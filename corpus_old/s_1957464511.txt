[Mickey and Minnie] "Mickey and
Minnie Wish upon a Christmas"


Come on, gang, follow me!

Right behind you!

Me, too!

Cowabunga Christmas!


Whooâ€hoo!
Oh, isn't this great?

Yeah, yeah, skiing in the cold.

Same thing every year.

Oh!

Hey! Watch it!

Whoa!





Whoa!

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Whoa! Whoa!


Isn't it beautiful?

Take it all in, everybody!

What a great time we've had

skiing in the French Alps.

[Donald sneezes]

Phew!


Oh, brother!

And the best is yet to come.

because tomorrow we go home
to Hot Dog Hills

to spend Christmas together!

Oh, I can't wait!

I've got the jingleâ€tingles
just thinking about it!

Oh, me, too, Daisy.

You're all family to me.

I just love the holiday traditions
we share, every Christmas,

starting on Christmas Eve.

[Minnie sings]
â™ª Goofy makes the hot dogs

â™ª That are shaped
Like candy canes â™ª

â€â™ª Cranberry ketchup, Mickey
â€You betcha!

â™ª And nobody complains

Delicious!

â™ª Daisy, she makes gifts

â™ª From a heart
Of Christmas cheer â™ª

â™ª This year I made you socks

â™ª The same pair
As last year â™ª

Loca Makes a cuckoo clock â™ª

â™ª From ginger bread

â™ª Merry Christmas
One and all â™ª

â™ª There's fun times
Up ahead â™ª

â™ª That's when I know

â™ª The merriest
Is yet to come â™ª

â™ª Sitting around
The fire place â™ª

â™ª Never feeling glum

[all singing]
â™ª The merriest

â™ª Is yet to be

â™ª A Christmas present

â€â™ª Made for you and me

Oh, boy!

â™ª I make custom
Christmas bows â™ª

â™ª So my gifts look
Extra chic â™ª

â™ª Mickey reads
The same story â™ª

"'Twas the night
before Christmas

And all through the house
not a creature was stirring,

not even a mouse."

And it only takes a week!

The Christmas tree â™ª

â™ª With miles and miles
Of lights â™ª

â™ª And when he adds
One string too many â™ª

â™ª It's just one
Of those nights â™ª

â€[music stops abruptly]
â€[power whirrs down]



Who turned out the lights?

â™ª Aw, phooey!
Why do we â™ª

â™ª Do the same thing
Every year â™ª

â™ª I'd rather do
Something different â™ª

â™ª Or exciting,
Do you hear? â™ª

â™ª The same thing's
No lame thing â™ª

â™ª When we get to be with you â™ª

â™ª That's what makes
The holiday special â™ª

â™ª And makes Christmas new

Humbug!

It'll be fun, Donald.

Come on, back to the chalet!

a rotten fruitcake!

Hey, wait! I don't wanna be
the rotten fruit cake!

I don't even like
regular fruit cake!

we know The merriest â™ª

â™ª Is yet to come â™ª

â™ª Can't wait for
That hot cocoa â™ª

â™ª And the treats
That are so yum â™ª

â™ª The merriest
Is yet to be â™ª

â™ª A Christmas present

â™ª Made for you and me

[laughter and chatter]

Hey, everybody, it's
time to play Present Pals!

â€Gawrsh!
â€Oh, goody good!

Another of my
favorite traditions!

Let's see which two pals are getting
presents for each other this year!

Donald with Goofy!

â€Hot dog!
â€Oh, boy!

Next is...

Minnie and me.

Oh, I can't wait to shop!

[Minnie chuckles]

And that means...




So, need any ideas
on what to get me?

Nah, I got this.

Well, then I won't
tell you about

the purple sparkly shoes...

in the gift shop.

Thanks for not telling me.

And if you need ideas
for my present, Donald,

how about...

a new yoâ€yo?

A flashlight, shoe laces
size extra long...

Oh, brother.

brown... a windâ€up robot


...with rainbow wings...


I just love this time of year.

Isn't this night amazing,
Donald?

I've never seen so many stars.

They sure are pretty.

[male voice] And magical.


Why, yes.

The Christmas Wishing Star is
the most magical star there is.

If you wish upon it,

your Christmas wish comes true.

will really come true?

Oh, yes, but only, if your wish
comes right from your heart.

Say, mister, how do you
know so much aboutâ€â€

[voice echoing] Ho ho ho!

Hey, who was that guy?

He looks familiar.

Ahh!
The Christmas wishing star...

So magical!

I'm gonna try it now.

I wish for something new
and exciting this Christmas.

Well, I wish that we're
all home together

in Hot Dog Hills
for Christmas.

Oh, dandy doodles!

It looks like we have
a little time to shop

for some goodieâ€goodies
before we leave for home.

Oh...

Uh, something the matter,
Donald?

â€My wish didn't come true.
â€What wish?

To do something new
and exciting this Christmas.

You see, last night,
a very nice man

told us about
the Christmas Wishing Star.

The Wishing Star?

Uhâ€huh! If you wish on it
with all your heart,

your Christmas wish
will come true.

But I guess I picked
the wrong star.

Or the wrong wish.

Oh, I know what
would cheer you up.

Gift shopping!

Just look around
at all the goodies!

[Donald quacks]

[Donald quacks]

[Donald quacks]

Yummy!

Oh, boy! Yeah!

Happy shopping, everybody!

See you all later
at the train station.

Bonjour, monsieur.

May I help you?

Bonjour! I'm looking
for the perfect Christmas gift

for somebody very special.
Her name's Minnie.

We have everything a mademoiselle
could want, monsieur !

â™ª This sterling silver
Typewriter â™ª

â™ª That doubles as a toaster

â™ª This tennis racketâ€mirror

â™ª That converts
Into a coaster â™ª

â™ª This portraiture of moi

â™ª So oohâ€laâ€la
They're going swift â™ª

â™ª Which one will make
For mademoiselle â™ª

â™ª The perfect gift?

â™ª The perfect gift
The perfect gift â™ª

â™ª It has to show how special
Minnie is to me â™ª

â™ª I must refuse

â™ª How could I choose?

â™ª I thank you so much
For your time â™ª

â™ª Au revoir, merci

â™ª These shoes
Are simply perfect â™ª

â™ª Comfy fit
And perfect color â™ª

â™ª Why, it's like
They were made for me â™ª

â€ â™ª Don't you agree?
â€ â™ª Oh, brother

â™ª Oh, no, dear Cuckoo Loca

â™ª Her attention
Tends to drift â™ª

â™ª Well, doodles, guess
I just won't get â™ª

â™ª The perfect gift

â™ª The perfect gift
The perfect gift â™ª

â™ª She thinks she's clever

â™ª But I'm steps ahead of her

â™ª The perfect gift â™ª

â™ª There's no such thing â™ª

â™ª I might as well
Stop trying â™ª

Here you go, monsieur ,

a sandwich with all the bologna
in the entire village!

Oh, boy! I'll take one of these
mustards from around the world.

Goofy will love this!

â™ª Now, what's the perfect
Christmas gift for Mickey? â™ª

â™ª Some socks or tools

â™ª Some practical machine? â™ª

â™ª For the guy
Who's got it all â™ª

â™ª It's kinda tricky

â™ª But I may just have found
The perfect figurine â™ª

â™ª It's magical as Mickey

â™ª So that's just why
I love him â™ª

â™ª Hey, mister
Can you wrap this? â™ª

â™ª For a gift
There's too much of it â™ª

â™ª Ah, no, monsieur, so sorry

â™ª We've no boxes
In this size â™ª

â™ª Oh, that's okay
He'll never know â™ª

â™ª That wrapped up
In disguise â™ª

â™ª It's my gift â™ª

â™ª My perfect gift

â™ª Your bag looks so large â™ª

â™ª I notice, shoebox sized

Stop noticing!


â™ª Will give them such a lift

â™ª That when they see them

â™ª They'll be
Perfectly surprised â™ª

Still haven't found...

â€â™ª The perfect gift
â€ â™ª Where can it be?

â€â™ª The perfect gift
â€ â™ª Perfect as sheâ™ª

â™ª To guarantee I'll make her
Christmas spirit climb â™ª

â™ª It's so much better
We believe â™ª

â™ª To give than to receive

Well, Donald, I got you
a Christmas present

And you'll never guess
what it is.

Oh, boy, a fishingâ€â€

â™ª 'Cause that's how you make

â™ª A perfect Christmas time

Okay, everybody, we've got a long
journey home to hot Dog Hills.

Let's use
my Personal Pal Tracker

to show us how
we're getting home.

First, we take
the train to the city.

Then, the bus to the seaport.

And finally, we board the
cruise ship for Hot Dog Hills.

And then we celebrate
Christmas at home together!

That's my favorite thing
in the whole wide world.

Mine, too!

Same old thing.

Hello! Are you all going home
for the holidays?

Next train is leaving
in just a few minutes.

Let's get on the train so we
don't miss one merry moment.

â€[Mickey] Hiya!
â€[Minnie] Hi.

â€Hello.
â€Thank you kindly.

Hey, aren't you...?

Nah.

[cheerful chatter]

[chomps and munches]

How's your sandwich, Donald?

Needs mustard.

Oh!

Oh...

No, I mustn't.

Oh, this is so exciting!

Tonight's Christmas Eve

And we'll all be together.

That's going to be wonderful!

Hot Dog Hills,
we're coming home!

Ooh, who wants to go,
check out the snack car?

â€I do!
â€[Goofy] Me, too.

â€[Minnie] Oh, yummy! â€[Mickey] I
wonder what kind of snacks they have.

No, I can't.

Oh, delish!

You got a little on ya.

Huh?


I ate Goofy's present.

Be right back.

â€But, Donald...
â€[conductor] All aboard!

The train's about to leave.

Daisy?!

Oh, I gotta buy
another batch of mustards.

Donald, hurry!

Donald!

Daisy, we gotta get back
on the train!

But Donald will miss it.

What are we worried about?

These trains
never leave on time.

[bell rings]

â™ª Chuggin' chuggin'
Down the tracks â™ª

â™ª There's nothin' better
Than havin' snacks! â™ª

Hey, where are Daisy,
Donald, and Cuckoo Loca?

[phone rings and beeps]

Oh, it's Daisy.

Hi, Daisy.
Did you switch cabins?

we switched trains.

We'll have to take the next one
because we missed the one you're on.

You missed the train?!

But we have to be together
for Christmas!

Aw, don't worry, Minnie.

We'll all be together.
They'll catch up to us.

Yeah, I'm sure another train
will be right along.

Okay, Daisy. See you soon!

The next train to the city

departs tomorrow at noon.

What?! Quackers!

No way are we missin'
a single jingle!

Not on my watch!

You're right! We'll find
another way to the city.

Well, we better find Donald.

Here,
I'll carry your shopping bag.

Not a chance.

Just one peek?

â€No! â€Oh, come on!
Just let me touch it.

â€No!
â€Weigh it?

â€No!
â€Xâ€ray it?

No! It's aâ€â€

Huh?!

Cuckoo Loca!

Daisy!

Don't worry!
I'll catch the next one!

Sorry, Miss. That's the last
cable car for a while.

Oh, no!
I gotta find Donald!

â€Donald!
â€Huh?

Thank you very much.

â€â™ª Deck the halls with
Boughs of holly â™ª â€Donald!

â€â™ª Fa la la la la La
la la la laâ™ª â€Daisy?

â™ª 'Tis the season
To be jolly â™ª

â€â™ª Fa la la la la
La la la la laâ™ª â€Huh?

Daisy!

Daisy, wait!

Last boarding call!

Daisy? Ha!


You're not Daisy!

Donald!

â€Daisy!
â€Donald!

Come back!

I can't!

Oh, Donald.

Ah! Oh...

Say, you must be new.
Welcome!

Is this your first time
to the island?

"Island"?

To celebrate Christmas.

We're on our way
to a tropical island!

fun in the water...

fresh beach air...

lots of sand... great music...

and coconut milkshakes!

Oh, boy, oh, boy!

Now this is different!

My Christmas wish
is coming true!

It'll be fun!

Ah, I don't need this anymore!

I gotta ask somebody how to
get back up theâ€â€

Buongiorno!

"Buongiorno"?
That doesn't sound French.

Welcome to Italy!

Italy?!

Oh, frozen puddles.

How am I gonna get down
the mountain

to the city
to meet everybody?

Madame, maybe you'd like to
borrow this snowmobile?

If you hurry, you can catch the
last bus at the bottom of the hill.

Thanks for the loaner!

I really need to get back home
for Christmas

with all my friends!

That sounds wonderful.

You do know how to drive
a snowmobile, don't you?

Sure! Easy peasy!

Be careful!

Ahh!



Huh?! Ahhh!

Oof! Whoa whoa!

Whoa!

Ahh!

Whew!

Ahh! Ooh! Ah!

Ahh!

Hmph.

â€That wasn't so bad.
â€[engine starts]

The bus!

No! Stop!

Aw, quackers!

Oh, goodyâ€good!

Ahh!

Doodles! Now what?

I don't see Donald.

Or Daisy or Cuckoo Loca.

And it's going to be
Christmas soon!

â€Let me check my Pal Tracker.
â€[beeps]

Oh, no! I'm not sure the app
is working right now.

I'll... check it
in a little while.

But we better go
catch our bus.

Aha!

Golly, this station
sure is a big place.

Uh, let's make sure
we don't get separated.

Oops, sorry, Mick!


It looks like we catch our bus
down that way.

Huh?! Oh, no!

â€Oh, my!
â€Huh?!

Wow! The cart!

Runaway cart!

Mickey!

It's okay, Minnie,
we'll meet you on the bus!

â€Oh, dear!
â€Hey, Goofy!

Maybe you can use the fishing
pole to stop the cart!

Say, how'd you know
it was a fishing pole?!

Lucky guess?

Time to go fishin' for luggage!

Got a bite!
Whoa, she's a fighter!

Yaâ€hoo!

Whoa!

I'm coming, Goofy!

Whoa! Whoa!

H'yuk!

â€Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
â€Whoa!

â€[people scream]
â€Look out, Mickey!

Ahh!

â€Waâ€hoo!
â€Huh?

Ha ha!

Goofy! Load up the luggage!

Let's go!

Whoa!

Great job, Goof!

Now let's get to our bus!

Hey, look, Goof.
There's Minnie!

Let's go!

[bus beeps]

[phone rings]

â€[beeps]
â€Hiya, Daisy.

I'm lost!

Don't worry, Daisy!
I'll help ya!

â€[line rings]
â€Oh, hold on, Daisy.

â€[beeps]
â€Hi, Cuckoo Loca!

So I, uh,
made it to the city.

â€[Mickey] You did?
â€ Yeah. The city of Rome.

â€Rome?! â€ Italy? Is
Donald with either of you?

No, he flew away.

He can fly?

I forgot to mention the part
about "in a blimp."

I better call him.
Hang on!

â€Donald! â€[munching]
Hi, Mickey.

Now, listen, gang, there's still
time to meet up before Christmas!

New plan! Everyone
meet at the seaport

and we'll all board
the cruise ship

and sail home
to Hot Dog Hills together.

[Daisy and Cuckoo Loca]
Got it!

â€[slurps]
â€[Mickey] Donald?

Huh? Oh, right. Got it.

â€Au revoir!
â€See ya soon!

Uh, are there
any more cookies?

Come on, Goofy,
we can't miss this bus!

Oh, I don't see
Minnie anywhere.

Gawrsh! Me neither.


I didn't realize you were
sitting right next to me!

Careful, Goof.

â€No, Mickey, no!
â€[chuckles]

Well, we'll be
on our way soon andâ€â€

â€Mickey!
â€Huh? Minnie!

Goof, Minnie's on
a different bus!

She got on the wrong bus?!

Yeah! Or, uh, we did!

Excuse me!
Where does this bus go?

â€Paris.
â€Paris?!

But the seaport isn't in Paris!

â€Can you let me and my
friend off? â€Let you off?

Why, don't ya know
it's the holidays?

And I got a schedule to keep.

â€So, no one off till Paris!
â€[people gasp]


Aw, nutcrackers!

Well, Goofy, I guess we won't
be able to spend Christmas

with our best pals.

â€No storytelling or decorating
the tree. â€[people gasp]

Or hot dogs or gingerbread.

Or presents.

Why, that would be the
worst Christmas ever! [sobs]

[brakes screech]

Thanks, Mr. Bus Driver!
Merry Christmas!

And Happy New Year!

â€Same, same!
â€[all] Merry Christmas!

Come on, Goofy!
Let's get our luggage.

Whoa!

Wait!

We didn't get our luggage!

â€[bus beeps]
â€[Mickey] Oh, rats!

Well, the good news is
it'll be easier to travel

â€without all the
suityâ€cases. â€That's true.

Well, now we gotta find a way
to the seaport.

Extracted from RETAIL by balloumowgly

On your way home, monsieurs?

Say, I think things
are lookin' up!

That they are, Goofy!

We're all gonna make it
home in time for Christmas!

I can feel it!

[Caribbeanâ€style
Christmas music]

Come on, guys,

let's take this
Christmas party to the beach!


Conga Christmas, everybody!

You know it!

Oh, boy!

This is gonna be
the greatest Christmas ever!


I'm making a sand angel!

Oh, no! Oh, no!

I left Goofy's present
up there! I gottaâ€â€

Hey, Donald, let's decorate
the tree with seashells!

Seashells? That's new!

Can I put on the lights?

I do that every Christmas
with my friends.

Sure! You can
put on the lights!

Oh, boy!



Aw, pickles!

Donald, Daisy and Cuckoo Loca
are nowhere near the seaport.

Golly gee willikers!

And it's gettin' closer
to Christmas!

I still have to find the
perfect present for Minnie.

Hmm. There are many stores
around here.

Stop!

Be right back, Goofy.
Hold the taxi.

You got it, Mickey!

We won't move an inch!

You are blocking traffic!

Thanks, Mister! I gotta find
my good pal Mickey!

â€ Oui oui, can I help you? â€Oh,
it's okay. We'll catch another cab.

Merry Christmas!

Yes, you, too! And try
to stay with your friend.

Hot dog!

Minnie will love this!

A bow bracelet in a box
that looks like

a gingerbread cookie!

Hmm. Now which store
did Mickey go in?

Oh, I still don't see anyone.

I sure hope someone's on board.

Okay, come on, everyone!

Let's go home for Christmas!

Oh! Won't it be so
wonderful spending it together?

[phone rings]

Daisy! Where are you?
I'm at the seaport.

I'll be there soon, Minnie!

The cable cars
are running again

so I'm taking it down
the mountain.

I just have to be sure not to
end up in Rome,

like Cuckoo Loca.

Oh, dear.

We all have to be together
for Christmas!

Is Donald with you?

No, but he's floatin' around
somewhereâ€â€

Oh, the cable car's coming,
Minnie!

Gotta go!

Goodyâ€good.
Finally getting somewhere!

Wait.

Why are we going up
when we should be going down?!

Nooo!

Seaport?

Si, signorina!

â€[crash]
â€[air hissing]

Of course, it broke down.

Hey!

Daisy's present! No!

Wait! Stop!

Whoa!

What else can go wrong?

Bye bye! Good day!

Thanks for waiting, driver.

Hot dog, Goofy!

Look what I got
Minnie for Christmas!

A bowâ€youtiful bow bracelet!

Goofy? Aw, jingles!

Now we're separated, too!

Hmm. Now where did Mickey go?

Mickey! Wait!

I better catch up to him!

Taxi!

Oh, how lovely.

If only my friends were here.

They just have to make it!

Excuse me, Captain,

when does
the cruise ship leave?

Soon, Miss. Very soon!

Oh, but my friends
aren't here yet!

Well, they'd better hurry.

Christmas waits for no one
and neither does this ship!

Oh, where are they?

â™ª Christmas is for family
Christmas is for friends â™ª

â™ª Christmastime's
To celebrate â™ª

â™ª A love that never ends

â™ª Christmas is togetherness

â™ª With the folks
Who fill your heart â™ª

â™ª So how can there
Be Christmas â™ª

â™ª If we are apart?

â™ª All I want for Christmas

â™ª Is Mickey's silly laugh

â™ª Cuckoo Loca baking pie

â™ª And Donald eating half

â™ª Daisy leading carols
So we all can sing along â™ª

â™ª Goofy's goofy giggle

â™ª As he gets
A few words wrong â™ª

â™ª We'd sail off
On a sleigh ride â™ª

â™ª We'd play a reindeer game

â™ª But if you're not here
By my side â™ª

â™ª It wouldn't be the same

â™ª So all these decorations

â™ª This tinselâ€covered tree

â™ª Friends,
They're not just Christmas â™ª

â™ª Without you home
With me... â™ª

Oh, please let it be
a Merry Christmas...

Thanks for the ride!
Merry Christmas!


Whoa! Hey, hey! Stop that!

It's not real gingerbread!

It's a box!

â™ª We wish you
A Merry Christmas â™ª

â™ª We wish you
A Merry Christmas â™ª

Oh, no!

â™ª And a Happy New Year

Oh, stocking stuffers,
not Minnie's present!

Merry Christmas!

Happiest Holidays!

Oh, rats!

â€[honks]
â€Huh?

Oh, I'm not missing this ship!


Oh, someone has to
make it for Christmas!


Hurry, Mickey!


You can make it!



[soft Christmas music]

[record scratch]

I'm sorry, mouse fellow,
but that ship has sailed.

Butâ€â€ Oh...

Oh, Mickey!
It's almost Christmas

and I'm the only one going
home to Hot Dog Hills!

I know, Minnie, uhâ€â€

There's got to be
another way home!

Mickey!
We haven't tried a plane!

Great idea!
I'll get back to you!


Go, Goofy, go!

Atta boy, Goofy!

Wa ha hooo!

I made it! H'yuck!

I better go find Minnie!

My fishin' pole!

Oh, no!
Not Donald's present!


Minnie! Minnie?
Where are you?

Goofy! Goofy?

Oh, no! Now he's on
the wrong ship!

[suspenseful music]

Minnie? Oh!

You're not Minnie.

Welcome aboard, researchers!

We're on our way to
the penguin colonies

in Antarctica!

"Antarctica"?!


Do you have any tickets
to Hot Dog Hills?

Oh, I'm sorry,
those are sold out.

No seats available
till a week from Tuesday.

â€Butâ€â€
â€[phone rings]

Mickey, did you get
plane tickets?

I'm afraid not, Minnie.

Oh, puddles!

And it's getting dark now.

Even the stars are coming out!

Though they do look beautiful.

[line rings]

Hold on, Minnie.

Hi, Daisy!
Where are you?!

Um... back at the chalet.

[Mickey and Minnie]
"Back at the chalet"?!

[line rings]

Cuckoo Loca! Goofy!
Where are you?

Roamin' around Rome!

I can't find
a way out of this place!

But the pizza is really good.

I'd sure love
a nice hot pizza.

But I'm on my way to...
Antarctica!


Oh, dear, everyone.

And now it's Christmas Eve!

All I wished for Christmas was
for us to be together!

Wellâ€â€ even though we're not
in the same placeâ€â€

at least weâ€â€ can talk to
each other...

â€[signal breaking]
â€[all] Minnie? Guys? Hello?

Oh, no! We've got problems
with our cell phones!

Guys, keep trying to get home!

And try to reach Donald!

And Merry Christmas!


Cowabunga Christmas!

Happy Holidays, dude!




Oh, boy!

Yeah!



It's time to light up
the Christmas tree!

Ready!

Three, two, one!

Lights!


[power drones]


I put too many lights on...
again.

Oh, that's okay, Donald,
we're still having fun.


This reminds me of...
my best friends.

You see... Celebrating our
traditions together...

is what makes
the holiday so special.

Christmas Christmas!

Guys!

Aww. It wasn't real.

Just my imagination.


There must be a way we can
all be together tonight.

[horn blows]

Gee, I don't know how else
to get us all home.

â€[beeping]
â€Wait a minute.

The Christmas Wishing Star
can make a wish come true!

I need to wish
with all my heart!

And Minnie said that someone
told her the Wishing Star

is the brightest and
most magical star of them all!

So...

Here comes my wish!

â™ª The ripple
You start in the ocean â™ª

Huh?


â€Mickey!
â€Santa! It's you!

Um...
did you ever drive a taxi?

Ho ho ho ho!

I wear many hats, kiddo.

But this one's my favorite.

So climb in, Mickey!

You and Minnie
are getting your wish.

You and your pals
are going to be together

for Christmas!

So I made a good wish
after all?

You sure did.

And it came
right from your heart.

And that's the best wish
anyone can ever make.

Minnie's gonna be so happy!

So is everybody!

Now let's find your friends!

Up, up, and away!

I can show you where all my
friends are on my Pal Tracker.

Ho ho! No need.

I've got this, Mickey.

It's kinda my thing.

It's gonna be a lonely
Christmas without my friends.

Huh?

Oh!

Merry Christmas, Daisy!

Krerry Mistmas, Goofy!

You mean Mickey.

You're... Santa... Claus.

Merry Christmas, Daisy!

Ho ho ho!

my friends isn't merry at all.

Huh?

[Mickey and Daisy] Cuckoo Loca!

Mama Mia! Bonasera!

Buon Natale!

I spent so much time in Italy,
I speak fluent Italian!

Pizza? [giggles]

Ah!

Up, Dasher! Up, Dancer!

Ho ho ho ho!

[cheering and chatter]


Another round of
"Jingle Bells," Donald?

No, thank you.

Are you okay?

You're all very nice butâ€â€

I miss my best friends.

We were supposed to
spend Christmas together.

I think not being with your
best friends

is making you realize
just how much they mean to you.


I wish they were here.


Oh, no, I'm not
falling for that again!

Santa and my pals.

Just my imagination.

Hi, Donald!

You're all really here?

Hiya, Donald!

Ho ho!

And Santa, too?!

This time your wish
came true, Donald!

It was made
right from your heart.

Merry Christmas!

Oh, boy! Is it ever!

Hey, I know you!

You're the fella
from the chalet.

And the train toâ€â€


Goodbye, Jenny!

Goodbye, Henry!

I'm going home to celebrate
with my best friends.

Have a Merry Christmas!

We will! Goodbye!



[both gasp]
That was Santa Claus!


And one for you,
and one for you!

And one for you!

Merry Christmas, Goofy!

Well, whatta ya know!

These penguin fellers talk!


Ho ho ho!

It's muh pals!

And Santy Claus!

Bye, fellers, and Merry Merry!

Hot diggity sleigh ride!




No reason to make bows

because there's no one
to give any presents to.


Merry Christmas, Mickey.
Daisy. Donald. Goofy.

And Cuckoo Loca.

Hmm.

â€[sleigh bells ring]
â€What was that?!

Mickey?


Merry Christmas, Minnie!

â€H'yuck.
â€Oh, you're here!

I couldn't be happier
to see you all!

Oh, Mickey, you made our
Christmas wishes come true.

You got everybody back home.

Well, I did have
a little bit of help.

Merry Christmas!

Oh, Santa, it's you!

You were the one who told us
about the Wishing Star!

Thank you for bringing us
all together!

Mickey and Minnie,
it was both your wishes,

straight from the heart,

that has made this
the merriest Christmas of all!

And to all a good night!

Ho ho ho!

Oh, my!

It finally feels like
Christmas!

Yeah. Even though
we don't have any presents.

Being together for Christmas
is the best gift of all!

[Goofy and Donald]
You said it, Minnie!


Our presents!

Hot diggity dog!

This truly is
the best Christmas ever!

â™ª What makes
Christmas Christmas? â™ª

â™ª What makes
Christmas Christmas? â™ª

â™ª It's not
A bowâ€shaped bracelet â™ª

â™ª It's not found in a box

â™ª It isn't sparkling
Purple shoes â™ª

â™ª Or a pair of silly socks!

â™ª Don't look for
Christmas spirit â™ª

â™ª To come from just a toy

â™ª Because you'll find
It's something else â™ª

â™ª That brings the season joy

â™ª What makes
Christmas Christmas â™ª

â™ª Is not what things you get

â™ª If you think the key
Is only what you see â™ª

â™ª Then you ain't
Seen nothin' yet! â™ª

â™ª Love my brand new
Fishin' pole â™ª

â™ª But the catch
Is something new â™ª

â™ª 'Cause what makes
Christmas Christmas â™ª

â™ª Is sharing it with you!

Christmas and all through the house,

â€not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse. â€[giggling]

â€This year, I made you...
â€[all] We know! Socks!

And scarves, too!

â™ª What makes
Christmas Christmas â™ª

â™ª Is standing hand in hand

â™ª Being back as one
We can have more fun â™ª

â™ª Than a million plans
We planned â™ª

â™ª When we sing our favorite
Christmas songs â™ª

â™ª Peace on Earth and joy
Break through â™ª

â™ª 'Cause what makes
Christmas Christmas â™ª

â™ª Is sharing it with you!

[power drones]

[power boosts]




â™ª What makes
Christmas Christmas â™ª

â™ª Is sharing it with you!
