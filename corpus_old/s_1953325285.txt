people talk about fate...

How everything happens
for a reason.

But I never believed that.

I can't find a single reason
why I deserve a second chance.

Today is the day that I die.

Slide it away.

I said fucking
slide it away now.

Nighty night, asshole.

Go!

Fuck!

Fuck!

I need you to call 9-1-1.

Tell them detective
Callahan's in pursuit.

No, don't leave me.

He's done this before.

I'm not going to let him do it again.
Call it in!

Motherfucker.

Fucking...

Arrogant prick.

You come up with anything?

Yeah, found these
under his mattress.

He was keeping mementos.

Mm-hmm. You want to
rattle his cage?

Nah, give it to scanlon.

You afraid you might blow it?

I just thought if
you drop the ball,

I'm in reserve to clean it up.

Sorry, what was that?
Lieutenant,

district attorney asked
loughlin to sit in on this one.

Is it true?
Randall mcalister.

14 years on the job.

Have you notified
internal affairs?

Our collar, our case.

Yeah, it's best to keep
these things in-house.

Make it airtight.

Airtight?
Go get 'em, sluggo.

So, you got a thing
for brunettes, huh?

Look what we found.

Look at that.

You know what? It's
late, I'm tired,

and I got to go walk my dog,

so why don't you just keep
this really simple, okay?

You plead guilty to six counts

of sexual assault
in the first degree

to be served consecutively,

and we'll spare your family
the embarrassment of a trial.

Or option number two,

he could plead down to
six lesser charges,

to be served concurrently in
a minimum-security facility.

Wow, you got some balls
there, counselor.

For 14 years, my client

was an exemplary member of
this police department,

so why would he
hypothetically go astray?

Who gives a shit?
Where the hell is this going?

About a year ago, my client's
wife of 10 years left him.

Busted my ass for that woman.

Gave her everything
she ever wanted.

So you married an
ungrateful bitch.

Wow. Welcome to the club.

After his wife abandoned him,

my client divulged
his extreme feelings

to your department shrink.

News flash, asshole.

He didn't rape his wife.

Didn't he?

Jesus.

All the women look
like his ex-wife.

Six women sexually assaulted
by a police officer,

and you could have prevented it?
Fallout's going to be immeasurable.

Only if it becomes
public knowledge.

Wait a minute. Captain,
you're not seriously thinking

of cutting a deal with this
piece of shit, are you?

Take a breath.
What do you think I was doing?

You need to take a deep breath
and think long and hard

about what course
of action is best

for the preservation of this
department's reputation.

For once, detective.

Well, anyways, mm-hmm, yeah.

Oh, my God, so we had
such an awesome time.

Well, I asked her,

but she said she had
to think about it.

Yeah, really. So
who else is going?

Is mark going to be there?

He's okay, I guess.

Why, did he say
something about me?

Hold on a second, Jenny.

What?

Who's mark?

Just a boy from school.

Five minutes.

Okay. Bye.

Sorry. That was my dad.

He's like, "who's mark?"

So, anyway... so did he
say anything about me?

Hi.

Did you just talk to lanie?

Yeah. Who's mark?

It's just a boy.

Mm-hmm.

How you feeling?

Tired.

Do you believe in fate?

I thought I did.

It's a beautiful family.

You got a lot to
be thankful for.

If I were you,

I'd consider myself the
luckiest man on the planet.

Wipe the slate.

Oh, that guy who saved you...

What about him?

You tell me.

He was the only witness
to what really went down.

I don't remember
anything about him.

Really?

Ah, well.

Too bad.

Been meaning to come see you.

Cal, the church isn't just

for the bad times.

Yeah, I know.

What about your nightmares?

Yeah, still having those.

I don't know, father.

I disrespected the
woman that I love,

violated my oath to
protect and serve.

Just don't know why I
got a second chance.

Or who've I got to
thank for that chance.

This good samaritan,

I'm sure the good lord will
cross your paths someday.

I hope so.

Are you still drinking?

No.

I've been sober for
almost two years,

ever since the shooting.

Can't tell you I'm not
craving it, though.

Hey, I mean it.

David Callahan?

Yeah?

You don't remember me?

No. How would I know you?

My name is Sergei,
Sergei dronov.

I'm sorry. How do
we know each other?

We met once before...

On the corner of
water and frontage.

Hey!

Hey!

Hang in there, buddy. You're
going to be just fine.

My wife, tell her I'm sorry.

Tell her yourself, okay?

Please.

You hear those sirens?
They'll be here any second.

Just hold on, okay?

So why'd you leave?

You just vanished.

I didn't know who you were or
what you were involved in.

I went on TV. I was begging
for somebody to come forward.

Where I come from,

it is best not to get
involved with the police.

I didn't even tell my wife about
what happened that night.

So why now?

Because of this.

Yeah? Larussa.

Hey, lieu, it's Cal. You busy?
No. What's up?

I just got into a
little Fender bender.

You all right?

I'm fine.

Hey, I lost the guy's
business card, though.

You got a name?

His name was Sergei dronov.

Hold on. What? Say it again.

Sergei dronov.

Dronov. D-r-o-n-o-v, I think.

Yeah, I got it. I
got an address.

It's 423 gladstone.

Phone number also.
You want it?

I didn't even tell my wife

about what happened that night.

My daughter zhanna...

I found this journal when I was
cleaning out her apartment.

Will you help me?

I've got to get a job.

The scholarship isn't enough to support me.
Feeling of loneliness.

This is the third time a teacher
asked me why I don't have an accent.

Just because I have a
weird Russian name.

I came here when I was two.
Can't say hello in Russian.

This was the worst date ever.

I have to do better for
mom and dad's sake.

These men... the correct
word is these "boys."

I'm such an idiot.
All of us, so young.

They sacrificed everything for
me to have a better life.

Some even younger than me.
What am I thinking?

I want to tell them
to save themselves.

I was not happy about.
Get out.

My mom wouldn't stop crying.
Began writing a paper

for my social
anthropology class.

The assignment was to
analyze a cultural ritual.

I picked a safe topic...

Funerals.

But if I had any guts,

I would have written about
how I pay for school.

I take off my clothes for money.

Walking through the curtain
for the first time

was the hardest thing
I've ever done.

The closer I got,

the more I wanted to turn
and never stop running.

For the first time
on our stage,

introducing the
beautiful roxy.

Hey, honey.

Hi, dad.

I'm making you breakfast.

Can I have cereal?

No. That's just sugar.
You always eat cereal.

Today we're going to have some eggs...
Protein.

Hello.
Whoa.

Good morning, honey.
Trying to bulk me up?

No, I want you to sit down.
Sit down.

I'm making my two
gals breakfast today.

Your eggs are coming right up.

Three shots in the chest.

Stumbled here to bleed out.

I see nothing but anger
in so many eyes.

I wonder how they treat
their women in their lives

as I let my thoughts drift

to someplace peaceful
and far away.

Still, they're not all bad.

Some are just lonely

and want nothing
more than a smile,

someone to recognize
that they exist.

Hey.

Hey.

Mom had to run some errands.
You got me today.

How was school?
Boring.

Boring?
Yeah. Isn't that what it usually is?

I don't know what
school was like

when you were a kid a
million years ago.

Seat belt.
Yes, sir.

I never walked
to my car alone.

It was against the rules,

but it was late, and I didn't
feel like waiting around.

He was waiting for
me at my car.

I knew his face. He was
a regular at the club.

The other dancers
call him angel.

He used to draw me.

I thought it was
sweet at the time.

Help me, please!

I lay awake at night

and tell myself I'm
lucky to be alive

and it's okay that I
didn't report it.

The police wouldn't
have believed me.

I'm a stripper. I
was asking for it.

I was not going to subject
myself to any more humiliation.

Sometimes I believe my excuses

long enough to drift
off to sleep.

But he's always waiting
in my nightmares.

He'll never let me forget

that I am helpless and pathetic

and he has control.

It makes me so angry,

more than what he did to me

or what he took from me,

what I didn't do in return.

I didn't stop him from
hurting anyone else.

He's still out there...

Ready to strike again.

Oleg...

Ladies, I know one
after-hours club,

the best one, 'cause
you're the best.

The best ladies, best club.

Oleg, don't make
me work tonight.

â™ª When the club let out â™ª

â™ª meet me outside â™ª

â™ª meet me outside,
girl meet me outside â™ª

â™ª new iced-out watch... â™ª

The ladies appreciate any
tip you may give them.

And for $25, a private
dance can be yours

in our champagne room.

Desire... where all
your dreams come true.

Bourbon, neat.

â™ª drunk off stress,

â™ª saw one coming... â™ª
oh, yeah, I remember that guy.

Never thought I'd see
you in here again.

Neither did I.

You going to waste that?

It's all yours.

I take it this isn't
a social visit.

Hmm. I need some
information, Walker.

What kind?

Guy drawing pictures over there,
what do you know about him?

He's a regular...

Just like you used to be.

Got a name?
I've seen him talking to oleg.

Now, if this ain't official
police business...

Who said it's not?

Many ways for an officer of the
law to put a name to a face, Cal.

Straight and narrow's
done you good.

â™ª Chilling all the time,
know you feeling it... â™ª

Don't fuck it up.
â™ª cheers â™ª

â™ª celebration â™ª

â™ª make a hot stove

â™ª new iced-out watch,

â™ª yeah â™ª
â™ª chilling all the time â™ª

â™ª know you feeling it. â™ª

Mmm. You sexy girl.

Cal, please, I need
to talk to you.

Huh?
I need to talk to you, please.

Give me a second.

I owe oleg a lot of money

for bringing me here,

but you know

I don't have such money.

I can never repay him.

So what do you want me
to do about it, babe?

You're a cop. You can help me.

Please.

Oleg's got something going,

something big.

Oleg's got something
going for what, for me?

What am I getting out of it?

You take oleg, take the money,

then help me get
out of this place.

If it's so big,

Walker must know
about it, honey.

No. No.

It's oleg's deal.

Royce Walker doesn't
know about it.

Cal, help me.

I just want to get
away from here.

Okay, I'll think about it, okay?

But I don't want to talk here.
I'll talk later to you,

when I'm not so high.

Relax.

Relax, Katya. Jesus Christ.

Why aren't I getting
any lap dances?

I mean, I want some
fucking lap dancing.

Hey.

Hey. Hey.

Oh, my God.

You okay with that?

It's okay, Freddie.

Here's my card.

I need your help, Katya.

My help?

Where have you been
when I needed you?

I'm sorry, okay? I
had some problems.

I was a different
person back then.

It was a different time.

I'll make some calls...
It's too late, Cal.

I can help you now.
I'm deep into this shit now.

Look...

I need some information
on the guy in the club

that's sketching pictures
of all the girls.

You know who I'm talking about?

Of course. We all do.

I need his real name.

Find out yourself,

piece of shit.

Come on.

Hey, hey. It's angel, right?

Why are you leaving so soon?

Huh? Come get a drink with me, baby.
Come on.

That's so rude.

Nothing in name for 613 n4l.

You sure it's a local plate?

That's what it says.

Not in the system.
Thanks.

Yeah, right.

I understand. It's just
that I just got home.

You know, it's really
fucking late at night.

I mean, I don't...

Okay. All right, where
do you want me to go?

Yeah, I know where that is.

â™ª And I just can't slow â™ª

â™ª the beating of my heart â™ª

â™ª that you give
me arrhythmia â™ª

â™ª give me arrhythmia â™ª

Come on.
Okay.

Let's go.

â™ª That you give me arrhythmia. â™ª

Hey, guys, give it
up for Natasha.

Nice one.

From Russia with love.

â™ª Like a fool. â™ª

I don't bring work
to you anymore, man!

Huh?! Whoa. No.

Put your gun on the
ground, you pimp.

Let's go. Put it down.

A round of applause for
the lovely crystal.

Let's give it up
for crystal, guys.

You take care of
that problem for me?

He wasn't home.
Well, try again.

Just give it to oleg, all right?

I'm done for the day, Walker.

I'm asking you.

You look like a piece of shit.

Pull the strings

and watch 'em dance.

Try again.

Yeah?

Where are you?

I'm working, okay?

You're lying to me.

I told you I'm in the middle
of a fucking investigation.

I keep telling myself that
you're going to finally

realize what you're
doing to yourself...

What do you think I'm doing?
...To us,

and you're going to
care enough to stop,

but you want to know what?

You're never going
to care enough.

What are you saying?

Your daughter is growing up
without a fucking father!

Fuck!

Hey, buddy.

Hey, oleg.

I was looking for you.
Yeah? What's up?

Let's go for a ride.

You going to tell me
where we're going, oleg?

Pull over right here.

Here?
Here.

It's between you and me.

Okay.

20 keys of uncut powder

coming on the long island ferry.

I'm going to give you one key.

It's going to keep you happy
for a very long time, eh?

I'm listening.

We are waiting for
two black guys.

I was told they're going to
be driving a red mustang.

Red mustang, eh?

We're going to be out here?
Why?

Everyone's so exposed
out here like this.

I don't see a boat at all.
Well, what can I do?

So you going to steal my
deal, and you thought

you gonna fucking
tell her what to do?

I know what Katya tell you.

I know you want to rob my deal.

We are waiting for
two black guys.

I was told they're going to
be driving a red mustang.

I don't do business
like this, man.

You paid us for one
fucking thing,

and one thing in
particular, man.

I'm serious. What you got
us out here doing, man?

I don't know what's going on.
You ain't here.

Got my man here sitting on
this in the fucking trunk.

I ain't playing no fucking games
out here and shit right now.

We in a place where I don't
fucking know what's going on.

This dude playing
games right now.

Look, you paid us to bring
it up, and that's all.

I ain't trying to sit on
this shit all night, man.

Look, man, that ain't
going to work.

I ain't feeling this
right now, man, huh?

Hey, man, what did he say?
This motherfucker

talking about he don't know
where the other dude at.

Well, he going to meet us

over at artisan park
in, like, 15 minutes.

See? This the shit I'm
talking about, man.

Yo, man. Man, let's go.
Better be there.

Hey, why not?
Come on, lanie.

Mom, please?

Enough with this party.

Have you seen this?
Huh?

It's the third quarter her
grades have dropped in a row.

But, mom, it has
nothing to do with it.

Can you just talk
to him, please?

Talk to me about what?

So what are we talking about?

Jenny's having a slumber
party, but it's coed,

so it's never going to happen.
Coed?

So let me guess. Mark's going?
Dad!

To tell you the truth, these
grades are garbage. No party.

You guys were never kids.
It's so annoying.

Need to do better in school, honey.
Whatever!

Maybe we should get her a tutor.
Yeah, that's a good idea.

Can you help me out with that?
'Cause I...

Yeah.

Hold on one sec.

I got to take this, babe.
Then I got to change.

Yeah, go.

What we looking at, brogan?

Darwinism. Urban
survival of the fittest.

How did it go down?

Drive-by.

As luck would have it,
we caught the shooter.

Any witnesses?

Ah, their friend got grazed.

He claims he didn't see
who fired the shots.

Now let me ask him
a few questions.

Excuse me. Thanks, guys.

I'll talk to him.

Man, what the fuck
is your problem?

You don't remember me, do you?

Why would I?

Let me refresh your memory.

You remember this? Huh?

Shit!

Shit! What the fuck, man?

Shit's in the frame.
Just be cool, man.

Be cool? Man, what the fuck?

Can't be fucking serious.

You boys in a hurry?

I'm sorry about that, officer.
I just got the car.

I ain't used to the power.

You wouldn't happen to
have any drugs or alcohol

in here now, would you?
No, sir, officer.

No?

You ain't lying to
me now, are you?

Aw, come on, man.
No, sir.

Well, you don't mind if I
take a look then, do you?

Step out of the vehicle. Thanks.

We just want to
go home, officer.

Yeah, I know. I said
step out of the vehicle.

Hey, I said step out of
the vehicle now. Get out.

Hey, what are you doing?

Yo, man, what the fuck?

Why you shoot him for?

I'm going to handle this shit.

You ain't have to
fucking shoot him!

Get the fuck in the car, man.

Look, I don't know
nothing about that, man.

Yeah?
Hey, shit, man.

Come on. Fucking...

Shut up and come here.
God damn.

It's just you and me
talking right now, okay?

But I can change in a
heartbeat, so it's up to you.

Yeah.

I remember seeing you on TV,

everybody all
weepy-eyed and shit,

like you some kind
of fucking hero.

I know the truth, motherfucker.

Just some junkie looking
to shake us down.

I thought long and hard

about what I'd do to you
if I ever saw you again.

At first, I wanted
to put a bullet

right through your
fucking skull.

After a while, I realized...

I realized you saved
my life that night,

so I want to repay the favor.

Give me your wallet.

Give you my wallet?

Give it to me.

Ellis dracut. All right.

Here's how it's
going to go down.

We caught the guy that
shot your friends.

Tomorrow his lawyer's going to
get an anonymous phone call

saying that you're willing to testify.
That's bullshit.

It's not going to happen,

'cause you're not
going to be here.

Take this. Take it.

I want you buy a
ticket, train ticket.

You go to any city where
you don't know anybody.

Go someplace where you
can start a new life.

Do anything but what
you're doing here now.

You believe in
redemption, father?

Well, this path would never
have chosen me if I didn't.

So you think everyone
can be saved?

Well...

I would rather hear your
thoughts on the subject.

You know the worst
thing about homicide?

We always get there
after the fact.

You have no idea how
that eats at you.

I'm tracking a suspect.

Seems as though he's already ruined
one young girl's life and her family.

I can see the way he
was looking at 'em.

I knew exactly what
he was thinking.

This time, I'm not
going to be too late.

I'll pray for you, David.

Forensics.

It's Cal.

Got a minute to do
a search for me?

Depends what you're looking for.

Serial predator,

white male, mid to late 30s.

Sexual assaults.

Younger girls.

See if we've got
any cases reported

over the past six months.

That's all I've got to go on?

Drawings.
Come again?

He's doing drawings of them.

That's how he's getting
them to drop their guard,

by sketching the victims' faces.

Okay. Tell you what I find.

Thanks.

What's up, lieu?

At the bar, and I'll
see you inside.

We'll finish this off
today, all right?

Hey, lieu, what couldn't
you tell me on the phone?

Inside.

Perp's name is oleg emelyaenko.

Know him?

No.

I want you to see this.

Is this her place?

No, the apartment belongs to
the suspect... emelyaenko.

Come here a second.

Thing is, Cal,

she was killed attempting
to make a phone call.

The card in her hand was yours,

so, I mean, you did know her,

anyway, didn't you?

Yeah, I knew her, lieu.
Right.

Yeah. Looks like she
burnt the toast, right?

So you think this is real
funny, huh, scanlon?

It's all right.

Listen, he's having
a bad day, huh?

Get your job done,
detective, all right?

'Cause a whore's a whore.

Piece of work you are, huh?

What, do you have no, like,
social skills or what?

Just focus on those
fingerprints right there.

Look, I need to
get samples of...

It's between you and me.

Will you help me?

I'd like to, but...

Without your daughter

to validate the contents
of this journal,

there's no case. D.A.
Won't file charges.

I am not looking for a trial.

There are just some people

the world would be
better off without.

Hey, dad.

Can I talk to you
about something?

Sure.

What's going on?

There's someone...

I'm embarrassed to tell you,
but I need your advice.

Someone who?

Someone at school.

Someone who goes to your school
or someone you saw at school?

What's the difference?

Honey, I love you,

and I'm here to protect you.

I need to know if
something happened.

I know.

Well, this someone at
school, did he hurt you?

Did somebody hurt you?
What?

Just tell me. Then I can...
What's wrong with you?

Can't you stop being a cop
for, like, five minutes?

No, I just want to know
what you're talking about.

Hey, hey, hey, hey.

â™ª Your love's a bad machine â™ª

â™ª your love's a bad machine â™ª

â™ª your love's a bad machine â™ª

â™ª and, baby, I like it â™ª

â™ª your love is killing me â™ª

Bourbon, neat.

â™ª Your love is killing me â™ª

â™ª bring out the beast in me â™ª

â™ª baby, I like it â™ª

If you'd see the way
he was watching 'em,

I knew exactly what
he was thinking.

There are just some people

the world would be
better off without.

Can I get another one?

Start a tab.

â™ª Love is a bad machine â™ª

â™ª and I like it â™ª

â™ª your love is killing me â™ª

â™ª your love is killing me â™ª

â™ª bring out the beast in me. â™ª

There's someone...

Someone at school.

Hey!

What the fuck?

Zhanna dronov,

you remember her?

Yeah.

Yeah, wha...

Don't fucking move.

Whoa. Hold on, man.

Hold on a second.

Get on your knees.

So you still don't
know, do you?

Get on your fucking knees now.

Okay, man. Okay. All right.

I know who you are.

You and me, we're a lot alike.

You're a sick fuck.

Let me just show
something to you, okay?

I just want to show
you something, okay?

Nah, this is over, man.

Trust me. Let me reach
into my pocket,

and let me ju...
It's over now.

I'm just going to reach
into my pocket, man.

There's someone...

Someone at school.

Just going to reach in
my fucking pocket, man.

Don't let... let...

Hello.
Sergei.

Who is this?

Did you know he was a cop?

Who was a cop? Who
the hell is this?

I'm in front of your
fucking house, man.

Listen, asshole, I'm
about to call the cops,

so you'd better get
the hell out of here.

Hey, lieu. You called for me?

Yeah, I did, hour
and a half ago.

Guess you been occupied.

So what's going on?
Captain wants to see you.

Making my life miserable.

The prodigal has returned.

Why don't you grab yourself a
cup of coffee, lieutenant?

Oh, I think it might
be useful if I...

Give me 10 with him alone.

Sit down.

Hey, captain.

His name was Nicholas logue,

shot and killed outside
his apartment last night.

Did you know him?

No.

Nah.

Are you sure?

Well, yeah. How
would I know him?

'Cause he was one of ours,

worked out of the 77th.

Mint?

Thanks.

How you feeling?

I'm all right.

'Cause I was thinking

of having you run
primary on this.

Are you? Why me?

Our boy here may
have been involved

in some embarrassing
extracurricular activities.

And if anyone
understands the concept

of discretion being the
better part of valor,

that would be you,

wouldn't it, detective?

Okay, cap.

Hey, Callahan.
Yeah?

You might need these.

So you're going to hand off

everything you got to
him, you understand?

Yeah.
With no bullshit, right?

Remember to come up on it...
What are you looking at?

What the fuck you laughing at?
All right.

Listen to me.
I got it.

I know you got it, but don't fuck
around on this. You hear me?

Hey, sluggo.
Yeah.

I'm not kidding.
All right.

You know, you look
like shit, Callahan.

That's a slain officer
in there, huh?

You might want to think

about cleaning up
before you go inside.

Why don't you just
back off, scanlon?

I'm in no mood for
you right now.

You really just pulled the rug

right out underneath
me on this one.

What the fuck are
you talking about?

The lieutenant, he
assigns me the case.

I find out this morning I'm
supposed to report to you.

No, it was the captain's call.

Fucking idiot.

Yeah, I can still smell
his balls on your breath.

What the fuck?
Fuck you!

Piece of shit, you...
Scanlon.

Get off!
You going to do this here?

Back off, both of you.
We're not done, Callahan.

God damn it. What the
hell is wrong with you?

And look where you are, for
Christ's sake, you morons.

What are you, in third grade?

Yeah, grow up.
Talk to him, lieu.

Get out of here.
Fucking idiot.

You got to get your
shit in order.

You hear me? You going
to take this thing over,

be prepared for the fact,
you walk in that room,

people are gonna look to you for answers.
You got 'em? Huh?

Yeah.

All right.

We found a 9mm

with the serial numbers
filed off near the body.

Brogan's running it
through ballistics now.

Did you know logue, lieu?

No, I didn't.

Scanlon talked to
some of the guys

over at the 77th. They
said that he was having

emotional problems. Ah, yeah,
he was drinking too much.

Wife kicked him out, filed
a restraining order.

Familiar stuff.

All right, come on.

I'm good.
Go pay respects.

I'm Jake larussa.

Get going.

Mr. dronov.

Yes?
Sergei dronov?

What do you want?

I'm a detective.

I was wondering if I could have a few
moments to talk about your daughter.

Around back. I don't
want to upset my wife.

So why are you interested
in my daughter?

It's a routine follow-up.

Just want to make sure
the original officers

did a thorough investigation.

I don't know what they
could have missed.

Zhanna overdosed.

What? It wasn't a suicide?

I guess if you shoot
junk into your arms,

you can't be a
very happy person.

But I didn't think she
intended to take her life.

You ever seen this man?

Yeah. I met him.

Zhanna brought him by.

I thought all the men
in her life are losers,

but she said he was different.

They were going to
get clean together.

They met at the club.

I didn't like it,

but I guess it was a better
way to support her habit

than selling her
body on the street.

Do you know if zhanna
kept a journal?

She did.

I was the one that cleaned
out her apartment, but...

I never found it.

I made my peace with God.

There are some things in
this world that a father...

Should never know.

Well, I'm sorry for
the intrusion.

I thank you for your help.

Hey, brogan.

Hey.

If you're here to check

on that search you initiated,
it didn't turn up anything,

but I'd broaden the parameters
if I had more to go on.

Ah, forget that now. I need
this dusted for prints.

Does this have anything to
do with Nicholas logue?

It might.

This thing's not even bagged.

Yeah, I know.

Paper's way too porous.

Maybe I can pull something
from the cover.

Well, just give it a try, okay?

Okay.

Got a computer I can
use in here, or...

Yeah, over there.

Put your hands where
I can see 'em now.

Hey!

You listening to me?

Hi.

Is your mother home?
Who are you?

Detective Callahan.

Mom. A cop is here.

Come in.

Hello, Mrs. logue.

I'm detective David Callahan.

I'm very sorry for your loss.

I didn't want to be
here to disturb you.

Your husband's car was
involved in an accident.

I was wondering if you know
if he loaned it to someone.

You look younger in person.

I'm sorry?

Come with me.

We were fine until he
became obsessed with you.

How's the family?

My wife would be happier

if I got out of the 77th.

I can make a few calls.

Well, isn't that why I'm here?

I heard an unpleasant rumor
about one of my men.

I need someone
outside the division

to get confirmation for me.

This off the books?

It is until I can figure out
the extent of the situation.

So this is my shot, verona?

Could be.

Sorry about that, officer.
I just got the car.

I ain't used to the power.

You wouldn't happen
to have any drugs

or alcohol in here
now, would you?

No, sir, officer.
No?

We just want to
go home, officer.

I said step out of the vehicle now.
Get out.

Hey, what are you doing?

Hey!

Fuck!

Man, pull off, man. Come on.

Hey!

Verona.
Hey, they shot him.

They shot him.
Whoa, whoa, hey.

Take a deep breath
and slow down.

What happened?

Detective Callahan's been shot.
Somebody fucking shot him.

Jesus. Were you able
to get a look at them?

I barely had time to react.

Where are they?
They drove off.

I couldn't get a
plate or anything.

I wasn't expecting them
to shoot him. I...

Nick. Nick. Is detective
Callahan dead?

I don't know if he's
going to make it.

He's in pretty bad shape.

Can you contain it?
Contain what?

This department doesn't deserve
to pay for his transgressions,

so I'll ask you again.
Can you contain it?

Sure. Yes. Yes, I
can contain it.

Good. Now you do it
as fast as you can

and get the hell out of there.

Officer's been shot at the...

At the corner of
water and frontage.

Repeat, officer down at the
corner of water and frontage.

Copy that. All units,

we have a 10-0-0.

We have a 10-0-0 at the
corner of water and frontage.

Just tell my wife...

Just tell her I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Ah, you can tell her
yourself, okay?

You hear those sirens?

They're coming after
you, okay, buddy?

You're going to be fine, okay?

You just hold on, buddy.
Hold on.

Hey, what the fuck is this?

Well, it seems
self-explanatory.

It's a party to welcome
detective David Callahan

back to active duty.
I'm close.

I've spent three months
building a rock-solid case.

I'm telling you this piece of shit
belongs in northern correctional,

not a reception at the
park Plaza hotel.

You have seen this,
haven't you?

Oh, you got to be shitting me.

Now you listen to me.

The approval rating for this
department is at a 20-year high,

and there is no way...
Verona...

You, me, anybody is going
to jeopardize that.

Callahan is as bad as
they come, verona.

If glorifying him is
good for the rest of us,

is that such a bad thing?

What about royce Walker?

He's the worst trafficker
outside of New York City.

What happens if we walk
away from this thing?

He gets a free pass.
You know what, Nick?

I don't think you
can see this now,

but honestly this is the
best solution available.

Okay?
What about me?

Huh? What about my family?

Suck it up. Be a man.
Be a marine.

Fuck you.
You fucking come back here.

Get your fucking ass here,

and you understand
this simple concept.

Before you start engaging
in stinking thinking,

just remember this.

If I go down, you will be
the one to break my fall

and then fuck your family.

See you at the party.

Royce Walker.
I know you?

No, you don't know me,

but I know you.

Take it.

There's plenty more
where that came from.

What the fuck do you want?

How much money you
want to spend?

So what do you think?

Scottsdale? I don't even
know where that is.

Nobody else does either.

I can't afford this.

Walker will never let me go.

Let me worry about him.

All right?

Zhanna.

Zhanna.

Ah, no.

God damn it!

No. No.

Baby, no.

I owned her just
like I own you.

He's a regular

just like you used to be.

Pull the strings and
watch them dance.

He's in my house right now.

Should ask for
lieutenant larussa.

You tell him everything
he needs is downstairs.

Lieutenant.

You're not going
to believe this.

Eh, probably not. You can try.

So I couldn't get a
clean print off the gun

we found next to logue's body,
but I was able to pull a latent

off of one of the
shells inside the clip.

So now tell me
you got a match.

Better. We've already
got this guy in lockup.

You're right.

I don't believe you.

Told you.

I've done a terrible thing.

There's no going back.

That's why today is
the day that I die.

But I'm going to
make it right...

So I'm not going alone.

What are you doing?

Uh...

I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry, Alex.

I never meant to
hurt you or lanie.

You got to believe me.

Why are you saying that?

I love you both
with all my heart.

Whatever happens to me...

You tell her that, okay?

Okay?

Hey, brogan.

Callahan, found a couple matches
on that journal you dropped off.

We had to fume it,
but besides yours,

we found one belonging
to royce Walker.

I know.

Thanks.

Who's got your piece, oleg?

I don't own one.

Oh.
I do not believe in violence.

I doubt your girlfriend
would agree with that.

All right, listen to
me very carefully,

you fucking douche bag.

A cop was shot last night,
and your gun was involved.

A cop?

I guess somewhere a Saint
just got his wings.

Oh, whoa, whoa.
That's all you got?

No, no, no. He's got a
lot more than that.

So maybe it's time you
stopped cracking wise

and answered the question.

You don't get it. You get
three hots and a cot

for doing your old lady.
That's easy time.

But for killing a cop...

How the fuck could I kill
a cop while I'm here?

Think about it.

Oleg, let me teach
you a new word.

"Conspiracy."

"Conspiritzia."

That's close enough.

Doesn't matter if you
pulled the trigger,

just so you knew what the
gun was being used for,

so let's try again.
Where's your gun?

Where's your gun?

Where's your fucking gun?!

Captain.

I'll take it from here.

Sure. We'd like to sit in.

That won't be necessary.

Go, go.

Was I unclear, lieutenant?

Fucking commie.

You know what a
risk-benefit ratio is?

Do you know what that means?

It's like a negotiation.

And do I have the deal
of a lifetime for you.

Good.

Dispatch, this is
five-Lincoln-12.

Go ahead, five-Lincoln-12. Over.

I'm at 1175 fulton.

Shots fired. Officer down.

All patrols, respond.

We have a 10-0-0 at 1175 fulton.

Immediate backup.

Hey, Walker!

You had to get rid
of logue, huh?

Why me?

Why did it have to be me?

I remember watching you on TV

begging your savior
to come forward

so you could thank
him in person.

It was touching.

Then I started to wonder.

What if that journal had
a different ending?

What would happen if your savior
came back into your life...

And you had the
chance to repay him?

How far would you go, Cal?

Pull the strings.

Watch them dance.

Okay. Okay, that's good.

Take a hike.

Thank you.

Maybe I should get
a lawyer present.

I have a sworn affidavit
here from oleg emelyanenko.

It states that royce Walker

found out logue was
an undercover officer

and ordered a hit on him.

You discovered this information

in the course of
your investigation,

and when you went
to confront Walker,

he and his men reacted in a
life-threatening manner.

You had no choice

but to use deadly and
justifiable force.

And the rest just gets
swept under the rug,

right, captain?

No one cares.

I care.

Just sign it

like you did before.

Not this time.

I will never grasp...

The extent of your ingratitude.

You know, you talk about

protecting the integrity
of the department.

The only thing you've ever
concerned yourself with

is covering your own ass.

Don't you turn your back on me,
you self-righteous little prick.

You keep your mouth shut,

or I will fucking
bury you, Callahan.

You hear me?!

People talk about fate...

How everything happens
for a reason.

But I never believed that.

I disrespected the
woman that I love.

I violated my oath to
protect and serve.

I couldn't find a single reason
why I deserve a second chance.

Until now.

Let's go home.
