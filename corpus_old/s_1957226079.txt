Hey, how you doing big guy?

We there yet. Why are we spending Halloween
in the middle of nowhere?

I never gonna get laid out here.

First, you're the only man
alive, who didn't get laid at Mardi.

Gras. What makes Halloween so different.

He gets to wear a mask for qnet.

This trip isn't about getting late, it's
about Halloween.

We're going to take a little trip over to
the dark side a little bit.

It's not about getting late.

Everything is about getting late.

Yeah, well with your skill in that
department, I can see why it's a concern.

I got something for you.

You remember these? Well the image of you two
having sex is truly a frightening thought I

got other things planned for tomorrow.

I don't know what you've got.
Planned money, but I'm intrigued.

I picked out a killer cost people started
wearing costumes on Halloween to hide the

people that was the one night of the year.

When spirits walk the earth,

Thank you. Michael Myers wasn't Halloween a
festival.

That was celebrated by The Druids.

It was called, Sammy Hagar's.

It is Life on Mars.

Don't listen to him. We said you've been
reading up on it.

Now I saw a special on the screen.

Famous by the handiwork of the highwomen, the
what, you know, the serial killer never, got

caught Target Long motorists.

Run them off the road. He torture them until
they revealed their deepest, fears, guys,

just a warning.

This is not a conversation.

Most of the locals will appreciate two
uncles in particular.

I can't wait to meet.

Oh Michael.

Oh my God. Oh my God, it's so good to see
you.

Oh, my everyone.

This is my grandmother. You can call her
mom's.

We're sure John, oh, it's inside to the
right actually.

It's to the left, you know, the extra work.

Builds character.

These are my best friends Jennifer.

Market got bladder problems, Chris and this
is Peck.

Well, I'm glad to meet you all and I made up
the extra bedrooms, but I'm afraid a couple

of going to have to share.

Do I have any volunteers?

Well, actually maybe a
pagan I could it mean if

Oh, I'm so happy to meet you.

My dear, how long have you known each other
for and a half years four and a half years

and no ring.

Well you stick with me.

Kid will Nick Michael tie that knot?

Well, it's enough that talk.

Where's grandfather grandfather's hiding
inside?

Now I expected to more of your friends.

Mention Trisha coming in the room.

Well, then, why don't you just go in and
wash up before bed?

I'll follow afterwards.

Come on. Where does it go?

Wonderful. Oh,

Oh, careful. That's that's hopefully there's
no such thing as women's work on this Farm.

Heavy

And I've put you in your old room tank.

Seems like such a nice feeling.

Like a, what is it?

A house girl is he around?

Yeah, let's see some, he's upstairs in his
place.

How is he, Michael?

He's really looking forward to seeing you.

All right. I'll go check on them.

Michael go up and see him.

He's expecting you. Aren't you forgetting
someone?

I should thank you greet. Your Ken me for
the hired.

Help course.

My grandfather.

What's so important about seeing Crow
tonight?

It's nothing. If young people are always
doing nothing is a claim to be there,

wouldn't be any need for parents would do.

What is it, boy, just
want to see him again.

It's all let sleeping, dogs lie.

Don't worry, Michael. I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

It's good to see Crow.

It's good to see you. So,

is it?

I really think it'll work.

Are you friends ready? Yeah, well, they're
here at the costumes.

So what have you told him?

That's it. If your friends are true and you
are prepared to face your fears, the ceremony

will cleanse you. And as leader of the
ceremony, you must wear this.

What is it? The death mask.

Looks like his, you must see through his
eyes, breathe through his nose, and speak

through his mouth, then you will enter the
dream state.

It is there. You must overcome your fear.

So, what's that? Ravens.

We, as long as I told him where is it?

The evils hell. Until we banish it forever
evil.

We're cool.

This thing part of Halloween extravaganza.

Well, it was supposed to be a surprise.

It's not a very nice surprise.

This is my old friend Crow.

Ugly sucker. Morty was carved by my ancestors
many generations ago to help ward off the

advances of the white, man.

I guess it didn't work. It's been 60 years
working as a mannequin in the men's shop.

Some believe is a vessel of evil spirits.

Others think that he's just a dummy.

He's been around for as long as I can
remember.

Morty. It's part of Mike's family.

He has become the totem of his ancestors.

And his descendants to be.

Morty is a name chosen by Mike's, father.

Morty crests.

It's getting old moldy.

Hey, it's Mitch. It's about time.

All right. I love you.

Come on, Grandpa. Oh, you're here.

Okay Mike spell it spell work.

Hey you said you tell us what you have in
store for Halloween once everyone's here?

Well everyone's here.

I for one would like to know why I
practically killed myself shopping for this

costume, okay? For tonight Halloween night,
we are going to perform an ancient ceremony.

One that crows people have been performing
for Generations as with the Monte right

Morty. Excuse me.

Oh, now you just relax, you know, you
haven't had any fun since Reagan was governor

table will clear itself.

It doesn't sound like fun to me.

He might be right. What are the details?

Okay, the most important part of the ceremony
involves the fear Circle, and that's us.

Cool. Yes, he see in the ancient tradition,
the participants of the ceremony must

masquerade is Our Own Worst fears.

That's why I asked each of you guys to, to
explore that side of your nature, find that

beer and create a costume that represents.

It always, sounds so exciting.

I know exactly the costume that I'm going to
wear and grandfather will come as a rodent.

And if all goes right at the end of the
ceremony, all our fears will be banished

forever banished forever, huh?

Well than I'm gonna be here,
I'm going to be a big pussy sit.

I'll be a fat chick with saggy tits.

So Mike, how are you dressing
up his fear of commitment?

Hey, this is serious. You guys.

The only way this is going to work, is if we
pull something from the deepest darkest part

of our soul, Otherwise, we allow the true
fear, the opportunity to destroy us.

So you all brought your costumes?

Yeah. Yeah, of course, of course.

Get everything is ready.

So tonight did that rings a bell wasn't
there, some sort of a serial killer around

here that got off on making people tell
their fears or something like that.

Grandfather. You're bleeding.

All right, I'm all right. Get away from me.

Relax. It's just a bit of blood.

I don't want it near me. Okay, we'll go in.

Guess we know what she's afraid of.

I guess you missed the, don't mention the
serial killers around the local speech.

Yeah, the only way this is going to work is
if you guys take this seriously,

He actually thinks it's going to work.

Trouble between mr. And mrs.

J crew. Sort of the tramping around.

No, nothing like that.

It's been four and a
half years, good years.

But, It still feels like we're dating.

That's not so bad. Not in the way you want.

Are you looking for a gold ring?

It's not a bad start.

But you're not sure if he's the one.

And I guess that's it.

I'm not sure and
lately, it's getting worse.

My mother wants give me two
questions to ask myself about it.

I only wish I had listened to her before I
got married twice.

These are they Number one.

Do you think he has the same ideas you do
about children and a family?

Absolutely. Number two,

This one's important.

Imagine you're 60 years old and you're going
to Robo it out in the middle of the lake and

you're having a great time doing nothing.

Is he the one sitting next to you?

Absolutely.

Okay. You know, no matter how long you been
going out, it's never too late to play hard

to get. I'm worried about him.

He's been really stressed lately and he's
been having dizzy spells.

And, I want to talk to him anyway.

Thank you.

Mike. Mike, I'm sorry about that thing.

I said at breakfast.

I know that you've been really stressed
lately but I don't know why.

And if it's about me, then we should talk.

And if it isn't about me
than we should still talk,

At least I'm trying,
could you say something?

Sorry, that wasn't funny.

It wasn't meant to be. What the
hell were you doing in that mask?

Just wanted to see what it felt like.

Michael, I need to know
what's bothering you.

Some really think there's some things you
don't know about me and my family.

Okay, you know, those dizzy spells I've
been telling you about the beginning, worse.

Let me finish. They're more than just dizzy
spells.

I've been blacking out.

Losing time.

My father had the same problem.

Do you think it cost your parents accident?

My parents didn't die in a car accident.

My father, murdered my mother and then he
hung himself, I saw the whole thing.

So I have years old. I know what you're
thinking.

Okay. Alcoholism runs in the family child.

Abuse passes on from one generation to the
next.

Am I going to be my own father son?

Michael, I wasn't thinking that at all.

That I wasn't thinking anything of
the kind, we should have been, okay?

Because that's all I can think about.

Sorry Pig. I have these dreams.

These horrible dreams.

I'm starting to lose control of them.

I just thought with this mask and you and
Crow and all my friends around me, I can face

it.

Hey. You can help me,

it killed my mother and
then he took his own life.

He's not going to have mine Michael.

You're scaring me. You don't know what
scared his pay until you wake up in the

middle of the night and seeing the things
that I've seen.

Oh no. Oh no.

Oh no. Which Peg?

She just came through. She went upstairs.

Sounds like a pig in my car.

Getting along. Pretty good.

Let's go. Listen. How was that?

Happy Halloween everybody.

One pellet tastes like shit.

Asshole. Stop me from drowning you.

Nothing. Just my brother being a moron.

Morty. You okay?

Yeah,

We

Really started to lose it.

I actually thought that he was being
attacked by.

Hey, hey,

It was a joke, not a very
good one, but just a joke.

That piece of wood did not attack Chris.

Yeah, but I might find out
and make you feel better.

His arm is damaged.

I'm sorry, your stories won't fix it.

It was a joke. This is a spiritual symbol.

As I would never joke with your crucifix or
your holy mother should not joke with morning

person Morty Lay-off Chris.

The very poor

Joe Michael that I have worked in the barn,
but I will fix the ceremony will go on as

planned tonight.

Why are you always standing up for that
little shit?

Why is it always my fault?

Because you're the one
making the demands on the fans.

Like, how can you talk to me?

You can be such an asshole.

Don't start with me.

I was that a threat? Why don't we all just
relax?

It was a stupid prank.

I'm sorry. Okay. Out of this.

We do.

Hey, somebody help.

We could treat Pichichero shit.

Oh, and you said my gymnastics classes were
a waste.

Oh.

OK, you're visiting our curtain call.

We were great

And we didn't stick to the script.

Too close to home. A look
on Chris's face, it was worth it.

I don't know,

It didn't feel right.

Please stop worrying, Mike.

You were nothing like your father.

And Chicken Crow applauding.

Listen, about the ceremony.

You having second thoughts?

Sometimes I wish you'd let me say what's on
my mind before you tell me what I'm thinking.

I'm not psychic, but I did find this in a
cemetery this morning.

This morning, I told Peg

That my father. Oh.

Yeah, I mean, she took it pretty well,
considering.

She's a good woman

And I know.

Your father was a good man.

Oh, no, my father, he was a good man and he
was a bad man.

His fears just got to be strong
and the good man was lost.

Michael, you have to do the ceremony.

You want fears before they grow to strong.

But this is just alcohol.

Yeah, well, this hunk of wood will become
your greatest fear.

And Yorkhill.

Thanks, Colonel.

What are you afraid of? Arsenis.

Handing over sniffer of. I want you to stop
telling that boy those stories we were just

talking. He's got enough to worry about
without his father's ghost hanging over.

We all have ghosts, stop those stories or
I'll stop you myself.

Your grandfather lunch is ready.

OK.

Mike. Mike.

You can't stop. Mike.

Michael, coming for you.

Fear is coming for you.

Somebody. You can't be quiet.

You scared me.

Yes. Come on,

Come on, get back to your friends.

He beat you to the punch up.

What are you talking about? OK, fine, but
she's a cutie.

I wanted to go for a swim, but I can't seem
to get the pool here to work.

Look, I can't stand the water,

So you're not going to help me unless you
want to be a third wheel with your friends.

I was like,

He went up to the attic. Yeah, he's getting
ready for tonight.

She knew when it was up to.

I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

Well, you know, you and
me, we need a little cutie shit.

You don't know where we're going.

Oh, yeah. Why wouldn't I?

OK, well, then you lead the way.

You're the man you're supposed to be better
with directions.

Well, I.

I think the house is that way.

Now. Get me out of here.

Ok, OK, I'm trying.

You know, you know, it's going
to it's going to get dark soon.

I don't want to be out here when it's dark.

You read the Bible,

You don't remember, I'm very religious.

Wow, that's a real turn on what a beautiful
girl that believes in God.

Most guys, I'm unintimidating, not me.

I'm I'm religious myself.

I, I just like to keep it to myself.

Religion and politics should be private.

You're in politics, too.

Yeah.

On you. Well, yeah, of course.

You're a lot deeper than I thought.

Thanks. You know, most people think that I'm
just a pretty face, but if you take the time,

there's a lot more to discover.

I always did think you were the prettiest
girl in school.

Yeah.

But now that. Now that I'm seeing a new side
of you, I'm realizing that, you know, even

prettier than that.

What do you mean?

I mean I mean, your your beauty comes from
deep down your intelligence, your confidence

shines through. That's what makes you
beautiful.

What about Trish?

So it's a relationship of convenience.

Well, you're right about

One thing, which.

I am smarter than I.

I know.

You've got a twitch.

Cool, pretty good for the council's speak
softly, but carry a big stick.

Sorry to break up the party, but could
someone help me down?

How did you get up there?

And, you know, I got up here just to to.

Come on, look at you.

No way, what kind of a guy are you?

Come on, come up here.

Get me.

Can you climb a tree sitting on your mom's
waiting for you?

OK. Heitz.

I got dizzy driving.

We should probably
all get into our costumes.

It's getting late. It's been a real hoot.

OK.

I'm sorry.

Oh, no, it's all right.

Who is it? It's big.

Oh, Peggy didn't know you with your red.

No plans have always scared me.

Really? Are you an evil wish?

No, I'm darkness.

I'm scared of the dark.

I always have been traves grandfather crazy,
you know, all the night lights and such.

What can I help with? Well, I'm fine with
the cooking, but, you know, you could start

setting the table. All this talk about
fears has really made me jumpy.

Thank you, dear.

Butterfingers. OK, yes,

what are you wearing, claustrophobia?

It's very clever.

I've always felt safe in small places.

Oh, uh, Boza was my favorite growing up.

I, I guess we're even after you

your Jaws,

The movie, and I haven't been in the water
since.

Good on, brother.

Oh, fear of decisions.

He's never made one.

That's not true. I decided to wear this.

Oh, that must have been a real tough one.

That hurts coming from someone wearing a
cardboard box.

Is anyone hungry?

I'm starving.

Yeah, me too.

What is that? It's stupid and so thick a
mouse could trot on it.

What's in it? I'm not selling

Chicken beaks, spider hairs.

And it's a brew, not a stew.

We're all going under the evil spell.

That's right.

My pretty ones.

And I am going to shrink your heads and go
bobbing for them just like apple.

Whoo! Look at you, fake snakeskin.

I bought it at Billy Martin's mom for such,
you know, Cristoff H.O..

Oh, Blood-Red.

You like the dress. It must have cost a
fortune.

It was free and you have to kill, I put it
on my credit card.

Well, that's not free.

Lisa and I return it when we get home.

Gotcha. Uh, I'm not afraid of anything, so
I'll be going naked tonight.

Now, I'm afraid you've
already scared me half to death.

That's lame knowledge, that's cool.

Thank you.

Well, if you're going to play along, I'll
tell everybody for you.

He's a big baby when it comes to heights.

Let's set the table well, OK.

And of course,

He's hopping in his bedroom to being the
party pooper.

Well, I

Got something to get this party

O shots and you don't make maybe I should
have a drink.

That's the spirit.

Where's Mike,

Our fearless leader?

He must be waiting to make a grand entrance
forget.

Let's eat.

Oh, don't move, Mike.

Yeah, it's me.

It's about time. And turn on the lights and
see your costume.

Not yet. I have something to say, I know
I've been acting a little weird the last

couple of days is because I've been trying
to build up the courage for this moment.

But the moment has come.

Michael.

Oh, he's afraid of formalwear, right?

All right. I was afraid of commitment, but
I'm not anymore.

All that other stuff, that's not important.

You know, it's important.

Pick. Oh, oh, one of the fuses must have
blown.

Oh, I'm so scared of the dark.

Oh, wait a minute, there's got to be a
candle here someplace.

Oh, tragic timing.

Michael, Michael, you come downstairs with
me and help me change the fuse.

All right. And in the meantime, there are
some candles and lanterns in the upstairs

closet for you all.

And we'll be back in just a minute.

Come on, Michael. I'll be waiting for you.

I'm so excited for you.

I don't want anything to go wrong for your
big day.

That makes the box throw.

Oh.

So how does he get here, Mike?

Michael, it's OK.

I took care of everything, just like I did
for your father, but this isn't where I left

the body.

All right. I used to post here.

Motive? I don't know.

So, look, consider her
out there maybe more.

He's making

Some moves. Isn't there some unfinished
business?

The reason we really came all the way up
here.

Well, hang on a sec. I mean,
Jen, we want to see this.

Isn't that her costume? Oh, probably didn't
fit in the bathroom.

Come on, Jen, finish up, get the perky ass
out here.

You hold the party.

Jennifer what's that?

That's a fucking

Stupid. But.

Mike, listen to

Yourself trying to convince us that the
spirit of your dead father's in a mannequin

trying to kill people, your father was a
serial killer.

Look, I needed you all up here to help me.

Help you what?

The whole idea of tonight's ceremony was to
put my father's spirit to rest.

I don't see any reason why we're sticking
around.

Let's get out of here. No, we have to
destroy Morty.

Mike, for once. I think he's got a point.

We should get out of here.

I understand what went wrong.

Krosa that with the townsman,
there would be nothing to fear.

And Mike Modie is a hunk of what you tell
anybody.

If we're looking for suspects, where's that
big Indian?

I haven't seen it for hours.

Crow didn't kill anyone.

How do you know, because Maudy got to him
first crows bodies in the cellar.

Well, it's not cool. And who is it

Not to be disrespectful, Mams, but the only
person not accounted for is your husband.

Oh, no.

There's one other guy
who could have done it.

And that's you, Mike. Oh, that's true.

Mike, you are with us.

Ok, believe me, OK, I
thought the same thing myself.

Look at me, there's no blood on me, huh?

How could I have done it? Blood washes off.

It was Morty who's ever responsible.

We have to leave now.

Let the police take care of it.

They can't help. She's right.

I'm leaving. Mike, we should get out of
here.

Is anybody listening to me?

We can't leave now. It'll only get worse.

I've heard enough and I'm packing up my
stuff.

Miss Maserati's in the garage.

Please, you guys, I need your help.

Sorry, we have to go now.

I'm not abandoning Mike.

I've got to deal with this.

Some friends you are, what happened to
sticking together?

This is just I want you to leave now.

Save yourselves.

There's been enough
harm done in this house.

There just can't be anymore.

Come on. Let's just get packed up and get
out of here.

Come on. I need my grandfather.

I can't leave my sister.

All right. We should stick together.

I'll come with you. Stay with Lisa.

OK. I know this must sound insane.

Mike, listen,

You've got to trust me, OK?

I know what's happening here.

I trust you. Hey, it's going to be OK,

don't worry.

I know you're scared.

I am, too.

It's like being this close to death that
just makes everything seem more alive.

What are we looking for? What do

We do when we find them?

Wait.

Yes, I do.

This is to tell us we've

Got to find more, going to
put it around his neck and

Stop. OK, that's what eases your mind and
lets go and find morning.

So, OK, you found Morti,

See, he's honeywood.

What happened?

He passed out, but it's OK now.

Matt.

Yeah, do you think?

I know. The thing you said about feeling
more alive when you're close to death.

Oh, me.

Here's the last place we saw lights went
out, just as I should finish what I started.

Not now,

Not under these circumstances.

Mike. Yes, forget about all of this,
everything that's happened today.

Now imagine that you're 60 and you're in a
boat in the middle of a lake.

Who's with you? But don't think, just
answer.

I don't know. My trusty dog, D'Aguilar.

Oh, and some

Old crap complaining about the cool.

My show starts.

That's my morning and finish this.

They to understand.

But everything.

I promise you, this is over, I do this
properly.

What the hell are you doing? We're getting
out of here.

You're coming with us. What about Mike?

Mike's a killer bag.

Come on, we got to wait for the others in
the car, not let them.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah,

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh.

Let's get the fuck out of here.

Mike. Going down.

Like, oh, is he breathing?

God. Boki.

Lisa Anta.

Mike's up here. You better come, I'll be
right there.

I just did no.

Oh, I'm so sorry,

You, Michael, would never kill anyone.

I did not do this. I find warty, so you'll
believe me, I believe you, Michael.

You should.

Michael.

It is.

No grandfather has no guns.

Michael killed Peg, the others.

It's all my fault. No, you didn't.

Yes, I did. Trying to convince myself that
it's not it's not me, but it's true.

I'm just like my father,
Michael, enough was Morty Kro.

He's the one who locked me in this, but I
hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't

have believed it. I saw you going
out to the barn trying to find me.

I saw your feet. I wanted to help you.

But Morty came out of the barn and broke it
back inside me.

I followed what he was waiting for me with
Crow's dead body.

Poor soul. It peg the others, Marty, we've
got to figure out a way to stop him

in this nightmare crusade, all in need of
these.

God have mercy on us all.

Mams refuses to come.

She says she won't leave her grandson.

We're going to get the hell out of here.
Now, wait, what about PECC?

Hold on. There she is, pick the gun.

Take your hand. Are you all right?

Yes, dear, but you're done.

Like, take off the fucking map.

I know how

You must feel, Michael. You still doubt
yourself.

I've been there to.

Given the fear.

You had to I had the urge, but I fought it
off.

Your father was a strong enough.

But I think you are.

No, I'm not.

I'm not strong enough to break this door
down by myself.

Can you help me? I'll get me up

This whole Balkan still charge
if he gets his legs under him.

Afraid of decisions, are we?

Well, here's a killer for you.

I'm going to rip out your heart or tear off
your head.

Fuck you, Marty. OK,
all of the above it is.

Scott. Not so fast, boys.

Fuck you. Is there any way to talk to.

Your father. Stephen, don't do this.

You stay out

Of the staff. Sun.

It's all right, Michael, come my.

I'm your father.

You can do it.

Joe.

And you no.

Her.

What are you, one of Morty's creations

Like, it's me are me OK, Peg's dead.

No, it's me. Please believe me.

I promise. Now you're in the attic.

I looked everywhere for you, but not in the
attic.

Did you come any
closer? One of you is Morty.

How can I convince you I'm not Maudy?

Ok, you're 60,

You're in a rowboat in the middle of the
lake, who's with you?

I trusted Doug Yeller and some old
crab who's complaining about the cold.

Not that. Oh, Michael.

Everything's going to be OK.

I'm going to be at time.

Come on, come on, one.

Walk out of here.

Yeah. Decisions.

Fucking bastard.

Yeah.

Michael, you will become me, it's your
nature, I'm not your son, but your fear,

we're not my father.

Maybe it's time for another blackout or
maybe we should keep you awake this time.

Might be a little more terrifying.

I am not sure how.

Michael, you should be quiet.

You know what's going to happen.

He could put up.

It's going to blow things up.

No, because I can't do it,

Cut my arm off because I get

Done.

Chris. OK.

I can see the fear in your eyes.

Were you afraid of getting her Turbit's?

Where is it fire? I made a clear cut your
ass.

They kill them.

Where's that water

Go, let's go, let's go.

Is it over, it's over.

You know what, I'm not afraid of the water
anymore.

Please, let's get out of here.

Yeah, let's go. What are we gonna tell the
police?

Tell them the truth? Something attacked us.

You mean somebody who would believe the
truth?

What exactly is the truth?

I mean, was that really your father?

He didn't commit suicide, did he?

Yes. He did with the Indians say it's
suicide, never rest, it's over now, it's

finished.

I thought I knew this.

He did. You don't anymore.
