Over there! Look!

Dwight?

Dwight, don't. Don't.

Hey, asshole!

What are ya, nuts?
The cap's not orange enough for ya?

Get out of these woods!

I got a right to hunt here.
I got a permit.

If the guy's got a permit...

Jesus.
Get out!

Let's go.

That's Dwight Armstrong,
my stepfather...

accent on "step."

He's a lawyer by profession...

but spends most of his time as head
of the Friends of Fish and Wildlife...

an extremist pro-mammal group
here in Vermont.

Almost all of its members,
male and female, look just like Dwight.

My real dad died in a motorcycle wreck
when I was six.

Two years later, Mom hooked up
with Mr. Personality here.

It has not been a barrel of laughs.

There was a certain poignancy,
though, about today's hunting party.

It was my last evening at home.

Tomorrow I was off to New York
to begin my first year...

at New York University Film School.

A freshman.
That was me.

My farewell dinner was a typically
raucous and hilarious affair...

full of warm, good feelings.

That should cover it.

Afterwards, Dwight gave me $600
in spending money...

Thank you.
And extended a hearty handshake.

Where's the subway, please?
That'd be downstairs.

That way?
Right.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Sorry.

Forget about it.
He's out like a light.

It's the shame of the cities.

Are you all right? Nothing broken?
I'm okay.

That was some nasty spill you took.
I'm okay.

You sure?

Can I give you a hand
with those bags?

No, thanks.
I'm fine.

You're a smart kid.

Rule number one:

Don't let anybody touch your bags
unless you know that person...

and can verify
that he's been bonded.

Great. Thanks a lot.
I happen to be bonded...

which is your good fortune.

Ignore her.
Get away from me!

"Who's this stranger?"
You're asking yourself.

It's Victor Ray, general manager
of the Victor Ray Car Service.

You're on your way to college?

Yeah. New York University.
Good school.

Thanks. I thought I knew where
the subway was. Do you know?

Yeah, but you don't want the subway.
Yes, I do. I want the subway.

Okay. It's over there.
Thanks.

Let's go!

Kid, in New York, we have
three distinct social classes.

A: People who make
a billion dollars a day...

and get laid in some tower
every night.

B: People who live in Times Square and
eat Yankee Doodles on the sidewalk.

And C: Guys like me,
the glue of society.

We go, forget about it.
All hell's gonna break loose.

You mean rich against poor.
We're on the brink. It's seething.

Come with your Uncle Vic.

For $65 you get an air-conditioned ride
and total peace of mind.

I can't afford that.

That's the new rate. I could take you
for the old rate, which is 50.

It's outta my league.

How much can you go for?

Go for? I don't know.
Say 40, which for me is charity.

It's impossible. No.
Ten dollars I can manage.

Ten dollars?

For complete delivery and security
in a mint-condition Bonneville?

I gotta eat too!
I can't do better.

It's okay. Listen...

I'll walk or take a bus.

All right, ten bucks.

Come on. I'll take you for ten bucks,
but on one condition.

Promise you won't tell anybody
I took you for ten.

Word gets out, I'm finished.
I won't tell a soul.

Okay. Follow me.

I'm parked down the street
in a reserved spot.

Let's go.

Watch out!
Jesus!

Watch out!
Suicide attempt, right?

It's bigger than I had imagined.

That's true of many things in Manhattan.
The other boroughs too.

Don't get me wrong.
There's tremendous things in Queens.

Go to the trunk, kid. It opens
electronically from the inside.

Take everything. You'd be surprised how
many people, excited to be in New York...

Hey! Whoa!

Stop! Stop the car! Stop!

Stop the car, please!

I had been in New York for 19 minutes
and 11 seconds...

and I was already ruined.

Action.

The roommate enters.

Come on in. Come on.
Don't be afraid.

That's it. Come right in.

I'm holding you
in what we call a medium shot.

A really lovely shot. Very cinematic.
Listen my name is...

A little confused.

I like it.
It sells.

You think in front of the camera.
Very good. I like that in my actors.

I'm moving in now.
Hi. Is this the right room?

Cut.

That's a wrap.
Check it, kids.

Kellogg?
Yeah. You're?

Steve Bushak.

How do you do?
Really nice to meet you.

I should go
to the police now.

Clark, Kojak is a fictional character.

Don't involve the police.
I'm just a victim.

Clark, everybody in this city
is a victim.

Welcome to New York.

Well...

I'm deeply moved.

Sir, I understand your position.
I'm just...

You cannot function
in Introduction to Film...

without owning
Fleeber's Viewpoints in Cinema...

and Selected Readings
in Cinema by...

Fleeber.

I know. Those are your books.
I want to buy them...

They're not to be thought of
as my books.

They are required
and essential reading...

as are the dozen other books
which you must own...

and which will cost you $700.

Off we're
gonna shuffle

Shuffle off to Buffalo

To Niagara in the sleeper
There's no honeymoon that's cheaper

And the wheels go slow

Off we're gonna shuffle

Shuffle off to Buffalo

I'm doing a paper entitled
And the Wheels Go Slow...

Form and Function
in 42nd Street."

Oh. That would be
a very interesting idea.

Take a musical like that...
I suggest you call home for money.

No, that won't work.
My stepfather won't help...

This is out of Dickens.

You're robbed by a street urchin.
You have a wicked stepfather.

I don't know what to say.

I'm just trying to explain
that I can't get books now.

I'm your faculty advisor,
not your caseworker.

I'm only interested in your academic
career, and may I say candidly...

that you're off to an extraordinarily
unimpressive start.

Well, I'm sorry,
but being new to New York and...

Excuse me.

I have to leave now.

Excuse me.

Hey, wait up!

Stop him!
Wait!

Watch it!

Bye-bye.

I want my money
and my stuff now!

My money and my clothes,
or I call the cops.

I know who you are.
Enough with this crap!

Where's my stuff?

Upstairs. Give me a hand
with the wagon, would you?

You must be joking.

Hey, the party's over.

I victimized you in a moment
of weakness, and now justice is done.

So give me a hand.

You have my money?
Do you hear me?

Watch your step, kid.
The floors are wet.

If you don't give me
the money immediately...

I would love nothing
more than to do just that.

However...

here we run into
an awkward moment.

Tragically...

I suffer from a gambling problem.

I placed a wager on a horse.

You lost my money on a horse?
All of it?

In retrospect, I'm not sure
it actually was a horse.

Oh, God.

I swear,
it was a responsible bet.

It was a four-to-one shot.
We took a beating.

The good news is I still got
most of your clothes here.

I'm going to the police now.

Why are we talking about the police?
You're in college. I'm a working man.

This has nothing to do
with the police.

Robbery is still a crime
in New York, is it not?

It's not legal.
It depends on the circumstances.

Bullshit.

What if I got you a job?
An unbelievable opportunity.

Oh, yeah.
You're just the guy.

I'm serious.
In fact...

No, no.
Forget about it.

What?

It's irresponsible of me.
So much money.

What is it?

I shouldn't even
offer you this job...

but you put me
in such an awkward position...

between my terrible
feelings of guilt towards you...

and my family obligations.

I don't know
what you're talking about.

I'm talking about offering you a job
that I promised to my sister's kid.

It'd be perfect for a college student.
Flexible hours. Big money.

My sister's gonna kill me.
She's gonna blow my brains out.

What kind of work is it?
Stealing cars?

Hey, if you're gonna be
a cynic here...

You expect me to trust you after you
drive away with everything I own?

You don't have to do anything.

I'm just giving you a choice is all.

But if you want to make
some serious money...

be at this address
tomorrow afternoon at 2:00.

120 Hester Street.
Old World Social Club."

Yeah. You'll be working
for my uncle Carmine. A great man.

He's the smart one
in the family.

Hey, look who's here.
Don't be shy, Clark. Come right in.

I wasn't sure
if this was the place.

This is it.
The best neighborhood in New York.

My uncle Carmine's waiting for you.
Here we go.

Over there at the desk.
That's him.

He's your uncle?
Yeah. Look, do me a favor.

Don't say anything
about my gambling...

or I'll catch a beating.

I said, How are you doing?"

Very well," he says.
Hello there.

Lorenzo, this is my good friend Clark
from Kansas.

Vermont.

"My heart is filled
with much happiness...

in meeting you,"
he says.

God Almighty.

You're thinking about
the resemblance, right?

I can't believe it.
He's the real thing.

When they saw him,
they based the movie.

So is he like a Mafia guy?

No, no. Local businessman.
Importer. That's it.

What a kisser, huh?
Unbelievable.

Clark, this is my uncle,
Carmine Sabatini.

Uncle Carmine, this is Clark...

Hey, you never told me your last name.
Kellogg.

Just like the cereal.
Yeah.

Like the breakfast cereal.

Your resemblance to the Godf...
Clark, have a seat.

Pull up a chair.

Thank you.

How'd you like a nut?

No, thank you.

None for me, Uncle Carmine.

Did you ever try Italian coffee?

How would you like
to try a little taste?

Yeah. Why not?

Good.
None for me, Uncle Carmine.

Lorenzo.

Two espressos," he says.

You know, that picture
on the wall back there...

that wouldn't
by any chance be Mussolini?

It ain't Tony Bennett.

Some of the older members
of the club...

just...
I don't know...

They keep it up there
for sentiment.

Sentiment?
Yeah, you know, the old days.

For the old days.
For good or for bad.

It'd be like, for you,
I suppose...

a picture of the Beatles.

Yeah. The Beatles.

They're actually
before my time.

Well, whatever.
You understand.

Sure. It's not
for political reasons...

that you keep the picture up.

It's not political.

No, it's definitely
not political.

My nephew tells me
you're from Kansas.

Vermont.

Vermont.

Six of one, half a dozen
of the other.

You know,
the most important thing is...

we're all Americans.

That's right.
Yes, that's right.

Ah, good, Lorenzo.
Thank you.

"Thank you,' he says.
I know.

Now, this is real Italian coffee.

It's not like regular coffee.
It's...

You know what I mean?

It's a little strong, so we gotta
put a little sugar in here.

It cuts the...

It cuts the strength of it,
you know.

Maybe a little more,
that's all.

All right.
Drink it right down.

One gulp.

Puts hair on your chest.

Did my nephew
explain this job to you?

No. No, not really.

It would be best for you to explain it,
Uncle Carmine.

This is not complicated...

but it has to be done right.

You know, like all things.
Sure.

Tomorrow at 1:00 p.m.,
outside the club...

is gonna be parked a, uh, car.

What was that?
Sedan Deville.

That's a type of Cadillac.
A Cadillac?

Yeah, this is
a type of Cadillac.

Now, I want you to drive this car
to the JFK cargo terminal.

There you're going
to pick up a package...

addressed to Larry London.

You deliver this package
to Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

That's it.

How far is that?
All day?

That shouldn't take you
more than three hours...

the whole trip,
back and forth.

That depends on the traffic.

Right.
Then again, you never know.

You could breeze
out there in no time...

or you could wind up
bumper-to-bumper for three hours...

sitting with your dick
in your hand.

Anyway, that's why I need someone
who can use their head...

that's not gonna get upset, nervous...
no matter what happens.

Understand?
Right. I understand that.

For this service,
I'm gonna pay you $500.

Five hundred dollars?

Now you see why
my sister's so pissed?

I mean angry,
besides herself.

You're gonna pull in
a grand a week, at least.

$1,000 a week?
Yeah.

I'm gonna need
two trips a week, minimum.

And then, of course,
if things get busy, maybe even more.

Jesus. I hadn't thought
of that much money.

I don't know.

You don't know what?
Now, wait. Just hold on.

Let him think.
This is a sign of intelligence.

He's trying to understand
what the nature of this job is.

What are your thoughts
on this, Kent?

Clark.
Sorry. Clark.

I have to ask you something.

I dont want you
to take it wrong.

No, no, no.
Anything. Go ahead.

I smell a rat.

You smell a rat?

He smells a rat.

That's right.

You know why
you smell a rat?

Because God gave you a brain,
that's why.

Because you're asking yourself...

What is this?
A man will pay me $500 a trip...

to go pick up
a package and deliver it."

Is this what you're thinking?
That's right. That's what I'm feeling.

Well, this is natural.
Natural.

Great.
So then you understand.

Oh, sure.
I understand a thousand percent.

Give me your hand.

You know what this is?
You mean taking my hand?

We call this
the hand of friendship.

We?

Clark, you dont know
what this is...

the hand of friendship
from my uncle Carmine.

I want you to take
this opportunity.

Totally legitimate work
for $1,000 a week...

and I know you're not gonna
disappoint me.

I don't see
how I could say no.

This is not a yes.

I want to hear yes.

Yes.

Good.

That's good. Now I'm happy.
I'm so happy.

But I don't know
why I'm so happy. That's good.

Come on.

Everybody up.

I want you to come to my house
in Queens tonight.

He's gonna...
Yeah. Pick up the keys.

I'll give you directions.

You know...

I have such good feelings
about you.

I'm absolutely filled with emotion.

I never had a son.

For fifteen years, I never saw him
take to anybody like that.

Never.

Senator.

We're both part
of the same hypocrisy.

But never think
it applies to my family.

All right.

Some people have to play little games.

You play yours.

Let's say that you'll pay me because
it's in your interest to pay me.

But I want your answer
and the money by noon tomorrow.

And one more thing.

Don't you contact me again.
Ever.

From now on,
you deal with Turnbull.

Senator.

You can have my answer now
if you like.

My offer is this: Nothing.

Not even the fee
for the gaming license...

which I would appreciate
if you would put up personally.

Senator.

My offer is this: Nothing."

In that one moment, Michael Corleone
says that all corruption is equal...

that there is no separation
between politics and gangsterism.

Now, in the Fleeber treatise,
"Guns and Provolone"...

what point is made
about the similarities...

between Karl Marx's
Das Kapital...

Immanuel Kant's
Critique of Pure Reason...

and the Lake Tahoe scene
from Godfather II, Mr. Kellogg?

Sir.

You haven't read
the Fleeber piece?

Well...
You need tutoring from Mr. Bushak?

No, sir.

Perhaps Mr. Bushak would enjoy
helping you prepare...

a five-page answer
to my question...

which I want on my desk
by noon tomorrow.

Mr. Glassman.

In an evolving society...

violence and Narcissism
replace ra...

Shut up!

I hate this guy.

You're Clark.

Yes, I'm Clark.

I'm Tina, Carmine Sabatini's
only daughter.

Oh. I didn't know
that he had a daughter, only.

He does.
I'm her.

Come on in.
Thanks.

This is quite a house.
It's very European.

Can I get you something
to drink? Beer? Sprite?

Oh, no, thanks.

Jesus, look at that.

Wow. What a job they did.

Job?
Copying job. Yeah.

Down to the little cracks
and everything.

This isn't a copy.
This is it.

Right.
I'm very serious.

This has to be a copy, okay?

Do you remember
about ten years ago...

the original toured the country?

It did?
They brought it over from the Louvre.

Who?
I don't know who. They.'

It was in the United States
is my point.

And?

And it stayed here.

The one they shipped back to Paris...

the one behind
all that thick glass...

that all the tourists
take the pictures of...

that's the copy.

My dad thought
it was just awful...

such a masterpiece
behind all that thick glass.

And he had such a special feeling
for it...

his whole life.

Sort of an obsession, really.

So he ripped off the Mona Lisa?

The day it arrived here...

I was, like, nine.

My dad unwrapped it
outta this huge crate.

There was Styrofoam
and newspaper everywhere.

And suddenly,
there it was.

And he turned to me...

I'll never forget this.

And he said...

Now I'm happy, sugar.

Now I got the Mona Lisa."

It's safe here in Queens?

People don't steal things
from my father.

They don't?
No.

Mona Lisa

Men have named you

You want to dance?

Here?
Here.

It's kind of hot.
Take your sweater off.

For that Mona Lisa strangeness

In your smile

Do you smile to tempt a lover

Mona Lisa

Or is this your way

To hide a broken heart

Many dreams

Have been brought to your doorstep

So my dad tells me
you're from Nebraska.

Vermont.

So what do you think
of New York?

I stopped thinking 24 hours ago.

I'm going on pure instinct.

Well, that's what you're
supposed to do in New York.

Is your father
in the house now?

No.

He's in the Bronx
at some meeting.

Aunt Angelina.

My head's killing me.
I gotta go to bed.

Aunt Angelina, this is Clark.
Remember, Dad mentioned?

Who?
Clark, the boy working for Dad.

I'm going to bed, watch Jeopardy.
You come up, Tina?

After Clark leaves.

Good night, Aunt Angelina.

Yeah, yeah. Night.

Dad's sister.

She moved in when my mother died.
I was four.

I was six.

Your mom?
No, my dad.

But it's never the same.

No, but what can you do?

Nothing.
Nothing.

I'll get you the keys to the car.

I'm a sophomore at the College
of the Sacred Virgin.

Don't laugh. Next year
I'm switching to Harvard.

Harvard?
Jesus, that's really something.

I didn't even bother applying there
with my grades in high school.

Not that they were terrible.

My grades are nothing special...
about a B-minus.

So how did you get in?

Your boards must have been monsters.
Oh, it's Dad.

He called Harvard
and said I wanted to go...

and they said,
Oh. Sure."

Wait a minute. Are we talking
about the same Harvard?

The one that's in
Cambridge, Massachusetts?

Of course.
Harvard needs my dad, you know.

They don't want strikes
by the janitors...

or if they want the laundry done
and the gardening...

All those great
old trees and lawns.

But he's an importer.
Right?

It's great meeting you, Clark.

A guy from Vermont,
real American, New Englandy."

Hold on. He's an importer.
Just tell me.

He's an importer, yes.

An extremely powerful importer.
There are such people.

So, what is it?
What is what?

What am I picking up
at the airport?

Hint: It's pretty big.

Bring someone to help you out.
But what is it?

If Dad didn't tell you,
I can't really.

It's not going to be...

like, a dead guy in a box
or something, is it?

What an imagination!

You're so unbelievably cute.

I can't wait to see you again.
I could just eat you up.

Good luck tomorrow.

You boys need me?

Are you Leo?

I am Big Leo.
It just says Leo.

We are the same,
Leo and Big Leo.

You're synonymous.

That's right.

Okay. Come with me.
You don't bring it out?

No.
Not this I don't.

"Not this I don't."

Remember those words.
Not very encouraging.

Here it is.
All yours.

It arrived this morning
on the red-eye from Borneo.

I'm gonna puke my guts out.

What is it?
A lizard.

That thing is a lizard?

Yeah. They call it
the Komodo dragon.

Makes its home
in Indonesia, Sumatra...

Komodo Island,
in point of fact.

By the way, tell Mr. Sabatini...

this cost him an extra eight bills
to get through.

Excuse me?
Just tell him. He'II understand.

Sign here by the "X," recipient.
That's me.

That's you.
You're the recipient.

Put him in the back seat
with the windows open.

They got to have a lot of fresh air.
The gills or something.

He doesn't have any gills.

Whatever. That's what I was told.
Fresh air.

And make sure you
get a seat belt on him.

If he jumps on you...

you got major troubles.

Down boy.

It's not a dog.
Yeah. You know what?

We got to pick him up.

Pick him up.
Yeah.

With what?
With our hands. Here.

It's not that bad, you know that?

I agreed to help, but I'm not
putting my life in danger...

Help me out here.
I'm sorry, but I refuse to handle it.

I'm not trained.
He's going under the truck.

All right.

Get the door.
You locked it, genius.

Right.

Will you take him?
Just take him for a second.

You're the recipient.

Hurry. If he stains me,
I'm gonna be pissed.

Could you take
any longer with this?

Okay. All right.

Okay, now, you go around
and get in the other side.

Major trouble.

We got to put
the seat belt on him.

You're joking.
No, I am not joking.

This is obviously precious cargo,
this freaking thing.

Come on.

Whoa, whoa. What seat belt?
Put him in this one.

Okay. Got it.
Seat belt.

Get this under his armpit.

What armpit?
This is a lizard armpit. Put it in.

That lizard armpit.
I see. I didn't realize.

You know...

I think he's okay.
Let's go.

Happy as a clam.

I'm dying. Close the window.
Turn on the air conditioner.

He said to leave them open.
Who? Haystack Calhoun?

What is he, a zoologist?
I'll take full responsibility.

All right.

I told you he'd throw up.

My apologies.
I got to open the window. The stench!

It's murder.

Feeling better?
Tummy ache all gone?

God, it stinks in here.
I can't stand it.

We got to wash it out.
Pull over.

All right.

Excuse me.
Hello?

I need some water.
A hose.

Around the corner.
Help yourself.

Thanks.
It's this way.

It's around the back.

He went under a car.

You go that way.

Will the owner of the reptile
please report to the information booth.

Will the owner of the reptile...

Don't panic.
What if I can't find him?

Look. Leave the country.
Five, ten years, you come back.

You're kidding?
I'm serious!

Security to Concourse B.

Security to Concourse B immediately.

Okay. Go.

Will the owner of the reptile
report to information.

Slowly.

I'm losing him.

Hey. Hold it. Yes.

I'm really afraid now.

Mr. London?

Edward?

Oh, look!

It's here.
Finally.

Are you Edward?

I am.
Oh, what a beautiful specimen!

Has this bad boy been swimming?

Gee. We wouldn't know.
We came right from the airport.

They just love swimming pools.

But... chlorine.

I told him
he is very disobedient dragon.

For joke.

It's a good joke.
It's very unusual.

Well, without humor,
what do we have?

Beautiful, yes?

This is like a zoo?

This is like a zoo.

Can you believe this?

So do you, like,
exhibit rare animals?

On occasion.

Who are these boys?

Carmine said one boy.
Here are two.

Young men,
this is Mr. Larry London.

Mr. London,
I'm Clark Kellogg.

Carmine said one boy.
Here are two.

Well, I realize that, sir.
Yes, we are two boys.

As you quite rightly point out.

However, since I'm
somewhat new to the area...

and this parcel...
this particular parcel was quite bulky.

So at the suggestion of Tina...

The beautiful Tina.

Yes, the beautiful Tina.

Again, sir, if there was any
misunderstanding, I apologize.

Carmine said one boy,
and here are two.

Ya gotta like this guy.

Smells like basil.

Very good.

A cream basil sauce.

So you're actually a chef.

I wasn't clear what you did.

And now you'll get your money.

The money...

The money is conveyed...

in a brown paper bag.

Not very attractive, I know.

That's fine, sir.

If it is in your nature to count it,
I will not be offended.

That won't be necessary.

I certainly trust you
and Mr. Sabatini.

That means
my heart swims in blood."

I believe that's a Bengal tiger,
ladies and gentlemen.

Something is way off.
Way off.

How are you, darling?
How's New York?

Oh, well, I miss you too,
like crazy.

At the risk of sounding like,
you know, a mother.

No, he's asleep,
thank God. Why?

Well, the thing is,
I got this job.

Will you listen?
New York is unbelievably expensive.
