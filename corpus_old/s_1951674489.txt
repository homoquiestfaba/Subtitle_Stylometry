(MAN'S VOICE) <i>You want to know</i>
<i>all about me, don't you?</i>

<i>Well, let's see, now...</i>

<i>The first time I was in love</i>
<i>was June 1975, in Boca Raton.</i>

<i>Her name was Coty Pierce.</i>

<i>She lived there with her parents</i>
<i>and her little sister, Karrie.</i>

<i>And I loved her, too. I loved them both,</i>
<i>and they were in love with me.</i>

<i>They just didn't know it.</i>
<i>No one did.</i>

<i>I lived with them all that June.</i>


(MAN'S VOICE RESUMES)
<i>I lived in the attic. I was watching.</i>

<i>I loved the expression on their faces</i>
<i>when they slept.</i>

<i>And then I decided to declare myself</i>

<i>and show them</i>
<i>how much they loved me.</i>

<i>What happened?</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

<i>Coty was honoured.</i>

<i>She kissed me back.</i>
<i>And then Karrie...</i>

<i>And finally that night,</i>

<i>I kissed their mother, too.</i>

<i>Just a little pinprick. There.</i>

<i>Kiss me.</i>

That's it. Are you watching this?

Good. Stand back!

This game is 80% winning and
20% talent. You've got to keep running.

That's it, that's my boy.

Good. Bring an uppercut.
Right hand.

Don't fall on your face
because you missed that jab.

What do I always say? Power comes
from leverage and technique.

Are you paying attention?


I've got to go. Pair off and hit
the heavy bag. Three rounds each.

How long has she been inside?
I'm on my way.

Their names are Edmund and Dianne
Wainford, ages 48 and 42.

An item about seven years,
no complaints.

The neighbours say they were
divorced, married, separated,

reconciled, his idea, her idea,
no one has a clue.

All I know is that's Edmund,
and Dianne's in the bedroom.

Whose gun?

He had a.38
Smith and Wesson registered.

Does that look like a.38 to you?

Do you want a vest?

I don't think I'll need one.

Dianne?

This is Alex Cross, DCPD.
I need to talk to you. OK?

Dianne, I'm going
to open the door, all right?

I'm going to open it now.

Hold it.

Please. Please, Dianne.

I'm going to close this door.

I'm going to move this chair
to block the door.

That way nobody comes in and
this stays between me and you. OK?

Can you take the gun
out of your mouth, please?

It's just as effective
if you put it to your temple.

It just makes it easier to talk.

What sort of policeman are you?
I'm a forensic psychologist.

I'm a guy who walks into a room
and determines the hows and whys.

Then you don't need to hear from me.
No, I don't.

But I need you
to confirm a couple of things.

For instance, did Edmond
often beat you after he drank?

And the turtleneck you're wearing,
is that to hide bruises?

Do you often have to hide marks
that he put on you?

Two weeks ago, he hit me.

And I swore it was the last time.

I finally get the nerve
to leave that son of a bitch

and then he suckers me back.

You know what I think?
That you did what you had to do.

The thing now
is to figure out how to finish things off.

The right way! The right way!

Is it all right if I come a little closer?

Thanks.

We only have
to get photographs of your bruises.

I know at least
half a dozen top notch lawyers

that specialise
in battered women's defences.

The point is, Dianne,

if you pull the trigger,
no one will ever know the truth.

Can I have it?

Dianne?

Samp, what are you doing here?
Doughnut raid?

Alex... hold on.

Look, May's inside.
Yeah?

We got a call from Durham today.
Durham?

Naomi is missing. Come on.
What do you mean, "missing"?

They called May from the law school.
She called me. I called them back.

I told them who you were, her uncle.

They said she's been missing
for four days.

Four days!
The Durham Police is on it now.

The guy I talked to sounded solid.
Don't talk to him, talk to me.

They stole my child!
Now, May, take it easy.

We'll handle it together, but with your
high blood pressure, I need you to relax.

But what if?
Now, you just take it easy.

Relax and breathe.
I want to tell you something.

Remember when Naomi
was about ten, she got lost?

You got frantic because you thought
we'd never find her.

You were worried
she'd have an asthma attack.

It turned out she was just fine.

Well, everything will be fine now,
because I'll handle this myself.

You know you can trust me.
I'll handle this.

I trust you.

Nana is going to take you up to
Janell's room. Just relax for a while.

I don't need to relax.
May... May...

Yeah.

Good. All right.

I'll have to go down there.
Listen, Alex. Stay here.

If they've a chance to wrap it up, how
long will they hunt for one lost black girl?

Stay here. I'll go down there. You can't
do anything, it's out of yourjurisdiction.

You don't understand. I've got to go.

Please, talk to me.

Talk to me the way you used to.
Please, say something.

Please! I'm sorry.

I can be better. I can be good.

I won't be bad any more.
Yeah?

Yeah.

Please, I swear.

You promise?
Yes. I'll make you happy.

How?

Let me show you.

Tell me you love me.

Tell me you love me!

I love you.
Megan, I don't believe you.

I love you.
Of course you do.

Good afternoon, Sergeant.
Dr Alex Cross, Washington DC PD.

I would like to see Chief Hatfield.
He's tied up at the moment.

We'll tell him. He'll be with you
as soon as possible. Take a load off.

Thank you.

Sign this, sir.
Dr Cross.

You've been waiting for a while.
About two hours.

We've got a laid-back way here.
I see.

Run the names through the print-out.
I'm sorry about the wait.

Nick Ruskin.

Davey Sikes.

It's been real busy round here.

We've had a homicide,
and not your garden variety, either.

Meaning?
That's all I know.

We are heading out there now.
You can ride with us if you like.

The board shows eight women missing.
How closely connected are they?

They all share the same profile.
Young, late teens, early 20s,

pretty, all from inside
the Research Triangle.

Each of them was ambushed.
No witnesses. Does his homework.

He ties them naked to a tree
and cuts their hair.

Only two bodies have been found.
This will probably be the third.

And the killer left a note for us
at the second murder scene.

Signed it "Casanova".
Casanova... The great lover.

This one here,
is she white, black or?

All we know is that she's
a young woman who didn't die happy.

Our Chief Hatfield
will be up at the scene.

I bet you two will get along
like pigs in a blanket.

It's not her.

Dr Cross. My boss, Chief Hatfield.
Chief.

Is it Detective Cross, Doctor Cross
or Doctor Detective Cross?

At a time like this, it doesn't matter.

As you see, it's not your niece.
I'm happy for you.

Have you figured out who she is?
Megan Murphy. University sophomore.

I told your Captain Hathaway I would
help, given your special situation.

I appreciate that.
Consider yourself my guest.

Make yourself at home...
but don't mess around in the kitchen.

Do you understand me?

The TV news crews can't be far off
if the crime author has arrived.

Kyle, it's good to see you.
You too.

I thought you were in Rochester.
Well, things change.

I see you're making friends fast.
I've done my best.

I heard about your niece. I'm sorry.

How long has this been
on the Bureau's wish list?

A while.

Were the others tied up that way?
Yes. He doesn't like square knots.

He used Stayton Cordage, 7 gauge.
Yeah, America's favourite.

And the rest was too prolific to trace.
The guy's a pro.

A real student of the game,
and an enthusiastic rapist.

The first post-mortems indicate vaginal
tears inflicted hours before death.

Then, that's it.
No prints, fibres, semen or hair.

Except what he cut off her.
What about the cause of death?

No signs of torture,
weight loss or drugging.

He just ties them up
and leaves them for the critters.

Real student of the game...
And he likes to play.

We've liaisoned
with the campus police, posted flyers...

Figured somebody must have
seen something important.

An environment fit for blending.
For you, a security nightmare.

For him... paradise.

We're going to get this animal.

We've got an eight-year-old girl
thrown from a motorcycle.

She'll get a CAT scan.

What was she doing on a motorcycle?
Her daddy took her for a ride.

The bandage is about to blow.
We'll have a bleed-out.

I need a tourniquet.
Retractors are ready.

I'll do a cut-down.
Scalpel, please, nurse.

Gauze and suture.

What's her name?
Laura.

It's an awful lot of blood
for such a little girl, Laura.

I'll try to put you back together again.

Hi, Mrs Lee. I'm Dr McTiernan.
Hello.

She's alive.

Mrs Lee, wait...

Mrs Lee, listen.

Laura has suffered severe head
trauma and she's in a coma.

(SHE TRANSLATES)

You can be with her as soon as...

Please let me see my baby!

I want to see the jab!
Now move around the ring.

Around the ring, let's go!
Don't stay there, back up.

Watch your contact.

Barry off, you can stay on.
Who's next?

Kate, let's go.
OK.

Go get him.
All right, let's keep it light, guys.

Come on, Kate, let's see something.

I want to see the jab.
There you go, good!

Let me see the jab.

Come on, on your toes.

Come on, girl!
Nice!

Good, let's go work it!
Come on, on your toes!

Ethan, what are you doing?
Watch your contact.

Kate, are you OK?

<i>This is a sorry substitute for sex.</i>

I said, this is a sorry substitute...
I heard you.

Yeah, OK...

Do you know what I'm looking for?

The way my daddy looked at my mother.
What way?

I can't settle for anything less.

Sure picks lookers, doesn't he?
Yeah, he does.

These women are more
than just attractive.

They are all extraordinary
in some way. Smart, talented...

He ain't choosing them
just for their congeniality.

Ordinarily, they don't. But I think
our guy is a little different.

How so?
Killing is not his ulterior motive.

This guy's a collector.
I bet these women are alive.

Come on. Our boy's brain is as soft
as a two-minute egg.

I think every one of them is tied
to a tree, waiting to be found.

Think about it, Sikes. The three you
found were killed out of sequence.

They weren't the first abducted.
That's right.

That don't mean
that they're not still out there.

You would have found them by now.
He makes no attempt to hide them.

And the way they were killed
is very revealing.

That last walk through the woods.
Marching to their fate.

Exactly. The rape,
cutting off their hair...

It's punishment.
Maybe for violating some trust.

What goddamn trust?

I don't know, Chief.

I don't know...

How would you like to pay?
I'm interested in another book.

It's a picture book for children
in the hospital. It's about being brave.

It sounds like a book by Burke.
I'll see if we have it in stock.

Good night, fish.

(SLIGHT SOUND)


(QUIET THUD)

What do you want from me?
Everything.

Take it back. Jump up, come on!

Come on, show me!

What are you doing?
Get the ball. It's my court.

Don't ever come back here again.

Get out of here. It's my court!

Seth Samuel?

I'm Dr Alex Cross.

Naomi's uncle.
And a cop.

I don't recall inviting you, so...
Can we talk?

Like I said, I don't recall
inviting you here.

Look, we can talk anywhere you want.

I've told you guys everything I know.
Which was nothing.

I've had cops on me for days.
Hauling me to the station at night,

all up my ass about Naomi
and things that are nobody's business.

Looks like your business
is in the public domain, doesn't it?

What do you want to know?

I want to know about Naomi's violin.

It's not on the police inventory.
Is it here?

She used to practise here.
She was always practising on the thing.

But she always
took it home with her. Always.

Yeah, I know.

The cops have no idea, do they?

Not a clue.


Everything you'll need to change
the dressing is right next to you.

I brought some of your clothes, too.

Something for every occasion.

Can you hear me?
Systemic analgesic.

What did you give me?
That's why I picked you, Kate.

Your intelligence.

I appreciate that.
I know most men don't. Can't.

I'm different. You'll see that in time.

Now try not to go back to sleep.

Oh, my God!

Oh, my God!
I need to tell you the rules. Stop.

Why am I here?
You are here... to fall in love.

To experience love.

But now I need you to listen carefully
and take what I say very seriously.

All right?

Don't try to escape.

Don't cry out for help.

And do not try
any of your kickboxing tricks.

Do you understand?

I'll do what I can to help you not break
these rules, but if you do, Kate,

you will really disappoint me.

That's it. There.

See? It didn't hurt, did it?

Don't worry.

You are with Casanova.

<i>Yes?</i>
I thought you'd be out... busy.

<i>Well, you were wrong.</i>

You've got mail.

Do you like it?
<i>Nice.</i>

<i>Exceptional. Really.</i>

I think she's extra special.

How are you feeling, old man?

Swimmers, make your mark!

Come on, keep going!
Move those bodies, let's go!

Kick it up, move it, move it!
Speed, speed, muscle!

Excuse me.
I'm looking for Dr Wick Sachs.

Lane five. He's destroying my varsity.

Thank you.

Let's go, Blondie, pick it up!

I can't tell you much
you don't already know.

I gave Naomi some academic
guidance, which she disregarded.

And that was that. Excuse me.

I don't have time
to get to know patients,

but I do know that Naomi was a special
woman. My heart goes out to you.

Word is that you make time to get
to know some of your special patients.

Whatever you may have heard, I don't
have time to kidnap and mutilate them.

I understand how you must feel,

you being a psychologist,
and a policeman and her uncle.

It must be like suffering
the tortures of the damned.

For me or for her?
Well, both.


It's yours.

He's never made strikes
this close together before, has he?

An intern, huh?

Yeah. He had a vacancy.

Never call out.

Never call out.

Never call out.

Somebody help me!

My name is Kate! I'm Kate McTiernan.

I'm a doctor at the Carolina
Regional Medical Center. I need help!

I know you can hear me!

Come on! Who's out there?

Somebody help...

My name is Kate McTiernan.
Somebody talk to me!

Who is out there?
<i>Be quiet.</i>

<i>Be quiet or he'll kill you.</i>

Oh, my God!

What's your name?

What's your name?
Talk to me, please, please!

Tell me your name.

<i>I'm Mary Jane Capaldi.</i>

It's good to hear your voice,
Mary Jane.

Are you OK?

<i>I'm Kristen Miles. I'm here, too.</i>

<i>I'm Melissa Stanfield.</i>
<i>I don't know how long I've been here.</i>

<i>What month is it?</i>

<i>I'm Samantha Gaines.</i>
<i>Carol Akers.</i>

My name is Naomi Cross.

I've been here for eight days, I think.

Yeah, I know. I miss you too, darling.

You know I do.

How's May?

That's good. Stay with her, you hear?

Hang on, Janell. Just a second.

I'm sorry.

"Odalisques were the most valuable
of the Emperor's treasures,

"gifted in the arts of music and poetry."

Talented.
Special.

"Welcome to Durham, Dr Cross.

"Giovanni Giacomo Casanova
de Seingalt." You've got a fan.

I'll say one thing for our boy.
He's got nice penmanship.

He's just fucking with you.
This means he's tracking the case.

He's reading the local papers.
We can use that.

An odalisque is a statue,
a tall, pointy thing?

No, that's an obelisk.

An odalisque is a harem girl,
a concubine, a sex slave.

There it is, just like you said.

So he's telling us the gals are alive.
Why is he telling us that?

It demonstrates his power,
his dominance.

That fits. Our profiles
of the murdered women show

that they all shared one trait that
would set off the control freak in him.

They are all strong-willed.
They are all defiant.

How many of the other girls
share that profile?

At least one.

Ow!

Are you going to hurt me?
OK, come on.

They can be bigger

and they can be stronger...
You're fucking nuts!

I'll beat you.

Oh, my God!

You could have been the best, Kate.

I may be going crazy, but didn't I
warn you about breaking the rules?

I'm sorry.
"I'm sorry."

"I'm sorry."

I'll do anything you want.
What did you say?

I said I'll do anything you want.
Oh, I know you will.

Give me your arm.

I said give me your arm!

Come on. Give it to me.

Kate!

Kate!

KATE!

Kate!

KATE!

This is not the way it works, Kate.

All right, now. OK.

Easy, girl. Easy, now.

Come on.

What do you know?
Only that she is in shock.

The kids who found her
were fishing near Wykagil.

Wykagil. It's a river way out of town.

Well, lookee here.
We've got a circus up ahead.

Detective, can you confirm...
Back off.

<i>What concerns us</i>
<i>is behaviour that suggests</i>

psychological trauma,
especially acute.

Doctor, can you tell us exactly when
she'll be able to talk to us?

Kate McTiernan appears to be
suffering from post-traumatic shock.

There's no telling when she will be
lucid. It could be hours or weeks.

You have to remember
that she is very lucky to be alive.

At least tell us your best bet.
We can't go on that.

Dr Ruocco, my name is Dr Alex Cross.

I know who you are, I know your work.

I'm consulting with the local police
on this case.

I need to see Kate McTiernan.

I'm sorry, but she
does not need another doctor.

The last thing I want is to crowd you.

My request is personal.

One of the women abducted
was my niece.

I need to talk to her.

It's all right. You're safe now.

You are safe.

This woman's a fighter.
I wouldn't argue with that.

But we thought it was
post-traumatic shock.

Her vitals are meandering downhill.
Everything is shutting down.

And you screened her for drugs?
Yes. Her blood and urine are clean.

Something is doing damage
that we don't have a finger on.

Whoever did this...
...is cunning.

But he doesn't know his history. The
real Casanova wouldn't have approved.

Excuse me. Do you have a PDR?

Unresponsive pupils, loss of muscular
control, escalating tremors...

Benzodiazepine would do that.

But all benzo drugs
show up in blood and urine.

Except Sistol. It's a benzo cousin.

Leukaemia specialists are using it
to take the edge off chemo.

Is it an amnesiac?
Absolutely.

We'll see what your theory
is made of by morning.

Who are you?

My name is Alex Cross.
I'm a policeman from Washington DC.

How do you feel?

Sick.

I'll get you a doctor. Hang on.
Wait. I was given a drug.

I think it was a nervous system...
Yeah, it was Sistol.

But we flushed it out of you.
It's nice to have you back.

Washington?
Yeah.

I'm down here because of my niece.

She disappeared about ten days ago.

Her name was Naomi Cross.

I talked to her.

I talked to her.

Thank you.

I'll get that doctor for you.

I heard so many different voices...

...and I tried not to cry.

Our boy won't show his face here.
If not, he's watching. I guarantee you.

You make it sound like
he ain't cooking on the front burner.

If he's so dumb,
how come we haven't caught him yet?

Ladies and gentlemen.

Good afternoon. I'd like to introduce
to you a very brave young lady.

Dr Kate McTiernan.

Dr McTiernan will make
a brief statement, and that's all.

No questions, please.

Hello, I'm Kate McTiernan.

First, I'd like to say something to the
families who have a loved one missing.

Please, do not give up hope. There are
other women where I was held,

and I believe in my heart
that they're still alive.

Second, to the boys who fished me out
of the river and saved my life,

and to the nurses and doctors here
who are taking such good care of me,

and for the thousands
of letters and prayers

I have received from
all across America, thank you.

And last...

...to the man
who calls himself "Casanova",

the man who took me
from my own home

and ultimately tried to kill me.

I broke your rules. Just me.

None of the other women helped.

So if you're looking for
someone to blame, blame me.

That's all I have to say right now.

Thank you for taking my message
to the families of the missing.

I hope it helps a little bit. Thank you.

What do you hear? Dogs?
No.

Any kind of animals? Is it a farm?
I don't know.

Do you hear the river?
No.

I hear him... whispering.
What does he say?

I can feel his mouth
on my ear, his breath.

He tells me that he loves me.

Tell me about his face.
Tell me about his eyes, his mouth.
