Cherry are you in there?

Just a second.

What are you doing in there?

Girl's stuff!

Yeah, I know I
got it. I'm on it.

Today, today, come on.

I know, I know. God.

I'm waiting.

Fuck.

First of all, you're late.

I know, I'm sorry.

Then you start your shift

with a 10 minute
break in the bathroom?

We're done.

I..

No, I'm done.

Roger, you don't
wanna do this.

No, no, no.

I can find someone else.
What is the store,

without you and me?

You never change.

I'm tired.

Let me prove it to you.

You know, no more excuses.

Oh my God.

No more being late.

She never stops.

Please.

Stop it.

I don't know why you do this.

You lose at this
game every time.

All right.

I guess we can go one more day.

Thank you.
But no more bullshit.

From now on, I mean it.

I don't wanna hear
any more of this,

I couldn't start
my car, you know,

I had to take the
cat to the dentist.

I fell asleep on the bus.

From now on, you'll be on time.

You'll be above reproach.

You're gonna be...

Responsible.
Responsible!

That's shit, okay.

One more fuck up
and you're done.

Hello?

Hey I-
"Gotcha.

Can't get to the phone right now

so just leave me a
message, or don't.

Peace".

Hey, hey.

You guys look like you
would like some magic.

Oh magic!

Yes.

Okay so,

Keep your eyes on this red ball.

Pop in here.

That's so cool.

Let's go in here

and see if they have a
princess dress for Sarah.

I want a balloon.

Could you?

Yeah, no, for sure.

Do you mind watching
him for a minute

while I run in real quick?

Actually, I...
Thank you. Stay here

with the nice balloon lady.

Be careful little prince,

if you pop them all,
you'll turn into a frog.

Sorry, I don't make the rules.

Make me Spider-man.

How about a flower?

Boring.

Those are for girls.

Dude, no.

Princes love flowers.

How about a sword?

A sword for a brave
knight like you?

Fine.

Okay.

Sword it is.

Okay, here's your sword.

Tell your mom tips
are appreciated.

Oh, this is awesome.

A wiener!

Mom, mom.
Ah,

ma'am it's a sword.

You little shit.

It does look like a
sword, doesn't it?

Just gimme your jacket.

Please, Roger I...

Look, I don't wanna hear it.

I got bills to pay.

Yeah.

I got a rent increase.

You know, I have
online competition.

I gotta put up with all of that.

Yeah.
You know what I need

is a good, responsible employee.

Not some grown up kid.

Roger,

I just found out I'm...

I'm pregnant.

That's good.

You haven't used
that one before.

And you know what, how dare you?

Okay.

I can prove it to you.

No, just gimme the jacket.

It was here just a second ago

Just gimme one,

second.
You don't understand.

You're fired.

I'll put your check in the mail.

Whatever.

Hello?

We are closing.

Our regular office hours are
Monday to Friday, nine to six.

Saturday by appointment only.

Right, I just really
need to see a doctor.

Do you have an appointment?

No.

I'm sorry, you have
to come back on Monday,

unless it's an emergency.

You can call, or go online
to schedule an appointment.

Right, but I think that
I'm probably pregnant,

so that means I need to see
a doctor, like right now.

Hello?

Oh no, she's
coming back again.

Hello, there's been
an emergency out here.

We are closed.

Right, but there's an
emergency with my breast.

I think I have lumps.

I wake up vomit.

Ugh I don't have
enough time for this.

I'm very nauseous
all the time.

Ma'am stop.

Sometimes I feel very lumpy.

Okay, ma'am.

It's okay, you can just

ma'am, ma'am, stop it.

I can see you.

Look over here.

Yeah hey, you were just here.

And honestly, you
really need to work on

that British accent, come on.

What if something
is really wrong?

I don't wanna die.

Hey, doc, can you take
one last person please?

Okay.

Today's office visit could
range from $30 to $250,

depending on what the
doctor recommends.

A typical uninsured
visit is $470.

Do you have health insurance?

No.

Okay.

Obamacare, Medicare maybe?

I missed those deadlines.

All right.

You may benefit from a
federal support program.

Let's see.

Do you have a job?

Yes.

No.

Yes, or no?

Not anymore.

Okay, no job.

No health insurance, Jesus.

Do you have any dependents?

Outside of yourself do
you care for anyone?

A child, parents?
Right.

No, nah, it's just me.

All right.

Do you make more than
$17,237 per year?

That is so specific.

I think ...

no.

Okay.
No, I am very poor.

Smart choice.

All right, you're good.

You don't have to pay today.

Take a seat and fill out
the intake paperwork.

Hey mom,

I can't really talk right now.
Hi sweetie.

How are you?

Yeah, no, I'm good, just...

Are you still at work?

Yep.

Just making some balloons.

Listen, I just wanna know
if we'll have the honor

of seeing you tomorrow?

What's the plan tomorrow?

Mother's Day.

Did you forget?

No, no.

I mean, how could I
forget your special day?

Your sister's in town.

I'd appreciate if you two
didn't fight for once.

Okay.

Hey, Cherry.

Yeah, mom I gotta go.

It's grandma's recipe.
Take your time.

It's been cooking for hours.

Yeah, I know. I
really gotta go.

Okay, sweetie.
Yeah, okay.

Love you.

See you tomorrow.

That's for you... I'm
so sorry about that.

Come on. Hands!

Come on.

Yeah, just,

I'll see you in five minutes.

Okay, see you soon.

Bye.

Have a seat.

Thank you.

All right, so Cherry, you
have a pain in the breast.

So, what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna give you a robe

You're gonna put that on.

I'm gonna come back in
a few moments, okay?

Right so I...

Here you go.

Can I come in?

Yeah.
Okay, arms up.

Yeah, you could put that away.

Arms up, I'm just
gonna take this down.

All right?

And I'll do the
examination part,

I'm just gonna start here.

Do you ever self-examine
your breasts?

No.

Okay.

Does your family have a
history of breast cancer?

I don't think so.

You should know.

It's a good thing to know.

Have you discussed
this with your mom?

We don't really talk
about stuff like that.

You should.

It's important to know
what kind of illnesses

run in your family.

Gives you a lot of good
insight for the future.

Okay, arms down.

I can tell you that

your breast exam is
healthy and normal.

I think that we can just...

Sorry to interrupt.

I need your signature
for the labs.

Okay, you can get dressed
and I'll be right back, okay?

Weird little alien.

Okay, so I am gonna print
out your medical report,

and I can go, finally.

I mean you can go,
and you can take this.

So I'm pregnant.

I think.

That's actually the
reason why I'm here.

Also, I'm sorry for lying,

but I took my test this morning,

but then I lost it at
work and it said positive,

but the box said 99% accuracy.

And if I am the 1%, I mean,
that is so on brand for me I-

Well, you know, honestly,
Cherry to be honest,

they say that just to
avoid lawsuits, okay?

Those tests are fairly accurate.

Okay, well, let's
just start over.

We'll begin with
your health history.

Okay, so which contraceptive
method do you use?

We go with pulling out.

Pulling out?

Withdrawal.

That's the least effective
contraceptive method.

It doesn't prevent
against STDs either.

Yeah, I know.

I was on the pill off and on,

but I just don't like
taking drugs every day.

I mean, hormonal ones.

When was your last period?

So, it's weird.

I thought that I had
something a few weeks ago,

but my boobs were really sore

and I just kept thinking
that my period would hit.

And then I waited a
week, and then two,

and then I was too
scared to take a test

and now I am here so.

Okay.

Have a seat.

The gel's a little cold.

You all right?
Yep.

No, this is not weird at all.

It's not.

Let's see what we have.

We have something.

You're definitely pregnant.

Oh my God.

And you are 10 weeks.

10 weeks?
To be exact.

How is that even possible?

Well, we calculate
it from the first day

of your last period.

So, right now you're
entering your 11th week

and the fetus, just so you know,

it's about the size
of a big raspberry.

You mentioned that you
had your last period

at the beginning of March.

Is that right?

Yeah, I think so.

So, that means you
would've gotten you...

oh you would've gotten
pregnant around March 17th.

St. Patrick's Day.

That was Nick's birthday.

It did get a little wild.

So, unfortunately you
don't have a lot of time

to make some big
decisions, you know,

for an abortion by pill,
you only have 24 hours.

Oh God.

Can I see it?

Okay.

Whoa.

What's it sound like in there?

Are you sure?

You don't have to.

Yeah.

I'm terrified.

I mean,

the idea of a future
potential human

just like swimming
around inside of me,

is really, really scary.

But then I was thinking about it

and,

it's kind of like a superpower.

Okay, well, have
you shared this news

with anyone in your life?

Dad?

Oh my God, my dad is like

the last person.
No, no, not your dad.

The father.

The father.

Right.

Nick.

What would you do?

Would I do?

I don't think you should
be asking me that.

I'm not the one
sitting there pregnant.

Yes you know what I mean.

Yeah.

So, outside of a boy, or a girl,

what are my options?

You have two
options, right now.

If you choose to do nothing,

you're gonna have a baby to
take care of in a few months.

Okay?

If you decide not to go forward,

here in California,
you have until 11 weeks

for an abortion by pill,

until 24 weeks for
surgical abortion.

And it's a more costly, and
it's a heavier procedure.

That's it.

Ya.

I just never thought
this would be me.

There's nothing wrong
with it. It's just...

It's other girls
that get abortions.

I know.

It's not on our bucket list
of things to do in life.

I get you.

Just so you know,

an abortion by pill is
similar to a miscarriage

and it costs $500.

500 bucks?
Yes.

But you don't have to worry,

'cause health insurance
covers most of it.

Let's see...

okay

you don't have it.

Cherry having a baby,

it can be a beautiful
thing, trust me.

But it'll change your life.

Turn it right upside down.

But it'll make
me an adult, right?

Not necessarily.

Listen, you have
to think about it.

You gotta take your time.

You gotta make this
decision yourself.

What I can do for you is
just make an appointment

to come back Monday and you
can tell me what you decide

and we can just
take it from there.

How's that?

Yeah.

Okay?

Promise me you'll come?

I promise.

Good.

"Can't get to the
phone right now.

So just leave me a
message, or don't.

Peace".

Hey Nick, please call me back.

We need to talk.

Where the fuck are you?

Hey guys.

Hey Cherry,

long time no see.

Yeah.

You guys are looking
good, new outfits.

What is she doing here?

What the hell.

Cherry? What are you doing here?

I wasn't expecting you anymore.

Yeah I know, I'm
sorry I'm late.

Late?

I mean, I'd say
you're pretty damn late.

Where were you for the bat
mitzvah and the baby shower?

Look, I am sorry
for being MIA,

but I'm here now
and ready to roll.

Dude, it's been weeks.

I thought you weren't interested

in being part of
our group anymore.

No, of course I am.

I just, I got busy, you know?

Right.

I'm sure you're real busy
with what's his face.

Magic Nick!
Stop.

Don't be jealous, you
know I love you more.

Well, I hate you.

Hey, can we talk
just for a second?

Yeah, hey I was actually just
gonna make an announcement.

You're gonna love it.

Can I go first?

Yeah.
Okay, cool.

So, I just got the
results for our submission

for the Sunshine Summer tour

and it looks like... we got it!

We'll be touring
all across the US

and Europe for six months.

You guys did amazing.

Rehearsals start next week.

You guys rock.

Thank you for all
your hard work.

Now let's rock.

That is crazy.

I mean, why didn't you
tell me you submitted this?

I mean, when?

You weren't here.

Yeah, no totally.

Tour, I mean.

Cherry, this is the
start of something huge.

I can feel it, we did this.

Yeah, yeah we did.

Why do you look
like you just lost

a roller contest in
the eighth grade?

It's just a big
surprise, that's all.

I mean, it's amazing.

Great

Cherry, you're starting
to scare the shit outta me.

Please don't let
me down, not now.

Dude, I'm not
gonna let you down.

I don't know ... I
need to think about it.

There's nothing
to think about.

Listen, we're about to start.

Can we put a pin on this?

Yeah, totally.
Okay.

Oh, I'm sorry.

You can't perform tonight.

What?

We have all new choreography
and all new outfits.

You can't wear this.

I'm sorry...

Here, why don't you
just take a seat,

catch up for next time?

Yeah.

Sorry.

It's all good.

Hey, you catches the moves?

Yeah, totally.

You're okay?

Something seems off.

Yeah. No...

I got fired today.

So, that's a bummer.

Again?

You really know how to
make a girl feel better.

No, I'm sorry, but I mean,

you weren't planning
on being a clown

the rest of your life were you?

We have talked about this.

I'm an magician, not a clown
and there is a difference.

I'm sorry.

That sucks.

But hey, at least you don't
have to quit your job,

because I'm expecting full
commitment for this tour.

Yeah, I just, I don't know.

I don't know if
I can go on tour.

What?

What do you mean?

I don't know, I think
I wanna settle down.

With Nick.

You're gonna throw
away your passion

for a fling?

It's not a fling.

I moved in with the dude, okay?

Sorry if I have a love life.

Okay, I'm sorry.

You love Nick and
Nick loves you.

I get it.

But you need to figure
out what you want.

So, are you in, or are you out?

Look at them.

Do you even need me?

What are you talking about?

You're great.

It's just, are you committed?

You haven't been to
practice in weeks.

Look, honestly,

this tour is just another
gig for what a few months

and then we're right
back here in LA,

dancing for fucking
birthday parties like..

So you just wanna quit,
give up on your dreams?

That's not what I said.

Like always, you never give
yourself a chance do you?

Things change.

Dreams change and apparently,

people change.

Classic Cherry!

Let me know when you
figure out your shit!

This party blows anyway.

Hey Steph.

Hi Cherry.

Hey, how's it going?

Cherry! How's it going?

â™ª I went to the doctor, said
I'm crazy for your love â™ª

â™ª Wrote me a prescription â™ª

Hey stranger.

Hey.

I'm sorry I didn't
call you back.

I just kinda had a crazy day.

You can't even imagine.

Oh I can.

My console broke down.

I had to run to
Lucas's and borrow his

and meeting with the
band and I saw your text.

Is everything okay?

Could we talk in private?

Just give me one minute.

â™ª I guess I'm falling in love â™ª

â™ª Baby you're my rock star â™ª

â™ª Smashing all my guitars â™ª

How's everybody doing tonight?

We're wrapping up this evening

so it'll slow down.

Enjoy.

â™ª I was tempted â™ª

â™ª Tempted by your smile â™ª

You come here often?

Stop.

Oh my God, I
didn't even tell you.

My manager called earlier.

He wants to book me for
shows all over the place.

Cool.

I know, right?

And then we got the album
coming out next month.

It's gonna be crazy,
but it's gonna be good.

Yeah, totally.

You're alright?

Yeah.

What did I do?

â™ª I was tempted â™ª

â™ª Tempted by your eyes â™ª

â™ª I was tempted â™ª

â™ª The promises, the lies â™ª

â™ª Just keep hurting â™ª

You can't be in here.

No but you can.

Is this what was so urgent?

I love when you do that.

I love it too.

I love you.

I'm on the clock.

I should probably
go back out there.

Okay.

I'm sorry.

We can do this at home.

Your roommates
are always around.

I'm sorry.

You coming back out there?

Yeah.

I'll see you out there.

Great.

This song is dedicated to
a very special lady, Cherry.

Could you watch the booth?

Stick with disco.

Let's talk outside.

Maybe it'll be a DJ.

Is this some kind of joke?

'Cause it's not funny.

It's not.

Are you really pregnant?

Yeah.
You're sure?

I mean, the doctor
seems pretty sure so yeah.

Holy fuck.

Hey,

it's gonna be okay.

I just don't know
how it happened.

We're cautious, right?

I always pull out.

I mean, not always.

Look, our families will help us

and I am gonna get a new
job, a really good job.

And you have a garage that
we can turn into a bedroom.

I have so many friends
who did that in college.

Cherry, Cherry, I just
paid off a student loan.

I work this job at night.

We share a three
bedroom apartment

with four other dudes
that smoke pot all day.

I'm supposed to start my career.

How are we gonna do
that with a baby?

We can make it work.

Lifetime.

This is a lifetime.

This is forever.

I'm not scared.

I love you.

It's not about that.

Okay, so what's it about?

I had a great dad and
I wanna be a great dad.

You know, I watched my dad

just throw away
his dreams for me?

You know how that made me feel?

It was absolutely pathetic.

You think that's pathetic.

You wanna just spend
the rest of your life

with your dumb band
pressing buttons

and switching tracks?
My dumb band.

My dumb band, you love my music.

I do, I just,

I know what a great
dad you could be

and like your father and
I'm gonna try not to be

a fucked up mom.

You're gonna try not
to be a fucked up mom?

How the hell are
you gonna do that,

when you can't even afford

your own apartment Cherry?
Excuse me?

It's just not a good idea.

Okay.

I don't want to have a kid

and I especially don't want to
have a fucking kid with you.

I like you, but this was
not part of the plan.

It wasn't part of my plan,

sure it wasn't
part of your plan.

We're young.

Okay, well I don't
need your permission.

You don't need my... what
the fuck are you gonna do?

Have a baby behind my back?
Maybe.

It's my body, my choice.

Fuck that.

Fuck you.

I'm out.

Nick! What's going
on with the music?

Two minutes, I'm coming.

Keep your damn
problems for yourself.

Stay stoned with
your roommates.

Give me back the
money you owe me.

Asshole!

Hey mom, it's me.

Cherry is that you? On time?

Going upstairs,
will be right back.

Okay.

We're in the kitchen
with your sister.

â™ª Winter wings slightly
touching your soft skin â™ª

â™ª There's gotta be
a brighter a day â™ª

â™ª A summer breeze,
some silk and honey â™ª

â™ª A big wild horse
is running through â™ª

â™ª The golden doors â™ª

â™ª You know you gotta
take the ride â™ª

â™ª It's now or never by my side â™ª

â™ª Don't be shy â™ª

â™ª Nobody changes they just lie â™ª

â™ª Take your fate by the end â™ª

â™ª It's time to conquer
your own land â™ª

â™ª Don't be shy â™ª

â™ª Nobody changes they just lie â™ª

â™ª Take your own
fate by the end â™ª

â™ª It's time to conquer
your own land â™ª

Okay everybody,

Happy Sunday.

Bad news.

I'm signing up for unemployment.

The good news though,

not sterile.

Father is outta of the picture.

Any support on weekend?

Cherry come down, help
your sister set the table.

Okay.

Okay.

Miles Frederick went
from being a nice gentleman

to a sexual maniac.

There will be no
evidence of financial

or family motive.
Not guilty!

Hi.

I feel like I saw you
wore that same outfit

like when you were 12.

And it's just as cute.

Check out what I found.

So young and already
a little terror.

Oh my God.

Do I need to remind
you this was my doll,

my Dorothy. 96.

Poor Dorothy.

What happened to her?

I think I burned her.

I think you did too.

Is everything okay?

You look tired, I mean,

even more tired than usual.

Yeah, I got knocked
up by my drug dealer

and I'm probably
gonna live in my car

for the rest of my life,
so I'm crushing it.

Very funny.

Work's still going well?

I have like four
cases simultaneously.

I'm still losing my mind.

I might burn the place down,
but yeah, it's going great.

Yeah.

Well I'm sure you'll be
running the place by next year.

Well sometimes I just
wish I could live on love.

Like you.

Yeah.

Hey, where's grandma?

She's in there.

Hey gram.

Cool shades grandma.

What are you doing?

Amanda,

It's so lovely to see ya.

It's Cherry, grandma.

Robert was such
a handsome man.

But who is this
woman beside him?

Oh I don't know.

You want a raspberry?

They're very good for you.

A lot of vitamins.

Grandma, can
you keep a secret?

Sure.

Mom, do you need help?

I'm pregnant.

Again, at your age?

Again?

Definitely a first.

I can't stop thinking about it.

You know, it's gonna
be a boy, or a girl?

Or both.

You know, maybe a baby will
gimme something to focus on.

Yeah.

Yeah.

No.

You think I'll go to
hell if I get rid of it?

I mean, I was probably
going there anyway.

I just wish I could
talk to future me.

She would tell me
what the fuck to do.

Amanda, at your age,

the first time I
knew I was pregnant,

I didn't eat for 20 days.

That's a very long time.

It didn't work.

But grandma, then
we wouldn't be here.

Well, I would've
had a different life.

I would've been
fine with that too.

Huh.

Yeah, I would've been-

Cherry, mom, lunch is
ready, come and get it.

We should go before she
thinks you're abducted.

Oh, you know, I once had
an affair with a woman,

but don't tell Robert.

â™ª I used to be a rock star â™ª

Okay.

â™ª The prettiest girl
on the road star â™ª

â™ª My heart was full of sparks â™ª

We're dancing

â™ª My hands full of light â™ª

â™ª I was the queen
of the moon star â™ª

I wonder what kind of
crap she has up today.

Anyhow, Bon appetite.

Robert loved New Year's Eve.

It's Mother's Day Mom.

We always had
our special time.

Oh.

When the kids
were off to sleep.

Okay, mom, that's great.

Have some bread.

Happy Mother's Day mom.

Thank you honey.

Mom told me your room
is gonna be an Airbnb.

Yeah.

Yeah, Cherry's
almost done packing

and I think the extra
money would come in handy,

because I'm still negotiating
with mom's retirement home.

Yeah.

Not that I'm in any rush
to see grandma go away,

but I raised two
lovely daughters and
I'm done with diapers.

So, time for a little
time to myself.

That's a good idea.

So you're gonna move
in with this boyfriend?

So, actually I think,

I might do

Cherry, are you
gonna move back in?

I'm sorry you stayed for
like ever at Jeffrey's parents.

That was different
because I was an intern

in New York, right?
In New York.

Yeah.

You don't know how
expensive rent is in New York.

It's very expensive.

So, why don't you
just move back to LA?

Why don't you just
stop making everything...

You're too good for LA?

All right girls, cut it out.

For once we're all together.

Let's just have a
peaceful day. Okay?

Anna, don't tease your sister.

Not everyone has the
chance to go to law school.

Sure.

And Cherry.

Your sister's right, time to
stand on your own two feet.

It is.

It's literally a
figure of speech.

You didn't have to stand up.

I have something to say.

Who's dead?

No one's dead mom.

Cherry are you coming
out, to us right now?

I just broke up with
my boyfriend actually.

His name is Nick.
Oh honey.

Was Nick.

Is Nick.

We are not together anymore.

And also, I quit my job
at the costume shop.

But to look for
something better.

A real job, a good job,
maybe even your job

and oh my God, okay.

To be honest, I am not
doing very well right now.

I feel like kind of lost

but you know, I'm
gonna figure it out.

I'm figuring it out
on my own, right now.

Also, another very important
thing that I have to say is...

can you please stop?

I'm trying to do something.

Oh my gosh, pumpkin.

What's wrong?

I'm sorry, I'm just
not doing well either.

Oh, what's the matter sweetie?

You know, Jeffrey
and I, we've been...?

Yeah.

Well...

What?

What honey?

Oh my God.

I can't get pregnant.

I can't get pregnant.

Oh sweetie.

Oh honey.

I had no idea that
you and Jefferey

were trying to have a baby.

Oh, we've been
trying for months

and I took some herbal pills

my friend referred to me.
You know what?

Nevermind.

What's going on?

Mother's Day drama

for everyone.

I know how to cheer them up.

I feel like it
should, you know?

The minute you stop stressing
about it, that's when it-

Oh my God.

Happy New Year!

Okay, well so much for that.

Ya?

Did you and dad have have
that problem getting pregnant?

Being preg, getting oh no.

Not at all.
Yeah.

You know, I think she
just is stressed out.

I think she's just
working too hard.

Mom, did you know about me?
Or,

you know what?

It could have been Jeffrey.

Did you know about me?

What about you?

If I was a boy, or a girl?

Oh,

honey, well,

you were definitely
supposed to be a boy,

until you popped out a girl.

Surprise!

Well, surprise for me.

Your father showed
up two hours late.

So, what was it that you
wanted to talk about?

If it's money, honey, you
know, I already told you

I've helped you

as much as I can.
It's not always about money.

Okay, okay.

Well, is it the boyfriend?

It's not always boys either.

Grandma always says,

"After trains and
after men never run.

There's always
one coming later".

I know.

What is it,

babe?

Could I just stay
here, for a couple days?

It's just until I
find another place,

I really, really don't
wanna stay with Nick

and I don't know,

I could help grandma,

take her on some walks,

or to the ballroom.

I know she misses dancing.

You wanna help, really?

Yeah.

Well, I'm not gonna let you
sleep in the street, honey.

Of course you can stay.

Thanks.

And since you wanna
make yourself useful,

bring that to the neighbor.

They'll be happy to see you.

Let's kick your sister
out of her mess.

Hot pie!

On it.

So what happened?

I don't really know.

I think she was making
like a weird noise,

so I stopped and she just
wouldn't turn back on.

Maybe it's the battery.

Let's see.

You know, I can't believe
that old bug is still running.

I remember your grandma in it.

Need some help?

No, I'm fine.

It's sunny.

Yeah, it's hot.

So, what's up?

Same, same.

I gotta check it.

â™ª For that you have to pay â™ª

â™ª She said she
would fix my body â™ª

You love this song.

I know you love this song.

You used to play
it all the time.

â™ª Squeezed me till I popped â™ª

â™ª She said she would
keep it coming â™ª

â™ª Till she heard
me holler stop â™ª

Doctor Juice!

Come on,

You feel it a little bit.

You are crazy, you know that?

Okay, that's enough.

We're good.

Hey, wait.

Dad.

How about some fruit?

No, I'm good.

Didn't you have
lunch with your mom?

Well, yeah, but I
didn't have dessert.

Yeah, I gotta go.

I'm out of time so.

Do you really wanna
go back to work?

There's a coconut with
your name on it, please.

All right quick.

Hey.

A passion fruit salad, please.

I'll have a fresh coconut.

Can we sit over there?

Yes please.

Great.

So, mom said you were
expecting a boy with me.

What?

You didn't know I
was gonna be a girl.

Oh,

yeah right.

Were you disappointed?

What do you mean?

I mean, you
wanted a boy, right?

I, you know, I
would've liked a boy.

But I'm happy with
you two girls.

You get what you get.

Yeah.

So, when did you know
you wanted to be a dad?

What is this,
like "50 questions"?

I mean, did you and mom
just like wake up one day

and you were like
"Let's have babies".

I don't know.

It happened, when
it had to happen.

Right.

What?

I dunno.

It seems like sometimes
you don't really care.

How can you say that?

I raised you.

I take care of the household.

I worked hard.

That's not what I mean.

You know, I'm always here
for you to move your stuff

and be your mechanic

and you're still alive.

So, I think I did a pretty
good job as a parent.

Yeah, totally.

But you never call.

I just, I don't like talking
on the phone, that's all.

But you don't know
anything about me.

I mean, you don't know
where I live, or what I do,

or even the name
of my boyfriend.

Of course I do.

Steven.

Nick.

Steven was like two years ago

and Nick doesn't even matter.

We broke up.

You won't meet him.

And I lost my job,
so I'm a real winner.

I didn't know
you had a new job.

The costume shop.

Oh, okay.

Look,

maybe I wasn't the best father,

but,

you know, things
were not easy for me.

Times were tough.

And you'll see when you get
married and you have kids,

you know, there will
be so many moments

that you want to give up.

But I didn't give up.

I'm still here for you girls.

You know you were wanted,

right?

I really gotta get back to work.

Yeah.

Here, there's
some cash in there.

I'm gonna use the bathroom
next door, I'll be right back.

Three dollars please.

Cherry let's go.

Thanks.

Thanks for the help.

You're welcome.

Bye.

Thank you.

â™ª In this world I live in â™ª

â™ª I can make it or lose â™ª

â™ª In this cold cold night â™ª

â™ª I can fall and get a bruise â™ª

â™ª In the lights of the night â™ª

â™ª I can reach up to the sky â™ª

â™ª But if you were the one
who tried to take my light â™ª

â™ª I won't let you roll
me in your darkest mud â™ª

â™ª 'Cause if you are winning
I can't count on my luck â™ª

â™ª I am light I am power â™ª

â™ª Though I don't
look like that â™ª

â™ª I'm stronger
'cause I'm loved â™ª

â™ª And you'll never beat that â™ª

â™ª If I lose - nothing to lose â™ª

â™ª Only God knows where I'm at â™ª

â™ª If I choose - nothing to
choose anyway it's not my bet â™ª

â™ª If I cruise down
the dark street â™ª

â™ª Running from the
evil on my back â™ª

â™ª I hope there maybe will be â™ª

â™ª But there maybe will be â™ª

â™ª Someone good around â™ª

"Hey sis,

just wanted you to know,

I think you're gonna be
an amazing mom one day

and I'm gonna be a
kick ass aunt, so.

I'm here if you
ever need to talk,

I'm here for you

and be ready for my
next trip to New York,

because I really wanna
come and visit you.

Okay, well I love you.

Bye".

â™ª If I lose - nothing to lose
only God knows where I'm at â™ª

â™ª If I choose - nothing to
choose anyway it's not my bet â™ª

â™ª If I cruise down
the dark street â™ª

â™ª Running from the
evil on my back â™ª

â™ª I hope there maybe we'll be â™ª

â™ª But there maybe will be â™ª

â™ª But there maybe will be â™ª

â™ª Now I have lost â™ª

â™ª Everything that
seemed important â™ª

â™ª And I will walk â™ª

â™ª Seeming maybe
little ignorant â™ª

Hi babe.

You can't call
me that anymore.

What do you want?

You didn't pick up your phone.

I thought maybe you needed it.

Thanks.

Okay, what are you
actually doing here?

I'm sorry,

for the other night.

If you're gonna have the baby,

I'm not gonna force
you to do anything.

Look, I don't have the answers,
but we'll figure it out.

We'll get real jobs

and our own apartment.

I'll stop the music.

It's never a good time to
become a parent, right?

You don't have to
convince yourself,

or me.

I'm not keeping it.

You sure?

Yeah.

I know I wanna be a mom.

Just, not right now.

Okay.

I guess that's what
being an adult is,

you know, deciding
what's best for me.

Sounds pretty responsible.

So, who are you and what
have you done with Cherry?

What are you gonna do now?

I have an appointment at 10.

Do you, want me to come?

Thanks,

but no, I'm good.

So,

what about us?

Are we together still, or ?

I mean, were we really?

I mean, are people just
together to get married

and have kids?

I don't know.

We definitely have a shit ton
to learn and do first though.

You more than me.

Debatable.

Okay.

I will be over to your place
to pick up my stuff tonight.

You can stay as
long as you want.

I promise.

No, I'm good.

I actually wanna spend
some time with my family.

Up to you.

You dumped me, but I'm
still here for you Cherry.

Hey.

When you're a big shot,
don't forget about me.

See you around.

Wow.

For once you're on time.

Shocker, I know.

Let me guess, you
want your job back?

Well, it's not gonna happen.

I'm permanently shutting
down everything.

Downsizing.

I actually was hoping
to get my paycheck.

Well, it's not ready yet,

next week.

Yeah, I know. It's just,

I kind of need the money asap,

if possible in cash.

I found this in the
alley, on the ground.

Look familiar?

Yes, I think I
recognize this magic wand.

I'm sorry, I
didn't believe you.

It's okay.

It actually doesn't
even matter anymore.

So, what are you gonna do?

Get back on track
if it's not too late.

Wait,

you're not gonna go to work
for the online competition,

are you?

I would never.

So, about the cash

Oh, just one minute.

I'll get it.

Here you go.

Thank you.
Be careful with that.

I will.

Put it to good use.

Thank you.

I'm gonna miss you Missy.

I'm gonna miss you too.

I'm gonna miss this store.

Yeah.

I'll miss it too.

Thanks.

Oh, take the
balloons with you.

I'm shutting down the stand too.

Take the stand, take it all!

I'm on it.

You,

look like you could
use a balloon.

Thanks.

Oh wait, you guys
definitely need a balloon.

That's so cute.

Thank you.

â™ª Hey sunshine in the sky â™ª

â™ª Oh I can feel the
beams right on my face â™ª

â™ª Come it would be so nice â™ª

â™ª All together in the sunlight â™ª

â™ª No I don't know
where I'm going â™ª

â™ª But I bet the
place is kicking â™ª

â™ª And the sun is over you
and me together baby â™ª

â™ª Sway on the road â™ª

â™ª Once upon a time
far far away â™ª

â™ª In the beautiful
age of innocence â™ª

â™ª I can still see
your eyes at night â™ª

â™ª Looking into mine
like I was the one â™ª

â™ª I used to be a rock star â™ª

â™ª The prettiest
girl on the road â™ª

â™ª My voice was full of charm â™ª

â™ª I was the queen of the moon â™ª

â™ª As the sun ran away â™ª

â™ª And I'm forever â™ª

â™ª In the shade â™ª

â™ª I â™ª

â™ª Used to be a bright star â™ª

â™ª Why did the gazes fade away â™ª

â™ª Inside I'm still the same â™ª

â™ª I â™ª

â™ª Used to be a rock star â™ª

â™ª The prettiest
girl on the road â™ª

â™ª My heart was full of sparks â™ª

â™ª My head full of life â™ª

â™ª I â™ª

â™ª Used to a rock star â™ª

â™ª The pretties
girl on the road â™ª

â™ª My voice was full of joy â™ª

â™ª I â™ª

â™ª Was the queen of the moon â™ª

â™ª But the sun ran away â™ª

â™ª And I'm forever â™ª

â™ª In the shade â™ª

â™ª Now â™ª

â™ª I'm no longer a bright star â™ª

â™ª But soon I will
endlessly shine â™ª

â™ª In the sky â™ª
