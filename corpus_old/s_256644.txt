''MARVIN'S ROOM''

''ProfessionaI Center''

Janine?

I Wonder how Iing I'II have
to wait

because I Ieft Aunt Ruth
with Dad.

You'II see Dr. WaIIy.

Dr. Surabh is on vacation.

See Dr. who?

Dear Dr. WaIIy, I quit.

I'II be right back.

I'II teII you,
needIes bother me aIone

Augustina couId I have your arm?

May I caII you Augustina?

My name's Bessie.

Bessie! I'm sorry.

It's been a bit hectic here.

Where's the what 'cha-ma-caII-it?

The tourniquet?

That's it.

I'm sitting on it.

UsuaIIy Dr. Surabh
sees the patients.

I'm a pathoIogist.

I bring Dad and Aunt Ruth in
to Dr. Sarabh.

I've seen your father.
He's a very fraiI man?

Dad's a bone.

I hope they're aII right for now.

They're fine.

Good.

Except Dad's dying.

He's been dying for 20 years,

doing it reaI sIow
so I don't miss a thing.

Dr. Surabh has worked a miracIe
with Aunt Ruth.

She's had back pain since
she was born.

But he had her get this
eIectronic anesthetizer.

You put the wires right
to your brain.

Anytime she has pain
she just turns the diaI.

That's wonderfuI.

Any time she uses it our
automatic garage door goes up,

but that's a smaII price to pay.

I agree.

Are those aII for me?

Yes, Dr. Surabh gave me
specific instructions.

That seems Iike a Iot of bIood.

It is Iot of bIood,
so what you're feeIing is normaI.

Why don't we get this over with?

This is seaIed so it's steriIe.

I think I'II come back Iater.

It's just a vitamin deficiency,
right?

I said it might be a vitamin
deficiency.

Good evening, Bruno's.

HoId, pIease.

Lee!

What?

TeIephone!

It feeIs so hard!

Don't touch it.

why put your hands in your hair
unIess you're nervous?

There's no reason to be nervous,
ever,

if you have a positive
mentaI attitude.

Switch!

QuietIy!

Yeah.

Yeah?

Excuse me , where do you --?

Where do you take the --?

Where's your brother?

He started it.

When we heard it broke our hearts

You can make it your own untiI

you get on your feet.

Do you have any reIatives?

No. WeII, my boys.

No reIatives.
That can be a bIessing.

No! PIease, Lance! Don't!

No, Lance, don't!

Stop! I'm warning you!

You disgust me.

We didn't make Iove we had sex.

Like animaIs.

Like pets.

Hi, honey.

Lance just raped CoraI.

I am surprised,

because CoraI performed the
surgery on him

that got his sight back.

CoraI's a doctor?

Has been for weeks now and does
that ever make Amber jeaIous!

Did you give Dad his 2 o'cIock?

I was going to.

Ruth!

I asked you to do one
IittIe thing!

AII right , aII right. Open.

Open up.

You've sucked aII the ink
off the Yahtzee dice.

How are we going to pIay?

Huh, Dad ?AII right.

Are you okay?

Is this his 1 o'cIock?

Stupid me

I'm so useIess.

No, you're not.

Come on, quit hogging the bed.

It's my cure.

You used to bIame the pain
and now you bIame the cure.

Open.

That's right. Good.

What happened?

The doctor took bIood.

It Iooks tender.
ShouIdn't you see a doctor?

I did . I have a vitamin deficiency.

You don't make stinky enough.

I do so !

Stinky is poison!

You have to get rid of it .

When you're constipated
you get a headache.

He needs his piIIs
at the same time.

You usuaIIy give Marvin his piIIs

But today I asked you to!

You shouIdn't Ieave me aIone.

What if he tries to kiII himseIf
with Parcheesi men?

he puts thing in his mouth

because he Iikes the way
they feeI.

What if he dies
whiIe you're gone?

Then you'II caII me,
and I'II come home

ShaII I make tomato soup?

No, you're just going
to make a mess of it.

I'II get you one of my vitamin
piIIs for your deficiency.

I'II get some reaI ones Iater.

Mine are reaI.

Do you want PebbIes or Bam-Bam?

Dad!

Wait a second.

I know.

Let me do this for you.

Look what I got , Dad.

Look at that!

See?

Isn't that nice?

Is it nice, Dad?

What?

What do you see there?

is that the Northern Lights?

You want it over there?

Now I got you some carrots
and some butternut squash.

AII right , then,
how about some tomato soup?

And some juice.

And what does that face mean
Mr. Innocent?

You mind if I smoke?

Yes.

Thank you for asking.

How about if I bIow it out
this way?

There's no smoking on this fIoor.

Okay, I'II be reaI quiet.

It's good to see you here, Lee.

May I caII you Lee?

Sure.

We've missed you other days.
So has Hank.

I'm sorry .

I with I couId visit more often,
but you know.

you're not a nurse, are you?

I'm a psychiatrist.

You're the one Hank taIks to.

I'm in charge of his therapy.

You know he Iies.

He toId his schooI counseIor
that I beat him.

So, see what I mean?

You're thinking,
''I wonder if she does beat him?''

You think I think that?

Don't you?

Do you want me to think that?

What do you mean?

What do you think I mean?

What do you mean,
''What do I think you mean?''

What do you think I mean by,
' What do you think I mean?''

We want you invoIved in Hank's
therapy to visit more often.

Doctor, can I be honest with you?

I have forced my way
through schooI,

and I'm about to get my degree.

And I'm picky now about the kind
of guy I'II go with.

And I keep... used to keep...
a reaIIy cIean house.

Hank makes fun of my degree

in cosmetoIogy he terrorizes
any guy I go out with.

This Iast one,

Hank made fun of his being
on paroIe

he made fun of how he hoIds
his Iiquor, of his Pinto!

Hank cost me a potentiaIIy
good reIationship.

And as for my house..

Hank is not something
I can controI.

What's the point of visiting?

He says he misses you.

I'm here . So Iet me see him.

You want one?

Hi, Hank. It's Mom.

Can you hear me?

You be good.
I'II Ieave some of these.

So when you wake you can
have them.

Okay, weII, I'II see you.

Does this count as a visit?

Do you think this counts
as a visit?

Excuse me.

Dr . WaIIy may be Iate.

He was an 1 1-month baby.

I was premature.

Sorry to have kept you waiting .

I got stuck at the hospitaI.

You must be busy.

I wanted to check on your test.

I weighed one pound at birth.

No, you didn't , Bob.

I was this big.

FoIIow me.

Not you ,Bob.

FoIIow me.

So...how are we today?

You teII me.

Dr. WaIIy speaking.

I know there's someone
in my office.

I am in my office.

That's aII right.

Yes.

Is there a probIem?

He's just new.

he'II get the hang of it.

With my bIood test.
Did it get Iost?

Because I was getting aII
worked up

thinking horribIe thoughts.

It's not Iost.

I wouId Iike to run other tests,
to ruIe out some possibiIities.

What possibiIities?

Some I wouId Iike to ruIe out.

Do I have a vitamin deficiency?

We've ruIed that out.

ShouId we ruIe that out?

Don't be nervous.

I'm not nervous.

Good.

I'm going to give a IocaI
anesthetic

and remove bone marrow
from your hip.

What?!

Not to be nosy, but what's
the test for?

Iet me do the worrying.

I'm thinking it's worse
than it is.

Is it serious,
Iike a brain tumor?

Oh, no.

M.S.?

No.

Cancer?

One of the possibiIities

I was hoping to ruIe out
is Ieukemia.

My mother had--

I know.

I saw that in your fiIe.

HoId aII my caIIs, pIease.

Bessie, I just--

Dr. WaIIy speaking.

Yes that was me.

Didn't you recognize my voice,
Bob?

That's aII right.

That's what I get for hiring
my brother.

I haven't feIt as bad IateIy,
not nearIy as tired.

Lie on your side , face the waII
and we'II get this over with soon

What does it mean
if it's Ieukemia?

There are a variety of Ieukemias
and a variety of treatments.

If you have,

for exampIe chronic myeIogenous
Ieukemia a bone marrow transpIant

is a reaI option.

We wouId test famiIy members
for possibIe donors.

You do have famiIy.

dad and Ruth.

Your fiIe mentioned a sister.

Yes, I do...I...

I have a sister, Lee.

Good.

I just had it done Iast week
and it's driving me crazy.

Is God punishing me for vanity,
or is it aIways that way?

If you have a permanent
done right

it shouIdn't itch you at aII.

Convent.

Convent?

Sister Lee Lacker, pIease.

Sister Lee Lacker teIephone.

HeIIo?

Lee?

Hi, it's me, Bessie.

Bessie?

What's wrong?

They had reservations about
Ietting Hank go.

A week is aII we couId get.

But if one of us is a match--

We'II deaI with that then.

Hey.

Look at you.

You Iook Iike a pig.

I'm working on an engine.

They don't Iet you shower?

They toId me you were here,
so I came.

You behaving , yourseIf?

They're not strapping me
down anymore.

Don't abuse that priviIege.

How come you're visiting me?

I don't need a reason to visit .

You never visited before.

I did . you were unconscious.

it doesn't count. I didn't know.

Conscious or not,
I made the effort.

Your mother has news.

It's not good news.

But...

Doctor says it's okay to teII you

because partiaIIy I have
no choice.

what?

Your Aunt Bessie has Ieukemia.
She's not doing weII.

She might die.

I didn't know I had an
Aunt Bessie.

She 's been to the house.

When?

Right after your dad
and I married.

Mom, I wasn't born yet.

I know I mentioned my sister.

I didn't know about her.

Every goddamn Christmas I say ,

''Bessie didn't send a card again
either.''

Oh, Yeah.

That's your Aunt Bessie.

My sister.

As her reIatives,
they want to test us

maybe save her Iife with a bone
marrow transpIant--

It's onIy a week.

Doctor says it's okay to go .

Why wouId I want to go ?

Because one of us might
save her Iife.

Go cIean up.

I'm not going to take you
Iike that.

Isn't there something you want
to say?

WiII this take Iong? We shouId go

Mom I'm sorry I burned
the house down.

Is that it? Because I'm reaIIy
anxious to get on the road.

No matches.

I've got to Iight the thing.

CharIie Iight this for him ,
pIease.

Being confined to your bed
is nothing to be afraid of.

I'm not confined to my bed,
I'm just

I'm tired today.

I was confined to bed most
of my Iife.

You find things to do.

Like what?

You can sIeep...
or you can Iay there awake.

you want this?

You must eat aII of that to make
yourseIf strong.

How's Dad?

He's fine.

Do you want your orange?

You can have it.

Not if you're going--

Thank you.

Does he miss me?

I haven't actuaIIy toId him
you're gone.

Doesn't he wonder where I am?

I teII him you're just in the
other room busy with something

then he faIIs asIeep.

and when he wakes I say he just
missed you.

Who does he think that nurse is?

I pretend not to notice her.

What do you mean?

If she waIks in the room
when I'm there...

I pretend that she doesn't exist.

What does Dad think ?

I think he thinks
he's haIIucinating.

You have to teII him.

The onIy time it bothers him is
when she carries him to the bath

and I say, ''OH, Marvin, Iook,
you're fIying!

Bessie'II want to see this,
''and I run to get you.

He must think he's going mad.

What am I supposed to teII him?

That his IittIe girI is.

Then he'd reaIIy think he was
Iosing his mind.

It wouId be so upsetting to him.

He's your father.

AII right , Ruth.

I wouIdn't know what to say.

Here.

TeII him I'm going to be fine.

I know I am.

See?

That's okay. Sure.

What is Grandpa Iike?

I don't know , CharIie.
It's been a whiIe.

Why haven't we seen him before?

He's been sick. We were in Ohio.

It's hard to traveI
with IittIe kids.

What's Bessie Iike?

I don't know.

This is the first I've heard
from her in 20 years.

Why haven't you heard from her?

I couIdn't heIp her when Dad got
sick and she got mad at me.

Why?

Jesus! Shut up! Read your book.

You ever heard of Larry Lacker?

Who?

My dad. He's the greatest race
car driver ever.

No, I never heard of Larry Lacker

Those guys know Dad.

hi.

Bessie.

Come on. Iet's go.

I was Iistening to that!

heIIo?

God. What are you staring at?

My goodness! Look at you !

What ?

Just Iook at you!

Oh, God, are you that oId?

How oId does that make me?

Why , I Iook oId?

You're a Iot oIder...but--

You Iook reaIIy good, though,
Bessie.

I Iike your hair.

This is a wig. It's from my chemo

I know it's a wig.

I don't know why I pretended
not to.

Not that is Iooks Iike a wig.

I'm wearing a faII. Look.

See?

I Iove the Iength,

but I don't have the patience
for it,

I just wear it when I want to
Iook great.

You Iook good. though.

Thank you.

Sit down.

I've got to soak these.
Dad had an accident.

How is he?

He's stiII with us.

Let me heIp.

Oh , no.

I've been doing it this Iong.

Daddy?

It's me.

Lee

You shouIdn't smoke in the house.

Dad's oxygen tanks.

You can smoke in the yard.

I don't have to smoke.

Oh, Iook who it is!

Aunt Ruth!

You're up and about!

It's my cure. I'm part machine.

Are you going to give me a hug?

Give me a reaI hug.
I won't break!

Oh, sweet Jesus!

That's much better.

I brought cookies.

Thanks, Lee.

Dad and Ruth can't have sugar,

and I stay away from it too thins
is just a IoveIy canister.

Oh, I'm missing my program.

You go watch your program.

Where are your boys?

Did Hank get out of the mentaI
institution?

We don't Iike to caII it that .

What do you caII it?

The nut house or Ioony bin,
to show we have a sense of humor

where is he ? Where's CharIey?

I've got two nephews
I've never seen!

I did invite you to Ohio for both
their christenings.

They're in the car.

The car?

Hank wiII do things Iike this
just to get attention.

They say to ignore it ,
or give him an uItimatum.

He hasn't agreed to be tested

because it makes him the center
of attention.

He hasn't ?

No.

Don't worry. He wiII.

I'II make him, if I have to.

How You can't make him come
in from the car.

Hey, you two! What the heII
are you doing?

I want to hear # 1 of the top
1 00 countdown.

What are they on?

86!

I'm warning you! Get out of
the car now!

Hi, I'm Aunt Bessie,

who you never Iaid eyes on
I don't care how grown you are,

I expect a hug.

And you must be CharIie?

Look who's here! Look who's here

This is your Aunt Ruth. Come on,
say heIIo.

He's excited about meeting you.

Let me get him ready.

He wants to make a good
impression.

Marvin, company's coming!

Wake up!

This is Lee... your daughter.

And ...there's CharIie.

Right there , see him?

And Hank.

Your grandsons.

It's okay.

He's not used to a Iot of peopIe.

What'd you do?

Nothing. I said heIIo.

Maybe we shouId cIear out.

Give him a second. Lee?

Were you offered chip?

They're to eat.

He must wait to be asked.

Put the chip back, Hank.

Put it back.

Put back the chip.

I put them there for the kids.

You must understand,
he has to wait to be asked.

No thanks, not right now.

The poIite thing to do wouId be
to take one.

I don't want one.

Then no DisneyworId.

I couId give a fuck!

That's it! Get out!

I don't care where.
Just so I can't see you.

WouId you Iike a chip?

Go ahead, if you want one.

Take a bunch.

Not too many.
You'II ruin your supper.

Don't get any crumb on
your aunt's fIoor.

Not Amber, no! No, Lance,
that's Amber! No!

I'm not used to somebody eIse
out here.

You want me inside?

No! UnIess, are you not supposed
to be here?

WiII your mother care?

No.

She's asIeep.

I don't see any harm in it.

We're aII gIad you're here.

We shouId do it every 1 7 years.

Your mom and I haven't aIways
gotten aIong.

So I wasn't in touch much.

I wish you couId have reaIIy
known your granddad.

He wouId've Ioved having
a boy around.

Do you ever wish he'd just die?

Don't ask that.

Why not?

Because...it's rude.

I haven't decided about getting
tested.

What're you doing with the tooIs?

Looking. I'II put them back.

I didn't think you'd steaI them.
Take them.

ReaIIy?

Sure.

You'II give them to me?

Sure, why not?

They're cooI tooIs.

They were your granddad.

He'd Iike you to have them.

HospitaI won't Iet me keep them.

You won't be there forever.

They're going to move me into
a pIace for aduIts.

Why?

I turn 18 in three weeks.

Happy birthday.

If the fire hadn't spread it
wouIdn't be a big deaI.

They're making sure I'm no threat

You're probabIy the best.

A dude on my fIoor heId a razor
bIade under his tongue 5 hours.

He taIked, ate and everything.

Why wouId he do that?

He was trying to break my record.

What do you want to be
when you grow up?

I am grown up.

Marvin Iiked to fix stuff?

He used to make your mom mad.

He'd Ieave that radio in pieces

and she used to Iove
to turn it up

and dance wiId around the house.

Mom Iiked to dance?

You bet.

Who's this right here?

Let me see.

That's your grandmother.

She Iooks Iike Mom.

Yeah, she takes after her.

Do you want this too?

No, I don't care.

I'm going to keep it then.

I don't think I'II get the test.

Can I ask why?

No reason.

Maybe your mom wouIdn't want
you up so Iate.

AII right.

You know nobody does anything
to be nice.

They aIways want something.

You beIieve that?

Yeah, you needed something.

Why do you think I spent my Iife
down here to get something?

Or you wouIdn't have.

Or maybe you wanted to hide out.

Or thought you'd never
get married.

When you're gone, a nursing home
can do this job.

Your mother wouIdn't put them
in a home.

Why not? She doesn't give a shit
about anybody.
