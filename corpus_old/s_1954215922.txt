Arkham Asylum.

Prison to the greatest supervillains
the world has ever known.

And Mr. Banjo.

Ever since the first
"Robot Chicken DC Comics Special",

#RCDC

Humanity has been safe
from these deviants.

Until...

the night.

And now,
the Robot Chicken DC Comics Special 2

Villains in paradise.

#RCDC2VIP

Would you like to buy
some girls scout cookies?

No!

Okay. Thanks, mister.

But Bizarro... said no.

Oh, this commute is murder.

Okay.

Let's do this!

Get aw...

Ow! You little vampires.

Oh, my moccasin.

Oh, no, not again!

No, no!

Just be gentle, Mr. Snappy.

What is wrong with this piece of shit!

Swipe it slower.

Ah, that's to slow.

Is it facing the right way?

Of course it's facing the right...

Okay, it was not.

Dad, this is total bull crap.

It's Spring Break.

My boyfriend invited me
to his family's place at the beach.

Well, the court says I get you
on weekends and holidays.

Like it or not,
we're spending this time together.

Doing what?

Oh, I have a plan for you.

Give me a double espresso latte,

half decaf, medium foam,
with a dusting of dutch chocolate.

That bald son of a bitch.

Does Weather Wizard want coffee?
I texted him.

I think he's responding because those
three dots are hovering right there.

Tall caf√© latte, please.

Okay, that's $3.95.

You didn't ask me
if I wanted whip or no whip.

Do you want whip?

Whip.
Great.

Do I want an extra shot of espresso?

I don't know. Do you?

We'll see.

Oh, sorry. Hold on.

It's... It's in my keys.

It's in my keys.

It's on the house, okay.

Free or not free
has nothing to do with it.

I don't know if I want it.

Only the coin knows if I want it.

hang on.

Oh, come on.
The Wi-Fi password doesn't work.

Aren't you a living supercomputer?

Use the Wi-Fi in your brain.

I don't have Wi-fi.

I have 3G.

And I'm locked in a shitty family plan.

Mom blows through all my data netflixing episodes of "Castle".

I have no minutes ever.

Ever!

Working here on your Spring Break?
That's total bull crap, Lena.

Yeah.
Well, tell that to Daddy War-Bald.

"Daddy War-Bald"!

We... We should follow
each other on Twitter.

Damon Lindelof
favorited my tweet once.

So, Lena over there
has to work on Spring break.

Did you even know it was Spring break?

What does it matter?
We don't get vacations.

That's what I told Lena!

She says that's so unfair.

Lena makes a lot of good points.

Oh! And you know she's vegan?

I really admire that Lena.

Weather Wizard wants an Americano.

Say we already left.

I'd like to introduce you to Superboy.

My, Uh... My clone.

What up?

"Clone"?

I knew you wouldn't have
the guts to tell them the truth.

I never should have had your baby.

That's what I've been telling you
for 16 years.

That's right, a clone!

A clone with no strings attached.

By sending a targeted energy pulse
from our stealth drone,

we will deactivate
the Justice League's power generator,

housed in the south quadrant
of the Hall of Justice,

rending those hapless heroes
completely defenseless and...

We're in the middle of a meeting!

Do you fools want to tell me
what's so important?

Well, if you insist.

Welcome to the 1986
Smallville High School talent show!

My name is SexyLexy
and we are Sexx Luthor!

Turn it off.

Oh, baby, baby,
with that ass so sweet.

We're the brainy studs
that you're dying to meet.

Sexx Luthor!

Sexx Luthor!

Come on! Lana Lang,
Lana Lang with that sweet ponntang

I wrote you a song,
now shake hands with my wang.

Sexx Luthor!

Sexx Luthor!

I said turn it off.

Just made it my ringtone.

I had a great time tonight, Iris.

Reverse-Flash!

You're not the only one
who's good with ladies, Flash.

Feast your eyes on Revers-Iris.

My name is Tina.

Up, up and away!

Uh, don't you think
you should sit down?

'Cause I'm gonna flying really fast.

I just think it would be safer.

I just...
Isn't there another shape?

Couldn't you make it more... vehicular?

Why?

Look, it doesn't  matter.
Let's... Let's just go in the ball.

Oh, because it's emasculating.

Oh, boy. You're one of those "Just put
it right out there" guys, aren't you?

Yes! It is emasculating.

It is emasculating to show up

with no superpowers
in a lime-green safety bubble!

Oh. Well, no,
let's talk about this for a second.

Earlier, you said
"something more vehicular".

Like a plane?

Sure
Okay, yeah. No, jet or prop?

Oh, a big prop plane, for sure!

And while you guys
are fighting the robot,

I'll get in a dogfight with Snoopy.

Let's just go!
I am sorry I ever said anything.

Look, I'm not gonna fly you
in the bubble.

I know you hate it,
and that's all I'll be thinking about.

There does come a time

when you must unwind.

And it's just the wind

and your superfriends.

Be set free.

Upon the sea.

And you're with your superfriends

until the super end.

Just sailin'!

Sailin'!

Sailing!

Sailing!

I... I got to call my dad.

...Which will bump Eddie's plan
to the end of march,

but I don't think anyone loves
"Malcolm in the riddle" anyway.

All in favor?

All in favor?

Okay, what's the problem?

You're working us
to the bone, Luthor!

We've butt-polished these seats
into reflective surfaces.

I pulled a chair
for Grodd the other day

and got into a staring contest
with his brown eye!

Why don't we get vacations?

Vacation!

Vacation!

You idiots have plenty of time off.

It's called prison.

Luthor is correct!

I, Starro The Conqueror,
require no vacation.

Why when I'm defeated
by the Justice League,

I'm back to business the next day.

I was at the drawing board,
not the shuffle board.

I... Uh, hey, where we going?

Oh, two guys taking a leak.
All right, well, it's odd...

We're on the same page,
right, guys?

You shouldn't flush those things.

That's how New York
got giant alligators in the sewers.

That's just an urban legend.

Oh, you think so?

Moving on a new business...

I have four mochas,
two whipped, two naked.

What? My daughter Lena
is supposed to bring the coffee.

Who the fuck are you?

That's my nephew Calvin, isn't he great?
Trying to help my sister out.

I'm taking Lena shift while
she's on vacation with her boyfriend

Lena does what she wants.

No!

This insubordination will not stand!

Well, you heard him. Go. It's over.
I tried, but it didn't work out.

It is what it is, okay?
Tell sis I love her.

What? What are you looking at.
Get the fuck out of here.

Brainiac, tap into the grid!

We'll cross-reference the database
of every airline in the country until...

Lena's Instagram is blowing up
with vacay pics!

That beach house looks amazing!

Grodd, cross your legs,
I can see your dick.

Lena thinks she can defy me?

You all wanted a vacation?

Well, the Legion of Doom
is going to the beach.

Flight mode engaged.

What?

The Hall of Doom... It flies.

Meow! We've been commuting
to the Okefenokee swamp

when we could have been
anywhere else? Meow!

I wear fucking burlap, man,

and the 20 pound of swamp water
it takes on every morning!

I have a case of trench foot
that's marched halfway up my balls!

Buckle up!

This bastion of evil upsets
the delicate balance of the green.

You were right to summon me,
the Swamp Thing,

for I am your protector.

Do you smell gasoline?

Shit! Shit!
This thing's taking off!

Get the fuck out of my way!

No!

"The death of Swamp Thing"

The most shocking comic book
of the year, now on sale!

He's back and better than ever!

"Swamp Thing" #1!
Now back to our show.

Green Arrow to tower.

The turbulence knocked the pilot
out cold! I'm all alone up here!

Easy, India Juliet 32,
we can talk you down.

First, tell me what it says
on your altimeter.

I can't even see the altimeter.

I assure you it's there.
I know it's there.

I'm saying I can't see it!

If you're having trouble
identifying the altimeter,

you need to look it up
in the flight manual.

I can't read it! We're ejecting out
of this flying death box!

Fuel jettisoned.

Oh, fuck!

You know, I was just off
a very hard breakup,

but I have to say,
this actually feels...

Is there a doctor in the house?

Oh, right here! Dr. Fate.
He's a doctor.

I'm not... Uh...
I'm actually not that kind of doctor.

What? You lied to me.

I never meant to hurt you, Melanie!

Green Arrow
was the champion of justice,

but more importantly,
he was my friend.

And no amount of tears will...

Will...

No, you know what?
Fuck this!

Oh, don't act so shocked, you phonies

You know how this works.

In a few months, some magic amulet
will bring him back or...

we'll find some
alternate-dimension Green Arrow

that's exactly like
the one we had before!

How many of you here
have already died?

Come on! Put them up!

Exactly. So, all due respect to
Green Arrow or who ever bites it next,

But I'm done with your memorials,
your wakes,

or flying to your home planets
to scatter your fucking ashes!

I am done!

First day of my internship
at the Daily Planet.

Working at the Daily Planet is great.

Mr. Kent's really nice,
and Miss Lang gets all the scoops!

And if I ever get in hot water,
I can call Superman on my signal watch!

Good one, Jimmy!

Look, it's true!

No way!

I'll prove it, rookie!

Superman will catch me
before I even in hit the ground...

Is this your signal watch?

The bad news, Jimmy Olsen died.

The good news, I got promoted.

Come on, you stupid gorilla.

It's my first day.

Do something cool!

Help! Help me, Superman!

Jimmy?

Jimmy?

Jimmy!

What? why?

Look, Mr. Kent!

I got the front page
on my very first day.

Congrats.

So, what made you respond
to my profile?

Well, you said you liked fish.

So?

Ain't no poontang until date six,
and the edge grows wild, my man,

like Fangorn forest wild.

Hey, I just remembered I left
the ocean running, so...

maybe another time.

What a beautiful morning.

You're welcome.

You gonna make that joke
every fucking day, Weather Wizard?

Your power's not called "July"!

Hey, man, you're really sunburned.

You should go inside.

This is my natural skin tone.
You know what? Mind your own business.

Okay, all right.

Cute mermaid, girls.

Damn cute.

Hey, here's $5.

Why don't you girls
go get yourself some ice cream?

Hey, there, baby.
From around here?

Clayface don't get to meet a lot of...

Hey, fellas, "Private beach"
is code for "Nude beach".

Keep your visibly-mangled and misshapen
sausage cock in your pants, Penguin.

Guys, at a nude beach...
Hey, that really hurt.

Guys, at a nude beach,
there's nude women.

Oh, my god!

What? Huh?
Dude, you got fried!

I told you, my skin is naturally...
Holy fucking shit!

Problem?
Oh, no.

Is it sunburn?

No, no. Nope.

I'm perfectly bronzed.

Hey, I think this guy is dead.

I think I finally comfortable
in my own skin.

So take off your mask.
Uh, no, no, no.

I'm a real "But-his-face".
There's no judgment here, Scarecrow.

We're all beautiful in our own way.

Look at those dudes' dicks!

Wait. So "private"
doesn't mean "nude"?

"Private" means "private".

What are you fools doing?

Where are your clothes?

What the hell kind of freak show
are you running here, Luthor?

I'm just here looking for my daughter.
Daddy?

Lena!

"Daddy"?

Lena, you are never to see him again.

No!

Conner, you are never
to see that girl again.

No!

Hey, a quarter.

No!

Oh, golly, superboy!

How'd you ever land a high-class
fucking trail like Lena Luthor?

Well, talking about teenagers having sex
would be cheap exploitation.

But singing about it
is another story.

I met Lena.
Went to a movie.

Fell for Conner.
I let him super do me.

We made out.
Started to bone.

You'd be surprised
what they've enhanced on this clone.

Super teens,
who cares what they mean?

When all you need are super nights.

Give us dirt! Give us dirt!

Did you find out their scheme?

Give us dirt! Give us dirt!

Does his dick shoot red beams?

Good thing my panties are 10% lead.

And she's no stranger
to dicks with smooth heads.

Gross.

My super dad,
he'll get super mad.

But it's worth it for those super...

Nights!

I let you finish that song
as a professional courtesy.

That was a mistake.

Lena, you're to good
for that super-trash.

My clone's to good
to date a filthy Luthor!

Lena's got more class
in her little finger than you...

I'm cool, I'm cool.

Silence, fools.
It's over.

Slut, she's a slut.

Oh, you!

Oh, hell, no!

Check me out now, mother fuckers!

It's Starro!

Like a mighty New York City
sewer alligator!

I'd hate to say I told you so.

That is a lie.

I tol...

Only our combined forces
can defeat a foe that size.

All right, Luthor.
I'll bring my super-strength,

laser eyes,
invulnerability, and super-speed,

and you bring your slightly
above-average intelligence.

You know what?
Fuck you, Superman!

I've got this one, Mr. J!

No!

"Death of the Joker", now on sale!

Collect all 18 variant covers!

I got mine!

Hey, Sinestro, you remember
your lantern corps basic training?

The old bow-and-arrow maneuver?

You idiots!

This parasol's more
than just a fashion statement.

Sorry! Sorry!

Riddle me this!

Can anybody here me?

Riddle me this!

It's time Starro learn
that speed kills!

Sorry! Sorry!

I got this, guys!

Maybe I can turn the tide of this battle
with the aid of my ocean friends!

Aquaman calls us,
the horses of the sea, to fight!

So if any of ye wishes to leave,
go now,

and let no seahorse
hold in judgment he that does!

You are free...

all of ye...

to do as you choose.

Aye, lads.

Even Slow-witted Steve stayed.

And Crippled Kevin.

Kevin, whose tail
was gripped by a crab.

Look upon one another

and know that on this day,
ye all chose

to fight for the one in tight-green
leggins and orange shirt,

the one who sometimes carries a trident
but mostly no,

the one with the locks of gold
fairer than any maiden!

We fight for the one they call

Aquaman!

So, ride the currents as though
your tails were set alight,

for your names shall be remembered

from this day and forevermore!

For Aquaman!

If this is the end,

I want to die here,

In your arms

among all these dead seahorses

For Aquaman!

So many dead seahorses.

I love you.

I love you!

Could it be?

True love has touched
even this old starfish's heart?

We have no reason to fight,
my friends!

Smile, you son of a bitch!

Sailin'

Sailin'

I guess we learned
something here today, Luthor.

Indeed, we have.
For all our combined powers,

we were fools to think we could defeat
the greatest power of the universe...

love.

It's so beautiful.

It's a little gross.

The bride and groom will now read
the vows they have written.

When I met Lena...

I never realized one person
could teach me so much about life

and love and following
my own passion.

That's how I finally find
the courage to ask...

Bizarro, will you marry me?

And... and Bizarro say yes!

Oh! This is beautiful.

Bizarro say yes!

Yes!

Yes! Yes!

A thousand times yes!

You may now kiss the bride.

Yes! Me want kiss!

Yes! Yes!

This is how we're ending the second
"Robot Chicken DC Comics Special",

with a bullshit fake-out wedding?

Damn it! Aren't you dead?

Oh, I got the magic amulet.

Drop your dicks and grab your flip-flops.

We are Sexx Luthor!

Oh, baby, baby!
With that ass so sweet.

We're the brainy studs
that's your dying to meet.

Sexx Luthor!

Sexx Luthor!
