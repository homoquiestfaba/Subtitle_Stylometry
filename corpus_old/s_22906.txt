 Is to love rendering aen


 The World has changed...

 Han mathon ne nen

 I feel it in the water...

 Han mathon ne chae

 I feel it in the Earth...

 A han nostron ned wilith

 I smell it in the air...

 Much that once was is lost,

 for none now live



 It began with the forging 
 of the great Rings...

 Three were given to the Elves
 inmortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

 Seven to the Dwarf Lords...

 Great miners and craftsmen 
 of the mountain halls

 And nine...

 Nine rings were gifted 
 to the race of Men...

 who above all else desire power

 For within these Rings was bound 
 the strength and will to govern each race.

 But they were all of them deceived...

 for another ring was made

 in the Land of Mordor

 in the fires of Mount Doom

 The Dark Lord Sauron...

 forged in secret a Master Ring

 to control all others

 and into this ring he cored his cruelty, his malice,
 and his will to dominate all life...

 One Ring to rule them all.

 One by one,

 free lands of Middle Earth 
 fell to the Power of the Ring.

 But there were some

 who resisted...

 A last Alliance of Men and Elves 
 marched against the armys of Mordor...

 and on the slopes of Mount Doom

 they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth.

 Victory was near

 but the power of the ring 
 could not be undone...

 It was in this moment...

 when all hope had faded...

 that Isildur, son of the King 
 took up his father's sword.

 "Sauron" 
 the enemy of the free peoples 
of Middle Earth

 was defeated

 The ring passed to Isildur,

 who has this one chance
 to destroy Evil forever

 but the hearts of the men 
are easily corrupted

 And the ring of the power...

 has a will of its own

 It betrayed Isildur,

 to his death

 And some things
that should not have been forgotten

 were lost

 History became legend...

 Legend became myth...

 and for 2,500 years

 the ring passed out of all knowledge.

 Until

 when chance came

 it ensnared a new bearer

 My precious... my own...

 The ring came to the creature Gollum,

 who took it deep into the tunnels 
 of The Misty Mountains,

 and there it consumed him

 It came to me, my own!

 My love, my precious!

 The ring brought Gollum 
 unnatural long life

 For 500 years

 it poisoned his mind,

 and in the gloom of Gollum's cave it waited. 
 Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

 Rumor grew of a shadow in the East,
 whispers of a nameless fear,
 and the Ring of Power perceived that its time had come

 It abbandoned Gollum

 but something happenned then

 the ring did not intend.

 It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable

 A Hobbit... Bilbo Baggins,

 of the Shire

 Lost!

 I lost my precious!

 For the time will soon come

 when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all

 You're late!

 A wizard is never late,

 Frodo Baggins,

 nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.

 It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf

 You didn't think I'd miss 
 your Uncle Bilbo's birthday.

 What news of the outside world? 
 Tell me everything

 Everything? 
 You're far too eager and curious for a hobbit

 First and natural...

 Well, what can I tell you?

 Life in the wide world goes on, 
 much as it has this past age,

 full of its own comings and goings, scarcely aware

 of the existence of the Hobbits

 For which I am very grateful

 Ah... the long expected party...

 How is the old rascal?

 I hear it's going to be a party 
 of special magnificence

 You know Bilbo 
 He has the whole place in an uproar

 - That's a pleasant 
 - Half the Shire has been invited

 - Goodness 
 -He's up to something.

 All right, then keep your secrets

 Before you came a long way, 
 Bagginses were very well thought of

 - Indeed 
 - Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected

 If you're referring to the incident with the dragon,

 I was barely evolved

 All I did was give your uncle 
 a little nudge out of the door

 Whatever you did 
 You've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace

 Gandalf, Gandalf!

 Fireworks!

 Gandalf! Gandalf! 
 Fireworks! Gandalf!

 Gandalf, I'm glad you're back

 So am I, dear boy

 So am I...

 No, thank you!

 We don't want any more visitors, 
 well-wishers or distant relations!

 And what about very old friends?

 Gandalf?

 Bilbo Baggins

 My dear Gandalf!

 Good to see you...

 One hundred eleven years old 
 Could you believe it?

 You haven't aged a day

 Come on, come in!

 Welcome, welcome!

 Tea? or maybe something a little stronger?

 I've got couple of bottles of the Old Winyards left 
 1926. Very good year!

 Almost as old as I am!

 It was laid down by my father 
 What say we open one?

 Just tea, thank you!

 I was expecting you last week,

 but you come and go as you please

 thus to be always

 I am afraid that badly I am prepared

 single we have chicken fried and cucumbers

 is a little cheese and 
 is not sufficient

 we have frambuesa jelly, apple pie

 but I am afraid that 
 are no great desserts we do not have sufficient

 I found a little spongy pie

 I can make you some eggs if you like... Gandalf?

 Just tea, thanks!

 Ah, right!

 You don't... if...

 No... not at all!

 I'm not at home!

 I've got to get away from 
 these confounded relatives!

 Hanging on the bell all day 
 never giving me a moment's peace!

 I want to see mountains again, mountains! Gandalf

 And then find somewhere quite 
 where I can finish my book.

 Oh! Tea!

 So you mean to go through with your plans?

 Yes, Yes!

 All the arrangements are made.

 Open it

 - Frodo suspects something! 
 - Of course he does! He's a Baggins!

 Not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle!

 You will tell him, won't you?

 Yes, yes!

 He's very fond of you

 I know

 He'd probably come with me 
 if I asked him

 I think in his heart 
 Frodo's still in love with the Shire

 The woods... and fields... little rivers

 I'm old Gandalf!

 I know I don't look it, 
 but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart

 I feel thin!

 Sort of stretched like... 
 butter stretched over too much bread!

 I need a holiday!
 A very long holiday...

 And I don't expect I shall return

 In fact I mean not to.

 The old toby, 
 the finest weed in the south farthing

 Gandalf my old friend 
 this will be a night to remember

 Fat Golberg, glad to see you

 welcome, welcome!

 Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance

 Uhmm... I think I'll just have another ale!

 No, you don't

 Go home

 So there I was...
 at the mercy of 3 monstrous Trolls

 And they were all arguing amongst themselves 
 about how they were going to cook us

 Whether they would mince us, or sit on us, 
 and squash us to jelly

 they spent so much time arguing that 
 how and because

 And they spent so much time arguing, 
 that sunlight crept over the top of the trees...

 And turned them all to stone!

 Quick!

 Oh! Off we go!

 No, no! The big one, big one!

 - Done!
Ypu're supposed to stick it in the ground!

 - It is in the ground!

 - Outside 
That was your idea!

 Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

 Dragon?

 Nonsense, there hasn't been a dragon
  in these parts for a thousand years!

 - That was good 
 - Let's get another one!

 Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took

 I might have known

 Speech, Bilbo! Speech!

 Speech!

 My dear Bagginses, and Boffins...

 Tooks and Brandybucks

 Grubbs! Chubbs!

 Hornblowers! Bolgers!

 Bracegirdles! Proudfoots!

 Proudfeet!

 Today is my 111 birthday!

 Happy Birthday!

 Alas. Eleventy-one years 
 is far too short a time 
 to live among such excellent,

 admirable Hobbits!

 I don't like

 half of you half as well as I should like,
 and I like

 less than half of you half as well as you deserve.

 I have things to do...

 I've put this off far too long

 I regret to announce this is the end!

 I'm going now

 I bid you all a very fond farewell

 Good bye!

 - I suppose you think that was terribly clever
 - Come on, Gandalf!

 Did you see their faces?

 There are many magic rings in this world, Bilbo Baggins 
 and none of them should be used like that!

 It was just a bit of fun! 
 Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

 You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?

 Two eyes, as often as I can spare them

 I'm leaving everything to him

 And what about this ring of yours?
 Is that staying too?

 Yes, Yes!

 Take an envelope over there, on the mantlepiece

 No... wait it's...

 here in my pocket...

 Why... isn't that... isn't that odd, now

 Yes, after all, why not

 Why shouldn't I keep it?

 I think you should leave the ring behind, Bilbo

 Is that so hard?

 Well, no...

 and yes!

 Now it comes to it

 I don't feel like parting with it, it's mine! 
 I found it! It came to me!

 - There's no need to get angry
 - Well if I'm angry, it's your fault!

 It's mine!

 My own

 My precious

 Precious? It's been call that before

 But not by you

 Oh, what business is it of yours 
 what I do with my own things!

 I think that you have that ring quite long enough!

 You want it for yourself!

 BILBO BAGGINS!! Do not take me for 
 some conjuror of cheap tricks!

 I'm not trying to rob you!

 I'm trying to help you

 All your long years, we've been friends

 Trust me, as you once did

 Let it go!

 You're right, Gandalf

 The ring must go to Frodo.

 It's late 
 The road is long

 Yes, it is time

 Bilbo,

 the ring is still in your pocket

 I've thought of an ending for my book:

 And he lived happily ever after,

 to the end of his days.

 And I am sure you will, my dear friend

 Good bye, Gandalf

 Good bye, dear Bilbo

 Until our next meeting...

 It's mine... my own...

 my precious...

 Riddles in the dark.

 He's gone, hasn't he?

 He talked for so long about leaving 
 I didn't think he'd really do it.

 Bilbo's ring

 He's gone to stay with the Elves

 He's left you Bag End

 Along with all his possessions

 The ring is yours now

 Put it somewhere out of sight

 - Where are you going?
 - There are some things that I must see to

 - What things?
 - Questions...

 Questions that need answering

 But if you've only just arrived!
I don't understand

 Neither do I

 Keep it secret 
 Keep it safe

 Shire!

 Baggins!

 Year 3434 of the Second Age... 
 here follows the account of Isildur...

 high King of Gondor 
 and the finding of the Ring of Power

 It has come to me, the One Ring

 which shall be an heirloom of my kingdom

 All that will follow in my bloodline 
 shall be bound to its fate

 for I shall risk no hurt to the ring!

 It is precious to me...

 though I abide with a great pain

 Markings upon the band begin to fade

 The writing wich at first was as clear

 as red flame, has all but disappeared

 a secret now that only fire can tell

 Shire!

 Baggins!

 It's no Baggins around here!

 They're up in Hobbiton

 That way!

 Is it secret?
 Is it safe?

 What are you doing?

 Hold out your hand, Frodo!

 It's quite cool

 What can you see?

 Can you see anything?

 Nothing!

 There's nothing!

 Wait...

 There are markings

 It's some form of elvish, I can't read it

 There are few who can

 The language is that of Mordor, 
wich I will not utter here!

 Mordor...

 In the common tongue it says:
 "One ring to rule them all

 One ring to find them

 One ring to bring them all

 and in the darkness, bind them!"

 This is the One Ring, 
forged by the Dark Lord, Sauron...

 in the fires of Mount Doom...

 taken by Isildur, from the hand of Sauron himself!

 Bilbo found it... in Gollum's cave

 Yes... for 60 years the ring layed quite...

 in Bilbo's keeping... 
prolonging his life... 
delaying old age...

 but no longer Frodo

 Evil is stirring in Mordor

 the ring has woken, 
it's heard its Master's call

 But he was destroyed!
Sauron was destroyed!

 No, Frodo

 The spirit of Sauron endured

 His life force is bounded to the ring,

 and the ring survived

 Sauron has returned, 
his orcs have multiplied...

 His fortress of Barad-Dur is rebuilt
in the land of Mordor

 Sauron needs only this ring 
to cover all the lands on a second darkness!

 He is seeking it,

 all his thought is bent on it

 The ring yearns above all else 
 to return to the hand of its master

 They are one,

 the ring and the dark lord

 Frodo! 
 He must never find it!

 All right! we put it away

 We keep it hidden, we never speak of it again

 No one knows it's here... do they?

 Do they, Gandalf?

 There is one other who knew 
 that Bilbo had the ring!

 I've looked everywhere for the creature Gollum,

 but the enemy found him first!

 I don't know how long they tortured him for

 But amidst the endless screams and the babble, 
 they discerned two words:

 Shire!
 Baggins!

 That will lead them here!

 Who goes there!

 Take it, Gandalf! 
 Take it!

 - No, Frodo!
 - You must take it!

 - You can not offer me this ring! 
 I'm giving it to you!

 DON'T... tempt me, Frodo!

 I dare not take it,

 not even to keep it safe!

 Understand Frodo...

 I would use this ring from a desire to do good

 But through me, it would wield a power 
 too great and terrible to imagine

 But it cannot stay in the Shire!

 No!

 No, it can't!

 What must I do?

 You must leave. And leave quickly

 Where? Where do I go?

 Get out of the Shire. Head for the village of Bree

 - Bree... What about you? 
 - I'll be waiting for you 
 at the Inn of the Prancing Pony

 And the ring will be safe there?

 I don't know Frodo 
 I don't have any answers

 I must see the head of my order 
 He's both wise and powerful

 Trust me Frodo, he'll know what to do!

 You'll have to leave the name of Baggins 
 behind you, for the name is not safe outside the Shire

 Travel only by day, and stay off the road!

 I can cut across countries easily enough

 My dear Frodo...

 Hobbits really aren't basic creatures!

 You can learn all there is to know 
 about their ways in a month,

 and yet after a hundred years, 
 they can still surprise you

 Get down!

 Confounded old, Samwise Gamgee! 
 Have you been eavesdropping?

 I haven't dropped no eaves, sir, honest

 I was just cutting the grass under 
 the window there, if you follow me

 A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

 I heard raised voices!
What did you hear? SPEAK!!

 N-n-n-nothing important! 
 That is I heard a great deal about a ring,

 dark lord, and something about the 
 end of the world, but, please Mr. Gandalf,
 sir, please don't hurt me

 Don't turn me into anything... unnatural 


 No?

 Perhaps not

 I've thought of a better use for you

 Come along, Samwise, keep up

 Be careful, both of you

 The enemy has many spies in his service

 Birds, beasts...

 Is it safe?

 Never put it on. For the agent of 
 the Dark lord will be drawn to its power

 Always remember, Frodo. 
 The ring is trying to get back to its master

 It wants to be found

 This is it

 This is that?

 If I take one more step, 
 it'll be the farthest away from home 
 I've ever been

 Come on, Sam

 You remember what Bilbo used to say? 
 It's a dangerous business,

 Frodo, going out your door. You step out onto the road,

 and if you don't keep your feet, there's 
 no knowing where you might be swept off to

 Smoke rises from the mountain of Doom, 
 and the hour grows late,

 and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my council

 seeking my council

 For that is why you have come, is it not?

 - My old friend... 
 - Saruman!

 You are sure of this? 
 Beyond any doubt

 So the ring of power has been found

 All these long years, it was in the Shire, 
 under my very nose

 Yet you did not have the wits to see it

 Your love of the Halflings' leaf 
 has clearly slowed your mind

 ... enough time. Time to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

 Time?

 What time you think that we have?

 Sauron has regained much of his former strength

 He cannot yet take physical form, 
 but his spirit has lost none of its potency

 Concealed within his fortress, 
 the Lord of Mordor sees all

 His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh

 You know of what I speak, Gandalf

 A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame

 - The eye of Sauron 
 He is gathering all evil to him

 Very soon he will summon an army great enough 
 to launch an assault upon Middle Earth

 You know all this?

 How?

 - I have seen it 
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman

 Why?

 Why should we fear to use it?

 They are not all accounted for, the lost seeing stones

 You do not know who else may be watching

 The hour is later than you think

 Sauron's forces are already moving

 The nine have left Mordor

 The nine?

 They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's 
 eve, disguised as riders in black

 They've reached the Shire 
 They will find the ring, and kill the one that carries it

 Frodo!

 You do not seriously think that a hobbit 
 could contend with the will of Sauron?

 There are none who can

 Against the power of Mordor, there can be no victory

 We must join with him, Gandalf

 We must join with Sauron

 It would be wise, my friend

 Tell me, friend...

 When did Saruman the wise 
 abandon reason for madness?

 I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly,

 but you have elected a way of paying!

 Mr. Frodo! Frodo!

 - I thought I'd lost you 
 - What are you talking about?

 - It's just something Gandalf said 
 what did he say?

 "Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee" 
 And I don't mean to

 Sam, we're still in the Shire. 
 What could possibly happen?

 Frodo! Merry... It's Frodo Baggins!

 - Hello Frodo!
 - Get of him!

 What's the meaning of this?

 Hold these

 You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop

 Hey! You get back here!... 
 You get out of my fields

 I don't know why he's so upset

 It's only a couple of carrots 
 And some cabbages

 And then those empty bags of potatoes we left in last week

 And then, the mushrooms, the week before!

 Yes, Pippin, my point is, 
 he's clearly over reacting

 Run!

 Ahhh. Ohhh

 I think I've broken something

 Trust a Brandybuck and a Took

 What? It was just a detour. A shortcut

 A shortcut to what?

 Mushrooms!!

 that is mine!

 that is precious!

 is one good Sam here!

 I think we should get off the road

 Get off the road!

 QUICK!

 Silence!

 What was that?

 See anything?

 Nothing!

 What's going on?

 That black rider was looking for something.
 Or someone... Frodo?

 Get down!

 I have to leave the Shire

 Sam and I must get to Bree

 Right!

 Right... Buckleberry Ferry. Follow me.

 Hurry!

 Follow me!

 Run!

 Get the boats out!

 Frodo!

 Go!

 Hurry!

 Run!

 Jump Frodo!
... We go!

 How far to the nearest crossing?
 The brandywine bridge. Twenty miles

 What do you want?
 We're heading for the prancing pony

 Hobbits. Four hobbits! 
 What business brings you to Bree?

 We wish to stay at the inn. 
 Our business is our own

 Alright, young sir, I meant no offence

 It's my job to ask questions after nightfall. 
 There's talk of strange folk abroad

 Can't be too careful

 Excuse me

 Good evening, little masters!

 If you're seeking accommodation, 
 we've got some nice cosy, 
 hobbit sized rooms available... Mr...

 Underhill. My name's Underhill

 - Underhill... 
 - We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. 
 Can you tell him we've arrived?

 Gandalf?

 Oh, yes!
... I remember

 Elderly chap. Big grey beard, and pointy hat

 Not seen him for 6 months

 What do we do now?

 Sam, he'll be here. He'll come

 What's that?

 This, my friend, is a pint!

 It comes in pints? 
 I'm getting one

 You... already?

 That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived

 Excuse me. 
 That man in the corner. Who is he?

 He's one of them rangers. 
 Dangerous folk, they are, wandering in the wilds

 What his right name is, I've never heard, 
 but around here, he's known as Strider

 Strider

 Baggins?

 Sure I know a Baggins

 He's over there, Frodo Baggins!

 He's my second cousin once 
 removed on his mother's side and...

 and my cousin third quite distant...

 Steady!

 You cannot hide

 I see you

 You draw far too much attention to yourself

 Mr. Underhill

 What do you want?

 - There is sort of trinket you carry 
 - I carry nothing!

 Indeed. I can avoid 
 being seen if I wish

 But to dissapear entirely. 
 That is a rare gift

 Who are you?

 Are you frightened?

 Yes

 Not nearly frightened enough. 
 I know what hunts you

 Let him or I it will hurt, Strider!

 You have a stout heart for a hobbit

 But that will not save you 
 You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo

 They're coming

 What are they?

 They were once men. 
 Great kings of men

 Then Sauron the deceiver gave to them 9 rings of power

 Blinded by their greed, they took them without questioning,

 one by one, falling to darkness

 Now they are slaves to his will

 They are the Nazgul. Ring wraiths. 
 Neither living nor dead

 At all times they feel the presence of the ring

 Drawn to the power of the One

 They will never stop hunting you

 Where are you taking us?

 Into the wild

 How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?

 We have no choice but to trust him

 But where is he leading us?

 To Rivendell, Master Gamgee, to the House of Elrond

 Did you hear that? Rivendell 
 We're going to see the elves

 Gentlemen 
 We do not stop 'til nightfall

 - What about breakfast? 
 - You've already had it

 We've had one, yes 
 What about second breakfast?

 Don't think he knows about 
 second breakfast, Pippin

 What about elevensies? Luncheon 
 Afternoon tea

 Dinner? Supper. 
 He knows about them. Doesn't he?

 Pippin!

 The power of Isengard is at your command,

 Sauron, Lord of the Earth

 What orders from Mordor, my lord?

 - What does the eye command?
 - We have work to do!

 The trees are strong, my lord 
 The roots go deep

 Rip them all down!

 This was the great watchtower of Amon Hen

 We will rest here tonight

 These are for you, keep them close!

 I'm going to take a look!

 Wait here

 You want a tomato?

 What is doing?

 Tomatos, Sausages, golden bacon, 
 We kept a little to you

 - Stifle this, stupids!
 - Look at that, ash-gray in my tomatos!

 Go!

 Back you devils!

 Frodo!

 Strider!

 Help him Strider!

 He has been stabbed by a Morgul blade

 This is beyond my skill 
 He needs elvish medicine

 Hurry! We're 6 days from Rivendel 
 He'll never make it!

 Frodo, Frodo!

 Gandalf!

 Mr. Frodo!?
 He's going cold!

 Is he going to die?

 He's passing into the shadow

 He'll soon become a wraith like them

 They're close!

 - Sam, do you know the athalus plant?
 - Athalus? 
 - Kingsfoil

 - Kingsfoil, that's a weed 
 - It may help to slow the poison. Hurry

 What's this, a ranger, caught off his guard?

 Frodo!

 I am Arwen 
 I've come to help you

 Hear my voice 
 Come back into the light

 Who is she?

 She is an elf!

 He's fading

 He's not going to last

 We must get him to my father

 - I've been looking for you for 2 days
 - Where are you taking him?

 There are 5 wraiths behind you 
 Where the other four are I do not know.

 Stay with the hobbits 
 I'll send horses for you.

 I'm the faster rider 
 I'll take him

 What are they saying?

 If I can get him across the river 
 the power of my people will protect him

 I do not fear them

 Ride hard, don't look back

 What are you doing! 
 Those riders are still out there!
