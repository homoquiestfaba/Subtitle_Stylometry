&gt;&gt; â™ª ( O COME ALL YE FAITHFULL )

&gt;&gt; YOU THINK I WANT TO GO?

YOU THINK I'M HAPPY ABOUT
MISSING CHRISTMAS?

&gt;&gt; COULDN'T YOU PUT IT OFF UNTIL
AFTER CHRISTMAS?

THAT'S NOT EVEN TWO WEEKS.

&gt;&gt; THERE MAY NOT BE ANY JOBS
AFTER CHRISTMAS.

&gt;&gt; BUT IT'S SO FAR AWAY.

THERE MUST BE SOMETHING CLOSER.

&gt;&gt; I HAVEN'T WORKED IN FIVE
MONTHS, THERE ARE NO JOBS HERE.

AND WE CAN'T LIVE ON THE DAY
LABOR I GET.

I'M AFRAID OF LOSING THE HOUSE,
ANNIE, AND YOU'RE PREGNANT.

THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER MOUTH
TO FEED.

WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?

I TRIED EVERYTHING...

I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

&gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE TO GO, YOU HAVE
TO.

BUT I DON'T HAVE TO LIKE IT.

AND I'LL DO MY PART.

I'M GONNA TAKE IN LAUNDRY--
&gt;&gt; NO.

&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU DON'T APPROVE, BUT
WE NEED THE MONEY,

YOU JUST SAID SO.

AND THE RICH ARE STILL PAYIN'
TO HAVE PEOPLE DO THEIR WORK.

&gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD HAVE SOMEONE DOING
YOUR WORK FOR YOU.

&gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE WHAT I'VE GOT,
THANK YOU.

AND BERNICE WILL HELP OUT AT
HOME.

IT IS DIFFICULT TIMES, BUT WE'LL
ALL DO WHAT WE HAVE TO.

&gt;&gt; I WORKED FOR THAT COMPANY FOR
NINE YEARS.

EVERYTHING WE SAVED IS GONE.

IF I DON'T GET THAT JOB, WE'LL
HAVE TO MOVE TO A SMALLER PLACE,

ANNIE.

WE'LL HAVE TO GO BACK WHERE WE
STARTED....OR WORSE.

WE WORKED SO HARD.

WE PUT SO MUCH INTO IT.

&gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT EACH OTHER.

AND WE'LL GET THROUGH IT.

YOU'RE NOT TO WORRY.

&gt;&gt; BERNICE!

&gt;&gt; I'M COMING.

&gt;&gt; COME ON.

&gt;&gt; WELL, I'VE GOT SOME NEWS.

I'M GOING TO KANSAS CITY TO GET
A JOB.

IT'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY.

"MEN WANTED. JAMES RADIO
CORPORATION, KANSAS CITY,

MISSOURI. 600 SKILLED
ELECTRICIANS."

THAT'S ME.

"IMMEDIATE EMPLOYMENT."

WELL, THE HARD PART, THE PART I
DON'T LIKE...

WELL, I'M ALWAYS TELLIN' YOU TO
TELL THE TRUTH, AND...

NOW HERE I AM, STUCK WITH IT.

I'M AFRAID I WON'T BE HOME FOR
CHRISTMAS.

&gt;&gt; OH, NO!

&gt;&gt; YOUR FATHER GETTIN' A JOB
WOULD BE THE BEST CHRISTMAS

PRESENT WE COULD HAVE, REALLY.

OH, BERNICE.

&gt;&gt; BERNICE!

&gt;&gt; GO TALK TO HER, ANGUS.

GO ON.

&gt;&gt; ( knocking )
&gt;&gt; BERNICE?

SUDDEN ATTACK OF HOMEWORK?

&gt;&gt; IT'S THESE STUPID FRACTIONS.

I CAN'T GET THEM RIGHT.

&gt;&gt; BERNICE, I WOULDN'T GO IF I
DIDN'T HAVE TO.

AND WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER SOON,
AND I'LL WRITE TO YOU, YOU'LL

WRITE ME BACK--WE'LL BE
PEN PALS.

&gt;&gt; ( tearfully ): I DON'T WANT
TO BE PAN PALS.

YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO
UNDERSTANDS ME.

&gt;&gt; YOUR MOTHER UNDERSTANDS YOU,
TOO.

&gt;&gt; SHE DOESN'T LISTEN.

SHE PAYS MUCH MORE ATTENTION TO
LILLY AND JACK THAN SHE DOES TO

ME.

&gt;&gt; BERNICE... ( sighs )...

YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO
DO A THING BECAUSE THERE ISN'T

ANYBODY ELSE TO DO IT.

EVEN IF WE'RE SCARED.

AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS MOVIN'
TO KANSAS CITY, FOR ALL OF US.

WE ALL NEED TO BE BRAVE.

&gt;&gt; I'LL TRY.

&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU WILL.

NOW, I WANT YOU TO HELP YOUR
MOTHER WHILE I'M GONE.

&gt;&gt; I WILL.

&gt;&gt; AND LOOK AFTER YOUR BROTHER
AND SISTER.

&gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T WANT TO.

THEY DON'T LISTEN.

THEY NEED A...KEEPER.

&gt;&gt; ( chuckling )
ALL THE MORE REASON TO HELP.

ALL RIGHT?

NOW, COME ON, LET ME SEE YOU
SMILE.

&gt;&gt; I HATE THE WAY I LOOK.

&gt;&gt; OHH...

YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

YOU JUST DON'T SEE IT YET.

&gt;&gt; I AM NOT.

&gt;&gt; HEY, LOOK AT ME.

NEVER CONTRADICT YOUR FATHER.

( chuckling )

THAT'S-A GIRL.

&gt;&gt; â™ª IN DUBLIN'S FAIR CITY
â™ª WHERE THE GIRLS ARE SO PRETTY

â™ª IT WAS THERE I FIRST MET
â™ª MY SWEET MOLLY MALONE

â™ª AND SHE WHEELS HER WHEELBARROW
â™ª THROUGH THE STREETS BROAD

AND NARROW
â™ª CRYING, COCKLES AND MUSSELS

â™ª ALIVE, ALIVE-O
â™ª ALIVE, ALIVE-O

â™ª ALIVE, ALIVE-O
â™ª SINGING, COCKLES AND MUSSELS

â™ª ALIVE, ALIVE-O
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE AN ANGEL YOURSELF,

LILLY.

&gt;&gt; DO YOU WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER
ONE?

&gt;&gt; WELL, I WOULD, BUT I HAVE TO
GET READY.

YOU SHOULD BE SINGING IN A GRAND
HALL IN FRONT OF THOUSANDS AND

THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

&gt;&gt; OH, NO, I COULD NEVER SING IN

FRONT OF STRANGERS.

I DEFINITELY COULDN'T DO THAT.

&gt;&gt; ( chuckling )

&gt;&gt; WHEN I GROW UP, I'M GONNA
TAKE A TRAIN AROUND THE WHOLE

COUNTRY.

DO YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME?

&gt;&gt; I CERTAINLY DO.

&gt;&gt; YOU AND ME AND MAGIC DOG AND
HIS FRIEND REAL DOG.

&gt;&gt; WE CAN'T HAVE A DOG NOW,
JACK.

&gt;&gt; JUST A LITTLE ONE?

&gt;&gt; NO, NO, WE CAN'T.

&gt;&gt; HEY!

&gt;&gt; DADDY, COULD I HAVE A DOG FOR
CHRISTMAS?

&gt;&gt; DID YOU WRITE SANTA A LETTER?

&gt;&gt; I DID.

&gt;&gt; GOOD.

&gt;&gt; ONLY BABIES GET PICKED UP.

&gt;&gt; I'M NOT A BABY.

&gt;&gt; DADDY, COULD I HAVE A NEW

DRESS FOR CHRISTMAS THAT GOES
WITH MY AZURE BLUE EYES?

&gt;&gt; AND SO THEY ARE.

WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

I'LL SPEAK TO SANTA PERSONALLY.

&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT MY DOG?

&gt;&gt; THAT, TOO.

&gt;&gt; ANGUS, WE SHOULDN'T MAKE

PROMISES
WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS?

&gt;&gt; WHAT IF, WHAT IF.

WHAT IF PIGS HAD LIPS?

THEY'D SOUND LIKE THIS.

( sound effect )
WE'RE NOT GONNA LET THAT OLD

WINDBAG HOOVER GET US DOWN.

&gt;&gt; OKAY.

&gt;&gt; BERNICE, WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR
CHRISTMAS?

&gt;&gt; NOTHING I CAN HAVE.

&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU
DON'T ASK.

&gt;&gt; ANGUS, NO PROMISES.

&gt;&gt; ANNIE, I'M GONNA GET THIS
JOB.

&gt;&gt; I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE
NOT.

&gt;&gt; THIS IS AS CLOSE TO A SURE
THING AS WE'RE GONNA GET.

&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

&gt;&gt; MAYBE OLD WINDBAG HOOVER
COULD GIVE US SOME MONEY, THEN

YOU WON'T HAVE TO GO.

&gt;&gt; ( all laugh )
&gt;&gt; YOU ARE FUNNY.

&gt;&gt; WELL, JACK, I WANT YOU TO
KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS FOR ME.

&gt;&gt; I WILL.

&gt;&gt; THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

GO ON.

&gt;&gt; OFF TO BED NOW, JACK.

&gt;&gt; AND I EXPECT A NEW SONG WHEN
I GET BACK.

&gt;&gt; BYE, DADDY.

&gt;&gt; BYE.

&gt;&gt; ( sniffling )

( crying )
&gt;&gt; OHH....

DON'T GROW UP TOO MUCH WHILE I'M
GONE.

&gt;&gt; PLEASE DON'T GO.

&gt;&gt; SO SERIOUS ALL THE TIME.

DON'T WORRY SO MUCH.

&gt;&gt; I'M AFRAID WITHOUT YOU HERE.

&gt;&gt; HEY. I'LL BE WITH YOU IN YOUR
HEART.

THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

&gt;&gt; SWEETHEART, GO UP AND TAKE
CARE OF JACK.

MAKE SURE HE GETS HIS PAJAMAS
ON, WOULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

&gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO BE CAREFUL.

&gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

&gt;&gt; I WILL.

BUT I WON'T BE HAPPY...

UNTIL I SEE YOU AGAIN.

SOMETIMES I JUST GET SO
TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA

HAPPEN TO US.

I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULDN'T
CRY.

&gt;&gt; NOT TO WORRY, MY DARLING
WIFE.

I'LL GET THAT JOB, AND WE'LL BE
MOVING TO KANSAS CITY BEFORE YOU

KNOW IT.

I'M SORRY TO BE MISSING
CHRISTMAS, BUT...

BUT I'LL MAKE IT UP TO
EVERYBODY.

&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU JUST GO ON NOW,
'CAUSE I CAN'T STAND THIS.

JUST REMEMBER THAT I LOVE YOU.

&gt;&gt; AND I LOVE YOU, ANNIE FEAGAN.

LOVE THE SMELL OF YA.

&gt;&gt; WHAT CAUSED THE DEPRESSION?

WHO HAS SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT
THAT?

&gt;&gt; IT'S WHEN THE STOCK MARKET
WENT TOO HIGH AND THEN CRASHED.

&gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE OF THE DUSTBOWL,
TOO--PEOPLE CAN'T FARM, AND THE

FARMERS HAVE NO MONEY TO BUY
ANYTHING.

AND THERE ISN'T ENOUGH FOOD TO
EAT, TO IT COSTS TOO MUCH.

&gt;&gt; AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE
OUT OF WORK, SO THEY CAN'T BUY

THINGS ANYMORE.

&gt;&gt; MY MOTHER SAYS THAT HOOVER
CAUSED THE DEPRESSION.

&gt;&gt; IT MIGHT BE MORE HELPFUL TO
THINK THAT HE'S DOING EVERYTHING

HE CAN TO END IT.

THERE YOU ARE, ANDREW.

YOUR REPORT WAS FINE AS FAR AS
IT WENT, BERNICE, IT JUST DIDN'T

GO FAR ENOUGH.

YOU RAN OUT OF STEAM BEFORE YOU
GOT TO THE END.

&gt;&gt; WHAT CAN THE PRESIDENT DO,
MISS KNIGHT?

HE'S JUST ONE PERSON.

&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES IS THE MOST POWERFUL MAN

IN THE WORLD.

I WOULD THINK HE CAN DO
ANYTHING, IF HE DECIDES HE

WANTS TO.

&gt;&gt; ( bell rings )
&gt; DO YOU THINK YOUR FATHER'S IN

KANSAS CITY YET?

&gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS.

HE SHOULD BE BY NOW.

&gt;&gt; MY FATHER SAYS THERE AREN'T
ANY JOBS ANYWHERE.

&gt;&gt; MY FATHER SAYS IT'S A SURE
THING.

&gt;&gt; I WISH WE HAD THAT CHICKEN IN

EVERY POT PRESIDENT HOOVER
PROMISED, THEN HE WOULDN'T

HAVE TO BE AWAY.

&gt;&gt; MY DAD SAYS HOOVER DOESN'T
KNOW HIS YOU-KNOW-WHAT FROM HIS

ELBOW.

&gt;&gt; HERBERT HOOVER IS THE
PRESIDENT.

HE CAN DO ANYTHING.

&gt;&gt; CAN YOU COME OVER TO MY HOUSE
LATER?

&gt;&gt; MAYBE I'LL ASK.

&gt;&gt; MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU.

BYE, BERNICE.

&gt;&gt; BYE.

&gt;&gt; ( woman): PLEASE, DON'T DO
THIS.

I HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

&gt;&gt; ( man ): I'M SORRY, MRS.

RUMSEN, THERE'S NOTHING I CAN
DO.

&gt;&gt; BUT THIS IS MY HOME!

22 YEARS!

&gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE PAYMENTS.

THEY FORECLOSED.

&gt;&gt; GIVE ME MORE TIME. PLEASE!

&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT UP TO ME.

WE'LL TAKE YOU TO THE SHELTER.

YOU CAN STAY THERE A WEEK.

&gt;&gt; SHELTER?

( sobbing )

&gt;&gt; ( whistle blowing )
&gt;&gt; ( car horn honking )

&gt;&gt; PLEASE. PLEASE, SIR.

MY FAMILY'S GOING HUNGRY.

MY CHILD NEEDS MEDICINE.

&gt;&gt; SURE.

&gt;&gt; ( coins jingle )
&gt;&gt; I WISH IT COULD BE MORE.

&gt;&gt; BLESS YOU, SIR.

&gt;&gt; ( men talking )

&gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT LETTIN' ANYBODY
IN.

&gt;&gt; BUT WHAT ABOUT THE JOBS?

I'M A SKILLED ELECTRICIAN.

&gt;&gt; WE'RE ALL SKILLED
ELECTRICIANS HERE, PAL.

&gt;&gt; BUT THEY ADVERTISED JOBS.

&gt;&gt; SOME OF US HAVE BEEN HERE
ALL NIGHT.

&gt;&gt; STAY BACK! STAY BACK!

&gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN OUT HERE ALL NIGHT!

&gt;&gt; I WORKED NINE YEARS FOR THE
FORD MOTOR COMPANY!

I CAME ALL THE WAY FROM DETROIT!

&gt;&gt; NOBODY ASKED YOU TO.

I WANT YOU ALL TO GO HOME!

&gt;&gt; LOOK -- THERE'S AN AD!

"600 SKILLED ELECTRICIANS
WANTED, JAMES RADIO

CORPORATION."

&gt;&gt; THOSE JOBS WERE ALL FILLED
BEFORE THAT AD CAME OUT.

&gt;&gt; THEN WHY DID WE COME?

&gt;&gt; I CAME ALL THE WAY FROM
PITTSBURGH!

&gt;&gt; GO HOME!

THERE AREN'T ANY JOBS!

&gt;&gt; WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL SOMEBODY?

&gt;&gt; GO HOME!

&gt;&gt; LET'S GET HIM.

&gt;&gt; LOOK, HE'S BLEEDING!

&gt;&gt; ( sirens approaching )
&gt;&gt; HE DID IT!

THAT'S HIM!

HE IS THE ONE THAT DID IT!

&gt;&gt; NO, I--
&gt;&gt; HE DID IT!

&gt;&gt; â™ª DAISY, DAISY
â™ª GIVE ME YOUR ANSWER, DO

â™ª I'M HALF CRAZY
â™ª ALL FOR THE LOVE OF YOU

&gt;&gt; â™ª DAISY, DAISY
â™ª GIVE ME YOUR ANSWER, DO

â™ª I'M HALF CRAZY
â™ª ALL FOR THE LOVE OF YOU

â™ª IT WON'T BE A STYLISH MARRIAGE
&gt;&gt; ( knocking )

&gt;&gt; I'LL SEE WHO IT IS.

KIDS, GO ON UPSTAIRS AND START
YOUR HOMEWORK.

&gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING, MA'AM.

&gt;&gt; GOOD EVENING.

&gt;&gt; I'M LOOKING FOR MRS. ANGUS

FEAGAN.

&gt;&gt; I'M MRS. FEAGAN.

&gt;&gt; YOUR HUSBAND'S BEEN ARRESTED,
MRS. FEAGAN.

WE GOT A CALL FROM THE KANSAS
CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT.

&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
ARRESTED? FOR WHAT?

&gt;&gt; RIGHT NOW THE CHARGE IS
ASSAULT, MA'AM.

IT SEEMS HE HIT SOMEONE WITH A
CROWBAR.

IF THE MAN DIES, THE CHARGE WILL
BE CHANGED TO MURDER.

&gt;&gt; ( weakly ): MURDER.

OHH...

&gt;&gt; ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MRS.

FEAGAN?

IS THERE SOMEONE INSIDE WHO CAN
HELP YOU, MA'AM?

&gt;&gt; I--I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.

THANK YOU.

&gt;&gt; THERE'LL BE A TRIAL, MA'AM.

HE'LL BE NEEDING A LAWYER.

YOU CAN TELL HIM THAT YOUR
HUSBAND IS BEING HELD AT THE

TIDE COUNTY JAIL.

I'M SERGEANT ANDERSON FROM THE
SIXTH PRECINCT.

IF YOU COME BY TOMORROW, THERE
MIGHT BE SOMETHING MORE BY WAY

OF INFORMATION.

JUST ASK FOR ME, MA'AM.

GOOD EVENING.

&gt;&gt; ANGUS FEAGAN
WOULDN'T HARM A SOUL!

HE'S THE GENTLEST MAN I'VE EVER
KNOWN.

HE'S DECENT AND HE'S HONORABLE!

HE DIDN'T HIT ANYBODY!

IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

&gt;&gt; SORRY, MA'AM.

&gt;&gt; F-E-A-G-A-N.

I WANT TO TALK TO MY HUSBAND
ANGUS FEAGAN.

THIS IS THE TIDE COUNTY JAIL,
ISN'T IT?

YOU HAVE MY HUSBAND THERE,
ANGUS FEAGAN.

WELL, COULD I SPEAK TO HIM,
PLEASE?

WELL...

WILL YOU AT LEAST TELL ME IF
HE'S ALL RIGHT?

&gt;&gt; ( line disconnects )

&gt;&gt; â™ª BERNICE'S FATHER
â™ª IS A MURDERER

â™ª BERNICE'S FATHER
â™ª IS A MURDERER

â™ª BERNICE'S FATHER
â™ª IS A MURDERER

&gt;&gt; HE IS NOT.

HE IS NOT!

&gt;&gt; MY MOM SAID SO.

SHE HEARD IT ON THE STREETS.

&gt;&gt; WELL, SHE'S WRONG.

&gt;&gt; ARE YOU CALLING MY MOM A
LIAR?

&gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE LIAR.

&gt;&gt; THEN WHY IS HE IN JAIL?

&gt;&gt; STOP PICKING ON HER,

CHARLENE.

&gt;&gt; HE'S NOT IN JAIL.

HE'S IN KANSAS CITY.

&gt;&gt; HE IS TOO IN JAIL.

YOUR FATHER IS A MURDERER.

BERNICE'S FATHER IS A MURDERER!

â™ª BERNICE'S FATHER
â™ª IS A MURDERER

&gt;&gt; HE IS NOT!

TAKE IT BACK!

MY FATHER IS NOT A MURDERER!

&gt;&gt; ( both yelling )
&gt;&gt; STOP IT!

CHARLENE, STOP IT!

&gt;&gt; BERNICE, STOP IT!

I CAN'T LEAVE YOU CHILDREN ALONE
FOR A MINUTE!

&gt;&gt; DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH
TROUBLE IT WAS FOR ME TO COME

DOWN HERE?

I HAD TO LEAVE MRS. FINCH'S
LAUNDRY AND NOW I'LL BE LATE

WITH IT.

WHAT POSSESSED YOU TO ATTACK
THAT GIRL?

&gt;&gt; SHE CALLED MY FATHER A
MURDERER.

&gt;&gt; THAT'S NO EXCUSE FOR
FIGHTING.

&gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

&gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOUNG LADIES DON'T
FIGHT.

THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DEAL
WITH PEOPLE.

&gt;&gt; I WON'T LET ANYONE CALL HIM A
MURDERER!

&gt;&gt; YOU WILL BEHAVE YOURSELF IS
WHAT YOU'LL DO, AND YOU WILL

LEAVE YOUR FATHER TO ME.

IS THAT CLEAR?

&gt;&gt; SHE CALLED MY FATHER A
MURDERER.

WHY ARE YOU SO MAD AT ME?

WHAT DID I DO THAT WAS SO
TERRIBLE?

&gt;&gt; I'M NOT MAD AT YOU, BERNICE.

&gt;&gt; YOU SURE SEEM LIKE IT
SOMETIMES.

&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

( sighs )
I'M JUST MAD AT THE WORLD FOR

THIS LOUSY DEPRESSION.

AND I'M MAD AT THOSE PEOPLE IN
KANSAS CITY FOR WHAT THEY'VE

DONE TO YOUR FATHER, FOR NOT
LETTING HIM GO.

AND I'M MAD BECAUSE I'M HAVING
TROUBLE FINDING A LAWYER TO HELP

HIM, AND I'M MAD AT MYSELF FOR
NOT BEING STRONGER.

&gt;&gt; I'M MAD, TOO.

&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU ARE.

AND YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE.

BUT YOU HAVE TO STAY OUT OF
TROUBLE AT SCHOOL, AND YOU HAVE

TO COME STRAIGHT HOME TO HELP
WITH YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER

UNTIL YOUR AUNT MARGARET GETS
HERE.

I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP NOW.

&gt;&gt; I WANT TO HELP GET DADDY
HOME.

&gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU DO, SWEETHEART.

BUT LET MOMMY TAKE CARE OF THAT.

YOU'RE NOT TO WORRY.

&gt;&gt; "DEAR FATHER, I MISS YOU SO
MUCH.

TODAY AT SCHOOL CHARLENE SAID
YOU WERE A MURDERER AND WE HAD A

FIGHT.

I TRIED TO BE NICE, BUT I
COULDN'T.

I GOT IN A COUPLE OF GOOD
PUNCHES BEFORE MISS KNIGHT BROKE

US UP.

AS PUNISHMENT, I HAVE TO WRITE
AN EXTRA REPORT ON PRESIDENT

HOOVER.

HE CAN DO ANYTHING HE WANTS TO,
YOU KNOW.

I WISH HE COULD HELP YOU GET
HOME.

I NEED YOU HERE."

&gt;&gt; THAT CHARLENE THINKS SHE'S SO
IMPORTANT.

YOU GOT HER GOOD.

&gt;&gt; IT'S TRUE MY FATHER'S IN
JAIL -- BUT HE SHOULDN'T BE.

HE DIDN'T EVEN HIT THAT MAN.

&gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO
HIM?

&gt;&gt; HE'LL GET OUT AND HE'LL COME
HOME.

&gt;&gt; HOW?

&gt;&gt; THEY'LL FIND OUT HE DIDN'T DO
IT.

&gt;&gt; WHAT IF THEY DON'T FIND OUT?

LIKE, WHAT IF THEY KEEP ON
THINKING IT'S HIM AND THEY NEVER

LET HIM GO?

&gt;&gt; ( man ): WE'VE GOT AN
EYEWITNESS.

&gt;&gt; THE MAN WHO DID IT RAN AWAY.

&gt;&gt; Y OU RAN.

&gt;&gt; I WAS AFRAID.

&gt;&gt; OF BEING CAUGHT?

&gt;&gt; NO, I--JUST AFRAID.

I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE STAYED--
&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME THE

NAME OF YOUR ACCOMPLICE.

&gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO ACCOMPLICE!

&gt;&gt; YOU DID IT ON YOUR OWN?

&gt;&gt; NO!

WHY WOULD I DO SOMETHING TO GET
MYSELF THROWN IN JAIL?

I HAVE A FAMILY.

LOOK.

LOOK!

THEY'RE NO SO DIFFERENT THAN
YOUR OWN.

&gt;&gt; THEY HAVE NO ONE ELSE TO TAKE
CARE OF THEM.

WAIT! PLEASE!

&gt;&gt; I NEED A CHANCE HERE!

HEY!

&gt;&gt; PLEASE LET ME FIND A WAY
TO HELP DADDY.

MOMMY CAN'T FIND A LAWYER, AND
SHE NEEDS HIM HOME.

SO DO I--AND SO DOES LILLY AND
JACK.

I CAN'T LET HIM STAY IN JAIL.

I HAVE TO FIND A WAY.

&gt;&gt; I BETTER GO DOWNSTAIRS AND
START DINNER AFTER THIS ONE.

&gt;&gt; NO, ANNIE.

YOU'VE WORKED ALL DAY LONG.

I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH IRONING.

LOOK, I'M HERE TO HELP YOU.

THAT'S WHAT SISTERS ARE FOR.

LATER I'LL GET THE DINNER
AND YOU CAN STAY UP HERE AND

REST.

&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA
DO, MAGGIE.

I'VE TRIED TO CALL HIM AGAIN,
AND THEY STILL WON'T LET ME TALK

TO HIM.

THEY WON'T EVEN TELL ME HOW HE
IS.

&gt;&gt; HE'S A STRONG MAN, HE'LL BE
ALL RIGHT.

&gt;&gt; BUT THE LAWYERS ALL WANT
THEIR MONEY UP FRONT.

I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA HELP
ANGUS.

&gt;&gt; EAT YOUR MEAT, JACK, IT'LL
MAKE YOU BIG AND STRONG.

&gt;&gt; MAGIC DOG DOESN'T LIKE IT.

&gt;&gt; WELL, MAGIC DOG DOESN'T HAVE
TO EAT IT--YOU DO. GO AHEAD.

&gt;&gt; THAT TASTES YUCK.

&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING IS YUCK RIGHT NOT,
BUT IT'LL GET BETTER.

&gt;&gt; I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN SAY
THAT, AUNT MARGARET.

NOT WHEN DADDY'S STILL IN JAIL.

&gt;&gt; I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN.

&gt;&gt; WHAT IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH?

WHAT IF THEY DON'T LET HIM GO?

WHAT THEN?

&gt;&gt; THEY'LL LET HIM GO.

I'LL FIND A LAWYER.

I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

AND I WANT YOU TO STOP THIS
RIGHT NOW!

&gt;&gt; NOTHING WILL BE RIGHT UNTIL
HE'S HOME!

&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA
DO WITH BERNICE.

&gt;&gt; SHE DOESN'T MEAN HALF OF WHAT
SHE SAYS.

IT'S JUST A STAGE.

&gt;&gt; I KNOW, I KNOW.

SHE'S STILL GROWING UP.

AND I NEED MORE PATIENCE.

BUT SOMETIMES SHE CAN JUST BE SO
STUBBORN.

&gt;&gt; LIKE SOMEONE ELSE I KNOW.

GIVE HER TIME TO FIND HERSELF.

EVERYTHING THAT'S GONE ON WITH
ANGUS...

&gt;&gt; YEAH.

I CAN'T STAND IT ANYMORE,

MAGGIE.

I HAVE TO KNOW THAT HE'S ALL
RIGHT.

I'M GOING TO THE POLICE STATION.

AND SERGEANT ANDERSON IS GONNA
GET THE POLICE IN KANSAS CITY TO

LET ME TALK TO MY ANGUS.

AND I'M GONNA STAY THERE UNTIL
THEY DO, I SWEAR IT!

&gt;&gt; GO IN THE MORNING, ANNIE,
AFTER YOU'RE HAD SOME REST.

&gt;&gt; NO. NO, I'M GOING NOW.

THEY'RE NOT GONNA KEEP ME FROM
MY HUSBAND.

&gt;&gt; ( Hoover on radio ):
I PROMISED YOU A CHICKEN IN

EVERY POT, AND I INTEND TO KEEP
THAT PROMISE. BUT IT WILL

REQUIRE YOUR CONTINUED FAITH.

IT WILL TAKE TIME AND BELIEF IN
THE SOUNDNESS OF THE AMERICAN

WAY OF DOING THINGS.

&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK HE CAN DO
ANYTHING?

&gt;&gt; I HOPE SO.

THERE'S SO MUCH THAT NEEDS
DOING.

IT'S BETTER TO THINK THAT HE CAN
THAN THAT HE CAN'T.

&gt;&gt; ... PROSPERITY IS JUST AROUND
THE CORNER.

&gt;&gt; HE'S THE PRESIDENT.

HE CAN DO ANYTHING HE WANTS TO.

&gt;&gt; ( playing piano )

&gt;&gt; LILLY.

&gt;&gt; ( coins jingle )

&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

&gt;&gt; GO BACK TO SLEEP.

&gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU DRESSED?

&gt;&gt; SHH! KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

I'M GOING TO HELP DADDY.

YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE AND TAKE
CARE OF JACK.

&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO TAKE CARE OF
JACK--I WANT TO HELP DADDY TOO.

&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU CAN'T.

&gt;&gt; ( crying )
&gt;&gt; AND DON'T CRY.

IT WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD.

&gt;&gt; WHY IS AUNT MARGARET PLAYING
THE PIANO SO LATE?

HEY! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

&gt;&gt; SHE'S GONNA GO HELP DADDY.

AND I'M GOING WITH HER.

&gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOT.

&gt;&gt; AND I'M COMING TOO.

&gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT OLD ENOUGH.

&gt;&gt; I AM SO.

I AM SIX, AND I CAN GO ANYWHERE
I WANT.

&gt;&gt; NEITHER ONE OF YOU IS GOING
ANYWHERE.

&gt;&gt; MAGIC DOG WILL TELL AUNT
MARGARET WHAT YOU'RE DOING IF

YOU DON'T TAKE US WITH YOU.

THEN NO ONE WILL GO.

&gt;&gt; YOU WOULDN'T DARE.

&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH?

&gt;&gt; JACK!

( sighs )
GET BACK HERE.

OKAY.

&gt;&gt; â™ª ( piano )

&gt;&gt; BERNICE, WHY ARE WE GOING TO
WASHINGTON?

&gt;&gt; TO SEE PRESIDENT HOOVER.

&gt;&gt; WHY? WHAT'S HE GONNA DO?

&gt;&gt; HELP US GET OUR FATHER OUT
OF JAIL.

&gt;&gt; LILLY.

&gt;&gt; JACK, YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE
ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO TELL THE

TRUTH?

&gt;&gt; THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

&gt;&gt; WELL, IF WE WANT TO SEE
DADDY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TELL

A SMALL LIE.

&gt;&gt; I DON'T MIND.

&gt;&gt; JUST DO EXACTLY WHAT I DO.

FOLLOW ME.

&gt;&gt; THANKS, YOU.

THANKS, MA'AM.

&gt;&gt; MY MOTHER IS ALREADY ONBOARD.

&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, GO ON.

&gt;&gt; MOTHER'S ALREADY ONBOARD.

&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

&gt;&gt; UH...

DO YOU KNOW WHERE MY MOTHER IS?

&gt;&gt; SHE'S ON BOARD.

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

&gt;&gt; ( train whistle blows )

&gt;&gt; WE'RE MOVING.

&gt;&gt; THAT WAS EASY.

&gt;&gt; WE'LL BE THERE IN NO TIME.

&gt;&gt; ( conductor ) THIS IS THE
TRAIN FOR COLUMBUS WITH

CONNECTIONS FOR OUR NATION'S
CAPITAL.

&gt;&gt; BERNICE, THAT'S HIM.

&gt;&gt; ALL TICKETS, PLEASE.

&gt;&gt; COME ON.

&gt;&gt; WE'RE GONNA GET IN TROUBLE.

&gt;&gt; STOP WHINING.

LET'S GO.

&gt;&gt; HEY, YOU KIDS.

HEY, I WANT TO SEE YOUR TICKETS.

&gt;&gt; WHAT DO WE DO NOW, BERNICE?

&gt;&gt; WE EXPLAIN THAT WE DON'T HAVE
ANY MONEY AND HOW IMPORTANT IT

IS THAT WE GET TO WASHINGTON.

&gt;&gt; ( boy ): HE'LL THROW YOU OFF
ANYWAY.

&gt;&gt; HUH?

&gt;&gt; QUICK, JUMP IN.

&gt;&gt; GO ON!

&gt;&gt; SHE'S HARD OF HEARING.

&gt;&gt; HURRY, LILLY.

&gt;&gt; OKAY, OKAY!

&gt;&gt; ( conductor ): HEY,
WHERE'D YOU KIDS GO?!

LITTLE BRATS.

WHAT THE--?

THEY HAD TO COME BY THIS WAY.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

&gt;&gt; IS HE GONE?

&gt;&gt; HE IS.

WHAT'D YOU DO, ROB A BANK?

&gt;&gt; WE CERTAINLY DID NOT.

&gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO WASHINGTON.

&gt;&gt; TO SEE WINDBAG HOOVER.

&gt;&gt; I SUPPOSE IT'S OKAY TO TELL
YOU--HE'S GONNA HELP OUR FATHER.

&gt;&gt; GOOD LUCK WITH THAT ONE.

I HEAR OLD HOOVER'S SO MEAN HE
WOULDN'T GIVE A STARVING MAN A

SKINNY PORK CHOP.

&gt;&gt; THAT IS NOT TRUE.

&gt;&gt; NOW, MY FATHER, THAT'S A
DIFFERENT STORY.

HE'LL GIVE YOU ANYTHING YOU
WANT.

HE'S A TYCOON, HE'S WORTH A
MILLION BUCKS.

I'M ON MY WAY TO SEE HIM RIGHT
NOW.

&gt;&gt; I'M VERY HUNGRY.

&gt;&gt; SO AM I.

CAN WE GET SOMETHING TO EAT NOW,
BERNICE?

&gt;&gt; I'M AFRAID WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY.

&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T NEED MONEY WHEN
YOU'RE TRAVELING WITH ME.

MY FATHER'S GOT AN ACCOUNT WITH
THIS RAILROAD.

&gt;&gt; ( door unlocks, opens )

&gt;&gt; OHH. I'M SORRY I'M SO LATE.

IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

&gt;&gt; YES. I PLAYED A WEE BIT OF
MOZART AND THEN I WENT UPSTAIRS

AND PEEKED IN ON THEM, AND THEY
WERE SLEEPING LIKE ANGELS.

&gt;&gt; I WAITED AND WAITED AT THE
POLICE STATION UNTIL THEY

FINALLY DECIDED TO CALL THE JAIL
IN KANSAS CITY, AND THE PEOPLE

THERE WOULDN'T EVEN PUT ANGUS ON
THE PHONE.

&gt;&gt; DID THEY TELL YOU ANYTHING?

&gt;&gt; THEY SAID HE WAS ALL RIGHT,
BUT I'LL FEEL BETTER WHEN I HEAR

IT FROM HIM.

I'LL HAVE TO GO LOOKING FOR A
LAWYER IN THE MORNING.

THAT FOREMAN IS STILL
UNCONSCIOUS, AND IF HE DIES,

THEY'LL BLAME ANGUS.

&gt;&gt; THEY'LL FIND OUT IT WASN'T
HIM AND THEY'LL LET HIM GO.

&gt;&gt; OHH...

&gt;&gt; IT'S LATE.

I'LL GO UP AND GET MY BAG, I
LEFT IT IN THE GIRLS' ROOM.

&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

I'LL MAKE UP THE COUCH.

&gt;&gt; I'LL DO IT LATER, ANNIE.

&gt;&gt; IT'S ALL RIGHT.

&gt;&gt; ( chuckling )
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE USED TO

SHARE A BED?

WE USED TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT
TALKING?

&gt;&gt; YOU ALWAYS SAID YOU WOULDN'T,
BUT YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?

GET US IN TROUBLE.

&gt;&gt; WE WERE GIRLS THEN, ANNIE.

&gt;&gt; SEEMS SO LONG AGO NOW,
MAGGIE.

ANOTHER LIFETIME.

&gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

HOW COULD THEY--?

OH, NO! ANNIE!

&gt;&gt; WHAT?

&gt;&gt; ANNIE!!!

&gt;&gt; WHAT IS IT?

&gt;&gt; ( train whistle blows )

&gt;&gt; OH, BOY, THIS IS GREAT.

&gt;&gt; IT'S A GOOD THING MY OLD MAN
HAS CONNECTIONS.

THE DINING ROOM IS CLOSED AND SO
IS THE KITCHEN, BUT THEY HAD TO

HELP ME OR I WOULD HAVE TURNED
IN THEIR NAMES.

&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?

&gt;&gt; NOT ME, THANKS, I'M FULL.

YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE DINNER
I HAD--THE WORKS.

BUT THANKS.

&gt;&gt; "DEAR MOMMY..."

&gt;&gt; "I'M GOING TO SAVE DADDY.

PLEASE DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME
AND PLEASE DON'T BE TOO MAD AT

ME.

I LOVE YOU, BERNICE.

P.S. JACK AND LILLY ARE COMING
WITH ME."

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

I DON'T KNOW HOW--
I'M SO SORRY, ANNIE!

&gt;&gt; WHERE WOULD THEY GO?

I MEAN, HOW CAN THEY HELP THEIR
FATHER, THEY'RE JUST CHILDREN!

I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE TO STOP
THEM!

&gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE AT
ONCE, ANNIE.

&gt;&gt; YES, I CAN, I HAVE TO.

I'M THEIR MOTHER.

&gt;&gt; I SPOKE TO A CLERK AT THE
TRAIN STATION, MA'AM.

HE SAID HE SAW THREE CHILDREN,
TWO GIRLS AND A BOY, BUT THAT HE

TOLD THEM TO GO HOME.

&gt;&gt; OH. WELL, THEY DIDN'T COME
HOME.

AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

&gt;&gt; THE OLDEST ONE ASKED ABOUT A
TRAIN TO WASHINGTON, D.C.

HE TOLD HER TO TAKE THE 11:45 TO
COLUMBUS AND CHANGE THERE, BUT

THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
FOR A TICKET.

THERE ARE AN AWFUL LOT OF
RUNAWAYS OUT THERE, MRS. FEAGAN,

AND I CAN'T PROMISE THAT--
&gt;&gt; MY CHILDREN AREN'T RUNAWAYS.

THEY WENT TO HELP THEIR FATHER.

WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, JUST
THROW YOUR HANDS UP AND SAY

NOTHING CAN WE DONE?

&gt;&gt; WE WILL DO OUR VERY BEST.

AND WE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN
SOMETHING COMES UP.

NOW EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

&gt;&gt; MAGGIE, HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU
HAVE WITH YOU?

&gt;&gt; I HAVE SOME.

&gt;&gt; I'M GONNA NEED IT.

I'M GOING TO COLUMBUS AFTER
THEM.

&gt;&gt; BUT YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF
THAT'S WHERE THEY WENT.

&gt;&gt; YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID.

SHE ASKED ABOUT GOING TO
WASHINGTON.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO,
BUT I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

WOULD YOU PLEASE STAY HERE IN
CASE THEY CALL?

&gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD LEAVE THIS TO THE

POLICE, ANNIE.

&gt;&gt; THE POLICE DIDN'T DO VERY
WELL BY ANGUS, DID THEY?

I'LL FIND THEM MYSELF.

&gt;&gt; IT WAS VERY NICE MEETING YOU
ALL.

I HOPE THE PRESIDENT HELPS YOUR
FATHER.

&gt;&gt; I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD VISIT
WITH YOUR FATHER.

&gt;&gt; ( woman ): THAT'S HIM!

COME ALONG, LEE.

&gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HIM?

&gt;&gt; BACK TO THE ORPHANAGE
HE RAN AWAY FROM.

WHERE ARE YO UR PARENTS?

&gt;&gt; ON THE TRAIN.

&gt;&gt; DON'T TRUST ANYBODY, SEE?

KEEP ONE EYE ON WHERE YOU'RE
GOING AND THE OTHER ONE ON WHERE

YOU BEEN.

&gt;&gt; ( conductor ):
HEY, YOU KIDS!

&gt;&gt; LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

&gt;&gt; STOP THOSE KIDS!

I WANT THOSE KIDS!

THEY DIDN'T HAVE TICKETS!

&gt;&gt; WATCH IT!

&gt;&gt; SORRY. SORRY.

MY FAULT. SORRY, SIR.

STOP THEM! STOP THEM!

&gt;&gt; HURRY!

&gt;&gt; I SAW THEM RUN THIS WAY.

THEY GOTTA BE AROUND HERE
SOMEWHERE.

&gt;&gt; ARE THEY GONNA CATCH US?

&gt;&gt; NO.

&gt;&gt; I WANT TO GO HOME.

&gt;&gt; I WISH YOU WE RE HOME.

&gt;&gt; HUH. ONE THING I'LL TELL YA,
IF THEY'RE ON THE FREIGHT, THE

BULL WILL TAKE CARE OF 'EM.

HE'S THE MEANEST BULL IN THE
YARDS.

LET'S CHECK THE PASSENGER CAR.

&gt;&gt; ( panting )
&gt;&gt; COME ON.

&gt;&gt; COME ON.

THERE WE GO.

&gt;&gt; ( bat hitting wall )
&gt;&gt; QUIET. MAYBE HE WON'T

LOOK IN.

&gt;&gt; ( man ): OH,
HE'LL BE LOOKIN' IN HERE,

HE WILL.

YOU CAN COUNT ON IT.

HE LIKES CHILDREN,
OLD BULL DOES.

HE EATS 'EM FOR BREAKFAST.

&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANNA BE BREAKFAST.

&gt;&gt; HEH.

AND WHEN HE GETS DONE, HE PICKS
HIS TEETH WITH A STEEL SPIKE.

&gt;&gt; HA HA...

&gt;&gt; TOP OF THE MORNIN' TO YOU,
MORON.

&gt;&gt; HA HA.

&gt;&gt; TELL ME, WERE YOU BORN
WITH THAT FACE, OR DID YOU JUST

GET THAT UGLY GROWIN' UP?

&gt;&gt; ( train whistle blows )

&gt;&gt; WHOA!

&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING TO YOUR LIKING,
SIR?

&gt;&gt; OH, EXCUSE ME, SIR.

HOW MUCH LONGER UNTIL WE GET TO
COLUMBUS?

&gt;&gt; THERE'S BEEN A SLIGHT DELAY,
MA'AM, BUT WE SHOULD ARRIVE

WITHIN THE HOUR.

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

&gt;&gt; ( bum ): HELLO!

HERE I AM AGAIN.

HA HA HA!

&gt;&gt; ( Jack ): HOLY COW!

&gt;&gt; OH, MY, MY.

WHERE ON EARTH ARE YOU KIDS
HEADED?

&gt;&gt; WE'RE GONNA SEE
OLD WINDBAG HOOVER.

&gt;&gt; HA HA HA HA!

YOU GOT THAT RIGHT!

&gt;&gt; WE'RE GONNA GO SEE THE
PRESIDENT SO HE CAN HELP OUR

FATHER GET OUT OF JAIL AND BE
HOME BY CHRISTMAS.

&gt;&gt; LILLY!

&gt;&gt; HE DO SOMETHING SERIOUS?

&gt;&gt; HE WAS ARRESTED FOR HITTING
A MAN ON THE HEAD WITH A

CROWBAR IN KANSAS CITY.

&gt;&gt; ( sighs )
THAT'S SERIOUS.

&gt;&gt; BUT HE DIDN'T DO IT.

&gt;&gt; WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

&gt;&gt; BOXCAR LOUIE.

&gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF A NAME IS THAT?

&gt;&gt; AMERICAN.

&gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU ON A FREIGHT
TRAIN?

&gt;&gt; I MIGHT ASK YOU THE SAME
QUESTION.

&gt;&gt; I ASKED YOU FIRST.

&gt;&gt; INDEED. HA HA!

WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

I'M A MAN OF THE WORLD,

A WORLD TRAVELER.

HA HA! YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT
TO LOOK AT ME NOW, BUT ONCE UPON

A TIME, CHILDREN, THESE HANDS
HELD THE DESTINY OF MANKIND.

I WAS ON WALL STREET...

THE VERY PLAYPEN OF THE RICH.

AND I A MAKER OF FORTUNES,
HELD THE DESTINY OF MANKIND.

I WAS ON WALL STREET...

THE VERY PLAYPEN OF THE RICH.

AND I A MAKER OF FORTUNES,
A REGULAR WHEELER-DEALER,

A BIG-TIME CHARLIE, IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

THEN CAME THE CRASH.

WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF WORK,
YOU'RE OUT OF WORK.

AND IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY
DIFFERENCE WHAT KIND OF WORK IT

WAS.

&gt;&gt; OUR FATHER'S OUT OF WORK.

&gt;&gt; WHERE IS THIS TRAIN GOING?

&gt;&gt; WE'RE HEADED TO PARKERSBURG,
WEST VIRGINIA, YES WE ARE.

BUT WE'LL BE JUMPING OFF A
LITTLE BIT BEFORE THAT,

YES WE WILL.

THE BULLS IN PARKERSBURG...

OHHH...THERE'S A BUNCH YOU
WOULDN'T WANT TO INVITE TO

SUNDAY DINNER.

&gt;&gt; ( whistle blows )

&gt;&gt; I WON'T DO IT.

I'LL GET DIRTY AND I'LL HURT
MYSELF.

&gt;&gt; A LITTLE DIRT NEVER HURT
ANYBODY.

&gt;&gt; I'M JUMPING, AND SO IS MAGIC
DOG.

&gt;&gt; YOU ARE NOT.

WE'RE NOT GOING.

&gt;&gt; THE BULLS IN PARKERSBURG ARE
BRUTAL.

&gt;&gt; ( sighs )
HOW DO I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOU?

&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T.

&gt;&gt; HOW DO WE GET OUT OF HERE?

&gt;&gt; BY BENDING YOUR KNEES AND
ROLLING WHEN YOU HIT, LIKE THIS.

&gt;&gt; I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT,
BERNICE.

I'M DON'T WANT TO.

&gt;&gt; HERE I COME.

&gt;&gt; JACK!

&gt;&gt; COME ON.

&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO NOW, LILLY.

YOU HAVE TO.

JUMP, LILLY, JUMP!

&gt;&gt; YOU GOT THE MAKINGS OF A
FIRST-RATE HOBO, BOY!

&gt;&gt; SO DO YOU.

WILL YOU TEACH ME HOW?

&gt;&gt; HA HA HA!

WHAT I CAN, WHAT I CAN.

ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

&gt;&gt; NO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

&gt;&gt; I'M OKAY.

&gt;&gt; THEN THERE'S NO TIME TO LOSE.

&gt;&gt; WHERE ARE WE GOING?

&gt;&gt; HOOVERVILLE.

&gt;&gt; HOOVERVILLE.

WHY IS CALLED HOOVERVILLE?

&gt;&gt; IN HONOR OF OUR DISTINGUISHED
PRESIDENT.

WHAT BETTER NAME FOR A CARDBOARD
AND TIN SHACK?

&gt;&gt; ( animal howls )
&gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THAT?

&gt;&gt; A DOG.

&gt;&gt; ( owl hoots )
&gt;&gt; NO, THAT. I DON'T LIKE IT.

&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST AN OWL.

&gt;&gt; ARE THEY POISON?

&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW, I NEVER ATE
ONE.

&gt;&gt; HA HA!

&gt;&gt; LOOK, YOU KIDS, YOU WANT TO
LOOK YOUR BEST WHEN YOU MEET THE

PRESIDENT.

I'M GONNA SIT OUT HERE AND KEEP
YOU SAFE.

WHY DON'T YOU GO ON IN THERE AND
GET SOME SLEEP?

GO ON.

TOMORROW MORNING I'LL SHOW YOU A
GOOD SPOT TO START HITCHHIKING

AND I'LL BET YOU GET TO
WASHINGTON BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

GOOD NIGHT.

&gt;&gt; ( train whistle in distance )
&gt;&gt; ...DISEMBARKING FOR

COLUMBUS, OHIO.

NOW BOARDING FOR SPRINGFIELD,
DAYTON, CINCINNATI, LOUISVILLE,

KENTUCKY, ON TRACK NINE...

&gt;&gt; MRS. FEAGAN?

&gt;&gt; YES.

&gt;&gt; I'M DETECTIVE BATES.

&gt;&gt; DID YOU FIND THEM?

&gt;&gt; WE DON'T THINK THEY'RE HERE
ANYMORE.

&gt;&gt; THEY WERE ON MY TRAIN WITHOUT
TICKETS.

I CHASED THEM, BUT THEY GOT AWAY
FROM ME IN THE YARDS.

THERE WAS A FREIGHT FOR
PARKERSBURG THAT PULLED OUT JUST

AFTER THAT.

&gt;&gt; ARE YOU TELLING ME MY
CHILDREN ARE ON A FREIGHT TRAIN?

&gt;&gt; THE POLICE IN PARKERSBURG
WILL BE LOOKING FOR THEM, MA'AM.

BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT SURE
WHERE THEY ARE.

&gt;&gt; THEN I'LL HAVE TO GO TO
PARKERSBURG MYSELF...

WON'T I?

EXCUSE ME.

&gt;&gt; ...PARKERSBURG, WEST
VIRGINIA, AND THE NATION'S

CAPITAL...

&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW THIS IS DONE.

THAT'S EAST...

THAT'S WEST.

YOU WANT EAST.

AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY
SEE YOUR THUMB.

&gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO GO ON THE
FREIGHT TRAIN.

&gt;&gt; NO, NO, THIS IS TOO
DANGEROUS.

THE BULLS ARE NASTY, AND NOT
EVERYBODY YOU MEET'S GONNA BE

LIKE ME.

THERE'S DANGEROUS PEOPLE
OUT THERE.

THIS WAY, YOU CAN SEE THE
DRIVER, SIZE UP THE SITUATION.

YOU LISTEN TO YOUR GUT.

SOMETHING TELLS YOU DON'T GET

IN, DON'T GET IN.

YOU LISTEN TO WHAT YOUR SISTER
TELLS YOU.

THINK OF LOUIE SOMETIME,
HE'LL BE THINKIN' OF YOU.

&gt;&gt; BOXCAR LOUIE!

&gt;&gt; GOOD-BYE, BOXCAR.

&gt;&gt; YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, JACK.

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

&gt;&gt; THERE'S A CAR COMING.

&gt;&gt; OH, NUTS.

&gt;&gt; HEY, LOOK!

&gt;&gt; I'LL DO THE TALKING,
AND DON'T GET IN UNLESS I SAY

IT'S OKAY.

&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

&gt;&gt; ( man ): WHERE TO?

&gt;&gt; ( bell rings )
&gt;&gt; LUNCH IS NOW BEING SERVED

IN THE DINING CAR, THREE CARS
BACK TO THE DINING CAR.

TODAY'S SPECIAL HOT ROAST BEEF
SANDWICH WITH FRIED POTATOES,

COFFEE AND APPLE PIE.

&gt;&gt; WOULD YOU CARE FOR HALF A
SANDWICH?

&gt;&gt; NO, THANK YOU.

&gt;&gt; PLEASE TAKE IT.

I'M MEETING MY CHILDREN AT
PARKERSBURG AND WE'LL HAVE

PLENTY TO EAT.

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

&gt;&gt; LOOK, LADY, I TOLD THE COPS,
I'LL TELL YOU.

WHEN THAT FREIGHT TRAIN PULLED
IN HERE, NOBODY WAS ON IT.

&gt;&gt; BUT THEY HAD TO BE ON IT.

&gt;&gt; NOT WHEN IT ARRIVED, NOT WHEN
IT LEFT.

WE GOT A THING ABOUT THAT IN

PARKERSBURG.

YOU OKAY, LADY?

YOU WANT SOMETHING?

&gt;&gt; I JUST HAVE TO THINK THIS
THROUGH.

&gt;&gt; YOU JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

RIGHT HERE.

&gt;&gt; SINCE I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY
ARE, I'LL HAVE TO GO WHERE

THEY'RE HEADED.

I HAVE TO FIND MY KIDS, MISTER.

WHEN IS THE NEXT TRAIN TO
WASHINGTON?

&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT TILL TOMORROW,
MA'AM.

BUT I GOT A COUSIN WHO'S DRIVING
THAT WAY TODAY,

IF THAT'D BE A HELP.

&gt;&gt; YES. YES, IT WOULD.

&gt;&gt; IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU TO TAKE
ME ALL THIS WAY, MR. NEEDLES.

&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU NEED A RIDE, AND I
WAS HEADING IN THE RIGHT

DIRECTION.

ANYWAY, I KIND OF GOT A SOFT
SPOT FOR KIDS.

&gt;&gt; BERNICE IS 12, LILLY'S 9, AND
JACK IS 6.

I HAVE A PICTURE.

THEY'RE VERY WELL BEHAVED,
AND THEY ALL GET GOOD GRADES IN

SCHOOL.

ANGUS AND I MAKE SURE THEY DO
EVERY BIT OF THEIR HOMEWORK.

&gt;&gt; THAT'S A GOOD-LOOKING BUNCH.

WHO'S THIS?

&gt;&gt; THAT'S LILLY.

SHE HAS AN EXCELLENT SINGING
VOICE.

AND JACK, HE'S A REAL DAREDEVIL.

HE'S FEARLESS..AND FUNNY.

&gt;&gt; IS THIS THE OLDEST?

&gt;&gt; YES, THAT'S BERNICE.

SHE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL.

I WISH I TOLD HER.

I HOPE SHE KNOWS.

BUT I'VE HAD TO SPEND SO MUCH
TIME WITH LILLY AND JACK, AND

BERNICE IS GETTING SO GROWN UP.

WHEREVER THEY ARE, I'M SURE
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.

&gt;&gt; WELL, THIS IS WHERE WE PART
COMPANY.

YOU KIDS TAKE CARE, AND I HOPE
YOU GET TO SEE HOOVER.

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR THE RIDE.

&gt;&gt; BYE, NOW.

&gt;&gt; MERRY CHRISTMAS.

&gt;&gt; I HOPE ANOTHER CAR COMES
ALONG.

&gt;&gt; LOOK, A PUPPET SHOW.

&gt;&gt; COME BACK HERE, JACK!

&gt;&gt; I'LL GET HIM.

&gt;&gt; JACK!

JACK, COME BACK HERE!

&gt;&gt; ( horse neighs )

&gt;&gt; COME ON, JACK, WE HAVE TO GO.

&gt;&gt; HELLO IN THERE!

&gt;&gt; COME ON, JACK.

&gt;&gt; I WANT TO SEE INSIDE.

&gt;&gt; ( puppet ): DON'T GO!

PLEASE STAY!

I FEEL SO LONELY!

&gt;&gt; WHO ARE YOU?

&gt;&gt; MADAME MAGNIFICO!

WHO, UH...

WHO ARE YOU WITH?

&gt;&gt; WE'RE ALL BY OURSELVES.

OUCH!

&gt;&gt; DON'T TELL PEOPLE WE'RE
ALONE.

&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT PEOPLE.

THAT'S A PUPPET.

&gt;&gt; ( sighs )
&gt;&gt; THIS IS LILLY AND BERNICE.

&gt;&gt; YOU'RE JUST IN TIME FOR THE
SHOW.

&gt;&gt; WE CAN'T STAY FOR A SHOW.

&gt;&gt; FIVE CENTS EACH, AND I'LL
THROW IN A FREE FORTUNE TELLING.

&gt;&gt; I'M AFRAID THAT'S TOO MUCH
MONEY.

&gt;&gt; HOW ABOUT A PENNY, THEN?

&gt;&gt; YOU'RE VERY KIND, BUT WE
REALLY SHOULD BE ON OUR WAY.

&gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO WASHINGTON TO
SEE PRESIDENT HOOVER.

WE'RE GONNA GET OUR FATHER OUT
OF JAIL.

&gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO SEE HOOVER?

WELL, YOU'RE GOI NG TO SEE
HOOVER!

AND THAT IS A PREDICTION!

HA HA HA HA!

&gt;&gt; â™ª ( Star Spangled Banner
&gt;&gt; A CHICKEN IN EVERY POT

AND TWO CARS IN EVERY GARAGE!

THAT'S MY MOTTO.

I'M BUSY RUNNING THE COUNTRY AT
THE MOMENT, SO I'VE ONLY GOT A

MINUTE, BUT I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE

SHOW.

BUT FIRST, PUT YOUR PENNIES HERE
ON THE STAGE.

HA HA HA!

A PENNY SAVED IS A PENNY EARNED.

&gt;&gt; WE CAN'T STAY LONG.

&gt;&gt; IT'S A SHORT SHOW.

&gt;&gt; OH!

( imitates chicken squawking )
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT A CHICKEN IN

EVERY POT?

&gt;&gt; HA HA HA!

&gt;&gt; WHERE DO YOU COME FROM?

&gt;&gt; FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

&gt;&gt; WHY DID YOU CROSS THE STREET,
MR. CHICKEN?

&gt;&gt; TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE,
MR. PRESIDENT.

&gt;&gt; HA HA HA HA!

&gt;&gt; WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE LOOKING FOR A
ROWBOAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

OCEAN, LOOKIN' FOR 'EM LIKE
THIS.

&gt;&gt; YOU'LL FIND 'EM.

&gt;&gt; AT LEAST I KNOW WHERE THEY'RE
GOING.

SO MANY CHILDREN ARE RUNNING

AWAY FROM HOME THESE DAYS AND
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE.

IT REALLY BREAKS YOUR HEART.

&gt;&gt; YOU WANT A STICK?

&gt;&gt; OH, NO, THANK YOU.

&gt;&gt; WHAT THE--?

OH, THAT LOOKS BAD.

&gt;&gt; THAT LOOKS LIKE LILLY!

OH, PLEASE, GOD, IT CAN'T BE
THEM!

NO, IT CAN'T BE, IT CAN'T!

WE SKIDDED, MUST HAVE HIT SOME
ICE.

&gt;&gt; I'M JUST GLAD WE CAME ALONG.

THERE YOU GO, DARLING.

YOU'LL BE GOOD AS NEW IN THE
MORNING.

SHE LOOKS ALL RIGHT.

&gt;&gt; YOU'VE BEEN SO FINE WITH HER.

GOT ANY OF YOUR OWN?

&gt;&gt; YES.

&gt;&gt; BYE, MR. HANDY!

&gt;&gt; CALL ME ANDY!

AND DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER
FROM PRESIDENT HOOVER.

BE BOLD!

&gt;&gt; WE WILL.

TIME FOR LUNCH, HORTENSE.

&gt;&gt; ( neighs )
&gt;&gt; HERE YOU GO, MR. NEEDLES.

&gt;&gt; OH, THANK YOU.

THE OTHER ONE'S FOR YOU.

&gt;&gt; OH, NO, I COULDN'T.

&gt;&gt; WELL, I COULDN'T EAT IT,
OTHERWISE.

LET'S POUR OUT A BIT OF THAT
COFFEE, WE'LL SHARE THAT, TOO.

&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

&gt;&gt; IF MY SON SAW THAT HORSE AND
WAGON, HE'D GO AFTER IT LIKE A

LOOSE NAIL TO A MAGNET.

HELLO!

&gt;&gt; ANDREW HANDY AND HIS MAGICAL
THEATER AT YOUR DISPOSAL!

&gt;&gt; MY NAME IS ANNIE FEAGAN,
AND I'M LOOKING FOR MY THREE

CHILDREN.

&gt;&gt; WOULD THAT BE BERNICE, LILLY
AND JACK?

&gt;&gt; OH! YOU SAW THEM!

THEY WERE ALL RIGHT?

&gt;&gt; THEY WERE A-NUMBER ONE!

ON THEIR WAY TO WASHINGTON TO
SEE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

STATES TO GET THEIR FATHER OUT
OF JAIL!

&gt;&gt; THE PRESIDENT!

WHEN DID YOU SEE THEM?

&gt;&gt; THEY WENT DOWN THE ROAD
ABOUT, OH, AN HOUR, MAYBE

45 MINUTES AGO.

&gt;&gt; OH, THANK YOU, MR. HANDY!

&gt;&gt; CALL ME ANDY!

&gt;&gt; BLESS YOU, ANDY!

MR. NEEDLES, THEY WERE HERE!

THEY WERE JUST UP THE ROAD
A BIT.

&gt;&gt; I'M COLD.

WHERE ARE WE NOW?

&gt;&gt; WE'RE RIGHT ABOUT...

HERE.

&gt;&gt; IT'S NOWHERE!

THERE ISN'T EVEN A NAME!

YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE.

WE'RE LOST.

&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT LOST.

&gt;&gt; WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO US IF
WE DON'T GET ANOTHER RIDE?

HOW WILL WE EVER GET HOME?

&gt;&gt; LOOK! THERE'S A CAR!

&gt;&gt; ( slurred ): HEY, HOP IN,
KIDS, THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM.

&gt;&gt; LILLY!

&gt;&gt; IT'S NICE AND WARM.

&gt;&gt; AAAH!

LET ME GO!

JACK, HELP ME!

&gt;&gt; OWWW!

COME ON, LILLY!

&gt;&gt; WAY TO GO, JACK!

&gt;&gt; I'LL KILL YOU KIDS
IF I CATCH YOU!

&gt;&gt; ( Jack ): IT WASN'T ME.

MAGIC DOG BIT HIM.

&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

&gt;&gt; A BARN, MAYBE.

&gt;&gt; LET'S STAY HERE.

IT'S WARM.

&gt;&gt; GO CHECK.

&gt;&gt; COME ON.

GOOD. WE CAN SLEEP HERE.

WE'LL GET AN EARLY START
HITCHING IN THE MORNING.

&gt;&gt; WELL, MAYBE THEY'LL GET THE
GUY AND LET YOUR HUSBAND GO.

&gt;&gt; I'M COUNTING ON THAT,
MR. NEEDLES.

&gt;&gt; RAYMOND.

EVERYONE CALLS ME RAY.

&gt;&gt; I REFUSE TO BELIEVE YOU CAN
BE LOCKED UP FOR SOMETHING YOU

DIDN'T DO.

&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I'M STAYING AT MY
COUSIN'S TONIGHT...

IF YOU NEED A PLACE.

I COULD TAKE YOU ANOTHER
40 MILES IN THE MORNING.

YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR KIDS IN THE
DARK, AND WE'LL BE UNDERWAY AT

FIRST LIGHT.

&gt;&gt; SINCE I HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO
GO, I'LL ACCEPT YOUR OFFER.

THANK YOU.

I'LL TAKE THE CHANCE YOU'RE
A GENTLEMAN.

YOU ARE, AREN'T YOU?

&gt;&gt; YES, MA'AM.

&gt;&gt; GOOD.

&gt;&gt; ( crying )
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE ALL RIGHT NOW, LILLY.

&gt;&gt; NO, I'M NOT!

I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE!

( crying )
&gt;&gt; I MISS MOMMY.

&gt;&gt; WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

IT'S A LOT EASIER TO KEEP GOING
THAN IT IS TO GO BACK.

MOMMY WILL COME GET US IN
WASHINGTON.

I'M SURE PRESIDENT HOOVER WILL
LET US CALL HER.

I BET HE GIVES US SOME GOOD
THINGS TO EAT, TOO.

BIG PIECES OF CAKE, AND ICE
CREAM...

ALL WE WANT.

AND WHEN HE HEARS WHY WE'VE
COME, HE'LL JUST CALL THOSE

PEOPLE IN KANSAS CITY AND TELL
THEM TO LET OUR FATHER GO.

HE'LL BE BACK IN DETROIT FOR
CHRISTMAS.

IT'LL BE THE BEST CHRISTMAS
WE'VE EVER HAD.

THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WHEN
WE GET TO SEE THE PRESIDENT.

&gt;&gt; BYE!

&gt;&gt; IT WAS SO GOOD OF YOUR COUSIN
TO TAKE ME IN.

SHE HAS A LOVELY FAMILY.

&gt;&gt; SHE REALLY ENJOYED YOU.

SHE DOESN'T GET MUCH COMPANY.

MY COUSIN EDDIE'S HEADING OVER
TO FRONT ROYAL THIS MORNING,

THAT'S IN VIRGINIA, AND HE'D BE

&gt;&gt; WHAT?

&gt;&gt; HOOVER GOES TO WALL STREET
ON GOOD-WILL TOUR!

READ ALL ABOUT IT!

&gt;&gt; EXCUSE ME.

&gt;&gt; GET YOUR PAPER HERE.

&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT HOOVER'S LEAVING
THE WHITE HOUSE?

&gt;&gt; TOMORROW MORNING.

WON'T BE BACK TILL CHRISTMAS
EVE.

&gt;&gt; THAT'S TOO LATE!

&gt;&gt; YOU WANT A PAPER?

&gt;&gt; WHAT'S THE FASTEST WAY TO GET
TO WASHINGTON?

&gt;&gt; THE BUS.

&gt;&gt; HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?

&gt;&gt; A BUCK SOMETHING.

WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE?

YOU WANT THE NEWS, BUY A PAPER.

HOOVER GOES TO WALL STREET!

&gt;&gt; AT A DANCE.

MY COUSIN --
WELL, I HAVE THEM, TOO --

MADE ME GO.

WELL, ACTUALLY SHE DRAGGED ME.

SHE SAID I'D NEVER MEET A MAN
STAYING AT HOME, AND I MET

ANGUS.

I WAS NINETEEN.

HE WAS THE FIRST MAN I'D EVER
REALLY BEEN OUT WITH.

WE WERE BOTH SHY AROUND OTHER
PEOPLE BUT NOT WITH EACH OTHER.

HA HA HA!

NEITHER ONE OF US COULD DANCE
VERY WELL.

BUT WE SURE COULD TALK, RIGHT
FROM THE FIRST WORD.

IT WAS LIKE WE HAD KNOWN EACH
OTHER OUR WHOLE LIVES.

I'VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT
ANOTHER MAN SINCE THAT NIGHT.

HE'S LIKE THE OTHER HALF OF ME
THAT WAS MISSING.

HE SAYS THE SAME ABOUT ME.

I SHOULDN'T BE TALKING OF SUCH
THINGS...

BUT IF WE COULD LIVE TOGETHER

FOREVER, IT WOULDN'T BE LONG
ENOUGH.

&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO.

&gt;&gt; LILLY, I HAVE PUT UP WITH
JUST ABOUT AS MUCH OF YOUR

COMPLAINING AS I COULD TAKE.

STOP WHINING AND GET US ON THAT
BUS TO WASHINGTON.

NOW SING.

&gt;&gt; I CAN'T.

I'M TOO SHY.

&gt;&gt; WAS DADDY SHY WHEN HE CROSSED
THE COUNTRY LOOKING FOR WORK?

YOU'RE GOING TO SING FOR US,
LILLY.

IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE.

YOU CAN DO IT, LILLY.

YOU HAVE TO DO IT, LILLY.

SING.

&gt;&gt; â™ª O LIT--

â™ª O LITTLE-- ( coughs )

â™ª O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM
â™ª HOW STILL WE SEE THEE LIE

â™ª ABOVE THY DEEP
â™ª AND DREAMLESS SLEEP

â™ª THE SILENT STARS GO BY
â™ª YET IN THY DARK STREETS

SHINETH
â™ª THE EVERLASTING LIGHT

â™ª THE HOPES AND FEARS
â™ª OF AL THE YEARS

â™ª WERE MET IN THEE TONIGHT
â™ª FOR CHRIST IS BORN OF MARY

â™ª AND GATHERED ALL ABOVE
â™ª WHILE MORTALS SLEEP

â™ª THE ANGELS KEEP
â™ª THEIR WATCH OF WANDERING LOVE

&gt;&gt; MORNING, EDDIE.

HOPE WE DIDN'T KEEP YOU WAITING
TOO LONG.

&gt;&gt; OH, NO, I'M FINE.

&gt;&gt; THIS IS MRS. ANNIE FEAGAN.

&gt;&gt; HELLO.

&gt;&gt; YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER
NOW.

&gt;&gt; NO PROBLEM, RAY.

MATTER OF FACT, I WAS THINKING
I COULD TAKE HER THE WHOLE WAYS

TO WASHINGTON, IF THAT'S ALL

RIGHT.

I MEAN, I GOT NOTHIN' BETTER TO
DO, I DON'T GOT A JOB OR

NOTHIN'.

&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE YOU GO.

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU...

RAY.

I'M SO VERY GRATEFUL.

&gt;&gt; THE PLEASURE WAS ALL MINE,
ANNIE.

YOU BETTER GET GOIN'.

BYE, EDDIE.

&gt;&gt; MRS. FEAGAN.

&gt;&gt; YES, EDDIE?

&gt;&gt; I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'D LIKE
A STICK OF GUM FOR THE ROAD.

&gt;&gt; YES, I THINK I WOULD.

&gt;&gt; ( honks horn )

&gt;&gt; â™ª ...THE ANGELS DID SING
â™ª WAS TO CERTAIN POOR SHEPHERDS

â™ª IN FIELDS AS THEY LAY
&gt;&gt; ( Cop ): MOVE ALONG, FOLKS.

HEY, NOW, YOU KIDS.

KEEP IT MOVING.

COME ON, FOLKS.

MOVE ALONG, COME ON.

STOP THE SINGING AND GO HOME TO
YOUR MOTHER OR I'LL TAKE YOU IN.

&gt;&gt; TAKE US IN WHERE?

&gt;&gt; WE CAN BE ON THE SIDEWALK IF
WE WANT TO.

&gt;&gt; OKAY, THAT'S IT.

LET'S GO, COME ON!

MOVE IT, FOLKS, THE LOT OF YA!

OFF YOU GO!

I'M TAKING THE THREE OF YOU IN
TO THE STATION.

&gt;&gt; I'M ALLOWED TO SING!

IT'S NOT AGAINST THE LAW TO
SING!

PLEASE! WE'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN!

&gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T ARREST ME FOR
SINGING.

IT'S NOT AGAINST THE LAW TO
SING.

&gt;&gt; IT'S AGAINST THE LAW TO
PANHANDLE.

&gt;&gt; WHAT'S A PANHANDLE?

&gt;&gt; BEGGING FOR MONEY.

&gt;&gt; I WASN'T BEGGING.

&gt;&gt; WE NEED THE MONEY FOR OUR
FATHER SO HE CAN COME HOME FOR

CHRISTMAS.

&gt;&gt; IT'S TRUE.

I EVEN ASKED SANTA CLAUS.

&gt;&gt; I'LL NEVER SING ON THE
STREETS AGAIN.

&gt;&gt; PLEASE. WE CAN'T HAVE
CHRISTMAS WITHOUT OUR FATHER.

&gt;&gt; GO ON, THEN, GET OUT OF HERE.

BUT DON'T LET ME CATCH YOU AT IT
AGAIN.

WELL, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH
YOU?

&gt;&gt; ARE YOU REALLY LETTING US GO?

&gt;&gt; WELL, IT'S CHRISTMAS,
ISN'T IT?

GO ON BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU!

&gt;&gt; MERRY CHRISTMAS!

&gt;&gt; MERRY CHRISTMAS!

&gt;&gt; MERRY CHRISTMAS!

&gt;&gt; MISTER, THREE ONE-WAY TICKETS
TO WASHINGTON, D.C.

&gt;&gt; THAT'LL BE $3.75.

&gt;&gt; IT'S NUMBER 4, IT'S OUTSIDE.

AND LEAVES IN 30 SECONDS.

&gt;&gt; COME ON, LET'S HURRY!

&gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT!

&gt;&gt; ( Jack ): I GUESS ALL THESE
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE HOOVER, TOO.

&gt;&gt; HEY, HEY!

WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

&gt;&gt; TO SEE PRESIDENT HOOVER.

&gt;&gt; OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

GET OUT OF HERE.

&gt;&gt; NOT UNTIL WE SEE HIM.

&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE
HIM.

GO ON NOW BEFORE YOU GET IN
TROUBLE.

&gt;&gt; JUST CALL HIM, PLEASE.

TELL HIM IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

THAT WE SEE HIM RIGHT NOW.

&gt;&gt; YEAH? AND I'M AN ELF.

NOW, BEAT IT!

&gt;&gt; YOU BEAT IT!

&gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT A SMART MOUTH,
SON!

&gt;&gt; YOU LEAVE MY BROTHER ALONE!

&gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO TALK TO THE
PRESIDENT ABOUT GETTING OUR

FATHER OUT OF JAIL.

&gt;&gt; WE WANT OUR FATHER TO COME
HOME FOR CHRISTMAS.

&gt;&gt; LILLY. JACK. COME WITH ME.

&gt;&gt; ARE YOU REALLY TRYING TO GET
YOUR FATHER OUT OF JAIL?

&gt;&gt; WE ARE.

HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, AND I
KNOW THE PRESIDENT WOULD HELP

HIM IF HE KNEW.

&gt;&gt; WELL, WOULDN'T THAT BE
SOMETHING--MEETING WITH THE

PRESIDENT.

WISH I COULD DO THAT MYSELF.

&gt;&gt; YOU CAN COME WITH US.

&gt;&gt; OH, I DON'T THINK I COULD GET

PAST THE GATE, AND I'M A
LITTLE OLD FOR SNEAKIN'.

BUT YOU THREE LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
UP TO THE GAME.

&gt;&gt; WE REALLY NEED TO SEE HIM.

CAN YOU HELP US?

&gt;&gt; THAT'S A PRETTY TALL ORDER.

BUT THEN, I'M A TALL FELLA.

&gt;&gt; ( horn honks )

&gt;&gt; ( Hiram ): WHEN THAT TRUCK
GETS THROUGH, WE'LL START.

GET HER UP.

&gt;&gt; THERE YOU GO.

BE CAREFUL.

&gt;&gt; DON'T GO UNTIL WE TELL YA.

&gt;&gt; I WON'T.

THANK YOU.

&gt;&gt; SAY HELLO TO HOOVER FOR ME.

&gt;&gt; COME ON, BOYS!

WE WANT TO SEE THE PRESIDENT!

&gt;&gt; I'M A CITIZEN!

&gt;&gt; WE GOT OUR RIGHTS!

&gt;&gt; ( all shouting )

&gt;&gt; HIRAM, THEY'RE IN.

&gt;&gt; OKAY, BOYS!

&gt;&gt; GO ON, GET OUTTA HERE!

&gt;&gt; ( Bernice ):
SOMEONE'S COMING.

FOLLOW ME.

&gt;&gt; STAY HERE, I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

&gt;&gt; EXCUSE ME.

COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE THE
PRESIDENT IS?

&gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE!

&gt;&gt; I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

&gt;&gt; MY AUNT FANNY.

CORPORAL!

KID, COME HERE.

&gt;&gt; COME ON!

&gt;&gt; SOME KID JUST GOT IN HERE!

&gt;&gt; ( clatter )

&gt;&gt; WOW! THIS PLACE IS HUGE!

&gt;&gt; IT'S FANTASTIC!

&gt;&gt; SO, WHERE'S THE PRESIDENT,
BERNICE?

&gt;&gt; WE'LL FIND HIM.

&gt;&gt; BOY, THIS IS SURE A BIG
HOUSE.

&gt;&gt; I WONDER WHERE HE IS?

&gt;&gt; THE WORD ON WALL STREET IS
THAT IT'LL TAKE 50 YEARS FOR THE

MARKET TO RECOVER.

YOU'D THINK I WAS PERSONALLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT...

THE WAY THEY WRITE ABOUT ME.

&gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW HOW
YOU REALLY FEEL ABOUT ALL THIS,

THE PERSONAL SIDE OF IT.

&gt;&gt; WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IS TO
HAVE FAITH IN THE IDEA THAT

PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND THE
EFFORTS OF INDIVIDUALS WILL PUT

THIS COUNTRY BACK ON ITS FEET.

&gt;&gt; THEY MUST BE UP HERE.

SOME KID JUST SNEAKED INTO THE
BASEMENT!

SHE MAY HAVE COME UP HERE.

LET'S CHECK THE BALLROOM.

&gt;&gt; I HEARD SOMEBODY UP HERE.

&gt;&gt; NOTHING. COME ON.

&gt;&gt; NOTHING OVER HERE.

&gt;&gt; ( Bernice ): ALL CLEAR.

&gt;&gt; OH, BOY.

&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

THERE'S THREE OF THEM!

&gt;&gt; LET'S GET THOSE KIDS!

&gt;&gt; ( Annie ): JACK! BERNICE!

LILLY!

&gt;&gt; LADY, ARE YOU THEIR MOTHER?

&gt;&gt; YES.

&gt;&gt; THE CHILDREN THAT WANTED TO
SEE HOOVER?

TWO GIRLS AND A BOY?

&gt;&gt; HAVE YOU SEEN THEM?

DO YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE?

&gt;&gt; INDEED I DO, MADAM.

THEY'RE IN THERE.

TRYIN' TO SAVE THEIR FATHER.

&gt;&gt; ( Bernice ): WAIT HERE.

LILLY!

&gt;&gt; MR. PRESIDENT, I THINK YOU
HAVE TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO

APPEARANCES.

IT IS PERCEPTION THAT COUNTS
TODAY, AND IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO

THINK POSITIVE, YOU HAVE TO GIVE
THEM SOMETHING TO THINK

POSITIVE ABOUT.

&gt;&gt; BACK IN IOWA WHERE I WAS
BORN, THE GROUND WAS COVERED

WITH SNOW BY NOVEMBER,
SOMETIMES OCTOBER.

HERE, IT'S ALMOST CHRISTMAS, AND
THERE'S NOT A SIGN OF IT.

&gt;&gt; THAT'S LOCKED.

THERE.

&gt;&gt; COME ON, THIS WAY!

&gt;&gt; THEY GOTTA BE HERE SOMEWHERE.

&gt;&gt; WHERE'D THEY GO?

&gt;&gt; I'LL GO THIS WAY!

&gt;&gt; MR. PRESIDENT, THOSE REPORTS
SHOULD BE READY NOW.

&gt;&gt; ( Jack ): LOOK!

THERE HE IS!

WINDBAG HOOVER!

&gt;&gt; WHERE IS HE?

WHERE?

I NEED TO TALK TO PRESIDENT
HOOVER!

&gt;&gt; HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?!

&gt;&gt; PLEASE! I NEED TO TALK TO
HIM! PLEASE!

&gt;&gt; CORPORAL!

SEE THESE CHILDREN OUT OF HERE!

AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY GOT
IN HERE!

IF THEY COULD, ANYBODY COULD!

&gt;&gt; YES, SIR!

&gt;&gt; A MINUTE, THAT'S ALL I NEED!

&gt;&gt; NO FUNNY BUSINESS NOW!

I'M GOING TO MARCH YOU OUT OF
HERE, AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

SAY A WORD, YOU GOT THAT?

NOW LET'S GO--MARCH!

&gt;&gt; I ALREADY TOLD YOU--
THEY DIDN'T GET IN.

&gt;&gt; AND I'M TELLING YOU THEY DID.

THIS MAN HELPED THEM.

&gt;&gt; IT WAS ME.

I SNUCK 'EM OVER THE WALL
WHEN THAT DELIVERY TRUCK CAME

IN.

&gt;&gt; NOBODY GETS PAST HERE ON MY
WATCH.

NOW STAND BACK, BOTH OF YA.

NOW STAND BACK, BOTH OF YA.

&gt;&gt; I WON'T STAND BACK.

I WANT MY CHILDREN,
NOW GET OUT OF MY WAY

AND LET ME PAST!

BERNICE! LILLY! JACK!

BERNICE! LILLY! JACK!

&gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

&gt;&gt; YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME HOW YOU
SNUCK IN HERE.

&gt;&gt; NO, WE'RE NOT.

&gt;&gt; ALL WE WANT TO DO IS TALK TO
THE PRESIDENT.

&gt;&gt; THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

&gt;&gt; YOU KIDS ARE OUT OF HERE.

&gt;&gt; HANG ON TO HIM!

GO SEE HIM, BERNICE!

&gt;&gt; HEY!

THERE THEY ARE!

THAT'S THEM!

THAT'S MY CHILDREN!

THEY'RE ALL RIGHT!

&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, LET HER IN.

&gt;&gt; KID, WILL YA--
&gt;&gt; MOMMY?

&gt;&gt; HA HA HA!

OH!

&gt;&gt; MOMMY!

&gt;&gt; OH, MY DARLINGS!

&gt;&gt; I MISSED YOU â–ˆ SO MUCH!

&gt;&gt; OH, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!

YOU REALLY ARE!

OH, MY BABIES!

&gt;&gt; I'M NOT A BABY.

&gt;&gt; I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M LOOKING
AT YOU!

WHERE'S YOUR SISTER?

&gt;&gt; PRESIDENT HOOVER?

PRESIDENT HOOVER!

PRESIDENT HOOVER!

MY NAME IS BERNICE FEAGAN, AND I
HITCHHIKED HERE ALL THE WAY FROM

DETROIT WITH LILLY AND JACK, SO
THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS LISTEN

TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY, BECAUSE
MY TEACHER MISS KNIGHT SAID YOU

COULD DO WHATEVER YOU WANTED TO.

&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, MR. PRESIDENT.

&gt;&gt; I DID A REPORT ON YOU IN
SCHOOL AND LEARNED THAT YOU

HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN
EUROPE, AND MY FATHER NEEDS

HELP IN KANSAS CITY!

&gt;&gt; JUST A MINUTE.

YOU HITCHHIKED FROM DETROIT?

DO YOUR PARENTS KNOW WHERE YOU
ARE?

&gt;&gt; MY MOTHER'S AT HOME.

I KNOW SHE MUST BE WORRIED,
BUT I HAD TO COME.

I WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU UNLESS IT
WAS EXTREMEL Y IMPORTANT.

MY FATHER'S IN JAIL.

BUT HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

AND I NEED YOU GO GET HIM HOME
FOR CHRISTMAS.

&gt;&gt; BERNICE!

&gt;&gt; MOMMY!

MOMMY?

&gt;&gt; OH, BERNICE!

OH!

I CHASED AFTER YOU THE WHOLE
WAY.

&gt;&gt; OH, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!

&gt;&gt; IF ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED TO
YOU, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD

HAVE DONE.

&gt;&gt; ( Hoover clears throat )
&gt;&gt; OH. MY.

PRESIDENT HOOVER.

I'M SO SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

&gt;&gt; NOTHING NEED BE SAID,
MRS. FEAGAN.

LET ME WELCOME YOU TO
THE WHITE HOUSE.

AND YOU TOO, BERNICE.

NOW, WHY DON'T YOU ALL SIT DOWN
SO YOU CAN TELL ME THE WHOLE

STORY.

AND YOU MUST BE LILLY AND JACK.

WHY DON'T YOU COME ALONG AND SIT
BESIDE YOUR MOTHER.

&gt;&gt; ( crying )I'M SO SORRY.

IT'S JUST SEEING THEM AGAIN.

&gt;&gt; THAT'S QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE.

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

&gt;&gt; IF THIS COUNTRY PULLED
TOGETHER THE WAY YOUR CHILDREN

OBVIOUSLY HAVE, WE'D ALL BE A
LOT BETTER OFF.

I THINK THE BEGINNING WOULD BE
A GOOD PLACE TO START.

&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.

&gt;&gt; ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE
BEEN MADE.

A CAR WILL MEET YOU AT THE
STATION IN DETROIT AND TAKE YOU

HOME.

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU FOR LETTING US
SLEEP OVER, MR. PRESIDENT.

&gt;&gt; MY PLEASURE, JACK.

&gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH YOU WON'T GIVE
SOMEONE THE SKINNY PORK CHOP,

YOU'RE STILL MY BEST FRIEND.

&gt;&gt; WHAT? HA HA!

WHY, THANK YOU, JACK.

I'M VERY LUCKY TO HAVE A FRIEND
LIKE YOU.

AND LIKE ALL OF YOU.

I PROMISE TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR
YOUR FATHER.

MEANWHILE, YOU MIND YOUR MOTHER

AND DON'T BE TAKING ANY MORE
TRIPS LIKE THIS ONE.

&gt;&gt; YES, SIR.

&gt;&gt; OH!

&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

&gt;&gt; LET'S GO, KIDS.

THANK YOU, SIR.

&gt;&gt; MY PLEASURE.

&gt;&gt; I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT WHAT IF
HE'S GUILTY?

&gt;&gt; WOW!

&gt;&gt; WHAT IS THIS?

&gt;&gt; OH, IT'S NICE!

&gt;&gt; DO YOU REALLY THINK PRESIDENT
HOOVER WILL GET DADDY OUT OF

JAIL?

&gt;&gt; HE SAID HE WOULD.

&gt;&gt; HE SAID HE'D TRY.

&gt;&gt; I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
JUST BARGED RIGHT IN ON HIM!

&gt;&gt; I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT,
AND I WAS THERE.

&gt;&gt; WONDERFUL.

WITH ANGUS COMING HOME,
THIS IS GONNA BE SOME CHRISTMAS.

&gt;&gt; THIS IS GONNA BE SOME TREE.

&gt;&gt; THE BEST WE'VE EVER HAD.

&gt;&gt; WE'LL WAIT AND LET DADDY PUT
THE STAR ON TOP.

&gt;&gt; AND HE'LL PUT THE PRESENTS

OUT.

&gt;&gt; AM I GETTING A DOG?

&gt;&gt; WE'RE GETTING OUR FATHER HOME
FOR CHRISTMAS.

&gt;&gt; I KNOW, BUT ARE WE GETTING
ANY REAL PRESENTS?

&gt;&gt; ( all laugh )
&gt;&gt; ( phone rings )

&gt;&gt; HELLO.

OH, MY GOD!

IS IT YOU, MY DEAR ANGUS?

&gt;&gt; IT'S ME, ANNIE.

IT'S ME!

&gt;&gt; ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

&gt;&gt; YES, I'M FINE.

I CAN'T TALK LONG.

ANNIE, THE MAN WHO GOT HIT,
HE'S GOING TO BE FINE, HE'S

GOING TO LIVE.

&gt;&gt; THAT'S WONDERFUL NEWS!

WHEN ARE THEY LETTING YOU OUT?

&gt;&gt; WELL, THEY SAY I--
I MAY ONLY GET A YEAR.

&gt;&gt; NO!

I WON'T LET THEM, ANGUS.

&gt;&gt; IT'S ONLY A YEAR, ANNIE.

&gt;&gt; NO!

&gt;&gt; IT'LL GO QUICKLY.

TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

&gt;&gt; ( guard ): TIME'S UP, FEAGAN!

&gt;&gt; I'VE GOTTA GO.

I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I CAN.

I LOVE YOU, ANNIE.

&gt;&gt; ( crying ) NO....

&gt;&gt; ( Jack ): WHEN'S HE COMING
HOME?

&gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW
HOW VERY PROUD HE IS OF YOU.

AND THAT HE'S FINE, AND HE
MISSES YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

&gt;&gt; WILL HE BE HOME FOR
CHRISTMAS?

&gt;&gt; WELL, THE THING IS--
&gt;&gt; IS HE GONNA BE HOME FOR

CHRISTMAS?

&gt;&gt; NO. HE ISN'T.

&gt;&gt; BUT HE HAS TO!

&gt;&gt; HE THINKS THEY'LL MAKE HIM
STAY A YEAR.

&gt;&gt; A YEAR?!

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT?

&gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T CALL, BERNICE.

&gt;&gt; HE HAD TO CALL!

HE SAID SO!

&gt;&gt; ( sobbing )

&gt;&gt; HE LIED!

HE SAID HE'D HELP, BUT HE LIED!

I THOUGHT HE COULD GET DADDY
HOME.

I WANT US TO BE A FAMILY AGAIN.

HE HAS TO BE HERE,
SO WE DON'T GET PUT OUT ON THE

STREET!

HE HAS TO BE HERE BECAUSE YOU
NEED HIM, BECAUSE YOU'RE

PREGNANT.

&gt;&gt; HOW DID YOU KNOW I
WAS PREGNANT?

YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW.

&gt;&gt; I'M NOT A CHILD.

WHY WON'T YOU SEE THAT?

&gt;&gt; NO, YOU'RE NOT.

YOU'RE NOT ANYMORE.

OH, MY DARLING DAUGHTER,
YOU'VE GOT THE WEIGHT OF THE

WORLD ON YOU.

I'M SORRY.

I'M SO SORRY.

WHAT YOU DID TOOK SUCH COURAGE.

YOU TRIED.

YOU DID THE BEST YOU COULD.

&gt;&gt; IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

&gt;&gt; IT WAS ENOUGH.

IT HAS TO BE WHEN YOU CAN'T DO
MORE.

I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

&gt;&gt; YOU ARE?

&gt;&gt; YES, I AM.

AND YOU SHOULD BE, TOO.

YOU'RE SUCH A VERY SPECIAL GIRL.

&gt;&gt; I WANTED SO MUCH TO HELP HIM.

&gt;&gt; SO DID I.

AND I COULDN'T, EITHER.

&gt;&gt; OH, WE'RE A PAIR, AREN'T WE?

THE TWO OF US CRYING LIKE THIS.

YOUR FATHER WOULDN'T LIKE IT.

YOU KNOW, HE'D WANT US TO BE
STRONG.

&gt;&gt; WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO HIM?

&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

BUT WHATEVER HAPPENS, WE'LL STAY
A FAMILY.

AND WHATEVER HAS TO BE DONE,
YOU AND I, WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.

ALL RIGHT?

&gt;&gt; ANNIE!

WE'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH.

&gt;&gt; I THINK I'LL WAIT FOR
BERNICE.

WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THE TWO
LITTLE ONES ON AND SAVE US A

COUPLE OF PLACES, ALL RIGHT?

&gt;&gt; OF COURSE, ANNIE.

&gt;&gt; OKAY.

&gt;&gt; THEY'VE LEFT.

WE'LL HAVE TO HURRY.

&gt;&gt; WHY SHOULD I GO TO CHURCH?

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

I PRAYED, MY FATHER'S STILL NOT
HERE.

I ASKED THE PRESIDENT TO HELP,
HE DIDN'T.

&gt;&gt; AND YOU DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANY REASON TO BELIEVE IN

ANYTHING?

BUT YOU'LL GO TO CHURCH TO MAKE
YOUR MOTHER HAPPY.

YOU FOUND YOUR FAITH WHEN YOU
NEEDED IT.

IT'S WHAT GOT YOU TO WASHINGTON.

YOU'LL FIND IT AGAIN.

HE SAID TO TELL YOU MERRY
