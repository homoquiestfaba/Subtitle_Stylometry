Can I be less than one?

lower than one.

There's zero.

[inhales sharply] Your parents
tell me you were born

with a unique condition.

I accidentally,
I accidentally kill people.

I'm sorry, I don't follow.

When people see me,
the... my face, they...



You accidentally assault
people with your face?

Let's pretend that what you're
projecting is, in fact, real,

why are your parents
still alive?

I think they must've
seen your face.

Well... my mom says

she knew something was wrong the day I was born.
[nurse] One more push.

[Jan yells]
[Paul] One more push, honey.

[nurse] You're so close.
[Paul] Yes.

It's a boy.
[baby cries]

He's the most beautiful
baby I've ever seen.

of the city when I was two</i>

<i>to some place more secluded.</i>

<i>The fewer the people,
the less accidents.</i>

<i>It was a fresh start,
my chance at a normal life.</i>

<i>That was wishful thinking.</i>

[scissors snipping]

<i>Because I couldn't
have felt any more... different.</i>

I understand your desire
to dwell in the past.

What really brought
you here today?

I just want to be normal.

Have you ever considered
that your wrappings

could simply be your mind's

physical manifestation
of depression?

[dramatic music]

[water rushing]


Oh, my God. [sighs]

I, I tried to tell him.

Damn it, Max.

[upbeat music]

[siren wailing]
Look, we know all these heart attacks

ain't his fault,
but it just doesn't sit right

that every time someone
croaks in this town,

we get a call and,
boom, there's your boy.

Yeah, it's strange. Just strange.
It is weird.

bad on the whole force

that we keep letting
him off with a warning.

Folks are dying,
and all we can say is,

"Well, you know, shit happens."

No, we, we completely understand.
We understand.


[playful music on radio]

So, uh...

Did, did, uh, Dr. Clingaman
say anything helpful?

No, Dad.

He died.

Yeah.

is a freezer, Dan.

The heater's still waiting
for Paul to fix it.

Uh, I don't mind a little
cold, Mrs. Richardson.

Yeah, well neither does Paul.

[phone ringing]
Oh, hello there, Alana Skovia.

What is that then, new country?

Alana Skovia is a type of babe,
and she's from the Ukraine.

Hmm, Paul, didn't you
have something to say?

Your dad has something
he wanted to say.

Max, your mother is worried
that you spend too much...

Wait a minute, excuse me, whoa.

Well.
We, okay.

We are worried you spend
too much time at home.

Yes, honey,
I think Dan would agree

that you're not going
to meet anyone your own age

locked away in your room.


signed up with one
of those dating services,

you know, like, like,
Dan on the, uh,

you know, on the cell phone?

Oh, there's an idea. Paul!

That's a great idea
because all the girls

are going to want
to swipe right on this, huh?

I look like a freaking
burn victim had sex

with a serial killer, guys.

Max, can you please
not use graphic

comparisons at the table?

That's a rule?
[Jan] Yes, it is.

Yes.
It's a rule now.

It is, it's a rule.

[fork clattering]

What's with the brick?

[quirky music]

[device beeping]
No.

Come on.

You said last time
was the last time.

That was a hammer, this is
a brick, it's different.

You need to see a therapist.
I did, he's dead.

This is your problem, man.

You lock yourself up
in here like a grandma,

sewing all this...

is that bunny sucking his own dick?
What?

That's a carrot,
he's eating a carrot.

Looks like a dick, man.

Jeez, you just don't get it.

You know how thirsty
the girls are right now?

Was there a drought?

[sighs] It's Valentine's Day, dude.
[Max] Oh.

It's the easiest day
of the year to score a date.

All the single ladies
are on a survival mission

to score a Facebook brag post,

and you get to be the guy
that makes it happen.

[scoffs]
Come on.

[phone chiming]

Hey.

[phone chiming]

Yeah.

Stop.

[phone chiming]

[phone beeping]

[phone clattering]

[punch thudding]
[TV playing]


<i>It's evil because
it's different.</i>

<i>It's strange!</i>

Oh.

The Foreign Exchange Program's
looking for host families.

That could be nice.

Get you a little foreign friend?

Mom, they're, they're
foreign exchange students.

They're not pets.

They're foreign,
and they want to come here.

Okay.
[Jan sighs]

Max, go get a magazine.


[TV chatter continues]

[video game noises]

Can I help you?

Uh, I was just... [stutters]

Oh, this isn't going
to fix your problem.

Okay.
Sorry.

[man on TV] <i>Stop, stop,
stop, stop!</i>

[Jan] What is that?
It's a magazine.

No, this is garbage,
take this, you take this.

Look, foreign exchange.

I haven't, I haven't seen anyone
play that game in a long time.

Oh, oh, I didn't catch
150 PokÃ©mon to abandon them.

150, that, that's a lot,
that's a lot of PokÃ©mon.

Um.
I, I fell.

You fell?

On a brick.
[groans]

I hate when that happens.

[man on TV yells]

Max Richardson.

[somber music]


[Jan sighs]

[Jan shivers] I can't,

it's too cold to fold.

[Jan sighs]
Just call someone.

Your father said he would
fix the heater two weeks ago.

No one should have
to live in these conditions.

[dial tone beeping]

[phone ringing]
That's not breakfast, that's sugar.

Hi, yes, I'm calling about
the heater in my living room.

It stopped working a week ago.

Oh, thank you, that's perfect.

It's 411 New Beginnings.

Oh, yes, he's my son.

Hello?
[phone hangs up]

Oh, my God, he hung up on me.

[doorbell ringing]

It's Dan.

Hey.

Hi, so, uh, I didn't break
your nose or anything?


I just have
a hyperactive immune system,

I'm practically deformed.

Okay, try not
to describe yourself

as being deformed tonight.

What's tonight?

Dan, I, I hate you.

You said you wanted
to meet girls,

I got you a Valentine's date.
No, no,

that's not what I said.

I said I, I can't,
I can't meet girls.

Well, now you can.
Oh, my God.

What, what's going on?

Oh, my God.

Dude, stop stressing.

Oh, my God.
It's going to be fine.

You're going to kill it.

Shit.
[Max sighs]

You know what I mean.

So, I'm, like, really feeling
your cologne right now.

it's compliments to this guy.

it's just Arm & Hammer.

Like the baking soda?

You know, I don't normally
set people up,

but, uh, I'm not going to lie,

I think you and Max
will be pretty bomb together.

Wait, what?

<i>Bonjour</i>, lady and gentlemens.

Happy Valentine's Day,
can I start any you off

with a cold beverage tonight?

You know what?

I got these two.

Dan.
[girl] Wait.

one of our milkshakes?


[waiter] Milk?
Calories.

All right,
two diet sodas, extra ice.

Thank you.

[soft music playing
in background]

[phone typing]

So... [chuckles] Erica...

that's a really strong name.

Um, is it, is it, uh, Filipino?

I'm Cuban.

Oh, I, I forgot,
I made you something.

I hope this isn't weird,

I, I don't really think
it's that weird.

You made me a napkin?

like a napkin, kind of, yeah.

But, uh, it's actually
a handkerchief, and if you,

if you cry,
you can use it to wipe,

or if you need to blow
your nose, um,

or all of the above, if, if
they're happening at the same,

same kind of time and...

Thanks.

Look, um... [chuckles]
I, I know you didn't,

you didn't have
to come here tonight.

But you, you seem really nice,
and this is kind of,

like, my first Valentine's
Day thing like this,

so...

thank you.

[man] I'm making a scene?
[woman] Yes.

You want me to make a scene?
[glass smashing]

You're an asshole, Craig! [sobs]

Erica.

What's hanging, sexy?



Hold up.

You're the kid that kills people
with his pretty face?

Uh, no, that's...

Oh, shit, you are.

Uh.

Come on, let me see.

Craig.
Two diets and, um,

my manager is
asking you to leave.

Your manager can suck my sack.
Totally.

[eerie music]

Uh.
[glass clattering]

What the hell, man?
Sorry, sorry.

It's fine, it's fine.
No, this ain't cool.

Okay, yeah, I'll get,
I'll get someone.

No.

You did this.

You clean it up.


Okay, but with, with what?

Start with whatever
this shit is.

[Max sighs]

Here, let me help you.
[hat thuds]

[people gasping]
Oh, my God. Craig, stop it!

[Max grunts]



to get this cleaned up for you.

[dramatic music]

[indistinct chattering]

[Max pants]

Uh...

do you, do you think
I could, I could...

I could take you on
a date some other time?

Uh...

I, I can't.

I, I'm sorry.

[dramatic music]

[vehicle whooshing]

[Max sobbing]



I'm Alex.

I remember, I'm just...

Just kind of
in the middle of something.

What, am I interrupting your
dramatic leap off the bridge?

[Max heavily breaths]

Bad things happen
because of me and...

And they'd stop once
I'm gone, okay?

That's pretty dark.

Yeah, well, my life
is pretty dark.

It could be the sunglasses.

Jelly bean?

But they only have
the gross flavors.

Well, because I ate
all the good ones,

and this is the shit
I was left with.

Thanks, I'm good.

[sweets splashing]
[Max gasps]

Fair enough, you jump, you jump

in the river
full of jelly beans.

I had, I had a dream
once that...

that I was swimming
in a pool full of jelly beans.

[mellow music]

Doesn't seem like
much of a drop.

You should probably find
a higher bridge.

What? [chuckles]

You want to die, right?

Yeah.

Well, then you should
find a higher bridge.

Wait, what? Wait, what?

Are you, are you serious?

Well, it's just physics.

What did you want me to say?


Look...

you're not going to jump.

You're going to die an old man
warm on your bed, not here.

Not this night.
[Max sobs]

"You jump, I jump," remember?

Did you just quote <i>Titanic?</i>

Well, my ride's here.

[brakes squeaking]
[Max] You're leaving?

If you're going to end
your life forever,

what's a couple
more hours with me?

[jolly music on radio]

Let me see if
she's taking visitors today.

Thank you, Myrtle,
nice to see you as always.

What's with all the caps
and exclamation marks?

Oh, it's just
a reminder of, like,

how I like to live my life.

Loud, vibrant, bold.

Oh, okay.

No, I'm, I'm here
more than the staff.

So, it's just annoying
that they keep making me

sign in so I'm annoying back.

[Alex sighs]
You know, when you

said you were going
to take me somewhere,

I, I didn't really think

you meant the retirement home.


nothing would make you
appreciate life

more than being
around a bunch of

old people who are
about to croak.

Hey.

Hello.

Alex, you usually
visit on Fridays.

Oh, it is Friday, Esther.

Oh, one of the upsides
to Alzheimer's,

it's almost always the weekend.

Hey, one of the many upsides.

[chuckles] Yeah.
By the way, I brought you

a present, this is Max.

Oh, what happened to your face?

I should have some vitamin D
ointment in my purse.

He doesn't need ointment.
[Esther] Oh, take the ointment.

Was it a burn?
Max fell on a brick.

[gasps] A brick?
And today he almost fell off of a bridge.

are you drunk?

No, he's depressed.

this boy thinks he's depressed.

Depressed?
[Esther] Yeah,

wait until your bladder stops.

And they put you on this pill
that they shove up your ass

and then it gives you rashes in
places you didn't even know you had.

Then we can talk
about being depressed.

Oh my, your face.

Oh, good,
you have ointment. Ha-ha!

I have written over 30 novels.

I think I have an understanding
of the process.

You wrote novels?

Write novels, I'm not dead yet.

Romance novels.

[with raspy voice] Dirty ones.

Oh, like Danielle Steel?
My mom loves her.

Yeah, well, I went to college

with that bitch,
and let me tell you,

that ginger whore doesn't have

one original thought
in her brain.

Her last name is Steel
for Christ's sake.

She stole my shit!

Tell them what
you're writing now.

I think it's fabulous.

novel. Not so much a memoir,

a personal walk
with Alzheimer's,

my descent into the disease.

I feel at my age,
all I have left is my mind.

If I lose that,
what else is there?

Son of a bitch, here she goes.

Not everyone has the ability
to face the unknown

with such courage, Esther.

I told you before, I think your
book's going to change lives.

I suppose, I mean, there
really isn't anything like it.

Except for maybe that one movie.

What movie?

Uh, you know, the one where
the woman can't remember,

and he comes every day.
<i>The Notebook?</i>

Yes, it's maybe
a lot like that one.

[Alex chuckles]

[somber music]

You didn't, you didn't have
to walk me all the way home.

Oh, I just wanted to make sure

you're home wasn't the bridge.

You're home, cool.

Yeah.
Have a good night.

Do you...


what are you doing tomorrow?

Tomorrow?

Yeah.

Oh.

I can't.

Okay.
I'm sorry.

No, that's...

Uh...

I just... it's not you.

Today was really fun.

Um, I just... I wasn't really...

planning this.
Yeah, okay.

Okay.

Sorry.

Have a good night.


[music playing on video game]

Did you at least
get her last name?


Dude, you always ask
for the last name

so you can creep her
on social media.

Ugh.
Was she hot?

Uh, I don't know.
[controllers clicking]

I'm not buying it.


No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[chuckles] Ha!

I'm over this.

You know, you could try
retracing your steps.

Try and bump into her again.

Oh, see, a little bit
of ass, I told you.

[gentle music]

[truck rumbling]

Uh, hey, you, you just,
you just missed your bus.

Are you stalking me?
[Max] What?

No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm...

So what, what are
you doing here?


Maybe I'm stalking you.

You didn't know I was
going to be here.

Really? Because I'm pretty sure

I'm here and so are you.

I think the fact that I can't
see your confused face

makes me want to screw
with you more.

Are you sure you don't
want to hang with me again?

Don't you have school?

I'm, I'm, I'm home-schooled.

That's still school,
it's literally in the name.

It's, it's, it's called an
independent, independent study.

Hey, if you're
already skipping...

why not just spend
a couple more hours with me?

[gentle music]

Yes. [sighs]
Yes?

before I start saying no.

[Max chuckles] Okay.

Can I interest you two
in a free RPG starter pack?

How many goblins
are in this game?

Hundreds, and there's like
goblin hordes and clans and...

But there's only one wench?

Eleanor the Savage Queen of Man.

What are those goblins
doing to Eleanor the Savage?

Well, they are, um,
ravaging her dungeon.

This is not enough. Excuse me?

Hi, do you have
any more in the back?

[Alex shrieks]

[jelly beans clattering]

[Max chuckles]

Jelly beans are supposed
to feel like jelly

not like gravel.

[both chuckle]

My dream would have been
much more comfortable.

What was your dream?

Um, a river full of Jell-O.

What flavor? [chuckles]
Celery.

That's, that's not a real thing.

Um, it is 100% a real thing,

housewives in the 1960s used it

to rebel against their husbands.

Alex, I have
to tell you something.

I was born with a face and...

Ooh, you were born with a face.


[gentle ambient music]

[exhales sharply] God.

My face is lethally attractive.

So, when people see it,
when they see my face, they...

Die?

[loudly sighs]

Okay.

Okay?
I mean, not okay, but...

it's old news.

You already knew?

Besides, you're kind of
a big hit at the hospital.

[Max chuckles]

Wait...

what are you doing
hanging around the hospital?

I have a rare
cardiovascular disease.

What's wrong with your heart?

to endorphins.

Excitement causes inflammation,

which causes my heart to grow.

This monitors heart
rate and heart size.

So any emotion,
good or bad, my body rejects.

It's okay though because they
put me on this trial medication,

and I got really lucky
because it works.

So, now my heart is basically
on <i>Weight Watchers</i>.

So, you're fine?

Well, if you consider
taking a pill every day

and wearing a robotic
bra fine, then, yes.

My heart is not currently
a ticking time bomb.

Have you ever thought about
if your life were a movie,

what song they would
use in the montage?

Mm... no.

Do, do most people
think about that kind of stuff?

Yes, everyone, except you.

[Max chuckles]

This is for one of those moments

where your life
derails you, and your head

and your heart can't keep up.

Everything plays out
like a blur.

And all you hear is this.

[gentle music playing on phone]

[gentle music]

This movie theater hasn't gotten
a new movie in five years,

but this will make it
feel like new.

[both exhale]

Is this wine?
Yes, the vodka kind.

It tastes like nail polish.
That's how you know it's effective.

How do you know what
nail polish tastes like?

Thanks. [sighs]

[jovial music playing]

finish this whole bottle.

Don't you dare ruin this for me.
I've wanted to do this for so long.

[whispers] Why?
Because I could never do

anything fun,
because I was always sick.

really have any friends.

[dramatic music playing]

You're my first friend.

[creepy child's laughter]

Do you want
to play a drinking game?

How, we've never seen this movie?
Yes, it's like

the Any Movie Drinking Game.

The Any Movie Drinking Game?
[whispers] Yes, go!

Okay, okay, okay, uh,
if you see a title card, drink.

Go.
Okay.

[upbeat techno music]

[Alex chuckles] Next.

Oh, okay.
Oh, if there's a flashback.

Yes!

Any time an actor talks.

Any time it says,
"From the producers of,"

Any time someone wakes up, go!

Eugh!
[planet booming]

Planets! Excessive
armpit hair. Cheers!

[Max chuckles]

[groans]
Gosh, it's really hot.

Are you hot?
No.

I'm, like, boiling
in here. [chuckles]

Why is it sticky here, too?
[Alex giggles]

Can you feel your teeth?
Yes.

Are they there?
Is this your first time drinking?

[Max groans]

Buddy, you need to drink this.
[groans]

What, all of it?
Yeah, all of it.


[Alex] You can.
I'm going to drown.

[Max gulps]

[Max chuckles]
Oh!

[phone buzzing]

Oops.


Hey!

Dude, why aren't we hanging out?

<i>This is stupid, come over.</i>
Hi.

Oh, shit, um, you two just
get back to whatever it is

that you were doing, and Max?

Yeah.

<i>You're my boy.</i>
Oh. [groans]

Who was that?

Dan.

Dan.

What was that?

Oh, this is the tiny
light of death,

pray it never blinks.

Max?
Hmm.

I want you to stitch me
like one of your French girls.

[gentle ambient music]

Okay, Rose.

[with puppet voice]
I can feel you staring at me.

if I'm staring at you.

I can't see what you're
doing. [chuckles]

[gentle music]

Hi.

[door clicking]



Max, I...

Oh, wow.

[softly mumbles]

A girl.
Oh, God. Please kill me.

Hi, I'm Alex.

Whoa, whoa.
[Alex] Oh.

Sorry, I'm a hugger.
What, since when?

No, you're not!
[mumbles]

I'm, uh... I, uh... I'm a shaker.

[Alex] Hi.
Hi.

Dad.

[Alex chuckles]


This is Yu Shen.

She's from the exchange program.

Yu Shen,
welcome to your new home.

I'm in hell.


You're so cute, isn't she cute?

Yes.
[cat meows]

Oh!
[cat hisses]

[door slamming]

She's a little jet-lagged.

[upbeat music playing]


You take two steps forward
and the next thing you know,

you're face down
in the shitter wondering

how the hell you got there.

Hey, why is Rosemary
sitting all by herself?

She's waiting for her son to take
her to get pie for her birthday.

She says he comes every year,
but I've never seen it.

It's her birthday?

82, but I didn't tell you.

She wants everybody
to think she's 88.

Why?
Well, when you're young, you lie about your age

because you can't accept the
fact that you're getting old.

But when you crack 70,
all you want is for people

to tell you,
"You don't look your age."

[Max chuckles]

The pie is not
going anywhere, Ro.

Get your sweet ass in here!

Could you stop screaming at me?

She's always on me about my ass.

Oh, I love this game.

Happy Birthday, Rose.

88 years, can you believe it?

88, you barely
look a day over 82.

You told him.

Let the boy give you
a compliment.

Thank you, I have
a lot to be thankful for.

My health, my friends.

I honestly don't know
what I'd do without you.

Well, you would carry on
like the rest of us.

I told you,
I'm not strong like you, Esther.

If I knew what was coming,

I don't know if could put
myself through it.


We didn't sign up just
for the good parts.

The good comes
with the bad, that's living.

Oh, shit,
I hate this goddamn game!



to American cuisine.

[phone clicking]
Craft.

Max, did your goblin
starter kit come

with an oraculum gem?

I have no idea what that means.

Yu Shen, what does
your mom make for dinner?

Maybe I could try
to something ethnic.

[doorbell ringing]

[steps loudly]

[door thudding]

Uh, you got to pay for these.
[Jan] Sorry about that.

Sorry, here you go.
This is for you.

Thank you so much, sorry again.

Have a good night.

Tomorrow, you're taking her.
What?

No, she, she, she doesn't
want to be here.

Max, Yu Shen's family
is very well off, okay?

This is an adjustment for her.
So what?

Can you please
show a little sympathy?

I'm... so, I...
you want me to feel

bad for her because she's rich?

hurt you at all to try

and help her get acclimated?

I have plans tomorrow!

Max, I'm asking you
to be a friend.

Mom, I'm supposed to go
camping with Alex and Dan.

Then you, Alex, Dan and Yu Shen

will have a great day tomorrow.

This is a dictatorship.

Well, no one said it
was a democracy.

Oh, real American, Jan.

Oh, you're calling me Jan now?
[Max] Yeah, you look

like a Jan to me.

Okay.

[door slamming]

Thanks, thanks, Paul.
Thanks for your help!

How am I missing Grishnakh.
And for listening!

Honey, could you move my character kit?
What?

Grishnakh. He's a level three key master.
What?

He, he's, he's,
he's the only goblin

who can penetrate
Eleanor's secret vault.

I'm lost without him.

It was right here
in this front drawer.

What is this game?

[bright music]



I hate to burst your bubble,
but it's way too flimsy.

Uh, don't act like
you know what I'm doing.

Well, it looks like
you're making a walking stick.

That's funny because
I'm making a...

[twig snapping]

...wand to close the portal.

What portal? [chuckles]

One to the alternate
dimension Dan's dates

keep crawling out of.
[camera clicking]

I don't know, maybe Tiffany's
exceptionally warm-blooded.

Like a human polar bear.
Please, have more respect

for the polar bears.

of us against this wall?

That's a tree.

Aren't you freezing?

No, it's fur.

Oh.
[Dan] It's nice.


[camera clicking]

you're bleeding.

I just... oh.


I've got, uh...
here, give me your hand.

No, that stings, I don't
really want you to do that.

Muffin tits.
What, muffin ti...

[Alex sighs]
[Max] Give me one second.

Oh, it looks like we have
a Boy Scout on our hands.

[mellow music]

How's that feel?

Fine, thank you.

[heart pounding]

[Tiffany giggles]

[Yu Shen snores]

I know he's your friend,
but that's got to get old.

I don't know, I...

I accepted a long time ago

that Dan has...

what I don't.

Oh, come on.

You're not exactly wearing
that 'cause you're ugly.

[Max snickers]

It would be nice to know what
you looked like under there.

It's just a face.

What are you doing?

Close your eyes
and don't open them

until I tell you to, okay?

Okay, Mr. Serious.


[gentle ambient music]

I wish you could see my face.

You really know how to make
a girl feel like Helen Keller.

[Max laughing]

[Alex laughing]

[Alex] Max?
Yeah.

Have you ever been kissed?

Almost...

once.

I was in the first grade
and I met this girl,

and we decided that we would
be each other's first kiss.

So, I told her
to close her eyes.

But first graders, they just
don't listen very well.

I'm not going to make
the same mistake as that girl.

Technically, it'd be hard
because you're blind.

[Alex sighs]

[heart pounding]

No, no! [chuckles]
[chuckles] Nice.

Every time. [groans]
Here. Have fun losing.

Wait, does she even
know how to play it?

[character grunting]
Oh, damn, she's good.

How are you so good at this?

Be my American boyfriend?

What?
[phone buzzing]

Hey, are you on your way?

Oh, um, my mom just declared
a mandatory spring cleaning,

so I'm kind of
a prisoner at the moment.

Spring? It's freezing outside.

I know, she doesn't understand the
seasons, so we must all suffer.

Oh, God, I didn't even know
you could do that!

[controller thudding]

Hold on one second.

Let's get nasty tonight.

What, what, what did she say?

[Alex chuckles]
[Max] I'm sorry, there's weirdness happening.

Just text if you want
to hang out later, okay?

Yeah, I'll talk
to you later, bye.

[Alex sighs]
[announcer] <i>Paging Dr. Ross,</i>

<i>please, report
to emergency immediately.</i>

[muffled talking]

Max, can you pause the game?
I need help real quick

with something small.
Sure, Mrs. Richardson.

Ah-ah. This request isn't

either going to be
small nor quick.

I need you to take out
the Christmas tree.

Told you.
[festive music]


You know what? Shut up.

You did this.

[Dan groans] Shit, hold on, hold on.
[Max] Okay.

a splinter. [groans]

let's go upstairs.

I think my mom's
got some tweezers.

[Dan] It hurts.
[Max] Just stop crying.

Don't... you're going
to burn the house down!

[Max] Whoa, Mom, Mom!
[Dan] Get some water, quick!

[Max yells]
[Dan groans and yells]

All right, all set.
So, you're going to change out

the dressing in two
to three days.

I'm prescribing you
an antibiotic ointment,

so you can put it on every day.

Do you have any questions?

What are you doing later?
You can take any

over-the-counter pain
medication. Just make sure

you're taking the proper dosage.
And if the pain or swelling

increases,
you come in immediately.

Otherwise,
I'll see you in seven days.

Wait, I get to see you again?

For your follow-up, yes.

Damn.

You know, she really
doesn't seem like your type.

Yeah, what do you know
about my type.

Hmm, brainless.

[bag thudding]
[groans]

This is good gauze,
she gave you the good stuff.

Yeah?
Yeah.

Twinsies.
[chuckles]

You didn't even get her number or anything, so.
Dude.

[Alex's mom] I don't understand,
why didn't you tell me?

Mom, because I knew
you'd freak out.


Hey.

Um...

Uh, Christmas tree attack.

That's funny, uh,

I'm Dan, this is Max.

They work with me at the home.

Then you must spend
an awful lot of time together.

different shifts. Don't worry.

It's okay. Okay, well, it was
good to see you, feel better.

[somber music]

Dude, what the hell?

Let's get out of here.

10,000 units of Gremlin.

And he supposedly comes
with detachable goblin armor.

Which you should be
able to hear.

[box clattering]

Hey, Dad, when you and Mom met,

how did you guys know
that you liked each other?

[box clattering]

I took your mother to dinner.

I think it was...
our second date.

We were walking
to the car and she said,

"Paul, you love me, okay?"

And, and that's how I knew.

You might think it's blatantly
obvious that you like Alex,

but there's a good chance
she has no idea.

Uh, I never said I liked Alex.

Well, hypothetically,
if you did.

Communication goes
a long way with women, Max,

especially since they think
men are incapable of doing it.

And I'm going to go out
on a limb and say

that if you did decide
to tell Alex how you feel...

you might like
what she has to say back.

[gentle music]

in the Blegh Sex Shop?

something really gross or really lame.



your dad's nudes.


Alex, are we going
to talk about yesterday?

Oh, um, I just said
you volunteered at the home

because it's easier for my mom.

Easier?
Yeah.

Check-ups are really
triggering for her

and the idea of me
having friends

still feels like
a death sentence.

But she likes when
I volunteer at the home

because she thinks it's nice

and safe and boring.

You're on meds though
so why is she so worried?

Because that's
how anxiety works.

Okay, I'm sorry.

It's fine.

Don't tell me it's Friday.

I know it's Wednesday.

It's Wednesday.
Yeah.

[jovial music playing]

What's all this?

Oh, uh, we got Rosemary pies.

Uh, but we weren't sure
what flavor she liked best,

so we just got her
a slice of each one.

What's wrong?


[machine beeping]

to see you.

Rose?

Rose?

I, I can't let her
see me like this.


[heart pounding]

Rosemary, it's me and Alex.

[Alex sniffles]

[Alex sighs]

You okay?

It's not right.

The way they have her
hooked up to those machines.

I know, it sucks.

But they are
what's keeping her alive.

No.

They're barely
holding onto her...

for what?

Some stupid moral compass

that says
that's the way it has to be?

That's the way it is.

Well, what we can do about it?

You can help her.

Alex, you can't ask me that.

You said it doesn't hurt.
I don't think it hurts.

It doesn't look like
it does, but I, I...

it's not like I can ask them
after it happens.

[somber music]

Alex.

I know you think what happens
with you is a curse.

But those people who have seen
your face will never have

to know what it feels like
to lose yourself slowly.

To have your last memory
be withering away

in a hospital bed.

She shouldn't have to bargain
away her dignity to die.

[somber piano music]

[machine beeping]

Hey, Rosemary.

Do you want to go to sleep?

[machine blaring]

[phone clicking]

[door squeaking]

[door thudding]

Yu Shen, hi!

How, how was school?

[bag thudding]

She's miserable, and your father
is taking over the house.

Max, will you please
explain to your mother

that some of us have a stressful
job to go to all week

and shouldn't be villainized

for treasuring a minuscule
amount of free time.

What does it look like
I'm doing right now, Paul?

This is a job.

[Jan loudly sighs]

So, how are things with Alex?

I don't know.
She's not texting me back.

Well, how you perceive things

may not be how Alex sees them.

Okay, well, how are guys

supposed to just psychically
know what girls are thinking?

It just, it makes,
it makes no sense.

If I knew the answer
to that my house

wouldn't be overrun by goblins.

I'm sorry I enjoy the few
things that make me happy.

So, now I'm the villain.
Max, will you please

explain to your father
the definition

of a double standard?

Oh, my God, this is so stupid.

You just need to stop
nagging him, and,

Dad, you need to stop
playing that game so much.

I mean, it's not that
complicated, holy shit!

[gentle ambient music]

[door slamming]

[crickets chirping]

Ah-ha! See? I knew
she had a shift today.

Just got to make sure
she's no longer with Craig.

Shit, here she comes.

in the background]

<i>Bonjour,</i> gentlemen.
Hi.

Have you heard
our specials today?

No, but you seem pretty special.

don't we go to the same school?

What? We should go
to the Spring Fling together.

[waitress] Yeah?
Yeah.

[chuckles] Pick me up at eight.
Okay.

Dude, what? You're coming.

Wait, so we're not even eating?
No, that's dumb. You're coming to the dance.

No, I, I don't even go
to your school, man.

Look, it doesn't matter, dude.
You're my wingman, bring Alex.

really talking to me, so.

What? Give me this.
Hey, Dan, give that back.

Come here. You can't just
take my phone and then...

[phone beeping]
Oh, hello.

[gentle ambient music]

[phone chiming]

What did she say?
Hold on.

What?
Just drop it.


Your medicine...

did you...

[Max sighs]

Is it not working?

They just need to up my dosage.

But your heart, your...

your heart's gotten bigger.

I just don't understand why
you didn't say anything to me.

Why, so you could freak out,
stop talking to me

and I go back to living
in a padded cell?

You didn't even give me
a chance and now,

now I feel like I'm the reason

this whole thing
has gotten so bad.

I'm sorry I've made it
so bad for you.

That's not what
I'm saying, Alex.

You just have to wrap
your face every day, Max.

I don't get a quick fix.

It's really not fair.

[gentle ambient music]

I'm sorry.

This is the dumbest
tissue box I've ever seen.

[both chuckle softly]

My mom likes
to hide little words

of encouragement
around the house.

It's sweet,
but her execution, it's...

well, it's shit.

[Max laughs]

Alex...

is there anything I can do?

my heart donor.

Or you could take me
to that dance.

I didn't, I didn't jump.
But you wanted to.

What would you have done

When I was four, they told me
my life expectancy was 16.

I'm 17 now, and I don't

I know I'll still never

I'll never have a family.

You're not a burden, Alex.

I've been thinking

How I should ask you.

Max, I'm not
getting any better...

I won't do that.
I couldn't do that.

my mom through it anymore.

you're asking me?

<i>The coroner said she died

<i>So, the judge dropped
all of the charges,</i>

<i>After the trial, the publicity</i>

<i>from the case made
national headlines.</i>

<i>Most people didn't believe
there could be a kid</i>

<i>with a lethally attractive face.</i>

<i>But there are others
who somehow knew,</i>

<i>or hoped that I could help them,</i>

<i>the same way Alex hoped</i>

<i>that I could help her.</i>

<i>I always thought that
my face only caused pain,</i>

<i>what I learned was, I could
use it to take pain away.</i>

<i>I still visit Esther.</i>

<i>She sometimes
asks where Alex is.</i>

<i>It's harder for her
to remember the big things.</i>

<i>I tell her that Alex
is busy suing Danielle Steel</i>

<i>for plagiarism,

<i>The last thing Alex taught me
