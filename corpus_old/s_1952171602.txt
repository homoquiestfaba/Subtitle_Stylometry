Hey!

 <i>Head er dit problem?!</i>

Vic's name is Amos Delaware.

Got it off his Native American
tribal ID.

Apparently, he was chief
of the Montiquan 

Indian Nation.

Montiquans were one of the first
tribes to settle in Manhattan.

A real live native New Yorker.

Not anymore.

The guy just bumped
into us and then...

I saw him pull the gun out.

 <i>Entonces estaba caminando...</i>

That's the sexiest thing
I've ever heard.

Okay, guy why don't you
explain to me why you thought

it was a good idea to pull out
a loaded gun on a crowded train.

Yeah, yeah, hang on.
Do me a favor.

Tell it to that, would you?

One minute the man

was sitting there,
the next he was dead.

Thanks.

Small caliber gunshot
wound to the abdomen.

Not much bigger than a .25.

Yep, minimal blood loss,
no exit wound.

Well, that's because the bullet

was definitely fired
from the outside.

Come on, now.

A shooter out there
to hit a guy in here

on a moving train?

Lebron James couldn't
hit that shot.

There's always that, uh,

last second
half-court shot

that somehow makes it in.

Question is:

Who fired it?

HAWK: Okay, so this is
the Number Seven line

approachg Woodside, Queens,
and according to the

Department of Transportation,
the track stretches

a little less than half
a mile between that station

and the previous stop,
which is 52nd and Lincoln.

And when you stack

what they're giving us
for rush hour train speed

against the witness
reports from the scene,

we can estimate
that the train

was traveling
approximately

32 miles an hour
at 9:26.

All right, then.

We know the vic was seated

in the last car
of a 10-car train.

Right, and based on
the position of his seat

and the bullet's impact
on the safety glass at 5'11"

from the floor,
 entered at roughly

a 70 degree angle.

HAWKES: Okay, so
assuming Mac's right

about a .25 caliber bullet,

we can plug in a
standard bullet speed

of 760 feet per second.

Trajectory angle of 70 degrees,

train velocity
32 miles per hr,

track distance 2,640 feet

and time...

9:26 A.M.

And then all we have to
do is run a simulation.

There, that's where
the bullet hit the train.

All right, good to go!

Bang.

NYPD.

I'd like to speak
with you, ma'am.

Can we come in, please?

Step back from the door,
please.

Did you hear any sort
of gunfire this morning?

DON'T TELL HIM ANYTING.

GIRL: Sure he heard it.

He fired it.

Stop right there.

Don't move.

WE HAVE TO TELL HIM.

YOU BE QUIET!

No, I won't be quiet, Appa.

What happened?

Last night, my boyfriend
spent the night.

So, this morning,
my father tried to kill him.

You sleep with my daughter
before marriage?!

Appa, Appa, stop it!

I love him, Appa, stop!

Was your boyfriend hit?

No, thank God. Why?

Someone else was.

Turn around, sir.

You're under arrest for the
death of Amos Delaware.

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

* The crows
brought the message *

* To the children of the sun 

* For the return
of the buffalo *

* And for a better day to come 

* You can kill my body 

* You can damn my soul 

* For not believing

* And some world down below 

* But you don't stand a chance *

* Against my prayers 

* You don't stand a chance *

* Against my love

* But we don't sing

Dr. Hawkes.

Tell Mac not to go
to the D.A. just yet.

What do you mean he didn't
die from a gunshot wound?

Well, here, see foyourself.

Ooh, that's sepsis.

SID: And my blood
work confirms it.

Our victim was dying
for several days

before he finally expired
from acute bacterial

infection on that train.

Hang on, you're telling me

that a bullet managed to hit
the one man on a speeding train

who was already dead?
I know.

Worse odds than Atlantic City.

Yeah, but he looks like
he was in awfully good shape

to dierom natural causes--

bacterial or otherwise.

Well, as my Lithuanian
grandmother used to say,

 <i>"Kame rya sviesos,</i>
 <i>ten it seseliu esti."</i>

"Where there is light,
there must also be shadows."

Oh, she drove me nuts.

Anyway, I found several
small perforations

through the outer wall
of his small intestine.

See these around the jejunum?

Definitely would've
caused the sepsis.

Any external wounds?

Ase from these superficial
splinters I pulled

from a contusion
on his thigh,

not a one.

Maybe he swallowed something
without knowing it?

Well, if he did,
his esophagus

certainly shows
no sign of trauma.

And nothing turned up
 along his G.I. tract

on the X ray.
Come on, Sid.

You gotta be blowing smoke here.

I wish I were.

But now that you mention it.

Check out his lung tissue.

It's rainbow colored.

Some kind of inhaled
particulate, I suppose.

And they both look the same.

Yeah, but that wouldn't
have caused his sepsis

any more than those splinters.

No.

But until I go digging through
the depths of his septic bowels,

I'm afraid all Ian tell
you is that, in my own gut,

his death doesn't feel
self-inflicted.

Is that your way
of asking for help?

Well, if there is
something in his body

too radiolucent
for an X ray to pick up

and you did decide to run

a high-res 3D-CT,

it would help save me
the extra time and trouble

of poking through 30 feet
of gastrointestinal tract.

I'll take that as a yes.

I'm tracing the wounds
along his G.I. tract.

The wounds stop here.

You seeing what I'm seeing, Sid?

Uh... yeah.

Just below the descending colon.

Yeah, almost.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Okay.

Find anything?

Yeah.

But what the hell kind
of murder weapon is this?

What do you think
about the name Louie?

I think he's going
to grow up to be a bookie.

How about Clemenza?

Influenza.

The kids on the playground
will call him a virus.

Ooh, easy.

Alfonse?

What'd you do, go through
the cast list of <i>Godfather II?</i>

No, these are names of
people in my family.

Messer.

All right.

Yeah, I'll be right there.

I got to go to the vic's
hotel room with Stella.

Listen, you got plenty of time
on this name search.

I mean,
the kid's not even here yet.

My mom and dad
waited six weeks

after I was born to name me.

Oh, they waited six weeks
to name you Sheldon?

Yeah. What's wrong with that?

No, that's cool.

That's a great name.

I'll see you later, Sheldon.



This was his room?

Indeed, it was.

MESS:
Whoa, whoa.

What are they
doing here, buddy?

Their jobs.

Is that a problem?

Yes, actually, it is.

 <i>Señora,</i>

 <i>para, por favor,</i>

 <i>el limpiar para ahora.</i>

Uh, please, sir.

Don-Don't touch that.

But I have to pack
this stuff up.

Mr. Connover is
the hotel's

information technology
consultant.

The computer did not belong
to Mr. Delaware.

All the same, we'd like you
to leave everything

where it is right now
for the time being, thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Connover,
that will be all.

I'm sorry.

Are you telling me this room is
some kind of crime scene?

We'll let you
know when we do.

Okay?
Thank you.

All right, so we know our
little black mystery pick

is what killed him.

He died on a rush hour train.

This could be
where he had his last meal.

Yeah, with all the traffic
coming through here

since then,
let's hope we're not too late.

This looks like some kind
of journal Amos was keeping.

Amos... Amos.

I like the name Amos.

I wonder if this writing is
Montiquan.

Amos...
Daniel...

Messer.

Danny, at some point,
you might want

to consider the
possibility that you

and Lindsay could have a girl.

My mom had two boys,
her mom had three boys.

I'm gonna have a boy.

 <i>Otan asprisi o kokoras.</i>

According to this,
the Montiquans shared

a meal of
oysters

to settle disputes.

I mean, this stuff is
hundreds of years old.

It should be protected,
you know, and preserved.

Maybe that's what this was for.

Montiquan National
Cultural Center.

There are very few
tribal members still left.

From what I know,
a few hundred years ago,

the Montiquans were a
thriving, peaceful people.

This look peaceful to you?

No, sure doesn't.

It just looks like
Delaware had some big plans

for his little tribe.

Yeah, and if that's true,

how come it all ended up
in a wastebasket?

And what dispute were they
trying to solve with oysters?

Well, I hope you can
sew this button ba on.

I've had some practice
with stitches.

Meanwhile,
I think I figured out

what this mystery pick is
that Sid pulled

 <i>from our vic's gut.</i>

 <i>I ran it through GCMS</i>

and it spiked for keratin,

but it isn't any kind
of bone or antler

from a land-dwelling mammal.

According to DNA,
it's baleen.

Baleen?

From a whale's mouth?

Yep, and if you ask me,

this is how it got from there
to our vic's intestines.

The baleen would have been
too long and sharp

and difficult to swallow
like this, but...

if you could
somehow

fold it over
and tie it like this,

it'd be a lot easier to swallow.

In an oyster, maybe.
Yeah, with
a little Worcestershire

or cocktail sauce.

Now,

once it's taken a nice bath

in your gastric acids...

Ouch.

Instant bellyache.

Explains
how it might have ended up

passing through his GI tract.

It also confirms it
wasn't an accident.

Somebody tied it up
and fed ito him.

But the use and sale of baleen
is strictly controlled

by the Marine Mammal
Protection Act,

so I looked for a list of
possible sources in the city

and found one.

Agra Imports in Jackson Heights.

Hey, Mac.

I ran a Lexis/Nexis search

on the address
from those blueprints

 <i>that we found</i>
 <i>at Delaware's place.</i>

 <i>Turns out he was involved</i>

in a pretty heated
property dispute.

4024 Radford was
apparently on land

once oed by the
Montiquan Tribal Nation.

Until it was
reclaimed

by the Bureau of Indian
Affairs in the 1800s.

Right.

Only last year,
Amos found a sympathetic judge

who agreed that the BIA
had brok a treaty.

He was willing to deed the
land back to the Montiquans,

so this prompted
the previous owner

to file suit against the chief
and his entire tribe.

And who are they?

Agra Imports

in Jackson Heights.

That's the same place
that imports baleen.

Don Flack.

Just the guy
I need to see.

 <i>Namaste.</i>

How you doing?

You the owner
of Agra Imports?

Third generation.

Leila Vara.
How can I help you?

Maybe you can tell us
about your property dispute

with Amos Delaware and
the Montiquan Indian Nation.

That matter has been resolved.

I guess death has a
way of doing that.

I'm sorry?

We believe Chief
Delaware was murdered

and you might be able to tell us
something about it.

 <i>Hai Bhagwaan.</i>

I knew nothing about it.

You named him
in a lawsuit

over the land seized from you
by the state.

I did, indeed.

It may not seem like much
to you and that judge in Albany,

but that property was given
to me by my grandfather.

He used to run this
very business there.

But am not an
immigrant like he was.

I am an American citizen
born in this city

and I know what my rights are.
Do they include

gutting Amos Delaware
with a piece of baleen?

You import that,
to don't you?

In certain pieces of
ceremonial art, yes.

I can assure you I no longer had

That's not what the suit says.

No, you don't understand.

He gave the land back.

He came in here two days ago

and he said
that he needed to talk.

You've got a lot of
nerve coming in here.

You going to try
and take this property, too?
Wait, wait, wait.

Listen.

I made a mistake.

LEILA:
 <i>He said</i>
 <i>that by gaining the land,</i>

 <i>that his tribe had lost</i>
 <i>its integrity,</i>

 <i>that he'd have an attorney</i>
 <i>draw up the papers</i>

 <i>and he'd give it back.</i>

 <i>He even apologized.</i>

Check out his lung tissue.

HAWKES:
It's rainbow colored.

And when he walked out the door,

I'm telling you,
he seemed almost relieved.

All the same, we're going
to have to confiscate

every piece of baleen that
you're selling in the store.

Look, you can take
everything that you want,

but you're gonna have
to take my word along with it.

I was angry at a lot of people

over what happened
to my family's property,

but I believe deeply in karma,

and somehow,
I think that man did, too.

Think she's lying?

Well, he did die before
he gave her the deed back,

but it's up to our
friends back at the lab

to keep her motive alive.

What do you say?
Want to head back?

Sure, but mind if we go
a less colorful route this time?

Noroblem.

Oh, heads up.
Come here.

You've got some shmutz
on you.
Oh.

Hey!

Yeah.

You, too.

NYPD blue.

c, you got a second?

What's up?

What do you think
about the name Kurt?

That's, uh...
That's German origin.

Means courageous, I think.

Really?
Yeah.

I like that name.
any of these names
Have you with Lindsay?

Yeah. I mean, no.

I mean, not yet.

I'm kind of just
doing my homework.

Me, too.

Right. Right.
I'm sorry.

What are we looking
at, 4024 Radford?

Yeah. These are two
separate satellite images.

One from a year ago.

And a second,
six months old.

Tell me what the difference is
between the two.

Hmm, fencing
has been added.

It's an air conditioning
unit atop the building.

Service vehicle out front.

Clearly,

some activity has
been going on.

But otherwise, it's
just another building

in a three
square-mile area.

Wait, wait a second.

I've seen this land before.

Yeah.

This is a painting from

Delaware's place.

A few hundred
years ago,

this was the Montiquan
ancestral home.

Good catch.

So, what's it being used for
now?

I don't know, but I
think we should take

a closer look.

NOTICE SPOVEREIGN PROPERTY OF THE
MONTIQUAN INDIAN NATION.
NO ACCESS PERMITTED.

TAYLOR:
This is as close
as we're gonna get

without a federal
warrant.

It's hard to believe

the Montiquans used
to own half the waterfront,

and this is all they got left.

Looks like brand new
fiber optic connection.

Put in a call
to the telecom company.

See if you can find out
what they're feeding.

This ground may be sacred,

BUT ???

Brushing up on your ABCs?

Uh, actually, I'm trying
to learn Chief Delaware's.

Outside of a few common
American Indian characters,

this strange writing

in his journal is
completely unique.

And if it's
Montiquan, I-I...

I'm thinking that he was
the last person le

to actually speak it.

Some Nive American populations
have gotten so fractured

that their languages
are actually endangered.

Yeah?

Well, I think
this one died with him.

There are a few
other words here

that are similar to other
tribal equivalents.

"Uncertainty.
Anger. Pain."

He was obviously upset
about something.

And one word appears
over and over,

and I can't for the life of me

figure out what it means.

"Tehonzuk."

You're on your own there.

Thanks, Danny.

Come on. You're trying
to tell me something.

It's just lost in translation.

 <i>Sliotar. Caman.</i>

 <i>Sliotar...</i>
Adam?

What are you
talking about?

Uh, sorry.

Uh, this is a Sliotar,
and this is a Caman.

And both are used
in the Gaelic game of hurling.

Ah. The playing field
on the Montiquan property.

Mac asked me to follow up on it.
Then I analyzed the splinter

 <i>that Sid pulled</i>
 <i>from Chief Delaware's thigh.</i>

Turns out to be ash wood.

 <i>But not just any ash wood--</i>

 <i>Irish ash wood from Ireland.</i>

So once I paired it to the shape
and size of his leg contusion,

I started thinking, you know,

it might have been caused
by a caman like this.

Used by a cretin like this.

It's Finn Wexford, captain
of the Queens Hurling Club

and proud recipient
of an A-misdemeanor

for cruelty to animals.

What does this mean to us?

Well, apparently,
Mr. Wexford didn't like

stray dogs leaving messes
on his practice field,

so, like any good boy
from the Old Country,

he stuffed nails
inside of hamburger meat

and took care
of the problem.

But that was last year.

This year, he got
his practice field taken away

when the Montiquans
reclaimed their land.

LOOK

POLICE

SMELL

What do you think,
you're

the only one whose grandpa
taught him a little Irish?

You're interrupting a game.
FLACK:
Yeah.

I'm surprised to see that.

Didn't the chief
of the Montiquan Nation tell you

that you needed
to find a new practice field?

He doesn't belong.
I think he got that message
loud and clear.

Meaning?

He's dead.

Don't pretend
like you don't kn.

Okay, look,

the guy already
came by here once

telling us we had to
find a new place to play.

Then he shows
up again.

I tell him
we aren't going anywhere.

It gets heated.

My ancestors were here
before you.

Well, perhaps you'd like
to join them then?

Look, I just came
to say you can stay.

Why should we believe you?

I really don't care
what you believe, sissy.

Well, you damn
well better.

Because I believe

that you wanted to make sure
he wouldn't change his mind,

and so you gave him
the stray dog treatment.

Am I right?
What'd you do

Take him out for lunch,
and add a little extra kick

into his corned beef
and cabbage?

What are you accusing  of?

What are you denying?

Okay, now that you've
harassed an officer,

why don't we head back
to our playing field downtown?

Sound good to you, Flack?

MY PLEASURE.

The splinters are a
match to the caman,

and Wexford's prints
are all over 'em.

But priors aside, we can't
connect him in any way

to the baleen that
killed Chief Delaware.

And none of the items
that Flack and Angell

took from Leila Vara match

what Hawkes and Sid found
in Delaware's gut.

Hold on a second.
This might help.

According to carbon dating,
our murder weapon

is over 300 years old.

BONASERA:
Gentlemen, I give you
the Wolfkiller.

Centuries ago,
the Montiquans carved

and folded sharp strips
of baleen,

tied them up tightly
with catgut cord,

and tucked them
into chunks of raw meat.

Then they deftly scattered
their murder weapons

in the wilderness of Manhattan

to kill wolves,
wild boar and bears.

Not to mention Indian Chiefs.

TAYLOR:
Somebody obviously

blew the dust off this one
and put a new spin on it.

Hmm.
Let's get
a list

from the Bureau of Indian
Affairs of all living

members of the
Montiquan Nation.

You think Chief Delaware
might have actlly been killed

by one of his own?

Well, I can tell you this much.

Whoever took this weapon
from his room

not only knew
how to use it,

but who they were using it on.

Sounds like
a pretty painful betrayal.

BONASERA:
Maybe the Montiquans weren't

such a peaceful tribe after all.

Hey, okay, according to the BIA,

there's a handful
of Montiquan
tribal members

still living in Oklahoma.

Aside from Chief Delaware,

there's only one
registered member

in the New York City area.

That's a Liam Connover.

 <i>Mr. Connover is the hotel's</i>

 <i>information technology</i>
 <i>consulnt.</i>

Connover?

That's the name of the I.T. guy.

The one that was trying
to take the computer

out of Chief Delaware's room.

So, what didn't he
want you to see?

Welcome to the real Montiquan
Nation Cultural Center.

An online gambling site?

That's what's going on
inside our warehouse.

Poker Native.com.

And the telecom
company confirmed

that high speed
fiber optic lines

were installed at the warehouse.

And the industrial cooling unit

is consistent with
what it would take

to maintain ideal temps

for server storage.

So, we did a littlepacket sniffing.

Packet sniffing?

What our little
beardefriend

from the Tech Republic
is trying to say is

that we use a subpoena

to, uh, analyze the
data between the servers

and the network users.

It's basically like
bugging a phone

except we digitally figured out

what was going on
inside the warehouse

without actually goingn.

According to this log in window,
this site is currently hosting

884 games just like
this around the world.

I thought it was against the law

to run online gambling
operations in the U.S.

MAC: It is, but some
Native American tribes

have started taking advantage
of their sovereign land statat

to build sites like this

instead of expensive brick
and mortar casinos.

Sounds like some
grey legal ground.

Yeah, not only that, but from
what we've learned about him,

Chief Delaware was all about

preserving the integrity
of his tribe.

It just doesn't seem like he
would front something like this.

HAWKES: But why not?

Even if running
a gambling operation

was hard for him
to swallow at first,

in this day and age,

it can go a long way

to promoting pride
and especially prosperity

for all kinds
of Native Americans.

How's he able to bankroll
something like this?

Well, according to the telecom
company, he didn't.

A firm called LCV paid for it.

LIAM CONNERVER VENTURES

Oh, we gotta find out
STELLwhere this guy is now.res.

I think he's right there.

TAYLOR:
Adam, run an IP address
on this player,

LCV.

Then, tell me:
Why in the world would he

fold on a full house...

LCV:MAN, U GUYS ARE GONNA HERT.

unless he's cheating?

OkayHe's alone.here.

Don, turn your light off.

TAYLOR:
Danny, hold still.

TAYLOR:
Don't move.

TAYLOR:
Psst.

 <i>Tehonzuk.</i>

Cheater.

That's what it means,

doesn't it?

It's the best translation
I can offer

for the combination
of "game" and easel".

Sounds about right to me.

You don't know
what you're talking about.

Then, why don't you educate us?

Just like Chief Delaware
tried to do for you, Liam.

I didn't care about any
of that old-school crap.

All I know is
he asked me to set up

a gambling site.

As a means
to an end.

He just wanted
to raise the funds

to renovate that warehouse
into a cultural center

for the tribe.
Except you moved in

and got greedy.

TAYLOR:
 <i>Then, Chief Delaware caught you</i>

 <i>cheating dozens of people</i>
 <i>out of thousands of dollars.</i>

In small increments,

it probably didn't
seem like much to you.

We might not have even
caught it ourselves

without our computers
searching every winning hand

of the pasthree months.

BONASERA:
To Chief Delaware,
that cost was immense,

so he confronted you.

Wanted to settle the dispute
the way your ancestors had.

It's not right!

Relax, it's just a game.

To you, maybe.

 <i>Tehonzuk.</i>

After all the time
I've spent with you,

have you learned nothing
of our history?

I'll give the land back

before I allow this tribe
to be disgraced.

Okay, you're right.

I'm sorry.

I'll clean
this mess up.

I promise.

TAYLOR:
 <i>Unfortunately for you,</i>

sepsis takes a little while
to kill someone.

BONASERA:
So, Chief Delaware
used that time

to try to make
things right,

while your actions caused him
a slow and painful death.

He was already ancient h h
