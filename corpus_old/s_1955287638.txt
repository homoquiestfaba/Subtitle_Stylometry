[Babbling,
Giggling]

Oh, I Can't Wait Till

Ha Ha Ha!

It's The Big Time,
Bobby.

Do You Know
What It Means To

That Means You'll Stink.

It Means The Name
Oscar Proud

Will Go Down
In History

Alongside The Great
Snack Innovators
Of All Time.

Danny Dorito,
Freddy Frito,
Polly Pringle.

You Ever Heard
Of Them?

Uh--Uh--Uh...No.

That's 'Cause

[Man Clears Throat]

Jumping...

Peanuts?

Dr. Carver?

Artificially Intelligent
Jumpin' Peanuts.

Imagine The Possibilities.

Hmm. As You Know, Doctor...

In Order To
Gain Acceptance
Into The Academy...

A Candidate
Must Demonstrate

Exceptional Innovations
In The...

Field Of Snack
Technology.

Man: I'm Sure You've Heard
Of Pudding In A Cup.

<I> I Thought Of The Cup.

[Excited Chatter]

Very Nice Invention.

The Cup? Oh,
That Was You.

You'd Better Recognize.

Well, You See, The Problem
With Your Research Is...

It's Always About...

Peanuts.

Peanuts Are Played Out.

Done.

They're PassÃ©.

How Can You Say That?!

I'm Afraid We're Going To

To Deny Your Membership...

All: Again.

Let's Go, Boys.

You Will Regret
This Decision!

Trust Me, Gentlemen,
The Time Is Coming

When Peanutkind Will
Finally Get The Respect

They Deserve!

[Nervous Laugh]

If The Board
Accepts Me,

I'll Finally
Be Recognized

For My Important
Contributions
To Snackology.

Whoa!


Man, Would You
Watch Out!

You Fool!

Party People,
Make Some Noise!

Here Comes Oscar Proud,
Inventor Of...

The New And Improved...

Porknut!

Half Pork And Half Nut.

â™ª But It's All, All,

â™ª Well, It's Good â™ª

And Behold!

My Special Kicking Donkey
Dipping Sauce.

Not Only Does It Add
A Potent, Zesty Flavor,

But It Locks In The Potent,
Nutty Freshness, Too.

That Way You Never
Have To Worry About
An Expiration Date.

I Just Add A Teeny-Weeny
Drop Of This,

And...

[Porknut Hissing]

[Porknut Gurgling]

Huh?

Look Out!

[Porknuts Raining Down Inside]

Ok, Did I Say
"Dippin' Sauce"?

I Meant To Say,
Uh, Uh...

Behold. My Instant,
Everlastin'

Porknut Multiplyin'
Formula.

â™ª Instant,
Everla-- â™ª

What Was That
Last Part?

Just Roll With It, Bobby.

Uhh--Aah...

Membership Denied!

Get Him Out Of Here!

Wait, Wait.
Didn't You Hear
What I Said?!

They're Everlastin'!

There's No
Expiration Date.

These Porknuts
Never Go Bad.

Proud, They Never Go Good!

See That, Boys?

An Everlastin'
Multiplyin' Formula.

Perhaps That's What
We've Been Looking For.

Ha Ha Ha Ha
Ha Ha Ha Ha.

Oscar: [Loudly]
But Trudy...

Trudy: Oscar, Quiet Down.

You'll Wake The Twins.


Penny, That You?

Without My Man.

All Right, Then.
Ponytail,

Hit That Button

Dijonay: [Shouting]

Heh Heh Heh Heh Heh.

This Time You've Gone
Too Far, Penny Proud.

Not Only Are You

Indefinitely?!

What About
My Birthday Party?

Canceled!
In Fact,

You Whole Birthday

And Until You Learn
To Show Some Respect,

You're Not Even Allowed
To Turn 16!

Oscar, Isn't That
A Little Unreasonable?

I Wish You Weren't
My Daddy.

What Did You Say?!

I Said I Wish
You Weren't My Daddy!

Well, Right Now I Wish
You Weren't My Daughter!

Penny: Aah!

Trudy, Where Did This Girl
Learn To Sass Me Like That?

Boy, Will You
Shut Up?!

I'm Tryin'
To Concentrate
On My Sweepstakes.

Mmmuuah!

Come On, Lady Luck.

I Can't Believe
That Girl.

It's Like I Don't
Even Know Her Anymore.

I Even Picked Up
A Special Birthday Present

For Her And Everything.

Honey, Let Me
Talk To Her.

[Easy Rhythm Playing]

[Knock Knock Knock]

Go Away!

I Come In Peace.

Unh!

Here. I Thought
You Might Like

To See This.

Ooh...What Is It?

A Special
Birthday Present...

From Your Father.

Uhh! No,
Thank You.

Oh, Penny, Baby,

Your Father Loves You
And Only Wants The Best
For You.

Even If He Has
A Funny Way

Of Showing It
Sometimes.

What's Funny?
Canceling My
Birthday?

Embarrassing Me
In Front Of My
Friends?

Never Letting Me
Do What I Want?

Oh, Yeah, Dad's
A Real Comedian.
Ha Ha.

â™ª Even Though
It's Twice The Price â™ª

You'll Pay!

â™ª Make The Perfect Sacrifice â™ª

â™ª Shake Your Booty
In Paradise â™ª



Yeah, Man!


Oh, Penny, Don't You
Just Love This
Tropical Music?

Whatever.

Well, I'll Bet
You'll Love
This Tune.

â™ª Happy, Happy Birthday â™ª

â™ª Happy Birthday â™ª

â™ª Happy Birthday To You â™ª

Make A Wish,
Sweetie.

I Wish...

I Wish I Could Dance
In The Halftime Show
With 15 Cent.

Please, Daddy?

Forget It.
Wish Again.

[Bebe, Cece Giggling]

Then I Wish I Was
Away From You

And This Stupid Island!

And Kissing 15 Cent!

Trudy: Oh, Penny...

What's Cookin',
Good Lookin'?

Uh, The Word Bacon
Comes To Mind.

Um, Ms. Proud,
The Traditional
Island Attire

Suits You Well.

One Could Say
You Put The "Moo"
In Muumuu.

[Cows Mooing]

I Think He Likes Me.

Mr. Proud, Perhaps
I Can Interest You

In A Private Tour
Of My Estate.

Absolutely!

You Know, You Look
Real Familiar
To Me.

Have We Met?

I Don't Think We Have.

No, I'm Sure
I've Seen You
Somewhere.

And Your Face--
You Were Singin'
And Dancin' And--

And You Was Actin'
And Rappin'.

I Got It. You Were
In<I> Breakin' Ii:
Electric Boogaloo.

You Boogaloo Shrimp!

No, No, No.
How 'Bout<I>
Beat Street?

<I> Beat Street. 
King Of The Street.

Rrrrah!

I Wish I Could Drive.

I Wish I Could Stay Up
All Night.

Ooh, And I Wish
This Grass Skirt

Didn't Give Me
This Rash.

[Bushes Rustling]

Who's There?!

Don't Mess With Me,
Y'all!

Huh?

How Do?

Cashew,
You Scared Me!

I Was Just Checking
To See If You Were Ok.

You Seem Upset.

Yeah.

It's A Long Story.

Well, If You Want
To Tell It,

I'm All Ears.

Actually, I'm All Head,

But, Heh, You Know
What I Mean.

Well, It All Started
On My Third Birthday.

Daddy Didn't Want
To Pay For A Clown.

He's So Cheap Sometimes.

So He Dressed Up
In Suga Mama's
Nightgown...

So Embarrassed...
And When I Turned 4,

Mom Hired Thingy
For My Birthday.

Thingy And Daddy
Got Into An Argument,

And Then Thingy
Dropkicked Daddy.

Now Today's
My 16th Birthday.

It's Supposed To Be
The Best Day
Of My Life, Right?

Right. But My Dad Said
I Couldn't Audition

To Be A Spare Change
Dancer,

Even Though All
My Friends Could.

So I Snuck Out
And Went Anyway

And Got Busted
Kissin' 15 Cent,

So My Parents
Canceled My
Birthday Party

And Dragged Me
On This Trip,

And Now My Big Day
Is Ruined Because

My Dad Keeps
Treatin' Me
Like A Baby!


Well, That Really Is
A Long Story.

You Know What It Is,
Cashew?

Sometimes...I Just Wish
I Had Different Parents.

I Think You're Lucky.

I Wish I Had Parents.

Oh, I'm Sorry.

I'm Goin' On And On
About My Problems,

And I Didn't Even
Realize That--

It's Ok.

Here On The Island,

We're Kinda Like
One Big Nutty Family.

But There's Times
When I Wonder

What It Would Be Like
To Have A Real Mom And Dad.

Well,
I'll Tell You What.

If You Ever Wanna Wear

A Burgundy Sweater
And Skirt

For The Rest Of Your Life,

You Can Try Having
My Parents.

Hey, Nice Crib, Doc.

Well, Thank You.

Care For
A Pistachio?

Ha Ha Ha.

You're My Kind Of Man,
Mr. Proud.

We're Like
2 Intellectual Peas
In A Pod.

2 Nuts
In The Same Shell.

You See, Like Yours,

My Genius
Has Never Received
Its Proper Recognition.

In Fact,

I've Been Working
On A Revolutionary
New Concept--

Friendly
Humanoid Peanuts.

It Will Attend
To Our Every Need.

Just Think Of
The Possibilities,
Mr. Proud.

They Could Care
For The Elderly.

Look After Our Children.

Take Over The World!

I Mean, Make Over
The Squirrels.


I See The Future,
Mr. Proud,

And It's Nuts.

Ah, But The Prototypes
Aren't Turning Out
As I Had Hoped.

They Won't Stabilize.

It's Like I Need A...
Oh, I Don't Know,

Instant Everlasting
Multiplying Formula
Or Something.

Stop Playing.

I Created
An Instant Everlasting
Multiplying Formula.

Maybe We Could Be Partners.

As Suga Mama Always Told Me,

2 Geniuses Are Better
Than One Halfwit.

Partners?

Sounds Intriguing,

But I Don't Know If
I Could Offer You Much
For Your Expertise.

Maybe Only...

$10 Million?

$10--10--10--10--10 Million?

Blaaah-Aa-Ahh!

Ahem. I Mean That's
A Rather Intriguing Offer.

I'll Have To Discuss It
With My Wife.

Ha Ha Ha Ha.

Excellent!

Then I Can Expect
Your Answer
In The Morning?

That's Right.

Ha Ha Ha! Oh. Ooh.

Trudy! Trudy!

Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha.

Oh, Romeo Pistachio,

Come Back! Come Back!

Today's Forecast Calls
For Dry And Roasted.

[Continues Changing Channels]

This Local Cable
Station Stinks.

Puff, How About A Dip
In The Jacuzzi?

Trudy!

We're Gonna Be Rich!

We're Gonna Be Rich,
Baby.

Oscar--

Dr. Carver
Offered Me

$10 Million
To Be His Partner.

$10 Million?

What Kind Of Jungle Punch
Did You Drink At The Luau?


Penny, Where Have You Been?

It's Well Past Your Curfew,
Young Lady.

Relax, Mom. I
Was Just Hanging Out
With Cashew.

What? You Know
What I Told You About
Hanging Out With Boys.

You Are A Boy,
Ain't You?

Trudy: Oscar.

Fine. Let's Go Home,
And I Can Hang Out
With My Friends.

Hey, Whoa!

'Cause They--

That's Quite Enough,
You Two!

Now, Look, We're Gonna Start
Acting Like A Family

And Have Fun On This Vacation
Right Now,

Do You Hear Me?

Yes.

Yes.

Do You Hear Me?!

Yes, Ma'am!

Yes, Ma'am!

You Looking For Me,
Carvey?


Uh, Hello, Miss Suga.
Good-Bye, Miss Suga.

Wait, Wait, Wait.
Get Him, Puff,
And Hit The Legs.


â™ª Poetry â™ª

â™ª I've Got To Keep You
Pleased In Every Way I Can â™ª

â™ª Gonna Give You All Of Me... â™ª

Ahh!

Ak-Aah!

â™ª I'm Never Gonna Give You Up â™ª


You Can't Join Suga Mama
In The Hot Tub?

The Water Is Just Right.


Uh, Thanks, But--Oh.

I'm Not Wearing
My Swim Trunks.

Well, What
A Coincidence.

Neither Am I.


Oh, No.

[Suga Mama Laughs]

Penny. Penny?

Sorry, Y'all. Big Sis Needs
A Vacation From This Vacation.

See Ya.



Time To Get Rich.

[Twig Snaps]

Who's There?

Over Here.

[Nervous Laugh]

If You're Looking
For Someone To Rob,

I Know An Old Lady
With A Poodle Who's Loaded.

I'll Even Help You
Take Her Down.

Aah!

My Name's Wally.
And You Are In Danger!

No! You're In Danger!

'Cause I Ain't Afraid
To Beat Up No Kid.

Listen. You Need To
Get Off This Island.

Whatever You Do,
Don't Give Dr. Carver
Your Formula.

He's Planning To Take
Over The World--Aah!

Mr. Proud,
There You Are.

Listen, Last Night,
The Most Amazing Thing
Popped Into My...


Aaah!

Oh, There's Gotta Be
A Way Off Of This Island!

I'm So Happy You Decided
To Accept My Offer,
Mr. Proud.

Here's To Being
Partners.

50-50.

Ha Ha Ha. How About
That Little Thing We Was
Talking About? You Know...

Starts With A 10,
Ends With A Million Dollars?

The Money, Of Course.

Fellas. [Claps]

It's All Yours,
Mr. Proud.

Ooh, Baby! Heh.
I Think I'm Gonna Need
A Bigger Wallet.

But First, Ha Ha Ha,

The Everlasting Formula,
Please.

Whatever You Do,

Do Not Give
Dr. Carver
Your Formula.

Tell You What, Doc.

I'll Be Your Partner,
50-50.

But The Secret Formula
Stays On My 50. Deal?

Heh Heh. Mr. Proud,
Give Me The Formula.

Please!

I, Uh, Can't Do That.

I Don't Have It With Me
On The Island.

I Keep It In
A Very Special Place.

Now, If You'll Excuse Me,

I Have A Very Large Check
To Cash.

By The Way, Is There
An Atm On The Island?

I Have Been
A Very Patient Man.

I Want My Formula!
Give It! Give It!
Give It! Give It!

Uh, Doc,
You Got Something Funny
Going On With Your Nose.

I Have Ways Of
Finding Things Out,
Mr. Proud.

Sinister Ways.

Aah!

Give Me
The Tickle Chair.

No! Not The Tickle Chair!

Aah!

Ah Ha Ha Ha!

Aah! Ha Ha Ha!

Ha Ha. Stop It.
Ha Ha!

Tell Me Where You've
Hidden The Formula.

Hee Hee. Ha Ha.
Never!

Aaggh. Peanuts.

Tell Me Where You Hid...

Aah! Aah!

The Formula!

Never!

Give Me The Formula.

I Want That Formula!
Give It! Give It! Give It!

â™ª All Around
The Living Room â™ª

â™ª The Boys And Girls
Are Singing... â™ª

I Must Say I'm Impressed By
Your Resilience, Mr. Proud.

But If You Won't Give Me
That Formula,

Then You Leave Me No Choice.

Bring In The Clones.

Clones?

Last Night While
You And Your Loved Ones
Enjoyed The Luau,

My Servants Surreptitiously
Collected A Few
Of Your Personal Items.

When I Combine
Your Proud Family Dna

With My Patented Peanut
Cloning Technology,

The Result...Will Have
You Seeing Double.

What The--

Clones?

Well, Wait, Wh--
They Just Like The Real Thing.

Exactly.

Except There's
One Difference.

Yii!

Aah!

Clones, Synchronize
Yourselves.

You Have 48 Hours

To Retrieve The Instant
Everlasting Formula
And Complete Your Mission.

Yes, Dr. Carver.

Yes, Dr. Carver.

What About Me
And My Family?

You And Your Family
Are Gonna Stay Here

And Enjoy Your Deluxe
Island Vacation...

Forever!

Do We Have Everything
We Need For The Mission?


My Wristwatch
Video Communicator...

I Must Go Back
And Get It.

We're Finally Leaving?!

Oh, Thank You.
Thank You. Thank You!

Did You Synchronize
Your Wristwatch?

My Watch?

Yeah. It Says It's Time
To Roll Up Out Of Here,

So Let's Bounce.

What Is The Meaning
Of This "Roll Up
Out Of Here"?

It Means It's Time To Go,
Mama, Duh.

Tape: Hello.
How Are You, My Friend?

Second Voice: Yo, Yo.
We're Scruga-Lugga,
Homey.

What's Up, Y'all?
What We Waiting For?

You're Supposed
To Drive.

It's Your Mission
Assignment.

Duh.

Me? You Want Me To Drive?

You Never Let Me Drive.

Is This Some Kind Of Joke?
Where's The Hidden Camera?

I Would Never Joke
About The Mission.

Ha Ha. Ok.
Thank You, Daddy.

I'm A Really Good Driver.
You'll See. [Giggles]

All Right,
Adjust The Mirror.

Hands At 10:00 And 2:00.

And Ease Away From The Curb.

Oops!

Sorry. My Bad.

And I Was Like,
Hey, The Secret Formula
Stays On My 50,

And He Was All, Like,
Give Me The Formula.

And I Was, Like, No Can Do.
And He Was, Like,

Well, Bring Out
The Clones.
I Was, Like,

Clones?! Whatcha Talkin'
About, Clones?

Wham! Bam!
Out Step The Clones.

Look Just Like Us.

Except For Mama.
Even More Hideous.

Twice The--

Stop Talking Nonsense,
Boy.

I'm Telling You It's True!

We Gotta Get Out
Of This Place!

Hey! Penny!
Rise And Shine, Sweetie.

Vacation's Over.

Aah! Where'd She Go?

Ah. Ah. Ah. Uh. Uh.
Ok, Listen.

No Time To Pack.
I'll Get Us Out Of Here
And Find Penny.

Ok. Now It's Time To Panic.

Help Us! Help!

If You Want To Survive,
You Must Come With Me.

Immediately.

What?

Everyone Is Gone!

Must Alert Dr. Carver.

Penny! There You Are.

Oh, Penny!

Hmm? Have You Been
Eating Peanut Butter
Or Something?

We Must Hurry. We've Got
To Get To The Other Side
Of The Island.

There Is Only One Person
Who Can Help You Now.

Is This A New Part
Of The Mission?

Uh, Yeah. We're On A Mission
To Save Our Necks.

Now Let's Move!

Penny, I Need You
To Carry The Twins,

And Don't Give Me No Lip.

[Twins Giggle]

Now, That's More
Like It.

It's About Time
That Girl Started
Listening To Me.

Ah.

Quickly. We Are Almost
To The Summit.

Oscar?

Whoa! Oh.

Oscar, Don't Panic.

Ok. I Told You, Trudy,
I Don't Like Heights.

Whoo! Aah!
Look Out There!

It's Not So Bad,
Son.

Unless You
Look Down.

Ha Ha Ha.

Aah! That's Not Funny,
Mama.

Ha Ha Ha Ha.

Penny, Be Careful
With The Twins Now.

That's Affirmative,
Mother.

Penny! Look Out!

Penny! Look Out!

Wii-Yii!

What In The--

Oscar. Did You
Just See...

1433. Ok, We're Here.

Your Monetarial
Compensation, Sir.

You May Retain
The Balance.

1,000 Bucks!

Thanks!

Family,
Primary Mission Begins
In T-Minus 3...2...1.


Hey, Pal.

Hey, Penny.

What's Up, P.?

How Was Your Trip?

Um...Bizarre.

Ever Since This Morning,
My Mom's Been Talking Like
She's Straight-Up Street.

Man, This Whip
Is Whack, Homey.

Where's The Secret
Formula, Yo?

And Suga Mama, I Can't
Even Understand Her.

<I> No Hay Nada En Esta Caja.

And My Dad's
Been Acting--

Daughter, Would You
Mind Holding
Our Currency?

Kinda Cool.

Well, I Bet He's
Still Not Cool Enough

To Let You Come To The
Dance Rehearsal Tomorrow.

Whatever, Lacienega.

I Feel You, Girl.

But As Spare Change
Dancers,

Got Some Pre-Rehearsal
Shopping To Do.

He-Ey!

He-Ey!

What Is It,
Daughter?

Come On, Dad.
Don't Rub It In.

You Know I'm
The Only One Who Can't Go
To The Dance Rehearsals.

Do You Think Your
Attendance Will Advance
Our Primary Mission?

Well, Uh, Yeah, I Think So.

Most Definitely.

Then Perhaps You
Should Participate.

For Real?!
Oh, Thank You.

You're The Best Daddy
In The Whole World!

What's Up, Oscar?

My Dawg.

Hello,
Felix Boulevardez,

Next Door Neighbor
And Friend.

Right. So...

Are We On For
The Stuffball Game
Tonight Or What?

It's The Semifinals,
Baby!

<I> Â¡Hasta La Lima!

Stuffball? Ooh,
That's My Game, Dawg.
Ya Heard Me?

Oscar, Are You Going
Tonight Or What?

One Moment Please,
While I Converse
With My Associates.

This Could Be
An Important
Fact-Finding Mission

To See What These
Neighbors Know About
The Secret Formula.

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.
That's A Real Spit, Homey.

I'm With It.

<I> Muy Bueno.

Felix Boulevardez,
Next Door Neighbor
And Friend,

We Accept Your
Invitation.

Invitation? No.
You're Paying
For These Tickets.

Here's Your Monetarial
Compensation.

Will $5,000
Cover Everything?

Oh, Ho Ho! Yes!

Ya, Y'all, Big Booooy
In The Hood!

Now, Don't Forget
Tomorrow Night

Is The Extreme
Stuffball Championships

With A Halftime Performance
From My Main Man 15 Cents.

Big Ups To All The Lucky
Little Mamas Who Made The Cut

To Join Me As
The Spare Change Dancers.

All Right, Now, Ooh, Wow,
Now Listen Up, Ladies.

Now You Girls Must Be
Supertalented, Superfly,

And You Must Have
A Supercool Dad.

Yes, I Do.

The Coolest.

This Is Some Vacation.

I'm Cold, I'm Tired,

My Ribs Are Still Hurting
From That Tickle Chair,

And I Am Hungry.

Mm-Mm.

Didn't Know Peanuts
So Tasty, Huh, Puff?

Mama! Where'd You
Get Those Peanuts?

I Cleaned Out The Minibar
Before We Left.

What? You Gotta Be Crazy.
Don't You Know How Much
That Stuff Cost?

I'll Give You $20
For A Bite.

Puff?


Here, Help Yourself.

Ugg-Yah!

Mama, That--That Is
Just Straight-Up Nasty!


Do You Need A Hand
With That?

What Are You Doing?

I Call It
Making A Move.

Aah. Ooh.

Making A Move Is Not
Part Of The Mission.

[Thuds And Grunts]

Oscar, Do You Notice
Anything Different
About Penny?

Yeah. She's Finally
Handling The Boys
The Way I Taught Her.

Oscar, She's Body-Slamming
That Poor Kid Against The Rock.

Well, Seems Like
She's Been Working Out.

But That's Just The Proud Blood
Pumping Through Her Veins.

You See, We're Strong People.

Hoom Shakalaka,
Hoom Shakalaka.<I>
Aequus, Aequus.

Uh-Huh. And She's Not
Complaining And Whining

Like She Always
Does Either.

That's In The
Proud Blood, Too.

Isn't That A Good Thing?

Oh, Oscar, It's Just...

My Little Girl's
Growing Up So Fast.

Before We Know It,
She'll Be Off
To College,

Then A Career, Marriage,
Grandkids...

Whoa, Ho Ho Ho.
Slow Down, Trudy.

Bebe And Cece Are Still
In Diapers And You
Talking About Grandkids?

I Know, It's Silly.

But In Some Ways,
I Think I'm Going To
Miss The Old Penny.

Well, I'm Gonna
Miss Things, Too.

Like Tonight.

I'm Missing The Wizard Kelly
Extreme Stuffball Semifinals.

I Bet Everybody's There
But Me.




Ok, Let Me Get
This Straight.

Your Dad, Oscar Proud,
Is Gonna Let You Be
A Spare Change Dancer?

I Told You.
My Daddy's Cool Now.

He Lets Me Do
Whatever I Want.

Whoa!
Nice Shoes!


My Mom Took Me Shopping
And Hooked Me Up.

[Cell Phone Rings]

Wait. Hang On, Lacienega.
It's D.

Hey, Girl.

Your Parents Bought
You A Polyphonic
Camera Phone?

I Don't Even Have
One Of Those.

Hey...Ooh.
Hang On, Penn.

Zoey's Hitting Me
On My 2-Way.

Heeeeyyyyy...

What's Up, Giiiiirl?

Hang On, Guys.
My Other Line's Beeping.

Hey, It's Dijonay.

Do You Believe
Penny's Mom Bought Her
A Camera Phone?

Stop Playing.
Penny, You Got A New Phone?

Yep. Check It Out.

Dang!

Dang!

Dang!

Yo, Yo, Pigeon,
Come On, Sister.

What's The 4-1-1 On
Oscar's Secret Formula?

Wiz Dome Dogs.

Get Your Red Hots.
Come And Get Your Dogs.

Yo, Oscar,
Are You Hungry?

I'll Get Us
Some Hot Dogs.

Hey, Yo!
2 Hot Dogs
Over Here.


Oscar, What Did You
Do That For?

Sorry About That, Man.
Couple More Dogs.

Here. Just Take
The Whole Thing.

Oh, My. This Is, Um,

Tasty!

P.A.: Whoo! That Was
Some Second Quarter.

And Now For Our
Halftime Entertainment,

Some Brave Man Out There
Will Get The Chance To Win...


12 Wizard Dollars

By Going One-On-One With
The Extreme Stuffball Champ...

Mayhem The Mangler, Y'all.

Any Takers?

[Crowd Cheers]

I Must Procure
More Hot Dogs.

P.A.: And There's Our Brave
Volunteer Right Now, Y'all.

I-Is That Oscar Proud?

Go, Oscar!

Penny! Penny!
That's Your Dad!

He's Gonna Get Mangled.

Oh, No!

[Low Growl]


Crowd: Mangler! Mangler!
Mangler! Mangler!

Where Ya Gonna Be When
Mayhem Mania Comes For Thee?!

Don't Worry, Penny.

I'm Sure Your Father
Will Be Ok.

It's All Fake.

Fake? Zoey, That Guy's
Gonna Devour My Daddy.

Cool.

Now, Here's The Rules.

Your Mission Is To Get The Ball
Into Your Opponent's Goal.

Other Than That, Just Try
Not To Get Too Much Blood

On The Wizard's Nice
Shiny Floor, Y'all.


I'm Gonna Bust You Up.

Primary Mission,
Put The Ball In
The Opponent's Goal.

Go For It. Rrrr!

Yee-Aaah!

Mayhem Mania!

Yo, What? No!

Wait A Second!
Yaaaahhh!

Oh, No--Not The Face!


Ay, Yi Yi!

Well, Oscar Proud,

What Are You Gonna
Do With All Them
Wizard Dollars?

Dang, Penny.
I've Never Seen
Your Dad So Hungry.

Your Mama
Don't Cook No More?

We Made It.

He Will Be Able
To Help You Now.

He? He Who?



Wally, You've Done
A Good Job.

Thank You, Father.

Father?
Listen, Man,

I Don't Know What Kind
Of Freaky Family Tree
You Fell From,

But From One Dad
To Another,

You Gotta Help Me, Man.

There's A Guy
On The Other Side
Of The Island,

And He's Crazy--
Dr. Carver. Looks Like
Boogaloo Shrimp!

I'm Telling You,
He Outta His Mind.

[Both Laugh]

Trust Me.
Dr. Carver Is Not Crazy.

What? How Do You Know?

Because I'm...

Dr. Carver.


Uh, You See, The Dr. Carver
You've Been Dealing With
Is In Fact My Clone.

Clone?

This Is A Portrait Of
My Great-Great-Grandfather--

George Washington Carver.

Is Anyone Here Familiar With
The Making Of A Peanut--

Ooh, Ooh.
Me. Me. Me.

Ooh Ooh Ooh.
I Got It.
I Got It.

Oops, Here We Go.

Ahem.

George Washington Carver,
1864 To 1943,

A Renowned Educated
Agricultural Researcher

Who Invented Over 300 Uses
For The Common Peanut

Including Shampoo,
Instant Coffee, And,
Of Course, Peanut Butter.

Very Good, Mr. Proud.

Ha Ha! Yeah, Baby!

In Your Face,
Suga Mama.

Shoo, You Can't
Tell Me Nothing.

I Know My Nuts, Now.

I Know You're Nuts, Too.


I Was Interested In
Peanut Research As Well.

Only Instead Of Butter
And Soap,

I Hoped To Create
A New Life Form
From The Peanut Genome.

So I Moved To This
Remote Island

And Began Experimenting
With Peanut Cloning
Technology.

My First Attempt
At Cloning...

Went Terribly Wrong.

I Had To Scrap
The Experiment And Turn 'Em
Into Peanut Butter.

All Except One.


My Second Round Of Experiments
Brought Me Closer To My Goal.

I Call These Friendly Creatures
The Genomes.

They've Become Like Family.

But I Longed For A Protege,
An Intellectual Equal,

Someone To Inherit
All That I Have Learned,

So I Mixed My Own Human Dna
Into The Experiment

And Attempted To Clone Myself.
It Was Truly A Success.

Unfortunately, One Day I
Left Him In The Sun Too Long,

And The Results
Were Disastrous.

Aah!

Don't Worry. It's Not
As Bad As You Think.

Ooh, I'm Gonna
Getcha.

I Only Wanted To Create
A Companion.

But Instead,
I Created A Monster.

Then What Happened?

He Went Bad.

Literally.

Ashamed By His Appearance,
He Disguised His Deformities

And Became Obsessed
With Proving To The World

What Peanuts Were Capable Of.

He Began His Own
Evil Experiments

And Forced My Peaceful Genomes
To Work For Him.

All Except For Wally Here.

But Recently, He's Been
Working On Something Big...

And Possibly Very, Very Bad.


That's Why He Wanted
My Special Kicking Donkey
Dipping Sauce.

But Don't Sweat.
Those Clones Will Never
Find Out Where I Hid It.

Where Did You
Hide It, Oscar?

Somewhere Very Special.

Inside Penny's
Birthday Necklace.

Now, Where Did You
Put It, Sweetie?

I...Uh...

Am Unauthorized To
Answer Your Question.

What?

I Think What She's
Trying To Say

Is She Didn't Open
Your Gift, Oscar.

It's Still Sitting
In The Box In Penny's
Bedroom Back At Home.

I Have A Boat That Can
Get Us Off This Island.

We Must Hurry.
He Must Be Stopped
Before It's Too Late.

Going Somewhere?
[Evil Laugh]

We Know
All About You,
Dr. Peanut Brittle.

How Did You Find Us?


Penny Told Me.

Penny?

Penny, No!
What Are You
Doing?

I Can't Believe It.

My Own Daughter Sold Us Out.
Penny, Why?

I Thought--

[Evil Laugh]

Take Them Away.


Leave Me Alone!
Get Your Hands Off Me!


Morning, Suga Mama.

[Glass Breaking,
Clattering]

Hey! Mama!
Mom, What Are You Doing?

Yo, Stop Tripping, Son.

I'm Trying To Peep Out
The Secret Formula.

Ok, Try 2 Eggs
Plus Flour And Milk.

That's The Secret
Formula For Pancakes.

We Got Any?
'Cause I'm Starving.

Ho Ho. Oh, Snaps,
You Talking About Food.

Yo, Your Boy O-P-Z's
Taking Care Of That.

O-P-Z?

Daughter. The Hot Dogs
Are Almost Complete.

O-P-Z?

Uh, I'll Just
Have Some Juice.

On Second Thought,

I'll Pass On Breakfast
This Morning.

Too Long.

Too Short.

Ooh, Too Cute!

[Horn Honks]

Hey, 15!
I'll Be Right Down.

I'll See You Guys
After Rehearsal.

Oh, And, Daddy,
I Never Did Say Thanks
For My Birthday Necklace.

I Love It.

You're The Bomb.

I'm The Bomb?


Father, Do You Read Me?

I Have Important News
Regarding The Mission.

Daughter? I Thought
You Were On Your Way
To The Rehearsal.

I'm Still On The Island.

The Real Penny Proud
Is With You.

And She Has
The Secret Formula.

It's In Her Necklace.

You Must Retrieve It
And Return To Lagoon
Immediately.

Time Is Running Out.

Do Not Fail The Mission.

I Will Not Fail
The Mission.

[Overlapping Chatter]

Listen Up.
All Dancers To The Stage.

Break A Leg.
Or Olay Will Break One
For You.

Ok, People. Here's The Scenario
For The Halftime Show.

It's A Love Story.

15 Cent Is Trying To Meet
The Girl Of His Dreams.

But She's Keeping Him On Ice,
A'ight?

You Ready
For The Big Time,
Ponytails?

You Just Try To
Keep Up.

Shh, Shh, Shh!

Quiet, Everybody!
Here We Go.

Cue Music And...

â™ª Blowin' Up, Blowin' Up,
Blowin' Up, Blowin' Up â™ª


Move It!

â™ª Y'all Know Who I Am... â™ª

Hee Hee.
A Butterfly.

Hee Hee. A Butterfly.

Carefully, Zoey.
You're Blocking My View!

Ok, Penny,
Get Ready To Move In.

â™ª Hey â™ª

Let Me Feel It Now!

More Energy!


Wait A Minute.
Cut, Cut,<I> Cut!

Who<I> Is This Guy?

[All Gasp]

Daddy?

Uh...Ahem...

Hello, Daughter.

I'm So Sorry.

My Dad Was Just
Checking In On Me.

You Can Dismiss Him
Now.

Let's Go,
Mr. Proud.

Dismiss Him?
I Haven't Seen Anyone
Move Like That

Since That Old Woman
On<I> Soul Train.

Come On, Pops.
Do That Thing Again.

Show Me What
You're Workin' With!

You Mean...This?

[Music Starts]

I'm Feelin' This!

I'm Feeling This, Too!

Dang! Mr. Proud
Is Workin' It!

Kids: Go, Oscar.
Go, Oscar. Go, Oscar.

Go, Oscar, Go Oscar,
Go, Oscar.

[Video Game Tune]

Mama...

Whassup?

This New Cool
Version Of Daddy

Is Even Worse
Than The Original!

Word!

In Fact, I Wish
This Whole Family

Started Acting
Normal Again.

I'm Exhausted From
Staying Up All Night

'Cause Nobody's
Given Me A Curfew.

That's For Sure!

The House Is A Mess
Because No One's
Making Me Do Any Chores!

Bebe And Cece Stink!

And If I Ever Have To
Even Look At Another
Hot Dog Again,

I'm Gonna Be Sick!

Go!


Ohh!

Ah! Ha Ha! Oh!
Ha Ha!

Hey, P.C.!

How Was The Rehizzle
For Re-Izzle?

Great! I Was A Big Hit
With The Kids.

And--Oh, They Even
Named A Dance After Me.

â™ª Do The Oscar,
Do The Oscar â™ª

â™ª Do The Oscar,
It's The Oscar â™ª

â™ª It's My Birthday-- â™ª
They Kept Saying That.



How Do?

Cashew? What Are You
Doing Here?

Oh...Just Checkin' Out
Your Wardrobe.

You Know, You Could
Use A Little More
Variety.

Ok. I Stowed Away
On The Boat
And Followed You Here

Because I Wanted To See
What It Was Like To Have
A Real Family.

Only Problem Is,
You Don't Have
A Real Family Either.

Whatcha Talkin' About,
Cashew?

Your Real Family's
Still Back On The Island
Being Held Captive.

Those People Downstairs
Are Peanut Clones

Sent Here By The Evil
Dr. Marcus Garvey
Carver...Ii

To Find Your Father's
Secret Formula

So They Can
Take Over The World.

Hey! Is This Cashmere?

Cashew--Focus!

Are You Telling Me
My Family Is A Forgery?

Ah Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!

Oh, That's Funny!

That's Real Funny.

Come On,
Let's Go Downstairs

So I Can Let Everybody
Know You're Here.

[Penny Giggling]
You Guys Wouldn't Believe

Who Hitched A Ride
On The Boat.

Cashew! And He's Got
This Ridiculous Idea

That All Of You Guys
Are Clones!

Ah Ha Ha Ha Ha!

Hee...

That Is Ridiculous...
Ha Ha...Right?

Deep Voice: Yeah.
That Is Ridiculous.

Who Said That?!

I Did!

Now Gimme The Necklace

Or I'm Gonna Go
Upside Your Head

With This 10-Pound
Dirty Diaper.

See? I Told Ya.

Oh...I Get It.

This Is All A Dream.

Penny Ate A Bad
Hot Dog, And Now Penny's
Imagining Things.

Penny Needs To
Go Lie Down Now.

Get Her!

Aah!

Aah!

Aah! Bebe! Let Me Go!

I Got It!

Hoo Hoo Hah Hah!

Oh! Gimme Back
My Necklace,
You Fake Bebe!

Come On, Cece.
We Gotta Go!

Take Us Home!
Hoo Hoo Hah Hah Hah!

Mission Accomplished!

Good-Bye. See You, Baby.

We Got It!

Come On, Cashew.
I've Gotta Save
My Family.

And You're Gonna
Help Me.

Let's Do This.

Good News! Your Clones

Have Located
The Secret Formula.

They're Returning
To The Island At Any Minute...

Just In Time
To See Your Demise.

How Could You
Do This?

What About The Other
Night In The Hot Tub?

Didn't That Mean
Anything To You?

You And Carver?

We Was In The Hot Tub
Together. What You
Got To Do With It?

And He Gonna Be
Your Step-Daddy.
How You Like That?

That's Just
Straight-Up Nasty!

And Then I Said,
"That's Ridiculous, Right?"

And Then They Said,
"No More Games."

Then I Said,
"Penny's Dreaming!"

And Then They Said,
"Get Her!"

And Then They Took
My Necklace,

And Then They Got Into
A Helicopter And Took Off
For The Island!

Proud, That's The Whackiest
Story I've Ever Heard!

Hee Hee. People
Made From Peanuts?


How Do?

Aah!

Aah!

Aah!

So You Believe Me
Now?


Aw, He's Actually
Kinda Cute.

I Could Just Dip Ya
In Some Chocolate

And Eat You Right Up,
You So Cute!

Look, Y'all, I've Gotta
Get Back To That Island

And Save My Family!

Well, If You Goin',
We Goin', Too.

You Guys
Would Do That For Me?

We're Your Best
Friends, Penny.

That Means
We're Like Family!

So If<I> Your Family
Is In Trouble,

Then Doggone It,<I>
Our Family
Is In Trouble!

Can I Get An Amen?

Such A Dork.

Oh, Thanks, Guys!

Now, If We Only
Knew Someone

With A Really
Fast Boat...

Hold It! Nuh-Uh!
No Way!

I Am Not Doin'
That!

Ah! Don't Touch<I>
Anything!

If 15 Finds Out
I Stole His Yatch,

I'll Be Kicked Outta
His Entourage.

Sticky,
It's Pronounced Yacht.

Yetch, Yacht--
They Both Boats, Ok, Girl?

All Hands On Deck!

Operation Family
Liberation Is A Go.

Uh...You're Not Going
Anywhere, Proud.

Nubia, I Don't Have Time
To Trip With You
Right Now.

I Don't Care.
15 Cent Paid Us
To Guard His Boat.

So If You Want It...
You Gotta Match His Offer.

Cough Up The Cabbage.

Fine. You Want My Money,
Go Ahead And Take It.

It's In My Backpack.

How Do?

Aah!

Aah!

Aah!


Punch It, Proud!

Bye, Nubia!

It's On Now!

And Now The Time
Has Come

To Reveal My Crowning
Achievement--

My Masterpieces!

It Can't Be!
Are Those...

Genetically Engineered
Supergenomes.

Genetically Engineered
Supergenomes?

But I Abandoned
My Research

On The Agriculturally
Engineered Supersoliders
Years Ago.

I Could Never Get Them
To Stabilize.

Neither Could I.
But If My Hunch Is Correct,

Oscar Proud's Everlasting
Multiplying Formula

Will Certainly Change That.

Peanuts.

Hee Hee Hee Ha Ha Ha Ha.

They've Multiplied...

They've Stabilized...
Hee Hee Hee Hee Hee!

I'm An Evil Genius!

No One Will Ever Mock
The Accomplishments
Of A Peanut Again!

I Will Rule The World!

After I Sing My Song.

Song? What Song?

â™ª If I Ruled
The World â™ª

I Know This Fool
Ain't About To Sing.

â™ª I Would Make Sure
My Clones Don't Give
Any Slack â™ª

â™ª If I Ruled

But First...

I Think We Have To
Get Past Those
Leering Eyeballs

Hiding In The Bushes.

More Peanuts?

I'll Have You Know

That I Am Skilled
In The Ancient Art
Of Kar-Ate.

Hi-Yah!

Our People Aren't
Traditional Fighters.

There's Only One Way
To Get Past 'Em.

Create A Diversion

Oh, Sorry. Ha. Ahem.

I Overreacted.
Think You'll Forgive Me?

All Right. It's Cool.

Oh, That's Touching.

Kinda Freaky...
But That's Touching.

Trudy: Penny!

Penny!

Hey!

All: Huh?

When My Early Experiments
Went Bad,

I Used A Powerful Peanut
Liquification Gas

To Turn Them
Into Peanut Butter.

Cashew: It's Real
Potent Stuff.

One Small Dose
Can Destroy

The Entire Super-G
Army.

I Always Keep Some On Me
In Case Of Emergencies.

Aah!

Daddy, I Can't Believe

You Parasailed All The Way
Up There To Help Me.

You Must Really
Love Me After All.

Well, I Just Didn't
Want You To Hang Out

With All Those
Supergenomes.

They May Have Been
Peanuts, But They
Were Boy Peanuts.

[Both Chuckling]

My Whole Point
In That Thing

Didn't Exactly
Turn Out The Way
I Planned.

But...It Meant
A Lot To Me,

And I Wanted
To Keep It
In A Special Place.

And There's No Place
More Special...

Than With You.

Hey, My Necklace!

Happy Birthday, Penny.

Aw!

[Crowd Applauds]

Thanks For The Lift,

Girls: â™ª He-Ey â™ª

Well, You're 16
Now, Penny.

That Means
You're Officially

As Long As You Make

In More Appropriate
Attire.

What Do You Say, Guys?
