[Upbeat pop song]

TEACHER: And where does
the hydrogen come from?

Carbon dioxide, or the hydrogen dioxide?

It comes from the water. H2O.

It is an oxidation-reduction reaction,
and we breathe it in and reduce it...

oxidizing sugar and forming water.

Photosynthesis is what?

It is the reverse.

Respiration is energy releasing.

Alex...

are you dreaming what I was dreaming?

Winter break in Hawaii.

Hanging out with the cutest guys
in the world?

Dead on. This is gonna be awesome.

Our first chance at independence.

Away from the parents.

WOMAN: [Over P.A. system]
<i>Alex and Madison Stewart...</i>

<i>please report to the principal's office.</i>

[All exclaiming]

Okay, ladies, off you go.

Katherine!
Hey, guys.

We're going to the principal's office.
No, you're not. You're coming with me.

Is Dad okay?
Dad's fine.

He asked me to pick you up
from school early.

You've finished your finals, right?

Right.

And you've aced them?

Hopefully.
Then let's go.

'Bye.

Surprise!
Hi, Dad! How are you?

Come on, guys. We gotta go.

Hurry up. Buckle up.

Hey, buckle up because
we're next for takeoff, okay?

So, Dad, where are we going? Hawaii?

Are you sending us there
to hook up with our friends?

No, we're not going
to Hawaii today, girls. We're going...

somewhere much better.

I'm taking you to Atlantis.

Atlantis?

As in the Lost Continent?

No. The Atlantis Resort...

in the Bahamas.

The Bahamas?

But we really wanted to go
on a school trip to Hawaii.

We have no friends in the Bahamas.
There are no luaus in the Bahamas.

There are no lifeguards in the Bahamas.

We're just saying, what do
the Bahamas have that Hawaii doesn't?

Well...

me and your mother...

and I need the beach...

and I need a martini.

Stat! Okay.

You ready?

'Cause I gotta get in there
and make this thing fly.

You guys are gonna get hungry,
aren't you?

I wonder if I have anything for you.

Wait a minute.

Did Dad come through?
Thank you.

Did Dad come through? That's nice.

Okay, buckle up. Seriously. We gotta go.

How sweet.
Dad remembered our security blankets.

All glazed.

Hi.
Hi, Mom.

Welcome. I missed you.

I missed you.

We missed you, too.

Hello. Hello.

This place is just as beautiful as Hawaii.
I'm so excited.

How was your flight?
Smooth.

Did the Graysons arrive?

I don't know. We'll check at the hotel.
You have to see it. It's a blast.

Not bad.

We have a surprise for you.

You worked very hard at school.
We're very proud of you.

And so we thought it was time
you had your own suite.

Thank you!

Why don't you check the front desk
and see if the Graysons have made it yet.

Sure, Mom.

Excuse me.

Were you in line?

Brianna Wallace. Messages, please.

Certainly, Miss Wallace.
And how is your father today?

In the casino, wondering
why this is taking so long.

CLERK: I'm sorry.

Thank you.

And thank you.

Next time, take a number.

Welcome to Atlantis. How are you today?

Good. Have the Graysons checked in yet?

CHAD: We're here!
HARRISON: Come on.

Hey, everybody.

Hey.

Good to see you.

Lovely. Lovely.

Hey, Griffen. Hey, Keegan.

Hi, Madison.

And...

And Alex.

Hi.

Hi.

Listen, Harr. I've been thinking
about the Frankfort acquisition.

I'd like to run some numbers by you.
Over drinks, of course.

Chad. As your CEO and your friend...

I direct you to stop all business
for five days.

It's really difficult.
I understand.

What's that sound?

That's the sound of the beach
calling our name.

Go ahead. We'll see you later.

Don't forget to put on sun block.

Dad, I'm heading to the pool.

Go.

Me, too.

Bye-bye.
Watch her.

These family vacations are great...

but we're old enough to be on our
own now. I mean, we're turning 18.

What?

In three years.

He's a good one.

Computer-gaming magnate waiting
for technology to catch up with him.

Please don't tell me you're up
for hanging out with Chad and Jill...

and their bratty daughter Keegan,
and their nerdy son Griffen?

I don't know if you've noticed,
but Griffen isn't so nerdy anymore.

Shut up!

This one's ready for marriage.

How do you know?

Pierced ear.

He knows pain and he's bought jewelry.

[Rock music]

"I feel the need.

"The need for speed."

Look.

HARRISON: Oh, my God.

JILL: They look like
they're having so much fun.

Look how much fun they are having.

To family.
Yeah.

To family.
To family.

[Soft instrumental music]

Hot enough for you?

Smokin'.

Hey, runt, don't sneak up on me like that.

I wasn't watching Madison. I was...

scanning the horizon for ships.

Yeah. That's why
your deeply repressed feelings...

are written all over your face.

What do you know?
Everything, I have a stunning IQ.

You know, I've made a decision.

I'm going to enjoy all aspects
of this vacation.

I'm officially letting go
of this whole Hawaiian vaca-thing...

with our friends.

It's gone.

Maybe not gone gone,
but I'm trying hard to work through it.

Strong move. Very empowering.

Do you see?
I'm all over that.

Impressive.

Hey, girls. Do you party?

Sure.

Very impressive.

Thank you. Now it says here...

the Caribbean has long been
a stronghold for smugglers and pirates.

Mom, please, we have nothing they want.

Keegan, did you make
that beautiful necklace?

It's nothing. Just a typical string
of mollusk-less cohabitations.

Exactly.

Okay.

Puka shells.

Right.

JILL: Griffen will be in college next year.

Any idea what you want to study?

I've always been interested in
flying insects, like bees, wasps, hornets...

So you're gonna study entomology?

No. I was actually thinking
aeronautical engineering.

A good choice.

Wow! Would you look at the time.
May we be excused?

This guy Scott invited us to a party.

A party? Well, I don't know.

Where is it?

Right here at the hotel.

Okay. But I want you back by 11:00, okay?

Okay.

Dad, is it cool if I go, too?

Yeah. Sure. Just remember
you've got a curfew, too, buddy.

Okay.

Well, I guess they're on their way
to not needing us.

The onset of adolescence among offspring
is frequently difficult to accept.

Perhaps my mom can help you
work through some issues.

She's a professional.

My card.

[Singing Us Against The World by Play]

I'll get the drinks.

Pineapple smoothies for us
will be just fine. Thanks.

Hottie at 10:00.

He's smiling at you.

I'm not blind. I saw that.

Now he knows I saw that.

Hey. I'm gonna dance.

Good for you.

So, do you want to join me?

Sure.

What's your name?
Alex.

That's it, just one name?

It's one more than you.

Jordan. Are you here
on vacation with the fam?

Yeah. You?

Oh, I live here. I take care
of the marine habitats at the Atlantis.

It's enormous. Some people say
it's the largest in the world.

It's amazing.

We're staying here.

Oh, cool.
Yeah.

I'm so tired of these lavish winter parties.

Hanging out at the beach
getting tans, pedicures...

enjoying the good grace
of my excellent father.

Really?
Are you kidding?

I live for it.
For real.

So, Brianna, it just wouldn't be
winter vaca...

if you didn't hook up with the cutest boy
on the beach. So who's it gonna be?

Let's start our screening process,
shall we?

Hi.
'Bye.

Hey. What's up?

Not my temperature.

Say?
Nothing. And, keep moving.

Ladies, we have a winner.

Looks like you're not the only one
who thinks so.

Now, he's what time it is.

I'll bet money on Brianna any day.

Excuse me. My name is Brianna Wallace...

as in the Wallace Department Store
Wallaces.

What's your name?

Jordan Landers, as in
the Landers Hardware Store Landers.

A sense of humor. Cute.

Sorry. I don't believe I know you.

Yeah. We met in the lobby.

"Take a number"?

No. I'm sorry.
I don't ever remember seeing you.

I guess you get that a lot.

Can you excuse me, ladies?

Now that we've met, I just want to get
a few things straight around here.

I get what I want.
And this winter break, I want Jordan.

Brianna Wallace, let the games begin.

This can't be good.

It's Dad. He wants us to call him
the instant we come in.

[Knocking on door]

Too late. He's here.

It is 12:15 a.m.

How late does that make them?

Precisely 75 minutes past curfew.

If we were back home,
we'd be 45 minutes early.

Nice try.

We voted on it. And it was unanimous.

We decided it was okay
if we were a little late...

because we are
in the Bahamas on vacation.

You took a vote?

Well, it was your loss.
We had a great time tonight.

It would have been nice
to share it with you as a family.

I recommend that
for the rest of this holiday...

you respect your curfews, okay?

Now, get to bed because we have
a full day planned for tomorrow.

But I have a day date.

A day date?

Yeah. A date during the day.

I've accepted an invitation to go
horseback riding on the beach with Scott.

Who's Scott?

A nice guy that I met on the beach.

And I was gonna concentrate
on chilling by the pool.

I like the sound of that.

Why don't we all concentrate
on chilling by the pool together.

But what about my day date?

We'll see.

Go to bed.


How great was that?

I made it.
That was great.

I haven't had this much fun since...

last year with the family.

Yeah, okay.

Who's up for another run? Let's go.

All right. Go ahead.

Go have fun without us.

I'll read a book or...

Let's go again.

No!

Hi. Nice shell. Want some help?

I think I got it covered.

My name's Jeffrey.

I'm kind of busy, Jeffrey.

You want to play Frisbee?

A plastic, spinning dog toy? No thanks.

You want to check out my warts?

Tempting, but no.

You want to build a sandcastle?

I got a better idea.

I'm never going to get out of here.

Precisely.

Help!

Hi, Jordan.

Hey, Alex. This is my friend Champlaine.

He runs the Sea-Doo Shack.
Nice to meet you.

Very nice to meet you.

And you will get that package to me
that we talked about?

You bet.

I'm making my rounds.
You want to give me a hand?

Yeah, sure.
Cool.

So what kind of fish are these?

These are actually spotted eagle rays.

And they're cousins to the stingray
and the manta ray.

Dangerous?

No. I mean, they're harmless.

Unless they feel threatened.

See, they're hungry.
You know, they eat four, five times a day.

They dig in the sand for crabs, right?

Yeah, they do. You know about fish?

I love sushi.

You do? Do you want to feed them?
'Cause they'll eat right out of your hand.

I don't know. You do it first.

Okay.

Oh, my God.

Just like that.

They don't have teeth or anything, right?
No teeth.

They just suck on you?

It's okay, just feed them.
Yeah.

Good job.
It's sucking on me.

It's okay.

Jordan, you're wanted at the mine pool.

Can't you get Roger to cover it?
I'm a little busy.

She specifically asked for you.

Who?

Miss Wallace's father
is a very, very important client of ours.

He spends a lot of money here.
So, please, don't keep her waiting.

So I guess I'll see you later?

Hopefully sooner.

Look. I do this to the cards and
one card jumps to the top.

Your card is the Ace of Clubs.
Nope.

CHAD: What was it?
JILL: King of Hearts.

Man, I do that and look what happens.
It becomes the King of Hearts.

[Rap music playing on stereo]

You know what I think of this music?

You don't understand what the big deal is?

I like it.
Really?

Yes.

I find it kind of angry.
Are you angry, Harrison?

No, I'm open-minded.

All right. But if you start listening...

to rap music in the car, I'm taking the bus.

Oh, really?
I'm kidding!

You know, maybe I'll start rapping myself.


Brianna, I really should get back to work.

Is it important?

It's my job.

Look, as long as you're with me,
you won't get into trouble.

Jordan.

Excuse me, Miss Wallace.

Jordan, I need your help right away.

There's been a P.I. over at the shark pool.

P.I.?

Puking incident.
Some kid puked all in the shark pool.

Anyway, I need you to clean it up
for me right away. ASAP.

Trolling for barf?

How did you know?

I made the call.

Then there isn't any?

Isn't it about break time?

I guess so.

Can I help? Yeah?

[Sinister instrumental music]

[Soft instrumental music]

You ride well.

Thanks. Summer camp.

Why are we stopping?

I think my horse has sand in his shoe.
That's funny. Let's go.

I'll race you back to the barn.
I was serious.

Did you know that a lot of scholars
think that Atlantis, the Lost Continent...

was originally right here in the Caribbean?

Others think it was in the Mediterranean.

That's nice, but do you mind if we talk...

about something a little more personal?

Sure. I don't mind.

Great.

What I'm gonna say
might seem a little forward...

but we've known each other
for a long time...

so I feel comfortable
expressing myself to you.

Express away.

Okay. Well, I really like this guy,
and I think he likes me, too, but...

you know, I think he's shy
and afraid to tell me.

Maybe this guy needs you
to make the first move.

Well, that's why I'm talking to you.

It's Scott.

Right. I mean, who else could it be.

Right. And he's so sweet and nice.
I just think he needs a little encouraging.

So I guess you want my help.

Thanks.

GRIFFEN: Hey, Scott.

What's up, dude?

Look, I wanted to talk to you
about Madison.

Are you going with her, man?
No, give me a break.

Good. Because I'm into her, dude.

But I have a real hard time
talking to her, you know?

I think she thinks I'm an idiot.

No, I doubt it.

No, it's like when I'm with her I freeze,
you know?

It's not like "We're getting cold"
type of freeze. It's like...

I think I know what you mean.
Here, go with me on this, okay?

Okay. Let me tell you
a little something about our girl.

Sweet.

She loves astronomy. And when she was...

growing up she loved Judy Blume books.

Have you ever read
any Judy Blume books?

Have you ever read any books?

Does <i>Sports Illustrated</i> count?

Okay, that's a magazine.
Oh, right.

So try to remember these titles.
Okay.

<i>- Blubber.
Blubber.</i>

<i>Forever.</i>

<i>Forever.</i>

She loves that book.

If she loves it, I love it.

Good. So, I've given you
a number of topics to discuss with her...

guaranteed to break the ice.
Are you ready?

I got it all here in a nutshell.

Right. All right. See you later, man.

<i>Blubber. Forever.</i>

[Reggae music playing on radio]

Thanks, Ziggy, man.
Another beer?

Yeah. Heavy on the root.

Hey, Keegan. What's up?

This kid doesn't know when to quit.

Hey, Jeffrey. I was thinking
of going digging for sea gophers.

I can do that. What's a sea gopher?

I still haven't found anything.
Keep digging.

I had a great time
horseback riding today, did you?

Are you okay?

So, when are we gonna start talking
about books?

What? Oh, well,
we can talk about books anytime.

I love books.

So, tell me, Madison, do you like to read?

Well, yeah. That's usually what I do
with books, read them.

I love Judy Blume.

Oh, really? Oh, she's my favorite.
What have you read by her?

<i>Flubber.</i>

<i>"Flubber."</i>

Was that wrong?

Yeah, but only by one letter.

The title is <i>Blubber.</i>

It's a great book.
You read <i>Sports Illustrated?</i>

Hi. What are you up to?

Working.
Can I help?

Sure.

This is where it all happens.

This is where I come every day.
This is what I do.

Here, put on these gloves.
No.

Come on, just put them on.
You're gonna help me out.

Is this a test of my affection?

No. You haven't seen anything yet.

You want to try?

Smoothie.

See, the consistency isn't that bad.

I figure after all that fish guts you'd like
to do something a little more fun.

So, you're not only the chef,
but you're the waiter.

Something like that.

Just think, you could've been forced
to listen to Brianna...

tell you about
her Parisian shopping spree...

as you rub her down
with imported tanning oil.

Hey, that doesn't sound half bad.

Hey.
I'm kidding. Come on.

So, how did it go with Madison?
I think it went really great.

Except, I found out something about me
I really didn't know.

Yeah, what's that?
My memory sucks.

So, what do you have planned after lunch?

First, we'll probably hit the beach.
And then we'll check out another beach.

Then, we'll have smoothies.
We can't forget smoothies.

Light and nourishing.

Good plan. What about after smoothies?

Well, we'll probably hit the beach.

What about you?

I'm going with Keegan.
We're hunting sea gophers.

Sounds fun. I'm going into town.
You girls want to come?

Town?
What's in town?

Shopping.

"Shopping." What a beautiful word.

Mom, you're inspired.

That's not fair.

But, you can come with us if you want.

We know how you love shopping
with us. You can hold our bags.

You can stand and watch us
try things on for hours...

On second thought, I'll stay here.
Wouldn't that be redundant...

Maybe I'll dive into the shark tank
to avoid shopping. How's that?

[Church bells chime]

What do you think of this? It's cute, right?
For Dad, yeah.

What about this? Scary, right?
Is that real?

No. It's illegal to sell the real stuff.

They're considered national treasures.
All the native artifacts here are replicas.

JUDY: So, what did you get?

[Children chattering]

I've been crunching some numbers here.

And I think if we acquire that
German manufacturing company...

we're gonna...

Are we talking business?
It just slipped out.

You know what your problem is?
You don't know how to have fun.

Follow me.

[Rock instrumental music]

CHAD: I won!

So, how is the vacation going?

I'm having the best time with Jordan.
He's so cute.

I mean, first I got a hickey from a stingray.

And then I got to gut a fish.

Fish gutting. That does sound like fun.

I'm having an awful time with Scott.
I mean, I feel like we have a connection.

It's just, he gets so tongue-tied.

You know what your problem is? You
want to have your cake and eat it, too.

Alex, you know that makes no sense.

I mean, I have some cake, and then I eat it.

You're trying to tell me I can't do that?
It's just a saying.

Everyone knows you can't
have your cake and eat it, too.

Sure you can.

Okay. Why are you saying you can?
You can't. Everyone knows you can't.

I'm saying I can,
because everybody gets it wrong.

What you mean to say is,
"You can't eat your cake and have it, too."

Now that, you can't have.

I never thought of it like that. Good point.

"You can't eat your cake and
have it, too." Except...

What do you mean "except"?
There is no "except."

Okay. Just hear me out for a sec, okay?

If I eat my cake, it's in my stomach, right?

Unless it's on your blouse. Yes.

And if it's in my stomach,
isn't that the same as having it?

In a manner of speaking.

[Ominous instrumental music]

I want to talk to you more about this later.
But, right now...

What's Jordan doing here?

I don't know.
Why don't you ask him when you see him?

Why don't I ask him now?
Everything all right?

Yeah, Mom, everything's fine.

All right then, drink up.
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

So, what's the rush?
I got something important to talk about.

Important is good.
Yeah. Okay. Sit right here.

So, what's up?

"The soul selects her own society

"Then shuts the door

"On her divine majority

"Obtrude no more"

Emily Dickinson. She's my favorite.

Mine, too.

So, do you like astronomy?

[Pounding tropical music]

I love astronomy.
Me, too.

So, what's your sign?

That's astrology.

Yeah.

I have to go to the bathroom.

Right.

You going to sleep?

No, just thinking.
I don't know what to do about Scott.

I mean, I like him a lot,
but every time we're together...

it's just so awkward.

Well, why don't you come
with Jordan and me.

Why? What's up?
Everything.

You know what? Why don't you go
catch the elevator and I'll be right there.

Hey.
Busy right now?

No.

Okay, good. We're gonna go
get a little wet and wild.

[All screaming excitedly]

Yes, Security, this is Brianna Wallace...

calling from Room 107
in the Royal Towers.

I'm trying to get some sleep...

and there's some deafening noise
coming from the pool area.

Be a love and do something about it,
would you? Thank you.

Okay, everybody, get out of the pool now!
Out! Out of the pool.

Dude.
What?

Out! Get out!
I work here, man...

Out! Get out of the pool.

Hey, call Miss Wallace and tell her we
found the source of the excessive noise.

Who?
Brianna.

Okay. 'Bye.

[Somber instrumental music]

Jordan Landers, you can go.

I can?

Miss Wallace doesn't want
to press any charges.

What about my friends?

Man, she didn't say anything about them.
Then I'm staying, too.

Out.
Jordan, just go.

Terry, old buddy.

What do you say? Can you hook us up
and look the other way?

Sure.
Very nice.

I take that back.

But, Dad, we can explain.
No. No, you can't.

Good night, girls.

That's weird.

We didn't get the usual 8:30 a.m.
wakeup call from Mom and Dad.

[Knocking on door]

Hey. Personal wakeup call.

Hey.
Hi.

I guess you didn't see this.
I got the same one.

"Went to have fun. Love, Mom and Dad."
Where are they?

I don't know. They're not in their room.
What's the deal?

Mom and Dad ditched us.

Excuse me, but are parents supposed
to be having this much fun?

[All whooping]

They've completely lost it.

Come on.

Hey!
Hey. How're you guys doing?

Good, I guess.

We didn't hear from you guys
this morning.

We wanted to get an early start.
Snorkeling in 10 minutes.

Got to go.

Can you girls get lunch on your own?
You, too. Right, Griffen?

Sure.
Yeah.

Are they trying to get back at us?

Our parents ditched us.

Hey, Griffen, wait up.

What's up, man, you got a hot date
and need my coaching skills?

Not yet. But I got a volleyball game
and Madison wants me...

to meet Flipper, and I hate fish.
Will you cover for me?

No problem.
Sweet.

All I ask is,
I got my three friends over there.

All I want is just four Sea-Doos
and that's cool.

All right, $40 for all of us.
How did you pull that off?

I told you, I got connections.

Which is why I have to ask you.

What were you doing in town yesterday?

You were there?

We were shopping and
we saw you, talking to him.

Oh, Champlaine?

I was just delivering him a package,
doing him a favor.

Now he's doing us a solid back.

Okay. Let's go.

[Singing Can't Get You Out Of My Head
by Empty Trash]

Best kiwi smoothies in the tropics.
This place is off the hook.

This place is off the hook.

Hey, Alex, you want to dance?
Sure.

Hey, Jordan. Do you want to dance?

Yeah, with Alex.

Oh, my God. Our parents are here.

It's okay.
Okay.

Just, they're like the sun. Just don't look
directly at them and we'll be okay.

So, playing the ignoring card
is very strong.

We're ignoring.
And we're ignoring some more.

And we're taking a sip of our drink.
I do not acknowledge their presence.

Anybody else feel out of place?
What'd you say, sonny?

Stay right here.
Okay.

Honey, I've had enough crowds,
enough kids and not enough of you.

Can we please go?

Oh, absolutely.

Hey.
Hi.

You want to dance?
Sure.

Has anyone seen Jordan?
I was just dancing with him.

At least I thought
I was just dancing with him.

<i>I'd like to dedicate this song to Alex.</i>

[Singing Shades In The Sun
by Empty Trash]

So, how did you get away from your folks?

I didn't. I'm in my room watching the WB.

Has anyone ever told you
that you're incredible?

Not today.

Has anyone ever told you that...

I am going to kiss you?

SCOTT: Thanks for covering for me
with Madison and the dolphins.

No problem, man.

She wants to meet me
at the cove in an hour.

Oh, no, not again. No more plans.
No, dude. But this is foolproof.

See? You're not the only one
with good ideas around here. Walkies.

Okay, but you have to do
exactly as I tell you.

Totally. Yeah.

[Light jazzy instrumental music playing]

All right.

Thank you.

Don't let her sit there.
No.

What's wrong?

Tell her:

<i>"I wanted you to have
a better view of the aquarium."</i>

I wanted you to have the
better view of the aquarium.

You're so sweet.

I know.

<i>Okay. Tell her,
"I read a really great book the other day."</i>

So, I read a really great book
the other day.

Really? What's it called?

The jerk chicken.

<i>The Jerk Chicken.</i>

MADISON: <i>Never heard of that.</i>

What's it about?

It's a mystery.

It's a series, actually. <i>The Jerk Chicken...</i>

<i>The Fried Sparrow,</i> you know,
<i>The Cooked Goose.</i>

You're kidding, right?

<i>I mean, a mystery series about...</i>

different ways to cook a bird?

Are you feeling okay?
Yeah.

<i>Okay. Scott, relax. We're cool.</i>

Tell her, "I couldn't sleep...

"as the mere thought of spending
the day with you made me...

<i>"twitch in anticipation."</i>

I didn't sleep. I mean, the mere thought
of spending the day with you...

made me itch in anticipation.

Not "itch," you idiot!
Not "itch," you idiot!

What?
"Twitch."

"Twitch."

You are so out of it.

Thanks.
Thanks.

You know what, Scott, I don't know...

what your problem is, but I think,
it's time for me to go to the bathroom.

Scott told me everything.

I don't know what you're talking about.

I'm straight up with you,
you be straight up with me.

Okay?
Okay, you got me.

You are amazing, but this is my bad.

I asked you to encourage him.
I didn't expect you to be him.

I guess I got a little carried away.

But, all I wanted to do
was make you happy.

You did.
I did?

How do you know so much about me?

I guess we have known each other
for a long time.

True. But that goes both ways, and...

I don't know that much about you.

Everybody's got a hobby, right?

You're mine.

Judy Blume?

Let's just say I've had a crush on you
a long time.

Did you know Antares is in the
southern sky all night this summer?

Really? That's fantastic.

It's the second largest red giant
in the galaxy.

Second largest? No.
I'm pretty sure it's the largest.

I think you're right.

Running up Dad's room service tab alone
just doesn't quite carry the same allure.

I miss Mom and Dad telling us what to do.

We deserve this. I mean,
we brushed them off this whole trip.

And now look at us.
We're going out and they don't even care.

We made our bed and
now we have to sleep in it.

We made our bed and
now we have to sleep in it.

Aha!

If we made our bed,
why do we want to sleep in it?

Do you make your bed
and then want to sleep in it?

No.
Exactly.

When I make my bed, I'm up for the day.
What about you?

I'm ready for breakfast.
I'm ready to go shopping, to the beach...

I'm ready to do anything but sleep
in that just-made bed.

Okay, you have a point.

Let's say, I make my bed and go out,
do a little shopping...

but in the middle of the day,
I want to take a little nap.

So I come home. Can I sleep in it?

Yes.

But would you fold it down
before you went to sleep?

I wouldn't sleep on top of it.

Then technically,
the bed would be unmade.

All right.

Okay. Fine. You win.
Yes!

You're amazing. I can't wait to see how
the island looks from offshore at night.

It's our first moonlight cruise.
But first, we got to make one little stop.

Champlaine wants me
to pick something up for him.

Okay.

Wow! This is amazing.

Very nice.
Have you ever seen such a...

Never.

Anybody notice anything weird
about this boat?

You know what it's missing?
A party?

No. People.

You're right. It's deserted.

Why don't you guys hang out here
for a little bit and I'll be right back, okay?

Let's explore.

I wonder what this is for.

[Loud rock music plays]

Hey!

Sorry.

I wonder who owns this tub?
Some rich guy.

I thought you were here to pick up
something, not go fishing.

This is it. He's probably stuck in the casino
and needs his rig in the morning. Let's go.

Okay.

JORDAN: Hey, you guys,
there's this really cool little island...

It's a little private island
I want to take you guys to.

This is my favorite time of the evening.

It's gorgeous out here.

Watch your step.
Be careful.

I'm sorry.

MADISON: You okay? You need help?
ALEX: Are you okay?

That was great.
That was cool.

That was so much fun.

Before we do anything else,
I just have to drop this off for Champlaine.

Okay.

You will all stand perfectly still.

What?
What?

Wait a minute! This doesn't belong to you.
What are you doing?

Quite correct.
It belongs to the people of the Bahamas.

What?
And you're all under arrest.

What?
Jordan?

For smuggling antiquities.
For what?

Antiquities?

These are national treasures
that must not leave this country.

Take them away. Let's go.
Wait a second.

We didn't do anything.
All of you.

GRIFFEN: Come on! What is this?
JORDAN: I want my stuff back, man.

[Phone ringing]

We're sitting here in jail
and it's all your fault.

I swear I didn't know what was going on.
You set us up.

Lay off. If he says he didn't know,
he didn't know.

Alex, do you realize where we are?
This isn't detention. It's jail.

In a foreign country.

It's not American Express,
it's <i>Midnight Express.</i>

And you're expecting us to believe him?

Yeah.

[Grave instrumental music]

Excuse me.

Thank you for your understanding, Officer.

We're satisfied the children
had no prior knowledge of the crime.

But you should learn
to choose your companions better.

We do and that's why
we know Jordan isn't guilty.

At least we hope so.

Well, good day.

We need to have a meeting.

You better believe it.

But don't you see, they're blaming Jordan
and it wasn't his fault.

Alex, honey, he was caught red-handed.

He didn't know what was in the box.

We told the police we went to this
humungous yacht in the bay.

They didn't want to listen.

Why aren't they looking there instead
of blaming this whole thing on Jordan?

Okay. Where was this yacht?

But it was right here last night.
We were on it.

Champlaine, the white-haired guy.
Right!

We know who will clear up all of this.
Jordan did a favor for him last night.

He owns the Sea-Doo Shack on the beach.

All right.

Where to?

ALEX: The shack was right here.

Champlaine must be behind this.
He's the one who should be in jail.

We trust you. You're good girls.
We let you run around on your own.

But we just bailed you out of jail and...

that's not a typical vacation activity.

So, for the duration
you're gonna be sticking with us.

But, Dad, can we...
No, there's no discussion.

So, let's order our lunches
and just have fun together.

GRIFFEN: I can't believe it.
We just got turned into leash babies.

How are we gonna clear Jordan
if we're stuck with our parents?

So you believe that Jordan didn't do it?

The graffiti is on the wall.
This is a major cover-up.

We have to find Champlaine
and that yacht.

What about the folks?
They'll be watching everything we do.

If we always know
where our parents are...

we'll never miss an opportunity to escape.
Let's do it!

You got transpo all set?

Right out front.

Okay, there can't be any slip-ups.

It's not rocket science, bro.

All right, you know what to do.

[Voices laughing and talking
over tape recorder]

GRIFFEN: [On tape] <i>Quit it! Hey, Alex, stop!</i>

[Rhythmic Latino drumbeat]

What's wrong?

I think it might be time to go home.

Well, you can't just get over
something that upsets you.

You have to work through it.
Jill?

Do me a favor and take off your lab coat.

I need a mother right now, not a shrink.

Sure.

It's about the girls.

It's just they're 15,
and after last night my head says:

"Pull in the reins." You know?

But then I look at them,
they're growing up so fast.

My heart says, "Let them go."

I know I need to be
in the middle somewhere...

I just...

I don't know exactly where that is.

You've been there.

Griffen is 16.
I know you've thought about this.

Only every day of my life.

Good. Then I'm not crazy.

Well, if you are, then we all are.

Well, they seem to be doing good now.
Yeah.

MADISON: [On tape] <i>Griffen, stop!</i>

<i>Don't splash!</i>

[Tense instrumental music]

He's not here. Let's go.

Have you seen this white-haired guy?

He runs the Wave Runners Shack.

I saw a guy at the straw market.

Thank you.
Thanks.

There he is.

There he is.
Let's go after him. Come on!

Let's go. I think he went to the right.

Come on, he's over there!

There he is!
I see him.

Upstairs!
Come on.

Where is he?

Over there, to the right.

Get after him. Let's go!

Come on!
Where'd he go?

GRIFFEN: Come on! There he is!

ALEX: Where'd he go?

All right, let's go. I see him.
Oh, there he is.

He's down there. Faster!

We're gonna lose him.
This way. Come on!

Over here!
He went inside.

GRIFFEN: No, this way! Come on!
ALEX: There he is! I see him!

Yes?

Oh. Sorry. Let's go!

There he goes.

Run faster!
This way. Over here!

There he is! Come on!
Let's go!

Come on guys! I see him.

GRIFFEN: Get out of our way!

MADISON: Watch out!

Let's go!

Where'd he go?

There he is!
Faster!

Catch him!

He went to the left.

We lost him!

Let's go.

GRIFFEN: [On tape] <i>Come on.</i>

Come on, you guys. Yeah.

Don't splash!

Mom. Dad. Is it time for lunch?
Good idea.

Why don't you kids dry off
and we'll meet in the restaurant in, say...

five minutes?
Okay.

And, girls, that's five minutes, okay?

All right, Dad.
Hear you, Dad. Okay.

You know, lay down the rules.
They'll be there. Relax.

The guy on the boat is filthy rich.
He can't be doing it for the money.

So he must be a collector.

So, if there's one antiquity,
there'll be more.

And that's all we need
to get Jordan out of the slammer.

We've gotta find the boat.

I'm gonna have some conch salad.

I know I've had it two days in a row.
I love it.

They, like, jump off the side,
get conch, and bring it right up fresh.

Yum!

Where's Keegan?

There's a <i>Teletubbies</i> marathon
on channel six.

<i>Teletubbies?</i> Isn't that a bit juvenile?

She says it reminds her of her youth.

[Alex groans]

Are you okay?

I think I swallowed too much water.
I don't feel so well.

Do you want to go to the ladies' room?
Do you mind?

We'll be right back.

Why don't you go to the gift shop
and see...

if they have any Pepto-Bismol.

Sure. Good idea.

That's really sweet, don't you think?
They're working together as a team.

I'm just glad to see they've all
become such good friends.

Come on, guys, we have to go.

Wow. What was that for?

Just in case I don't get another chance.

Come on.

Maybe we should check
with the harbor master.

No. He'll ask too many questions.

Let's keep looking.

Look, this one has a dark hull
like the other one.

No, it just looks the same.
See, it's got a different name.

The boat we boarded was
the <i>Saxson Explorer.</i> This is <i>Shalimar.</i>

It's got a different color flag.

I guess they must make
a bunch of these giant yachts.

No, I'm telling you, this is the yacht.
There's only one way to find out.

Check this out.

[Loud rock music plays]

I told you it was the same boat.

Let's go. She's right.

HARRISON: That was the best meal yet.

Great, right?
Thanks.

Hi. Sorry it took so long.

I was in the bathroom and it just...
Alex, spare us the gory details.

But you're feeling better, right?

Not really.
No?

Why don't you just go upstairs
and rest for a bit.

Maybe you got a little too much sun.
Okay, Dad.

I'm gonna go with her.
Okay.

All right, take care of your sister.
'Bye.

Do you believe them?

No.

No.

CHAD: No? Wait a minute.

After all that's happened,
you still trust them?

Yeah, I do.

What do you mean you can't go?

We just told you this is the same yacht
where we picked up the tackle box.

The yacht belongs to Mark Saxson,
a very powerful man in these waters.

We have search and seizure laws
in this country just like in yours.

Without hard evidence
we cannot board without a reason.

I'll give you a good reason.
It's filled with smuggled antiquities.

You saw these antiquities yourself?

Well, no, not exactly...

I'm sorry.
Without hard evidence my hands are tied.

The police won't board this ship
without a good reason.

So, we'll give them a good reason.

You have a plan?
The mother of all plans.

How's it going?

It's okay so far.

Did you guys see anything?
No.

Are we being followed yet?
I don't know. Do you guys see anything?

Check the rear. I think we've got company.

Let them catch us. They'll come aboard,
they'll find the evidence and...

What evidence?
Exactly. If they come aboard...

and we don't have any evidence
they'll bust us for borrowing this tub.

COP: [Over bullhorn] <i>Attention,</i>
Shalimar, <i>cut your engines immediately.</i>

<i>Attention,</i> Shalimar, <i>cut your engines
or we will be forced to take action.</i>

Okay, let's go. We'll be downstairs.
Hurry.

Hurry. I can't outrun them.

They're gaining on us!

Sorry, girls, the party's over.

<i>Attention,</i> Shalimar,
<i>cut your engines immediately.</i>

Oh, my God. He's stopped the boat.

You want evidence?

We got evidence.

You should be very proud.

Your daughters and their friends,
they're heroes.

Dad, we were wondering if next year...

What?

Well, I guess this won't be
the last family vacation.

Mary-Kate, there was a rewrite.

Can I have a script, please?
Here you go.

WENDY: Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
MARY-KATE: Sorry, everyone. Sorry.

Sorry, everyone.

Everybody settle, please.
Let's go, Mary-Kate. And, action!

We hope next year's trip is as
good as the last family vacation.

And that's a cut. Very nice.
Check the camera.

ASHLEY: Thanks, everyone.

Good job, guys.
Thank you.

[All chattering]

Hi, Megan.
Oh, hi.

It was great, wasn't it? You were good.
Thanks.

It was kind of a stretch for me.
No, you were good.

You did a great job.
Hi, Chris? It's Jamie.

You've been my agent for what,
10 or 11 years now?

And I've never complained once.

That's great. You live in the Valley?
Yeah.

We should go out some time.
My number's on the call sheet.

Okay.
It was great meeting you.

It was a lot of fun making this movie.
It was very cute.

It's pretty cool, actually.

But see, it's 100% Mary-Kate and Ashley.

Props, do you want
these glasses and rings?

I mean, let's face it. They, produced it,
starred in it, they cast it.

They hired the director and the writers.
Nice working with you, sweetie.

And who got all the close-ups? Not me.
Who got all the great wardrobe?

Not me. Who got all the juicy scenes?
Not me.

I got a paper. I got a watch. I got glasses.
The paper's from last Friday.

Who were asked for autographs
for hours a day...

while people just completely ignored me?
Not me!

'Bye, Chris.

'Bye.

Hey, where's Cliff?
He went straight to the airport.

He wanted to get back to his family.
Seven come 11. Here we go.

We only have a few minutes
to get to the airport.

Would you relax? I'm making money here.
Here we go. Come on now, guys.

Working with you guys is so much fun.

I really hope we get to shoot
another picture together.

Great.
Thank you.

We have to get rid of him.
Why? He was so nice.

I know, but the director
was furious with him.

He missed at least a dozen shots.

Big question now is,
where are we gonna shoot our next film?

The map.

London, Paris, Sydney, the Bahamas.
Now where can we go?

Some place that we love.
Some place that the audience will love.

Wait a minute.
You always get to pick the location.

In fact, you always get to pick the
stories, the cast, and the crew, too.

This time, I'm putting my foot down.
It's my turn.

Do not take this responsibility lightly.
I will cherish this moment forever.

[Upbeat pop song]

Don't tell me you're down for hanging
with Keegan, the bratty daughter...

And Chad and Jill and
their bratty daughter Keegan...

and their nerdy son, Griffen.

Your daughters and their friends,
they're, they are...

Just a typical string of...
Can we start over again?

I never liked you.
So, when should I start my line?

I think, you can go ahead and start.
Right now?

Yeah.
What's my line?

What is it?

Good day. Sorry. Good day.

So, what kind of fish is this?

This is a spotted...

I'm on it.
How late does that make them, Judy?

Tight.

If we were at home,
it would have been 45 minutes.

I would've...


So tell me, Mary-Kate, I mean...

So tell me, Mary-Kate... Madison!

But don't you see it?

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.
