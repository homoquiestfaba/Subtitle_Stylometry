This film is a true story. Some names, characters and events

have changed or created through collaboration.

Please, call the people where my son works?

Do not worry, the detective will see to that.

LPW Constructions. You tell that to the detective ...

Can I speak to the detective?

Come you back, but the day after tomorrow.

What say you?

Missing persons we have to wait 48 hours.

You forgot to sign. - I'm sorry.

48 hours, particularly teenagers.

Why say "particularly teenagers?

Because they often disappear and come back spontaneously.

Sorry to bother you ... but he's 4 months ago last seen.

You'll still be surprised how many young people are missing, such as your son.

16-17000 last year alone in Chicago.

Many of them show themselves again, for the rest ...

I am afraid that not enough manpower and time is available before.

But you're still him anyway, right?

Of Course. Do not worry, he will appear again.

Believe me.

DES PLAINES, ILLINOIS TWEE JAAR LATER

More I can not do it now, Chris.

Perhaps in the new year, okay?

What will it be?

I wish that I could give to storage. He works hard.

What you pay them anyway?

Part-time workers? $ 2.50 per hour.

You and your brother get away with murder there.

I start at $ 5 per hour.

How soon can you deliver again?

Hard to say. Everyone is working like a dog, that's not it.

I'm almost too numb in the van. - Turn the heater on.

Then I get to head cavity ignition.

I need additional screens for the holidays.

Teddy, what do you think?

Come on John, I've been worried enough work.

As soon as I can.

I saw this back. John Gacy, you know him?

He has done some work for Mr. Austin last year.

Is this what? - For a happy girl.

The anniversary of my mother. Would they like what?

She'll love it.

Can you wrap it for me? - Of Course.

Right Here. - What does that mean?

Pull him but aan.Staat you better than me.

Congratulations, Mrs. Gant.

Thank you, Cindy.Hoe you know that?

Chris said not me. When is it?

In a moment she would like to know how old you are.

Forty-six.

Mom? - Well I'm not ashamed to hear you?

Ready to go?

Actually, if you can wait. A guy came in here for some articles ...

and I think he has work for me.

He pays double for what I make.

Chris, wacht even!

You still freezes outside.

You're worse than my mother.

I'll be right back.

It's cold outside.

Chris?

He is not in the store.

What would be wrong with him happened?

I have no idea. Mr. Austin?

No trace of him. Both inside and outside not behind.

He said he would immediately come back.

Maybe he's just going to walk home. So far is not it.

Do not worry, there's nothing with him happened.

I'll call Gacy, just in case.

Maybe he'm given a lift.

You are connected to John Gacy, LPW constructions.

I'm sorry that I'm not there ... but if you enter your name and tel. No. Is leaving

I'll call you back as soon as possible. Say you message after the beep.

Vincent Austin here, call me as soon as you can on no. 555-1422

Mike, what are you doing up so early? - Basketball practice before the game tonight.

What game?

I'll be there. - Perched just me.

Then you do not like to get up early. - Look who's talking.

The man in the house yet you also need to put it to work?

Is not too bad though. Want some ice cream?

No, I'm late.

Sometimes I wish that your father was still wearing a uniform.

He also sometimes ...

When we saw him often - Okay, I understand.

Go you every morning so early? - I have to, new job.

It is the only way to keep it full.

You will certainly be fun? - Almost as if you with your basketball.

To whom should you play?

Chicago's Faith Baptist. Truly a fresh team.

That means they are good.

What is he doing in there anyway sense. - I'll be there more often.

I will instill me myself.

Come on, I'll take you there.

Look at the missing here. Cristopher Gant, guess what?

Expect some of this morning? - You could help me with it.

You have experience with this sort of thing. Office Youth.

Not therewith. In Chicago, but not here.

Mainly runaways from home and school.

Like what happened to this kid. - Maybe, or maybe not.

Nice kid so to see, right?

Student van de Main West Highschool.

That's the school where your son is going?

The boy had chores after school since his 12th.

Father or mother picked him up after work. Not really a typical runaway, do you?

Indeed.

Inspector Kozenczak, the couple Gant is here to talk about a missing person.

Okay, thanks.

Forward again.

When your son went outside, you knew for sure that he Mr. Gacy was

to talk about a new job?

He did not really have a name.

From whom did you do it?

Cindy Beck told me, she also works in the shop where Chris works.

He was so excited. He offered double what Mr. Austin 'gave m.

It's so hard to understand.

One minute he is with me in the store

in ...

You might want to sit down, Mrs. Gant?

Is there a reason why Chris could use extra money?

What does that make? - He was saving for a darkroom at home,

He is a very good photographer.

I offered him the equipment to 'buy m.

But he insisted on paying for it themselves.

He is quite independent.

Maybe too independent.

It says here Mr. Austin to Gacy has called home?

He was not, at least he took the phone in there.

And when Chris was still not come home we called his friends but ...

he was not there.

We then decided to drive around and for him to watch out.

But we could not find it so ... why I'm here.

Mrs. Gant, we will make every effort to "find m.

Dank u inspector.

I will keep you both informed.

Miss Gant?

Can I talk to you?

Can you think of a reason why you brother may run away?

Maybe he did something that your parents were not allowed to know?

Of course not.

What do you think does not it? That he would be a problem child or something?

Is something bothering you?

Tonight said a police officer in the service that they wait 48 hours with missing persons,

before they even would do something.

I understand t.

And then there's that birthday gift. - Excuse Me Please?

Yesterday was the mother's birthday.

We waited for Chris to come home.

Wherever you work, I want you to go full time to this work until we find that boy.

Where is Atkins? - Free today.

Call him and tell him that he get the hell is here to help you.

Can not we better give it something a little more time? - No.

And shoot it already?

I am aware of, as I said,

if such an asshole you supply outlets.

Months of work, and no one that meets the description.

Okay, I'll still put away a unit.

Maybe they can try again.

Let Williams call me.

While you're in the mood, maybe you can help me.

I work me Fuck. - Yes, yes, we take 't it.

What did I tell you?

Inspector? - Not right now.

Such snot and then head too. - He's not a youngster anymore.

Leave for 15 years a lot of noise itself.

Been at the mall? - No.

Something?

Not much.

Austin does not remember that Gacy spoke with Chris Gant.

Mr. Gacy been achieved? - By phone.

He said he has not spoken staff in the drugstore.

The second time he came back briefly to pick up the agenda.

When Gacy spoke with Chris Gant about a job?

Maybe not at all. - How Come?

I have a number of people there who work there at the mall

and a few people saw Chris Gant outside but no one saw him together with the

description Austin gave that meets John Gacy.

The bottom line is that no one has ever seen Gacy.

How he sounded on the phone? - How can the phone?

He did not know there was a kid missing and could not help.

And something about the girl: Cindy Beck?

Secondary school. - And?

She has something to do with Chris, nothing special.

And further?

It's confirmed what Mrs. Gant said.

Chris said his mother wait because he wanted to speak to someone about a job.

What Mr. Gacy denies to give him.

Does she have any idea what happened to him happened?

Not exactly.

Not exactly?

Chris can do rather quirky and do his own thing.

No, he's not a runaway.

Not because of his parents and certainly not on his mother's birthday.

Okay, so I think once about now.

Okay, call Chicago and ask if they have a criminal Gacy.

If I could bet my money on it

I was already with my bare ass on the beach.

Does that size of your still as archivist at the dep. in Chicago?

Ask to trace him about it, maybe he can give us a foothold.

He only night shift.

Wait and call him then.

I have other plans.

I said, "Continue to wait and call him then."

I just think we see something on the head, it just does not feel right.

Let me know.

I think there is a kind of glamor is what attracts all bastards.

Have you already achieved something? - Just now.

In?

Chicago has two indictments walk on John Gacy.

For what?

Assault.

The first was an assault five years ago.

Case settled and a second year of July this year, business is still ongoing.

What was the nature of the assault? - No idea.

How do you mean? - That's all that buddy of mine said.

Well, call him back.

Look, he has channeled me without permission.

Now when I go to Chicago tomorrow to see the rest?

No, could be too late tomorrow.

Joe, we know that sexual assault Vanalles could be ...

Physical contact and threat, heh ...

Why not wait and then come to a conclusion?

We will be too late.

I'll see you at Gacy's house as soon as possible.

Yes exactly, as soon as possible.

I will have to miss a game again.

It does not matter.

Is it about Christopher Gant?

Everyone at school is talking about it.

Will you find him? - I hope so.

Will it go well? - I do not know.

Sorry, I got held up at the office.

How far will we go?

If he can not enter late and not talking to you, then go home.

What are we going to do? - Everything to free the boy.

When he's inside at least.

What we have now actually ... two charges on assault ...

There is a missing teenager. - What's not in the last 24 hours?

Listen, I hope I'm wrong ...

and that this guy is nothing to do and nothing wrong with that Chris ...

but I would my doubts about this matter.

We want your conscience does not take into doubt. - Thank you.

Come on, let's go inside.

See how far we get without a warrant.

The slightest indication that the boy is, if he do not let us.

Have you seen that? - What?

A shadow.

No.

What do we do now?

I did not hear that bell, sorry, I was in the canteen.

Inspector Kozenczak, Des Plaines Politie.

Investigators Williams and Atkins.

We investigate the disappearance of Christopher Gant.

I'm sorry but I can not say more than I have already said by telephone.

That's strange because there was a witness that you have seen the boy talk outside.

That must be a mistake.

Shall we just go in and brightening?

Of Course.

You do not. He alone.

Sorry I was so curt.

Just got home to relax me a whole day's work, you know.

But there is this witness. - Who's lying.

Even if he claims that the boy got in your car?

I told you that he is lying.

Of u lies.

Think again carefully, there is something you can remember about Chris?

No, no, nothing. I hope you find him you will.

Wait a second ...

I want to show you something.

Do you see that?

Hulpsherriff, discernment, charity what I do for the police.

Then you will understand the more that I sit with question marks.

Objection or I may just quickly search the house?

Of course, you have a warrant?

No, sir, I did not.

Then as soon as you opdondert.

Do not open the door? - Is that an order?

Satisfied?

I want you to come with me to the office. - What the hell?

Statement about your goings last night.

I can not.

Why not?

My uncle died last night.

Therefore, I was at the pharmacy, Chicago hospital, but check.

I'm waiting on phone from my aunt. She is counting on me to arrange the funeral, etc.

Why do you call her now on, what's her number?

She is not home.

Listen, you do not understand how sad I am?

I love my uncle.

I love both.

I will come to the office, if I have the opportunity.

Do not wait too long with it.

You have no respect for the dead.

I'll give you an advice. What's his name?

Kozencz ... - Kozenczak.

I have very good connections with the Chicago Police dep.

We are not just Chicago Des Plaines.

I'm waiting for you.

Police are nosy, you know?

Theodore Koslo, working under supervision for Gacy.

Did he say?

According to Vincent Austin was Koslo at the pharmacy last night.

He would also have been able to talk to Chris about a job.

Call Chicago tomorrow morning and ask if they have something about him.

And give me all about the indictments Gacy.

I want one of you to continue to post here

to keep the house in the holes.

You can not constantly keep an eye on. - I'll do it.

Terry, say it?

The van went off in a hurry.

I tried to follow him. - Where did it go?

I was trying to say, I'm lost.

Okay, go home and go and get some sleep.

How did 't with the game?

They have won.

En Michael? - First.

He missed you there. - I do too.

All is well with him? - Sure.

Yet discovered something on that guy?

Michael could not just walk away.

Christopher Gant either.

I just know that.

I do not know what I should do.

If I had a little longer this work ...

I just do not know how to act.

You shall know.

What did you always unsubscribe in uniform with fines.

Questions and information about Christopher Gant, the missing person.

Priority and widely spread.

He should be somewhere outside. - Let's hope so.

Kozenczak inspector's office?

It is Mr. Gacy.

Listen, I'm sorry that I can not make it tonight.

I was on our way, some ice bought the car in a ditch came back.

And it took forever for him to get out of there.

If you do not believe, you check it.

No, I believe you, Mr. Gacy.

Do I still come?

And, and ... oke.

Koslo HÃ© ...

Let the kid just work.

Copies of the pictures there.

Looks nice, that kid.

Koslo? - Chicago is to control it.

It seems that you were right.

Investigation Command on Gacy.

Thank you. The other building. Send lawyers for it.

I share your concern for the missing boy, inspector.

What do you have for a warrant?

Two copies of a search warrant Gacy, concerning sexual assault on young men.

The lawsuit is the first commandment that he imprisoned a guy in his garage.

Assaulted him repeatedly and left him for dead.

The boy escaped. - Let me see.

Gacy denied the allegations, the case was declared admissible.

The kid was sitting in prostitution, had a progressive character

and was a respectable businessman.

If they believe that boy, then Gant was not missing.

The second thing? - Still open, the same charges.

And the boy? - Do not be talked about.

Let him talk. - He left the city immediately after.

What do you make of that Mr. Gacy was a respectful businessman?

Under these circumstances, I do not think I can convince the judge that.

Joe Kozenczak? One of your men want to talk to you.

Gacy has shown itself, as no one wants to speak with you alone.

He does not have much patience.

What did you do there last night?

Start there but not over.

Listen, let him see his rights, take his statement on

But Terry, whatever you do, do not let it go until I get back.

I want to know what he has to say. - I am convinced that

Chris Gant's in there, and I want him to have it out ...

before more with him happens.

Don will help you to submit your request.

Mr. Gacy, reminds you specifically who you gepsproken still in the hospital?

What is this doing? Please do not give me seriously?

A nurse can not remember you.

The damn I do not care what they may or may not remember.

I need you to prove anything.

I can tell you that my charters to show the wall. Businessman of the year.

I can show you as my bank account, my tax papers.

Who have you spoken after the inspector you have spoken?

I'm told that I was, you never talk to each other or something?

How long will this take? I have to run a business.

I still do payouts. Since you obviously know nothing about.

John Gacy? I'm in my already met a few times in different functions.

Do you really think he is a child is molested?

Ja, sir.

I understand that my client has given full cooperation?

Six hours completely discarded. - Yup?

I do not understand that you refuse "to let him go?

This man has built a reputation in his field.

Let wegggaan here. Let them get the Fuck.

The Fuck with that sissy of a Polock.

Mr. Gacy, I would like to recover the keys to your house.

What For? - I can comb the area.

I guess you'll have to give them.

If you do not, you'll need a new door.

How did you manage that?

I would also like to have an answer.

I think you should talk to your client.

You've obviously done with me, huh?

Has Mr. Gacy made a statement? And has he signed?

Not yet. - I would like to have it there again on ...

but this time with a lawyer to make it formally signs.

Do you remember something here? What am I paying you still stand for?

To handle your business.

If you're there, be sure to check the garage.

Chris? Chris?

Look at that moment.

A sign of a boy in the garage? - No, nothing.

No sign of him.

There are stains on it, I think that's blood.

I can give that answer about when I 't take away to the lab.

Okay, you have pockets for this evidence? Get them together with your camera.

We go through everything again and this time we are looking for material for us

links to Gacy and the disappearance of Chris. What are you waiting for?

We're too late.

The boy is dead.

Wait a minute, Ed?

Please take a picture of it.

Okay, in the bag it.

An unnamed ring with initials.

What year? - Not Christopher, initials LAT

Can definitely come in handy.

Ed, moor the office, everything.

Inspector?

A hatch in the closet here.

Open it. - I must have missed him the first time.

Wow, look at who's here. Are you going to arrest me or not?

We have found there enough, jewelry in a desk drawer.

Can you still something of ... - A shelf handcuffed them.

So it is quite enough, inspector.

You know as well as I do that you can not continue with this.

Not unless you actually comes with indictments.

If I notice that you've made a mess of it ...

Can Mr. Gacy's home ... - No one has to take me home,

I have my own car. - No you did not.

I'm seized for inspection together with the van.

Can he just do that? - I'm afraid so.

You have nothing on me. You're just to push me around.

Your nose rooting in my business. This is not work that way.

I'll take you home.

I wish you well, pain in the neck. - John!

That kid can thus get through this door, I would not even get recognized.

And nobody knows me!

A big collection of gay porn magazines.

Several panties ... too small for Gacy, men's wallets ... used but empty.

A wide collection of male jewelry:

watches, rings ... too small for Gacy's fingers.

Necklaces, bracelets, narcotics, drugs.

And a pair of handcuffs.

You're up late?

Test tomorrow.

How you doin '? - Much better.

Sorry about last time.

Play-Offs begin the day after tomorrow, can you come?

Yes, I hope so but.

Do you have time to buy a tree?

It is Christmas again, time for a tree to set up.

And progresses?

The boys at school keep me there for questions.

It is not very smooth.

Frightening.

New car, Mr. Gacy? - It's a rented.

This covers the damage? - Yes sir.

Maybe you want to play a game of pool?

Maybe some weed there?

Not tonight.

Listen, maybe we can arrange something for a night ...

only two of us. What do you think?

May Be.

I look forward to it.

Here ... Take it, take it, forward.

No, it's good. - No, but pack, pack only.

Thanks for the service.

You already have all your dep. stand on the matter and now you want ...

Atkins, Williams Gil Barton en Walden.

Yes that there are 4, the dep. 10 has.

Bastard.

I get permission to patrol 24/24 at Gacy?

With whom? The other half of your department?

Mike Paxton en de Delta unit.

These guys know how to supervise, and how to act.

Yes, I pick them off the street and all this sloppy here.

And certainly this time of year.

To detect a missing boy? - A murderer.

Wait a minute, Joe. You are going to accuse someone as being a murderer and

you do not even know if the kid is dead.

I have family that kid this morning sought.

I told them the courage not to give up.

But you've already done that.

Based on what facts?

I do not know. Based on feelings.

Stuff we found in Gacy's house ...

The weapons and the two assault charges against him ...

Planned assaults. The two can retell their story.

Which Gacy thought there was one death.

You're not too much involved in this case?

Besides, you and Mike Paxton ... No, no, it's better between us.

Not that either of the two veterans hate me.

I have no Head made to make it a game.

I chose you out of all elderly people because I think you're the smartest.

Do not get me wrong. - I do not.

Gacy hold so long yesterday, was not very smart.

Can I turn on Delta?

You know what Christmas means to me?

Even more problems.

Let Delta cowboy's that guy's not too acidic.

Otherwise, we are faced with a lawsuit.

Thank you. - Not so fast, I believe you have some business

your department some straighten.

Hey, it is not my intention to sit on your mind.

It's all in your head.

If this does not work, I pull out the plug.

Listen, Joe ...

Ease in Paxton, okay?

He has quite a state. - I get Delta or not, that you have ...

I said you have my approval.

It is up to you to get the cooperation of Paxton.

Christmas ...

What will you do?

I put all the men to follow the right track.

You drag it Unit at Delta, but it can not care what we do.

Bill, can you excuse us, please?

I might advance you should have.

That would have been nice.

It was not necessary, but it would have been better.

What is all this?

I have appointed Bill Walden to Offcier Information.

He keeps everything on reporting on the case.

Why do you want that guy so much chase?

I want to press' exercise m, figure out what it did with the body.

Do you think it's so stupid that he goes back there?

If I'm staying shake ...

perhaps he leads me to a place where he or she can not hide so well.

You hope but. - There is only one way to find out.

I have here my men for UP or ....

Come on Mike, are you going to help me or not? This guy killed a kid!

It could have been your son, or even mine.

Do not let me down. - How far do you want us to go?

Surveillance only. He wanders all around around.

We're going to sit on the heels that will scream for help.

But you want him to show that you're there.

Just supervise.

You will not make you very popular along with this contest.

What are your initials again? - LAT

Leonard Alexander Thomas. Dat is T.H.O.

This is rather disturbing for them.

Another one. Trask. Lester Aaron Trask.

Gee, I hate funerals.

Do you come here often? - Father would find it inappropriate.

He would want you to love him. He does.

Sorry I was not there not there.

Are you from the police, huh? Yeah, thought so ...

I have a lot to do with it lately, good cops.

What is John? - Nothing, a bunch of assholes.

Is something wrong? - No, nothing to worry, just go.

Put her in the car, I'll be right there.

Why do you follow me?

That Pole, is not it? Why he's picking on me?

What I'm done?

Chris will come soon, I'm sure.

He'd better have a good explanation when he comes here.

That he certainly will.

I might take a look in his room?

I'll do it.

I feel so bad that I appealed to that day.

Not have to, it's good.

And ... where do you want it with me?

I have arranged for a team determines scans area ...

along the river.

I need clothes that Chris has ever worn ...

so dogs can go off on the smell.

That sounds not very good, is it?

You'll find Chris for us, right?

So we can bury him at least decent.

Promise me that you the man that has done does not get away with.

Mr. Trask, I have reviewed the yearbook and ...

your son is one of them with the initials LAT

It looks like the ring that I bought for Lester.

Mr. Trask?
Uhh, ja.

I'm talking about the ring?

Our son has been missing for almost two years.

Let him know you're there, okay?

But do not be a hero.

That's his car indeed. Where's it going so quickly?

No idea. - Your "Go to really grab that kid?

That's what it says Kozenczak.

Where are you guys so long?

Beginning bastard arrest me for speeding or what?

HÃ©, Doug!

Ho Ho Ho, iedereen!

How is John? - All right, I want some.

Gentlemen, you are John's bodyguards?

Who is that guy there, with our 'employer'?

That's Ted Koslo.

Well, I can tell you anything?

We have service.

Commissioned by Mr. Gacy? - No.

Have fun, gentlemen.

We take him? - What For?

Possession of drugs.

He asks for it.

He gets his sentence not.

John, what are you doing?

Can you just tell me what's going on?

You've done it again kind to each other today. - I appreciate it.

We do what we can.

I really think they can help - A medium?

Give me a break, say. - There are plenty of departments here.

How much did you tell her? - Nothing.

All they know is the local news that a boy is missing.

All I know you could use any help.

Trask, Lester. A. For two years missing.

What did the Chicago Police, according to the parents about the disappearance?

Not so much, according to Mrs. Trask. - How can that be?

Their son, possession of a hatchback 3-4 years old who is also missing.

The police came there with a friend of his who still know Lester said

that he 'm would sell.

Lester said he was tired of his job and that he needed money to go away.

Do you think that happened? - No.

Why not?

He never collected the money from the company.

Which company, LPW? Roberts Laundry, Chicago.

I'm sorry, Joe.

Something of the proofs of the technical report?

Nothing, I'm afraid.

And the blood I've found that board?

Type 0, Chris' blood and also so that half of America.

You need to talk again with Mrs. Trask.

That ring is not from himself walk into Gacy's house.

Joe? Lester's car, a 3-4 year old hatchback?

Invigilators Demarco and King.

Gacy, together with a certain Ted Koslo to leave 02.00 property ...

with a hatchback, a redhead, 3-4 years old.

What?

We have all the time behind the wrong sittest?

This may be just a coincidence.

Not with a registration number.

Terry, I do not believe in coincidences, not with this.

Only the consequences. Lester Trask missing.

His car is missing and Koslo drive it around.

What we have Koslo? - Not much.

I've put in my time Gacy, what do we have?

Burton has some checked.

Current address, 2144 Rock Ridge Drive. - Ten minutes from the Austin pharmacist.

And he was right there when Chris Gant disappeared.

And Gacy also and found Trasks ring in Gacy's house.

Koslo Gacy lived with for three years.

6 months ago they almost get married.

At least we have that point of reference.

Gacy was also married.

You're really helpful, Bill.

Gacy and Koslo, has there ever been a warrant of Koslo?

No condemnation both here and in Chicago.

Maybe he is smarter than I ever thought possible.

Get him here, and we find out.

How's it going, sir?

Before.

I get calls all the time. People who worry

you might be back in the wrong seat.

They say he is trustworthy.

I keep it in mind. - Nice.

I do not think we do nothing, what should not.

It's more that we can achieve anything, then we should.

I just do not want you to dig a hole for yourself.

It is only one thing, not a career.

I'll remember that.

That bastard is trying to murder us!

Hey, guys, problems to keep me?

I'm here for my new lawyer. Jake Burns.

Do you know him? - No, sir.

Well, you still. He is smart, very smart.

He knows how he can Kozenczak tiling keep chasing me

without any reason.

You know, it's just too bad.

I think it's pathetic how you are being hunted down by outdated Pool.

John has sold it to me, $ 350, -

What? - One year ago.

Maybe longer ago. I think it has deceived me.

That piece of junk slurps oil.

Did you get a receipt from there?

You're right, I was there but thought of.

But you have the registration papers, of course.

Lost.

Very unfortunate.

Row you who rides to Austin pharmacist?

When was that? - Four nights ago.

The night that Chris Gant was gone.

Is it all about that? I drove that LPW van.

Twice, or not? - Yup.

The second time I was commissioned by John back to pick up that book.

That car from him some problems.

We left as soon as possible.

Where did you go?

Home. That woman of mine, but there is not enough of it.

Have you ever seen or talked to Chris Gant?

John said I did, he's lying.

John with him spoken?

How the hell should I know?

Came the name Lester Trask it for?

He had never heard of. Gacy lying.

He has seen a kid that Gacy took to LPW.

He says he has never done that.

Say it well, tell him that he was waiting for.

Has he given you names? - He said he can remember nothing more.

What you actually carry out there?

If you feel better, go ahead. - Pardon Me.

Sorry, we're all tired. The case requires too much of us.

Yeah, okay.

I thought you knew that he had two sides. That speech he gave.

But when it comes to sex ... - Who?

Those guys work with him, I've told you.

What guests?

You can not remember? - I'm not lying.

You have with him talking on the toilet.

Has happened to them? - How about it, Ted?

What? - They are all gone?

Why do you ask it not him? - Because I ask you.

You were at the pharmacy then disappeared Chris.

You drive around in a car belonging to a missing boy.

John has sold me. - John, it's always John.

You have nothing to do with it?

What do you want from me? - The truth.

You are way off, I have not screwed those boys.

Right, that was John. - Yes but ...

But what?

He's not such a bad guest. He is good.

And all that talk right? - You're almost crying.

What he did with all those boys?

It was because of his father. He could not be there when he died.

Why could not he be there, Ted?

How should I know?

Where he was, Ted? - What does that make?

Well, do you think he did it?

Do you think he has told us everything he knows?

Listen, I want you to investigate Gacy, something I had much rather be doing.

It's not your ... - No, no ... my mistake.

Work right there.

inspector, a lady for your office. - Okay, thanks.

Terry, tell me about it, okay? - What do we do with Koslo?

Atkins let take over.

Thank you for coming.

I just got your message.

It said that you wanted to talk about John?

You know we are separated?

I 'm not seen for two years. I do not know what you have to say.

Gacy.

I want to start an investigation into him.

Thanks You.

It was a few months after our marriage.

We made love and then he said ...

He said that the last time he enjoyed my presence ...

because he had other feelings.

Certainly sounds funny, is not it? - Not at all.

Then he began to invite men.

Guys, really ...

And he pulled into the garage the next morning.

Ever been in the garage?

Just to see what all was there?

He kept him always locked.

Moreover, it all did not matter.

Why did you stay with him?

I have two girls from my first marriage.

I had money on him need to take care of them.

John has ever talked about his father?

No. - About his youth?

Only children for 'm working, they did everything for him.

Do you know if there was something happened to them?

You mean that he brought to the garage? - Yup.

Like what?

As for example, someone was missing?

There was a telephone call ...

a father who said his son was missing ...

and John called him back.

Has he ever called a name?

A certain Trask, perhaps?

Miklovich.

I remember, it was something turkish or something.

I was with my child outside and heard over the phone.

What did he say?

That he had better things to do ...

than some stupid kid that dropped him.

Worked this child for him?

Are you sure he said that?

Thanks to u.

Kindly thank you for coming.

I appreciate it very much.

You tell it anyway not against John? - No, of course not.

He knows where I live. - I don 't understand.

I have it.

The reason he was not at home when his father died ...

he was wasting his time in prison at the time.

For what? - Sodomy.

Sodomy?

Waterloo, Iowa, nine years ago.

Terry, please contact Waterloo, and find out if there boys were involved.

I already did.

Files are locked, and the guy who works there is new ...

and has never heard of.

And the boss there, I know it's late ...

Is on vacation, left today.

Chose a good time, not?

I go on, right away tomorrow, okay? - No, I'll do that.

I want you to name natrekt who gave his ex-wife to me.

I just do not know if it is spelled correctly.

A missing boy? - I'm afraid so.

There was a call for you. Des Plaines, Illinois.

What was the message? - He said he was from the police.

What a miserable holiday weather.

Ja, Waldron hier.

Yeah, listen, we're working on a missing person here.

I reason to believe that John Gacy involved.

You dutiful officer told us that you

was the right person to talk about that sodomy conviction.

Do you know that thing yet? - Yup.

What was the age of the missing? - A teenager.

Guys? - Yes 16.5 years old.

That's exactly his flesh.

Waterloo was his Allessie. Taught at a Sunday class.

The boys were all the time for him to work.

Two years. - How did he get away with?

He paid his way off. Something that could not bear the light.

Some have told their parents.

What did he do with them?

Kept them in his house, one by one.

Captivated their feet on a shelf.

A rope wrapped around their neck ....

While he ... uuuhm ...

Let them loose again after a month or 18.

One of the boys ever missing?

No, fortunately not.

When she'm finally had indicated he escaped.

Does he have one slain there?

And.

My son has been missing for three years next November

He worked for LPW when it happened? - Yup.

That night when the old man died.

I tried him several times to call, but he never called back.

The Chicago Police dep. anything taken?

I do not know. May Be.

But you have to pick the man.

I've seen him once when he brought my son home from work.

I saw how he looked at him.

You are all the same.

You do not listen because I do not do so well understood.

No, that's not the problem.

It's not your fault.

Gerald was not so big but looked very good.

Blond hair, blue eyes. Blue eyes like mother.

You tell me please ...

He can still come back after such a long time?

Quite a chore that you do.

Yes, it is exactly what Bill wanted ...

and the rest of the team.

I've never seen something similar ends.

But I see no prospect

which could lead to Gacy.

Nothing at all, since the disappearance of Chris Gant.

Come on, look at Iowa?

Trask en Miklovich and?

That is not evidence. - Okay.

And you know ... - Yeah, okay, I will get there.

It seems that you lost your perspective.

What?

What? In what way?

The rest of your dept. runs in the background.

Some of the team come up with the hours they have put into it.

And who are they, Mike Paxton?

Have you found transport?

Believe me, I try. I'm working on it.

It is a difficult time of year to have to rent something ...

It's just a tough time, period!

And I have to believe in it but because he is right!

It is too idiotic for words, you had the task of ensuring!

I can no more time to spend here, Joe.

Here are the detection commands. - Yeah, put it there.

That should go to the court.

In ...

What?

And create concise summaries of the communications of the case.

Office inspector Kozenczak you speak with.

Rachel Grayson.
Wie?

The media mieke lady.

I'm sorry, the inspector is not present.

Oh yes, he is.

And I have no need to know to find out.

What did she say?

No, I'll take it though.

Listen, Miss Grayson, I appreciate ...

I'll be there.

What have you found?

Tire tracks. - Where Do You?

Near the river.

They lay in the snow.

They are there as long as when it disappeared boy.

What's more?

We found just down the river.

Rather heavy? - A body?

Could be.

Can you uitdreggen the river? - Has become entirely ice.

If he's your boy dumped there,

you will not find it earlier than in the spring.

What's with those tracks, they knock the old tracks?

No.

And the MPL bus? - No.

The tires were new?

In the front, it seems like it.

And the spare tire? Did you checked?

Of Course. - Check them only once for me.

No!

And the dogs found something?

An odor detected?

No, he or she must have really well washed.

What does that dog there?

In this position?

He reacts if a body is found.

He has been hanging out all morning.

That's Gacy's car.

Bragg, you have researched this vehicle and found nothing?

Nothing At All.

When this had happened before, which was then widely accepted as evidence?

No.

The next trick. The Indian rope trick.

But for this I need music.

What does he do? - No idea.

Look at you ... like a snake comes up.

Boys and girls ...

For my next trick I need an assistant.

Who wants to help?

No, no ... I need a smart guy.

Very talented and very funny.

What do you think?

Sure, come here.

come on guys, let him come here!

Would you help me?

What is your name?

Brian Hollister.

Brian Hollister will help me with the handcuffs trick.

The handcuffs-trick, indeed!

For this trick we need handcuffs, right?

No, no, no, we have real needs.

I know where we can get real.

Stay here, I'll be back.

Okay, we are going here then.

Guess where we can find true? Here they are.

Do you want me to say something?

What's wrong with my car? I need them for my business.

You get them back when the investigation is over.

For Real? Well, the investigation is over.

I'm going to sue you, and you pat. 1 million.

How flavors of apples now, stupid?

Do not have nightmares? Terrible nightmares, Mr. Gacy?

I do.

Mr. police, do not you know that a clown

can get away with murder?

Look guys and girls .... handcuffs!

Okay Brian, turn around and put your arms behind your back.

There we go.

Give me your wrist. Then we do one here ...

and the other to do so. Nice tight so?

Really, really tight so?

Okay, Brian, very good.

Well now kids, here comes the trick!

To be continued ...

This film is a true story. Some names, characters and events

have changed or created through collaboration.

PART II

Okay, let's start with these pine trees. Keep your dogs on hand

and eyes open.

Hallo, Mr. Gacy.

Call me John, okay? - Yes, sir.

You know why Koslo had such a hurry?

No, there is something?

He went looking for the stock.

When does the bus back. - Fast, fast, damn fast.

Billy, I've ever seen.

You work well. - Thank u.

Want to come along once, play a game of pool?

Of Course.

Beautiful.

It does not really help this Christmas.

Those guys are not there.

When they come back, debrief them equally and they're gone.

They are good guests, Mike. You have a best team together.

I want them to do something, and do not pick their nose.

Want to get away, go away ... I do know best.

I do not like it, but understand.

The boss will be a lot happier

as guests again running a normal service.

Those guys Centauri want you to talk to that psychic lady.

Exactly what I need. - Good for a few hours.

In a few days it does not matter where Delta hang out, right?

By the way, our cars are scrap. - I know, I know.

I will try to provide replacement.

Flans them together. I do not manage the men together, the cobble.

Not for a while, but she's too Gacy quickly each time.

Are you OK?

Yes.

We appreciate that you've come by. - I wish I had better news.

You will still not give up, do you? - Nope.

It's like a nightmare.

I keep praying that I wake up and ...

Chris will be home.

Why would someone do? Why So?

He comes here not just walk away with it, do you?

No, not this time.

Mr. Gacy will not get away with it.

With Kozenczak, Connect me with Toni Centori personally.

Toni told me you needed something, something personal to the individual.

He wore a checkered sweater? a blue windbreaker ...

The description of the clothes was in the newspaper article.

You will not believe the supernatural, is it?

Did he have freckles?

Yes, a few.

And a mole on his face? - Yup.

Right Here. -he had a small birthmark.

It is not easy died.

That denotes quite cross, right?

Of Course.

No, I mean, that cyst on your back.

How did you know?

He will leave ...

when you've caught the killer.

His hands ... his hands are cuffed.

His hands were cuffed and he has deep cuts.

Deep cuts and a rope.

But not his hand.

He planned this.

He left that book so he had to come back a second time

to talk to Christopher.

He is a big man.

Big man, big arms.

Big hands and a black jacket.

A leather jacket, he works with his hands ...

That is Gacy.

His eyes ...

Behind his eyes ...

That was not in that newspaper article, Joe.

He is so smart.

So smart.

So proud of himself that he cheated people, no guilt.

Has no guilt at all.

There is an instrument.

A shelf.

He let suffer Christopher lot before he died.

Can you tell me something about that ...

what he has done with the body?

No.

Please, I need to find Chris.

I must find him.

This is perhaps the only way to find the killer.

Please ...

I see a building ...

and a tower, and something that connects the tower.

A machine, something with trucks ...

something with construction.

There are trees.

Lots of trees.

En water...

and a sign.

The words ... Evergreen.

And there is a large mound of earth.

I can not see what lies beneath.

I'm too tired, I can not do this anymore.

Do not stop, please.

Please, try it.

Where is heaven? I can 't not see!

The same people in the same dark place.

All those bodies.

Oh no ...

Do not let that be like then happened in Texas.

What are you talking about?

The man in Texas who tortured and killed all those guys.

Wat, Hanley? Arthur Hanley?

Is not that the man in Houston, who killed twelve guys?

How dan?

Miss Grayson, who dug the graves?

The man who killed Chris Grant.

There may be even more.

He comes here a long time away.

Holy shit.

Do you know what you are saying?

Do you understand themselves what you say to me?

How ... how can you be so sure of that?

I'm sure I've seen.

A psychic? - I said, until tonight.

Listen, the way she described Gacy, you can do it better?

No, I have all held back the papers, you know very well, Jack.

Sure, the next time you'll definitely Oui-Ja boards use?

We should hold a seance.

Forward, forward say ... seriously.

Listen ...

I know it 's Christmas, okay?

I know I have a lot of yellowing in the case,

and that you have a lot of hours into it.

Yes, and I have to justify myself to the boss for all that overtime.

I wish I was more into this box.

I wish I could understand you better.

I wish you would understand me better.

It is not you, Joe ...

it was the lady.

Okay, maybe you're right.

Maybe all they told me the last time it nonsense.

But what I'm trying to say is, what if it is not?

What if they're even right?

What if that bastard now has even done what she said.

And we have to deal with a mass murderer?

Not only Christopher Gant, or Trask and all others that we know?

Only God knows how much he has helped soap.

What I'm saying is, what if she's right?

If we stop now with it ...

If she's right ...

and we did not do anything to stop off this guy?

How Chris Gants must still go to die?

What I ask is a few extra days.

Just a few more days.

What do you think?

Can I talk to you, sir?

Can it wait? - I'm afraid not.

It is important.

Go ahead, we'll wait for you.

What happens there?

I want a second search warrant. - Forget it.

I have new information. - From whom?

That I have a phone call this morning. - I do too.

Gacy's lawyer.

Burns, about what?

A lawsuit that he tightens against you and the whole corps.

His client has warned.

Why was not I informed?

I do not know,

I thought he blew but what the high towers.

$ 750,000 worth.

Wrong threats, unlawful interference and

the impossibility to carry out his business,

rather that damages his reputation. And so on.

When does it occur?

A day or two at the end of the week at the latest.

He goes for a restraining order

and research should be put stop. - What?

The judge will assign him that? - There you can count on.

You can not fight it? - On what grounds?

Moreover, Don told me

that he was anyway has become.

I'm already late.

We voted, while you were gone.

Popularity contest? - Something like that, yes.

And I won or lost?

We decided ... - We all are.

that we are here with you.

Thanks You.

Let's hope we can keep enough distance Gacy.

Mike, what did you tell your men?

You take out? - Yup.

Speak.

So far he has played a game with us,

let's turn the tables for once and make him mad?

We put him under so much pressure that the bad in him comes out.

We're so close to him that we'm able to turn on his back.

He might find fun too.

I want him cornering, Mike.

Let him think that we are closer than he thinks.

There's something bothering me for days, I could not tell what it was.

Then this morning, after the meeting, I looked at how the maps layers.

It was the second conversation with Mrs. Trask.

She told me that there are other things were missing ...

including a portable TV that she him had given.

What is that?

One of those photos that the technicians of the

evidence taken into Gacy's house.

Do you remember that office in Gacy's bedroom? -Yup?

Look what the desk on top of state?

Mrs. Trask holds papers of her son's stuff?

I'm going over there to see if they can find the guarantee certificate.

Anything but also to identify with numbers.

Must be a lot of work.

No, it is worth it.

Applies to everything we this bastard even catch them.

I will let you know. - Good work, Terry.

Not bad. - They are all good.

When Gacy but is not better.

Mike, I want to see what happens

if we confront him with all the names of the missing boys.

Worth to try.

The description of the lady where the dead are ...

have you recorded it?

The last time I went there ...

I've spent the whole night sufgepiekerd in Des Plaines.

Everything came up. That scout camp there in '76?

I am admitted to go.

Am still searching. - You let yourself fool anyway, I hope?

She had left the cyst on my holy foot.

What did she say?

She told me that the pain would stop when Gacy would catch you.

I knew you had a personal interest in this case.

Yes, I must go. It feels right this time, huh?

Mrs. Trask? Still on the papers of the TV to your son?

I'm sorry, I've looked everywhere.

The warranty card, right? - Yes ma'am.

He stands by that guy? - It could help.

You know, the last few days they came up with that ring ...

I thought at times, but that was never done.

The final blow comes so hard.

The fact that he will never come back.

The last summer holidays in LA were

we are with Lester on the beach there and ...

A while we hoped yet. We gave it a moment.

I'm sorry that we have caused you more pain.

Yes you do ...

I will go again looking for that paper.

And this here? - Member of the family, recently deceased.

He was there a few days ago.

This is John Gacy's father?

Excuse me, sir, but why are you here?

It has to do with the newly deceased?

Yes, but not this.

Look, it may sound a bit macabre ...

This thing I'm doing, runs a little in this direction ...

What is the chance that someone got here?

Let's say during the night,

that he buries oneself?

It is quite possible.

We have only two guards walking around at night.

Here?

My dear heaven.

Do you think?

You must have permission ... - No, I understand.

Can you give me the name, please?

A tower ... equipment.

Trucks are there, something with construction ....

And there is a large mound of earth,

I can not see what lies beneath.

It may be a body.

Can you agree to tell you what there was to it uitvreten?

Mr. 'foreman' of that construction company called you sure?

That he has indeed done, damn it.

What does the dep. there do not find?

Chris his body might lie underneath.

And all for such a psychic figure?

Who talks about her controlling everything here.

Both buildings.

Revealed?

Have you told Carlson anomieme about that call?

Approximately, my mistake.

It's your fault that everyone knows about that paranormal human.

I would suggest that all research but stopping right now.

But you do not.

No. And do you know why?

Why So?

Because if you Gacy not arrested during his short hairs ...

Not just your career is now at stake.

everyone runs the risk of being thrown in court.

Why So? I'm the one who did it.

And I've accepted that. - He's as guilty as hell.

I hope so.

And it's not just Chris Gant more. - I know that.

We will seize him? - Who do you mean?

We, the team, they believe in it.

Is that including Mike Paxton? - Yup.

Ja, new ...

Much time you have no more to prove.

I think it must give permission to pay.

Thanks You.

What's a few hundred dollars compared with 750,000.

Listen, Joe ...

Pull it not to you personally. - But?

I do not think you will succeed.

That bastard has too many connections, too smart for us ...

We ... - You're wrong.

We'll know in a few days, right?

Good night, Joe.

You sit outside your district so look no problems.

A bit dimming can also.

Get out here. - Not that blonde, it is tasty.

John says it's okay.

Will you might come along, something to drink?

Sounds good, if I say so myself.

Wait, who are you do not, damn it?

Those are my guards. You still get greetings John Miklovich.

He said he works for you.

I remember one with such a name. Do you?

He described your otherwise good. Coarse, big belly.

What you drinking, John?

Who do you know who you're talking to?

I want your name and rank. Write it down.

I'll throw you in court, along with that stupid pole.

You're making a big mistake, John. We are completely on your side.

This pool has only enough guts.

I cock nothing more. - Right you are.

And let that shelf you see with those handcuffs.

That board, who do you mean?

Do you still have left more mess when you left?

No idea what he's talking about.

Shall we go to your house? Build party?

Do you care to supply?

We do not need, John? Bragg has enough nipples.

Well there you have certainly nothing to say anymore, do you?

Do you like dirty games?

How?

He knows very well what I'm talking about.

The car you sold him,

who belonged to one of those missing boys?

Do we have that, or what?

Have'm told that name?

How did he get the fuck up?

No idea, I'm not telling.

I beat the shit out of your mouth that, understand?

I swear to you. I do that with you.

And that car that you have an auction, you understand?

John, I've done what you told me.

That's right.

Everything I've ever said, ever.

Open it.

Hold on, John. What are you doing?

Open it.

The godvervloekte bemoeizieke smeris.

If he comes back here, but he can swim better.

Since we gestopgezet the water level has risen to pump.

That does not stop us from what is against all there.

Kozenczak inspector?

Hendricks here, from the construction company.

They have moved to earth for you.

Literally.

I do not know where you got that story

that there is a body below would sit.

Our lost time and lost your money. I'm sorry.

Pam, you call the boss's office? I'd better go to.

She has found it? - What you wanted?

Mrs. Trask. The papers of the TV of her son.

He is there. - Keep that serial number but at hand.

What was he doing there? - For a renovation job.

Or so he said.

He tells us what he does all the time.

He has not allowed us into his home.

Do you think it will happen again?

What For? - For those TV in his bedroom.

With or without a warrant?

We have that serial number

to see if he'll belonged to Lester Trask.

If they just look around, we're in deep shit.

We need it for this case.

Me to check, or them?

I'd have to check you, Mr. Gacy?

I can leave here when I want.

I could fly somewhere where nobody sniffs me ...

as BrzozÃ³w perhaps? - I would not try.

There is nothing that could stop me.

That's not right, and you're lying.

You are the one who is wrong, asshole. - Calm down, Mr. Gacy.

He is annoying, Mr. Gacy?

You take it well for him?

It'll do.

He is bothering you, John?

It is so good.

He's not like you guys.

You better do what he says little pool, heh?

But not for long, stupid!

Do you hear me? Not for long!

Do they have him identify?

Mr. Koslo was instructed to say nothing about the missing boys.

The next time he will deny that he

Gacy has seen that he messed around with them.

Okay, I said, but I do not know what he did to them.

Honest. Hey, inspector.

Can not you take me hard that I just believe?

Come on, you have not worked for him,

you're just a drinking buddy of him.

You partied with him, lived in his house.

Nothing against it? - You saw him with young boys in his garage.

He went after them, after I moved.

And then there's that car, which sold Gacy you.

Who belonged to one of the missing boys ...

where did that story come from?

Ask John? - Because I ask you!

A used car that comes from an auction.

And you believe that? - Yup.

If you remember one time I smile intentionally strike him off your face.

Ted, we need to lock Gacy.

Whether we hold you together with him ...

if you do not help us.

I can not tell you what I do not know, do you?

Indeed.

That is a polygraph, Ted.

A polygraph.

It can prove whether you are saying the truth.

But that is entirely up to you.

We can not force you to it.

What should you do?

It is icy cold.

Go complain to that pool of yours.

To hell with him!

Come with us, somewhere drinking.

Then we come back and watch some TV.

What do you think? - I gotta make some calls.

If you do not come with us, invite us get out?

Hear no evil intentions.

Have you seen Chris Gant? - Nope.

The machine says you're lying, Teddy.

Okay, I've seen. - Where Do You?

In the pharmacy, that night.

Have you seen Chris when he came out ...

to talk about a part-time job at LPW Construction?

No, I had already left.

Did you know that Gacy was waiting outside on Chris?

No.

Gacy Chris has taken home?

I do not know, I was not around, I went straight home.

Thank you for letting us.

Is beautiful here, John.

And can you shoot? - I do.

And what have you got? - Whiskey.

Same for me.

Wait, where the hell do you go to?

I have to go pee.

Hey, where's my drink?

Nice room here, John.

What hangs there, all charters.

Here You Go.

Is that you with Rosalyn Carter?

You bet.

She was a great first lady.

Nice too.

Man Of The Year, very impressive.

Yes they organized a big parade for me.

Jack?

What he carries in his shield?

Jack, what are you doing there?

A while yet!

Where is my drink, John?

Fuck off.

Flicker both here!

Hell out and leave me alone!

You know what we need!

Say that even at that damned Polish bastard of you!

Just do exactly the same!

And? - Gotcha.

You say something?

No, sir, what is it?

That we just try to find out.

I suggest that we go through list of places.

Maybe if that helps.

If the place you say something,

only answer 'yes' or 'no'.

Treeline Road. - At the river?

Yes or no.

No.

Summerhill Road.

No.

Gacy's huis.

Garage.

The bedroom.

The attic.

The crawl space under the house.

I'm not going any further.

Ever been there, Ted?

And as for Gacy, what will he do?

You knew damn well what would happen to me.

No.

No, Ted, you're wrong.

You gotta believe me, Ted.

I do not want that man gives someone grief.

No more.

I let him.

I let him do me once.

Since he has done this, I have become a real troublemaker, huh?

No.

What?

Say it to me.

What is it, Ted?

I had for him some pits dug down there.

In the crawlspace.

He said it was meant for downpipes.

Ms. Carlson is there? - Sorry, she just left.

It is very important that I speak to her.

They will be at home, but only very late.

Come on, tell me, what lies told about me that whole pool?

Nothing, I swear. - You lied to me, little blow.

I do not, call me not.

Oh no? Tell me then.

How dare those dastardly bag to sneak my home.

Come on, John. - I'm not lying.

Why he does so well to me, why?

I'm such a bad guy at all.

If I find out that you're lying to me,

I'll kill you, too, understand?

I'll kill you.

I will not screw up. - You could not come in?

I've been in, even in the bedroom.

Have checked the wrong number.

I looked at the model number, I had to have the serial number.

I was nervous, I admit.

I did about it in my pants.

It still had not decided.

That air, I think he let him shit everywhere.

I laughed not for you, I would also have been nervous.

It's just how the whole circus fare.

I gotta get outta here.

Come on, I'll buy you a beer to cry.

Detective? -ja?

Is that information that crawlspace put on tape, or not?

No, he was too far away from the microphone when he said that.

Too Bad.

And polygraph test, there is something true?

No, not really true.

Then there is still provided no evidence

Chris Gant ever been in Gacy's house.

What would you call proof?

Another search warrant?

What you need is a body.

Since I have that second command is needed.

Search the bodies.

It's late. - Sorry to bother you.

Not very.

By the way, there will be at the arraignment on Friday morning.

Friday morning? That still gives me three days.

You have luck, it had previously been.

Under these circumstances, I see you have not

command to get a search warrant.

Good night.

They follow us? - No, those are my bodyguards.

It's true. I do undercover work.

For the Chicago Police Special Unit.

That's between you and me, understand?

Yes of course.

Ho even, John.

Who is your friend?

My friend, Billy. we are going to play a game of pool.

Is that okay?

Of Course.

Fine, you guys doing your job well.

He would do anything, do you?

As he said, he knows we're here.

I've woken up.

That gives nothing.

You bought the tree. With Michael?

He wanted you not to bother.

Yes, that's something I promised to do with him.

How are things?

Not so good.

Come to bed.

I make you awake only when I leave again.

I do not care.

I miss you alone.

Me too.

What was that dentist again?

You mean Ernie Graham?

Ja, Ernie.

You should have married Ernie, when you had the chance.

It's never too late.

All those in the armed forces.

I still can not believe there is anything sinister in it.

I wish I was just a little smarter.

I only have to look at gacy and I'm already sick.

you're smart enough.

If there was a God ...

how would he then as a man so live?

He gives us life.

How do we deal with it is our decision.

Free will?

Free will murder innocent boys? - Hold on.

Hold on to interrogate me, in what I believe.

Stop punishing yourself so.

And will it?

Not so good.

I will give you at a lesson.

You take the shot. Hold the cue.

Make a strong bridge.

A smooth stroke and follow him.

That's better, huh?

Come on, try it yourself.

You must be lower.

Below, watch the cue.

That's him, gently.

What do you think of that?

Just lucky, he hit him just before.

You must be joking.

Maybe a few times.

And then a little harder.

They now call a recreational addiction.

And that's exactly what we do here, his recreational busy.

I know what you need.

You need something to drink.

And then we're going to play a game.

The best way to practice.

Those guys make themselves quite worried about you, huh?

And ...

There they are also paid for.

I start to get better.

Yes, you're a quick learner, Billy.

Maybe I'll learn something else.

And that is? - Just a little trick I know.

Here's your drink.

Come on drinking in one gulp, like a real man.

Very good, son.

Why locked? - The boogeyman.

Beer. The kid is still there, huh?

Are you quite freethinking what sex is concerned, Billy?

Pardon?

There are other ways to enjoy.

I have a girlfriend.

You'll have enough.

A handsome as you.

Thanks for the game and the time.

It was pleasant to me.

I have to go again.

Of Course.

One settler? - I really should go.

Wait a second ...

And that trick, then, that I still wanted to show?

I do not know. I have to go.

Hey, Billy. Denotes something?

No, it's just late and I must go.

Before long, I'll show you how it works.

Already done with your girlfriend?

Should I put on or something?

No, you do not order.

I do them.

What do you think of that?

Make sure they are tight.

You have them really tightly done, I'm not sure I ...

Wow, that is really tight.

Keep equally solid.

What a trick. - Yeah, huh.

How do you do that?

There's just one catch on,

I turnover if they are violated.

Give it a try.

Come on.

Give it a try.

Not that way.

You must have your hands behind your back.

That gives more of an impression. Then they do not see what you're doing.

Come on.

Good.

That is one.

That's two.

Forward.

Come on, try to get out.

It can not.

Hey, come on now.

Watch me.

Here You Go.

You know what the real trick is?

Dit is 'm.

The real trick is the key, stupid!

Hey, come on now.

Well do not do that.

Do not hurt me.

Please, do not hurt me.

Here You Go ...

Say again "please."

Here You Go.

Please, do not hurt me.

Come on, handsome.

Come on, say "please."

Here You Go ...

I bring my guest home.

You follow?

I'm sure he arrives safely.

It seems that we are crazy.

I'm sorry, I turned that on.

I can come home.

Do not be silly, it's no trouble.

Do you love your job, Billy?

And the money that you earn it?

Call this one but ...

bonus.

Suit.

Take it.

Think of it as overtime.

I'll take you home.

That dirty bastard put me under pressure.

He feels responsible for what I do.

I would him well for his head to shoot.

Do not worry, it's all over Friday,

it's like a nightmare.

If the lawsuit is ... - Stop those threats.

You sure? - Come on, John, believe me.

I have some of you or something? - Calm down.

A real bastard.

And that calls himself police? - You stink.

Like the house, John?

You do it in your pants, huh?

You have nothing to do with me.

I want both names on the list.

Along with Kozenczak, I want their names on that suit.

Quiet, John, it's not worth it.

Indeed.

Indeed, it's not worth it.

In a few days it's all over.

I have a message for you.

Tell that stupid pole of you,

Friday that the tooth for a tooth.

Sorry I'm not over come the last days,

I brought this camera.

Has it helped you?

Any news about Chris?

When are you going to arrest this man?

That is a matter for the police, dear.

We do everything in our power.

Chris made a lot of pictures.

And we have so little of himself.

Maybe there are some true,

if Cindy has some developed.

You coul us resolve to accompany the lunch?

Is dat Cindy Beck?

That girl who worked with him in the pharmacist?

Do you remember when that was, when they that role

took to develop?

I mean, it could have been when

Chris was gone?

Bragg...

That night when we were searching Gacy's house

I found a receipt for a roll of film,

you've encountered that?

That was a week ago.

That was a blue-white recuutje.

Is it important? - Yes, that is quite good.

That's it.

Envelope 48406, stood up to be developed

December 11, okay?

Ja, Cindy Beck.

Yes, but I do not see ... - We found it between Gacy's waste.

Yes thank you.

Cindy Beck, found? - Yes, fine ... thanks.

The school where she's told me she has swimming meeting,

she has not been reached then late in the afternoon.

Why is that thing there?

You have the declaration of the first day?

Nothing about what movie or receipt whatsoever.

When can we see her at the earliest?

The first bus will drop off the kids at school.

We will be waiting for her there, come on.

Hey, kid?

How you doin '?

Maybe you want to earn some money? - What to do?

Construction work.

You will not find that to earn,

Come on, get in.

Cindy, this is very important.

We found this in the house of a man,

we keep suspected to have killed Chris.

Here You Go.

I put 't in his jacket.

The jacket that he wore when he came into contact with his officer contractions?

He asked Jack to put on, because it was cold

but I did not think he would catch a cold.

She was sure she has attracted jacket that night?

Yes, definitely.

But Jack was not available during the search, right?

That jacket was not there, it recuutje though.

No ...

That's still not enough for a second command.

When is it?

When is it enough?

You forget that he has filed suit

against you and the whole department.

All the more reason!

Caution is advised.

Fotorecuutje that does not say much that Chris was in Gacy's house.

If it's a bit too fast for you, you'll still be surprised.

Be surprised?

Chris Gant is dood.

Other guys are dead, are you talking about ...

Hoskins ... you and Kozenczak take the statement

the girl once more by ...

I hear it in the morning.

Why do they suddenly have such a hurry?

She has season tickets to the bowls.

Shall we go through this just in my office?

Nothing office. Listen, stop here, asshole.

This nonsense can thus no longer continue.

We need a second command,

Gacy and his lawyer before us silenced.

Jake!

Jake!

Let that godverse Fuck gang at last stop!

They make me crazy, completely crazy!

They make me crazy.

Come on, let's see what we can do ...

do not worry, come on.

There they are, let them go, Jake.

It's good.

The Fuck with you!

We have commissioned Mr. Gacy to shadows,

that's what we do.

This is completely illegal!

Like kidnapping and murder ...

What are you still there?

Why do you talk with those two, damn it! Come here!

They sneak into my house, which is a liar Koslo ...

the herrieschopper!

Honey, I'm home.

Waking up.

Yet what happened?

Nope, still there.

Whatever you do, do not let it go.

Shoot at the tires of his car, as it should be.

What are you talking about? What is up?

It's just a beast. I still can not believe it.

You alright? You know not what you do, John?

Please, let me see a doctor before you settle.

Hands off, do not touch me.

Just like the fucking kids, you can not have one fag with it.

Net als Gant.

He deserves to die.

I just realized ...

Go behind it on. He runs off.

Sorry I woke you.

I could not sleep when I got home.

Something kept me busy, with regard to Gacy's house.

It is the smell. So he loves the place.

It could even kill that dog yet as he held it.

That was me already noticed, Joe.

It smelled just like it in Chicago PD

So crazy.

Like everything there to smoke in the morgue.

We go.

John, it's just a breakfast.

Watch out, I'll take you home.

I want you to stay with me a while.

Too many things to keep me busy now.

I find out what I'm gonna do, you drive.

Listen, he is sure how the smoke in the toilet.

It smelled so in the morgue.

While you had the urge to basketball games.

Or what the hell was.

How did you come into the house?

The weather was something illegal or whatever?

Yes, they have broken the rule.

Gacy let them into his house to have a drink,

while it was their duty.

Is it against the rules to use

the toilet of the accused?

If you tell me that you need more evidence for a second search

To check out what we have until now.

First, a fotorecuutje.

The recuutje what Cindy Beck stopped in the jacket

what Chris was wearing on the night when he disappeared.

The same recuutje I found in Gacy's kitchen.

We have an experienced policeman who convinces is

to have the death smelt from the fan

the toilet from Gacy's house.

The car sold Gacy Ted Koslo,

who happen to belong to a boy who also

missing turned whose ring was found in Gacy's desk.

Together with all other souvenirs of his victims

what a creep he only too happy to flaunt it.

Koslo, who has admitted to have dug pits

in the crawl space under Gacy's house ...

says that, in turn, that it was intended

for downpipes in the house.

And then another missing boy, Miklovich.

Turns out he has worked for Gacy.

And now reports my surveillance team, which nota bene

his own lawyer us begging him not to let it get away.

So you say me please: What do we need?

Don will help you to get out of a command.

Thanks to u.

I can do it themselves.

Maybe we should take a look.

He became fully krankjorem.

Threatened me nearly to death, now he wants to kill himself.

With this as a parting gift.

He had wanted to use it, honestly.

Pay attention.

Row'm chasing.

A fotorecuutje found in the house of the accused

during the search at 856 Summerhill Road.

It is tight to. - It will be there.

Delta-team, Paxton hier.

Gacy's is on its way to O'Hare.

How close are you to the airport?

Five kilometers.

Drives like a madman brings this way

yet everyone before reaching the airport.

You think he flies away?

That he Koslo said.

Arrest him and bring 'm here.

We can not, not yet.

On what charge? - How should I know?

That's your thing now, but let him get away under any circumstances.

It's up to you now, sir.

But if you bring him here with a silly accusation ...

and if you find nothing in the crawl space ...

then he will not only be released ...

but then he has the freedom to pursue you

and Des Plaines luttelele the amount of $ 5,000,000.

Why do you stop me?

Please come out of the car, you're under arrest.

What is the charge?

For possession and publication of illegal material.

Hey, Joe. - Let's get started.

It stinks terribly well here.

Boy, what a stench.

Let's hope it goes well this time.

What we smoke or not the first time?

The water has been added.

It makes the earth beneath looser.

There will also call from.

This is what has been outlined that medium. - We'll see what we encounter.

It is a furnace here. It is going to be difficult.

That is still much to be half-Chicago in prison, huh?

Moreover Koslo is a liar, so that will be no free note.

Is Mr. pole, leugendector himself there now?

I have all the time you want.

There may also be other charges, Mr. Gacy.

Like what?

That depends on what the inspector will find in your house.

Oh, he is in my house. Ooh, well, well.

Wait till my lawyer hears from there.

I think he will really my pinch this time.

He has a warrant.

That will'm not much help.

He will not find anything there.

Detective?

Call the coroner but.

There are here two, maybe three bodies here.

The remains of 25 boys who were

kidnapped, sexually tortured and murdered by John Gacy about

a period of six years ...

were found in the crawl space of his house.

The twenty-sixth victim was found

under the concrete floor of his garage.

Twentyseventh subfloor of the recreation room.

Your boss called and asked me to come here.

You're totally broken.

Too sad for words.

You owe me a locker, you know?

The pain is gone.

Exactly what she had said.

You've done very well.

The body of Christopher Gant was not found.

However, blue jacket was also found in a

hidden room behind the oven.

Inspector Kozenczak continued his quest continues to Chris Gant.

He had the family promised to find the body.

Four months later, when the Des Plaines and Illinois rivers were melted ...

... It was found.

Ja, het is Chris Gant.

No, no ... I will do it.

I'll talk to the family.

John Gacy was convicted of the murder

on Christoper Gant and 32 other young boys.

Condemn to death, he awaits his death sentence

in de Illinois State Penitentiary.

The method that was used by Joe Kozenczak and his team,

which led to Gacy's arrest, was used as a guide

the FBI's Training Of State and the local police force,

for the detection and arrest of serial killers.

He is not easily died.

Christopher has suffered just before his death.

It is really what I've seen.

There are trees ...

Many trees ...

En water...

And a tower ...

And something that connects the tower ...

And a sign ...

And there is a huge mound of earth ...

There are machnies, trucks .... the only word that I can link to it's construction.

And a sign ...

Evergreen...

What do they call this place?

EVERGREEN CEMETERY
