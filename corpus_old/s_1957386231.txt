Cancel the noise.

Listen.

Music's everywhere.

We breathe and we
swallow with the place.

Pay attention to it.

Do let it connect.

There's a pleasing
combination of elements.

They all have different
callers and different sounds.

Listen to them.

There is a deep structure.

Music aligned.

The harmony that
complements the melody.

Don't pay attention
to the noise.

That is only noise.

Concentrate your attention.

Recalibrate your mind.

Music is inside.

It resides inside of you.

Just feel it.

Just sense it.

Embrace it.

It's coming from you. It's
coming from your heart.

Music is right there.

That's what I learned from you.

Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Minton's Playhouse,

the most iconic jazz parlor
in Harlem, New York City,

the United States,
and the world.

Minton's was
established in 1938.

We are celebrating 81
years of musical legacy.

Today we have a
very special guest,

He is a great
Cuban-American singer,

so please, help me
welcome Mr. Nico Quevedo.

Thank you for that.

You know, this moment...

right here, right now...

is all we have.

It's all we are.

This night.

So let's have fun
tonight. Right?

Let's give it up for the band.

Now this song,

this one's special for me,

because I couldn't sing
this song in a while.

And as we said,
tonight is the night.

As the old ones
used to say in Cuba,

if you want your
rumba to be profound,

you have to learn how to
sing out of your own pain.

You want your rumba to be heard,

let the drums cry your sorrow.

Allow your heart
to sing your blues.

I made this song

when I learned how to
transform my pain into music.

You have
to help me on this.

I really need you.

Nico!

Nico.

Yeah.

Yeah, why not? I'll
take it to go, though.

Thank you.
Go?

Good old days, huh? Good
old days are gone, Chino.

I'll pay for it next
week. Thank you.

You're cheating on the world.

What are you talking about?

I don't get it.

I don't fucking get it!

You said you were
gonna help me on this.

You told me that.

You're full of shit.

Full of... Fuck.

I have to endure
all this by myself,

and you can't even
keep your word?

What's wrong with you?

What's the matter?

I stayed here because of you.

We had something. It
was something special.

It was real.

What do I have now?

Nothing. I have nothing.

You don't wanna talk to me.
You don't wanna listen to me.

You don't wanna pay attention
to me. You don't wanna help me.

What do you want? What
the fuck do you want?!

You want rum?

Let me get you a
little bit of rum.

You
wanna go to the beach?

Hmm?

I can take you to a
baseball game if you want.

We can have drinks.

We can go out.

We can have fun. Is
that what you want?

Huh?

What do you want? What
the fuck do you want?!

What do you want?!

You...

You're not clear with me.

There's just no
communication at all.

You don't wanna be
my friend no more?

Why?

Why are you doing
this to me? Why?

I can't sing.

I can't... write.

I can't... I cannot play
because I don't feel it.

I don't have it no more.

I don't have...

Don't take that
away from me, bro.

Don't take it away from me
because that's all I have.

That's all I have.

Don't take it away.

Don't take it away from me.

Don't take it away from me.

Don't
take it away.

Thank you.

Hey, really cool music,
Nicolas. Nicolas, is it?

Yeah. Yeah.

Man, I heard you're not
even from around here.

I was born in Jersey,
but I'm Cuban.

And what brought
you back out here?

Well, you know, oh, music.

Well, listen. You got
that music thing down.

Is it all, like, your music?

Eh.

Wrote it with my best friend.

Anyway, listen. Really,
really cool music.

I'm Bob Arenas, by the way.
Ah, Nicolas .

So which one was he in the band,

your friend in the band?

He's dead. Passed
away three months ago.

Sorry about that,
man. I-I didn't know.

What was his name?

Celso.

Celso QuiÃ±ones.

It was nice meeting you.
Um...

Hey, you know...

I'm a music manager and
producer in New York.

Check it out.

Listen, I would like to discuss
with you the possibility

of bringing you
back out there, man.

I really like what
you have, seriously,

and I think New York
is a better market...

Look, I'm... I'm not interested.

You must be the
only Cuban musician

that has no interest
in getting out of here.

Gotta go. Thank you.
Hey, Nico.

Just... Listen,
think about it.

The number in the back
is where I'm staying.

Check out the back.

If you change your
mind, hit me up.

I can help you. Trust me.

Nico!

I thought I would
never see you again.

I promised I was
gonna come back.

Yeah.

That was four years ago.

I never said when.

And I had a good teacher.

I can't believe he's gone.

Yep.

We had good
times together.

Ahh.

We wanted to change
the world with music.

We wanted to take all this...

our roots, our
background, the poetry,

and to put it out there.

I wanted to understand
who I was, and now...

I don't even know who I am.

And then... cancer.

Cancer took everything from him.

I took care of him all the
way to the end, you know.

One day...

One day we were celebrating
his last birthday,

and I sang a song
I wrote for him.

When I finished, he looked at
me in the eye and he said...

"You have to promise me.
You have to promise me that

no matter what,

you'll never stop doing this."
And I said, "I promise."

And then, his last day...

his last day,

the pain was killing him.

I didn't know...

I didn't know what to do to
relieve his pain, you know?

And I sang that song for him.

He was calm. He was...

He was... breathing.

He smiled... again.

That was the last
song I could write.

That was the last time I
could sing from my heart.

I needed this.

Me?

No.

I needed to be back home.

My life there is not
what it used to be here.

Sometimes I...

I feel out of place.

We're always gonna
feel out of place.

We're always gonna
need something

because we're immigrants.

When are you heading
back to New York?

Tomorrow.

If you ever go back,
you should call me.

I will.
Right!

Yeah, I promise I will.
Mm-hmm.

That's what you
said when I left.

You and Celso were gonna
make it to the States.

You wanted to bring all
your music to New York.

What happened to that dream?

Hey, Bob, it's me. Nicolas.

Yeah. You blew me away
with your talent, Nicolas.

No, man, you're very special.

You have something
really special, man.

Thanks.
Nah, don't thank me.

We're doing business, my friend.

Aha!

Now, see, I usually
charge my clients 50%

for management and production
and that type of thing,

but I understand your
particular situation,

so I'm willing to lower my
fee to 30% of your profits.

Thirty percent?
Off the gross, of course.

But... hey, look,

the good thing is, as soon
as you get to New York,

you'll have a job.

Huh? Isn't that somethin'?
Yeah.

Isn't it crazy how two
Americans can close on a deal

out here in this
place, out in Cuba?

Yeah. It's a new time.
Hell, yeah.

Listen, I gotta talk to
you about something else.

What's that?

I don't have a place
to stay in New York.

Say no more. You look for me.

Okay? Mi casa es
su casa, baby.

You got that right.
You got it right.

You know what I'm saying?
Right. Yes.

Huh?
Yeah, you got it right.

Excuse me, sir. There's
someone waiting for you.

I have to go, man.
I have to get out.

It's my last night, and I
got a very special date,

but I'll see you
in New York. Yes?

Yes, sir.
All right.

You're very special,
Nicolas. Don't forget it.

Looks like we're
going to New York.

Hey, can
you open the door?

Hey, are
you fucking deaf?

Answer the door.

Mom! I'm
in the bathroom.

Fuck!

This is the third time you've
been in bathroom today.

I swear you spend more time on
the toilet than anywhere else.

Hey.

What do you fucking need?
Oh! Is, uh, Bob here?

No. I haven't seen that
piece of shit in months.

What do you need him for?
Well... I'm... My name is Nico.

And Bob and I met a
few months ago in Cuba.

He offered me a contract
to come and work with him.

I'm sorry. Did you say Cuba?
Yeah.

Yeah, Cuba. I was...
I was living in Cuba,

and he saw me perform in the
streets when he approached me.

In Cuba?
Yes, in Cuba.

Yeah. When was this?

Well, as I said,
a few months ago.

Fuck. I told you your
father was a piece of shit!

What?

He was supposed to be
at a spiritual retreat,

trying to find himself, and
you're telling me he was

messing around with
you, blowing lines

and banging whores in Cuba,
you fucking piece of garbage!

What? Mom, who's that?

Oh! There's some fucking
animal here that says

he's been with your father
in Cuba a few months ago

when your fucking father
was supposed to be in Ohio,

saving his fucking soul.
What are you talking about?

He's been fucking whoring
around behind my back?

Again?

Seriously?!

Again?

You know, he told me after
Colombia he wouldn't do it,

but here we are. You
fucking piece of cocksucker!

I-I-I...
Don't talk to me, you pervert.

You were what, making a
mockery of me with him?

No. I...
Down in Cuba, having a party.

Now you're coming to my house.
What, you wanna do it here?

No, I'm just a musician.
Stop!

I'ma musician.

He was supposed
to be my manager,

and look where that got me.

He can't even
manage his own life.

How's he supposed
to manage your life?

My family won't even look
at me after being with him.

So let me do you a favor.

If you don't want
me to fuck you up,

get the fuck outta
here right now!

Get the fuck out!
Fucking monkey!

I'm gonna throw your
dirty ass down the stairs!

How dare you come to my house?!

If I ever see your face again,
I'm gonna call the fucking cops!

If you're lucky.

Here's your water. No ice.

Thank you.

Temerario Restaurant.

Hi, I'm
looking for Telmaris.

Is she there?
Who is this?

This is Nico. I'm
her friend from Cuba.

I am sorry, but
we're not allowed

to take personal
calls while we work.

I know. I know. I know.

It's just that this
is really important.

Let me see what I
can do. Hold on.

What's happening?

Uh, it's that guy that only
Telmaris can understand.

He wants to place an order.

That one?
Yeah, that's amazing.

It comes with the ice. Uh...
It's a guy from Cuba. Nico.

He wants to talk to you. He
says it's kind of urgent.

I'll be back in a minute.
Okay.

This is
today's special.

Is everything good?
Good.

Hello?
Hey.

I promised I'd call you as
soon as I get to New York.

Nico.

This is Celso.

What do you mean, this is Celso?

Yeah.

I... kept his ashes.

What?

Look.

I use four seashells to
communicate with him.

So if I throw 'em,
and the four of them,

they land facing
down, that means no.

If they face up, that means yes.

If I have three of them
facing down, one down...

You out of your mind?
No, no, no. This is serious.

I can talk to him.

And everything makes sense now

because he's not
really happy lately.

We went back. You came to Cuba.

You mentioned his dream.

I realized that this is
exactly what he wanted.

He always wanted to
be here in New York.

He wanted to be closer to you.

I'm not going to...

This is the completion
of his dream, Telmaris.

Stop, Nico. This is insane.
This is not insane.

He's dead.
I'm just trying to explain...

Is everything okay?
Yeah.

Need some more coffee?
No. Just the check.

Ah. Okay.
Thanks.

He's dead.
No, he's not.

He's gone.
He's not.

He was your best friend,

and what you guys lived
together was incredible,

but you have to realize that
he's no longer with you.

What I had with
him was beautiful.

It's in the past.
It was over many...

He wanted you back in his life.
What are you talking about?

You and I had sex
only a few months ago,

and now you're
telling me all this?

What you're doing
to yourself is sick.

What you're doing to
him is disrespectful.

Telmaris. Listen. Telmaris!

Here's the check.

Hi, Norman. I'm back.

How'd it go?

It wasn't what I expected.

Guys are fucking retarded.

The only head they
have is their dick.

Speaking of dickheads...

Thought you were
gonna be gone an hour.

It's barely 30 minutes.

Yeah.

What kind of emergency is that?

Never mind. It's all good now.

I can't stand him.
I know.

You can quit anytime.

I can't. I have to
send money to my mom.

She's taking care of my kid.

But you're by yourself.
It's better that way.

The minute you don't have
someone depending on you,

there is no freedom
in this place.

That's all bullshit.

When I came to this country,
I wanted to build my dreams.

I wanted to become an
actress, and look at me.

Six years later, I keep
on doing this shit.

We come here to become
slaves, to work our asses off

so someone else has
that freedom we pursue.

But if I think of my
four-year-old back home smiling,

maybe it's worth this crap.

What's going on, ladies?

What is this, social
club? Get to work.

Cancel the noise.

Listen.

We breathe and we
swallow with the place.

Pay attention to it.

Do let it connect.

Don't pay attention
to the noise.

That is only noise.

Concentrate your attention.

Recalibrate your mind.

Music is inside.

It resides inside of you.

Just feel it.

Just sense it.

Embrace it.

It's coming from you.

Coming from your heart ticking.

Well, this is it.

The Big Apple.

The place you always
wanted to come and see.

It's a nice view,
isn't it? Huh?

What do you think?

Big Apple.

Is it really that big of a city?

Not really.

Man, think about it.
It's just an island.

Just like Cuba.

Isn't that paradoxical?
What?

You and me, we come
from similar places.

Isolated, surrounded by water,

and very different
backgrounds.

Different conditions.

One of us is dying,

and the other one is
full of commitments.

Dreams.

You talking about
Cuba and New York,

or are you... you're
talking about you and me?

It's the same.

All right.

I would have loved to
have seen Manhattan.

We can still go.

When? I have two weeks.

Maximum.
Listen, don't...

Don't believe everything...
I know, I'm not.

I know. I know what's
going to happen.

I'm not blind.

I would have loved to
have seen my father,

look him in the eyes...

tell him that he
was my inspiration

for being in the music.

My mama always said
he was a unique man.

You think he will
have that jazz place?

I prefer to believe what
my mom used to say...

but at least for
the next two weeks.

Come on.

Look, I wanna tell you,
that thing with Telmaris,

I didn't plan it. It
just happened, you know?

Shut the fuck up!

What is the matter with you?

Can't you see there are
people sleeping around here?

You wanna practice
your fucking monologue,

go someplace else, Shakespeare.

Sorry. I was just
having a conversation.

With who? With your penis?
No. I was talking...

Never mind.

What the fuck are you doing
sitting in my spot, in my park?!

Your spot? Your park?

I didn't know this
is private property.

Get the fuck out of my park!
Listen, buddy...

I'm not your buddy.
Well, listen...

I'm also homeless, okay?

Oh, yeah?

Well, go find your own park.
This is a public park.

You're not gonna kick me out.

Fuck you! Get out of my park!
What's the matter with you?

You have your spot right there.
Fuck you! Get out of my park!

Okay, that's fine.
I'm moving on.

Get the fuck outta my spot!
Okay!

Okay. I'm moving
to that one. Okay?

Is that gonna make you happy?

Freaking asshole.

What did you say?
Nothing.

If I see you back on my spot or
I hear your snoring at night,

I'll beat the shit outta you!

 Fuck me.
I heard that!

Damn it!

Sick and
tired of fucking bums,

invading my goddamn park.

Every single night,
the same thing.

Every fucking park,

invaded by bums
and useless scum!

Not one night...

Fuck!

Sorry.

Shit.

Hey! Hey!

Hey, I'm talking to
you! Where you going?

Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey!

Hey! Hey!

Hey! Stop! Stop!

Hey!

Hey! Hey!

Hey! Stop! Stop!

I swear!
What?

I swear if you come any closer,

I'll stab the shit out of you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

I wanna get my stuff.
I warned you yesterday,

and you didn't listen.
I told you not to snore!

What?
Yesterday I said don't snore,

or there will be consequences,
but you little piece of shit...

Wait, wait. I'm
sorry that my snoring

is louder than the
city, okay? I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to intrude.
Look, just let me get my stuff.

I'm gonna walk away,
and you will never

hear my snoring ever again.
You stole my place,

I have the right
to steal from you.

That's how it works!
A tooth for a tooth!

I didn't steal from you.

Wait, wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

Look, you said
it. You said it.

A tooth for a tooth. I took your
place for a couple of hours.

You took my stuff for
a couple of hours.

We're even now.
It doesn't work that way.

You know, I am Prince
Roman from Asturias!

No motherfucker can dare
come and take my place!

Okay! Okay!

Okay, Prince Roman from
whatever the place...

Athurius.

I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm sorry.

Look...

Look, here's the deal. You
can take everything I have.

It belongs to you now.
Just give me Celso.

What?
The handkerchief!

A fucking handkerchief!

The handkerchief I
have in my backpack.

Ha ha! The fucking backpack!
I don't have it anymore.

What do you mean?
Sold it!

What do you mean, sold
it? Sold it to who?

Some fucking bum needed it
to move to the East Side.

It's a good thing he's gone.

I hate these fucking
homeless invading my park!

Well, what's his name?
Where can I find him?

He's a bum!

I know he's a fucking bum!
I know that! I need more.

He wears a Yankees cap
all the time. That's it.

Get the fuck outta here!

And don't let me see you
back in my park again.

And if I hear you snoring at
night, there'll be consequences.

Freaking weirdo!

Sir?

Can I have a chat with you?

Excuse me. Can I have a
conversation with you?

Sir? Sir?

Hey? Hello!

Can I have a-a...

Can I have a conversation
with you for a second?

I-I don't want to
bother you, sir.

Sir, can I have a chat with you?

Look, it's really
gonna be quick.

I just need to know,

did you buy a backpack from
a homeless guy this morning?

Why would I buy a backpack
from a homeless person?

I don't know. The only
reason why I'm asking this

is because the homeless
guy told me that he sold it

to another homeless guy...
I look like a homeless person?

No. No, no. I didn't mean
to say that. I just...

All I'm saying is that...

He told me that he sold it
to this trashy person...

This trashy person?

Look, buddy, I ain't got
what you want, all right?

I didn't buy a backpack.
I'm sorry.

Forget about it.
I didn't mean to insult...

Sir!

Hey, pops. What's shaking?

You know, um...

Look, um...

I'm looking for
a friend of mine.

He's my bro.

He has a backpack that
he's trying to sell.

I have some gas. I
have some cash on me.

I wanna give it to him.
You probably know him

because he's always
wearing this Yankees cap.

Nice ass, pal.

Well, just give us the cash,
and we'll get it to him.

It doesn't work
like that, you know.

I gotta find him.

I thought you said
he was your bro?

Yeah. Yeah, he is my bro.

He's my brother, you
know. He's my pal.

He's actually waiting for me.

I know the guy.

You do?

I blow him whenever he has a
few bucks and a clean penis.

What's in it for me
if I take you to him?

Five bucks.

Piece of shit.
Pendejo.

Five bucks won't
even buy us a beer,

and I stopped drinking
cheap a while ago.

Ten, but that's gonna be it.

You gotta get serious.

Nah! Go 20, and we
may have a deal.

Top it off with ten,
I'll throw in a blow job.

No, thank you.
You're the monster.

Tony!
Charles, he's a number 12.

He's here to fuck
you in the ass.

Sir, I'm sorry. I don't
know what's going on here,

but do we have a deal?

I'll give you money, give you 20
but you have to take me to him.

Hell, no. Can't you
see I'm playing chess?

Just give me the 20, and I'll
tell you where he hangs out.

He hangs out over there,

and we all call
him Prince Armand.

Hey! That's mine.

Stop right there,
okay! That's mine.

Stop right there!
Just give me that!

Hey!
Just give me my bag.

Come on! Gimme
that! Gimme that!

That's all I need.
Just gimme that...

It's what you want?
Yes. Gimme Celso.

You don't get it.
That's my friend!

That's my friend.
Give it to me.

What, are you fucking crazy?
It's a fucking rag, man.

No, it is not a rag! That's my
friend. You don't understand.

Just give it to me, okay?
Fuck you.

Fuck your rag, too.
No, no, no!

Don't come here no more,
you or your rag, okay?

There'll be big trouble.
Big fucking trouble.

Yes.

Bravo.

It seems you've got
something special.

Let's hope we hit
the mark tonight

like we did in the rehearsal.

Well, Jim. We always do.

Well, I'm not
concerned about you.

That music is something special.

Yeah, yeah.

Sorry, we're not open yet.

Hey, Joe. Get me another
shot of rum, please.

You got it, boss.
Thank you.

Somebody told me once that
when you play it right,

the music really
turns into magic...

We're closed.
Nah, it's okay.

You're not aware of the
instrument that you're playing

or the notes that
you're singing...

because you're just
another instrument.

A channel...

to bring it down to earth.

That is what music is
all about. Nothing else.

I wish everybody knew...
Endowment is not for everybody.

That is true.

They always play
Latin jazz here?

Mondays and Saturdays.

Mondays and Saturdays.
Mm-hmm.

It's a good thing I come back
to see them Saturday, then.

Where you from?

Cuba.

Cuba.

Nice.

I had a great time in
Havana, a long time ago.

You did?

Yeah. Yep.

I went down there
for a music program.

Spent a couple of months,

and had the, uh, full
Cuban experience.

You know, food, music, people.

Man, I love that place.

But reality hit, and here I am.

When did you get here?

Like, 24 hours ago.

Twenty-four hours ago?

You're still fresh.

Yes.
Joe, give my friend...

Nico.

Give my friend Nico a shot.

Rum?
Rum is always good.

Come on.

Come on. It's on the
house. It's okay.

Thank you.

Thanks.
Okay.

Cheers.

Salut.

So, Nico...

what brings you back?

This place.

Somebody told me about
this place a few years ago.

I always wanted to come
and see it by myself.

Interesting...

how life gives you what you need
at the right time you need it.

I remember when I was a kid...

my father used to play sax
right here in this place.

I'd run out from the house
in the middle of the night

and stand right there,

by the bar entrance
and watch him play.

I can assume clearly because
the place was packed,

but, oh, I could hear
him play that sax, man.

That was magic to my ears.

Those nights...

after watching him
play for two hours...

I ran back home
after his last solo,

and... I got home and...

later on I didn't hear the door
slam behind him like usual.

Never came back home.

That was the last
time I saw him.

You never heard from him?

No. Never again.

But the Blue Bird was
always on my mind.

I wanted to be a musician,
but I didn't have the skills,

didn't have the endowment.

But, man, did I have the
skills to make money.

That's what I did. I
made a lot of money,

and bought this place.

How did you get that flyer?

My friend, Celso.

He gave it to me.

Celso?

Yeah.
That's a strange name.

How'd he get it?
His mom.

Hmm.

So I printed these
flyers back in '82.

After I acquired the place,

I took some of these
down to the island.

You know, do a little
advertising, stuff like that.

Matter of fact, I was
planning to hire some locals,

great musicians, come back
here, but it was the '80s, so...

It's a cool thing that
your friend kept this.

He like jazz?
He loves jazz.

That makes sense.

As a matter of fact, he's so...

well...

He was... a great composer.

Really? What kinda music?

Rumba Cubana.

Yeah, Rumba Cubana.

I love Rumba Cubana.

Yes, I know.

You do?

I do... know a lot
of things about you.

I didn't think I
was that famous.

See my friend, Celso...

he always wanted to
come here to New York,

He was fascinated, he was
mesmerized, he was obsessed

with the idea of the Blue Bird.

He passed away a few months ago.

Yeah.

Sorry to hear that.

You know what's interesting?
This place, the Blue Bird,

was the only connection
that he had with his father.

He went away without
even knowing about him.

It was this flyer right here...

the only thing he
ever got from his dad.

You gave this flyer to Mercedes,

the beautiful woman you
met and fell in love with,

when you went to Cuba.

This flyer...

was the only thing that
Celso got to see from you.

You had a son in Cuba.

But you never came back.

Never came back.

And all those years,
Mercedes only hoped

that one day you would
come back to see your son.

Almost a year and a half ago...

Celso got cancer, and she died.

I always knew what
his biggest dream was,

that's why I'm here.

This...

is Celso's ashes.

This is your son.

It's time for you to leave.

Leave.

Get the fuck outta here!

Is everything okay, Jim?

It's fine. It's fine. Fine.

My friend Nico
is... is leaving.

Take that with you.

Hey, shithead.

Don't even think about
sitting on that bench

for one more second.

Now I gave you your
fucking do-rag.

Now I don't wanna
see you in my park,

or these guys are
gonna break your face.

Look, brother, I'm not...
Do I look like you?

I ain't your brother.

We ain't family.

So I don't wanna
see you in my park.

You understand? I
run these parks.

I own these benches, and if
you ain't paying me rent,

I don't wanna see
your face here.

You understand me?
I do. Yeah.

I'm leaving right now, okay?

I'm leaving.

I'm leaving. Just leave
me right now. I'm leaving.

Leaving. Easy.

We're cool. Right?

Are we?
We're not cool.

We're cool. I mean,
I'm leaving right now.

It's your park. The bench.

That's fine.

Did you tell her what I
told you to tell her last week?

Yes, but she's incapable
of straightening out things

on her calendar.

We have been planning this
trip to Portugal forever.

Last time we talked about it

we both agreed on staying at
Lisboa just for three days.

And then the plan was driving.

Now she's afraid to drive
because she's afraid

of her insurance
working in Europe.

Who cares?

What's up with this guy?

Well, do something!
Tell someone.

Yeah.

Sorry, but you gotta leave.

Yeah, man. Sorry about that.

Hold on.

How's your coffee?
Good.

Okay. Milk?
Yes.

You got a call.

Hello?

I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm hungry and I'm homeless.

Meet me at the same
place in 15 minutes.

I gotta go.

Where is Lewis?

He's in the kitchen.
Tell him that I have to go.

It's an emergency.
Again?

I have to do this.

He won't let you come back this
time. You know that, don't you?

I know, but I really
have to do this.

Go.

Thanks.

Hey, what'd you think?

Are you trying to connect
spiritually with rum?

You don't have anyone
else to connect to,

rum becomes the best company.

Can I sit and talk to you,

so you have someone else to
connect with besides the bottle?

I wanted to...

I wanted to thank you
for what you did for me.

What did I do?
Well...

You know, my tuition.
Tuition? What tuition?

You covered my semester's
tuition at the university.

They called me from the office,
Jim. They said you covered it.

Well...

Somebody made a mistake.
Why?

Why do you do that?

I mean, I am so thankful
for what you did for me.

But why did you help me?

Why do you help everybody?

You know, everybody
tells stories about you

helping them out with something,

paying for something
without them asking or...

just giving, giving without
being even asked for it.

Why did you help me? Why
do you help everybody?

I should help.

I need to help.
It's an obligation.

But why?
Because I can.

And because I got
nothing else to do.

And probably because you
have no one else to help.

I'm sorry.

Can I ask you something? Who
was the guy from yesterday?

You've been acting
weird ever since.

Stop. Just a kid
looking for a job.

And you didn't help him?

It's complicated.

He brought back
memories that, uh...

Bad memories?

No.

Matter of fact, they were...

They were good memories.

Probably the best
memories I've ever had,

and that's why I
reacted the way I did.

Yeah. I had lost something,
and I didn't notice it, and...

I'm trying to bury the past,
and he just brought it back.

That's... buried now.

And you don't want
to see those memories

you enjoyed so much, again?
No.

No.

Why?

It's too late.

No, Jim.

It's never too late. Trust me.

As long as we're here,

it's never too late to reconnect
with your happiest memories.

It's okay to make
yourself happy, too,

to give to yourself the
way you give to others.

Why didn't you call me before?

I didn't want to bother.

You don't bother me.

Thanks for the food.

Seriously?

Can I take your plate?

Yes. Yes.

I want to talk to you
about, you know, us.

Nico, don't.

Just forget everything.

You can't do anything to
bring him back, right?

You can do something
for yourself

and make him feel proud of you.

After that night with you
in Cuba, I felt guilty.

But then I thought about him,
and I remember how he was.

And I know that if he
would have been watching us

from some faraway place,

he would have felt happy
that I was with you.

Let me take you home.
No. No.

Nico. Look at me.

You're homeless.

You gotta take a
shower. You gotta eat.

You gotta sleep in a warm place.

You have to move on.

You have to change, Nico.
I gotta finish first.

Then I'll change.

Twenty five.
Twenty five? That's bad.

How about white?
Uh, 30.

Thirty? Cases of beer?

Fifteen, but I think
we started out with 20.

Then Mikey was telling me...
Shh. Hold on a second.

Keep counting. Give
me a total, okay?

You got it.

Thanks, shithead.
Hey! Hey!

You don't listen, do you?
Just gimme that!

What's with you and
this stupid rag anyway?

Hey, that's him!

Crazy motherfucker,
who two days ago

assaulted me after
he invaded my park!

What'd you do to my lady?
I didn't do anything to her.

Hold it.
No, no, no.

Hey! Shut up.

You don't belong here.
He's a monster, a number 12.

You have to pay the price

if you don't respect
our community.

We have rules to follow here.

Can't just invade our space.
I'm not invading your space.

We gave you a few
chances already.

You just ignored
us, blew us off.

I wonder what this crazy...
No!

Hey! Hey.

Stop that now!
Who the fuck are you?

Hey, Jim.
Charles, don't do that.

Hey, Jim. He...

We're just teaching
this guy a lesson. He...

He doesn't follow the rules.

Rules?

What the hell you
talking about, Prince?

Um, our rules. He's an intruder.

He is enemy.
No, he's not.

He's my son.

Your son?

I didn't know you had a son.

But he doesn't look
anything like you.

Do you resemble your mama?
Hey! Hey!

Take it easy, Jim.
We were trying...

No, I'm not gonna
take it easy, Prince.

I feed you guys and
make everything possible

so you have a place to stay.

I give you money,
I give you clothes,

and this is the way
you treat my family?

So no, I'm not
gonna take it easy.

Give it to me.

I... I'm sorry, Jim.
We... We... We're sorry.

Yeah.

Just don't let it happen again.

It won't. It won't happen again.

Here.

Let's go. Everybody, let's go.

Thank you.

You need a shower. You stink.

I'm sorry.

Don't be sorry. It's okay.

Yeah.

Come on. Come with me.

Come on. Let's go.

I see my clothes fit you.
Yeah.

Sit down. Dinner's ready.

Okay?

When was the last time
you had a decent hot meal?

I don't remember.

Look, I wanna thank
you for everything.

That song...

the one you were
singing in the park...

where'd you learn that?

He told me it was his
mom's favorite song.

He said that she used to sing
that song for him every night

to make him go to sleep.

When did you guys meet?

About six years ago
when I moved to Cuba.

I wanted to learn all about
my roots and my background,

plus my father.

My father wanted me
to learn Rumba Cubana,

but I knew I'm not
gonna get that here.

Where's your father now?

He's also in heaven.

I'm sorry.

Go ahead. Eat now.

You guys have the
same personality.

I mean, you and my dad.

When I saw you the other day...

it was just like looking at him.

Eat. It's getting cold.

Do you have a place to stay?
Not really.

I mean, I know somebody.

Hmm. But it's complicated.

A girl.
Yeah.

With them, it's
always complicated.

Do you love her?

It's very complicated.

I understand.

If you love her...

you go and get her.

Don't be a pussy.

You can't change the past...

but you can change the
present and the future.

Don't make the same
mistake I made.

You...

You got out and get her.

In the meantime you can stay
here. You can crash here.

You sure?

Of course.
What about him?

He's gonna be okay now.

Besides, he's probably tired

of you getting him
lost in the city.

You know, I always
imagined this moment.

I always knew...

that one day...

I would have a shot
of rum with my son...

and talk about life.

I never thought it
would be like this.

I...

I've been waiting for this
moment for a long time.

I've even imagined

every single piece
of you in my head.

Your face...

your eyes...

your hair...

even your habits,

your words.

I knew you would come
back because I...

I never had the
courage to go meet you.

I knew all about you.

Yeah.

Your mother used to call
me at first and tell me.

She called me to tell
about your illness.

Your mother is a wonderful
woman, and you know that.

Your mother...

was the love of
my life, and I...

never had the strength or...

or balls to go back
to her and to you.

I...

I'd send the money every year.

And in my stupid mind, I thought
I was doing the right thing.

I was doing...

the same thing my
father did to me

when he left and
never came back home.

I...

I...

I'd love to see
you alive, but...

I never did.

And I am a fucking selfish,

full of shit coward.

And I am so sorry.

I...

I'm so sorry.

I... You...

you did...

teach me a great lesson.

You taught me, and
you taught Nico there,

you should never give up.

Because you came all
the way over here...

to teach me that lesson.

And here we are.

It's never too late...

to love someone.

I will always love you, son.

Our children come into
this world with a mission,

and that mission is to teach us.

It's time to let go.

You made his dreams come true.

Now it's time to let go.
