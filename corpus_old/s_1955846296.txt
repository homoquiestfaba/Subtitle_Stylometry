<i>Hey, Mike,</i>

<i>it's Jeff Nida from...</i>
<i>Who?</i>

<i>It's Jeff Nida...</i>
<i>What?</i>

<i>It's Jeff from</i>
<i>Nida Investigation.</i>

Oh hey, Jeff, sorry, hey.

<i>Did you get the package?</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, the package.</i>

Yeah, yeah, I got it.
<i>You wanna keep digging?</i>

(STATIC ON PHONE)

What?
<i>I mean keep looking.</i>

Oh, no, no,
I don't think so.

No, maybe, I don't know.

She's already
pissed off enough
as it is.

<i>Yeah, well...</i>
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what she expects.</i>

We've been married
for 20 years

and I have no idea
where she came from,

who her family is
and how she even got here,

and I got two daughters
who want to know
their heritage.

What am I supposed
to do, Jeff?

<i>we keep looking until</i>

Hello?
<i>I say we keep looking.</i>

Hello?
<i>Call me back</i>

(CALL DROPS)
Ah, shit.

(SOFT PIANO MUSIC)

(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

Yeah, I will.

Hey! I want you home
early tonight.

I gotta
work tomorrow.
Okay.

And no drinking.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Ow, Mom,
you're pulling.
Ooh.

Sit still.

All right,
there you go.
Ah, thanks.

Finish up.

Dad's outside.
Oh, good,

he's been gone all...

Have you decided
what you're going
to wear tonight?

Mmm. I was thinking,
I don't know,
boots and a dress?

A long dress?

Yeah, you know, like...

This long?

No, no, no,
that won't work.


Something a little more
conservative.

Okay, Mom.
Okay, okay, all right.

Well, have fun, okay?

I love you.
I love you.

Be good.
I will.

Your dad's worried
about you.

You guys don't need
to worry about anything.

Hey, that's our job,
we're parents.

Yeah.

Thinking about
getting ready?

RACHEL: That's what
I'm doing.

Hey, beautiful.
Hi.

How was your day?
It was good, how...

...was yours?

(SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

(KNOCKS ON DOOR)
MICHAEL: Hey,
what are you doing?

Dad, I'll be
right down.

MICHAEL: Matt's waiting.

Talk to your sister?

Uh. Yeah, she's gonna
drop me off at Beth's,
so, yeah, we're covered.

Cool.

So you'll just give me
a call tomorrow

and, uh, we'll come pick you
up when you're ready?
Okay.

Okay.

What's that?

It came.

You got it?

Jonesboro PD let it go.

I had them send it out.


Well, I had to forge
a few things
here and there.

Yep.

Well, did you open it?
What's in it?

Was Mom in prison
or something?
I don't know.

I don't think so.

Let's go find out.

All right, let's see
what we got. (SIGHS)

ANNA: I can't believe
you found something.

MICHAEL: I know,
it was just dumb luck.

Whoa, what's this?
I don't know.

ANNA: It's kind of heavy.

MICHAEL: They look like
research notes of some kind.

Huh.

Here's the date, 1988.

And a name on top,
John Mallen.

Maybe your grandparents
were archeologists
or something. (CHUCKLES)

John Mallen.

These look like dig notes
of some sort

from a trip to an old
Russian mine or something.

Maybe they found some ancient,
but high-tech artifacts?

These look like springs.

MICHAEL: They do
look like springs.

ANNA: "We've uncovered
an astonishing collection

"of metal artifacts
dating between
20,000 to 300,000 BC."

MICHAEL: What kind
of estimate is that?

(IN MOCKING DEEP VOICE)
Look, I've carbon-dated
this piece of metal

and it's anywhere
from five days
to five trillion years old.

It's a bunch of bull.

You don't
carbon date metal.

How long you been
standing there?

The point is
I don't think
there should be metal

that's been machined
that's even 20,000 years old.

Yeah, I got that part.
(CLEARS THROAT)

ANNA: See how it twists?

Look at this.
RACHEL: Hey, Anna,
we gotta go.

No, wait, you gotta
see this, it's crazy.

Matt's waiting.

Anna, I'm serious.

You go ahead,
I'll get this all organized

and we'll go over it
in the morning, okay?

Don't tell Mom.

You have to wait for me,
promise me you'll wait.
I promise.

She's not gonna
like that.

MICHAEL: Who asked you?
Oh, okay.

You know, we don't know
everything about
your mom, Rachel,

and I think I have
a right to know, okay?

Okay.

Sorry, Dad,
please call me
if you find anything.

This is awesome.
I will.

You be safe.
I will. I love you.

I love you, too.

No drinking.

Yes, sir.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

Mom's coming.

Oh, shit.

Hey.
What are you up to?

Oh, nothing.
Oh, really?

Really. Yeah, I was just
going to, uh, change
and get something to eat.

Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

Well, I'm gonna
go take a shower.

Okay, take a shower?
Yeah.

By myself.

By yourself.
Yeah.

All right.

You want me to pull over?

Are you sure?

'Cause if you throw up

your dad's gonna kill me.

And if you throw up on my car,
I'm going to kill you.

(IN OTHER ROOM)
No, not really.

She still can't remember
anything about that night,

I wish she would
just tell me what happened.

Seriously, why won't you
just tell me?

No.

Not after
what Dad did to us.

She won't talk to him.

I don't know
that she ever will.

We'll see.

You know how she is.

I don't...
I don't know.

Listen, I gotta go, okay?

Bye.

Who was that?

Who called?

So, where were you
last night?

Okay, so it's not
someone from school

or you would just tell me.

You weren't at work
because I called.

And it can't be Dad
because he doesn't call us.

Ray...
So who does that leave?

You know who it was.

Listen, he can't
get a hold of his parents
and he's worried.

Hey.

He got out, you know?

Today.

He got out this morning.

What?

He's on his way home.

It's only been
a couple of years.

You know, I think
we should go home.

He got five years,
it's only been a couple.

You know,
we've waited too long.

We have to go back.
Why didn't you tell me?

You know, that night,
Dad found something.

It was this piece of metal,

and it was really old
and weird,

and, you know, I think
it has to be important.

Did you call him
or did he call you?

Are you even
listening to me?

You should've
told me, Anna.

We have to go home.

Let's go home.
This time we'll stay

until we get
some answers, okay?

And maybe it will
help you remember,

but we have to go back.

I'm not going
back there again.

Well, I'm not
giving up on Dad,

not after everything
we've been through.

It's a three-hour drive.
I don't care. I'll drive.

I want to go home, Ray.

This is our home now.

Get used to it.

Why was she beat up, Dad?

Did you hit Mom?

Did you hit her?

Did you hit her?

What did you do?

What did you do to Mom?

Why do you have that?

Why do you have it?

Give it to me!


I want you here?

Dad, what are you doing?

Why are you doing this?

We are not
going anywhere.

You think I want you here
after what you did?

Me? I didn't do anything.

Matt did this.
I didn't do anything.

Get out of my house.

No, Dad, please,
please, please, please.

I need you, I need you,
I can't do this alone, Dad.

Get out of my house!

No, I won't.

If you come back here,
I will kill you.

What?

Get out of my fucking house!

(BROODING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

Hello?

Dad?

(ANNA GASPS)

ANNA: (IN DISTANCE) Ray!

Anna.

Hey, you.


MATT: You know,
I think you got
something dead in there.

Cats probably got
a rat or something.
Yeah, maybe.

Hey.

ANNA: Hey, what were you
doing in there anyway?

I hate that place.
Took a shortcut

through the field.
Hey, Ray, hold on a second.

Rachel, come on, please.
Just stop for a second.

I need to talk to you.

Don't touch me.

Okay, I just need
to find your dad, okay?

Then I'll be gone.
I won't ever come back

if that's what you want,
I promise.

But Rachel,
there's some seriously
weird shit going on.

Ray.

Rachel?
Your parents,
are they okay?

Did something happen?
I don't know, honestly.

They weren't there.
The place was a mess.

There were these weird
like half-full milk cartons
all over the place.

Oh, yeah, we found
a bunch in the kitchen,

but they were just empty
with the tops cut off.

Really?
Yeah.

I... I don't know.

We haven't found
Dad yet though.

His pickup's here,

but I thought maybe
he's in the field
or the barn, or something.

Okay, do you mind
if I stay?

I can maybe
help you guys look.

Yeah, of course, please.

I'm so happy to see you.
Yeah, me too.

Well, now we know
where it's made.

Dad's making it?

It looks pretty fresh.

What is he doing
with this stuff?

RACHEL: I don't know.

I mean, it could be
pig's food, but...

Looks like he might have made
this batch a couple days ago.

So he's here?

I don't know.

You guys got power?
I haven't seen
any lights on.

I don't think so.
There wasn't anything on
in the house.

Okay, I think I'm gonna go
check out the generator.

It should've kicked on
if the power turned off.

(BROODING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

(GENERATOR CRANKING)


Is that blood?

(GENERATOR RATTLING TO LIFE)

There's enough gas
for a couple of hours,

but that's about it.
ANNA: We found some blood.

That's not good.

Jeez, your dad's been busy.

Hey, look at the pictures.

What is that?

Looks kind of like
a cigarette burn.

Guys, it's on all of them.

Oh, my God,
is that a knife?

Oh, shit.

Oh, my God, Dad.

Hey, hey, it's okay,
I'm sure he's fine.

No, no,
we have to find him.

What if he's hurt? What...

There's no one here
to help him.
He's all alone.

I know.
We'll find him, okay?

We should probably
call 911.

Yeah, I'll do it.

MATT: Okay,
call the clinic, too,
just in case.

Okay.

Rachel, I don't think
you guys should
stay here tonight.

It's not safe.
I'm not going anywhere.

Let's just head back
to the city.

You know, we can
come back tomorrow
once we've gotten some help.

I'm staying here,
I need some answers.

MATT: Well, at least
let me help you.

You've done enough.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

Rachel.

Help.

(SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

Hey, Rachel, hang on.

Rachel, will you
talk to me? Please?

Do you ever ask yourself
why you can't remember?

What?
That night,

don't you wonder
why you can't remember
what happened?

This is not about that.
Yes, it's all about that.

No, it's not, it's about
you and your problems

and all the bullshit
around what you think
happened that night.

Everything that followed
is on you, so just stop.

That's not true, okay?
And you know it.
I paid the price.

We all paid the price
for it, you selfish prick.

You destroyed everything.
You don't fix that.

You don't take it back.

I know
it wasn't your fault.

Okay? It was an accident.
Just get away from me.

Ray, no one could have
stopped in time.

No one.

You left me alone
with nothing.

I would never leave you.

Babe, never.

You know why
I had to go away.

You know. It's not
a big mystery that
needs to be solved.

You already know.
Just... Just leave me
alone please.

Ray, hey, Ray.

Look, we all suffer,
all right?

Some more than others,
but how you're feeling
right now,

it's only temporary.

Okay? As soon
as you realize that,
everything will be okay,

because there's people
that love you
and will do anything for you,

then you can start
to move on
and live your life.

It was an accident, Ray.

Please stop.

Don't do this.

Ray.

Ray.
Fuck off.

Hey, the phone's dead.

Okay, um...

I think I'm gonna try
to go out and get a signal.

Okay, do you want me
to go with you?
No.

No, no. Stay here
and keep an eye
on Rachel,

and look out
for your dad.
Okay.

Do you mind
if I take the car?

Yeah sure,
the keys are in it.
Okay, great.

Oh, hey.
Yeah?

You know that metal thing
that you talked about
on the phone?

I think Rachel has it.
What?

Yeah, she's got that
and some other stuff.

Really?

I'm here. Everything's
going to be okay.

Dad?
RACHEL:
You didn't tell me.

Why didn't you tell me?

I'm sorry. I tried.
I didn't know how.

I tried.

I tried.
I didn't know how.

I'm so sorry.

(SOMBER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

Why did you do it?

Because I love you,
Rachel.

I love you.

I think my mom
changed her name.

What?

I think her whole family
was murdered.

How do you know that?

(BULBS CLINKING)

Oh, shit.
We're gonna lose it.

Lose what?

Rachel.

Hey.

THE HOLLOW ONE:
(OVERLAPPING WITH LINDA)

There's something
wrong with them.
So? We can help him.

(METAL THUDS)

Why did he do that, why?

MATT: Are you okay?

Come on, we gotta
get out of here. Come on.

ANNA: (CRYING) I can't...
I can't leave him. Sorry.


Anna, I'm really sorry,
but we can't stay here,
okay?

Come on, we gotta go find
your sister, come on.


Rachel!

Anna?

She's headed for
the barn, come on.

What are you doing?

There are these
symbols on the device

and it looks
like they line up

and it has to mean something.

Anna, we don't have
time for this, come on.

ANNA:
I think it fits
in this thing.

Anna, we don't even know
what this thing is, okay?

It could be a whistle
or a fucking bomb.

No, this is important.

Then let's bring it with us,
but Rachel needs our help.

Come on, come on, come on.

THE HOLLOW ONE:
(OVERLAPPING WITH LINDA)
<i>He's waiting for you.</i>

Okay, you gotta listen to me.

If I'm not back in
five minutes, you leave.
Do you understand me?

You go and you get help
and you bring it back.

No, I wanna come with you.

in the best shape, okay?

I can't take care of
you and your sister.

I can take care of myself.

I know you can,

but somebody's gotta
bring back help, okay?

You can do this.

Wait here.

Anna, lock the door,
lock it.

Look at me.

Hey, I don't know
what you're hearing
or what you're seeing,

but it's not real, okay?

It's a lie.
Look at me.

It's me. It's Matt.
I'm real.

Focus on me,
I'm right here.

Please remember,
Rachel, I need you
to come back, please.

Please, I need you

Matt?

Yeah.

What am I doing here?

I don't know, babe,
you just came out here.

Look, hey, I need
you to look at this.

Do you know what this is?

Come on, babe, think.

It fits on the top,
that's what she said.

Fits on the top...

Okay.

So, what's this
supposed to do?

Matt.
All right.

Behind you.

You need to take this, Anna.

Okay, here.

This too.


(FOREBODING MUSIC)

If you will not help me,

then all will suffer.



Matt!

Shit.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

Hey!

Is this what you want?

Rachel, no!

To control what you can't
have, you fucking coward!

You cannot have them,

but you can have me.

Don't!

(INDISTINCT VOICES)


Finally, we are one,
you and I.

You will see
what you want to see.

<i>fear, anger, love?</i>

<i>Guiding every soul to death.</i>

<i>Why did he destroy us?</i>

<i>We only came</i>

You will show me
what he sees in you

<i>like your mother would not.</i>

<i>So I may become</i>
<i>what he desires.</i>

<i>So I may become...</i>

<i>Like...</i>

<i>God!</i>

MATT: Keep going,
Anna. Come on.

Keep going, make it work.


No!

(DEVICE POWERING UP)

What just happened?

I think I did it.

MATT: Did what?
What did you do?

ANNA: I... I don't know.
I... I just did
what was in the notes.

MATT: What did that do?
Where did it go?

ANNA: I don't know,
but it's gone, isn't it?


ANNA: Ray, did you put
that on your neck?

Did you put it there?
Why did you do that?

Ray...
Rachel,
what did you do?

Why would you do that?

RACHEL: I don't know.
I just did it.

Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

We're gonna find a way
to take it off, okay?

Don't worry.

Yeah, there's so much stuff
in those research notes.

I'll read through it all.
I'll find something.

Okay, can I see that?

We have to get rid of it.

We have to hide it somewhere
where nobody can find it.

I'm staying here.

You can't.

That thing
is controlling people.

I've got to do something,
I can't just
leave them like this.

What if it comes back?

It comes back.

No.

Sorry.

Sorry, are you okay?
I'm fine.

I'm more worried
about you.

You don't have anything
to worry about.


I love you.

I love you, too.

You girls have to go.

The gas can in the car
should be enough

to get you
far enough away.
Okay.

ANNA:
Hey, be careful, okay?

I'm not sure
that's gonna help.

You guys call for help
as soon as
humanly possible, okay?

I mean,
as soon as possible.
Yeah.

Good luck.

Ray?

Don't let anyone take
that thing off your neck.

Wh... Why?

I took it off Eaton.
I think it killed him.

So until we know
anything more,
just don't touch it, okay?

Okay.

See you soon.
Take care of each other.

(GRUNTING SOFTLY)

The notes. I left them
in the house. I should...
I should get those.

Hey, you okay?


Yeah.
