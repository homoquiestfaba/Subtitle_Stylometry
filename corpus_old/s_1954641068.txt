The carriege falling into the marge

We were shot down over the sea

My crew was trap

I tried to take you away

They discovered my plan, now they won't let me near you

They're sending me to asylum
So i'm leaving this letter with my solicitor, Mr. Grome

They can not stop him from giving it to you
when you're older

You grown up thingking Alice Drablow was your mother
But she is not

Your father, Charles Drablow got me pregnant

This is the truth

Please believe it, i will never let you go

So please, come to me as soon as you can

For i was, am and always shall be your mother

Jannet Humphrey

He died two days later

So he never knew

Never knew she was his mother

It's preposterous-
Even if you don't believe me, Why take the chance -

Harry will take us to the station and we'll just leave -
Enough - Jean -

...I'm telling you that we have to -
Get out -

Go on

You want to? i dont want you here a moment longer

I won't leave them here

I found Joyce today, trying to strangled her self

Don't you see, you poison them

Don't you see, She's been seen

We can't leave, we need to get the children to the sellar

Now

I've tried looking for him but..

They won't tell me where he was

or his name

after while i just gave up

I let him go

We can't let the past 

It's just too much to do

too much to live for, right?

She knows -
it's got nothing to do with her -

she told me

You let him go

That was Alice, remember she said she blamed her 
fot Nathaniel's death

Made her watch it over, and over again

This is got nothing to do with you

You're wrong

Eve, You need to listen to me

She wants to take something away from me

What?

Everybody stay together
