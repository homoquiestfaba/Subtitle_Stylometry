<i>We're gonna be real
Rough Riders in the building.</i>

<i>You know, I ain't stopping until our
high school squad is an All Star squad.</i>

<i>Are you all down?
We've got your back, Lina.</i>

Yeah, girl, we tighter
than a new weave.

Go! Fight! Kill!
I mean, win!

<i>Where you going,
cheer-quitas?</i>

The Spirit Championship.

<i>That's where the baddest
All Star squads go to compete.</i>

<i>You don't look like
no All Stars, ma.</i>

<i>Well, we're not. Yet.
But we will be.</i>

<i>Then I guess you
ain't got one of these.</i>

<i>That's an All Star
bracelet. But...</i>

Only the best of the best cheerleaders
win those. How did you get one?

How you think?
You probably stole it.

I know you did.

Whatever.

<i>That's going on right here.
Come on, bring it.</i>

Catalina!

<i>No, mami!</i>

Lina, what are you doing?

<i>She married the gabacho!</i>

<i>Stop! You're
ruining everything!</i>

Stop!

<i>What's going on here?</i>

Cheer your
little barrio hearts out!

<i>But Lina's coming to live with
me and my daughter in Malibu!</i>

No!

It was just a dream.

It was just a bad dream.

Now the real nightmare begins.

Oh, whoa, whoa.

Let me help you
with that, Wife.

Thank you, Husband.

<i>I know we sound silly, but I'll
never get tired of hearing it.</i>

<i>And I'll never get
tired of saying it.</i>

<i>I'm glad I skipped breakfast.</i>

<i>Lina, you don't have to go
to school today, honey.</i>

<i>Actually, yes, I do.
It's my last day in East LA,</i>

and as captain, I need to
handle some squad business.

I can give you
a ride if you want.

<i>Mmm-mmm.
No. I'd rather walk.</i>

Or get dragged by a bus.

Lina, be nice.

<i>Look, I'm gonna be
late. I have to go.</i>

All right. Bye.

Sorry.
Oh. No, no, no. Honey, listen,

<i>you got to give her a
little time. She'll adjust.</i>

<i>Then we'll be one big happy
family. I promise. Okay?</i>

I hate him. And his
daughter, she creeps me out.

<i>She's like way too
Single White Female.</i>

<i>She's probably just mad excited
about having a new sister.</i>

Treyvonetta, come on.
Sky is not my sister.

Not by cheer,
blood or marriage.

I feel you, Lina,
but for real though,

<i>girl, you can't complain
about moving to Malibu.</i>

You about to be living large.

Yeah, right.

Uh-oh. Love birds alert.

Wassup?

Trey and Lina are
here, okay? I got to go.

<i>Come on, mija,
you know I love you.</i>

As much as you love this car?

Hey,

<i>at least she lets me get
under the hood. You don't.</i>

Watch it, girl.

Oh! I will watch it.

<i>You don't want none of
these Golden Gloves.</i>

Get him, G.

<i>Easy, Oscar de la Ha-Ha. And you'd
better not be late picking me up.</i>

What did I tell you about bossing me around
in front of your girly girls like that?

At 4:30, Victor.

<i>You can't
tell me what to do.</i>

<i>I'm a man.</i>

<i>I'll be here at 4:15 to
pick up your little pom poms.</i>

Hey, make sure you two watch over
my baby girl for me, all right?

Victor, go.
We got this. Go.

In the Gloria-mobile.

This is so messed up, man!

<i>I mean, now we're never gonna get
to be All Stars without you, Lina.</i>

<i>No, no, no.
We're going to be All Stars.</i>

<i>These quickie marriages,
they never last. I'll be back.</i>

<i>Okay, so if you're so sure
you're gonna be back,</i>

<i>then why don't you just
come and stay with me?</i>

Because my mom thinks that
going to school in Malibu

is the best thing that
ever happened to me.

<i>She's like, "You'll get a better education.
It's safe. I won't have to worry. "</i>

Seriously, what is
there to worry about?

Besides, this is the first year
our squad is actually tight enough

to become real All Stars.

<i>That's what I'm
talking about.</i>

<i>Show everyone we're for real.</i>

<i>See, that's what
I'm talking about.</i>

<i>I want you to be
captain while I'm gone.</i>

Mmm-hmm. Me?
Captain? Yeah. Why?

Because, besides me, like, you
have the most cheer experience.

That is true, G.

<i>You probably came out the
womb like this, "Give me a... "</i>

That looks like me.

<i>But I don't do captain, all
right? I hate being in charge, man.</i>

Whatever, you the one that got Victor
wrapped around your baby finger.

Yeah.
I think you can handle it.

<i>That's because I've got
something Victor wants.</i>

<i>But he ain't gonna get it.</i>

<i>He ain't gonna get it!</i>

Okay, you guys, the new beginning
until the ripple goes like this.

<i>We're gonna change it now. It
starts with the same arm, same leg.</i>

It goes one, two, three, four.
Girls go back on five.

Hit six, six, seven
then eight. Ripple style.

<i>Yeah, let's try that
with the music. Ready?</i>

Five, six, seven, eight. Go one,
two, three, four. Go back, six...

This is a cheer-wreck.

Yeah, our girl is
dying over there.

I feel like a witness
to a cheer-icide.

<i>You think she'll get better?
Hell no.</i>

Really!

Listen, you all need
to drop the attitude,

<i>because while I'm gone,
Gloria is gonna be the captain.</i>

<i>Okay, it's like that, huh?</i>

<i>That's not very captain-like.</i>

<i>Oh! I'm sorry. My bad.</i>

Look, if we want to be All Stars, then
we need to practice like All Stars. Okay?

<i>Now let's do this. Line up.</i>

Yeah, okay.
Keep it loose.

<i>Oh! This ought to be good.
Charmaine, don't forget,</i>

pop on six, not seven.

Five, six,
seven, eight. Music.

Right. Okay.

<i>Remember, All Stars,
that's what we want.</i>

Yes. Yes.

All right. Pick it up.

Okay, this is tight.
This is tight, ladies.

Now, out!

In you go, hard.

That was hot. Go.

Bring it in.

Come on.

East LA! East LA!
East LA! East LA!

East LA! East LA!
East LA! East LA!

In your face.

<i>But they couldn't do
that five minutes ago.</i>

<i>What's this?
Just a little something</i>

<i>so you won't forget us.</i>

<i>Come on, guys, I can't forget
you. You're my cheer sisters.</i>

I miss you guys already.

Come back soon,
you know, Lina. Real soon.

<i>Catalina, mi amor, mi amor.
It's time to go.</i>

East Los.
Forever.

<i>Don't forget us, Lina.
We love you.</i>

So, how many
families live here?

One. But it just
doubled in size.

<i>Now, listen, I want you both to feel
really comfortable here. Mi casa es su casa.</i>

Thanks, Enrique.

<i>Come on, that's not how
Henry pronounces his name.</i>

<i>It's okay. She can call
me whatever she wants.</i>

Really? Well how about...

Only if you can
say it in church.

<i>Well that's really gonna
limit my vocabulary.</i>

Wow!

This is my room?

<i>I don't think I belong
here, you guys.</i>

Oh...

<i>Oh. No. Now that's bootleg.</i>

How are they gonna have a broken
toilet right next to a new one?

<i>It's not a toilet, Lina.
It's a bidet.</i>

A... What?

A bidet.

You use it to wash your...

No, no, no.

<i>That's nasty. How...</i>

<i>I don't even drink out of a public
fountain. You expect me to use that?</i>

Oh! I told Dad you were funny.

<i>Thanks, Sky, but your
dad doesn't know me.</i>

<i>He doesn't really even
know my mother, either.</i>

<i>Maybe, but I don't
think it really matters.</i>

He said with Isabel,
it was love at first sight.

<i>You mean first he saw her
culata. And then he saw her tetas.</i>

What?

Nothing.

<i>Anyway, we're sisters now.
I have always wanted a sister.</i>

<i>It's gonna to take more than a marriage
license to be considered sisters.</i>

Yeah, I know that.

Even the Brady
Bunch had issues.

Right.

<i>Anyway, I'm supposed
to tell you dinner's ready.</i>

<i>You know what, I'm good. I'm actually
kind of tired. It's been a long day.</i>

Okay.

Unfortunately.

Remember, work on the sync
in the table top combination

and make sure that
Trey sticks her full back.

Yeah, okay. No problem.

<i>Hey, what's it like there?</i>

<i>Lifestyles of the
Rich and Annoying.</i>

You have to see this!

<i>This girl's room is
like a cheer-seum.</i>

Her mother won championships
three times!

<i>Wow! Oye, guey, that girl must
have cheerleading in her blood.</i>

<i>From what I've seen, I think
it skipped a generation.</i>

Looking for me?
Girl, I got to go.

Is this you and your mom?

Yeah.
Wow.

She must have been
an amazing cheerleader.

<i>Don't! I really don't like
people touching her stuff.</i>

<i>Sorry.
It's fine.</i>

<i>It's no problem. Here.</i>

Okay. Come on.

<i>You don't want to be late
for your first day of school.</i>

Right, because being
the new kid is so much fun.

Yeah. So the pool and
the stadium are over there.

And you can get vegan
or sushi for lunch.

And...

Oh.

<i>That's the Tai Chi class, which
doesn't count for PE credit.</i>

Go figure.

Who are they?

Malibu Jaguars.

All Star squad.

They belong to the cheerleading
gym across the street,

but unfortunately some of
them go to school here.

The Jaguars? They won the
Spirit Championship last year.

<i>Avery's the captain.</i>

<i>Now, she's a hater.
A Sea Lion hater.</i>

Why?

<i>She used to be one of us but we
didn't vote her captain, so she quit.</i>

She took all of our best
cheerleaders with her.

<i>Hey, you just can't
just walk up to them.</i>

Watch me.

Avery?

The Jaguars were sick last
year at the Spirit Championship.

<i>I'm sorry,
no autographs today.</i>

<i>No, look, look, I'm not
a groupie. I'm Catalina.</i>

My East LA squad is like this
close to becoming All Stars, too.

<i>Wow! And I'm like
this close to caring.</i>

<i>I bet you'll care when we take that
bracelet away from you this year.</i>

Cute.

<i>But then you'd
have to beat us.</i>

<i>And that's just not happening.</i>

Like her outfit.

Was I talking to you?

Excuse me.

No, no, no. No time
for cat fights, Kayla.

As a matter of fact, Cat,

<i>why don't you go back
to East LA? Just go south,</i>

<i>and when you start to
smell poverty, you're home.</i>

Excuse me, but, Lina,
she lives here now.

<i>Wait. Your mother's that Mexican
maid who married Sky's daddy.</i>

<i>She doesn't look Mexican.</i>

<i>For your information,
we're Cuban-American.</i>

Fascinating.

And my mother was a waitress.

A maid with tips.

<i>You know, y'all are lucky that my girls are
not here, because if they were here, we...</i>

You know what, save
the urban drama, Cat.

<i>After all, you're
the lucky one.</i>

I mean, you got to
meet real All Stars today.

They give Malibu-Americans
a bad name.

And guess what.
Game over. We won by two.

<i>Oh! That's gross.</i>

<i>I'm sorry. And you are?</i>

Lina. Who are you?

<i>I'm surprised you
have to ask. I'm Evan.</i>

Well, Evan, you
have a booger.

Uh...

Hi.

So, we just figured
out your style.

So are these old clothes? Are
they supposed to be vintage?

No, more like
homeless couture.

<i>Look, I don't care what
you label whores think.</i>

<i>Where I'm from, this is tight.</i>

<i>But you're here now,</i>

and you kind of stand
out like bad teeth.

Look, if you guys want
to take this outside,

we can do this.

Hold up, jalapeno.

<i>Yeah, Cat. You know, it's one
thing to be a fashion don't,</i>

but unless you want them to
give you a permanent facial,

<i>don't threaten me.</i>

You must be Lina.

Yeah, and who are you?

<i>I'm Sky's friend, Christina.
Yeah, we're on the squad together.</i>

<i>You're a cheerleader?</i>

Go Sea Lions.

<i>Look, no offense, but you sound
like you've had a cheer-botomy.</i>

<i>How come people always say "No
offense" right before they offend you?</i>

<i>Look, it's been a...</i>

<i>No offense, Lina,
but you're just like them.</i>

Hey, Lina.

Tell me you guys nailed the Liberty
combination! We have to hit every stunt.

Lina, Hold on. Victor,
enough with the up and down.

You really want to see my
up and down? Okay, babe.

Girl, we got a problem.

<i>No. Don't tell me that, Gloria.
Step up! Make them practice harder.</i>

I did, but...

Motivate them! Inspire them!

<i>There's nobody left to inspire,
all right? Everybody quit.</i>

I mean, of course,
except Trey.

My team quit? Why?

<i>Because. Lina, I'm not you.</i>

<i>All right?
And they don't think that</i>

<i>I can make them All Stars, and
honestly, neither do I. I'm sorry.</i>

<i>It's okay. I know you...
I know you tried.</i>

I really did.

<i>But, hey, it's not all bad, you know.
You still get to be Princess Lina.</i>

Living in Malibu.

Jaguars!

<i>It ain't all good here,
mi hermana.</i>

Look, I got to bounce.
My bus is here.

She just hung up.

Sorry about your team.

<i>I'll deal with it later.</i>

Sure.

But if you wanna keep up your skills until
then, we have a spot on the Sea Lions.

Are you serious?

<i>My squad ain't even cold yet and
you're already cheer-jocking me?</i>

<i>You're right.</i>

<i>I'm so sorry. I...</i>

Why did you say that to Sky?

<i>Why? It's not like
she's my real sister.</i>

At least in East LA
I had family.

You have family here
now, too, Lina.

<i>And Sky's been through
so much already.</i>

How would you feel
if you lost me?

<i>All right, I guess
I'll try to be nicer.</i>

<i>You're gonna do
a lot more than try.</i>

<i>You're gonna be joining
the Sea Lions.</i>

Trying out, huh?

No, just checking things out.

<i>That's cool.</i>

You know, they kind of suck
after my sister quit.

<i>No. You're Avery's brother?</i>

Not in her fan club, huh?

<i>I'm starting my own club. It's called
the League of Avery Can Kiss My Butt.</i>

<i>Yeah? Well, you won't
be the only member.</i>

<i>You know, every pretty girl
doesn't have to be a cheerleader.</i>

I mean, the stuff they
do is way hard anyway.

<i>It's not that hard.</i>

Oh. No?

<i>Okay, that's easy
for a non-cheerleader to say.</i>

Okay.

<i>So what's your thing?
You play ball?</i>

Maybe.
Think you can step?

Here, take a shot. Really.

No, no, no, really this time.
Go ahead.

Okay.
Go ahead. Right there.

<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

Sorry, coach.

<i>You think I'm a
klutz, don't you?</i>

Maybe a little.

Come here.

This is how you shoot.

<i>That's it.</i>

<i>It's perfect.</i>

Peep this.

Okay.

Lina! Hey, you came!

Good news. You made the team.

<i>Let's face it,
she is the team.</i>

And we voted
you team captain.

<i>But you're captain.</i>

Yeah. By default, and I suck.

But you are really good.

Yeah.

You could fix us.

You know, I thought
I can do this, but no.

Come on.
Come on.

Use your powers for good.

<i>I mean, we do cheer
at, like, all of Evan's games.</i>

Yeah.

<i>So? I don't care about him.</i>

Right.

<i>We'll pretend like
we believe that.</i>

Please, Lina, we will work really hard.
Because we could be really good. I promise.

<i>I'd settle for upright.</i>

Good luck with that.

We still have to
fill another spot.

You could fill it with whoever you want
to. It could be somebody good. I just...

Yeah? Like who?

You swear to help me out?

I will do whatever it takes.

<i>Okay, I'm in.</i>

Yes? Can I help you?

Lina!

Meet the newest
member of our squad.

Go, Sea Crabs!
Sea Lions.

You said to make
more of an effort.

<i>Oye, guey, you got
one smoking casa!</i>

Thank you.

<i>Okay. Henry's kindness is no excuse
for you to take advantage of him, Lina!</i>

Not even a little?

<i>Gloria, tu mama, she
must be worried about you.</i>

I almost forgot.

<i>She's got to go to work, but she'll
call you in the morning to thank you.</i>

I have a boyfriend.

Mama thinks this is like putting me
in the Virginity Protection Program.

<i>You do realize that there's
a waiting list at MV, right?</i>

<i>Dad, can't you, like,
dialog with the principal?</i>

<i>Dialog? Please tell me you're
not teaching her hood talk.</i>

Come on, Dad. Strings
get pulled all the time.

<i>George Bush got into
Yale, didn't he?</i>

Come on. No cheerleader
left behind.

Please, Daddy? Please.

<i>She used the "Daddy" card.
She's good.</i>

All right.

Thank you.
Thank you.

Five, six, seven, eight.

Are those the Mountain Lions?

<i>It's the Sea Lions.
And no, those are the Jaguars.</i>

No. That was a big
bowl of wrong!

Yeah.

Looks like Dora the
Explorer has a new pal.

<i>Seriously, Cat,
you're like a stalker.</i>

<i>Don't you have anything else,
I don't know, better to do?</i>

Better than watching you sweat
off a spray tan? Yes, I do.

<i>As a matter of fact, I'm
going to Sea Lion practice.</i>

They voted me captain.

<i>And you're bragging about it.
What a cheer-barrassment.</i>

<i>Don't act like you didn't want to be
the captain of the Sea Lions, Avery.</i>

That was way back
when I was into charity.

<i>I'm so over that.</i>

Over.

<i>You're a big muscular girl.</i>

Are you gonna practice
with the Sea Lions, too?

Or just bench press them?

Wait, wait,
wait. She said you have

<i>grande muscles.
Strong like bull.</i>

Oh...

<i>I'm bilingual. Right?
I speak bitch, too.</i>

<i>You got them right, man.
Cheer-brujas. Mean and bony.</i>

<i>Better than fat.
Let's go.</i>

You know... In a sec.

<i>But your girls,
they're coming in too early.</i>

They need to hold
on one, and then...

Right. Now train your
little Sea Lions to do that.

<i>Then maybe I'll be impressed.</i>

<i>I'd rather be a Sea Lion,
if this is the best you got.</i>

<i>So, Cat, I'm guessing your little amiga
hasn't seen the rest of the pod squad yet.</i>

Has she?

<i>They're really good. Really.</i>

Really good.

Your Sea Otters
got skills, right?

They have potential.

Really? Where do they keep it?

Why is that girl dancing
with her tongue out?

She said it helps
her concentrate.

<i>I used to have a dog who did
that. He couldn't cheer either.</i>

<i>Okay. All right, I know it's bad, but,
Christina, she's got tumbling skills</i>

and Sky has spirit.

<i>And don't forget her mom
won, like, every award.</i>

<i>Like, deep down, she's got
cheerleading in her gut!</i>

<i>Too bad it's not in
her brain or muscles.</i>

<i>We've got some work to do.</i>

Yeah.

Six, seven, eight.

One, two, three...
Load it out.

Load it out.

...four, five, six,
seven, eight.

One, two, three, four.

High knees. High knees.

<i>Six. You ain't cute.</i>

One, two, three,
four, five, six.

Hey! Hey.

Four, five, six. One.

Are you okay?

You all right, man?

<i>I'd rather eat
underwear and die.</i>

Sweaty, day-old,
butt-wedgie underwear.

Whitney, come back!

<i>She was one of our best dancers. I
mean, I know that's not saying much,</i>

but what are we
supposed to do now?

<i>I've got an idea.</i>

In the house!

<i>This is nice! You all
should go on Cribs.</i>

<i>Hey, I'm Treyvonetta.</i>

Girl, how many
bedrooms you all got?

Six bedrooms and seven
and a half baths.

We can each have
own our own suite.

Nice! Sweet!

<i>I'll show you a tour.</i>

Okay, Gloria, Trey and I are
gonna break it down for you. Okay?

Five, six, seven, eight.

One, two, three and four.
Five, six, seven, eight.

One and two, three and four.
Five, six and roll it out.

One, two, three and give it.

I feel so white.

Me, too.
Like Clay Aiken white.

Okay, okay. Come on, get up.

You know, rhythm has no color.
You know, just shake and jive.

<i>Gonna have some fun.
That's right! Come on.</i>

Shake what your mama gave you.

I mean, we just could keep the old
routine until, like, after the game.

Or until we graduate.

Look, you want this school
to respect you, right?

Yeah.
Yeah.

Then you need to
respect yourselves.

Which means you need
to improve on your skills.

<i>That's right. So let's
drop it like it's hot.</i>

Hit it, girl.
Take notes.

<i>Yeah. Is there an easier version
that's maybe, like, lukewarm?</i>

Sky, this is the easy version.

Now, come on, Sea Lions.

<i>You can do this.
That's right, come on.</i>

All right. Get into formation.

<i>Gloria, look who's here.</i>

Victor!

Victor!

You came all the way
out here to see me.

<i>You're my chulita.</i>

<i>I'd follow you anywhere.</i>

<i>That's sweet.</i>

Can you spot me
a twenty for gas?

No!

Damn!

<i>Yo, who's this?</i>

<i>I'm Sky. It's a
pleasure to meet you.</i>

<i>So you're Lina's sister
from another mister.</i>

<i>I haven't thought of it like
that. No, no. Not really.</i>

Hey, Lina. Who is that dude
over there checking you out?

Oh!

Go ahead, Lina.

<i>That boy's finer
than baby hair.</i>

<i>Whatever. He's just some guy.</i>

<i>Yeah, right. Evan's, like,
the most popular guy in school.</i>

<i>Please. I'm not impressed.</i>

Lina, if Malibu Ken
is sweating you,

I can put that fool in
check, real quick.

Look at this guy.
Look at this guy.

<i>Go get him, papi. You go!</i>

Do that.

<i>What's happening?</i>

<i>He's a mess.</i>

<i>What's up, bro?</i>

Dude, is that your ride?

Yeah, foo, cherried-out,
top of the line hydraulics.

What do you know
about that, beach boy?

<i>She's a head turner.</i>

All right. Check this out.

<i>I hope he doesn't
scare him too much.</i>

<i>He'll be good.</i>

<i>He's supposed to scare him,
not be all lovey-dovey.</i>

What?

<i>She's pimped to the max.</i>

Thanks, man.

<i>You know, that's tight you
know how we roll in East Los.</i>

<i>I'm Victor.</i>

Evan.

<i>What... They look like
they're about to hug.</i>

<i>They're hugging.</i>

<i>Dude, that's what happens when you send
a Chihuahua to do the job of a pit bull.</i>

<i>So, what's up, Evan?
You trying to push up on Lina?</i>

<i>Dude, I'm trying.</i>

But I swear, every time I step
to her, I say something stupid.

<i>So, I don't know
how well it's going.</i>

<i>Bro, you just got to know
how to handle these chicas.</i>

You got to be in charge, homie. Yeah.

<i>They love that. Come on, man.
I'll show you how it's done.</i>

Come on. Come on, man.

Wait, wait, wait. Why
are they coming over here?

Wait. Quick, quick,
quick. Lip check.

Lip Smacker. Here.

Perfect. Watermelon.

Thanks.

Gloria...
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

<i>Let's roll out. Evan here
wants to holla' at your girl.</i>

Okay. Are you cool?

Yes, whatever.

<i>Okay. We'll wait for
you in the car.</i>

Mmm-hmm.

Quit staring. Come on.

<i>See, that's how you do it.</i>

Come on.

So...
So...

We should hang out.

Yeah, right.

Your sister would freak out if
she saw us hanging out together.

<i>Come on. Let her freak.
It's nothing new.</i>

Okay.
Yeah?

<i>Maybe. I'll think about it.</i>

<i>Okay. I'll see you at the game tomorrow.</i>

Yes, you will.

Get up, get up, quick.
Give me your hand.

<i>They're even worse than
they were before. I love it.</i>

I knew this would be worth
being late for practice.

<i>Let's put them out
of their misery.</i>

Jaguars.

<i>We can't just walk out.</i>

Hell, no.

Come on.

Jaguars!
Jaguars!

<i>If you want to win, yell with all your
might! When we say "Go," you say "Fight!"</i>

Go!
Fight!

Go!
Fight!

Malibu Vista!

This is Sea Lion territory.

<i>Don't ever shake your conceited
Jag butt over here again.</i>

<i>Excuse me. Then who's supposed to show
our school what a real squad looks like?</i>

Not this mariachi band.

<i>You're so lucky I found Jesus.</i>

<i>Hey, hey, hey. Okay?
I didn't use my hands.</i>

<i>All right. But you
can't fight girls like this.</i>

They press charges.
Right.

Run away.

Jaguars.

Emergency practice session?

Yes. As long as it takes.

<i>Lina. Look, I'm sorry
about my sister.</i>

<i>She's...
Forgotten.</i>

Okay. Works for me.

Why is your brother talking
to Miss Chiquita Banana?

<i>He's always dating down.
But don't you worry.</i>

<i>I'll fix it.</i>

You know, I need to take
care of some team stuff.

Yeah.

<i>I would, too, if my team got
spanked like that. I'd...</i>

<i>I mean, I'll just catch
up with you later.</i>

Okay. I see the little wheels
turning in your evil little head.

What you thinking?

<i>That we're outnumbered
and unarmed.</i>

If we were surrounded by all these
people back home, what would we do?

<i>Pretend to no habla ingles?</i>

Use our white voices?

No.

Call for backup.

Honestly, I was gonna say run.

<i>But let's do that.</i>

Guys, I know exactly
what we need to do.

<i>Lina, I don't think
this was a good idea.</i>

How do they move
their bodies like that?

<i>Don't be scared, Sky.
Look, I got you looking good.</i>

This is impromptu flavor
school for you guys.

<i>We're about to
loosen you guys up.</i>

What do you mean?

<i>You'll see.</i>

<i>What's wrong now?</i>

Nothing. I just realized
something.

I just realized Lina
already has two sisters.

<i>She doesn't need me.</i>

<i>Come on, you're being so
Betty Buzzkill right now.</i>

I know you better than anyone else and it
seems to me like you both need each other.

I have homework.
I should go home.

Sky?

<i>Man, you look hot.
Dance with me, chulita.</i>

Okay.

Christina?

I have a 4.0 GPA. Leave
me alone, Betty Buzzkill.

Yeah.

Yeah, baby.

Sky, want to dance?

No, thanks.

<i>Come on.
No, I'm good.</i>

You know you want to.

<i>No, I'm good right here.
Thank you.</i>

Sky!

<i>Sky, come on. Let's go.</i>

<i>Sky's in the house.</i>

<i>Come on, girl. Don't be
scared. Shake it. Yeah.</i>

Come on, make us proud, Sky.

Look at those hips.

All right.

Lina.

<i>You know, it's called
stalking, Evan.</i>

Yeah?

<i>Let me guess. Your new friend
Victor told you I'd be here.</i>

Yeah, maybe.

<i>You know, but I cannot believe you didn't
invite me to your little party yourself.</i>

I mean, especially after I told
everyone how much I like you.

<i>It's just rude.</i>

You did not.

No, but I will.

Are you always this corny?

You just make me nervous.

Me?
Yeah.

<i>Why? You're Mr. Popularity.</i>

Come on.

<i>That's what those other kids see me
as. But you don't. And I dig that.</i>

<i>Christina, why can't we
be more like them?</i>

Because we took
a purity pledge.

<i>But that doesn't mean we can't be
more cool and hot like they are.</i>

I guess.

Uh-oh.

Yo, what you looking at?

Who, me?

Nothing. Are you
calling my girl nothing?

I saw the way you
was looking at her.

What way? There was a way?

<i>No, there's no way.
I was just looking.</i>

So you admit you
was looking at me.

<i>All right, I'm gonna show you
something to look at.</i>

Wait. You want to fight me
because I looked at you?

What, did you think you could just
look at my girl and get away with it?

<i>Uh-uh. We don't
play that here.</i>

Christina, do something.

Lina! Lina! Help!

<i>They're gonna kill Sky!</i>

<i>Wait, hold up. Wait,
what's the problem?</i>

<i>I don't know. I mean, I
was just looking at her.</i>

And then she came
down the stairs and...

No! Why, Sky?

<i>Sky, you just can't
be looking at people.</i>

I mean, the last girl that
looked at me needed stitches.

<i>Yo, what's up with your girl,
Lina? Staring like she loco.</i>

You know the deal.

<i>Yeah, I do, but she don't.</i>

<i>She's from Malibu.</i>

Like, people over there just be looking
at each other for no reason. All the time.

<i>Let me talk to her and explain
it. She'll be straight. Okay?</i>

<i>Fine. We didn't come
here to fight, no way.</i>

Will somebody tell
me what just happened.

<i>Sky, you can't just be looking
at people any kind of way.</i>

Like, you can glance at somebody
and smile. But if you stare at them

or you give them one of these.

Or one of these.

<i>That's disrespectful.</i>

And your ass.

<i>You understand, chica?</i>

Yeah. I think so.

Good, next time we bring you to
East LA, bring your sunglasses.

Yeah. Big ones.

All right, come, honey.

<i>It's all good.
Everything okay?</i>

Yeah, come on.

Five, six,
seven, eight. Two.

Five, six, seven, eight. Two.

<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

Two, four.

God...

I suck. Great.

Okay. One...

Hold your chest up.

<i>What's the use?</i>

<i>I'm nothing like my mother.</i>

<i>Sky, look, I'm sure
that's not true.</i>

<i>Because as much as I hate to
admit it, I'm a lot like my mom.</i>

<i>I'm opinionated, stubborn...</i>

Loud.

Yeah, that, too.

Which means you have to have
a part of your mom in you.

You really think so?

Yeah, I really do.

Well, would you
help me find her?

Yeah.

Ready? Five, six, seven,
eight. One, two, three, four.

Keep your chest up. Seven, eight.
One, two, three and sit in it.

Five, six, seven, clap.

<i>That's what I'm
talking about. It's fun.</i>

Here we go! Malibu Vista on the
move. Taking all you fools to school.

<i>We're caliente.
You know, hot, hot, hot.</i>

<i>We always stay on top. We make
you sweat 'cause we run faster.</i>

<i>Try to catch up
and we say hasta.</i>

Sea Lions! Sea Lions!
Sea Lions! Sea Lions!

Sea Lions!
Sea Lions!

Oh, my God. That was fun.

Someone just had a cheer-gasm.

What? No!
You guys are crazy.

<i>Don't front, Lina.</i>

<i>She don't need to. She's already
got Evan's nose wide open.</i>

Whatever.
You know. For real, though.

<i>That boy's nose is so open you could
drive a truck up those nostrils.</i>

<i>What's this?
It's a shoe-vite.</i>

<i>I'm having a RDD party
and I want you guys to come.</i>

<i>Look, Avery isn't in charge of the
social order at Malibu Vista. I am.</i>

And despite the little debacle
at the game the other day,

everyone can see that Lina is
making the Sea Lions fabulente!

Everybody is talking
about it. So...

See you there?
And, please, dress to excess!
