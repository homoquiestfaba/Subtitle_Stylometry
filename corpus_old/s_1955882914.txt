[man 1] We should put a ban
on eating turtles.

[man 2] Turtle soup is damn good soup.

[man 1] I'm gonna post signs around town,

saying don't eat the turtles.

[man 3] There's a guy who said

the whole planet is sitting

on a giant turtle's back.

[horse whinnies]

And then it's turtles all the way down.

[electric guitar continues]

[man 2] Multi-dimensional turtles?

[man 1] Yes, turtles as far
as you can dive,

down into the cosmos.


<i>many moons ago.</i>..

[men chatter and overlap narrator]

-[man 1] Multi-dimensional turtles?
-[man 2] Yeah.

[man 1] That's why there's none left
around here.

<i>People, leave them turtes alone</i>

[man 2] Leave them turtles alone.

[man 1] That should be a song.

Have some manners.

[man 2] Get a pen.

-[man 1] I don't have a pen.

Here you are, sir.

God made dirt...

[chickens clucking]

Sorry, big boy, everyone gets
the same portion.

[in hoarse deep voice] I'll be back.

[electric guitar continues]

Always look at the food
you're about to eat.

It's important to know what it is...

but it's critical to know what it was.

Marmot.


Damn.

[to himself] Ungrateful bastard.

Mm. I love marmot.

Tasty vittles, McCormick.

I like this marmot.

Mm. Just deal.

I'll cut them. Nice cut.

Alright <i>seÃ±or,</i> listen.

Those two fellows...

that's the Nelson brothers. The one on the left, the oldest...

He's a gunslinger.

They call him "Jailtime".

The other one...

"The Particle Kid".

Nobody knows what planet that boy is from.

[goggles rattling]

The Man in the Black Hat...

They all steer clear of him.

I heard he can be kind of shaky.

Whatever you do, don't let him

get that stare fixed on you.

He's contrary.

Trouble comes in...

best not go over and sit beside him. [wind blowing heavily]

[Particle Kid] We offer plants.

We come in peace.

Your bet.

Come on, you little motherfucker.

I saw that.

Uh huh.

I'll check to your power.

I'm going to see your check...

and I'm going to raise it...

one.

And you're going to just raise one?

You're just going to bet one?

One... hundred.

[Particle Kid] You lose.

You're making me nervous.

[counting rapidly]

One Brazilian.


You're a dangerous man.


You motherfucker.

Prospecting life.

Ain't got too many prospects.

What about law and order?

Law and order...

Anarchy rules.

That's an oxymoron.

What'd you call me?


Get the hell out of my kitchen.

Goddammit.


I ain't never being here before.

And you can kiss my ass.

That's what you are.

Don't you?

Don't try to come in my kitchen.

Kill that mother...


You've got to go.

Goddammit.

Give me back my hat.

Son of a bitch.

[men laugh]




[man 1] Mind your fucking bullshit.

[man 2] Gonna get me a shiny piece...

for shiny lady?

["Digging Song" plays]

[man 3] Sucks.

[man laughs]

Find something beside that bad boy.

[Particle Kid] Find something good?

No, just wire.

But wire's good.

[Particle Kid] That'll be fun for later.

They might like that.

Perfect.

[Weed sighs]

-[crow caws]
-[cow moos]

Sandpaper?


move along,

so I can take a shit.

Alright. Careful of the drop time.

[Particle Kid] I'd say, my drop time...

How deep is it?


I'd say, .37 seconds

until the shit falling like a feather.

[man laughs]


[Particle Kid] You're looking good, too.

You're looking blurry.

[electric guitar chord]

you're about to eat.

It's not important what it is...

but it's crucial to know what it was.

Critical.

[acoustic guitar plays]

-Looks like a Full Corn Moon.
-Yes.

Full Barley Moon.

Magic time.

[scrubbing continues]

Yeah.


My friend.


were a bunch of worthless,

shiny pieces of crap,

for half a lifetime

of digging in the dirt.

[speaking Spanish]

You're telling me, Mexican.

[distant coyote howls]

[both imitate coyote]

[speaking Spanish]

Lots of them singing tonight.

I guess it's time to stop
digging in the dirt

and start this shindig.

[speaking Spanish]

Yes, sir.

[insects chirping]

[soft acoustic guitar playing]

Had a hard day mining,

then he lost at cards.

He does this when he needs
a new perspective.

[Particle Kid]
The mind is like an instrument.

They don't like when you don't use it.

Instruments, now there's a tool.

No better way to wash the day's dirt away
than music.

[Particle Kids] According to Nietsche,

life without music...

that'd be nothing but a damn mistake.

Music is life's great feature.

Preacher, teacher and reacher of hearts.

Music is also very fun.

Yee hah! [Particle Kid] Amen, brother.


Music...gives us the universe.
