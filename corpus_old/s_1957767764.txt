<i>I got you, Sensei. Stay with me.</i>

<i>You're a life saver, Casey Jones.</i>

<i>I learned from the best.
Come on, we're almost there.</i>

<i>Bad doggies!</i>

<i>Impeccable timing, little brother.
Very dramatic.</i>

<i>Help him, Michelangelo. He's hurt bad.</i>

<i>That's it. The resistance failed.
The Krang won.</i>

<i>But... but it isn't over.</i>

<i>We've still got a ninja's
greatest weapon...</i>

<i>hope.</i>

<i>That and a badass mystic warrior.</i>

<i>Mikey, we need a time gateway.</i>

<i>It'll take everything I have.</i>

<i>I know, but this is our last chance.</i>

<i>It's our only chance.</i>

<i>Hm.</i>

<i>- Wait, what's going on? Where is he going?
Casey, listen.</i>

<i>The Krang first came to our planet
through a mystic doorway.</i>

<i>The key that opened the doorway
looked like this.</i>

<i>Why are you telling me this?</i>

<i>Because Mikey's
about to send you back in time</i>

<i>to the day that the key was stolen.</i>

<i>Wait, he's gonna what?</i>

<i>The people who stole that key
opened the doorway for the Krang.</i>

<i>You have to find it before that happens.</i>

<i>Find the key, stop the Krang.</i>

<i>- But, Sensei...
Say it!</i>

<i>"Find the key, stop the Krang."</i>

<i>I don't want to lose you.</i>

<i>Casey, it's not about me.</i>

<i>They found us!</i>

<i>Mikey!</i>

<i>Master Michelangelo, no! You're gonna...</i>

<i>Casey...</i>

<i>when you're done saving the world,
do me a favor.</i>

<i>Grab a slice!</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

<i>Where...</i>

<i>I made it?</i>

<i>All right, Casey, here we go.
Find the key, stop the Krang.</i>

<i>â™ª Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles â™ª</i>

<i>Easy does it, Leo.</i>

<i>You've got this.</i>

<i>Concentrate.</i>

<i>The whole world is counting on you...</i>

<i>to break the pizza box stack record!</i>

<i>One-hundred, twenty-five boxes!</i>

<i>They say it couldn't be done,
but look who's doing it, moi.</i>

<i>That's Spanish for Leo.</i>

<i>Go ahead, my non-lingual friend,
count your unhatched fowl.</i>

<i>My record stands until you reach the top,</i>

<i>which, according to
my calculations of wind speed,</i>

<i>barometric pressure, and dew point,
is highly unlikely. What?</i>

<i>According to my calculations,</i>

<i>as long as you believe in yourself,
you can do anything!</i>

<i>Thanks, little brother.
No one believes in himself more than me.</i>

<i>Leo!</i>

<i>Leo! Leo!Â Leo!Â Leo!Â Leo!</i>

<i>Leo! Leo!Â Leo!Â Leo!Â Leo!</i>

<i>- Yeah! I am Leo!
Yeah, baby!</i>

<i>There you are.</i>

<i>I've been looking all over for you guys.</i>

<i>Raph, guess who just broke the record?</i>

<i>What? You did? How many did you...</i>

<i>Stop distracting Raph!
We were supposed to be training...</i>

<i>Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Hold that thought.</i>

<i>Donnie?</i>

<i>Donnie?</i>

<i>You, sir, have bested me.Mazel.</i>

<i>- Ahem?
Ahem?</i>

<i>Leo. Leo.</i>

<i>Leo! Leo!</i>

<i>Stop it!</i>

<i>Leo, we have work to do,
and you dragged him out here for this?</i>

<i>Training, record-breaking.
The choice was clear.</i>

<i>Dang it, Leo.
Everything's not about you.</i>

<i>When are you gonna grow up
and start acting like a hero?</i>

<i>And there it is. Gentlemen...</i>

<i>- What was that? What are you guys doing?
A little game I invented.</i>

<i>Every time you say "heroes,"
we take a bite of pizza.</i>

<i>I don't say "heroes" that often!</i>

<i>Leo!</i>

<i>So what if I say he... that word a lot.</i>

<i>It's a good word. We need to be that word.</i>

<i>Relax, Raph.
We've got this hero thing wired.</i>

<i>I mean, our ninjocity is off the charts.</i>

<i>We've got some kickin' mystic weapons.</i>

<i>And do I need to remind you who has
four shells and defeated the Shredder?</i>

<i>- Hey.
Leo!</i>

<i>You just don't get it.</i>

<i>Huh? What is all that... That's me.</i>

<i>Looks like we have a 317-39.4 in progress!</i>

<i>Uh-huh?</i>

<i>Oh, come on!</i>

<i>Has nobody read</i> Donnie's Big Book</i>
of Bad Guy Codes? Nobody?</i>

<i>- Nope.
Never gonna happen.</i>

<i>We did it!
We got the whatcha-ma-hoosie-doodle!</i>

<i>Of course we did.</i>

<i>Nothing can stop Supervillain Warren Stone</i>

<i>and his conjuring compatriot,
Hypno-Potamus!</i>

<i>There they are! Okay, here's the plan...</i>

<i>Raph, relax. Who needs a plan
when we got crazy cool mystic powers?</i>

<i>Leo!</i>

<i>Come on, swords, it's portal time!</i>

<i>I'll see you guys later
after I save the day! Buh-buh-bye!</i>

<i>Stop! We need to work together!</i>

<i>Wellington Sunday!
It's those pesky Turtles.</i>

<i>License and registration.</i>

<i>Oh, I'm sorry, mate.
I must have left it in my other jacket.</i>

<i>Leo! Ah!</i>

<i>Leo, we're coming.</i>

<i>- Don't worry.
I got 'em right where I want 'em.</i>

<i>Doesn't look that way to me.
Donnie, Mikey, Maneuver 12.</i>

<i>- On it!
Ha!</i>

<i>Whip-o-rama!</i>

<i>Prepare to be Donnie'd by my mystic tech!</i>

<i>Oh boy.</i>

<i>Okay, creeps, hand over the stolen thingy!</i>

<i>Oh no.</i>

<i>That's gotta be what they stole!</i>

<i>I got it!</i>

<i>With those clumsy hands?
No, I got this one.</i>

<i>Oh, you portal-chopped him!</i>

<i>"Portal-chopped," I like it.
Maybe my new catchphrase?</i>

<i>Okay, let's see how it fits.
"You've been portal chopped!"</i>

<i>Uh-uh-uh-uh.
I'll be taking this.</i>

<i>The Foot Clan?</i>

<i>Finally, after all these centuries,
this is ours.</i>

<i>Yes, well, of course, thanks to us,
delivered safe and sound.</i>

<i>No problemo, partner.</i>

<i>Hey, just quietly, are we partners?
We are partners, yeah?</i>

<i>Oh man, that thing must be dangerous
if the Foot Clan wants it.</i>

<i>Ya think?</i>

<i>Huh? What?</i>

<i>I clearly said, "I got it."
Everybody heard me say, "I got it."</i>

<i>Yeah, but I got it with style.</i>

<i>But you didn't get it!</i>

<i>You lost it, and now
we've got a Foot Clan situation, Leo.</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

<i>What's it gonna take
for you to be serious, Leo?</i>

<i>And end up with a worry line
between my eyes like you?</i>

<i>No, no, no, I do not want a Raph chasm.</i>

<i>"Chasm"?</i>

<i>You know, valley, gorge, crevasse.</i>

<i>The only reason I have a chasm
is I have to worry about you bozos 24/7.</i>

<i>You just don't get it, Leo.</i>

<i>I'm the oldest here.</i>

<i>I'm responsible for keeping us safe</i>

<i>and making sure we can
handle anything that comes our way.</i>

<i>'Cause if I don't,
you could all end up dead.</i>

<i>Sorry, I missed that.</i>

<i>Can you repeat everything from...
well, everything?</i>

<i>No wonder you always want to train.
You really need the practice.</i>

<i>Let him go, Mikey.</i>

<i>Wait! No!</i>

<i>Boys! Stop this arguing!</i>

<i>But, Dad, Leo keeps...</i>

<i>Buh-buh-buh-buh, buh.</i>

<i>No more.</i>

<i>You are a team. You are brothers.</i>

<i>And most importantly, you are too loud!</i>

<i>I cannot hear my TV show!</i>

<i>Tristan finally proposed to Annabelle,
but did she say yes?</i>

<i>I don't know because of you!</i>

<i>Be the ninjas I taught you to be,</i>

<i>respectful and quiet!</i>

<i>Sorry. Excuse me.</i>

{\an8}<i>Hey, how am I supposed to find this thing?</i>

<i>Whoa.</i>

<i>So many people.</i>

<i>How am I gonna save them all, Sensei?</i>

<i>I really wish you were here.</i>

<i>Wait, you are!</i>

<i>I just need to find you.</i>

<i>April.</i>

{\an8}<i>She'll know.</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

<i>Hi, professor. Do you have a sec?</i>

<i>Hmm.</i>

<i>Are you even in this class?</i>

<i>I'm April O'Neil, journalism major.</i>

<i>I write for the
Eastlaird University Daily News.</i>

<i>Maybe I could get some shots of you
at the whiteboard for a story?</i>

<i>Oh! Of course.</i>

<i>So, uh, what... what should I do?</i>

<i>You know, just write something sciencey.</i>

<i>I actually have the perfect equation
for your article.</i>

<i>Now a few where you're
staring thoughtfully at your work.</i>

<i>Oh, I always stare intently
at my equations.</i>

<i>Especially this one.</i>

<i>You know,
I think I should put on my lab coat.</i>

<i>- Look at it!
Oh! Okay.</i>

<i>You know, I could probably
stare at this equation all day.</i>

<i>This is April O'Neil, investigative
reporter, Eastlaird University Daily News.</i>

<i>For years, this college shot down
rumors that a foreign government</i>

<i>is paying them millions</i>

<i>to develop a super-toxic
herbicidal deforestation bomb.</i>

<i>Those rumors end today because
I'm about to blow the lid off Big Chem.</i>

<i>April O'Neil.</i>

{\an8}<i> Ooh. This stuff looks nasty.</i>

{\an8}<i> Hey! Who's there?</i>

<i>Hm?</i>

<i>Evidence, baby.</i>

<i>Oh boy.</i>

<i>Well, it's a good thing video
ain't the only thing I took.</i>

<i>April! Yes!</i>

<i>- Commander O'Neil...
Catlike reflex!</i>

<i>What's the matter with you,
creeping up on a person in the dark?</i>

<i>What the...</i>

<i>And then I saw that picture
and I brought him here.</i>

<i>Sensei?</i>

<i>Hm?</i>

<i>It's you!</i>

<i>It's all of you! Together!</i>

<i>- I never thought I'd see you again!
I'm so happy I could hug you!</i>

<i>Who are you,
and why do you have a picture of us?</i>

<i>Yeah, who took this? 'Cause I look great.</i>

<i>What's your favorite pizza?
'Cause I'm ordering right now.</i>

<i>And why are you
wearing genius-built apparel?</i>

<i>That's trademarked!</i>

<i>Grappling hook!</i>

<i>What's going on?</i>

<i>He's trying to escape!</i>

<i>- Want me to knock him out again?
Let me.</i>

<i>Donnie? Donnie!</i>

<i>Oh, okay.</i>

<i>Wa... Wait, stop!
I'm a friend. Let me explain.</i>

<i>Let's start over.</i>

<i>My name is Casey Jones,
and the reason I have this photo</i>

<i>and your tech
is because you gave it to me,</i>

<i>but not yet, because I'm from...</i>

<i>the future!</i>

<i>This isn't a joke.</i>

<i>Please, if time travel is possible,
future Donnie would have come back</i>

<i>and already given me
all the lottery numbers like we planned.</i>

<i>It's true. I need you to believe me.
Humanity depends on it.</i>

<i>In the future,
an alien race decimated the planet.</i>

<i>We were hunted. We lived in caves.
We ate leaves and rats.</i>

<i>No offense.</i>

<i>None taken. We are delicious.</i>

<i>I know how this sounds,
but Master Leonardo gave me a mission.</i>

<i>I do like how he calls me "Master."</i>

<i>Of course I do.</i>

<i>You are the greatest ninja
the world has ever seen.</i>

<i>You told me to find the key
and stop the Krang.</i>

<i>"Aliens." Pfft.</i>

<i>Sure.
This story just keeps getting better.</i>

<i>Splints?</i>

<i>"The Krang"?</i>

<i>I have heard that name.</i>

<i>Powerful, barbaric creatures
worshiped by the Foot Clan.</i>

<i>Legend says they came from the stars.</i>

<i>Ruthless, unmerciful, with one desire,</i>

<i>to enslave our world
like so many before us.</i>

<i>All seemed lost,</i>

<i>until great mystic warriors
forged a mighty weapon,</i>

<i>a key that was used to lock them
in a prison dimension beyond this realm.</i>

<i>Over the centuries,
the mystic key remained hidden</i>

<i>to protect humankind
and prevent the return of the Krang.</i>

<i>So...</i>

<i>Future boy is really from the future?</i>

<i>Mind...</i>

<i>Someone finds the key! Today!</i>

<i>They steal it and use it
to open a doorway and free the Krang!</i>

<i>That's why I came back, to find it first.</i>

<i>Master Leonardo drew a picture
on the back of that photo.</i>

<i>So to stop the Krang,</i>

<i>all we have to do
is find the key before it's stolen.</i>

<i>- Mm.
Hm-mm.</i>

<i>Huh.</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>Yeah, did future handsome,
amazing me tell you what to do</i>

<i>in case that already happened?</i>

<i>'Cause that already happened.</i>

<i>Mm!</i>

<i>Oh no, we're too late!</i>

<i>No, we're not.</i>

<i>'Cause we know who has the key,
the Foot Clan.</i>

<i>Okay, we gotta find them
before they use it,</i>

<i>and this time, we do it together!</i>

<i>Uh, can someone untie me now?</i>

<i>Oh no...</i>

<i>Villain to villain,
your hideout is a bit... lacking.</i>

<i>Might I suggest some velvet, a fireplace,</i>

<i>maybe a fuzzy white cat
with a diamond necklace?</i>

<i>Tonight, we liberate our masters
from their dimensional prison.</i>

<i>With this key,</i>

<i>we shall free them to lay waste
to this world and enslave its people.</i>

<i>Ah, I thought we were just gonna rob
a bankÂ and be, you know, crime buddies.</i>

<i>We shall follow the Krang
as they lead the Foot Clan to glory!</i>

<i>Bored.</i>

<i>You!</i>

<i>- Leo!
What?</i>

<i>I was waiting for a good spot to jump in,
but they just kept blabbity-blab-ing.</i>

<i>There it is! That's the key.</i>

<i>Get them! Don't let them
interfere with the ceremony!</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>It started!</i>

<i>He's unlocking the doorway!
We need to get up there right now!</i>

<i>Casey, go. We've got you covered.</i>

<i>Oh no.</i>

<i>Oh.</i>

<i>Oh no! They're here!</i>

<i>Then let's make sure
their visit's short and sweet.</i>

<i>I'm finally free!</i>

<i>The people of this planet
will pay for what they've done to me.</i>

<i>Welcome to Earth.
I hope you don't enjoy your stay!</i>

<i>Oh!</i>

<i>Enough tricks!</i>

<i>Mikey! Donnie! No!</i>

<i>No...</i>

<i>Raph, what happened to our powers?</i>

<i>They... They're gone.</i>

<i>What did they do to us?</i>

<i>Brother, sister, join me.</i>

<i>Time for us to finish remaking
this universe in the image of Krang.</i>

<i>How I've waited for this day.</i>

<i>Indeed.</i>

<i>Brother, widen the portal
and retrieve our ship, the Technodrome.</i>

<i>Once it is here,
this world will kneel before us.</i>

<i>Oh, if you two don't mind,
I haven't killed anything in ages.</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>Retreat!</i>

<i>Retreat? We don't retreat!</i>

<i>Leo, for once, listen to me.
They're too powerful and Dad's hurt.</i>

<i>You don't understand.</i>

<i>If we don't close that doorway,
it's only gonna get worse.</i>

<i>Raph?</i>

<i>I'm not gonna argue with you, Leo!
Donnie, escape pods, now!</i>

<i>You don't have to tell me twice!</i>

<i>Sensei, we need to get that key!</i>

<i>Leo!</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

<i>Raph?</i>

<i>Raph, wait, no.</i>

<i>Wait, Raph! Raph! No, Raph!
Raph! No, Raph!</i>

<i>Escape pods incoming.</i>

<i>Congratulations
on surviving, fam.</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

<i>Oh, I hate that.</i>

<i>Everyone okay? Anybody hurt?</i>

<i>How did we get here?</i>

<i>Donnie pods.
We've never had to use those before.</i>

<i>So, how would everyone
rate their escape experience?</i>

<i>"Very satisfied," "Very, very satisfied,"
"Extremely satisfied"?</i>

<i>- Donnie!
Sorry. Sorry.</i>

<i>Data collection calms me down.</i>

<i>Splints.</i>

<i>This is terrible! Why did we leave?</i>

<i>In case you didn't notice,
we were getting our butts kicked!</i>

<i>But my mission was to stop them!</i>

<i>Now, the Krang are using that key</i>

<i>to bring in something
that will destroy the world.</i>

<i>We lost.</i>

<i>Oof.</i>

<i>- Where's my other pod?
Where's Raph?</i>

<i>Ah, did you know this would happen?
Why didn't you tell me?</i>

<i>- What are you talking about?
Easy!</i>

<i>- Leo, what's going on? Where's Raph?
Leo, what happened to Raph?</i>

<i>Leonardo?</i>

<i>They...</i>

<i>They got him.</i>

<i>You left Raph?</i>

<i>He left himself.</i>

<i>He used his pod to save me, all because
I went after this stupid thing.</i>

<i>You got it! Nice.</i>

<i>"Nice"? They captured Raph!</i>

<i>He's from the future!
He knew this would happen!</i>

<i>No, I didn't.
This didn't happen in my time.</i>

<i>We changed the past, and you got the key.</i>

<i>That means there's
still a chance to stop them.</i>

<i>- No, we have to save Raph. Come on.
Leo, wait.</i>

<i>If you won't come, I'll go myself.</i>

<i>- We've lost our mystic powers.
We don't have a plan!</i>

<i>We don't need a plan.</i>

<i>"I'm the greatest ninja
the world's ever seen," his words.</i>

<i>Shouldn't we talk about this</i>

<i>before we run off all half-cocked,
willy-nilly, pell-mell?</i>

<i>I keep being told
I'm doing this hero thing wrong.</i>

<i>But I got the key, didn't I?</i>

<i>I get results,
so now we're doing it my way.</i>

<i>My son, listen to your team.</i>

<i>This is not about you.</i>

<i>They made it about me
when they took my brother.</i>

<i>Trust me, I got this.</i>

<i>Donnie, you're driving.</i>

<i>What do we do with this?</i>

<i>We can't just bring it with us,
but we can't just leave it behind.</i>

<i>Then we should destroy it.</i>

<i>Splints and I will stay here
and take care of business.</i>

<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

<i>Thanks, Commander O'Neil.</i>

<i>"Commander"? I like the sound of that.</i>

<i>Oh, look at it.</i>

<i>Disgusting.</i>

<i>Try looking in a mirror.</i>

<i>Ugh, it's talking at me.</i>

<i>I'm going to rip out its tongue.</i>

<i>Forgive my sister.</i>

<i>She's got a bit of a temper.</i>

<i>And being in prison for a thousand years
hasn't done her any favors.</i>

<i>You're not human.</i>

<i>What are you?</i>

<i>Let me go, and I'll show you.</i>

<i>Hmm.</i>

<i>You're more powerful
than the people of this planet,</i>

<i>yet you defend them.</i>

<i>- Why?
It's my duty.</i>

<i>A word used by the weak.</i>

<i>Many planets before yours
have spoken of duty.</i>

<i>They too have been consumed by the Krang.</i>

<i>And now our glorious crusade continues</i>

<i>to restore the natural order of things.</i>

<i>The strong will devour the weak.</i>

<i>Last I checked,</i>

<i>we weren't the ones locked in a
prison dimension for a thousand years.</i>

<i>That's called "trash talk."</i>

<i>A rare misstep.</i>

<i>Once I retrieve the key
from your comrades,</i>

<i>I will bring forth the mighty Technodrome,</i>

<i>and you will witness
the true power of the Krang.</i>

<i>Now, where have they taken my key?</i>

<i>It won't tell you anything.</i>

<i>Let me kill it.</i>

<i>Lady brain face here is right.
I'm not telling you jack.</i>

<i>You don't have to tell me.</i>

<i>I'll look myself.</i>

<i>There it is.</i>

<i>They always do it the hard way.</i>

<i>Our brother and I will secure
a location for the dimensional doorway.</i>

<i>Take these soldiers
and retrieve me my key.</i>

<i>We live to serve.</i>

<i>You will serve me whether you live or not.</i>

<i>What is this thing?</i>

<i>Hold on to your gluteus maximi!</i>

<i>The Turtle Tank, baby!
It's how we roll in the past.</i>

<i>I mean, the present. I mean...</i>

<i>- Ugh! Time travel's confusing.
They're on the move.</i>

<i>According to the subcutaneous tracker
I put on Raph...</i>

<i>Wait, does that mean
you put trackers on all of us?</i>

<i>"No"?</i>

<i>No, of course I did...Â n't.</i>

<i>Based on their trajectory,
they're headed...</i>

<i>...to the tallest building in the city.</i>

<i>That's right, Metro Tower.</i>

<i>I heard the story so many times as a kid,
but I never thought...</i>

<i>"And behold,</i>

<i>from their perch atop New York City,
the Krang ripped open the sky itself."</i>

<i>"What came out was terror,</i>

<i>and what rained down upon us
was worse than death."</i>

<i>They told that to kids?</i>

<i>Man, the future is harsh.</i>

<i>I'm not gonna let that happen.</i>

<i>We need to get into Metro Tower
without being spotted.</i>

<i>We'll take the subway tunnels.</i>

<i>Subway tunnels don't offer much
in the way of an escape if we need it.</i>

<i>- Are you sure about this?
Yeah, maybe we should...</i>

<i>Guys, we're doing it my way. Remember?</i>

<i>Hm?</i>

<i>Prepare the site so we may
bring forth the Technodrome.</i>

<i>Yes, brother.</i>

<i>See? Smooth sailing.
We'll have Raph in no time.</i>

<i>I hope he's okay.</i>

<i>How are we gonna find him
once we get there?</i>

<i>I have a lot of questions
regarding "once we get there."</i>

<i>Relax. We'll do what we always do.
Ninja in, ninja their faces, ninja out.</i>

<i>That's exactly how you freed all those
families from the Krang labor camp.</i>

<i>Yeah, that sounds like me.</i>

<i>In the future,
you guys are beyond amazing.</i>

<i>The mystic powers you're able
to harness are on a whole other level.</i>

<i>Of course! What about my future?</i>

<i>I'm expecting big things for me.</i>

<i>How many Nobel prizes do I have?
Don't tell me. I wanna be surprised.</i>

<i>Donnie, you were the most brilliant,
innovative mind of all time.</i>

<i>I'm shocked, I am.
Go on, continue to meet my expectations.</i>

<i>What do I do in the future?</i>

<i>You are the most powerful mystic warrior
the world has ever known.</i>

<i>With those two hands,
you sent me back in time.</i>

<i>Wow!</i>

<i>Actually,
there is something I should tell you.</i>

<i>Auto brake engaged.</i>

<i>Huh.</i>

<i>Wow.</i>

<i>Think we're in the right place?</i>

<i>Looks like the Metro Tower station
is on the other side of those vines.</i>

<i>Great. Let's hoof it.</i>

<i>Through the disgusting,
drippy slime jungle?</i>

<i>I know. I know. Leo knows best,</i>

<i>but I'm not sharing my hand sanitizer.</i>

<i>Feeling a lack of rush
in this rush hour,Â right?</i>

<i>I don't know, Leo.
Something feels...</i>

<i>off.</i>

<i>Don't worry. I won't let us die.
I'm a mystic warrior.</i>

<i>"I feel better already,"
he said without a hint of sarcasm.</i>

<i>Look, the stairs.</i>

<i>Sneaking in from below was the right move.
Those slimeballs will never see us coming.</i>

<i>We tried to jackhammer it,
flamethrower it, pour acid on it...</i>

<i>I thought lasers cut everything!
How did that not work?</i>

<i>There's not even a scratch!</i>

<i>Maybe it was your aim.</i>

<i>Maybe your big rat head got in the way!</i>

<i>Mmm, I'll show you, fat rat head.</i>

<i>Okay, deep breaths.</i>

<i>You said some things, I said some things.</i>

<i>Maybe we should just
get back to saving the world.</i>

<i>What's next?</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

<i>This cannot be good.</i>

<i>April O'Neil!</i>

<i>Come back here!</i>

<i>Faster.</i>

<i>Faster!</i>

<i>I knew this was a bad idea.</i>

<i>Leo, there's too many. We should go back.</i>

<i>No, we're gonna get to those stairs.</i>

<i>Leo, we're not gonna make it!
We have to turn back.</i>

<i>We push forward, get Raph, that's final.</i>

<i>Mystic hands!</i>

<i>Donnie! Mikey!</i>

<i>Oh no, Donnie, your soft shell!
You're exposed!</i>

<i>We gotta find shelter!</i>

<i>Oh, oh, keep it down, Vomitello!</i>

<i>Oh. Keep it down, daddy!</i>

<i>Run, insects, but you can't escape!</i>

<i>Don't!</i>

<i>The key, human! Give it to me!</i>

<i>Ah!</i>

<i>What did you do to me?
What did you do to my face?</i>

<i>Ha!</i>

<i>I knew that stuff was nasty! I told y'all!</i>

<i>Yes, yes, you're a genius. Let's go.</i>

<i>Ah!</i>

<i>Donnie, come in.</i>

<i>They found us. Where should we go? Donnie?</i>

<i>We're trapped.</i>

<i>We are trapped
in the subway under Metro Tower.</i>

<i>The tank is running on emergency power</i>

<i>and is covered
in some kind of Krang bio-growth.</i>

<i>- I repeat...
April, come quick!</i>

<i>We're getting squished!</i>

<i>We're on our way!</i>

<i>But, April, how will we get them out?</i>

<i>I've got an idea.</i>

<i>Yeesh.
Remind me to never get on your bad side.</i>

<i>Casey!</i>

<i>Casey, you okay?</i>

<i>Donnie, Mikey, anybody?</i>

<i>Ah!</i>

<i>What the heck was that?</i>

<i>Some kind of drippy, crazy Krang monster.</i>

<i>No, I mean you!
Why weren't you listening to anybody?</i>

<i>Because I was trying to get us
into the building!</i>

<i>That sure worked out well.</i>

<i>I was doing everything right.
How could it go wrong?</i>

<i>Because you weren't
listening to your team!</i>

<i>You don't have
all the answers all the time!</i>

<i>I'm the greatest ninja
the world's ever seen. You said that.</i>

<i>I was wrong.</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>You're impulsive, you're arrogant,</i>

<i>and you don't see that every decision
you make could cost someone their life.</i>

<i>You want to know what really happens
to your brothers in the future?</i>

<i>They die.
Everybody dies fighting the Krang.</i>

<i>The world needs Master Leonardo.</i>

<i>And all we got is this guy.</i>

<i>We have an update
on the strange situation at Metro Tower.</i>

<i>All contact has been lost
with those inside the building,</i>

<i>and conflicting reports suggest</i>

<i>something is barricading entrance
for emergency personnel.</i>

<i>Fools.</i>

<i>These creatures should
welcome the power of the Krang.</i>

<i>You on the rooftop!
Stop and surrender immediately!</i>

{\an8}<i>We've got eyes on the roof top
where the police are confronting...</i>

{\an8}<i>What is that?</i>

<i>You may begin.</i>

{\an8}<i>Oh look! Okay! Wait!</i>

<i>Look out!</i>

<i>Mmm.</i>

<i>Look,</i>

<i>I know I'm not the Leo you knew
in the future, and maybe I never will be.</i>

<i>This whole time
I was sure my family needed me,</i>

<i>but the truth is I need them.</i>

<i>If we're gonna survive this,
we have to do it together.</i>

<i>Hull integrity, 4%.
Breach imminent. Good luck.</i>

<i>Whew, good.
We have an imminent amount of time.</i>

<i>"Imminent" means "soon," Mikey.</i>

<i>Don't worry.
I'll save us with my mystic hands.</i>

<i>Ah?</i>

<i>Casey must have been wrong about me.</i>

<i>This is it, Donnie.</i>

<i>We're gonna get crushed!</i>

<i>- Knock-knock!
April?</i>

<i>Anyone order a rescue?</i>

<i>Boom goes the herbicide!</i>

<i>April!</i>

<i>You saved us!</i>

<i>Uncomfortable with emotion!</i>

<i>Where is Leo? And, uh, Future Boy?</i>

<i>Somewhere in there.</i>

<i>Faster! They're this way.</i>

<i>I can smell them.</i>

<i>She found us! We gotta move now.</i>

<i>Oh man,
is this what the future looks like?</i>

<i>Nope, the future is worse. Much worse.</i>

<i>Donnie, Mikey, do you read me?</i>

<i>Come in, Leo.</i>

<i>Donnie, where are you?</i>

<i>We've extracted from the subway
and are ascending a staircase.</i>

<i>I'm getting a lot of interference,
but if you hold still,</i>

<i>I can triangulate your position
using a complex geo-location algorithm.</i>

<i>- Uh, Donnie?
Odd numbers, primes, no... almost.</i>

<i>Almost!</i>

<i>Ugh. I never get to use my algorithm.</i>

<i>Man, I am so glad you guys aren't dead.</i>

<i>Ditto.</i>

<i>Okay, before this gets too mushy,
we need to locate Raph.</i>

<i>Can you tell me if he's in the building?</i>

<i>Bet your momma's
subatomic particles I can.</i>

<i>Got him! He's close.</i>

<i>He's almost on top of us.</i>

<i>Wait, he is on top of us.</i>

<i>Raph!</i>

<i>Quick, cut him down, get him out of there.</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

<i>Hang on. We got you. Almost there.</i>

<i>Raph?</i>

<i>Ah.</i>

<i>Surprise.</i>

<i>What did you do to my brother?</i>

<i>Improved him.</i>

<i>Thank you for this.
We will be putting it to good use.</i>

<i>Come, the world awaits destruction.</i>

<i>Tear them apart!</i>

<i>We gotta move.</i>

<i>- Leo, move!
No!</i>

<i>A shame our brethren
didn't survive the prison dimension.</i>

<i>Then again, their weakness
has no place in my new Krang empire.</i>

<i>Open and bring unto this world</i>

<i>the mighty power of Krang!</i>

<i>Warning! This is a warning!</i>

<i>...appears to be something
falling from the sky...</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>Oh!</i>

<i>Begin!</i>

<i>What do we do now?</i>

<i>I fear we are lost.
The Krang are too powerful.</i>

<i>Maybe we could
change the future some other way.</i>

<i>Guys, it's time to face facts.
We can't change the future.</i>

<i>Says who?</i>

<i>Says the grandfather paradox,
says physical determinism,</i>

<i>says the space-time continuum.</i>

<i>Look, I didn't want it to be true, but...</i>

<i>...science.</i>

<i>That's it! Donnie's wrong.</i>

<i>The world is ending,
yet the barbs continue.</i>

<i>Don't you remember?
We already did change the future.</i>

<i>Raph never got kidnapped and
turned into a Krang zombie in your time.</i>

<i>- Right, Casey?
No, he didn't.</i>

<i>- That means we did change the future!
We're just in a different...</i>

<i>Bifurcated time branch?</i>

<i>Yes, yes, yes, that nerd thing.</i>

<i>You know what that means, right?
We still have hope!</i>

<i>A ninja's greatest weapon.</i>

<i>Hey, I like that!</i>

<i>Look, I'm done
thinking I have all the answers.</i>

<i>I don't know how to beat the Krang,</i>

<i>but I do know our future
isn't written until we write it as a team.</i>

<i>So what do we got?</i>

<i>Maybe...</i>

<i>Maybe we don't have to beat them.</i>

<i>Can't we just send them
back to the prison dimension?</i>

<i>There's an idea! Donnie, what do those
big, beautiful eyebrows have to say?</i>

<i>If we got control of their ship,
we could send it back through the portal.</i>

<i>Yes! Yes! Now we're cooking. Who else?</i>

<i>If someone on the ground
can get to that key...</i>

<i>We can close the doorway.</i>

<i>And then bye-bye Krang forever, baby!</i>

<i>Exactly. What do you say, Donnie?
You ready to fly a space ship?</i>

<i>Literally the greatest question
I have ever been asked.</i>

<i>All right, team, we have a plan.
Let's go save the world.</i>

<i>Wait, but what about Raph?</i>

<i>That big jerk may be
covered in goo and half alien,</i>

<i>but he's still our brother,
and I'm not giving up on him.</i>

<i>I'm not leaving him behind.</i>

<i>There's the key. Let's go.</i>

<i>Like Casey said, let's go!</i>

<i>I wish my tech was working!</i>

<i>Usually, my cardio is jet pack-assisted.</i>

<i>I'm not getting credit
for any of these steps!</i>

<i>Eugh.</i>

<i>Hey, question,
is itÂ too late to join April's team?</i>

<i>Sh.</i>

<i>You two figure out
how to hijack this ship.</i>

<i>I'm gonna find Raph.</i>

<i>So how do we hack this thing?</i>

<i>Best guess, main console?</i>

<i>Unfortunately, it'socupado.</i>

<i>Uh, new plan.</i>

<i>Run!</i>

<i>Surprise. I've come for my brother.</i>

<i>Let me guess.</i>

<i>Duty.</i>

<i>He said doodie.</i>

<i>I see you got yourself an upgrade.</i>

<i>You'll pay for what you have done to me!</i>

<i>This psycho routine is a little thin.
Where's the character development?</i>

<i>Leo's counting on us
to get to that key.</i>

<i>I think I have an idea.</i>

<i>Cover me!</i>

<i>Raph, you're coming with me,
whether you like it or not.</i>

<i>I don't want to fight you,
but I will if I have to.</i>

<i>Oh, you will have to.</i>

<i>Bravo, Mikey!</i>

<i>There's no buttons,
or computers, or anything.</i>

<i>Just a lot of drippy,
ooey-gooey disgustingness.</i>

<i>I don't know how to hack in...</i>

<i>Oh God, I know what I have to do.</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>No, I don't think I can do this.</i>

<i>What are you talking about?</i>

<i>Oh no!</i>

<i>That's... so gross!</i>

<i>- I can't do it.
I believe in you!</i>

<i>- No, it's my worst nightmare.
I know.</i>

<i>I'm doing it!Â I'm doing it!</i>

<i>Raph, I know you're in there somewhere.
You've gotta snap out of this!</i>

<i>Do you feel what
the power of the Krang can do?</i>

<i>I am saving this weak planet!</i>

<i>I am a gift!</i>

<i>It's not working.
I need more of a connection.</i>

<i>Mikey, take off my battle shell.</i>

<i>No, you're too vulnerable
with just your soft shell.</i>

<i>There's no time, hurry.</i>

<i>Donnie?</i>

<i>Mikey, I am...</i>

<i>a spaceship!</i>

<i>Oh! Ah!</i>

<i>I'm trying to save you, you idiot!</i>

<i>Why do you have to make things so hard?</i>

<i>Ah.</i>

<i>You want to keep coming at me?
Go ahead.Â I'm done fighting you.</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>No!</i>

<i>Finally, man and machine</i>

<i>entwixed in perfect bionic synergy!</i>

<i>How dare you desecrate Krang's ship!</i>

<i>Donnie, Mikey!</i>

<i>I don't want to fight anymore.</i>

<i>I was fighting you
because I didn't understand you,</i>

<i>but now I get it.</i>

<i>I always figured you were mad because
you didn't like the way I did things.</i>

<i>But when I see what's happening to you,</i>

<i>and what's happening to them...</i>

<i>I realized it wasn't about me.</i>

<i>You didn't yell because you were mad,
you yelled because you were scared.</i>

<i>It's scary to be responsible
for the lives you protect.</i>

<i>Your team... your family,</i>

<i>but we do it anyway
because that's what it means to be a hero.</i>

<i>If this is it,
I want you to know I finally understand.</i>

<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

<i>Raph, Raph, there you are! Come back!
Your family needs you.</i>

<i>- Leo?
Yes!</i>

<i>Mikey, Donnie, we can fight this.</i>

<i>Raph's doing it for us,
so we do it for him.</i>

<i>That alien jerk face thinks we're weak</i>

<i>because he hasn't seen what we can do...</i>

<i>when we fight together!</i>

<i>It's pointless to resist Krang.</i>

<i>Give up!</i>

<i>You will be consumed like
everyone else on this pathetic planet!</i>

<i>Fat chance.</i>

<i>We're not like
everyone else on this planet.</i>

<i>We are...</i>

<i>...the Teenage...</i>

<i>- ...Mutant...
...Ninja...</i>

<i>...Turtles!</i>

<i>If this isn't the poster shot,
someone's getting fired.</i>

<i>Oh, we are not done yet.</i>

<i>April O'Neil!</i>

<i>That's payback.</i>

<i>Keep her under that building
until I bring it down.</i>

<i>Yeah!</i>

<i>Casey, get out of there!</i>

<i>Commander O'Neil!</i>

<i>Nice shot.</i>

<i>Donnie's almost got the ship to
the other side. I have to get to the key.</i>

<i>See ya.</i>

<i>Come in, Sensei, it's Casey.
Can you hear me?</i>

<i>Come in, Sensei! Can you hear me?</i>

<i>Ya!</i>

<i>Ah!</i>

<i>Okay! Donnie!</i>

<i>Cowabunga!</i>

<i>Flip-o-rama!</i>

<i>Let's roll.</i>

<i>Ka-zoom!</i>

<i>Raph, go.</i>

<i>On it!</i>

<i>Gotcha! Don't worry, Donnie!</i>

<i>This is not a hug. It's a rescue!</i>

<i>Where are we? Staten Island?</i>

<i>Oh, gross.</i>

<i>So how would everyone rate
that rescue experience? Unsatisfied?</i>

<i>Very unsatisfied?
Wish Donnie would have done it? Um-hum?</i>

<i>Donnie.</i>

<i>Leo's still up there.</i>

<i>Casey. Casey, come in.</i>

<i>Sensei, I'm here.
And I've got eyes on the key.</i>

<i>Tell me when you're home free,
and I'll pull the plug.</i>

<i>Casey, listen to me.</i>

<i>When I get to the other side,
you close that door.</i>

<i>What? Sensei, no!</i>

<i>Casey, it's the only way.
He's too strong.</i>

<i>He's not gonna stay on the other side
unless I keep him there.</i>

<i>There has to be another way!</i>

<i>We tried everything, Case.
This is the only way.</i>

<i>Leo, please don't do this! Leo!</i>

<i>You're one to talk, big bro.
Hero moves are totally your style.</i>

<i>Outmatched and alone, yet you persist.</i>

<i>For what?</i>

<i>Honor, redemption?</i>

<i>Sacrifice? All meaningless.</i>

<i>We'll see about that.</i>

<i>Leo, please!
I can't lose you again.</i>

<i>Hey, future me would be real
proud of you.Â I'm proud of you.</i>

<i>Weak words, weak actions.</i>

<i>I have forever known
what you fail to understand,</i>

<i>strength always prevails!</i>

<i>What you fail to understand
is I missed on purpose.</i>

<i>No, enough of your little tricks.</i>

<i>Casey, close the portal now.</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>No! Let go of me!</i>

<i>Casey, please.</i>

<i>You've been portal chopped.</i>

<i>You...</i>

<i>You've ruined everything!</i>

<i>And now... my wrath
will be reserved for you alone.</i>

<i>You think you've won,
you wretched little pest?</i>

<i>Wipe that grin off your face!</i>

<i>Mikey, it's over.</i>

<i>Leo never gave up on us.</i>

<i>I'm not giving up on him.</i>

<i>Whoa. Mikey,
whatever you're doing, don't stop!</i>

<i>We're here,Â Mikey. Together.</i>

<i>Took you guys long enough.</i>

<i>Leo!</i>

<i>Huh?</i>

<i>- Leo?
Hey.</i>

<i>Eww! Are we in Staten Island?</i>

<i>- Come here!
Aww!</i>

<i>No pictures.</i>

<i>So this is "grabbing a slice"?</i>

<i>I don't get it.</i>

<i>Wait for it.</i>

<i>Mmm.</i>

<i>So much better than rats!</i>

<i>- Mm-hmm.
Hey.</i>

<i>Hey, the rest of the world we saved
is pretty great too.</i>

<i>All right, everybody, look up here.</i>

<i>April, you just got a message
from someone named "Cassandra."</i>

<i>Whoa!</i>

<i>Looks like our friend Cassandra
has been busy.</i>

<i>That's my mom!</i>

<i>There goes the space-time continuum.</i>

<i>You did it, little brother.</i>

<i>You really did it.</i>

<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

<i>This wasn't about me.</i>

<i>It was about all of us
doing what needed to be done</i>

<i>because we're heroes.</i>

<i>You said "heroes."</i>

<i>There it is, gentlemen, our home.</i>

<i>What a town.</i>

<i>Beautiful.</i>

<i>And if it needs defending,
we'll always rise to the challenge.</i>

<i>Speaking of which,
you know what challenge I'm gonna rise to?</i>

<i>- Beating that record!
Yay!</i>

<i>No way! No, okay, fine.</i>

<i>All right, Big Raphie, let's do it!</i>

<i>Raph! Raph! Raph! Raph!
Raph! Raph! Raph! Raph! Raph!</i>
