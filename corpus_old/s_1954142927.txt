We ask pregnant women
and men already erect

kindly leave the room.

I'm crazy

I twisted ideas

There's something wrong

In my head

I'm a pervert, baby

What you will see

can set you free.

But beware!
This is a tale

naked woman

unbridled male desires,

witchcraft bloody

and sex!

Dead

Freedom

I arrived in town
late last night

Not a single girl in sight

All day, I wanted to race

But I did flee
all the beauties

They threw me, thrown, thrown

Hello. Brocktonville you go to?

I do not know. I'm not here.

I go to Desert Range.

This is my way.
Super.

Take that, little viper!
Leave me alone!

Get off me!

Watch out for your ass.

I'll keep an eye on,
you can be sure.

Look good,
because I'm out.

Let me go.
You got a nice ass,

but it will not prevent you
receiving a good spanking!

I tasted a lot of melons
in my life,

and damaged fruit
never deterred me.

Can I?

I beg you.

You matches
in the glove box?

Do not open it!

But it is disgusting!

I'm sorry.
You're a pervert?

No!
But the journey was long and ...

Kind of sick!
Stop this car.

It must change!
He told me it would change!

Farm, wanker!
Rather fall on a serial killer!

Not surprising
that you like overripe fruit.

You're as rotten as them.

That's enough.

Listen to me:
my son came to see me.

It should not doubt
what is happening here.

Your son, I do not care.

If it takes you, it's a nase.
Here it is.

Active now.

If you talk, I will show you
what I'm capable of.

You know what, Hezekiah?
You got that out of the mouth,

you're just ...

Deflated your tire.

Should have it checked.

It's good to see you, Dad.

It seems to me that the last time
that is crossed, it was ...

A mom's funeral.

And the time when it was seen
before a porn cinema.

An annoying hair.

That is true.
But all this is behind us.

I'm in college.
I turned the page.

Congratulations, son.

Since you stay here all summer,
you will not be unemployed.

Tomorrow
I put you to work.

I'll show you your room.

There is a good bodybuilder in town?

Speaking of body ...

My eyes have flourished.

There had to be a miracle,
this night.

They took good 15 cm.

You must be James.

James, here is Cheryl.

It does not replace your mother,

but it fills me
very differently.

I hope that my presence
will not bother you.

We will spend a great summer.

College, it is the foot.

I had to get used to the campus
and life in a new city,

but New Orleans is top.

Cultural life,

music

gastronomy ...

I can not wait to return. This year,
I will not be blue.

What do you study?

Next semester,
I'll ecology,

chemistry,

study of the evolution
human health,

Religious Studies A sia,

story ...

Hydropower and ...

the Navy.

And also Hebrew lessons ...

And I'll volunteer

in a center
for troubled youth.

It's a beautiful package.

I thought
a friend accompany you.

How's it going,
with chicks?

I've never had much luck
with the girls, but ...

I think it will change.

I'm sorry!

It does not matter.

Stronger, Hezekiah, stronger!

Fuck me!

What's my name?
Hezekiah.

My date of birth?
June 8, 1924.

The capital of Maryland?

Baltimore, Hon!

You must be thirsty. Want.

Thank you.

You've worked hard
since this morning.

Take a break, come lunch.

There is too much to do.

We barely started closing.
We'll eat later.

I do not say no
for something to munch on.

James, I told you ...
Come on, Hezekiah!

Do not overwork,

otherwise it will be good for nothing.

Well, okay.

But hurry.

You know what they say:

a loaf is better than two ...

Men
can not be feminists

because of societal norms.

Look at that!

Your father loves canned.

It would a platypus
canned if he found one.

There platypus
in New Orleans, James?

No. I think
that there is in Australia.

Give me your hand.

Obey.

Here, like this.

Smoothly.

Well, well ... a cherry.

There is a little slut
will be delighted.

A taste you now.

You bread?
Because eating with your fingers ...

No.

Lesson number 2.

Tire language.

Come on, what! Shows it to me.

Go ahead and eat.

Come on. I prepared a picnic.

It's been
my father and you ...

We live together? Few months.

You like it?

You're really a baby.

It's just that ...

I'm getting
feelings for you.

I know it's wrong.

You underpants bubbling,
that's what you feel.

Watch out.

Viewing.

A honeycomb.

Attention.
Do not approach.

Leave the nest. This is dangerous.

Put it down.

Jam,
it was just an appetizer.

That's the main course.

A table, darling.

Good for you!

That's what happens when you touch
the nest of others.

His head like a balloon.

Shut up, woman!

It's your fault that he is there.

It makes us lose
a half-day's work,

the time the swelling.

I could not guess
he was allergic.

It's not his fault, Dad.
I'll be more careful.

You better.

Be thankful you do not
falling on a rattlesnake.

Next time,
you will not get out alive.

What I want
start today

is the construction
the south end of the ranch.

Then we build a corral.

You have not lied, we will toil.

In fact, dad,
I think we have rats.

I heard in my room.

The little bastards!

Far
the house was spared.

They should come to my studio.

I set traps.

Your studio?

The place where I work.

Come, I'll show you.

Chlingue it!

What is it?

A slaughterhouse?
Quite the opposite!

Here, I give life to things.

Women laid bare.

Since when are you an artist?

After the death of your mother,
the insurance money

helped me realize
the dream of my life.

It is a real eye?

Initially, I worked
with beef jerky.

It does not rot
and it is very malleable.

But what we gain in flexibility
variety is lost,

in style, texture.

Anyone know what you do?

They know.

The so-called critical
wrote about my art

pen dipped in their bile.

Do you realize,

one of them had the nerve
calling me crazy!

This sculpture,

this masterpiece,

I'll dedicate.

I called

Ophelia.

Once finished the corral,

I'll livestock.

I have no further expenditure
from the food.

You think I could
eligible for a grant?

I do not know what they teach you,

but when two men argue,

they look straight in the eye.

We did not teach me
to be a man.

It was not
program this semester.

It should have.

You'd have needed it.

The kids
learn it at home.

When they had a father.

Strip parasites unemployed!
And you? You never worked.

You're just exhausted mom.

Leave your mother out!

If she could see you,
she would die ... again!

Well, let's talk.

She died how, exactly?

Drops. I go to the garage.

Do not come late.

This road is not safe at night.

It gauze?

Yes, and you?

Top relax.

If you could look at my car.

It may need
new tires.

Beautiful case.

I polishes?
Excuse me?

Your cash.

The covers are in need
of some polish.

You have understood what?

You might take a look
and encrypt my work?

No ... Today,
I have no time.

You have no other car.
If I come back in an hour ...

Bother me
when I have a customer!

Back to work!

So, like I said,

I can not put me,
I have to leave one day.

Looking for a place to sleep?

And full, it is done?

You're not here, you.
No. I came to see my father.

Are you the son of Hezekiah?
You sleep at the ranch?

Yes, my father.

It is a well crazy bastard!

And super slut well croupée
who lives with him!

There is nothing like a little ...

weird?

No ...

Those who stay too long
Desert Range

have a nickname.

What nickname?
"Disturbed."

He thing there in the desert.

People become zarbis here.

Give me your keys.

Fresh meat.

I place you, sweetie?

Played well.

You passed by that?

I was at home manicure.

Among nudists?

Monte.
Move over.

Looks like you've seen a ghost.

I almost serve dinner
a rattlesnake.

Snakes eat not
men. It's too big.

You know something about snakes.

Normal, I grew up in Texas.

This is where you met daddy?
No. A Reno.

I worked as a dancer
and dragged him into the corner.

You're a stripper?

Do not take your airs.

We do what we can to survive.

When you've grown
in a caravan camp,

you have one desire: to shoot you.

I'm not here to fall
in a family melodrama.

I came
learn to be a man.

At your service.

What are you doing?

I see nothing!

Good God!

But what is she doing?

Slow ...

Damn, Cheryl!
You want to kill me or what?

If women
were made for driving

they have a brain
and no breasts!

At home.

What you did not care here?

You hunted squirrels
for your statues?

Coyotes.

The Indians called
illusionists.

As if scandalized,

disgusted, amused, disturbed,

chastised and humiliated

these prehistoric beasts beings.

For me, these pooches
feignasses are scabby.

I not give to eat
a chink.

Here it is! Stand still.

Vire me that gun!

We had scaring.

Whatever. It will not go away.

Yet have I thought traps.

Sacrilege!

How dare you make me a cuckold?

You, my own son!

The wrath of the Lord
come upon your souls!

It pasteurisera your blood,
dissolve your kidney

distil your intestines
to empty

any foul matter!

He be my witness!

Do not answer me!

I do not want to hear you!

You're a senile old!

You do not can get for you like that.

I know what I saw!

You can not do this to me.

Go back to bed, you son.

You've already done enough of that.

Hello, Dad.

What are you doing?
I'm working on a sculpture.

I finally dropped the damn coyote.

Sorry
for what happened with Cheryl.

I do not seek
find me an apology, but ...

I could not control myself.

It's hard to explain.

It's not your fault, James.

It is the devil who has worked.

Where is she?
Cheryl? She is gone.

She packed up that night.

Do not worry.
It will never return.

On my return,
I want the fence has advanced.

On the Job
OK, Dad.

Who's this fag?
The butler?

This is my son, James.

It helps me on the ranch.

This is correct?
It is where your apron?

Alicia!

Not you angry.

He did not look good beefy.

I want, thank you.

I imagine.
Nobody is going to hold you.

Testicles. 1.5 kg.
OK.

Liver. 8 kg.

Chicken drumsticks.
What is it you?

This is for the match on Sunday.

They had to deliver the cheese, too.

Lamb. 5 kg.

There are how many packets?

24.
Damn wood!

This is the last time
they deliver me like that.

I like sheep
such as women, plump.

I need to buy cattle.

A bit of everything.

And I can tell you that
I lésinerai not on merchandise.

I carry it all in your workshop?

No, I got it.

So make a break.

Are you serious?

You have worked hard. You deserve it.

Find yourself a corner in the shade
and relax.

But do not put your feet
in my workshop.

I am preparing a new exhibition.
This is a surprise.

So do not just bother me.

You have a beautiful ass!

You know what I like.

Down from the saddle,
I need sleep.

Hi, you. What is it?

You scared me.

Looking the money your father?
It does not give you enough?

I just came to get the key.
Go back to sleep.

I can not.

I'm too restless.

It opens what, this key?

Say it to me.
This will be our little secret.

Lie down again.

Come on, James. I'm like an egg.

Dure outside,

but if you touch me in the right place

I pour all over you.

Okay.

Listen:

meet me in the kitchen

in 5 minutes.

And we will make a lovely omelette.

Is that you, James?

Cheryl?

You're at the bottom, James.

It hurts!

Who did this to you?

Cheryl, listen to me!

Say something!

Why, son? Why?

I would ask you
exactly the same question.

It was a delightful being.

A good soul.

There's another in your workshop
covered in blood.

Can you explain me?

Cheryl?
Get rid of the bodies.

Are you kidding me?

You have to call the police!
No, not the police!

It is useless.

We will not get away.

These girls had family.
Someone will look.

You do not understand.
These girls were whores.

Two big fucking no friends.

They will not miss anyone.

You paid them to have sex with you?

It's like that.

They provided me services

in exchange for compensation.

A big compensation.

Money Mom served
to indulge your vices.

Will take shovels in the workshop.
Hurry.

I want to avoid jail you.

We solve this problem by family.

I promise we will come out.

I will not go to prison.
I have done nothing.

Me neither.
Why are you lying?

I tell the truth.
It is you who lie!

I have the impression that you think.

What freak is quite senile
to kill two women

and then forget?

As calibrated, like son, it seems.

Let us bury them.

Without a coffin?

Should although to puff.

Wait.

Just last respects.

Dad, you got something there.

Where?

I have clearer ideas
with a beautiful girl

at my side.

I'll go into town.
Certainly not.

This is how
our troubles began.

No more hookers for you.

I gotta get back to the garage.

Above all, keep quiet.

Hello?
The retirement home?

I have to admit my father
on the spot.

It is completely sick.

Dad! Leave the phone.

Hangs up.

I can bring?

No, health side, all is well.

But I think it kills
young prostitutes.

Dad!

I'm still online. Hangs up!

Take appointment.
No, I'm leaving.

When?
Today.

I send someone to evaluate it.
The estimate?

Tell me everything.

You just need to change the tires!
I must go myself.

You will not go far
From what I've found

under your hood.

You counted back in town?

Far from here.
You were right about this place.

You see what I mean?

This is a real failure or not?

If it's just a scheming
say it, get it over.

Relax and watch.

The problem is
the feed pump.

It is secured to the engine

pump ... and gasoline.

But not here.

If I can repair the injection,

gasoline burn better,

without emissions.

You understand?

Here, key.

I believe you.
It ready tomorrow.

I've never seen
small cute ass too.

Pretty box.

The frame goes with?

Or it is a luxury option?

The frame is sold separately.

The new models are better.

The car is new.

But no carbide
this kind of crap.

What do you want me?

I am your nurse.

What's going on?

Patricia Veros,
care center.

I demanded they send a man.

I look like a man?

I do not need a nurse.

I'm in great shape.
Fresh as a roach.

This is just a test.

You want to feel the goods?
Dad!

It does not take long.

Do not hurry.

No need to screw up the thing.

You're in shape.
I like bread.

Over time, I cured.

Perverse!

The Lord gave me hands
for they are activated.

I obey His will.

If God had wanted ...

While you are under this roof,

I forbid you to blaspheme.

Shut up and impale yourself on me.

Hide me this stuff!

So what did you do
these girls?

Why should I have killed?
Still, they served to me.

All men have their hobby.
Should choose bowling.

Hold.

Your filthy mind
end up in the gutter.

Oral examination.

Go ahead, chat!
I do not babes.

A little taste?

This is better than your tuft,
kind of bitch.

OK.

Two fried eggs, two!

Miss! I talk to you?

You were forced to burn?

It is not known
if he is really guilty.

Your father tried to rape me.

Better keep an eye on.

If nothing happens
in the coming days,

it will be fixed.

In the meantime, what do we do?

You always had
trouble with girls?

I meet,
but I can not ...

Sleep with them?

To begin a real relationship.

Sunset would be a good start.

I find it hard to believe.
You're so easygoing.

It stuck me a dirty label
that has followed me all my schooling.

It often happens
when a child is ahead.

I was a compulsive masturbator.

In high school,
I was called Super Wanker.

It's cute.

Hello image perverse.

I do not remember what it is,
a pervert.

Some hide this side
better than others.

Me for example, I am a lesbian.

I'm a little disappointed.
I thought you and me ...

Homosexuality is a choice.

Gays can tack
as they want, according to their desire.

I plan to go straight.

What I mean,
is that you can change its nature.

I did quite a few times.

Let's talk all night?
Talk?

You're adorable, James.

Where,
the gun is on the rack.

In case what?
Your father is attached.

If it is not the killer,
it means that the other still lurking.

The other?

A man ... or something.

Whatever.

What are we talking about?

Let's talk about what we love.
I begin.

Your favorite color?
Red.

Me is blue.
Your favorite sport?

Basketball.
The baseball.

If you had to destroy an entire people,
what would it be?

Asians. No, Filipinos.

I got you, damn!

Good morning.

We fell asleep last night.

It wrong?

You missed a nice fight.

We made rascality?
I was not drunk at this point.

That's not it. I made
attacked by something.

An animal?
Maybe.

It was like what?

I have not been able to see it.

It was long like that.

Good morning.
How you feel?

As in a Greek tragedy.

As an incompetent king
held by his traitorous son.

Sorry
being forced to hold you.

It's almost finished.

I heard gunshots.

What was the problem?

Patty shot something.
One thing that came into the house.

Maybe a coyote.

The Illusionist. Be careful, son.

It can capture your heart

but pray to God
he does not have your soul.

I did not know you were there.

We have a big problem.
Which one?

Must release my father.

It's not him
who killed those girls.

Okay. We detach later.

I must tell you something.

So do I.

You know I never
loved men:

too many muscles
and not enough curves.

But you make me feel the effect.
I can not resist.

I love you.

That's your problem?
There is really nothing.

Me too, I love you.

Is that true?

Patty, wait!

Who's there?

I know you're there.

Show yourself, demon!

Wait!

Calm down. I can explain everything.

I told you that I had seen a doctor
in New Orleans.

It was not a real doctor.

It does not bother me.

It was a sorcerer.

It was black magic.

Voodoo is common practice

since the 18th century, when slaves
found themselves in Beauregard Square.

Anyway, I went to see this type
and it gave me a lot.

He told me that women
find me irresistible

everybody

would want to fuck with me,
without me having to do anything.

Finished the galleys,
appointments troublesome

the loose evenings

to masturbate

in plastic
with engine oil.

But it was necessary compensation.

All women
who succumb to my charm

are victims
my male attributes.

It is only now
I understand.

Look at me.

Look at me!

And it will appear on Earth
as a phallus.

Be a mischievous,

stiff shaft

dissension ungodly.

Go back where you came from, Succubus!

In the infamous depths
hell!

I knew that my penis
would detach

and become an assassin.

I swear.

I can probably
sue.

Well ...

You hurt?

Your head tells me something.

Your curves, your shape ...

I know you?

It almost seems
you are the fruit of my flesh.

Come, my poor child.

Free me from these links.

Opens these treacherous handcuffs.

Give me back my freedom.

Go!

I spent a wonderful evening.

I want to finish
with this curse.

I will do what it takes to.

So listen:
you, you're dressed.

Then we attack this thing.

Like this
it will do more damage.

What you said still stands?

On your doctor? Yes.

No!

You said you loved me.

It was a killer cornered cock.

Then we'll talk, OK?

Right length, but too skinny.

Hi, buddy.

I did not mean to surprise you.

What are you doing here?
I brought your car.

You fall ill.

I typed my way so far
and you will not let me go?

You do not get the picture.

This is the shit here.
Should you dégagiez.

You pay my bill and I break.

I can not pay it.
This is not good.

This is bastard.

Go home
I will come and pay you tomorrow.

No, not you dig.

I came,

so if you have not sorrel,
I will have to pay otherwise.

How does it otherwise?

Let me think.

I do not stop thinking about you!

Let me go!

Take my car
and break you!

Do not worry, I'll let you go.

Once I have all discharged!

I'm not a fag on TV

just to repaint your stay.

I came smash your ass!

I'm suffocating.

My dick!

I'm suffocating!

Kind of sick!

Oh yes, it's good!

Fuck me.

Go on, all the way!

Fuck me, my dog.

What are you doing?

This is too deep!

I hate you!

You made me suffer all my life!

Now I know:
it is you, the pervert!

Do not cry.

You know
we will not leave.

Loose the tail, son.

She tries to bamboozle you.

"She"?
Yes.

This cock is a girl.

Right, sweetie?

A penis is male.

Revises your biology class.

Each type has two sexes.

This tail
sweat the X chromosome:

she is jealous,
venomous vain.

This is your problem:

not a girl you would recognize
to the way you masturbate.

Because
you know women, you?

With your dirty little whores

your sculptures and abject?

And what you did to Mom!

What are you accusing me?

Go ahead, spit your venom.

It itches since you got here.

Say, if you got the balls!

Do not move.

Mollo, the nurse.

I'm not a nurse.

I never put
feet to a doctor.

Who are you?

Species sick!

This disgusting thing killed
the only person I loved.

I'm crazy about you, James.

Cheryl was that I loved.

It was to be married
spring in San Francisco.

She took a job as a dancer.

And she met him.

She wanted to pluck.

It was supposed to be a great plane.

You've noticed anything.

Now you will pay.

I should have known

that you were a lesbian.

My dear, you're going to get into the bone.

Kill her.

Go to hell!

Dad, okay?

Do not your sissy.

This is a scratch.

I should have been a better father.

You know, I did not kill your mother.

The plane crashed
and there were survivors.

But your mother is mad.

She killed the survivors one by one
to eat.

I could not stop.
It forced me to look at.

I was next.

But devouring his last victim,

she choked.

It saved my life.

Talk about a life!

Haunted by nightmares,

I turned to art,

seeking comfort
among prostitutes.

Papa, forgive me.

I should believe you.

When you came,

I've changed.

I realized how
my life was empty without you.

I accused you
not to be a man.

However, it was me
that I needed to grow.

I love you, James.

So do I.

I mean:
I'm in love with you.

Kiss your old father,
I beg you.

A kiss for an old man

before dying.

Give it to Ophelia.

It will be a good breast.

As calibrated, like son.

Then you ...

Who wants a cocktail sausage?

When you arrive late
a barbecue,

it remains
as sausages cramées.

Good fireworks, Bastard!

Bitch! You killed Patty!

Six months later

James, I love you!

Be less kids!

The party starts.

Here we go.

What idiots!
Forget it.

I gotta go.

It's party
and the guys are counting on me.

A bit, James.

I chair the festival committee.

I need help.

And me?

I'm ready.

I can not wait.

Take me, James.

Frankly, I'd love to, but ...

you forget my curse.

We have already spoken.

It's been six months.

We went out
whole semester without problem.

It's over, all that.

You broke the curse.

Open the glove box.

What?

Opens, I tell you.

This is not a joke?
Not at all.

Trust me.

James! Is
that means ...?

I intended to offer you
after the party tonight.

But I'm ready.

Ready to start a new life.

With you.

I love you.
Me too.

Can I open it?

Course.

I hope it will you.

Thus, the monster lives ...

He breathes, he feels,

it kills,

but do not worry
the truth.

Looking good:

deep in your heart
the key is hidden

which will free you from sin.

For love, true love,

will always be the winner.

End
