"Scratch and win," my ass.

Have better luck
scratchin' my balls.

Man, will you quit doing that?

Man, you know the plan.

Get the big money.
Get out this joint.

Start my
own business.

Right?

Damn!
I ain't going back up there.

No, I'm not.

I hate this job.

Damn, Franklin.

You got to warn us
before you walk up like that.

He was scared.

Franklin, what you doing?
You need somethin'?

Looking for a body.

You know they have toe tags, right?
You could just look.

Who you looking for?

It's not a who.
I'm checking for freshness.

What part of dead is fresh?
You wouldn't understand, boy.

I've been workin' here since you
boys still crappin' in your Underoos.

And I'm gonna tell you something.

There's a lot more to death
than what meet the eye.

I was supposed to run this place.

Yeah. Bummer.

I wonder why that promotion
didn't go through.

Because of what I know.

Because of what they
don't wanna hear about.

All right, Franklin-
Yeah, we're gonna get out of here-

Wait. Sit down!

I don't expect y'all to have the ambition nor
the skills to understand where I'm coming from.

But I'm gonna tell you something:
my philosophy on life.

Listen up.
It's very important.

Let's see if you can keep up.
Death-

What is it good for?

Absolutely nothing.

Crazy. Retard.

Hello, Franklin.
How are you?

Manley, Davis, you slugs.

Why can't you be more like Franklin?

<i>Some primates spend years</i>
<i>chasing after the opposite sex.</i>

<i>Take the African bonobo.</i>
<i>Please.</i>

Don't do it, brother.

It's not worth it.

Learning anything?

Nothing I don't already know.

Where's my brother?
Doing his toilette.

Really?

You been working out, D?

Your arms are huge.

You know, I do what I can.

It's looking good.

Hey.
Hey.

What the hell you doing here?
You got fired from the Big & Tall?

Actually, I got promoted
to assistant manager, thank you.

We can get a discount on shit?
Yeah. If you were big or tall.

Just pick out your clothes, sweetie.

I worked all night,
if you must know.

Send down some of your homeboys.
I might be able to hook 'em up.

Yeah?
Yeah.

You should come down to the court.
I'll spread the word for you.

For real?
Uh-huh.

Wait a minute.

Don't tell me y'all entering
that streetball tournament again.

Yeah. It's gonna
be different this year.

You said that last year.

And the year before.
And the year before that.

So what you saying?
I'm just saying.

Damn.

Twenty-five thousand dollars, man?

We got to win this.
Just got to practice.

Motown, don't you think
for a three-on-three tournament...

there should be more
than just the two of us?

Yeah. I got it covered.
I heard that before, man.

Seriously, I got it covered this time.
For real. We gonna win this year.

I feel it.
Besides, I had a dream.

Egads! Whatever are you doing?

I told you to wax her,
not scrape her.

Here. Diapers.

Never rags. Continue.

Motown's Car Service.
It's all about class.

May I share with you my dream?

Ladies, ladies, ladies,
ladies, ladies!

Y'all lookin' so lovely.

Hey, you. Driver.

Eyes ahead, my man.

Now, where were we?

Hey!

Let me guess.
The tittie dream, right?

Yes.

No. It's unrealistic.

Man, them titties
was very realistic.

Fake, but very real.
Hey, there he go.

George?
George is our third.

Trust me.
Hey.

Hey.
What's up?

Nothing.

What's up, George?
It's hot out here, huh?

Why your yellow ass
speaking to me, man?

Why you got to be so hostile, man?

I'm just tryin' to talk
a little basketball business, that's all.

What you want, man?
It ain't what I want.

It's what I got.

Check it out.

I wanna ask you about that discount.
I wanna get six more of these.

I don't mean to break up the party,
but we got to do this now.

What?
I'm gonna do you later.

Yes!

Well, if it isn't
last year's last place.

Yeah. That was last year.

And the year before that.

I can't even spell "lose." You?

L-O-hell, no.

George.
You? Them?

Then show me what y'all got.

I ain't had a good laugh all day.

Check it up. Right here.
Y'all ready?

Go, go, go!
Pick it up!

Yeah! That was sick!

That's what I'm talkin' about.
Call the doctor, baby.

Y'all got 'em? Y'all ready?
Come on.

Big man! I got it!
Yeah!

Pay attention, man. Damn.
Don't worry. I'm ready.

Check the ball, baby.

Who's that?

She works at the club.

She way out
of your league, okay? Check up.

Hey! Hey! Hey!
He holdin'.

You're killing me.

You're killing me. It's some bullshit.
He holdin'!

It's some bullshit. I'm not fin to look
like a chump playing with y'all. I quit.

You can't quit, man. What about Sabrina,
right? You want Sabrina, right?

Y'all here playin' like Scooby
and Scrappy-fuckin'-doo.

You want Sabrina
to hook you up. What?

That's the best move
that fool had all day.

What you do that for?
I'm nobody's prize, Motown.

Are you crazy?
A little bit.

What were you thinking?
We needed a third.

As for you,
buy yourself a quesadilla, sucker.

Damn! Pimpin' your own sister.

Give me that two dollars.
You don't get nothing. Punk ass.

How you doing, bruh? Good?
You look good. You look good.

Not that you look good
like I like you like that.

You look good like-
as a strong black man.

If you just let us in,
we'll barely be in anybody's way.

You got us let us in.
Have you ever wanted somethin' so bad?

We have to get in this club.
Just for a little while. Please.

We just need to get in
just for a little bit. Please.

Just move the rope
and let us in.

All right?

Okay, step the fuck back. Now.

Do it.

Hello, ladies.

That's what I'm talking about.

Very good. Very good.

Back! Are you fucking with me?
Not even a little bit.

Get the fuck back.

All right, plan "B."

I know a busboy named Miguel.

He told me he'll get us in at 10:00
for 20 bucks.

Okay.
You bet.

You comfortable?
Actually-

Hey!

Hey.
Hi.

Didn't I see you
at the courts today?

Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

Playin' a little basketball.
Yeah.

It was you.
My name is Morris. Morris Davis.

My friends call me Motown.
I'm Tammy Dexter. My friends call me Tammy.

Nice to meet you, Tammy.
Hi.

Sorry.
That's okay.

So I haven't seen you
around here before.

I just moved down here from Oakland.
Oakland. Oaktown!

My cousin had a spot
in Echo Park, so I'm here.

I like Echo Park too.
It's cool.

Wait. Why are you in the alley?

Dropped my keys.

In a previous alley visit.

Uh-huh.

Yep.
Right.

Oh, my gosh! What's that?
Rat.

A rat that big?
Yes. L.A. The rats are huge out here.

Rat! Be quiet, rat!
Stop! Stop it! Be quiet!

Please, rat!
Stay quiet, rat!

Down! Rat, calm down!

Rat, down!

It's cool now.
It's cool?

Yeah.
Okay.

Do you wanna come in?
'Cause I can get you in the back way.

No. I would never-The back way?
Save you some money.

I'm cool, really.
I got it covered pretty much.

I'm gonna go back inside.
I just came out for some air.

That's cool.

Hope you find your keys.
Huh?

Your keys.
Oh, yeah. The keys. Stupid keys.

I'll try my best.

Wait. Tammy.

Hey. Why don't you call me sometime.

Yeah? Yeah.
I'll call you.

Okay.

I got to get back to work.

Okay.
Okay.

I'm gonna call her.

Yes!

What the fuck?

How are we supposed to get in now?

It don't matter.
Did you hear her? She said call me.

I heard.

What I didn't hear
is you getting her digits.

Damn! Why you ain't say nothing?

I was too busy being a rat.
Shut up.

Is that a roll?

Ask me if I want a roll, man.

You hear that?
It is kind of dark.

I don't like graveyard shift.

Yeah. Me neither.
Come on.

Hey, Motown.

Wake up.

Hey.

Motown.

What the fuck?
Where the hell we at?

Looks like the creepy and scary
morgue basement.

Let's check.

Franklin's crib.

Shit.

Dear Lord, don't take us now
while we're both in our prime.

At least one of us.

Man, I seen this happen
in too many scary movies.

I know. I know.

He's gonna tie your hands to the table and
your ankles to the Gremlin and drive away.

Or it's a little girl with long,
skanky hair over her face...

is gonna crawl out the TV
and bite your dick off.

Or there's gonna be a saw on the floor and
you're gonna have to cut through your own feet.

Why is all this happening to me?

'Cause while he's distracted with you,
I'm gettin' my black ass the fuck out of here.

You a selfish- I should've kicked
your ass off my couch-

I can hear every word
you fools are sayin'.

Get up.
Got work to do.

Franklin, people
know we down here, man.

Ain't nobody lookin' for you or you.

What you doing to my Gremlin?
Power source.

Couldn't get enough juice
from the panel.

I would've asked you, but-

Thought about the fact that I only consider
you a mere high-functioning retard.

Decided not to waste my time.

Today's y'all's lucky day.

Get up!

Y'all about to witness
a fuckin' miracle.

Look at him.

No friends.

No family.

Just tossed to the side
like yesterday's trash.

Hold this.
No, no, no.

Hold this, bitch!

What the fuck?

You, get over by the big man.

And you, go get them cables.

Franklin, this guy was dead
when you found him, right?

Technically.

But then I switched out
his busted heart for a brand-new one.

Franklin, man, that's crazy.

You can't give somebody
a heart transplant after they're dead.

Sure you can.
But that's not the hard part.

The heart.

Brain.

You sync 'em up.

Technically...

you got life.

You done this before.

Somewhat.

I almost had it last year...

and the year before that
and the year before that.

This year's gonna be
a little bit different.

Y'all ready to make history?

I'm ready to make number two
if you must know.

Y'all gonna be my witnesses.

Put them cables together.

Franklin, all right, let's just talk about this.
If I put-

Put them cables together!

Now, all you got to do, my friend,
is just breathe.

That's all you got to do.
Now it's time for the moment of truth.

Goddamn.

Man, he's lucky to be alive.

Him? What about me?
What about you?

If Franklin didn't black out,
he would've killed me.

Stop. Stop. Stop.

You, come here.
You.

I don't know. He want something.

I want something too.
You-

So what did Franklin want?
Nothing.

Nothing? Every time you say "nothing,"
it's about somethin'.

Girls. Money.

Weed.

I know that face.

It's weed.

Let's go.

Man, that graveyard shift's a bitch.

And I hope no one's beat us
to Franklin's weed.

Like who?

Let's just get it
and get the hell out of here.

He said it was behind the TV.

TV? I don't see any TV, man.

All I see is hands in jars
and some old Kool-Aid containers.

I don't see no damn TV.

I think he was fuckin' with us.

Damn.

What the hell are
you doing in the drawers?

I thought he may have
one of those little bitty TVs.

Oh, snap!

Look. It's like some kind of old-school
computer zapper.

Shazam.

Ain't that a bitch.

This is crazy.
Look at this. Damn.

This is way cool.
Is that the TV?

Man, that's a nice TV.

And it just got nicer.

Now, that's
some high definition.

We have no choice
but to take care of Franklin's shit.

'Cause he did say take care of his shit.
No choice.

He did ask very polite.
Very polite.

It'd be rude to make all this nice,
beautiful crib go to waste.

Why go to waste?
And I and you are in no condition to drive.

I'm fine.

Not in five minutes you won't be.

Wait. Where you going?
None of your business.

This is sharp, boy.

So what's up with Franklin, Jr?

Just leave him alone.
Shit, he ain't bothering nobody.

Damn.

Yeah, but what
if he gets all moldy and shit?

He already smells like a booty.

You think that's gonna help?
What the hell is that supposed to do?

You kiddin'?

I could go five days with just one sprinkle.
It's the Garden Fresh scent.

Hey.

Look like Franklin had a little bit more
going on than we thought.

Good idea.

Beer me, pimp.

To Franklin.
Yeah.

I think we should be called
the Super Hoopers.

You like that? Like-
Super-

Yeah. The Super Hoopers.
That's cool.

Yeah.
Yeah, I got some names too.

Oh, yeah? You believe, huh?

I believe, man.

<i>No foul. Game on.</i>
<i>Let's go. Come on.</i>

Man, that's just nasty.

What?
You just ripped one off.

Nah. No way, man.

Mine's have more of a nutty aroma.

Yeah, your farts
do be kind of nutty.

Yes, they are.

It's funny 'cause
you don't even eat nuts and shit.

Yeah, well, natural.

Come on, man.

I just felt the vibrations from that.

Nope. Once again, not me.

Maybe Franklin boy's
gone skanky after all.

Man, he not even there.
Stop blamin' shit on the dead.

Where you move him to?
Me?

What do I look like,
a monster magician?

I've been on the damn couch
the whole time.

I ain't move him nowhere.

If you ain't move him and I ain't
move him, where the hell he go?

You're so damn smart.

Unless-

Unless-

Unless-

Oh, shit.

Oh, Motown.
What?

Shit. We got to save the Gremlin.

We? That's not my Gremlin
about to get fucked up.

Give me that chicken.

Hey, give me back my delicious, crispy,
golden popcorn chicken.

Not unless you agree to help me save
the Gremlin.

All the rides I gave your ass.

Here's the plan.

We get in there.

We leave a trail of popcorn chicken,
leading away from the car.

We get in the Gremlin
and drive out and lock his ass in there.

Let's go.

Oh, shit!

Big as hell.

Come on, come on,
come on, come on! Faster!

Now, go.
Go, go, go, go.

Damn! What I tell you?
What I tell you?

<i>Listen to Motown</i>

Just what I told you. See?

Hey, man.
Yeah?

There's a big ol' gate around the corner.
I know.

I'm gonna pull out. You gonna get out,
and you go open the gate.

Why I got to open the gate?

What? Because you
gonna open the gate.

Next time we trapped in a garage
with a damn near seven-foot dead guy...

and we're in your car,
you can drive.

But until then,
you the gate-opener motherfucker.

Go ahead.

Be careful.

Thought that's where you put it.

How's that gonna help us?
It won't.

But at least now it won't go to waste
before we die in a monster stampede.

What?

Let's just say I get out this car
to open that gate, and I don't make it...

are you gonna be able
to live with yourself...

knowing you didn't get
to split this weed with me?

Yeah, man, I could live with myself, seriously.
Yeah, me too.

Right after this, you gonna open
that damn gate though.

It's like that?

See, I love how we
be thinking alike too.

Yeah, man.
That's why we get along.

Franklin crazy, man.

Yeah, I admire his work.

His work. That big
motherfucker's his work.

He dead.
He dead and shit, running around.

He talkin' about he's gonna kill us and shit.
He gonna kill us.

She thought where the air bag at.

I was like, "Man, you crazy, girl."

This a Gremlin.

We better duck.

You better duck.

Bring your seat belt from home.

It'd be, "You better tie your
regular belt around that seat."

Objects through the window
appear bigger than they are.

Yeah.

Jesus.

What you doing?

No, no. It's cool.

It's cool.

Good-bye. Get the fuck-

Oddjobz, my man.

Get back. Now.

Kidding. Just fucking with you.
I'm about to say. It's your boy.

How you doing over there on the bubbly?

We got a special going on, daddy.

Yes?
Yeah.

And since you one of my favorite
customers, these fell off the truck.

Half price, cash.
That's what I'm talking about.

Yeah!
Off the hook.

I knew you'd like that.

What up, Celly?
What up?

This is the list off all the cats who signed up
for the three-on-three basketball tournament.

Only one that's gonna
be a problem is George.

This fool wanna start his own team.

No. I don't want that.
He can be an extra on my team.

Except he wants his own team.

Is this what I pay to you do?
Make problems for me?

You supposed to fix problems.

I could bring the hurt to George.
I got no problem with that.

I could bring the hurt to George.

Whatever level of hurtness you wanna
bring to George, I can bring it to George.

You want low. You want medium.
You want high. I'll just dial it up.

Listen. Let me explain
something to you right here.

Listen. Check it out.

This is George, right?
Okay.

So now, George has his own team.

Huey and Dewey here.

But here comes Leon.

Time to go.

No more team for George.

Guess he'll have to come play for
Marcellus and the Procession after all.

You dig?
I dig.

All right. That's simple.

Yeah.

What's up?

Hell, yeah.
Hell motherfucking yeah.

That's what I mean.
You got it, right? Real simple.

Here's the problem that kind of
got me kind of fucked up here.

You took out
two cherries, right?

I know
that the olive is George.

Right?

But these two cherries,
is that two girls on George's team?

Nah.
I-

That's what fucks me up.

When I see two cherries,
I'm thinking that's two chicks.

Two honeys.

I wanna eat these honeys.
You know what I mean?

Like that.
Honeys out of there.

Honeys, to me, represent cherries.
You feel me?

See? We been babysittin'
Franklin, Jr. here.

We ain't even had time
to look for a third for the tournament.

Man, maybe we sit it out this year.

What? Are you crazy?

After the way
Marcellus disrespected us?

We just need somebody, man,
somebody big.

And wide.

And tall.
And strong.

What?

Oh, I got you.

You don't wanna say
in front of Frankie, Jr.

So who's gonna be our third, man?

Frankie!
Damn.

Ain't got to be yellin', man.

Yeah. Frankie. Look at him.

Frankie, stand up.
Frankie, stand up.

Stand up.
Look at that.

See? He's big.

He's wide. He's tall.

He's black.
He's black!

We win!

He just need practice.

A lot of practice.

Okay. Everybody good?

Yeah. Definitely.

Delicious.
So where did you say you're from, Frankie?

Frankie's from out of town.
Not from around here.

Oh, so what?
He's from a foreign country?

Yeah.
Alabama.

Alabama. Okay.
Look what I made for you, Darius.

Peach Cobbler. Your favorite.

Nice.

I know you like that.

Yes.
I forgot a knife. I'll be back.

Thanks.

Alabama?

Alabama, fool?
They got some big motherfuckers in Alabama.

I'm just trying to cover up.
What's that?

You ever been to Alabama?
No.

They got some big motherfuckers-
Don't you say nothing else.

Damn!
I got the-

Frankie never had pie
out there in Alabama.

Wow. Okay.

I guess it's nice
he liked it so much.

I'll get a napkin.

It's okay. It's all right.

Frankie, you can't do that.

No. No. No eat all food.

What you doing?
Please don't talk no more.

I pay $50 a month.
I can say what I want.

The rent is $375. You think I'm joking?
Don't drink all that water.

Frankie, don't drink- Don't drink
all that water. No. Don't drink it.

Would you put it down, please?
What the hell?

Look what you did-
let him drink all the damn water.

Me?

Frankie, calm down.
What's wrong?

Shit. He got to go to the bathroom.

Come on, Frankie.
Just hold it. Hold it.

No. No, this way, Frankie.
Come with me, Frankie.

You're in the zone, baby.

Get in there!

Get him through!

All right, unzip him.
Man, I ain't unzipping him.

Yes, you are.
Think of a number between one and 10.

Seven.
You are so off. Unzip him.

Man, I wasn't expecting that.

Man, I hate to say it, but I think
we gonna have to show him how.

Frankie, turn around this way.
Aim for the hole now.

Put it in.

You can get it in there.

Do it just like me and Darius
did it, okay?

Quit swingin' that thing, man.

Feel good, don't it?

There you go, Frankie.
There you go.

Motown!

Hey, Brin.

I don't even wanna think about what
y'all were doing in there, okay?

All I can say is...

I hope it was drugs.

What we gonna do
about Frankie, man?

Depends.
On what?

No. Depends.
Diapers.

He gonna need
some extra, extra large, man.

Nah. He'll be all right.

Frankie a fast learner.

You right as always, Motown.

Except the man was dead
just two days ago...

and can't say I blame him for being
a little slow on the court neither.

I know you bring me back to life though,
my motor skills are right there.

It's like when I'm alive.
Like-

Uh-huh.
Hey, motor skills.

Yeah. That's what I thought.
You play too much.

You crazy.

Frankie.

Hey, Frankie.
I'm gonna turn this down.

Hi- Frankie, hi.
I cleaned your clothes.

Oh, my goodness.
You are really one big fella.

Yeah. It's a good thing
I like 'em skinny.

Well, if it isn't Got No Game
and Got No Brain.

Real funny, Marcellus.
Yeah. Real funny.

Which one of us is which?

How's the hunt
for the team going, fellas?

Wait. I forgot.
No one wants to play with you nobodies.

Wait, wait. We are somebodies,
and we do have a team.

Planning on kickin' some butt
in the tournament. Now.

Who you tryin' to con? You two suck.
No one wants to play with you.

Marcellus, you always
think you know some shit.

But you don't know shit.
You tell him, Motown.

Frankie.

Yo. Who the big dude?

I don't know who that is, man.
I've never seen that dude before.

That's a big-ass dude.
You cannot miss that big-ass dude.

Yes!

What an eyeful.

You sittin' back there
gettin' all worked up...

like you ain't never seen a tall, studly,
bald black man before.

What? I'm just sitting here.

I want you sittin' there.

Check the big guy out.

I don't like surprises.

Not a bit.

Luwanda loves surprises.

You say something again?
What?

Did you say anything?
I don't think so.

Why does your neck keep turning like that?
Something wrong with your neck?

My neck is fine.
You need a neck brace?

Hurry up. Get me out of here.

Excuse me. Excuse me.
Yes?

Look at me when I'm
talking to you. Look.

What I'm tryin' to tell you-
I see you.

You act like you ain't never seen a studly, tall-
I'm sorry. What?

Just drive, Leon!
We about to roll out of here.

Man.

Just tryin' to get respect.

Hey, we out of here.

We out of here, punks.

What the hell?

This gear has checked out.

Everybody put their head down.
I can't see.

Put your head down.

What the-
Jesus Christ, man.

Put your head down.
Why you still eyeing this dude back there?

When I turn around to back the car out,
I see your back.

I'm in the backseat.
I know you're in the backseat.

When I put the car in reverse
and see what's behind me...

I see your head,
but your head is turned that way.

What?
Are you driving the car?

Or am I driving the car?
I'm in the backseat.

I know you're in the backseat.
I feel that part, but every time I turn around...

See, Frankie,
basketball is just like life.

You just got to aim for the top.

And coming from a man who works the night
shift at a morgue, you know it's sound advice.

So what you saying?
Nothing.

Damn. Where was I?
Aiming for the top, Phil Jackson.

Anyway, aim for the top.

Like this. Watch.

Like that.

See? Come on.

What the hell was all that?
It's pizzazz.

I'm tryin' to teach him how to play ball.
You doing-

What the hell is Frankie doing?

Look like he movin' to the beat.

Frankie, Jr.'s got some rhythm.

He does.

Hey, kid, turn that up.

Hey! Frankie, you like that?

Like the music?
Yeah?

Well, see, basketball
is just like music.

All right, it's a beat.
Got to bounce. See?

See the beat?
Follow the beat. Bounce.

Yeah! Like that.

Beat, beat, beat.

Yeah! See?

Now, you try.

Yeah? You go.

Come on. Yeah.

Yeah, pick it up, Frankie.

Okay, put it in.

Frank- Frank- No.

Frankie, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

You have to put the ball in the hoop, Frankie.
Yeah, Frankie.

You got to end up with the ball
going through the hoop.

Yeah.
Ball through hoop.

Uh-huh.
See? Ball through hoop.

Yeah!
Got it?

You try it.

Like he did it.
Shoot it.

No, Frankie.
You put it in hoop.

You want me?

Hey. All right.

Okay.

Come here. Come here.
No, no, no, no.

You have to put the ball
through the hoop, okay? You.

Now, get him down.
Darius down.

Good.
Thanks, Frankie.

You put the ball through the hoop.

You, ball through hoop.
Turn it up.

Crank it up. Crank it up.

To the beat. Yeah.

Through the hoop.

You try through the hoop.

Come on.
Hear the music. Hear the beat.

That's it. Come on.
That's it.

Come on.
Through the hoop.

Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

Like that, Frankie.
Yeah, Frankie!

He's got it!
By George Jefferson, I think he's got it.

Wait till I tell Marcellus.

Good job, Frankie.

I thought I'd find
you two goofing off.

Wait a second.
Who's this?

Mr. Samuels, it's Frankie.

You- Frankie. You remember Frankie.
Yeah, yeah.

You look familiar.

Watch him work.
You can learn something from this one.

Work, right?
Okay, y'all ready?

Yeah, yeah. Come on.

There's one for you.

Yeah.
One for me.

Yep.

And double zero for the big man.
Man.

There you go, Frankie.

Darius, how'd you come up with this?

It's my lifestyle.

"Freeballerz"?

Come on.

<i>Wake up, wake up, wake up.</i>

<i>The three-on-three</i>
<i>street ball tournament is starting now.</i>

Come on, man.
Play ball.

You ready to do this?
Let's go!

Let's do it. Come on.

Break it up!
Break it up!

Give it a rest.
Come on.

Go. Go.
Don't be doggin' me, baby.

You gotta be kidding me, baby!

<i>The Procession win.</i>

<i>They'll be moving on,</i>
<i>marching toward another championship.</i>

<i>Next up on center court,</i>
<i>a surprising entry-Freeballerz.</i>

Hey.

Calm down, okay?

Pass it!

Yeah!

Y'all go that way.
Over here. Come here.

All right. Good work.

We just need
to try to go up a couple points.

You see me, man?
We was out there like-Wham!

Hit 'em like that.

Frankie had a little something to do with it, right?
Oh, yeah. Of course.

Definite teamwork.
Good job, F-dude.

Frankie.

Hit that.

That's right.
Put it in.

<i>Winner: Freeballerz, with a dominating</i>
<i>performance by their new big man, Frankie.</i>

Did he say what I think he just said?
Yes, he did!

Freeballerz win, baby!
We win!

Hands up! Yeah! Yeah!

Get the fuck out of here.

I'm a winner!
I'm a winner!

What's up?

I'm Darius. Darius Manley.
Today's winner.

Hey. I'm Darius. You can call me "Dearius."
Hi!

Hi.
Hello, girl. I'm Darius.

What you find me on the big man?

Can't find nothin' on him.
Then try harder, Leon.

I need to know.

What's up?
Yeah.

Frankie, no. Let me show you again.

Like that. Turn right here.
Wait. Now watch me.

Put your head in first, so you're safe-
Hey.

Hey. Hey! Tammy!
Hey yourself.

Y'all looked really good out there.
Yeah? Thank you.

Good.
Thank you.

Did you get in the club the other night?
'Cause I didn't see you.

Yeah, for a second. We went to V.I.P.
It was crowded. Probably didn't see me there.

Right.
Had to get out. Emergency call for my job.

And you forgot to call me. Yeah.

About that- I was gonna call you-
What's with your friend?

Frankie, Frankie.

This is Frankie,
new member on our team.

He's a little different,
a little special.

Hi. I'm Tammy.

Hi! This is how we say hi.

Hi.
You say hi to everybody, not just one person.

Can't be selfish with it.

Okay.
We gotta get out of here, actually.

We got more people to say hi to.
Okay.

Just gettin' here.
And I gotta go anyway.

Okay. Good to see you.
I'll see you later.

Bye.
Bye. Nice meeting you.

You too.
Come on, Frankie.

Frankie, you can't be sniffin' the girls.
You can't do that.

I didn't even get
her phone number yet.

Okay? No sniff Tammy.

No sniff Tammy. Okay?

Tammy.
Yes. You like that, huh?

Big damn pimp.
Get in there.

A little bit to the side.

I'll tell you.

If the tournament was to end tonight,
I'd be a happy man.

Not saying I don't
wanna win, 'cause I do.

That would be big, you know.

Us and Frankie beatin' Marcellus.

Just think about it.

So, how much of a cut
do you think we gotta give Frankie?

I mean, technically he is dead.

See there, man, you go
thinkin' bad thoughts.

I'm only thinking
good thoughts right now.

About Tammy?
Yeah.

About Tammy too.

Tammy.

When did he start talkin'?

When he met Tammy.

Man! We startin' early tonight.

Oh, man.
Too slow, Negro.

Damn!

What's she doin'?
Come on, baby.

Take it up a notch.

You know what daddy likes.
<i>- Sig Alert on the 5 South.</i>

Hey. She gonna
hit herself in the face.

Okay. Three-second rule.
You know that.

They get bigger?

Looks good.

Man. Frankie?

You really are fucked up.

Nah. Something's wrong.

Yo, Frankie.

Frank.

Hey. Hey, Frank, man.

Frankie.

See? He's okay.
Yeah.

Yeah. Let him see that.

That'll wake him up.

Look up there, Frankie. Yeah.

Take a look at those.

Yeah.

Yes, sir.

Tammy.

No. No. No.

That's-Well, kind of.

Quit playing around!

<i>If you're waking up now, the Freeballerz</i>
<i>continue to be this year's big surprise.</i>

<i>- And I mean big surprise!</i>
What's my name?

Get off my court.
I don't lose.

I thought you got rid of
George's number two.

I did. I guess
he got himself a new boy.

I can't believe that
motherfucker turned me down.

Doin' his thing though.

That's exactly
why we need some edge.

And I think I just seen it.

Really good, Frankie. See how strong you are?
Yeah.

Yeah. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

Yeah.
Man. I was looking like M.J.

Who? Michael Jarvis?

Just messing with you, man.

Hey, Motown.

Lookin' real nice out there.
I'm feelin' it.

Listen.
Just wanted to wish you luck.

Thanks.

Nah, man. Why you being all nice to us?
Come on, Marcellus.

If Marcellus wants to be nice,
he'll be nice, okay?

Even if that means being nice
to you two fools. All right?

Just take the niceness.

Did I say you had to be in this meeting?

I got your back!

The truth is, you guys
have been playing real good.

I thought the Cruisers would cut you off
at the knees, but you bounced back.

You got game.

Great. Great, great.

What do you want, Marcellus?
I don't want anything.

A bunch of us will be at the club tonight,
getting our grown man on.

Why don't y'all come by and join us?
Us?

No! The two local crackheads.

Of course you.

And bring your big friend.
I don't know.

Hey, what's the matter with you, Morris?
We're just trying to have some fun.

I'll see you there.

Motown.
Yeah.

You trust him?

Hell, no!

But we're going to the club, right?

What?

We're on the list.
That's what.

Motown Davis.

And Manley.

Darius Manley.

And this here's Frankie.
Right there.

Cool.

Y'all go right on in.

Fucking get back.

See, Frankie?

A place like this, man,
you gonna need some pointers.

I think what he's saying
is, Frankie, is-

may work on a werewolf bitch,
but it ain't gonna be enough in here.

Now, I have
some tried-and-true methods.

And what are those, Darius?

Well, when a girl asks me what I'm all about,
I tell her I'm an astronaut trainee.

Man, do you know
there's barely any black astronauts?

Exactly. That's why
I tell her I'm a trainee.

I tell her
why ain't no more black astronauts...

and how I'm staking out
new turf for the black man.

Yeah. Gets 'em every time.

I hate I'm even asking this in the club,
but why aren't there any black astronauts?

You think the government wants us up
there with all their white space women?

Where's he goin'?
He'll be fine.

I'm gettin' a drink.

Hey.
Didn't I see you play today?

Well, if you didn't,
I have it TiVo'd back in my crib.

I'd like to see that.
Hey, Darius.

Sabrina, what you doing here?
I just came to give you the good news.

I went to the doctor,
and you didn't give me herpes.

What you do that for?

Do what?

Go sit two stools down.

Hey. Excuse me.

Is Tammy Dexter working?
Tammy.

Tammy.
I don't know. I'll go see.

Hello.

Is this seat taken?

Good. So, why don't you
buy us a couple of drinks?

Okay. Drinks. All right?
We at the club. I could- Drinks. I could-

Waitress, could you come here for a-
Waitress. Hey.

I was wondering, could I get
a couple 40 ounces, please?

Make it a bottle of your best champagne.
Thanks.

Don't worry, baby.
You can handle it. Run a tab.

Sit.

Stay.

Good girl.

Again.

So, what do you do?

Work at the morgue.

No, really.
What do you do?

I'm an astronaut trainee.

I didn't think there were
a lot of black astronauts.

It's an interesting story.

Here we go.

Monster of a man like that shows up out
of nowhere and plays for those two losers?

I'm not buyin' it.

That's why I got a cop friend
down in Rampart gonna run this for me.

Handle that.

You got a friend who's a cop?
Yeah.

You know a dude who's a cop?
Yeah.

Wow, man.

L could have took care of this.

I could have ran it.
You know.

And that's why me and Sabrina
don't look alike.

If you see my sister, you'll know.
Not the same father.

So then-

So that's-That was the end of us
having to all take baths together.

They-
They wanted to listen. I could tell.

But they hadn't been trained really.
It's hard to walk pit bulls.

Like, the whole, you know-

I thought that I had a hit record.
It's funny.

You're so cute.

That's nice of you.
This is delicious. This drink.

I told you it was gonna be delicious.
It's great.

Good. I like it.

You are so cute. You know that?

Thank you.

I don't know.
Maybe if I had-

Oh, that thing
comes off pretty easy.

Be careful.

Yeah.

There's people in here.

You know that?

I've never seen a girl
like you before in my life.

No?
No.

Hey.

Hey, everybody, look at me.

What church you go to?

Good.
Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

You doing it big
over here, Motown.

Hey. Marcellus and Leon.
What's up, y'all?

This is Vanessa.

Say hi, Vanessa.
How you doing?

What's up, Vanessa?
She would have said hi to y'all earlier, man.

She is saying hi to a lot of people.
Look. I can dig it.

It's time to get her in the Jag.
Oh, yeah.

Vanessa, they gonna
put you in the Jag.

You get the bottom.
You don't mind, right?

Top, bottom.

My dude,
you know how to party.

You the man though.
I gotta tell ya.

Thank you. Okay.
Let's do this. Got it?

It was nice meeting you.
Yeah. Whatever.

Hey. Hey, Tammy.

Hey. I was looking-
I looked for you.

You here.

You seem to be having a good time.

Yeah. You know. No.

Not really.
It's kind of boring in here.

Motown, I have eyes, okay?

God.

I just really thought
you were different.

I am.

No. Obviously not.

Wait.

Wait.

Mister, you are talking my language.

I think I just threw up a little
in my mouth.

Swallow it back down,
'cause we gotta practice, man.

Hey. Who you motherfuckers think you are?
What?

I don't know about him,
but I'm the motherfucker who need a mint.

You ran out on your tab last night,
and I had to cover.

The tab was, like, 750,jackass.
Nah.

I didn't drink that much champagne.
Yeah, you did.

Girl like Vanessa
got expensive taste.

What, you think she liked you
for your cute little smile?

That's a lot of chips, Cellus.
Goddamn right it is.

And I need 'em today.

All right.

Maybe I spoke too soon.

I'm a reasonable dude.
We friends, right?

Yeah, I guess.

So friends should always
work shit like this out.

Right. So, you spot us the dough,
and then when we get it, we give it to you.

We're good for it.

Y'all ain't good for shit.

But I'll tell you what though.

Big man-
I could use him for the tournament.

No deal.

Either big man plays for me,
or he don't play for anyone ever.

You can't take this out on Frankie.

I can take this out on whoever gonna
keep me from winning.

I'm chasing a record,
and I won't be denied.

And it's sad to say-

but if I get rid of you two motherfuckers,
who'd notice?

Yeah.

Come on. Let's go talk-

Excuse me. Excuse me, man.

Yeah.
Let's go talk. Come here, Darius.

Come here, Frankie.
Go and talk about it, Darius.

Come here.

Frankie, this might be
a good opportunity for you, man.

You know?

Play with Marcellus
and the Procession.

They're a good team.

I mean, we're losers,
and they're winners.

We winners too.
No, Darius. We're not.

You said it yourself, man.
I do this every year.

Right?

Frankie a winner.

Probably wouldn't have
pulled it off anyway.

Be good for you.
You know?

Later for all this huddle-up shit.
Come on, big man.

Take care of him, Marcellus.

Damn.

You realize we up
for the next round, right?

Yeah.

I know.

We'll find somebody, man.

With five minutes notice?
Who's that?

Pass the ball.
Pass the fucking ball.

Go, go, go.
Ankles.

Go, little man. Go.
We got it. We got it.

I think he's fouling me.
Shut up. It's cool.

Got your fucking glasses on, ref?
Set it up.

Go down.
Pass it again. I'm fucking open.

All right. Come on.

Good money. Yeah.
Yes!

Freeballerz for life!
That's what I'm talking about!

<i>Freeballerz down by 18</i>
<i>without their big man Frankie.</i>

<i>I'm keeping my money in my pocket.</i>

<i>No. Wait.</i>
<i>We've got 5-0 on the court.</i>

<i>- Great defensive move by the police.</i>
I'll kill him.

Ain't gettin' him to panic, captain.

It wasn't me.

Pass the fucking ball already.
I'm wide open.

Looks like it's a forfeit.

Freeballerz win.
What? What?

Yeah! We made it!
<i>- Freeballerz moving on to the next round.</i>

You 13, 14.
Let's do this shit, baby.

That's some bullshit
y'all playing. Come on.

Frankie, come on. Frankie. Go.

Yeah! That's how, Frankie!

Bring it to the hole.

Yeah!

I can't stand this game!
I hate this game!

Take your ass home!

That's what I'm talkin' about!

<i>The Procession delivering a new lesson</i>
<i>with their center Frankie.</i>

<i>No way these guys can be stopped.</i>

<i>The Procession once again</i>
<i>confident in this tournament.</i>

Frankie. Say, man.

Nice defense out there.

The Procession don't waste
their time with losers.

You dig?

Let's go, Frankie.
We're just saying hi, Marcellus.

Yay, Frankie!

Congratulations!

Okay. So?

How do you want to celebrate?

You want to hang
with your friends, or...

you want to come home
for a tumble in Luwanda's playpen?

Bye-bye.

What's my name, Frankie?

Tammy.

Close enough.

What's my name?

You are such a mystery.

Such a big
and wonderful mystery.

You miss
your friends, don't you?

Marcellus is never gonna let you play
with those two again.

He won't allow it.

Hey. You see Frankie today, man?

He ain't look like himself.

Like something's wrong, you know.

What's wrong is we don't have him.

Nah.

It's something else.

Like he's tired, or worse.

Maybe he's got "monster-nucleosis."

I don't know, D.

Something ain't right.

<i>Raging Dr. Johnson to the E.R.</i>

<i>Dr. Johnson to the E.R.</i>

You got what I asked for?

Your friend the cop ran big man's prints
off that beer bottle.

Let's see what the-

What the fuck is this, Leon?

I wanted to know who the big guy is.
This is a death certificate.

I know he doesn't look dead,
but he has the certificate.

That's the crazy shit.

This don't make sense.

Or maybe it does make sense.

Where better for them losers
to find a third than the county morgue?

Yeah. Frankie's turned
unreliable, Leon.

Make George our third.

What if Motown and Darius
get big man working again?

Can't let that happen.

We take him out.

Kill him?

Can't kill what's already dead.

Hey, hey, Frankie.
What's happening?

Come on.

Yeah. Come on, Frank. Come on, Frankie.
Come on. Here we go.

One, two, three.

Darius.

Right in the trash.
Right where he belongs.

That's just nasty, man.

Green slime, man.

Come on, fellas.
He won't make it through the night.

Hello, little girl.

I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

That's probably some good advice.

Right now I can't
really remember much.

I need some help.

I'm pretty sure I can't help you.

So kindly get the fuck off my lawn
and get your help somewhere else.

Don't make me beat your ass.

All I need is a little information.

In that case,
there's your information.

Satisfied?

And I don't want to see that
pin-striped ass around here again.

Listen, you-

I hope tonight you have to eat soap.

For dinner!

Soap mixed with toe jam.

Mouse droppings!

And boogers too!

Motown.

Tammy, what are you-
I thought after the club, you didn't wanna-

Look, Marcellus kicked
Frankie off his team, all right?

What?
Yes. And now he's gone.

Then we gotta find him.

Tammy, the girl at the club-
I didn't like her.

Marcellus set me up.
Hey. Hey.

Let's just find your friend, okay?

Let's go.

Damn.

Where could he be?

He's like a big baby out here.

He don't know anything.

Shit.

Take a look
at this poor sucker here.

That's Franklin.
That's Franklin.

It's who?
Franklin!

Y'all gave him away?

No.

Well, kind of.

Where's he at?

He's in a very delicate
state right now.

We gotta find him soon,
or he's gonna die.

Again.
Wait. What's he mean?

You should have seen him on the court.
He was doing fine, right?

For how long?
Long enough to get us into the finals.

Y'all worked him too hard, man.

Maybe you put him together wrong.

Somebody please
tell me what's going on.

Frankie was originally dead.

Not the heart. That was fresh.

Yeah. That was fresh.
I can't believe he lasted this long...

fuckin' with y'all.

Frankie.

Frankie. Frankie.

Frankie.
Look at him, man!

He's all fucked up now!

Frank.
Frankie. Is he gonna make it?

If I could get him to sync back up-

Music. We need music.

Darius, what are you doing?

Frankie's in trouble,
and all you can do is think about your music?

I'm just sayin'.
Sayin' what? Why?

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Stop doing what you're doing.

You continue doing what you're doing.

Look. He's syncing up!

Good morning.

Mornin'.

How is he?

Pretty much the same.

You sat with him all night?

For a few hours.

He's actually kind of cute.

Really?

But not as cute as you.

So, does this mean you forgive me
for being such a dope?

Should I?

Frankie.

Hey, Darius, Frankie.

Hey, big fella.

You okay?

He's back.

How is he?

He's still not looking so good.

Damn.

And it's 10:15 a.m.
Shit. The finals.

Man, the hell with the finals.
I'm not playing no ball and Frankie layin'-

You wanna play, Frankie?

Good luck.

I'm gonna holler at that monitor, 'cause if
these two fuck-offs can't show up, it's a forfeit.

We the champs.
That's what's up.

Sounds like you're scared
to play us, Marcellus.

Put me down, you woolly mammoth.
Frankie.

Put me down.
Frankie.

Get him off me.
Frankie.

Let's play ball.

You heard him.

Let's go!
Play ball.

<i>Final round.</i>

<i>The defending champion Procession</i>
<i>against the upstart Freeballerz.</i>

<i>They started out as a joke,</i>
<i>but nobody's laughing now.</i>

Two. One, two. One, two.

Get up, Darius!

Get in there.
Get in there.

Yeah!

Come on, man.

You're killing me, man.

You got a boo-boo, big man?
Check him out.

Let's go.
He got it.

He can't make it?
He got it.

He's fine.

Put it up, D.

Let's go. Let's go.
Up top. Up top. Up top.

Good follow-up. Good follow-up, D.
Good follow-up.

<i>Freeballerz down by five.</i>
<i>They're wearing down.</i>

They're garbage!

<i>Wake up, Frankie.</i>
<i>Looking tired out there, big man.</i>

We're doing all right.
We're doing all right.

Frankie, you cool?
What's up with you, Frank?

You good?

All right, Frankie.
Cool, man. Darius. Defense, all right?

Yeah.
Yeah.

You all right?

Too good over there, but let's just go.
Let's beat them.

All right, fellas. Let's go.
Come on, Frankie.

Let's go. Check it up.

You can do it, man.
There you go.

Let's go!
Come on, man. Play ball.

Y'all gotta play some D!
Bullshit test.

Let's go, baby.

Come on.
Y'all killing me right here.

Oh, big man!

Let's go. Let's go.

What do you think, daddy?

Can't win the right way, huh?

Frankie.

Tammy.

Yeah. It's Tammy.

Tammy.

They're here for you, big fella.
They're here for you.

Yeah.
Get up.

Come on, Frankie.

Yes.

Yes.

Frankie.

<i>The heart of a champion.</i>

<i>The big man is back on his feet</i>
<i>with the Freeballerz down by one.</i>

Let's go, guys.
Play ball. Let's go.

Let's go.
It's Freeballerz's ball.

Game point!
Come on. Game point.

<i>Freeballerz's ball.</i>
<i>Just enough time for one shot.</i>

Yeah!

<i>The Freeballerz have won.</i>

<i>They're the new champs.</i>

Yeah!

Damn.

We won! We won!

We won! You hear that, girl?

Yeah!

Yeah!
Baby!

Are you okay?

What's for breakfast?

You all right.

Give me a kiss.

That was nice.

Come on.

You're so crazy.

Get up.

Now you're playing against
three somebodies.

Yeah!
Come on.

Yeah! Yeah!

All right, partner.
See y'all.

Watch it with my sister, man.
Bye.

Well, it looks like
you got everything you wanted.

Not everything.

Tammy.

You are silly.

Hey, man.
Get off my sister.

You know what it means
now that we won the tournament, right?

Yeah. I can finally
move off your couch.

Hey, man.
Don't let that $5,000 go to your head.

Five thousand?

Twenty-five divided by three gives me-

Back rent.

Anyway,
it means we gotta defend the title.

Not if we don't get our third back.

Girl, now you're
talking my language.
