You better change
your attitude,

Look man,
I apologize.

But l"m frustrated

Belng frustrated
Is just part
of the job.

You do this,

a better gig.

Stay in there

It"s all gratifying.
Bro, I got you.

I'm not Interested
In spendlng the rest
of my llfe

as a fucking wet nurse
to a bunch of broke dick
cocksuckers on the road.

I don"t know
what you trippin" for.

I don"t know why

when you know
out there,

thata love being
in your shoes,
in your position,

which you ain"t

I want out, H ustle.

This life ain"t

I need a new life
far away from
this shit.

Don"t get
me wrong.

I appreclate everythlng
that you done
for me.

I know It's
been a lot.

But it"s time for
me to move on.

It aln't that
easy, plmp.

When you did
your full five calendars,

soon as you touched
down on the floor,

I pushed you
in the game,
I gave you a lifeline,

I gave you a know,
I gave you a mouth
to mouth resuscitation.

I brought you back
In thls shlt, man.

I fucked around,
got comfortable
wlth you,

you know a llttle blt
of my buslness,

you dig? And I just
can"t let you
cut it off

like an umbilical
cord, pimp.

What are
you tellin" me?
One more job?

One more job
and it"s done.

There it
is then.

Awright?

A wrlght.

Yo man, how much
longer we gotta do
this shit for a dog?

Till we can prove
we can hold
our own.

l"m pulling a stack
a day already.

I told you I got
my boy Malcom
working on some shit.

If it pops,
we"re all on.

I hope so, nlgga,

"cause all of this
shit l"m tired
of it, dog.

Man, what's good?

What up, B?

Holding up Outty
as always.

What"s going, man?

Boss man said
be on the lookout.

It might get
hot today.

You need a re-up?

l"m straight.

Your cousin get back
to you on that yet?

Nah, he"s supposed
to hit me later.

We got some
shit going on.

Stop whining like
a bitch and get
this money.

Why you always
worrying and shit?

As soon as
something pop on,

you"s gonna be
the first person
to know.

Yeah, stop whining
like a little bitch.

Hold the fuck up.

Brush your teeth.
Your breath sucks.

Where's cousln
Malcolm anyway?

Who knows?

Damn, look at
the llttle glrl.

So, why are
you here?

Here for
a visit.

Why you always think
everybody wants
something from you?

Most people
come here
for a visit.

Either want
something,

or they think
they"re doing
me a favor.

Which is it?

U ncle, I wanna ask you
a couple of questions
about something.

That shit you talked
about the last time
I came to see you.

What shit?

l"m tired of hustling
the streets.

If I don"t hit
a big score soon,

l"m gonna wind up
just like you.
No offense.

You still runnin"
with that crew workin"
for H ustler?

Yeah, we tired
of the street shit.

l"m ready
to move up.

I want a better life
than this for me.

So what do
you want
from me?

A while back, I heard
you talk about this
thing in Maysville.

A bank no one
had ever robbed.

Yeah, I never
got to that one.

That one
got away.

I was wondering.

Wondering?

Maybe you can
tell me that
story again.

But this time
with a few
more details.

Why would
I want to do that?

Because this could
put me on!

Plus you ain"t goin"
anywhere for a while.

True.

I could use
a score llke thls.

Get me off
of these corners.

Fine.

You wanna go
from runnin"
to robbin",

that"s fine.

But you better
put together
a good crew.

If you don"t,
you spend
the rest

of your days
staring at bricks.

You got that?

Yessir.

Now listen.

This bank isn"t
just an ordinary bank.


[cell phone rings]

Wassup, man?

What up, man?

U nc filled me in.
We on, my nigga.

That"s what"s good.

Find a way
to meet me
at the spot in 20.

I can do
that, man.
We be there.

Awright, dog.
Holler.

Yo, man.
When the nigga
comin" thru?

I thought he"d be
here by now.

He"ll get here
when he gets here.

Oalm your ass down
and check out
shawty here.

What's up, babe?

Hey. You guys
wanna order
something?

No, thanks.
We good.

How about
the special?

Fantastic.

Bro, we
ain"t eatin".

Bullshit,
l"m eatin".

We aln't got
no tlme.
We can't eat.

We just waiting
on someone.

He ain"t even
here yet.

We on business.
None of that bullshit.

Never heard
of a business lunch?

Yo, finally!

What up, bro?

Hey, what's good

O"mon dawg,
you been
shaking hands

with crackheads
all day.
What up, Bone?


Scoot your ass
over, man.

You gonna take
my seat, man?

H ustle know
where you all at?

No, I told him
we had some baby
mam drama.

So what"s up, man?

Besides being like
that for 25 more,
I guess good.

Y"all ain"t
gonna believe
what he told me.

Don"t keep
a nigga
in suspense.

Listen. He told me
about a bank
in Maysville.

But it"s not just
an average bank.

It"s a holding depot.

Man, what
the fuck is
a holding depot?

Klnda llke
at Cutty.

You got
the stash spot
for the stuff.

Well, this bank
is a stash spot
for other banks.

How many banks
stash their
dough there?

I don"t know
but he told me

it"s an easy two
or three million.

Yessir.

We gotta get
that dough for real.

He told me the layout
of the bank,

the streets, all that stuff.

If we get some serious artillery,

we should be able to walk in and
walk out. Easy.

It can"t be that easy.

My uncle robbed 22 banks before
he got caught.

If he says it"s easy,
l"m inclined to
believe him.

So this is what you motherfuckers
been talkin' about.

Tell me you got
an easy ass plan.

The way I see it
we"re going there
Friday afternoon late.

Right before the bank closes up for
the weekend.

We go in, we go out.

We gotta get them guns.

This is a motherfucking bank, dog.

Where we gonna get that kind of firepower?

Good question.

I was thinkin" Hustle.

Hustle? You remember what
happened last time?

He tried to take that fucking risk.

Can"t be riskier than the shit
we been doin".

Out on the streets,
sellin" for this nigga.

For this kind of payoff,

l"m willin" to take that risk for real.

I don"t plan on dying
in the streets like
everybody else.

l"m trying to live my life.

I hear you.

Man, that was beautiful, dog.

Sound like a damn after school special.

Shut your ass.

I was just lettin"
him know it
was beautiful.

Heat It up.

Steam It up
a llttle blt.

More attitude,
more attitude,
more attitude.

And... cut.

We"ll continue
in a few minutes.

What"s going
on fellas?

Sorry to
Interrupt, man.

It"s good.Just my new
side business.

Good money in lesbians!

l"m not a lesbian, motherfucker.

I llke dlck, too.

l"ll keep that in mind.

You supposed to be holdin" down Outty.

l"m here to provide you with a business
opportunity though.

Last time you presented me with an opportunlty,

MacHenry went to jail and Young got shot
in the finger.

We had no idea that nigga was Vice.

You"re always fucking off a good thing.

We had the shit laid out, y"all
fucked it off.

Trust me on this one, I got you.

I got this new job that l"m working on,

all I need is firepower.

What kind?

Something for each of us.

Something to put the fear of
god into these niggas hearts.

Some bin ladens?
Some mini 14s?
Some mp5s?

All that.

Okay, okay. Who your
wheel man?

Bone here.

Know how
to drlve?

We don't need no square motherfuckers behind the wheel.

You better know
how to scoot.

I can handle
this shit.

It's cool, for real.

Okay.
How big Is the job?

The job,
big big.

Give me
the details.

Let"s just worry
about that money.

Shit, I don't remember getting paid for the
last one, did you?

We just went through that.

Why bring up old shit?

You know I got caught.

Why you get boisterous?

l"ll take your top off.

That last shit wasn"t my fault.

I laid that shit out for you.

The shit went sour,
you fucked it up.

I gave you the crew.
Look at my partner"s finger, man.

Trigger finger fucked off.

What"s it gonna take
to make up for
the other shit?

A percentage.

Since when?

Since I found out my cousin made
it big in the music biz.

They kick'n they feet like they on fire and takin'
risk no more.

They takin" percentages and that"s what l"m
gonna start doin".

That"s bullshit.

Fuck you.

You want help?
Give me a cut.

Name it.

Twenty percent plus what you
owe me.

You out of your
motherfuckin" mind!

You out of line.

My fault, dog.

Oh, 20% is too much.
l"m only getting
some guns.

But you already
owe me.

Wages, ball and legal,
how you put a price
on my homeboy flnger?

Five percent.

Ten percent.

That"s a deal.

Don't disappoint me.

You know what happened
to the last motherfucker
that disappolnted me?

He got his
top took off.

come by tomorrow
and l"ll have what
you need.

Awright.

Yo, thanks, H ustle.

lt"s cool, man.

It"s all gravity.

These niggas crazy?

Young, ambitious,
and hungry

but at the same
time green.

What we gonna
do about them then?

l"m gonna call
a favor.

I know this
ain"t a motel.

Yeah.

Where the fuck
we stayin"?

We gotta be the scarlest
motherfuckers around here.

You glvln' out
room servlce here?

Relax, we won"t
be all day.

You"re late.

Who the fuck you supposed to be?

H ustle sent me.
Said you need
some assistance.

This a joke?

See me laughing?

Thls Is gettin'
complicated.

He already got
me for 10%.

l"ll be damned
if we split
five ways.

That wasn"t part
of the plan.

Look, kid...
plans change.

Kid?

Look at you, all balls and
no brains

thinking you make
the decisions.

Well, guess what?
You don"t.

The decision"s
already been made.

So go ahead
and get behlnd
lt... qulckly.

What does that
make you?

Hustle's Insurance pollcy.

Bullshit!
lt"s my job, nigga!

I don"t need help
from you!

Maybe you under the impression
that I give a fuck
what you think.

Well, I don"t.
I don"t even
want to be here.

But you been
dealt a bum hand.

So either fold up
and go home,

or play these cards out
and see if you can"t
win these chips.

You done?

Yeah, l"m done.
You got a map
for me?

Your informant
knew what they
was talkin" about.

Damn right.

We need to hlt
them about closlng.

We"ll come through
hard and heavy.

Make sure you got
the car parked
around back.

We gotta snatch up
all the cash they got,

should make for
a pretty clean getaway.

So you making
the decisions now?

l"m doin" what H ustle
sent me to do.

Which is make sure
this shit goes
off smoothly.

If you was some
smart motherfuckers...

Agaln wlth the Insults.

I ain"t got time
for your corner
boy bullshit.

You came
wlth a map,
that's good.

l"m more interested
in the exit plan.

There aln't shlt
wrong wlth the map.

It's not gonna hurt
to take a look today.

How the fuck
we gonna do that?

l"m gonna
walk there.

Why you?

Who else?
Baby Shaq here and
the Get Fresh crew?

I'm the only who's
not gonna ralse
any susplclons.

You gonna
just walk in
and take pictures?

No, l"m gonna
open up an account.

Like a citizen.

Tomorrow afternoon,
we're gonna do thls.

And I don"t want it
fucked up because
we weren"t ready.

So y'all stay here
In the room,

don't let anybody
see you,

when I get back,
we'll go over the plan.

Just relax,y"all gonna get
your money.

Dog, he just took
your plan,

bent you over and fucked you
In the ass wlth lt.

Shut the fuck up!

Tell you what, dog,

that nigga

back for real,

"cause we gonna

some words.

Hey!

How are you?

Doin" well, thanks.

Oan I help you

No, just takin"
a look around.

You ain"t up
from around here.

No, I just
got here.

Where are you
coming from?

l"m from Miami.

Ooh, a big city.

Yeah, it is.

So what brings
you to Maysville?

You sure do ask
a lot of questions.

Yeah, I do.
That"s my job.

J ust wanted
to get away,

a little slower pace.

Well, a city that size,
you oughtta try
a whole lot quieter.

That"s just
fine by me.

You got a place to stay?

No, not yet,
not yet.

If you need anything,
don"t be afraid
to ask.

l"ll do that.

You have
a nice day.

You too.

Who was that?

A new neighbor.

Oh yeah?
Haven"t had one
of those in a while.

No, we haven"t.
Let"s keep
an eye on him.

See what we
can find out.

Sure.

We had a deal, Hustle.

I don"t remember
anything about sending

someone to watch
my back.

Deals change, Skl.

The way that last job
turned out that
I shot you,

you smell
what l"m sayin"?

I thought it best
to send someone
with experience.

I can handle it.

I don"t need
no fucking
chaperone, man.

Adapt and
adjust, Ski.

That"s all
you can do.

Nice weapon.

I own two.

A little too much weight
in the tip for my taste.

(H unter)
But that's what
glves It penetratlon.

I wouldn"t know.

You military?

Used to be.

A long time ago,
another life. You?

Hell, yeah.
Gulf war
one, baby.

But not anymore,
I take it.

Nah, not anymore.

I dld my stlnt,

worked a few
other projects,

top secret shit.

But then
they let me go.

What do you hunt?

What's that?

What do you hunt?

As in why you
shopping here?

J ust taking
a look around.

Maybe pick up
a few supplies.
You know.

M mm.

And then I guess
you gonna knock over
a bank and move on.

J ust kidding.

l"m here on
business myself.

I guess you gonna
tell me all about
that, right?

Well, I could.

You seem trustworthy.

Simplified and all.

Besides, I doubt
you"d even believe me.

Whatever gave
you that idea?

Look, man.
I get it, okay?

Let me tell
you something.

l"ve seen some
shit in my day.

l"m sure you
have too.

But right now,
l"m onto something
really, really big.

Something that
will blow your
fuckin" mind.

Do tell.

Let"s just
say this.

Do you have
any plans tonight?

Why?

"Cause I would suggest
that you conduct
them inside.

Really?

Listen, man.
l"m gonna give it
to you straight.

Tonlght Is
a new moon.

It"s the one night
of the month

that they come
out to feed.

Who?

I could call them vampires,

but I doubt you"d
believe that.

If I called
them zombies,

aw, I know you
wouldn't belleve that.

All I know is that
they were people,

and now they
somethlng else.

Something... unnatural.
Parasites.

They feed on blood.
H uman... blood.

And if they
bite you,

you become
one of them.

Awright, man.

Awright.

They"re nesting
outside of town.

Yeah they are.

Just stay
inside tonight.

Y"all as tired
of this shit
as I am, man?

No doubt, man.

We gonna sit
and let that brother
roll over us?

Or we gonna do
something about it?

Hell, yeah.
What you
got in mind?

Oh, yeah.

Man, what"s
this shit for?

You know
what it is?

Right now?

We supposed
to do this shit
by tomorrow man.

It ain"t no time
like the present.

What about
whlte dude?

Hustle said
he"s the one
in charge.

Think H ustle give a fuck
when we come back
with that money?

Fuck that
brother, man.

How long we
gonna be in there?

We in there longer
than 10 minutes, we
gonna have some trouble.

U ncle always said
don"t get greedy.

Greed"s what
get you caught.

Sound advlce.

I can"t wait to see
the expression on
that motherfucker"s face.

Hey.

Hey.

We don"t see
many new faces
around here.

I don"t see much
of anybody
around here.

Nobody every
really comes
downtown anymore.

l"m Jackson.

Kate.

N ice to meet you.

Good to meet
you too.

How do you
like it here
so far?

It"s quiet.

There"s definitely
no shortage of that
here in Maysville.

So where you
from originally?

M iami.

Really?
Sounds exciting.

I suppose so.

That"s gotta be better
than around here.

You don"t like it here?
lt"s nice here.

Who knows?
Nothing wrong
with it, just...

nothing right
with it either.

I suppose you always
want to leave the place
where you grow up.

Try something new.

Yeah. That
makes sense.

Is that what
you"re up to?

Trying something new?

Something like that.

So how long
you been on
the force?

What?

Oalling it a force
might be a bit
of a stretch.

l"ve been a deputy
a little over
a year now.

That"s good.

Actually,

it"s... it"s
a little boring.

I mean,
the most
we get...

Yeah, I
suppose so.

Probably have
a lot of that
in M iami, huh?

A little bit.

Looks like
we made it
just in time.

I think
you"re right.

Good to meet you.

You too.

Hope to see you.

Definitely.

Rich, I found you
a new customer.

Welcome to Maysville
Savings Bank.

Well, yeah,
