[film projector rattling]

[woman laughs]
All right, I wanna be here too.

[both moaning]

You better get up there then.
Okay, all right, I'm coming.

Oh, watch it! [laughs]

[woman laughing]
Get up there.


Happy anniversary, my love.

[both moan]
That was nice.

Yeah, that was really nice.

And there's plenty more
where that's coming from, baby.

Okay, mm.
[both laughing]

Mm-hmm!
[both chuckling]

To a beautiful and unforgettable
anniversary, Mrs. Miller.

Mm, I love it
when you call me that.

[man growls]
Mm!

[both laughing]

Mm, okay, all right now.

Mmm.
All right, come on, baby.

There's plenty of sugar
where that came from.


Oh, behave.

[both sigh happily]

Here we go, my love.

Mm, thank you.


for the three of us.

Mm. I hope Zion
doesn't give Dad a hard time.

You know,
he wasn't feeling this move.

I think he misses
his city friends.

Yeah, but it's better
for Zion, Walt.

It's better for us.

Yeah?
Yeah.

You know...
Hm?

I was thinking we should open up
a bed and breakfast.

Bed and breakfast.

Come on,
we have the rooms, honey.

this all night.

[woman] Mm, I know.
[man] You know what my answer is.


Anything for you.

[heartbeat echoing]
[man laughs]

[woman indistinct]

[phone dings]

Jed, hello.

You there?

Yes, it's your brother.

Listen,
I'm sending my Tommy over,

and you gather your two boys

because I got a job
for them to do.

Do you understand?
Do you understand?!

[film projector rattling]

[breathing heavily]

I need your strength, Lord,

to say no when I'm tempted
to surrender

to harmful things.

Or when selfishness clings
and won't let go.

I need your strength, Lord,
to say yes.

Yes... when cowardice and fear,

they nudge me.

No, no!

No!


You must do it, you must.

He ordered you to do it.



Hello, Unc!
Is that you, Tommy?

Yeah, man,
I heard you yelling outside.

Is everything okay,
are you all right?

I been waiting for you!

I know, Pop just sent me over...

Shut up, boy!

Come here.

[whispering indistinct]

All right, you got...

You... all right, all right.
All right.

And your two cousins
are gonna be there with you,

to make sure you do it right.

Get outta here!

No, no, no!

Tommy, come back here.

Now this here
will make too much of a mess.

Now this is iron.

It'll knock her out

and finish her too quickly,
no good.

[hammer thuds]
This, this is wood.

This'll work just fine.

Now your father, he just had
the rugs cleaned in room nine.

That won't leave much of a mess.

But wait...

You need to finish with this.

All right,
what about the husband?

Tommy, don't worry
about the husband.

The boys will be there
to hold him.

Oh.
Wait.

I need you to close your eyes.

Keep 'em closed.

Perfect. Now open them.

Your father does not want her
to see your face

when you cleanse her
of her sins.

Go and make her
pure again, Tommy.

[woman screaming]

Now grab him, make him watch!

[woman sobs]
Stop!

No!
Louise!

Settle down, settle down!
Stop, stop!

Walt, help!
Get off her!

Don't fight. [laughing]
Stop, no!

Walt, help me!

Let her go!
[Tommy] Shut him up!

Let her go!


Shut up,
or you're both gonna die!

Pocketbook is over there.

Just-just take it,
take what you want.

Just let us go!
[Tommy laughs]

You hear that boys,
take what we want?

No, I think it's quite
the opposite, ma'am.

My family thinks
you're trying to take from us.

I-I don't understand.
What do you want from us?

It ain't what we want, darlin'.

It's what we gotta do.

You see, I was sent here
to clean you of your sins.

This is all we got.

And you ain't gonna
take it from us!

No!
[yelling]

[hammer thuds]


No, Louise!

[static crackling]

[upbeat rock music]

You... shall not... murder.

Fools give full vent
to their rage.

Wise...

Bring calm in the end.

Lord, forgive me...

of my sins!

[dramatic percussion music]

[man sobbing]

[muffled groaning]

[muffled speaking]


but I know
who you are, Tommy Johnson.

[Tommy gasps]


What's that, Tommy?
Let me go! [groans]

I can't hear you.
Let me go, let me go.



Who are you,
and how do you know my name?

dissolve you of your sins.

What...?

What does it mean?

[whispering indistinct]



Does that name ring a bell?

I've been following you
for quite some time, Tommy.

I finally found out
what no one else could.

Help me!
After all these years.


[film projector whirring]

[Tommy gibbering]


I'm so sorry.

Please!


[muted dialogue]

Time to go!


[Tommy sobbing]

[Tommy groaning]

It was... it wasn't me.
I did...

I didn't do it,
I didn't do it, I didn't do it.

Hey, Uncle Jed.

Hello, Unc!
Is that you, Tommy?

[muted dialogue]


I had him...
not being my fault.



Please, please, no!


As was I.

[Tommy groaning]

[muffled yelling]

[Tommy gurgling]

John Doe, Caucasian male,
early to mid-70s.

Victim was strangled,
seemed personal.

Dead at least a week or so,

the body left
in almost a staged manner,

as though the killer
wanted our John Doe to be found.

[man] Detective. Detective.
Yeah?

You should come down.

The coroner's here
to pick up the body, sir.

All right, I'll be right there.
All right.

she says, "Enough."

I can't figure her out.
What are you gonna do?

I don't know, we'll see what
happens, all right?

All right.
Oh, and by the way,

I want you to do me a favor.

Hm?
Take care of the paperwork

on this case... [mutters]

[sighs]
Don't give me no shush.

[grunts]
Come on, I got two cases coming up.

I gotta go out of town.

Take care of this for me,

and I'll take care of you
next week...

I'm not doing any more paperwork after that.
No, just...

No papers on another case.
Of course not.

I'll reward you,
all right, just do this.

All right? Thank you.
Yeah.

All right.
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

All right, you got it.
All right.

Hey, Guz.
Yeah?

Good job today.
I'll see you later.

See you tomorrow, drive safe.

[engine starts]

"The property was left to you
by your father."

My father...
What the heck is this?

"Go to 1382 River Drive,
bah-bah bah-bah bah-bah bah,

ask for Willy, he'll give you
directions to the old inn."

Thirteen eighty-two.

A thousand miles away.


Well, road trip it is then.

[man indistinct]


You're in our way, move!

Hey!

Yo, what's your problem, dude?

My girl's having a baby,
man, move!

All right...
All right, I'm moving now.

Thanks, mister!

[engine starts]
[grinder whirring]

Can I help you, son?

Yeah, I'm looking for Willy.

You found him.

Um, looking for
the old Johnson Inn.

I'm coming around, hold on now.

All right.

[grinder whirring]

Hey.
You scared me.

Well, good luck to you, son.

And I'm sorry for my grandson,

but his girlfriend's
about ready to burst.

Good luck with that.

[engine stalling]

Goddamnit, come on!

Not now, not now!

[horn honks]
Fuck!

[sighs]
[horn honks]

What's the matter?

What's the matter?

This damn truck
is what's the matter!

It's all I got, it's everything.


Junior, why don't you
take him down to Miller's B&B?

Bed and breakfast.

Yeah, I know
what it means, thank you.

I thought that's where
the Johnson's live.

Miller's bought it
ten years back.

I'll be right back.

huh, walk away?

Soon as we get
an update on your truck,

we'll give you a call
and let you know.

[door beeps]

Hello?

Hello, anyone home?

Gonna rob your house.

What the heck is this place?

Oh, shit, coffin plane.

"Louise Lee, 45 years old,

was remembered by family,
friends as a beautiful soul.

Sources say her and her husband
had a checkered past

but recently moved last year
to pursue a better life

for themselves and their son.

No motive or arrests
have emerged yet."

Wow.

Looks like Louise
must've pissed somebody off.

[faint squeaking]

Anybody there?

[door creaking]

What the heck is this place?


[crickets chirping]

You Jason?

Uh, who's asking?

Willy called, said your car's
gonna be another day or two.

What? What-what happened?

What happened to the car?
Ignition plate blew.

But don't worry,
he bought you another one.

Uh, by the way, I'm Nisha.

My family owns the property.

I mean, how-how am I gonna pay for
this, where am I gonna sleep?

I was planning on
sleeping in there.

what I'm gonna do.

You want a drink?


Hell, yeah.

[both laugh]
Please, thank you.

Have a seat, got this.

For you.
Thanks.

It's just been one of those days
where you just kind of like, uh,

you drive your car
into oncoming traffic.

Except you don't have a car.

Yeah, exactly.
[laughs]

Now I have to get rides from
people that smell really bad

or just walk
in this humidity.

Yeah.
Oh.

Anyway, cheers?
Cheers.

Okay.

Yes, very bad.
To everything. Oh...

If you don't mind.

Let me lay back.

So where are you from, Jason...

Jason Brooks.

Guess, where am I from?

Where do you think I'm from?

Wisconsin.
No, actually,

I'm from, like, all over.

All over?
Yeah.

I jumped from foster home
to foster home to foster home...

before this nice couple,
the Brooks, they adopted me.

Then when I turned 18,

that's when I went searching
for my real parents.

Mm-hm.

[soft chuckle]

Because that's when I found out

that my mom was killed
in a car accident.

And then, uh,
then my father gave me up.



But, uh...

Johnson. Yeah.

You okay?
Yeah, no, I'm good, thanks.

Uh... Hey, what... [chuckles]

What is up with that
haunted house back there?

What's...
Well, technically, we don't own it.

Right.
It's been here

since the last family lived
here, and they owned it.

My uncle tried to remodel it,

but the family
that lived there before

threatened to sue,
so we left it untouched.

Hey, sorry, do you mind if I just
kinda sleep out here for the night?

I already told you you can
sleep in one of the open rooms.

I think room nine
is under construction,

but you can sleep there.

Are you sure it's cool?

Yeah.
Are you sure?

Fine.
All right, thank you.

Mm-hmm.

Oh.

Okay, see,
that there was a mistake.

Yeah.
That was a lot at once.

I mean,
I gave you my good stuff too.

Yeah, sorry.

Well, if you don't mind, just...
If you just...

Oh, yeah. Mm-hm.
I appreciate it. Thank you.

[upbeat music playing]

[muted dialogue]

[Jason muttering]


Should've kept her quiet, Walt.

We're the only place in town!

You can't take it from us!

You... You won't!


Help! Help me!




[birds chirping]

Nah, that'd be bad.
[man] Jason!

Jason.
Yeah.

Just leave 'em here?
[man] Yeah.

Got a little, uh, crazy last night.


You hungry?

I'm hungover.
[man] Mm, sit down.

Scramble some eggs,
I'll make you a plate.

Okay.

Oh, uh, Willy called,
said your ignition plate

will be in this evening.

Oh, thank God, thank you.

[clears throat]

Oh, hey, where's Nisha?

You're probably dehydrated.

Drink up.

What's with the spoon?

I put some lemon juice in there.
It'll help with the hangover.

And Nisha went into town
to visit her grandma.

Mm-hm.

Look, I'm gonna run now.

I'll be outta town
for a couple of days.

Nisha'll be back later.

You feel free to hang out
till your truck is ready, okay?

Uh, excuse me, sir?
Hm?

Um, look, thank you again
for your hospitality.

I appreciate it.

Uh, doesn't happen
so often around here.

Also, look, uh...

I don't really got much on me,

but I can try
and reimburse you soon.

Soon. And I was thinking,
you know,

maybe I can stick around
a couple of extra days

and help Nisha out, you know,
while you're... while you're gone.

You done enough already.

You cleaned up out back,
remember?

Oh.
[both laughing]

That was... that was, the voice, you scared me.
[both laughing]

Luke, I am your father.
See, that-that...

That would scare somebody.
[laughs]

It's fine, eat up.

All right, thank you.
Mm-hmm.


Help! Somebody help me!

What-what do you want from me?

Who are you?!

do you know who you are?

You come from a long line
of evil people.

Bad people... [indistinct]

Wait, look-look, I saw...
I saw what happened, all right?

I'm sorry for what happened!
I'm sorry, okay?

I'm sorry,
but what do you want from me?

Where... Where are you going?

Where are you going?!

What does this
have to do with me?

Please, let me go!


Louise must've
pissed somebody off.

Louise must've
pissed somebody off.

You can't take it from us,
you-you won't!

I jumped from foster home
to foster home.

My mom was killed
in a car accident.

Mm-hm. And then, uh,
then my father gave me up.

"The property was
left to you by your father."

"The property was left to you
by your father."


[hammer thuds]

Johnson!

[hammer thuds]

There hasn't been a murder
around here in 40 years.

I should've
known better back then.

[metal clanking]


So who'd you piss off now there,
Mr. John Doe?

Who'd you piss off?

[metal clanging]

Yeah, Johnson,
how you doing, it's Dakota.

Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

Listen, uh...

you find anything on this-this
old John Doe we found last week?

Right. Hey, man, look,
I know all this already, okay.

But it... I
get it, it's personal.

You know, the body
was left in a staged manner.

All I wanna know is do we have a
positive ID on the guy, that's all.

You got nothing, okay.

Well, why don't you call me
when you do, all right.

All right, anytime
between now and Christmas.


Earth to Dakota!
What?

Can't you see
I'm working over here?

You know he's getting out today.

Who?

[gavel taps]
[man] Court's in session.

Beau Johnson,
you've served 25 years

of a 25 to 40 year sentence.

The court and the parole board

finds you have met the
requirements for early release.

The court will begin
the necessary paperwork today

for your early release.

We'll inform
your lawyer later today

of the date of your release.

Court is adjourned.

So he finally got paroled, huh?


Told you
you would get you paroled.

Who loves ya, huh?

It's about time, Johnny.

I paid you enough money, man.

You should not be
walking outta this place.

Do you realize how many strings
I pulled to get you free?

I'm the one
who did you a favor, asshole.

Just have my money.

You'll be out next week.


Johnson, stop right there.

Get your hands up.

I said
get your hands up, higher!

Don't turn around.

Turn around again, get shot.


Oh, son of a bitch!

they totally screwed up,

and I was going
right back inside.

Bobby D.
Oh, good to see ya.

Oh, just the guy
I wanted to see.

[energetic rock music]


Good to have my freedom back.

Cheers.


So what do you know
about my brother?

I haven't heard from him
in years.

I was hoping you
weren't gonna bring this up,

but last I heard,
he was 302'ed a while back.

So you...
I wanted to tell you.

You were facing
the parole board, I...

Yeah, he was never the same

after Pop killed himself.

I don't know why he can't
just leave it in the past.

Dump it there, I did.

He's not like you, bro. You know that.
Yeah.

Don't, don't.
Don't waste your time with them.

They're with
those jerk-offs out back.

Nah. Watch.

[indistinct chatter]

What the heck do you think
you're doing, asshole?

Shut your mouth, I was gonna
buy you another drink.

Right.

What are you thinkin',
Grizzly Adams?

What about you, girlie,
you want a drink?

Come on.
Something else maybe.

You would love it.

You will be sore, though,
I'll tell you that.

[scoffs]
Come on, let me get you a drink.


[man 1] Yo, yo!
[man 2] Yo, yo!

Yo! Yo, asshole,
got a problem with my girl?

Nope.
Yo, asshole!

No problem, no problem.

All right, good.
You got a problem with her,

you got a problem with me, bro.

Got it?
No problem.

I was just offering
to buy her a drink, that's all.

Why don't you buy your
little bitch boy over there,

Bobby, a drink
and leave me and my girl alone.

I saw you
eyeing her up out back.

All right.
That's what I thought.


[mutters]
Are you crazy, man?

You just home.

You messed with
the wrong crew, bro.

Get outta here,
get outta here!

You're always
pushing my customers away!

Me?
Fine, we're out.

Not you, them.

All right.

You messed with
the wrong crew, bro.

Bobby, keep your boy
in check.

Get out, asshole.
[scoffs] Oh, Roy.

bring that shit out, come on.

You're lucky I'm on parole.

Come on out.
You're lucky.

Come on outside, man.
You're lucky, bro.

Come on, come on.
You too, man.

You're lucky, bro.
Yeah, right here.

I'll see you later.
Come on, bro.

Yeah, you two.
Yeah, and she's leaving with me, bitch.

Yeah, come on.
Yeah, I'll be seeing you at the mill.



[Beau] Oh!
[man] Hey!

Todd!
Hey, what's going on, big guy?

I haven't seen you
in forever, man.

It's been forever,
good to be out.

Here's the 20.
From back then, you remember?

Yes, I never forget.

You're a trip, good man.
Todd, what's your last name?

Risto.
Oh, yeah, right.

[both laughing]

Good try, good try.
Good to see ya.

[coughs] Excuse me. Don't mind him.
He's a trip.

These are on the house, guys.

Thanks, bro.
You got it.

Thank you.

It's good stuff.

Can I buy you another one, stud?

What am I, chopped liver?


Yeah.

One more, bro,
then you gotta go.

Four AM gets here too early,

and I don't... I don't need
another hit and run charge.

I'll give him a ride,
don't worry about it.

[blues music playing]

All right,
I'm gonna take off.

Here's your key,
little extra cash.

All I can say is,
one lucky bastard.

Hey, you take care of him.

[blues music fades

stayed in jail, Beau.

You would've been safer.

<i>The parole board
may have forgiven you,</i>

<i>but I never will.</i>


I'm gonna get outta here.

[man laughs]
And when I do, I'm gonna kill you.


I shoulda kicked your ass
back at that bar.


you're gonna wish I was
that biker at the bar.

Where are you going?

Get back here!

Get back over here, you bitch!
Come here!


<i>Say no.</i>

Say no
when I'm tempted to surrender

<i>to harmful things.</i>

[rock music playing]

Beau Bedford.

[Beau grunting, wheezing]

You got anything?

This is fresh blood,
he still has his socks on.

Hm.

[phone ringing]

Yeah?
Yeah, it's our boy, Detective.

Me and the kid just got done
securing the area

about a half hour ago.

We're just giving it
last looks now.

Okay, see you soon.

He'll be here shortly.

Hey, Dak.

What's going on?

How are you?
Let me tell you something.

You guys did
a real good job today.

I'm really proud of you,
you know that?

Thank you.

Here's the next assignment.

The station called, right,

and that... the bartender who
was on duty yesterday with Beau,

he's gonna come down
and answer some questions.

All right? We need that.
Okay.

What about the biker?

Do we know where him
and his friends are?

The bikers?
The bikers are in jail.

They screwed up.

Right after they left
Beau and Bobby,

after they had the fight
at the bar,

they went to another bar,
and guess what?

What?
Big surprise.

They got into another fight.

What are you gonna do?
All right.

So let's go down to the station,

check out this bartender,
see if he knows anything.

Understand?
Sounds like a plan.

Sure does.

[knocking on door]

Yeah, it's open.

the bartender's here.

You want me to send him in?

Uh, give me two minutes, okay?


[knocking on door]


Thanks, kid.

[bartender sighs]

What's up?
We got a hold of Bobby.

He's gonna come in.
Right, right.

too happy, either.

That's understandable, thanks.

Okay, so, uh...

Let's see what we have here.

So I understand that, uh,
you were working on the day

that Beau Johnson
came to your place.

Is that correct?

Excuse me, uh,
I didn't get your full name.

Dre.

Andre Miller, sir.

Okay, well,
I'm Detective Dakota, Andre.

Yeah.
That's what you can call me.

Okay. Okay, Detective Dakota.

What am I doing here,
what's this all about?

I got two words for you:

Beau...

Johnson.

And who's that?

Who's that?
Yeah.

Beau Johnson was found
murdered this morning.

Well, I didn't do it,
so, what's...?

[soft chuckle]

Well, I think he was
drinking at your bar yesterday.

You were on duty, right?

Yeah, but I get a lot
of customers every shift,

so, what's...?

Well, come on, I mean,
there was a big fight yesterday.

You had to notice the fight.

He was involved,
he knocked out a biker.

Come on, man,
you didn't see this?

Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know who you mean.

I just hadn't heard
that he was murdered.

Right.

So what happened?

Well, if I knew what happened,

then we wouldn't be here
having this meeting.

trying to help you out.

Yeah, I get that,
I understand that.

I appreciate that, but you know,

all I wanna do is get to the...
get to the bottom of this.

I mean, I just want to know
was there anything peculiar,

anything particular
that went on with Beau

when he had his friend Bobby
come in with him?

He did come in with him, right,
his friend Bobby?

Yeah. No, I mean,
Bobby D. was there

with this Beau guy
you're talking about.

Right.
They threw back some shots,

flirted with some girls
at the bar.

Then the fight broke out,
as you know,

and, uh, that's pretty much it.

You think these bikers might've
had something to do with it?

I mean, they...

Yeah, absolutely.

'Cause I know
after they left your bar,

they went over
to the Old Eagle Inn,

got themselves in a little
trouble over there,

got into another fight,

but the cops were there,
luckily.

Took 'em away, case closed.

But something's bothering me.

Why didn't you call us, I mean,
to fill out a report?

I mean, that would've been the
obvious thing to do, don't you think?

Look, Miss Wendy,
as you know, is the bar owner.

She broke up the fight and she
didn't want to involve you.

She signs my check, so...

[knocking on door]

Yeah?

Detective, Bobby D's here, sir.

Okay, two minutes.
All right.

I only have
one more question to ask you.

When Beau left the bar
after the fight,

did you see anything,
anybody go with him?

Was he by himself?

There was a girl.

A girl?
Yeah.

What, the biker girl again?

No, no, no, no,
there was another girl,

a real hot filly.

Um, she paid with cash, and, uh,

she bought Bobby
and this other guy a shot.

Then Bobby left, and, uh,
they stayed and continued to party.

So, that's about
all I can remember.

Okay, well, listen, Andre,

I appreciate you
coming down here today.

You were...
you were a lot of help, and, uh...

If I need you, I will call you.

All right.
Thank you again.

How'd he get killed,
Detective?

You don't wanna know.

It wasn't pretty.

Poor bastard.

You take it easy.
All right.


Well, look who it is,
Bobby D.

Mm-hm.

try to get comfortable.

Can I offer you anything?

I tell you what, why don't you
just cut the shit?

My best friend just died
and you call me in here

to offer me coffee?

all right?

Your best friend in prison,
25 years in prison,

gets out and is murdered
on the first night?

That's a little crazy,
don't you think, Bobby?

Something going on here.

I'm the one that should be
doing the talking

and asking the questions here.

You been through this before.

You know the routine,
you know the setup.

Yeah, I have been here before.

Why don't you just
tell me what you wanna hear

or what you wanna know,

and this way,
I can get outta here

and go home and make
the funeral arrangements

for my best friend
that just died.

Listen, he wasn't the best guy,
you know that.

And I'm not either,
so just ask your questions.

Tell me, Bobby,
tell me the truth now.

Anybody on the inside

that might've wanted
to come after Beau

when he got out of prison?

No, not that I know of.

Everybody liked us.

If someone wanted him dead,

he would've been dead on the
inside, but this is different.

How was he killed, Detective?
How?

I'd say it looks pretty personal
to me, don't you think?

Somebody wanted
a vendetta on him.

Enough to...
to poke something

through his neck
in his carotid artery.

Sounds a little
suspicious there, Bobby.

You know, Bobby,

I was reading
all your reports on the inside.

You know what I found out?

You took the fall.

You took the fall for Beau,
didn't you?

Beau broke one of our
correctional officer's arms.

He claimed it was self-defense,
but come on, Bobby.

Both you and I
know that wasn't true.

You and I
know what really happened.

He blamed you, Bobby.

He said it was your idea.

And you did a... extra two years
for that, didn't you, huh?

Yeah, I did.

And actually, what bothers me,
I read in the report

that you said,
"I'm gonna kill Beau."

Isn't that correct?
Yeah.

You said you
were gonna kill him!

Isn't that right, Bobby?

Yeah, it is right, okay?

I was angry, man, I was pissed.

I did two extra years for him
'cause I loved him.

If he got written up again,

he woulda definitely
lost his parole.

I was not
letting that happen, man.


All right, just calm down,

I'll be right there.
Give me a couple of minutes.

It's Huck, sir.

He's been missing for two days
from the psych ward.

Wait a minute, you mean Huck,
Beau's brother?

Hey... listen, Bobby,
we're done here, okay?

Listen, it was nice seeing ya.

Just grab a coffee and doughnut
on your way out.

Why don't you take the doughnut
and give it to your sister?

Keep an eye on him, will ya.

[clock bell tolling]
Hm.

Come on, Zion,

only 14 more hours to go
then you'll be home.

I hate being away
from the kids this long.

I promised you
I'd keep them safe, sis.

They're all I got left.

I'm missing you, too.

[woman groans]

Wait, that way?

[turn signal clicking]

Hey!
[man] Hey, how are you?

Good.
Welcome to Cream King.

What can I get you, hon?

Uh, what do you recommend,
chocolate or vanilla?

I'd go with the vanilla.

All right,
large vanilla, please.

[indistinct]
No, actually, no, plain.

[horn honking]

Little bit extra for you.

Thank you.
Here you go.

There you go.
Thank you, dear. Thank you.

Thanks.
Have a good day.

Oh, you too.
Thanks.

Hey, ma'am?

Um, do you happen to know

where the Miller
Bed and Breakfast is?

I'm not even from here,
I'm so sorry.

Oh, that's okay.
Good luck!

I'll find it, thanks.

Hey, hey, sir,
are you from here?

Are you...
are you from this area?

Born and raised,
where you headed?

I'm trying to find the
Miller Bed and Breakfast.

I know it's around here.
Oh, that's an easy one.

Look, head up three lights,
hang a left on Old England Road.

Okay.
It'll be up about a mile.

Old England Road?
Old England Road.

Thank you.
You're very welcome.

Hope you get where you're going.
Take care.

[engine stalling]


Come on... don't do this!

[engine starts]
Oh, thank God.

Okay.

Old English Road.


[horn honking]

Hey.
Oh, hey.

You need a ride?
Uh, if you don't mind.

Uh, I'm only
a couple miles up the road.

Yeah, sure, I'll drop you off.

Thanks, appreciate that.

I didn't
catch your name earlier.

I'm Ty, nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you.

What... what are you doing?

You need to go.

Star, that's a cute name.

Get out of the car, creep.


Off! Get off me!

Hey! Hey! Are you okay?
No, no!

I just called the cops.

I got this, all right, go ahead.
I got this.

Miss, I heard you screaming,
you all right?

No!
She's fine, she's fine.

I asked her.

You know what,
get out the car, man.

Come on, get out the car!

Look, man, she's-
Get out here!

Leave her alone!

[engine stalling]
Dang car's not starting!

All right, calm down, calm down.

Take your time,
now start the car.

It's okay, he's gone, okay?

All right, listen, listen, listen...
[Star sobs]

I called the cops,
they're on their way, all right?

It's gonna take 'em
a little while,

but I'm right down the road.

My car's right over there, okay?

I'm Mr. Miller.
I'm a good guy, Scout's honor.

We can just wait for them
down there, okay?

Get the car towed and get
the car looked at, all right?

Just... I know you
been through a lot.

It's terrible
what he tried to do to you.

Just-just calm down,
I know you're upset.

Okay?
Okay.

Take your time.

Watch out for traffic.

Right down the road here, okay?

Watch out. It's okay.
It's over here.

Take your time.
You look rattled.

Where'd that guy
come from anyway?

I was just giving him a ride.

What? You...
A young lady by yourself

can't be picking up hitchhikers.

Here we are.

The cops are on their way.

I gave them my address,
so don't worry.

You wanna come back in the kitchen
and get something to drink?

Yeah.
Follow me.

Right through here.

Who was that creep?

He said that his name was Ty or
something when he attacked me.

I don't know,
but you're safe now.

Thanks for helping me out.

I'm Star, by the way.

Zion.

Nice to meet you, Star.

What's wrong?

the letter in the car.

It has the address
that I was going to.

It's the Bedford place,
do you know it?

Yeah, I've heard of it,

but they sold that
a few years back.

It's about a mile
or so down the road.

Maybe the cops'll take me.

You have a bathroom?

Sure, right through there
to the left.

Cops'll be here soon, sweetie.

[Star] Zion?
In here, Star.

Whoa.
Oh, I...

You okay?
Don't feel so good.

Just need to sit down.
Yeah, yeah. Sit down.

Relax.

Just gonna rest my eyes
for a sec.

Yeah, you had a rough day.

What a nice place you have.
Mm-hm.

It's good to be back.

After three weeks on the road...
start to miss home.

No, no, no!

Tommy, come back here.

[Star yelps]


Zion!

Get outta here!

[Star gasps]

[exhales, laughs]

It was just a dream.

Zion?



[mumbles]
[man] You're an evil man, Huck.

[Huck muttering]
What's that?

I can't hear you.

I can't hear you.

Who are you?

Who are you?
Who are you, Huck?

What are you doing?

What... What is that?
What are you gonna do with that?

Please, don't.

Please, don't do that.

Please!
You thought you could kill two people

and not pay for it?

You pled insanity.

Maybe the town bought it.


Please...

[muffled yell]

<i>â™ª We're the Millers â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª You turned us into killers â™ª</i>

[man shouts]
[hammer thuds]

What do you want from us?

It ain't what we want, darlin'.

It's what we gotta do.

You see, I was sent here
to clean you of your sins.

This is all we got.

And you ain't gonna
take it from us!

No!
[yells]


What is this place?

[metal clangs]



Help!




Fuck... [crying]

beautiful where you're going.

You're the last piece
of the puzzle, Star.

You come from
a long line of bad blood,

a lineage
of deplorable people.

I have to finish
what I started.

It's you.

He didn't want to do it.

No, he-he thought
that he had to do it.


You must do it.

You must.

He ordered you to do it.


He didn't want to do it.

He thought that he had to do it.
Hm.

He was ordered to do it!

As was I, Star, as was I.


[monitor beeping]

Nisha.

Must've dozed off.
When you'd get here, sweetheart?

I just got here
a couple of minutes ago.

Dre told me you took a spill.

I wanted to make sure
you were okay.

I am, thanks.

He started to tell me
what happened, everything good?

Yeah.

Detective.
What?

Can I help you
with something, Detective?

Yeah, I was just checking on
your uncle there,

seeing if he was okay.

How you doing, all right?

Listen, I was, uh...
I was in the hospital

checking up on a few things,
and I overheard some of the nurses

saying you were in here...

Heard that you took
a nasty spill last night.

Just wanted to check in on you,
see how you were doing,

see if you were all right.

Yeah, yeah, I'm doing okay.

Tough old bird.

Since when do you
check up on me like that?

He's gonna be fine,
just had a nasty cut.

They're gonna fix him up.
He'll be out of here in no time.

Looks like more than
a nasty cut to me.

I mean, I just talked to
one of the nurses.

She said they're getting
another room for you.

You're gonna be
admitted here very shortly.

Yeah, like my niece said,
I'll be fine.

Listen,
I'm gonna get going, okay?

Dre'll be here soon
to come pick you up.

Um, you gonna be all right?

Yeah, I'll be all right,
baby girl.

Okay.
Take care.

Detective.
Nice meeting you.

Thanks for coming by.

You take care, Nisha.

So let me ask you something.

What were you
doing out late last night

running around the woods?

Just doesn't make sense.


Uh... deer?

Yeah.

They're getting bad around here.

I've been setting traps
and putting up fences

to keep them
from entering my property.

It's getting cold, Detective.

I'm running out of time
to harvest my veggies.


Anyway, I was checking on
my traps and my fences,

and as luck would have it,
I misstepped

and I tripped
one of my devices.

One of my own devices.

I guess karma's
a real bitch, huh?

It always catches you
in the end.

Yeah.

Yeah, karma's a bitch.

So listen, you take care
of that, uh, that leg, okay?

I'll be seeing you around.

Hey, Dakota.
What?

It's kinda crazy, huh?

There hasn't been a murder
around here in what, 40 years?

We did our best, just know that.

All these years later, what,
like four or five murders

all of a sudden just happen?

I don't know about you,
Detective,

but to me,
somebody pissed someone off.

Or maybe bad luck
just caught up with some people.

Yeah.

Hey, Mr. Miller,
how you feeling?

Ah, a little sore.
Well, I have some meds...

Thanks.
For your pain.

They'll take care of that.

Okay.
And while I'm here,

I'm going to check your wound
before we move you.

I'll let you
do what you gotta do.

You have any idea what room
they're moving me to,

so I can let my niece and nephew
know where I'm gonna be at?

Yeah, that, uh, that's...
will be room nine.


Karma, Mama.


Say again?
Uh... Just, nothing.

These meds got me loopy.

Thanks.



[Star grunting
[Zion groaning]

My grandfather didn't wanna be
a part of what happened.

I'm sorry for what happened
to your mother,

but he didn't wanna do it.


How do you know
what happened to my mother?

My grandfather wrote a journal
before he died.

He wrote everything that happened
before he killed himself.


I've had that since I was a kid.


I got a letter...

and it told me that I
inherited part of his land

and that I needed
to come in town.

I've been looking for you
this whole time.

My grandfather wrote about you.

He wrote about you.

I had no idea it was you.

I can't let you go, Star.

You come from a long line
of bad people.

I have to cleanse
your bloodline...

so it can be cured of evil.

I have to finish what I started.

[Star shouts]

talked about what happened</i>

<i>on that fateful night
in room nine.</i>

<i>But 40 years later,
someone finally did.</i>

<i>When the Johnson/Bedford place
went up for sale,</i>

<i>I bought it in my mom's honor.</i>

<i>Even though
she lost her life there,</i>

<i>she always wanted to own one,
so now she does.</i>

You know, I was thinking we should
open up a bed and breakfast.

I was digging in the garden</i>

<i>and found that hood.</i>

<i>The bogeyman.</i>

<i>And the next day, an old man stopped
by to welcome me to the neighborhood</i>

<i>and mentioned he had to get
something off his chest,</i>

<i>a secret he's been hiding
for 40 years.</i>

<i>Forty damn years!</i>

<i>That's a long time
to keep a secret.</i>

<i>My mother was killed
'cause crazy Charlie Johnson</i>

<i>overheard her saying she wanted
her own bed and breakfast.</i>

open up a bed and breakfast.

would take away his customers</i>

<i>and he would lose business,</i>

<i>so that's when he called
his brother Jed</i>

<i>and ordered her murder.</i>

<i>After old man Willy broke down
and told me his secret,</i>

<i>that he knew what happened
that night to my mom,</i>

<i>that she was killed over greed,
over damn greed!</i>

<i>But he couldn't say anything.</i>

<i>He was just too scared
to say anything.</i>

<i>Well, that's when he helped me</i>

<i>put my plan into motion.</i>

[saw whirring]

<i>I wanted them to suffer,</i>

<i>just like they made
my father suffer.</i>

<i>They killed his wife
right in front of him.</i>

<i>So I made the murder bench.</i>

<i>I would make them suffer
just like Mom did.</i>

<i>That's when I became him.</i>

<i>They created him.</i>

<i>Tommy was the first to go.</i>


<i>I had fun with him.</i>

<i>Then came Beau.</i>

<i>I had fun plunging that stake
through his throat.</i>

<i>Then came Huck.</i>

<i>I saved him for last.</i>

<i>See, good old Huck,</i>

<i>well, he killed two people,</i>

<i>my mother and my sister.</i>

<i>Sis died a couple of years back
by a drunk driver.</i>

<i>That's when I took custody
of my niece and nephew.</i>

<i>Huck pleaded innocent,</i>

<i>that it was insanity</i>

<i>and the booze
that killed my sister, not him!</i>

<i>But it was the guilt
of my mother's death</i>

<i>that turned him
into an alcoholic.</i>

<i>Now let's not forget
you and Jason.</i>

<i>I sent you two the letters
to lure you both here.</i>

<i>You see, Jason is a Johnson,</i>

<i>and you're a Bedford, Star.</i>

You're a Johnson!

<i>You see, evil is in your blood</i>

<i>and there's no help
for you, Star.</i>

I can help you, though.


Help me?

You're the last of
the Bedford/Johnson bloodline.

After I'm finished with you,
I'm done.

I have to finish
what I started.


There's more of them.

What?

My Uncle Beau had three boys

before he went to jail.

They're bad.

They're bad
like the rest of them.

They hurt people.

I wanna stop them, too.

Let me... let me help you.

We can do this together.

We can make the world
a better place.

You did what you had to do.

What any son
would do for their mother.

[Zion sighs]

It's okay.

I understand.

Dre.

I need you
to come back to the woods.

You know where.

I need to get to a hospital.

It checked out.

What? No!

Star's with me.

She needs help, too.

She's with us now.

She's one of us.

Come grab her up.

<i>â™ª We're the Millers â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They turned us into killers â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We're the Millers â™ª</i>

[both grunting]

<i>â™ª They turned us into killers â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We're the Millers â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They turned us into killers â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª They turned us into killers â™ª</i>

<i>Hello, you there?</i>

<i>Yes, it's your brother.</i>

No! No! No!
