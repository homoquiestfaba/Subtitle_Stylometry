Mr. Lombardo, what's up?

Did you see those eyes?

Fuck off!

I appreciate you guys coming down.

All I'm going to miss is...

Settle down.

We've come to the halfway point
of our senior seminars.

Beats study hall, doesn't it?
No!

That you, Jimmy?
In study hall I can meditate.

He means masturbate.
I'm sure you know all about that.

It wasn't me, man !

We've all heard the terms
"date rape", "sexual harassment".

We've discussed
some of these issues here.

Our guests today come from
the Blue Bay Police Department.

Detectives Duquette and Perez
will give us a fresh perspective -

and address your questions.
Let's give them a warm welcome.

I'm out of here.
This prick can kiss my ass.

As I was saying... We'll start with
a question. What is a sex crime?

Not getting any.

Blue Bay, fight, fight!
Buccaneers, win tonight!

Steady.

Steady the bow, Jimmy.

That's good.

Drop the main. All right, de-rig,
and I'll see you all Monday.

The Buccaneers are number one,
and don't you forget it.

Good work, guys. See you Monday.
See you, Mr. Lombardo.

All right!
I could definitely party on that.

That's a stinkpot, Jimmy.
A real boatman gets one of those.

Now... that's a real boat.

Thank you for getting me into this
class. My old man wouldn't pay.

You're working for it.
And learning about boats.

I put myself through college
working boats.

Can I play too?
Or is it just for boys?

So, who's washing your jeep this
weekend? The senior car wash !

That's a waste of time.
Not at all.

How about if Nicole and I do it?
Tell you what...

I'm going to the Glades, Saturday.
On Sunday, you wash the mud off.

Deal.

My mom should give me a ride today,
but she's not here.

So I was wondering
if you could give me one?

You wouldn't want me to walk?
Something bad might happen.

You need a lift, Jimbo?
Yes, but I got my bike.

Hey, no problem.

Try it.

Suzie, you need a lift?
We've got room.

Jesus! Where did she get the shoes?
"Whores-for-less?"

Try it again.

Nice to see you kids getting along.

Don't forget Sunday.
I won't.

Is that Sam Lombardo?
Hi, Mom !

Sam ! Hi.
Hi, Sandra.

Why don't you come in for a drink?
Sorry, Sandra, I've got to run.

Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
Hi, girls.

Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
Hi, girls.

Look, he forgot. I knew it.
No, I didn't. Check out my jeep.

Nice and dirty.
But wait until the other car leaves.

You mean
the Mercedes isn't yours, too?

My Benz is blue.
You know that, Nicole.

Sam, I'm leaving.
Where's your hose, Mr. Lombardo?

The hose, Kelly,
is in front of the jeep.

Kelly Van Ryan's
going to wash your jeep?

Come on, Barbara.
It's for a good cause.

Sam the Philanthropist!
Hard work never hurt anyone.

Have fun at the club.

Looks brand new.

Aren't you forgetting something?

Your coupon. We got to have it.
Yeah, that thing.

Can't we just...
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

Okay, let me look for it...
Mr. Lombardo? We're kind of late.

Nicole can go ahead. You can
give me a ride when you find it.

Just give me a minute.

Go!
Are you sure?

Frankie! Oh God !

Goddamn it!

This is Blue Bay High School. Your
son or daughter was absent today.

What?
Come on !

That's a hell of a fish, Art.
It's a barracuda.

If you weren't chasing booty at the
club you could have caught one, too.

You're not going to eat it?
Why not?

They're poisonous. It'll kill you.
Like most of the girls you date.

Sandra Van Ryan, for Sam.

What's up?
Kelly skipped school today.

Have you heard anything?
Not a word.

Never mind, I found her.

Pull !

Listen, Sam...
It was really good seeing you.

Look Sandra,
I'm real busy right now, so...

I haven't found anyone who can
handle my boat the way you can.

You're fucking Barbara. So what?
Maybe I'm a one-woman man now.

Poor Sam.

You really think a Blue Bay woman
will marry you?

Are you finished?
Grab a clue, Honey.

You're a hired hand, a good lay,
that's all. Enjoy it while it lasts.

Bye, Sandra.

Pull !

You seem to find guns therapeutic.
Maybe I ought to try it.

Let me guess. Some boy didn't call,
and screwed up your weekend?

So you're taking the day off.

Which of your deckhands is that?
Whichever one I want.

Okay, Kelly.
What's the matter?

What is it?

I miss Dad.
Jesus.

I miss him too. Sometimes.
No, you don't.

He didn't have to kill himself,
Kelly.

Kelly...

I...

I don't know why he did it.

I really don't.

Can l...

Can I get you anything?
Do you want a valium?

I was raped.
What, Honey? I can't hear you.

I said I was raped.
What?

I was raped...

... by Sam Lombardo.

Sam Lombardo?

My daughter does not get raped !
And you say Sam Lombardo did it?

That son of a bitch must be insane
to think he can do this to me.

We understand your feelings,
but we need some time with Kelly, -

to take her statement alone.

Are you all right with this, Baby?
Yeah.

Would you like to take a break
for a minute?

I just want to get it over with.

We'd like to video your statement.
These are serious charges.

We must know everything
that happened. Are you ready?

He started rubbing my shoulders.

I let him.
I mean, he's a nice guy.

The next thing...

... his hand was in my shorts.

You know, from behind.

His fingers...

His fingers...
Take your time.

They were in me.
Both places, you know?

Did he put himself inside you?
Yes.

I said "stop", I screamed. I mean,
that's how it sounded in my head.

He hurt me.
Did you try to fight him?

He pinned my wrists behind me.
Then what?

He kept saying,
"Let it happen, let it happen. "

And then he just stopped.
You mean, he withdrew?

It's really hard to remember.
Try, Kelly.

I know one thing he said.
He said:

"Don't worry, I didn't come. "

I can't forget that.

He said, "No little girl can ever
make me come. "

"No little girl can ever
make me come." Jesus!

Too bad, we might have had
some physical evidence.

Maybe there's no physical evidence
because nothing happened.

I think she's acting.

She set it up to be alone with him,
so he could come on. But he didn't.

Maybe, maybe not. He should
never have had her out there.

Gloria, he's done half
the women in Blue Bay.

That doesn't make him a rapist.
She could take a polygraph.

And the Pope could take a piss test.
This is Blue Bay.

Ask a Van Ryan for that
and Tom Baxter will cut you off.

You're afraid of Tom Baxter now?
Or Sandra Van Ryan?

Talk to his neighbours,
his co-workers and Kelly's friends.

This will destroy Lombardo.
You heard her. The guy's dirty.

Bring me a case.

Good work, Jimbo.
I'll see you Monday.

That's what's left
of my sailing class.

Talk to me, Artie.
Kelly is accusing you of rape.

Jimmy told me.
Apparently I'm the last one to know.

Sandra Van Ryan has been ringing
every member of the school board.

She's pushing for suspension.
And they won't hear my side?

This is insane.
I'm innocent, goddammit!

You've got to believe that.
Just hang in there.

When they clear you...
You never get clear of this.

It stays with you.
It follows you around forever.

You're going to need some help, Sam.
An attorney.

And what attorney in South Florida
will go up against the Van Ryans?

Hi. I'm here to see Ken Bowden.

Do you have an appointment?
Yeah, Sam Lombardo.

Mr. Bowden, your 1 0:30's here.
Show him in, please.

What brings you here?

Until yesterday, I was a guidance
counsellor at Blue Bay High School.

A student is accusing me of rape.
Male or female?

The student is Kelly Van Ryan.
Which means, I'm fucked.

Why don't you tell me about it?
Shit, where do I begin?

Your relationship with the girl.

She's a student, I was her
guidance counsellor, that's all.

Then you've got nothing
to worry about.

What happened to your neck?
This? I don't have to wear it.

There was an insurance guy
around earlier.

Let me tell you how I charge.

Georgie!
How's the wind today?

Mr. Lombardo, I'm afraid
I can't park for you today.

I'm meeting Barbara for lunch.

Can you park this, Georgie?
Right away, Mr. Baxter.

You're finished here, Lombardo.
Take a hike.

Barbara, what's going on?

Maybe you didn't hear me, Lombardo.
You're finished in Blue Bay.

If you see my daughter again,
you'll be finished, period.

Get the fuck out of here.
Mr. Lombardo, please...

It's all right, George.

Sam, Honey!
Haven't seen you in a while.

Welcome back.
Rum and coke.

Are you all right?
I'm fine.

That's too bad, motherfucker.

Sam?

Lombardo?

Whoa, man !
It's me.

Sorry, man.
Things have been a bit weird here.

I can see that.

Come on in.

You're sure this Frankie Condo
is the guy that did it?

It was him. He was driving
Sandra's Range Rover.

Tell the cops, and we can go
after Sandra Van Ryan.

Forget it.
The lady has deep pockets.

I know how deep her pockets are.
I thought I might save my house...

But guess who's on the
board of directors at the bank?

I don't need more trouble from her.
Do you think I can stop her?

With the shit I got on Kelly?
Yeah.

A year ago, when her old man shot
himself, Kelly lost it, ran away.

They found her in a fleabag motel.
Coked out of her gourd.

Meanwhile you, Sam, are voted
"Educator of the Year" or some crap.

If they put the two of you in front
of a jury, they'll look stupid.

They haven't taken your statement,
because they're looking for dirt.

And they're not going to find it.

Right?

Ken, I don't fuck my students.

He's just showing off for you now.

Good evening, Ruby.
I see you've still got Walter.

I was hoping
something had eaten him by now.

Can I help you with something?
Suzie called us. Where is she?

You know the way.

You won't shoot her, will you?

I don't believe she's armed.

It took you long enough !
What if I was being strangled?

Or fucked in the ass, even?

I mean, you do sex crimes, right?
My partner, Detective Perez.

CÃ©line. He had a good line
on what cheap fucks people are.

Suzie, you called us, remember?

Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?
No.

Will they?
I don't know.

That bothers you?

I want to go outside.

When did he give you this ride?
About a year ago.

Was anyone else at your trailer?
Nope.

So you were alone?
Yeah.

Did he come in with you?
I guess.

Did he or didn't he?
Okay. Yeah, he did.

Then what? Did he touch you?
Did you flirt with him?

Suzie, I know you feel bad.
Just tell us the truth.

I didn't say a thing to him.

He put his arm around me
and told me I was pretty.

I could be really pretty, he said.
Did you ask him to stop?

Shit! What difference does it make?
No one will believe me anyway.

Did Sam Lombardo rape you?
He did. He pushed me to the floor.

Now, are we done?
Almost, Suzie, almost.

Could you fight him off?

No. He stopped by himself.

Is that it?
Leave me alone.

Don't touch me!
All right, take it easy.

He stopped. And that was it?
He just left?

Yeah. He did say one thing first.
What was that?

He said, "No little bitch
can ever make me come."

Open the gate.

Look at this girlfriend.

Counsellor, how about a smoke?
Hello, Jinxy.

It's a bad news/good news situation.

No bail, but you get a real attorney
instead of a public defender.

I'm telling you, Ken.
I'm innocent.

You are preaching to the choir.
You're not alone.

So you're the new chicken-licker?

Any comment on the case?
What are your feelings?

Mr. Lombardo
will get what he deserves.

Feeling confident?
Yes.

The Lombardo case
has galvanised this upscale town.

Here's Sandra Van Ryan, millionaire
heiress from the Blue Bay elite.

And the girl from skid row.

The jury must choose between these
girls' stories, and Sam Lombardo's.

Live at the courthouse,
Nancy Duerr, Eyewitness News.

State of Florida vs. Sam Lombardo.
Sylvia B. Waxman presiding.

All rise.

Please be seated.

Would you like more time, Kelly?

I know this is hard, Kelly,
but I have one more question.

And even though we've been over it,
I want us all to be clear about it.

Kelly, when you saw Mr. Lombardo
intended to have sex with you...

... what were your exact words?
What did you say?

I told him, "No."

I said,
"Stop, Mr. Lombardo, please."

I screamed for him to stop.

You screamed, for him...

... to stop.
And did he?

No.

He raped me
on the floor of his shitty house.

Thank you.

On day two, the second alleged
young victim has taken the stand.

Yesterday, Kelly Van Ryan
gave an emotional account -

and was not swayed
by cross-examination.

We'll be back later with an update.

Good morning.

Miss, when you were picked up
for shoplifting in freshman year -

you were allowed to make one call.
You called Mr. Lombardo, correct?

Miss Toller?

And when you were expelled
for vandalism...

I broke a fucking window.
It wasn't my fault.

Wait until you are asked, and
don't use profanity in this court.

It was Mr. Lombardo who went with
you, in lieu of a parent conference?

Yes.

It seems to me
that Mr. Lombardo was your friend.

He was.

But all that changed, when, -

according to your testimony,
Mr. Lombardo raped you -

on April 23rd of last year.
Is that right?

But in May, when you were
arrested for possessing narcotics, -

and again allowed a phone call,
you called Mr. Lombardo.

So what?
"So what?"

"So what?"

Oops, Suzie.

One month after you say this man
raped you, you go to him for help?

It sounds like
you still considered him a friend.

I needed help.
I'm sure you did. But he was gone.

And you spent six months
in a correctional facility.

Did that make you mad, Suzie? That
Sam was gone? That he wasn't there?

Is that why you're saying this?
I said it, because it happened.

Are you going to sit there and swear
Sam Lombardo raped you?

I said he did.
Let me ask you a question.

Did you enjoy
being a guest of the state?

I promise you that if you're lying,
as I believe you are, -

you'll visit that facility again.

Which is why I'll ask you again,
under oath:

Suzie,
did Samuel Lombardo rape you?

Miss Toller,
you must answer the question.

Miss Toller...
Goddamn it!

This was not my idea.
Objection ! Defence is badgering.

The court will hear
what Miss Toller has to say.

Miss Toller?

Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.
He didn't rape Kelly, either.

This is ridiculous!
The witness has been threatened...

This court intends to hear
Miss Toller's story.

Miss Toller?

I just wanted to hurt Mr. Lombardo.

I mean, he was my friend, at first.

When I got busted he didn't help me.
I went to that hell-hole.

First favourite, then who cares?
Make her stop.

When Kelly said we should do this,
I thought, "Cool."

Big shots who screwed me over,
like Duquette, will get screwed.

I'm sorry, I have to object.
Your honour, may I be heard?

Mr. Baxter,
you are not trying this case.

Go sit down.

Kelly is pissed at Mr. Lombardo,
too. She's in love with him.

He was her fantasy, but then she
found out he was doing her mom.

Fuck!
You skanky bitch !

Get your fucking hands off me.
I'll have you fired !

Just get the hell away from me.

Jesus, man, cut loose!
I'm just wondering where to stay.

I've lost my house.
I'm waking up from a nightmare.

Get over it. We've got an airtight
lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.

Just like that?
These people ruined your life.

I told you they would go too far.
They went overboard !

They'll settle. Believe me,
they'll be begging to settle.

Here we go.
Wait up! Come on, girl.

Sam Lombardo was dismissed when
a victim reversed her testimony.

Excuse me, over here!
Can anybody read?

Nail that shyster's balls
to the nearest wall.

That was possible, until Miss Not
So Bright started throwing things.

Are you just going to let them
get away with this... shit?

On the word
of a white trash bitch.

I don't think you get it, Sandy.
Your princess committed perjury.

I'll try to keep her out of jail.
What are we going to do?

Here's your coffee, Sam.
Thank you.

Ken...

Sorry I'm late.

Hold my calls, Lenore.
Okay, Mr. Bowden.

Thank you, Sandra.

I'll be seeing you.
Okay?

Nice to see you, Tom.
Come by, we'll have lunch.

See you at the club.
