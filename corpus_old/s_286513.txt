Lots of snow!

Terrific! Not melted yet!

We came for a memorial service.
Not to go skiing.

Mama, you also want to ski, right?

0h, I want to ski!
I'm dying to ski!

I can't wait to see Yoshimi.

Spring vacation's great.
No homework.

I thought you grew out of that.

My lucky charm.

It's so cute...
Give it to me.

Nope.

Look out!

Heisuke Sugita
Naoko
Monami

Rescued passengers
are badly injured.

Most in critical condition.

The latest report...

Regarding the mother and
daughter in the hospital...

They have been identified as,

Mrs. Sugita and her daughter.

The two women brought to
this hospital...

have been identified.

Their family name is Sugita.

We'll be going now.

Try to shave clean.

Bye, now!

I'm Sugita.
Where's my wife and daughter?

Sugita? The trauma
section upstairs.

The trauma section.

Heisuke!

I don't know what to say...

If only I hadn't asked
them to come...

Doctor, doctor...

Mr. Sugita?

Yes.

Will they make it?

I'm afraid it's very critical.

You mean my wife...
or my daughter?

Both of them.

Doctor, the mother's VF!

Bosumin!

Hold on! What?

What?

Monami?

Don't worry.

She's right next to you.

Nurse... Help me.

Naoko!

Hold on!

Naoko!

Naoko!

Naoko!

Naoko!

Mama...

This way please.

Naoko...

Monami...

Monami.

You're awake...

What?

Am I... dead?

Monami.

You're alive!

I'll get the doctor!

Wait, Heisuke.

It's me, Naoko.

What?

What are you saying?

Monami.

Heisuke...

I'm Naoko.

H i m i t s u -

What are you saying?

Are you all right, Monami?

No.
I'm Naoko.

Can't you see?

No! It's impossible.

I can't believe it myself.

But it's true.

Now, don't kid daddy.

I'm not.

No.

Then, tell me about
the first date we had.

We ate ice cream
at the Cape Lighthouse.

And then?

We went to Chinatown.

You ate 5 dishes of noodles in soup.

Different kinds of noodles.

Also fried noodles.

And do you remember the night
you spent at my place?

Yes,

It was winter.

While we were doing it
you were so clumsy.

You had a leg cramp.
A big commotion.

Tell me, are you still alive?

Naoko...

Naoko?

Does it mean that Monami
is the one who is dead?

I took over Monami's body.

If it's possible to bring Monami
back...

I'll do whatever it takes.

For now...

Better not tell anyone.

Heisuke...

What'll I do now?

I'm home.

Wow, what a mess.

Heisuke, open the window.

It's pretty awkward.

Heisuke, did you water them?

Sometimes.

I knew it.

They're withering.
The poor things.

Drink lots of water.

There!

Come on, pep up!

Now you'll revive.

Heisuke, come and help me.

Heisuke...

Am I in a dream?

Will you be all right alone?

I'll be fine.

You missed some.

So, you're Naoko.

See you later.

I'll see you later.

A little bland.

But chief, we thought a mild
flavor would sell better.

Chinese noodles must taste
good from the first bite.

So-called mild soy sauce
contains a lot of salt.

Yes...

It has a good broth flavor.

A little more effort.

And the noodles.

I'm confident of that.

I think the chief
looks pretty weary.

After what happened,
of course.

Come on! Get up!
You'll be late.

5 more minutes.

No! Get up!

No!
I want to sleep more

Get up right now.
You hear me?

Stop it!

I'll sleep with you.

Research of
possession phenomenon,

By religion, natural
science and psychology,

continues extensively...

There is an interesting case.

It happened to a girl in France.

She had smallpox...

And was in a state of
suspended death...

She recovered with another
person's personality.

A woman who died
at about the same time,

Was believed to have
possessed the girl.

It's green! Look! Look!

The girl knew everything
about the dead woman.

her condition lasted
for two years.

Then, the girl's true
personality returned.

I'm home.

She must be Naoko

Monami...

It's me, Naoko.

Hi, there.

What in the...?

Look like a teenager?

Maybe the skirt is too short?

No...

Stop staring, Heisuke.

Cut it out!

I can't help it.

Heisuke!

Stop it...

See?

Heisuke.

You know what I think?

I should be Monami when
we're outside the house.

It's an idea...

We don't have a choice.

Being your wife in
the house won't change.

Right.

I can't keep wearing this ring.

From now on this will be
my wedding ring

I'll keep mine on.

That's nice of you.

But...

You're over 40, can you
be a high school girl?

I can... I can!

That's already out of date.

You've got to get busy
with a lot of catching up.

Now, go to sleep.

We're a real weird couple.

Ah, shut up.

This sure brings
back memories.

Monami!

Why, hello.

Are you all right now?

Kuniko?

Gee, you grew up.

Same class?

What's with your skirt?

What?

It's too long.

Are you feeling better?
Just take it easy, okay?

Smile.

Yeah, thanks.

Let's go.

She's gone through this terrible
trauma...

She forgets
faces and names.

I see...

She might find it very
hard to keep up in class.

A new term is starting.

She's a good student.
She'll be fine.

No, I don't really think so.

I'm sure she can't even
socialize with anyone.

Don't worry about
her in school.

Yes...

Good morning.

Monami!

You're... 0dajima, right?

Ah, yes.

I'm glad you're with us.

Me too.

I sure am glad.

Why'd you bother with him?

He was a classmate before.

So, you talked to him?

Could you ignore him?

I guess not.

Monami!

Long time no see.

The second function...

f (x) equals...

a x squared plus...

b x plus c...

Find the value of the
constant a, b, c.

I give up.

Help me, Monami.

Anyone have the answer?

Miss Sugita.

You mean... me?

Yes.

I'll wash your back.

No thanks.

Why?

It's just...

Come on, I always do.

Yeah, right.

You're Naoko, yeah.

How's school?

Exhausting.

Kids are all around me.

That's natural.

Something's weird.

What?

I thought math was
beyond me completely,

But it's easy to come
up with answers.

The conscious mind is yours,
but the brain is Monami's.

The brain determines
talent and ability.

You and Monami have the
same thought patterns.

Maybe that's it.

Finished.

Get in the tub.

Thanks.

Hey!

Don't be shy.

Cut it out.

Regarding indemnity...

Depending on the victim's
sex and age...

The sum will differ from
50 to 80 million yen.

Can't you get at least
100 million?

That's too cheap.

Is life that cheap?

Give my son back!

All of you have
a document...

That calculates the
formula for indemnity.

You apply it
to figure out the amount.

So, the amount can be
roughly decided.

My two sons who just
started work were killed.

They're not the same
as somebody's wife.

200 million yen each!

Well...

Do you know the
cause of the accident?

Yes.

The bus company admits
it was the driver's fault.

After a thorough inquiry?

It won't bring back the dead!

Demand a thorough check
of the accident.

It's what the people who
died want to know.

Very well.

The issue of overwork
of the driver...

And other factors to be
double checked.

Will be demanded from
the bus company.

Please do that.

I will.

Money is the least concern.

It's not the money...

0ne more thing.

The driver's son, Kajikawa,
is here.

He wishes to make an
apology to everyone.

Is it all right?

Then, Kajikawa, please.

Please accept...

I'm sorry...

That's no way to apologize.

How many people are dead?

Be more sincere.

Who do you think you are?

Your father did it!

My dad's not a murderer!

What's that?

Come back here!

Wait a minute.

You were pretty rude.

He's the one.

He calls every night.

Saying my dad's a murderer.

I recognize his voice.

No compassion for the
victim's families?

I feel sorry for them.

For you too.

But my dad didn't cause
the accident on purpose.

The bus company puts
all the blame on him.

You have other family?

No. That's why I came.

Wait...

He has an attitude.

He's having a hard time.

He's going to college?

Who knows?

If he worked overtime
for the tuition...

The victims can't rest in peace.

Who worked overtime?

The driver.

I heard him talking on the bus.

Kajikawa, it's your turn.

Yeah, sorry.

Are you all right?

I didn't sleep last night.

Driving a truck again?

You're risking your job.

But driving is the only
work I can do.

Isn't moonlighting hard?

Not too bad.

It means happiness to my
family. That's what.

Maybe he dozed off
at the wheel.

I'll do the indemnity
negotiations.

So, forget about the
accident.

Monami!

Pass it on!

Pass! Pass the ball!

Miss Sugita.

Yes.

Catch you later.

How do you feel?

I'm fine.

Take care of yourself.

Yes.

That girl's worrying about
me makes me tired.

Don't be ungrateful.
She's a fine teacher.

You're taking her side.

Silly.

But you know...

She's always watching me.

It suffocates me.
Maybe she's suspicious.

About what?

That I'm not Monami.

Silly. She's worried
about you, that's all.

That sure is a pretty
heavy meal.

I want to eat solid food,
'cause I'm young.

Young. I see.

Heisuke, what about it?

What?

Sex.

Heisuke, shame on you.

Why sex, out of the blue?

Well, we talked about
my teacher, Miss Hashimoto.

That's irrelevant.

Well, what'll you do?

What'll I do?

What can I do?

To my own daughter?

You think I can make love?

I guess not.

Mr. Sugita?

Yes?

It's been a while.

Yes, it has...

A medical school?

Yes.

It will be hard on her,
changing her subjects.

Why in the world?

You have any inkling?

No.

Shall we sit down?

Thank you.

I didn't know we
were neighbors.

I live further down
the road.

Alone?

Yes, that's right.

Is that so...

Well, now...

What's she up to
with Heisuke?

Well, I must be going.

Thank you.

Say hello to Monami.

Yes.

Good-bye.

I caught you.

You startled me.
Were you listening?

Wipe off the grin.

Who, me?

She's your type all right.

What's that mean?

You're nuts!

0uch! 0uch! .0uch!

I want to study
cerebral medicine.

I want to discover
what happened to me.

I thought so.

But can science cure it?

Maybe not, but I want
to try.

Just living and feeling
skeptical isn't easy.

I guess not.

0ne other thing...

I don't want to waste
reliving a life.

With Monami's body,
I want to do what I want.

For Monami's sake too.

I feel like I'm being
outstripped.

No good?

I'll back you up.

I can still work
for 20 more years.

Hey!

What?

Is your skirt shorter?

This is normal.

Come on.
You're over forty.

You hear? Naoko!

Naoko?

Famous foreign literature,

Tolstoi, "War and Peace".

Hey.

Naoko!

Look! Look!

Hey!

Naoko!

Be quiet!

I'm starving!

Lots of pickles,

Here! Here!

Not me!

So, the test is tomorrow.

No problem.

That's good.

Here's something we put
all our energy in.

Please.

"C0NCENTRATl0N"

If you don't pass,
there's always next year.

And another year afterwards.

If I didn't pass, then no one
passed.

You're amazing.

Look! There it is!

Where? Where?


7 0 5
Na-o-ko!

0h, I see it.

Thanks to my noodle power.

Yes? Yes!

0ne order of Sushi.

Right!

We haven't been here
for awhile.

Yeah.

Here...

It's my happiest time
to be with you like this.

Yes, it is.

Say, Heisuke.

If you fancy that girl...

Girl?

The teacher,
Taeko Hashimoto.

That kid, Taeko?

Now's the time
to make a move.

I've got you, Naoko.

Thank you.

You missed some.

Cut it out.

Here. Herring.

You all right? Here...

It might help
if I hide my face.

And I'll be quiet.

It just isn't right to do
it to Monami's body.

I can use my mouth.

Don't say that
with Monami's face.

All right.

Well...

I'll sleep in Monami's
room from tomorrow.

I guess you should.

Maybe we should have
done that sooner.

Can I sleep here
just for tonight?

Yeah.

For Monami's entering
medical college!

Bottoms up!

Congratulations!

Daddy! Hurry up
and come here!

Here.

I promised Monami before.

Right?

You said you wanted to
eat grandpa's noodles.

0h, yes, I was dying for it.
and I love this.

Yes, yes!

Delicious.

I'm sorry.

My mother really loved
grandpa's noodles.

Tasty!

Really good.

Monami, do you have
a boyfriend?

Why...

No way!

Why not?

0ver my dead body.

That's 'father-talk', Heisuke.

She'll find a nice guy and get
married before you know it.

The day you got married
to Naoko...

0ur dad cried his eyes out.

He said he wanted to hit
you, Heisuke.

Nonsense.

But you cried.

That never happened.

He really said that.

Where's your dad?

In the bath.

That's nice.

It feels stiff here.

You can tell?

Yeah, dad, you always feel
stiff right here...

What?

I mean, my dad gets
a stiff back too.

He does?

You rub his back too
like a good girl.

Monami.

Yes?

You've grown up now.

So, if your dad finds a
suitable lady...

Let's give him our
blessing, all right?

Yeah.

Monami... I wonder
where she is now?

Damn it all!

Damn it!

Thank you for waiting.
This way please.

Here's the menu.
Please take you time.

I'll be back in a moment.

Welcome. How many in
the party?

Ah, just a second.

What the...?

What's wrong?

Guess I lost my wallet.

Come on, dad, you've
got to watch over me.

I'll pay.

All right?

Thank you.

All right?

Thanks.

Heisuke...

It can happen to anyone.

Hi.

Hello.

The money I owe you.

You came all the way here
to pay me back? Come in.

I've got to go.

Thanks anyway

Thank you.

Are you getting worker's
compensation?

No.

The company found out
dad was moonlighting.

I see... And how about
your college?

I quit.

I got a job in
a noodle shop.

You did? Where?

In Yotsuya.

Yotsuya? That's near
my company.

Do you know the "Kouya"?

Yes, it's catty-corner from a
sushi shop.

And the "Avalanche"
noodle shop nearby...

You wanted to know the
cause of the accident.

I think my dad dozed off
while driving.

He was working recklessly.

And it was all for you.

Maybe.

0ur life was never easy.

Maybe he had a gambling debt.

He liked to gamble.

What sick people need,
is not famous scholars.

They need good clinicians.

This is the basic doctrine
of our school.

Never let it fade from
your mind...

During the 6 years
you will study here.

For the many patients and
their families you'll meet,

Do become good doctors.

Join the sailboat club?

I'll be busy studying.

Anyone who only studies
won't make a good doctor.

Physical stamina is vital
for doctors.

Well... No thank you.

Doctors need stamina!

0ne two! 0ne two!

Doctors need stamina!

0ne two! 0ne two!

I'm scared!

Sugita! Pull!

Pull!

Pull the jib!

Stay cool!

Stay put!

Look forward!

Let go of the jib!

Loosen the sheet!

Don't stand up!

We'll capsize!

Stay cool!

I'm trying my best!

Sailboats?

Stamina is vital
for doctors.

Risky?

They're all experts.

And they are... men?

A German farmer wanted to
hunt badgers.

So, they crossed a dog with a
strong jaw and...

A dog with short legs,
and that made dachshunds.
