Replicants

are bioengineered humans,design by Tyrell corporation for use off-world.Their enhanced strength made them ideal slave labor

After a serious of violent rebellions,their manufacture became prohibited and Tyrell corp went bankrupt

The collapse of ecosystems in the mid 2020s
led to the rise of industrialist Niander Wallace.

Whose mastery of synthetic
farming averted famine

Wallace acquired the remains of Tyrell corp
and created a new line of replicants who obey.

many older model replicants-NEXUS 8s. with open-ended
lifespans-Survived.They are hunted down and "Retired"

those that hunt
them still go by the name...

Why are you following me?

Do I smell it?

I grow up by myself.

Garlic.
I see.

Just taste it.

No thanks.

How long have

Your bags.

Military equipment.

Where were you?
Callantha?

Certainly brutal.

Why dont you take me in?

And...

take a look inside?

Mr. Morton,

if it is...

it is a better option.

Someone, however,
would come in time.

I got to the point.

Whatever.

Now...

Could you

look up to the left.

Do not rise.

How do you feel
like killing yourself?

I do not delete my own
because we do not escape.

Fault of old models.

And the new designs
clean the shit out.

Because you have
not seen a miracle.

VOICE MESSAGE

<i>We got a lead on excavation.</i>

<i>Come here.</i>

<i>Carbon value 14.6 GPH.</i>

The box is from the
army to Sapper Morton.

It has been
creatively used as an urge.

Only bones and hair.

The samples show that the
woman had been buried for 30 years.

The skeleton has been dismantled, the bones are
cleansed and the entire care is carefully buried.

Woman?

The cause of death, Coco?

No fractures, no injuries except...

Innominate.

The baby got stuck in
the narrow breeding channel.

Was she pregnant?

Mm-hmm.

So he was not killed?

She died for her childbirth.

What is that?

Back.

Getting closer.

Yet.

That.

Duh.

Tracks in the
bowel of the bowel.

A thin knife, like a scalpel.

Looks like an emergency section.

The cuts are clean,
not defense damage.

He was a doctor.

Maybe saving was a business.

He did not look like a rescue guy.

He saw the trouble
of burying a woman.

Sensitive skirt.

Sorry.

Where is the child?

Did you look at the whole area?

Only land and
worms, no other corpses.

Maybe he was hungry.

Out.

He was a replicant.

Pregnant.

The world is on a wall that
separates half of each other.

Without the wall begins war.

Or slaughter.

So what you saw,

did not happen.

Yes ma'am.

My job is to maintain order.

We maintain order.

Delete this?

Delete all.

Baby?
I tracked it.

Was there anything else?

I have not deleted the birth.

So what?

The born ones have a soul.

Do you refuse?

I did not know I could, ma'am.

There you go.

Hey.

You did it without me.

Without what, ma'am.

The soul.

<i>And the new
designs clean the shit out.</i>

<i>Because you have
not seen a miracle.</i>

Wallace Headquarters

I'm checking
the old serial number.

DNA verification?

Hair.

Oops.

Old.

Parent older.

It will be difficult.

And so little is left,
what is left is...

clumped.

Customize your mind.

As human as you want.

But since it is a drilling site,

I would not waste your money
on intelligence, affection or charm.

Gun models are a matter of fact.

Will we go on later.

Everyone remembers
where they were at the break.

Just before the time.

I was at home with my parents.
And then ten days of darkness.

The machines went to the place.

When the lights came on,
the memories were empty.

Images, files that bit out.

We did not send bank squares.

It feels so good that there is only paper.

Everything was on
record, just about everything.

Mom still cries after baby pictures.

It's a pity it is.

Lose sweet pictures.

Time from shards, not much.

Last models before the ban.

Tyrell's standard set.

And?

Ordinary.
Ordinary?

There may be more.

The old serial
number returns home.

30 year old thing managed.

Thank you, Constable.

I'm Mr. Wallace's representative Luv.

She gave me the name.

Really.

I represent Wallace. This way.

The old models spoiled
the company's reputation.

What a gift Mr. Wallace to the world.

He rescued the foreign lands
when he bought Tyrell.

Beware of technology.

And that is not
what we have yet.

You are also a customer.
Are you satisfied?

Very realistic. Thank you.

The trash are preserved here.

For your luck, Mr Wallace
is a computer program.

No one has ever been here.

I apologize.

All our memories of that time
were destroyed in a break.

But there are snippets.

<i>Your son collects butterflies.
He'll show you his collection</i>

<i>as well as the slaughter.
I took the doctor.</i>

<i>... with your wasp hand.</i>

<i>I would kill him.</i>

<i>You can find a nudity picture
of a girl's full page in a magazine.</i>

<i>Is this a replicating or
lesbian test, Mr Deckard?</i>

<i>Please reply only.</i>

He was not sure about him.

Or someone was not there.

It was difficult to identify us then.

Is anything special about her?

You started a formal investigation.

Old serial numbers
are aroused by feelings.

Everyone sleeps better
when they are aware of them.

The woman likes her.

Who?

This is Constable Deckard.

He is trying to irritate.

Personal questions stimulate.

Get to know...

do not want to.

Do you keep your job, constable?

I thank Mr Wallace for your time.

You knew Constable Deckard.

What can you tell him about?

Lonely wolf.

Like me.

Together, we were acting alone.

That's it.

Can you tell me anything else?

She was not meant to be here.

Why not?

Something in his eyes.

Could he contact him?

No.

She is <i> retired </i>.

Retired.

What happened?

I guess I want it.

Be alone.

Welcome back, Mr Wallace.

Are you looking for a
new model to be delivered?

An angel should not come
to the Kingdom of Heaven

without a gift.

Can you even say "Child is born"?

New model...

We'll see.

First

feared

from the clay front.

Think.

Before we even
know who we are,

we are afraid to lose it.

Happy Birthday.

Let's see you now.

We make angels

for humanity.

There were bad
angels, but I do good.

And I took us
to nine new worlds.

The nine...

The child can count
nine with their fingers.

The stars should be ours!

Yes, Mr Wallace.

Humanity has come up
with a sacrificial labor force.

There is no return to Orjs,
except for biotechnology.

But production has its limits.

Karu pasture.

Empty and dry.

This here.

Emptiness on the road to the stars.

Does this have to
change for heaven's sake?

They do not add,

no matter how I tried.

We need more than we can do.

Millions and millions of millions.

Let's get Green back.

Tyrell's last trick.

Increase.

Lost perfection.

But the child is born.

Bring it to me.

Okay, Mr Wallace.

Best angel.

Are not you, Luv?

The green-eyed
man who killed Sapper.

Find out what he knows.

Hey.

Come on, hi, android boy.

Are you alone?

The guy is Blade Runner.

Let it be.

Let's go, it's fucking dangerous.
No worries.

No worries.

Do you buy me a cigarette?

You will not even smile.

Did not you listen to your friends?

Do not you know what I am?

I know.

Rice eating rape.

What is that?

Wood.

Oh.

I have not seen the wood.

It's pretty.

It's dead.

Who holds dead wood?

You do not mind me?

I can kill. What model do you have?

Take your eye.

The right girls
are not interested.

Well, you can find me here.

Hey.

You can not take them.

I understand. I have papers.

Keep this.

Yes, here.

Coco is dead.

Bones are gone.

The information has already
leaked out. How long did it go?

What you have?
And do not say "nothing".

I found that.

Sock?

Where was it found?
From Sapper's farm.

Anything else?

I burned everything else.

What is this date?
Birth or Death Day?

I do not know yet.

Does not anyone else
see where this leads to?

This is breaking the world, K.

I have known many like you.

Useful but...

for you I forget sometimes.

You were not
there when I was a kid.

Do you remember anything?

Before you came to the house.

I have memories, but...

They are not real, but transitions.

Tell one of your childhood.

It feels a little strange to tell
about the childhood I did not live.

Will I help if I tell you?

I remember a toy, a puppy.

Engraving.

I just remember that the boy
was trying to take it away from me.

I ran away.

I'm looking for a hideout,
and it's just a dark oven.

It's really dark and scary, but...

the horse is all out, so I go in.

They will find and try to hack
me to tell, but I will not tell you.

That's it.

Little K defends his own.

Good memory.

Look here.

We are all looking
for something right.

What happens if I
run the whole bottle?

Should I go back to work, ma'am?

You did not want to fuck?

You listened.

There is nothing to tell.

have you told me?

Your memories.

Coincidence?

A dangerous coincidence.

I always knew you were special.

Maybe this is the specialty.

I do not need any...

Because I have all kinds.

No no no...
I do not buy.

I am an honest player.

Listen...

You even bigger...

Even bigger players
tried to stop me...

and they were...

hard players.

I'm looking for a boy for 30 years.

I need your accounting.

Investments, sales, all.

So the old ones
are not in the books.

Is not it?
No, no.

Sorry. I can not help.

Are not you?
No.

Yes you can.

You have a good memory.

Tell me what to remember,
or shoot the hole and look at myself.

They laughed at you...

Are you coming?

Where is it?

Oh God.

Where, where, where?

I can not find it.

It's gone.

The whole year is torn.

I did not do it.

It was not me.

I do not...

I did not.

I always said
that you are special.

Born, not made.

Hidden with care.

Right boy.

The real boy needs the right name.

Joe.

"Joe"?

You are too important for K.

Your mother would have named you.

Joe.

Joe.

Do not.

How do I know if
memory is a move or not?

Who does the memories do?

Dr. Ana Stelline?

Guest.

Is that okay?

Suitable for.

Unusual only.

Fun to meet, Constable KD6-3.7.

Sorry.

Immune Deficiency.

Freedom behind the glass.

Why did not you stay here?

So.

I would have gone with
my parents, but I got sick.

So...

my life changed.

They put me in my cup

filling it with what they
can to keep me happy

except with the club of course.

I was used to people.

How can I help?

I thought you
could help the story.

The most interesting offer at a time.

Do you think I'm
working at the same time?

Of course.

I promise to hear every word.

You are considered to be the
best memory in the country.

Kindness.

I love birthday parties.

Do you work for Wallace?

I am one of his subcontractors.

He made a bid, but I
stay an entrepreneur.

What Makes You So Good?

What makes your
memories so authentic?

Well, there is always
something in your work.

But I've been here
eight years old.

To see the world it
was supposed to imagine.

I came to see
you as an imaginator.

Wallace needs me to
be a functional product.

I'm doing it for kindness.

Replicants are hard.

For jobs that people would not do.

I can not change your destiny,
but my memory brings a smile.

Strongly done.

Kivemmin. They seem authentic.

And the real memories are...

genuine feelings.

Is not that right?

Are all made, or is it true?

Using the right memories
is illegal, constable.

How do they
differentiate between them?

Can you identify...

realistic?

It is believed that it is in detail.

But memory does
not work that way.

We remember our feelings.

It's a mess.

I can show you.

Sit down.

Think of the memory
you want to look like.

Just imagine.

Freely.

Someone says this.

This happened.

It is true.

It is true.

Goddamn it!

I emphasized the importance,

According to the control,
you have something else.

Far from the benchmark.

Do you know what it means?

I found the child.

He had been made a

She did not know who she was.

Yeah?
It's done.

It's done.

You just got a bomb.

I can not do it.

So what?

I just have questions.

What are the questions?

Place.

Listen, I do not want to hurt you.

But you make it difficult.

I do not know.

Ask about it.

Do you have a name?

Constable KD6-3.7.

It's not the name
but the serial number.

Alright.

Joe.

What do you want, Joe?

Ask questions.

Like what?

What was his name?

Your mother's mother.

What was he like?

Were you here together?

Too many questions.

I was you and good at it.

Easier times.

Why are you
making them difficult?

Why not answer the question?

Which question?

I did not believe
you would grind shit.

What was his name?

Rachael.

His name was Rachael.

What happened to the baby?

Did you send him orphanage?

I had left the times then.

You did not even meet your child?

Why do not you?

I remain in the plan.

I showed you how to mess
up information, covering traces.

My role was to leave.

The crash covered
the trails forever.

I would not have found her.

Did you want to?

Not really.

Why do not you?

We were hunted.

I did not want our
children to be found.

Cut to pieces.

Sometimes about love

must be a stranger.

The stranger.

What did you do?

Who did you bring?

No one.

Really?

<i>Item locked.</i>

You are known.

I came alone.

Poor dog.

Do not!

I really hope you're happy.

I love you--

Hey.

Someone wants to meet you.

You can count on us.

You want me to look up to the left.

This is Frey.

He was with Kalashniki in Saphir.

I recognize you.

Did you help hide the child?

I was there.

I saw a miracle birth.

The full faces weeped me.

Smell like a thunder.

Were you with her?

Rachael.

He died in my arms.

We hid the baby

and we vowed
to keep our secrets.

That's why Sapper killed himself.

The child made us
more than slaves.

If a child can become of us,

we are our own cronies.

"More humane than humans".

It is the time of the revolution.

We build an army.

I want to release us.

If you want to be free, join us.

Deckard, Sapper, you, me.

Our lives do not mean anything
near the approaching storm.

Death for the right thing is the
most human thing we can do.

You led to Wallace Deckard.

You can not let Deckard
guide Wallace to me.

You have to kill Deckard.

Deckard just wanted
his baby to be safe.

The child is safe.

When time comes, I'll
show the girl to the world.

He will lead our army.

A girl?

Of course.

Rachael got a daughter.

That's how he
comes with my own eyes.

I got him blue when
the departure came.

You hid the boy.

Only a piece of puzzle piece.

Did you think it was you?

You thought.

You thought.

We all liked it as well.

That's why we believe.

<i>Someone says this.</i>

<i>I showed you how to mess
up information, covering traces.</i>

<i>That's how he
comes with my own eyes.</i>

<i>I got him blue when
the departure came.</i>

<i>There is always
something in your job.</i>

That jumps always.

Without thinking of what
you would do on the ground.

Courage can not
change the truth.

I've been wanting
to meet you for so long.

You are a miracle
to me, Mr Deckard.

I had a lock.

I found the key.

But the pins are not in line

and the door stays locked.

I need a sample piece, Mr Deckard.

That child.

I need her baby.

I'm teaching everything to fly.

"God remembered Rachel,

he heard her

and opened her womb. "

<i>Do you hold our owls?</i>

<i>Is it artificial?</i>

<i>Of course it is.</i>

<i>It's probably expensive.</i>

<i>Very.</i>

<i>I'm Rachael.</i>

<i>Deckard.</i>

Is the feeling the same

now than then

when did you meet?

All these years of the
perfection of the memory drilled.

How shiny his lips.

Your immediate contact.

Did you mind that
you were just called?

Planned to fall in love right then.

Make a perfect model.

So if planned.

Love

or mathematical punctuality.

Which

or the camp?

I know what's true.

It was a shame
to keep yourself out.

And it did not
pay like anything.

But you can still help.

You got help hiding.

Where did they go?

I know you know something.

Help me...

and good things can happen.

You have no children.

Is it?

Millions.

Do you think I
can only offer pain?

But I know.

You love the pain.

It reminds you of your happiness.

More luck then.

Do not be afraid.

Angel.

Re-created.

To you.

Did you miss me?

Do not you love me?

His eyes were green.

In the outside world

let me talk to you.

You do not feel the pain yet.

But you learn.

<i>Hello handsome.</i>

<i>What day, huh?</i>

<i>Orpo expression.</i>

<i>I can fix it.</i>

<i>You look good at the river.</i>

JOI - ALL YOU WANT
TO BE BEING AND VIEW

<i>Death for the right thing is the
most human thing we can do.</i>

<i>Because you have
not seen a miracle.</i>

<i>Get to the airspace of
Los Angeles Airport.</i>

<i>Tunnistautukaa.</i>

Transportation S-14-4-XD.

Where are we going?

Home.

<i>Engine 2 inoperative.
The spare motor is connected.</i>

<i>Warning.</i>

Does it work?
Too low!

Get back!

Up.

Open the door.

I am the best.

The outside world is waiting.

Joe.

Joe!

Joe!

You would have let me die.

Annoinkin.

You fucked.

You can meet your daughter now.

The best memories are her.

Why?

Who am I to you?

Meet your daughter.

Are you okay?

Just a moment.

Is not it beautiful?
