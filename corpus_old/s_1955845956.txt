The deal was 25.

No. The deal was 3.
No, deal was for 25.

The deal was 3.
Wanna call Uncle?

Have him tell you?
No, Uncle knows the deal.

You call him. Hey!
Hey, you little shit...


You better be easy
with that.

I started easy.

Now...

you owe another 5.

Go in the refrigerator.

There's a stack of cash
in there.

There's a $1000.

You can take the 5.

No, I said
you could take 5.

You lied.
Oh, okay.

Okay, don't even worry about it,
little man.

<i>â™ª Sittin' here

Stop talking. Shut up.

You're making my head hurt.

You're late. Get in here.
Sit down.

Because that is your job.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Shut the door.

Shut the door!

[DOOR CLOSES]

What the...?

What is this?
You have crumbs on your shirt.

I didn't give you cash
for food.

That means you take
from bag.

Look at me.

Look at me.

You want I cut the tip
of your finger off for stealing?

Is that what you want?

Give it to me.

Give it.

The pastry was 3.

[CLEARS THROAT]

I used 20
and put the rest back.

I got an extra 500
from the mark.

You what?

He tried to short us 5,
so I handled it.

Still doesn't mean
you get to steal from me.

Come on, Danny.
W-we feed you here.

You don't go starving.

Your second time.

It's the second time
you steal from me.

Hm?

I was hungry.


Next time you steal from me,

I cut your hand off.
I put it in frigerator.

For that, I send you
back out now. Get up.

[BREATHING SHAKILY]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

<i>â™ª 'Cause I'm just a soul â™ª</i>

Hey! Asshole!

Hey.

<i>â™ª Baby, you understand
Me now â™ª</i>

MARY:
Back from the dead, huh?

[FOOD SIZZLES,
SPATULA SCRAPES]

Where am I?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

You're safe.

You're in my apartment.

And who the hell are you?

I'm Mary.

You were hurt.
Passed out in an alley.

Come on. Eat.

Where's my bag?

You'll get it back.

Everything inside it too.
I need it now.

Sit down.

I need to get back.

Back where?

I'm supposed to go
to Back Bay.

I tell you what.

You sit down,
have some food,

I'll take you to Back Bay
myself. How's that?

[MARY POURS DRINK]

Whoa, slow down.

When's the last time
you ate?

So what's in Back Bay?

Your mother.

What, you got family
or friends there?

What's with all
the questions, lady?

You a cop?

Not exactly.

I'm just trying to help.
That's all.

Yeah? I don't need
your help.

See, I think you do,

knowing what's in that
backpack of yours.

Let me guess:
two bricks of brown...

and a semiautomatic handgun?

Hm?

The man who gave you that bag,
what's his name?

He'll kill me
for talking to you.

He won't lay
a finger on you.

He'll kill us both.

You know what happens...

if you get busted
with that bag?

Hm?

The cops will turn you
into an informant.

Yeah?

Well, I ain't
no snitch, so...

Yeah, well,
that doesn't matter.

All that matters
is what people think.

And nobody likes talking to kids
who talks to cops. Right?

Especially where
we come from.

Look, I'm on your side.

Come on, let's
clean up that cut.

[GROANS SOFTLY]

You got blood
all over your shirt.

Stay right here.

Here you go.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[MARY SIGHS]

Who did that to you?

Uncle?

How you know Uncle?
Don't worry about that.

Did he do that to you?

Where you going?

To teach somebody
some manners.

Shit. I'm coming with you.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

What are you about to do?

You just stay in the car.

Keep the doors locked. Okay?

Put your hood on.


What can I do for you?

It's all there.
He didn't touch a thing.

A bit out of the way
for you, isn't it?

I thought I'd, um,
return it.

We don't want
any hard feelings.

No hard feelings?
Yeah.


You think because you're
Benny goddamn Spencer's girl

you get to walk in here
and shoot your mouth off

like a parrot with tits?

[MEN CHUCKLE]

Okay, all right.
Now you're just being rude.

Danny belongs to me.

Danny belongs to no one.

It's all right. You know,
I-I like your style.

No hard feelings, hm?

Why don't you go get
the little thief?

Bring him up here.

And then in a few years,

if I don't want him
anymore...

and if he's still alive,
maybe I sell him to you.

I think you mean
if you're still alive.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

MAN:
Uncle?


What did you do?

I just fucked up.

Bad.

[ENGINE STARTS]

[SPORTSCASTER DRONING
INDISTINCTLY ON TV]

You sleeping on the sofa, okay?
You should be comfortable.

[CELL PHONE VIBRATES]

Uh...

I gotta run out for a bit.

You just gonna leave me
in your house?

Yeah. Why not?
I could rob you.

Yeah, but you're not.
Make yourself at home.

Get whatever you want out
of the fridge.

You know where the bathroom is,
it takes a minute

for the hot water to come up.
One rule:

Stay out of my room.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]

[DOOR HANDLE CLICKS]

[WINDOW ROLLS DOWN]

You can't check in?


My phone died.

Someone took out Uncle
and his crew.

Kozlovs think it was us.

Where's Benny?

His office.

I'll be up.

Ah.

The Kozlovs think we did this
to take Uncle's territory.

That's ridiculous.
Of course it is.

Whoever killed that douche bag
did the world a favor.

Who did it?
WALTER: Asshole like him...

everyone's a suspect.
Okay, Walter.

We gotta make a move
before they retaliate.

Last thing we want
is another war.

Maybe that's exactly
what we need is war.

Maybe he's right, Pop.

Mary?

Mary.

You've been so quiet.

Oh...

I was just thinking.

You're right.

We don't need another war.

We need to put this
to bed now.

Tom.

Arrange a meeting
for tomorrow.

You got it, Pop.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]


[TEA KETTLE WHISTLING]

You went through my things
last night.

I thought I told you
to stay out of my room.

Oh, you think
that's funny?

No.

Why you got guns
in your room?

You didn't see any guns.
Do you understand me?

I said,
do you understand me?

Yeah, I got it.


The next time I tell you
to do something,

you better listen.

We understand each other?

I got it.

Because I gotta leave,
but I'll be back.

Stay in this apartment.
Lock the door.

Do not answer it
under any circumstance.

Do you understand me?

Yeah, whatever, man.

Don't "whatever" me.

What are you gonna do, huh?

If you gonna hit me,
just do it.

Sorry.

Sorry.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[CROWS CAWING]

Please spare me
your sympathy.

Take this. Here.

Uncle was my father's
youngest brother.

Not his brightest
and not my favorite...

but he was family.

What we want is justice.

We're here to avoid
any misunderstanding.

Tell me, how do we know
it wasn't

the pervert Walter King?

He and Uncle
always had bad blood.

Whoever killed Uncle
was not sanctioned by me.

But if they work for me,
I can assure you

they will be dealt with
immediately.

You've always been
a smart man.

But what you asking me
to do, Benny?

Forgive and forget?

He's telling you, be careful
where you point your fingers.

Anyone could have done this,
but if it's one of my people...

you have my word.

I appreciate that.

And now there's something else
I would like to discuss.

The West End.
What about it?

Give it to us.

Are you out
of your goddamn mind?

In the matter of reparation.
I didn't come here

to renegotiate
territories.

But I will definitely
give this matter

serious consideration.

You do that, Benny.

I promise you, Luka.
Good.


Thank you, Benny.

[ENGINE STARTS]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

So they think they're gonna use
that bullshit as leverage

to reallocate territory?
No way.

We need to find out
who the hell started this mess

by wasting Uncle.
Walter.

Luka said Uncle
and Walter had bad blood.

Uncle called him a perv.

He said Walter abused
one of his boys.

We need to find out
who started this

and take that
son of a bitch out.

No. No, we just need
to throw him a bone.

That's bullshit.

We need to send
the right message.

Just give him Walter.

He targeted Uncle before.
Luka said so.

That was a long time ago, Mary.

Come on, man, grudges don't die.
You know that.

He hates him. You heard him.

If anybody wanted Uncle dead,
it would be Walter.

She's not wrong.

Walter would be
the only one arrogant enough

to make a move
without my blessing.

Mary. And you will do this?

TOM:
He jogs every day at 3 p.m.

Like clockwork.

Done.

So be it.

I'll sell it to Luka.

[DUCKS QUACK]

Hey.

You okay?

What you mean about Uncle?

What about him?

You said I ain't have to worry
about him no more.

You don't.

No one does.

Oh, shit.

Badass.
Hey.

What the hell are you, lady?

Some kind of...?
Your mouth.

Look, I told you
I wasn't gonna let

anybody touch you,
and I meant it.

So you do all that
for me, huh?

Damn sure
didn't do it for myself.

Well, thanks.

That's dope.

But you know
he got friends.

They could be looking
for me right now.

Here.

So, lady...
Mary.

Please. Thank you.

Fine. Mary.

Why do you got all them guns
in your room?

The ones I didn't see.

Business.
What kind of business?

Security, okay?

"Security" like protection?

Yep.
Protection for who?

That's none of your business.

Why you got all that cash
in your room?

Look, not your business again.
Do you like hot dogs, fat mouth?

No, shit.
Who don't like hot dogs?

Watch your... Ah-ah!
I'm hungry as a...

I got a lot of work
to do with you.

I'm playing with you,
you know?

You need to be careful
with how you play with adults

because I don't play.

Is that right?
Yeah, that's right.

Better be glad
you like hot dogs.

I don't trust people
who don't like a good dog.

How you like yours?

I don't know. Ketchup?

Ketchup? That's all?

I'd like mine
with the works, please.

What's "the works"?
Everything.

Two with the works.
Two?

What you gonna eat?

You better make that four.

Yeah, I could eat these
all day long.

I don't even want
to know what's in 'em.


How about we, um, sit
on that bench over there.

Knock these puppies out.

Mm. Got a better idea.

[SEAGULLS CAWING]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

This is where I come
to escape.

Pretty cool, huh?

Beyond cool.

Yeah.

DANNY:
Before she left us...

my mom used to
take me here.

We used to sit out
on the water.

Big sack lunches.

Feed the seagulls.

My father was killed.

A year ago.

After that, I went to go stay
with my grandma till she died.

And then what?

They wanted to send me
to some home for boys.

Who?

Those assholes
at Child Services.

I ran.

Lived in the parks
for some time.

Then one of Uncle's boys
found me.

I guess
you know the rest.


Finish your hot dog.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[BALL BOUNCING DISTANTLY]

Hey. Listen up.

I gotta talk to you
for a second. Look.

Listen, long as
you're here,

keep that door locked,

and don't you open it.
Don't go anywhere.

You being here
is our secret, right?

Yeah, yeah.
No, no, no, look at me.

No "yeah, yeah."

This is serious. Okay?

I got it.

"I got it."
Let me see that ball.

Stop bouncing it
on my wall.

[BOTH LAUGH]

MARY:
I'll be back.

MARY:
What did I say?

You want me
to come back over there?

It could've been
you or me, Pop.

I keep telling you
there's only one thing

these animals understand,
and that's an eye for an eye.

I say we hit the Kozlovs
back hard now.

Slow...

down.

We're not starting a war

until we're absolutely
sure it was them.

You wouldn't have said that
20 years ago.

What are you
trying to say?

I'm not trying
to say anything.

If you can't handle it,
I will.

What are you doing here?
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

Looking for Mary.
She's not answering her phone.

You live around here?

Yeah. Jamaica Plain.

So how you know Mary?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Let's try this again.

How you know Mary?

From around.

How you know Mary?
We work together.

In security business?

Security business.

That's a good one.

As soon as she gets home,
you tell her to call me.

It's very important.

You understand that?

Okay.

Give her the message.

[DOOR OPENS]

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Danny?


I told you not to go

in my goddamn room.
You lied to me.

I lied to you?

Yeah. What, you think
I'm stupid?

I told you not to go
through my things, Danny.

Your friend came over.
Nice guy.

Tom? And you let him in?

He had a key.
[LAUGHS]

Is that your boyfriend?
Not anymore.

Yeah, but he was.

Look, it's complicated, kid.

Complicated how?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Let's just say,
Tom is now like a brother to me.

Yeah, but he wasn't always.
No, Oprah, he wasn't.

What the hell
was he doing in here?

I don't know.
Well, what did he say?

He said you're not in security.
That's for damn sure.

Yeah, well, Tom is an asshole.
Duh.

What else did he say?

He said he wanted you
to call him.

It was important.
It was urgent.

He was pretty pissed.

Lady.

What is it that
you really do?

I'm a nun.
I'm a goddamn nun.

What's it to you,
you nosy, little shit?

Okay, you know what?
You want me to leave? I'll go!

Okay, fine.
There's the door. Go.

Is that what you want?

Did I say that's what I want?
Did I?

[DANNY SNIFFS]


MARY:
Look.

You don't have to worry
about Tom, okay?

This is about you and me.

This is about us.

You understand?

Yeah.

Good.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

You kept your key?

Why can't I reach you no more?
Called you, no answer.

Texted you, no answer.
Radio silence. Not a call.

What's so goddamn important
you had to barge into...?

Kozlovs tried to hit Pop.
That's what's important.

After we gave them Walter?
No, they hit him before.

They don't give a shit about
Walter. They're trying to use it

as an opportunity
to take out Benny.

How do you know?

Come on.



Look at me.

No.





TOM:
I'm not asking you again.

[SCREAMING, CRYING]

[SCREAMING CONTINUES,

BENNY: Do you know how long
he's been in there with Tom?

Two hours.

You know
what he's told him?

Everything.

What's our next move?

Tom's new friend
volunteered

that Luka will
be hosting a meeting

for all the members
of the family this Friday.

I need you and Tom
to deliver a message.

I understand.

I hear you've
taken in a stray.

Yeah, it's no big deal.
I was gonna tell you.

And yet, you didn't.

So you're mad at me?

Should I be?

He was hurt.
He needed help.

He's only been with me
a couple days.

How old?
MARY: Twelve.

Or 13. I don't really know.

So bring him over
to the house for dinner.

It's Mina's birthday.

[DOOR COVERING FLAPS]

What's up?

We was just talking about
your mother's birthday party.

With everything going on,
we're having a party?

You want to tell her

that her 65th birthday party's
been canceled?

TOM: No.
Okay.

Hey.

Let's get this done.

[EASY-LISTENING MUSIC
PLAYING]

DANNY:
Why do I need a sport coat?

Can't even pronounce
half of this stuff.

Because you've been
invited somewhere...

DANNY: So?
...and a proper young man

wears a proper jacket.

Besides, we need to get you
a new sweatshirt.

What's wrong with
my hoodie?

When is the last time
you washed it?

Washed?
Exactly. Come here.

Give it here.

Thank you very much.

Here.
We'll get a new...

Hey, watch the attitude.

And you gonna get
some new jeans too.

I like that hoodie.

This is nice.
Look at this.

Blue hoodie.
It's all right.

No?

EMPLOYEE: I think this
one suits you perfectly.

MARY: Oh, that is nice.
I hate it.

MARY: Uh, excuse me.

What the hell is that?
Come here. Come here.

It's called respect, all right?
Put the damn jacket on.

I don't wanna put the damn ja...
Watch your mouth.

EMPLOYEE: You look handsome.
Yes.

I look like a douche bag.

Ugh. Language.

Perhaps he'd be
more comfortable at...

No, we're good right here.
Oh, well.

So who's gonna be at this thing
you keep telling me about?

Family.

Well if it's family,
isn't a nice shirt good enough?

No, it's not.

Not for Benny.
Who's Benny?

Tom's father.

Oh, you mean Tom,
your boyfriend?

Oh, shut up.
He's not my boyfriend.

Mm-hm.
Anyway, Benny's Tom's father,

and he used to take care of me
when I was a kid.

Take care of you
like you take care of me?

Kinda.

Kinda how?


When I was a kid,
my father,

he wasn't nice
to me and my mom.

So when I got old enough to run,
I ran away.

And I was living
in the streets for a while.

Like me?

Yep, just like you.

[SCOFFS]
[CHUCKLES]

Oh, here she come again.

How's this?
MARY: Much better.

Try it on.

Here.
Try it on.

I don't wanna try it on.
Come on, now. Move.

I wanna get out of
this bougie-ass...

Watch your mouth.

Blue is classy.

Yes, look at you.
See, you like it.

Change is good.
Come on.

MARY: <i>Remember what I told
you about Benny, right?</i>

<i>If he starts asking questions?</i>

Don't tell him who I worked for,
and don't tell him about Uncle.

MARY:
That's right.

Damn.

MARY:
Come here.

What's your last name?

Warren.
Danny Warren from?

Dorchester.
What street?

Norfolk Avenue.
Mm-hm.

What about your parents?

I never met them.

I was in a lot of foster homes,
but they didn't work out.

That's right.

Look.

I don't care how nice
Benny is to you.

He is not to be trusted.

He is not your friend.

Remember that.

Okay.

Now, let's go over this again.
What's your last name?

Danny Warren.
BENNY: Danny Warren, huh?

Where you from?
Dorchester.

One of my best friends
growing up was named Danny.

We called him "Danny Boy."

Anybody ever call you that?

Some people.

BENNY:
I wanna toast my wife.

To 45 more years of happiness.

Happy birthday, Mina.
Happy birthday, beautiful.

Thank you. Thank you.

[JAZZ SONG PLAYING FAINTLY]

Mm. Ooh.

Ooh, what do I hear? Shoot.
MINA: Oh, Jesus.

Oh, my God.
Uh-oh.

BENNY: You remember how
we used to dance to this?

Uh-oh! Benny move.

Good luck, girl.
Yes. I'm gonna need it.

<i>â™ª Ooh â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yes, I do, girl... â™ª</i>

You've seemed distracted.
What's on your mind?

Well, just...

Just something
I've been thinking about

the last couple of days.

What?
Well, I...

I'm just thinking
that it's time

for me to move on,
you know?

I just wanna do something else
with my life.

Look at me,
sweetheart.

Is this about Tom?

No, it's not about him.

It's about me.

Oh, okay, then.

Well this can wait
till tomorrow.

Because today
is about Mina.

Of course.
All right?

Mm-hm.
Okay.

MINA:
Well, I could never understand

how people could
just give up their children.

I better get back out
there to him.

MINA:
Hi, baby.

Mm. Red velvet.

MINA:
It's good.

Happy birthday, Mom.
Thank you.

TOM:
Yes, please.

Would you mind taking Danny
a slice, Mama?

Give me a sec with Mary?

MINA: Sure.
TOM: All right, thanks.

MARY:
Thank you.

You look
real beautiful tonight.

So what's
on your mind, Tom?

The kid.
What about him?

Cleans up real nice.
MARY: Mm-hm.

Danny Warren from Dorchester.
Yep.

He told me Jamaica Plain.
So I asked myself:

"Why would a kid
from Jamaica Plain

say he's
from Dorchester?"

What's your point?

Then I seemed to remember,
wasn't there a hit

on a bookie last year
from Jamaica Plain?

What was the last name?
I don't remember.

Miller.

Funny. I also remember
a news story

that mentioned a kid
that survived.

Don't make this about us.
You said there was no kid.

Yeah, because I don't do kids,
and you know that.

That's not the point.
It was for me.

Did he see you?
No.

Did you see him?
No.

Mary, is there any way
that kid can connect

this family to that hit?

No.
You better hope not.

Where'd you find him?
I'm not doing this tonight.

And I'm not doing it here.
Just leave the kid out of this.

How you think the old man
will react when he hears?

Maybe we should go over there
and tell him together.

I mean, you know
how he loves secrets.

We don't need
no more problems.

This thing with the kid,

it could turn out
to be very dangerous, Mary.

People find out who...
That's not gonna happen.

What if it's a gamble
the old man doesn't wanna take?

What if I go tell your father
you called him "the old man"?

Oh, Tom, what are you doing?
I'm trying to apologize.

I'm sorry.

Mm-hm.

I'm not gonna say
nothing about the kid

or his name to the old man.

I just want us back
the way we were.

Tom, I can't do this
with you, okay?

Come here, come here,
come here.

Tell me you didn't love me.

For s-so many years.

And that girl
never stopped loving you.

I'm just not that girl anymore.

What's that even mean?

It means I should
probably get Danny home.

You need to get some rest.

We have a big job tomorrow.

MARY:
Good morning.

You hungry?

Cereal.

He said I could come over
whenever I want.

MARY: Huh?
Benny.

What about him?

He said I could come over
whenever I want.

Danny, look, I, uh...

You know that money you found
in my closet? With the guns?

If something happens,

I want you to have it, okay?
It's yours.

Okay. What are you
talking about?

I just... I just want you
to be prepared, okay?

You know where we from.
If you stay ready,

you ain't gotta get ready,
right?

That money
is your freedom.

Okay?

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

I want you to take that money,
and I want you to run.

I want you to run
as fast as you can.

I want you to buy you
a real nice life.

Okay?

Promise me that.

Promise me.

I promise.

Okay.

Go ahead and eat.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[GUN CLICKS]

[CAR DOOR CLOSES]

Why didn't you tell me?

What?

Pop says you're talking
about getting out again.


Is it because of me?
No, it's not because of you.

So why didn't you tell me?
You're just gonna retire?

And then what?

Open up a bed-and-breakfast
with the kid?

This is not a life
you just choose to leave.

Mary, you know that.

The old man's not gonna let you
just walk out of here.

Besides, you know too much.
You'd be a liability.

He's telling you what
you wanna hear. Always has.

What is it you're pretending
not to understand?

Wake up.

No one leaves.

Stop.

I'm not your responsibility

We got them, Pop.

Where's Mary?
She took a hit, but...

She took a hit?
Yeah. She's fine.

Well, where the hell is she?

She didn't want help.

You mean she didn't want
your help.

Wasn't for me,
she'd be dead right now.

If it wasn't for you,
she'd be here.

I'm not losing her.

[MARY BREATHING HEAVILY]

MARY: Nothing.

Just a scrape.

It's fine, honey.

It's just a scratch,

Go back to bed. It's okay.

Go back to bed.

I just need to lay down

[EXHALES SHARPLY]

Mary. What you need?
Can I get you something?

Oh.
Ugh.

I just need to lay down
and close my eyes

for a couple of minutes, baby.
That's all.

When you're better,
we'll go, right?

We'll get out of here?

Go somewhere far away,
like you said?



Tom was right.

He ain't never
gonna let me go.

I tried.

Well try again.
That's bullshit, Mary.


I tried.

I'm here to see Benny.

Who the hell are you?

I'm Danny.

Friend of Mary's.
All right. Hold on, man.

[CELL PHONE KEYS CLICK]

Yeah.

I got this kid here
to see Benny.

Said he's a friend
of Mary's.

Name's Danny.

Yeah.
Tell him it's Danny Boy.

Danny Boy.

Yeah. Nah, he's alone.

All right.

Go ahead.

<i>[MAN VOCALIZING]</i>

Danny Boy.

Where's Mary?

I came alone.

How is she?
Tom says she was hurt.

She's gonna be fine.

That's good.

Something on your mind?

Um.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

BENNY:
Danny?

You gotta let her go.

Hm.

And I know Tom said
you're never gonna, but...

you gotta.

Danny, these
are family matters.

It's better you avoid getting
mixed up in something

you don't understand.
I understand fine.

Okay?

I mean,
I'm not, like,

stupid or-or nothing.

Well now that I know
you're not stupid or nothing,

this is what
you're gonna do.

You're gonna run back home,
and tell Mary

that I would like to see her.

And that if she's hurt,

we'll arrange for her to receive
proper medical treatment.

I don't think so.

Oh, you don't?

[GUN COCKS]

No.

I don't.

Huh.

She doesn't
work for you anymore.

You're a brave boy.

I see that.

But you're making a mistake.

I'm gonna tell you
a story, Danny.

Let's see. I guess
it was about a year ago.

I sent Mary on a contract
in Jamaica Plain.

This particular mark
was a bookie

who was in debt
for over $100,000.

Marcus Miller.

You're lying.

Mary didn't find you,
Danny Miller.

She was following you.

You're lying.
Really?

None of this sounds familiar?

I thought so.

You're upset.
It's understandable.

But put the gun down.

Now, you can put it
down on the floor,

or I can come
and take it from you.

[GUN COCKS]

It's okay. I understand.

I love Mary too.
We all love Mary.

But she's not
who you think she is.

She's only
looking after you

because she feels guilty.

And why shouldn't she?

She made you an orphan.


Hey.

Everything is gonna...
MARY: Let him go.

Go get in the car.

Go!

[DOOR CLOSES]

Tom says you were hurt.

You don't look well.

Put the gun down.

Danny and I
are getting out of here.

So I see.

Yeah, my debt
to you is paid.

Your debt?

I took care of you.
Gave you a family.

Was like a father to you.
Is that what you tell yourself?

I taught you to survive.

Yeah, well, it's time for me
to move on now.


Mary, baby.

You're acting crazy.
Stop it.

You know how much
I love you.

Well, if you love me,

Benny, let me go.

Please let me go.

No.

You ungrateful bitch.

Debt?

You don't owe me a debt.

I own you.

And you're not going anywhere.

You're gonna stay in the family
and work for me.

And you will train Danny
to work for the family,

just like I trained you.

If you leave,

we will find you and the boy.

So you see?

You're not going anywhere.

Now...

look at me,

and tell me
that you understand.

Mary.

I need you to look at me,

and tell me you understand.

I understand.



[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

[MAN YELLS, BODY THUDS]

[CAR ENGINE REVVING,
TIRES SQUEALING]

Of course.

Where is he?
Upstairs in his office, Tom.

Cops know yet?
No, not yet.

Shut this place down.
No calls in or out.

Nobody talks to nobody.
You got it, Tom.


Give me a second.
MAN: Everybody out.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

Tom.
Not now.

Sorry, boss, but I think
you're gonna wanna hear this.

Jerome.

Get in here.

Tell him what you saw.

A kid.
What kid?

One of Uncle's boys.

I was outside, unloading
the last of the containers,

and I seen this kid come
into the warehouse.

He talked
to Rick and Maurice.

Maurice made a call,
and let him come upstairs.

And?

About 10 minutes later,
I'm inside,

and all of a sudden
I see this kid

come running down the stairs
like the place was on fire.

You sure?

JEROME:
Yeah.

Pulled a gun on me once.

And he was alone?

JEROME: Yeah, as far
as I could tell.

[SIGHS]
OMAR: Yeah, okay.

[SEAGULLS CAWING]

Hey.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

So it's true what
Benny said?

About my father.

Danny...

there's not a moment

of my life that I don't regret
that hit on your father.

Mom left that son of a bitch
when I was 7.


The only thing she forgot
to take was me.

She forgot to take me.


But he said you're only
taking care of me out of guilt.

No, that's not true.

All right,
maybe it was at first.

But it's not now.

You lied to me.

I mean, you don't c...
you don't care about me.

I do.
No, you don't.

Danny, I do.
I care about you, okay?

That's why I found you.

How?

How'd you find me?

A photo from your house

from that day.

I saw you too.


So I asked around,

and eventually, I found out
you were one of Uncle's boys.

[BREATHS SHAKILY]

So I started watching you.

I didn't know how I was
gonna approach you, so...

that day,
when I saw you in the...

In the alley, hurt...


I can understand
if you hate me, Danny.

[SNIFFS, LAUGHS]

I can understand
if you want me dead.

But they're gonna
come after you.

[CELL PHONE VIBRATES]

They're gonna come
after you.

You gotta
let me fix this, okay?

We gotta go. Come on.

[â™ªâ™ªâ™ª]

What I'm having
a hard time believing

is you walked in here,

and killed him alone.

TOM:
Look at me!

I didn't kill your old man.

You asshole.
TOM: Yeah.

I was afraid of that.

Take him upstairs.

Make sure he stays there.
