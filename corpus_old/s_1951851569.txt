abuses.
How could we not know?

We have been told ofthe
indignities.
How could we not hear?

Six dollar salaries;

our men carrying
their own machines to work,

cheated on piecework;

our girls given
$4 and $3 a week...

because they
are called "learners, "

when all there is for them to
learn about
are screaming foremen;

stinking toilets
that overrun the workroom;

winters without heat;

being charged for
the electricity they use,

the needles they sew with,
the very chairs they sit in.

Here, here in what
in only a few weeks will be...

the tenth year
ofthe twentieth century,

we have seen our
small strikes smashed,

our brave girls
battered by the goons...

and our own
New York policemen.

Yes, a general strike hangs
in the air here tonight...

Iike the smoke from
the flames within you,

the anger within you all.

Yes, the proper response
to these outrages...

is to be outraged.

And yet we say,

"Wait."

And yet we urge caution.

We are a new union,
not yet strong,

not strong enough
forvictory.

Our own Mr. Gompers,

he has just pleaded with you
to use deliberation,

to knowthatstrikes are
a methodoflast resort.

Approved, UCPA."

You may take that to the checkout

Uh, sir?. Maybe you
could help me.
Yes?.

Yes.
Nine fifty

Now, is that correct?.

No. That is neither
correct norjust.

I thought so.

Seven twenty. When you can
only afford
meat once a week,

or perhaps once every two weeks,
you've gotta be very careful.

Excuse me, I'm concerned

Yes, you're correct.

when we were interrupted.

What were we
talking about?.

We wasn't talkin'. You was
talkin'.
I wasn't talkin'.

Okay, so what
was I saying?.

I wasn't listening either.

You were doin'
the whole thing byyourself.
Whyweren'tyou listening?.

'Causeyou're a goddamn liar. I'm
not listenin'
toyou anymore, mister.

Three days now,
I ain't been listenin'.

Interrupted?.
You wasn't interrupted.

I got up and walked off.

Stop pretending to read.
You can't see anything.

Hey, why don'tyou go
and sit with them old dudes
in front ofthe welfare hotel?.

Them old butter-brains, why
don'tyou go
and mess with them?.

'Cause I ain't talkin'
toyou no more, mister.
Puttin' you on notice ofthat.

Y-You may as well be talkin'
to that tree over there.
That's a lamppost.

Sittin' here a whole week,
and not a word oftruth outta you.

Shuckin' me everywhich way,
till the sun go down.

I demand an explanation ofthat
last statement;
also a translation.

Okay, wiseass!

For example, areyou or areyou
not
an escaped Cuban terrorist?.

I am not. Okay. And
your name
is not Hernando?.

Absolutely not.
So it's a lie!

It's a cover story. My line
ofwork,
they give you a cover story.

Are you saying-- I'm
saying-- and
that's all I'm saying--

is that in my line ofwork,
my particular field,

you gotta have
a cover story.

Honey-bun, areyou sayin'
you're a spy?.

I'm saying
my name is Hernando,

and I'm an escaped
Cuban terrorist.

What kinda weirdo,
bullshit cover--

You don't think I said that to
them?.
That's what I said to them.

I said to them, "A former
Lithuanian citizen,

80-something years old,
is now a Cuban Hernando??"

"That's right. Tough
luck, sweetheart,"
they said.

"Yours not
to reason why--"

That's the way
they talk.

Of course you don't believe
it.
You think I believe it?.

Such dopes.
But it's a living.

Whywould they pick an old--
Do I know this?.
You tell me.

Ayear ago, I'm standing
in line at the Medicaid.

A fella comes up to me--
Boom.
I'm an undercover.

Lord. Who knows
why
they do these things?.

Maybe they got something there.
They figure, an old man like me,
nobody'll pay attention.

I could wander
through the world like a ghost,
maybe pick up a few tidbits.

Yeah?. Who knows what
they got
goin' on over there?.

I mean, you know, all right.
I grantyou they screwed up
on the cover story.

But listen, a thousand
bingos every month...

is added to my
Social Security check.

One thousand bananas
a month,

you don't ask
fancy questions.

Best not. Best not.

Soyou ever pick up
any information for 'em?.

Areyou kiddin'?.

Sitting on a bench
all day...

with a man
who can't tell...

a tree
from a lamppost?.

Not a shred.

The fact is,

I think they got me
in what they call...

deep cover.

They keepya in this
deep cover foryears.

Like five, maybe 1 0 years,
they keep you there,

till you're just like this
regular person
in the neighborhood.

Then, boom! They
pickyou out
for the big one.

Considering my age
and general health,

I don't think they're
too bright over there.

Okay, snack time.

Deep cover.

Yeah, I-I heard
about that.
Here.

We have a tuna fish
salad sandwich...

with lettuce and tomatoes
on whole-wheat toast.

Farm-fresh deli.

Yeah, that's a very,
very good s-store there.

Take half.
Thankyou.

Take this right here.
Ahh. Thankyou, sir.

Sure.
Thankyou, indeed.

Comes a certain time
in the day,

there's nothing like a fresh
tuna fish salad sandwich.

Uh-huh.
[ Laughing ]

Mmm.

Oh, yeah. It's crisp.

Mmm. Mmm.

Mmm.

Bingo, you've done it again!

Itwas nice. Nice long

Don't worry.

Twice lastyear.

You know, I was also
dead once for a while.

Six minutes.

They're doing a bypass,
a coronary bypass on me.
Everything stops.

They have to jump-start me
like a Chevrolet.

Six minutes dead,
the doctor said.

You know
what it's like?.

What?.
Boring.

your arms at all?.

Try to m-moveyour arms.

Make like that boxer.
Show me that Golden Gloves.

Yes. Very good.
Very good. That's good.

That's a good sign. That's

Put them down slowly.

All right.
Boys, he's all right.

Thankyou. Go fight

All right.

Now, from experience,

just lie there five minutes
and relax before getting up.

That was anotherlie,

No. No, it's a fact,
an absolute fact.

Man, you ain't even
friendly with the truth.

Your goddamn lies

Not lies. Alterations.

I make certain alterations.
Sometimes the truth don't fit.

I take in a little here,
I let out a little there,
till it fits. The truth?.

The truth is going to the
back door
ofthe Plaza Hotel...

everymorning
foryesterday's club rolls.

I tell them it's for the
pigeons.
I 'm the pigeon.

Six minutes dead is true, a
fact.
And that's my last fact.

This morning I'm talking
to the counterman at Farm Fresh.

I tell him I'm an
American Indian,
an Iroquois.

He I istens.

Pretty soon I 'm remembering
the days on the plains,

the broken treaties,
my grandpa fighting the cavalry.

Not important,
he's convinced.

I am. And I love it.

This morning I'm an American
Indian,
this afternoon a spy.

I was one person
for 80-something years.

Why not a hundred
for the next five?.

Them club rolls.

How early doyou think
a person ought to get there
to get them rolls?.

Rolls?. Rolls?.
You missed the whole point.

The point?.
I got the point.

The point is,
you are crazy!

Point is, you ain't never
seein' your marbles again!

Oh, how fortunate,

an expert
on mental health.

Crazy, you say?.
Listen to me.

Listen to a trained
observer. You are a wreck.

Is this who you wanna be?.

Is this what you had in mind
for old, this guy here,

sitting and staring, once in a
while for a thrill
falling down?.

No, you gotta shake things up,
fella.
You gotta make things happen.

You tellin' me how to
live?. You tellin' me?

What does a ghost know?.

People see me.
They see me.

I make them see me!

You crazy old fool!

They don't see you. They don't

I'm looking forward to it.

Looking forward

Had it on my schedule.

The man.
I been duckin' him.

He found me.
Who is he?

Pete Danforth. President
ofthe tenants' committee.

Place is goin' co-op.
He says they got a lot
of reorganizin' to do.

Says he wants
to see me private.

The problem is, it's gettin'
around the buildin' that...

I'm sorta nearsighted.

Nearsighted?. Helen
Kellerwas nearsighted.

[Continues ]

Cataracts in both eyes?.

Yeah.

How many times removed?.

Left, twice; right, once.
But they come back.

That's what they do.
They're dependable.

How bad is the glaucoma?.

Pills and drops keep it
down.
Except nighttime.

Nighttime's like tryin' to close
your lid over a basketball.
No lie.

No lie.

You get color
orblack-and-white?

Mostly blue.
Blue shadows, like.

Weird thing is, all my dreams
are in full color.

See everything real sharp and
clear,
like when I was young.

Then I wake up,

and it's real life
that looks like a dream.

Exactly.
The same with me, exactly.

I hadn't thought about it
till this minute.

Carter, we're connected.

You know why?.
Because we both got vision.

Who needs sight when we got
vision?.
Yes, we're connected.

Even with your
cowardly personality...

and your chickenshit
attitude, we are connected.

Our meeting with Danforth will go
well, I'm convinced.
"Our" meeting?.

I've decided to handle
this Danforth matter foryou.

The capitalist fat cats.

Don't worry,
I eat them for lunch.

Hold on, boy. I never
asked--
Don't thank me.

I ask for nothing in return,
only to see justice.

Don't thank me. Thank Karl
Marx.
Thank Lenin. Thank Gorky--

Don't need
none ofyou guys.

But mostlythank
Ben Gold.

Ben Gold, who organized
the furworkers...

and gave us a heart,
a center and a voice.

What a voice!
You thought it was yours.

I'm at his side
when we win.
Hey.

A 1 0%wage increase...

and the first
40-hourweek in the city!

We win! Where is he?.
Where's that Danforth?.

Bring him to me! Bring me
that fascist four-flusher!

Oh, my God. -All
right, the Soviet Union.

Throw it up to me.
Everybody does.

I promise you, Carter,
they lost me long ago.

Finished.
I gave up on them.

But I never gave up
on the ideas:

the triumph ofthe proletariat,
a workers' democracy.

The ideas are still fine
and beautiful.
The ideas go on!

They're better than
the people who had them.

Ben. They hit him with the
Taft-Hartley,
and the fire goes out.

The voice-- The
voice still goes on.

The conflict goes on like
the turning ofthe stars.

And we will crush Danforth
before supper time.

Okay, okay.

Danforth come, I don't
wantyou to speak.
Not a word.

Don't even want you here.
You got that?.

You open your face once,

I know this junkie, for
$50 will nail you permanent.

Am I comin' through clear?.
I have no choice.

I am obligated to getyou
offyour knees
and into the sunlight.

No, you ain't. I'm lettin' you
out ofthat
obligation right now.

Look, baby, it's okay.

I got it all figured out,
exactlywhat to say to him.

I just got to hang in
till I get my Christmas tips.

Theyjust gotta keep me four more
months--
Christmas?. Compromises?.

How doyou think
we lost Poland?.
Poland?.

Stalin sits at Yalta with a
twinkle in his eye.
Who knew?.

Stalin?.
Danforth has no right
to dismiss you beforeyour time.

Man, I am 81.

Afterwe finish with him,
tomorrow we go after
the rest ofhis kangaroo court.

Why, Lord?.

Why areyou
doing this to me?.

Lord, I askyou for help,

and you send me
a weird, commie, blind man!

Who is this Lord you're
talking to?.
W-What areyou do--

Oh, boy, I see I got
a lotta work to do here.
Okay.

The man's comin' soon.

Time for the man to come,
time foryou to go.

All right, Carter. Please
calm yourself!.
Come on, come on.

Carter, you're hysterical!
Calm yourself!.

All right, you'll handle
Danforth.
I'll permit it.

You mean it?.
Of course.

But firstyou must control and
calm yourself.
Calm myself. Yeah.

Here, this will do
the trick.

Here is some
government grass:

official, legal dope
from Uncle Sam.

Doctor prescribes,
government pays.

Two ounces a month
for the glaucoma.

Dilates the capillaries,

relieves the pressure...
everywhere.

Here.

I'll light it.

Here. All rolled, ready
to go.
Medicaid is paying.

Better not. Makes me
foolish sometimes, and this
is no time to get foolish.

Not foolish, happy.

I guaranteeyou'll laugh
at the 6:00 news.

Even your children
will become amusing.

Here, take a hit.
Danforth will be
a piece of cake.

One puff,
the man is a Danish.

You swear not to open your
mouth
when the man's come,

not to open it once,
I'll take a puff.

Agreed.

Direct from
the White House.

That's it. Hold it in.
Hold it! Hold it in.

I know. I was smokin' dope
whileyou was eatin'
matzo balls, baby.

[Calliope ]

[ Chuckling ]
Fair.

Just fair.

Man said, three miles.

Sure is takin' it slow.

Maybe he dropped
dead.
[ Both Chuckling ]

Young fella like him?.

Yeah, theyoung ones.

They're the first ones.
Boom!
[ Laughing ]

They're running,
they're smiling-- Boom!

[ Both Laughing ]

You should be here
in the evening.
What?.

They drop like flies.
Boom, boom, boom!

You mean, they drop when--

[ Muttering Incoherently,
Laughing ]

You see over there, that
steep rise
in the joggers' path?.

Yeah. Uh-huh.

I call it the
Runners' Graveyard.

[ Both Laughing ]

"The Runners' Grave--"

Let's go over there
and watch them drop.
Boom!

Boom, boom, boom!
[ Cackling ]

I saw a fat guy drop
the other day.

He musta weighed about
275 pounds.
[ Laughing ]

He fell down,
the whole earth shook.

The earth-- Boom, boom!
God, you couldn't believe it.

I thought it was
an earthquake. Boom1

Howdy.

Well, now, Johnson &Johnson

Mighty fine.

Hmm. Hmm.

[ Calliope ]

You know that guy

[ Continues ]

Standard & Poor, how're

Standard & Poor, doing

Whoa, whoa, whoa. We got GM up at

Well, then, we best be dumpin'

Poor: mutual funds,

The bellhas rung, boys.
No newbusiness.

The bell has rung. No
new business.
Bell has rung.

[ Violin ]

What are you
gettin' in?.

[ Midge ]
Whole mess ofdiamonds
tossed on a piece ofglass.

That would be
the pond in the sunlight.

[ Continues ]

[ Nat ] Now we
have a pretty girl.

[ Midge ]
Howyou know?

Because ofthe glow.

When I could see,
all pretty girls had a glow.

Now what's left is the glow.
That's how you can tell.

Stopped smokin' dope
when I turned 70.

That girl just went
from very pretty...

to beautiful.

Scared of goin' foolish.

My old man went foolish
fiveyears before he died.

Didn't know his
own name. Sad to see.

[ Continues ]

Sure hope I ain't the
only one
hearin' that music.

Now she's Hannah Pearlman.
Who?

worked
as a finisher,

stitching linings
inyachting caps
forShiffman's.

Shiffman's Chapeaux,

West Broadway, 1 927.

[ Continues ]

No, ain't her.

I 'll tell you
who you got there.

That's Ella Mae Tilden.

Ella Mae,
best wife I ever had.

Number three.
Five, all told.

Very shy,
shier even than me.

She used to sit on the stoop
in the early evening.

Fine, fine face,
like an artist wouldpaint.

LudlowStreet, 4 18.

I passed that stoop
a million times.

I couldn't say, "Hello. "

She would sit
in the early evening,

with her hands hidden,

I i ke so, from the funny--
funny fi ngers that she had
from the stitching.

Ella Mae give meJohn,
John give me Billy,

and Billy give me
these teeth. [ Laughing ]

Put the teeth in, smiled...
and left Ella Mae.

Smile needed a new hat.

Hat made me walk
a new way,

which was out.
But she was married.

Went to work so her greenhorn
husband
could go through law school,

become an American somebody.

ComesJune,
herhusband graduates.

Suddenlyfinds out
he's an attorney...

with a Yiddish-speaking wife
who finishes yachting caps.

Boom, he leaves her for a
smooth-fingered
Yankee Doodle...

that he met at law school.

Four months later,
Hannah "took the gas, "

a popular expression
at that time...

for puttingyour head
in an oven.

[ Midge ] Poor
Ella Mae cryin ',

me hearin 'my new mouth
say, "Good-bye. "

She was near 70 then,

but when my mind moves
to her,

she 's fresh-peach prime.

Ella Mae,
best wife I ever had.

[ Nat ] September, a
month
before she took the gas,

I see Hannah in the
Grand Street Library.

I'm at the main table
with the Free Voice of Labor.

I look up.
There's Hannah Pearlman.

She's got her head buried in a
grammar book
for a 1 0-year-old.

She looks up.
She knows me. She smiles.

My heart goes di rectly...
i nto my ears.

Bang, bang, bang.
I 'm deaf.

I don't speak.

I'm in the house ofwords,
and I can't speak.

I didn't speak.

I didn't speak!

There's dope
that makesya laugh,

and dope that
makes ya cry.

I think this here's
cryin' dope.
Stop it1

Stop nostalgia!
I hate it.

The dread disease
of old people.

It kills more ofus
than heart failure.

When was the last time
you made love to a woman?.

Listen to him.
More nostalgia.

My poor shmeckle.
Talk of nostalgia.

It comes up once a year,
like Groundhog Day.

Last time
was July 1 0, 1 981.

Was yourwife still alive?.
I certainly hope so.

Yousee, the last time forme,
I-I-I was bein'unfaithful.

Goddamn my fickle soul.

Cheated on 'em all.

Daisy. I was 76.

Still had somethin'
on the side, somethin' new.

Carter, this is
the most courageous thing
I ever heard aboutyou.

No courage to it.
It's a curse.

No,you were right.
You dared, andyou did.

I yearned and
regretted. I envyyou.

You were always what I have just
recently become.
A di rty old man.

Romanticist.

A man of hope.

You listen to me. I was
dead once,
so I know things.

It's not the sex.
It's the romance.

Now finally I know this.

Shmeckle is out ofbusiness,
still the romance remains.

The adventure,
that's all there everwas.

The body came along
for the ride.

Doyou understand me,
Carter?.

I'm thinkin' about it.

Because, frankly,

right now I'm in love
with this girl overhere.

[Midge ]
Well.

Got to admit,
so am I.

Son of a gun.

First time I ever been
in love with a white woman.

The first time?.
Why the first time?.

J ust happened that way.

All the others were black?.
The rest were black?.

Listen, you ran around
with a wild commie crowd.

Where I come from,
you're stuckwith your own.

Being a black
man, I-- What?.

A black man.
What?.

A black man.

Wait a minute.
Stop. Excuse me.

My God, you're right.

You are a black man.

[ Chuckling ]

[ Both Laughing ]

You devil. You thought
that I was--
[ Laughing ]

You devil!

[ Laughing Continues ]
I am, by God!

My God,
you are a black man!

Stop, stop!

By God,
you are a black man!

[ Laughing ]
Oh, stop!

I am going to die...
right here!

[ Both Laughing ]

I'm gonna drop dead
right here.

[ Laughing ] Wait a minute,
Carter.
Hold it. Wait a minute.

Is it--
Is it this funny?.

Definitely,
this is funny!

This is
absolutely funny!

I can't tell you!

[ Mumbling Incoherently,
Laughing ]

[ Chuckling ]

[ Snoring ]

How doyou like this?.

Onejoint. Look at him.

[ Snores ]

I'm Alabamy bound

There'll be no
heebie-jeebies
hangin' 'round

Just give the meanest
ticket man on earth

All I'm worth
[ Laughs ]

To put mytootsies
in an upper berth

You hear that
choo-choo sound
Woo-woo

I know that soon I'm
gonna cover ground
Oh, yeah!

And then I'll holler
so the world will know

Here I go

I'm Alabamy bound

Just hear that
choo-choo sound
Woo-woo

I know that soon
I'm gonna cover ground

And then I'll holler so
the world will know
Here I go

Woo-woo So the
world will know

Here I go

So the world will know

Here I go

I'm Alabamy
He's Alabamy

We're Alabamy bound

[ Laughing ]

[Applause ]

Yea!
[ Laughing ]

I think that woman
is crazy about us.

Of course. Got any
more
ofthat dope?.

Now, listen, Carter, we're
gonna do
the "Willy Howard routine."

Now, you are the straight man,
Carter, and I'm Willy Howard.

Whatever I say, you say,
"I'm not Rappaport."
You got that?.

[Midge ] Yeah, I
got it. Yeah.
Okay.

Stand there.

Now picture we just met.
I'm not Rappaport.

No, no, not yet.
Not yet.

Yeah, yeah.
Okay?.

Hello, Rappaport.

I'm not Rappaport.

Rappaport, what happened
to you?. You used to be
a short, fat guy.

Now, you're a tall,
skinny guy.
I'm not Rappaport.

Rappaport, you used to be
a young guywith a beard.
Now you're old with a mustache.

What happened to you?.
I'm not Rappaport.

Rappaport, what happened
toyou? You used to
dress up nice.

Now you got old, dirty
clothes.
I am not Rappaport.

And you changed
your name too!

[ Chuckles ]

[ Both Laughing ]

And you changed
your name too. Lord.

[ Laughing ]

[ Laughing Continues ]
You changed your name too.
Boy, that's a--

[ Laughing Continues ]

Thereyou are, Carter.

Carter1 [ Laughing
Stops ]
Oh, shit, he's here.

[ Panting ] Couldn't
find you.
[Midge Laughs ]

Ah, excellent.
He's here.

I gotta shape up. Look, are
you my friend, baby?.
Of course.

Then, friend,
sit over there.

And don't open your mouth.
Not a word, mister. Please.

You call me when you need
me?.
Soon as I need you. Please.

Okay.
Over there.
Over there.

Okay.

[ Sighs ]

Remember, I'm ready.

I know that.

Beautiful daylike today,
you must've lost track.
Hey, man.

[ Chuckling ]
Hi.

I don't think we've ever
been formally introduced.
I'm Pete Danforth.

Hi, Pete. They call
me Midge.
Hi, Midge.

[Sighs ]

[ Panting ]

Glad we decided to meet in
the park. It's a chance for me
to stay outside after my run.

The truth is, I hate running.
Being immortal takes
too much time.

[ Chuckles ]
"Midge" for midget.

Third wife give me
that name.

Near three-quarter inches
tallerthan me,
so she called me "Midge".

Name stuckwith me
50 years.

I tell you one thing,
it is good to be reminded
what a great park this is.

It's a goddamned oasis
in the middle
ofthejungle.

Next twowives
was normal-sizewomen.
Don't make much sense.

Still stuckwith the
name of"Midge".
[ Chuckles ]

I mean, look at
this wonderful... house...

full of old boats.

What do they call
this place, Midge?.
They call it the old boathouse.

[ Laughing ]
Damn right.


[Saxophone ]

[ Clara ]
Dad?

Dad?.

[ Rain Falling ]

[Danforth ] Those were
the days,
weren't they?

I mean, look at this.
And this place.
And the lake.

I mean, even in the rain
I just-- I just love this park.

And luckily-- luckily
my teaching schedule gives me
two free afternoons a semester.

A chance to really use
the park.
It's been years.

Oh, I teach Communication Arts
over at the Manhattan Institute
on 60th.

There's no air
in the place.

What kind of arts?.
Ah, communication.

Communication ofall kinds;
personal, interpersonal
and public.

You teach talkin'?.
More or less, yes.

Soyou must know we about at the end
ofthe chitchat
section now, right?.

Right. Right.

The problem that we've
got here--
Here, have a seat.

Uh, the problem we've
got here hadn't come
to my attention sooner...

simply becauseyou, personally,
hadn't come to my attention.

Frankly, I've been living there for
threeyears;
I've never run intoyou.

Mostlydown in the boilerroom.
Don't get many drop-ins.

[ Chuckles ] Of
course.
Keep movin', boy.

You're on a roll now.
[ Chuckles ]
Yes, well.

Um, as you know, 32 1 is
going co-op
in November.

We'll be closing on that
in November.

We've got Brachman and Rader
as our managing agent. I think
they're doing an excellent job.

And as president of
the tenants' committee,
I'm pretty much dependent--

well, the whole committee is
really-- on their advice.

We've basically got to place
our faith in the recommendations
ofthe managing agency.

And they're recommending
you dump me?.

Midge, we've got some real
problems aboutyour remaining
with the building staff.

Ain't that the same
as dumpin' me?.

Well, it's not for eightweeks.
It's not till November.

But, yes, wewill
have to letyou go.

Now, there are
various benefits. There's
the union pension plan.

There's six weeks' severance pay.
Now that's a check for six weeks'
salary the dayyou go.

That's--
Midge, I'm sorry.

God, I hate this. I--

How 'bout I hate it first,
then you get your turn?.

Time, Midge.

Time is the only
villain here. Man.

Man, we're all
fighting it.

Jesus. Haveyou seen me
run?. It's a joke.
[ Laughs ]

I can't do the things I did
a fewyears ago either.

Hey, don't sweat it, son.

You see, Brachman and Rader,
all due respects, full of shit.

The fact is, you need me. You got
an old Erie City
boiler down there.

Things about that weird machine
no living man knows
except Midge Carter.

Take me till Christmas.
Christmas, yeah. Train a new
man how to handle that devil.

Midge, we're replacing
the Erie City.

We're installing a fully
automatic Rockmill 500.

It requires
no maintenance.

You see, the Rockmill
is just one ofmany steps in an
extensive modernization plan--

Well, nowyou're
gonna need me.

Pipes and wires, and 40 years
oftemporary stuff.
That's whatyou got there.

With no blueprint to showyou where
it is.
And I got it all in my head.

I know what's behind everywall,
every stretch oftar.
So, here's the deal.

My place in the basement, I
stay on there for free
like I been.

You get all my consulting free,
no salary. Beauty deal foryou.

Midge, your unit in the basement
is being placed on the co-op
market as a garden apartment.

Please understand,
we've had a highly qualified
team ofbuilding engineers--

Forget it!
They've done this survey.

I'm not interested in the job, no
otherjob.
I'm withdrawing my offer.

No, Midge, please listen.
All this time I've been
living in a garden apartment.

Wish I'd have known sooner.
I'd have had a whole lot
of more parties.

I'm sorry.
The problem is--

The problem is you giving me
"bad guy news" trying to look
like a good guy doing it.

You're right. You're
right, Midge.
You're dead right.

I have handled this whole thing
badly;
just stupidly, stupidly.

Oh, I'm sorry, this-- this
whole thi--
Oh, this is terrible.

Don't worry about it, Pete.
You'll get through it.

No, no, Midge, wait,
please.

[Thunderclap ]
I'm gonna getyou... ten weeks'
severance, Midge. Forget six.

A check for ten weeks' salary
the dayyou go. I'm gonna
hand it to you personally.

And ifthat committee
doesn't like it, well then,
just... to hell with them.

I'm just gonna shove it through.
It's the least I can do.

Ten weeks' severance, Midge.
Now how does that sound toyou?.
Well, better than six, I guess.

Wait, wait--
It's a promise, Midge. Gonna
shove it down their throats.

I'm sure I'm gonna have no trouble
with that committee.
Unacceptable1

We find that unacceptable.

Mr. Danforth. Mr. Danforth,
I'll speak frankly.

You are in a lot oftrouble, sir.
Ben Reissman; Reissman,
Rothman, Rifkin and Grady.

Forgive me for not
announcing myselfsooner,

but I couldn't resist listening
toyou buryyourself.

Myfirm represents Mr. Carter
overthere,
but more to the point.

We act as legal advisors to the H
U RTSFOE unit
of Mr. Carter's union.

H U RTSFOE-- I refer to
the Human Rights Strike Force,

who, I'm sorryto tellyou,
you'll be hearing a lot from
in the next few weeks.

Personally, I think their
methods are a bit too extreme,

but I report and advise.

That's all I can do. The ball
is rolling here,
Mr. Danforth.

Go away.

[ Chuckles ] Mr. Carter
keeps telling us
to go away,

but as he knows we are an
automatic function
ofhis union...

for the protection of all
members;
I have no choice.

The man wants to give me ten
weeks' severance.
[Nat ]Ajoke1

The man is a "jokester."

Look, Reissman--
Yes, speak to me.

I'm not sure I understand
the situation.
Of course not. How could you?.

Here, sit down, I'll
explain it toyou.
I'll educateyou.

Sit down. The
situation is simple.

We don't accept 1 0 weeks'
severance. We don't accept
20 weeks' severance.

What we accept is that
you retain Mr. Carter in
the capacity of advisor...

during your reconstruction
period, which I assume
will take a year, maybe two,

at which point, we'll talk
further.
I don't know this man.

I don't know him.

Ofcourse not. Mr.
Carteris more familiar...

with Rifkin and Grady, the
gentler gentlemen
of our firm.

It was thought best to
bring the "Cobra"
in on this one.

It's an affectionate term for
me at the office.
Look, Reissman.

Yes, speak to me. I don't
know what
your game is, fella,

and I don't knowyour
organization, but I do know
Local 32 ofthe Service Employ--

And do they know thatyou are
planning
to fire Mr. Carter?.

Notyet, but--

Anddoyou knowthat there is
no mandatoryretirement age
in Mr. Carter's union?

Do you know further that this
gives Mr. Carter the right...

to call an arbitration hearing
where he can defend
his competence?.

And thatyou have to get a minimum
offourtenants
to testifyagainst him?

Find them. I would love to see
this, Mr. Danforth.
[ Thunderclap ]

Four tenants who wanna
be responsible--

publicly responsible
for putting this old man...

out ofhis home
andprofession of42years.

A man who was voted
"Super OfThe Year"...

by the New York Post
in 1 968.

A man who fought
in World War II.

A man who served
with the now legendary
Black Battalion ofBastogne...

during the
Battle ofthe Bulge.

And are you aware that
for as long as you insist
on pursuing this matter,

for as long as this hearing
lasts, thatyou can make
no contract with Local 32?

And that without
a union contract, there
can be no co-op sales---

no building corporation1

Time, my friend,
will be your villain now!

I'm talking months, cookie.

I'm talking litigation,
appeals,

the full weight and guile...

of Rothman, Rifkin,
Grady and the Cobra.

I'm--
Speak to me.

I'm, frankly,
a little thrown by this.

I knew about the right
to arbitration, Midge.

I never thoughtyou'd want to
putyourselfthrough something--
He wants!

Meanwhile, HURTSFOE goes
afteryou tomorrow anyway.

-They'll make an example ofyou.
You're perfect for them!
-What have I done?.

Sir, you have hit every
human rights' nerve there is.
I'm talking old.

I'm talkingblack. I'm talking
racial imbalance.
Racial imbalance?.

The man was walking into walls
for God's sake.
He's an easy 80.

There is nothing, sir,
I promise you,
easy about 80.

Damn it, why am
I bothering to warn you?.

You'll see it all tomorrow.
Time to let HURTSFOE
out ofits cage.

I find it hard to believe I
would be
held responsible--

You will believe tomorrow
when you see those pickets
in front ofyour school!

What's the name ofthatplace?
The Manhattan Institute.

Then those demonstrators in
front
ofyour apartment building,

the name Danforth will
become an adjective, sir.

A new word for the persecution
ofthe old and disabled,
the black and the blind.

Now, wait a minute!
Do it, Danforth!
Do it!

Fire him1 It'syour
one shot
at immortality.

Yes, I'm sorry, Carter. I
wanna see HURTSFOE
in action again.

Those crazywildcats.
Those mad, inspired men.

I wanna hear those words
alive again and pure:

"Strike for humane existence.
Strike for universal justice.

"Strike! Strike! Strike!
Strike!
[ Chanting ] Strike!

Strike! Strike--"
Hold on.
Wait a minute!

Now this whole goddamn mess
has just gotten out ofhand here!

Now, look, Reissman,

believe me, this was never
my own personal thing.

I represent a committee--

I'm sorry. The spotlight
falls on you because it must;

becauseyou are so
extraordinarily ordinary;

because there are
so many ofyou now.

You collect old furniture,
old cars, old pictures,
everything old but old people.

Bad souvenirs,
they talk too much.

Even quiet,
they tell you too much.

They look like the future,
and you don't wanna know.

Hey, mister,
don'tyou know...

one dayyou too will join
this weird tribe?.

Yes, Mr. Chairman,
you will get old.

Andifyou're frightened now,
you'll be terrified then.

The problem is not that life is
short,
but that it's very long.

So you better
have a pol icy.

Here, look at us.

Here we are. We're
the coming attractions.

And ifyou're afraid of it,
you'll be afraid of us.

You'll wanna hide us or make us
hide from you.
You're dangerous.

Don'tyou understand?.

The old people, they're the
survivors;
they know something.

Theyhaven'tjuststayedlate
to ruinyourparty.

Whatyou'd like is for Carter to be
nice and cute
and quiet and go away.

But he won't do that.
I won't let him.

Tell him he's slow
or stupid, okay.

But tell him he's
unnecessary, and that's a sin!

That is a sin
against life!

That is abortion
at the other end!

Ben, I'm glad you shared these
thoughts with me.
I'd never really--

I'm through communicating
with you.

Carter, I'm communicating
onlywith you now.

What shall we dowith him?.
I leave it up toyou.

I-- I thinkwe ought
to give him a break.

Ben, I-I-I'm sure I can persuade
the members ofthe committee
to reevaluate Midge's--

Areyou saying you don't
care what
happens to the cause?.

You just wanna keepyourjob,
Midge, and forget the cause?.

Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
Keep the job and forget the cause.

Guys, I think it's essential
that we avoid any extreme--

Areyou asking the Cobra
not to strike?.

Don't want the Cobra
to strike, no.

Mr. Danforth, my client has
instructed me to save your ass.

Quickly,
the bomb is ticking.

Jog home to your phone now.
Call the members ofyour committee.

Don't persuade. Don't
explain. Just announce.

Tell them there's a job
for Mr. Carter--

guide, counselor, superintendent
emeritus; that has a nice sound to it.

Meanwhile, speak to no one. Your
union, your managing agent, no one.

HURTSFOE gets wind ofthis,
we're all in trouble. Here.

When you're finished,
call that number...

before 1 0:00 tomorrow if
you wanna stop HURTSFOE.

Park East Real Estate?. Yes. Yes.
That's HURTSFOE's advisory group.

Speak only to the lady
on the card, Mrs. Clara Gelber.

Tell her to reach Bartley
at the HURTSFOE office.
Bartley.

Bartleywill know what to do.
Good-bye and good luck.

Midge, Ben,

I just wantyou
to know that...

this has been a very important
conversation for me for many reasons.

A lot of primary thoughts.
Excellent. Good-bye.

An important exchange ofideas.
A sudden awareness of certain
generational values--

I warn you, sir,
one more word and I will
make a citizen's arrest...

for crimes
against the language.

Go now! It's true. I sometimes
just don't know how to talk--

Go!

Go to the phone! Let me
see those sneakers, Flash.

Truth is I always did
wanna be a lawyer, but years
ago there was so many choices.

Black Battalion

We ain't never getting awaywith
this. They gonna catch on to us.

minutes ago?. You still gotyourjob?.
