He's coming back.

Eric is coming back.

True love they say comes
only once in a lifetime.

What they don't tell you...

...is that sometimes,
you wait a lifetime for love.

Some said it contained gold,
but I knew better.

My Uncle said it was cursed,
but his mind was small.

A locked trunk he
said meant secrets.

And those who had secrets
could never find a home.

I didn't know if what
he said was true...

...but it was true
enough for me.

Something for the journey.

And I suppose I'll have no dinner.

Don't let him take it from you.

Not a word, speak to
no one you understand?

Your father will be waiting.

I'm sorry...

Morgan take care of her!
You hear me?

I've never really
known a home.

My father was often gone,
my mother was a mystery.

The trunk and
I were companions

moved easily from
place to place.

Every time he left,
my father told me

that what he was
leaving behind

was the most precious
thing in the world.

Perhaps he spoke of me.

They called him the Captain.

The remnant of a title
from a forgotten past.

He'd given up the seas
for the desert highways.

For what some said;
was a delusional journey

for lost Civil War gold.

The gold had been entrusted to the care

of my Great-Grandfather.

The treasure meant for
the glory of the South.

When the war ended...

The Captain called
it his "inheritance."

You'll be safe enough.
He'll be here soon


I cared little for the treasure...

...but I would stay
with the trunk.

My father always
came back to it.

And brought with him
the bitter spoils of war.

Men who were loyal
to one thing only...

...the gold!

Do you see him?

I've lost him!

Where is he?

He's over there!

You go that way!

Taggart!

Captain.

That's a prodigious
amount of blood

for a man without a heart.


Captain!

You're alive!

You doubted?


They left the truck, but
I don't see the journal.

Captain?

The crossroads...
in Withersby.

It will be with my daughter.

Bring it, or burn it.

Destroy it if you must!

Eric...

Bring me my daughter.

I will bring her.

You swear it?

I swear it.

Precious cargo...

...to be left alone and lonely.

Where's the girl?


What are you doing?

We must know that
it's the Captain's chest

Leave it, there'll
be time later.

We need to find the girl.

Now Eric, I'm very sorry.

But I'm afraid our
paths must part here.

I should have known you were
no different than the others.

Now stand aside.

And if I don't?

Don't be foolish.



You were a noble lad.

Not wise, but noble.

You'll return to the Captain,
as you promised.

A stowaway?

I don't know where you
thought you were going boy...

But I promise you, this isn't...

Swim lad!

Welcome to your new home!


The boat!

Where's the boat?

What's he looking for?

Well, what's he looking for?

I don't know.
I thought we were alone.

So did I.

You thought we were alone,
or you were alone?

Well I knew I wasn't alone,
but I thought we were alone.

Him and you, or you and me?

How can you and
I be alone, he's here.

But you said you
thought we were alone!

I never said that I was alone.

How can I be
alone you're here?

Who are you?

I could ask you
the same question.

Do you always answer a
question with a question?

I don't know.

You don't know if you
always answer a question

with a question, or you
don't know who you are?

Shhh! Of course I know
who I am, I'm not simple.

Though I'm not
sure about you.

Wait!

Where are you going?

I can't leave yet,
I have to find my father.

Well he can't be here.

Do you know him?
Do you know where he is?

How would I
know your father?

Well you said that...
he couldn't be here...

...I thought maybe that...

It doesn't mean
anything. We're alone!

Who's alone?

Never mind.

You are a very
frustrating young man.

Wait... I'm afraid
I'm rather lost.

Do you think you
could help me?

Of course.

My name is...

My name is Chris.

Well my name is...

My name is...

I'm sure he'll be very nice.

[DISGUSTED SIGH]

$14.95 for a no-show.

Sam, I'm leaving
with or without you.

I think maybe I'll walk back.

Well, we can't just leave
him alone out here.

Just don't bring him home.

Cause I'm not feeding
any more of your strays.

You're him ain't ya?

Well, you're not
much to look at.

Do you know where I can
find Rosemary Dalton?

You just missed her.

I thought I told you
not to bring him home!

Mom you might want
to hang on to something.

It's him, it's J.T. Swinton!

It can't be!

So is there another
J.T. Swinton?

Yes Ma'am, I'm J.T. Junior.

And J.T. Senior?

He's my father.

So why didn't he come out?

He's dead.

What happened?

I'd rather not talk about it.

Look I just got this letter
saying the old lady died.

And she left this
place to him. And now...

...I'm the only one left.

I don't mean to run you out...

...but I'll probably never
have a chance like this again.

I'm going to sell it.

Boy you are going to have
to pay somebody

just to take this
place off your hands.

[Rose laughs]

So what do we do with him?

Doesn't seem like
he wants to stay.

I'm sure he just
wants to go home.

That's him?

In the pink.

Ain't much to look at, is he?

Why does everybody
keep saying that?

I'm going to tell you like it is.

You just don't look like you've
got $175,000 dollars on you.

It was J.T. Senior
we were after.

We got J.T. Junior.

I'm sorry we brought
you out here for nothing.

Henry says he can take you back to the
crossroads.

And there's at bus at 7:30.

Won't be no trouble.

Wait a minute.
What about my ranch?

You didn't tell him?

Tell me what?

Your Aunt Christine owes
$175,000 in back taxes.

If the taxes don't get paid...

The "law" is
giving us 30 days.

And if we don't come
up with the money...

...well, let's just say it's
going to be a little crowded

sleeping in the truck.

Now I ain't got
nothing to do with it.

The property goes to foreclosure auction

if somebody doesn't
make the payment.

And you were hoping my dad
would come up with the money?

They were just trying
to save the ranch.

How much is this
place worth anyways?

I mean, if we can
clear $175,000

I can keep the rest, right?

Well, strictly speaking...

You don't really own the ranch.

On account of Aunt
Christine isn't dead yet!

So, who sent out the
letter saying I was dead?

It wasn't a bad idea.

Not if he had $175,000.

Yeah well, I'll be gone
first thing in the morning.

We could use
the Captain's gold.

Sam Dalton, you've
got pig spit for brains.

C'mon Christine,
let's get you back to bed.

Just 'cause you
haven't seen it

doesn't mean it don't exist.

If we could find the chest...

Sam, Honey,
I haven't seen it...

You haven't seen it...
ain't nobody ever seen it!

C'mon Honey.

I know where my room is.

I was just trying to help.

So where are you going?

What does it matter?

It doesn't.

Then I could be
going anywhere.

What difference does it make?

I wondered what kind of person

walks out on his
only living relative.

You've got to be kidding me!

You lied to me to
get me out here.

And you wrote me a letter
saying my Aunt was dead!

It could be true... soon enough.

That old buzzard?

She's going to live
till she's a hundred

You saw her on a good day.

Some days it ain't so good.

So you're still going to leave?

Nothing to keep me here.

What about the gold?

What about it?

What is it? Some kind of
buried treasure or something?

Yeah, something like that.

And you really think it's real?

Aunt Christine, we
need his help.

We gotta cut him in.

Fine.

How much?

50 percent.

Done.

Aunt Christine!
You already promised me 50 percent.

And with your
50 percent and his...

Well, it just don't add up.

Let's find it first,
we'll fight over it later.

How much is there?

Why should I give you a nickel?

Because I'm your only
living relative, that's why.

And I haven't decided if
I'm going to claim you yet.

Fine, I'll just wait till you're dead.

Yeah, and I'll give it all to charity.

Look Ma'am, I didn't really
ask to be a part of all this.

Why are you here?

[Wind blows]

[SEA WHISTLE & BELL]

Be careful child.

He's not what he seems.

Aunt Christine, what
did you mean?

You said, "be careful, he's
not what he seems."

Who isn't what he seems?

What were you looking at?

Can you tell us?

I don't remember.

She's a loony toon.

You coming, or are you just
going to stand there and yap?

You're not actually
going out there are you?

Are you always planning
on being this difficult?

Cause if you are...
I want a new partner.

Sam wait, whoa! She's crazy!

You said so yourself.

Look J.T., I didn't want to
say anything, but I have proof.

You mean like actual, tangible,
poke-you-in-the-eye proof?

Actual, tangible,
poke-you-in-the-eye proof.

Well let's see it.

Alright, come with me.

J. T: Now I know I'm
related to Aunt Christine.

Sam: How's that?

J. T: We're both crazy!

So what happens if we get lost?

That's impossible.

How come?

All you have to do, is keep
rowing till you reach land.

Then you start walking.

You're bound to find
something within a week or two.

You ever been here before?

Lots of times.

How many times is
"lots of times?"

Twice.

There you go!

Where I go?

Poke-you-in-the-eye proof.
It's the camp.

What camp?

The camp she was brought to
when she came to the island.

Oh come on! This
doesn't prove anything.

I mean this thing's been
here for like a jillion years.

It could be anyone's.
It could be...

...some old
sheepherder's camp.

Uh' huh, and how
would they get here?

Who?

The sheep?

What sheep?

You said it was an
old sheepherders cabin.

How would he
get the sheep here?

It's an island!

You know you're not
working very hard

for your 50 percent
of the fortune.

You know, 50 percent of
nothing is still nothing.

So what are we looking for?

Some kind of clue.

I'm going to go... see what
I can find down here.

Sam, I found something!

Wow, a hinge.

What do you think?

What makes you think a
hinge would be important?

We need a real clue.

What, like a treasure map?

A map, a sign, something.

What is it?

Is this yours?

Of course not.

Maybe it belongs
to your sheepherder.

Maybe.

What's this?

I don't know, a box?

What do you think this is?

Do you think
it's worth anything?

Let's go.

Where are we going?

We gotta go
show Aunt Christine.

Where's Aunt Christine?

In her room I'm sure.

How do you like
that Key Lime pie?

What are you doing?

What do you mean,
what am I doing?

Who's the beau?

That's J.T. Swinton,
he's Christine's nephew.

So? What're y'all doing?

Now Sam, that's really not
any of your business, is it?

If it was, and it ain't...
I would tell you

I invited Turner over for a
piece of my Key Lime pie.

Hmmm!

You don't make pie.

As I said, that's really not any
of your business, now is it?

Why don't you kids run
outside and play.

Delicious!

It's a sextant.

It's an instrument used
to navigate the ocean.

Why was it on the island?

You found that on the island?

Did you find the window?

What window?

The window in the rock.
That's where Eric and I -

Whoa, whoa! How can there
be a window in a rock?

Who's Eric?

Aunt Christine, I think maybe you
better start from the beginning.

You've got to
remember something.

Where you came from?

How long you've been here?

Something?

Your mother's name, what
was your mother's name?

Why would I remember
my mother's name?

I don't know.

Did you have any pets?

Ohhh!

What!

I just remembered
Ferris Bolton.

Who the devil is Ferris Bolton?

He was a friend of mine.

He lived in a farm
across the valley.

One day he hit
his head on a rock...

...and he couldn't remember
anything for two days.

Well, what happened to him?

He died.

But! Just before he died,
he remembered everything.

His mind was
jostled by a sound.

What was it?

One of his cows.

He sprung up, said he was late
for milking, and fell over dead.

Excellent!

So that means I need to
find a cow from my childhood

And I'll remember everything!

Don't be ridiculous.

We just need to
jostle your brain.

I'm afraid to ask how
you propose to do that.

Do you remember
how you got here?

Not a thing.

Was it a boat?
Did you come by boat?

It's an island. How else
would I have gotten here?

Right. Then do you
remember where your boat is?

I have no boat.

What do you mean
you have no boat?

You just said you came by boat.

No, no, two days ago...

I came upon Samuel's
boat carefully hidden.

That's how I knew he was here.

And I remember thinking
a boat would be useful

since I didn't have one.

Ohhhh!

Must you keep doing that?

What is it?

You remembered his name!

Yes!

It's Samuel.

Samuel Taggart.

Chris: Do you think
this is a good idea?

Chris: You've been
watching him for days.

Chris: It's obvious
you know him.

Chris: There must be some
reason you haven't gone to him.

Eric: Maybe. But if he
knows something

Eric: I've got to
find out what it is.

Chris: There's something
not right about this.

Samuel?

Eric!

I must admit, I had
not expected to see you.

You've come for
your share I suppose?

My share?

You want it all then!

Well you'll have to find it first
and I'll not give it willingly.

Samuel, I need your help.

The journal? You'll not have it.

The journal? I don't want...

You've found it haven't you?

You've beaten me to it!

What now? Here to
titter in my face?

I need to talk to you Samuel.

Please you have to listen to me.

No!

It's you who'll listen to me.

Let's have it.
What have you done with the gold?

The gold, I have no gold.

Samuel please, you've got
to believe me!

I don't know what the game is,
but we'll have no more of it.

What my food? The boat?

What have you come for?

This needn't be difficult.

You bring me the money, and
I'll split it with you as we agreed.

Now what will it be?

Wait! Get back here!

Nooo!

Gather your things,
we can't stay here.

Where will we go?

Somewhere... away from here.

Eric.

Eric.

I think I have something
that belongs to you.

Is it helping?

Not a wit.

But you know who you are...

Yes, I'm Eric DuBois.

I was... or am... a soldier.

A soldier of fortune
it would appear.

And Samuel Taggart was
my ally. Though no longer.

But that...

A letter to my Captain...

...telling him I will join
him at summer's end.

Does nothing to jostle this.

There's... one more
thing I can tell you.

The Captain is my father.

The Captain you say
was a man of honor.

And yet this honorable man

surrounds himself
with what kind of men?

Men who would kill
each other over a bounty.

You're not a killer.

Perhaps I'm not now.

But what was I?

Where do you think he is?

Looking for us.

Watch for Taggart.

He's not here.

What do you mean?

See for yourself.

Chris.

Chris!

There!

I'll never find him, will I?

Yes!

A very fine specimen indeed!

How much is it worth?

I'll give you $200 for it.

I could make that $225,
but that's as high as I can go.

What were you hoping for?

175...

Well then, what's the...
Thousand!

Ah. I see.

Well, you do have
a bit of a problem then.

We know.

Thanks. We'll let you know
if we decide to sell it.

No problem. Glad to help.

Oh no, Rose, no!
Whatever it is, no!

Hello children, did you
have a nice trip into town?

Rose, don't do this,
whatever it is, don't do it.

I really haven't the slightest
idea what you're talking about.

Mom, tell me please.

I got a call today
from Turner Desmond.

Well actually it wasn't
so much a call from him,

as it was me calling Turner.

What did he want?

He wants to buy the ranch.

Well that's great news!
I thought no one was interested.

He doesn't count Mom,
he doesn't want to buy the ranch.

He wants... something else.

Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

We could still live here...

...and he'll live, hmm...
wherever it is he lives.

Mom, marriage doesn't
work that way.

I don't get it.

much want to buy the ranch

as he wants to marry Rose.

If Rose decides to marry Turner,
Rose will marry Turner.

It certainly makes a
sight more sense

than a cockamamie
search for fool's gold.

Eric! You've got to get Samuel
to tell you where my father is.

And how do you
propose we do that?

Last time we spoke,
he tried to kill me.

What then? We've nothing left.

The journal.

Of what hope is the journal?

It will lead us to the gold.

I thought you were different.

If we find the gold, perhaps we
might trade it for information.

About my father?

And about me.

Uhhhh!

How do we even know
this is the right place?

I mean, he probably
can't even read.

Never underestimate
Samuel Taggart.

You'll do it only once.

You remember something?


But how do we know
this is the place?

I found it!

Well you found something.

Rather small for a
Captain's bounty.

Wait! I feel prying eyes.

Perhaps we should
seek a more private place.

Wait!

I'm going to go make
sure we are alone.

Don't touch it!

I'll return shortly.


That's for the fire.

I told you, you won't
have what's mine.

Leave it be lad.
Don't give me reason to really hurt you.

Ahhh!

What's this?

Not a lad at all, but a lass?

You're the daughter of the Captain.

You hid in the trunk.

Yes! And when
my father finds you,

he's going to skin you
like the skunk you are!

Not likely, that.

What other surprises
do you have for me?

Where's the boy?

Come now, where is he?

He's gone. Gone to get a rifle.

And then he's
coming back for you!

What does this mean?

I've no idea.

Don't play coy with me,
what does it signify?

It's my father's whistle.

I know that!

But why is it here?

It's a whistle! I've no
idea why it's here.

Except...

...It means that
my father was here.

Noooo!

I'll not be denied what's mine!

The Captain, plotted against me.

I'll not be lied to again.

Let's have it. What have
you done with the gold?

It's enough that you know,
that I'll do what I have to.

Now where's the gold?

Ahhh!

Is he dead?

Near enough.

We should have known
he would be watching.

You weren't ever
in any real danger.

You... left me here, for him to find.

Chris I'm sorry, but we
had to have the journal.

He would have killed
me while you watched.

It had to happen this way.

Don't touch it!

Sit!

Chris, you're being unreasonable.

Quiet! I'm thinking!


Well think quickly lass.

A little tighter maybe?

I'm a sailor's daughter.
I know how to tie a knot.

So is it Chris or Christine?

Didn't see any point in telling you.

Perhaps there wasn't.


Can you walk?

Well?

Nothing yet.

It truly is a journal,
though not of my father's.

What is this gold you search for?

Why ask me, you
know as well as I.

Remind me.

What addles your brain boy?

You've lost your memory.

But you remembered my name.

I remember small things.

Inconsequential things.

What happened to my father?

I fear we've failed him.

We promised to deliver you safely.

Eric...

...bring me my daughter.

I swear it!

Something comes to you?

Just a notion.

The Captain...

We can still make
good on our promise.

We can find the treasure
and return the girl

and the gold, back to
the good Captain.

You know where to find him?

He'll be waiting for our return.

You've trussed the wrong man!

Untie me and I'll help
you find the treasure.

I'll think on it.

I'll be watching...

...both of you.

He bears watching.

But we'll see if we can trust him.

But if not...

...do you have your shovel handy?

What am I looking for?

You'll know it when you find it.

I think I found it!

I wish you had that journal.

But I do.

You have the Captain's journal?

It's the only thing I still have
that belonged to my father.

Sam, the journal's in that box,
over there on my dresser.

Are you sure this is
the right journal?

There's nothing in here but
stuff about the Civil War.

It belonged to the
Captain's grandfather.

Go to the back of the book.

It's here!

Now all we have to do is
go back to the island

and follow the map!

C'mon, what are you waiting for?

Don't you think they've
tried that already?

We'll try again.

Perhaps I overlooked something.

Yeah like the fact that
there's nothing there.

So you planned to
leave without me?

You untied him?

Actually I untied myself.

I thought we could
use a good breakfast

before we go after the gold.

What have you
done with the journal?

I believe it's under your
bedroll where you put it.

Why didn't you wake me?

You looked tired.
I thought you could use the rest.

While you formed
your cozy partnership.

An alliance of sorts.

I don't trust him!

Nor I.

But we need him.

the Captain called
this his inheritance.

Southern gold, marked for the war.

Buried here by his grandfather
to keep out of Union hands.

The map was passed
down from father to son.

We know the Captain was here,
this has to be the right spot.

The sketch is clear,
we go through the window.

Perhaps digging will
jog your addled brain.

We need water.
I know.


Rose?

I thought we were going to put
our social calendar on hold?

Aren't you headed off to a picnic?

You know it's not a picnic.

Mr. Desmond, can I be frank?

Both: No!

Turner, I don't want to be rude,
but the ranch is not for sale.

Sam, why don't you and your
friend run outside and play.

You're putting your nose
where it don't belong.

I thought you said the climate
around here had changed?

It has.

Well it don't hardly seem like it.

It's gotten colder.
Yeah.

Respectfully Ma'am,
I think you could do a whole lot better.

Nobody's talking to you boy!

You know Sam, I think you're right.
The ranch isn't for sale.

Well who are you to be telling
me what's for sale and what isn't?

I'm a 50 percent owner,
that's who I am.

And I'm the other 50 percent.

What are you talking about?

That old delusional goat owns...

50 percent!

That's 150 percent.

And none of it's for sale.

You got 150 percent of nothing.

You know he's right.

I'm a patient man. I can wait.

But somebody is going
to own this place

and it may just as well be me.

I don't like being toyed with.

Yeah!

I hope you're proud of yourselves.

Cause there went our last chance.

There's the window!

That's got to be it.

So where do we dig?

You know, I'm not an experienced
treasure hunter, but...

I'm pretty sure that's
what the big X is for.

We're going about this all wrong.

Oh now this I've got to hear.

No serious, think about it.

Sam, this gold was
crucial to the war.

I mean, what makes you think that

they're going to draw
up some map

that's going to lead us right to it?

It doesn't make any sense.

It's like we are missing something.

So like, there's another map?

I don't know.


Where is everybody?
I can't get them to answer the door.

Maybe they just
don't want to talk to you.

What are you doing here?

Did you have a good day?

Because I did.


Henry what is he talking about?

Where's Rose and Christine?

You can talk to us!

I don't converse with children.

Are my ears on backwards?

Cause I only hear you
when you're going away.

Henry do you see the abuse I take?

Yep, I see it.

Why don't you go on out to the car.
I'll take care of this.

So what did he want?

Well if it goes like he plans.

You've only got 3 days to
come up with the money.

3 days as in 72 hours?

More like 46.

How does 3 days
equal up to 46 hours?

Well, it was 3 days this morning.
You've got until Friday at 6 P.M.

But today is shot...

Today shouldn't count!
We just found out!

Why should today count...
Sam...

It's not fair! If we had
the full 3 days...

Sam!
What?

What does it matter?

3 days, 3 years, we're never
going to find that money.

Can you take me to my father?

I'm sure he'll tell you where
the treasure is, and...

...then we won't have
to do all this digging.

I'll not return to the Captain
without his gold.

Did you leave a girl behind?

Of course not.

How can you be so sure?

I just think that's something
that I would remember.

Why would you remember that when you
remember so little?

Samuel, can you tell me
anything about my family?

You rarely spoke much
about your home.

Come now, I must
have said something.

Perhaps there was some
girl somewhere, pining away.

Yes.

There was one in Westbrook.

And one in Roxberry.

And another one in Abbot Village.


[More laughter]

What is it?

I'm not speaking to you.

These numbers...

...what do they mean?

Figures.

Something from the
war, I suppose.

That makes little sense.

The journal was written
in a different hand.

The map was obviously
added later.

These numbers are part of the map.
Not the journal.

That must mean something?

Yes. But what?

Something tickles my mind.
We used to play a game.

With my father's sextant.

We'd use it horizontally.

Not the way you
normally read a sextant.

The map shows us
where we begin.

The number is the
angle of the sextant arm.

Line it up.

Through the window.

And it tells you
what direction to go.

That'd give you the line of travel.

But we can't dig a
trench from here to the bay.

It could be anywhere
along that line.

It's just a game we played.

Well! I think the
Captain's daughter

has just solved the mystery.

An easy task for
someone not occupied

trying to remember which
girl he left in which town.

It's of little use.
We've no sextant.

Samuel, can you take
us back to the Captain?

It would seem I have
little choice in the matter.

How is she?

Sleeping.

Do you think we made her worse?

I don't know.

She says she's too old
to go to the hospital.

Sometimes when people
get stubborn...

...they die.

You're supposed to look
through the window.

I know, I know!

What's the reading?

Well the first number is 16.

16 degrees.

What do you see?

Hold on, give me a minute.

Something in that direction.

How far? How do we
know where to dig?

I don't know. Let me see the map.

What is that? Is that a 5?

It's a 55.

Or is it two separate 5's?

Maybe.

5 or 55?

Feet I guess?

Or maybe the number of steps?

Try them both!

One... two... three... four...

Five!

It's solid rock!

Maybe they have bigger feet.

We try 55.

19 hours...
we're down to 19 hours aren't we?

Something like that.

You didn't sell it to them did you?

No child, we're not going
to sell the Princess.

They'll have to take it from us!

Where will you go?

We've still got till
tomorrow afternoon.

Would you really
have married him?

Yeah, I guess I would.

You could come with us.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

We're just heading out to
the island one last time.

I'm glad I didn't miss you.
I intend to go with you.

Are you sure?
Don't you just want to stay here and rest?

Rest for what?

I have eternity to rest.

I have a hankering
to see the island again.

And you may be starting
at the wrong boulder.

And you may be senile.

And you're probably
on the wrong island.

How could I be on the
wrong island?

There's only one island.

He's gone!

What do you mean he's gone?

He's gone!

He is no longer here!
He's vanished!

Where would he go?

Eric!

Eric, tell me you have the journal!

You were sleeping on it.

I know. But I took it out
because it was too lumpy.

And the pistol?

Maybe he'll come back?

I very much doubt
we'll ever see him again.

I knew we never
should have trusted him.

We should have tied
him up again last night.

It wouldn't have made a difference.
He would have just untied it.

He played us for fools.

I know more than one knot.

Yeah, then why did you pick
one that is easily untied?

Because it hurts!

Well remind me never
to make you angry.

It's too late!

Eric!

It's still here.

It's still here!

You said that already.

I know what I said, it's just...

Why hasn't he left?

He could have abandoned us.

Chris.

Would the Captain have
carried a sextant in his chest?

It's possible.

But the chest was destroyed.

Samuel had the sextant all along.

There's nothing to stop him
from getting the gold.

Chris, we can't leave him!

Why?

The gold means nothing to me.

Eric, this is our chance.

He's occupied elsewhere,
we have the boat.

Let's go now, please!

Just you and me.

I thought you were
still angry with me.

I'll have plenty of time to
be angry at you later.

Let's just go!

Eric, don't leave me!

Ohhh!

Do you ever do as you're told?

I'm tired of being left behind.

Well you're left behind
for your own good.

It never seems to work
out that way.

Are you sure you want to be with a
man who has a girl in every village?

That's rubbish.

How do you know?

There aren't that many girls

that could possibly
stand to be around you.

So if our relationship
were to continue...

...can I always expect
you to be this stubborn?

Always.

And you'll obey me
in just such a manner

as you've done,
since I've known you?

In just such a manner.

And I can expect you to
follow me around incessantly

just as you have
these past days and nights?

I'll never leave your side.

And you desire such a relationship?

With all my heart.

But not yet.

I'm still far too angry at you!

How will we find him?

At least we know
where he has to begin.

We're running out of time.

I know!

We only have about 6 hours left...

...and it will take us an hour
to get back down to the boat.

You're not helping!

And it will take another two hours
to row back, and that...

Sam! Shut up!

Is this the place?

Yes.

But how do we know how far?

I mean, it's got to be one
of these last figures here.

5 something?

5 miles? 5 feet?

It was my Great-Grandfather's
final puzzle.

What happened to Taggart?
Isn't it possible that he found the gold?

We searched for him, thinking
that he might have left us

stranded on the island,
but he hadn't.

We came back here,
no wiser than before.

We had no sextant, and no journal.

Eric, what are we looking for?

Rocks.

There are rocks everywhere.

An easy area to defend if
someone should follow you.

An escape route to the water.

You toss it over the cliff
into a waiting boat.


[CONTINUED SCREAMS]

Eric!

I tried to tell you that I
would do what I have to.

But the greed keeps
bringing you back.

Samuel, I don't want the gold!

Just let me help her.

Stay put!

I feel for the girl.
But I didn't ask her to join us on this journey.

For that matter,
I didn't ask you either.

You would have been
better off with the Captain.

I swore an oath!

From which I release you.

The Captain can no
longer receive the girl.

I'm sorry lass, he died bravely.

You killed him.

He was already dead!

I simply finished
what others started.


Eric!


There is no pleasure in this.

I would have preferred
that you'd never joined us.

Eric!

Twice dead! How?


What do you want from me?

Why Samuel?

I don't have the money.

You're welcome to it.
Take it, take everything!

Why did you do it?

You can't hurt me!

You're an apparition!


Eric, help me!

I'm sorry. But you'll have
to do this by yourself.

I can't.

Chris.

Christine.

Do you trust me?

I want you to let go.

You mean for me to...

To die? No, it's not your time.

If you let go, you'll soon
find the water below.

I'll go for help.

How?

Now you must trust me.

Now let go!

Will you come back for me?

I shall fulfill my oath.

I will come back for you.

Now I must go.

Strength, little one.


So... you're saying
he was a ghost?

He swore an oath.

Do you believe in ghosts?

I believe in Christine.

Now what do we do?

We only have...
Shut up!

Wait!

Can I see your watch?

Five.

Five what?

The journal had two 5's,
the first one has to be...

Five o'clock. Dig at five o'clock.

But it's solid rock!

I know, but this has to be right.
I can feel it.

But the second 5.

Hold on to me.

What?

Just hold on to me.

What do you see?

The second 5.
It's got to be 5 feet down!

Did you bring some rope?

What is it? What do you see?

C'mon, we're running
out of time! Hurry!

I can't believe it! I can't believe it!

We did it! We did it!

We did it! We did it!

I don't believe it! I don't believe it!

We found it! Aunt Christine!

We found it!

It isn't gold, do you
think it's enough?

It's more than enough.

Oh, I am not one to deride much
pleasure from saying I told you so...

But, I told you so!

Ma'am, I've never been more
happy to be wrong in my life.

There's just one more thing.

I've decided to claim you after all.

Will you stay?

I'd like that.

Besides, I've got to stick
around to watch my 50 percent.

C'mon, we've got to get
back to the ranch.

C'mon Aunt Christine,
we've got to hurry.

It's so peaceful here.

C'mon, if we don't get this
money back to the hotel in time

It's no good to us.

I'm staying here.

We really don't have
time for this, c'mon.

It's okay, I have waited
my whole life for this.

Go! Go on, I'll be fine.

I'd just slow you down.

Okay, you stay here and just rest.

And we'll be back later, I promise.

Wait! The journal!

I don't want it left out here.

Come on, come on, come on!

We'll be back.

Did we make it? What time is it?

I don't know, I told you I
left my watch on the island.


Can someone please
tell me what time it is?

It's five-thirty.

What's he doing here?

I heard there was
going to be an auction.

I came out to see if maybe
you were selling anything.

Quit stalling Henry!
And let's get on with it.

You really have no claim until six.

Wait, what do you mean claim?

He's not the bank,
it's still got to go to auction.

Tell her Henry.

Not that it's the business of a child.

He bought the bank's interest.
He owns the note.

Can he do that?

Can and did! I own this place!

Not yet you don't!
Not until 6 o'clock.

And ain't nobody
doing nothing 'till then.

Eviction notice not withstanding.

And when you serve it,
it may take me days to get out.

And you'll go to jail!

I'll do nothing you tell me to do!

Nobody's going anywhere.

We found the money!

How much you got here?

Well, we haven't had a
chance to count it yet.

But...

What kind of money is this?

Just old stuff. Money's money.

They're Confederate bills.

The Captain called it
his inheritance.

But his grandfather hid it to keep
it away from some Union soldiers.

This stuff's no good!

You can't pay with
Confederate dollars.

This stuff hasn't been good
for over a hundred years!

What's he talking about?

He may be right.

Where'd you get this?

Aunt Christine, it belonged
to her father?

Jefferson Davis, President of
the Confederacy, is her father?

Jefferson who?

Why you so worried about the journal?
Is it worth something?

It could be worth
more than something.

If this journal can be
authenticated...

It could be worth...

Well it could easily go for...

How much?

Two... three hundred...
four hundred thousand... at auction.

In cash, I'll give you
two hundred and fifty.

If you're interested.

If we're interested?

Oh no you don't!
I need a check in my hand right now.

Henry... tell them they can't do this.

Authentication and a check.
How long is this going to take?

Well in view of the circumstances...

...I could rush things along.

I could get a check in 24 hours.

Hah! That's too late!

I need a check in
my hand within 5 minutes

or this place belongs to me!

Here you go sir, $175,000 dollars!

This check is no good!

Henry are you going to
let them get away with this?

Oh it will be good by the time
the bank opens on Monday morning.

Henry, do something!

Okay.

[Ripping paper]

I'll sue you. I'll sue every one
of you for every dollar you've got!

I'll sue every one of you!

Do you hear anything?
I feel a breeze, but I can't hear anything.

That's cuz our ears
are on backwards.

We only hear him when
he's walking away.

[Laughter and cheers]

C'mon, let's go get Aunt Christine!

Kids!

I'm sorry.

Your Aunt Christine died last night.

What do you mean?
She's out on the island.

She was fine when we left her.

Sam, Honey, don't do
this to yourself.

She had a good life.
And she's in a better place now.

Tell them. Tell them J. T!
Tell them she came with us.

Tell them!

She died sometime
during the night.

She's upstairs in her room,
if you want to say goodbye.

It's okay.

She gets what she wanted.

She finally gets to go home.

You certainly took your time.

I told you I would fulfill my oath.

Is that the only reason
you came back here?

Well isn't that reason enough?

Whoa, hey where are you going?

If the only reason you came
back was to fulfill some silly oath...

Is that all your mouth
can do is chatter?

Chatter?

I told you I'd come back for you.

Where are we going?

We're going home!

The Captain is expecting us.

Your mom has dinner waiting.

I'd waited a lifetime for love.

Some things are worth waiting for!

What do you think?

It's beautiful.

Except for one thing.

What do you mean,
except for one thing?

It's perfect!

Not quite.

What do you mean, not quite?

I'm telling you it's perfect!

If you say so.

I say so.

Except for one thing.

What?

You misspelled "Management."

I did not.

You did, you misspelled it.

Well if you're the genius,
why'd you let me do it?

I never said your lettering was bad,
I just said you couldn't spell.

Oh and I suppose
you could do better.

What, lettering or spelling?

It's not my fault you can't
make a good billboard.

I can make a good billboard.
It looks awesome!

Management, it's a simple word.
It's an "e" not an "a".

Managament, that's
what you spelled.

I mean people get the gist.

I mean seriously, it's not like they're
going to think it's something else.

It's not like you're stupid.

Did you go to school?

Because I'm pretty sure that's
the first word in the "M's"...

Well, I'm probably smarter
than you, anyway.

You're blond too.
