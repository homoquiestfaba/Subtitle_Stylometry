Lie next to me, Josh.

Come on, Manny.

Lie down.

It's peaceful here.

Yeah.

Kids, this isn't funny.

Sure it is.

How could you possibly
think this is funny?

Come on, Dad.

It's one of those things.

You know?

It's kind of funny.

Kind of sick.

Come on.

Isn't it funny?

Us lying next to our
dead big sister?

Like a family portrait?

And this is how you
pay respects?

Well, this is bullshit.

I'll be in the car.

You want to know what's
really bullshit?

The fact that we might
as well all be dead.

Was she all that mattered
to you, Dad?

Mom and Dad know you drink.

They can smell it on your
breath, you know?

Not that they care.

Are you gonna smoke weed?

Just remember all the brain
cells you're killing.

So how do I look?

Adorable.

Adorable?

Adorable.

Or not.

Hold on.

I gotta pee.

Sam.

Sam?

I wish you could come with me.

Samantha?

I've been looking
for you.

I gotta get out of here.

No.

Come on, Josh.

Please?

The guys here are
total losers.

Come dance with me.

Come on.

Fine.

Come on.

You're my brother.

Manny.

Hamlet and the gravedigger talk
about the brevity of life

and death as the great
equalizer.

And it's interesting that this
scene is so often cut from

productions, because it's
crucial to Hamlet's story.

Wouldn't you agree?

All right.

Now remember, in the beginning,
Hamlet is so afraid

of his father's ghost and the
prospect of his own death.

And now he's playing with
Yorick's skull.

That's kind of a quick
turnaround, don't you think?

He's beginning to accept death
as an inevitable part of life.

Now, the audience knows that
Ophelia's dead, which is an

example of?

Dramatic irony.

Dramatic irony.

Right.

Because Hamlet is unaware.

Now, there's also a lot of
mystery surrounding the cause

of Ophelia's death.

Gertrude describes it as an
accident, but the priest

argues that her death was
doubtful, and denies her full

burial rites by the church.

Now, why would they do that?

Any thoughts?

Yes?

Bathroom?

Fine.

Any other thoughts?

Anyone at all?

Amanda, you are so demented.

I am so out of here.

You coming?

I guess.

Why are we ditching
Mr. Evans' class?

He's so hot.

Come on.

I'll be your best friend.

You already are.

Katie, Katie, Katie.

I know.

Let's get some coffee.

Now.

Are your parents
gonna be home tonight?

No.

That's nice.

Cutie.

Take my picture.

Come on.

OK.

That's a good one, Sam.

Would you stop doing that?

It's creepy.

Ryan is the highest
boy at Stephens'.

And also the biggest
douche bag.

How do you even like Ryan?

Come on.

Ben likes him.

He just doesn't have a
very good reputation.

Why should you be the only
girl with a boyfriend?

You and Ben are legit
chained at the hip.

Ben and I aren't
the issue here.

Katie, I don't understand
where your problem is.

Whatever.

Your brother's a freak.

Hey, Katie.

Hey, Josh.

Afternoon, ladies.

Either I join, or you
guys are so busted.

Like Mom and Dad give a shit.

God, she looks just
like Samantha.

Smile, Manny.

Creep.

Yeah, that's classy.

Full of class.

That's me.

Yeah.

Ryan here.

Hey, Katie.

Why don't you kiss my brother?

Why?

Because I said so?

Get in there.

Is she a good kisser, Josh?

See for yourself.

Right.

Nice.

Nice.

You are such a typical guy.

Totally.

Come on.

I love you guys.

You can do it.

What?

What?

Do it.

Shut up.

What?

You are such a perv!

You're the perv.

Gross.

God.

Katie.

Why don't you just finish
what you started?

This is Mrs. Kildoff
from attendance.

Amanda left school early today,
and we need you to call

as soon as...

Morning, kids.

Good morning, Dad.

Good morning, Mr. Anderson.

I'll be late.

We should just start,
like, a little, like,

log of shit, right?

Just like, like a book with
like, every day we have like,

one solid idea.

Yeah.

So let's just start.

OK.

All right.

You can't make art without
starting, right?

No, not at all.

All right, let's just
fucking start.

Yeah, fucking
let's start, man.

OK.

All right.

Out loud, or write them down?

Out loud.

OK.

Who starts?

A store full of mannequins comes
alive after hours, and

they sing and dance.

Well, that sounds
like a musical.

No, no.

They'd be like mannequins
in the Korova Milk Bar.

Remember?

Singing and drinking
Milk Plus.

To sharpen you up.

Get you ready for a bit of
the old ultra violence.

Sounds big budget.

It's cool though, right?

Less than 10
minutes, right?

Yeah.

Go.

Yo, yo, hold on a sec, J!

Hey, they're throwing a
party for Mickey, and

Ryan wants me to come.

He so wants you.

Yes!

A son tells his parents he
wants a sex change operation.

OK.

Wait.

The the father is this, this
bull matron sort of macho

prick, and he's got no short
term memory, so the one has to

keep telling him
over and over.

Great Santini meets Memento?

Meets Brokeback Mountain.

Yo, that's dope, dude.

There's a party tonight.

Amanda says we should go.

Not me.

Yeah, you.

Josh, how are we gonna
collaborate next year with you

in LA and me stuck
here in the city?

Dude.

We write all year and
shoot in the summer.

It's simple.

We said we'd go to
the same school.

Did I ask you to
get rejected?

Where's your pot?

In the closet.

It's gonna get pretty boring
if you keep it on me.

Well, maybe
tonight you'll finally get

some, and I'm gonna
document it.

Yeah.

Loser gets lucky.

Nice.

High concept.

Give it to me.

I wanna shoot.

Why?

Give it to me.

No.

No.

Fuck you, then.

All right.

Dude, come on.

You can do it!

I will be the star.

Welcome to the lifestyles of
the rich and obnoxious.

Join us as we experience
their champagne

wishes and cocaine dreams.

Yo, dude.

Get some of this.

Come on.

Josh.

Ryan's barely even
said hi to me.

Well at least I guess Tom
got in your throat first thing

we got here.

Dance with Seth.

Make him jealous.

Hi, Seth.

Didn't wear my dancing
shoes tonight, Manny.

Hi, Seth.

Hey, Katie.

Where's Ben?

In the bathroom.

With Ryan.

What are you implying?

Hey, yo!

Yo, everybody!

Everyone, listen up!

Listen... listen up.

Where's Mickey?

Where's Mickey?

Come on.

What do you give
a guy that has

everything on his 18th birthday?

What?

I don't know!

What do you give him?

That's the question.

The answer is you don't.

You don't get anything.

With a guy like Mickey, the
best thing to do is to take

something away.

That was a thing he should
have lost a long time ago.

His virginity!

Ladies and gentleman, allow
me to introduce to you the

very beautiful Roxanne!

I hate him!

What happened?

My god, Manny,
what happened?

He totally ditched me.

Forget about him.

Josh, it was so embarrassing.

Manny...

Help me.

What's going on?

Hey, Sam.

Is Amanda OK?

I don't know.

Maybe you could help.

She doesn't talk to me.

You're a good brother, Josh.

What are you doing?

Filming.

Why?

Because.

Josh!

I'm so happy!

I'm so happy!

We're done!

I guess you guys passed
your chem final?

Three whole months without
this fucking skirt.

Yeah.

So when are you guys done?

Well, Brainiac here got the
senior exemption on the math

final.

I gotta be good at something.

I'm taking it tomorrow.

And then graduation.

Nice.

Yeah!

Next week.

Yeah!

Yes!

Hey, have you guys
seen Ben, or...

There he is.

I gotta go.

Bye, guys.

Amanda, come.

No, that's OK.

You go.

Hey, Seth?

Can I bum a cigarette?

Hey, you guys
wanna get some coffee?

We're going to Star-bizzle.

Wanna come?

Well?

Bye, guys.

Bye, guys.

What?

My god, look at Allie.

What a slut.

Who does this?

I mean, are you really gonna
want your grandkids to see you

looking like that?

You're looking good here.

Very much the stud.

Aren't you gonna sign it?

I only sign for people I'm
never going to see again.

What did she write?

Some crap about how we've both
had hard times, and she

understands.

Blah, blah, blah.

I think I might tear
out the page.

She's just trying to be nice.

Yeah, well she doesn't know
what it's like for me.

It's just like I don't
know her shit. it's

dishonest, you know?

Got any weed?

A horse, a horse!

My kingdom for a horse!

Greatest line in the
history of theater.

We can visit each other
in college, for sure.

If you want me to.

Of course I do.

Idiot.

I have to tell you something.

Josh...

That's a scary way to
start a conversation.

So?

Promise you won't hate me?

Dude, what could be so awful?

Are you gay, or something?

What if I was?

Fuck.

Why didn't you tell me?

What, I'm the last one
to know, right?

No!

My best friend's a faggot, and
I'm the last one to know.

Do I look gay?

Are we talking Elton John,
or Tom Cruise gay?

I'm not gay, Sam.

I know.

But if you were, I'd
still love you.

Check it.

This is what got me
into film school.

Josh, it's incredible.

She's so beautiful.

Does
she speak to you?

No.

It's my fault.

I never paid much attention
to her.

Stop.

Hey.

Can I come in?

What's the matter?

Do me a favor?

Tel me everything you
know about Ryan.

I want to know who he
hangs out with.

You know, everything.

Ryan and I only have
one thing in common.

You.

Stop.

Why do you want him so bad?

Everyone wants him.

And so that's why
you want him?

Yeah.

It's more like I need him.

He's a dick, Amanda.

I'm not gonna say it again.

He's trouble.

I know it.

I have this dream where I'm
in my room at night.

And all these guys start coming
in, one by one, and

they fuck me.

All of them.

At the same time.

And I like it.

So, I guess I just
like trouble.

Come on.

Wouldn't you want to
get that on tape?

I saw you.

Through the door.

I should have had my camera.

Seth!

Hey man, what's up?

What's up?

How have you been, dude?

I've been waiting here
for like, days.

We did the whole family
celebratory lunch thing.

Good.

Yeah, it's all good.

They're giving me a bangin'
Mac Pro with Final Cut.

With an HD monitor?

30 inch.

That's dope.

That's tight.

I'm an asshole, man.

Stupid fuck.

I'm sorry.

It's OK.

I'm the asshole.

Dropping that on
you like that.

Yeah, well, it freaked
me out.

But I, I shouldn't have
reacted that way.

I'm sorry.

It's really... it's no
big deal, anyway.

Let's forget about the
whole thing, OK?

I'm fine.

Thanks for understanding,
man.

Do your parents know?

My mom.

She says she always knew.

I always knew.

It's a relief to finally
admit it.

That must have been a
heavy load to carry.

Yeah.

From you, especially.

My dad, too.

I think his reaction's gonna
make yours look calm.

The macho fuck.

I'm sorry.

It's OK.

So nobody else knows?

Not really.

Not really?

Well, there's this,
sophomore, Harry.

Harry the Fairy?

Don't say that.

You weren't really tutoring
him, were you?

I taught him a lot.

You're fucking Harry?

Some fucking, yeah,
but mostly sucking.

Dude, come on.

Spare me the details.

No.

I will not spare you
the details.

I've had to listen to pussy
this, and pussy that, and look

at that rack since forever.

If we're going to be friends,
you're going to have to listen

to me, too.

You were worse than me.

I was faking it.

Well, just so you know,
I cannot fake any

cock talk, all right?

Someone else knows.

Who?

Your, your sister,
Amanda.

We were at Matt's
party last year.

She made a pass at me.

I told her then.

My god.

You really are gay,
aren't you?

I mean, everybody wants
to fuck my sister.

I forgot my key.

Where have you been?

You knew I'd be late.

Fuck you.

You're drunk, Susan.

Fuck you.

This is a $300 shirt.

You sicken me.

Who is she?

Who is she?

Who are you fucking?

Your cell phone called home,
and I've got 20 minutes of

your good times recorded on
this answering machine.

Do you want to hear it?

I mean, we
were walking along outside.

If you had been there...

Put the paper down.

We're not done yet.

Put the booze down.

You're dangerous when
you're drunk.

Which seems to be all the
time now, doesn't it?

Who do you think you are?

An angry drunk.

That's the worst kind.

Don't.

I am warning you, do not
ever hit me again.

Who is she?

No one.

Big deal.

I went out for drinks
after work.

Bullshit.

Who is she?

Why do you care?

You admit it.

No.

Why would you care if I am?

Fuck you.

Yeah.

I doubt it.

You think you cornered the
market on suffering?

You think that maybe for once
you could understand that my

life ended six years ago?

Have you ever thought about
anyone but yourself since?

We lost you, too.

I loved her.

We all loved her.

She killed me, too.

She's...

Our daughter's getting
married this weekend.

Marla's very happy, but,
I hope she knows

what she's in for.

Kids?

Who's in there?

Hello?

Hell...

My god.

My god!

Susan!

Samantha!

No!

No, no, no!

No!

No!

Samantha!

Do you remember when, Mom
and Dad went out to the,

the Broadway show,
the matinee?

And we got all naked and used
Mom's makeup to paint our

whole bodies?

I was a robot.

And I was a tattoo lady.

You got blamed, even though
I thought of it?

What are big sisters for?

You used to run into my
bed every time you

had a little nightmare.

You are my Joshy-poo.

Why did you do it, Sam?

The shrinks say I should
be mad at you.

You can be mad if it helps.

What are you doing?

Nothing.

Waiting up for me?

Do you need me to help
you pack for college?

No.

I got time.

I'm hardly bringing
anything, anyway.

Just the suitcase
and my backpack.

That's it.

What more do I need?

Just me!

I'm definitely coming
with you.

You can't leave me here alone.

You've got Ryan.

You know what I mean.

And you can't leave me
here alone with them.

Is he hurting you?

Don't be such a pussy, Josh.

I like it rough.

It's gonna be fine.

I worry a little.

Can I sleep in here
with you tonight?

Sure.

OK, but let's go to sleep,
because I am really exhausted.

OK.

Could you get the
light, please?

Thank you.

Can you not steal all
the covers tonight?

I can make no promises
in that regard.

You're a cover monster.

Cover monster.

Joshy-washy.

Manny-Danny.

Yay.

Morning.

Hi.

Remember, we're having
dinner with the

Brahams tonight at 7:30.

You want me to send
a car for you?

That would be nice.

All righty.

Have a good day.

I warned you about
Ryan, Manny.

See...

it's nothing I can't handle.

But what if you can't?

I can.

Yeah, but what if you can't?

I'd kill myself if anything
ever happened to you.

It's weird.

When things get messed up
sometimes I say to myself,

what would Sammy do?

She would slit her wrists.

Quiet.

Neatly, of course.

No mess for anyone
to clean up.

Shut up Manny.

Just drop the body
off at the morgue.

Get on with your life.

Stop it.

What a great role model,
your big sister.

Get out of my room.

You know what?

Face it, Josh.

You're never going
t a filmmaker.

You're gonna cave like
everyone else.

You'll go to business school
and get a job you hate.

You'll marry a woman you'll
grow to hate.

And have kids, because that's
what people do.

You're gonna get fat,
go bald, and die

wondering what the fuck?

And then I'm just gonna marry
someone who doesn't even

understand me.

But I mean, at least he'll buy
me lots of expensive things,

and keep me in booze and pills,
and in a couple of

years, I'll probably pop out
a couple kids and start the

whole fucking thing
over again.

You know what?

Actually, I take it back.

Maybe she had the right idea.

Why should we even bother?

How could she do this?

Mom's an alcoholic, Josh.

Alcoholics drink too much.

What happened?

She tore the house up.

You know how she gets.

But do they know
their father?

Do they know their father is
screwing Karen in the European

Equities division?

Susan.

After Samantha, he promised
me he'd stop

screwing his secretary.

After all, she's the one
who caught them.

She is out of her mind.

Is that true?

Your father is a man of
his word, my dear.

He dumped Sharon.

But he's been fucking
Karen ever since.

First Sharon, then Karen.

It rhymes.

Who's next, Mark?

You did that in
front of Sammy?

Where are you going?

Hey.

Dad.

No, no no.

Get out of my way, Josh.

Sorry.

Dad!

Dad!

Fuck you, OK?

Fuck you man!

You're a fucking disgrace!

How could you fucking
do this to us?

Dad!

Come on, man.

Please just talk to me.

Please.

Yo, Seth.

Is there any way we
could hang out?

Cool.

No, actually.

I'm right downstairs.

Yeah.

OK.

All right man.

Yo, check me out!

I'm Ryan.

My god.

Wait, dude.

This is good.

This is good but you forgot
one thing here.

It's the face.

Yeah!

He does do that face!

No!

And you know when he
does it like, when

nobody's there, right?

And he's all...

He knows everybody's watching.

Yo you've got it, dude.

And the pants are out.

Yeah.

Survey the crowd.

Yeah.

Just check out...

Stop!

Yo, you got anymore?

No.

No more alcohol for you.

But I've been saving
something for a rainy day.

One for me.

And one for thee.

Rakim is the best for
the simple reason

that he was the first.

I mean, to combine syllables,
patterns, and, and technical

construction, all, all with
a panoramic third eye?

Come on.

I mean, he was the first.

All these other guys, they rap
on the premise that Rakim

originated.

You know what I'm saying?

Like, like he, he created from,
from a blank canvas

while these other guys, they
just took the baton from there

and continued on.

So to say that someone is
better, just, you know...

Dude, shut up.

You're white.

That's racist.

Hostility over here.

I mean, a lot of people would
say, a lot of people, a lot of

people would say,
but he was a one syllable man.

Another great rapper
was Cool-G guy.

Yeah.

Who, heavily...

Pardon the pun, heavily built
up Big Pun's success.

Hold on.

The bastard's got my stash.

No.

Come on.

We don't need it.

Besides, I, I got something
better, anyway.

Yeah, come on.

What?

So...

I was...

With my, Mom and Dad.

Did you know my Mom...

Did you know she was
in the hospital?

Alcohol poisoning.

And my dad, man.

He's cheating on her.

I know.

I didn't know.

And so we found out they're
just fucked up.

So I like, tried
to talk to hi.

On the street.

You know, he just didn't...

He didn't want to talk to me.

So he just got in a cab,
and sailed away.

He'll come back.

Naw.

I doubt it.

Anyway, he wouldn't need to.

We've got Mom to take
care of us.

When she's not slipping
off into a coma.

Not funny, Josh.

Yeah, I know.

Anyway, who cares about me?

I'm leaving next week.

It's Manny you've got
to worry about.

I'll keep my eye on her.

Thanks, man.

I would do anything for you.

You know that, right?

Yeah.

Just remember, she
likes to dance.

This shit.

I'm sorry, man.

I'm scared I really fucked up.

Squeeze.

Harder.

Harder!

Come on.

Harder!

Come on!

Wait, that hurts!

Come on!

You're hurting me.

I'm not gonna hurt you.

Wait, you are hurting me.

No!

What's up?

You look horrible.

You were right.

Am I hurting you?

No.

Good.

I'll kill him if you want.

What are we gonna do?

It's gonna be OK.

But you're leaving.

It's just too weird.

Maybe I won't go.

No.

No, you're going.

Or I'll kill you.

And you're gonna meet a
nice girl in college.

I love you, Joshy.

I love you too, Manny.

No.

You can have what's
left of me.

No.

No.

Stop.

I hate you!

I hate you!

I hate you!

I hate you!

I hate you!

I hate you!

The way I mean

I've got everything
packed up.

Erase it.

Why?

Erase everything.

The pictures, the videos.

Everything about me.

Don't save a thing, Josh.

It's too...

Just please, erase everything.

All right.

Thanks.

It's better that way.

I don't know if I can find the
words, the right words, to

let you know how sorry I am.

But I want you to know that
if you want, I want to

be there for you.

Fuck.

Hey.

So, this is about
my 10th take.

Everything I said sounds so
trite, I-I don't, I don't

think I'm ever gonna
get this right.

Manny?

Manny?

Hey.

Hey.

They're sending Mom
home tomorrow.

She wants us to pick her up.

What about her husband?

He's gone.

He's not coming back, either.

You know that.

And I'm leaving for
LA on Wednesday.

Yeah, well Mom and I can
hold down the fort.

I've got to get
of here, Manny.

Am I asking you to stay?

Two more years,
and you're out.

It's like I'm doing time.

Except you haven't done
anything wrong.

No?

Go.

I wasn't gonna...

Go.

Get out.

Manny...

Get out of my room.

Why are you do...

Get out of my room!

I was just trying to...

Get out of this state!

Get out of my life!

Yeah.

It's right here, please.

Hi.

Can you give this to Seth
when you see him?

Thanks.

Josh!

Off you go.

Yeah.

It's gonna be hell around
here without you.

It was hell around
here with me.

Guess I should go.

Yeah.

Bye, Joshy.

Family weekend's
in October, OK?

You'd better come.

Bye, Manny-fanny.

Bye, Joshy-washy.

Hold on a second.

OK, I'm ready.
