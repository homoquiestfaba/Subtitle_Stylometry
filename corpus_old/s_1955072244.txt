is based in symbiosis.

Givers and takers.

God gave us life but then
he took it away with death.

But now God doesn't exist anymore so...

someone's gotta step up to the plate.

(woman sighs)

Come on, it'll be fun.

Nope.

Sounds like the plot of a lame movie.

"What happens when a guy names
Ned takes a hooker named Love

"home to meet the parents?

"This Thanksgiving the turkey ain't all

"that's getting stuffed."

You're not a hooker.

And strippers are really dancers.

By now my family probably thinks I'm gay.

Well them thinking it doesn't
put a cock in your ass now,

does it?

No it doesn't.

But you gotta admit, we're
getting pretty serious.

You're just a regular.

You don't charge me.

I don't charge you
because you pay me anyway.

Love, I love you.

And I you, like a brother.

Like a brother than I fuck.

You know I'm only joking right?

I know.

That's what I love about you.

I wanna joke with you every day like this.

All right, I know enough
about how I feel about you,

to know that this is it.

(Love sighs)

It's what I now about
me that counts though.

I've got to feel worth it.


(ominous music) (choking)

You beg for life.

"Let me live! Let me live!"

But day by day you feed on distraction.

Prove me wrong.

Life is not just existence.

Which is more important?

How we got here?

What we're doing here?

Or where we go when we leave?

How'd you get here?

(dark rockabilly music)

You've been a naughty
little prince, haven't you?

Yes you have.

Knocked over Daddy's little Colt.

Look at her.

Look at her, cleaning your naughty.

This isn't doing any
good. It's all soaked in.

Oh, we're surrounded by quitters today.

Mm, there she is. There's my girl.

Ready to party?

Yeah, Sonny can I talk to you?


Can we talk alone?

Why? She won't say nothing.

Not too bright.

Fine.

I made up my mind.

I'm ready to move on.

Move on?

The next level?

So, drugs? Do hits? Fucking donkey shows?


What you got in mind?

I don't wanna work anymore.

Please, I got enough lazy bitches to feed.

I'm quiting.

No more parties.

No, you're going out tonight.

Don't set up a gig and
got to come through one.

New girl's going with ya.

You're not getting me to work with kids.

Not Tabby. I'm just baby sitting.

Besides, silly bitch done give everything

away for free anyway.

Look, I'm telling you I quit.

Women...

I knew I should have invested in trannies.

Sit down!

Floor's full of bugs and Fritos.

And you'll eat off it if I tell you to.

Not likely.

You knew from day one you wouldn't

be able to walk away from this.

Made it all clear.

You're in, you're in.

Nothing lasts forever.

I could twist your fucking head right now.

You seen it all.

Loose ends ain't how business works.

Things are different for me.

You know if you let me go I'm down.

I won't say shit to anyone.

I've earned my pass.

You leave me hanging and
I'll leave you hanging

by your neck.

Now, you got a party to go to.

One job, it's the last
one and then I'm out.

Whatever you say.

I'm serious.


Be sure to spread them extra wide tonight.

Take in as much as possible.

Where am I going?

Poot's getting the other girls.

They'll pick ya up.

(rock music)

Love!

You look lovely!

Poot, you're looking like a grown man

that likes to be called Poot.

Hey, meet the girls.

This is Halley, like the comet.

And this is Jenna.

All right, well why don't
you guys get acquainted,

I am gonna smoke a J
and we'll be on the way.

Why don't we just leave?

Got plenty of time.

I figure they're gonna have you ladies do

one of those
cheek-to-cheek dildo things.

You know, I figure you might
wanna feel each other up or,

oops did I say that?

I meant feel each other out.

What's a cheek to cheek?

It's like A Requiem for a Dream.

I don't know what the shit you just said.

It's a gross movie.

Scared me.

See, we know each other.

Hailey's the movie critic and Jenna...

The actress.

You may have seen me on MySpace,

like a thousand-hundred friends.

Can we just get this
thing over and done with?

Damn girl, you horny or what?

Very or what.

All right!

Cram in, we'll roll.

Oh, sexy leprechaun.

"They're always after me Lucky Charms!"

It's the vacation home.

Anytime is perfect.

I'm putting the keys in the box right now.

You should bring your clients by tomorrow.

Well next week then.

Sell it for me Ricky.

I've got a 900 channel cable bill to pay.

(ominous music)

Excuse me, are you...

I didn't see another car in the driveway.

Were you looking at the house?


(peaceful music)


I just don't wanna bug you.

you'll be the first to know.

All right, I just don't wanna smother you.

You know, people like people
and the next thing you know

the word stalker's being thrown around.

Sounds like you have a past
I'm needing to know about?


when the girls said jump he'd jump.

Right off a cliff.

I've got one last thing to do tonight

and then we'll talk, okay?

What do you want to talk about?

Our world.

Okay, what time are you picking us back up?

need-to-know basis.

Figures.

with evil shit all day long.

He doesn't have time for me to bug him

with every last detail.

Yeah, well I'm glad our
well-being is a little detail.

come get you right now?

People need to know
they can save themselves

before they let others protect them.

All right, well whatever it is you

have to prove or do I respect that

but I'd rather you drop it
and come hang out with me.

There are many things
I wanna say to you, Ned.

Wonderful happy things but
they're not for the phone

and they're definitely not for right now.

you need me I'll be there

in a flash.


I love you.

And you're the only
person I make promises to.

(tense music)

You could have made different
choices, do you agree?

No, you don't.

You are just a dumb-eyed, drooling victim.

People don't plan to
die but when they do they

just lie down for it.

People don't have freedom of choice.

Only choice you can make
depends upon your options.

So outside influences direct the outcome.

People don't have the power of free will...

but they do have the power to direct

the free will of others.

Ripples.

Ripples...

in a pond of chaos.

Take it.

Take it.

Now...

what are you doing here?

(ominous music)

What are your names?

Jenna.

Halley.

Scarlet.

Your real names.

Sasha.

Angel.

Barbara.

They've had some training.

Sucks when you have to do rentals.

Should look into
rent-to-own, baby.

I'm Cleb!

(Jenna giggles)

I'm Mistress Selma.

So, the ice is broken...

and we've all fallen through.

Well let's warm things up then.

Well my name's Hate.

Is that warm enough for you?

(Selma giggles)

So, you're successful.

Mm-hm.

Good looking.

Yeah.

Why escorts?

Just you.

Escort, no plural.

I don't know, girls, I don't
wanna say they're needy,

but wanty.

As opposed to guys?

Well I only swing one way
so it's a one-sided view.

So look, a lot of women are smart enough

to get what they need but they make men

bend over backwards for
stupid shit they want like,

cars and clothes.

Well, women are more materialistic.

You know, no picking
flowers, just store-bought?

That and talking on cell phones 24/7.

Oh and they meet a guy
who's a wannabe rocker,

plays a little guitar, they're gone.

Okay, so does it bother
you when girls say that

most of her friends are men?

Oh, yeah that's who
they're talking to right?

I mean anyone that's serious about someone,

if you're spending more
time with another boy

they're gonna get mad.

I mean, it's not jealousy
it's just common sense.

And these are all younger women, right?

Come on, don't be coy.

Men mature a lot slower than women.

It's that whole dawn of the manchild thing.

Well women fuck you
over when they're younger

because when you get older
you're gonna fuck them over.

I know where you're going
with this and it's bullshit.

[Love] Do you?
[Ned] Yeah.

Women put most the pressure on themselves.

I mean, walking around all annoying,

"I'm fat, oh I need Botox."

Oh, come on!

Bullshit!

The moment a girl doesn't
look like a bikini model

the man starts chasing tail.

Take your average woman
and your poor sap guy

and when they get older he is going to dump

her ass to fuck escorts.

I know.

Well if they've been together
long enough he probably

won't have enough money to fuck escorts.

(Love laughs)

Oh, you've just been burnt by some bitches.

Don't lump us all into one.

Are we fighting?

I was thinking I was gonna
hit you with this pillow.

No, I think that I am going to

tiger shuck your arm, (Love giggling)

pull it down here and tickle you to death.

Oh, I think you'll regret that.

Okay, oh mercy! Mercy, mercy.

See, you peed a little bit.

Shut up.

Seriously though.

What?

If that's what bothers you
about girls, why escorts?

Just you.

I figured I'd know what
I was getting myself into

beforehand with you.

Now what do you think?

I think you're worth
learning to play guitar for?

Banjo?

Stick to flower picking.

Dandelions, they'd be my favorite.

Is your name really Hate?

Well, my parents didn't get along so well.

I think it's a sexy name.

Bit dramatic.

Or simple.

I'm a simple guy.

My name's short for Clebidiah.

That's unique.

I thought we were gonna party.

Yeah my hosting skills are a bit rusty.

We're not "people" people.

Okay.

I'm gonna get drinks.

Is there any booze in this house?

No, sit back down.

Cleb will get it.

Cleb.

So, what do you guys do?

Ordering a three-girl takeout
must be a special occasion.

We are actors.

(Selma and Jenna laughing)

Yeah, we're in a play. Rave reviews.

Anything I've heard of?

Three Mad Mice.

Do you have a MySpace?


Film is not my medium of choice.

I suppose the art has its value.

I prefer to use my mind.

I bet there's a lot of dirty
things going on up there.

Can you explain that?

What you just said about your mind.

Use my mind as a projector.

To put Hate out into the world.


First call for alcohol!

Thank you.

"And that," said the
snail "is the slick of it."

(girls laughing) Get it, huh?

Slick of it.

That's dumb.

Bless the power of beer
to bring us all together.

One beer to rule them all.

Yeah but what kind of party
can you have with a 24-pack?

Have mine.

Haven't touched it.

Thank you.

Mm, I guess now we see who's all more

bearable as a drunk.

I can't even get a buzz
off six beers, come on.

There's mutual desires in compatibility.

Not the beer.

On a basic human level the beer brings out

our compatibility.

I doubt anyone has the
same desires as Cleb.

You all laughed at the stupid snail joke.

It's lack of humor should indicate to you

our mutual desire to get along

regardless of motivation.

Beer makes us laugh at
all sorts of stupid things.

You weren't drinking.

You weren't laughing.

In this scenario,

this basic human level you speak of,

it's Tab A into Slot B for money.

We all signed on without a drink.

I don't know what the fuck
y'all are talking about.

Does somebody have another joke?

Yeah, tell us a joke.

I don't usually carry any around, sorry.

You got one or two.

Nothing intellectual enough
for you I don't think.

Cleb and I probably memorized
the same books as kids.

Boy, I bet you can hold your own.

You're not as simple as you said you were.

I just like to keep my eyes open.

Now tell us a joke.

Make it a funny one.

Okay.

Two snowmen are walking in a meadow.

The first snowman says
to the second snowman,

"Do you smell carrots?"

(Hate and Love giggle)


Snowmen can't walk.

Snails can't talk either.

All living creatures use
some means of communication.

Just becuase we can't understand them

doesn't mean snails can't talk.

Whereas snowmen are
innanimate lifeless entities.


Every retard has its moment I guess.

See, they don't get along.

Oh, they know each other
so that doesn't count.

Ah, so it's all healthy?

We've bonded.

Right.

Yeah, I think it's time
we divided up and got down

to business.


I would appreciate it
if you were to accompany

me this evening.

Hey, I've been batting
eylashes at you all night.

You'll have fun with Cleb.

One-on-one
time!

We're not playing love connection.

You gotta play it to win it.

I paid for all the prizes.

Then I guess you want the best.

Barbara here intrigues me.

Barbara's not her real name.

It's all part of the adventure.

You don't know my name.

Oh I knew you the second
I laid eyes on you.

You want power and money.

I know it ain't 'cause of my pretty mug.

I like your ears.

If you want anything you
will rock Cleb's world.

I need him crazy happy.


Wait till you see him crazy happy.

What time should I pick 'em up?

Eh, leave 'em.

Love's copped an attitude.
Let her find her own way home.

Sometimes think I'll just
kill everybody and start over.

Nobody dependable anymore.

Might as well rotate through strangers

just bump off those
that don't make the cut.

I'd say no to that.

Hm, too much killing bad for business.

You can't retire from this business.

In it 'till you die.

Or until you die.

More reason to kill everybody first.



Oh, just right.

This is for the couch because my skin

gets sticky and will stick to the leather.

Oh god.

I better stretch.

I brought you something.

As long as it's not heroine.

I promised my sponsor.

I'm into role playing.


and I'm your cheerleader?

Not quite the plan.

Go in the bathroom and put that on.

While you're in there go ahead
and lose the bitch attitude.

I want you sweet.

Ah, ah, ah, time is money.

Come on it's gonna be fun!

So what do you think?

My ears I mean.

As you 90's kids might say,

"All that and a bag of Doritos."

They suit you.

Strong character.

Nice wingspan.

Not sure you look part
of the family though.

We're all God's children.

From time to time.

Well what about me?

Am I cheese and crackers?

You?

You are the cats meow.

(Love chuckles)

You can sit on the bed.

Should I relax or get sexy?

Well you could try tense
and ugly if you'd like,

but I doubt you got the talent.

Hm, sounds like a compliment.

And a challenge.

(random noises)

Ha! Ready to bump this?

(dark ambient music)

Dance for me.

Dance like your life depends on it.


Oh yeah, that's it.

Uh-huh, mm.

Stop.

No.

Like this.


That's it.

Get on the bed.

Say, "Yes Mistress."

Yes, Mistress.

Lick my toes.

Yes, Mistress.

That's it.

Really get 'em good.

Yes, Mistress.

Get into it.

Really get the soles clean.

Oh yeah.

Mm-hm, ah.


Come here.

(Halley laughing)

Command me, Madam.

Suck my toes.

But I already did.

Please, no more.

Yes, more.

Smell 'em, slave.

Tell me your name.

A stranger will still be a stranger

by any other name.

I want to know.

Mm, you want to know Barbara.

Behave and Barbara might let you.

See now there you go.

Just like your friend thinking
you got some kind of control.

You're bought and paid for.

Do you debate everything?

We can sit here all night, chat.

Cool with me.

Your intelligence suits you.

Why, strong character.

Nice wingspan.

Okay old man.

(Hate chuckles)

What you refuse to
comprehend is a need for girls

like my friend and I to
remain separate from the girls

you paid for.

Oh, comprehension's got
nothing to do with it.

Oh?

I've just been around long enough

to know better is all.

Really?


Come on.

Are you the same guy that orders hookers or

are you better than that guy?

I'm looking for someone special.

Mm, has it been a long search?

It's been ripe.

Let's dance.

You don't need to woo
what's already been bought.

Get up.

Dance with me?

(Love gasps)

But there isn't any music.

There's always music.

You just gotta listen for it.

Put your quarter in the juke.

Circus music. (jaunty music)

How fitting.

Yeah.


(grunting and chuckling)

Now tell me your name.

(Love pants)

Yeah?

Barbara Givens.

(tense music)

Look at me.

Now I want to take you by force...

but I need you to want me to.

I don't go from normal to
psycho in just three seconds.

One, two, three.

(Hate grunting) (Love panting)

Tell me your name.

Give me your name.

I will take it.

I will take it!

Tell me your name!

Love.

What?

Love.

What?

Love, you asshole.

This is the perfect circle.

I knew I would find you.

Thank you. Harder.


Thank you. Harder.


Thank you. Harder.


Thank you. Softer.


You take it and you like it, slave.

(Selma moaning)

Oh, you are very promising.

Now we take it to the next level.

So what, are you gonna
be a pain in the ass too?

Like the sequel.

What?

"Pain in the Ass Part Two: Mo' Ass"

You're a crackhead.

Look, I might be new to
the game but I can play,

and I need the money
so I can, I don't know,

afford stuff that I might need to afford.

Bigger tits.

I mean, I can't club and fuck forever.

Hey by all means keep getting 'em bigger

no matter how old.

Be one of them freakshow grannies.

People pay.

Mm, no thank you.

I'm gonna find another way to spend my life

or I don't know, maybe it'll find me.

Look, I don't do sports.

Don't worry about that.

I wanna watch you suck this off.

Use both hands.

Both hands.

That's it.

Careful, don't chip a tooth.

Ow!

What the hell was that?

Just a little something.

That's it.

It'll feel good in a
minute just take it all in.

I'm ready for the big game.

I'll do whatever you want.

But call me a bitch again
and we're playing Bobbitt.

I make the stories.

I own the playground.

Recess is in session.

Give me a D.

Give me an A.

Lay down.


So if I'm the cheerleader,

are you my studly football player?

I like dinosuars.

(ominous music) (growling)

Okay stop, you're scaring me.

(Cleb growling)

Stop.


(Halley moaning)

Oh, you sick whore!

(Halley choking)


Oh, fucking hell.

Must have been allergic.

(Cleb growling) (dramatic music)

(microwave beeping)

(ominous music)

Ah, just right.

Oh you like that, don't you?

Oh, you're so ripe.

Oh yeah.

Oh baby.


Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Huh? Huh? Huh?


Yeah, uh you like that don't you?

Yeah? Yeah? Oh yeah?

Yeah? Yeah?


Oh, you're so juicy. (squelching)

Yeah.

Oh.


(tense music) (grunting and moaning)


Don't stop.

Don't stop.

Does that feel good?

(Selma scoffs)

Will you look at this mess you've made?

Fuck.

Fuck.

(ominous music)

Cleb, this isn't a peep show.

Who's there?

(chaotic music)

Don't chip a tooth, bitch.

(ominous music)

You're having trouble making
up your mind, aren't ya?

Well that's because you're
weighing the consequences.

But are you thinking about the consequences

of weighing those consequences?

You can only stall until your last breath.

(phone buzzing)

Tick, tick, tick, tick.

Tick, tick, tick, tick.

Tick, tick, tick, tick.

Tick, tick, tick, tick.

Tick, tick, tick, tick.

Tick, tick, tick, tick.

Ding!

(electronic pop music)

â™ª I like it sexy, like
it hot, like it sweaty â™ª

â™ª Like it rough on top â™ª

â™ª I'm on top, I'm on top â™ª

â™ª I like 'em strong, like
him firm, like him close â™ª

â™ª Like him sure on me â™ª

â™ª It's what I need, what I need â™ª

â™ª And I got to confess â™ª

â™ª I don't honestly
know his name but I, I â™ª

â™ª I like the way he is â™ª

â™ª So why give it and give it â™ª

Hey, buddy.

How you doing man? What can I do for you?

I'm looking for Sonny.

Sonny. Well, we don't have any Sonny.

But I got some OJ, a little
soda, some purple stuff.

Look dude, I'm not a cop.


Look, I need to talk to Sonny, all right?

It's important.

I told you, Sonny's not here.

Well where can I find him?

Look man, I just pour the drinks.

You want something?

Look, he'd want you to help me, all right?

Otherwise I'm gonna have to call the cops.

Don't piss me off.

You want Sonny, you come when Sonny's here.

Otherwise talk to the manager.

Need an after one special.

You the manager?


I'm looking for Sonny.

You won't find Sonny
looking at the classy lady.

Isn't this his place?

I'm the classy lady, Irma.

Look, a friend of mine's missing.

I think Sonny could help.

You want this?

Why would I want that?

Gave you a fucking shot, french fry.

What the fuck?

What is that?

Listen kid, Poot's gonna
be in tomorrow around two.

Why don't you come in and
talk to him, all right?

Get yourself out of here.

Hey hey hey!

It ain't nice to leave
without tipping the ladies.

(ominous music)

(Love moaning)

(Love gasping)

Hey there, sleepy head.


Love and Hate.

Uh, that is too grand
to be a coniencidence.

Just means that my parents were into peace

and yours were santanists.

(Hate giggles)

Oh, I'll free you from that logic soon.

Let me go.

Go?

You ain't going nowhere, Love.


Oh, come on now.

Shh, now listen to me.

Become the truth.

Huh?

Oh shh.

Show me the way.

Yes, you be the key.

You reap the glory.

The way is to let me go.

Oh see, people always want revolution

but you have to force them to participate.

Now, I see your cravin' for change.

It's our craving.

(Love sobbing)

That's it.

We must leave our skin.

You're a late bloomer, huh?

Fucking middle school anarchist!

Man has...

Ah! Blah! Blah, crazy!

No, you don't understand.

You are fucking crazy.
I don't understand you.

There's no magic anymore!

(Love sobbing)

They take that away from you

and make you doubt it was even there.

But revolution has magic.

The magic of revolution.

The magic revolution.

Let's just become about

shakin' shit up to make
people believe something.

To force 'em to believe!

And it ain't for free, either.

You always gotta give 'em somethin'.

No such thing as blind faith anymore.

Everybody wants somethin' so you gotta

give it to 'em to keep the
energy balancing, you know?

Something like...

(dramatic music) (Love screams)

(Love sobbing)

The whole world is pain, Love.

We must find pleasure in it.

Shh. (Love sobbing)

Shh.

(Love sobbing)

Good.

Love, let's take this slow, shall we?

(Love screaming)

Shh. (Love sobbing)

Yeah, now...

(Love sobbing)

(Love grunting)

(Love panting and sobbing)

I'm afraid I'm gonna have to enter you now.

(Love grunting and groaning) Shh. Shh.


Hold still.

Do I know you?

Yeah we've done business before.


What's it called, Narcee?

I'm not a cop, come on.

Oh, we got a slick one!

Look, I wanna talk to Sonny.

He's listed.

I've tried that.

Really?

Yeah.

Hold on, let me try.

(makes beeping sounds)

(hums engaged tone)

Sucks for you!

Bye.


She was supposed to call me last night.

Wow. Okay.

How do I put this, um, delicate?

She's out, trickin' dick.

Did you think you were special?

Look, I wanna talk to Sonny.

(Poot chuckles)

You're a stalker, huh?

Jackson's no stalker though, huh?

Uh...

okay!

Were you pretending, hm?

You know, you brought a
valiant fight to the fuck.

My army will rise with
that spirit as its backbone.

It was resistance.

And what army? You and the other two tarts?


Well, you see, Love,

you buy a toy that's
broken, you know what you're

playing with, you know?

Cleb and Selma have proven their loyalty.

Now, they're gonna be dust soon but...

well, they served their purpose!

You win.

Untie me.

Let's go revolt.

Really?

No, I think I'll go have lunch.

(Love grunts) (Hate chuckles)

But, when I come back...

I'm gonna beat the holy crap out of you.

And then, I'll deliver you unto the portal.

Enjoy your last meal.

(Hate chuckles)

Yeah, try that.

Go ahead, you just lie
there with your pretty self

and you will me to choke or something.

Better yet.

Now...

you just try to get a hand free.

I come back, you'll
smother me with a pillow.

Now that I know your death
wish I'll be sure to satisfy.

Oh...

I hope you mean that.

Anyway.

(Love gasps)

Don't go crying when I leave this room now.

I'll be listening.

(door closing)

I figured it'd be that way.

As long as I didn't send the car around.

Second night is gonna cost you though,

those are my best girls.

Uh-huh.

Same as before, plus three more.

Mm-hm.

I'll run the card again.

Enjoy.

Stalker, followed me.

I'm looking for Love.

We can't guarantee anything
but, I know some wild chicks.

Have a seat, start talking money.

Look, cut the bullshit, all right?

You know who I'm talking about.


It's okay, Poot. I'm
in a better mood today.

Look, no disrespect, all right?

I'm just worried about her.

Tabby, start me some businessin' music.

(rock music)

You called.

What was your name?

Ned.

Now peep this, Ned.

Love is a hooker. Nasty.

Me? I'm a pimp.

Love's pimp.

I pick who gets to get their jollies off.

On her face.

Are your jollies backed up?

I'm her boyfriend.

People always have to pay me first.

She was supposed to call me last night.

People always have to pay me first!

Tabby!

Look, I just wanna know if she's okay!

Sonny, do you know where she is? Please.

Hey!

Um...

Sonny says that if you see Love again,

he's gonna break both your legs.

And he's not talking about both your legs,

he's also talking about breaking hers too.

Nice meetin' ya!

(ominous music)

(Love panting)

(Love grunting and groaning)

Do you hear something?

Desperation.

(Love groaning and sobbing)

(Love screaming)

(Love panting)

(tense music)

Oh, god!

Oh, there's a catch.

Oh, we got one.

(Hate whistling)

(Love panting)

She is beautiful.

Just another canary.

(Love screaming) (dramatic music)

[Selma] Going somewhere?
[Hate] Hold her.

What? Come without a call?

Please don't do this to me.

Don't give up.

(Selma chuckles)

â™ª Aw shit girl, break
out your titties â™ª

â™ª Shake 'em around, I got your tip â™ª

â™ª What's it gonna
take for you to strip â™ª

We need to meet like this more often.

You know, you're a real life saver, Mike.

I'd rather be a Skittle.

(Ned and Mike chuckle)

Hi, uh, do you sell donuts?

My friend and I are here
on a stakeout and we're

awfully hungry.

Be a while to ya, darlin'.


That's adorable.

But what you can do, you
can get my friend here

a large soda pop.

I'll bring him a coke.

Yes.

She went to the bathroom.

(Ned chuckles)

Did I just order you a soda?

I mean, in this places, you never can tell.

Elvis is weed, Marilyn
is coke, so we're good.

Look at you all gritty nitty!

Gritty nitty.

(Mike giggles)

All right, seriously. Your Love?

She's a keeper.

Yeah...

I would say I'm pretty
head-over-heels for her.

That's what I've been saying.

You have been saying that.

Yeah. Yeah.

She's pretty awesome.

You're pretty awesome.

Now, do you think you're up for this?

SOCOM.

Call of Duty.

Oh, yes.

Counter-fucking-Strike

Headshot.

Fuckin' A. Hey!

Dude, you cannot doubt
my wingman capabilities

or commitment.

Sweet.

I mean, I don't even know if
he's gonna come back or not.

No matter what, plans
A through C, I'm here.

Well it's more like a big plan A, you know,

or nothing, and nothing isn't happening.

Seven bucks.

Can we put this on a tab
'cause we're probably gonna

order some more sodas.

Sure.

Ah man, thanks.

Hey!

That's him right there.

Hey!

Hi there, baby! (giggles)

You been working out?
You look really strong.

Oh yeah, that's why I'm all sweaty.

I've been working out
at the HomeTown Buffet.


All right, listen, so
keep your eyes on him.

If he leaves, just give me a call.

Are you sure you just don't
want me to ride with you?

No no. I don't want you getting
mixed up with Sonny, man.

He is bad news.

Keep your eyes on the goon.

Give me a call.

(Mike drowned out by atmospherics)

(stripper giggling) (Poot mumbling)

And there it goes!

It's like David Copperfield.

The champagne room?

Ah, but there's no champagne there though!


I'm gonna need change!

(police siren)


Where is she?

Your bitch don't even
tell you where she lives.

Because she stays here.

This is home invasion.


your door should be stronger.

I shoot trespassers.

Prince!


Like you know how to use it.

Hell, I never even keep it loaded.

Play a lot of video games, do ya?

I want the address where you sent her.


and a lot of debt.

I'll keep the gun then.

I've got more.

I dare you to go for them.

You know the problem with being a hero?

Saving everyone else and no
one will watch your own ass.

You think that I'm not a hero

'cause I'll have no problem
packin' up and running far away.

Now give me the fucking address!

Tabby, notebook.

Give me that. Give me the fucking thing.

I'll be watching your ass.

The only way you'll see
me again is if this address

is wrong.


Shutting the fucking door
before the fucking turtle

gets into the fucking sewer

and gets teenage fucking mutated.

Sometimes I swear, if you weren't my kid...

Yeah? You would.

Yeah, I might.


Come here and give daddy a big wet one.

All right.

You see, suspension keeps
the energy at the threshold.

Spasms can send her back over
the portal and back again.

So, the alert spirit

uses that friction to toe the line.

At least in theory, anyway.

Most just die.

But you ain't most.

Why do you wanna work at Wordack?

I need a job.

Our counselors have to deal
with women who are abused,

who have been raped, who
are addicted to drugs.

It's very serious work, very trying work.

Yeah I understand that.

Well generally, we require our employees

to have a college degree.

I don't have that.

And you don't have very
much work experience.

And no references.

What makes you think you're
qualified for this position?

(Love chuckles)

Did you lose your virginity to your father?

Yeah probably not, huh?

Fucked is all I got until I
skipped out on high school.

I saw a way out and I took it.

Have you ever smoked crack?

Hm?

Shot heroine? Snorted coke?

Stayed up a week on meth
and then took whatever pills

you could find laying around?

Not because you were having
fun but because you are

definitely not having fun.

What about dressed up in your Sunday best

to go suck cock for money?

Only to get blood on it

because your pimp had his ring on,

because you handed him wrinkled bills.

You know and sometimes,
you don't even bother using

a condom because hey, if you're
lucky you'll catch a disease

and you might have something
in life and an end in sight.

Or do you know what it's like
to work a job where any night

you can end up dead in
an alleyway somewhere?

Face-down in the dirt, knowing no one,

no one's gonna give a shit
'cause you don't give a shit.

Yeah well, I give a shit.

What makes you think you're
so qualified for this position?

When would you be available to start?

Um, Monday?

Good. We'll set up a drug test.

Yeah, okay.

Thanks.


Yeah.



You can only stall until your last breath.

(Jenna screaming)

(Halley gasping)


(Hate breathing heavily)




(breathing heavily)

Okay.

It's not...

it's not in my nature

to go easy

on anything or anyone.

But...

I wanted to give you an advantage.

It's perfect.

You, fighting to live...


and me fighting to die.

One-on-one
time.

I'm not fighting for you.

It wasn't a choice.

Oh...

you brought ghosts!

Ladies.

(dramatic music)

(grunting and groaning) (thuds)


They really owe you
enough to finish the job.

Ah!

I fucked up!

I gave 'em peace.

Oh.

Is this the last act, lover?

(dramatic music) (Love screaming)

(Love panting)

(somber music)

(dark dramatic music)

No!

No, don't...

Don't go.

Don't leave me, come on.

Come on!


I need help!

1807 Fetiga Road.

Help, please.

Hurry up!

You have given me...

the world.

(Love gasps)

Oh, I thought I was gonna lose you.

Help's on their way right now.

I love you.

Nighty night time, little man.

Daddy loves his baby boy.

Yes he does, yes he does.

(ominous music) (door rattling)

Again?

Don't know who the hell you think you are.

But I am the wrong man to be getting into

a pissing contest with!

Now I'm gonna fix that
door right after I fix you!

Stay away from me.

Stay away from, stay away from me!

No! No! No!

(Poot coughing)

Give it back then.

So...

where are you goin'?

Some self-imposed hell with sunshine?

You know, I could use a new lackey.

I seemed to have misplaced my last ones.

Turns out they were
more interested in escape

than fighting.

See you don't wanna have to go to this side

but you do gotta be ready.

Else you're just a haunting.

Ghost feign.

Are you a ghost?

You haven't grasped any of this, have you?

Fuckin' hurt me, man.

Use it.

Use it to release your fear of the unknown.

I don't wanna die.

Well that betters your odds then.

See if you got what it takes
to join me in revolution.


Against what?

Humanity.

Shit. You are a ghost.

I am hope.

For God so loved the world
that he fuckin' vanished.

Me, I hate it.

I hate it with a passion so strong

it'll be changed forever.

Death!

Death is transition to a new beginning.

Why?

Why do you have to come here

and fuck with me, man?

Well...

there's a certain dignity in

playing avenging angel for that...

someone special.

Sonny here is just a
threat to the investment.

You? You're nothing special.

No, you are the mind of the masses.

(clicks tongue)

(blows raspberry)

I'm the mind of the...

I'm the mind of the masses?

Mind of the masses.

All right.

I got here...

due to criminal tendencies.

Aw.

I never wanted to be a rocket surgeon or,

a brain scientist, I just
wanted good ol' crooked livin'

with a little bit of killer butt.

Mm-hm.

What I'm doing here, is I
am getting kicked in the ass

due to lack of ambition
and I am being offered this

clean slate so long as I
believe that allowing you to...

flay me is the best way to do that.

Where am I going?

Where I'm going is, up in smoke.

I'm gonna get the mind of the masses

higher than a motherfucker.

You don't happen to have a light?

The world will be made in my image.

Even if I am the last spirit standing.

How the fuck do you
know all this shit, man?

Electroshock intuition.

But mostly...

I just make it all up.

(snaps fingers)

(rock music) Ah!

You ready?

Okay, you can sit down and we'll talk

and we'll smoke this, come on.

Let's find a lighter.

Okay okay okay, we were
talking, that was fine.

On the downbeat.

Five.

Six.

Five six seven.
