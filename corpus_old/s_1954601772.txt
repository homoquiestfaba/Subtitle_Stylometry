<i>( crowd murmuring )</i>

<i>( applause )</i>

<i>( music playing )</i>

Welcome back,
and of course, I'm Freddy Fine.

Okay, ladies,
you're going for the $50,000.

<i>( audience cheers )</i>

Now you will have
60 seconds on the clock.

Good luck.

Here is
your first subject.

<i>( bell dings )</i>

Go!

Lemonade, um, ice cream,
sleep-away camp--

Things I told you
to avoid.

Things that
make you fat.

Picnics, uh, barbecues--

Fattening events.
Places where they have too much food.

No.
( stammers )

Beaches, uh,
swimming pools.

( stammers )
Coney Island.

Places where I told you
never to wear a bathing suit.

Places where
you eat too much.

What?! Pass!

<i>( bell dings )</i>

Uh-- um,
satin lingerie, silk underwear--

Things only a slut would wear.
Things you can't fit into.

Cashmere sweater,
uh, suede jacket--

Things
you can't afford.

Wha-- pass.

<i>( bell dings )</i>

Oh, just pass.

Ma!

<i>( bell dings )</i>

Cake batter, uh,
chocolate milk--

Things that are bad for you.
Things you shouldn't eat.

Emotions, Mom,
deep-rooted emotions.

<i>( buzzer )</i>

Ohh! Too bad.

So sad.

Now what if I would have
said "hot soup".

Things you stir?
( chuckling ) Oh, yes! Yes!

( speaks Spanish )

What do emotions have
to do with stirring?

So sad.

<i>( alarm clock blaring )</i>

( gasps )
Ah, crap!

( groans )

<i>( alarm stops blaring )</i>

Woman on recording:
<i>Chapter 11: Emotional</i> <i>Blackmail.</i>

<i>Let's first start by</i>
<i>taking a deep breath in</i>

<i>and letting go of</i>
<i>any negative thoughts.</i>

( sighs ) One breath
ain't gonna do it. - Woman: <i>Good.</i>

<i>Now imagine</i>
<i>the emotional noose around</i> <i>your neck loosening up.</i>

( neck cracks )
( sighs )

Told you.

<i>Feel the breath of newfound</i>
<i>freedom entering your loins.</i>

( blows raspberry )

<i>Good.</i>

<i>â™ª Everybody's</i>
<i>got those days â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª When the sun don't shine</i>
<i>like it should â™ª</i>

   <i>â™ª Everyone gets</i>
<i>the blues... â™ª</i> <i>- Come on!</i>

Come on, Spanx,
don't fail me now.

<i>â™ª ...weather outside</i>
<i>isn't good â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm no exception</i>
<i>to the rule â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I have my days,</i>
<i>just gotta remember â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Things are always nice</i>
<i>in some way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So let's keep it moving â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Deep into the night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª We got to keep on</i>
<i>feeling real good â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ohh, let's keep it rolling</i>
<i>deep into the night â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Make sure the good times</i>
<i>keep on coming â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Let's get it right â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Better believe that karma</i>
<i>is for real, so... â™ª</i>

<i>( horn honking )</i>

Man:
Hey, sweetheart, I'd eat you for free.

Piss off!

<i>( cell phone rings )</i>

Wonder Bash Events,
how can we save your day?

Save it for the 'rents,
Pinocchio, it's just me.

Isn't it too early for you
to be stalking me?

Fair enough.

So are you really
expecting a call from a client?

You never know.

You know,
you could move back home,

maybe start over,
save some money.

Yeah, I'd rather
move to Jersey.

Your pride
is overwhelming.

Yeah, and your sarcasm
is annoying.

I can see the stress
of moving home

is just destroying
your usual warmth.

I'm coming home for
an aunt's funeral that we barely even know.

I know.
Poor Aunt Sharon.

<i>Sally.</i>
<i>- Sally, right.</i>

What? Oh.

   <i>( horn honks,</i>
<i>tires screech )</i> <i>- Whoa!</i>

Lex?
<i>( screams )</i>

Let me call you back.
You okay?

<i>( horn continues honking )</i>
<i>- No! I gotta go!</i>

<i>( siren blaring in distance )</i>

Wait, did you
get the tickets?

What?
Mind your business.

Sorry about your balls.

No worries.

I've had worse things
happen to my balls.

Wait, are we
having a party?

Oh, yeah, well,
Mrs. Gonzalez

wanted Mr. Muchacho,
and so, see, I had to hire

an authentic Latino
to play a Latino character, you know what I mean?

Um, no,
but how L.A. of you.

<i>There could be a freakin'</i>
<i>albino Asian man</i>

under there and nobody
would know the difference.

Come on, Mo, you know
I need the money.

Yeah, well, but see,
the thing is--

No, Mo,
you cut the crap.

When I agreed to dress in
these fucktard costumes--

Shh! Hey, hey.
It was under the assumption

I'd be planning
all of your events.

Wasn't that the deal?
( sighs )

Huh?

I'm out.
I'm out!

Okay, well,
have a safe trip home.

Hey, and leave my other ball
on the way out.

<i>( cell phone rings )</i>

Wonder Bash Events,
how can I save your day?

Man:
<i>Can I speak to Cara, please?</i>

Oh, this is Cara.

How can I
please you today?

<i>Do you have time</i>
<i>for your secret lover?</i>

Always. What is
your pleasure today?

<i>You, me,</i>
<i>and a chimpanzee.</i>

Ohh,
sounds dangerous!

So, do I need a whip
to tame the chimp?

<i>Nope, just for me.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>( incoming call beep )</i>

Oh, well, I'm gonna
just put you on hold for one sec

so I can get
that whip, okay? -    <i>Okay.</i>

Hey.
<i>Hola.</i>

Hey, so I'm on the other line
with a potential client...

Really?
What kind of shindig are you trying to book?

One that requires a lot of
sweet talking and a tug.

Can you hold, please?
Holding.

You still there,
bad boy?

Man:
<i>I never left.</i> <i>Did you get the whip?</i>

In hand.
( mimics whip crack )

<i>Oh, yeah!</i>
<i>Now we're talkin'.</i>

Ohh! Oh, you know what?

Can I just put you on hold
for one more minute

so I can get
my panties off?

<i>Okay.</i>

<i>Hey, so this is gonna be</i>
<i>a lot longer than expected.</i>

<i>Could I just</i>
<i>call you back?</i>

You have
a difficult client?

Oh, I hate those.

No, look, just--
I'm calling to remind you

to pack
your skinny jeans.

Crap! Skinny jeans,
skinny jeans, skinny jeans. ( stammering )

Yeah, I figured
it's gonna help keep Mom off your back about Daniel

if you show up looking
malnourished.

Uh-huh, noted.

Thanks for the...
reminder.

Um, okay,
so I gotta go.

Bye.
See you. Bye.

Hey there, bad boy,
mission accomplished.

Panties off,
whip in hand.

Now tell me...

what would you like me
to do to your chimpanzee?

Lex? Chimpan--

<i>Lexie, did you just</i>
<i>say chimpanzee?</i>

( gasps )
Ohh!

Ohh!

( moans )

Monkey junk!

Oh, no!

Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

No, no, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no.
Ohh.

Oh, my goodness, pick up,
pick up, pick up, pick up,

pick up, pick up, pick up.
( sighs )

Damn! Hey, it's me.

I'm totally gonna
miss my flight.

I am so sorry.
Can you just tell Mom that something happened?

I don't know, say something,
like, spice it up or something.

Tell her that
there was an earthquake or something like that.

<i>â™ª It's like home to me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª On a crazy spree â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can't let you be... â™ª</i>

Man, just right up here
on your right is cool.

Thank you.

That card's been declined.
Of course it is.

Yeah, I'm sure
I have cash-- oh, Christ!

Louis, you--
Hello, hello, hello, you!

Mmm!

So, uh, you need a buck
or, uh, maybe you'd rather--

Yes, I need a buck.
Just--

Lou, just pay
the man, yeah?

Here you go, pally.

Keep it.

Here you go.

Oh, let me get that.
<i>No, I got it.</i>

No, I got it.
No, Lou, I got it.

I got it.
I'm here for you, I'm here for you.

Nothing but a chicken wing.
You're getting it. Okay.

I am here for you.
Okay, excuse me.

So, uh, rumor in the hood
is that you are newly single. What's that all about?

Uh, well, my husband
died a year ago,

so it's not that new.

Yeah, but you're
still single, right?

Am I right?
Not necessarily, all right?

A lot can happen
in a year.

Yeah, like what?
Like...

'90s hair can
go out of style--

are you still wearing
that cologne?

That's my Sean John.
Ugh.

Oh, and, like, '90s
tight acid-washed jeans didn't go out of style?

These aren't
acid-washed jeans.

Psst.
Hey, Louie, you almost ready?

Hey, Dom, give me five.
We don't have five, Lou.

It's Thirsty Thursdays,
we open early.

Dom, I'd like you to meet
my lady friend Lexie.

Lexie, this is--
It's Alexis, it's Alexis.

Alexis, this is my friend--
Boss.

My boss friend Dominic.

Alexis.
Nice to meet you.

<i>Hey, you should bring her</i>
<i>by the club some night.</i>

First two rounds
are on me.

Ooh! Big spender!
Big man on campus.

Alexis: <i>All right,</i>
<i>see you later, Lou-Lou.</i> <i>Gotta go see my family.</i>

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I haven't seen my family in a while.

As always,

it is a pleasure
and a privilege. ( clicks tongue )

You're still saying that?

Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Before I forget, uh...

Freestyle Fridays.
Yours truly's DJ'ing.

( mimics record scratching )
Lou-Lou, you did not--

give it to me.
( beatboxing )

Okay, Lou.
I've been ballin' and I hurt my foot,

but I still
got moves, baby.

Sure.

Hey, hey, baby girl!

Daddy!
( laughing )

I missed you so much!

Woman:
Leonard! Are you in the kitchen?

Get out of the fridge.

<i>I told you we're going</i>
<i>to be eating soon.</i> <i>- Okay.</i>

( gasps )
<i>Hol</i>Lexita.

You're late.

Yeah, I forgot
to tell the pilot

that you were
a stickler for time, Mom.

( laughs, speaks Spanish )

Ma-- okay.

So how are you, Mom?

Okay, is this done?
I don't even know what we're doing.

Lexie.
( sighs ) I'm sorry, <i>mija.</i>

It's just that we haven't
seen you in so long

and I'm just absorbing...

all of you.

Wow.

You really don't
disappoint, do you?

( speaks Spanish )

No, Mom, caffeine
makes me sleepy and you know it.

I just need to
take a shower. I had a long flight.

Yes, you go, <i>mamita,</i>

and brush your hair
while you're in there.

And if you need some makeup,
there's plenty in the cabinet.

I have makeup on, Mom.

( speaks Spanish )

She looks like <i>mierda.</i>

<i>Ay.</i>
<i>- Mmm.</i>

Holy Mother of God.
Oh, shit!

I should have knocked,
I'm so sorry.

What if I was really
dropping a deuce?

( sighs )

Truthfully, I find it, um,

just a little bit
more disturbing

that Mom has a picture
of Daniel alone in the hallway.

Really?
I find it more disturbing

that you were having
phone sex with a chimp.

Wait, no, I thought
we weren't gonna touch that one.

Oh, we weren't?
Oh, I'm sorry. -    <i>No.</i>

Oh, my God!
( laughing )

I missed you.
I missed you!

Oh, you forget.

Our mother is half hound,
she will find it, believe me.

( sighs )
<i>Hey, you found</i> <i>your skinny jeans.</i>

Lookin' good, Mr. Kotter.
Thanks.

I think if I fart,
I may rip the seams.

Okay. Turn that frown
upside down.

You're home!
For a funeral.

Well, if that's
what it takes so be it.

Anyway, who has time
for Danny drama

when our own loving mother
is waiting patiently downstairs

to deliver some <i>nove</i>style
drama of her own.

Did I tell you that
I was jet lagged?

Like, just
like this much?

<i>( Mom yelling in Spanish )</i>

Well,
ding, ding, ding!

Let the games begin.

Do I look... fat?
Or just bloated?

Is that
a trick question?

( gasps ) Come on!
I'm just kidding.

( groans )
You look perfect!

This is gonna be
so fun!

<i>We're coming!</i>

Mmm! Mmm, mm, mmm!

( speaks Spanish )

<i>Hija,</i>    I made it
with one percent.

<i>Mam</i>can she
have some food?

( gasps ) Oh!
I'm sorr<i>mijita.</i>

She hasn't seen
"Real Women Have Curves" yet.

I got it for her
for Mother's Day.

How long
have I been home?

Long enough to remember
why you left.

So, Dad,
how you holding up?

Hmm? Yeah?

Got any last-minute details

you want help with,
any arranging, organizing?

<i>Ay, Dios mÃ­o,</i>
<i>always the party planner.</i>

Lexita, have you ever
thought about retaking

the dental
admissions exam?

Nope, never,
not once.

You should.

You know, if I hadn't
gone to trade school to become a hygienist,

Both:
I would have never met your father.

( laughing )

Yeah, see, I don't know
what that has to do with the conversation--

Okay, let me
just boom, bang, pow

<i>my way into this</i>
<i>potential disaster.</i>

Party planning
is in Lexie's DNA. <i>Ay,</i> no.

So is bipolar
and depression--

Okay, it's in my DNA,
I got it.

You know, Mo is giving me
a lot of extra parties, you know?

And with the holidays
just a few months away, I'm gonna be a lot busier.

Santa's gonna need
helpers, like...

elves and such.

You know, I wonder
why Hanukkah Julio

isn't more popular
in Los Angeles,

seeing as it's
the city of Jews.

Angels, it's
the City of Angels.

It's the City of Angels?
Yeah.

And Hanukkah Julio
was a character Dad made up

to make sure that
we didn't feel alone in this world.

What? Dad!

That can't possibly
be a surprise to you.

( snickering )
Oh, okay. Okay.

Well, since we are
revealing family secrets,

<i>I have one of my own.</i>

Has to do with you,
Lexita.

Okay, wait, this is not
another intervention

because I'm down
to four pills a day!

N<i>mija,</i>    we gave up
on that a while ago.

This isn't a blind date,
right, Mom?

No, it's so much better!

I ran into Mrs. Wasserstein
at an open house...

God, does she still think
she's related to us?

In fact,
she is related to us.

She's Uncle Stan's
ex-wife.

Uh, so, technically
she's not.

So, anyway, okay,
back to me, thank you.

She knows you're
back in town

and she wants you
to help with her daughter's Bat Mitzvah!

You're welcome!
What?

<i>Â¿Que quÃ©?</i>
<i>- Dude, is that</i> <i>your little secret?</i>

Yes!
Are you surprised?

Because...
you look surprised.

This...
Yeah.

...this is not surprised,
this is pissed.

What did you tell her?
I told her hell yeah, of course.

Did you tell her
that I don't have a business anymore, Kayla?

No.
Lexita, you know that we don't tell

other people those things.
Whatever.

You're kidding, right?
No.

Right?
No!

Right?! Dude!
No.

Come on! I have a life
that's 3,000 miles away.

You have a life 3,000--
I have a life 3,000 miles away

and I can't just put it
on hold because--

because you want
to book an event for me without my consent.

( scoffs )
Lexie, look.

If you take this job,
maybe you can make some, uh,

some connections,
all right?

<i>And this way Wonder Bash</i>
<i>can have a new life,</i>

a rebirth of a sort
right here in New York.

Do you see how good
that sounds?

Oh, does it?
Does it really?

It does sound good.
You know what else sounds good?

Paying your bills

or pay for some
plane tickets.

Mom:
<i>I thought we all</i> <i>discussed this already.</i>

Alexis needs stability.

And party planning
will not allow her

the time she needs
to get her life together.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Wait, pause, on you.

When did we have
a conversation about my life without me?

I don't remember that.

We're a family,
we do it all the time.

Lexita, don't you think
it's time for you

to move on
from the parties?

From the kiddie parties
and the raccoon costumes?

For the one millionth
time, Mom,

Kung Fu Panda is a panda,
not a freaking raccoon!

Lexie, Lexie, Lexie--
Come on, Lexie!

Right now I need
a little air, Dad.

I mean,
look at my plate.

( sighs )
<i>Ay.</i>

It's the jeans.
They're so tight.

She makes me sweat.
Mom, come on, she's just--

Listen, reality sucks
for her right now.

Once it starts
getting better,

she'll live in it again.

Why should this night
be any different than the other night?

Is that
a trick question?

( voicemail recording )
<i>You have one new message.</i>

Mo on recording: <i>Mo here.</i>

<i>Hope everything's going</i>
<i>good with the fam.</i>

<i>I got some awesome news!</i>

<i>Thought it was worth</i>
<i>a quick call.</i>

<i>Mrs. Lopez wants to have</i>
<i>her son's fifth birthday</i> <i>next Sunday</i>

<i>and she requested</i>
<i>Handy Manny!</i>

Hola!
<i>So I thought of you.</i>

<i>I know you need</i>
<i>the cash.</i>

<i>Give me a call, let me know</i>
<i>if you're available.</i>

I hear he's much more popular
than Dora these days.

Vodka, soda, no ice,
still your fave?

( groans )
Why did you agree to it, Kayla?

Because you need it

and because you
need to pay me back for my plane tickets.

Mo just got me
another job.

I'm gonna be able
to pay you back like next week, all right?

I'm fine.
Fine?

Fine is an acronym

for fucked-up, insecure,
neurotic, and emotional,

so terrific
that you're fine,

but wouldn't you rather
be fine and happy?

I'm happy.
Mmm.

I'm happy.
( chuckles )

And I'm--
I'm really close to clearing my debt.

Oh, your debt,
that's right.

You mean the debt
that you wouldn't have

if you hadn't overslept

and you would have actually
made it to the office

to serve him
the divorce papers?

Yep.
Yep.

Yep, that's it,
that's the debt I'm talking about.

That's the debt right there.
You know, Lexie,

if you take
this Wasserstein gig,

which my sources tell me
is two weeks away--

Two weeks?
Two whole weeks? - Wait, wait, wait.

( sighs )
I will...

get all
my open houses covered

and I will become
your personal assistant.

Your girl Friday of sorts.

Oh, my God!

We're gonna be like
Wonder Twins, dude!

Ooh, Wonder Twin powers,
activate! Come on!

Form of...

a supermodel.

Oh, my God.

Seriously.

Lexie...

would it kill you
to stay here

for a little while longer?

Fine.

Form of
a toilet bowl.

No.

You have to be a liquid.
Dude, come on.

Seriously?
Yeah!

Form of a stronger
vodka soda.

Done.

You know,
if Princess Leia

could choke
Jabba the Hutt

and free herself
while rocking a bikini,

then you,
my darling sister,

can most certainly...

rebuild the lost
Wonder Bash empire.

What is that,
one of your self-help books?

No.

It's a guide
to the best beaches in Hawaii.

Mmm, monkey humping
must be paying well.

It's from
my honeymoon, dude.

Oh. Sorry.

Well...

can't say it's not
a beautiful picture.

Frosty drinks always
make for a good shot.

Shots. Shots!
Come on!

Okay, hey, hey, hey.

I'm just
throwing it out there,

but tomorrow,
Freestyle Fridays, what, what?

Oh, my goodness!

You, me, and
a bottle are three.

Come on, what do you say?
Super fun.

No, thanks.

You're right.
You're right.

Why put off until tomorrow
what we can do today?

Shots, my darling!

<i>( church bell tolling )</i>

Hey, I'm sorry that we didn't
get to know her very well.

You know, I'm sure
she was a great woman.

Actually
she was miserable.

She was never happy
after Ron died

and she... she kind of
locked herself away from the world.

Don't do the same.

You're gonna end up
regretting it a lot.

I know she did.

If you learn anything from me,
it's to forgive, okay?

Estella:
<i>Leonard, let's go!</i>

<i>We have lots</i>
<i>of people waiting</i> <i>back at the house.</i>

I'm not saying it's easy,
but you gotta try.

Hi. Cheers.

Ugh! Boxed wine!

Dad is so cheap.
Okay, listen. - I love boxed wine.

Mrs. Wasserstein
is in the living room, we gotta talk to her.

<i>Mira, hijas,</i> you think
this is a proper time to conduct business?

Mom, we get it.

You don't approve,
blah, blah, blah.

( speaks Spanish )

Well, at least brighten up
that sad, sad look on your face, Lexita.

We're sitting shiva,
Mom, it's sad. - Yeah.

Well, if that's
your excuse, so be it.

Either way, I think
it's inappropriate.

But if you must...
<i>ay, mira...</i>

at least put on
some lipstick.

Okay, Mom, really?

Listen, I think
she has a point.

You might want to smile
a little bit...

Make sure
she puts it on.

She needs color.

( speaks Spanish )

<i>Hola!</i>

Oh, my goodness.
Well, <i>hola</i> to you, too.

You remember
my sister Alexis?

Of course I do.
How are you?

She-- well, we
are very excited

about helping Shari
with her Bat Mitzvah.

Well, I'm super excited, too,

'cause I'm getting two
for the price of one.

Well, metaphorically,
right? Right?

I'm really, really
appreciative that you're doing this,

especially considering
the circumstances.

That is my daughter Shari.

Hi.
Kayla: <i>Hey.</i>

Hi.

Okay. So, um, why don't we
get started on the details

seeing that
we're all here?

Can't start without
a fist bump.

Wonder Twin powers...

Activate!
Form of an iceberg.

Fangirl?
Totally. You?

Since I'm, like, 23!
Wow.

Super late start,
but still super cool.

Right?
Come on!

Okay, well, isn't
this just fabulous?

Am I being "Punk'd"?
Like, where are the cameras?

Anyway, so I had Shari's
therapist's receptionist

make you a tip sheet.

Yes, it seems that
the last party planner

dropped the ball
on a whole bunch of things,

and the catering got
the bulk of the budget,

so you've really got your
work cut out for you.

Um, before we start,
I'm so sorry.

I just wanna
double-check on this date

'cause my understanding was
that we had two weeks, not one.

Uh, no, that's correct.

And besides, I hear that you
can make miracles happen.

Yes, she can.
Yes.

Okay, well,
I guess, um,

we just have a lot to do
with a small window.

What's left in your budget?
Uh, hm.

Like I said, the caterer
took up a big chunk,

so I'd say about,
mm, 2,035, 2,036?

Wow, okay,
and how many guests

uh, approximately
have RSVP'd? - About 60.

Wow, okay, well--
ahem.

So what we're gonna
do is we're gonna just

compromise on the venue
and we'll just be

a little more selective as
to how many superheroes we hire.

Ahem.

Oh, oh--
um, but, um--

but I'm sure that me
and my partner-in-crime here

<i>can totally make</i>
<i>miracles happen.</i> <i>- You know it.</i>

So, um, what is
the number one superhero

that you just must have?

I love Wonder Woman.

Oh.
That's great!

And the Wonder Twins.

Oh, my God, this is
gonna be so awesome! - Okay, not your party.

Um, do you have a dress?
Yep.

But Mom doesn't approve.

Uh, in this case,
Mom is right

and you're gonna
have to get something

that's a little bit more...
fitting for the occasion.

It's totally fitting.

( speaks Spanish )

People are starting
to leave.

They want to get
home before sundown.

Come say
<i>Shabbat Shal-adios.</i>

Okay, well,
you have my number.

Feel free to use it anytime

and I just wanna say
that I think

it is fabulous
that you are moving on.

This is going to be
the best party ever.

Oh, and Kayla,
don't forget Gleek.

The twins are nothing
without him.

You know that.
Of course I do!

Who doesn't?

What?
Why the frown, Charlie Brown?

Kinda slipped up on that
timeframe, huh, sister poo?

Oh, please, one week.

We can so do this.

Just pull out your guns
and start firing.

Wine and dine
some old associates.

Just do your thing, sister.

I have seen you
do it before.

Yeah, when I had
a business, Kayla, okay?

And you just promised
that little girl Gleek.

You promised her Gleek,
and if my memory

serves me correctly,
Gleek is, um, a monkey.

Your memory
serves you incorrectly.

He's a blue monkey.

Where are we gonna find
a blue monkey in Brooklyn?

The Bronx Zoo.

Blue.
We'll paint him!

I'm done with you, mm-hmm.
Nice.

Not very Wonder-Twin-like
of you.

<i>Shalom.</i>

( speaks Spanish )

Titi wants to see you.

You haven't spoken to her
since Daniel's funeral.

Yeah because she doesn't
speak English.

<i>Ay,</i> Lexita,
don't make everyone pay for your misery.

Titi... hi.

<i>Ay.</i>

( speaks Spanish )

God bless "ju."

Did she just
call me a "ju"?

( speaks Spanish )
( speaks Spanish )

All right,
God bless you.

What?
She meant well, you know?

Yeah, Mom,
I'm sure she did,

but really,
the only person that's mourning

Daniel's death is you.

Are you that disconnected
from everything?

That you can't even see
how his death has affected you?

Okay, I am not gonna listen
to this psychoanalytic nonsense.

<i>I'm just not.</i>
<i>-</i> <i>This is not psychoanalytical,</i> <i>hija.</i>

This is just obvious
to everyone.

Esse, your brothers
are here--

Chino, Chewie,
and Chachi.

<i>Ay.</i>

Leonard, you know
that's not their names.

Well,
they're still here.

Thank you.
Mm... yeah.

It looked painful
from afar.

I can only imagine
what it was like close-up.

No, no, you can't.

After 32 years,
I say I can.

Hey.

Let me ask you
a question.

Do you think I look
better than Princess Leia?

No.

Yes, no, I don't know.

I don't even know
what you said. - Oh, you know what?

I told you
Mom is a bloodhound.

Come on.

I am so ready
to pop and lock.

Okay, are you ready?
Are you ready?

That's what
I'm talking about. And check this out.

Nice!

Yes, nobody puts baby
in the corner.

Do you understand?
Will they get over them?

Okay, now, seriously.

Would Han Solo
wanna get with this?

Would he wanna get
with this?

â™ª Take me on
the Millennium Falcon. â™ª

What? What, what?

<i>( music playing )</i>

Oh!
â™ª Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. â™ª

We're here,
we're here.

Get ready--
what's up, y'all?

Wait for me!

Ow!
Hey, ladies.

What can I get
you tonight?

Two B&Bs.

A little fire in the hole
to get this night started.

Whoo!

We are going back,
way back.

'91 style!
Oh.

I was so much happier
in '91... and thinner.

Oh, my God,
I was born in '91. Awesome year.

Me too,
I was born in '91 too. - Yeah, me too.

Whoa!

Think you could bounce
a nickel off of that butt?

Tried it...
it does.

Oh, man, Pizza Bagel.

How 'bout a round of drinks
on you for us?

All right... Summer!
Yeah?

Okay.
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm.

Okay.

Glad you could make it.

Ahem.

So, uh, look around.

Take your time.

Let me know if there's
anything I can do you for,

and, uh, I'll be back
to dance with you...

later.

Okay.
All right.

Mm.

Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm, mm.
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm--

Kayla:
Okay, is that-- is that, like, a move now?

It sure is.
That's how we do it.

Wow, are you--
Boys!

Back to the booth!

Pronto!

( both groan )

Okay.
( yells )

Here we go.

Shake the cooties off.
( sighs )

To the dance floor.

( both cough )

You trying to poison us?
Summe<i>Have fun, ladies!</i>

Whoo!

<i>â™ª Hey â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hey â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hey â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hey, ladies,</i>
<i>get that ass off the wall â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fellas, hands up,</i>
<i>come back for more â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Hustlers, get their</i>
<i>cash flow galore â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Let's go, let's go,</i>
<i>vamos, vamos</i> <i>â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Ladies, get that ass</i>
<i>off the wall â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Fellas, hands up,</i>
<i>come back for more â™ª</i>

â™ª Hustlers, get their cash flow
<i>galore â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Let's go, let's go,</i>
<i>vamos, vamos.</i> <i>â™ª</i>

Mm!

Yes, Summer, yes.

Hey.

Do you think Mom
is disappointed in me?

Are you serious?

God, does this look like
a therapist's office to you?

All right, let me
ask you a question.

If the world
blows up tomorrow,

like the planet
Krypton did,

and everybody else is gone
off the face of the Earth

except you,
who are you gonna blame

for all your pain,
sorrow, and misfortune?

Superman?
( laughs )

Good one, but no.

Mom! Because you're still
gonna be blaming her

for all your problems.

And even though
the world has blown

to millions
of little bits.

Uh-oh, like this.
Ooh, speakers!

( groans )
( crowd gasps )

Excuse me!

Oh, my God.

Summer on radio:
<i>Hey, um, Dom, we've--</i>

<i>we've got some</i>
<i>spring cleaning on the floor.</i>

Yeah, on my way.

Alexis:
<i>Oh, are you okay?</i>

Oh, are you good?

Oh, my God.

I just saw my whole
support system just crumble.

Are you okay?
Yeah.

Excuse me, guys,
excuse me.

Excuse me, I got it.
Oh, this is what I'm talking about.

Excuse me.

( gasps )
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

Friend?
No.

I me-- I mean
sister... friend.

Mm.

Thanks, Mom.

I was thinking she could
hide out for a little bit,

you know, sleep it off.
Yeah, thanks.

God, who knew that doing
the Running Man wouldn't be like riding a bike?

It's one of those moves that
requires some crazy skills.

I thought she had them--
yes, thank you.

Oh, will you
take that for me, please?

Okay, ouch.
What's up?

Oh!
What?

Wow, you're strong.

Just make sure
your brain's not bleeding.

Ah!
She's actually much nicer. I promise.

All right, real quick--
Let me-- let me get it!

Oh!

Did you put this here?

Oh... it's for me.

Um...

I'm gonna leave that
right there.

Um...

So where are you
coming in from? - Uh, Los Angeles.

L.A., Los Angeles.

Oh, yeah?
Where in La La Land do you live?

Venice.

Nice.
I used know it well. - Yeah?

Yep-- so what do
you do out there?

Oh, I--
I plan parties,

like events, and such,
and stuff like that.

<i>It's like</i>
<i>an icebox in here.</i> <i>- Oh, thank you.</i>

Well, that's cool.
Who are you working for?

Oh, I, um-- it's for,
like, this newer,

like, smallish company.

You've probably
never heard of them.

The House of Patties,
and Events, and... Co.

You-- you mean that
burger place on La Brea?

Yeah, but I mean, like,
we do a lot more than flip burgers.

Yeah, like, we, like--

they throw parties there,
and, you know,

sometimes, in, like, big homes,
like, mansions and stuff,

like the Hollywood scene,
but that's, like, ugh.

Yeah, I know them well too.
Yeah.

So what is it
that you do?

I mean, like, do you,
like, travel a lot for work?

Or do you have, like,
a club in L.A.?

Uh, well, I, um--

my wife and I
lived out there pre-kid.

What brought you out
to the West Coast?

Husband.

Ah.
No ring?

Ditto.
( chuckles )

Long story.

Hey, you know what?

We should probably--
probably take this outside.

Oh, like,
keep talking outside.

So what brings you
back home?

Aunt's funeral.

Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry.

That sucks--
No, it's all good.

Thanks.
So how long you in for?

Well, that was--
that's kind of a funny story.

I was supposed to leave
on Sunday.

And then, I got
a gig at the funeral.

( laughs )
Nice.

I mean, it's a weird place
to close a deal,

but, you know,
I guess business is business.

Thank you.
Thanks.

Can't close just 'cause
the coffin does, right? - Right.

Except I, um--
Ahem.

I have one week
and no budget.

A week?

Oh, that's plenty of time
to get a gig up and running.

With superheroes
and a monkey? - Sure, why not?

I mean, we throw
parties here all the time.

When there's a will,
there's a way.

Yeah.

There's a will.

Just don't necessarily
know about the way, you know?

Look.

You get some party favors,

couple of streamers,

some of those frozen
finger foods.

You know, maybe
a couple hot dancers

to spice up the night.

Done.

Yeah, it's not
a bachelor party.

It's a Bat Mitzvah.

Oh.
( laughs )

Okay, got you.

I thought superheroes
was code for strippers.

Boy on radio:
<i>Dad? You there? Over.</i>

Lightning speed. Over.

Hey, bud.

How you feeling?

I'm fine.

Who's that?

Oh, hi, I'm Alexis.

Hey, nice to meet you,
but I meant her.

<i>The snoring one.</i>

Memo...
Sorry.

It's-- it's--
it's all good. That's my sister Kayla.

We just came back in here
to get her because, well, it's getting late,

and, uh--
oh, we better get home or else.

Or else what?
Can you get grounded?

Surprising,
yet extremely possible.

Yeah.
Tell me about it.

When I went to visit
my mom last month,

she tried to ground me

for hiding in the trunk
of her limo.

Limo?
Long story.

Got it.

All right,
come on, sister poo.

Let's get on
out of here.

Thanks for the anger detox.

Hey, anytime.

And good luck
with that party.

Oh, thank you.

And, um, good luck
with that long story. - Thank you.

All right.

All right there?

You good?

There we go.
Why is there a kid in here?

Okay.

Thanks for
the sweater also.

You think Mom has tuna?

Okay.
I like Bumble Bee.

( laughs )
She-- she doesn't really.

Smooth.

<i>( laughter and chatter )</i>

( screaming )

( laughing )

Mom, you can't be hiding
in the dark like a stalker.

I have been waiting
for you girls

for the past three hours.

Oh, Christ, Mom,
we're not 16.

You can't just wait up
in hopes of grounding us.

She can, she is
la reina de castiga.

Queen of punishment.

That's impressive.
I know.

( speaking Spanish )

Ooh, ironic.

Converting to Judaism really
did wonders for you, Mom.

Ma, don't listen.

It's just
the liquor talking.

She's drunk.

She's so drunk.

If I didn't have to worry
about you girls so much,

I wouldn't need these.

Oh, please.

Mom, I'm starving.

Can you make me
some tuna fish?

No, no, God,
you do not need tuna.

All right, I'm taking
Drunkie McDrunkersons upstairs.

( both laughing )

Remember, just bring it
upstairs, please!

No.
Ma, I'm starving!

Please, God, please,
don't make me kill them.

Oh, God, hey.
Okay, grab the bannister now, all right?

Can you believe
this woman?

Whoa.

Ugh, let it go,
Obi-Wan.

Let it go.

( gagging )
Lift the seat!

Where's the aspirin?

Top shelf on the left...

next to the Gas-X.

Thanks.

You girls should
know better.

I thought I told
you both that, uh,

it's not very ladylike
to drink yourself into foolishness.

Yeah, well, you know,

sometimes, even
the perfect slip, Mom.

Good night.

So I hear that your sister
is taking time

from her job
to help you with this party?

Yeah, why?

( speaks Spanish )

Please.

( speaks Spanish )

So what is it
you wanna say?

I have nothing to say.

Right, because that's
in your nature

to just let things go.

Lexita, why
are you so angry?

I'm not angry, Mom.

I'm bitter.
Big difference.

Lexita, it's not very becoming
of you to be so nasty. - Human?

Nasty?

<i>Lexita, mi hija,</i>
<i>why have you given up?</i>

Given up?

Is that what you think
that I've done?

You think
I've given up, Mom?

I haven't given up.

I'm-- I'm just trying to,
like, find my way.

If you ask me--
Well, I didn't!

Well, it looks as if
you've thrown in the towel.

You don't take care
of yourself anymore.

You-- you--
you look tired,

and, well... swollen.

As in fat?
Not my words.

Is this about
the way I look?

Is that what's important
to you?

Lexita, the way someone
presents themselves

affects the way
they are treated. Trust me, I know.

People respond to those
who present themselves in a certain light.

And right now,
it is so obvious

that you have
absolutely no confidence.

<i>( bangs )</i>
<i>- Kayla:</i> <i>Mm.</i>

<i>Ay.</i>

She'll be fine.

Let her be.

She always gets up
after she falls.

I get up too, Mom.

Yes.

But you have always needed
a little assistance.

Why is it that you
can bury your past,

but I can't bury mine?

Lexita, I did not
bury my past.

I know exactly
where I came from.

That is why I have made
the choices that I have made.

Smart choices that have
gotten me right here.

I tried everything
to make you proud.

I kept up
an amazing facade for years.

But when the payoff
is waking up alone

because you've been living
your life for everybody else but yourself,

you start to realize
image is not everything.

Lexita.

Listen to me.
( scoffs )

<i>Listen to me.</i>

There was this one day
when I was walking

you and your sister
to Hebrew school.

And all of a sudden,
one of the mothers approached me.

She asked me
if I had my weekends free.

I didn't understand
what the question meant.

I thought that maybe
she was confusing me

for someone else
or that I was translating

incorrectly in my head.

So she quickly
rephrased the question.

"Need mula?

I -- no--
<i>Yo...</i> pay well.

<i>Mucho dinero."</i>

I don't remember that.

Of course you don't.
You were too young.

But I have
never forgotten.

Obviously, she thought
that I was your nanny

and not your mother.

So as far as I see it,

image is everything.

I'm gonna go
bring this to Kayla.

To my lovely wife.

<i>This is the best night</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

I love you, Lexi.

Ah!

Daniel and Alexis,
have a wonderful honeymoon.

<i>Bon voyage,</i>
<i>many great travels.</i>

All I'm saying is Lex,
seriously, consider your source.

The woman had to sacrifice
her pet lamb Cho Cho

when she was, like, eight
to help feed the family.

It was a goat.
Whatever, Lex.

I'm just saying look
at who you're dealing with

before you end up
losing your mind.

Oh.

Before I forget,
we have a meeting with Mikey

in, like, 20
at Comic Circuit. - ( groans )

So wash your mug
and giddyup, partner.

We gotta get
this party started.

Go, go--
â™ª Go. â™ª

Hey, Rob?

Yes,
I'm thinking about it.

I know the ceilings are low,
but she's freaking Filipino.

How much head room
could she possibly need?

Ah! The Justice League
of America.

Hi, Mikey.
Hey.

I got your stack
in the back.

Okay.
Gimme a sec.

No problem,
you take your time.

I'm not going anywhere.

Don't rush
on my account.

( giggles )

So cute.

Ew.
What?

Were you just flirting
with a 13-year-old?

He is 19.
He is a fetus.

You are creepy.
Perfectly legal.

I respected you
25 seconds ago. - He can vote, can't he?

Hey, the younger the berry--
Um, Demi.

I beg you not to finish
that sentence, "por favies."

What are we supposed
to be looking for anyway?

Inspiration.

Is this where you come
to find the nerd of your dreams?

Well, that depends.
Are you a nerd?

( laughs )
No. I don't know.

Actually,
maybe I didn't-- I'm not sure.

Well, that's too bad
'cause then my answer would've been yes.

Dad!
Look who I found!

Okay, what happened
last night

and who is this kid?

"The younger the berry..."
( gasps )

Okay, I am gonna go look
for Batman Issue 515.

I will be right back.

Um, there's no way
you would even know

anything about that issue,
so stay here.

Who are you?

Ahem.

So, uh...
<i>Can I take you out?</i>

I'd like
to take you somewhere.

Somewhere sounds great.

Tonight?

Make a few calls,
see if I can find a sitter.

No way, Hal Jordan
is a way better GL. - Um, wrong.

Kyle Rayner could
beat him hands down. - <i>You're insane.</i>

Bingo.

You owe me.

I know.

Big.
I know.

Ew.

Really? Ponytail?

It's not very sexy,
Lexi, I'm just--

But it's the only way
that I can get rid of my grays.

Or hair dye.

Dude, I don't have the money
to do regular upkeeps.

Oh, my God, because
the last time I checked,

Clairol was, like, $4.

Do I look desperate?
Yeah, a little bit.

Manufactured happiness
is not gonna get you laid.

Yeah, but it's definitely
gonna get me through tonight.

So you're, um--
you're a serial killer.

Well, serial killers
usually get paid more.

Mm-hmm.
Yeah, they got more lines.

They have ransoms to request,
threats to make,

and negotiations
to work out with the 5-0.

Fascinating.

I've never met a reenactment
actor before.

I-- you know,
I can't believe

that I'm sitting here
with the Green River Killer.

Kind of freaky.

So is that
your long story?

No, but it, uh--
it does lead into it.

I met my long story

playing Ted Bundy,

and she was cast
as one of my victims.

Hm.
It's pretty romantic, huh?

Very, very romantic.

So is this one of those,
like, to-be-continued

or tune-in-next-week
kind of stories?

No, no.

It's, uh--
it's a the-end kind of story.

It's over.

So, uh, does
she stay in L.A. to pursue the dream?

No, no.

She's, uh...
she's living the dream.

She's one of the biggest
<i>novella</i> stars out there.

She even managed
to make, uh...

"People <i>en Espanol"s</i>
<i>Top Ten Most Beautiful Women.</i>

Mm.

Um....
( sighs )

So that's-- I mean, that's--
that's really, uh...

Spooky.

( laughs nervously )

So, I mean,
if she's all that,

then why--
why with the divorce?

Well, exactly that.

She thought
she was all that,

and she wanted
an all-that kinda guy to be at her side.

And you're not
an all-that kinda guy?

Oh, sorry, I didn't
mean that like that.

I--
Mm... no, no.

It's all good.

Hey, you know,
I should call home

and check in on Memo.

Um...
Yeah.

Or relieve Memo.
Yeah, more like save Kayla.

Your story's next.

Oh, yeah,
I plead the Fifth.

Oh, yes,
there's no way in He--

hello there, buddy.
How you doin'?

But that's kind of you.

Thanks for the flowers.
Sure.

I didn't know you weren't
a fan of things that die.

Yeah, well, I'm working
on that, okay? ( laughs )

This is so beautiful.

So...

you win-- what do you want
to know about me?

Well, the drama.
Oh.

That's what
makes a good story. - Oh, well, of course.

( laughs )

I followed
my perfect husband

to California about
four years ago

for the perfect job as
the perfect entertainment lawyer

extraordinaire to the stars.

Uh, we were
high school sweethearts

voted "Most Likely to Live
Happily Ever After,"

and my parents...

absolutely adored him.

Wow.
Yep.

Pressure.
Mm!

( both laugh )

Yeah, you're telling me.

Um... you know,
on paper, he was ideal,

the perfect show dog.

Bring him in front
of the audience

and he's trained
and groomed.

And take him
behind stage,

and he bites and growls
like Cujo.

Well, Cujo eventually
got what was coming to him.

Yep.
So did Daniel.

Seriously?
Dude croaked?

Yep.

Not so happily-ever-after
after all.

Oh, man,
I'm so sorry.

You know...

I still don't know
what hurts more--

the fact
that the police report

listed his death as
"vehicular blowjob"

or the fact that I never got
to tell him to go to hell.

You know, it's just--
( groans )

Wow.

I asked for drama,
I sure got it.

( laughs )

You're welcome.

( laughs )

You know, as they say,

you know, let bygones
be bygones, right?

Yeah.

Tell my mother that.

Yeah, we should
probably go, right?

It's getting really late
and I have to wake up

early in the morning,
and I have to go meet

this old associate
to nail a chimp.

Nail down a chimp-- nail down
a chimp is what I meant.

You know?

Not to mention
that I don't have a DJ

or a photographer
or a superhero to save my life.

Well, we can get Louie
to DJ for you.

The guy owes me big,
I mean, he's got a bar bill

he'll never be able
to pay off.

Really?
Yeah.

'Cause, I mean,
that would be awesome.

And I-- I may not be
a professional photographer

or anything,
but I've taken

my fair share of pictures
over the years

of, you know,
Memo and his pals.

Like, I could do that
for you if you want.

What's the catch?

Just a second date.

Kayla:
<i>Are you kidding me?</i> <i>You didn't get to second base?</i>

Can't say that I'm jealous.
Oh, you should be.

Why? My night
consisted of dwarfs,

princesses, warriors...
Lucky Charms.

Hot.
Oh.

What?
Maybe it was the grays

that kept you from getting
to second base.

( laughs )

Oh.

She must've
thrown in the towel.

Um, well,
I'm gonna go to bed.

It's late,
you coming up?

You know, I'm gonna--

actually, I'm gonna
get a snack.

Didn't you just eat?

Uh, no.

It was a first date,
you don't eat on the first date.

Wow, it's been
that long?

Must've forgotten
the rules.

All right,
I love you.

Don't stay up
too late, please.

Love you.

Is she still
as annoying as ever?

Shh!
<i>( monkey grunting )</i>

You only think
that she's annoying

because she hit on you
that one time.

One time.
Yeah, one time.

( scoffs )

Look, the bottom line
is is that we need a monkey ASAP.

Blue... monkey.

Right, a blue monkey.

So if that means
sucking up her advances

and, you know, fulfilling
that promise you made

to that little girl,
then I say you need

to buck up
and take one for the team.

Buck up?
Buck up.

I'm not leaving here
without a deal.

Says the pimp.

Ladies.

Oh, you look fabulous
for a widow.

Oh.

And you.

Yeah, I need to--
I'm just-- it's important.

Still like a giant
kangaroo rat--

small and cute,
but completely unavailable

due to your
endangered status. - And you--

I am so excited to see
what you picked out for us.

Aren't we, sis?
Please, after you.

Awesome.

And after you.

Case, hold
all my calls, please.

So I've got
some real cute ones.

Oh, thanks,
let's see.

Oh, wait, I didn't know
you did "Babe."

I saw
the poster out there.

You did?
Oh, honey.

I only do babes.

Oh, yeah,
this is not gonna work.

This is light blue, Gleek
is more of a... royal blue.

Yeah, Jude,
when I said blue,

I meant totally blue,
not just the balls.

Well, tall order.

Small budgets
gets you this.

Unless you'd like
to barter a deal.

A deal?
Oh, God.

I'm gonna be honest, Jude--
I mean,

I really just don't have
anything to offer in return.

They have such
a tight budget,

and she has me, like,
right by them too, you know?

Oh, what?

Me?
Just a thought.

Well, like a date?

Like, just the two
of you?

I don't see
how one drink could hurt. - Oh.

( laughs )
I love that you haven't lost your professionalism.

Now, you're
making me blush.

Um... you know what?

I need to see you
for a minute.

Or two.
Oh. I'll be right back.

Like now?

I'm not getting traded
for a monkey.

I was kidding
when I called you a pimp.

It's just one drink,
all right?

Jude is a scary,
hungry woman,

and I'm not going
anywhere with her. The end.

You're gonna have to
tell her that we need to work out another deal.

I can't.
Why? Why can't you?

Because we need this.

Fine,
because I need this.

Man, Lexi,
Mom was right.

You've given up.

Excuse me?
Mm-mm.

No, get back--
where are you going?

I honestly, honestly think
that you need to do this on your own.

Wait, are you in cahoots
with Mom or something?

No, I am--
This is not like you.

I am bailing because
I'm not a carpet muncher

and I'm not gonna be traded
for some blue-balled monkey.

( muttering )
I cannot talk-- what are you doing?

I'm gonna say--
Carpet muncher?

Really?
How phobic of you.

You know what, Lex?
I'm thinking this isn't going to work out.

I prefer to work
with professionals only.

Wait, wha--
( stammering )

But you just said
that you loved my professionalism.

We smiled.
Yeah, I did,

but that was before
I was referred to as a muncher.

Oh, like I'm really
that far off.

Can I just--

do you remember when I wanted
to quit real estate classes what you said to me?

You said that
you can't fail if you finish.

I stole that
from a self-help video.

Whatever, Lexi, damn,
I'm just saying

that you can't
let Daniel, and Mom,

and your fucking insecurities
dictate your life.

Ladies, I hate
to do this,

but if you could take your
after-school special outside,

that would be great.

I'm trying to conduct
a business here.

Lex...
<i>Thank you.</i>

By the way,
I'm not phobic.

I just prefer brunettes.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

Excuse me.

Um, question.

Is this animal-safe?

It's not tested on animals,
if that's what you mean.

Yeah, I get that--

I'm asking if you can
use it on animals.

I don't know.

Really helpful,
you can just begin--

you can just package
all that up right there.

<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

Hello?
Alexis.

Uh, hi, this is
Mrs. Wasserstein,

and I am calling
with some bad--

some awful news.

Apparently, my very
defiant daughter

<i>has taken it</i>
<i>upon herself to cancel</i>

<i>her very own Bat Mitzvah.</i>

Wait, wait, wait,
what, why? Why?

<i>She, uh, has</i>
<i>made up her mind,</i>

and is adamant about
wearing a dress

that I feel is
completely inappropriate

for a young lady to wear
on such a special occasion.

Well, and-- like, maybe
if I can talk to her, I can--

<i>Oh, she won't listen</i>
<i>to anybody.</i>

Oh.
Inappropriate?

As if she thinks
I have fat knees

and she doesn't
want to be embarrassed

in front of all her friends.

Give me that!

Uh...

okay, well, then, I guess
I just have some calls to make,

and... good luck
to you and Shari.

Yes, well, that's why
we're in therapy together.

Best of luck to you
as well.

<i>( siren wailing )</i>

<i>( doorbell buzzes )</i>

( knocks on door )

Memo:
Hold your horses! I'm coming!

<i>Hey, buddy.</i>
<i>- Hey, Alexis.</i>

Um, is my dad expecting you
or something?

Uh, no.

I just was in
the neighborhood, and I needed some milk.

Okay.

Well, he's in
his office, so...

Okay, great, thanks.

Now, I gotta get back to kicking
some Grand Theft butt!

Awesome.

Woman:
<i>I've waited too long for us</i> <i>to be together again.</i>

<i>What happened</i>
<i>to the passion,</i>

<i>our dreams,</i>
<i>our love for each other?</i>

I can't afford to get myself
wrapped up again

in all of your drama.

Look, you know
I'll always have

<i>a special place</i>
<i>in my heart for you.</i>

<i>But with everything</i>
<i>that's happened, I can't</i> <i>take that risk.</i>

But you promised.

You said that if I could
figure out a way

to get rid of James,
then our lives would change,

<i>and I did.</i>

<i>I did what you asked</i>
<i>of me.</i>

What more do
you want from me?

Nothing!

That's just it.

Are you really going
to say no to me?

Look at what
I'm offering you.

Oh...

Hey, you.

I didn't know
you were dropping by.

Uh, yeah, I, um--
I tried calling.

Yeah, my-- my phone
is in the charger.

<i>Yeah, we were just--</i>
<i>- You know what?</i>

I'm actually--
I'm gonna go.

I'm gonna go
because I have to go.

Um, but it was nice
meeting you.

I don't think
we actually met.

You are...

Leaving.

( speaks Spanish )

You must've missed
the cash-for-clunkers program.

You could've traded that one in
for some good pocket change.

Do not do that.
Do what?

Tell the truth?

( scoffs )

Dad?

Hey.
Baby girl, you okay?

I don't know.

I'm sorry I pulled you
out of your meeting.

No worries, I already know
the hidden truth behind the hidden tooth.

And to be perfectly honest,
you saved me

from having to drive
Stan Krieger back to Jersey.

So... talk to me, Lexi.

What's got your feathers
all ruffled up?

The Bat Mitzvah's off.

Oh, no.

Oh, I'm so sorry, Lexi.

I honestly don't know
what to do anymore, Dad.

What happened?

Mrs. Wasserstein
is set on torturing

and controlling her daughter
for the rest of her life.

Okay, then.

What about Shari?

She's not talking
to anyone.

I don't-- I don't even
know what I would say to her if I could.

Well, you could say
that she's missing out

on a really big thing
in life.

It's really a big deal

and that there's nothing
worse than regret.

And you also could
tell her you have a mom.

You understand
her frustrations.

You could tell her
that it's all going

to work itself out
in the end.

It always does, Lexi.

You know that, right?

Yeah.

Now sometimes,
you have to fight the fight

to get what you want.

You want it?
I do.

Then go and get it.

You've done it before.

And remember--
the Fish family are not quitters.

Now, we tend
to come in last a lot,

but we do not quit.

Talk to Shari.

I really think
this will be a good thing for the both of you.

You're probably right.
I am.

And you know,
it won't hurt for you

to talk to
your own mom too.

Tell her the truth
about Daniel--

Dad... Dad.

She deserves to know.

Give her the benefit
of the doubt, Lexi.

You know,
she does mean well.

It just sometimes
comes across

in a lovingly
brutal way, you know?

Is it even worth
the risk?

Yeah, everything in life
is worth the risk.

It's just up to you
to figure out

if it's important enough
for you to take it.

( sniffles )

Yeah,
I guess you're right.

I am.

<i>( music playing )</i>

Hey.
Mm.

Good morning.
Where's Dad?

At the store.

Those look gross.

Oh, no.

( speaks Spanish )

Liliana's about to seduce
her husband's killer.

( speaks Spanish )

No, Mom, please not today,
not today, please not today.

I wasn't going
to say anything,

but please, just put
my show back on.

Look at her.

<i>( speaks Spanish )</i>

<i>She's perfect.</i>

<i>I bet you she never</i>
<i>goes out of the house</i>

   <i>without her makeup on.</i>
<i>- She doesn't.</i>

So your father tells me
that the Bat Mitzvah

has been cancelled--
what happened?

Shari's mom wants her
to get another dress,

but Shari refuses, so...

And that's it?
It's just about a dress?

So why doesn't Shari
just listen

to what her mother asks
and pick another dress?

I don't know,
she's a pre-teen.

They never listen
to their mothers.

It's not just
the pre-teens, <i>hija.</i>

Anyway...

I thought maybe
I'd go over there today

and try to convince her
to get the party back on. You know?

I don't want her
to miss her Bat Mitzvah. It'd suck.

I don't think
it's your place to interfere

with a mother
and her child.

As I have always said,

no one knows
what's in the chicken soup

except the chicken
and the chef.

The one thing
I agree with you on, Mom.

Well, then let it be.

Let those two figure out
what their differences are

before you stick your beak
into their business.

Easier said than done,
don't you think?

Nobody likes
a sticky beak, Lexita.

Let them worry about
their problems,

and you worry
about yours.

Well...

if that's the way
you feel,

then I've been meaning
to talk to you about something.

Oh, oh, no, no,
<i>un momento,</i> please.

Uh, you know what?
That's-- that's no worries.

No, no, no-- oh, please,
Lexit<i>mira.</i>

It's just that I have
been waiting

so long for this moment--

Tell me about it.

Okay, I'm sorry, sit down.

Talk to me-- what is it
you want to tell me?

Okay.
Ahem.

All right, okay.

In going with your-- Mom.
What?

In using your analogy
with the soup to the chef...

I was the chef,

and Daniel was the big,
fat, cheating chicken.

Lexita.

You know you never
speak ill of the dead.

You know better than that.
Speak ill?

I'm-- I'm trying to tell you
that he made himself out

to be something
that he wasn't.

Smoke and mirrors, Mom.

He cheated,
lied about everything, okay?

He lied about our savings.

he lied about
his successful business.

When he died,
he left me with nothing.

Absolutely nothing.

$4 hair dye.

Well, regardless,

you never talk about someone
who cannot defend themselves.

Okay, see, I knew
this was a bad idea.

Somehow, you would spin it
around on me,

but so much for
the mother and daughter talk.

I'm just hoping
that Mrs. Wasserstein

isn't as closed-minded
as you

or else Shari
is screwed for life.

( sighs )

It was a risk,
but at least you tried.

Alexis:
I told you, Dad.

( chatter )

Hey! Hey!
Weird! Right?

What are you doing here?

Hey, look, I'm not
the enemy, all right?

I mean, I know you don't
wanna talk to your mom, but you could talk to me.

Sorry, I just don't
wanna talk about it, okay?

Totally.

Totally, I get it.

Um... so, uh--

so I saw
that you got a number.

Huh?
What?

Well, that boy
over there, and--

and I saw him
pass you a note.

I-- I assumed
it was digits.

Sorry.

Are you stalking me?

No! Oh, God, no!
No, no, no! No need to run!

Look, I mean,
I was running before. That's why I'm so sweaty.

I was just doing a jog,
and, you know, poof! Here you were.

So... yeah.

Okay, well,
good seeing you, I guess.

Well, I mean,
seeing that we're here,

you might as well
show me that mysterious, taboo dress of yours.

Look, I get what
you're trying to do,

but there's no way you're gonna
get me to change my mind.

My mom and I won't
even agree to disagree,

and that's just the way
it is.

I'm so not going
to lose sleep over it.

Oh, wait, but you will.

Eventually--
I mean, it's just years.

I'm not sleeping, so--

look, you don't even
have to try it on.

I was going
to return it tomorrow,

but it sure is pretty.

I guess I can
show it to you.

Great, awesome, yay.

( gasps )

It's so pretty.

You think?
Yes.

Oh, it would be a shame
not to wear it.

I mean, at least once,

in front of
all your best friends.

Just think about how crazy
jealous they'd be.

They'd be insanely jealous.

I know.

You gotta try it on,
you must.

<i>Yeah.</i>

Just like my sister.

( chuckles )

( gasps )

Total "Princess Diaries."

Turn.

Yeah.

I love it.

Uh, what--
what happened?

Hey, no, no, no, no,
what happened?

No... what happened?

What happened to the happy?
We were so happy?

I don't know.

I just don't wanna spend
the entire night

worrying about what
my mother is spending

the entire night
worrying about.

You know what I mean?

I wish I didn't,
but I do, kiddo.

I mean, I would have
chosen another dress,

but I really like
this one.

That's because it's perfect.

And, um...

maybe we can just adjust it
to make your mother happy.

Not likely.

Woo-hoo, Shari, I'm back
from my Botox luncheon!

Would you get
that look off your face?

You look more surprised
than I do.

( sighs )
Shari, I thought we discussed that dress.

Now, go take it off.

I think she looks
awesome in it.

Well, have you taken
a gander at her knees?

I mean, please,
let's be honest.

Mrs. Wasserstein,
with all due respect,

she's your daughter.

Oh, I'm aware.

37 hours in labor,
four hours tummy tucking.

It's not something
you forget that quickly. I'm just saying.

I thought she was adopted.

What?
( laughs )

I said "labor."

I meant "laser."

I had a little laser
freshening up.

You know,
I wanted to be fabulous

for the unveiling
of the baby.

Right.

Did you ever stop to think
that maybe she's okay with the way she looks?

Alexis, she's a teenager.
They're never okay with the way they look

<i>and some of them</i>
<i>for good reason.</i>

You know,
I'm not one to stick my beak

where it doesn't belong,
but you can quite possibly

be making it worse by calling
attention to her shortcomings.

( laughs )
Alexis, it's obvious that you're not a mom.

Do you have any idea
what it's like for the--

for the teenagers of today,
for the kids of today

with all
the bullying going on?

Well, mothers can be
bullies too.

( sighs )
Alexis, I am just trying to prepare her

for the real world
in my way.

It's called
good parenting.

Okay.
If I may.

This could possibly be
the lowest point in my life.

But, I am begging you,
begging you, to let her wear that dress.

I mean, she likes it,
okay?

<i>She wants it,</i>
<i>she's happy in it.</i>

Before you walked in,
she was spinning!

And not to mention,

I really need
this to happen.

I can't go back to L.A.,
I have absolutely nothing left there for me.

I know, I know I'm not
a mother, but I have one.

And I will bet just
about anything

that all she wants is a
little love and approval.

So, what do you say, huh?

Please?

My dear Alexis,

I had no idea you
were this damaged.

Ooh!

Don't take this
moment away from her.

Okay, over a dress?

I promise you
it's not worth it.

Oh, for Pete's sake.

Listen.

I think what you really
need to concentrate on

is getting laid.

Because it is a much
more rewarding release

than sticking your beak
into other people's business.

What if I added some
ruffles around the trim?

It will cover my knees,
and that way, it's a win-win for all of us.

Yes! Boom!
Yeah!

They're just knees.

Good thinking,
yes!

Yeah, and anyway,
you've gotta feel good

about the fact that
they don't come from your side of the family.

( sighs )
Well...

that might make me feel
a little bit better.

I don't know,
I don't know, I don't know.

I will consider it.

Okay?

So, we're back on?

I can keep planning?

Yeah, but don't
think for one second

that if I didn't
have more time,

you wouldn't
be replaced.

I'm late.

Of course,
noted!

<i>( squealing )</i>

â™ª You're gonna have
a Bat Mitzvah â™ª

â™ª You're gonna
have a Bat Mitzvah. â™ª

All right, so,

I know it doesn't
look like much now,

but just add balloons,
centerpieces,

superheroes,
lights, music.

This is all wrong,
awful.

<i>â™ª The curtains</i>

â™ª We will swipe your

â™ª 'Cause we're

Come in.

Your father
let me in.

I'm sorry
I'm so late,

I tried to close
down early.

Still not a fan.

Right.

Ahem. Well, um...

so, you know
how they say

that there are those people
who star in your life,

and those that are
just background extras?

No.

Oh.

Well, that's what
they say.

But, what I'm
trying to say

is that my ex is--
is just that.

An extra,
in the background,

like-- like noise.

Dead air,
to be exact.

Okay, yeah, well, she did
not look like dead air.

She looked quite alive
and comfortable

<i>in her spandex.</i>
<i>- Yeah, about that.</i>

She's shooting a film,

and she offered
me a crumb.

Which, I might add,
I'm not biting.

Because I'm honestly
done with all that.

I'm not looking to make
a sequel of that drama.

Really?
'Cause, um,

what was all that talk
about her leaving Jason,

you know, and you guys
getting back together?

It's just acting.

Just running lines,
that's it.

She wanted me to
audition for this role

'cause she thought it might
get me back in the game.

And for a nanosecond,
I thought,

I might still want it.

The acting,
that is.

But-- but I don't.

And that's where
you come in.

Really?

Yeah,
it's weird.

But, for some reason,

not knowing you
a whole lot

doesn't matter.

'Cause you just fit the part,
you know what I'm saying?

No.

I never really
fit the part.

Probably why I got kicked
out of Hebrew school.

Well, that, and punching
Jessica Katz in the throat

for saying I was
adopted from Vietnam.

I gave it to her good.
Were you?

( sighs )

And, they're fake.

Well, at least
they don't die.

Just need a little dusting
from time to time.

Yeah, well,
I don't dust. - I do.

Do you?
Mm-hmm.

( whispering )
Are you gonna kiss me? - Mm-hmm.

Okay, well, then,
I think you should.

Oh, lovely,
thank you so much.

Da-da-da-da!
( gasps ) You look amazing.

Oh, my God,
thank you!

Getting it together!

I know, even though clearly
this is a knock off.

All right, tall order,
small budget.

This is what you get.
Thank you, Jude.

Regardless, do not spill
anything on it, okay?

'Cause it's rental.
Damn it, I knew it!

Hey, will you do
me a favor and just

hold down the floor
for a second?

I gotta handle something,
I'll be right back.

You know it.
All right, thank you.

By the way,
looking pretty sexy Lexi today.

Stop it.

See, if Superman could
come back from the dead, so could you.

That wasn't--
That's a compliment.

Didn't feel like one.
It is a compliment!

Mm!
Mm!

I would compliment that.
Any time you like.

Louis...

I need to go
save some lives.

( exhales sharply )

I can do this.

<i>( door opens )</i>

I wish you would
have told me sooner.

Did Dad send you?

No.

I came to talk
on my own.

Why didn't you
tell me the truth?

And surrender my pride?

I should have known
something was wrong

with your marriage
when you started

gaining all that weight.

I'm gonna assume that
that came from a good place.

<i>Ay mija.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>

I never meant for you
to question that.

( sighs )
<i>Mira</i>    Lexita, I--

maybe I didn't give
you the guidance

and the support
that you wanted.

But, I-- I gave you
what I knew how to give.

( speaks Spanish )

I know, Mom.

( sighs )

You look beautiful.

You think so?
I know so.

Good luck
out there.

( sighs )

Ooh.

All right, so...

okay, let's scooch in
a little over here.

Starman, if you come up
a little bit, thank you.

Okay, ready?

Very nice, very nice.

Nice Yamaka.

Thank you.

You guys look
incredible.

Thanks.

You look pretty
good yourself.

Thank you.

You do
clean up well.

Oh, that was a
little backhanded,

but I'll take it
from you.

Do you wanna come with
me to the loading dock

to pick up our
guest of honor, please?

Sure, sure.

Hey Memo, I'll be back
in just a minute.

Best behavior, yeah?

Okay.
All right.

You're it.
No tag backs.

...right around
the corner, but--

Oh!

Yeah, so, Casey sends
her sincerest apologies.

But, the monkey she
booked for you guys

got booked to play
Abu in "Aladdin".

On Broadway, hm.

So, she sent Mookie
to take his place.

I'll be back at
5:00 to pick him up.

Okay, uh, Mookie's
not a monkey.

Oh, what makes
you say that?

He's not a monkey,
but he's, uh...

he's cute.

<i>I like his</i>
<i>little cape.</i>

<i>( Alexis sighs )</i>

That man was
kinda creepy, right?

Yeah, definitely creepy.
Yeah?

Okay.
Fat chance.

Ta-da!

Ta-da,
not a monkey!

All right, tall order,
small budget.

This is what you get.
Yeah, yeah.

You get a small
South American rodent.

You know, I really don't
think Shari will be able to tell the difference.

Oh, isn't he cute?
But it does not take a rocket scientist

to see that is
definitely not a monkey.

Memo:
Not a monkey at all.

Oh, my God.
Monkey!

Mom, look!
He's awesome!

You guys rock.

You totally
saved my day.

That's what we
are here for.

Oh!
Oh, Lord, Lord!

You got him?

There you go.
Mm!

Okay.
All right!

So, maybe she's in
special ed.

That, we're not
gonna say again.

Oh.
You know, maybe I should

go and take some pictures
of her with the rodent.

All right,
just, ahem,

photograph her
from the waist up.

Just go waist up.

( laughing )

Alexis:
Awesome.

Nice job.

I see you took a little
bit of my advice

and got yourself
a piece of man candy.

Oh!
Bravo!

Excuse me, honey,

but can you escort
me to the latrine?

I may need
your assistance.

( laughs )

Whee!

And suddenly,
it's all so clear.

Like a crystal.

Whatever.

<i>( music playing )</i>

Precious.

Photography,
waist up.

Lookie, lookie!

What do you have here?

Did you get a number
at a Bat Mitzvah?

Ew!

That costume must really
be working for you.

No, woman,
it is for you!

That woman on table 20
wants you to call her

about her husband's
surprise 60th birthday party!

Whoop whoop!
Get it, get it.

No, burn it!

What, the number?
Never.

Hey, hey, hey!

To all the love birds
in the house,

I got this
oldie-but-goodie for ya.

( laughs )

No, no, no.
You owe me.

( stammering )

<i>â™ª Thinking about you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Oh, you waited so long... â™ª</i>

Oh, you know what?

( camera clicks )

Nice, that was
a great shot, thank you.

No, thank you.

<i>â™ª You tried to open my eyes â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Like a brand new day... â™ª</i>

( whispering )

Are you?
Yeah, look at that.

Oh, oh!

Oh, my goodness,
I never knew.

Whoa!

Look at that,
what a prize, huh?

Take care,
thanks for coming.

Here you go, honey.

You trying to steal
one of my gift bags?

You hungry?

Well, where did
Memo go?

The babysitter
just picked him up.

Yeah, I'm starving.

Great.

After you.

Okay.

Ah, that was a
successful day, huh?

Rodent and all.

You think?

You know, it's all
about perception.

If you think it is,
then it is.

( sighs )

I think it
was amazing.

It was good, right?

Mm-hmm.

Mm!

Yummy!

A woman's heart,
you know the way.

Cheesy goodness, mm.

I knew it.

I haven't had
a slider in ages.

Why, why would you
deprive yourself?

( sniffs )
Mm.

I guess I--
I don't know.

I guess I got
used to, uh,

not giving myself the good
things in life, you know?

And now?

I guess I can
change my flight.

That's a good
start, right?

It's a great start.

<i>( music playing )</i>

<i>â™ª Don't wanna go back â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To where I started â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not when</i>
<i>I've come this far â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Yeah, I was worn down â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I had it all wrong â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Sinking deep into you â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To hide from me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The struggle with</i>
<i>what I see â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And what I choose</i>
<i>to make of it â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Comes down to</i>
<i>this one thing â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª My life can't change â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª If I stay stuck</i>
<i>in yesterday â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So I'm getting</i>
<i>out of my own way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I remind myself</i>
<i>again and again â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I'm getting out</i>
<i>of my own way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm learning to trust</i>
<i>these curvy roads â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª More than the straight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't dare</i>
<i>drink that bar dry â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And then leave me</i>
<i>all messed up like that â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And say there's</i>
<i>nothing wrong â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm done with this game â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Find someone else â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Don't try to</i>
<i>convince me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª With your</i>
<i>warped reality, yeah â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I've had my reasons â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª To believe</i>
<i>I could love enough â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª For both you and me</i>
<i>frozen in fantasy â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª The lies</i>
<i>keep taunting me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I can barely breath â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So I'm getting</i>
<i>out of my own way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I remind myself</i>
<i>again and again â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And I'm getting out</i>
<i>of my own way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm learning to trust</i>
<i>these curvy roads â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª More than the straight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Whoa â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Whoa â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª And now I'm saying â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Exactly what I mean â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I can't let fear</i>
<i>control me â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Anymore â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not anymore â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not anymore â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Not anymore â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause I'm getting</i>
<i>out of my own way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Dumping all baggage</i>
<i>down the drain â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª Making room</i>
<i>for a brand new day â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm learning to trust</i>
<i>these curvy roads â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª More than the straight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª So I'm getting</i>
<i>out of my own way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I remind myself</i>
<i>again and again â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm getting out</i>
<i>of my own way â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª I'm learning to trust</i>
<i>these curvy roads â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª More than the straight â™ª</i>

<i>â™ª 'Cause it's</i>
