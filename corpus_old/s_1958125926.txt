I told you a zillion times.

Keep the strap tight.

But you never listen.

Teddy, you're not that old, don't nag.

Web!

Nothing must go wrong.

I know.

Hey, UG Brothers!

Are you ready?

Over 1 million viewers will be online.

All systems go. Catch!

Right time, right place, right person.

Everything is perfect.

This is a livecast online,

we'll be famous.

You bet! With our technology.

Cool?

Too cool.

You too.

Stop horsing around.

Syndra, bring up 
the simulated preview.

Let's go.

Look!

Web, open the parachute 
when you drop to 200m.

The train is moving in high speed,

I'll mark my time and land on it.

You must be careful.

I will.

Enjoy the ride.

Leave the rest to us.

OK!

No problem.

Cut it out!

Let's get to work.

I'll go.

JJ, cut it out!

What's that?

The eye in the sky.

My masterpiece.

Be careful! 
The livecast depends on this baby.

No sweat!

<i>How do you feel, buddy?</i>

<i>Super!</i>

<i>Like Batmanâ€¦</i>

More like Superman.

Visual and audio looks good.

But thenâ€¦

you'll run 
into rising warm air current.

Teddy, the viewers online

have exceeded 1 million.

<i>We'll be a sensation!</i>

JJ!

Don't lose them.

This is the most valuable moment.

Roger!

Go, baby!

The current has changed, Teddy.

<i>We have crosswind.</i>

<i>Open the parachute! Hurry!</i>

Give it up! 
The air current is too strong.

Too late! He's too close to the train.

Teddy!

Teddy!

You must land on the top of the train.

Are you mad?

He has no other choice.

If he opens the parachute now

everything goes down the drain.

<i>I will land on the train.</i>

Teddy!

Teddy!

Teddy!

Syndra!

You gave me your word!

Youâ€¦

Mom!

Dad!

I was wrong.

<i>Web, come home.</i>

<i>Don't break Mom's heart anymore.</i>

<i>Web!</i>

<i>Call me back.</i>

<i>Web, I know you feel awful, me too.</i>

<i>We need to talk.</i>

<i>Where are you, Web?</i>

<i>Come home.</i>

<i>Mom missed you.</i>

<i>Web, our channel is hot!</i>

<i>UG is hot!</i>

<i>We're getting all the attention.</i>

<i>Here's our chance to get rich.</i>

<i>Hurry up and call me back.</i>

Urban Game is here.

This year we're taking you 
to experience what real adventure is.

the exciting Ninja Warrior,

and the ever so thrilling 
Dive of Death.

We'll let you feel 
your heart beating crazy fast

and we'll get your blood rushing 
through your veins.

We also have a mysterious final game.

Curious now? Join me and dig it

Urban Games Bloody Awesome!

-Sorry!
-What the hellâ€¦

<i>When will you get here?</i>

<i>Soon, I'm on my way.</i>

<i>You just left? 
There's a traffic jam on your end.</i>

<i>Relax! I can fly.</i>

You'll get me in trouble.

The professor found out

I'm letting someone use the lab.

I can only wait for you till 6.

Hurry! I'm leaving
if you're not here by then.

Here I am!

I set up the camera for you already.

You just need to 
put in the tracking device.

You can't use the lab anymore.

Don't worry, this is the last time.

-You must wrap it up tonight.
-This is it.

-Thanks.
-Don't forget to lock up.

Tyler!

How dare you show your face!

Teddy, I came to see you.

Don't be such a hypocrite.

You have such a sharp tongue.

Look at this, buddy.

Why are you showing me this?

Webâ€¦

I only want you to know

UG is hot because of you and Teddy.

You should be proud of yourselves.

My brother is dead,

there's nothing to be proud of.

Web,

I'm sorry about Teddy.

It was an accident,

and it was over now.

He invented urban games

you shouldn't
let his baby go to waste.

You're right.

Everthing is over now.

Don't ever look me up again.

No, Webâ€¦

You belong to this world.

You should come back, 
come away with me.

Do you realize

UG is not the same anymore?

It's up and coming.

Trust me, we can do wonders.

I'll take you to a competition.

I even bought your plane ticket.

I'm not interested in UG.

You should leave.

No matter what I say,

you won't come back.

Is that right?

Your brother
would have died for nothing.

I'll level with you,

UG can make us a lot of money.

We'll be filthy rich, get it?

Listen to me,

my brother Teddy is dead

because of your dream to get rich.

Get out!

Out!

You don't understand,

we can't say no.

Out!

You'll be sorry!

Mom!

Web, you're home!

It's OK!

I missed you so much.

Don't worry.

Where's Syndra?

She hasn't been home for 3 days.

She didn't even bother to call.

Nothing.

Not a word.

This childâ€¦

Don't worry, 
I'll go up and take a look.

<i>Hello? Who's this?</i>

Where have you been?

Mom is worried sick about you.

<i>You've been had!</i>

<i>This is a recording.</i>

<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

What game are you playing?

Give Mom a call.

Hello?

<i>Web!</i>

<i>Looking for Syndra?</i>

Tyler!

<i>Do as I say and nobody gets hurt.</i>

Where's my sister?

Don't call the cops or
I can't guarantee

what will happen next.

<i>It's not something you want to see.</i>

Tyler!

Tyler!

<i>-Let go of me!
-Get in!</i>

<i>Let me out, jerk!</i>

<i>Let me out!</i>

Open the door!

Let me out!

<i>Let me out!</i>

Hey!

Tyler!

She's your girlfriend, 
what do you want?

<i>A smart guy like you 
should know what to do.</i>

Tyler Lee, I swear

if you lay a finger on her

I'll break your damn legs.

Web!

What happened?

Nothing.

Mom, I'm going to find Syndra.

Don't worry.

Fresh orangesâ€¦

<i>Hello?</i>

Welcome to Seoul.

<i>-Where's my sister?</i>
-Calm down!

She'll be fine if you do as I say.

<i>Look across the street.</i>

<i>Follow them.</i>

What game are you playing?

<i>Don't lose them.</i>

Cut the crap and let her go.

<i>You must join a competition.</i>

Tyler, you jerk!

What competition?

Tyler!

You're with Tyler?

You know Tyler?

Then you must know we're UG.

Where is he?

You have a lot of nerve

starting trouble over here.

Find him yourself!

Wait!

Have you seen a girl called Syndra?

They announced 
the venue of the competition!

Let's go take a look!

Are you crazy?

Sorry!

Lunatic!

Someone beat us here.

Awesome!

Syndra?

Fee, that's cheating.

You were hiding in here.

You were too slow.

How did you get in here?

You have no right to ask me.

He's so cocky!

<i>Welcome to the 2013 Urban Games.</i>

<i>I'd like to present</i>

<i>this year's UG girl</i>

<i>Maja!</i>

She's pretty!

<i>Let's all take a good lookâ€¦</i>

<i>at the contestants.</i>

<i>This is a game for the brave,</i>

<i>who are up for a challenge</i>

<i>and not afraid of hardship.</i>

<i>We have prepared for the winner</i>

<i>an award of $100,000 USD.</i>

Tyler Lee!

Come out here, jerk!

Where's my sister?

<i>Everyoneâ€¦</i>

<i>Do you know him?</i>

He's Web Zhang.

The biggest name 
in the UG Hall of Fame

Teddy Zhang's brother.

Teddy Zhang's brother 
is a UG celebrity.

<i>Yes, the Teddy Zhang,</i>

<i>who invented that daring dive.</i>

<i>Because of him</i>

<i>UG is what it is today.</i>

Urban Games

Cut the crap!

-Let my sister go!
-Web.

Watch out

-or I'llâ€¦
-<i>Web!</i>

<i>Remember what I told you.</i>

<i>Or elseâ€¦</i>

Listen up, everyone.

You know the rules

The game is about to begin.

Watch you phones.

Get started once you get the message.

Hey, buddy!

There'll be UG activities

want to join in?

We'll see.

Listenâ€¦

to save Syndra, do as Tyler say.

That's mine.

JJ?

Web!

What are you doing here?

I work here.

You're with Tyler?

He kidnapped my sister.

Are you with him?

Kidnap? What kidnap?

Tyler? No way!

You didn't know 
he kidnapped my sister?

Web.

I just work here.

Where is he?

Why did he make me
join this competition?

I really don't know.

I haven't seen Tyler in a long time.

He's not the same anymore.

JJ!

I need your help to find him.

I must save Syndra.

Noâ€¦

You don't know what you're up against.

Don't mess with them.

Trust me.

Tell him

I won't let him off the hook.

You seem upset, buddy.

What's with this competition?

You don't know?

Beanie, tell him the rules.

Tyler and Maja

pick the contestants for each round.

After 3 rounds, we have 4 finalists.

The winner takes home the prize money

and gets Maja.

Get it?

You want in?

The competition

I'm in,

as long as I can find Tyler.

You know him well?

Not at all.
Ask Fee to find out.

She came with Tyler.

She wasn't one of us.

What does she do?

Hard to say.

She has a bookstore nearby.

How about a game?

Snooker? You go ahead.

Hey!

<i>What are you looking for, Web?</i>

I don't know what you mean.

You haven't been listening.

<i>Don't tell me you're taking a walk.</i>

You put me under surveillance?

<i>Let me talk to my sister,</i>

or I won't sign up for the compeition.

Fine! I'll let you talk to Syndra.

<i>But you must finish the competition</i>

<i>before I can guarantee her safety.</i>

Or else even I can't help you.

<i>Syndra, guess who's here.</i>

Who are you? Let me out!

Syndra, it's me.

Web?

Web?

<i>Is that you?</i>

<i>Where are you?</i>

Can you hear me?

Are you alright?

Are you hurt?

<i>No, Web.</i>

<i>Get me out.</i>

Do you know

Tyler is behind this?

Web!

Web!

Syndra!

Syndra!

Tyler!

Happy now?

Syndra's safety

<i>depends on you.</i>

If you win, you'll get her back.

Tyler Lee!

If my sister so much as loses a hair,
I willâ€¦

If you listened to me
in the first place

<i>none of this would have happened.</i>

There's no turning back for us.

You must finish the competition.

<i>Do we have a deal?</i>

I'll do it

<i>on one condition.</i>

No harm must come to my sister.

Welcome back, Web.

You will turn UG into a frenzy.

It's alright, Grandpa. I'll do it.

What are you doing here?

Just browsing.

Let me help you.

Don't worry.

I'll do it.

You can go.

Long time no see.

Long time no see.

Coke.

Look who's here.

Are you ready?

Why wouldn't I be?

<i>The exciting moment is upon us.</i>

<i>Allow me to introduce</i>

<i>the Ninja Warriors</i>

<i>of the first round.</i>

<i>The rules are simple.</i>

<i>The minute the contestants jump down,</i>

<i>we don't care how they do it,</i>

<i>the first person to go through
the UG obstacle</i>

<i>and lands on top of the container</i>

<i>is the winner.</i>

<i>He can claim 
the prize money of $10,000 USD</i>

<i>and enter the next round.</i>

<i>Maja,</i>

<i>over to you.</i>

Lancelot!

He's likely to win,

because he's a brilliant rock climber.

Red!

She's trained in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu

and she's quite good.

How does she know who to pick?

She seems to be taking orders 
from someone.

-Yes!
-UG is hot,

people want to make money from it,

and bets are being made.

It's likely Maja is working for

some big shot 
who controls the competition.

The stakes are high.

T-Devil!

This bastard plays dirty.

He gets on my nerves.

Randy, David, Beanie!

Come on down!

<i>Yes, all UG experts!</i>

Fee!

<i>Everyone seems to like her!</i>

And finallyâ€¦

that's right, Web Zhang.

<i>You won't be disappointed.</i>

<i>The PK between experts</i>

<i>gets no blessings from God.</i>

<i>A tough rival does not mean fear.</i>

<i>Who will be the champ?</i>

<i>Red?</i>

<i>David?</i>

<i>Lancelot?</i>

<i>Web?</i>

<i>T-Devil?</i>

<i>Or your favorite Fee?</i>

<i>Root for the champ of your choice.</i>

<i>Anything is possible!</i>

<i>3â€¦</i>

<i>2â€¦</i>

<i>1â€¦</i>

<i>The contestants 
started almost simultaneously!</i>

<i>It's hard to say who has the lead.</i>

<i>Everyone has jumped over 
the first wall,</i>

<i>and showing their colors 
to overcome the second.</i>

<i>Red and Fee are tangled up.</i>

<i>Web took a kick on the climbing wall.</i>

<i>The heat is onâ€¦</i>

<i>and competition 
is exceptionally cruel.</i>

<i>Beanie is out!</i>

You're quick!

<i>Red is down!</i>

<i>All is lost if you're not careful,</i>

<i>and the champion title 
is gone forever.</i>

<i>You think this is cruel?</i>

<i>No, if you persist,</i>

<i>the UG world</i>

<i>can unmask its icy veil for you.</i>

Serve you right!

<i>There's no such thing as luck,</i>

<i>only the battle of strenghts.</i>

Watch out!

Hang on!

<i>Web saved the damsel in distress!</i>

<i>Our shoo-in</i>

<i>threw in the towel at the last minute.</i>

<i>No man 
can resist a pretty lady indeed.</i>

<i>T Devil and David 
both have a definite edge.</i>

<i>They are both inside the UG obstacle.</i>

<i>Who will be the winner?</i>

<i>Winner of Round 1 isâ€¦</i>

<i>David!</i>

<i>Is he the dark horse?</i>

<i>The competition has just begun.</i>

<i>Let's wait and see.</i>

T Devil, you're no match for me.

Just wait, David.

<i>Brilliant, David! That was perfect!</i>

Cheers, Web!

My hat's off to you!

You saved Fee 
because you want to hit on her?

Fee!

Can I have a word?

Are you alright?

I didn't expect you to be so heavy,

you almost pulled off my arm!

I'm sorry!

I didn't mean to!

I don't think you came here 
to thank me.

No.

I have something to show you.

I just found out

they've been watching you.

Who are they?

Tyler!

Why him?

They look like henchmen.

You said Tyler kidnapped your sister.

Why did he do it?

Who knows?

It's crazy!

Probably for money!

UGâ€¦

is not the same anymore.

It's all about money now.

Tyler kidnapped my sister,

and forced me to compete.

I guess he did it
to attract more attention

so they can make more money.

If the winner gets a huge reward,

that means UG

will make a lot more.

If so much money is involved,

is it possible someone else 
is behind Tyler?

Who else?

My friend is an accountant.

I can ask him to find out

about UG's structure.

Good!

Thanks! You need not have bothered.

At the competition today,

you need not have bothered either.

Syndra!

<i>Syndra!</i>

My dearâ€¦

Don't forget what the Boss said.

I looked into UG.

The company's investment portfolio

seems to be in order.

20 employees, an annual profit of $6m

and enjoying steady growth.

But a few months ago,

an investment company called Bandes

took control of it.

And here's the problem.

I can't find anything on them.

What does that mean?

Lookâ€¦

Most financial reports
and any information on management

are usually shown here.

But Bandes

left this blank.

I suspect
they have something to hide.

You're saying

it's a shell company?

I think so.

Young man,

whatever is your connection to Bandes,

I don't care.

Just leave her out of it.

OK?

Thank you, Uncle Meng.

A relative?

No.
He was my Dad's best friend.

What's your plan?

I must save my sister, no matter what.

I will continue to compete.

I'm tired of waiting.

Whateve will come, will come.

David, are you ready

to let me beat you.

I think I beat you last time.

<i>Hello, everyone!</i>

<i>We meet again!</i>

<i>Are you ready for Round 2?</i>

<i>Ladies and gentlement</i>

<i>and fellow contestants,</i>

<i>allow me to present</i>

<i>the Dive of Death.</i>

<i>The PK between experts</i>

<i>is romantic and fearful,</i>

<i>real and dreamy.</i>

<i>The Platform of Death</i>

<i>is this 80m tall cooling tower.</i>

<i>It is divided into 4 levels.</i>

<i>The gap between each level is 20m.</i>

<i>At the bottom 
is a high speed centrifuge,</i>

<i>powerful enough to turn over a truck.</i>

<i>The successful diver</i>

<i>can take home $50,000 USD</i>

<i>and qualify for the next round</i>

<i>for the $100,000 final.</i>

<i>Let's get a feel of</i>

<i>the thrill and danger,</i>

<i>the real UG.</i>

Urban Games Bloody Awesome!

Let's go!

<i>We have 6 contestants.</i>

<i>This is the most exciting</i>

<i>and nerve wrecking competition.</i>

<i>The fate of the diver</i>

<i>lies is that deadly jump.</i>

<i>This is the testimony</i>

<i>to UG's unyielding spirit.</i>

<i>At this moment, 
it is more than a competition,</i>

<i>it is also a battle</i>

<i>of the body and soul.</i>

<i>UG means the will power to win.</i>

Readyâ€¦

Damn!

<i>That jump doesn't look good!</i>

<i>I bet it hurts.</i>

<i>He has obviously forgotten 
about gravity.</i>

<i>David remains the dark horse.</i>

<i>Fee is on Level 4,</i>

<i>taking on the challenge 
from the highest point.</i>

<i>What fate will await her? 
Defeat or glory?</i>

<i>A new dark horse is born!</i>

<i>Fee is the champion!</i>

<i>Awesome!</i>

<i>Fee overcame her own limit.</i>

<i>This is what UG is all about!</i>

<i>Hold onâ€¦we have forgotten someone.</i>

<i>Web!</i>

<i>Where is he? Bring him in!</i>

But where?

Where is Web? Did he go home?

Where is he?

Where is Web?

He's at the top of the tower.

Web!

The jump tomorrow

is tailor made for you.

You lost Round 1,

don't let us down again.

You know what to do.

Have you decided, Web?

Isn't this what you want?

I want to see you in the final.

This is suicide, you won't make it.

Anything is possible!

You'll see!

Very well.

Let us give this daring lunatic

a great big cheer!

Web Zhang!

Go for it!

Urban Games Bloody Awesome!

You're awake?

Can I join you?

Can you dance?

Teach me.

Morning!

Morning!

When you jumped

I was really scared.

I haven't been this scared 
in a long time.

I remember last night

there was nice music,

the lights

and you.

Does it still hurt?

To be able to dance

was once my biggest dream.

Why did you give it up?

I stopped dancing 
when my parents died.

I only dance for those I love.

Sorry!

It's OK!

That was a long time ago.

After they died,

they left the bookstore 
to me and Grandpa.

Grandpa is getting on in years

and business is bad.

If this keeps up,

the bookstore 
will close down eventually.

That's why you want to win?

I'm surprised you're quite smart!

But you won the Dive of Death.

Me?

Don't you remember?

When you jumped

we all thought you'd be dead for sure.

But you were 
the closest to the ground.

You qualified for the next round.

I had no choice.

This is the only way 
to save my sister.

You can do it.

I think I want to dance again.

Bye!

What are you doing?

-Out of the wayâ€¦
-What?

Stop!

Don't move!

Where did he go?

-Damn!
-Shit!

Listen to me, Web.

It's not what you think

Or what I have imagined.

You kidnapped Syndra.

Someday you'll understand.

Webâ€¦

the last round you mustâ€¦

Tyler!

You're too smart

to do something stupid.

<i>Hello?</i>

<i>Hello?</i>

After you finish everything

Syndra, Web and you are free to go.

Finish the game properly,

do what you have to.

Tyler!

Say something!

Web!

We have eyes on you.

You better finish the competition.

<i>Tyler, you jerk!</i>

I'm helping you.

<i>You better keep your promise.</i>

You don't even know

who you're up against.

Are you alright?

See you at the finishing line.

You'll win for sure!

David, don't celebrate too early!

<i>On your marks!</i>

<i>You have 8 minutes.</i>

<i>The first person
to reach the finishing line wins.</i>

<i>You're free to choose your own route,</i>

<i>do whatever it takes.</i>

<i>The viewers want something explosive.</i>

<i>Have a nice ride!</i>

<i>Go!</i>

<i>4 contestants
chose the shortest route,</i>

<i>but both routes are bumpy.</i>

<i>Will they reach the city in time?</i>

<i>Brilliant! That only took 90 seconds.</i>

<i>Both contestants reached 
the city almost simultaneously.</i>

<i>Don't hesitate,</i>

<i>place your bets and win the big prize.</i>

<i>Oh no! Fee is down!</i>

<i>She's currently the favorite to win.</i>

<i>David is trapped as well.</i>

<i>But Fee turned things around!</i>

<i>That's what's so brilliant about life!</i>

<i>T Devil's fall is tragic!</i>

What now?

Fee!

David!

David!

-Are you alright?
-David!

David!

This baby came in handy.

I'm fine.

Who would take a shot at us?

Looks like
someone doesn't want you to win.

Syndra!

So much for you prize money!

I've been watching you, smart guy!

How dare you bet against the Boss!

You think you can fool him?

I've been monitoring your computer.

Moron!

My dearâ€¦

why don't you ever listen?

Jerk!

Here's a memento for you.

Goodbye, buddy!

I'll get back at you.

-Syndra!
-Web, be careful!

They're armed.

Tyler, let my sister go!

JJ?

It's you!?

Surprised?

Of course..

in your eyesâ€¦

I'm just another nobody

and I shouldn't be here.

I'm sorry to let you down.

Let my sister go!

You think I'm a moron?

Why would I let my hostage go?

Why did you do it?

Need you even ask?

All these years, what have I got?

Nothing!

You're the same.

You hogged the limelight, 
who cares about me?

Well?

How does it feel to be manipulated?

JJ,

we never asked for anything.

We always treated you 
like our brother.

Bullshit! I was never your brother.

No?

You have no right to give me orders.

Freeze! Drop your weapons!

Drop it!

Get down!

This way! Hurryâ€¦

Come in!

Blood!

Be careful!

You must have questions for me.

Did you kidnap Syndra?

Of course not!

If I don't do as they say,

Syndra will get hurt.

Jerk!

You knew they kidnapped me

but you still worked for them.

I'm sorry, Syndra.

You have no idea 
what they're capable of!

I had no choice.

But Web, I'm on your side.

I bet heavily on you.

I wanted to make a lot of money.

You did it for yourself!

Don't listen to him!

Why else am I here?

Syndra!

I have always loved you.

I will prove it to you.

Tyler!

You're under arrest!

You're a cop?

That's right!

We're onto them for a long time.

Take him away.

JJ and Maja got away.

They couldn't have gone very far.

I wanted to use this to find Tyler,

now this should come in handy.

In order to repay you

I have a present for you.

Web, JJ and Maja have been arrested.

But UG is still running.

The mastermind behind 
will surface soon.

I need your help.

Can you hear me, Web?

Audio and visual are clear.

Wind speed normal.

Teddy, we missed you.

Don't worry, we're fine.

Web,

Teddy would have been so proud of you.

Teddy, let's root for Web.

He'll make your wish come true today.

I know you can do it.

I'll be with you the whole time.
