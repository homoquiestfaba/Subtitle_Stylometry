And please, be warned.

If you fidget,
if you look away.

If you forget any part
of what I'll tell you.

Even for an instant.

Then our hero will surely perish.

His name is Kubo.

His grandfather stole
something from him.

That really is the least of it.

KUBO AND TWO STRINGS

Subtitle by Bambula

Well, hello, Kubo.

How was the day?
-It wasn't the bad crowd.

I got two pennies and limp ball.
This is pretty good limp.

A what have you got planned
for today? -You know, usual.

Monsters?
-Of course.

You think you can work
a fire-breathing chicken?

The chicken again?
-The chicken is funny.

A touch of comedy that
balance the whole thing out.

They gonna be throwing money at you,
I just know it.

Or they'll throw something at you,
I don't know. -Okay, I'll see what I can do.

And do you plan on finishing
the story this time, young man?

If you must blink,
do it now.

Yeah!

Pay careful attention to everything
you see and hear.

No matter how unusual may it seem.

And please be warned.
If you fidget, if you look away.

If you forget any part
of what I'll tell you.

Even for an instant.

Then our hero will surely perish.

Hanzo was a mighty samurai,
but he was alone.

His family taken from him,
his kingdom in ruins,

his army destroyed by
the dreaded Moon King.

You may recall, Hanzo was
roaming in the distant Far Lands,

in search of a magical suit of armour,
the only weapon in the whole world

that could protect him from powerful
Moon King.

This armour was made
up of three pieces.

First. -I know, I know.
The Sword Unbreakable.

The second.
-The Breastplate Impene...

Impenetrable.
-Impenetrabubble. Yeah!

And finally, the third weapon.
Final piece of the armour.

I know this one.
Pick me.

The Helmet Invulnerable.

Before Hanzo could claim the armour,

and unite pieces to
reveal their true power,

he was attacked by Moon King's beasts.

Yes!

Kill the chicken!
Rip it to pieces!

Oh, my.

Hanzo was filled with rage.

His soul tormenting by the grief
of a family stolen from him.

At last, our hero was face to face
with his nemesis,

the Moon King.

Be sure to come back tomorrow.
-Again?

What? Come on!
People like the ending.

Where are you going?

No, you can't...
You can't leave!

Kubo?

Kubo?
-Yes, mother? I'm here.

Hungry?

And even though he could barely see
his own hand in front of his face,

Hanzo and his army of loyal samurai
pressed on through the blizzard.

And suddenly, as quickly as it started,
the storm cleared before him.

Hanzo breathed a sigh of relief,
for he is home.

His fortress? The Beetle Clan castle?
-Yes, at the very edge of the Far Lands.

Hidden from the Moon King by
powerful magic.

Then what happened?
When he got to the castle?

When who got to the castle?
-Hanzo, my father.

Hanzo? Hanzo was at the castle?
He...

Just give me a second, I'm...

No. It's gone.

I can't. I'm sorry, Kubo.

Perhaps I could recall
a different story.

Mother, what was father like?

This one is easy.

Hanzo was a mighty warrior,
skilled with sword and bow.

No. What was he really like?
When he wasn't fighting.

When he was with us.

He was just like you.

Like me?
-Yes.

Strong, and clever, and funny.
And, so handsome.

Mother.
-Come on.

Never forget how much
he loved you, Kubo.

He died protecting us.

Did the Moon King...
-Your grandfather.

Did grandfather and your sisters
really kill my father?

It can't be true, can it?
They're family.

No. They are monsters.

Grandfather and my sisters
stole your eye, Kubo.

They must never find you again, never!

You must always stay
hidden from the night sky,

or they'll find you
and they'll take you away from me.

Promise me. You will never let this happen.
Promise me, Kubo.

Don't be sad, Kubo.

Kubo. Remember what you must do, Kubo.

Remember.

Keep you with me all the time,
Mr. Monkey.

And? -And keep father's robe
on my back at all times.

Yes, Kubo.
And there is one more thing.

Never ever stay out after dark.

Remember.

Yes, Mr. Monkey.
-Good boy.

Bed time.

Mother, wake up.
You're dreaming.

No. Kubo.

Kubo, is that you?
-Yes, mother. I'm here.

Kubo, what happened to your eye?

Paper boy!
Here, here!

Come on, come on. Come sit next
to me. I got us a good spot here.

What do you think?
I got myself all gussied up for the big day.

I do so love the festival.
A time to celebrate.

You know, it's a shame
you never stay pass sundown.

There's fireworks,
singing and dancing. And feasting, of course.

But the best part of all...

Do you see those lamps and altars?

We use those to speak to the
loved ones that left us behind.

We listen to their tales
and guide their safe return

to the blissful pure land.
-Really? Did you speak to someone?

Yes, I did.
My husband.

His voice was as clear and loud
as the one you use for your stories.

In 72 years,
he never had a thing to say.

Now he's gone,
I can't shut him up.

You have someone you wanna talk to, huh?
-Very much.

Well, what is stopping you?
-Don't I need a lamp?

Well, I'll bet you can make
a really nice one

with that paper folding
thing you do.

You see? Not just a pretty face, huh?

Now hurry along.

Go, there's still time before dark.
Go, get out of here.

Place the lamp at the altar.

Very good.
-What do we do next, daddy?

Now we pray.

We ask her spirit
to honour us with its light.

Grandma, will you please honour?

Softly, softly.

Hello, father.
I hope you're well.

I mean, I know you're dead,
but I hope everything is okay.

Look, it's your robe.

Mother says I'll grow into it.

She says you're a great leader,
who died protecting me.

Saving one of my eyes.

Two would have been ideal,
but thanks anyway.

Father, I'm worried about mother.

With every day goes by,
she drifts further away.

She talks a lot about you,
but... But I just don't know.

I don't think she remembers
what's real anymore.

I don't know what's real anymore.

I just wish you were here.

So I could talk to you, see you.

Find out what I should do.
-Daddy, daddy, she is here. Grandma is here.

Now it's time for the final part.

We have to help her
to get back to the spirit world.

But she just got here.
-Come on.

Father? Hello?

Any time?

Fine.

I don't need you anyway.

Kubo.

I'm sorry.

Kubo...

Here I am.

Little boy, what happened to your eye?

Who are you?
How do you know my name?

We're your family, Kubo.
Your mother's sisters.

And we've been looking for you
so long.

It's so lovely to meet you, Kubo,
face to face.

Come, Kubo,
come to your aunties.

No reason to be afraid, Kubo.

We just need your other eye.

Your grandfather admires it so.

Help! Help!
Somebody help!

Help! Look out!
Run!

Run!

Mother!

We're here, Kubo.

Your family has come for you.

Kubo.
-Mother.

Kubo, you must find the armour.
It's your only chance.

Remember this.

Mother!

Mother!

No!

Mother!

Kubo.

Can you hear me, Kubo?

I said your mother is gone.

Your village is destroyed,
burnt to the ground.

We landed here
in the Far lands.

Your enemies aren't far behind.

We must search for shelter
before your grandfather comes.

We need to go now.

Come on, get up!
Let's go!

Once we're inside, you might be
tempted to complain about the odour.

Keep in mind my sense of smell
is ten times stronger than yours.

You have questions, I can tell.

Who...
-You get three.

I think I have more.

Three, before you gonna eat.
-Why only three?

Okay, that was your first question.
-What?

I don't understand what's happening.
Who are you?

You don't recognize me?

All these years, you had to keep me
in your pack. Now you know why.

But you were a wooden charm.
You were this big.

I called that charm Mr. Monkey.

And if I were alive at that point,
I might have found it insulting.

Look, your mother used last of her magic
to save you.

And bring me to life.

Here. Drink.

It smells.
-Everything in here smells.

Drink it. -I don't want it.
-I said, drink it.

You are a mean monkey, aren't you?
-Yes. Yes, I am.

And that's three.
You're out of questions. Now just listen.

I am here to protect you, Kubo.
And that means you have to do as I say.

So, if you don't eat, you'll be weak.
If you're weak, you'll be slow.

If you're slow, you'll die.

It's too hot.

Drink.

Excuse me.

Okay, you better start
taking this seriously, Kubo.

This is real. This is not a story.

Those things, your aunts.

They never get hungry.
They never sleep.

They will find you.

And if we're not prepared...

They'll kill me
and take your other eye.

What are we gonna do?
-We're going to find the armour.

It's the only thing that can protect you.

So it's real.
Really real.

Don't worry, I am not going to keep it.

I pulled that from her head.
I didn't mean to.

Your mother was very powerful.

She blessed your robes so when the
need was most they would fly you away.

She used the last of that power
to bring me to life.

This bracelet,
her hair, it's a memory.

And memories are
powerful things, Kubo.

Never lose it.

One more question?
-Last one.

Do you know where it is?
The armour?

No. No, I don't.

Now go to sleep.

Good night, Monkey.

Kubo.

Kubo!
You were talking in your sleep.

You were dreaming,
calling out to your father.

And then the paper flew out
of your bag and folded itself into him.

He's been standing there for hours.
Quietly judging us.

I am not even convinced
that this counts as origami.

I could swear scissors were involved.

Back home in the cave,
my mother's dreams did this,

and the paper always unfolded itself
by morning.

What's that about?

What are you doing?

I guess this is how
my father answered me.

I am tempted to say
that entrusting our fate

to the guidance of the small
paper man seems like a bad idea.

But that's the best bad idea we have.

You're growing stronger.

You might not want look
quite so pleased about that.

We grow stronger,
the world grows more dangerous.

Life has a funny way
of keeping things balanced.

Monkey, do you ever say anything
encouraging?

I encourage you not to die.

"I encourage you not to die."

Mosquitoes, annoying.

It wasn't me, I swear.

Paper runs out,
as does patience.

I didn't ask them to do that.

The second time.
I didn't!

At least not exactly.
I mean, I felt it, but...

Magic is not meant to be easy.
You need to learn control.

Concentrate on what you're doing,
and always remember.

Don't mess with the Monkey.

Tread carefully, Kubo.
This isn't one of your stories.

How do you know? Maybe it is.

I'm a valiant hero
and you're the mean monkey.

Heroes come and go.

Any moment something terrible
could come out of nowhere and...

Monkey!
-Kubo!

Monkey, wait!

He wasn't trying to hurt me.

He just wanted Hanzo.
-Hanzo?

Hanzo.

I still think I'm gonna stab him.

Why must you always assume
the worst?

Pardon me for not trusting this
giant spiky insect monster

that just kidnapped you.
-Hanzo, yes. I remember him.

I think maybe he was my master.

What? What did you say?

We had a crest, a samurai crest.

Have you seen this crest before?

This is a miracle.

You have our robes.
You're wearing our robes!

Why are you wearing our robes?

He doesn't have to answer to your
questions. Anyway, who are you?

Many years ago I was cursed.

Trapped in this cursed state.

Cursed to wander the Far Lands.

Cursed or cursed.

No comrades, no master.

Not even a name or a single memory
of the noble warrior I once was.

You used to be a man?
-No, not just any man. A samurai.

I mean, I'm pretty certain.
Look, I have the staff.

I mean, I'm either a samurai
or really bad hoarder.

Either way, inside my thorax
beats the heart of a warrior.

If you have no memory,
how can you be certain of anything?

Because I get flashes.

They come about from objects I find
on my travel.

Sometimes, it's a sound
or a smell.

You must get a lot of flashes.
-Memories.

They fade. And all I'm left
with is the sense that I was

once part of something much greater.

Monkey, can I tell him?
-I really don't think it's a good idea.

He has a right. -Absolutely not.
-But... -No but! -I... -No!

What tell me, what?
-Hanzo was my Father. -Kubo!

This is a miracle.

I have found the son of my master.

Don't even...

Whatever brings you to these lands,
whatever your quest,

it is now my quest too.

I will join you and I'll give my life for you
if necessary.

Wow. You will?

What? Do you think that's possible?

I mean, I know how these quests go.

People die all the time,
they drop like flies.

That doesn't matter.
Because I have a feeling this is my destiny.

No, it isn't.
We can't trust anything you say,

because you can't
trust anything you say.

We don't know anything about you.

Monkey, you said it yourself.
Our quest is a difficult one.

A samurai, even a cursed one,
with no memories, and looks like a bug,

could be helpful.
-Yes, I'm certain that I can be helpful.

Indispensable.
-In what way?

Firing an arrow into a wall
is hardly what I call...

Impressive. -Look at that.
Literally the first time I've ever done it.

Just tell me of our quest.

And I will quickly demonstrate
my numerous indispensabilities.

Well, that's kind of a long story.

You got my attention.
I promise I won't even blink.

Actually I don't think I even can blink.
Do I have eye lids?

Fine. Walk and talk.
Hanzo has found the path.

So you used to be a toy monkey.

Kubo, I really don't see
how this part is important to our story.

I kept her in my pocket,
she was only this big.

Okay, Kubo, that's enough.
-Tiny. And she was called Mr. Monkey.

I wasn't a toy.
I was a charm.

Of course you were.

That doesn't look good.

Don't touch anything.

He did it.

Okay.

No. No. No.

Yes.

Kubo, look.

The Sword Unbreakable.

It could be a trap.

Allow me.

What, it's not a trap
if you do it?

Stealth is my middle name.

You don't even have a first name.

Don't worry, I got this.

The mighty Beetle is victorious!

I got...
I don't got this.

I don't got this! -For crying out loud!
I invoke the Sword Unbreakable!

It broke.
-So, does it just mean the handle or...

I am little disappointed
with this magic sword.

It's not the right sword, you idiot!

Look!

The sword! It's in his head!

Hey, I've got a bone to pick with you.

See? Because he is made of bones.

You are an embarrassment.

This is problematic.

Enough with the arrows!

Foot!

You can fly?
-Apparently. Yes.

Come on!

Are you sure it isn't
the Sword Unfindable?

I think I found it.

Hand here? Anyone?

Anyone else?

Kubo!

Kubo!
-Monkey!

No!
-Kubo!

Yes!

Thank goodness that's over.

Everything turning black.

Then open your eyes.

I can't feel my wings. -You didn't
even know you had them 5 minutes ago.

Stop wriggling.

Here, is that feeling better?
-Oh, yeah. Little to the left.

Down just a bit.
Right there, that's good.

Wait. You're being nice to me.

Don't tell anyone.
-We did it, Beetle.

We got the sword.

Put that down. It's sharp.

Okay. We are done here.
Get up.

We have a lot of walking to do.
-You can't be serious?

I'm always serious.

Are you two going to fight again?

Of course not.
We're having a grown-up conversation.

You're going to fight again.
-Kubo, just go over there

and play with something.
-Not that.

Monkey, this is the Long Lake.

We can't walk around it.
We need to swim across.

I can carry Kubo. -Carry Kubo?
That's your better idea?

Look, I appreciate your help,
I really do.

But when comes to the boy,
I know what's best.

Is that right? -And what's best is not to be
fielding ideas from a talking cockroach.

This coming from a talking monkey.
-I still hear you, you know.

Then play louder.

This conversation is over.
Monkeys don't swim.

Not to worry, monkey see,
monkey do.

How long have you been waiting to say that?
-Ever since I met you.

What were we grown-up
conversationing about?

You're ridiculous. You're just
absolutely ridiculous. Ridiculous!

Crossing the lake is a ridiculous idea!

It's not your fault,
there's no sense left in your head.

I think I resent that. I may not know
everything. -Anything. -Anything.

But I do know Kubo is more capable
than you think he is.

You're being a tiny bit overprotective here.
-I'm being a lot overprotective here.

It's my job to make sure Kubo is safe.

And that is not safe.
You, you're not safe.

Kubo's just a child.
-And incredibly gifted one.

He just saved our lives.
-Yes, he's very powerful,

but he still has much to learn.

What?

Fast learner.

Did you know you can do that?

Show-off.

Okay. Now take a deep breath.

Clear your mind.

I guess I got that part covered.

Now draw back slowly.
That's it. Close one eye.

Guess you got that part covered.

Concentrate on what is directly in front
of you that everything else fall away.

And release.

Perfect shot. Perfect shot.

Not bad. And what's your plan for getting the
fish into the boat so we can actually eat it?

Well, I said I was teaching him
how to shoot, not fish.

Fishing is tomorrow's lesson.

Give me that.

Grabby monkey.

Now try it.

Pull back and...

Rope, it's pretty good idea.

And you're not an awful shot.

Okay, now you two are being weird.

We're going to need something
to cut this with.

Sword Unbreakable.

Must you play with your food?

Yes.

What's the matter, Kubo?

You act like you've never had a meal
sitting between monkey and beetle before.

I've never had a meal
sitting between anyone before.

Come on, eat. You need energy. And
this is much better than whale soup.

Kubo, question.

Before you started on your heroic quest,
what were you like?

Well, I looked after my mother mostly.
And I told stories.

About mighty warriors
seeking revenge,

with battles, and monsters,
and magic.

I was pretty good at telling them.

Not so good at ending them.

Sometimes I would tell my mother stories
about little things,

like skimming rocks across the river,
or catching fireflies in the mulberry fields.

And when I told those stories,
I could see her eyes for mostly clear.

I could tell she saw me.
Really saw me.

I could see her too,
her real self, her spirit

trying to find its way out.

It was beautiful.

You know something, Kubo?
Back when you just told stories,

before you went on this great adventure,
you were still very much hero.

We're gonna have to head for shore,
find a hiding place and...

The second piece of armour.
-The breastplate.

It's down there.
-Okay, I got it.

Beetle, wait.
-No. Don't worry.

Beetles can hold their breath
underwater for a very long time.

What? Since when?
-It's a well-known fact, Monkey.

So you don't remember anything at all,

but beetle swimming,
that's what sticks in there?

No, Beetle. My mother told me
a story about the Long Lake.

There is something under the water.
-Oh, yeah?

What kind of something?
-She said there was a Garden of Eyes.

Eyes that stare into you
and into your soul.

They show you secrets.

Things that keep you down there
with them. Forever.

Okay. Well, I won't look directly
into anyone's eyes.

Even if I'm being incredibly sincere.

You're gonna miss me, Monkey.

Be careful.

He's searching for the armour,
just like his insolent father.

Yes, sister.

Then we must ensure he does not find
what remains.

Monkey, I think he's in trouble.
We should help him.

Kubo, your aunts are still out there.
I'm sorry. But we have to head for shore.

Kubo!

Look at this.

I come fishing,
and all I reeling is a stinking ape.

How pathetic that this filthy creature

is all that's left of my sister's magic.

This filthy creature will tear you apart.

Kubo...

Kubo...

Kubo!

I've crushed creatures who could
fit this world on their fingernail.

This victory brings me no honour.

Imagine how you're going to feel
when you lose.

I felt loss only once.

Eleven years ago
I lost my sister.

She fell in love with a fool,
and betrayed our father.

She was an ungrateful coward.

Who's the coward now?

I got it! I got it!

Beetle, what happened?
Where's Kubo?

Get back down there,
he's in trouble!

I got it.

Mother. Mother.

It never fails to amaze me

how the creatures down here
fight so hard just to die another day.

Down here there are days
worth fighting for.

There is nothing down here worth anything.

It's pathetic what happened to my sister.

I looked up to her,
she was so strong.

And love made her weak.

No.

It made me strong.

Over here.

The eyes! It was the eyes!

They had him in the trance.

No. No.

Come on. Come on, Kubo.

Wake up.
Please, wake up.

Please, please.
Wake up.

It's gonna be alright.
It's gonna be alright.

I'm here.
I'm right here.

I saw...
-What? What did you see?

I saw...

Mother.

My son.

So you must look more like your dad
than...

You're staring.

Let me guess. You have questions.

Why...
-I'll start.

First question.
If I'm Beetle, and you're Monkey,

why isn't he called "Boy"?

Oh, boy.

Questions can wait.
We need sleep.

Tell us your story.
Then we can sleep.

Please.

Okay. Perhaps you can help me.

The night I met your father...

Mother.

My sisters and I went to the Temple of Bones
to kill Hanzo.

Oh, right.

At the bidding of the Moon King,

my sisters and I had come down from the
night sky to kill many noble warriors.

Your grandfather told us

that any man
who found the magical armour

would grow too powerful
and be a treat to the heavens.

That night,
I arrived at the temple before my sisters.

And there he was, the mighty Hanzo.

"You've offended my father", I told him.
"Now you must die."

Yeah, that's so you.
-Beetle, shhh!

We fought...

Hanzo was strong.
But then he stopped.

He looked into my eyes
and uttered four simple words.

These words changed everything.

"I love you..."

"Monkey."

"You are my quest", he whispered.

I had seen the wonders of the universe,

but the warmth of his gaze
as I looked into his eyes,

that...
That I've never known.

It was the humanity I saw.

And that was more powerful
than anything in my cold realm.

And recognizing his compassion,
I recognized my own.

I spared his life,
he gave me mine.

And then he gave me you.

But your grandfather found us.

His rage and my betrayal
shook the heavens.

Your father and his army
gave their lives

allowing me to escape
with you in my arms.

Why does grandfather hate me?

Kubo, he doesn't hate you.

He wants to make you just like him.

Blind to humanity,
as I once was.

Only then you can take your place
beside him, as part of his family.

Cold, and hard, and perfect.

I'll never be like him. Never.

I know.

He's exhausted.

Me too.
-I am not tucking you in.

You're hurt?

It's just a scratch.

Monkey, why didn't you tell
him sooner who you really are?

The magic that keeps me here,
it's fading.

Soon I'll be gone,
and then Kubo will be alone again.

Not alone.
He is the son of Hanzo.

I'll do everything I can
to keep him from harm.

Thank you, Beetle.

To know Kubo has someone to
watch over him, when I am gone,

that would be a fine way to end my story.

Your story will never end.

It will be told by him,
and by the people he shares it with.

And by the people they shared with.
And by the people they shared with.

And by the people they shared with.
And by the people... -Beetle.

The point is, your story will live on
in him.

Hello, my young friend.

Why don't you join in my song?

But how did you... You are...
-Even blinder than you?

Twice as much, to be precise.

Which means I see double the truth.

This is all the dream.

Is this a good dream or a bad one?
-See for yourself.

My Father's fortress.
-Yes.

The last piece of the armour.
It's here?

Follow the setting sun
and you'll find it.

In the place that might
have been your home.

Claim your birthright, Kubo.

Give this story a happy ending.

Mother, Beetle, wake up.

I'm up. I'm up.
-I am down.

I think I've slept on something.

Sword Uncomfortable.

The helmet, I know where it is.
I saw it in dream, Beetle.

A dream...

It doesn't mean
anything in particular.

I mean, I dreamt I fought a giant
skeleton with swords in its head.

That really happened.
-Oh, yeah.

Beetle, come on. This way.

I spy with my one eye
something beginning with S.

Snow?
-No.

Snowflake?
-No. -Okay.

Snow-covered trees?
-Nothing to do with snow.

How about serious?

Stupid.

Okay. I got it. Snow.

He said it wasn't snow.
-It's the song.

That's not fair.
How do you see a song?

You look.

Golden heron.

It's believed that they
hold souls of the departed,

carrying them over to
ever they need to go.

What are they singing?

It's beautiful. -Many say the songs
about what happens when we die.

How don't we just disappear.

We don't?
So, what happens to us?

Like Kubo's paper,
we shift.

We transform so we can continue
our story to another place.

The end of one story
is merely the beginning of another.

I remember this place.

This is where my father
prepared for his quest.

There's something that
I don't understand.

Why would the helmet be here?

Kubo!

Release us!

Sister.

I remember how we looked up to you.

Of all of us you surely brightest.

Such a waste.

All we ever wished was to be a family
in our home among the stars.

I think we have very different
definitions of family.

Don't you touch him, you witch!

And then there's you, the thieving
insect who stole my sister's soul.

What?

This is precious.

You've been together all this time
and you haven't even realised?

You took her from us. It was only
fitting we took something from you.

How swiftly those memories
spilled from your head,

wiping out all recollection
of your obscene union...

Hanzo.
-What?

Hanzo?

I didn't know.

No!

I am forgetting why I came here for.

Mother!

It's okay, I'm here.

Father.

My son.

Seems I'm married to a bug.
-Yeah.

A samurai bug.

You are my quest.

You always have been.

Hanzo, keep him safe
no matter what.

I promise I will.

No!

Fly home, Kubo.

Kubo, is that you?

You have to leave this place.

The Moon King. He is coming.

Grandfather, it's me, Kubo.

I know you can see me.

Hello, grandson.

So good to see you at last.
So to speak.

And I see you found the armour.

Seems your mother had
reason to bring you

to this dreadful place after all.

I see.

I know you do.
That's how all this began.

You finally saw me.

It was my fault.
I should have listened to my parents.

Kubo, we both want
the exact same thing.

You want to take my other eye.

That's what you want!

Yes. But do you know why I want it?

Because you're old,
and mean, and cruel.

Now that's a little harsh.

As long as you cling to
that silly useless eye

you can't come up
to live with me in the heavens.

You'll be stucked down here
in this hell,

staring with that lonely eye
at hate, and heartache,

and suffering, and death.

Where I want to take you
we have none of those things.

It'll just be you with your family,
where you belong.

My family is gone.
You killed them.

No. They brought their
fate upon themselves.

They disgraced me,
and upset the order of everything!

That's how your story goes.

Kubo, when you're up there with me,
you'll be beyond stories.

You will be

immortal.

You will be

infinite.

No. You're wrong. Not infinite.

All stories have an end.

Is that right?

And how does this story end?

I kill you.

Very well.
Is this your wish?

To do battle with a hideous monster
who ruined your life?

To prove your worth?
Like your doomed father.

How mortal.

You want to be human?

Then share their weakness!

Suffer their humiliation!

Feel their pain!

This is the end of your story.

Now take one last look
with that lonely eye.

One last look at this
wretched place you call home.

I'm not leaving.

For every horrible thing down here,

there's something
far more beautiful.

My mother saw it. So and my father.

I see it,
even with just one eye.

Then I'll just have to rip it out
of your head again, won't I?

If you must blink,
do it now.

I know why you want my eye.

Because without it,
I can't look into the eyes of another

and see their soul,
their love.

Everything you love is gone!

Everything you knew
has been taken from you.

No, it's in my memories, the most
powerful kind of magic there is.

It makes us stronger
than you'll ever be.

These are the memories of those
we have loved and lost.

And if we hold their stories
deep in our hearts,

then you will never
take them away from us.

That really is the least of it.

Where am I?

Hello, grandfather.
-What?

Hello. What...

What happened to your eye?
-Don't you remember?

No. I'm sorry, young man.

It seems I've forgotten my story.
Can you help me?

I'll tell him.
-No, we'll all tell him.

We'll tell him everything
he needs to know.

You are the kindest, sweetest man
to ever live in this village.

Really?
-Yes.

Every day you walk around smiling
and handing out coins to children.

Like me.
-And old women.

You taught my kids to swim.
-What?

And you give blankets to the poor.
-You're a good man.

You fed the hungry.
-You always lend a helping hand.

You are a great example.
-Yes. -Absolutely.

It turns out I'm pretty selfless.
-That's why we love you.

You know, we have something in common.

We both adore your grandson.

His name is Kubo.

Kubo.

I'm sorry, but I...

But I don't remember.

Well, your grandson's a storyteller.

He'll tell you all the stories
you've forgotten.

Really?

Of course.

Hello, mother, father.

I know my stories can
tend to get a little...

long, so I'll keep this brief.

I'm very grateful I've had
the chance to meet you both.

Hear your wisdom, feel your kindness.

Even eat a meal sitting between you.

This was a happy story.

But, it could still
be a whole lot happier.

I don't know exactly what the rules are,
or how this works.

But if there were any
way to... You know.

I still need you.

So I could say this
has been a happy story.

Or I could feel it,
we could all feel it.

Then we could end this story...

Together.

The end.
