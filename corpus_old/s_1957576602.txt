AVA: Listen to me.
I have something to tell you.

[ Waves crashing ]

It wasn't long ago,
I was just like you.

Thought I could, uh,

run away from...
from my nightmares, also.

If only there was a place

I could run to that
they wouldn't follow me.

[ Thunder rumbles ]

[ Sighs ]

I hate to tell you this.

No such place exists.

Wherever I went,

there they were.

[ Sighs ]

[ Thunder rumbles ]

But don't be afraid,
because I found peace.

Everything comes to an end,
they say.

They also say,
life just goes on.

At some point, you just have
to accept your nightmares,

and know they're...

they're part of you,
like family,

[ Chuckles ]

Like an old friend.

[ Thunder rumbles ]

So I've come to a place
where I'm gonna walk alone

with open arms,
just like an old friend.

[ Screams ]

[ Thunder crashes ]

What's their name?

It's no friend.

GRIERSON: To Marie Aldrich,
please come at once.

Your mother's grave
has been vandalized.

As her only living relative,

it is up to you
to decide how to proceed.

Of course, this is
very pressing,

and discretion
is of the highest priority.

Sincerely, H. Grierson,

Caretaker, Lone Palm Cemetery.

Look.

Closed till spring.

BOTH: What?

[ Thunder crashes ]

Bridge goes up at dawn.
The island's closed till spring.

I'm not letting anybody new in.

Just gonna be locals only.

That can't be.
What do you mean?

No one can get over there?

Our last tourists,
they left on Tuesday.

Kinda just easier that way.

Sir, you don't understand,
we're not tourist.

How do you close
an entire island?

It's just till spring.

MARIE: Look.

I got this letter
just yesterday.

[ Thunder rumbles ]

This is an emergency.

I have to get to the cemetery
as soon as possible.

Please.

We better not waste any time.

[ Maria groans ]

You okay?

Yeah. Are you?

Yeah.

Did you know that?

Whole island closes.

MARIE: Of course
I didn't know that.

GEORGE: What was the plan
if we got in tomorrow,

and the bridge
was already locked?

I don't know, George.

I guess we'd have
to find a boat.

[ Wind whooshing ]

[ Car engine stops ]

[ Thunder rumbles ]

[ Gate creaks ]

GEORGE: You stay here, okay?
I'll go find him.

[ Whispering ]

MARIE: George?

GEORGE: Hey!

George?

[ Disembodied whispering ]

[ Bell dinging lightly ]

Don't be frightened, dear.

It's only me.

My, my.

MARIE: Hello.

I'm trying
to find the caretaker.

My mother's grave was destroyed.

Do you know
where I can find him?

You look like an angel,
a frightened angel like before.

What do you mean?

I saw you at the funeral
from a distance.

They call me Miss Emily.

I own the flower shop
on Main Street,

and I help care
for these graves.

Did you know her?

My dear, didn't she...

[ Thunder rumbles ]

Are you all right?

The caretaker,
have you seen him?

I'm sorry.
I must be going.

A storm's coming.

I saw someone walking amongst
the tombstones over there.

GEORGE: Hey!

MARIE: Hey!

[ Gate squeaks and clanks ]

[ Waves crashing ]

Hey!

What are you doing?

Did you find him?

[ Wind whistling ]

Come back here!

[ Wind whooshing ]

George!

GEORGE: Hey!

Hello?

Hello?

MARIE: George?

GEORGE: Hey!

Where were you?

Where were you?
I was looking for you.

You didn't hear me?

Did you see them?

Who?

The people there?

What? No. What people?

You didn't go in the woods?

I was back there.

Are you okay?

You couldn't find the guy?

No, I went to the office,
and I don't know.

I mean, I think we need

to get across the bridge
before it closes.

I can't leave her grave
like that.

Well, I mean, it's possible
we missed the guy.

Why would he say to
get here immediately

if he wasn't gonna be here?

I don't know, you know?

But there's a restaurant
we passed a couple miles back.

I mean, we could go ask?

Yeah.

What is up with you?

I don't know. Let's go.

[ Upbeat music on piano ]

â™ªâ™ª

â™ªâ™ª

[ Music stops ]

[ Door closes ]

MARIE: Excuse us.

Um, we're trying to find
the cemetery caretaker.

BARTENDER: Haskel?

Sorry?

Haskel?

He told us to come.
It's urgent.

Both of you?
[ Man laughs ]

It's quite urgent.

Is there a number
where we could reach him?

Some kind of direct line?

Lines go down pretty fast
on account of the storms.

[ Chuckling ]

Listen, we need to get across
the bridge before it closes,

so is there any help
anyone could provide?

It would be greatly appreciated.

[ Laughing ]

BARTENDER: Sure, come on.
I'll try him on the radio.

This way.

[ Object clatters ]

Wait here. I'll be back.

[ Music resumes ]

Well, now, it looks like
you sure could use a drink.

No, thank you.

You know, it's a damn shame
what happened.

This island ain't very big.

Everybody knows everything.

Do you know who did it?

Didn't anybody tell...
Henry!

HENRY: Okay, all right.

Caught me.

[ Sniffs ]

I'm the last man out this year.

What does that mean?

Well, that means
if you find yourself here

longer than you expect, why
don't you come pay me a visit?

My house is just down
the road there, number 24.

I'll be up real late,
later than everybody else.

I'll leave the light on
just in case.

Key under the mat.
I got my own boat.

I'll be a real friend to you.

Yeah?
You're gonna be my friend?

HENRY: I could be.

Tell me who did it.

Well, you ain't too good
at listenin', now are you?

Now I've tried...
All right now, come on.

Come on, come on.
All right, all right.

Your hands off me.

Everything okay?

HENRY: Oh, everything is fine,
Mr. Wonderful.

Peachy fucking keen.

[ Slurps ]

[ Glass thuds ]

We didn't reach him.

Does anyone know where
we can find the caretaker?

[ Man laughs ]

Did you check the cemetery?

[ All laughing ]

[ Music resumes ]

Let's go.

[ Feedback screeching
on radio ]

[ Jazz music plays ]

What did he say to you?

Had you met that guy?

No.

Why did he act
like he knew you?

This caretaker guy
better be dead.

[ Thunder rumbles ]

MARIE: Something's wrong here.

Something's really wrong.

Well, what do you want to do?

She didn't want to
come back here.

What?

She didn't want to
be buried here.

She tried to tell me.

She was right, there's something
wrong with this place.

She didn't want to
come back here.

[ Brakes squealing ]

[ Gearshift clatters ]

GEORGE: Hey!

Hey, talk to me!

It's crazy.
Nothing is too...

Would you just spit it out?

What the fuck is happening
right now?

I think someone
changed her will.

In those last days,
her mind was completely gone.

She was a total stranger.

But one day I woke up,
and she was back,

just like that,
like she never left.

I'd been by her side every day,

but I hadn't seen her lucid
like that in a long time.

We talked about everything,
like old friends,

if you can believe that.

But then...

everything changed.

She begged me not to let them
bury her here.

When I asked why,
you know what she told me?

[ Thunder rumbles ]

She said, that the people
on this island

made a deal with a demon.

She told me that,
a long time ago,

the early settlers
couldn't survive the storms,

and everyone was dying.

Whole families were wiped out.

Until one day, when a man
crawled out of the ocean

and offered them a deal.

She said, her family,
our family,

was part of this pact.

[ Chuckles ] I know.

I know how this sounds.

I was angry with myself
for believing even for a second

that she was back,
that it was her again.

But then suddenly
it says in her will that

she wants to be buried here?

And then her grave
gets all smashed.

And then they call me down here
right before

they're about
to lock the bridge?

What if this is
some kind of trap?

[ Indistinct whispering ]
Jesus.

George, what if this
is some kind of trap?

[ Woman singing in
foreign language ]

[ Laughs ]

I'm sorry. I...

I shouldn't have told you that.
I shouldn't have told you that.

I can't believe
I just told you that.

I can't believe I just
told you that.

What?

Hey!
What?

Well, are you
gonna say anything?

[ Laughs ]

What would you like me to say?

I spent two days
in a car with you,

and you don't say shit,
and, suddenly, tonight,

you're laying demons
and sea creatures on me.

I mean, what the fuck?
How do you tell someone that?

Why didn't you tell me
any of this?

How do you tell someone that?

When it was actually happening,

I didn't think you were ever
gonna talk to me again anyway.

I thought maybe we could
just start over?

You could've called me?
I did.

Not now, then.

You didn't have to deal
with that alone.

Yeah, what were you gonna do?
Sitting in room a with her,

listening to this nonsense
day after day, over and over.

I shouldn't have dragged you
into this.

I'm sorry.

I mean, just to be clear,
her mind was gone.

You know?

You know how crazy
that shit sounds, right?

Yeah. I just...

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

Me too.

Thank you.
You're welcome.

I mean it.
I know.

Can we please get
the fuck out of here?

Yes.

â™ª There is someone â™ª

GEORGE: When we get
back to New York,

I'm not sure what
you've been dealing with

in terms of logistics
and paperwork,

but if you need help
with anything,

you know, you should
feel free to ask.

Thanks. Uh...

â™ª In my head â™ª

â™ª Turn around â™ª

I'm gonna sell her house
on Block Island,

but maybe we could spend
the weekend there

before I put it
on the market.

Yeah.

Really?

Yeah, that sounds great.

â™ª To stand beside you â™ª

â™ª Turn around â™ª

â™ª Look at me â™ª

Jesus.

â™ª And there's someone â™ª

â™ª Turn around â™ª

Hold on.

[ Car engine revs ]

[ Tires squealing ]

What the...

[ Tires squealing ]

This is the way we came?
It has to be.

MARIE: You didn't make
any other turns?

There's been one road
we've been on the entire time.

Well, turn around!
We got to get out of here.

â™ª Look at someone â™ª

â™ª Who really loves you â™ª

â™ª Turn around â™ª

[ Brakes squealing ]

GEORGE: No!
What the fuck is going on?

There, there! There!
No, we did not come

from that way!

There's nowhere else to go.
Jesus!

â™ª Look at me â™ª

GEORGE: No, no, no, no!
What is happening right now?

Watch out!

please hold.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know,
I know, I know,

but the secretary's
not in today, okay?

Give me one second, please.
[ Telephone rings ]

Price and Price. Hey.

I'm like literally
drowning here

because the girl
who's supposed to be here

just got back from like a trip
from France or something,

and we were
in the conference room,

and she was talking,
and then she got sick.

[ Overlapping voices ]

AVA: I want you to know that my
life truly has been a dream,

and I want to thank each and...

One second. Ms. Aldrich?

Yeah, they're ready for you.

[ Phone continues ringing ]

Ms. Aldrich, we understand
that you're upset.

I'm not upset.
I'm telling you what she said.

She didn't want this.

In fact, she begged me
not to let it happen.

I've got a copy of her
will right here.

MARIE: I know
what the will says.

I'm telling you that it's wrong.
She never visited the place.

She never talked about it
my whole life.

She never mentioned it.
This doesn't make any sense.

Be that as it may,
we can't just take

the word of her daughter.
It's not my word!

Especially when it's written
into the will.

That's the law.

Plus, we have
to consider the press.

The press?
They'll say

Ava Aldrich's problem child
is trying to change her will.

Everybody will assume
it's about inheritance.

WOMAN: We sympathize with you.

We truly do,
but we don't want this

to become more complicated
than it already is.

We're thinking of you here.

That's right.
I don't give a shit

what anybody says about me.

I'm not some problem child.

We never...
She begged me

right until the very end,
even when she was

in and out of consciousness,
even when she couldn't form

a single fucking sentence,
over and over,

she kept repeating,
"Don't take me back there."

Ms. Aldrich.
The law is the law.

[ Sighs ]

And don't call me, Ma.

"Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma."

Okay.
You don't need to do that.

AVA: And talkin' to me

I heard you.

Did you hear anything I said?

I heard you.

Did you read it in a story

Don't talk to me like that.

You were telling me the truth?

You were never grateful.

FISHERMAN: Nope.

But if he ain't dead,

you better hope
they ain't found him either.

Shh.

MARIE:
What's wrong with these people?

Ain't nothin' wrong
with these people.

They're just cursed is all.

Whole damn island's cursed.

The place is evil.

He trapped us all here
a long time ago.

That's why they brought
your mother back.

She's got a contract to fulfill,

a debt to pay to him.

MARIE: A man from the sea?

Did she tell you about him?

She tried to... at the end.

FISHERMAN: Then why the hell
did you come back here?

MARIE: Because it sounded
too insane to be true.

FISHERMAN: Aah.

MARIE: Where are we going?

FISHERMAN: Listen,
the tourist season

brings the sunshine, right?

Sunshine brings people.

People have all this energy,

and also,
we harvest that energy,

and then when everybody leaves,
well, that's when he feeds.

MARIE: "Feeds"...
What does that mean?

FISHERMAN: Take a look down,
darlin'.

You've been standin' on 'em
since you got here.

He just sucks it out of 'em,
you know?

Leaves 'em all dried up,
desiccated,

like a mummy in a museum,

a statue or something,

till someone comes along
and disturbs 'em.

MARIE:
Then what the fuck are you?

FISHERMAN: I'm the same
as the rest of 'em!

But every year,
somebody's gotta stay awake.

This year,
I made sure it was me.

MARIE: Why?

FISHERMAN: Oh, my God.
You don't...

Oh, you don't recognize me
at all, do you?

No.

Just tell me who you are.

God, man. She didn't say
one word about me.

No matter anyway.

That's my house over there.

I'll get you to the boat
and get you to the mainland.

I can't leave here without him.

Ready?

Come on, let's go!

No.

I'm gonna go ups there...
No, don't go up there!

He begged for salvation.

What are you?

people here are my fingers.

Island is the palm of my hand.

but in death, they belong to me.

You belong to me.

as easy as driving a car,</i>

<i>boat, or commercial truck.</i>

<i>To lower the bridge...</i>

[ Upbeat whimsical music ]

[ Clanging, motor whirs ]

[ Motor whirring ]

[ Tense music plays ]

[ Horn sounds ]

Yes.

[ Sinister music plays ]

Come on.

[ Disembodied growling ]

[ Bridge clanks ]

[ Thunder crashes ]

[ Marie panting ]

[ Sentimental music plays ]

[ Pants ]

Oh, wait.

[ Dramatic music plays ]

Can't let you go, miss.

MARIE: No! No.

BRIDGE MAN: I know who you are.

Knew since the moment I saw you.

Your mother did terrible things.

He wants you to see
what happens.

She didn't do anything wrong!

She left!

She turned her back
on this place.

I've been waiting my whole life,

serving them, protecting them,

making sure nobody came in
when they weren't supposed to.

I worked so fucking hard

for salvation,

salvation that
she was born with,

and she just goes
and throws it away.

I mean...

how can somebody
just leave heaven?

You don't know
what you're doing.

I don't?

I don't?

I don't fucking know
what I'm doing?

I need you to listen to me.

That place isn't heaven.

[ Thunder rumbles ]

Don't say that.

[ Wind whistles ]

It's true.

BRIDGE MAN: Stop.

That place is hell.

Stop it,

[ Thunder rumbles ]

I've seen what they become.

They're trapped.

I'm sorry, but you were tricked.

They've all been tricked!

I promise you.

Just let me go!

I said, stop!

Stop!

[ Wind whistling ]

I can kill you,

and yous just gonna
come right back

like the rest of them...

'cause you're one of 'em.

Everybody knows it.

I can pay you.

Name your price.

[ Dramatic music plays ]

[ Chuckles ] Have you heard one
goddamn thing that I've said?

Have you been listenin'?

'Cause I don't want any money.

I don't want no fucking money!

I just want life.

I just want life after death.

Fuck you!

Fuck me?! Fuck me?!

Fuck me?!

Well, you're gonna come with me.

Or I'm gonna shoot you,
and it's gonna hurt.

But you're gonna
come back real quick,

'cause it's that
time of the year.

So you're gonna
come back real quick.

[ Thunder rumbles ]

[ Wind whooshing ]

Eternal life.

Eternal salvation.

[ Breathes heavily ]

He's waiting.

[ Laughs ]

[ Sinister music plays ]

[ Bridge Man whistles ]

I hate to say it, missy,
but...

your mom made some good movies.

[ Water laps ]

[ Bridge Man whistles ]

Don't go thinkin'
about runnin' or nothin',

'cause I'm a pretty good shot
for an old man.

[ Thunder rumbles ]

You're a lucky girl.

You know that?

I'd trade places with you
any day.

[ Indistinct whispers ]

[ Eerie dramatic music ]

Go on.

I'm not allowed any further.

[ Scoffs ] Not yet anyway.

[ Eerie dramatic music plays ]

Is this really what you want?

BRIDGE MAN: More than anything.

Then, go on.

[ Dramatic music continues ]

[ Gate creeks ]

[ Breathing heavily ]

[ Somber music plays ]

Ma?

Ma?

[ Sobs ]

This is a nightmare.

Are you my old friend?

[ Intense dramatic music plays ]

Wait!

[ Thunder crashes ]

[ Waves crashing ]

[ Disembodied voices
speaking indistinctly ]

[ Dramatic music continues ]

[ Growls ]

[ Dramatic music continues ]

[ Growls continue ]

I'm sorry!

[ Growls continue ]

MARIE: She said that
the people on this island

made a deal with a demon.

I see.

I see now.

<i>She told me that...
a long time ago,</i>

<i>the early settlers
couldn't survive the storms,</i>

<i>until, one day, when a man</i>

<i>crawled out of the ocean...</i>

<i>and offered them a deal.</i>

<i>He offered them a deal.</i>

GEORGE: <i>The entire island
is the palm of my hand.</i>

[ Sinister music plays ]

DISTORTED VOICE: <i>The island
is the palm of my hand.</i>

AVA: Did you fall asleep?

Just for a second.

How are you?

AVA: Good.

You?

Good.

AVA: I ever tell you
I had a brother?

You had a brother?

AVA: Yeah.

He was older than me.

[ Sinister music plays ]

What happened?

Oh, they never told me
what happened.

They thought I was too little
to know.

Of course,
I overheard conversations,

and I pieced things together.

He drowned.

He was a good swimmer, too,
but he drowned.

I loved him more

than anything
in the whole world,

and he was gone just like that.

[ Sighs deeply ]

But one day, after the funeral,

it was late at night,

I was in my room,

and I heard something
outside my window,

and I looked,

and there he was.

So I followed him.

I followed him into the woods.

And he turned.

And he looked at me.

And I knew it wasn't him.

I knew it wasn't him,

and we had made a deal
to go together,

but that wasn't him.

So I ran.

I was frightened.

I ran as fast as I could.

I ran, and I never looked back,

and don't... don't ever
take me back there.

Don't you ever let anybody
take me back there,

my ashes, my bones,

my nothin'.

Okay.

AVA: Promise.

I promise.

[ Thunder rumbles ]

[ Melancholic music plays ]

[ Bell jingles ]

[ Indistinct conversations ]

Hello?

MARIE: Just a minute.

Oh, hello.

WOMAN: Hi.

You two must be
the last ones here.

Bridge goes up tomorrow.

WOMAN: We can't seem
to bring ourselves to leave.

MAN: You mean they actually
lock people out of this place?

Just until spring.
What can I do for you?

We were hoping to stop here
one last time.

You have got the most
beautiful flowers,

if you have any left.

Oh, thank you.

My grandmother will be
thrilled to hear that.

[ Eerie music plays ]]

We wanna take some home
with us, you know, for memories.

Of course.

On me.

WOMAN: Really?

Thank you so much.

You're welcome.

We love this town,
don't we, darling?

Uh-huh.
That's right.

Well, you can always come back.

I wish we could stay
here all year round.

Don't be silly.

Nobody does that.

Well...

thank you again.

See you next season.
