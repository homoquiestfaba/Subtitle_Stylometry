(Ominous music)

(Light eerie music)

(Maggie groaning)

(Maggie whimpering)

Ah, you're awake.

That's good.

It's better when they're awake.

(Maggie crying)

Look at me, Maggie.

Look at me.
(Maggie whimpering)

Look at me, Maggie.

Look at me!

(Phone ringing)

(Cordell groaning)

What?

I'm working.

This is my private time.

Is it so difficult for you
to give me a moment alone?

No, we've talked about this.

(Light dramatic music)

Babies cry.

Oh, no, no, we've
been through this.

No.

Listen to me!

If you're that worried
about it call a doctor,

but don't bother
me again tonight.

I'm working on a
special project.

(Maggie grunting)
(Hammer thudding)

(Cordell groaning)
(Maggie panting)

Help!
(Suspenseful music)

(Maggie gasping)

[Cordell] Shut up!

(Cordell screaming)

(Suspenseful music)

(Maggie grunting)
(Foot thudding)

(Maggie panting)

Help!

Help!

When I was 15 years old I
barely escaped with my life

from serial killer,
Cordell ray Colton.

Otherwise known as
the east bay butcher.

He brutally murdered 16 women

and is suspected of
killing five more.

He abducted them, tortured them,

and ultimately
strangled them to death.

He was called the butcher
because he hogtied his victims;

he tied their hands
and ankles behind them,

and then stabbed them repeatedly
postmortem, like a butcher.

I was lucky.

Lights please.

That night changed my life.

I went to school and
I got a doctorate

in clinical forensic
psychology and I wrote a book.

And that's what brings me here.

This semester, we will
delve into the mind

of the serial killer.

Through the study of
their actions and psyches,

we hope to see the
signs and predict

this type of behavior
before it happens.

So, that's my spiel.

Any questions?

About the syllabus?

Okay, we have 10 minutes.

Ask away.

(Light dramatic music)

It, it was a mistake.

A mistake?

That's bold because he left
me, he left our daughter-

[Richard] I
didn't leave Jenny.

[Maggie] For a girl that
was just a few years older.

That's unfair.
Tell me about it.

Maggie, Richard is
trying to tell his truth.

He slept with a student at
the school where we both teach.

Okay, so his truth is
he should be fired.

Look, if that's what you want-

but I keep my mouth shut
in order to protect him

and to protect our
jobs and to protect

our daughter's future.

I still haven't told Jenny.

Thank you for that.

Yeah, so she
doesn't understand why

I suddenly kicked her
father out of the house.

She thinks I'm the bad guy.

I'm the bad guy while
he's running around-

I never meant to
hurt you, I just-

no, I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

We're separated and
nothing is gonna change.

(Maggie crying)

Just tell me why.

I mean, why did you do it?

I thought we were good.

Weren't we good?

Yeah, Maggie, we were good.

(Somber music)

Jenny?

Hello?

(Phone ringing)
(Maggie sighs)

Hey.

So, how was it?

[Maggie] Predictively awful.

Oh, tell me you didn't cave.

Oh, no, no,
nothing has changed.

He's still staying at the hotel.

We're staying separated
and I'm staying miserable.

Okay, that's the
wrong attitude.

We're going out tonight, get
you in the right head space.

Oh, I, I can't.

I really need to
spend time with Jenny.

[Alyssa] Hey, you need
to give yourself a break.

Listen to some music, have
a couple of margaritas.

Oh, hold on.

Hello, yo?

What?
You wanna grab a pizza?

Oh, no, I can't.

I'm crashing at Renee's tonight.

Sorry.

[Alyssa] Well,
well, sounds like your

social calendar just opened up.

Yep.

So what time?

(Upbeat music)

(Alyssa laughing)

See, isn't this better
than sweatpants and ice cream

and feeling sorry for yourself?

Hm, no, nothing's better
than ice cream and sweatpants.

Girl, if you truly believe
that, you really need a man.

That is the one
thing I do not need.

Oh, a man for the moment.

A fling.

No thanks.
(Alyssa sighs)

Maggie, you're an amazing,
beautiful, brilliant woman.

You deserve a man that
treats you that way.

Let's find you one.

Come on.

Hm, okay, let's see
who's here tonight.

Too old.

Mm mm.
Oh, my god.

We're not doing this.
(Alyssa laughing)

â™ª And that's magic â™ª

Too married.

Um, mm mm.

Mm, oh my god, don't look.

I went out with
that guy last week.

Don't look!
Which?

I was just trying
to see which one.

Mustache.

Okay.

Oh, he saw you.

Oh my god, he's a creep.

I swiped right, we
went out for a drink,

he asked to come back to my
place 'cause he's got roommates.

He's 40!

Who has roommates at 40?

Oh, he's coming over.

Hey, gorgeous.
Hey, you.

It's um, it's Alice, right?
Oh my.

Close, Alyssa.
Oh.

Uh huh, well, it's
actually a girls' night.

Mm, for my birthday.

Ooh, birthday girl!
Uh huh.

[Man] That means I
get to buy you a drink.

Yeah it does.
Let's get some shots.

Ah, shots!

(Kyle clears throat)

Oh, hi.

This is gonna sound like
a line, but have we met?

Yeah, that definitely
sounds like a line.

Especially because I was
trying to think of a line

when I realized that
I think I know you.

I'm Kyle.
Maggie.

Buy you a drink, Maggie?

How old are you?

Isn't that considered
a rude question?

Uh, not if I'm asking because

you seem entirely
too young for me.

I'm old enough
to buy you a drink.

I haven't really considered
where our relationship

will go from there, but Iâ€™m
happy that you're thinking

long term about this thing.

I'm 25.
Hm.

We're drinking
margaritas, right?

Yes.

Be right back.

(Rock music)

So, tell me about you, mags.

Oh, (giggling), please
don't call me that.

I actually hate that.
Oh, strike one.

Sorry.

It's okay.

I teach at Rose
state university.

Smart and beautiful.

What do you teach?

Art history?

Philosophy?

Home economics?

Criminal psychology.

Delving into the
minds of criminals?

Not exactly.

I specialize in serial killer-
serial killers.

Yeah.

How did you know that?

Maggie, Dr. Margaret Borgan?

Mm hm.
I knew it!

I knew I recognized you.

Your picture's on
the book jacket.

You wrote "intent to
murder," a huge best seller.

Yep, that was me.

Told you it wasn't a line.

Fair enough.

Wow, what you went through.

I mean, you were the only
one to escape from...

What was his name?
Cordell ray Colton.

Well, isn't this
just the cutest thing?

What's going on over
here with you two?

Well, I've been
crushing on Maggie here,

but I'm not sure
I'm doing so well.

You're doing fine.

I'll take fine.

Fine is good.

Alyssa, this is Kyle.

Hey, Kyle.
Hi.

I'm gonna steal her from
you for just a minute.

Okay.
Two more margaritas.

Mm mm, I'll take those.

Excuse me.

(Pool balls clacking)

Chemistry, intense chemistry.

I'm married.
Separated.

From a man who happens
to be a deceitful,

duplicitous philanderer.
Okay.

Look, you two wanna
work it out, that's fine,

but you're allowed to
explore your options.

You got a hall pass, girl.

At least for tonight
and that kid is yummy.

I'm just sayin'.
He's a kid.

Yeah, but he's hot (giggling).

Mm hm.

Yeah and he seems polite
and he seems smart and-

mm hm.
Yeah, I like the way

he looks at me, no, no.

No, no, no, I, I, I haven't,

I haven't done this in while-
girl, it's just like

riding a bike, only better.

Besides, when's the last time

Richard looked at you like that?

Oh.

Hm, look, Iâ€™m
leaving with mustache.

Do we even know his name?

Yeah, of course, it's
Ron, John, I don't know.

Girl, the point is Jenny's at

a friend's house for the night.

You're a free agent.

Go have fun.

After everything that you've
been through this year

you deserve it.

Even if it's just for one night.

Come here.

You're gonna be okay, right?

Yes, I'm gonna be fine.
Okay.

All right, you have fun.
I will.

No, you're right I know
you're gonna have fun.

(Alyssa giggling)

(Light rock music)

Sorry.
No worries.

Thanks for waiting.
Of course.

But I should call it a night.

That's a terrible idea.

We're just getting
to know each other.

Yeah, it's just I need to um-

what?

(Ominous music)

Do you know that girl?
I have to go.

(Door creaking)

(Maggie panting)

Come on.

Maggie, you left
them at the table.

Thank you.
Are you okay?

Who was that girl back there?

She's um...

She's the girl that my
husband left me for.

Yeah, she ugh.

She follows me around, you know?

She um, she sometimes
calls my cell phone.

It's a little weird.

Hey, I'm so sorry.

Do you want me to
go talk to her?

I want you to kiss me.

â™ª Magnetic â™ª

â™ª I got something kinetic â™ª

â™ª I'm a one of a kind,
but don't sweat it â™ª

â™ª I'm unapologetic â™ª

â™ª are you down for the ride â™ª

â™ª yeah, woo hoo â™ª

â™ª ah ah ah, go now â™ª

â™ª here we go now â™ª

â™ª I got something that
you'd never seen â™ª

â™ª go now, here we go now â™ª

â™ª I gotta get it, get it,
gimme, gimme what you got â™ª

â™ª woo hoo â™ª

â™ª yeah â™ª

â™ª you're magnetic â™ª

â™ª so fly it's poetic â™ª

How are you?

Ah, overwhelmed.

(Both chuckling)

Is that a good
thing or a bad thing?

Yes.
(Kyle laughing)

I like this.

You and me.

So, what's with the hotel?

It's temporary.

I'm trying to find
a place to buy here.

[Maggie] Hm.

What was he like?

Who?

The east bay butcher.

Cordell ray Colton.
I don't...

I don't wanna talk
about that right now.

Why not?

You wrote a book about it.

And I always felt you
left stuff out of it.

Um...

And at one point in here you,
you say he got a phone call,

but you don't say from whom.

Could you tell?

What were they talking about?

Hey, what's all this about?

Come on, it's
interesting to me.

This psycho is about
to end your life,

but somehow you find the
strength to get away?

I mean, how did you do that?

He didn't make any mistakes
with all the others.

It wasn't an
accident meeting you

at the bar tonight was it?

What do you mean?

Of course it was.
Oh, you're lying.

What, Maggie, calm down.

Oh, I'm calm.

You're lying and I'm leaving.

Hold on, where are you going?

What are you, like a
tabloid reporter trying

to get information
to make a quick buck?

Or are you like some
whacked out groupie

who's just fascinated
with serial killers?

You're talking crazy.

I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have brought it up.

Yeah, he was gonna murder me.

Well, you read the book.

I would have been his 17th
victim and you thought

that would make for
good pillow talk?

You didn't seem upset when
you talked about it in class.

(Light dramatic music)

What did you say?

(Kyle sighs)

You're right, it
wasn't an accident

meeting you at the bar.

Who are you?

I'm in your criminal
psychology class.

(Maggie sighs)

You're a student?

You told me you were 25.

That's true, I traveled for
a while after high school.

I never would have been here
if I knew you were a student.

That's why I
didn't mention it.

Maggie, wait.

Get outta my way.

Look, Maggie, I'm sorry.

I, I just wanted to
get to know you without

the whole school
thing in the way.

Let me out of
your place please.

Now.

I'm really sorry.

(Light eerie music)

Morning.
Oh my gosh, you scared me.

I thought you were at Renee's?

I was, but we got into
a fight and I came home.

What about you, big night?

No, why?

I just um, I was, I
stayed at Alyssa's.

Right.

So, I guess you doing the
walk of shame means that you

and dad really aren't
getting back together, huh?

I stayed in
Alyssa's guest room.

Mom, I'm not a child.

You can tell me.

No, I don't think your father

and I are getting back together.

(Jenny scoffs)

(Bugs chirping)

(Phone ringing)

(Maggie sighs)

Hello?

Hello?

(Phone ringing)

Hello, listen, Sarah,
I know this is you.

You can have my husband, okay?

Good luck with that, now
just stop calling me please

or I'm calling the police.

(Light eerie music)

(Maggie sighs)

(Door thudding)
(Maggie gasps)

(Suspenseful music)

(Soda can cracking)

Oh, dammit.

Gave me a heart attack.

What are you doing here?

I didn't mean to wake you.

I just had to get something
out of the garage.

So you just break
into my house?

I have a key.

I live here.
Lived, past tense.

I'm miserable
without you, Maggie.

This whole thing has made me
realize how much I love you.

Can we give it one more try?

She's still following me.

Your fling.

I saw her again last night.

You know, maybe it's
just a coincidence?

No, it's not.

And you promised me you
were gonna deal with her.

I did and I'm handling it.

As for us, I can't give up.

I'm not going to, okay?

I'm gonna show you that
I can be a better man.

(Ominous music)

(Birds chirping)

Well, hello there.

(Suspenseful music)

(Dramatic music)
(Maggie gasping)

Jenny, cereal.

You know, I could
live in a freshman dorm.

Hang out with my peers,
we can party at nine,

then roll outta
bed and go to class

in our pajamas in the morning.

But no, I live here with
my overly cheery mother,

the college professor.

It's really not the college
experience I was asking for.

Well, this overly
cheery college professor

just happens to
pay your tuition.

Well, I mean, you
and dad teach here,

so that's why it's free.

I'm not really sure what
it is you're paying for.

Uh, I paid for that cereal.

Do you want it or not?

It's your favorite.

Lucky me.
(Maggie laughing)

(Light dramatic music)

Oh my god, it reeks in here.

What is that smell?

(Suspenseful music)

(Jenny screaming)

(Dramatic music)

A dead animal in
our car, Richard.

What are you talking about?

Are you okay?

Your girlfriend, you know
the one who keeps calling me

then hanging up, then just
showing up wherever I am?

[Richard] Showing up?

Showing up where?
She put a dead possum

in my car.
What?

Maggie, she would never
do anything like that.

You know what, if she
doesn't leave our family alone,

I am telling you I am
going to the police.

I will talk to the university
administration if I have to.

I don't care.
No!

Please do not do that.
(Sarah giggling)

You know what?
All right.

I'll see you guys
back at the house.

Yeah, okay.
I'm done waiting for you

to step up and deal with her.

I'm gonna handle this myself.

What does that mean?
(Ominous music)

Maggie, Maggie, don't do any-

(dramatic music)

Excuse me.
Professor Borgan.

What a nice surprise.

You seem upset about something.

I want you to leave
me and my family alone.

I don't know what
you're talking about.

Stop calling me.
Wow, really?

I have much better things to do.

And anyway, when I saw
you out the other night

it was obvious that
you had moved on.

Back on the dating scene.

What I do and who I see
is none of your business,

but putting a dead animal
in my car, that's sick.

And it's criminal.

Dead animal?

That's ridiculous.

I'm not playing games.

Stay the hell away
from my family.

Does the rest of your
family feel the same way?

And by the way, Iâ€™m
pretty sure threatening

a student is grounds
for dismissal.

It takes more than an entitled
little girl to scare me.

Richard and I are in love!

Ted Bundy was a
master manipulator.

He would often feign
an injury in order

to lure his victims into
a false sense of security.

But his best weapon
wasn't a fake cast.

Bundy was an accomplished hunter

because of his natural gifts.

He was charming, good looking,
no one feared him because why

would he need to hurt anyone
in order to get what he wanted?

The answer is he didn't
need to, he wanted to.

He wanted to kidnap these women.

He wanted to torture them.

He wanted to kill them.

Thank you.

(Dramatic music)

All right, that's all for today.

Please finish the readings
on Dahmer for Wednesday.

Thank you.

(Students talking
over each other)

I knew there was something
you weren't telling me!

I don't wanna talk
about it ever again.

I just wanna pretend that
night never happened.

This could ruin your career.

You told me to go with it.

I didn't know he was a
college student in your class.

I mean, that's a
crucial bit of Intel.

This looks bad, Maggie.

I mean, first Richard, now you?

I know.

I, I, I'm gonna
talk to Kyle, okay?

I just, I've never done
anything like this before.

Hey, you didn't
do anything wrong.

He lied to you, but
you're gonna be the one

who has to prove it if he talks.

I know.

You're right, you know what?

I'll see you later.
Okay.

(Suspenseful music)

Hi, mags.

I told you not
to call me that.

Right, sorry, I've
never been too good

at following directions.

What are you
doing in my office?

Door was open.

I figured it'd be okay.

I'm sorry.

Did I scare you?

No, no, no, no, you didn't.

You really are
something, you know that?

Actually, I'm glad
you're here because um,

we need to talk.
(Kyle scoffs)

Why is this all
so complicated now?

It's not complicated.

You lied.

You're right, I did lie.

And I'm sorry.

You didn't ask too
many questions did you?

What's that supposed to mean?

We both got caught
up in the moment.

And the moment is over.

You need to understand that.

You can't deny the
connection we have.

It's special and it's unique.

It's nonexistent.

Agree to disagree I guess.

Look (sighs), what
you did was wrong,

but I accept that you
didn't mean to hurt me.

Why would I hurt you, Maggie?

We're consenting adults.

You should be seeing
girls your own age, Kyle.

You know, going to parties,
having fun, being a college kid.

That's a little
condescending don't you think?

What happened between
us was a mistake.

But I need your word
that it stays between us.

Oh, I see.

So that's what you're afraid of.

That I'm like Sarah Ellet?

What?

Oh, I mean, Sarah tells
anyone who will listen about

her affair with your husband,
but you knew that right?

That's why you cornered
her on campus today.

Heard about that too.

Those sorority girls talk a lot.

Maggie, I would
never do that to you.

Okay, you know what?

You need to withdraw
from my class today.

And our paths can
never cross again.

Do you understand?

Whoa, what did I do?

Today.

Do you understand?
Yeah, I get it.

I don't love the tone,

but you're under a lotta
pressure right now.

I know this might sound silly,

but I'm a fan of yours, Maggie.

I just wanna be your friend.

Please leave.

(Light eerie music)

(Maggie sighs)

[Jenny] Okay, so you
know professor Wetterling?

Mm hm.
Okay, so I totally

failed my last quiz, but
I went to go talk to him

and he gave me a B!

Yeah, it's 'cause Wetterling
thinks you're pretty.

(Jenny laughing)
Hey, mom's home.

Yay, let the fighting begin.

Who's fighting?

Nobody's fighting.

Can I talk to you in private?

She is.

Sounds like it's gonna be epic.

Good luck.

(Jenny sighs)

Oh, mom, by the way,

you got another fan
letter from your psycho.

I put it on the counter.

He's still writing you?

What are you doing here?

(Richard clears throat)

So, I talked to Sarah
about the dead opossum.

She didn't do that, Maggie.

Wow, still
defending her honor.

It's noble.

And she also told me
about your little talk.

Threatening a student?

What are you thinking?

Someone needs to
protect this family.

I guess you do
wanna fight, huh?

She's talking to people.

What?
Yeah.

She's telling everyone at school

about the affair that
she had with you.

No way.
Mm hm.

A student confronted
me about it.

What student?

I knew this was a mistake.

I shoulda taken Jenny and left
the moment that I found out.

How do you think your
little father-daughter time

is gonna go when she finds out

that you had an affair
with a sophomore?

Look, I know this
hasn't been easy

for you not telling Jenny.

I don't want her to hate you.

I want her to be happy.

And none of that is gonna matter

if she hears what
you did on campus.

So, please, tell that
little bitch to back off.

(Upbeat music)

(People talking over each other)

(Phone dinging)

Hey, this round's on me.
Yes, let's make a toast.

[Haley] Sarah,
we're taking shots.

To kappa girls,
who's better than us?

Nobody!
Nobody!

That's right.
Yes!

Sarah, get your
butt over here.

Coming.

Ladies, ladies.

Think positive, test negative.

Cheers to the pyramid.
That's right.

(Girls cheering)

Woo, oh my.
Oh, that one hurt.

Another one, let's go.
Woo!

Let's go!
Talk to a guy.

Oh my god.
And one time he goes,

"a bunch of people cut up."

What (shrieks)?
Oh my gosh.

Have fun tonight.
I hope so.

See you tomorrow.
Bye.

(Light dramatic music)

(Suspenseful music)
(Sarah screaming)

(Eerie music)

(Dramatic music)
(Young Maggie gasps)

(Young Maggie groaning)

(Cordell chuckling)

[Cordell] This
one's a fighter.

(Suspenseful music)
(Van doors slamming)

(Dramatic music)

[Man on CD] Flowing with joy.

(Becky sighs)
I am relaxed.

I am calm.

I am overflowing with joy.

I am relaxed.

I am calm.

(Light dramatic music)

[Police dispatch]
On west 81st street.

Okay, I've got a 31 clear.

[Woman] 13a and I
know of the suspects.

(Becky sighing)

I am relaxed.

I am calm.

I am overflowing with joy.

What?

You're overflowing with what?

I wasn't talking to you.

[Officer Bueller] They don't
teach that in boy scouts.

The handcuff knot?

No, they don't.

Officer Bueller, wrap up
the scene with the coroner.

Sure, where are you going?

We have an ID on the victim.

I have to inform the parents,

and then I'm headed
to the university.

(Light eerie music)

Oh!
What the hell?

Are you all right?

I wasn't looking
where I was going.

I noticed.

I'm, I'm new here
and totally lost.

Do you know, is this
the bard building?

Bard's just two over there.

It's by the library.

Probably walked right past it.

Well, thanks and sorry again.

I can show you.

That'd be great.

I'm Kyle.
I'm Jenny.

(Ominous music)

Detective, I don't
know what to tell you.

I've been trying to get in
contact with her all day.

I've called her like 50 times
and her phone's been off.

That's really weird.

Yeah, Sarah can't
live without her phone.

Is there anyone
you can think of

who might wanna hurt Sarah?

Anyone she was seeing?

An ex-boyfriend?

There was...

Ladies, I'm gonna
tell you something

and I need you to
brace yourselves.

We found Sarah's
body this morning.

She was murdered.

What?
Oh my god.

Whatever you know
you need to tell me

so we can find out who did this.

I mean, she was seeing
someone, here on campus.

It wasn't just someone.

It's a professor who works here.

Richard Borgan.

(Light dramatic music)

(Student crying)

Maggie.

What's going on?

Someone murdered Sarah Ellet.

What?

I just, I can't believe it.

You knew her well?

She was, she was a student.

I'm gonna stop
you right there.

It would best if
you were honest.

Take a moment, I
will ask you again.

How well did you know Sarah?

Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't...

Detective Gerardy,
this is my wife.

We won't be long, Mrs. Borgan.

Just a few questions.

Okay.

I will meet you at home.

Actually, would you
mind waiting outside?

I'd like to talk to you as well.

Wait, why?

Because I want to.

Is that all right
with you, Mrs. Borgan?

Of course.

So, when did the affair begin?

(Ominous music)

[Male professor] Don't go yet.

Don't go, don't
leave, don't leave.

Rough day?
What are you doing here?

I told you to-
I know, but I just wanted

to say I'm here for you
if you need to talk.

I heard what happened and I know

the police suspect your husband.

What do you mean?

Mags, come on.

He's the obvious suspect.

She was talking, not
keeping their secret.

He kills her to keep her quiet.

No, he would never do that.

Would it be the
worst thing if he had?

What?

I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

But I can't help how I feel.

Thanks for your
help, Dr. Borgan.

Mm hm.
I'm gonna get on

that paper right away.

Who was that?

I, uh, a student.

Whenever you're
ready, Mrs. Borgan.

Yeah.

[Male professor]
Okay, week two.

Strangled, numerous
injuries postmortem.

Postmortem?

Stabbed over 25
times after she died.

Crime of passion.

That's what the textbook says.

Your husband home
Wednesday night?

I don't know, we're separated.

For how long?

A few months,
three, three months.

Since you found out about
his affair with the victim?

Since he told
me about her, yes.

Does your husband
have a temper?

He didn't have
anything to do with this.

(Maggie sighs)

Text message from Richard
borgan to Sarah Ellet,

11:03 P.M., "we need
to talk now," all caps.

Response from Sarah Ellet,
"want me to come over?"

A few hours later
her body's found.

You pulled his phone records?

We do that when
someone's murdered.

We pulled yours
too, Mrs. Borgan.

The betrayed wife,
that's pretty textbook.

Well, it's Dr.
borgan, detective,

and I helped write the textbook.

Thank you for your
cooperation Mrs., Dr. Borgan.

If you decide to tell me all
the things you aren't saying,

give me a call anytime.

Thanks.

Why are you here?

I didn't go inside.

Maggie, I'm a suspect
in a murder case.

Want a drink?

No.

That detective,
she thinks I did it.

Did you?

Are you serious?

Who stands to benefit
the most from her death?

This isn't one of
your classes, Maggie.

I'm not some criminal
for you to profile.

You texted her the
night she disappeared.

Because you told
me to deal with her!

I didn't mean kill her!

Maggie, it's me.

How could you believe that-
I couldn't believe

that you would
cheat on me either.

So, if this year has
taught me anything,

it's that I have no idea
what you are capable of.

So why don't you just
tell me the truth.

Did you do it?

Did you do it?

(Somber music)

I've really lost
you, haven't I?

Jenny, I-
dad, wait, dad!

Jenny...
Dad!

Dad!

Dad, wait!

Dad!

(Ominous music)

(Car engine rumbling)

(Door slamming)

Jenny, stop.
What's wrong with you?

Why do you keep
driving him away?

He wants to come back.

He told me that he does,
you're just too bitter.

You don't know what
you're talking about.

Okay, then tell me.

What's going on?

Why did you kick him out?

What's really happening?

I don't wanna
pull you into it.

Okay, well this is my life

and the two of you
are ruining it!

Jenny.

Your father had an affair.

You're lying.

He wouldn't do that.
He did.

And it went on for months.

I didn't kick him out,
he left me for her.

Why didn't you tell me?

There's more.

It was Sarah Ellet.

The girl that was murdered?
Yes.

And you think that he did it?

(Maggie sighs)

No, but the police do.

I don't care about the police.

Dad would never hurt anyone,
let alone kill anyone.

(Maggie sighs)

(Somber music)

Hey, it's me.

Listen, something really
terrible has happened

and I need to talk to you.

Just call me when you can.

I miss you.

(Rock music)

I'll take a beer and whatever
my friend here is drinking.

No, Iâ€™m, I'm good.

Get him one.

You look like you
could use another.

Thanks.

I guess you're upset
about Sarah, huh?

It was a shock to everyone.

I mean who would kill such
a sweet girl like her?

Wait, I've uh,
I've seen you before.

Yesterday.

Yesterday in the hall with my-
your wife.

Mags and I are really close.

I was there for her after
you ran off with Sarah.

What did you just say?

I mean, why would you do that?

You have this amazing woman
and you leave her for Sarah?

Sarah's a child.

Well, she was a child.

(Suspenseful music)

[Richard] Who are you?

I'm the man who's gonna
take your wife from you.

(Fist thudding)
(Richard grunting)

Hey, come on,
get him off of him.

(Richard groaning)

(Dramatic music)

You aren't a victim.

You wanna press charges?
Yes.

Are you sure?
Absolutely.

Okay.

Hey, this guy's
gonna press charges.

Hands behind your back.
Wait, what? Hey!

Hands behind your back.
Hey!

[Officer] You have the
right to remain silent.

Anything you say can and will-
hey come on he provoked me.

[Officer] Be used against
you in the court of law, sir.

(Handcuffs clicking)
(Ominous music)

(Door creaking)

Wanna tell me what happened?

Not especially.

Hm, you get into a bar fight?

Seriously, I think you
owe me an explanation.

That's funny, I
feel the same way.

Who's Kyle McCarnick?

He's in my class.

He's more than that
though, isn't he?

What's that supposed to mean?

I beat the hell out
of him last night,

and he's pressing charges.

You assaulted a student?

Did you have sex with him?

(Somber music)

Tell me!

Once, it was a mistake.

After all the
grief you gave me

for sleeping with my student.

I didn't know, okay?

He lied to me.

And we were separated!

Oh, no you-
no, no, no,

you don't get to do this!

You don't get to
demand answers from me.

You left me!
What was it, huh?

Revenge sex?
(Hand slapping)

(Richard groaning)
(Light dramatic music)

Oh my god, I, I'm sorry.

Yeah, no, Iâ€™m, I'm sorry.

For what I did, I don't have
the right to question you.

I've ruined everything and
now I've ruined my career.

You know what,
you don't know that.

Are you kidding me?

The cops already think I had
something to do with Sarah's

death and now I'm arrested
for assaulting a student?

There's no coming back
from that, Maggie.

I'm ruined.
(Maggie sighs)

(Fist knocking)

Oh, Kyle.

Looks worse than it is.

Come in.

[Maggie] We need to talk.

Ever since your
husband beat me up?

You want me to drop the charges?

Yes.

He really doesn't deserve you.

Did you instigate
what happened?

Did you tell him about us?

And that's what I believe
they call victim blaming.

Okay, I'm just
gonna start over.

What Richard did
was wrong, okay?

I just think that
he's in shock over-

his girlfriend's murder?
(Maggie sighs)

Why would you even defend him
after what happened to Sarah?

You know everyone thinks-
no, no.

He didn't have anything
to do with that.

If you say so.

So, drop the charges?

Yes.

Look, if you don't he's
gonna lose his job.

I would assume.

Come on, Kyle,
please don't do this.

What do I get?

I'm sorry?

I'm giving you
something you want.

What do I get in return?

What do you want?

I want you to tell
me about the butcher.

(Eerie music)
What?

And I wanna know everything.

Things you didn't
put in the book.

I know it, there has to be more.

Tell me about your escape.

Tell me how you got away
from Cordell ray Colton.

What, what are you...

This again?

Yes, this again!

How did you get away?

How did you beat him?
Okay, just calm down please.

I'm sick of this.

You use me, ignore me,

then show up at my door
when you need something.

That doesn't feel
very good, Maggie.

It certainly doesn't feel fair.

Look, you're in my class,
you've heard my lectures,

you've read the book,
you know the story.

I want to know how it felt.

Did he cry out when you
struck him with the hammer?

Did he bleed?

Did he lose consciousness?
What?

One of the most
prolific serial killers

in American history and you are

the only woman who ever escaped.

Why do you think that is?

Tell me and I'll drop the
charges against your husband.

He made a mistake.

He got distracted.

I saw my chance, I took it.

It's that simple.

Because you knew he
was going to kill you?

Everybody had heard
about those girls.

So, yes, I knew if I didn't
fight, if I didn't run,

that I would end
up just like them.

Pretty brave.

I think it's why
I'm so drawn to you.

No, just stop, please
just drop (panting).

Drop the charges.

One more thing.
I just did what you asked.

It's a small thing.
(Maggie sighs)

A kiss.

One last kiss.
That is not gonna happen.

What could it hurt?

We've done way more than that.

(Light eerie music)

You walk away now and tomorrow
I file a lawsuit against

the university for
Richard's right hook.

And unfortunately for you,

our night together
will probably come up.

Are you blackmailing me?

Call it what you want.

I think I deserve something for

the mistreatment I've endured.

One kiss.

No!

Not like that!

Like you mean it.

No.

Fine, forget it.

Wait.
(Light dramatic music)

What the hell?

A little memento.

I cannot believe I thought
you were a good person.

I can be very charming.

Just do what you promised
and drop the charges.

Thanks for stopping by, mags.

(Ominous music)

[Man] 911, what's
your emergency?

Yes, I'm calling about
the Sarah Ellet killing.

I know who did it.

[Becky] Professor
borgan, may I have a word?

Oh, come on.

Look, I'm late for class and
this is harassment, detective.

This is a search
warrant, professor.

Would you open your car?

(Light eerie music)

What's going on?
I have no idea.

(Dramatic music)

Officer, take professor
borgan into custody.

Ma'am, back up, please.
What?

Back up, please.
Wait, wait, why, why?

Please, back up, ma'am.
Professor borgan,

you're under arrest for
the murder of Sarah Ellet.

No, no, Maggie!
Hands behind your back.

Hands behind your back.
Maggie, I did not do this.

All right, all right.
Stop resisting.

[Becky] You need
to calm down, sir.

Get off!
This is how people get hurt.

Maggie, it's not true!

I don't know how that
got there, you hear me?

Get off!

(Ominous music)

Richard did not
kill Sarah Ellet.

I wish I could agree with you.

I have a doctorate
in forensic psychology.

Could we at least discuss
the case on its merits?

As professionals.

Well, technically,
I'm a professional

and you're an academic, but
sure let's look at my case.

I just pulled what appears
to be the murder weapon,

matching tape and matching rope

from the trunk of my
prime suspect's car.

That's what we
call hard evidence.

Then there's the way
we found our victim.

Similar to a case your
husband knows quite well.

What do you mean?

The victim was
hogtied, wrist to ankles.

A handcuff knot?

That's right.

Just like the east bay butcher.

Why did you search
my husband's car today?

Anonymous tip.

Okay, there's a
student, Kyle McCarnick.

I think he's involved.

The young man your
husband assaulted at a bar?

That's convenient.

Well, you know what
else is convenient?

An anonymous witness
who saw the killer toss

the murder weapon
into his trunk.

And some additional
inconvenient facts.

Kyle is stalking me.

And he's obsessed
with the serial killer
Cordell ray Colton.

So, maybe he's a more
likely murder suspect than

a middle-aged English professor
with no history of violence.

But I'm just an
academic, what do I know?

Oh and you know what?

My husband, he couldn't
tie a handcuff knot

if his life depended on it.

Ask anyone.

The judge is gonna
set bail next week,

and we'll get him out then.

How are you so calm right now?

Hey, I know you're upset-
upset?

Dad's in jail for murder.

I'm a lot more than upset
and you don't even care!

Jenny!

Congratulations, mom.

You got what you wanted.

Dad's gone and he's
probably never coming back.

This isn't what I want.

I'm just trying to deal
with the situation.

The survivor?

Control freak until the end.

(Maggie sighs)

Hey, where are you going?

Away from you!

(Door slamming)
(Light dramatic music)

[Man on CD] I have
an infinite capacity

to receive and respect.

I have an infinite capacity
to receive and respect.

I have...

(Light dramatic music)

(Fist knocking)

Kyle McCarnick?

That's me.

My name's Gerardy,
detective Gerardy.

May I come in?
Sure.

What can I do for
you, detective?

[Becky] I saw you
the other day talking

with Margaret borgan.

[Kyle] I have a
class with Dr. Borgan.

Looked like a
tense discussion.

I was trying to
negotiate myself

into a higher grade on a paper.

How'd that work out for ya?

Not sure yet.

She's a hard woman to nail down.

Pretty fancy place
for a college student.

Well, it's good to
have a family with means.

I'm investigating the
murder of Sarah Ellet.

Know her?

No, but I saw it on the news.

Just terrible.

Where were you
Wednesday night?

I thought you had
arrested someone?

Indeed we did, Kyle.

Our murder suspect is
the man who assaulted you

the other night.

But I'm sure you know that.

You watch the news.

Seems like you got a
dangerous man off the streets.

Thanks to an anonymous tip.

Mind if I use your
restroom, Kyle?

Sure, right over there.

(Light dramatic music)

My god.
(Suspenseful music)

(Taser zapping)
(Becky groaning)

(Ominous music)

(Becky groaning)

The more you struggle,
the tighter the rope pulls.

That's the genius of the design.

You can't get out.

Please don't do this.

But I want to.
(Becky panting)

(Becky screaming)

[Reporter] An arrest
has been made tonight

in connection with the death of

Rose state university
student, Sarah Ellet.

News seven has learned
that Richard borgan,

a tenured professor at
Rose state has been taken

into police custody on
suspicion of murder.

It's alleged that borgan
(Door thudding)

Was engaged in an
extramarital affair with Ellet

prior to her tragic death.
(Light dramatic music)

(Jenny gasps)
(Dramatic music)

(Phone buzzing)

I'm not finding him locally.

Try Boston.

He said he was from Boston.

Mom, where are you?

I think someone's (gasps).

(Light dramatic music)

(Jenny gasps)
(Suspenseful music)

Okay, I've got something here.

This victim was tied
with rope, strangled,

stabbed repeatedly postmortem.

An apparent copycat of
the east bay butcher.

(Jenny sighs)
(Light eerie music)

I didn't mean to scare you.

My dad's in jail.

Why haven't you returned
any of my phone calls?

I'm sorry, but I came
as soon as I heard.

It's gonna be okay.

Trust me.

(Lips smacking)

Okay, I've got some
workplaces on him.

This victim was female,
a Sherry roundtree.

A wealthy and prominent club
owner in the Boston area,

and this murder happened
just over a year ago.

How about club nine?

Was that hers?

He managed it around that time.

Um, there's a few clubs here.

After hours, black
cat, club nine.

Kyle knew her from club nine.

What are you doing?

Well, this is proof.

This is the same
mo as Sarah Ellet.

I'm calling the detective.

Wait, hold on.

[Jenny] Mom, where are you?

I think someone's (gasps).
Oh my god.

(Dramatic music)
What?

Jenny!

I'm up here.
Oh god.

Oh my god, come here.

I got your message and-
sorry, I got spooked.

My fault I'm afraid.

What the?
(Ominous music)

[Kyle] I accidentally
gave her a fright.

This is my friend
Kyle from school.

[Kyle] Yeah, Iâ€™m
in your mom's class.

It's nice to see
you, Dr. Borgan.

Get out.

Mom!

Get outta my house.

Now!

(Maggie gasping)

(Jenny sighs)

Kyle, wait.

Don't go.

Wait, wait, Kyle, wait, hold on.

Jenny, get back inside.

What is wrong with you?

Jenny, it's okay.

(Lips smacking)

I'll call you later.
Okay.

What do you
think you're doing?

You told me I should see
someone closer to my own age.

You stay the hell
away from my daughter.

But she's so pretty, mags.

She looks like you.

Tastes like you.
(Suspenseful music)

You leave us alone!
No!

I saw you when my husband
was getting arrested.

So?

You wanted me to see you.

You wanted credit for
what you had done, right?

Is that right?
Yeah, I know who you are now

and I'm gonna go to the police

and I'm gonna tell
them everything.

But you already did talk
to the police didn't you?

A very nice detective
came to see me.

You sent her to me.

So that makes whatever
happened to her your fault.

What did you do?

What you made me do.

Same thing that's gonna happen
to anyone you tell about me.

Why do you think Iâ€™m
here tonight, mags?

Why would I wait with your
daughter for you to come home?

To show me that you could.

Wow, your insight into serial
killers is truly amazing.

(Maggie panting)

Serial killer?

As in more than three.

I qualify now.

Thanks to that woman detective.

She put me over the top.
(Maggie gasps)

You're just so proud
of yourself aren't you?

I want you to think about that

in the precarious
position you're in.

I can touch every
part of your life;

I can send your
husband to prison,

I can seduce your daughter,
I can possess you totally.

What is it that you want?

Just to show that I'm as
good as the east bay butcher.

Better!
Ah.

So this is all about Colton?

It's about me!

You'll do what I tell you
to do because you know

there is nothing you care
about that I cannot destroy.

I own you in a way
he never could.

Which means I win.
What?

What do you win?

Don't forget, Maggie, you
talk about me to the cops again

or to your husband or
even pretty little Jenny-

oh. - I'm gonna
have to hurt them too.

No, you stay away from her.

You're really not in a
position to be making demands.

Just follow the rules and
everyone will be okay.

This isn't a game, Kyle!

Are you sure?

It feels like one to me.

(Maggie gasping)

I cannot believe you just
embarrassed me like that.

You can never see him again.

Why?

What were you and
Kyle talking about?

Look, I'm not getting
into this with you,

just know that
what I'm working on

is going to help your father.

Oh, big secrets
with the renowned

criminal psychologist, huh?

Just tell me.

What were you and
Kyle talking about?

No, honey I need you to...

You gotta trust me, okay?

Please.
Trust you?

Yeah, you can forget that.

I'm old enough to
make my own decisions,

and you cannot
tell me what to do.

Come on, Jenny.

You don't understand.

No, I agreed to
go to school here.

I agreed to live here even
though you drove dad away.

You can't control me.

Stay outta my life.

(Ominous music)

(Letter rustling)

(Light eerie music)

[Guard] I'll give
you 10 minutes.

Just stay clear of the bars.

Well, well, I thought
I'd never see you again.

I liked your book.

Though I came off as
a bit two dimensional.

I received your letter.

I've sent you many, but you
don't ever read them do you?

I've always admired
your self control.

Where'd you get that photo?

He sent it to me, of course.

Oh, so this is all you, huh?

You got one of your whacked
out followers to ruin my life?

No, Margaret, I don't
want to hurt you anymore.

When you ran away
from me that night,

I had no idea the fame
you would bring me.

Your book, it's the only reason

the world appreciates my work.

I'm an artist.

And you've provided me with

what I've always
wanted, an audience.

I don't want you dead.

So why is he doing this?

A son often struggles
with his father's legacy.

What?

My wife changed their names,
moved across the country,

for obvious reasons.

Being my son comes with
social consequences.

Kyle is your son?

I suppose in some deranged
way he wants to win my favor.

But I'm not interested
in a younger, weaker,

less interesting
person copying my art.

Homage or not, he's just a run
of the mill copycat killer.

What does he want from me?

He wants to hurt
you to hurt me.

What the hell does that mean?

Oh, you'll figure that out.

You are the criminal
psychologist after all.

You know, I've grown quite
fond of you, Margaret.

I'm getting the police.

You're gonna tell
'em everything.

Let's be clear.

I don't want you to die,

but I advise against
calling the police.

That would be cheating.

And I will be of no
help to you in that.

I want you to defeat
him, as you did me.

(Eerie music)

Fair and square.

If his plan is to kill me,
then what is he waiting for?

He wants to break you first.

By taking everything
away from you.

First your husband and...

Jenny?
I would hurry if I were you.

(Light dramatic music)

Ah, good luck, Maggie.

Jenny!

Jenny!

Jenny.
(Suspenseful music)

Oh god.

(Lips smacking)

Wait, wait.
Sure, I'm sorry.

I'm moving too fast.

You know that I want to.

I'm just going crazy
with everything

that's going on right now.

You're not crazy.

Your whole world is upside down.

Yeah, like it's your fault.
(Both chuckling)

So, what did you and
my mom talk about?

She was upset because
I'm a student in her class

and I'm older than you.

And I was just reassuring her.

You know how parents can be.

Are you close
with your parents?

Dad's been gone
since I was a kid.

And he was my hero, but
he never had time for me.

What about your mom?

With dad gone, she
just couldn't handle

being alone I guess.

She um, killed herself.

Oh my god, Kyle, I'm so sorry.

How old were you?
12.

After that there was just
foster home after foster home.

They kept getting rid of me.

Apparently I was a bad kid.

I can't believe that's true.

No one would believe it.

(Lips smacking)

(Light music)

(Fist knocking)

Wonder who that could be.

Should I?
No.

This won't take a second.

(Hand pounding)

(Maggie sighs)
Mags.

What a pleasant surprise.

Where is she?

(Ominous music)
Jenny.

Mom, what are you doing here?

Leave me alone.

It's okay, Jenny.

Just give me a sec.

I'll handle this.

Unfortunately, it seems your
daughter doesn't wanna see you.

You win.
What's that?

Tomorrow night, my place.

You and me.

I'll answer every
question you have

about the east bay butcher.

If everything is in
your book like you said,

why should I bother?

Because it isn't.

I left one part
out, out of my book,

and out of my lectures.

You're lying.

And you're gonna find it
very enlightening, Kyle.

Surprising in fact.

I still don't believe you.

Well, I'm telling
you the truth

because I know
the danger I'm in.

I know the danger
my daughter is in,

and I want it to stop.

I want you away from her now.

And if I do, then
tomorrow night-

whatever you want.

9:00 P.M., I'll be alone.

If you run.

You'll know where to find us.

Jenny.
What?

(Dramatic music)

What are you doing?

Let go, Kyle!

I'm not interested
in you anymore.

Leave me alone.
(Door slamming)

Honey.
Just take me home.

Wait, wait, I need
to talk to you please.

[Jenny] I don't
wanna talk to you.

It's important.

There are things that
you need to know.

I need to know what you did
to make him act like that.

I didn't do anything,
that's who he is.

He's been lying to you.

You don't even know him.

I do know him.

That's how I knew
how to find you.

What does that mean, mom?

How did you know where he lived?

Because I've
been there before.

Oh my god.

I made a mistake.

I didn't know he was a student.

He targeted me,
he manipulated me.

Just like he's manipulating you.

You slept with him?

You slept with Kyle?

Answer me!

I did, yeah.

What is wrong with you?

I wanna tell you
everything, honey.

I'm just, I'm trying
to protect you.

Yeah, 'cause you
and dad are just doing

a great job of
protecting me, right?

Kyle killed Sarah Ellet.
(Ominous music)

What?

That's what I've
been working on.

And I'm gonna prove it.

I can't...

I don't even know what
to believe anymore.

Hey, thank you for doing this.

Did I have a choice?

I just, I
understand and respect

that you're old enough
to do whatever you want.

Hey, Jenny.

I appreciate you.

I do not need a babysitter.

No, it's just
for tonight, okay?

I'll tell you
everything tomorrow.

Whatever.

Hey, I love you so much.

Where are you going?

Um, I'm gonna tell
you everything tomorrow.

You be careful.

Yep.

Okay.

Wait, mom.

I love you too.

(Maggie sighs)

See you soon.

Come on.

(Light dramatic music)

(Door slamming)

(Door latch clicking)

(Dramatic music)

(Eerie music)

You coulda rang the doorbell.

But what kind of
entrance is that?

You have a flair
for the dramatic.

More like an instinct
for self-preservation.

You look amazing.

All dolled up for me?

(Maggie sighs)

Well, I did tell you you
could have whatever you want.

(Ominous music)

You think I want you for sex?

That I'm some lovesick
stalker or something?

Is that what you think?

I want you for your mind.
(Maggie groans)

Not your body.

You're hurting me, Kyle.

Like he did?

Like he hurt you?

No, you're different
than your father.

Mags, you're
full of surprises.

Hm, I went to the prison.

And I saw him.

What did he say?

He said you were gonna kill me

if I didn't give
you what you wanted.

He's right.

So, what do you wanna know?

The detail I left
out of my book,

but I didn't want
anyone to know.

Tell me.

Was you.
(Eerie music)

You're the reason I escaped.

(Phone ringing)
(Cordell groans)

What?

I'm working!

This is my private time.

Is it so difficult for you
to give me a moment of peace?

Well, what's wrong with him?

Babies cry.

If you're that worried
about it call a doctor,

but don't bother
me again tonight.

I'm working on a
special project.

(Suspenseful music)

(Hammer thudding)
(Young Maggie grunts)

(Cordell groans)

You were the distraction.

You were a sick baby,
your mother was worried,

but your father didn't care.

(Young Maggie grunts)
(Foot thudding)

(Young Maggie panting)

Help!

Help me!

Cordell?

What did you do?

What did you do to him?
(Suspenseful music)

Help!

You saw me when I was a baby?

Why didn't you tell anyone?

Because you two were innocent.

No one needed to know
that you existed.

I wasn't innocent for long.

After you escaped
from that shed,

the truth came out
about my father.

My mother took me away, lied
to everyone about who we were.

About who I was.

Until she realized what I was.

And what were you?

How do most serial
killers get their

first taste for killing, mags?

Don't you know?

Killing animals.

Mom loved our dog.

Don't know if she was more
upset about the dead animal

or that her son was a killer.

The next day, she told
me who my father was,

and not to be like him.

I think she was just trying
to scare me straight.

She went in her room
and hung herself.

I was 12.

I've gone to the
prison, written letters,

he's never accepted me.

I didn't know until just now
why he's always hated me.

And why is that?

Because of me, you
escaped and he was caught.

A crying baby that he
would never forgive.

Thank you, Maggie.

Thank you for telling me that.

Can you answer
something for me?

How did you get that
detective to believe

that Richard killed Sarah?

(Kyle chuckling)

What are you doing?
(Alyssa hushes)

This is it.

You think I can't
outsmart some local cops

and your idiot husband?

Richard is not an idiot.

What is this?

Why is she here with him?
Jenny, I love you,

but shut up and listen.

Yet he's in jail right
now because of you.

I saw your argument.

I followed him to the bar.

He was weak.

So you picked
a fight with him?

By the time the cops took
him in, the bar was empty.

I popped his trunk,
left the knife,

called it in the next day.

She's getting a confession.

Now you believe he
killed Sarah Ellet?

She didn't give me a choice.

Luckily she didn't tell
anyone where she was going.

But she's a cop,
they won't give up.

So, unfortunately, I
have to be leaving soon.

That's it, that's the signal!

(Ominous music)

I need a drink.

You want one?

I don't think I want
you too far away from me.

Oh, I thought you were
just interested in my mind?

Maggie, you are fearless.

Like you've got ice water
running through your veins.

It's time for me to go, which
means it's time for you to go.

Wait, wait.

(Ominous music)

He's looking right
into the camera.

Get the police there now!

I'm still on hold, Jenny.

Funny, you don't strike me

as a Teddy bear
kinda girl, mags.

That's because
you don't know me.

I'm a softie at heart.
(Ominous music)

(Teddy bear ripping)
(Dramatic music)

I get why my
father respects you.

That's funny.

Because he certainly
doesn't respect you.

What did you say?

(Hidden camera thudding)

That's why you're
here, isn't it?

That's why you targeted
me, seduced me,

seduced my daughter, got
my husband thrown in jail,

because you're trying to
gain your father's respect

by finishing what he couldn't.

Well, it's not gonna work.

Still trying to impress daddy?

It's pathetic.

You're an embarrassment to him.

Tarnishing his accomplishments.

A shameless copycat.

He's never gonna love you.

Shut up!
(Hand slapping)

(Maggie screams)

(Suspenseful music)

It's over.

The cops are on the
way and you're going

to go to jail just
like your dad.

You got in my
head a little there.

(Kyle panting)

Don't come any closer.

I'll do it.

You did your whole
criminal psychology thing.

Okay, I'm impressed.

I mean it.

You're gonna stab me?

Don't.

I saved you!

If it hadn't been for me
you would've been victim 17.

Now look at me.

You made me the killer I am.

(Maggie grunts)
(Flesh squishing)

Oh my god.
(Kyle gasps)

You did it.

I didn't think
you had it in you.

(Maggie panting)

(Kyle groans)

Oh my god.
(Dramatic music)

(Rifle clicking)

(Maggie screams)
(Gunshot banging)

(Dramatic music)
(Maggie panting)

(Gunshot banging)
(Maggie screaming)

(Suspenseful music)

(Rifle clicks)
Dammit!

(Suspenseful music)
(Maggie panting)

Maggie!

(Suspenseful music continues)

(Door rattling)
(Keys clinking)

(Intense dramatic music)

(Ominous music)
(Maggie panting)

Back to school, mags?

How nice.

(Suspenseful music)

(Light dramatic music)

Jenny, wait!

Hold it.
My mother's in there.

No, she's not.
What do you mean?

[Alyssa] Is Maggie okay?

There's signs of a
struggle in the house,

but the house is empty.

Oh my god.

Do you think he took her?

We don't know yet.

[Alyssa] Come on,
we need to find her.

(Ominous music)
(Kyle panting)

I know what you think.

You think that I'm like him.

You beat good ole dad, then
you can certainly beat me.

(Eerie music)

I'm not my father, Maggie.

He thinks he's better
than me, but he's wrong.

I'm smarter.

I'm stronger.

You can't hide from me!
(Suspenseful music)

(Plate shattering)
(Kyle groaning)

(Kyle panting)

There's that killer instinct.

(Fire alarm blaring)

Did you hear that?

That's coming
from the university?

It's mom.

It's her, I know that it is.

(Dramatic music)
Help!

(Maggie gasps)
(Kyle grunts)

(Maggie gagging)

(Maggie groaning)

(Suspenseful music)
It's over, mads.

(Fist thudding)
(Kyle groaning)

(Maggie gasps)
(Kyle coughing)

(Maggie coughing)
(Suspenseful music)

(Kyle growling)

(Flesh squishing)
(Maggie grunts)

I told you not
to call me that.

(Kyle gasping)

(Maggie sighing)

(Sirens wailing)
(Maggie gasps)

Mom!

Oh my god!
Maggie!

(All gasping)
Oh my god.

It's okay, sweetie.

It's okay, guys.

Thank you so much, Jenny.

It's okay.
I'm so glad.

Oh, Jenny, I'm so sorry.
(Jenny crying)

It's okay.

(Door creaking)

(Soft music)

(Richard sighing)

(Eerie music)
