Wow.

Yes!

Here we are today in a
house full of friends

standing in total support of this marriage.

Betty,

you've been such a positive
force of change in this house.

And your strength and
the warmth you radiate

have brought such stability and joy

not only to Kevin, but to all of us.

We all knew from day one
that Kevin is a great guy

openhearted and kind.

But, it's been such a thrill to see

an even greater man emerge
from this partnership.

One committed to being here

in all the ways that could be interpreted.

I hope the two of you continue
to be excited by one another,

to feel at home with one another,

and to be proud and joyful
to have found one another.

Alright. Now...

Kevin,

do you take Betty to be your wife?

I do, I do, I do.

Do you take Kevin to be your husband?

Yes, I do.

I now pronounce you husband and wife.

You may kiss the bride.

What's the alcohol content in the tea?

Cause, somebody was asking me...

I mean, you can give them a vague
answer if they ask about that.

That it's not enough for it to
have to qualify for anything...

Like, if they drink the whole jar
they're not going to get a little drunk?

No.

It's like 0.0000 percent.

What's the plan for the honeymoon?

Oh, uh...
Honeymoon.

Honeymoon, yes honeymoon.

If you guys wanna head
out of the house tonight

do something on your own that's more...

Entirely up to Betty.

Yeah, I mean tonight
would be a good night.

Asking if there's
a honeymoon plan.

The lake?

Lake? Wait,
I think the first step would be Betty

actually opening the front door,

walking down the sidewalk...
That would be part of it.

Seeing the outside world for
the first time in a long time.

That will be part of it.

Yeah, at some point maybe
I'll decide to do that, okay.

Participate as some gentle neighbor
like some other people in this house.

Hey, I do a lot of work.

I clean up after all of you.

But, I'm happy here.

I don't really need to go out yet.

Honeymoon was when the moon
was at its absolute fullest

the very second it began to wane.

It was called the honeymoon
cause it was like a

pot of honey that was about
to start spilling over.

Sounds a little dirty, man.

Well, it's kind of this negative
implication that this is the

the fullest point of the marriage

and from here on it empties.
Oh, huh.

See, we're all gonna come to...
things are gonna change around again.

New mom.

Don't be offended if
I don't call you mom.

I won't.

I wanna thank you Courtney

for, especially for
everything you've done for me.

I realize that...

in a lot of ways,
I haven't been a very good father.

I think that's all gonna change now.

Cool.
Here, here.

Do you think it's different, though?

Betty? To be married,
do you feel more comfortable?

Yes. I feel happy, I feel...

This is, what a treat.

Eight candles, eight years.

On three?
Okay.

One, two, three.
One, two, three.

Pssst.
Hmm?

I don't know.

Do you think that was a good idea?

Yeah, now I do.

Keep your hands up.

Keep your hands up.
I want you to come out with jabs.

And give me a one, two, three.

Harder, harder.

Do you have any pennies
that you can put in here?

Got nothing?

Got any change in your pockets?

There you go.

Come on, jab.

Alright.

There you go.

Fuck you!

Fuck you, you goddamn cunt!

This is all your fault. Look at me.

Look at me! What do you think happened?

Fuck you.

You do this every time.

You start a fight,
and you go and get drunk.

Where's my gun? Where's my gun?
Kevin.

Where's my fucking gun?

That gun is gone.

What'd you do with it?
That gun is gone.

I'm gonna fucking kill these scumbags.

What happened?

Tell me what happened.
I told you!

Tell me what happened.

They fucking pissed on me!

They fucking pissed on me!

After they beat the shit outta me.

Took my own clothes off.

Took my own...
alright, are you satisfied now?

You know the fucking truth.

Why did they beat you?

Because I smacked her into the wall.

She started dragging me
into the fucking bar.

So, I smacked her.

And when I went to smack her
again, they grabbed me.

I don't know what happened to her.

What, what, what...

It's okay, I was okay.

I was okay.

I was okay, remember?

What'd they do with you?
That lady took me.

The lady took me.

I came back.

You're glad the cops took you away from me.

Yay. Now we know.

Now they know.

Good job, Kevin.

They know now.

So, it's as bad as it got.

It's okay.

You're all sweaty.

It's okay.

We're all here.

You don't have to keep crying.

You don't have to cry.

What do you want me to think of you?

What do you want me to think of you?

You want me to think that you're a

fucking, heartless bitch?

Don't come near me, don't come near me.

You like me.

No, I liked you. I liked you.

When you weren't a fucking mess, okay?

Don't touch me.

Yeah, yeah. My name is Tina.

My name is Tina.

It would be nice if you
knew my fucking name, okay?

It'd be nice.
I know your name.

Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina.
Okay.

I love you, Tina. I love you.
I get it.

You love me too.
I don't.

Say it. You love me.
I don't. Okay?

How am I supposed to leave when
I don't have any fucking shoes?

Let me help.

I thought you were gonna take my pillow.

Yes, I could.
What, do you have a bag you can...

Take my pillow.

This is comical.

What the fuck, Ann?

Do you see yourself?

Jesus fucking christ.

Can you please just get your shit, please?

I can put up with a lot.

And living in this house,
I have to put up with a lot.

But, I can not stand laziness.

That's the bottomline.

And that's what it is.

Bye.

What's that cocksucker doing right now?
He's on the couch.

He's not sick.

If I were to go out, he's sick.

You don't have to go around.

I mean, ask Jim... why Gene sits around.

Why he doesn't help you and
get off his fucking ass.

Oh, you know he's not ready.

Embarrassed.

The dude is already embarrassed enough
every time he looks in the mirror.

You know what, put that in the front.

But then, I don't want anything after.

You're so stupid.

All this dude does is talk about
how he needs to lose weight.

Then what'd he do?
As soon as the bread dish came out,

One, two, three, four...

It's like, you know
what, it feels like he...

Don't complain, and then...

do exactly what's causing the thing
you're fucking complaining about.

It's like,
if I have to listen to you bitch,

at least fucking do something about
it, and shut the fuck up.

It's a place where we all
live and choose to be sober.

Choose to live together,
choose to be sober.

That sounds like some weird, hippie shit.

A tonic of love, wow.

Is this like a joke?

Hey, you're the fucking
joke you fucking poser.

Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you trying to sell a fucking product?

Or are you coming up here and you're
trying to fucking start shit with me?

Like, I didn't fucking do anything.

It's a fermented, healthy drink.

What kind of drink was it?
Basically, it's like a tea.

Five dollars, I don't know if I could...
It's a tea.

It's made, it's infused... it's um...

like an infusion,
it's sort of made from a fungus...

actually, it's very interesting.

Yeah, it's derived from, um...

medicinal drinks from the east.

I've kind of perfected the recipe here...

So, where do you ferment this?
Like, in your backyard?

Um, yeah, in my home.

Would you like to try a little bit?

I'm gonna fucking do it.

What does it taste like?
What does it taste like?

It tastes a little bit funny.
It's a little unfamiliar at first,

but it's really delicious, it's like...

I'm not gonna throw up, right?
No, not at all, no.

Alright.

I dare you to fucking drink it.

Sorry, do...

Yeah, it's...

Um, Lucy can help you up.

Take a photo of your guitar.

Take your fucking guitar.

That's the place he likes to be.

I think we're getting
some fucking drugs today.

I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

Uh, so we're selling this.

This is uh, um...

It's a fermented tea.

It's a health drink.
Fermented tea?

Yeah. Would you like to try it?
Yeah.

You guys made this yourself?
Yeah.

We, um... we live in a house.

It's a sort of sober-living home.

How are things coming?

Things are good. Yeah.

Things are really kinda clipping on nicely.

So, yeah.

How much do you need this time?

Um, I just need like... twelve?

Okay.

And, how's your wife?

Lucy's good, yeah.
Yeah?

Everything's going well, yeah.
It's been a...

we've been on a good streak, so...

I'm glad.

Staying off the bottle?

Staying off the bottle.

Looking for work?
Looking for work.

I don't want you to end
up like your father.

You promise?
I promise.

Okay.

How you been?

Okay. I won't be here forever, so...

You gotta think about what
you're gonna be doing.

You can always come here to work.

Alright.
Alright?

I appreciate it, Marge.

I'll see you soon.
Alright.

Love you.
Love you too.

Oh, say hi to Duane on your way out.
Alright.

Jim, Jim.
I wanna move to the house with you.

I know you have all those women there,

I was hoping I could come...
Yeah...

I don't think that would work out.

No, I think it'd be good. It'd be a good

chance for me to meet some women...

Yeah, it's not what the
house is really for though,

and you don't really have a
problem, so...

The problem is that I'd like to
meet somebody or something...

Right, it's not that kinda house.

Okay. But, see I was wondering

cause there's a girl at the
library that I really like...

You should go to the library then.

Right, but I need some like
practice or something...

You don't get to practice at the house.

Well, how can I come over to the house?
I hear you Duane.

Look Duane, I hear you.
I just wanna go over to the house...

So, these are the house rules.

It's a little bit daunting at first,
but you'll get the hang of it.

Alright. So, rule number one is stay sober.

You can't have any drugs or
alcohol in the house, um...

Pretty firm rule.
That's why it's number one.

You must partake in all
the group activities

unless you're sick,
or if there's some other

rare reason why you can't.

If you have any debts,
warrants, medical conditions,

or anything else looming over you,
you must be upfront when you come.

You have any?
No.

Nothing?
Unh-uh.

Nobody's gonna come knocking on our door?
No.

Be healthy. So just make sure
you're exercising, sleeping,

eating, hydrating.

Don't get too worried about your fashion.

Simple and comfy attire.

Few different changes of clothes.
Jim, I can't do this.

This is completely unhealthy for me.

If you can be in a place together, and both

like, actually give this a try,
and actually try and build something,

like, you having no control
over what becomes of your life,

is something that we all have to deal with.

That was exactly the point.

I was taking control of my life.

I wanna get better too, Betty.

She's completely manipulative.

We're gonna figure it out.

Yeah.
It's gonna be fine.

I know this is tricky.
We have to get through the rules.

We're gonna have daily discussions and

meals, reenactments,
all these kinds of things.

You have to really come into
them with a certain level of

earnestness and enthusiasm and

trying to uh, just commit to being here.

Um, it's a different way of living.

Like, it'll take a few
days to adjust to it.

Betty.

Betty, where are you going?

It's gonna take a few days

for all of us to adjust to it.

Betty, what's the matter?

Nothing, nothing's wrong. I'm fine.

What difference does it
make if she comes here?

It's, I just wanna be alone.
I love you.

Thank you, I know. I love you too.

I just need to be alone. Okay?

You know the Heimlich maneuver.

We invented it.

Who would you eat first
at this dinner table?

Which one of us would you
eat if you were cattle?

C'mon, that's a load of questions.

I'd probably eat you first.
Why?

To shut you up.

You daughter is here. Have some respect.

Right? Right?

Well, he started it.

He's a twelve-year-old.

When I'm around him,
I'm a twelve-year-old boy.

You sure got some good
looking potatoes, Betty.

Betty, domesticate your animals.

Please.
He can do what he wants.

Eat with a dagger.

How did you and Betty meet?

Do you wanna tell them?

No. Why?

Okay.

Well, we met at a show.

And...

Deep sigh.

Yeah, really.

We met at a show...

um... and...

I noticed her, she's getting

harassed by some

like, some photographer, I dunno.

They're gonna get into a fight.

I dunno, I didn't see what happened
before, but all I saw

was this girl just fucking

knock this fucker out.

Right hook?
Yup.

Then you saw fireworks?
Yes.

It's not really what happened.

Yes it is.
No it isn't.

Yes it is.
No.

I was taking pictures.

This guy was moshing. Sorry...

Um, this guy was moshing.

And he bumped into me, knocked my camera

fell on the floor, cracked the lens.

And then I was yelling at him

and he pushed me, and so I punched him.

Wow. Yeah.
Because he pushed me.

Did you really knock him out?
Yeah.

You fucking fell over...
Good for you.

Did he lose any teeth?

Ann? I just wanted you to know that...

we're all a community here.

We're all one big family.

So, this is the room that you'll stay in.

Everything that you'll
need is in this bucket.

And then the bleach is up here.

So, really all you have to do is pour...
What's in the bathtub?

Uh, that's the fermented tea.

So, probably about that much.

You know, you didn't have
to come to a place like this

if you wanted to escape me.

You're so full of shit.

Go find your own life.

Right.

Go if I know. And you know.

I missed you.

It doesn't make any fucking sense.

She just leaves like that way.

I've been supporting her.

I've been going along
with everything she says.

I mean, I haven't been fighting with her.

I've been treating her good, you know.

At least you guys only married a couple
of days, it'll be easy to get used to.

If it was thirty years or something,
I could understand, but...

Shit.

Ah shit man.

The fuck.

That's fucking why, her!

That fucking cunt.
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

I'm gonna shove my fucking fist up
your fucking goddamn fucking cunt!

Get her outta here,
or I'm gonna fucking kill her.

Fuck.
Stop it.

Stop it.

She'd better stay outside.

I'm gonna get her fucking shit

and I'm gonna throw it out in the lawn.

Fuck.

Fuck.

Fuck.

Relax.

Try to breathe.

Are you alright?

I didn't know she would leave.

Sorry.

Yeah, well you did it last time?

Yeah.
Well, there's a lot left to do.

You must've missed stuff on the
list, because...

No.

The list is right there
underneath all the fruit.

And just as Jim told me to,

When I buy something, check it off.

When I get to the house and
I put it in the cabinet,

put a line through it.

Alright then we...
You can check it.

It's right there.

I believe you. I'm not...

I'm just saying then we have
gone through an extraordinary...

The keys are in there.

They're going to the store.

Stop taking those midnight
walks in the kitchen.

What did you say?

I don't go for midnight
walks in the kitchen.

Yes.

Okay.
It's okay.

Okay.
It'll be fine.

It goes in the back drawer.

Are you ready?

Yeah.

Just go, I'm sorry.

I gotta get off.

You know what to do. You know what to do.

Come on, just go. Just go.

Come on.

Okay Kevin.

What?

What?

Oh, fuck me.

I'll go down on you for twenty dollars.

Twenty dollars?
Yeah.

I can do that.
Okay.

When I hit my head on concrete.

I cracked my skull, and some blood got in.

And now I'm epileptic.

I take medication, pills.

I also woke up...

with blood coming out of my nose...

and cum all over my chest.

How'd you get cum on your chest, Gene?

He stood over me and finished.

Was that your first time, Gene?

Yeah.

Did you get the twenty bucks?

No I didn't, Al.

Thank you.

Good job, Gene.

Ann?

Good job.

You think you would want to share next?

Right now?

Yeah, I just feel like...

Um, no I think I'm okay.
Okay, part of the...

rules that you've agreed to

had a part about that you would participate

in all group activity, and so far
you've just been a spectator and...

I think I'll wait, if that's alright.

You're not gonna participate?
Not today.

Alright, well would you go
and clean the bathroom then?

â™ª Love transcends â™ª

â™ª love can win â™ª

Al. You missed a spot.

There's still gravy on the pot.

So, what are you trying to say Kevin?

The way I feel right now,
it would be easy enough to say maybe.

The most I could say.
And even that would be bullshit.

If you stay you think you'll relapse.

I mean, right now, maybe I could say maybe.

That's the most I could
say, maybe I can say is...

I could stay straight, if I... but...

Right now, I don't give
a shit about any of that.

I'm gonna get high right now.

Kevin and anybody else
who decides to bring drugs

or do drugs while living here

they have to leave, and they know that.

And that's why I don't think
this is because Betty left.

I don't think that he's gone because...

you know, you have to know
that this house is good for you

this house does care for you.

He was still like a dad though

like in a lot of ways,
like when we were both

using at the same time,
like he never tried to

hole me out, and I know a lot
of other dads who did that

when they knew their daughters were
using, cause you just

were like a parent, like you become a teen

and if your kid can provide
something, then you ask them to

and he never, he knew that
other people were doing that

and he never asked me to do that.

You want one of these?

Jim looks kind of hungry.

Can I talk about my lowest point?

Well, so...

about two years ago, I was standing
outside of Penn Station one night,

I had just gotten paid,
so I had money in my pocket.

This guy comes up to me,
and he's like "you know what?"

"I'll suck your dick for twenty bucks."

I never had a guy suck my dick
before, but I figured you know...

If you close your eyes,
a mouth's a mouth, right?

So I'm like, "Alright cool,
where do we do this? Where do we go?"

We round halfway down the block.

And I was worried about cops.

The guy just got down on his knees.

Unzipped my pants, he started going for it.

He was terrible.

This dude starts groaning.

I'm like, "I thought I was
supposed to be having fun here."

I don't see what the purpose of this is.

What I'm supposed to be paying for.

And I don't know what happened,
it was an involuntary bodily reaction

I just kind of like, kneed a little bit

and it was like wrestling,
he just like jumped back.

He fell, and he hit his
head on the pavement.

And I think he started
bleeding, I saw some blood.

And he started convulsing,
like he was possessed.

He take his hand, back of mine

and he's looking,
and he's got blood on his hand.

Hey.

I got it.

Hey.

Fuck!

Fucking waste of my time, man.

This fucking,
I could go play music by myself.

I don't need a fucking circle of clowns.

If you're not gonna play,
then what's the fucking point?

Alright, just fucking play man.

Alright, alright.

Is this a group sing-along,
or is this a group sing-along?

Let's not all sing.
We'll sing.

You weren't singing.

You guys, anyone think he
should be allowed to stay?

You do.
Of course I do.

Okay. Does anybody else?

I would've liked to see him
get a second chance, yeah.

That's another yes. Okay.

Do you understand why he had to leave?

Cause he broke the rule.

He broke the rule,
but he also brought drugs...

I mean, beyond just being a
rule, he broke rule number one.

He brought drugs into a house,
when people are trying to avoid it.

I think we're being selfish.

There's somebody here
who's probably gonna be

more affected by this than
anybody, right?

Yeah.
Right? Your father?

How do you feel right now?

How do you think I feel?

That's why I'm asking.

Kevin's freed.

What do you mean, Kevin's free?

That's what I mean, he's free.

He's made his choice.

Kevin made the choice?
Kevin made a choice.

Jim?
Yes.

How do you feel about it?

I feel sad that Kevin's gone, but...
Thank you.

I don't feel that he should be here.

But, at least you feel sad that

I mean, things were better.
We do not feel sad.

I'm not saying we. He's a separate
person than you, is he not?

He's the owner of the house.
I'm asking him.

He's a separate entity.

You implied that others weren't sad
because Jim said that he was sad.

No, I did not.

Don't tell me what I implied.

I didn't imply anything.

I'm just saying he's a sentimental guy.

He feels bad that Kevin's gone.

Now, her father...
If you're not sentimental, then say it.

"I feel sad" and then
continue the sentence.

You say, "We had good times two days ago."

That's sentimental.

Lucy, stop.
Yeah, really.

Down boy.

I understand the idea
of being compassionate.

That's what I wanna talk about,
that's why I'm sad that Kevin's gone.

At the same time,
I'm no saying rule number one

is the main thing about
what we're doing here.

I think the house is mostly, I hope that
we don't revolve just around these rules.

I hope that we can break
past, and we just see

that only thing in this house
is the rules and the structure.

That said... call it whatever you want.

You can't bring drugs into this house.

If you do, you don't get to stay there.

I was very clear with everyone
here on day one that they got here.

Right. So now he's gone.

What if I bring a bunch of whores
in here and start fucking them?

Is it the same thing?

I don't know.

I don't know either.

Yeah Lucy, how do you think about that?

Bunch of whores in your house.

Now it's my house?

Well, you're "we" aren't you?

You and Jim.
I wasn't a few moments ago.

You're impossible.

Jim, I love you, but I don't know where
you picked this chick up. I'm sorry.

Get your fucking hands off me!

Make up your mind!

Get your hands off me.

Is it my house or is it not my house?

I'll snap you like a twig you little bitch.

Fuck.

You little whore.

You think you can hurt me?

I can rip you into fucking pieces!

I don't care, I'm not gonna leave you!

I'm not gonna fucking leave you!

You can't leave, you can't leave.

Put it down, alright Lucy?

It's a fucking butter knife.

Thanks.

Hello?

Wait, who are you?

This is Todd.
Wait, who are you?

This is Todd.

I'm calling on behalf of the
Wounded War Veteran's Foundation.

I was wondering if you had just a second to
talk about making a small donation today?

My sister-in-law's a wounded war veteran.

I'm so sorry to hear that.

Well then, you may be
interested in making a donation.

You can do a flat rate now, or

you can make a donation
for twenty dollars...

That sounds,
you know I have to speak quietly

because my grandfather's
sleeping in the room next to me.

Hey, we're gonna take a little drive.
Can I get the van keys?

You can't take the van.
Why?

We're going grocery shopping.

We can do the grocery shopping.

That's okay.

Hey.

Lucy.

Hey, how's it going?

Lucy, this is my girlfriend Tracy.

Tracy, this is Lucy.
Hey.

How you been? You look very good.

All grown up, doing your shopping.

You look healthy.

I've got Tracy here.
We've been together for six months.

I say seven months, she says six months.

I figure the more the better though,
cause life's a dream with her.

Let's get out of here.

No, I'll just be a second.
Can you meet me over in the cereal aisle?

I need to pick up some Applejacks.

Lucy, what's it like, you know?

Like, you go about doing
your everyday stuff.

What's it like to be a truly
awful, horrible person?

A despicable person.

Lucy, look at me. Lucy.

You wouldn't give this to me earlier,
so look at me now. What's it like?

How long did you think you'd go
without, without, without...

How long did you think you'd go, hey hey...

You're in public. Don't make a scene.

It's ugly.

Alright, look. Do the world a favor.

Don't have children.

Hi.
Hi.

Hi Lucy.

How are you?

I'm fine.

Good.

What's going on?

Well...

I have some bad news.

Kevin OD'ed...

and he's gone.

He died.

I'm sorry.

So, um...

Kevin's ex-wife left me the information

about the funeral.

So, if you're interested
I have that information.

I was thinking that it made a
little bit more sense for us to

just have something here at the house.

To sort of celebrate his life

rather than attending the actual
thing that she's putting together.

Is Courtney gonna go?

I don't know.

I would hope that she
would want to stay here.

You know, Kevin got married in this house.

It seems to make sense to have...
the funeral at the house.

If Courtney's gonna go, we should go.

Alright, well...

All of your are obviously
welcome to go to that.

I will not be attending, and...

seems like we could do something
a little bit more productive here.

That's a big decision to make for
her, though.

I'm not making it for her.

And I love that, you know this idea that

if she goes,
you will go there in solidarity.

For me, I would think that at least one

would hope more of you would
stay here and actually honor

the way that Kevin lived his life.

Funerals are for the living.

You know, you go there to
support the people who are there.

It's not about the guy who died.

It's not about us.
It's about the people who need people.

The people who need the support, right?

Most people...
look, I've been through this already.

When most people are down,
they see people they know,

they see people who care about
them, it lifts their spirits.

And I can remove myself enough
from my feelings for Kevin,

from my feelings about funerals

to just be there for the
people who might need help.

Alright, alright. Do whatever you...

I don't know why we're suddenly acting
like we're all this conventional people

who have to do what they're supposed to...

I'm just saying that I
thought that maybe...

it's so surprising that um...

people are even really interested in...
Well, we're not interested.

The man died, you go to a funeral.

Nobody wants to go.

But, that's like the idea
of what you're supposed to do.

But, this is...
Lucy, are you gonna go?

Yeah.

We should've never kicked
him out of the house.

Separated him from us as family.

Separated him from his daughter,

and put him back out there
in the cold by himself.

We should've tried to bring him back in.

I would've wanted somebody
to help me come back in.

I think we did a bad thing.

We did a bad thing.

Thank you, Al.

Those are the nicest words I've heard
out of your mouth since I've been here.

Did anyone else hear Younger take a fart?

I did.

And sometimes you get it.

You wanna crack up at funerals,
but you're not supposed to.

And when he did that I was
like, oh my god I'm gonna lose it.

Laughter's life.

Tears are a life from laughter.
You're right, you're right.

It's true.

Lucy, you're not worried?

No.

When's the last time you
pulled something like this?

Do you know where Jim is, Courtney?

I don't know. I don't know where he is.

I don't wanna throw up.

I don't wanna throw it out.

Are you bulimic, Courtney?

I don't know.

I'm saying this in the best way possible.

Does she look like a bulimic person?

I'm serious.

Don't take it personally.
I don't think girls should be skinny.

I think the most important thing...

that you can seek in a
woman is enjoyment of food,

because if you enjoy
food, you enjoy pleasure.

And if you enjoy pleasure,
I will enjoy your company.

Courtney's trying to do a reenactment.

I think Courtney needs...

Fuck.

Call 911.

Someone get some milk.

We gotta let her stomach...

Someone call an ambulance.

She fucking drank bleach.

Is there any milk?

Yeah, yeah.
Get some milk.

You're gonna be alright.

Get the fuck off me!

I was talking to uh... cause when
I was at bookclub I was thinking

we could also do a bookclub,
and that's gets like

women love to read, cause you know

the library, stuff like that, so if like

I was thinking we could start a bookclub

and people will have to come to the
house, cause we'll all go to the party

and, um...

and we'll have food for them.

I'll have food for them,

and it'll be like oh great you have food.

This is really nice.

You know how to treat a girl.

And we'll be like, yeah we do, and we read.

And they'll be like, oh that's amazing.

I like you a lot.

I think that'll be really effective.

And like, it'll be really good.

We could read, um... what do girls read?
