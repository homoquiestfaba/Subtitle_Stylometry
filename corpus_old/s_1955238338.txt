<i> they're the men who killed me.</i>

 <i> Some families</i>
 <i> are blessed with great genes,</i>

     <i> and the dandridge sisters</i>

    <i> But they're not the reason</i>

<i> How did this sweet-faced woman</i>

<i> Well, it began six months ago.</i>

      -<i> [ men whooping ]</i>

 Hey, baby, that's really nice
 of you, sweetie, but we already
 have some food here.

   - what are you doing in here?
   - trying to watch the game
   that's right behind you.

   My book club is meeting
   in here tonight.

          Baby, remember when we
          talked last month?

         You said it was okay
         if we watched the game.

 Oh, yeah. Eva changed all that.
 She was supposed to tell you.

       - well, she didn't.
       - hey, it's the men.
       What are you doing here?

       <i> Are you joining our</i>
       <i> book club? It's gonna</i>
       <i> be very enlightening.</i>

          <i> Sweetness, precious,</i>
          <i> listen.</i>

   Would it be okay, you know,
   if you could take it
   in the other room?

-<i> Because we're all settled in.</i>
yeah, the other room.

well, I guess we could.
-<i> [ man ] you got a great girl!</i>

               I love you, baby.
  <i> [ Woman ] no! No, we cannot!</i>

           Oh, yeah-- oh.

   Michael, timothy, darrell.

   Our book club
   is reading<i> beloved,</i>

   and we're gonna need
   the television to watch
   the film when we're done.

            Oh, yeah.
            That's right, honey.
            We need the room.

      You did not tell me
      you wanted to use the room
      in my house, eva.

       Well, I'm telling you
       right now, timothy.

       And it is half
       my sister's house too.

       <i> Community property.</i>

   See, 'cause I want kareenah
   to make a good impression
   on the book club.

   <i> Don't you?</i>
                   No!

           - excuse me?
           - yes.

  Look, we were here first, eva.

       Yes, but certainly
       the temporal proximity
       of our advents...

   Isn't determinative, is it?

       - I'll get back to you
       on that one.
       - yeah.

   'Cause I don't know what
   she just said right there.

    - you don't get to me
    with your $50 words, eva.
    -<i> [ darrell ] that's right.</i>

             What would you say
             if I demanded you
             to leave this room?

               Yeah.
           Yeah.

       I would say I find
       your particular brand
       of crack very amusing.

    <i> This isn't about a book...</i>

 Versus a football game, fellas.

   Oh, no. This is about men
   versus women.

  Women who aspire to culture...

   And men who aspire
   to scratch themselves.

   Women who bear
   the burdens in life and men
   who create those burdens.

  Women who uplift humanity
  and men who uplift lap dances.

   If society were left
   to the whims of men,

  we'd still be in caves
  carving pictures
  with our non-opposable thumbs.

   <i> So, today, gentlemen,</i>

       is the day
       for civilized behavior.

   Today we women raise
   our voices against tyranny,
   crudeness and play-off games.

   <i> And that is it, gentlemen.</i>

       End of story.
       The fat lady's singing!
       Out of the room.

  <i> By the way, if any of that</i>
  <i> was lost upon you, then I've</i>
  <i> just proven my point again.</i>

           [ Chuckles ]
           Excuse me.

           Kareenah, baby,

      I am putting my foot down.

           [ All shouting ]

  Damn! Damn! I can't stand her.

       I can't stand her either,
       but you really need
       to calm down.

      You're making me stressed.
   You need to stand up
   to your wife, timothy.

  It's like she took your balls
  and turned them into earrings.

   Your wife is bling-blingin'
   with your nuts.

 <i> This is what we get for being</i>
 <i> with eva's little sisters.</i>

       They could never stand up
       to us without eva.

   I really did think
   I was getting one of
   the fabulous dandridge girls.

    I didn't know it came with
    the sister-in-law from hell.

   You gotta admit,
   they were the finest women
   in the neighborhood.

   We used to say
   their daddy's johnson--
       should be bronzed. Right.

         Did you notice
         how they stuck together
         in an argument?

  <i> One for all and all for eva.</i>
  <i> That's how</i>
  <i> they're getting down.</i>

             Come on, fellas.
             We need to be
             more compassionate.

       Their parents
       died when they were young
       and left them alone,

              so they have
              to stick together.
           Yeah.

  I should've used that argument
  to get on eva
  about that dandridge fund.

       - you know what?
       I would've done it.
       - look at you cosigning.

       Mike, please, you need to
       let that go. Every time.
               Okay.

      They've been putting money
      in that account ever since
      they were teenagers.

       - what are they doing
       with it? Nothing.
       -<i> Step away from my man.</i>

   I bet they don't even know
   how much is in there.

 -<i> There's no need for this.</i>
 - if he's your man, then what's
 he doing here with me?

           Charity work, heifer.
    Look-- look-- hey, hey, hey!

 <i> This is just</i>
 <i> a big misunderstanding, okay?</i>

   Fellas, I know that brother.
   Yo, ray!

               Hey!

       I didn't even know
       he was back in town.

       You should be mad at me,
       not each other.

   I've been dating both of you,
   and-- true, we don't
   have a commitment.

           <i> But I couldn't</i>
           <i> decide between you.</i>
       Hey, fellas.

           <i> I think</i>
           <i> he might be the man</i>
           <i> to rid us of eva.</i>

   That dude? Aw, hell, no.
   You'd be better off
   getting ike turner.

   They're about to cuss
   his ass out and leave him
   high and dry. Watch.

       - yeah, he's right.
       - let's go, ray.

   Oh, me too?
           Uh-huh.

       - get out of here!
       - be right back.

       -<i> Did you see that?</i>
       <i> Did you see that?</i>
       - wow!

   -<i> Good to see you, man.</i>
   - yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

         Fellas, he said
         he'll meet us here
         the day after tomorrow.

 So he's a freak.
 How does that help us with eva?

       - eva just needs a man.
       - come on, now.

        Remember, we tried that?
        Remember rashaun?
   Yeah.

       All I said was,
       you was a little uptight.

         But I like that though.

     So it was like a compliment
     in reverse.

   Oh, reverse. Right. I see.
       Yeah. Yeah.

                 You feeling me.
   Yeah, sure.

   Did you know that
   female spiders eat the male
   when she's done with him?

    Yeah. They date, they laugh,
    and then she turns his ass
    into a crab cake.

   Now, while the prospect
   of biting your head off
   makes me happy,

   I am sure that ultimately
   you are not a happy meal.

   So I'm moving on
   to better cuisine.

   Good-bye, rashaun.

          Eva, wait. You're just
          gonna say good-bye?

   Oh, no, it's not good-bye.
   It's hello in reverse.

             Eva. Come on, girl.

   - eva put that man
   in the mental ward.
   - you're always exaggerating.

   Eva drove the brother insane.
   I seen him last week.

Dude sound like ron hopper.
Now he t-t-talk like th-th-this.

       This can work with ray.
       The boy is a specialist.

       He is a master player.

     <i> Listen, ray can get eva</i>
     <i> to let go of her sisters.</i>

   <i> Then when it's</i>
   <i> just us and them,</i>
   <i> we can have all their love.</i>

 - right, right.
 - we can get him to seduce her.

   - yes!
   - 'cause all she really needs
   is some you-know-what.

           Hold up.
           What eva really needs
           is a sensitive man--

  somebody that can help her
  with her personality problems.

 What she needs is a dude
 that can hit that ass till
 she starts speaking in tongues.

           - amen.
           - [ Chanting ]

            Right, right, right.
            Can ray do that?
       [ Laughing ]

     <i> [ Darrell ] okay, later,</i>
     <i> after we finish doing it,</i>

   we're gonna lie together
   and hold each other
   and talk for a while, right?

            Okay. We can do it,
            but I have to study.
   Come on.

           Eva says if I stick
           to a study schedule--
   don't say the "e" word.

   - not in this house.
   - I have to stick
   to my study schedule, okay?

               All of us agreed.
   What is with
   you dandridge women?

        I love my sisters, okay?
        I'm sorry.

             I love you too.
             It's just
             in a different way.

   Okay. Then I demand that
   you love me the same way
   that you love them.

                You and them--
                it's like apples
                and oranges.

   What? Lady,
   I am your husband, okay?
   I pledged my life to you...

   Before god and a bunch
   of ugly-ass relatives
   I don't even like.

   I gave up all my wild ways
   for you, and, baby, I had
   a hell of a lot of them.

I never told you about the roses
and the butt-naked midgets
or none of that shit.

   I had midget pros
   in different area codes.
                       Uh-huh.

   Therefore, I demands
   to be a damn orange.

       You can stop playing now.
   You know what? Fine.

If a brother can't be an orange,
then you're cut off.

                   I'm cut off?
   Yeah.

                   For real?
   That's right. Back up.

           I'm cut off?
           You gonna cut me off?
   Don't touch me.

   Don't do that.
   Don't do it. Oh, damn.

        Jacqui gave me a key
        in case of an emergency.

       - are you okay?
       - don't mind us.
       We're just having sex.

  So I should just come back in,
  what, two minutes?

   - is it really important?
   -<i> Get your ass out!</i>

   - just give us one minute.
   - oh, just one minute? Damn,
   it's worse than I thought.

                 Man, what the--
      she probably had a bad day
      or something.

                Look, hold on.
                Where you going?

   Eva needs me.
       But we need you too! No--

   wait a minute! Damn you, eva!

   -<i> So, you two still talking</i>
   <i> about having a baby?</i>
   - [ Chuckles ] shh.

   Not so loud.

   If tim even hears
   the word "baby,"
   He jumps on top of me.

      Oh, that's just
      his male biological clock.

        <i> It's when a man begins</i>
        <i> having baby fever,</i>
        <i> like a woman.</i>

           I read about it
           in<i> psychology today.</i>

   All I know is that
   every time we argue about it,
   he ends up drinking.

           The drinking
           isn't serious, is it?

   No, but--

   well, you know, his father
   had a drinking problem.
                       Mm.

       Mmm. Ah!
      <i> [ Kareenah ] what do you</i>
      <i> think I should do?</i>

      I don't like getting in
      married people's business.

     There's nothing wrong
     with a grown man
     having an occasional drink.

           Mm.

       Although a study did show
       that a drinking problem
       can be hereditary.

 You don't want your baby coming
 out of the womb talking about,
 "where the liquor at?"

           It wouldn't be right.

   Oh, hey, hey, hey.
   Baby, I was still
   drinking that.

       Honey, I know,
       but you shouldn't
       drink so much, you know?

    <i> Eva and I</i>
    <i> were just talking, and--</i>

   I don't wanna breathe.
   I just want a drink.
   I want that drink.

           Baby, I don't like
           to bring up the past,

             but you know
             that little problem

  - I am not my father.
  - oh, sweetie, I know. I know.

       It's just--

   This is ray adams, y'all.
               What's happening?

       I thought you
       moved to Florida.
                   I did.

  I worked at
  a car dealership down there,
  but that was about a year ago.

           I never keep a job
           more than a year.

       - I work for jomo's meats
       in LA. Now.
       - I know jomo's.

     Why do you quit
     your job every year?
     What's that about, brother?

         Well, I have to service
         my many talents.
               Oh!

     I was brought up an orphan.
     No mama, no daddy.

    No ties. That's how I do it.

   If you guys hadn't noticed,
   ray is quite the player.

   - as we saw the other night.
   - yeah. Love your work, baby.

   <i> You ought to be exempt</i>
   <i> from taxes for that shit.</i>

       Nothing mike couldn't do.
       No, I turned in
       my player card, ray.

       I'm practically engaged
       to a beautiful woman
       named bethany.

                Congratulations.
       Thank you, thank you.

       She's gorgeous too,
       but not as fine
       as her sister, eva.

   - yeah, I can't even front.
   -<i> I wish I was good enough</i>
   <i> for eva.</i>

       - I wish I was
       her garbage, man. Look.
       - pow!

               [ Chuckles ]

       She's cute. But why is
       she scowling like that?

           Her face is so tight.
   That's her sexy smirk.

   She ain't scowling.
                   Right. Right.

       W-w-what's c-c-cracking,
       f-fellas?

               B-bitch!

               Whoa!
                       Bitch!

                       Hey! Hey!

   Back over here, man.
   Don't pay the retard--

                  the drinking--
   he got out early.
   That's all.

       Ray, how would you like
       to meet eva?

       - is she giving it up?
       - [ Together ]
       "Is she giving it up?"

  - man, she's double-jointed.
  - she's lookin' up at her feet
  every night.

   - bumping her head
   on the headboard, all that.
   - that's right.

    So I only have one QUESTION:
    What's wrong with her?

                        Nothing.
   Nothing. Nothing.

           So three grown men
           walk into a bar...

     To hook up a man
     for a perfectly good woman.

     What is it?
     She got five kids,
     a violent ex-con boyfriend?

  Is she one of those evil,
  nasty sisters who beats
  a brother down till he's dust?

   - what is it?
   - it's the ex-con thing, bro.

   - darrell!
   -<i> Ray, ray, look,</i>
   <i> I gotta be honest with you.</i>

<i> worth your while</i>
<i> to take her out.</i>
 <i> Eva is a piece of work,</i>
 <i> but we're prepared to make it</i>

       [ Chuckles ]
       You're gonna pay me
       to go out with her?

           Are you worried
           that that makes you
           look like a gigolo?

       - no. I mean, I kind
       of like that aspect.
       - okay!

                      All right.
        I'm in a financial bind.

          My landlord
          is selling my house.
          I need cash to buy it.

   Man, that is perfect.
   Then we all can benefit
   from this deal.

  Here's what we need you to DO:
  Take her out for
  a couple of months.

 Not just distract her,
 but make her fall hard for you.

       I can definitely do that.
       And I love a challenge.

       Really, she can't be
       all that bad, can she?

       Eva's sisters gave her
       a cross with jesus on it
       for her birthday.

 - the next day, jesus was gone.
 - you're kidding, right?

       No. When you do it,
       you have to make her
       fall in love with you,

     then you tell her
     you're leaving town
     and get her to go with you.

  - then you can dump her. It'll
  take her years to relocate.
  - yes!

           Time-out. I'm sorry.
           This ain't my kind
           of thing, you know.

     I'm a lover, not a con man.
     Mike, let's hang out
     sometime, okay?

       But, ray--
           get him a drink.

   Take another look at her.
              That's not a zero.

   But think about it, ray.

      <i> You just had to bring up</i>
      <i> the jesus thing.</i>

   He got muscles.
   I didn't think he'd
   be scared of her.

   <i> â™ª [ Hip-hop ]</i>

     Hey, I went out with that
     construction guy yesterday.
   The cute one?

   Mm-hmm. And you know
   we ended up in the bed.

 Did he have to take a number,
 or was the line moving briskly?

                       Ooh!
           [ Laughing ]

       No, no, tell it, please.
       Ormandy, go.

   Thank you, eva.
   Honey, he dropped his pants,

   and he whipped it out
   all proud.

   And I said, "oh, no.
   Where's the rest of it?"

           [ All laughing ]

   [ Foreign accent ]
   Ya have to put man in place
   sometime, ya hear that?

 - did she just call me a bitch?
 - right.

       [ Women cat calling ]

       - [ Wolf whistle ]
       - hey!

           Hey, baby.
   Hi, sweetie.

  Listen, eva, I need
  to have a little talk with you
  about the dandridge fund.

   Why is that, michael?
   You're not in our family.

  - but I'm almost in.
  - almost isn't in, now, is it?

 Mike, honey, do you really want
 to get into an argument...

   <i> With a woman in here, hmm?</i>

    Got some frosted mini-wheats
    in your scalp.
   Hey! You're fine.

      You're right, baby.
      You got that thing for me?
   Oh, yeah.

   Fiber? "Fiber power."

 Are you okay, mike?
 Is everything moving all right?

   He's a little irregular.
           All right. You don't
           have to announce it.

and if she can't fix you,
I know I can.
   -Hey,
   I got somethin' for that.

       You need to quit, telly,
       'cause I ain't even close
       to going your way.

 Damn. Let me call headquarters.

   <i> Hello. Yeah, it's me.</i>
   <i> Listen,</i>
   <i> take mike off the list.</i>

                       <i> Mm-hmm.</i>

                 Sixty-nine out.
               Ooh-hoo-hoo!

   I should've never
   came to this place,
   better known as "man hell."

       No, this is
       a female sanctuary.

   -Way the whole world ought to
   be. Ain't that right, ladies?
   -Mm-hmm.

               See you.
       Bye.

            Get some milk
            for them cornflakes.
   Hey.

<i> if you guys</i>
<i> are gonna get married.</i>
   <i> You should start making him</i>
   <i> take better care of himself</i>

   He should get a colonic
   or see a specialist.
   And I know a good one.

       [ Breathing heavily ]

           Hey, got your order.
           Where do you want it?

Freezer number one.
Make sure you stack them neatly.

           Excuse me.

                Hello.
                Where's leonard?

   He's sick. I'm oscar,
   the assistant manager.

     Okay, oscar,
     I'm inspector dandridge
     from the health department.

   Yes, I've heard about you.
                 Good. Then you
                 know the drill.

           Let's get clean.

           [ Beeping ]

   It does not look good, oscar.

   I found contamination
   in red zones.

   Your glass freezer door
   has a hairline break in it.

   And I found black pellets
   behind the food containers
   in the back.

        That is probably
        just graphite from
        the new units we put in.

  Your water's only 105 degrees.
                 Can you just
                 let that slide?

   The requirement is 110,
   because science tells us...

   At that temperature all
   dangerous organisms will die.

  That means in your water,
  some will live.
  And not just any germs, oscar.

 No. The bad-ass ones,
 the ones that can swim in
 105-degree-temperature water...

   And live to party on
   some child's french fries.

           We don't serve fries.
   Are you mocking me?

                      No, ma'am.
   That's good,
   because I'm not done yet.

   This entire kitchen
   gets a level-four sanitation
   or you get written up.

          What? No, that means
          it's in the newspaper.

   Thank goodness for you
   I've got a soft heart.
                       Heart?

        <i> You</i> don't have a heart.

   You got a hole with
   an ice pump in it. You know,
   I don't understand you.

   Why do you have to be
   so goddamn uncompromising?

               It's called
               principle, oscar.

             Maybe the world
             is in short supply,
             but I am not.

    People pay their tax dollars
    for my principle...

So they can go into a restaurant
and not eat chicken fried rat...

  Or bite into a bacon,
  lettuce and ptomaine sandwich.

         <i> If I slack up on you,</i>
         <i> then I have to</i>
         <i> cut everyone a break,</i>

     <i> and pretty soon,</i>
     <i> the almonds on your salad</i>
     <i> have legs.</i>

If that makes me uncompromising,
well, I wear it
as a badge of honor,

              because I'm in
              damn good company.

  Martin luther king was
  uncompromising, nelson mandela
  was uncompromising,

       and I'm sure your mother
       was uncompromising,

   although the evidence of that
   is not apparent today.

   So, why don't you think of me
   as your mom right now?

                  And mama says,
                  "clean it up!"

            See you in 48 hours.

 <i> All right.</i>
 <i> I'll go on the date with eva.</i>

   Mmm! Yes! Yes! What made you
   change your mind, ray?

                I saw her
                at a restaurant.

        If I can get that woman,
        I'll go down in
        the player hall of fame.

   [ Laughing ]
   You sure will. Okay, okay.

   So what's your price?
           I need five grand
           to get the house.

   Five thousand dollars?
   I don't know, man.
                 Hey, hey, hey--

      <i> [ Man on radio ]</i>
      <i> Forty-five, what did you</i>

   some of your energy,
   he always has it.

       - well, yeah.
       - especially if he
       popped that cherry.

           - pop, pop, pop!
           - no, no, no!

of any cherries, ormandy.

           I enjoy spending time
           with you.

       I love the way you blink.

              I love that smile.

                     I love you.

   I love you too.

  But why should a man
  buy the software
  when he can download for free?

       That is eva talking.
       That is not you talking.
   No, actually--

   jacqui said it,
   but it doesn't matter.

You know, eva took charge of the
family after our parents died.
              [ Mouthing words ]

   If we wanna have a child,
   it should be our decision,
   not eva's.

    All she said was
    that most marriages fail
    within the first five years.

         Fifty-two percent.
         We've only been married
         for three.

 If we had a baby
 and something were to go wrong,

   then there's an innocent life
   hanging in the balance
   of our failure.

   Nothing... Is going...

           To go... Wrong.

           Mmm. Hmm?

  <i> Besides, you know</i>
  <i> I didn't have a good</i>
  <i> relationship with my father.</i>

            Honey, I know, but--
           and all I want...

             Is my chance...
             To be a good daddy,

        to have
        a little brown bundle...

            Of love... And life.

             And I want it
             because I love you.

               Now, tell me,
               is that so wrong?

   Fifty-two percent.

                      [ Scoffs ]
  Honey, eva gives great advice.

  She put me through med school,
  you know?

            God, do I know that!

       You know what?
       You're not married to me.

          You're married to eva.
          I'm just a handyman
          with a penis.

       <i> Oh. Well, good for her.</i>

         Ray, I didn't know
         you were seeing anyone.

 Oh, yeah, about six months now.

   I see a friend of mine
   over there. It's nice
   to meet you. All of you.

                  What the hell
                  was that, man?

     Why did you tell her
     you had a woman?
     We gave you half the money.

        If you're thinking about
        screwing us-- mm!
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

   who another woman
   doesn't already want.

   I'll make my move.

   I need funding

      What about the five grand?
   That was my fee.

        I jumped right on it.

   - ormandy, Mr. Mason is 70.

  You give him a little viagra
  so he can handle his business,

       - you never answered

   Will you go out with me?

       Look, raymond, I know
       we just met, and you seem
       like a really nice guy,

but I think I should tell you
a little something about myself.
   Okay.

       I know the one thing
       that scares men to death.

  - what's that?
  - I know the truth about them.

    <i> And the truth is,</i>
    <i> most men don't really know</i>
    <i> what they want.</i>

       I've been through
       all the basic types.

       The playa-playas,
       who think women
       are disposable toys.

    The confused man,
    who doesn't know if he wants
    to date you or your brother.

The lazy ones, who live
with their mother and expect you
to pick up the check.

           So if you really
           wanna go out with me,

       realize that it means
       being a gentleman,

       understand that it means
       respecting my mind,
       body and spirit.

   Eva, I'm not afraid of you.

   <i> And I wanna</i>
   <i> go on record as saying</i>
   <i> I totally respect...</i>

   Your mind and your spirit.

       - what about my body?
       - it's beautiful.

   - but will you respect it?
   - I'll do anything to it
   you want me to.

   Look at that.
   The corners of your mouth
   actually turn up.

                    A smart-ass.
                    I like that.

   So, will you go out with me?

 - kareenah sure can cook, huh?
 - actually, I made those beans.

You put your foot in them, girl.
Damn, I love spicy food.

       - how about we go out
       this weekend?
       - sounds good.

           Fabulous.

          <i> [ Eva ] you're late.</i>

   They're very dangerous.
                           No.

        That's why I drive this.
   Okay.

                 I'm saving
                 to buy a house.
       Oh.

   I can understand that.
   Home ownership
   is very important.

   Does your mother live
   with you?
                       No.

   Even better.

     My boss has been hinting
     he might want to slow down,

         let somebody run
         the day-to-day for him.

               I think he might
               want me to do it.
That's great. When do you start?

          I'm thinking about it.
   There is nothing wrong
   with a little ambition.

   I was a secretary
   in my department.
   Now I'm the lead inspector.

   I gave myself
   five years to get there.
   I did it in four.

         There you go,
         doing that thing you do
         with your face again.

   Just drive
   your meat wagon, man.

              Did you hear about
              the black caveman
              they found?

        They knew he was black
        by the curve of his jaw,
        length of his spine,

      cadillac he was buried in.
      [ Laughs ]

         You tell me a joke now.
   I'm not a jokey-joke
   type person, so--

                 okay. How about
                 a little music?

   Oh, yeah. Most places

   They try to poison me.
   But this place is--
   oh, god, it's different.

  The manager has OC.D.
  Obsessive-compulsive disorder.

   He cleans all day long.
   You could eat off the floors.

              Sounds appetizing.
   Oh, you think that's funny?

   isn't prepared just right,

   your throat can close up

             Oh, I'm hungry now.

              Mmm! Just like

         - I am not eating here.
         Let's go!
         - okay. Okay.

               [ Clears throat ]

       Don't forget to validate.

          Don't be mad at me.
          I just wanted to stay.

   And have her
   put things in my food?

   I don't think so, pal.
    I just think you overreacted
    a little bit.

         You're a civil servant,
         not the F.BI.

   Well, excuse the hell
   out of me.

   Why don't you tell me
   about the demanding world
   of meat delivery?

   So, you just basically
   pick it up and deliver it
   to a guy named bob?

   Or is there some sort
   of math involved?
  You don't need to be so nasty.

  Oh, there is definitely a need
  for me to get nasty.

   My job is serious.
   It is not a hobby.

   Guess what, meat boy.
   I'm sure my job
   pays more than yours does.

   So in my eyes, the eyes
   of society and the I.RS.,

   that makes me bigger
   and better than you.

   So why don't you
   think about that
   the next time you're out...

   Doing the complex work
   of toting around a pig's ass.

   'Cause that's like
   a family thing.
       [ Phone ringing ]

   You know, with the thing--
               excuse me.

             I need to talk.

       <i> [ Phone ringing ]</i>
               Hey.

   It's eva.
            And kareenah.
            We got an emergency.

   <i> [ Answering machine beeps ]</i>

<i> And bethany. Code seven, girl.</i>

           [ Gasps ]
                   No!

   - what's up?
   - the date was catastrophic.

    Wait till I
    tell you what happened.
    This fool had the nerve to--

  - what the hell went wrong?
  - kareenah was falling in love
  with having a baby.

       And me and my wife
       were cuddling. I mean,

   I was hitting it real manly,
   and I didn't get to finish.

     They had
     a four-way phone conference
     about your date all night.

              I thought you was
              the master player.
   The master player.

  I can't get to her.
  Most women have a few barriers
  around their hearts.

    Eva has an electrified fence
    with rabid pit bulls. Okay?

   <i> And that mouth!</i>
   <i> My ears are still bleeding.</i>

   We got to do something
   about this, 'cause we can't
   have eva messing up our plan.

 Ray, listen, all you have to do
 is to find a way to get back
 on her good side. That's all.

   - he's gotta sleep with her.
   That's what you gotta do.
   - yeah, that's it.

      Look, I would love to have
      another shot with her,
      all right?

            My pride was hurt.
            But I'm sure it's
            out of the question.

     What, you don't like women?
   Watch yourself now.

you have to have sex with her.
I don't think
that's the answer.

   Oh, man, he don't like women!
   I told you this dude was--

     hey, hey!
     I do like women, all right?
     How are you?

      <i> Look, fellas, I'm sorry,</i>

     but there's no way she's
     gonna go out with me again.

     <i> Hmph. No way. I'll</i>
     <i> give you your money back.</i>

               You're damn right
               you will.

         <i> [ Eva ] 'cause I'm in</i>

    What, raymond? I am working.

   And you were right.

   I know you're upset with me,
   but I want you
   to go out with me again.

                And why is that?
   'Cause you're pretty.

                That's the most
                shallow thing
                I've ever heard.

   It's not like I got to really
   know you. So basically,
   I'm working on beauty here.

       Well, you know what? I am
       so much more than what's
       on the outside, okay?

          More than what appeals
          to some... Meat man.

   [ Chuckles ]
             And thank you
             for the compliment.

   I feel like I owe you.
   We can do anything you want.

           Yeah.
           [ Chuckles ]

    I have a confession to make.
    I used you.

       I can't afford to
       come here all the time.

       <i> I come but once a month</i>
       <i> when I save my pennies.</i>

 When you asked to go out again,
 I didn't really want to, but...

           I thought, you know--

       I guess that makes me
       a bad person, right?

   No. I just wanted to make up
   for the other night.

     Did you know I wanted to be
     a horse trainer when
     I was a little girl?

   No. But I could have guessed.

   <i> What happened?</i>

  I had to take care of my
  sisters, and a beginning horse
  trainer doesn't pay big bucks,

   so I took a job with the city
   and another as a waitress.

       And there you go.
       Steady pay checks.

 So why didn't you go back to it
 after your sisters were okay?

       You know what?
       Let's do something
       you want to do.

   Anything?

                     Yeah, sure.
   [ Whinnies ]

  I have to say, this is exactly
  how I thought you'd be living.

         What, you got something
         against pool?

   No, but a sofa wouldn't
   kill you, would it?

               Uh-uh.

           Your turn.

   So how does
   a meat delivery man...

  Afford a nice place like this?

   He struggles and makes do.

       Did I tell you
       my boss and I are going
       to the mayor's mansion...

   So we can show him cuts for
   a private dinner he's having?

   You're doing a meat show
   for the mayor?

     Meat presentation.
     There's a subtle difference
     of humiliation.

       So you never did
       answer my QUESTION:

 Why you didn't go
 back into horse training after
 your sisters got on their feet?

       I don't want to talk
       about it, okay?

   It's hard to get
   to know someone when
   they won't talk to you.

          You know, we're having
          a really good time
          right now, raymond.

     <i> Let's just drop it, okay?</i>

           Did you know...

 That I was an orphan
 just like you and your sisters?

My mom gave me up after
I was born. I don't think
she even knew who my father was.

   Yeah, so that explains it,

why the idea of staying
in one place scares you so much.

      Scares me? I said
      I was a multi-talented guy
      that liked to travel.

   - I didn't say I was scared.
   - I read about it.

   When a child is abandoned,

   he becomes afraid
   that his entire life
   will fall apart again.

   I don't think
   you should feel bad about it.

       It's a completely
       natural reaction.

               Okay then.

                I won't feel bad
                about it.

               What about you?
               [ Clears throat ]
   [ Scoffs ]

                         <i> Okay.</i>

Our parents died
in a car accident when I was 18.

 <i> Insurance paid for the house,</i>

 <i> and we started a bank account</i>
 <i> that we called</i>
 <i> the dandridge fund.</i>

     I guess as they grew older,

       I settled into this cushy
       little life I have now.

      And I didn't wanna go back
      and chase dreams of
      becoming a horse trainer.

   So I guess if it doesn't
   kill you, it makes
   you stronger, huh?

        I think what people mean
        when they say that...

 Is that you deal with
 whatever pain that you have
 by building a bridge over it...

   With all the things that life
   hasn't taken away from you.

   So if it doesn't kill you,
   it makes you build a bridge.

        Yeah. Yeah. That's good.
        I like that.
        I'm gonna use that.

   You should be proud
   of yourself.

                  No. I'm proud
                  of my sisters.

   What about you, eva?
   I know all that
   devotion cost you.

               It did.

             There was this guy,
             lucius johnson.
   Lucius.

       Anyway, he was
       our local Mr. Everything.

       You know. We were young,
       but it was serious.

  We were gonna get married,
  and ready for the world
  was gonna sing at our wedding.

    But... He asked me to choose
    between him and my sisters.

   And when I didn't choose him,
   he dumped me.
   Why didn't you choose him?

Because my sisters
needed me more than he did,
and what I needed didn't matter.

    So, what about you, raymond?
    What has the tragedy
    in your life given you?

       <i> [ Knocking ]</i>

       <i> [ Mike ] you know!</i>

   Just cough up the damn money
   so I can get goin'.

         Uh, okay. I didn't mean
         to interrupt.

   - yeah, you never do, mike.
   - pay you on the bet
   later, mike.

                No problem, ray.

          <i> It's all good, baby.</i>

   Mike's a lucky pool player.
                      That I am.

     Look, I'm gonna let you two
     get back to your date.

   See you later.

   <i> [ Mike shouts joyously ]</i>

          You know, mike
          and his little buddies
          are not fooling me.

   I didn't think so.
             No. They set us up,
             you and me.

            They want us to date
            so I'll stay out
            of their hair.

     You might not believe this.
     They don't really
     like me very much.

   I didn't get that.
                         Really?

   So, uh, do you mind that
   they set you up with me?

   Just show me how to
   hit the ball straight.

   You want me to show you
   how to hit the ball straight?
   Yeah.

             First, hold
             the stick straight.

           That's it.
           Now slide the stick
           between your fingers.

           [ Gasps ]

     Eva never misses our night.

                  Something must
                  have happened.

   - maybe she had an accident.
   - oh, please. Eva would call
   from the ambulance.

       - eva's with ray.
       - what?

           But... She hates him.
           We all agreed.

       - how do you know that?
       - she called me on her
       cell phone to say that...

       She and ray were going
       horseback riding.

       - I guess it went well.
       - horses? Three WORDS:

           <i> That's right.</i>
 No, no. We're just hanging out.

-He's modest.
-Now you have to tell her you're
moving to another state...

       So she can get out
       of our lives forever.

   <i> Yeah. Tell her you're going</i>
   <i> to somewhere like Delaware.</i>

     Can't nobody find that shit
     on the map. I know I can't.

       - do you have to be
       so gleeful about it?
       - what did he say?

                <i> Hey, ray, ray,</i>
                <i> ray, ray, ray.</i>

 - you gotta be tough. You gotta
 stay strong for all of us.
 - yeah.

      Men who get away with shit
      are the backbones
      of this here country, ray.

  <i> Yeah, life, liberty and</i>
  <i> getting away with shit, ray.</i>

   Did you know
   that eva does charity work,
   teaches bible studies?

   <i> She loves animals.</i>
   <i> She rides this horse</i>
   <i> named romeo.</i>

       He reacts to her
       like he understands.

       We didn't say she was
       a bad person. We said she
       was an irritating person.

      Yeah, and that horse
      is probably retarded, man.

       - I'm just saying--
       - just saying what, ray?

           <i> We had a deal, ray.</i>

       -<i> Remember your motto?</i>
       <i> Player first--</i>
       - [ All ] women second.

       -<i> Now, are you the man</i>
       <i> or what, ray?</i>
       - come on, ray.

   You're not hearing me.
   Are you the man or what, ray?

       - you know I'm your man.
       - yeah! All right!

                That's a player.
   I wasn't worried.

         That's my money working
         right there.

           â™ª [ Slow Jazz ]

            Eva, you
            flying solo tonight?

   Yeah, my boyfriend ray
   had some kind of
   inventory thing tonight, so--

        so you given any thought
        to the offer?

       I'm still thinking
       about it, sir.

          Don't let me rush you,
          eva. We do have
          a small window here.

 I'll keep that in mind. Thanks.

           Excuse me.

                       Hi.

   Um, let me get a white wine
   spritzer, please.

   You got it.

             Eva. Eva dandridge?

   - lucius?
   - I thought that was you.
   How you been?

   I'm fine, lucius.
   It's nice to see you again.

    I want you to meet somebody.

              My wife, renee.
              Baby, this is eva.

   -<i> The one I told you about.</i>
   - oh, the love of his life.

 <i> I've heard so much about you.</i>
 <i> I hate you.</i>

  <i> Yeah, eva and I were engaged</i>
  <i> after high school,</i>
  <i> but it didn't work out.</i>

  - you dumped me, lucius.
  - right. Didn't you have to go
  work for your baby sisters?

      <i> [ Renee ] eva, you broke</i>
      <i> lucius's heart.</i>

   Thank god you did though.
   Or else I never
   would have got him.

   These are our kids.

       They're cute. Real cute.

 I'm assistant to the mayor now.
 Hired me right out
 of general motors.

    <i> [ Renee ]</i>
    <i> At a very generous salary.</i>

   - so, eva,
   what is it that you do?
   - I'm a health inspector.

         Great. So you go look
         at dirty kitchens
         and public restrooms...

          <i> And stuff like that?</i>

   - sounds fascinating, girl.
   - it pays the bills, yeah.

           So where's your date?

           <i> He's running late.</i>

   Sorry, baby.
   I had that thing.

   You okay?
                   Yeah.

   Hi. Ray adams.

 How you doing, man?
 Lucius johnson. My wife, renee.
           Hello.

   Lucius.
   Heard a lot about you.

       - so how long you two
       been going out?
       - not long.

   I was in africa on business.
   The city is trading
   with the brothers over there.

   I came all the way back
   to escort eva.

<i> I had no idea the city</i>
<i> of Los Angeles</i>
<i> was a trade partner in africa.</i>

   You wouldn't.
   It's on the highest levels
   of city government.

        Really? Well, let's hear
        all about this
        so-called trade program.

              Ray, shush.
              It's fun time now.
   Mr. Mayor!

                            Hey.

        Ray, how is my main man?
   Good, sir. Good, good.

   Good to see you.
   This is my date, eva.

           So this is eva.

               Ray, you didn't
               do her justice.

                 Thank you, sir.

       - and this is, uh,
       lumpy and reeses.
       - lucius and renee, sir.

  I'm one of your new assistants
  and I thought that--
                   ray.

       I want you to bring
       this beautiful young lady
       up to the house sometime.

   Will do, sir.
              Great to meet you.

           Nice to meet you too.
   Thank you, sir. Thank you.

   Ray, my man.
   I'm sorry about that--

       you can have a rain check
       on kissing my ass, leo.

        I have to dance with
        the prettiest girl here.

   Right.
   Good seeing you again, eva.

   If you don't stop
   staring at her,

   I'm gonna slap the taste
   out of your mouth.

       Was that okay?
              The question is,
              how did you do it?

          Well, first I got home
          from work early,

 then I watched you
 from across the room
 looking like you wanted to die.

                Okay. And what
                about the mayor?

 I did a hell of a meat
 presentation for him. Remember?
                   That's right.

   He's a really nice guy.
   I only had to beg him once.

   You know you look good
   in that tux, right?

           Your hair looks fine.

   Thank you. Bethany did it.
                         Really?

   I should go by there one day.
   No. Promise me
   you will not go in there.

                   Okay. Okay.

 You know, you're a good dancer.

       You know. Body movement's
       my specialty.
   [ Gasps ]

               Smooth.

   You know, they once banned
   dipping in some countries...

   Because it was considered
   a form of foreplay.

             I didn't know that.

           [ Chuckles ]
           Okay.

   You learn something new
   every day, huh?
                           Yeah.

                How long do you
                wanna stay here?

   After watching lucius grovel,

           not long.

              What you wanna do?

   Something fun.

   <i> [ Eva pants ] nice sofa.</i>

       I bought it just for you.

   Just a second.
   Let me get this off.

             No, eva. Don't take
             your clothes off.

   You wanna do it with them on?
   I'm into that.
   Let me hike this up.

   No. No, no, no, no.
   I can't do this.

      The bulge in your pants
      didn't get that memo, so--

   no, no, no, no. I-- I need
   to tell you something.

            Yes. Whatever it is,
            yes. Yes.
   No, look.

   I don't wanna move too fast.

     Fast? No. The average
     american couple has sex
     on their third date, and...

      We have been dating way,
      way, way longer than that.

   I just--

   look, you've been through
   so much stuff with men.

   And I don't wanna
   mess things up.
   I want it to be perfect.

   I just think
   we should wait a while.

         I have to respect that,
         don't I?

   Yeah, I guess you do.

           I have to go.

   Please, don't be mad at me.
        No, I'm not. It's just--

I just never had a guy who cared
so much about my feelings.
It's kind of--

             ooh. It's making me
             want you even more.

            And if I don't leave
            right now,

        I'm gonna start saying
        all kinds of hot, nasty,
        dirty things.

       How hot and nasty?
               Real freaky.

   Go. Go.
                  Oh, god. Okay.

   Stay.
               Yeah? Oh, god.

   No.
                   Okay.

               Look--

                  <i> [ Knocking ]</i>

               Yes!

           Oh, my god.

       Did I hurt you?
                            Yes.

               But I liked it.
           Yeah?

             Maybe next time
             we'll actually
             make it to the bed.

       Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

           That was good.

               Ray,

   I wanted to say,
   the stuff I said before,
   I just wanted to apologize.

   I mean, how I acted.

            That was
            a beautiful apology.

          The best part was when
          you called me ray.

   That's 'cause there's not
   a lot of need to be
   formal right about now.

   'Cause I'm a big ho.
                    [ Chuckles ]

       If you really wanna
       make it up to me,
       tell me a joke.

 No. I'm not a good joke teller.
 I'm terrible.
That's what makes it so special.

   Okay. Oh, god.
   Okay. Okay. Okay.

   Okay. Okay.

  This guy goes to a zoo, right?

   You're gonna like it.
   Okay, he goes to a zoo.

   And he sees this gorilla.
                       Okay.

   Okay. And he says
   to the gorilla,
   "yo, brother. Can you give--"

   No. He says,
   "yo, brother. Can you loan--"

   Yeah. "Yo, brother.
   Can you loan me a dollar?"

And the gorilla says,
"that's why I don't wear pants."

                          Right.
           Oh, my god.

   Don't you get it?
   The pants and the gorilla.

                 Yeah. Best joke
                 I ever heard.

         Best joke I ever heard.
   I forgot about that joke.

           Oh, my god.
                Oh, my goodness.

                   <i> Ray?</i>
               Hmm?

 Thinking about what you told me
 about your parents.

     God, I mean, my folks died,
     but I had my sisters
     to live for, you know?

   I just think it might be--

 it might be easier
 for you to get over
 your fear of building a life...

   If you had someone there
   to help you do it.

               I see.

   You wanna be my bridge.

     It's not like I wanna get
     married to you or anything.
   [ Clears throat ]

       I can-- I can be a really
       good friend, that's all.

 You give me your body, and then
 you offer me your friendship?

     My priorities are straight.
     Thank you very much.

       I'm offering you
       the best of me right now.
       [ Scoffs ]

   Eva.
               Hmm?

   I'm not the person
   you think I am.

   I know most women think
   their man is the one
   that's different.

   None of us are different.

   I'm just like other men.

   Maybe not as good as most.

   I want you to think about
   what it would take to build
   a bridge with me.

     I can handle it, ray. Okay?
     I can handle it.

          As long as you keep
          giving me what I need,
          I am good.

   Is that all you want?
               Yeah.

       That. That.
       A whole lot of that.

   A lot of that?
           A lot of that.

    And all the other stuff too.

           You hear me?

       How can I turn down
       a deal like that?

           You can't.

               Can you?

           What's up?

          Hey, girl. Nice shoes.

         Ormandy. You look good.

              Telly, baby,
              give me some love.
              [ Grunting ]

                Eva, what has
                gotten into you?

  - [ Telly ] not "what," "who."
  - what are you wearing?

 - eva, you're glowing.
 -<i> [ bethany ] what did you do?</i>

   Shit, I ain't sharing
   my "bidness" with you.

 -<i> Oh, my god. She said "shit."</i>
 - and "bidness."

  - she gone mad to her ass.
  - y'all need to stop trippin'.
  I'm just in a good mood.

  It's a beautiful day out.
  I'm with my girls. Stop
  sweatin' me. My joints is hot.

       And my cakes is moist.

   Can a sister get some water
   or a fan or iceberg
   or something?

 - okay, eva, for real.
 You're scaring me.
 - did you and ray do it or not?

               Well,

   he did show up
   at the mayor's fund-raiser.

       Just when I was trapped
       by lucius johnson...
           [ All gasp ]

           And his wife.

       - you saw lucius?
       What did you do?
       - nothing. Ray did it.

   He put that little sucker
   in his place.

        Excuse me. Is there
        like some, um, boning...

        Or salad tossing or
        something in this story?
   Stop it.

                   Come on.
   Okay. After he rescued me,

   we danced all night long.

   Slow, close,

   just pelvis to pelvis.
                       Mm-hmm.

       And then we went back
       to my place...

       And had a nice
       respectable evening.

           [ All groaning ]

       And then we burned
       a hole in the floor!

   You better
   work it, honey!

   <i> [ Darrell ]</i>
   <i> Wow. There's my baby.</i>
   <i> Let's get freaky-deaky.</i>

        Come on. To the bedroom.
        Follow me.

   You know what eva told me?
       Here we go.

     She told me that ray
     drives his old van
     from his job to save money.

   So what? I mean, what's that
   got to do with freaky-deaky?

      I don't feel like
      I sacrifice like ray does.

          You know, when I need
          to get back into being
          focused on school.

   Look. First off, ray and eva,
   they ain't you and me.

               I know that.
   They're not married.

   They ain't phone-boning.
   They're not having sex.
   None of that.

     Actually, they do have sex.

   He hit that?
                   Mm-hmm.

           And from what I hear,

    you could take
    a little lesson
    from him in that department.

   What the--

   what's that supposed to mean?
   He got some tricks and shit?

   I seen the dude
   lickin' his lips and stuff.

              Come on, sexy.
              Let's play doctor.
   Tim, listen to me, all right?

      I have been thinking a lot
      about ray and eva...

        And how they have
        this wonderful
        new relationship, right?

   And it's made me think
   about myself and the plan
   that I had for my life...

   And how I let it go.

     What? But, baby,
     I threw all my condoms out.

       Honey.
                   Ohh.

   I'll get you some more.
   They're on sale at target.

              Come on, kareenah!
              Sweetie, listen.

    I am ready. Baby, I am
    so damn fertile that if you
    kiss me you'll get pregnant.

  This isn't like buying a coat.
  If you have a baby,

   you can't give it back
   if you don't want it.

      Who said that, ray or eva?
   I don't remember.

               [ Groans ]

   Honey, why is my potpourri
   on the bed?

                   See--
   get the dustbuster.

          It was-- I was gonna--
           <i> tired.</i>

    <i> Baby, I thought we've</i>
    <i> been through this already.</i>

   Ray and eva have
   a good relationship
   and they don't cohabitate.

   Oh, my god. That's all
   I've been hearing lately.
   Ray and eva. Ray and eva.

   It's not like they're will
   and jada or george and weezy.

 They each have their own place.
 They have respect
 for each other.

       Ray doesn't even
       care about eva. I paid--

  I paid close attention to him.
  He does not like her.

   Sure. That's why ray
   calls her every day.

   That's why they have lunch
   together three times a week.

 That's why eva's thinking about
 passing on a new job to stay.
       What job?

   Eva was offered
   a new job in Chicago.

   But she's gonna say no
   because she found ray.

       - ain't that a--
       - but here's something
       that'll make you happy.

       - we're dissolving
       the dandridge fund.
       - really? That's great.

   - eva's gonna keep it all.
   - what?

   You know. She has a new life,
   a new man. She's gonna need
   that money. Okay, baby.

         Here's all your stuff.
         Let yourself out, okay?
         Love you.

   I can't run from myself.

   It's like someone gave me
   a pair of glasses...

   That filter out
   all the foolishness
   and stupidity in my life.

   What have I given you
   for that gift, eva?

   Nothing.

    You taught me how to
    trust again, ray. I wouldn't
    call that nothing.

           [ Scoffs ]

       And you've helped me come
       to a decision of my own.

               What?

        Baby,
        if you're gonna be here,

            then this is exactly
            where I wanna be.

      Crossed the line with eva,
      didn't you, ray?
   No.

   Don't lie, you lyin'
   bald-headed son of a bitch.

              All I did was what
              you paid me for.

       And now that eva's
       in a relationship,
       our women are even worse.

          Everything that you do
          comes back on us.

   And eva's keeping
   all the money, ray.

            That's not my fault.
       Like hell it ain't
       your fault, ray!

Something's wrong with you, ray.
You've been having
too much damn fun with eva.

    You haven't asked for any
    expenses lately. Why's that?

   You pay for the woman.
   You must like the woman.

   That's ridiculous.
   I'm a player. I'm on the job.
 What's in the garment bag, ray?

   Nothing. A suit.
   I got a promotion at work.

        A promotion?
        That is eva all the way.
   No, that's me.

     Then what the hell is this?
     Tupperware.

                    That's eva's
                    middle name.

       I just needed
       to organize a few things.

   Organization is eva's
   second middle name.

       Look, eva got a job offer
       in Chicago.

     You're gonna dump her.
     That way, she has no reason
     to stay here, get it?

           Yes. Say "yes," ray.
   She's staying because of me?

   Uh-uh. She's staying
   because you boned her.
       You boned her!

  We know all about it, partner.
         And that is like
         stealing from your job.

              You have embezzled
              the booty.
                   Now, look.

      You're gonna call her
      tomorrow, and you're gonna
      tell her it's over.

   No.
               He did not just
               say "no," did he?

       - no, I said "no."
       - listen, now!
       Hold up for a second!

           You're supposed to be
           a master player.
           You forgot the rules.

    Players don't feel.
    That's like a pimp
    with a health plan, brother.

        Mike, where did you find
        this big-ass bamba, man?

   You done went from dmx
   to babyface on us, man.
   What's up with that?

     Wait. They done gave you
     a copy of their theme song.

              They done made you
              a orange.
   Okay, okay, look.

       I'm sorry. I do like her,
       all right?

   I had to open my heart
   to get to her, and when
   I did, she got to me first.

     - I think I might love her.
     - [ All ] love?

   Love is an excuse, an alibi,
   a justification for sex.

  But it is not something
  that should stop a man
  from keeping his promise, ray.

        Look. I'm sorry, fellas.

             I'm going
             to see eva tonight,

          and the least I can do
          is tell her in person
          what I did.

                So... That's it.

                   Mike?

       Come on. Let's go.

                     Mike. Mike!

      So, is she real good, man?
      Does she have some
      methods that she did?

               'Cause I'm trying
               to get jacqui--

   ha!

       [ Indistinct chattering ]

           This is bull--

                     No problem.

    so y'all can get back

   -<i> 'Cause I need a real man.</i>
   - here we go.

           I need a real man,
           not a child or a boy.

   Give me a hard rock,
   not a soft little toy.
                           Well!

<i> You think women are hard?</i>
<i> You think we're evil and mean?</i>

  - well, I think maybe
  you don't need us.
  - maybe you on the wrong team.

       [ Women laughing ]

      So I need a real man,
      and my standards are high.

             Mike. Honey,
             is something wrong?
   I got some bad news.

    <i> It's, uh-- it's about ray.</i>

   Ray!
               My ray?

       What-- is he okay?

<i> [ Ray narrating ]</i>
<i> Some story, huh?</i>
<i> Well, it's not quite complete.</i>

   <i> We got three hours before</i>
   <i> the funeral, fellas. Is all</i>
   <i> the food and water okay?</i>

       Everything is okay.
       Darrell, where did
       you find this place?

    This is an old
    postal storage warehouse,
    but we don't use it anymore,

           not till now.
           [ Chuckles ]

  <i> Look here, ray,</i>
  <i> you got everything you need.</i>
  <i> You even have two bathrooms.</i>

       Bucket number one,
       and bucket number two.

       You'll be a little gamey
       in a few days,
       but you'll be alive.

       <i> This won't work.</i>
   Oh, yes, it will,
   baby muscles.

See, you've died
in a car accident,
according to this police report.

   Show him. Right here.
                   Yeah, yeah.

       Eva needed to know
       that your body was
       immediately cremated.

       What about my family?
       Did you think about that,
       smart guys?

You ain't got no relatives, ray,
and very little friends,
thanks to your job-hopping.

   <i> And eva took that job</i>
   <i> in chi-town after she</i>
   <i> found out you were dead.</i>

  It's not fair for you
  to make her leave under a lie.

   It wasn't fair for you
   to screw us on that deal.
   [ Shouting ]

   No, ray. Let him go.
   Let him go!

         Come on. Fellas,
         fellas, fellas, listen.

    <i> Listen. Maybe we need</i>
    <i> to just think about this</i>
    <i> for one minute, all right?</i>

   No, you think about this.
   It's our word against his.

       <i> By the time</i>
       <i> he tells eva the truth,</i>
       <i> she'll be long gone.</i>

And then we can say we didn't
know anything about this
sick joke that he played on her.

   What the hell are you doing
   falling in love with eva?

<i> I think it's 'cause she got</i>
<i> some good booty, man. See all</i>
<i> that aggression he got in him?</i>

       That's 'cause
       he ain't gettin' none.
   Let's go.

       The booty's good.

       <i> Come on, tim.</i>

           Tim, come on!

  <i> First of all,</i>
  <i> I'd like to thank all of you</i>
  <i> for coming today.</i>

   You know, ray and I
   didn't really know
   each other very long,

   <i> but... In that short amount</i>
   <i> of time,</i>

   <i> we became really close.</i>

   <i> You know, when someone</i>
   <i> enters your life, you--</i>

       you don't really know
       how it changes you...

       Until they're gone.

              I thought you said
              this was gonna be
              a simple funeral.

               Who are
               all these people?

   Eva. She invited
   all her friends from work.

       Where the hell does
       eva work at,<i> soul train?</i>

       Look at all these
       black people in here.
       It's packed.

  Look, just hang in there.
  It's gonna be okay. I promise.

         <i> Eva, we did take ray.</i>

   And we lied about him
   being dead.

        This is the best funeral
        I've ever been to
        in my life.

   Ooh, you got
   that right. Huh.

   I'm sorry.

           It's not their fault.

   You three...

   Have yet to feel my rage.

    <i> Eva, you don't understand.</i>

           It was because of me.

          The only reason
          I went out with you...

     Is because they paid me to.

                       [ Sighs ]

            I was supposed to...
            Make you like me...

     But I didn't know you then.

         I didn't realize
         how wonderful you are--

      how much you've changed me
      and make me wanna change.

             I know
             I was wrong, but...

What we have is bigger
than all the mistakes I've made.

            I'm certain of that.

   How much did they pay you?

               Eva, that's not--
       how much?

          Five thousand dollars.

       But, eva, I'm giving them

   You know what I learned
   about love, raymond?

   It isn't a virus
   that infects you.
   It's a choice.

   We choose to be in love,
   and we choose
   what love makes us do.

   I earned your choice,
   and you stole mine.

   my entire life for you,

   and all you were
   ready to do was let me.

   So are you sure?

   Are you sure you love me?

   Or are you just upset that...

   I found out
   what you were and...

   Made a different choice?

 That's what I thought.
 Excuse me. I have travel plans.

       What's up, fellas?

           Eva, you don't
           have to rub it in.

<i> We've been trying to apologize</i>

          Hello. Is linda there?

               Hey, babe.

       Listen, I'll pick you up
       over on fairfax.

           I'm at work.

 No, you know you can't come by.

       I'm pretending to be gay.

   Because in LA.,
   a straight hairdresser
   is an unemployed hairdresser.

   Well, at least
   until I get my own place.

       Absolutely.
       Okay, I love you too.

      Telly, honey.
      Would it kill you to come
      in there and do some work?

Oh, I'm sorry.
I just had to check on my honey.
You know how they are.
