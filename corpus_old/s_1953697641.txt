What?

l can't hear you.

Tell me there's no range
in this fucking place.

Yeah, great.

l really need it some way.

Listen, Mike.

l'm stopping in a city
five minutes from here

so l can try and call you
back from a fixed phone line.

Jack Stone.

35 years old.

Four of which
spent in lraq.

Medal of the Congress.

An expert in
high-risk missions.

A capable man in
every aspect.

So tell me, General.

What on earth
makes you think this

capable man will accept
a mission like this?

ln exchange
for his freedom.

Stone is currently detained
in a six-by-nine-foot cell

where he's
serving a life sentence.

What could a man
in his position

desire more
than his freedom?

And what's he been
charged with?

Treason and murder,
Mr. Secretary,

but l'll spare
you the details.

A widower with a
seven-year-old daughter

he hasn't seen
since he was detained.

Still...

a capable man with
great strategic skills

a natural leader.

But as l said...
a Mr. Nobody

with no one
left waiting for him.

No one apart
from his daughter.

Why do you think he
accepted the mission, sir?

So you're absolutely sure

that Stone will carry out
this mission

without
suspecting anything?

Absolutely.

l will personally
travel to Romania

and follow the situation closely.

The Romanian government
has already been informed.

Everything will proceed
as planned.

Rojznov is...

nothing more than
a small dormitory town,

with the power plant workers

and theirfamilies
in the middle of nowhere.

The explosion will erase any trace
of the laboratory

in the building.

But how can we be sure

that Stone can carry out
this mission on his own?

Well, that's simple.

Because he won't be
on his own.

John ''Mad Dog'' McKellen...

AKA, The Specialist,

expert in
explosives and firearms.

He could build
a lethal weapon

just with a glass
and a pencil sharpener.

To Mr. McKellen, we owe
the explosion

of the Congress Palace
of Johannesburg in 1997.

More than 50 people died
in the bombing.

Dragan llic...

the sniper.

They say during
the Kosovo War,

Mr. llic killed
more than 300 people

without ever leaving his position, ever.

He could shoot a mouse dead
from over a mile away.

Eden Shizuka.

Unbeatable in
hand-to-hand combat.

Now, she will be
indispensible

should our men find themself

in a difficult situation
and low on ammo.

She learned how
to fight from some

scatter brained
monk in Japan

where she'd moved from
Northern lreland

with her mother--
but that's not important.

So l guess
you're gonna tell me that

they all have a daughter

waiting for them at home.
No.

l will tell you,

they will each have
$2 million

waiting in
their bank accounts.

They are soldiers of fortune,
Mr. Secretary.

Mercenaries.

They would do
anything for money.

So the money we offer them

will help keeping
their mouth shut.

At least until they
have left for the mission.

How can we be sure that
there will be no survivors?

There could be a family somewhere

hidden away,
waiting to be rescued.

With all due respect, sir,

l would be more worried
should someone divulge

what we did to that city.

Theoretically, we should not
have been active

in that part of Europe.

l urge you to bear in mind
we are very short on time.

We would not be
able to sustain

a possible
virus propagation.

Those... monsters

could eventually
find a way to escape

the security perimeter,

and we don't have a cure.

Not since our dear
Doc Neumann passed away.

And there's no trace
of his daughter.

Oh, yes, we
we did search for her,

but, well, the situation
was already critical.

But should we find
that she is still alive,

then we will bring her in.

You can be
sure of that.

Now is the time to act.

The ground water
tables have been sealed

and the toxicity of the cloud
has vanished.

Rojznov has now
been quarantined.

But those things are infected.

One would be
enough to infect

the whole country in
a matter of hours,

and in a few days,
the world!

May God forgive us all.

Look at them run.

Just like chickens.

Uh-huh.

Why run when,
just around the corner,

someone is about to blow up
a nuclear power plant

to exterminate the whole or
whatever them things are?

ln fact, they're like
a bunch of rabid dogs.

Do you know what, Dragan?
Eh?

This is turning out not to
be a picnic in the park.

You're getting soft,
my friend.

Remember Laos?

lt's never gonna be
worse than that.

Aye, l remember.

But every time we seem to get
ourselves in bigger shit.

C'est la vie,
mon ami.

Just think
about big bucks.

That should set up your
mind with ease.

All soldiers
get ready for evacuation.

Aye, l'll think about it.

You know what?
What?

This is my last gig.

Let's just blow up
these shitheads,

level this place.

And then l can
get my ass

in a first-class seat...

all the way to
the mountains.

l'm gonna open a restaurant
on the beach.

You?

l cannot picture you
wearing a bermuda,

some flowery
Hawaiian shirt.

But you do like my haggis
and leeks, don't you?

Hell no.

The only thing
your slop is good

is for maneuvering
the fields.

Seriously.

l'm no longer
subject for your

exotic culinary
experiments.

They always ended up
in a hurricane of shit.

Do you know what?

lt's always with
a skinny-ass like you,

as you didn't like eating.

l'm so sorry to spoil
your self-glorification,

but l love eating,

as much as l care
what happens after.

l don't like when
your ''cookings''

get from
my mouth to my guts.

lt's some nasty shit,
believe me.

You don't want to know.

All personnel
prepare for evacuation.

You're right.

You're full of shit.

Do you know
there's a saying?

No.

lf you do not like eating,

then you probably
don't like fucking, either.

Your mother
never complained.

And l'm pretty sure
it was something like,

if you can't cook...

you can't fuck.

Well, my friend...

l can cook.

Yup.

And l can
lick my own balls.

Really?

What do you say,
princess?

Do you like cooking?

l'd love to see you
in the kitchen,

jumping
from pot to pan,

with nothing on...

but a teeny-weeny apron.

Save a bullet, will you?

Give up, my friend.

Women are never very
talkative people like us.

Deep down, they know we can
show them paradise

beneath the sheets,

and they feel it
in their guts.

Give up?

Me?

Are you kidding?

Right.

What do you say,
princess?

How about you and me

get something on
together...

between the sheets?

All soldiers get ready
for evacuation.

Who the hell is this guy?

Good flight, Lieutenant?

Let's not waste
any more time.

We let you in
from here.

You'll be escorted up to

the security
containment perimeter.

Once inside, you're on
your own.

Just the way l like it.

The bomb will be
primed by our engineers.

You will need to get as close
as possible to the reactor

and get there
as quickly as you can.

Why don't we
go in through there?

lt looks a damn sight
easier to me.

lt's too risky.

That's the most
populated area,

hence the more likely to be polluted
with the infected.

lt gets better and better.

Obviously,
the area you'll pass through

should be considered safer,
but not safe,

so watch your backs.

Be on alert
at all times.

You'll take this
side street,

which leads directly to
the nuclear power plant.

Should everything go as planned
once the bomb is placed,

you'll have about an
hour to get back to this base.

One hour?

Bloody hell.

And what happens
if you're late?

The school bus will
come and collect us?

Here, you will find a helicopter
waiting to take you to

a safe military depot.

There you will be
held until the dust

from the explosion
is settled.

Only at that point...

will the mission be classed
as accomplished.

The answer to your
question, Mr. llic...

if you are late...

you die.

Considering the sum
we're paying you,

a delay
cannot be accepted.

Oh, talking about money.

As we agreed,
one million now,

the rest once the mission
is accomplished.

Any questions?

Very well.

Mr. Stone, if you please.

l hope at least
you care about

this mission, Lieutenant.

Should the virus propagate,
it would be the end.

You must move quickly,

place the bomb
and get out.

lt must be made to look
like a terrible accident.

The power plant explodes,

the Rojznov
inhabitants die.

Their country mourns
their loss

and the United States
share in their sorrow.

Nobody will know
any different.

This is your mission.

l'm sure you fully
comprehend the situation.

l'm not here to comprehend
anything, General.

l'm here
for my daughter.

Of course.

You have my word,

you will
hug your daughter

once the mission is accomplished.

The case will be closed,
all files will be lost.

You'll have
a new beginning, Jack.

Don't try to pull
any smart moves.

We will be watching your
every step via satellite.

Accomplish the mission

and you'll be a free man.

This doesn't look good.

What did you expect?

Balloons and bouquets?

Abandon all hope...

ye who enters here.

l still don't understand

what l'm supposed
to be shooting.

Are they
people or what?

Oh... come on, Dragan.

Does it make
a difference anyway?

Don't tell me you've...

developed a conscience
since we last worked together.

Just trying to make conversation,

considering our
chief, and this one here,

talking is going to be

the hardest part
of the mission.

You talk enough
for everyone, Dragan.

Say that again?

lf everything goes
according to plan,

we won't have to
shoot anybody.

We go in, we drop the bomb,

we get out
and forget about this place.

What a bummer.

Eh, Dragan?

l bet you were
looking forward

to blowing the heads off
some poor, innocent

women and children,

like you guys do...

in that shitty country
of yours.

Right?

Why don't you go
and fuck yourself

with a Viking helmet?

So what brings
you here, chief?

No offense.

But you do not
look like one of us.

You look more like...

one of those
Mr. Nice Guys

that helps little old ladies
across the street.

The only
difference is...

you got muscle.

lt has nothing
to do with money

if that's what you're asking,
soldier.

Come on, man.

We're all in
this shit together.

The least you can do

is tell us what brought you
into this fucking mess.

l was promised
a clear criminal record.

l bring home the mission...

and they cancel
my conviction.

Conviction for what?

Stealing a candy?

Leave him alone,
Dragan.

Come on, chief.

What did you do?

Everything is
allowed in war.

Well, almost.

Let's share
some secrets, huh?

Want to know what was
the worst thing

l did during a mission?

Will you shut
your big mouth?

All right.

Have a go.

l jerked off on a goat.

Jesus fucking Christ,
Dragan.

Do not swear.

There's something wrong.

You can hear
a pin drop.

McKellen,
open the gate.

And you two stay on board.

Hey, what the hell
he's doing?

The first lesson
of the perfect bomber:

always save the explosion
'til the very last.

Come on, man,
where is the fun?

Would you cut
the bullshit?

We're sitting on
a prime nuclear weapon.

lt's best we get
going, then.

Carter, you remember me?

l'm the president
of the United States.

I'm on my farm here in Texas

and instead of playing golf
or whatever,

fucking some hookers,

uh, l think about you,
and not in a good way.

l hope everything is okay.

Yes, Mr. President.

Everything is
going as planned.

Any press around,
whatever,

l don't want another
CNN feature about me.

And, Carter, don't
fuck it up again,

as in Korea and Vietnam,

almost in
the Second World War.

You remember your father
almost lost the whole war.

No, sir.

There won't be
any problems.

l assure you.

Everything
will go as planned.

Okay, go back to your work,
just forget it.

And maybe l just
push the red button

and blow it all up.

Bye.

Dragan, get to position

and keep your eye
on everything.

Don't shoot unless
absolutely necessary,

and please...

don't fuck it up.

No worry, chief.

This what
l do for a living.

And what might
that be?

Fucking things up?

McKellen, you take
care of the bomb.

Eden and l will
patrol the area

to make sure there's
no surprises.

Come on.

Let's get out of here ASAP.

Just give me
five more minutes, chief,

and we'll be strolling away
from this shithouse.

Happy as
a pig in shit.

And rich.

And filthy rich!

What the fuck?

Oh, shit.

Shit.

Shit!

Chief!

John?

l don't believe it.

l'm gonna kill that
son of a bitch.

You want to tell me what
the fuck's going on?

We're screwed.

We are royally
screwed.

That's
what's going on.

Take a look at this.

Jesus.

Can't you do
anything about this?

Not only is it welded
to the chassis,

but the primer is
deep inside the engine

and that's linked direct
into the timer.

Any interference by me...

and l could slow,
if not stop the program.

Even to look at
this thing...

could cause a problem.

Hey!

What are you waiting?

Eden...
check the area.

John, if we
can't use this car,

then we need to
find a vehicle

in order to get out of here.

Let's check these warehouses
and see what we can find.

Let's get back to Carter
to show him in full detail

with whom he just
tried to fuck.

General, they're in.

Do they have the situation
under control?

Not exactly, sir.

Look.

Sir, l think we should
send a message--

Don't waste your
energy thinking, Private.

This mission is a success.

Those monsters will just
make things easier.

Pack everything up.

We're leaving.

Yes, sir.

Stone, McKellen...

20 incoming, 3:00!

Come on, come on...

Come on...

steady, chief.

There are more
of them coming.

How much ammo you got?

l got about 12 cartridges
for this piece of shit.

That's better than nothing.

Dragan!

Move it,
we're out of here.

Oh, shit, Jack.

Look!

What are you
looking at?

Come on.

Decide who's gonna put
a bullet in my head.

l'll do it myself.

l don't want to hurt
your chances of meeting...

my Lord.

Don't make me beg.

Do it now.

My brother.

So many wars.

So many women.

We will fight again.

We will fight...

Forgive me,
my brother.

Forgive me.

We will meet again.

John, let's move out.

John!

We're not gonna
die here today.

At least not
before Carter does.

lf we're gonna make it to base
before the bomb blows up,

we're gonna have to
go through the city.

We're gonna die
in that city, chief.

And we both know it.

We have to
get a vehicle.

lt's the only chance we've
got to get back

to the military base
and get the hell out of here

before the shit really
hits the fan.

Granted, that is if
we have a working helicopter

when we get there.

l seriously doubt Carter
hasn't thought about

every single
possible escape route.

Aye.

And l swear, if l come
across the son of a bitch,

he's gonna have a close
and deep encounter

with my knife.

Sir, you should see this.

You're a dreamer, Stone.

Sir?

What is it, Private?

We just received
a call from the runway.

There's a technical problem
with the blades of our helicopter.

The mechanic has
already left the base.

Damned idiots!

Sir, l alerted the pilot

and he's already
working on it.

He says he can fix it,
he just needs a little time.

Time?

That's exactly what we don't have,
you stupid fool.

Do you want us to end up
like those things out there?

No, sir,
but l thought

Then save your excuses

and get the helicopter
fixed,

unless you want to
face a court martial.

Yes, sir.

lt's a wee bit classy...

but l think it'll do.

Of course...

providing the owner's
all right with it.

Well, if that
guy's the owner,

l think he'll be just
fine about it.

Son of a...

Princess,
you do talk.

The wise only speak
when it's time to speak.

The fool never shuts his
goddamn sewage hole.

Oh, fuck you.

Do you know what?

My lips get
a little bit loose,

especially when
l'm nervous.

You must have a very bad case
of chronic nervousness.

All right, kids,
shut up and get in,

we're running
out of time.

l'll drive.

lf we just
get out of the city,

we might just have
a chance.

And how many of those
ugly bastards

do you think
there are out there

just waiting for us?

There's a lot more of those
than we have ammo for, John.

l like your optimism, chief.

They don't call me

Mr. Fucking Sunshine
for nothing.

These don't need ammo.

See?

No problem.

Jesus, chief.

This is getting serious.

Hey, Scotty.

A gift for you.

And what am l supposed
to do with this?

Luckiest son of a bitches
l've ever seen.

lt's no wonder
this government

wants to blow this
shithole up.

Going any further without
weapons or ammo is suicide.

Another run-in with a bunch
of those wild creatures

and we're
gonna be joining

their fucked-up family.

And where are we gonna
find any ammo around here?

l've got a funny feeling,
chief.

A local gun store,
if there ever was one,

is not gonna be
open today.

Bingo.

Okay, chief.

Watch where
you're driving.

Get inside!

Chief!

Who took the smile
off his face?

That's definitely
not a rat.

We've got you
covered, chief.

Go get the ammo.

Come on, baby.

Where have you been
all my life?

For fuck's sake!

Christ...

Die!

Who are you?

Open the cell
and l'll tell you.

l'm not gonna
ask you twice.

Then we're in a stall,
don't you think?

l'm not saying anything

unless you
free me first.

Listen, lady.

ln just a little while,

this place is gonna be
like the 4th of July

and that cell is gonna be

the last place you
wanna be.

So for the last time...

who are you?

You know what?

Fuck you!

You men are always
all and now, aren't you?

My name is
Samantha Neumann.

Doc Neumann's daughter?

Although l doubt you even
know who l'm talking about.

Dr. Herbert Neumann,
toxicologist, immunologist.

Surgeon leader for
Project ''K''

for the US Army.

Another brilliant mind

in the bacteriological
warfare.

My father
is not a murderer.

Really?

Jesus Christ.

Okay, are you
letting me out or not?

Hey!

Hey, where are
you going?

Asshole!

l knew it.

A "thank you"
would be nice.

Thank you.

Daddy.

Now if you'd be so kind
as to introduce yourself

and telling me what the hell
is going on here.

Whoa!

Nice catch, chief.

Hello?

ls anybody gonna bother explaining
to me what's up?

lt's a pretty straightforward
fucked-up situation, babe.

Either we get ourselves
300 miles away from here

or we're gonna look like

those people
from Hiroshima.

No offense.

We'll explain it
to you later.

Right now,
there's no time.

Let's move.

Not a good idea, chief.

Call the secretary, now!

Yes, sir,
right away, sir!

Ah, we're running
out of time, chief.

You're right.

Let's get busy.

Can you shoot?

l'm a fast learner.

What?

Come on.

Oh, fuck.

This is my
favorite gun.

Let's go.

Come on, princess.

Okay.

Pay attention.

Check the mag,
make sure you're loaded.

Click it back into place.

Check the barrel,
you got one loaded,

safety's off.

Point, you're ready to fire.

Don't hit
the convertible.

l'll be careful.

Why were you in there?

A brawl.

ln a bar.

You?

ln a brawl?

What's so funny?

Nothing, ljust can't see you
in a brawl or a bar.

Yeah, well, that's
'cause you don't know me.

l'm Jack Stone.

You're wounded.

Hang on.

Let me look at this.

Jack.

A regular name
for a regular guy.

You sure don't look like
a regular guy, though.

You don't look like
a regular girl.

l'll take that
as a compliment.

Would you mind telling me
what's going on, Jack?

Sure.

The government wants to
nuke this whole place.

So we brought in
an atomic bomb,

put it in
the nuclear power plant

and it's gonna go off in
about 30 minutes.

You what?

lt's the only way
they could be sure that

the virus wouldn't
propagate.

lt's not a virus.

Come again?
lt's not a virus.

lt's a cytotoxic toxin

secreted by
a "microbiotic" organism

synthesized in a lab.

My dad is the leader
of the operation.

His studies in immunology

had drawn
the attention of the army,

who has funded
his research

with millions of dollars.

The problem is, my father
wanted to save lives

while they just
wanted to destroy them.

Anything to report, Doctor?

l'm afraid nothing good,
General.

We succeeded in
controlling the toxin,

but the specimens
are showing

an uncontrollable aggressiveness.

We're experiencing an
irreparable side effect.

The toxin somehow acts on
the cerebral tissues,

destroying any
ability of the specimen

to keep the control over
its own aggression.

lt basically acts on
the nervous connectors,

enhancing ferocity at
an exponential level.

Try putting a steroid rat
into this cage

and in a manner of seconds,

nothing will be left of it.

These other animals are afraid
of this infected specimen,

so l must
keep it covered.

Not to mention the...

postmortem physical degeneration.

Explain, Doctor.

Well...

the toxin kills every
organism at a touch

and at our
current stage of research,

our experimental specimens
are nothing more than

walking dead bodies.

Very good, Doctor.

Very good indeed.

Did you not hear what
l just said, General?

Of course l did.

But people
die in wars,

or did you forget that?

Thanks to your discoveries,
Doctor,

we can now say we're
working ahead of schedule.

And this way, we can avoid
the boring procedure

of notifying
the families of the deceased,

am l right?

l'm impressed
by your work, Doctor.

You most certainly
are our man.

But now the time has
come to take your research

to the next level.

Soldiers.

What the hell do you think
you're doing, Carter?

The infection rate
is extremely high,

and don't forget,

we haven't succeeded
in controlling

the cytotoxin's
reaction to oxygen yet.

Do you have any idea
what would happen

if the substance comes
into contact with the air?

The slightest inattention

and the infection
would spread.

Are you out of your mind?
Watch your tongue, Doctor.

Surely you didn't
believe the millions

our government invested
into your research

were unsecured, did you?

We want results,
Neumann,

and you seem
ready to give us some.

Now... proceed.

Carter, for God's sake.

God?

Don't be stupid, Doctor.

God didn't
create any of this.

You did.

What are you
going to do?

l don't know, Sam.

l just don't know.

All l know is that l must
put an end to this madness.

l cannot allow that
man to use

my research
the way he wants to.

l just can't.

Yeah, but how, Dad?

lt's dangerous.

Listen, Sam.

Get on the first plane out of here,
just leave the country,

go back to the States,

to your mum's
But, Dad

You don't understand, Sam.

lt's my fault.

lt's my fault,

and l'm the only one that
can do something about it.

l have to do something
about it.

l need you to get as far
away from here as possible.

lt's not safe here
anymore.

That madman is
liable to do anything.

Just leave, please!

And don't try

and contact me
for any reason.

l'll stay in touch.

Okay.

Okay.

l know l can't
say antyhing

to make you
change your mind.

Just... promise me

you'Il be careful.

l promise.

My father tried to stop
the research at any cost.

But it was already too late.

He'd created
what they wanted.

A deadly weapon.

So he secretly synthesized
a vaccine,

certain that,
sooner or later,

it would have been indispensable.

So thanks to your father,

that bite mark
didn't turn you

into one of those things.

He injected me
with a vaccine

when he realized
how dangerous

what he was doing was.

l know he's got
a solution

for what's
happening here, too.

My father can stop all this.

He's probably working
at it this very moment.

Sam.
Believe me, Jack.

He can stop it all.
Sam.

Yourfather's dead.

He killed himself.

lt was in the file
General Carter gave me.

Freeze!

Drop the gun!

You don't understand.

l have to do this.

He probably couldn't accept
the responsibility

for what he caused.

l'm sorry.

Chief!

l've got a good idea!

What's the plan?

You know what
a pile of shite looks like

with flies around it?

l'm gonna create
a big pile of shite.

You're gonna have to
trust me on this one.

Go!

Have you got
any aspirin, chief?

l think they're gonna need it.

Sam.

Are you all right?

l think so.

You did good back there.

We're gonna make it,
you'll see.

Are you wounded?

No, l'm okay.

lt's just
a scratch.

lf you don't mind me interrupting

you two lovebirds,

l think we've got
a wee problem.

What do you think?

Aye.

Of course l can do it.

But you need to
give me some time.

John, time is one thing
we do not have.

Two minutes, that's all
l need is two minutes.

What brought you here?

lt's a long story.

l bet you don't
have time to tell me, right?

l don't think you want to
know why l'm here.

lf l didn't
want to know...

l wouldn't have asked.

lt's about her.

lt's all for her.

You saved my life.

l'm good with it.

lncoming!

John, my friend,
whatever you're doing,

do it fast!

Will ya slow down, chief?

l'm getting old.

Time's up, John!

Everyone in the car!

Fuck!
Oh, shit!

Everybody out!

Now!

No!

No, no, no!

Jack... Jack!

l can't hold them off
for long, guys!

Eden, come on!

lf we don't stop
for gas soon,

we're gonna run out
and we'll be on foot.

Jack, there!

Ah, so easy.

Sam, get out
and fill up the tank!

John, help me push!

Zombies!

Shit!

Get back, Sam.

Grab the dog
and follow me!

Shit!

Come on, get inside!

So who the fuck
are y'all?

l said who
the fuck are y'all?

You got a problem?

lt's nothing
l can't fix.

Don't play with him.

Come on,
it's okay.

l'm Jack Stone.

This is Eden.

This is Sam.

This irresistible bastard
is Mad Dog.

What about you?

You don't exactly
look like

a Romanian
factory worker to me.

Doug.

Doug Mulligan,
entrepreneur.

Shit.

We was on vacation 'til
those freaks turned up.

And, hell, we was
having a good time, too,

weren't we, sugar pie?

This here is Claire,
by the way,

and the dog's lndiana.

She don't
talk a whole bunch,

but believe me, she got many fine
hidden qualities.

Don't take it personally,
big fella.

She's been the silent type
since her psycho brother

killed her entire
family with a hammer.

Ma, Pa, little brother.

Yeah, it's some
pretty bad shit

and she's a brave girl.

l want to thank you again
for what you did outside.

l appreciate that.

Secondly,
and most importantly,

we've got to get
out of here.

Now, what's your
van situation like?

Well, shoot.

The tank's as empty as
your friend's skull here.

l was hoping to fill her up

and those freaks
turned up again.

l know if we wait it out
and stay real hushed

that they're gonna fuck off.

They don't seem
too bright.

That's not an option.

l wasn't joking when l said
we have to get out of here soon.

An atomic fucking bomb?

Here?

You're shitting me, right?

Well, what the fuck
are we going to do now?

General Carter's plans
include our deaths,

so here we are.

l'm sorry we got
you and Claire

involved in this, Doug.

Shit.

l thought this was
gonna be a nice,

relaxing trip,

but no, those goblin
donkey fuckers...

Always gotta mess with an
honest man's piece of mind!

Shit!

lf we're gonna die together,

we might as well die with
no hard feelings.

Drink up, my friend.

The amber nectar.

l didn't have
any hard feelings.

Friend.

What now?

l don't know.

l really don't know.

l guess l'm never gonna
open that restaurant.

Sorry, Dragan.

At least
we die with honor.

You guys
being serious?

No.

No, we can't give up.

Not while that timer
is still counting down.

lf we die here,

Carter will have it
all his own way

and nobody...

no one will ever
know the truth.

The airport is close.

We still have enough
time to get to it.

We have to get to it!

The world needs to know
what happened here.

Please.

Please?

She's right.

Fuck, l don't even know who
this Carter guy is,

but if this
fucked-up shit is down to him

then l certainly want to
give him

a very large
piece of my mind.

Fuck, l hate uniforms!

They're all
fucked in the head!

No offense, fellas.

But you gotta put yourself
in my shoes, okay?

l-- l nearly
died today, hmm?

Honey pie, you still
pointing that thing at me?

My God, the way
you carrying on,

the only memory you're gonna

have of this entire trip
is gonna be my ugly mug!

Well, at least it looks
like this goddamn rain

is finally quitting.

Ahh...

You should
point this thing out,

get some of this amazing
foreign scenery,

'cause, you know-- you know,

l think we are very
close now, you know.

l think we're
almost there.

Are you ready?

l said,
"Are you ready?"

To meet the one,

the only,
Count Dracula!

Oh, what is this now?

Shit.

Stay in the van,
honey pie.

Can you hear me,
sweetheart?

You okay?

Oh, what the fuck?!

Honey pie!

Oh, Jesus, God!

What the fuck?!

Get the shit out of my life,
you fucking crazy

You...

Next time, honey...

keep your eyes open!

l kid you not.

l almost did a little poo.

We're gonna have to
thin down their number

if we're gonna get
out of here alive.

Doug, how many bullets
do you have left?

Just two, l'm afraid.

Maybe we could
draw their attention

like we did back at
the police station.

How?

Holy shit!

l can't get a clear shot!

Fuck you!

Oh my God,
sweetness!

No, no, fuck you!

Honey pie!

No!

Jesus Christ, put the gun down,
darling, please?

Please, sweetheart,
put the gun down,

we'll be fine, we'll
we'll get you to a doctor,

l swear, you'll be fine,
sweetheart, please!

No!

Sweetie pie, no!

Nothing l can do...

Oh, God.

Sweetie pie.

Oh, please...
oh, God.

Jesus.

lf you got any good ideas

left in that
brain of yours, chief,

now is the time to
come up with it.

Without gassing up
the truck,

we're not going anywhere.

Maybe we can find
a vehicle around here

to get out of here with.

Maybe...

just maybe

we've still got a chance.

l still love you
so much, my sweetie.

What do you have
in mind?

You're gonna have to
trust me on this one, chief.

Princess.

How far to
the airport?

Five miles at the most.

l'm gonna try and buy you
as much time as possible.

Godspeed, my friend.

John...

Oh, God, no...

Mad Dog.

l'll be fine.

How are we gonna
know when to get out?

You'll know.

My friend...

you'll know.

Jesus Christ.

No!

And what are you
doing here, Princess?

Time to get
serious, John.

Serious?

Don't you think the timing's
a little bit off?

l think you should go,

before l get...
other ideas.

General Carter will get
what he fucking deserves.

Come on, now.

Get it together, man,
get it together.

Oh...

Fuck!

Come on,
you motherfuckers!

Come on!

Jack, just go!

Go!

All right, let's go!

Doug!

l'm gonna cut your friend
the General's eyelids off,

staple this here photo
to his forehead,

while l gut
him like a boar!

We'll get him.

Ugh, Dragan...

l think l'm gonna
need you on this one.

Come on then!

Ya wee shits!

Run, Eden, run!

Never!

John, Eden,
come on!

Get out of here!

God, God

lt is...

time to meet again!

Drive!

General!

What is it, Private?

They stopped just outside
the city's perimeter.

Orders, sir?

Tell the special forces
to be ready.

l want the girl.

Kill the others.

ls the helicopter ready?

Yes, sir.

Let's go.

We're running
out of time.

Yes, sir.

How many shots
do you have left?

Still just the two, Jack.

God, l tried to get 'em
to breed, but, you know,

they just ain't
in the mood.

Damn.

You have more
in common with John

than just a shitty attitude.

What's the plan?

l say we get out there,
we kill Carter.

Let's go.

Well, well.

l'm impressed.

l've got to give you
credit, Stone.

l underestimated you.

lt's a pity.

l could have
used a man like you.

And who's this...
hero?

Put the toy down.

Put it down, Doug.

lt's all right, girl.

He gonna get his.

You let her go.

Or l will kill you.

You're in no position
to be giving orders.

We placed the bomb.

My mission...
is accomplished.

Give me back my daughter
and let us go.

What more do
you want from us?

Her.

What?

You're much more precious than

you think you are,
Ms. Neumann.

You hold within yourself

the secret of your
father's great work.

l don't understand.

Your blood.

From that,
we will synthesize

your father's vaccine

and Project "K" can continue
without any more

unfortunate accidents.

lsn't it
a pity there's no room

for your new friends
in our helicopter.

l think we can allow
the little family reunion.

Christine...

in exchange
for Ms. Neumann.

After all, we're not
monsters.

Ms. Neumann.

Jack.

Shit.

Come here.

Well...

l think it's time we were
leaving, gentlemen.

Jack, run!

Go, get them!

All right, honey.

You stay right here,
and remember,

be really quiet, okay?

Jack.

You hold lndiana, she's
gonna keep you safe, okay?

They're a-comin'.

We gotta go.

Let's do this
Alabama style!

Come on!

You bastard!

l told you
l hate uniforms.

Come on!

Okay, honey,
you go with Doug

and run to the chopper.

l'm gonna go
look for Sam.

Jack, run!

No!

Shit!

Come on,
gotta keep up!

Go, Sam,
get to the helicopter!

Holy shit!

l don't know
where the hell you from,

but l know this is
gonna hurt!

Take that,
you son of a bitch!

Yeah!

You know, in the end...

that bastard got
what he wanted.

How do you mean?

The general's dead.

Ain't shit left of him.

Or the evidence.

l mean, come on, Doug.

Who's gonna
believe our story?

l wouldn't be so sure
of that, little miss.

l'd sure as hell like
to see 'em deny this.

Ahh, Jesus, God...

What the fuck?!

Get the shit out of my life,
you fucking--

You know, my old man
always used to say,

men don't learn shit
from their mistakes.

Anything
that happened once...

bound to happen again
sooner or later.

Well, Doug,
l don't know if a few men

can make a difference,

but sometimes it can be enough
to just kick the right ass

at the right time.

Come on, ladies.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
