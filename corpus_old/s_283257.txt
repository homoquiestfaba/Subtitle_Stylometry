This is my first mission

I want to shoot the whole process

Human memories are too complicated

As time passes, you may deceive yourself

What is recorded is reality

Last month
a shootout between police and criminals

left 5 police officers dead

7 police officers
are still in critical condition

In this mission
code named Panther Killer

Panther Duen, the younger of 2 brothers

responsible for many armed robberies

and operating
a drug trafficking syndicate

will go to court

to attend a hearing held 2 hours later

Apart from the HK Police
Interpol agents

sent from HK, China, America and England

who will help to prosecute Panther Duen

have come to give evidence that provides

the key to destroy
Duen's illegal businesses

Police, freeze!

Police!

I'm Pak Yut Suet I'm Wang Sun Ho

Hi, my name is Luo Zai Jun
Hi, I'm James Lam

I'm Pak Yut Suet I'm Hung Kei Lok

Hello Nice to meet you

I'm Luo Zai Jun Hello

Hello Hello

Lady, Gentlemen

Let me introduce to you
the officer in charge of this case

commander Hong Sun

On behalf of the Hong Kong Police
thank you

for bringing this evidence

I assure that both you and the evidence

will be taken to the court under our

strictest protection

Protect us?

I'm in charge of this case

I won't let anything untoward happen

This is your final order

Yes sir!

Let's go

What're you doing?

It's my first mission

I wanna shoot the whole process

Human memories are too complicated

As time passes, you may deceive yourself

What is recorded is reality

Sometimes it's not bad to cheat yourself

At least you can forget the sad stuff

Don't make things so complicated

I've forgotten many things

even my mom's birthday

It's my job to cheat myself

Otherwise how can I cheat other people?

Did you ever regret
being an undercover cop?

2 words: only once

We snipers hope
only a single shot will do

Miss, what's the matter?

Are you OK?

What?

Sit down

Don't worry

lt'll all be over soon

Everybody watch out

Beware of Panther

Ready

What the hell?

Watch Out!

Move!

Move!

Freeze! Hands up!

Freeze! Freeze!

Who's the asshole there?

Madam What?

We've fallen into Han's trap, run

Roger

Nobody's here?

Definitely not

The real prison van's
near the court by now

Why didn't you tell us?

We're not playing games here!

Calm down...

Attention

Patrol car's out of touch
in Central for 15 minutes

All the police officers
and firearms are missing

Roger out

Alpha Team

Move
Move out, A Team. Get on the car

Where're they going?

You punks!

What the hell

Calling all cars

The missing patrol car
and those firearms are still missing

B team watch out, ready for action

What's happening out there?

Sir, the police control car

and many dead officers are there

Go and see what's happening

Don't be scared, don't move

Calm down... Don't hurry

Don't hurry!

I've been looking for you

Cover me

You cover me!

Cover me!

Cover me!

Stay calm!

Please don't

No, please don't

Goddamn mother fucker!

Sir, please comment...

Sir, what's police next strategy?

Is there any new move?

Sir, will this case
pass to Interpol agents?

The Panther case is not over yet

I've no right to send you away

But if you do anything wrong

I do have the right to arrest you

Are you OK, Boss?

Isn't that the car provided for
our guests? It's a mess!

Those sons of bitches!

Long Yes

You take care of those goddamn punks

And never, ever let them drive!

Understand? Sure

He's a good dog

He's Friday, retired due to injury
still on salary

I'm gonna join him in retirement

In 5 days time

The head of an international triad group
Panther Duen

was abducted en route
to his court appearance

Listen to the news!

A cop should be more polite

You should at least call me 'uncle'

My name's Kong Long, I'm your senior

but you can just call me 'Long'

Please turn on the radio, Long

The news is over

The HK Police had so many casualties

And you don't care about it?

Colleagues died

others will take their place

Who'd go on patrol
if everyone went for revenge?

Who'd arrange your food
if I went off like that?

Do your part or the world will be a mess

I agree

There's a pub near your place
open 24 hours

Call me, anytime, no problem

Sister Morning

Brother

What are you doing here?

That's a big case, gotta go back

I've brought you something

Have you checked who they are?

I've told you many times

Do your best

Come and eat

Don't worry about me

I'm used to being here all these years

You still have a chance

You gotta do your best

Uphold the family name

Understand, Lok?

Sure. Now eat something

Be accurate...

Hey, what're you up to?

Give me 1 minute and I'll show you

Be accurate...

No money, no play

You're a sharpshooter

Somebody's waiting for you

Let me cover you

Can I try it?

A lefty sharpshooter indeed

I admire you

You're great! Ok

This is marksmanship

I only learned to shoot on the move

I'm not used to standing still

Please give me the chance

Let me borrow the gun

Let me shoot the rest

Thanks

This is what a sniper does

I feel

We make a good team

Team?

Why not?

They're well organized

obviously not just a local triad group

They use military tactics

I'm sure the sniper is a female

I hacked into the HK Police records

Apart from the sniper's weapon

their guns are those
used by the local police

One officer was stabbed to death
with a knife

One slash, straightforward

How would Tiger
get such a powerful group?

Guys, I think

target won't come out
unless we take action

I know what you're thinking

Let's go to Tiger's place to take a look

This is it

Do you know how much they earn
from this street?

Drugs, gambling, prostitution
visible and invisible

on the street and underground

$10 million a day

They've changed the working hours

Packing up so early? Then I ask you

Wouldn't they still want to make money?

Unless their boss was in trouble

Which means Panther wasn't rescued

but captured

Long

Who do you think did it?

This is a great location

Somebody wanted to rent it

We'll close the deal in 2 days time

Make your decision

Or I can't help you any more

Yuet, Sarge

Open his eyes

Ko...?

My brother will give your money back!

Let me go...

I never owed anyone

And I don't like...

to be owed

I'll give you everything back

Please let me go...

Let me introduce my new friend

This is Petros

Dominic's older bother

No, it was an accident

I don't mean to, no, I didn't kill him

It's okay

Dominic was a wild one

He spent his whole life
trying to get himself killed

Yeah

All things are negotiable

except the truth

And every lie has a price

Do it

I want to see Tiger Duen

What do you want with the boss?

It's Panther's ear!

Nobody move!

Tell Tiger that his old buddy came by

He knows what I want

Ching Tiger?

Send me some sms, I gotta work

Got it

How're you doing?

I'm fine, don't worry

I've been busy lately

I'll come to see you soon

OK

Be careful

Some colleagues say
Long walks his dog here every day

That Long has such an odd character

I'm afraid he won't help us

Don't worry

Asking for help is easier for women

I'll handle it

I want to know something
about you HK cops

About what?

For example

Do you need permission

before you date a colleague?

And, have you ever fallen in love

with your partner during a case?

I did worse than that

I fell in love with my target
when I was undercover

Believe it or not?

Thank you, come again

Pretty girl?

He's still young at heart

What's the matter, sir?

Where's your boss?

Hasn't come? Don't you know me?

Kong Sir

Need some help?

It's fine, everyone has hard times

I'll help you now, then you help me

What're you doing here?

Village boy!

I'm afraid I can't speak well

You talk with them

Come on

Suet

You wanna kill someone?

Watch out!

Wait

Please

Thank you Thank you...

You're welcome

Honestly, you should thank him

I don't need your help

I don't need your help!

I still care

Care?

Why didn't you care about
mom and me before?

I had so much work to do, I...

You always have so many excuses

Your work's important, isn't it?

You didn't even see mom before she died!

So many lives depended on me

I was the commander

I had to be responsible!

Got it
you only care for your colleagues!

Go to them now

Why come to me?

I know I was wrong

Can't you give me one more chance?

I didn't need your help before

Not now

or in the future!

I don't want a father like you!

I'll do what I promised

Based on the way they acted

I'm sure they're special agents

They break every rule
and it's hard to deal with them

You won't find them using normal methods

They're probably hiding in the city

as normal citizens and

planning their next move

Panther is the deputy, has no real power

I don't think he's their target

It's his brother, Tiger Duen

which means if we get to Tiger Duen

we'll find the agents as well

He has 4 special bodyguards with him

They're known as the Power 4

You gotta put them under surveillance

Look

Kong Long

Ko

You're still fast

Faster every day

I know you'd come to find me

Do you know why?

My face's still burns

So, how is your old friend?

Sharp as ever

He's not alone this time

Anything to drink?

No

Sorry

You've never known famine

I've seen men kill for less than this

They're just kids

Target practice for your team

But Tiger has been playing this game
for a long time

He won't fold his hand
unless we force him to

What's our strategy, Colonel?

There's an old Chinese saying:

You won't cry

until you see the coffin

My team will handle Tiger

And I'll find the girl

Excuse me

Do you speak English? Yes

Good, can you tell me the easiest way
to get to Hollywood road?

No, I'd love to help you
but I'm a tourist here myself

That's why you're taking so many pictures

That's right Right

Ok, alright, well, thanks anyway

Oh, it's you again

Hello

This I know you can help me with

Would you read my fortune for me?

What do you want to know?

I'm looking for a young woman

Do you think I'll find her?

Doesn't look so good. See right here

It says you'll be facing many obstacles

Well, eliminating obstacles
is my specialty

Maybe I can help you

Why don't you give me your number?

No, I think it's better that
we remain strangers

At least give me your name

You already know it!

Shit!

Bye-bye...

Ching

Wah

Going home? Come with me

Yeah, come with Wah I have to go

You bitch, don't get stuck up, get in

You think you're so goddamn special?
No, Wah

Are you OK?

OK

Thank you

Busy body? No, Wah!

Fight back?

No, Wah!

Ching, stay away

It's my fault Stand still

No, Wah!

Don't move!

Cops! Run, Wah No, Wah!

Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine

I'm so sorry

It's alright

Thank you

Are you sure you're OK?

Yeah, I'm alright

Besides, it looks like your shoes
get the worst of it

Thanks again

Good night

Why come to see me so late?

Tiger Duen

We businessmen
should pay back what we owe

This is for your dead comrades

And this is for you

You owe a lot more than this

Bat

Businessmen should have credit

This is for my brother's ear

Do you think you can get all the money

while you still have my brother?

Ko, either take it and let my brother go

or I'll kill you

Perhaps you'll decide to pay it

if we make you cry

in despair!

For you

Grenade! Run!

Soy sauce?

Freeze! Freeze!

Don't go!

Get after him!

Take the gun!

Shoot!

Shoot him!

I've no time to play with you

No, Tiger!

Let's move out

It's time for the next show to start

Yes, Colonel

Drop the gun!

Freeze! Shoot me!

Drop your guns! Shoot me!

Police! Freeze!

And two of you

Drop the gun!

Drop your guns!

Raise your hands!

Can't you give them one more chance?

Remember how your colleagues died?

It's because you didn't follow the orders

and wait for backup
That was my fault

These other guys

I'm sure they're Ko's agents

I know

I know how to deal with him

Hong, don't fool yourself again

Don't sacrifice your men
for the sake of fame

Work with the other departments

Listen to me

Give yourself a chance, and those kids

Honestly, it's Kong Long who saved you

You must thank him

Let's get some exercise

I'm with you

I've jogged on this road over 10 years

But I'll still get lost if I'm careless

It's not easy to follow the right track

You'll find your legs getting heavier

Until one day, you ask yourself

why you go on

In just a few days, I'll be off for good

What happened 3 years ago
wasn't your fault

No-one should blame you
for the deaths of your colleagues

You shouldn't hide away

You shouldn't feel regret

Let me tell you a story

I was only 10 in 1992

My dad was a cop

He and his 8 colleagues
had a gun battle with a gang

They took 47 shots in total

What happened?

4 cops died

My dad was one of them

13 years later

Their sons and daughters became friends

3 of them became cops

And I'm one of them

Do you know how we feel

when people talk about our fathers?

We feel so proud

We're proud of them

Kong Sir

We need you to take on the agents

Let me give you some advice

You can't beat them

That's why we need a leader like you

I once was lost

and it was so hard to find myself

I don't want to take the wrong road again

If you insist

do it yourselves

I hope you all make it back safely

Kong Long

We can do it without you!

Please

Make yourself at home

Would you like a drink?

Yes, thank you

Tell me, where are you from?

I was born in the States

but I left home when I was 15

Spent some time in Central America
Colombia mostly

then Eastern Europe

now I live in Thailand

Are you here on vacation?

Yeah, I guess you could call it that

I love to watch them fly

they are so free up there

Look, this is my younger sister

She's cute

This doll was a present from my boyfriend

when he still loved me

He made me promise to keep it

I kept my promise

but he did not

Here For me?

Yes, I wanted to
give you something because

you were so nice to me the other night

Do you like them?

They're beautiful

Allow me

Now, you can go to the ball

What?

Like Cinderella

Are you alright?

Whenever I am happy, I get scared

I know I'll be sad again soon

Do you know why the little angel
doesn't have a mouth?

Cos she likes to keep secrets?

You will find a smile on her face
when you are happy

and a sad face when you're upset

She can share all your feelings
