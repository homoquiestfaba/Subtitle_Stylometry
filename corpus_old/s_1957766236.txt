[magical music]

[ominous music]

[upbeat folk music]
[ominous music]

â™ª And the right to be free
â™ª

â™ª And to follow that great
freedom call â™ª

[thud pounding, dragging]

[thud pounding, dragging]

[thud pounding, dragging]

You got it this time, all right?

[ominous music continues]

[engine choking]

You ain't gonna do me like
that today.

Not today, Betsy. Not
today, Betsy. [Engine choking]

[engine blows]

[upbeat folk music]

[Josiah whistling]

â™ª Then pray to God for a
helping hand â™ª

â™ª With liberty for you and me
â™ª

â™ª Be gone my son

[ominous music]

â™ª As man have marched and
fought â™ª

â™ª For the freedom that we've
got â™ª

â™ª Freedom stars shine for you
and me â™ª

God I just, I just love
you, God,

and I thank you from
the bottom of my heart

for this food today.

I pray for Ma, I pray for Pa.

I pray for Mary and Eli, too.

Amen.

Saw the damndest thing this
morning.

Can't shake it.

It's difficult because the
sheer magical nature of it.

But uh,

I was up early on account of
my leg and uh,

went ahead on downstairs
and out the window,

just as the sun broke on the
horizon,

I see,

I see this little man.

And by little, I mean no
bigger than a half a foot or so.

And he's wearing this green suit

and he's got these funny
shoes that curled up at the tips.

And then this little man,
he just up and start dancing.

He's dancing in place.

A jig, a jig is what you'd
call it.

He's just jigging away,
faster and faster

and then he just up and stops.

Then what happened?

Well, he squats down all low.

He drops his drawers.

His face squench up.

And then it happened.

Pa, what happened?

He shat out a rainbow
out his little ass.

[Thomas laughs]

He shat it out all bright and
beautiful,

pulled up his drawers and run
off.

Ain't that something?

You know, listen Pa,
you know that ain't happen.

Leprechauns don't exist.

Yeah well, you think God exists

and you're ignorant
enough to believe that.

I suppose ignorant was a
poor choosing of my words.

It's a bad judgment, that's all.

You come with me tomorrow.

Would you like that?

You can drive.

[crickets chirping]

[tense music]

Ah.

[ominous music]

most of the main roads,

even put in that new filling
station.

I'm sure you've seen that.


[men laughing]

Biggest one he ever saw.

Well, you being an
assemblyman here in town and all,

we're gonna be perfectly
candid here.

Now, your town is all but dead.

Now the only thing keeping it
together

is our company's interests.

See, it all goes hand
in hand with our plans

to harvest oil from the shale.

Let's just cut to the
chase here, Mr. Gentry.

Any help we can get in
acquiring those outlying properties,

Well, we'd see that as a real
asset.

We're prepared to offer
generous commissions.

Well.

This is Willow Road,
that's the Graham property.

That'll be a tough sell.

Most have a price.

We have drafted some offer
letters

for all the parties involved.

I'm sure you will find that
the offers for compensation

are much more than market value.

That place has a bad history.


Mm-hm.

Anybody left around here
can tell you about it.

Something awful come about.

Cat's left that bag, Mr.
Gentry.

Well,

sometime back, we're talking
decades now,

the wife, her name was Miriam,

people around here called her
Mim.

Real big in the church.

Always made sure her twins
and the youngest boy, Tommy,

were present and dressed proper.

Real saint of a woman.

God tested being married
to a man like Josiah Graham.

This particular Sunday,
Mim was nowhere to be found.

Wasn't like her.

Tommy, he was especially
close to his mother,

he kept looking at the church
door,

trying to catch some sight of
her.

Never seen a boy so lost.

He run out mid sermon.

Figured he'd gone to fetch her.

[ominous music]

Found her hanging from that
old oak tree,

swinging dead from the neck.

Left to right.

People say that, that property,

I mean town folk.

They swear it's haunted.

The ghost walks that farm at
night.

Some say it's her.

Oh it's just town folk talk,
really.

That's some story.

Seeing as how you guys
need a friendly face

to help in acquiring that
Graham property,

figure any commissions
gonna have to be very generous.

[ominous music]

[Truck engine turns off]

You got money, boy?

I got that $10 that Mary sent.

10 whole dollars?

Well I can't figure if that
makes you or Mary rich, then.

It's for my birthday.

For your birthday.

Eli, he didn't, he didn't
send nothing.

If Eli had anything to send,

he'd probably whore it or
gamble it away.

First step that boy took
was a mud pile of trouble.

Get that outta your head, boy.

Tanner's my friend.

You ain't got no friends.

Don't you see him no more.

You know what that woman say?

Mrs. Tate.

She say I should keep that
retard of mine

locked up in the basement.

She say she gonna sick
that dog of theirs loose on you,

you ever try to see that boy
again.

She think you the village idiot.

Good for nothing simp.

That's what she think, all
right.

She can see anything she want.



[light pleasant music]

[tense music]

Pst.

[Mrs. Tate] Tanner.

Tanner, Tanner.

Come on, we gotta go.

You wanna get the magazine?

[upbeat music]

Come here, boy!

Hey!

I got the leprechaun jiggy
going!

Hey boy, look!

I'm a leprechaun!

Ah yeah! Happen every same
damn time.

â™ª Drink a little too much
shine â™ª

Come on, Pa...

No, you better not fall, Pa.
No.

Oh God, Pa! No, you can't
fuckin' do that now.

â™ª Now one day that wasn't
workin' â™ª

â™ª When the farmer's daughter
came â™ª

Here you go.

Pa.

[Thomas Laughs]

Pa, you,

Pa, you gonna spill this.

Hold on.

Pa, you gonna spill that.

Let me get that for ya.

There you go.

Get you ready for bed now.

Come on, you gotta wake up.

Pa, you gotta wake up.

Pa, wake up.

[Josiah grunts]

I wanna ask you something.

What is it you watching for

outside your window come
nightfall?

Oh, Pa it's,

Pa, I ain't lookin' at nothin'.

Ah, don't you lie to me.

You ever see her, Pa?


Ma.

She ain't out there.

Pa, I swear, people
been talking out there.

She ain't out there.

Pa, people say it.

That's what they been saying.
She ain't out there.

But they were, that they.

[slap smacking]

[Josiah incoherent mumbling]

[wind blowing]

[tense music]

[intense music]

[eerie music]

You can say what
you want to say to me.

It's important you awake.

It's important you understand
what I need to tell you.

Son,

whatever bad you got
inside you, come from me.

And everything good, it
come from your mother.

I done nothing wrong, Pa.

I know you think that and
I know this is hard for you,

but what's important is, is
we've been shown the way.

We've been given a way
to wash away our sins

and make peace with God.

You don't believe in God, Pa.

So.

Last night something happened.

Something you been trying
to tell me all this time.

Something I've denied for years.

God,

God watches us.

And your mother,

your mother's in the hellfire.

She killed herself, so
she wasn't there for you.

So she burns.

She suffers.

And we gonna burn, too.

You lying to me.

I am a liar, and I've been
a fool, but not no more.

[eerie music]

Last night, your mother,

she come to me and she
stood at the foot of my bed

and she told me that
you've been right all along.

She walk out there at night.

[Thomas crying]

Why I never seen her?

I never seen her, Pa.

Well she seen you.

She sees you watching from
that window.

And she wanna come to you, too.

She said she want to come to
you.

She to say, you ain't ready yet.

She say that we gotta right
our ways,

and she gonna send somebody
to guide us.

But they gonna come to me,
and me only.

And she say, if we right our
ways,

and we right a great wrong,
that we could save her.

We can save your mother, boy.

She say she love you.

She say she loves you the best.

Lord, we are grateful for
a whole mess of things.

We're especially grateful

for the chance to right our
wrongs.

We,

please get this strength to
Eli and Mary

and we'll pray for them, too.

Lord forgive us, amen.

Amen.

[intense music]

[wind blowing]

[Josiah panting]

[Something close by creaking]

[light ominous music]

[door opening]

[door creaking]

Mama.

Mom, is that you?

[tense music]

Pa, did you, did you see her?

I did.

She weren't alone.

Whatever she was with, it
spoke without saying a word.

Oh yeah?

I knew what it say,

it's like this voice come up
inside me.

It say, your mother,

she can't keep hidden from
these demons.

And that, and that we
got chores we gotta do.

First and foremost of which,

we gotta spit shine this
house, top to bottom.

Take pride in ourselves,
where we lay our heads.

That sit right?

And Ma, she say anything for me?

She ain't do no talking,
but that angel,

if that what it were, say he
got a chore special for you.

Say we need to take care
of things around here first,

and then you do what need be
done then.

Okay, Pa.

Ain't that somethin'?

Yeah, boy!

I'm noticed it!

[lightly upbeat music]


No morning tea?


Okay.

Give us this day our daily
bread,

and forgive us our trespasses,

as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

And lead us not to temptation.

[engine chugging]

Pa, where you at?

Pa?

God damn it, I know
exactly what to tell you, Pa.

Pa?

You God damn.

Pa, ain't gonna believe

Yet they under your bed.

Well, you only human.

Eli human, too.

Come on in here.

Sit down, come on.

God made women.

He gave man sight.

Pick one of them up.

Go on.

Flip it open.

Flip it open.

Yeah, find yourself a pretty
one there.

Oh yeah, she's a beauty.

Look at her.

You like them bumps and curves?

What is God's hand?

Temptation's the work of the
devil,

but resolve,

that's God's hand.

This bringing you back.

Bringing you back to when Eli,

he took you out there in the
shed and,

he showed you what's what.

That was long time ago, Pa.

Yeah, well that's
'cause you show resolve.

Yeah, ain't nothing wrong
with looking at whores, no sir.

You look at whores all you want.

As long as you got resolve.

But a man only has to
ride a bicycle one time

and he know how to do it twice.

Go on there and take it out.

No Pa.

Come on now.

I don't want you to touch
me there.

Pull it out!

Pull it out.

Pa, please.

You pull it out.
Pa, please.

Pull it out now.

Pull it out.

You know you can, you pull it

Please, I'm begging you, Pa.

Pull it out, boy.

You take it out.

You get over here and you

You take it out now.

It's not time for you to be
no sissy boy.

You take it out now.

You show me you're a man.

Show me how you do it.

Show me how you ride that
bicycle.

And I want you to go real slow,

and you let me see how it's

and you make me proud.

[Thomas masturbating]

Yeah, that's right, that's
right.

Yeah, look at them dirty
pillows.

Oh yeah.

[Thomas moans]

All right, now slow down,
slow down.

Don't go too fast.

Take it easy.

Take it easy, I want to see
how you do it.

[Thomas grunting]

All right now, you finish
up and get it done.

God is watching you right now
and you a sinner in his eyes.

You got to atone and
you're going to have to atone,

and we're gonna walk
down that path together,

for your mother.

Your mama love you.

And you finish up, boy.

You finish up, get it done!

[Thomas crying]

[ominous music]

The light that appeared
with your mother,

say there's something
else needs to be doing.

Says I need to wait till dark
to tell ya.

It's dark now.

No man or woman judges.

God's got something he wants
done, boy.

[lively music]

[woman moaning]

[lively music]

[radio busting]

I liked that song.

You could've just unplugged it.

You got that thing you said
you got?

Careful with that,
it ain't been cut yet.

That'll drop an elephant as is.

Kind of makes you a
prostitute, doesn't it?

There are worse things to be.

Do you even remember my
name, lover?

Yeah, it's Jenny.

It ain't.

[motor humming]

Shit.

You a couple weeks early!

Well, I like to stay sociable.

Breakfast of champions.

Hooch ain't why you're here.

Get up.

Turn around.

Put 'em together like you're
praying.

All right, easy now.

Come on.

God damn.

Nine year old girl
went missing last week.

Little ways outside of Austin.

Well this ain't a little
ways outside Austin.

It's close enough.

You're on my list.

You know anything about a
nine year old girl gone missing?

The only thing I know

is you're gonna make me late
for work.

Life ain't hard enough for you?

Words out that you're gambling
again and you're in deep.

Drinking, whoring.

How many violations you think
I need to put you back inside?

The answer is none.

I get one crooked hair up
my ass and you are done.

You know, I got some
Prep H inside the trailer,

you can help yourself.

You're funny.

Don't worry about being late
for work.

I had a talk with your boss,
man.

He was all sorts of unaware
about you being a nonce.

That's what I called it.

He didn't know what it was.

So I explained to him,

that's what they call
child fuckers in prison.

That girl was 16, she's
boozing up in a bar.

She told me otherwise.

You wouldn't know it by
looking at her.

All that, that was five years
ago.

I did my time for that.

Come on, you know that.

Only thing I know is a
crossed line

is awfully hard to step back
over.

You best go toss it.

Oh yes, sir, I'll do that.

You move an inch off your
throne, I'll shoot you dead.

Nonce.

[ominous music]

Hey.
[upbeat country music]

Here to see Boone.

Logan ain't seeing you, Eli.

I don't need Logan, I
want to talk to Boone.

Well, you know this.

You want to see Boone,
you gotta go through Logan.


Hey Logan, Eli's here to see
Boone.

himself, Billy?

yourself, Eli.

Hey, I got, I got money.

He says, he's got money.

says he's got money.

Tell him to fuck himself, Billy.

He seems resound, Eli.

Know what man, I'm fucking,
fuck you.

I'm not doing this shit.

Hey, you fucking dope.

[Billy laughs]

Shit.

[gun cocking]


You boys done blowing each
other?


No shit.

Come on then, hey, come on.

God damn it, man.

Can't make a bloody
Mary to save your life.

You're the only one that
drinks them.

Have a seat, Eli.

I apologize Sheriff, where
were we?

Oh, he's no bother.

Eli, I'm gonna give the
Sheriff here

an envelope full of money.

There's a little bit
extra in there, Sheriff,

on account of your anniversary.

Sheriff's been married 40 years.

God bless.

Sheriff, always a pleasure.

Eli, is it?

You owe me money,
of the substantial variety.

Four hundred and eighty dollars?

You're in for a mess more
than that.

Forgot, you know, I got
something else.

That ain't even been cut yet.

That's worth two grand, at
least.

on my desk?

Did you just toss smack on my
desk?

Do I have to ask the
fucking question again?

All right.

I'm gonna have you killed, Eli.

Dead and buried.

And there won't be a soul
in the world who'll give a shit.

I'll work it off.

I'll work off the debt.

I'll tend bar.

I'll even clean the shitters,
you know, I'll do...

You want me to put you on
the payroll?

Well you might as well start

by hitting me in the dick
with a hammer.

'Cause that'd be about as
appealing to me.

I'll get it.

I'll get you the money.

Forgetting immediate
unpleasantries committed,

you getting me my money

is the general nature of the
conversation

we're about to have.

You ever hear of Romani.

Gypsies.

From Germany, Romania,
wherever, over there.

Most come after the second
World War.

Jews got the bum wrap, sure,

but Hitler's boys, they killed
communists and radicals.

Gimps, retards and queers.

Generally anyone they
disagreed with, or couldn't trust.

Gypsies being part of that
congregation.

You know why Nazis pulled Jew
teeth?

'Cause Jew teeth had gold
fillings,

and them Nazis took their share.

Little here, a little there.

Bunch of gold adds up over
the years.

Them Gypsies comes
through these parts each year,

with a carnival.

They pitch their tents and
then move on.

And this part of the story

is the part you best pay
attention to,

'cause it's a fact, Jack.

[tense music]

A week back, a man sat
downstairs,

got himself drunk at my bar.

Kept going on about them
Gypsies.

Said he was one of those Romani.

Told that tale about Jew gold,

and how this clan, these
carnies,

were sitting on 10 bars of it.

Said for the right price,

he might know where they
stash it.

They pitch their carnival tents

on a lot I got down by the
rail yard, just outside Odessa.

You're goin' with Logan and
Billy

to see if that gold story's
true.

You gotta be shittin' me.

I got all sorts of friends

collecting all sorts of
envelopes.

Clear your markers.

Have that record of yours
wiped clean.

New start for you.

Or I kill you right here and
now.

Gypsies, huh?

Go figure.

Three of you,

going over to Odessa,
coming back with Jew gold.

You fuck it up,

those two gonna take another
initiative.

[tense music]

They say if a dog howls for
no reason,

there's trouble coming.

Gypsy lore.

[thunder roaring]

Lightening without rain,
these are omens.

That's just heat lightening.

Yeah?

Well,

I find it best to be
educated, so let's see.

They navigate by moonlight.

If it's obscured, they stay put.

They never get married
if a shoe falls out of a tree,

and crows are bad luck.

They put a curse on everything.

How would a shoe fall from
a tree?

Well, it must have
happened at some point

if they're deciding
something like marriage on it.

Whoop-de fucking do, are
we gonna do this shit or what?

What are we waiting for?

All right, tenderfoot.

Now remember, we go in,
we have a few drinks,

then Logan and I will close
out the tab.

Now this is their last night,
so they're gonna be partying.

As soon as they're good and
sauced up,

Logan and I will go after the
gold,

you keep them distracted.

You know where it's at?

Well that's none of your
business, Eli.

You ain't gotta do shit but
sit, drink,

and entertain the pretty girls.

That's all we need from you.

Can you do that?

[lively Romani music]

[singing in foreign language]

the beer. [Laughs]

Howdy.
Hey.

We're looking for Marco.

Boone's guys.


Come on in.

Welcome, gentlemen.

Eh, a little fiesta before
we leave town tomorrow.


You guys want beer?

Beer?
Please.

Towne, beer for everyone,
please, come on.

So you're Marco.

I am, yes.

So you're having a little party?

Oh yeah.


[people chattering]


No no no no.

Dude, watch out.
[men laughing]

Towne.

There we go.

Everybody get a beer.
Thank you.

Follow me in the back,
gentlemen.

Whoa [laughs] Eli!

You're cute.
Eli, I'll be back.

Got my eye on you.

[lively music]
[people clapping]

Can I help you with something?

What are you doing here?

Doing some business.

Just doing some business.

That's it.

Yeah.

Good.

That's good.

What's your fucking
problem, huh?

to see you.

[hand smacking]

Now!

Sorry about that, he's
kind of a bad drunk.

Here, please.

I already got one.

Thank you.

I'm Gina.

Hey.

Where'd you learn to dance
like that?

It's very traditional in my
culture.

Taught very young.

I never seen it before.

Maybe you'll have to try.
[giggles]

I could teach.

I don't think I could
ever learn to do that,

hand, you know, whatever
that was, the leg shaking stuff.

I'd love to see you do this.

So what are you doing here?

Just finishing up some business.

With uh, whatever, boss man
is in there.

Did you get a chance to
take part in the festivities?

No.

Shame, we leave tomorrow.

Maybe I'll catch you on the
next one.

All right.

Ever seen a medium before?

What?

Fortune teller.

Oh no, no.

I, I don't have much fortune.

I don't think.

Well this one's special.

I'm not a talker, you know?

That's, that's what it is.

It's good to know, I like that.

What are we doing here?

What's your name, handsome?

What are we doing here?

I don't know yet.

But I don't know one
shouldn't pass up a reading

if she's willing.

And that this is our last night.

And I don't know anything
about you.

James.

Mr. James.

I'll be right back.

What am I doing here?


[eerie music]

Are you serious?

[speaking in foreign language]

Give her your hand.

[speaking in foreign language]

[speaking in foreign language]

Says you're easy on the eyes.

[speaking in foreign language]

[speaking in foreign language]

You're impatient.

[speaking in foreign language]

[tense music]

[speaking in foreign language]

You've come through quick
hardship.

You keep secrets.

A burden.

My hands are scarred from work.

Skin's leather from the sun
and everybody keeps secrets.

Should've pulled out that
crystal ball.

At least it would've looked
the part.

[speaking in foreign language]

going to die.

Everybody dies.

[speaking in foreign language]


You not save her.

[tense music]

[tea kettle Whistling]

[Mama Luna] Drink.

Straight down.

This is a real show, stranger.

[tense music]

[speaking in foreign language]

You are why she burns.

Why who burns?

Mother.

What the fuck she just say?

She said your mother.

[speaking in foreign language]

[tense music]

[man laughing evilly]

[intense music]

[Mama Luna crying]

[speaking in foreign language]

[speaking in foreign language]

That tea.

You run from something
unspeakable.

It's not finished with you.

[speaking in foreign language]

You came to settle the debt?

Can't move.

[speaking in foreign language]

You've come for our gold.

[ringing drone]

[eerie music]

[intense music]

[baby whimpering]

[people whispering]

â™ª My Mom she died in a fire
she set â™ª

â™ª The law man was stated

[ringing drone]

[Eli moaning]

Raven tea packs a punch,
don't it?

What the fuck happening, man?

What'd you put in that shit?

[Marco laughs]

out, broth a.

Dead and buried.

Those were his words.

Can you watch her?

I'm gonna go help them start
closing up.

Ah.

This is worth a lot more than
money.

Goes way back with us.

But you, you didn't do it for
gold.

It was different for you.

Oh, don't pretend to know me.

You're a low rent homicidal
Gypsy cult.

You kidnap kids and you
murder people.

So just save me all the hooey
bullshit

just fucking do what
you're gonna do to me.

But little girl you took, the
police been looking for her.

You should let her go.

Gina can't have any kids.

Mama Luna says you got a beng
on you.

That's the devil.

She says you've seen him, too.

Well then I guess you're
just doing me a favor.

It's nothing personal.

Here, stay awake.

It's gonna be a long
night clearing out of here.

And get rid of this fat fuck.

[oldies music]

[Miggs snorting substance]

Man you're too God damn
big, huh?

You like to party, big boy?

Oh. Hold on, I'm just, I
got something for ya here.

â™ª Such a long, long time
â™ª

â™ª And I love you so

It's the best snort in
all of Texas, right there.

Be a real shame to waste it,
I guess.

It's all yours.

Just make it quick with
me and we're square.

[Miggs snorting drugs]

[Miggs laughs]

[Miggs snorting drugs]

Ooh! [Laughs]

[Miggs exhales]

[Miggs snorting drugs]

Fuck.

Might even throw one for you.

I can't exactly show up

You could have just left her.

They aren't just my concerns.

You've been through
the application process

Well, two other agencies as
well.

May I ask why tubal ligation?

Um, I had the procedure

But sterilization is an
extreme measure.

Yes.

I uh,

I made the, I made the decision

before I knew I was meant to
be a mother.

[Social Worker] You
filed for separation.

There was accusations of
infidelity.

Uh yeah, that was um,

that was six years ago.

We, you know when you,

when you're having
difficulties you,

Be a teacher?
Not for everybody.

Be a teacher?
Mm-hm.

Oh.
Mm-hm.

I could do middle school.

Oh.
Uh-uh.

That's too, that's rough.

Both of your kids are off
at school?

[Kirk] Oh, it's killing her.
It's not, really.


I, I don't care how old they
get,

I'm always gonna need that
mama fix.

Oh, 'cause they're her babies.

Well, speaking of which,

what's going on with your thing?

Is there any updates?

Ross and Mary are trying to
adopt.

Oh.

Well, we're in,

we're just in the process of
that.

Well that's wonderful.
Thank you, yeah, thanks.

Dan, we can talk about that

What's wonderful about it?

[Effie] I miss it so much.

No, it's fine.

You know, I, this is my fault.

I shouldn't have said anything.

No no no no.

It's, I promise it's not your
fault.

It's not a big deal, at all,
it's not.

No.

But I just, I'm.

I'm sorry,

I just really want to know
what's so wonderful about it.

Hey, we can just kind of,

It's the first time
she's been to our home.



how do you know what kind
of parents we would make?


I think maybe you just
misunderstood what she was.

It's, it's fine.

I was just trying to be polite.


But you're right, Mary.

I don't know a thing about you.

here.

How bout that?

Great.
Smooth cabernet.

Even though we've topped

Okay, who, you're good.

Can I get you some more?

Cheers.

which is my favorite part of the meal.

[Effie] Yes, yes.
[Kirk] Desert. Desert

[ominous music]

Did you stop taking these?

Counting my pills now?

Yeah.

I mean I thought,

I thought we were
working on this together?

I mean after the shit you
pulled tonight

I don't know what's going on.

That's not working together.

Counting my pills, that's
not fucking working together.

You asked me if I ever get mad.

I'm always mad.

I'm always mad, but I can't
say anything

'cause I'm so fucking terrified
you're gonna kill yourself.

Whoa, kill myself?

I had some crazy fucking idea

that a baby was give you a,

give us like a fresh start,

but if you can't stay on track,

how the fuck you expect me to?

It's like you're punishing me.

All this shit, you know
what this tells me?

You're not in this with me.

Do you know how embarrassing
that was for me tonight?

Do you know what you
fucking said out there?

I was just being honest.

You got this fucking
narrative in your head.

No one's against you, at all.

You're right.

Baby, I'm not trying to
punish you.

You deserve,

you deserve so much better.

And you always have.

But please don't ever assume

that you know what a
child will mean to me.

[Ross humming]

[ominous music]

Hi.
Hey.

I'm sorry.

[knife slicing]

No it's, it's fine.

It's not your fault.

[knife slicing]

Don't you ever get mad?

[ominous music]

Don't you ever get mad?

Don't you ever get mad?

[knife slicing]

Don't you ever get mad?

Don't you ever get mad?

[knife slicing]

[Mary screaming]

Baby, come on.

Mary, oh no no.

No no no no no.

It's a dream.

Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.

[Mary panicking]

Wake up, wake up, wake up.

It's all right, it's all right.

[Mary panting]

It's okay, it's okay, you're
okay.

You're okay, okay, okay.

What happened, babe?

What was it, sweetheart?

I don't know, fuck.

It's all right, it's
all right, it's all right.

It's okay.

[tense music]

like to ask you something.

What is it you need?

Um,

I uh.

Okay, let me put it this way.

What purpose would a child
serve you?

[Mary exhales]

Ma'am, there is um,

there's a hollow inside me.

I uh, I can't ever fill it.

Not, not even with a child.

It um, it burrows, deep
inside me.

But uh,

there's something else.

There's something beautiful
and loving,

and it is there for a reason.

It is,

it's there so I can give
it to somebody else.

I need to give it.

If I don't then,

then only the hollow exists.

I um,

I want a child because
I need to give love.

[Mary cries lightly]

[tense music]

What the fuck?

No, no no no no no no.

[door opening]

Ross?


[Man] See you.
[Ross] Okay.


You get my calls?

He just showed up.

I mean, we gotta talk
about this but I gotta go.

All right, I'll catch you
later, all right, Eli?


Yeah.

You have no right showing
up like this.

Well now, he didn't
seem to feel the same way.

I told you I didn't
want to talk about it.

Good, all you gotta do is
listen.

Eli.

Hear me out, and I won't
bother you about it no more.

You look rode hard and put
away wet.

Yet you get prettier every day.

God, Mary, it don't matter
where I lay my head.

I left a heap of trouble back
in Texas.

Skipped my parole.

It's a matter of time
before it catches up to me.

This letter.

I know what it says.

Okay, well then, then you
know what they're offering.

That kind of money,

well that could, that could
really get me outta things.

That could get me a new start.

Look, this oil company, right,

that just, outta nowhere
they wanna buy the farm.

This, this is a lottery ticket.

We just, we need all of
us to sign off on it to sell.

Anything come from there is
no good.

We all had it bad.

us worse than others.

All you gotta do is sign.

That's it, it don't have
to go no further than that.

I'll take care of the rest.

Hey, you remember that game

we used to play when we were
kids?

How I'd ask Mary, may I?

You'd have to do it no matter
what?

[ominous music]

I'm asking again.

I need this, Mary.

I need it.

I want to go back.

I'll go.

No, you don't, I'm not
asking you to do that.

No, I want to see it through.

I want to know it's gone for
good.

You get Tommy to sign yet?

Hell Tom, Tommy won't talk
to me.

You know that, I, it's been a
long time.

Do you blame him?

Not at all.

If he'd give me the time
of day I'd tell him that.

But you, you're in contact
with him, now and again, right?

God.

What would anyone want with
that farm?

If you go, you need to
convince Tommy

it's time to let the place go.

Eli, what about Pa?

Don't worry, I'll deal with
our father.

[haunting whistling music]

[Eli pounding on windshield]

You okay?

You just gonna stay in there
or what?

[tense music]

[door creaking]

Tommy.

Look at you.

Oh, God.

Oh, God.

You're so much bigger than I
remember.

Yeah, I've always been big,
Mary.

I just ain't seen you in so
long.

I'm sorry.

[footsteps approaching]

Hey Tommy.

[Thomas crying]

Tommy, I'm sorry.

Hey, Tommy.

Yeah.

Hey, you got any hootch in

Oh yeah.

You know I got some hootch.

Let's go get some.

Come on.

Oh, I've been, I wear the.

I like your jacket, Mary, it
matches mine.

Yeah, we do.

Kinda, you know?

Come on in.

I figured you two would be
here earlier.

How'd you figure that?

How'd you know we were coming?

I got a letter from the oil
company.

Y'all staying the night?

Oh.
Is that a joke?

Oh, you know, like old times.

I been fixing it up.

Making the house real special.

I'm gonna go finish getting
ready.

Well come on in.

Thank you.

Make yourself at home.

Thank you.

[light switch clicking]

[ominous music]

Eli look like he been
through a hard spell.

Mary looks as pretty as ever.

[Josiah] Pretty as ever.
[laughs]

Steady, boy.

[bell ringing]

Ah, thank you, Jesus.

That's a familiar sight.

[tense music]

Best get to it, then.

[tense music continues]

We should leave it all.

They start digging,

they might hit something
we can't have them finding.

Eli...

That sink hole is
still down by the creek.

It's a salvage dump.

They're gonna fill it soon
enough and,

ain't nobody gonna look at
what's in it.

20 minutes.

Eli, I sat in the car for 20
minutes before I could go in.

You went in, right?
[ominous music]

That's all that matters.

[ominous music continues]

God, what are we doing here?

You see, son?

God don't lie.

Your mother, she saw it.

Saw what they were all these
years.

Drove her mad.

Couldn't turn it off.
[baby whimpering]

They the reason she burn.

[tense music]

[tense music]

Been fixing the place up.

Yeah, you already said that.

Yeah?
Mm-hm.

Come sit with me, Tommy.

[tense music]

Okay.

Yeah, okay.

[ominous music]

How you doin'?

Really?

Oh, you know, getting along.

You uh,

you seem glad to see Eli.

I'm glad to see you both.

Well, he was afraid you
wouldn't be.

He says he's been trying

to get a hold of you for a
while now.

Oh yeah?
Mm-hm.

I saw that. [Laughs]

Yeah.

That's a lady bug.

Well I say the past is the
past, you know?

All that matters is we here now.

The letter, Tommy.

There's some men from an oil
company.

I guess they want to buy the
farm.

[phone vibrating]

Will you give me a second?

Be my guest.

Take your time.

[ominous music]

[thud pounding, dragging]

Is everything okay?

Ross?

Why, what is it?

decision, baby.

Mary, you're gonna be a mother.

[Mary crying]

Mary?

Oh my God.

Ah, I can't believe it.
Ah...

Hey Mary, you still there?

Mary?

Best get to it, then.

[Eli panting]

[tense music]

gonna have ourselves

a little sit down, huh?

You guessed right.

[intense music]

Is there something you
wanna tell us?

Tell it, boy.

Tell him what your mama say.

Ma,

she's in the hellfire.

Hellfire?

You figure ma's in hell, is
that it?

I figure we all gonna be,
unless we change our way.

You need to live pure,
righteous.

I doubt I'm ever gonna be
saved, Tommy.

Sure as shit ain't gonna be
pure.

What the fuck do you
about being righteous, huh?

This here's a restraining order.

Your ex-wife's attorney.

That,

that ain't real.


What about out back?

Yeah, you know what I'm
talkin' about.

Is that real?

Your ex-wife, Tommy.

Her name's Catherine.

She left you a year ago.

She remarried a man named Tate.

He's your boy's stepfather.

He's my best friend.




All these letter right here,

they're telling you to keep
away from them.

Says you hadn't been doing it.

Is that why you moved
back here? To the farm?

How long you been here, hm?

What the hell's goin' on with
you?

The two of you.

Ma, she saw it.

She killed herself 'cause of it.

You know you two had that baby.

Oh shit.

Tommy, you, you don't
you know, do you?

What do you mean?

That baby came from Pa.

Liars!
[fist slamming table]

Liars! Drowning in their
unholy semen of their incest!

Stop no.

Okay.



Who the fuck you talking
to, Tommy?

[Eli] Huh?
Boy, you know the truth.

You tell him what I saw.

Pa.
[Mary gasps]

Oh my God.

Oh my God.

Oh the lord!

You sin together.

You still sin together.

You were at that motel
before you come home.

watching us, Tommy?

And you sinned again.

I'm shacking up at that motel

'cause I got nothing to go
back to.

And Mary, she came and met me.

She followed me up the rest
of the way

so we could do this together.



He'll forgive you.

Pa'll forgave you, I forgive
you.

Ma would forgive you.

Tommy listen, okay.

Pa has been dead and
buried for 23 years now.

You're not listening.

been dug up.

He's trying to save us.

Save us?

You know how you got your ear
like that?

Pa found you playing with his
pipe

and wanted to teach you what
happens

when you play with his things.

So he heated up an iron

and he stuck it on the side
of your head.

You were four years
old when that happened.

Me, he liked to use a strap.

Said it wasn't a lesson
unless it bled.

He taught me lots of lessons.

And Mary,

well, well that was
something different, wasn't it?

[intense music]

The old man had nothing
better to do

than to mark his boys and
to fuck his own daughter.

[Mary crying]

When Mary got pregnant,

that's when Ma killed herself.

That's when the three of us
did it.

23 years later,

and I'm still trying
to get rid of the past.

You gonna ask for forgiveness.

You need help.

23 years later,

you're still crazy as shit,
Tommy boy.

And if Pa is speaking to you,

he ain't trying to save us.

That old bastard just wants
revenge.

You need to sign these
fucking papers

so we can get rid of this
place once and for all.

You got it?

You need help.

You two killed that baby.

Took a long time finding it.

We all together now.
