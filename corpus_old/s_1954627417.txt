doll as a gift."

So beautiful and nice."

"She seemed not created
for this world's sorrows."

Mom.

Mom.

IRELAND 1890
MIDSUMMER NIGHT

Diana!

I followed the baron to the train.
Strange that Miss Julie is not traveling.

All friends celebrate midsummer
together. Big event.

He gave me the boots to polish
and switched to something grander.

His SUPERCILIOUSNESS.
His most divine gentility.

His vanity, most stylish supremacy.
Sir Boots, I think.

Baron went into the station
and asked me to wait.

When he came out
la have something in a folder.

Guess what was in the folder.
A stack of travel brochures.

As if people like me traveled so.

But no money.
They do not think so, the people.

No, they do not think so.

At the barn, I asked the stableboy
bring home the horses and I went Check

and saw Miss Julie cite dance
with the gamekeeper. Skogkvaktaren!

When she sees me she comes rushing
and command me to dance with her.

She thinks he can control all.

Who am I?
I can not control anything.

Oh, Kathleen, come and see the pictures.

Paris. Rome.

This is Lake Como.
I know that area.

Jeez, what beautiful it is.

I'm hungry!

It's kidney, your favorite foods.
Lovely.

<i>Yes, this is my big dÃ©lice.
You would have warmed my plate.</i>

You are harder to please than the Baron.

Give me a glass.

<i>A real glass. A nicely.
When you drink wine nests.</i>

That's right.
It's a bit too cold.

What are you cooking like stink so?
Something bastard nity to the lady's dog.

Miss Julie
believe that it is pregnant again.

Because she has been closely
Forester's dog.

Miss Julie said she saw them
and it made her nauseous.

She'd rather risk that the dog dies
than get a mixed breed. God help her.

You should have seen her
come to the dance.

She looked as if had been
on the ground and took a nap.

We had not behaved so.

But still - she is elegant,
Miss Julie.

Magnificent.

Oh, her waist. Her neck.
Stop.

I have heard Clara talk.

She has seen her naked
often as she bathes her.

Clara for squint
to see something right.

You women always envied each other.

I've ridden with her
and know her.

How she sits on the horse.
Her legs.

And how she dances.

Well?

Is that clear?
My fetuses driving married?

Is it a WITCH BROTH the ladies
concocts on Midsummer Eve?

Listen.

Come on, dance with me again.

No offense, but I have promised
to dance with Kathleen.

Let me borrow him, Kathleen.
You can go and rest.

If Miss Julie is so friendly
he can not say no.

Go you, John.
Be grateful for the honor.

Frankly, without
wanting to offend somehow...

Miss Julie should perhaps not dance
twice with the same partner.

What are you talking about?
I, house hÃ¤rskarinna-

honors the people dancing in the barn
with my presence.

But I have to dance with the one that
, the steps so I do not look ridiculous.

As you command, Miss Julie.

I am at your service.

I have chosen to put away all rank
and it must also do.

Come on, give me your arm.

Thank you, John. I do not want
treat you like a child.

We walk through the entrance hall.
It had you thought about, right?

Do not be afraid, Kathleen.
I do not hold with your fiance.

That's what he is?

You are a man of the future, is not it?

Diana, come here.

Come here.

Poor little thing. I know.

I lay not so much in your food.

Most of it was fine meat.
You will recover.

Listen.

Do you like it?

Stay here.

I left her.

She is weird, Kathleen.

She's always weird.

Are you mad at me?
Why?

For small items that you two went away?

You're a clever girl, Kathleen.

You become a good wife.

Can you imagine what the Baron had
say if he saw her behavior?

Did you see her?
If I saw her?

Is it possible?

Are you flattered?

But do not act like a blackguard.

You are just a charming cavalier
running away from a lady.

As you can see
so I hurried blowing

to be with the lady
that I had abandoned.

Why do you wear your livery on
Midsummer Night? Promptly remove it.

Then I get to go to my room.
My black coat hanging there.

Go to your room then.

I'm going with and look to
that you are not running away from me again.

Miss Julie! With your permission -
I can go get it?

Kathleen, are you and John got engaged?

Engaged?

You seem so intimate.

In a way.
We call it that.

Do you call it?
Is not Miss also engaged?

Miss Julie, I'm tired.
Can I go to my room and...?

<i>TrÃ¨s gentil, Monsieur John.
TrÃ¨s gentil.</i>

<i>Vous voulez plaisanter, madame.</i>

<i>Et vous voulez parler francais.</i>

Where did you learn to speak French?
In Switzerland.

I was sommeliers
at a hotel in Lucerne.

<i>You look like a perfect gentleman.
Charmant.</i>

You flatter me.
Why would I flatter you?

My modesty forbids me to faithfully

that you would give to me
so honest compliments.

So I guess you flattered me
or worse, was condescending.

Where did you learn to speak so?

You had been surprised
all the places I have visited.

But you are born in this neighborhood, huh?
My father worked the land over there.

I visited your garden
long before I started working for the Baron.

I saw you when you were a little girl.

But you, Miss Julie, did not see me.

Who gave you permission
to walk in our garden?

I remember once...

No. I will not tell it.

Is it offensive?
No.

But Kathleen can hear me.

From his room?

I think she snores.

She does not.
But she talks in her sleep.

How do you know?

Why do not you sit?

It would not be fitting
before Miss Julie.

If I command you to do it then?
Then I'll obey.

Give me something to drink.

I do not know what we have in the icebox.
I think it's just beer.

My tastes are simple.

I want beer.

Miss Julie.
Thank you. Will not you drink?

I do not like beer,
but if you command me...

A gallant should be well
keep his lady companion?

It's true.

Drink my bowl.

Are you shy?

For your health, Miss Julie.

Bravo.

Kiss now my shoe,
for it to be just right.

Excellent.

You would have become actor.

This is not acceptable.

Miss Julie. Someone might see us.

What would it do?
They had begun to talk.

You should have heard them when we danced.

What did they say? Put yourself.

Tell.
You're not a child.

When you see a lady drinking alone
with a valet at night...

We are not alone. Kathleen is here.
We pick her.

Let her be!

Huh?
Do not disturb the sleeper.

She has stood by the stove all day and
even prepared food for your dog.

She deserves his rest.

What kind you are.

Shall we go and pick lilacs?

I can not do it.
Absolutely not.

I command you.

Go.

Excuse me, Miss Julie.

She got sick of soup
as you asked me to give her.

And I gave her barely anything.
It could have killed her.

I like to take her out in the sun.

She loves to run around
in circles in the grass.

Then she lies on the hot
stone staircase with the sun on your back.

I understand.

You can keep her.

The Johns. Take the rest.

I sent him out
to pick flowers for me.

Syrener.

Miss Julie, I'm tired.

And if you do not need me more,
can I get to sleep?

Why did not you go out
in the garden with me?

I do not understand what you are afraid of.

My father is not even at home
and the other people...

They are hired to work here,
you.

Do you think they would believe
I'm in love with a bejÃ¤nt?

These things happen.

It's possible.
Which imagination.

I can come down.

Not step down, Miss Julie.
When they say that you fell.

You guys are weird.

So are you. Life is strange.

People - everything.

We are just foam that floats
water until we drop.

Sometimes I dream that I'm up
on a pillar and can not come down.

I almost faint when I look down,
but I must come down.

I'm so afraid of falling.

I can not keep myself longing
after the fall, but I do not fall.

No peace, no rest
until I come down.

I had stepped down, I had fallen.

And if I hit the ground
I want to get further down.

Deep in the ground itself.

Have you ever felt this way?

No...

I dream that I below
a tall tree in a dark forest.

I want to climb the top-

and look out over the bright landscape
where the sun skiner-

so that I can raid the nest
where the golden eggs is.

And I climb and climb,
but the trunk is so thick and health

and that's as far
to the first branch.

But I know that if I
can reach the first grenen-

-so I would easily reach the top.

I have not reached it yet...

That first branch,
but I will do it.

If it just gets in my dreams.

Are you ever afraid to hear
that you are no longer required?

That you do not belong?

I shared a bed with my little brother
and one morning when I was eight.

I woke up and found him dead
beside me.

I saw death for the first time
and was scared, but not as you think.

My little brother in his open coffin.

The chill crept into my spine then.

It is always there. It is in me.

I never go back
to the one I was born into.

Where I belonged.

We pick nine midsummer flowers
and put them under our pillows-

so go all our dreams
true.

What do you have in your eye?
A little soil, it will disappear soon.

Sit down.

Sit still.

Cross. I think you shake.

<i>Careful.
Je ne suis qu'un homme.</i>

Sit still.

Yes.

Now it's gone.

Kiss my hand and say thank you.

Kathleen is near. Listen to me.

Kiss my hand first.
Listen to me.

Blame yourself then.
For what?

Are you a child?

You are playing with fire.
No, I'm dreaming.

It makes you not.

Ashamed.
I said ashamed, John!

Did you know?
Yes.

I'm tired of this game
and want to go and work.

Baron comes home tomorrow
and want to have their boots polished.

Stop!

I forbid it. Set them down.
No, it is my duty.

He is a good master
and I'm not your playmate.

Polish my shoes first.

Jeez, what you are proud.
In some ways and not in others.

Pour a drink for us.
A strong - a midsommarnattssup.

I'll empty the glass in one gulp.

Thank you, John. IT'S SO KIND OF YOU.

Have you ever been in love?

We do not use that word,
but I have enjoyed many girls.

One time when I did not get a girl
I wanted, I became ill.

Seriously ill, as a prince in a Fairy tale

who can not eat or drink
because of love.

Who was it?

It was you.

Do you know what the world looks
from my site? No, you do not.

You are like hawks and falcons
hovering high in the sky.

Their backs are seldom seen,
for just hovers there.

Come.

Come with me.

Do you see?

It's like
to have their own secret world.

Tell me about your home.

There must be a limitless accident
to be poor.

Oh, Miss Julie...

A dog can lie
in a countess sofa.

A horse can get cloudy caressed
of a young lady's hand

but A farmhand...

Yes, yes...

My home...

There is a koja-

far out there in the gray wasteland
where there is growing a single tree.

You can not see it from here,
not even from the top. It is hidden.

Sometimes that boy
I was drawn to ensure your castle.

Era gardens.

When I got close enough
I saw the wall around your park.

In the evenings I climbed
on the wall to see your home.

It was much more beautiful than the church.

I had never been inside it-

But my thoughts than was later
in life so they returned always there.

I'm sitting on the wall,
shaded by trees and covered with kaprifol-

I saw people come and go
as if they were kings and emperors.

And I knew that the world
would never be mine.

And then one day...

I saw a pink dress
and a pair of white socks.

I saw you - go around among the lilies.

Yes... I fell in love.

I wanted to talk to you. I wanted...

touch you.

And I tÃ¤nkte-

That if a thief can now enter
in heaven and be with Ã¤nglarna-

why can not a country boy
I be in the Baron's garden-

-and playing with his daughter?

Next Sunday I washed myself
with soap and hot water

put on my best clothes and went
to the church, where I got to see you again.

I saw you.
Yes, Miss Julie, I saw you.

And I went home
determined to die.

But I wanted to die beautifully
and peaceful, but someone pain.

Then I remembered that it is dangerous
sleeping under an elderberry bush.

And I knew if a large,
in full bloom.

I picked all the flowers
and prepared a bed of oat coffin.

I lay down
and pulled the cover over me...

and closed my eyes.

I fell asleep on the toxic flÃ¤derblommorna-

and woke
as a very sick boy.

But I did not die, as you see.

And I knew
I never could get you.

You're all that I can never get.

You speak as...

that I read in my books.

Have you gone to school?
Not much.

But I have read a lot
and gone on theater

and I have listened
at finer folks call.

I try even
to speak like them.

Do you listen to what we say?
Yes, and I've heard a lot.

When I drove the cart for you or
rowed the boat to you and your friend.

What? Tell us.
It would not be easy to repeat.

I was surprised. I did not understand
where you could have taught you such words.

Maybe it's not such a big difference
on people who you think.

May I go to bed now?
Go to bed at midsummer night?

Dancing with the mob out there
attracts me.

Good night, Miss Julie. Sleep well.

Download boat and row me out on the lake.
I want to look at the sun.

Would it be wise?
Do you fear for your reputation?

I do not want to be ridiculed
and discharged without recommendation.

Maybe I owe Kathleen something.
Are you afraid of Kathleen?

Go to bed.
You command me now?

Yes, for once
and for your own sake.

The night is far screed. You have
drunk and do not know what you do.

They come to look for me.
I may not be found here with you.

I love them and they love me.
Let them come, you'll see.

No, Miss Julie,
they do not like you.

They take your food and your money
and spits after you.

Why? I have never hurt them.
The mob is always a coward.

They are falskhjÃ¤rtade.

In these kinds of situations,
one can only flee. We flees.

Where to? To my room?
No, to my.

We are safe there.
I'll take care of you.

If they're there?
I joists door.

If they hit it then?
I shoot.

Come. Come on!

Do you promise to...
I promise!

I do not know who I am.

I do not know who you are.

It does not know me either.

Do not you know who I am?
Did you say that?

No.

No, what?

Come away.

Your hand in mine.

That I did not tell you.

Then when I saw you in the garden.

I sat for hours on the wall and
looked at the house until the sun went down.

And then...
You may despise me now-

but I did it
I had never dared to do.

I jumped down the other side.

In the hope that you would come out again
so I got to talk to you.

I do not know what I was thinking, but
knew I did not belong there.

I was very afraid, Miss Julie.

I knew who I was.

A boy who found his brother
starved in sÃ¤ngen-

And my father told me
never to tease his grace.

What kind baron had been against us.

I must leave you garden. The
was forbidden and father would be angry.

Then I saw someone coming.

It was the Baron.

My heart was pounding.

I rushed through the raspberry thicket.

Thorns tore me
and the thorns stuck in my feet.

A week later I saw you again.

You went round among the roses.
In such deep thoughts.

You looked so lonely, even unhappy.

You did not see me.

I wish that you had done it.

Please do. I beg you.

Forgive me. Forgive me.

You do not understand.

I'm sorry, please forgive me.

I can not stay here anymore.

Stay in the room until I've
ensured that Kathleen did not see you.

Kathleen, please.

Please Kathleen.

Please, stay here.

Just a little while. Stop here.

There are things
I have no control now.

I can not control the Miss Julie.

No, do not talk.
Wait. I'll talk.

I come back, I promise.

Stay in here now, Kathleen.
For me.

And for us.

Try to sleep.

Please, you need to sleep.

Kathleen might have heard us.

I think she knows.

What should we do?
John, what should we do?

We?

We...

We have done what everyone is doing.
It's midsummer night, Miss Julie.

Between midnight and dawn may
loving open hearts and countries.

Listen, we... we can accommodate.
Travel - far from here.

Travel?
Far away. To Switzerland.

For the Italian lakes. Lake Como.
I have been there. There I said before.

Life has given us an answer. It is
a miracle. I have a picture here.

That's life.
Always new faces.

Never a moment of worry, no need
wondering what to get to.

People dancing day and night,
trains visslar-

and all the time guldmynts jingles.
That's life, Julie.

Eternal summer. Orange trees. Laurel tree.

I open a first class hotel with first class
guests.

A hotel?
Yes, it will be our life.

You will be the hotel's decoration. With
your appearance and your style is given.

You will never be alone again.
I'll take care of you.

I promise. Freedom.
No more walls or gardens.

You will sit there like a queen
and control the slaves with a clock.

Guests defilerar beyond your belief
and leave their offerings.

People will tremble
when they hold out a bills

and you humor them
with your beautiful smile.

One day I'm as rich as your father.
I might even buy him out.

Say that you love me.
Otherwise, I am nothing.

Not now, not here. Absolutely no
feelings, because then all is lost.

Cold Blood, clear heads,
adults.

We sit at the table. You there.

I'm sitting here and we'll talk
as if nothing had happened between us.

Have you no feelings at all?
No one is more emotional than I am.

For a little while ago, you held me.
I lay in your bed...

Now we have other things to think about.
Do not speak unkindly to me!

We have made a mistake, a big one.
It would be foolish to do another one.

Before the Baron will
I need to know: do you believe in me?

How do we do all this?
We have no money.

It's true.

I want you to become my partner.
I need your money.

I have no money.
I own nothing himself.

That settles it.

Do you think I'll stay in this house
which your woman?

Do you think I let people touch
finger at me and laugh at me?

That I can see my father in the eye?
What have I done?

Do not bother with it.
Turn off the fountain!

Do you even know what love is?
I?! That God knows.

Do you think it's my first time?
Now you despise me.

Do not pretend to be nervous
and does not pretend to be special.

We are equals now.

Look here, my little friend.

Let me invite you
in a glass with something extra nice.

Where did you find this?
In the basement.

My father's wine?

Is not good enough for his son in law?

Thief.
Are you going to tell on me? Yes, bowl.

I am so unhappy.
Why?

Think of Kathleen. I got
forbid her to go to the kitchen.

Do not you think she has feelings?
Downstairs is downstairs.

And a whore is a whore!

Oh my god, I'm so scared!

I'm in a dark hole
and it feels like I'm falling.

You're sick, young lady.

I really feel sorry for you.

When I was a little boy and surreptitiously
looked at you in trÃ¤dgÃ¥rden-

and saw you walking around amongst the roses
with your narrow white ankles...

I had the same dirty thoughts
like all young boys.

You said you wanted to die for me.
It was a lie.

It's nice talk that gets women
to spread your legs!

Wretch!
You may carry one.

Now you have seen HÃ¶kens back.
Not its back.

How can a soul be so dirty?
Wash it then!

Your lackey!
Stand up when I speak with you!

Stand up when I speak with you!
Lackey? Tig, Miss whore!

Shut up and get out of here!
You have no right to be here!

Kathleen do not like
when your kind visit her kitchen.

Had she been as vulgar as you
throwing you over a man?

Where do you think you are? In a zoo?
In a horhus?

Yes, I'm crap - I am nothing.
I do not belong here, I know.

But please, help me, John.

I have to find a way out of this.

Please help me
to find a way out of this.

I could be part of the debt,
but do you think that I-

would even dare to look at as you
if you had not begged for it?

Please.
I'm still taken aback.

Though the victory was too easy res
to be exciting.

Stop.

I'm sorry I said it.
I do not want to turn on an unarmed.

I can not deny
that I was delighted to upptÃ¤cka-

that what has dazzled us
subdue it just was gaudiness.

That you have powder on your sore cheek.

And the dirt under your nails smustiga.

That your perfumed handkerchief
is dirty, Julie.

But it hurts me to realize
that I longed since

is so far from true.
It's nothing, it's worthless.

Sad that you have sunk so low,
Julie, much lower than you cook.

It makes as much pain
like to see autumn's last flowers-

keep up with your head, wilted or
ragged by rain and made of dirt.

You speak as if you are
already standing over me.

I conceived of a baron.
You can never achieve it.

It's true. But I can
beget a baron - with your help.

You are a thief - that's not me.
There are much worse things.

Anyway, I serve in an RV

and look like one of the family,
as a child in the house.

It's not theft if a child
taking a berry from a large cluster.

Miss Julie.

Miss Julie?

You are a wonderful woman
and too fine for one like me.

You've been drinking and lost his head
and try to hide your mistake,

by to tell you
that you love me.

If my outer attracted you
so is your love is not better than mine.

I can be like your dog that you
show love when it suits re-

but it's not enough for me.
I will make you never love me.

Are you so sure?

Do you mean that it can be possible?

And I can fall in love with you?

Yes, I can.

You are beautiful. You are elegant.
I love that in a woman.

Ni is formed.
We could read together.

All the great writers.
We could discuss them.

The fire that you teeth in a man
does not go out.

Your kisses are as strong spices.
Leave me alone!

You are disgusting - like a rat.

I hate you.

Hold me then.

Yes, we can accommodate.

Are you my friend?
I am sometimes.

But do not trust me.

I need you to understand me, look at me.

Do not give me your life's secrets.

You will regret it.

You sound like my mother.

She was so beautiful.

Look at this picture of her.

She would not be a mother.

She smiled at me,
but did not mean it.

Sometimes when I think of her smile
so my mouth.

But I do not smile inside.

Do not drink more.

It's as if I was cut off
from all that is life.

Inside Me...

inside me - nothing.

A black hole.

She taught me...

to distrust and hate all men.

And I promised her
as ten-year GIRLS

-that I never ever-

Could be a slave to a man.

I did not even understand what it meant.

When do you hate me too.
Yes.

I'd like to shoot you
like a dog.

Without doubts?

Without scruples.

But you have nothing to shoot me with.

And I'm no dog.

I'll bring you up to my room.

Then I put you in my birdcage.

Most of all, I would die.

Die? It's stupid.

Shore of Lake Como.
You said that the sun always shines.

Look at the wall out there.

It's the only thing you see from here.

You can just feel the sunlight.

And one can only hear the wind.

On the other side of the wall
I have a place.

A secret garden.

It blows no wind there.

I go there when I'm anxious.

I'm anxious all the time.

I always long
to another location.

You can not imagine how different
I wished that my life would be.

When I was little,
just after Mom died...

I was hoping
that my whole garden...

would be full of animals.

They would come from...

I do not know where they'd come from.

They would be there...

to watch over me.

I have a hole in my stomach.

I do not know
was my sadness comes from.

And now you...

You and me.

Yes, we have to travel.

To make each other's lives
hell?

No... to be happy.

And smile inwardly.

Entertain us for a few years,
as long as we can.

And then...

die.

Do you want to die with me?

I do not want to die.
I enjoy life.

Do you refuse to die with me?
I'm sorry, Miss Julie.

Say no more.
I go to bed.

You disgraced me.
You owe me anything.

Here... Thank you.

Is this my reward for opening my
heart and donate my Atts honor?

I warned you.
You forced me.

You were seductress.

We can get married
and then we can separate us.

I humiliate me.
Demeans?

I so wish that it was undone.
And if you only loved me!

I told you not to drink,
for when you speak. You shall not speak.

A butterfly die during lovemaking.
I wish I did.

What do you want?
Should I cry with you again?

Should I kiss your feet again? What?

I've had enough, Miss Julie.

This hurts.

Miss Julie,
I see that you are unhappy.

Yes, you suffer, but...

I do not understand what you are saying.

My Kind behave not like you.

We hate and destroy not one another.
We love for fun.

It's a game we play
when we are off from work.

But we have not got all day
and the night that your kind have.

You know what?

I think you're sick.
Yes, I'm sure you're sick.

Be kind to me, John.
Speak to me as a human being.

Each time a man himself.

You spit on me, but will not let me
wipe it on you.

Help me then.
Tell me what to do.

If I only knew it yourself!
I know.

I have behaved dissolute
like I'm crazy. I know.

But now... What do I do?

Stay here and keep quiet.
No one knows.

I can not stay here. Everyone knows.
They do not know and never think about it.

But suppose that there are consequences.

Consequences?

Since there is only one thing to do.
You must disappear, travel immediately.

And you must travel alone.

Alone? Where to? I can not.
You must!

Before the Baron will.
If you stay, you know what happens.

Write late to your father about your accident.
He loves you and will help you.

He never guess it was me.
He may not want to know.

I travel if you follow through.
Are you crazy?!

Miss Julie elope with a valet?

It had been in the papers
and the baron never survive.

I'm so tired.

I'm so... incredibly tired.

Commit me.

I have to be told.

I can no longer imagine.
I can not move.

Do you now-

-who helpless creatures your kind are?

Why you strutting around
with his nose in luften-

As if you were lords of creation?

I'll tell you what to do.

I shall command you.

Go to your father's library.

In his desk drawer, there is money.
Take the money.

Come with me up.

Go!

Go up there!

Speak kindly to me.
Commandments always sounds unfriendly.

Now you know how it feels. Go.

Can I leave my room now?

You look terrible.

May God forgive you.
What have you done?

You are my woman.

But the night is long, Kathleen.

All wines...

My head was not with me,
I was dizzy.

I asked what you have done.

I have so much pain, Kathleen.
Let us hold each other.

No. No!

I have this clear to you.

To the Church.

You always have my things.

Thank you. Thank you.

You promised to accompany me today.

That's right, I remember now.

And here you are with my Sunday best.

Take me them then.

What is today's text?
John the Baptist's beheading.

You strangles me!

God, I'm so tired. So tired.

I'm exhausted.

Why did you stay up all night
then?

Have you seen your face?

Miss Julie...
She did not leave me.

Stop. And she does not know what
to suit themselves, she does not.

She talked.
She needed to talk.

You know how I am.

I always put a veil over people.

I glorify them.

So I never see
who they really are.

I did it with Miss Julie-

and I had
to be disappointed.

We forced all see ourselves
less than we had hoped.

Is not it strange
when you think about it? Hon.

What is strange?

Everything.

Look me straight in the eye.

Yes.

Is it possible?

Is it possible?

Yes... that's it.

It's horrible!
I can tear your eyes out!

Yes, I feel for it!
It's filthy, absolutely disgusting!

Are you mad at her?
No, I'm mad at you!

It really was shoddily done!
Poor young woman.

I have to respect my mistress.

Are you jealous of her?
No, not at her.

If it had been Clara or Sophie
I would have been jealous.

I do not work in a house where people
can not behave decently.

Had you done that? You pulled down
yourself in the dirt by doing it.

Get out of here! Out!

Get out of here!
Why should you respect them?

Do not you know that?
If you think you're so clever.

It shows that they are not better than us.

Then nothing can inspire us to
themselves to get better.

Did you think about the Baron?
Think of all the sorrows he had in life.

I'm not staying here longer
and forced to look him in the eyes.

And with you.
Why did she do it with you?

If at least it had been with
a man of her kind, a better man.

She wanted to give the dog poison to
it ran after the Forester's rubbish.

You are good to be who you are,
but there is a difference. Class is class.

I'm not staying here any longer.

On October 14 we travel.
You should also be included.

You can find work as a porter
or bid at eachother authority.

The pay is lower, but it is safe. Your
widow and your children receive a pension.

Should I plan my death
so you can get a pension?

I have better prospects than
them in mind.

Who goes around up there?

Could it be the baron?
Already?

Listen.

If I travel, I never
a job like this.

Why should you go?

You have not seen much of the world.
Why should you go?

When the baron traveling 14 October
so will we.

We have known each other for a few years.
Do not forget your obligations.

Let's hope
to the Baron never know-

what happened here in his betjÃ¤nts
place this midsummer night.

Go straight to you. He should not
come home and see you like this.

I go out with the dog
and when I come back-

can you and I to church
and you ask God to forgive you.

And I ask Him to help us.
All of us.

Oh my God. As you look.

What? How do I look?

You are deathly pale.

The sun is coming up.
And the trolls dancing.

Yes, they have danced all night.

I have the money.

How much?
I took the whole thing.

Please, come with me.
I can not travel alone.

Not today.
On Midsummer Day trains are overcrowded.

I can not travel exclusive.

Amid all the black
and gray on the train.

When people look at me as if they knew.

It's so beautiful out there.

Garden.

I showed you never
my little brook, huh?

I know you had loved it.
All my flowers.

Miss Julie.

I'm coming with you,
but it must become at once.

What is that?

What is it?

It's my canary.
Do you take with you a cage?

I'm leaving her.
Release the cage!

It's the only thing that I take.

Release the cage, I say!

Kathleen will at any time.

Listen.
You go out through the main entrance.

I take the servants' door.
See you out there at the gate.

Release the bird. Now!
Kathleen takes care of it.

No, my little bird,
he takes you.

No.
The bird, the bird!

Give me that!

My little bird, he takes you.

For God's sake. Quiet! Quiet!

Kill me too. Kill me.

You kill an innocent animal
without blinking.

I hate and despise you.

There is blood between us.

I curse the moment when I saw you.

I curse the day I was born.

Kill me too.

Do you think I can not bear to see blood?

Do you think I'm weak?

I would like to see your blood,
your brain lying there on the table!

See all your sex swimming in blood
as my little bird!

You think I'm weak!

You think I love you
my womb longed for your seed.

Do you think I want to wear
your brood over my heart

close it with my blood
and give it your name?

What is your name really?

John - and then?
What is your surname?

You may not have anything.
I am wife riding instructor, wife dung-heap.

You dog wearing my necklace!
You laborer wearing my owner's mark.

Share yourself with Kathleen,
my own kokerska-

and all other needy women
working here.

You think I'm a coward and wants to escape.

No, I'll stay
and allows the flash knock down.

My father comes home.

He finds his desk fractured
and his money away.

When he rings the bell twice
on his man and summons polisen-

, and I tell them everything.

It'll be nice
to put an end to it.

Then get my father a stroke
and doors

and it will be the end of us all.

And everything becomes quiet,
peaceful, eternal rest.

Baron's family goes out and Butler
dynasty continues in an orphanage.

Now speak royal blood.

Ports in the gutter
and die in prison.

Bravo, Miss Julie.
Ensure that the valet knows its location.

What is happening?

What a mess you have caused.

You are a woman, Kathleen.

You are my friend.

You have to understand me.

You must listen to me.

I want to know nothing of you,
Miss Julie. What is happening?

What? What?

Kathleen, you have to understand me.
I do not understand.

You must listen to me.

If you wish that John will go away
with you, I have to stop you both.

Tig, Kathleen, and listen to me.
I can not stay here.

John can not stay here.
We must leave here.

Huh?
Wait! I have an idea.

We can all three...

travel together abroad
and start a hotel.

I have money - look.

John and I can stand for increasingly

and you can take care of the kitchen.
Would not it be good?

Please tell me yes, Kathleen.
Come with us.

You must see the world.

You can not imagine
how fun it is to ride on the train.

We just talked about it.
You will love it.

Train whistles, vehicles stop.

Watches Rings - upstairs,
downstairs.

You should stand... no, you should sit
in the kitchen like a queen.

Course, you should not
stand at the stove itself.

With all the nice clothes that you wear
to greet the guests.

You are so beautiful, Kathleen.
I flatter you.

You'll find a husband. A rich Englishman.
They are so easy to catch.

And we become rich.
We build a villa on Lake Como.

It's raining there.

A little... a little.

Sometimes.

But the sun will shine at times.

Although it looks dark.

And...

then...

Or we can go home again.

Come back here or...

elsewhere.

Think Miss Julie herself on this?

If I believe in it yourself?
Yes.

I do not know.

I do not know anything anymore.

Nothing. Nothing at all.

So you thought accommodate?

Escaping? It is too much to say.

You heard the lady. Maybe she's tired
after having been up all night-

But it's a plan that can engage.

You mean I should become a cook,
for her? Her?

Talk more gracefully when you speak
before your mistress. Do you understand?

Oh my God, listen to you.

It would be better for you to listen
bit more and talk less.

She's your mistress.

If you despise her for what she has done
, you despise yourself.

I always thought I myself.
And looked down on others.

I have never done anything
in my position.

The Baron's cook has never been
with renowned author and swine farm hand.

That's right, you had me.
It was very lucky for you.

Lucky? A man who steals from the baron?

Are you going to say.

You who can not even respect
your own mistress anymore.

John.

Are you coming to church with me?
You would need a good sermon.

No.

I'm not going to church today.

Walk alone and confess your sins.

Yes. I'll do that.

And come home with forgiveness
so it is enough for you too.

Jesus suffered and died on the cross
for us.

If we go to him with open heart
so he takes upon himself our sins.

Do you really think about it, Kathleen?

I have believed in it all my life.

Why I stand here now
with my childhood faith.

"Where sin abounds,
which abounds grace more."

Oh, if only I had your faith.

It is not given to everyone
without God's special grace.

Everyone deserves not.

Who provided it then?

Only God knows that.

It is a nÃ¥daverk, Miss Julie.

God has no partiality Personen-

but where will they last
to be the main.

As he helps the outermost then?

And it is easier for a camel
to go through a nÃ¥lsÃ¶ga-

than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven.

So it's just, Miss Julie.

Well then...

I go - alone.

When I go past the stableboy
should I say to him-

-that does not emit hÃ¤starna-

If anyone would like to travel
before the baron comes home.

Goodbye.

What would you do in my place?
In your place?

Let me see...

As vÃ¤lboren, as a woman...

After such a mistake,
as one who has fallen...

I do not know.

Jo.

I know.

This?
Yes.

But I would not do it.

I would not.

Do you understand?

There is a difference between us.

There is the same difference
as between man and woman.

That's about a rich person
not going to heaven is a lie, huh?

Baron is back.
God, what if Kathleen...

He has seen his desk.

Yes, John, your grace.

Yes, Your Honor.

Instantly.

About half an hour, your grace.

Yes, yes, about half an hour.

He called for his boots.
He wants to have coffee for half an hour.

Half an hour.

I'm exhausted.
I do not know what to do.

Fly, stay, live...

die.

You know what I want to do, but
I do not know how I'll do it.

Force me.

Commit me.
I obey you like a dog.

I can not.

I do not know why.

It's like the
I wear this coat.

I can not command you.

I heard the Baron's voice just now.

I can not explain it.

God, it's the damn farmhand
sitting on my back.

I do as I'm told.

If the Baron came down here now and
told me to cut my throat...

I would have done it in place.

Pretend when you are he.

And pretend I'm you.

Have you seen a magician at the theater?

The Wizard says:
"Do everything I tell you."

And she does as she is told.

He says... "take the broom."

And she takes it.

He says "sweep" and she sweeps.

I see silver and gold
and all the stars.

Like when I went to sleep as a child.

I float out the window
and up to the sky.

Such freedom,
surrounded by sparkling crystals.

And the darkness is no longer dark.

The entire room is warm and safe
as an open fire.

It's you.

And I'm close to the fire.

So nice and warm it is.

And it's so quiet.

And so brightly.

Here is the broom.

Go to the barn.

Use.

Go now while it is bright.

Go through the tunnel
lest you meet your father.

Thank you.

Say that the main
also can receive the gift of grace.

Say it, even if you do not believe it.
The premier?

No, I can not do it.

But wait...

Miss Julie, now I know.

You're no longer
among the best.

You are among the most extreme.

I am one of the ultimate.

And the main
school can be the ultimate.

Do not speak, do not think. Do not think.

Go, Miss Julie.
There is no other way.

Go.

Wait!

<i>I'm sending you out in the world.</i>

<i>Watch.
You're like colorful stars.</i>

<i>The water is your heaven.</i>

<i>Do you know it, my flowers?</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

<i>Everything is so much greater than
the small portions.</i>

<i>Do you know that?</i>
