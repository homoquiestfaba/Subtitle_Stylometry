JAPANESE HORROR ANTHOLOGY -
HORROR OF TRUTH -

Is the world in front of you
presently a world of reality?

If someone asks you such a
question, you may laugh.

But there may be ones who lost
their confidence for a moment.

Yes, it is not you.

The one beside you...

MORTUARY

Sorry... I was unable to help you.

You're still a medical student.
Take it easy.

It's unbelievable that
he wasn't killed instantly.

Doctor! Please go to
operation room number two.

Sure.

Hey, trainee!

To the mortuary.

What? To the mortuary?

Wait until his family arrives.
But, l...

Take this too.

But...

Get aside.

The corpse spoke!

That's sound of gas in his chest.

What? A gas?

That happens. Now go back.

We have a critical patient.

I sympathize with you
in your great grief indeed.

Umm... please let me explain.

Take a seat, if you will.

In this case,
at the time of collision,

most of his organs were ruptured...

Doctor.

My son...

What is it?

My son is still alive.

What?

He is still alive.

No... but...

Sorry. Perhaps there was
some kind of confusion.

Do you know the name
of the nurse who's in charge?

I guess not.

Will you tell me your name?

I'm Yamada.

Thank you.

Please answer!

Where have you been, Makoto?
I have been looking for you.

Who are you talking to?

It was his birthday present.

You're going to become
a car racer, right?

We're going to the park
with his car tomorrow.

Right, Makoto?

Mrs. Yamada... are you alright?

Say hello to the doctor, Makoto.

Makoto, you should not
sleep in such a place.

You give too much trouble.

Mrs. Yamada.

Excuse me, doctor.
I will wake him up now.

Makoto, Makoto.

Makoto, wake up, Makoto.

Mrs. Yamada, that boy has...

Yes?

That boy has already... deceased.

A few moments ago,

he has passed away.

Doctor, he is just sleeping.

Makoto, Makoto, wake up.

There's no pulse.

Do not lose your mind.

Makoto, Makoto, wake up,
let's go back.

Makoto, Makoto, wake up.

Yes?

Doctor?

Just a moment.

What's the matter with him?

What?

<i>The patient is deceased,</i>
<i>so take the body there...</i>

What? The boy's body is here.

<i>They're mother and child.</i>

What? Mother and child?

<i>She's dead. They were both</i>
<i>involved in an accident.</i>

<i>She is his Mother.</i>

Mother?

Doctor?

No... his Mother is here.

<i>What are you saying!</i>

Doctor! My boy...

Mother?

Please save my boy quickly.

Please save my boy.

Who are...

What are you?

Quickly!

Quickly!

You don't have to care about me.

Help...

my boy quickly.

Help...

my boy quickly.

Help...

Makoto quickly.

Quickly.

Please don't run away, doctor.

Help my boy quickly.

I was unable to do a thing.

Nothing but to look.

Nothing but to look.

Doctor.

It was too late for treatment.

Don't come, don't... don't.

<i>Hey, trainee!</i>

Hey, trainee!

I called you.
Why didn't you come?

Now stand up!
We're going back again.

If you're like that, you won't
be able to manage this job.

Mother.

This multicolored world
we call our world.

I'm staying here,
want to stay here,

and wanted to stay here.

At the moment you accept
your inevitable destiny,

you'll just find the bright
white world spreading.

And eventually as you
regain your eyesight,

what will you see?
