<i> â™ª </i>

[Device beeps]

Oh, hey.
Oh!

Good morning, Ms. Green.
Well, happy holidays, Eric.

I am just headed out.

You can put everything
through the slot.

I'm...actually,
I'm glad I ran into you.

I actually need
a signature for this.

Oh, okay.
So who's this one from?

Uh, the great American
food company.

Oh. My granddaughter.

She's in the food business?

No, no, but it's
the same every year.

No note, no card,
just fruit in a box.

My wife loves fruit baskets.

Well, then you keep it.

It'll only collect
clutter here.

Oh, Ms. Green, I can't.

This...it's against
company policies.

[Sighs]

Well, then I decline it.


Merry Christmas, Eric.


<i> [Upbeat festive music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Hey, y'all.

<i> â™ª </i>

Morning, Paul.

<i> [Soft music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

<i> - I am so glad</i>

we got to see each other
in person.

What brings you
to New York anyway?

I'm on my way
to the Virgin Islands

for a little me time.

My flight leaves later today.

Mm, a well-earned vacation.

You did an excellent job
in London.

Everyone is thrilled
with the new initiatives.

They feel like the company

is finally heading
in the right direction.

Well, that's what happens
when you let the i's have it.

Identify the problem,
implement changes as needed

to improve and strengthen
for maximum effectiveness.

So what's my next assignment?

Uh, I have some ideas.

Is it that French
cookware company?

Please tell me I get to spend
the winter in Paris.

It is the most beautiful
and most romantic

during that time of year.

Well, that's one option,
but you've done such great work

all over the world
for almost five years.

We were thinking
of another position.

One that would keep you here.

What is it?

How does vice president
for North America sound?

Fantastic...

In theory.

Okay, talk to me.

I thought you'd be thrilled.

Don't get me wrong, right?

'Cause I...I appreciate
the recognition.

It's just, um, I can't see
myself in New York right now.

But isn't your whole
family here?

Harlem, yeah.

Oh, no, no, look,
I...I love my family.

I really, really love
my family.

It's...it's just...Complicated.

Hmm.

Is that why you're flying
to the Caribbean for Christmas

instead of just taking
the a train home?

No.

No. No! You know what?

I'm not gonna feel guilty
about this,

'cause my dad's out of town,

my mom is on a trip
with her friends,

and I've already sent
everyone their presents.

In fact, my grandmother

mama belle's gift
should be arriving now.

I'm sorry, what?

<i> [Quirky music]</i>


Just a minute.

<i> â™ª </i>

[Groans]

Well, I hate
to break it to you,

but my arms can't take
much more of this.

Is that what you said
to your drill sergeant, Caleb?

In the Navy,
we call them rdcs,

recruit division commanders...
[Phone buzzing]

And trust me,
they have nothing on you.

Okay.
Is everything okay?

Everything's lovely.

Let's go with white lights.

No, I mean, there's someone
trying to get hold of you.

[Phone buzzing]
Oh, I didn't notice.

Um, on second thought,
let's keep the colored lights.

[Phone buzzing]

Hello?

Mama belle,
is everything all right?

Everything is fine, dear.
How are you?

I...i sent you a gift.

That's nice.
<i> - [Chuckles]</i>

Well, I just got a notice
from the post office

that said
you declined the package.

Well, that's right, Jazmin.

I did not accept your package.

I'm pretty sure
that you know why.

Presence over presents.

I do not want any more
dried fruit baskets.

I want to see you.

I wanna see you, too,

but you know
how much I travel for work.

And I just got back
from London,

<i> and I'm trying to...</i>
Back?

What do you mean, "back"?

Are you in New York?

Y-Yes,

but, um, Iâ€™m...
I'm only here for a few hours.

I'm catching another flight.

Today is the first day
of Christmas jamboree,

you are in New York,

and you weren't planning
on coming home?

No, of...Of course I was,
mama belle.

Of course, I was...
I was actually

<i> about to get on the train</i>

and come surprise you,
but so much for that.

Great, I am leading
yuletide yoga at the Wyatt 11.

Yoga?
Yuletide yoga.

So wear something festive.

<i> I can't wait to see you,</i>
<i> baby girl.</i>

Bye.

What exactly is going on?

Christmas jamboree.

Think 12 days of Christmas
streamlined into 7

with family, music,
cultural events,

all under
a red and green rainbow.

Today's day one.

Mm, that sounds like fun.

[Laughs]
Yeah, sounds like a headache

I don't need before
my flight leaves tonight.

Mm-hmm.

So that was Jazmin?

It was.
How's she doing?

She's fine. Restless.

That's how
she's always been.

Well, she just needs
a reason to stand still.

Well...

Nobody can get Jazmin
to stand still.

Oh, I don't know.

I have a few ideas.

Uncle Caleb!
Uncle Caleb!

What's up?

[Laughing]
Mm.

Well, now, can mama belle
get some of that hug?


Did my brother actually
hang Christmas lights?

He has been so helpful
with jamboree this year

that I promised I would come
and help him decorate.

More like insisted.
Well, it's a start,

but I think
we need a tree, yeah?

You know what, why don't I
pick up a tree later

and maybe we can all
decorate it?

Love that, and now I have
to go get dressed

for yuletide yoga.

See everyone tonight.

Bye.
See ya.

See you later.

Caleb, thank you so much.

I know the last thing
these guys wanna do

is spend an hour
in the doctor's office.

Kwame is waiting in the car.
I'm out.

Good luck.
Thank you.

Oh!
[Laughs]

<i> [Upbeat music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Huh.

"Wear something festive."

Hi.

<i> [Upbeat music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Now come stand right here.

Now cover up your eyes.
Count to ten.

Both: One, two...

Come on, now.
I cannot hear you.

Both: Three, four, five,

six, seven, eight,

nine, ten.

All right, let me know
when you find your present.

<i> [Soft music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Uncle Caleb, we found it.

Hold up.
How did you find it so fast?

She told me.

<i> â™ª </i>

You know her?
Yeah, yeah.

This is mama belle's
granddaughter.

Hi.
Hey, this is Jazmin Carter.

We grew up together.

We were actually
best friends.

I guess we were.

Mm-hmm.

Uh, Jazmin,
these are Katrina's kids.

This is Eli, and this is Jay.

Hey, nice to meet you two.

Same.

Hey, will you both go grab
a couple of drinks?

I'll be right up there.

Thank you.
Bye.

So when'd you get back?

A couple of years ago.

Once deployment was over,

home was the only place
I wanted to be.

You look good.
Yeah, so do you.

Someone's in
the Christmas spirit, I see.

Yeah, yeah, I am...

I am actually on my way
to yuletide yoga.

Okay.
And then I catch a flight.

Right, right.

Well, safe travels,
wherever you're headed.

Hmm, thanks.

And hey, it was...
It was really good to see you.

You too.
Take care.

Likewise.

Merry Christmas.

Thanks.

<i> â™ª </i>

<i> [Soft music]</i>

Okay. Get that.

<i> [Playful music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Two, three...There.

All right, everyone,
just warm up a little bit more,

and then we're gonna
get started very shortly.

<i> â™ª </i>

Ahh! [Laughs]

Oh, baby girl.

Hi, mama belle.
Oh!

Oh, everyone,
I am pleased to say

that my beautiful
granddaughter

has stopped globetrotting

long enough
to attend today's class.

Hi.

And all it took
was sending back a package.

Wait, is that the one she's
always showing pictures of?

Geneva, Tokyo, you name it.

So put your things
down there.

That's your mat,
and we're gonna get started.

But mama, I have to warn you.

I haven't done a lot of yoga.

It's okay.

Today is the perfect time
for you to start to bring

a little balance
into your life.

All right, everyone,
down on your mats,

cross-legged in whatever
comfortable position you have,

and you're gonna stack
your spine,

soften your shoulders,
close your eyes,

go into prayer pose,
hands together.

And as you take
a few measured breaths,

just remember that yoga
means union and balance.

It's the opportunity to bring
all things into alignment.

Take that last breath,
come to standing,

and we're going to go
into dancer's pose.

You know what that is.
I'll come around and help you.

It's not prancer,

comet, cupid or blitzen,
but dancer's pose.

Okay, baby, bring that
left leg heel to your buttock.

Yeah.
You're gonna grab

your left ankle...
Okay.

And bring it
towards your...This knee.

Just...oh!
No, no!

Ahh!
No!

<i> [Playful music]</i>

Are you okay?
I'm all right.

What did the doctor say?
Torn Achilles.

Have to stay off of it
for about six weeks.

Okay, wh...What
do you need me to do?

Call Caleb and tell him
that we're on our way.

On our way?
On our way where?

To the street lighting
ceremony.

The official kickoff
of jamboree.

It starts at 6:00,
and I can't be late.

Mama, stop.

Maybe you should skip it
and you should just rest.

I have not missed
street lighting in 50 years,

and I'm not about
to start tonight.

Resting would be best.
Right.

Oh, Caleb,
thank goodness, baby.

Well, word travels fast,

especially when it's
about mama belle.

Are you okay?
I'm fine.

I want you all
to stop asking me that.

I have a jamboree to plan.

Are you coming, or are you
going to the airport?

Yes, hold on!

<i> [Upbeat festive music]</i>

Just need her coat
and jacket and bag.

I hate to ask
the obvious, mama,

but now that you're on
the injured reserve list,

who's gonna take over
the jamboree?

It's a lot of setup at a lot
of different locations.

Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

I can go anywhere.

<i> [Solemn music]</i>

Hey, mama.

I am so sorry.

I feel horrible about all this.

I told you it's all right.

You can't even walk
up the stairs by yourself.

Don't you have
a flight to catch?

All right, well,
thank you, everybody.

I...I'm so grateful
for all of your kind thoughts.

You know, Christmas jamboree
is special to this community.

It has been our holiday
institution for many years,

but this year, honestly,

I...i don't know if I'm gonna
be able to pull it off.

This injury,
Iâ€™m...I'm just not sure

if I'll be able to pull all
the pieces together in time.

Both: But...

But...[laughs] Hi.

But...excuse me, just...

Um, you don't
have to worry about that,

because I am staying to help.

I will be chairing this year's
Christmas jamboree.

[Cheers and applause]

Uh-huh.

One moment, please.

Jazmin, you don't know
the first thing about jamboree.

You haven't been to one
in years.

Doesn't matter.

This is what I do.
I'm a fixer.

I go into companies that
are usually in a free fall,

and I fix them.

That sounds great
for the corporate world,

but what exactly does it have
to do with Christmas jamboree?

What are you doing?

I am canceling my flight.

Okay.
It's done.

You want to help?

You do it with Caleb.

You might have
organizational savvy,

but he knows the heartbeat
of this community.

So you two are now co-chairs

of this year's
Christmas jamboree.

Work it out together.

Well, everybody...

So we might be down,
but we are not out.

We will have
a great Christmas jamboree,

because we always do, right?

Okay!

So let's turn on the lights.

Okay, Caleb.

Ready?

All: One. Two. Three.

Lights!

[Crowd gasping]


Just great.

<i> â™ª </i>

<i> [Soft music]</i>

Okay, let me just...
One second.

Let me get this off here.
All right.

You get settled.


Whoa.

Mama belle's at Christmas.

This brings back
a lot of memories.

Good ones, I hope.

Yeah, mostly.

Why mostly?

Well, this was
the neutral zone, remember?

Yes, it was.
Neutral zone?

After mom and dad
got divorced,

this is where they decided
to drop me off and pick me up

so they wouldn't
have to see each other.

I always tried to make this
a safe place for you

to always feel comfortable
and loved.

You did, mama, always.

Oh! [Laughs]
I remember him.

[Both laughing]

I used to play with this
all the time.

Mm-hmm.

Do you remember
that you broke off the drums

'cause you wanted to see
if they still made sound?

Yes.

I remember
who dared me to do it.

Caleb?
Mm-hmm.

Is that right?
Yeah.


Yes, it is.

Well, at least you fixed it.

Wait, you fixed this?

Yes, he did,
along with this old table.

This is the same table?

What happened to all
the...The scratches

and the nicks and the...
And the marks

from you coloring with those
awful permanent markers

that I always
told you not to use?

I refinished it.

<i> â™ª </i>

I'm...I'm impressed.

Nah, it was all
already there.

Solid, rich wood.

Just needed a little TLC

to bring it back
to what it used to be.

He's being modest.
He's very talented.

And very tired. I should go.

Oh, Caleb, oh,

would you please move me
into the kitchen?

I think I wanna make myself
some cocoa.

Oh, no, no, no. You sit.
I'm gonna make the cocoa.

No, no,
I can make my own cocoa,

thank you very much.

What you can do
is bring me my phone

so that I can call your mother
and tell her what happened.

Wait, I th...I thought
she was out of town.

She came back tonight,
just in time,

because I drew her name
as my secret Santa.

And now that you're here,
you're gonna

have to draw your name
for secret Santa too.

Okay.

Please, Caleb.
Oh, yeah.

<i> [Warm percussive music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Good night.
Night.

<i> â™ª </i>

So we should link up
about the jamboree soon.

Yes, first thing
tomorrow morning,

let's have a meeting.

Should anybody else be there?

About half a dozen people
help run the different events.

Okay, and can you make me
an admin on the project site?

I'd like to have access to all
the different event planners,

contacts, and subfolders.

Yeah, no, that's not our
optimal way to communicate.

Well, tell me you have

a virtual workspace
operational.

Believe it or not,
our preexisting system

has been working for us.

Caleb...[laughs]

I need a centralized way

of getting
in contact with everyone.

Adding you
to the group text right now.

Okay, I'm just saying
things can get clunky

with a back-and-forth
correspondence.

And I'm just saying you may
be way overthinking this.

Point taken.

I can work with the group text.

[Notification chimes]
Got it.

Cool. Talk to you tomorrow.

Hey, uh...

It's nice to know
that...That mama

is in...In good hands.

Appreciate that.

But everyone helps out
around here.

This block is a family.

<i> [Warm music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Hey.

Got you some water.

Thank you, baby.
Mm-hmm.

I'm glad you're here.

[Laughs]

Hey, where's all the stuff
for jamboree?

I wanna take a look
at the schedule of events,

see what needs to be done.

Oh, it's in my office,
but don't move anything.

I have a system.

Okay.

Let's see what you got here.

<i> [Quirky music]</i>

Ha. A system, huh?

<i> â™ª </i>

[Keys clacking]

Jazmin Thomas Carter!

<i> â™ª </i>

What in the name
of St. Nicholas have you done?

I cleaned up, and mama,
where's your wheelchair?

I don't need it.

What about my system?

I made a better one.

A better one?

Where are all my post-its?

Just tell me
what you need, okay?

And please sit.

I need Mickey's
phone number.

I have to call him

about the winter wonderland
fashion bash

along with litch.

Okay, check your phone.

I didn't put it in there.

That's why I need
my post-it notes.

Just look.

It's there.

How did you do that?

I used your desktop
and entered your contacts

and synced them
to your schedule.

There's even a reminder to...

Call Mickey
about the fashion bash

and remember to include litch.


Okay. Okay.

We're gonna see how this goes.

Good.

But just so that you know,

I love my post-it notes.

<i> â™ª </i>

I know.
Hello! Is anybody home?

Sit right there.

You don't need
to be moving, okay?

Tell me where my notes are.

Bottom shelf. Basket.

Ah, here's my little
jet-setter.

Hi, mom.

Ooh, are you sure
you're getting enough rest?

You know, we all need
eight hours of sleep,

including those
who just journey

across all those
different time zones.

Yes, mother.

Maybe you should think
about settling down.

That would be nice...
Mother...

I'm just...I'm glad

to have you home
for the holidays, you know,

especially after mama belle's
unexpected injury.

I know.
I am fine.

Oh, you look fine.

Baby.
You look good.

Yeah, it's just
a little thing.

Oh, good.
Well, why don't we

all sit down,
you know, love, catch up.

I have a lot to tell you about.

I just came back
from New Orleans

with my very special friend.

Um, actually,

I am about to go run
to a meeting for jamboree.

The Christmas jamboree?

Yes, Jazmin was kind enough

to step in while
I'm mildly incapacitated.

Oh, so...So that means

you're gonna be around
for a little while.

Yep, a whole week.
Plenty of time to catch up.

Uh, did you call your dad?
No, not recently.

Why? Isn't he out of town?

He's back.

All right,
when I get a minute.

Love you guys.

Love you too, honey.
Bye.

Bye, bye.

And she's off.

<i> [Soft music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Okay.

<i> â™ª </i>

Thank you, everyone,
for coming.

If you don't know me,
I am Jazmin Carter,

mama belle's granddaughter.

I think she means assailant.
Mm-hmm.

Be nice.

So, um, I...I know I haven't
been home for a while,

and I'm excited
to be working with you all

on jamboree
and get better acquainted.

Better late than never,
I guess.

Hmm.
[Chuckles]

Okay, so let's go over
the schedule of events

for the remaining six days.

First, we have
the basketball snow jam,

then the bake-off,

then we have the art exhibit,

um, poetry slam, fashion bash,

and lastly,
the Christmas Eve dinner.

Baby, we all know
the schedule.

Right, we know the schedule.
It's the same every year.

But I'm here
to streamline the workload.

To implement changes as needed.

To improve and strengthen
for maximum effectiveness.

Implement and strengthen it?
What's that supposed to mean?

What's this?

This is an org chart.
What's that for?

Well, if you just look at
the chart and find your name,

you'll see where you're needed.

But I...I don't know

the first thing
about poetry slams.

But you're in charge
of the fashion bash.

I am.

Which means you have
an eye for aesthetics.

I do.

So why not bring
that Je ne sais quoi

to the poetry slam?

Ooh.
I will not.

Hmm.

Arthur? Alvin? Alvin?

Alvin, you are an athlete.

So Caleb and I
can use your help

for the snow jam,
and miss Arlene,

you are the life of the party,
so why not consider

using your efforts
in...In more than one event?

The holiday bake-off
is my thing every year.

I know my way
around the kitchen.

Yes, she does.
She...She does.

Okay, then, so...So instead

of just cooking
at the bake-off,

why not provide snacks
and charcuterie

to all of the events?

Everybody loves a passed plate.

Um, Jazmin, as co-chairs,

maybe you and I can have
a meeting in the boardroom.

Come on.

What are you doing?
I'm team-building.

The team's built,
and they have

a pretty clear idea
of what they want.

Okay, but if they just look
at my chart,

they see that my way
is more efficient.

They've been doing jamboree
for years, Jazmin,

and besides,
this group can get riled

about too much change
too quickly.

Okay, then what
is my purpose here?

Be supportive, help with
emergencies that come up,

and lend an extra hand
at each event.

I don't know.

Don't try to fix something
that isn't broken.

Hey, just trust me on this.

Meeting adjourned.

Okay, so I might have
overthought a few things.

So how about
we just table that chart

and you guys just keep doing
what you know how to do?

All: Mm-hmm.

Hey, mama belle.

Oh, jaz.

Hey, would you like
to help me with these?

Ooh, yes.
[Both laugh]

And I'm just in time
for icing too.

Okay.

All right. Uh-uh.

Yes.

So how was jamboree?

Okay...for the most part.

Working with Caleb is fine.

I don't know,
there's just a lot

about the way things are
that I don't remember.

Hmm.

Do me a favor.

Go over, look under the tree,
and grab the gold bag.

The gold bag?

The one and only.

[Giggling]

Secret Santa.

You know...You know, I used
to think you fixed this.

How do you mean?

Like, you would give everyone

the person you think
they should have

so that you would think
about them

and appreciate them more
right when it mattered most.

Like when I picked mom
and her and I were fighting

about what college
I should go to.

It...it really,
really helped us

make up over the holidays.

[Laughs]

Well, next thing,
you'll credit me for wishes

made on the Christmas star.

It's above my pay grade,
baby girl,

but it's nice to know you think
something so grand of me.

So go ahead, pick one.

Who'd you get?

It's a secret.

Oh, it's a secret.
[Both laughing]

It's a secret.

All right, let's do this.

<i> [Indistinct chatter]</i>
<i> [Shoes squeaking]</i>

<i> - I see you, red!</i>

Come on, defense!

Open! Buckets!

[Cheers and applause]

All right, d! Oh!

Uh-oh. Uh-oh!

Easy bucket!
Easy bucket!

[Cheers and applause]

We talked about
this, like, halftime thing.

So all we gotta do...

Coach Armstrong!
Man, good to see you.

Oh, man.

How you doing?
I'm well. Oh.

All right. Hold on.
[Laughs]

Is that
my former point guard?

Jaz, with the crossover.
Girl, you are all grown up.

[Laughs] Hi, coach.
Oh, man.

How are you?

All is well. All is well.

I mean, your family
must be happy

you are home for the holidays.

Yes, they are.

That is good. Hey, listen.

We'll catch up later,
all right?

All right.
Caleb, I'll see you around.

All right, coach.

Hey, is she still coaching?

Coach?
Yeah.

No, she's
a council member now.

What?
Yeah.

Whoa.

[Cheers and applause]

Good to see you.

Daddy!

Hey, baby girl.

Hey, daddy.
Mm!

Oh, I've been meaning
to call you, but...

Okay.
Mom...

Mom told me
that you were back in town.

Yeah, and I hear you're
responsible for all of this.

Thank you.
Oh, and I'm so proud of you.

Thank you,
but how did you hear that?

Your mom told me.

Since when are you guys
talking all the time?

Listen,
when you get some time,

there's something I want
to talk to you about.

[Buzzer blares]

Um, there's
this halftime thing

I gotta take care of.

Maybe later?

Okay.

You ready to make
your emcee debut?

I'm ready.

Jazmin got the mic!

Yeah, yeah.
[Laughs]

All right, all right,
all right, all right,

all right, all right,
it is halftime!

So you know what that means.

It is time to shoot your shot
with Santa!

[Cheers and applause]

All right, so I need
a line here, just the kids.

I'm so sorry, adults,
but just the kids.

Please line up here.

So you take your shot,
and you receive a gift.

Now, take your time.
Let's give them some noise.

Let's do it.
Come on!

Oh, you're so close!
But you still get a gift.

Let's see it.
The concentration.

Can she make it?

And...oh!

And you receive a gift!

Let's go.
Who's next?

Oh, oh!

And that wraps up this year's
Christmas snow jam giveaway.

Thank you!

[Cheers and applause]

I think that was good.

[Cheers and applause]

Thank you.



Katrina, in the flesh.

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!


I'm good. How are you?

Mother of two?

Soon to be three.
Uh-oh.

They are so beautiful.

They are...It is hectic,
but it is beautiful.

But you look great.
You...

Look at you.


Here.

I think that went well.

It did.

You did a great job.
[Laughs] Thanks.

Oh, kudos to you
and your approach.

I mean, everything went
smoothly, just like you said.

Well, then cheers
to us both.

Think you can handle
a little one-on-one?

Horse or 21?

You choose.

Uh-oh,
somebody's feeling confident.

I've been training
in the off-season,

Ms. Crossover dribble.

You know, I used to watch
all your games from up there.

Okay, creep.

No, I'm not a creep.

But for real,
I had a little...

I had a little notebook...
Mm-hmm.

And I would record
all your stats.

I'd write them down.

So that's how you knew
all my stats.

You know, I just...
I never saw you.

So I just figured
you never came to my games.

Now you know my secret.

I love watching you play.

Oh!

<i> [Soft music]</i>

Oh, buckets!

You got lucky,
you got lucky.

I got lucky?
Yeah.

All right.
Watch out.

What you gonna do?
Back up.

Uh-huh.

Uh...oh...

[Laughs]

<i> [Upbeat festive music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Hello.

Hello.

Hey, jaz.
Are you sure you should

be on the ground
like that working?

Oh, yeah, it's fine.

My doctor cleared it,
plus I have to stay busy.

Kwame is a great father
and husband,

but he is on the road a lot.
[Laughs]

Oh, my, I know I'm behind

in terms of, like,
being back and everything,

but you and DJ Kwame?

And I love his podcast,
and every time

he gives you a shout-out,
my heart just melts.

[Laughs]

And you and Caleb
are running the store?

Yeah, it's nice.
And you know what?

Caleb is so helpful
with Jay and Eli.

So, uh, where is he?

I...i gotta run some things
by him for jamboree.

He is at his place
working on a project.

Um...

Hmm.

What are you doing now?
Come on.

<i> â™ª </i>

Give any thought to sticking
around post-Christmas?

Still getting used
to the idea

of being here for Christmas.

Uh! [Laughs]

You know, in high school,
Caleb used to carry mistletoe

around in his pocket,

hoping he'd find
the perfect moment

to tack it up
so you guys could kiss.

No, he did not.
He did.

No, he did not.
He did! Every Christmas!

He was never brave enough
to bust it out, though.

Well, yeah, but that's
'cause we were just friends.

Look, I married
my best friend,

and it is the smartest decision
I ever made.

<i> â™ª </i>

Oh, yes, yes!

Look at her.

She is a beauty.

What do you think?
[Laughs]

I like it.
This is it.

I think we should get it.
This is it.

That's the one.

<i> â™ª </i>

Hey, hey.

Ooh, it is looking really good.
[Chuckles]

I see you found the old box
of Christmas stuff.

Yeah, it was right
where mom and dad left it.

Oh, I miss them.

Your parents
were always so solid.

Yeah, mom got sick first,

and dad gave everything he had
to take care of her.

And then he got sick.

Luckily, Caleb
had already moved home,

so we took turns
taking care of them together.

It is like memory Lane
in here.

Mm-hmm. Oh.

What do we got here?
Oh, that's mine.

Oh, oh, hold on.

I think it's got
something inside.

No, it doesn't.
Oh, okay.

Is this what I think it is?

No, it's not.
It's a poem.

Okay, hold on, hold on.
But...Yeah.

"That renaissance dude."
Uh-huh.

"He's so smooth."
[Laughs]

"Never crass
or late to class.

"We get as
'cause we built that way.

"The sky is the beginning,
not just the limit.

Merry Christmas.
I'm your ace."

Oh.

"We run NYC,
this whole place."

Ah! [Snapping]

Now, if that
isn't a masterpiece,

I don't know what is.

Langston Hughes
would be very proud.

Yeah, ace and...And place.
I am a genius.

Give me my box, please.
Yeah.

You know, that's from
Ms. Pettis' fifth grade class.

I do.
The Christmas exchange.

Yes, I do.

And we were supposed
to write each other poems,

but instead of a poem
from you,

I got a red starburst.

Well, then I guess
I owe you a poem, ace.

I think you do.

<i> â™ª </i>

Oh, it's Kwame. I gotta go.

All right,
you guys have fun.


[Sighs]

I can't believe
you kept this.

You hungry?

Uh, yeah.
Starved, actually.

Well, I know a great spot.

Okay.
I'ma grab my coat.

Okay.

I'm telling you, you are
going to love this spot.

I'm gonna love it?
Mm-hmm.

Okay.
All right.

All right, let's see.

I'm telling you
this is my spot.

Okay.

You're gonna love it.
I'm telling you.

Oh, Caleb.
Sam.

Hey.
How are you?

I am great, man.
Always good to see you.

You too.
Who's this lovely lady?

Sam, meet Jazmin Carter.

Oh, wait a minute,
not the Jazmin Carter.

Mm-hmm.

The one who most graciously

stepped in for mama belle
in her time of need

to host the Christmas jamboree?

That's me. [Laughs]

Okay, yeah.
Well, you know what?

It's a pleasure
to finally meet you, Jazmin.

Yeah, so we got your coats.
Uh, yeah.

Please follow me.
Okay.

Come on.
[Laughs]

<i> [Jazzy piano music playing]</i>

Ms. Jazmin.

Thank you.

<i> â™ª </i>

All right, so...

Prepare yourselves
for a most elegant meal.

Chef's choice,
all on the house, of course.

All right?
Thank you.

Thank you.
All right, enjoy.

<i> â™ª </i>

Hope this is okay.
It's great.

Is this a date?

Kind of feels like a date.

Do you want it to be?

Um...I'm leaving
after jamboree.

Right.

Then it's just two friends
having dinner.

<i> [Soft music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

I'm telling you.
I know you was MVP.

Don't play with me.

Yeah, nope. That was tough.

[Both laughing]

I have a question.

What happened to us?

I always knew after high school
that you'd go off to college,

and, you know, I was enlisting.

You know, I never imagined

that I wouldn't
hear from you again.

I mean, nothing.

That is until a few days ago.

Okay, Caleb...

I'm sorry.

It wasn't intentional.

I mean, obviously, I...I did it,
but it wasn't because

I...it wasn't
because I didn't care.

Everything was just so crazy
in my life.

My parents and just...

I just needed to move on,
find something of my own.

Fight or flight, huh?

[Laughs]

I guess. No, I don't know.

I...i didn't know
how to...I didn't know

how to keep some things
while letting other things go.

And honestly,
I still struggle with that.

Yeah, even now,
when I'm done with a project,

I rarely, if ever,
keep in contact with anyone

or anything attached to it.

Is it lonely
living like that?

Sometimes.

But no loose ends.

What if loose ends
are the point?

All right, you two.
How was everything?

Amazing.
Good.

And I'm glad you enjoy it.

So look,
answer me this question.

Was it good enough
for jamboree?

I think so.
Yeah, good.

Then why is it
that my restaurant

is yet to be chosen
to, you know,

serve Christmas Eve dinner?

Sam, now, you know
mama belle has a lottery

to pick the restaurant
every year.

Yeah, but I have yet to win.
I don't know.

Look, how do I even know
it's fair, Caleb?

I mean, maybe mama belle...

Maybe she just chooses
her own favorite.

She'd never do that.
Yeah, well...

I still think it should be
a more Democratic process.

Yeah, don't you?

I...i do, yes.

<i> â™ª </i>

You better watch out
for that guy.

Why? He seems nice.

Uh, he's always
got an agenda.

<i> [Soft music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Well, that was fun.

It was.
[Chuckles]

Oh, next up we got
our...Our final three events.

Mm-hmm.

The poetry slam,
the fashion bash,

and lastly and most important,
the Christmas Eve dinner.

And then you can
be on your merry way.

[Laughs]
Wait, my merry way?

Your job,

the one that keeps you
in flight.

<i> â™ª </i>

Oh. Right

oh.

<i> â™ª </i>

I'll see you.
Yeah.

<i> [Mellow music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

And may we never forget
in each exchange of merriment

that the greatest gifts
we receive

will never wrap neatly
in a bow.

Thank you.

[Applause, snaps]

Thank you, brother.

Good evening, everyone.

Once again,
thank you all for coming

to this year's
Christmas poetry slam.

As a reminder, this year's
theme is the best present.

The title of my poem is,

"in honor of my father's
grandfather clock."

<i> [Light acoustic music]</i>

Tick tock,

time stops
and the sun stands still.

When I am allowed to touch
your essence, see your truth.

As determined
as a little drummer boy

with the percussion to mend.

<i> â™ª </i>

[Laughs softly]

<i> â™ª </i>

My humble hands
are meant to help,

sustain, and restore you
however you need evermore.

Thank you.

[Applause, snaps]

And now on to our next poet.

<i> â™ª </i>


[Whispering] That was good.

So you're just
gonna pop in on me

right in the middle
of my poem like that?

[Laughs] No, I just...

The little drummer boy
reference,

that kinda hit close to home.

I'm glad.

Timing is everything.
[Clapping]

That was phenomenal, Caleb.

I didn't even know
you was a poet.

Yes, sir.
Hi, daddy.

Hey. Mm.

Oh, Caleb, that was great.
Oh, yeah.

That was great.
Thank you so much.

Hi.
Mom.

Um...

<i> [Light music]</i>

Why are you here?

Well, we're here
for the poetry slam.

Uh-huh.

No, but why are you
here together?

Well, we are together, jaz.

I'm sorry, what?

And on that, I believe
you all need some alone time.

Oh. Thank you.

Yeah, we tried to tell you.

You know, when I came by mama's
to tell you

about my trip
and my very special friend?

And I came by
the snow jam shoot out

to talk to you about it.

Okay.

Okay.

Uh...

I'm not angry.

I'm surprised.


And your timing is impeccable.

[Phone ringing]

One sec.

Hello? Mama belle?

Yes, okay.

I'll be right there.

Um, is everything okay?

I don't know,
but I'm gonna fix it.

Yes, the restaurant
has already been chosen.

Well, I am sorry
that you feel that way.

Hey, mama,
is everything okay?

Something tells me
you already know

the answer to that question.

Does this have to do
with Sam?

He may have mentioned
some concerns

about Christmas Eve dinner.

Just some concerns?

My phone has been ringing
off the hook.

Apparently, Sam feels that
my lottery is undemocratic

and is starting a rebellion
on social media.

Oh, no.
But it gets better.

Seems that all the restaurants
in Harlem agree with him.

Chefs have been calling left
and right trying to change

how we have been doing things
for years.

Goodness.

Sam also said
that the new chair

of the Christmas jamboree
agrees with him.

Well...

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, mama belle.

I know how important
this is to you.

Yeah, I know,

but it looks like we have
a few fires to put out.

No, this is on me.

I'm going to take care
of everything.

I promise.

<i> [Light music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

[Notification chimes]
Mm.


<i> About that cocktail...</i>
<i> Never made it.</i>

You're still in Harlem
for the holidays?

Well, that must be nice.

Yeah, it's nice.

Nice. Really nice and amazing.

And actually nice.

<i> I'm just frustrated.</i>

I had to step in and chair
this year's jamboree,

and all of the things that
make me really good at my job,

they just aren't working here.

Not working yet.

Give it some time.

You'll figure it out
with a little Patience,

<i> because that's</i>
<i> what you're good at.</i>

Seeing all sides of a problem,
listening,

and then making it work
for everyone.

Yeah, yeah, you're right.

Thank you.

Thank you.
I needed to hear that.

Promise me one thing.

When this is all settled,
you and I will have

another conversation
about the New York promotion?

Shouldn't we give it
some time?

[Laughs]
Sure, we can do that.

<i> [Soft music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Good morning.

Morning.

Hey, do you know
if mama's still mad?

Uh, no, but I wouldn't
call her happy either.

I'm gonna change that.

Jaz, about me and your dad...

I am so sorry
we surprised you last night.

We did not mean to upset you,
especially during the holidays.

It's okay.
I'm kinda used to it.

Going back and forth
between you and dad's

during the holidays,
I think I was always trying

to make it work for everyone,
but doing all that

didn't exactly put me
in the holiday spirit.

Oh, I am so sorry, baby.

I didn't know
you felt like this.

It's okay.

I didn't either.

But I love you.

And right now, I gotta go fix
this Christmas Eve dinner.

<i> â™ª </i>

Well, I love you too.

Okay. Bye, mom.

Bye, honey.

<i> [Upbeat festive music]</i>

<i> [Knock on door]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Okay, so I think
I have a solution

for this whole Sam thing.

Is that right?

Yeah. What...What's this?

Just a project
I'm working on.

Yeah, and this is a classic
armoire from the '30s

that I refinished.
Huh.

So you restore and design.

Yeah, I mean,

carpentry has deep roots
in this neighborhood.

If you look around,
you see it everywhere.

Restored facades,
at church, people's homes.

I admire the craft,
and I feel like Iâ€™m,

I don't know,
a part of a tradition.

Hmm.
What?

No, that's...That's...
That's beautiful.

Thank you.

So about Sam.
Ah, yeah.

Grab your vest.

And where's your decorations?

Come on. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

Let's go. Come on.

Oh.
Go, go, go.

Did you or did you not say

that my food was good enough
for jamboree?

I did.
Yeah, and you also agreed

that mama Bella's lottery
system was undemocratic, right?

I did,
but that was before I knew

of the long-standing
and fair tradition.

And then you went on
social media demanding change.

Yeah, and everybody
seems to agree with me.

But it's too late to do
anything about it this year.

So why don't you delete
your post, say you're sorry,

and say you made a mistake?

That's not gonna happen.

[Speaking French]

Didn't know you
speak French.

Something I picked up.
What'd you say to him?

I told him I had a couple
hundred thousand followers

on social media,
and if he didn't back down,

I would post a scathing review.

Wait, you have
that many followers?

I may have added
a couple zeros.

Nice.

I looked it up
and found these.

And you be speaking French.
[Laughs]

I don't understand
how you...

And this, my dear,

is our signature
chicken and waffles

with some vegan Greens
on the side.

[Laughs]

You don't have to tell me,
Patrice.

I've been eating it
my whole life.

Enjoy.
Okay. I will, again.

[Both laughing]

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

Um...
How you doing?

What...what is...
What is going on here?

I think that Sam
has started a movement.

We just got back from Sam's.

He...he...he said
he would retract his statement

and apologize.

But maybe he has a point.

I mean, all these chefs want

is a chance
to serve Christmas Eve dinner.

But you...But...

If the people
want to change it up,

maybe we should listen.

But no.
And now,

since you are in charge,

you have a lot of food to try.

Me?
Here, my dear. Have a seat.

Sit, okay.

Let's go, Caleb.

Where are you going?

You're on your own
on this one.

No.
Yeah.

No, Caleb. Caleb! Hey!

<i> â™ª </i>

Hi, okay.

Thank you.

Next.

<i> - â™ª Are you ready, ready? </i>

Well, y'all, it's the winter
wonderland fashion bash.

[Cheers and applause]

That's what I'm talking about.

We got a lovely show
for you tonight.

Are y'all ready
to get this party started?

'Cause I want y'all to get
ready for these fashions.

Come on up in here.
Let's get this started.

Now, you're not ready
for this one.

We got this lovely look,
and look at this gentleman

right there in this whole suit,
looking all good.

Now, ladies, calm it down, now.

[Clears throat]

[Laughing] Daddy.

What? What's that
look of surprise for?

I'm not handsome enough
to be a model?

No, you are, you are.

You know, your mom said
you're still a little upset.

Can we find some time
to talk about it?

Yeah, I mean, I just...

I got a...I got a lot
on my plate, dad.

Jaz, I want you to think
about whether or not

you're too busy
to have a conversation

or whether or not you're
making yourself too busy

so you don't have to have one.

This is a local,
local designer.

A local designer, Earl shep,
who did this right here.

I know, yeah. You look good.

Earl did you right.

Thomas, you're up next.

Well, let's see.

You ready?
Yeah.

Go get 'em.

<i> â™ª </i>

So...
Oh, here we go.

Oh, right now
looking sharp up in here.

Hey, hey, come on.
Give it to him.

I really hope
he doesn't do the bump.

All right, y'all
let's give a...Oh.

[Cheers and applause]

Oh, my goodness!

Oh, my!

Oh, he doing it.
He doing it.

[Laughs]
Did you teach him that?

Yes, I taught him that.

[Laughs] Wait, hey. Oh.

Your dad's got swag, ace.

[Cheers and applause]

The crowd sure seems
to be eating it up.

He's making sure
he does something different

for everybody.

That's brilliant.
It's brilliant.

Hmm?

Thank you?

<i> [Soft music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

I think I found a solution
for the Christmas Eve dinner.

Don't tell me
you're going to cook.

Oh, no.

Don't tell me
I'm going to cook.

No.

I think everyone should cook.

Like a potluck?

Not exactly, but it won't be
a formal dinner either.

It'll be a little something
different for everyone.

I'm not following you, honey.

A block party.

With food trucks, food carts,
vendors, and music.

Everyone can go
from station to station

and eat whatever
their hearts desire.

A Christmas Eve block party.

Bingo. It's festive.

Everyone from the neighborhood
is invited.

All the local restaurants
are included.

It's a win-win.

A Christmas Eve dinner

has been a jamboree tradition
since before I can remember.

Has the poetry slam
been a tradition

for as long
as you can remember?

No, but that's...
And the fashion show?

No, no.

I mean,
there have been updates

throughout the years.

That's all I'm suggesting,
an update.

The people are asking
for something new,

so let's give it to them.

With food trucks
and dancing?

Mm-hmm.

That could sound like fun.

Please, please, please,
please, please, please,

please, please, mama belle.

All I want for Christmas
is a Christmas Eve block party.

Please.
[Chuckles]

Okay, okay.

You know I cannot resist
that face.

[Giggles] Okay.

Christmas Eve
is around the corner.

I mean, there's a lot to do.

You're gonna
have to advertise, find music,

get permits from the city.

That's a lot to organize.

If there's one thing
I know how to do,

it's how to make an org chart.

What in the world
is an org chart?

Okay, everyone.

And I know...I know,
another chart, but hear me out.

With mama belle's blessing,

we have decided to make
a last-minute change

to the final event of jamboree.

Here we go again.
Be nice.

Instead of a formal
Christmas Eve dinner,

we are going to have

a fun, entertaining,
music-filled block party.

Okay, I like
this plan already.

Okay.
Okay.

But we only have two days
to pull it off

and I need your help,
so if you look at the charts...

Girl, do you need tables?

My uncle rents
outdoor equipment for parties.

Propane heaters, I got you.

I've got some extra lumber.

I could throw together a stage.

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

I'm about to cry.

Okay, great.

So all we need now
is a playlist...

I'll make it...
And rent a sound system,

and the last thing,
I think we just need permits,

and that should be easy, right?

Nope.

But it's for our first annual
Christmas Eve block party.

The whole neighborhood's
invited.

You should come.
Bring your family.

Next.

Great work.

We'll do it again
next week, okay?

Hey, jaz.
Hi.

So glad I caught you, coach.

Well, what brings you here?

I need permits for jamboree.

It's for our first annual
Christmas Eve block party.

And I'm assuming
you didn't file them

48 hours in advance
like you're supposed to?

Nope.

Yeah, I realize
that I am super late,

but it's our closing event,
and it's really focused

on giving back
to the neighborhood,

celebrating Harlem.

It's a party,
and everyone's invited.

Well, it does sound
like a good cause.

Mm-hmm.
Would you like an assist?

Please.
I got you.

Okay.

Spread some of that love.
Come on, now.

<i> [Light festive music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

[Indistinct chatter]

<i> â™ª </i>

Mm, there you go.
Thank you.

<i> â™ª </i>

[Grunts]

<i> â™ª </i>

Okay, now you take
that gift with you.

Are you coming with me,
or are you staying there?

No, I'm going...
Okay, all right.

Thank you.

And you guys got that,
so that's good.

Hey, you are making
quick work of this stage.

It's not exactly
high-end carpentry,

but it'll do the job.

Everything's really
coming together.

Tomorrow is gonna be great.

I think it's just what
the neighborhood needs.

Thanks for taking
the initiative.

Happy to help.

Can I help here?

Yeah.

What do I do?
[Drill whirs]

Let's just load it up
in the bag, yeah?

Oh, come on. Let me do one.

[Speaking indistinctly]

Oh, thanks.
Yeah.

You can't say
I never helped you.

Mm.
This.

I carried all of this.

All by myself, I carried it.

Yeah, you did.
So heavy.

<i> [Soft music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

You like that piece, huh?

Yeah, it's nice.

You should...You should
really sell those.

Where? At the store?

I mean, we're already
busting at the seams.

Well, get a bigger store.

You mean
a more expensive store?

No.

I mean...I don't know.

You never grow
if you don't take risks.

Jackson hardware store
has been in the same location

since before I was born.

My folks left it
to me and Trina,

and now that she's
got a family,

I just can't afford
to take a risk like that.

Mm-hmm.

But I hate to break it to you.

That decision
is kind of up to Katrina

and her husband to make.

You see,
my family is my life, jaz.

I know that.
That's a good thing.

Your family is your life

until you have a family
of your own.

What about a family
of your own?

Okay.


Um, Caleb, all I'm saying
is I think that you're amazing,

and I think
that you're too talented

not to invest in yourself.

You know who's amazing? You.

I mean, how long
have you been back?

A week?

You walk around here

like you think you know
what's best for everyone.

You got everyone
jumping through hoops

for your big block party

because your think
it's what they want.

It is what they want.
Are you sure?

Yes, I'm sure it is.
Okay.

But you left Harlem
a long time ago, Jazmin.

What makes you
so confident you know?

<i> [Tense music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Look, I'm sorry.

I think I'm gonna go.

<i> â™ª </i>

Jaz, I...

<i> â™ª </i>

<i> [Dramatic music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

I've seen
that sad face before.

Anything wrong with jamboree?

No, no, it's actually
gonna be really great.

Is there something
you want to talk about?

Maybe later.

Okay.

Night.

Good night, baby.

And please sit down,
mama belle.

Don't worry about me.

Do you need a hand?
I got it.

There's just not enough room
for everything.

And I just argued with Jazmin.

She thinks we need
a bigger space.

I think that's a great idea.

We need to upgrade.

We are getting deliveries
every day.

We have nowhere
to put anything.

And if we had a bigger space,
you could sell your designs.

I just don't think
it's a good idea, okay?

You already got two kids
and another one on the way.

Listen, little brother.

It is not your job
to take care of me.

I love that you're
concerned for us, I do,

but not at the expense
of your own dreams.

Mom and dad
didn't leave us this store

so we could get stuck here.

They left it to us
so we could grow it, build it,

have an opportunity for more.

Think about it.

Mm-hmm.

<i> [Soft piano music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

[Knock at door]

Hey, good morning.

Hi, mom.
Well, it's the big day.

It's the Christmas Eve
block party.

Mm, ooh.

Oh, you and dad are a pair.

Yeah, only I make
my air bumps real.

You know, mama told me
you went to bed blue.

I was hoping that you'd
wake up feeling different.

It's Caleb, isn't it?

Oh, now, you can't fool me.

You used to have
that exact same look

when you two fought
in middle school.

And high school.

Elementary, too,
if I'm really reflecting.

[Murmurs indistinctly]

You know why you get so upset
when you two fight?

No.

Because you love him.

<i> [Gentle music]</i>

Caleb...

Caleb said something to me
at dinner the other night.

It really stuck.

Fight or flight.

Running came natural to me.

Shuffling between
three households,

constantly trying
to escape the arguments,

the uncertainty.

Running kept me safe,

allowed me to catch my breath,

but, uh, I'm tired,

and I don't wanna do it
anymore.

But I also don't know
how not to do it.

<i> â™ª </i>

Jazmin, I am very sorry
that we put you through that.

I know we believed we were

doing the best
we could at the time.

I know. I know.

We didn't want you
to learn how to fight.

We wanted you
to learn how to love,

and we thought
the best way to do that

was separately, on our own.

What we didn't know
is that it would end up

making you more ready
to leave people and situations

before you could get attached

or invested
to see things through.

But the great news

is that each day
is a fresh start.

You know, we can move forward,
and we can heal.

That's how your dad and I
ended up where we are now.

<i> â™ª </i>

Thanks, mom.

<i> â™ª </i>

Ooh.
[Laughs]

Oh, oh. Uh.
Okay.

Okay, okay, okay.

[Both laughing]

<i> [Light festive music]</i>

Ooh, baby girl.

It looks like you're ready
to have some fun.

Thank you.
And you, too, mama belle.

Are you ready to finally
get out of the house?

You betcha.

And look,
I'm doing it in style.

Ooh. [Laughs]
Wow, that's nice.

Yeah, your mom
brought it over.

I've been doing my stretches
and working with my cane

a little bit better
every day, so...

Oh, let me help you.
Oh, thank you.

Sounds like you're
gonna be right back to normal

very, very soon.

Yeah, and how about you?

Did you work out everything
that was bothering you before?

Yeah.
Mom came to talk to me.

Oh, good.

You know, since your parents
are trying to work things out,

your mother is actually finding

a little more balance
in her life.

Uh-oh, next thing
you're gonna tell me

she's gonna be front row
in your yoga class?

It will happen.
You Mark my words.

[Both laugh]

I bought her a yoga mat

for secret Santa,
and that's a start.

Secret Santa!
I...I completely forgot.

No, I think it will be okay,

'cause between
the local artists

and all the vendors,
I think I'll be able

to find the perfect gift
at the block party.

Well, let's get a move on.

Let's go.
Been holding my appetite,

and I can't do that
much longer.

[Both laughing]

<i> â™ª </i>

What...where's...

Where is everyone?

The heck?

Mom. Hey, dad.

Hi, honey.
Hey, hey.

You know, I thought
there'd be a bigger turnout.

It's not even that cold.

Well, give it some time.
The people gonna come.

I'm gonna play some music.

Now, that's a good idea.

Come on.

Hey.
I talk about you both so much.

It is so great
to have you finally meet.

Jazmin, Kwame. Kwame, Jazmin.

Hi! Hi, Kwame.

I'm so...I'm so happy
to finally meet you.

You, too, um, and I see

you're having a problem
with the sound system.

Are the speakers blown?
Yeah.

I have speakers at home.

Of course you do,
because you...You're a DJ.

That's what you do.

And I might ask you
for a little favor.

I'm being very conservative
when I say little.

So I was...I made
a playlist, right?

And I was gonna plug it
into the speaker system,

but even with
a working speaker system,

I don't think there's anything
that I could do to...

Say no more.

Let me run home
and get my gear.

Babe, you wanna tag team
with me on this?

Wouldn't have it
any other way.

Watch the kids?
Yeah, on it.

Thank you! Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

Y'all go play
some basketball.

I'll be right over there.
All right.

See y'all in a bit.

[Clears throat]

So are we gonna talk,

or are you gonna give me
the silent treatment?

We're talking.
I'm good. We're good.

All right.
Yeah.

Hey, we had a fight, okay?

So what?

It's not the end of the world.

Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said...

No, no, I'm sorry.

I was outta line.

And you were right.

<i> [Gentle music]</i>

I wanted you to know
that Trina and I talked,

and we're exploring options
about expanding the store.

Nuh-uh.
Yeah.

Really?
Yeah.

Really? Come on.


Caleb...

Caleb, that makes me so happy.

Yeah, me too.
Yeah.

Oh, I gotta run in the house
and put my face on,

but you can finish up out here.

Yeah.

<i> [Light festive music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

What up, what up, what up?

[Cheers and applause]

It's DJ Kwame holding it down

for our first annual
Christmas Eve block party.

How y'all feelin' out there?

[Cheers and applause]

Oh, come on.
Y'all can do better than that.

How y'all feel?

[Cheers and applause]

Time to set it off.

<i> - â™ª I wanna wish you</i>

<i> â™ª I wanna wish you</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

They look happy together,
don't they?

What's not to be happy about?

<i> â™ª </i>

These are beautiful.

But I'm looking for
a little something specific.

<i> [Upbeat music]</i>

<i> - â™ª All around us,</i>
<i> we see the lights shine â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª now we're looking down,</i>
<i> and it's the right time â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª got a feeling</i>

[laughing]
Excuse me.

Gregory Hines.
Debbie Allen.


Uh-oh.
Okay.


Can I steal you for a moment?

Okay.
All right.


<i> â™ª </i>

Mama, why are you bringing me
all the way over here?


It has been amazing
having you here.

[Laughs]

It's been amazing being here.

And you promised

that you were going to do
a fantastic job

chairing Christmas jamboree,

and you have done that.

Thank you.

And tomorrow's
Christmas day.

And the day after that
is the day after that.

<i> â™ª </i>

What are your plans?

<i> â™ª </i>

I, uh...I'm...

You know...

I love you,

and I have missed you.

But more importantly, I do not
want to see cycles repeated.

<i> [Solemn music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Caleb is a good man.

<i> â™ª </i>

Don't lead him on
if you're not planning to stay.

He deserves better than that.

<i> â™ª </i>

I understand.

<i> â™ª </i>

You did a fantastic job.

<i> â™ª </i>

Y'all, all right.
I'll see y'all.

<i> â™ª </i>

Oh!
[Laughs]

Ready to get back
on the floor?

[Laughs]

Um...

It's been a long night.
Yeah.

It's a great night.

It's a great night,
uh, but a long night,

um, and you know, these shoes,
I gotta take 'em off.

So I think...

I think I might turn in.

And the project is over.

Is this your way
of cleaning up loose ends?

<i> â™ª </i>

N...um...
Right. Okay.

I know you prefer clean breaks.

Wait. Caleb?

<i> â™ª </i>

Tomorrow's Christmas.

Can we just...

Can we just enjoy it together?

I don't wanna fight.

We're not gonna fight

okay.

[Laughs]
Till tomorrow.

Yeah.

<i> [Soft music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

And the lady takes flight,
again.

Merry Christmas.

<i> [Soft music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

Merry Christmas!
[Laughing]

Merry Christmas, baby girl.

It is so good
to see my little girl

on a Christmas morning again.

[Laughs]

I wouldn't wanna be
anywhere else.

You think it's time?

I do.
For...What?

For the family
Mac and cheese recipe.

[Gasps] Oh, okay.
Oaky, now, rule number one.

Okay.
Relax.

All right.

'Cause we're cooking
with love.

So nothing but fun.
Mm-hmm.

Oh, and rule number two.

A spatula can be used to mix,

but it can also be used
as a microphone,

if a karaoke vibe gets you.

I'm just saying.
Ah, okay, okay.

Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

You can't forget
about rule number three.

You can't just eat
anybody's Mac and cheese.

Ooh, now, that's ripe
for an amen right there.

That's a double amen.
Amen, amen.

Amen.
Amen.

What are you doing

Nothing.

Just, um...

Just, you know.

I love you too.

Oh, now I'm jealous.
What's that for?

You get some too.

Oh.

<i> [Gentle music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

This is good.
Mm.

This...this...this is...
This is everything.

<i> â™ª </i>

Mom, mama belle,

there's something
that you should know.

I was, um...

I was offered a job
at my company.

Vice president
of North America.

Ooh, now, that sounds
like a promotion.

It is,

only that, um,
I'd be based here in New York,

and Iâ€™d...I'd still travel.

Just not as much.

<i> â™ª </i>

And...
And...

Yes, Iâ€™m...I'm gonna
take the position.

[Laughing] Oh!

Oh, love.

That is the best
Christmas present

you could ever give me.

Oh, I am so happy, too,
baby girl,

mm-mm-mm.


But, jaz, I want you to know
I know what you're doing.

Hmm?

You're trying to upstage
my secret Santa.


I love you guys.

<i> â™ª </i>

Hey, daddy.

Oh...oh, hey, jaz.

I was just checking
to see if your mom

got me socks like she used to.

[Laughs]

So how's it going
in the kitchen?

Good. It's great.

Actually, it's...
It's almost done.

You know, this day means
a lot to your mom and me.

Me too.

You know,
it's been a long time

since the family spent
Christmas together.

We haven't done that
since you was a little girl.

Oh, I know.

And I'm sorry
about that, jaz.

I mean, I really am,
but we thought...

Well, we thought
it was the best thing for you.

Hey, no more apologies.

You did the best you could.

We all did.
And I turned out okay, right?

You turned out perfect.

Come here.

Give me a hug.
I love you.

I love you too.

Now let's open this.

Oh, yeah.

<i> - â™ª The season's</i>

Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

Mm!

Merry Christmas.

<i> - â™ª Christmas is here </i>

merry Christmas.

Oh, my goodness.
Merry Christmas.

Do you think we can talk
for a little minute?

Yeah. Maybe later?

<i> - â™ª There's only one thing </i>

<i> â™ª that I got on my mind</i>
<i> this year â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª yeah, wanna set</i>

<i> â™ª wanna say it</i>

<i> â™ª I wanna give you</i>
<i> a piece of my soul â™ª</i>

<i> â™ª and I wanna find me with you</i>
<i> under the mistletoe â™ª</i>

[Indistinct chatter]

I did do that.

I just have to tell everyone

that there's nothing
that makes me happier

than Christmas dinner.

It's a very special
time of year

when we get to spend time
with the people we love most.

And this Christmas
is even more special.

My daughter
has rediscovered love,

and my granddaughter,

my baby girl,

is finally home
for good, y'all.

[Laughs]
What?

Yeah, yeah.

Wow.
Thank you.

Can we talk?

I don't know.

I'm kinda liking
the group vibe right now.

You around later?

Yeah, I am.

Let's bow our heads.

<i> â™ª </i>

Merry Christmas.

There you are.

And here you are.

So what's this about you
coming home for good?

I just decided it was time

to come back home
to the neighborhood.

Why is that?
I don't know.

There's too many reasons
to say them all.

Try it.

It's family, mostly...

And friends.

What's this?

You are my secret Santa.

Really?
Mm-hmm.

Okay.

I hope you didn't
spend a fortune.

Well, it's better than
a red starburst.


<i> [Soft piano music]</i>

<i> â™ª </i>

What you got for me?

What you got for me?


<i> â™ª </i>

This time, you don't
have to carry it around

in your pocket all the time.

No?
No.

<i> â™ª </i>

Trina told you.

<i> â™ª </i>

Well...[laughs]

<i> â™ª </i>

Merry Christmas, drummer boy.

Merry Christmas, ace.

<i> â™ª </i>

Oh, man.
