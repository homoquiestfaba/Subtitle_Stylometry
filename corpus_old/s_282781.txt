Kushimori!

You'll be late.
Hurry!

I made it.

Move!

Good morning.

That bike again...
Road racer.

Why don’t you take the train?

I brought the bourbon. 4,500 yen.

4,000.
4,500, I said!

Come on.
You don’t have to buy it.

Okay.

You drink too much.
Is Harper any good?

Sit down.

Good morning.

Aoki?
Here.

Iida?
Here.

Ishioka?

Ishioka?

Ueno?
Here.

Oikawa?
Here.

Kushimori?
Here.

Sato?
Here.

Shinozaki?
Here.

Shimizu?
Here.

Kushimori, what were you
day-dreaming about in class?

Nothing.
You just sat there and stared.

I just have a headache.

You've been drinking too much.

Look at the board, not at me.

Do you know why Ishioka
has stopped coming to school?

No.
You don't?

No. Why?

I heard...

...you got him so upset
that he hit his parents and his brother.

That's not true.
But he did hit them.

What's wrong with that?

If people won't listen,
you have to use force.

You have to draw the line somewhere.

Take it easy. I just want to know
what happened to Ishioka.

Don't get so upset.
Fuck off!

You probably don't even realize it...

Sometimes he just gets this smile
on his face.

There! If you keep smiling like that,
people will think you're a psychopath.

People get suspicious
if you’re 17 and smile funny.

I don't stab people
just because I feel like it.

That's not thinking about the future.
It's like dogs fucking on the road.

It's a lack of imagination.

Dogs lack imagination?

Would you want to be a dog?

Anyway, murder requires imagination.

Imagination?

Yeah, imagination.

Look.

I screwed up.
Daimon's been watching me in class.

I have to be more careful.

Dogs don’t have imagination.

It's the same thing
with cats and sheep.

That's why they don’t brood,
get depressed, and hang themselves.

I'm not losing my imagination.

I have a lot of things to do
before I hang myself.

How do I get rid of that asshole?
Do I burn the house down?

Maybe I can make it look like
he got run over in an accident.

I have to think of something.

How do I save my family?

Think, think, think!

Dressing?
Thanks.

Shuichi, have some vegetables.

I'll have some more.
It'll just make you fatter.

Shut up.

I'll help you eat.
Stop it!

Listen to him!

Stop it.
I'll eat some...

Do you want dinner?

Sake.

Okay... Sure.

Where did that come from?
Did you buy it for him?

You must have.
Nobody else here drinks shochu.

Is he paying you for it?

Why do you do that?
Why not?

What's he doing here?
He's not our concern anymore!

Where else would he go?

Don’t tell me he's moving back in.

No, he's not.
Then get rid of him!

He’ll find a place soon.
Do you really believe that?

Do something.
Stop it!

Can you hear that sound?

Mom and Haruka are probably in bed
with their hands over their ears.

I'm the only one
who can get rid of him.

I'm sorry you had to wait.

Kushimori Shuichi. Nice to meet you.

Try to relax. Have a seat.

Pull up a chair.

Sit down.

You told me you had a legal problem.

How do you get rid of someone-

who's moved into your house?

Are you talking about Sone Takashi?

How did you know?

I thought of him when you called.

We don't need tea right now.

He put up such a fight
over the divorce.

He just turned up and moved back in.

Isn’t there a legal way
of getting rid of him?

The court could act
if your mother filed a complaint.

But why did she let him back in?

She wouldn’t have,
not if I had been there.

He just turned up one day
when Haruka...

...my kid sister,
happened to be home by herself.

Are you sure that's just a coincidence?

When did Sone turn up?

Ten days ago.

Has he been there since?
Yes.

I wonder why your mom
hasn’t told him to leave.

I don’t know.

She must be worried about something.

Can you tell me anything
about their divorce?

Anything might be useful.

Your father died in a car accident,
if my memory serves me.

That's right.

Then your mom met Sone.
He seemed nice at first-

but the longer he stayed with you,
the worse he got.

I don't know what his problem is...

...but he drank all the time,
and he hit your mother.

She divorced him
because she was concerned for you.

She told me she was afraid
that he would kill you.

Didn’t he use to beat you up?

I can’t remember.

I just have some vague memories.

Mom talking quietly...

Haruka was still a baby...

Something smelled nice...

But I can’t remember
anything about myself.

I don't know why.

Hi.

Where's Haruka?
She's at a friend's place.

No. He's not back yet.

You're home late.
Where have you been?

Around.

Shopping?

I saw a lawyer.
A lawyer?

Mr. Kano. You know him.

He handled your divorce ten years ago.

I asked him
what we should do about "him".

Mr. Kano told me
he wants to meet you.

Why?
What do you mean?

You have to file a complaint
to get rid of him.

I’ll think about it.
For how long?

Just a little while. Okay?

Not yet.
Why not?

The longer he stays,
the worse off we’ll be.

He might do something to Haruka!

I haven’t forgotten Haruka, or you.

Then why would you let him stay?
I don't get it!

I hope you're not planning
to get back together again.

Quiet, everybody!

Roll call.

Aoki? Lida? Ishioka?
Ishioka's not here.

Ueno? Emoto? And so on...

Okay, work on your paintings.

What's that?
It's a seascape.

What's Doraemon doing in a seascape?

That's not a cat.
It's a cloud, damn it!

What the hell are you doing?

I'm sorry... sucker.

Bastard!

Look what you did! Stupid!

I'm sorry.
Really?

Yes.

Then come with me
to the art-supply store tomorrow.

I don't get it.

Superpowers... on!

No customers.
I've noticed that.

"I wanna go home... "

Then go.
I was just singing.

It's fine. I’ll finish up here.

If you're sure it's okay...

Thanks. Good night.

You can’t wear a face guard
inside the store.

Take the helmet off, Ishioka Takuya.

How did you know it was me?
It wasn’t difficult to figure out.

How are you?
I'm okay. How about you?

My family keeps avoiding me.

I don't really mind-

but they look the other way when
I bump into them in the bathroom.

It's tough in the long run.

I want to get out of there.

I feel like there's no air there.
I can’t breathe.

I want my knife back.
No. Not yet.

Why not? It's expensive.

You’ll just do something foolish again.

I wish something good would happen.

Get yourself something to drink.

Is it okay?
Just one.

Maybe I should start working
in a convenience store, too.

They check, stupid. My treat.

Really?

Thank you.

I'll drop by again.

Didn’t you want art supplies?

What?

Nothing.

Why won’t Ishioka come to school?

I don’t know.
I heard...

...that you told him to hit his family.

Why did you do that?

He had a knife.
He was going to kill them.

What?!

His family never has anytime for him.

His wonderful brother
gets all their attention.

But killing them...?

That's why I took his knife away-

and talked him into just hitting them.

To turn the heat down a bit?
Yeah. Let's change the subject.

There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

Dogs have imagination.
What?

The other day
you told Daimon and Oikawa...

...that they don't.

Stop eavesdropping.

Our dog has nightmares.

They're pretty bad, I think.
He talks in his sleep.

He talks?

"I'm not a dog," he says.
"I'm not a dog?"

"I'm not a dog!"

You looked in your notebook
and stared at me.

Why?

No reason.

I'd drawn a picture of a yawning lion
with long eyelashes.

What?

<i>Report and revision.
First, the report.</i>

<i>I had a date with Noriko today.
I think you could call it a date.</i>

<i>She's not as stuck-up
as everyone says.</i>

<i>Revision...</i>

Dogs may have imagination.

"I'm not a dog... "

Can’t you say hi to your own dad?

No. Stop it!

Shuichi!

Let go! What are you doing?

What's all this shouting?
Keep your hands off Haruka!

Keep your hands off her!

Shut up, you brat!

You're the one
who's all over her all the time.

You've got your eye
on her yourself, right? Don’t you?

Son of a bitch!

Why are you waving
that thing around?

Shuichi, don't!

You're all talk.
What are you going to do?

Come on, you bastard!
Shut up!

I mean it.

Stop it! What are you doing?

What's wrong with you?

Stop it!

You promised!

I'm not the one who started this.
He came running and screamed at me.

Take this.

Cut it out now.

Shuichi?

Can I come in?

There's something
I really have to tell you.

Are you listening?

I know it’s not good for us
to have Sone staying here.

But there’s a problem.

Haruka came here with Sone.
She's not really your sister.

When we got divorced, I took you
and me off Sone's family register.

But Haruka's still on it,
as his daughter.

I thought about adopting her...

...but they told me I would
have to get permission from Sone.

He refused.

If I make him leave,
he's sure to bring it up.

I don’t want...

...you or Haruka
to get dragged into this.

Haruka will be 15 this spring.

Then she can decide for herself
if she wants me to adopt her-

and become your sister for real.

I'm begging you...

Just hang in there a little longer.

Haruka doesn’t know.

I should have told you.

I'm sorry.

Leave this house.

Do you need money?

<i>...and this produces
vast amounts of energy.</i>

<i>A high-energy particle
transmitted through water-</i>

<i>- produces a blue glow-</i>

<i>- called "Cherenkov light".</i>

<i>This can be seen
with highly radioactive substances-</i>

<i>- like spent nuclear fuel.</i>

<i>Radioactive phenomena
are considered very dangerous-</i>

<i>- but they occur in nature

<i>I'll get rid of this intruder
who's threatening my family.</i>

<i>Matsuoka Shiro... will be my name.
A new me.</i>

Mr. Matsuoka Shiro...

<i>You can be anonymous
on the Internet.</i>

<i>I'll do a search on things
like medicine and juvenile crime-</i>

<i>- and look at underground sites.</i>

<i>"Aqueous cyanide... "
This looks interesting.</i>

<i>"Feels like a bad hangover. "</i>

<i>I can use this to knock him out...</i>

<i>...and he won't have his way anymore.</i>

<i>Matsuoka Shiro, at a PO box address.</i>

<i>This way I won't leave a trace.</i>

<i>I'm Matsuoka Shiro.</i>

<i>The drug comes to his PO box.</i>

<i>But Matsuoka Shiro doesn't exist.</i>

<i>You can't see him, you can't hear him.</i>

<i>My tape recorder,
the thing that records me-</i>

<i>- turns my pain into words.</i>

<i>My words... The secret story

<i>Proof... "The perfect crime. "
What is that?</i>

<i>I have the poison.
Let the experiment begin.</i>

<i>I'll put some in his shochu.</i>

<i>I'll use a title at first, and then
I'll gradually increase the dose.</i>

<i>I can weaken his body that way.</i>

<i>The decision has been made.</i>

<i>It's easy.</i>

<i>I just have to close my eyes-</i>

<i>- and wait
for the inevitable to happen.</i>

<i>Now there’s just the question
of what I'll actually kill him with.</i>

Shuichi...

You hid something.
It's a dirty book!

Don't come in here.

Put a shirt on.

There's a lady present.

What do you want?

I just wondered what you were doing
cooped up in here all the time.

Mom's worried.

Mind your own business.
Get out, or I’ll take off all my clothes.

Go ahead.

What does this mean?
What?

It's an electrical formula.
You wouldn’t understand it.

I'm not stupid!

Bye.

"The Joule effect... "

"The creation of heat... "

Electrocution

Hello.
I'll have these.

That's 5,000 yen.

I got it!

The shochu you wanted.

Do you know how hard it was
to get it out of the store?

Fine. I'll pay you what it’s worth.

But you drink bourbon.

Why do you want shochu?

Can I come in?

No.

I'm reading a dirty book.

Dinner's ready.

I'll be right there.

No one would ever suspect
that these were the tools of murder.

It's simple-
that way it won't attract attention.

The law books really helped.

They told me who I will be up against.

This is basically a test of imagination.

Do I have to go through with it?

I guess so.

I may have nightmares every night
starting tomorrow.

Maybe I'll talkin my sleep,
just like Noriko's dog.

"I'm not human... "

There are some things
you can’t laugh about.

Good morning.
Where's your bike?

It's a road racer.
Anyway, I took the train.

Were we on the same train?

Yes.

I didn't see you.

Roll call.

Grade 11A?

Good.

Where are you going?

Outside.

Finally! Where have you been?

I told you I was painting outside.

You got a lot of work done.
Yeah...

Aren’t you going to eat?
I'm not really hungry.

Did you report this?
Yes.

Why don’t you tell me what happened?

Shuichi? How many people
are there in your family?

Three. There's me,
my mom, and my kid sister.

And your dad.
No...

My dad died in a car accident
when I was younger.

Then who died here today?

Sone Takashi.

My mom married him,
and then they got divorced.

Did he stay here after the divorce?

No. He just turned up
and moved back in.

He moved back in with you?

Where's your mom now?

She works in a friend's
decorating store.

While you and your sister
were in school today-

was Sone here by himself?

As far as I know.

This blood-pressure monitor
keeps a record.

You turn it on...
I have one just like it.

Have you ever seen one of these?

I think it's my mom's.

Shuichi!

What's happened?

Mom...

Sone's dead.

Dead?!

What happened?

I don’t know.

My name’s Yamamoto.

Can I ask you some questions?

Is this your blood-pressure monitor?

Yes, that's mine.

We found it in Sone's room.
Did you lend it to him?

No.
You didn't?

The monitor keeps a record
of every test.

I know that for a fact.
I have one of these myself.

Look at this.

That's not my blood-pressure.
And I was at work.

Maybe Sone took
his own blood-pressure?

I guess so.

I see.

Excuse me.

You're dripping.

What? Oh.

You're still up...

I'm still wide awake.

I haven’t been feeling well-

ever since Sone turned up
and made things difficult for us.

I know it’s been hard on you.
I just want to...

He's dead.

It's over.

Shuichi...

...just tell me one thing.

The police told me you took
the train to school today.

I did?

Maybe I did.

I can’t remember.

You can't?

Why do you ask?

I'm going to bed.
You should do the same.

You're right. I will. Good night.

Good night.

I'm not a dog

Where are you going with that?
I’ll finish it at home.

Why can’t you finish it here?

It shouldn’t matter where I do it.

The police called.

He died of natural causes.
They want us to pick up the body.

Mom, we're eating.

Time's up. Pass your papers forward.

Where's your umbrella?

Somebody took it.
Really? That's too bad.

Did you bring your bike?
It's a road racer! Here.

Thanks.
It was raining this morning.

You've been acting strange lately.

In what way?

You never come to Art Club...
You've been skipping out on that, too.

I had to today.
There's something wrong with my dog.

I told you about him.
He talks in his sleep.

I remember that.

Can I ask you something?
What?

Where did you go to
during art class the other day?

I went outside. The weather was nice.

You're lying.

I went outside, but you weren't there.

Question number two:

Why was your painting dry
when you got back?

It was?
Yes.

I don’t remember that.

Question number three: Have you
looked at your painting recently?

No.

You should.
Especially on a rainy day like this.

Why?
You might want to think about that.

Thanks for the umbrella.
See you later. Get going.

You again...
Can't I come in here?

I need a favor from you.
You're not getting your knife back.

That's not it. I need to
borrow some money from you.

Money?
I need 300,000 yen.

You're out of your mind.

You shouldn’t be so quick to say no...

...to someone who knows your secret.

Secret?

Don’t play dumb with me... "Dad-killer".

I saw you close to the school that day.

I followed you on my motorbike.

You didn't see me.

You went home, came back out again,
and then you hid your little toy.

So you're the one who took it...
Yeah, I'll exchange it for my knife.

I didn't know what it was for at first.

Then I heard that your old man
had died from a heart attack-

and that’s when I pieced it together.

Do you want me to go on?

What's so funny?
Do you find me amusing?

It's always pissed me off
how you think you're so damn smart...

You think you know everything,
and that the rest of us are stupid.

You only help people
so you can feel superior to them.

Don’t think I won't do anything.

You killed your old man in cold blood.

What happens when you're like me,
gasping for breath...

...and begging for help?

300,000?
Yeah.

All right.

But I don’t have it now.
I need some time.

How much time?
A week.

Fine, a week. But don't try to run.

Where would I run?

I have nowhere to go.

No juice today?

No. I shouldn’t take advantage of you.

Shuichi? I'm coming in.

Are you hiding again?

You can't just barge in here.
I've told you that.

Mom will be home late.
I'm making dinner.

What do you want?

An ostrich-egg omelet.
You got it.

Well? Go find me an ostrich.

Is it true
that I'm not really your sister?

Who told you that?

He did- Sone Takashi.

That's bullshit.
You don’t believe him, do you?

Do you remember the night
I went to the bathroom-

and he was out in the hallway?

He told me that night-

that I was his daughter
and that he was dying of cancer.

He had come back to see me.

Cancer? He told you that?

Why didn’t you tell me?

I'm sorry.

Is it true
that I'm not really your sister?

You're my baby sister.

Stop worrying.

Hurry up and get dinner ready.
Chicken eggs will be fine.

I'll be right back.

He had cancer...
He would have died anyway.

I'm such an idiot.

Well?
I don’t have it yet.

What? You asked me to wait a week,
and I did.

I've thought of a way to get it.

A robbery.

A robbery?
What are you going to rob?

Not me-you.

Hang on.
I'm the one blackmailing you.

Why should I commit a robbery?

You'll rob my convenience store.
I'll be the only one there.

You're kidding.

We'll both be in on it. Don’t worry.

But they’ve got cameras.

The picture quality is terrible.
They won't be able to identify you.

And you won't go to the cops?

Of course not.

No, I guess not.
You killed your old man.

I'm curious-
how much cash are we talking?

Almost a million yen, I think.
Really?!

Did you see his bones?
No.

You didn't? I'm sorry.

I guess we'll all end up
as nothing but bones.

How would you like it if your bones
were on displayin a hundred years?

That would be embarrassing.

Say something.
You remember what I said?

Yeah. I'll call you if the plan changes.

Can I use this knife?
No.

Use this one.

That's my knife. I'm not using that!

It's a copy. I've made it.

No shit?
Don’t touch the blade!

Keep it in the sheath
until it's time to use it.

Wow! It looks just like the real one.

Put it away, you moron!

It's a good thing it's the store's money
and not yours.

Cheer up. I'll get it right.

Save your sympathy.
I'm sorry.

When I get the money,
I'll be able to get my own place.

Free at last, thanks to you.

Let's get some dinner.

I have to work.

Tonight, too?

I'll check out the place,
so we know it'll work.

You'll be up all night.
I can't sleep anyway.

Wake up, Haruka. This isn’t your room.

Did you kill him?

Yeah, I killed him.

That's what I thought.

Hello.

The money.

Give me the money. Now!

Hurry up!

How am I doing?
Shut up.

Give me the money!

You bastard!

What?

Let go!

This isn't how we planned it.

Let go!

Shuichi...

Why?

Why?

Get lost!

Get out of here!

You’ll feel better.

Can't eat?

So we meet again...

First Mr. Sone, and now this robber.

Take this, please.

You've had it rough.

Let me get this clear...

When did you realize
that it was Ishioka Takuya?

When his helmet came off.

When he was on the floor.

That's not what you said
when you called the police.

Why didn’t you say
that you knew him?

I really don’t know.
I couldn’t think straight.

I see.

I can understand that.

That's it for tonight.
You must be tired.

But I'll want to talk to you tomorrow.

Can I go?
Yes.

Can I try that?

Do you think you can do it?
Sure.

I've always wanted to try it.

Don’t fall.
I'll be fine.

You're not very athletic.
Can you put your feet down?

Take it easy.

Did you sleep well?
Not really.

Come in and have a seat.

We'll get this over with
as soon as possible.

To be frank-

I think it's odd
that you and Ishioka were classmates.

Do you think we planned this?
No, I doubt it.

This probably wouldn’t
have happened then.

You knew there wasn't
much money in the store.

I want to show you something.

Do you notice anything strange?

Not really.

Ishioka comes into the store
and walks right over to you.

A person who's about
to rob the place-

would look around to see
if there are any customers around.

A customer could be a problem.

We almost never have customers
at that hour.

That's right,
but how did Ishioka know that?

I don’t know, but apparently he did.

"Apparently he did... "

There!

It looks like the knife was up
against your neck. Was it?

I really don’t remember.

Look at it! It looks like he's
pressing it against your neck.

But you don’t have a mark on you.

I don’t think
it was actually on my neck.

Probably not. It wasn’t a toy, was it?

You're very brave.

Most people wouldn't dare
take on someone with a knife.

Watch closely.

His feet aren’t moving here.
Then they start twitching.

Now they move less and less...

...and here they stop moving.

Isn’t that odd?
What?

I thought the knife went into Ishioka
when you both fell.

But after looking at the tape,
I think I may have been wrong.

I don't understand what you mean.

Right after he falls...

...his feet aren’t moving
as if he’d been stabbed.

Then they freeze and start twitching.

The logical assumption here would be-

that his feet froze
right as the knife went in.

What do you mean?

Do you think I took the knife from him
and used it to kill him?

Even it that were true,
it would still be self-defense.

That's crazy.

How would I have been able
to get the knife away from him-

without getting
so much as a scratch?

You're quite right.

But there are too many holes
in your story.

For one thing, we didn’t find a sheath.

It's a sharp, doubled-edged knife.
He wouldn't carry it around like that.

Would he?

And we found a folding knife
in his back pocket.

Don’t you find it weird
that he brought two knifes-

to rob a convenience store?

Cool bike!

It's not a bike, it's a road racer.

It's really nice.

Can I try it?

Sure.

It's so light.

You lean forward...

Kushimori.

Come here.

I was going
to drop by your house later.

I thought you'd take the day off.

Have a seat.

You didn’t have to show up today.

Why should I miss school?

Why should I miss school? Answer me!

Kushimori! Watch it.

Mr. Inukai's not making any sense.

Is that anyway to talk to a teacher?

Think about it.
What should I think about?

One of your classmates is dead, and...

And it's my fault?
Maybe not in a legal sense...

But in a moral sense?
I didn't say that!

Please, Mr. Konaka...

It must’ve been hard on him.

He tried to kill me!
Do you want me to feel sorry for him?

I don't think he wanted to kill you.
He was just after the money.

Did Ishioka talk about this
with any of you?

What?!

Then how do you know
what he meant to do?!

Ishioka Takuya came into the store
where I was working.

He pulled out a knife
and demanded money.

We struggled, he fell,
the knife went in, and he died.

There's no reason
I shouldn’t be in school.

Excuse me.

I'm sorry I raised my voice.
I'll get to class.

I haven't seen you
in the Art Club room for a while.

Are you leaving already?

He died.
What?

My dog. Early this morning.
Yeah?

I didn’t hear the last words
he said in his sleep.

Screw Art Club. Let's get out of here.

Have a seat.

Tell me about your dog.

Like what?
Anything.

Sometimes he talked in his sleep.

I know that. What else?

He was hairier than me.

I figured that.

I'm actually being serious.

I just can't put it into words.

I don't want to remember his color
or how big he was.

I don’t want to be
like some TV digest-

Looking back
on all the superficial details.

He'd gone cold this morning.
That's what I thought then.

Do you think it’s silly?

How did he die?

Do you really want to know?

What's this?

The parts to my old road racer.

So it comes apart like that,
piece by piece?

Cool.

It makes it look
like the bike hanged itself.

What?

I should be going home.

Hang on! You just go there.
Have a cup of tea at least.

No, thanks. See you.

Don't go!
Let go of me.

Are you that scared of me?

If you are, then say so!

Just go!

Get out of here.

<i>- Favorite things?
Yeah, anything.</i>

<i>I write it down when I think of it.</i>

<i>- Like what?
Like...</i>

<i>No, I'm not telling you.
You won’t tell me anything important.</i>

<i>But if you write it down,
it's amazing how calm you get.</i>

<i>What if you can’t think of anything?</i>

<i>Write a list of things you hate,
and then burn it.</i>

See you.

I...

...have killed someone.

I see.

When Sone died
and I first talked to Shuichi-

I assumed
that he was Shuichi's father.

When I mentioned that,
he firmly denied it.

That was something that struck me.

When Sone came back
and wanted to live with you...

...why did you let him in?

Shuichi's liked drawing
ever since he was little.

He would draw pictures
of Haruka and me.

One time he drew a picture of Sone-

with his head inside a lion's mouth.

He said the lion had a bad tooth
and that Sone was pulling it out.

It was the only time
he drew a picture of Sone-

and the first time he lied to me.

I shouldn’t have let Sone in.

I knew that...

...but it just happened.

My brother’s busy.
Can you come back later?

Fine, I'll come.
Ignore them!

Don’t worry. I'll be right back.

I'll call Mom.
Haruka!

Please don't do that.

No, Shuichi. Don't go!

It's fine. I'll be right back.

Do your homework.

Shuichi!
Let's go.

Shuichi!

The day that Sone died,
you left your art class.

<i>Sone was completely wasted,
and you electrocuted him.</i>

<i>You used the blood-pressure monitor
to check-</i>

<i>- but the heat loosened
a crown from Mr. Sone's teeth.</i>

<i>We found the transformer and
the wire you used at Ishioka's home.</i>

Maybe Ishioka found out
and threatened to expose you.

<i>You would've had to shut him up.</i>

Shouldn’t you just come clean?

All right.
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

This is the police
you're talking to, kid!

Why tomorrow?

So I can say goodbye to my friends.

If that's okay...

All right...
You promise you'll come back?

Yes.
All right.

I'll trust you.

Tomorrow. I'll be waiting here.

So...

Did you buy one?

That road racer. Did you buy it?

Yes, I actually did. How did you know?

I saw you on the beach.

You did?

Did you see me?

They're expensive!

I almost fainted
when I found out how much they cost.

I had promised to buy
a game machine for my kids-

but I couldn't resist it.

Why not?

That's a good question.

I wanted to understand you better.

This yogurt is good.
It is?

It's really nice- kiwi and orange.

Are you going out?
Just for a while.

He's meeting a girl.
A girl?

Her name is Noriko.
How did you know that?

I heard you talking on the phone.
You're just jealous.

Get going.
Jerk!

Will you be back for lunch?

I think so.

What do you want?

You decide.

But I wanted
to make you something special.

I'm sorry. I'm going.

Bye.

Haruka, I'm going.
What are you mad at, stupid?

I'm not stupid!

You're early.
So are you.

I wanted to finish this picture.

What is it?
You in 30 years.

In 30 years? I'll be 47 by then.

What will you be like?

I'll probably have
more flesh under my jaw.

I'll have wrinkles
and may even be bald.

And a pot-belly?
Yeah, a typical middle-aged fart.

With smelly feet.
Don't overdo it.

That cop was asking
all kinds of questions about you.

I know.

I was in the schoolyard
when we had art class.

You saw me through the window
and came out to talk to me.

Is that what you said?
Pretty much.

Why did you lie?
I wasn't trying to help you.

I just didn't like that cop's face.

Daimon and Oikawa lied to him, too.

But the cop said
that their stories didn't add up.

They didn't like his face, either.

Neither do I,
but he seems pretty smart.

He'll probably get me.

Did you really kill them?

I can’t think of anyone
that I would want to kill.

But I guess people
get caught up in situations-

where they're forced to kill.

You said you wanted to meet me.
Yeah.

I wanted to say goodbye.
Goodbye?

If I get arrested, it'll be big news.

I don’t want to cause trouble
for Mom and Haruka.

I don’t want to mess up their future.

It's all right. Don’t worry.

If there's a trial, I'll stick to my story.

Hang in there.

Don't let them get you down.

For your mother's sake,
and your sister's, too.

Thanks.

I should be going.

I'm sorry I dragged you over here.

as I see it from my road racer.</i>
