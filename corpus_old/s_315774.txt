<i>What?</i>

<i>When?</i>

<i>But who is this?</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>No</i>

No! But how can that be?

<i>Okay, okay</i>

<i>Yes</i>

Bye, mommy.

Sleep with the angels.

-Bye, daddy.
-I love you, birdie.

<i>What do you want?</i>
<i>Rafael! Tomás!</i>

<i>We didn't do anything!</i>
<i>We didn't do anything!</i>

Tomás! Get under the bed!
Hurry! Hurry!

<i>Tomás, Rafael!</i>

Children!

What happened!

Oh, my God.

Come in, boys!

<i>I just want a place</i>

<i>where I can live in peace</i>

<i>Underneath the frozen stars</i>

<i>A shining essence</i>

<i>And it is darkness</i>

<i>To watch the sun rise</i>

<i>Search for the source of the soul</i>

<i>Bathe in it every break of day</i>

<i>And when I say sky</i>

<i>I mean sky,</i>

<i>I mean blue skies</i>

-Rafael!
-Laura! What a surprise!

-I’m glad I found you.
-What’s up?

Have you seen Tomás?

No. Is something wrong?

I must see him.
I can’t find him.

I need to talk to you.

Fine. But I have a class now.

-Call me later.
-I’ll wait for you.

-Where?
-Here.

-It’ll be two hours.
-It doesn’t matter.

Come in.

Good morning.

We’ll continue...

analyzing Saint Thomas’ philosophy.

I hope you’ve read the texts.

-Any questions?
-No.

These truths revealed by faith...

and attainable through
the use of reason...

Saint Thomas calls them
“preambula fide”,

or gateways to faith.

But with respect to the
nondemonstrable Saint Thomas says:

“Salvation also depends on truths
that transcend reason...

and can only be reached...

through revelation”.
And to finish...

“The infinite nature of God...

is unattainable through reason,
because the finite...

cannot adequately
understand the infinite”.

Sir?

I have a question.
Maybe out of line.

Do you believe in God?

We’d have to define
what we mean by “God”.

I’ll rephrase that.

Within the context
of your teaching,

do you think that the cosmos
happens accidentally...

or that there’s an order, a higher
structure which makes it a whole?

That’s an interesting question.

But this is a Medieval...

Philosophy History class.

And I don’t think it matters
what I believe.

Nonetheless let’s say...

there is a school of sophisticated
and mature thinkers...

who suggest that such a question...

would denote a certain kind
of educational immaturity.

Couldn’t it be the opposite?
Couldn’t others think differently?

No, it doesn’t work like that.

Excuse me.

I was talking about coherence,
about exemplars.

To have a serious discussion...

we should agree
on some concepts.

It’s easy. If you tell
your child not to steal,

but he sees you stealing,
what’ll he do?

-I don’t know.
-Will you teach him...

what you are
or what you say you are?

I don’t have children.

-Thanks.
-Don’t mention it.

Shall we go?

You leave later every day.

I tell myself
“just one more minute.”

Meditate after work.

But at this time
the mind is so calm...

-There are bills to pay.
-Do you have any money?

-Yes.
-Show it to me.

Show what?
Don’t be rude.

Don’t lie to me.

You have no money.

-You’ll get paid on Monday
-But it’s Friday.

Don’t worry about me.
I’ll have some soup.

I worry about you.
You’re still growing.

I’ll ask for an advance.

Mendizabal Cereals.
Can I...?

Oh, it’s you.
Hold on.

-Rama, you have to go out.
-I’m just finishing.

I’ll finish it.
Come here, please.

Hang on a minute.

Francés Bank, Nación Bank,
tax office,

and go get Mr. Walter’s CDI.
Everything’s there.

Don’t lose anything
and don’t be late.

-Can I see Walter later on?
-Mr.

-Mr. Walter.
-What do you want?

-Something.
-What something?

A wonderful thing.

-Urgent.
-Later.

I’m sick of him.

I don’t know where to begin.

Generally, it’s good to begin
from the beginning.

It’s not that easy.

You don’t know your brother.

Am I disturbing you?

Banks, tax office, receipts,
there you are.

What is it?

-You took too long.
-It’s Friday.

-I have to report it.
-What?

I have no choice.

I just stopped for a minute.

Don’t shout at me!

I’m not shouting.
I’m sorry if you felt...

I didn’t feel so.
You shouted at me.

-Can I talk to Walter?
-Mr. Walter?

Yes. Mr. Walter.

No, he’s busy.
Can I help you?

-No.
-See you tomorrow.

See you on Monday.

Drink, drink, drink!

I love you.

-Up to the sky? And back?
-And back.

Thanks a lot to “Club 69”!

A big hand!

On this night
of grace and abundance...

we’re in the hands of...
Power DJ!

You do know him,
but not well enough.

Because...

you think that he’s naive,

that he is an idiot,
and it’s not so.

What’s happening to him
is intense.

-What do you mean?
-His sensitivity.

Your brother
isn’t an ordinary person.

-Maybe.
-I mean...

the dimension of his search.
It isn’t normal.

He’s searching for his father.

The dimension and intensity
of his search is proportional...

to the violence
with which they took him

Was your father
an extremist, too?

In those days,

if you were going against murdering,
you were an “extremist”.

I didn’t mean that.

How did he manage his affairs?
What was he like?

Just normal. He was a Buddhist,
but he was a normal guy.

He worked, he had a family
he loved, my mother and us.

He was very religious,
but you never noticed it.

I don’t know
what you’re getting at.

This situation is frightening me.

-What has you so scared?
-That he’ll go away. I don’t know.

Go where?

Your brother could die
in that bullshit posture!

God! God has forgiven us.
In his mercy, he’s looked upon us.

Tonight we welcome
a band of monks. Zen monks.

I don’t know
where they come from.

Right here, in “The Cave”,
I am delighted to present...

the Zen monk, Herman,
and his band, “No Satori”.

-Who are you?
-Laila.

Hi.

There’s someone there.

Tom.

Tom. Are you okay?

Ten pesos.

-Tomás?
-Give me ten pesos, please.

Give me ten pesos, please.

Don’t get upset.
I don’t understand you.

I’m trying really hard.

-What is it you don’t understand?
-This is a waste of time.

What’s up?

-Help me, please.
-But you must tell me...

I need your help.

What the fuck is going on?

And in the house
where they gave him food,

they also planted seeds.

And he walked and walked
and soon he was older.

One day he got to the sea.
And he had to stop there.

You can’t walk on the sea.

-Hello.
-Hi.

-Where shall I put it?
-Back there.

I have to charge you for it.

-What did Gerardo say?
-He said no more than five...

or I’ll have to pay for it.

Hold on, hold on.

Don’t go. Here.

You know what?
I’ll charge you eight. I’ll pay two.

You’re a fine person.

Let’s go, princess.

I don’t believe a word you say.
I don’t believe you.

Look at me. I’m a nice guy.

-No.
-Just a little bit.

You know what that is?

-A stolen kiss.
-No way!

-Mom.
-How are you?

-Fine.
-How did it go with Carlos?

You go out with the most sought
after hunk in Argentina...

-and you’re not gonna tell me?
-No.

You’re still hung up on that kid.
He’s no good.

What are you talking about?

You’re always suffering.

You see?
We can’t live together.

You see?
-He’s kind of... silly.

Where is he an office boy?
He was just here.

-What? Who?
-Tobías.

-Why didn’t you tell me?
-I’m telling you now.

-What did he say?
-What would he say? Nothing.

-Tomás!
-Not again!

Hi! What’s wrong?

What is it?

Tell me.
What’s up with you?

It’s not easy to be with him.
It’s hard to be with someone...

who doesn’t talk,
who doesn’t like to go out,

or to go dancing,
who doesn’t like sex.

Nothing, you know?

He reads one book. Only one.
And all he wants to do...

is talk about God constantly.

I love him, but it isn’t easy.

But if he saw you with that guy
it’s normal to not want to see you.

-But if you saw you with that guy...
-That’s not it.

-He saw you with another guy!
-It's something else. I know!

His phone’s cut off.

Cut off? Where is he?

I don't know!

-Have you got the bills?
-No.

You see? Here.

-You’re very worried.
-I’ll get paid today.

Buy some clothes...

some paints, a canvas...
You like painting.

Go on, Tomás.
Enjoy yourself for once.

The decision’s already been made.

I live alone with my grandma.
I support her.

Do you live alone
or with your grandma?

-I live with my grandma.
-I’m really sorry.

You should’ve
thought of that before.

What? What should I have thought?
What do you mean?

Shall I call security?

It’s okay.

-Thank you.
-Don’t mention it.

He went neither to the funeral
nor to the cremation.

He told me...

she wasn’t there anymore and
a few other stupid things.

And he left it all to me,
as always.

You don’t see it.

You really don’t see it.

Tomás is a saint.

Your brother’s a Buddha.

So what’s he doing
in this neighbourhood?

You know what?
I just can’t do this.

Look at the state you’re in.
You’re not OK.

I’ll try to find him. I’ll call you
tomorrow or the next day.

Find him!

-Professor Rama? Professor Rama?
-Yes.

How are you?
Do you have a minute?

-No. But go ahead.
-I’m an editor...

for Longseller.
I’d like to publish your book...

on postmodernism and ecology.

If that’s okay with you.

If you have a minute,
I’ll tell you about it.

I’m busy now, but what was
the name of the publisher?

Longseller,
an important publisher.

Does it specialize
n Philosophy?

Not exactly.

But it has circulation
in Europe, Latin America...

I’ll leave you this brochure...

and my card. And if you want you
can call me and I’ll fill you in.

-Okay.
-Great.

<i>Tomás! Tomás! Tomás!</i>

<i>Get under the bed Hurry!</i>.

Tomás!

Tomás!

-Hello. You’re...
-Yes.

-How are you?
-Fine, fine.

Do you know if Tomás is in?

-Doesn’t he answer?
-No.

Maybe he knows you’re calling,

and he doesn’t want to let you in.
What’s your name?

-Rafael. I’m his brother.
-Yes, I know.

You’re a good man.
But you’re a real asshole.

I really need to see him.

Can you open the door for me?

-Do you think he is dead?
-What? No.

It’s all right. Come in.
You’re a good man.

You can fix the asshole part.

Maybe. I’m not so sure myself.

Thanks.

Laura called by yesterday.

How long have you been here?
Like this?

I don’t know. Awhile.

-What are you gonna do?
-With what?

With your life.

Not run away anymore.

I mean for a living.

I don’t care.

I can’t believe...

I’m asking you this.
I can’t believe it.

Shall we go for a walk?

For a walk? It’s 3A.M.

Come on.
You...You’re good, man.

What did you hear?

Are you afraid of madness?

Not usually. A little today.

-You?
-I always was, but not anymore.

-Isn’t this dangerous?
-No.

Are you eating well?

How can I tell you?

Tell me what?
Are you eating or aren’t you?

Can you understand
the benefit of fasting?

You’re not in Tibet,
this is Buenos Aires.

You were born
and educated here.

You were fed in a normal way.

You just can’t cut off the supply.

It’s not about eating or not.

There are other sources.

Stop fucking around, Tomás!

Electricity has been cut off?

Don’t “sources” tell you maybe
you’re a little mistaken?

I never knew such calm.

Such sweetness.

I look at you
and I see you going under.

The monkey sees the fish
in the water and suffers.

He thinks his world is the only one.

The real one. The best.

He suffers because he’s good
and feels compassion.

He sees the fish and says:
“It’s drowning”.

“It can’t breathe”.

He takes it out of the water
and thinks: “I’ve saved it”.

But the fish
writhes in pain and dies.

That’s why I showed you the dream.

You can’t put the sea
into your head.

It’s a bucket.

I don’t feel well.

I don’t feel well at all.

-Did you hear that?
-What?

They must be injured!

Fucking hell!

Look what you’ve done!

Are you blind? You’re blind!

Are you the king of the road?

-Son of a bitch!
-Come here, you asshole!

Stop! Stop!

-Look at your little girl.
-That’s my car.

-Exchange insurance data.
-Insurance my ass!

Aren't you insured?

-How are you?
-Hello.

Take a seat, please.

-Everything okay?
-Yes. And you?

Fine. I’m happy.

-Tea or coffee?
-Coffee.

Coffee for him, tea for me.

-Are you Rafael Rama?
-Yes.

I’m doing a paper
on your thesis.

I loved it. And also
your essay on Spinoza.

-Great.
-You know why I liked it?

-It doesn’t matter.
-It was so simply put.

You get right
to the heart of it.

It’s a great pleasure to meet you.
Thank you.

-Thank you.
-Sorry. I’ll be right back.

-Sorry.
-It’s fine.

-It’s a good sign.
-What?

That someone, out of the blue,
confirms my offer.

Not out of the blue.
She studies here, at the university.

-What’s your offer?
-Yes.

It’s been accepted
by the management.

I just need your consent.

-It’s not so bad.
-It’s very good.

A little New Age.
The publisher, I mean.

It covers a lot.
It’s a big company.

Today there’s a presentation...

of our primary cultures collection.

We’re launching the Tobas texts.
If you’d like to go...

Well, let me think it over.

-Okay.
-Okay.

-Thanks.
-No, thank you. It was a pleasure.

-I’ll try to come this evening.
-Great.

-Bye.
-Thanks.

Don’t be rude, Laura.
Answer the phone.

Lucy, Lucy, don’t worry, it’s OK.

Yes, I’ll put heron now.

He knows you’re here.
You can’t do this to me.

-Carlos.
-Laura! How are you, princess?

Listen. I don’t want to be rude,

but I’m not interested in you.

My mother insists but it all
seems very stupid to me.

Thank you for being so chivalrous
but this is a waste of time.

I have to go now.
Thanks for listening. Bye.

Open up, Tom.
Please, open.

-Hello.
-Excuse me.

-Can I ask you something?
-Of course.

-You live next to Tomás, right?
-Yes, I do.

-Have you seen him?
-Not for some time.

When did you last see him?

I don’t know.
Three weeks ago.

Thank you.

-No. It was my pleasure.
-Thanks.

He’s left me.
Hasn’t he?

I think this goes
way behind you.

He’s in a bad way. It’s serious.
He’s very week.

We shouldn’t panic but he’s going
to need psychiatric help.

We should see how we stand legally.

-Legally?
-To get him out...

Legally nothing.
That’s got nothing to do with it.

-Really?
-Not legally.

And what shall I do?
Let him die?

He’s my only family.

He knows what he’s doing.

He hasn’t eaten in two weeks.

-It’s not the first time.
-Does no one ever tell me anything?

Has he never gone
into your dreams?

He told me once about a dream,
but it was a coincidence.

He’s always doing it.

What’s the point of it all?

Liberation.
To escape rebirth.

He says being conscious
of the reality of God...

is the result of many
disciplined lives.

I’m sorry, but what you’re saying
is embarrassing.

Such an extreme search,
so many disciplined lives,

but he can’t manage
basic social interaction.

Isn’t it a bit absurd?

You don’t understand,
yet you judge?

Do you think everything
can be turned into a parking lot?

That’s not so.

Listen. I’m very late for...

Don’t worry, I’m going. But I want
to ask you something important.

Open your heart, Rafael.
And give him time.

-Laila?
-They’re about to start.

I’m looking for...

-First time?
-Yes.

On the cushion.

It’s the story of our chief...

Metzoboché.

He wasn’t just an ordinary person.

He spoke to the lightning,
to the wind...

-Hello. Sol Blanc?
-I think she’s left.

But have a look in the back.

Thanks.

<i>.so people know about him</i>

<i>An unforgettable story for us</i>

Count on us
for any help we can give you...

and I thank you deeply.

Thank you, Clemente.
Thank you.

-I’m so tired.
-Great.

-Yes, really great. I’m happy.
-Have you eaten?

-No.
-Can I invite you to dinner?

We can cook something...

in my house.

-Okay.
-Thanks. Really, I’m about to drop.

Come on, this way.

Did you want to ask me something?
-Yes. I’m looking for Laila.

Laila? She went to the temple.

-The temple?
-Yes. She went to see the Master.

-Are you OK? Do you feel all right?
-Yes.

Why philosophy?

Well, my mother in part...

My brain came preprogrammed.

And then, the search
for the truth, for the self,

what it is, what it isn’t...

Everything that begins to mean less
as the years go by.

And you?

For the work.

And to find some professor,
publish his work...

If he’s good looking,
all the better.

The sauce is burning.

-Do you want your glass?
-Okay.

Here.

-Maradona?
-A Hindu saint.

He’s an incarnation
of the divine.

He refers to himself as divine?

He says we are all divine.

-Great.
-Give everything, take nothing,

serve everyone, be nothing.

-How sophisticated.
-No.

-You’re strange.
-Why?

Those preachers are normally...

for simple minds.
I don’t know...

Artaud, Baudelaire,
Nouvelle Vague and Sai Baba don’t...

So wide ranging, so open.

It’s not all about the mind.

-No?
-No.

What else is it all about?

Sometimes the heart,
sometimes the body.

Have you ever been
in the presence of a great Master?

Yes. I had one once.
A chess master.

When I was seventeen.
A great master.

Why? You’ve been to India?

Yes, I’ve been there.

That’s the problem between
Western and Eastern philosophies.

What’s the problem?

That Western philosophy
is theory...

without practice.

For example, a man can teach virtue
and live in vice.

Or teach Ethics...

but be a corrupt swindler,

and no one can say he isn’t
a great theorist.

And theorists
constantly regurgitate...

what others said
about criticisms of others.

Eastern philosophy
is based on practice.

It’s born in the doing.
It’s practical and coherent.

It doesn’t fill books
explaining the scent of a rose.

It tells you where to find it,
smell it, and figure it out.

I think...

you have an unbalanced view
of both sides.

You omit historical facts...

that can’t be dismissed.

-Like what?
-Like the constant genocides...

carried out in the name of God.

That’s the stupidity
and brutality of man.

You’re identifying divine energy
with the church.

-They’re totally different.
-And where is divine energy?

Christians who kill Moslems.

Moslem who kill Jews.
Jews who kill Palestinians.

Hindus starving to death.
Is that your Eastern coherence?

We’re talking
about different things.

I’m sorry.

But I’m sick
of spirituality and mysticism.

The military dictatorship
took and murdered my parents.

And I’ve always wondered...
where was God?

Where was God
when they took them...

in front of
my four-year old brother?

There is no concept in the universe
that seems more abhorrent,

deceptive and deliberately
created to cheat people...

than the concept
and the idea of God.

Excuse me.

I’m sorry.

I’m leaving.
