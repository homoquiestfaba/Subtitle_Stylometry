Margaret.

Margaret.

Margaret.

Yes?

You should get some sleep.


Thanks for coming.

You can't imagine how
pleased I am to see you.

This is Dr. Matheson, actually.

Oh, I'm sorry.

Please, forgive me.

These last few days have
been a bit difficult.

Don't worry, I should have worn a lab coat.
That's Dr. Buckley.

Nice to meet you.

The pleasure's
all mine, really.

You can't begin to imagine what's
been going on here, really.

We haven't slept
a wink in weeks...

isn't that right, Sarah?

<i>She hasn't been coping very well.
None of us have.</i>

Did I mention we haven't
slept a wink in days?

[loud crash]

That's it.

Did you hear?

It's starting.

[soft thudding]


[odd intonation]
He is a bit angry today.


Traci's been
a real help, you know?

She's, uh... she's
been such a help.


Can we see the rest
of the house?

Sure. This way, please.

It's an old house,
but the price was great.

We only moved in a while ago.
We're still settling in.

Hi, I'm Tom.
Uh, I'm a physicist.

If you want to keep doing...
I'm a physicist, too.

What did you think I was?
A housewife?

A hairdresser?
No, I...

Oh, I... I didn't mean...
Forget it.

Actually, I am a hairdresser.

Oh.

Traci. Traci Northrop.

We're going upstairs.

I know, she's been a real help.

Since when?

I don't know, a few days.

Three or four, isn't
that right, Sarah?

You took so long. We
didn't know where to turn.

We're not a public
service, Mr. Sidgwick.

We do what we can.

Sure. Uh, excuse me a moment.

The girls' room.


How many times have
I told you not to play

on the floor till
the heating gets fixed.

We're still settling
in, you know?

We, uh... still have some
stuff to sort out.

But the price was great.

Stand up, sweetheart,
and say hello.

Say hi.


Hi.
Hi.

You said "the girls."

Julia is at her grandparents'.

She wasn't feeling so great,

so we thought we just as soon

send her back to Vermont
for a few days.

A few days.

[soft sigh]

She's much better now.


Sorry. I didn't
mean to butt in.

Whenever you want.

Too much light.

[Traci sighs deeply]

When I begin the session,
no matter what happens,

please don't break the circle.

It can be dangerous.



Eleven fifteen.

Session participants are, from
the north side: Mr. Sidgwick

and his wife,

Dr. Margaret Matheson
and Traci Northrop.

The session is recorded
by Dr. Thomas Buckley.

[Traci moans]

Temperature is dropping
slowly, one degree...

Correction, two degrees.

Spring scale pressure
remains constant.

I... I can hardly hear you.

Speak up, please.


I can hardly hear you.

I know.

I know, but you
have to speak louder.

[loud claps]

[Mr. Sidgwick]

[table knocking]

Gently.

Please, we've come to help you.

[loud clap]

[all shout]

[Traci breathing heavily]

[table knocking]

[knocking stops]

[Traci breathes rapidly]

It really hurts!

Tell it to stop!


It hurts. I can't...

I demand that you stop!

I'm telling you, I
demand that you stop!

Michael, don't
break the circle.

It hurts! I can't!

Don't break the circle!
I demand that you stop!


[loud thud]

[Traci breathes rapidly]

[door opens]

[Sidgwicks shout]

Mommy! Mommy!

I'm scared, Mommy!

Let's get out of here.
Let's go away from here.

Okay, darling.

Okay.

So do you miss Vermont?

Where do you live?
In Bakersfield.

Nice?

Uh-huh.

Your sister like it too?

Who had the idea
about the closet?

Was that you, or your sister?

Julia.

She show you how to bang it
against the wall like that?

It really scares my dad.

What about your mom?

Mom wants to leave, too.

Let's make a deal,
just between you and me.

Do we have to shake hands?

No, we don't have
to shake hands.

Here's the deal.

If you promise not
to do it again

I won't say
anything to your dad.

That's it.

I... I didn't do that
thing with the table.

No, I know that, Susan. I
didn't ask you about a table.

My sister's gonna be real sad.

Yeah.

She's gonna be real sad.

My car, you drive. That's fair.

Why is that fair?
It is.


You still didn't get
to the bottom of this!

Don't worry about it,
Mr. Sidgwick.

If the banging starts
again, just call us.

And get rid of the hairdresser!

[indistinct voices
over airplane radio]

It's been an honor to fly
you here, Mr. Silver.

I hope you had
a pleasant flight.

Please, allow me to help you...

mind letting go of me?

Thank you.

hard on the top of the table

and draw your hands
toward your body,

the outer two table lengths

are going to go up like
a schoolgirl's dress.

You can even stick
the edge of your shoe

under one of the table legs

and, by pressing down
firmly with your hands

and lifting your foot
at the same time,

you can make the whole
table come off the ground.

It just takes
a little bit of muscle

and a whole lot of practice.

So, with the right
partner in crime,

you can put on quite a show.

The setting is important.
Keep it dark,

always, under
any pretext whatsoever.

The spirits demand it,
you need to concentrate...

I know what you are thinking.
It's not scientific.

But you need darkness to develop
a photograph, don't you?

Miss Owen?

So are you saying that
all paranormal phenomena

are frauds
without any exception?

Actually, no, I'm not.

The majority simply have
a natural explanation

or are the result
of subjective interpretation.

[male student] But how do you
establish proper controls?

It's not difficult.

In a case like this one, without
any special preparation,

we would sit the medium
against the wall

and place two cards
behind his elbows.

Then if he moves his
arms to shift the table,

the cards will fall.

If the cards remain in place,

only the spirit
of a very friendly stagehand

is going to be
moving that table.

That's the principle.

Or if you prefer,
you can mark out

a security perimeter
for the hands

to ensure that
no pressure is applied

outside the center of gravity.

For instance,
for the round table,

it will only move if pressure
is exerted here... or here.

[male student 2] Have you ever
come across a single case

that couldn't be explained?

Like the existence of
an anomalous ability?

An anomalous ability?

Like what?

Like running a hundred
meters in under ten seconds?

Like composing a masterpiece
when you're stone deaf?

Your brain may be
the exception, Ben,

but most brains carry out

a dazzling array of complex
mental processes every second.

100,000 million neurons in
constant synaptic communication

geared to generating and regulating
our sensations and perceptions.

How we reason, how we think,

our emotions,
our mental images,

our attention span,
learning, memory.

Are these not merits enough
for the brain

without it having
"special powers" as well?

[female student] So you're
saying the existence of any kind

of paranormal power
is impossible?

What I'm saying, Miss Owen,

is that after 30 years of
investigating all kinds of phenomena

with the right
controls in place,

I have yet to witness
a single miracle.

Excellent table lifting.
Thank you.

sat in on your class.

Dr. Shackleton.

Inspirational. Congratulations.

You know, I admire
your skepticism, Margaret,

but you can't deny reality just
because you can't explain it.

That's not exactly true.

I can't explain why your
department gets double our budget,

but I don't deny it's the case.

So let's talk, join forces.

We're making huge strides
forward in the SPRC.

A discerning vision like
yours could really help.

I don't do hocus
pocus, Shackleton.

I suggest you don't either.

[audience laughs and claps]

You didn't even touch that.

How do you do that?

Isn't that incredible?

Well, it doesn't
always work, Mike.

I got lucky today,

that's all.

The fact is, we can all do it.

Well, frankly, I knew
that, uh, blind people

had a more developed
sense of smell,

but after what we've
seen here tonight...


You're right. You're right.

<i>[commentator] Simon Silver became
popular at the end of the Sixties</i>

<i>and his fame continued
to grow over the next decade.</i>

<i>In 1975, he suddenly
announced his retirement,</i>

<i>stunning his legion of fans.</i>

<i>Many linked his exit
from the limelight</i>

<i>with the death of a veteran
journalist, Martin Weiner,</i>

<i>a skeptical reporter</i>

<i>who suffered a heart attack</i>

<i>while attending
one of Silver's shows.</i>

<i>The post-mortem concluded
the heart attack was</i>

<i>the result of natural causes,</i>

<i>but Silver was never able
to shake off the suspicion</i>

<i>surrounding Weiner's death.</i>

<i>He disappeared just as suddenly
as he had become a star,</i>

<i>which is why his
come-back announcement</i>

<i>more than 30 years after
his last public appearance...</i>

Margaret, I was watching that.


I thought maybe you wouldn't
hear me, 'cause you... didn't.


Is Dr. Matheson around?

Uh...



Mm.

Can I leave the
assignment with you?

Yeah.

Just watch the coin, okay?

Where'd it go?
Lift your glass, please.

Where did you learn to do that?

You can't always
trust your eyes.

You did most of the magic
by looking in the wrong place.

Oh, now you're really
taking the fun out of it.

The simpler, the better.
That's the principle.

The only way to pull a
rabbit out of a hat

is by putting it there
in the first place.

Open it.

It's in your left hand.

Did you... Did you see that?

No, I got lucky.

The class is really
great, you know?

It makes you think.

So, right, um...

you been working
for Matheson long?

Or are you a psychologist too?

Or a magician?

Wha...? [CHUCKLE]

Uh, no, I'm not a magician.

Um, actually, I'm a physicist.

So why do you do this?
Do what?

Investigate fake
paranormal stuff.

Don't you think
it's a bit weird?

I just try to help Margaret...
I mean, what for?

If someone claims to have
powers and actually don't,

who cares? Why bother?

Why bother?

If your mom was one
of those people

who went to see a psychic

because, um... her stomach
was bothering her

and the psychic

told her that it was nothing,
that it was just a...

a touch of gastritis.

But then later on...

you find out
it was stomach cancer

and it's too late to treat.

Do you think then you'd
say "Why bother?"

Did... did that happen to you?

Okay, watch this.

Ready? [Clears
throat] Here we go.


[groans continue]

Oh, God! Jesus Christ!



how did you do that?
Doesn't that hurt?

No.

Well, a litt... a little.

Margaret Matheson.

Hello?




Are you okay, Stevie?

You want your music, Stevie?

You want us
to put on your music?

Sometimes it helps him
to listen to music.

Okay.


[loud music from stereo]

this is really cool!

We do too, but we don't paint!

Only Stevie paints!

Isn't that right, Stevie?

You paint, don't you?

Kids, huh?

Automatic painting, my ass!

I was about to make him
eat those crayons.

You heard it, it was, it
was the interference.

It was because Stevie and Van Gogh,
they just... they don't talk.

If it would help him channel,

I'm sure the mother would be
happy to cut off his ear.


Well, a 90 mile drive.
Hm.

And not one lousy doodle.

Are you okay?

If it were just
me on my own, I...

I don't think I could continue.

I'm getting too old
for this shit.

Oh, come on.

Where did you spring from?

You know you could
have a brilliant career

at any university
in the world, right?

You know that.

Mm. I like this.
But why are you with me?

Hey, so, um...

Yeah, I was, uh...

You know, maybe
it would be good if

someone else joined the team.
Do you ever think about that?

She's a little young,
don't you think?

Who?

For what?

Right.

I think I'll look in on David.

If you could drop
me there, please.

Okay.

The reason people
believe in ghosts is

the same as the
reason they believe

in haunted houses
or tunnels of light.

Because it would mean that there
was something... after death.

I only wish there were.

But I'm not prepared
to let my... beliefs

be determined by my
desires or my... needs.

If David woke up now
and looked in the mirror,

he wouldn't even
know who the man was

staring back at him.

He wouldn't know who I was.

If I thought for one second

that there was something else,

I would shut off all this crap

and let my son go.

Margaret.

<i>[sighs]</i>

A contactee was visited
and raped on a daily basis

by an extraterrestrial.

Savagely possessed.
Every night.

So she goes to a hypnologist
and the visits stop.

So she goes back to the
hypnologist and <i>says:</i>

"Can't you just make him
come back once a week?"

<i>[sighs]</i>

You know, there are two
kinds of people out there

with a special gift:

The ones who really think
they have some kind of power

and the other guys...

who think
we can't figure them out.

They're both wrong.

[band music]

[music continues]

[shutter clicking]

you a little young?

[Shutter clicks]


Right.

So what are we looking for?

Red lights.

Red lights?

Discordant notes,

things that shouldn't be there.

Like that guy over there.

[shutter clicks]


Hey, what about over there?

Well spotted.

[shutter clicking]

I'm so so sorry.
What, are you blind?

It's totally my fault.
Watch where you're going.

No, I wasn't watching. I'm sorry.
Give me that.

I'm sorry.
Go on, just get lost now, will you, buddy?

Apologies.

[band music continues]

<i>[sighs]</i>

Hoo.

Ha.


Good. In we go.

Okay.

[music continues distant]


told I like the box all to myself.

Yes, of course, doctor,
we know that,

but I was just thinking
we'd have a safe...

And I'm sure you understand
that this deployment

is not what I meant
when I said discreet.

Dr. Matheson.

I'll give the orders
to pull back.

[Distant crowd claps]

[music and clapping]

[indistinct police radio]

[bell rings in theater]

so sure this guy's a fraud?

of Occam's razor?

Occam's razor?

When I hear the
drumming of hooves,

I don't think unicorns,

I think horses.


Hm.

[music stops]

[Italian accent] My name
is Leonardo Palladino.

I can see things.

Just like you.

If not, I would be blind.

I am a mentalist.

I've got a mind, like you.

I'm a clairvoyant.

I can see clearly.

[machine hums]

He hasn't changed
a single word.

The only difference...

You know Palladino from before?
Hm.


We've had, Leonardo Borga,

Giordano and... What was it?


Zarica. But Leonardo Palladino,
it's our first time.

And we're just thrilled.


Not with this light.
The <i>glass</i> is polarized.

No one can see anything.

Unless of course they
have special powers.

what I don't believe in.

Watch this.

I don't believe in angels
of light curing the good.

I don't believe in
extraterrestrial beings

coming down from the sky

to guide the human race
to an age of re-awakening.

That's new.

[electronic noise]

Is that the Zimmer?

Yeah, I fixed it.
It's all good.

You fixed it? You should
have sent it out.

We don't have any
money. It's fine.

Tom, we should
ask for the money.

I said I fixed it. It'll work.


I don't believe in the Devil.

I don't believe in gods.

I don't believe in God himself!

[voice echoes]

I only believe

in a primal, single...

Come on, Tom, let's go.

I'm on it.

...an explosion of lucidity,

old like the world, which
burns deep within me

and explodes with savage
brutality...

Tom.
Yeah, just give me a sec.

Tom.
One second. I'm on it.

I only believe in me!

Tom!

I only believe in me!




That's it. Got it.

No. We got lucky.

Hey. You guys lose this?

A lot of cancer. Mm.

I'm here, I'm back. There's
no doubt about that.

[audience applauds]

You know what I'm
talking about, Simon.

Are you going back on stage?

Well, who knows, Nina.

I heard it's
a distinct possibility.

I know it's a delicate subject,

but your last show didn't
turn out so great.

According to some
people, you were...

That was a long time ago

and I said all I had to
say about it back then.

It was a just an unfortunate
thing that happened.

You gotta admit it was weird.

Your biggest
detractor attacks you

at your own show, and...

It was unpleasant for everyone.

The rumor at the time was that

Martin Weiner
was writing a book

to demonstrate that you
were, uh... well, a fake.

That's, that's
the kind of thing

that I mean
that doesn't stack up.

The same folks out there
who say I have no powers

also say I induced a
heart attack in Martin.

Your number one enemy?

You're safe with me, Nina.

[all laugh]

You know what I think?

I think you're getting
everybody to talk about you

without even going
out there again.

Wouldn't that just
confirm my powers?

[all laugh]

You bet it would!

You know, Silver? I've been
wanting to do this for 30 years.

You know what I've
brought with me?

Let me guess.

[audience claps]

Is it something that I can...

bend?

Well, how did you know that?

Did you just read my mind?

No. The handle's been
sticking out of your pocket

for the last few minutes.

So you can...

[audience laughs and claps]

You are just a big
kid, you know that?

<i>All right, what
do you guys think?</i>

<i>Should we ask him to bend it?</i>


me watch TV in this place?

Because only housewives
watch that show. [Thud]

Come on!

I have nothing
against housewives.

My mom happens to be one.

<i>I'm sure your mom</i>

doesn't sit around all day doing
macramÃ© and watching crap TV.

We should take
a shot at Silver.

Oh, come on. Forget about it.

There's nothing interesting
for us there.

This arrived this morning.

It hasn't been
digitally retouched.

[elevator dings]


Are there no real
challenges left out there?

Silver's a real challenge.

Silver's already
been investigated.

Yeah, like 30 years ago. We
should investigate him now.

He doesn't interest me.
Forget him.

He interests me. Come on! He's
gonna be here in 10 days.

You are like a broken record.
I said no.

What is wrong with you?
Are you afraid of him?

[elevator dings]

into a chart for me... Margaret!

Margaret, I heard about Palladino.
Everyone's talking about it.

I wanted to say thank you. People
like them give us a bad name.

I doubt it.

Come on, Margaret,
give us a break.

It's serious work
we're doing up there.

We started with scores of 2.1.

You know, nothing to write
home about, I know,

but in the last couple of
weeks we scored 3.4, 4, 4.6...

And the chances the difference are down
to coincidence is <i>2</i> in 100, Margaret.

Paul.
Two in a hundred!

[cell phone rings]

All right...

All right.

Tom, go ahead and start
class without me.

Take this, this and that.

And, um, show them the photograph.
They'll enjoy that.

I won't be long.

So what is it this time?
Psychic photography?

Retrocognition, remote vision?
Telepathy.

Drawings, sealed envelopes, cards?
Zener cards.

Double blind, triple
blind, simple blind?

Simple blind. I did it myself.

I take it from your enthusiasm
you just did a test.

That's right.

Were you facing your subject?

Sure.

What about them?

Uh, they were in the control
booth, monitoring the subject.

Who was monitoring you?

Me? Why would anyone want
to be monitoring me?

It's a joke.

So were you at the same
eye level as the subject?

Approximately, yes.

Under a light, I guess.
Yes.

The way we are now?

More or less, I guess.

You have the cards with you?
No, I-I don't have them here.

[MAN, INDISTINCT]

Oh. Yeah, here.
Okay.

Okay.

Shoot.

What do you mean, "shoot"?

Go ahead. Shoot.

T-To you?
Sure.


Here?
Why not?


Square.

<i>Cross.</i>

Square.

How are you doing that?

Methodological defects...
No, w... w... they're not transparent, we make sure...

improper controls, the inadvertent
inclusion of relevant data

or, in this case,

all three at the same time.

Congratulations.

Next time, try taking
them off first.

So why'd you hold the
card up to the light?

So you wouldn't think
about your glasses.

made during the Cold War...

under conditions controlled
by the Soviet authorities,

so there was no
independent investigations.

Leningrad, 1970.

Here Katia Novikova carries out

one of her more
controversial experiments.

As you can see,

she concentrates intensely
on the heart of the frog,

at the beginning
making it beat faster,

then slower,

and then, stopping
it beating altogether.

Katia asserted that she had, she had
inherited her powers from her mother...

and that during her childhood,
she would see objects...

all the time, Dr. Matheson.

And yes, there are sensitives
who are impostors,

just like there are skeptics.

Uh, you know, even scientists
are wrong every day.

But you, the
professional skeptics,

you also seem to be
experts in rhetoric.

Don't... don't bite off
my finger, doctor.

Look where I'm pointing.

Scientists' mistakes are
usually random, Mr. Cohen.

Pseudo-scientists' mistakes
tend to be directional.

Dr. Matheson seems
to forget that she

set up her stall
on this over 30 years ago.

Most professionals are fully
aware of the dangers of fraud

and design their experiments with
every imaginable precaution.

We're believers, doctor,
not simply credulous.

Very smart people are
often the most credulous

and are taken in by all
kinds of phenomena.

They're easy victims of fraud
because they think logically,

and professional magicians
count on that.

Like your client, for instance.
He's certainly one of them.

You should've told me
she would be here.

Oh, you said you wouldn't
speak to my client.

Are you scared of me too?

The question is why does every
parapsychological phenomenon vanish

when there's a qualified
skeptic in the room?

Three to four Americans say they've had
some kind of metaphysic experience

and an even
higher percentage say...

He's gotta be in on it.
He's in on it.

Doctor, this is a question for you.
Don't you think...?

Margaret, just
get out of there.

And even my colleagues,

the experimental psychologistsâ€œ.

They're just gonna box her in.
They're just boxing her in.

...about their approach
to strange occurrences.

This is just what I'm
saying, it's just rhetoric.

It's just pure rhetoric,

it's just talking the talk,
but to refute the role

that all crows are black you need
just one single white one. Actually...

I've never seen a
white crow, have you?

Look a bit harder.

Miss Hansen, I believe that
you're Simon Silver's agent,

are you not?

I guess that means you've
gotten to know him pretty well

over the years, is that true?

I'm privileged.
He's a constant inspiration.

Silver's comeback has turned
into an event.

His recent sell-out performances
in both Atlanta and Dallas

can only be described
as an unbelievable success.

Today he will be
performing in our city,

at the Columbus Theater, less than
500 yards away from this studio.

Now, Miss Hansen, is "perform"...?
That's a funny word.

Do you think that's the right word
to describe what's going on here?

I would say "share."

Simon has never been ashamed of
sharing his extraordinary abilities.

I think that "perform"
is exactly the right word.

I beg to disagree.

Why allow for a rigorous study

when the mass spectacle
is there to be embraced

and there's money to be made?

A lot of money,
I would imagine.

The word "choice."

Excuse me, Simon Silver.
Taking advantage of people.

Was subjected to rigorous studies
by at least two different...

Oh, come on!

Universities of
unquestionable renown.

But I guess
you know this, doctor,

since you were on one
of those committees.

<i>I never signed off
on the findings however.</i>

Are you okay?
Sh... sh... sh.

<i>[Margaret] The
experiments weren't done</i>

<i>under proper
controlled conditions</i>

controlled conditions.

Those of us born different
feel real safe.

Complete inspection
of all body orifices,

Faraday cages where we are
locked away like animals,

And... and you're
surprised that Silver

refused to subject
himself to that.

No, I'm not at all surprised

that he refused to
follow the one protocol

that would effectively eliminate
any possibility of fraud.

All this sounds very convincing,
doctor, but in actual fact,

telepathic experiments...

No, no, no, no, do not
go on the defensive.

Margaret, do not go
on the defensive!

She's going on the defensive.

Can you see this?
This is what she does.

She goes on the defensive and
then the whole thing just...


my considerable experience
investigating these phenomena,

Aw, don't give 'em an edge.

<i>Of the existence
of paranormal powers...</i>

She's gonna mention the bone.

Just wait, she's gonna
mention the bone.

Do not mention the bone.

I've spoken to some
of those supposed victims

whose eyes you
claim to have opened,

and, believe me, they don't
have very nice things

to say about you.

Telling people they've been
victimized by these crazy ideas

and then trying to get
the ideas away from them

it's like trying to take
a bone away from a dog.

[MANY GROANS]

They don't want to let go.

<i>[man] Maybe I don't
know my place but...</i>

How did you know that?

Because I'm psychic.


that's exactly what we are to you.
We were animals.

What I'm saying is give me
proof that a photon of light

can pass through a human body

and I will start to
believe in invisibility.

Until that happens,

all we're talking about here
is simple subjective beliefs.

believe in, Dr. Matheson?

Do you have a transcendent
view of life?


Well, you talk about beliefs.

What do you believe in?

Well, I don't really see what
that has to do with anything.

Well, it's a very
simple question

that maybe you can answer.

I'm just asking you,
do you believe or don't you?

understand, not believe.

So you accept that it's possible
there's something out there?

No, I didn't say that.

You're <i>a</i> religious person?

No. You know, once, long
ago, I suppose I was.

Long ago?

And you lost your faith.
What... what happened, what...

What happened to
turn you into this...

lost, lonely woman?

It's just a simple question.
We're done.

<i>[Cohen] Oh, so just
get up and walk away?</i>

<i>I didn't mean anything by it.</i>

<i>Sometimes things get
said, Dr. Matheson,</i>

<i>and it's not always
pure hyperbole...</i>

<i>It's always
the same with girls.</i>

<i>[host] I'm terribly
sorry about this.</i>

<i>We expected her to
follow through...</i>

<i>[Cohen] Animals!</i>

<i>[host] ...and I hope
she'll come back.</i>

<i>Meantime, thank
you to the panelists.</i>

of the kinder ones.

What the hell were you thinking?
Tom.

Do you have any idea the
advantage he has over us now?

In one minute we've
gone back decades!

We gotta investigate Silver!
We gotta do it now!

Tom, I can see you're angry...

You've been keeping me
away from him for weeks.

I'm not stupid, Margaret,
so stop pretending I am.

I know you're not.
He is not worth your...

Enough!

We gotta investigate him,

and if you won't,
I'll do it on my own.

Look, I know they did
a job on you, okay?

I know it wasn't fair and
that stooge of Silver's

played dirty. But she did it.

They took you by
surprise, I understand.

I don't know what I would
have done in your place

but here's where we are:
We look like idiots.

It's been over two years

since we received
a lousy private dollar

and the department funding
is so ridiculously low,

the only way they can make it
clearer they want rid of us

is with a marching band.

It has nothing to do
with the university,

it's Silver.

But Silver wasn't even there!

Silver is always there.

Don't you get it?

No, we gotta
investigate Silver!

And we gotta do it now!

Tom, sit down.

Just sit down.

[deep sigh]

Please?

<i>[sighs]</i>

This is how he does it.

He did it to me, and now
he's doing it to you.

What does that even mean?
It's not the first time.

He knows what he's doing.

We're weak, Tom. We want to
be strong but we're not.

You're not angry with me.

Every time I close my eyes,
I see my son that day.

I see David playing
over there on the floor.

He was so small. He was sturdy.

And then he fell.

He just fell over.

I thought he was
playing, but he wasn't.

He was four years old.

Margaret, I'm really...
Shh.

Everything's all right.

I write to him, you know?

Because I know
he can't hear me.

"Dear David..."

Silver and I

were on a television show just
like the one yesterday...

and he was shouting.

I was shouting.

We were young.

And then he started staring.

Not at me.

He was staring at
something beside me,

as if he could see
someone beside me,

you know, the
way the mediums do

when they say they
can see an angel or...

or a dead relative next to you.

No. I wasn't surprised.

I was expecting theatrics,

so I was prepared.

"I see a boy by your side.

"I see a blond boy.

"Do you know who that
might be, Margaret?"

"Has a boy close to you died?"

I didn't answer.

I couldn't speak.

I was so frightened.

And he kept going.

"This boy is asking
you to let him go.

"He says you
have to let him go."

"It's his time and you
won't let him go."

Now, did I denounce him

<i>as</i> an unscrupulous fraud?

Did I tell him that my
son was still alive?

Did I say anything in front
of those millions of people

who were waiting for my answer?

No. I didn't say a thing.

And you know the one
thing I can't forgive?

And I hate myself
for feeling this.

I hate myself from the moment
I wake up in the morning

to when I close
my eyes at night.

What I can't forgive is not
that he dared to use my son,

my sleeping, sick son.

What I can't forgive
is that for one second,

and it only lasted a second,

I thought it might be true.

He made me doubt!

And everyone could see it.

He's dangerous, Tom.

Stay away from him.

you really know?

What can you really trust?

What are your doubts?
What are your certainties?

What do you call truth?

When you look at the sky,
what do you see?

Shadows? Reflections?

Distant echoes?

You see the moon as it was
more than a second ago.

You see the sun as it was
shining eight minutes ago.

But what do you really see?

Can you trust your eyes?

Can you trust... me?

We can go forward
with lies but...

we can never go back.


[squishy sounds]

<i>[sighs]</i>



You are cured.


Go in peace.

I never felt proud
of being what I am.

I didn't choose it.
I didn't ask for anything.

Why was I chosen?
Who singled me out?

Right now.
At this very instant.

I can hear you.

I don't... uh, I don't know.

They haven't told me anything.

You're hurt.

[Tom whispers]
I wasn't with her.

I wasn't with her.

I was at the theater

She told me not to go.

I said horrible things.

[Metal door closes]

Yes, Buckley, Leonardo.
Good memory.

You're butting in already!

At 5:00 a.m. they give you
a little carton of milk.

I don't eat breakfast.
I wait until lunch at eleven.

Elbow macaroni with hot
pepper, rice, frijoles...

Hardly ever meat.

Sometimes you get
a spicy hamburger.

They think we're all Mexicans.

At five, you get
the same thing again.

And that's it
until the next day.

So at night I take out
my carton of milk.

Leonardo..

I've lost 15 pounds
in less than 4 weeks.

Leonardo!
Yes?

You told Silver we'd be there,

didn't you?

You told him how
we shut you down.

Did the blind guy
spook us then, Buckley?


Did the blind guy see us
when we were up to no good?

When'd you talk to Silver?

Buckley, you've come
to the wrong place.

Silver doesn't need me to know

whatever he wants
to know, get it?

This isn't one of your shows.

I'm the guy
who put you in here.

Now tell me when
you spoke to Silver!

I hardly know Silver, you
fucking shit for brains!

You worked with him
for over a year!

20 years ago! Did
nobody tell you that?

I'm 37, Buckley.

I was just a fucking
kid back then.

He used me!

I just had to cry and shut
up whenever he told me.

Do you think he spilled his
fucking heart out to me?

I'm wasting my time here.

You've got no idea what
you're getting yourself into.

Good seeing you
again, Leonardo.

You've got no idea what
you're getting yourself into!

<i>[man on radio]
Whoa, did you know...</i>

<i>Silver canceled his
last performances in Denver</i>

<i>[woman on radio] I guess

<i>I mean, last show in

Ow.

<i>Anybody blind out there

Why didn't you tell me?
Why don't you step into my office?

I want to be on that

Whatever it takes,

I don't care what,
I wanna be there.

It's impossible. The team
has already been presented.

There's nothing I can do.

Don't give me your excuses,
Shackleton. Just do it.

The committee was

You know what that means?

It's a once

Margaret was right. Can't you see it?
Just let it go.

<i>[Shackleton] This film
shows the first six days</i>

<i>of investigation carried out</i>

<i>in the Scientific Paranormal
Research Center</i>

<i>with Mr. Simon Silver.</i>

<i>All the images correspond to the
filming of real experiments.</i>

<i>No scene has been recreated.</i>

<i>This is Simon Silver.</i>

<i>For the following experiment,</i>

<i>Silver received three different
models of still camera:</i>

<i>A middle range digital camera</i>

<i>with a fixed /ens
focused on infinity,</i>

<i>a conventional
analogical camera</i>

<i>with a 50 mm /ens
focused on infinity</i>

<i>and an instant Polaroid camera,
also focused on infinity.</i>

<i>Silver's attempts
with the digital camera</i>

<i>did not produce
any positive result.</i>

<i>The second camera registered
only partial results,</i>

<i>insufficient for
a positive evaluation.</i>

<i>Only the Polaroid camera allowed
the apparent projection</i>

<i>of Silver's thoughts
onto the photographic plate.</i>

<i>There is no scientific
explanation for these results.</i>

<i>The cylinder or gizmo which
Silver was provided with</i>

<i>in order to concentrate
the flow of his thoughts</i>

<i>was carefully checked before
and after each experiment</i>

<i>in order to rule out
any possible manipulation.</i>

<i>Silver claims to be capable of
bending metal at a distance</i>

<i>without needing to touch it.</i>

<i>However, during the
course of these tests,</i>

<i>this could not be
experimentally confirmed.</i>

<i>Following a more
re/axed protocol,</i>

<i>Silver was allowed
to touch the metal</i>

<i>which, as can be seen
in the film, was indeed bent.</i>

<i>Visual analysis of the film
is insufficient to determine</i>

<i>whether Silver possesses
extremely strong fingers</i>

<i>and great control of
micro-manipulation movements</i>

<i>or whether the distortion
is in fact caused</i>

<i>by a paranormal ability,
as he claims.</i>

<i>Later, Simon Silver
held his hand out</i>

<i>in the continuous flow
of a running tap.</i>

<i>As the images show, the flow
of water was notably deviated</i>

<i>by some kind of external
stimulus around Silver's hand.</i>

<i>The difficulty in measuring
this distortion</i>

<i>in a conclusive manner,</i>

<i>means this demonstration</i>

<i>has been excluded from
any experimental evaluation.</i>


got it, Doctor.

I was trying with
the second adapter

but if I could just join...


Concentrate, Ben.

I appreciate your help.
No more mistakes, okay?

I'm sorry, Doctor, I promise...

Don't promise anything.
Just plug it in. Good.


Okay.

Keep going, keep going, keep going...

Stop! Stop there.

Telepathy booths.

During the whole two weeks,

I wasn't able to get
within six feet of Silver,

but you and I both know
the whole thing is a farce.

Actually, Dr. Buckley, I...
A total fucking farce. Okay, rewind.

Keep going, keep going.

Okay, go over to the
other side of the gym.

Stop, Ben! Stop there! Stop!

You know, right now, Shackleton
is analyzing the data,

getting ready to publish
his positive findings tonight,

which just happens to coincide
with Silver's last show,

which by some
strange coincidence,

just happens to be taking place

in this very city.

It's the finale he's
been after all along.

Well, why all this pressure?

If we find out
something afterwards,

they'll have to change
the findings.

Ben, nothing that happens
afterwards will matter.

Listen to me.
You are the only guy

separating the world from stupidity
at this point in time. Okay?

Okay? Now, you see this button?

I've spent two days loading all
the images from all the cameras

then synching them
frame by frame,

with all the
angles in here, okay?


[TV turns on]


This is the reception booth.
Silver is the receiver.

That's the instrument panel.
It's got ten luminous buttons.

Normally they put
a playing card in each one,

but given that Silver is blind

they've just numbered
them one through ten.

Okay, and what's
supposed to...?

Quiet. Now, second booth.


It doesn't matter.
It's just a dead bird.

transmission booth.

Now, you see the monitor?
It's a closed circuit.

his own panel?

No. No, no, no.
He's seeing Silver's panel.

It's supposed
to help him concentrate.

So the computer randomly
turns on alight.

Then the guy concentrates

on the number he's
been given. Okay?

When he thinks
he knows the number,

he presses the red button,

which sets off a signal
in Silver's booth.

When Silver hears the signal,

he clears his mind, he
concentrates, whatever the fuck,

when he thinks
he knows the answer,

he presses
the corresponding number

he think the guy has sent.

Is that clear?

Okay. The experiment lasted

a total of seven
hours, including breaks.

It was repeated a total of
nine times, in blocks of ten.

The results were spectacular,
with a deviation rate

eight times higher than
can be explained by chance.

Now, what does this mean?

That Silver's powers...?

No! It means that Silver
is pulling a fast one!

Do you know how I know this?
Because telepathy does not exist!

Because nobody
has special powers!

No. The protocol,
in theory, is sound.

It's just that Silver has
found a way of breaching it.

Okay, don't look
for radio transmitters,

because the booths work as Faraday chambers.
I've checked them.

They're isolated.

What if he's not
pulling a fast one?

Ben, you've got 41/2 hours

of footage there
from seven cameras.

That's 30 hours.
What am I looking for?

An explanation, Ben,
just an explanation.

Try to make it rational.



Is everything okay, sweetie?



[door opens]

[door closes]



[old man groans]

[man screams]

[animal-like growl]


I'll be with you
in just a minute.

I'm not a very
accessible person.

I suppose you've
realized that by now.

Only somebody who really wants
to get to me can do so.

I won't talk to
anybody else today.

Maybe I'll do so tomorrow,
in some other city.

Maybe I won't ever again.

As for me, I live each day
as if it were my last.

And I'm starting to feel tired.

Very tired indeed.

I don't always demand payment for
my services, did you know that?

At least, not in money. There's
other ways of paying for things.

But you know that already.

You do know that, don't you?

To be or to appear to be,

that is the question.
It always is.

We all try to be
something we're not.

[distant thunder]

We dream 27 times a night.

An intricate neurological
protection mechanism

which makes us forget.

What protects you?

Aline of salt?

From the time of ancient
Greece to the present day,

philosophers and scholars
have argued

man is essentially rational.

I don't happen to agree.

If one observes and
studies another person

without having first
studied oneself,

how do we know whether our
instruments are appropriately set?

How do we know we are reliable?
We have no proof.

There's only one way

of gaining access to the truth,

and that's not
to expect anything.

[distant thunder]

If our intentions aren't pure,

we might end up
creating monsters.

[distant thunder]

Hm. Please excuse me.
It's getting late.

For you too.

Don't worry, we'll see
each other again.

Oh, yes. We'll see
each other again.

<i>[Tom sighs]</i>

<i>[Reporter] Silver is in the
final stages of his countdown,</i>

<i>only 12 hours after the announcement
of his most recent retirement.</i>

This unexpected news
has caused commotion...

...all kinds of
contradictory reactions.

Those that predicted that
Silver had come back to stay

have had no option
but to accept...

[thunder crashes]

...estimate that Silver
may well have pocketed

more than four million dollars
in less than a month,

a figure that would confirm...

most immediate consequences,

with prices of up
to 2,000 dollars

being asked by
scalpers for seats,

a more than dubious record
being held today...

...packed out an hour and
a half before the start

of what will be
his last appearance.

It is impossible to predict
an outcome for this...

...and it's with
great expectation

the verdict from the Scientific
Paranormal Research Center,

to be announced
officially tonight.

If the leaks get out...

...maybe thereby silencing
more than one skeptical voice,

and transcending
once and for all

the area of mystification

and the study
of frontier sciences.

Science has rarely had the
chance to study at close hand

such controversial
manifestations

as those which have made
Simon Silver famous.

<i>We really have to wonder if the
spectators presently witnessing</i>

<i>the final chance to see Simon
Silver will get what' they paid...</i>


Why have you come here tonight?

What are you hoping to see?

Do you think I
should surprise you?

Do you think I
should entertain you?

What are you
looking at so closely?

What do you know about me?
How much do you believe?

How much do
you want to believe?

I can feel your longings,
your desires...

I can feel your demands.

It is a deep, painful
urgency of the animal

forced to live in darkness

which finally opens his eyes
and voraciously demands light

with a howl of rage!

What is it you've come to see?

This?

Have you come to see this?

[audience gasps]

I feel my veins burning

with the fire
of a new understanding!

[voice echoes]

[electric short]


We called Ptolemy insane,

we spat in the face of Galileo,

we burned Giordano Bruno...

What did we need?

What do we need
in order to learn?

[audience clapping]

What makes us be what we are?

What finally makes
us come to accept?

What makes us believe?

The question is:
Why did you come here...

today?

Are you crazy? I shouldn't
even be talking to you.

Wait, wait, Ben,
I'm not against you.

I... I just need to
know what you've got.

You're my student
too, remember?

Dr. Shackleton,
you know I can't talk.

Listen, Ben,
I've always respected.

Dr. Buckley's work,
and Dr. Matheson's.

I'm not the enemy.

I'm sorry, Doctor.
I'm going to hang up.

Ben, I've got the results
of nine days of experiments

sitting right
here in front of me.

Definitive results.

The only thing missing
is my signature.

I'm talking about the scientific
verification of extrasensory perception

and forces which until today have
only been seen as para-science...

I can imagine.

Do you have any idea what the
publication of these results

will mean to Dr. Buckley
and his department?

Yeah, I... I guess.

Ben, if we've got
anything wrong, anything,

I need to know.

What have you got?

Nothing.

What?

What do you mean?
We got...

nothing.

[crashing thunder]


[Man 1] Final call,
we'd better get going.

[Man 2] I hope the second half
is better than the first.

I didn't spend 300
bucks to see Hamlet.

[door closes]


[man whistling]

[whistling continues]


[whistling becomes distant]


Sally!
Ben? What are you doing here?

how pleased I am to see you.

Tom told me you'd be here.

You should be
doing this, not me.

What are you doing here?
Where is Tom? He's not home

and he's not answering his phone.
Did something happen to him?

Is that SPCR?

Telepathy booths. I've been
watching the same images.

If you want my opinion...
Ben, I don't. Where is Tom?

With Silver, I think.

What do you mean with Silver?
At the theater.

It's nothing out
of the ordinary.

He wants you to wait for him
here, so take a seat.

He's perfectly all right.


[choked shout]


[grunts and groans]

<i>[shouts]</i>


<i>[shouts]</i>



[heavy breathing]

What's that?

What's what?
That. There.


Silver wear a watch?

Blind people wear watches too.

They tell the time
by touching the hands.

They checked it. It's clean.

Can you split the image in two?

[grunts and groans]


[shouting underwater]





What are you looking for?
I don't know yet.

Put the sender on the left
and Silver on the right.



Can you do that?
On the watches? Sure. Give me a sec.


Let me try with another camera.

improve the quality?

Mm-hm. Sure. I can
amplify a single pixel,

click it up with my magic

and make it so bright and shiny

you need sunglasses
to look at it.

This ain't a movie.

We're in
the psychology department.

All right.
Go to the other camera.

I'd like to know
what the hell is...

There! Stop!

Shit, Sally. It's a
recording, you know?

We can go back and forth
as much as we want.

We can chill out.

Are you sure they're synchronized?
Yes.

Completely?
Completely.

What are you looking for? They
don't have the same time.

What are the chances
that Silver and the sender

are both wearing
analogical watches

and that both are
synchronized second by second

in millimetric precision?

Synchronized? Didn't you
hear what I just said?

The watches don't tell
the same time.

Second by second.



They divide.

They just have to divide the dial
of the watch into ten sections,

one for each number.

When the second hand reaches
the corresponding section...

...the sender presses
the button.

Silver just has to know
where the second hand is

when he hears the signal

and translate it
to the position.


Dr. Buckley was right.
It's a fraud.

Silver never touched the hands.

The simpler, the better.

Okay, it's right here
in front of us.

What was it Matheson
used to say?

Results appear when there
is defective methodology,

important data is
inadvertently included...

...or improper controls
are in place.

They've taken
something for granted.

Oh, Shit.

Silver can see.

[Reporters shouting]


[Tom's voice echoes]

[thunder rumbles]

Simon Silver.

Did you really
need to go this far?

know the truth,

but the truth will
make you furious.

Ladies and gentlemen, and
I don't think I'm wrong

when I say

we have a distinguished
guest amongst us.


It's okay.

The young and persistent
Thomas Buckley,

<i>as</i> many of you may know,

decided some time ago
to devote part of his life

to making mine
as difficult as possible.

Am I going too far

if I say he seems
somewhat out of sorts?


In the end I just wasn't able.

But you know that, don't you?

You can't deny yourself.

You can't live
in denial forever!

I tried with all my strength.


Today it will be over.

For you and for me.

I just hope we're both ready.
You're a fool, Buckley.

Are you threatening me
in front of everyone?

I'm not like you. You can't hurt me.
I am the life force!

I come with the wind
and I go with the wind.

Do you want me to hurt you?

Get out of here
now while you can.

interrupt anything

but I'd really
like to sit down.

My arm is hurting.

Then put it down. There's
nothing stopping you.

I just... just I...
I simply can't.

Don't believe everything
they tell you.

off sitting down.


Are you challenging me? Are
you questioning my power?

heads with noise.

Stay where you are. Do
you want me to hurt you?

We renounce ever
knowing ourselves.

But you can't deny
yourself forever.

Isn't that right?

Buckley!

Don't you dare ignore me!

Time goes on.

And you think you have
all the time in the world,

that nothing is final...

But time goes on.

Stay where you are.
Don't take another step.

You're playing with fire,
I'm telling you.

You're playing with fire!

But in the end, so much
time has gone by...

And you know you should
have done something,

and then you wake up.

Don't you know the kind of
force you're up against?

It's already over.

Stay where you are!
Margaret never knew.

I don't think you don't know
what you're up against.

I never told her.
She never knew.

Don't come any closer.

And now everything is a lie!

Don't come any closer!
I'm warning you!

Did you know all along, Simon Silver?
Did you know?


That's all I want to know.
Did you know all along?

Buckley!


Buckley!

Buckley!






[animal-like growl]

How did you do that?


Phoney.

How did you do that?

Simon, come with me.

How did you do that?

How did you do that?

<i>[Tom] Dear Margaret,</i>

<i>Even today I'm not exactly
sure when everything ended.</i>

<i>I wanted to cry,
to feel anger, grief}</i>

<i>to feel,</i>

<i>just like I used to.</i>

<i>A whole life denying myself I</i>

<i>searching in silence
for someone like me.</i>

<i>A whole life
looking for an answer,</i>

<i>without finding it.</i>

<i>I /earned so many things
from you.</i>

<i>But I forgot
the most essential thing.</i>

How did you know that?

Because I'm psychic.

Silver?


It was me all along,

wasn't it, Margaret?

you spring from?

Why are you with me?


all along.

You can't deny
yourself forever.

You did most of the magic
by looking in the wrong place.

I did what you'd have wanted.

But I'll never forgive myself
for not revealing myself,

for not at least giving
you the consolation

of knowing...

there is something else.

[flat beep]

But you deserve more.

Today you deserve everything.

You can't deny yourself.

You can't deny
yourself forever.
