Ok, on your toes, men.

Hi-ho, Silver!

Hey, we got to save Olive Oyl!

Hail, Rome!

Victorious...
in thy mourning weeds!

Lo, as the bark that hath
discharged her freight

returns with precious lading
to the bay

from whence at first
she weighed her anchorage,

cometh Andronicus,
bound with laurel boughs,

to re-salute his country
with his tears.

Stand gracious to the rites
that we intend!

Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons

behold the poor remains,
alive and dead.

These that survive,
let Rome reward with love.

These that I bring
unto their latest home

with burial amongst their ancestors.

Here Goths have given me leave
to sheathe my sword.

Titus, unkind and careless
of thine own,

why suffer'st thou thy sons,
unburied yet,

to hover on
the dreadful shore of Styx?

Make way to lay them
by their brethren!

O sacred receptacle of my joys,

sweet cell of virtue and nobility,

how many sons of mine
hast thou in store

that thou wilt never
render to me more?

And there greet in silence,
as the dead are wont,

and sleep in peace,
slain in your country's wars.

Give us the proudest prisoner
of the Goths

that we may hew his limbs,
and on a pile...

Admanes fratrum.

sacrifice his flesh.

That so the shadows
be not unappeased,

nor we disturbed
with prodigies on earth.

I give him you,
the noblest that survives:

the eldest son of
this distressed queen.

No! Stay, Roman brethren!

Gracious conqueror,

victorious Titus,
rue the tears I shed--

the mother's tears
in passion for her son.

No!

If thy sons were ever dear to thee,

oh, think my son to be
as dear to me.

Sufficeth not that
we are brought to Rome

to beautify your triumphs and return,

captive to thee and thy Roman yoke?

But must my sons be slaughtered
in the streets

for valiant doings
in their country's cause?

Oh, if to fight for king and commonweal
were piety in thine,

it is in these.

Andronicus...

stain not thy tomb with blood.

Wilt thou draw near
the nature of the gods?

Draw near them then
in being merciful.

Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge.

Thrice noble Titus...

spare my born-born son.

Patient yourself,
madam, and pardon me.

These are their brethren,
whom your Goths beheld

alive and dead,

and for their brethren slain,

religiously they ask a sacrifice.

To this your son is marked...

and die he must
to appease their groaning shadows

that are gone.

Away with him
and make a fire straight.

And with our swords,
upon a pile of wood

let's hew his limbs
till they be clean consumed.

O cruel, irreligious piety!

Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?

Oppose not Scythia
to ambitious Rome.

Alarbus goes to rest,

and we survive to tremble
under Titus' threatening looks.

Stand resolved...

but hope withal
the gods may favor Tamora,

the queen of Goths,

to quit these bloody wrongs
upon her foes.

See, lord and Father,

how we have performed
our Roman rites!

Alarbus' limbs are lopped,

and entrails feed
the sacrificing fire.

Remaineth not,
but to inter our brethren

and with loud alarums
welcome them to Rome.

I n peace and honor
rest you here, my sons,

secure from worldly chances and mishaps.

Here lurks no treason.

Here no envy swells.

Here grow no damned drugs.

Here are no storms,

no noise...

but silence and eternal sleep.

I n peace and honor
rest you here, my sons.

I n peace and honor
live Lord Titus long.

My noble lord and father,
live in fame.

Lo, at this tomb
my tributary tears I render

for my brethren's obsequies.

And at thy feet I kneel,
with tears of joy

shed on the earth
for thy return to Rome.

Bless me here with
thy victorious hand.

Kind Rome,
that hast thus lovingly reserved

the cordial of mine age
to glad my heart.

Lavinia, live.

Outlive thy father's days
and fame's eternal date,

for virtue's praise.

Noble patricians,
patrons of my right,

defend the justice
of my cause with arms!

And, countrymen,
my loving followers,

plead my successive title
with your swords!

Romans, friends, followers,
favorers of my right,

if ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,

were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,

keep, then,
this passage to the capitol!

I am the born-born son!

That was the last that wear
the imperial diadem of Rome.

And suffer not dishonor
to approach the imperial seat:

to virtue, consecrate...

to justice, continence, and nobility!

Then let my father's honors live in me!

Nor wrong mine age
with this indignity!

But let desert
in pure election shine,

and, Romans,
fight for freedom in your choice.

Princes...

that strive by factions
and by friends ambitiously

for rule and empery!

Know that the people of Rome
have by common voice

in elections for the Roman empery
chosen Andronicus.

A nobler man,

a braver warrior, lives not this day
within the city walls.

He by the Senate is
accited home from weary wars

against the barbarous Goths.

Let us entreat,
by honor of his name,

that you withdraw you,
dismiss your followers,

and, as suitors should,
plead your deserts in peace

and humbleness.

Marcus Andronicus...

so I do rely on thy uprightness
and integrity,

and so I love and honor
thee and thine--

thy noble brother Titus and his sons

and her to whom
my thoughts are humbled all,

gracious Lavinia,
Rome's rich ornament--

that I will here dismiss
my loving friends.

And to my fortunes
and the people's favor,

commit my cause
in balance to be weighed.

Friends...

that have been thus forward
in my right,

I thank you all
and here dismiss you all.

And to the love and favor of my country

commit myself, my person,

and the cause!

Rome...

be as just and gracious unto me

as I am confident and kind to thee.

Open the gates and let me in!

Long live Lord Titus,
my beloved brother.

Thanks, gentle Tribune,

noble brother Marcus.

And welcome, nephews,
from successful wars...

you that survive
and those that sleep in fame.

Titus Andronicus,

the people of Rome send thee by me,

their tribune and their trust,

this palliament of white
and spotless hue

and name thee in election
for the empire

with these our late-deceased
emperor's sons.

Be candidatus, then,

and put it on,

and help to set a head
on headless Rome.

A better head her glorious body fits

than this that shakes
for age and feebleness.

Rome, I have been
thy soldier forty years

and led my country's
strength successfully...

and buried one and twenty valiant sons.

Give me a staff of honor for mine age,

but not a scepter to control the world.

Upright he held it, lords,
that held it last.

Titus, thou shalt but ask
and have the empery.

Proud and ambitious Tribune,
canst thou tell?

Patience, Prince Saturnine.

Romans, do me right!

Patricians, draw your swords
and sheathe them not

till Saturninus be Rome's emperor!

Andronicus, would thou
wert shipped to hell

rather than rob me
of the people's hearts!

Proud Saturnine,
interrupter of the good

that noble-minded Titus means to thee.

Content thee, Prince.

I will restore to thee
the people's hearts

and wean them from themselves.

Andronicus,

I do not flatter thee
but honor thee,

and will do till I die.

My faction,
if thou strengthen with thy friends,

I will most thankful be.

People of Rome
and people's tribunes here,

I ask your voices
and your suffrages.

Will you bestow them friendly
on Andronicus?

To gratify the good Andronicus

and gratulate
his safe return to Rome,

the people will accept
whom he admits.

Tribunes, I thank you,
and this suit I make...

that you create
your emperor's eldest son,

Lord Saturnine,
whose virtues will, I hope,

reflect on Rome
as Titan's rays on Earth.

And if you will elect by my advice,

crown him and say,

" Long live our emperor!"

Long live our Emperor Saturnine!

Patricians and plebeians,

we create Lord Saturninus
Rome's great emperor

and say,
" Long live our Emperor Saturnine!"

Titus Andronicus,

for thy favors done to us
in our election this day

I give thee thanks
in part of thy deserts

and will with deeds
requite thy gentleness.

And, for an onset, Titus,

to advance thy name
and honorable family,

Lavinia will I make my empress,

Rome's royal mistress,

mistress of my heart,

and in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.

Tell me, Andronicus,
doth this motion please thee?

Hmm?

It doth, my worthy lord,

and in this match I hold me

highly honored of Your Grace.

And here, in sight of Rome,

to Saturnine, king and commander
of our commonweal,

the wide world's emperor,

do I consecrate my sword,
my chariot, and my prisoners:

presents well worthy
Rome's imperial lord.

Thanks, noble Titus,

father of my life.

How proud I am of thee
and of thy gifts

Rome shall record.

And when I do forget
the least of these unspeakable deserts,

Romans, forget thy fealty to me.

Now, madam,
are you prisoner to an emperor--

to him that,
for your honor and your state,

will use you nobly
and your followers.

Mmm...

a goodly lady.

Trust me,
of the hue that I would choose...

were I to choose anew.

Clear up, fair Queen,
that cloudy countenance.

Though chance of war hath wrought
this change of cheer,

thou comest not to be made
a scorn in Rome.

Princely shall be thy usage...

every way.

Rest on my word,

and let not discontent
daunt all your hopes.

Madam, he that comforts you

can make you greater
than queen of Goths.

Lavinia, you are
not displeased with this?

Not I, my lord,

sith true nobility
warrants these words

in princely courtesy.

Thanks, sweet Lavinia.

Romans, let us go!

Ransomless here we set
our prisoners free.

Proclaim our honors, lords,
with trump and drum.

Lord Titus, by your leave,
this maid is mine!

How, sir!
Are you in earnest, then, my lord?

Ay, noble Titus,
and resolved withal.

This prince in justice
seizeth but his own.

And that he will and shall,
if Lucius live.

Traitors, avaunt!

Where is the emperor's guard?

Treason, my lord,
Lavinia is surprised!

Surprised? By whom?

By him that justly may bear

his betrothed
from all the world away.

Fear not, my lord,
I'll soon bring her back.

Brothers, help to
convey her hence away!

And with my sword
I'll keep this way safe.

My lord, you pass not here.

What, villain boy?

Barr'st me my way in Rome, huh?

Help! Lucius!

My lord!

You are unjust!

And more than so,

in wrongful quarrel,
you have slain your son.

Nor thou nor he
are any sons of mine.

My sons would never so dishonor me.

Traitor!

Restore Lavinia to the emperor.

Dead, if you will,
but not to be his wife

that is another's lawful promised love.

No, Titus, no!

The emperor needs her not!

Nor her, nor thee,
nor any of thy stock!

I'll trust, by leisure,
him that mocks me once.

Thee never!

Nor thy traitorous, haughty sons,

confederates all,
thus to dishonor me.

But go thy ways. Go!

A valiant son-in-law shalt thou enjoy,

one fit to bandy with
thy lawless sons!

And therefore, lovely Tamora,

Queen of Goths,

if thou be pleased with this
my sudden choice,

behold.

I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride

and will create thee
empress of Rome.

Speak, Queen of Goths.

Dost thou applaud my choice?

If Saturnine advance
the queen of Goths,

she will a handmaid be
to his desires,

a loving nurse,
a mother to his youth.

Ascend, fair Queen,
to the Pantheon.

Lords, accompany
your noble emperor

and his lovely bride.

There shall we consummate
our spousal rites.

Titus, when wert thou
wont to walk alone,

dishonored thus
and challenged of wrongs?

O Titus, see.

Oh, see what thou hast done--

in a bad quarrel
slain a virtuous son.

No, foolish Tribune, no.

No son of mine,
nor thou, nor these,

confederates in the deed

that hath dishonored all our family.

But let us give him burial as becomes.

Give Mutius burial with our brethren.

Traitors, away!
He rests not in this tomb.

Here none but soldiers

and Rome's servitors repose in fame--

none basely slain in brawls.

Bury him where you can.
He comes not here.

My lord, this is impiety in you.

He must be buried with his brethren.

And shall, or him we will accompany!

And shall?

What villain was it spake that word?

He that would vouch it
in any place but here.

What, would you bury him in my despite?

No, noble Titus...

but entreat of thee to pardon Mutius

and to bury him.

Marcus, even thou has
struck upon my crest

and, with these boys,
mine honor thou hast wounded.

My foes I do repute you every one,

so trouble me no more,
but get you gone.

He is not with himself.
Let us withdraw.

Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.

Father...

and in that name
doth nature speak...

Dear Father,
soul and substance of us all...

Renowned Titus,
more than half my soul...

Rise, Marcus, rise.

The dismall'st day is this

that e'er I saw,

to be dishonored by my sons in Rome.

Well, bury him!

And bury me the next.

I'll have another.

So, Bassianus,
you have played your prize.

God give you joy, sir,
of your gallant bride.

And you of yours, my lord.

I say no more nor wish no less,

and so I take my leave.

Traitor!

If Rome have law or we have power,

thou and thy faction
shall repent this rape.

Rape call you it, my lord,

to seize my own,
my true-betrothed love,

and now my wife?

But let the laws
of Rome determine all.

Meanwhile, I am possessed
of that is mine.

'Tis good, sir.

You are very short with us.

But if we live,

we'll be as sharp with you.

My lord,
what I have done, as best I may,

answer I must and shall do
with my life.

This noble gentleman--
Lord Titus here--

is in opinion and in honor wronged.

That in the rescue of Lavinia,
with his own hand

did slay his youngest son
in zeal to you.

Receive him then to favor, Saturnine.

Prince Bassianus,

leave to plead my deeds.

'Tis thou and those
that have dishonored me.

Rome and the righteous heavens
be my judge

how I have loved
and honored Saturnine.

I can do no more.

Patience, Bassianus.

My worthy lord,
if ever Tamora were gracious

in those princely eyes of thine,

then hear me speak
indifferently for all.

And at my suit, sweet,
pardon what is past.

What, madam?
Be dishonored openly

and basely put it up
without revenge?

Not so, my lord.
The gods of Rome for fend

I should be author to dishonor you.

But on mine honor dare I undertake

for good Lord Titus'
innocence in all,

whose fury, not dissembled,
speaks his griefs.

Then at my suit
look graciously on him.

Lose not so noble a friend
on vain suppose.

My lord, be ruled by me.

Be won at last.

Dissemble all your griefs
and discontents.

You are but newly planted
in your throne.

Lest then the people
and patricians too,

upon a just survey,
take Titus' part

and so supplant you
for ingratitude.

Yield at entreats,
and let me alone.

I'll find a day
to massacre them all

and raze their faction
and their family--

the cruel father
and his traitorous sons

to whom I sued
for my dear son's life,

and make them know what 'tis to
let a queen kneel in the streets

and beg for grace in vain.

Come, come, sweet Emperor.

Come, Andronicus.

Take up this good old man,
and cheer the heart

that dies in tempest
of thy angry frown.

Rise, Titus, rise.
My empress hath prevailed.

I thank Your Majesty and her, my lord.

And let it be mine honor,
good my lord,

that I have reconciled
your friends and you.

For you, Prince Bassianus,

I have passed my word and promise

to the emperor that you will be

more mild and tractable.

And fear not, lords,
and you, Lavinia.

By my advice,
all humbled on your knees,

you shall ask pardon of His Majesty.

We do, and vow to heaven
and to Your Highness

that what we did
was mildly as we might,

tendering our sister's honor
and our own.

That, on mine honor,
here I do attest.

Away, and talk not.
Trouble us no more.

Nay, nay, sweet Emperor.

We must all be friends.

The tribune and his nephews
kneel for grace.

I will not be denied.

Sweet heart, look back.

Marcus, for thy sake
and thy brother's here,

and at my lovely Tamora's entreats,

I do remit these young men's
heinous faults.

Stand up!

Lavinia, though you left me
like a churl,

I found a friend.

Come.

If the emperor's court
can feast two brides,

you are my guest, Lavinia,
and your friends.

This day shall be
a love-day, Tamora.

Tomorrow,
an it please Your Majesty

to hunt the panther
and the hart with me.

Be it so, Titus,
and gramercy, too.

Now climbeth Tamora
Olympus' top,

safe out of fortune's shot
and sits aloft,

secure of thunder's crack
or lightning flash,

advanced above pale envy's
threatening reach.

As when the golden sun
salutes the morn

and, having gilt the ocean
with his beams,

gallops the zodiac
in his glistering coach

and overlooks
the highest peering hills.

So Tamora.

Upon her wit doth earthly honor wait,

and virtue stoops
and trembles at her frown.

Then, Aaron, arm thy heart
and fit thy thoughts

to mount aloft
with thy imperial mistress

and mount her pitch,
whom thou in triumph

long hast prisoner held
fettered in amorous chains.

Away with slavish weeds
and servile thoughts!

I will be bright and shine
in pearl and gold

to wait upon
this new-made empress.

To wait, said I ?

To wanton with this queen,
this goddess,

this Semiramis, this nymph,

this siren that will charm
Rome's Saturnine

and see his shipwreck
and his commonweal's.

Holloa!

What storm is this?

Chiron,
thy years wants wit.

Thy wit wants edge and manners

to intrude where I am graced

and may, for aught thou knowest,
affected be.

Demetrius, thou dost overween in all,

and so in this,

to bear me down with braves.

'Tis not the difference
of a year or two

makes me less gracious
or thee more fortunate.

I am as able and as fit
as thou to serve

and to deserve my mistress' grace.

That my sword
upon thee shall approve

and plead my passions
for Lavinia's love.

Clubs, clubs!

These lovers will not keep
the peace.

Why, boy,

although our mother, unadvised,

gave you a dancing rapier
by your side,

are you so desperate grown
to threat your friends?

Go to.

Have your lath glued
within your sheath

till you know better
how to handle it.

Meanwhile, sir,

with what little skill I have,

full well thou shalt perceive

how much I dare.

Ay, boy.

Grow ye so brave?

How now, lords!

Here in the emperor's palace
dare you draw

and maintain such a quarrel openly?

Full well I wot
the ground of all this grudge.

I would not for a million of gold

the cause were known to them
it most concerns,

nor would your noble mother
for much more

be so dishonored
in the court of Rome.

For shame, put up.

Not I, till I have sheathed
my rapier in his bosom

and withal thrust these reproachful
speeches down his throat

that he hath breathed
in my dishonor here.

For that I am prepared
and full resolved.

Foul-spoken coward,

that thunderest with thy tongue

and with thy weapon
nothing darest perform.

Away, I say!

Now, by the gods
that warlike Goths adore,

this petty brabble
will undo us all.

Why, lords,
think you not how dangerous it is

to step upon a prince's right?

What, is Lavinia then become so loose

or Bassianus so degenerate
that for her love

such quarrels may be broached
without controlment,

justice, or revenge?

Young lords, beware!

And should the empress know
this discord's ground,

the music would not please.

I care not, I,
knew she and all the world.

I love Lavinia
more than all the world!

Youngling...

learn thou to make
some meaner choice.

Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.

Why, are ye mad?
Or know ye not in Rome

how furious and impatient they be

and cannot brook competitors in love?

I tell you, lords,

you do but plot your deaths
by this device.

Aaron...

a thousand deaths would I propose

to achieve her whom I love.

To achieve her! How?

Why makest thou it so strange?

She's a woman,
and therefore may be wooed.

She's a woman...

Ah!

therefore may be won.

She is Lavinia,

and therefore must be loved.

Why, then, it seems,

some certain snatch or so
would serve your turns.

Ay, so the turn were served.

Aaron, thou hast hit it.

Would you had hit it, too.

Then should not we be tired
with this ado.

Are you such fools
to square for this?

Would it offend you then
that both should speed?

Faith, not me.

Nor me, so I were one.

For shame.

Be friends and join
for that you jar.

'Tis policy and stratagem
must do that you affect.

And I have found the path.

My lords...

a solemn hunting is at hand.

There will
the lovely Roman ladies troop.

Ah, the forest walks
are wide and spacious,

and many unfrequented plots
there are

fitted by kind for rape and villainy.

Single you thither
then this dainty doe

and strike her home by force,

if not by words.

This way, or not at all,
stand you in hope.

Come.

Come. Our empress,
with her sacred wit,

will we acquaint
with all that we intend.

He that had wit
would think that I had none

to bury so much gold under a tree,

never after to inherit it.

Let him that thinks of me
so abjectly know

that this gold must coin
a stratagem which,

cunningly effected,

will beget
a very excellent piece of villainy.

And so repose, sweet gold,
for their unrest

that have their alms
out of the empress' chest.

My lovely Aaron,

wherefore lookst thou sad

when everything doth
make a gleeful boast?

The birds chant melody
on every bush.

The snake lies rolled
in the cheerful sun.

The green leaves quiver
with the cooling wind.

Under their sweet shade,
Aaron, let us sit.

Ha ha ha!

And after conflict, we may,

each wreathed in the other's arms,

our pastimes done,

possess a golden slumber.

Whiles hounds and horns

and sweet, melodious birds be unto us

as is a nurse's song of lullaby

to bring her babe asleep.

Madam, though Venus
govern your desires,

Saturn is dominator over mine.

What signifies my deadly-standing eye,

my silence, and my cloudy melancholy?

No, madam,
these are no venereal signs.

Vengeance is in my heart,

death in my hand.

Blood and revenge are
hammering in my head.

Hark, Tamora,
the empress of my soul,

which never hopes more heaven

than rests in thee...

This is the day of doom
for Bassianus.

Ha ha!

His Philomel must lose
her tongue today.

Thy sons make pillage of her chastity

and wash their hands
in Bassianus' blood.

Seest thou this letter?

Take it up, I pray thee,

and give the king
this fatal-plotted scroll.

Question me no more.
We are espied.

Ah, my sweet Moor,
sweeter to me than life!

No more, great Empress.
Bassianus comes.

Be cross with him,

and I'll go fetch thy sons
to back thy quarrels,

whatsoe'er they be.

Who have we here?

Rome's royal empress,

unfurnished of her
well-beseeming troop?

Or is it Dian, habited like her,

who hath abandoned her holy groves

to see the general hunting
in this forest?

Saucy controller of
our private steps!

Had I the power
some say Dian had,

thy temples should be
planted presently with horns,

as was Actaeon's.

And the hounds should drive upon

thy new-transformed limbs,

unmannerly intruder as thou art!

Under your patience,
gentle Empress.

'Tis thought you have
a goodly gift in horning

and to be doubted
that your Moor and you

are singled forth
to try experiments.

Jove shield your husband
from his hounds today!

'Tis pity they should
take him for a stag.

Why are you sequestered
from all your train,

dismounted from
your snow-white, goodly steed,

and wandered hither to an obscure plot

accompanied but with a barbarous Moor

if foul desire
had not conducted you?

And, being intercepted in your sport,

great reason that my noble lord

be rated for sauciness.

I pray you, let us hence,

and let her 'joy
her raven-colored love.

This valley fits
the purpose passing well.

The king my brother
shall have notice of this.

Good king, to be so mightily abused!

Why have I patience
to endure all this?

Yah!

Aah!

How now, dear sovereign
and our gracious mother!

Why doth Your Highness
look so pale and wan?

Have I not reason,
think you, to look pale?

These two have 'ticed me
hither to this place--

a barren, detested vale,
you see it is.

And when they showed me
this abhorred pit,

they told me here,
at dead time of the night,

a thousand fiends,
a thousand hissing snakes,

ten thousand swelling toads

would make such fearful
and confused cries

as any mortal body hearing it

should straight fall mad
or else die suddenly.

No sooner had they told
this hellish tale

then straight they told me
they would bind me here

and leave me to
this miserable death.

And then...

they called me foul adulteress,

lascivious Goth,

and all the bitterest terms

that ever ear
did hear to such effect.

And had you not
by wondrous fortune come,

this vengeance on me
had they executed.

Revenge it,
as you love your mother's life,

or be ye not henceforth
called my children.

This is a witness
that I am thy son.

And this for me,
struck home to show my strength.

Ay.

Come, Semiramis!

Nay, barbarous Tamora,

for no name fits thy nature
but thy own!

Give me the poniard.

Your mother's hand shall right
your mother's wrong.

Stay, madam.

Here is more belongs to her.

First thrash the corn,
then after burn the straw.

This minion stood upon her chastity,

upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,

and with that painted hope
she braves your mightiness.

And shall she carry this
unto her grave?

And if she do,

I would I were a eunuch.

Ha ha ha ha!

Drag hence her husband
to some secret hole

and make his dead trunk
pillow to our lust.

But when ye have
the honeyye desire,

let not this wasp
outlive us all to sting.

I warrant you, madam,
we will make that sure.

Come, mistress.

Now perforce we will enjoy

that nice preserved honesty of yours.

O Tamora,
thou bearest a woman's face--

I will not hear her speak.

Away with her.

Sweet lords,
entreat her hear me but a word.

Oh, listen, fair madam.

Let it be your glory
to see her tears,

but be your heart to them

as unrelenting flint
to drops of rain.

When did the tiger's young ones
teach the dam?

Oh, do not learn her wrath.

She taught it thee?

The milk thou suckst from her
did turn to marble.

Yet every mother
breeds not sons alike.

Do thou entreat her
show a woman's pity.

What, wouldst thou have me
prove myself a bastard?

Oh, be to me,
though thy hard heart say no,

nothing so kind,
but something pitiful!

I know not what it means.
Away with her.

Let me teach thee!

For my father's sake
that gave thee life

when well he might
have slain thee!

Hadst thou in person
never offended me,

even for his sake am I pitiless.

Remember, boys,
I poured forth tears in vain

to save your brother
from the sacrifice,

but fierce Andronicus
would not relent.

Therefore away with her.
Use her as you will.

The worse to her,
the better loved of me.

Tamora, be called a gentle queen,

and with thine own hands
kill me in this place!

And tumble me into
some loathsome pit

where never man's eye
may behold my body.

Do this,
and be a charitable murderer.

So should I rob
my sweet sons of their fee?

No.

Let them satisfy
their lust on thee.

Away! For thou hast
stayed us here too long.

No grace? No womanhood?!

Aaah! Beastly creature!

Confusion fall!

Nay!
I'll stop your mouth!

Farewell, my sons.
See that you make her sure.

Ne'er let my heart know
merry cheer indeed

till all the Andronici be made away.

Now will I hence
to seek my lovely Moor

and let my spleenful sons
this trull deflower.

Come on, my lords,
the better foot before.

Straight will I bring you
to the loathsome pit

where I espied
the tiger fast asleep.

My sight is very dull,
whate'er it bodes.

And mine, I promise you.

Were it not for shame,

well could I leave
our sport to sleep awhile.

Aaah!

What, art thou fallen?

What subtle hole is this...

whose mouth is covered
with rude-growing briers,

upon whose leaves are drops
of new-shed blood?

Speak, Brother.
Hast thou hurt thee with the fall?

O Brother, with the
dismall'st object hurt

that ever eye with sight
made heart lament.

Why dost not comfort me

and help me out of
this unhallowed

and bloodstained hole?

My heart suspects more
than mine eye can see.

To prove thou hast
a true-divining heart,

Aaron and thou look down into this den

and see a fearful sight
of blood and death.

Aaron is gone!

Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,

all on a heap...

like to a slaughtered lamb.

O Brother, help me!

I have not strength
to pluck thee to the brink!

Aaah!

Along with me.

I'll see what hole is here,

and what he is that now
is leapt into it.

Say!

Who art thou that lately didst descend

into this gaping hollow
of the earth?

The unhappy sons of old Andronicus...

brought hither in a most unlucky hour

to find thy brother Bassianus dead!

My brother dead?

I know thou dost but jest.

He and his lady
both are at the lodge.

'Tis not an hour
since I left him there.

Where is my lord the king?

Here, Tamora...

though grieved with killing grief.

And where is thy brother Bassianus?

Now to the bottom dost
thou search my wound.

Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.

Oh, then all too late
I bring this fatal writ.

"And if we miss
to meet him handsomely--

sweet huntsman Bassianus 'tis we mean--

do thou so much as dig
the grave for him.

Thou know'st our meaning.

Look for thy reward...

among the nettles at the elder tree

which overshades
the mouth of that same pit

where we decreed to bury Bassianus.

Do this and purchase us
thy lasting friends."

O Tamora! Was ever heard the like?

This is the pit
and this the elder tree.

Look, sirs,
if you can find the huntsman out

that should have murdered
Bassianus here.

My gracious lord...

here is the bag of gold.

Two of thy whelps,

fell curs of bloody kind,

have here bereft
my brother of his life!

Sirs, drag them from the pit
unto the prison.

There let them bide
until we have devised

some never-heard-of
torturing pain for them.

High Emperor,

upon my feeble knee I beg this boon

with tears not lightly shed
that this fell fault

of my accursed sons...

accursed, if the fault
be proved in them--

If it be proved?!

You see it is apparent!

Who found this letter?

Tamora, was it you?

Andronicus himself did take it up.

I did, my lord.

Yet let me be their bail,

for by my father's reverend tomb I vow

they shall be ready
at Your Highness' will

to answer their suspicion
with their lives.

Thou shalt not bail them!

See thou follow me.

Some bring the murdered body,
some the murderers.

Let them not speak a word!
The guilt is plain!

For by my soul,

were there worse end than death,

that end upon them
should be executed.

Andronicus,
I will entreat the king.

Fear not thy sons.
They shall do well enough.

Come, Lucius, come.
Stay not to talk with them.

So now go tell--
an if thy tongue can speak--

who 'twas that cut thy tongue
and ravished thee.

Write down thy mind,

bewray thy meaning so,

and if thy stumps
will let thee,

play the scribe.

See how with signs and tokens
she can scrowl.

Go home!
Call for sweet water.

Sweet water!
Hither, sweet water!

Wash thy hands!

She hath no tongue to call

nor hands to wash!

And so let's leave her
to her silent walks.

And 'twere it my case,
I should go hang myself...

if thou hadst hands
to help thee knit the cord.

Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

Who is this?

My niece?

If I do dream,

would all my wealth
would wake me.

If I do wake,

some planet strike me down

that I may slumber
in eternal sleep.

Speak...

gentle Niece.

What stern, ungentle hands
have lopped

and hewed and made thy body bare
of her two branches?

Those...

sweet ornaments...

whose circling shadows
kings have sought to sleep in.

Why dost not speak to me?

Come.

Let us go...

and make thy father blind,

for such a sight
will blind a father's eye.

An hour's storm will drown
the fragrant meads.

What will whole months of tears
thy father's eyes?

Do not draw back,
for we will mourn with thee.

Oh, could our mourning
ease thy misery!

Hear me, grave fathers!
