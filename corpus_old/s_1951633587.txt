Captain's Log stardate 47249, Commander
Chode speaking, we're nearing the end...

of our five hour mission to deliver
prophylactics to the oversexed...

Excuse me.
What?

Who are you talking to?

Ships recorder.

Oh it's broken.

Then what the hell have you been fixing
these last two days?

The transdigital Freon converter.

And what's that for?

It makes ice cubes.

You mean to tell me,
with all the crap that's broken on this ship...

you start with the fucking ice machine?!

Listen to me you fat purple dung pile,...

as the ships engineer
I decide what gets fixed first...

Oh no...

So if you don't like it go screw yourself!

I'm the captain! And that does it,
Come here! Come here!

Now now, hold on a minute.

Now you've had this coming for a long time!
I said get over here!

Oh you want a piece of me,
bring it on!

...oh this is fair.

Yeah!!... uhhh! ...yellow metal...

...goddamn... idiot... bastard

Now fix the fucking hyperdrive!
Oh hello Six.

Captain, you know how fighting with Gus
irritates your irritable bowel syndrome.

Oh, would you like a hand job?

No, no thank-you Six. That'd be nice
but I'm too pissed off to enjoy it anyway!

Are you sure.
I think I could change your mind.

Now I've got you!

I told you we were facing the wrong way.

But sir, you said nothing.

Oh yeah, bloody vengeance!

Where do you know this guy from?

Oh, hi, uhh, yeah well he and I
were in prison a while back, you know...

Oh, don't tell me, judging by his size
I'd say you were the bitch, am I right?


Who are you?

Uh nobody.

Alright Bobo breath,
lets get this over with.

Alright lets.

Whoa, whoa, whoa! How about fighting
without using your faggot clown powers son?

Very well, faggot clown powers indeed.

If he starts to win, shoot him.

Yes sir.

Come on you lip stick wearing stilch monkey.

Bastard!

Never underestimate
the power of a dark clown.

Hey mister clown, I know better ways
for you to, occupy your time.

Madame, clowns are quite disciplined
when it comes to sins of the...

I'm waiting!

Stay here, I'll kill you later.

...ohhh it's been so long.
