Can I get a table?
Yeah, sure.

Just we're closing soon, all right?

You're Roscoe, right?

Yeah, that's right.
Who's asking?

No one.
I just heard all about you.

A real pool shark.
All those tournaments you won.

Why don't you go to table 12,
seems like it's racked already.

Go ahead.

Nah. Don't worry about it.

Just get me on the way back.

Okay.

'Cause I am a part of you

'Cause I live

The life that you wanted to

You know what you swear

In air, a tribulation

And I held you close

Gathering all your faces...

You know, you're not bad.
I've been watching you.

Can you play one game?
I had such a long day.

I gotta get going, man.
How about 300?

That make you stay a little longer?

A little longer?

It's about all it's gonna take, kid.

Kid?
Rack 'em up.

# 'Cause I am a part of you

# 'Cause I live

# The life that you wanted to...

Not bad.

"Not bad"?
I just smoked you, kid.

Again with the "kid."

I only call people I like "kid."

Remember your friend Angel?

Your boy you put away?
Well, he says hello.

What do you want from me?

This way I don't forget you.

Make shit sure not
to forget me, douchebag.

This one's for me.

Rats... I got no use for them.

Who does?
Who does but the feds?

If I had it my way,

every one of them would burn in hell.

# There is no rhyme

# I want to watch it burn

# There is no reason

# No lesson learned

# Melting glass

# Melting bone

# Bringing death
to your happy home

# I look like you,
the perfect crime

# There will be no savior
from the flame

# I want to watch

# The world burn

# And laugh while

# I fan the flames

# I want to watch the world burn

# And fan the flames

# With gasoline.

What a shame.

Fucking shame.

I'm sorry, Dad.
I know it hurts.

Think I'll just stick around here
for a while, okay?

The life.

You know what I'm talking about.

Either the feds catch up to you
when you wind up behind the wall

or your own kind turns on you.

Maybe you even wind up
under the ground

like some of these poor bastards.

I thought it could
be different for me.

But I was wrong.

Dead wrong.

Russo.

Just watching Mr. Baldano & Sons.

Yeah. Same routine, different day.

You gotta try and let go.

Stop blaming yourself.

It's not your fault.

You did everything
you possibly could do.

With a son like that,
he's gotta be dirty.

I can feel it in my bones.

I wanna nail that son of a bitch.

I know, Angela.

I know.
I know he doesn't like surprises,

but I got this big welcome-home dinner
planned for him at the house.

I just... I want things to get
off to a good start, you know?

A new beginning for him.
It would be really nice.

It's just time he came
and worked for his father, okay?

I mean, Joseph's really got
his heart set on it this time.

And I think Bobby could
really do all right for himself.

Legitimately.

What, no luggage?

Where do you think I was,
on vacation?

I want nothing
from over that bridge.

Come here, you crazy bastard.

Welcome back.

We missed you.

Where's your brother?

Bobby Baldano.

Oh, it's good to see you,
you son of a gun.

How you doing, Lenny?
Good good.

I knew you'd make me
your first stop.

You know that.
You look a little thirsty.

Let me get you a nice cold one.

I'm gonna join you.
Here's that.

All right.

Salute.
Benza salute. Chin down.

Hey, Big Al, Look who's here.
Hey, Bobby.

How you doing, Al?
When you'd get out?

This morning.
This morning?

You're still around?
Hey, where am I gonna go?

That's good.
'Cause now that I'm out,

I might call on you for something.

You still got my number, right?

Right here.

Lenny, buy him a drink.

Get me a Captain and ginger too.

Where's all the girls?
Don't worry about the girls.

He's just with the boys
having a drink.

He's gonna be here.
It's his first day. Come on.

He'll be back.

Wait. What are you all doing?

Let's just wait a couple of minutes
for Bobby to get home

and then we'll all eat
together like we used to.

I mean,
is that too much to ask for?

Anyways, salute again.

Hey hey hey, look who's here.
Good, plenty of money.

Hey, what's up?

Here come...
the broads come and you clam up.

Okay, but just the antipasto.

Bobby could be home
in a couple of minutes

and I want him
to eat the whole meal

with all of us, just like a family.

The iceman cometh. Whoa!

I've been passing
the time, the time...

Somebody pass the grated cheese.

There you go.

I'm here for you...

Go, Bobby! Go, Bobby!

# And I've been passing
the time, the time

# Living my life

# Waiting for you

# I've been passing
the time, the time

# Living my life

# Waiting for you

Maybe something happened.

Maybe you should go back
to Lenny's and check, Joey.

Hey, Sarah...

nothing happened.

Bobby is just being Bobby.

Mom.

My family... I love them.

They love me.

But I've disappointed 'em

more times than I can remember.

My father...

I know he thinks I'm a fuck-up.

What the fuck.
Maybe I am.

Drone!

Drone!

No! Freaking no!

My apartment?
In better shape than I left it.

You know my mother's
responsible for that.

Boxing.

There was a time
it was all I thought about.

But I was too addicted
to the streets...

the high I got from taking
what wasn't mine.

All right, ladies, wrap it up.

Come on.
Bang, Bobby, bang.

Baldano, that means you too.

Fucking COs.

Yo, Bobby,
You gonna take care

of that thing for me on
the outside like you said?

You're not gonna
let me down, are you, bro?

We've been cellmates
for a long time.

I won't let you down, Angel.

You know how I feel about rats.

Last time I'm gonna say this...
get it moving.

Let's go.
Get it moving.

You gonna take care
of that thing for me

on the outside like you said?

You're not gonna
let me down, are you, bro?

Remember your friend Angel?

Your boy you put away?
Well, he says hello.

Revenge is something that can
eat away at you like a cancer...

This way I don't forget you.

Make shit sure not
to forget me, douchebag.

...until you get it.

Your revenge.

Then... then you can live.

No.

Gimme that fucking thing.

That fucking spaz.
You got it.

I'm beating myself.
Unbelievable.

Yeah, I'd like to beat you.

I got winner.
Ho! Fucking Bobby.

These were my best friends, my crew.

Guys I could trust with my life.

Me? Look at you.
Lean and mean.

I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Come here, Stan.

I figured I'd find
you guys at the park.

You think those bastards
could've put us together?

No, they had to separate us all.

Well, we're all here now.

What really pisses me off

is that prick Johnny writing a book.

You read it?
No.

I look at the cover every day.

I won't open it.
I can't bring myself to read that.

Yeah, well,
I read the fucking thing.

Our names are
splattered all over it.

We should go and do
this motherfucker.

Maybe one day we will.

Now that we were all out,

all we cared about was
starting to earn again

and maybe one day

getting back at the punks
who put us away.

I'm telling you, that's him.

Are you sure?
Isn't he still away?

I'm telling you,
that is Bobby Baldano.

Who's Bobby Baldano?
Don't worry about it.

Why don't you girls order us
another round of drinks?

We'll be right back.
Come on, Mario.

Let's go say hello.

Hey, man.

You Bobby Baldano, ain't you?

I mean, come on.
You're Bobby, right? You're him?

Hey, Ray, why don't you
do yourself a favor, huh?

Go back to your booth,
pay some attention to your date.

She's looking a little bored.
Whoa. All I wanna do

is shake the man's hand,
buy him a drink or something.

Come on, I'm not
a fucking jerk-off here, Lenny.

All you wanna do
is shake my hand?

Yeah, man, that's it.

Look, I heard a lot
of good shit about you, man.

I've been dying to meet you.
You're Ray, right?

Yeah, man.

Oh, you met him.
You happy now?

Go back to your date.
Hey, shut up, Lenny.

Shut up?
Yeah.

Hey, yo, I read that book...

the one that talks about
you and your friends...

three times.

I read it three fucking times.

Huh? Some crazy shit.
You know what I'm talking...

yo, we got a lot of good shit
going on ourselves.

We're around Slick Sally.

Don't know a Slick Sally.

Well, they used
to call him Fat Sally.

I don't know a Fat Sally.

Come on, man.
You know him.

I said I don't know him.

Yo, Fat Sally?

Man, how could you
not know...

Oh! Hey, come on! What are you...
come on, Bobby, take it easy.

What the fuck? What's wrong with you?
Have a drink.

Let's all relax.
Hey, what'd you go and do that f...

wait till Sally
hears about this shit.

I don't give a fuck
what you tell Fat Sally.

I don't care
who you're around.

To me you're a dumb fuck
with a big mouth.

Now go back over there
before you have a real problem.

Fucking kids.

Dropping names
like fucking aspirins.

Yeah.

Just one look

That's all it took...

Hey, Patsy.

Oh, ain't this my lucky day?

Look who came to see Patsy.

So you got a few more
under your belt, huh?

Hey, it is what it is.

We all gotta do some time
sooner or later

to keep this thing of ours alive.

Lemme ask you something...

what happened
at Leone's the other night?

Why'd you slap
that kid Ray in the face?

He told you he was
with Slick Sally.

Who the hell is Slick Sally?

Don't play stupid with me, Bobby.

The kid told you he was
talking about Fat Sally.

Fat Sally and Slick Sally
are the same guy.

He had that rubber-band operation
or whatever the fuck you call it

when they try
to lose weight right away.

The point is he ain't
so fat anymore.

I think the kid had a big mouth,
dropping his name like that, Patsy.

Ray is like
a kid brother to Sally.

Sally took him under his wing,
just like Tommy did with you.

Sally's a captain now.
You'd better get used to this, Bobby.

You're kidding me.
He's Teddy Vesca's son,

and he's in the kitchen, so...

Well, he ain't nothing
like his father. You know that.

You're talking
about a skipper, Bobby.

That's enough.
I don't wanna hear anymore.

And you're gonna
have to report to him.

He's your captain. That's it.
All right, Patsy.

Whatever you say.
Carmine!

Sally, he wants to see ya.

It's Slick Sally now, Carmine,

not just "Sally."

How many times I gotta
tell these fucking guys?

Don't go nowhere.
Watch this sauce.

Sure, no problem.

What's up, P?
Sally, have a seat.

Sorry about your boy there.

Just a little misunderstanding.
Yeah, right.

So what are we gonna do
about this, Patsy?

Come on. This kid just got
outta the can. He's feeling antsy.

You guys need
to put this behind you.

Let's move on, okay?

All right.
Whatever you say, P.

We were gonna go down the block
to get a couple of heroes

from Jon's Deli
while the sauce cooked.

I'm too hungry.
I can't wait.

You know what?
I'll take a walk with you, Sally.

Now that's a good idea.

Why don't you do that?
You guys go take a walk.

But I was gonna drive.
Drive?

It's a fucking block away.

Walk.

You know, that kid Ray is
like a younger brother to me.

You really
embarrassed him, Bobby.

I think he embarrassed himself,
dropping your name like that.

I mean, don't you think
he should've known better

with the feds all over the place
in this neighborhood?

Don't gimme that shit, Bobby, okay?

I know you never liked me.

You're lucky you only smacked him,

because otherwise there would've been
some real consequences.

Really?

Like what kind of consequences?

Let's just go get the heroes.

No, I'd really like
to know what kind

of consequences we're
talking about here, Sally.

Look, I'm a fucking
captain now, Bobby.

Do you know what that means?

Or do I have to spell it out for you?

Well, I know
what it don't mean...

it don't mean shit,
not in this alley.

Did that hurt, Fat Sally?

Oh, I forget...
it's Slick Sally now, right?

Captain?

You may have Patsy fooled,
but I know what you're made of.

If you breathe
a word of this to him,

you're a dead man.
Better yet,

I'll tell him
you called Patsy "the pirate"

behind his back.
No.

He'd shoot you himself.

No. No, please don't, Bobby.
Please.

Please.
You gotta be kidding me.

You believe that shit?

A captain...

a fucking captain

pissing his pants.

Well, I don't know
why things changed,

but here's the real deal

about this overrated
underworld life.

As a federal agent,

I've been watching
the mob since day one,

so I was right in the heart of things

when Bobby Baldano crossed over.

got straightened out,
got his badge.

He was the youngest guy
to ever get made

in the Carana family.

By his late 20s,

he had established himself
as an earner

and a loyal soldier
amongst a dying breed.

He learned from the best...

and the worst,
if you know what I mean.

Tommy Bono...

he was the underboss
of the family at the time.

He kinda took Bobby
under his wing.

Tommy was old school

and all about business.

He was likeable.
People liked Tommy.

Didn't have many enemies.

That was the boss...
Vinny Morello.

Vinny was a good guy,

but I can't say
the same for his son.

You all know why you're here.

This is the biggest honor
you can have in this life.

You will now be a part of us.

You all know the rules.

If called upon,
you will drop everything.

We are your family.

We come before anything,

even your own family.

May you burn in hell
if you deceive anyone in this family.

These guys took themselves
very seriously.

...or talk about the secrets
of our lives in any shape or form...

And we were very serious
about bringing them down...

...my soul will burn in hell.

...one way or another.

You're all now a part of us...

la familia.

What I don't get

is there are some guys
who go into this life

knowing if they get caught
they're gonna rat.

They just know it.
They're like, "What the fuck?

Let me do this as long as I can.

If I get caught,

I bring down whoever
I have to to get off."

Come on, let's go.
Let's get this over with.

I have a haircut appointment.
I'd really like to make it.

You and your fucking haircuts, Stan.

You've got a weird-shaped head.

Maybe you should grow
your hair longer to hide that.

Plus, with this shnozole,
maybe longer hair

would make it look smaller
or something.

You're very funny, Jimmy.
You should take that on the road.

Let's do this, Jimmy.

All right, everybody freeze!

You, fill this bag up!
Fill it up! Fill it up!

On the ground! Pronto!
Quickly!

Pick up the pace!
Don't touch the alarm!

Come on, move it!
Quickly. Let's go. Quickly.

Get the money, let's go!
Get the money!

You too!
Quickly. Now!

Quickly! Move!
Move your ass!

Don't touch the alarm.
Don't touch the alarm.

All right, we're outta here.
Have a nice day.

That's the way we did things...

one, two, three.

Jobs were like a joke to us.

We actually had fun doing that.

You're like a little girl.
You know that?

What? It's not like
they make 'em easy to open.

Just give me this
fucking thing, will ya?

These guys used to rip 'em
right out of the ground.

But of course,
no one ever saw them...

so they weren't
an easy bunch to nail.

Jackpot.

We made our scores,
kept our mouths shut,

and minded our own business.

We didn't want
to draw attention to ourselves.

We didn't care
about impressing anyone.

On the other hand,
not everyone was like us.

There's Johnny Morello and his crew.

Hey, girls, if you're good,

I'll take you
for a ride in my Caddy.

That's right. Huh?

That's Mario Bruno,

also known as Mario Casanova.

What, you don't like Caddies?

He thought he was
God's gift to women.

You know what? Go.

But I heard he couldn't
even get it up.

Get the fuck outta here.
Fuck you.

Call us when you get a real car.

Come on.
Assholes.

What did you do that for, Mario?
Those girls were hot.

And Mikey, a real punk,

a real wannabe.

Ah, they were pigs.
They're all pigs.

Come on, let's go gambling.

Baldano and his crew,

they were low profile...

not the norm at the time.

But you could always find
these guys flaunting their stuff.

I mean look at this,

putting it out there like that?

These guys weren't very bright.

Almost makes you laugh.

How low can you go?

In spite of them,

it was all going well for us.

We had things under control.

We were keeping a safe distance away
from those morons.

and we were making damn good money.
Here you go.

We were planning a score
that would hold us over for years.

No polish on the socks.
A really big score.

Give it a good shine there.
It was gonna be our thing...

Good, kid.
Hey, Pete.

Hey, Bobby.
...or so we thought.

Hey, Tommy.
Hey.

You wanted to see me?
Hey, hello, Bobby. Yeah, I do.

Hold on one second.
Hey, kid, hold on a second.

Hold on.
Go get us a couple of coffees.

You know how I drink 'em, right?
Uh-huh.

Here. And buy yourself
a Yoo-hoo or something,

a soda. I take change.
Okay.

And don't forget.
Okay.

Hey, Bobby,

you've been earning
pretty good out there lately.

I'm very proud of you.

And we all know that you've got
something big planned,

so Vinny would like for you

to bring his son and his crew
with you on this one,

you know, just for backup.
Actually, Tommy...

no disrespect to Mr. Morello...

we've pretty much got things covered.

We don't need any backup.

Extra guys on this job

just make it that much riskier.

Riskier?
I'm offering you backup.

It's just that... I mean

you know what you're
dealing with with these guys.

Hey, listen, I know what you're
talking about. They're screw-ups,

but he's the boss's son.
You have no choice.

He should be here any minute.
Put your masks on.

I don't want any chance
of getting made.

Hey, what did I say?
Put your mask on.

All right.
Don't fuck this up, huh?

Okay, take it easy.

Here he comes now.

Mr. Klein?

I have a delivery
for an Eleanor Klein.

It's kinda heavy.

Yeah, that's my wife...

always spending.

Can you bring it in here for me?

Yeah, sure, no problem.

Whoa whoa.
What's going on?

Stay there!

Okay. Okay.
Don't move!

Okay, hotshot,
where's the safe?

Take us to the safe. Let's go.
The safe.

Let's go, you fuck!

Okay okay.
Let's go, let's go.

Up the stairs. Come on, let's go!
All right, don't push.

Go on.
That's it, go on!

Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

What are you talking
about "enjoy," huh?

Hey, don't fuck up.
Don't fuck around.

Remember what they said.
Take it easy.

Gotta take the rock, sweetheart,

but I left you the band, okay?

Man, how's a guy like that

get a broad like you?

Oh, lemme guess...

unlimited access

to those shiny little rocks of his, huh?

I bet you he even paid
for those two beauties.

What are you doing? What are
you doing? I said cut that shit out.

C'mon! Stop that. Cut that shit out.
Fuck those guys.

You're real tough with that gun in
your hand and that mask on your face.

Are you so ugly you're afraid
to show your face?

Ugly?

Me?
Yeah.

You know
what they call me?

They call me
Mario Casanova, baby.

What are you doing?
What is the matter with you?

You just told her your name.

Oh shit.
I'm sorry, Johnny.

Shit.
Now we're fucked.

Sorry, baby. I gotta do this.

Let's go, let's go!
The fuck are you doing?!

You heard what he said...
out the door!

What is this?
It's her ring.

Gimme this fucking thing.
Come on, get out.

Don't move!
Barry!

Barry, come down!

Barry! Barry, I'm...

Wow. Beautiful.

That is a lot of glass.
What do you think, Stan?

These are some serious stones.

My guy's all ready for 'em.
You just say the word.

We'll get this sold, have your money
for you within a week.

Beautiful.
Great doing business with ya.

Yeah, for the first and last time.

What? What the hell
you talking about,

"first and last time"?
Come on.

We've got a good thing going on.
We do.

You don't wanna ruin it.
Definitely, Mario.

Bobby, what the fuck?
He got what he deserved.

Next time tell him
to leave his dick at home

before he goes on a job.
Bobby, you can't be serious.

Are you kidding me? I think
you're a little bit out of line here.

Out of line?
Johnny, let it go.

Hey, guys,
we made the score, right?

You guys are gonna get every dime
you got coming to you next week.

Besides, Johnny,
if your father heard

about how this jerk-off
handled himself in there,

he would have his ass.

And probably yours, too,
for bringing him along.

I think that you should probably

just forget about
this little incident and move on.

I ain't forgetting shit, Jimmy!
Mario, shut up.

Shut up! Shut up.
Fuck you, Bobby!

Bobby, Jimmy,
I'll talk to you guys next week.

That's how you handle
punks like that.

Al, make sure they leave.

Of course we had
to pay tribute to the boss,

Vinny Morello, and Tommy.
He had it coming.

Splitting the rest of take
with those assholes

didn't sit too well with us.

Enough time had gone by

for these two morons
to mess up big time.

They were selling cocaine
behind the boss's back.

The best part?

Their biggest customer...

was one of us.

Do you realize you're looking
at 20 years, Bruno?

20 fucking years.

Mario starts crying
when the feds tell him

he's looking at 20. Crying!

It only took this reject

a few minutes to start yapping.

Ah. My favorite.
It gives me energy.

But once he started...
So like I was saying...

...you couldn't stop him.

FBI! FBI!
What the fuck?!

Freeze!
Don't even think about it, Johnny.

All right, all right.
Don't shoot.

What? What? What do
you guys want from me? Huh?

What do you guys wanna know?

Nabbing those punks helped us

get close to who
we really wanted...

Vinny Morello and Tommy Bono.

What do you guys
want me to do, huh?

Hmm? You want me
to cooperate, I'll cooperate.

Just... you guys gotta
cut me a deal though.

Just cut me a deal.

Paulo, don't take too much off
like you did the last time.

Yeah, a little bit...
a little bit off the back.

They could've threatened us
with the electric chair.

None of us would've flipped.

They were just dying
for one of us to turn

on Vinny Morella and Tommy Bono.

Well, Johnny took care of that.

# In the middle too...

# If you keep it up now, darling...

# It'll be the death of you

# You'd better wise up

# Listen to your priest

# If you don't change...

Shit.
Shit.

Just like I said,

there are people who go into this
knowing if they get caught...

they're gonna say
what they gotta say

and sign what they gotta sign

until they cut themselves a deal.

# Circle up the wagons

# Dark circles under your eyes

# The buzzards are circling

# Waiting for their prize.

They gave Tommy 18 years.

He died when he was
barely into his sentence.

He got cancer that was treatable.

Nurse. Nurse.

Just like Tommy said...
Water.

...when you get sick in prison,
you're done.

Water.
They made him suffer.

Water. Water.

# I'll never be the same again

# That's for certain

# Broken up and hollowed out...
Lenny.

Yeah?
Who's that girl?

Oh, her name is Rena.
She's a neighborhood girl.

She was here the night
you smacked that punk Ray.

So what did you tell her about me?

Nothing.
What was I gonna tell her?

She's pretty hot.

Nah, she's not pretty hot.

She's smoking hot.

Send over a drink.

All right.

The gentleman would like
to buy you two lovely ladies a drink.

Thanks, Lenny.

You got it, Rena.

Do your thing, Casanova.

Come on, chop chop.

He's coming over.

I think I'm gonna go
to the ladies room.

Thanks for the drink.
Hey, no problem.

So what's your name?
Come on.

You already know my name.

What, did Lenny rat me out?

So you know my name too?
As a matter of fact, I do.

Rena. It's a real nice name.
Thanks.

You know, last time I was here,

I saw you smack Ray.

He was pretty embarrassed.
Well, he deserved it.

What are you,
some kind of tough guy?

Come on, cut it out.

# Roll over me, over me

# Still blue water

# Still blue water...

Hey, mister, peel out!

Wow!

Give us a little more time
and I just might

be willing to help you
break that dry streak.

Trust me,
it'll be worth the wait.

I can't take it.

Prison.

These guys go in dysfunctional

and they come out worse.

Joey, how long I know you?

All my life, right?

So I'm gonna be
honest with you.

What are you gonna do
about your son Bobby?

Always getting in trouble.

How many times you gonna stick
your neck out for this kid, huh?

You built a name up for yourself.

You got yourself an empire

and he's gonna fuck it up big time.

He goes back,
they're gonna throw away the keys.

I'm glad I'm not in your shoes...

kid like that.

All I'm saying, Joey,
if he's gonna listen to anybody,

he's gonna listen to you.

You hear me?
You're the only one

he's gonna listen to.

No, but my love is singing.
It's what I wanna do.

Unfortunately, I do work
as a cocktail waitress for now.

But singing is what I wanna do.

I never met a chick
who sang before.

Chick?
Well...

you know what I mean.

But since you asked,
I've been singing

since I was a kid.
I studied for years.

What about you?
What were you in for?

What are you gonna do now?

I heard your father's
a construction bigwig.

You gonna go work for him?

I'm telling you I've been watching
the guy all morning.

It's like he don't even care.

The fucking balls on this guy.

Well, if I gotta come down there

and make my presence known,
that's what I'm gonna do.

Glenn, I'm not paying $55 an hour

so this clown can go sell
high school students drugs!

Hey, how long we known
each other, Glenn?

No, 34 years to be exact.

Why is it... isn't it redundant

I have to send
three required letters

to your union now?
That's right!

High school students,
that's correct.

I wanna tell you something.

If he's not off my site
by 6:.00 Monday morning,

put on a nice suit.

'Cause you're gonna be
on the 6:.00 news Monday night.

Hi honey.

Hi.

What's wrong, Joseph?

10:00. You haven't
even had any dinner.

I brought you some.

I'm not even hungry.

What is it, Joseph?

You haven't been yourself.

Well, it's Bobby.

I know what you want for him.

I know what I want for him.

But I just can't figure out
what Bobby wants for himself.

Now that's the only way
to erect a crane, Danny.

Just know it's appreciated.

Bobby, how you doing?
Hey, guys.

Hey, Bobby, welcome home.

How's it going?

Hey, Bobby.

You decide to take the plunge?

What plunge?
Come on.

Play stupid with me.

You know what I'm talking about.

You should be at work
here with me right now.

Come on.
I'll sponsor you right now.

I'll get your book.

Be a shop steward, project manager,
super... whatever you wish.

Better yet, work by my side

at the company, from the office.
I don't know, Dad.

Why not?

I've got some other things
in the works.

You know I like to do my own thing.
Your own thing, huh?

You back in touch with Perotti?

What are you talking about?
Maybe you should speak

to the people that own
your own thing, Bobby.

Tell 'em to give it back to you,
you know, free and clear.

Pop, what are you talking about?

Would you consider my offer?

Would you give me that?
Yeah yeah.

I'll think about it.
I really will.

Listen, I'm gonna get going.

I just stopped by to say hello.

Oh.

You'd better get it right this time.

Straighten out your act.

All right, Pop.

The evidence at hand

To know they're not my shoes

She said,
"If there's..."

Wait wait, you said you wanted
to hear me sing, right?

The evidence at hand...

I spent every penny
I saved making it.

It's my demo.

This is the song I want to make

a music video out of one day.

# I play the fool

# I sold myself...

So what do you think?

Do you think you can handle me?

# Come on

# I know you can't
resist my touch

# Feels like much too much

# Come on

# Baby, baby, let's not fight

# Let's make love tonight

# You can't fight it

# No escape

# Feel the touch of my skin

# You can't hide it

# It's too late

# You know you want to give in

# I can feel you want me so

# Close your eyes

# And just let go

# Come on...

# Come back around,
I know you can...

# Come back around,
I know you can...

Rena was a distraction,

but a good one.

What really mattered though

was making room
for my crew again...

which meant cleaning up this mess.

Patsy, we gotta do
something about this guy.

He's out there planning jobs
without even contacting me.

He hasn't reported to me
once since he come out.

I mean, did you tell him
I was gonna be his captain?

Sally, Sally, I told him.

And then he goes and steals

Ray's girlfriend from him.

First he goes and smacks him
and makes a fool of him,

and then he goes and picks
the girl up in the same place.

I mean, that's not right, Patsy.

Sally, that's enough, okay?
The kid's just trying to earn

just to get back into my good graces.

And do you really think I give
a fuck about Ray's girlfriend?

He's embarrassed.

He's not even showing
his face around.

You know, I think
they wrapped that rubber band

around your balls
instead of your stomach.

And they must've
wrapped it too tight,

because you ain't thinking right.

This kid could be a real loose cannon
if you provoke him, Sally.

I'm telling you now... just relax.

Don't go talking
about him to anybody,

because he'll find out
then you got problems.

All right, listen to me.

Sally, you can't provoke him.
