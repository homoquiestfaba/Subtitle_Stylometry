CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
WARNER BROS.

HA HA HA HA!

Helga: WHEN YOUR FATHER
WAS A BOY LIKE YOU

AND LIVING WITH ME
HERE IN NORWAY,

I TOLD HIM
ABOUT WITCHES, TOO,

SO THAT HE WOULD
ALWAYS BE AWARE.

NOW, THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING

YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
REAL WITCHES IS THIS--

NOW LISTEN
VERY CAREFULLY.

REAL WITCHES DRESS
IN ORDINARY CLOTHES

AND LOOK VERY MUCH
LIKE ORDINARY WOMEN.

THEY LIVE
IN ORDINARY HOUSES,

AND THEY WORK
IN ORDINARY JOBS.

EVERY COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD HAS WITCHES.

AND THERE IS A LEADER,

A HIGH WITCH,

OF EACH COUNTRY.

AND THE RULER
OF ALL THE WITCHES

IS THE MOST EVIL WOMAN
IN CREATION--

THE GRAND HIGH WITCH...

HERSELF.

WITCHES SPEND
THEIR TIME

PLOTTING
TO KILL CHILDREN,

STALKING
THE WRETCHED CHILD

LIKE A HUNTER STALKS
A BIRD IN THE FOREST.

DID THEY HUNT YOU?

YOU SAID
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

A VERY UNPLEASANT
ACCIDENT.

YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

I TRAVELED THE WORLD IN SEARCH
FOR THE GRAND HIGH WITCH,

BUT I NEVER FOUND HER.

I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE

THAT ANYONE
HAS EVER FOUND HER.

SO IF NO ONE'S SEEN
THE GRAND HIGH WITCH,

HOW ARE YOU SURE
SHE EXISTS?

NOBODY'S EVER SEEN
THE DEVIL,

BUT WE KNOW HE EXISTS,
DON'T WE?

YEAH.

FOR ALL YOU KNOW,

A WITCH MIGHT BE LIVING
NEXT DOOR TO YOU.

WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

I LIVED BESIDE A GIRL
CALLED ERICA,

WHO WAS TAKEN
BY A WITCH.

ERICA HAD VERY
STRICT PARENTS.

BUT EVEN THAT
DIDN'T SAVE POOR ERICA,

BECAUSE WHEN A WITCH
CHOOSES A VICTIM,

THERE IS ONLY
ONE HOPE OF ESCAPE--

KNOWING EVERYTHING
ABOUT THEM

THAT I AM TELLING YOU.

I'M WARNING YOU.

ERICA, COME IN.

WHAT MAKES HER
DANGEROUS

IS THE FACT THAT SHE
DOESN'T LOOK DANGEROUS.

YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE

IF IT'S A WITCH
YOU ARE LOOKING AT

OR A KIND LADY.


AH, ERICA.

HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY NEW PAINTING?

IT'SMAGNIFIQUE,
PAPA.

GO TO LARSEN'S

AND BUY...

A LITER OF MILK.
HMM?

JA,PAPA.

COME STRAIGHT HOME.

JA,DA.

REAL WITCHES
HATE CHILDREN.

REAL WITCHES
ARE QUITE BALD,

ALTHOUGH, OF COURSE,
THEY WEAR WIGS...

THAT ITCH...

AND CAUSE THEM
SCALP RASH.

DO YOU KNOW
WHAT SCALP RASH IS?

NO.

ITCHING UNDER THE WIG.

IT MUST DRIVE THEM CRAZY.

THEY LOOK QUITE HIDEOUS

BEHIND THEIR HUMAN
FACE MASKS

AND CAN ONLY BE DISTINGUISHED
FROM ORDINARY WOMEN

IF YOU ARE SHARP ENOUGH

TO SPOT THE PURPLE TINGE
TO THEIR EYES.

REAL WITCHES
HAVE NO TOES.

THEIR FEET
HAVE SQUARE ENDS,

REVOLTING STUMPS WHERE
THEIR TOES SHOULD BE,

SO THEY NEVER WEAR
POINTED OR PRETTY SHOES,

JUST PLAIN,
SENSIBLE SHOES.

REMEMBER THESE THINGS.

PERHAPS IF ERICA
HAD KNOWN THEM...



HA HA!

Helga: OH, MY POOR ERICA.

FOR WEEKS
THEY SEARCHED,

BUT WITCHES
DON'T MURDER CHILDREN

WITH KNIVES OR GUNS.

THAT'S FOR PEOPLE
WHO GET CAUGHT,

AND WITCHES
NEVER GET CAUGHT.

THEY SEARCHED
FOR MILES AROUND.

EVERYONE IN THE TOWN
SEARCHED,

BUT SHE HAD COMPLETELY
DISAPPEARED.

I WAS THERE IN ERICA'S HOUSE
SIX WEEKS LATER.

GOOD DAY,
FRAU LARSEN.

COME IN, HELGA.
HAVE SOME CAKE.

Helga: I WAS HER BEST FRIEND
WHEN IT ALL HAPPENED.

THEN THAT DAY,

WHILE ERICA'S MOTHER
WAS POURING THE COFFEE,

HER FATHER CAME
WALKING TOWARDS US.

IT WAS AS THOUGH
HE HAD SEEN A GHOST.

HIS FACE
WAS ALL TWISTED UP

AS HE WALKED TOWARDS
THE PAINTING BEHIND ME.

THERE, AS IF IT
ALWAYS HAD BEEN THERE,

WAS ERICA,

LOCKED
IN THE PAINTING,

GAZING AT US.

PAPA.

PAPA.

I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

YOU SAW HER IN THE
PAINTING, GRANDMA?

MANY TIMES.

BUT THE PECULIAR THING

WAS THAT LITTLE ERICA KEPT ON
CHANGING HER POSITION

IN THE PICTURE.

SO ONE DAY SHE'D BE
FEEDING THE DUCKS,

THE NEXT DAY SHE'D BE
INSIDE THE FARMHUSE,

LOOKING OUT OF A WINDOW.

DID YOU SEE HER
MOVING IN THE PICTURE?

NOBODY DID.

SHE WAS ALWAYS
JUST A FIGURE

MOTIONLESS
IN THE PAINTING.

AS THE YEARS WENT BY,

ERICA GREW OLDER,
TOO.

AND ONLY
FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO,

THE OLD WOMAN
THAT ERICA HAD BECOME,

BENT AND FRAIL
IN THE PAINTING,

BEGAN TO DISAPPEAR.

UNTIL ONE MORNING,

SHE WAS GONE.

YOU MEAN SHE DIED?

WHO KNOWS?

MYSTERIOUS THINGS GO ON
IN THE WORLD OF WITCHES.

HEY,
IT'S ALMOST 9:00.

GRANDMA'S
BEEN TELLING ME

ABOUT WITCHES,
MOM.

AND FRIGHTENING YOU
BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP.

GOOD NIGHT,
DARLING.

EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
MOTHER?

Helga:
VERY ALL RIGHT.

GO OFF. ENJOY
YOURSELVES.

GOODBYE,
MOM.

HERE YOU GO.

GOOD NIGHT, SON.

GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

NO MORE STORIES, OK?

OH, NO.

COME ON, GRANDMA.
JUST ONE MORE STORY.

ALL RIGHT, THEN.
ONE MORE.

BUT VERY SHORT.

WITCHES...

ARE VERY CRUEL.

AND THEY HAVE A HIGHLY-DEVELOPED
SENSE OF SMELL.

A REAL WITCH COULD SMELL YOU
ACROSS THE STREET

ON A PITCH-BLACK NIGHT.

SHE COULDN'T SMELL ME.
I JUST HAD A SHOWER.

OH, YES, SHE COULD.

THE CLEANER YOU ARE,

THE MORE A WITCH
CAN SMELL YOU.

THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

OH, YES, IT DOES.

A DIRTY CHILD,
IT'S THE DIRT SHE SMELLS.

A CLEAN CHILD,
IT IS THE CHILD.

WOW.

I'LL NEVER HAVE
A SHOWER AGAIN,

AND I'LL HAVE YOU
FOR AN EXCUSE.

WELL, JUST NOT TOO OFTEN.

ONLY ONCE A MONTH
IS PROBABLY SAFE.

SO A WITCH COULD
SMELL ME RIGHT NOW?

TO ME, YOU SMELL OF
RASPBERRIES AND CREAM,

BUT TO A WITCH,

YOU WOULD SMELL
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.

WHAT KIND
OF DISGUSTING?

LIKE DOGS' DROPPINGS.

I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT?

WHAT'S MORE,

TO A WITCH, YOU'D SMELL
OF FRESH DOGS' DROPPINGS.

THAT'S NOT TRUE.

THERE'S NO POINT
IN ARGUING.

IT'S A FACT OF LIFE.

SO IF YOU SEE A WOMAN
IN THE STREET

HOLDING HER NOSE
AS SHE PASSES YOU,

SHE COULD EASILY
BE A WITCH.

AND NOW IT IS
DEFINITELY BEDTIME.

GOOD NIGHT, GRANDMA.

MMM...

MMM!

[BLOWING A KISS]

MOM?

DAD?

FRAU EVERSHIM, COULD I
COME IN FOR A MINUTE?

I'M AFRAID
I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

JA,COME IN.

WAIT HERE.


COME ON.

COME HERE TO ME.

COME ON.

LET'S CUDDLE UP
HERE.

SIT ON MY LAP,
ALL RIGHT?

THERE.

[CHANGING STATIONS]

SHALL WE BRING THEM
TO ENGLAND?

YEAH.

JA,WE'LL DO THAT.

I THINK
THEY'RE VERY GOOD.

I REALLY DO.

QUITE A TALENT THERE

WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT.

THANKS.

Helga:
AFTER THE ACCIDENT,

I DIDN'T TAKE LUKE
BACK TO AMERICA RIGHT AWAY.

WE WENT TO ENGLAND
WHERE I HAD A HOUSE.

HE STARTED AT THE SCHOOL

HIS MOTHER AND FATHER
HAD CHOSEN FOR HIM...

BALD?

THAT'S WHY
THEY WEAR WIGS.

...BEFORE THEY CAME TO ME
ON THEIR VACATION.

THEY ITCH
AND SCRATCH A LOT.

I SAW A WOMAN YESTERDAY
WITH PURPLE EYES.

[BELL RINGS]


MMM.

UNH.

UNH.

HELLO, YOUNG MAN.

WHAT A MAGNIFICENT
TREE HOUSE.

DID YOU BUILD IT
YOURSELF?

MY DAD AND I DID.

I'VE GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU HERE...

SOMETHING I THINK
YOU'LL LIKE.

JUMP DOWN.

NO!

WHAT?

NO, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

IT'S WORTH
A LOT OF MONEY.

THIS IS
PRIVATE PROPERTY.

THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE FRIGHTENED OF.

I JUST WANTED
TO GIVE YOU THIS.


I FOUND HIM
ON MY WALK.

HE'S QUITE HARMLESS.

SEE?

LITTLE BOYS
LOVE SNAKES.

HERE, HE'S YOURS.

GRANDMA!

I'LL LEAVE HIM HERE
IF YOU LIKE.

YOU CAN COME DOWN
ON YOUR OWN

AND GET HIM. HMM?

THEY WRIGGLE AWAY
QUITE QUICKLY,

UNLESS YOU TELL THEM
NOT TO.

GRANDMA!

PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE
SOME CHOCOLATE INSTEAD?

GRANDMA!

SHE CAN'T HEAR YOU.

WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

IS IT...

LUKE?


THOUGHT SO.

HERE YOU ARE,
LUKE.

A BIG BAR
OF CHOCOLATE.

IF YOU C--

Helga: LUKE.

LUKE, IT'S DINNERTIME.

LUKE!

LUKE, DINNERTIME.


GRANDMA,
DID YOU SEE HER?

YES.

I THINK SHE WAS A WITCH.

GLOVES, PURPLE EYES.

SHE WANTED ME
TO CLIMB DOWN.

SHE HYPNOTIZED A SNAKE
SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME.

A REAL ONE?

A REAL SNAKE, YES!

I SWEAR.

YES, LUKE.
I BELIEVE YOU.

HA HA HA HA!


CLOSE YOUR EYES.
NO CHEATING.

TO YOUR CHAIR.
THERE WE ARE.

?? HAPPY BIRTHDA
Y TO YOU ??

?? HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TO YOU ??

?? HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
DEAR LUKE ??

?? HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TO YOU ??

THERE.

OH, GRANDMA!
THEY'RE GREAT!

I'LL BUILD THEM
A WHOLE CIRCUS,

TEACH THEM TRICKS

AND ACROBATICS
AND STUFF.

IT MUST BE SO NEAT
BEING A MOUSE.

JUST PLAY ALL DAY

AND EAT, AND THEN
PLAY SOME MORE.

I'M GOING TO RIG UP
A WHOLE ROOM

WITH RAMPS AND--

OH!

GRANDMA!

GRANDMA!

GRANDMA!

YOUR GRANNY HAS A VERY
MILD CASE OF DIABETES.

IT'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

REST NOW.

IN A COUPLE DAYS,
YOU'LL BE RIGHT AS RAIN.

YOU'LL BE BETTER.

GOOD.

I'M PUTTING YOU
ON A SUGAR-FREE DIET.

NO CAKES, CANDIES,
OR SUGAR AT ALL.

THOSE CIGARS WON'T
DO YOU ANY GOOD.

SEE?

THERE ARE MORE PILLS
TO TAKE.

WITH THAT AND A GOOD
HOLIDAY BY THE SEASIDE,

YOU'LL BE GOOD AS NEW.

COME ON, YOUNG MAN,
LEAVE YOUR GRANNY TO REST.

PERHAPS YOU'LL BRING HER
BREAKFAST IN BED IN THE MORNING.

BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON,
YOU CAN BOSS HER AROUND

LIKE BEFORE.

BYE-BYE,
MRS. EVERSHIM.

BYE-BYE.

SEE YOU
IN A FEW DAYS.

CAN YOU FIND
YOUR WAY?

YES.

HOW COME DOCTORS
SPEAK TO EVERYBODY

LIKE THEY'RE BABIES?

I KNOW.

I'M SORRY FOR SPOILING
YOUR BIRTHDAY FOR YOU

AND FOR GIVING YOU
A FRIGHT.

IS IT ALL RIGHT

IF I PLAY WITH
WILLIAM AND MARY NOW?

YES, OF COURSE.

[SQUEAK SQUEAK]

LISTEN, MARY MOUSE,

WHEN GRANDMA GETS BETTER,
WE'RE GOING WITH HER

TO A HOTEL BY THE OCEAN.

YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
TO THE OCEAN. IT'S BIG.

HA HA HA HA!

WOW! LOOK AT
THE HOTEL, GRANDMA.

IT'S NOT HALF BAD.

WELCOME, MADAM.

THANK YOU.
NICE DAY, YES?

LOVELY.

CAN YOU MANAGE,
LUKE?

YEAH.

YES.

LUKE...

COME ON.
THERE WE GO.

OH, WELCOME,
MISS ERNST.

NICOLA COLE.

I'VE BEEN SO
LOOKING FORWARD

TO MEETING YOU.

YOU LOOK
MARVELOUS.

WISH I COULD SAY
THE SAME FOR YOU.

AH, MISS ERNST.

I AM THE OWNER
OF THE HOTEL.

WE'RE VERY HAPPY
TO HAVE YOU.

DELIGHTED. SHALL I SIGN
OR SOMETHING?

NO. EVERYTHING
WILL BE FINE.

THIS IS MY SECRETARY.

OH, YES.
HOW ARE YOU?

AH, LADIES.

INA CLAY
BECKMAN.

INDEED.

JULIA WHITMAN.

JULIA, YES.
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

DALLINGER.

AH, YES.

LOIS LEFFOUR
FROM SOUTHAMPTON.

LOIS.

OOH!

IN THERE, I THINK.

THAT'S WHERE
YOU MUST LIVE.

OH, UM, THE CARPETBAG
ON THE BED, PLEASE.

I'LL HAVE
A WASH AND BRUSH-UP

WHILE YOU EXPLORE
THE PLACE, LUKE.

THEN WE SHALL
HAVE TEA TOGETHER,

AND YOU'LL SHOW ME
AROUND, YES?

THANK YOU.

ON'T
LOCK ME OUT.

I PROMISE I WON'T.

HMPH.

YOU LOOK WONDERFUL,
MISS ERNST.

WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS AFTERNOON.

HMM.

ALLEZ.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

OH! THE RAISINS
ARE ALL AROUND

THE EDGE OF THESE CAKES.

THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.

THANKS.

MY NAME'S LUKE.

BRUNO JENKINS.

THE CUCUMBER SANDWICHES
ARE ALL RIGHT, TOO--

EXCEPT WHEN THEY USE
MARGARINE INSTEAD OF BUTTER.

HOW MUCH POCKET MONEY
DO YOU GET?

MY DAD'S RICH,
BUT HE'S VERY TIGHT.

WE'VE GOT THREE CARS.

HELLO, BOYS.

I HOPE THERE'S BUTTER
IN THE SANDWICHES TODAY.

I REALLY DO
HATE MARGARINE.

AH, YOU'VE GOT THOSE
EXCELLENT CAKES AGAIN.

THERE SHOULD BE
14 OF--

AAH! AAH!

MR. STRINGER!

OH! OH!

SHH, SHH.
WHAT HAPPENED?

I WENT IN TO
TURN DOWN THE BED,

AND THEY WERE THERE.

WHAT?

WHITE AND DISGUSTING
LITTLE--

NOW, LOOK. CALM DOWN.


[KNOCK ON DOOR]

IS THIS YOUR ROOM?

YES.

YES?

I SEE.
I'M SORRY, MADAM,

BUT I CANNOT PERMIT
MICE IN MY HOTEL.

HOW DARE YOU
SAY THAT

WHEN YOUR ROTTEN HOTEL
IS FULL OF RATS ANYWAY?

RATS? THERE ARE NO
RATS IN THIS HOTEL.

I SAW ONE THIS MORNING
RUN INTO THE KITCHENS.

MADAM, YOU ONLY ARRIVED IN
THE HOTEL THIS AFTERNOON.

AHH, MORNING, AFTERNOON.

I SAW A RAT
IN YOUR HOTEL,

AND IF MATTERS
DO NOT IMPROVE,

I'LL HAVE TO
REPORT YOU

TO THE PUBLIC
HEALTH AUTHORITIES.

LOOK...

MADAM,
I'M NOT PREPARED--

THE CAKES
IN THE LOUNGE

ARE NIBBLED
AROUND THE EDGES, TOO.

Helga:
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,

THE HEALTH PEOPLE WILL
ORDER THE HOTEL CLOSED

BEFORE EVERYONE
GETS TYPHOID FEVER.

YOU CAN'T
BE SERIOUS.

I HAVE NEVER
BEEN MORE SERIOUS

IN MY LIFE.

NOW, WILL YOU OR WILL YOU
NOT LET MY GRANDCHILD

KEEP HIS HYGIENIC AND
PERFECTLY HARMLESS PET MICE?

UH...WELL...

00:24:32,91 --> 00:24:35,974
WELL, IF THEY ARE
KEPT IN THE CAGE,

ONLY IN THIS ROOM,

NOWHERE ELSE
IN THE HOTEL...

AGREED.

VERY WELL.

GRANDMA, I CAN'T
TRAIN MY MICE

IF THEY'RE
IN A CAGE.

NIBBLED CAKES, INDEED.

THERE WERE, ONLY IT WAS A BOY
CALLED BRUNO JENKINS.

I'M TEACHING
WILLIAM AND MARY

HOW TO BE
TIGHTROPE WALKERS.

MM-HMM.

I BROUGHT SOME
OF THE CIRCUS I'M BUILDING.

GOOD. SHOW ME.

LET'S SEE.

LOOK. I'M PLANNING
THEM A MAJOR HOUSE.

RAMPWAYS HERE.
A BATHTUB.

THIS ELEVATOR'S
PRETTY NEAT.

YOU REALLY DID THIS
YOURSELF? IT'S GOOD.

IT'S REALLY GOOD.
I'M IMPRESSED.

OF COURSE YOU MUST
TRAIN YOUR MICE,

BUT YOU MUSTN'T GET
CAUGHT OR DO IT IN HERE.

IF THAT HYSTERICAL MAID
COMES BACK...

WELL, NOW
IT'S TEATIME.

I JUST LOVE
ENGLISH HOTEL TEAS.

CREAM CAKES
AND SHORTBREAD

AND, UH--

NO, GRANDMA.

NO CREAM
CAKES.

NO SHORTBREAD,
EITHER.

IT'S FULL OF SUGAR.

I SHALL END UP EATING
YOUR MICE'S DIET.

THAT'S THE TROUBLE
WITH THIS COUNTRY.

A QUEUE FOR EVERYTHING.

THEY WOULDN'T THINK TO
HAVE TWO TEA TROLLEYS.

THAT'D BE TOO CONVENIENT
FOR THE PAYING GUESTS.

THEY'LL WANT
TWO LUMPS OF ICE

IN THEIR WHISKEY
NEXT.

THEY'D QUEUE FOR THEIR OWN
FUNERALS IF THEY COULD.

I KNOW THAT WOMAN
FROM SOMEWHERE,

BUT I CAN'T FOR THE LIFE
OF ME REMEMBER WHERE.

HER FACE
IS SO FAMILIAR.

WHICH ONE?

MY MEMORY'S GOING,

BUT IT'S AS IF
I MET HER BEFORE.

SHE'S PROBABLY
ON TV OR SOMETHING.

MMM. CUCUMBER
SANDWICHES.

MMM--

FISH PASTE.

Luke:
YOU GOT THE WRONG ONE.

OH, NO. SUGAR.

GRANDMA,
SUGAR CAN KILL YOU.

I KNOW, BUT
IT WAS VERY LITTLE,

VERY LITTLE,
MY DEAR.

SOMETHING VERY ODD
IS GOING ON.

ARE YOU LISTENING?
YOU'LL HAVE SOME FRESH AIR

IF I HAVE TO TAKE YOU
OUT BY YOUR EAR.

YOU'RE NOT HERE TO EAT
AND WATCH TELLY.

OTHER BOYS ARE OUT
PLAYING IN THE WATER.

PICK UP YOUR KNIFE.

00:27:01,53 --> 00:27:03,955
JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER.

GOOD AFTERNOON,
MADAM.

GO ON.

YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE
ALL RIGHT NOW?

YES, YES.
FINE, FINE.

AND WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW?

TAKE WILLIAM AND MARY
AND EXPLORE THIS PLACE.

ALL RIGHT. JUST DON'T GET
INTO TROUBLE, WILL YOU?

I WON'T.

COME ON.

EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.

ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S FINE.

CARRY ON WITH
THE REST OF THEM.

NO, IN THE KITCHEN.
IN THE KITCHEN.

WAIT THERE.

OHH...

[SQUEAK SQUEAK
SQUEAK SQUEAK]

GREAT.
NOW DO IT AGAIN.

[SQUEAK SQUEAK SQUEAK]

COME ON, COME ON.

I'M SURE YOUR DELEGATES
WILL BE COMFORTABLE IN HERE.

IF WE CAN DO
ANYTHING,

OBVIOUSLY, PLEASE
DON'T HESITATE TO--

NICOLA,
DOWN IN FRONT!

TO LET ME KNOW.

NOW, DRINKS WILL BE SERVED
ON THE TERRACE AFTER--

FINE, FINE.

YOU'VE CONCLUDED
YOUR MEETING.

UM, SKIES ARE CLEARING--

COME ON, LADIES.
SIT.

SIT DOWN.

AND WE'VE PREPARED
A FINE MEAL FOR YOU TONIGHT.

THE CHEF'S SPECIAL SOUP...

HEY, LOOK AT HER EYES.

THEN LAMB AND
FRESH RASPBERRIES.

I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT.

FINE. THANK YOU.

EVERYBODY SITTING?

UP FRONT, SIT DOWN!

NOT...YET!

WE GOT TO GET
OUT OF HERE.

COME ALONG, LADIES.

WHEN YOU'RE READY,
WE CAN START.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR LETTING ME STAY.

THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
ELSIE.

I'LL LOCK UP.

OH. RIGHT. OK.

Ernst: THEN WE'LL BEGIN.

YOU MAY REMOVE
YOUR SHOES.

YOU MAY REMOVE
YOUR WIGS.

THE DOORS. ARE THEY
LOCKED AND BOLTED?

LOCKED AND BOLTED,
YOUR GRANDNESS.

GOOD.

HELP ME.

NO, NO!

Wow.

WITCHES OF ENGLAND...

YOU'RE A DISGRACE!

MISERABLE WITCHES.

YOU'RE GOOD-FOR-NOTHING
WORMS!

EVERYWHERE I LOOK...

I SEE
THE REPULSIVE SIGHT

OF HUNDREDS...

THOUSANDS...

OF REVOLTING
LITTLECHILDREN.

I ASK YOU...

WHY?

ONE CHILD A WEEK
IS NO GOOD TO ME.

WE WILL DO BETTER.

WE WILL DO
MUCH BETTER.

HUH. BETTER
IS NO GOOD EITHER!

I DEMAND

MAXIMUM RESULTS.

SO...

HERE ARE MY ORDERS.

MY ORDERS ARE

THAT EVERY CHILD
IN ENGLAND

SHALL BE RUBBED OUT.

DESTROYED!

EVERY SINGLE CHILD
ELIMINATED!

OH!

DO I MAKE MYSELF
CLEAR?

Yes.
Yes.

[COUGH COUGH]

WE CAN'T POSSIBLY
WIPE OUT ALL OF THEM.

WHO SPOKE?

WHO DARES
TO ARGUE WITH ME?

IT WAS YOU?

I DIDN'T MEAN TO ARGUE,
YOUR GRANDNESS.

YOU DARE TO ARGUE
WITH ME?

NO. NO, HONESTLY.
IT JUST WAS A--

A STUPID WITCH
WHO ANSWERS BACK

MUST BURN UNTIL
HER BONES ARE BLACK!

NO! NO!

A FOOLISH WITCH
WITHOUT A BRAIN...

MUST SIZZLE
INTO FIERY FLAME!

A WITCH WHO DARES
TO SAY I'M WRONG...

WILL NOT BE WITH US
VERY LONG!

AAH!

WHAT THE DEVIL?

I HOPE NOBODY ELSE

IS GOING TO MAKE ME
CROSS TODAY.

NO.
NO.

SO...

NOW, THIS
IS MY PLAN.

EACH OF YOU

WILL GO BACK
TO YOUR HOMES

AND RESIGN
FROM YOUR JOBS.

GIVE NOTICE.

RETIRE.

Retire?

YOU WILL THEN BUY

WITH THE MONEY
I GIVE YOU

SWEET SHOPS.

CANDY STORES.

THE VERY BEST

AND MOST RESPECTABLE
SWEET SHOPS IN ENGLAND.

HA HA HA HA!

AH!
OH!

UPSTAIRS I HAVE A TRUNKLOAD
OF THIS ENGLISH MONEY,

SO YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO OFFER

THREE, MAYBE FOUR TIMES
WHAT THESE SHOPS ARE WORTH.

GO, GO.

ON A CERTAIN DAY,

WHEN ALL OUR PLANS
ARE PREPARED,

YOU'LL ANNOUNCE
A GREAT GALA OPENING

WITH FREE SWEETS,
CANDIES, AND CHOCOLATES

FOR EVERY CHILD.

POISONED SWEETS.

WE'LL WIPE THEM OUT
LIKE WEASELS.

WHO SPOKE?

SHE DID!

IT'S BRILLIANT.

POISON?

AND YOU DON'T MIND
GETTING CAUGHT?

EXPOSED?

VILIFIED?

WELL,
I JUST THOUGHT--

BRAINLESS BUMPKIN!

YOU BLITHERING
BOGVUMPER!

NO WONDER ENGLAND
IS SWARMING WITH--


EVERYTHING YOU SELL
THAT DAY

WILL HAVE BEEN TREATED

WITH MY VERY LATEST

AND VERY GREATEST
MAGIC FORMULA.

?? WITCHES WORK ONLY
WITH MAGIC ??

[SQUEAK SQUEAK]

Hey, wait. Come here.

William. Mary.

FORMULA 86.

MY GREATEST TRIUMPH.

A WORK OF...

GENIUS.

FORMULA 86!

IN THIS BOTTLE,

500 DOSES

WITH A DELAY MECHANISM

THAT PREVENTS IT FROM
WORKING UNTIL TWO HOURS

AFTER IT HAS BEEN TAKEN.

HA HA HA HA.

WHAT DOES IT DO...

GENIUS ONE?

YES?
YES?

YES?
WHAT?

ONE DOSE, AND THE TIME
WORKS TO THE SECOND.

BUT MORE
THAN FIVE DOSES

BREAKS
THE DELAY BARRIER,

AND THE FORMULA
WORKS INSTANTLY.

THE CHILD...

STARTS TO SHRINK.

SHRINK?
SHRINK?

HA HA HA
HA HA HA.

THE CHILD...

STARTS TO...

GROW FUR.

FUR?
FUR?

STARTS...

GROWING A TAIL.

A TAIL?

A TAIL?

ALL THIS HAPPENS IN
PRECISELY 25 SECONDS!

SHRINKING MORE.

THE CHILD IS NO LONGER
A CHILD.

HEH HEH HEH
HEH HEH HEH.

THE CHILD...

IS A MOUSE!

HA HA HA HA!

SILENCE. SILENCE.

SHUT UP. SHUT UP.

SILENCE.

ENOUGH.

THIS AFTERNOON,

AT PRECISELY 4:15,

I PUT ONE DOSE
OF MY FORMULA

ON A BAR
OF CHOCOLATE.

I GAVE IT TO
A REPULSIVE, SMELLY BOY

WHO WAS IN THE LOBBY.

"WAS THAT GOOD?"
I ASKED HIM.

"GOT ANY MORE?"

SAID THE NAUSEATING CHILD.

"SIX MORE BARS
LIKE THAT ONE,"

I TOLD HIM.

IN TWO MINUTES' TIME,

THIS APPALLING,
FOUL-SMELLING CREATURE

IS COMING TO COLLECT
HIS REWARD.

IN FIVE MINUTES' TIME,

YOU'LL SEE MY MAGIC
FORMULA IN ACTION.

WE'RE GOING TO SEE.

QUICKLY!

WIGS! GLOVES!

THE APPALLING CHILD
WILL BE HERE...

AND YOU'LL SEE
MY MIRACLE.

COME ON. HURRY UP!

HURRY UP!

COME ON. THAT'S GOOD.

HURRY UP, EVERYBODY.

COME ON!

QUICKLY! QUICKLY!

YOU'RE NOT ON HOLIDAY!

I'M BEING AS QUICK
AS I CAN.

HURRY UP!

READY.

HELLO, LITTLE BOY.

COME ON IN THEN.

COME ON.
WAIT JUST THERE.

ONE MOMENT.

NOW, WHAT'S
YOUR NAME THEN?

BR--BRUNO.

OOH.

MADAM.

MADAM!

THAT LADY PROMISED ME
SIX WHOLE BARS

OF CREAM-WHIP HAZELNUT
MILK CHOCOLATE.

I'VE COME
TO COLLECT.

LADIES.

MAY I INTRODUCE BRUNO?

COME UP, BRUNO.

I HAVE
THE CHOCOLATE HERE.

I SAID 6:15...

AND THAT IS IN
15 SECONDS FROM NOW.

YOU ARE IN FOR A TREAT.

HA HA HA!
WE ALL ARE!

WHAT'S GOING ON?

JUST A FEW MOMENTS.

5...

I CAN'T SEE
ANY CHOCOLATES.

3...

2...

1...

0!

OOH!

UHH!


WE HAVE IGNITION!

EVERYBODY, LOOK!
IT'S FANTASTIC!

IT'S BEGUN!

I CAN'T STAND IT,
IT'S SO WONDERFUL!

LOOK AT YOU!
IT'S FANTASTIC!

SQUEAK SQUEAK.

SQUEAK SQUEAK.

[SQUEAK SQUEAK]


WHERE'D HE GO?

BRAVO!

KEYS.

KEYS!

ENOUGH!

SILENCE!

BEFORE THE BANQUET
TONIGHT,

YOU'LL COME TO MY ROOM
IN GROUPS OF 10.

ROOM NUMBER 208.

I'LL GIVE YOU EACH A BOTTLE
CONTAINING 500 DOSES.

ALSO PLENTY OF MONEY.

DO NOT FORGET YOUR
NOSE PLUGS FOR THE DINNER.

THE DINING ROOM WILL
BE FULL OF FILTHY CHILDREN,

AND WITHOUT
YOUR NOSE PLUGS,

THE STINK WILL BE
UNBEARABLE.

NOW WE'LL HAVE DRINKS
ON THE TERRACE

WITH THAT RIDICULOUS
MANAGER.

ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?

WHAT IF ONE OF THE
CHOCOLATES WE GIVE AWAY

WERE ACCIDENTALLY
EATEN BY A GROWNUP?

HA HA.

THEN THAT'S JUST TOO BAD
FOR THE GROWNUP.

THE MEETING IS OVER.

UNTIL NEXT YEAR.

WAIT!

WAIT!

WAIT!

[SNIFF SNIFF]

I SMELL...

DOGS' DROPPINGS.

OH!

WHAT?

SHE'S RIGHT.

OH! THE SMELL!

OOH! YUCK!

THIS REALLY DOES
SMELL.

SHE'S RIGHT!

SEARCH OUT THIS SMALL
LUMP OF DUNG!

FIND IT!

IT MUST BE EXTERMINATED
IMMEDIATELY.

THERE HE IS!

HE'S WIGGLING THROUGH.

HE'S GETTING AWAY.

COME HERE, BOY.

BRING HIM TO ME!

AAH!

THERE HE IS!

STOP HIM!


I SAW HIM COME
THIS WAY.

YES.
WHERE COULD HE BE?

BYE-BYE.

HA HA HA HA!

AAH! OH, NO!

NO! MY BABY!

STOP! STOP!

OH! MY BABY!

A BABY IN A PRAM.

OH, OH.


LOVELY!

OH, NO.

GET THE BOY.

HE'S GETTING AWAY.

GRANDMA!

GRANDMA, WAKE UP!

OH, PLEASE, GRANDMA!

MY GRANDMA!

AN OLD ADVERSARY
I HAVE DISCOVERED.

VERY OLD.

IF YOU HURT
MY GRANDMA--

SILENCE!

WE GOT HIM,
MADAM.

WE GOT HIM,
MADAM. OH!

DON'T BITE.

OPEN UP.

500 DOSES.

COME ALONG.

COME ALONG.

COME ON.

GET UP. GET UP.

COME ON. COME ON.

LOOK.

THIS STINKING
LITTLE CARBUNCLE

HAS HAD 500 DOSES.

WE ARE HAVING
INSTANTANEOUS ACTION.

OHH...

BYE.


KILL HIM.

KILL HIM!

KILL HIM!


HA HA HA HA...

LEAVE THAT LITTLE STINKPOT!

IT'S NOT WORTH
BOTHERING ABOUT.

COME. SOME WHISKEY
AND CHAMPAGNE TO CELEBRATE.

BRUNO?

I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

I CAN TALK.

BRUNO?

Bruno: WHO'S THAT?

BRUNO, IT'S ME.
LUKE.

I'M DOWN HERE.

WHERE?
I CAN'T SEE YOU.

DOWN HERE.

YOU CAN TALK, TOO.

THIS IS WEIRD.

THIS ICING
IS TERRIFIC.

ARE YOU OK?

THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME THE
SIX BARS OF CHOCOLATE.

YOU COULDN'T EAT SIX BARS
NOW THAT YOU'RE A MOUSE.

DON'T BE STUPID.
I'M NOT A...

JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE A...

THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I'M A, UH...

GOOD LORD.

HMM. HMM.

I'M NOT TOO KEEN
ON BEING A MOUSE.

WE'VE GOT TO FIND
A WAY OUT.

HOW LONG BEFORE
WE CHANGE BACK?

I DON'T THINK
WE WILL.

OF COURSE WE WILL.

WE'VE GOT TO GET UPSTAIRS
AND WAKE MY GRANDMA.

I'M REAL WORRIED
ABOUT HER.

MAYBE IT WAS THE WITCH
OR HER DIABETES.

I ONLY KNOW SHE DIDN'T
WAKE UP WHEN I--

SHE'S GOT
SOME PEANUTS, TOO.

MMM. DRY ROASTED?

MM-HMM.

OH. ALL RIGHT.

COME ON.

WILLIAM AND MARY!

HI. IT'S ME, LUKE.

ARE YOU TWO ALL RIGHT?

CRIKEY! DID THEY EAT
THE CHOCOLATES AS WELL?

THEY WERE
MY PET MICE.

I GUESS THEY CAN'T TALK
LIKE WE CAN.

CATCH YOU TWO LATER.

HMM.

COME ON, BRUNO.

THIS WAY.

OHH.

LUKE?

LUKE?

HMM.

THEY'RE GONE.

IT'S ALL CLEAR,
BRUNO.

COME ON.

UNH...UNH.

WAIT FOR ME.

UNH...UNH...UNH.

RUNNING...

RUNNING ON A FULL STOMACH
ISN'T GOOD FOR YOU.

BETTER THAN
BEING CAUGHT.

KEEP UP, BRUNO.

SPORTS GIVE ME
INDIGESTION.

UNH.

GET BACK.

OK, BRUNO,
WHEN I SAY GO, GO!

GO!

RUN!

WAIT.

FOLLOW ME.

AAH!

AGH!

HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET UPSTAIRS?

I'M SORRY.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M PAYING FOR.

DAD?

HEY,
THERE'S MY DAD!

HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENED.

HE'LL KILL YOU.

MY OWN FATHER?

WHOEVER TOOK THE PHOTOS
IN THAT BROCHURE

SHOULD BE ARRESTED
FOR FRAUD.

I'LL TELL HIM.

HE'LL PUT
A STOP TO IT.

NOT NOW.

TRUST ME, BRUNO,
PLEASE.

HE'LL STAMP ON YOU
THE MOMENT HE SEES YOU.

IT'S SO NICE NOT HAVING
THE KIDS AROUND.

Bruno: I SMELL FOOD.

IS THERE ANYTHING
IN THIS BAG?

THEY'LL BE FINE.

I THINK JOHN
WAS GETTING A COLD.

IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME.

YOU MUST RELAX
ONCE IN A WHILE.

[ELEVATOR BELL
RINGS]

THIS IS IT.
LET'S GO.

OH, NO MORE SPORTS.

HURRY!

FASTER. FASTER!

OOH!

OUCH!

I FORGOT MY TAIL.

OOH. OHH.

KEEP TO THE SIDE,
BRUNO.

YOU KNOW,

BEING LIKE THIS
MIGHT NOT BE SO BAD.

THERE WON'T BE
ANY MORE SCHOOL.

THAT WOULD BE
ALL RIGHT.

HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

DON'T EAT
THE CHEESE, BRUNO.

FROM NOW ON
WE'VE GOT TWO ENEMIES--

HUMANS AND CATS.

YIKES! WE'VE GOT
THREE CATS AT HOME.

THEY'LL HAVE TO GO.

MY MOTHER LOVES THEM.

SHE'S TERRIFIED OF MICE.

GRANDMA!

GRANDMA!

[DOOR OPENS]

TAKE YOUR AFTERNOON
OFF TOMORROW.

OH. SORRY.

LET'S GO.

WHAT? HEY, WAIT!

THERE ARE FOUR MORE
FLOORS TO BE DONE.

NO, I'LL GET THIS ONE.

SHH. BACK.

AAH! AAH!

WHAT BIT YOU?

A MOUSE
IN THE TOWEL.

A MOUSE?

A MOUSE?

OH, NO.

IS SHE SOBER?

OF COURSE.

I'VE BEEN WITH HER

UH, I--I--I, UH...

YES, SHE'S SOBER.

DON'T BE STUPID.

GO AND DO
THE SECOND FLOOR.

GRANDMA!

GRANDMA!

LUKE?

IT'S ME, GRANDMA.

LUKE!

IT WAS THE GRAND
HIGH WITCH.

SHE'S IN THIS HOTEL!

OH, MY GOD!

DON'T CRY, GRANDMA.

IT'S OK.

THINGS COULD
HAVE BEEN WORSE.

I GOT AWAY
FROM THEM.

I'M STILL ALIVE.

OH, MY DARLING LUKE.

WHAT HAVE THEY
DONE TO YOU?

THEY TURNED ME
INTO A MOUSE.

I'M SORRY.

I CAN'T STOP SHAKING.

THE GRAND
HIGH WITCH--HERE?

THERE'S HUNDREDS OF
THEM IN THIS HOTEL.

I KNEW IT.

I COULD SEE IT
IN HER EYES.

OH, LORD.

UHH. UHH.

YOU SQUASHED ME.

HUH?

THIS IS
BRUNO JENKINS.

HE SAID YOU'VE GOT
DRY ROAST PEANUTS.

YES. OH, YES.

OH, GOOD. THANKS.

WE'VE GOT TO STOP THEM,
GRANDMA.

THEY LEAVE TOMORROW
WITH A BUNDLE OF MONEY

AND A FORMULA

THAT WILL CHANGE
EVERY KID IN ENGLAND

INTO A MOUSE.

WE MUST STOP THEM.

MISS ERNST.

LOIS.

NICE TO SEE A BIT OF
INTERNATIONAL CLIENTELE.

HOW DO YOU DO?

JUST FLEW IN?

WHAT?

JET LAG'S THE CURSE
OF THE BUSINESS CLASSES.

HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
ME JOINING YOU.

YOU'RE MOST WELCOME, SIR.

HERBERT JENKINS.

I'D LIKE
TO SAY HELLO

TO A FELLOW
PHILANTHROPIST.

YOU COLLECT STAMPS?

CHARITIES.

Cruelty to children.

OH, OF COURSE.

FOR THE LITTLE...

[MONEY DROPPING
IN BOWL]

I SEE YOU'RE HOLDING
YOUR ANNUAL MEETING.

FUNNY ENOUGH,

I RECENTLY ADDRESSED
THE LAST ANNUAL MEETING

OF OUR ROTARY CLUB.

DO YOU KNOW MUCH
ABOUT THE ROTARY CLUB?

Luke: IF I COULD GET THE FORMULA
INTO THEIR FOOD...

JUST GET ME DOWN TO
THE GRAND HIGH WITCH'S ROOM.

GRANDMA, I'M READY.

I DON'T KNOW.

I'VE GOT TO FIND
THE FORMULA, GRANDMA.

NO. THIS IS
TOO DANGEROUS.

GRANDMA!

IT'S NOT FAR DOWN,
GRANDMA.

YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO LOWER YOU

INTO THE JAWS OF DEATH.

YOU TWO CAN'T TAKE ON
THE GRAND HIGH WITCH.

YES, WE CAN.
WE'VE GOT TO.

NO ONE ELSE IS
GOING TO BELIEVE US.

QUICK, BEFORE
SHE COMES BACK.

LUKE...

LUKE, BE CAREFUL.

PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

I'LL BE CAREFUL.

DON'T WORRY.

NOT SO FAST.

BE CAREFUL.

I WILL. I WILL.

OH, NO.

IT HAS BEEN UNFORGETTABLE,
MR. JENKINS.

MY PLEASURE, MADAM.

CONVERSATION IT HAS BEEN.

IT'S NOT EVERY DAY

OF SUCH QUALITY
AND...AND COMPASSION.

WHOA!

[CAT SCREECHES]

Irvine: DID YOU REALIZE
THAT WAS BRUNO'S FATHER?

Ernst: WHAT A NASTY MAN.

ON MY PART.

THE CHILD WILL NEVER

YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
BY ANY CHANCE?

NO, NO.

COME,LIEBCHEN.

I'M DREADFULLY SORRY.

I DO APOLOGIZE.

THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

IF I SEE YOUR GRANDSON,
I WILL...

I WILL TURN HIM
INTO A MOUSE.

AND YOU,
MEDDLING OLD WOMAN,

I'LL DEAL WITH LATER.

LIEBCHEN.

I HOPE WE'RE NOT
THE FIRST.

MISS ERNST!

WHO IS THIS?

YOU TOLD THEM TO COME UP
AFTER THE DRINKS.

ALL RIGHT.
LET THEM IN.

COME IN.

YOU WERE WNDERFUL
THIS AFTERNOON.

YOU BAD CAT,LIEBCHEN.

YOU'RE EARLY,
IN FACT.


Man: WHEN DO YOU THINK
THEY'D IMPLEMENT IT?

Second man: FIRST OF
THE YEAR, I SUPPOSE.

SHE'S A VERY PLEASANT
WOMAN.

YES. NOW,
THE QUESTION IS,

WOULD SHE LIKE
TO WORK WITH US?

Luke: OW! OH...

WHEW!

GRANDMA, GRANDMA!
I'VE GOT IT!

I'VE GOT THE FORMULA.

OH, THANK GOD.

LUKE, DARLING,
I WAS SO WORRIED.

THERE'S 500 DOSES
IN THIS ONE LITTLE BOTTLE.

IT'S ENOUGH TO CHANGE
ALL THE WITCHES

IN THIS HOTEL.

WHERE'S BRUNO?

THERE'S SOME JOLLY GOOD
GRAPES HERE.

WHAT'S HAPPENING?

NOTHING UNTIL DINNERTIME.

NOW, WE'VE GOT TO GET YOU
BACK TO YOUR PARENTS.

WHAT TIME IS IT?

7:00.

THEY'LL BE IN THE BAR.

A SHERRY AND A LARGE
MALT WHISKEY AT 7:00 SHARP.

IT GIVES YOU
AN APPETITE.

DOES IT?

COME ON.

INTO MY HANDBAG,
BOTH OF YOU.

THIS IS GOING
TO BE DIFFICULT.

OH, I'M FULL.

Luke: WE'VE GOT TO GET
TO THE KITCHEN QUICKLY.

Bruno: HA HA HA.
THAT TICKLES.

IS THAT THEM?

Luke: YES.
LISTEN, GRANDMA.

MAYBE WE
OUGHT TO--

SHH.

WAIT! LISTEN...

DON'T DROWN IT.

OH, SORRY.

NOW LOOK WHAT
YOU'VE DONE!

SHE WAS DROWNING IT.

ARE YOU MR.
AND MRS. JENKINS?

HOLE IN ONE.
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR YOU?

I'D LIKE TO HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU

ABOUT YOUR SON.

SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

NOW, WHAT'S THE LITTLE
TYKE BEEN UP TO NOW?

RAIDING THE KITCHEN,
I SUPPOSE.

IF WE COULD GO SOMEWHERE
MORE PRIVATE...

PRIVATE?

WELL, IT IS
RATHER A...

PERSONAL MATTER.

LOOK, MRS. WHATEVER
YOUR NAME IS,

IF BRUNO HAS BROKEN A WINDOW
OR SMASHED YOUR SPECTACLES,

I'LL PAY FOR IT,
BUT WE'RE NOT BUDGING.

WE ALWAYS SIT
AT THIS TABLE.

WHERE IS BRUNO?
TELL HIM TO COME SEE ME.

HE IS HERE ALREADY.

WHAT?

IN MY HANDBAG.

YOUR SON HAS
SUFFERED A MISHAP.

HE HAS BEEN
DRASTICALLY ALTERED.

ALTERED? WHAT DO
YOU MEAN, ALTERED?

I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU
AS GENTLY AS POSSIBLE.

MY GRANDSON SAW THEM
DOING IT TO HIM.

SAW WHO DOING WHAT?

SAW THE WITCHES TURN
HIM INTO A MOUSE.

ARE YOU CRACKERS?

GET THE MANAGER, DEAR.

TELL THEM TO THROW THIS
NUTCASE OUT OF THE HOTEL.

YOU NEED A FUNNY FARM.

TELL THEM, BRUNO.

AAH! IT'S A MOUSE!

SHH!

I CAN'T STAND THEM!
GET THEM AWAY!

IT IS BRUNO.
TELL THEM, BRUNO.

GET OUT OF HERE!
HOW DARE YOU!

COME ON.
TELL THEM, BRUNO.

AAH!

IT'S ME, MUM. I--

THE POLICE,

JUST GO ON! PUSH OFF!

NEVER COME BACK,

I DID MY BEST,
BRUNO.

DON'T WORRY, DEAR.
JUST GO ON.

EVENING, MADAM.

JUST POPPING IN TO
TURN DOWN YOUR BED.

HOW IS
THE ROOM SERVICE HERE?

DIABOLICAL.

HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT WOMAN UPSTAIRS?

WALK DOWNSTAIRS.
THE ELEVATOR IS OUT OF ORDER.

MUST BE.

IT'S A FIVE-COURSE MEAL.

GOOD.
I'M RATHER HUNGRY.

MMM.

OH...

I'D LIKE TO GO HOME,
THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE.

WHAT ARE YOU

NO! YOU MUST GO TO YOUR ROOM
AND PREPARE FOR--

HELLO!

FOR TOMORROW'S FLIGHT.
YES, HAVE A GOOD FLIGHT.

BUT IT'S
OUR BANQUET.

YOU ARE NOT HERE
TO ENJOY YOURSELF,

YOU ARE HERE
AS MY STAFF.

GO TO YOUR ROOM NOW.

LADIES.

I QUIT!

I CAN'T GO
THROUGH WITH IT.

WE COULD GO HOME.

Luke: GRANDMA,

EVERY MOTHER AND
FATHER IN ENGLAND

THEIR KIDS.

I KNOW.

WE MUST DO IT,
GRANDMA.

8:03 NOW.

I'LL REMEMBER.

LUKE, DARLING,
I'M SO TERRIFIED.

GRANDMA, NOW!

FOR THEIR PARTY.

THE SOUP ON THE MENU
TONIGHT IS COCK-A-LEEKIE,

AND VERY NICE
IT IS, TOO.

BUT I DON'T WANT
COCK-A-LEEKIE.

I DON'T LIKE
COCK-A-LEEKIE.

ORDER FOR CRESS.


WHAT'S THAT, EH?
