JUNG Jin-young

YANG Dong-geun

HAN Chae-young

KI Joo-bong, KIM Myoung-gook

Damn it!

He's probably faster
than Carl Lewis

He's definitely faster
than Carl Lewis

I'm a Korean detective

I always chase them

But there's nowhere for them to hide

No matter how fast they run,
they can't run away

Our country is surrounded by the sea

There's a huge army in North Korea

There's nowhere to hide

WILD CARD

Hey! Jay-soo!
Yes?

What are you doing tonight?
I have an appointment

Hey, I know you're lying.
How about a drink tonight?

It's my mother's birthday
Really?

Hey Cheol-gu!
How about a drink?

We're starting the Victoria
investigation today

Young-man, what about you?

I'm going with him

Aren't you going home?

Myung-hwan, how about a drink?

It's my wedding anniversary

Really?
Yes

Bastards

Mother's birthday and
a wedding anniversary?

Bastards

It's no use being nice
to those assholes

I should've worked them to the bone

Director KIM Yoo-jin

What about Ki-bok?
No, sir

Ki-choon?
Sorry, Mr. OH

Eleven of us are going in,
including Myung and Gahp

Are you making a soccer team?
You're not in charge now

I forced the youngsters to do it.
Forgive them

You forgot the magic word,
"Please"

Lieutenant! I'm going home

Where are you going?

I'm backing up Team 1 today

I see

Young-dahl, are you ready?
Go ahead

Hurry up

Jay, lock them up
Yes

Are you going somewhere too?

What's wrong with you?

A new investigation starts today

I understand

I've got a little time
for just one drink

Just forget it

Hey, c'mon

Hey!

This one looks expensive

It's just a restaurant.
Let's go in

Why is it so dark?
Turn on the lights

Happy birthday!

They are lovely

It's so nice to get flowers

I owe your wife.
Say thanks to her

Don't mention it.
They are all over my house

What is this?

Open it. You'll like it

Bremen...
They're Bremens

Made in Germany.
Swedish Raybeks were the best,

but now Bremens are better

Criminals like them because
they're light and comfortable

Right.
These old ones were too heavy

Why can't we make them like these?

They're just for criminals anyway

Ours are nice, too.
They are just heavy and loose

Remember Snakehead?
Yeah

One day I was writing a report
He says "Lieutenant" and

he looks at me and his wrists

And I noticed that
the cuffs were loose

I said, "What the hell"
and he put them back on himself

I searched the entire market for them

Whose idea was it?
Jay-soo's

Thanks boy

Lieutenant, why don't you try them on?

Okay

They're very light

I can't feel any weight

A toast for the lieutenant

For Lieutenant Biannual!
Cheers!

What is it?

I left it in the office

Don't be kidding

I'm not kidding

Hurry and go get it
before you drive him mad

Ok! Ok! Bastards

Everything is on me tonight.
The drinks, the karaoke, everything

Satisfied?

When you truly love someone

a million roses will bloom

Without hatred, just love freely

They buried him with a shovel

When's he going to stop?

I am sick of this song

When he sings it a million times

then the farmer ran for office!

A long life to you!

Who are they?

Looks like a new gang
Those rats...

Detective OH!

8 months ago, on March 5th at 2 am,

you shot twice at
the drug dealer suspect Hong

He accused you of using
excessive force. You know that, right?

Use of Force Rule clause 1,
The first shot must be a blank

Clause 2, you must warn them
to give up at least 3 times

If you shoot, you must shoot
the lower part of the body

Did you follow the regulations?

How can I tell someone
in a car to give up

and shoot the legs?

He was only 10 meters
away from you

10 meters or 100 meters,
What's so important about it?

It's important

He was only 10 meters away from you.
How could you shoot him in the back?

We had to catch him

That's a use of excessive force

Stop the bull shit!

He would sell drugs
even in a wheelchair

You were suspended for a month

in 1995 for the same reason

It was 25 days

That's it for today

Do you know that Korean Police work
more than 168 hours a month?

Quit if you are tired

We work 15 nights a month,
but they only pay for 75 hours

Quit if you don't like it

For the last five years, out of
all government employees,

police officers were most likely
to die on duty

Quit before you die

You memorized all that?

Of course
Why?

It makes me look cool

Excuse me. I'm doing random checks.
Your ID please?

KANG Nana 760624-2235013

58-2 Sinsa-dong Kangnam Seoul

Thank you for your cooperation

Find anything?

Looks like they killed her for money

What's that?
It's the CCTV tape

Did you contact her family?

Not yet

Then how are we going to
do the autopsy?

Who's going?

Chil-sun, stop by tomorrow morning

Um, I...

Is there a problem?

I'll go

Good

What are we going to tell them?

I feel like a confessing criminal

I have several things to ask you

Did you get any strange calls?

Any visitors?

No

I feel very...

Fucking killers...

She had a blow on the head.
No cuts or incisive wounds

The wound isn't sharp,

and the weapon could've been
a blunt metal object or bat

Right now, this tape is all we have

We can't tell anything except
that there were four of them

HAN Tae-jung, age 40,
a money exchanger in the black market

Her husband died 4 years ago.
She lived with her mother and two children

had about 2 million Won
and 2,000 US Dollars with her

It doesn't seem like
any kind of revenge

I see

Then, there's a high possibility
that it was just for the money

Criminal Team 3 take this case.
You had the best results last year

during the intensive enforcement period

That's it

Which do you hate most?
Rape or murder?

Murder

Me too.
Imagine yourself as a victim

Dying of no reason
all of a sudden

Fucking lunatics

At least robbers tell you to freeze.
These lunatics just kill

If someone strikes the back
of your head and runs away,

which way will he run?
The palace, City Hall,

the Arch or downtown?

Myung-hwan, tell me
Yeah?

City Hall
Downtown Downtown

But, how can you know?

Who knows where he'll go?

I wonder if the arrest rate is real

Cut it out

We don't need to spoil
the beer before we open it

What's going on?
Put that out!

Jay-soo, give me the names of
the subway stations in Seoul

Apgujung, Sinsa, Jamwon,
Cheongdam, Nonhyun, Hakdong...

Bus stops
Yeah?

Can you count them all?

You can't!

What are you going to do?

Young-dahl!

Arrest all the gangs in the area
and torture them until

we get something
Correct!

Patrol and patrol, work and work
and arrest anyone suspicious!

Report to me at 5 am.
Every morning

Chli-sun, what does that mean?

It means we can't go home

Over

You look awesome!

Mr. OH I work hard now

Hard?

You seem to be making easy money

Where's Sang-taek?

I haven't seen him for a while

You, you and you.
The three of you!

Be at the office with Sang-taek by 2

I really don't know, detective OH

Do you think I do?

2 o'clock. Ok?
Yes, sir

You're pathetic

Cover up!

What's wrong with your hand?

Got hurt
When?

A few days ago
Where?

At a nightclub, sir
How?

Opening a beer

Not opening someone's
head with that beer?

What? I'm a lefty.
This is my right hand

Horsenose and Hoon were there too

You can ask them

Then come to the office with
Horsenose and Hoon by 2 tomorrow

Yes, sir

Lie down

Myong-hwan!

What's up?

Got anything new?
Not yet

What about Chil-sun?

You ask me

Let's go. Catch you later

Take care

I like you and you know that, right?
Thanks

But sometimes you drive me nuts

What was Chil doing last month
during the intensive enforcement period

when we were risking our lives?

He arrested teenagers
fighting around schools

and tricked them into handcuffs
with pizzas

Only 16 or 17 years old!

I am not a teacher or a minister,
but it ain't right

You should talk to him!

Why do you always shut up
when it's about Chil!

Jay-soo...

I like you too

What brings you here detective

Don't worry

Take care, detective

That's mine

Treat others' things like yours,
you asshole!

How much do you get for these?

I pick them for 10,000 and
pass them on for 30,000

30,000? You said 15,000!

I knew you were cheating
Behave, you shitheads

Hurry and get in 1,2,3

Can't you get a bigger car?

From 8pm 23rd to 4am 24th

Write down everything
you did In detail

Where you ate and
when you shit. Everything!

If you fool around, you know
what'll happen. Do it now!

What are you looking at, asshole?

Sit straight! Where do you live?

Chamsil, sir

What does your father do?

Owns a gas station

Then you must be well off

Why the hell is a rich kid
doing such a thing!

What's his phone number?

His phone's not working
Not working?

Don't you dare give me bullshit!
Can I talk for a second?

Why? I'm busy

Look after him
Yes, sir

Is this your home?

What are you doing with a kid when
we are fucking after a murder case?

He had a knife.
You know that kind of kids

He was prying coins from
videogames They're on my desk

I used to have that kind of knife
at school, too

You can let him go with a warning

You don't know what you're saying

Those bastards turn into pickpockets,
robbers and killers

You got to nip out the bud

Not nurturing it?

What do you mean?
So you will send him to prison?

Perhaps you can recommend
a lawyer to his parents

You son of a bitch!
Don't talk to me like that

Right. I want the kickback
from the lawyer

Jay-soo, go in

I'm not working with that dirty cop

Son of a bitch

Do I have to work with disrespect?

Calm down.
What's wrong with you two?

You mean I'm wrong?

This is an emergency.
Jay-soo wasn't totally wrong

Hey!
Do you have a light?

There was a murder in the jurisdiction

This is a house of death

Who fights in a mourner's house?

After washing all the socks...

of those senior detectives,
and it's not turning out like

you thought it would?

Don't act like kids
after 10 years of experience

stubborn fools

Sook, where's my underwear?

Right corner of the bottom drawer

He's not the detective type

Why not?

What kind of a detective changes
his underwear everyday?

Right. Some don't change it
until the case is solved

Of course.
That's how it should be

The inspectors came by
They were very inquisitive

They even had the certification of
your family's land

So what did you tell them?

I almost said that
you're running to be buried,

not to get money

Just quit that job

Detectives who can't shoot.
What good are they?

Quit and water flowers?

Or you can run a karaoke

and sing A Million Roses
over and over

Enough. Let's go

Good night

The phone's ringing

Flower shop!

I'll burn your fucking roses bitch!

I'll shave your head and
shove it down the fucking drain

Your husband ruined me by
sending me to that fucking prison!

Where's your fucking husband?

Who told you to hang up bitch!
Do that again

and I'll fry you,
your husband and your baby!

You still don't get me bitch?

Why don't you call up his mobile?

It's 016-285-1605

You fucking

Son of a bitch

Why didn't you hit him, damn it!

A car was passing
Why did you hesitate?

They could've seen me
You should've hit him earlier

Damn it!
Stupid fucking loser

Fucking moron
Motherfucker!

You asshole!

Fucking hell!

Damn it, you think you can

just kick me out like that?

Drive in hell forever, motherfucker!

She's something

You like her?

Come on

Motherfucker! Get off me!

Let me go

Get off me! You assholes!

Help him

Hey, put that away

What's that?
Hold on

We'll send you to paradise

Stop it!

I'll do it! Stop!

Get that thing off me. Do it

Now you're talking

Motherfuckers! Go ahead

You motherfuckers!

Say something!

I was raped on a main street!

Not one but by four, damn it

The patrol car drove right by!
Are you cops blind?

I wouldn't have come here if
I was raped in a back street!

I won't put up with this

I'll sue the Korean government

And report this to the
Women's Association!

Bargirls can be raped on the street?

Who is in charge!
Where's the chief?

Please calm down

Are you the chief?
I'm a lieutenant

I don't want any lieutenants!
Where's the fucking chief?

Did they threaten you with a knife?

No

Any weapons?

Oh, they put a metal ball in my back
and almost crushed me

Let me see

I don't know

They all look the same.
It's damn confusing

Have a good look.
Only eyes are left now

What does the ID Team say?

It could be a metal ball given
the shape of the wound

Really?
Yes

Please take a closer look

She has such a temper

Biannual had a very hard time
Yeah, right

Who gave him that nickname?

Do you know?

His wife, when she was pissed off

Why?

He used to be number 1 in arrest rate

He'd catch one on his way to work
and two on the way back

Guess how many days he went home?
He lived in the office

Ah! He went home biannually

Use your brain!
He does her biannually

There must be a million in that bag

Look at that expensive watch.
He must be going to the dawn market

Oh my! Fucking old hobo

Let's go

Murders and thefts have occurred

in the downtown area

Yesterday at 5 am, a man in 70's

was found dead with
a wound in the head

The police are looking for witnesses,

and yet are investigating
the area for clues

Fuck! Fuck!
What?

This old man

If we had walked out from
that store 5 minutes later,

he wouldn't have died.
Damn it!

Where are you going?

Thieves will catch thieves

Come out, Teddy Bear!

Come on out, Teddy Bear!

Aren't you gonna come out,
Teddy Bear?

Gosh! It's being torn!

Hurry up. Teddy Bear

My brother's ruining your tables!

God damn it

Anything wrong?

Not at all. Please continue

You have good cards

I'll kill the Bulldozer...

Forgive me for not stopping by
for a while

Hey, the fabric's too soft

Hi, Teddy Bear
How are you, sir?

You look good

A small world is better
than the big cell, isn't it?

Of course, sir

Where's Sang-chun?
Sang-chun?

I haven't seen him
Really?

I heard you live off of dirty money

It's all I can do to feed myself, sir

Who gave you the money for
the gambling house

Fucking Sang-chun did, bastard
Where is he?

I don't know
Really?

You don't know?

I can find out through other sources

After wiping out this
place with the bulldozer?

Should I?

I will if you want

He'll kill me if he finds out

Who's Sang-chun?

You know the Elegance Gang party?

Hairtail, Flatfish, and that
bar owner Sausage?

He's their boss
Fucker of the fuckers

A king fucker

Sang-chun! Where are you?

Who is Sang-chun?
Your boss

There's no one here by that name

Excuse me, sir!

What's Sang-chun doing?

Sang-chun, where are you?
Shut the door!

What's Sang-chun doing?

Boss, look!

Oh dear

How can 2 devils appear
in this decent place at once!

I'll take care of them

No, they're not the corrupt kind

Don't make us go crazy

Where is he?

Who the fuck are you?
Who's talking so loud?

You look like a weasel,
just like your boss

Shut up you motherfucker!
You asshole!

Who are you?

Police

Don't kill all my boys

I won't hold back today!

Detectives!

How've you been, gentlemen?

You look marvelous!
This way, please

What are you doing?
Hurry and let them in!

They're new here.
Please forgive their rudeness

Please come inside

Please

What are you doing?

Go back to work!

Left turn, gentlemen

Hanna! Bring us the
sweet turtle blood

OK Ok OK

This is how I live

Anyway, what brings you here sir?

From now on, don't talk or ask

Why not, sir?

It's very disturbing.
Just answer my questions

You know that there'd been
two serial murders, right?

You can speak when I ask

I didn't know.
When did that happen?

I've no idea who they are
but they must be

Stop!

You are a legend among muggers.
You are a king to them

It doesn't make sense that
the king doesn't know anything

Gather your boys by tomorrow

I can't.
They'll starve to death!

You can't?

Giant Hotel lobby, restaurant row

Holy Nightclub.
Your muggers did all those

Excuse me, sir!
What are you saying?

They're not muggers. They just
took wallets from some drunks

They're just pickpockets

Why bring that up all of a sudden?

Those happened ages ago

There are tons of crimes to lock
you up. Want me to count'em?

That's enough

Call everyone. Hairtail, Flatfish,
Teddy Bear and Sausage

Everyone. No exceptions!

Sure, I get you

Enjoy the drinks

It's late

What are you doing?

Salute!

Excuse me. Random check.
ID please?

KANG Nana 760624-2235013

58-2 Sinsa-Dong Kangnam Seoul

Thank you for your cooperation.
Salute!

What do you think?
She's the one?

Isn't she awesome?

Yeah, she's great

Why are you staring at her?

No reason. She's too pretty

Very attractive, huh?

But she's stubborn

I checked her more than 20 times
and she never said a word

It'll never work empty handed

You have to give her something

Like a TWIX at least

What's this? Is this the criminal?

Detective, it's impossible

One third of Koreans look like this

Look!

Don't they look the same?

They look the same!

Hey!

They're identical

Aren't I right?

He's right

We can't catch them with these

Sausage!

You're the boss here, right?

You still call me Sausage

And no one calls me boss here
in this tiny bar

Sang gets 67.2%

and I get only 32.8%

You call 500 square meters tiny?

Underage girls and fake whisky,
it's all illegal

Be careful And never say
that we can't catch someone!

How many boys do you have?

I think there are roughly 100

Flatfish, what about you?

Less than 11, excluding school boys

No kidding. You have more than
50 in the restaurant

They're not mine anymore

Sang took them back two months ago

You little rat

What would they be doing now?

Horse racing, massage, billiards,

drinking and fucking

That's it!

Don't even think about
doing business now

Club guards, waiters, everyone!

Track down every single one
with a new face

This case was probably done by

either you or your boys

Detective! Robbery is a profession

We do it, but with discipline

Professional robbers wait for

victims to sit, lie down

and fall asleep

Robbers who wait are the professionals

Like you? How nice

Report to me every 3 hours and find
something within a week. Got it?

Detectives, why are you bothering

hard working boys like us?

Oh my god!
Call everyone and get this moving!

Are you a fuckin' pro or what?

Damn it!

You faked your average score

Aren't you going to play anymore?

Think you were me

Would you want to play with
someone who lies?

I didn't lie
You didn't? Fucking liar!

How could I lose 6 times in a row!
You bastard!

I told you to behave in my place!

Look bro, he cheated us

I lost 500,000 without winning once

What?

Damn it

Hey Minki! Long time no see

You look good with that nice jacket!

Not a tout anymore, huh

Still having fun at the horse races?

Who is he?

A friend of mine

Look who you're playing with!

Don't come around my neighborhood

I'll break your skull. Got it?

Get out of here!

What are you looking at, asshole?

This damn picture looks like everyone

You know him?

He was a manager when I was a tout

Gonna let them walk away?

Let's beat up the motherfuckers

Are you scared? Should I do it?

Enough. Stop it

You're scared. Aren't you?

Afraid of those chickens?
How embarrassing

If I want to beat them up, I will

Understand?

Return that 38 Special and
get a 22 caliber pistol

A 22 caliber is a toy.
It only leaves scratches!

I'll shoot when I have to

I'll even follow all the rules

A legal shooting

Fool!

Hey, bro!

It wouldn't be that bad if we didn't
have to do this stakeout, right?

C'mon

Where you going?

To shit

This is when criminals appear

They always appear
when you're alone

I'm leaving so they'd appear

It's so annoying

Are we going to listen to
A Million Roses a million times?

Damn it!

You have the right to remain silent and

Who are you?

Who are you?

Police

I'm a police, too

Hands off him
You gotta be kidding

Let's cuff him first and talk

All right

Am I Jesus or what?

Where are you from?

Gwacheon district

If it's not a problem,
give him to me

That's impossible

I'm a 116th graduate You?

Then you're 12 years junior to me

This isn't a military.
That's not important

Hey!
Don't be so rude!

Are you testing my temper?
Make my day. Go ahead and hit me!

What's going on?

Detective OH!
Hey KIM!

I heard you transferred to
Gwacheon district

Yes Is this fellow your wife?
Yeah, why?

Brother, pass that bastard on to me

I'll pay you back

Does he have a record?
4 convictions for mugging

Why are you alone?
Where's your wife?

He's been hospitalized because of
this bastard

I was after him for 3 months

3 months or 30 years,
it makes no difference. No is no

I beg you
I'll pay you back

I'll never need your help.
This is nonsense

Come on, bro!

Can't you do something?

What are you going to say?

Hand him over?
I'd do anything I'd sell my house

if you need money. But not this

I'm not doing this for the score

Don't mix public and private affairs!

Your fate belongs to Gwacheon

Can't we eat something else?
What?

Chinese noodles?

It's too late for orders
You just wait

Is that you? I haven't seen you
for a long time

I'm not busy at all.
I'm bored now

Where?

Stakeout?

Of course

I'll be there without god knowing

Where are you?

That's too far

Not that I don't want to go

The noodles will swell!

Oh No! Detective!

Damn it!

How could he do this to me
just because he got me a job!

An attack is the best defense

Everyone has a skeleton
in his closet

He that will steal a pin
will steal an ox

After a storm comes a calm

Mend the barn
after the horse is stolen

They that know nothing fear nothing

The end justifies the means

Opportunity makes the thief

What's that?

Delivery!
What the hell are you doing?

You're on a stakeout
Where's the food?

I changed it to fried rice
because noodles swell

Ok

Here it is

Delivery!

What?

Leave the dishes under the car

I'll pick them up without god knowing

Delivery!

How are you going to work with
such an unreliable source?

Hello?

Horse racing, massage, going through
money like water. Four of them

My boys caught them running
after committing an assault

Well done

Took care of them so they wouldn't
hurt themselves

Hey, Sang-chun
Yeah?

Good job but
Don't mention it...

You don't have to say anything

I'll do anything for you

I'll arrest you for imitating
a government official

if you impersonate a police officer
once again. Understand?

I'll keep that in mind

Don't do this again

I'll kill you for overdoing it

Turn around

Close your eyes

I'll poke out your eyeballs
if you open them

Turn around!

They're not the ones

No?

Boss, are you going to let them
treat us like this?

We're starving to death
by not focusing on our business

Let's dump them in the sea

or bury them alive

You don't know
what you are talking about

Do you know who Young-dahl is?

Remember the Regent Snatcher?

They destroyed 2 stolen goods storages
with a bulldozer because of my help

Really?

Really

I wonder

how did you two meet?

Us? You won't believe it

I am still furious

when I think about him

playing a trick on me

What do you mean?

When we were going out
he said he was an ethics teacher

What?

Jay! My daughter was this small
and now she's this big

Who measures height sideways?
People measure it vertically

It's because he only sees
her when she's asleep

Anyway, do you know BANG Gyusik?

BANG Gyusik?

He must have been released...
Why?

He calls everyday talking
all kinds of nonsense

I get lots of phone calls
but this one's the dirtiest

What was he in for?

He was in for
mugging about three or four times

Well, they should be in until they die

You get those kind of calls?

Are you kidding?
It's a monthly event

Let's go

Good-bye

See you
Take care

I'm worried to hear that
Why?

My wife will suffer from
those bastards too

They cry and threaten to leave
you, but after a while

they talk back dirty to them

She does?

Jay, do something tonight

I think I should
Here she comes

Why are you hiding?
Did you do something wrong?

Who's hiding?
Hurry and go talk to her, boy

Good luck, jay-soo!

Thanks ethics teacher
What?

Salute!

I'm random checking
passers by ID please

Nana KANG
58-2 Sinsa-Dong Kangnam Seoul

Thank you for your cooperation.
Salute!

Wait a sec

Thank you for your cooperation

Hey

You didn't have to throw them away!

The flowers are innocent.
Why did you do that?

Answer me!

Women who hate flowers
are not women

People say not to ever get
close to them

Flowers are hearts and
hearts are flowers, you know?

I said don't get close to women
who hate flowers and you

should've said Don't get close
to me then

Can't you talk back?

The Stone Age didn't end because
all the stones disappeared

Use your stone brain!
Why am I here with flowers?

I just want to talk to you

You are more stubborn than
a telemarketer

Look! You are as hard as iron

There is fungus around your mouth!

What is this?
I'm a police

Shut your fucking mouth

Police are not iron men

What do you think of them?

Don't they look cheap?
I thought so!

They seem to have some money.
Once cheap, always cheap

This place is losing its flavor.
We'll be ruined too

Let's go after a while

Thanks, honey

By the way, what do you do?

You look like a spender,
but not a gentleman

Take a guess!

Frankly, you don't look that
upright... like um...

Fucking whore, you talk like a bitch
What? A whore?

Now you're showing your real colors!
Hey, let's go

Who are these assholes?

Fuck you

I knew you were assholes

What are you doing?
I said let's go!

Bitch! Slut! Whore!

Stop it

Fucking whore!
You're gonna kill her

Shut your fucking mouth!

She has so much money!

Don't kill me.
Here's my card

The pin code is 8274.
Take them all

8274?
Yes

Thanks.
But don't you wanna play?

Don't kill me
Shake

Shake!
Please don't kill me

Minki! What are you doing?
Play the music!

Don't kill me.
Don't kill me, please

You fucking whore!
I told you to dance not beg!

I'll do anything,
please don't kill me. Please

Get up you fucking whore
Soochang!

She's begging you

You wanna live?
Yes

Bring the microphone

I'll spare your life if you score
more than 90

I can't sing

I can't...

Sing if you don't want to die

Push any number

Hey, what are you hesitating for?

I know that you want me

I know what you want

Come here, don't wait

I was waiting for you

I closed my eyes

and waited for you

So I could feel your love

Let's go

Today's your fucking lucky day

Thank you. Thank you

You can't run if you don't stretch

during the stakeout

Don't worry. I'm still quick

Hey, partner!

What?
Did you see that?

Look at those bastards

What should we do?
Should we get them?

Are you nuts?
We can't handle four. Wait

Young-dahl, it's Chil-sun

Four? Be careful while tailing
I'll be right there

I'm at the intersection. Where?

I see them. Ok

Don't look back

The pigs are following.
They're police. Pretend you didn't notice

There are two more in front of us

Run!

Get him!

Shit!

Freeze!

You asshole!

Get him!

Put that away.
There are people here

Someone call an ambulance

It's stuffy. I can't breathe

Don't move. If I pull it out,
you will die from loss of blood

You'll live

Just hold on

Myung-hwan! What happened?

You missed them?

Shit!
OK

I could have caught him.
Why didn't you let me shoot him?

You don't know who he was. You can't
just shoot someone because he is running

He stabbed someone

That was the result

You didn't know that
he'd stab him

I did
How?

Intuition

You can handcuff with intuition.
But not shoot, boy

You're not the judge

We just catch and judges will judge

There are rules and steps

Are you prudent? Or afraid?

I heard the bulldozer doesn't
care what he's bulldozing!

Damn! Where's your outrage!

How do you think you'd feel
after shooting someone to death?

It feels like shit to run over a dog

And this is a man

Do you think I was dancing
after I shot him?

I found it at the scene

Damn it!

You can't remember anything?

You're here

You're late
Yeah

That's not our ID Team

Due to the serial murders,
I asked for the Municipal ID Team

What's the result?
They're still working on it

Check the bodies

There's nothing to verify their ID

We should perform a ritual
or something

You can say that again

Turn off the lights, please

No special traces

They cleaned up everything

Turn it on, please

Long time no see, Mr. OH
Long time no see indeed

The Municipal ID Team
has appeared

Find anything?

Found few footprints
but that's it

Really?

Looks like she was hit
by a bottle

Get the fingerprints

Is this related?

We will see

Take the fingerprints please
Yeah

We can't verify ID
because there's no belongings

Really?
Yes

I'll get the fingerprints now

Who'll come along?

Sergeant KANG Nana

No smoking

You shouldn't have followed them

You're not Superman and

it's not smart to fight with four

There's fungus around your mouth

You can smoke

It must've been funny for you
in many ways

Your fingers are rigid

I know it's difficult for you
but please help

It must've been hard for you

The most terrible moment in your life

They hit you like it was a game

I know. They are fucking assholes!

They say that society abandoned them

but they're just cowards

You didn't deserve
anything like this

You see that man over there?

He doesn't look that reliable but

he'll catch the criminals for you

Wasn't it ridiculous?
For a squirt like me...

to ask for a date
I heard that

the veterans talk to the corpses

when the cases aren't going well

I'm not that advanced yet

I have so many things to
learn and do

So I'm not interested in dating

I'm sorry

Nice job

Keep it

Dork!

You're excited already

All your money goes to
horse racing

We shouldn't see each
other for a while

Be careful and don't call each other

I'll call you

Police are supposed to enforce
the law, not judge under it

We should refrain from using

guns as much as possible

The human rights organizations are

sensitive about excessive force

Disciplinary action will be taken
after some proper procedures

When I was new,
the veterans told me that

Guns are not for shooting,

they're to throw at the criminals

I never thought that'd be true

How did it go?

Not so good
And the result is?

They say they'll report later
Assholes!

Don't mind them

Yes, sir

Ok! They have the fingerprints!

Chil-sun, check the fingerprints

with the ID team

Who, me?

Yeah

I'll go

There are 479 cop couples,

2,394 female officers and

1,302 of them are married.
A little bit more than 50 percent

Do you know the percentage
of cop couples out of this?

I've no idea

I got the photo through the office

Not to make you happy
but because you'd be busy

Ok. Thanks

KIM Minki? Born in 1982?

How did you get his fingerprints?

We had nothing and

I desperately talked with the corps

Then I could get it off her watch

What about the metal ball?

I can't make an ID

You can't?

The prints are not registered

I see

Do you know that one third of

female cops are married to cops?

Not with their senior officers

I bet I'll be the first one

Who is this? The criminal?
Yes

Don't worry, detective.
My boys are all over this town

We'll get him immediately
with this picture

I'll ring you up right away

Time is ticking
I'll keep that it in mind

Take care!

You know this rat?
Yes

Call everyone!
What for?

We need to discuss

what we want in return

Yes, sir

Bulldozer

Jay-soo, pig heads

KIM Minki Born 1982,

Parents died in 1994 by car accident

Lived with an uncle

Sister died in 1999 from lung cancer

Not so well.
He hasn't come for 6 months

He wouldn't come here now

It's been a few days!

Jay-soo!

Give me a call

Look at him! Brother?

I think he has something

Baccar

Genghis Khan
Fine

Nobleless

I see. Fine
OK

Osung Hotel

Not that one

Why not?

Leave that one out

I'll see you some other time then
Hey!

What?
Are you playing with me?

People should pay for their sins

You know that better than me.
I'll see you later then

Hey, Sang-chun!

I'm a busy man

I thought we were done

Come here and sit

Ok, then

I see

Give me your detective book

I want to tear out the slave papers
with my hands

Quit it.
I don't want your information

I'll come back tomorrow with a list of your
criminal acts that haven't been arraigned yet

Let's go!

As you wish

Boss!

What are you doing?

They're all gone

Are they really gone?
Yes

Hurry up, dummies!
Go get them!

Don't blame it on me!
Hurry up

Sick bastard

You're guilty of so many sins!

No. Not that one

Cases can't be crossed out
without the victim's consent

Yes, sir. I understand

Cross out 2 more

Thank you. I appreciate it

Where's KIM Minki?

Chil-soon!

What the hell?

Get away asshole!

What were you thinking?

Damn it!

Let me go! God damn it!

Let me go!

Go! Go!

Asshole!

Are you ok?

When are you going to
do something?

What are you doing, you bastard?

Can't you see that
the lieutenant is hurt?

How come you're always
on his side?

Jay-soo

Jay-soo!

I know you're smart and brave

Chil-sun!

Do it right if you want respect!

I'll tell you one thing

Everyone has to share the blade's
cuts to survive

Remember that!

Me, the lieutenant and detective
MA went in the motel to

catch the Doobong gangsters,
and the hallway was curved

like this, this and this

I had a weird feeling

But what could I do?

As we went in, something struck us

MA was stabbed in the side,

and I got a sashimi knife in my thigh

I heard a crunching noise,

the bone was cracking

Damn it!

The main artery was cut
and blood was spurting out

Lieutenant tried everything

but it wouldn't stop

I thought I was dying

Detective MA died on the spot

I made it because of the lieutenant,

but my hands tremble

even when I see a toy knife now

It's so fucking embarrassing

It's time to quit

What's our secret weapon?

Our bodies

immortal bodies

What can we do?

We have to get over it

Look!

You see those kids?

They're orphans now

You won't talk

Right, you'll never talk

You are a faithful friend

Faithful friends never talk

Don't talk. Never talk!

I'll kill you if you talk!

Son of bitch

Sit down

Eat. You must be starving

What year are they living in.
Such use of violence?

Such old fellows

Relax and eat

You are only 21

You won't be able to get out
even on your 60th birthday

Don't you think it's not fair?

You said you were just
the look-out, right?

Tell us about the others

You don't have to bear all the guilt

Do you want an egg in it?
That's ok, sir

C'mon, eat!

You can eat eggs everyday
these days

I don't know about you

but I envied those who had

egg rolls in their lunchboxes

I was 7 and my parents died in
a car accident

and I lived with my sister

She delivered newspapers at dawn
and after school she glued dolls' eyes

She got 10 won per
one fucking eye

If she glued 600,
she got 6,000 won

One day I delivered
the dolls with my sister

One cold winter day

we delivered the dolls
to the market

We walked from store to store

to save on bus fare

It was cold

We were starving after walking
so much

My sister went into a store
and bought a boiled egg

She told me to eat
but I told her to eat

"You eat"
"No, you eat"

"You eat"
"No, you eat"

Then I hit it and

it was smashed

Then she beat me and said,

Why didn't you eat the damn egg?

We cried holding each other

I wanted to do
so many things for her

but she died of lung cancer

Poor girl

She was fucking pretty

He's a real detective now

When did his sister die?

He's an only child.
He has no sisters

What?

Act normal Understand?
Don't play any tricks

Hello?
This is the video shop

Return Girls' Dorm

This isn't the first time!
I'm not returning it!

Girls' Dorm? You scumbag!

Don't hang up before I say so
I see

Got any news?
Not yet

Go take a nap

I'm not sure I can sleep
Go take a sauna

I'll just have some coffee

Where are you?
Soochang!

Jaebong wants to see us.
Be there by 10

Ok

Where's there?

Take the other table!

Chil-sun, is that him?

Chil-sun!

Chil-sun?

What's he doing?

Get him!

Don't talk

Go get him!

Please, don't talk

Hurry and go

Ok, Ok

Please don't talk

You'll kill yourself. Damn it

Tell this asshole to go

Go, I'll take care of him

Go!

Come on! You fucking losers!

Put that down! Motherfucker!

Shoot!

Pull it!

Can't you shoot?

Should I pull it for you?

Use of Force Rule, you must tell
them to give up at least 3 times

Put it down

Don't put it down.
Now two more to go

Put it down!
No, Jay-soo!

Hold it just a little big longer

Put it down you motherfucker!

Put the gun down!

Jay-soo, you fucking bastard!

Fucking cowards

Chil-sun!

Did you get him?

Got him?

What was with you that night?

You were unlike yourself

Are you still wearing a cast?

Yeah, I'm not like I used to be

How were you before?

You don't know the real me

I caught two on my way to work
and three on my way back

Biannual!

Stitches, my stitches

Are you ok?

I'm ok

When you truly love someone,
a million roses will bloom

Roses of love
Without hatred, just love freely

How's it going with Nana?

I haven't seen her for 2 weeks

When I'm free, she's busy
When she's free, I'm busy

You can't even be biannual when you
don't even meet on a holiday like today

That asshole!

What is it?

Oh, shit!

Damn it!

They are always faster than us

We are always chasing them

Luckily there's a huge army
in North Korea

and the rest of the country is
surrounded by the sea

There's nowhere to hide
