Bunt!

Damn it, Bunt.
I told you to move that damn body.

Now do it. It's stinking the place up.

Here, boy.

Benzy!

Benzy, come on, boy.

Shoo!

Shoo, dog! Go on!
Get on out of here! Go on!

Wallace.

What a fine specimen.

Now, how could anybody want to
just throw that away

when it could be a new nose
or hide some hideous defect.

You is dead, Mr. Harley.

I seen you die.

You're living on borrowed time, Bunt.

Death is forever.

What you're doing is gonna cause you pain.

Sorrowful pain.

Kind that just never goes away
until the day you die and on and on.

I know. You know I know it.

Look at you.

The child you were all stripped away.
Look at you.

Don't bring that vengeance back
for a second time.

Don't do it.

Don't do it.

You keep out of my head, Ed Harley.

You keep out of my brain.

You stay where you belong, in Hell.

Hello!

Is anybody here?

I need to use a phone.

I need to call the police. Hello?

Bunt Wallace, stop your hollering...

How in the hell did he get in here?

After him, boys.

Don't let him get away.

This way.

Come on. Come on. Come on.

Where the hell have you been?

I found this here dog in the swamp.

I bet that's the stranger's dog.

Shoo, shoo, shoo. Benzy, go on!

Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo. Get out! Get out!

Hey!

He might have found something.

You got something there, boy?

We got a live one here!

Stop it, Tiny! Tiny, stop it!

No!

I'm not sure about this.

He's seen too much.

We can't let him go. Skin is skin.

And you know how much
a fresh kidney is worth.

Whatever you say, Doc.

That's my baby.

Pain is an interesting thing, gentlemen.

It doesn't happen here.

It happens in the brain.

And then the brain sends the message

to the body.

Beautiful.

You and Bunt get rid of him.

Yeah?

It's Doc.

You're late.

A kidney!

Whoa! Where did you get that?

How much can you get for it?

That's worth a small fortune.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Which takes care of the regular stuff.

Now, how about a little deposit
on that kidney?

Sorry, old friend.
I ain't got that kind of money laying around.

I write you an IOU.

And you think I can keep providing
free medical care for this town on IOUs?

Hey, Florence Nightingale.

You want to waste your money on charity,
that's your business. Not mine.

Help me!

You all right?

Oh, God, you okay?

Bodies. Corpses. Bodies in the woods.

Bodies in the woods!

Wallaces. They're doing it.
Who did this to you, mister?

Wallace Crematorium.

Wallace Crematorium?
The Wallaces did this to you?

Oh, God! Now, come on, now, get in the car.

You're going to be okay. Come on!

Oh, God, it's going to be okay.

Come on, now.

Oh, Lord, come on.

Sheriff Bullock, there's trouble.

Oh, boy, here we go.

A man's been killed out in the woods
by the Wallace Crematorium.

Just settle down, Molly Sue.

Is this another one of your episodes?

But he's in my car.

Are you two just gonna sit there?

Do you want me to call Oliver?
And have him come and get you? Huh?

You'll see. You'll see.

Hey, Sheriff, you better get out here.

Come on. Come on.

You pig!

Come on!

Keep your hands off of my brother!

Well, now.
Get in the car.

This certainly complicates things.

Why did you do it?

Well, you see, the oven's been busted.
I can't remember the last time it worked.

Shut up, Bunt.

Ain't you going to
read us our rights, Sheriff?

Scum like you Wallaces ain't got no rights.

You all are just like your Pa.

Cowards.

You...
Dahlia, no.

You look after them prisoners.
Yes, sir.

The news is gonna spread fast.

<i>And organize some volunteers from
the town. We've got to prevent a panic.</i>

Friends, I know these departed friends...

Did you see that?

You know, I just thought that...
Thought what?

That I'm still running around crazier than
a June bug in May because my baby died?

Sheriff, we just need to organize these folks,
and I got all the equipment we need.

What are you going to do, Sheriff?

I've got Doc Fraser here,
and I placed a call to the FBI.

They're gonna send a couple of
their top men out to investigate.

When?
In the next 48 hours.

And what about that man in my car?

I'll do an autopsy to determine
the cause of death.

Cause of death?

Can't prove the Wallaces
did anything otherwise.

Heck, Sheriff, I'm not even sure
what was done to these bodies is a crime.

Doc Fraser? The FBI?

And I thought you were the law in this town.

Oliver. Leave her be.

Whole town don't need to know
about you and her.

There's no "me and her," Molly.

Our mama's in there.

Spread out, now. Fan out.

All right, keep it going, boys.

We're getting closer.

Guys, over here.

We got something over here.

Oh, my God.

All right, we got to get them out of here.

Let's cover it up.
All right.

We done bad, Dahlia.

You know what centers on badness.

Pumpkinhead.

Shut up. Both of you.

Keep away from Pumpkinhead.

Unless you're tired of living.

His enemies are mostly dead.

He's mean and unforgiving.

Don't be a superstitious fool.

You hear me?

<i>No!</i>

I have never seen anything like this.

This is older.

Much older. Where did you find this one?

Deep in the woods.
There's an old pumpkin patch.

There are no children here, Molly.

What kind of animals would do this?

No!

No! No!

No, my baby.

No! No!

No, look what they've done.

Those monsters butchered my baby.

All right, Molly Sue.

I am so sorry.

No!

No.

It's the old woman. Of the woods.
The stories are true.

This one belongs to me.

Who are you?

You ought to have known better
than to disturb this one,

Sheriff Bullock.

Do I know you?

Molly.

Molly Sue, don't.

That woman is not the answer.

All the tools in the world
couldn't fix this, Oliver.

You're the one that lives
out by the razorback hollow.

People say you got powers,
that you can do things.

I can't bring back the dead.

People say you can help them
that was wronged.

You all have to come with me.
Where?

To see the old woman.
What for?

She can make it right.

What are you doing?
These ashes ain't your daddy's, Richie.

You're crazy.
I'm crazy?

You're crazy,
we're all crazy if we don't do anything.

Even Doc himself said he wasn't sure
what they did was a crime.

Are you all prepared to let
those sons of bitches get away

with what they did to our kin?

Richie, you know your daddy
wouldn't let them get away with nothing.

And I know you don't like me,
but we've been wronged.

Sheriff Bullock ain't going to do nothing.

The old woman will know what to do.

Well, I'm going if I have to go alone.

I know you're back there, Molly Sue Allen.

You brought your friends.

Powerful price for what you're looking for.

We'll pay the price.

This is everything we have. Everything.

What you want has a name, girl.

What's it named?

Pumpkinhead?

No.

Vengeance.

Vengeance.

That what you want, girl?

Yes. Yes, it is.

Vengeance. Raw and furious.

Say it.

Vengeance.
All of you.

Say it!

Vengeance.
Vengeance.

Vengeance.

Give me your hand.

This ain't your kind of medicine,
Ellie Johnson.

This more powerful.

Go ahead, Ellie. Do it for Mama.

Bunt.

It's all right.

Doc will come for us.

What the hell is going on in there, huh?

He's afraid of the thunder, is all.

He's coming for us.
Yeah, I bet.

Doc?
Well, open up.

Who's there?

Who is that?

You believe me now?

Junior, get the keys.

Junior!
Junior!

Oh, my God!

Molly?

Oh, my God. No, Junior, no. Junior!

Hurry, sister, hurry.
I'm trying! I can't even see it.

Hurry!

Come on, sister, come on!

Come on! Come on! Come on!

Get in the car!

Let's go! Come on, Dahlia, let's go!

It's coming for us. It's coming.
Dahlia, come on!

Come on!

Let's go. Let's go.

Someone's here.

Who is it?
It's a cop car.

What are you going to do?
Get out of here.

We're done for! Oh, man!

It got Junior and the deputy.

I can't believe it. Oh, my God.
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no!

We got to get out of here or we're dead.

Hey, hey, hey, hey, relax.

Crystal meth you all take's
making you paranoid.

It came for us.

We got to run or hide!

Do something, damn it!

Oh, God, I love it when you get all fired up.

Jeez, you're like a piss ant on a hot stove.

Now, calm down and tell me what happened.

Pumpkinhead, it's real!
I knew it.

Did you get my meth from Lenny?

Give it to me!

Tell me what happened first.

If I didn't see it, I would not have believed it.

Well, did it...
I don't know, did it say anything?

Say anything?

It just kills. It doesn't stop for a chat.

Tiny.

You get rid of that car.

Anybody sees that or you lot around here,
we got problems.

Bunt? You and your sister upstairs.

Till I figure out what we're gonna do.

I wish you'd stop taking all that bad stuff.

Makes your brain all fuzzy.

We got to figure out what we're gonna do,
or we're gonna die.

All of us.

It's open. What's the matter with you?

Doc?

Oliver. Molly Sue.

Can we come in?
Sure, sure.

We can come back if it's a bad time.
No, that's okay. You come right on in.

I'm not feeling too well.

I'm sorry to hear that, Molly Sue.

You come right on through.

Bunt!

You know,
I think the stress of the last couple of days

has caught up with you, Molly Sue.

You had a chance to rest?
No, I haven't slept since...

You went out in the woods, too.
I went for a walk, that's all.

Thought it might help clear my head.

Well, after all that's happened,
I'm not surprised you feel lousy.

Do you remember those breathing exercises
I had you do

when you were a kid and you felt this way?

That's right, nice and easy.

And I... I think these might help as well.

Now, if there is anything else you need,
don't hesitate to call me.

All right?
Yeah.

Reverend McGee is holding
a memorial service later on tonight.

I'll be there, Oliver. I'll be there.
All right.

Well, we got to get you home.
Get yourself some rest.

It's here!

It's here! It's here! It's here!

It's Tiny. What's he doing on the roof?
Open the window, Bunt. Open the window.

Open... Open the window. Please.
Please, hurry up.

Open the window!
I can't. It's stuck!

Open the window!
What the hell is all that yelling?

Open up the window.
It's Tiny. He's outside on the roof.

Bunt, Bunt, open the window.

Oh, no!

Help me! Help!

Come on! Help! Help!

Tiny! No!
Tiny! No!

No, Tiny, no.
Now you believe us?

We got to get out of here! Now!

No! No!

Help me!

Molly Sue?

No, no, Bunt.
Maybe it doesn't know we're here.

No, it's seen us.

Would you get in the car?

Or we're leaving without you.
Come on, Bunt, come on.

Move!

Molly?

We asked for it.
Doc, stop at Lenny's.

Will you two shut up? I can't think.

But there has got to be an explanation.

We're marked.

Yes, you are, Bunt Wallace.
You reap what you sow.

You're all marked.

No, it's not my fault, Ed Harley.
It's not my fault.

Why don't you tell that to God
when you see him?

I just laid down with the dogs and got fleas.

No!
What the hell is wrong with you?

Dahlia, you keep this boy under control
or we're gonna leave him behind.

No, I'll behave. I promise I will, Doc.
I'll be good.

Doc!

Doc! I think Dahlia's dead.

Is she dead?
No, she's not dead.

All right. You take it easy with her.

And you get your head out of your ass.

Or you are not gonna have to worry
about this thing that's chasing us.

Come on!
Yes, sir.

Come on.

How much further we got to go, Doc?
In back of the church.

Now, be quick
before somebody sees you two.

Keep on going, Bunt.

This will be a safe place for us while
I figure out what the hell we're gonna do.

Put her down there.

She gonna die?
No. Well, I don't think so.

Bunt, what do you know
about this creature?

You saw it when you were a kid, right?

Bunt, this is important.
I can't.

Is it any different?

It seems a lot bigger
than the first time it did its killing.

Who'd it kill?

<i>There was those city kids.</i>

<i>They done Ed Harley wrong,
they killed his boy.</i>

What did Ed do to them?

Ed Harley went to see the old woman
who lived out by the razorback hollow.

I know who you're looking for.
Her name's Haggis.

I helped him find her.

That's right, Bunt. You're telling it right.

You led me straight to Hell.
No!

Bunt?

Bunt?

Go on.

I don't know what happened
at that witch's place,

but it must have been something bad
'cause it just started killing those kids.

What did?

Pumpkinhead.

And, now, it's coming after us.

It'll get those that are marked
and anyone who tries to stop it.

I felt bad.

I told Mr. Harley where to find that witch.

So I tried to help those kids get away,
and I almost got killed myself.

There weren't no killing it.

Well, something stopped it.
Well, Ed Harley stopped it.

How?

You've got to ask him yourself.
Well, now, I can't do that, can I?

Well, sure you can.
He's standing right behind you.

He killed himself and then that girl shot him.

Ed Harley shot himself?

He tried to anyways. She shot him dead.

That's music from the church.

Bunt, I want you to stay here
no matter what.

But what about Dahlia?
Don't move her on any account.

Oliver. Molly Sue.

Thanks for coming out, Doc.

What happened to your head?
My head?

It was just a little accident,
nothing to worry about.

How are you feeling?
Oh, much better. Thanks.

In Genesis, we know that God saw
that the wickedness of man was great,

but that there was room for repentance
and acceptance.

Forgiveness, friends.

Sin is not born here in our minds.

No, it starts here in our hearts.

But it is in our hearts
that we can also find forgiveness.

We are gathered here, tonight,
in a spirit of hope and healing.

Dahlia!

What happened?
It's come for us. Listen!

It's out there. I know it is.
How do you know it?

Listen!

We will go forth my friends
into a new peace...

It is gonna be all right, Bunt.

I just know Doc will take care of us.
I mean, he always has.

And find a place in our hearts for...

From dust we are born
and dust we shall return.

Ashes to ashes, dust to...

Ronnie! Ronnie!

Hey, Ellie, Ellie. It's too late.
No! No!

I'm afraid Ronnie didn't make it.
No. No.

Oh, my God. That's smoke. Move, Bunt.

Help!
Let us out! Let us out!

Okay, all right.

It's done, doll face.

It's over.

Oh, no, it ain't.

No!

Is this what you wanted?

This killing?
Why did it come to the church?

Molly Sue, you're not even listening to me.
Who was it after?

Could be after anyone.
No! Only those who are marked.

Do you know how you sound?

Ronnie's dead. Who's next?

The ones that did us wrong.
Us?

Is there anything left of us?

You're turning into a monster yourself.

Get him down from there
before somebody sees him.

But Doc...
Can't leave him there.

Do it for your cousin's dignity.

You think I'm going to be all right?
Yeah, I think you'll be fine.

You just got yourself a little concussion.

Oh, Tiny, I'm so sorry, this is my fault.

Oh, look at you.

Should be me, not you.

None of this should have happened.
Ed Harley was right.

Ain't no good
ever come out of no vengeance.

Ain't no good at all.

We've got company.

It looks like Oliver's car.

You stay put, and I'll get rid of him.

Oliver!

How is Molly Sue feeling?
Awful.

And I had no one else to turn to.

You know, you've been taking care of her
since she was a little girl.

And I thought... Are you okay?

Oh, I was thinking, Oliver.

It seems like the very Devil himself
has taken up residence in our little town.

That's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

Molly Sue went to see that old woman.
And she ain't been right since.

Did you go with her?
No. God, no. In fact, I begged her not to.

Well, who went with her?

Richie and Ronnie Johnson,
the kid that was killed.

Did anyone else go?
I'm not sure.

Do you think that the old woman is a witch?

That she can do things?

I have no idea.

All I know is, after what I saw,
I could believe anything.

Oliver, I am truly sorry
for everything that has happened.

We will find a way to put it right.
Stop it at least.

You're a good man.
No problem, Oliver.

Thank you.
Any time.

You look after yourself.
I will.

Oh, and be sure to
give my best to Molly Sue.

I will. Take care.

Oh, Tiny!

Tiny!

We've got to call this thing off.
How are we going to do that?

Ronnie's dead. My brother is dead
and he's not coming back.

That wasn't supposed to happen, Richie.

We should have just
let Sheriff Bullock do his job.

What did you ask that old witch to do?

Where's Molly Sue?
At home.

She might know how to stop it.
She doesn't want to.

She wants to see this thing run its course.
Doesn't matter who dies.

Even if she passes.
Ask the old woman, she'll know.

Lf we go back, we could...
You can't go back.

You have a head injury, you need to rest.

I can go.

I went with them, too, to see the witch.

I asked for... For vengeance.

I'm sorry, Oliver.
I thought it was going to be justice.

I was wrong.

How are we gonna stop this?

I should dig three more graves, for us.

How many times have you seen me
save someone's life in this town?

It's what I do. It's in me. It's part of me.

Or what makes you think
that when the time comes

I won't be able to save my own skin
and you two along with me?

Besides, I am never gonna
let anything hurt my baby.

It's just that I...

I am a man of science.

I study situations, Dahlia.

Eyes and mind always open,
always thinking.

For every action there is a reaction.

And in this case, it is those that visited
that witch that raised that monster.

If we get rid of them,
our little problem goes away.

And how are we gonna do that?

Don't you worry yourself
about that, doll face.

You just put your faith in the good doctor.
He'll save your ass.

Dahlia, I want to go home.

Why have you come back, Ellie Johnson?

To see if there is a way to stop it.

We need to call it off.

You did not ask for your wrong
to be righted, Oliver Allen.

But I did, and now my brother is dead.

You thought you could just
call his name and that would be all.

There are those who are marked,
and those who are damned for asking.

I can't stand it. We're all going to Hell.
You have to stop it.

Can't do anything for you.

What if we right the wrong?

What if we make things
the way they were supposed to be?

That'd be some powerful magic.

Can you teach me that trick, boy?

He was just asking for me.

You are now one with vengeance,
Ellie Johnson.

It must run its course.

You live and die by it now.

I don't want vengeance anymore.

Ain't your choice now.

You don't scare me, old woman.

Everything has an end.

This, too.

You know, I think we can fix this.

We don't need no magic.

Maybe if we cremate those bodies
the way they were meant to,

then the wrong becomes right again.

I can smell you out there, Bunt Wallace.

You'll find no pity here.

Richie!
Doc, what's going on?

I wanted to see how you were doing.

When you didn't answer the door,
I was worried.

I let myself in.

Must have been out cold.
My head hurts, pretty dizzy.

Let me take a look at this for you.

You Doc? Why?
It's here for me, isn't it?

Who else, Richie?
Who else called on this thing?

See you in Hell, Doc.

Richie?

He's dead.

This is Doc's.

How could Doc
have anything to do with this?

Who else in this town would know
how to do that to a person?

Oh, God, what are we gonna do?
I'm thinking.

Maybe if we can get that crematorium oven
going and cremate the bodies,

I think it would stop the killing.

And us?

Do you think the others
are gonna be in danger?

Molly!

Molly Sue?

You're in danger.
We're all in danger.

Doc Fraser has something to do with this.
I think he killed Richie.

And he's gonna kill everyone
that raised the demon.

And that includes you.

And people in this town think I'm nuts.

I know a way to stop this insanity.

Where are you going?
I can't stay here.

I'm going to the Sunny Days Motel,
anywhere but here.

You're running away from the truth.
I can fix this.

You've always been able to fix anything.

But this ain't something
you can tighten with a wrench.

Molly Sue. Molly...
It's over, Oliver.

Molly!
It has been for a long time.

Would you just...

And don't think I don't know about
you seeing that whore, Ellie Johnson.

Molly? Molly Sue.
It's over and I'm gone.

Molly Sue!

You and Pocahontas want to save the world,
that's your business.

I'd rather burn in Hell.

Bunt, let's go! Bunt, move!

I am not telling you again!

Bunt Wallace, stop playing your games.

What game is he playing, Dahlia?

Where the hell did he go?

I don't know.

Oh, well.

He can be the worm wriggling on the hook
for that son-of-a-bitch critter chasing us.

Don't be a mean old man.
We have got to find him.

Hey, take it easy.

No, I will not take it easy.
And I ain't going nowhere without him.

Or your crystal meth?

What do you mean?

Well, what's gonna make
you happier right now?

Tramping around the woods looking for
your brother or a little of Lenny's magic?

You know which one
you can't truly live without.

Oh, it's all right, baby.

I understand.

Seems that roach motel Lenny calls home
is a popular spot right now.

Well, I can kill two birds
with one stone there.

Open the door.

Your music's too loud!

Who are you?

I'm next door and I can't think.

Open the door.
Coming!

Open the door!

Open the door!
Coming.

Wow.

Why don't you join the party?
No, I don't think so.

Don't be shy.

We've got everything you need.

For a party.

Don't take another step.
I just...

Whoa. Take it easy, lady.

Crazy bitch.

Look, lady, I don't want no trouble.
What's wrong with you?

Open up, Lenny. It's us!

What the hell is the matter with you?

High or something?
You'd better have saved me some.

Some psycho bitch was just here,
waving a gun around.

Who was she?
I don't know. Local girl or something.

This tall?
Yep.

Blonde hair?
Yep.

Big blue eyes?
That's her!

I just asked her to party
and she got all crazy.

Where is she staying, Lenny?
Next door.

You know her?
Oh, yeah.

We got some business with her.

But, first...

What you got cooking, Lenny?

Lots of good things.

You want to see it?
Show me.

Let's get high!

Bunt...

What are you waiting for, Bunt?

Get it over with.

Run, run, run, run.

Can you pass me the pliers?

Ellie?
I'm Bunt Wallace.

I know who you are.

I don't like who I am.

I know we done you folks a powerful wrong.

But Doc said,
"It was to help heal the town's living. "

He said,
"The dead don't know nothing about pain. "

But he ain't right on that score.

'Cause I know Ed Harley's still hurting.

I know I'm gonna be punished
for what I've done.

But until I do, maybe I could help you.

You think you can help me
get this thing going?

We could try.

Lenny, the master chemist!

That was the best batch ever.

Will you two hush up?

Give it a try.

Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.

So what are you gonna do, Molly Sue?

Shoot me?
Maybe.

How old were you when I saved your life?

How could you be one of them?

I think you were 12.

Or was it 13?

Do you remember? Oh, no.

Of course, you couldn't, could you?
Because you were too sick.

I don't understand.

They're just vessels.

Those people aren't
in their bodies once they die.

They feel nothing.

What about that hiker? You killed him.

Oh, I had no choice.

It was him or the health of this town.

How else do you suppose
people around here

afford the kind of health care I give them?

It has to be paid for somehow.

You can do it.

Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.

I wouldn't do that, Doc.

I have only ever tried
to help people, Molly Sue.

That's a lie.

I didn't take your baby from you.

You took her dignity.
You butchered her, you monster.

You better put that gun down.

You are not gonna shoot me.

I might not have to.

No.

Hey there, darling.

I think Lenny might need a doctor.

Hey, what is it?

Hey, what is it?

Hold me.
It's gonna be okay.

Trust me.

We would have been good together.

You's the Devil, ain't you?

Take me home.

I'm the last of those that summoned it.

I feel it taking me. I'll be lost to you soon.

Almost over, ain't it, Bunt?

She's as doomed as you are.

Make it stop.

That's right, Ed Harley.
Make it stop.

Vengeance is coursing through her blood.

Poison.

Now that's a sorrowful thing.

Doc?

I told you I could stop this.

No!

It didn't work, Oliver.

It's still alive. It didn't work.

Oliver! Look out!

Ellie, no! Ellie!

Ellie!

What happened here?

Where's Sheriff Bullock?

He placed a call for some assistance.

He's dead.

Who's responsible for all this?
Vengeance.

Pumpkinhead.
Come on, boys.

Pumpkinhead.
We're gonna need to

take you in for some questioning.
Let's go.
