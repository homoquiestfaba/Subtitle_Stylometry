1
00:00:35,513 --> 00:00:37,167
[panting]

2
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,358
[birds chirping]

3
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,099
[heroic music]

4
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:37,592
[man] It was the summer 
of 1875

5
00:02:37,722 --> 00:02:39,811
and McKennna was 
a long way from home.

6
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,859
He was married
to an Indian girl,

7
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:46,557
daughter
of the tribal elder.

8
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,474
She was waiting for him
in a cabin on the mountain.

9
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:53,303
She had a fever

10
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,741
and he'd ridden his horse
to death,

11
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,570
to get back
with medicine for her.

12
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,942
[panting]

13
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:27,859
There were dangers
in the forest that night,

14
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,514
not just the wind
and the rain, and lightning.

15
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,170
A gang of cutthroats,

16
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,522
hired by timber agents
from the Northern Pacific
were waiting for him.

17
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,048
They wanted his trees
for railroad ties,

18
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:44,702
but he wouldn't sell
and he wouldn't deal.

19
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,052
It was Indian land,

20
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:50,360
given to him
by his wife's father.

21
00:03:57,715 --> 00:04:00,370
He could sense the danger
but by then it was too late.

22
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,817
They caught up with him
on the trail about the river.

23
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:25,613
[grunting]

24
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:36,580
McKenna fought them
in the way of the Indians.

25
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:42,020
Launching and spinning,
grappling and swirling.

26
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,589
[grunting]

27
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:55,556
They had their guns,

28
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:58,950
but every part
of Jedidiah McKenna,

29
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:01,692
a man hardened by rain
and fire on the mountain,

30
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,520
every part of him
was a weapon.

31
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:07,437
He was alone
and there were six of them.

32
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:09,787
[grunting]

33
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:11,006
[man] Look out!

34
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:20,015
Then there were five.
[laughs]

35
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:26,848
[yelling]

36
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:41,732
McKenna had run 40 miles,

37
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:45,954
from a trading post
on the Columbia,

38
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:47,434
but he was winning,

39
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:49,827
he was billing them.

40
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:55,006
[yelling]

41
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:13,895
[grunt]

42
00:06:21,076 --> 00:06:22,512
They shot him though.

43
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:25,036
Cowards that they were.

44
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:31,478
And he fell tumbling
and rolling

45
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,437
down into the white water.

46
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,547
[girl] He never made it
back to her?

47
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,071
He just drowned
in the river?

48
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:04,946
Come on, you guys.
I mean, the guy was shot.

49
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:07,209
He didn't have to drown,
he was already on his way
to the boneyard.

50
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:10,430
He maybe is the river
in our mountain.

51
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:13,345
This is the Bigfoot story?

52
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:15,043
Sasquatch,
is that was this is?

53
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:16,610
No.

54
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,002
Is not about Sasquatch

55
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,789
or the river or the gun.

56
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:27,229
And you were right, Austene.
He never saw his wife again.

57
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:30,145
But he never left
the mountain either.

58
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:35,759
[peaceful music]

59
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:50,426
[man] He was cold, 
lost in the eternal darkness,

60
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:53,124
lying on the river bank 
in the wilderness.

61
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:02,307
[snorting]

62
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:05,789
But this time 
he was not alone.

63
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:10,664
The forest spirit found him.

64
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,799
This one had taken the form
of a great bear.

65
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,714
[growl]

66
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,742
This is how the legend began.

67
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:49,964
The Legend of the Spirit
of the Mountain.

68
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:51,661
I'm sure about this legend.

69
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,230
We've all heard little bits
and pieces of it.

70
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,539
But he was shot,
wasn't he?

71
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,977
And he was drowned,
wasn't he?

72
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:05,196
[Brian] Guys,
legends aren't true.

73
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,329
They're just things
that people want to be true.

74
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:09,592
I don't know what better
than to believe on it, Brian.

75
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:12,421
-It has to be some good in it.
-Justin is right, Brian.

76
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,989
Must legends and folklore
are based in facts.

77
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,034
That's right.

78
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:19,950
McKenna was shot.

79
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,345
He was in the river
all night.

80
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:39,230
[growling]

81
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,940
[screech]

82
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,943
[roaring]

83
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:02,602
[screech]

84
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:13,656
[roaring]

85
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:34,808
[twinkling]

86
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,375
In the magic glade

87
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,074
deep entangled

88
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:42,729
all those years ago,

89
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:45,819
the power of the forest,

90
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:50,954
the power
that could restore life

91
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:54,088
to any human
or beast harmed by another,

92
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:58,309
that power was called down
by the bear

93
00:10:59,484 --> 00:11:01,748
and it touched McKenna.

94
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:05,447
And the spirits
of the mountain joined in him.

95
00:11:25,162 --> 00:11:27,687
Then, the bear,

96
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:30,385
the wolf,

97
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:32,692
the eagle

98
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:37,392
became one in McKenna.

99
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,396
He could become all of them.

100
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:45,226
In the Indian legend,
a shape-shifter.

101
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:49,534
And he would stay forever
to protect the mountain

102
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:52,276
and everything
that lived there,

103
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,104
and everyone who loved it.

104
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,063
You mean he's a spirit now?

105
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,370
A spirit of the mountain?
Like a ghost?

106
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,764
No, no, not a ghost.

107
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:08,205
McKenna's spirit embodies
the strenght of the balance
of nature.

108
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,558
[man laughs]

109
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,212
Well, that's enough for now.

110
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,956
We better go now
or we'll late
for the big shindy.

111
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:23,090
[man] I'll tell you some
more another time.

112
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,440
-Wait. Mr. Madison?
-Yeah?

113
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,097
What's a shape-shifter?
You know, like the one
in the Indian legend?

114
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:34,884
Well, Justin, a shape-shifter
can appear a human,

115
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,713
who has the ability
to take the shape

116
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:40,063
of those creatures
he loved in life.

117
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,070
He can even see through
your eyes into your soul.

118
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,510
No kidding?

119
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,992
[chuckles]
No kidding, Logan.

120
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,385
Let's go!

121
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:00,562
Ready to go, Justin.
We won't be late.

122
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:03,217
Yeah, I'll be right there.

123
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:04,392
[woman] Make sure
to put the fire out, honey!

124
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:06,350
Yeah, yeah.

125
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:09,005
-[Madison] Stacy.
-What are you've been up
to out there?

126
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:11,442
-You're looking very pretty.
-Thank you.

127
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:13,575
What do you think about
this big "get together."

128
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:15,620
Everybody knows
what I think.

129
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,405
Do you think Mr. Madison
makes it all up,

130
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:20,495
you know,
about the legend
of Tanglewood?

131
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:23,628
[Brian] Come on! He knows
we hang around
the old tree house.

132
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,543
He just wants to give Logan
the creeps. That's all.

133
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:32,594
That is so sad.

134
00:13:33,508 --> 00:13:34,814
What's sad?

135
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,905
He never got to see
his wife again.

136
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:40,950
Yeah, that's sad.

137
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:50,264
[man] All we're talking about
is cutting down
a few old trees, alright?

138
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:52,962
I understand,
and to all of your concerns
I'm still one of you,

139
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,877
and like one of you,

140
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:57,575
I only want what is best
for this community.

141
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,317
But remember,

142
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:02,711
the unharvested riches
that we have on our mountain

143
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:06,454
can only bring
prosperity and hope

144
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:08,499
for our future,
here in Tanglewood.

145
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,415
Excuse me, Mr. Thorne,

146
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:15,158
sounds like
Thorne Lumber Company
stands to benefit a whole lot.

147
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,378
What about our alternatives?

148
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,162
What about the wildlife?

149
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,295
What about
our nature conservacy?

150
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,732
My staff and I are fully aware
of the alternatives.

151
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,517
But folks,
let's be reasonable.

152
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:31,566
I mean,
the nature conservacy?
There's no money on that.

153
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:34,308
And I think it's obvious
to you all hardworking people.

154
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:37,615
But my harvesting proposal
is gonna change
this town around.

155
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,356
And that's
what we all want, isn't?

156
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:41,141
-[woman] No!
-[cheering]

157
00:14:41,271 --> 00:14:43,230
[whistling]

158
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:45,754
My lawyers,
my colleagues here,

159
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,496
will be glad
to answer any questions
that you may still have.

160
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:50,715
And I want to thank
all of you for coming.

161
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:52,369
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

162
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,764
Very good.

163
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,245
-I think they'll come around.
-It's lovely.

164
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,334
You two don't know
what the hell
are you talking about.

165
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:03,641
[playing country music]

166
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:16,306
-Can I offer you some punch?
-Thank you, Austene.

167
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:17,655
-Having fun?
-Yeah.

168
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,353
No.

169
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:23,531
It's hard to believe that boy
comes from this parts.

170
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,316
He's driven by nothing
but grieve.

171
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:29,406
I don't get it.

172
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:31,365
What are they willing to do
to our mountain?

173
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:35,369
You know, Logan,
how can we be related?

174
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,501
They're just gonna
pick it clean, bonehead.

175
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:39,590
Hey! Don't call me
"bonehead", bonehead!

176
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:41,766
-Don't touch me.

177
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,465
I guess we're just let
the Town Council decide

178
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,684
if that Thorne guy
can log them out.

179
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:48,686
Well, my dad is
a logger, too,

180
00:15:48,817 --> 00:15:51,341
and he's never, ever,
cut down those old trees.

181
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:53,648
Yeah, you know,
Mr. Madison says

182
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:56,042
those trees are 600,
800 years old.

183
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:57,173
No kidding?

184
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:59,306
No kidding, Logan.

185
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:01,482
Brian, what are you...?

186
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:03,310
[scoffs]
Oh, that's attractive.

187
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,312
Oh, come on, you guys.

188
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,749
Oh, Lord, help me survive
my older son's appetite.

189
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,664
Let's go.
We got a big day tomorrow.

190
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:12,754
Yeah. Logan becomes
an official Lord of Tanglewood.

191
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:14,364
Tomorrow.

192
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,240
Where's your jacket, honey?

193
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:27,769
-Daddy, where you've been?
-I got delayed.

194
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:30,685
I didn't mean to be late.

195
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,601
I'm sorry, honey.

196
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:37,257
I... I'm sorry,
but you know...

197
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:40,390
Yes, Daddy.
I know.

198
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,659
They're talking about
the mountain and...

199
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,706
it could mean
"new job."

200
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,016
It could mean everything
for us.

201
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:01,890
I... I should just stay.

202
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,414
They can decide it
without us.

203
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:06,068
Come on, Daddy,
let's go home.

204
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:08,462
You need some sleep.

205
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:13,075
Yeah... I'm pretty tired.

206
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:16,557
Daddy, we'll walk.

207
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:24,782
[Shirley] Come on.

208
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,615
Good night, Daddy.

209
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:35,201
[Austene] Please help my daddy 
to be strong and healthy.

210
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:39,640
Bless our mountain

211
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:44,558
with a gift of melting snow,

212
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:50,216
a heart that give life
to our forest.

213
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,610
Please try to find a way
to save it.

214
00:18:57,788 --> 00:19:00,139
Bless Mommy,
wherever she is.

215
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,840
And give her a thought of me
and Daddy once in a while.

216
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,627
We need your help so much.

217
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,809
So much.

218
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:23,510
Amen.

219
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:26,252
Amen.

[birds chirping]

223
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:16,954
Remember, Logan,
this is your first trip
to the mountain.

224
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,391
I want you to listen
to your brother.

225
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:20,654
Give me candy, Brian.

226
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:22,743
Listen to your brother,
and do everything
he tells you to do.

227
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,266
-Everything?
-No!

228
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:30,011
Brian, give me the candy.

229
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,665
You had a good breakfast
this morning.

230
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:33,144
-[Brian] No.
-[Shirley] No? Yeah.

231
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,016
OK, you guys,
have a good time.

232
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:37,279
[Justin] What's up, dudes!

233
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,673
-[Justin] Let's go! Let's go!
-[Austene] Hi, guys!

234
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:42,197
[hubbub]

235
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:44,808
Listen to what
your brother says,
you understand?

236
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:46,897
[kids yelling]

237
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:48,899
I want all you kids
to watch out for Logan!

238
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:54,992
And chat with Clovis
before you leave town!

239
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:56,951
-[Logan] Thank you, Mom!
-Uh-huh.

240
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:00,259
He'll call me if you don't!

241
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:13,794
[ominous music]

242
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:47,697
Thorne, this nature
conservacy thing is
nothing more than a threat.

243
00:21:47,828 --> 00:21:50,352
They'll yield.
The bottom line is greed.

244
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:52,920
-There's nothing like it.
-Well, you should know.
Williams!

245
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,052
You handled that impeccably.

246
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:57,664
The prosperity and progress
are always the best bait.

247
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:59,927
I couldn't care less about
the progress of anyone

248
00:22:00,057 --> 00:22:02,190
except Travis Thorne, boys.

249
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:04,758
And so should you, too,
because I'm your meal ticket.

250
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,934
Williams, I want you
to get survey teams

251
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:08,109
on top of the mountain,
first thing in the morning.

252
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:10,764
Set up grids
for clear cutting.

253
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:12,809
30 million board-feet
of lumber are up there
and I want it all.

254
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,595
-You wanna use local labor?
-What for?

255
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:18,249
They don't want to cooperate.
Scruples.

256
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,817
-What?
-Scruples, boys! Scruples!

257
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:23,603
Like they sizzle
in their own grease.

258
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,866
[laughing]

259
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:28,085
We'll get a temporary permit,
we'll scrap the place,

260
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:30,218
we'll have our money
in the bank before
they can file on us.

261
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,786
And then you two geniuses,

262
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:35,789
you'll just bury them
in paperwork

263
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,443
until hell is
a ski resort.

264
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:41,098
Holly, come in.

265
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:43,100
Nevermind.
Come on, let's go.

266
00:22:43,536 --> 00:22:44,972
I know what he meant.

267
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,889
Got enough food,
snacks, power bars?

268
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:50,804
[all] Yes, sir. We got'em.

269
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:53,023
[Madison] Toothpaste,
extra brushes?

270
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:54,677
[Austene] I got'em,
Mr. Madison.

271
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:57,071
So...

272
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:00,204
You can't think of anything
you might've forgotten, huh?

273
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:02,381
[all] No, sir. Nothing.

274
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:04,252
We got it alright this time,
Mr. Madison. Right, guys?

275
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,949
-[all] Yeah.
-I see.

276
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:10,693
Well now...
this could be important,
you know?

277
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:18,048
Especially since
your alternative is
pine cone or tree barks.

278
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:20,094

279
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:22,139
Oh, toilet paper.

280
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:25,578
-There you go, Justin.
-Thanks.

281
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:27,014
-Put this in my bag.
-Cool.

282
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,584
Now, my young Lords
of Tanglewood, go on.

283
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:35,762
-And tell the mountain
hello for me.
-[Justin] Alright!

284
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:38,068

Fill up that for me,
will you?

291
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,694
-You mean now?
-Yeah, that'd be good.

292
00:23:54,824 --> 00:23:57,523
What happened
to the conversation?

293
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,263
Hey, Blaine.

294
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:01,091
-How about a cup of coffee?
-No, thanks.

295
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:03,659
How about a cup
of world-class chili?

296
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,531
No, no. I had some
of that last summer.

297
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:07,054
And?

298
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:08,795
When it gets hot
I still taste it.

and that means less and less.

00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:26,987
Yes.

Sorry, only got
to one cup.

308
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:48,182
Arlen, two years is
enough time for all this.

309
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:52,665
Why, Blaine, whatever
are you talking about?

310
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:54,188
Forget it, Arlen.

311
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,929

you know?

[sighs]

313
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:01,195
Why not I just run
my wife off, too?

314
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:03,850
Then we can get drunk
and sniffle about
our bad luck together.

315
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,981
I didn't run her off!

316
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:11,901

a little more patience...

-If you just understood...
-I did understand!

I understood you were
the best deputy I've ever had

tripping over you.

You're on the slide, Arlen.

And if you don't hoist up
your pantyhose

325

and get your life
back together again,

326
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:47,284
you're gonna lose Austene.

one way or the other,

00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:15,342
Give good news, Williams.

527
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,039
All I want
to hear is good news.

528
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,737
Well, we nearly finish it.

529
00:41:20,173 --> 00:41:22,001
What the hell
does "nearly" mean?

530
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:24,917
There's some kids up there.
School's out.

531
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,962
I should've figured
on that.

532
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:29,487
Well, you let me do
the figure, alright?

533
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:32,533
And there's somebody else
up there, too.

534
00:41:32,664 --> 00:41:34,274
Who?

535
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:37,059
-I don't know.
-What did he look like?

536
00:41:38,017 --> 00:41:39,758
A trapper.

537
00:41:39,888 --> 00:41:41,847
Some kind of hippie
out of the '70s.

538
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:43,675
You know,
leather and stuff.

539
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:47,026
Is that what happened
to your face?

540
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:55,251
Holly and two
of my surveyors quit
when we got back.

541
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:57,819
They say you don't pay'em
enough money
to get busted up.

542
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,517
Is that right?

543
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:01,127
Then just find a few men
who aren't squeamish

544
00:42:01,257 --> 00:42:02,868
about fighting, alright?

545
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:07,002
You know,

546
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:08,743
I don't know
about that trapper guy
but there's no mystery

547
00:42:08,874 --> 00:42:10,179
why those kids
are up there.

548
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:14,314
It's a tree house.
[chuckles]

549
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:18,013
I used to play up there
when I was a kid. It was...

550
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,583
magical.

551
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:25,325
A wonderful place.

552
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:28,546
[chuckles]

553
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:30,548
I have some of my fondest
memories when I...

554
00:42:34,116 --> 00:42:35,683
Just get rid
of the damned thing.

555
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:40,166
OK.

556
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:42,690
[all yelling]

557
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,258
[Logan moaning]

558
00:42:45,388 --> 00:42:46,738
[Brian] Yeah, just go...

559
00:42:48,348 --> 00:42:49,915
[Brian laughing]

560
00:42:51,394 --> 00:42:55,007
[Brian] You're ready?
You're ready?
Here we go!

561
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:56,835
[Lewis] One more.
Let's go, buddy.

562
00:42:59,054 --> 00:43:01,709
Logan, you made it!
You're one of us now.
You're Lord.

563
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,798
[Logan moaning]

564
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:05,321
[Austene] The initiation
is over.

565
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:07,454
[Justin] Come on.

566
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,674
[Austene] He ate 15 sardines
and he drank a chocolate milk.

567
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,200
That's enough.
He doesn't need to toss
his cookies, too.

568
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:17,246
-[Justin] Brian did.
-I had the flu.

569
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:19,640
OK, we need to do this
as the sun sets.

570
00:43:20,815 --> 00:43:22,817
Why do we have to do it
as the sun sets?

571
00:43:22,948 --> 00:43:24,950
We have to do this
at sunset

572
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,995
because that's how
the generations before us
did it.

573
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,650
This is our vow.

574
00:43:30,259 --> 00:43:31,304
You know your part?

575
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:44,143
We, the Lords of Tanglewood...

576
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:52,934
Where the forest
as for centuries did...

577
00:43:56,242 --> 00:43:59,027
[Brian] Cherish our mountain
and all the earth...

578
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:06,382
[Lewis] Love all its creatures
and boundless worth.

579
00:44:11,213 --> 00:44:13,651
As did the ones
who came before...

580
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:18,264
And those will teach
our wood and lore.

581
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:20,005
[bonfire spreads]

582
00:44:22,442 --> 00:44:25,924
We ask you to leave it
pure as found.

583
00:44:26,054 --> 00:44:28,448
We are to it forever bound.

584
00:44:30,232 --> 00:44:33,366
We ask you to leave it
pure as found.

585
00:44:33,496 --> 00:44:36,108
We are to it forever bound.

586
00:44:36,238 --> 00:44:38,719
[all] We are to it
forever bound.

587
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:49,904
[hooting]

588
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:53,299
[hooting]

589
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:10,708
[huffing]

590
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:36,255
[hissing]

591
00:46:01,976 --> 00:46:04,805
[hissing]

592
00:46:06,415 --> 00:46:07,982
[screams]

593
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:12,030
Oh, it's you, Fred.

594
00:46:13,248 --> 00:46:15,381
Austene, Fred's back.

595
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:16,904
I'll be right there.

596
00:46:22,388 --> 00:46:24,956
-Where is he?
-In my sleeping bag.

597
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:30,613
Wow... a snake.

598
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:35,140
I think Fred is OK,
but I don't want him
in my sleeping bag.

599
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,445
Especially when I'm
in there.

600
00:46:36,576 --> 00:46:38,273
He's cold
and you're warm.

601
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:39,797
What did you expect?

602
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:44,149
He's my Freddy,
Freddy, Freddy.

603
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:45,672
Ew...

604
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,153
-Are we going fishing?
-Yeah!

605
00:46:49,502 --> 00:46:52,940
Hey, Austene,
maybe we could use
old Freddy for bait.

606
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:54,376
No way.

607
00:46:54,507 --> 00:46:57,031
[boys laughing]

608
00:46:57,162 --> 00:46:58,598
Hey, you guys just watch.

609
00:46:58,728 --> 00:47:00,905
I'm gonna catch
some fish today.

610
00:47:01,035 --> 00:47:03,298
[soft music]

611
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:13,134
-[Logan] Hey, Rags.
-[Lewis] Rags, what are you
smelling at?

612
00:47:21,142 --> 00:47:22,448
Hey, guys,
I caught another fish!

613
00:47:22,578 --> 00:47:23,928
Another one!

614
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:27,627
We're zip and she's got
seven already.

615
00:47:27,757 --> 00:47:29,150
[laughing]
Yes!

616
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:31,979
She's just showing off.

617
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:37,463
I hate when this happens.
I hate it.

618
00:47:41,336 --> 00:47:43,251
Hey, Austene!
Get your puppy out
of the water!

619
00:47:43,382 --> 00:47:44,992
He's scaring
all the fish!

620
00:47:45,123 --> 00:47:47,081
He's not scaring mine.

621
00:47:47,212 --> 00:47:48,953
Well, that's because
you're over there

622
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:49,954
and he's over here.

623
00:47:50,084 --> 00:47:51,477
Yeah!

624
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:00,355
[whining]

625
00:48:00,486 --> 00:48:02,270
[kids laughing]

626
00:48:04,185 --> 00:48:05,186
[Brian] Alright!

627
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:13,760
-[Justin] I got it!
-[Brian] Guys, my face!

628
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,894
-[Justin] I got it!
-[Lewis] We caught a whale!
Yeah!

629
00:48:22,203 --> 00:48:23,596
[trill]

630
00:48:36,522 --> 00:48:39,394
[all yelling]

631
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:46,314
They'll be playing there
all day.

632
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:47,968
Let's go set the charge.

633
00:48:49,665 --> 00:48:52,233
[laughing, yelling]

634
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:58,239
[ominous music]

635
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:03,462

637
00:49:36,408 --> 00:49:38,410
[Logan screams]

638
00:49:43,415 --> 00:49:45,721
-[Justin] What happened?
-[Logan] I fell on a rock.

639
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:48,594
-[Austene] Let me look at it.
-[Logan] It was like a knife.

640
00:49:48,724 --> 00:49:50,465
[moaning]

641
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:51,858
[screams]
No!

642
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,642
[Lewis] A minor laceration.

643
00:49:53,773 --> 00:49:55,514
Thought it was
far more worse than this.

644
00:49:55,644 --> 00:49:57,429
We gotta get back.

645
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,300
The first aid kit
is in the tree house.

646
00:49:59,431 --> 00:50:02,564
-I'm sorry, you guys.
-It's your first time up here,

647
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:04,610
Mom told me
to take care of you
and look what you do, Logan.

648
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,133
You crash and burn.

649
00:50:06,264 --> 00:50:07,569

00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,746
[kids yelling, arguing]

651
00:50:14,707 --> 00:50:17,797
I don't care!
Get that away from me!

652
00:50:17,927 --> 00:50:20,626
No!

653
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:23,107
Logan.

654
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:28,155
You know, it didn't
really hurt at all.

655
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:31,767
[Logan] Thanks, Austene.

656
00:50:31,898 --> 00:50:33,508
[Justin] Told you
it wouldn't hurt.

657
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:35,162
[Lewis] Listen to her
more often, man.

658
00:50:36,642 --> 00:50:37,730
[Justin] You OK?

659
00:50:41,864 --> 00:50:43,779
Does anybody want
to help me clean the fish?

660
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:49,133
I gotta go find
some firewood.

661
00:50:50,743 --> 00:50:52,919
I'm gonna go help him.

662
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,400
I gotta go find a tree
and take care
of my business.

663
00:50:56,531 --> 00:51:00,057
I gotta go make a fire
with the... firewood.

664
00:51:01,406 --> 00:51:02,494
Wimps.
Come on, Rags.

665
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:12,504
[beeping]

666
00:51:33,525 --> 00:51:35,614
Well, well, well.

667
00:51:36,528 --> 00:51:39,574
The miracles never cease
to happen.

668
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:42,229
I'm glad you realize that.

669
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,796
Huh.

670
00:51:43,926 --> 00:51:46,233
I was hopping for this.

671
00:51:47,843 --> 00:51:49,280
I told you to get off
the mountain.

672
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:50,716
Yeah, you did.

673
00:51:51,847 --> 00:51:55,416

00:52:33,846 --> 00:52:35,543
Oh...

680
00:52:37,284 --> 00:52:39,634
[Williams] You're really
slippery, aren't you?

681
00:52:39,765 --> 00:52:40,940
Well, fight this!

682
00:52:46,685 --> 00:52:48,513
-[Brian] A gunshot!
-[Justin] Austene!

683
00:52:48,643 --> 00:52:50,341
Come on! They're the same guys.
We'll call the rangers.

684
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:52,604
I can't right now.

685
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:54,693
Austene, what are you
waiting for? Come on!

686
00:52:54,823 --> 00:52:57,739
I have to put the fish away
or Rags will eat them.

687
00:52:57,870 --> 00:52:59,611
OK, well just catch up
with the thing, alright?

688
00:52:59,741 --> 00:53:00,742
[Lewis] And hurry!

689
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:10,187

Stay here, Rags.

-Sounds like an explosion.
-Where did it come from?

697
00:54:18,124 --> 00:54:19,560
Sounds like
the tree house.

698
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:21,867
[Lewis and Justin] Austene!

699
00:54:34,662 --> 00:54:37,274
[cub whining]

700
00:54:58,643 --> 00:55:00,819
Austene! She must
be in there!

701
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:02,734
[Justin and Lewis] No!

702
00:55:02,864 --> 00:55:04,083
[Brian] No!

703
00:55:05,214 --> 00:55:06,607
Austene!

704
00:55:06,738 --> 00:55:08,348
Austene! Austene!

705
00:55:09,784 --> 00:55:11,351
Austene! Austene!

706
00:55:13,745 --> 00:55:16,313
Protective spirit, huh?
Protective spirit?

707
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:18,097
[Brian] What good does it do
to believe in anything?

708
00:55:18,227 --> 00:55:20,012
Justin, we gotta get
some help.

709
00:55:20,142 --> 00:55:21,753
Somebody's gotta help us.

710
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:24,059
Somebody's gotta help us!
Listen to me!

711
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,105
Where was he
when we really need him, huh?
Where was he?

712
00:55:26,235 --> 00:55:28,194
[Lewis] Calm down
and listen to me!

713
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,892
[Justin] OK! Guys, shut up!
Everybody just shut up!

714
00:55:31,023 --> 00:55:32,764
-[sobbing]
-[Justin] Alright.

715
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:34,940
Listen to me, guys.

716
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:37,377
We gotta get
some help, OK?
Let's go! Let's go!

717
00:55:37,508 --> 00:55:39,597
[Lewis] Let's go. We'll go
get some help. Come on!

718
00:55:39,727 --> 00:55:41,338
[Brian] No!
We need to find her!

719
00:55:45,951 --> 00:55:47,605
[guys shouting]

720
00:55:58,267 --> 00:55:59,704
[Lewis] Go! Go! Go!

721
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:27,775
Clovis.

722
00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:29,777
[panting]

723
00:56:34,913 --> 00:56:36,523
[Justin] Hey, Mr. Madison!

724
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,052
[Brian] Mr. Madison!

725
00:56:49,275 --> 00:56:51,669
[kids shouting
at the same time]

726
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:53,235
[Madison] Calm down!
Calm down!

727
00:56:53,366 --> 00:56:56,195
[kids shouting]

728
00:56:56,325 --> 00:56:59,067
-[Arlen] Austen what?
-[kids shouting]

729
00:56:59,198 --> 00:57:01,026
[Arlen] Come on,
get on the Bronco.
Let's go!

730
00:57:01,156 --> 00:57:02,549
We'll find Austene.
Let's go!

731
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,727
Clovis, call sheriff Ramsey.

732
00:57:08,033 --> 00:57:10,165
And the fire sergeant.
Tell him it might be a fire.

733
00:57:20,785 --> 00:57:22,003
Give me the sheriff.

734
00:57:34,146 --> 00:57:37,628
[roaring]

735
00:57:40,892 --> 00:57:42,850
[twinkling]

736
00:57:54,775 --> 00:57:57,125
[bear huffing]

737
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:06,874
How are you feeling,
Austene?

738
00:58:08,354 --> 00:58:09,616
Where am I?

739
00:58:12,097 --> 00:58:13,141
Was I sleeping?

740
00:58:14,229 --> 00:58:16,144
Yes, you were sleeping.

741
00:58:19,104 --> 00:58:20,148
Rags, where is he?

742
00:58:21,236 --> 00:58:22,194
Over there.

743
00:58:33,074 --> 00:58:34,162
What happened?

744
00:58:35,294 --> 00:58:37,035
Where are all the others?

745
00:58:37,165 --> 00:58:38,166
Your friends are fine.

746
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:48,612
This is your home?

747
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:51,310
Is this where you live?

748
00:58:52,441 --> 00:58:54,095
The forest is my home.

749
00:58:55,227 --> 00:58:56,271
Are you the...?

750
00:58:57,185 --> 00:59:01,712
Have you lived here
a long, long time?

751
00:59:04,497 --> 00:59:06,194
A long, long time.

752
00:59:15,943 --> 00:59:18,032
I'm really sorry
you never saw
your wife again.

753
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:21,819
Sleep.

754
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:24,256
Everything will be fine.

755
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:28,956
[Blaine] Arlen, calm down.

756
00:59:31,872 --> 00:59:33,570
[Arlen grunting]

757
00:59:35,267 --> 00:59:37,095
Arlen, come here.

758
00:59:37,225 --> 00:59:38,966
Come here.
You gotta calm down.

759
00:59:39,097 --> 00:59:41,186
She's not here, Blaine!
She wasn't here!

760
00:59:41,316 --> 00:59:44,058
If she... was here,
we would've found her.

761
00:59:44,189 --> 00:59:46,060
-Alright, alright!
-We'd found her, wouldn't we?

762
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,803
[Arlen sobbing]

763
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:52,240
Why don't you just beat
the hell out of me?

764
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:53,764
[crying]

765
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:56,027
It wouldn't do any good.

766
00:59:57,419 --> 00:59:58,725
Nothing would feel
like it.

767
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:00,771
Come on.

768
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:04,252
[Blaine] Clovis,
come over here.

769
01:00:21,313 --> 01:00:23,358
Oh, God!

770
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:26,013
God, help me!

771
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:30,931
What would I give...

772
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,718
Oh, Austene...

773
01:00:34,848 --> 01:00:36,154
Daddy?

774
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:42,247
My baby!

775
01:00:42,377 --> 01:00:44,118
My baby!

776
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:49,733
Guys, it's Austene!

777
01:00:51,386 --> 01:00:52,649
-[Lewis] Oh, gosh!
-[Justin] She's OK!

778
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:56,870
[Arlen] Oh, thanks!

779
01:00:57,001 --> 01:01:00,004
[sobbing]
My baby! My baby!

780
01:01:02,528 --> 01:01:04,835
I love you so much.

781
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:07,838
I love you, Austene.

782
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:11,015
Austene, I'm so sorry.

783
01:01:11,145 --> 01:01:13,844
I'm so sorry for everything.
Please, forgive me.

784
01:01:13,974 --> 01:01:16,063
Daddy, it's fine.

785
01:01:16,194 --> 01:01:18,152
I love you, baby!

786
01:01:19,197 --> 01:01:20,894
[eagle screeches]

787
01:01:24,115 --> 01:01:25,203
Still on the job, huh?

788
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:30,121
-What was that?
-I was just saying thank you.

789
01:01:33,385 --> 01:01:34,908
[screech]

790
01:01:40,348 --> 01:01:41,785
To the spirit
of the mountain?

791
01:01:41,915 --> 01:01:43,047
[chuckles]

792
01:01:45,353 --> 01:01:48,835
You don't still believe
on those old stories,
do you?

793
01:02:02,066 --> 01:02:04,024
[Arlen] What happened
on the mountain, Blaine?

794
01:02:04,155 --> 01:02:06,026
You saw it.

795
01:02:06,157 --> 01:02:08,637
How could anything
would've live through that?

796
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:12,076
I told you, Daddy.
My friend helped me.

797
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:16,950
You know, odd things have been
happening on that mountain
for a long time.

798
01:02:20,127 --> 01:02:21,825
It's not haunted,
I know that.

799
01:02:21,955 --> 01:02:24,392
[pouring coffee]

800
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:27,004
Enchanted, maybe.

801
01:02:27,134 --> 01:02:28,527
Enchanted?

802
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:36,230
What happened to you
up there today

803
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:38,319
it reminds me of something
that happened...

804
01:02:40,669 --> 01:02:41,932
30 years ago.

805
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:46,763
I took my wife out canoing 
in the moonlight.

806
01:02:46,893 --> 01:02:50,549
And it got breezy 
and it got chilly.

807
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:53,073
And I wanted to move 
to the front and put 
my jacket around her.

808
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:55,641
And I took a wrong step, 
I shifted my weight

809
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,251
and the canoe turned upside.

810
01:02:59,471 --> 01:03:01,778
I thought I could 
hear her screaming,

811
01:03:01,908 --> 01:03:04,041
but before I could get 
to her, she went under.

812
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:06,783
So I dove.

813
01:03:08,132 --> 01:03:11,178
And I dove and I dove,

814
01:03:11,309 --> 01:03:12,484
but I couldn't find her.

815
01:03:14,747 --> 01:03:17,271
I didn't know what else 
to do so I ran for help.

816
01:03:19,578 --> 01:03:20,884
When I got back,

817
01:03:22,755 --> 01:03:25,584
she was there.

818
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:28,935
Cold and wet, 
and waiting for me.

819
01:03:31,372 --> 01:03:33,331
Something had lifted
her up, she said.

820
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:39,380
Something embraced her
and carried her
to the surface.

821
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:41,034
And she wasn't afraid,

822
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:44,385
and she knew
I was coming back.

823
01:03:44,516 --> 01:03:45,952
How do you explain that?

824
01:03:49,738 --> 01:03:51,828
Some things
you can't explain.

825
01:03:52,785 --> 01:03:54,526
I know what I believe,

826
01:03:54,656 --> 01:03:56,267
and you might not agree.

827
01:03:58,965 --> 01:04:01,272
But I'm thankful
for the way things worked out.

828
01:04:03,535 --> 01:04:05,189
And you should be, too.

829
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:06,843
[rumbling]

830
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:11,412
What the heck?

831
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:15,982
[ominous music]

832
01:04:24,686 --> 01:04:27,646
Thorne is on the move.
He managed to get
a temporary permit.

833
01:04:27,776 --> 01:04:29,213
He can start cutting
the trees at noon tomorrow.

834
01:04:29,343 --> 01:04:30,649
[Arlen] What?

835
01:04:30,779 --> 01:04:32,433
We were supposed
to vote on this.

836
01:04:32,564 --> 01:04:34,131
We gotta get a court order.

837
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:36,481
This might help.
I gotta call this morning

838
01:04:36,611 --> 01:04:38,962
from someone who saw
one of Thorne's crew
loading explosives.

839
01:04:39,092 --> 01:04:42,269
You mean... Thorne could be
responsible for blowing up
the tree house?

840
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,184
Everything points
at Thorne.

841
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:46,491
Whoa, whoa.

842
01:05:00,331 --> 01:05:02,202
Justin, hey.

843
01:05:07,729 --> 01:05:09,688
Austene, what are you
doing here?

844
01:05:09,818 --> 01:05:12,343
We have some emergency
planning to do.

845
01:05:12,473 --> 01:05:15,085
I know the sheriff
and the grown ups
are gonna do all they can,

846
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:16,782
but we can't just
wait around.

847
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,437
Right, after what they did
to our tree house, guys.

848
01:05:19,567 --> 01:05:21,961
If we're gonna put
our plan into action,
we gotta move fast.

849
01:05:22,092 --> 01:05:23,702
Hold on.

850
01:05:23,832 --> 01:05:25,356
We got a little problem
with our plan.

851
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:27,401
What?

852
01:05:27,532 --> 01:05:29,142
Communications.

853
01:05:29,273 --> 01:05:31,275
They have CBs
and walkie-talkies.

854
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:35,366
I might have something.

855
01:05:36,802 --> 01:05:39,239
[cheering]

856
01:05:47,334 --> 01:05:50,207
[whirring]

857
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:01,435
-[Thorne] Everyone of
the crew teams have a radio?
-[Williams] Yes, sir.

858
01:06:01,566 --> 01:06:02,741
And they're all
in the same frequency?

859
01:06:02,871 --> 01:06:04,656
I checked them
all myself.

860
01:06:04,786 --> 01:06:06,353
You'll make absolutely clear
that nothing and no one

861
01:06:06,484 --> 01:06:08,399
makes a move without
a direct order from me.

862
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:10,618
Yes, Mr. Thorne, I guarantee
nothing's gonna go wrong.

863
01:06:10,749 --> 01:06:12,577
I'll remember you said that.

864
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:15,362
Buster, get that truck
loaded up and follow us.

865
01:06:15,493 --> 01:06:17,277
We're taking
the back road.

866
01:06:17,408 --> 01:06:19,410
Travis, why is it necessary
for us to go?

867
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,541
We don't belong up there.

868
01:06:21,499 --> 01:06:24,241
He's right, Travis.
We're big city attorneys.

869
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:26,330
We're not backwoods lawyers.

870
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:28,332
I'm sorry, gentleman.
I really am.

871
01:06:28,462 --> 01:06:31,074
Are you two certain
that those permits
are in order?

872
01:06:31,857 --> 01:06:33,598
Well, yeah, sure.
But this is...

873
01:06:33,728 --> 01:06:35,469
Then get your petty
butts on board!

874
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,602
We got 72 hours to cut
everything we can

875
01:06:37,732 --> 01:06:39,256
and get the heck out!
So get in!

876
01:06:39,386 --> 01:06:41,258
Go! Move out!

877
01:06:44,957 --> 01:06:46,698
Get in.
Move out.

878
01:06:52,878 --> 01:06:54,314
This is it.
Let's do it.

879
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,888
-Alright. You got the tapes
and the walkie?
-Yes.

880
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:05,847
Alright. Then walk to the top
of the hill and you'll be
between Thorne and his men.

881
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:08,111
-You ready?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

882
01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:09,155
Go.

883
01:07:09,982 --> 01:07:10,809
Alright, guys.

884
01:07:10,939 --> 01:07:13,464
One, two,

885
01:07:13,594 --> 01:07:14,639

886
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:40,404
Right there.

887
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:37,504
[whispering]
Guys, they're coming!

888
01:08:37,635 --> 01:08:39,376
Let's go.

889
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:48,820
-You guys ready?
-[both] Yeah.

890
01:08:57,698 --> 01:08:59,352
[Thorne] Alright, every out!

just move it!

892
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:05,706
Hustle! Hustle Hustle!
We gotta move this log.

893
01:09:05,837 --> 01:09:07,404
Get this chunk of kindling
off the road.

894
01:09:07,534 --> 01:09:09,449
And you two,
come on, out of the car.

895
01:09:12,974 --> 01:09:14,367
You know what, gentleman?

896
01:09:16,587 --> 01:09:18,328
I think somebody's trying
to pull my chain.

in the log there, Mr. Thorne.

903
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,302
Get it.

904
01:09:37,608 --> 01:09:39,523
[Thorne] They're out there.

905
01:09:39,653 --> 01:09:40,828
I know they are.

906
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:45,833
Continue,
Mr. Williams.

907
01:09:46,747 --> 01:09:48,445
Do it again.

908
01:09:48,575 --> 01:09:50,577
Come on, you can take care
of your boo-boo

909
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:52,666
when we get back.
Let's go! Lift it up.
Come on, girls.

910
01:09:58,019 --> 01:09:59,543
Yes!

911
01:10:05,723 --> 01:10:08,247
[Thorne] I know
you're out there. Huh?

912
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,467
You little green weenies.

913
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,427
Environmentalists?

914
01:10:17,256 --> 01:10:20,999
Are you afraid
to show your face,
is that what it is? Huh?

915
01:10:21,129 --> 01:10:22,479
Well, it's not gonna work.

916
01:10:22,609 --> 01:10:24,959
I don't need
to see your face.

917
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:26,831
Because I know
you're out there.

918
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:29,399
[Williams] Put your backs
into it, girls! Come on!

919
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:33,881
[Thorne] I know your game.

920
01:10:34,012 --> 01:10:35,753
Nothing new to me.
You're afraid, right?

921
01:10:39,409 --> 01:10:42,847

like the cowardly
little fairies you are.

922
01:10:46,024 --> 01:10:48,374
-Mr. Thorne!
-Not now, Buster. Huh?

923
01:10:49,984 --> 01:10:51,899
And I'm tired
of your nonsenses.

924
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:54,685
Now, you might try
to slow me down, dear,

925
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,123
but you will never stop me.

926
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,777
Mr. Thorne, the antennae.

927
01:10:59,907 --> 01:11:01,953
You understand? Never!

928
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:04,782
Mr. Williams.

929
01:11:04,912 --> 01:11:08,089
You will never stop
Travis Thorne!

930
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:10,701
And no...! Never sneak up
on me like that.

Alright, everybody,

932
01:11:12,137 --> 01:11:13,704
-Mr. Thorne.
-I said now.

933
01:11:13,834 --> 01:11:15,880
Right? Not tomorrow.
Not next week.

934
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:17,577
-Now!
-Yes, sure, Mr. Thorne.

935
01:11:17,708 --> 01:11:19,100
[Williams] Come on, Buster.

936
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:20,928
What, am I surrounded
by morons or something?

937
01:11:21,059 --> 01:11:22,495
Just get in the car!

938
01:11:23,714 --> 01:11:25,716

I finally caught
one bigger than you.

Won't start.

941
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:41,558
It's a brilliant observation,
Mr. Williams.

942
01:11:43,037 --> 01:11:44,865
It's probably just
flooded out.

943
01:11:44,996 --> 01:11:46,389
I'll get it.

Oh, no.

950
01:12:44,925 --> 01:12:46,057
Time for plan 2.

951
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:49,843
Just look what they put
into the tailpipes.

952
01:12:50,931 --> 01:12:51,976
A potato!

953
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:54,848
-A potato?
-Yeah.

954
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:56,589
I got two of them.

955

One potato,

01:12:59,331 --> 01:13:00,941
two potatoes.

957
01:13:01,072 --> 01:13:02,116

You want one?

958

What? Do I want one?

959

You are one of them,
aren't you?
You're a green weenie!

963

They have penetrated.

964
01:13:19,307 --> 01:13:20,831
Mr. Thorne,
it's not his fault!

I just wanna strangle him!

feel better. Alright?
-Alright.

01:30:29,467 --> 01:30:30,686
I know I'm gonna have
to spend some time,

1228
01:30:30,816 --> 01:30:32,078
but it really doesn't matter.

1229
01:30:35,908 --> 01:30:38,868
[giggles]
I'm so happy I could sing.
I love this land!

1230
01:30:38,998 --> 01:30:41,784
From the rainwood forest
I feel love just
flowing through me.

1231
01:30:41,914 --> 01:30:43,742
Hi. I've been reborn.

1232
01:30:43,873 --> 01:30:45,744
You never seen a bear
that talks, did you? Ever?

1233
01:30:45,875 --> 01:30:48,051
[chuckles]
I don't know,
I love these trees.

1234
01:30:48,181 --> 01:30:51,620
Don't put me
in the cell with the rest.
They're crazy. Please!

-[guys] Yes! Yes!

1237
01:31:04,850 --> 01:31:06,461
I'd like you to wear
this again, Arlen.

1238
01:31:07,984 --> 01:31:09,202
If you feel
you're ready for it.

1239
01:31:11,727 --> 01:31:12,815
[Madison] Yeah, alright.

1240
01:31:12,945 --> 01:31:14,512
I'd like that, Blaine.

1241
01:31:20,170 --> 01:31:21,954
[Madison] Tell me what?
Tell me what?

1242
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:25,784
Thanks.

1243
01:31:30,789 --> 01:31:32,008

on you, Daddy.

01:32:20,883 --> 01:32:22,667
-You know, it's kinda cool.
-Yeah!

1253
01:32:31,284 --> 01:32:32,982
[Lewis] Hey,
