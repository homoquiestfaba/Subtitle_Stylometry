I don't want
his fucking car.

I never wanna see
that sick fuck again.

516
00:34:13,332 --> 00:34:16,432

After all he's done for you!

00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,466
And where are you gonna
go, Jennifer?

519
00:34:20,532 --> 00:34:22,567
- You don't have anywhere
- Yes, I do!

520
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:24,899
Yes, I do, Mom.

521
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:26,766
Oh, Jen.

522
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:27,900
Jen, I may be dumb,

523
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,265
but you're a smart girl.
Don't kid yourself.

524
00:34:30,332 --> 00:34:31,999
Like I'm passing up
a great gig here?

525
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:34,032
There are things about your
father that you don't know.

526
00:34:34,098 --> 00:34:35,233
Oh, God,
here we go again,

527

are you kidding me?
Are you kidding?

528
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:38,834
[Patty] It's not
that he's a con man

529
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:41,600
- or a swindler.
- Mom, this is your shit!

530
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:43,667
It's nothing to do with
my relationship with him!

531
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:46,301
- ...he believes his own lies!
- [gasps]

532
00:34:46,368 --> 00:34:47,967
Okay, let's talk about
believing your own lies,

shall we?

534
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:51,634
Let's talk about
protecting your children!

535

It's your one fucking
job to protect me!

536
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:58,501
Listen to me,
your father is a liar.

537
00:34:58,568 --> 00:35:00,468
- He's a liar.
- Shut up! Please, shut up!

Look, I know what I
am, he doesn't.

539
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,334
And if you're gonna
go with him,

540
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:05,768
pretty soon,
you won't either.

541
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:08,336
- You won't.
- I'm done. I'm done.

I'm done!
I'm done! [crying]

Your father is a liar.

anymore!

Stop! Stop!

547
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,970
- Don't touch me!
- Listen to me, Jennifer!

548
00:35:22,034 --> 00:35:23,501
He looks you
square in the eyes

549
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:25,367
and he shows
you his heart,

550
00:35:25,435 --> 00:35:28,103
- and it is a lie!
- Get out of my way!

551

691
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,728
Can we finish
our conversation?

692
00:45:44,794 --> 00:45:47,395
Jennifer, whatever it was
that you think you saw,

693
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:49,493
or you saw,
or you think you're alleging...

694
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,628
Dad, I just think we should
be straight with each other.

695
00:45:54,227 --> 00:45:55,894
We should tell
each other the truth.

696
00:45:57,561 --> 00:45:58,929
I told you the truth.

697
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:12,562
[John] Okay.

698
00:46:14,061 --> 00:46:15,895
I've got
some problems.

699
00:46:16,694 --> 00:46:19,127
Not drug problems.
Not drugs.

700
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:21,295
Um, business.

701
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,329
And I owe some people
some money,

702
00:46:25,395 --> 00:46:26,829
some big mistakes
I made.

703
00:46:33,196 --> 00:46:34,897
Thank you
for telling me.

704
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:39,830
I don't want
to be a burden.

705
00:46:41,162 --> 00:46:42,596
[John sighs]

706
00:46:43,229 --> 00:46:44,763
It's not a burden.

707
00:46:47,029 --> 00:46:49,863
Like I've been saying,
it's a fresh start.

708
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,764
Let's get you
whipped into shape.

709
00:46:58,197 --> 00:47:00,231
No more darkness!

- No more hiding

711
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:04,364
- from beautiful things.
- Whoa, whoa!

712
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,664
You know, Dad,
these people you owe money to, Dad,

713
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:09,030
you can just tell them
you're getting a new job.

714
00:47:09,097 --> 00:47:10,565
A fresh start.

715
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,631

Well, I shaved
a couple years off.

723
00:47:28,364 --> 00:47:30,664
I thought
we were being honest.

724
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,698
Also, you're listing way
too many areas of expertise.

725
00:47:33,766 --> 00:47:35,399
It's a resume, Jennifer.

726
00:47:35,465 --> 00:47:37,565
They expect you
to lie on a resume.

727
00:47:37,632 --> 00:47:39,865
Everybody lies on a
resume, they factor it in.

728

Oh, don't go too short
on the top,

[instrumental music playing]

All right now,
the pay is okay slash not great.

It's $2.50 an hour,

raise up to $3.50 after
the first six months.

734
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:05,700
That's great.
It works for me.

Sir, hi. Can I have a
moment of your time? Okay.

736

Hello. Hi.
My name's Jennifer. Okay.

737
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,900
- Great.
- Yeah, absolutely.

738
00:48:16,967 --> 00:48:19,267
Thank you for supporting such
a great cause, that's awesome.

[indistinct chatter]

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

00:48:50,435 --> 00:48:53,003
- [Jennifer] You did?
- Yeah.

745
00:48:53,068 --> 00:48:55,334
You're looking at the
new executive manager

746
00:48:55,401 --> 00:48:57,168
for Sailfeather
Floatplanes.

747
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:59,567
- Dad, that's fantastic.
- Yeah.

748
00:48:59,634 --> 00:49:01,667
Well, it's a long way
out of town.

749
00:49:01,734 --> 00:49:03,935
A managerial
position, sure.

750
00:49:04,002 --> 00:49:06,469
And they made me lay out
for a fancy new briefcase.

751
00:49:08,734 --> 00:49:09,936
But it's a job.

752
00:49:11,035 --> 00:49:12,202
We should celebrate.

753
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:14,468
Yeah.

754
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,369
There's a sensitive
topic I've got to raise.

755
00:49:17,068 --> 00:49:18,401
I come home
from work

756
00:49:18,468 --> 00:49:19,769
and I have
a little stress.

757
00:49:21,436 --> 00:49:23,602
And I wind down...
We've covered this.

Thai stick

on my dresser.

And I went to my
little carved canoe...

00:49:34,636 --> 00:49:36,537
Jennifer, have you
touched my stash?

762
00:49:37,969 --> 00:49:39,671
- Yes.
- Yes?

763
00:49:39,736 --> 00:49:41,603
I'm sorry,
I didn't think you would notice.

764
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,871
Okay, calling
a house meeting.

765
00:49:43,937 --> 00:49:48,403
Rule number one,
you stay away from my stash. Agreed?

766
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,704
- Agreed.
- Rule number two,

767
00:49:49,771 --> 00:49:52,071
you can smoke,
but do it behind my back.

768
00:49:52,137 --> 00:49:53,704
Or we could
smoke together?

769
00:49:53,771 --> 00:49:57,137
Don't you understand the
concept of boundaries?

770
00:49:57,204 --> 00:49:59,371
Look, Jennifer,
don't disappoint me.

771

world all day.

I get home,
I wanna know I've got my weed.

774
00:50:08,737 --> 00:50:09,971
Agreed?

775
00:50:10,038 --> 00:50:11,437
Agreed.

776
00:50:11,504 --> 00:50:12,972
Okay, this one's
not a rule,

777
00:50:13,037 --> 00:50:17,503
but just consider changing
your hair color back.

778

I'm going to bed.

You bought
yourself a car?

Something like that,

785
00:51:07,373 --> 00:51:09,407
I dropped 400 bucks to
see how long it'll last.

786
00:51:11,141 --> 00:51:12,241
How was work?

787
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:14,540
You're home
kinda early.

788
00:51:14,607 --> 00:51:17,607
You know, I wanna
show you something.

789
00:51:18,173 --> 00:51:19,575
Sit yourself down.

790
00:51:29,974 --> 00:51:30,774
What's that?

791
00:51:32,142 --> 00:51:33,375
Uh...

792
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,074
It's a jean stretcher.

793
00:51:35,141 --> 00:51:37,075
It makes
jeans longer.

794
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:38,541
- Really?
- Yeah.

795
00:51:38,609 --> 00:51:40,409
Well, you know how my
jeans are always too short,

796
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:41,975
but they're fine
when I buy them.

797
00:51:42,042 --> 00:51:43,642
It's just when I put them in the
wash, they shrink,

798
00:51:43,709 --> 00:51:45,876
and millions of people
have that problem.

799
00:51:46,275 --> 00:51:47,576
Observe.

800
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:52,910
See how that works?

801
00:51:55,108 --> 00:51:58,042
See? $12.95 for one

802
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:00,676
and $25 for two.

803
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:03,209
- That sound fair to you?
- Sure.

804
00:52:03,275 --> 00:52:05,877
Let me show you the art.
It's for the ad.

805
00:52:05,943 --> 00:52:08,209
I've already paid for it to
run in the paper next week,

806
00:52:08,276 --> 00:52:10,176
but I've gotta check
my pennies in the piggy.

807
00:52:10,241 --> 00:52:11,709
[Jennifer] It's great.

808
00:52:11,775 --> 00:52:13,043
It's a great thing to have
alongside the day job.

809
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:15,509
Exactly, snicklefritz.

810

with the whole big raft.

Now, don't go
anywhere,

there's a lot more
I wanna tell ya.

813
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,910
I had a couple of
other opportunities.

814
00:52:30,376 --> 00:52:31,944
I got offered
a couple other jobs,

815
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:33,945
even better money,
but they're all labor.

816
00:52:37,543 --> 00:52:38,912
I could never
do that.

817
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,244

[chuckling]
You idiot.

864
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:10,559
- Do you remember that?
- [voice quivers] Yeah.

865
00:58:11,156 --> 00:58:12,458
[sniffles]

866
00:58:15,357 --> 00:58:16,824
[Jennifer] You told me
to describe the cowboy

867
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:19,257
while you sketched
with your back to him.

868
00:58:19,925 --> 00:58:21,358
You said that

869
00:58:21,425 --> 00:58:23,457
if you describe
something well enough,

870
00:58:23,525 --> 00:58:25,226
anyone can see it.

871
00:58:26,757 --> 00:58:28,724
Sorry about...

872
00:58:30,593 --> 00:58:33,693
- It's okay, Dad.
- No, it's not okay.

873
00:58:33,757 --> 00:58:36,725
[sniffles] It's not okay.
It's not okay.

874
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,592
I appreciate...

875
00:58:41,926 --> 00:58:43,259
so much.

876
00:58:44,392 --> 00:58:46,459
What you did, I mean,

877
00:58:46,526 --> 00:58:49,292
all of this
that you did for me.

878
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,560
It's...

879
00:58:51,093 --> 00:58:52,427
[sighs]

880
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,927
And I just so want
you to know...

881
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:00,893
[sniffles]

882
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,693
...for you, baby,
I'd climb any mountain.

883
00:59:06,893 --> 00:59:10,826
And no matter what happens,
I'm gonna be there.

884
00:59:10,893 --> 00:59:12,360
No matter.

885
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:15,160
The whole fucking
world could explode

886
00:59:15,227 --> 00:59:16,893
and I will be
here for you.

887
00:59:16,959 --> 00:59:18,894
- I know.

Do ya?

890
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,194
Yes, Dad.

891
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,727
[John] Thank God.

892
00:59:29,059 --> 00:59:31,728
Oh, my darling
baby girl.

[Jennifer] <i>Things are
really good here, Nick.</i>

895
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,462
<i>Dad seems to actually
be changing.</i>

896
00:59:47,929 --> 00:59:49,663
<i>He's been more
honest with me</i>

897
00:59:49,729 --> 00:59:51,395

willing to work</i>

905
01:00:55,465 --> 01:00:58,165
[John] You...
You colored your hair.

906
01:00:58,232 --> 01:00:59,731
I colored my hair?

907
01:01:02,864 --> 01:01:05,098
I haven't changed my clothes
in three fucking days

908
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:07,299
because the cops wouldn't
let me back in the house.

909
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:12,598
Can I... Can I get
a cigarette, man?

910
01:01:16,231 --> 01:01:17,565
[guard] Here you go.

911
01:01:25,032 --> 01:01:26,233
Thank you.

912
01:01:28,897 --> 01:01:32,365
I was reading recently
in <i>Reader's Digest...</i>

913
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:38,531
about the power of
the subconscious mind

914
01:01:38,598 --> 01:01:41,934
and how our actions are
not consciously willed,

915
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,699
but are what our inner beings
secretly divine for us.

916
01:01:48,766 --> 01:01:50,466
Some people think
it's the gods.

917
01:01:50,533 --> 01:01:53,200
I think you make
your bed,

918
01:01:53,267 --> 01:01:54,367
or your mind
makes your bed.

919
01:01:54,433 --> 01:01:55,568
What's that
on your forehead?

920
01:01:56,567 --> 01:01:57,901
- What is that?
- Nothing. Nothing.

921
01:01:59,433 --> 01:02:01,068
What do you mean
it's nothing?

922
01:02:01,135 --> 01:02:02,300
I see it,
it's right there.

923
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:04,334
Well, I cut myself.

924
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:05,634
What are you
talking about?

925
01:02:05,701 --> 01:02:07,201
- It's not even a cut.
- [John] Yeah.

926
01:02:07,267 --> 01:02:08,599
What is it?

927
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:10,468
- [John sputters]
- What happened?

928
01:02:10,534 --> 01:02:12,667
- Jennifer...
- It's red raw,

929
01:02:12,734 --> 01:02:13,767
it's a huge welt!

930
01:02:14,933 --> 01:02:17,500
Dad, this is important.

931
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,300
When did you decide
to do this?

932
01:02:19,367 --> 01:02:21,802
Jen, I... [sputters]
Listen. I've been asked

933
01:02:21,869 --> 01:02:23,801
a lot of questions lately
and I'm a little...

934
01:02:23,867 --> 01:02:26,234
- Shut up!
- I've been getting asked

935
01:02:26,301 --> 01:02:28,135
a lot of questions
lately, Jen!

936
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,468
Then answer mine!

937
01:02:29,533 --> 01:02:30,867
- [guard] Hey, cool it!
- [John] It's okay.

938
01:02:31,701 --> 01:02:33,802
[sniffles]
I'm a little tired.

939
01:02:37,068 --> 01:02:38,436
Oh.

940
01:02:39,269 --> 01:02:41,035
You're tired?

941
01:02:41,102 --> 01:02:44,401
[yelling] You're tired?
Are you fucking kidding me?

942
01:02:44,468 --> 01:02:46,002
Okay, okay. Come on.
It's okay, it's okay!

943
01:02:46,068 --> 01:02:48,301
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No, no, no, no!

944
01:02:48,368 --> 01:02:49,501
- Come on, baby!
- [guard] That's it.

945
01:02:49,568 --> 01:02:51,436
Just one more second,
I promise.

946
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,969
Answer the fucking
question,

947
01:02:55,036 --> 01:02:56,603
just tell me
the truth!

948
01:02:56,670 --> 01:03:00,337
You're only interested in
what the cops' story is.

949
01:03:00,403 --> 01:03:02,469
You don't even
wanna hear mine.

950
01:03:02,535 --> 01:03:04,135
- Dad...
- I'm guilty until proven innocent.

951
01:03:04,203 --> 01:03:06,469
I don't have
any rights, do I?

952
01:03:06,536 --> 01:03:09,102
Do I? Do I?
I've got a cop standing right here.

953
01:03:09,169 --> 01:03:10,869
- I've been in a fucking...
- [Jennifer] They caught you

954
01:03:10,936 --> 01:03:12,703
- with the money in the car.
- Huh?

955
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:15,303
You had a gun,
you have a fucking huge welt

956
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:16,803
- where you glued on a wig!
- I...

957
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:19,237
Look, you know,
I'm at a disadvantage.

958
01:03:19,303 --> 01:03:21,238
I can't see what
you're talking about.

959
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:23,871
[softly] My God.

960
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:28,904
[John sighs,
sniffles]

961
01:03:35,403 --> 01:03:37,871
I need to know when
you decided to do this.

962
01:03:41,837 --> 01:03:43,971
[sobbing] I'm not lying to
you, Jennifer.

963
01:03:44,038 --> 01:03:47,372
It... It just is
more complicated

964
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:49,638
- than that, come on.
- So, you're innocent?

965
01:03:51,138 --> 01:03:53,305
You don't... [sputters]

966
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:54,970
You don't get it yet,

967
01:03:55,038 --> 01:03:57,804
you're gonna get it when
you walk a mile in my shoes.

968
01:03:57,871 --> 01:03:59,871
You're gonna
understand, trust me.

969
01:03:59,938 --> 01:04:02,404
You're gonna understand one
day when you walk a mile...

970
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:05,338
You will never fucking change!
[sobs]

971
01:04:05,405 --> 01:04:07,005

- Come on, that's enough.

01:20:00,112 --> 01:20:01,578
Let me just
grab my purse.

1200
01:20:01,644 --> 01:20:04,378
Oh, I've got money.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1201
01:20:04,443 --> 01:20:07,311
- I mean, I just...
- Okay. Oh, sure.

1202
01:20:07,377 --> 01:20:09,211
Sure, I'll wait here.

1203
01:20:09,278 --> 01:20:10,744
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

1204
01:20:17,077 --> 01:20:18,646
[Jennifer] Dad...

1205
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:20,445
I didn't know
you were getting out.

1206
01:20:22,377 --> 01:20:23,879
Did you tell anyone?

1207
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:26,411
Did anybody
pick you up?

1208
01:20:28,878 --> 01:20:31,945
The truth is,
I've actually been out for a while.

1209
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,613
How long?

1210
01:20:35,979 --> 01:20:37,380
A year and a bit.

1211
01:20:38,612 --> 01:20:40,613
A year and a bit?
What the hell?

1212
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:42,446
You don't
call or write

1213
01:20:42,513 --> 01:20:43,646
and you've been out
a year and a bit?

1214
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:45,113
I wrote you
a hundred times

1215
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:47,245
from prison.
I didn't hear anything back.

1216
01:20:47,311 --> 01:20:48,779
No response, nothing.

1217
01:20:49,779 --> 01:20:51,147
Why would I think
anything would change

1218
01:20:51,214 --> 01:20:52,647
when I got out here?

1219
01:20:54,412 --> 01:20:56,547
Did you even read
any of my letters?

1220
01:20:57,812 --> 01:20:59,746
I was kind of on the
road for a while.

1221
01:21:01,547 --> 01:21:02,712
I got 'em
when I got back,

1222
01:21:02,779 --> 01:21:04,879
and I read some
of them. I just...

1223
01:21:08,714 --> 01:21:10,880
What have you been
doing for over a year?

1224
01:21:12,146 --> 01:21:14,681
Well, I got a...
I got a business.

1225
01:21:14,748 --> 01:21:15,914
A little, uh,

1226
01:21:17,447 --> 01:21:19,880
print and copy business
down at Center City.

1227
01:21:22,714 --> 01:21:25,281
It's called Center City Print & Copy.
Catchy, huh?

1228
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:26,915
- A print shop?
- Yep.

1229
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:29,781
How did you
afford that?

1230
01:21:30,714 --> 01:21:32,148
I wouldn't go
too far there.

1231
01:21:32,215 --> 01:21:34,649
I mean, it was only a
couple thousand down.

1232
01:21:34,716 --> 01:21:38,447
Previous owner had bad business
sense and terminal cancer.

1233
01:21:38,514 --> 01:21:40,415
It's a tiny
business,

1234
01:21:40,482 --> 01:21:42,048
but I do have
one account.

1235
01:21:42,115 --> 01:21:45,614
One client that's, you
know, a pretty big deal,

1236
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,383
that covers me
all right.

1237
01:21:48,581 --> 01:21:50,515
In fact, I was able, recently,

1238
01:21:50,582 --> 01:21:52,881
to do something I've been
dreaming about for...

1239
01:21:54,082 --> 01:21:55,015
a long time.

1240
01:21:55,881 --> 01:21:56,915
[Jennifer] What?

1241
01:21:59,416 --> 01:22:00,917
I took a one-month
rental...

1242
01:22:02,248 --> 01:22:04,116
of a cabin

1243
01:22:04,184 --> 01:22:06,549
up at the lake where
we spent that summer.

1244
01:22:07,183 --> 01:22:08,182
[Jennifer] Mm-hmm.

1245
01:22:08,249 --> 01:22:10,451
And matter of fact,

1246
01:22:11,583 --> 01:22:14,817
I was thinking
of going out there

1247
01:22:14,883 --> 01:22:16,683
this weekend,
just for a day.

1248
01:22:16,749 --> 01:22:18,315
I don't have
a lot of time,

1249
01:22:18,382 --> 01:22:19,517
parole and all that,

1250
01:22:19,584 --> 01:22:21,383
so I'd like to make
the time special

1251
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:22,884
if I'm gonna
spend time there.

1252
01:22:22,951 --> 01:22:25,551
I thought maybe you
and I'd go open her up.

1253
01:22:25,618 --> 01:22:27,317
Barbecue,

1254
01:22:27,384 --> 01:22:29,018
take the boat out
on the lake.

1255
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:36,017
Um, I don't
think I can.

1256
01:22:38,485 --> 01:22:39,851
Well, hey,
let's see...

1257
01:22:41,817 --> 01:22:44,183
How about this following
weekend, what's that, uh...

1258
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,783
[paper rustling]

1259
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:48,784
- That's the, uh...
- I have to work next weekend.

1260
01:22:50,617 --> 01:22:52,350
Hey, how about the
weekend after that?

1261
01:22:52,418 --> 01:22:54,019
That'd be the 30th.

1262
01:22:56,152 --> 01:22:57,551
I don't know,
I have to check.

1263
01:22:57,618 --> 01:22:59,252
[John] Okay, well,
why don't you check,

1264
01:22:59,319 --> 01:23:00,984
and if you can't
make it,

1265
01:23:01,051 --> 01:23:03,453
we can do it the weekend after that.
I'm pretty flexible.

1266
01:23:21,152 --> 01:23:22,287
[John] Here.

1267
01:23:23,086 --> 01:23:25,820
This is it. <i>Chez moi.</i>

1268
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,287
It's not that bad.

1269
01:23:30,353 --> 01:23:31,920
I'll be getting out
in a few weeks.

1270
01:23:35,786 --> 01:23:36,886
[Jennifer sighs]

1271
01:23:39,954 --> 01:23:42,721
I just don't know if I'm
ready for any of this, Dad.

1272
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:46,720
It's a lot.

1273
01:23:50,253 --> 01:23:51,487
[John sighs softly]

1274
01:23:54,553 --> 01:23:56,621
So, you have
my number.

1275
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,754
[pats pocket]
I do. I do.

1276
01:24:01,054 --> 01:24:03,955
So, you'll let me know
if you change your mind.

1277
01:24:04,654 --> 01:24:06,089
Come by.

1278
01:24:06,154 --> 01:24:07,954
- Yeah.
- And I'm flexible.

1279
01:24:08,021 --> 01:24:10,887
You know, I could do pretty
much any time you want.

1280
01:24:11,989 --> 01:24:12,788
Um...

1281
01:24:14,122 --> 01:24:16,188
Well, I, uh...

1282
01:24:16,254 --> 01:24:18,021
I'm just so
proud of you,

1283
01:24:18,087 --> 01:24:22,154
it felt...
it was so great to see you.

1284
01:24:22,221 --> 01:24:24,322
I mean, all that
you've achieved.

1285
01:24:27,788 --> 01:24:30,788
I guess what remains to be said,

1286
01:24:31,622 --> 01:24:33,788
and I hope
you believe this...

1287
01:24:36,521 --> 01:24:40,389
is that...
people do change.

1288
01:24:48,423 --> 01:24:51,290
[melancholy music
playing]

1289
01:25:07,757 --> 01:25:09,591

01:25:32,624 --> 01:25:35,724
[muffled voice of
young Jennifer echoing]

<i>will you,

<i>Jen, please call.</i>

<i>Hey, Jen.
I know you're busy.</i>

1311
01:26:28,627 --> 01:26:30,027
<i>Just wanted to
remind you that</i>

1312
01:26:30,093 --> 01:26:32,928
<i>there's a beautiful lake
one phone call away.</i>

1313
01:26:39,794 --> 01:26:43,061
[young Jennifer]
Texas, Utah,

1314
01:26:43,127 --> 01:26:45,893
Vermont, Virginia,

01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,528
<i>Washington,
West Virginia,</i>

1316
01:26:48,595 --> 01:26:51,028
Wisconsin, Wyoming.

1317
01:26:54,428 --> 01:26:55,662
[John] Look at that.

1318
01:26:58,928 --> 01:27:02,296
<i>You've got a,
a delicate kind of beauty.</i>

1319
01:27:03,295 --> 01:27:05,095
You got
delicate features,

1320
01:27:05,162 --> 01:27:07,296
like I did
when I was your age.

1321
01:27:08,394 --> 01:27:10,728
Your nose, your eyes,

1322
01:27:11,528 --> 01:27:13,529
and I see that
little gap closed

1323
01:27:13,594 --> 01:27:15,328
- twixt your teeth.
- [chuckles]

1324
01:27:16,162 --> 01:27:17,630
When you're older,

1325
01:27:18,728 --> 01:27:21,862
you'll have a more
unusual beauty.

1326
01:27:21,929 --> 01:27:24,629
People gotta look real hard to see
it, but if they look,

1327
01:27:25,595 --> 01:27:27,895
<i>they'll see it,
'cause it's there.</i>

1328
01:27:32,861 --> 01:27:34,828
<i>I think the greatest
hope a man can have</i>

1329
01:27:34,895 --> 01:27:37,731
<i>is to leave something
beautiful behind.</i>

1330
01:27:40,995 --> 01:27:42,663
Something that
he made.

1331
01:27:44,929 --> 01:27:46,030

[dial pad beeping]

[knocking]

1336
01:28:39,598 --> 01:28:42,165
[John] I am so damn
happy you came out here.

1337
01:28:42,231 --> 01:28:44,433
[geese honking]

1338
01:28:45,965 --> 01:28:46,766
Jennifer...

1339
01:28:49,398 --> 01:28:50,898
I want to apologize.

1340
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:58,567
I had a long time to...

1341
01:28:59,799 --> 01:29:02,266
to reflect on
my mistakes.

1342
01:29:03,266 --> 01:29:04,733
I've mulled it...

1343
01:29:06,499 --> 01:29:08,834
and weighed
my responsibilities,

1344
01:29:08,899 --> 01:29:13,900
and I want to apologize...
for what happened.

1345
01:29:13,967 --> 01:29:15,934
You know, all of it.

1346
01:29:16,966 --> 01:29:18,066
The other day,

1347
01:29:18,134 --> 01:29:19,700
when you dropped me
at the halfway house,

1348
01:29:19,767 --> 01:29:22,101
I was watching
you drive away

1349
01:29:22,166 --> 01:29:23,668
and I thought
to myself,

1350
01:29:24,534 --> 01:29:26,268
"What can I do
to help?

1351
01:29:27,299 --> 01:29:30,268
What can
you do, John,

1352
01:29:31,733 --> 01:29:33,367
to give her
something real,

1353
01:29:33,433 --> 01:29:35,867
something practical?"

1354
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:41,268
So, last Tuesday,
right after we met,

1355
01:29:41,335 --> 01:29:43,235
I called a dealer
I know

1356
01:29:43,301 --> 01:29:45,669
and I put a $5,000
deposit down

1357
01:29:45,736 --> 01:29:49,668
on a 1989 XJS Jaguar,
flamenco red,

1358
01:29:49,734 --> 01:29:52,035
biscuit leather
interior and top.

1359
01:29:52,102 --> 01:29:55,467
I mean, it's a stunner
and drives like new.

1360
01:29:55,535 --> 01:29:57,569
What are you
talking about, Dad?

1361
01:29:58,368 --> 01:29:59,502
You've had
all this time

1362
01:29:59,569 --> 01:30:00,936
and this is how
you're talking?

1363
01:30:02,135 --> 01:30:04,603
- It's a fantasy.
- Oh, is that so?

1364
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:06,602
- Says who?
- I don't want a Jaguar.

1365
01:30:06,668 --> 01:30:08,236
- You don't want a Jaguar?
- It's a fantasy.

1366
01:30:08,303 --> 01:30:09,803
It's a fucked-up
fantasy.

1367
01:30:09,870 --> 01:30:12,737
Does a $5,000 deposit sound
like a fantasy to you?

1368
01:30:12,802 --> 01:30:14,835
- I just wanna go back in.
- Jen.

1369
