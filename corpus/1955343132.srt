what do you want?

183
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,592
Do you have a place
to spend the night?

184
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,928
Do you have any family,
any friends you can go to?

185
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,464
Any way of earning a living?

186
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:13,072
You could stay on here

grant you that favor.

188

In return for other favors,
of course.

189

work for a short time

192

you ever wanted.

What does Jules
get out of this?

194
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:40,933
More than the cost of a plate?

195
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,303
More than the cost
of 10 plates?

196
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,939

I plan to use you selectively.

No offense, but, uh,

532
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,088
I kind of made up my mind
before I came here

533
00:55:58,122 --> 00:55:59,890
that I wasn't gonna
do anything.

534
00:56:04,562 --> 00:56:06,831
I kinda got this notion,
see how...

535
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,404
How the first time should be
with someone that I love.

knows me better
than I know myself.

00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:55,613
Look at you.

540
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,857
If you were just ordinary,

541
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:09,059
I could resist.

542
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:11,896
I know I could.

546
00:57:25,142 --> 00:57:26,811
What are you gonna do?

547
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:38,789
(SIGHS) I really am a virgin.

548
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:45,229
Uh, but I believe
in beginner's luck.

549
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:29,867
That boy.

550
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:36,040
If he ever shows up again,
I think Mona might be
the girl for him.

551
00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:39,610
Oh, that's right.
Mona's gone.

552
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:46,617
How much money
did you give her?

553
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:49,019
Everything I had.

554
00:59:50,888 --> 00:59:53,223
Did she tell you
she was going to Vegas?

555
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:54,959
She usually does.

556
00:59:58,228 --> 00:59:59,730
She'll come back.

557
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:02,800
They always come back.

558
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:09,273
If I wasn't so sure,
I'd be angry.

559

Oh, by the way,

560
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:17,748

I saw you,

1069
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:40,788
even though I didn't know
it was you.

1070
01:42:40,822 --> 01:42:43,758
I loved you at the farm
and I loved you
under the bleachers and...

1071
01:42:46,861 --> 01:42:47,795
(SIGHS)

1072
01:42:47,829 --> 01:42:49,464
And I love you now.

1073
01:42:53,535 --> 01:42:54,602
Please.

1074
01:43:05,347 --> 01:43:07,649
You know it's possible
you could be my salvation.

1075
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:10,985
(LAUGHS)

1076
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:12,854
You know I think I like
"I love you" better.

1077
01:43:12,887 --> 01:43:13,955
(LAUGHS)

1078
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:24,566
