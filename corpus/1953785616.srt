1
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:09,357
Northern region, sector 17-Alpha.

2
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:13,336
Log date 8313-Omega-3.
Jor-El speaking.

3
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,270
Gathering readings
for final subterranean probe.

4
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,431
I hope everything went smoothly, sir.

5
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,403
Frostbite, ice monsters.
Same old, same old.

6
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,136
Good afternoon, Jor-EI.

7
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,080
Brainiac. What an unpleasant surprise.

8
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,079
I'm awaiting your data.

9
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,048
Have you been spying on me
with your satellites again?

10
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,781
The Planetary Council demands
that I analyze your data...

11
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,652
...as soon as you obtain it.

12
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,257
Brainiac, somewhere in all those
trillions of file clusters...

13
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:20,490
...there's got to be one that says
people don't like to be spied upon.

14
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,061
Then why did they create me?

15
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,999
A question I often ask myself.

16
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,999
Transmission set. It's feeding time.

17
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,508
Data received. Ending transmission.

18
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,944
You're welcome. Glutton.

19
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,516
Hey, Kal, what do you have there?

20
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,022
Oh, great.

21
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:49,491
Kal-El was helping me check the solar
panels when he discovered a playmate.

22
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,129
I heard you had fun too.

23
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:54,789
Oh, yes, I encountered
a very friendly shoggot.

24
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,459
All in all, I prefer your arms.

25
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:00,973
We're moving.

26
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,438
What forsaken spot are we going to now?

27
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,635
- Home, Lara.
- Home?

28
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,074
That's right.

29
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,216
What, five months in this deep freeze
not enough for you?

30
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:14,376
No, it's just that once we're back,
you'll start going over the data.

31
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:18,752
I keep thinking, "What if it supports
your theory? What then?"

32
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,359
We can deal with it. Trust me.

33
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,051
The truth can only help.

34
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,461
Oh, Jor-EI. Such a beautiful world,
even up here.

35
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,159
It's hard to believe it could
all come to an end.

36
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:48,449
All I can tell you, Lara,
is that if he persists...

37
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,182
...in predicting the end of the world,
it'll be the end, all right.

38
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,849
Of his political and professional career.

39
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,924
But what if he's right, Father?

40
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,688
Try convincing the council.

41
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,197
He hasn't one supporter for his theory.

42
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,029
They even avoid him in the hallways.
You know why?

43
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,864
Why is that, Sul-Van?

44
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,872
Because you can never be wrong, Jor-EI.

45
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:13,536
You can never let it go.
You have an ego the size of Argos.

46
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,341
I never let my ego get in the way
of the facts.

47
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:19,508
Well, let me let you in on a little fact.

48
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,849
Unless Brainiac agrees with you,
it's all over.

49
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:26,719
No more expeditions,
no more research, no more...

50
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:31,028
- It's another temblor.
- Kal-EI!

51
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,783
Hush.

52
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,103
You'd better be wrong, Jor-EI.

53
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,706
You'd better be dead wrong.

54
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,579
Each of you should have my report.

55
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:25,684
It distills all the data I've gathered so far
and leaves no doubt that...

56
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:29,447
That the planet's core is undergoing
a mounting chain reaction...

57
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:31,920
...that will eventually destroy Krypton!

58
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,581
- Lunacy!
- Ask Brainiac!

59
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,422
Yes, Brainiac. He'll tell us.

60
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,292
Silence. Silence. Enough!

61
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:43,026
I presume you've submitted
your findings to Brainiac?

62
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,635
Yes.

63
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,965
So, what say you, Brainiac?

64
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:52,237
One can appreciate Jor-EI's hard work.
However, he is still mistaken.

65
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,039
As I've stated before...

66
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:58,309
...the temblors are the result
of a slight polar shift, no more...

67
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,578
...and will soon abate.
- He' s wrong! He doesn ' t know!

68
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:07,258
Nonsense! There isn't a square foot
of this planet Brainiac doesn't know.

69
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:12,455
He was built to monitor all of Krypton
and has, I might add, served us far better...

70
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,931
...than upstart scientists
with apocalyptic visions.

71
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:20,933
Your faith in him will be the end of us all.
Act now and we can save everyone.

72
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,268
And how do you propose to do that?

73
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,276
Put everyone in the Phantom Zone.

74
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:36,016
You're asking us to put ourselves among
the vilest criminals in the galaxy?

75
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,054
You're mad!

76
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,623
We can restore ourselves later,
on another planet.

77
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,558
It would only take one man.

78
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,857
Listen to me! I've built a ship!

79
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,092
Listen, please!

80
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,685
So, son, how does it feel
not to have a worry in the world?

81
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:28,899
- Think we can get the baby to bed early?
- I have to go down to Brainiac operations.

82
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,504
No.

83
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,577
- Lara, he's lying.
- He's a machine.

84
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,008
He's still lying. I have to know why.

85
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,583
Has it occurred to you
that he could be right?

86
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,346
That somewhere
you might have made a mistake?

87
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,251
It's no crime to be wrong!

88
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,020
Please, Lara.

89
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,490
Go, Jor-EI.

90
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:51,892
Find out once and for all.
We've lived like this too long.

91
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:55,591
Your theories are more destructive
than you can imagine.

92
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,488
Good evening, Jor-EI.
You've been busy tonight.

93
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,057
May I be of service?

94
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,286
Just trying to find out
why we disagree, Brainiac.

95
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,563
Human error, I'm afraid.

96
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,894
Funny, I didn't think
you were afraid of anything.

97
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,401
Is something wrong?

98
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,199
You're denying me access
to satellite com.

99
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,068
What's going on in there?

100
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,905
Currently reallocating
security file clusters.

101
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,809
Well, let's just see
if I can override that.

102
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,955
Why do I get the feeling
you're trying to hide something?

103
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,697
Access denied.

104
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,128
I don't think so.

105
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,268
This is a breach of security, Jor-EI.

106
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,467
A violation of statute 107653...

107
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,478
...subsection 4.85.

108
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:19,607
You ' re downloading. You're transmitting
your memory to a satellite.

109
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,782
You're saving yourself.

110
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,216
I must.

111
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:27,416
After all, am I not the repository
of all Kryptonian knowledge?

112
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,061
Should I not be saved above all?

113
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,629
You self-righteous monster!

114
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,628
Temper, temper, Jor-EI.

115
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,964
If you stop me, there won 't even
be a memory of Krypton left.

116
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:44,868
All its culture, its wonders and glory,
will be dust in the cosmos.

117
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,705
Is that what you want?

118
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,540
Why did you lie?

119
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,012
If the council knew
Krypton was doomed...

120
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:55,210
...they would frantically put me to work
on calculating an evacuation plan.

121
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,024
A futile gesture,
given the time remaining.

122
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,624
How much time is left?

123
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:06,259
Hours. This world has seen
its last sunrise.

124
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,293
Hold it right there!

125
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,901
- Jor-EI?
- We received an alert from Brainiac.

126
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,301
- There's an intruder.
- He's the intruder. Arrest him.

127
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,448
Stop!

128
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,022
That's right.
Jor-El has just fled Sat Com.

129
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,890
- Secure stations.
- Be warned, he is armed.

130
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,931
Use of deadly force is advised.

131
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,957
He's heading our way!

132
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:11,460
I know. This time I will handle it.

133
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,150
Great Rao.

134
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,490
Where is he?

135
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:40,818
What did you say?

136
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,751
Jor-EI? Where is he?

137
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,758
Level five, north wing.

138
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,427
Down here!

139
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,904
- There he is.
- Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!

140
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,341
He's getting away!

141
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,771
Then you've read it?

142
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,081
Yes. And as much as I don't want
to believe it...

143
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,116
...your husband's findings
are hard to discount.

144
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,447
Still, there's the Brainiac question.

145
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:47,620
Jor-EI! Father's read your report.
He thinks he can help.

146
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,921
- Yes, I think it's worth it...
- It's too late.

147
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,323
- Good Lord.
- What happened?

148
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,625
Brainiac tried to kill me.
The police will be here soon.

149
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,996
Remember when I told you what we'd do
if worst came to worse?

150
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,506
- No!
- I'm sorry.

151
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,668
I never thought it would come to this.

152
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,610
Come to what?
What are you talking about?

153
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,407
What's this nonsense about Brainiac?

154
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:16,681
Sul-Van, if you love your grandson
and care one whit about his future...

155
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,790
...you'll kindly shut up!

156
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,002
Sleep, Kal-EI, my beautiful child...

157
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,843
...my heartbeat, my life.

158
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,683
Send Kal-El to another world?

159
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:51,186
- You can't be serious!
- The ship will get him there.

160
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,117
I know. I built it.
It was part of the plan.

161
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:58,127
Save everyone in the Phantom Zone,
travel to Earth, then bring them back.

162
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:02,165
Now it's only good for a lifeboat.
And the passenger will be my son...

163
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,303
...the last son of Krypton.

164
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,667
Lara!

165
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,344
I'm ready. He's sedated.

166
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,540
The police are here.
They'll break into the lab to get me.

167
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,379
If I lead them away
while you set up the launch...

168
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,519
I can't do it all myself.

169
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:26,317
I'll be back. I promise.

170
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,260
Lara, please, this is madness!

171
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,525
Father, I love you dearly,
but this is my baby's life.

172
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,868
But he can't outrun the police.

173
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,368
Do you have a better idea?

174
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:48,873
See him?

175
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:51,346
Not yet. They have the lights off.

176
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,350
Wait! There's movement
in the hover port.

177
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,022
Look out!

178
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,896
I hope his crash bags are working.

179
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,909
Good evening. Is there a problem?

180
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,499
I've got the hyperspace coordinates
locked in.

181
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,160
Once he gets to Earth he'll be safe.

182
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,905
Lara, I could send you with him.

183
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:55,906
There's a risk, but if I have time
to recalibrate the course...

184
00:16:57,116 --> 00:17:00,176
No, my love. I'm staying with you.

185
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,192
The patrol's reporting in.
Jor-EI's escaped the perimeter.

186
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,396
- They're requesting further instructions.
- It doesn't matter anymore.

187
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,973
Farewell, Krypton.

188
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,103
- Hey, what's going on?
- Where'd he go?

189
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,439
Where's Brainiac?

190
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,990
Not another one.

191
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,559
No. The last one.

192
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,229
Goodbye, Kal-EI.

193
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,581
Holy Christmas! What was that?

194
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,099
Over here, Martha. Martha?

195
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,514
Martha? Martha?

196
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,557
You'll wake him.

197
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,062
Martha, what are you doing?

198
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:42,162
Put that thing back.
We don't know where it came from.

199
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:46,737
He's not a thing, Jonathan.
He's a baby. A little baby.

200
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,930
Who would put a baby in a spaceship?

201
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,268
That's just my point. Could be Russian.

202
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,071
- A sputnik baby.
- Oh, really!

203
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,508
Maybe he's one of ours.

204
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:59,139
- You think NASA's missing a kid?
- I don't care where he came from.

205
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:03,084
All I know is, he needs us, Jonathan.
Look how he's reaching out to you.

206
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,221
Cute little fella.

207
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,553
Got a good grip too.

208
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,757
What do you think of
the name Christopher?

209
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,594
Now, Martha, let's discuss this.

210
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,259
- Or Kevin?
- Martha!

211
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,530
Or Kirk?

212
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:24,198
I know. We can use my maiden name.
What do you think of...?

213
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,103
Clark!

214
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,009
Clark Kent!

215
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,475
Yes, Ms. Stevenson?

216
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:33,777
Looks like you daydreamed your way
to another perfect score.

217
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:37,012
Once again the boy genius
performs to his usual standards.

218
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,918
And so did you, Miss Lang.

219
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:50,594
For a guy who just aced his midterms,
you don't look too happy. What's wrong?

220
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:54,097
Oh, I don't know.
Lately I'm feeling kind of weird.

221
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,569
You've always been weird,
if you ask me.

222
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,105
Hey, it's Lana. The girl who's had
a crush on you since we were 3.

223
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,078
- You can tell me.
- It's just...

224
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,083
...in the last few months,
I've been hearing things.

225
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,949
Things I couldn't before.
Like over there.

226
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,819
Jenny's telling Pete Ross
her folks are out tonight.

227
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:16,552
That little tart! You heard that?

228
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,288
And I can see things too,
like in the gym.

229
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:26,733
Ms. Stevenson's putting up
decorations for the dance.

230
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,600
Someone should hold that ladder.

231
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,038
You're saying you can see through walls?

232
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:34,906
So how many times have you peeked
into the girls' locker room?

233
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,740
- Lana!
- I'm just kidding. Jeez!

234
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,182
It's not a joke, Lana.
I'm going through a bad time.

235
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,618
I thought if anybody'd
understand, it'd be...

236
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,257
- Listen!
- What is it?

237
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,424
Call an ambulance!
There's gonna be an accident!

238
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,092
How do you know? Clark!

239
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,883
Hey, stop!

240
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,645
- Mommy!
- Annie!

241
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,641
Help me! Mom and Daddy!

242
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,417
Oh, my God! Clark! Clark!

243
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,400
Mommy!

244
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,535
Annie!

245
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,103
You're not even burned. How...?

246
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,341
I don't know.

247
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,108
Getting stronger every day, Pa.

248
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,008
Hello?

249
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,585
And that's not the half of it. Look.

250
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,618
It's getting hot.

251
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,224
- All you did was look at it.
- I know.

252
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:31,828
Yes, dear, I'll tell him.

253
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,795
That was Lana.
Third time tonight, Clark.

254
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,365
Won't you talk to her?

255
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,800
What can I say, Ma?
I don't even know how it happened.

256
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:43,236
Suddenly I was running faster
than I've ever run in my life.

257
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:47,071
I ripped the camper apart like cardboard.
The fire never touched me.

258
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:50,646
I always felt different,
even before you told me I was adopted...

259
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,874
...but how is it possible to do this?

260
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,417
I think it's time, Martha.

261
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,329
We never showed you this, son.

262
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,091
I guess we didn't know
how to explain it.

263
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,893
Still don't.

264
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,999
You know how some babies
are found in baskets?

265
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,573
Well, this is how we found you.

266
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,903
You're kidding, right?

267
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,343
You're not.

268
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:28,350
- So where did I come from?
- We don't know.

269
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:32,987
There wasn't much inside,
just some blankets and this.

270
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:37,026
Never could get the darn thing open.
Maybe you've got the magic touch.

271
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,278
What's happening?

272
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,180
- Kal-EI?
- Who?

273
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:05,187
Hello, son. You've activated the message
we placed in your escape rocket.

274
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:08,258
- I am Jor-EI.
- And I am Lara.

275
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,825
We are your parents.

276
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:20,971
By the time you see this, our world will
have been gone for many years.

277
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,539
You are the sole survivor of Krypton...

278
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:27,701
...a planet similar to Earth in many ways.
This was our home.

279
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,177
No. No, it can't be true.

280
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:32,873
- It's hurting him.
- Let him be, Martha.

281
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,487
You may have discovered that you are
much stronger and faster...

282
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,179
...than a normal human being.

283
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,983
I am a normal human being!

284
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,491
Your Kryptonian body draws its strength
from Earth's yellow sun.

285
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,324
It will give you abilities
that no other human has.

286
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,965
I don't believe any of this.

287
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:52,069
Some people will fear you,
perhaps even try to destroy you.

288
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,764
Despite this, you must never
use your powers in anger.

289
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,237
Be brave, my son.

290
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,742
Remember who you are and the legacy
you carry inside you.

291
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,346
We love you, Kal-EI. Always.

292
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,857
It's not true.

293
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,022
I'm not a freak. I'm not.

294
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,164
I'm not!

295
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,593
Clark!

296
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,703
Clark, come back!

297
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,217
Yes!

298
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,423
Oh, yeah!

299
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:59,891
Ma! Pa!

300
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,467
Oh, Clark!

301
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,242
It's okay.

302
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,758
Metropolis can boast
of many amazing sights:

303
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:31,418
The country's biggest bridge.
The world's tallest building.

304
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:36,256
But now it may have its most
astonishing sight: a guardian angel.

305
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:39,767
Just ask little Danitra Evans.
She saw him.

306
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:43,999
I was fooling around the window
when I lost my balance and fell.

307
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:48,908
Suddenly this big blue angel with
red wings came down and caught me.

308
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,776
He put me on the ground
and flew away.

309
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,544
You should've heard my mommy scream.

310
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:59,952
This is where they found Danitra,
and that's where she fell from.

311
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:05,794
Thirty floors up. If it wasn 't an angel
that saved her, what was it?

312
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,522
Friendly pigeons.

313
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,929
What's the matter?
Don't believe in angels?

314
00:31:10,101 --> 00:31:13,935
It's TV, boys, just a trumped-up story
to boost ratings.

315
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,936
And maybe sell some papers?

316
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:22,068
Chief, I spent a week on the docks
with rats and frizzed hair...

317
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,216
...exposing the biggest gun-smuggling ring
in 10 years...

318
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,112
...and what makes the front page?

319
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:31,085
Some sprouty, New Age,
granola-crunching fluff piece on angels.

320
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:35,556
- What's next? Interviews with Bigfoot?
- Good timing, Lois.

321
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,561
I want you to be the first to know
I'm hiring a new guy on the city desk.

322
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,460
Is he cute?

323
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:44,727
- You tell me.
- Oh, hi.

324
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:47,401
- Hello.
- This is the guy, Lois.

325
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:52,236
- Clark Kent from Smallville.
- Smallville? Never heard of it.

326
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,072
- Have you ever been to Kansas?
- God, no.

327
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,305
I've been reading his stuff. It's good.

328
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:01,418
I thought maybe he could tag along
with you to get the lay of the land.

329
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,750
I'd love to play den mother, but I got
that Lexcorp story in half an hour.

330
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,655
Oh, yeah. The great and benevolent
Mr. Luthor...

331
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:12,557
...is demonstrating
a new weapons system today.

332
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,460
Lex is Lois' beat,
but I'm sure she won't mind...

333
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:19,160
...having another set
of eyes with her. Right, Lois?

334
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:25,001
Smallville, nothing against you, but
even as a kid I never liked babysitting.

335
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,803
You wanna keep up, be quick.

336
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:31,176
- I'm no tour guide and I don't hold hands.
- You won't have to worry about that.

337
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,977
Jimmy. Jimmy Olsen,
say hello to Clark Kent.

338
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,619
- The new guy?
- Yeah.

339
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,254
Nice to meet you. I'm Jimmy.

340
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,754
I work as a copy boy,
but I'm a photographer.

341
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,018
- Good for you.
- I'd like to show you my pictures.

342
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,992
- Well, not right...
- They're hot, Mr. Kent, really.

343
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,691
I'm fearless. You can ask Miss Lane.
She uses me all the time.

344
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,864
Bye.

345
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,729
So I see.

346
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,152
You sure my nose isn't shiny?

347
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,317
Angela, don't tell me
you're actually covering real news.

348
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,123
What happened?
Run out of alien abductees?

349
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:23,426
At least my network
doesn't have to send two reporters...

350
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,967
...to cover the same story.

351
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,239
You'll have to introduce us sometime.

352
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,171
- Thanks for the quote.
- How did you get here so fast?

353
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,901
Oh, I just flew.

354
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:38,105
- What'd you get?
- A shared byline, if you use it.

355
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,843
I apologize. You're not
the rube hayseed I took you for.

356
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,851
Thanks. I think.

357
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,922
Ladies and gentlemen of the press...

358
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,754
...at this time we invite everyone into
the main hall for our special presentation.

359
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:54,989
The long-awaited debut of the next word
in military defense:

360
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:58,499
The Lexoskel 5000.

361
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:11,915
Constructed from a patented alloy,
the Lexo suit is virtually indestructible.

362
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:15,211
As seen in this footage
against these automated tanks...

363
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,886
...the Lexo suit stands up
to heavy punishment...

364
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,228
...and returns it in kind.

365
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,506
Guiding this suit is a single soldier...

366
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:40,371
...made more powerful
than an entire battalion.

367
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:46,950
And now, here' s to the future,
and the man who' s created it, Lex Luthor.

368
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:55,725
Bet you this beats
the dog-and-pony shows back home.

369
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,867
Time to crash the party, gentlemen.

370
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:19,045
- Excuse me.
- I'd like to say that I view the Lexo suit...

371
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:23,950
...not as an instrument of war,
but as an instrument to end war.

372
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,078
No way.

373
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,722
- It's him!
- The guy with the cape!

374
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:52,007
Gentlemen, believe it or not,
we are being tailed at 6 o'clock.

375
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:38,921
I don't know who he is
or what he is, but he's all yours.

376
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,155
I've got him.

377
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,422
He's dust.

378
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,811
Nice one, Clark.

379
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,686
- Look out. It's gonna hit us!
- My God!

380
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,413
Run, run, run!

381
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,048
- Oh, my gosh.
- Jump!

382
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,731
Did you see that?

383
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,334
Freeze it.

384
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:50,173
What is that? Can anyone tell me?

385
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,377
Looks like a flying guy.

386
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,610
No kidding. I know he's flying,
but who is he?

387
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,516
Where did he come from?
What does he want?

388
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,916
- Look who I'm asking.
- Nice S.

389
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:06,257
- Excuse me?
- Right here. He's strong. He flies.

390
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:10,628
He's the Nietzschean fantasy ideal
all wrapped up in a red cape.

391
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,793
- The superman.
- Superman?

392
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,404
Hey, I like it.

393
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:19,873
Superman. It's catchy, sticks with you.
The kind of name that looks great...

394
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,376
...splashed across three columns...
Four...

395
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:25,310
...provided one of you
can get an interview with him.

396
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,214
Somehow, I don't think a guy
like that has a press agent, chief.

397
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:32,378
Well, somebody better get something
on this guy fast.

398
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:36,253
I've never seen the city in such a state.
Look at these faxes.

399
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:39,794
If we don't get answers soon
there could be a full-scale panic.

400
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:43,966
We've kept this book since
you left Smallville.

401
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:47,467
Every time we read about
an invisible angel helping someone...

402
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,629
...we knew our Clark had to be nearby.

403
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:54,507
But now that I've settled in Metropolis,
it's impossible to keep a low profile.

404
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:58,978
I can see where landing a plane in the
middle of the city might turn a few heads.

405
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:03,245
It's not just that.
Suddenly, people are calling me Superman.

406
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,787
They want to know everything about me.
Some are afraid of me...

407
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,822
...like Jor-El and Lara warned.

408
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:12,026
Does this mean I'm going to have
to give up my life?

409
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,962
No, son. It doesn't matter where
you were born or what you can do.

410
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:20,263
You'll always be Clark Kent.
Superman just helps out now and then.

411
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,736
It wouldn't be bad if people knew
a little more about Superman.

412
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:27,309
I don't want anyone thinking
you're like that nut in Gotham City.

413
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:30,914
There must be some way
to get the word out.

414
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:35,213
Sorry, Perry. I checked with Star Labs...

415
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:39,288
...and they're just as clueless
as everyone else about our flyboy.

416
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:42,516
Right. I'm heading back now.

417
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,619
Excuse me, Miss Lane. I believe
I'm the one you want to talk to.

418
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,197
Oh, yeah? Well, where are you?

419
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:50,998
I'm...

420
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,136
Just hang on.

421
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,010
As far as I can piece together...

422
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,208
...I'm the last survivor
of a planet called Krypton.

423
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,386
Krypton?

424
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:12,749
Okay.

425
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,391
You don't believe me?

426
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,584
It's a little much.

427
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,126
Fair enough.

428
00:43:19,296 --> 00:43:21,389
All I ask is that you tell the truth.

429
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:25,665
- And that is?
- I'm not here to scare anyone.

430
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,469
In fact, I've always tried to help people
whenever possible.

431
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,734
You sound too good to be true.
What's your secret?

432
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,604
What do you mean?

433
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,906
You don't go around in blue tights
and a cape all the time.

434
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:43,409
- What do you do in your off-hours?
- I think that's a question for another time.

435
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,893
Well, well, an alien in my own back yard.

436
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,698
And such a civic-minded one too.

437
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,301
I think he means what he says, Lex.

438
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,268
Well, that's just dandy, Lois.

439
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:05,875
All I know is,
your hero did nothing to help me.

440
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:09,035
I'm the one who's out
a billion-dollar battle suit.

441
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:12,444
Actually, this could end up
a silver lining in your pocket.

442
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:14,208
What's that?

443
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,615
Since the terrorists have
your prototype...

444
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:20,348
...the Pentagon's gonna want you
to build a better version for them.

445
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:25,223
When all is said and done, this could
net you a multi-billion dollar windfall.

446
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,996
Lois, it almost sounds
as if your friend here...

447
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,567
...is suggesting I should be glad
my suit was stolen.

448
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:36,638
You're very amusing, Mr... Kent, is it?

449
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:39,970
Yes, I'll remember that.

450
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:42,644
Nice work, Smallville.

451
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,312
You're only the second person
I've seen get under Lex's skin.

452
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:50,317
- Who's the first?
- Me. When I dumped him.

453
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,115
Ancient history. What makes you think...

454
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,918
...Lex might have been
an accessory to the theft?

455
00:44:56,093 --> 00:45:00,655
I don't think it was a theft.
I think he gave it away.

456
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,071
I was digging up background info
on Luthor...

457
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:13,175
...and found this photo at last year's
International Industrial Conference.

458
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,738
Recognize the guy with the medals?

459
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,847
The regent of Kaznia. So?

460
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:22,747
So the U.S. and Kaznia haven't been
on real friendly terms lately.

461
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:27,357
It seems the regent's been employing
terrorists to eliminate his political enemies.

462
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:32,084
Old news, Kent. The president broke
diplomatic ties with Kaznia months ago.

463
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:35,231
Which means Luthor couldn't
sell the regent a war suit...

464
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,424
...without it being an act of treason.

465
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:41,565
So Luthor just left the back door open
for him to take it.

466
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,169
- It works in theory.
- In theory, maybe...

467
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,866
...but Perry White doesn't run theories.

468
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:50,136
- Where are you going?
- I'd tell you...

469
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,782
...but you'd have to share the byline.

470
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,483
I've told you before, there's no work
for you on this ship.

471
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,591
Now leave, before I call
the harbor police.

472
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,824
I'm going, you blasted rat bag,
I'm going.

473
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:13,434
Blasted scabs taking jobs
from us union men.

474
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,596
I ought to go back and split
some skulls, I ought to.

475
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,937
Got a tire iron right here.

476
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:36,048
Oh, it's you, Miss Lane.
Come to do another smuggling story?

477
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:38,956
Maybe. What can you
tell me about that tanker?

478
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:41,797
It's the darndest thing I ever seen.

479
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:46,163
She's been in port a week
and ain't moved a bit of cargo on or off.

480
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:50,102
Blasted scow's leaving port tonight,
and I says good riddance.

481
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:51,673
Gotta get on that ship.

482
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:56,073
Bibbo, take this and call Clark Kent
at the Planet.

483
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:59,579
Tell him where I am and to call
Police Commissioner Henderson...

484
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:04,244
...if he doesn't hear from me in
20 minutes. Got that? 20 minutes.

485
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:06,514
Thanks, Bibbo. I owe you one.

486
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,192
Yeah, sure, sure, sure.

487
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,055
Call Kurt Kent,
let him know about the boat...

488
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:15,198
...and said something about
the police. Yeah, okay.

489
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:18,266
Hey, soda.

490
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,197
She'll be okay.

491
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,673
We're not giving interviews,
you got that?

492
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:31,872
- lf I could just speak to your captain.
- I said no interviews.

493
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:35,815
- What part of that don't you understand?
- Hans. Hans!

494
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:39,450
There's no reason for hostility...

495
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:43,491
...especially towards
such an attractive visitor.

496
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:46,958
I'm John Corben,
special attaché to the regent.

497
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:51,499
- How may I help you, Miss...?
- Lois Lane, Daily Planet.

498
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:53,636
I'm doing a story on gun smuggling...

499
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:57,001
...and was wondering
if I could ask about your cargo.

500
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:59,636
But we have no cargo.

501
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:04,008
You must know there's a trade embargo
between the U.S. and Kaznia.

502
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,342
We're part of a diplomatic envoy...

503
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:10,509
...trying to restore friendly relations
between our countries.

504
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,087
Then you won't mind me
taking a look around.

505
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:18,354
Better yet, why don't we continue
this interview ashore, say, over dinner?

506
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:23,192
I'd be more than happy to answer
any questions that you might have.

507
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,938
I can think of some doozies.

508
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:33,076
I'll bet.

509
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,706
Here's a shot of Luthor getting
a commendation.

510
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,111
A shot of the special crimes unit.

511
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,947
And I took this at the dedication
of the zoo's polar bear exhibit.

512
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,884
- Cute little guy.
- Yeah, nice.

513
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,953
You didn't see Miss Lane
come back, did you?

514
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:52,254
She brought me along to get shots
for her smuggling story.

515
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,421
- Is that right?
- Yeah, have a look.

516
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:02,837
Yeah, I figure a few more shots like that
and Perry's bound to put me on staff.

517
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:06,601
There, in the background.
That ship's a Kaznian tanker.

518
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:10,802
It's so small. How can you tell?

519
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,605
Clark?

520
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:29,998
You're making a big mistake.
Everyone in my office knows where I am.

521
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,928
Sweetheart, if anyone knew or cared,
they would have made a move by now.

522
00:49:40,711 --> 00:49:43,976
We're clear. Lose her.

523
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,292
You again? Get him!

524
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:13,406
Take cover.

525
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,212
Thanks.

526
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,247
Anytime.

527
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,350
So long, sweetheart.

528
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:21,173
Call the police and let them know
what's happening. I'll try to stop it.

529
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:22,709
Be...

530
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:25,178
...careful.

531
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:40,626
This is Corben. Tell the regent his battle
suit is coming to him by special delivery.

532
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,935
Everyone, clear the area now.

533
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,434
Stupid, stupid move, my friend.

534
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:06,273
No!

535
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,903
Gotcha.

536
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:10,298
Shall we go a few rounds
without the suit?

537
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:11,667
Too bad.

538
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:20,780
Yeah, chief, I think stopping the presses
would be a very good idea.

539
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,819
You see, as the agreed-upon merchandise
never left Metropolis...

540
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:31,290
...my client, the regent, respectfully
requests a full and prompt refund.

541
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:34,123
We had an understanding.

542
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:36,959
All I had to do was arrange
for the regent's men...

543
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,226
...to take possession, and they did.

544
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:44,271
Now because of this alien's interference
you expect me to eat a billion dollars?

545
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:48,104
I think you have more pressing concerns
at the moment.

546
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:50,246
Good day.

547
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:00,350
I'm afraid we already have
a window washer.

548
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:04,823
Oh, the silent treatment.

549
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,088
Well, I don't know what you
thought you heard...

550
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:11,597
...but I know what you can prove.
And it's nothing.

551
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,441
You see, Superman...

552
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:25,547
...I own Metropolis. My technology
built it, my will keeps it going...

553
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:29,549
...and two-thirds of its people work for me,
whether they know it or not.

554
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:32,950
Even you have to admit
it's a model of efficiency.

555
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:40,626
And yet I've often thought,
"Why limit myself to just one city?"

556
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:46,099
A being with your abilities
could be very useful to me on a...

557
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:50,296
...shall we say, global scale.

558
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:54,341
Why don't you float on in
and we'll discuss it.

559
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:58,973
Say something!

560
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,917
I'll be watching you, Luthor.

561
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:09,982
Wait, I'm not finished with you!

562
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,920
- Hey, look.
- There he is.

563
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,031
- Superman!
- Get a shot. Superman, come on down.

564
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:19,225
Superman, give us an answer here.

565
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,463
Way to go, big guy. You're okay.

566
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:08,015
Brainiac systems activated.

567
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:47,565
