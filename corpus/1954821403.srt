1
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,625
(door creaking)

2
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:32,100
(tense instrumental music)

3
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:43,377
(gasping for air)

4
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:49,117
(tense instrumental music)

5
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,496
(flames burning)

6
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:05,566
Michelle:
They thought he was dead.

7
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:11,305
My sister, Becky,
put me in a body bag

8
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:13,741
to protect me from the sun.

9
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:19,147
Mr. Thompson, from
the Embassy, helped her.

10
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,737
They were so frightened
they forgot

11
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,440
about the Bloodstone.

12
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:57,185
(water splash)

13
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:02,723
(tense instrumental music)

14
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:33,221
(screaming in pain)

15
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:58,246
(tense instrumental music)

16
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:56,790
(wheel squeaking)

17
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,931
(birds singing)

18
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,747
(phone dialing)

19
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,050
(foreign language)

20
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:28,048
(grasping for air)

21
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,050
Anna: Can you hear me?

22
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,051
Don't be afraid.

23
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,385
Try to stay still.

24
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,787
You've had an accident.

25
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,525
I'm a doctor,
help is on the way.

26
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,459
(phone dialing)

27
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,195
(busy signal)

28
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,667
I'll take you to
a clinic myself.

29
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:53,206
(anxious instrumental music)

30
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,444
Doctor Nicolescu, please.

31
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,080
It's an emergency.

32
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:17,097
(heart rate monitor)

33
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,341
Doctor.

34
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,579
Anna Lazar is at the gate,
she says it's an emergency.

35
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:35,549
Tell the guards to let her in.

36
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,888
I won't do the things

37
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:44,124
that good doctors so
far from the city.

38
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,299
Careful! Take her
inside, quickly!

39
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,134
Anna! What's wrong?

40
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,102
Was it there an accident?

41
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:59,272
Yes! This girl was
the only survivor!

42
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,761
(foreign language)

43
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:27,434
This bag is for corpses.

44
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:30,437
Yes, but when
I opened the zipper

45
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:34,241
she went into a
violent paroxysm.

46
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,287
(gasping for air)

47
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,257
(frenetic instrumental music)

48
00:09:56,063 --> 00:10:01,268
(moves to suspense
instrumental music)

49
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,717
What's wrong with her?

50
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:27,194
Anna, this is a vampire.

51
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,163
A vampire?

52
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,532
Impossible!

53
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:37,370
You'll see when
the sun goes down.

54
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:45,312
(gasping for air)
(frenetic instrumental music)

55
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,515
Where am I?

56
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,517
Please, don't be afraid.

57
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,385
We want to help you.

58
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,388
I am Doctor Lazar. Anna.

59
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,924
This is Doctor Nicolescu.

60
00:10:56,924 --> 00:11:00,493
You were in a terrible
accident in an Embassy car

61
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,661
with a man and two women.

62
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,130
My sister.

63
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,331
Becky.

64
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,666
Where is she?

65
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:11,404
I'm sorry but...
she did not survive.

66
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,278
No!

67
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:21,248
Aah! Turn it off!

68
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:26,353
(Michelle screams in pain)

69
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,458
Anna: Please!

70
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,828
Can you tell us what happened?

71
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:47,174
This poor child
has been ravaged by a vampire.

72
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,410
A vampire?

73
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,045
I don't believe it.

74
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,715
Can you tell us his name?

75
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,352
Radu Vladislas.

76
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:03,924
Radu Vladislas is a
figment of folklore.

77
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:07,995
Tell me trust worthy child,

78
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:12,900
have you tasted blood?

79
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:14,802
Yes.

80
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:16,436
Nicolescu: Don't be ashamed.

81
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,405
I can help you.

82
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:23,343
Is the symptoms of this
terrible affliction.

83
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,846
You can't help me.

84
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,748
No one can.

85
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,651
I'm already dead.

86
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,321
You are not dead.

87
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:39,092
You're suffering from
an ancient malady.

88
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,629
There is hope for
you if you will agree

89
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:46,499
to stay with us a while.

90
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:52,372
Let me devise at
reatment for you.

91
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,241
(foreign language)

92
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:16,930
We want to help you but you
must cooperate completely.

93
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,731
I'll use them bonds

94
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,535
if you promise to
behave yourself.

95
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,373
Yes! Please!

96
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:37,317
You must be completely
honest with us.

97
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,354
You were initiated by
Radu Vladislas, correct?

98
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,256
Yes.

99
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:46,059
Where is Radu now?

100
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,129
I don't know
but he'll find me!

101
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:52,599
He won't let me get away!

102
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:57,604
(shivering instrumental music)

103
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,931
Nicolescu: Don't be afraid.

104
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,900
A vampire must be invited

105
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:32,105
or it cannot enter
sacred ground.

106
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:38,445
This clinic was
once a monastery.

107
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:42,482
Radu cannot enter here.

108
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,218
You are safe from him

109
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:50,057
as long as you stay
within these walls.

110
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:55,262
Tell me something, does
Radu have the Bloodstone?

111
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,898
Yes.

112
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:03,303
Have you tasted a bit?

113
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,638
Yes.

114
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,175
What is this Bloodstone?

115
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:12,946
It's an ancient relic,
revered among the vampires.

116
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:18,151
A crystal said to drip with
the blood of the saints.

117
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,053
According to legend,

118
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,090
a vampire who has the Bloodstone

119
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,060
can survive without killing.

120
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,262
It's true, yes?

121
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,465
Yes.

122
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:33,933
But there's a dark
side to its power.

123
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,403
It's driving Radu mad!

124
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:37,537
This is crazy.

125
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,207
We're scientists, Anna.

126
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,276
We must keep an open mind.

127
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,146
If the Bloodstone exists,

128
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:50,417
it would be a precious
object for search.

129
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:54,954
You are not the first
vampire to seek my help.

130
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:59,926
I will do my best to
ease your suffering.

131
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:05,698
If it becomes necessary to
take some blood, believe me,

132
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:16,176
there is no reason
to be ashamed.

133
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:21,381
I can provide blood for you.

134
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:25,452
It's not a problem.

135
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,454
Please.

136
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,375
(sobbing)

137
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,677
Do not despair.

138
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:56,083
In time I can free you
of this terrible desire.

139
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,353
(phone rings)

140
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,092
(phone rings)

141
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,763
(foreign language)

142
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:14,234
Detective Voda?

143
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,638
(foreign language)

144
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,914
The police wants to
ask me some questions.

145
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:30,317
Please!
Don't tell them about me!

146
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:35,522
Don't be afraid,
you're secret is safe with us.

147
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:45,265
(menacing instrumental music)

148
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:17,797
(echoing footsteps)

149
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:38,185
(menacing instrumental music)

150
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:56,736
(door creaking)

151
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,971
Ash, my child.

152
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,007
Master!

153
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,677
I seek sanctuary.

154
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,746
Oh, dinner.

155
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:43,316
It's yours to share.

156
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:51,291
I am Radu Vladislas.

157
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,193
I am Serena.

158
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:59,198
She is my protegee, master.

159
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,068
Extraordinarily clinching.

160
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:04,337
Ash: Sit.

161
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:09,409
Take blood with us.

162
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:31,464
What brings you to
Bucharest, master?

163
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,638
Vengeance.

164
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:42,975
Vengeance, master?

165
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,744
Against who?

166
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,848
Fledgling who spurns me.

167
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:52,251
We will help you, master,

168
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,423
to haze in your safe
return to Transylvania.

169
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:04,564
Our wealth has multiplied.

170
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:10,169
It is easy to profit from
the corruption of mortals.

171
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,571
The casino and brothel

172
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:15,241
keeps us well
supplied with income.

173
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:18,110
And victims.

174
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:22,649
I'd grow an old
man in Transylvania.

175
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:28,455
Perhaps I will stay in Buchare
stand reclaim my old things.

176
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,459
As you desire.

177
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:35,428
I require a resting place.

178
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:40,199
The seventh level is
off limits to you.

179
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,435
From this day forth.

180
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:45,838
The seven level is in ruins.

181
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:51,043
There is better lodging
in the Western quarter.

182
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:55,648
The seventh level pleases me.

183
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,950
As you wish.

184
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:02,288
I can provide a willing
mortal for your pleasure.

185
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:05,324
I normally ask ten
thousand for night,

186
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,061
but to you it is a courtesy.

187
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:13,500
You can do anything
you want with them.

188
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,536
Short of the guilt.

189
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:23,943
(suspense instrumental music)

190
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:29,449
I will amuse myself
with your protegee.

191
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,173
Detective Voda?

192
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:55,041
Yeah.

193
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:56,242
I'm Anna Lazar.

194
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:59,278
This is my colleague,
Doctor Nicolescu.

195
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:01,213
Thanks for seeing me, Doctor.

196
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,416
I have just a few questions.

197
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,951
The victims were in Transylvania

198
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,454
searching for a
young American woman,

199
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:10,490
sister of the woman
killed in the wreck.

200
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,059
Was there anyone else?

201
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,763
Any cars or people nearby?

202
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:20,066
No, there was no one else.

203
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,402
Why did you leave the
scene of the accident?

204
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,972
I waited quite
some time, detective.

205
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:27,139
Where were you?

206
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:30,677
I had, other business.

207
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:33,780
There was nothing I
could do for the victims.

208
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,949
I have patient
shere waiting for me.

209
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,118
There was a man whose
job was to follow them,

210
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:40,286
a colleague of mine.

211
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:43,490
And pursuit an stolen artifact.

212
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,793
Lieutenant Marin of
Bucharest police.

213
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:59,772
(screams in pain)

214
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:31,838
(car engine)

215
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:18,945
My master fears you,
Vladislas.

216
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:22,615
But I'm not afraid.

217
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:30,389
Ash is wise to fear me.

218
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,491
He sees to the
stronghold from me

219
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:36,362
and return mortal to grave war.

220
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:46,105
I knew you'd fear me too

221
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,079
because I'm a monster.

222
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:58,818
(mysterious instrumental music)

223
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:21,240
Serena: Destroy
Ash for me, Vladislas.

224
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,945
He keeps me imprisoned
here, in this din of evil.

225
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:30,950
It is forbidden to
destroy our kindred.

226
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,387
You could reclaim
your stronghold.

227
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,457
Rule over Bucharest.

228
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:43,462
You are diabolical, Serena.

229
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:49,702
Do you desire to taste
the blood of the saints?

230
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:58,577
Yes, but I'm frightened.

231
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:03,750
I'll let you drink if
you promise to serve me.

232
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:11,590
I'm yours, master.

233
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:16,796
(feverish instrumental music)

234
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:39,318
Poison, child,
to support an elixir.

235
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:55,968
(choking)

236
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,603
What's wrong with her?

237
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:59,238
Is the down of the urges,

238
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:03,275
the vampire limbers to a
state of his every death.

239
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:07,746
Please, kill me.

240
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:12,618
I can't go on like this.

241
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:16,823
Give us a chance to
help you, Michelle.

242
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:27,099
I'm sorry, but I must
draw some blood from you

243
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:31,037
in this moment of surrender.

244
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:37,076
(mysterious instrumental music)

245
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:58,097
I'll put my laboratory to
work on this immediately.

246
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:02,034
We'll be safe here,
whether it's in dark,

247
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:05,171
no light will penetrate.

248
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:10,342
Tonight we'll begin
your treatment.

249
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:22,154
(footsteps)

250
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,324
I apologize
for doubting you, Ion.

251
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,126
Can you really help her?

252
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:30,930
I can listen the urgency
of her of compassion.

253
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:35,167
Make it possible for her
to move about in daylight,

254
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:40,106
but she will always
be a vampire.

255
00:30:40,106 --> 00:30:42,508
Let's rest a few hours.

256
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:47,446
If this child is the
fledgling of Radu Vladislas,

257
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:50,716
Radu will come to us.

258
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:54,153
We must be ready to meet him.

259
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,525
(mysterious instrumental music)

260
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,479
Please, sit.

261
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:54,546
This will help you to relax.

262
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:55,914
(foreign language)

263
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,417
Cheers.

264
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,887
What's happened to you, Nicu?

265
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:05,391
You've gained there
putation of a charlatan.

266
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:11,197
My anti-aging treatment
sare quite effective, Anna.

267
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:15,467
Even if they are dismissed
by my former colleagues.

268
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:19,205
Patients come to me
from around the world.

269
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:21,073
How much do rock stars pay you

270
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:24,143
to fit all the heroine
from their blood?

271
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:28,947
More than your friends at
the Academy could in lifetime.

272
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,985
It's sad to see you
wasting your talents, Ion.

273
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,954
Have a drink, Anna.

274
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,656
(foreign language)

275
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:40,559
This will help you to relax.

276
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,096
Cheers.

277
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:52,471
Anna, you are more beautiful
now than you were then.

278
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:58,110
Don't try to flirt with me
with superficial cliches, Ion.

279
00:32:58,244 --> 00:33:00,246
I'm a grown woman now.

280
00:33:00,246 --> 00:33:05,417
I regret sometimes how
our love story ended.

281
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:09,288
It was not a love story, Ion.

282
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,723
And it ended as it began,

283
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:15,527
with you seducing
on your student.

284
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,563
I beg your pardon.

285
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:20,066
It was you who seduced me.

286
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:23,702
It was a silly misadventure.

287
00:33:27,473 --> 00:33:30,076
I'm so tired.

288
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:34,246
Wake me in a few hours.

289
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:47,293
(tense instrumental music)

290
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,110
Forgive me, Anna.

291
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:08,147
But I find you...

292
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,584
irresistible.

293
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:22,194
(menacing instrumental music)

294
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:25,417
Any word from
Lieutenant Marin?

295
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:26,151
No, sir.

296
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:27,085
We checked his apartment.

297
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,588
He hasn't been there for days.

298
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,538
(foreign language)

299
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,814
Lieutenant Marin.

300
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:58,784
Lieutenant Marin!

301
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:01,353
Have you been
drinking, Lieutenant?

302
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:04,189
I, I don't know.

303
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,957
I'm sick.

304
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,859
I don't know what's happened.

305
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:11,597
You were supposed to
spy on the Americans.

306
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:16,568
Now everyone is dead, and
you're drunk in the tub!

307
00:37:16,702 --> 00:37:19,004
Mel Thompson from
Embassy is dead?

308
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:22,508
I had to go out to Stirbei
in the middle of the night

309
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:23,975
to question a witness.

310
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,110
It's your case!

311
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,879
It is you who
should do the work!

312
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:32,117
One more mistake Lieutenant
and you are fired!

313
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:37,823
(tense instrumental music)

314
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,348
(foreign language)

315
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:21,026
If she drank
from the Bloodstone,

316
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:23,729
we should find someone
with unusual sequences

317
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:26,064
in the DNA.

318
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:29,367
Find the Bloodstone's DNA,

319
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,439
and we may find the
secret to eternal youth.

320
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:38,444
Ion, are we trying
to cure this girl?

321
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,846
Or use her for our search?

322
00:39:40,846 --> 00:39:46,051
We have sent a simple
masquerade in us doctors.

323
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:49,354
The most important thing

324
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:54,526
is to gain position
of the Bloodstone.

325
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,135
Anna, Anna.

326
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,004
Wake up.

327
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:06,972
What time is it?

328
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:09,407
There is something
I want to show you.

329
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:13,178
Our patient will be waking soon.

330
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,490
What's this?

331
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,860
Some lamps
from our taming zone,

332
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,129
tweaking him.

333
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:36,568
Holy water bottled by
the monks of Lake Borgo,

334
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:42,207
who by the way make an
excellent complement.

335
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,912
Stakes

336
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:50,448
to pierce his heart.

337
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,585
If Radu Vladislas comes
to claim his protegee,

338
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:56,588
we must be ready to
defend ourselves.

339
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:58,590
You said he cannot enter here.

340
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:03,762
Yes, but the girl
was invited in by me.

341
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:08,967
Is as great a threat
to us as Radu.

342
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,435
This is barbaric.

343
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:13,471
I won't let you drive
a stake into her heart.

344
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:18,677
If it comes necessary
you won't try to stop me.

345
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:25,517
(suspense instrumental music)

346
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:50,576
Take me into
the grave night, master.

347
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,581
Teach me the mysteries.

348
00:41:56,314 --> 00:42:01,653
Ash does not appreciate
the pleasure of the hunt.

349
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:08,560
Return to you master,
you're not my fledgling.

350
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:19,004
(suspense instrumental music)

351
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,176
We must destroy him, master.

352
00:42:58,176 --> 00:43:00,578
He is evil incarnate.

353
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,683
Do not meddle in
his affairs, Serena.

354
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:06,417
He is insane.

355
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:10,188
He possesses
the Bloodstone.

356
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:14,693
The Bloodstone?

357
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:16,862
Are you sure?

358
00:43:16,862 --> 00:43:21,232
We can destroy him and
claim it for ourselves.

359
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:28,239
Radu is my master, Serena.

360
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:31,076
But he's not mine.

361
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:35,380
It will give me pleasure
to watch him suffer.

362
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:42,087
You are no match for him.

363
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:47,292
We must find a mortal with
the will to destroy him.

364
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:55,767
(door creaking)

365
00:44:00,038 --> 00:44:05,243
(menacing instrumental music)

366
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:19,657
Here is the key to
the grave night.

367
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,526
Follow him.

368
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:24,595
Discover his intentions.

369
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:27,365
Yes, master.

370
00:44:32,537 --> 00:44:35,741
(door creaking)

371
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:42,113
(crickets chirping)

372
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:58,096
(suspense instrumental music)

373
00:45:07,672 --> 00:45:12,878
(door knocking)

374
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,482
Marin: Hey! Help!

375
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:19,350
Help me!

376
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,452
Somebody hears me?

377
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,621
Hey!

378
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:27,158
Hey!

379
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:29,027
Somebody hear me!

380
00:45:29,027 --> 00:45:31,462
Hey!

381
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,965
Ah!

382
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,203
Come to me, pretty one.

383
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:46,011
Your time has come
to serve your master.

384
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:51,216
Now, tell me,
where's my fledgling?

385
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,584
I don't know!

386
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,620
I swear to you!

387
00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:00,058
But at Stirbeit
here is a witness!

388
00:46:00,058 --> 00:46:01,259
Yes!

389
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,229
- Stirbei?
- Yes!

390
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:09,500
(tense instrumental music)

391
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,377
The first stage
of treatment

392
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:23,348
is to draw all the
blood from your body.

393
00:46:23,348 --> 00:46:28,353
Purify and filter it,
and replace it one again.

394
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:33,558
I predict we should see
some immediate improvement.

395
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,696
It's necessary for us to work

396
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:41,399
while you are fully conscious.

397
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:42,400
And so they backed

398
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,905
through there maybe some discomfort.

399
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:53,278
(screaming in pain)

400
00:46:55,080 --> 00:47:00,251
(suspense instrumental music)

401
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,198
You are Radu's pretty one.

402
00:47:13,198 --> 00:47:16,167
No, no!

403
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:18,436
No!

404
00:47:21,106 --> 00:47:26,111
No!

405
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:36,387
(suspense instrumental music)

406
00:48:11,156 --> 00:48:13,925
All signs are stable.

407
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:15,726
Excellent.

408
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,295
Tell me.

409
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:21,466
She has survived
the first tribulation.

410
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:24,902
How do you feel, Michelle?

411
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:28,706
I feel peaceful.

412
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:31,042
This is a good sign.

413
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:36,247
But don't be surprised if
the benefit is temporary.

414
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:43,054
I am Radu Vladislas.

415
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:44,289
This is a private route.

416
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:45,991
What is your business here?

417
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:50,996
I demand an audience with
the master of this house.

418
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:54,699
Doctor, there is
a man outside

419
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:56,634
insistent to speak with you.

420
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:59,937
His name is Radu Vladislas.

421
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,372
He's come for me!

422
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:03,408
Niculescu: Please!

423
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:04,842
Try to remain calm.

424
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:08,679
There is no way
he can enter here.

425
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:12,017
Lupu, the sedative.

426
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:19,024
(anxious instrumental music)

427
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:34,039
I am obligated to
speak with him.

428
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:40,178
(trembling instrumental music)

429
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:50,088
Radu Vladislas.

430
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:54,859
I'm Doctor Ion Niculescu.

431
00:49:54,859 --> 00:49:59,364
You hold my child
against her will?

432
00:49:59,364 --> 00:50:02,633
She's in pain and cries
for my protection.

433
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:05,603
Let me cross your threshold.

434
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:07,605
No, Vladislas.

435
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:09,440
You are not welcome here.

436
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,478
Release here to me and
I should leave in peace.

437
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:18,683
Deny me and I will lay
your souls to waste.

438
00:50:19,084 --> 00:50:22,253
She begged for sanctuary.

439
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:25,323
She wish she is to
be mortal again.

440
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:28,593
She wishes for the impossible.

441
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:30,395
She belongs to me.

442
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:31,262
No!

443
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:33,098
She's in my care now.

444
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:36,234
Leave her alone or
I'll call the police!

445
00:50:36,234 --> 00:50:41,139
Challenge me at
your own peril.

446
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,774
Like the lighting.

447
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:47,645
Such diversions.

448
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:50,681
I'll be siege you.

449
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:52,217
Open your gate to me!

450
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:57,222
Do you possess the Bloodstone?

451
00:50:57,322 --> 00:51:02,093
The Bloodstone
is my birth right.

452
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:07,198
Who came before you?

453
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:11,669
Ash, the music lover.

454
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:14,939
I am before Ash.

455
00:51:14,939 --> 00:51:18,743
Please, Vladislas.

456
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:21,312
Let me see it.

457
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:26,317
Give me a few drops
of its essence

458
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:28,986
in the name of science.

459
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:31,956
I have lived a thousand years.

460
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:36,227
Witnessed the progress of man.

461
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:41,432
I have a weak spot in my
heart for the sciences.

462
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:48,206
Open your gate and I will
give you three drops.

463
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:55,012
But I warn you, Doctor,

464
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:58,149
the mysteries of the Bloodstone

465
00:51:58,149 --> 00:52:02,187
cannot be illuminated
by science.

466
00:52:02,387 --> 00:52:05,055
(suspense instrumental music)

467
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:05,690
Anna: No!

468
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:06,524
No, Ion!

469
00:52:06,524 --> 00:52:07,492
Are you crazy?

470
00:52:07,492 --> 00:52:09,627
You promised to protect us!

471
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,996
No! Please, no!

472
00:52:11,996 --> 00:52:13,998
Don't do this! Ion!

473
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:16,301
No, Ion! Please!

474
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:20,070
Don't let him! No, Ion!

475
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:25,276
(vibrant instrumental music)

476
00:52:29,414 --> 00:52:31,782
Master!

477
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:38,256
(vibrant instrumental music)

478
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:05,250
You are powerless before me!

479
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:08,319
Get down on your knees!

480
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,288
Give me the Bloodstone!

481
00:53:10,288 --> 00:53:12,423
The Bloodstone now!

482
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:15,960
You won't return
a daylight for this!

483
00:53:16,961 --> 00:53:21,966
(overcome instrumental music)

484
00:53:22,066 --> 00:53:23,701
Set me free!

485
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:24,935
My master needs me!

486
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:27,738
The sedative! Quickly!

487
00:53:28,072 --> 00:53:33,278
(tense instrumental music)

488
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:37,282
(scream)

489
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,255
Stay away from me!

490
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:50,995
(anxious instrumental music)

491
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:54,565
I'm sorry
to give you such a shock,

492
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:58,503
but it was necessary to
dissect him for the trap.

493
00:53:58,503 --> 00:54:00,405
Will he die like this?

494
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:04,475
The stake is the first step.

495
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:07,177
The vampire cannot move.

496
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:11,015
Next we have two choices:

497
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:13,217
cut off his head,

498
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:17,422
which should be too
merciful for Radu.

499
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:20,891
Or leave it to agonize

500
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:26,297
until the Sun comes up
and renders it to dust.

501
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,767
Michelle: Master!

502
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:32,970
No!

503
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:36,140
Michelle, go back inside!

504
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,242
I beg you to destroy me.

505
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:39,410
No, Michelle!

506
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,945
You are free of him.

507
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,613
Vadislas is dying.

508
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:46,317
No!

509
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:54,291
(overcome instrumental music)

510
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:58,363
Radu: Michelle.

511
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:03,434
My blood runs within you.

512
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:10,708
What's beat us one.

513
00:55:12,677 --> 00:55:14,011
Stand away!

514
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:16,080
Do not touch him!

515
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:19,316
Michelle, get away from him!

516
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:24,054
Save me and I'll allow
to set you free.

517
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:29,927
(tense instrumental music)

518
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:43,173
Now, prove yourself fledgling.

519
00:55:43,474 --> 00:55:47,144
Let there be a bloodbath.

520
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:50,214
I saved you life, Radu.

521
00:55:50,214 --> 00:55:54,051
I've earned my freedom.

522
00:55:58,523 --> 00:56:03,694
You will pay forthis in suffering.

523
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:10,835
(menacing instrumental music)

524
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:16,273
(foreign language)

525
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:21,011
You wish to destroy
Radu Vladislas.

526
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:23,113
Who are you?

527
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:26,083
A kindred spirit.

528
00:56:26,451 --> 00:56:29,286
Done to ravage.

529
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,790
I will tell you where
he sleeps if you promise

530
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:37,628
to destroy him before
this day is done.

531
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:40,030
Where does he sleep?

532
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,398
Tell us.

533
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,034
Not you.

534
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:47,271
You must destroy him.

535
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:50,207
Me? Why?

536
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:55,145
Because you wish the save
the life of Radu's fledgling.

537
00:56:55,145 --> 00:57:00,485
They sleep in Belus Cemetary,
but two of Vladislas.

538
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:06,156
From the year of 1875.

539
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:10,828
Here is the key.

540
00:57:10,828 --> 00:57:13,130
The sarcophagus
takes you underground

541
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,566
to the ancient city.

542
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:20,771
Go south, down seven staircases.

543
00:57:22,507 --> 00:57:27,712
There you will find
Radu's resting place.

544
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:34,585
You are one pretty one.

545
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:39,123
You have the passion to prevail.

546
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:43,594
Surprise him while he sleeps.

547
00:57:43,594 --> 00:57:47,064
Drive a stake through his heart.

548
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:49,767
Cut off his head.

549
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:53,938
Take it back the way you came.

550
00:57:56,974 --> 00:58:00,144
Do not hesitate

551
00:58:00,745 --> 00:58:04,214
or explore the elaborately.

552
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:07,151
Go quickly to the sunlight

553
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:12,156
and render Radu's head to dust.

554
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:19,063
(mysterious instrumental music)

555
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,642
(foreign language)

556
00:58:52,797 --> 00:58:58,002
(tense instrumental music)

557
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:10,180
Buy yourself a new one.

558
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:16,954
(bell rings)

559
00:59:19,023 --> 00:59:24,028
(bell rings)

560
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:30,034
(religious piano music)

561
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:53,090
(foreign language)

562
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,470
(menacing instrumental music)

563
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,239
(foreign language)

564
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:23,420
(menacing instrumental music)

565
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,655
(foreign language)

566
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:35,065
(frightening instrumental music)

567
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,015
Michelle?

568
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:54,251
I can save you from this torment

569
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:58,055
if you come to me of
your own free will.

570
01:00:58,055 --> 01:00:59,724
Never.

571
01:00:59,724 --> 01:01:02,927
Will we share my sanctuary?

572
01:01:02,927 --> 01:01:07,131
The sacred mysteries?

573
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:12,336
Drink of the Bloodstone.

574
01:01:19,643 --> 01:01:24,849
I'm your master,
you cannot deny me!

575
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:27,651
Stefan was my master.

576
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:32,522
Stefan infected you
with his tragic weakness.

577
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:37,327
His love for mortals.

578
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:41,398
But Stefan was much more,

579
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:44,501
and he's dust!

580
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:47,337
So you are mine!

581
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:53,110
(trembling instrumental music)

582
01:02:00,918 --> 01:02:06,123
(suspense instrumental music)

583
01:03:27,037 --> 01:03:30,941
Your powers have reborn.

584
01:03:30,941 --> 01:03:36,146
But your weakness
threatens to destroy you.

585
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:41,318
Michelle,

586
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:47,157
I know your despair.

587
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,994
Surrender your ties to mortality

588
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:55,199
and all your pain
will disappear.

589
01:03:56,033 --> 01:04:01,171
(tense instrumental music)

590
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:29,466
Tomorrow, master,

591
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:35,472
when the Sun is high,
Vladislas will be dust.

592
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:41,445
You are a never ending
source of joy to me, Serena.

593
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,814
How will the deed be done?

594
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:49,653
I found a mortal with
the will to destroy him.

595
01:04:50,254 --> 01:04:54,558
You conspired with a mortal?

596
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:58,862
I gave her the key
to Vladislas tomb.

597
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:03,667
You endangered us, Serena.

598
01:05:03,968 --> 01:05:07,037
Fear not, master.

599
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:10,574
I sabotaged the mechanism.

600
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:14,644
The key works from the outside

601
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:18,148
but it's broken from within.

602
01:05:18,148 --> 01:05:22,252
She will destroy
Vladislas for us

603
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:26,323
and be trapped in the labyrinth.

604
01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:31,695
And when the Sunsets
we can ravish her

605
01:05:31,996 --> 01:05:35,799
and seize the Bloodstone.

606
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:38,535
I am diabolical.

607
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:42,439
Aren't I , master?

608
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:45,575
Serena, you are sublime.

609
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:49,679
There is ones
mall complication, master.

610
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,448
Complication?

611
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:55,619
She's in league
with Doctor Blood.

612
01:05:57,687 --> 01:05:58,788
Today?

613
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,558
No, of the Bloodstone?

614
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:04,128
Yes, Doctor Blood tried to

615
01:06:04,128 --> 01:06:06,696
steal it from Radu.

616
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:09,233
But tell me master,

617
01:06:09,233 --> 01:06:13,237
if the Doctor is descended
from our bloodline,

618
01:06:13,237 --> 01:06:17,507
how is it he can
stand in the light

619
01:06:17,507 --> 01:06:22,212
and touch holy water
with his bare hands?

620
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:27,417
He spawned from
our blood, Serena.

621
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:33,523
But he's altered
himself with science.

622
01:06:34,024 --> 01:06:36,460
Ash, my child.

623
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,595
Master.

624
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,999
Henceforth I claim
all the profits

625
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,869
from your well-being
and surprises.

626
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:47,871
But master!

627
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:53,343
I've netted to the holdings
for a hundred years.

628
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:57,481
I have earned your generosity.

629
01:06:57,481 --> 01:06:59,883
I generously give
you until full moon

630
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:02,552
to evacuate my stronghold.

631
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:07,757
You and your fledglings
must find a new sanctuary.

632
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:14,364
(tense instrumental music)

633
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:20,104
The blade of Laertes.

634
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:27,444
The vampire slayer is mine.

635
01:07:29,946 --> 01:07:35,152
(tense instrumental music)

636
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:39,123
Radu: You stole it from me, Ash.

637
01:07:39,123 --> 01:07:41,725
And then black played.

638
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:46,029
You cannot force me, Radu.

639
01:07:46,096 --> 01:07:49,399
You are not my master.

640
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:54,671
You amuse me,

641
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:57,341
Serena.

642
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:03,147
You know my stay.

643
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:09,085
(anxious instrumental music)

644
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,667
Your ravage is
yielding, fledgling.

645
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:28,004
I can see the
darkening in your eyes.

646
01:08:28,472 --> 01:08:33,677
You're memories of mortality
will fade like a sweet dream.

647
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:41,185
Your mind forever more.

648
01:08:41,918 --> 01:08:47,123
(anxious instrumental music)

649
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:57,834
Niculescu: We should
rest until daylight.

650
01:08:57,834 --> 01:09:00,304
You have a difficult task ahead.

651
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:03,740
Thank you
for helping me, Ion.

652
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:08,478
You don't have to thank me.

653
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:12,816
(echoing) You drugged me.

654
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:14,884
(glass breaking)

655
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:20,757
(frenetic instrumental music)

656
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:28,465
(moves to slowed suspense
instrumental music)

657
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:36,340
(echoing footsteps)

658
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:24,954
(moves to trembling
instrumental music)

659
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:28,124
Anna!

660
01:10:28,124 --> 01:10:29,559
Help! Help! Someone!

661
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:30,894
Help me! Help me, please!

662
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:32,296
- Stop it, Anna!
- Help me!

663
01:10:32,296 --> 01:10:33,229
Anna, stop it!

664
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,998
Anna!

665
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:37,066
- Please, listen.
- No!

666
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,568
You're a vampire.

667
01:10:38,568 --> 01:10:41,305
I'm not a vampire,
I'm human too.

668
01:10:41,305 --> 01:10:43,440
You must listen to Ion.

669
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,108
Please, listen to me.

670
01:10:45,108 --> 01:10:47,344
I didn't choose to be a vampire.

671
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:49,679
It was forced upon me.

672
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:50,780
You're a murderer!

673
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:55,985
No, I drink only
to sustain my life.

674
01:10:56,653 --> 01:11:01,090
The woman you saw is
a willing partner.

675
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:04,328
Please, believe me!

676
01:11:04,328 --> 01:11:07,397
I curses this fate!

677
01:11:07,397 --> 01:11:12,268
Each day I pray to God
to make me mortal again.

678
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:16,540
To be feel the warmth of
the sand upon my face.

679
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:21,745
To let me survive one night
without the urge for blood.

680
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:26,850
Radu must be destroyed, Anna.

681
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:30,720
By a mortal saint.

682
01:11:32,656 --> 01:11:34,257
Why me?

683
01:11:34,257 --> 01:11:35,892
Why not Lupu?

684
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:36,960
He's a mortal too.

685
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,295
I'm a mere surgeon,
not a vampire hunter.

686
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,864
Trust me, Anna.

687
01:11:40,864 --> 01:11:43,500
I promise to help you.

688
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:50,306
(hopeful instrumental music)

689
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,174
Where is the body bag?

690
01:11:51,174 --> 01:11:53,777
I have it here.

691
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:59,783
If we are lucky, I can
find Radu's resting place.

692
01:11:59,783 --> 01:12:02,051
It may be necessary
to kill her too

693
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:06,390
if she is too deep in
Radu's control to be saved.

694
01:12:06,756 --> 01:12:07,691
No.

695
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:10,059
With the Bloodstone
she has a chance.

696
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:11,528
We must find a way
for both of you

697
01:12:11,528 --> 01:12:14,764
to sharing its benefits.

698
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,033
Thank you, Anna.

699
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:22,171
Bullets are powerless
against a vampire.

700
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,508
Even so, the mere
sense of security

701
01:12:24,508 --> 01:12:27,944
is better than no
security at all.

702
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:33,550
(suspense instrumental music)

703
01:12:41,157 --> 01:12:42,325
Niculescu: Dammit!

704
01:12:42,325 --> 01:12:43,993
We don't have time for this.

705
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:45,395
(foreign language)

706
01:12:45,395 --> 01:12:47,096
Show me respect for the dead.

707
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:49,065
I'm one of the dead people,

708
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:52,068
so don't tell me what to do.

709
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,442
It's afternoon already.

710
01:12:58,442 --> 01:13:00,343
Isn't there another way in?

711
01:13:00,343 --> 01:13:03,680
This is the only way.

712
01:13:08,017 --> 01:13:13,022
(suspense instrumental music)

713
01:13:27,437 --> 01:13:32,642
Look for a tomb inscribed
Vladislas, 1875.

714
01:13:33,977 --> 01:13:36,680
Anna, go that way.

715
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,215
I'll search back here.

716
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:41,618
Lupu, behind the church.

717
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:45,388
We rendezvous here
in one hour, yes?

718
01:13:45,388 --> 01:13:47,824
Anna: Okay.

719
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:53,963
(suspense instrumental music)

720
01:14:51,888 --> 01:14:53,122
Ion!

721
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:54,524
Ion!

722
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:55,959
Ion, I found it!

723
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:56,993
Good.

724
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,696
Let's go to work.

725
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:09,105
(uneasy instrumental music)

726
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,344
You keep the key.

727
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:19,048
Open the door
when you hear us calling.

728
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:20,650
Don't worry.

729
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:22,518
I'll be waiting.

730
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,453
If we are not
out at nightfall,

731
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:27,591
send for the police.

732
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:34,063
(suspense instrumental music)

733
01:15:56,452 --> 01:16:00,489
One hour and 30
minutes until sunset.

734
01:16:00,857 --> 01:16:03,192
You are frightened, yes?

735
01:16:03,192 --> 01:16:05,829
Yes.

736
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:12,035
(suspense instrumental music)

737
01:16:17,373 --> 01:16:19,008
What is this place?

738
01:16:19,008 --> 01:16:22,612
The ancient city
beneath the city.

739
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:29,118
(suspense instrumental music)

740
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:39,629
Anna: We must
be 300 feet down.

741
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:43,800
Niculescu: I think
we are almost there.

742
01:16:45,969 --> 01:16:51,174
(suspense instrumental music)

743
01:17:54,871 --> 01:17:56,139
Ah!

744
01:17:59,042 --> 01:18:03,179
You'll make a pretty plaything.

745
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,014
Ah!

746
01:18:06,082 --> 01:18:09,118
(Radu screaming)

747
01:18:12,822 --> 01:18:18,027
(trembling instrumental music)

748
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:20,163
Michelle!

749
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:25,835
(trembling instrumental music)

750
01:18:25,935 --> 01:18:30,139
She's yours, Vladislas.

751
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:35,912
I brought her for you as
a gesture of good will.

752
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:37,380
Ah!

753
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:41,017
No!

754
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:45,721
That's right! Struggle!

755
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:48,257
Fear me, child!

756
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:53,462
Fear is such a really
neat to do to the blood.

757
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,733
Oh, Doctor.

758
01:18:58,167 --> 01:19:02,939
You want a tasteof the Bloodstone?

759
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:19,956
(increasingly suspense
instrumental music)

760
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:21,490
Ah!

761
01:19:28,631 --> 01:19:33,436
(owl hooting)

762
01:19:36,906 --> 01:19:38,808
(foreign language)

763
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,282
(crickets chirping)

764
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:47,550
Anna: Lupu!

765
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:50,253
Help me, Lupu!

766
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:56,125
(tense instrumental music)

767
01:19:56,692 --> 01:19:59,662
Why are you here?

768
01:19:59,662 --> 01:20:02,198
Alone at night?

769
01:20:02,198 --> 01:20:06,669
I'm praying for the departed.

770
01:20:06,669 --> 01:20:08,537
For a lost one.

771
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:11,841
Don't lie to me, mortal.

772
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:16,612
The key in your
hand belongs to me.

773
01:20:16,612 --> 01:20:18,982
No!

774
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,051
Ah!

775
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:31,327
(anxious instrumental music)

776
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:34,130
Anna: Lupu! Doctor Lupu!

777
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:36,232
Doctor Lupu, Doctor Lupu!

778
01:20:36,232 --> 01:20:39,735
Please, help! Please,
open the door!

779
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,570
Ah!

780
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:45,008
Can't you just save me?

781
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:52,916
(frightening instrumental music)

782
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,858
What do you want from me?

783
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:05,161
Your life blood.

784
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:08,797
This thing which
allows us to impulse

785
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:11,367
of my fledglings' humanity.

786
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:13,202
Anna: No!

787
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:15,171
Michelle!

788
01:21:15,671 --> 01:21:17,373
(suspense instrumental music)

789
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:19,042
Surrender child!

790
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:22,078
And I'll have mercy,
chance be in your life

791
01:21:22,078 --> 01:21:24,948
will be an ever
lasting torment.

792
01:21:24,948 --> 01:21:29,052
Michelle, help me please!

793
01:21:32,088 --> 01:21:35,158
Reach out with
senses, fledgling.

794
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:38,995
Reveling the perfume of fear.

795
01:21:39,262 --> 01:21:41,597
No, please!

796
01:21:41,597 --> 01:21:43,266
Radu: Drink, fledgling.

797
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:48,071
Pour your sadness in
a whispering of blood.

798
01:21:48,071 --> 01:21:51,607
Michelle, please!

799
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:56,312
Drink, fledgling!

800
01:21:58,014 --> 01:22:00,516
Or I'll ravage her myself

801
01:22:00,516 --> 01:22:04,320
and multiply your
nightmares a thousand forth.

802
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:07,023
Michelle.

803
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:09,558
No!

804
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:14,797
This is a moment of weakness
you will never forget.

805
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,566
Anna: No! No!

806
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:21,137
No! No!

807
01:22:22,972 --> 01:22:28,177
(trembling instrumental music)

808
01:22:41,524 --> 01:22:45,428
(mumbling, gagging)

809
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:53,102
(screaming in pain)

810
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:04,780
(vibrant instrumental music)

811
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:07,750
You can't destroy me.

812
01:23:19,128 --> 01:23:20,696
(iron hitting)

813
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:27,136
(tense instrumental music)

814
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:45,821
It will be dawn soon.

815
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:47,990
Take his head out
into the sunlight.

816
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:51,394
You are coming
with me, Michelle.

817
01:23:52,895 --> 01:23:54,863
He's got the Bloodstone.

818
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:58,167
You're going to be alright now.

819
01:24:05,641 --> 01:24:10,646
(flames burning)

820
01:24:28,231 --> 01:24:32,701
I curse you, Vladislas.

821
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:41,310
(tense instrumental music)

822
01:24:43,946 --> 01:24:45,080
Come on, Michelle.

823
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,081
We have to hurry!

824
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,049
I can't.

825
01:24:47,049 --> 01:24:49,051
The sun is rising.

826
01:24:49,051 --> 01:24:50,953
You have to keep
moving, Michelle.

827
01:24:50,953 --> 01:24:54,457
We have to get you out of here.

828
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:59,762
(tense instrumental music)

829
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:01,664
Michelle: No, please don't.

830
01:25:01,664 --> 01:25:03,532
I can't go on.

831
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:04,933
No!

832
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:08,003
We are almost there.

833
01:25:08,337 --> 01:25:13,542
(tense instrumental music)

834
01:25:14,410 --> 01:25:19,182
Doctor Lupu! Doctor Lupu
open the door, please!

835
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:26,389
Your friend,the doctor, is dead.

836
01:25:26,822 --> 01:25:31,827
(tense instrumental music)

837
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:38,033
Where is the Bloodstone?

838
01:25:38,033 --> 01:25:42,171
Help! Someone help me!

839
01:25:42,171 --> 01:25:45,040
She's a pretty one, master.

840
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,911
The fear is a rare perfume.

841
01:25:49,612 --> 01:25:53,616
Ah! Ah!

842
01:25:54,283 --> 01:25:58,454
Help! Someone help me!

843
01:26:00,022 --> 01:26:01,790
Help!

844
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:03,859
Ah!

845
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:13,902
(vibrant instrumental music)

846
01:26:19,375 --> 01:26:21,644
(Gravekeeper and Anna
screaming at the same type)

847
01:26:23,412 --> 01:26:26,382
Don't move, Michelle!

848
01:26:28,351 --> 01:26:29,685
(foreign language)

849
01:26:34,156 --> 01:26:36,492
(resolution instrumental music)

850
01:26:36,492 --> 01:26:39,695
Michelle: At last, I was in peace.

851
01:26:42,665 --> 01:26:47,803
In time, the Bloodstone yielded
its mysteries to me.

852
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:55,244
Radu Valdislas was returned to dust.

853
01:27:02,485 --> 01:27:07,690
(mysterious instrumental music)
