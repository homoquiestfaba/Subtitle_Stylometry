372
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,264
No

373
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:01,167
Then what am I doing here?

374
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:02,801
You're resting.

375
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:05,437
Here.

376
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,638
Sit closer to me.

377
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:17,683
Ah!

378
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:20,752
That isn't so bad.

379
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:22,688
Your friend is a psychopath.

380
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,624
I don't know why Conner
would do something like this.

381
00:30:25,724 --> 00:30:26,425
Well, he's deranged.

382
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:30,796
Was he good?

383
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:33,065
What do you mean?

384
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,833
Was he good in bed?

385
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:36,068
He was too rough.

386
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:36,869
What?

387
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:38,737
You don't like it rough?

388
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,073
I get it rough all the time.

389
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,276
For once I'd just like someone
to be gentle, you know?

390
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:47,947
I'd just like to
be held for once.

391
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:49,248
Yeah, but your
friend's got problems.

392
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,251
He thinks he's a
vampire or something.

393
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,986
Conner is weird like that.

394
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:54,921
Conner did this to you?

395
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:55,721
Diana.

396
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:56,822
[Screeching sound]

397
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:02,828
EDMOND: How long have
you been standing there?

398
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:04,363
Long enough.

399
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:07,533
The door was wide open... an
open innovation for anyone

400
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:10,102
To just come on in.

401
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,005
You really should
be more careful.

402
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,607
Who is this?

403
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,944
Just a minute, Edmond,
I just want to look.

404
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:18,744
What's your name?

405
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:20,179
Dee.

406
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,748
Well, you're very
beautiful, Dee.

407
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,850
Thank you.

408
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:28,087
Who did this to
your precious neck?

409
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:30,122
I heard the name Conner.

410
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,190
Is that your friend, Edmond?

411
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:31,991
Yep.

412
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:36,295
Conner did this to you?

413
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,131
Yes.

414
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,032
He bit your neck?

415
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,468
Yes.

416
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:43,702
Why?

417
00:31:43,802 --> 00:31:46,538
I don't know.

418
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,408
We were fucking,
and he attacked me.

419
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:50,276
How odd.

420
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:56,148
EDMOND: Diana, what
are you doing here?

421
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,516
My show goes up in
two days, Edmond.

422
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:59,885
You hadn't forgotten, I hope.

423
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:02,254
I painted the woman you
brought by last evening.

424
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,991
I don't have time to be picky.

425
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,758
But I need one more model.

426
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:09,161
Fine, I'll find
you someone today.

427
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,464
No, Edmond, I think
you already have.

428
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,201
You don't have a home?

429
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:17,303
No.

430
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:19,605
And you were having sex with
this Conner fellow for money,

431
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:20,406
I assume?

432
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,377
How would you like to
make some money modeling?

433
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:26,645
DEE: Modeling?
DIANA: Mhm.

434
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:27,446
I'm an artist.

435
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:28,247
I paint women.

436
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:29,815
Really?

437
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,217
I think you have a
very interesting face.

438
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:32,051
I think you'd be perfect.

439
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:34,886
I always wanted to be a model.

440
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:36,388
Then you shall be.

441
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,224
EDMOND: No.

442
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:39,691
Yes, of course you shall.

443
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,659
EDMOND: No, not her.

444
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:49,001
You like this one, Edmond?

445
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:50,836
I'll find you somebody else.

446
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:53,105
She is beautiful.

447
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,073
I'll find you someone today.

448
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:55,674
No, I want her, Edmond.

449
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:57,176
I thought you said you
wanted someone older.

450
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:59,478
Well, that was then.

451
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,413
This is now.

452
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:02,514
What do you want
from me, Diana?

453
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:09,955
Good question, well,
I simply want you.

454
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:11,423
I'll never be with you.

455
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:22,668
Then I will take
everything you have.

456
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:23,669
Why me?

457
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:24,636
Find someone else.

458
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,938
You know why, Edmond.

459
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,674
You're torturing me.

460
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:30,676
If you loved me,
you'd let me go.

461
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:37,083
I can't let you go, Edmond.

462
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:38,550
Now bring her by tonight.

463
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,520
I want to paint her.

464
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,988
No.

465
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:48,560
[Sighs] Saving her soul
isn't going to erase all

466
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,862
Of the sins you've committed.

467
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,831
Your soul is as damned as mine.

468
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,005
You're going to be a model.

469
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:00,806
Would you like that?

470
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:03,075
DEE: Fuck yeah.

471
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:05,644
Have Edmond bring you
by my place in an hour.

472
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:10,782
And bring Conner with you.

473
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,584
I'd like to meet him.

474
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,986
His methods of
seduction intrigue me.

475
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:21,693
DEE: Hey, was that
your girlfriend?

476
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:22,761
No.

477
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:24,563
I'm not like getting
into trouble, am I?

478
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:25,664
Look, where do you live?

479
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:27,966
I don't have a home,
man, I told you that.

480
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,235
But do you have any relatives?

481
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:31,237
I've been on the
street since I was 13.

482
00:34:31,337 --> 00:34:33,071
My parents don't
give a shit about me.

483
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:33,905
Where do they live?

484
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,174
Why do you want to know that?

485
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:36,508
Because I've taken you home.

486
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,710
I'm not going home.

487
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,645
What?

488
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,046
You'd rather live
on the streets?

489
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:42,748
You'd rather fuck people
that you don't even know.

490
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:43,982
What type of life is that?

491
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,318
It's a way better life than
I got waiting back home.

492
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:50,156
Look, I don't know
why you're trying

493
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:53,625
To be Mr. Good Samaritan Eagle
Scout, and I don't give a shit.

494
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:56,262
All I wanted was
$5 to suck you off.

495
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:57,596
Calm down, OK?

496
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,665
Listen, just take me to
your artist friend's house,

497
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,533
And you don't have to
worry about me anymore, OK?

498
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:02,801
I can't do that, all right?

499
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:03,869
Why not?

500
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,937
Look, I'll take you
anywhere but there.

501
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,039
Listen, you heard
what she said.

502
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,040
She wants to paint my picture.

503
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:10,676
I'm going to be a model.

504
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,043
Why do you have a
problem with that?

505
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:13,945
I just do, all right?

506
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,181
Well, tough shit.

507
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,047
Tell me where she lives,
and I'll fucking walk there.

508
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:17,416
No, you're not going anywhere.

509
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:18,350
What?

510
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,252
You heard what I said.

511
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:22,388
Oh, you give me
some clean clothes,

512
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:23,955
And you bandage my wounds.

513
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:25,657
And I'm supposed to do
what tell you tell me?

514
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:26,358
Is that it?

515
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,426
Well, I'm out of here.

516
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:28,594
(ANGRILY) No, you're
not going anywhere.

517
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:31,029
[Drums]

518
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:37,836
I said you're staying here.

519
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,571
You're a fucking crazy
man just like your friend.

520
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:41,039
No, I'm crazier than he is.

521
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,242
If you don't let me out
of here, I'll scream.

522
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,677
If you scream, I'm going
to tape your mouth shut.

523
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:47,279
And I'm going to
tie you to the bed.

524
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:48,947
No you won't.

525
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,148
Oh, yeah?

526
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:50,949
Try it.

527
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:02,261
Now, I don't like doing this.

528
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:05,096
I had a tough time
tying up my dog.

529
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:07,433
But one day I decided
not to tie him up.

530
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:08,467
And he ran out in the street.

531
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,402
And he got hit by a car.

532
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,003
I don't want the same
thing to happen to you.

533
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,640
I mean, I'd hope that you
don't run down the street

534
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,743
And get hit by a car.

535
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:18,777
I like you, Dee.

536
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:19,878
And I don't want to
see you get hurt.

537
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,780
[Mumbling]

538
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,083
You want to say something?

539
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,017
You're not going to scream.

540
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,085
[Mumbling]

541
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,354
Now, got a feeling
you're going to scream.

542
00:36:28,454 --> 00:36:29,154
You're going to scream.

543
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:30,088
[Mumbling]

544
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:31,590
OK.

545
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,629
I'll fuck you if you let me go.

546
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:39,765
Dee, we're not going
to have sex, OK?

547
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:40,566
Why not?

548
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:42,968
Don't you think I'm pretty.

549
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:44,870
I think you're beautiful.

550
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,338
But you'd be only

once she's painted them,

I take their bodies,
and I bury them.

00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:14,479
You know what this is?

733
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:15,814
This is kidnapping.

734
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:16,681
- Dad, look...
- No.

735
00:45:16,782 --> 00:45:17,482
- Listen.
- I can't.

736
00:45:17,582 --> 00:45:19,084
I can't.
Listen.

737
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:20,485
Listen.

738
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:23,789
Just make sure she doesn't
get out of those robes, OK?

739
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:24,622
What's going on?

740
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:25,690
Are you in some kind of trouble?

741
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,125
EDMOND: No, I'm not.

742
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,526
Everything is fine.

743
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:29,961
This is crazy.

744
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,096
I mean, you got a girl tied up.

745
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:31,930
What's going on?

746
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,698
Dad, look, what's the big deal?

747
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:35,566
You used to tie mom to
the bed all the time.

748
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:36,601
Well, how did you know?

749
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:38,136
Do you know about that?

750
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,504
EDMOND: Dad, look,
you don't have to have

751
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:40,906
A conversation with her.

752
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:42,140
Just entertain her.

753
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,374
All right?

754
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,376
Do one of those old
vaudeville routines for her.

755
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:47,612
Do... do the Durante
impersonation.

756
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:48,546
MARVIN: Want me to to do it?

757
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,148
You'd like me to do it for you?

758
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,282
I'll do it for you, all right?

759
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:53,018
How's that?

760
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:54,619
Like that?
That's great, dead.

761
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:56,521
(DURANTE VOICE) Everybody's
trying to get into the act.

762
00:45:56,621 --> 00:45:57,688
Hello, Edmond.

763
00:45:57,789 --> 00:45:59,124
Who tied that girl in there?

764
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:03,461
- That's great.
- How did you like that?

765
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:04,695
That's phenomenal.

766
00:46:04,796 --> 00:46:05,897
Look, dad, do it for her.

767
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:06,832
OK?
OK.

768
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:07,799
- I got to go.
- Where you going?

769
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:08,934
Come here Edmond.

770
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:10,535
You got me worried.
Please, don't go.

771
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:12,003
Dad, look, there's
nothing to worry about.

772
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,739
Everything's OK.

773
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,876
All right, before you go,
will you give your dad a hug?

774
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:18,676
Yeah.

775
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:19,644
All right.

776
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:21,612
OK.

777
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:22,580
I love you.

778
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,714
I love you too, Pop.

779
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:24,515
Take care, take care.

780
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,316
All right.

781
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:38,129
CONNER: Oh, no, no, wait,
whoa, whoa, I'm sorry.

782
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:39,831
I didn't mean to
call you a bitch.

783
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:40,631
No.

784
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,004
You're not a bitch.

785
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,378
No, what you are is
a fine-looking woman.

786
00:46:57,248 --> 00:47:01,019
You deserve to be treated
better like that, baby.

787
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,420
You deserve respect.

788
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:12,397
You taste good.

789
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,567
Mmm.

790
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,536
You like that?

791
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:20,972
Yeah.

792
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:23,875
Oh, oh.

793
00:47:23,975 --> 00:47:25,843
So hard.

794
00:47:25,944 --> 00:47:28,779
I'm sorry sweetie.

795
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,217
Oh, oh, god.

796
00:47:32,317 --> 00:47:33,718
Oh, too hard.

797

[Crunching]

798
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:35,686
Hey, that hurts.

801
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:40,725
Ah!

802
00:47:40,825 --> 00:47:41,526
What are you doing?

803
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:44,129
You crazy.

804
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:46,097
God.

805
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,500
Oh [screaming] Oh,
god, get away from me.

806
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,469
[Crying]

807
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:55,540
Nobody loves me.

[Screaming]

809
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:00,912
Oh, my god.

810
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:05,216
Oh, oh.

00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:30,008
Hello, sweetie pie.

815

[Muffled talking]

816
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,745
You know, I'm not supposed
to take off your tape.

817
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:36,781
My son, Edmond's afraid
that you'll scream.

818
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:37,983
[Muffled talking]

819
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:40,018
Hey, what's going on, anyway?

820
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:41,319
DEE: [muffled talking]

821
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,989
Oh, I see, you can't talk
because you got the tape on.

822
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:45,890
I understand.

823
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:49,194
Listen, are you hungry?

824
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:50,761
Can I make you something
in the kitchen?

825
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:51,862
Something nice?
Mhm.

826
00:48:51,963 --> 00:48:53,298
How about if I make
you some nice meatballs?

827
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:54,632
Hmm.

828
00:48:54,732 --> 00:48:56,201
I make the good, Italian,
delicious meatballs, all right?

829
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:57,102
- [muffled talking]
- OK.

830
00:48:57,202 --> 00:48:58,336
How does that sound?
Good?

831
00:48:58,436 --> 00:48:59,570
Mhm.

832
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:00,972
Now, you be nice and relax,
and I'll be right back.

833
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:02,507
I am going to make it up.
All right, sweetheart?

834
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,275
- Mhm.
- OK, be a good girl, all right?

835
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:11,216
[Door knock]

836
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:18,990
Hey, Conner.

837
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,458
Edmond.

838
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:22,893
You're bleeding.

839
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:27,498
Yeah, I may have punched myself
in the face shadow boxing.

840
00:49:27,598 --> 00:49:29,267
You're naked.

841
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:33,804
Yeah, ah, well, what are
you fucking doing here, Evan?

842
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,706
Listen, man, I was
wondering if you wanted

843
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,242
To go meet my artist friend?
Right now.

844
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:38,409
Now?
Right now?

845
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:39,377
Now.

846
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:40,578
Fuck yeah.

847
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:41,979
Wait here while I get some
clothes on, all right?

848
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:46,751
[Dog barking]

849
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:54,192
EDMOND (VOICEOVER): Man,
it smells funny in here.

850
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:56,327
And Conner had a little dick.

851
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:59,397
Dude, your house smells funny.

852
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:00,931
CONNER: Yeah.

853
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:04,302
I, uh, I think there's a
dead rat under the sink.

854
00:50:04,402 --> 00:50:07,172
It smells familiar.

855
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:10,675
Hey, so you said you were
banging this artist, right?

856
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:11,609
Yeah, something like that.

857
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:13,311
Yeah, you know,
I saw the picture

858
00:50:13,411 --> 00:50:14,845
In the paper the
other day that said

859
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,915
She's got a show going up at
the art gallery in a few days.

860
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:18,916
Yeah, tomorrow.

861
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:19,984
Tomorrow, huh?

862
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:22,120
Yeah.

863
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,021
You told her about me, right?

864
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:26,324
Actually, man, she asked
me to tell you to stop by.

865
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:27,125
No shit?

866
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:29,527
Yeah.

867
00:50:29,627 --> 00:50:31,629
How did you say you
cut your lip again?

868
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:32,897
I told you.

869
00:50:32,997 --> 00:50:34,165
I cut myself in the
face shadowboxing.

870
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:39,704
Can I... can I
ask you something?

871
00:50:39,804 --> 00:50:40,505
Sure.

872
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:46,844
You believe in vampires?

873
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,783
Why do you ask that?

874
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:56,521
Well, you know, I mean, you
and I are pretty good friends,

875
00:50:56,621 --> 00:50:57,655
You know?

876
00:50:57,755 --> 00:50:58,889
I'd like to think that
I can ask you anything.

877
00:50:58,989 --> 00:50:59,924
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:00,991
You can, Edmond.

879
00:51:01,092 --> 00:51:02,460
All right, so I'm asking.

880
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,429
Do you believe in vampires?

881
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:05,296
What if I said that I do?

882
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:11,169
Then I'm going to tell you that
the artist that I'm taking you

883
00:51:11,269 --> 00:51:12,803
To meet right now is a vampire.

884
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,173
And I need your
help in killing her.

885
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:21,279
OK, what if I say that I don't?

886
00:51:21,379 --> 00:51:22,713
Then I'm going to tell
you the same thing.

887
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,285
She's a vampire?

888
00:51:27,385 --> 00:51:28,719
Dude, you didn't
answer my question.

889
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:29,654
What's your question again?

890
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:33,658
Do you believe
in vampires, man?

891
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:35,926
Yeah.

892
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:36,994
I believe in vampires.

893
00:51:39,997 --> 00:51:41,199
Are you in?

894
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:42,633
Is she really a vampire?

895
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:43,601
Absolutely.

896
00:51:43,701 --> 00:51:46,070
Hey, man, then I'm fucking in.

897
00:51:46,171 --> 00:51:46,871
Far out.

898
00:51:53,411 --> 00:51:55,280
EDMOND: All right, no, I'm
not exactly sure how we're

899
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,483
Going to go about doing this.

900
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:00,151
I can't fucking believe this.

901
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:02,019
We're actually driving
to the artists house

902
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,223
Right now to drive a
stake through her heart.

903
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:11,061
Yeah, I mean, I figured
you just hold her down, OK?

904
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:12,397
And I'm going to take
the fucking stake,

905
00:52:12,497 --> 00:52:14,632
And I'm going to jam into
her heart three times.

906
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:18,536
You want me to hold her
down while you stab her?

907
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:19,470
Yeah.

908
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:22,573
Oh, OK.

909
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:25,843
How long have you known that's
she's been a vampire, Edmond?

910
00:52:25,943 --> 00:52:28,213
Basically, since the
first night I met her.

911
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:29,947
I thought you fucked her
the first time you met her?

912
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:31,349
I did fuck her.

913
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:35,686
Look, all right, listen, it was
after we'd finished having sex,

914
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:36,821
OK?

915
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:37,922
EDMOND (VOICEOVER): We
left the art gallery,

916
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:39,224
And we went back to her
place, and you know,

917
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:40,425
We fucked each other.

918
00:52:40,525 --> 00:52:41,726
It was nice.

919
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:44,295
I mean, well, anyways, we're
lying there in the floor.

920
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:45,530
We're talking.

921
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:47,965
We're laughing, and then
out of the blue she tells me

922
00:52:48,065 --> 00:52:50,201
She's a vampire.

923
00:52:50,301 --> 00:52:51,969
I mean, I'm not going to
believe something like that.

924
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:53,304
I'm not that stupid.

925
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:54,272
So I called her bluff.

926
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:55,072
She gets up.

927
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,441
She walks down the hall.

928
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:59,143
She comes fucking back in with
this crazy smile on her face

929
00:52:59,244 --> 00:53:00,845
With a fucking
knife in her hand.

930
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:01,979
She's staring down at me.

931
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,548
And she plunges it right
into her stomach, man.

932
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:04,882
Blood is spurting everywhere.

933
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:06,116
I'm like, what the fuck, man.

934
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:06,884
I jump up.

935
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:07,918
I'm freaking the fuck out.

936
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,620
I start running back
down the hallway.

937
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,755
I go to grab this phone.

938
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:11,856
I'm thinking I've got
to call an ambulance.

939
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:13,258
All of a sudden, she
comes back there.

940
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:14,124
She's looking at me.

941
00:53:14,225 --> 00:53:16,026
And she says, look, Edmond.

942
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,664
I look down there, and her
stomach is completely unharmed.

943
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:21,666
I look up, man, she's got
these demonic eyes, man.

944
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:23,167
They're like glowing red.

945
00:53:23,268 --> 00:53:24,302
She's got these fucking fangs.

946
00:53:24,402 --> 00:53:25,236
She's smiling at me.

947
00:53:25,336 --> 00:53:26,304
I freak out.

948
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:27,405
I start stumbling
back down the hallway.

949
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:29,240
Then she starts like
walking after me

950
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,342
In this dubious,
predatory fashion.

951
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:33,844
She starts telling me
that she wants me to be

952
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,247
Her lover for an eternity.

953
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:38,749
I mean, she wants to turn
me into a fucking vampire.

954
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:40,951
You'll find it very
rewarding, she said.

955
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,787
Then there was like
no place to go.

956
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:44,154
And then she tries to bite me.

957
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:44,955
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

958
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:45,756
What are you doing?

959
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:46,857
What are you doing?

960
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:49,560
I've waited my whole
afterlife to meet you.

961
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,830
Look, we can't do this.

962
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:53,764
I don't want to be a vampire.

963
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,500
I don't want to
live for eternity.

964
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,502
And I don't want to spend
the rest of my existence

965
00:53:57,602 --> 00:53:58,436
With just one person.

966
00:53:58,536 --> 00:54:00,338
That thought is revolting to me.

967
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:01,606
I'm revolting to you?

968
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:03,774
No, you're not revolting to me.

969
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:06,411
I just don't want to be your
little after life long mate.

970
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:07,912
I don't want to be what you are.

971
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:09,246
You're beautiful.

972
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:10,615
You're talented.
You're a bit eccentric.

973
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:12,016
And that's good.

974
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:14,184
Those are all fine attributes
that I look for a girlfriend.

975
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:17,221
But I'm not the type the
person who likes to come in.

976
00:54:17,322 --> 00:54:18,656
And if you think by
turning me into a

977
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,257
Vampire you're going
to get an eternity

978
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:21,659
Of love poems and roses...

979
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:22,793
I hate roses.

980
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:24,695
And faithful monogamy,
then you're wrong.

981
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:26,997
I don't want that.

982
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,198
I don't care what you want.

983
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:30,835
Whoa, whoa, whoa, please,
please, please, look,

984
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:34,271
I just thought I was
supposed to be your servant.

985
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:35,673
I don't want any part of this.

986
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:37,775
I don't want to be a vampire.

987
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:40,110
I detest the taste of blood.

988
00:54:40,210 --> 00:54:44,181
Fine, I'll allow you
to remain a human being.

989
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,684
But in exchange, you'll
do exactly as I say.

990
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,753
OK, fine.

991
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:53,123
If you try to fuck with
me, I won't hesitate

992
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:54,592
To turn you into a vampire.

993
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,630
And now you want to kill her.

994
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,298
Yeah.

995
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:04,435
And your plan... you
drive to her house,

996
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:05,536
Take a piece of
wood, and jab her

997
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:06,571
In the chest a couple of times.

998
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:07,605
Yeah, that's right.

999
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:08,706
All right, let me
ask you a question.

1000
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:09,974
Didn't you tell me
a couple of minutes

1001
00:55:10,074 --> 00:55:11,676
Ago that Diana once
took a kitchen knife

1002
00:55:11,776 --> 00:55:13,778
And stabs herself
in the gut with it?

1003
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:15,446
Yeah.

1004
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:16,914
So what the fuck
makes you think

1005
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:19,049
That taking a piece of wood
and jabbing her in the chest

1006
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,017
Is going to do anything?

1007
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:26,424
Well, OK, I hadn't
thought of that.

1008
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:28,659
So... so kill that plan, OK?

1009
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:31,962
Sure, that's easy enough.

1010
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,798
If only killing
Diana were that easy.

1011
00:55:37,702 --> 00:55:40,471
Hello, sweetie pie,
here's the meatballs.

1012
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:41,439
Mangia, mangia, Italiana.

1013
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:43,874
Listen, you're going
to enjoy these.

1014
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:44,742
You know what this is?

1015
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,644
This is an Italian recipe.

1016
00:55:46,744 --> 00:55:48,846
Believe it or not, it was
my great-great-grandmother's

1017
00:55:48,946 --> 00:55:50,280
Recipe.

1018
00:55:50,381 --> 00:55:51,081
Bless her soul.

1019
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:51,949
She was great.

1020
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:52,817
Smell them.

1021
00:55:52,917 --> 00:55:54,685
Ah, look, smell.

1022
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,353
Oh.

1023
00:55:56,454 --> 00:55:58,155
Oh.

1024
00:55:58,255 --> 00:55:59,089
DEE: Mmm.

1025
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,825
I forgot about the tape.

1026
00:56:00,925 --> 00:56:01,759
I'm sorry.

1027
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:05,062
I forgot about the tape.

1028
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:08,132
Do... do you want me
to remove the tape?

1029
00:56:08,232 --> 00:56:11,235
Oh, I wish show I knew
what was going on.

1030
00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:13,237
Oh, I'll tell you
what's going on.

1031
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:14,939
Your son's a fucking fruit loop.

1032
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,006
Wait a minute.
Hold on.

1033
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:16,974
Take it easy.

1034
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:18,509
Listen, I came
over here because I

1035
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:21,178
Thought we were going
to... and instead,

1036
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:23,047
He ends up tying me to the bed.

1037
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:24,882
You've got to let me go
before he comes back.

1038
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:25,816
I can't do that.

1039
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:27,051
Why not?

1040
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:28,986
My son told me to make sure
that you didn't get out.

1041
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:30,888
But your son's out
of his fucking mind.

1042
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:31,856
Oh, no, no.

1043
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:32,823
My Edmond's a good boy.

1044
00:56:32,923 --> 00:56:34,925
Oh, come on, you
senile motherfucker.

1045
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:36,226
Let me out of here.

1046
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,962
Now, listen, you don't have
to be talking like that.

1047
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:41,131
Suck a dick you wrinkled,
raisin-looking motherfucker.

1048
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,066
Let me out of here.

1049
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:43,534
You should have
more respect here.

1050
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:45,970
Jesus Christ, fucking you!

1051
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,404
All right.

1052
00:56:47,505 --> 00:56:48,506
Oh, you be quiet, girl.

1053
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:50,475
I'm going to be nice.

1054
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:52,443
I'm going to sing a
nice song for you.

1055
00:56:56,481 --> 00:56:57,848
Be quiet.

1056
00:56:57,948 --> 00:57:01,786
Easy, easy, easy.

1057
00:57:01,886 --> 00:57:04,722
Listen, just try to calm down.

1058
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:08,192
My son Edmond will be here
in a few minutes, all right?

1059
00:57:08,292 --> 00:57:11,428
And he'll straighten
this whole thing out.

1060
00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:15,533
Now, in the meantime, I'm going
to sing you a beautiful song,

1061
00:57:15,633 --> 00:57:17,001
A Canadian song that I wrote.

1062
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,936
Would you like to
hear it, sweetie pie?

1063
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:21,438
OK?

1064
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:24,475
(SINGING) In old Montreal,
they are having a ball.

1065
00:57:24,575 --> 00:57:27,845
It's the greatest place in town.

1066
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:31,448
If you like to eat
where the people meet,

1067
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:34,251
It's on St. Dennis Street.

1068
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:39,524
You could see the bell door
hid above that Notre Dame

1069
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:41,926
As far as Pont
Champlain, and all

1070
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:48,666
The French all say parlais vous
francais all over Chinatown.

1071
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:54,639
There are skyways and byways
that tunnel through the town.

1072
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:56,140
And the [inaudible].

1073
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:06,584
[Music playing]

1074
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:39,950
[Music playing]

1075
00:58:43,554 --> 00:58:44,454
[Crash]

1076
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:46,924
Oh, oh.

1077
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:49,426
Ah!

1078
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,928
Ah!

1079
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,396

[Crash]

1082
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,872
What's all this about, Edmond?

1083
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:03,874
I'm not going to be
your servant anymore.

1084
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:05,843
I thought you wanted
to be a painter.

1085
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:07,477
I thought you were
going to be my pupil.

1086
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:09,113
It's over, Diana.

1087
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:10,981
I'm going to kill you.

1088
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:13,784
It's the thing I love
about you, Edmond.

1089
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,621
You're so determined sometimes.

1090
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:21,959
But let me ask you, how
do you plan to do that?

1091
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,094
Oh, it's the girl, isn't it?

1092
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:25,062
Yeah.

1093
00:59:25,162 --> 00:59:26,964
You've fallen in
love with that girl.

1094
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,232
Don't be preposterous.

1095
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:29,834
I don't even know her.

1096
00:59:29,934 --> 00:59:32,202
I just want to live
a normal life again.

1097
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:33,904
The first time I met you,
I fell in love with you.

1098
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:35,072
What's so preposterous about it?

1099
00:59:39,777 --> 00:59:41,646
What's this?

1100
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:45,582
Hmm, oooh, that's not
going to do any good.

1101
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:49,519
And what else [click]
do we have here?

1102
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,959
Hmm, a stake, oh, yummy.

1103
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:03,433
And this must be Conner.

1104
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,435
I've heard a lot about you.

1105
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:09,740
I see Edmond here has recruited
you to assist in destroying me.

1106
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,475
I just wanted to meet you.

1107
01:00:11,575 --> 01:00:13,377
And I you.

1108
01:00:13,477 --> 01:00:17,181
When I saw you did to
that girl's precious neck,

1109
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:18,048
I knew you were different.

1110
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:19,850
Don't listen to her, man.

1111
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,819
She said the same thing to me.

1112
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:23,320
Put the stake down, Conner.

1113
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,789
I know you don't
want to hurt me.

1114
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:25,956
Die, whore, die.

1115
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:26,757
[Stab]

1116
01:00:26,857 --> 01:00:29,727
[Screaming]

1117
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,567
Boo.
Oh!

1118
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:38,568
Jimminy crickets.

1119
01:00:42,606 --> 01:00:46,010
Wood, fire,
crosses, holy water...

1120
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:48,445
You can't learn about the
weaknesses of a vampire

1121
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:50,447
From books and movies.

1122
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:53,450
It doesn't work that
way in the real world.

1123
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:57,421
In the real world, only a
vampire can kill a vampire.

1124
01:00:57,521 --> 01:00:58,756
What?

1125
01:00:58,856 --> 01:01:00,157
Nice try though.

1126
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:04,394
Valiant effort to stop
my reign of terror.

1127
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:08,833
But really, Edmond, is
what I'm doing so wrong?

1128
01:01:08,933 --> 01:01:12,502
I'm revolutionizing the
art world, painting nudes

1129
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:15,539
With the life blood
that allows these bodies

1130
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:17,875
To live and breathe.

1131
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:21,678
That is a totally original
artistic concept and one

1132
01:01:21,779 --> 01:01:24,949
That I truly believe is worth
the lives of a mere dozen

1133
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:27,051
Expendable creatures.

1134
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:29,419
You're an abomination.

1135
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,621
No, Edmond, you're
the abomination, you

1136
01:01:31,722 --> 01:01:33,791
And the billions of
shitless human feeblings

1137
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:36,026
That occupy this planet.

1138
01:01:36,126 --> 01:01:37,962
Your kind will
never replace us.

1139
01:01:38,062 --> 01:01:38,963
I never wanted that.

1140
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:43,834
All I wanted was a companion.

1141
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:48,238

DAD: Hiya, sweetie pie.

1144
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:03,287
I'm going to give
you my imitation

1145
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:05,489
Of Jimmy "Schnozzle" Durante.

1146
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:08,525
Oh, boy, you're
going to like it.

1147
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:11,862
(DURANTE VOICE) Everybody is
trying to get into the act.

1148
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:13,764
What happened to you, baby?

1149
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:16,033
You know I'm mortified.

1150
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:17,701
I don't understand this.

1151
01:02:17,802 --> 01:02:20,938
Oh, baby, it's preposterous.

1152
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:22,372
Who tied you to that bed?

1153
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:32,116
CONNER: You know
what I always thought

1154
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:35,252
Would have made a cool vampire?

1155
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:36,053
Carly Simon.

1156
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:44,829
She had the mouth
for it, you know?

1157
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:45,796
Conner.

1158
01:02:45,896 --> 01:02:46,596
Yeah?

1159
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:51,768
Where's Diana?

1160
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:52,870
She's gone, man.

1161
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:58,575
You look different, man.

1162
01:02:58,675 --> 01:03:00,510
CONNER: I feel
different, Edmond.

1163
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:13,223
She turned you into
a vampire, didn't she?

1164
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:18,395
Edmond, what makes you think
that I want to be a vampire?

1165
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:19,930
Because you're one
fucked up individual, man.

1166
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,666
Oh, see, now that's not nice.

1167
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:24,234
I thought we were
supposed to be friends.

1168
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,370
We are.

1169
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:29,806
So what happened to your neck?

1170
01:03:29,907 --> 01:03:31,241
CONNER: OK, so you
figured it out.

1171
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:33,077
She bit me.

1172
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:34,444
And how you feel about that?

1173
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:36,813
Well, I mean, considering
that I asked her to do it,

1174
01:03:36,914 --> 01:03:38,983
Pretty good.

1175
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:41,185
Why do you want to
be a vampire, man?

1176
01:03:41,285 --> 01:03:43,220
CONNER: Why do you want
to be an artist, Edmond?

1177
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,056
Why does my nephew, Charlie,
want to be a fireman?

1178
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:49,193
I've just always
wanted to be a vampire.

1179
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:50,594
You want to live forever?

1180
01:03:50,694 --> 01:03:52,262
You want to feed off the
blood of innocent people?

1181
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:55,299
CONNER: See, now, actually, I've
always had a strong attraction

1182
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:59,336
To the taste of blood, but shit,
man, every time I bite a woman,

1183
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:00,537
She thinks I'm a freak.

1184
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:05,109
But now I'm a vampire,
my actions are justified.

1185
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:06,911
Shit, man, I don't
know what to say.

1186
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:08,412
Then shut up, Edmond
because you're starting

1187
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:11,581
To act like a big pussy.

1188
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,283
Where's Diana now?

1189
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:15,685
You know, to be a
vampire, she's really no

1190
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,254
Different than any other chick.

1191
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,923
I mean, as soon as she
knocked your ass out,

1192
01:04:19,023 --> 01:04:20,991
She started screaming
shit like I'm

1193
01:04:21,091 --> 01:04:22,960
Going to kill that little bitch
and then he'll see that I'm

1194
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,461
The only true love for him.

1195
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:25,629
What the hell is
she talking about?

1196
01:04:25,729 --> 01:04:26,430
She's jealous, man.

1197
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:27,564
She's upset.

1198
01:04:27,664 --> 01:04:29,633
Oh, well, you know, then
she bit me on the neck,

1199
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,068
And she told me
to be a vampire as

1200
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:32,937
Soon as I make my first kill.

1201
01:04:33,037 --> 01:04:35,205
And then she stormed out of
the house like a madwoman.

1202
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:36,706
Your first kill.

1203
01:04:36,806 --> 01:04:39,009
Yeah.

1204
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:40,810
Obviously, I can't
make the transformation

1205
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:44,982
From human to vampire
until I've killed someone.

1206
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:47,284
So you're not a vampire yet.

1207
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:48,085
Not exactly.

1208
01:04:50,955 --> 01:04:55,092
So what's with the
fucking fangs, man?

1209
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:57,361
They're fake.

1210
01:04:57,461 --> 01:05:00,497
I just couldn't
[inaudible] of my own.

1211
01:05:00,597 --> 01:05:02,032
Dude, so all you got
to do is kill somebody,

1212
01:05:02,132 --> 01:05:03,133
And then you're a vampire?

1213
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,468
That's right.

1214
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:07,137
And guess who it is
that I'm going to kill?

1215
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:09,506
Oh, shit.

1216
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:12,442
Let me take a wild guess, me.

1217
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:13,243
Well, obviously.

1218
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,149
Well, fine, man.

1219
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,286
Let's get this shit over with.

1220
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:24,254

to be a vampire?

be a half vampire?

Oh, shit, man.

Ah, you motherfucker!

You fucking knew I
was going to do it.

1264
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,402
Ah, that's what you did.

1265
01:07:52,502 --> 01:07:53,203

The problem is you were
bitten by a vampire.

Diana broke in, she
bit you on the neck,

love, the girl tied to the bed.

worked in a slaughterhouse.

No, dad, I worked for a

slaughtered hogs.

going to do about it?

I can save Dee.

up about the hookers.

the neck, she's an evil woman.

evil woman alive today.

MARVIN: OK, I
understand that, Edmond.

1373

to kill her, but I can't.

MARVIN: Why not?

1375
01:12:17,801 --> 01:12:19,769
EDMOND: Because only a vampire
can kill another vampire.

1376
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:20,870
MARVIN: Well,
then, in that case,

1377

of any other vampires.

going to kill her?

EDMOND: Yes, All right,
she bit you on the neck.

1382
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:31,415
That means you are
a half vampire.

is kill somebody,

are you trying to say?

here to the alleyway, OK?

1389

and jab it in its neck

start splurting out.

1392
01:12:45,629 --> 01:12:47,030
You position your mouth
underneath the blood,

1393
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:49,198
You take a few sips, and
voila, you're a vampire.

1394
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:50,800
Then we proceed with the plan.

they get laid a lot.

pussy, uh, by playing Dracula

Than you can shake a stick at.

1403
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:12,321
I heard he was a ladies man.

1404
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:14,290
He's like the Wilt
Chamberlain of horror movies.

1405
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,059
I never knew that then.

1406
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:18,261
Yeah, he got sucked off
by more girls offscreen

1407
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:19,529
Than he sucked onscreen.

1408
01:13:19,629 --> 01:13:20,497
Wow!

1409
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:22,098

we going to kill?

1410
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:22,899
Come on.

human being right there.

Gosh.

1413
01:13:31,541 --> 01:13:33,309
You couldn't get anyone
more clean then that?

1414
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,444
That guy is filthy.

1415
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:35,912
Dad, you're not going
to sleep with the guy.

1416
01:13:36,012 --> 01:13:37,146
You're just going
to drink his blood.

1417
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,414
Yeah, but you're at
least going to look

1418
01:13:38,515 --> 01:13:39,783
Around and pick up someone
more attractive than that.

1419
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:40,584
What does it matter?

1420
01:13:40,684 --> 01:13:41,718
Oh.

1421
01:13:41,818 --> 01:13:42,919
You don't love Indian
food because of the way

1422
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:43,953
It looks, do you?

1423
01:13:44,053 --> 01:13:44,754
Yeah.

1424
01:13:44,854 --> 01:13:46,723
All right, look.

1425
01:13:46,823 --> 01:13:49,125
I want you to go into
the alleyway, OK?

1426
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:50,994
Take this knife.

1427
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:52,496
I'm going to bring
him around the corner.

1428
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:54,664
When I come around the
corner, you stab him.

1429
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:55,499
OK.

1430
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:56,800
All right, then.
All right?

1431
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:57,601
OK.

1432
01:13:57,701 --> 01:14:00,036
OK.

up and drink it.

01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,913
It's over, Diana.

1613
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:20,049
You give us the girl,
and we'll let you live.

1614
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:21,784
You have no choice
but to let me live.

1615
01:20:21,885 --> 01:20:24,587
Only a vampire can
kill a vampire.

1616
01:20:24,687 --> 01:20:26,990
Exactly.

1617
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:28,291
Pop, show your teeth.

1618
01:20:28,391 --> 01:20:32,495
DAD: [growling] I
got him in, yeah.

1619
01:20:32,595 --> 01:20:33,863
I got him.

[Growling]

1621
01:20:36,032 --> 01:20:38,501
Me and my old man
are here to stop you.

1622
01:20:38,601 --> 01:20:40,803
I wondered how far you'd go.

1623
01:20:40,904 --> 01:20:44,773
You'd sacrifice your own
father to see me dead?

1624
01:20:44,874 --> 01:20:48,244
I don't know if that's
valiant or vulgar.

1625
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:51,780
My pop's a vampire,
sure, that's a problem.

1626
01:20:51,881 --> 01:20:52,982
But we'll settle
it like we settle

1627
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:55,784
All of our family problems, OK?

1628
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:59,155
Thanks, son, thank
you very much.

1629
01:20:59,255 --> 01:21:01,257
Why are you doing this, Edmond?

1630
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:04,660
Why have you suddenly decided
that you want to kill me?

1631
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,730
Well, there's a lot
of horrible things

1632
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:08,965
That I'll never
forgive myself for.

1633
01:21:09,065 --> 01:21:10,566
But I'm going to try.

1634
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:14,270
And I figured killing you
would be a good place to start.

1635
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:18,007
Then kill me, if you can.

1636
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:19,008
[Loud sound]

1637
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:20,977
Where is she?

1638
01:21:21,077 --> 01:21:22,478
Pop, she's back here.

Hey, get in the car.

1642
01:21:31,087 --> 01:21:31,955
No, you drive.

1643
01:21:32,055 --> 01:21:33,122
I haven't driven
a... get in the car.

1644

Dad, fuck it.
Just drive.

1645
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:35,658
Get in the back seat.
Come on.

1646
01:21:35,758 --> 01:21:36,659
Let's get out of here.
Come on.

1647
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:42,598
All right, go pop, go.

1648
01:21:42,698 --> 01:21:45,101
We can get her.

01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:54,510
All right, dad, pull up
right beside the car.

1651
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:56,512
I'm going to jump out.

1652

1653
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,481
We're almost there.

1654
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:03,119
Pull up.

1655
01:22:03,219 --> 01:22:04,453
Pull up beside their car.
Get a little closer.

1656
01:22:04,553 --> 01:22:05,288
We're almost there.

1657
01:22:05,388 --> 01:22:05,921
We're almost there.
I am.

I'm fine.

ain't craving for a hamburger

I'm talking about.

somewhere that can help you.

Maybe, maybe.

Come sit by me.

into a vampire, huh?

too down about it.

now that you said that.

paint your picture.

ever wanted to be.

want to paint a good picture,

from the heart.
