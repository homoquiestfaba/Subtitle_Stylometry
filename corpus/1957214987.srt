over five times...

And the fact that it seems
to have survived

196
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:32,576
not only exposure to space,
but the intense heat

00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,860
what they're dealing with.

540
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:38,860
Wait, wait, wait.

541
00:31:38,862 --> 00:31:39,861
[helicopter rotors]

542
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:41,830
You were saying?

543
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:44,099
You hear that?

544
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:47,334
Baker to Able.
Do you copy?

545
00:31:47,336 --> 00:31:49,304
<i>They're not responding.
Is it them?</i>

546
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:51,407
Well, I doubt that anyone would
be picnicking out here.

547
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,645
Baker to Able.
Do you copy?

548
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:58,348
Linda, it's Eva!

549
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:03,185
Ah, finally!

550
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,519
They're coming in.

551
00:32:04,521 --> 00:32:07,255
See? We're good!
We're safe!

552
00:32:07,257 --> 00:32:09,123
Eyes are peeled.

553
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:12,092
<i>For what? Ain't nothing out
here but lizards and beach.</i>

554
00:32:12,094 --> 00:32:13,461
You know, maybe
you're right.

555
00:32:13,463 --> 00:32:15,263
I'm thinking about
this all wrong.

556
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:16,398
It's my fault.

557
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,633
Power of psychological thinking.

558
00:32:19,635 --> 00:32:20,805
[rumbling]

559
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:24,605
Is that an earthquake?

560
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:25,573
No.

561
00:32:25,575 --> 00:32:27,745
- Run!
- Linda! Linda!

562
00:32:32,215 --> 00:32:35,217
[roaring]

563
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,052
How's that for a target?

564
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:38,786
<i>Jesus.</i>

565
00:32:38,788 --> 00:32:40,655
Myers, get down!

566
00:32:40,657 --> 00:32:42,160
[roaring]

567
00:32:43,893 --> 00:32:45,328
I'm opening fire!

568
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,470
C'mere.

569
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,180
Who do you think's flying
that helicopter?

570
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:04,746
Someone with a lot of balls.

571
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:07,716
I'm coming around
for another pass!

572
00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:09,717
It's time for the chain gun.

573
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:10,821
[beeping]

574
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:17,158
<i>That ain't doing squat!
That armor's too thick!</i>

575
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,763
Ah!

576
00:33:24,468 --> 00:33:25,803
It's coming.

577
00:33:27,738 --> 00:33:32,373
Time to show this lizard
you don't mess with a Russian.

578
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:34,409
I'm firing more rockets!

579
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:35,979
[explosions]

580
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,781
<i>That thing's too close,
you might hit the team!</i>

581
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:42,820
They're dead if I don't fire!
I'm firing now!

582
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,600
<i>Knock, knock.
The reptile's gone.</i>

583
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:00,771
He's underground.

584
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,906
Anyone home?

585
00:34:04,908 --> 00:34:06,073
It's Eva.

586
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:07,942
A few minutes more
and I was gonna leave.

587
00:34:07,944 --> 00:34:10,511
Was that you flying?

588
00:34:10,513 --> 00:34:13,781
That was some
fancy flying back there.

589
00:34:13,783 --> 00:34:15,449
We lost Myers.

590
00:34:15,451 --> 00:34:17,351
I know. I saw.

591
00:34:17,353 --> 00:34:18,853
That creature...

592
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:22,223
Gila Monster,
no doubt about it.

593
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:24,058
The image on the video was...

594
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:29,163
Its tail, yes,
I can see that now, but how?

595
00:34:29,165 --> 00:34:31,366
The desert is its home.

596
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:35,603
Only an alien element could have
caused such a massive mutation.

597
00:34:35,605 --> 00:34:38,207
We found remnants
of it at the site, clearly.

598
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,875
Right.

599
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,542
The creature made contact.
It's been growing ever since.

600
00:34:41,544 --> 00:34:43,478
Right. You ready to go
back to work

601
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,549
or is that your
new lab down there?

602
00:34:56,426 --> 00:34:58,592
- [Abraham roaring]
- [alarm blaring]

603
00:34:58,594 --> 00:35:00,228
He's gotten loose!

604
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,196
Brace the door!

605
00:35:02,198 --> 00:35:03,897
He's trying to get out!

606
00:35:03,899 --> 00:35:05,035
[roaring]

607
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:11,172
[growling]

608
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:12,239
Ah!

609
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:14,312
Close the door!
Close the door!

610
00:35:18,314 --> 00:35:19,616
No!

611
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,392
[roars]

612
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:35,062
I've already notified
Washington and the Kremlin.

613
00:35:35,064 --> 00:35:37,397
This lizard won't
remain hidden for long.

614
00:35:37,399 --> 00:35:38,732
But how to destroy it?

615
00:35:38,734 --> 00:35:41,101
The strikes you made
only seemed to slow him.

616
00:35:41,103 --> 00:35:42,304
Yes.

617
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,371
Obviously, much
higher concentration

618
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:44,940
of firepower will be necessary.

619
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,141
<i>This is Langley
for Dr. Murphy.</i>

620
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:47,841
It's the lab.

621
00:35:47,843 --> 00:35:51,078
<i>Linda, he's got loose.
We couldn't stop him.</i>

622
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,116
Abraham's escaped.

623
00:35:54,384 --> 00:35:55,717
Abraham's escaped!

624
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,018
What?

625
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,252
There's no way.

626
00:35:58,254 --> 00:36:00,357
[speaks Russian]

627
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:12,234
I don't understand.

628
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:15,236
His growth rate had slowed.

629
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:18,475
How could he grow three times
his size so quickly?

630
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:28,119
I want to see
the surveillance video.

631
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:31,087
Freeze it.

632
00:36:32,955 --> 00:36:36,458
What about the cameras in
the bunker before the breakout?

633
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,460
Maybe it has some clue.

634
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:41,596
Unfortunately, the simian
disabled the surveillance camera

635
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:43,834
shortly before we received
your distress call.

636
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:48,536
He's changed, but how?

637
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:49,774
What caused it?

638
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,774
Abraham's tracker!

639
00:36:52,776 --> 00:36:54,710
Where is he heading now?

640
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,777
Moving fast. Looks like
he's heading north towards...

641
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:58,679
Seaford? I don't know.

642
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:01,216
Any reports
of further destruction?

643
00:37:01,218 --> 00:37:03,752
[sighs] No, unfortunately, he's
in the Blue Ridge Mountains,

644
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:06,654
but it's a ideal hiding
place for an ape.

645
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:08,989
A creature that size
doesn't just disappear.

646
00:37:08,991 --> 00:37:11,528
People will think that
it's your American Bigfoot.

647
00:37:12,529 --> 00:37:14,362
It's just a matter of time.

648
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:15,830
There are rumors
he has destroyed

649
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:18,400
your new Extraterrestrial
Defense Initiative.

650
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,100
But nobody here will confirm it.

651
00:37:20,102 --> 00:37:23,105
How do you know about EDI?
That's classified.

652
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,138
Your new Star Wars program?
Please.

653
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,841
Haven't you learned
this yet about us Russians?

654
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:30,045
We know things about
you people before you do.

655
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:31,145
[alarm ringing]

656
00:37:31,147 --> 00:37:33,549
The signal's gone dead.

657
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,016
What was his last location?

658
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:39,457
I don't know,
looks like Beaverton.

659
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:41,422
Huh.

660
00:37:41,424 --> 00:37:43,958
You know it?

661
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,826
Yeah, I know it.

662
00:37:45,828 --> 00:37:48,598
Went fishing there
when I was growing up.

663
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:52,236
We need to get to Washington.

664
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:55,036
I think I should...

665
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:56,670
Yes, Jones?

666
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:58,609
Jones, get your coat.

667
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:03,247
Fine, fine.
I'm coming, I'm coming.

668
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:05,483
Coming!

669
00:38:39,015 --> 00:38:40,683
[cawing]

670
00:38:48,123 --> 00:38:49,225
[cawing]

671
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:52,663
[shrieking]

672
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:00,033
We just got word!

673
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:02,971
Abraham was spotted three miles
east of Rollins Fork!

674
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,438
We know, but that
was two hours ago.

675
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,540
No eyes yet.

676
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:07,475
Abraham ripped out his GPS.

677
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:08,609
Smart monkey!

678
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:10,312
How can you lose giant ape?

679
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:13,614
He hasn't hit any
major population centers

680
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:14,815
and appears to be hiding.

681
00:39:14,817 --> 00:39:17,051
Nonsense!
It's a monkey!

682
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:19,420
With the ability to comprehend
complex thoughts.

683
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:21,888
What about that lizard?

684
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,424
Underground. No chip.

685
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:25,725
You have big problem in America.

686
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:28,263
Lizards can swim,
First Secretary.

687
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:30,699
Russia can soon have
the same problem.

688
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,533
Abraham must be getting bigger.

689
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:33,737
How?

690
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:37,406
The man behind Project Elbe
is your father, right?

691
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,241
He has nothing to do with this.

692
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:41,408
Well, he may be able to give
us some answers we need.

693
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,944
Like what?

694
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:46,882
Like why Abraham is still
alive after all this time?

695
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,518
Why is he behaving
so strategically?

696
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,819
In case you don't
remember, he was dismissed

697
00:39:52,821 --> 00:39:54,455
from the program
because of Elbe.

698
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:57,324
I suggest you look
at the present for answers,

699
00:39:57,326 --> 00:39:58,893
not the past.

700
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:02,163
I believe your emotions
are, uh...

701
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:05,067
adversely coloring your
conclusions, Dr. Murphy.

702
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,900
There's nothing
personal here, sir.

703
00:40:06,902 --> 00:40:09,069
I haven't spoken to my father
in over 10 years.

704
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:14,442
You reported some kind
of glow for this creature.

705
00:40:14,444 --> 00:40:15,976
Is that correct, Dr. Murphy?

706
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:16,978
Yes.

707
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,011
But your super chimp...

708
00:40:18,013 --> 00:40:19,281
- Abraham.
- Abraham, yeah.

709
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,382
He didn't show any glow.

710
00:40:21,384 --> 00:40:23,518
No, sir, not since last contact.

711
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,254
Well, what do you think
accounts for this discrepancy?

712
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:28,156
We believe Abraham's
ingestion of the substance

713
00:40:28,158 --> 00:40:30,091
was a gradual
microparticulate intake...

714
00:40:30,093 --> 00:40:31,592
- Uh-huh.
- Much like a gas.

715
00:40:31,594 --> 00:40:32,627
Okay.

716
00:40:32,629 --> 00:40:34,129
It slowly penetrated the capsule

717
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:36,364
and mixed with the oxygen
Abraham was breathing.

718
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:38,399
Whereas the Gila
monster may have ingested

719
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:39,634
the substance directly.

720
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:41,768
This is all very
interesting, doctors.

721
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,538
I have only one question.

722
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,308
Where exactly are these
two freaks of nature now?

723
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,409
Let me introduce
General Delaney, doctors,

724
00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:53,413
taking command for
the late General Reynolds.

725
00:40:53,415 --> 00:40:58,252
Dr. Murphy, I understand you and
my predecessor were very close.

726
00:40:58,254 --> 00:41:02,290
You have my sympathies,
but you must appreciate

727
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:06,393
that this is not a time
for emotional outcries.

728
00:41:06,395 --> 00:41:08,864
I didn't believe
I was engaging in any.

729
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:10,899
The safety of this great nation

730
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:14,435
must take precedence
over any scientific debate.

731
00:41:14,437 --> 00:41:16,370
Debate over what?

732
00:41:16,372 --> 00:41:20,607
Both monsters must be
destroyed immediately.

733
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:22,611
Now wait a minute!
Abraham...

734
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,411
Abraham. You see?

735
00:41:24,413 --> 00:41:29,083
You're talking like that ape
is your pet hamster!

736
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:32,453
Look, this is
all academic, girls.

737
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:33,855
Girls?

738
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:37,391
The orders have been given.
Shoot to kill.

739
00:41:37,393 --> 00:41:38,926
Is this true, sir?

740
00:41:38,928 --> 00:41:40,428
Abraham is part of
the space program!

741
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:45,031
For all intents and purposes,
he is a test pilot.

742
00:41:45,033 --> 00:41:47,634
You don't have to kill him!

743
00:41:47,636 --> 00:41:49,937
We can figure out what's wrong,
fix this disease.

744
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:51,272
General Delaney's right.

745
00:41:51,274 --> 00:41:52,940
We can't afford
any more casualties.

746
00:41:52,942 --> 00:41:56,109
And certainly not
a nationwide panic!

747
00:41:56,111 --> 00:41:59,281
Your job now is
to track these beasts.

748
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,549
Locate them and
let the military do the rest!

749
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:04,853
Is that clear?

750
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,090
Clear, sir.

751
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,931
You were saying, General?

752
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,232
I was saying I have
six armored divisions

753
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:21,236
massing on the
West Virginia border.

754
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:26,509
As soon as that salamander
shows his skin, he's guacamole!

755
00:42:28,277 --> 00:42:34,449
I was here, you know,
when I was a child.

756
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,884
I didn't.

757
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:41,388
I remember you
speaking of your father,

758
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,723
the great Noel Murphy.

759
00:42:42,725 --> 00:42:45,027
Hah. Great.

760
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:50,031
He is, after all, the father
of modern astrophysics.

761
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:52,435
He should have been
father to his children.

762
00:42:54,337 --> 00:42:59,008
Genius takes precedence.
at times, even over life.

763
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,475
Star Trek?

764
00:43:01,477 --> 00:43:03,212
Lenin.

765
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:07,515
You clearly admired the man.

766
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:09,553
You keep his photograph.

767
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:12,920
You followed in his footsteps.

768
00:43:12,922 --> 00:43:16,556
I wanted his approval,

769
00:43:16,558 --> 00:43:20,194
but even then, I knew
his methods were unethical.

770
00:43:20,196 --> 00:43:23,263
And that the ends
didn't justify the means.

771
00:43:23,265 --> 00:43:26,435
And all the animals forced
into the space program.

772
00:43:27,136 --> 00:43:30,437
Laika, Miss Baker

773
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:33,808
and all of the rabbits,
dogs, mice...

774
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:36,643
and chimps all forcibly
shot into space

775
00:43:36,645 --> 00:43:39,480
for the benefit of mankind
were a terrible mistake

776
00:43:39,482 --> 00:43:41,216
borne out of ambition

777
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:44,821
and ignorance... and that
it would never happen again.

778
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:49,390
My father lied to me,

779
00:43:49,392 --> 00:43:51,692
the great man,

780
00:43:51,694 --> 00:43:54,895
said that this time
it would be different.

781
00:43:54,897 --> 00:43:57,401
That Abraham would be safe.

782
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:00,366
And how he would return a hero

783
00:44:00,368 --> 00:44:03,504
and become
the most important ape...

784
00:44:03,506 --> 00:44:07,444
important animal...
who ever lived.

785
00:44:08,578 --> 00:44:10,344
But he has returned

786
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:13,446
and your father's prophecy
may very well come to pass.

787
00:44:13,448 --> 00:44:19,788
Abraham was lost
in space for 30 years!

788
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,757
Can you imagine the toll
that has taken on his mind,

789
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:26,995
if he has any mind at all?

790
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,531
To speak nothing
of this mutation which,

791
00:44:30,533 --> 00:44:34,304
in all probability,
will most likely kill him.

792
00:44:36,906 --> 00:44:40,377
My father promised me...

793
00:44:41,844 --> 00:44:45,179
no more animals would suffer

794
00:44:45,181 --> 00:44:47,050
and I believed him!

795
00:44:48,651 --> 00:44:53,656
So much so that I made Abraham
that very same promise!

796
00:44:58,728 --> 00:45:01,098
It wasn't your fault, Milaya.

797
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,835
As children, we were taught

798
00:45:07,837 --> 00:45:12,040
the individual is not important.

799
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,178
But what matters most
is service to the state.

800
00:45:17,747 --> 00:45:21,984
So if one man matters not,
what chance had an animal?

801
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:28,325
I've learned a lot since then.

802
00:45:39,835 --> 00:45:42,835
I'll be damned if all I do is
put a target on Abraham's back.

803
00:45:42,837 --> 00:45:45,940
We must find him first and try
to arrest his growth.

804
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:47,875
Here.

805
00:45:47,877 --> 00:45:49,743
We will, Milaya.

806
00:45:49,745 --> 00:45:51,411
Okay.

807
00:45:51,413 --> 00:45:53,547
I've enhanced
our Apache's thermal tracking

808
00:45:53,549 --> 00:45:56,618
software with an algorithm
that can recognize

809
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,087
the alien cells that are active
within Abraham's biology.

810
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:02,259
But once located,
will he come quietly?

811
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:06,460
You're going to need
a bigger teddy bear.

812
00:46:06,462 --> 00:46:08,529
I have the lab working up
a hyper tranquilizer.

813
00:46:08,531 --> 00:46:10,964
The one we currently have
wouldn't put his leg to sleep.

814
00:46:10,966 --> 00:46:12,866
I've got a plan
for a net

815
00:46:12,868 --> 00:46:15,736
that can be jettisoned from
the belly of the Apache.

816
00:46:15,738 --> 00:46:17,337
It requires explosives

817
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:21,875
and acts like an inverse reentry
parachute deployment system.

818
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:24,379
No rest for the weary, huh?
Just like Oxford.

819
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:27,614
I got a friend at JPL
working on the prototype.

820
00:46:27,616 --> 00:46:30,083
But it's not gonna be
ready in over 24 hours.

821
00:46:30,085 --> 00:46:31,719
What are you thinking, Milaya?

822
00:46:31,721 --> 00:46:34,654
We're doing everything we can,
and on no sleep at that.

823
00:46:34,656 --> 00:46:37,759
Are we?

824
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:39,694
We must be missing something.

825
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:40,862
What?

826
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:42,462
I don't know.

827
00:46:42,464 --> 00:46:45,466
I mean, we've been so
focused on the creatures.

828
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:47,433
Maybe we should worry
about this green goo.

829
00:46:47,435 --> 00:46:50,004
Let the military
worry about that.

830
00:46:50,006 --> 00:46:51,141
[phone rings]

831
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,844
Hello?

832
00:46:55,846 --> 00:46:57,712
When?

833
00:46:57,714 --> 00:46:59,612
Check the news.

834
00:46:59,614 --> 00:47:01,248
[woman]
<i>All communications are down</i>

835
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:02,917
<i>for ten miles
surrounding Huntington</i>

836
00:47:02,919 --> 00:47:05,719
<i>due to an unidentified
electrical disturbance.</i>

837
00:47:05,721 --> 00:47:08,455
That's gotta be
that damn lizard.

838
00:47:08,457 --> 00:47:10,257
Delaney will be diverting
all of his efforts

839
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:12,592
towards taking down
that Gila monster.

840
00:47:12,594 --> 00:47:14,728
We might have a chance
to save Abraham.

841
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:16,165
Let's go.

842
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:35,815
I've got something...
faint, but it's there.

843
00:47:35,817 --> 00:47:38,585
Bearing?

844
00:47:38,587 --> 00:47:39,853
Eight-two-zero.

845
00:47:39,855 --> 00:47:41,355
Copy.

846
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:43,324
There's no safe place
to pull over.

847
00:47:43,326 --> 00:47:45,159
Find a clearing!
Anywhere!

848
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:47,295
Copy.

849
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:49,766
Up ahead, right over there.

850
00:48:00,843 --> 00:48:02,845
He's up ahead, 50 meters.

851
00:48:05,781 --> 00:48:08,583
Strange.

852
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,420
Blood.

853
00:48:12,754 --> 00:48:14,087
No.

854
00:48:14,089 --> 00:48:15,591
Unknown.

855
00:48:18,727 --> 00:48:20,194
Hang on.

856
00:48:20,196 --> 00:48:22,062
The cell count is diminishing.

857
00:48:22,064 --> 00:48:24,799
It's the air, yes.

858
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:27,370
It kills the alien cells.

859
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,140
We made some
preliminary findings

860
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,310
while you were patrolling
the crash site.

861
00:48:37,647 --> 00:48:39,547
Findings?

862
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:41,348
And then all hell broke loose.

863
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,982
What findings?

864
00:48:42,984 --> 00:48:45,685
As I said, whatever
extraterrestrial component

865
00:48:45,687 --> 00:48:49,190
is inherent in that material
is not viable in our atmosphere.

866
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,692
It needs a living host.

867
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:51,891
Living host?

868
00:48:51,893 --> 00:48:53,895
What about the samples
back at the base?

869
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:54,995
They're all stable.

870
00:48:54,997 --> 00:48:56,696
For a short time.

871
00:48:56,698 --> 00:48:58,199
And then?

872
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,533
Total necrosis.

873
00:48:59,535 --> 00:49:01,470
The blood's already
breaking down.

874
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:07,377
Abraham is going to die.

875
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:11,444
When were you going
to tell me this?

876
00:49:11,446 --> 00:49:13,413
I wanted to, believe me.

877
00:49:13,415 --> 00:49:16,317
But with the Gila surfacing
and racing to save you...

878
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,752
Oh, bullshit!

879
00:49:18,754 --> 00:49:20,221
What else are you
not telling me?

880
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:21,591
Nothing.

881
00:49:22,892 --> 00:49:24,891
That's not true.

882
00:49:24,893 --> 00:49:26,127
Look me in the eye.

883
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,761
- Ah...
- No!

884
00:49:27,763 --> 00:49:30,864
Look at me, Eva!

885
00:49:30,866 --> 00:49:33,303
What the hell did you do?

886
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,709
Abraham.

887
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,614
You injected him, didn't you?

888
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:50,583
You injected him and then
erased the surveillance videos.

889
00:49:50,585 --> 00:49:53,687
Abraham didn't destroy
the cameras back at the bunker.

890
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:57,357
You did! Why?

891
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,460
We were running out of time!

892
00:49:59,462 --> 00:50:01,962
I did what was necessary
to keep the entity alive!

893
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:03,397
You sacrificed Abraham!

894
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:06,468
Sometimes sacrifices
are necessary, Milaya!

895
00:50:09,872 --> 00:50:11,272
Lenin?

896
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:12,409
Me.

897
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:18,779
For all your education,
all your brilliance,

898
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:20,517
you haven't learned
anything at all.

899
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:29,156
Doctors, I'm Captain James Tsao,
Special Recon.

900
00:50:29,158 --> 00:50:30,326
Is everything all right?

901
00:50:31,893 --> 00:50:33,795
From Langley?

902
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,161
I remember you.

903
00:50:35,163 --> 00:50:36,529
What are you doing here?

904
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:38,333
Same thing you are,
hunting that monkey.

905
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,333
We received a report
you'd set down.

906
00:50:40,335 --> 00:50:42,101
We came to assist.

907
00:50:42,103 --> 00:50:45,373
Thank you, but we don't
need your assistance.

908
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,641
As you can see,
what she means, Captain,

909
00:50:47,643 --> 00:50:49,643
is that the area is clear.

910
00:50:49,645 --> 00:50:53,181
This is a wild duck chase,
as you Americans say.

911
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:56,150
Goose, wild goose.

912
00:50:56,152 --> 00:50:58,986
Sir?

913
00:50:58,988 --> 00:50:59,987
Over here!

914
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:04,158
Looks like blood, sir.

915
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,725
I wouldn't.

916
00:51:05,727 --> 00:51:07,362
There's a Gila monster
the size of a space shuttle

917
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,864
burrowing through West Virginia
because it touched that stuff.

918
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,864
Back off, Harker!

919
00:51:11,866 --> 00:51:15,703
As you can see, Captain,
there's nothing here.

920
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:18,406
If he was here,
he's long gone now.

921
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,507
We appreciate your
medical advice, doctors.

922
00:51:20,509 --> 00:51:23,377
But as for the target,
we'll see for ourselves.

923
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:24,377
If you'll excuse us.

924
00:51:24,379 --> 00:51:25,748
Move out!

925
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,585
You're off my team.

926
00:51:56,377 --> 00:52:00,015
It's here.
I can feel it.

927
00:52:01,716 --> 00:52:04,551
How does an ape get to be
the size of a blimp, Cap?

928
00:52:04,553 --> 00:52:06,252
That's not
your concern, soldier.

929
00:52:06,254 --> 00:52:07,721
Yeah, you're right.

930
00:52:07,723 --> 00:52:10,927
It doesn't matter how
as long as it burns.

931
00:52:14,763 --> 00:52:15,731
Abraham?

932
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,366
Target located.

933
00:52:19,368 --> 00:52:20,768
Sir?
What if it's the girls?

934
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:22,972
Collateral damage.
[chuckles]

935
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:27,975
[grenade explodes]

936
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:30,676
- Got him! Cover our flank!
- Come on!

937
00:52:30,678 --> 00:52:33,013
Let's get it together.
We got a date with...

938
00:52:33,015 --> 00:52:36,585
[roaring]

939
00:52:39,522 --> 00:52:41,357
[roaring]

940
00:52:44,326 --> 00:52:46,062
Abraham!

941
00:52:50,232 --> 00:52:52,568
[shrieking]

942
00:53:13,288 --> 00:53:15,121
<i>This is a critical situation.</i>

943
00:53:15,123 --> 00:53:18,991
<i>Do you understand what will
happen if we don't stop this?</i>

944
00:53:18,993 --> 00:53:20,861
And why didn't
you tranquilize him?

945
00:53:20,863 --> 00:53:23,730
Dr. Kuleshov
had the tranquilizer,

946
00:53:23,732 --> 00:53:25,399
as I already explained.

947
00:53:25,401 --> 00:53:26,866
We split up.

948
00:53:26,868 --> 00:53:28,734
I presume she broke away
to pursue the Gila monster.

949
00:53:28,736 --> 00:53:30,638
But I haven't been
able to reach her.

950
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,875
This is why girls
should not be in combat!

951
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,875
Call me girl one more time!

952
00:53:35,877 --> 00:53:38,612
People, this is the Pentagon!

953
00:53:38,614 --> 00:53:41,848
If you want to fight,
go to Capitol Hill.

954
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:45,085
Now where is Dr. Kuleshov?

955
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,388
Like I said,
I lost contact with her.

956
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,156
After the Special Forces
team was routed.

957
00:53:49,158 --> 00:53:50,826
You mean slaughtered!

958
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,294
Let's not lose
the thread here.

959
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:54,694
Kuleshov is officially missing

960
00:53:54,696 --> 00:53:56,929
and our Apache helicopter's
not been found.

961
00:53:56,931 --> 00:53:59,966
Do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

962
00:53:59,968 --> 00:54:01,335
No, sir.

963
00:54:01,337 --> 00:54:02,603
Either she's... KIA...

964
00:54:02,605 --> 00:54:04,605
Or she doesn't want
to be found.

965
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:07,841
<i>Dr. Kuleshov is not
important right now.</i>

966
00:54:07,843 --> 00:54:11,444
<i>If she is dead,
then she died for the cause.</i>

967
00:54:11,446 --> 00:54:13,446
<i>We should focus
on task at hand.</i>

968
00:54:13,448 --> 00:54:14,948
<i>Where is this chimp?</i>

969
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:17,116
I conducted a thorough sweep
of the immediate area

970
00:54:17,118 --> 00:54:18,252
after I was picked up.

971
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:19,453
No sign.

972
00:54:19,455 --> 00:54:21,321
And the giant lizard?

973
00:54:21,323 --> 00:54:24,126
Went underground after
it entered West Virginia.

974
00:54:30,732 --> 00:54:34,368
Sure does seem like the lizard
is going after the ape.

975
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,002
Looking for a fight!

976
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:37,703
<i>Maybe that's for the best.</i>

977
00:54:37,705 --> 00:54:40,975
<i>After all, they can do
what you could not:</i>

978
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:42,275
<i>kill each other.</i>

979
00:54:42,277 --> 00:54:44,444
Maybe on your soil, Comrade.

980
00:54:44,446 --> 00:54:47,315
Those two beasts
start going at it,

981
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,982
we're going to pay the price.

982
00:54:48,984 --> 00:54:51,786
I don't believe they're being
led towards each other.

983
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,219
They're not natural enemies.

984
00:54:53,221 --> 00:54:55,589
And you know this because
you've worked

985
00:54:55,591 --> 00:54:59,027
with giant, unearthly
beasts before?

986
00:55:00,663 --> 00:55:02,196
Marcos, assemble your team.

987
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:05,199
Let's try and box these
MFA fighters

988
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:08,469
into some remote area
in Shenandoah Park.

989
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,105
Minimize the damage that way.

990
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:13,708
Do what we must to neutralize
the Gila monster,

991
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,308
but prioritize
Abraham's capture.

992
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:16,743
Here we go.

993
00:55:16,745 --> 00:55:20,647
It is his capture
that is essential...

994
00:55:20,649 --> 00:55:23,986
or the horror we're facing now
will only just be the beginning.

995
00:55:43,004 --> 00:55:44,437
[beeping]

996
00:55:44,439 --> 00:55:45,437
My God.

997
00:55:45,439 --> 00:55:48,275
Jones, get over here!

998
00:55:48,277 --> 00:55:49,710
What do you want?

999
00:55:49,712 --> 00:55:51,911
We've always known that
the Gila monster emits

1000
00:55:51,913 --> 00:55:53,346
an intense cosmic glow

1001
00:55:53,348 --> 00:55:55,915
stemming from its exposure
to the alien substance.

1002
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:59,018
Not... Although naked
to the visible eye,

1003
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,455
the same emittance is
detectable within Abraham,

1004
00:56:01,457 --> 00:56:03,623
albeit at much lower levels.

1005
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:05,558
And that this emittance
is internal,

1006
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:10,397
emerging from the bodies of the
animals in question, correct?

1007
00:56:10,399 --> 00:56:12,699
- Correct.
- Incorrect.

1008
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:14,600
Check this.

1009
00:56:14,602 --> 00:56:17,404
Every occurrence from
the Gila monster's attack

1010
00:56:17,406 --> 00:56:22,408
on the train to my last
encounter with Abraham.

1011
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:24,143
I don't understand.
What am I looking at?

1012
00:56:24,145 --> 00:56:26,145
I upgraded our
sky mapping system

1013
00:56:26,147 --> 00:56:29,348
based on the cellular pattern
of the alien substance.

1014
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,850
That seems like an excessive
amount of work.

1015
00:56:31,852 --> 00:56:33,721
I suspected something.

1016
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,823
Look, right here.

1017
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:38,558
These are distinct beams
of extraterrestrial energy,

1018
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,194
definitely incoming.

1019
00:56:41,196 --> 00:56:45,199
They were there all along.
We just couldn't see them.

1020
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:48,034
Wait, but these are going
from New Mexico to Virginia.

1021
00:56:48,036 --> 00:56:50,304
Yeah, confirming our theory

1022
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:54,607
that the quakes there
were Gila-monster-related.

1023
00:56:54,609 --> 00:56:58,379
So you're saying that the...

1024
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:00,946
the glow contains
the same elemental properties

1025
00:57:00,948 --> 00:57:03,583
as the Gila monster...

1026
00:57:03,585 --> 00:57:07,721
- ...and the green substance.
- And our readings off Abraham?

1027
00:57:07,723 --> 00:57:08,955
Yes.

1028
00:57:08,957 --> 00:57:11,857
But what are they?

1029
00:57:11,859 --> 00:57:14,997
I believe
it's a guidance system.

1030
00:57:17,565 --> 00:57:19,065
A what?

1031
00:57:19,067 --> 00:57:21,768
Abraham and the Gila monster

1032
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:24,006
are being directed
via remote control.

1033
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:29,310
You've lost your mind.
It's happened. It's official.

1034
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:32,348
It's all right there.
I'm 100% certain.

1035
00:57:35,017 --> 00:57:36,216
Yeah, you've lost your mind.

1036
00:57:36,218 --> 00:57:37,417
Look!

1037
00:57:37,419 --> 00:57:38,919
The green substance is
in their blood stream.

1038
00:57:38,921 --> 00:57:40,219
And if the aliens can
control that,

1039
00:57:40,221 --> 00:57:41,922
they can control
their every move.

1040
00:57:41,924 --> 00:57:43,726
It's incredible.

1041
00:57:50,966 --> 00:57:52,766
Okay. Where and by what?

1042
00:57:52,768 --> 00:57:54,567
I ordered Hubble
to provide visuals

1043
00:57:54,569 --> 00:57:55,935
detailing point of origin.

1044
00:57:55,937 --> 00:57:57,404
We should get them shortly.

1045
00:57:57,406 --> 00:58:01,975
But the last beam originated
from this location.

1046
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:03,844
The Andromeda Galaxy.

1047
00:58:03,846 --> 00:58:06,379
2.5 million light years away,

1048
00:58:06,381 --> 00:58:08,181
and the Milky Way's
closest neighbor.

1049
00:58:08,183 --> 00:58:09,417
[phone rings]

1050
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:10,551
Hello?

1051
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:12,486
Copy.

1052
00:58:12,488 --> 00:58:13,888
Thank you.

1053
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,255
From Hubble.

1054
00:58:15,257 --> 00:58:16,056
Images coming in.

1055
00:58:16,058 --> 00:58:17,460
Put it up on the big screen.

1056
00:58:20,629 --> 00:58:21,998
Good God!

1057
00:58:24,065 --> 00:58:26,333
How do we defend against this?

1058
00:58:26,335 --> 00:58:28,067
EDI.

1059
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:31,038
The Extraterrestrial
Defense Initiative

1060
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,408
was created for just such
a purpose, First Secretary.

1061
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:37,143
However, the EDI Operations
Center was destroyed

1062
00:58:37,145 --> 00:58:38,779
when Abraham escaped
from Langley.

1063
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,880
My understanding
it was under repair.

1064
00:58:40,882 --> 00:58:44,451
Not until further
appropriations are approved.

1065
00:58:44,453 --> 00:58:47,054
Calm down, General.

1066
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,621
- More politics?
- <i>This is unacceptable.</i>

1067
00:58:49,623 --> 00:58:52,658
<i>I need you to do something,
not just sit there.</i>

1068
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:55,328
So we're looking at
two remote-controlled monsters

1069
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:58,698
guided by an alien mothership
headed for earth?

1070
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,167
No.

1071
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:02,036
The Gila monster is
definitely being controlled,

1072
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:05,205
but Abraham's signal is weak.

1073
00:59:05,207 --> 00:59:08,074
I think he's resisting control.

1074
00:59:08,076 --> 00:59:11,247
Irregardless,
this is war, gentlemen!

1075
00:59:13,381 --> 00:59:14,948
Intergalactic combat!

1076
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:16,750
Careful, General.

1077
00:59:16,752 --> 00:59:20,554
I do believe you're drooling.

1078
00:59:20,556 --> 00:59:22,723
Dad?

1079
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:25,558
What are you doing here?

1080
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,027
As I said earlier, doctor,

1081
00:59:27,029 --> 00:59:30,563
reinforcements are needed,
particularly now.

1082
00:59:30,565 --> 00:59:32,966
Well, hello, my daughter.

1083
00:59:32,968 --> 00:59:35,502
Nothing to say?

1084
00:59:35,504 --> 00:59:36,971
I'm working on it.

1085
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:39,339
Put aside your differences.
We need to get to work.

1086
00:59:39,341 --> 00:59:41,341
We need to know what
the next move is gonna be.

1087
00:59:41,343 --> 00:59:44,944
We can't afford
any more surprises.

1088
00:59:44,946 --> 00:59:46,478
Yes, sir.

1089
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,120
Dr. Noah Murphy and I
will head back to Langley now.

1090
01:00:02,531 --> 01:00:03,498
I don't need your help.

1091
01:00:05,801 --> 01:00:07,000
Self-sufficiency.

1092
01:00:07,002 --> 01:00:08,969
I am so proud of you.

1093
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:12,172
You don't have the right.

1094
01:00:12,174 --> 01:00:15,375
Indeed, I failed you,
Linda, and I am sorry.

1095
01:00:15,377 --> 01:00:20,214
And to add insult to injury,
Elbe was an embarrassment.

1096
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:23,482
A mission to have first contact

1097
01:00:23,484 --> 01:00:27,422
that misses is like a boomerang
that just never comes back.

1098
01:00:28,924 --> 01:00:31,190
This one did.

1099
01:00:31,192 --> 01:00:33,527
Eh, a little too late.

1100
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:37,567
The powers that be don't share
the patience of scientists.

1101
01:00:40,035 --> 01:00:42,368
Then you ran away
from everything.

1102
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:44,938
Listen, Linda,
you and your mother

1103
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,841
were much better off without me.

1104
01:00:47,843 --> 01:00:50,544
Now, from
an empirical perspective,

1105
01:00:50,546 --> 01:00:53,413
you have to agree with me.

1106
01:00:53,415 --> 01:00:58,484
I'm not sure I concur
with your findings, doctor.

1107
01:00:58,486 --> 01:01:00,386
Be that as it may,

1108
01:01:00,388 --> 01:01:02,054
what we have on our hands now

1109
01:01:02,056 --> 01:01:05,194
supersedes any
of our personal issues.

1110
01:01:08,029 --> 01:01:10,096
I'm here at the request
of the government

1111
01:01:10,098 --> 01:01:13,199
to do whatever I can to help.

1112
01:01:13,201 --> 01:01:16,670
Look, your work
on cellular tracking

1113
01:01:16,672 --> 01:01:19,071
is groundbreaking, Linda.

1114
01:01:19,073 --> 01:01:21,875
At least it gives us
a fighting chance.

1115
01:01:21,877 --> 01:01:25,281
The question is how do we use
this information against them?

1116
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:32,085
I believe if they're
being controlled by a signal,

1117
01:01:32,087 --> 01:01:34,554
that that signal
can be interrupted.

1118
01:01:34,556 --> 01:01:37,891
Are you saying,
cut the transmission

1119
01:01:37,893 --> 01:01:39,725
and render them rudderless?

1120
01:01:39,727 --> 01:01:41,460
Of course!

1121
01:01:41,462 --> 01:01:44,129
That's to assume they have
no will of their own.

1122
01:01:44,131 --> 01:01:46,232
I believe Abraham does.

1123
01:01:46,234 --> 01:01:48,801
He's not acting with malice.

1124
01:01:48,803 --> 01:01:50,636
He only strikes when provoked.

1125
01:01:50,638 --> 01:01:53,540
Regardless, cutting
the cable is key.

1126
01:01:53,542 --> 01:01:59,411
I believe it's possible
to shoot a disruptive pulse

1127
01:01:59,413 --> 01:02:02,650
and cut right through
the alien beams.

1128
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:04,917
A bio-electric counter-measure.

1129
01:02:04,919 --> 01:02:07,721
Just a question of time.

1130
01:02:07,723 --> 01:02:10,259
Time we don't have.

1131
01:02:13,194 --> 01:02:15,495
Where are
the targets currently headed?

1132
01:02:15,497 --> 01:02:18,531
They appear
to be converging, sir.

1133
01:02:18,533 --> 01:02:20,266
Where?

1134
01:02:20,268 --> 01:02:21,567
Come on, man, where?

1135
01:02:21,569 --> 01:02:24,140
I don't know!
Washington, D.C.

1136
01:02:27,142 --> 01:02:28,611
That certainly
doesn't help matters.

1137
01:02:34,049 --> 01:02:35,949
But why?

1138
01:02:35,951 --> 01:02:39,121
Up until this point, they've
been moving independently.

1139
01:02:41,756 --> 01:02:45,357
Possibly, but whomever
is controlling them,

1140
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:48,361
the target makes
strategic sense.

1141
01:02:48,363 --> 01:02:50,163
With the Capitol in shambles,

1142
01:02:50,165 --> 01:02:52,000
the country tumbles
into chaos...

1143
01:02:59,507 --> 01:03:02,408
Possibly the world following.

1144
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:04,980
I don't believe
Abraham is a drone.

1145
01:03:06,915 --> 01:03:11,250
You've always had a special
deep affection for that simian.

1146
01:03:11,252 --> 01:03:13,021
Yeah, maybe I should never
have brought you here.

1147
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:20,359
If you hadn't, I would have
never became a scientist.

1148
01:03:20,361 --> 01:03:23,698
And for that,
I will always be grateful.

1149
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:30,804
But Abraham, he is not
like that Gila monster.

1150
01:03:30,806 --> 01:03:34,607
He wasn't exposed to the alien
toxins in the same manner.

1151
01:03:34,609 --> 01:03:37,511
But those toxins
were also injected

1152
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:41,714
directly into him
by your Russian partner.

1153
01:03:41,716 --> 01:03:42,651
She's not my partner!

1154
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:48,288
Nevertheless, he now has
more toxins, as you say,

1155
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:49,922
within his system,

1156
01:03:49,924 --> 01:03:54,527
toxins that my make him more
susceptible to alien command.

1157
01:03:54,529 --> 01:03:57,163
I believe that
his signal is weaker.

1158
01:03:57,165 --> 01:03:59,833
Abraham is resisting control.

1159
01:03:59,835 --> 01:04:03,502
You mean, you hope,

1160
01:04:03,504 --> 01:04:06,307
and hope, Linda,
is not a strategy.

1161
01:04:12,247 --> 01:04:15,617
Sometimes hope
is the only strategy.

1162
01:04:17,018 --> 01:04:18,650
[buzzing]

1163
01:04:18,652 --> 01:04:21,420
Doctors?

1164
01:04:21,422 --> 01:04:23,591
I think we've got a problem.

1165
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,196
ISS just sent us this video.

1166
01:04:33,134 --> 01:04:35,504
What were you saying
about hope?

1167
01:04:54,221 --> 01:04:56,325
<i>Did anyone else just see that?</i>

1168
01:04:57,424 --> 01:05:00,993
<i>My God, it's really happening!</i>

1169
01:05:00,995 --> 01:05:03,198
<i>Call the Pentagon, now!</i>

1170
01:05:05,834 --> 01:05:07,199
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1171
01:05:07,201 --> 01:05:08,868
<i>You must contain this.</i>

1172
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:10,337
What's going on?

1173
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,739
High alert.

1174
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:13,839
Abraham?

1175
01:05:13,841 --> 01:05:16,676
We're dealing
with spaceships now.

1176
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:19,245
Hovering over
the Pacific Islands.

1177
01:05:19,247 --> 01:05:21,114
They're heading towards D.C.

1178
01:05:21,116 --> 01:05:22,781
Abraham, the Gila monster,

1179
01:05:22,783 --> 01:05:24,317
the ship, all of them,

1180
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:25,819
they're heading towards D.C.

1181
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,087
And you know this because?

1182
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,721
There's no question.

1183
01:05:28,723 --> 01:05:30,890
And the alien mothership
is right behind them.

1184
01:05:30,892 --> 01:05:32,324
Based on our calculations,

1185
01:05:32,326 --> 01:05:34,025
they'll all be upon
the city in six hours.

1186
01:05:34,027 --> 01:05:35,495
Attacking the Capitol!

1187
01:05:35,497 --> 01:05:36,295
No.

1188
01:05:36,297 --> 01:05:37,864
Disrupting the chain of command,

1189
01:05:37,866 --> 01:05:41,167
giving them an opportunity
to organize a strike force.

1190
01:05:41,169 --> 01:05:42,935
And demoralize the nation.

1191
01:05:42,937 --> 01:05:46,406
<i>I don't think propaganda is
part of alien agenda, General.</i>

1192
01:05:46,408 --> 01:05:49,109
We will unleash
the unholy hell

1193
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,777
from the U.S. fighting force!

1194
01:05:50,779 --> 01:05:54,045
Your tank was wiped out
in one swift swoop, General.

1195
01:05:54,047 --> 01:05:56,315
Tanks are Tinker Toys!

1196
01:05:56,317 --> 01:05:58,185
Our new supersonic
cruise missiles

1197
01:05:58,187 --> 01:05:59,618
will punch enough holes
in those suckers,

1198
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:02,589
they'll wish they never
came to this planet!

1199
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:03,692
Gentlemen?

1200
01:06:05,192 --> 01:06:06,826
They're both from this planet!

1201
01:06:06,828 --> 01:06:09,462
The truth, sir, is we don't
know what Abraham will do.

1202
01:06:09,464 --> 01:06:11,531
He may not be under
total control of the aliens.

1203
01:06:11,533 --> 01:06:13,799
We have to assume the worst.

1204
01:06:13,801 --> 01:06:17,337
<i>What else can we do to
prevent destruction of city?</i>

1205
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:20,306
We've worked up
a bio-electric formula

1206
01:06:20,308 --> 01:06:22,442
that could interrupt
the alien transmissions

1207
01:06:22,444 --> 01:06:24,911
that control the creatures.

1208
01:06:24,913 --> 01:06:28,246
I'm requesting permission
to install the transmitter

1209
01:06:28,248 --> 01:06:31,051
on top of
the Washington Monument.

1210
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:32,419
That's great!
See to it.

1211
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:33,719
There's no time to lose.

1212
01:06:33,721 --> 01:06:35,554
Let's do it.

1213
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:37,589
It's the best chance
we've got.

1214
01:06:37,591 --> 01:06:38,826
Let's just hope it works.

1215
01:06:40,328 --> 01:06:41,797
He might be a genius.

1216
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:50,404
[Linda] <i>Delaney,
the transmitter has been</i>

1217
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:51,971
<i>attached to the monument.</i>

1218
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:54,375
<i>The signal will begin
broadcasting shortly.</i>

1219
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:57,344
[sirens blaring]

1220
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:01,181
Sir, we have a visual
on the target!

1221
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,614
Fire!

1222
01:07:02,616 --> 01:07:05,284
Give that monkey
all you got right now!

1223
01:07:05,286 --> 01:07:07,323
Over there!
Left quadrant!

1224
01:07:14,395 --> 01:07:16,295
Okay, thank you.

1225
01:07:16,297 --> 01:07:19,065
It's within the city limits.

1226
01:07:19,067 --> 01:07:21,033
How long before we transmit?

1227
01:07:21,035 --> 01:07:21,970
30 seconds.

1228
01:07:23,471 --> 01:07:26,640
You know, I used to dream
of living in a world

1229
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:30,312
where you touch the stars and
hold hands with those beyond,

1230
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:34,047
And I...

1231
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:35,982
I dream of you,

1232
01:07:35,984 --> 01:07:38,284
not my adopted daughter,

1233
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:40,888
my own flesh and blood
beside me.

1234
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:47,127
You got part of it right, Dad,

1235
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:48,663
maybe the most important part.

1236
01:07:54,069 --> 01:07:55,467
Dr. Murphy!

1237
01:07:55,469 --> 01:07:57,304
- Yes?
- Yes?

1238
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:58,870
Status, status?

1239
01:07:58,872 --> 01:08:00,741
The transmitter
is up and running.

1240
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,509
Eisenstein, how much longer

1241
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:06,478
until they're free
from alien control?

1242
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,149
I estimate the alien's beam
is at 11...

1243
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:11,616
no, 10% strength
over Abraham.

1244
01:08:11,618 --> 01:08:14,487
He is almost free already.

1245
01:08:14,489 --> 01:08:17,022
Abraham's still
holding about 10%.

1246
01:08:17,024 --> 01:08:18,292
Excellent.

1247
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:20,226
It's working, Dad.
You did it.

1248
01:08:20,228 --> 01:08:22,561
Well, we'll see, we'll see.

1249
01:08:22,563 --> 01:08:24,463
What's the timetable?

1250
01:08:24,465 --> 01:08:25,999
It's hard to say.

1251
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:29,002
If Abraham is in more
possession of his faculties,

1252
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:31,003
we might be able
to free him sooner.

1253
01:08:31,005 --> 01:08:33,539
Eisenstein says
we're at eight percent now.

1254
01:08:33,541 --> 01:08:35,475
Almost there...

1255
01:08:35,477 --> 01:08:36,711
What about the Gila monster?

1256
01:08:38,246 --> 01:08:40,312
He's resisting.

1257
01:08:40,314 --> 01:08:42,647
The transmitter must not be
able to reach him underground.

1258
01:08:42,649 --> 01:08:45,054
Eisenstein,
what's the percentage?

1259
01:08:48,756 --> 01:08:51,124
Alien control
of Gila monster

1260
01:08:51,126 --> 01:08:52,959
is holding at 90%.

1261
01:08:52,961 --> 01:08:55,093
90%? That much?

1262
01:08:55,095 --> 01:08:56,464
Damn it!

1263
01:08:58,465 --> 01:08:59,865
Patience, Linda, patience.
Give it time.

1264
01:08:59,867 --> 01:09:01,767
That's one luxury
we can't afford.

1265
01:09:01,769 --> 01:09:04,003
Eisenstein, please tell me
you know where this thing is.

1266
01:09:04,005 --> 01:09:06,371
Hard to say,
his signal is weak.

1267
01:09:06,373 --> 01:09:08,542
The Gila's signal has spiked!
It's about to emerge!

1268
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:11,843
<i>Excuse me?
Did I hear that right?</i>

1269
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:16,083
She said the Gila...
is about to emerge.

1270
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:17,484
Where?

1271
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:20,488
[roar]

1272
01:09:28,595 --> 01:09:30,765
[Gila monster roaring]

1273
01:09:54,855 --> 01:09:56,455
[roaring]

1274
01:09:56,457 --> 01:09:58,457
Gentlemen...

1275
01:09:58,459 --> 01:09:59,728
We have a new target.

1276
01:10:00,595 --> 01:10:03,029
I don't see Abraham!

1277
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:05,897
<i>Eisenstein,
what's Abraham's status?</i>

1278
01:10:05,899 --> 01:10:08,100
Abraham is completely
free from control!

1279
01:10:08,102 --> 01:10:11,036
But without alien signal,
his location is unclear.

1280
01:10:11,038 --> 01:10:12,304
Abraham is free!

1281
01:10:12,306 --> 01:10:14,539
But he must have run away.
We should do the same.

1282
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:15,740
Linda, you don't
need to be here.

1283
01:10:15,742 --> 01:10:16,776
You're not a soldier.

1284
01:10:16,778 --> 01:10:18,276
Damn right. Come on!

1285
01:10:18,278 --> 01:10:20,446
No.

1286
01:10:20,448 --> 01:10:23,383
I'm a scientist,
just like my father.

1287
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,284
Real cute, but now's
not the time. Come on.

1288
01:10:25,286 --> 01:10:27,587
Linda, let's get out of...

1289
01:10:27,589 --> 01:10:29,556
Wait a minute, do you hear that?

1290
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:30,792
[Abraham growls]

1291
01:10:37,131 --> 01:10:38,530
[Abraham screeches]

1292
01:10:38,532 --> 01:10:41,803
There he is!
Hit that ape!

1293
01:10:45,372 --> 01:10:47,306
No! Don't shoot him!

1294
01:10:47,308 --> 01:10:50,776
Stop! Abraham is no longer
under alien control!

1295
01:10:50,778 --> 01:10:52,311
Hold your fire on the monument!

1296
01:10:52,313 --> 01:10:53,678
Abraham is not a threat!

1297
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:57,016
I repeat, Abraham
is not a threat!

1298
01:10:57,018 --> 01:10:59,922
And we're making sure
of that, baby doll!

1299
01:11:03,657 --> 01:11:04,792
[roaring]

1300
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,526
Asshole.

1301
01:11:07,528 --> 01:11:08,828
Fire!

1302
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:10,463
Our countermeasure's
are over there.

1303
01:11:10,465 --> 01:11:13,633
That cowboy's liable
to bungle the whole show.

1304
01:11:13,635 --> 01:11:17,603
Come on!
Knock that bastard down!

1305
01:11:17,605 --> 01:11:21,143
Come on!
Blow him to smithereens, I say!

1306
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:26,148
I'll be dipped in pig shit!

1307
01:11:28,582 --> 01:11:30,249
[Eisenstein]
<i>I have bad news...</i>

1308
01:11:30,251 --> 01:11:33,555
<i>Alien beam has regained
control of Abraham.</i>

1309
01:11:34,822 --> 01:11:36,388
The longer the signal
is down,

1310
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:39,292
the more mindless and
destructive he will become.

1311
01:11:39,294 --> 01:11:42,495
Without the signal, we lose
the only chance we still had.

1312
01:11:42,497 --> 01:11:43,728
Tell me there's
another transmitter,

1313
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:44,731
prototype, anything!

1314
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:46,265
A prototype, yes,

1315
01:11:46,267 --> 01:11:48,535
but it's incomplete and
on the other side of D.C.

1316
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:49,936
It's too dangerous.

1317
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:54,774
It looks like I failed
you again, daughter.

1318
01:11:54,776 --> 01:11:56,575
<i>Sir, we've lost
General Delaney.</i>

1319
01:11:56,577 --> 01:11:57,910
<i>And the transmitter is down.</i>

1320
01:11:57,912 --> 01:11:59,512
<i>What are your orders?</i>

1321
01:11:59,514 --> 01:12:02,815
<i>What else can do to prevent
destruction of city?</i>

1322
01:12:02,817 --> 01:12:07,020
We can't save the city.

1323
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:09,922
Patch me through to Dr. Murphy.

1324
01:12:09,924 --> 01:12:13,426
<i>It's over. Get out of DC
while you still can.</i>

1325
01:12:13,428 --> 01:12:15,727
<i>We're gonna burn the whole
place to the ground.</i>

1326
01:12:15,729 --> 01:12:16,829
The hell with that!

1327
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:18,530
Now's not the time to give up.

1328
01:12:18,532 --> 01:12:20,600
Grab your car.
Meet me out front.

1329
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:22,134
What?

1330
01:12:22,136 --> 01:12:23,602
We're going after that device.

1331
01:12:23,604 --> 01:12:25,036
Have you lost your mind?

1332
01:12:25,038 --> 01:12:26,539
Do you not see what's
happening out there?

1333
01:12:26,541 --> 01:12:28,607
- We're toast!
- We're going after that device!

1334
01:12:28,609 --> 01:12:31,246
Now, Jones, go!

1335
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:34,213
Dad?

1336
01:12:34,215 --> 01:12:36,048
The transmitter
is in a black box

1337
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:37,851
in a white van
with a beacon

1338
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:40,119
at the top of the City Center
parking structure.

1339
01:12:40,121 --> 01:12:41,954
You can find it!
It's there!

1340
01:12:41,956 --> 01:12:42,754
Okay.

1341
01:12:42,756 --> 01:12:43,823
Then we got a chance.

1342
01:12:43,825 --> 01:12:44,856
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1343
01:12:44,858 --> 01:12:46,726
Wait! What are you doing?

1344
01:12:46,728 --> 01:12:47,793
I'm getting you to safety.

1345
01:12:47,795 --> 01:12:48,793
I'm not leaving you up here.

1346
01:12:48,795 --> 01:12:50,096
Linda, look around.

1347
01:12:50,098 --> 01:12:52,432
Inside, outside,
the danger's everywhere.

1348
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:54,100
I belong here.

1349
01:12:54,102 --> 01:12:56,168
This is the best vantage
point in the city.

1350
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:58,304
I can give you live updates
on the location

1351
01:12:58,306 --> 01:12:59,737
of the Gila monster and Abraham.

1352
01:12:59,739 --> 01:13:02,674
Go. Get the job done.

1353
01:13:02,676 --> 01:13:04,045
I'll be with you the whole way.

1354
01:13:27,402 --> 01:13:29,171
Get in the car.

1355
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:37,410
Hit it!

1356
01:13:37,412 --> 01:13:38,347
You got it, boss.

1357
01:13:41,382 --> 01:13:42,548
Whoa.

1358
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:44,950
Easy there, Bullitt.

1359
01:13:44,952 --> 01:13:46,651
I've been dying to do this.

1360
01:13:46,653 --> 01:13:47,986
Do what?

1361
01:13:47,988 --> 01:13:49,789
Drive like a maniac
with complete and utter

1362
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:51,226
disregard for all authority.

1363
01:13:55,595 --> 01:13:57,262
Don't get cocky.

1364
01:13:57,264 --> 01:13:59,767
The Gila monster still has the
authority until we cut his cord.

1365
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:05,437
Good thing they've already
evacuated this place.

1366
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,905
[roaring]

1367
01:14:06,907 --> 01:14:08,774
Isn't that
always how it goes?

1368
01:14:08,776 --> 01:14:10,442
Politicians go first
in their helicopters

1369
01:14:10,444 --> 01:14:12,344
while they leave
the rest of us here to fry.

1370
01:14:12,346 --> 01:14:16,548
She's doing what?
Get me Murphy!

1371
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:19,119
<i>What are you doing to help
contain this monster?</i>

1372
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,286
<i>You should be using
nuclear weapons.</i>

1373
01:14:21,288 --> 01:14:22,888
Speak of the devil.

1374
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:25,490
Murphy, I understand you're on
some kind of suicide mission.

1375
01:14:25,492 --> 01:14:26,758
Explain.

1376
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,393
Suicide is
not our intention, sir.

1377
01:14:28,395 --> 01:14:30,797
<i>A prototype of the device

1380
01:14:35,937 --> 01:14:37,369
Sounds pretty futile, Murphy.

1381
01:14:37,371 --> 01:14:39,004
Isn't there any other
course of action?

1382
01:14:39,006 --> 01:14:40,106
What's your father say?

1383
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:41,908
<i>Dad, what's your take?</i>

1384
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,043
[Noah] <i>Restore the transmitter,
cut the signal,</i>

1385

<i>and the destruction stops.</i>

1386
01:14:46,081 --> 01:14:48,313
<i>It might stop
the alien ship, too.</i>

1387
01:14:48,315 --> 01:14:49,214
My father concurs.

1388
01:14:49,216 --> 01:14:50,682
<i>Murphy, you make a good point.</i>

1389
01:14:50,684 --> 01:14:52,250
- [tires screeching]
- The road!

1390
01:14:52,252 --> 01:14:53,386
[growling]

1391
01:14:53,388 --> 01:14:55,890
He's right behind us.
Step on it!

1392
01:14:56,657 --> 01:14:58,190
Doing the best I can!

1393
01:14:58,192 --> 01:15:00,860
<i>Murphy!
Are you still there?</i>

1394
01:15:00,862 --> 01:15:02,861
For all intents and purposes.

1395
01:15:02,863 --> 01:15:05,063
<i>The device is
in an indestructible box.</i>

1396
01:15:05,065 --> 01:15:06,531
fitted with a tracking device.

1397
01:15:06,533 --> 01:15:09,602
It's our only hope
to gain the upper hand.

1398
01:15:09,604 --> 01:15:13,039
We have to find that device.

1399
01:15:13,041 --> 01:15:15,540
I like your spirit, Murphy.
Let's hope it's enough.

1400
01:15:15,542 --> 01:15:16,741
Do you need any support?

1401
01:15:16,743 --> 01:15:17,776
Troops or equipment?

1402
01:15:17,778 --> 01:15:19,512
Negative, sir.

1403
01:15:19,514 --> 01:15:23,348
I've got all the backup I need.

1404
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:25,383
Get the job done,
and God be with you.

1405
01:15:25,385 --> 01:15:27,619
Now you sound
like my father, sir.

1406
01:15:27,621 --> 01:15:29,754
I'll take that as a compliment.

1407
01:15:29,756 --> 01:15:31,225
<i>Marcos out.</i>

1408
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,660
Hang a right at the next light.

1409
01:15:34,662 --> 01:15:37,031
Right.
I said right!

1410
01:15:39,099 --> 01:15:40,967
Don't tell me where
to drive, by the way.

1411
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:43,203
I know this town like
the back of my hand, okay?

1412
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:44,169
All right, okay.

1413
01:15:44,171 --> 01:15:46,071
It's directly up ahead.

1414
01:15:46,073 --> 01:15:48,210
Park it... park it over there.

1415

[Gila monster roaring]

1416
01:15:52,413 --> 01:15:54,813
Sure about that?

1417
01:15:54,815 --> 01:15:56,316
Nothing's sure
in science, Jones.

1418
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:59,154
You know that...
until it's proven.

1419
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:06,357
It's up there!
Probably near the roof!

1420
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:09,427
Of course it is.
Great! Fantastic!

1421
01:16:09,429 --> 01:16:11,129
The Gila monster
is getting closer!

1422
01:16:11,131 --> 01:16:12,466
Hey! Wait, wait, wait.

1423
01:16:14,568 --> 01:16:16,270

Well, according to our readings,

1504
01:22:12,526 --> 01:22:15,326
the alien spacecraft has left
the atmosphere

1505
01:22:15,328 --> 01:22:17,929

certainly be happy about that.

Gila monster singlehandedly.

the gunships

Well, my dear,
I acted on something

1527
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:19,525
I haven't considered
since I was a little boy.

- Faith.

1532
01:23:30,638 --> 01:23:33,539
Well, we found a base
out near Santa Fe

1533
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:37,276
we think would be the perfect
sanctuary for him...

1534
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:40,915
For him to heal and for the two
of you to get reacquainted.

1535
01:23:44,218 --> 01:23:48,119
And, of course, it's the perfect
location for study.

01:23:48,121 --> 01:23:49,420
Study?

and by whom?

By you alone.
