1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000


2
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:10,402
Oh man...

3
00:01:22,976 --> 00:01:24,738
I'll be up in a bit.

4
00:01:24,739 --> 00:01:26,239
You better.

5
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,686
Larry?

6
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,820
What?

7
00:02:06,424 --> 00:02:07,863
That.

8
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:11,877
What's that box
doing in our bedroom?

9
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:12,678
Uh... I...

10
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,610
I don't know, maybe
one of the crew left it.

11
00:02:17,113 --> 00:02:19,623
- Why'd they do that?
- I don't know.

12
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:22,929
What is it?

13
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,313
A card,
"FOR THE COLLECTION"

14
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:30,517
Don't open it.

15
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,056
No!

16
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:44,324
Jesus...
Oh God!

17
00:05:57,961 --> 00:05:59,537
Is everything alright?

18
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:02,675
Uh... just about as good as new.

19
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:03,977
Oh yeah, Arkin?

20
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,705
After you look at the door upstairs, could
you get the last of the window bars up today?

21
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:09,365
Yeah, not a problem, sir.

22
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:11,809
I know we're in
middle of nowhere, but ...

23
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:14,744
Vicky still insists on Victorian decor.

24
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,350
CHASE JEWELLERS
MICHAEL CHASE - PRESIDENT

25
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,094
What shall I call you?

26
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:19,914
How about Jill?

27
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:27,788
Bye, Jill.

28
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:29,817
Hey!

29
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,340
I'm a mermaid.

30
00:07:32,542 --> 00:07:33,750
Okay.

31
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:35,975
I'm having a tea party,
Mr. Arkin.

32
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:39,121
- Oh well ...
- Would you care to join us?

33
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:43,071
Sure.

34
00:08:01,902 --> 00:08:04,368
It's... it's very good.

35
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:06,541
He made the tea.

36
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:09,600
Well, it's very good, sir.

37
00:08:11,305 --> 00:08:13,103
You have a very nice room,
Hannah.

38
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:14,648
This isn't my room.

39
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,313
- No?
- I'm a mermaid.

40
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:17,412
Okay.

41
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,934
Mermaids sleep in caves,
not rooms.

42
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:24,464
Can I ask you something?

43
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:28,705
If you were to really
want a present.

44
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:31,389
Something really special.

45
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,990
What would it be?

46
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:34,940
A baskin bear.

47
00:08:37,746 --> 00:08:40,757
Where would you get
a... baskin bear at?

48
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:42,426
Toy store.

49
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:44,235
Of course.

50
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:47,085
Whoa! Excuse me!

51
00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:50,736
- Is everything alright in here?
- Yeah um, she...

52
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,765
Hannah just uh... invited me
to her tea party.

53
00:08:56,848 --> 00:08:58,019
Is that right?

54
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,758
I'm sorry, sir.

55
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,244
I have one about her age.
A daughter.

56
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:04,943
Name's Cindy.

57
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,844
Oh...

58
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:09,974
- Okay well uh...
- Well, I got your door working.

59
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:12,210
Well, thanks.

60
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:14,484
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Arkin.

61
00:10:28,239 --> 00:10:29,376
Hey!

62
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:31,377
There's a wasp nest over there.

63
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:37,258
There's a wasp nest,
by the... by the greenhouse.

64
00:10:58,386 --> 00:10:59,678
Hey.

65
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:02,129
Let me bum a drag.

66
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,669
Sorry, I'm not adding
to your... delinquency.

67
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,570
What are you, a narc?

68
00:11:06,572 --> 00:11:08,106
Give me a drag.

69
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:17,173
Arkin, right?

70
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:18,474
Mm hmm.

71
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,226
What kind of name is
Arkin, anyway?

72
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:23,902
It's a first name.
What kind of name is Jill?

73
00:11:24,204 --> 00:11:25,756
It's my grandmother's name.

74
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:28,780
She was the first female
Attorney General in the State.

75
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:32,583
You're about to hear a fight.

76
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:34,290
You done somethin' ?

77
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:38,731
Yeah, but don't freak.
It's just a show.

78
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:40,804
You better gimme 
that back then.

79
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:43,453
I wouldn't wanna ruin
your performance.

80
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,135
Later, Arkin.

81
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:15,774
Nice try.

82
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:18,875
I told you mom,
I don't wanna go.

83
00:12:19,179 --> 00:12:20,206
You can't do this to me.

84
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:22,507
All of my friends are
staying here. I cannot go!

85
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:24,166
It's not an option!

86
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:25,867
You're going.

87
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:30,003
I'm not going on a
family vacation with you!

88
00:12:33,411 --> 00:12:34,812
Arkin.

89
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,984
- For the week.
- Thank you.

90
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:39,653
There is a little bit of extra there.

91
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:41,017
Oh, no, sir,
I can't take extra.

92
00:12:41,018 --> 00:12:42,875
No no, it's... it's for the
little one.

93
00:12:42,876 --> 00:12:44,476
I know how tough it can be.

94
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:47,442
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

95
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:49,145
You earned it.

96
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:51,970
Listen, spend as much time as
you can with them when they're young.

97
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,842
Something happens around age 13
and it get's kind of rough for awhile.

98
00:12:55,944 --> 00:12:58,977
What I understand?
Eventually they come back around.

99
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,598
Anyway, see you in
a couple of weeks.

100
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:05,099
Have a safe trip!

101
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,542
What you doing there,
baby girl?

102
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:37,546
Daddy!

103
00:13:37,547 --> 00:13:40,739
Shh... keep quiet for just a sec.

104
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:44,124
I've got someone who
wants to meet you.

105
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,526
Who?

106
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:51,218
He says you have
to close your eyes.

107
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:59,240
Alright, go ahead and 
open them.

108
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:04,631
Do I get to keep him?

109
00:14:04,632 --> 00:14:06,703
Of course you get to 
keep him.

110
00:14:07,904 --> 00:14:09,548
Do you have it?

111
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,249
Whoa.

112
00:14:14,158 --> 00:14:15,610
What is that?

113
00:14:16,012 --> 00:14:17,564
Daddy got him for me.

114
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,890
God damn it.

115
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,462
- Thank you Daddy.
- You're welcome, Cindy.

116
00:14:32,574 --> 00:14:34,635
Hey!

117
00:14:39,743 --> 00:14:41,362
You're supposed to
come by 6 hours ago.

118
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:44,075
Yeah, so I just got a bit
tied up at work, you know?

119
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:46,319
Do you or don't you
have the money?

120
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:54,677
Look, it's not as much
as I said, but...

121
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:56,109
it's something.

122
00:14:58,714 --> 00:14:59,800
What is this?

123
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:01,918
You promised you'd
get it by tonight.

124
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:03,221
I know,

125
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:06,181
but these jobs don't
just happen overnight.

126
00:15:06,182 --> 00:15:08,662
- I have to have it today.
- Why today?

127
00:15:08,963 --> 00:15:10,617
Because the people 
I owe want it.

128
00:15:10,818 --> 00:15:14,008
So why don't you let me talk
to the people that you owe?

129
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:15,958
They're loansharks, Arkin.

130
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,759
It's due. That's all there is to it.

131
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,227
- I'm leaving tonight.
- Where're you gonna go?

132
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:28,158
You gonna go to your Mom's?
Or your sister's?

133
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:31,513
And all this shit, what're you gonna do?
You gonna just disappear?

134
00:15:31,613 --> 00:15:33,372
They're gonna chase you!

135
00:15:33,674 --> 00:15:37,226
Look, I'm gonna get you
the money, alright?

136
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:38,784
No, it's too late.

137
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:40,685
No baby, come here.

138
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:42,893
Just give me until midnight,
alright?

139
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:49,494
Midnight.

140
00:16:20,538 --> 00:16:23,071
- Hello?
- Found what we're looking for.

141
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:25,040
I'm going in and I
gotta get paid tonight.

142
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:26,441
No way. On whose...

143
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:28,345
I'm coming over right now.

144
00:17:35,037 --> 00:17:38,104
You would've grown it to
a skin there, kiddo.

145
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:44,872
Now you've been casing
that family's house for months...

146
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:48,126
And now that you've found
the jewel broker's safe...

147
00:17:48,228 --> 00:17:50,029
You go to come in here.

148
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,695
With demands.

149
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,396
We settle tonight.

150
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:58,601
50% take.
The family is out of town.

151
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:00,616
The stone is inside,

152
00:18:00,717 --> 00:18:02,297
and I need to get 
paid tonight.

153
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,270
We got a routine.

154
00:18:05,373 --> 00:18:08,510
I pick the jobs.
You pick the locks.

155
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,074
We pick up the prize together.

156
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,775
That's the routine.

157
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:15,387
You don't change routine.

158
00:18:15,586 --> 00:18:16,765
That's when mistakes happen.

159
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:18,883
Tonight. Midnight.

160
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,463
No can do.

161
00:18:20,464 --> 00:18:23,018
I guess I'll find
somebody that will.

162
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:26,109
I run a...

163
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,110
smooth operation
out here.

164
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:30,428
You helped me on 
the inside.

165
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:31,731
You did.

166
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:33,893
But I never agreed
to your terms.

167
00:18:33,894 --> 00:18:36,694
Taking my help means
you did motherfucker!

168
00:18:37,494 --> 00:18:40,999
You don't come up here all
hopped up in your macho bullshit!

169
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,750
You need to be thinkin'
about that woman of yours,

170
00:18:45,452 --> 00:18:47,716
and that little pretty
girl of yours.

171
00:18:48,523 --> 00:18:51,470
Now...

172
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:54,171
What was that
request of yours?

173
00:18:56,276 --> 00:19:00,004
We settle tonight.
50% take.

174
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,864
You don't like
your fingers do you?

175
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:05,365
Huh motherfucker?

176
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,453
I am the only guy that you
know that can get into that safe.

177
00:19:09,454 --> 00:19:12,065
So you got a better option
than me? Then roll it out!

178
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:21,666
50.

179
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,727
40. You take it or leave it.

180
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:34,760
I guess I'll see ya
later tonight then.

181
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:19,158
"Just give me until midnight."

182
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:21,159
"Midnight."

183
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:47,192
Let go of me!
Please leave me alone!

184
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,629
You!

185
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:27,470
Why are you doing this?

186
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:31,142
Why are you doing this?

187
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:32,543
You son of a bitch...

188
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,307
You son of a bitch!

189
00:29:24,718 --> 00:29:26,351
Shit...

190
00:35:55,563 --> 00:35:58,033
Just stop! Stop!
Shh...

191
00:35:58,234 --> 00:36:01,334
Shut the fuck up!
I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you.

192
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:07,135
Michael, listen...

193
00:36:07,142 --> 00:36:10,205
I have nothing to do with this.
You gotta believe me, okay?

194
00:36:10,808 --> 00:36:13,175
There were... there were
tools down here right?

195
00:36:13,176 --> 00:36:16,818
- Where were they?
- I don't know, he took 'em.

196
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,805
Oh God!
Shh! Shh!

197
00:36:21,108 --> 00:36:24,998
My wife... my wife...
how... my wife...

198
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:26,607
Where... where's your wife?

199
00:36:26,608 --> 00:36:28,526
She's in there.

200
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:31,652
Where's Jill and Hannah?

201
00:36:31,753 --> 00:36:33,552
Jill left before he got here.

202
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:34,702
And Hannah is she in here?

203
00:36:34,703 --> 00:36:36,003
I don't know.

204
00:36:36,005 --> 00:36:39,406
God, I don't know...
I don't...

205
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:45,256
Okay, I'm gonna find 'em.
I'll find them. Calm down.

206
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,243
My gun ...

207
00:36:48,244 --> 00:36:50,566
It's the only way,
you have get my handgun.

208
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:53,343
You got a gun?
Where is your gun?

209
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:56,418
It's in the safe in my bedroom.

210
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,323
Behind the mirror.

211
00:36:59,026 --> 00:37:00,685
Bullets are in the bottom drawer.

212
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,889
What's the combination?

213
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,937
15 ... 24 ... 7.

214
00:37:06,938 --> 00:37:10,237
15-24-7, all right.
Just stay quiet.

215
00:37:10,238 --> 00:37:12,739
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

216
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:15,664
Oh God!

217
00:37:35,694 --> 00:37:38,507
Hey! Hey! I'm here to
help you. It's ok. Shh...

218
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:42,609
We're taking that
gag off okay?

219
00:37:50,621 --> 00:37:52,301
Yeah... yeah...

220
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,559
Can you get this off my eyes?

221
00:37:58,865 --> 00:38:01,033
Please ...

222
00:38:02,837 --> 00:38:07,368
Nah... Nah... listen,
I can't. I can't.

223
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:10,178
- Why?
- I can't take that off.

224
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:13,109
Have you seen Hannah?
Where's my baby?

225
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,182
I didn't see her. I don't
think she's in the house.

226
00:38:15,883 --> 00:38:19,182
No no... she's hiding.
He hasn't got to her yet.

227
00:38:19,183 --> 00:38:20,614
You have to find her.

228
00:38:20,615 --> 00:38:23,154
Okay, okay I will.
I'll keep looking.

229
00:38:23,155 --> 00:38:24,657
- My baby ...
- Shh!

230
00:38:24,658 --> 00:38:27,364
Victoria, I will.
I'll get her, okay?

231
00:38:27,365 --> 00:38:30,590
But listen, I need you to do
something for me, okay?

232
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:34,645
I need you to help me.
I'm gonna need you to scream.

233
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,948
Oh no... no no...

234
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:39,289
Listen, I just need a distraction
so I can get up there.

235
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,490
If I get up there,
I can find Hannah.

236
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:44,473
But I need to get upstairs.

237
00:38:44,896 --> 00:38:49,597
When he comes down here, stop
screaming so he doesn't hurt you, alright?

238
00:38:49,698 --> 00:38:51,699
Can you do that?

239
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,421
It's okay.

240
00:38:53,422 --> 00:38:56,304
I'm gonna get you out of
here but I need your help.

241
00:38:56,403 --> 00:38:58,816
I need to get up there.

242
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:00,566
- Okay?
- Okay...

243
00:39:02,971 --> 00:39:05,746
Give me just a second,
and then you start screamin'.

244
00:39:05,747 --> 00:39:09,263
- I promise you I'll be back.
- Okay...

245
00:40:56,881 --> 00:40:58,259
No!

246
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:55,460
There's no fuckin' bullets...
Where's the fucking bullets?

247
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,226
Hannah?

248
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,830
Hannah is that you?

249
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,878
Hannah?

250
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,147
Hannah is that you?

251
00:43:18,412 --> 00:43:20,030
Hannah?

252
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:28,331
- Get out!
- Who the hell are you?

253
00:43:29,737 --> 00:43:31,920
Larry Horn.

254
00:43:31,921 --> 00:43:33,474
Jesus ...

255
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,363
No... no...

256
00:43:36,963 --> 00:43:39,952
What does this guy want?
What... what does he want?

257
00:43:40,255 --> 00:43:42,226
He collects people ...

258
00:43:42,229 --> 00:43:44,789
No no, he's killing people.
He's killing them.

259
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:49,538
No no no, he only kills people
that he doesn't want.

260
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:51,227
The rest he takes.
He takes them.

261
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:52,981
Then why are you here?

262
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,584
I'm the bait.

263
00:43:57,686 --> 00:44:01,362
If you're not chosen, you'll
never leave this house alive!

264
00:44:01,363 --> 00:44:04,336
He only takes one!
He only takes one... no!

265
00:44:09,038 --> 00:44:11,739
No!
No!

266
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:25,395
Hey, it's me...

267
00:47:25,396 --> 00:47:26,598
Come here.

268
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,245
Let's get this off you.

269
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,746
Come on, get it off.
Get it off, come on.

270
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,464
I couldn't find Hannah anywhere.
I don't think she's in the house.

271
00:47:40,465 --> 00:47:42,268
She has to be here.

272
00:47:42,268 --> 00:47:45,176
I looked everywhere.
I didn't see her.

273
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,597
Where's Michael?
-He's okay. He's fine.

274
00:47:49,598 --> 00:47:52,831
After I get you out of here,
I'm gonna get him out of here okay?

275
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:56,878
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

276
00:47:57,079 --> 00:47:59,550
I gotta get outta here...
I gotta get outta here!

277
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:03,459
Please, one second...
One second...

278
00:48:11,368 --> 00:48:16,293
A robbery... I've prepared myself
for that but not this... not this!

279
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:17,559
I don't wanna die!

280
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,070
You're not gonna die!

281
00:48:19,071 --> 00:48:21,548
Shh... shh... You're not
gonna die. Shh... shh...

282
00:48:21,651 --> 00:48:25,144
- Hold still.
- And Hannah, gonna get Hannah.

283
00:48:25,145 --> 00:48:26,422
And Hannah too.

284
00:48:27,222 --> 00:48:29,191
Now listen, when we get
outta here,

285
00:48:29,192 --> 00:48:31,392
I'm gonna hide you okay?

286
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,718
You can't say a word, okay?

287
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:38,428
And when we go out of here,
you keep your eyes on my back.

288
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:41,411
Alright? Keep your eyes
on my back. Come on...

289
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,704
Why didn't you listen to me!

290
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:49,805
I told you to stay with me!

291
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:23,901
Shit.

292
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:46,827
Easy... you'll wake the neighbors.

293
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,859
What neighbors?

294
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,360
Hey.

295
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:53,861
Hey!

296
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:56,130
Jill, stop!

297
00:53:03,842 --> 00:53:05,606
Jill!

298
00:53:16,622 --> 00:53:18,383
Let's do it right here.

299
00:53:18,485 --> 00:53:21,618
I'm not doing it on
my front porch.

300
00:53:27,527 --> 00:53:28,797
Damn it.

301
00:53:28,898 --> 00:53:30,299
What?

302
00:53:31,401 --> 00:53:34,413
I think my mom
changed the locks on me.

303
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,023
You sure they're not here?

304
00:53:51,225 --> 00:53:52,567
Yeah, positive.

305
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:54,649
Let's go.

306
00:54:39,011 --> 00:54:40,978
Definitely not typical.

307
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:44,014
Who cares?

308
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,251
I don't think so.

309
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:05,329
Where do think
you're going?

310
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,177
I really think we
should do it right.

311
00:55:30,779 --> 00:55:32,159
Oh...

312
00:58:19,234 --> 00:58:21,568
911, please state
your emergency.

313
00:59:05,931 --> 00:59:07,374
Oh God no.

314
00:59:09,477 --> 00:59:11,175
Oh my God!

315
00:59:44,524 --> 00:59:45,748
Hey! Hey!

316
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,549
Don't make a sound!
It's me!

317
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:51,432
What are you doing here?

318
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:52,262
I'm gonna get you out of here.

319
00:59:52,263 --> 00:59:55,663
- Where is my family?
- Jill, you gotta be quiet!

320
00:59:55,665 --> 00:59:58,048
Look at me!
You gotta be quiet!

321
00:59:58,449 --> 01:00:00,049
Come on...

322
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,065
No... no...

323
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,166
No!

324
01:00:16,467 --> 01:00:18,467
Jill! Don't!

325
01:00:59,746 --> 01:01:01,808
Help me. Help me please!

326
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:06,953
You gotta push...
Help me here!

327
01:01:07,754 --> 01:01:09,154
Help me...

328
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,577
- Help me... please help me.
- You gotta help me push up!

329
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:20,842
No... no... no! Please don't leave me!

330
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:22,643
No... no... please...

331
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:27,093
No! No! Please! Please!
Please come back!

332
01:01:28,296 --> 01:01:30,024
- I'm sorry...
- Please come back!

333
01:01:30,326 --> 01:01:32,165
Please don't go!

334
01:02:39,761 --> 01:02:40,852
Run... run little girl.

335
01:02:40,853 --> 01:02:43,253
Run!

336
01:03:34,524 --> 01:03:35,971
Where the hell were you?

337
01:03:36,073 --> 01:03:38,713
Please, don't let
the man get me.

338
01:03:40,018 --> 01:03:43,323
We're gonna lose him now ok?
Now, would you listen to me?

339
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,847
- You gotta stay off the floor ok?
- I can do that.

340
01:03:45,849 --> 01:03:48,598
- Alright, you can do that?
- Yeah... yeah.

341
01:04:27,954 --> 01:04:29,488
Now!

342
01:05:05,341 --> 01:05:06,724
Damn it!

343
01:05:07,325 --> 01:05:09,226
Damn! Fuck!

344
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,271
The laundry chute!

345
01:05:34,775 --> 01:05:36,781
Does it go all the way down?

346
01:05:37,584 --> 01:05:39,678
I want you to get outta the way ok?
I'm coming right behind you.

347
01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:03,073
Just let her go.

348
01:09:04,078 --> 01:09:05,525
You got her father.

349
01:09:06,027 --> 01:09:08,815
You got me.
Just let her go.

350
01:09:09,418 --> 01:09:11,964
You never would've
found her anyway.

351
01:10:09,146 --> 01:10:10,725
Stay away!

352
01:10:18,635 --> 01:10:20,301
Where are you going?

353
01:10:21,103 --> 01:10:23,592
Is that all you got?
You little bitch!

354
01:10:28,202 --> 01:10:30,830
Is that all you got?
You fucking faggot!

355
01:10:33,736 --> 01:10:37,498
Is that all you got?
You little fucking faggot bitch!

356
01:10:42,106 --> 01:10:45,636
Come here you faggot!

the house.

376
01:14:44,028 --> 01:14:45,863
He's supposed to come
down the stairs okay?

377
01:14:45,864 --> 01:14:47,464
He's coming! Hurry!

378
01:14:53,872 --> 01:14:55,856

I'm gonna pull you up okay?

380
01:15:37,514 --> 01:15:39,510
What are you doing?

381
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,042
Come here...
You gotta help me.

382
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:23,600
It's broken.

383
01:21:15,722 --> 01:21:16,949
This guy, the exterminator.

384
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:19,550
He was the same guy working
earlier in the day right?

385
01:21:20,328 --> 01:21:21,888
And you saw his face?

386
01:21:20,889 --> 01:21:22,458

387
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:25,607
What happened
inside the house?

388
01:21:26,209 --> 01:21:27,746
Tried to save 'em...

389
01:21:28,847 --> 01:21:30,600
I really did...

390
01:21:31,705 --> 01:21:35,265
Sir? Company's called MASTER TRAP
EXTERMINATION. We got an address.

391
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:37,845
Pull him tight and get
him to the hospital.

392
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:11,793
What time is it?

393
01:22:16,602 --> 01:22:18,306
Just before midnight.

01:22:21,112 --> 01:22:22,537
I made it.

01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:24,440
What?

396
01:22:25,543 --> 01:22:27,286
I need you to
call my wife.

397
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:30,201
They'll take care of
all that at the hospital.

01:22:30,704 --> 01:22:33,294
