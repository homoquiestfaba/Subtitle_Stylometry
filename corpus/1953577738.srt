1
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,804
Hey, you guys hear of
the Dirty Sanchez?

2
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,981
It's good shit, good shit.

3
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,811
You're fingering a chick,
right?

4
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,885
Two, even three fingers.

5
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,046
When you slip
another finger right in her ass

6
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,751
and then, bang, you stop.

7
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,588
As soon as
she turns to see why,

8
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,287
you take
that special little finger,

9
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,263
and you wipe it
right across her upper lip.

10
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,035
She looks like
a damn Dirty Sanchez.

11
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,165
Gross, Alphonse.

12
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,767
Just your typical
disgusting chauvinist pig.

13
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,174
Dallas, baby

14
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,976
if you don't like
disgusting chauvinist pigs,

15
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,584
you're with the wrong crowd.

16
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:46,810
Exactly.

17
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,919
Dirty Sanchez.
That's fuckin' funny, man.

18
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,686
Hey, Fats

19
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,817
why don't you stop jerking
that camera off, man,

20
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,123
and start filming
these beautiful girls, huh?

21
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,322
Alright.

22
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:07,134
Debbie, what got you
into amateur porn?

23
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,171
Porn?

24
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,036
I'm just here to

25
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:12,008
have a kickass time
with my favorite girl.

26
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,349
We can't help
what gets caught on tape.

27
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,645
Yeah, but I can.

28
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,377
Here, let me tell you what

29
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,714
we're gonna do here, girls.
Okay?

30
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,685
We are gonna make history.

31
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,223
We're making a film.

32
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,293
Yeah, it's gonna have action.

33
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,417
It's gonna have drama.

34
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,995
It's gonna have
thrills and chills,

35
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,392
but mostly

36
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,327
it's gonna have a lot of sex.

37
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,962
Beautiful.

38
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,803
Now let's talk to Daisy.

39
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,363
Daisy?

40
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,171
Daisy?

41
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,268
Forgive her.

42
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,175
She's a little camera shy.

43
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,283
It's been a while since
you've seen one of those, huh?

44
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,525
Now here's Jimbo.

45
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,388
Hey, Jimbo

46
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,527
what the hell
are you dong here?

47
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,159
I don't know.

48
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,568
Alphonse was,
like, I need a van.

49
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,474
I was, like, I got a van.

50
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,778
And then,
he was telling me he was gonna

51
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,846
make nudie photos
with my sister,

52
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,240
and that's just not cool, man.

53
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:30,212
Next thing you know I wake up,
I'm in Mexico.

54
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,687
Keep smoking that stuff, Jimbo.

55
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,384
Next time you wake up,
you're gonna be in Africa.

56
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,427
Now let's get back to Dallas.

57
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,859
Dallas, what brings you to
the wonderful world of porn?

58
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,558
Let me tell you
something about Dallas, baby.

59
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,465
She may look like a damn troll,

60
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:47,801
but she can get her legs
so far behind her head...

61
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,931
How the hell would you know?

62
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,875
If I could do some of
the shit she pulls,

63
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,206
I'd never leave the house.
Yeah.

64
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:54,970
Dude

65
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:57,773
okay, dude

66
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,174
I'm telling you were
supposed to get on that freeway

67
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,211
like, 12 miles ago.

68
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,177
Which freeway?

69
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:02,804
The one.

70
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,007
Yeah, fat man, which one?

71
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,481
The one, dude.

72
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:08,451
There is only one freeway,
and it is the one.

73
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,822
You know I don't even see
Cabo on this map.

74
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,892
We're dying back here.

75
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,960
Yeah, can we stop?
I totally have to pee.

76
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:18,063
Do you see
somewhere to stop, huh?

77
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,495
Please. I really have to go.

78
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:21,122
You know what?

79
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,427
Why don't you girls
take a lesson

80
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,092
from Daisy back there. Huh?

81
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,204
Don't say a word.

82
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:25,997
She doesn't complain.

83
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,106
She just lays there with
her ass hanging out.

84
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,310
This map is a piece of shit.

85
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:33,742
Dude, what the, what,
what are you doing?

86
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,939
What? You know,
you know your way

87
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,073
around this crap hole country,
Fats.

88
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,343
We don't need a map.

89
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,884
What are you talking about?

90
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,715
Aren't you Mexican?

91
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,517
Yeah, but I was born
in Seattle, dude.

92
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,421
Whatever, still Mexican.

93
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,824
You know you could find
your way to a taco stand.

94
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,528
Hey,
look there's a gas station.

95
00:08:59,605 --> 00:08:59,969
Oh.

96
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:00,697
Right there.

97
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,775
Thank God. Can we please stop?

98
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,937
No way, chickadees.
We got places to be. Alright?

99
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,308
It's the first place
we've seen in

100
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,279
like, six hours.

101
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,381
Stop the van, Alphonse

102
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,510
unless you wanna swim
in my piss.

103
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,915
Stop the van now!

104
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,231
Okay boys and girls,
here we are.

105
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,042
You are a dick.

106
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,110
Hey, hey, hey.
I just didn't want my princess

107
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,772
to bare her precious tulip
in a craphole like this.

108
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:50,913
Hello?

109
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,516
Hello?

110
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:13,710
Damn it.

111
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,305
I smell gringos.

112
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,246
Dude!

113
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,512
Dude, that's the great
Diablo Negro mask, man.

114
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,349
And so it is, puny gringo.

115
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:30,418
El Diablo Negro, best Mexican
wrestler of all time.

116
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,226
Bullshit!
Nobody can beat El Tigre.

117
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,336
You creeps!
May I remind you,

118
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,903
I have to go to
the bathroom.

119
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,835
There's an outhouse
in the back.

120
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,305
I haven't used it in years.

121
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,707
Me, I just piss
against this wall.

122
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:50,382
Lovely.

123
00:10:55,087 --> 00:11:00,719
So, where you gringos headed
with such sweet cargo?

124
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,624
We got the beach, daddy-o.

125
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:09,030
Oh, beautiful.
Me, I ain't into that shit.

126
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,127
Too much pussy is
bad for your heart, amigo.

127
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,035
Blow, on the other hand

128
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,644
doesn't want you to call
the next day.

129
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:20,746
You know what I mean?

130
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,142
Precisely.

131
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,249
Hey, might you
be able to point us

132
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,476
in the direction
of the freeway?

133
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,988
You guys are nowhere
near that stretch

134
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,387
of dirt that we natives
call the freeway.

135
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,221
Dude, uh, where

136
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,794
where are we?

137
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:41,798
Well, we locals call
this the middle

138
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,526
of no-fucking-where.

139
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,330
That's where you are.

140
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,469
Fuck.

141
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,737
Amigo, don't feel bad.

142
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:58,009
If you have enough gas,
the town's about 100 miles.

143
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,742
A hundred miles?

144
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,252
Yeah, we ain't got
but 50 miles of gas, pops.

145
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,720
How 'bout these pumps?

146
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,051
Those?

147
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:07,759
They haven't pumped since

148
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,420
Mexico was Spanish territory.

149
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,856
Shit, you could
take that road south

150
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,662
but then you'd have to

151
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:21,569
drive by La Sengre De Dios.

152
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:27,371
La Sengre De Dios?
Dude, are you fucking serious?

153
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,946
It's real, amigo.

154
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,346
No way, man. No way.

155
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,214
You're...
you're messing with me, man.

156
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,547
That shit is not real.

157
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:39,385
Guys, guys, what in the fuck
are you talking about?

158
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,992
La Sangre De Dios.

159
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,651
La, what the fuck?

160
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:48,165
La Sangre De Dios,
the Blood of Christ.

161
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,791
It's this,
it's this old ghost town, man.

162
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,062
And they say that nobody's

163
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,105
lived there for,
like, 40 years.

164
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,139
So?

165
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,039
So, it's wherethey
put El Mascarado

166
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:02,272
after he gouged
a man's eyes out

167
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,642
with his bare hands.

168
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,647
What?

169
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,218
It's this legend, okay?

170
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,083
It's just this
old Mexican legend.

171
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,450
The thing
about Mexican legends is

172
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,959
that sometimes
they turn out to be true.

173
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,429
That's gotta be some real good
shit you got there, pops.

174
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,931
Find out for yourself.
For the road, amigo.

175
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:29,771
Now, if you take that road,
you'll find gas,

176
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:34,403
but do yourselves a favor.
Do not stop.

177
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,845
Just keep driving
'til you get there.

178
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,143
Do not stop for any reason.

179
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,783
Drive.

180
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,307
Hey, hey, man.

181
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,812
Where the hell are we?

182
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,276
Well

183
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,976
the natives like to call it

184
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:17,179
the middle of no-fucking-where.

185
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,457
How's that strike you?

186
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,060
And in the middle of

187
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,458
no-fucking-where
we got ourselves

188
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,157
the daddy-o of all locations.

189
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:27,788
Oh, yeah?

190
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,457
It's a, whoo

191
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:30,796
it's a ghost town.

192
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,336
Well, no,
it's not just any ghost town.

193
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,032
It's La Sangre De Dios.

194
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,143
It's where
they brought El Mascarado

195
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,141
after he went crazy.

196
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,040
Who?

197
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,806
El Mascarado.

198
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:47,749
El Ma-dude, dude, the best
Mexican wrestler of all time.

199
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,252
Ooh, was he cute?

200
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,650
Was he cute?

201
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:51,983
Who, El Mascarado?

202
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,251
Fuck, no. He looked like hell.

203
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,060
Alright,
he came out in the early '60s.

204
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,960
See, the President of
Mexico loved wrestling,

205
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,591
was obsessed with winning gold
at the 1968 Olympics.

206
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,930
Now the problem was

207
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,265
Russia was kicking
major ass at the time

208
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,499
and Mexico didn't
stand a chance, right?

209
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:16,013
But, then, out of the blue,
El Mascarado appears,

210
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,810
and, man, the guy was a badass.

211
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,148
Ooh! Yeah, tell 'em,
my burrito brother.

212
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:26,054
Yeah, the thing is,
this guy came out of nowhere.

213
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,159
I mean,
he didn't even exist before.

214
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,158
That's creepy.

215
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,455
Fuck, yeah, that's creepy.

216
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,190
And around the same time
he appeared,

217
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,928
three of the best Mexican
wrestlers disappeared.

218
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,233
They just, pff, vanished.

219
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,965
Now legend goes,
they all ended up

220
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,541
in the hands
of these scientists.

221
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:45,609
Scientists?

222
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:46,733
Yeah, dude.

223
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,144
Scientists hired
by the President,

224
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,840
and these guys created

225
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,078
the perfect wrestler

226
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,213
out of the missing dudes'
body parts, man.

227
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,658
Anyway, right before
the Olympic trial

228
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,057
something snaps.

229
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:07,359
El Mascarado starts killing
his opponents in the ring.

230
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,559
He became a monster,
just nuts, dude.

231
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,831
After that, details
get a little bit sketchy.

232
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,837
But rumor has it,

233
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,601
they brought him
to this small town,

234
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,007
out in the middle of nowhere,
to fix him up.

235
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,010
And the name of that town

236
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:26,776
La Sangre De Dios.

237
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,650
Okay, am I the only one
who noticed

238
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,256
the guy back there was crazy?

239
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,983
Oh, I know. I know.

240
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,857
But if La Sangre De Dios
is there, we're stopping.

241
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,988
You're Goddamn right.

242
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,343
Holy shit, dude.

243
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,209
Whoa, daddy! Check that out.

244
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,856
That's creepy.
I say we keep going.

245
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,958
Blondie,
did I bring you on this trip

246
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,582
to talk or to fuck, huh?

247
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,125
Look out!

248
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,996
Watch the damn road, idiot.

249
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,341
Whoa, yeah!

250
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:29,072
Ow, hey, hey, man.
Did you just fuck up my van?

251
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,182
Nah, it's all good, baby.

252
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,783
She's running smooth.

253
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,578
Smooth as a shaved bush.

254
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:49,332
Fuck!

255
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,999
Bravo. Bravo.

256
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,111
Hey, Fats, did you bring
those bolt cutters?

257
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,545
One step ahead of you, dude.

258
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,287
Ladies and Gentlemen

259
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,023
bitches and 'hoes,

260
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,600
I give you

261
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,260
the ghost town. Whoo!

262
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:32,534
Dude, it's fucking real.

263
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:37,411
Yeah, this is one hell
of a location.

264
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:29,633
Oh, man. Oh, man. This is...

265
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:30,735
What is it, my boy?

266
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:36,205
It's, it's fucked up, man.
This place is just fucked up.

267
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,576
This place better get ready
for some good hard core

268
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:46,309
crotch-on-crotch action.

269
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,918
Camera, huh?

270
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,720
Let's see what we got here.

271
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,370
Little ass smacking okay?

272
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,599
Just like that.

273
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,836
Just like that.

274
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,844
Just like that.

275
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,116
Okay.

276
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,241
Fats.

277
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,951
Fats! Let's go. Let's go!

278
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,613
We're losing light here.

279
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:31,021
Well, looky here, Miss Daisy.
What a surprise. Hi.

280
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:31,527
Hi.

281
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,927
Get in there.
Get in there, drunky.

282
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,995
Get your sweet ass up there.

283
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,999
Listen up, ladies.
Listen up. Alright?

284
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:42,470
You girls, you're waiting
for the plumber, okay?

285
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:47,068
He's not showing up,
and you're getting bored.

286
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,474
The plumber?

287
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,571
You are such a dork.

288
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,644
And, action!

289
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,818
That's it.

290
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,632
Yo, excuse me ladies.

291
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,298
Did somebody call a plumber?

292
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,041
Oh, yes, baby.

293
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,145
We're in desperate
need of your plumbing

294
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,079
Desperate.

295
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:40,988
Hey, guys.

296
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:51,397
Sweetie, you okay?

297
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:53,802
Grab a breath. Huh?

298
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,768
Hey, Daisy

299
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,540
Daisy?

300
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,974
Daisy, where...

301
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,840
where the fuck are you going?

302
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,115
Shit.

303
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,343
Hey, Fats, keep shooting.
Keep shooting.

304
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:08,510
Why the fuck are you stopping.

305
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,120
I'm rolling. I'm rolling.
I got some good stuff.

306
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,779
Good angles,
good, good angles there.

307
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:12,855
Fuck.

308
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,513
Alphonse

309
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,011
tell us when you knew
you wanted to make porn.

310
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:00,188
What the fuck kind of
question is that?

311
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,923
I never wanted to make porn.

312
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,323
You see, I wanted to be

313
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,827
the next Scorsese

314
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,558
but I came to realize,

315
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,895
there's just more money
in this business.

316
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:14,369
I mean, who gives a shit
about Taxi Driver today?

317
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,098
But Deep Throat?

318
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,234
Now, that's a fucking classic.

319
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,274
Where the hell you guys been?

320
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,376
Can we go now?
This place is creepy.

321
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,009
So soon?

322
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:30,451
My beautiful dolls?

323
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,080
Don't you
wanna see what the great

324
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,351
Mexican wrestler
here is packing?

325
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,460
Dude!

326
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,654
Okay.

327
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,320
He might not be a wrestler

328
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,762
but I'm sure
he knows a couple of moves.

329
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,060
Come on.

330
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,725
Dallas, Dallas

331
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,270
oh, you and Steve,

332
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:51,637
the wrestler
and the contortionist.

333
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,607
Yeah,
I'd rather put my own foot

334
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,871
up my own ass.

335
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,640
Whoa, dude. Check this out.

336
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,612
Yeah, I know, man.

337
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,877
No, dude. Check this out.

338
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,716
What?

339
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,984
Here, look. There's a shadow.

340
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,182
So?

341
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,793
So, it's not in this frame.

342
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:14,563
Yeah, that's the shadow cast
by my big dick.

343
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:17,892
No, dude

344
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:19,596
look outside the door

345
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,137
right outside the door.

346
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:24,169
There, there...

347
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,004
there's somebody else here.

348
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:28,471
Daisy?

349
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:29,602
No, look again.

350
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:30,680
Look again. Okay.

351
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,909
'Cause Daisy, Daisy goes,
Daisy goes out the door

352
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:34,950
right here

353
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:35,916
and then, it, right there.

354
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:36,418
You see that?

355
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,522
You see that?
There's a shadow right there.

356
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,451
Hey, hey

357
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,726
where is Daisy?

358
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,191
She's probably passed out
somewhere in this shit hole.

359
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,325
She took my weed, man.

360
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,664
Good boy, Jimbo. Go find her.

361
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,329
And tell her
if she's not back at the van

362
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,236
with her skirt up
in five minutes,

363
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,501
she can spend the night at the

364
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:01,339
uh, ghost town hotel.
Thank you.

365
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:27,699
What was I doing?

366
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:31,299
Daisy.

367
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,103
Daisy?

368
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,441
Whatever

369
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,514
feel some wicked
munchies coming on.

370
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,364
Can't believe she took my weed.

371
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,469
Where are those two assholes.

372
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:16,944
I warned them.

373
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,148
Fuck this.

374
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,222
What a day!

375
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,253
Fuck.

376
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:34,922
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck

377
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,590
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

378
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,326
You fucked up the van, man.

379
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,767
I did no such thing, daddy-o.

380
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,499
Dude! What, are,
you hit a rock the size

381
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,871
of my ass,
like, 20 feet from here.

382
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,502
Say one more word, fat man,
say one more fucking word.

383
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,346
Yo, pop the hood open.

384
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,275
Hey. Baby

385
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,387
baby, baby, hey.

386
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,752
Keep your panties on, huh?
What are you trying to do?

387
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,188
Hey, asshole

388
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,224
I'll let you know

389
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,260
that my daddy-o's
a mechanic, okay?

390
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,625
And I'm not
just a pair of tits on legs.

391
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:08,254
Now, if you don't mind?

392
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,965
Oh, I beg your pardon.

393
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:14,366
Excuse me.

394
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,946
Jimbo!

395
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,047
Jimbo!

396
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,028
Jimbo!

397
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,029
Hey, wh..., where is she going?

398
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,107
Steve

399
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:29,144
Steve

400
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,114
Steve!
Where are you going?

401
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,578
What the fuck
is up with everybody?

402
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,354
Where did she go?

403
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,095
Who the fuck knows?

404
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,200
Women are trouble.
That's all they are.

405
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:51,624
Yeah, dude.

406
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,532
Yeah. I mean,
you gotta put in all this work,

407
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,036
and then all you
get is more trouble.

408
00:32:57,675 --> 00:33:00,269
Fucking lights work
in the fucking ghost town?

409
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,538
What is the fucking story
of this place?

410
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,539
I'm telling you, dude,
if any of that story is true,

411
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:09,710
there is some real bad
mojo in this town.

412
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:10,513
Oh, and why is that?

413
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,314
What?

414
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,252
What?

415
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,414
Did you hear that?

416
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,489
There's, there's something
behind this wall.

417
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,799
Rats?

418
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,026
I don't think so.

419
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:25,665
Oh, fuck you.

420
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:31,402
It's you.

421
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:32,474
Yeah.

422
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,404
I thought
I saw Jimbo in the window.

423
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,307
Oh?

424
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:37,778
Yeah, it wasn't him, I guess.
But I can't find him.

425
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:38,813
Shh!

426
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,776
What?

427
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:42,078
That noise.

428
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:43,676
It's...

429
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,254
it's over there now.

430
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:46,987
Well, it's Jimbo.

431
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:47,716
Wait.

432
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,690
What is it?

433
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,828
I don't think we're alone.

434
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,064
I can't see
the van from here, man.

435
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,130
Hey, Fats, what do you say
we start heading toward

436
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,533
the van, man, huh? Huh?

437
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,704
We are. We doubled back
on the main road.

438
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,776
We're headed toward
the entrance of town.

439
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:41,909
Excuse me, sweaty Fats,
but you just know your way

440
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:43,411
around this fucking hell hole?

441
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,305
Dungeons & Dragons, man.

442
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:48,451
You're looking at
a level 14 warrior, here.

443
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,346
I made it through
Gauntlet's Maze

444
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,012
of Death in under six hours.

445
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,282
Jimbo!

446
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,558
Jimbo!

447
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:58,646
Jimbo?

448
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:32,647
Oh, my God.

449
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,018
Jimbo!

450
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:37,753
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

451
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,886
Oh, my God.

452
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:49,271
What the fuck happened to
his fucking face? Aw, shit!

453
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,635
His face is gone, dude?

454
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,209
Where is his fucking face?

455
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,811
It's El Mascarado, dude.

456
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:56,641
He took his face off.

457
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,177
What?

458
00:36:58,683 --> 00:37:00,116
That's what
Mexican wrestlers do

459
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,650
when they win a fight.

460
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,277
They, they rip their
opponent's mask off.

461
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,987
It's the ultimate humiliation.

462
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:11,493
Oh! You are fucking crazy,
fat man!

463
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,824
You are both fucking crazy.
I'm leaving.

464
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:18,129
I'm done.
Fucking fuck, fuck you,

465
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,396
fucking fuck

466
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,540
fucking faceless motherfucker.

467
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,742
Oh, shit!

468
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,992
Hey, some... some...
somebody's out there, man.

469
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,965
I told you, dude.
He is still here!

470
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,571
Who is still here, man?

471
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,588
Is he gone?

472
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,988
Christ! Woman!

473
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,428
You guys, hold the door.
Come on!

474
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,162
Yeah, hold the fucking door,
Debbie.

475
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,531
Hold the door. Hold it!

476
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,137
Shit, dude!

477
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:37,912
He's gone.

478
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:38,879
I think he's gone.

479
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,040
Go, go, go!

480
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:53,593
Oh, sh...

481
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,038
Open the door.

482
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,540
Dude, open the door.

483
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:06,734
You crazy?

484
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:09,004
You think I believe in
this sack of shit?

485
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,910
You're fucking crazy, fat man!

486
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:13,073
Open the door!

487
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,079
Open the fucking door, dude.

488
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,159
Go away.

489
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,056
Go away.

490
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,268
Stop banging
on my fucking door.

491
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:43,409
Steve?

492
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,193
Steve?

493
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:11,639
Fuck!

494
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,136
Fuck!

495
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,011
Fuck!

496
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:20,642
Shit!

497
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,008
Do you think he followed us?

498
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,479
No, we lost him.

499
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:18,793
God damnit!

500
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,490
Oh, are we gonna die?

501
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:25,500
No, no, we are getting out
of this town.

502
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:26,631
How?

503
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,702
I don't know.

504
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,868
What is this?

505
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:22,388
What are you doing?

506
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:23,424
Dude!

507
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,560
This is about El Mascarado.

508
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:47,039
Fif..., hol...

509
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,043
dude, they gave him, like,

510
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,053
50 lobotomies,
and it didn't help for shit.

511
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:16,978
They used human test subjects.

512
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,014
They, they used
people from this town.

513
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:20,912
They

514
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,042
oh, shit,
he killed them all.

515
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,280
He just tore them to shreds.

516
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:40,625
His, his only, his only, uh

517
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:45,235
objective is, uh, the complete

518
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,343
uh, dest...

519
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:48,843
destruction is, uh,

520
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:49,877
do, no entre

521
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:53,073
do not enter, quadrilateral.

522
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,385
His only objective
is to destroy

523
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:58,981
do not enter quadrilat...

524
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,784
Quadrilateral

525
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,280
Quad...

526
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:12,634
That's it.

527
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,034
That's it.
He follows the rules.

528
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:15,797
He what?

529
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,907
He follows the rules,
the rules of wrestling.

530
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:22,172
We're gonna retire
that son of a bitch tonight.

531
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:35,586
Steve!

532
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:37,289
No, it's okay.

533
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:38,784
It's okay. We got him.

534
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:40,021
I know how to stop him.

535
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:44,930
Shit!

536
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:49,397
Let' go.

537
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,864
Yeah, whoo.

538
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:24,974
Who's your daddy?

539
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:29,445
These never end.

540
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,339
Listen to me. Listen to me.

541
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:35,280
We have got to
take his mask off.

542
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:36,408
What?

543
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:40,149
Alright, look. Uh, the rules
of Mexican wrestling state

544
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,018
when a...

545
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:44,184
a wrestler's face is,
is revealed to the public,

546
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,956
he must retire
in humiliation forever

547
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:47,722
and never show his face

548
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,957
to the world again.

549
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,896
What are you talking about?

550
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:55,902
If we take his mask off,
he's done. He's finished.

551
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,942
How do we take
that thing's mask off?

552
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:03,373
That I don't know.

553
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,415
Holy shit!

554
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:17,354
I can't see anything.

555
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:28,761
What the fuck was that?

556
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,033
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

557
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:32,573
I, I've got a switch.

558
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:24,084
Oh, my God.

559
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:26,320
He's coming. He's coming!

560
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,590
Move, move!
Get away from the door.

561
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:37,868
Okay, I got it.

562
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,242
Okay.

563
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:41,344
We've got to get to the van.

564
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,342
I know.

565
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,338
What are we gonna do?
We gotta get out of here!

566
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:11,934
Holy shit!

567
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,537
Holy shit!

568
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:15,939
Quadrilatero

569
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,105
it's a ring.

570
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:21,616
It's a wrestling ring.

571
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,349
What are you talking about?

572
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,419
Oh, my God!

573
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:27,956
Oh, shit.

574
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:35,862
My God!

575
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:39,730
What...

576
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,741
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.

577
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:49,673
We're gonna die.

578
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:06,425
What are you doing?

579
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:08,689
Oh, no. Steve

580
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:09,799
what are you doing?

581
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:22,639
Steve!

582
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:25,043
Come on, you fucker!

583
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:04,549
Oh, no!

584
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:06,822
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

585
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,484
Oh, my God!

586
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:11,883
No, no!

587
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:17,863
No!

588
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:53,948
Hey, guys!

589
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:55,952
Hey, I fixed the van.

590
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,087
Where are you?

591
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,526
Guys

592
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,036
what the hell?

593
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:10,197
Hey, if you're not out here

594
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,864
in five minutes,
I'm gonna leave.

595
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,344
You hear that, Alphonse?

596
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:33,685
Where are you guys?

597
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:53,811
Hello?

598
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,371
Jimbo?

599
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:27,939
You guys can't be too far.

600
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,293
Guys?

601
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,603
Guys?

602
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:52,744
Shit

603
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:54,214
oh, shit.

604
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,132
Shit!

605
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:16,547
Steve?

606
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,509
You...

607
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:20,746
you gotta...

608
01:04:22,091 --> 01:04:23,922
you gotta take his mask.

609
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,222
Oh, what

610
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:28,326
it's okay, Steve.

611
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:29,590
It's okay. No!

612
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:31,665
Take...

613
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:34,395
his...

614
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:36,737
mask...

615
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:41,799
off.

616
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:26,848
Hasta la vista, you fuck.

617
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,995
And, and then, I'll start over,
rapping about

618
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:49,062
how he killed each character.

619
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,893
He's like,"I beat up Steve
in a record pace.

620
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:54,002
If you step to me, I'm gonna
take your face. "You know?

621
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,979
If you vulgar,
and you got no respect,

622
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:11,052
you're gonna end up
with a nail through your neck.

623
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:14,053
Alphonse, he's dead as hell.

624
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:36,508
I found Jimbo,
and that's all she wrote-a.

625
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:39,011
That's what you get
when you smoke the mota.

626
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,500
I'm going to remodel
my Mexican palace.

627
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:04,401
I'll wallpaper my rooms
with Debbie and Dallas.

628
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:26,686
I own this town from
the church to the steeple.

629
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:29,297
I made mincemeat out
of all the townspeople.

630
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,846
With his muscles
of steel and big cojones,

631
01:14:51,987 --> 01:14:54,421
El Mascarado heats up
my pantalones.

632
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:16,877
I took your life. Now I ta...
now I take your van.

633
01:15:17,012 --> 01:15:20,209
This is El Mascarado saying,
"Peace out, man."
