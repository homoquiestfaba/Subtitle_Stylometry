"The wretched pin with all

18
00:02:56,051 --> 00:03:00,347
Jesus, they couldn't feel
as rotten as he felt.

19
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,016
He made his way slowly.
A man hunched

20
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:04,143
at the wheel of a boat
glared at him from the sea.

21
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,520
The men took each other's
measure.

22
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,689
Turner was hunched over, too.

23
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,026
One needed a shave
as much as the other.

24
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,653
Their chins bristled with
a matching fury of whiskers.

25
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,447
Turner had another sack
in his hand,

26
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,158
"this one fatter than the last."

27
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:43,015
I read that.

28
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,600
Great book.

29
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,435
Full of adjectives.

30
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,604
Always the right one.

31
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,858
Florid, one reviewer said.

32
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,651
Well, there's an adjective.

33
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,571
You, on the other hand,

34
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,366
"remarkable," "fascinating,"
"awe-inspiring."

35
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,284
I never read my reviews.

36
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,245
Sign it.

37
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,708
Please.

38
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,173
Thank you.

39
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,262
Your door was closed.
I didn't want to disturb you.

40
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:23,388
Get lots done?

41
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,348
Lots and lots.
Hmm.

42
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,475
Lots of adjectives.
Good.

43
00:04:28,185 --> 00:04:29,728
Hello, lovebirds.

44
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,856
Leonard, can I have you up front
signing books?

45
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,027
You know, I'd forgotten
you'd written a book.

46
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,214
It's nice visiting them,
isn't it?

47
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,656
Like saying hello
to old friends.

48
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,825
She's hard on the next one.
Yeah, how's that coming?

49
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:45,744
It's coming splendidly.
Good.

50
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,287
You should take Sally to lunch.

51
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,164
I would love to.
Call me. Leonard?

52
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,498
Yeah.

53
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,349
Not a bad book
at all.

54
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,020
Hi, honey.

55
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,313
Don't let me forget
that my stuff's in the dryer.

56
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,524
How was the reading, Leonard?
Adequate.

57
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,693
It was marvellous.
Honey, what is this?

58
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,904
It's my stuff, Mom. Leave it.

59
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,240
You are not taking your clothes

60
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:26,367
to university in garbage bags.
You would.

61
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,745
You only have one chance
to make a first impression.

62
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,580
Well, there's a trunk
in the basement,

63
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:31,790
but it smells like mould.

64
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,834
Nice.
That's Mom.

65
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,669
Pack it away and forget it.

66
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,006
Good, excellent.

67
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,134
Look, perfect. There it is.

68
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,219
Ha, the old trunk from Hawaii.

69
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,055
We'll just dump it out
and dust it off,

70
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,140
it'll be great.

71
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,891
Inky! Oh!

72
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,561
It's my Inky that Dad won
at Punahou Carnival!

73
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,232
How is it that you remember
things about Hawaii so clearly?

74
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,484
I mean, seriously,
I remember a palm tree

75
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,444
every here and there.

76
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,113
I remember this.

77
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,699
You used to carry
this everywhere.

78
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,828
"It was King Kamehameha
who first... "

79
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,914
What?
It's... late.

80
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,793
Argh. Good grief,
what have you got in here?

81
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,048
Okay.

82
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,387
You sure you don't want us
to drive with you?

83
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,806
I'm sure.

84
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,601
Look after my mom.

85
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,187
Have fun.
I will.

86
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,315
- I love you.
- I love you.

87
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,235
If you need anything,
you call me.

88
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,610
Mom.

89
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,822
You need anything, you call me.

90
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,449
Go.

91
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,993
Drive safe.
I will.

92
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,322
You okay?

93
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,866
Yeah.

94
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,201
Yeah, I'm fine.

95
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:03,835
<i>"There's a statue outside the
courthouse of King Kamehameha,</i>

96
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,921
<i>who made the first laws
against murder in Hawaii.</i>

97
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,466
<i>He was the first here
to use witnesses</i>

98
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:12,135
<i>to pass judgment on the accused.</i>

99
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,722
<i>The law says you're presumed
innocent...</i>

100
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,393
<i>"...but the newspapers
say you're evil."</i>

101
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,924
Have a seat.

102
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,557
All rise.

103
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,020
Be seated.

104
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,527
Good morning, Your Honour.
Morning.

105
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,529
Good morning, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury.

106
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,908
What we are beginning today
must end in justice being done.

107
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,661
The State will prove
that on the night of June 19

108
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,038
of last year,

109
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,207
Theresa Nichol met Bobby Gordon

110
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,501
<i>at a nightclub in Waikiki,</i>

111
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,503
<i>where she lured him
into her car.</i>

112
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,631
She forced him to drive
her out to Hanauma Bay,

113
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,008
<i>intending to rob him.</i>

114
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,303
<i>You see, she had robbed men
this way before.</i>

115
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,180
<i>But on that night,</i>

116
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,516
on an empty stretch of beach,

117
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,102
she shot him.

118
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,854
<i>And she killed him.</i>

119
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,153
The State charges Theresa Nichol
with first-degree murder.

120
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,488
Juror number 11,

121
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,240
there are no notebooks
allowed in the jury box.

122
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,416
Go ahead, Ms. Maguire.

123
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,985
Aimee?

124
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,154
Danny?

125
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,038
Honey?

126
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,376
What are you doing under there?

127
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,752
Shh, hide-and-seek.

128
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,547
How long have you been
under there?

129
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,384
Never mind. I'm sure
Daddy's just about to find you.

130
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,344
We want everything
coming up roses.

131
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,804
Cool. Well,
when can we meet him?

132
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,098
Danny.
Yeah?

133
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,601
Oh, I will have the permits
by then, not a problem.

134
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,230
Yeah, we'll be taking a bath
in yen

135
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,565
before you know it, pal.

136
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:14,275
Alright, see ya.

137
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,361
What did
Mrs. Miller want?

138
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,238
Hmm. Is she gone?

139
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,198
I paid the rent last week.

140
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,282
Good.

141
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,077
Danny, Aimee's hiding
under the bed.

142
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,513
She thinks you're playing
hide-and-seek with her.

143
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,080
Will you please go look for her?

144
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,506
Ready or not, here I come.

145
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,177
I was picked for a jury.

146
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,304
How do they know who to pick?

147
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,474
Well, there's something
called a jury pool

148
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,976
and they ask people
all sorts of questions.

149
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,478
But if they don't like
your answers,

150
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,063
then they don't pick you.

151
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,981
They don't want
smart people, sweetie.

152
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,858
They want stupid people.

153
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,611
People that'll just...

154
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,613
kind of roll over
and do what you tell them,

155
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,864
think what you want
'em to think.

156
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,367
Actually, they didn't
want to pick me,

157
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,120
but the prosecutor ran out
of challenges, so they had to.

158
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,497
The whole system's
corrupt anyways.

159
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,165
I'm telling you,
you should've seen me

160
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,667
today down at City Hall

161
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,793
applying for those permits.

162
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,004
Everybody's got their hand out.

163
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,506
What permits?

164
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,760
What permits, Danny?

165
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,137
Hey, you know what's funny?

166
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,764
This Theresa, it says
in the paper

167
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,974
she liked to get down
after they roll the guys.

168
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:31,185
What's "get down"?

169
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,187
You have to ask
your mommy that, sweetie.

170
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,774
Actually, what am I saying?
She's the last person to ask.

171
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,359
Gotta go meet a guy.

172
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,699
Why did you come to Hawaii?

173
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:48,119
Why'd I come...
Uh, bill collectors.

174
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,247
Back in Arizona, bill collectors
knocking on the door.

175
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,458
And what did you
bring with you besides

176
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,627
your clothes and things?
Uh...

177
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,255
.38 calibre Smith and Wesson.

178
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,132
.38 revolv...
What else?

179
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,925
- Sorry?
- What else?

180
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,345
A knife. A Buck knife.

181
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,305
What did you call the knife?

182
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,056
Justice.

183
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,975
Why Justice?

184
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:13,978
Well, uh, well,
Theresa called it that.

185
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,814
You'd have to ask her.

186
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,566
After you moved to Honolulu,

187
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,735
what were you doing
to make a living?

188
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:21,944
I couldn't get a job.

189
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,406
Flat-out couldn't get a job.
I felt bad about it.

190
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,492
Did Theresa feel bad about that?

191
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,285
Objection!
Overruled.

192
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,580
Mr. Nichol,

193
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,333
did Theresa reproach you
for being unemployed?

194
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,002
You know, I just wanted
to support her.

195
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,920
I just... You know,
take care of her.

196
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,589
She deserved better.

197
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,467
So you started robbing people?

198
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,427
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,222
Yes, ma'am, but only people
who wanted to buy narcotics.

200
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,200
<i>I mean, Theresa even said,
What are the cops gonna...</i>

201
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,642
<i>What are they gonna say?</i>

202
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,894
<i>I wanted to buy some dope
and he ripped me off?</i>

203
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,937
You know, she made it
easy to live with.

204
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,315
When you say
"easy to live with,"

205
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,316
what do you mean?

206
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,109
Well, it's, it's...

207
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:07,782
It's... it's hard
to initiate violence.

208
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,535
You know, and it had
to be right, and, uh...

209
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,872
Well, she convinced me
that it could be right.

210
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,040
How did she convince you?

211
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,543
I loved her.

212
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,171
<i>He loved you...</i>

213
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,425
<i>but listening to him now,
it's hard to believe.</i>

214
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:29,554
<i>He looks at you
like you're a stranger.</i>

215
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,893
<i>I guess it's hard to remember
love when it's gone.</i>

216
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,064
<i>How there was a time when
you'd do anything for him.</i>

217
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,669
Tell her she'll have
her money next week.

218
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,045
But there's money
in the account.

219
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,422
No, there isn't.
What?

220
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,799
There isn't money.
Come here.

221
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,300
- What? What?
- Come here, come here.

222
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,927
What?
Tell her you're sick.

223
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,344
No, no, no, tell her, uh...

224
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,639
Tell her
Aimee's sick, Aimee's sick,

225
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,866
we spent the money on a doctor.

226
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,600
I-I can't lie to her.

227
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,812
Why are you
looking at me like that?

228
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,188
Where is the money? Like I'm
letting you down, or something?

229
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,023
It's tied up, okay?

230
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,627
In the property
with those business guys.

231
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,360
It'll be a couple weeks
and we'll have it.

232
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,171
Would you calm down?
How're we gonna pay the bills?

233
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,381
I don't know.
Call your mother.

234
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,990
I can't call my mother.
Yes, you can...

235
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,533
I cannot call my mother, Danny.

236
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,744
Okay, could you answer
the door, then? Please? Please?

237
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,251
I warned you about this.

238
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,339
I'm really sorry.

239
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,842
It's just...

240
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,385
Aimee's been really
sick this week,

241
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,846
it's just been rough.

242
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,975
But... next week, I promise.

243
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,477
Alright, next week.

244
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,165
<i>How was Theresa
acting towards Bobby Gordon</i>

245
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,917
<i>in the bar?</i>

246
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,545
Well, like he had a play coming.

247
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,964
What do you mean by that?
Well, I mean, you know,

248
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:30,090
not to be... not to be, uh...

249
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,220
<i>gross, but... like, romantic.</i>

250
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,638
<i>And what did you think</i>

251
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,931
<i>Theresa had in mind for him?</i>

252
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,766
Objection!
Overruled.

253
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,268
Your Honour! You'll get
your turn, Mr. Kahane.

254
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,855
Did Theresa tell you her plan?

255
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,524
I thought we were
gonna rob the guy.

256
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,777
<i>You know, that's what I
thought we were gonna do,</i>

257
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,459
<i>and he turned around,
and not to jump her,</i>

258
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,488
<i>nothing like that,</i>

259
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,740
and she shot him. She just...

260
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,408
she just shot him.

261
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,659
And what were you doing?

262
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,994
I was yelling,
I was freaked out.

263
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,429
I couldn't believe it,
I was, you know,

264
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,581
"What'd you do that for?!"
I...

265
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,374
What happened then?

266
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,001
I-I got in the car
and I took off,

267
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,794
I had to get out of there.
I just...

268
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,295
<i>I drove.</i>

269
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,840
<i>How did Theresa appear to you?</i>

270
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,675
- Objection!
- Overruled.

271
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,553
How did Theresa appear to you?

272
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,888
Like, uh...

273
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,682
Like, I do this
every day. Just...

274
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,100
Just calm.

275
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,037
I do this every day.
Looking at me, like, you know,

276
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,371
"What's your problem?"
I should be a man,

277
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,647
like I let her down
or something.

278
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,871
I'm gonna get fired
if we don't wrap it up.

279
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,706
Her lawyer's taking forever.

280
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,508
My father used to say
he spent his whole life

281
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,352
studying the law so that
12 people could think about it

282
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,711
for the first time.

283
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,546
I'll be happy to think
about the law

284
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,130
once we lock that woman up.

285
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,968
But we don't even know
if she did it.

286
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,095
Are you kidding?

287
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,513
If she didn't do it, who did?
Her guy?

288
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,182
And if he did it,
they'd have him on trial.

289
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,636
Look, we're not even supposed
to be talking about this.

290
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,315
You're not supposed to be
writing in that notebook.

291
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,859
Mr. Nichol.

292
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,363
Isn't it true
that prior to your marriage,

293
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,533
Theresa was a close follower
of the Mormon Church?

294
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,035
No, that's not true.

295
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,125
Wasn't it your idea
to start robbing tourists?

296
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,586
No, she came up with that
all on her own, come on.

297
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,090
Is it true
you stole your knife, Justice,

298
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,967
from a neighbour?

299
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,969
You see, right...

300
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,055
That's what I told
the detectives, right, but...

301
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,182
no, that's not true.

302
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,350
Oh, so you lied.

303
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,810
Definitely I lied.

304
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:48,062
I lied outrageously,
but that's when I was fighting

305
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,857
the-the-the robberies
and the murders, you know?

306
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,483
You were fighting them by lying?

307
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,069
Yeah, that's what
criminals do, you know?

308
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,654
Move it along, Mr. Kahane.

309
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,867
Mr. Nichol,

310
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,119
did you study law
while you were in prison

311
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,079
in California?

312
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,455
Yes, sir. Yes, I did.

313
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:08,749
Have you testified
in other court cases?

314
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,835
- Objection.
- Sustained.

315
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,336
The jury will disregard
the question.

316
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,713
Your Honour!

317
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,759
Mr. Nichol, were you
offered a deal

318
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,386
for your testimony at this trial?
No!

319
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,905
Watch yourself, Mr. Kahane.
Your Honour,

320
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,264
I am trying to establish
the witness's motivation.

321
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,226
Your Honour, I already pulled
life without parole in California.

322
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,602
Mr. Nichol...
Let him finish.

323
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,354
You know,
I got nothing to gain here.

324
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,149
I just want to see justice for
that kid she killed. That's it.

325
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:36,402
Your Honour, can I
continue with my cross now?

326
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,030
Counsel, approach the bench.

327
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,374
<i>Two days before
Bobby Gordon was killed,</i>

328
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,418
<i>Theresa and Vincent Nichols
robbed you.</i>

329
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,670
Where do you want me to go?

330
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,089
<i>They jumped my truck,</i>

331
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,924
<i>said, "Drive to the beach."</i>

332
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,095
<i>I think he thought
I was trying to get us lost.</i>

333
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,596
Who did?

334
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,224
She said he was her brother.

335
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:09,476
- Vincent Nichol?
- Yes.

336
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,478
Let the record
reflect that the witness

337
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,899
<i>is referring to Ms. Nichol's
husband, Vincent Nichol.</i>

338
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:16,984
My cam...
My camera's in the car.

339
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,861
Look at me, don't look at her.

340
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,988
<i>The guy, Vincent,</i>

341
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,990
<i>went to tie me up.</i>

342
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,742
And what was Theresa doing?

343
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,913
<i>She was holding the gun.</i>

344
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,748
<i>She looked...</i>

345
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,168
I don't know, blank.

346
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,463
<i>He had the knife.</i>

347
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,173
<i>He called it "Justice."</i>

348
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,092
Did he say why he called...
What kind of people

349
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,301
name a knife?

350
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,224
<i>My parents used to tell me:</i>

351
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,643
<i>"Don't get in trouble, because
we won't bail you out."</i>

352
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,603
<i>And I'd think:</i>

353
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,354
<i>Well, I'd never ask you.</i>

354
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,151
<i>I'd think: I can take care
of myself.</i>

355
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,823
<i>And then for a while,
I thought Danny would.</i>

356
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:08,202
Sally?
To what do I owe the pleasure?

357
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,121
You could've called me, Mom.

358
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,498
<i>Well, I did leave
a message several months back</i>

359
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,875
<i>with, um... uh, Danny.</i>

360
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,545
Don't pretend you can't
remember his name.

361
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,506
Has he found a job yet?

362
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,009
<i>Yeah, he's working
on a real estate deal.</i>

363
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,052
Oh, dear.

364
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,221
So, do you need money?

365
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,767
No. No, actually, I just
called to see how you were.

366
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,312
Are you taking care of yourself?

367
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,981
No cigarettes? Promise me.

368
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,108
<i>You sound just like your father.</i>

369
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,156
I miss him, Mom.

370
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,242
Yes.

371
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,995
Well, so do I.

372
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:02,798
Raise your right hand.

373
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,967
<i>Where is your family, Theresa?</i>

374
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,554
<i>There's no one here
in the court for you.</i>

375
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,805
I am.

376
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,183
<i>Who do you belong to now?</i>

377
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,394
Theresa, why did
you come to Hawaii?

378
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,939
It was going to be
our honeymoon.

379
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:22,193
I didn't know
we weren't going back.

380
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,029
Who named the knife Justice?

381
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,240
Vincent did.

382
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,825
And who decided
that you would start

383
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,577
robbing people?

384
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,871
Vincent made all the decisions.

385
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,710
Before you met Vincent Nichol,
were you religious?

386
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,171
I was raised Mormon.

387
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,298
I was a Sunday School teacher.

388
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,051
Your parents must have been
very worried about you.

389
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,596
They didn't want me
to marry Vincent, so...

390
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:53,933
when I did, that was kind of it.

391
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,643
During your time in Hawaii,

392
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,272
did Vincent ever threaten you
with bodily harm?

393
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,315
- Objection.
- Sustained.

394
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,194
Did you and Vincent argue?

395
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,904
- Yes.
- You fought.

396
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,616
Did he ever point
the gun at you?

397
00:24:11,409 --> 00:24:13,744
- Yes.
- Did it ever go off?

398
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,330
Yes, once.

399
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:18,600
The bullet went
right by my face.

400
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,000
Objection, Your Honour.

401
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,644
This line of questioning
is completely irrelevant...

402
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,503
Your Honour,
I'm trying to establish...

403
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,881
She's right, Mr. Kahane. Please
stick to the case at hand.

404
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,884
Theresa...

405
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,511
did you shoot Bobby Gordon?

406
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,013
I did not.

407
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,750
<i>It started just like
the other times.</i>

408
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,922
<i>Vincent asked Bobby
did he have a car.</i>

409
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,300
<i>Said he knew another
party we could go to.</i>

410
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,345
<i>But you didn't go to a party.</i>

411
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,305
<i>- No.
- No, instead,</i>

412
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:16,682
<i>you made him drive you out
to Hanauma Bay.</i>

413
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,309
<i>Yes.</i>

414
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:20,727
<i>Why?</i>

415
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,022
<i>There was never anyone around.</i>

416
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,524
Vincent said it was
his lucky spot.

417
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,909
<i>What happened
when you got there?</i>

418
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,496
<i>Vincent was mad,</i>

419
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,164
<i>because we didn't have any rope.</i>

420
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,748
Alright.

421
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,340
<i>And he robbed him?</i>

422
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:50,757
<i>Took all the money he had,</i>

423
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,010
<i>but it was only about $40,
I think.</i>

424
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,679
Hands behind your back.

425
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:01,352
Come on!

426
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,192
<i>Did you even see Bobby get shot?</i>

427
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:10,486
No.

428
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,945
Why not?

429
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,782
I had to put my boots on.

430
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,624
<i>I went back to the car.</i>

431
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,379
<i>Maybe Bobby said something
to Vincent, I don't know.</i>

432
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,297
<i>Sometimes Vincent got jealous</i>

433
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,590
<i>if he thought I was
acting too friendly.</i>

434
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,887
<i>You were at the car
when you heard shots?</i>

435
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,182
<i>Yes.</i>

436
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,393
<i>And what did you do then?</i>

437
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,024
<i>I couldn't even
hardly believe it.</i>

438
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,153
<i>I can't hardly believe it now.</i>

439
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,589
Okay, sweetie,
you're all tucked in.

440
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:14,341
Sleep tight, don't let
the bedbugs bite.

441
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,802
I want Daddy.

442
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,596
Well, you got me.

443
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,348
I love you, sweetie.

444
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,905
"You're so young."

445
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,241
A nice Mormon girl.

446
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,119
Vincent must have taken
your breath away.

447
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,204
Did you know he was dangerous?

448
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,624
"Is that why you fell
in love with him?"

449
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,792
Where have you been?

450
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,669
"Hawaii, the edge of the world.

451
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,922
You're Adam and Eve."

452
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:57,675
"Bonnie and Clyde.
No one for you but him."

453
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,637
Did you not see anymore

454
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,679
"that you could still get away?"

455
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,057
Wow.

456
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,101
That's so deep, Sally.

457
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,811
Let me guess.

458
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:09,914
You don't think
she did it, right?

459
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,357
It was his word against hers.

460
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,151
I knew it!

461
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,736
Only you, Sally,
could turn it all around,

462
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,864
twist it around,
and make it seem

463
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,283
like it's all the guy's fault.

464
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,410
Pfft. Is there anything to eat?

465
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,162
You missed dinner.

466
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,497
Oh, really?

467
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:31,251
Where have you been?
City Hall.

468
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,587
They won't grant the permits...

469
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,339
Can't tear the building down,

470
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,965
can't sell the property...

471
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,635
I don't understand.
Oh, you don't understand?

472
00:28:39,677 --> 00:28:41,070
Well, let me make it
simple for you.

473
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,596
I got screwed, okay?

474
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,824
So now you can go ahead
and tell me that you told me so.

475
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,310
But... if-if we can't pay the
rent, Danny, we can't live here.

476
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:51,813
So go. Go, please. Leave.

477
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,191
Where am I gonna go?
I gave up everything for you.

478
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,109
I-I left everything behind.

479
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,573
Poor Sally! Oh, poor Sally!

480
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,366
Poor little Sally!

481
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,368
Left her mommy and daddy behind,
did ya?

482
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,619
Huh?

483
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,830
Poor Danny has to live
with this!

484
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,846
Sally...

485
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,392
Hey, shh...

486
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:30,894
Be quiet, we don't
want to wake up Aimee.

487
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,650
I'm sorry, okay?

488
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,444
Sally, I'm so sorry.

489
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,112
I don't know why I do that.

490
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,030
I'm an idiot.

491
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,076
I'm trying. I'm really trying,
I am. You know that, right?

492
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,705
I love you.

493
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,836
You know I love you,
right, Sally?

494
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,800
I don't know why I do that.

495
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,430
I'm sorry.

496
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,773
I'm gonna go.

497
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,985
I'll pack up my stuff,
I'll just go.

498
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,447
I'll leave you two alone.
You'll be better off without me.

499
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,620
I'm just gonna go.

500
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,804
No.

501
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,516
Please don't go.

502
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:56,229
I'm sorry.

503
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,399
I'm never gonna do that again.

504
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,828
We could have another baby.

505
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,913
Another baby.
You want to do that?

506
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:17,626
<i>After Bobby Gordon's murder,</i>

507
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,419
did you leave Hawaii
with Vincent?

508
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,254
Yes, we did.

509
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,841
You went with him to California.

510
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:25,801
Yes.

511
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,512
You didn't leave him.

512
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,808
Even though you claim
that he had killed someone.

513
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,267
No.

514
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,854
Even though you claim
that you were afraid of him.

515
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:41,817
No. I mean, no,
I didn't leave.

516
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,193
Can you tell me why not?

517
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,404
We were married.

518
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,286
Did you write
this letter to Vincent?

519
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,122
Ms. Nichol?

520
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,542
I don't recall.

521
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,045
You don't recall?

522
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,273
You wrote this letter while
you were in California waiting...

523
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,298
Objection!

524
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,925
Withdrawn.

525
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,095
Could you read it out loud,
please?

526
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:16,685
"Honey, please don't
blame yourself"

527
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,144
for what happened.

528
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,147
You tried to keep me from it,
but I didn't

529
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,649
"want to leave."

530
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,984

letter from prison

531
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,614
when Vincent had no way
of reaching you.

532
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,074
No way of hurting you, correct?

533
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:33,911
Yes.

534
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,288
Nothing further, Your Honour.

535
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,421
If Vincent shot the guy,

536
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,257
why would she pack up
and go to California with him?

537
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,551
She was afraid.

538
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,511
Why would she be afraid?

539
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,181
Afraid to leave him.

540
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,934
Afraid of life without him.

541
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:58,936
She's not big on fear.

542
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:00,854
She's the one
that killed someone.

543
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,524
I don't think she did it.

544
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,025
Jeez...

545
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,576
Bye, sweetie.

546
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:19,665
Okay, bye.

547
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,583
See ya.

548
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,753
Wait, where are you going?
I'm going to meet some guys

549
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,588
about taking that property
off my hands.

550
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,674
But are you taking Aimee
with you?

551
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,051
Um, no, I'm not.

552
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,096
I have to go to court.

553
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,974
Yeah, well, okay...

554
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:38,684
figure it out, alright?
I gotta go.

555
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,019
Give me the keys.
No, Danny, you stay here

556
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,188
with Aimee. I have got
to go to final arguments,

557
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,773
it's the last day of the trial.

558
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,250
I'm not messing around,
give me the keys.

559
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:47,877
No, call and cancel
or stay here with Aimee,

560
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,444
I am leaving now.

561
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,363
Do not go out that door.

562
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,617
Sally.

563
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,312
Yeah, good.
I'm not gonna do this anymore.

564
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,856
Do what? Don't walk away
from me.

565
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,917
I won't do this anymore!
What's the matter with you?!

566
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,442
I'm done!

567
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,404
Mama?

568
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,408
That's good, that's great.

569
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,285
Come, baby. Come, come.

570
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:40,954
It's okay, sweetie.

571
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,958
Okay, let's go.

572
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,668
Hey, Sally.
Don't.

573
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,712
Come on, we gotta go.
We gotta go now.

574
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,087
Come on.

575
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,632
- I don't wanna go!
- Aimee.

576
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,219
Do me a favour, come here,

577
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,179
get in your car seat, okay.

578
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,199
Hop on in, hop on in,
quick, quick, quick.

579
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,475
We're late.
I don't wanna go.

580
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,644
Okay, there you go. Okay.

581
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,564
Come on, Aimee, sit still,
please!

582
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,987
I wanna stay with Daddy!

583
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,949
- Well, you can't.
- Not today, we gotta go.

584
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,542
All rise.

585
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,131
Be seated.

586
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,845
Mommy, stop pulling me.

587
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,180
I'm sorry, but we gotta...
We're late.

588
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,564
Why don't you sit
right here, sweetie, okay?

589
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,274
Sit here and colour.

590
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,234
Would you watch her
until first recess?

591
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,822
Juror number 11, you're late.

592
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,074
You are excused.

593
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:01,076
Juror number 11 will be replaced

594
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,535
with the first alternate.

595
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:11,086
Your Honour,
the prosecution requests

596
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,964
an evidential clarification
of the State's

597
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,966
evidence exhibit 13 A.

598
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,343
Mr. Gordon's shirt...

599
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,012
Mr. Gordon's sandals,

600
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:21,972
Mr. Gordon's pants...

601
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,815
Mommy, what now?

602
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:01,594
The jury had to be unanimous. It
took them less than two hours.

603
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:02,888
Guilty?

604
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,556
30 years!

605
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,766
The average felony sentence
in Hawaii

606
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,643
is four or five years.

607
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,104
Even mob killers
get less than 20.

608
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:14,107
Well, she must be out by now.
Parole, something.

609
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,943
She's still in prison
in California.

610
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,945
After all these years.

611
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:22,157
After all these years,
and you never brought it up?

612
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,201
I buried it.

613
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:29,915
Five minutes I was late.
I guess I felt...

614
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,541
Guilty?

615
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:36,337
Maybe I could stop

616
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,924
and visit Theresa
on my way to my mom's.

617
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,968
California is not
on the way to Kansas.

618
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,845
You think it's stupid.

619
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,681
No, I like it
when you get like this.

620
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:49,308
Like what?
Maybe this is your book.

621
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,936
Your next book.

622
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,197
<i>Dear Theresa,</i>

623
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,782
<i>I was on your jury in Oahu</i>

624
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,617
<i>many years ago.</i>

625
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,911
<i>I know it's been a long time,</i>

626
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,163
<i>but lately I've been
thinking about that,</i>

627
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,498
<i>and wondering how you're doing.</i>

628
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,876
<i>I had no idea
what happened to you,</i>

629
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,920
<i>but I made some calls,</i>

630
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,922
<i>and there you are in California.</i>

631
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,508
<i>I hope you don't find this odd.</i>

632
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,970
<i>Dear Sally... ...but I'm
wondering if I might visit you.</i>

633
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,115
<i>I received your letter,
and to say I was overwhelmed</i>

634
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,015
<i>is the understatement
of the year.</i>

635
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,644
<i>I want to thank you
so much for writing.</i>

636
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,646
<i>I don't get a lot of mail.</i>

637
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,522
<i>Or a lot of visitors,
for that matter.</i>

638
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,358
<i>I'm trying to picture you.</i>

639
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,528
<i>I wonder what you remember
about the trial.</i>

640
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,573
<i>There's so many things
I want to ask you.</i>

641
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,701
<i>I'm enclosing the forms
you'll need</i>

642
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,246
<i>if you want to visit the
next time you come through.</i>

643
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,374
<i>And don't worry, there
aren't any hard feelings.</i>

644
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:58,461
<i>I'm looking forward
to meeting you very soon.</i>

645
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,059
<i>I remember you.</i>

646
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:18,773
Thank you for sending
your book. It was...

647
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:19,983
interesting.

648
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,235
Well, I wrote it
a long time ago.

649
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,489
Uh, what can I get you?

650
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,366
Coffee would be great.

651
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,879
You look different
from what I expected.

652
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,589
Oh, well, the book,
the picture...

653
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,884
it was taken like 11 years ago.

654
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,678
Makeup, hair, doesn't even
look like me at all.

655
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,138
I didn't see your picture.

656
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:53,308
It was on the back jacket
of the book.

657
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,393
We're not allowed
hardcover books.

658
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,395
They rip the cover off
before we get them.

659
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,860
You look different
from what I remember.

660
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,195
That's what I meant.

661
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,739
Fancier.

662
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,370
Here, you try.

663
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,121
I'm not allowed
to touch the money.

664
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,042
I'm sorry.

665
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,132
I wonder why you came here now.

666
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,264
I found this old notebook

667
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,140
that I used to keep
during the trial.

668
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,226
I remember.
The judge took it away.

669
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,353
I remember you took notes
the whole way through.

670
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,521
It's the only way
I could see to get through it.

671
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,232
To write.
Yes.

672
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,486
Then you became a real writer.

673
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,782
And here I am.

674
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,744
When I started
to read the notebook,

675
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,788
it was like someone else
had written it.

676
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,999
I had forgotten all of it.

677
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,294
And I guess when I left,

678
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,711
I wanted to put it all
behind me.

679
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,256
Hawaii, all of it.

680
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,341
You should know...

681
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:13,096
I wasn't there at the end
for your deliberations.

682
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:16,433
I know. The last day,
you were late.

683
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,019
I couldn't leave my daughter.

684
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,939
I-I started to, but I couldn't.

685
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,067
It was complicated.
Don't worry.

686
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,195
I would've done exactly
the same thing in your place.

687
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,489
That's what mothers are for.

688
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,951
Yeah, but I think
I might've made a difference.

689
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,163
That's not why you came.

690
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,793
We were almost the same age.

691
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,212
I ran away to Hawaii
with my husband.

692
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,632
I went from my father's house
to my husband's house.

693
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,092
Just like you.

694
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:56,931
What about you?
You met Vincent...

695
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,312
He kept bugging me
about getting married, so...

696
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,647
one day I said okay.

697
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,359
I wanted to make him happy.

698
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,610
I wanted to make
everybody happy.

699
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,071
Next thing I know, it was done.

700
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,492
My parents didn't like Vincent,
so when I married him,

701
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,452
that was kind of it.

702
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,205
My parents were furious
when I married Danny.

703
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,581
I fought with my father.

704
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,001
He said if I left,
I shouldn't bother coming back.

705
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,880
He never forgave me.

706
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,466
He died the summer
before your trial.

707
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,387
My dad died in July.

708
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,056
He never forgave me either.

709
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,896
<i>"All of these
coincidences are amazing."</i>

710
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:48,024
<i>Her first job was at JC Penney's,
mine was at JC Penney's.</i>

711
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,527
I don't know why you want
to go on stirring up the past.

712
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:53,530
It was nice of you to come see your mom.
It's been a long time.

713
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,073
She's not really visiting me,

714
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,408
she went to see a murderer.

715
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,784
Oh, a real murderer?
Who'd he kill?

716
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,537
It's a woman, actually.

717
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,497
The prison's in California.

718
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:04,332
I'm just the stopover.

719
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,085
She says she didn't do it.

720
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,212
They all say that.

721
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,217
It's very In Cold Blood.

722
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:17,220
Right, but except
those murderers were guilty.

723
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:19,264
She's innocent?
Fantastic for the book.

724
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,307
Well, not totally innocent.

725
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,850
Sally, help me out here.

726
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:24,977
What do you think?

727
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:28,356
Well, she's not that
different from the trial.

728
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:30,649
The same things that sunk her -

729
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,486
the calm, the blankness -

730
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:36,072
now it almost seems reasonable,

731
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,907
as if it's the only
way to bear it.

732
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,577
So you think that's why they
convicted her, because she was calm?

733
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,120
I don't know. I wasn't there.

734
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,746
And do you really believe

735
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,165
that if you had been there
it would've made a difference?

736
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:48,625
It had to be unanimous.

737
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,254
So, what's the book?

738
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:56,259
We're connected.

739
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:58,428
My life to hers.

740
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:03,308
I can't figure it out,
but I want to know.

741
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,111
Hi, I'm here to see an inmate.

742
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,779
Theresa Nichol?

743
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,948
I wanted to bring
my notebook in with me.

744
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,243
They said I needed special
permission at the gate.

745
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:24,454
You're the one
that's been calling here.

746
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:25,955
The writer.

747
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,832
I'd like to be able
to make some notes.

748
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,543
Theresa Nichol?
Give me a break.

749
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,588
I mean, my husband's no
walk in the park,

750
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:37,049
but at least I go home
every night.

751
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,385
Wanna write a book about that?

752
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,188
Theresa never
gets in trouble. Perfect record.

753
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,565
Now you come along,
they're all over her.

754
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,109
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.

755
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,487
Theresa says you're gonna
help get her out of here.

756
00:44:58,488 --> 00:44:59,738
Good thing.

757
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,658
I mean, it's ridiculous.

758
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:04,118
I deserve to do the time.
I took a life.

759
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,995
Well, he was a mean
son-of-a-bitch.

760
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,875
My roommate.

761
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,918
- What did she...?
- Shot her husband.

762
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,255
Most of the lifers here
are in for something like that.

763
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,468
She's been here 28 years.

764
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,720
Had a mastectomy this summer,
chemo,

765
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,932
radiation...
They won't let her out.

766
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,854
I don't want to die in here.

767
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,900
You know, those dogs can
turn the lights on for you,

768
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,569
lock the door?

769
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,112
Inmates train them
to help disabled people.

770
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,449
How come you're not
in the dog program?

771
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:44,909
I just don't want it, you know?

772
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,579
Even to pet them,
because then you're stuck.

773
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,914
You can't be happy again
without each other.

774
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:53,585
When I first moved out,
I had this little beagle puppy.

775
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:56,629
Man, I loved that little guy.

776
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,840
Vincent made me get rid
of him when we went to Hawaii.

777
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:03,844
Where is Vincent now?

778
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,515
From the time he was 14,
he's only been out of jail

779
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:08,974
a few months.

780
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:12,144
I honestly believe
if he'd been free longer,

781
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,022
he would've had a following
and more people would've died.

782
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:16,899
A following like a cult?

783
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,611
He told me he could
read my mind.

784
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,904
My face was like an open book.

785
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,158
It's weird that I believed him.

786
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,287
Well, you were in love with him.

787
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,289
You know,

788
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,166
in most states, the husband
can't testify against the wife.

789
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,918
But they can in Hawaii.

790
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,963
Because they changed the law
that summer, just for me.

791
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,965
They were gonna get me
no matter what.

792
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,175
Vincent failed a polygraph,
you know.

793
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,137
Well, they didn't
say that at the trial.

794
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,556
You being a few minutes late
was very convenient for them.

795
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:50,642
That judge wanted you
off the jury.

796
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:54,771
I think there's a reason
you came back into my life now.

797
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:56,582
When you wrote me
how your father was a lawyer.

798
00:46:56,606 --> 00:46:59,400
Yeah, but I'm not a lawyer.
You're a writer.

799
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,490
I'm sorry.

800
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:09,327
I think I misunderstood.

801
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:19,211
You're gonna stay up all night
again looking at porn?

802
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,423
No, I'm coming in soon.

803
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:25,092
Look, she was right.

804
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,844
Hawaii changed the law
about spousal testimony

805
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,180
right before her trial.

806
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,823
You out of your mind?
You can't start buying

807
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,350
all her conspiracy theories.

808
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,519
Look, Leonard, I know

809
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,103
her theories are crazy, but I...

810
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:37,896
But?

811
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,107
I have to find Vincent Nichol.

812
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:43,778
He's in prison.
He's been in prison

813
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,531
all but 18 months
of his entire adult life.

814
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,700
- Why?
- I don't know.

815
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,660
No, I mean why find him?

816
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:52,911
Because he's the only one
who knows what really

817
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,373
- happened that night.
- What about Theresa?

818
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,000
Sally...

819
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,044
have you even asked her?

820
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,034
How you doing?

821
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,370
Good.
Good, good, good, good.

822
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:40,084
I took a writing class
once in here.

823
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,088
The teacher wasn't half
as good-looking as you are.

824
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:50,678
"Write what you know,"
that's what they told us.

825
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,430
Same as therapy.

826
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:53,972
It's all about what you know.

827
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,933
What about what you want
to know, writer lady?

828
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,020
Like what I said in my letter,

829
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,065
I was on the jury
at Theresa Nichol's trial.

830
00:49:03,107 --> 00:49:05,401
Right, right, poor old Theresa.

831
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,195
Why do you say poor Theresa?

832
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:10,573
Can't please all people
all the time, right?

833
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,825
Is she still good-looking?

834
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:17,288
Yeah, well, that's her thing.
Pretty girl.

835
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,956
It's like a charm.

836
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,586
Everybody wants to do
for a pretty girl.

837
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,382
I'm just interested
in the truth.

838
00:49:28,424 --> 00:49:30,008
You know what
they told us in therapy?

839
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,928
About how, uh...

840
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,597
criminals want to blame
everybody else.

841
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:37,475
Like Theresa?
We're talking about me here!

842
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,394
You want to blame
everybody else.

843
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:42,772
No, no, no, that was before.

844
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:45,107
I don't make victims
out of people anymore.

845
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,068
So, Theresa was a victim.

846
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,779
Come on...

847
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,282
She loved it.

848
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,954
You know all about that,
don't you?

849
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,458
Maybe I do know.

850
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,629
Maybe that's why I don't think

851
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:08,482
you told the truth about
what happened that night.

852
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,549
Look at you.
Yeah.

853
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,593
You look at me.

854
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:15,972
You look at me, and you look
at that little girl.

855
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,852
What do you think happened?

856
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:23,395
She's serving a life sentence
for a murder

857
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,314
based solely on your testimony.

858
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,985
Well, that's, uh...

859
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,403
You see, to me, that's funny,

860
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,280
because the cops made
a real big stink

861
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:36,200
about how they didn't
believe a word I said.

862
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:38,744
And at the trial, everybody!

863
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,955
Everybody ate it up.

864
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,458
Why did you testify?

865
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:48,796
Hoping for a break,
shot at parole.

866
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:51,716
Surprise, surprise.

867
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,344
They, uh, screwed me.

868
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,726
Does Theresa deserve to be free?

869
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,398
It's a joke that
that girl's incarcerated.

870
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,693
Now, that's what you
should write in your book.

871
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,487
Because...?

872
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,700
What do you think?

873
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,828
I think you shot Bobby Gordon.

874
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,455
Well, there you go.

875
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,293
Guess this therapy works
pretty good after all.

876
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,843
Happy birthday, Grandma!

877
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:37,678
Happy birthday!

878
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,472
Yeah!

879
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,058
Well done.

880
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:43,818
Get the cake knife, please.
Are you alright?

881
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,353
I'm fine. Cake knife, please.

882
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,522
In the silver drawer.
Okay.

883
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,152
Uh, excuse me.

884
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,988
Grace sent me here
for more liquor.

885
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,949
Oh, right. That was supposed
to be my job.

886
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,033
Help yourself.

887
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:02,703
Uh, well, actually, um...

888
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:05,873
the-the really good stuff
is here.

889
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,751
You must've worked
with my father.

890
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,253
And you must be Sally.

891
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:12,588
I'm John Emory.

892
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,674
Oh, my God. John Emory, yes.

893
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,593
Yes.

894
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,011
Right.

895
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,638
Yeah.

896
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:24,266
Y-y-you... you're not, uh,
having cake?

897
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:26,602
Uh, no, I'm, I'm...

898
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,395
just a bit preoccupied, I guess.

899
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,272
Oh, with the murder.

900
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:33,358
Right. Your mother tells me
you're obsessed.

901
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,403
Oh, well, my mom is mystified.

902
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:39,824
But this woman went to prison
for a crime she did not commit.

903
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:43,035
My prisoner, Theresa Nichol.

904
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:46,122
Her husband was the only one
who testified against her.

905
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:48,833
And now he's saying that he's
the one who pulled the trigger.

906
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,669
Well, that, that...
that might help you

907
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,462
at a parole hearing.

908
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,171
But to get the judge
to reopen the case,

909
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,882
that's next to impossible.

910
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,260
You'd have to... you'd have to
prove a miscarriage of justice.

911
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,363
You'd have to prove the trial
was rigged against her.

912
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,682
- Well, it was.
- Well, you know that?

913
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,267
Yes, I was there.

914
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,020
Well, I'll tell you what.

915
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:11,438
You send over the files,
and I'll have a look at them.

916
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,650
Great, thank you.

917
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,740
He's an old friend
of my father's.

918
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,660
Friend, enemy, defence lawyer.

919
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:29,581
Well, you pretty much
missed the party, Mom.

920
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,333
I'm sorry, honey.

921
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,585
It's just that this John Emory
could really help me out.

922
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,839
He's everything a lawyer
should be. Open-minded,

923
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:39,884
forgiving; he was nothing
like my father.

924
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,218
An open mind
is a relative thing.

925
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,262
It always seemed to me

926
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,640
that it was you who could
not forgive your father,

927
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:48,726
not the other way around.

928
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,540
<i>Dear Sally,</i>

929
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,500
<i>I've been thinking about
where you live</i>

930
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,419
<i>and how you live.</i>

931
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,005
<i>Trying to picture you
up there in Canada.</i>

932
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,133
<i>I've been thinking
about you working,</i>

933
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,801
<i>writing away.</i>

934
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:26,346
<i>And I think someday maybe I
could have a place like that.</i>

935
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,058
<i>To write and be alone.</i>

936
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:33,353
<i>Dear Theresa,</i>

937
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,148
<i>thank you for sending
the transcripts of the trial.</i>

938
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,526
<i>I haven't written a lot because
there's so much to read.</i>

939
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:43,030
<i>Did I actually listen to all
these millions of words?</i>

940
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,622
<i>I think about that,</i>

941
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:53,540
<i>looking for a place to live,</i>

942
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:55,375
<i>something I've never done.</i>

943
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,377
<i>And what about the rest?</i>

944
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,258
<i>Getting a job, making friends.</i>

945
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:05,010
<i>There are so many things
I don't know how to do.</i>

946
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,638
<i>Sometimes, that scares me.</i>

947
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,182
<i>I probably need your help.</i>

948
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:13,894
<i>I hope that's okay.</i>

949
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:18,065
<i>When I first came
to Canada with Aimee,</i>

950
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:21,944
<i>that's what I wanted too:
a new life.</i>

951
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:24,738
<i>Everything new
so that I would be new.</i>

952
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,619
<i>I like to close
my eyes and think about</i>

953
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,412
<i>that room to write in,</i>

954
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,206
<i>how I would decorate it.</i>

955
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,250
<i>How I would spend my time there.</i>

956
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:39,377
<i>How it would be entirely my own.</i>

957
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,089
<i>Sally, I'm so grateful
I met you.</i>

958
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,467
<i>It frightens me,
but I can't wait</i>

959
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:46,885
<i>to get out of here.</i>

960
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,348
<i>It's funny,</i>

961
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,810
<i>you write to me
about the future,</i>

962
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:58,563
<i>and I'm just now
getting started on the past.</i>

963
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:10,826
<i>And what was Theresa doing?</i>

964
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:12,828
<i>She was holding the gun.</i>

965
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,331
<i>She looked...</i>

966
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:18,125
<i>I don't know, blank.</i>

967
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:23,896
<i>Did he tell you why
he called it Justice?</i>

968
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,175
What kind of people
name a knife?

969
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,660
Mr. Sneed?
Yes?

970
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,662
My name is Sally Linden.
I...

971
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:58,040
Thanks, I'm not interested.

972
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:01,377
I was on the jury for the
Theresa Nichol murder trial.

973
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,714
You testified.

974
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,674
I'm writing a book.

975
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:10,219
All I got is instant coffee.

976
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:14,014
The bachelor way.

977
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:17,559
Half of the time, I make it
with hot water from the tap.

978
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:20,354
You know Theresa Nichol
is still in prison?

979
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:23,232
Good. I hope she dies there.

980
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:26,610
But at the trial you testified
that she looked blank.

981
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,362
Did you think she was scared?

982
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:30,572
I said she looked blank?

983
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,324
Yeah.

984
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:36,161
Let me show you something.

985
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,040
It's so long ago. Still...

986
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:42,334
there's some lessons
you don't need to learn twice.

987
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,044
How's that?

988
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:46,004
That's the last time
I let a pretty girl

989
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:47,881
get one over on me.

990
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:50,050
They took my camera, you know.

991
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,886
Police found a pawn shop
ticket on...

992
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:57,641
What was his name?
Vincent.

993
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:01,853
They held it for evidence
in the trial, but...

994
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,522
when I finally got it back...

995
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,611
Does she look blank?

996
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:12,448
Does she look scared?

997
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,284
They're having the time
of their lives.

998
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:18,203
You said you're guilty about
the five minutes you were late.

999
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:20,372
Well, what about her?

1000
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:21,999
What about the...

1001
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,293
five minutes she held the gun
on that poor

1002
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:26,003
son-of-a-bitch they killed?

1003
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,046
That's five minutes she didn't
run out in the road

1004
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:29,756
and yell for help.

1005
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:32,301
That's five minutes she didn't
turn the gun on her husband.

1006
00:58:46,522 --> 00:58:48,817
Hi, Mr. Emory.

1007
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,862
Yeah, I filed the writ.
I think we've got a case here.

1008
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,197
<i>Great.</i>

1009
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,157
Did you know that
Vincent Nichol failed

1010
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,283
a lie detector test?

1011
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:57,701
And they still let him testify.

1012
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,995
<i>Yeah, they let him testify.</i>

1013
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,830
The State allowed him
to perjure himself,

1014
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,248
they encouraged it.

1015
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,875
But why?

1016
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,668
<i>Vincent offered them
a murder, a story.</i>

1017
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,504
<i>He said Theresa wouldn't talk.</i>

1018
00:59:08,544 --> 00:59:11,089
Why would he do that?
Offer it up?

1019
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:13,842
He cut a deal, he cut a deal.
He got immunity in Hawaii,

1020
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,261
which left only one person
to swing for it, so...

1021
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:17,804
<i>They needed to convict someone.</i>

1022
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:19,806
Yes, and he was hoping
it would help his case

1023
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:22,309
in California where he was awaiting
trial for the other murder.

1024
00:59:23,394 --> 00:59:25,812
What? I'm sorry,
the other murder?

1025
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,483
Yeah, for the Ernesto Navarro
murder.

1026
00:59:29,525 --> 00:59:32,110
The other one, the second one
in California.

1027
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:36,532
<i>Oh, so you lied.</i>

1028
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,116
Definitely I lied.

1029
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:40,011
I lied outrageously,
but that's when I was fighting

1030
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:43,414
the-the-the robberies
and the murders. You know?

1031
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,208
<i>Sally?</i>

1032
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,334
After the first killing,

1033
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:49,627
Theresa left Hawaii
with Vincent,

1034
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:52,381
<i>fled to California.
Two weeks later,</i>

1035
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:57,010
Vincent shot and killed
this guy named Ernesto Navarro

1036
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:59,471
while Theresa looked on.

1037
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,265
<i>You didn't know this?</i>

1038
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:07,563
I... cannot believe
she would do this to me!

1039
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,898
Really, Sally,
she didn't do it to you.

1040
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,983
Don't do that.
Do what?!

1041
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:14,694
Be smug! Superior!

1042
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,988
What are you gonna do?
If you're gonna go down there,

1043
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,116
you have to visit your mother.

1044
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,825
Why? So she can say
"I told you so"?

1045
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,512
You do whatever you want.
You're a grown-up.

1046
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,138
But your mother's sick,
and it's on the way.

1047
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,373
California is not
on the way to Kansas.

1048
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:27,916
Right, right.

1049
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,337
Why did you only ship me
evidence from the Hawaii trial?

1050
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:33,922
I've served sentence
for my involvement

1051
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:37,134
in the California crime.
Involvement? Theresa!

1052
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,986
California law doesn't care
who pulled the trigger.

1053
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,805
I was convicted of felony murder
just for being there.

1054
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:44,099
That's not the law in Hawaii.

1055
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,603
Then Vincent told them
I shot Bobby Gordon.

1056
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,230
Vincent. It's always Vincent.

1057
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:53,275
Theresa, you knew what he was.
You left Hawaii with him,

1058
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:55,777
you went to California with him,
but you didn't leave him.

1059
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:57,695
He said he would kill me.
Did you even try?

1060
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,615
I did try.

1061
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,992
<i>I tried in California.</i>

1062
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,244
<i>Thought maybe he could
drive me away.</i>

1063
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:14,004
Drive, drive, go!

1064
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:30,539
<i>But Vincent wouldn't let me go.</i>

1065
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:32,123
<i>He couldn't.</i>

1066
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,750
<i>He always said he could
tell what I was thinking.</i>

1067
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,962
<i>So I thought it was my fault.</i>

1068
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,257
I tried to get away,
and that man died.

1069
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:45,429
There was nothing I could do.

1070
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,305
Nowhere I could go.

1071
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,641
After that,
I didn't ask for help.

1072
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,142
Until I came along.

1073
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,811
I never asked you for anything.

1074
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:56,898
You came here, you wanted
to write your book.

1075
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:00,110
The book.

1076
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,487
That's right, I wanted
to write my book.

1077
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:06,533
Goodbye.

1078
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,828
Mom?

1079
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,538
I'm here.

1080
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,585
Mom?

1081
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,387
Mom?

1082
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,931
Sally.

1083
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,267
Mom, I'm calling an ambulance.

1084
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:17,354
No, no, no, no.
Just stay with me, sweetie.

1085
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,362
Mom. I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have...

1086
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,322
I've been so wrapped up,
I haven't...

1087
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,115
No, no, it's alright.

1088
01:04:29,157 --> 01:04:30,742
It's alright.

1089
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:32,828
I'm glad you're here.

1090
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:38,041
I'm tired of being sick.

1091
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,837
Just stay with me.

1092
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,647
<i>I've thought over and over,</i>

1093
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:02,458
<i>trying to figure out
maybe there was something</i>

1094
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:04,067
<i>different I could've done.</i>

1095
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:08,572
<i>I'm still thinking about that.</i>

1096
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,494
<i>I've been thinking I wish
there had been something to do</i>

1097
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:42,021
<i>or I'd been thinking
more clearly at the time.</i>

1098
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:49,153
<i>I wish I'd not been
so powerless.</i>

1099
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:05,128
<i>I've thought about it a lot
since my last hearing,</i>

1100
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:07,505
and in the last many years.

1101
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:10,842
I've thought about
the whole thing a lot,

1102
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,260
and I didn't

1103
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:15,012
enjoy being involved
in the crimes.

1104
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:19,559
And I didn't enjoy
the intimidation and the fear

1105
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:21,269
that I felt with him.

1106
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:35,408
<i>Dear Sally,</i>

1107
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:38,620
<i>my parole hearing was today,
and I was shaking so bad</i>

1108
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,747
<i>I could barely
get the words out.</i>

1109
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:50,381
<i>It didn't really matter
in the end.</i>

1110
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:07,941
<i>I haven't had a letter from you.</i>

1111
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:10,485
<i>I guess I might not
have one again.</i>

1112
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:13,029
<i>But I wanted to say thanks
for everything,</i>

1113
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,656
<i>and for visiting me.</i>

1114
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:16,908
<i>I'll miss you.</i>

1115
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:31,798
I shouldn't have read it.

1116
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,638
I don't need it.

1117
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:42,017
I've given up on the book.

1118
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:51,484
"Hawaii, edge of the world."

1119
01:07:51,526 --> 01:07:53,570
You're Adam and Eve,
Bonnie and Clyde.

1120
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,405
No one for you but him.

1121
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:57,198
Did you not see anymore that...

1122
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,867
"you can still get away?"

1123
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,288
Florid?
No.

1124
01:08:11,046 --> 01:08:12,630
I didn't know...

1125
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,675
any of this.

1126
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:19,888
That's because
I didn't tell you.

1127
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,308
That's what we do in my family.

1128
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,395
Pack it up and forget it.

1129
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,573
I've been thinking
about these...

1130
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:42,326
little moments that
determine our lives.

1131
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:48,124
The minutes when things
can go either way.

1132
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,966
I walked out
of that courthouse...

1133
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,678
and I had Aimee by the hand.

1134
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:05,600
She was looking up at me.

1135
01:09:05,642 --> 01:09:07,978
"What now, Mommy?"

1136
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:13,357
All I could think of to do...

1137
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:20,364
I went back into the courthouse,
I called my mom.

1138
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:25,244
She said...

1139
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:27,204
she would wire me money

1140
01:09:27,246 --> 01:09:29,499
for plane tickets
that afternoon.

1141
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:33,169
She told me to come home.

1142
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,972
Yeah, open number three.

1143
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,322
I didn't think you'd come back.

1144
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:03,783
I didn't know that I would.

1145
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,786
I'm so sorry about your mother.

1146
01:10:07,954 --> 01:10:09,706
I heard you were denied parole.

1147
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,792
Yes.

1148
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,128
I talked
to John Emory last night.

1149
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:16,880
The lawyer?

1150
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:20,550
Yeah, a judge in Hawaii has
granted the writ of habeas corpus.

1151
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:23,094
He's going to reopen your case.

1152
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:25,429
And Vincent's gonna get
on the stand and tell them

1153
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,015
what he told me.

1154
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:29,266
I can't believe it.

1155
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,897
Theresa, I need to know
what happened that night

1156
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:35,356
at Hanauma Bay.

1157
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,361
I testified very truthfully
at my trial.

1158
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:42,989
You believe that at least?

1159
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:45,867
I believe you told us the facts,

1160
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:47,994
but the truth is something else.

1161
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,751
I went back...

1162
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,755
to start the car,
and then Vincent just...

1163
01:11:00,255 --> 01:11:02,217
<i>shoots him.</i>

1164
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,260
Shoots him, and I can't...

1165
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:07,847
believe it, I'm...

1166
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,477
<i>I'm standing there
and I can't move.</i>

1167
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:17,190
And it's awful.

1168
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,195
But...

1169
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:29,119
It's all mixed up
with love and...

1170
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:33,081
everything I should do,
but...

1171
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,626
<i>What I think is...</i>

1172
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:39,045
<i>how it's only Vincent and me.</i>

1173
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,381
We've only got each other.

1174
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:55,561
<i>How could I... have loved him?</i>

1175
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,191
<i>How could that have been me?</i>

1176
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:04,154
How did I get in the car
and leave that boy

1177
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:06,030
lying in the sand?

1178
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:11,535
And then we were driving,
and I...

1179
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:14,164
I knew it was wrong,
but it was...

1180
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:15,706
Too late.

1181
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:18,334
Hey.

1182
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,925
Theresa...

1183
01:12:25,967 --> 01:12:27,384
I sat at your trial.

1184
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:30,221
I watched.
I thought I understood...

1185
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,349
that it was wrong.

1186
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:35,226
That you should've left
Vincent, done anything

1187
01:12:35,268 --> 01:12:37,145
to get away from him, but...

1188
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:38,813
I knew why you didn't.

1189
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,191
How?

1190
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:43,776
Because we were alike.

1191
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:55,038
We weren't so much alike
then, were we?

1192
01:12:57,248 --> 01:12:59,416
I mean, you left.

1193
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:31,448
Did you know that Vincent Nichol

1194
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,326
failed a polygraph?

1195
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,997
I don't recall.

1196
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,500
Did you know...

1197
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:44,712
why he agreed to testify
against his wife?

1198
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:48,799
It's a long time ago.

1199
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,885
I don't recall.

1200
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:54,347
There were only three
witnesses to the murder,

1201
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:55,973
and one was dead.

1202
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:58,160
But it wasn't enough for me
to show that Vincent was lying,

1203
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,436
I needed the jury
to understand why.

1204
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:02,772
Vincent Nichol made a deal.

1205
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,440
Immunity in Hawaii.

1206
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:06,901
In California, he was hoping
for a chance at parole.

1207
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,403
He had everything to gain.

1208
01:14:08,443 --> 01:14:11,364
So the prosecution
knew about this deal?

1209
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:12,615
They did, sir.

1210
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:14,117
Did they tell you
about the deal?

1211
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:16,702
No, they told me
the opposite was true.

1212
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:19,289
Vincent said under oath
he had nothing to gain,

1213
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:21,207
and they let it stand.

1214
01:14:21,249 --> 01:14:22,959
Even if this is true,
Mr. Emory,

1215
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,544
it's probably not enough
to throw out a murder.

1216
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,522
With all due respect,
Your Honour, I'd have argued it

1217
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,465
completely differently
if I had known.

1218
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:33,010
It would've made my case.

1219
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:37,723
- Okay, talk to you later.
- What?

1220
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:40,017
Vincent Nichol
is not gonna testify.

1221
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,352
Why not?
I'm sorry.

1222
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:43,313
He's gone, he's gone.
Gone? He's in prison.

1223
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:45,564
Well, he ratted out
another cellmate

1224
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:46,983
in a capital case,

1225
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:49,568
and they put him
in witness protection.

1226
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:52,238
Where?
Uh, I don't know.

1227
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,781
They're not gonna tell me,

1228
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,616
and he's not gonna testify.

1229
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:58,828
- Do we even have a chance?
- Come on.

1230
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,664
Your Honour, this is
a habeas corpus hearing.

1231
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:03,345
We're not here to determine
whether or not

1232
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:05,960
the prisoner is innocent.

1233
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:08,129
We're asking if the prosecution

1234
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:10,381
so tainted this trial

1235
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:15,011
as to make the conviction
a denial of due process.

1236
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:17,554
That's Donnelly versus
DeChristoforo, 1974.

1237
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:20,391
John, I know why we're here.
Now, they used the testimony

1238
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:22,411
of a witness who sold themselves
to the prosecution.

1239
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:25,229
Your Honour... Now, the
State had the obligation...

1240
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:27,231
the obligation

1241
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,317
to tell the defence,
and they didn't.

1242
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:31,944
- You haven't proved that.
- Not enough.

1243
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:33,863
Not enough because
I have to convince you

1244
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:35,656
that's correct, that...

1245
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:38,575
tainted testimony
swayed the jury

1246
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:40,036
and determined the verdict.

1247
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:41,912
That's true, and I'm gonna
call a witness.

1248
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:46,167
Sally Linden was on
the original jury,

1249
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:49,295
but she was removed... Your Honour,
it's impermissible for a juror...

1250
01:15:49,337 --> 01:15:50,671
on the last day of the trial.

1251
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:53,174
To testify as to how
a verdict was reached.

1252
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:55,968
She was removed from the jury

1253
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,803
on the last day of the trial.

1254
01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:59,680
She was not involved
in the verdict.

1255
01:16:17,614 --> 01:16:20,701
Theresa, did you
shoot Bobby Gordon?

1256
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:24,121
I did not.

1257
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,834
<i>This was a long time ago.</i>

1258
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:30,920
You seem to remember it
so clearly.

1259
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:33,172
I took copious notes.

1260
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:36,133
They wanted us to think
that Vincent

1261
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:37,593
had absolutely nothing to gain

1262
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:39,345
by testifying, and we did.

1263
01:16:39,387 --> 01:16:42,181
- Your Honour.
- This is a big deal, Lynn.

1264
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:44,058
Don't interrupt again.

1265
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,102
So you're saying
the State's case

1266
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:48,229
rested solely on the testimony
of Vincent Nichol?

1267
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,022
Absolutely.

1268
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:52,608
It was his word against hers.

1269
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:54,318
We were led to believe him.

1270
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,612
You're asking
this court for remedy.

1271
01:16:56,653 --> 01:16:58,948
I have to be certain.

1272
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:03,327
Your Honour, we're asking that
the conviction be overturned.

1273
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,415
Wait, wait.

1274
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:10,501
Please, I just have to say this.

1275
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,755
Theresa Nichol was young.

1276
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:16,382
She was frightened.

1277
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:18,551
She did the wrong thing.

1278
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:22,221
We can sit here
and talk about why,

1279
01:17:22,263 --> 01:17:24,639
we can talk about
what she should've done...

1280
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,768
we can wonder
if there was one moment

1281
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,020
where she could've
changed everything.

1282
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,190
But in the end,
there's no undoing it.

1283
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:36,819
No one knows that
more than Theresa.

1284
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:38,737
She has paid the price for it.

1285
01:17:39,447 --> 01:17:43,493
But... Theresa didn't
shoot anyone.

1286
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:47,246
Justice wasn't served.

1287
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:49,624
We have a chance now,

1288
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:51,875
here today, to make that right.

1289
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:55,421
We have a chance
to do what's just.

1290
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:40,043
Sally.

1291
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,920
Hi, Danny.

1292
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:43,798
Uh...

1293
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:47,843
Do... do you want
to come inside?

1294
01:20:47,884 --> 01:20:50,095
Come on in.

1295
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:58,312
I'd, uh... offer you something
to drink,

1296
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,939
but I gave it up, so...

1297
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:03,567
Oh, that's okay.
I can't stay for long.

1298
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:04,901
Right.

1299
01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:07,780
Um, well, here, have a seat.

1300
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:12,743
So, uh, tell me, what...

1301
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,911
what brings you around here?

1302
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:19,166
Uh, well, they reopened
Theresa Nichol's case.

1303
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,795
The jury I was on.

1304
01:21:22,837 --> 01:21:24,839
Oh, right, right, yeah,
the, um...

1305
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,840
the murder trial.

1306
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,424
Yeah.

1307
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:30,469
I just thought I'd stop by,
see how you were.

1308
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:32,971
Yeah. Good, good.

1309
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:35,307
Terrific, actually.

1310
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:38,227
Got a bunch of deals
going out of Hong Kong now.

1311
01:21:38,268 --> 01:21:41,021
Um, just got money to burn,
those guys, I'm telling you.

1312
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:46,276
You talk to Aimee?

1313
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,696
Uh, yeah. She calls

1314
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:50,865
once in a while, yeah.

1315
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,366
She's doing great at school,
I guess.

1316
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:53,659
Mm-hmm.

1317
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:54,702
Yeah.

1318
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,081
Wow, you...

1319
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:01,417
You look great, Sally.

1320
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,168
You really do.

1321
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:05,087
Thank you.

1322
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:10,551
I... I just drove out
to Hanauma Bay, actually.

1323
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:12,511
To see where
the murder happened.

1324
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:15,972
You know, there's a legend
about that place.

1325
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:18,016
It's these...

1326
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,143
these two guys are fighting
over this girl.

1327
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:21,937
This beautiful girl.

1328
01:22:21,978 --> 01:22:24,732
And, uh, she wants them to stop.

1329
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:27,777
So she turns herself
into a crater.

1330
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:30,195
You know, sacrificing her life.

1331
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:32,489
And her father,

1332
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:36,368
he puts his arms around her
to protect her,

1333
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:40,664
and those are the arms
of Hanauma Bay.

1334
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:51,258
Sure was great to see you.

1335
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:54,470
You too.

1336
01:22:57,097 --> 01:22:59,892
Listen, Sally, I just feel
like I should, uh...

1337
01:22:59,934 --> 01:23:02,311
Don't, Danny.

1338
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,939
It was a long time ago.

1339
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:07,441
Goodbye.

1340
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:09,359

Dexter, Golden Retriever.

1373
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:03,891
You joined the dog program?

1374
01:25:03,933 --> 01:25:05,785
So far, he's not so hot
with the light switches,

1375
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:07,978
but we'll get there.

1376
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,980
But your verdict was overturned.

1377
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:11,690
They'll appeal.

1378
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:13,358
They could decide to retry me.

1379
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,945
It could take years.
They have to let you out.

1380
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:18,906
Eventually, but I can't
keep living in the meantime.

1381
01:25:18,948 --> 01:25:21,283
I have to live my life
the way it really is.

You too.

1383
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,537
You should finish your book.

But there's no ending.

1385
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:28,624
Well...

01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:30,793

01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:36,090
Yes.

01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:40,343
