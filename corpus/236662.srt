1
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,437
Tea for Two

2
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:12,645
Picture me upon your knee

3
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,648
Just tea for two
and two for tea

4
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:21,393
Just me for you
and you for me alone

5
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:25,426
Nobody near us
to see us or hear us

6
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,931
No friends or relations
on weekend vacations

7
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,695
We won't ever known, dear

8
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:35,464
That we own a telephone, dear

9
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,076
Day will break and I'll awake

10
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,305
And start to bake that
sugar cake

11
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:46,976
For you to take for
all the boys to see

12
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,689
We will raise a family

13
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,323
A boy for you, a girl for me

14
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,361
Oh, can't you see how happy

15
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,955
Oh, can't you see how happy

16
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:08,540
Oh, can't you see how happy
we would be?

17
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,270
Thank you

18
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:27,586
On January 161938 Carnegie
Hall was the home of one

19
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,560
of the famous jazz
concerts ever

20
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,961
Outside it was a cold night,
but inside

21
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,225
Well, that was another story

22
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,336
The music was blazing hot

23
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,631
Thanks to Benny Goodman's band
and his famous quartet

24
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,205
Who were joined on stage
for ajam session by Count Basie

25
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,110
And sidemen from Basie's
and Duke Ellington's Orchestras.

26
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,216
Ever since then almost every
important jazz musician

27
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,149
has graced
the stage of Carnegie

28
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,346
In no small measure that was
due to the fact that

29
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,649
the Carnegie Hall was
the New York home for

30
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,121
Norman Granz's Jazz
at the Philharmonic

31
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:05,526
Those landmark shows, which began
in Los Angles fifty years ago

32
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,293
Were the foundation of
Verve Records

33
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:12,370
In fact J. J. Johnson who played
trombone in our opening number s

34
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,530
was at the very first concert

35
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,507
Actually the lineups for
those Jazz at the Phil shows

36
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,305
Were virtual who's
who ofjazz history

37
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:24,007
So tonight we salute those
composers and players

38
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:29,052
Legendary masters who've made jazz
an uniquely American art form

39
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:32,089
You know way back in the 1950's
when I was a kid in school

40
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,216
studying classical music

41
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,488
There was one jazz artist
who showed me that to play jazz

42
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,963
You didn't have to abandon
your formal training

43
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,467
One player who whether he was
performing jazz or classical

44
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,902
could still blow everybody
outta the water

45
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,473
Of course,
I'm talking about Art Tatum

46
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,340
Very simply, Art Tatum
was one of the most incredible

47
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,146
instrumentalist
jazz has ever known

48
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,311
His technique was awesome

49
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:07,017
And his genius has intimidated
virtually every other jazz pianist

50
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,661
Including me

51
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:13,159
As Fats Waller once said
when he saw Art walk in to a club:

52
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,290
"God is in the house"

53
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,050
To play "Willow Weep for Me"
in tribute to Art Tatum

54
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,687
Here is one the most versatile
and accomplished players

55
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,455
in modern jazz history

56
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,387
Ajazz master
in his own right

57
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:43,086
This smooth and gifted musician
has been an important part

58
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:46,095
of the jazz scene
for five decades

59
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,167
Please welcome Hank Jones

60
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,297
Willow Weep for Me

61
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,629
You know I was just backstage
thinking what it means to me

62
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:08,922
to be here tonight

63
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:12,697
Singing with these great
musicians on stage at Carnegie Hall

64
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,599
My parents were both music
teachers are so proud

65
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,209
And Mr. Morosco
my high school orchestra leader

66
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,504
Well, if he could see me now

67
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,637
I sang "Tea for Two" with
high school orchestra and also

68
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,075
with a small swing
band back then

69
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,412
And one of my dreams is that
someday be in front of a big band

70
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,952
like the Count Basie Orchestra

71
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:36,522
Count Basie was born in New Jersey
and studied with Fats Waller

72
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,654
But it's sound springs
from the Kansas City blues

73
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,762
Basie's spare and precise
playing contrasted to

74
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,093
his band's locomotive power

75
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,932
And defined one of the most
distinctive and popular styles

76
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,199
in jazz history

77
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,503
After World War II when the
decline of the big bands began

78
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:54,305
Basie survived
by scaling down to an octet

79
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,109
But thanks to Norman Granz who
signed an account to Verve Records

80
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,686
Basie was be able to reform
his big orchestra

81
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,223
Some of his best later-day
moments came in collaboration

82
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,922
with singers like Frank Sinatra
and Ella Fitzgerald

83
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:17,035
Frank Foster's "Shiny Stockings"
was a hit in 1955

84
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,332
In '63, Quincy Jones
rearranged it for the now classic

85
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:25,068
"Ella & Basie" album with the
lyrics by all people Ella herself

86
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,476
Here with the J. J. Johnson
and the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band

87
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,515
Is a versatile performer
who started singing jazz with

88
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,141
the Thad Jones & Mel
Lewis Big Band

89
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,277
And has even earned
a Tony Award for her role

90
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,118
on the Broadway musical
The Wiz

91
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:44,024
with "Shiny Stockings" please
welcome Miss Dee Dee Bridgewater

92
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:48,163
Shiny Stockings

93
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:03,908
Those silk shiny stockings
that I wear when I'm with you

94
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:12,013
I wear cause you told me
that you dig that crazy hue

95
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:16,092
When we go to a dance

96
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:20,164
Do you think of romance?

97
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:29,138
Oh no, you take a glance
at those shiny stockings

98
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:36,271
Then came along some chick
with great big stockings, too

99
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:41,352
Then you change
your mind about me

100
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,354
Why I never knew

101
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,449
I guess I'll have to find

102
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:52,496
A new some other kind

103
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:59,230
The guy who digs my shiny
stockings, too

104
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,305
Shiny stockings

105
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:15,470
Shiny stockings

106
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:43,306
Then came along some chick
with great big stockings, too

107
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:48,105
And then you changed
your mind about me

108
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,375
Why I never knew

109
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:55,510
I guess I'll have to find

110
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,590
A new some other kind

111
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:06,195
A guy who digs
my shiny stockings now

112
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:13,369
He'll dig my shiny stockings
whoa and how

113
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:29,677
J. J. Johnson, Kenny Burrell

114
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,354
Thank you

115
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,722
Well as you just heard

116
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:40,465
To put the music across
ajazz singer needs a terrific song

117
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:44,432
Sometime even more importantly
she needs a wonderful arrangement

118
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,868
That's something that Ella
always had when she did

119
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,133
an incredible songbook series

120
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,141
Many of those records
feature brilliant arrangements

121
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:54,006
by the great Nelson Riddle

122
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,410
So I'm very happy to say
that this next song

123
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:02,145
Cole Porter's
"Just One of Those Things"

124
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:09,451
Just One of Those Things

125
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:17,334
As Dorothy Parker once said
to her boyfriend, "fare thee well"

126
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,666
As Columbus announced

127
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,941
When he knew he was bounced

128
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:29,013
"It was swell, Isabel, swell"

129
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:33,084
As Abelard said to Eloise

130
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:38,588
"Don't forget to drop
a line to me, please"

131
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:44,219
As Juliet cried
in her Romeo's ear

132
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:53,597
"Romeo, why can't you face
the fact, my dear"

133
00:17:55,274 --> 00:18:00,678
It was just
one of those things

134
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,879
Just one of those
crazy flings

135
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:08,384
One of those bells
that now and then rings

136
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,079
Just one of those things

137
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:15,683
It was just one of
those nights

138
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:18,929
Just one of those
fabulous flights

139
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,591
A trip to the moon
on gossamer wings

140
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,961
Just one of those things

141
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,005
If we'd thought a bit,
of the end of it

142
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,473
When we started
painting the town

143
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,978
We'd have been aware
that our love affair

144
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,346
Was too hot, not to cool down

145
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,581
Well good-bye, dear, and amen

146
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,516
Here's hoping
we meet now and then

147
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,353
It was great fun

148
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:52,088
But it was just
one of those things

149
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:01,394
Just one of those things

150
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,304
Just one of those crazy things

151
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:08,435
A trip to the moon
on gossamer wings

152
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,139
Just one of those things

153
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:15,515
Just one of those nights

154
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,554
Just one of those
fabulous flights

155
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,554
A trip to the moon
on gossamer wings

156
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,288
Just one of those things

157
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,695
If we'd thought a bit,
of the end of it

158
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,232
When we started
painting the town

159
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,602
We'd have been aware
that our love affair

160
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:39,105
Was too hot, not to cool down

161
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:43,510
So good-bye, dear, and amen

162
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,618
Here's hoping we meet
now and then

163
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,979
It was great fun

164
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:59,554
But it was just one of
those things

165
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:07,161
Thank you, thank you

166
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,476
In his early days

167
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:18,447
Bud Powell quickly earned
a reputation for his phenomenal technique

168
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,348
And he was often
compared to Art Tatum

169
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,546
One night Tatum went
to check out the competition

170
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,454
Before seeing Powell play

171
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,585
Tatum was heard to say:

172
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,230
"He is all right hand"

173
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,697
But Powell overheard that
remark and when he came out

174
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:40,437
He played the entire set with
his right hand behind his back

175
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,206
One of the great innovators
in the history ofjazz

176
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,317
Bud Powell was to the piano
what Charlie Parker was to the alto sax

177
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,012
A leader
who set the style for his generation

178
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,247
and many generations
of players

179
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:02,257
Powell was purist in the fast tempos
but no matter what the pace

180
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,921
Powell played with an
emotional fury and fire

181
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:09,465
He was the quintessential
bebop pianist

182
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,673
Here to pay tribute to
Bud Powell

183
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:25,177
Please welcome Japan's premier
jazz pianist Yosuke Yamashita

184
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,314
Parisian Thoroughfare

185
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:46,277
Almost fifty years ago Dizzy
Gillespie and Charlie Parker

186
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:50,980
led their pioneering bop quintet
at 52nd St's Downbeat Club

187
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,057
Just around the corner from
here where we are tonight

188
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:57,525
They tell the story of day
when a young Miles Davis said:

189
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:01,359
"Hey Dizzy, I can do everything
you can do on the trumpet"

190
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,266
And Dizzy replied:
"Yah, but an octave lower"

191
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,676
Dizzy Gillespie is one of
the real giants ofjazz

192
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,708
A founding father of bebop

193
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,017
His speed, high notes
harmonic sophistication

194
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,413
and technical brilliants

195
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:25,647
Even the shape of his horn
made him a one of a kind player

196
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:26,548
In the mid 40's

197
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:30,718
Dizzy and friends made history
as part of the legendary bop band

198
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:34,225
Formed by the great vocalist
Billy Eckstine

199
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,427
One of Dizzy's busiest
contributions was that he brought

200
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:07,430
the Afro-Cuban rhythms
of the Caribbean into jazz

201
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:11,434
His 1947 collaboration
with Chano Pozzo

202
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,470
a legendary Cuban Conga player

203
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:17,165
Is an exciting mix
of rhythm and horn cadenzas

204
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:22,337
Here are trumpet soloist Roy
Hargrove percussionist Don Alias

205
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:26,507
Steve Turre on shells and
the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band

206
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:31,145
In a salute to Dizzy's many
recordings of "Manteca"

207
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,282
Manteca

208
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,556
In the late 1950's

209
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:30,160
Bill Evans joined
the Miles Davis Quintet

210
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,458
Bringing with him an entirely new
harmonic approach to jazz piano

211
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,032
According to legend

212
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:40,035
On Bill's first night with
the band when Miles wasn't playing

213
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:46,076
He stood directly over the piano
studying what Bill Evans was doing

214
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,078
Now having come to jazz
through Bill Evans

215
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:53,651
I know why Miles was paying
such close attention

216
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,352
As did his idol Bud Powell

217
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,256
Bill Evans brought the harmonies
of the classical composers to jazz

218
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,124
Evans showed that
impressionism could swing

219
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:10,131
That cool could embrace
the warmth of romanticism

220
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,279
Right now, I'd like to pay
tribute to one of my idols

221
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:32,480
By performing his classic
"Turn Out the Stars"

222
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:36,424
To do that, I've asked an
old friend of mine to join me

223
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,554
He is John McLaughlin

224
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:01,108
Turn Out the Stars

225
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:39,923
In the 1960's the American public
seemed to turn away from jazz

226
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,548
But there were a few artists
who managed to break through

227
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,594
And one of the most successful
was the instantly recognizable

228
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,888
Signature guitar sound of
Wes Montgomery

229
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:04,072
He began by emulating his idol
Charlie Christian

230
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:07,048
But as the story goes
his original style wasn't really

231
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,015
influenced by anybody

232
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,020
Montgomery played with his
thumb instead of a pick

233
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,181
Because he didn't want to
disturb his neighbors

234
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,555
Or wake his sleeping children

235
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,496
Right now we are fortunate enough
to have one of the legendary

236
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,226
musicians from that period
with us tonight

237
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:01,064
With "Walk on the Wildside"
his biggest hit from the 60's

238
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:05,072
Here is a man who was a frequent
collaborator with Wes Montgomery

239
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,234
And a great innovator
in his own right

240
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:11,439
Please welcome the world's
greatest jazz organist, Jimmy Smith

241
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:21,147
Walk on the Wildside

242
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,661
Thank you very much
thank you, thank you

243
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,733
Long time ago

244
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,373
Wes Montgomery and I did a thing called
"Down by the Riverside"

245
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,307
And God bless his soul

246
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,108
We're gonna try to do it tonight
I have another friend of mine

247
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:40,944
Mr. Kenny Burrell, a great guitarist

248
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:44,384
And we are gonna do it for you
thank you

249
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:49,582
Down by the Riverside

250
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:30,116
Yellowstone

251
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:05,631
Here are
Herbie Hancock and John McLaughlin

252
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,699
with their homage to Miles Davis

253
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:13,999
It's About That Time
