1
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:22,822
Is it on?

2
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:25,458
Ok.

3
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:33,899
How does it look?

4
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:35,400
Looks good. Ready?

5
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:37,070
Yeah, yeah. Come.

6
00:00:37,668 --> 00:00:38,671
Take his...

7
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:45,878
All perfect praise be to Allah,
the lord of the worlds.

8
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,780
I testify that there is none
worthy of worship except Allah

9
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:50,883
and that Mohammed is his slave
and messenger.

10
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:52,650
We ask Allah to exalt
his mention,

11
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:55,555
as well as that of his family
and all his companions.

12
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:58,857
This is an ultimatum directed
to the American people

13
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:02,428
and the hypocritical
American administration

14
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:05,697
release all our brothers who you
keep prisoner in Guantanamo bay,

15
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:07,665
or these American soldiers

16
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:09,702
who served in Iraq
and Afghanistan

17
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:13,003
that killed our Muslim
brothers and sisters will die.

18
00:01:13,904 --> 00:01:15,973
Don't believe that the
white house is allowed

19
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:17,809
to implement its
aggressive policies

20
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:20,779
against the weak in Guantanamo
bay without consequence.

21
00:01:21,044 --> 00:01:22,847
Today is a wake-up call.

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,183
Don't believe that we won't
retaliate against the oppressor.

23
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:29,053
This message is directed to
the pretenders of freedom

24
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:31,789
at the white house
and the American people.

25
00:01:31,823 --> 00:01:33,657
We expect the white house
to release a statement

26
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,793
within twenty four hours,

27
00:01:35,827 --> 00:01:38,029
or we will kill one
of the soldiers.

28
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,132
Allah willing and nothing
is too great for Allah.

29
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:43,768
God is the greatest and
glory be to islam.

30
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:45,737
All praise is due to Allah.

31
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,182

-Yeah not bad.
-Not bad at all.

48
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:38,648
Ok.

49
00:03:40,783 --> 00:03:42,552
All right you're up brother.

50
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:47,525
Now here is a map of...

51
00:03:47,757 --> 00:03:49,225
Sunset mall.

52
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:54,265
You want to go here
to the garage.

53
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:56,967
There they have Wi-Fi.

54
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,770
User-name password
you have them?

55
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:01,805
Yeah.

56
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:03,273
Ok.

57
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:05,609
Keep your head down.

58
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:09,012
I understand.

59
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:13,684
May Allah be with you.

60
00:05:28,157 --> 00:05:29,626
So how did it go?

61
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:31,660
You mean with the videos?

62
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:32,828
Yes.

63
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,131
Good, good.

64
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:39,936
Shahin is emailing
the news stations as we speak.

65
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:43,938
Do you want some tea?

66
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:45,708
Yes that would be wonderful.

67
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:21,810
So...

68
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,845
How long have you lived here?

69
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:27,382
In America.

70
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:28,884
Yes.

71
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,187
It's about...
Six years now.

72
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:35,723
Really.

73
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:38,994
Have you always
lived in Florida?

74
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,729
No,
actually I used to live in...

75
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:43,899
San Francisco before
I came to Tampa.

76
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:47,034
I hear it's beautiful there.

77
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:49,904
Yes it is.

78
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:58,146
So you're from Chicago?

79
00:06:58,178 --> 00:06:59,180
Yes.

80
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:02,451
American citizenship.

81
00:07:03,117 --> 00:07:04,119
Yes.

82
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,056
Proper yankee girl

83
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,966
I'd love to go to Chicago.

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,935
Big Muslim population there.

85
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:23,904
Halal food.

86
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,341
Devon Avenue.

87
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:30,946
How did I know you were
going to say that?

88
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:21,928
I'm going to bring some tea to
Hamal.

89
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:53,193
I brought you some tea.

90
00:08:53,226 --> 00:08:55,462
-Let's go outside.
-I want to talk to you.

91
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:05,105
Why do you always take off
your scarf when you get home?

92
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:06,540
Because I'm home.

93
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:08,107
I don't like it.

94
00:09:08,141 --> 00:09:09,208
But I'm home.

95
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:10,544
You're here with two other men.

96
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:13,347
Yes, but I'm home.

97
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:16,282
Hey, I'm your brother.
I'm talking to you.

98
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:19,252
-Yes, I heard you.
-You're not my boss.

99
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:37,536
We have breaking news.

100
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:39,404
A video has just
been released

101
00:09:39,438 --> 00:09:41,908
from an unnamed
terrorist organization.

102
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:45,144
Two decorated soldiers who
served in Iraq and Afghanistan

103
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:46,712
have been kidnapped.

104
00:09:46,745 --> 00:09:50,549
The soldiers have now been identified
as Anthony Morales and Donald Young.

105
00:09:50,982 --> 00:09:52,919
In the following
experts of the video

106
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:54,452
the terrorists
demand the release

107
00:09:54,486 --> 00:09:57,122
of all prisoners at
Guantanamo bay detention center.

108
00:09:57,489 --> 00:10:01,160
If their demands are not met they
will execute one of the soldiers.

109
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,529
We're going now live
to Tampa, Florida

110
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,398
where the video was
supposedly emailed

111
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,332
to several news agencies.

112
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:09,669
This is completely
unprecedented.

113
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,039
Terrorists have kidnapped
soldiers on us soil.

114
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:16,675
This sort of thing usually
happens overseas in war zones.

115
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,178
Now the alert
is nationwide.

116
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,981
So if you see anything
suspicious out there

117
00:10:22,014 --> 00:10:24,649
please contact your
local law enforcement.

118
00:10:24,683 --> 00:10:27,452
We're still waiting for a statement
from the state department.

119
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:29,322
When that comes
we'll share that with you.

120
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,081
I'll take over.

121
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:57,116
Finally.

122
00:10:58,249 --> 00:10:59,384
Any problems.

123
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:01,420
Fine. No problems.

124
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:12,329
It is now confirmed
that a terrorist cell,

125
00:11:12,363 --> 00:11:15,066
operating in Tampa, Florida,
has kidnapped

126
00:11:15,099 --> 00:11:17,069
two United States
soldiers.

127
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:19,270
Anthony Morales and Donald
Young

128
00:11:19,302 --> 00:11:20,671
we made the news.

129
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:22,574
Who served in Iraq and Afghanistan
are currently being held hostage

130
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:27,044
we received a video showing
the terrorists' demands

131
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:29,981
to release all prisoners of
the Guantanamo bay prison.

132
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:32,750
The terrorists are threatening
to execute one of the soldiers

133
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:34,418
-if demands are not met.
-I'm going for a run.

134
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:37,154
I'll be back in thirty minutes. The
FBI along with local law enforcement

135
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:40,124
are working around the clock
to locate this terror cell.

136
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,192
And they are seeking the
public's help in this matter.

137
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:44,294
We're going live now
to Tampa, Florida,

138
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:46,597
from where the video was
apparently emailed.

139
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:13,557
Smells good.

140
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,427
This is very good Fahdah.

141
00:12:20,163 --> 00:12:24,135
I was just telling your sister
what a good cook she is Hamal.

142
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,110
It's good.
Very good.

143
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:38,649
So...

144
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:40,616
Have you ever been
to that restaurant.

145
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:41,751
On Devon Avenue.

146
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:42,787
Which one?

147
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:44,421
Uhm...

148
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,255
I can't think of...

149
00:12:46,288 --> 00:12:49,125
You know they're
known for putting

150
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:52,763
the extra bell peppers and
mushrooms in the samosa.

151
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:55,532
Yes, I know which one
you're thinking of.

152
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:56,633
I love that.

153
00:12:58,468 --> 00:12:59,469
So...

154
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:01,104
Have you ever been to Tariq's
Cafe,

155
00:13:01,138 --> 00:13:02,639
where they sell
the fresh jaleibi?

156
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:05,241
Tariq's Cafe.

157
00:13:05,274 --> 00:13:07,677
I love Tariq's Cafe. They're
world known for their jaleibi.

158
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:10,780
So.

159
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,449
What part...

160
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:13,717
Listen...

161
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:15,285
What?

162
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:16,553
What?

163
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:22,258
You were saying something.

164
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,828
I was thinking,
what are we going to do

165
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,263
if the administration doesn't

166
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:27,498
come out with an
official statement

167
00:13:27,531 --> 00:13:29,199
they're releasing the prisoners.

168
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:31,602
Then we send them a message.

169
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,638
So what part of
Chicago are you from?

170
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,474
You mean kill one of them.

171
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,310
You know we have our orders.

172
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:40,777
You understand.

173
00:13:41,577 --> 00:13:43,680
We have to do what
we have to do.

174
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:44,982
It's...

175
00:13:45,014 --> 00:13:46,649
It's probably not going to work.

176
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:55,392
Look. We are at war Hamal.

177
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:58,462
The west is waging war
against the Muslim people.

178
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:08,239
You're having fun?

179
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:13,709
What's the matter?
Cat cut your tongue?

180
00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:16,778
Doesn't feel too good does it.

181
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:18,915
Come on say something?

182
00:14:22,017 --> 00:14:25,220
I'm sure under different
circumstances who knows right?

183
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:28,223
We could have been friends
maybe? What do you think?

184
00:15:40,728 --> 00:15:41,497
Yes.

185
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:45,300
Proceed with the next stage.

186
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:45,867
Ok.

187
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:46,902
How is the house?

188
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:49,037
House? Good. Yeah.

189
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,772
Good, you have
everything you need?

190
00:15:50,805 --> 00:15:52,674
Yeah.

191
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:54,910
Report back in two days.

192
00:16:02,916 --> 00:16:04,919
We can't believe this is
happening.

193
00:16:07,889 --> 00:16:09,691
We just want him home with
us.

194
00:16:09,723 --> 00:16:12,927
Saying the United States does not
negotiate with terrorists and that...

195
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:15,931
I wish they just could let
him go and...

196
00:16:16,731 --> 00:16:18,299
trying to hurt his
father...

197
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,734
The us administration
released a statement today

198
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:23,839
regarding the kidnapping
of two decorated soldiers.

199
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:25,707
In this statement

200
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,443
the United States refuses to
negotiate with the terrorists,

201
00:16:28,476 --> 00:16:30,445
and will not release the
prisoners.

202
00:16:30,477 --> 00:16:32,647
This sparked an outcry
from the opposition.

203
00:16:48,362 --> 00:16:50,332
Hey, Fahdah.

204
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,001
Could you go...

205
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:54,068
Get Hamal.

206
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:56,371
And keep an eye
on the prisoners

207
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:20,996
they want you inside.

208
00:17:22,163 --> 00:17:23,565
I'll keep an eye on them.

209
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:38,644
Hamal.

210
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:39,846
What's going on?

211
00:17:40,713 --> 00:17:41,715
Sit down.

212
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:52,827
So...

213
00:17:54,728 --> 00:17:57,498
The administration
is not cooperating.

214
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:00,500
I knew it wasn't going to work.

215
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:01,534
Well...

216
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:05,172
It's time to show this country
who they're dealing with.

217
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:10,744
I spoke with Al-Saqri and he
wants us to go ahead with the...

218
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,779
Operation.

219
00:18:12,812 --> 00:18:14,647
So it's decided. Tomorrow.

220
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:15,750
We do it tomorrow.

221
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,684
So are we going to kill one
of them?

222
00:18:18,718 --> 00:18:20,421
Yes those are the orders.

223
00:18:21,922 --> 00:18:23,690
It's not going to work. What makes
you think it's going to work?

224
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:25,760
It's going to work trust me.

225
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:27,427
I can't do it.

226
00:18:28,828 --> 00:18:29,829
What?

227
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:32,665
I can't kill a man.

228
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,801
I won't be able to.

229
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,205
We haven't even decided,

230
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:40,540
who's going to do it.

231
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:42,676
Well I just can't.

232
00:18:43,742 --> 00:18:45,546
This is our fight brother.

233
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:47,847
You knew that from the
beginning.

234
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:51,085
No, I know, but I mean

235
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:52,952
it seems so bizarre.

236
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:54,821
-I never thought that...
-Think about...

237
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:55,923
All the muslims

238
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,592
killed by those two soldiers.

239
00:19:01,894 --> 00:19:03,096
I know but

240
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:04,764
before anything else

241
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:07,100
I'm telling you.
I can't kill a man

242
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:11,136
I don't know if you understand

243
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,172
what we're trying to do here.

244
00:19:14,073 --> 00:19:15,941
But an order, is an order.

245
00:19:16,642 --> 00:19:17,911
I'm going to take a shower.

246
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:21,913
Uhm...

247
00:19:21,947 --> 00:19:23,916
Maybe I should put a call in

248
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:25,618
to Mr. Al-Saqri and...

249
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:27,986
He can remind you
what you're doing here.

250
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:29,823
No, I understand.

251
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:31,990
I'm going to take a shower.

252
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,760
Aren't you supposed to be
guarding the prisoners?

253
00:19:39,097 --> 00:19:40,165
I'll watch them.

254
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,506
Is he going to be a problem?

255
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,008
I don't know.

256
00:19:50,709 --> 00:19:51,978
So who's going to do it?

257
00:19:57,782 --> 00:19:58,784
Ok, so...

258
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:00,787
This is how we're
going to do it.

259
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:05,892
We're going to draw names
from a bag.

260
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:10,163
Last name in the
bag has to do it.

261
00:20:10,962 --> 00:20:12,130
No going back.

262
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,503
Ok.

263
00:20:21,105 --> 00:20:22,107
Hamal.

264
00:20:24,143 --> 00:20:25,178
I don't know.

265
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:28,647
Look.

266
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:33,253
If my name is the one that's
last in the bag then I'll do it.

267
00:20:34,118 --> 00:20:36,788
But I'm not going to do it just
because you don't want to do it.

268
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,701
Ok.

269
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:25,237
Let's do this.

270
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,176
Ok, let's draw the first name.

271
00:21:37,949 --> 00:21:38,950
Shahin.

272
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:44,623
Go ahead.

273
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:55,300
What does it say?

274
00:21:57,969 --> 00:21:58,970
Asad.

275
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:07,311
Ok.

276
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:09,715
It's decided

277
00:22:13,418 --> 00:22:14,620
I can't do it.

278
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:27,997
Exactly like I told you.
You understand?

279
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,032
Yes.

280
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:33,737
All perfect praise be to Allah,

281
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,970
the lord of the worlds.

282
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:38,074
I testify that there is none
worthy of worship except Allah.

283
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,043
And that Mohammed is his slave
and messenger.

284
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:42,245
We ask Allah to exalt his
mention

285
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,181
as well as that of his family
and all his companions.

286
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:47,918
This is a message directed
to the American people

287
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:50,220
and the hypocritical
American administration.

288
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,955
We will hold to account those

289
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:55,191
who have killed our brother and
sisters.

290
00:22:55,225 --> 00:22:58,295
Just as you kill
our Muslim brothers and sisters,

291
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:00,431
so shall we kill yours.

292
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,299
Again release all our brothers

293
00:23:02,332 --> 00:23:05,069
who you keep prisoner
in Guantanamo bay

294
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:07,938
who you hold for years of
humiliation and disgrace

295
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,374
or I swear to God that every
American soldier is a target.

296
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:15,211
Every Muslim must rise
to defend his religion

297
00:23:15,245 --> 00:23:17,014
and his brother and sister.

298
00:23:17,046 --> 00:23:18,783
All praise is due to Allah.

299
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:17,272
Grab his arms.

300
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:05,521
Morning.

301
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:07,222
How are...

302
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:08,857
How are you?

303
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:09,892
Fine.

304
00:25:11,493 --> 00:25:12,595
Are you sure?

305
00:25:12,628 --> 00:25:13,897
No, I'm fine.

306
00:25:16,332 --> 00:25:18,467
How about I make you French
toast? Your favorite.

307
00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:19,501
Instead of that.

308
00:25:20,636 --> 00:25:22,038
I said I'm fine.

309
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:25,542
Stop trying to take care of me
all the time.

310
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:38,352
Hamal.

311
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:39,254
God is great.

312
00:25:39,286 --> 00:25:40,288
You did well.

313
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:41,889
Look at this.

314
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:42,924
I don't have time.

315
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:45,559
Who's watching the American?

316
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:46,594
You guard him.

317
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:49,030
Hamal.

318
00:25:49,997 --> 00:25:50,998
Hamal.

319
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:53,368
Where are you going?

320
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,474
All right.

321
00:26:02,243 --> 00:26:03,511
Here is a map of

322
00:26:03,543 --> 00:26:04,646
Redwood Mall.

323
00:26:04,678 --> 00:26:05,880
Ok, you know what to do.

324
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:10,478
We have to get rid of the body tonight.
We have to get rid of it tonight.

325
00:27:11,611 --> 00:27:13,547
Why don't we just keep the body
here?

326
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:18,252
Why don't we plop him on
the sofa. You know?

327
00:27:19,218 --> 00:27:21,988
Put his feet up.
We could give him a fruit drink.

328
00:27:22,688 --> 00:27:24,658
Better yet you could call
the police yourself.

329
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,526
And say hey we got a body...
You know.

330
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:32,165
The minute,

331
00:27:32,198 --> 00:27:35,035
the human body dies
it begins to decompose

332
00:27:35,668 --> 00:27:36,670
and smell.

333
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:40,507
We have to get rid of the body.

334
00:27:43,142 --> 00:27:44,644
I say we throw it in the bay.

335
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:48,549
Perfect. I like that.

336
00:27:50,117 --> 00:27:51,118
We'll do it tonight.

337
00:28:10,102 --> 00:28:12,172
I think he wants
to say something.

338
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:15,375
Get Asad.

339
00:28:32,626 --> 00:28:34,595
What seems to be the problem?

340
00:28:34,628 --> 00:28:35,662
He wants to say something.

341
00:28:42,802 --> 00:28:44,071
Take the tape off.

342
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,774
Take the tape off.

343
00:28:58,216 --> 00:28:59,451
You camel fuckers.

344
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:01,286
I'll fucking kill
every single one of you.

345
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,455
Put the tape back on.

346
00:29:02,487 --> 00:29:03,321
I'll cut you dicks off.

347
00:29:03,356 --> 00:29:04,323
Put the fucking tape back on.

348
00:29:04,357 --> 00:29:06,593
Every single one of you god
damn it.

349
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:31,517
I'm going to take a nap.

350
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,930
Hamal.

351
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:27,932
Come on. Let's go.

352
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:35,273
Come on.

353
00:31:45,716 --> 00:31:46,717
Let's go

354
00:32:07,704 --> 00:32:08,773
I'm very happy.

355
00:32:10,674 --> 00:32:11,642
Hey.

356
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:18,616
Ok.

357
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:20,218
Get some rest.

358
00:33:07,763 --> 00:33:08,564
Yes.

359
00:33:09,532 --> 00:33:11,468
Yeah we got rid
of the body yesterday.

360
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:13,037
Good good.

361
00:33:14,137 --> 00:33:16,307
Wait for the administration
to release a statement.

362
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:17,707
Listen one more thing.

363
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:21,012
Yeah. We're having
problems with Hamal.

364
00:33:23,446 --> 00:33:24,814
It's always something
with that kid.

365
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:26,483
What problems with Hamal?

366
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,354
I don't know the guy, he doesn't
listen to me you know he's...

367
00:33:30,654 --> 00:33:32,955
He just... doesn't listen to me.

368
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:36,027
And he's like under a lot
of stress. You know?

369
00:33:38,127 --> 00:33:39,329
He's under stress.

370
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,831
Stress yeah.

371
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:46,436
Call tomorrow. Bring him.
I'll talk to him.

372
00:34:21,737 --> 00:34:23,472
I'm not taking the tape off.

373
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:26,041
What. What do you want?

374
00:34:28,476 --> 00:34:30,579
If I take the tape off,
are you going to yell?

375
00:34:37,052 --> 00:34:38,054
What?

376
00:34:39,088 --> 00:34:40,490
Some water please.

377
00:35:04,179 --> 00:35:05,481
Thank you.

378
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,815
Thank you, you're the man.

379
00:35:10,853 --> 00:35:11,855
Wait. Wait. Wait.

380
00:35:12,855 --> 00:35:13,856
What is it?

381
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:15,959
Don't...
Don't put it on just yet.

382
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,161
Are you hungry?

383
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,712
Eat this.

384
00:35:53,227 --> 00:35:54,462
Why are you doing this?

385
00:36:01,035 --> 00:36:02,437
Are you going to kill me?

386
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:05,040
No.

387
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,575
-Don't lie to me.
-You killed the other guy.

388
00:36:10,778 --> 00:36:11,879
Let me ask you this.

389
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:14,915
How many of my brothers and sisters
did you kill in Iraq and Afghanistan?

390
00:36:14,948 --> 00:36:18,052
We wouldn't have gone to war if
you wouldn't have attacked first.

391
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,026
Did we really attack first?

392
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:55,957
So...
He wants to speak with you.

393
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,562
Why what did you tell him?

394
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:02,598
Nothing.

395
00:37:08,302 --> 00:37:11,838
I may have mentioned,
that you're under some stress.

396
00:37:12,905 --> 00:37:14,909
Why do you say that?
I'm not under stress.

397
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,778
It's obvious.

398
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:20,280
I'm not under stress.

399
00:37:20,313 --> 00:37:22,148
Don't speak for me.
You understand?

400
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:24,285
We're calling him tomorrow.

401
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,348
We have breaking news,

402
00:37:55,382 --> 00:37:57,717
regarding the ongoing
story of the kidnapping

403
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:00,054
of Anthony Morales
and Donald Young.

404
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,090
An execution video of
Anthony Morales was emailed

405
00:38:03,123 --> 00:38:05,325
to multiple news agencies
around the country.

406
00:38:05,925 --> 00:38:08,228
Its authenticity is still
being confirmed.

407
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,296
But we now believe,
based on the video,

408
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,864
that sergeant
Anthony Morales

409
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:14,367
was killed by the unnamed
terrorist organization,

410
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,771
demanding the release of all
prisoners of Guantanamo bay.

411
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,106
We believe that
sergeant Donald Young,

412
00:38:20,139 --> 00:38:22,175
their second victim,
is still alive.

413
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,177
We can only show you
an excerpt of the video

414
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:25,947
because of its
horrific nature.

415
00:39:15,094 --> 00:39:16,096
Yeah, it's me.

416
00:39:18,263 --> 00:39:19,732
Yeah, he's right here.

417
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:21,801
Ok

418
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:22,902
he wants to speak with you.

419
00:39:27,138 --> 00:39:28,274
What is the problem?

420
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:30,009
There's no problem.

421
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,279
Asad tell me you have
a lot of pressure.

422
00:39:35,346 --> 00:39:36,348
No pressure.

423
00:39:38,884 --> 00:39:40,387
You still have the nightmares?

424
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:43,023
No. No nightmares.

425
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:44,691
Good.

426
00:39:45,056 --> 00:39:46,892
Remember why we do this.

427
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,261
Remember what happened
to your parents.

428
00:39:49,294 --> 00:39:50,997
They were my good friends too.

429
00:39:51,362 --> 00:39:53,433
I took good care of you
and your sister yes?

430
00:39:54,734 --> 00:39:55,735
I know.

431
00:40:00,004 --> 00:40:01,240
Do you need anything?

432
00:40:02,774 --> 00:40:03,776
No, nothing.

433
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,446
How is your sister?

434
00:40:07,346 --> 00:40:08,348
She's good.

435
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,049
Good, good.

436
00:40:11,884 --> 00:40:14,187
When this is over
we go back to Syria.

437
00:40:17,455 --> 00:40:18,923
Put Asad back on.

438
00:40:19,423 --> 00:40:20,825
He wants to talk to you.

439
00:40:24,262 --> 00:40:25,264
Yeah it's me.

440
00:40:31,401 --> 00:40:32,704
Yeah.

441
00:40:34,338 --> 00:40:36,007
Listen to me very carefully.

442
00:40:36,374 --> 00:40:38,376
Hamal has issues.

443
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:40,778
I can tell I can hear
it in his voice.

444
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:42,780
He's getting very Shaky Asad.

445
00:40:42,814 --> 00:40:43,982
You have to support him.

446
00:40:44,014 --> 00:40:45,883
You have to give him
more confidence.

447
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:47,518
We need to be strong on this.

448
00:40:47,552 --> 00:40:49,954
Remember what happened
to the last adventure.

449
00:40:49,988 --> 00:40:51,490
Remember what happened then?

450
00:40:55,093 --> 00:40:57,129
Things have to be
more secure now.

451
00:40:57,162 --> 00:40:59,398
There is much more at stake.
Much more.

452
00:41:00,365 --> 00:41:01,500
Please.

453
00:41:01,532 --> 00:41:03,301
Treat him kindly Asad.

454
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:05,837
If he gives you any problem,

455
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:06,871
you call me again.

456
00:41:06,905 --> 00:41:08,039
I'll talk to him again.

457
00:41:08,072 --> 00:41:09,340
We have to build this kid up.

458
00:41:09,374 --> 00:41:10,308
You follow me?

459
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:16,046
Please.

460
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,282
We have to get
this operation going perfectly.

461
00:41:18,316 --> 00:41:21,218
The last operation
there were some weak links.

462
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:23,121
We can have not
any more weak links.

463
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:25,389
We are finished with that.
We are professionals.

464
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:28,192
So make sure
you take care of Hamal.

465
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,762
Ok?

466
00:41:30,928 --> 00:41:31,930
Ok.

467
00:41:33,497 --> 00:41:35,300
Look Asad.
You do it a good work.

468
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,435
And I'm happy with you
for the most part.

469
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:39,837
But once things start to fall
apart

470
00:41:39,871 --> 00:41:41,039
it goes into your lap.

471
00:41:41,439 --> 00:41:44,543
We need everybody
a hundred percent on this.

472
00:41:44,976 --> 00:41:46,311
This is too crucial.

473
00:41:46,577 --> 00:41:47,780
Ok?

474
00:41:49,113 --> 00:41:50,115
Ok.

475
00:42:00,857 --> 00:42:02,392
The water feels good.

476
00:42:08,931 --> 00:42:10,033
I like this house.

477
00:42:11,435 --> 00:42:13,137
I could see myself living here.

478
00:42:14,504 --> 00:42:16,206
But I miss Syria too much.

479
00:42:17,074 --> 00:42:18,909
Al-saqri must be renting it.

480
00:42:20,877 --> 00:42:24,347
Just to you know blend in
with the community.

481
00:42:27,484 --> 00:42:29,886
Residential neighborhood.
You know and all that.

482
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:33,424
No one would suspect anything.

483
00:42:34,324 --> 00:42:35,393
He's a good man.

484
00:42:36,592 --> 00:42:37,928
He's a very good man.

485
00:42:38,194 --> 00:42:39,362
I'm very indebted to him.

486
00:42:40,563 --> 00:42:43,900
He took care of me and my
brother after our parents died.

487
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:46,203
What happened with that?

488
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,843
It was 2003.

489
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:58,381
My parents, me and my brother
went to Bagdad to visit my aunt.

490
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,252
I remember it well.

491
00:43:02,618 --> 00:43:04,387
It was on a Thursday.

492
00:43:04,654 --> 00:43:05,956
March twentieth.

493
00:43:06,188 --> 00:43:07,859
There was an explosion.

494
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,362
Then more explosions.

495
00:43:13,663 --> 00:43:15,299
Coming closer and closer.

496
00:43:15,998 --> 00:43:17,167
Then a big boom.

497
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:20,071
I couldn't hear anything.

498
00:43:20,603 --> 00:43:21,906
My ears hurt.

499
00:43:22,438 --> 00:43:23,641
People screaming.

500
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,176
There was smoke everywhere.

501
00:43:26,609 --> 00:43:27,644
I got up.

502
00:43:28,377 --> 00:43:30,146
I went to my parent's room

503
00:43:34,115 --> 00:43:35,918
and it was half destroyed.

504
00:43:39,354 --> 00:43:40,923
And there was Hamal.

505
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:42,992
Standing there.

506
00:43:43,725 --> 00:43:44,961
Looking at them.

507
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,662
Dead.

508
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,102
My mother...

509
00:43:53,102 --> 00:43:54,104
Her legs...

510
00:43:56,238 --> 00:43:57,340
My father...

511
00:43:59,008 --> 00:44:00,010
Hey, it's ok.

512
00:44:00,475 --> 00:44:01,477
It's ok.

513
00:44:12,687 --> 00:44:14,490
I took care of him after that.

514
00:44:15,992 --> 00:44:16,993
Hamal.

515
00:44:19,361 --> 00:44:20,930
He was very vulnerable.

516
00:44:21,696 --> 00:44:22,865
He still is.

517
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:29,104
If my parent knew the American
government would attack,

518
00:44:29,305 --> 00:44:31,374
they wouldn't have gone to
Bagdad.

519
00:44:35,176 --> 00:44:37,379
Then we went back to Syria.

520
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:40,382
And Mr. Al-Saqri
got us visas to America.

521
00:44:41,316 --> 00:44:43,452
We stayed
with an uncle in Chicago.

522
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,589
Hamal would wake up
in the middle of the night...

523
00:44:48,524 --> 00:44:49,526
Screaming.

524
00:44:51,526 --> 00:44:53,062
Almost every night.

525
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,700
I would comfort him
until he sleeps.

526
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,303
I feel like I will always
take care of him.

527
00:45:06,142 --> 00:45:07,744
He's not strong like you.

528
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:46,781
Can you please pour some water
over my head?

529
00:46:04,565 --> 00:46:07,101
Come on man please
I'm fucking dying here.

530
00:46:32,293 --> 00:46:34,463
Man I really appreciate that.

531
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,173
You know I was wrong
about one thing.

532
00:46:45,873 --> 00:46:47,076
What's that?

533
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:49,577
About you attacking us first.

534
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:51,379
Really?

535
00:46:54,914 --> 00:46:56,617
I know the us government
has been messing around

536
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:58,752
with different parts of the
world for quite some time.

537
00:46:59,352 --> 00:47:00,354
But...

538
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:04,492
I was just doing my job.

539
00:47:06,727 --> 00:47:08,162
That's what I'm doing.

540
00:47:08,428 --> 00:47:09,430
My job.

541
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,133
Are you?

542
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,770
We're just trying
to free our brothers.

543
00:47:18,772 --> 00:47:21,342
Here try this.

544
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:33,720
I love mint tea.

545
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:35,356
It's good

546
00:47:37,624 --> 00:47:38,593
hey...

547
00:47:42,328 --> 00:47:44,731
You know they're never going to
free the prisoners in Guantanamo.

548
00:47:44,765 --> 00:47:45,566
They're not?

549
00:47:46,566 --> 00:47:48,668
The us doesn't negotiate
with terrorists.

550
00:47:48,935 --> 00:47:50,138
I don't know.

551
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,272
Depends on the public outcry.

552
00:47:52,705 --> 00:47:53,707
You want to bet?

553
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:58,578
Besides it's not like the people
being held there are angels.

554
00:47:59,245 --> 00:48:01,414
My older brother is
being held there

555
00:48:39,351 --> 00:48:40,353
what's wrong?

556
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:41,721
Nothing.

557
00:48:42,722 --> 00:48:43,823
You're not eating.

558
00:48:43,855 --> 00:48:44,656
I am.

559
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:48,794
And now you're playing
with your food.

560
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,538
He's being a cry baby.

561
00:48:59,572 --> 00:49:00,673
Shut up you hear me.

562
00:49:00,706 --> 00:49:01,974
Poor little Hamal.

563
00:49:03,442 --> 00:49:04,543
Asad stop.

564
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:05,877
I said shut up.

565
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:06,913
Hey.

566
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:08,514
Take it easy.

567
00:49:09,681 --> 00:49:11,550
Please don't get
worked up Hamal.

568
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:24,797
I have one thing to say to you.

569
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,802
Whether you like it or not,
this is a war.

570
00:49:33,907 --> 00:49:35,742
And what you did that
was part of that war.

571
00:49:50,588 --> 00:49:52,358
Who's the real terrorist here?

572
00:49:58,831 --> 00:50:00,500
And stop playing with your food.

573
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,744
He needs time.

574
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:15,381
He's starting to lose it.

575
00:50:43,975 --> 00:50:44,977
Who is there?

576
00:50:46,678 --> 00:50:47,680
Fuck.

577
00:50:50,482 --> 00:50:51,517
What are you doing?

578
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:53,718
Hamal.

579
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:56,322
Hamal go to sleep.

580
00:50:58,589 --> 00:50:59,792
Get some sleep.

581
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,995
You are crazy man.

582
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:15,707
Asad.

583
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:17,876
Yes.

584
00:51:18,142 --> 00:51:19,944
We have to talk about Hamal.

585
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:22,681
No, we don't.

586
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:24,650
Asad please.

587
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:26,751
Later I promise.

588
00:51:26,785 --> 00:51:27,618
I've been thinking...

589
00:51:27,653 --> 00:51:30,122
There is nothing to talk about.

590
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:31,957
He's a psycho.

591
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:40,031
Later ok I promise.

592
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:42,100
I have to go check on the
prisoner.

593
00:51:54,677 --> 00:51:56,012
How is it going in here?

594
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,650
Good.

595
00:52:00,516 --> 00:52:01,518
Good.

596
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:03,587
Ok, you can go.

597
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,626
Hey.

598
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:10,828
One second.

599
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,696
Could you freshen the tea pot
for me, please?

600
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:50,700
What are you doing up?

601
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,202
Nothing.

602
00:52:52,635 --> 00:52:53,637
Are you ok?

603
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,440
Fine.

604
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,675
Hey, can you guard the prisoner?

605
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:58,709
I'm kind of tired.

606
00:53:31,306 --> 00:53:32,709
Are you ok?

607
00:53:35,243 --> 00:53:36,245
Yes.

608
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,018
Are you sure?

609
00:53:42,051 --> 00:53:43,686
Of course she's all right.

610
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:44,821
Why wouldn't she be?

611
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,592
I don't know. I was just
thinking maybe...

612
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:49,792
Nothing.

613
00:53:50,091 --> 00:53:51,627
Did you see the news today?

614
00:53:51,993 --> 00:53:53,062
Yes I saw the news.

615
00:53:53,094 --> 00:53:54,830
You know the administration
released a statement,

616
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:56,699
saying they're not negotiating.

617
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:57,734
Yes I know.

618
00:53:58,134 --> 00:53:59,202
It was on television.

619
00:53:59,234 --> 00:54:00,669
I said I know.

620
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:03,640
It's just a standard statement.

621
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,575
Don't you think we should
rethink the operation and...

622
00:54:05,607 --> 00:54:07,209
Shut up, Hamal.

623
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,112
I'm so tired of your antics man.

624
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:10,847
Don't tell me to shut up.

625
00:54:11,346 --> 00:54:12,582
It wasn't going to work.

626
00:54:12,614 --> 00:54:14,850
I told you it wasn't going to
work and you wouldn't listen.

627
00:54:16,118 --> 00:54:17,888
Stop shouting like a donkey.

628
00:54:21,123 --> 00:54:23,126
Besides it doesn't matter
we're going on.

629
00:54:23,158 --> 00:54:24,626
Those are our orders.

630
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,161
Every day that goes by,

631
00:54:26,928 --> 00:54:29,097
there is more of a chance of
them finding out about us.

632
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:31,167
They have no idea who we are.

633
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:33,969
Ok, they have nothing
to connect us with nothing.

634
00:54:34,002 --> 00:54:35,738
I'm glad you're so certain, Asad.

635
00:54:36,772 --> 00:54:37,841
Excuse me are...

636
00:54:38,707 --> 00:54:39,942
Are you questioning me?

637
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,312
For your information if the agencies
have the slightest suspicion,

638
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:44,948
they'll come right
through this door.

639
00:54:45,948 --> 00:54:47,584
Make us disappear
just like that.

640
00:54:48,783 --> 00:54:49,651
No trial.

641
00:54:49,685 --> 00:54:50,253
No jury.

642
00:54:50,285 --> 00:54:51,253
No warrant, no nothing.

643
00:54:51,286 --> 00:54:53,756
We're going to end up in
Guantanamo ourselves.

644
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:55,525
Maybe I'm breaking
the news to you,

645
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:57,994
it's not like we have the right
to a free trial in this country.

646
00:54:58,027 --> 00:54:59,328
As if I didn't know that.

647
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,563
Yeah well

648
00:55:01,396 --> 00:55:02,698
just making sure.

649
00:55:11,305 --> 00:55:13,175
In the bay reeled in
the human remains

650
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:16,077
of what appears to be
sergeant Anthony Morales.

651
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,945
We're going now live
to Tampa, Florida.

652
00:55:17,979 --> 00:55:19,982
Btv here reporting
live at ballast point,

653
00:55:20,014 --> 00:55:22,650
where the police have
confirmed that the body found

654
00:55:22,684 --> 00:55:24,686
is that of sergeant
Anthony Morales.

655
00:55:24,718 --> 00:55:26,153
This is definitely
a tragic story

656
00:55:26,186 --> 00:55:28,689
and the coast guard
is here on scene

657
00:55:28,722 --> 00:55:30,659
and they're definitely
on high alert.

658
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:31,827
I'm here with
Roger Davis,

659
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,929
who's the man that discovered
the body while fishing.

660
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:36,097
Well I didn't know quite what
to... what to think at first.

661
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:39,900
I... I thought snagged my line
on a log out there or something.

662
00:55:39,934 --> 00:55:44,106
After that I reached my phone
and I dialed up the police.

663
00:55:44,139 --> 00:55:46,809
And kind of waited to
see... see their thoughts on it.

664
00:55:47,008 --> 00:55:48,776
So you didn't reel the body
in?

665
00:55:49,309 --> 00:55:51,246
No. No.
I didn't reel it in.

666
00:55:51,278 --> 00:55:52,581
I... I didn't know quite what
to do.

667
00:55:52,613 --> 00:55:55,282
I mean I didn't want to mess with
the crime scene or anything.

668
00:55:55,316 --> 00:55:57,185
I mean I watch TV
and I know how those...

669
00:55:57,218 --> 00:55:59,054
Those things work
a little bit.

670
00:55:59,086 --> 00:56:00,921
So you know I just wanted
to leave it to the cops

671
00:56:00,954 --> 00:56:02,256
see what they do.

672
00:56:02,289 --> 00:56:05,226
Right. Right. You did exactly the
right thing in this situation.

673
00:56:05,793 --> 00:56:07,328
Well there you have it I'm
Kelly...

674
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:14,369
What happened with your brother?

675
00:56:17,037 --> 00:56:19,240
He went to Pakistan after 911.

676
00:56:20,775 --> 00:56:22,943
We know he boarded the
plane back to the us,

677
00:56:22,976 --> 00:56:24,278
but when the plane landed

678
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:26,681
he didn't come out of the gate.

679
00:56:28,148 --> 00:56:29,249
That's crazy.

680
00:56:29,284 --> 00:56:30,751
We finally found out
he's in Guantanamo Bay,

681
00:56:30,784 --> 00:56:35,256
after three months of dealing with
those fuckers at homeland security.

682
00:56:35,289 --> 00:56:37,290
Classified as enemy combatants.

683
00:56:37,725 --> 00:56:39,192
No response, nothing.

684
00:56:42,895 --> 00:56:44,798
What did he do? Go to a
training camp or something?

685
00:56:44,832 --> 00:56:45,866
What are you talking about?

686
00:56:45,899 --> 00:56:47,034
He didn't do anything.

687
00:56:47,067 --> 00:56:48,402
He was visiting family.

688
00:56:48,435 --> 00:56:50,203
He probably did something.

689
00:56:50,237 --> 00:56:51,873
No, he didn't.

690
00:57:00,813 --> 00:57:02,216
So you're from Pakistan?

691
00:57:03,783 --> 00:57:06,453
My family is.
I was born here in the us.

692
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,058
Why did you join?

693
00:57:12,192 --> 00:57:13,226
You mean the army?

694
00:57:13,259 --> 00:57:14,261
Yeah.

695
00:57:16,864 --> 00:57:18,266
I needed a job and

696
00:57:18,464 --> 00:57:20,901
after 911 and high school

697
00:57:21,768 --> 00:57:23,071
it was the only thing.

698
00:57:25,071 --> 00:57:26,473
And you had to go to Iraq?

699
00:57:27,306 --> 00:57:28,308
Yes.

700
00:57:29,275 --> 00:57:30,478
-Where were you stationed?
-Bagdad?

701
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:35,349
Bagdad at first yes.

702
00:57:36,116 --> 00:57:38,786
Then we went to fallujah
in the anbar province

703
00:57:39,453 --> 00:57:41,755
and it was something
totally different.

704
00:57:42,255 --> 00:57:43,491
What do you mean different?

705
00:57:44,824 --> 00:57:46,861
Let's just say your people really
know how to hate each other.

706
00:57:47,928 --> 00:57:49,429
What do you know
about my people?

707
00:57:49,897 --> 00:57:52,299
I've seen my fair share
of what they're capable of.

708
00:57:52,498 --> 00:57:54,201
Sunni killing shiite.

709
00:57:54,234 --> 00:57:55,969
Shiite killing sunni.

710
00:57:58,172 --> 00:57:59,741
And you want to know
the funny part?

711
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,342
What's the funny part?

712
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:03,277
You call it the
religion of peace.

713
00:58:03,509 --> 00:58:05,812
And you're trying to
spread democracy right?

714
00:58:05,846 --> 00:58:07,947
Or your version of it by
the push of a button?

715
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,382
Please.

716
00:58:15,988 --> 00:58:16,990
Come here.

717
00:58:17,557 --> 00:58:18,759
What?

718
00:58:19,057 --> 00:58:20,260
I want to show you something.

719
00:58:22,028 --> 00:58:23,029
What is it?

720
00:58:25,597 --> 00:58:26,800
Back pocket.

721
00:58:40,912 --> 00:58:41,914
Open it.

722
00:58:45,117 --> 00:58:46,419
Inside there's a picture.

723
00:58:55,961 --> 00:58:56,963
Who's this?

724
00:58:57,329 --> 00:58:58,331
That's Jasmin.

725
00:58:58,898 --> 00:59:00,432
I'm trying to bring
her over here.

726
00:59:02,468 --> 00:59:03,570
Is she your wife?

727
00:59:04,303 --> 00:59:05,305
Fiancee.

728
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:07,340
Where did you meet her?

729
00:59:08,941 --> 00:59:12,345
I was stationed in the diyala province
on the east side of the tigris river.

730
00:59:13,479 --> 00:59:16,015
As part of an operation we had
to block enemy movement

731
00:59:16,048 --> 00:59:18,151
to Baghdad and to baqubah.

732
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:20,887
We had to clear the supply route

733
00:59:21,387 --> 00:59:24,057
for humanitarian relief
and food supply.

734
00:59:24,323 --> 00:59:27,160
She worked for the
humanitarian office in Bagdad.

735
00:59:30,195 --> 00:59:31,931
What did her family say?

736
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:34,099
She only has a sister.

737
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:37,137
Her brother in law caused
a few problems at first but

738
00:59:38,169 --> 00:59:40,874
I got him a job in the
Iraqi security forces.

739
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,182
She's beautiful.

740
00:59:50,349 --> 00:59:51,350
She is.

741
00:59:53,217 --> 00:59:54,420
I can't wait to be with her.

742
01:00:10,034 --> 01:00:11,569
I'm going for a short walk.

743
01:00:11,603 --> 01:00:12,638
Do you want to come?

744
01:00:17,107 --> 01:00:18,109
I don't know.

745
01:00:19,476 --> 01:00:22,348
I think we should keep
a low profile

746
01:00:23,514 --> 01:00:25,984
leave the house
as little as possible.

747
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:29,320
-Ok.
-But...

748
01:00:30,355 --> 01:00:32,257
I mean if you want
to go that's fine.

749
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:33,993
No. No, you're right.

750
01:00:38,163 --> 01:00:41,065
Would you like to have
a fruit drink with me?

751
01:00:45,136 --> 01:00:46,404
-Sure.
-Yeah?

752
01:00:48,105 --> 01:00:51,109
Sit down.
Have a seat.

753
01:00:51,141 --> 01:00:53,044
Relax I'll bring it to you.

754
01:00:54,411 --> 01:00:55,413
Ok?

755
01:02:06,316 --> 01:02:08,618
Like he had a frog
in his throat or something.

756
01:02:10,354 --> 01:02:12,490
But you know,
he's a good guy though.

757
01:02:36,847 --> 01:02:38,115
What are you doing?

758
01:02:39,783 --> 01:02:41,551
Hamal! Calm down.

759
01:02:41,584 --> 01:02:42,753
Don't tell me to calm down.

760
01:02:43,486 --> 01:02:44,521
What were you doing?

761
01:02:45,155 --> 01:02:46,156
Nothing.

762
01:02:46,457 --> 01:02:47,492
I don't know.

763
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:49,594
I asked you what you were doing.

764
01:02:51,461 --> 01:02:52,463
I don't know.

765
01:02:54,131 --> 01:02:55,133
Put a scarf on.

766
01:02:55,399 --> 01:02:56,401
Hamal.

767
01:02:58,202 --> 01:02:59,569
We were just watching TV.

768
01:02:59,602 --> 01:03:00,604
TV?

769
01:03:00,838 --> 01:03:02,707
Yes! TV.

770
01:03:03,606 --> 01:03:04,708
Hey, listen.

771
01:03:05,175 --> 01:03:07,377
You really smell bad you know.

772
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:11,047
Why don't you go do wudu?
It's almost time for asr. Ok?

773
01:03:12,248 --> 01:03:13,250
Hello?

774
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,685
Stay away from my sister.

775
01:03:17,219 --> 01:03:18,254
Just go.

776
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:35,270
Ok, you done?

777
01:03:36,505 --> 01:03:38,174
Come on, come on.
Pinch it. Let's go.

778
01:03:38,541 --> 01:03:39,643
Come on.

779
01:03:50,887 --> 01:03:52,255
Go put on the tape.

780
01:04:19,282 --> 01:04:20,784
Ok, go get the bucket.

781
01:05:05,694 --> 01:05:08,197
I was just wondering if you
wanted to hear a funny story?

782
01:05:10,298 --> 01:05:12,700
Hold on. Hold on. Just let me
breath for a couple of minutes.

783
01:05:21,977 --> 01:05:23,578
So how about that funny story?

784
01:05:25,513 --> 01:05:26,548
What?

785
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:27,615
Ok, so...

786
01:05:27,948 --> 01:05:29,250
Christmas a couple of years ago

787
01:05:29,283 --> 01:05:32,988
my entire unit was at fort benning
before our next deployment.

788
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:35,658
One day I was the first
to wake up.

789
01:05:35,957 --> 01:05:37,859
The other five guys
were still asleep.

790
01:05:38,526 --> 01:05:40,294
So this guy mccormick wakes up.

791
01:05:40,328 --> 01:05:42,698
And he tells me he's going
to fart in Rivera's face.

792
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:46,467
So he stand up and he lets out a
silent fart right in this face.

793
01:05:47,035 --> 01:05:49,538
We started laughing,
because he was about to wake up.

794
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:54,842
So then Rivera wakes up not knowing he
had a fart thrown inches from his face.

795
01:05:55,676 --> 01:05:58,713
He gets up and looks over at this
guy Winston who's still sleeping.

796
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:00,682
Then back at us and he smiles

797
01:06:00,714 --> 01:06:01,783
and he whispers.

798
01:06:02,885 --> 01:06:06,221
"Hey, guys. I'm going to
fart in Winston's face."

799
01:06:06,787 --> 01:06:08,356
So he gets up.

800
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:09,524
Walks over to Winston

801
01:06:09,557 --> 01:06:10,892
gets ready to throw
a fart in his face,

802
01:06:10,924 --> 01:06:12,327
when Winston rolls over.

803
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:13,560
Keep in mind still asleep

804
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:17,399
and throws one of the loudest
farts we have ever heard.

805
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:18,933
I mean we were dying laughing.

806
01:06:18,966 --> 01:06:21,236
It's a true story.
It's a true story.

807
01:06:22,803 --> 01:06:23,470
Hey.

808
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:25,573
What the fuck is
going on in here?

809
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:27,908
We're laughing over a joke.

810
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,776
So what we're doing here
is a joke to you?

811
01:06:29,809 --> 01:06:31,278
This is all a joke to you.

812
01:06:31,311 --> 01:06:32,746
Take it easy brother.

813
01:06:36,016 --> 01:06:38,253
This guy is our enemy
do you understand that?

814
01:06:38,918 --> 01:06:41,655
I need you to be a professional
and keep your mouth shut.

815
01:06:42,088 --> 01:06:42,956
And his.

816
01:06:45,425 --> 01:06:47,327
Go get some sleep.
I'll keep an eye on him.

817
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:47,862
What?

818
01:06:48,362 --> 01:06:49,364
Just go.

819
01:06:50,463 --> 01:06:51,465
Go.

820
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:33,807
Here is some breakfast.

821
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:48,956
Could you tell your... brother?

822
01:07:48,989 --> 01:07:51,559
It's his turn to
watch the prisoner.

823
01:07:51,592 --> 01:07:53,394
We have to talk about him.

824
01:07:55,161 --> 01:07:56,630
Ok, later.

825
01:07:57,798 --> 01:07:58,833
I'm worried.

826
01:07:59,967 --> 01:08:02,035
Ok, later.

827
01:08:15,448 --> 01:08:16,582
Yeah so...

828
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:19,986
I don't... I don't know what
to do about your brother.

829
01:08:22,621 --> 01:08:23,723
I mean...

830
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,429
He's got so many issues.

831
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:32,099
I know.

832
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,569
Just take it easy on him.

833
01:08:45,545 --> 01:08:46,947
You look stressed out.

834
01:09:04,796 --> 01:09:06,165
When this is all over,

835
01:09:07,966 --> 01:09:10,069
I like to travel
with you to Syria.

836
01:09:30,489 --> 01:09:32,125
Who's guarding the prisoner?

837
01:09:33,091 --> 01:09:34,993
Didn't I tell you to stay away
from my sister?

838
01:09:35,027 --> 01:09:36,663
Hamal, come on.

839
01:09:38,563 --> 01:09:39,564
You be quiet.

840
01:09:40,264 --> 01:09:41,767
And put a scarf on.

841
01:09:43,535 --> 01:09:44,737
You know what? Get up.

842
01:09:46,071 --> 01:09:47,807
Get up and go to your room.

843
01:09:48,272 --> 01:09:50,508
Get your hands off her.

844
01:09:50,909 --> 01:09:52,644
We weren't doing anything.

845
01:09:52,844 --> 01:09:54,747
Don't fucking touch her.

846
01:09:56,013 --> 01:09:57,648
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from her?

847
01:09:57,682 --> 01:09:58,751
It's ok, Asad.

848
01:09:59,784 --> 01:10:01,053
You need help Hamal.

849
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,889
I see you talk to her like that
again I'll rip your throat out.

850
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:08,827
I like to see you try.

851
01:10:13,031 --> 01:10:14,033
Psycho.

852
01:10:28,946 --> 01:10:30,214
What are you doing here?

853
01:10:30,247 --> 01:10:32,750
Listen. I want you to stop
what you're doing.

854
01:10:32,784 --> 01:10:34,286
Is this about me and Asad?

855
01:10:34,318 --> 01:10:35,521
What do you think?

856
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:37,622
There is nothing going on.

857
01:10:37,656 --> 01:10:39,191
Hamal is just taking it badly.

858
01:10:39,223 --> 01:10:40,758
All I'm saying is wait.

859
01:10:41,293 --> 01:10:43,128
He's on edge and
this is too much.

860
01:10:43,562 --> 01:10:44,563
Look at me.

861
01:10:48,133 --> 01:10:49,134
Ok.

862
01:11:04,081 --> 01:11:05,150
Yeah it's me.

863
01:11:07,318 --> 01:11:08,521
Finish it.

864
01:11:08,887 --> 01:11:10,789
Get rid of the other American.

865
01:11:11,121 --> 01:11:12,191
Do it tomorrow.

866
01:11:12,357 --> 01:11:13,692
Ok.

867
01:11:22,031 --> 01:11:23,767
The world is a screwed up place.

868
01:11:24,968 --> 01:11:27,605
I'm planning on staying away
from it as much as possible.

869
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:31,075
How are you going to do that?

870
01:11:34,177 --> 01:11:35,312
Build my own world.

871
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:38,181
What's your favorite
part of the world?

872
01:11:39,283 --> 01:11:40,084
I don't know.

873
01:11:40,116 --> 01:11:41,919
Come on man,
where would you live?

874
01:11:42,218 --> 01:11:43,221
Where would you?

875
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:45,656
I was going to move to Nebraska.

876
01:11:46,256 --> 01:11:47,691
I love Nebraska.

877
01:11:49,325 --> 01:11:51,661
Visited my uncle
before my deployment to Iraq.

878
01:11:51,695 --> 01:11:52,764
It's...

879
01:11:53,964 --> 01:11:56,066
It's a little cold
but you know it's peaceful.

880
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,636
Start my own business...

881
01:11:59,168 --> 01:12:00,170
House...

882
01:12:01,638 --> 01:12:02,839
Bring Jasmin over...

883
01:12:03,641 --> 01:12:04,642
Family...

884
01:12:04,941 --> 01:12:06,042
You know what I mean?

885
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:07,945
Don't tell me
you don't know what I mean?

886
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:17,088
What the fuck is going on here?

887
01:12:17,788 --> 01:12:18,790
Just chatting.

888
01:12:19,123 --> 01:12:20,124
Shut up.

889
01:12:21,057 --> 01:12:22,060
Shut up.

890
01:12:24,861 --> 01:12:26,096
What the fuck are you doing?

891
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:30,868
You think this guy
is your friend or something?

892
01:12:30,901 --> 01:12:32,370
No. No. I know.

893
01:12:33,236 --> 01:12:34,838
-You know what?
-You know what?

894
01:12:40,377 --> 01:12:42,179
Meeting in one hour.

895
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:55,759
Ok, so I spoke with Al-Saqri
and...

896
01:12:56,124 --> 01:12:58,060
We have to go on
with the operation.

897
01:12:58,927 --> 01:13:01,097
Did he say we have to kill
the other prisoner too?

898
01:13:01,931 --> 01:13:02,999
Yes.

899
01:13:03,032 --> 01:13:04,735
We have to finish the operation.

900
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:06,402
None of this is working.

901
01:13:06,435 --> 01:13:09,139
We have our orders
and we do it tomorrow.

902
01:13:10,972 --> 01:13:12,775
I don't think we should kill
him.

903
01:13:13,008 --> 01:13:14,011
What?

904
01:13:14,476 --> 01:13:15,912
He's engaged.

905
01:13:16,412 --> 01:13:17,047
So?

906
01:13:17,079 --> 01:13:18,314
To an Iraqi.

907
01:13:18,346 --> 01:13:19,983
He's trying to bring her over
here.

908
01:13:20,016 --> 01:13:22,285
I told you not to speak to that
prisoner.

909
01:13:22,318 --> 01:13:24,287
Didn't I tell you not to speak
to that prisoner?

910
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:25,322
He's a good guy.

911
01:13:26,389 --> 01:13:27,658
How do you know that?

912
01:13:29,124 --> 01:13:29,993
How do you know that?

913
01:13:31,327 --> 01:13:33,697
Do you know how many muslims
he's killed?

914
01:13:35,264 --> 01:13:36,265
No, you don't know that.

915
01:13:36,298 --> 01:13:38,734
I just don't think
it's the right thing to do.

916
01:13:38,967 --> 01:13:40,302
He's a soldier.

917
01:13:41,069 --> 01:13:42,972
And you are a soldier.

918
01:13:43,873 --> 01:13:45,142
Do you understand that?

919
01:13:45,975 --> 01:13:47,877
Do you understand that?

920
01:13:47,909 --> 01:13:48,912
Of course.

921
01:13:49,444 --> 01:13:50,447
Ok.

922
01:13:51,447 --> 01:13:52,949
So you do as you're told.

923
01:13:54,316 --> 01:13:57,053
-Besides what do you want to do?
-You want to set him free?

924
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:03,760
No, really, I mean
do you want to set him free?

925
01:14:03,959 --> 01:14:04,961
No.

926
01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:08,231
Orders are orders.

927
01:14:08,264 --> 01:14:09,798
You do as you're told.

928
01:14:09,832 --> 01:14:11,368
All right.
I heard you.

929
01:14:49,571 --> 01:14:50,773
Smells good.

930
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:13,228
That other guys,
is he in charge?

931
01:15:13,862 --> 01:15:14,864
Asad?

932
01:15:15,997 --> 01:15:17,500
He's my brother's best friend.

933
01:15:22,671 --> 01:15:25,040
Reminds me of my drill sergeant
at fort benning.

934
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,475
You shouldn't take
it personally.

935
01:15:37,452 --> 01:15:39,488
They're going to make you do it,
aren't they?

936
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:42,892
Kill me.

937
01:15:49,997 --> 01:15:51,199
Is this my last meal?

938
01:16:01,876 --> 01:16:03,379
Thank you.
It was good.

939
01:16:22,595 --> 01:16:24,299
Do you have a woman, Shahin?

940
01:16:24,531 --> 01:16:25,698
You don't shut up do you?

941
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,301
You're the only person
I can talk to around here.

942
01:16:28,335 --> 01:16:29,337
Women are trouble.

943
01:16:31,071 --> 01:16:32,140
Some women are.

944
01:16:32,606 --> 01:16:33,608
Not all but...

945
01:16:35,975 --> 01:16:37,378
Jasmin wasn't any trouble.

946
01:16:38,077 --> 01:16:39,112
No trouble at all.

947
01:16:40,214 --> 01:16:41,448
And her father was great.

948
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:45,318
I thought she didn't
have a family.

949
01:16:45,352 --> 01:16:46,354
Only her sister.

950
01:16:48,621 --> 01:16:49,957
Roadside bomb.

951
01:16:52,558 --> 01:16:54,862
I was on my way to baqubah
when I heard.

952
01:16:57,130 --> 01:16:58,966
I rushed to Bagdad but...

953
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:01,435
He had already passed
once I got to the hospital.

954
01:17:04,204 --> 01:17:05,406
Is she a good woman?

955
01:17:05,438 --> 01:17:06,941
She's a great woman.

956
01:17:09,242 --> 01:17:10,410
I love her Shahin.

957
01:17:13,447 --> 01:17:15,116
I'm thinking of her right now.

958
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:17,652
I want you to do something for
me Shahin.

959
01:17:17,684 --> 01:17:18,887
What?

960
01:17:19,085 --> 01:17:19,920
When they kill me.

961
01:17:19,954 --> 01:17:20,588
Don't think like that.

962
01:17:20,621 --> 01:17:22,189
They're going to kill me.

963
01:17:22,222 --> 01:17:23,023
They have to.

964
01:17:23,424 --> 01:17:25,393
I mean what else are they going
to do?

965
01:17:29,595 --> 01:17:31,098
You're a soldier Shahin.

966
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:33,800
I need you to let her know,

967
01:17:33,834 --> 01:17:36,437
that she's the only person I wanted
to spend the rest of my life with.

968
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,341
I want you to write to her.

969
01:17:43,309 --> 01:17:45,245
The email address
is in my wallet.

970
01:19:01,254 --> 01:19:02,356
Where is everyone?

971
01:19:02,754 --> 01:19:04,490
I don't know.
Inside?

972
01:19:30,614 --> 01:19:31,616
Fahdah.

973
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,022
Fahdah are you in there?

974
01:20:06,351 --> 01:20:08,454
Overnight the president
received updates

975
01:20:08,486 --> 01:20:10,721
from his assistant
for homeland security

976
01:20:10,754 --> 01:20:13,592
on the ongoing investigation
into these kidnappings

977
01:20:13,624 --> 01:20:15,359
in the Tampa Bay area.

978
01:20:15,392 --> 01:20:16,794
The president put out a
statement

979
01:20:16,828 --> 01:20:17,361
calling for unity

980
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:18,730
where were you?

981
01:20:18,763 --> 01:20:21,499
He said words cannot begin to
express our sorrow

982
01:20:21,533 --> 01:20:22,668
for the two families who are
grieving

983
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,436
were you in Fahdah's room?

984
01:20:24,735 --> 01:20:25,738
What?

985
01:20:26,805 --> 01:20:28,173
What were you doing in her room?

986
01:20:28,207 --> 01:20:30,776
This is a reminder that we live
in a dangerous world

987
01:20:30,808 --> 01:20:32,244
with threats from
those...

988
01:20:32,276 --> 01:20:33,511
We were talking.

989
01:20:34,279 --> 01:20:35,647
Why was the room locked?

990
01:20:38,749 --> 01:20:40,385
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from her?

991
01:20:40,418 --> 01:20:42,188
Hamal we were just talking.

992
01:20:42,419 --> 01:20:43,521
You disgust me.

993
01:20:45,457 --> 01:20:46,859
Hey! I'm talking to you.

994
01:20:49,793 --> 01:20:52,196
-Did you hear me?
-Don't touch me.

995
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:53,265
Hamal please.

996
01:20:53,297 --> 01:20:54,432
Fahdah stay out of this.

997
01:20:54,466 --> 01:20:55,767
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from my sister?

998
01:20:55,799 --> 01:20:58,337
I need you to back down now.

999
01:20:58,369 --> 01:20:59,704
I'm not backing away.

1000
01:21:00,204 --> 01:21:01,906
What is your problem

1001
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,575
your sister is a grown woman
in case you didn't realize that.

1002
01:21:04,608 --> 01:21:06,344
You're the lowest of the low
with no respect for anybody.

1003
01:21:06,377 --> 01:21:07,712
Don't fucking touch me.

1004
01:21:07,744 --> 01:21:09,346
You're lower than a dog.

1005
01:21:09,613 --> 01:21:11,749
And you are psycho.

1006
01:21:12,182 --> 01:21:13,685
You understand?

1007
01:21:13,717 --> 01:21:16,153
I don't know what happened to you in
Bagdad when your parents got killed,

1008
01:21:16,186 --> 01:21:18,155
but you got some serious issues.

1009
01:21:18,189 --> 01:21:19,257
How did...

1010
01:21:19,289 --> 01:21:21,259
Don't talk about my parents.
You don't know anything.

1011
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:22,293
Hamal stop.

1012
01:21:22,592 --> 01:21:24,128
Don't.

1013
01:21:24,795 --> 01:21:27,565
I said don't... fucking touch
me.

1014
01:21:40,711 --> 01:21:42,247
Asad.

1015
01:21:42,813 --> 01:21:44,282
Asad, no.

1016
01:21:44,314 --> 01:21:45,382
He shouldn't have hit me.

1017
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:46,417
No.

1018
01:21:46,449 --> 01:21:47,551
He shouldn't have hit me.

1019
01:21:47,585 --> 01:21:48,953
No, Asad.

1020
01:21:48,985 --> 01:21:51,256
Hang on, Habibi.

1021
01:21:51,588 --> 01:21:52,756
Hang on.

1022
01:22:02,466 --> 01:22:04,202
No. No. No, Asad.

1023
01:22:04,234 --> 01:22:05,435
No, Asad.

1024
01:22:05,469 --> 01:22:06,436
Stay with me.

1025
01:22:07,837 --> 01:22:08,905
No.

1026
01:22:08,939 --> 01:22:10,441
No, Asad.

1027
01:22:10,908 --> 01:22:12,610
No, Asad.

1028
01:22:13,877 --> 01:22:15,446
Say something.

1029
01:22:21,518 --> 01:22:23,354
Call 911.

1030
01:22:24,654 --> 01:22:25,756
Asad?

1031
01:22:25,989 --> 01:22:27,358
Asad?

1032
01:22:28,024 --> 01:22:29,293
No.

1033
01:22:56,551 --> 01:22:57,621
What happened?

1034
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,289
He shouldn't have hit me.

1035
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:03,292
So you stab him.

1036
01:23:03,826 --> 01:23:06,596
You take a knife
and you stab him.

1037
01:23:06,629 --> 01:23:08,898
If I do this are you
going to stab me too?

1038
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:11,667
Are you going to stab everyone?

1039
01:23:12,669 --> 01:23:13,870
It was self-defense.

1040
01:23:14,069 --> 01:23:17,974
How is stabbing him
in the back self-defense?

1041
01:23:18,006 --> 01:23:19,308
Tell me.

1042
01:23:19,341 --> 01:23:21,745
Tell me how it's self-defense?

1043
01:23:23,313 --> 01:23:24,913
You killed your own kind.

1044
01:23:24,947 --> 01:23:26,483
Do you understand that?

1045
01:23:35,491 --> 01:23:36,893
This is bullshit.

1046
01:23:37,393 --> 01:23:41,732
This is total and
complete bullshit.

1047
01:23:44,934 --> 01:23:46,270
Unbelievable.

1048
01:23:52,774 --> 01:23:54,710
We need to take this
to the bathroom.

1049
01:23:54,743 --> 01:23:56,647
And we need to clean this up.

1050
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:00,450
I'm going to get a sheet.

1051
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:47,790
Go fix that mess.

1052
01:25:48,456 --> 01:25:50,825
I'm going to clean up.
I'm in the garage.

1053
01:25:58,031 --> 01:26:00,435
We have to give him
a proper burial.

1054
01:26:01,534 --> 01:26:03,603
Islam says that we have to
bury him as soon as...

1055
01:26:03,637 --> 01:26:05,607
I know what islam says.

1056
01:26:09,709 --> 01:26:12,712
I mean what do you suggest we
do? Bury him in the backyard?

1057
01:26:12,745 --> 01:26:14,449
There is a pool back there.

1058
01:26:14,714 --> 01:26:16,150
I don't know.

1059
01:26:17,784 --> 01:26:18,786
I'm sorry.

1060
01:26:21,054 --> 01:26:22,088
We could...

1061
01:26:22,122 --> 01:26:23,525
Leave him at the mosque.

1062
01:26:25,159 --> 01:26:26,393
You really are an idiot.

1063
01:26:27,093 --> 01:26:30,163
I mean ok what do we do
when we leave him at the mosque?

1064
01:26:30,196 --> 01:26:33,868
With cameras everywhere the cops
will be at our doors within hours.

1065
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:35,904
You know what just go clean up.

1066
01:26:40,673 --> 01:26:42,176
We have to do something.

1067
01:26:42,209 --> 01:26:44,078
We can't just leave him here.

1068
01:26:46,579 --> 01:26:48,716
We have to bury him
in the forest somewhere.

1069
01:26:50,217 --> 01:26:51,919
We'll wash him properly.

1070
01:26:51,951 --> 01:26:54,021
We'll wrap him in
clean white sheets.

1071
01:26:54,588 --> 01:26:55,723
We'll pray over him.

1072
01:26:55,756 --> 01:26:56,790
And we'll bury him.

1073
01:26:58,025 --> 01:26:59,460
We'll do it tomorrow.

1074
01:27:32,692 --> 01:27:34,094
I thought I saw something.

1075
01:27:51,743 --> 01:27:52,811
I thought I saw something.

1076
01:27:52,845 --> 01:27:54,581
I thought I saw
some movement too.

1077
01:27:58,984 --> 01:27:59,986
I guess not.

1078
01:28:01,253 --> 01:28:02,256
Well.

1079
01:28:09,662 --> 01:28:10,664
Hello?

1080
01:28:18,203 --> 01:28:20,907
Hi I'm officer Kenneth
this is officer Cooper.

1081
01:28:21,207 --> 01:28:24,177
We received notice of a disturbance
coming from this house.

1082
01:28:24,209 --> 01:28:25,345
A disturbance?

1083
01:28:25,377 --> 01:28:26,579
Yes.

1084
01:28:26,913 --> 01:28:28,148
There is no disturbance here.

1085
01:28:30,016 --> 01:28:31,018
Can we come in?

1086
01:28:52,337 --> 01:28:53,606
What's your name, sir?

1087
01:28:54,007 --> 01:28:55,008
Hamal.

1088
01:28:56,275 --> 01:28:57,277
May I?

1089
01:28:57,743 --> 01:28:58,744
Sure.

1090
01:29:11,324 --> 01:29:13,693
Would you know where the
disturbance actually came from?

1091
01:29:14,725 --> 01:29:15,960
No, I would not. I...

1092
01:29:15,993 --> 01:29:17,263
I didn't hear anything.

1093
01:29:17,996 --> 01:29:19,699
And the others living here?

1094
01:29:19,997 --> 01:29:21,000
What about them?

1095
01:29:21,332 --> 01:29:22,601
Did they hear something?

1096
01:29:22,833 --> 01:29:24,069
No, not that I know of.

1097
01:29:27,205 --> 01:29:30,842
Have you heard anything or seen
anything suspicious around here

1098
01:29:31,108 --> 01:29:32,877
in the last couple of hours?

1099
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:35,214
No, nothing. Sorry.

1100
01:29:40,952 --> 01:29:41,988
Anyone else home?

1101
01:29:43,055 --> 01:29:45,992
Only my sister she's
sleeping in... in her room.

1102
01:29:47,992 --> 01:29:48,995
Can you get her?

1103
01:29:49,927 --> 01:29:51,296
You want me to wake her up?

1104
01:29:51,328 --> 01:29:52,331
We won't be long.

1105
01:30:07,011 --> 01:30:08,014
Fahdah.

1106
01:30:13,818 --> 01:30:14,853
Fahdah.

1107
01:30:17,889 --> 01:30:19,058
What do you want psycho?

1108
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:20,392
Take it easy.

1109
01:30:21,358 --> 01:30:22,360
The cops are here.

1110
01:30:22,394 --> 01:30:23,796
They want to talk to you.

1111
01:30:44,248 --> 01:30:45,251
Please.

1112
01:30:52,923 --> 01:30:54,091
Are you ok ma'am?

1113
01:30:55,024 --> 01:30:56,027
I'm fine.

1114
01:30:56,494 --> 01:30:57,762
Are you sure?

1115
01:30:58,262 --> 01:31:00,831
Yes, just a little tired.

1116
01:31:01,799 --> 01:31:03,702
Why did you call your
brother a psycho?

1117
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:09,874
We had a little fight.

1118
01:31:11,174 --> 01:31:12,176
What about?

1119
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:14,713
Excuse me?

1120
01:31:14,978 --> 01:31:16,414
What was the fight about?

1121
01:31:18,148 --> 01:31:19,149
Just...

1122
01:31:20,017 --> 01:31:21,318
Nothing really.

1123
01:31:22,253 --> 01:31:23,722
Trivial? Household?

1124
01:31:27,558 --> 01:31:28,926
Ok, well...

1125
01:31:31,094 --> 01:31:32,362
We received a call

1126
01:31:32,929 --> 01:31:35,133
of a disturbance
coming from this home.

1127
01:31:36,834 --> 01:31:37,969
A disturbance?

1128
01:31:38,001 --> 01:31:39,003
Yes?

1129
01:31:41,304 --> 01:31:44,142
Could it have been the fight
between you and your brother?

1130
01:31:45,209 --> 01:31:46,277
Fight?

1131
01:31:46,309 --> 01:31:47,312
Yes.

1132
01:31:48,813 --> 01:31:51,950
Yes. Yes. I... I mean...

1133
01:31:52,415 --> 01:31:53,950
I might have raised
my voice a bit,

1134
01:31:53,983 --> 01:31:56,387
but I don't think people outside
could have heard.

1135
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:57,856
Well maybe they did.

1136
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:01,358
Did you hear anything
before the fight?

1137
01:32:02,893 --> 01:32:03,961
No.

1138
01:32:03,994 --> 01:32:04,996
Nothing.

1139
01:32:05,595 --> 01:32:06,930
What about after?

1140
01:32:07,464 --> 01:32:08,966
No, nothing.

1141
01:32:13,469 --> 01:32:15,839
Well you call me
if you hear something.

1142
01:32:17,473 --> 01:32:18,509
Yes officer.

1143
01:32:21,978 --> 01:32:22,981
Definitely.

1144
01:32:23,447 --> 01:32:24,816
Can I take a look around?

1145
01:32:26,049 --> 01:32:27,050
Yeah sure.

1146
01:32:46,002 --> 01:32:47,236
So this is the office?

1147
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:01,317
I thought you said
no one else was home?

1148
01:33:01,651 --> 01:33:03,587
This is my other roommate
he's...

1149
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:05,155
Just went out for a walk.

1150
01:33:06,356 --> 01:33:07,491
Went out for a walk.

1151
01:33:08,624 --> 01:33:10,192
And what's your name sir?

1152
01:33:10,226 --> 01:33:11,228
Shahin.

1153
01:33:12,629 --> 01:33:13,831
Shahin.

1154
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,933
I'm officer Kenneth.
This is officer Cooper.

1155
01:33:16,965 --> 01:33:19,902
We're here because of a
disturbance call we got.

1156
01:33:20,937 --> 01:33:23,173
I don't know anything
about a disturbance.

1157
01:33:24,072 --> 01:33:25,374
How long have you been gone?

1158
01:33:26,642 --> 01:33:28,110
Just about an hour.

1159
01:33:28,544 --> 01:33:29,947
And where did you go?

1160
01:33:30,213 --> 01:33:31,882
For a walk just down the street.

1161
01:33:32,949 --> 01:33:33,951
Ok.

1162
01:33:35,517 --> 01:33:38,187
Is there anyone
else living here?

1163
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:39,155
No.

1164
01:33:39,722 --> 01:33:40,857
Just the three of us.

1165
01:33:42,959 --> 01:33:43,627
Ok.

1166
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:45,295
And the bedrooms are this way?

1167
01:33:46,295 --> 01:33:47,297
Yeah.

1168
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:48,532
Ok.

1169
01:34:24,266 --> 01:34:25,268
Well

1170
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:26,903
that's it then.

1171
01:34:31,105 --> 01:34:32,140
What's that?

1172
01:34:32,341 --> 01:34:34,010
It's a verse from the quran.

1173
01:34:36,311 --> 01:34:37,313
What's it mean?

1174
01:34:38,245 --> 01:34:39,248
It says...

1175
01:34:39,647 --> 01:34:41,617
He's Allah the one and only.

1176
01:34:46,087 --> 01:34:47,122
Tell you what.

1177
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:50,126
Here's my card.

1178
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,961
You hear anything,

1179
01:34:51,994 --> 01:34:53,195
you give me a call

1180
01:34:53,227 --> 01:34:54,262
of course officer.

1181
01:34:55,297 --> 01:34:56,299
Ma'am?

1182
01:34:57,031 --> 01:34:58,066
You sure you ok?

1183
01:34:59,501 --> 01:35:01,270
Yes. Yes I'm fine.

1184
01:35:02,704 --> 01:35:04,640
Excellent you guys have
a good evening.

1185
01:36:53,213 --> 01:36:55,350
I think somebody was following
me when I was running.

1186
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:58,685
Don't be ridiculous.

1187
01:36:59,353 --> 01:37:00,587
You're being paranoid.

1188
01:37:03,524 --> 01:37:04,526
I don't know.

1189
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:08,596
You know what I think.

1190
01:37:09,563 --> 01:37:11,800
I think it's time
to end this operation.

1191
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:27,279
What are we going
to tell Mr. Al-Saqri?

1192
01:37:27,313 --> 01:37:29,516
Look. I've made up my mind.

1193
01:37:30,849 --> 01:37:32,518
This operation is off.

1194
01:37:32,551 --> 01:37:34,188
It's final I'm done.

1195
01:37:34,853 --> 01:37:36,155
Think about it.

1196
01:37:36,656 --> 01:37:37,658
No.

1197
01:37:40,126 --> 01:37:40,893
Come on Shahin
what else are we supposed to do?

1198
01:37:40,926 --> 01:37:42,295
I said no.

1199
01:37:43,862 --> 01:37:44,865
Fahdah?

1200
01:37:46,698 --> 01:37:48,301
Leave me out of this.

1201
01:37:49,402 --> 01:37:50,871
This operation is over.

1202
01:37:53,372 --> 01:37:55,774
We have to talk to Mr. Al-Saqri.

1203
01:37:55,808 --> 01:37:58,545
And what do you suppose
we tell Mr. Al-Saqri?

1204
01:37:58,577 --> 01:38:01,281
About Asad and the fact
that you killed him.

1205
01:38:02,648 --> 01:38:04,117
Collateral damage.

1206
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,752
How is that collateral damage?

1207
01:38:09,322 --> 01:38:10,324
This is a war.

1208
01:38:10,822 --> 01:38:12,358
You're losing your mind.

1209
01:38:14,693 --> 01:38:16,395
I'm going to my room.

1210
01:38:21,201 --> 01:38:24,203
I'm going to get some sleep.
Why don't you guard him?

1211
01:39:46,817 --> 01:39:49,420
-Get up on the ground.
-On the floor.

1212
01:39:49,454 --> 01:39:51,690
-Get on the ground mother fucker.
-Get on the ground.

1213
01:39:51,723 --> 01:39:53,459
-Shut the fuck up.
-On the ground.

1214
01:39:53,491 --> 01:39:55,460
Shut the fuck up on the ground.

1215
01:39:55,494 --> 01:39:57,496
On the ground.
Shut the fuck up.

1216
01:39:58,629 --> 01:40:01,032
-Get on the ground now.
-Get up and get on the ground.

1217
01:40:01,066 --> 01:40:03,635
Get up and get on the ground
now.

1218
01:40:03,669 --> 01:40:05,903
Shut up and get up on the
ground.

1219
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:08,374
Shut up.

1220
01:40:08,406 --> 01:40:09,874
-Clear.
-Shut the fuck up.

1221
01:40:11,977 --> 01:40:13,746
-Get on the ground.
-Get on the floor.

1222
01:40:21,553 --> 01:40:23,489
Sergeant Young?
Sergeant Donald Young?

1223
01:40:23,522 --> 01:40:25,258
We're here to
take you home, sir.

1224
01:40:33,331 --> 01:40:35,668
Thank you.
Thank you.

1225
01:40:56,954 --> 01:40:58,390
Hi how are you?

1226
01:40:58,856 --> 01:41:00,025
I'm fine.

1227
01:41:01,025 --> 01:41:02,027
Ok.

1228
01:41:02,726 --> 01:41:04,394
Here's your statement.

1229
01:41:04,427 --> 01:41:06,430
Now I need you to read
over this carefully.

1230
01:41:06,463 --> 01:41:08,832
And then sign it at the bottom
when you're ready. Ok?

1231
01:41:12,469 --> 01:41:14,539
Well my colleague will
be in with you shortly.

1232
01:41:14,571 --> 01:41:16,740
He wants to talk to you
regarding your cooperation

1233
01:41:16,774 --> 01:41:19,311
in the capture of Mr. Al-Saqri.

1234
01:41:20,076 --> 01:41:22,414
I'll be right outside
if you need me. Ok?

1235
01:41:35,793 --> 01:41:37,027
This is Al-Saqri.

1236
01:41:37,594 --> 01:41:38,997
My men are in place.

1237
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:41,966
Launch operation capitol.

1238
01:41:42,633 --> 01:41:43,802
What about the girl?

1239
01:41:44,502 --> 01:41:46,071
I'll take care of the girl.

1240
01:41:46,904 --> 01:41:48,638
She won't leave
the building alive.

1241
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,741
Good. Good.

1242
01:41:58,848 --> 01:41:59,851
Get up.

1243
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:07,792
Mr. askani. You're being transported
to Guantanamo bay Cuba,

1244
01:42:07,825 --> 01:42:09,660
where you will be held
as an enemy combatant

1245
01:42:09,692 --> 01:42:12,030
of the United States
until further notice.

1246
01:42:13,164 --> 01:42:14,366
Stand up.

1247
01:42:16,466 --> 01:42:17,468
Stand up.

1248
01:42:27,877 --> 01:42:29,380
You got to see this.

1249
01:42:30,046 --> 01:42:31,815
No. No. No right
now I'm serious.

1250
01:42:31,847 --> 01:42:33,417
Ok. Can you watch him?

1251
01:42:42,059 --> 01:42:45,895
First reports are coming in of an
attack on the United States capitol.

1252
01:42:45,929 --> 01:42:48,431
At least ten people have
been taken to the hospital

1253
01:42:48,465 --> 01:42:50,434
including several
congressmen.

1254
01:42:50,466 --> 01:42:53,135
No one has claimed
responsibility for the attack,

1255
01:42:53,168 --> 01:42:55,738
but this comes on the heels
of the terrorist kidnapping

1256
01:42:55,771 --> 01:42:59,876
of the two us soldiers who
served in Iraq and Afghanistan.

1257
01:42:59,908 --> 01:43:02,112
Sergeant Donald Young,
one of the soldiers,

1258
01:43:02,145 --> 01:43:04,214
was rescued last night
from a terror cell

1259
01:43:04,247 --> 01:43:05,916
operating in Tampa, Florida.
