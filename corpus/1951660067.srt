1
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,986
Give up. Give up, I said.

2
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,990
Get out of my face.

3
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,693
Move it. Move it.

4
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,466
Fuck you up!

5
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,802
Break it up!

6
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,324
Come on, back off.
Take your hands off me.

7
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,672
Take this, take this!

8
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,064
Tell me, Twitch.

9
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,095
-Who started this?
-My name's Twitch...

10
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,833
...and I ain't no snitch.
I don't know nothing, man.

11
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,171
You're worried?

12
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,542
About them?

13
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,212
What they could do to you?

14
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,145
You should worry more about me.

15
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:45,017
-And what I'm gonna do to you.
-Look, man, I'm just working.

16
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,090
Just doing my time.

17
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,420
Just doing my time.

18
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,498
Model citizen.

19
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,301
See, Twitch has been here
a long time...

20
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,664
...seen lot of shit go down.

21
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,069
Like inmates trying to take over.

22
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,939
But I slapped them down
like little bitches.

23
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,240
Nobody wins in my island...

24
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,747
...but me.

25
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,217
What do you think, homeys?

26
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,790
Should I put any of you in the hole?

27
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,825
Shit.

28
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,862
Lot of guys like you in the hole...

29
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,659
...guys who think they're tough...

30
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,903
...guys who are beginning
to believe...

31
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,734
...they're bigger...

32
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,137
...than my island.

33
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,347
You bay beauties...

34
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,988
...you don't know
how fucking good you got it.

35
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,656
Hey...

36
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,553
...bag of bones.

37
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:57,663
You wouldn't last two weeks
in a place like Creighton.

38
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,661
-Toughest max-security joint...
-Creigh--?

39
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,800
...in the country.

40
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,632
In case you never heard of it.

41
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,869
It's where society took a shit.

42
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,475
And built a 40-foot wall around it.

43
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:15,341
And any of you could end up there...

44
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:18,540
...with a snap of my fingers.

45
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,249
So...

46
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,389
...everybody's on notice.

47
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,388
Whoever starts the next fight...

48
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:33,063
...gets a free ride, no questions asked,
to Creighton.

49
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:38,966
Then you can see
how bad you really are.

50
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,531
Now, get them back to their cages.

51
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:45,006
They're starting to give me
indigestion.

52
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,448
Come on, line it up and let's move.

53
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,117
Lock your chains. Let's go.

54
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,290
-That means you too.
-Back it up.

55
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,516
Creighton, huh?
That's in Missouri, ain't it?

56
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,268
Hey, Twitch.

57
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,708
Heard you got deep-sixed
at your parole hearing.

58
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,905
Looks like you're not getting out
anytime soon.

59
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:26,415
Oh, fuck you, Hubert.

60
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,952
I'm out in a month.
Mark it on your calendar.

61
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,624
While you rot in here, I get the gold.

62
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,952
Yeah, I'll be out a lot sooner
than you think.

63
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,755
Oh, yeah? You gonna dog paddle
off this rock?

64
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:42,060
-Oh, I got ways.
-A month, Twitch. That's what I got.

65
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:45,237
Yeah? And I got a nice,
stern ass-whupping for you...

66
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,236
...if you don't leave me
the fuck alone.

67
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,139
You.

68
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,380
You're gonna move, man?
Wanna move a play?

69
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,847
No.

70
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,185
Shit.

71
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,516
Perfect.

72
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,392
Hey. What's up, motherfucker?

73
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,564
-I'm talking to you, motherfucker.
-What do you want, Twitch?

74
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,790
I wanna kick your ass.

75
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,164
-Man, come on, get your ass up.
-You can't be serious.

76
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,771
Nigga, you've been talking shit
about me.

77
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,133
When? What proof you got?

78
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,174
I don't need no proof.
Man, you sound like a lawyer.

79
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,539
How can you see with these
motherfuckers on here--

80
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,738
-Give them back.
-Fuck, no.

81
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,680
Why don't you come get them from me
so I could kick your ass?

82
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,217
You know I'm out in a month.

83
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,651
-I'm not gonna fight you.
-Damn.

84
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,418
-But my bitch will.
-What bitch?

85
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,031
Oh, shit. Okay.
Here. Hey, you gotta--

86
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,262
Come here.

87
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,468
-Fuck, yeah.
-Oh, shit.

88
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,179
Get up and walk.
Get up and walk.

89
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,721
-What was that?
-Easy, easy.

90
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,722
-Get up.
-I'll kick your ass.

91
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:18,158
You make sure you tell the warden
that I started this, you hear me?

92
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,663
You hear me? You tell-- What the fuck
are you--? I'll kick your ass too.

93
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,892
Good morning, gentlemen.
Welcome to Creighton.

94
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,164
My name is Mr. Wallace,
and I'm the warden of this prison.

95
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,428
I wanted to personally greet you
by saying:

96
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,765
I run a tight ship.

97
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:03,840
My prison, my rules.

98
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:08,709
Best advice I can give to you
is keep to yourself...

99
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:11,816
...do your time
and don't break my rules.

100
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,781
No matter how tough
you think you are--

101
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,819
And I know some of you think
you're real tough.

102
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,749
--I will break you.

103
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,989
That's a promise.

104
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,991
Understood?

105
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,222
I got your back. I'm with you.

106
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,466
Step forward.

107
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,771
Listen up, punk.

108
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,644
I know you like to cause problems.
That's why you got sent here.

109
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:50,982
I'm gonna personally see to it
that that doesn't happen anymore.

110
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,559
My officers will resort
to any and all measures necessary...

111
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,592
...to keep you in line.

112
00:09:57,797 --> 00:09:59,560
Understand?

113
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,895
Whatever you say, man. I'm not--

114
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,796
You'll keep your nose clean...

115
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,268
...and stay out of other people's
affairs, won't you?

116
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:11,106
Hey, man, look. You know,
I only concentrate on my own--

117
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:17,082
I'm not sure
I really heard you correctly.

118
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,446
I just want to do my time and leave.

119
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,951
That's what I thought you said.

120
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,150
I'll remember you.

121
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:38,260
Pick up your prison blues
and your shoes.

122
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,564
Show them to their cellblocks.

123
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,234
-Here you go.
-Next.

124
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,206
-Here you go.
-Next.

125
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,646
Here you go.

126
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:50,509
Where you got your soap, kid?

127
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:54,243
Shake my hand.
Come on. Shake my hand.

128
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,072
This shit they call food--

129
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,706
Keep your eyes on the room.

130
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:19,036
-Copy that.
-Anything could be a diversion.

131
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:27,041
Only take one second for these
bastards to start killing each other.

132
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:31,018
Sometimes I wonder why we bother
standing in the way.

133
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,861
How long I gotta wait
in line to get food?

134
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,768
What's up with that?

135
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,240
<i>Baboso wants more money
for bringing in the piece.</i>

136
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,777
<i>Mira, you know
how much that mule was paid?</i>

137
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,915
Let me just cut him a piece.

138
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,983
What if this motherfucker's
double-dealing...

139
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,590
...with the Disciples, homes?

140
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:43,421
-Let me do this.
-Are you sure?

141
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,811
You shouldn't be sitting here,
brother.

142
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,148
Is that right?

143
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,152
Just trying to give you
some friendly advice.

144
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,325
Come with me
or take your chances with them.

145
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,863
-So I should come with you, huh?
-Yeah.

146
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,231
-And not with them?
-Unless you got a loco death wish.

147
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:28,634
And what if I just wanna
kick it here, keep to myself?

148
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:31,469
Then I'd imagine
you'd get two shanks in you.

149
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,110
One from each side.

150
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,787
I don't see no shanks in him.

151
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,152
Burke? Don't go near him.

152
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,518
-Why?
-Because he don't want you to.

153
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:51,787
How you know?

154
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,125
Burke don't give a fuck about
anybody in here but himseIf.

155
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,425
And that's cool for him.

156
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,797
He can fight his own fights.

157
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,031
But you....

158
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,400
...you wouldn't last a heartbeat.

159
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,478
Come on, I think you gonna
need some friends.

160
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,142
Man, you see these?
I don't need shit.

161
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,715
Put that little motherfucker away.
Let's go see Angel.

162
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,595
Good to meet you.
Name's Angel.

163
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,700
My name's Twitch. What's up?

164
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,026
Right on. Shit.

165
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:35,366
I'm from L.A. You know, it's a small
little city. You ever heard of it?

166
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,905
I got people in L.A.

167
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,838
I don't.

168
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,035
You a long way from the ocean.

169
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,238
This ain't Malibu.

170
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:46,509
Every cell is the same to me, man.
Shit, you know--

171
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,552
Ain't the cells
you got to worry about.

172
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,751
-You know who I am?
-Not really, am I su--

173
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,119
Wallace tell you nothing about me
when you got here?

174
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,794
Wallace?

175
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,054
That's the warden, right?

176
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,461
Yeah, he like to think so...

177
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,396
...running around here
giving orders with his hard ass.

178
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,593
But in reality...

179
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,203
...I'm the nigga in charge.

180
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,339
I got what you call arrangements.

181
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,707
So you have any problems...

182
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,479
...or need any favors...

183
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,383
...you come see me.

184
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:21,743
And all I ask in return...

185
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,421
-...is your loyalty.
-Sounds good to me, you know.

186
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,820
-I only--
-You got to wear the mark.

187
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,552
Mark?

188
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,468
Angel of Death.

189
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,430
That's what binds us.

190
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,902
Damn. Y'all ain't got
no other type of membership?

191
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,041
You know, like cards or some shit?

192
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,972
Are you in, brother?

193
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:50,171
Man, I only been here for a day.
Y'all don't even know me.

194
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,043
How you know
I wanna roll with y'all?

195
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,582
Is that a threat?I

196
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,951
-Look, man, I'm just saying, man--
-Either you with us...

197
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,921
...or you with Cortez.

198
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,924
-I ain't with nobody.
-Listen, brother.

199
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,460
There's a war coming on.

200
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,326
You wear this mark, I guarantee
you won't be a casualty.

201
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:12,999
Come on.

202
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,501
Move it.

203
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:20,110
I say we get the brothers together,
man, and make this happen.

204
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,337
-Get up in the line now.
-Get out of my way.

205
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,779
It's just a matter of time before shit
hits the fan with Cortez and his gang.

206
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,316
Be cool, baby, we'll get him.

207
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,487
These motherfuckers.
What are we waiting on?

208
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,156
-We will. We will.
-Come on, when?

209
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:35,088
When the fuck I say so.

210
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:39,094
You think you could run this shit
better than me, huh?

211
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,661
Look. What I'm saying is...

212
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,097
...Cortez is bringing in more guards
and more money...

213
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,464
...while you sit around
waiting on God to give you...

214
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,572
-...a motherfucking message.
-Let me ask you--

215
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,469
What the fuck was that?

216
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,835
You were in my way.

217
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,279
You know something, Burke?

218
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,975
It's about time you fucking learn
how things operate around here.

219
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,710
And you're gonna show me?

220
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:06,914
Yeah. Go ahead.
I'll let you take the first swing.

221
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,426
Fuck up some of that good behavior
you got going.

222
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,564
-Another time, Angel.
-Don't you walk away from me, Burke.

223
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,564
Don't you fucking walk away
from me, Burke!

224
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:21,331
One day. You be ready, Burke.
One day.

225
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,371
Dirt nap.

226
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,440
Come on.

227
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,528
We have a deal, right?

228
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,556
Right?

229
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,294
We got the deal.

230
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,567
Okay.

231
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,224
So you Burke, huh?

232
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,522
Ain't that your name?

233
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,794
You know, I heard that you don't
deal with none of the gangs and....

234
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,701
You don't fool with none of that, huh?

235
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,468
Angel's scared of you.

236
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:09,204
Cortez is afraid of you.

237
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,644
They afraid of me too, you know.

238
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,375
You know, I don't play too much, man.

239
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:18,116
You a loner, huh?

240
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,052
I'm a loner too,
you know what I'm saying.

241
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,194
Ain't too much I do, you know.
I don't really, you know, get involved--

242
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,159
Shut up and keep it that way.

243
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,131
-I'm only trying to make it a little easier.
-Don't.

244
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,443
So what you in for anyway, man?
What, you killed somebody?

245
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,013
What, you robbed a bank
or something?

246
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,776
I was thinking about doing
something like that myself, man.

247
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:51,046
-You could tell me. l'm your boy, man.
-Shut up, will you?

248
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,315
Damn.

249
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,925
Whatever. Shit.

250
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:03,127
You know, if you don't wanna talk
all you gotta do is just say it.

251
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,827
I'm just trying to communicate
with you, you know.

252
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,033
I don't wanna talk.

253
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,704
That's cool.

254
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,220
Here, sit at number three.

255
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,889
You're not gonna see Dad?

256
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,888
Honey, I have nothing to say
to your dad.

257
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,186
Fine.

258
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,999
It's your time.

259
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,639
Gotta go see my woman, man.
Gonna go do it big.

260
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:47,209
I'm gonna talk to you later, huh?
Good conversation.

261
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,016
Don't you listen in on my conversation.

262
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,880
Be cool.

263
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,251
Rise, Rise, Rise.

264
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:02,018
You just had to go and get
your little butt sent to Missouri.

265
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,252
-That's a good thing, ain't it?
-A good thing?

266
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,398
It's harder knowing that you're so close
and I still can't see you.

267
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,998
I know, I know, babe, but look--

268
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,659
And then it's two more weeks
before I can see your sorry ass again.

269
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,863
-I just can't do it, Bernard.
-What's with all this ''Bernard'' shit?

270
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,974
I told you,
don't you call me Bernard here.

271
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,610
My name's Twitch. Twitch.

272
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,712
Don't you forget that, woman.

273
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:26,577
Don't you ''woman'' me, Bernard.
I put up with enough from you, okay?

274
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,754
I looked the other way
when you had that fat-ass girlfriend.

275
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,479
What was you doing with her anyway?

276
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,181
All she was gonna do was give you
some fat-ass children.

277
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,123
That wasn't fat, that was muscle.

278
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:41,026
Look, I know, baby, a lot of times
it seems like I take you for granted--

279
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,360
Oh, you take me for granted
all the time.

280
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,804
I ain't that bad.
I got you the ring, didn't I?

281
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:48,632
This shit probably ain't even real.

282
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,001
I don't know when you plan
on having the wedding...

283
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,938
...but I am calling it off.

284
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,113
Yes, I'm calling it off, okay?

285
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,804
Your momma gonna be so upset.

286
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,643
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on, baby.
Hold on, now.

287
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,952
I know I make a lot of promises.

288
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,987
Yeah. You make a lot of promises,
like you gonna marry me...

289
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,658
...like you love me,
like you gonna get parole.

290
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,521
-But--
-You never deliver on the promises.

291
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,959
Ever. How am I supposed to trust you?

292
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,565
First of all, I am getting parole, Cherise.

293
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,701
-When?
-Soon.

294
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,468
Hello, Amy.

295
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,974
Hey, Ellie.

296
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,212
You look great.

297
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,082
You changed your hair, didn't you?

298
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,718
-I like it.
-Thanks.

299
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,388
-How's school, baby?
-It's summer.

300
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,850
Oh, sorry.

301
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,894
-No, this is it, Bernard. I'm leaving.
-Wait, wait, hold on.

302
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,833
All right, now.

303
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,128
I gotta tell you something.
I am getting out, okay?

304
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,305
-I just--
-Forget you, Bernard.

305
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:57,873
Just listen to me, okay?
Damn.

306
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:00,237
What I'm talking about
has to do with our future.

307
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:03,676
Okay. All right. You know,
this better be real good.

308
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,009
It is good. Now, I got a plan.

309
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,278
-A plan?
-Yeah, a plan.

310
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:10,848
It's gonna get us rich.

311
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,547
What the hell are you thinking?
You gonna get rich in here?

312
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,283
You sound like some kind of fool.

313
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,952
Who are you talking to?
Now, just listen to me.

314
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:21,758
Me getting transferred here
was a part of the plan.

315
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,867
-What you mean?
-I mean...

316
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,934
...I got transferred here
on purpose.

317
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,003
Now I know you's a fool.

318
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:31,937
Man, listen. I got about a month
to get up out this joint, okay?

319
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,772
-You mean, escape?
-Just keep it down!

320
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,313
I am not having no fugitive husband.

321
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,315
And I for sure ain't having
no fugitive baby daddy.

322
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:46,447
Now, what I'm about to do
is gonna set us up for life.

323
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,355
-Really? Man, are you serious?
-Trust me.

324
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,260
And then I'll get you
anything you want.

325
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:59,501
All I want is for you to come home.

326
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:05,175
Well, listen to me, baby. I could set up
a little ''home sweet home'' right here.

327
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:09,837
Set up one of those little conjugal
visiting rooms, you know what I mean.

328
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:14,951
-Slide you something special.
-Really? You could make that happen?

329
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:18,520
You know I can. They don't call me
''The Alaskan Pipeline'' for nothing.

330
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,248
Oh, I mean, really, for real
we can really get a room, baby?

331
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,451
Yeah. Twitch will take care of it.

332
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:27,393
But I heard you have to arrange those
visits, like, weeks in advance, Bernard.

333
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,624
And plus I think you gotta be married.

334
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:33,794
Didn't I say Twitch will take care of it?

335
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,608
-Really?
-Now give it to me, give it here.

336
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,538
Oh, chubblies.

337
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,078
-Don't look at me.
-Let's go, time's up.

338
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,218
Shit. One month.

339
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,954
Mind your business.

340
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:55,157
I'm gonna be leaving.

341
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,387
-What do you mean?
-Me and Mom are moving to Dallas.

342
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,565
Dallas?

343
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,700
So I don't know when I'll be able
to visit you again.

344
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,708
This is your mother's idea, isn't it?

345
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,509
Please don't be mad at her, okay?

346
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:17,672
I'm gonna start college next year...

347
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,852
...so I probably won't have the chance
to visit you.

348
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:28,983
You know, I'd like to spend more time
with you, but you're stuck in here, Dad.

349
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,288
And I know it wasn't your fault,
but it happened.

350
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,735
Look at me, Ellie.

351
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,866
Just tell me you know
how much I love you, baby.

352
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:01,515
What you gonna do with that?

353
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,660
Angel about to bless you.

354
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,193
But I ain't sneezed.

355
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,130
-Man up, little nigga.
-Oh, hell, no.

356
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,665
Get off me, man.

357
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,432
Wait, hold on. Wait. Wait.

358
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,271
Fuck!

359
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,512
Damn it.

360
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,377
Get off me. God.

361
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,687
Cherise is waiting for me.

362
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:43,629
Honeymoon suite be ready
in about 1 0 minutes.

363
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:49,468
My sugar pot's ready
for some honey loving.

364
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,905
Me too, baby. He won't be able
to walk after I'm done with him.

365
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:57,707
Nope. He won't be able to walk,
my baby.

366
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,053
You wink at me, bitch?

367
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,988
What's up, big papa?

368
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,175
All right. Let's go.

369
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,003
Come on, Burke.
You're on cafeteria duty.

370
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:34,377
Open them up.
Is Cherise down there, man?

371
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,453
-What's going on, Lewis?
-Detector's not functioning.

372
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,420
Are you for real?

373
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:44,061
Come on, man, I ain't got no metal on,
I ain't got no handcuffs.

374
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:47,095
-Come on. Cherise is down there.
-You wanna be strip-searched instead?

375
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,232
Yeah. I'm gonna get naked, all right...

376
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,129
...in there, not out here.

377
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,697
Yo, what you looking at?

378
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,932
Angel!

379
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,811
Burke!

380
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,862
JT, snatch the gun, man.

381
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,868
Damn, Angel.

382
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:06,844
Don't touch him.

383
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,445
-I was just closing his eyes.
-Don't fucking touch him.

384
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,808
I want ten grand on Burke's head.
He's fucking dead.

385
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,222
Back off! Back off.

386
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,828
But it ain't working, man.

387
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,329
Cherise! Let me go.

388
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,207
You'll never have to bother
with that man again.

389
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,281
Stop it, Mom. He's my dad.

390
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,419
What kind of father
has he been to you?

391
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,331
Wallace, there's a riot.
We need a lockdown.

392
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,261
Cellblock C in the cafeteria.

393
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,261
There's a riot in the cafeteria.
Put it in lockdown.

394
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,304
-I'm on it.
-Right away, sir.

395
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,872
Come on, we're leaving.

396
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:14,875
<i>All cells in lockdown.
I repeat. Prisoners, back to your cells.</i>

397
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,206
-Did you hear that?
-Put it back. Put it down.

398
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,441
I didn't do nothing, man.
The lockdown is down there.

399
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,491
-Could you open this?
-I can't open the gate.

400
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,684
-The whole prison's on lockdown.
-Lockdown?

401
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,726
You're not gonna be able to stay.
You gotta go.

402
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,126
-Oh, my God.
-You gotta go now.

403
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,358
Oh, my God. Ellie, run!

404
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,163
Oh, God. Run, Ellie, run!

405
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,014
Y'all not the police.
You're the no-lease.

406
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,706
I'll kick your ass.
Take these off.

407
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,389
-Down.
-Down.

408
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,531
What's going on, man?

409
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,438
Burke killed Angel.

410
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:19,200
Fuck, are you for real?

411
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,473
What you gonna do,
you gonna kill me?

412
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,410
Give me one reason why I shouldn't.

413
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,192
You get a free pass this time.

414
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,698
But don't ever let me
see you again, huh?

415
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:53,740
Fuck.

416
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:57,572
-Did you see who it was?
-No, I didn't get a look.

417
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,285
Manual override.

418
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:01,107
Perimeter gates are all shut.

419
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:02,470
C block's still open.

420
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,610
How the hell--? Can we override?

421
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,048
I'm trying, but it's not working.

422
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,084
Get a team down there.

423
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:16,283
Response team to C-block right away.
I repeat, response team to C-block.

424
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,089
Now D-block's open.

425
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,926
Who's doing this?

426
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:25,193
Should I send in ERT, sir?

427
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,236
-Affirmative.
-Yes, sir.

428
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,005
Easiest ten grand I ever made.

429
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,278
There's a price on your head
and I'm collecting.

430
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,388
Burke, you popped Angel,
this is what you get.

431
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,544
Come here. Get back here.

432
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,772
Get him back here now.

433
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,453
Burke.

434
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,888
Come here.

435
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,755
You move and I'll snap you.

436
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:02,160
I ain't going nowhere, but I don't think
that's gonna stop him from shooting.

437
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:05,096
Yeah, like he's gonna shoot a brother.

438
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,203
Back off or I'll break his neck.

439
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,963
-Hey, do as he say--
-Shut up.

440
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:12,768
-This motherfucker killed Angel.
-I'm gonna count to three.

441
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:16,538
-One.
-Drop-- Drop the heat, JT.

442
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,316
-JT, he's one of us, man.
-No, he isn't.

443
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:24,716
Three.

444
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,255
There's nowhere to hide.

445
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,793
I own this motherfucker.

446
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,195
Gotta hold on. Move.

447
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,563
I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you.

448
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:44,400
Stop where you are!
Stop where you are!

449
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,840
Well, it's about time, Bernard.

450
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,120
You in the wrong room.
You probably down the hall.

451
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,546
Girl, what's wrong with you?
You okay?

452
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,190
You don't know what's going on?

453
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,991
This whole place is in lockdown.
There's a riot going on.

454
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,686
-Oh, my God. Are you serious?
-Yes.

455
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,230
Okay. We can't stay in here.

456
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,731
The door doesn't lock.

457
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,411
Halt, you men,
I will shoot if you don't!

458
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:26,675
I will shoot you.

459
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:31,547
-You ain't gonna kill me, is you, man?
-If you don't shut the fuck up, I will.

460
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:34,224
You don't look like a killer.
But you'd best snap my neck.

461
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:38,225
And you don't want 10 added to the 10
you already getting for killing Angel.

462
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:41,865
l didn't kill Angel. Get out of here.

463
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,658
Go on!

464
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,645
-Coming this way.
-Crazy.

465
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,080
-Shit.
-Coming this way.

466
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:05,721
-Told y'all.
-Move back, back!

467
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,492
Shit.

468
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,836
-Move. Move. Go.
-Stay where you are!

469
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,440
Oh, shit.

470
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,003
Guards are coming!

471
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,049
Hey, get him.
He's one of Angel's gang.

472
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,653
Rivera.

473
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,295
Oh, come on, man.
I ain't got no problem with y'all.

474
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,993
-You're one of Angel's disciples, huh?
-Who?

475
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,064
I don't even know the guy.
What's his name again?

476
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,504
Oh, come on, man. Swear to God.

477
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,504
Look, man, I'm just trying
to ease on through-- What--?

478
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:07,946
That's pretty, man. Well,
I guess God don't believe you today.

479
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,813
Back off.

480
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:12,148
Get off.

481
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,596
Hey, what's up, big papa?

482
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,325
You need to stay out of this,
because it's got nothing to do with you.

483
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:28,596
Oh, it doesn't? Where's Cortez?

484
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,036
Cortez got less to do with your ass.

485
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,809
-Is he trying to escape?
-Escape?

486
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:38,841
-Twitch, get the fuck out of here.
-Man, what you want with me for?

487
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,309
Wanna stay here and play around
with these guys? Now, go.

488
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,387
Lucky he came. I'll kick your ass.

489
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,990
Don't fuck with me.

490
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:53,261
That was a good job, you know.
Clipping Angel's wings.

491
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,125
Saved me the fucking trouble.

492
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:01,861
Hey, aren't you gonna go, no?

493
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,734
I set him up, bro.

494
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,432
I'm gonna let the guards do it for us.

495
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,012
Go over there and spread out.

496
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,582
Let's go, let's go!

497
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,292
Check that gate.

498
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,565
They're all locked.

499
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,295
What do we have here?

500
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:39,935
-Please. Please.
-So beautiful.

501
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:42,375
You're so tender.

502
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,377
Hey, big dog,
Rivera sent me to find you.

503
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,550
Where'd you get
these fine little honeys at?

504
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,015
-Back off, homes.
-Hey, there's two of them.

505
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,710
You got that one, I got this one--

506
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:55,055
<i>I told you to back off, mano.</i>

507
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,428
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

508
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,291
Bitch.

509
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:06,028
<i>All right, ése.
We'll see what's up later, right?</i>

510
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,761
See you.

511
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:12,632
I have plans for both of you.

512
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:14,504
Move!

513
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,655
I could have handled that
all by myself back there.

514
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,827
Yeah, right.

515
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:34,691
As long as JT and everybody else
thinks I killed Angel, I'm a marked man.

516
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:37,459
This way, they gotta shoot
their own brother to get to me.

517
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,135
Man, these guys ain't my brothers.

518
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:42,100
I told you before, Burke, I'm a loner.

519
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,330
I don't care about no one.

520
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,835
Just like you, man.

521
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:51,012
-Come on.
-I got somebody I care about.

522
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,915
You ladies picked
the wrong day to visit.

523
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,585
You leave this room and you're dead.

524
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:08,497
Oh, God, he locked us in.

525
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:12,032
We're gonna have to stay calm.
We're gonna have to try and stay calm.

526
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,563
Goddamn it.

527
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,388
We lost power, warden.

528
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,001
But we're switching
to emergency generators right now.

529
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:48,905
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

530
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,574
Trying to figure a way out of here.

531
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:55,601
I saw on TV that the safest thing to do
at a time like this is to sit and wait.

532
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,373
Are you crazy?
That is not the safest thing.

533
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:01,346
Any minute that guy could be back
and shoot either one of us.

534
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:03,577
If we do get out,
it might get us both killed.

535
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:07,348
Well, you know what? You take your
chances here, I'll take mine out there.

536
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,924
Let's say you do get out.
What-- What-- What then?

537
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,594
There's a riot on the other side.

538
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:15,060
Do you really think
you're gonna get out through that?

539
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,694
-You have no idea--
-Shut up.

540
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,563
What?

541
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:22,772
Real smart.

542
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,964
I don't think just because
you're big and tall...

543
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,336
...that you can open that
without a key.

544
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:32,538
You are just begging for me
to kick your ass, aren't you?

545
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,843
Worse than the police, man.

546
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,111
Get off me, man.
You make me nervous.

547
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,256
-You got a bull's-eye on your back.
-I didn't kill Angel.

548
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,857
-Well, who did, then?
-Cortez.

549
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,292
Angel!

550
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,040
-Cortez?
-Yeah.

551
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,210
Oh, I get it.

552
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,641
The riots, the distraction.

553
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:06,282
Then you'll hook up with him later,
and y'all gonna fly off in the sunset.

554
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:09,145
But not without me. I got value.
You take me with you.

555
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:12,254
-You'll just slow me down.
-Slow you down?

556
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,549
You the big meathead, motherfucker.

557
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,623
-Burke!
-You--

558
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,621
-Get in the cell--
-Relax. I don't wanna hurt you.

559
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,764
-Get in the cell--
-Relax.

560
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,402
Oh, fuck.

561
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,339
Come on.

562
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,305
Get them all locked in there.

563
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,512
Burke, Burke, Burke.

564
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,786
<i>-There's other juras I can hurt.
-That's right.</i>

565
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,349
Let's go!

566
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:48,889
-Come on!
-Okay, okay, come on.

567
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:52,723
Bitch.

568
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,325
Beat your ass.

569
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:59,269
You know, my fiancé Bernard
could get this thing open in a second.

570
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,028
He was a master thief.

571
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:04,139
Real stupid, too.
Got himself caught up.

572
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:07,276
I've been waiting for that man for years.

573
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,179
What about you?
Who were you here to see?

574
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,476
My dad.

575
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,351
How long has he been in?

576
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,146
Two years and four more to go.

577
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,155
Let me try.

578
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,761
Oh, goodness, I hope Bernard didn't go
get himself in no more trouble.

579
00:44:40,985 --> 00:44:43,419
-Would you look at that?
-They're dead.

580
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:46,049
<i>-All units--!
-Hey, come on.</i>

581
00:44:46,257 --> 00:44:47,656
<i>--cell block C.</i>

582
00:44:47,858 --> 00:44:50,656
Get the walkie, man. It might--
Goddamn it!

583
00:44:51,395 --> 00:44:53,556
-Two guards are dead.
-Jesus.

584
00:44:53,764 --> 00:44:55,664
Surveillance confirms
both were last seen...

585
00:44:55,866 --> 00:44:58,528
...with the transfer from New Alcatraz
when the riot started.

586
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:04,335
All officers fall back
behind the perimeter.

587
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:08,308
Fall back behind the perimeter.
Meet at security checkpoints.

588
00:45:08,512 --> 00:45:09,877
You're clearing all cellblocks?

589
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,776
I'm pulling my men out
until they've all got body armor...

590
00:45:12,983 --> 00:45:14,644
...and something to fight back with.

591
00:45:14,852 --> 00:45:16,683
All officers, pull back.

592
00:45:16,887 --> 00:45:21,586
Convene in the armory for body armor
and riot gear for ERT response.

593
00:45:23,994 --> 00:45:25,427
Yes?

594
00:45:27,665 --> 00:45:29,656
-Sir.
-What?

595
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:32,495
There's an inmate on line 101.

596
00:45:32,703 --> 00:45:35,831
-What?
-It's Alex Cortez.

597
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:40,036
Put him through.

598
00:45:44,048 --> 00:45:47,575
Alex? Where are you?
What phone are you on?

599
00:45:47,785 --> 00:45:51,448
You don't get to ask questions.
You get to take orders.

600
00:45:51,655 --> 00:45:53,987
Or else more body bags
are coming out the front gate.

601
00:45:54,191 --> 00:45:56,751
If I find out you're responsible
for anyone's death--

602
00:45:56,961 --> 00:45:58,053
<i>Shut up, fool.</i>

603
00:45:58,729 --> 00:46:00,697
I'm doing life without parole.

604
00:46:00,898 --> 00:46:02,160
Don't threaten me again.

605
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,467
-What phone is he on?
-It's impossible to tell.

606
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,935
Here's what you're gonna do.
Call the governor.

607
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,664
Tell him to get in his helicopter...

608
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:14,139
...and fly his fat ass
out here immediately.

609
00:46:14,678 --> 00:46:17,442
I don't think I have the authority
to make that happen.

610
00:46:17,648 --> 00:46:19,980
If you can't, the hostages die.

611
00:46:20,484 --> 00:46:22,384
You have hostages?

612
00:46:22,586 --> 00:46:26,955
<i>Yeah. Two beautiful young ladies.</i>

613
00:46:27,324 --> 00:46:30,384
Not the kind of people you people
don't give a damn about.

614
00:46:30,594 --> 00:46:34,428
Make it happen, Wallace.
Don't forget the helicopter.

615
00:46:39,203 --> 00:46:42,570
Check the visitor records.
Find out if anyone is unaccounted for.

616
00:46:44,675 --> 00:46:46,870
-Get me the governor.
-Yes, sir, right away.

617
00:46:49,213 --> 00:46:52,205
Call the warden.
Get us the fuck out of here.

618
00:46:53,384 --> 00:46:55,113
We're in lockdown, governor.

619
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:57,685
The two cellblocks
have been manually overridden.

620
00:46:57,888 --> 00:47:00,652
<i>-How is that possible?
-We're not exactly sure, sir.</i>

621
00:47:01,025 --> 00:47:04,517
It seems some inmates have gained
access to one of the control panels.

622
00:47:04,728 --> 00:47:05,717
What's their motive?

623
00:47:06,363 --> 00:47:10,026
It's gang-related. They're at war, sir.
Total chaos.

624
00:47:10,234 --> 00:47:11,360
Can you contain it?

625
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:15,796
We're trying, sir. Emergency Response
Teams have been deployed.

626
00:47:16,006 --> 00:47:18,304
But there have been
some officer fatalities.

627
00:47:18,509 --> 00:47:21,910
Damn it, Wallace. I mean, it's the last
thing we need in an election year.

628
00:47:22,479 --> 00:47:26,006
-How many officers?
-Three that we know of for sure.

629
00:47:26,216 --> 00:47:30,414
All right. Look, you need to end this
thing quickly, no matter what it takes.

630
00:47:30,621 --> 00:47:33,556
<i>All right?
But protect our people at all cost.</i>

631
00:47:33,757 --> 00:47:34,985
<i>Has the press been notified?</i>

632
00:47:35,192 --> 00:47:37,524
No, sir. We've been able
to keep a lid on that.

633
00:47:37,928 --> 00:47:42,422
All right. My office will handle
all the press from this end.

634
00:47:42,633 --> 00:47:45,101
Just a minute. Charlie.
Hey, call the airport...

635
00:47:45,302 --> 00:47:48,271
...make sure the helicopter's ready,
wheels up in 20 minutes.

636
00:47:48,472 --> 00:47:50,372
We're going to Creighton.

637
00:47:50,574 --> 00:47:51,541
I'm on my way.

638
00:47:51,742 --> 00:47:53,334
Yes, sir.

639
00:48:00,517 --> 00:48:03,247
-Here we go.
-Tell me why you got transferred here.

640
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:05,880
-Tell me.
-What, you don't know?

641
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,752
-Bullshit about a fight.
-It was more than a fight.

642
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,393
It's three of them and they thought
because I'm little...

643
00:48:11,628 --> 00:48:14,688
...I couldn't whoop that ass,
but I got this thing I did:

644
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,859
-You can't fight worth a shit.
-Shut up.

645
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:20,696
Kick your ass.

646
00:48:20,904 --> 00:48:23,372
-What?
-If my ankle didn't hurt.

647
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:27,875
Hey, quit lying to me.
Why'd you get transferred here?

648
00:48:28,078 --> 00:48:32,640
I-- I wanted to be closer
to my fiancée, Cherise.

649
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:35,148
-You're lying.
-No, I'm not.

650
00:48:35,352 --> 00:48:36,410
Your eyes are moving...

651
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:38,611
-...and you're lying.
-My eyes always move.

652
00:48:38,822 --> 00:48:42,485
Yeah, that's my point exactly.
Why'd you get transferred here?

653
00:48:42,693 --> 00:48:44,388
Look, I can't swim.

654
00:48:44,895 --> 00:48:47,921
Creighton has no water or sharks.

655
00:48:48,132 --> 00:48:52,865
You're telling me you got transferred
here just so you could escape?

656
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:56,870
Goddamn right.
I'm a crazy motherfucker.

657
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:00,634
No shit.

658
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,774
There's the motherfucker
that killed Angel.

659
00:49:07,117 --> 00:49:09,085
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait!

660
00:49:21,465 --> 00:49:23,160
-Come on.
-Bitch!

661
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,464
Any luck?

662
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:28,467
It's not working.

663
00:49:28,872 --> 00:49:31,102
Just keep trying.

664
00:49:31,742 --> 00:49:33,369
Been trying.

665
00:49:34,611 --> 00:49:36,238
Look, we need another way.

666
00:49:36,446 --> 00:49:39,142
God knows when that guy
is gonna come back.

667
00:49:43,754 --> 00:49:45,619
This is creepy.

668
00:49:46,623 --> 00:49:48,454
It's where people watch
the executions.

669
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:50,126
Yeah.

670
00:49:50,327 --> 00:49:53,057
-I could never do it.
-Do what?

671
00:49:53,463 --> 00:49:56,125
Just sit there and watch people die.

672
00:49:59,837 --> 00:50:02,305
We gotta get this door open.
It's our only way out.

673
00:50:18,755 --> 00:50:20,780
You tried to get out?

674
00:50:21,391 --> 00:50:24,292
After what we just said to you?

675
00:50:30,601 --> 00:50:32,330
Tie her up.

676
00:50:33,804 --> 00:50:35,669
What the hell is wrong with you?

677
00:50:37,574 --> 00:50:41,704
I said, tie her up.

678
00:50:59,196 --> 00:51:01,596
It's too much like Alcatraz.

679
00:51:02,266 --> 00:51:04,826
Eric, make sure each officer gets one.

680
00:51:05,035 --> 00:51:08,300
Robert, back to the office
and monitor everything from there.

681
00:51:08,505 --> 00:51:11,668
All right, everybody. Time to move.

682
00:51:13,944 --> 00:51:17,072
All officers,
this is the warden speaking.

683
00:51:17,281 --> 00:51:20,614
<i>Take back control
one cellblock at a time.</i>

684
00:51:20,817 --> 00:51:23,251
<i>There's some inmates
to be on the lookout for.</i>

685
00:51:23,453 --> 00:51:27,253
<i>One William Burke.
One Bernard ''Twitch'' Washington.</i>

686
00:51:27,457 --> 00:51:29,618
<i>Both suspects
in the murder of two guards.</i>

687
00:51:29,826 --> 00:51:31,054
Did he just say my name?

688
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:34,124
<i>Twitch is the transfer
from New Alcatraz.</i>

689
00:51:34,331 --> 00:51:36,458
<i>Both he and Burke
are likely armed.</i>

690
00:51:36,667 --> 00:51:38,498
No, no, we ain't, man.
Tell him we're not.

691
00:51:38,702 --> 00:51:40,602
<i>Try to take them alive.</i>

692
00:51:40,804 --> 00:51:42,738
<i>-Shoot to kill if you have to.
-Give me that.</i>

693
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:46,467
-Man, you ain't talking to him.
-Look, I've gotta clear my name, Burke.

694
00:51:47,411 --> 00:51:49,845
We've got another situation
we gotta handle.

695
00:51:50,047 --> 00:51:53,915
Another inmate, Alex Cortez,
has taken hostages inside.

696
00:51:54,117 --> 00:51:55,516
We don't know exactly
how many...

697
00:51:55,719 --> 00:51:59,018
...but we believe
there are two missing visitors.

698
00:51:59,222 --> 00:52:01,816
-One Cherise--
-Hey, man, give me this thing.

699
00:52:02,025 --> 00:52:03,185
Wallace.

700
00:52:03,393 --> 00:52:04,985
-You there?
-Who's this?

701
00:52:05,195 --> 00:52:06,594
This is Twitch, man.

702
00:52:06,797 --> 00:52:08,788
Just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

703
00:52:08,999 --> 00:52:13,299
Hey, man, why you got this APB
out on me, man? I ain't kill nobody.

704
00:52:13,503 --> 00:52:15,164
No one's accused you of anything.

705
00:52:15,672 --> 00:52:18,140
Yeah, you did. You got the APB
cracking on us, man.

706
00:52:18,675 --> 00:52:21,143
<i>Rioters everywhere, man.
That's not due process.</i>

707
00:52:21,345 --> 00:52:24,781
Okay, then turn yourself in
and let's clear this up.

708
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:28,675
-What? What is it?
-We're not meeting him.

709
00:52:28,885 --> 00:52:31,979
<i>-Twitch, are you there?
-Yeah, man.</i>

710
00:52:32,189 --> 00:52:34,714
Well, what do you say?
About going over this face to face?

711
00:52:36,326 --> 00:52:37,520
I know how that one works.

712
00:52:37,728 --> 00:52:39,787
We get there
and all your guard dogs are there.

713
00:52:39,997 --> 00:52:41,794
<i>You can forget that one, buddy.</i>

714
00:52:41,999 --> 00:52:44,058
My men won't harm you, I promise.

715
00:52:45,102 --> 00:52:47,502
Man, you gonna call the APB off
or what, Wallace?

716
00:52:47,704 --> 00:52:50,070
Just tell me where you are
and we'll work this--

717
00:52:50,273 --> 00:52:51,865
You're not gonna meet with him.

718
00:52:52,109 --> 00:52:54,703
Man, this is bullshit.
This prison's full of shit.

719
00:52:56,346 --> 00:52:57,313
Twitch?

720
00:53:02,185 --> 00:53:05,780
Twitch. Goddamn it, let's go.

721
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:07,752
Open it.

722
00:53:14,598 --> 00:53:19,968
<i>The second hostage is Ellie Burke,
daughter of inmate William Burke.</i>

723
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,871
Keep your eyes right. Move it out.
Keep your eyes right. Move it.

724
00:53:42,092 --> 00:53:44,253
<i>Hey, perro. Look at this.
Handle it.</i>

725
00:53:44,461 --> 00:53:46,361
Hurry up, men. Hurry up.

726
00:53:51,268 --> 00:53:52,758
Where's Burke?

727
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:54,436
I don't know.

728
00:53:55,405 --> 00:53:58,533
-Are you sure?
-I don't give a damn about Burke.

729
00:53:58,742 --> 00:54:01,768
-You, motherfu--
-Wow, easy, easy. Easy.

730
00:54:04,414 --> 00:54:05,745
Is that right?

731
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:07,041
<i>Where's your jefe?</i>

732
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,011
I don't give a damn about him, either.

733
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:11,881
You see, because he fucked me over
with his escape plan, man.

734
00:54:12,789 --> 00:54:15,417
-Escape plan?
-That's right. He took hostages.

735
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:18,423
And, you know,
one of them is Burke's daughter.

736
00:54:18,628 --> 00:54:22,496
That's right. Yeah. And he's going
to use them to get out of here.

737
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:24,826
Bet you didn't know that, huh?

738
00:54:26,503 --> 00:54:28,596
<i>Hey, perro, that's the police
with riot gear.</i>

739
00:54:28,805 --> 00:54:30,329
-Stop!
-This don't look good, man.

740
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,770
Show these motherfuckers
who run this place!

741
00:55:42,879 --> 00:55:44,506
Tear gas.

742
00:55:47,184 --> 00:55:48,549
Get out of here.

743
00:56:12,075 --> 00:56:14,236
Keep going, man. What?

744
00:56:20,283 --> 00:56:22,877
-Let's move it, dog. Let's move.
-Fuck you.

745
00:56:30,594 --> 00:56:32,255
I don't like the way this shit sounds.

746
00:56:32,462 --> 00:56:35,158
It don't sound like they're handling
this too good, man.

747
00:56:35,365 --> 00:56:37,265
Cortez ain't gonna surrender, man.

748
00:56:37,467 --> 00:56:40,265
-We gotta get to him first.
-Look, I've been here before.

749
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:41,698
Nobody wins.

750
00:56:42,439 --> 00:56:44,066
What are you talking about?

751
00:56:44,274 --> 00:56:45,332
The Rock.

752
00:56:45,809 --> 00:56:49,301
New Alcatraz.
Man, I did five years, man.

753
00:56:49,512 --> 00:56:52,481
One night, man,
it was just raining like fuck, man.

754
00:56:52,682 --> 00:56:55,048
Fucking helicopter crashed
into the roof, man.

755
00:56:58,922 --> 00:57:00,480
No!

756
00:57:19,109 --> 00:57:22,237
People started coming out, man,
shooting people with all kinds of guns.

757
00:57:38,561 --> 00:57:42,622
lnmates died, guards died, you know.
A lot of shit was going on, man.

758
00:57:42,832 --> 00:57:45,767
Come on, I lost a lot of people
in there, man.

759
00:57:45,969 --> 00:57:47,197
People that I cared about.

760
00:57:49,639 --> 00:57:50,901
No!

761
00:57:51,775 --> 00:57:53,402
No! No!

762
00:57:58,548 --> 00:58:00,072
God.

763
00:58:04,621 --> 00:58:07,715
Why the hell would guys
break into prison?

764
00:58:08,692 --> 00:58:10,990
Man, none of that matters to me.
Just listen to me.

765
00:58:11,194 --> 00:58:13,890
A lot of shit happened, okay?

766
00:58:14,097 --> 00:58:18,158
-I ain't trying to go through shit again.
-Look, man, this time's different.

767
00:58:18,368 --> 00:58:20,029
Follow me.

768
00:58:23,673 --> 00:58:25,573
How we gonna--? Damn....

769
00:58:25,775 --> 00:58:28,801
Look, I could teach you some shit.
Man, I should just--

770
00:58:29,012 --> 00:58:31,378
-Hey, no.
-Big bad Burke.

771
00:58:33,049 --> 00:58:37,145
Yeah, you couldn't do it like a man.
You had to do it like a little bitch.

772
00:58:37,354 --> 00:58:39,652
-It's not what you think.
-You know what I'm thinking?

773
00:58:39,856 --> 00:58:41,346
Yeah, I didn't kill Angel.

774
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,588
Oh, so you still can't admit that shit?

775
00:58:43,793 --> 00:58:46,023
I'd respect you more
if you could admit that shit.

776
00:58:46,229 --> 00:58:47,958
So we gonna do this like men.

777
00:58:48,164 --> 00:58:49,688
Old-school style.

778
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,294
Do what you gotta do.

779
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:23,859
Now, see, that was just the appetizer.

780
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:25,466
Now it's time for the main course.

781
00:59:25,668 --> 00:59:28,364
We're gonna cut your ass up,
make you into some Chinese food...

782
00:59:28,571 --> 00:59:30,630
...and serve you to the skinheads.

783
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:34,405
Look at me. Yeah.

784
00:59:35,178 --> 00:59:37,169
Old-school style.

785
00:59:41,151 --> 00:59:43,016
Take this motherfucker
to the cafeteria.

786
00:59:43,219 --> 00:59:44,811
Yeah.

787
00:59:57,801 --> 01:00:00,201
Get that fryer going. Get it going.

788
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:03,566
Yeah, yeah. This will do.

789
01:00:05,975 --> 01:00:08,876
This is what we're gonna do.
What it look like?

790
01:00:09,078 --> 01:00:11,569
Looks like you gonna
cook something.

791
01:00:12,215 --> 01:00:14,945
Cortez killed Angel, not me.

792
01:00:16,186 --> 01:00:18,154
-Oh, fuck, man.
-Let him go.

793
01:00:18,354 --> 01:00:20,754
-Easy, easy, cool. Let him go.
-I'll whoop your ass.

794
01:00:20,957 --> 01:00:21,924
Easy.

795
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:24,184
Come on, JT, listen to me.
Listen to me.

796
01:00:25,161 --> 01:00:28,756
I ain't gonna say nothing to nobody,
you already know that.

797
01:00:28,965 --> 01:00:31,525
What about the rest
of these motherfuckers, shit?

798
01:00:31,734 --> 01:00:34,498
Is everybody else gonna be quiet
about the whole thing?

799
01:00:34,704 --> 01:00:37,104
-What the hell is you saying, Twitch?
-I'm just saying...

800
01:00:37,307 --> 01:00:39,298
...we gonna kill this motherfucker,
right?

801
01:00:39,509 --> 01:00:42,672
I mean, what, is everybody else
gonna be quiet about the whole thing?

802
01:00:43,313 --> 01:00:46,373
-Damn right.
-And take it to their grave?

803
01:00:48,852 --> 01:00:50,820
I mean, fuck it, cook him.

804
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,614
If anybody gonna speak
a word about this, it's you.

805
01:00:53,957 --> 01:00:56,824
Snitch.
Now get the fuck out the way.

806
01:00:57,026 --> 01:00:59,460
Fellas, we gonna have
''sum dumb fuck'' on the menu.

807
01:00:59,662 --> 01:01:02,563
-Shit. Quit pushing.
-It's too bad, Burke.

808
01:01:02,765 --> 01:01:05,393
You won't get a chance
to save your daughter.

809
01:01:05,602 --> 01:01:07,763
Oh, you didn't know, did you?

810
01:01:08,505 --> 01:01:12,168
This motherfucker didn't know
Cortez had his daughter as hostage.

811
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:15,173
It's a first-class ticket
out of motherfucking paradise.

812
01:01:32,829 --> 01:01:35,730
Yeah, and after Cortez,
I got next, motherfucker.

813
01:01:49,112 --> 01:01:51,774
Come here, come on, Burke.
Burke, Burke, Burke, come on.

814
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:54,711
We gotta go. We gotta go.

815
01:02:19,442 --> 01:02:21,933
-I don't like the sound of this.
-I'm going after Cortez.

816
01:02:22,145 --> 01:02:24,375
-You going after him?
-He's got my daughter.

817
01:02:24,581 --> 01:02:27,550
You wanna escape? Go ahead.

818
01:02:28,217 --> 01:02:29,946
You tripping.

819
01:02:35,992 --> 01:02:37,926
Hey, Burke. Hold on, man.

820
01:02:38,528 --> 01:02:40,928
Wallace, is the governor on his way?

821
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:43,824
<i>What do you want with him?</i>

822
01:02:53,309 --> 01:02:56,073
This is the governor. I'm on my way.
ETA 30 minutes.

823
01:02:56,279 --> 01:02:58,577
I want the whole prison locked down
by the time I get there.

824
01:02:59,082 --> 01:03:01,346
Now, we've got another situation
we've gotta handle.

825
01:03:01,551 --> 01:03:05,146
<i>Two guards are confirmed dead.
We have suspects.</i>

826
01:03:05,355 --> 01:03:07,721
<i>Our men are tracking them now.</i>

827
01:03:07,924 --> 01:03:10,722
I want those guys caught.
Dead or alive.

828
01:03:10,927 --> 01:03:12,019
<i>Doesn't matter to me.</i>

829
01:03:12,729 --> 01:03:15,323
Make sure you keep the situation
under control.

830
01:03:15,531 --> 01:03:17,795
I'll be there as soon as I can.

831
01:03:21,904 --> 01:03:24,771
Wait, wait. Hold on, Burke.

832
01:03:24,974 --> 01:03:27,135
-Hold on. Damn.
-Shit.

833
01:03:27,343 --> 01:03:30,210
-Come on, give me a hand.
-Wait, wait, wait. Let me try this.

834
01:03:30,413 --> 01:03:31,846
Pull.

835
01:03:32,048 --> 01:03:34,039
<i>-Just....
-Over here, hermano.</i>

836
01:03:34,917 --> 01:03:36,646
Come on.

837
01:03:36,853 --> 01:03:38,946
-Come on.
-I can't.

838
01:03:39,155 --> 01:03:42,181
-Wait. I got an idea, I got an idea.
-What?

839
01:03:43,026 --> 01:03:44,687
Well, you know...

840
01:03:44,894 --> 01:03:47,590
...I used to steal cars.
I could hot-wire this bitch.

841
01:03:47,797 --> 01:03:49,128
Man, hurry up, will you?

842
01:03:51,234 --> 01:03:53,498
So tell me your charge.

843
01:03:53,703 --> 01:03:56,934
-I'll tell you mine.
-I don't really care.

844
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:59,438
Breaking and entering, huh?

845
01:04:00,343 --> 01:04:03,540
-What, you hit the White House?
-Man, hurry up!

846
01:04:03,746 --> 01:04:05,145
I'm not doing shit.

847
01:04:08,418 --> 01:04:10,477
What you in here for?

848
01:04:11,854 --> 01:04:15,346
-I'm in here for nothing.
-Man, that's what they all say, man.

849
01:04:16,826 --> 01:04:20,193
Okay, a friend of mine knocked off
an armored car.

850
01:04:20,396 --> 01:04:22,387
I should have known about it,
but I didn't.

851
01:04:22,598 --> 01:04:24,862
Cops found him at my house
with a bag full of cash.

852
01:04:25,101 --> 01:04:27,194
-Bag full of cash?
-Yeah.

853
01:04:27,403 --> 01:04:31,567
He implicated me, knocked
a couple of years off his sentence.

854
01:04:32,542 --> 01:04:34,976
I got five years.

855
01:04:35,511 --> 01:04:37,240
I lost my wife.

856
01:04:37,447 --> 01:04:40,348
She took my little girl away from me.

857
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:42,313
She's the only thing I ever loved.

858
01:04:43,453 --> 01:04:45,512
Everybody else....

859
01:04:45,722 --> 01:04:48,350
Everybody else has shit on me.

860
01:04:48,991 --> 01:04:51,323
I got burnt before too, Burke.

861
01:04:53,763 --> 01:04:55,594
I'd never burn you, homey.

862
01:04:56,065 --> 01:04:57,293
Yeah, we'll see.

863
01:04:59,435 --> 01:05:02,063
-Get that motherfucker. Come on.
-Oh, shit.

864
01:05:13,816 --> 01:05:15,511
Come on, Burke.

865
01:05:21,057 --> 01:05:23,855
Fuck you, Burke. You're a dead man.

866
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,890
-Yo, dog, this way.
-All right, all right.

867
01:05:29,465 --> 01:05:30,955
Ready?

868
01:05:31,734 --> 01:05:34,862
-Let's go, let's go.
-Let's go. Move it out.

869
01:05:36,939 --> 01:05:38,770
Total lockdown.

870
01:05:40,176 --> 01:05:42,804
Let's put this all back together, now.

871
01:05:48,818 --> 01:05:50,376
Get ready for anything.

872
01:05:51,788 --> 01:05:54,951
Half the cellblocks are under control.
It's a matter of time for the rest.

873
01:05:55,158 --> 01:05:58,958
Still no Cortez. This is a prison.
How many places can he hide?

874
01:05:59,162 --> 01:06:00,789
How does he think he's gonna get out?

875
01:06:22,885 --> 01:06:24,978
-Glad you could make it, sir.
-What's the status?

876
01:06:25,188 --> 01:06:26,587
Afraid things have gotten worse.

877
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:30,452
Inmate Alex Cortez has captured
two civilian hostages.

878
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,560
-Both females.
-Christ.

879
01:06:32,762 --> 01:06:34,559
Wallace, how could this happen?

880
01:06:34,764 --> 01:06:37,255
Governor, the riot began
just after visitation...

881
01:06:37,466 --> 01:06:40,162
...and one of the hostages
was in the conjugal room.

882
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:43,861
All right, let's get in there.
I wanna talk to this Cortez.

883
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:54,678
Burke locked us up.
He's a dead man.

884
01:06:54,884 --> 01:06:59,048
Hey, you do this thing,
you're gonna get out of here. Soon.

885
01:06:59,255 --> 01:07:00,779
Got it?

886
01:07:04,193 --> 01:07:06,991
This place is falling apart, man.

887
01:07:07,363 --> 01:07:10,821
-Oh, shit.
-Burke, I've been looking for you.

888
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,765
Check it out, man.

889
01:07:12,969 --> 01:07:13,936
Where's Cortez?

890
01:07:14,136 --> 01:07:17,071
You just follow me. I know
where that motherfucker Cortez is, bro.

891
01:07:17,273 --> 01:07:18,763
-Come on.
-I don't like this.

892
01:07:18,975 --> 01:07:20,806
This runs below the cellblock.

893
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:23,501
-It ends at the machine shop.
-That's where Cortez is?

894
01:07:23,713 --> 01:07:26,944
That's right, the motherfucker.
He knew about this shit all along.

895
01:07:27,149 --> 01:07:29,049
Just around here.

896
01:07:29,685 --> 01:07:31,243
Shit.

897
01:07:31,654 --> 01:07:35,852
-Where are you leading us, man?
-I told you, Cortez. Relax, man.

898
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:38,683
Why are you telling us this?

899
01:07:38,895 --> 01:07:42,353
I was supposed to break out with this
motherfucking bitch. He betrayed me.

900
01:07:42,565 --> 01:07:44,931
And I want some
motherfucking payback.

901
01:07:45,134 --> 01:07:46,431
l could use your help.

902
01:07:47,036 --> 01:07:50,005
Listen, I don't give a shit
about payback.

903
01:07:50,206 --> 01:07:52,333
I just wanna find my daughter.

904
01:07:54,977 --> 01:07:56,569
Man, I don't like this.

905
01:07:56,812 --> 01:07:59,212
I don't like this. How come
nobody else know about this?

906
01:07:59,415 --> 01:08:01,747
A cop will sell any information
for a price.

907
01:08:02,351 --> 01:08:03,784
Hey!

908
01:08:04,487 --> 01:08:07,354
Rivera! Fuck.

909
01:08:08,624 --> 01:08:12,526
What the fuck? I knew we
couldn't trust this fucking guy.

910
01:08:14,897 --> 01:08:19,459
You know what? You tell the warden
when this is all over, he'll pay.

911
01:08:19,669 --> 01:08:23,298
When I get my hands on Cortez,
I'm gonna snap his fucking neck.

912
01:08:26,375 --> 01:08:28,240
Gotta be another way.

913
01:08:55,705 --> 01:08:56,672
Oh, shit.

914
01:09:58,901 --> 01:10:00,562
I didn't do nothing.

915
01:10:01,504 --> 01:10:03,495
-Let's go, come on.
-Twitch.

916
01:10:08,611 --> 01:10:09,703
Better come.

917
01:10:38,307 --> 01:10:40,207
Look, I want some answers
and I want them now.

918
01:10:40,409 --> 01:10:42,036
And this time, I want the truth.

919
01:10:42,244 --> 01:10:45,236
-About what?
-Why your ass got transferred here.

920
01:10:45,448 --> 01:10:47,575
I already told you why.

921
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:50,245
All right, fuck it, man.

922
01:10:54,056 --> 01:10:56,217
I ain't gonna find it anyway.

923
01:10:56,425 --> 01:10:58,859
-Find what?
-The gold.

924
01:10:59,061 --> 01:11:00,551
Let me get this straight.

925
01:11:00,763 --> 01:11:04,324
You got transferred here so you could
break out and find some gold?

926
01:11:04,533 --> 01:11:08,936
-$ 160 million worth.
-Bullshit.

927
01:11:09,138 --> 01:11:11,538
All right. I know you never heard
of Lester McKenna.

928
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:14,573
<i>United States Supreme Court
Justice Jane McPherson...</i>

929
01:11:14,777 --> 01:11:16,574
<i>...just landed at New Alcatraz.</i>

930
01:11:16,779 --> 01:11:19,839
<i>She's here to witness
the execution of Lester McKenna.</i>

931
01:11:20,049 --> 01:11:23,075
He was my cellie at the Rock, okay?

932
01:11:23,285 --> 01:11:26,220
He done hit the government
for a shitload of cash, you understand?

933
01:11:26,422 --> 01:11:27,582
Gold bricks.

934
01:11:28,057 --> 01:11:30,150
<i>McPherson is the judge
who sentenced McKenna...</i>

935
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:34,819
<i>...in the now infamous heist of almost
$200 million in U.S. gold brick.</i>

936
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:37,863
They found one piece of it,
but he stashed another piece, okay?

937
01:11:38,067 --> 01:11:40,331
And only two people know about it,
me and Hubert...

938
01:11:40,536 --> 01:11:42,094
...who's also on the Rock.

939
01:11:42,838 --> 01:11:45,432
I'm out in a month. Mark your calendar.

940
01:11:45,941 --> 01:11:47,670
Feds have been coming around
all week...

941
01:11:47,877 --> 01:11:51,005
...promising me serenity
if I tell them where I hid it.

942
01:11:51,213 --> 01:11:53,909
<i>In a bizarre twist,
McKenna was able to stash the gold...</i>

943
01:11:54,116 --> 01:11:55,310
<i>...before he was apprehended.</i>

944
01:11:55,518 --> 01:11:58,214
<i>And he vowed never to divulge
its whereabouts.</i>

945
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:01,548
<i>This is what led to the nationwide
treasure hunt by the FBI...</i>

946
01:12:01,757 --> 01:12:03,918
<i>...that's gone on for 17 years.</i>

947
01:12:04,126 --> 01:12:08,460
<i>Now it's looking like McKenna
just might take his secret to the grave.</i>

948
01:12:08,664 --> 01:12:11,633
<i>Reporting live from Pier 39
on Fisherman's Wharf...</i>

949
01:12:11,834 --> 01:12:14,735
<i>...I'm Roxanne Long
from San Francisco.</i>

950
01:12:14,937 --> 01:12:17,804
That crazy motherfucker made sure
nobody else could find it.

951
01:12:27,249 --> 01:12:29,342
-Where is it?
-I ain't gonna tell you.

952
01:12:29,552 --> 01:12:31,179
I didn't say I wanted your gold.

953
01:12:31,387 --> 01:12:33,514
Oh, fuck off, Burke.
You're not so noble to where...

954
01:12:33,722 --> 01:12:35,019
...you don't wanna get no money.

955
01:12:35,591 --> 01:12:39,391
Shit, I been without it so long
that if I had it, I'd appreciate it.

956
01:12:39,595 --> 01:12:41,927
Look, neither one of us
are on death row.

957
01:12:42,131 --> 01:12:44,895
So we'll get our asses out of here
and we'll find it.

958
01:12:45,267 --> 01:12:49,795
Wait, wait, wait.
I got an idea, man.

959
01:12:51,273 --> 01:12:53,173
You know what?
I think I know where Cortez is.

960
01:12:55,544 --> 01:12:57,978
Cortez is on line one.

961
01:12:59,481 --> 01:13:01,039
<i>Hey, Wallace. Is the governor there?</i>

962
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:03,844
<i>-I'm here.
-Glad you could make it.</i>

963
01:13:04,053 --> 01:13:07,420
-Let me speak to the hostages.
-I don't think so.

964
01:13:07,623 --> 01:13:09,591
How do I know
you haven't harmed any of them?

965
01:13:09,792 --> 01:13:13,023
Trust me, governor.
Did you bring the helicopter?

966
01:13:13,429 --> 01:13:16,762
Yeah. Listen, about that.
We're trying to bring one in now.

967
01:13:16,966 --> 01:13:20,163
Bullshit.
I'm taking the one you brought.

968
01:13:20,369 --> 01:13:22,633
Have it in the rec yard in 10 minutes.

969
01:13:22,838 --> 01:13:24,999
And no games.

970
01:13:25,207 --> 01:13:28,108
By now I think you know
what I'm capable of.

971
01:13:28,744 --> 01:13:31,110
What's the ETA
on the hostage negotiator?

972
01:13:31,313 --> 01:13:33,907
Forget that.
Cortez is done negotiating.

973
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:36,275
Give him the helicopter. For now.

974
01:13:36,485 --> 01:13:38,885
Wait a minute. That's a murderer
you're setting loose.

975
01:13:39,088 --> 01:13:41,249
If you got a better idea,
I'd certainly like to hear it.

976
01:13:41,457 --> 01:13:44,153
Let's at least keep the lines
of communication with him open.

977
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:48,057
Time is running out and I want
those hostages out of there.

978
01:13:48,264 --> 01:13:50,562
We don't even know
where Cortez is holding them.

979
01:13:50,766 --> 01:13:53,633
Try looking at your monitors.
Who are those guys?

980
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:01,398
That's inmate Burke
and that New Alcatraz transfer.

981
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:04,170
The girl is Burke's daughter.

982
01:14:04,813 --> 01:14:07,805
And the woman
is the other inmate's fiancé.

983
01:14:08,884 --> 01:14:13,014
-Looks like they're trying to find them.
-Those two?

984
01:14:13,222 --> 01:14:16,714
-They're heading towards the annex.
-Annex?

985
01:14:16,925 --> 01:14:19,621
I need ten officers
to come with me right away.

986
01:14:19,828 --> 01:14:22,353
And bring armor.

987
01:14:22,564 --> 01:14:23,929
What's the annex?

988
01:14:26,135 --> 01:14:27,727
Death row.

989
01:14:39,481 --> 01:14:41,642
-Sometimes you gotta use your brain.
-Okay.

990
01:14:44,019 --> 01:14:45,611
Yes, we are in the game. Move.

991
01:14:45,821 --> 01:14:47,686
Okay. Let's do this.

992
01:15:05,908 --> 01:15:07,000
-Bernard.
-Dad.

993
01:15:07,209 --> 01:15:08,369
-Ellie.
-Keep cool.

994
01:15:08,577 --> 01:15:11,307
What the fuck is going on?

995
01:15:12,715 --> 01:15:15,081
That's your daughter?

996
01:15:19,154 --> 01:15:20,143
And this is your bitch?

997
01:15:20,356 --> 01:15:22,517
Oh, come on, Cortez.
Man, don't do that.

998
01:15:22,825 --> 01:15:25,988
-Let them go, Cortez.
-Who the fuck do you think you are?

999
01:15:26,462 --> 01:15:29,590
Get out of the doorway.
These two are my ticket out of here.

1000
01:15:29,798 --> 01:15:32,232
There's another way out.
Take it before it's too late.

1001
01:15:32,601 --> 01:15:33,932
You better back off.

1002
01:15:34,503 --> 01:15:35,765
Then shoot me.

1003
01:15:35,971 --> 01:15:37,199
Dad.

1004
01:15:37,406 --> 01:15:39,271
It's all right, Ellie.

1005
01:15:42,644 --> 01:15:46,808
You step one more foot,
I'm gonna blow her face off.

1006
01:15:48,217 --> 01:15:51,550
Look. If you want a hostage,
you take me.

1007
01:15:51,754 --> 01:15:54,450
-What, are you kidding?
-I got value, man.

1008
01:15:54,656 --> 01:15:55,782
You got nothing.

1009
01:15:56,258 --> 01:16:00,092
You got a hot bitch
and she's mine now.

1010
01:16:00,295 --> 01:16:02,456
I know where 160 million is stashed.

1011
01:16:02,664 --> 01:16:04,097
Now you let the ladies go...

1012
01:16:04,299 --> 01:16:07,029
-...and I'll cut you in.
-Don't play me.

1013
01:16:07,236 --> 01:16:08,396
I'm not trying to play you.

1014
01:16:08,604 --> 01:16:11,437
I'll tell you where it is,
I'll draw you a map. Come on, man.

1015
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,971
You're an inmate.

1016
01:16:13,175 --> 01:16:15,643
I don't believe a goddamn thing
you're saying.

1017
01:16:16,545 --> 01:16:19,708
And as a hostage you're useless.
I tell you what.

1018
01:16:19,915 --> 01:16:22,975
When I get out of here,
I'll think about setting them free.

1019
01:16:23,185 --> 01:16:26,677
Now, both of you,
get the fuck out of my way.

1020
01:16:27,122 --> 01:16:30,990
-I can't let you do that, Cortez.
-Oh, you can and you will.

1021
01:16:32,194 --> 01:16:33,889
Dad! Dad!

1022
01:16:35,364 --> 01:16:37,730
Why, you motherfucker--

1023
01:16:47,042 --> 01:16:48,009
Move!

1024
01:16:54,116 --> 01:16:56,641
Go, go, go.

1025
01:17:11,767 --> 01:17:13,667
Move.

1026
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,981
-Cortez!
-Dad! Dad!

1027
01:17:34,189 --> 01:17:35,315
Shut up!

1028
01:18:29,311 --> 01:18:30,369
Dad!

1029
01:18:47,729 --> 01:18:49,890
Sorry about your dad.

1030
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:57,365
You ain't going nowhere, fool.

1031
01:18:57,573 --> 01:18:59,837
-Fucker, get out of my way.
-Get your ass in there.

1032
01:19:00,042 --> 01:19:01,031
-Fuck.
-Get your ass in--

1033
01:19:01,243 --> 01:19:02,210
What?

1034
01:19:02,411 --> 01:19:04,208
Wanna throw people
through windows?

1035
01:19:04,413 --> 01:19:07,746
-Get your ass that way. Go.
-Fuck.

1036
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:09,417
I should pop you right now.

1037
01:19:09,618 --> 01:19:12,951
No, I should whoop your ass first,
then pop it.

1038
01:19:13,155 --> 01:19:14,247
Bernard.

1039
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,927
Dad, stop. You're gonna kill him.

1040
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:03,360
Dad.

1041
01:20:06,174 --> 01:20:08,142
-Are you okay, baby?
-Yeah.

1042
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:10,535
-Let's go, let's go.
-Come on.

1043
01:20:11,413 --> 01:20:14,905
-You all right, man?
-I'm alive, dude.

1044
01:20:15,117 --> 01:20:18,052
Eric, you guys get Cortez inside
right now.

1045
01:20:24,393 --> 01:20:25,360
Everything okay?

1046
01:20:27,963 --> 01:20:31,831
I ought to throw you two guys
in solitary, pulling a stunt like that.

1047
01:20:32,134 --> 01:20:36,036
Burke, Twitch, let's go.

1048
01:20:36,838 --> 01:20:38,897
-Let's go inside.
-Dad.

1049
01:20:40,442 --> 01:20:42,467
It's gonna be all right, baby.

1050
01:20:42,678 --> 01:20:45,169
-I love you.
-I love you.

1051
01:20:47,416 --> 01:20:49,907
I'm getting out soon, now, you hear?

1052
01:20:50,952 --> 01:20:53,352
-You wait for me, now.
-I always do.

1053
01:20:55,424 --> 01:20:56,948
Let's go.

1054
01:21:02,864 --> 01:21:04,263
Let's go.

1055
01:21:08,437 --> 01:21:12,100
And every word of it's true. I swear.

1056
01:21:12,307 --> 01:21:14,104
Just ask the warden.

1057
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:20,971
I can verify that Bernard Washington
did in fact try to defuse the riot...

1058
01:21:21,183 --> 01:21:25,449
...and is one of two men responsible
for the rescue of the hostages.

1059
01:21:25,654 --> 01:21:27,622
The other one was Burke.

1060
01:21:27,823 --> 01:21:29,620
He helped with the saving thing too.

1061
01:21:29,825 --> 01:21:33,090
I remind you again that this is
your parole hearing, not Mr. Burke's.

1062
01:21:33,295 --> 01:21:35,263
I know. I just wanted
to put that on record.

1063
01:21:35,464 --> 01:21:39,366
For when it's his turn
to spin that parole wheel.

1064
01:21:39,568 --> 01:21:41,229
You sure about what you saw?

1065
01:21:44,673 --> 01:21:47,039
Well, we've heard the account
of your supposed bravery...

1066
01:21:47,242 --> 01:21:48,300
...from Warden Wallace.

1067
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:50,034
And we've taken
into consideration...

1068
01:21:50,245 --> 01:21:52,270
...the years you've served
in New Alcatraz.

1069
01:21:52,481 --> 01:21:56,542
Except for a few minor infractions.

1070
01:21:57,452 --> 01:22:00,546
And we hereby grant you your parole.

1071
01:22:03,859 --> 01:22:05,827
Are you serious?

1072
01:22:07,395 --> 01:22:10,626
Thank you. Thank you.

1073
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:20,370
Thank you, thank you.

1074
01:22:20,575 --> 01:22:22,133
-Congratulations, Twitch.
-Thank you.

1075
01:22:22,344 --> 01:22:24,835
-Good luck, man.
-Yeah.

1076
01:22:25,313 --> 01:22:27,213
Now keep that nose clean.

1077
01:22:27,415 --> 01:22:29,645
Ain't got to worry about me.

1078
01:22:31,219 --> 01:22:33,710
Bernard. Bernard!

1079
01:22:36,691 --> 01:22:39,023
Okay. I mean, come on.

1080
01:22:39,227 --> 01:22:41,661
Really, I ain't got no time for games.
What's up?

1081
01:22:41,863 --> 01:22:43,763
-Where is it?
-Just--

1082
01:22:43,965 --> 01:22:46,058
I see that big old box,
where is the gold?

1083
01:22:46,268 --> 01:22:48,395
-I don't see it.
-Shut up and just help me.

1084
01:22:48,603 --> 01:22:50,798
Help you? You big enough
to help yourself.

1085
01:22:51,006 --> 01:22:52,439
Just grab it. Ready?

1086
01:22:52,641 --> 01:22:55,041
Here we go.

1087
01:22:57,212 --> 01:22:59,442
-Oh, my God.
-Shit.

1088
01:22:59,648 --> 01:23:01,980
-Baby. Is it--?
-Shit.

1089
01:23:02,184 --> 01:23:06,211
It's gold. It's really here, baby.

1090
01:23:07,122 --> 01:23:09,215
You did it. Baby.

1091
01:23:09,424 --> 01:23:12,723
I can't believe it. You did it.

1092
01:23:14,563 --> 01:23:16,531
Twitch.

1093
01:23:19,534 --> 01:23:21,729
Twitch.

1094
01:23:27,809 --> 01:23:31,142
-We rich, baby.
-We rich. We rich.

1095
01:23:33,215 --> 01:23:36,844
-What?
-We better get this out of here quick.

1096
01:23:37,219 --> 01:23:39,153
-Look at this.
-Let me count my money.

1097
01:23:39,921 --> 01:23:42,253
-Oh, it's your money, Bernard?
-Yeah, it's my money.

1098
01:23:42,457 --> 01:23:43,754
That's what I'm talking about.

1099
01:23:43,959 --> 01:23:45,927
Just bring the money to the car.
Hurry up.

1100
01:23:46,127 --> 01:23:48,891
-You wouldn't help me dig, wouldn't--
-I ain't helping nothing.

1101
01:23:49,097 --> 01:23:51,429
When you was in the jail,
you was crying like girl.

1102
01:23:51,633 --> 01:23:53,567
I risked my life for you
and you wouldn't help.

1103
01:23:53,768 --> 01:23:54,996
Help me get this out of here.

1104
01:23:55,203 --> 01:23:57,068
Get your ass back here.

1105
01:24:01,376 --> 01:24:04,106
-Dude, you look tight.
-Thanks, this is my Snoop Dogg look.

1106
01:24:04,312 --> 01:24:07,213
I'm gonna tell you something.
You put this in your pocket, right?

1107
01:24:07,415 --> 01:24:09,645
Don't give it to your ma or pa
and don't buy no drugs.

1108
01:24:09,851 --> 01:24:12,684
You'll be all right. Go on, now.
You enjoy yourself, boy.

1109
01:24:12,888 --> 01:24:14,583
-Hey.
-Hey, Twitch. Hey, Cherise.

1110
01:24:14,789 --> 01:24:16,347
Hey, Burke.

1111
01:24:16,558 --> 01:24:18,048
What's up?

1112
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,524
Same old, man. How about you?

1113
01:24:20,929 --> 01:24:23,591
You don't notice nothing different
about your boy?

1114
01:24:23,798 --> 01:24:25,459
You know, come to think of it...

1115
01:24:25,667 --> 01:24:28,363
...you are a hell of a lot uglier.

1116
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:31,332
-Not funny. What you laughing at?
-Very funny.

1117
01:24:31,539 --> 01:24:34,975
If 80 million will make you this ugly,
you need a facelift.

1118
01:24:35,176 --> 01:24:37,201
-Only 80?
-Well, actually it was more.

1119
01:24:37,412 --> 01:24:39,346
We put the other 80
into a separate account.

1120
01:24:39,547 --> 01:24:41,845
-For you.
-Eighty million?

1121
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:45,884
-Well, shit. It wasn't my idea.
-Yes, it was. Stop lying.

1122
01:24:46,087 --> 01:24:48,612
Eighty million dollars?

1123
01:24:48,823 --> 01:24:51,348
You gotta keep that on the low,
they might think I stole it.

1124
01:24:51,559 --> 01:24:53,117
Keep it on the low.

1125
01:24:53,328 --> 01:24:56,126
-I don't know what to say, guys.
-We owed you, Burke.

1126
01:24:56,331 --> 01:24:58,196
You make sure you push
some of that up, now.

1127
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:02,131
You got that beautiful little daughter
of yours. Now, college is a killer.

1128
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:05,268
Don't you worry, guys. I will.

1129
01:25:05,473 --> 01:25:08,965
-You gonna be okay in here?
-I'm gonna be just fine, darling.

1130
01:25:09,177 --> 01:25:10,610
He transferred Cortez.

1131
01:25:12,547 --> 01:25:15,107
See, that's what that boy get.
Something was wrong with him.

1132
01:25:15,317 --> 01:25:17,217
He had a real serious problem,
you know?

1133
01:25:17,419 --> 01:25:19,284
But check this out, I had an idea.

1134
01:25:19,487 --> 01:25:21,421
How would you like it
if I got your daughter...

1135
01:25:21,656 --> 01:25:23,521
...and brought her to you
for Christmas?

1136
01:25:23,725 --> 01:25:26,819
-Bernard.
-You guys don't have to do that, now.

1137
01:25:27,028 --> 01:25:28,086
Oh, that's not far at all.

1138
01:25:28,296 --> 01:25:30,355
Missouri is a hop,
skip and a jump away...

1139
01:25:30,565 --> 01:25:32,465
...when you're in first class.

1140
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:35,932
Now, you know we supposed
to go see Mama for Christmas.

1141
01:25:36,137 --> 01:25:39,834
Like I said, it sounds like a great idea
to come here for Christmas.

1142
01:25:40,041 --> 01:25:42,032
Oh, don't you disrespect
my mama like that.

1143
01:25:42,243 --> 01:25:46,543
I said we gonna take his daughter here
to see him, that's what we're gonna do.

1144
01:25:46,748 --> 01:25:48,773
No, we not.
Not on no Christmas, we ain't.

1145
01:25:48,984 --> 01:25:51,077
I don't know who you think you are.
Stop calling--

1146
01:25:51,286 --> 01:25:53,618
How many times I gotta tell you
to stop calling me ''woman''?

1147
01:25:53,822 --> 01:25:55,187
-You all high and mighty.
-What's your problem?

1148
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:57,381
You ain't got no bling like me.
You been trouble.

1149
01:25:57,592 --> 01:25:59,719
-You should've never called me.
-I should've never called.

1150
01:25:59,928 --> 01:26:01,520
Ever since you put on this little hat--

1151
01:26:01,730 --> 01:26:02,924
-Anyway, Burke.
-We're going--

1152
01:26:03,131 --> 01:26:05,065
You don't talk to me like that.

1153
01:26:05,266 --> 01:26:07,860
Man, I don't wanna talk to you.
You ain't got no say in this.

1154
01:26:08,069 --> 01:26:10,537
-I know--
-Whatever. Whatever.
