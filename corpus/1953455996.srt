and the 10's in thirds

190
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,962
and I didn't fold
the singles.

191
00:14:57,964 --> 00:14:59,998
Coins are easy because
they're different sizes.

192
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,633
You're amazing,
thank you.

193
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,101
Oh, no problem.

194
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,203
You'll get used to
a cash-free life.

195
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,471
It just makes things
easier.

196
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,039
Right.

197
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,508
Well, I'll see you
tomorrow.

198
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,344
You want to stay a little while
off the clock?

199
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,620
Oh, I'm sorry. You probably
have plans or a girlfriend.

200
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,322
I didn't mean to cross
any boundaries.

201
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,958
No, no, no girlfriend.

202
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,027
No place to be.

203
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,629
I'm not prying.

204
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,064
I know.

205
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,499
I'm just--

206
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:37,602
pretty shy person,
I'm sure you've seen that.

207
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,937
Yeah.

208
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:41,005
You're really talented.

209
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,042
Thanks.

210
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,209
You can still--

211
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,278
No, I don't think so.
Those days are over.

212
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:49,514
"Jeff" short for--

213
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,382
Jeffrey.

214
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,018
Jeffrey, I like that.
Can I call you "Jeffrey"?

215
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,987
Okay.

216
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:57,555
I don't know what
you look like.

217
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,589
Do you mind?

218
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,657
Sure.

219
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,330
(Chuckling)

220
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,168
Are you blushing,
Jeffrey?

221
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,740
Yeah, I could
feel that.

222
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,314
You're handsome.

223
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,321
I really should
get going.

224
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,490
Oh-- right.

225
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,558
Yeah, wait,
I'll uh--

226
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,626
I'll walk you to the--
to the door.

227
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,366
I don't think I'll
ever get used to this.

228
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,001
Sure you will.

229
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,502
It'll take a little time
and it won't be easy,

230
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,770
but you will.

231
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:56,047

232
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,444
(Knocking at door)

233
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,513
It's open!

234
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,253
Jeff?

235
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,255
You shouldn't do that.

236
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,756
Shouldn't do what?

237
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,224
Leave the door unlocked

238
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,692
and tell someone
to come in.

239
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,194
I was expecting you.

240
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,595
Besides, you have a key.

241
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,365
For emergencies.

242
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,733
You're starting to
get around pretty well,

243
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,668

blind.

You want a cup

No, I don't want
a cup of coffee.

00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,741
I know you're right.

252
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:37,215
But it's just not the way
I want to live my life.

253
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,187
It's not me.

254

Hello?

Jeffrey?

00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,538
Hello, Ali Lear.

260
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,674
Ali, good morning.

261
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,943
Dr. Weinette,
how are you?

262
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,945
I should be asking you that.

263
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:02,813
Well, I'm good.

264
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:04,682
Oh, well,
I'm glad to hear that.

265
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:06,450
<i>I was planning on</i>
<i>dropping by</i>

266
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,686
in a few days and checking in
on you in person.

267
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:10,955
You should come by, Doctor.
I would love to see you.

268
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:12,056
I will.

269
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,924
Okay, looking forward
to it.

270
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,893
Me too.
See you soon.

271
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:16,894
Bye.

272
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,896
(Knocking at door)

273
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,965
Just a minute!

274
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,139
Ow!

275
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:30,574
(Sighing)

276
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:31,575
Hi.

277
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,676
Good morning.

278
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,579
Ow.

279
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,781
What's the matter?

280
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,582
Oh, I just hit my leg
on the table.

281
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,050
I missed my spot.

282
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,723
Bagels? I smelled them
before I opened the door.

283
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:48,492
Your senses are increasing.
That's good.

284
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,094
Is it my turn to make
the coffee?

285
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,730
Yep. After breakfast,
I'm going to go to the market.

286
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,498
I want to come!

287
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,935
On course.

288
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,070
Okay, now you're about--

289
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:04,508
10 yards away
from the curb.

290
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,777
Slow.

291
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,646
You can hear the traffic
a little bit.

292
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,514
A little bit more
to your right.

293
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:13,083
That's the cross
signal button.

294
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:15,786
Go over and push it.

295
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,889
There it is.

296
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,192
Now, listen for
the signal.

Okay, here goes.

302
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,222
Okay, there you go.

303
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,963
Oh!

304
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:01,098
That was a huge
leap of faith.

305
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,167
You did great.

Hello.

315
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,762
I'm Linda, your
new neighbour.

316
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:34,231
Your only neighbour,
from the looks of things.

317

Oh, right. The girl
we saw the other day.

318
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,636
I was just moving in.

319
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:44,708
Well, it's nice
to meet you.

320
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,210
I'm Ali and this is
my aid, Jeffrey.

321
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,545
Hi.

322
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,713
I'm sorry, I didn't
even realize--

323
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,849
Don't apologize, please.
It's embarrassing.

324
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,985
Well, it's nice to
officially meet you both.

325
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,954
I was feeling kind of lonely

326
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:58,622
across the street
all by myself.

327
00:25:58,624 --> 00:25:59,990
Well, come by
any time!

328
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,959
Really?
Yeah.

329
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:03,661
Let me-- let me
show you something.

330
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,195
They have the best
incense over here.

331
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,797
Can I-- do you
want to go with me?

332
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,799
ALI:
Yeah, sure, sure!

333
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:09,867
How long have you
lived here?

334
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,569
Oh, a long time.
Seven years.

00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:12,570

Oh, wow!

Oh, I can't wait to learn
the neighbourhood.

338
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,878
I'm going to make you
dinner.

339
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,147
Okay, great.

340
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:26,350
It'll be nice to have
a friend nearby.

341
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,586
What does she
look like?

342
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,588
I don't know--

343
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,723
brown hair.

344
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:34,658
I think she liked you.

345
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,060
Why would you
say that?

346
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:37,795
'Cause she perked up when
she heard you were my aid.

347
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:39,363
I guess she thought
we were a couple.

is open.

00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:47,905
Yeah, I thought I heard
something there this morning.

351
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:49,073
It was just my imagination.

352
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:50,307
Want me to close it?

353
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,776
Doesn't matter.

354
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:55,779
Well, you asked me
not to go in there.

355
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,314
Well, that was before
I knew you.

356
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:59,383
Go ahead,
look around.

357
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,739
JEFF:
Your work is really inspiring.

358
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,841
Thank you.

359
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:26,910
You know, you could still
do those things.

360
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:29,813
No.

361
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,849
At least the sculpting.

362
00:27:31,851 --> 00:27:34,218
You're always saying you have
nothing but time on your hands.

363
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,254
I'm not ready yet.

364
00:27:37,256 --> 00:27:40,791
Maybe you could
teach me?

365
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,393
(Chuckling)

366
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:43,861
Come on.

367
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:45,729
I don't know.

368
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:56,940
(Door buzzing)

369
00:27:56,942 --> 00:27:59,009
I'll get it.

370
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,084
Yes?

371
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,986
Hello, I'm looking for
Ali Lear.

372
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:10,988
Alejandra.
Yes.

373
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,322
And you are?

374
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,391
Alex Smith,
reporter with the Times.

375
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,793
No.

376
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,428
I'd just like to
speak with her.

377
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,297
Ms. Lear is in no condition
to speak to anyone.

378
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,398
You need to leave.

379
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,033
And who are you?

380
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,304
Who am I?
I'm her caretaker.

381
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,139
She relies on me
for everything.

382
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,774
She does not take a step
without me.

383
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,376
I am her eyes.

384
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,778
Now, Ms. Lear
wants her privacy.

385
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,413
Ms. Lear needs
her privacy

386
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:39,083
and you need to leave--
now!

387
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,767
Who was it?

388
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:57,901
No one.

389
00:28:57,903 --> 00:29:00,337
It was that reporter
looking for you.

390
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,872
Just relax.

391
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:03,941
It's just that
people like that--

392
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:08,178
they just piss me off.

393
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,453
You should be a chef.

394
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:19,523
I learned from
my mom.

395
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:22,192
She was a good cook,
it was her art.

396
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:24,161
My mother wasn't much
of a cook.

397
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:26,230
She wasn't really much of
a homemaker at all.

398
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,937
I should go.

399
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,477
I'll see you tomorrow.
I had a good time today.

400
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,079
Me, too.

401
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:43,147
Lock the door.

402
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:45,215
Yes, Jeffrey.

403
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,833
ALI:
Jeffrey, is that you?

404
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:04,134
Yeah.

405
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,203
We're having coffee.
Linda brought croissants.

406
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,040
Just a sec.

407
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,053
'Morning.
Hey there.

408
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,023
Hey, Jeffrey.

409
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,524
It's good to see you.
How are you doing?

410
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:30,561
Good, I'm good.
What's up?

411
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:31,829
Linda came by on her
way to work.

412
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:33,297
She has a great idea.

413
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:34,865
Oh, yeah? What's that?

414
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:40,971
(Music playing)

415
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:41,972
Bob!

416
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:43,173
Linda!
Hey!

417
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,008
What are you
doing here?

418
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,910
I thought you
graduated.

419
00:30:46,912 --> 00:30:48,579
Oh yes, I did.
Long ago.

420
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:50,280
I just wanted to show my friends
where I grew up.

421
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:51,615
Bob, this is Ali.
Hi.

422
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,884
And this is Jeff.

423
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:56,620
Hey, Jeff.
You got some ID?

424
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,168
Alright.

425
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,372
Cool, good seeing you!
Talk to you later.

426
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,041
Linda, what's his
problem?

427
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:19,910
No problem.
He's doing his job.

428
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:23,080
Why didn't he ask Ali
to see her ID?

429

Thank you for tonight.

00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,485
It was really fun.

447
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:36,653
It was a great idea.

448
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:39,623
Do you mind walking me

I'm the only one

I'll be right back.

456
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,276
So, did you
have fun tonight?

457
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,012
It was okay.

458
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,982
I was thinking, um,

459
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,985
maybe you and I could
go out sometime.

460
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:10,053
No, I don't think so.

461
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,692
Are you and Ali--

462
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,361
No.

463
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:19,129
But you like her?

464
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:21,565
Well, I guess she's
pretty enough, but--

465
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:24,468
it's just that I have
a girlfriend.

466
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,005
Oh.

467
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:30,073
I'm sorry.

468
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,512
(Keys jingling)

469
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,555
So?

470
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:48,625
So? Nothing.

471
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,293
To be honest,
it's empty.

472
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,195
I don't have anybody
to care about,

473
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,230
nobody to love.

474
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:54,731
I tried to warn you.

475
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,066
I know you did.

476
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:59,136
You were right about
something else, too.

477
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,737
Oh? And what is that?

478
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:02,539
Jeff.

479
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,074
He's been a big help.

480
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:06,076
Oh, great. You two
are getting along?

481
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:07,210
Mm-hmm.

482
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,578
Any problems?

483
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,780
Don't take this
the wrong way--

484
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:11,114
I don't know what
I'd do without him.

485
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:13,283
But?

486
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:16,253
But he's a little...

487
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:17,521
possessive.

488
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:19,456
Possessive? How?

489
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,291
Yeah, a friend came by
the other day

490
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,226
and it was--
I don't know, like,

491
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:24,594
like he was jealous.

492
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:26,630
(Chuckling)
A male friend?

493
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:28,365
Mm-mm.

494
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:31,201
Actually, a female friend
who's just

495
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:33,804
moved in across the street
in the neighbourhood.

496
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:35,272
She has a crush on him
and it makes him

497
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,374
I guess,
uncomfortable.

498
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:39,643
And he's just-- I don't think
it has anything to do with that

499
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:41,812
and I'm sure
it's nothing,

500
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:44,214
but it just was--
you know.

501
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:46,583
He can be an intense
young man.

502
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,584
Yeah, you think?

503
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:48,585
(Both chuckling)

504
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:52,189
(Door opening)

505
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:53,824
ALI:
Jeff, look who's here!

506
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,626
Hi, Doc.

507
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:58,361
Hey, Jeff.

508
00:34:58,363 --> 00:34:59,529
How are you?

509
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,098
Good, I'm good.
How are you?

510
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,566
I'm well, thank you.

511
00:35:02,568 --> 00:35:03,700
So, what brings you by?

512
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:06,670
Oh, I came by to see
my patient and you.

513
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:07,671
Oh?

514
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:09,239
To tell the truth,

515
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,208
I have to be going,
but I was stalling

516
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,709
hoping to see you.

517
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:14,144
Well, here I am.

518
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:15,745
I was telling Lisa how
good you've been to me.

519
00:35:15,747 --> 00:35:17,214
Really helpful.

520
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:18,748
No, honestly, Jeff,
she just told me

521
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,383
you were a natural
caregiver.

522
00:35:20,385 --> 00:35:22,786
You should really consider
a career in rehab.

523
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,387
We should talk about it.

524
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,223
I mean, Ali's not going to
need you forever.

525
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,559
Yeah, the good doctor has just
dropped by an application

526
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:31,828
to begin the process
to get a guide dog.

527
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,665
Really? You never mentioned
a dog before.

528
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,234
No, I really never
thought about it

529
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,703
but now that I do,
I think it's a great idea.

530
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:41,171
It's just--

531
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:44,407
it's just not as simple
as all that.

532
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:45,809
I know, but I think
it's a great idea

533
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:49,779
You're always worrying about me.
A dog could protect me.

534
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,817
Thank you for coming by.

535
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,919
Mm, it was my pleasure.
And like I said,

536
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,787
you and Jeff fill out
those forms

537
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,623
and then he can
drop it off at my office

538
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,324
and when you do,

539
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,261
we should talk about
your new calling.

540
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:06,396
Helping the blind.

541
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,465
Yes, of course.

542
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:19,276
♪

543
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,215
What are you hiding from
the blind lady?

544
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,485
Play your little game,

545
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:30,320
but you're going to have to
tell me after breakfast.

546
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:31,454
Alright.

547
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:32,923
Promise?

548
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:34,491
Promise.

549
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:36,560
(Chuckling)

550
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,204
Loosen it up.

551
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,776
Then you have to figure out
what you want to make.

552
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:53,910

553
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,780

00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:05,467
I'm not going to
rely on you.

738
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:09,605
What's the matter?

739
00:55:09,607 --> 00:55:11,674
Nothing.

740
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:19,782
What can I do?

741
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:22,851
Here, help me finish
the salad-- tear these up.

742
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,922
Did you know that she's
a graphic artist?

743
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:27,923
Who?

744
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:29,625
Linda.

745
00:55:29,627 --> 00:55:33,362
No.

746
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:35,030
Well, I invited her
to dinner on Sunday.

747
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:37,032
I thought it would
be nice.

748
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,400
I'm sure it will be.

749
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:40,035
Jeffrey, I'm not trying
to set you two up.

750
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:42,905
She's a friend,
she's alone like us.

751
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:45,474
You don't have to explain
yourself, Ali.

752
00:55:45,476 --> 00:55:46,942
Well, then let's
shop tomorrow.

753
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:53,082
(Knocking at door)

754
00:55:53,084 --> 00:55:55,351
ALI:
Would you?

755
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:56,819
Sure.

756
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,694
Hi!
Hi.

757
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:06,795
How are you?

758
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:08,364
Good, good.
How are you?

759
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:09,698
Good!

760
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,700
Thank you so much
for having me over.

761
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,036
I have been looking forward
to this all day.

762
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,938
Us, too.

763
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,673
Hi!
Hi!

764
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:19,575
How's it going?

765
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:22,044
Good. Oh, that smells
so good!

766
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:23,078
What is it?

767
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,014
It is sweet potato
casserole.

768
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:27,049
Do you want
a glass of wine?

769
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:29,051
Oh, I would love one,
thank you.

770
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:30,552
Can I help you?

771
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:31,954
Yeah.

772
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:33,989
What can I do?

773
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:35,791
It's a mess.

774
00:56:35,793 --> 00:56:38,861
(Linda and Ali chatting,
indistinct)

775
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:47,703
There's some potatoes.

776
00:56:47,705 --> 00:56:51,073
ALI:
No? Aww.

777
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,641
I tease.

778
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:54,109
I do, I do.

779
00:56:54,111 --> 00:56:56,645
ALI:
To friends.

780
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:57,980
JEFF:
To friends.
To friends.

781
00:56:57,982 --> 00:56:58,981
To friends.

782
00:56:58,983 --> 00:57:00,149
Thank you for
having me over.

783
00:57:00,151 --> 00:57:02,451
Aw, I'm so glad
you came.

784
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:03,519
Aren't you, Jeffrey?

785
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:05,120
Mm-hmm.

786
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:06,522
Thank you for cooking.

787
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:08,123
Yeah, no problem.

788
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:09,124
Anybody want
anything more?

789
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:13,195
(Crickets chirping)

790
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:16,131
(Chuckling)

791
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:18,567
Oh, my gosh.
Can I borrow your restroom?

792
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:19,701
I think I had
too much wine.

793
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:20,736
Mm-hmm.

794
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:21,737
Where is it?

795
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:22,938
Oh, it's right
back there.

796
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,007
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

797
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:28,444
(Sighing)
Wow.

798
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,818
Mmm.

799
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:38,520
(Door closing)

800
00:57:38,522 --> 00:57:41,190
That was good,
wasn't it?

801
00:57:41,192 --> 00:57:43,659
Mmm. Are you kidding?
It was great.

802
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:46,662
Yeah, it's nice having
someone over, isn't it?

803
00:57:46,664 --> 00:57:48,130
Of course it is.

804
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,199
Yeah.

805
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,164
Um, I'd better go.

806
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,533
I've had too much
wine.

807
00:58:24,535 --> 00:58:27,069
ALI:
Oh, me too.

808
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:28,937
I'm just gonna, um--
goodnight.

809
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:30,672
Oh, let me get
your dish!

810
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,074
I'll get it tomorrow.

811
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:34,643
ALI:
Okay.

812
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:36,178
Bye.

813
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,247
Thanks for coming.

814
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,688
(Chuckling)

815
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:54,997
Tired?

816
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:56,565
Don't worry,
I'll clean up.

817
00:58:56,567 --> 00:58:59,835
I won't argue
with that.

818
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:02,037
(Sighing)

819
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,138
Your head hurt?

820
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,240
Mm-hmm.

821
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:06,542
Alright, well,
you just get comfortable

822
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:07,743
and I'll get
your pill.

823
00:59:07,745 --> 00:59:09,144
Thanks.
Want some tea?

824
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:11,213
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

825
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:49,851
Here you go.
Here's your pill

826
00:59:49,853 --> 00:59:51,119
and here's your tea.

827
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:53,288
Hmm.

828
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:55,357
It smells good.

829
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:33,061
♪

830
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:05,360
LINDA:
Who is it?

831
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:07,429
Jeff. I brought
your dish over.

832
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:14,236
You didn't have to do that.

833
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:15,971
I could have gotten it
another time.

834
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:18,240
But I want to
talk to you, too.

835
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:20,242
About what?

836
01:01:20,244 --> 01:01:23,412
About earlier
this evening.

837
01:01:23,414 --> 01:01:27,716
Look, it's late and I've
got work in the morning

838
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:28,884
so, I just don't--

839
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:30,252
It'll just take
a minute.

840
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:46,134
Ah, I just really want to thank
you for coming over tonight.

841
01:01:46,136 --> 01:01:48,837
Ali's really happy.

842
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:50,372
And I want to thank you
for not saying anything

843
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:51,907
about the pictures.

844
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,742
What is going on
over there?

845
01:01:53,744 --> 01:01:57,179
Well, maybe Ali and I are

846
01:01:57,181 --> 01:01:58,413
more than friends now.

847
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:01,049
(Laughing)

848
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:03,085
No.
(Laughing)

849
01:02:03,087 --> 01:02:05,921
No, she would have
said something.

850
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,928
Why did you have to
come around?

851
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:14,296
Couldn't you just
leave us alone?

852
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:16,431
Look, I don't know what
you're doing to Ali,

853
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:18,800
but I'm going to put
an end to it!

854
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:21,036
Now, I want you out of here
before I call the police.

855
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,239
One--

856
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,108
Leave us alone.

857
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,109
Two--

858
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:30,445
Stay away!

859
01:02:30,447 --> 01:02:32,514
Three.

860
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:40,956
Leave--

861
01:02:40,958 --> 01:02:42,457
us--

862
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:43,492
alone!

863
01:02:43,494 --> 01:02:45,761
(Shattering)

864
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:19,988
Hey.

865
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:20,989
(Gasping)

866
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,024
You scared the hell
out of me.

867
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:26,127
Oh, I shouldn't have
taken a pill

868
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:28,396
after having so much
wine last night.

869
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:30,365
Is that coffee?

870
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,167
Uh-huh.

871
01:04:32,169 --> 01:04:33,168
Oh, good.

872
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:35,604
Do you remember going
to bed last night?

873
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:37,239
Uh, no.

874
01:04:37,241 --> 01:04:39,908
I had to wake you up
and send you upstairs.

875
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:41,977
Yeah, I don't remember
a thing.

876
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,649
Would you excuse me
for a second?

877
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:28,456
(Glass shattering)

878
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:30,058
You okay?

879
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,594
Yeah, I'm still
a little woozy.

880
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,596
JEFF:
What did you break?

881
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,665
I knocked a picture
off the wall.

882
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,706
Careful,
there's glass.

883
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,377
Something feels different
about this picture.

884
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:51,146
JEFF:
What do you mean?

885
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:52,647
It just doesn't
feel right.

886
01:05:52,649 --> 01:05:55,016
JEFF:
Let me see.

887
01:05:55,018 --> 01:05:57,085
Here.

888
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,491
Uh, looks like
the glass cut it.

889
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:06,261
Oh no,
which picture is it?

890
01:06:06,263 --> 01:06:09,731
It's of, uh, you and your
daughter and your husband.

891
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:14,369
Why don't I take it

892
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:16,237
and see what I can
do with it

893
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:17,539
and put some new
glass in here?

894
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:19,274
Let's get you
out of here.

895
01:06:19,276 --> 01:06:21,343
I'll come back
and clean it up.

896
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:06,721
What are you doing?

897
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:09,591
(Gasping)

898
01:07:09,593 --> 01:07:11,426
Uh, just

899
01:07:11,428 --> 01:07:13,495
playing around.

900
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:17,565
I thought we could go to
the nursery today.

901
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:18,733
Maybe Linda will
want to go.

902
01:07:18,735 --> 01:07:20,769
Is her car outside?

903
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:23,471
No.

904
01:07:23,473 --> 01:07:25,540
(Chimes jingling
softly)

905
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,165
ALI:
Is she back yet?

906
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:54,202
Uh, I don't know.

907
01:07:54,204 --> 01:07:56,271
Maybe she went on vacation
or something.

908
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,677
<i>Hi, it's Linda.</i>
<i>You know the drill!</i>

909
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:04,345
(Beeping)

910
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:05,647
Hi, Linda,
it's Ali again.

911
01:08:05,649 --> 01:08:07,715
Call me when you get in.

912
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:14,556
I wonder where
she is.

913
01:08:14,558 --> 01:08:16,858
I hope
everything's okay.

914
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:19,260
I'm sure it is.

915
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:22,397
I'm just a little worried.
It's been days.

916
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,865
I'll see you tomorrow.

917
01:08:23,867 --> 01:08:25,200
Already?

918
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:27,135
Yeah, I'm tired.

919
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:28,536
Okay. Goodnight.

920
01:08:28,538 --> 01:08:30,605
'Night.

921
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:33,842
(Sighing)

922
01:08:33,844 --> 01:08:38,113
(Ringing)

923
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,150
<i>Hi, it's Linda.</i>
<i>You know the drill!</i>

924
01:08:42,152 --> 01:08:44,219
(Beeping)

925
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,776
Linda?

926
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,827
Linda?

927
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,947
Oh my--

928
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:26,721
(Crying)

929
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,523
Oh, no!

930
01:10:28,525 --> 01:10:32,527
Oh, no!
(Crying)

931
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:35,597
(Crying)

932
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:44,339
(Sobbing)

933
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,583
(Siren wailing)

934
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:01,889
DETECTIVE:
I want you to canvass the area

935
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:03,524
three blocks in every
direction.

936
01:11:03,526 --> 01:11:05,293
Talk to anyone you see.

937
01:11:05,295 --> 01:11:06,861
Indigent, homeless--
I don't care.

938
01:11:06,863 --> 01:11:08,296
Every neighbour
in every building.

939
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:09,330
Check the roofs,

940
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:10,865
do not pollute
the crime scene.

941
01:11:10,867 --> 01:11:12,934
You know the drill.

942
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,538
Ali! What happened?

943
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:21,609
(Crying)

944
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,521
Were you attacked?

945
01:11:33,523 --> 01:11:35,290
Linda's dead.

946
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:37,325
What? How?

947
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:39,427
DETECTIVE:
She found the body.

948
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:41,596
What happened?

949
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:42,997
You're Jeffrey
McAuley?

950
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:43,998
Yes.

951
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,601
Detective Roy Archer.

952
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:49,370
I need to ask Ms. Lear
some questions.

953
01:11:49,372 --> 01:11:52,607
But she's pretty
distraught.

954
01:11:52,609 --> 01:11:55,710
She was asking for you,
so I just thought we'd wait.

955
01:11:55,712 --> 01:11:58,780
Thanks. She lives
right over here.

956
01:11:58,782 --> 01:11:59,881
If we could just--

957
01:11:59,883 --> 01:12:02,884
Sure.

958
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:04,952
(Crying)

959
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:13,027
So, the last time you saw
the deceased

960
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,495
was three nights ago.

961
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:15,496
Yes.

962
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:17,598
She came over for dinner.

963
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,568
And neither of you
are aware of any enemies

964
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:21,903
the deceased may have had--

965
01:12:21,905 --> 01:12:23,771
ex-boyfriends?

966
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:27,775
No. No enemies or exes
that I know of.

967
01:12:27,777 --> 01:12:29,510
But we didn't know her
very well.

968
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:30,511
Jeff!

969
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:31,813
Ali, we didn't.

970
01:12:31,815 --> 01:12:34,015
She moved in,
we met her.

971
01:12:34,017 --> 01:12:35,616
We hung out
a few times, but--

972
01:12:35,618 --> 01:12:37,485
that's all we really know.

973
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,656
You say she mentioned
being scared.

974
01:12:41,658 --> 01:12:43,758
She said that.

975
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,360
But I thought she was
just talking.

976
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:46,761
For attention,
you know.

977
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:47,762
Right.

978
01:12:47,764 --> 01:12:48,930
She was like that.

979
01:12:48,932 --> 01:12:50,898
So, you don't think
she had

980
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,433
any reason
to be scared?

981
01:12:52,435 --> 01:12:53,601
I don't know.

982
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:54,736
Not more than
anyone else.

983
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:56,537
The neighbourhood
is what it is.

984
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:01,376
Well, there were signs
of a burglary,

985
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:02,877
but no forced entry,

986
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:05,680
which means Miss Gamon
knew her assailant.

987
01:13:05,682 --> 01:13:07,548
Or at least let him in.

988
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,851
I don't want to speak
badly about anyone

989
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:12,787
but I think you should
consider the possibility

990
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:15,857
that she brought someone home.

991
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:17,792
A man, I mean.

992
01:13:17,794 --> 01:13:20,962
She-- she was
aggressive sexually.

993
01:13:20,964 --> 01:13:21,996
Jeff!

994
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:23,698
Ali--

995
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,433
you don't know and I didn't
want to say anything, but--

996
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:28,403
Did you see someone
or what?

997
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:30,405
No, no, nothing like that.

998
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:34,609
But she came on to me
pretty aggressively one night.

999
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:39,781
I just think
that maybe

1000
01:13:39,783 --> 01:13:41,883
you should consider
the possibility.

1001
01:13:41,885 --> 01:13:43,951
Maybe.

1002
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:46,454
Maybe.

1003
01:13:46,456 --> 01:13:48,689
Tell me,

1004
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:50,792
Mr. McAuley,

1005
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:53,828
when she came on to you,

1006
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:56,597
did you encourage her
in any way?

1007
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,666
No.

1008
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:04,872
Well, the murder weapon
appears to have been

1009
01:14:04,874 --> 01:14:06,974
a plate or a dish
of some sort.

1010
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:08,509
A plate?

1011
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,677
Well, not really
a plate.

1012
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:12,013
A heavy dish
of some sort.

1013
01:14:12,015 --> 01:14:13,981
We found small pieces
of ceramic

1014
01:14:13,983 --> 01:14:15,049
in her wounds.

1015
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:17,118
A casserole dish?

1016
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,654
Yeah, maybe.

1017
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:23,458
You said Miss Gamon brought
something over for dinner?

1018
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:26,160
Yes.

1019
01:14:26,162 --> 01:14:27,895
Did she take it
when she left?

1020
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:30,198
No. No, she
left it here.

1021
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,799
May I see it?

1022
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:33,468
It might be part
of a set.

1023
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:35,536
Sure.

1024
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,121
Is that the dish?

1025
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:56,891
She brought some sweet potato
stuff in it.

1026
01:14:56,893 --> 01:14:58,960
Let's have a look.

1027
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:06,133
Alright.
That's it for now.

1028
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:11,005
If you remember
anything else,

1029
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,073
please give me
a call.

1030
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:13,241
We will, thanks.

1031
01:15:13,243 --> 01:15:15,510
Good.

1032
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:28,523
(Sniffling)

1033
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,591
(Door closing)

1034
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:46,607
(Sniffling)

1035
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:48,676
(Crying)

1036
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:55,049
(Voice breaking)
Poor Linda.

1037
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:02,256
I just want to
take a shower.

1038
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:03,991
Me, too.

1039
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:05,593
When I get home.

1040
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:08,763
Jeffrey, can you
stay here tonight?

1041
01:16:08,765 --> 01:16:12,833
I don't want to be alone.

1042
01:16:12,835 --> 01:16:14,669
I'll be right back.

1043
01:16:14,671 --> 01:16:16,103
I just need to
change my clothes.

1044
01:16:16,105 --> 01:16:18,306
Thank you.

1045
01:16:18,308 --> 01:16:20,775
My name's Alex Smith,
I'm a reporter with the Times.

1046
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:23,110
I just want to find out
what's going on here.

1047
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:25,179
Can you tell me
what happened?

1048
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:32,820
(Crying)

1049
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:45,333
(Siren wailing
in distance)

1050
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:07,722
(Answering machine
beeping)

1051
01:17:07,724 --> 01:17:09,724
<i>Ali, it's Dr. Weinette.</i>

1052
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:11,726
<i>I hate to leave</i>
<i>a message like this</i>

1053
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:13,694
<i>but I was doing some digging</i>
<i>into Jeffrey's past</i>

1054
01:17:13,696 --> 01:17:15,329
<i>and, well, I have--</i>

1055
01:17:15,331 --> 01:17:18,165
<i>I have some serious</i>
<i>concerns.</i>

1056
01:17:18,167 --> 01:17:20,835
<i>Please call me on my cell</i>
<i>as soon as you can.</i>

1057
01:17:20,837 --> 01:17:22,103
<i>It's urgent.</i>

1058
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:23,638
(Machine beeping)

1059
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,673
Will help you through
the adjustment period.

1060
01:17:25,675 --> 01:17:27,108
He can be a great help.

1061
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:29,977
(Panting)

1062
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:33,047
(Glass shattering)

1063
01:17:33,049 --> 01:17:35,716
Something feels different
about this picture.

1064
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:36,917
What do you mean?

1065
01:17:36,919 --> 01:17:38,986
ALI:
It just doesn't
feel right.

1066
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:47,762
(Glass shattering)

1067
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:55,870
(Panting)

1068
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:57,938
Just making sure
the camera still works.

1069
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:01,375
(Beeping)

1070
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:04,445
(Water running)

1071
01:18:16,324 --> 01:18:18,392
(Shattering)

1072
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:22,897
This is mine.

1073
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,055
(Sighing)

1074
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,157
I'm sorry, Ali.

1075
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,293
I knew it was wrong

1076
01:18:52,295 --> 01:18:54,895
but I just couldn't
help it.

1077
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:57,832
I couldn't help myself.

1078
01:18:57,834 --> 01:18:59,900
I just wanted to be
close to you

1079
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:02,403
like they were.

1080
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:04,472
Please don't say that.

1081
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:10,478
It's so much better
when I'm here with you.

1082
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,747
Better than what?

1083
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,419
Than my life ever was.

1084
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:19,787
This is my life, Jeffrey.

1085
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:22,223
You can't just
take it like that.

1086
01:19:22,225 --> 01:19:24,425
I'm not taking it.

1087
01:19:24,427 --> 01:19:27,795
I just want to be
a part of it.

1088
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:33,868
I want to help you.

1089
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:36,470
Don't be scared of me.

1090
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:41,308
Ali...

1091
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:43,177
I love you.

1092
01:19:43,179 --> 01:19:46,814
You have no idea
what it was like

1093
01:19:46,816 --> 01:19:49,350
coming here every day,
seeing you,

1094
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:52,253
not being able
to tell you how I feel.

1095
01:19:52,255 --> 01:19:53,420
I found this.

1096
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:54,789
Give me that!

1097
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:56,357
I'll give it to you,
you son of a bitch.

1098
01:19:56,359 --> 01:19:58,359
You shouldn't
have done that!

1099
01:19:58,361 --> 01:20:00,127
You gave that to me!
That was mine!

1100
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,295
Ugh!

1101
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,364

He always talked about her
