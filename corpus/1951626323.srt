1
00:01:58,107 --> 00:01:59,438
What're you telling me?
He's not there?

2
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:01,439
- He's not in his trailer or what?
- No. He's not.

3
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,043
- Did you check craft service?
- Yes.

4
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:04,443
- He's not there either?
- No

5
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:07,013
How 'bout hair and make-up?
Did you check with the girls?

6
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:08,410
He's gone, Mickey.

7
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:10,108
I'm telling you, man.
He is gone!

8
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:11,411
Well, that's interesting.

9
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:13,020
Where do you think
he's gone off to?

10
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:14,020
Cause look around you.
What do you see?

11
00:02:14,189 --> 00:02:17,317
I see sand and big fucking rocks.
There is nowhere to go.

12
00:02:17,493 --> 00:02:19,017
Camera is ready!
I need him now!

13
00:02:19,194 --> 00:02:20,320
You copy that?

14
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:21,428
Yes, I copy that!

15
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:23,030
I copy!
Don't yell at me, Mickey!

16
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:24,222
I can't take that right now!

17
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:27,232
Howard! Are you in there?
You are killing me, buddy!

18
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:29,029
Camera is ready.
I need you out here now!

19
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:32,037
- He's not in there, man.
- Shut up!

20
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,243
Who're you?

21
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:38,641
What d'ya mean "who am I"?
Who're you?

22
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:39,337
Where's Howard?

23
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:41,107
Oh, my God!
Don't push me around like that!

24
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:42,409
Oh, my God!

25
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:46,411
Alright.
What the fuck is going? What?

26
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:47,316
Where is Howard?

27
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,292
- Howard? Who's Howard?
- Aw, Jesus! He is not in here?

28
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:51,316
I told you...

29
00:02:51,493 --> 00:02:54,018
Will you shut up!
Will you shut up!

30
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:21,214
Action!

31
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,030
Cut! Cut! No good.

32
00:03:34,102 --> 00:03:36,127
- Come on, get that horse!
- Camera reload!

33
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:38,637
- Get the other wrangler!
- Diffuse this lens.

34
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:46,444
What do you mean, he's gone!

35
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:48,413
I mean... He just

36
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:51,309
disappeared.

37
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:53,520
Disappeared!

38
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:32,621
Not dead.

39
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:35,529
How could I be not dead?

40
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:27,504
Hello!

41
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:40,020
Hello?

42
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:29,243
Hey! You want these?

43
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:31,743
- What?
- Want this set a'spurs?

44
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:35,515
- Free, like?
- Yeah.

45
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:38,011
What's wrong with'em?

46
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:39,018
There's nothing' wrong with 'em.

47
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:41,021
If you give me
your shirt and your vest,

48
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,022
I'll give you that set of spurs.
Okay? We'll swap.

49
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:46,526
I'll give you
these boots, too. Okay?

50
00:06:46,695 --> 00:06:49,027
- My shirt and my vest?
- Yeah.

51
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:50,226
Good deal?

52
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,232
- You'll give me the spurs?
- Yeah.

53
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:57,238
I'll give you this fancy jacket
and the stirrups.

54
00:06:57,406 --> 00:06:58,737
You want those?

55
00:06:58,907 --> 00:07:01,740
All right,
but you can't have my hat.

56
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,037
Because I've had this
thirty some odd years.

57
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:05,440
No, I don't want your hat.

58
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:08,014
I just want
your shirt and vest. Okay?

59
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:08,515
It's a deal?

60
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:12,710
All right.
They aren't good anyway.

61
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,216
Appreciate it.

62
00:07:17,092 --> 00:07:18,024
You bet.

63
00:07:19,795 --> 00:07:21,524
Warm out here.

64
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:27,631
And you can have this horse, too.
It's a pretty good gelding.

65
00:07:27,803 --> 00:07:30,135
You must be gettin'
outa' ranching altogether?

66
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:31,638
Yeah.

67
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:36,041
Is there a car rental place
around here?

68
00:07:36,812 --> 00:07:37,335
What?

69
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:41,107
- Place to rent cars.
- I ain't seen any.

70
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:42,011
train?

71
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:44,209
Oh, now and then.

72
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:47,020
Well, thanks.
Appreciate it.

73
00:07:47,088 --> 00:07:48,214
You bet.

74
00:08:38,907 --> 00:08:40,135
Who the fuck is that?

75
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:43,038
Some big shot
from the Bond company.

76
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:45,036
Let's go check him out.

77
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:56,518
I'd like to see
Mr. Spence's trailer, please.

78
00:08:56,691 --> 00:08:59,125
Ah, his trailer?

79
00:08:59,294 --> 00:09:01,319
That's right.
It's still here, isn't it?

80
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:04,522
Yes, The trailer is still here.

81
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:06,530
Ah, wouldn't you like to
come down and meet

82
00:09:06,701 --> 00:09:08,532
the director
and the producer first?

83
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:12,036
No, I'd like to see his trailer.
His mobile home.

84
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:14,541
- His mobile home.
- His mobile home.

85
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:16,040
Sure.

86
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:17,043
Right away.

87
00:09:17,512 --> 00:09:19,537
I got the producers on the line.
You wanna talk to 'em?

88
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:20,043
No.

89
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:21,204
Let me have the director
come down.

90
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:23,408
I'm sure he would be more than
happy to come right on down.

91
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:27,316
I don't want to see the director.
I don't want to see anyone.

92
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:29,320
I wanna be left alone.
Is that clear?

93
00:09:31,593 --> 00:09:32,719
Nice talking to you...

94
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:35,119
What a dick.

95
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:11,731
There is every indication

96
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,030
that Mr. Spence is engaged in
a totally irresponsible,

97
00:10:16,104 --> 00:10:19,335
self-indulgent,
immoral behavior.

98
00:10:19,507 --> 00:10:22,032
Not unlike many members
of his profession.

99
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,131
Hey!
Pull up there a second!

100
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:49,531
Let's see some I.D.?

101
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:54,336
I.D.?
You gotta be joking.

102
00:10:54,609 --> 00:10:56,042
- Mom?
- Howard?

103
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:56,736
Mom?

104
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:59,539
- Howard? Is that you?
- Yeah, it's me.

105
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:03,013
- Where in the world are you?
- I'm not sure.

106
00:11:03,084 --> 00:11:06,315
- Are you in good health?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Mom.

107
00:11:06,488 --> 00:11:09,218
- Are you far, far away?
- No. I think.

108
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:12,224
I mean I think I'm somewhere
in Utah, near the border.

109
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:14,021
What border is that, now?

110
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:16,029
Nevada.
The Nevada border.

111
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:17,121
You haven't been that close

112
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:19,823
since you went away
to do that movie years ago.

113
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:21,334
Yeah.

114
00:11:21,603 --> 00:11:27,041
Listen, Mom would you mind if I came
by and spend a couple days with you?

115
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:30,143
Well if you're that close and
you don't come and stay with me

116
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:34,008
you better not ever,
ever call me again. I swear...

117
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:37,017
Mom! You're breaking up
on me, Mom!

118
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:39,110
Can you hear me?

119
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:41,016
You're breaking up on me!

120
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:04,530
Okay. Here we go.

121
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:07,438
How many cards does he have?

122
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,041
Darn machines...

123
00:13:13,114 --> 00:13:15,014
Excuse me,
kind of in a hurry here.

124
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,311
Yeah. Sorry.

125
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:20,520
We are all waiting.
With our one card...

126
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:22,613
Thanks.

127
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:26,318
Say, excuse me, but
don't I know you from somewhere?

128
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:38,034
What! What the hell!

129
00:13:52,086 --> 00:13:54,111
<i>Attention all passengers.</i>

130
00:13:54,289 --> 00:14:01,024
<i>The bus to Elko is now board
in gand departing immediately.</i>

131
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:25,013
Adios!

132
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,437
You must be sky.

133
00:16:30,111 --> 00:16:33,444
Your mother will be very much
missed around here.

134
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:17,715
Oh, John.
Do you really have to leave?

135
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:21,618
I am sorry.

136
00:17:22,497 --> 00:17:25,523
I'm sorry!
But I... I can't do this.

137
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,134
Cut! Cut!
What's going on now?

138
00:17:28,302 --> 00:17:30,031
- What's wrong?
- I just... I can't do this!

139
00:17:30,104 --> 00:17:31,036
- What's wrong, Monica?
- I can't do this.

140
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:34,436
I am having a very difficulty me pretending
that he is supposed to be Howard.

141
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:36,338
I mean I can't kiss that guy!

142
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,240
Who is that guy?
That's not Howard.

143
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:40,608
It's just a temporary thing,
Monica.

144
00:17:40,782 --> 00:17:42,613
Temporary my ass!

145
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:44,513
Where is Howard?
When's he supposed to get here?

146
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:46,710
Howard's coming.
He's just going to be here soon

147
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:50,016
but what we've got to do is try
to continue until he gets here.

148
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:52,719
Why? I am supposed to
be acting with Howard Spence,

149
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:54,623
not some stand-in jerk-off.

150
00:17:54,796 --> 00:17:58,129
The bond company
wants us to keep shooting.

151
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:00,028
Fuck the bond company!

152
00:18:00,902 --> 00:18:03,234
- Wow! Hang on! Just wait a minute!
- Just get out of my way, ok.

153
00:18:03,404 --> 00:18:04,530
- Do you want any water...
- I'm going to my trailer.

154
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:06,730
I'm calling my agent.
Leave me alone!

155
00:18:06,908 --> 00:18:10,537
I haven't got anything
left to shoot.

156
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:13,045
Just some inserts.

157
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:14,706
Inserts will take half a day.

158
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:17,009
What we need is Howard!

159
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:21,317
We need Howard here
and we need Howard here now!

160
00:19:00,895 --> 00:19:02,021
Mom!

161
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:06,425
Howard.

162
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:14,433
What in the wide world
has become of you?

163
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:17,134
- Are you my son?
- Yeah. It's me, Mom.

164
00:19:21,682 --> 00:19:23,013
Is that all your luggage?

165
00:19:23,184 --> 00:19:25,118
Oh, I'm traveling light.

166
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:27,117
You didn't have
to bring any flowers.

167
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:28,516
I didn't.
These aren't for you!

168
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:32,523
What would you do
with a bunch of plastic roses?

169
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:34,422
Come on,
let's get going.

170
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:36,222
Sold the old ranch house?

171
00:19:36,397 --> 00:19:38,524
I had to when your father died...

172
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:40,030
So, You're not living
in the country anymore?

173
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:42,729
No. I moved ten years ago.

174
00:19:44,205 --> 00:19:46,036
I don't know
what to do with you, Mom.

175
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:50,134
It all happened so fast.

176
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:58,711
I mean, I remember you
talking about that place.

177
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:03,022
That place out near
where you grew up.

178
00:20:06,394 --> 00:20:09,522
You were always talking about that,
like you were happy there or something.

179
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:13,332
When I was a kid.

180
00:20:15,303 --> 00:20:17,032
You remember that?

181
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:21,732
Always seemed like
you liked that place.

182
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:27,404
I thought maybe.
I'd take you up there.

183
00:20:33,788 --> 00:20:35,016
Well, what were you
thinking about?

184
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:36,213
Nothing.

185
00:20:37,091 --> 00:20:41,323
So, now they'll be
looking for you, is that it?

186
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:42,723
Yeah. I guess.

187
00:20:42,897 --> 00:20:45,422
And you want me to
hide you out or something?

188
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,431
"Just like Jesse James?"

189
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:50,336
Yeah, "Just like Jesse James."

190
00:20:50,504 --> 00:20:54,031
Well, I suppose I could do that.
You are my son, aren't ya'?

191
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:56,542
I just need a place
to rest for a while, Mom.

192
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:59,043
Might as well be the place
you grew up in.

193
00:20:59,213 --> 00:21:00,043
Yeah.

194
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:04,311
You know, I always have
the same damn problem

195
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:08,012
finding your father's grave site.

196
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:09,613
Well don't you recognize
the stone, Mom?

197
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,621
Well. They'reall alike.

198
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:15,319
I mean, they used up all them pretty
little white arches during Vietnam.

199
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:19,727
Then, by the time your father died, all they
had were these simple slabs of granite.

200
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:23,026
Just a slab flat on the grou...

201
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:24,728
Here it is.

202
00:21:24,905 --> 00:21:26,634
- Is that it?
- Yes.

203
00:21:27,108 --> 00:21:31,636
I never thought it was appropriate
a flat slab on the ground.

204
00:21:32,513 --> 00:21:35,004
People just walk right
on top of it.

205
00:21:35,082 --> 00:21:37,016
Dogs pee on it.

206
00:21:37,084 --> 00:21:38,608
It just isn't right.

207
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,469
Gentlemen, I can shoot around
Howard for another day or two, but...

208
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:57,130
That doesn't solve the problom.

209
00:21:58,506 --> 00:22:01,236
I Well, you know, Mr. Daily, sir.

210
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:04,344
I don't see exactly how the director
or any of us, for that matter,

211
00:22:04,512 --> 00:22:06,639
can beheld totally accountable
for Howard's actions.

212
00:22:06,814 --> 00:22:09,612
Well somebody has to be held has to be
held accountable, don't they, Jim?

213
00:22:09,784 --> 00:22:13,117
I mean, Mr. Daily's company has
insured us for 30 million

214
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:15,221
- Thirty two point, five.
- Well, yes, of course.

215
00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:18,017
But Howard has a long history
of this kind of behavior.

216
00:22:18,092 --> 00:22:21,220
I don't think he's ever completely
disappeared before though, has.

217
00:22:21,395 --> 00:22:22,623
No, no.

218
00:22:22,797 --> 00:22:24,731
He's never done that before...

219
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:28,735
We gave the guarantee
of completion, didn't we?

220
00:22:28,803 --> 00:22:31,033
Yes, we did, Mr. Sutter.

221
00:22:32,707 --> 00:22:36,040
Well, then we'll find him.

222
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,738
There's no question.
We'll definitely find him.

223
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,718
What kind of trouble
are you in, Howard?

224
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:53,621
Trouble?

225
00:22:53,794 --> 00:22:56,422
Oh, it's nothing, Mom.
You know, I might end up

226
00:22:56,597 --> 00:22:58,030
owing a little bit of money.
That's all.

227
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:00,030
No, I don't mean...
I don't mean that.

228
00:23:01,202 --> 00:23:02,226
Then what?

229
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:06,432
Well, a man doesn't go off for
nigh thirty years without a word

230
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:08,234
then show up at his mother's door

231
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:10,639
unless there's some kind
of serious trouble.

232
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:14,008
No, I just...
I just needed to see you Ma.

233
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:15,512
I understand that part.

234
00:23:15,683 --> 00:23:18,015
I mean, I thought it'd dome
some good to come back here

235
00:23:18,085 --> 00:23:19,416
and just stay for a while,
you know.

236
00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:23,318
Have you been doing all that stuff what
they said about you in the magazines?

237
00:23:24,392 --> 00:23:25,518
What stuff?

238
00:23:25,693 --> 00:23:29,026
You know, that stuff...
like carousing around.

239
00:23:29,096 --> 00:23:30,222
You know the magazines are
magazines are just full of gossip.

240
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:32,730
I don't give two hoots about it.
I'm just curious.

241
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,528
No, I haven't been doing anything...
I haven't been doing any of that stuff.

242
00:23:35,703 --> 00:23:39,434
Because if you were doing all that stuff,
it's no wonder you're not feeling so hot.

243
00:23:39,607 --> 00:23:40,437
I feel fine.

244
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:43,042
With just the sheer
exhaustion of it.

245
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,042
I wasn't doing anything!

246
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:47,444
It's just that. that things came up
and they kind of snowballed and...

247
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:48,605
What, what things?

248
00:23:48,783 --> 00:23:51,217
Well, you know...
opportunities.

249
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:54,320
Opportunities are supposed to be
a good thing, aren't they?

250
00:23:54,488 --> 00:23:56,217
Yeah, but not always though.
Sometimes...

251
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,324
What the hell are you
are you staring at!

252
00:23:58,492 --> 00:24:01,222
Come on, Mom,
let's get sometimes when out of here.

253
00:24:01,395 --> 00:24:03,226
Well, I haven't
finished my coffee.

254
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:05,024
I've just gotta get some air.

255
00:24:13,808 --> 00:24:16,743
You'll have to excuse my son.
He's lost his manners.

256
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:19,436
That happens people
stray too far from home, Susy.

257
00:24:19,613 --> 00:24:21,103
Don't worry about it, Lulu.

258
00:24:27,087 --> 00:24:29,419
I don't know why you're so
upset about this, Mom. I mean...

259
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,117
Rudeness is one thing I've never
been able to tolerate, Howard.

260
00:24:33,294 --> 00:24:35,524
I mean...
I don't understand rudeness.

261
00:24:35,696 --> 00:24:37,220
I know, Mom, it's nothing.
It's over.

262
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:40,026
The man was staring at me.
It's rude to stare.

263
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,035
Well so be it. You didn't
need to take his head off.

264
00:24:43,103 --> 00:24:43,728
Well, I apologize.

265
00:24:43,904 --> 00:24:47,032
Well, it's embarrassing, Howard...
just embarrassing.

266
00:24:47,107 --> 00:24:50,133
Well I'm sorry...
Sorry.

267
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:56,105
So there... I prepared a room
for you downstairs.

268
00:24:56,283 --> 00:24:59,013
I hope it'll fit you.
I just...

269
00:24:59,086 --> 00:25:03,318
I just don't have all the space
we had in the old ranch house.

270
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:05,721
No. I'll be fine, Mom.
I'll be fine.

271
00:25:05,893 --> 00:25:09,522
Oh it's handy to the kitchen and
there's a bivy right down the hallway.

272
00:25:09,697 --> 00:25:11,028
Where do you sleep?

273
00:25:11,098 --> 00:25:12,531
Just down the hall.

274
00:25:13,801 --> 00:25:16,736
So, if you need anything,
you just holler.

275
00:25:16,904 --> 00:25:18,132
Well, thanks, Mom.

276
00:25:18,305 --> 00:25:19,636
Yes. Sure.

277
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:24,141
- Good night.
- Good night.

278
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:28,711
Oh, where is the basement?

279
00:25:28,883 --> 00:25:31,010
- Right through the kitchen.
- Okay.

280
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:32,780
- Night, night.
- Good night.

281
00:28:21,388 --> 00:28:24,016
There's jam and bread
in the kitchen Howard!

282
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:27,117
If you're hungry.
I don't know if you're hungry or not.

283
00:28:27,294 --> 00:28:28,124
I'm alright, Mom!

284
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:31,128
Well, if you're hungry,
you just help yourself!

285
00:28:31,298 --> 00:28:32,424
Thanks!

286
00:28:46,613 --> 00:28:48,410
Would you believe?

287
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,429
Hey, Ma!

288
00:30:15,602 --> 00:30:18,332
I think I'm gonna go out
and get some air, alright?

289
00:30:18,505 --> 00:30:20,234
Have a nice time!

290
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:44,216
What'll it be buddy?

291
00:31:45,492 --> 00:31:50,122
let me have a coke, please.

292
00:31:59,406 --> 00:32:01,135
Are you in the movies?

293
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:04,434
My friend says
you're in the movies.

294
00:32:12,886 --> 00:32:14,012
Change for a hundred.

295
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,898
And... no more bets.
No more bets, please.

296
00:32:39,713 --> 00:32:40,509
Here is your martini.

297
00:32:40,681 --> 00:32:42,615
- Thank you, dear.
- Anything for you?

298
00:32:42,783 --> 00:32:45,115
Hmmm... let me have a
"Jim Beam" on the rocks.

299
00:32:45,285 --> 00:32:46,513
I'll be right back.

300
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:01,033
What is so god damn
fascinating about me, huh?

301
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:02,227
Howard, Howard...

302
00:33:02,402 --> 00:33:03,630
Why do you keep
dogging me around?

303
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:07,035
Howard, it's me! It's me,
Cliff! Cliff Ormsby!

304
00:33:07,207 --> 00:33:08,333
Cliff Ormsby?

305
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:11,739
Yes, Plains High, 1959

306
00:33:11,912 --> 00:33:13,038
1959?

307
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:14,407
Yeah. Don't you remember me?

308
00:33:14,581 --> 00:33:16,014
I don't remember anything.

309
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:18,108
Nothing that ever happened back
then happened to me. Okay?

310
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:19,309
Alright.

311
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:22,521
God damn it!

312
00:33:25,192 --> 00:33:27,422
Hey! I was looking for you.

313
00:33:27,594 --> 00:33:30,722
There you are!
I thought you might've skipped out on me.

314
00:33:51,485 --> 00:33:53,316
Mr. Spence seems to
have done a good job

315
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:55,717
cutting himself off completely
from family and friends.

316
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:59,017
I have no traces to immediate
family, except his mother.

317
00:33:59,092 --> 00:34:01,322
Er, she lives in Elko, Nevada.

318
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:04,020
- That's very good, Miss Rontz.
- Thank you, sir.

319
00:34:04,197 --> 00:34:05,425
That's excellent work.

320
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,531
Thank you.

321
00:34:07,501 --> 00:34:09,628
Mothers are always
the last refuge, aren't they?

322
00:34:09,803 --> 00:34:10,428
Sure are, sir.

323
00:34:10,604 --> 00:34:12,231
Just a tick...

324
00:34:12,406 --> 00:34:16,137
Ah, oh, Sir are you there,
are you still there?

325
00:34:16,309 --> 00:34:17,071
Sir?

326
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,734
And you can contact the car
rental company

327
00:34:18,912 --> 00:34:21,005
and tell them that
we've located Mr. Spence's car...

328
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:22,011
Very good.

329
00:34:22,082 --> 00:34:23,310
at the Rio Grande bus terminal...

330
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:24,415
Er, Rio Grande?
Where is that, sir?

331
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:27,052
- Here in Salt Lake City.
- Alright.

332
00:34:27,187 --> 00:34:29,018
I'll be back in touch shortly.

333
00:34:56,817 --> 00:34:59,047
- Thanks very much...
- Sweaty.

334
00:35:00,987 --> 00:35:02,420
- Excuse me.
- That's right.

335
00:35:19,606 --> 00:35:22,598
The Fight of Your Life.

336
00:35:41,094 --> 00:35:45,030
Alright. I'm ready.
Are you ready? I'm ready. Ready?

337
00:35:45,098 --> 00:35:45,792
Alright.

338
00:35:58,645 --> 00:35:59,737
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

339
00:36:01,581 --> 00:36:02,513
Take it easy!

340
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:04,616
Take it easy!

341
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:08,220
Hey! Hey!

342
00:36:08,388 --> 00:36:09,116
Give me your arm.

343
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:10,313
God damn you!

344
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,720
Give me your...

345
00:36:12,893 --> 00:36:14,417
Just hang on a second.
Would you?

346
00:36:14,528 --> 00:36:16,463
- I need to take a pee.
- You can take a pee at the station.

347
00:36:16,463 --> 00:36:19,398
I've been having to pee
for a longtime.

348
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,431
Damn it, I... that machine
is crazy.

349
00:36:23,603 --> 00:36:26,037
You guys aren't from around
here are you?

350
00:36:26,106 --> 00:36:29,132
I grew up in this town.

351
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:31,743
My dad ranched right up here
in the Ruby Mountains.

352
00:36:31,912 --> 00:36:33,072
God damn it!

353
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:41,413
Don't you guys recognize me?
I've been in the movies.

354
00:36:41,488 --> 00:36:44,013
- I'm an actor.
- Why don't you tell that to the judge?

355
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,114
Yeah. He likes movies.

356
00:36:45,192 --> 00:36:47,524
I've been in lots of
lots ofWesterns.

357
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:49,421
This is my hometown.

358
00:36:49,596 --> 00:36:51,029
Yeah. I know it,

359
00:36:51,097 --> 00:36:54,032
Cowboy. Coming to tayayayeh, right?

360
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:13,008
Alright, right there.

361
00:37:23,897 --> 00:37:24,625
Morning, Charlie.

362
00:37:24,798 --> 00:37:27,232
Morning Mrs. Spence.

363
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,424
What's happened to Howard?

364
00:37:28,602 --> 00:37:31,730
Well, he was having a little
too much fun last night.

365
00:37:31,905 --> 00:37:33,031
Weren't you, Howie?

366
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:38,240
You keep an eye on him now,
Mrs. Spence.

367
00:37:38,411 --> 00:37:40,538
Oh, I will. Don't you worry
about that, Charlie.

368
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,615
Tell you the truth,
I didn't hardly recognize him at all.

369
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:45,512
I mean haven't seen him
in so long.

370
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:50,622
Of course I guess we've all gotten a little
bit longer in the tooth now, haven't we?

371
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:53,987
- I guess so, Charlie.
- Yeah, it happens. Yeah.

372
00:37:54,094 --> 00:37:56,028
- Bye.
- Bye, bye.

373
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,427
Yes, it happens.

374
00:38:01,301 --> 00:38:03,030
Did you have any fun
out there, last night?

375
00:38:03,169 --> 00:38:05,137
Haha, fun?

376
00:38:05,405 --> 00:38:06,531
Yeah.

377
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:12,135
Girls?
Drinking and gambling?

378
00:38:12,312 --> 00:38:14,007
No... Mom.

379
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,205
Well, it's supposed to be fun,
isn't it?

380
00:38:16,383 --> 00:38:17,714
I mean that's
what they claim.

381
00:38:17,884 --> 00:38:22,014
People come from miles
around to have fun.

382
00:38:22,088 --> 00:38:25,023
That's what
I thought it was, anyway.

383
00:38:25,191 --> 00:38:27,523
It's just designed
to be fun.

384
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:34,026
Yeah, I don't know.

385
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,534
I don't know what to do
with myself, anymore.

386
00:38:39,105 --> 00:38:41,539
Aren't you gonna' eat your eggs?

387
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:43,039
No. I'm not feeling so hot.

388
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:45,543
Well, hand the mover then.
No sense in wasting'em.

389
00:38:45,712 --> 00:38:47,009
They look good.

390
00:38:48,682 --> 00:38:49,512
Oh, thank you.

391
00:38:49,683 --> 00:38:51,378
A fork...

392
00:38:53,486 --> 00:38:58,981
Yeah, you don't happen to have any
pictures of your little family, do you?

393
00:39:02,095 --> 00:39:04,325
Mom and Howard
My... my... my family?

394
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:07,125
The child
you never told me about.

395
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,234
My grandson.

396
00:39:09,402 --> 00:39:12,337
And I had to find it out from
his poor mother back then.

397
00:39:12,505 --> 00:39:14,029
What child!

398
00:39:14,107 --> 00:39:18,635
Now don't tell me you gave it up for
adoption or something stupid like that?

399
00:39:20,113 --> 00:39:22,013
I don't know about any child.

400
00:39:22,082 --> 00:39:24,209
- You don't know?
- No.

401
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:27,519
How'd you get to
be such a mess, Howard?

402
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:31,318
A woman called me, years ago.

403
00:39:31,491 --> 00:39:36,519
Back, just after you'd finished that...
big motion picture of yours up there in Montana.

404
00:39:36,696 --> 00:39:39,961
The Western. Said she was
pregnant with your baby.

405
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:41,125
What woman was this?

406
00:39:41,301 --> 00:39:43,633
I don't know what woman?
You're the one who got her pregnant.

407
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:45,532
I never...
I never got any body pregnant!

408
00:39:45,705 --> 00:39:47,639
Well, she said that you did.

409
00:39:47,807 --> 00:39:50,139
She had a pretty
strong notion about it.

410
00:39:53,513 --> 00:39:54,309
What did she want?

411
00:39:54,381 --> 00:39:56,611
She wanted to know
if I'd seen you.

412
00:39:56,783 --> 00:40:00,014
Course I hadn't.
I never saw you again after that.

413
00:40:00,086 --> 00:40:03,021
And you were just
a total stranger.

414
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:08,049
She called from somewhere
up in Montana. I remember that.

415
00:40:08,795 --> 00:40:10,126
Montana?

416
00:40:16,903 --> 00:40:19,030
I got...
I gotta lie down, Mom.

417
00:40:19,105 --> 00:40:21,039
Oh... okay... don't you want
your orange juice, then?

418
00:40:21,207 --> 00:40:22,731
No. Thanks.

419
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:37,416
Mrs. Spence.

420
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,522
I'm looking for your son.

421
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:40,625
My son?

422
00:40:40,794 --> 00:40:43,524
I haven't seen him
in over thirty years.

423
00:40:43,696 --> 00:40:46,028
Ever since he became
a big movie star.

424
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:49,125
I mean you'd think he'd at least drop
his mother a card now and then, wouldn't you?

425
00:40:49,302 --> 00:40:50,132
Yes, you would.

426
00:40:50,303 --> 00:40:53,636
So you haven't heard
from him in thirty years.

427
00:40:53,706 --> 00:40:55,139
- Not a phone call?
- Na ah.

428
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:58,041
- Not an email?
- What's an email?

429
00:40:58,111 --> 00:41:01,205
Oh, you must be with the
movie company outfit, is that it?

430
00:41:01,381 --> 00:41:03,008
Sort of.

431
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:08,315
Well, Mrs. Spence, here's my card and
if you do happen to hear from your son,

432
00:41:08,388 --> 00:41:10,322
could you give me a call?
My numbers are all there.

433
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,424
Oh, I'd be glad to.

434
00:41:12,592 --> 00:41:15,026
I'd appreciate that.

435
00:41:15,094 --> 00:41:17,028
- Bye, bye.
- Goodbye, now.

436
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:22,734
Howard!
The coast is clear!

437
00:41:29,108 --> 00:41:34,102
I remember your father barreling down
those long, dusty roads in this thing,

438
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,215
heading back from
the cattle auctions.

439
00:41:37,383 --> 00:41:41,410
You could see him from miles away
Just a plume of dust.

440
00:41:41,588 --> 00:41:45,024
Like a giant rooster.
It was quite excitin', actually.

441
00:41:45,091 --> 00:41:47,616
It's a beauty, Mom.
Does it still run?

442
00:41:47,794 --> 00:41:49,421
Oh, I use it every week
for shopping,

443
00:41:49,596 --> 00:41:51,029
but... but I can walk
just as easy.

444
00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:53,324
You're sure?

445
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,435
Well, let me know now and then
where you're stayin'.

446
00:41:56,603 --> 00:41:58,730
- Keep in touch.
- I will, Mom.

447
00:42:02,108 --> 00:42:05,043
Oh, I packed some things
of your father's for you.

448
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:06,337
Thanks.

449
00:42:09,082 --> 00:42:11,016
Don't be a stranger!

450
00:42:11,084 --> 00:42:12,415
No. I'll give you a call.

451
00:42:23,897 --> 00:42:25,125
Runs like a top.

452
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:26,731
You look good.

453
00:42:32,105 --> 00:42:34,539
- Bye, Howie!
- Bye, Mom.

454
00:43:17,884 --> 00:43:19,317
Have you seen this man?

455
00:43:22,889 --> 00:43:24,117
Yeah. Yesterday.

456
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:30,021
Thank you.

457
00:43:56,789 --> 00:43:59,519
Excuse... Excuse me.

458
00:43:59,692 --> 00:44:00,624
Sorry.

459
00:44:00,793 --> 00:44:01,521
Pardon me.

460
00:44:01,694 --> 00:44:03,127
Excuse... Excuse me.

461
00:44:03,296 --> 00:44:06,299
Sorry. Ah... Excuse me.

462
00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:08,824
Sorry.

463
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:10,630
You got a room for one night?

464
00:44:10,803 --> 00:44:14,034
Well, this must be your lucky day, Mister.
We have one room left.

465
00:44:14,107 --> 00:44:14,698
Oh, good.

466
00:44:14,774 --> 00:44:16,435
It is a 'smoking' room though,
if that's all right.

467
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:18,440
Yeah that's fine. Thanks.

468
00:44:18,611 --> 00:44:20,408
Ah, you take cash money?

469
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,708
Yes, we certainly do.
Ah, what's your name?

470
00:44:23,883 --> 00:44:27,011
Ah, Spence.
Howard Spence.

471
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,618
Are you here on business,
Mr. Spence?

472
00:44:29,789 --> 00:44:31,222
No, I'm not.

473
00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:37,320
- Howard Spence?
- Yeah.

474
00:44:37,497 --> 00:44:39,624
The Howard Spence?

475
00:44:39,799 --> 00:44:42,131
No. No. No.

476
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:44,030
People mistake me for him.

477
00:44:46,906 --> 00:44:50,034
Hey, Mom! It's me again.
I'mon the road.

478
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:53,042
Where are you heading now,
Howard?

479
00:44:53,112 --> 00:44:58,015
Well, I thought
I'd go up to Montana
and try to find that woman.

480
00:44:58,084 --> 00:44:59,608
What woman is that?

481
00:44:59,786 --> 00:45:01,981
Well, you know, the one you told me about.
The woman with the baby.

482
00:45:02,088 --> 00:45:03,112
Oh, yes of course.

483
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:04,620
You don't remember her name?
Do you?

484
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:06,224
- Her name?
- You got a name?

485
00:45:06,392 --> 00:45:09,020
How would I remember a name
after thirty years?

486
00:45:09,095 --> 00:45:11,120
It wasn't...
was it 'Doreen'?

487
00:45:11,297 --> 00:45:12,321
What's that?

488
00:45:12,498 --> 00:45:16,229
Doreen! She used to work
as a waitress up there.

489
00:45:16,402 --> 00:45:17,733
It was so long ago.

490
00:45:17,904 --> 00:45:22,034
Well, it certainly was, Howard,
where are you calling from?

491
00:45:22,108 --> 00:45:25,043
God, I mean, the kid must
be thirty almost by now.

492
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:28,103
Where does the time go?
It's unbelievable.

493
00:45:28,281 --> 00:45:30,306
What's all that noise?

494
00:45:30,483 --> 00:45:34,010
I hope you see
this thing through, Howard.

495
00:45:34,087 --> 00:45:36,521
You owe it to that woman.

496
00:45:36,689 --> 00:45:39,317
Oh, excuse me.
Someone is at the door.

497
00:45:39,492 --> 00:45:41,016
Goodbye, Howard.

498
00:45:44,397 --> 00:45:45,421
Coming!

499
00:45:54,107 --> 00:45:55,734
Good evening, Mrs. Spence.

500
00:45:55,908 --> 00:45:59,036
- It's you.
- Yes, it's me.

501
00:45:59,212 --> 00:46:02,010
Sorry to be such a nuisance.

502
00:46:02,181 --> 00:46:06,413
Would you like to come in
and have some cookies and milk?

503
00:46:06,586 --> 00:46:09,214
Cookies?

504
00:46:09,388 --> 00:46:11,015
What kind?

505
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,423
Peanut butter,
with little chips of butterscotch.

506
00:46:16,195 --> 00:46:17,025
I'll try one.

507
00:46:17,196 --> 00:46:20,723
Oh, just come on in then
and help yourself.

508
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,028
I've just baked them.

509
00:46:24,203 --> 00:46:27,730
Oh, that's very kind of you,
Mrs. Spence.

510
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:35,012
- Are you staying in Elko, Mr...
- Sutter. Mr. Sutter.

511
00:46:35,081 --> 00:46:36,605
Sutter?

512
00:46:36,783 --> 00:46:41,618
Ah, no.
I'm just passing through.

513
00:46:41,788 --> 00:46:43,415
That's about all you
can do here, isn't it?

514
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:45,614
Just pass on through.

515
00:46:47,193 --> 00:46:48,421
Here.

516
00:46:48,594 --> 00:46:53,122
You lied to me,
didn't you, Mrs. Spence?

517
00:46:53,299 --> 00:46:54,231
I beg your pardon?

518
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,027
You deliberately lied to me
about your son.

519
00:46:56,202 --> 00:46:58,033
He was here all along, wasn'the?

520
00:46:59,305 --> 00:47:02,035
I don't know what in the world
you're talking about.

521
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:05,439
I've never told anything
but the truth in my whole life.

522
00:47:06,312 --> 00:47:09,611
Lying is for cowards,
Mr. Sutter. Hmm?

523
00:47:11,784 --> 00:47:13,308
Excellent cookies.

524
00:47:15,288 --> 00:47:17,017
Housekeeping!

525
00:47:21,194 --> 00:47:25,324
Oh, shit! Oh. Hey! Hey!
Come on, everybody

526
00:47:25,498 --> 00:47:28,228
up... up, up, up.
Everybody outta here!

527
00:47:28,401 --> 00:47:31,234
God damn it. Oh, my God.

528
00:47:31,404 --> 00:47:33,736
Here, Get your stuff.
Come on.

529
00:47:33,906 --> 00:47:35,430
Whose stuff is this?

530
00:47:35,508 --> 00:47:36,338
Come on. Get outa' here!

531
00:47:36,409 --> 00:47:39,037
Let's go. Come on.

532
00:47:39,212 --> 00:47:41,009
Everybody out.
Here we go. Is that yours?

533
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,613
Come on, come on, come on...

534
00:47:43,082 --> 00:47:44,208
What do you want?

535
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,214
Would you like me to
come back later, sir?

536
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:49,013
Yeah! No! Don't come back!
Don't ever come back!

537
00:47:49,088 --> 00:47:52,319
Hey, wait a second!
Is this... wait! That's yours?

538
00:47:52,491 --> 00:47:55,016
- Thanks, Howie.
- Bye.

539
00:47:56,095 --> 00:48:00,031
Ah, great. Great.
You've done it again.

540
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,530
Ahhh god!

541
00:48:08,507 --> 00:48:14,207
Nice. Nice. Way to go.
Terrific.

542
00:48:17,483 --> 00:48:20,316
Oh, God.

543
00:48:26,392 --> 00:48:28,019
Oh, boy.

544
00:48:31,597 --> 00:48:35,033
Just see if you
can get to Montana.

545
00:50:26,812 --> 00:50:28,404
You want me to freshen that up?

546
00:50:31,784 --> 00:50:33,115
Can I help you, sir?

547
00:50:33,285 --> 00:50:36,015
Oh, just a cup of coffee,
thanks.

548
00:50:36,188 --> 00:50:38,713
- You want Coffee mate with it?
- Yeah. Sure.

549
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:18,718
I'm probably not going to
get out of here until midnight so...

550
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:21,021
Can I get a room
for a couple of nights?

551
00:52:21,093 --> 00:52:23,220
Yes, sir. No problem.

552
00:52:23,395 --> 00:52:25,329
Ah, would you fill this out, please?

553
00:52:25,498 --> 00:52:26,624
You take cash, I hope.

554
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:29,029
Absolutely.
Here is your room key.

555
00:52:29,101 --> 00:52:32,036
You're in 201,
just down the hall.

556
00:53:18,184 --> 00:53:24,123
Ancient history now.
This place is just full of ghosts.

557
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:26,019
Are you from out of town?

558
00:53:26,192 --> 00:53:29,423
Ah, yeah, sort of.
My Mom was from Butte.

559
00:53:29,595 --> 00:53:32,029
She was?
What was her name?

560
00:53:32,198 --> 00:53:34,826
Oh, you wouldn't know her.
She kind of...

561
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,026
she came and went a lot.

562
00:53:36,202 --> 00:53:39,729
Ahh, yeah.
Well, she's not alone.

563
00:53:39,905 --> 00:53:42,237
There's only a few
of us die-hards left here.

564
00:53:42,408 --> 00:53:45,036
What movie was this?
It's a Western?

565
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:46,236
Yeah.

566
00:53:46,412 --> 00:53:48,312
It was shot right around here,
wasn't it?

567
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:50,207
Right here. Yep.

568
00:53:52,484 --> 00:53:55,715
Must have been really exciting.

569
00:53:55,888 --> 00:53:57,412
Yeah, well.
For about five minutes.

570
00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:01,617
And then "real life" came back
and took its place.

571
00:54:01,794 --> 00:54:04,422
Yeah. I don't know I thinker...

572
00:54:05,898 --> 00:54:08,025
I think I like the movies better.

573
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,032
Than what?

574
00:54:11,103 --> 00:54:12,127
Than real life.

575
00:54:16,809 --> 00:54:22,008
Well, you let me know if you want
some coffee or something, huh, honey?

576
00:54:22,181 --> 00:54:23,113
Thanks.

577
00:54:28,887 --> 00:54:45,032
Strike a pose, imagining loud
and ecstatic, applause.

578
00:54:45,104 --> 00:55:00,008
Simply because...
you are on pause.

579
00:55:32,785 --> 00:55:49,032
Strike my face so we can see
if it leaves some kind of mark.

580
00:55:49,101 --> 00:56:02,208
No, it's too dark.
My, it's dark.

581
00:56:07,086 --> 00:56:08,212
Excuse me.

582
00:56:13,892 --> 00:56:16,019
Ah, Ginger Ale, please.

583
00:56:47,693 --> 00:56:49,524
Well, it took you long enough.

584
00:56:56,502 --> 00:56:58,527
Thank you. Thank you folks.

585
00:57:00,105 --> 00:57:02,335
This next song is for everybody

586
00:57:02,508 --> 00:57:05,136
who's ever been shaken,
rattled and rolled...

587
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:07,608
He's got a pretty good voice,
don't you think?

588
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:10,409
Dedicated to Bill Haley.
Okay guys.

589
00:57:10,482 --> 00:57:15,419
- Where have you been, Howard?
- One, two, three. one, two, three

590
00:57:15,587 --> 00:57:17,521
Where in the world
have you been?

591
00:57:17,689 --> 00:57:19,020
I don't know.

592
00:57:19,191 --> 00:57:23,321
Just kinda' fell off the face
of the earth, huh?

593
00:57:23,495 --> 00:57:24,427
Yeah.

594
00:57:27,099 --> 00:57:30,034
You know,
I looked for you for a while.

595
00:57:30,102 --> 00:57:32,036
I tried to find you.

596
00:57:32,104 --> 00:57:34,334
I looked everywhere.

597
00:57:34,506 --> 00:57:37,031
- I even tracked down your mother.
- My mother?

598
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:38,337
Yeah. Didn't she tell you?

599
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:40,705
No, I haven't seen her for
a good long while.

600
00:57:42,781 --> 00:57:44,715
That's too bad, Howard.

601
00:57:44,883 --> 00:57:48,216
You should never lose
track of your mother.

602
00:57:59,598 --> 00:58:01,623
So, what are you doing
back up here?

603
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,324
Oh, you know.
Just kind of...

604
00:58:03,502 --> 00:58:06,232
kind of passing through.

605
00:58:06,405 --> 00:58:10,341
Just... passing through?
On a whim?

606
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:13,637
Yeah, I thought I'd just
drop back through...

607
00:58:26,892 --> 00:58:30,328
Well, ifyou're
looking for your son...

608
00:58:30,496 --> 00:58:34,023
That's him.
Right there in front 'a you.

609
00:58:49,781 --> 00:58:52,511
It's really good to
see you again, Howard.

610
00:58:52,684 --> 00:58:55,517
Wait a second!
Can I get you a drink or some...

611
00:59:06,098 --> 00:59:07,429
Doreen!

612
00:59:20,712 --> 00:59:24,011
Thank you.
Thank you, guys, Thanks.

613
00:59:24,182 --> 00:59:26,309
We'll take a short break.
Come back.

614
00:59:26,485 --> 00:59:29,010
Tip the bartender...
Thanks.

615
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:07,622
- Hey!
- What?

616
01:00:07,793 --> 01:00:09,021
What's your story, pal?

617
01:00:09,094 --> 01:00:09,719
What are you talking about?

618
01:00:09,895 --> 01:00:11,021
What're you doing?
You're following me or something?

619
01:00:11,096 --> 01:00:12,324
No, I'm not following you.

620
01:00:12,497 --> 01:00:14,431
Who is this joker, baby?
You know this joker?

621
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,328
He's been following me.

622
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,069
I am not following you.
Don't be ridiculous.

623
01:00:17,069 --> 01:00:19,037
- You've been following me!
- Get your hands off me!

624
01:00:19,104 --> 01:00:20,731
He's a narc. He's a narc!

625
01:00:20,906 --> 01:00:22,134
- I bet! He's a narc!
- A narc?

626
01:00:22,307 --> 01:00:23,035
What are you? Nuts?

627
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:24,334
He's lying!

628
01:00:24,509 --> 01:00:26,033
Who are you, then?
Who the fuck are you?

629
01:00:26,211 --> 01:00:28,008
I'm your father!

630
01:00:36,788 --> 01:00:40,121
Well shit howdy!
I didn't know you had no daddy.

631
01:00:40,292 --> 01:00:41,020
Shut up will ya!

632
01:00:41,193 --> 01:00:42,319
You got a father.

633
01:00:42,494 --> 01:00:45,122
Out of the blue.
Kabla mo!

634
01:00:53,805 --> 01:00:57,036
Your daddy is a narc, Earlie!

635
01:01:20,198 --> 01:01:23,031
What in the world
did you expect?

636
01:02:37,409 --> 01:02:40,139
- I wanna go to bed.
- I know baby. Come on.

637
01:03:47,112 --> 01:03:49,012
What are you doin'?
Who are you?

638
01:03:49,181 --> 01:03:51,012
Can I talk to you for a second?

639
01:03:51,082 --> 01:03:52,515
What for?
Who the hell are you?

640
01:03:52,684 --> 01:03:53,514
I need to talk to you.

641
01:03:53,685 --> 01:03:55,312
What about?

642
01:03:55,887 --> 01:03:57,616
It's just, something...

643
01:03:57,789 --> 01:03:59,723
What's going on, Earlie?

644
01:03:59,891 --> 01:04:01,518
I got somebody up here now!

645
01:04:01,693 --> 01:04:03,718
- It doesn't matter!
- What is it!

646
01:04:03,795 --> 01:04:06,127
Can't you just tell me
from down there!

647
01:04:07,299 --> 01:04:09,028
It's about your father!

648
01:04:30,288 --> 01:04:32,222
What is wrong with you?

649
01:04:35,594 --> 01:04:39,030
Ah, you allowed to,
uh, sit down with customers?

650
01:04:40,498 --> 01:04:42,022
Yeah. Sure.

651
01:04:44,803 --> 01:04:48,034
Kinda...
running the place now huh?

652
01:04:48,106 --> 01:04:52,634
Yeah. Yip I've stepped up
in the world.

653
01:04:56,681 --> 01:04:59,616
So, what are you doing
back herein Butte, Howard?

654
01:04:59,784 --> 01:05:02,014
What's going on with you?

655
01:05:02,087 --> 01:05:05,215
Well, I don't know.

656
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:08,223
I just kind of came to
the end of something. I guess.

657
01:05:08,293 --> 01:05:09,521
Of what?

658
01:05:09,694 --> 01:05:17,032
A whole string of little disasters.
Little train wrecks.

659
01:05:17,102 --> 01:05:19,798
- Was I one of 'em?
- You? No.

660
01:05:19,905 --> 01:05:23,033
No. It was after.
it was after that, after I left.

661
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:25,233
everything just, kinda.
pass went downhill.

662
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:28,004
Wow!
That was a long time ago.

663
01:05:28,179 --> 01:05:29,305
Wasn't it?

664
01:05:29,481 --> 01:05:31,005
Yes, you're right.

665
01:05:34,686 --> 01:05:39,419
Did you...
Did you talk to Earl last night?

666
01:05:39,591 --> 01:05:41,024
Earl? Oh, that's his name? 'Earl'.

667
01:05:41,092 --> 01:05:43,219
Yeah. Yeah.

668
01:05:46,498 --> 01:05:48,830
I don't get it, Howard.

669
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:52,336
I mean, what did you what did you
come back up here for?

670
01:05:52,504 --> 01:05:55,337
You knew all about him... about Earl.
You knew I had your kid.

671
01:05:55,507 --> 01:05:57,236
No. I didn't.
I mean I just found out.

672
01:05:57,409 --> 01:05:59,036
I just now...

673
01:06:00,211 --> 01:06:05,410
Well, my mother did tell me.

674
01:06:06,184 --> 01:06:08,209
Yeah, I figured that.

675
01:06:08,386 --> 01:06:10,513
That's the kind of thing

676
01:06:10,689 --> 01:06:14,125
a mother would find hard
to keep from her son.

677
01:06:16,394 --> 01:06:17,520
So, isn't that er...

678
01:06:17,696 --> 01:06:21,325
why you came up here to meet him?
I mean, isn't that the only reason

679
01:06:21,499 --> 01:06:23,126
Yeah, yeah, of course it was!

680
01:06:23,301 --> 01:06:26,134
I just didn't know
it was gonna be so...

681
01:06:26,304 --> 01:06:28,033
So, what?

682
01:06:28,907 --> 01:06:34,607
Hard.

683
01:06:34,779 --> 01:06:38,715
Looking in his face.
His eyes.

684
01:06:38,883 --> 01:06:41,010
- I didn't...
- What?

685
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:49,117
I didn't know I was gonna
recognize him like that.

686
01:06:49,294 --> 01:06:50,625
Like what?

687
01:06:53,698 --> 01:06:55,632
Seeing myself in him.

688
01:06:57,402 --> 01:06:59,734
And...

689
01:07:01,806 --> 01:07:04,639
he was seeing me the same way, too.
I could tell.

690
01:07:06,411 --> 01:07:08,003
What way was that?

691
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,010
I don't know. Just scared, I guess.
Just plain scared.

692
01:07:36,908 --> 01:07:40,241
I don't know, baby. Why can't we just be
how we used to be, Earl.

693
01:07:40,412 --> 01:07:42,607
Why is that?
Why is that Earlie?

694
01:07:42,781 --> 01:07:44,009
You remember
how we used to be?

695
01:07:44,082 --> 01:07:45,413
Oh can't we try
and be like that?

696
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:48,416
You remember, baby...

697
01:07:50,488 --> 01:07:54,015
You just don't even
want a woman, do you?

698
01:07:54,092 --> 01:07:55,024
That's it, isn't it?

699
01:07:55,093 --> 01:07:57,527
You don't even
want a woman! Aha!

700
01:07:57,695 --> 01:08:00,027
Why don't you want
a woman, Earl?

701
01:08:00,098 --> 01:08:03,033
Why is that? I mean,
what is up with that.

702
01:08:05,804 --> 01:08:10,036
Baby, is it just 'cause you're
so messed up in your mind?

703
01:08:10,108 --> 01:08:12,838
You're just so fucked up
that you don't even know

704
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:16,005
how lucky you might be
to have a woman like me?

705
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:00,114
Hello?

706
01:09:05,597 --> 01:09:06,723
Hello?

707
01:09:51,209 --> 01:09:52,733
I need to talk to you.

708
01:09:54,078 --> 01:09:56,410
Oh, okay.

709
01:09:56,581 --> 01:10:00,415
Now. It's important, Mom.

710
01:10:00,585 --> 01:10:03,110
- Alright. Er...
- Where?

711
01:10:03,288 --> 01:10:05,518
Well, then let's go out back.

712
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:26,540
- What's going on?
- What?

713
01:10:28,179 --> 01:10:31,205
This guy, this man
came in the bar last night.

714
01:10:31,382 --> 01:10:33,316
What about him?

715
01:10:33,484 --> 01:10:37,011
- You know him?
- Yes, I know him.

716
01:10:37,188 --> 01:10:40,214
Yeah, he say he's my father!

717
01:10:41,693 --> 01:10:43,024
Did he tell you that?

718
01:10:43,094 --> 01:10:44,220
- That's what he told me.
- Yeah!

719
01:10:44,395 --> 01:10:48,422
Is he? Is he my father?
This... this guy?

720
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,033
Yes, he is.

721
01:10:51,769 --> 01:10:54,738
- He is?
- Yes.

722
01:10:54,906 --> 01:10:57,238
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

723
01:11:00,111 --> 01:11:01,510
Well, who the fuck is he?
Where'd he come back here?

724
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:04,204
- Where'd he suddenly came back here?
- I told you. You watch

725
01:11:04,382 --> 01:11:07,510
No, you told me nothing.
You told me jack shit!

726
01:11:07,685 --> 01:11:09,016
What did you tell me?
When did you tell me?

727
01:11:09,187 --> 01:11:10,711
I told you a long time ago.

728
01:11:10,888 --> 01:11:11,718
You told me nothing!

729
01:11:11,889 --> 01:11:15,325
You told me there was some...
some actor or something.

730
01:11:15,493 --> 01:11:17,518
- You never said that...
- There was.

731
01:11:17,695 --> 01:11:18,525
What?

732
01:11:18,696 --> 01:11:20,527
An actor.

733
01:11:23,201 --> 01:11:25,226
Him?
He's the actor?

734
01:11:25,403 --> 01:11:27,030
Yes.

735
01:11:28,406 --> 01:11:31,341
I don't believe this!
I don't fucking believe this.

736
01:11:33,211 --> 01:11:36,305
You know,
I tried to tell you but...

737
01:11:39,484 --> 01:11:41,008
Why'd he come back here, Mom?

738
01:11:41,085 --> 01:11:41,710
What?

739
01:11:41,886 --> 01:11:43,513
Why'd he comeback here?

740
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:47,415
I don't know.
I don't know.

741
01:11:47,592 --> 01:11:49,321
- Didn't you talk to him?
- Yes.

742
01:11:49,494 --> 01:11:53,430
Maybe... Maybe,
he wanted to see you.

743
01:11:56,501 --> 01:11:58,025
What's his name?

744
01:12:03,107 --> 01:12:04,039
Howard.

745
01:12:04,108 --> 01:12:07,009
Howard? What a
dumb fuckin' name that is.

746
01:12:07,178 --> 01:12:09,009
Howard Spence.

747
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:10,604
Sounds like a dentist.

748
01:12:10,882 --> 01:12:14,716
Well, that's his name.

749
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:19,215
And he's an actor?

750
01:12:20,391 --> 01:12:21,415
Yes.

751
01:12:21,592 --> 01:12:22,320
A movie actor?

752
01:12:22,493 --> 01:12:26,020
That's... that's where you met him?
When... when he did that movie up here?

753
01:12:27,298 --> 01:12:31,029
And you just...
you just fucked him?

754
01:12:35,707 --> 01:12:38,039
He doesn't look anything
like me, does he?

755
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:43,404
Mom!

756
01:12:49,087 --> 01:12:50,019
Huh?

757
01:12:55,093 --> 01:12:56,219
No, honey.

758
01:12:57,695 --> 01:12:59,026
Not at all.

759
01:12:59,097 --> 01:13:01,531
I liked it better
when I never knew who he was.

760
01:13:01,699 --> 01:13:03,633
I liked that
a whole lot better!

761
01:13:15,079 --> 01:13:16,410
Thanks, Mom!

762
01:13:17,582 --> 01:13:19,015
Thanks a lot.

763
01:13:21,786 --> 01:13:23,310
Well, well, well.

764
01:14:10,902 --> 01:14:13,029
Get the fuck out!

765
01:14:14,305 --> 01:14:16,739
When you calm your ass down,
you call me!

766
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:06,616
It's open!

767
01:15:12,296 --> 01:15:15,026
You can go ahead and make the bed.
I won't get in your way.

768
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:18,732
Oh, you're not the maid,
are you?

769
01:15:20,204 --> 01:15:21,136
Sorry...

770
01:15:23,107 --> 01:15:25,132
Weren't you over at the M&M?

771
01:15:25,309 --> 01:15:26,139
Yeah.

772
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:30,709
You were staring at me.
What's the story?

773
01:15:31,282 --> 01:15:33,011
You're an actor, right?

774
01:15:33,084 --> 01:15:35,518
Look! This is a
private room here, okay?

775
01:15:35,686 --> 01:15:37,313
Would you just get outta here.

776
01:15:38,089 --> 01:15:39,716
I don't care if you are or not.

777
01:15:40,691 --> 01:15:42,716
I'm not a fan or anything.

778
01:15:42,894 --> 01:15:44,418
I don't have
"fans" anymore, honey.

779
01:15:44,595 --> 01:15:45,619
I'm all washed-up.

780
01:15:45,796 --> 01:15:47,320
"Seen better days."
You understand?

781
01:15:47,498 --> 01:15:50,626
Now, look. Would you
please now just go away?

782
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:54,737
What're you doing
in here anyway?

783
01:15:54,906 --> 01:15:56,635
What is that you're holding?

784
01:15:57,909 --> 01:15:59,740
That's my mother.

785
01:15:59,911 --> 01:16:03,210
Look! I am not in the mood
for whackos right now.

786
01:16:03,381 --> 01:16:05,110
You used to know her,
I think.

787
01:16:08,185 --> 01:16:09,311
Would you please leave?

788
01:16:09,487 --> 01:16:11,614
Or do you want me
to throw you out?

789
01:16:11,789 --> 01:16:13,017
I'll leave.

790
01:16:17,395 --> 01:16:20,421
What are you doing?

791
01:16:20,598 --> 01:16:22,031
What is that?

792
01:16:27,505 --> 01:16:28,437
Bye.

793
01:16:53,197 --> 01:16:54,630
What the fuck
are you doing here!

794
01:16:54,799 --> 01:16:57,324
I was wondering, if maybe
we could talk or something.

795
01:16:57,501 --> 01:16:59,025
- Talk?
- Yeah.

796
01:16:59,604 --> 01:17:00,730
Talk!
What do you wanna talk about!

797
01:17:00,805 --> 01:17:02,136
The weather maybe?

798
01:17:14,185 --> 01:17:15,516
Watch it, buddy!

799
01:17:18,589 --> 01:17:20,022
What do you want?

800
01:17:20,091 --> 01:17:22,252
What're you doing here!
What do you want from me?

801
01:17:30,101 --> 01:17:33,036
- I just...
- You're crazy?

802
01:17:33,104 --> 01:17:34,230
wanted to see you.
That's all.

803
01:17:34,405 --> 01:17:35,736
- See me?
- Yeah.

804
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:37,339
Well, here I am!

805
01:17:37,508 --> 01:17:39,135
This is me!
You're seeing me right now!

806
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:40,777
Recognize anything?

807
01:17:44,682 --> 01:17:46,013
My mother told me about you.

808
01:17:46,183 --> 01:17:47,013
- Your mother?
- Yeah.

809
01:17:47,084 --> 01:17:48,210
You've got a mother?

810
01:17:53,391 --> 01:17:55,018
What's she say
about me huh?

811
01:17:57,695 --> 01:17:58,719
What she say about me?

812
01:17:59,196 --> 01:18:00,629
Not much.

813
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:05,428
Are you out of your
fucking mind or something?

814
01:18:05,603 --> 01:18:08,629
I mean, It thought I was fucked up!
Your mother?

815
01:18:08,806 --> 01:18:10,239
You're a full grown man!

816
01:18:12,109 --> 01:18:15,101
Yeah, I still got a mother.

817
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,010
Well, that's...
that's a miracle.

818
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:19,606
Yeah.

819
01:18:19,784 --> 01:18:21,308
Who is your mother, anyway?

820
01:18:24,288 --> 01:18:26,722
- She's...
- Never mind who she is!

821
01:18:26,791 --> 01:18:29,419
She's supposed to
be my grandmother, I suppose?

822
01:18:31,796 --> 01:18:33,024
Yeah. I guess he is.

823
01:18:33,097 --> 01:18:35,031
You know
I don't care who she is!

824
01:18:35,099 --> 01:18:38,330
I don't care who you are.
This is so fucked up!

825
01:18:38,502 --> 01:18:40,026
Fucking asshole.

826
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:51,004
- I just thought... maybe...
- What! Just thought what?

827
01:18:51,082 --> 01:18:55,610
Just thought you'd casually
drive back into town here?

828
01:18:58,189 --> 01:19:02,319
Back to the scene of the crime
twenty some years later...

829
01:19:02,493 --> 01:19:05,121
and just kind
a introduce yourself?

830
01:19:06,097 --> 01:19:08,622
Thought maybe we'd slap
each other on the back,

831
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,731
go have a couple shots
of Tequila

832
01:19:10,901 --> 01:19:12,425
and crack a few jokes
about "the old lady"

833
01:19:12,603 --> 01:19:15,538
or something stupid like that!
Is that it? Huh?

834
01:19:15,706 --> 01:19:17,230
Is that what you thought?

835
01:19:18,709 --> 01:19:19,733
Yeah.

836
01:19:21,178 --> 01:19:23,009
You're not my father!

837
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:25,605
You've never have been my father
and you never will be!

838
01:19:25,783 --> 01:19:28,411
You got that?
Go fuck yourself, man.

839
01:19:28,586 --> 01:19:30,019
You're pathetic!

840
01:20:03,687 --> 01:20:05,712
Huh, oh fuck.

841
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:28,319
He didn't jump, did he?

842
01:23:28,492 --> 01:23:30,016
What?

843
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,124
No.

844
01:23:38,302 --> 01:23:42,432
Good. That's good.

845
01:23:44,708 --> 01:23:46,335
He wouldn't talk to you,
I guess?

846
01:23:47,778 --> 01:23:48,608
No.

847
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:51,714
No?
He wouldn't talk to me either.

848
01:23:53,484 --> 01:23:55,111
He's scared, I guess.

849
01:23:57,888 --> 01:24:00,618
Why would he be scared 'a you?

850
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:03,316
Just the idea that
we might be related.

851
01:24:04,895 --> 01:24:07,022
He doesn't wanna be related,
I don't think.

852
01:24:07,798 --> 01:24:09,322
Guess not.

853
01:24:10,801 --> 01:24:12,029
Do you?

854
01:24:12,102 --> 01:24:13,126
What?

855
01:24:13,704 --> 01:24:15,228
Wanna be related?

856
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,402
I thought I did.

857
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:24,707
Why?

858
01:24:25,582 --> 01:24:28,210
Why suddenly, when you haven't
been for so long?

859
01:24:31,088 --> 01:24:33,022
I just started thinking
maybe I missed everything.

860
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:38,025
You know, maybe
I threw everything away.

861
01:24:38,195 --> 01:24:40,720
Cut myself off.

862
01:24:40,898 --> 01:24:43,423
Why did you let so much time go by?

863
01:24:46,303 --> 01:24:48,533
I didn't know it was passing.

864
01:24:55,079 --> 01:24:56,410
You're gonna leave now?

865
01:24:57,081 --> 01:24:59,606
Leave town? I mean, since
it didn't work out with Earl?

866
01:24:59,783 --> 01:25:02,115
I've got nowhere to go.

867
01:25:02,286 --> 01:25:04,015
Maybe you should just stay here.

868
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:08,619
You mean live here?
In Butte?

869
01:25:08,792 --> 01:25:10,726
Yeah why not?

870
01:25:10,894 --> 01:25:15,024
It's not a bad little town.
Lots of history.

871
01:25:15,099 --> 01:25:17,033
What am I gonna do here?

872
01:25:17,101 --> 01:25:18,625
Make it your home.

873
01:25:20,204 --> 01:25:21,728
You need a home, don't you?

874
01:25:39,089 --> 01:25:40,420
I'll be back in a while.
Okay?

875
01:25:40,591 --> 01:25:42,218
Where're you going?

876
01:25:42,392 --> 01:25:44,019
Don't go away!

877
01:25:44,094 --> 01:25:45,618
Wait a minute.
Where're you going?

878
01:27:31,101 --> 01:27:33,203
- Jake?
- Hey!

879
01:27:33,203 --> 01:27:34,534
I've got somethin' for you.
Here you are, Doreen.

880
01:27:34,705 --> 01:27:36,138
Thank you.

881
01:27:36,306 --> 01:27:37,739
Have a good one.

882
01:27:55,292 --> 01:27:56,623
Nah he didn't show up.

883
01:27:56,793 --> 01:27:58,624
No, not today.

884
01:28:00,397 --> 01:28:02,331
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, Doreen.

885
01:28:25,389 --> 01:28:27,016
Oh, I was... just looking for you.

886
01:28:27,090 --> 01:28:28,318
Howard.

887
01:28:28,492 --> 01:28:29,618
You look great.

888
01:28:29,793 --> 01:28:31,021
Ha! Thanks.

889
01:28:31,194 --> 01:28:34,220
Huh. Yellow.
I remember you in yellow.

890
01:28:34,398 --> 01:28:36,025
You always looked
good in yellow.

891
01:28:36,099 --> 01:28:39,330
I never wore yellow.
It must'a been someone else.

892
01:28:54,584 --> 01:28:56,415
What're you doing up so early?

893
01:28:56,586 --> 01:28:58,417
I never went to bed.

894
01:28:58,588 --> 01:29:01,022
Must have a lot
on your mind, huh?

895
01:29:01,191 --> 01:29:02,215
Yeah.

896
01:29:04,094 --> 01:29:05,118
You look awful.

897
01:29:05,295 --> 01:29:06,626
I suppose.

898
01:29:07,197 --> 01:29:09,631
So, how are you two
getting along? Any progress?

899
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,028
Who? Oh, you mean...

900
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:12,033
Your son, Howard.

901
01:29:12,102 --> 01:29:13,535
How are you getting along
with your son.

902
01:29:13,704 --> 01:29:15,535
It's hopeless, I think.

903
01:29:15,706 --> 01:29:18,038
Oh. You haven't given it much
of a shot, have you?

904
01:29:18,108 --> 01:29:20,201
In a couple days and you just...
what? Give up?

905
01:29:20,410 --> 01:29:22,173
- I haven't given up.
- No?

906
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:24,110
- No. I justrealized...
- What?

907
01:29:24,181 --> 01:29:27,014
That... it's you...
It's youl came up here for.

908
01:29:27,084 --> 01:29:28,711
It's you I wanted to see.

909
01:29:32,189 --> 01:29:33,622
What's so funny?

910
01:29:34,491 --> 01:29:36,618
Oh God.

911
01:29:37,694 --> 01:29:41,027
You're unbelievable, Howard.

912
01:29:41,098 --> 01:29:41,621
What do you mean?

913
01:29:41,698 --> 01:29:44,792
- Ooh! How many years has it been?
- What's that got to do with it?

914
01:29:44,901 --> 01:29:47,426
Everything!
It's got everything to do with it.

915
01:29:47,604 --> 01:29:50,232
When time goes by people.

916
01:29:50,307 --> 01:29:53,037
you know people slip away from
each other if they don't have contact.

917
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:56,008
Yeah, but I mean, we could.
Maybe get back together again!

918
01:29:56,079 --> 01:29:57,103
What are you out of your mind!

919
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:01,011
No. I mean there's no reason
we couldn't have some kind of a...

920
01:30:01,084 --> 01:30:02,517
- You know er...
- What?

921
01:30:02,686 --> 01:30:04,119
Reconciliation or something.

922
01:30:04,287 --> 01:30:05,413
- Reconciliation?
- Yeah.

923
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:08,214
Reconciliation!

924
01:30:08,392 --> 01:30:10,019
Now we've got lawyer talk!

925
01:30:10,193 --> 01:30:13,128
No. I mean you know, you know
we should've gotten married.

926
01:30:13,196 --> 01:30:14,026
We should have.
Don't you think?

927
01:30:14,097 --> 01:30:15,029
- Married?
- Yeah.

928
01:30:15,098 --> 01:30:16,030
- Married?
- Yeah.

929
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:17,223
I realize that now.

930
01:30:17,401 --> 01:30:19,028
That was my big mistake.

931
01:30:19,102 --> 01:30:22,037
We should have got married
and settled down right here...

932
01:30:22,105 --> 01:30:25,040
- I did settle down right here, Howard.
- Yeah. I know, but

933
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:28,609
Oh, stop it!
Just stop it!

934
01:30:28,779 --> 01:30:32,010
You're an absolute idiot, Howard!

935
01:30:32,082 --> 01:30:34,107
You come back here
supposedly wanting

936
01:30:34,284 --> 01:30:36,309
to meet up with
your abandoned son.

937
01:30:36,486 --> 01:30:38,716
I don't know why exactly.

938
01:30:38,889 --> 01:30:40,322
Maybe guilt.
Was that it?

939
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:45,018
Huh... to relieve yourself
of some kind of guilt?

940
01:30:45,195 --> 01:30:47,425
I don't know.
I don't care.

941
01:30:49,099 --> 01:30:51,226
But you know
it might have made...

942
01:30:54,704 --> 01:30:57,434
some little difference...

943
01:30:59,509 --> 01:31:02,103
in Earl's life.

944
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:06,010
And that would've been great.

945
01:31:08,285 --> 01:31:10,116
But now that probably
won't even happen

946
01:31:10,287 --> 01:31:15,020
because you're just too
gutless to see this thing through.

947
01:31:15,091 --> 01:31:18,026
You're a coward Howard.

948
01:31:19,796 --> 01:31:22,026
That rhymes, doesn't it?

949
01:31:22,899 --> 01:31:25,231
But you are,
you're a total coward.

950
01:31:25,402 --> 01:31:27,029
And now...

951
01:31:28,104 --> 01:31:31,335
now you wanna hide
and run away again, don't you?

952
01:31:31,508 --> 01:31:35,205
You wanna hide and
disappear into my life.

953
01:31:35,378 --> 01:31:39,007
You want me to give you cover,
don't you, Howard?

954
01:31:40,183 --> 01:31:41,207
No...

955
01:31:41,384 --> 01:31:43,409
Don't lie to me!
Lie to yourself!

956
01:31:43,587 --> 01:31:46,021
You just keep telling yourself

957
01:31:46,089 --> 01:31:48,421
that there is some remote
possibility

958
01:31:48,592 --> 01:31:53,620
that some pathetic woman
somewhere on this planet...

959
01:31:57,501 --> 01:32:00,026
is gonna take pity on you and

960
01:32:00,103 --> 01:32:04,039
save you from the truth.
But it's not me.

961
01:32:04,107 --> 01:32:08,009
I am not that woman and
I never will be.

962
01:33:23,787 --> 01:33:25,721
What if he actually
was your father?

963
01:33:25,889 --> 01:33:28,119
What's so out rage us about that?

964
01:33:28,291 --> 01:33:31,021
He just came to see you?
Like a friendly visit.

965
01:33:31,094 --> 01:33:33,119
I don't need a father!
It's too late for a father!

966
01:33:33,296 --> 01:33:34,627
You don't know that.

967
01:33:34,798 --> 01:33:36,129
Might be really nice
to have a father.

968
01:33:36,299 --> 01:33:38,028
- You don't know.
- Nice?

969
01:33:38,201 --> 01:33:39,725
Yeah. He could be
a really nice guy.

970
01:33:39,903 --> 01:33:42,531
He's not a nice guy!
He's a fucking jerk.

971
01:33:42,706 --> 01:33:45,641
Do you know? You just have
that in your head, Earlie.

972
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:48,007
Shut up, would you!

973
01:33:48,078 --> 01:33:50,512
What do you know
what's in my head?

974
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:54,013
You know you can't just go around
judging people like that all the time.

975
01:33:54,084 --> 01:33:57,019
- Yes, I can!
- No, you can't.

976
01:33:57,087 --> 01:34:00,022
You judge meall the time
and I'm not so bad.

977
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:02,217
You're terrible.

978
01:34:02,392 --> 01:34:06,328
You're like that stupid cricket
from Pinocchio.

979
01:34:07,097 --> 01:34:10,032
- What's Pinocchio?
- Oh, shut up.

980
01:34:12,502 --> 01:34:14,231
You know, you really
made a mess here, Earl.

981
01:34:14,404 --> 01:34:17,032
Yeah, he pissed me off.

982
01:34:18,108 --> 01:34:20,133
You musta' gone ballistic.

983
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:23,006
You threw all this out that window?

984
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,207
What're you looking for anyway?

985
01:34:27,283 --> 01:34:30,013
Aah! Found it!

986
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:35,014
How much power
does that thing have?

987
01:34:35,191 --> 01:34:36,522
Enough.

988
01:35:12,395 --> 01:35:16,024
You know...
you should really see what he wants.

989
01:35:16,099 --> 01:35:21,036
I mean, talk to him at least.
That can't hurt.

990
01:35:22,605 --> 01:35:26,041
See if he wants to give you
a gazillion dollars or something.

991
01:35:26,209 --> 01:35:28,006
You ever thought about that?

992
01:35:31,081 --> 01:35:32,207
Nope.

993
01:35:47,497 --> 01:35:51,228
- I have a question for you.
- Yes?

994
01:35:51,401 --> 01:35:53,335
How do you distinguish
between the 'Hash Browns',

995
01:35:53,503 --> 01:35:56,438
the 'Home Fries' and the 'Red Buds'?
I'm not familiar...

996
01:35:56,606 --> 01:36:00,133
Oh, well, there's
three different kinds of potatoes

997
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:02,210
that you can have
with your eggs.

998
01:36:02,378 --> 01:36:03,606
No, that's not my question.

999
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:07,307
What I'm trying to find out is
the difference between the three.

1000
01:36:07,484 --> 01:36:10,817
Oh! Sure.
I... I'm sorry, you know.

1001
01:36:10,887 --> 01:36:13,412
I was thinking about
something else.

1002
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:15,615
The 'Home Fries'

1003
01:36:15,692 --> 01:36:22,029
well, they are pretty much just your
regular ordinary old 'Home Fries',

1004
01:36:22,098 --> 01:36:27,331
the 'Hash Browns', those
are shredded and then fried in butter

1005
01:36:27,403 --> 01:36:32,136
and the 'Red Buds' we leave
the skins on them.

1006
01:36:32,709 --> 01:36:36,304
You just serve them
with the skins left on?

1007
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:38,003
- Is that right?
- Yes, that's right.

1008
01:36:38,081 --> 01:36:41,414
I... I mean, they're boiled
and everything.

1009
01:36:41,584 --> 01:36:45,520
- They're boiled?
- Yes, and... and then the uh,

1010
01:36:45,688 --> 01:36:50,421
Then the skin kind of
peels off them.

1011
01:36:50,593 --> 01:36:58,227
- It peels?
- Well, um, blisters kind of.

1012
01:37:00,503 --> 01:37:04,633
Can I have a glass
of water, please.

1013
01:37:04,808 --> 01:37:07,038
And thank you for your time.

1014
01:37:09,078 --> 01:37:12,104
Well, you're welcome.

1015
01:37:34,804 --> 01:37:36,431
Where's Howard?

1016
01:37:37,307 --> 01:37:39,537
- Who?
- Howard.

1017
01:37:39,709 --> 01:37:42,007
He was just sitting here
on this sofa.

1018
01:37:42,078 --> 01:37:46,014
Howard. You know
who I'm talking about.

1019
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:55,023
Where's Howard?

1020
01:37:55,892 --> 01:37:57,519
Where's Howard?

1021
01:37:58,595 --> 01:38:03,623
Earl! Earlie!

1022
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:07,429
There's somebody here.
Wants to know where is Howard.

1023
01:38:07,604 --> 01:38:09,538
Who's Howard?

1024
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:21,516
Where is Howard?
Who is Howard? We wanna know.

1025
01:38:21,684 --> 01:38:25,711
We wanna know.
Where is Howard? Who is Howard?

1026
01:38:25,889 --> 01:38:31,020
Where did he go? Where did he go?
He's down in the ditches.

1027
01:38:31,094 --> 01:38:33,528
He's down in the ground.

1028
01:38:33,696 --> 01:38:39,225
Disappeared himself.
He's nowhere to be found.

1029
01:38:39,402 --> 01:38:42,132
Where is Howard?
Who is Howard?

1030
01:38:42,205 --> 01:38:45,333
He's long gone.
He's long gone.

1031
01:38:56,786 --> 01:39:00,517
- Hey, you got fifty bucks?
- What? No.

1032
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:02,214
Yeah, you gotta have fifty bucks.

1033
01:39:02,392 --> 01:39:04,724
No. No. Look, look.
I'm... I'm just...

1034
01:39:04,894 --> 01:39:08,022
I... I'm just heading out of town here.
I... need to get out of town.

1035
01:39:08,197 --> 01:39:10,324
Had enough of
beautiful uptown Butte?

1036
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:11,524
Yeah.

1037
01:39:12,402 --> 01:39:14,529
You gotta leave a little money behind.
Bolster the economy.

1038
01:39:14,604 --> 01:39:16,538
- Now, look...
- You gotta' have fifty bucks.

1039
01:39:16,706 --> 01:39:21,006
Ah, all I got is a dollar.
How about a dollar?

1040
01:39:21,077 --> 01:39:23,011
That be all right? A dollar?
Here is a dollar.

1041
01:39:23,179 --> 01:39:24,407
- A dollar!
- Yes.

1042
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,004
What?
Do I look like a welfare bum?

1043
01:39:26,082 --> 01:39:28,414
Do I look like a tragic case?
Do I look tragic?

1044
01:39:28,584 --> 01:39:30,017
Look at you.

1045
01:39:30,186 --> 01:39:34,020
Look. Here, take it.
Take it.

1046
01:39:34,190 --> 01:39:36,624
Would you let me
get to my car, please?

1047
01:39:37,193 --> 01:39:39,024
- This is your car?
- Yeah, that is my car.

1048
01:39:39,095 --> 01:39:43,327
Oh, you bet. So sorry.
I didn't know this was your car.

1049
01:39:43,499 --> 01:39:45,023
Thanks a lot.

1050
01:39:45,101 --> 01:39:46,033
Thank you.

1051
01:39:53,609 --> 01:39:55,008
What are you? Crazy!

1052
01:39:55,078 --> 01:39:56,705
Are you nuts!

1053
01:39:56,879 --> 01:39:58,210
What are you doing?

1054
01:39:58,381 --> 01:39:59,313
What's wrong with you?

1055
01:39:59,382 --> 01:40:02,613
Look! Look!
Take... Take this... Take all this.

1056
01:40:02,685 --> 01:40:03,617
Okay?
That's all I've got!

1057
01:40:03,786 --> 01:40:06,118
Take that! Okay?
Just take it!

1058
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:08,716
Push it!

1059
01:40:09,492 --> 01:40:11,119
- You need some help?
- No.

1060
01:40:11,294 --> 01:40:13,728
Yes, we do!
We do need help.

1061
01:40:13,896 --> 01:40:16,626
Why can't you admit it.
We need help!

1062
01:40:16,799 --> 01:40:19,029
You just stay over there
on that sofa

1063
01:40:19,102 --> 01:40:20,433
and wait for...
whoever it is.

1064
01:40:20,603 --> 01:40:22,036
You know who it is.

1065
01:40:23,306 --> 01:40:25,536
Why do you keep pretending
you don't know who it is?

1066
01:40:26,509 --> 01:40:30,001
Who? Who?
What? "Howard"?

1067
01:40:30,079 --> 01:40:32,104
Is that the guy
that was following us? The narc?

1068
01:40:32,281 --> 01:40:37,116
Yeah. He knows
He knows it's his father.

1069
01:40:37,286 --> 01:40:39,618
He knows whose...
whose father!

1070
01:40:44,093 --> 01:40:46,027
He's not my father!

1071
01:40:47,397 --> 01:40:48,625
Yeah. He is.

1072
01:40:50,099 --> 01:40:51,532
He told me he'd be here.

1073
01:40:53,102 --> 01:40:55,036
He told me he'd wait for me.

1074
01:41:01,778 --> 01:41:06,511
Reliable.
Isn't he the reliable type?

1075
01:41:07,884 --> 01:41:11,217
You know there was a time
that I was curious about him.

1076
01:41:11,387 --> 01:41:13,014
Long time ago.

1077
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:16,224
I don't remember
how young I was.

1078
01:41:20,096 --> 01:41:23,725
There was a hole
something missing.

1079
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:26,425
I went around trying to fill it.
If elt...

1080
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:32,640
desperate, like
I couldn't breathe sometimes,

1081
01:41:32,809 --> 01:41:38,406
like I was...
falling and I had to catch myself.

1082
01:41:38,581 --> 01:41:41,015
Like I couldn't stop falling.

1083
01:41:45,188 --> 01:41:47,019
Then one day, then...

1084
01:41:50,293 --> 01:41:52,124
it just came to an end.

1085
01:41:53,096 --> 01:41:54,620
It just stopped.

1086
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:01,730
And I don't ever
wanna go back to that falling...

1087
01:42:03,506 --> 01:42:05,633
I don't wanna ever go back.

1088
01:42:56,492 --> 01:42:59,017
I have something for you,
Mr. Spence.

1089
01:43:03,599 --> 01:43:05,226
This is to inform you that
your presence is required

1090
01:43:05,301 --> 01:43:08,031
by law of California state court
to appear in the motion picture

1091
01:43:08,104 --> 01:43:11,232
titled "Phantom of the west"
currently shooting in Moab,

1092
01:43:11,307 --> 01:43:13,434
Utah or face the consequences.

1093
01:43:14,577 --> 01:43:16,101
You understand
what I'm saying to you?

1094
01:43:16,279 --> 01:43:20,010
You are obliged by law
to fulfill your contract.

1095
01:43:20,082 --> 01:43:22,016
Yeah... Obliged. Yeah.

1096
01:43:22,084 --> 01:43:23,016
Could you step out
of the car, please?

1097
01:43:23,085 --> 01:43:24,575
Now wait a minute.
I understand but...

1098
01:43:24,687 --> 01:43:27,417
- You know... I... wait.
- Could you come out of the car.

1099
01:43:27,590 --> 01:43:29,421
- That's it. That's it.
- All right. All right.

1100
01:43:29,592 --> 01:43:32,117
Now. If you could just
give me your... arm?

1101
01:43:32,295 --> 01:43:34,024
No. This is not necessary,
I'm not gonna run or anything...

1102
01:43:34,197 --> 01:43:37,030
I understand.
No, I understand, Mr. Spence.

1103
01:43:37,099 --> 01:43:39,124
I'm just wondering if maybe
you could give me a little more time...

1104
01:43:39,302 --> 01:43:41,031
- Time?
- Yeah.

1105
01:43:41,204 --> 01:43:43,035
Time for what?
You've had plenty of time.

1106
01:43:43,105 --> 01:43:45,630
Well no, no. I just discovered
that I got some family here in town.

1107
01:43:45,808 --> 01:43:47,105
- Family?
- Yeah. I've just found them.

1108
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:50,006
I've just been tracking them down
from a long, long time ago.

1109
01:43:50,079 --> 01:43:52,013
- I see.
- Yeah and I... I just...

1110
01:43:52,081 --> 01:43:54,015
I need to say good-bye
to my children.

1111
01:43:54,083 --> 01:43:56,017
- I... I owe it to 'em.
- Your children?

1112
01:43:56,085 --> 01:43:58,019
- Yes.
- Where are your children?

1113
01:43:58,087 --> 01:44:00,021
Well, I can show you.

1114
01:44:01,591 --> 01:44:04,822
I mean this used to be a boom town.
Can you believe that? I used to know my way...

1115
01:44:04,894 --> 01:44:08,421
ah, here it is.
This is it. Right here.

1116
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:12,124
Hi!

1117
01:44:13,102 --> 01:44:14,228
I thought you
were gonna wait for me?

1118
01:44:14,403 --> 01:44:17,236
Well, I was.
But then you gave me an idea.

1119
01:44:17,406 --> 01:44:18,430
An idea about what?

1120
01:44:18,608 --> 01:44:22,601
Um... Home, remember?
excuse me...

1121
01:44:22,778 --> 01:44:25,212
This is... ah,
my daughter, I guess.

1122
01:44:25,381 --> 01:44:27,713
- What's your name, honey?
- My name's Sky.

1123
01:44:27,883 --> 01:44:30,317
- Glad to meet you.
- Sutter. It's a pleasure.

1124
01:44:30,486 --> 01:44:33,011
- He's a detective, sort of.
- No, I'm not a detective.

1125
01:44:33,189 --> 01:44:34,213
- Oh...
- Well, security, I guess.

1126
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:36,119
I have nothing to do
with security.

1127
01:44:36,292 --> 01:44:37,623
Are you in some kind of
trouble Howard?

1128
01:44:37,793 --> 01:44:40,227
- No.
- He's in deep trouble.

1129
01:44:40,396 --> 01:44:42,330
Hey is that
"Howard" down there!

1130
01:44:42,498 --> 01:44:46,127
You finally showed up?
Hey!

1131
01:44:46,302 --> 01:44:47,633
What're you doing
back here again?

1132
01:44:47,803 --> 01:44:49,737
- Who's that?
- You never give up, do you!

1133
01:44:49,905 --> 01:44:51,634
That's my son.

1134
01:44:51,807 --> 01:44:53,331
- I wanna meet him.
- No!

1135
01:44:55,077 --> 01:44:57,011
- Let me go!
- I'm doing you a favor, Mr. Spence,

1136
01:44:57,079 --> 01:44:59,411
so let's get this over with.
I don't have all day.

1137
01:44:59,582 --> 01:45:01,015
Have you arrested him
for something?

1138
01:45:01,183 --> 01:45:02,115
He's not arrested. No.

1139
01:45:02,285 --> 01:45:03,217
Why is he handcuffed to you?

1140
01:45:03,386 --> 01:45:05,513
- It's just a formality.
- It's just a formality.

1141
01:45:05,688 --> 01:45:08,418
- You're a cop?
- I am not a cop, no.

1142
01:45:08,591 --> 01:45:11,719
Amber, get you ass back!
Come back here.

1143
01:45:11,894 --> 01:45:13,020
- Is that him for real?
- Who's this now?

1144
01:45:13,095 --> 01:45:15,222
- Is that Earl's father?
- I have no idea.

1145
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:21,131
Man, you don't look
a thing like Earlie.

1146
01:45:21,304 --> 01:45:22,430
Are you sure
you're not lying?

1147
01:45:22,605 --> 01:45:24,038
- Stand back, please!
- Hey!

1148
01:45:24,106 --> 01:45:24,731
Step away from him!

1149
01:45:24,907 --> 01:45:26,135
Mr. Spence is in breach
of contract

1150
01:45:26,309 --> 01:45:28,504
and I am responsible for returning
him to the injured parties.

1151
01:45:28,678 --> 01:45:30,009
Is he a criminal?

1152
01:45:30,179 --> 01:45:32,306
- Is your daddy a criminal Earlie?
- Shut up.

1153
01:45:32,481 --> 01:45:34,312
If you'd like to say good-bye
to your father, now.

1154
01:45:34,483 --> 01:45:36,508
He's not my father.
He's nobody's father!

1155
01:45:36,686 --> 01:45:37,618
- He's my father.
- let's go.

1156
01:45:37,787 --> 01:45:40,722
- Oh, shit. I'm going backup stairs.
- What's the rush. Come on.

1157
01:45:40,890 --> 01:45:42,517
No, you're not!
You're coming with me.

1158
01:45:42,692 --> 01:45:44,717
I've gotta go now.
Let go of me.

1159
01:45:44,894 --> 01:45:45,622
I've gotta tell
you something.

1160
01:45:45,795 --> 01:45:46,727
I want to hear
what they say!

1161
01:45:46,896 --> 01:45:49,330
I need to tell you this
before you leave again.

1162
01:45:51,901 --> 01:45:54,233
I used to wonder
about you all the time.

1163
01:45:56,806 --> 01:45:59,036
I studied your pictures.

1164
01:46:00,109 --> 01:46:02,009
Photographs.

1165
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:06,514
I would stare at them for hours.

1166
01:46:07,683 --> 01:46:11,414
I'd run my fingers over
your face, tracing the bones.

1167
01:46:13,089 --> 01:46:16,422
Study your hands under
a magnifying glass.

1168
01:46:16,592 --> 01:46:20,722
Looking for veins
and knuckles...

1169
01:46:22,498 --> 01:46:24,329
and... some clue.

1170
01:46:28,104 --> 01:46:30,538
I'd stare at my own face
in the mirror...

1171
01:46:32,308 --> 01:46:36,711
Wondering.
Watching.

1172
01:46:39,582 --> 01:46:41,607
Hunting for some...

1173
01:46:42,485 --> 01:46:45,010
some tiny twitch of the eye,

1174
01:46:47,089 --> 01:46:49,023
some wrinkle of the lip.

1175
01:46:52,895 --> 01:46:56,023
Anything that might suddenly
give the whole thing away.

1176
01:47:01,804 --> 01:47:03,738
Never revealed itself.

1177
01:47:07,777 --> 01:47:09,506
It was always something...

1178
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:13,011
half-way hidden.

1179
01:47:17,386 --> 01:47:19,013
Now you're here.

1180
01:47:22,892 --> 01:47:25,122
You're right here
in front of me.

1181
01:47:28,597 --> 01:47:30,622
Standing right here.

1182
01:47:34,403 --> 01:47:36,030
I'm still not sure.

1183
01:47:40,376 --> 01:47:42,105
Why is that?

1184
01:47:45,681 --> 01:47:47,410
How could that be?

1185
01:48:00,196 --> 01:48:02,130
Say good-bye, Mr. Spence.
Time's up.

1186
01:48:02,298 --> 01:48:04,027
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

1187
01:48:13,709 --> 01:48:15,006
Howard!

1188
01:48:20,483 --> 01:48:22,417
Could you use a car?

1189
01:48:22,585 --> 01:48:26,521
It's a good one.
Belonged to your grandfather.

1190
01:48:40,603 --> 01:48:43,128
- This is my call sheet, huh?
- Yes, it is.

1191
01:48:43,305 --> 01:48:45,432
Make-Up and Hair at 8.00.

1192
01:48:45,608 --> 01:48:48,008
Costume at 9.15.
On the set by 10.

1193
01:48:48,177 --> 01:48:52,307
Everything's structured.
Nothing left to chance.

1194
01:48:52,481 --> 01:48:54,005
You think we'll make it?

1195
01:48:55,484 --> 01:48:56,712
We'll make it.

1196
01:48:57,586 --> 01:48:58,518
You know,
I can drive if you want.

1197
01:48:58,687 --> 01:49:01,019
if you want to take
a break or something.

1198
01:49:01,190 --> 01:49:04,023
I like to drive.
I love to drive.

1199
01:49:04,693 --> 01:49:06,024
If you want.

1200
01:49:07,396 --> 01:49:10,126
I had a great car
for a while.

1201
01:49:12,201 --> 01:49:14,431
Do you have a family,
Mr.Sutter?

1202
01:49:15,404 --> 01:49:17,736
No. No, I don't.

1203
01:49:17,907 --> 01:49:20,535
I don't need a family.
Some people do, I'm not one of them.

1204
01:49:21,877 --> 01:49:24,004
Do you mind if I turn
the radio on?

1205
01:49:24,079 --> 01:49:30,609
Yes, I do as a matter of fact.
I don't like outside influence.

1206
01:49:30,786 --> 01:49:34,017
- Outside?
- That's right.

1207
01:49:34,089 --> 01:49:37,718
The world at large.
It's a nasty place.

1208
01:49:37,893 --> 01:49:42,626
Why allow it in?
Livestock reports.

1209
01:49:42,798 --> 01:49:45,426
Nava jochanting.

1210
01:49:45,601 --> 01:49:49,128
Beheadings.
Bestiality.

1211
01:49:49,305 --> 01:49:51,034
Nothing's changed.

1212
01:49:52,908 --> 01:49:54,705
Black Death.

1213
01:49:56,078 --> 01:49:57,602
The Inquisition.

1214
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:02,714
Crusades.
The Conquest of Mexico.

1215
01:50:02,885 --> 01:50:06,013
- What's changed?
- I was thinking...

1216
01:50:07,289 --> 01:50:09,723
- What?
- I don't know...

1217
01:50:11,694 --> 01:50:15,027
- Nothing's changed.
- I guess not.

1218
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:20,330
- We need gas.
- Yeah.

1219
01:50:22,304 --> 01:50:24,135
I gotta pull up over there.

1220
01:50:26,208 --> 01:50:27,197
Done.

1221
01:50:30,179 --> 01:50:33,205
Don't cry, Belinda.
Please, don't cry.

1222
01:50:33,382 --> 01:50:36,112
The Staked Plains is just
no place for a woman

1223
01:50:36,285 --> 01:50:39,721
and the Comanche are
thick as flies.

1224
01:50:39,888 --> 01:50:42,516
Oh, Johnny.
I won't get in your way.

1225
01:50:42,691 --> 01:50:45,421
Please, please take me
with you.

1226
01:50:45,594 --> 01:50:49,325
I'll be back for you.
You know I will always come back.

1227
01:50:49,498 --> 01:50:51,022
But how long, Johnny?

1228
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:54,228
How long this time?
I can't wait forever.

1229
01:50:54,403 --> 01:50:56,428
Before the snow flies.

1230
01:50:57,706 --> 01:51:02,006
Oh, Johnny don't forget me.

1231
01:51:02,177 --> 01:51:04,407
You're alwaysin my heart,
Belinda.

1232
01:51:15,090 --> 01:51:16,717
You always will be.

1233
01:51:36,378 --> 01:51:39,108
Where is Howard?
Who is Howard?

1234
01:51:39,181 --> 01:51:40,614
Where did he go?

1235
01:51:40,683 --> 01:51:44,312
Where did he go?
He's down in the ditches.

1236
01:51:44,486 --> 01:51:47,011
He's down in the ground.

1237
01:51:47,189 --> 01:51:52,627
Disappeared himself.
He's nowhere to be found.

1238
01:51:52,795 --> 01:51:55,525
Where is Howard?
Who is Howard?

1239
01:51:55,597 --> 01:51:56,825
Where did he go?

1240
01:51:56,899 --> 01:52:00,232
Where did he go?
He's down in the ditches.

1241
01:52:00,402 --> 01:52:03,030
He's down in the ground.

1242
01:52:03,105 --> 01:52:08,099
Disappeared himself.
He's nowhere to be, and found.

1243
01:52:08,377 --> 01:52:11,005
Where is Howard?
Who is Howard?

1244
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:13,605
We wanna know...
