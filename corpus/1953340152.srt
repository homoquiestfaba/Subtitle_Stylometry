1
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:25,580
Excuse me? Excuse me?
Is it train late?

2
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,700
- Hi, I'm here for a temp job.
- Mr. Mahoney was in the hallway.

3
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:18,090
- Excuse me, are you Mr. Mahoney?
- Yeah.

4
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:22,762
Hi, my name is Janice ..
The temp From 'Permanent Temps'

5
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,726
- Sorry I'm late. The train was...
- What size jacket then?

6
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:32,980
- Ahhh... Small.
- Small says the late girl.

7
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,538
You could put that on.

8
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:56,170
Okay... See this door? The lock is broken.
Want stay locked.

9
00:04:56,254 --> 00:05:01,092
On the matter, there's nothing inside
but an empty closet, see that?

10
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:04,178
Yeah.

11
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:11,185
Empty. But maintenance can't fix it until tomorrow.
So, I need you to stand here.

12
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,689
Well, if anybody comes down here, anybody gets lost,
and starts wondering around,

13
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:18,317
- I need you to make sure they don't open this door.
- Okay.

14
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:23,281
- Like a guard dog, you block them. Got it?
- Yeah.

15
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:29,871
- The jacket is way too big.
- I know.
- Way too big.

16
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:34,166
If you got here on time, you could get a smaller size.
The smalls are the first to go.

17
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,920
- I apologize.
- That doesn't matter.

18
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:40,548
Nobody comes down here anyway

19
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:46,262
Get to work!

20
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:03,946
O, ticket one, please.

21
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,937
- Hello?
- You're late.

22
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:41,651
- For what?
- Tim?! We said no stilts inside.

23
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,571
- Late for what?
- For my work party.

24
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,659
- You didn't say anything about the work party.
- Yes, I did.

25
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:54,580
- Do I have to go?
- Yes

26
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,710
Shit!

27
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:07,176
I told you, it is going to be in suits. What did I say?
Can you at least take the hat off?

28
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,348
Hi, .. heh.

29
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,603
- I have a bonus.
- Really? Again?

30
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:22,024
S-Class 500, black, leather,
Fully loaded.

31
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,653
Great. Beautiful car.

32
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:31,617
- May I ask for a whiskey, please?
- See who just ---- to the party.

33
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:36,747
- I got a new plasma TV,
- How many inches?
- 50-inch, Full HD, surround everything.

34
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:42,295
- You watch porn on it?
- Oh, hey dude, when I was watching this one

35
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:46,966
This bitch is wearing this little bikini, and a zit on her ass is like this big.
In High Def? So raunchy.

36
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:52,972
- Hey man, there's a lady right here, so?
- OK, buddy.

37
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:57,059
- So the 50-inch size, how much that costs you?
- Like 3 grand.
- Not bad...

38
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:03,149
- You're kidding, right?
- Excuse me?
- 3000 dollars for TV? Ever heard about books?

39
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:07,778
- No, we did not have those at Harvard.
- Tim, can we talk for a second?

40
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,490
- Pauline, who is this guy?
- He was joking. Sorry.

41
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,452
No, I'm not kidding.

42
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,747
- Hey, what's that on your neck? What is the makeup?
- Yes, makeup, silver makeup.

43
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,043
- The dude wears makeup.
- Bye bye.

44
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,381
We need to have a talk, Janice.

45
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:34,096
- About what?
- Honestly, I don't think this is working out too well.

46
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,725
- What do you mean?
- We got a lot of complaints about you.

47
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:42,230
- What kind of complaints?
- Just complaints, people who are not happy.

48
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:48,569
Do you want me to read you some?
Let's see...

49
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,659
"She seems distracted and disinterested".

50
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,745
"Her heart is not in it and her head in the clouds."

51
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:04,460
"Sometimes she reminds me of a speak and spell."
Do you have any idea that that means?

52
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:11,592
It does not matter. The point is we pride ourselves here on reputation
for smart, reliable and hardworking temps, ok?

53
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:15,513
- I am reliable, George.
- Hang on, let me finish.

54
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:22,228
You're reliable. And yes, you are a nice person,
but you do not personable.

55
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,523
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

56
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:31,279
- Have you ever seen "Three's Company"?
- The TV show?

57
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,825
You know Janet, the roommate?
She is an example of what I'm talking about.

58
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:41,289
She has a lot of charisma.
I mean, people want to see her again and again.

59
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,917
That's why show is lasted so long
I mean, I watched it every night.

60
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:53,342
So that you saying is that you want me to be more like
Janet from "Three's Company"?

61
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:59,098
I mean I'm saying that, but I'm not really saying that.
Because that I'm really saying is, you know, you're fired.

62
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,478
That's what I'm actually saying.
You're fired.

63
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,692
Ok.

64
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:31,542
Hi, I' m calling about the job listening in a paper today. Really?

65
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,420
Okay, thank you.

66
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:48,559
- Hello, Janice. Got a second?
- Sure, Craig.

67
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,648
- The rent is due on the first.
- I know.

68
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:58,319
Really? Because your rent is usually arrives in my box around the 20th,
 and that won't work.

69
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:03,032
- I know, I'm sorry, Craig. I'm trying.
- Look, times are tough .. I get it, ok ..

70
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:07,036
.. but there are certain facts of live we all have to live by.

71
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:11,499
Why is the rent due on the first day of the month?
Bits me, it's just work out that way, you know?

72
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:15,127
Someone invented months and someone invented rent.

73
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:19,257
And then someone decided that rent is due on the first day of that month.

74
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:26,681
- Sorry that sounds harsh.
- No, I understand... I'll figured it out.

75
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,811
- Thank you.
- Okay

76
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,736
There.

77
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:56,586
Hi, I'm Hal Baker, I have a segment on night news called
"Man on the street".

78
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:04,093
Anyway
I'm wondering if you be interested in being interviewed?

79
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:12,310
Hello? Ah, right...
Give him some money.

80
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,149
Interested?

81
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,992
Okay, here, give me a call.
Thanks.

82
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:36,542
Hey, I got some good news.
Okay, listen to this,

83
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:41,756
Today this guy, I'm downtown .. slow day ..
It is not important ..

84
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,719
The point is I'm gonna be on TV.

85
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:54,060
Did you hear me? I'm gonna be on the TV show,
I'm gonna be on a TV show.

86
00:14:54,143 --> 00:15:01,067
- I thought you hate TV.
- Yes, I do, but not this kind.

87
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:06,113
- What kind?
- This is education, is on the news.

88
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:09,283
- Okay.
- Wow.

89
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:17,250
I'm trying to contain your enthusiasm, Pauline.

90
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:28,678
- What's up, Mark?
- Tim, you all silver.

91
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:33,182
I'll be right there.

92
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,858
What your brother doing here?

93
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,195
I'm leaving you, Tim.

94
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:51,826
- What? Are you coming back?
- No

95
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:56,497
You leaving?
Where is your suitcase?

96
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:02,545
- I do not need a suitcase. This is not a movie.
- I do not understand.

97
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:07,300
I'm seek of it, Tim I'm seek of the robot.

98
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:13,222
- I'm seek of the struggle.
- This again. The struggle is a part of the art, Pauline.

99
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:19,103
- Van Gogh never sold a painting.
- Tim, you're not a Van Gogh, okay?

100
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:27,361
I'm not saying I am an artist,
but people called me an artist.

101
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,243
You know what?
I do need a suitcase.

102
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,622
If it looks like a duck and
it acts like a duck, then it is a duck.

103
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,541
- What's a duck?
- I am a duck.
- What are you talking about?

104
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,128
If it's quack, has wet feet and feathers
then it is a duck.

105
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:49,842
- What are you talking about? - I'm talking about me.
- But I'm not see, I'm talking about us.

106
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,513
I'm talking about leaving and you
talking about ducks.

107
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:59,435
- Because I thought you believed in me.
- I never believed in you, Tim.
I just thought it was charming.

108
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,780
I'll be in my car.

109
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,706
- Hey ..
- What a hell is going on out there?

110
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:28,256
Can I give you some advice, man to man,
Do you mind?
Because I really like you.

111
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:33,344
But you know that I see when I looked at you?
You are 30-something, you poor,

112
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:37,557
my sister is leaving you,
you got no real future to speak up

113
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,311
And you know why that is?
Look, I will tell you why that is.

114
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:46,816
Because people are not live like this

115
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,278
Painted like a metal guy.

116
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:56,033
There's a reason the entire population
gets up in the morning and clocks the freeways,
 because they gotta go to work.

117
00:17:56,117 --> 00:18:00,371
That is a part of life and always has been.
You are a farmer.

118
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:07,044
Whether you like it or not, you're a farmer
and you have got to plow the fields.

119
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:11,048
- What fields?
- You know what I saying.

120
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,222
You think I want to sit behind a desk,
in a little room and push a pencil around the papers all day?

121
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:22,852
Hell no! But I do it.
Why?

122
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:30,443
You know the song by The Little River Band,
'Have your heard about the lonesome loser"?

123
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:37,074
- Great song.
- Well, Tim, if you're not careful, I gonna end like the guy in that song.

124
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:40,912
You are a farmer who plowed the fields.

125
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:21,577
- Hello?
- Where are you, Janice?
- Hi, Jill.

126
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:28,334
Are you coming over? Hold on, hold on...
I know. We run out of dip.

127
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,171
- Janice? - Yes
- Did you hear me? I say we run out of dip.

128
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:37,301
- I didn't know you're talking to me.
- What?
- I said I did not know you are talking to me!

129
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:41,097
- What does that mean?
- I thought you are talking to someone else at the party.

130
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:47,019
- I'm talking to you, I called you, Janice.
- No, I know, but...
- Jesus Christ, Janice. Are you even listening?

131
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,898
We ran out of sauce for the chips
We have no more dip!

132
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:55,319
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry, just bring some more dip.

133
00:19:55,403 --> 00:20:00,783
- I'll pay you back, do not worry, you're coming, right? Jenice?
- Yes, I'm coming!

134
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,536
Great, okay, just bring some more dip, and I will...

135
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:18,009
- Why did you ring the door bell?
- I do not know.

136
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,428
So weird. Just walk in.

137
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:24,015
- You bring the dip?
- Yes
- Hi, Janice.

138
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:28,978
- Honey, you have got to come to listen to the Larry story.
- Okay, will be there in a minute.
- Hi Brian.

139
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:35,818
- I want you to meet someone.
- What? No, I do not want to ..

140
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:41,574
- I wasn't planning to stay, because I'm not feeling right.
- You fine.
- No, I'm really...

141
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,455
- All right, let's go.
- No, I'm not feeling well...

142
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:51,000
- Just take off your jacket.
- Stop it!

143
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:55,671
Doug, this is my sister I was telling you about.

144
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,383
- Hi, Jill sister.
- All right, you two have fun.

145
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:03,638
- Hi, I'm Doug Duncan.
- Hi, I'm Janice.

146
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:07,683
That's a really pretty sweater that you have on.
Is that wool?

147
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:12,730
- I do not know.
- Feels like wool.

148
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:18,152
- Is it itchy? - Not really.
- I've got once a wool sweater, it was really itchy.

149
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:23,491
I almost wear it when I was flying to London
First class, for book signing.

150
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:28,829
- I am a author.
- Oh, okay.
- Well, I guess they flew first class for this sort of thing, you know...

151
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:33,709
But I am lucky I'm not wear this sweater because
when I got there right from the airport

152
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:38,172
to a live interview at the BBC.

153
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:43,219
- It's the British Broadcasting Company.
- Right.

154
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:49,350
- Anyway, what do you do?
- I .. I do not know really how to answer ..

155
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:54,105
Corporation, sorry.
British Broadcasting Corporation. I always do that.

156
00:21:54,188 --> 00:22:00,152
But it was tough, you know, it was like 3 hours, and if had I worn the wool sweater.
I'd be like, you know, itchy much.

157
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:06,492
But this is serious, you can't be itchy on camera
It's like the big no-no.

158
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:11,205
Do you have any hobbies? One of my hobbies is
helping kids.

159
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:14,041
Blind kids, build a church.

160
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:17,587
Residents on the southern side is find themselves knee deep in sewage

161
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,382
after a pipe broke near the corner of
Washington Boulevard and Main Street

162
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,760
Officials shut down the Washington corner
to fix the problem.

163
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,472
And we were told that construction could keep
the road closed through the New Year.

164
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:34,187
That gonna make a rough for some of our commuters.
But let's hear Hal Baker, our Man on the street.

165
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,524
- To actually is on the street today.He's in the studio, Hal?
- That's right, John. Thank you.

166
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:44,739
Some of you may have seen my next guest out on the street
some afternoon and wondered "Who, the heck, is that guy?"

167
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:50,536
We're here to find out. His name is Tim Tucker
And he is known as the "The Giant Mechanical Man"

168
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,457
- Hi, Tim
- Hi.
- That quiet a nice outfit you got there.

169
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,085
Thanks, I have sort of refinding it over the years.

170
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:03,424
That brings me to my first question.
Why did you choose to start doing this robot thing?

171
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:08,596
Why I choose to do it . This is happens to be my talent.

172
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,600
- Interesting.
- And I feel like...

173
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:17,480
And also maybe the people would, you know,
brighten people's life up.

174
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:24,570
- What do you mean?
- I guess, I think that modern life can be an alienating.

175
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:30,243
And It can be like you mindlessly
walking through it, like a robot.

176
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:33,204
And you can feel lost.

177
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:37,458
I guess I just want people to know that they are not crazy, okay?

178
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:44,423
Everybody at home, everybody watching the show today,
you're not crazy, I mean life is crazy, right?

179
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:49,720
Maybe if you see A Giant Mechanical Man, you know,
 wondering down the street, towards you.

180
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:55,601
Maybe that could put it in perspective everything.

181
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,733
- You know?
- You know that could be good for your routine? Break-dancing.
- Break-dancing?

182
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:06,362
Like the wave. Can you do the wave?

183
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:11,993
- No, I don't do that. I don't do the wave.
- You know what I mean, the wave.

184
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:17,790
- Yes, I know what that is, I just don't do it.
- Right. Right. Do you know the moonwalk?

185
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,214
Here it goes.

186
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:31,262
That is not what I'm trying to say.
I am not do that sort of stuff, the wave, the moonwalk.
I'm not that kind of...

187
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,515
Are you sure? That's fun!

188
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,477
Alright. Are we done?

189
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:15,556
- Hello?
- Hi, Jill. Listen, I need a place to stay for a little while.

190
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:18,851
- Why? Do you get evicted or something?
- Yeah, I might...

191
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:23,940
- Might? Where are you calling from?
- I phone a pay phone.

192
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,568
I've been trying to call you.
What happen to your sell phone?

193
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:31,405
- It got turned off.
- What? How did that happen?

194
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:35,660
- I'm just...I'm having hard time right now, Jill.
- What's the matter, Janice?

195
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:42,124
- I just need a place to stay for a while, okay?
- Yeah. okay. That's fine. You can stay here. We come pick you tomorrow.

196
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,585
Okay, thanks.

197
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:12,196
Hi, I saw you on television.

198
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:18,244
Hi, I saw you on television.

199
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:41,309
I feel like 'those people' you're talking about.

200
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:49,066
Like I was just born into this life and
 I supposed to know that I'm doing.

201
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:56,449
Like I'm supposed to have it all figured it out.
But I don't have it all figured it out.

202
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:03,039
I just feel lost.

203
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:10,838
Anyway, thanks.

204
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:32,693
Oh God, did you guys know that Bianca Jones and Lee
Dermot broke up?

205
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:45,957
Oh God, you know who else is breaking up?

206
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,085
Joe Lorrie and Ashley Seib.

207
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:00,721
Okay.

208
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:04,308
I'm gonna get more coffee.

209
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:15,278
So, we have something for you.
A little welcome gift, I guess.

210
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:20,449
- I think, you are really going to like it.
- Oh my God, it's like the coolest gift ever.

211
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:24,287
- What is it?
- It's something that is one of the kind.

212
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,207
- Totally, totally unique.
- Wow, what's it?

213
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,710
- Guess.
- What?

214
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:36,299
- Guess. I mean you will never guess, but just try to guess.
- Okay, while you want me to guess...

215
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:43,472
- Is it a hat?
- A hat?

216
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:48,269
- I do not know.
- It is definitely not a hat.

217
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:53,107
- Why did you guess that? Why?
- I do not know, you said to guess...

218
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:58,988
No really, I mean, Janice. Please, once, for once in your
 life just take yourself seriously, alright?

219
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,074
Your life is upside down and is in shambles
and you guess a hat?

220
00:29:02,158 --> 00:29:06,120
- I'm taking it seriously.
- Maybe we need just give it to her.

221
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:09,207
- Fine. just give it to her.
- Close your eyes.

222
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,544
Alright.

223
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:18,174
It is this.

224
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:23,429
- Oh, it's a book.
- Yes, Doug Duncan. Remember him from the party?

225
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:26,974
- Yes.
- I clean his teeth, Janice.

226
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:31,229
He want us to give it to you.
And he even sign it on the inside. Open it!

227
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:34,148
What is this say?

228
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:39,445
"Dear Janice, how about we discuss over dinner? Doug Duncan".

229
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:42,490
- Isn't that awesome?
- You should definitely go out with him, Janice.
- Absolutely.

230
00:29:42,573 --> 00:29:49,205
I mean this is the answer, you know? He's amazing. He'll teach you how to talk, because sometimes nobody get it that.

231
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,374
Thank you.

232
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:34,435
- Well, I have got an opening in sanitation.
- Sanitation?

233
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:40,399
Yeah. it's pretty simple. You just clean up the cages, take out the trash, kid drops his popcorn, you clean it up.

234
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:44,111
- Does it bother you?
- No, I'm used to it.

235
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:48,115
Good, the other downside is that you'll need to clean the toilets too.

236
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:54,163
That's all is clean the toilets, at this point.

237
00:31:54,413 --> 00:32:00,086
I'm sorry to heard that. Okay, then, why don't we just get you your uniform, give you a broom, and you'll be on your way.

238
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:06,634
- Okay.
- Well, it's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

239
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,655
Excuse me?

240
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:35,329
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

241
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:41,252
- You work here?
- Do I work here?

242
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:43,921
No, I'm trapped here.

243
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:48,259
- What?
- Miserable human being.

244
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:51,596
That's that they call us exhibit.

245
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:57,894
- I'm looking for an employment office.
- I just looking for my coin.

246
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:06,777
The employment office is right down there, pass the monkeys on the right.
You can't miss it.

247
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:09,113
Thanks.

248
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,578
Hey...

249
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:26,339
Okay, I mean you're over
 qualified for the job, but if you desperate, I can give you that.

250
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:30,968
- I'm desperate.
- Okay then.

251
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:58,621
- Just one.
- Hi.

252
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:08,256
Thank you.

253
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:50,089
- Hi there.
- Hi.

254
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:53,384
I think I saw you yesterday, I was cleaning the fountain?

255
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:58,723
- Yes, they let you out?
- No, I escaped.

256
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:04,187
- So, looks like you got the job.
- Yes.

257
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:09,275
- What do you do?
- I sell this little plastic gorillas with grape juice.

258
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:15,406
Yes, I've cleaned up a lot of those.

259
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:19,452
Hopefully it's just temporary,
until I figured out my life.

260
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,079
I get it.

261
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:27,376
- It's depressing, right?
- What do you mean?

262
00:35:27,418 --> 00:35:31,797
I mean, human being evolved over billions of years...

263
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:38,387
From scratch, stood up, made fire, build shelter, invented a wheel.

264
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:42,975
For what? So you can stand with the funny hat
and selling grape juice gorillas?

265
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:48,272
Kinda try not to think about that like that.

266
00:35:52,944 --> 00:35:55,279
I'm sorry.

267
00:35:57,657 --> 00:36:01,744
Do not worry, you not the only one whose
 try to figured out their lives.

268
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:14,257
- "How to have Win..."
- "Winning Conversation".

269
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:18,386
Winning Conversation? Okay...

270
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:22,932
- We having one right now.
- My sister gave it to me.

271
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,101
- And it good?
- I do not know.

272
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:30,147
- I guess, I'm having dinner with the author, so
I figured I should you know, read it.
- Right.

273
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:41,742
Alright, well, I got ot get back to the work.

274
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:46,455
- I'll see you again, Janice.
- See you later.

275
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,376
Watch up, the polar bear.

276
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:03,264
Hi, what's in the gorillas?
Some kind of sugar drink?

277
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:07,977
- It's grape juice
- Want a grape juice, honey?
- I want to grape juice.

278
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,397
- No, just one, how much are they?
- Six dollar.

279
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:15,943
Well, alright, just one.

280
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:19,155
Thank you.
Ok, hold on.

281
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:26,704
You said this was
grape juice, lady. It's not a grape juice.

282
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:30,875
- It isn't?
- No, it's grape drink, I want my money back.

283
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:36,923
- Can I have it, daddy?
- No, you can't, honey.
- But I want it! - Too much sugar, I'm sorry.

284
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:42,970
- Gosh, Indian giver.
- Where did you hear that?

285
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:48,768
- Thanks a lot, lady.
- I'm sorry.
- Bla-bla I'm sorry...

286
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:51,812
You need to get a live.

287
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:08,996
What are you doing in here, Janice? I'm really busy,
I'm trying to close a deal downtown.

288
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,501
- I could do that, George.
- No, damn it, no. Come on, don't do this, Janice.

289
00:38:13,584 --> 00:38:16,796
Do not make me feel guilty.
I told you this is not the job for you.

290
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:21,008
- Please, George, I need to pay my rent.
- We all need to pay rent, Janice.

291
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:25,137
- We just.... What is the matter with you?
- Nothing.

292
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:32,812
- Why you do that thing with your mouth?
- Nothing, George. I just need to pay my rent.

293
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:37,608
- What the hell, your teeth, Janice, They falling all out of your mouth!
- I do not know what's happening to me, George.

294
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:40,695
All your teeth fall out of your face!

295
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:50,413
Good morning, Janice.

296
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:25,323
You missed a spot.

297
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:29,327
- What?
- You missed a spot.

298
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:35,625
- I did? Where?
- No, I was just joking.

299
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:40,338
What? What did I miss?

300
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:43,966
No-no. I was just joking. I was just making a joke.

301
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:48,387
Oh, I've missed a spot.
That's funny.

302
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:52,517
- I don't know, maybe it's not.
- No, it's hysterical, it's really funny.

303
00:39:55,228 --> 00:39:58,272
- He just poked the monkey!
- What?

304
00:39:58,356 --> 00:40:02,026
That guy.
How would he like if someone did that to him?

305
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:07,240
- I'm gonna find out. Common. Hey! Hey!
- What?

306
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:11,035
- Do not poke the monkey, man.
- Chill out, I'm not hurting.

307
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:14,956
- I saw that you did, you pocked him.
- I did not poke the monkey. Nice hat.

308
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:19,418
- Yes, you did. How would you like if someone poked you?
- Do you wanna poked me?

309
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:23,881
- No, but I'm gonna pokes you, you asshole.
- Yeah, but you like that.

310
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:30,054
-There, how you like it? You like it?
- Go Janice!

311
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:33,391
Like that! Like that!

312
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:37,186
Don't poke the monkey!

313
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:40,731
Are you okay?

314
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:47,947
- Yes. He was poking the babies.
- I know, I know. I loved that.

315
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,117
Do not poke the fucking monkeys!

316
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:56,539
Did you see his face? He was freak out.
I loved that you grab it out of my hand.

317
00:40:56,622 --> 00:41:00,668
He was totally freak...
Do not poke monkey, don't poke the monkey!

318
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:05,381
- Do you think we gonna get fired?
- No.
- I can't afford to get fired.

319
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:10,469
- We will be alright.
- We need to rearrange that habitat or it just happen again.
- You should tell her that.
- I know.

320
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:19,854
Well, first of all, you guys are better that a security team.

321
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:23,316
- But second ..
- Sonia, look, if you gonna fire anyone, fire me, okay?

322
00:41:23,357 --> 00:41:28,571
- I started it. Jenice should not be fired.
- I'm not going to fire anybody.

323
00:41:28,654 --> 00:41:31,949
Look, between you and I,
I'm glad you guys stand up for the monkey.

324
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:35,453
But in the future, lets just call security, okay?

325
00:41:36,454 --> 00:41:38,706
- Okay
- Okay.

326
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:44,295
I think Janice has a suggestion.

327
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:48,090
Tell the thing that you just tell me.

328
00:41:49,258 --> 00:41:51,177
What is it?

329
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:57,099
Well... It's just that...
Right now the way that habitat is arranged...

330
00:41:57,183 --> 00:42:01,187
people can get right up to the rail, which is right there the monkey sleep.

331
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:07,568
If we move the rail back or put in a tree
or something to give the monkey more privacy.

332
00:42:07,652 --> 00:42:11,572
It would be just better, because when people
see a sleeping monkey, they start yell at it.

333
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:15,535
She's right. Some of this people are just wrack.
We need to protect the animals better.

334
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:20,164
- Especially the babies.
- I did not realize that they are so exposed.

335
00:42:20,248 --> 00:42:23,584
- It's wide open.
- We gonna get fix that, then.

336
00:42:23,668 --> 00:42:26,754
I'll call the habitat coordinator.
Thanks, Janice.

337
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:29,423
You're welcome.

338
00:42:31,092 --> 00:42:33,177
Nice,

339
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:38,891
Webster's Dictionary defines the word 'conversation' as
as the oral exchange of ideas

340
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,936
opinions and observations.

341
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:46,190
Hi, I'm Doug Duncan, Thank you so much for

342
00:42:46,274 --> 00:42:51,863
allowing me to be your tour guide today through
"conversation-nation"

343
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:56,158
Are you all ready to go on your tour or what?

344
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:05,668
Thank you. In order to have a meaningful conversation,
you gonna have that?

345
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:08,713
What do you need?

346
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:11,591
A desire to speak.

347
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:16,179
But in order to have a desire to speak,
 you need to have something to say

348
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:22,310
Where do we find these things?
Where are this things to say?

349
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:26,355
In your giant oversize purse, miss?
I do not think they are.

350
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:28,983
But look.

351
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:34,322
How about this handsome gentleman, here?
What is your name, sir?

352
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:37,700
- Toby.
- Ok, Toby, would you be willing to be my volunteer

353
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:41,162
in a little experiment, I'm gonna do today?

354
00:43:41,245 --> 00:43:45,082
- Sure.
- You say that now, Toby, but just wait...

355
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:50,254
Just kidding. Common up here, Toby.
Toby, have you ever been on a date?

356
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:57,428
- Once or twice.
- Ok, what you guys talk about?
- Just stuff. you know, stuff like that.

357
00:43:57,512 --> 00:44:04,310
"Just stuff. you know, stuff like that."
Wow... sounds fascinating.

358
00:44:04,352 --> 00:44:09,440
But seriously, Toby. That's why you are here today.
To learn the art of eloquence.

359
00:44:09,524 --> 00:44:14,320
Now, I want you all to pretend
that I'm a beautiful woman.

360
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:22,370
And me and Toby here are on a date.
What do you want to talk about Toby?

361
00:44:25,498 --> 00:44:28,501
- Common Toby!
- I do not know.

362
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:35,174
Okay, I want you to sit. Rule №1, people.
Stack the deck in your favor.

363
00:44:35,258 --> 00:44:40,429
If you do not know what to talk about,
talk about yourself.

364
00:44:40,513 --> 00:44:43,683
KEEP TALKING. D.D.

365
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:47,478
- How are you?
- Okay.
- Good to hear.

366
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:51,566
- Hi Doug.
- Hey.

367
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:56,529
- Sorry, this things just go so nuts.
- You are great up there.

368
00:44:56,612 --> 00:45:01,534
- You are really good, Doug.
- Jill, thank you, I really appreciate that compliment.

369
00:45:01,617 --> 00:45:04,245
- Hey Janice.
- Hi Doug.

370
00:45:04,328 --> 00:45:08,875
- Have you had a chance to read my book?
- Yeah, it's good.

371
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:12,837
I mean I've only read just a little bit of it,
 but it's good.

372
00:45:12,962 --> 00:45:18,301
- Well, the dinner is still stands.
- Okay.

373
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:23,723
- How about tomorrow night?
- Tomorrow night?

374
00:45:23,848 --> 00:45:29,103
- Yes, she would love to.
- Fantastic, wow! Okay.

375
00:45:30,521 --> 00:45:34,650
Guys can have some "Winning conversations"?

376
00:45:34,734 --> 00:45:38,571
- Well, duty calls.
- Thank you for the tickets.

377
00:45:38,654 --> 00:45:40,865
You're great.

378
00:45:40,948 --> 00:45:47,371
What we got here? Toby!
I was really impressed with your growth today.

379
00:45:47,455 --> 00:45:51,459
- Doug is perfect for you.
- Perfect.

380
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:56,672
I mean, your life was been on pause, for so many years.
I just feel like it's time for you to push the play button.

381
00:45:56,756 --> 00:45:59,967
- What is that saying?
- Which one?
- You know about two kinds of people

382
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:03,429
There are two different kinds of people in the world.
There those who...

383
00:46:03,513 --> 00:46:06,849
- Something. Something...
- They carry...
- Never mind.

384
00:46:06,933 --> 00:46:10,061
It's basically, there two kind of people in this world. And you don't want to end with the wrong kind.

385
00:46:10,144 --> 00:46:13,439
- We just try to help you, Janice.
- We're on your team, Janice.
- Your team, Janice.

386
00:46:13,523 --> 00:46:16,567
Team that pays the bills.

387
00:46:55,565 --> 00:46:58,609
Hey, Janice! Hey!

388
00:46:59,986 --> 00:47:03,990
- You left your book in a break room.
- Oh, thanks.

389
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:09,996
I didn't get a chance to read it, but I did see the author
 picture and he...

390
00:47:10,663 --> 00:47:14,500
- Kinda look like a cheese ball, right?
- Yes.

391
00:47:16,836 --> 00:47:24,260
Look, I'm sorry for getting all "Charles Darwin" in the arctic castle.
That nonsense about the swamp and...

392
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:26,137
It wasn't nonsense.

393
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,600
- It's kinda was.
- I don't know it made sense

394
00:47:30,683 --> 00:47:35,354
- Did it?
- I mean to me it did, cause I've no idea that I'm doing.

395
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:39,734
I mean, I have no clue.

396
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:43,529
- No clue what I'm doing.
- Neither do I.

397
00:47:43,613 --> 00:47:48,326
But I'm talking about my life, I
do not want to sell grape juice gorillas.

398
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:52,455
- Or go out with this cheese head, but I do not know ..
- So, then why are you?

399
00:47:52,538 --> 00:47:56,876
- Why am I what?
- Why are selling grape juice gorillas?

400
00:47:56,959 --> 00:48:00,546
Because, what else would I gonna do?
I need a job.

401
00:48:04,383 --> 00:48:06,552
I get it.

402
00:48:06,636 --> 00:48:09,931
And I'm...

403
00:48:10,014 --> 00:48:13,643
I'm actually living with my sister right now.
And she kinda won't living me alone.

404
00:48:13,726 --> 00:48:18,147
- "What's your job, Janice?,
What are you interests?"
- Exactly.

405
00:48:18,231 --> 00:48:22,527
"What are you doing with your life?
What is a point of you?"
Why should anybody care about.

406
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:26,531
- Yeah, you sound just like my sister.
- Just like my girlfriend, actually.

407
00:48:28,032 --> 00:48:31,619
- Right.
- Yes.

408
00:48:33,704 --> 00:48:36,541
- That's funny.
- Yes.

409
00:48:39,252 --> 00:48:42,338
- So, anyway...
- People... weird.

410
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:45,049
Yeah, they are.

411
00:48:45,132 --> 00:48:51,222
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay, cool.
- Okay.

412
00:48:55,351 --> 00:48:58,145
I meant, ex-girlfriend, by the way.

413
00:48:59,313 --> 00:49:05,403
- What?
- When I said that, I meant to say ex-girlfriend.

414
00:49:05,486 --> 00:49:08,865
- I didn't even...
- No-no, that's cool...

415
00:49:09,365 --> 00:49:12,451
- I was just...
- Yeah, yeah...

416
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:25,381
There she is.

417
00:49:38,644 --> 00:49:42,356
Thanks.

418
00:49:45,026 --> 00:49:48,738
I've written books about, you know,
 a lot of different subjects.

419
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:53,326
You name a topic, I've written about it.
This is go ahead, pick a topic.

420
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:56,913
- What do you mean?
- Just pick a topic. Any topic.

421
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:06,881
Diet, conversation, health, dreams,
travel... pick a topic .. Health, dreams, travel...

422
00:50:06,964 --> 00:50:11,052
- Dreams.
- Okay, dreams. What do you want to know about dreams?

423
00:50:11,135 --> 00:50:13,679
I do not know, I was just picking a topic.

424
00:50:13,763 --> 00:50:18,100
Dreams are the subconscious mind,
telling the conscious mind that it needs.

425
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:21,521
Tell me about the latest dream that you had.

426
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:26,234
Do not worry, I'm not going to judge you.
Just tell me about the latest dream that you had.

427
00:50:26,817 --> 00:50:33,908
Ok, well. I was at this a job interview and my teeth started falling out.

428
00:50:33,991 --> 00:50:38,829
- What?
- In a dream my teeth were falling out.
- Holy shit, that's crazy.

429
00:50:38,913 --> 00:50:44,335
I mean, you must be crazy person.. just kidding.
But seriously, that pretty messed up.

430
00:50:44,377 --> 00:50:49,465
You know that, just buy my book on dreams.
It'll tell you everything you need to know.

431
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:51,968
And what is for dinner.

432
00:50:53,678 --> 00:50:55,930
They have a cheesecake.

433
00:50:56,931 --> 00:51:00,935
There is also this box under the bed with some letters.

434
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,191
- This is the box.
- Thank you.

435
00:51:07,275 --> 00:51:10,528
- You've missed a shoe.
- Okay, thank you.

436
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:14,240
And some of the books.

437
00:51:17,952 --> 00:51:23,457
- I also want to apologize to you.
- For that? You don't have to apologize.

438
00:51:23,541 --> 00:51:29,005
For that I said about that I've never believed in you.

439
00:51:29,088 --> 00:51:35,595
- Oh, that.
- It was harsh, and I'm sorry.

440
00:51:35,678 --> 00:51:40,349
It's okay, I'm gonna quit that stuff anyway.

441
00:51:40,433 --> 00:51:47,190
- Nobody really seems to get it.
- Tim, you quit, what?

442
00:51:48,232 --> 00:51:50,943
No.

443
00:51:52,278 --> 00:51:57,867
It's a worthless skill. It's not like I'm a piano player
 or a painter or something.

444
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:03,748
- It's got no value. I get it.
- I was angry when I said all that, Tim

445
00:52:03,873 --> 00:52:06,042
I don't think it's true.

446
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:12,089
I know you gonna take this thing and evolve it into...

447
00:52:12,173 --> 00:52:16,886
I do not know... something bigger, whatever your brain takes it,
cause you don't see the finish line.

448
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:20,389
You don't ever put that pressure on yourself.

449
00:52:20,473 --> 00:52:25,228
And that's so great about you.

450
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,734
- I am really sorry.
- Why?

451
00:52:31,859 --> 00:52:36,280
Because I let you down.
Because I wasn't enough.

452
00:52:36,322 --> 00:52:41,035
Tim, you did not let me down. Okay?

453
00:52:41,118 --> 00:52:45,623
We just grew in different directions.

454
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:53,089
But I still really like to be your friend.

455
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:58,344
You gotta get in the conversation.
You can't just knock on the door, "May I come in?"

456
00:52:58,427 --> 00:53:04,308
You gotta bust right in there!
In fact. I can't believe I'm gonna tell you this.

457
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:11,899
I used to be horrible in conversations. What?
Me? I know! It's crazy.

458
00:53:11,983 --> 00:53:16,696
But I'm just, you know, could talk about
the weather and stupid stuff like that.

459
00:53:16,821 --> 00:53:20,825
But when I came to true emotion, expression of feelings...

460
00:53:20,908 --> 00:53:26,289
The words are just get blocked.
Right in the neck area.

461
00:53:28,082 --> 00:53:34,297
Not anymore, now when I want something, bang, instant words.

462
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:39,093
For instance, gosh .. I do not know...

463
00:53:39,177 --> 00:53:45,266
If I want to kiss you, I'd just say
"Hey, I want to kiss you."

464
00:53:45,308 --> 00:53:51,397
Simple, just like that.
I do not mean right now, we are in the restaurant.

465
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,276
That'd be weird plus I don't wanna seem to be to forward or anything.

466
00:53:55,318 --> 00:54:01,115
But I could easily say it any moment,
so, be on a look out for that.

467
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:07,455
Let's see what is for dessert tonight.

468
00:54:17,048 --> 00:54:19,342
I need whiskey?!

469
00:54:19,425 --> 00:54:23,137
I did a podcast, I have twitter

470
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:27,058
I forgot my jacket, I'll be right back.

471
00:54:27,683 --> 00:54:31,145
- Tim
- Janice, hey.

472
00:54:31,229 --> 00:54:35,608
- What are you doing here?
- I just get a drink.

473
00:54:35,691 --> 00:54:39,320
Do you want to join me?

474
00:54:39,362 --> 00:54:44,575
Oh, my jacket was on a god damn bus stop.
It's like a steak sauce or something.

475
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:50,706
- Doug, this is my friend Tim
- What's up, bro? Cool hat.

476
00:54:52,166 --> 00:54:54,335
Thanks, bro.

477
00:54:57,129 --> 00:55:00,466
Alright, I'll see you tomorrow at work, right?

478
00:55:01,676 --> 00:55:04,428
- Okay.
- Cool.

479
00:55:41,174 --> 00:55:45,219
- Hey Tim.
- Hey Janice. How is it going?

480
00:55:45,303 --> 00:55:50,850
- Good, how are you?
- I'm okay, just taking a break, watching a penguins.

481
00:55:50,933 --> 00:55:53,936
I love this guys.

482
00:55:58,065 --> 00:56:02,820
- So...
- That was weird .. last night.

483
00:56:05,156 --> 00:56:09,160
- That was the guy, the author guy?
- Yes, that was him.

484
00:56:09,243 --> 00:56:12,830
- We were just hanging out.
- Yeah, yeah.

485
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:18,002
We should hang out?

486
00:56:18,419 --> 00:56:22,507
- Who?
- You and me.

487
00:56:23,424 --> 00:56:28,930
- Okay.
- Like, soon, like, tomorrow night?
You got plans tomorrow night?

488
00:56:29,013 --> 00:56:33,518
-No
- You should go to a party with me. Do you wanna go to a party with me?
- Okay, Yeah. Sure

489
00:56:35,269 --> 00:56:37,355
Good.

490
00:56:44,028 --> 00:56:46,113
Oh, look at that guy.

491
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,328
- Hey, sister.
- Hey.

492
00:56:52,411 --> 00:56:55,039
- You should try level 7.
- No, no. This' is fine.

493
00:56:55,122 --> 00:56:57,667
Fine, see you self.

494
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,631
- What?
- I've got good news for you.

495
00:57:03,714 --> 00:57:08,010
- What?
- I think you gonna like it.
- What, Jill? What? What is the news?

496
00:57:08,094 --> 00:57:13,140
Doug Duncan asked Brian about you today.
I guess he liked his date.

497
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:18,604
- Oh. yeah.
- Yep, and he is taking the four of us out to dinner Thursday night.
And you're not saying NO. I'm not let you say NO.

498
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:26,904
- What are you doing?, Jill.
- You gonna burn. Jenice,
Doug likes slim girl.

499
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:40,168
There she is.

500
00:57:45,214 --> 00:57:51,012
Happy birthday. You look beautiful.
This is Janice.

501
00:57:51,095 --> 00:57:54,223
- Janice.
- Hi.
- Hey, I heard a lot about you.

502
00:57:54,307 --> 00:57:56,809
- Really? Wow.
- That's awesome.

503
00:57:56,893 --> 00:58:01,647
- What's up man?
- Hello, Tim

504
00:58:01,772 --> 00:58:04,567
- This is my friend.
- Hey, what's up? I'm Wesley.

505
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:08,905
- I'm Janice.
- I want you to have this.

506
00:58:08,988 --> 00:58:12,533
You want me to have this? Alright.

507
00:58:12,617 --> 00:58:15,536
I'll take your photos.

508
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:19,832
- This guy is a great photographer.
- A wonderful picture.

509
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:07,213
Thanks everyone.
I am so glad you all came.

510
00:59:07,296 --> 00:59:12,260
You are the best friends,
 a person could hope for.

511
00:59:12,301 --> 00:59:18,641
You are like family to me.
It's true, I don't care it's sounds cheesy, It's true.

512
00:59:18,766 --> 00:59:25,106
I also want to thank my wonderful man, Wesley.

513
00:59:34,282 --> 00:59:40,162
He is always so supportive of me and makes me feel loved.

514
00:59:40,246 --> 00:59:44,250
And it's true what they say...

515
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:49,130
It only takes one person, just one person...

516
00:59:49,213 --> 00:59:56,012
... to make you feel special, valued and like you belong
in the world.

517
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,437
Let's have some cake!

518
01:00:09,442 --> 01:00:13,779
- I thought he was talking to you.
- No, no, apparently he was talking to you.

519
01:00:13,863 --> 01:00:17,575
- I did not answer him.
- No, but he was standing there, he's very close talker.

520
01:00:17,658 --> 01:00:20,536
Very close.

521
01:00:20,786 --> 01:00:26,250
- Where were you born? Were you born here?
- No, I was born in Wyoming, actually.

522
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:30,087
Wyoming? I heard good thing about Wyoming.
 It's beautiful there.

523
01:00:30,171 --> 01:00:35,384
Yes, I heard that to, but I do not really remember,
because I sort of moved away when I was little.

524
01:00:35,468 --> 01:00:41,516
- Sorta moved away?
- I am adopted, so I was adopted, basically.

525
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,270
- Ok, what was that like?
- Being adopted?

526
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,777
- Yes.
- It was weird because my little sister, Jill, was
not adopted ..

527
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:55,905
So it was kinda...I mean.. But it's fine now.

528
01:00:55,988 --> 01:01:01,285
But when I was 7, I really want to grow up and moved away.

529
01:01:01,327 --> 01:01:06,916
I thought growing it meant that you loose your baby teeth
 and you get your big ones.

530
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:10,670
And I read in this book that
if you tie peace of string around your tooth

531
01:01:10,795 --> 01:01:16,092
and then tie the other end to a door knob you can slam the door and you baby tooth will come out.

532
01:01:16,175 --> 01:01:19,512
- So I tried it.
- What happened? Did your teeth fall out?

533
01:01:19,595 --> 01:01:24,517
No, the door slam back in to my head and I had to get 3 stitches.

534
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:29,355
- Oh, shit.
- It's was a bad idea.

535
01:01:30,022 --> 01:01:35,820
- Let me see it.
- Right there.
- Okay, I see.
- Right above my eyebrow? Can you see it?

536
01:01:35,903 --> 01:01:39,699
Yes, I get it. I like that.

537
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:46,789
Makes you look tough,
 look like you kicked ass with this stitches.

538
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:52,378
Yes. My dad would tell me to say
"You should see the door."

539
01:01:52,461 --> 01:01:55,590
You know, cause...
I don't know, it's a dad joke...

540
01:01:57,633 --> 01:02:01,971
Sometimes I have dreams where my teeth are falling out.

541
01:02:02,054 --> 01:02:06,434
Are you serious?
I just had that dream. It freaked me out.

542
01:02:06,517 --> 01:02:10,396
Do not worry.
It's common...People have it all the time, or at least the say that they say

543
01:02:10,479 --> 01:02:16,485
- Do you know what it means?
- You know, Teeth are for chewing, for biting.

544
01:02:16,569 --> 01:02:19,655
You know, they are powerful.

545
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:23,784
And they are falling out, so you feel powerless.

546
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:27,747
- Okay
- Yes, I have it all the time.

547
01:02:29,582 --> 01:02:34,212
But you know what helps?
Apple Pie.

548
01:02:34,253 --> 01:02:39,800
- Really?
- Makes you feel really powerful.

549
01:02:39,884 --> 01:02:45,014
- We should split one than.
- You want to split a whole pie?
- Okay.

550
01:02:45,097 --> 01:02:50,311
- Do you want it?
- Do you..
- Yeah, absolu-- Excuse me, can we get that whole pie?

551
01:02:50,394 --> 01:02:56,067
Can we take the whole thing?
Thank you, it looks tremendous.

552
01:02:56,150 --> 01:03:00,571
- Thanks a lot.
- She just gave you a whole pie.

553
01:03:00,655 --> 01:03:03,241
Yeah, let's do it.

554
01:03:09,247 --> 01:03:11,624
Come on in.

555
01:03:13,042 --> 01:03:16,254
- Want a beer?
- Sure.

556
01:03:19,882 --> 01:03:24,053
- I like your place.
- Thanks, it's wreck control.

557
01:03:24,136 --> 01:03:27,390
So they keep training to kick me out.

558
01:03:27,473 --> 01:03:31,018
- It's kinda drafty in here.
You cold?
- No.

559
01:03:31,102 --> 01:03:33,646
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

560
01:03:37,275 --> 01:03:39,944
- Where did you get it?
- I found it.

561
01:03:40,027 --> 01:03:45,074
- It's so small.
- I think it looks like me.

562
01:03:45,157 --> 01:03:48,160
- Really?
- Yes

563
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:53,332
- No. .. you're prettier.
- How about now?

564
01:03:54,959 --> 01:03:58,629
- You're still prettier.
- You think so?
- I do.

565
01:04:01,674 --> 01:04:05,344
I think you're just great.

566
01:04:08,055 --> 01:04:11,434
You know that's so great about you - you real.

567
01:04:11,517 --> 01:04:15,479
You don't pretend that you got it all figured it out.

568
01:04:15,563 --> 01:04:25,781
Like everyone else walking around life.
You're real. You're genuine. And you notice things too.

569
01:04:25,865 --> 01:04:31,078
You pay attention .., like the monkeys.

570
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:36,083
When I look at you ..

571
01:04:39,128 --> 01:04:41,589
I can see you.

572
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,261
I see you.

573
01:04:49,972 --> 01:04:53,392
I just think you're great.

574
01:04:56,103 --> 01:04:59,232
- Thank you.
- I'm meant it.

575
01:04:59,857 --> 01:05:05,404
Seriously, I want to quit the zoo
long time ago if you do not work there, really.

576
01:05:05,488 --> 01:05:08,366
- Thank you.
- Do not thank me, just...

577
01:05:13,287 --> 01:05:17,959
- Are you dating the winning conversation guy or what?
- No.

578
01:05:18,042 --> 01:05:21,254
- You're not?
- Dating him? No.

579
01:05:22,463 --> 01:05:26,551
Alright, I was just checking,
because you never know.

580
01:05:36,811 --> 01:05:39,856
I want to ask you...

581
01:05:40,857 --> 01:05:48,865
So have you running to that Giant Mechanical guy walking around?

582
01:05:48,948 --> 01:05:51,659
I want to kiss you.

583
01:05:51,993 --> 01:05:56,289
- What?
- I want to kiss you.

584
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:01,878
Okay.

585
01:06:36,871 --> 01:06:42,001
That zoo job is the best thing that ever happened to me.

586
01:06:43,461 --> 01:06:47,590
- I always look forward to seeing you.
- Me too.

587
01:06:50,218 --> 01:06:55,515
You know what... we should definitely should hang out more.

588
01:06:58,935 --> 01:07:02,104
- Yes.
- Yes. I'd like that.

589
01:07:04,857 --> 01:07:11,155
- Do you like silent films?
- Silent films? I loved them.
- Really?
-Yes.

590
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:17,370
- Well, they do the silent film program
- At the art-house cinema. Yes, I've been there.

591
01:07:17,453 --> 01:07:21,499
Do you want to maybe go with me, Friday night?

592
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:25,002
- You and me?
- Yes.

593
01:07:25,211 --> 01:07:28,589
And I thought, I could ask my sister and her husband if they want to join us.

594
01:07:28,673 --> 01:07:32,009
I already get to meet your sister?

595
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:35,471
This is getting serious.

596
01:07:35,555 --> 01:07:39,350
- I was just..
- No, it's good, that sounds great.

597
01:07:39,433 --> 01:07:46,899
- Okay, we don't have to get serious...
- No, serious it was good. I like serious.

598
01:07:47,984 --> 01:07:50,862
- You do?
- With you, I do.

599
01:08:35,489 --> 01:08:39,869
- Sonia.
- Yes, Janice.

600
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:46,542
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. What is up?

601
01:08:47,543 --> 01:08:51,297
- I do not like my job.
- You do not?

602
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:58,554
- No, I'm better than selling drinks.
- Okay, what kind of job do you want?

603
01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:04,936
Just something where I can think,
and make decisions.

604
01:09:05,019 --> 01:09:09,357
- You said I'm over qualified when you hired me.
- I did say that, didn't I?

605
01:09:11,984 --> 01:09:16,572
- Did something happened to you?
- Yes.

606
01:09:16,656 --> 01:09:20,743
- A lot happened to me.
- I can tell.

607
01:09:22,036 --> 01:09:27,250
- What about assistant habitat coordinator?
- I can do that.

608
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:30,169
Good, go do it.

609
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:34,173
Thank you.

610
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:46,894
- Hang on, Janice?
- Hey, Jill. Guess what?
- Hey, we're leaving at 6.
- We're going to what?
- We have a dinner with Doug.

611
01:09:46,894 --> 01:09:50,940
You didn't forget, did you?
Anyway, 6 o'clock.

612
01:09:51,023 --> 01:09:54,610
Sorry, It was just my sister.

613
01:09:54,819 --> 01:10:01,242
The most important part. Do not be
vegetation, try a conversation.

614
01:10:01,284 --> 01:10:05,329
Absolutely, I get what you're saying, but I just say
it is different for guys.

615
01:10:05,413 --> 01:10:10,209
- No it's not.
- Honey, sure it is, I mean women are more cautious.

616
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:14,839
- I think, it depends on the woman.
- Maybe.

617
01:10:14,922 --> 01:10:20,094
- Janice, what do you think?
- I will not ask, cause she hadn't have that much experience with guys.

618
01:10:20,178 --> 01:10:24,849
- Yes, right Janice?
- What?
- Are you listening?
- Not really.

619
01:10:24,932 --> 01:10:28,811
I've just saying you haven't had many boyfriends.

620
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:33,482
Excuse me, I going to the restroom.

621
01:10:36,819 --> 01:10:38,905
Okay.

622
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:43,993
There is a great little wine bar near just
 down the street, for the night cup?

623
01:10:44,076 --> 01:10:48,915
- Yeah, that sounds fantastic.
- Yeah, but I'm Janice will say no.

624
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:56,088
- You know what? Maybe I'll be able to convince her.
You guys go ahead.

625
01:10:56,172 --> 01:11:01,802
- We are here alone, we'll walk down together.
- Great, it's just around the corner.

626
01:11:01,886 --> 01:11:04,180
Great.

627
01:11:11,938 --> 01:11:15,566
- Where did they go?
- You know what?

628
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:21,239
They had an idea to go down the street for a little night cup, but if you not up for it, we can...

629
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:25,576
- No, that sounds great.
- Okay, very cool.

630
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:34,794
- It's chilly out here.
- Yes, it's fine.

631
01:11:34,877 --> 01:11:37,839
You know I can ..

632
01:11:42,844 --> 01:11:46,305
Wow, this weird robot dude.

633
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:49,517
"Take me to your leader."

634
01:11:55,022 --> 01:11:57,358
That was nice.

635
01:12:03,197 --> 01:12:06,450
Doug, please, stop.

636
01:12:06,534 --> 01:12:11,163
- You do not feel the vibration?
- No.

637
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:16,502
Loose it up.

638
01:14:07,446 --> 01:14:12,243
- Hey, Sonia, have you see Tim?
- Tim? No, he did not come in today.

639
01:14:12,326 --> 01:14:15,204
Oh, that's weird.

640
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:25,923
- Assistant habitat coordinator.
- Its amazing.

641
01:14:26,007 --> 01:14:29,969
- Congratulations, Janice.
- Thank you.
- What kind of outfit you'll be wearing?

642
01:14:30,052 --> 01:14:33,723
- Pants, probably pants
- Probably.
- Where is your friend?

643
01:14:33,848 --> 01:14:37,894
- He will here.
- Yeah, but the movie is about to start.

644
01:14:37,977 --> 01:14:41,397
- Are you guys come to movie?
- Yes.
- We gonna be start.

645
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:45,860
- They gonna be starting. Like now.
- Okay, okay.

646
01:14:45,943 --> 01:14:48,237
Come on!

647
01:14:49,405 --> 01:14:52,200
Come on, Tim

648
01:15:13,304 --> 01:15:16,849
Maybe I should call Doug?

649
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:33,741
Doug, hi, it's Jill.

650
01:15:51,843 --> 01:15:56,472
Doug, thanks so much for coming, she's really bored.

651
01:15:56,556 --> 01:16:00,685
- Come on, it's all good.
- She's gonna be so happy to see you.

652
01:16:01,769 --> 01:16:04,939
Janice, look who's here, Doug.

653
01:16:05,022 --> 01:16:08,609
What ..? What is he doing here?

654
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:13,698
Janice, do not be rude.
He came to see you.

655
01:16:13,781 --> 01:16:17,994
- Ouch, Janice.
- She's just upset, cause the zoo guy didn't show up...

656
01:16:18,077 --> 01:16:21,455
But she'll be fine, right, Janice?
You'll be fine.

657
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:30,214
- What're you doing? Come on, Janice. You're being weird.
- You just need a sense of accomplishment, Janice.

658
01:16:30,298 --> 01:16:33,259
Yes, or yoga.

659
01:16:33,342 --> 01:16:38,931
- She just needs a new attitude, because she always so negative.
- There's a chapter in my book about positive thinking...

660
01:16:39,015 --> 01:16:42,351
Every time I read it,
it puts me in a real good place.

661
01:16:42,435 --> 01:16:46,063
See? That's what she needs.
You need to read his book.

662
01:16:46,147 --> 01:16:50,193
No, Jill.
I do not need this god damn book.

663
01:16:50,276 --> 01:16:54,322
- I do not need a god damn thing.
- Okay.

664
01:16:54,405 --> 01:16:56,949
Stop it, okay? Stop.

665
01:16:57,033 --> 01:17:02,538
Stop with the books and the stupid dates
and stupid advise because I do not want it.

666
01:17:02,622 --> 01:17:06,501
- I do not want any of it.
- Fine, what do you want then?

667
01:17:06,584 --> 01:17:12,256
- No, I just trying to help.
- No, you not helping Jill.
You're not helping me.

668
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:15,801
Can you see that?
You hurting me.
Can you see that you're hurting me?

669
01:17:15,885 --> 01:17:23,851
- God, I just feel that you should really read the book.
- Doug, stop trying so hard.

670
01:17:23,935 --> 01:17:27,104
- Janice...
- He's go and on.

671
01:17:27,188 --> 01:17:32,860
Okay, alright everyone .. Let's just calm down, please.
Doug let's give ladies a minute.

672
01:17:36,489 --> 01:17:40,910
- Why do you always have to be so weird?
- Stop talking to me like that, Jill.

673
01:17:40,993 --> 01:17:45,831
I'm supposed to be the big sister.
I'm supposed to be your big sister.

674
01:17:45,873 --> 01:17:50,795
-Yeah.
- Yeah but, you're always talking down to me.

675
01:17:50,878 --> 01:17:55,049
- No, I'm not.
- Yes you are, Jill. Always. Always talking down to me.
 Telling me that I need,

676
01:17:55,132 --> 01:17:58,219
Telling me that I'm doing wrong, all the time

677
01:17:58,302 --> 01:18:04,141
I mean, I do not want what you want, Jill.

678
01:18:04,183 --> 01:18:09,814
- I do not want that you want.
- Okay fine, what do you want, Janice?

679
01:18:09,897 --> 01:18:16,028
- What?
- I do not know. I do not know.

680
01:18:16,112 --> 01:18:22,285
Do I have to know? Is the fee of the universe like...
Why do I have to know?

681
01:18:23,786 --> 01:18:28,916
Why do I have to be something?
Can I just be myself? Is not that just enough?

682
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,045
- Sorry, can you keep it down a little bit?
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

683
01:18:34,046 --> 01:18:36,382
Janice.

684
01:18:40,178 --> 01:18:42,889
I'm just worried about you.

685
01:18:42,972 --> 01:18:48,811
I feel like you are struggling and
I just want to help.

686
01:18:48,895 --> 01:18:54,734
If you really want to help, just being my little sister. Okay?
Can you do that? Can you just be my little sister?

687
01:18:54,817 --> 01:18:57,278
- Yes
- Thank you.

688
01:18:57,361 --> 01:19:03,075
- Because the truth is, right now I could really use a sister.
- Okay.

689
01:19:03,159 --> 01:19:05,703
I think...

690
01:19:07,288 --> 01:19:12,293
What? Come on, Janice. You can tell me.

691
01:19:13,586 --> 01:19:16,506
I think I'm in love with him.

692
01:19:16,589 --> 01:19:19,217
- Who?
- Tim.

693
01:19:23,513 --> 01:19:30,728
And I'm confused, because I do not understand...
I mean, he supposed to be here.

694
01:19:32,188 --> 01:19:35,024
Yeah, I know.

695
01:19:35,107 --> 01:19:37,818
I'm sorry, Janice.

696
01:19:42,323 --> 01:19:46,160
- Let us go home.
- I do not want to go home.

697
01:19:46,452 --> 01:19:49,497
- No?
- No, I'm really embarrassed.

698
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:54,502
- I do not really want to see those guys.
- Okay.

699
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:58,714
I kinda just be by myself for a little while.

700
01:19:58,798 --> 01:20:01,717
- You sure?
- Yes.

701
01:20:02,385 --> 01:20:05,930
Alright, I'll get the boys.

702
01:21:20,463 --> 01:21:23,090
Hey, Remember me?

703
01:21:24,967 --> 01:21:27,970
So you just stand out here all night.

704
01:21:33,226 --> 01:21:37,021
I do not have any extra change, I'd give it to you, but...

705
01:21:41,067 --> 01:21:43,361
Can I ask you something?

706
01:21:43,444 --> 01:21:49,075
When I saw you on TV, you said
something about people feeling lost?

707
01:21:49,158 --> 01:21:53,955
Is that how you feel?
Because sometimes...

708
01:21:54,038 --> 01:21:57,041
Sometimes I just feel invisible.

709
01:21:58,876 --> 01:22:03,714
And I heard someone say something recently, that it's
only take one person ..

710
01:22:03,798 --> 01:22:09,929
Just one person to make you feel like you belong, to make you feel special.

711
01:22:11,889 --> 01:22:14,475
And I think that that's true.

712
01:22:14,559 --> 01:22:19,856
I know that that's true because I felt it.

713
01:22:19,939 --> 01:22:23,234
The other night I was out with this guy that I worked with...

714
01:22:23,317 --> 01:22:25,570
... work at the zoo.

715
01:22:25,695 --> 01:22:30,449
And anyway, it was only for one night...

716
01:22:30,533 --> 01:22:34,453
But it just felt different, you know?

717
01:22:36,581 --> 01:22:39,750
And now it's complicated.

718
01:22:50,052 --> 01:22:52,180
Tim?

719
01:23:12,241 --> 01:23:15,203
The Giant Mechanical Man.

720
01:23:21,459 --> 01:23:25,296
- Hey, guys. This is Tim.
- Nice to meet you.

721
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:41,062
I think we can move it a little to the left
to give them more room to eat.

722
01:23:41,145 --> 01:23:44,649
- And maybe bring up some enrichment here.
-I can see that. Right over there.

723
01:23:44,732 --> 01:23:48,319
Alright, Janice. Thank you.

724
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:20,518
Now this whole thing. Everything we gonna do here, we gonna open up the whole space.

725
01:24:20,643 --> 01:24:25,815
And we gonna have this extra little habitat area, right over there.

726
01:24:36,742 --> 01:24:41,998
Jill, you guys should come down town to meet us.
We gonna see a play later.

727
01:24:43,666 --> 01:24:51,841
Actually, I'm looking for a Tim right now.
There he is. Let me know.

728
01:28:05,868 --> 01:28:08,412
Flag on a play!

729
01:28:08,746 --> 01:28:15,294
Now, if you think about it.
A conversation is a little bit like a football game, isn't it?

730
01:28:15,378 --> 01:28:21,300
You got one, two, three, four-quarters.

731
01:28:21,384 --> 01:28:25,388
If you are really lucky, what do you get?

732
01:28:25,471 --> 01:28:27,682
What do you get if we're really lucky?

733
01:28:28,808 --> 01:28:33,187
You get over time. Right?

734
01:28:33,271 --> 01:28:40,278
In order get to over time, you can not blow off
all your fun stuff, all your trick plays in the first quarter, can't you?

735
01:28:40,361 --> 01:28:45,700
You gotta wait for half-time, or, as I like to call it, end of dinner

736
01:28:45,783 --> 01:28:51,956
Just a stuff get a little stale, a little boring. Bang!
You pull out your best joke.

737
01:28:52,039 --> 01:28:58,629
Or even better, a little story.
Doesn't matter if it's not true. Make it up. Lie. Doesn't matter.

738
01:28:58,713 --> 01:29:05,303
The entire point is you gotta get to over time,
because that's is where all the fun happens.

739
01:29:05,386 --> 01:29:08,848
This guy know what I'm talking about, right?
"Touchdown!"
