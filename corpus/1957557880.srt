1
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,579
<i>It was a dark</i>
<i>and stormy night</i>

2
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,164
<i>out on the open sea.</i>

3
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>The legendary ship,</i>
<i>The Shiny Cutlass,</i>

4
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,502
<i>was still in trouble.</i>

5
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,172
<i>Admiral Boggs was worried.</i>

6
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,882
<i>With a tangled topsail the ship</i>

7
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,259
<i>was bound to run aground.</i>

8
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,178
<i>The crew's only hope was...</i>

9
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,058
<i>Captain Trumpet-Tooter!</i>

10
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,111
Nicely done, Trumpet-Tooter!

11
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,451
Ahoy! Pirates!

12
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,122
<i>Using his trusty spyglass,</i>

13
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,792
<i>Trumpet Tooter spotted</i>
<i>the pirate ship.</i>

14
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,587
<i>If he didn't act fast,</i>
<i>it would surely catch them.</i>

15
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,807
Whoa!

16
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,726
Our map!

17
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,687
What shall we do now?

18
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,690
<i>Trumpet-Tooter</i>
<i>didn't need a map.</i>

19
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:31,776
<i>A sailor goes</i>
<i>where the wind takes him.</i>

20
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,154
But what if the wind takes us

21
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,488
straight into that?

22
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,788
Everything's getting wet.

23
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,998
George!

24
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,459
Too much splashing.

25
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,800
Look, I-- I know how excited
you get by these

26
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,512
Trumpet-Tooter books,
but now it's bedtime.

27
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,270
The whale can wait.

28
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,273
We need a good night's sleep,

29
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,443
because tomorrow
is our vacation to Coddington.

30
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,003
Got a second, George?

31
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,300
These are my souvenirs
from when I went

32
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,511
to Coddington as a kid.

33
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,723
Oh.

34
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,105
It was my favorite
vacation ever.

35
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,607
And I now want it
to be yours's too.

36
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,664
Ah! My napkin
from the Codfather restaurant.

37
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:11,751
Oh, best spaghetti
and codballs you'll ever have.

38
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,466
Whoa!

39
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,135
Cod light

40
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,886
from the Coddington Museum.

41
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:23,972
Pretty neat, huh?

42
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,060
And best of all...

43
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,895
Cod Fest.

44
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,732
The day when the whole town
becomes a carnival.

45
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,570
There are rides,
games, balloons.

46
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,200
Oh, and not only did
I put our whole schedule

47
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,369
on this handy-dandy card...

48
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,165
I programmed it into my watch.

49
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,293
I'm setting
the first alarm for dawn.

50
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,464
We'll get there early
and spend the day at the beach.

51
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,939
Okay, one more chapter,

52
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,317
just to help you sleep.

53
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,071
"The whale was headed straight

54
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,031
for Trumpet-Tooter.

55
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,199
But he knew...

56
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,784
just...

57
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,079
what to do..."

58
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,225
Aah! George!

59
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,643
We slept through our alarm.

60
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,937
We are behind schedule.

61
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,487
Uh. Flip-flops!

62
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,825
Uh, beach toys.

63
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,453
Floaties!

64
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,422
George, the floatie doesn't need
to be inflated yet.

65
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,881
It's not going to fit.

66
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,177
George!

67
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,140
Aah.

68
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:37,355
* Racing along
don't ever care *

69
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,900
* Sun in your face
wind in your hair *

70
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:46,906
* Humming a song
and feeling so fine *

71
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,743
* What could go wrong *

72
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:53,872
* In the sweet
sweet summertime *

73
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,756
* Everything's cool
everything's fine *

74
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,426
* Don't need a nickel
to have a good time *

75
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,678
* The days are bright *

76
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,350
* As a shining new dime *

77
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,226
* It's all going right *

78
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:21,107
* In the sweet
sweet summertime *

79
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,819
* Curious delirious *

80
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,698
* There's just no way
you can be serious *

81
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,410
* It's such a great sensation *

82
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,122
* We're going on vacation *

83
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,466
* No need for worries *

84
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,967
* No frowns or frets *

85
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,930
* Wherever you are
is as good as it gets *

86
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,391
* Like a balloon *

87
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:59,187
* That's starting to climb *

88
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,563
* Happy today *

89
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,067
* In the sweet
sweet summertime *

90
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,453
* No clouds in sight *

91
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,080
* No sigh of rain *

92
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:21,126
* When things are so right,
no need to complain *

93
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,794
* Me and my pal *

94
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,589
* Rocking the rhythm in life *

95
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:33,221
* Everything's great
in the sweet summertime *

96
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,185
* Anticipating
that sweet sweet *

97
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:44,691
* Sweet summertime *

98
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,818
* What time is it? *

99
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,946
* Sweet summertime *

100
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,284
* What time is it? **

101
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,288
Hey, look.

102
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,000
We finally made it, George.

103
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,627
The Comfy Cod Bed
and Breakfast.

104
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,214
* Up and up *

105
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,092
* And down down down
down down down down down *

106
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,515
* And back up again *

107
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,934
* Up and up and up and up *

108
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,896
* And the ship sank down *

109
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,648
* Diddly-down
down down down down *

110
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,860
* And down down and up
and up and up *

111
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,367
Uh, uh.

112
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,910
Hello?

113
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,455
Uh, uh. Ahoy!

114
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,540
I'm Captain Elmer.

115
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,209
Come in, come in.

116
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,753
Ooh.

117
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,551
Oh, here.

118
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,886
I made you

119
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,181
a welcome snack platter.

120
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,479
Uh, mini-marshmallows

121
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,314
with cheese balls?

122
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,900
Also a great bait for fish.

123
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,068
Hm.

124
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,405
I'm sorta new at this

125
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,699
Bed and Breakfast stuff.

126
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,207
I'm usually a fisherman.

127
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,293
Fisherman.

128
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,047
Never would have guessed.

129
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,218
Ooh, that's a hook remover.

130
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,387
Yeah, yeah.

131
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,430
Found it with my

132
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,224
trusty metal detector.

133
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,311
Along with all
these little treasures.

134
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,567
And there's more

135
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,444
where that came from.

136
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,946
The ocean's full of treasures,

137
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,365
mysteries, and adventures.

138
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,042
Ever work one of those before?

139
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,712
I knew straight-off

140
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,589
you were a sea monkey.

141
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,049
Uh-uh.

142
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,639
Now let's see how you cast.

143
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,189
This monkey's a natural.

144
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,648
Now reel it in.

145
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,318
Uh, take in the slack.

146
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,781
You hooked something.

147
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,491
Maybe it's a flounder.

148
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,742
Or a...

149
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,369
My niece Emma?

150
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,996
Hello, Hello.

151
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,831
Oh, sorry.

152
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,626
You must be the new guests.

153
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,044
Ted...

154
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,672
and George.

155
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,305
I thought I'd make your guests
some healthy welcome smoothies.

156
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:03,848
Uh.

157
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,475
A nice fried codfish

158
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,686
is what they're wanting.

159
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,562
Can't stop dreaming about cod,

160
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,731
can you, uncle?

161
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,205
You can take it from here,
uncle.

162
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,040
Well, bye for now.

163
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,878
Oh! Time to check the schedule.

164
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,881
Bedtime.

165
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,760
Oh, guess he runs
a tight ship, huh?

166
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:47,600
Well, your bedroom
is just this way.

167
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,326
Oh, hey look!

168
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,579
You can see
the lighthouse from here.

169
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,080
Ow!

170
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,088
Hm. Yup.

171
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,050
Looks like we missed
everything on today's list.

172
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,429
But we'll find a way to squeeze

173
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,222
it all in tomorrow.

174
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,153
See you in the morning, George.

175
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:01,026
Huh. I wonder who that
is with Captain Elmer.

176
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,569
She looks familiar.

177
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,198
Uh, no, no, let me show you
just one more, Gertrude.

178
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,701
I-- I found it last Tuesday.

179
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:10,952
Ta-da!

180
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,413
Looks historical, doesn't it?

181
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,374
Good enough for the museum?

182
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,627
Not even close.

183
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,756
Good day, Elmer.

184
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,610
Ahoy!

185
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,862
Oh, hey, captain,

186
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,447
who was that?

187
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,242
Gertrude St. John.

188
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,620
Head of the Coddington Museum.

189
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,498
The museum?

190
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,917
George, we're going there
this afternoon.

191
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,587
Oh, I hope it hasn't
changed too much

192
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,713
since I was a kid.

193
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,423
What? Changed?

194
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,550
I don't know
if it's even been dusted.

195
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,764
But hey, how about a tour

196
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,265
of Coddington Bay

197
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:17,602
in the Happy Clam? Huh?

198
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,145
What do you say, George?

199
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,691
Would you like
to be my first mate?

200
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,655
Oh, uh, boat trip

201
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,948
is scheduled for tomorrow.

202
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,449
We're actually supposed
to be building

203
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,451
sand castles now.

204
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,580
Oh.

205
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,875
Well, I guess if we move

206
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,546
this here, and this here...

207
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,507
we can squeeze
in a quick boat tour.

208
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,730
Oh, that's herring.

209
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,482
All fish love it.

210
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,693
Seals too!

211
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,543
Well, I think
the engine's in order, so...

212
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,008
Stand at the ready, helmsman!

213
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,694
Oh!

214
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:54,366
I coulda sworn
I'd fixed this thing.

215
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,285
- No.
- It's okay, George.

216
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,829
We're still on time
for sand castles.

217
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,090
Permission to go ashore granted!

218
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,349
Oh, but, George,

219
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,103
if you're gonna
be my first mate,

220
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:27,065
you'll be needing this.

221
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:29,818
An official Bosun's whistle.

222
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,613
Oh.

223
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,031
Well, keep practicing

224
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:37,450
and you'll get it plenty loud.

225
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,035
Ah.

226
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,954
It gets louder?

227
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,591
I did not get enough

228
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,218
sleep last night.

229
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:03,435
Okay, let's get started
on that sand castle.

230
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:45,620
* Take a good look *

231
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,164
* At this extraordinary day *

232
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:51,793
* So many new things to do *

233
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:55,630
* Wonders and mysteries
are swimming your away *

234
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:59,509
* To open up
your eyes for you *

235
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:03,847
* And all of a sudden
there's a brand new sea *

236
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:07,225
* Shining under the sun *

237
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:11,730
* Something that
you've never ever seen *

238
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:17,235
* Looks like
a whole lot of fun *

239
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,237
* And it makes
you wanna bounce *

240
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,365
* Like big bunch of bubbles *

241
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:26,327
* Flap your flippers and fin *

242
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:27,787
* Down down down *

243
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,748
* Go your troubles *

244
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,752
* As a brand
new adventure begins *

245
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:37,589
* Just like wave on the ocean *

246
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,384
* Laughs when
it meets the sand *

247
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:46,348
* You might need
a newfangled notion *

248
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,141
* You might find *

249
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:51,811
* A newfangled friend *

250
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:56,191
* Just by keeping
your eyes wide open *

251
00:21:56,232 --> 00:22:00,570
* You might win
the prize in the end *

252
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:04,282
* You'll find
a new kind of treasure *

253
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:07,202
* When you find *

254
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,622
* Your newfangled friend *

255
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:22,467
* You might find *

256
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:26,763
* A newfangled friend **

257
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:19,065
Yikes.

258
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:20,567
George?

259
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,153
Ah!

260
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,572
George!

261
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,533
It's time to go to the museum.

262
00:23:32,746 --> 00:23:34,789
George, if we don't stick
to the schedule,

263
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,750
we'll miss out on everything.

264
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,453
I don't remember Coddington

265
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,080
being so quiet.

266
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,165
Oh!

267
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,085
They must all be out getting
ready for Codfest.

268
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,640
Well, hello there!

269
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,559
Name any animal, and Rocco,

270
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:39,813
balloon-artiste, shall make it.

271
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:47,070
Okay, if it's quick.

272
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,203
A seal!

273
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,124
Coming right up!

274
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,796
Dadgummit!

275
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:10,510
Oh, it's my trusty
fish-hook hat.

276
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,014
I used to be a fisherman,

277
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:17,475
but you know
with the cod being...

278
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,144
Dadgummit!

279
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,646
Okay, hold on.

280
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:23,565
This for the tail,

281
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:26,276
twist that,
two flippers,

282
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,487
and, here you go,

283
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,448
one seal!

284
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,456
That's a seal?

285
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,249
I'm still in training.

286
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:52,218
Oh, hello!

287
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,511
I'm Gwen!

288
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:05,190
"Trumpet-Tooter
Meets the Crumpet-Looter."

289
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,816
Yours for a dollar.

290
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,986
Okay.
Here you go.

291
00:26:12,155 --> 00:26:13,740
Hey!

292
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,743
A pop-up Cod Cookbook.

293
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,995
Made it myself!

294
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:21,206
Wow!

295
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,499
I bet you'll sell a hundred

296
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,000
of those at Cod Fest.

297
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,337
Come on, George,
the museum awaits.

298
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,221
Ah, Codfest.

299
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,640
If only.

300
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,518
Here we are, George,

301
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:43,770
The Coddington Museum!

302
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,749
Plenty of fish
for chowdah there, Sam.

303
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,881
Really!

304
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:15,343
You say you were here
as a child?

305
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:19,222
Ah, yes.

306
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:21,474
Ted.

307
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,684
The boy who ruined

308
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,103
the Humpback Whale exhibit.

309
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,690
Just had to climb
over the barrier

310
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:31,526
to see what blubber feels like.

311
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:34,279
You can still see
your handprint.

312
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,447
Gee...

313
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,657
I forgot all about that.

314
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:42,078
Is that what I think it is?

315
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:48,126
Are you a Trumpet-Tooter fan?

316
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:57,385
"A sailor goes
where the wind takes him!"

317
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,814
"Never mind the gale!

318
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,399
Climb the mizzenmast

319
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:14,277
and find us land!"

320
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:25,622
Oh, my!

321
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,665
What tales!

322
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,294
In fact...

323
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:37,801
Did you know
that Trumpet Tooter's ship

324
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:40,845
was once spotted
in Coddington Bay?

325
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:42,472
You mean

326
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,557
Trumpet-Tooter is real?

327
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,727
He is!

328
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,521
And so is his ship.

329
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,356
The Shiny Cutlass!

330
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:54,901
Legend has it that

331
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:56,903
pirates stole
the Shiny Cutlass

332
00:28:56,945 --> 00:29:00,323
and then strayed off course
to Coddington...

333
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:06,788
They say a whale startled

334
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,040
one of the thieving pirates

335
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,417
and it caused him to drop

336
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,377
Trumpet-Tooter's spyglass,

337
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:15,046
somewhere in the Bay.

338
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:19,634
Has anyone tried
to look for it?

339
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,220
The story's probably
just a legend.

340
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:24,389
But it's fun
to think of Trumpet Tooter's

341
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,516
famous ship right here

342
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:29,227
in Coddington.

343
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:32,564
It had an extraordinary
figurehead!

344
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,399
A Hippocampus.

345
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,735
Half-horse, half-fish.

346
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:40,071
Trumpet-Tooter had it
on all his belongings.

347
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:58,381
Nice shell.

348
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:01,384
Hm-hmm.

349
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:08,725
Do you still sell those codfish

350
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:10,310
snow globes in the gift shop?

351
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:13,688
Right this way.

352
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:17,108
Hey, have you thought of
updating some of your exhibits?

353
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,819
Think I'm stuck
in my ways, do you?

354
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:55,105
The Atlantic Cod!

355
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:58,024
Growing up
to 200 pounds.

356
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:02,696
That's a lot of fish sticks.

357
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:32,934
Your monkey is
in the cod school.

358
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,519
In the what?

359
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,688
The sign clearly states

360
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,482
"No Riding the Mechanical Cod."

361
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:42,777
Oh, dear.

362
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,260
Uh-oh!

363
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,223
George?

364
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,610
I don't blame you.

365
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,362
Anybody raised by this one

366
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:28,239
is bound to become
a troublemaker.

367
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:34,996
I'll of course pay for any cod

368
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:36,581
and blubber damages.

369
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:41,002
Follow me to my office

370
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:43,213
where I will figure
out the damages.

371
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:47,258
Why don't you wait
for me here, George.

372
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:50,220
On second thought,

373
00:32:50,261 --> 00:32:53,098
how about I meet you
back at the Comfy Cod, okay?

374
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:55,141
Okay.

375
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:01,332
Hm.

376
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:10,193
Well, a whole day

377
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:11,861
treasure-hunting and just

378
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:14,114
a horseshoe to show for it.

379
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,439
Oh.

380
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,858
I guess Emma came
back to make more

381
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:52,027
healthy smoothies.

382
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:10,128
Hmm.

383
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:14,007
Hi, George.

384
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,474
Hm?

385
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:27,395
* And the smoothie went down *

386
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,106
* Diddly down down *

387
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:33,943
Mouthwash!

388
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:53,963
Great Neptune's Knickers!

389
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:57,050
Uh!

390
00:36:57,092 --> 00:36:58,259
Oh.

391
00:36:58,301 --> 00:37:00,053
Hey, George!

392
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:03,431
Uh, did you bring
this seal here,

393
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,934
and make a fish-bait smoothie?

394
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:16,695
What do you have there?

395
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:24,744
Wow, the horses' heads
do look similar.

396
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,009
I found this washed up

397
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,720
on the beach years ago.

398
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:53,606
George, look.

399
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:58,445
Could this be
the lens cap

400
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:01,114
for Trumpet Tooter's spyglass?

401
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:05,076
If it is,

402
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:08,913
then maybe the spyglass itself

403
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:11,875
is still somewhere in the Bay!

404
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:19,215
Yes, George,

405
00:38:19,257 --> 00:38:20,967
crazy amazing.

406
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:26,431
I always dreamed

407
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:29,184
of finding a truly amazing

408
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:31,061
treasure out there.

409
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:37,484
Where did you find this?

410
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:44,491
Well, where did you find it?

411
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:51,956
The lens cap was
hanging from that?

412
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:56,961
Well, that's a tracking device.

413
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:58,380
It tells scientists

414
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,632
where the seal goes.

415
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:03,468
And I bet I know

416
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,345
who put it there.

417
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:11,142
Wow!

418
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,192
Come on.

419
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,820
We have to get to the COW!

420
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:23,321
Cow?

421
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:28,326
The COW is our nickname

422
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:31,621
for the "Cape Ocean
Wildlife Institute."

423
00:39:33,206 --> 00:39:35,542
I bet they glued the tracking

424
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,836
device on the seal pup.

425
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:13,455
Do we know that octopus?

426
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:17,876
So you're an octopus

427
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,711
and head scientist?

428
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:23,048
Well, we're short staffed,

429
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:25,008
which means I have a lot

430
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,301
of shoes to fill.

431
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,889
And tentacles.

432
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:32,182
Uh, so, Emma,

433
00:40:32,223 --> 00:40:34,225
George found a seal

434
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:36,353
with a tracking device, uh...

435
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:42,067
Okay, uncle, uh, in a minute.

436
00:40:43,777 --> 00:40:47,322
Yes, you're right,
it's lunchtime.

437
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,494
He did.

438
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:54,245
Every time I visit the seals,

439
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:56,373
I ring the bell
to call them over.

440
00:40:56,414 --> 00:40:58,458
So now the seals ring the bell

441
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,418
when they want me.

442
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,757
Shall we feed them?

443
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:16,601
Just toss 'em into their mouths.

444
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:18,436
* You might find *

445
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:21,773
* A newfangled friend *

446
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:27,112
* Well it makes
you wanna bounce *

447
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:30,198
* Like a bunch of bubbles *

448
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,618
* Flap your flippers and fins *

449
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,746
* Down down down
go your troubles *

450
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:40,834
* As a brand new
adventure begins *

451
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:44,421
* Just like a wave
on the ocean *

452
00:41:44,462 --> 00:41:47,799
* Laughs when it
meets the sand *

453
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:51,469
* You might need
a newfangled notion *

454
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,431
* When you find *

455
00:41:54,472 --> 00:41:58,518
* Your newfangled friend **

456
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:05,567
Your little friend has a knack
with seals.

457
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:08,319
Oh,  he sure does!

458
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:10,405
And he found a seal pup.

459
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:11,614
I think it's wearing

460
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:13,658
one of your tracking devices.

461
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,995
Wait, it was a seal pup?

462
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:18,496
A young seal?

463
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:20,040
Sure was!

464
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,543
Gee.
He's still alone?

465
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:29,090
Okay, uncle.

466
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:30,925
Let's see what
this little guy's been up to.

467
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:33,011
And see
where's he's been.

468
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:36,306
So maybe we can find
that spyglass.

469
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:38,016
Uh, spyglass?

470
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:44,856
This line shows us

471
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:47,192
where the seal pup has been.

472
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:48,193
Huh?

473
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:49,361
It looks like he's traveled

474
00:42:49,402 --> 00:42:51,071
all over the cape.

475
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:53,865
That's terrible.

476
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:55,492
It's gonna take us years

477
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:58,203
to find Trumpet Tooter's
spyglass.

478
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,372
Okay, uncle.

479
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:02,665
Enough about the spyglass.

480
00:43:02,707 --> 00:43:04,668
I think we need
to find the seal pup.

481
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,761
See?
There's the seal pup now.

482
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:16,429
Oh.

483
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:19,557
Heading to Seal Rock.

484
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,727
Oh, he's probably going
to his mother.

485
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,229
If I plug his location

486
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,398
into the satellite network,

487
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:28,900
then maybe we can see them both.

488
00:43:28,942 --> 00:43:31,403
Yup, there's Seal Rock.

489
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:34,572
It's home to hundreds of seals.

490
00:43:37,742 --> 00:43:39,411
Let's zoom in even closer.

491
00:43:39,452 --> 00:43:42,497
We might be able
to spot the pup.

492
00:43:51,464 --> 00:43:53,216
Good eye, George!

493
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:56,344
And that must be

494
00:43:56,386 --> 00:43:57,846
the pup's mother.

495
00:43:57,887 --> 00:43:59,681
Well, looks like she might be

496
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:02,350
tangled in some fishing line.

497
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:10,025
I don't know
how we can help, George.

498
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:12,569
When people approach,
the seals tend to panic

499
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,320
and flee into the water.

500
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:16,114
Some can even get hurt.

501
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:17,615
Oh.

502
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:25,290
Ah, it's time for the early bird
dinner, George!

503
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:34,257
Tell you what, George.

504
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:37,302
I'll keep trying to think of
a way to help the seals

505
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,220
and if I do, I'll call you.

506
00:44:39,262 --> 00:44:41,639
Okay?

507
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:48,313
George, you are in for a treat!

508
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:53,651
A Cod burger from the one
and only Codfather Restaurant!

509
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,824
Or maybe we should
get the codballs.

510
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:02,827
Or the Codaroni and Cheese!

511
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:04,537
Ah, heck, let's get it all!

512
00:45:07,874 --> 00:45:12,295
And here we are!

513
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:24,724
I-- I don't understand.

514
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:26,309
Closed!

515
00:45:26,351 --> 00:45:27,894
Yeah.

516
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:32,190
People came to the Codfather
for the cod,

517
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:34,359
but the cod aren't biting
like they used to.

518
00:45:37,696 --> 00:45:40,365
Well, they better start biting.

519
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:42,367
Cod Fest is in two days!

520
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:43,910
Oh, but surely you've heard.

521
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:47,580
Cod Fest was canceled
a month ago.

522
00:45:47,622 --> 00:45:48,623
Canceled!

523
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:53,336
I'm afraid you can't have
Cod Fest without cod.

524
00:45:54,796 --> 00:45:56,381
It's in the name.

525
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:57,799
The cod's been overfished.

526
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:01,094
So for now, no one's fishing.

527
00:46:01,136 --> 00:46:03,930
Hopefully, that'll bring
the cod back.

528
00:46:03,972 --> 00:46:08,768
But-- but this is <i>Coddington!</i>

529
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:23,783
I mean... without Cod Fest,

530
00:46:23,825 --> 00:46:26,077
why'd we even come here?

531
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,330
For the balloons!

532
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:44,262
Hmm.

533
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:47,432
George,
when the going gets tough,

534
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:49,517
the tough get going...

535
00:46:52,812 --> 00:46:55,940
To another town.

536
00:46:55,982 --> 00:46:58,151
We'll leave in the morning.

537
00:47:09,704 --> 00:47:11,206
Oh, I'm so sorry.

538
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:14,501
I thought you knew
Cod Fest got the heave-ho.

539
00:47:15,794 --> 00:47:17,212
Don't worry...

540
00:47:17,253 --> 00:47:20,006
I-- I worked up a new schedule
last night.

541
00:47:20,048 --> 00:47:21,925
Portotuna has a Tuna Carnival,

542
00:47:21,966 --> 00:47:24,010
and it's just five hours north.

543
00:47:24,052 --> 00:47:26,221
But-- but we're so close

544
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:29,974
to finding
Trumpet-Tooter's spyglass.

545
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:35,647
George, I promised you
a great vacation,

546
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:37,941
and that's what
we're gonna have!

547
00:47:37,982 --> 00:47:39,943
Ooh!

548
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:53,832
I had high hopes for Coddington.

549
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:56,668
But it's just
not how I remembered it.

550
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:03,508
Emma will make sure the seal pup
and his mom are alright.

551
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,343
She doesn't need our help.

552
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:14,477
Hi! I need your help!

553
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:23,820
So, are you ready for your trip?

554
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:25,238
Yup, we're all packed,

555
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,782
and we'll still make
Portotuna by nightfall.

556
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:31,995
Huh? No-- no, I mean your trip
to Seal Rock on the Magellan.

557
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:34,372
Trip to where on the what?

558
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:39,919
Our research ship,
The Magellan.

559
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:41,588
Oooh!

560
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,264
Argh. George, the pedal!

561
00:49:05,403 --> 00:49:10,575
Um, do I have time
to change my clothes first?

562
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:13,411
Sorry, Ted, we gotta go now.

563
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:27,258
* When the sun's in your eyes
and the wind's at your back *

564
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,594
* And the salty spray
is flyin' *

565
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:32,180
* There's a smile on your face
a skip in your step *

566
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:34,808
* And you know
there's no denying *

567
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:36,935
* The sea is always changing *

568
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:39,396
* She's ancient and she's new *

569
00:49:39,437 --> 00:49:42,982
* You're bold and brave
as you sail each wave *

570
00:49:43,024 --> 00:49:45,819
* With your hale
and hearty crew *

571
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,946
* Hey ho the wind does blow *

572
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:50,365
* It sets the seas in motion *

573
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:53,910
* Nothing's fine
as the briny brine *

574
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:56,663
* And a day out on the ocean *

575
00:49:56,705 --> 00:50:00,375
* Sailing on the ocean *

576
00:50:07,215 --> 00:50:09,676
* The sky above
is truly blue *

577
00:50:09,718 --> 00:50:12,095
* The sea below is too *

578
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:14,305
* The fish's roof
is the sailor's floor *

579
00:50:14,347 --> 00:50:18,643
* And so let's sing
this song once more *

580
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:30,071
* Hey ho the wind does blow *

581
00:50:30,113 --> 00:50:32,323
* And if you take the notion *

582
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:36,327
* To spend some time
on the briny brine *

583
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:39,039
* You'll have fun
on the ocean *

584
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:43,668
* The mighty brine *

585
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:46,004
* The ocean *

586
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,713
Uh?

587
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:45,563
George, are you okay?

588
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:49,484
It's best if we keep
those tanks secure.

589
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:54,572
They hold compressed air.

590
00:51:56,032 --> 00:51:57,200
Air, George.

591
00:51:57,242 --> 00:51:59,953
For breathing underwater.

592
00:52:02,872 --> 00:52:04,624
It's okay, George.

593
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:06,918
Nothing got broken.

594
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,253
Look!

595
00:52:08,294 --> 00:52:10,755
We're almost to Seal Rock.

596
00:52:20,223 --> 00:52:22,308
Oh, wow.

597
00:52:23,059 --> 00:52:24,644
Remember I told you

598
00:52:24,686 --> 00:52:26,021
how the seals here panic

599
00:52:26,062 --> 00:52:27,772
when humans get too close?

600
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:30,525
Uh-huh.

601
00:52:32,485 --> 00:52:36,698
Well, George is so good
at entertaining seals

602
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,492
that I thought we could reach
the seal pup's mom

603
00:52:39,534 --> 00:52:42,412
without scaring the seals
into the sea.

604
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:45,874
But it's gonna take
all three of us.

605
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,797
What size are you?

606
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:54,841
Uh, size?

607
00:52:56,676 --> 00:53:00,388
Sometimes I wonder why I bother
to make a schedule at all.

608
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:02,223
That's the spirit!

609
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:05,185
Hmm...

610
00:53:05,226 --> 00:53:08,855
If only I knew
where that Seal Pup was...

611
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:11,649
he could help us
find his mother.

612
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:13,193
Ohh!

613
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:31,086
I knew bringing you along
was a good idea.

614
00:53:44,432 --> 00:53:46,267
George.
Ahh.

615
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:48,353
You keep the seals entertained.

616
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:51,981
Ted and I
will follow the pup to its mom.

617
00:54:47,912 --> 00:54:50,331
<i>[whistling "Strauss'</i>
<i>The Blue Danube Waltz"]</i>

618
00:55:13,104 --> 00:55:16,900
That's one amazing monkey.

619
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:19,277
You have no idea.

620
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:23,114
Let's go.
Follow the pup!

621
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:26,534
This way. And try not to call
attention to yourself.

622
00:55:26,576 --> 00:55:28,286
Yeah, how do I do that?

623
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:29,871
Act like a seal!

624
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:32,207
Flop!

625
00:55:37,253 --> 00:55:39,923
More flopping!

626
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:11,454
Oh, hi there, momma.

627
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:19,879
That fishing line's
bothering you, isn't it?

628
00:56:21,756 --> 00:56:24,009
Don't worry,
we'll get this off you.

629
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,971
Uh, Emma?

630
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:32,392
I think they like
your herring smell.

631
00:56:32,434 --> 00:56:34,185
That's good.

632
00:56:34,227 --> 00:56:36,312
Keep them distracted.

633
00:56:36,354 --> 00:56:38,606
Yeah, but there's a lot of them.

634
00:56:38,648 --> 00:56:42,277
Okay. Come on! That tickles!

635
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:43,862
Oh, stop!

636
00:56:43,903 --> 00:56:45,280
Oh! Oh! Careful.

637
00:56:45,321 --> 00:56:47,907
Stop! Stop!

638
00:56:47,949 --> 00:56:49,826
Whoo!

639
00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:08,094
[George chattering the tune
of "The Blue Danube"]

640
00:57:18,938 --> 00:57:20,440
We'll keep her
at the COW overnight

641
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:22,442
to make sure she heals okay.

642
00:57:22,484 --> 00:57:26,154
But thanks to you two,
she's going to be fine.

643
00:57:35,121 --> 00:57:37,624
Hey, watch your fish-tossing!

644
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:40,502
Ahh.

645
00:57:40,543 --> 00:57:42,921
<i>That's</i>a submersible.

646
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:48,927
It's an underwater vehicle.

647
00:57:48,968 --> 00:57:52,138
I collect plant samples
on the sea floor with it.

648
00:57:53,056 --> 00:57:55,100
Ahh.

649
00:57:55,141 --> 00:57:56,810
Uh, George,

650
00:57:56,851 --> 00:57:59,020
I don't think
you should be in there

651
00:58:10,907 --> 00:58:12,659
Seatbelts!

652
00:58:13,993 --> 00:58:15,495
Bye!

653
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:23,086
We'll track 'em, catch 'em
and reel 'em back in...

654
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:25,505
I hope.

655
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:30,343
Woo-hoo!

656
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:33,513
* My my oh wow *

657
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:37,017
* Look at where
you are right now *

658
00:58:37,058 --> 00:58:40,145
* A place you never
thought you'd be *

659
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:44,858
* Right in the middle
of a mystery *

660
00:58:44,899 --> 00:58:47,736
Let's quickly
fire up the sonar...

661
00:58:47,777 --> 00:58:49,988
This will only take a second.

662
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,031
Uh.

663
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:58,163
Don't panic. It's probably just
like driving a submarine.

664
00:58:58,204 --> 00:59:01,791
I wish I knew
how to drive a submarine.

665
00:59:02,876 --> 00:59:04,627
Ohh.

666
00:59:04,669 --> 00:59:07,881
* Hey there ho there *

667
00:59:07,922 --> 00:59:11,468
* Everywhere you go there *

668
00:59:11,509 --> 00:59:14,637
* You're moving fast
and floating free *

* Right in the middle
of a mystery *

670
00:59:18,224 --> 00:59:20,977
- Sorry!
- Ta-ta!

671
00:59:22,562 --> 00:59:24,064
Yes!

672
00:59:24,105 --> 00:59:25,690
Gotcha!

673
00:59:25,732 --> 00:59:27,567
Let's go get 'em!

674
00:59:29,944 --> 00:59:32,822
Hang on tight, guys.
Here we come!

675
00:59:32,864 --> 00:59:38,370
* Everyday that dawns
is an open door *

676
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:39,829
What is that?

677
00:59:39,871 --> 00:59:44,542
* To a world
that you never knew before *

678
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:49,464
* Everywhere you turn *

679
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:53,802
* There's something new
to understand *

680

* Nothing like your plan *

681
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,556
* Ain't that grand? *

682
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,569
Oh, dear, they're headed for the
edge of the continental shelf.

683
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:14,989
It's a mile drop
straight down!

684
01:00:16,282 --> 01:00:18,368
We got this.

685
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:21,496
* All the mysteries *

686
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:23,998
* Full of curiosity *

687
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,083
Oh, boy!

688
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:27,919
* There's no better
place to be *

689
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:29,629
* Than right in the middle *

690
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:31,256
We can't stop!

691
01:00:31,297 --> 01:00:32,716
* Smack-dab in the middle *

692
01:00:32,757 --> 01:00:34,592
Whoa!
.

693
01:00:34,634 --> 01:00:37,387
* Way down in the middle *

694
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:40,140
* Of a mystery *

695
01:00:43,435 --> 01:00:45,311
poof

696
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:53,778
Oh, wow!

697
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,406
I guess when the vehicle
gets too deep,

698
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:58,575
it triggers safety balloons.

699
01:00:58,616 --> 01:01:00,702
Hah! Who knew?

700
01:01:01,578 --> 01:01:03,997
Ooh.

701
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:08,126
Wow!

702
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,217
What? What?

703
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:42,327
Oh, good.

704
01:01:43,953 --> 01:01:46,331
Bet you guys
had an amazing adventure.

705
01:01:51,336 --> 01:01:53,046
You saw a horse?

706
01:01:55,382 --> 01:01:58,468
I know. A seahorse!

707
01:02:08,853 --> 01:02:10,939
Boy, you are <i>really</i>excited

708
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:13,817
to pack the car
and get to Portotuna, huh?

709
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,778
The museum?

710
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,279
Oh, no George,

711
01:02:18,321 --> 01:02:21,449
Gertrude St. John
will never let us back in there!

712
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:26,913
Hmm.

713
01:02:36,214 --> 01:02:37,507
George!

714
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:39,884
You gorgeous simian!

715
01:02:39,926 --> 01:02:41,219
Look at this!

716
01:02:45,181 --> 01:02:46,891
Captain Elmer?

717
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:50,061
Well, since that spyglass
hasn't turned up yet,

718
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:53,982
I figured I just <i>had</i>
to show Gertrude the lens cap.

719
01:02:54,024 --> 01:02:57,902
This certainly is
Trumpet Tooter's lens cap.

720
01:02:57,944 --> 01:03:03,366
And I believe Trumpet-Tooter's
spyglass is out there too.

721
01:03:14,711 --> 01:03:16,755
Oh, my God!

722
01:03:16,796 --> 01:03:18,882
George, you're not saying

723
01:03:18,923 --> 01:03:21,009
Trumpet Tooter's whole ship

724
01:03:21,051 --> 01:03:23,136
is out there, are you?

725
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,599
Wait!

726
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:30,602
You saw <i>this</i>figurehead?

727
01:03:30,643 --> 01:03:32,771
Uh-huh.

728
01:03:32,812 --> 01:03:34,439
Underwater?

729
01:03:35,982 --> 01:03:41,321
We, um, did have a little
underwater adventure.

730
01:03:43,323 --> 01:03:46,159
Is it possible the ship
actually sank here?

731
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:48,787
Well, the legend
only states that

732
01:03:48,828 --> 01:03:51,164
after the ship
wandered into Coddington,

733
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:53,708
it was never seen again, so...

734
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,835
So the Shiny Cutlass

735
01:03:55,877 --> 01:03:59,506
could very well be
at the bottom of our Bay!

736
01:03:59,547 --> 01:04:01,758
George,

737
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,177
if you're right about this...

738
01:04:04,219 --> 01:04:07,639
Coddington will become
a destination again.

739
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:10,809
And thrive
'til the cod come back!

740
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:16,439
Do you think you could take us
to that same spot tomorrow?

741
01:04:18,483 --> 01:04:21,027
Wait... Tomorrow?

742
01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:23,321
But that would mean...

743
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:32,580
I guess it means

744
01:04:32,622 --> 01:04:34,457
I don't need this schedule

745
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:38,503
because "This sailor goes
where the wind takes him!"

746
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:40,839
Let's go find a ship!

747
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:52,434
Oh, yeah. Of course...

748
01:05:13,747 --> 01:05:15,665
Let's head out!

749
01:05:26,509 --> 01:05:27,719
Wow.

750
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:30,680
What are all
these people doing here?

751
01:05:30,722 --> 01:05:33,725
Oh, guess word got around...

752
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:35,935
We may have made a few calls.

753
01:05:36,728 --> 01:05:38,813
This is all for us?

754
01:05:42,525 --> 01:05:44,319
Good luck, George!

755
01:05:44,361 --> 01:05:45,945
You can do it!

756
01:05:47,655 --> 01:05:49,824
Oh, my.

757
01:06:07,884 --> 01:06:10,553
Look, George.
There's our buoy.

758
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:16,267
And that's near where you
spotted the hippocampus, right?

759
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:17,519
Uh-huh.

760
01:06:20,647 --> 01:06:24,526
So are you boys ready
for another adventure?

761
01:06:27,153 --> 01:06:29,614
This certainly
wasn't on the schedule.

762
01:06:34,911 --> 01:06:36,705
Lead the way, George.

763
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:50,135
Gee, when you're not
in a runaway submersible,

764
01:06:50,176 --> 01:06:53,304
it's actually
kind of nice down here.

765
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:35,722
Oh, I see something.

766
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:39,017
Is it the hippocampus?

767
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:41,770
The mythical
sea-horse!

768
01:07:45,231 --> 01:07:49,527
Well, it <i>is</i>a seahorse.

769
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:10,256
Sorry, George,
but this must be it.

770
01:08:10,298 --> 01:08:13,593
There's nothing else
around here.

771
01:08:51,339 --> 01:08:53,049
Come in,
Happy Clam.

772
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:55,176
Did you find the ship?

773
01:08:55,218 --> 01:08:58,596
Negative. Just a towel.

774
01:09:04,853 --> 01:09:06,771
Oh, it's okay, George.

775
01:09:06,813 --> 01:09:09,232
Anyone can make a mistake.

776
01:09:09,274 --> 01:09:11,818
You did everything you could.

777
01:09:13,153 --> 01:09:15,864
It's time to say
goodbye to Coddington.

778
01:09:24,998 --> 01:09:27,917
Poor Coddington.

779
01:09:27,959 --> 01:09:29,419
* Wish I could find *

780
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:32,130
* Something better to say *

781
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:37,552
* This isn't the way
we wanted today *

782
01:09:37,594 --> 01:09:40,138
* To end *

783
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:43,391
* Oh, it's hard *

784
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:45,894
* Saying goodbye *

785
01:09:45,935 --> 01:09:48,730
* To a friend *

786
01:09:50,357 --> 01:09:54,194
* Trying to smile
but it comes out sad *

787
01:09:54,235 --> 01:09:55,528
Oh, George!

788
01:09:55,570 --> 01:10:00,158
* After all
the fun times we had *

789
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,994
* To spend *

790
01:10:03,036 --> 01:10:06,164
* It's so hard *

791
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:08,958
* Saying goodbye
to a friend *

792
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,211
George!

793
01:10:13,004 --> 01:10:15,757
* When summer is new *

794
01:10:15,799 --> 01:10:21,429
* Everyday seems
to last and last *

795
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:24,099
* Then you turn around *

796
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:29,979
* And somehow
summer is passed *

797
01:10:30,021 --> 01:10:36,569
* It all goes by so fast *

798
01:10:38,363 --> 01:10:42,367
* And though it hurts
having to part *

799
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:44,452
* I know in my heart *

800
01:10:44,494 --> 01:10:47,706
* We'll find ourselves here *

801
01:10:47,747 --> 01:10:50,166
* Oh, yeah *

802
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:53,294
* But until then *

803
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:57,716
* Guess I'm saying goodbye
to a friend *

804
01:10:59,926 --> 01:11:02,887
* And it's hard *

805
01:11:02,929 --> 01:11:07,142
* Saying goodbye *

806
01:11:07,183 --> 01:11:12,439
* To a friend **

807
01:12:57,544 --> 01:12:59,838
Thanks again for your help
with the seals.

808
01:12:59,879 --> 01:13:02,841
And sorry the shipwreck
didn't pan out.

809
01:13:03,925 --> 01:13:05,510
At least you
gave us all

810
01:13:05,552 --> 01:13:08,430
quite an adventure, George.

811
01:13:08,471 --> 01:13:11,099
Thanks for everything!

812
01:13:11,141 --> 01:13:12,642
Let's go, George!

813
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:18,064
Bye!

814
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:29,909
What is it, George?

815
01:13:42,589 --> 01:13:45,175
Okay, George,

816
01:13:45,216 --> 01:13:46,259
we have a long drive

817
01:13:46,301 --> 01:13:48,136
and it looks like

818
01:13:48,178 --> 01:13:49,804
a storm's coming.

819
01:13:55,101 --> 01:13:56,186
George!

820
01:14:04,527 --> 01:14:05,570
George!

821
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:07,655
George!

822
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:24,589
What is it?

823
01:14:26,966 --> 01:14:28,468
Ah. Let me see.

824
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:32,138
It looks like
our seal pup

825
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,932
is ringing the buoy bell.

826
01:14:33,973 --> 01:14:37,352
It sure seems
to want something.

827
01:14:41,731 --> 01:14:44,234
You're right, George.
He needs our help!

828
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:48,613
Well... better safe than sorry!

829
01:15:01,876 --> 01:15:06,131
Um, where did all those boats
come from?

830
01:15:06,172 --> 01:15:07,882
When the alarm sounds,

831
01:15:07,924 --> 01:15:10,844
all of Coddington comes running!

832
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:31,406
George, wanna take the helm?

833
01:15:39,289 --> 01:15:40,832
Hold her steady.

834
01:15:40,874 --> 01:15:43,001
Point the bow at the buoy.

835
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:00,852
Hey, you two!

836
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:10,362
Yes, George.

837
01:16:10,403 --> 01:16:12,906
Something <i>is</i>going on
down there.

838
01:16:12,947 --> 01:16:15,867
Let's drop a camera down
and take a look.

839
01:16:42,268 --> 01:16:43,436
Right, George.

840
01:16:43,478 --> 01:16:44,979
There they are.

841
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:21,391
Yes, George!
The whale needs our help.

842
01:17:21,433 --> 01:17:23,935
Ahoy, Magellan!

843
01:17:23,977 --> 01:17:26,271
This is the coast guard.

844
01:17:26,312 --> 01:17:27,897
Everything okay?

845
01:17:29,315 --> 01:17:33,528
A humpback whale is trapped
under a collapsed reef.

846
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,613
Oh, dad, it's a whale!

847
01:17:35,655 --> 01:17:36,698
Oh, man.

848
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,616
He needs our help!

849
01:17:38,658 --> 01:17:40,869
Copy that.

850
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:43,246
And I just wish
I knew what to do.

851
01:17:43,288 --> 01:17:47,250
The whale can only hold
its breath for 45 minutes.

852
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:51,421
That's right.

853
01:17:51,463 --> 01:17:53,298
Whales need to breathe air

854
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,967
like monkeys and people.

855
01:17:59,262 --> 01:18:01,014
Wait, could we use
the submersible

856
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:02,640
to move the collapsed reef?

857
01:18:02,682 --> 01:18:04,476
It's not strong enough.

858
01:18:04,517 --> 01:18:06,436
And we're running out of time.

859
01:18:09,731 --> 01:18:12,442
George, what are you doing?

860
01:18:13,943 --> 01:18:17,280
Are you trying to give air
to the whale?

861
01:18:20,033 --> 01:18:23,661
I'm afraid it doesn't
work that way!

862
01:18:26,289 --> 01:18:27,457
Whoa!

863
01:18:27,499 --> 01:18:29,793
Oh, no! George!

864
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:36,216
George!

865
01:19:44,701 --> 01:19:47,287
There she blows!

866
01:20:14,272 --> 01:20:17,067
My word!

867
01:20:17,108 --> 01:20:20,028
I've spent my life here

868
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:23,448
looking for a single piece
of treasure,

869
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:25,575
and this little monkey visits

870
01:20:25,617 --> 01:20:28,328
and finds a 300-ton ship.

871
01:20:31,331 --> 01:20:32,582
George!

872
01:20:32,624 --> 01:20:34,834
How do you do these things?

873
01:20:38,838 --> 01:20:40,965
What do you say,
Gertrude?

874
01:20:41,007 --> 01:20:42,842
Good enough for the museum?

875
01:21:01,986 --> 01:21:04,864
I can't believe
it's been a whole year, George.

876
01:21:13,623 --> 01:21:16,793
-
- Gah!

877
01:21:16,835 --> 01:21:19,629
Of course, I remember
your bosun whistle.

878
01:21:26,636 --> 01:21:28,596
And your spyglass.

879
01:21:31,933 --> 01:21:35,437
Yeah, that seal
was really something.

880
01:21:40,233 --> 01:21:42,694
George, I so wanted you to have

881
01:21:42,736 --> 01:21:44,779
the same Coddington vacation

882
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:46,614
I had when I was a kid.

883
01:21:52,328 --> 01:21:53,246
That's right.

884
01:21:53,288 --> 01:21:55,999
You created new adventures

885
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:57,625
for both of us.

886
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:08,053
Oh, we gotta go!

887
01:22:11,681 --> 01:22:13,558
* Racing along *

888
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,143
* Don't ever care *

889
01:22:15,185 --> 01:22:17,062
* Sun in your face *

890
01:22:17,103 --> 01:22:18,938
* Wind in your hair *

891
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:21,691
* Humming a song *

892
01:22:21,733 --> 01:22:26,071
* And feeling so fine *

893
01:22:26,112 --> 01:22:27,489
* What could go wrong *

894
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:31,701
* In the sweet sweet
summertime *

895
01:22:37,082 --> 01:22:40,585
* Everything cool
everything quiet *

896
01:22:40,627 --> 01:22:44,089
* Don't need a nickel
to have a good time *

897
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:46,633
* The days are bright *

898
01:22:46,675 --> 01:22:50,762
* As a shining new dime *

899
01:22:50,804 --> 01:22:57,560
* It's all going right in
the sweet sweet summertime *

900
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:02,607
* Curious delirious *

901
01:23:02,649 --> 01:23:06,695
* There's just no way
you can be serious *

902
01:23:06,736 --> 01:23:10,156
* It's such a great sensation *

903
01:23:10,198 --> 01:23:15,078
* We're going on vacation *

904
01:23:15,829 --> 01:23:17,330
* Whoo *

905
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:25,964
* No need for worries
no frowns or frets *

906
01:23:26,006 --> 01:23:29,759
* Wherever you walk is
as good as it gets *

907
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:32,137
* Like a balloon *

908
01:23:32,178 --> 01:23:37,058
* That's starting to climb *

909
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:43,231
* Happy today in the sweet
sweet summertime *

910
01:23:51,406 --> 01:23:55,201
* No clouds in sight
no sign of rain *

911
01:23:55,243 --> 01:23:58,663
* When things are so right
no need to complain *

912
01:23:58,705 --> 01:24:04,544
* Me and my pal rocking
the rhythm and rhyme *

913
01:24:06,087 --> 01:24:12,052
* Everything's great
in the sweet summertime *

914
01:24:13,428 --> 01:24:17,057
* Anticipating
that sweet sweet *

915
01:24:17,098 --> 01:24:21,561
* Sweet summertime *

916
01:24:22,729 --> 01:24:24,856
* What time is it? *

917
01:24:24,898 --> 01:24:28,234
* Sweet summertime *

918
01:24:29,903 --> 01:24:31,780
* What time is it? *

919
01:24:35,742 --> 01:24:39,746
* Sweet summertime **

920
01:24:53,968 --> 01:24:57,222
* My my oh wow *

921
01:24:57,263 --> 01:25:00,517
* Look at where you are
right now *

922
01:25:00,558 --> 01:25:03,937
* A place you never thought
you'd be *

923
01:25:03,978 --> 01:25:09,442
* Right in the middle of
a mystery *

924
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:17,909
* Hey there ho there *

925
01:25:17,951 --> 01:25:21,246
* Everywhere you go there *

926
01:25:21,287 --> 01:25:24,374
* You're moving fast
and floating free *

927
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:29,546
* Right in the middle
of a mystery *

928
01:25:31,631 --> 01:25:34,843
* Oh the mystery *

929
01:25:34,884 --> 01:25:38,346
* It's as cool as cool can be *

930
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:41,725
* All the wonders you will see *

931
01:25:41,766 --> 01:25:44,477
* Right in the middle *

932
01:25:44,519 --> 01:25:47,272
* You're right in the middle *

933
01:25:47,313 --> 01:25:51,234
* Of a mystery *

934
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:07,792
* Right in the middle *

935
01:26:12,047 --> 01:26:17,469
* Everyday that dawns
is an open door *

936
01:26:18,762 --> 01:26:24,517
* To a world
that you never knew before *

937
01:26:25,352 --> 01:26:28,313
* Everywhere you turn *

938
01:26:28,355 --> 01:26:32,942
* There's something new
to understand *

939
01:26:32,984 --> 01:26:35,737
* Nothing like you think *

940
01:26:35,779 --> 01:26:38,531
* Ain't that great? *

941
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:50,418
* My my oh yes *

942
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:53,922
* What comes next
you'd never guess *

943
01:26:53,963 --> 01:26:56,549
* Happiness is yours for free *

944
01:26:56,591 --> 01:26:59,219
* When you're right
in the middle *

945
01:26:59,260 --> 01:27:04,182
* Of a mystery *

946
01:27:04,224 --> 01:27:11,064
* Oh the mystery,
full of curiosity *

947
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:13,858
* There's no better place
to be *

948
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:17,028
* Than right in the middle *

949
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:20,448
* Smack-dab in the middle *

950
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:23,201
* Way down in the middle *

951
01:27:23,243 --> 01:27:26,663
* Of a mystery *

952
01:27:31,918 --> 01:27:35,213
* My my *

953
01:27:35,255 --> 01:27:37,549
* Oh wow *

954
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:40,427
* You know you're right
in the middle *

955
01:27:40,468 --> 01:27:45,765
* Of a mystery **
