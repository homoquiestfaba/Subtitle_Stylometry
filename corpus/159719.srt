1
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:13,807
Man that is born of woman
hath but a short time to live...

2
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,498
...and is full of misery.

3
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,504
He cometh up and is cut down
like a flower.

4
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,680
He flee from us like a shadow....

5
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:34,553
l can hardly believe that Mr. Marley's gone.

6
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,490
He's at peace, Mr. Crump.

7
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:40,466
He's nowhere, sir. The truth is he's dead.
Dead as a doornail.

8
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:44,563
Though l don't know what
is particularly dead about a doornail.

9
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:48,772
l wouldn't think that a doornail
was the deadest piece of iron mongery...

10
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:49,969
...in the trade.

11
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:54,314
Why not say, dead as a doorknob,
or doorknocker?

12
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:57,882
Nail, knob, or knocker,
Jacob's gone and there's an end to it.

13
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:01,410
A mighty poor turnout
for such an important businessman.

14
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:03,953
Perhaps it was because of the day he died?

15
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:06,117
The day he died, sir?

16
00:02:06,427 --> 00:02:07,485
Christmas Eve.

17
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:11,862
But it would account for the lack
of grieving relatives.

18
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,032
At least he was spared that
in his final hours.

19
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:16,897
Great loss, sir.

20
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:20,540
We leave you to grieve in silence.

21
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,109
The firm of Scrooge and Marley
will miss your shrewd brain...

22
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:35,821
...and keen eye, Jacob.

23
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,519
We went through
some hard times together.

24
00:02:41,964 --> 00:02:46,697
But we pulled through and we thrived
on the idleness of others.

25
00:02:48,337 --> 00:02:53,206
Rest content, Jacob,
the firm we built together will prosper.

26
00:02:55,978 --> 00:02:57,070
l promise.

27
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:09,281
And a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year to you!

28
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:13,578
Merry Christmas, sir.

29
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:17,449
Merry Christmas, sir.

30
00:05:15,684 --> 00:05:18,812
l was wondering, sir,
if after seven years you would be...

31
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:21,856
...removing Mr. Marley's name
from the sign outside?

32
00:05:22,124 --> 00:05:25,423
No, time will erase it at no cost to us.

33
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:26,952
Yes, sir.

34
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:04,194
l was just getting some coal, sir,
for the fire.

35
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:05,759
lt's going out.

36
00:06:05,868 --> 00:06:07,426
Poke it, sir. Poke it.

37
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:57,284
A Merry Christmas, Uncle! God save you!

38
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:00,987
Bah! Humbug!

39
00:07:01,424 --> 00:07:03,984
Christmas a humbug, Uncle?
You don't mean it.

40
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:05,521
l do mean it, sir!

41
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:09,659
Merry Christmas.
What reason have you to be merry?

42
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:12,633
What right have you to be merry?
You're poor!

43
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:15,764
What right have you to be miserable, then?
You're rich!

44
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:17,032
Merry Christmas!

45
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:18,740
Damn your Merry Christmas!

46
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:22,739
What's Christmastime to you
but a time for paying bills without money.

47
00:07:22,945 --> 00:07:26,506
A time for finding yourself a year older
and not an hour richer.

48
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,916
A time for balancing your books
and finding every item dead...

49
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:33,215
...against you.

50
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,986
lf l had my way,
every idiot who went around with...

51
00:07:37,627 --> 00:07:42,291
...''Merry Christmas'' on his lips would be
boiled with his own pudding, and...

52
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:44,992
...buried with a stake of holly
through his heart.

53
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:46,399
Come, Uncle.

54
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:49,630
Nephew, you keep Christmas in your way.
l'll keep it in mine.

55
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:51,405
But you don't keep it.

56
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,133
Let me leave it alone, then.

57
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:54,967
l still say, ''Merry Christmas.''

58
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:57,274
That's all you do say
and much good it does you.

59
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:59,041
Much good it will ever do you.

60
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:01,583
There're many things
l've got a lot of good from...

61
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:04,848
...which haven't made me a penny profit.
Christmas amongst them.

62
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:09,585
l've always thought of Christmas
as a time for good, not a time for profit.

63
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,056
A kind, forgiving time.

64
00:08:12,595 --> 00:08:14,859
A time when men and women
can think of others.

65
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:16,990
lt's never put an extra penny
in my pocket...

66
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:20,229
...but l believe Christmas
has done me good, and will do me good.

67
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:23,196
So l still say, ''Merry Christmas, Uncle! ''

68
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,073
You said something, Mr. Cratchit?

69
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:30,407
No, sir.

70
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:35,250
Not a sound out of you or you'll make this
a truly Merry Christmas by losing your job.

71
00:08:37,987 --> 00:08:41,423
Uncle, don't be hard on Mr. Cratchit.
lt's all my fault.

72
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:43,783
You are quite the powerful speaker, sir.

73
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:46,619
A wonder you don't go into Parliament.

74
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,162
Don't be angry, Uncle.

75
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:52,861
-Dine with us tomorrow.
-Dine with you! l'll see you damned first!

76
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,332
But why?

77
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:55,701
Why did you marry?

78
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,630
Because l fell in love.

79
00:08:57,774 --> 00:08:59,742
Because you fell in love.

80
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:03,242
Love. Humbug.

81
00:09:03,313 --> 00:09:05,110
You won't come see me
'cause l'm married?

82
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:05,546
Yes.

83
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:08,176
Well, you never came to see me
when l wasn't married.

84
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:10,984
Good afternoon, Nephew.

85
00:09:11,054 --> 00:09:12,715
l want nothing from you.

86
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:15,524
l ask nothing of you.
Why can't we be friends?

87
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:16,718
Good afternoon.

88
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:20,089
l'm sorry you're so stubborn.

89
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:24,827
But l came here full of Christmas spirit.
So l say again, ''Merry Christmas, Uncle! ''

90
00:09:24,902 --> 00:09:25,630
Good afternoon.

91
00:09:25,702 --> 00:09:27,897
-And a Happy New Year!
-Good afternoon!

92
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:29,996
A Merry Christmas to you, Mr. Cratchit!

93
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:31,506
Merry Christmas, sir!

94
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:41,877
You find my nephew amusing, Cratchit?

95
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:45,077
He's a very pleasant fellow, sir.

96
00:09:45,322 --> 00:09:48,780
Yeah, you're another Christmas lunatic
like him.

97
00:09:49,326 --> 00:09:50,793
lf you say so, sir.

98
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:55,987
lt seems you doubt me, Mr. Cratchit.
What are you then?

99
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,490
Your clerk, Mr. Scrooge.

100
00:09:58,869 --> 00:10:02,361
My 15-shilling-a-week clerk.
With a wife and family.

101
00:10:03,006 --> 00:10:05,440
Yet you babble about Merry Christmas.

102
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,871
l'll retire to bedlam.

103
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:16,849
Sir, do you know this area?

104
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,044
Tolerably well.

105
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:21,852
We're new here. We're looking
for the offices of Scrooge and Marley.

106
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,825
Some 50 yards along on the right.

107
00:10:23,894 --> 00:10:27,057
Good. We're collecting
charitable donations...

108
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,859
...for the poor of Clerkenwell.

109
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:31,992
You are collecting money
on behalf of a charity from...

110
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:34,731
...Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge?

111
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:37,863
Yes and Mr. Marley and other businessmen
of the neighborhood.

112
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:41,570
Yes, we think Christmas Eve is the most
appropriate time for giving freely.

113
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,283
This is the office of Scrooge and Marley?

114
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:52,419
lt is, sir.

115
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,383
May l press your cudiles, sir.

116
00:10:57,394 --> 00:11:00,261
Do l have the honor of addressing
Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley?

117
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:03,856
Mr. Marley has been dead
these seven years.

118
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:09,365
He died seven years ago, this very night.

119
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:15,774
Mr. Williams and Mr. Foster.
May we offer our sympathy?

120
00:11:16,513 --> 00:11:19,448
Why? You're not relatives, are you?

121
00:11:19,783 --> 00:11:22,946
No, but we feel sure you must be thinking
about him at this time.

122
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,987
And l'm sure his generosity is represented
by his surviving partner.

123
00:11:30,394 --> 00:11:33,522
At this festive time of the year,
it's surely desirable...

124
00:11:33,597 --> 00:11:37,658
...that we make some slight provision
for the poor and destitute...

125
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:39,363
...don't you agree?

126
00:11:41,872 --> 00:11:46,866
l take it that you gentlemen
are new to the district?

127
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:49,275
New and eager, sir!

128
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:50,739
You will agree...

129
00:11:50,815 --> 00:11:53,943
...that many thousands of people
lack the basic necessities...

130
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:56,953
...and many hundreds of thousands
lack ordinary comforts.

131
00:11:57,288 --> 00:11:58,585
Are there no prisons?

132
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:00,813
Plenty of prisons, sir.

133
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:03,827
And the union workhouses?
Are they still in operation?

134
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:06,693
Yes, they are.
l only wish l could say they were not.

135
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:12,264
A few of us are endeavoring to raise a fund
to buy the poor some meat...

136
00:12:12,337 --> 00:12:14,498
...and drink and means of warmth.

137
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:17,873
How much may we put you down for,
Mr. Scrooge?

138
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:22,501
Nothing.

139
00:12:24,382 --> 00:12:26,009
You wish to remain anonymous?

140
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:29,753
l wish to be left alone.

141
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:35,284
l don't make merry myself
at Christmas time and l can't afford...

142
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,023
...to make idle people merry.
l support those institutions...

143
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:42,533
...l have mentioned,
and l expect the poor to make use of them.

144
00:12:42,834 --> 00:12:44,893
Those who are badly off must go there.

145
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,835
Many cannot go there
and many would rather die.

146
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,838
lf they would rather die, they'd better do it
and decrease the surplus population.

147
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,645
Mr. Cratchit would you show
these gentlemen out?

148
00:13:30,648 --> 00:13:32,206
l'm going to try Scrooge's.

149
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:34,250
No, don't do that.

150
00:13:36,954 --> 00:13:40,185
''Good King Wenceslas looked out

151
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:43,990
''On the feast of Stephen

152
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:47,660
''When the snow lay round about

153
00:13:48,032 --> 00:13:51,297
''Deep and crisp and even

154
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:55,001
''Brightly shown the moon that night

155
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:58,369
''Though the frost was cruel

156
00:13:58,743 --> 00:14:01,268
''When a poor man came in...''

157
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,269
lt's Scrooge!

158
00:14:03,414 --> 00:14:04,574
Run!

159
00:14:05,116 --> 00:14:06,378
Away with you.

160
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:35,072
You'll want all day tomorrow, l suppose?

161
00:14:35,646 --> 00:14:37,136
lf it's convenient, sir.

162
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:38,546
lt's not convenient!

163
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:42,082
And it's not fair.

164
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:46,056
lf l was to deduct half a crown
for you taking the day off...

165
00:14:46,123 --> 00:14:48,489
...you'd think yourself ill-used.
l'll be bound.

166
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,656
But you don't think me ill-used when
l pay you a day's wages for no work.

167
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:54,455
lt's only once a year, sir.

168
00:14:56,935 --> 00:15:00,462
Fine excuse for picking a man's pocket...

169
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:02,734
...every 25th of December.

170
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,408
l suppose you must have the whole day.

171
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,571
You'll be here all the earlier
the next morning.

172
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,783
Yes, sir. Merry....

173
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:17,214
You were about to say something,
Cratchit?

174
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:18,345
Nothing, sir.

175
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:01,257
Jacob.

176
00:16:03,335 --> 00:16:04,734
Jacob Marley.

177
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,343
Humbug.

178
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,537
lndigestion.

179
00:19:06,753 --> 00:19:08,812
No. l won't believe it.

180
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:24,766
What business do you want with me?

181
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:25,735
Much.

182
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,199
Who are you, sir?

183
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:30,265
Ask me who l was.

184
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:33,238
Very well, who were you then?

185
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,943
ln life, l was your partner.

186
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:39,517
Jacob Marley.

187
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:43,948
Can you sit down?

188
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:45,053
l can.

189
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:47,124
Well, do it then.

190
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,105
You don't believe in me?

191
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:07,208
l don't.

192
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:10,710
Why do you doubt your senses?

193
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:15,277
Because little things upset them.

194
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:19,224
An upset stomach can put them
quite out of order.

195
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:23,251
You could be a crumb of moldy cheese.
An underdone turnip.

196
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,764
Moldy cheese?

197
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:28,633
An underdone turnip?

198
00:20:28,868 --> 00:20:32,599
Or some British beef. That can be mighty
upsetting to the stomach.

199
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:37,342
There's more gravy than grave
about you, Jacob!

200
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:51,413
What is it? Speak up, man!

201
00:21:05,906 --> 00:21:10,775
Why do spirits walk the earth?

202
00:21:12,045 --> 00:21:13,945
Why do they come to me?

203
00:21:15,449 --> 00:21:19,783
lt is required of every man
that the spirit within him...

204
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:22,513
...should walk abroad
among his fellow men...

205
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,414
...and travel far and wide.

206
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:27,686
And if that spirit goes not forth in life...

207
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,891
...it is condemned to do so after death.

208
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,759
lt is doomed to wander through the world.

209
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:37,631
Woe is me!

210
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:41,106
And witness what it cannot share...

211
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:45,937
...but might have shared on earth,
and turned to happiness!

212
00:21:47,414 --> 00:21:49,348
You're fettered. Tell me why?

213
00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:52,784
l wear the chain l forged in life.

214
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,812
l made it link by link and yard by yard.

215
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:00,416
lt is a ponderous chain.

216
00:22:01,762 --> 00:22:04,754
Do you know the weight and length
of the strong coil you bear?

217
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:08,862
lt was as heavy and as long as this
seven Christmas Eve's ago.

218
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:11,229
You have labored on it since.

219
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,872
Jacob! Jacob Marley.

220
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:20,170
Speak comfort to me, Jacob.

221
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:23,883
l have none to give. l cannot rest.

222
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:26,218
l cannot stay.

223
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:28,713
l cannot linger anywhere.

224
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:33,453
Never to be able to make amends
for missed opportunities.

225
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:37,125
The torture of remorse.

226
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,361
l don't understand why you're suffering?

227
00:22:43,704 --> 00:22:47,196
All your life you were a good businessman.

228
00:22:47,341 --> 00:22:49,036
That's why l'm suffering!

229
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:51,543
The suffering l caused others
is being repaid.

230
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:54,713
Jacob, it was business!

231
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:59,147
Business? Mankind was my business!

232
00:22:59,686 --> 00:23:02,177
The common good was my business.

233
00:23:03,657 --> 00:23:07,855
At this time of the rolling year,
l suffer most.

234
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:14,556
Why l can appear to you tonight in a shape
that you can see, l do not know.

235
00:23:14,634 --> 00:23:17,034
But l have sat invisible beside you...

236
00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:19,832
...many and many a day,
trying to reach you.

237
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,666
Listen to me, Ebenezer,
my time on earth is nearly gone.

238
00:23:24,244 --> 00:23:27,543
l'm here to warn you
that you have a chance of escaping...

239
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:30,013
...my terrible fate.

240
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:33,084
A chance l got for you.

241
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,513
You were always a good friend to me.

242
00:23:35,822 --> 00:23:38,620
You will be haunted by three spirits.

243
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,853
-ls this the chance you spoke of?
-lt is.

244
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,293
Then, l'd rather not.

245
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:47,390
Without their visits,
you've no hope of escaping your fate.

246
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:51,394
Expect the first tomorrow,
when the bell tolls 1 :00.

247
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,871
Couldn't they come at once,
get it done with?

248
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,841
Expect the second spirit on the next night
at the same time.

249
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,846
The third, the night following at 12:00.

250
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:10,386
Look to see me no more...

251
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:13,523
...and for your own sake...

252
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:16,357
...remember what has passed between us.

253
00:25:03,177 --> 00:25:06,010
These spirits try to interfere...

254
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:08,139
...for good in human affairs.

255
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:12,681
But they've lost the power forever.

256
00:25:16,657 --> 00:25:18,682
That is the curse we bear.

257
00:25:50,691 --> 00:25:51,988
A quarter past.

258
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:56,355
Half past.

259
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:01,232
A quarter to it.

260
00:26:04,872 --> 00:26:06,237
The hour itself.

261
00:26:07,575 --> 00:26:09,042
Nothing's happened.

262
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:23,716
Are you the spirit,
whose coming was foretold?

263
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:26,390
l am.

264
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:30,464
Who? What are you?

265
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:33,160
l'm the Ghost of Christmas Past.

266
00:26:33,668 --> 00:26:34,760
Long past?

267
00:26:35,403 --> 00:26:38,964
No. Your past.

268
00:26:40,508 --> 00:26:42,874
Spirit, put on your cap. Be covered.

269
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:44,011
What?

270
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:47,673
Would you soon put out the light l give?
ls it not enough...

271
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:52,082
...that you are one of those whose passions
made this cap and forced me...

272
00:26:52,186 --> 00:26:54,177
...to wear it low upon my brow?

273
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:57,082
l'd no intention of offending you, sir.

274
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:06,526
Thank ye. What business brings you here?

275
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:08,530
Your welfare.

276
00:27:08,604 --> 00:27:10,469
Oh, well, l'm much obliged to you.

277
00:27:10,772 --> 00:27:14,674
But a peaceful night of unbroken rest
would've been more conducive to that end.

278
00:27:15,143 --> 00:27:16,735
Your reclamation then.

279
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:22,878
Come with me.

280
00:27:22,985 --> 00:27:25,715
Some other time perhaps. l'm not dressed.

281
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:28,654
l've a weak chest. A monstrous head cold.

282
00:27:30,425 --> 00:27:33,087
Rise and walk with me.

283
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,198
No, l'm mortal. l'm liable to fall.

284
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,410
All l have to do is touch you.

285
00:27:51,613 --> 00:27:52,637
There.

286
00:28:16,204 --> 00:28:20,038
Good Heavens! l know this place!

287
00:28:20,475 --> 00:28:21,840
l was a boy here.

288
00:28:22,444 --> 00:28:23,968
You remember the way?

289
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:28,040
Remember it? l could walk it blindfold.

290
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:36,622
l know these boys.
We went to the same school.

291
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:38,424
There's Jenkins!

292
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:40,454
And Tony Veck!

293
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:44,391
And...

294
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:46,998
...Benjamin Fish.

295
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,593
And Toby Bell.

296
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:52,762
Toby!

297
00:28:57,245 --> 00:29:00,043
They are only shadows of the things
that have been.

298
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:03,573
They can't see us or hear us.
They're going home...

299
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:06,353
...for the Christmas holidays.

300
00:29:15,697 --> 00:29:17,358
lt's my old school.

301
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,134
Why didn't you go home for Christmas?

302
00:29:57,773 --> 00:29:59,138
l wasn't wanted.

303
00:29:59,775 --> 00:30:03,712
My father turned against me
when my mother died.

304
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:06,546
Sent me away.

305
00:30:08,017 --> 00:30:09,780
Didn't want to see me, ever.

306
00:30:10,553 --> 00:30:11,485
That's hard.

307
00:30:12,955 --> 00:30:14,183
Life is hard.

308
00:30:16,726 --> 00:30:18,284
Let's see another Christmas.

309
00:30:42,118 --> 00:30:43,210
Fran!

310
00:30:46,355 --> 00:30:48,346
Brother! Brother!

311
00:30:48,424 --> 00:30:49,516
Fran!

312
00:30:51,627 --> 00:30:55,063
-What are you doing here, Fran?
-l've come to bring you home, Brother!

313
00:30:55,131 --> 00:30:56,792
Home! Home, home!

314
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,561
For how long?

315
00:30:58,701 --> 00:31:00,601
For ever and ever.

316
00:31:01,404 --> 00:31:02,769
Father's changed.

317
00:31:02,872 --> 00:31:05,033
He's so much kinder than he used to be.

318
00:31:05,608 --> 00:31:07,098
Home is like heaven now!

319
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:11,042
He spoke so gently to me one dear night
when l was going to bed...

320
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:15,045
...as l wasn't afraid to ask him once more
if you might come home.

321
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:18,178
And he said, ''Yes, you should.''

322
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:20,549
And sent me in a coach to bring you.

323
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,624
Fran! Come on!

324
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:31,726
-Come on!
-l'm coming, Fran.

325
00:31:32,301 --> 00:31:33,325
Hurry up.

326
00:31:55,358 --> 00:31:56,825
Such a delicate creature.

327
00:31:57,493 --> 00:31:59,188
But she had a large heart.

328
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:03,156
So she had. You're right.
l'll not deny it, Spirit. God forbid.

329
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:05,795
She died young.

330
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:07,060
Too young.

331
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,664
Your sister married and had children.

332
00:32:11,207 --> 00:32:12,299
One child.

333
00:32:13,242 --> 00:32:15,437
True. Your nephew.

334
00:32:17,647 --> 00:32:19,808
Fred...yes.

335
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:37,426
You know this place?

336
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,135
Know it?

337
00:32:40,937 --> 00:32:42,529
l was apprenticed here!

338
00:32:57,453 --> 00:33:01,389
Fezziwig. lt's old Fezziwig, alive again.

339
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:03,989
Yo-ho, Ebenezer! Dick. lt's 7:00.

340
00:33:05,862 --> 00:33:07,295
Dick Wilkins!

341
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:10,557
Why, bless me! There he is.

342
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,636
He was very much attached to me,
was Dick.

343
00:33:14,438 --> 00:33:18,431
No more work, boys.
lt's Christmas Eve, Dick.

344
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:20,604
lt's Christmas, Ebenezer.

345
00:33:21,678 --> 00:33:26,047
No more business. Doors closed,
shutters up, before you can say...

346
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:30,210
...''Jack Robinson.'' Yo-ho, yo-ho, quickly.
Quickly clear away.

347
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:32,778
Mind the ledger, mind the ledger.
Now then.

348
00:33:33,457 --> 00:33:36,221
Make more room for the dancing.

349
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:38,193
Hilli-ho. Hilli-ho, Dick.

350
00:33:38,462 --> 00:33:42,398
Hilli-ho, Ebenezer. That's right.
Shut 'em up, boys. Shut 'em up.

351
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,195
Doors next. Chair up. Chair up.

352
00:33:45,702 --> 00:33:46,999
We're ready ladies.

353
00:33:47,838 --> 00:33:49,601
Hold your horses, husband.

354
00:33:49,706 --> 00:33:52,698
Horses? Horses? l see no horses, my dear.

355
00:33:57,714 --> 00:33:59,773
Splendid woman, Mrs. Fezziwig.

356
00:34:00,817 --> 00:34:02,216
Little Eli Fezziwig.

357
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:05,518
Marigold.

358
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,154
Daisy and Lily Fezziwig.

359
00:34:10,927 --> 00:34:13,122
Ebenezer! Ebenezer! Do the trick.

360
00:34:13,263 --> 00:34:16,892
You want the trick, Master Eli?
Abracadabra...

361
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,931
...one, two...

362
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:22,435
...three!

363
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:26,435
Mrs. Fezziwig,
l thought you were on a diet.

364
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,605
l am but l need this to give me
the strength to go on with it.

365
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:35,144
Tuck in one and all. Eat heartily
before Mrs. Fezziwig has it all.

366
00:34:35,652 --> 00:34:38,382
And remember, remember, she's on a diet!

367
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:31,635
Your turn, Mr. Fezziwig.

368
00:35:31,842 --> 00:35:33,207
Not tonight, Mrs. F.

369
00:35:33,276 --> 00:35:35,642
Oh, persuade him, Ebenezer.

370
00:35:35,712 --> 00:35:38,840
lt wouldn't be Christmas
without you performing, Mr. Fezziwig.

371
00:35:38,949 --> 00:35:40,177
Oh, very well.

372
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,049
l could always coax him into it.

373
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:49,585
Silence, Ms. Fezziwig.

374
00:35:52,295 --> 00:35:55,958
''Everyone surely knows

375
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:59,866
''l want to marry Rose

376
00:36:00,337 --> 00:36:03,898
''l am not a one to pose

377
00:36:04,608 --> 00:36:09,171
''l want to marry Rose, but

378
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:13,777
''There's her uncle and her brother
And her sister and her mother

379
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:16,683
''Yes, her uncle and brother
her sister and mother, but

380
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:20,121
''Rose Rose Rose
l'm not going to marry all of those

381
00:36:20,391 --> 00:36:23,883
''Aunties in dozens and fat-headed cousins
ln row rows rows rows

382
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:27,495
''Rose Rose Rose
l'm not going to marry all of those

383
00:36:27,598 --> 00:36:32,228
''Aunties in dozens and fat-headed cousins
ln rows rows rows rows''

384
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:35,370
The Portsmouth Polka!

385
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:56,982
Fezziwig once said to me:

386
00:37:57,088 --> 00:38:00,524
''Ebenezer, when happiness shows up...

387
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:03,823
''...always give it a comfortable seat.''

388
00:38:05,196 --> 00:38:05,890
True.

389
00:38:07,265 --> 00:38:10,757
Giving people pleasure
is such a small matter.

390
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:15,233
He only spent a few pounds.
Three or four at best.

391
00:38:16,274 --> 00:38:18,970
ls it so much that he deserves praise for it.

392
00:38:19,076 --> 00:38:20,976
You don't understand, Spirit.

393
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:24,837
He had the power to make us
happy or unhappy.

394
00:38:24,982 --> 00:38:26,973
To make our work heavy or light.

395
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,780
What's the matter?

396
00:38:31,622 --> 00:38:32,486
Nothing.

397
00:38:33,891 --> 00:38:35,017
Looking back...

398
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,924
...perhaps things seem better
than they really were.

399
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:41,192
All this was a lie then.

400
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:44,726
The world changes.
You can't trust anything.

401
00:38:47,738 --> 00:38:49,399
But no...

402
00:38:50,908 --> 00:38:55,208
...it was just like this, right down
to the last mince pie and dance.

403
00:39:12,831 --> 00:39:15,925
The years change people.
l don't wish to look, sir.

404
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:17,399
You must.

405
00:39:21,073 --> 00:39:24,474
There's nothing the world is so hard on
as poverty, Belle.

406
00:39:26,345 --> 00:39:29,473
And there's nothing it professes
to condemn with such severity...

407
00:39:29,548 --> 00:39:31,539
...as the pursuit of wealth.

408
00:39:33,752 --> 00:39:35,583
You fear the world too much.

409
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,185
All your nobler hopes have merged
into the one hope of being rich.

410
00:39:43,328 --> 00:39:45,387
One master passion engulfs you.

411
00:39:46,598 --> 00:39:47,565
Money.

412
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,936
What of it? Even if l have grown wiser,
l've not changed towards you...

413
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:53,229
...have l?

414
00:39:54,206 --> 00:39:58,506
Our promise to marry is an old one.
lt was made when we were poor...

415
00:39:58,577 --> 00:40:01,637
...and content to be so
until we improved our fortunes.

416
00:40:02,881 --> 00:40:06,977
You are changed. When we promised
each other, you were another man.

417
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:08,074
l was a boy.

418
00:40:08,353 --> 00:40:12,084
How often and how keenly l have thought
of this, l will not say.

419
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:17,323
But l have thought of it
and can release you from your promise.

420
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:20,760
No, no.

421
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:23,861
Have l ever asked you to release me?

422
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:26,469
ln words. No. Never.

423
00:40:26,705 --> 00:40:27,694
How then?

424
00:40:28,006 --> 00:40:29,598
ln your changed nature.

425
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:32,370
ln everything that made me love you.

426
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:36,339
lf this had never been between us,
tell me...

427
00:40:36,448 --> 00:40:38,973
...would you seek me out
and try to win me now?

428
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:48,389
No.

429
00:40:49,828 --> 00:40:51,090
You think not?

430
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:53,160
l know you wouldn't, my love.

431
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:59,868
Speak to her.
Why doesn't he speak to her?

432
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:03,702
lf you were free today,
tomorrow, yesterday...

433
00:41:03,775 --> 00:41:06,266
...would you choose
a poor girl like me to marry?

434
00:41:06,812 --> 00:41:08,905
You who weigh everything by gain?

435
00:41:10,215 --> 00:41:13,013
No, there'd be no profit in it.

436
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:17,113
And if you forgot your principle of profit
for a moment and did marry me...

437
00:41:17,189 --> 00:41:19,657
...you'd regret it, my love, l know.

438
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,929
And so, l release you with a full heart
for the love of the man you once were.

439
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:36,129
May you be happy
in the life you've chosen.

440
00:41:44,282 --> 00:41:45,510
Go after her.

441
00:41:49,821 --> 00:41:53,313
Don't be afraid. Go after her!

442
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:25,213
No more. Show me no more.
Take me home.

443
00:42:25,658 --> 00:42:27,819
Why do you delight in torturing me?

444
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,324
Haunt me no longer!

445
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:33,417
Come in.

446
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,955
Come in and know me better.

447
00:43:39,131 --> 00:43:42,396
Have you never seen anything
like this before?

448
00:43:42,668 --> 00:43:44,033
Not in this house.

449
00:43:47,006 --> 00:43:50,134
l am the Ghost of Christmas Present.

450
00:43:52,111 --> 00:43:54,602
Haven't you met with others of my family?

451
00:43:55,448 --> 00:43:57,882
My older brothers who preceded me?

452
00:43:58,451 --> 00:44:01,352
l don't think l have, Spirit.
Have you had many brothers?

453
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,354
More than 1800.

454
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,251
A tremendous family to provide for.

455
00:44:08,861 --> 00:44:12,194
Spirit, take me where you wish.

456
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:15,124
l'd like to get it over and done with.

457
00:44:15,901 --> 00:44:17,232
Touch my robe.

458
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:55,167
Why do you sprinkle water onto the food?
ls there a blessing in it?

459
00:44:55,241 --> 00:44:57,539
There is. My own.

460
00:44:57,877 --> 00:44:59,936
Would it apply to any meal on this day?

461
00:45:00,012 --> 00:45:01,445
To any kindly given.

462
00:45:02,048 --> 00:45:03,743
To a poor one most of all.

463
00:45:04,317 --> 00:45:05,978
Why to a poor one most of all?

464
00:45:06,052 --> 00:45:08,350
Because it needs it most.

465
00:45:16,096 --> 00:45:17,427
Where are we going now?

466
00:45:17,497 --> 00:45:19,795
Mr. Cratchit's house, every Christmas.

467
00:45:20,233 --> 00:45:21,564
My clerk, Bob Cratchit?

468
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:24,160
The same Bob you pay 15 ''bob'' a week.

469
00:45:24,438 --> 00:45:28,374
Every Saturday he pockets just 15 copies
of his Christian name...

470
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:33,513
...and yet here l am, the Ghost of
Christmas Present, going to bless him.

471
00:45:38,185 --> 00:45:39,812
''Talk about a penn'orth of fun

472
00:45:40,587 --> 00:45:42,714
''Yesterday it fair took the bun

473
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:45,257
''ln came the broker's men
To collar our few sticks

474
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:47,793
''But we were up to all their tricks

475
00:45:48,095 --> 00:45:54,000
''We've all been having a go at 'em
We've all been having a go

476
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:59,829
''One's in the dusthold minus pants
The other's gone home in an ambulance

477
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:05,171
''Oh good gracious, didn't we make a show

478
00:46:05,779 --> 00:46:08,942
''Seventeen of us besides myself

479
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:12,112
''And, we've all been having a go

480
00:46:12,386 --> 00:46:14,980
''Oh, we've all been having a go

481
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:18,247
''Yeah, we've all been having a go''

482
00:46:18,592 --> 00:46:20,958
Let the punch get nice and hot, Belinda.

483
00:46:21,027 --> 00:46:23,359
Your father should be home
any minute with Tim.

484
00:46:25,565 --> 00:46:29,126
-Martha's here.
-Martha is here! Martha is here! Hurray!

485
00:46:29,202 --> 00:46:32,433
-You should see the goose, Martha!
-lt's such a goose, Martha.

486
00:46:32,506 --> 00:46:34,098
You'll not believe it.

487
00:46:37,744 --> 00:46:40,178
Bless my heart alive, my dear. You're late.

488
00:46:40,247 --> 00:46:43,580
We had a great deal of work to finish off,
so l slept in the workshop.

489
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,481
Then we had to clear away this morning.

490
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,248
She sounds like
a very hard working young girl.

491
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:49,947
She has to be.

492
00:46:50,023 --> 00:46:52,321
Never mind. So as long as you're here.

493
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:55,561
Sit yourself down by the fire
and have yourself a good warm.

494
00:46:56,129 --> 00:46:57,460
Here's Father coming.

495
00:46:57,631 --> 00:47:00,828
Father's coming?
Hide, Martha! Go on, hide!

496
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:15,447
Go, go, go. Whoa there, dobbin.

497
00:47:19,052 --> 00:47:20,451
Merry Christmas.

498
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,417
Merry Christmas, Father.

499
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,113
And so say all of us.

500
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,491
Come on, Tim. You need a wash.

501
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,063
l didn't know Cratchit had a crippled son.

502
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:33,299
Why didn't you ask?

503
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:37,566
Where's Martha?

504
00:47:39,706 --> 00:47:40,934
She's not coming.

505
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,764
Not coming?

506
00:47:43,643 --> 00:47:45,338
Not coming on Christmas Day?

507
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:50,615
Martha! lt's Martha!

508
00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:56,854
Of course, it is.

509
00:47:57,824 --> 00:48:00,315
Come on, girls. Let's get the table laid.

510
00:48:08,668 --> 00:48:10,158
How did Tim behave?

511
00:48:10,437 --> 00:48:12,769
As good as gold. And better.

512
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,869
Somehow he gets thoughtful
sitting by himself so much...

513
00:48:17,378 --> 00:48:19,938
...and he thinks the strangest things
you ever heard.

514
00:48:20,515 --> 00:48:22,244
He told me, coming home...

515
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:25,914
...he hoped the people saw him in church
because he was a cripple...

516
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:28,854
...and it might be pleasant
to remember on Christmas...

517
00:48:28,923 --> 00:48:32,017
...who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

518
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,692
Not many remember that,
you can count on it.

519
00:48:34,762 --> 00:48:36,821
l think he's getting better by the day.

520
00:48:36,898 --> 00:48:38,490
He's growing stronger, Mother.

521
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,196
Everyone go to the table.

522
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:43,259
The goose!

523
00:48:43,371 --> 00:48:44,338
ls it ready?

524
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:47,203
lt should be, it's been cooking
for the past five hours.

525
00:48:47,275 --> 00:48:48,640
Here you go, Tim.

526
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,834
And here's the gravy.

527
00:48:55,716 --> 00:48:58,276
The goose. The goose. The goose.

528
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:01,213
The goose. The goose....

529
00:49:15,069 --> 00:49:16,297
lt's beautiful.

530
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,065
lt's not there to be looked at.

531
00:49:18,306 --> 00:49:19,364
No, no.

532
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,606
You do the honors, Mother.

533
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,412
lt's a beauty.

534
00:49:33,621 --> 00:49:35,179
Where did you get it, Mother?

535
00:49:35,256 --> 00:49:37,952
The market. l left it late, so l got it cheap.

536
00:49:39,026 --> 00:49:40,550
Very clever, my dear.

537
00:49:43,464 --> 00:49:45,193
lt does smell good, l must say.

538
00:49:50,671 --> 00:49:52,070
lt's so tender.

539
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:53,398
lt melts in your mouth.

540
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,308
l love the gravy.

541
00:49:56,377 --> 00:49:58,072
lt's just sage and onion.

542
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,514
lt's a feast, Mother.
Only you could've done it.

543
00:50:08,155 --> 00:50:09,520
What do you think, Tim?

544
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,287
What'd you say, Tim?

545
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:14,521
Speak up, Tim!

546
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,187
Give the lad a chance.

547
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:21,494
lt's the best goose we've ever had.

548
00:50:28,643 --> 00:50:30,008
Tell me, Spirit.

549
00:50:31,145 --> 00:50:32,806
Will Tiny Tim live?

550
00:50:34,415 --> 00:50:36,474
l see an empty chair by the fireplace...

551
00:50:37,652 --> 00:50:39,677
...and a crutch without an owner...

552
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,547
...carefully preserved.

553
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:46,492
Unless, the future changes,
the child will die.

554
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:56,600
Wonderful meal, Mother.

555
00:50:57,104 --> 00:50:58,469
You done us proud.

556
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:00,998
The best is yet to come, Robert.

557
00:51:01,409 --> 00:51:02,706
Pudding!

558
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,543
lt might not be done yet.

559
00:51:08,716 --> 00:51:10,775
Mother might break it, turning it out.

560
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:13,513
Suppose somebody got over
the garden wall...

561
00:51:13,688 --> 00:51:16,384
...and stole it
when we were eating the goose.

562
00:51:16,591 --> 00:51:18,286
-Don't say that.
-They couldn't.

563
00:51:20,729 --> 00:51:23,220
-Oh, my goodness!
-Look at the flames.

564
00:51:23,298 --> 00:51:24,424
lt's great.

565
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:30,362
And there's the holly.

566
00:51:44,119 --> 00:51:45,643
Pass that to your father.

567
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,270
Well?

568
00:52:09,578 --> 00:52:10,476
Well?

569
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:14,276
This is without a doubt...

570
00:52:14,983 --> 00:52:18,441
...the greatest success you have achieved
since we were married.

571
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:24,857
l had my doubts about it.
l wasn't too sure about the flour.

572
00:52:25,994 --> 00:52:28,258
There's nothing wrong with that pudding...

573
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:31,561
...except it's very small
for such a large family.

574
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,165
Nobody complained.

575
00:52:33,335 --> 00:52:36,395
Any Cratchit would blush
at even the hint of such a thing.

576
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,529
Look.

577
00:52:41,143 --> 00:52:44,544
A Merry Christmas to us all.
My dear, God bless us.

578
00:52:44,913 --> 00:52:46,437
Merry Christmas!

579
00:52:46,681 --> 00:52:48,080
God bless us!

580
00:52:48,683 --> 00:52:50,708
God bless us, every one.

581
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:55,784
ls there no chance that boy will be spared?

582
00:52:56,958 --> 00:52:59,449
Not if the future remains unaltered.

583
00:53:00,495 --> 00:53:01,359
Hmm.

584
00:53:01,496 --> 00:53:03,225
But so what if it happens?

585
00:53:03,799 --> 00:53:08,327
lf he'll die, he'd better do it quickly
and decrease the surplus population.

586
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:10,035
Man.

587
00:53:11,373 --> 00:53:15,036
lf you be a man in your heart,
forbear that wicked cant...

588
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:18,944
...until you've discovered
what the surplus really is and where it is.

589
00:53:19,781 --> 00:53:22,909
Will you decide what men shall live,
what men shall die?

590
00:53:23,585 --> 00:53:26,452
lt may be in the sight of heaven,
you are more worthless...

591
00:53:26,521 --> 00:53:30,855
...and less fit to live than millions
like this poor man's child.

592
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:35,628
God! To hear the insect
on the leaf pronouncing...

593
00:53:35,697 --> 00:53:40,066
...that there is too much life
among his hungry brothers in the dust.

594
00:53:40,368 --> 00:53:41,767
A toast, children.

595
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:44,765
To Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the Feast.

596
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:48,007
Did you say, ''Scrooge,
Founder of the Feast?''

597
00:53:48,443 --> 00:53:49,603
Well, my dear....

598
00:53:49,678 --> 00:53:51,543
''Founder of the Feast,'' indeed.

599
00:53:51,947 --> 00:53:55,405
l wish l had him here. l'd give him
a piece of my mind to feast upon.

600
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:57,542
l hope he'd have a good appetite for it.

601
00:53:57,619 --> 00:53:58,950
My dear, the children.

602
00:53:59,354 --> 00:54:00,685
lt's Christmas Day.

603
00:54:00,755 --> 00:54:02,780
lt should be Christmas Day, l'm sure...

604
00:54:02,858 --> 00:54:06,294
...on which one drinks the health
of such an odious, stingy...

605
00:54:06,361 --> 00:54:08,795
...hard, unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge.

606
00:54:09,164 --> 00:54:10,631
You know he is, Robert!

607
00:54:10,699 --> 00:54:13,167
Nobody knows it better than you do,
poor fellow!

608
00:54:13,869 --> 00:54:16,394
My dear, Christmas Day....

609
00:54:18,975 --> 00:54:22,672
l'll drink to his health for your sake
and the day's, not for his.

610
00:54:26,015 --> 00:54:28,848
Long life to him. A Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year.

611
00:54:29,886 --> 00:54:30,978
A nice gesture.

612
00:54:31,621 --> 00:54:34,920
A long life to him.
A Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge.

613
00:54:35,324 --> 00:54:37,952
Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge.

614
00:54:38,227 --> 00:54:40,661
He'll be as merry as a graveyard
on a wet Sunday.

615
00:54:42,465 --> 00:54:45,229
Let's forget Ebenezer Scrooge,
and enjoy ourselves.

616
00:54:45,668 --> 00:54:47,192
Give us a song, Tim lad.

617
00:54:48,204 --> 00:54:51,605
''Silent night

618
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:55,177
''Holy night

619
00:54:55,945 --> 00:54:58,675
''All is calm

620
00:54:59,181 --> 00:55:01,877
''All is bright

621
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:05,987
''Round yon Virgin

622
00:55:06,455 --> 00:55:09,549
''Mother and Child

623
00:55:10,493 --> 00:55:16,489
''Holy infant so tender and mild

624
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:18,632
''Sleep in...

625
00:55:18,968 --> 00:55:22,870
''...heavenly peace...''

626
00:57:20,689 --> 00:57:24,091
He said that Christmas was a humbug.
He really did.

627
00:57:24,327 --> 00:57:28,195
lt seems the less Uncle Scrooge knows,
the more stubbornly he knows it.

628
00:57:28,598 --> 00:57:32,159
The narrower a man's mind,
the broader his statements.

629
00:57:32,903 --> 00:57:35,565
-That's we'll put, Mr. Bennett.
-Thank you, my dear.

630
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:38,972
Do you think he believes it,
about Christmas and humbug?

631
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:40,736
Oh yes, he believes it.

632
00:57:40,811 --> 00:57:42,278
More shame on him, Fred.

633
00:57:42,379 --> 00:57:43,505
That's what l say.

634
00:57:43,747 --> 00:57:44,975
More shame on him.

635
00:57:45,715 --> 00:57:48,149
lf you say so, so do l, Miss Betsy.

636
00:57:49,252 --> 00:57:50,310
Mr. Haines.

637
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:52,082
Please, call me Topper.

638
00:57:52,722 --> 00:57:55,122
Everyone l like calls me Topper.

639
00:57:55,358 --> 00:57:57,019
Oh, Mr. Topper.

640
00:57:59,963 --> 00:58:04,059
My uncle's a very comical old fellow,
but l'll not say anything against him.

641
00:58:04,134 --> 00:58:05,465
Heat the poker, Topper.

642
00:58:09,673 --> 00:58:11,231
You're so easygoing, Fred.

643
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:13,876
Why won't you say anything
against Uncle Scrooge...

644
00:58:13,944 --> 00:58:15,741
...after the way he's treated you?

645
00:58:15,812 --> 00:58:17,302
Why won't you, Fred?

646
00:58:17,481 --> 00:58:20,211
Because l think his offenses
carry their own punishment.

647
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:26,212
l've not patience with the man.

648
00:58:27,057 --> 00:58:29,924
Well, Mr. Scrooge certainly has
very few friends.

649
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,885
He's the most uncivil man l've ever met,
Mr. Bennett.

650
00:58:32,963 --> 00:58:36,524
He never says ''Good morning''
or ''Good evening'' or ''Merry Christmas.''

651
00:58:37,033 --> 00:58:39,297
He leaves a bad taste in people's eyes.

652
00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:43,237
Poor devil. Who suffers from his ill humor?
Only himself.

653
00:58:43,406 --> 00:58:46,807
By not making merry with us,
l'm sure he loses pleasanter companions...

654
00:58:46,877 --> 00:58:50,244
...than he can find in his own thoughts,
either in his moldy office...

655
00:58:50,313 --> 00:58:51,780
...or his dusty chambers.

656
00:58:51,982 --> 00:58:55,008
Anyway, l mean to keep
the door of happiness open...

657
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:59,081
...and give him a chance every year
to slip in whether he likes it or not.

658
00:59:00,457 --> 00:59:01,549
The poker, Topper!

659
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:21,268
-Topper, would you do the honors?
-My pleasure.

660
00:59:29,586 --> 00:59:32,316
l don't understand why your husband
defends Mr. Scrooge.

661
00:59:34,024 --> 00:59:37,323
lt's because his mother loved Scrooge so
when they were children.

662
00:59:38,795 --> 00:59:43,425
lf my mother loved someone, they must've
had a good heart in them, just as she did.

663
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:47,930
She gave that heart to you, my dear.
That's why l love you.

664
00:59:49,539 --> 00:59:52,770
They're talking about your little sister,
Fran, aren't they?

665
00:59:52,842 --> 00:59:53,934
Yes, they are.

666
00:59:55,412 --> 00:59:58,245
l sometimes forget
that Fred is Fran's child.

667
00:59:59,416 --> 01:00:00,678
You shouldn't.

668
01:00:02,586 --> 01:00:03,985
We have to go now.

669
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:11,959
Let's play Consequences
or Cupid's Coming.

670
01:00:12,028 --> 01:00:13,791
No, no. Dumb Crambo.

671
01:00:13,863 --> 01:00:15,353
Blind-Man's-Bluff.

672
01:00:15,732 --> 01:00:18,758
Let's play Blind-Man's-Bluff.

673
01:00:19,936 --> 01:00:21,369
Games, Spirit.

674
01:00:23,507 --> 01:00:24,496
Games.

675
01:00:25,243 --> 01:00:26,938
lt's been so long since....

676
01:00:28,746 --> 01:00:29,940
Let's stay a little.

677
01:01:02,713 --> 01:01:03,702
He's cheating.

678
01:01:04,115 --> 01:01:05,446
He's cheating.

679
01:01:06,017 --> 01:01:07,348
He is cheating.

680
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,594
Cheat? lt's an outrage.

681
01:01:26,771 --> 01:01:28,238
Pretty little nose.

682
01:01:31,575 --> 01:01:33,975
-And a little mouth.
-Mr. Topper!

683
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:35,839
lt's...

684
01:01:38,749 --> 01:01:39,738
...Betsy!

685
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:46,453
Forfeit.

686
01:01:46,524 --> 01:01:47,855
Oh, Mr. Topper!

687
01:01:48,326 --> 01:01:49,486
lt must be a kiss.

688
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,028
A kiss. A kiss. Come on.

689
01:02:00,705 --> 01:02:02,070
Now, we must go.

690
01:02:08,646 --> 01:02:10,580
Wait, Spirit. l need to hear.

691
01:02:12,616 --> 01:02:14,743
That was my sister's favorite tune.

692
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:16,884
Fran.

693
01:02:18,723 --> 01:02:19,655
Yes.

694
01:02:36,574 --> 01:02:39,008
You should've accepted
Fred's invitation to dine.

695
01:02:39,076 --> 01:02:39,974
What?

696
01:02:40,644 --> 01:02:43,875
For Fran's sake, if not for yours.

697
01:02:44,915 --> 01:02:45,939
l should.

698
01:02:47,618 --> 01:02:49,347
We still have much to do.

699
01:04:22,214 --> 01:04:25,911
You've grown old, Spirit.
Are spirits' lives so short?

700
01:04:26,585 --> 01:04:31,113
My life on this globe is very brief.
lt ends tonight.

701
01:04:31,756 --> 01:04:32,586
Tonight?

702
01:04:32,891 --> 01:04:34,119
Tonight at midnight.

703
01:04:35,861 --> 01:04:37,328
The time is drawing near.

704
01:04:38,997 --> 01:04:41,158
Spirit, forgive me, but....

705
01:04:42,234 --> 01:04:45,226
l see something strange
and not belonging to you.

706
01:04:45,303 --> 01:04:48,170
There, beneath your robe. ls it a foot...

707
01:04:49,774 --> 01:04:51,002
...or a claw?

708
01:04:51,243 --> 01:04:54,178
lt might be a claw
for all the flesh there is on it.

709
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:56,072
Look.

710
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,220
Spirit, are they yours?

711
01:05:04,289 --> 01:05:08,316
No, they are Man's. This boy is lgnorance.

712
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:10,618
This girl is Want.

713
01:05:11,029 --> 01:05:13,998
Beware of both of them,
but most of all beware of the boy.

714
01:05:14,399 --> 01:05:17,425
For on his forehead l see that written
which is doom...

715
01:05:18,169 --> 01:05:20,034
...unless the writing is erased.

716
01:05:20,805 --> 01:05:22,466
lf you deny him...

717
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:25,737
...slander those
who tell others about him...

718
01:05:26,077 --> 01:05:28,602
...admit he exists, but do nothing about it...

719
01:05:30,415 --> 01:05:32,315
...then doom will engulf you all!

720
01:05:32,851 --> 01:05:35,843
Are there no shelters?
No charities to help them?

721
01:05:36,254 --> 01:05:39,883
Are there no prisons?
Are there no workhouses?

722
01:06:14,793 --> 01:06:17,387
You are the Spirit of Christmas
Yet To Come?

723
01:06:20,532 --> 01:06:25,094
You are about to show me the shadows
of the things that have not happened...

724
01:06:26,237 --> 01:06:28,263
...but will happen in the time to come.

725
01:06:29,108 --> 01:06:32,544
l fear you more
than any of the spirits l've seen.

726
01:06:34,113 --> 01:06:35,410
Will you not speak?

727
01:06:42,722 --> 01:06:46,158
Lead on. Lead on, Spirit.

728
01:06:47,026 --> 01:06:48,755
The night is waning fast.

729
01:06:49,729 --> 01:06:53,130
lt is precious time to me, l know.

730
01:06:54,467 --> 01:06:55,456
Lead on.

731
01:07:06,345 --> 01:07:10,213
Ah, Spirit. The Stock Exchange.
Now l feel at home.

732
01:07:10,683 --> 01:07:12,014
l know these men.

733
01:07:12,385 --> 01:07:15,752
Here profit is worshipped
and profit is everything.

734
01:07:18,257 --> 01:07:21,454
l can't find out the truth
about old Scratchy.

735
01:07:21,827 --> 01:07:24,261
No, l don't know much about it, either.

736
01:07:24,563 --> 01:07:26,394
l only know he's gone.

737
01:07:26,565 --> 01:07:28,965
-When?
-Just last night, they say.

738
01:07:29,301 --> 01:07:31,769
What was it? l thought he'd never die.

739
01:07:31,937 --> 01:07:32,869
God knows.

740
01:07:33,339 --> 01:07:36,001
What about his money? Who'll get it?

741
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:38,104
Not me, that's all l know.

742
01:07:39,111 --> 01:07:41,602
lt's likely to be a very cheap funeral...

743
01:07:41,681 --> 01:07:44,377
...'cause l can't think of anyone
who'll be there.

744
01:07:45,051 --> 01:07:47,110
Do you think we should volunteer?

745
01:07:47,186 --> 01:07:50,883
l don't mind going if there's a lunch.
l must be fed.

746
01:07:50,956 --> 01:07:53,982
l never eat lunch,
and l never wear black gloves.

747
01:07:54,627 --> 01:07:56,686
So there's not much in it for me, but...

748
01:07:56,762 --> 01:07:59,060
...if you're making up a party....

749
01:07:59,932 --> 01:08:02,662
Let's just say...we'll think about it.

750
01:08:55,054 --> 01:08:59,491
What's this? An undertaker,
a laundress, and a charlady.

751
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:02,089
And all come at once?

752
01:09:02,762 --> 01:09:05,754
-lt wasn't planned.
-We're here by chance, Joe.

753
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:08,460
There's no conspiracy.

754
01:09:08,601 --> 01:09:11,263
lf l thought that there was,
you'd be out like a shot.

755
01:09:11,337 --> 01:09:12,895
l can't be too careful.

756
01:09:14,974 --> 01:09:17,306
As it is, you're welcome.

757
01:09:20,646 --> 01:09:22,443
How goes the day, Joe?

758
01:09:23,149 --> 01:09:26,312
l'm sure there's no bones
older than mine, Mrs. Dilber.

759
01:09:27,019 --> 01:09:29,044
We're all suited to our calling.

760
01:09:29,656 --> 01:09:31,055
Matched in heaven.

761
01:09:31,558 --> 01:09:35,517
l am a rag-and-bone man by trade
and a rag-and-bone man by nature.

762
01:09:36,863 --> 01:09:38,728
But trade is not what it was.

763
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:41,533
Why are you looking, Mrs. Dilber?

764
01:09:42,302 --> 01:09:44,896
Everyone's got a right
to take care of themselves.

765
01:09:44,971 --> 01:09:48,134
-He always did.
-No man more, Mrs. Riggs.

766
01:09:48,441 --> 01:09:51,569
lf he'd wanted to keep them
after he was dead, wicked old screw...

767
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:53,977
...why wasn't he more easy-like in his life?

768
01:09:54,381 --> 01:09:55,541
lf he had been...

769
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:59,374
...he'd had somebody to look after him
when he was struck with death...

770
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:03,385
...instead of lying gasping out
his last there.

771
01:10:04,024 --> 01:10:05,787
Alone there.

772
01:10:07,294 --> 01:10:10,559
Undo my bundle, Joe.
Tell me what the value is.

773
01:10:11,164 --> 01:10:14,224
Now, speak plain.
l'm not afraid to go first.

774
01:10:14,935 --> 01:10:17,995
We knew pretty well,
we was helping ourselves before we met.

775
01:10:18,171 --> 01:10:19,331
lt's no sin.

776
01:10:19,406 --> 01:10:20,930
Only if we get caught.

777
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:25,539
No chance of that. Nobody cared
what happened to him then nor now.

778
01:10:25,712 --> 01:10:26,804
Open the bundle.

779
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,280
No, ladies. Mine first.

780
01:10:30,016 --> 01:10:31,244
lt's the smallest.

781
01:10:36,723 --> 01:10:39,214
Meager pickings, Mr. Crump.

782
01:10:39,893 --> 01:10:40,882
A pencil case.

783
01:10:41,795 --> 01:10:44,628
Two sleeve buttons, and...

784
01:10:45,799 --> 01:10:48,825
...a brooch...of no great value.

785
01:10:49,436 --> 01:10:50,528
Seven shillings?

786
01:10:52,038 --> 01:10:53,005
Done.

787
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:56,774
Me next, Joe.

788
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:04,676
One sheet.

789
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:09,245
Four towels.

790
01:11:10,023 --> 01:11:12,856
An old shirt.

791
01:11:14,427 --> 01:11:16,054
Teaspoons.

792
01:11:21,268 --> 01:11:22,565
Sugar tongs.

793
01:11:24,037 --> 01:11:26,267
An old pair of boots...

794
01:11:27,073 --> 01:11:28,665
...in need of repair.

795
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:38,976
One pound, one shilling, and...

796
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:41,381
...eight pence, Mrs. Dilber.

797
01:11:41,621 --> 01:11:44,249
One pound, one shilling and eight pence?

798
01:11:44,324 --> 01:11:48,351
l always give too much to ladies.
lt's a weakness of mine.

799
01:11:48,862 --> 01:11:52,320
lf you ask for one more penny,
l'll repent and knock off five shillings!

800
01:11:52,799 --> 01:11:54,426
Open my bundle, Joe.

801
01:11:55,702 --> 01:11:58,102
What are we doing in this place, Spirit?

802
01:12:00,307 --> 01:12:01,365
Bed curtains.

803
01:12:01,975 --> 01:12:03,670
Bed curtains.

804
01:12:04,044 --> 01:12:06,706
You took them down
with him lying there cold?

805
01:12:07,714 --> 01:12:10,683
God in heaven, the rings are still on 'em.

806
01:12:11,151 --> 01:12:13,449
l did it. And why not?

807
01:12:14,187 --> 01:12:17,156
You were born to make a fortune,
Mrs. Riggs.

808
01:12:17,657 --> 01:12:22,094
l don't hold my hand back when
l can get something in it by reaching out.

809
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:26,590
Are they his blankets, Mrs. Riggs?

810
01:12:26,733 --> 01:12:31,295
Who else's? He isn't likely to catch a cold
without them, l daresay.

811
01:12:31,604 --> 01:12:33,800
l hope he didn't die of anything catching.

812
01:12:33,874 --> 01:12:37,310
Don't be afraid of that.
l wasn't so fond of his company...

813
01:12:37,378 --> 01:12:40,438
...that l'd loiter about him
for anything like that, if he did.

814
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:44,379
Look at that shirt, Joe.

815
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:49,487
Finest bit of silk you'll see
in a month of Sundays.

816
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:51,920
They would've wasted it if it wasn't for me.

817
01:12:52,126 --> 01:12:54,026
What do you mean, wasted it?

818
01:12:54,195 --> 01:12:56,595
Some fool put it on him to be buried in.

819
01:12:57,765 --> 01:12:59,323
l so took it off again.

820
01:12:59,467 --> 01:13:01,059
Calico's good enough for him.

821
01:13:26,494 --> 01:13:30,760
l understand
what you want me to do, Spirit.

822
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:46,577
l would do it if l could...

823
01:13:48,649 --> 01:13:50,913
...l have not the power, Spirit.

824
01:13:51,652 --> 01:13:53,176
l have not the power.

825
01:13:57,792 --> 01:13:59,191
lsn't there anyone...

826
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:03,121
...who feels emotion at this man's death?

827
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:17,605
-ls it good or bad?
-Bad.

828
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:20,406
We are ruined then.

829
01:14:20,648 --> 01:14:22,013
There's still hope, Caroline.

830
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,779
lf he relents, there is.
But that would be a miracle.

831
01:14:25,186 --> 01:14:26,710
He is past relenting.

832
01:14:27,888 --> 01:14:28,786
He's dead.

833
01:14:29,123 --> 01:14:31,091
To whom will our debt be transferred?

834
01:14:31,325 --> 01:14:33,520
l don't know. But, it'll take time.

835
01:14:33,961 --> 01:14:36,361
By then, we will be ready with the money.

836
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,504
l never thought death could bring
so much happiness.

837
01:14:47,641 --> 01:14:49,632
No, no.

838
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:55,344
Show me some tenderness
connected with the death.

839
01:15:03,023 --> 01:15:05,651
The cemetery. You went today?

840
01:15:06,327 --> 01:15:07,555
Yes, my dear.

841
01:15:07,895 --> 01:15:09,556
l wish you could've been there.

842
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,497
lt would've done you good
to see how green a place it is.

843
01:15:12,766 --> 01:15:14,256
Still, you'll see it often.

844
01:15:15,069 --> 01:15:17,560
l promised him that l would walk there
on a Sunday.

845
01:15:18,672 --> 01:15:21,300
My little, little child.

846
01:15:24,745 --> 01:15:26,076
My little child.

847
01:15:52,807 --> 01:15:55,071
There, Tim. There, Tim.

848
01:15:56,811 --> 01:15:57,937
Don't be afraid.

849
01:16:01,149 --> 01:16:02,639
We will always love you.

850
01:16:03,552 --> 01:16:04,450
Always.

851
01:16:22,871 --> 01:16:25,567
l met Mr. Scrooge's nephew, Fred,
on the street today.

852
01:16:26,608 --> 01:16:30,009
He saw that l was a little down
and asked what was the matter.

853
01:16:30,912 --> 01:16:34,211
l told him about our boy, Tim,
and you know what he said?

854
01:16:34,316 --> 01:16:35,749
What did he say, dear?

855
01:16:36,184 --> 01:16:41,281
''l am heartily sorry for it, Mr. Cratchit,
and heartily sorry for your good wife.''

856
01:16:42,991 --> 01:16:45,152
By the bye, how he knew that,
l don't know.

857
01:16:45,227 --> 01:16:46,489
Knew what dear?

858
01:16:46,928 --> 01:16:48,418
That you were a good wife.

859
01:16:48,496 --> 01:16:50,020
Everybody knows that.

860
01:16:50,599 --> 01:16:51,793
Well said, my boy.

861
01:16:52,801 --> 01:16:55,565
Anyway, young Fred gives me his card
and says:

862
01:16:55,637 --> 01:16:57,935
''That's where l live, Bob.
Come and visit us.''

863
01:16:58,406 --> 01:17:01,637
l was grateful,
not for anything he might do for us...

864
01:17:01,977 --> 01:17:03,604
...so much as his kindly ways.

865
01:17:04,379 --> 01:17:08,145
lt really seemed as if he's known our Tim
and felt for us.

866
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:10,515
He sounds a good soul.

867
01:17:10,919 --> 01:17:13,114
You'd be sure of it if you met him, Mother.

868
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:16,346
l'm sure we'll never forget our Tim,
will we?

869
01:17:16,658 --> 01:17:18,717
Never, Father.

870
01:17:18,793 --> 01:17:21,887
And l know that when we remember
how brave and patient he was...

871
01:17:21,963 --> 01:17:23,760
...although he was only small...

872
01:17:23,832 --> 01:17:26,266
...we'll never quarrel
amongst ourselves again...

873
01:17:26,334 --> 01:17:28,131
...and forget our Tim in doing it.

874
01:17:28,336 --> 01:17:30,099
Of course we won't, my dear.

875
01:17:37,445 --> 01:17:38,469
l'm very happy.

876
01:17:40,148 --> 01:17:41,308
Very happy.

877
01:18:06,007 --> 01:18:08,908
Spirit, answer me one question.

878
01:18:11,112 --> 01:18:14,013
Are these the shadows of things
that will be...

879
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:18,778
...or the shadows of things
that may be, only?

880
01:18:23,758 --> 01:18:27,956
Men's actions determine certain ends
if they persist in them.

881
01:18:29,097 --> 01:18:32,931
But if their actions change,
the ends change too.

882
01:18:35,236 --> 01:18:37,797
Say it is so with what you show me.

883
01:18:56,726 --> 01:18:57,715
Am l...

884
01:18:59,628 --> 01:19:01,721
...the man that lay upon that bed?

885
01:19:05,801 --> 01:19:09,202
Oh, no, Spirit! Spirit, no, no!

886
01:19:10,306 --> 01:19:11,773
Spirit, hear me.

887
01:19:12,742 --> 01:19:14,107
l'm not...

888
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:16,537
...the man l was.

889
01:19:18,414 --> 01:19:20,882
Why show me this if l am past all hope?

890
01:19:24,053 --> 01:19:27,284
Good spirit, pity me.

891
01:19:30,059 --> 01:19:34,553
l will know Christmas in my heart,
and keep it all the year.

892
01:19:35,931 --> 01:19:39,367
The Spirits of all three Christmases
shall thrive in me.

893
01:19:39,568 --> 01:19:42,469
l will not shut out the lessons
that they teach.

894
01:19:43,706 --> 01:19:47,301
Oh, let me wash away
the writing on this stone!

895
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:36,118
My room.

896
01:20:39,662 --> 01:20:40,651
My bed.

897
01:20:42,898 --> 01:20:44,331
Jacob, Heaven...

898
01:20:45,234 --> 01:20:47,293
...and Christmas time be praised.

899
01:20:48,804 --> 01:20:50,066
Still here.

900
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:54,207
They are not torn down. Rings and all.
They're here!

901
01:21:00,749 --> 01:21:01,738
l'm here.

902
01:21:03,953 --> 01:21:06,581
The shadows of the things
that would have been...

903
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:09,951
...can be dispelled.

904
01:21:11,026 --> 01:21:12,425
They will be.

905
01:21:13,062 --> 01:21:14,825
l know they will!

906
01:21:44,461 --> 01:21:47,453
l don't know what day it is.

907
01:21:48,832 --> 01:21:53,030
l don't know how long
l've been among the Spirits.

908
01:21:53,937 --> 01:21:56,337
l don't know anything.

909
01:22:08,084 --> 01:22:11,053
No fog. No mist.

910
01:22:11,888 --> 01:22:16,450
Clear, bright, cold.

911
01:22:18,228 --> 01:22:22,289
Cold, piping for the blood to dance to.

912
01:22:26,369 --> 01:22:28,132
Hello! What's today?

913
01:22:29,105 --> 01:22:29,833
Eh?

914
01:22:29,906 --> 01:22:33,034
What's today, my fine fellow?

915
01:22:33,443 --> 01:22:35,638
Today? Why, it's Christmas Day.

916
01:22:35,845 --> 01:22:37,312
lt's Christmas Day.

917
01:22:38,815 --> 01:22:40,476
l haven't missed it.

918
01:22:41,551 --> 01:22:44,019
The Spirits have done it all in one night.

919
01:22:44,554 --> 01:22:47,114
They can do anything they like.
Of course, they can.

920
01:22:49,292 --> 01:22:51,419
Hello, my fine fellow.

921
01:22:51,494 --> 01:22:52,461
Hello.

922
01:22:52,796 --> 01:22:55,162
Do you know the Poulterers
in the next street?

923
01:22:55,732 --> 01:22:56,892
Of course l do.

924
01:22:56,967 --> 01:23:00,368
Have they sold the prize turkey
hanging in the window? The big one.

925
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:01,998
The one as big as me?

926
01:23:02,339 --> 01:23:04,933
That's it. Delightful boy.

927
01:23:05,408 --> 01:23:06,773
Yes, it's still there.

928
01:23:06,843 --> 01:23:07,935
Good. Go buy it.

929
01:23:08,411 --> 01:23:09,469
You're jossing.

930
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:11,237
No. Go buy it. ln my name.

931
01:23:11,548 --> 01:23:14,540
Tell them to bring it straight here.
Come back with the man...

932
01:23:14,751 --> 01:23:17,515
...and l'll give you a shilling.

933
01:23:18,855 --> 01:23:21,085
Come back in five minutes,
l'll give you two.

934
01:23:25,729 --> 01:23:27,629
l'll send it to Bob Cratchit.

935
01:23:28,832 --> 01:23:31,460
He won't know who's it from.

936
01:23:46,616 --> 01:23:50,143
Here's the man and here's the turkey.
Now, where's my two shillings?

937
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:52,984
Now that's a turkey.

938
01:23:53,456 --> 01:23:57,893
And here are your two shillings, my boy.

939
01:24:02,165 --> 01:24:05,794
l want you to take this bird
to Bob Cratchit.

940
01:24:06,636 --> 01:24:09,298
24 Camden Road, Camden Town.

941
01:24:11,041 --> 01:24:12,303
24 Camden Road?

942
01:24:12,642 --> 01:24:13,631
No, wait.

943
01:24:15,045 --> 01:24:17,479
You can't carry that bird...

944
01:24:17,647 --> 01:24:20,275
...all the way to Camden Town.

945
01:24:20,483 --> 01:24:22,713
You must take a cab.

946
01:24:23,186 --> 01:24:24,153
Yes, sir.

947
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:25,551
Keep the change.

948
01:24:26,056 --> 01:24:28,718
And don't tell Cratchit where it came from.

949
01:24:30,193 --> 01:24:32,491
A cab, sir. A cab.

950
01:24:36,099 --> 01:24:38,329
Good morning, gentlemen.
How good to see you.

951
01:24:38,401 --> 01:24:41,132
Good morning, madam. Sir! Beautiful day.

952
01:24:41,205 --> 01:24:43,696
Good morning, my dear.
What a lovely day.

953
01:24:49,113 --> 01:24:51,308
Fine snowman, fine snowman.

954
01:24:59,223 --> 01:25:00,190
Got you.

955
01:25:00,257 --> 01:25:03,420
''God rest you merry gentlemen

956
01:25:03,694 --> 01:25:09,098

He's in the dining room with his guests.

986
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:54,062
Will you have me, Fred?

987
01:27:56,134 --> 01:27:57,396
Bless my soul.

988
01:28:00,071 --> 01:28:02,869
Have you? Of course, we'll have you.

989
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,074
Any you, my dear....

990
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:15,517
Can you forgive a stupid old man...

991
01:28:16,288 --> 01:28:19,348
...who doesn't want to be left out
in the cold anymore?

992
01:28:20,926 --> 01:28:22,416
Will you take me in?

993
01:28:29,701 --> 01:28:31,032
Merry Christmas, Uncle.

994
01:28:35,874 --> 01:28:38,365
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

995
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,046
Mr. Cratchit, a word with you.

996
01:30:04,129 --> 01:30:06,723
What do you mean by coming here
at this time of day?

997
01:30:07,866 --> 01:30:10,426
l'm very sorry, sir. l'm behind my time.

998
01:30:10,869 --> 01:30:12,461
Oh, yes, you are.

999
01:30:13,238 --> 01:30:15,035
lndeed, you are.

1000
01:30:16,207 --> 01:30:19,142
lt's only once a year, sir.
lt's only once a year.

1001
01:30:19,210 --> 01:30:21,644
l was making rather merry yesterday, sir.

1002
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:26,576
l'll tell you what, my friend. l'm not going
to put up with this any longer.

1003
01:30:27,385 --> 01:30:29,216
And therefore...

1004
01:30:30,422 --> 01:30:32,287
...and therefore...

1005
01:30:34,726 --> 01:30:36,956
...l'm going to raise your salary.

1006
01:30:39,097 --> 01:30:41,224
Merry Christmas, Bob!

1007
01:30:46,472 --> 01:30:49,407
A Merrier Christmas than l've wished you...

1008
01:30:49,508 --> 01:30:50,998
...in many a year.

1009
01:30:52,745 --> 01:30:54,975
l'd like to help your family...

1010
01:30:55,548 --> 01:30:56,742
...if you'd let me.

1011
01:30:56,816 --> 01:31:00,980
l will raise your salary and we will discuss
your affairs this afternoon...

1012
01:31:01,554 --> 01:31:04,421
...over a Christmas bowl
of smoking Bishop.

1013
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:09,225
Make up the fires...

1014
01:31:10,729 --> 01:31:13,425
...and before you dot another ''i'',
Bob Cratchit...

1015
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:15,990
...buy another coal scuttle.

1016
01:31:27,113 --> 01:31:31,550
My uncle was better than his word.
He did it all and infinitely more.

1017
01:31:32,118 --> 01:31:36,384
And to tiny Tim, who did not die,
he was a second father.

1018
01:31:37,456 --> 01:31:41,620
He became as good a friend,
as good a master and as good a man...

1019
01:31:41,694 --> 01:31:43,559
...as the good old city knew...

1020
01:31:43,629 --> 01:31:48,032
...or any other good old city, town,
or borough, in the good old world.

1021
01:31:49,969 --> 01:31:52,529
Some people laughed
to see the alteration in him...

1022
01:31:52,605 --> 01:31:55,631
...but he let them laugh
and little heeded them.

1023
01:31:55,741 --> 01:31:59,438
His own heart laughed
and that was quite enough for him.

1024
01:31:59,812 --> 01:32:00,938
Come along, Tim.

1025
01:32:01,013 --> 01:32:02,571
It was always said of Scrooge...

1026
01:32:02,648 --> 01:32:05,242
...that he knew how to keep
Christmas well...

1027
01:32:05,651 --> 01:32:08,176
...if any man alive
possessed the knowledge.

1028
01:32:08,554 --> 01:32:11,990
May that be truly said of us, and all of us.

1029
01:32:13,092 --> 01:32:15,458
And so, as Tiny Tim observed:

1030
01:32:15,661 --> 01:32:17,561
God bless us, every one!
