just like Thomas and me.

344
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,917
W... Was it just,
like, all of you

345
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:18,586
in one big, like...

346
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:20,988
blob or...

347
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,791
(BOTH LAUGHING)

348
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,224
I want details.

349
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,060
(GULPS) I need another
sip. (BOTH LAUGHING)

350
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:32,132
So you and Kyle are on the bed.

351
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,869
And where are Thomas and
Katie during all this?

352
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,672
Uh, on the chair in
the corner. Mm-hmm.

353
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,174
That little blue one?

354
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:41,407
Okay.

355
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:44,144
And so, she's, like,
sitting in Thomas's lap...

356
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,412
Mm-hmm. Her back to me

357
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:48,115
clothes still on,
mind you. Mm-hmm.

358
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:53,353
And Thomas, you know,
starts kissing her neck,

359
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:56,457
and then looks over
her shoulder at me,

360
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:58,660
and it just felt like,

361
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,296
"This is it. Let's... let's go."

362
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,264
(BOTH LAUGHING)

363
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,868
BEN: I'm not opposed
to it in theory.

364
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,304
It's more... in practice
I'm not so sure about.

365
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:11,437
THOMAS: Uh-huh.

366
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,241
You do know you still have
fun when you have kids, right?

367
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:15,242
(SCOFFS)

368
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,779
It's just slightly
different fun.

369
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:21,482
I like kids. We both
like kids. It's just...

370
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,719
It's kind of like the
high-end Airbnb, you know?

371
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:27,120
It's great for the
weekend, just...

372
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:29,490
not so sure it's
really our lifestyle.

373
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:31,793
Yeah, you'd be surprised how
your lifestyle can change.

374
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:33,093
Is it hard?

375
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:36,497
Sometimes, sure, but
it's the best thing, man.

376
00:16:36,598 --> 00:16:37,765
Mm.

377
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,235
Sometimes it feels like
it's the only thing.

378
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:48,041
So things... progress
between Kyle and me.

379
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:51,613
Okay, like, you took
your clothes off or...

380
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:53,113
Mm-hmm.

381
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,619
Ellie. Did you guys actually...

382
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:58,786
Oh, we fucked.

(INHALES) And?

386
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,428
(CUP THUDS ON TABLE)
And it was great.

387
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,231
Until I look over
at Thomas and Katie,

388
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:14,536
and they're just
watching us, sort of...

389
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:18,540
I don't know, like,
half-heartedly canoodling.

390
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,072
Canoodling?

391
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:23,443
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it
was weird, Margo.

392
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,813
But did you finish?

393
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:30,183
So, I told Thomas
that I faked it.

394
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,521
Off the fucking charts.

395
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:35,924
(LAUGHS) Okay, Kyle.

396
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:37,992
Yes. (BOTH LAUGHING)

397
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:42,162
(INHALES) And so it's
been weird ever since.

398
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:44,832
Mm-hmm. I mean,
you saw. I just...

399
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,403
I don't know. I... I feel like
I cheated on him or something.

400
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,973
He'll get over it. Mm.

401
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,341
Like, he hasn't
touched me since.

402
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:57,745
To be fair, you know, it's just
been busy with work... Hmm.

403
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:59,814
And the kids and my parents.

404
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:02,449
We haven't really had
any time to ourselves.

405
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:07,087
Well, why don't the kids
just stay here tonight?

406
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:09,456
Could they?

407
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,458
I mean, I don't see why not.

408
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,160

to kind of like

409
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,538
having them around.

to be responsible adults,
