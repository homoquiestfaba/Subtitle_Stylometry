1
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,400
<i>"Information"...</i>

2
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,200
<i>the very nature of the word</i>
<i>is beginning to change.</i>

3
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,400
<i>The world is shrinking.</i>

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,800
Borders are collapsing...

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200
cultures are growing closer and closer
day by day.

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,000
Information is the new unexplored frontier.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,400
And in the forefront of this new age is,
of course...

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,000
the Internet.

9
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,000
Are you sure this is a big story?

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,200
"Scoop," Joaquim. The proper term
is scoop. And, yeah, I'm sure.

11
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,000
Cute secretaries don't lie. Well...

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,800
Hank, you're my hero.

13
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,400
-Hey, where are you going?
-Press.

14
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,800
Do you have an appointment?

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,600
There's a coup going on in that boardroom.
That's news.

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,200
You need an appointment to get in.

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,800
7tv, Hank Robinson, right there.

18
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Okay, rock and roll.

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,800
-Public broadcasting?
-Is that a problem?

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,800
Take it easy, Hank.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,200
No, take it easy?
I'm not going to take it easy.

22
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,200
I don't need this guy
keeping me out of here...

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,600
because he doesn't like
the company I'm working for.

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
How come he waltzes through?

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,600
<i>Señor</i> Aribau has the exclusive rights
to all Nova communications.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,800
The number of people who get their news
from the Internet...

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,800
as opposed to, you know,
TV or newspapers...

28
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,200
grows by 1 million worldwide each year.

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
One million.

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,400
Just follow my lead, and it'll be fine, okay?

31
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,400
Good morning, Christina,
you look beautiful. Can I see the boss?

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,800
Just a minute, please.

33
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
The conclusion is obvious.

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,000
He who controls the Internet...

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
controls information.

36
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,800
In the last three years,
Nova communications...

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
have carved a widening niche
in the telecommunications market.

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, I believe it's time we expanded.

39
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,000
Did you call the press, <i>Señor</i> Pla?

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,000
No, I did not.

41
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,400
If you think something newsworthy
is going to happen today...

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
you are very much mistaken.

43
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,600
You may be our main stockholder,
but I'm still president of this company.

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,200
I direct policy. Nothing will change that.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
Hank Robinson reporting from Barcelona.

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,800
I am standing in front
of the headquarters of Nova...

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,800
the fastest growing
telecommunications company in Spain.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,600
Today, majority shareholder Manuel Pla
is challenging Nova president Sert...

49
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,800
inside the boardroom,
while I stand out here in the parking lot.

50
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,800
Come on, let's go again.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Take two.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,600
What's this?

53
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
This is my offer, <i>Señor</i> Sert.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Quite generous, I think.

55
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,800
You're trying to buy me out?

56
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
We get a two-shot
and we go to lunch, okay?

57
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Everybody down! On the floor. Now!

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,200
-Don't move!
-Oh, no!

59
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
What the hell is that?

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,200
What the hell is going on here?

61
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,400
-What's the meaning of this?
-Oh, my God!

62
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
Jesus Christ!

63
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Let's go.

64
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,200
-Go? Go where?
-In there, where the story is.

65
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,600
You know what else is in there?
Someone with a gun.

66
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
-Give me the camera.
-No!

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,200
Fine.

68
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,600
Nothing is worth dying for, man.

69
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,200
-Call the police, I'm going in.
-Hank.

70
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,600
-Who are you people?
-We are Anarchy Now.

71
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,400
Your company spreads lies
to confuse innocent people.

72
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,800
Gunfire at the Nova offices.

73
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,400
Always make sure there's film in the camera.

74
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,400
You support the capitalist pigs.
This is your reward.

75
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,400
All of you, get out of here! Come on, run!

76
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Run!

77
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,600
Tell everyone the truth.

78
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,400
Boss!

79
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,600
Listen, call Veronica.
Tell her I've got footage of Sert's murder.

80
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,800
<i>Acts of terror have become so commonplace</i>
<i>in our age...</i>

81
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
<i>that we run the risk</i>
<i>of becoming used to their images...</i>

82
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,800
<i>to becoming desensitised to them.</i>

83
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,400
<i>The day that these shocking, horrific images</i>
<i>fail to appal us...</i>

84
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,600
<i>is the day that we begin to lose</i>
<i>some of our humanity.</i>

85
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,200
<i>Let's let these images speak for themselves.</i>
<i>I, for one, will not soon forget them.</i>

86
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,200
-My favourite part's coming up.
<i>-This is Hank Robinson reporting...</i>

87
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
<i>with a 7tv news exclusive.</i>

88
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,800
And we're out.

89
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,600
Pure genius.

90
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,200
It helps to have
the hottest producer in town.

91
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,800
All the major wires called.
They want to licence your video.

92
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,400
-Bleed them dry.
-And our ratings are climbing.

93
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,200
We got 20 share tonight.
Thousands of people tuned in.

94
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,200
-How does it feel being a star?
-Twenty share?

95
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,000
Speaking as your producer, I'm thrilled.

96
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,000
Speaking as your girlfriend...

97
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,400
don't ever risk your life like that again.

98
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,600
With great risks come great rewards.

99
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,000
What you did was the most inspiring thing
I've ever seen.

100
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
Veronica.

101
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,400
That tape...

102
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,800
The thing is...

103
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,200
-I just--
-Proved to the world...

104
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,400
what I've always known.
You're the real deal, Hank.

105
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
I love you.

106
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,400
And I don't want to lose you.

107
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,400
I love you, too.

108
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,400
I have to rinse.

109
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,200
Yes, I understand all that,
but just get him for me.

110
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,400
At 3:00, you're interviewing
Cardinal Rosselli.

111
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,400
-I thought he never meets the press.
-He agreed to talk to you.

112
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,000
This is a real scoop.

113
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Ronnie. I'm getting audio interference
on Camera 2.

114
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,800
-Interference?
-Either God's talking to us...

115
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,200
<i>or it's someone's cell phone.</i>

116
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
His polls are rather low.

117
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,200
Excuse me, sir. Can't you see the sign?

118
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm most terribly sorry.
Very thoughtless of me.

119
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,200
Nicola, I'll have to call you back.

120
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,200
I'm Archibald McGovern.

121
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,600
And you are Veronica Nadal.

122
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,600
Top of your class of
the Barcelona School of Journalism. 1999?

123
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,400
'98, actually.

124
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm here to see Mr. Robinson.

125
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,600
So, this is 7tv. Well, it's quaint.

126
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,600
Is your studio fully soundproof?

127
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,000
Of course. Some of the equipment
has been here since the '60s.

128
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,800
That's all, it needs to be replaced.

129
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,600
A journalist of Mr. Robinson's stature
deserves better.

130
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
We are only a local station,
we take what we can get.

131
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,400
-Jordi, what the hell are you doing?
-Sorry, Miss Nadal.

132
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,800
You can start by replacing him.

133
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,000
Excuse me.

134
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,200
Hank Robinson? Archie McGovern, owner--

135
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,600
And CEO of Vision Television News.
Pleasure, sir. Pleasure to meet you.

136
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,400
I'm sorry, this will have to wait.
Hank goes on in 10 minutes.

137
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,800
Have you met Veronica, my producer?

138
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,800
Oh, yes, indeed. And I will only take five.

139
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,600
You have to forgive her.
She's a little protective.

140
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,000
And rightly so. You're her gold mine.

141
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,200
So that's McGovern. Seems like a nice guy.

142
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,600
Yeah, that's just what they said about Hitler.

143
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,000
-Okay. Let's get Hank's sound levels up.
<i>-WeII, we did start 7tv together.</i>

144
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,800
-Shall we?
<i>-It's kind of our baby.</i>

145
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
<i>Scrimping and scavenging for every cent...</i>

146
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,600
<i>hunting down stories,</i>
<i>hoping and praying for the exclusive...</i>

147
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,600
<i>that would put you on the map.</i>

148
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,600
Yes, I know that life. I know it very well.

149
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,600
So tell me, Hank,
how many viewers does 7tv get a week?

150
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
70,000? 100,000?

151
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
55,000, sir.

152
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,600
Vision TV...

153
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,200
is watched by 10 million people
every night, and growing.

154
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,600
<i>I know, sir. What can I do for you?</i>

155
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
Mr. Robinson, I'm here
on a rather serious matter.

156
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,000
The late Carlos Aribau.
Did you know that he worked for me?

157
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Yes, he was a wonderful reporter.
He'll be missed.

158
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,800
On the morning of the Nova attack,
I sent Carlos to interview <i>Señor</i> Sert...

159
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,800
and then, your story came to my attention.

160
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,000
Mr. Robinson, you represent...

161
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Well, Hank, you represent everything...

162
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,000
that Vision TV has come to stand for.

163
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,600
And I would like you to join our family.

164
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,200
I beg your pardon?

165
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,400
That's right, Hank,
your gravy train has come in.

166
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,400
I'm going to have to talk to someone
about that.

167
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,200
I understand. I'm sure she will realise
what a grand opportunity this is for you.

168
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,200
-Bring her along if you like.
-Thank you, sir.

169
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Of course he wants to hire you.

170
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,000
Guys like McGovern
are afraid of guys like you.

171
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,800
You report the story.
McGovern, he reports the official story.

172
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,400
-He gets us into 10 million households.
-Yeah, but at what price?

173
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,200
My father worked for 10 years
before the networks called...

174
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,800
and when they did, he jumped at it.

175
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,200
Hank, we are so close
to achieving everything we wanted.

176
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,200
-Don't throw away our independence.
-It's a good thing.

177
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,400
-This is a good thing.
-You made a decision like that without me?

178
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,000
-I'm your partner, I'm your girlfriend.
-They promised to hire you.

179
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,400
I already have everything I've ever wanted.
At least, I thought I did.

180
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,000
Veronica, please sit down.

181
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Women.

182
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,200
-Let me buy you a drink.
-No, I got to go.

183
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
I think you're doing the right thing.

184
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,600
Vision TV, man.

185
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,200
That's a big time.

186
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
-Yeah.
-Need a cameraman?

187
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,200
You know what? I'll bet they probably do.
I'll ask them, all right?

188
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,600
You do that.

189
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,800
-Hank.
-Yeah?

190
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,200
My camcorder...

191
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
the one you filmed your Nova story with.

192
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,200
It wasn't loaded.

193
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,000
Sure it was.

194
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,000
No, it wasn't. I number all my tapes.

195
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,800
It was empty.

196
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,400
What's your point?

197
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,600
None of my business how you got the story.
Just share the wealth, you know?

198
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,400
I'm a talented guy, and I'm shooting porn
to make ends meet.

199
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,000
It's a fucking crime.

200
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,600
Are you blackmailing me?

201
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,000
No, I would never do that.
We're friends, right?

202
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,600
-Yeah.
-Friends do friends favours.

203
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,800
-Sure they do.
-So, good karma.

204
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,000
-We understand each other.
-Oh, yeah.

205
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,200
-We understand each other.
-Terrific.

206
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll be seeing you, Hank.

207
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Hey, <i>hombre,</i> that's my beer.

208
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,200
Hey, Hank!

209
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,800
Here's to us. Partners forever!

210
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Okay.

211
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,400
I can't get this all done.

212
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
No, you're not listening to me.

213
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,400
<i>Birth of a Nation: The Founding of Iran</i>
by Howard Robinson.

214
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,400
Your father's book
was required reading in class.

215
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,800
Barcelona School of Journalism.

216
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,400
I'm Marisa Perez. I'm your assistant.

217
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,600
This is my first job.

218
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Hello, Marisa. It's okay.
It's my first time having an assistant.

219
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,400
Miss Markham is waiting for you
in the newsroom.

220
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,600
-Of course, Nicola Markham.
-Yeah, she's our news director.

221
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,200
All right, the Chinese plan to have a man
on the moon by the end of the year.

222
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,400
Right, if their entire population
stands on each other's shoulders.

223
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,800
-You're late.
-Sorry, I didn't realise there was a meeting.

224
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,600
News happens every day, Robinson,
and every day we report it.

225
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,800
That's why we are called a news service.

226
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Eduardo, the Chinese astronaut is yours,
a present from me.

227
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,000
And next, in Africa,
AIDS epidemic is at an all-time high.

228
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Katrina, you run with that.

229
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,400
And in local news, Barcelona is once again
in the Champion's League.

230
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Make it the lead story.

231
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,800
Okay, what are you waiting for? Impress me.

232
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,400
-Not so fast, Robinson.
-Call me Hank.

233
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Robinson, how the hell
did you end up in Spain?

234
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,800
I thought there were
more career opportunities in Europe.

235
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400
Meaning you couldn't cut it stateside.

236
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,200
If you want to last here,
you will follow instructions, <i>claro?</i>

237
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,000
<i>-Claro.</i>
-Good.

238
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
After assuming control of Nova...

239
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,800
Manuel Pla set his sights
on his main rival, Intertel.

240
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
If Pla succeeds in purchasing Intertel...

241
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,200
he will have a virtual monopoly
on the telecommunications market.

242
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,400
-First Spain, then Europe.
-Precisely.

243
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,400
I want you to interview Eloy Agustin,
the head of Intertel.

244
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Find out why he won't sell,
and what he intends to do about it.

245
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,000
-Questions?
-No, ma'am.

246
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Good.

247
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,600
I was in Tehran with your father
during the revolution.

248
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,600
You look a lot like him.

249
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,000
I hope I'm half the reporter he was.

250
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,000
Careful what you wish for.

251
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,200
<i>Señor</i> Agustin, you're dealing
with a hostile takeover bid from Nova.

252
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
How are you planning to deal
with the threat?

253
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,400
I have faith in the loyalty
of my stockholders.

254
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,000
They realise Nova is trying
to force everyone out of business.

255
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,400
That may be,
but we deal in a free market society.

256
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
Can you really fault them their success?

257
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,400
Think of a world in which one company
provided every service.

258
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,000
Without competition, there is no need
to maintain quality, or accountability.

259
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,400
Information should belong to everyone.
The Internet should be free.

260
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,800
Unregulated.

261
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,600
Thank you, sir.

262
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
This is Hank Robinson reporting
from Intertel.

263
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,400
We have the edit suite booked for noon...

264
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,600
so with any luck,
we should be done tomorrow afternoon.

265
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,800
-Are you enjoying your new job?
-I am, yes.

266
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,600
Your predecessor, Carlos Aribau,
was a friend of mine.

267
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,000
-Was he?
-Did you know him?

268
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,800
Our paths crossed briefly.
Listen, I'd love to chat, but I must run.

269
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,200
-Thank you.
-Of course. Good luck.

270
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,800
I hope this business doesn't victimise you
the way it did Carlos.

271
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,800
What do you mean?

272
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,800
You know what it's like...

273
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,200
trying to weed out the liars
from the honest men.

274
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,600
In the end, Carlos trusted no one.
Not even his best friends.

275
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,000
-Hello.
<i>-Did I wake you?</i>

276
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Who's this?

277
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,200
<i>You've got 45 minutes.</i>
<i>Time for a piss and a shower. Hurry up.</i>

278
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,600
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me your name.

279
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,800
<i>Nova, Hank.</i>
<i>The Anarchist attack, remember?</i>

280
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,400
<i>You didn't sit on your ass.</i>
<i>You went out there and got the story.</i>

281
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,600
What do you want?

282
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,000
<i>The Gothic Knights bar, Robinson.</i>
<i>45 minutes.</i>

283
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,800
<i>And, hey, make sure there's film</i>
<i>in the camera this time, okay?</i>

284
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,400
Nothing personal.

285
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,600
You've seen too much.

286
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,600
<i>Señor</i> Agustin...

287
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,400
wants you dead.

288
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,800
-Did you confront Agustin?
-Of course. He got uptight...

289
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
claimed his private life
was nobody's business.

290
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,600
Sounds like he doesn't know
this girl is a killer.

291
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
He knows. He's hiding it.

292
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,400
-Conjecture.
-It all fits.

293
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,000
Who's Agustin's biggest rival? Nova.
Who did the terrorists attack? Nova.

294
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,400
Who benefits? Agustin.

295
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,600
-Talk about aggressive business practices.
-It's still all conjecture. We operate on facts.

296
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,400
I saw her at Nova's office. I saw her face.

297
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,400
You're a reporter. Your word isn't proof.

298
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
You need corroboration.

299
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,600
Nicola may be a bit overzealous at times,
but she has a point.

300
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,000
-Yes.
-Looking forward to seeing it.

301
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,000
-You'll have to excuse me.
-Thank you for your time.

302
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Mr. Robinson? Manuel Pla.
I recognise you from TV.

303
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,600
-And the lovely...
-Marisa Perez. Marisa is my assistant.

304
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,400
-Pleasure.
-Congratulations.

305
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,800
Your company's fortunes
have really turned around.

306
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Well, in part thanks to Mr. Robinson.
He made us famous.

307
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,000
And if we succeed on acquiring Intertel...

308
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,800
-Enjoy yourselves.
-Thank you.

309
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Would you like a drink?

310
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,400
Sure. Scotch is great, thanks.

311
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
Hi.

312
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,200
How are things?

313
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,600
Fine. I mean, sure,
we're in a ratings slump right now...

314
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,200
but we'll turn it around.

315
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,000
I've met a few young reporters
with a lot of potential.

316
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,800
You look beautiful.

317
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,800
So, that's your date?

318
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,600
-Marisa? Yes, she's my intern.
-Is that what they call it now?

319
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,400
I miss you.

320
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
A lot.

321
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,200
Can we get together? Talk?

322
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,000
I've left some of my things at your place.

323
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,000
Well, come on by. Anytime.

324
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I've got a story to cover.

325
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,600
Hey, I know you. TV.

326
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,200
It must have been scary.

327
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,800
-What's that?
-Alone, filming the Anarchists.

328
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,600
They weren't just angry young kids
with cap guns.

329
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,600
Top-of-the-line Uzis,
classic commando assault.

330
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,800
I'd say they had training, financing, backing.

331
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,400
Someone developed Anarchists Now.

332
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,400
And that someone is running the show.

333
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

334
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,200
I'm a cop. Brechner, Interpol.

335
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,600
-On duty?
-Always, keeping an eye on things.

336
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,800
Don't want a repeat
of the Nova incident, do we?

337
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,600
Agent Brechner,
you mind if I ask you a few questions?

338
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,600
-You on duty?
-Always.

339
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,600
Why not?

340
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,000
You identified any of the anarchists?

341
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,600
We have our suspicions.
One of them is a woman.

342
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
-You know her name?
-Do you?

343
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,200
All right, I'll level with you: I have a story.

344
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,200
My bosses won't let me run it
until I get corroboration.

345
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,400
-If I show you a picture, can you confirm it?
-You can't name me.

346
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,000
Anonymous source.

347
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,400
What do you need?

348
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,000
Her name is Leila Krtolica.

349
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,400
Anarchy Now's aim is to create chaos...

350
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,600
to destabilise governments,
eventually create a new world order.

351
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,000
Businesses represent capitalism to them,
their most hated enemy.

352
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,200
Already this year they've claimed 28 victims.

353
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,400
Leila made Interpol's most-wanted in June.

354
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,000
-Now she's in Spain.
-But what's her connection to Agustin?

355
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Terrorists need funding.

356
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,600
It's hard to blow up bombs
on an empty stomach.

357
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,000
You tell me Eloy Agustin is a sponsor
of terrorism?

358
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,800
According to my Interpol source.
They've been watching him for years.

359
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,400
Looks like you've got
your corroboration, Nicola.

360
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,800
Okay, Robinson. Impress me.

361
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,400
<i>What is the connection between</i>
<i>Anarchy Now operative Leila Krtolica...</i>

362
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,800
<i>and EIoy Agustin of Intertel?</i>

363
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
<i>Recently, Krtolica assassinated</i>
<i>the President of Nova...</i>

364
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,800
<i>Agustin's greatest rival.</i>

365
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,600
<i>Coincidence?</i>

366
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,000
Señor <i>Agustin has denied any connection</i>
<i>with any terrorist group...</i>

367
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,400
<i>and maintains he is the victim of a frame-up.</i>

368
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,800
Cut.

369
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,800
-Thoughts?
-Not bad.

370
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,200
Careful. You don't want
to hurt yourself praising.

371
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,800
You did your job.
What do you want, a cookie?

372
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,800
We'll lead with it tonight. Happy?

373
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,400
Jesus, Veronica,
I thought you were looking for...

374
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,000
-So what are you doing here?
-I told you, I left some things behind.

375
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,800
You weren't home. I still have my key.

376
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,800
Which reminds me.

377
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,400
So long, Hank.

378
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,600
I'm sorry. I'm just...

379
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,000
Sorry, I'm a little high-strung lately.

380
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,600
I saw your report tonight.

381
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,400
-You watch Vision TV?
-Only when you're on.

382
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,400
-And?
-You did good. I'm happy for you.

383
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Thanks.

384
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,200
Careful, Hank.

385
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,800
<i>I am humbled by the trust I've been given</i>
<i>in being appointed Nova's new CEO.</i>

386
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,600
<i>I vow to lead Nova</i>
<i>and its new acquisitions...</i>

387
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,000
<i>with integrity and vision,</i>
<i>into a prosperous future.</i>

388
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,800
<i>In the furore following the allegations</i>
<i>surrounding Eloy Agustin last week...</i>

389
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
<i>Intertel stockholders voted unanimously</i>
<i>to sell their company to Manuel Pla.</i>

390
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,800
Señor <i>Agustin, meanwhile...</i>

391
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
<i>is under investigation</i>
<i>by the Chief Magistrate's office.</i>

392
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,600
<i>This is Hank Robinson with Vision TV</i>
<i>signing off.</i>

393
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,200
Didn't your father ever teach you
to keep your powder dry?

394
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,600
Your story on Agustin caused quite a stir.

395
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,400
I've had the Chief Magistrate
on the line all morning.

396
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,000
Just the result of good journalism,
I guess, sir.

397
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,800
Yes. Free publicity is priceless.

398
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,600
Actually, I was thinking more
about the social value.

399
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,400
We exposed killers.

400
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,400
Ever wonder what a limey like me
was doing in Spain?

401
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,000
I love it.

402
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,200
Still virgin territory, pure.
It's waiting to be developed.

403
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,400
The rest of Europe is so cynical.
It's too knowing.

404
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,600
And together we going to make this city
the centre for world news.

405
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,200
And I have faith in you.

406
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,200
We're onto something wonderful.

407
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,600
You can't learn to be a journalist
from a book.

408
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
Didn't they teach you anything at school?

409
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,600
Yes. We had a saying.

410
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,200
"Believe nothing of what you hear,
and half of what you see."

411
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,000
That's a good motto.

412
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,600
Hello?

413
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,200
Yes, he is. Hold, please.

414
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
You've got a call on Line 1.

415
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Thank you.

416
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Hello.

417
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
<i>Good morning, partner.</i>

418
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,800
<i>Caught your piece last night. Good job.</i>

419
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
You going to give me your name this time?

420
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,600
<i>Call me Crusader.</i>

421
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,600
Okay, Crusader...

422
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,400
how did you know that Agustin
was sponsoring terrorism?

423
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,400
<i>A magician never explains his tricks.</i>

424
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,800
Listen...

425
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,400
why me?

426
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,400
<i>You're a rising star, Hank. You could go far.</i>

427
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,600
<i>I look forward to working with you</i>
<i>for a very long time.</i>

428
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,400
Listen, how do I get a hold of you
if I need you?

429
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
You were handed the story
on a silver platter.

430
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,200
-What are you complaining about?
-I don't trust him, or like him.

431
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,400
You're beginning to sound
like Carlos Aribau.

432
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,600
He thought his sources
were cooking up stories.

433
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
What?

434
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,000
Okay, I know what this is about:
fear of success.

435
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
You're on the verge
of surpassing your father...

436
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,000
-and the thought of it scares you.
-Bullshit.

437
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,600
Just do your job!

438
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,000
Here, another early story by Carlos Aribau.

439
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,400
Anything interesting?

440
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
The usual. Local news,
some crimes, some human interests.

441
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,200
You're a walking encyclopaedia, Marisa.
Listen...

442
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,000
-how did Aribau make it big?
-I heard, out of nowhere, he got a lead.

443
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,000
Something really big.

444
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,800
Out of nowhere?

445
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,800
Aribau had a secret source.
He never revealed who it was.

446
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,600
Probably never knew.

447
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,600
After that big story that make him famous...

448
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,400
he was offered a job at Vision TV,
and the rest is history.

449
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,200
Yeah, what was it? That first big job?

450
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,400
Industrial espionage.

451
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:03,200
Some telecommunications companies has
been accused of violating antitrust laws.

452
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,000
Aribau would champion their cause
and prove their innocence.

453
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,400
I was in high school,
but I remember it was a big deal at the time.

454
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,000
Manuel Pla.

455
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,200
Manuel Pla would have been ruined,
but Aribau saved him.

456
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,000
The attack on Nova, Agustin's downfall.
Over and over...

457
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,800
Pla benefited.

458
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,400
<i>Señor</i> Agustin?

459
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,400
<i>Señor</i> Agustin, we need to talk.

460
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,600
This is my home.

461
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,800
For 20 years!
I founded this company, and you...

462
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,000
-You took it away!
-We were set up.

463
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,600
The both of us.
Now, how did you meet the girl?

464
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,400
She came up to me, at the conference.

465
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,200
She was interested!

466
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,400
You are a man.

467
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,800
A woman that beautiful is interested in you,
do you chase her away?

468
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,200
She said you wanted me dead.

469
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,400
And you believed it. You, the great reporter!

470
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,400
I made a mistake.

471
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,200
I've been in business for a very long time.
This isn't over yet.

472
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,000
Tell me what you know.

473
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,600
I asked my own questions,
hired my own investigators.

474
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,000
Leila is no anarchist. She's no terrorist.

475
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,000
She's a cold, methodical killer.

476
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,400
-She'll kill for you if the price is right.
-Are you telling me she's a mercenary?

477
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,000
The Americans have a term
for people like her.

478
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,600
They call them "security contractors."

479
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,200
-Who hired her? Manuel Pla?
-Pla?

480
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,200
-Only a fool. Others behind him.
-Tell me who, <i>Señor</i> Agustin. Tell me.

481
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,800
God, it's them. You brought them here!

482
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,000
<i>Señor</i> Agustin.

483
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,800
No!

484
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,000
You did all you could, Mr. Robinson.
You are a hero.

485
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
A hero would have saved him.

486
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,800
Two assailants, one male, one female.

487
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,600
Anything you can remember about them?

488
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:43,000
They had on, what do you call it?
The motorcycle mask.

489
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I'm sorry. One moment, please.

490
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,800
-Robinson.
<i>-Don't say another word.</i>

491
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,400
Are you all right?

492
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,800
<i>-Everything is fine.</i>
-Yeah, everything is fine.

493
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,200
<i>-It's an important call.</i>
-It's an important call.

494
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,400
Take your time.

495
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,200
Listen, you son of a bitch, I am onto you.
You set up Agustin.

496
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,800
<i>Don't be so melodramatic.</i>
<i>Take a deep breath, calm down.</i>

497
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,000
I am coming after you. Do you understand?

498
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,800
<i>I don't exist, Hank. I'm a whisper,</i>
<i>a breath on the other end of the line.</i>

499
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,600
You set up Agustin and you set me up.
You want me dead next?

500
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,400
<i>I do hope it doesn't come to that.</i>
<i>I'm enjoying our relationship.</i>

501
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,600
<i>I have many, many more stories to tell you.</i>

502
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,800
You can't manipulate me.
I'm not Carlos Aribau.

503
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,200
<i>No, you're worse.</i>

504
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,400
<i>Carlos never stepped on corpses</i>
<i>to get a story.</i>

505
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,600
-McGovern.
-Hank!

506
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,000
-Have you been in an accident?
-Listen to me. Agustin has been murdered.

507
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,000
He was strangled,
and left hanging like a piece of meat.

508
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,200
-Murdered?
-Yes.

509
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,200
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

510
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,600
-The police are calling it suicide.
-What?

511
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,400
They found a note in his home,
and there is an eyewitness.

512
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,400
What are you talking about?
That's insane. I saw it, I was there.

513
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,600
All right, Hank, I believe you...

514
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,200
but this is a news service.

515
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,000
You'll never get this past Nicola
without proof.

516
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,800
Markham.

517
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,400
What time did it happen?

518
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,200
Take it easy.

519
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,200
I got some bad news. It's about Agustin--

520
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,200
Feeling the unyielding hand of the law
closing in on him...

521
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,800
and filled with remorse
over his terrorist activity...

522
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,400
he lynched himself.

523
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,000
McGovern scooped you.

524
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,000
But...

525
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,400
how did he know?

526
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,400
Veronica?

527
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,000
<i>Okay, come on, everybody, run!</i>

528
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
<i>Give me the fucking gun!</i>

529
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,800
Veronica, hi, it's me.

530
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,800
Listen, can you meet me at the station?

531
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:25,000
So, Hank, how are they treating you
at Vision TV? Good?

532
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,800
-Can't complain.
-Do you get overtime? 'Cause we don't.

533
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,600
-Pedro.
-Did they give you an assistant?

534
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,200
-Yeah.
-Is she a babe?

535
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,400
Pedro, the tape.

536
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,400
Well, the tracking's screwed up.

537
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,400
-Was the camera damaged in any way?
-Well...

538
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,000
We could dump both picture and sound
on a computer...

539
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,400
and run a component program.

540
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,200
I've got just the thing for that.

541
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,800
The computer
would digitally adjust the tracking.

542
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,600
It could clean up over 90%
of your sound and image.

543
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,200
-How long is that going to take?
-A day.

544
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,400
Do it.

545
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Now, about your assistant?

546
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,600
Okay, Pedro. Thank you very much.

547
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,600
She's a slave master.
You're lucky you escaped when you did.

548
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,200
Let me see if I understand.
The Anarchy Now attack...

549
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,200
it was all a ploy to disguise Sert's murder.

550
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
They killed the president of Nova
so that Manuel Pla could take over...

551
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:38,400
and they framed Agustin
so Pla could control Intertel, right?

552
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,400
You were a witness. You saw everything.

553
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,600
-Why didn't you expose them?
-I didn't know what I had.

554
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,000
The first time I looked at the tape,
it looked like a bunch of static.

555
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,000
What do you mean, "the first time"?

556
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
You shot this, didn't you?

557
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,200
Whose tape is this?

558
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,600
Carlos Aribau's.

559
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,800
Veronica, come on!

560
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,000
You robbed a dead man.
Have you no shame?

561
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,200
The cops. They examined the tape.

562
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,200
-Why didn't they catch this?
-Because I gave them a dub.

563
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,800
-Okay? I kept the original. I hid it.
-They are going to crucify you.

564
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,200
-Why? Why did you do it?
-Because...

565
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,000
all my life...

566
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,200
I was living in my father's shadow.
All my life, I wanted to...

567
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,600
I just...

568
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,800
I just wanted to be the best,
I just wanted to please. It was there.

569
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,400
I saw it. It was in my hand, I just took it.

570
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,200
I just did it.

571
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,400
Okay? I just took it.

572
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,800
I'm not this guy.

573
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,800
I'm not.

574
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,400
Marisa.

575
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Good luck.

576
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,000
Mr. McGovern?

577
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,200
I bet you think you're quite the hotshot.

578
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,400
Is there a problem, sir?

579
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,600
You, Robinson, and your story.

580
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,600
Your story on Agustin put us
at the top of the ratings.

581
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,600
Congratulations.

582
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,400
I know someone who's going to be very
happy with his Christmas bonus this year.

583
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,600
-Wow. Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

584
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,000
You know, maybe as a follow-up,
you should do a story on Nova.

585
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:07,000
You know, how Manuel Pla saved
the company after the terrorist attack...

586
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,600
and turned its fortunes around.

587
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,400
Fair and balanced, of course.

588
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,400
-Of course.
-Good.

589
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,400
An Agent Brechner from Interpol
called three times this morning.

590
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,200
"The Great Game."

591
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,600
It's a term the British used
during World War I for espionage.

592
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,400
They used people as game pieces
and the world as a board.

593
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,800
A board game. Kind of like Monopoly.

594
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,200
Except in Monopoly,
the game pieces don't die.

595
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,000
-Listen, Agustin was murdered.
-I know.

596
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,000
There's a new player in the game.

597
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Leila's partner, Paul Wolf.

598
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,000
Six feet tall, German, very professional.

599
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,000
Listen, I've been getting calls,
anonymous tips.

600
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,000
I'm thinking this Wolf
may be using me somehow.

601
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,600
What?

602
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,800
As a patsy, to cover up his crimes.
I don't know.

603
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,200
Goddamn terrorists.

604
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,800
Now they've joined the media.

605
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,400
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

606
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,000
I'm a reporter. I was hoping for a scoop.

607
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,000
Don't be an idiot, Robinson.
These people will eat you for breakfast.

608
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,200
If they contact you again...

609
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,200
please, let me know. Day or night.

610
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,400
-Consider me...
-A friend?

611
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,400
I was going to say "ally."

612
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,000
Mr. Robinson?

613
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,600
I'm sorry. Miss Markham told me
to give this to you.

614
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:45,200
She wanted me to hand it to you directly.
She sounded very mysterious.

615
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,400
What is it?

616
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,400
The police report on Agustin's death.

617
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,800
Who's winning?

618
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,800
Would you get me another drink, please?

619
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,600
This is for VlPs only.
How did you get in here?

620
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:50,600
The security guard was female.
She was susceptible to my charm.

621
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,400
-Big fan, huh?
-He's going to foul.

622
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,200
Yeah.

623
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,400
This fax. One could draw
some startling conclusions.

624
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,000
-The forward centre is a star.
-The police reports Agustin's suicide...

625
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,200
-at five minutes to 1 1 :00 in the morning...
-You're ruining my game.

626
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,800
...after McGovern and I spoke.
McGovern knew about this.

627
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,200
Our boss is involved in this.

628
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,600
Agustin never stood a chance.

629
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,800
-I'm glad you're in this with me.
-No, you can count me out.

630
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,400
-These guys, they don't blush at much.
-You scared?

631
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,600
If you were going to sit it out,
why did you bait me?

632
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,200
You were hungry, out to get a name.
Here's a story, now go fetch it.

633
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,600
So, I get my head blown off,
and you sit behind your desk?

634
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,200
Hank, when you've seen what I've seen,
and you've lived what I've lived...

635
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:41,800
then you can judge me.

636
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
If I can help without exposing myself, I will.

637
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,400
But I don't intend on destroying myself
over this. It's not big enough.

638
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,400
See you at the water cooler, Nicola.

639
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,000
Hello, Mr. Robinson.

640
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,400
lmagine running into you here.

641
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,000
Relax. Perhaps we--

642
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,400
Yeah, but the only problem was
he didn't understand a word I was saying.

643
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,200
-Quite--
-So, what's the joke?

644
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,000
-Hank, good to see you.
-Nice to see you.

645
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,000
Tell us what our star reporter
has been up to.

646
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,200
What have I been up to?
Well, I was shot, chased, nearly killed.

647
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,200
All in a day's work, you know.
How about you?

648
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,200
Murder any competitors lately?

649
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,000
Hank, why don't I get you a drink?

650
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,200
Enjoy yourselves.

651
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,000
You've been reading
too many spy novels, Hank.

652
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,200
How did you know what was in Agustin's
police report before it was issued?

653
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,600
I have an amazingly good contact
in the Barcelona police force.

654
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,600
-Who?
-Hank!

655
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,400
A good reporter never reveals his sources.

656
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,400
-You're lying.
-Am I?

657
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,600
Truth is in the eye of the beholder.

658
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,200
There is only one absolute truth:

659
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:28,600
Truth is power.

660
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,400
The anarchist attack on Nova.

661
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,600
Orchestrated to remove an obstacle...

662
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,000
that stubborn old fool, Sert...

663
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,800
and put Manuel Pla in charge.

664
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,600
-Framing Agustin?
-Another obstacle removed.

665
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:54,200
Now, Pla has his finger in the Internet
and telecommunications pie.

666
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,600
Why are you doing this?

667
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,200
The Internet is dangerous.

668
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:04,800
It allows people to get information
they cannot be trusted with.

669
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,400
It must be controlled...

670
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,200
step by step.

671
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,400
Until, eventually, people like you
are running the whole show.

672
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:19,000
I'm wondering what the Chief Magistrate
is going to think about this.

673
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:23,200
Why don't we ask him?

674
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:27,600
He's one of my guests.
He's right down there, see?

675
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,800
I believe you've already made
his acquaintance.

676
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,800
Of course, we will have to tell him the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth...

677
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,600
including your pilfering of the Aribau story.

678
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,800
Oh, yes, I knew all along.

679
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,200
That's why I hired you.

680
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,800
Well, we're the same, you and I.

681
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,600
Unbound by petty moral concepts
of good and evil...

682
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,400
we see what has to be done, and we do it.

683
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,000
-Men like us rule the world.
-No.

684
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,800
Yes.

685
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:03,600
We are governed only by our desires.

686
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,600
Me, it's power.

687
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,400
For you, I'd say respect.

688
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:19,000
Look, the crime is not
stealing the story, son.

689
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,600
The crime is getting caught.

690
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,000
So, why don't we join the party?

691
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,800
There are some people
I'd really like you to meet.

692
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:38,800
They, too, have done what it takes.

693
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:25,600
Manuel Pla: Triumph over Adversity.

694
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,600
I'm a whore.

695
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,600
<i>-Mr. Robinson, you have a call on Line 1.</i>
-Thank you.

696
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,400
-Robinson.
<i>-It's me. We cleaned up the tracking.</i>

697
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,000
-God, Hank. It's horrible.
-All right. Play it.

698
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,000
<i>Stop it! It's enough!</i>

699
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,200
<i>What?</i>

700
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,800
<i>Did you have to make such a scene?</i>

701
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,600
<i>Aribau filmed the whole thing, right?</i>
<i>Nobody will suspect me.</i>

702
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,800
<i>He saw what we wanted him to see.</i>

703
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,800
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

704
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,000
These people are savages.
We have to broadcast this, Hank.

705
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:07,800
Oh, God. All right, don't do anything yet.
Just give me a little time, all right?

706
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Okay.

707
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,600
Important call?

708
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,600
Don't you knock?

709
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,000
So what's the plan?

710
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,800
The plan?

711
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,800
Well, I thought I'd finish my puff piece
on Manuel Pla...

712
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,600
go down to the local watering hole,
get shit-faced, and try and get laid.

713
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,000
Yesterday, you were going
to change the world.

714
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,000
-Well, I thought better that.
-So you're going to do nothing?

715
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,200
You're the one that wanted to leave it alone.

716
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,600
So it's people like you and me
that help McGovern get away with murder.

717
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,800
Listen to Hank, Jr.! You and your daddy
are cut from the same cloth.

718
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,400
-Let's leave my father out of it.
-No, I don't think so.

719
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,400
It must have been tough growing up
in the great man's shadow.

720
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,400
But let me cut him down to size for you.

721
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,000
You know his great book: Howard Robinson
covers the Islamic revolution...

722
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,400
that topples the Shah of Iran.

723
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,400
He backs it up with eyewitness accounts
of atrocities and mass murders.

724
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:03,600
Truth is, he spent most of his days
in the Tehran Hilton, shagging me.

725
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:07,800
Bullshit.

726
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,800
His stories were ripped off
from local Persian journalists...

727
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,400
most of whom, I might add,
did not survive the Ayatollah's purges.

728
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,400
No witness, no one to expose him.

729
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,600
What, nothing to say?

730
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:32,400
Hank, look on the bright side.
He would've been so proud of you.

731
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,600
No, with all due respect,
I think you're wrong.

732
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,400
No, you should lead with this,
then pick this up later.

733
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,400
-It is much stronger, believe me.
-Yes, okay.

734
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,600
Our report on <i>Señor</i> Pla.

735
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,000
-Fair and balanced, I hope.
-Just like you asked for.

736
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,400
Good lad.

737
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,000
You know, Nicola, I think our Hank
is beginning to tire of Barcelona.

738
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Perhaps we should find
a more interesting spot for him.

739
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:12,200
Baghdad, say, or Kabul?

740
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,400
-I'm so sorry, Archie.
-No, it's my fault. Really.

741
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,600
-I'm such a klutz!
-It's all right.

742
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,400
-No problem.
-Sorry.

743
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,800
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

744
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,400
You two need a coffee break.

745
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Now.

746
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,800
Just wanted to let you know
that we're going to do a story on you.

747
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,800
One I think you'll be rather pleased with.

748
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,600
Well, let me see.

749
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,000
"Computer genius...

750
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,800
<i>"and Internet pioneer."</i>

751
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,600
Wait.

752
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
<i>"Legendary entrepreneur."</i>

753
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,600
When we are finished, the whole world
will want to get into bed with you.

754
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,400
The sky is the limit.

755
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,400
Robinson is a good dog.
He'll fetch and do as he's told.

756
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,600
Besides, it would be rather unfortunate
to have to...

757
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,000
put down another journalist.

758
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,600
Nicola! My turn to run into you.

759
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,000
Any special plans tonight?

760
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Those are top secret.

761
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:51,600
-Is it Chanel you're wearing?
-Archie!

762
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,400
-Who's the lucky man?
-I'll never tell.

763
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:00,400
Do I know him?

764
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,400
You'll never get away with this, you know.

765
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,200
Dating fellow employees
is against company regulations.

766
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,800
Okay, I'll quit.

767
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,800
-Look, let me give you a ride.
-No, thanks, Archie.

768
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,800
-You're not going my way. Bye.
-Goodbye.

769
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,800
<i>I'm so sorry, Archie.</i>

770
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:51,000
Nicola, you sneaky little devil.

771
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,800
Nicola!

772
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,600
-I had the story in my hands.
-All right.

773
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,600
I loved your father.

774
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,200
I'll nail them to a wall. I swear to you.

775
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,400
What are you waiting for?

776
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,200
Impress me.

777
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,400
Brechner. Listen, they killed her, okay?

778
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,600
Nicola. They killed Nicola.

779
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:26,800
Meet me at 7tv, all right? We end this now.

780
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,800
Robinson!

781
01:20:56,600 --> 01:21:00,200
-Hank, what happened?
-Don't ask.

782
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,600
-Listen, is the tape set?
-Yes, we can broadcast...

783
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,600
-from the studio right now.
-Okay.

784
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Brechner.

785
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,600
Go round back.
Make sure the rats don't escape.

786
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,000
I'm calling the cops.

787
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,200
-Hello.
-Hey, how are you doing?

788
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,600
-Brechner.
-No, no, no.

789
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,200
Call me Crusader. Yeah, that's it.

790
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,000
-He's on his cell phone.
-Keep him talking.

791
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,200
If I can find his frequency,
we can broadcast it from the studio.

792
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:57,600
-Listen, maybe we can cut a deal. All right?
<i>-I'm afraid not, pal.</i>

793
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:02,000
<i>You're not working out as we had hoped.</i>
<i>Your resignation is required.</i>

794
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,600
<i>-I even convinced McGovern to recruit you.</i>
-I've got his frequency.

795
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,800
I followed you for a week
after the Nova incident.

796
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,600
You never showed
any sign of remorse, not once.

797
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,200
I said, "This is our guy!"

798
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,600
<i>I even cleaned up after you.</i>
<i>Remember Joaquim?</i>

799
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:29,000
A few drops of hydrochloric acid
in a glass of beer...

800
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,000
problem solved, if you know what I mean.

801
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,400
-Nicola?
-An injection. Straight to the aorta.

802
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,200
Melts away the protective cardiac tissue.

803
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:40,200
Looks just like a heart attack,
don't you think?

804
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,000
<i>Very clean.</i>

805
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,200
Hey, that's my set.

806
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:50,000
<i>Hank, I had help. You helped me.</i>

807
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,000
They are all dead because of you.

808
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:57,400
<i>You endangered their lives</i>
<i>just so you could get one step closer.</i>

809
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,600
<i>To what, Hank? The top?</i>

810
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,400
<i>Greed. So ugly, isn't it, Hank?</i>

811
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:11,800
<i>I may have done the deed,</i>
<i>but you sure made it easy.</i>

812
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,600
-Listen to me, you son of a bitch!
-Now, now, now, Hank!

813
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,400
You should be thanking me.

814
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:21,000
You're not dead. The only reason
you're still alive is because...

815
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,800
I've allowed you to.

816
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,000
-Why don't you go to hell?
<i>-Maybe I will.</i>

817
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:31,600
But after you, my friend.
And Hank, when you get there...

818
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,600
say hi to Carlos Aribau.

819
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:36,600
Hello.

820
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,200
I don't think so.

821
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,200
You know, this is the second time
I've had to hold a gun to your head.

822
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:07,600
You remember.

823
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,800
I think I've let you live long enough.

824
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,600
God damn it!

825
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,000
This is so sweet.

826
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:56,600
Interpol. Everything is all right.

827
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,400
What?

828
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,000
Good thing your friend Pedro
called the police...

829
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,200
when he saw your impromptu broadcast.

830
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,000
We've been tracking these two for months.

831
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,800
So he was using your identity as a cover,
and you've been...

832
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:18,000
-following me to get to him.
-Well, I'm sorry.

833
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,200
-Excuse me. I got to go.
-Yeah.

834
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,600
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. I've been better.

835
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:32,800
I'm sorry.

836
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,400
The tape will destroy Pla. It's finally over.

837
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,800
Not quite.

838
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,200
<i>Did you have to make such a scene?</i>

839
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:46,200
<i>Aribau filmed the whole thing, right?</i>
<i>Nobody will suspect me.</i>

840
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,400
<i>He saw what we wanted him to see.</i>

841
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:57,000
<i>The evidence of the released videotape</i>
<i>led to the immediate arrest of Manuel Pla.</i>

842
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:06,200
The damning video was shot by...

843
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,400
journalist Carlos Aribau and his cameraman.

844
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:12,600
I stole it.

845
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:15,400
I apologise to them...

846
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,600
and to you.

847
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,600
As journalists, we have all taken
a sacred oath...

848
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,400
to report nothing but the truth.

849
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:24,800
But sometimes...

850
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,200
in the mad race for glory and ratings...

851
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,600
we forget our promise.

852
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,000
It's then your duty to remind us...

853
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
to keep us vigilant, to keep us honest...

854
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:38,600
to keep us fair.

855
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,400
Because in the end...

856
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,600
you get the press you deserve.

857
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,800
This is Hank Robinson for Vision TV...

858
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,000
signing off.

859
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,400
What are you all staring at?
Get back to work!

860
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:11,800
What the hell do you think you've done?

861
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,400
By ruining me, you've only achieved
your own destruction, son.

862
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,800
I'm not your son,
I have a father, you piece of shit.

863
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,600
-Don't--
-Temper, McGovern.

864
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:22,200
You don't want us to add assault
to the other charges.

865
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:24,200
Not that it would make much difference.

866
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:29,600
-Take care, Mr. Robinson.
-Thank you.

867
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,200
Hey, Marisa.

868
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,000
That motto from your class. What was it?

869
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,200
"Believe nothing of what you hear
and only half of what you see."

870
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,000
Words to the wise.

871
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,200
That's for you.

872
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:02,600
Thank you.

873
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,600
-Mr. Robinson.
-Yeah?

874
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Can I get my old job back?

875
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,400
I'll think about it.
