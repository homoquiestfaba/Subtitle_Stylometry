1
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,912
Piece of shit.

2
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,465
Expecting company, Rollins?

3
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,733
That's your little lady friend
coming over for the night?

4
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,234
Huh?

5
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:26,460
Zip it, Jelly.

6
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:27,937
I ain't in the mood
for your shit tonight.

7
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,840
Well whoever they are,
I hope they brought snacks.

8
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:33,701
I'm hungry as a
motherfucker, man.

9
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,082
Deputy Rollins?

10
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:39,983
And you are?

11
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:40,874
Soaking wet.

12
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,141
Freezing.

13
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,945
Mind if I come in?

14
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,178
Yeah.

15
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,480
Thanks.

16
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,161
Henderson County?

17
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,163
Unfortunately.

18
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,801
It's a little drafty in
here, don't you think?

19
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,827
Sorry, I'm Deputy Adams.

20
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,439
Don't mean to drop
in on you like this,

21
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:06,109
but in the current state I
didn't have much of a choice.

22
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,177
You drove all the way
out here in this storm?

23
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,679
Yeah.

24
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,014
It was coming down in sheets
when I got off the bridge.

25
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,518
I could hardly see three
feet in front of me.

26
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:18,455
The roads are about to
flood, so I had to pull over.

27
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,513
Where are you headed?

28
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,357
Huntington.

29
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,025
Transporting a suspect.

30
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:22,860
Huntington.

31
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:24,384
Uh-huh.

32
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,353
That's five hours from here.

33
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,631
Yep.

34
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:28,566
Like I said, the roads
are starting to flood.

35
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,066
Got the suspect.

36
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,861
I figured what better place
to hole up than a county jail.

37
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,930
- For the night?
- Is that a problem?

38
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,077
No, no.

39
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,713
I'll call the sheriff
and square it all away.

40
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,506
Be my guest.

41
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:50,210
Good luck getting through
to anyone in this, though.

42
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,688
Look, I'm not trying
to cause any issues.

43
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:52,756
Just let me lock up my guy.

44
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,881
As soon as this storm clears,

45
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,584
I'll get out of your hair, yeah?

46
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,188
What kind of offender?

47
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,533
The violent kind.

48
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,757
And?

49
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:06,793
Murder.

50
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,339
Where's all your people?

51
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,232
It's just me on the weekends.

52
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,465
I'm new.

53
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,070
Just transferred from records.

54
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,616
So being the last man
on the totem pole,

55
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,785
it's just me and
Jelly for the weekend.

56
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,009
Who's Jelly?

57
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:35,055
God damn, Rollins, you
lucky son-of-a-gun, you.

58
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,066
Henderson County, huh?

59
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,092
I need to spend more
time down there.

60
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,138
That's enough, Jelly.

61
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,231
Is Jelly his real name?

62
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,433
No.

63
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,612
Why do you call him that?

64
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:51,238
Come on in
here and I'll show you.

65
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,273
He's in for indecent exposure.

66
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,084
The sheriff wanted to get him
in front of a judge today,

67
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,111
but the storm took
care of all that.

68
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,949
So he's with us for the weekend.

69
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:02,793
Lucky you.

70
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,060
Yeah.

71
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,687
He likes to wiggle
his, uh, you know.

72
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,455
Yeah.

73
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,634
- Yeah.
- I got that.

74
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:13,837
So my guy, you got another
cell block I can use?

75
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,304
What's wrong with this one?

76
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,930
Yeah, what's
wrong with this.

77
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,866
- Shut up.
- All right.

78
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:23,971
My guy don't play
well with others.

79
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,849
Well we've got the women's
block but there's issues

80
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:26,983
with the locks.

81
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:27,984
We'll put him in Block B.

82
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,208
How's that?

83
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,756
As long as nobody
fucks with him.

84
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,284
I don't think it
will be a problem.

85
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:38,127
All right.

86
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,653
I'll bring him in.

87
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:05,512
What the hell did
you say this guy is in for?

88
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,745
Murder.

89
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:08,948
What kind?

90
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,852
The triple kind.

91
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,085
Twice.

92
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,039
What the hell is this?

93
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,898
That's his property.

94
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:31,104
Well, I can lock it in the
cage for you, if you want.

95
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:36,043
Do you have anything
to eat around here?

96
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:57,674
Don't get your hopes up.

97
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,369
The damn thing just eats change.

98
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,803
Let me try.

99
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,609
This is the last of it.

100
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,724
You were saying?

101
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,603
How the hell did you do that?

102
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,763
A woman's touch.

103
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:34,467
Do you have anywhere where I
can rest my eyes for a bit?

104
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,103
Smart ass.

105
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,452
Psst.

106
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,685
Hey, man.

107
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,656
What did they get you for?

108
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,270
You know me, they got me for
rocking out with my cock out.

109
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,363
You know what I mean, huh?

110
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,066
Guess not.

111
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,982
How about that fine-ass lady
cop you came in here with, huh?

112
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,206
Man.

113
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,654
Rollins is a lucky dog,
I'll tell you that.

114
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,124
Spend the night with here, whew.

115
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:24,627
Did you try anything
freaky with her?

116
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,851
Anything?

117
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:27,988
Nothing?

118
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,632
Not even during the patdown?

119
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:32,860
Dude, that's like
the best opportunity.

120
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,328
I guess not.

121
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,677
Hey you know, that reminds me

122
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,838
of a friend I had over
in Granbury one time.

123
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:45,950
So get this.

124
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:47,383
He gets pulled over, right.

125
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,243
Apparently he fucks his
way out of the ticket.

126
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,748
I mean, if that's true, that
shit is pretty epic, huh?

127
00:11:56,383 --> 00:12:00,754
Well, he was known to
over-exaggerate things a little bit,

128
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,021
so,

129
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,560
you don't talk much, do you?

130
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,039
I get that.

131
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:10,908
Yeah.

132
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:12,541
Neither does Rollins.

133
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,435
I swear the guy's got
a stick up his ass.

134
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,381
Well either way I hope
you ate before you came

135
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,842
because apparently
the kitchen is closed.

136
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,888
Yeah, the cook went
home or some shit.

137
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:28,248
Everybody is freaked
out over the storm.

138
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,760
Man, I tell you what,

139
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:33,386
I'm so fucking hungry
I could eat my watch.

140
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,123
But that would be
time consuming.

141
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,092
Nothing?

142
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,896
Damn, man.

143
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,075
You got that wrapped up tight.

144
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,204
Just talking to
myself here, Jelly.

145
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,505
All alone.

146
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:59,055
Hey, man, you got any toilet
paper in there with you?

147
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,925
You know, the stuff that they
give you when you book in?

148
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,483
It's paper thin.

149
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,128
I mean mid-swipe your
finger breaks through,

150
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,087
goes right up your ass.

151
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,266
You know.

152
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,590
Nothing?

153
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,301
Not even a handkerchief?

154
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,525
Tissue?

155
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,329
It's kind of an emergency.

156
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,565
Extra pillowcase?

157
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:19,409
Come on, man.

158
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:20,800
Help me out here.

159
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,670
Oh shit.

160
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,928
Well it ain't the Ritz.

161
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,930
Well like I said,
everybody went home,

162
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,123
so we should be alone.

163
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,824
Welcome to paradise.

164
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,794
What's with
all the empty offices?

165
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,405
Layoffs.

166
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,806
The county is moving
all those departments

167
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,866
by the end of the month.

168
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,167
- Shit.
- Yeah.

169
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,805
Well this works.

170
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:02,151
I just need to get a
couple of hours of shuteye.

171
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:05,278
Wake me if anything happens.

172
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,980
What would happen?

173
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:09,993
On second thought,
maybe I should.

174
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:10,951
No, I
got it, I got it.

175
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,496
It's my cell, my responsibility.

176
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,455
Well he's my suspect.

177
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,727
So tell me about him.

178
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:32,205
You could write a fucking
movie about that guy.

179
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,318
Kids.

180
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:35,818
A woman in her 70s.

181
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,345
It makes no difference to him.

182
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,715
When I found him, he was
sleeping a dumpster, with nothing

183
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,152
on him but a knife and these.

184
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,121
Risperdal.

185
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,169
The same shit they give
psychopaths and serial killers

186
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:55,371
when they're trying to calm
them down for questioning.

187
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,064
I know what it is.

188
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:01,677
I cleaned out the
infirmary last spring.

189
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,403
He killed six people?

190
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,183
Yeah.

191
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:11,111
A bus driver, a family
of three and two others.

192
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,094
When we pulled him
out of the dumpster,

193
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:22,122
brought him in for questioning,
he confessed, to all of it.

194
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,191
- Just like that?
- Yep.

195
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,005
That's strange, right?

196
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,229
Yeah.

197
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,910
I was bringing him to
Huntington for his psych eval,

198
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,972
and that's when El Nino
happened, so here we are.

199
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,408
Is he a rancher?

200
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,622
I doubt it.

201
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:51,584
No ranchers I know have that
much time for killing sprees.

202
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,762
Like I said, he don't
play well with others,

203
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,398
so, I don't mind staying up.

204
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,466
No, I got it.

205
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,225
I'll take care of it.

206
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,604
I can handle it.

207
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,563
Jelly and I will
hold down the fort.

208
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:04,796
Jelly?

209
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,598
Yeah.

210
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,212
He's a good guy.

211
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,546
He just has an unhealthy
obsession with his pecker,

212
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,770
that's all.

213
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,005
Okay.

214
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:15,819
Hey, do you have
any paperwork I can file

215
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:17,486
for all this shit?

216
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,747
I ain't going out in this storm
to get you damn paperwork.

217
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,491
Besides I'll be out of you
hair before you have time

218
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,117
to file it.

219
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,961
Fair enough.

220
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,296
Hey, the infirmary?

221
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,522
They got any meds in there?

222
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,292
Just aspirin and mild sedatives.

223
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,525
Why?

224
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,939
I feel a cold coming on.

225
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:40,700
I'll see if I can get
you some dry clothes.

226
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,196
No way.

227
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,197
You got it to work?

228
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,421
Magic touch.

229
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,503
What do you want for it?

230
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,528
You gonna keep your
dick in your pants

231
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,230
while we got guests?

232
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,467
Fuck it.

233
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:15,179
Yeah, whatever you say, man.

234
00:17:15,203 --> 00:17:16,403
Come on.

235
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,214
- Okay.
- I love you, Rollins.

236
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:19,472
Yeah, I bet you do.

237
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,449
Don't say I didn't
do nothing for you.

238
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,009
- Love you.
- Yeah.

239
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,361
Did you really kill
all those people?

240
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,157
Hey!

241
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,758
I'm talking to you.

242
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,237
Silence is golden.

243
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,898
Hey, Rollins.

244
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,242
What?

245
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:56,545
I've got to
drop a deuce, man.

246
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:57,770
Tough shit.

247
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,283
I mean, it's
a real code brown

248
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,741
over here, you know?

249
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:05,278
It's a big thumper dumper
four emergency, bro.

250
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,349
Hurry every chance you get.

251
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,120
What the hell is it?

252
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,331
Can you hurry me out,
I've got to shit.

253
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,132
I've got to shit real bad.

254
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,659
What's wrong with the
toilet in your cell?

255
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:20,636
Oh nothing.

256
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,494
It's lovely.

257
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,795
Fine facilities.

258
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,073
There's just no toilet paper.

259
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,810
What am I supposed to
wipe my ass with, huh?

260
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,035
Sit tight.

261
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:30,646
- Where are you going?
- I'll get you some.

262
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,480
Hey!

263
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,683
Hey!

264
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:45,027
Get up!

265
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:46,251
Up!

266
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,219
Up!

267
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:49,865
Get up!

268
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:50,723
Hands against the wall!

269
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,659
Hands against the wall!

270
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:56,839
Don't move.

271
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,164
Stay there.

272
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,008
Stay right there.

273
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,976
Jesus fucking Christ.

274
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,200
Oh my God.

275
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,447
Get your fucking head
up against the wall.

276
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:05,349
Right there.

277
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:06,639
Don't you fucking move.

278
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:07,483
Hey.

279
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:08,385
Hey, Rollins.

280
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:10,686
Rollins, what's going on?

281
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,978
Don't move!

282
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:12,888
You've got
to talk to me, man.

283
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:13,557
Stay right there.

284
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:15,014
Don't move!

285
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:15,824
Getting a little
worried over here.

286
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:16,626
You stay right there.

287
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,851
You stay right there!

288
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,028
Hey, where are you going?

289
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,339
Where are you going, Rollins?

290
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:32,975
Rollins, don't leave me
in here with this guy.

291
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,199
Rollins.

292
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:06,742
What happened?

293
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:07,577
What happened?

294
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,868
Where have you been?

295
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,446
Where the hell is the
bathroom in this place?

296
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,414
The bathroom?

297
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:12,372
Come with me.

298
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,441
You need to see something.

299
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:18,844
Ohhhh.

300
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,987
How long has he been like that?

301
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:30,990
10, maybe 15 minutes.

302
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:37,272
Singing that damn song
the whole time, too.

303
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,496
Hey!

304
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,568
Hey, shut up with that.

305
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,813
What about the arm?

306
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:48,074
I told you, he's
putting holes in it.

307
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,220
Didn't you search him when
you took him into custody?

308
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,456
Huh?

309
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,247
Is that how they do it
in Henderson County?

310
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:57,259
What the fuck is it
with both of you all?

311
00:21:57,283 --> 00:21:58,761
I talk to him; He doesn't
say a god-damned thing.

312
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:01,296
I talk to you, you don't
say a fucking thing either.

313
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,990
I want to hear
some answers, now.

314
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,160
Just not here.

315
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,365
Whoaaa.

316
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,038
Shit, shit, shit.

317
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,852
I didn't think the smokes
where that big of a deal,

318
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:59,121
given the gravity
of the situation.

319
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,345
Situation?

320
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,060
The luck it took to
bring that motherfucker

321
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,754
in after three years on the run.

322
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:14,427
Two of my guys lost their
lives to that motherfucker.

323
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,139
I was sparing you
the details earlier,

324
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:21,000
but those other two that
he killed, they were cops.

325
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,312
Jesus.

326
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,549
I wasn't going to let
anyone bring him in.

327
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:29,008
And I was racing the
storm on top of all that,

328
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,043
and I just, I fucked up.

329
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,146
All right?

330
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,018
But it is what it is.

331
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:42,264
Don't tell me you never
cut corners trying

332
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:44,223
to get where you're at.

333
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,361
Okay.

334
00:23:49,395 --> 00:23:52,340
The Risperdal keeps
him stable, right?

335
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:55,077
Why don't we just
give it to him?

336
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,704
Keep him calm for the next few
hours till the storm passes

337
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,405
and you two can get
the fuck out of here.

338
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,916
- No way.
- Why not?

339
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,186
Because that lunatic is
somehow more dangerous

340
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,410
on that shit.

341
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:07,580
Trust me, I've seen it.

342
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,693
He's a fucking loose cannon.

343
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:15,297
He'd kill us all before
midnight given the chance.

344
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,965
You don't think I can hold
him another eight hours,

345
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,100
do you?

346
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:18,935
I didn't say that.

347
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,226
Yeah, you did.

348
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,070
Maybe not with your
mouth, but you did.

349
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,271
Huh?

350
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,440
That little comment
about cutting corners.

351
00:24:24,464 --> 00:24:26,132
All I'm saying,

352
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:30,770
is you don't know that slippery
motherfucker like I do.

353
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,008
Listen, I'm sorry.

354
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,655
All right?

355
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,949
I didn't plan on
bringing him here.

356
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,182
Shit happens.

357
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:49,665
But this is what you
signed up for, right?

358
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:53,092
Better than pushing
record cards all day.

359
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:58,998
Either you're a deputy or
you're just pretending to be.

360
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:03,836
You have to make that
fucking choice tonight.

361
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,191
Hey, look, uh,

362
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,159
hey, Mr. Marlborough Man.

363
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,705
You know, I know you've
had a busy day and all,

364
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:33,733
but your friend Jelly
over has got an emergency.

365
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:39,739
Is there any chance you can
roll me your toilet paper?

366
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:42,141
I'm begging you, man.

367
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,744
I'm in a lot of pain over here.

368
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,114
Oh, yes.

369
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,885
No, no, no, no, no.

370
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:30,989
Oh, got it.

371
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:33,836
Listen, my friend.

372
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,230
I don't care what Rollins
and pretty coplady say,

373
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,675
you're a saint.

374
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:40,900
You're a lifesaver.

375
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,078
I love you.

376
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:43,411
I owe you one, man.

377
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,370
I really do.

378
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,603
Whew.

379
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:56,915
Oh God, oh.

380
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:03,454
Whew.

381
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,894
So Russell, tell me
everything about him.

382
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:14,166
He wet the bed until he was 15.

383
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:18,446
That was the first sign
something wasn't right.

384
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,775
He spent his teen years
lighting things on fire.

385
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:26,145
Just any inanimate
object he could find.

386
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,794
It was just small
stuff at first,

387
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:35,187
but like any junkie,
the sensation fades.

388
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,357
Right?

389
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,637
He moved on to bigger stuff.

390
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,861
Animals.

391
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,498
He used to film it, too.

392
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,679
You can just about
guess the rest.

393
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:53,372
Impulsivity, a need for control,

394
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:57,543
sheer lack of guilt and remorse.

395
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:03,658
Plus his parents used to
just think he was special.

396
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,551
The shrink went for it.

397
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,833
It's crazy how something can
be right in front of your face

398
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:13,025
and you just don't see it.

399
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,229
Pisces?

400
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,266
What?

401
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:25,404
Well I read most serial killers,

402
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:29,041
they usually kind of
turn out to be Pisces.

403
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,011
Well, what are you?

404
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,557
Me?

405
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:36,781
I'm a Leo.

406
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,628
Shit.

407
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:41,864
It's okay, it's
just the breaker.

408
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:44,232
This building is
over 50 years old.

409
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:45,758
Backup will come on any minutes.

410
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:46,634
How do you know?

411
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:48,793
See?

412
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:50,662
But the cell doors?

413
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,574
They're on a different breaker.

414
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,266
It should be okay as
long as it stays on.

415
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,911
So you don't know for sure?

416
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:56,746
Shit.

417
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,437
Where are you going?

418
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,152
Oh.

419
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,377
You've got to be kidding me.

420
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:10,950
The day just keeps
getting better and better.

421
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:14,686
Hey, Rollins?

422
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,920
You out here?

423
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,292
This isn't funny, man.

424
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,029
Marlborough Guy?

425
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:27,232
Anybody?

426
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,270
What the fuck's happening?

427
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:19,677
Oh, fuck.

428
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,549
He's gone.

429
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,053
So's Jelly.

430
00:31:32,858 --> 00:31:34,058
Oh, man.

431
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:36,204
So the cell doors, they
were knocked offline

432
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,039
because of the storm.

433
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:38,206
What about the exits?

434
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,041
Windows?

435
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:40,265
Doors?

436
00:31:40,766 --> 00:31:42,501
Rollins, the exits?

437
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:44,536
Exit doors only
open with my key.

438
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,514
Storm or no storm.

439
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,183
No one gets out of
unless I say so.

440
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:50,209
All right, so he's
locked in with us.

441
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,920
Jesus, is that a good thing?

442
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:53,388
I sure as shit ain't
spending another three years

443
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,747
of my life tracking him down.

444
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:13,731
Shit.

445
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,469
God damn it.

446
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,116
What are we going to do?

447
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,285
The lines are down.

448
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,077
Can't call for backup.

449
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,289
You're sure he's
locked in here, right?

450
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:28,547
That's right.

451
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,394
He'll be looking to kill us.

452
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:34,862
Just for the fucking
inconvenience we've caused.

453
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,599
He won't be happy with just
one body under his belt.

454
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,591
And he'll be looking for these.

455
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:40,825
It's his fix.

456
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:43,705
So we stick together
at all times, right?

457
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:45,974
We can clear this building
room by room until we find him.

458
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:47,642
Then we'll lock him somewhere

459
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:49,668
where the locks
can't go offline.

460
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:52,004
Either that, or we kill him.

461
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:54,806
Kill him?

462
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,776
It's better than him killing us.

463
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,987
Yeah.

464
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:01,780
Fuck, does this
place have an armory?

465
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:20,932
I got this out of the squad car.

466
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,166
Oh, thanks.

467
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:28,072
So this is it?

468
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:29,851
This is all the
firepower you've got?

469
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,020
Yeah, we're a small county.

470
00:33:31,044 --> 00:33:32,687
We don't have any action here.

471
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:33,945
Okay, good.

472
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:37,325
At least we know he
don't have a gun.

473
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,160
Wait.

474
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:38,994
The hat.

475
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,219
The fucking knife.

476
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:41,429
Yeah, how do you think
he killed your friend

477
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:42,621
in Cell Block A?

478
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,766
He got in when the door
was knocked offline.

479
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,792
God damn it.

480
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,696
So, where do we start?

481
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,204
Lead the way.

482
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,203
Clear.

483
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,408
Clear.

484
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,649
Clear.

485
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:11,776
Are you clear?

486
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,314
Nothing.

487
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:15,406
It's clear.

488
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:20,846
Check that one right there.

489
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,319
Clear.

490
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,025
Clear.

491
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:43,868
Clear.

492
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,306
It's clear.

493
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:02,854
Clear.

494
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,090
It's locked.

495
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,743
The sheriff's
already cleared out.

496
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,269
Check it anyway.

497
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,439
It's clear.

498
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,243
Check it out.

499
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:37,381
Here we go.

500
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,107
It's just mice.

501
00:38:52,131 --> 00:38:53,641
It's just mice.

502
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:54,833
Fucking rats.

503
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,110
Oh shit, you scared me.

504
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,334
You scared me.

505
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,369
Me, too.

506
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,139
Get down!

507
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,117
Get down!

508
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:12,883
Fuck!

509
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,970
Are you all right?

510
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:23,872
Ah!

511
00:39:23,896 --> 00:39:25,673
The fucker just cut my neck.

512
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,065
You'll be fine.

513
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,434
Did he get away?

514
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,658
Yeah.

515
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:06,397
We need a way to
section this area off.

516
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,769
How the hell are we
going to do that?

517
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:13,639
Can you lock this corridor down?

518
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:17,576
By hand.

519
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:18,953
Okay, do it.

520
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,245
I'll cover you.

521
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:24,115
We'll keep him out of this wing.

522
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,833
Did you see that
handprint on the wall?

523
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,034
He's hit.

524
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:46,471
If we're lucky it
will set off a trail.

525
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,839
Follow the blood.

526
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:01,987
All right.

527
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,830
That's it.

528
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,054
Let's do it.

529
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,868
All right.

530
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,136
That takes care of the north
end and the women's block.

531
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,196
So he's not in any
of those two places.

532
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,540
I locked the cage.

533
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,877
He can't get back in
there without a key.

534
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,670
I'm going to try
the phones again.

535
00:42:51,703 --> 00:42:53,648
See if I can't get a line out.

536
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:56,918
You know it's useless, right?

537
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:59,110
Well excuse me for trying.

538
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:00,345
Better than being stuck here

539
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:02,914
with Russel Fucking
Scissorhands.

540
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:07,251
Nice.

541
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:17,271
I told you.

542
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:18,495
God damn it!

543
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,111
It's been hours since
it started raining.

544
00:43:24,135 --> 00:43:25,335
They don't call it

545
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,973
the storm of the
decade for nothing.

546
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:32,143
Where are we going to go now?

547
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,289
We just keep clearing
the building.

548
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:37,983
It's two against
one, we'll find him.

549
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:40,118
Some fucking first day.

550
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,287
Yeah.

551
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,990
You know I was about to call in.

552
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:50,137
Take the weekend
to think it over.

553
00:43:50,161 --> 00:43:51,930
Go to the stockyards.

554
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:54,976
Stockyards?

555
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,200
Yeah.

556
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,835
Cowboy camp.

557
00:44:00,438 --> 00:44:03,284
I used to sleep there on the
weekends when I was younger.

558
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,810
During the summer.

559
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,148
You were a cowboy?

560
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,682
Was.

561
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,794
Tell me why you became a cop.

562
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:23,637
What?

563
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,861
Why?

564
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,674
Just do it.

565
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:29,367
I think we have bigger
fucking problems here.

566
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:34,439
I mean of all the places to
go and start a life, why here?

567
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:39,310
Where am I going to go?

568
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,023
I was born in this town.

569
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:44,382
That's the way it is.

570
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:48,119
You start a life here,
it ends the same way.

571
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:54,125
My family's been doing
it for generations.

572
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,638
I figured being a deputy
was the best thing

573
00:44:57,662 --> 00:45:00,374
to do for the community.

574
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:05,236
A way to give back to something
that's given so much to me.

575
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:08,539
Given so much to you?

576
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:11,575
Like what?

577
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,881
You know, like what?

578
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:19,550
Help me understand
what you mean.

579
00:45:21,987 --> 00:45:25,690
You see right through
it, don't you, Adams?

580
00:45:28,227 --> 00:45:30,829
I stayed for my father, family.

581
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:38,545
Truth be told, I wanted
to be a team roper.

582
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,738
I wanted to travel.

583
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:42,607
I wanted to do anything
besides grow up

584
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:46,377
and live in a shithole town
like this the rest of my life.

585
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:49,747
But life finds a way
of getting in front

586
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:55,720
of the things you want
and makes you settle

587
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,755
for the things you need.

588
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:05,030
So what did your daddy think
about your new career choice?

589
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:07,398
Don't matter what he thinks.

590
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:08,632
He's dead.

591
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:16,241
But he'd have done anything
to keep me off of that rope.

592
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,376
Keep me off of the arena.

593
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:22,356
Living that life that he led.

594
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,750
But I fell for it,
hook, line and sinker.

595
00:46:28,253 --> 00:46:32,733
Why wouldn't he want you
to follow in his footsteps?

596
00:46:32,757 --> 00:46:34,592
Hard living.

597
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,394
Ain't no money in it.

598
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,942
Well if you don't
know what you want,

599
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:44,069
you ain't never
going to find it.

600
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:46,604
You'll always settle for less.

601
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:51,609
You'll wander around
aimlessly wondering

602
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,512
how the hell did
life land me here?

603
00:46:57,082 --> 00:46:58,249
How do you know this?

604
00:46:58,283 --> 00:46:59,094
Huh?

605
00:46:59,118 --> 00:47:00,852
Your vast experience?

606
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,589
I was talking about you.

607
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:05,822
Not me.

608
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:08,958
Tell me.

609
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,336
I'm a Texas gal.

610
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,250
Coke really means Doctor Pepper.

611
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:25,987
Can't have the Alamo
without "Lonesome Dove",

612
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:28,446
and all the roses are yellow.

613
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,162
I like a beer just as
much as the next guy but,

614
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:38,289
Rollins, what I am
ain't about valor.

615
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,940
I live my life
like my daddy did.

616
00:47:45,964 --> 00:47:47,698
His daddy before him.

617
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,702
Eight seconds at a time.

618
00:47:57,242 --> 00:48:00,912
Only I do it with the
fucking handbreak off.

619
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,698
Come on.

620
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,890
We've still got work to do.

621
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:21,166
How long have you
been a deputy, Adams?

622
00:48:24,035 --> 00:48:25,536
Longer than you.

623
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:30,041
Everybody's been a
deputy longer than me.

624
00:48:33,178 --> 00:48:34,378
Six years.

625
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:42,163
You spent half of your
career chasing this asshole?

626
00:48:42,187 --> 00:48:44,022
Something like that.

627
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:49,559
Ready?

628
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:51,661
Yeah.

629
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:08,345
It's the weight room.

630
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:10,381
We circled back around.

631
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:12,283
I'm right behind you.

632
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:33,337
Anything?

633
00:49:35,073 --> 00:49:36,317
Nothing.

634
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:37,275
All right.

635
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,452
Let's knock it off the list.

636
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,410
You can lock the
door on our way out.

637
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:40,754
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

638
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:41,946
What is it?

639
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:45,726
I don't fucking
know, but I heard it.

640
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:48,930
Whoa!

641
00:49:48,954 --> 00:49:50,231
Where are you going?

642
00:49:50,255 --> 00:49:51,065
I heard someone in the hall.

643
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:51,898
Yeah, no shit.

644
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:52,734
But what did you say?

645
00:49:52,758 --> 00:49:54,668
Stick together, right?

646
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,461
Don't tell me you're
afraid of the dark.

647
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,805
First we check here,
then we'll check there.

648
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:59,640
Okay?

649
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:00,474
Together.

650
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:01,409
All right?

651
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:02,967
- Excuse me.
- Fuck.

652
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:14,355
Adams?

653
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:15,579
Adams!

654
00:50:18,716 --> 00:50:21,119
Adams, open the fucking door!

655
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:23,253
Adams!

656
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:25,456
Adams, open the fucking door!

657
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:45,743
Adams!

658
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:46,854
Fucking bitch!

659
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:48,346
Fuck!

660
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:56,581
What did she tell you about me?

661
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:04,821
Where is it?

662
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,370
Where is it?

663
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:27,954
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

664
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,490
You don't know what
I'm talking about,

665
00:52:29,514 --> 00:52:33,284
you are so full of shit,
your eyes are brown.

666
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:41,626
Son, I can tell
when a man is lying.

667
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:43,937
I'm looking at
your fucking eyes.

668
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:45,162
You are a liar.

669
00:52:47,432 --> 00:52:49,133
Fuck you.

670
00:52:55,306 --> 00:52:57,618
I should tell you, these work.

671
00:52:57,642 --> 00:52:59,953
Where the fuck
did you get those?

672
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:01,288
Huh?

673
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:04,048
What the fuck did
you do with her?

674
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:12,021
Hey.

675
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,959
I'm asking the questions.

676
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:20,831
You are tied to a
fucking chair by me.

677
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:27,715
Fuck you.

678
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:29,640
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

679
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:31,008
Hey, look at me.

680
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:34,979
You wanted to fuck
her, didn't you?

681
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:38,983
- Fuck you!
- Yep.

682
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:42,496
You thought you was
going to fuck her.

683
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:46,891
I tell you what, you respect
me, or you respect this.

684
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:52,373
Now you tell me
where the fuck it is.

685
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:53,898
Right now.

686
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:58,002
Or so help me, God, you will
not have blue eyes anymore,

687
00:53:58,035 --> 00:53:59,480
you get me?

688
00:53:59,504 --> 00:54:00,381
Okay, okay.

689
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:01,339
Okay!

690
00:54:01,372 --> 00:54:02,373
- Okay what?
- Okay.

691
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:03,350
Just get Adams.

692
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:04,184
Get Adams.

693
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:05,018
Get Adams!

694
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:05,919
Adams!

695
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:07,143
You want me to get Adams?

696
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,422
- Get Adams.
- And bring her here?

697
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:10,214
She'll know what
you're looking for.

698
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,158
Yes.

699
00:54:11,182 --> 00:54:12,393
She can help you find it, man.

700
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:14,828
She can fucking
help you find it.

701
00:54:14,852 --> 00:54:16,052
Interesting.

702
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:21,726
Well, I guess I
better go get Adams.

703
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:22,959
Okay.

704
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:30,511
Motherfucker.

705
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:34,805
Here she is, pretty boy.

706
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:37,173
Adams, stay.

707
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:51,932
All right, your boy here
wants to play games,

708
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:53,458
so let's play some
fucking games.

709
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:55,259
Please tell him where they are.

710
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,270
How about Operation.

711
00:54:56,294 --> 00:54:57,571
That's fun and games.

712
00:54:57,595 --> 00:54:58,473
Wait.

713
00:54:58,497 --> 00:55:00,064
This is your last chance.

714
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:00,907
No.

715
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:01,875
Please don't.

716
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:03,099
Wait!

717
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:07,237
We'll give you
whatever you want, man.

718
00:55:07,271 --> 00:55:08,949
I still don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

719
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:10,441
Tell him where it is, Rollins.

720
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:12,052
Please, just tell
him where it is.

721
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:13,387
Tell him where it is, Rollins.

722
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:14,278
Please.

723
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,489
- What?
- You have to.

724
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:17,324
What the fuck are
you talking about?

725
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:18,493
He's going to kill me.

726
00:55:18,517 --> 00:55:19,750
Please.

727
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:20,628
Wait!

728
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:22,286
All right.

729
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,797
I was in records, man.

730
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:26,132
I know where everything
is in this building, okay.

731
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:26,967
Okay?

732
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:27,802
Okay?

733
00:55:27,826 --> 00:55:29,126
Okay.

734
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,359
Okay.

735
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:31,738
Yeah.

736
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:32,930
We're gonna find it.

737
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,140
We're gonna find it.

738
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,166
I just don't know
what it is yet.

739
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,802
This bitch knows.

740
00:55:41,038 --> 00:55:42,238
What?

741
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:46,342
The buckle.

742
00:55:49,514 --> 00:55:51,682
- What?
- The belt buckle.

743
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:55,829
What the fuck are
you talking about?

744
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,558
Whoops.

745
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:13,804
You went a little
heavy, don't you think?

746
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:17,174
You said
make it believable.

747
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:23,223
You two motherfuckers.

748
00:56:23,247 --> 00:56:25,516
You're in it together, huh?

749
00:56:28,553 --> 00:56:29,753
Surprise.

750
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:35,892
Abner Outlaw.

751
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:38,127
You know him?

752
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:41,908
Of course you do.

753
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:43,877
All those nights spent
at the cowboy camp.

754
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,870
You heard the stories, right?

755
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:46,714
I know them.

756
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:48,205
So what?

757
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,985
So you know that Abner could
do anything in the arena.

758
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,950
Generation after generation
of championship rodeo.

759
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:04,922
And just like all the Texas
Rangers before him, he wore it

760
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:06,756
on his belt.

761
00:57:08,526 --> 00:57:11,028
One buckle more than the rest.

762
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:19,269
His great grandfather's
1920 gold-plated Cow Palace.

763
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:28,713
I don't have anything
to do with that.

764
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:31,892
I think you do, records boy.

765
00:57:31,916 --> 00:57:34,861
He was here three weeks ago.

766
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,362
He came in on D and D.

767
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,255
He spent a night in
the tank on his way

768
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,234
to Colorado Springs
for a PRCA auction.

769
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:44,595
When he booked in,
he had the buckle.

770
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:47,131
And when he checked out, gone.

771
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,903
Why don't you just ask him?

772
00:57:52,937 --> 00:57:54,137
Hmm?

773
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,576
We know that it's
here, record boy.

774
00:57:59,944 --> 00:58:01,988
Abner had a suit
against your sheriff

775
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:06,016
and this county because
it was stolen here.

776
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,618
By who?

777
00:58:07,652 --> 00:58:10,931
I've got nothing
to do with this.

778
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:12,790
I'm fucking brand new.

779
00:58:14,358 --> 00:58:18,195
Smart money says you
know where they hid it.

780
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:26,170
Who?

781
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,039
Your sheriff.

782
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:34,612
Why the fuck would he
do something like that?

783
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:41,327
Because Abner Outlaw's buckle,
sold to the right buyer

784
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:45,055
is worth over a quarter
of a million dollars.

785
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:47,968
You planned this.

786
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:49,870
You've been planning
this all night.

787
00:58:49,894 --> 00:58:52,563
Well he's finally catching on.

788
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:55,008
Yeah, you know what?

789
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:57,902
I've been planning
this night all week.

790
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:02,139
So here's what's
going to happen.

791
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:08,689
You're going to take me
to the property room,

792
00:59:08,713 --> 00:59:11,916
because you know
where that is, right?

793
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:13,960
You know where they hide things

794
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:16,887
they don't want no
one else to see.

795
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:22,525
Right?

796
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:29,734
Crazy bitch.

797
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,338
And one more thing.

798
00:59:36,074 --> 00:59:38,275
Ah, Jesus fucking Christ!

799
00:59:38,342 --> 00:59:39,677
Jesus Christ!

800
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,879
Why the fuck did you do that?

801
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,247
You crazy bitch.

802
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,551
Three is a crowd.

803
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,455
But look on the bright side,

804
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,964
if you play your cards right,

805
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:04,969
you might get his share.

806
01:00:16,146 --> 01:00:17,381
You smell good.

807
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:21,618
So you want to have some fun?

808
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,102
Hey, whoa.

809
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:29,936
I said property.

810
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,095
This is your office.

811
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,328
I know that.

812
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,041
You think if he wanted
a $250,000 belt buckle

813
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:36,901
he'd just leave it
out in the open?

814
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:40,004
I'm looking for keys
to the basement.

815
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:44,050
Was any of it true?

816
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:45,609
Russell?

817
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,087
The pills?

818
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:50,915
Jesus Christ, are you
even a real fucking cop?

819
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,594
Russell is crazy.

820
01:00:54,618 --> 01:00:56,120
Well, he was crazy.

821
01:00:59,957 --> 01:01:01,792
I met him up in Reno.

822
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:05,171
He came in handy
when he needed to.

823
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:06,973
He was a fucking junkie.

824
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,699
He'd sell that buckle
in three months

825
01:01:08,766 --> 01:01:12,102
and be out on the street,
looking to score again.

826
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:14,471
Can't trust a guy like that.

827
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,009
As for me, I'm a rodeo girl.

828
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,823
Rodeo?

829
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:24,047
Yeah.

830
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:28,318
You and me, we have
something in common.

831
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:29,854
Two peas in a pod.

832
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:35,059
I grew up on a horse farm.

833
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,063
I still love to ride.

834
01:01:41,465 --> 01:01:44,802
Dressage, events and
jumping, all of it.

835
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:50,951
The problem was, the minute
the oil rigs dried up,

836
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,676
my daddy lost it all.

837
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:56,189
The farm.

838
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,413
300 acres.

839
01:01:58,015 --> 01:02:00,484
The house not long after that.

840
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,720
The horses were all that
we had left to sell,

841
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:05,655
and that's what we did.

842
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:11,204
I guess it's a no-brainer.

843
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:16,100
The choice between livestock
and putting food on the table.

844
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,537
So that's what
all this is about?

845
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:21,748
Jesus.

846
01:02:21,772 --> 01:02:24,108
And I thought I
had daddy issues.

847
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:29,346
I traded horse trials
for tie-down calf roping,

848
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:32,883
so don't you fucking
tell me about issues.

849
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:38,355
Most the guys my age couldn't
hang for as long as I did.

850
01:02:38,388 --> 01:02:39,924
So what happened?

851
01:02:43,627 --> 01:02:47,273
I heard all the
same story as you.

852
01:02:47,297 --> 01:02:48,565
Outlaw's stuck.

853
01:02:50,034 --> 01:02:53,037
I laid the charge
on breaker myself.

854
01:02:54,038 --> 01:02:55,806
And you in here alone.

855
01:02:56,941 --> 01:03:00,186
A deputy for all of 36 hours.

856
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,545
Easy to convince.

857
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:04,113
And Jelly?

858
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,319
Who the fuck cares?

859
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:11,765
Right?

860
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:13,599
Collateral damage.

861
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,068
Shit happens.

862
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:16,493
Yeah, I got it.

863
01:03:19,096 --> 01:03:20,406
Now there looks like
there's a reason

864
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,808
for both of us to get
the belt buckle, huh?

865
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:23,276
Isn't that right?

866
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,111
Oh, no.

867
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:25,802
That buckle is mine.

868
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:30,817
You've been planning
this night all week?

869
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:33,177
I've been planning
this shit all month.

870
01:03:36,113 --> 01:03:37,313
Oh, shit.

871
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:44,754
First night on the job, eh?

872
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:47,956
Hmm.

873
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:52,096
The rain stopped.

874
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:53,673
I guess we have a
decision to make.

875
01:03:53,697 --> 01:03:55,032
Not really.

876
01:03:55,099 --> 01:03:56,742
I ain't going in
with no partner.

877
01:03:56,766 --> 01:03:58,078
Put the gun down and
get on your knees.

878
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:01,605
No chance.

879
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:03,749
You have me pegged
all wrong, Adams.

880
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:06,443
You don't know a thing about me.

881
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:12,292
Well I do know you're just
pretending to be a cop.

882
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:13,927
Kind of like me.

883
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:16,486
You shouldn't have come here.

884
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:20,556
Fuck.

885
01:04:32,636 --> 01:04:33,836
Adams!

886
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,906
Where are you?

887
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:48,884
Oh, Adams.

888
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:54,024
Jelly is looking for you.

889
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:59,529
Where are you, you crazy bitch?

890
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:19,915
Adams.

891
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,454
Oh, shit!

892
01:05:36,466 --> 01:05:37,801
Die, bitch, die!

893
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:42,282
Get up.

894
01:05:42,306 --> 01:05:43,506
Get up!

895
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:45,285
Against the wall.

896
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:46,376
Against the wall.

897
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:47,911
Whoa, little lamb.

898
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,115
You're under arrest.

899
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:53,383
You have the right
to remain silent.

900
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:55,919
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

901
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,197
in a court of law.

902
01:05:57,221 --> 01:05:58,722
You piece of shit.

903
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,768
How long did it take
you to learn that?

904
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:11,711
Come on, motherfucker.

905
01:06:11,735 --> 01:06:12,546
Rollins.

906
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:15,105
Fucking wild animal.

907
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:16,339
Oh, Rollins.

908
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,076
- Shut up.
- No, no, no.

909
01:06:19,109 --> 01:06:20,309
- You- - Shh.

910
01:06:21,745 --> 01:06:24,657
- Hey, hey you don't- - Shh.

911
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:25,881
Shh.

912
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:26,559
You don't have to
put me in there.

913
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:27,293
Oh, no?

914
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:28,128
Why?

915
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:28,961
Why not?

916
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,154
No please.

917
01:06:30,187 --> 01:06:31,121
Please don't put me
in there- Oh, no.

918
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:32,065
You'll like it in there with

919
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:32,966
all that mumbo jumbo the fuck

920
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,325
you were talking about earlier?

921
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,527
Huh?

922
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:38,795
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

923
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,028
What, what?

924
01:06:40,964 --> 01:06:41,774
Hey, what?

925
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:42,643
Why?

926
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:44,601
- If you had- - Huh?

927
01:06:44,634 --> 01:06:47,247
If you had it this
whole time, why did you,

928
01:06:47,271 --> 01:06:48,182
why did you wait?

929
01:06:48,206 --> 01:06:49,649
Why?

930
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:53,677
Well, before you killed him
Jelly was my escape plan.

931
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:55,545
All he had to do
was take that buckle

932
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:57,657
and meet me after my shift.

933
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:59,849
I had his charges dropped.

934
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:05,131
Fuck all that now, huh?

935
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:07,324
You trusted him?

936
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:08,668
Yeah, more than you.

937
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,936
Get your fucking ass in there.

938
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,196
Fucking animal.

939
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:15,999
Turn around.

940
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,477
Is that how you like it?

941
01:07:17,501 --> 01:07:19,212
Shut the fuck up,
you sick freak.

942
01:07:19,236 --> 01:07:20,436
Turn around.

943
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:28,345
After all this is over,
I suggest you get help.

944
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:30,557
All right.

945
01:07:30,581 --> 01:07:33,250
If you fucking
need anything, Hey!

946
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:35,427
Get your shit out of my face.

947
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:36,896
Rollins, Rollins,
Rollins, Rollins,

948
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,089
Rollins, Rollins, Rollins.

949
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:08,594
Whew whee.

950
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:09,719
Look at that.

951
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:10,897
Just, just let me.

952
01:08:10,921 --> 01:08:12,232
Is this was everybody died for?

953
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:13,423
Just let me touch it.

954
01:08:13,457 --> 01:08:14,734
I just want to
touch it one time.

955
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:16,901
Just let- Get your
hands out of here.

956
01:08:16,925 --> 01:08:18,428
It ain't much when
you look at it.

957
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:19,962
It's a damn shame.

958
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:24,434
Well, adios, Adams.

959
01:08:25,402 --> 01:08:26,602
Hey, hey.

960
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:31,083
What are you, what are you
going to tell the sheriff?

961
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,976
Let me think.

962
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:33,854
I'm not.

963
01:08:33,878 --> 01:08:35,288
You are.

964
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:37,257
Rollins.

965
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:40,083
You and me, you and
me, we could be a team.

966
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:40,926
No, no.

967
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,095
You're a smart girl.

968
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:43,596
You'll figure something out.

969
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,156
- Rollins, Rollins!
- Fuck you.

970
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:48,657
Fuck!

971
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:05,206
Rollins.

972
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:14,849
Rollins.

973
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:18,786
Oh, Rollins.

974
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:26,128
Hey, cowboy.

975
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:29,798
Rollins.

976
01:09:42,513 --> 01:09:44,490
Give it to me.

977
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:45,714
Uh-uh.

978
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,118
Fucking snake.

979
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,865
Looks like we have
a decision to make.

980
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:55,725
What do you propose?

981
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,464
You let me out.

982
01:10:02,566 --> 01:10:03,710
Yeah?

983
01:10:03,734 --> 01:10:05,669
Then we can settle it up.

984
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:06,902
50-50.

985
01:10:08,071 --> 01:10:09,172
70-30.

986
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,016
Nope, nope.

987
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,684
No, no, no, no, no.

988
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:12,908
No!

989
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:15,645
I have the key.

990
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,280
50-50.

991
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:20,360
Fuck you.

992
01:10:20,384 --> 01:10:21,193
Stay in there.

993
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,026
I don't give a shit.

994
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:22,862
Okay, okay, okay.

995
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:23,696
Yeah, yeah.

996
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,897
Okay.

997
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:28,425
Because then the sheriff
comes and nobody wins.

998
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,475
We sell it when I want.

999
01:10:35,499 --> 01:10:36,333
To who I want.

1000
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:37,176
Where I want.

1001
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,010
Do you understand that?

1002
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:39,234
Say it!

1003
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,373
Sir, yes, sir.

1004
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:48,712
I should have my
fucking head checked.

1005
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:59,121
You and I are going to
have some fun together.

1006
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:00,189
No we aren't.

1007
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:01,423
Yeah.

1008
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,206
Fucking bitch.

1009
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,563
You know, Rollins, I'm curious.

1010
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:42,908
Is that how you do
it in Tarrant County.

1011
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:44,132
Hmm?

1012
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:49,773
Is that how you
search your suspects?

1013
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:52,274
Bitch.

1014
01:11:53,677 --> 01:11:55,287
Yeah.

1015
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:56,511
Well, I'm out.

1016
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:01,951
You shouldn't mess
with a Texas girl.

1017
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:17,199
Later, gator.

1018
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:21,803
Yes.

1019
01:12:23,873 --> 01:12:25,273
No, I understand.

1020
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:29,212
Well I have seller
with me at the moment.

1021
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:32,816
So I'm going to have
to get back to you.

1022
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:33,694
Understood.

1023
01:12:33,718 --> 01:12:36,152
We'll be in touch soon.

1024
01:12:36,184 --> 01:12:37,430
Sorry about that.

1025
01:12:37,454 --> 01:12:40,700
Lots of call this time of year.

1026
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:42,058
Well, all right.

1027
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,159
There she is.

1028
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:46,729
All right.

1029
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:01,944
Are we good?

1030
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:07,226
What did we agree to?

1031
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:08,450
250.

1032
01:13:10,153 --> 01:13:13,490
250 sounds about
right for this piece.

1033
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:23,632
250 bucks.

1034
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,582
What's all this?

1035
01:13:29,606 --> 01:13:31,050
Some kind of joke?

1036
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:32,041
It's $250.

1037
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:34,243
And this is a counterfeit.

1038
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,780
No, no, no.

1039
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:41,951
That is Abner Outlaw's buckle.

1040
01:13:42,018 --> 01:13:43,853
We agreed to $250,000.

1041
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:50,035
Because this, this is
Abner Outlaw's belt buckle.

1042
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:52,061
Okay, well, look here.

1043
01:13:53,196 --> 01:13:57,200
Each Cow Palace original
dated prior to 1945

1044
01:13:57,233 --> 01:14:02,138
is engraved with the year and
the finish number on the back.

1045
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:05,041
This buckle has
neither of those.

1046
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:06,251
I'm sorry.

1047
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,520
It's nothing more
than a counterfeit.

1048
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:10,088
This is, this is
Outlaw's buckle.

1049
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,312
It's a fake.

1050
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:14,618
No, it's not.

1051
01:14:17,452 --> 01:14:18,655
I'm sorry.

1052
01:14:18,722 --> 01:14:20,299
You can go and try and
find another buyer.

1053
01:14:20,323 --> 01:14:22,767
But I've been doing
this for 25 years,

1054
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,470
and what I just handed
you is more valuable

1055
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:27,396
than what I'm taking
in right here.

1056
01:14:28,498 --> 01:14:29,698
I'm sorry.

1057
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:36,305
This is his buckle.

1058
01:14:50,353 --> 01:14:51,553
Fuck!

1059
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:06,513
Jesus Christ, Abner.

1060
01:15:06,537 --> 01:15:08,180
You scared the shit out of me.

1061
01:15:08,204 --> 01:15:11,641
I didn't expect you
to be here this fast.

1062
01:15:19,616 --> 01:15:22,952
If Sheriff comes
looking, you call me.

1063
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,061
Rollins!

1064
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:42,237
Rollins?

1065
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:52,446
Rollins!

1066
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:03,827
How are you doing
in there, Jelly?

1067
01:16:05,528 --> 01:16:06,728
Shit.

1068
01:17:05,054 --> 01:17:06,254
Rollins?

1069
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:10,625
Shit.

1070
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:36,851
Shit!

1071
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,201
Shit.
