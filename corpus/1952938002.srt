1
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,266
When I think back about that summer,

2
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,800
I don't think much about the army.

3
00:00:19,911 --> 00:00:23,207
There was always
some sort of conflict going on.

4
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:25,211
Towns would attack each other

5
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:28,007
if a golf course was built
too close to a border,

6
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:31,637
or if a shopping centre
gave off too much light pollution.

7
00:00:33,779 --> 00:00:38,972
So now, what I really try and think about
are my friends from back then.

8
00:00:39,012 --> 00:00:41,774
It was the summer Winter cut his hair.

9
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:47,270
I wish I could remember every little moment.

10
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:50,741
But I can't.

11
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:54,302
Why do I only remember
the moments that I do?

12
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,505
I wonder what happened
to the other moments.

13
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:03,735
I wonder what happened to Winter.

14
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,673
- What are you kids up to?
- Nothing. Just a little up dog.

15
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:14,205
- What's up dog?
- Nothing much. You?

16
00:03:15,051 --> 00:03:17,539
You're under arrest.

17
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:19,709
Take it easy.

18
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,144
Did you see that freak with the trench coat?

19
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:30,241
What's wrong with having one?
I have a trench coat.

20
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:32,112
What's wrong with owning a trench coat?

21
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,675
Serial killers and Columbine people
wear trench coats.

22
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:39,616
Or people that just like to masturbate
in public every now and then.

23
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:43,208
True. You don't want to date someone
who masturbates in public.

24
00:03:43,251 --> 00:03:47,774
- So you don't masturbate in public?
- Never. That is a sin.

25
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:51,212
OK, that's a lie.

26
00:03:52,852 --> 00:03:56,340
Ready? One, two,
two and a half...

27
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:58,011
three.

28
00:03:58,918 --> 00:04:03,316
Yeah. You're my bitch now.
You like that, boy?

29
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:08,281
Jesus! When did you get so strong?

30
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,012
I do yoga. Yoga, man.

31
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:13,212
Corpse pose, downward dog,
you know what I'm saying?

32
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,740
I'm thoroughly impressed.

33
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:17,013
You guys are in love with each other.

34
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:19,177
Yeah, that's kind of true.

35
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:42,281
How do I know
when, like, it's OK to kiss a girl?

36
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,377
When the time is right?

37
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,147
Well, you could just get totally hammered

38
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,777
and fall into her face like this one did.

39
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:52,717
- No, don't do that.
- No way.

40
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:55,776
- What was the situation?
- We were at a party.

41
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:58,047
- Was she staring at you?
- Yeah.

42
00:04:58,086 --> 00:05:00,609
We're just sitting there
and she was right next to me.

43
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:02,915
- Was she drunk?
- I don't think so.

44
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:05,351
She didn't act like it.
We were all at a party, so who knows.

45
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:07,979
That's obviously a big factor,
cos if she was sober

46
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,782
it's much different than if she was fucked up.

47
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,343
No, but, like, how do I go about just...

48
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:16,615
Delivering the cock to her?

49
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:19,119
Yeah, delivering the cock to her.

50
00:05:19,154 --> 00:05:21,450
I think there's a missing link
somewhere in there.

51
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:27,618
So, when the situation comes
and you, like, think it's gonna be cool,

52
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:30,085
you lean in 60% of the way, right?

53
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,179
And then you let her go 40.
So then it's, like, consensual.

54
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:37,779
And you're not, like, forcing it on her.
All right?

55
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:39,878
I learned that from Hitch.

56
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:43,853
Wait.
You watched Hitch?

57
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:46,979
- He loves Will Smith.
- Yeah, he's a good actor.

58
00:05:47,022 --> 00:05:50,455
Yeah. Oh, man, what a loser.

59
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:52,954
I'm a loser?
What the fuck is on your head?

60
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:55,045
What are you talking about?

61
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,077
Did you, like, actually pay money for that?

62
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:59,088
Fuck you guys, this hat's awesome.

63
00:06:00,122 --> 00:06:02,645
God damn!

64
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:04,985
I'm just trying out a new look.

65
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:51,423
Nice ass!

66
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,284
When did his brother get back?

67
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:37,689
I don't know.
I didn't know he got out.

68
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:21,616
He wants you to move schools now?

69
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:24,182
He can't just make you go to Westlake.

70
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:28,091
It's just that he thinks
that I need more discipline and focus.

71
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:31,723
Why don't you just talk to him about it?

72
00:08:32,226 --> 00:08:34,386
I can't talk to him.

73
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:36,290
It's like...

74
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:43,716
It's like he's not even human any more.

75
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:50,352
He's really weird,
but he's definitely a human.

76
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:52,883
What he's trying to say
is your brother's a dick.

77
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:54,950
- Shut up, Paulo.
- Fuck you, man.

78
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:57,687
I'm just saying he treats you
like you're his little bitch.

79
00:08:57,727 --> 00:09:00,249
Shut the fuck up, Paulo.

80
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:28,759
We're coming up to the border.
You guys have your IDs?

81
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:30,192
Here.

82
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:37,885
Here you go, man.

83
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:55,286
Let's see some identification.

84
00:09:59,496 --> 00:10:03,792
Sorry. Borders are closed
to all Crossvine residents today.

85
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:05,692
Oakridge residents only.

86
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:07,922
Go ahead and pop the trunk for me.

87
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,062
So what brings y'all to Oakridge today?

88
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:13,561
We're going to visit y'all's mall.

89
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:15,654
- Visit our mall?
- Yes.

90
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:18,458
- Anything in the car I need to know about?
- No, sir.

91
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:22,224
- No weapons, drugs, paraphernalia?
- No, sir.

92
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:24,957
- Is he lying to me?
- No, sir.

93
00:10:24,997 --> 00:10:27,326
All right, turn your car around
and get out of here.

94
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,262
Kyle...

95
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,664
..do you like humanity?

96
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:30,057
Yeah. Yes, sir.

97
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,391
Why?

98
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,396
Well, we're all humans and...

99
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:42,491
I like humans, so...

100
00:13:00,402 --> 00:13:03,266
Can I be excused, please?
I need to go to the restroom.

101
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:06,992
Thank you.

102
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:43,495
What did you do today?

103
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:46,025
Not much. Just...

104
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:49,630
- You know...
- I'm right here.

105
00:13:49,669 --> 00:13:51,362
Sorry.

106
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:55,029
I just hung out with Kyle and...

107
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,596
That's pretty much it.

108
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:04,427
Winter, I gotta say...

109
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:07,693
I'm worried about you.

110
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:19,531
- Bye, kids!
- Bye, Mrs. Mo Capaldi.

111
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,933
- Nuggets on the house, y'all!
- Right on.

112
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:25,435
Eat up.

113
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:28,966
That's a sexy outfit you've got on.

114
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:31,526
Thanks, Zeke.
You don't look so bad yourself.

115
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:36,797
Winter, get some nuggets
before they're all gone.

116
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:38,894
Dude, those things are disgusting.

117
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:43,363
- Hey, you missed a spot.
- Where?

118
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:46,394
- Where? Right here?
- No.

119
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:48,802
You came out nice and clean.

120
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:06,071
There's this one guy, Amir Love.

121
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,204
And his dad was a doctor, Dr. Love.

122
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:14,034
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

123
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,895
- And guess what his dad did.
- What?

124
00:15:16,938 --> 00:15:20,063
He was a vagina doctor.

125
00:15:20,105 --> 00:15:21,731
My doctor is Asian.

126
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:27,631
- How long is a Chinaman?
- How long is...

127
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:30,832
How Long is a Chinaman.

128
00:15:30,873 --> 00:15:33,737
No, his name's How Long.

129
00:15:34,873 --> 00:15:37,032
He's a Chinaman.

130
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,397
I heard Asians sleep
on really hard mattresses.

131
00:15:49,874 --> 00:15:52,840
You guys hear what Sander said, right?

132
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:54,634
His parents,

133
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:57,797
from when he was born
till he was, like, three or four,

134
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,704
had this big round bed, and it spun,

135
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,070
and they would leave it on all the time.

136
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:09,596
And so all the time, when he'd, like,
he'd go into his parents' room, like...

137
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,868
And people would come over
and just make that noise.

138
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,370
And that's how Sander was made.

139
00:16:16,407 --> 00:16:18,271
What was that noise again?

140
00:16:20,474 --> 00:16:22,405
Guys!

141
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,033
I have something I need to tell you.

142
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,797
You're all characters

143
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:40,804
in a dream that I'm having.

144
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,697
I'm gonna wake up

145
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:48,634
and I'm gonna go back to my world.

146
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:55,097
But I don't know
what's gonna happen to you guys.

147
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,470
No more weed for Winter.

148
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:10,407
That was a weird dream.

149
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,275
Do not move!

150
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:53,442
- Stay on the fence.
- Do not move! Let me see those hands!

151
00:17:53,477 --> 00:17:54,999
Let me see those hands!

152
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:56,771
Open your mouth!

153
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,140
Open your fucking mouth!

154
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:01,468
Open your mouth wider.

155
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,067
Relax.

156
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,167
All right, get the next kid.
Turn him around.

157
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,574
- All right.
- Open your mouth!

158
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:08,372
Your turn, pretty boy! Open your mouth!

159
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:11,309
Let's see in there. Nice and wide! Open up.

160
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:14,876
- All right, turn back around.
- Turn around, pretty boy.

161
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,809
What's your name?

162
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:19,072
What's your name, Mr. Haircut? Come on!

163
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:20,770
What's your name?

164
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:23,709
I asked what your name was?
What is your name?

165
00:18:23,744 --> 00:18:24,869
Stop!

166
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:27,377
Your little boyfriend's crying for you!
Tell me your name!

167
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:28,570
Tell him your fuckin' name!

168
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:32,805
I asked you a question!
What is your name?

169
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,037
His name is Winter Miller.

170
00:18:37,712 --> 00:18:40,836
Winter Miller, huh?
That's a pretty name for a pretty boy.

171
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:42,868
Thanks a lot, little friend.

172
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:50,777
- Everyone, move out!
- Come on. Let's go.

173
00:18:50,812 --> 00:18:52,937
Go on, move.

174
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,805
Hey, is Winter home?

175
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:48,213
No, he's not home.

176
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,676
Well, do you know where he is?

177
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:05,244
All righty, then. See you later.

178
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:56,344
- Hey.
- Hey, man, what's up?

179
00:20:58,249 --> 00:20:59,681
What's going on?

180
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:03,046
I just knocked on the door
and Terrance answered.

181
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:07,071
- Did he seem pissed?
- He seemed pretty normal.

182
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,982
What you watching?

183
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:13,005
I don't know.

184
00:21:29,116 --> 00:21:32,310
What have you been up to?
I've tried calling you. Where you been?

185
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:38,140
Just been taking some time off
by myself down here.

186
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:42,276
- That sucks.
- No, actually it's been really good.

187
00:22:06,718 --> 00:22:09,047
We've been really worried about you.

188
00:22:10,318 --> 00:22:13,375
I don't need your fuckin' pity.

189
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,384
I appreciate it,

190
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,543
but you both have enough
of your own problems to deal with, OK?

191
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:11,183
Whatever our town was fighting about,

192
00:25:11,223 --> 00:25:13,485
the feeling of fear and waiting...

193
00:25:13,524 --> 00:25:15,854
it all seems so distant now.

194
00:25:23,057 --> 00:25:26,148
I guess those aren't the pieces you remember.

195
00:25:33,424 --> 00:25:36,822
Now I close my eyes
and try and go back there.

196
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:48,188
I've seen Winter around some
over the years and he's only gotten weirder.

197
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:54,750
Sometimes what he's become
changes how I remember him.

198
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,353
Sometimes it doesn't.
