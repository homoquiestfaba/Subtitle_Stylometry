00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:39,610
<i>so he was raised to look up
to powerful criminals,</i>

167
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:42,246
who employed his mom,
and kept them alive.

168
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:46,149
Buffalo was the third largest Mafia
family after New York and Chicago.

169
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,487
So, the motherfuckers had, like,
noses over here named Guido,

170
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:52,989
<i>you know, "Fuck you, Paulie" and shit.</i>

171
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,292
<i>I mean, these guys were
straight gangsters, man.</i>

172
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:57,160
So, Mama did a good job.

173
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:59,195
You gotta remember,
there were eight in his family,

174
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:00,785
so he didn't dress the best, but, you

175
00:08:00,786 --> 00:08:02,599
know, he looked good
whatever he had on.

176
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,967
JUDGE: <i>Betty Gladden was a single mom</i>

177
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:07,570
<i>and a former Cotton Club showgirl.</i>

178
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,472
Rick had music in his soul,

179
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:11,808
and she encouraged him tremendously.

180
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:14,444
She really had a feeling
for her baby, man.

181
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:17,314
JUDGE:<i> She tried to keep Rick and
his seven brothers and sisters</i>

182
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:20,382
<i>off the streets by
raising them Catholic.</i>

183
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:22,618
<i>Rick even spent time as an altar boy.</i>

184
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:25,621
I had met Rick James
in the third grade.

185
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:29,125
At the time, he was
James Ambrose Johnson Jr.,

186
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:31,928
<i>who had bad teeth, like
I did, had bad teeth.</i>

187
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,163
We were two little dudes,
I mean, real little.

188
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:36,365
<i>Played against each other in
football and stuff like that.</i>

189
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,400
- (GRUNTS)
- I didn't think he could sing,

190
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:40,078
but he could holler
real well back then.

191
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:42,238
- (HOLLERING)
- But he was a loud mouth.

192
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,040
Always talkin' 'bout music.

193
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,608
Rick realized his gifts early on.

194
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,445
His musicality is so flexible,

195
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,881
he can do jazz and black R&B,

196
00:08:52,882 --> 00:08:54,216
or white rock 'n roll,

197
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:57,352
and he doesn't know
exactly which way to go.

198
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:59,821
His mother was his guiding light.

199
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:03,058
<i>I mean, she used to take him
to, uh, bars and nightclubs</i>

200
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,359
<i>when he was a little guy.</i>

201
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,427
<i>Not the other kids, but just him.</i>

202
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:08,363
<i>Because she saw in him something.</i>

203
00:09:08,364 --> 00:09:10,431
I didn't, personally.

204
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:13,101
JUDGE: <i>As a teenager,
he lied about his age,</i>

205
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:15,937
<i>and joined the Navy
to try to avoid the draft.</i>

206
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:18,373
<i>At the time, a lot of
young men from the ghetto</i>

207
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:21,475
<i>were being sent to fight
and die in Vietnam.</i>

208
00:09:21,878 --> 00:09:23,478
I don't know if people realize,

209
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,680
but Rick went AWOL, a lot.

210
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:29,583
But I've heard as high as 13 times.

211
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:31,818
JUDGE: <i>William Rhinehart sang backup</i>

212
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:34,054
<i>and played saxophone
with the Stone City Band</i>

213
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:35,756
<i>throughout the glory years.</i>

214
00:09:35,757 --> 00:09:38,125
<i>He witnessed, firsthand,
the discipline and drive</i>

215
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:40,227
<i>it takes to be the king of funk.</i>

216
00:09:40,228 --> 00:09:43,063
Rick was one of these guys
that nobody's gonna tell him,

217
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:46,333
"I gotta stop playing music
and go fight people in Vietnam"

218
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:48,168
He just wasn't gonna hear that.

219
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:51,671
Well, when your number comes up, you
have to report. Rick did not report.

220
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:53,573
<i>He refused to fight.</i>

221
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:57,144
His mother would sneak him
to and from Canada.

222
00:09:57,145 --> 00:09:59,246
Buffalo's right over the
border from Canada.

223
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:01,281
<i>You can go to Niagara Falls
in about 20 minutes,</i>

224
00:10:01,282 --> 00:10:04,418
<i>and then you drive another 30,
40 minutes, you're in Ontario.</i>

225
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:07,086
His mother, she had his back.

226
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:10,256
I mean, she would do anything for him.
She loved her some Rick.

227
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:12,225
I think that was her favorite child.

228
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:14,027
I mean, seriously.

229
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:17,063
JUDGE: <i>In Canada, the kid with
the buck teeth and the big voice</i>

230
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:20,033
<i>caught the attention of some
up-and-coming rock 'n rollers.</i>

231
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:22,836
<i>trying to capitalize on the R&B craze.</i>

232
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:26,105
<i>And that's how Rick James ended
up in the protest scene,</i>

233
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:29,275
<i>and playing in a band with Neil Young.</i>

234
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:31,678
RITZ: <i>He kind of finds
himself in a Neil Young,</i>

235
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,548
Joni Mitchell, anti-war, protest-y,

236
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:38,518
hippie, white, alternative culture.

237
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:41,254
JUDGE: <i>He fronted a band
called the Mynah Birds,</i>

238
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:43,189
<i>with Neil Young on guitar,</i>

239
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,960
<i>as well as other founding members of
Buffalo Springfield and Steppenwolf.</i>

240
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:50,997
RITZ:<i> Mynah Birds might have
worked if he hadn't been caught</i>

241
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:54,699
<i>by the Navy for going
AWOL and put into jail.</i>

242
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:58,771
I think he spent a month in brig,

243
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:00,706
then he got some type of discharge,

244
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:02,246
I don't think it was dishonorable, but

245
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:03,876
I don't think it was honorable either.

246
00:11:03,877 --> 00:11:06,479
And then, he was free,
he didn't have to hide no more.

247
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,014
And within a year's time,
he was signed at Motown,

248
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:10,415
and doin' his thing.

249
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,384
JUDGE: <i>He wrote and
produced records for acts</i>

250
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:14,919
<i>like The Miracles, and The Spinners.</i>

251
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,255
<i>He worked in Los Angeles
as a session musician</i>

252
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:19,257
<i>for Berry Gordy, playing bass.</i>

253
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:22,660
<i>And he watched Neil Young
become a rock star.</i>

254
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:24,229
Rick came from the '60s,

255
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,199
he's thinkin',
"I need to be a 'rock star, '

256
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,301
but I need to be a black rock star."

257
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:31,769
He's like, "You know what,
this needs to happen.

258
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,040
"There needs to be a black guy on
the same caliber as Mick Jagger,

259
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:36,941
<i>on the same caliber as Roger Daltrey,</i>

260
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:38,610
<i>on the same caliber as David Bowie.</i>

261
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:40,112
He needs to be like that.

262
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:42,214
JUDGE: <i>He was reportedly
considered to play bass</i>

263
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:44,448
<i>for Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young,</i>

264
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:48,819
<i>but lost the gig to a guy he
introduced to the group, Greg Reeves.</i>

265
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,389
After that, the whole thing implodes

266
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,557
and he winds up going back home.

267
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:55,559
One day I'm sittin' there,
me and my old lady,

268
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,994
<i>up in the crib on Utica St.,</i>

269
00:11:56,995 --> 00:11:58,396
<i>and all of a sudden,
somebody, you know,</i>

270
00:11:58,397 --> 00:11:59,897
<i>ringin' the doorbell. "Who the hell?"</i>

271
00:11:59,898 --> 00:12:01,832
<i>I look outside, and I see
a white Mercedes Benz.</i>

272
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,101
I said, "Who the hell do I
know that drives a Benz?"

273
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:05,269
<i>- So I go and see.</i>
- (BEEPS)

274
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,703
<i>And he said, "It's Jim."</i>

275
00:12:06,704 --> 00:12:08,839
'Cause that's what they
called him when we were kids.

276
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,474
- (DOOR BUZZES)
<i>- And I buzzed him upstairs.</i>

277
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,179
<i>Man, he came in,
and he, you know, had on</i>

278
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,582
beautiful fur coat and shit, hat
broke down, lookin' real nice.

279
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,817
And asked me,
"Did I still have my band?"

280
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:22,686
<i>And I said, "Yeah,
I still have a band."</i>

281
00:12:22,687 --> 00:12:24,555
He asked me what
was going on as far as music,

282
00:12:24,556 --> 00:12:27,824
so the first thing I played for him
was some classic funk, as it were.

283
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:30,761
<i>James Brown, you know, Bootsy
Collins, and Funkadelic</i>

284
00:12:30,762 --> 00:12:33,764
<i>And then Rick, "Stop." Said, "Man,
we can do better than that."</i>

285
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:35,566
<i>I said, "Shit, I'm down, then."</i>

286
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,935
And the rest is history, man,
we got together

287
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:39,335
and they kicked that ass.

288
00:12:39,336 --> 00:12:42,272
Quite well... quite well.

289
00:12:42,273 --> 00:12:45,742
JUDGE: <i>The Stone City Band
was led by Levi on keys,</i>

290
00:12:45,743 --> 00:12:47,778
<i>with a full rhythm section,
horn section,</i>

291
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:49,244
<i>and backup singers.</i>

292
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,314
<i>Over the years, the lineup
included Danny LeMelle,</i>

293
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:54,951
<i>William Rhinehart, Joanne McDuffie,</i>

294
00:12:54,952 --> 00:12:57,453
<i>Lanise Hughes and his brother Nate,</i>

295
00:12:57,454 --> 00:12:59,121
<i>among many, many others.</i>

296
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:03,559
Rick James, he started
his own term: punk-funk.

297
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,595
He was the king of punk-funk.

298
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:06,829
When we first came out,

299
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,831
New Wave was just ending,

300
00:13:08,832 --> 00:13:10,566
<i>punk music was just starting.</i>

301
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:14,937
Punk-funk was basically
just the rebellious part of punk

302
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:17,740
and then adding funk to that.

303
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:19,274
He started a movement.

304
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:24,113
The rebellious and danceable
music that's everyday life.

305
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:27,849
JUDGE: <i>The first album,</i> Come
Get It,<i> featured "Mary Jane,"</i>

306
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,252
<i>about a girl named Mary Jane</i>

307
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:33,322
<i>and how she was his "main thing."</i>

308
00:13:33,323 --> 00:13:36,191
We used to come up with
grooves at soundcheck,

309
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:38,560
and Rick would write to that stuff,

310
00:13:38,561 --> 00:13:40,996
and that's how most
of the songs came about.

311
00:13:40,997 --> 00:13:43,398
Simple but, uh, hummable.

312
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:46,668
And I used to tell guys,
you know, how important it was

313
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:48,403
that you play stuff that people,

314
00:13:48,404 --> 00:13:50,939
- when they're taking a shower, can hum.
- (HUMMING)

315
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,508
Daniel LeMelle, the saxophone player,

316
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:54,743
he used to playing all those
notes and all that extra shit.

317
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:56,612
Man, come one, that's jazz.

318
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:58,147
I call it "broke music."

319
00:13:58,148 --> 00:14:01,548
'Cause guys that did that shit
really didn't make any money.

320
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:04,185
So, fuck the "broke music" shit,

321
00:14:04,186 --> 00:14:05,887
play some shit that they can hum.

HUGHES: <i>It was really
a throw-away song.</i>

509
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,413
You know, it was just,
he needed one more song

510
00:21:56,414 --> 00:21:58,482
to throw on his album <i>Street Songs.</i>

511
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:03,220
I think in every musician's
career, there's a song

512
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,256
that they don't like, and to
them, it's a throw-away song.

513
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:08,825
And then, next thing you know,
it's the biggest thing ever.

514
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:10,927

We were kickin' that ass
out there, man.

519

Whoppin' that shit like it was right.

520
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,906
Well, about that time, Rick said,
"Hey, man, let's go to lunch."

521
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,575
I said, "Okay." We go to lunch.

522
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:28,044
<i>And we're sittin' there,

523
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:30,180
<i>And he called him "Ricky."</i>

524
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:31,848
And he sittin' down there, kickin' it.

525
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:34,750
<i>I'm sittin, "God, this is
fuckin' Neil Young.</i> (LAUGHS)

526
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:38,387
You know, one of the giants
of rock-dom, as it were.

527
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:40,556
<i>And they're kickin' it up,
laughin' about the old days.</i>

529
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:45,261
<i>And Rick was one of the
few people in Toronto</i>

530
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:47,729
<i>that told Neil, "Why don't you sing?"</i>

531
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,165
I wouldn't have done it.

532
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,800
I thought he had one of
the worst voices in the world,

533
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:54,303
but nobody else
can sound like Neil Young.

534
00:22:54,304 --> 00:22:58,073
And therein lies the fact
how he got so hugely successful.

535
00:22:58,074 --> 00:23:00,676
He always could write and play,

536
00:23:00,677 --> 00:23:02,377
but it was his sound.

537
00:23:02,712 --> 00:23:05,380
<i>We're sittin' there, and I'm
listening to these giants, man.</i>

538
00:23:05,381 --> 00:23:08,715
I remember Neil saying
how proud he was of Ricky.

539
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,654
<i>Because, "Man, you're doing it.
You're number one."</i>

540
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:15,690
It was beautiful, man.
Absolutely beautiful.

541
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:17,659
JUDGE: <i>It may have been beautiful,</i>

542
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,594
<i>but it was not enough for Rick James.</i>

543
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:21,929
I mean, he gave a two-hour
show every night,

544
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,398
and it was high energy.

545
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:25,567
<i>He was headlining, and he was, like,</i>

546
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:27,761
what the people had been waiting, four

547
00:23:27,762 --> 00:23:30,137
or five months, in
anticipation to see.

548
00:23:30,138 --> 00:23:31,806
He'd reached that echelon.

This was before MTV was playing
black music, let's put it that way.

553
00:23:40,882 --> 00:23:43,951
They may have been around, but
they weren't playing any of us.

554
00:23:43,952 --> 00:23:45,753

MTV not playing your material?

556

What's going on?

557
00:23:49,624 --> 00:23:53,427
I wish I could answer that.
I see all these acts...

558
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:55,362
some of them don't have record deals,

559
00:23:55,363 --> 00:23:57,865
some of them don't sell nine records.

560
00:23:57,866 --> 00:24:01,769
Then there's acts that sell millions
and millions of copies of records.

561
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,872
People want to see them,
and we're not seen.

562
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:06,974
Maybe it's the skin we're in.
