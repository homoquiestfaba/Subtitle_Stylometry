00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:10,636
You're crazy. He's too
big. You'll get murdered.

3
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,274
What's the fight about?

4
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:14,382
Fatso talks too much.

5
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,850
What did he say?

6
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:21,854
What did he say?

7
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:25,852
Is Benson the reason why you have
to go to the principal's office?

8
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:28,662
Guy, you in trouble again?

9
00:02:28,998 --> 00:02:30,989
You'll get clobbered.

10
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:33,334
He's got his Jap friends with him.

11
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:35,061
You want us to take them, Benson?

12
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,832
Nah. Leave them alone.

13
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:46,746
You stink.

14
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,384
- Blabbing to the cops.
- Me?

15
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:52,612
Me tell the law you're the jerk
that broke into the market...

16
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:54,882
...just to steal a few lousy potatoes?

17
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:58,050
Why, that kind of action ain't
worth talking to nobody about.

18
00:02:58,228 --> 00:02:59,320
Hey.

19
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:02,055
How'd it go in the principal's office?

20
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,298
Come on, grab him and get him!

21
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:07,436
Yeah, come on. Hit him in the face.

22
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:10,262
Hey, look. A fight.

23
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,068
- Hit him in the face.
- Get up, Guy.

24
00:03:15,745 --> 00:03:19,203
Hit him. Hit him.

25
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:22,476
- Cut it out.
- I ought to murder you, you fat stoolie.

26
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:25,519
What's the matter with you two
now? Go on, get out of here.

27
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:28,452
You and your Jap friends.

28
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,324
Beat it. All of you.

29
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:33,121
Why'd you let him get into this?

30
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,491
Me? I didn't do nothing.

31
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:37,656
I told him he'd get clobbered.

32
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,062
Go on home.

33
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:42,068
Holy cow. It wasn't my fault.

34
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:44,397
I'll see you at home. I want to talk to you.

35
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:46,974
There's nothing to talk about.

36
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,804
Look, wipe the blood off your face.

37
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,072
Come with me while I change my
clothes and I'll drive you home.

38
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:53,772
I don't want no drive home.

39
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,885
I'll give you a choice,
either home or juvenile hall.

40
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:59,851
I've seen juvenile hall
before. It don't scare me.

41
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:02,617
It's a good start on something
that can. San Quentin.

42
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:04,282
Now, come on.

43
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:06,828
Those your books?

44
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:10,996
Well, pick them up. They're city property.

45
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,634
Big deal.

46
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:14,736
I said, pick them up.

47
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:16,633
You can't tell me what to do.

48
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:18,535
Pick them up.

49
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,551
Thanks for the ride.

50
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:38,387
What's the trouble, Guy?
Fighting all the time.

51
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,392
And some worse things I've heard about.

52
00:04:40,563 --> 00:04:43,862
I don't care what you've heard.
I don't care what anybody's heard.

53
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,024
These are rough times for a lot of people.

54
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,602
Not enough jobs, people on relief.

55
00:04:48,771 --> 00:04:50,830
Everybody's got problems.

56
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,805
Is that why you broke
in the market last night?

57
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:57,343
Things so bad you have to steal?

58
00:04:57,513 --> 00:05:00,676
I didn't say I stole. Benson said it.

59
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:05,279
What are you doing?

60
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:07,946
I'm going in with you.
I've never met your folks.

61
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:10,615
I don't want you to go in.

62
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:12,951
I won't embarrass you.

63
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:15,723
I won't tell them anything
about that market. Come on.

64
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,366
You stay out of my house.

65
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:21,497
Please, please. Don't go in.

66
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:44,487
Where's your mother?

67
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,820
In the hospital.

68
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:47,860
How long has she been there?

69
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:50,659
They took her away last Wednesday.

70
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,964
And your father?

71
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:57,797
I got no father. He's dead.

72
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,970
You living here all alone?

73
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,504
I can take care of myself. I do all right.

74
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:07,547
Come on.

75
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:10,413
You come with me.

76
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:12,511
You can't go on living this way.

77
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:15,486
Roaming around loose, stealing your food.

78
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:17,683
It's no good, Guy.

79
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:22,562
Go pack some clothes. You'll bunk
up with George for a few days.

80
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,665
I'm not taking anything from anybody.

81
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:29,271
You won't be taking anything from my
family they don't want to give you.

82
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:32,564
Now, come on, pack some clothes.

83
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:47,322
- Hi.
- Hi.

84
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,253
Guy's mother's in the county hospital.

85
00:06:49,425 --> 00:06:53,486
- He'll stay with us until she gets well.
- Say, that's great.

86
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,124
- Can he sleep in my room?
- That's the idea.

87
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,063
Hey, we'll have a ball.

88
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,429
Except...

89
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,764
I'm real sorry about your mother.

90
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,738
Come on.

91
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:15,213
See you in a minute, Guy.

92
00:07:27,396 --> 00:07:28,761
Mama?

93
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:47,782
You have come here well.

94
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,587
My mother means you're welcome.

95
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:56,353
Yes. Welcome.

96
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:57,993
Thank you, Mrs. Une.

97
00:07:58,161 --> 00:07:59,890
our parents don't speak much English.

98
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,121
You'll have to start learning Japanese, Guy.

99
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:05,096
Heck, I'm just barely getting
by in 7th grade English.

100
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:08,294
Hey, come on, Guy. I'll show you our room.

101
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,415
Hey, hurry up. The breakfast is ready.

102
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,356
oh, is that what she said?

103
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,860
She said "good morning" to you.

104
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:37,791
What do you usually have for breakfast?

105
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:43,164
Raw fish and rice.

106
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:44,966
Chilled pigeon eggs.

107
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:47,231
Raw?

108
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,208
Yesterday it was octopus.

109
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,941
If we're lucky, there'll be some left.

110
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,142
Delicious.

111
00:08:57,486 --> 00:09:00,683
Especially with that
sauce made from fish eyes.

112
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,956
Fish eyes?

113
00:09:26,882 --> 00:09:28,645
What did you think we eat around here?

114
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,548
Even if Papa and Mama aren't
citizens, Kaz and I are.

115
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:33,416
We're Americans. All of us.

116
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:36,251
Yeah, not as dumb as me.

117
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:43,730
<i>oh, sugar is osato.</i>

118
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:52,874
Make you all-America boy.

119
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:07,646
Already all-America boy.

120
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:10,018
No need cereal.

121
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:14,185
oh, tell your Mom I didn't mean that.
I like this kind of cereal best of all.

122
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:27,332
Pop says he hopes you slept okay.

123
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,273
oh, yes, sir. Just fine.

124
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:46,661
<i>Automobile is jidousha?</i>

125
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,456
Is that for taxi too?

126
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:51,532
<i>- No, taxi is taxi.
- Taxi.</i>

127
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:55,030
What'd you say?

128
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:59,231
<i>That means you're doing very
well. You're joto... okay.</i>

129
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,840
okay. I like that.

130
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:17,254
<i>Broom is hoki.</i>

131
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,361
A vacuum cleaner would be easier and better.

132
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:23,426
This is a carpet sweeper.

133
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:28,036
I know what it is in Japanese.
you say it in English.

134
00:11:28,204 --> 00:11:29,637
Carpet sweeper.

135
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:32,467
Carpet-a sweeper.

136
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:34,006
Yes, that's good.

137
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:36,974
<i>Now, if we had a motor... Motah.</i>

138
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:38,943
It would be a vacuum cleaner.

139
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:43,150
vacu-um clean?

140
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,946
Er... vacuum cleaner.

141
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,579
Er? vacu-um cleaner.

142
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:50,783
Yes.

143
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:53,354
Now... This is...

144
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,929
<i>In Japanese it's a hoki...</i>

145
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:58,464
...but in English it's a broom.

146
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,896
A broom.

147
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:03,163
- Yes.
- You teach me.

148
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:08,336
<i>That's a mado but in English it's a window.</i>

149
00:12:08,511 --> 00:12:10,604
Window.

150
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,811
Yes. Why didn't you ever help
your mother learn English?

151
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,747
Gosh, I don't know.

152
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,151
This is a broom.

153
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,155
oh, boy, you teach me.

154
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:29,120
George, the work's all done.
How about some basketball?

155
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:30,287
Sure. Let's go.

156
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:14,401
His mother?

157
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,601
She's... She's dying.

158
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,884
Can this be his home?

159
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:32,226
Yes, his home.

160
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:01,089
Come here.

161
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,522
I tell you a story.

162
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,224
very old.

163
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,157
It is...

164
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,765
An ancient legend.

165
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:18,772
All Japanese boy know.

166
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,569
You learn too now.

167
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:25,202
once upon a time...

168
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:29,613
...old woman go to river to wash clothes.

169
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:34,119
In river large peach come floating.

170
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,923
old woman take peach home...

171
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:46,124
...and peach open up in two pieces.

172
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:50,864
<i>out jump kawaii boy.</i>

173
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,338
Beautiful boy.

174
00:14:56,545 --> 00:15:01,482
old woman and husband name him Peach Boy.

175
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:04,081
Peach Boy.

176
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:09,124
Soon, Peach Boy grow big and strong.

177
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,315
He want to go...

178
00:15:14,063 --> 00:15:16,122
He wants to conquer Devil's Island.

179
00:15:16,298 --> 00:15:18,061
Is there really such a place?

180
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:19,996
So the legend goes.

181
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,003
Soon...

182
00:15:23,906 --> 00:15:26,466
...boy go to onigashima.

183
00:15:26,642 --> 00:15:32,342
And he see big chief and fight.

184
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,811
And kill him.

185
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,713
They very scared. Give up.

186
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:43,552
And then Peach Boy bring
all treasure back home.

187
00:15:43,726 --> 00:15:49,255
Make old woman and old man very happy.

188
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:52,823
What was that treasure
that made them so happy?

189
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:01,164
Love.

190
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:04,172
Yes, love.

191
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:09,873
I do love you, Mama-san.
I love you very much.

192
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:18,058
I've listened to that Peach Boy
story a hundred times before...

193
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:21,924
...and never knew what
the treasure really was.

194
00:16:22,831 --> 00:16:25,925
Because, my brother, you've always had it.

195
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:32,534
Come on.

196
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,373
Come on.

197
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:37,569
Hey, George.

198
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,271
- Hey, George.
- Coming.

199
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:43,418
Like, this thing's still loose.
Take it to the filling station...

200
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,450
...to let Mike fix it.

201
00:16:45,821 --> 00:16:47,686
Why aren't you dressed? You'll be late.

202
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:49,721
Well, we'll skip coffee if we have to.

203
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:52,156
You told me this is a very important morning.

204
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:53,954
It is.

205
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:56,256
But darn it, Guy. I'm afraid she'll say no.

206
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,229
oh, are you nuts?

207
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,892
All you have to do is take a look
at her and it tells the whole story.

208
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:03,333
I wish I were that sure.

209
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:05,803
Well, all you're gonna do
is ask her to go steady.

210
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:07,373
But I can't get the words out.

211
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:10,510
I've tried a hundred times. The
words just stick in my throat.

212
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:11,839
Do me a favor?

213
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:15,142
Sure, I will. What do you want me
to do? Take the car to Mike's...

214
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:19,151
No. You take Ester to coffee and church.
Find out how I really stand, will you?

215
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:24,521
Well, now, I just not might come back.
I might take her to the preacher myself.

216
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:26,888
- Thanks, pal.
- okay, here.

217
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,256
I'll wrap some wire around while you change.

218
00:17:29,431 --> 00:17:30,557
Yeah.

219
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:32,358
Take a shave while you're at it.

220
00:17:32,534 --> 00:17:36,937
<i>oh, yeah. Gee, I can't go to bat for
my brother looking like a nukka, can I?</i>

221
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,249
So that's why I came to pick
you up instead of George.

222
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:50,248
He hasn't got a headache.

223
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:52,018
And you want my answer?

224
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:53,484
Yeah.

225
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,488
George is a big boy. Why
can't he speak for himself?

226
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:00,389
oh, well, you know George. He's shy and he...

227
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:04,464
oh, maybe you'll have a change of
mind when I ask you in church, huh?

228
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:07,158
- Hey, how about a little
breakfast? oh, fine.

229
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,860
Anything you want up to 40 cents.

230
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:12,396
You're really a big spender, aren't you?

231
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:16,010
Well, that date of mine last
night cleaned me out, you know.

232
00:18:16,745 --> 00:18:17,769
So suffer.

233
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:20,710
That's what you get for going
out with girls like that.

234
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:25,217
Well, now that's a fine way for my
future sister-in-law to talk to me.

235
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,320
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we
interrupt this program...</i>

236
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:31,823
<i>...to bring you a special news bulletin.</i>

237
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:34,690
Yeah, that's me honking. How
about a little service, huh?

238
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,661
<i>The Japanese have attacked
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, by air...</i>

239
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,567
Hey, Jap lover.

240
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:43,705
How's it feel being out with the enemy?

241
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:45,432
Are you talking to us?

242
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:46,801
Come on. Leave them alone.

243
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:49,273
What do you mean, leave
them alone? That's a Jap.

244
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:52,880
Hey, punk. What are you
doing out with a Jap broad?

245
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,812
Well, well, now just a minute.

246
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:59,579
No, no, no, Guy. Don't. Please.
Let's just go someplace else.

247
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:04,153
Johnny, now, knock it off, will you?
Wait a minute, Johnny, wait a minute.

248
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,530
oh, please.

249
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:21,608
- Come on, now. Take it easy, will you?
- What do you mean, take it easy?

250
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:24,769
- What do you expect after what's happened?
- That's what I mean.

251
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:28,212
- Making cracks at that girl for no reason.
-  Wait, listen to this.

252
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:32,717
<i>At least 2000 Americans have been
killed by Japan's sneak attack.</i>

253
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:34,321
<i>The great fear of the moment...</i>

254
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:37,219
<i>...is that more Jap bombers
may be even now on their way.</i>

255
00:19:37,392 --> 00:19:40,589
If you got any sense, get that girl
off the street and out of sight.

256
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,390
<i>From what meager information
we've been able to get...</i>

257
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:44,827
<i>...from radio reports...</i>

258
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,491
<i>...extensive damage has
been wrought on Hickam Field.</i>

259
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:51,503
<i>No matter how long it may take us...</i>

260
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:55,700
<i>...to overcome this premeditated invasion...</i>

261
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:58,574
<i>...the American people in
their righteous might...</i>

262
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:03,581
<i>...will win through to absolute victory.</i>

263
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:14,086
<i>I ask...</i>

264
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:17,096
<i>...that the congress declare...</i>

265
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:20,565
<i>...that since the unprovoked...</i>

266
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:22,465
<i>...and dastardly attack...</i>

267
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:25,167
<i>...by Japan...</i>

268
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,841
<i>...on Sunday, December 7th...</i>

269
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:31,002
<i>...1941...</i>

270
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:34,208
<i>...a state of war...</i>

271
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:37,079
<i>...has existed...</i>

272
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:39,447
<i>...between the United States...</i>

273
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:42,749
<i>...and the Japanese empire.</i>

274
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:08,708
We're at war for sure, men.
What should we do about it?

275
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:10,977
We ought to join the army as fast as we can.

276
00:21:11,153 --> 00:21:12,586
Are you guys crazy?

277
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:14,483
Crazy? Didn't you hear the president?

278
00:21:14,656 --> 00:21:16,521
Well, sure I heard him. So what?

279
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,092
Enlisting is nuts. We'd
be fighting our own people.

280
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:20,523
They're not our kind.

281
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,530
They might be coming here to L.A. next.
Sneak up on us, just like at Pearl Harbor.

282
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,760
- Freddy, where's the closest place to join?
- Fort MacArthur.

283
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,337
- Let's get going before the war's over.
- Yeah.

284
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:34,765
Coming with us, Guy?

285
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:38,435
You don't think I'm gonna let
you go by yourselves, do you?

286
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:41,343
- Never passed up a good fight yet.
- George...

287
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:43,245
...do you know what you're doing?

288
00:21:43,418 --> 00:21:45,386
She's asking if we know what we're doing.

289
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,885
Do we know what we're doing?

290
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,023
Have the coffee ready when we get back.

291
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:50,920
Yeah, we might be back in uniform.

292
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:53,323
- Come on, Kaz, let's take off.
- Where you going?

293
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:56,692
- We're going to Fort MacArthur to join up.
- You're wasting your time.

294
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,460
What do you mean?

295
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:01,466
I was there yesterday. I tried
to enlist and they laughed at me.

296
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:03,399
You'd think we're spies or something.

297
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,631
They don't want any of us.

298
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:08,776
They might accept Guy, but not you two.

299
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:15,347
Well, if they don't want my
brothers, than the hell with them.

300
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:37,667
I don't care what you say, it
stinks. The whole thing stinks.

301
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,366
oh, Guy, please don't. Don't blame
them. They're only following orders.

302
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:43,738
They haven't told you
where they're taking you?

303
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:46,745
To Santa Anita, the assembly center.

304
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:50,510
- Then a relocation camp.
- No. Concentration camp is what you mean.

305
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:53,950
Whatever or wherever it is
we'll all be the same there.

306
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,181
And if they throw rocks in our window...

307
00:22:56,358 --> 00:22:59,384
...or scream dirty names it
won't be because we're Japanese.

308
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:02,860
You're not, you're Americans.
That's what I'm talking about.

309
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:05,192
other Americans don't seem to think so.

310
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,232
Ester.

311
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:10,768
Goodbye, Guy.

312
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,295
Goodbye, Ester.

313
00:23:15,544 --> 00:23:18,513
I don't want us to be lost, separated.

314
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,046
We may be sent to different camps.

315
00:23:22,551 --> 00:23:24,883
We'll find each other.

316
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,015
We'll write.

317
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:44,867
- Here we come.
- okay.

318
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,769
There we are.

319
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,046
We look like those refugees
in the newsreel, huh?

320
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:58,078
Well, so long, Guy.

321
00:23:58,253 --> 00:23:59,277
I'll be seeing you.

322
00:23:59,454 --> 00:24:00,716
In a couple of weeks or so.

323
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:03,414
It's been good bunking
with you. You know that.

324
00:24:03,592 --> 00:24:05,287
I know. Stay on the beam, buddy.

325
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,155
okay. You too.

326
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:11,827
Well, this is it, Guy.

327
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,298
Hey, Kaz, let me ask you something.

328
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:17,666
The wheels running this war
gotta needle everybody...

329
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,467
...who once maybe came from someplace else.

330
00:24:20,642 --> 00:24:24,703
Now, how about all the Germans,
all the Italians in America too?

331
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,948
I can't answer that, Guy.

332
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:30,278
Right or wrong, our government's
doing what they think is right.

333
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:32,682
No one bats a thousand.

334
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,419
Well, good luck, kid.

335
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:36,614
Good luck to you, Kaz.

336
00:24:43,865 --> 00:24:45,890
oh, I carry it.

337
00:24:51,306 --> 00:24:53,740
I will miss my home.

338
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,309
I'll miss it too, Mama-san.

339
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:04,209
All-America boy, you good son to me.

340
00:25:04,686 --> 00:25:10,488
oh, Mama-san, how can I ever thank
you for all you've done for me?

341
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:13,628
Sayonara, my son.

342
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:26,138
Sayonara.

343
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,580
Sorry, son. You've got a perforated eardrum.

344
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:46,906
<i>Dear buddy, by the time you read this...</i>

345
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,609
<i>...Kaz and I will be on our
way to Fort Meade and overseas.</i>

346
00:27:50,785 --> 00:27:54,380
<i>Address, A.P.O. 449, New York.</i>

347
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:57,957
<i>Kaz and I spent a couple of days
with the folks before being shipped.</i>

348
00:27:58,126 --> 00:28:00,924
<i>They miss you very much, Guy.
Because of Pop's health...</i>

349
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,554
<i>...the authorities are transferring
them to Camp Manzanar, in California.</i>

350
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:06,394
<i>Everybody's on the move, huh?</i>

351
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:07,830
<i>You better write, you bum.</i>

352
00:28:08,002 --> 00:28:10,197
<i>We want to hear that
everything's okay with you.</i>

353
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:12,465
<i>Your brother, George.</i>

354
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,632
<i>P.S. Phoned Ester to say goodbye.</i>

355
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:20,338
<i>I started to propose to her
over the phone but got cold feet.</i>

356
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,069
Son Guy!

357
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:51,940
oh, Mama-san.

358
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,515
oh, and I'm sure glad to be here.

359
00:28:56,684 --> 00:28:59,050
You look wonderful, Mama-san. Wonderful.

360
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,347
How is Papa? Is the
California sun helping him?

361
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:02,854
oh, help much.

362
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:06,050
He work in field now. Soon be here.

363
00:29:06,227 --> 00:29:08,695
- Did you see camp?
- Yeah, a little bit of it.

364
00:29:08,863 --> 00:29:10,763
What I saw looked better than I expected.

365
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:12,331
Not so nice at first.

366
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,195
All dirt and mud.

367
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:16,599
No flowers.

368
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:21,102
We worried about you.

369
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:23,206
Not hear from you.

370
00:29:23,378 --> 00:29:26,506
We wait and wait. For letter.

371
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,343
- For visit.
- Yeah. I...

372
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,543
Well, you know, I was traveling
around here and there and...

373
00:29:33,588 --> 00:29:36,853
Well, now that you're a
lot closer, why, it's...

374
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:39,521
Hey.

375
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,719
Are these two heroes anybody I know?

376
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:44,023
oh, they fight in Italy now.

377
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:47,999
<i>But daijobu last we hear.</i>

378
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:51,869
I wish to God it was over so they'd be safe.

379
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:57,275
Son Guy safe?

380
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,475
oh, sure.

381
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:01,842
Sure, I'm safe.

382
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:03,847
You must miss them awful much, Mama-san.

383
00:30:04,018 --> 00:30:05,952
oh, heart cries at night.

384
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,749
But must be. To straighten out this mess.

385
00:30:09,924 --> 00:30:12,950
Son George teach that word. It's good word?

386
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:15,254
That's a real good word.

387
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,193
oh, it sure is a mess.

388
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:18,354
Sons.

389
00:30:18,533 --> 00:30:24,028
All-America boys end
mess. No more mess ever.

390
00:30:24,205 --> 00:30:25,263
We live happy.

391
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,498
Happy?

392
00:30:26,708 --> 00:30:30,109
How can you be happy? Everything you
and Papa-san ever worked for is gone.

393
00:30:31,145 --> 00:30:33,045
True. Gone.

394
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:41,819
once before we sit so.

395
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,323
Yeah, I know. It was a
long time ago, wasn't it?

396
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,584
Mother...

397
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:52,927
...father of Une family work hard all lives.

398
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,797
Want to build...

399
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,000
Good...

400
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:00,435
- Good...
- Foundation?

401
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,802
<i>oh, hai, hai.</i>

402
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:03,409
Good foundation.

403
00:31:03,578 --> 00:31:05,307
For future.

404
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,780
Not many years left for
old people to build again.

405
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,714
Sons must build.

406
00:31:11,886 --> 00:31:15,253
Kaz, George, Guy.

407
00:31:15,423 --> 00:31:17,448
Must build home again.

408
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,093
Must build world again.

409
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:22,627
Must end mess.

410
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:27,057
All papa-sans,
mama-sans...

411
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:32,764
...all countries, all over the world is same.

412
00:31:33,708 --> 00:31:35,437
This you believe?

413
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,979
What difference does it make
what one man believes or does?

414
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,713
one man must believe.

415
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,482
Must make difference.

416
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:55,789
Why else Kaz, George go
far away across ocean...

417
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:59,866
...to kill men look like brother they love?

418
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,797
Mama-san...

419
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:08,836
...are you saying that it's all right
for me to go to war against the Japanese?

420
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:21,682
oh, you big fellow.

421
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,381
- oh, not so big, Pop.
- Guy, what you do all this time?

422
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,891
No, never mind about me.
I want to know about you.

423
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:29,427
- How do you feel? You look great.
- I feeling great.

424
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:30,996
- Eat like horse.
- Horse?

425
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:33,759
oh, got plenty of hay around here, huh?

426
00:32:33,935 --> 00:32:36,165
Horse, hay.

427
00:32:36,337 --> 00:32:38,897
Mama-san eat a whole... Whole...

428
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:42,338
- Bale?
- So, so. Bale.

429
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:45,870
- What was that?
- Meal time.

430
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,345
Gong on every block hit same time.

431
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:50,916
Eating very punctual.

432
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:53,019
- Punctual.
- Punctual.

433
00:32:53,187 --> 00:32:54,814
George teach. Good word?

434
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:56,320
oh, that's a great word.

435
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:59,289
Come, we eat three bales hay.

436
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,553
Three bales.

437
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:06,557
- Captain.
- Yes.

438
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,929
There's a man outside,
says he wants to enlist.

439
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:11,162
But he's been turned down by his own board.

440
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:12,499
What's he doing here?

441
00:33:12,674 --> 00:33:15,768
Well, he says he speaks
and understands Japanese.

442
00:33:15,943 --> 00:33:17,535
Send him in. We need interpreters.

443
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:19,339
Yes, sir.

444
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:27,753
The captain will see you now.

445
00:33:29,957 --> 00:33:32,824
Captain Salter, Mr. Gabaldon.

446
00:33:33,461 --> 00:33:35,952
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

447
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:55,206
Go left. Go left.

448
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:58,251
Right, back, ho!

449
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:01,380
Go left. Go left.

450
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:04,323
Step to the rear, ho!

451
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:08,056
Go left.

452
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,622
Go left, right, left.

453
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,502
Don't that joker know any
orders besides that one?

454
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:23,234
Left. Halt.

455
00:34:24,178 --> 00:34:25,975
To the rear. Halt.

456
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:28,742
Left oblique, halt.

457
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:31,111
Halt. Halt.

458
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:33,150
order. Halt.

459
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,851
All right, let's fall in there on the double.

460
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:41,353
Move it. Gabaldon, front and center.

461
00:34:41,696 --> 00:34:43,687
Gabaldon!

462
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:51,361
Now, can't you get it through
your head what oblique means?

463
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:53,530
- Now, look, sarge...
- You're at attention.

464
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,801
I came into this outfit to talk to
the enemy, not to footrace with them.

465
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,575
Now, let's go through it once more, boot.

466
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,241
In the Marines, it's
"sergeant," not "sarge. "

467
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,410
It is never sarge, you got it?

468
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:10,250
In the marines you
fight. F-I-G-H-T.

469
00:35:10,424 --> 00:35:13,757
I don't care if you're a cook
or a typist or an interpreter.

470
00:35:13,928 --> 00:35:17,261
I don't care if you got a busted back
or a busted eardrum. You'll fight.

471
00:35:17,431 --> 00:35:18,591
Take my word for it.

472
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:21,530
Do I make myself clear?

473
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:24,236
Yes, sir.

474
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:25,663
Fall in!

475
00:35:33,815 --> 00:35:35,578
Left.

476
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:41,180
These things don't weigh very much, do they?

477
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:44,847
You just kind of take it and throw it
like a football, put it on the target.

478
00:35:45,026 --> 00:35:46,118
Right, isn't it, sarge?

479
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:54,195
That's not bad, Gabaldon.
That's not bad at all.

480
00:35:54,368 --> 00:35:57,804
But next time pull the pin.
The idea is to kill the Japs.

481
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:00,797
Next man.

482
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:03,209
What's the matter with you?

483
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:13,153
There will be times when you'll find
that your hands are your only weapons.

484
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:17,647
Now, if I can have a volunteer, I'll
demonstrate the first jujitsu holds.

485
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:20,350
Is he gonna be surprised.

486
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:26,463
This is the first basic position.

487
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,012
And now for the second position.

488
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:56,759
Well, I guess I really
asked for that one, didn't I?

489
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:01,330
Hey, you want to try for the third position?

490
00:37:07,508 --> 00:37:11,035
I don't know, I just don't know.
Three days and I get no place.

491
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:13,840
This filly won't post without
a slip from the preacher.

492
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:17,507
I tell this babe I'm being shipped
overseas just so I'll make out.

493
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:21,246
Didn't expect orders to break
camp for us the minute we get back.

494
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:23,185
How'd you do, Mac?

495
00:37:23,524 --> 00:37:26,152
oh, mission accomplished.

496
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,658
Did you do all right, hero?

497
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:29,227
Are you kidding?

498
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:30,864
Got a different one every night.

499
00:37:31,032 --> 00:37:35,799
It's a good thing the corps keep me in
shape or I'd be up for another Purple Heart.

500
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,336
Next time, buddy, I'm
taking my liberty with you.

501
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,167
Well, that's the way it goes.

502
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,206
Some guys got it.

503
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:44,071
Some guys ain't.

504
00:37:44,245 --> 00:37:46,179
All right, saddle up, move out of here.

505
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,780
Anybody know where we're going?

506
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:50,076
Scuttlebutt has it
Hawaii. We're replacements.

507
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:52,651
- What for?
- You'll find out when the ship hits port.

508
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,879
Ship? I get seasick taking a bath.

509
00:37:55,056 --> 00:37:59,959
Come on, let's move, let's get out
of here. Come on, let's go. Move it.

510
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:11,466
Intelligence Section,
2nd Marines, 2nd Division.

511
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,333
Is that a good outfit to be with?

512
00:38:13,507 --> 00:38:15,600
The 2nd is one of the "bleedingest. "

513
00:38:15,776 --> 00:38:17,437
Hey, Bill, is that your old outfit?

514
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:19,772
Yeah, right from the beginning.

515
00:38:20,114 --> 00:38:24,141
- You mean the "Canal" beginning?
- Yeah. Guadalcanal until I got it on Tarawa.

516
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:26,013
Where'd you get it, Pete?

517
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:30,624
Some eager boot like you thought I was
a Jap and stuck his bayonet into me.

518
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:33,419
oh, that is sort of a running gag, Guy.

519
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:37,223
Actually, junior here got it
from a sniper on New Britain.

520
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,026
Where that hit, I don't
think it'll ever stop itching.

521
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:41,293
Where did it hit?

522
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:45,701
Where the hell do you think you
gotta get hit for a Purple Heart?

523
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,836
Well, I'm glad at least
I belong to something...

524
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:52,468
...even if it is an outfit
with a couple of tin heroes.

525
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,920
Hey, I didn't know they had
obstacle courses in the trucks.

526
00:39:18,205 --> 00:39:19,536
This is it, you five.

527
00:39:19,707 --> 00:39:23,575
Hey, are you sure this is the right
place? This looks like a beach club to me.

528
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:25,177
It's a club, all right.

529
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:26,404
very exclusive.

530
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,141
The members have fought in action
in every island of the Pacific, Boot.

531
00:39:31,218 --> 00:39:32,913
Come on, let's go.

532
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,033
That must be our replacements.

533
00:39:52,206 --> 00:39:54,470
They're fresh. Wonder if
they're seasoned, Lenny.

534
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,269
Two old men and three boots.

535
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,444
Kind of hard to know who
to salute around here.

536
00:40:01,615 --> 00:40:03,708
You can forget about that. I'm Sgt. Leonard.

537
00:40:03,884 --> 00:40:05,181
Private Gabaldon.

538
00:40:05,352 --> 00:40:07,616
Don't get the wrong idea about that either.

539
00:40:07,788 --> 00:40:09,085
We earn our pay.

540
00:40:09,256 --> 00:40:11,451
Come on, I'll take you to the skipper.

541
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:19,696
You can leave your gear outside, men.

542
00:40:26,474 --> 00:40:28,738
Replacements are here, sir.

543
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:31,469
Good. Bring them in, sergeant.

544
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:40,853
Sergeant Hazen reporting as ordered, sir.

545
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,386
Corporal Lewis reporting, sir.

546
00:40:42,556 --> 00:40:44,615
Private Gabaldon reporting as ordered, sir.

547
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,760
Sir, Private Polaski reporting as ordered.

548
00:40:46,927 --> 00:40:49,452
Sir, Private Martini
reporting as ordered, sir.

549
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,257
Stand at ease.

550
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:53,793
Glad to have you aboard, men.

551
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,637
Welcome back to the 2nd Division, Hazen.

552
00:40:57,805 --> 00:41:01,400
- How was the vacation?
- Things got a little too quiet for me, sir.

553
00:41:01,575 --> 00:41:02,667
I'm glad to be back.

554
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:08,544
Lewis? How's it going? Says
here you were shot in the ashcan?

555
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,084
Not bad, sir. Could have
been with a howitzer.

556
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:16,923
Gabaldon. Speak Japanese, eh?

557
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,688
I get only part of that, but
my Japanese is just so-so.

558
00:41:22,863 --> 00:41:26,560
- Where'd you learn the language?
- Well, I learned it from my family...

559
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,565
...and neighbors when I was growing up.

560
00:41:30,504 --> 00:41:35,032
Polaski, Martini. Fine boot records,
men. I need all the good men I can get.

561
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:38,076
Well, now, officially we're part
of Regimental Headquarters...

562
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,679
...R2 on the organization charts.

563
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:45,109
But in action, we're so far out in front
we don't have contact with headquarters.

564
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,744
Now...

565
00:41:49,657 --> 00:41:52,057
...I make it loud and clear
that I've got the best...

566
00:41:52,226 --> 00:41:55,684
...and toughest collection of
specialists in the whole corps.

567
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,463
Now, you make sure you don't
let anybody think differently.

568
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:03,000
Sergeant Leonard will fix
you up with 48 hours liberty.

569
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,728
Enjoy yourselves, men.

570
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:06,497
It might be your last time ashore.

571
00:42:09,076 --> 00:42:11,101
- That'll be all, sir?
- Yeah, carry on.

572
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,870
Aye, aye, sir.

573
00:42:23,224 --> 00:42:26,216
What a dirty slop joint that was.
It's worse than the last three.

574
00:42:26,393 --> 00:42:28,486
Charge you a buck a
drink and nothing happens.

575
00:42:28,662 --> 00:42:31,790
- I don't think they put booze in it.
- Say we get a bottle someplace.

576
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,231
Where are the dames? There's got
to be three broads in this town.

577
00:42:35,402 --> 00:42:37,063
- Here chick, chick.
- Are you kidding?

578
00:42:37,238 --> 00:42:40,264
There's 10 guys for every dame in Honolulu.

579
00:42:42,743 --> 00:42:45,507
Now there's a gal who hopes
the war will never end.

580
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:46,907
You know those swabbies.

581
00:42:47,081 --> 00:42:50,278
They'll kiss a snake if
somebody'll hold it for them.

582
00:42:54,521 --> 00:42:56,648
That's what old daddy's been looking for.

583
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,351
- oh, shake it baby, shake it.
- visit a Genuine Authentic Hawaiian village.

584
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:03,462
- That bus doesn't leave for a couple hours.
- Let's take a taxi.

585
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:06,099
Yeah, let's take a taxi,
there's one right there.

586
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:08,132
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

587
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:10,463
I'll go make a deal with him.

588
00:43:10,704 --> 00:43:13,832
okay, all you pretty little
babies, get your grass skirts on.

589
00:43:19,413 --> 00:43:23,076
Hey, buddy, you want to take us to that
"Genuine Hawaiian village" over there?

590
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,615
Sure, Mac.

591
00:43:24,985 --> 00:43:27,317
Where can I get some whiskey, good whiskey?

592
00:43:27,488 --> 00:43:29,581
Whiskey's hard to come by.

593
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:38,727
That's a brand new. 45. I stole
it off the base this morning.

594
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:40,332
Interested?

595
00:43:40,501 --> 00:43:41,866
You can get plenty for it.

596
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,631
Now it's still got the Cosmoline
and wax paper wrapped around it.

597
00:43:45,806 --> 00:43:48,832
I'll trade it for three
quarts, and I mean good, now...

598
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:51,500
...three quarts of good whiskey.

599
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,237
okay?

600
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:57,442
only don't tell them guys
because they're square.

601
00:43:59,086 --> 00:44:00,519
Hey.

602
00:44:02,923 --> 00:44:04,720
Be my guests.

603
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,572
Hey...

604
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,574
You mean, this is the Hawaiian village?

605
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:28,681
Yeah. Look, you wait up there
and I'll see what I can do.

606
00:44:29,116 --> 00:44:31,141
You mean, this is the place?

607
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:33,115
What about with the hula dolls?

608
00:44:33,287 --> 00:44:36,450
Where are the broads with Hawaiian
skirts shaking their gazoombas?

609
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:38,784
Hey, we've been took.

610
00:44:39,526 --> 00:44:42,495
- Hey, what's with the boot?
- Watch your language.

611
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:44,255
What's with the bright boot?

612
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,238
Bonded. Just like the officer's Club's.

613
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:54,340
Where's the pistol?

614
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:57,568
All right, you're both under
arrest. I warned you about this.

615
00:44:57,745 --> 00:45:00,077
- CID, Criminal Investigating Division.
- But look...

616
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:01,771
We finally caught you, huh, Mac?

617
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,974
You're trading booze for government property.

618
00:45:04,151 --> 00:45:05,243
I didn't steal nothing.

619
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:06,943
You know what we do to runners?

620
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,022
They get years and years, that's
if we don't shoot them first.

621
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,091
- This kind of guy we hang.
- I've got a wife and kids.

622
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,956
We got the information you're
the top guy in this outfit...

623
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,360
...that's been receiving
this stolen property.

624
00:45:18,532 --> 00:45:22,024
No, I just drive a cab. Tell him.
Tell him it was your idea. Tell him.

625
00:45:22,202 --> 00:45:25,797
Let him go. He don't know nothing about
it. You got me. What more do you want?

626
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,998
Well...

627
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,435
...all right. I gotta keep this as evidence.

628
00:45:31,345 --> 00:45:34,212
- Please let me go.
- All right, get out of here.

629
00:45:41,455 --> 00:45:44,322
Look at all the beautiful booze.

630
00:45:44,525 --> 00:45:46,755
You know, buddy, not only
are you a good buddy...

631
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:51,523
...you're also an A-number one con man.
That's a very rare and valuable combination.

632
00:45:51,698 --> 00:45:53,495
And now...

633
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,794
...for the broad department.

634
00:46:10,217 --> 00:46:12,310
Permit me. Thank you.

635
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,148
- Beachhead established, sir.
- My toast, sir.

636
00:46:16,323 --> 00:46:19,486
Well, here's looking at...

637
00:46:20,227 --> 00:46:21,785
At...

638
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,625
Hello, there, Madame Butterfly.

639
00:46:25,799 --> 00:46:28,359
How would you like to...

640
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,798
Sorry, no speak English.

641
00:46:45,085 --> 00:46:47,246
- Don't let her get away.
- You talk her language.

642
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:48,786
See if she talks ours.

643
00:46:48,956 --> 00:46:51,754
If he can handle the dames
like he can get the liquor...

644
00:46:51,925 --> 00:46:53,756
...we're going to have a ball.

645
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:01,129
Yeah, the Iron Petticoat.

646
00:47:10,177 --> 00:47:12,042
Do you know her?

647
00:47:12,212 --> 00:47:15,739
Yeah, I know her. Half the
guys on the island know her.

648
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:19,750
Well, listen, I'm just passing through,
but how about a little introduction, huh?

649
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,185
Pete, do you remember the football
game we played with Navy back in...

650
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:26,554
- Don't change the subject, just introduce...
- Not changing the subject.

651
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:28,558
What was the score?

652
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:33,165
- Nothing to nothing. There was no score.
- That is my point.

653
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:36,063
She's a writer for a
magazine back in the States.

654
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:42,141
She writes about how everyone should
give their all to the servicemen.

655
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:45,904
She just doesn't practice
what she preaches, that's all.

656
00:47:50,317 --> 00:47:51,841
- What a waste.
- Yeah, forget it.

657
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:55,887
Half the guys got Purple Hearts from
bumping against the old Iron Petticoat.

658
00:47:56,056 --> 00:47:59,685
Maybe it's time for her to get a
Purple Heart. How about introducing me?

659
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,419
What do you say? Introduce me, come on.

660
00:48:02,596 --> 00:48:06,259
No deal. I'm not wasting a good
liberty on operation Petticoat.

661
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:07,661
Get her for me.

662
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:12,271
old dad's got a technique that'll cut that
iron like it was tissue paper. Come on.

663
00:48:12,439 --> 00:48:14,703
Please. For your buddy.

664
00:48:16,543 --> 00:48:18,477
okay, buddy, I'll see what I can do.

665
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,636
Go, man.

666
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:24,443
For the last time, will you please
keep your clammy hands to yourself?

667
00:48:24,618 --> 00:48:27,951
- Baby, just one little...
- Hi.

668
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,012
Sheila.

669
00:48:30,757 --> 00:48:32,748
My name's Bill Hazen.

670
00:48:32,926 --> 00:48:36,293
You did a story on me about a
year ago and then we went dancing.

671
00:48:36,463 --> 00:48:39,455
And if I know our Sheila, that's all you did.

672
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,158
oh, yes, of course. How are you?

673
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,325
Just fine.

674
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:47,439
okay, Marine, I suppose you're
gonna try to steal my date.

675
00:48:47,608 --> 00:48:49,576
Ignore him, sergeant. He's drunk.

676
00:48:49,743 --> 00:48:52,007
Well, I'm not gonna let you.

677
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:54,010
Look, mister.

678
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,843
I'm going to give her to you as a gift.

679
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,612
- You can't treat me as if I were...
- Temper.

680
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:04,783
What a horrible thing to do
to one of our fighting men.

681
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:07,188
Iron Petticoat.

682
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,889
I'm so ashamed.

683
00:49:18,672 --> 00:49:20,663
- Drink?
- Yes.

684
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:24,103
Honey!

685
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:41,757
So, what we plan to do is, when you get
off work, then it'll be about a half hour...

686
00:49:45,532 --> 00:49:46,829
That's my buddy.

687
00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:54,671
What have you been doing, Sheila?

688
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:58,538
oh, a great many things. But I'm
leaving shortly for Australia.

689
00:49:58,712 --> 00:50:02,739
Australia. Well, that's... That's nice.

690
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,724
That's very nice.

691
00:50:29,142 --> 00:50:31,269
What did you guys ever do before I enlisted?

692
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,276
Listen, tell me, what's up?

693
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:37,247
She gets off in a half an hour, and you
and Bill are gonna flip for the roommate.

694
00:50:37,417 --> 00:50:38,679
- She got a roommate?
- Yeah.

695
00:50:38,852 --> 00:50:39,944
oh, great.

696
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,021
- Well, what's with the roommate?
- Well, sounds great.

697
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:46,250
She's a dancer from San Francisco.
They've got their own apartment.

698
00:50:46,426 --> 00:50:48,986
- They've got their apartment?
- We'll meet them there.

699
00:50:49,162 --> 00:50:51,995
We don't have to flip. Look,
Bill's got his own date.

700
00:50:55,435 --> 00:50:58,529
I'll tell you what, you go tell
him that you and I are cutting out.

701
00:50:58,705 --> 00:51:01,765
No, you go tell him because Sono
told me where to get some booze.

702
00:51:01,942 --> 00:51:04,775
It looks like we're gonna
really need it. See you later.

703
00:51:04,945 --> 00:51:06,640
See you later.

704
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:14,280
Hey, Pete. Pete, this is Sheila Lincoln.

705
00:51:14,454 --> 00:51:16,149
- Sheila, this is Pete Lewis.
- Hi.

706
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:19,053
- You've heard me speak of Sheila.
- I sure have.

707
00:51:19,226 --> 00:51:23,185
Yeah, well, Sheila's magazine
is sending her to Australia.

708
00:51:23,396 --> 00:51:27,765
Well, that's if I can get a seat on the
plane. I have a very low priority though.

709
00:51:27,934 --> 00:51:30,903
- oh, I wouldn't say that.
- What he means to say is he's been...

710
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:33,835
...dying to meet you, haven't you?
- oh, yeah.

711
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:37,067
I'm sorry I can't stay and chat
with you. Guy and I have a date...

712
00:51:37,244 --> 00:51:40,270
...with a couple of Japanese
chicks, huh? I'll see you later.

713
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,578
We're going over to their apartment.

714
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,810
- Well, I'll see you later, Bill.
- Yeah, Pete, stay a while.

715
00:51:46,987 --> 00:51:47,976
Look, Sheila...

716
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:52,054
...why don't we go along? Be a lot
more fun than a bar or restaurant.

717
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:54,318
What kind of fun can
you have in an apartment?

718
00:51:56,062 --> 00:51:57,893
She serious?

719
00:51:58,431 --> 00:51:59,796
Look at it this way, Sheila.

720
00:51:59,966 --> 00:52:03,163
You can get a lot of local color
for your magazine, isn't that right?

721
00:52:03,336 --> 00:52:04,769
oh, yeah, yeah.

722
00:52:04,938 --> 00:52:07,429
Yeah, I can see it now. A
Sheila Lincoln exclusive:

723
00:52:07,607 --> 00:52:10,872
"I Saw our Fighting Men in Action. "

724
00:52:13,513 --> 00:52:14,639
No?

725
00:52:42,676 --> 00:52:46,043
Hey, Pete, will you turn around?
I can look at yours any day.

726
00:52:46,213 --> 00:52:47,737
Don't you think of anything else?

727
00:52:48,782 --> 00:52:50,215
Not lately, honey.

728
00:52:50,784 --> 00:52:52,945
Hey, Sono, you don't
have to wait on us, honey.

729
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,451
I'm not. I just want
everybody to have a good time.

730
00:52:55,622 --> 00:52:58,056
- okay, honey.
- "Honey. "

731
00:52:58,625 --> 00:53:00,923
Everybody is "honey" to you.

732
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,359
oh, go, girls, go, go, go.

733
00:53:04,898 --> 00:53:07,924
Don't you men realize all
a girl wants is respect?

734
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:12,037
Well, excuse me, ma'am.

735
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:15,903
Hey, go, Pete. Go.

736
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:18,402
Hey, honey, go, go.

737
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,244
Hey, that's it, Pete. Go, honey.

738
00:53:26,353 --> 00:53:28,947
Never run out of ice as
long as that dame's around.

739
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,350
oh, you're mean.

740
00:53:30,523 --> 00:53:33,083
I don't get it. She's got
all the standard equipment...

741
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:36,024
...she's got the extras. Comes
off the line without a motor.

742
00:53:36,196 --> 00:53:37,185
She's got the motor.

743
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:40,994
The man with the right
key hasn't shown up yet.

744
00:53:43,403 --> 00:53:44,427
I wouldn't mind.

745
00:53:45,272 --> 00:53:47,399
Yeah, baby!

746
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:49,932
You'd leave little old Sono?

747
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:55,013
oh, no, I wouldn't leave little old Sono.
I wouldn't want hara-kiri on my conscience.

748
00:53:55,181 --> 00:53:56,478
Don't flatter yourself.

749
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,880
After all the trays I've carried tonight.

750
00:53:59,052 --> 00:54:01,179
I want somebody as tired as me.

751
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,294
Like that one.

752
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:09,655
Let's go, soldier.

753
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,093
oh, I've had it, honey.

754
00:54:12,265 --> 00:54:15,428
What's the matter, Pete? Did you run out of:

755
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,564
I don't know, I don't know, honey.

756
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:21,468
If I've got anything left I'm gonna
save it for something important. okay?

757
00:54:21,641 --> 00:54:23,268
Let's catch our breath, huh?

758
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,269
You catch your breath.

759
00:54:25,445 --> 00:54:27,879
I ain't quitting while I'm ahead.

760
00:54:31,284 --> 00:54:32,308
Go, baby.

761
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,885
Hey, let's go, Famika. Go, honey.

762
00:54:35,055 --> 00:54:36,989
oh, yeah.

763
00:54:38,425 --> 00:54:41,758
Now, that's what we're really
fighting for. Not Ma's apple pie.

764
00:54:41,928 --> 00:54:44,522
- Hey, she's the greatest, right, Gabby?
- Great.

765
00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:49,466
She should be. She was the
best stripper in San Francisco.

766
00:54:49,636 --> 00:54:51,103
No kidding.

767
00:54:51,271 --> 00:54:52,966
Stripper?

768
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,930
Hey, Peter.

769
00:54:55,108 --> 00:54:56,837
Famika is a stripper.

770
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:58,841
- What?
- Famika's a stripper.

771
00:54:59,012 --> 00:55:00,707
- A stripper?
- Yeah.

772
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,246
- For real, baby?
- Are you impressed?

773
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,908
I sure am, honey.

774
00:55:06,086 --> 00:55:07,917
I'm glad.

775
00:55:08,088 --> 00:55:11,580
Hey, Famika, honey, come on, come
on, let's have a little show, huh?

776
00:55:11,758 --> 00:55:16,457
Down, boy. It's my night off. Besides,
it might offend your lady friend.

777
00:55:16,629 --> 00:55:17,687
Who? Sheila?

778
00:55:17,864 --> 00:55:20,856
oh, Sheila wouldn't mind.
You wouldn't mind, would you?

779
00:55:21,034 --> 00:55:23,195
of course you wouldn't, I knew you wouldn't.

780
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:24,665
We're gonna have a strip...

781
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:28,239
You'll never attract a stripper
that way. Here, let me show you.

782
00:55:29,275 --> 00:55:32,642
And now, folks, may I present
the Queen of Burlesque:

783
00:55:32,812 --> 00:55:34,370
Famika!

784
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:37,015
Famika's going to shake it
from the tips of her toes...

785
00:55:37,183 --> 00:55:38,980
...to the tops of her tiny tassels.

786
00:55:39,152 --> 00:55:42,246
Hey move it, honey. Move it for me.

787
00:55:42,789 --> 00:55:44,620
Come on, Famika.

788
00:55:44,791 --> 00:55:46,520
Fire one.

789
00:55:56,736 --> 00:55:58,101
Come on, shake it, shake it.

790
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:00,739
Come on, Famika, move it.

791
00:56:00,907 --> 00:56:01,931
Go, baby.

792
00:56:03,843 --> 00:56:05,435
Now, that is not a boy.

793
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,376
Hey, go, Famika, go.

794
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,682
Attababy.

795
00:56:12,085 --> 00:56:13,552
Go, baby, go.

796
00:56:15,422 --> 00:56:17,481
Go, honey.

797
00:56:18,491 --> 00:56:22,018
- Now, that's what I call art.
- I've seen better.

798
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:24,959
Well, evidently you've been
around a lot more than we have.

799
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:28,225
If anybody asks you, I went thataway.

800
00:56:32,205 --> 00:56:35,766
Hey, how about that? I've got a
front row seat and I'm not even bald.

801
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:39,168
You gotta change your seat, buddy.
Your girl's getting lonesome.

802
00:56:39,345 --> 00:56:41,006
Your girl's getting lonesome.

803
00:56:41,181 --> 00:56:43,649
That's my girl. The one
over there catching cold.

804
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,547
Now, buddy, you're forgetting. I remember:

805
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:50,746
"Get her for me, buddy. I'll cut
through that like tissue paper. "

806
00:56:50,924 --> 00:56:52,858
- I was only kidding.
- Yeah, well, I'm not.

807
00:56:53,026 --> 00:56:56,621
So if you wanna be a buddy-buddy.

808
00:56:56,796 --> 00:56:59,424
Change your seat, buddy.

809
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:00,998
Come on, honey, go.

810
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,634
Go.

811
00:57:03,136 --> 00:57:04,797
Go.

812
00:57:04,971 --> 00:57:08,202
Let's go, Famika, come on, honey.

813
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:10,942
Go, honey.

814
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:14,812
Hey, that's it, baby, come on, honey.

815
00:57:19,819 --> 00:57:21,286
Go.

816
00:57:22,322 --> 00:57:24,654
Hey, come on, honey.

817
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,806
Hey.

818
00:57:51,351 --> 00:57:52,943
Easy, boy, you'll break our lease.

819
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,054
You're breaking my heart, honey.
Come on, take off a little more.

820
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,713
You're cute, honey, but the show is over.

821
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,382
Come on, honey, come over here.

822
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,831
Well, did you like the show?

823
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,332
You call that a show?

824
00:58:09,936 --> 00:58:11,597
Well, yeah.

825
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,700
Come here.

826
00:58:19,312 --> 00:58:21,507
Come here, honey.

827
00:58:25,118 --> 00:58:27,916
Put on the record.

828
00:59:29,616 --> 00:59:33,950
- Not bad for a girl without a motor.
- Yeah.

829
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:23,395
Hey, Marine.

830
01:00:23,569 --> 01:00:27,335
Your mouth is open. It's watering too.

831
01:00:27,507 --> 01:00:28,633
Yeah.

832
01:00:28,808 --> 01:00:31,242
Want some advice from an old campaigner?

833
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:33,174
Deal the cards.

834
01:00:33,479 --> 01:00:34,468
oh, you're kidding.

835
01:00:35,148 --> 01:00:36,137
You want that?

836
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,587
Then turn around and deal.

837
01:00:42,755 --> 01:00:45,781
She can have anyone she wants,
so she doesn't want them.

838
01:00:45,958 --> 01:00:47,983
Show her someone she can't have.

839
01:00:48,161 --> 01:00:49,526
Deal.

840
01:00:53,866 --> 01:00:55,299
Come on.

841
01:01:28,901 --> 01:01:29,925
She's coming.

842
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:33,004
- Ignore her.
- I'll try.

843
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:39,607
What's the matter? Too
much for you, baby boy?

844
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:42,740
- Whose play?
- Yours.

845
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:45,710
Nobody turns their back on Sheila.

846
01:01:45,885 --> 01:01:49,343
Why don't you go back and
finish your minuet? I'm busy.

847
01:01:56,229 --> 01:01:58,493
What a waste of good whiskey.

848
01:02:00,767 --> 01:02:02,530
Why, you dirty...

849
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:07,362
Come on, Guy. Come on, Guy.

850
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:11,007
- Hey, go, Marine.
- Yeah, come on.

851
01:02:14,113 --> 01:02:15,944
Hey, come on.

852
01:02:16,115 --> 01:02:17,980
Come on, Guy. Pin her down.

853
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:22,346
Pin her down. Now you got her.

854
01:02:57,123 --> 01:02:58,283
But...

855
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,358
She... She's...

856
01:03:05,965 --> 01:03:08,160
Don't you think it's a little warm in here?

857
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:13,864
Yeah, well, I think it's
a little warm in here.

858
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,418
Two down and one to go.

859
01:03:39,198 --> 01:03:40,187
Gin rummy?

860
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:41,894
Gin rummy?

861
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:45,162
- While those guys are...
- There's a time and place for everything.

862
01:03:45,338 --> 01:03:48,796
You're right. We've got the
time and this must be the place.

863
01:03:48,975 --> 01:03:50,943
The time, yes.

864
01:03:53,045 --> 01:03:54,774
Gin rummy.

865
01:03:56,282 --> 01:03:58,716
At least let's make it interesting.

866
01:03:58,951 --> 01:03:59,975
What'll we play for?

867
01:04:04,156 --> 01:04:06,351
I wish I was smart enough to cheat.

868
01:04:06,526 --> 01:04:07,584
Don't worry.

869
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,159
I'm always unlucky.

870
01:04:09,328 --> 01:04:13,196
Well, we're still dancing.
Don't you ever change the music?

871
01:04:14,567 --> 01:04:17,764
Music. Great bunch of Marines. oh, boy.

872
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:19,871
Three gorgeous chicks and what do you got?

873
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:22,530
one guy's dancing, other
guy's playing gin rummy...

874
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:25,142
...and the other guy's
out there picking flowers.

875
01:04:25,478 --> 01:04:27,207
oh, yes. Some picking, huh?

876
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:29,143
Hey, they got the right idea.

877
01:04:29,315 --> 01:04:32,011
oh, They sure have. Well, let's go back.

878
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,685
Sono.

879
01:04:43,729 --> 01:04:46,061
- Guess what?
- What?

880
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:51,792
Gin.

881
01:04:53,272 --> 01:04:54,739
I told you I was unlucky.

882
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:14,399
Still leave the dirty work for
the slobs on the ground, huh?

883
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,498
You're hit?

884
01:08:19,612 --> 01:08:21,239
What's the matter?

885
01:08:25,451 --> 01:08:27,681
Who you feeling sorry
for, your Jap friends...

886
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:30,185
...or your buddies out
there getting slaughtered?

887
01:08:32,925 --> 01:08:36,486
Look, boot, you're not the first one
that ever cracked up hitting the beach.

888
01:08:36,662 --> 01:08:38,960
Damn it, we're all scared.

889
01:09:17,736 --> 01:09:19,203
We need a satchel charge.

890
01:09:19,371 --> 01:09:23,068
- Gotta get close enough to use it first.
- That gun's gotta be knocked out.

891
01:09:32,284 --> 01:09:33,649
It's you and me, Lewis.

892
01:09:33,819 --> 01:09:35,514
Cover us.

893
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,468
Right flank.

894
01:10:01,647 --> 01:10:03,239
What are you doing here, Gabaldon?

895
01:10:08,554 --> 01:10:09,543
Gabaldon!

896
01:10:16,829 --> 01:10:18,421
Go.

897
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,182
Scratch one pillbox.

898
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:55,583
They understood you just fine, Marine.

899
01:11:58,330 --> 01:12:01,265
Go. Go.

900
01:12:20,449 --> 01:12:22,212
Hey, I'm...

901
01:12:23,218 --> 01:12:25,846
- I'm sure sorry about what happened.
- Forget it.

902
01:12:26,021 --> 01:12:28,080
You can fight on my team any day.

903
01:12:28,257 --> 01:12:31,556
I... You know... Sounds crazy, but
I don't know what happened to me. I...

904
01:12:31,727 --> 01:12:34,195
You had a problem to solve, that's all.

905
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:38,290
Yeah, but I'm not sure it's solved yet.

906
01:12:38,467 --> 01:12:40,628
My folks were...

907
01:12:43,372 --> 01:12:45,499
Well, it's kill or be killed, I guess, huh?

908
01:12:46,074 --> 01:12:49,737
Kill or be killed, that's all you
have to remember. Just don't forget it.

909
01:12:50,212 --> 01:12:52,806
Your turn to play spy, Gabby.

910
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:57,246
Looks like we're gonna
have a rough night tonight.

911
01:12:58,387 --> 01:13:02,346
oh, Sono, why did I leave you in Honolulu?

912
01:13:23,645 --> 01:13:25,476
oh, yeah.

913
01:13:30,352 --> 01:13:32,252
Yeah, I see something.

914
01:13:32,421 --> 01:13:34,912
Please, not while I'm eating.

915
01:13:41,029 --> 01:13:42,360
<i>Nellie Bly. Go ahead.</i>

916
01:13:42,531 --> 01:13:45,762
Pass the word to the skipper.
Here they come. Two tanks...

917
01:13:45,934 --> 01:13:48,027
<i>...about half the Japanese army.</i>

918
01:13:48,203 --> 01:13:50,535
Sir, two tanks moving
in on Hill 3-6-8.

919
01:13:50,706 --> 01:13:52,833
Notify Black Jack Six. We're moving out.

920
01:13:53,008 --> 01:13:54,532
We're moving out. on the double.

921
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:55,734
Black Jack?

922
01:13:55,911 --> 01:13:57,173
Give me Black Jack Six.

923
01:13:57,346 --> 01:13:59,906
All right, get the lead out of your pockets.

924
01:14:04,353 --> 01:14:06,150
Man, they're really whooping it up.

925
01:14:19,902 --> 01:14:22,370
Looks like they're loaded on sake.

926
01:14:23,372 --> 01:14:24,805
Banzai attack for sure.

927
01:14:24,973 --> 01:14:26,600
Yeah.

928
01:14:27,209 --> 01:14:28,506
How we gonna see them?

929
01:14:29,305 --> 01:14:35,292
