1
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:54,653
- Happy birthday to me!
- Happy birthday!

2
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,060
Oh, that's actually
a really good one.

3
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,297
- Wait. Anybody want this?
- Oh, my god.

4
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,506
That's what happens
when you do a mercy invite.

5
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,642
I believed you wanted
to invite everyone.

6
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,110
Dad, I can't invite

7
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:20,312
everyone in my art class
except for one person

8
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,014
without social networking
evidence

9
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:24,149
inflicting more pain on
that person than was intended.

10
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,651
And I'm not a monster.

11
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:27,719
I'm proud of you. I think.

12
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,222
She gets detention a lot,

13
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,891
and she yells at teachers
sometimes.

14
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,626
Then there was that rumor
that went around

15
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,295
that she just kept
running away from home.

16
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,297
Um, maybe she can Uber.

17
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,165
I seriously believe
that we can go home now.

18
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,167
Um, did I mistakenly convey
this was a democracy?

19
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:45,871
We are not going
till she gets picked up.

20
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:50,142
Uh, the car broke down.

21
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:52,144
I'm just gonna take the bus.

22
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,379
You're not taking a bus.
I'll drive you home.

23
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,248
Claire has almost saved
her half of the money

24
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,983
she needs for a car.
Isn't that right?

25
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,985
And this will be
one of the few times left

26
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,353
I can drive you guys around.

27
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:02,688
Huh?

28
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,223
Uh, I'm...

29
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,891
Claire:
You won't be able to

30
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,527
hear my dad tell jokes
that only he thinks are funny

31
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,263
for an entire car ride
unless you come.

32
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,498
You don't really want
to miss that.

33
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,541
Claire: Wow. I got more gifts
than I thought I did.

34
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,678
- Can I put this in here?
- Uh, yeah, I'll get it.

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,213
Thank you, Marcia.

36
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,455
Claire:
Maybe he just is into...

37
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,952
Claire: Maybe he's just content
where he... where he is.

38
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:43,128
Hey.

39
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,997
Can I help you?

40
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,566
Claire: What?

41
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,800
Marcia:
If this is the one,

42
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,269
he's so... he's really funny.

43
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:52,271
- He does these weekly videos.
- This is...

44
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,974
See? It's so random.

45
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,076
It's so weird.

46
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,546
Claire:
Yeah, you have a crush on him.

47
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,248
- I don't get it. Yeah, go back.
- Pause it.

48
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,083
- Why don't you get it?
- I just don't get it.

49
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:06,418
Marcia: It's, like,
he's blond, and he's cute.

50
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,986
Claire: No, his eyebrows
are just like...

51
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,888
Uh, shut up. His eyebrows?

52
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,256
- Yeah. -That's the one thing
you couldn't get?

53
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,924
Yeah.

54
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,726
- I get turned on by eyebrows,
though. -

55
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,428
Marcia: Oh, okay.

56
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,563
That's pretty good.

57
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:22,134
- Claire: Oh, my god.
- Marcia: What? What?

58
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,569
Marcia: Oh. You see
what he does, though?

59
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,805
- How does he even do that?
- I don't know.

60
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,473
That's the whole point
why I'm showing you.

61
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,676
Marcia:
It's so genius.

62
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,611
So bad.

63
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,856
Claire:
Hey.

64
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,425
Pardon me, sir.

65
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,493
I think you have the wrong car.

66
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,324
Claire:
We woke up in here.

67
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,934
Claire:
What the hell is going on?

68
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,803
What are we doing here?

69
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,771
What happened to my dad?

70
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,840
He's out there.

71
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,545
Do you know
what happened to my dad?

72
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,334
I choose you first.

73
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,842
It's only gonna be a minute.

74
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,583
Pee on yourself.

75
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:06,351
- Pee on yourself.
- No!

76
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:08,086
No, no!

77
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,166
Claire:
No. No!

78
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,302
No!

79
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,640
Claire:
Open the door!

80
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,857
Are you okay?

81
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,861
Marcia:
He wanted me to dance for him.

82
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,502
Marcia:
Okay.

83
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,838
The outside door is locked.

84
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,076
Everything's okay.

85
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,813
We're okay.

86
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,150
We're okay.

87
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,960
Man: <i>I hear
the tiniest little splash,</i>

88
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,461
and here it comes.

89
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:26,131
A freak of nature, like this.

90
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,433
So, he comes across the stream,

91
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:33,271
and he's so tall that the water
doesn't even get to his belly.

92
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,306
Then he stops.

93
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,376
And my heart's coming out
of my chest.

94
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,379
You got buck fever.

95
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:44,349
Uncle John's got buck fever.

96
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,284
That's not true, Casey.
Your daddy's a liar.

97
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,553
- How big was the rack?
- It was huge.

98
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,622
Where are you supposed to look
when you shoot, Casey?

99
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:53,024
- At the body. -Then why was
he looking at the rack?

100
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,360
'Cause he had buck fever.

101
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,163
She'll say anything you say.

102
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,631
You gonna do that when you get

103
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,466
your mentored hunting license
in three years?

104
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,068
No, sir.

105
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,870
Make sure you put your
gloves on after you finish.

106
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,273
Your feet and your hands
get cold first out there.

107
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,203
Three students abducted.

108
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,738
The father of one
of the students

109
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,339
woke up dazed
in king of Prussia,

110
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,707
reportedly drugged.

111
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,909
He found the kids
and the car missing.

112
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,578
Neighbors are in disbelief.

113
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,580
A normally quiet community

114
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:51,950
Is reeling after this abduction.

115
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,451
If you have any information

116
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:55,086
concerning the whereabouts
of these girls,

117
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,756
you are urged
to contact the police.

118
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,975
Marcia: It doesn't matter
if you open that door, Claire.

119
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:19,477
There's a second locked door.

120
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,313
Claire: Okay. He's gonna come
in here again any second,

121
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:25,316
and we're not letting him take
one of us out again.

122
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,753
We just... we just cried
and screamed,

123
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,421
and we didn't hurt him

124
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,091
because we were afraid
to get him upset.

125
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:35,460
God, that's victim shit.
Jesus.

126
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:38,296
We should fight him.

127
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,832
We should drop
a crazy-ass bomb on him.

128
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,568
I saw him carry one of you
and lay you on the bed

129
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,004
like you weighed nothing.

130
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:49,174
One punch from him
would knock one of us out.

131
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,777
I took... I took six months
of Kenpo karate class,

132
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,846
and you distract
the assailant with pain.

133
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:58,783
Everything is so easy
for you guys.

134
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,753
You do one thing,
you can predict the next thing.

135
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,424
It's not the way it's gonna be
in this situation.

136
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,426
Claire:
We're not getting out of here.

137
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:09,661
You're saying that you're not

138
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:12,463
gonna fight
with everything in you?

139
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:16,467
You know the only chance...
The only chance we have

140
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,370
is if all three of us
go crazy on this guy.

141
00:12:21,473 --> 00:12:23,241
We have to hurry.

142
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,613
Marcia:
We need you, Casey.

143
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,015
Claire is smart.

144
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:33,785
Let's listen to her.

145
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,721
I'll do it
if you're gonna do it, too.

146
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:40,291
We can win.

147
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,627
He'll hurt us.

148
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,964
No. Shut up.

149
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,132
Both of you.

150
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,201
Claire: You're gonna pick
your miserable self up

151
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,370
and help us get out of here.

152
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,740
Blow me.

153
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,809
And your six months of karate

154
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,978
at the king of Prussia mall
can blow me, too.

155
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,313
No. No, no,
you-you can't do this today.

156
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,848
You can't do this right now.

157
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,850
Why do you do this?
Why do you act like this?

158
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,452
Why do you act
like you're not one of us?

159
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,527
When you're aiming, Casey,

160
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,529
always keep both eyes open.

161
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,365
Cover your target
with the barrel,

162
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:24,569
then move with it
to get its pace.

163
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,205
I'm warning you, it's gonna be
frustrating the first times.

164
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,707
You're gonna shoot
under it or behind it.

165
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,843
You'll learn to stay with it.

166
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:35,179
Females are smarter
than the males,

167
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,681
but you know that...
It's like humans.

168
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,752
Females use their nose
to stay alive.

169
00:13:40,754 --> 00:13:42,520
They make sure they have cover.

170
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:46,457
They always remember
they're trying to stay alive.

171
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,360
Bucks go off by themselves.

172
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:52,263
Bucks get dumb
during mating season.

173
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,565
Boys make too much noise.

174
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,968
Yes, they do.

175
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,203
I'm better than a boy, right?

176
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:01,906
Yes, you are.

177
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,508
John:
Hey.

178
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,517
I'll let you know when I hear
something that makes sense.

179
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,855
We don't even know
what this is yet.

180
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,532
Hey.
I, uh... I was inspired.

181
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:32,670
N-n-n-no, that one.

182
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,273
That one, before the pink
frock coat with the thorns.

183
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,775
That's supposed to be like a...
Like a tailored jacket,

184
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:40,678
but I'm gonna hand-print it
with newspaper headlines.

185
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,817
Woman: Well, I'm a simple
blouse-and-skirt person,

186
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:48,987
but these...

187
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:52,156
These are very artistic, Barry.

188
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,292
Just the kind of thing
Hamptons ladies

189
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:58,963
would spend $15,000 on
to wear once at a charity ball.

190
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,665
Shut up.

191
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,200
You know,
I-i can't stay too long.

192
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:05,003
This is... this is just a...
Just a visit.

193
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,505
Well, tell me what's going on.

194
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,208
What, you-you mean the e-mail?

195
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,809
Ah, just the usual things.

196
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,177
Just feelings
of being overwhelmed.

197
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,946
Well, the terseness
of your e-mail

198
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:17,482
made it sound specific
and time-related.

199
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,283
Are... are you looking
for something?

200
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,318
No.

201
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,319
- No?
- No, I'm just...

202
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,653
Just admiring.

203
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,622
- I'm better now.
- How's work?

204
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,790
It's great.

205
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,825
Well, when I last spoke to them,

206
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:30,495
they believed
you were a model employee.

207
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:34,465
They found you meticulous
and conscientious.

208
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:35,967
- You know this, right?
- I do.

209
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,002
Well, you've managed there
for ten years.

210
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:41,305
You're functioning very well,
Barry.

211
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,542
And it's a rare and wonderful
place for you to work.

212
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,244
Yes, it is.

213
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:49,080
You know, of all my other
clients with your disorder,

214
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:51,949
you've been the most consistent
at your job.

215
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:55,586
Did something happen, Barry?

216
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,589
How old are you?

217
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:02,060
Psh... just, the Internet
is inconsistent on this point.

218
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,995
Why is that on your mind?

219
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:08,032
Who's gonna look after us
when you retire or pass on?

220
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,368
Y-you know, we're gonna have
to take care of ourselves,

221
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,570
and nobody even believes
that we exist.

222
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,239
If ever something
were to happen to me,

223
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,508
I've made arrangements
with a colleague from Baltimore

224
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,776
to take over.

225
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,845
Hmm.

226
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:24,215
Hey, you, uh... you live alone?

227
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,516
You know this.

228
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,552
I'm sorry,
I just meant... how long?

229
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:30,154
Always.

230
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,825
That must be so lonely.

231
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,099
Uh, you know what?

232
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,767
I'm...

233
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,102
I'm doing much better.

234
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,436
I-I shouldn't have
e-mailed you.

235
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,038
I'm-I'm just...
Look at me.

236
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,439
I'm too impulsive.

237
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,046
By the way,
is anybody listening?

238
00:16:55,048 --> 00:16:56,781
Does anybody care about us?

239
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:58,049
Yes.

240
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,884
The university of Paris
has asked me

241
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,486
to do a lecture, in fact.

242
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,622
I'm going to be doing it
via Skype from right here.

243
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:07,959
People are believing more.

244
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,462
Let's meet at our usual time
next week.

245
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,731
I would rather
you didn't leave, Barry.

246
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,301
Did something happen?

247
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,336
Don't worry.

248
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,770
This was just a visit.

249
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,305
I'm doing much better.
I actually...

250
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:24,008
Don't you want
your sketches, Barry?

251
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,411
You're usually
very protective of them.

252
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,280
Yeah.

253
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:32,183
Thanks.

254
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:37,622
Uh... I'll see you next week
at our usual time.

255
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:40,458
Thanks for fighting for us,
Dr. Fletcher.

256
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,106
- Thanks, Dr. Fletcher.
- Welcome.

257
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:56,641
I just think I'm gonna blow it.

258
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:57,942
No, you'll be great.

259
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,110
I'll see you next week.

260
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,845
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay.

261
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,952
Man:
In DJ's exclusive

262
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,954
million-dollar
holiday bucks bonanza.

263
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,692
I don't know how you work
with those people.

264
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,662
- Hmm? What people?
- Your patients.

265
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:23,134
Oh, you can't use your thumbs
to spin the wheel, dumbasses.

266
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,902
They always use their thumbs.

267
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,371
Oh.

268
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:30,474
W-well, we look at people
who've been shattered

269
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,811
and different as less than.

270
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,913
What if...

271
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:38,749
They're more than us?

272
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,251
What?

273
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:44,255
Do you believe them?

274
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,923
Your patients.

275
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,192
You know,
just between you and me.

276
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,760
Yes, I do.

277
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:50,895
Hmm.

278
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,130
Flick it. Flick it.

279
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,501
I don't believe it.

280
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,070
- No? No.
- No offense.

281
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,571
Woman:
But when you call,

282
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:01,939
- we'll send you a second
easyfeet... -

283
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,541
absolutely free.

284
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,042
- Just pay separate processing.
- Oh.

285
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,344
So that's two easyfeet...

286
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,179
Now, that...
I need to buy that.

287
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,614
This young offer won't last...

288
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,417
Claire:
He's back.

289
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,419
Marcia:
There's a lady outside.

290
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:27,398
Woman:
Dennis, admit what you've done.

291
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,799
Dennis:
Don't get upset.

292
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,136
Woman:
Don't tell me.

293
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,171
I'm getting frightened.

294
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,476
I thought that you
had this under control.

295
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,711
Please tell me
it's not too late.

296
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,179
Dennis:
The food is waiting.

297
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,653
Woman:
Is she in that room?

298
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:52,056
- We're here!
- Help us!

299
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,724
- Marcia: We're in here!
- Woman: Dennis, what is this?

300
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,226
- How many are there?
- Dennis: N-n-no...

301
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:57,228
Don't go in there.
Don't go in there.

302
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:08,873
Don't worry.

303
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,344
I'll talk to him.

304
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:16,047
He listens to me.

305
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,791
He's not well.

306
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,993
He knows what you're here for.

307
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31,595
He's not allowed to touch you.

308
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,364
He knows that.

309
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:36,701
Uh-uh.

310
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,937
Hmm?

311
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,029
Man:
<i>Karen.</i>

312
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,197
Dr. Fletcher:
<i>Joe.</i>

313
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:07,665
Joe:
<i>They said you can't have</i>

314
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,034
<i>your own panel
at the national conference.</i>

315
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,003
<i>They conceded, however,</i>

316
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,639
<i>that you can be part
of the mood disorder panel.</i>

317
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,842
Dr. Fletcher:
<i>It's not a mood disorder.</i>

318
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:20,478
Joe: <i>Oh, I'm aware
of your beliefs, Karen.</i>

319
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,314
Well, were they open this time
with the new evidence?

320
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:26,684
Joe: <i>One of your arguments
is a dog?</i>

321
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:29,320
You submitted video
of a dog acting differently

322
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:31,255
to one of your patients
at different times?

323
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:32,990
It is more dramatic than that.

324
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,860
<i>They are what
they believe they are.</i>

325
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:38,896
<i>The brain has learned
to defend itself.</i>

326
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:41,065
Joe: <i>You speak of them like
they're supernaturally gifted.</i>

327
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,667
Like... like they have
powers or something.

328
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,503
Karen, these are patients.

329
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,438
<i>They have been through trauma.</i>

330
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,645
And perhaps now, they are
capable of something we're not.

331
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,083
<i>We have brain scans now.</i>

332
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:03,087
<i>D.I.D. Patients have changed
their body chemistry</i>

333
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,022
<i>with their thoughts.</i>

334
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,927
He's just trying to scare us.

335
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:14,265
He was having a full
conversation with himself.

336
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:17,601
What was that line about...
"the food is waiting"?

337
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,236
Does everyone get
how wacked this is

338
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,305
and that we need to get
out of here now?

339
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,650
You... no.

340
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:35,386
Please keep your area neat.

341
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:37,054
The bathroom, it's unacceptable.

342
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,557
To make it easy,
I've color-coded these.

343
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,792
Use the blue bottle
f-for the floor

344
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:45,930
and the pink bottle
for the ceramic surfaces.

345
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,235
Uh...

346
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:11,856
Patricia has reminded me that...

347
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,758
I was sent to get you
for a reason.

348
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,661
That you are sacred food.

349
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,233
And I promise
not to bother you again.

350
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:37,448
Maybe he has a dog or something.

351
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,284
Think he's gonna feed us
to his dogs?

352
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,386
Claire:
<i>Casey.</i>

353
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,556
Casey!

354
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,375
My name's Hedwig.

355
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,344
I have red socks.

356
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,920
He's on the move.

357
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:53,190
What?

358
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,463
He's... on...

359
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:03,100
The... move.

360
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,537
Who?

361
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:11,442
Someone's coming for you,
and you're not gonna like it.

362
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:13,410
You guys make noises
in your sleep.

363
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:14,812
Tell us.

364
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,748
I'm not supposed to say.

365
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,952
But he's done awful things
to people,

366
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:23,887
and he'll do awful things
to you.

367
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,289
I have blue socks, too.

368
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,957
We're his food?

369
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:33,831
How old are you?

370
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,366
Nine.

371
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:41,438
So you're not the guy
that took us?

372
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,308
No.

373
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,111
You're not the lady?

374
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:48,779
What are you, blind?

375
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,415
You don't know how they think?

376
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:53,484
No, they don't...

377
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:54,752
They don't tell me much.

378
00:25:54,754 --> 00:25:56,854
I just ate a hot dog.

379
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:01,992
Could you help us, Hedwig?

380
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:05,462
No, I'm... I'm not even
supposed to be here.

381
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:07,164
I stole the light
from Mr. Dennis,

382
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,666
but he'll be back real soon,
and...

383
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:10,534
I can't steal
the light for too long,

384
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:13,303
or he'll know and get angry.

385
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,938
Et cetera.

386
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,342
See ya!

387
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:20,010
Casey:
Wait.

388
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:24,782
We heard something.

389
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,386
We didn't understand it, but...

390
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:32,956
now we do.

391
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,394
Do you know what we heard?

392
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:39,530
What did you hear?

393
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,366
Come here.

394
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,236
I'll whisper it to you.

395
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,107
Okay.

396
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,787
Casey:
This guy...

397
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,626
is coming for you.

398
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,365
You're a big fibber.

399
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,201
I never lie, Hedwig.

400
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:20,104
But... but Mr. Dennis...

401
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:23,741
He said that he followed
those two girls for four days

402
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:26,944
and that he knew
that they were the ones

403
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:29,480
that-that-that he would want.

404
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:33,250
When you're not around,

405
00:27:33,252 --> 00:27:35,919
Dennis and the lady talk
about it.

406
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,722
They talk about how he wants
a boy this time.

407
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,424
They're going to give him you.

408
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:43,360
N-no, miss... miss Patricia,
she said...

409
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,529
She said she's not mad
at me anymore.

410
00:27:45,531 --> 00:27:47,765
Sh-she sings to me sometimes.

411
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,768
I think miss Patricia
is still a little mad at you.

412
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,971
Miss Patricia thinks I'm...

413
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:56,240
She thinks I'm stupid.

414
00:27:56,242 --> 00:27:59,943
She... she thinks
I make silly mistakes.

415
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:01,411
Look at me.

416
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,381
We're like your babysitters.

417
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:09,453
We'll let you watch TV
and make you a fun dinner.

418
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,957
We all need to get out of here.

419
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,727
You could show us the way out.

420
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:19,296
We could be gone before
anybody gets back, but...

421
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,498
We have to hurry, Hedwig.

422
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,867
We have to hurry
and get out of here.

423
00:28:26,304 --> 00:28:28,305
Wait... wait a minute.

424
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,842
It took forever
to get this place safe

425
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:34,144
without the nosey bodies
that work here finding out.

426
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,946
You can't get out of here.

427
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,749
- I have to blow my nose.
- No, no, wait. Please don't go!

428
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,186
Marcia:
Who's coming?

429
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,589
This is seriously scary.

430
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:46,757
No one's coming.

431
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,729
Casey:
He said something.

432
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:58,769
He said something
about making the room safe.

433
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,772
This is all new drywall.

434
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,509
What was unsafe?

435
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,245
Wait.

436
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,380
Wait, are we sure about this?

437
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:07,571
Casey, you were right.

438
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:09,573
There's something here.

439
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:11,909
He was covering up a way out.

440
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,844
Tell me if you see him.

441
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,449
Marcia:
Casey, tell us what you see.

442
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,791
Casey:
He's here.

443
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:29,359
You can't let him in.

444
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:31,628
You can't let him in.
This is our one chance.

445
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,365
Casey:
We're not gonna make it.

446
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:37,100
Claire:
Yes, we are.

447
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,771
Claire:
Oh, my...

448
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:46,643
What...?

449
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:48,612
Hey, what are you guys doing?

450
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:53,717
Hedwig:
Hey.

451
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,321
Okay, okay, quit it.

452
00:30:57,323 --> 00:31:00,123
Okay, guys?
Let me... can you let me in?

453
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:03,593
Give us a second.
We're changing.

454
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:04,835
Hedwig:
What are you guys doing?

455
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:08,966
Let me in...

456
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,402
Guys, you're not being funny.

457
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:25,315
You're being bitches!
Now, I'm gonna slap you!

458
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,817
I'm gonna slap you
in your face and your...

459
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:28,418
Just give me as much time
as you can.

460
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:30,754
Hedwig:
You're gonna get...

461
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,036
You're gonna get me into
trouble.

462
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,594
Guys...

463
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,364
Casey:
Marcia.

464
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:47,964
Dennis:
Hey!

465
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,171
Hey!

466
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,578
Dennis: Hey!

467
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:29,706
I thought I lost you.

468
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:35,078
Would you, uh...

469
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,214
Would you step outside, please?

470
00:33:44,056 --> 00:33:46,590
You like to make fun of us,

471
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:49,159
but we're more powerful
than you think.

472
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:50,961
Step outside.

473
00:33:53,764 --> 00:33:55,165
Dennis:
Please.

474
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,642
Y-you shouldn't trick children.

475
00:34:06,777 --> 00:34:08,879
That shows who you are.

476
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,820
Look at your sweater.
It's-it's ruined.

477
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,488
It's dirty.

478
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:22,359
Remove it.

479
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,192
I'm trying to be good.

480
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,243
You will not see
your friend again.

481
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,080
She will be kept separate.

482
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:21,818
And take off your skirt.

483
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,253
You take off your shirt.

484
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:25,455
Your clothes, you got all dirty
from the dust.

485
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,716
Dr. Fletcher:
One identity in an individual

486
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:55,185
with dissociative
identity disorder

487
00:35:55,187 --> 00:35:57,420
can have high cholesterol.
One.

488
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:59,723
There have been cases
where one identity

489
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:01,625
is allergic to bee stings.

490
00:36:01,627 --> 00:36:03,059
The others are not.

491
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:05,595
Are there moments
where two identities

492
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:08,031
can coexist at the same time?

493
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:10,600
There are times
when two identities

494
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:13,970
can take the light or the spot

495
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,906
or consciousness
at the same time.

496
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:20,143
This happened with a student
that I was working with.

497
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,746
And her left
and right hand were...

498
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:25,749
Were taking notes
in different handwritings

499
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:29,052
about separate things
at the same time.

500
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:32,789
The differences in the
identities can be dramatic.

501
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:36,593
As much as the difference
between you and me

502
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:40,797
and every person
in that auditorium.

503
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,599
The identities
have different IQ's.

504
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:44,601
They have different
physical strengths.

505
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:48,271
One personality
is a Russian weightlifter

506
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:52,108
and can lift three times
his body weight.

507
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,611
Their ability to hyper-focus

508
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:59,015
and have different experiences
is astounding.

509
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:05,288
Have these individuals,
through their suffering,

510
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,491
unlocked the potential
of the brain?

511
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:14,497
Is this the ultimate doorway

512
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:18,501
to all things we call unknown?

513
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:25,375
Is this where our sense
of the supernatural comes from?

514
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:42,025
It's about depth and, uh...

515
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,560
And-and curves and...

516
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,362
Hey, you see that one?

517
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:48,598
It's-it's kind of like
a chenille sweater-dress.

518
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,937
Who are you?

519
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,243
Barry.

520
00:38:01,645 --> 00:38:03,480
I don't think you are.

521
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:07,417
I've developed a nose
for sensing

522
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:11,054
whom I'm talking to
and whom I'm not.

523
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,822
Have I done something?

524
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:15,392
You've e-mailed
for an unscheduled appointment

525
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:17,260
two days in a row.

526
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,829
We... we're just
feeling overwhelmed.

527
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:23,233
I... garden-variety issues.

528
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:28,171
I think Orwell or Jade
or Samuel or Heinrich

529
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,940
had the light for a moment
and e-mailed me.

530
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:33,376
And you're here to tell me
everything's okay.

531
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:35,779
I e-mailed you.

532
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:40,150
May I talk to one of them,
please?

533
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,289
That can't happen.

534
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:49,426
I... told them that I wanted

535
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:51,761
to spend the session
with you today.

536
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,298
I'm going to ask again.

537
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,302
To whom am I speaking with now?

538
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:01,304
Dr. Fletcher...

539
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:03,406
It's Barry.

540
00:39:03,408 --> 00:39:05,809
It doesn't seem like Barry.

541
00:39:05,811 --> 00:39:08,545
Barry is an extroverted leader.

542
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:10,713
Yes, I am.

543
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:14,651
I'm gonna take
a professional guess

544
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:18,254
based on the description
of all 23 identities

545
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:23,126
that live in Kevin's body
that I've gotten from Barry.

546
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:29,132
I think I'm talking to Dennis.

547
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:34,003
But he's been banned
from the light

548
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,406
because, among other reasons,

549
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:40,143
he has a proclivity to watch
young girls dance naked,

550
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:43,079
which he himself knows is wrong

551
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:45,515
and has fought against
with little success.

552
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:48,485
I'm encouraged
we can finally meet.

553
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:51,287
And I've guessed this
because you've adjusted

554
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,690
the chocolate dish twice
since you came in here,

555
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:55,458
and I understand you have OCD.

556
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,627
Oh, now I see.

557
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,462
Now I see. That's clever.

558
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:01,464
That's clever,
but I'm-I'm-I'm not Dennis.

559
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:04,634
And you and Patricia
have been banned from the light

560
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,603
for quite a while now.

561
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:09,172
Primarily, shall we say,
because of your beliefs.

562
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:11,441
Patricia and Dennis
are very unstable.

563
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,042
I'm not Dennis.

564
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:15,278
Have you both taken charge now?

565
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,847
Please believe me, I'm Barry.

566
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,389
You must forgive me. It's...

567
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:29,392
My job is to challenge you.

568
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:33,296
And, as you must know by now,
I have plenty of opinions

569
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:35,732
about how everyone
should live their lives.

570
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:39,736
You... a-ask me something
about fashion.

571
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:41,671
I'll prove it, or I'll...

572
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,907
Look, look, look, look.
Lindt.

573
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,877
Yeah, look.

574
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:51,981
You see? I'm not Dennis.

575
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,584
You want me to do
something else?

576
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:56,185
You got ice cream?

577
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,054
Oh, and this shirt's
a cotton blend anyway,

578
00:40:58,056 --> 00:41:00,256
and the collar
is from three seasons ago.

579
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:02,659
Snood? I mean, come on.

580
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:23,880
Jai, what health-conscious
fast food purveyor

581
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:26,282
did you originally solicit
to buy these chicken wings

582
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:29,285
you've so lovingly reheated
in a minor suicidal gesture?

583
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:31,554
Hooters. And you can't just
throw them out, Dr. Fletcher.

584
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:33,856
Ah, this is wrong
on so many levels.

585
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:37,594
We finished about 3:15,
so look around 3:18.

586
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:39,195
You're getting a little soft

587
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,730
- around the middle, jai.
- Mm-hmm.

588
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,765
Dr. Fletcher:
The authors of Hooters

589
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:45,068
play on our incessant need
for fat

590
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,537
and man's incessant need
to be in the proximity

591
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,105
of augmented breasts.

592
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:52,375
It's like Henry v
ran a fast food franchise.

593
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:53,710
It's a good place,
Dr. Fletcher.

594
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:55,311
Right.

595
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,948
Jai: Hey, how'd you know
the trash would be spilled?

596
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,450
How can I say this, jai?

597
00:42:00,452 --> 00:42:02,986
You're not the most meticulous
of people.

598
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,170
This guy isn't very neat, is he?

599
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:22,405
He walked right
through the trash.

600
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:23,940
No, jai.

601
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:25,942
Any normal person
would have walked around it.

602
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:27,877
That was an act.

603
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:32,415
What are you up to, Dennis?

604
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:36,285
Or is it Patricia
who's deciding things?

605
00:42:38,456 --> 00:42:41,424
Marcia:
<i>We're not gonna die.</i>

606
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:44,293
<i>Bad things happen.</i>

607
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,362
<i>But not like this.</i>

608
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,766
Casey...

609
00:42:49,768 --> 00:42:51,701
Talk to me.

610
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:57,140
We need to get to a window
or a door or something.

611
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:58,841
Don't you think?

612
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:16,859
The thrill, Casey,
is about whether you can

613
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:20,029
or can't outsmart this animal.

614
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,735
See, you didn't used to like
to come out here.

615
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:28,304
This is like
our family tradition, right?

616
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:31,741
Good shot, big brother.

617
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:33,576
Thank you, John.

618
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:43,319
I have your meal, sleepyhead.

619
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,325
Eat.

620
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,601
It's good?

621
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:01,337
It's got paprika in it.

622
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,106
Mmm.

623
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,275
I'm sorry.

624
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:12,315
I think I'll put
a pretty flower in your hair.

625
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,685
There we are.

626
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,695
That's to show
how important you are.

627
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:27,530
Come along.

628
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:29,465
We'll have a proper meal.

629
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:35,238
I understand, this must all seem

630
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,140
so unsatisfactory for you.

631
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:40,510
But we are doing
the best we can.

632
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:00,797
Good?

633
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,334
Mm-hmm?

634
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,438
Can Claire come eat with us?

635
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,940
No.

636
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:13,776
No, I'm afraid
that can't happen.

637
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:18,281
She almost ruined
our big reception.

638
00:45:18,283 --> 00:45:19,283
Mmm.

639
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:27,323
I've heard that Asian people's
music aids digestion.

640
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:29,192
Hmm.

641
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:31,561
I'll make you a second sandwich.

642
00:45:35,465 --> 00:45:38,201
Do you know...

643
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:42,872
A family of lions
can eat 35 pounds a day?

644
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:48,311
A buck can lose 30%
of its weight

645
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:51,480
during mating season
chasing does around.

646
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,115
They're crepuscular, right?

647
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:57,386
Means they travel around
during dusk and dawn.

648
00:45:57,388 --> 00:45:59,789
Good for you.

649
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:16,873
It's crooked.

650
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,308
I... forgive me.

651
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:33,789
I don't know if you know,
but tigers have only 30 teeth.

652
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,761
That's 12 less than a dog.

653
00:46:38,763 --> 00:46:41,163
I thought that was a fun fact.

654
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,361
Casey:
No!

655
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,065
Go to your room.

656
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:18,034
Shut the door. Do it now.

657
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,271
In the sun,

658
00:47:55,273 --> 00:47:58,507
we will find our passion.

659
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:00,576
In the sun,

660
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:04,080
we will find our purpose.

661
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:11,587
You've always been protected.

662
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:13,990
You've never truly suffered.

663
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:17,126
And that's why we chose you.

664
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:19,328
You've always been asleep.

665
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,933
You never had a chance.

666
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:25,534
Shh.

667
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:32,208
You never had a chance.

668
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,176
Dennis: The dark-haired girl,

669
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:35,978
she's gonna be kept
in another closet.

670
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,847
I... you might as well know
at this point.

671
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:40,816
The beast...

672
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:43,219
He's coming for you.

673
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:46,155
All three of you,
you're gonna be kept separate.

674
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:47,990
Y-y-you've got...

675
00:48:47,992 --> 00:48:51,327
You've got a... you've got
a crumb on your shirt.

676
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:53,529
You've got...

677
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,831
Please take it off.

678
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:58,968
Just...

679
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:00,970
Just take it off.

680
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,254
Hey.

681
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:54,690
Hedwig: It wasn't nice what
you said about miss Patricia.

682
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,592
You lied.

683
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:03,899
I'm sorry about that, Hedwig.

684
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:05,968
You guys lied to me,

685
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:08,971
made me scared, et cetera.

686
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:14,910
Mr. Dennis, he says
you wear a lot of shirts.

687
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:16,979
I like this shirt.

688
00:50:16,981 --> 00:50:18,814
Thank you.

689
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:21,317
Do you know who Dennis
and miss Patricia are?

690
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:23,219
Casey:
No.

691
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:29,425
See, every one of us
has to wait in a chair,

692
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:33,496
and Barry, he decides
who stands in the light.

693
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:36,632
But Barry lost that power
because of me.

694
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:41,270
I can wish myself
into the light any time I want.

695
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:45,641
It's a... it's a special power.

696
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:50,946
Barry just has to keep sitting
in his chair if I want him to.

697
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:52,615
That's why Dennis
and miss Patricia

698
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:54,950
said I could be with them.

699
00:50:54,952 --> 00:50:58,954
Dennis and miss Patricia,
they believe in the beast

700
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:00,923
and what he can do.

701
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,961
Have you seen him?

702
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:09,765
The... beast?

703
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:11,467
N-no.

704
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:13,135
Can I kiss you?

705
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:15,804
I wanted to kiss the other girl
with the dark hair,

706
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,907
but she's in trouble.

707
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:24,013
So, do you want to?
I mean, I don't know much

708
00:51:24,015 --> 00:51:26,649
- about kissing, though.
- Yeah.

709
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:31,487
Okay.

710
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:34,190
Uh, okay, here we go.

711
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:37,193
I'm so nervous.

712
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:40,129
One, two...

713
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:41,630
Three.

714
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:59,114
You might be pregnant now.

715
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:03,652
Am I a good kisser?

716
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:05,054
Yeah.

717
00:52:05,056 --> 00:52:06,522
I like dancing.

718
00:52:06,524 --> 00:52:08,157
Do you like dancing?

719
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,161
I-I... I like dancing
to my Cd player in my room.

720
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:14,496
Kanye west is my main man.

721
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:18,033
I... we got my...
My Cd player set up in my...

722
00:52:18,035 --> 00:52:19,935
My room right-right...
Right next to my window.

723
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:21,670
I'm like...

724
00:52:24,442 --> 00:52:26,342
I'm... mmm.

725
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:28,877
Mmm. Mmm.

726
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:31,080
- We gots the moves.
- Wow.

727
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:36,552
Hey, maybe I could
watch you dance

728
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:39,922
and listen to music with you.

729
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:43,058
No, my music's in my room.

730
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:45,127
Oh, right.

731
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,632
- Maybe...
- Yeah?

732
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:52,534
You could sneak me there.

733
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,970
Are you trying to trick me?

734
00:52:54,972 --> 00:52:57,439
Et cetera?

735
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:59,308
I'll tell on you.

736
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:00,943
- Hey...
- I'm-I'm telling on you.

737
00:53:00,945 --> 00:53:02,611
I'll tell you something.

738
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:05,047
And you can tell me
if I'm lying or not, okay?

739
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:06,448
- Mm-hmm.
- Like a test.

740
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,018
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

741
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:18,060
I get into trouble at school
on purpose.

742
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:25,067
So I can get sent to detention.

743
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,507
To get away...

744
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:33,642
From everyone.

745
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,550
So that I can be alone.

746
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:56,165
Okay, I'll show you
something cool in my room.

747
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:58,334
Okay.

748
00:53:58,336 --> 00:53:59,835
But after Mr. Dennis

749
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:01,837
has finished
his getting-ready ritual.

750
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,806
I have to go.

751
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:05,207
He's got an appointment.

752
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:07,309
Wh-when I fall asleep,
one of the others

753
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:10,312
keeps trying to reach
the doctor lady to tell on us.

754
00:54:10,314 --> 00:54:12,648
Barry: That pant, it's got
a... it's got a red lining.

755
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:15,517
You can see it in the long slit
down the side.

756
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:17,319
Dr. Fletcher:
We've been talking about

757
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:19,988
silk-and-wool blend
for 20 minutes.

758
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,658
Well, can I guess
that you e-mailed me

759
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:26,495
in the middle of the night
for an emergency session

760
00:54:26,497 --> 00:54:29,164
due to garden-variety issues?

761
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:34,236
I was down, and I e-mailed you.

762
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:36,538
And I woke up,
and I feel better.

763
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,907
I-I feel better.

764
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,677
I had a thought.

765
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:43,512
Uh-uh.

766
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:46,014
I want to talk
about the incident at work.

767
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,583
It's okay, Barry.

768
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:49,218
You're safe.

769
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,987
I just want to bring
the details back.

770
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:54,957
We'll just talk
about the details.

771
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,660
A high school
from Camden, New Jersey

772
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:01,196
was on a field trip
at your place of work,

773
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:04,233
and two young ladies
came up to you.

774
00:55:04,235 --> 00:55:07,202
And one took your hand

775
00:55:07,204 --> 00:55:09,171
and put it under her shirt
on her breast,

776
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:10,839
and the second one did the same.

777
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:13,942
And then they just ran off
laughing to their friends.

778
00:55:13,944 --> 00:55:16,278
You surmised
that it might be on a dare.

779
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,114
You said they were 17 or 18.

780
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:21,216
You said it upset you for days.

781
00:55:21,218 --> 00:55:22,851
It was just a teenage prank.

782
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:24,920
I-I get that now.

783
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:28,257
And see, that's my mistake.

784
00:55:28,259 --> 00:55:33,195
I believe that I went over this
incident with you too fast.

785
00:55:33,197 --> 00:55:35,697
Although you said you were fine

786
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:40,202
and the other identities
I met with said it was fine,

787
00:55:40,204 --> 00:55:44,239
I believe that this
brought up issues

788
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:47,242
from when you
were a child and abused.

789
00:55:47,244 --> 00:55:50,078
Sometimes another incident
of abuse

790
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,980
can cause suppressed
personalities

791
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:53,749
to take the light.

792
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:58,887
Dennis, if this is you,
I completely understand

793
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:01,056
why you felt the need

794
00:56:01,058 --> 00:56:03,058
to take over
and protect the others.

795
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,326
Please.

796
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:06,161
Doctor, not this again.

797
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,897
The others told me
that you and Patricia

798
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:11,467
told the group about this beast.

799
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:14,970
And I told them that these
are just scary stories

800
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:19,575
that Dennis and Patricia
tell the others to scare them.

801
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:22,277
How this beast
can crawl on walls

802
00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:25,948
like the best rock climbers,
using the slightest friction

803
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:28,283
and imperfections
to hold his body close

804
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:31,520
to seemingly sheer surfaces.

805
00:56:31,522 --> 00:56:36,725
How his skin is thick and tough
like the hide of a rhinoceros.

806
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:43,499
Do you really believe
the stories about the beast?

807
00:56:44,767 --> 00:56:45,801
Hmm.

808
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:49,137
If this is you, Dennis,

809
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:52,107
I understand
why Kevin needs you.

810
00:56:53,376 --> 00:56:55,777
You are strong and disciplined,

811
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,880
you are precise,

812
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:00,716
and you will not
be taken advantage of.

813
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:04,353
You can trust me.

814
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:09,057
For example,
I do have the ability

815
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:11,727
to use Kevin's full name
and bring him forward

816
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:13,362
as he has in the past.

817
00:57:13,364 --> 00:57:16,698
But I wouldn't do that.

818
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,869
I know that that
would be chaos for all of you.

819
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,905
Everyone would grab the light.

820
00:57:22,907 --> 00:57:26,675
I don't want
to hurt any of you that way.

821
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:28,911
You don't have to hide.

822
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,615
I know you are someone
who cares for Kevin.

823
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:39,488
You are not evil to me.

824
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:44,226
You were necessary.

825
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:50,799
Dennis, is that you?

826
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:07,683
They keep calling us
"the horde."

827
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,021
The others, you know?

828
00:58:13,023 --> 00:58:17,693
Miss Patricia and I,
we are ridiculed.

829
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:19,294
Now, we're not perfect,

830
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:22,764
but we don't deserve
to be ridiculed.

831
00:58:23,866 --> 00:58:25,267
We're all struggling.

832
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:27,169
They have to admit that.

833
00:58:32,408 --> 00:58:35,510
I am pleased to meet you,
Dennis.

834
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,680
You, too.

835
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,652
I assume you don't know
who e-mailed me

836
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:45,988
for the emergency sessions?

837
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,823
One of the others.

838
00:58:48,925 --> 00:58:50,325
Are you in charge?

839
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:52,260
Yeah, we've taken charge.

840
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:55,263
We're the only ones
that can protect Kevin.

841
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:58,066
We're all here to protect Kevin.

842
00:58:58,068 --> 00:58:59,801
He's very weak.

843
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:05,307
He doesn't know
how powerful we can be.

844
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:08,110
Would you mind telling me when
you first came into existence?

845
00:59:11,582 --> 00:59:13,815
And how you and Patricia,

846
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:17,185
the other undesirable identity,
became aligned?

847
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,690
That's okay.

848
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:24,760
Do you still have
strong beliefs?

849
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:26,928
That depends on what.

850
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,799
This story of the beast.

851
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:38,507
One thing, Dennis,
that may comfort you

852
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:40,308
if you are confused

853
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:44,012
is that you've met
the other alters.

854
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:46,682
You're all in a room
in chairs, right?

855
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:49,017
Mmm, yeah.

856
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:50,952
But you never met the beast.

857
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:53,488
Because he doesn't reside
with the rest of you.

858
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:55,524
Because he resides
in the train yard,

859
00:59:55,526 --> 00:59:57,059
as the story goes,

860
00:59:57,061 --> 00:59:59,394
because Kevin's dad left
on a train.

861
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:02,831
But the fact is you and Patricia

862
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:05,067
have never met the beast.

863
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:07,035
Have you?

864
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:08,537
No.

865
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:12,374
That's because
he's not an alter.

866
01:00:12,376 --> 01:00:15,444
He's not the 24th identity.

867
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,980
He's a fantasy.

868
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:40,235
Hurry up. Let's go.

869
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:42,137
Come on. It's time.

870
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:46,241
Shh.

871
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:51,113
Shh, shh.

872
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:09,791
Wow.

873
01:02:09,793 --> 01:02:12,194
I know.

874
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:15,030
This is your Cd player?

875
01:02:15,032 --> 01:02:16,865
Yeah.

876
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,336
You don't like it?

877
01:02:21,338 --> 01:02:23,839
- It's... it's not new or...
- No.

878
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:26,441
No, I'm just, uh...

879
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:29,644
I'm-I'm confused.

880
01:02:29,646 --> 01:02:32,280
You said it was near a window.

881
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:34,015
Oh, that's here.

882
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:36,852
Watch.

883
01:02:36,854 --> 01:02:38,353
Now it's closed.

884
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,122
Now it's open.

885
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:43,225
Now it's closed.

886
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:46,928
Now it's open.

887
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:57,873
Did you think
it was a real window?

888
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:04,212
So you could leave, et cetera?

889
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:10,151
Help me get out of here, Hedwig.

890
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,553
I...

891
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:14,656
Just get me the keys
and let me out the door.

892
01:03:14,658 --> 01:03:16,358
Please.

893
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,326
Miss Patricia says that nobody

894
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:21,029
will make fun of me anymore
when the beast comes.

895
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:23,565
She says that everyone
will see how amazing I am,

896
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:25,333
and then all
of the silly mistakes,

897
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:26,835
they won't matter anymore.

898
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:28,737
I-I-i think you should go
back to your room.

899
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:30,038
- No! Wait, please.
- Ow!

900
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,706
I want to hear
your Kanye west albums.

901
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:33,008
- Ow.
- Show me your room.

902
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,576
Let's stay here.

903
01:03:34,578 --> 01:03:37,212
- I'm sorry I asked to leave.
- I can't.

904
01:03:37,214 --> 01:03:39,514
- You said you wanted to show me
something cool, right? -No.

905
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:41,082
- Show me something.
- I don't want to.

906
01:03:41,084 --> 01:03:42,817
- Please.
- I...

907
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:47,122
This!

908
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:55,530
Oh, wow.

909
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:58,300
It's nice.

910
01:03:58,302 --> 01:04:00,535
It's not a toy.

911
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:07,242
This is real?

912
01:04:07,244 --> 01:04:10,045
Yes.

913
01:04:10,047 --> 01:04:12,113
It's Mr. Dennis's.

914
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:16,184
He doesn't even know I stole it.

915
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:19,688
Pretty cool, right?

916
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,891
You can listen
to people talking,

917
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:24,993
and they don't even know
you're listening.

918
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:28,930
Who does this talk to?

919
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:30,632
Don't touch that.

920
01:04:30,634 --> 01:04:33,068
I just want to see if it works.

921
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,771
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

922
01:04:36,773 --> 01:04:38,506
Don't touch those buttons.
You're gonna get us found out.

923
01:04:38,508 --> 01:04:41,343
- Man: Yeah, east gate here. What up?
- You gonna... shit.

924
01:04:45,247 --> 01:04:47,315
Don't talk.

925
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:49,484
- Man: What up?
- Don't talk.

926
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:53,421
Hello?

927
01:04:53,423 --> 01:04:55,123
- I'm gonna slap you!
- No!

928
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,758
Man: Who's this?

929
01:04:58,128 --> 01:05:00,261
Hello. Hello.
My name is Casey Cooke.

930
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:01,763
I'm being held in a basement.

931
01:05:01,765 --> 01:05:03,325
I've been abducted
with two other girls.

932
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:07,369
Man:
Who the hell is this?

933
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:17,278
Man:
Hello?

934
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,481
Casey Cooke.

935
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:20,648
I've been abducted.

936
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,018
You need to find me.

937
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,319
Man:
Betty, is that you?

938
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:25,787
This isn't funny.

939
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:26,788
Casey:
Call the police.

940
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,456
I must be near you.

941
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:31,159
I'm being held
in a basement or something.

942
01:05:31,161 --> 01:05:32,494
Man:
Okay, Betty, listen.

943
01:05:32,496 --> 01:05:34,629
Tell Larry and fish I said hi.

944
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:37,032
Tell him I still got
his orange headphones and...

945
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:39,401
I don't know where I am.

946
01:05:39,403 --> 01:05:41,069
There's a man here.

947
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:43,471
He abducted us,
and he's going to kill me.

948
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:55,417
I only have a few hours left.

949
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:00,922
Casey: Please.

950
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:04,325
Casey:
I'm begging you.

951
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:08,096
Somebody save us.

952
01:06:08,098 --> 01:06:09,998
Man:
Wait, who is this?

953
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,967
And how did you get one
of our walkies?

954
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:23,344
Patricia: Put your hands
together in contrition.

955
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:26,881
In the sun,

956
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:28,983
we will find our passion.

957
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,620
In the sun,

958
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:38,126
we will find our purpose.

959
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:51,906
I read that on a sympathy card
in a supermarket.

960
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:55,777
It was for funerals,
but I thought it was beautiful.

961
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:04,853
Dennis will explain the meaning
of this evening.

962
01:07:38,254 --> 01:07:42,624
The beast is a sentient creature

963
01:07:42,626 --> 01:07:46,528
who represents the highest form
of human's evolution.

964
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:50,598
He believes the time
of ordinary humanity is over.

965
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,836
I hope this makes you feel calm.

966
01:07:56,505 --> 01:08:02,043
You will be in the presence
of something greater.

967
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:04,712
I was gonna ask
for your last shirt, but...

968
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:06,481
But I won't.

969
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:08,950
Because tonight
is a sacred night.

970
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,220
It's almost over.

971
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:21,496
Casey.

972
01:08:21,498 --> 01:08:23,298
Come on.

973
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,333
Let's pretend
we're animals again.

974
01:08:25,335 --> 01:08:27,068
Come on.

975
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,305
Casey, come on.

976
01:08:30,307 --> 01:08:32,073
This is our game.

977
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:36,578
I'll tell your dad
you're not being nice.

978
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,000
Come on, take off your stuff.

979
01:08:59,002 --> 01:09:00,735
Animals don't wear clothes.

980
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:02,170
Come on.

981
01:09:02,172 --> 01:09:04,005
Yeah, yeah.

982
01:09:04,007 --> 01:09:05,440
Come on.

983
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:32,533
Hey, Casey bear.

984
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:36,871
This isn't funny.

985
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:42,644
Is it loaded?

986
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:46,881
Casey...

987
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:49,851
I'm your uncle.

988
01:09:53,555 --> 01:09:55,757
Stop it, Casey.

989
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:57,825
Put that gun down.

990
01:09:57,827 --> 01:10:00,428
I'm getting upset.

991
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,929
I'm about to get very angry.

992
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:03,598
Give me the gun!

993
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:12,307
Could've killed me.

994
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,075
Th-this place is closed.

995
01:11:21,077 --> 01:11:22,377
- No, it's-it's okay.
- You can't get in.

996
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:23,911
Dr. Fletcher:
No, it's okay.

997
01:11:30,018 --> 01:11:32,220
Hello, Dennis.

998
01:11:32,222 --> 01:11:35,823
One of the others
e-mailed me just now.

999
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,160
- Is everything okay?
- We're fine.

1000
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:43,765
Dennis, Kevin is really lucky
to have you.

1001
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:45,900
You are quite extraordinary.

1002
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:49,170
I just don't want you guys
to get hurt.

1003
01:11:54,676 --> 01:11:57,545
You think we're extraordinary?

1004
01:11:57,547 --> 01:12:00,515
I like you, Dennis.

1005
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:02,216
May I come in?

1006
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:04,085
And can we talk?

1007
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:09,857
I know you want
to tell me something.

1008
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:12,326
Why don't you just tell me?

1009
01:12:27,709 --> 01:12:29,377
Dennis:
We're very similar, you and I.

1010
01:12:29,379 --> 01:12:32,079
Both on the outside, looking in.

1011
01:12:32,081 --> 01:12:33,981
Please, sit.

1012
01:12:33,983 --> 01:12:36,617
I don't get many visitors.

1013
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:38,953
Uh...
I'll get you some water.

1014
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:41,789
They got a proper quarters
for me in a building

1015
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:44,625
on the south side,
but we prefer it here.

1016
01:12:44,627 --> 01:12:46,727
When they promoted me
to head of maintenance,

1017
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:49,263
they said I could have it.

1018
01:12:49,265 --> 01:12:51,732
Dr. Fletcher:
Who are you going to meet?

1019
01:12:56,772 --> 01:13:00,408
Dennis:
I want to talk about...

1020
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:03,945
Kevin and...

1021
01:13:03,947 --> 01:13:07,315
What his mother did to him.

1022
01:13:07,317 --> 01:13:09,984
I remember it all.

1023
01:13:09,986 --> 01:13:12,820
I'm happy
you're suddenly so open.

1024
01:13:12,822 --> 01:13:15,490
Kevin's mother
had rather malevolent ways

1025
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:18,259
of punishing a three-year-old.

1026
01:13:18,261 --> 01:13:20,161
Is that when you arrived
in the light?

1027
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:21,863
Yeah.

1028
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:25,266
The one way
to avoid her attention

1029
01:13:25,268 --> 01:13:29,604
was to keep everything
spotless, everything perfect.

1030
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,941
I know you're coming
from good intentions, Dennis,

1031
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:37,011
but there are other ways
to help Kevin now.

1032
01:13:37,013 --> 01:13:41,549
I've lost so many patients
into the system.

1033
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:43,050
I want you to know, Dennis,

1034
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:45,887
I will never stop fighting
for you.

1035
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:49,690
My patients
have become my family.

1036
01:13:49,692 --> 01:13:51,025
They are what I've chosen

1037
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:53,361
instead of
a more traditional path.

1038
01:13:53,363 --> 01:13:56,831
I hope you feel you can be
truly honest with me.

1039
01:13:56,833 --> 01:14:00,902
I actually want
to be honest with you.

1040
01:14:00,904 --> 01:14:03,471
I lied before.

1041
01:14:03,473 --> 01:14:07,241
When you asked if I'd ever
met the beast,

1042
01:14:07,243 --> 01:14:09,243
I said no.

1043
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:11,412
That really isn't true.

1044
01:14:13,982 --> 01:14:16,717
You wrote about a woman
in Germany

1045
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:19,420
who'd been blind for ten years.

1046
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:23,324
And then it was discovered
that she had d.I.D.

1047
01:14:23,326 --> 01:14:27,328
Then three of her identities
developed sight.

1048
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:31,032
And you speculated
that her optical nerves

1049
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:34,669
regenerated
because of her beliefs.

1050
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:36,871
What are you trying to say?

1051
01:14:36,873 --> 01:14:38,873
There are things, Dr. Fletcher,

1052
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,509
that all of us
would find hard to believe.

1053
01:14:41,511 --> 01:14:44,779
Are you trying to tell me
there's a 24th identity?

1054
01:14:44,781 --> 01:14:46,747
You protect the broken.

1055
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:48,449
When you said that you thought

1056
01:14:48,451 --> 01:14:51,018
this situation
was extraordinary,

1057
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:53,354
I knew you can maybe understand.

1058
01:14:53,356 --> 01:14:55,022
Understand what?

1059
01:14:55,024 --> 01:14:58,025
The beast...

1060
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:00,528
Is real.

1061
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:02,129
He's just emerged.

1062
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:05,600
You were right about everything.

1063
01:15:05,602 --> 01:15:07,668
What does he look like?

1064
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,639
He's much bigger than I am,

1065
01:15:11,641 --> 01:15:14,809
and I'm the biggest
of all of us.

1066
01:15:14,811 --> 01:15:16,544
He's tall.

1067
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:19,046
He's very muscular.

1068
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:21,382
And he's got
a long mane of hair,

1069
01:15:21,384 --> 01:15:25,987
and his fingers are...
Are twice the length of ours.

1070
01:15:25,989 --> 01:15:30,124
He believes
we are extraordinary.

1071
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:35,329
That we don't represent
a mistake, but our potential.

1072
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:40,034
You say the same things.

1073
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:44,405
He's on the move.

1074
01:15:44,407 --> 01:15:47,308
What does that mean?

1075
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:50,077
I don't understand.

1076
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:53,347
He can't be real.

1077
01:15:53,349 --> 01:15:57,652
There must be limits to what
a human being can become.

1078
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:03,124
And there's another whole part
of the story, isn't there?

1079
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:06,427
About the eating
of the impure young?

1080
01:16:06,429 --> 01:16:09,697
What does "impure" even mean?

1081
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:12,099
Well, we should discuss that

1082
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:14,268
so that you can
understand fully.

1083
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:16,203
Understand what?

1084
01:16:16,205 --> 01:16:18,072
Sometimes...

1085
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:21,442
there's just no other way.

1086
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:26,580
Who are you going to meet?

1087
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:30,718
Him.

1088
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,624
You know what?

1089
01:16:36,626 --> 01:16:39,627
I would love to take notes
on all of this.

1090
01:16:39,629 --> 01:16:43,831
We should probably discuss this
in a proper session tomorrow.

1091
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,132
Really?

1092
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:47,001
You're okay with this?

1093
01:16:47,003 --> 01:16:50,571
This has been so wonderful...
You being so open.

1094
01:16:50,573 --> 01:16:52,907
I can see that you feel
very empowered

1095
01:16:52,909 --> 01:16:54,475
by the philosophies
of the beast.

1096
01:16:54,477 --> 01:16:56,811
- I...
- I'm going to go now.

1097
01:16:56,813 --> 01:16:58,212
I knew you would understand.

1098
01:16:58,214 --> 01:17:00,614
I'll see you.

1099
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:14,895
Dr. Fletcher:
Would you mind...

1100
01:17:16,998 --> 01:17:18,999
if I used your bathroom?

1101
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:23,270
No.

1102
01:17:23,272 --> 01:17:27,441
It's down the hall,
near the stairs, on your left.

1103
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:34,181
Dennis:
How we doing?

1104
01:17:34,183 --> 01:17:36,083
I'm okay.

1105
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,224
Are you real?

1106
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:22,163
Marcia:
Who is it?

1107
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:23,497
Help me.

1108
01:18:25,134 --> 01:18:28,135
- Help me.
- Marcia: Is someone there?

1109
01:18:28,137 --> 01:18:30,437
- Oh, my...
- Claire: Help me.

1110
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,406
Please help me.

1111
01:18:34,143 --> 01:18:36,944
They will never reach
their potential.

1112
01:18:36,946 --> 01:18:38,479
They don't really matter.

1113
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:40,481
Listen to me, Dennis.

1114
01:18:40,483 --> 01:18:43,851
I should've listened better.

1115
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:46,654
I should've understood
what you're capable of,

1116
01:18:46,656 --> 01:18:48,322
how powerful you are.

1117
01:18:48,324 --> 01:18:50,858
Patricia says
your way isn't working.

1118
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:53,294
The world will understand now.

1119
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:58,098
Dennis,
this is an egregious wrong.

1120
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,101
These young women are suffering.

1121
01:19:01,103 --> 01:19:02,536
This is a crime.

1122
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:05,039
I can't let you keep them here.

1123
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:06,540
We've gotta stop this.

1124
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:09,043
This identity is monstrous.

1125
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:10,945
I'm really sad
you feel this way.

1126
01:19:10,947 --> 01:19:13,180
Can't you see?
He is formed

1127
01:19:13,182 --> 01:19:15,349
because of your time
in this place.

1128
01:19:43,144 --> 01:19:45,512
Claire:
There's a lady.

1129
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,314
Someone's here.

1130
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:50,985
We need to get out
of these rooms.

1131
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:54,488
Is there anything in your room?

1132
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:55,756
Anything that we could use?

1133
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:06,066
Claire:
There's nothing in here.

1134
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:10,070
There's a hanger.

1135
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:36,597
Thank you, Dennis.

1136
01:20:36,599 --> 01:20:38,699
Here you go, sir.

1137
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,986
It sounded like
there were slide bolts

1138
01:20:58,988 --> 01:21:01,322
on the outside of our doors.

1139
01:21:01,324 --> 01:21:03,991
See if you can move the lock
through the crack in the door.

1140
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:15,129
Claire:
Stay calm.

1141
01:22:15,131 --> 01:22:16,530
We're getting out of here.

1142
01:22:16,532 --> 01:22:18,065
We're gonna get Casey.

1143
01:22:19,335 --> 01:22:21,268
Claire:
You can do this, Marcia.

1144
01:22:57,105 --> 01:22:58,672
With regard
to Chahamana's defeat

1145
01:22:58,674 --> 01:23:00,507
and Muhammad of Ghor's conquests

1146
01:23:00,509 --> 01:23:03,510
between 1192 and 1200,

1147
01:23:03,512 --> 01:23:07,848
I would liken it
to Muhammad's brazen ultimatum

1148
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:11,285
that Prithviraj
either apostatize or fight.

1149
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:15,689
Like Prithviraj's defiance,

1150
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:19,293
we should stand up
to the horde's advances.

1151
01:23:19,295 --> 01:23:21,728
In the face
of their scare tactics,

1152
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:24,198
we should show...

1153
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,733
I hate my Insulin shots.

1154
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:29,736
No one else around here
has to take them.

1155
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:32,873
Why do I have to have diabetes?

1156
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:35,442
All the doctors,
besides Dr. Fletcher,

1157
01:23:35,444 --> 01:23:37,744
say that we're the same person.

1158
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:41,148
Just personalities, huh?

1159
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:42,983
How do you explain
I'm the only one

1160
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:44,785
that needs these,
you motherfu...

1161
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:52,726
Barry: I'm wearing cargo pants
from the '90s.

1162
01:23:52,728 --> 01:23:55,129
And a scarf.

1163
01:23:55,131 --> 01:23:57,397
If it wasn't for the Varvatos
t-shirt underneath,

1164
01:23:57,399 --> 01:24:00,000
I'd be a mess.

1165
01:24:00,002 --> 01:24:03,103
I got no taste
for things right now.

1166
01:24:03,105 --> 01:24:07,407
<i>I'm worried sick.</i>

1167
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:11,311
<i>I have a very bad feeling
that I'm losing time.</i>

1168
01:24:11,313 --> 01:24:12,980
I decide who gets the light,
right?

1169
01:24:12,982 --> 01:24:15,916
I think someone
is stealing the light from me

1170
01:24:15,918 --> 01:24:18,452
when I'm not aware.

1171
01:24:18,454 --> 01:24:22,122
<i>The horde keeps obsessing about
the ones who haven't suffered.</i>

1172
01:24:22,124 --> 01:24:25,125
<i>I don't know where
they're going with this,</i>

1173
01:24:25,127 --> 01:24:27,161
<i>but it scares me.</i>

1174
01:25:28,257 --> 01:25:30,591
Claire: Picture yourself
in a couple hours at home.

1175
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:33,860
On the couch,

1176
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:36,830
in that ugly-ass sweatshirt
that you love.

1177
01:25:45,908 --> 01:25:49,576
Jesus. It's an animal!

1178
01:25:49,578 --> 01:25:52,679
He goes like this if there's
a coyote or something.

1179
01:27:32,348 --> 01:27:34,881
K-Kevin. Kevin.

1180
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:38,618
Kev... Kev...

1181
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:06,146
Thank you...

1182
01:28:06,148 --> 01:28:10,150
For helping us till now.

1183
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:16,990
Kev... Kev...

1184
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:15,816
Barry:
<i>I guess I should tell</i>

1185
01:29:15,818 --> 01:29:17,417
<i>Dr. Fletcher
about this, but...</i>

1186
01:29:17,419 --> 01:29:19,986
She'll worry.

1187
01:29:19,988 --> 01:29:22,055
She's such a sweet woman.

1188
01:29:23,625 --> 01:29:27,461
I believe I will go
for a nice walk

1189
01:29:27,463 --> 01:29:31,798
and think this through
organizationally.

1190
01:29:34,136 --> 01:29:38,438
Thus ends my journal for Monday.

1191
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,840
Ciao.

1192
01:31:00,855 --> 01:31:02,589
Claire.

1193
01:31:04,926 --> 01:31:06,259
Marcia.

1194
01:31:28,883 --> 01:31:31,017
Claire.

1195
01:31:31,019 --> 01:31:32,586
Claire, let's go.

1196
01:32:43,824 --> 01:32:46,092
Casey:
"Kevin Wendell crumb."

1197
01:33:11,686 --> 01:33:13,953
Casey:
Kevin Wendell crumb?

1198
01:33:18,894 --> 01:33:20,060
Kevin Wendell crumb.

1199
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:25,465
Kevin Wendell crumb!

1200
01:33:36,477 --> 01:33:39,112
Woman:
<i>Kevin Wendell crumb.</i>

1201
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:42,549
Kevin Wendell crumb...

1202
01:33:42,551 --> 01:33:44,617
You made a mess.

1203
01:33:45,986 --> 01:33:47,887
Come out here.

1204
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:51,658
Kevin Wendell crumb!

1205
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:53,326
You made a mess!

1206
01:33:53,328 --> 01:33:54,794
Get out here!

1207
01:34:20,755 --> 01:34:23,356
Who are you?

1208
01:34:23,358 --> 01:34:25,291
Wh-what's happening?

1209
01:34:27,294 --> 01:34:29,429
Something horrible.

1210
01:34:31,432 --> 01:34:33,266
What'd I do?

1211
01:34:34,535 --> 01:34:36,102
Did I hurt you?

1212
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:47,781
Dr. Fletcher. Dr. Fletcher.

1213
01:34:49,784 --> 01:34:51,551
Who did that?

1214
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:55,221
You did.

1215
01:34:55,223 --> 01:34:57,657
I swear I was on a bus.

1216
01:34:57,659 --> 01:34:59,993
I don't remember anything
after that.

1217
01:34:59,995 --> 01:35:02,395
I...

1218
01:35:02,397 --> 01:35:06,332
This is still
September 18, 2014, right?

1219
01:35:16,244 --> 01:35:18,244
There's a shotgun I bought.

1220
01:35:18,246 --> 01:35:22,115
It's in the bottom cabinet,
hidden behind things.

1221
01:35:22,117 --> 01:35:24,017
The shells are in
my uniform closet

1222
01:35:24,019 --> 01:35:25,852
out in the service hall.

1223
01:35:28,622 --> 01:35:30,223
Kill me.

1224
01:35:33,494 --> 01:35:35,328
Then kill me.

1225
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:42,702
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, no!

1226
01:35:42,704 --> 01:35:43,770
Don't do that. Don't do that.

1227
01:35:43,772 --> 01:35:45,104
He can't handle reality.

1228
01:35:45,106 --> 01:35:46,639
My name is Jade.

1229
01:35:46,641 --> 01:35:49,008
Has Dr. Fletcher
been getting our e-mails?

1230
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:50,677
This is what we have to do.
We can...

1231
01:35:50,679 --> 01:35:53,613
As in 1008,

1232
01:35:53,615 --> 01:35:57,617
when Anandapala suffered the
Shahis' most crushing defeat

1233
01:35:57,619 --> 01:36:01,120
and Mahmud overran the entirety
of the Punjab region,

1234
01:36:01,122 --> 01:36:03,823
taking the famed temple
of Kangra,

1235
01:36:03,825 --> 01:36:06,659
we have been wronged
by this alliance,

1236
01:36:06,661 --> 01:36:09,863
this horde of Patricia,
Dennis and the boy.

1237
01:36:09,865 --> 01:36:12,665
Their actions
do not represent us.

1238
01:36:12,667 --> 01:36:15,168
They... are every...

1239
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:18,137
Everybody, just take a minute!

1240
01:36:18,139 --> 01:36:20,874
Oh, baby girl.

1241
01:36:20,876 --> 01:36:23,076
They've been stealing control
of the light from me,

1242
01:36:23,078 --> 01:36:25,812
but the group are gonna work
through this.

1243
01:36:25,814 --> 01:36:28,081
Honey, my name is Barry.

1244
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:40,660
Hedwig: You shouldn't have used
the walkie-talkies.

1245
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:45,832
They almost caught us.

1246
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:49,035
Stop it, Hedwig.

1247
01:36:49,037 --> 01:36:51,604
Oh, they were right.
Look at you.

1248
01:36:51,606 --> 01:36:53,606
You're so frightened of us.

1249
01:36:55,911 --> 01:36:59,412
Dennis and miss Patricia
are in charge because of me.

1250
01:36:59,414 --> 01:37:02,282
I'm gonna give the light
to them now.

1251
01:37:02,284 --> 01:37:06,953
No one's allowed
to make fun of me anymore.

1252
01:37:18,866 --> 01:37:21,534
Patricia:
Thank you, Hedwig.

1253
01:37:25,806 --> 01:37:27,440
Everything's fine now.

1254
01:37:27,442 --> 01:37:29,542
Kevin Wendell crumb.

1255
01:37:31,612 --> 01:37:33,446
Kevin is asleep.

1256
01:37:33,448 --> 01:37:35,615
We've made him sleep far away.

1257
01:37:35,617 --> 01:37:38,151
You can call his name
all you like, dear, but...

1258
01:37:38,153 --> 01:37:41,087
He's not going to hear you.

1259
01:37:41,089 --> 01:37:44,424
The beast has shared
with us his dream

1260
01:37:44,426 --> 01:37:47,727
of a larger group
to sustain him.

1261
01:37:47,729 --> 01:37:49,329
No.

1262
01:37:49,331 --> 01:37:52,999
Ten to twelve unworthy young
next time.

1263
01:37:53,001 --> 01:37:54,767
No. No...

1264
01:37:54,769 --> 01:37:59,105
This is just the start.

1265
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:03,509
No. No.

1266
01:38:17,959 --> 01:38:19,592
Okay. Okay.

1267
01:39:18,987 --> 01:39:20,286
Let go!

1268
01:39:55,289 --> 01:39:57,423
Help!

1269
01:39:58,892 --> 01:40:01,861
No! No!

1270
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,534
No.

1271
01:40:23,283 --> 01:40:26,252
It runs in our family.

1272
01:40:26,254 --> 01:40:28,721
My daddy died, too.

1273
01:40:28,723 --> 01:40:32,058
Same way... heart attack.

1274
01:40:34,561 --> 01:40:36,229
But you don't need to worry.

1275
01:40:36,231 --> 01:40:38,464
I'm going to take care of you.

1276
01:40:41,768 --> 01:40:43,769
Now...

1277
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:46,906
You won't be giving me
any trouble, will you?

1278
01:40:46,908 --> 01:40:49,876
John:
<i>I know you won't, sweetie.</i>

1279
01:41:10,365 --> 01:41:14,867
Beast:
We are glorious!

1280
01:41:14,869 --> 01:41:19,105
We will no longer be afraid!

1281
01:41:28,215 --> 01:41:32,618
Only through pain...

1282
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:35,087
Can you achieve your greatness!

1283
01:41:51,471 --> 01:41:55,908
The impure are the untouched,

1284
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:59,912
the unburned, the unslain.

1285
01:42:02,482 --> 01:42:05,751
Those who have not been torn

1286
01:42:05,753 --> 01:42:09,021
have no value in themselves

1287
01:42:09,023 --> 01:42:13,326
and no place in this world.

1288
01:42:13,328 --> 01:42:16,562
They are asleep.

1289
01:42:20,834 --> 01:42:22,268
All right...

1290
01:42:38,052 --> 01:42:41,754
Your gun cannot hurt me.

1291
01:42:43,056 --> 01:42:46,626
Can't you see I am not human?

1292
01:42:48,528 --> 01:42:50,296
Kevin is a man.

1293
01:42:50,298 --> 01:42:52,531
I am much more.

1294
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:27,760
You... y-you are
different from the rest.

1295
01:44:37,637 --> 01:44:42,675
Your heart is pure.

1296
01:44:42,677 --> 01:44:46,112
Rejoice!

1297
01:44:50,984 --> 01:44:55,054
The broken are the more evolved.

1298
01:45:00,827 --> 01:45:03,629
Rejoice.

1299
01:46:04,124 --> 01:46:06,792
What in the name
of Mary and Joseph?

1300
01:46:08,094 --> 01:46:10,196
What are you doing in this area?

1301
01:46:50,972 --> 01:46:53,439
Just keep walking, honey.

1302
01:46:53,441 --> 01:46:55,407
They won't do nothing.

1303
01:47:30,377 --> 01:47:33,746
Vince, call the police.

1304
01:47:33,748 --> 01:47:37,416
She said some people got hurt
in the area below maintenance.

1305
01:47:58,171 --> 01:48:00,005
Okay.

1306
01:48:02,243 --> 01:48:04,310
Now, I'm just gonna check you.

1307
01:48:45,385 --> 01:48:48,120
Man: Third deceased...
Name of Dr. Karen Fletcher.

1308
01:48:48,122 --> 01:48:50,389
Still trying
to locate the family.

1309
01:49:07,674 --> 01:49:10,009
Woman:
Casey Cooke's guardian's here.

1310
01:49:20,153 --> 01:49:22,154
Your uncle's here.

1311
01:49:23,590 --> 01:49:25,357
You ready to go?

1312
01:50:14,841 --> 01:50:16,775
Dennis:
It didn't go through.

1313
01:50:21,748 --> 01:50:25,651
We are what we believe we are.

1314
01:50:31,225 --> 01:50:33,592
Hedwig:
Holy shit.

1315
01:50:33,594 --> 01:50:36,195
This is so cool!

1316
01:50:36,197 --> 01:50:39,665
Ah!

1317
01:50:39,667 --> 01:50:42,801
They're gonna believe
we exist now, right?

1318
01:50:45,038 --> 01:50:46,739
Dennis:
They're gonna have to.

1319
01:50:49,275 --> 01:50:51,477
Hedwig:
So what do we do now?

1320
01:50:54,914 --> 01:50:56,682
Patricia:
We trust in him.

1321
01:50:58,952 --> 01:51:00,786
He'll protect us.

1322
01:51:02,055 --> 01:51:04,022
Look...

1323
01:51:04,024 --> 01:51:05,958
At what he can do.

1324
01:51:07,627 --> 01:51:11,530
Let him show the world
how powerful we can be.

1325
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:23,308
Female reporter: <i>The suspected
murderer Kevin crumb</i>

1326
01:51:23,310 --> 01:51:27,379
suffers from the controversial
psychological disorder d.I.D.

1327
01:51:27,381 --> 01:51:30,883
The rumors coming out of the
scene are almost unbelievable.

1328
01:51:30,885 --> 01:51:34,486
There are conflicting stories
if the suspect is alive or dead

1329
01:51:34,488 --> 01:51:37,589
after sustaining
two point-blank gunshots.

1330
01:51:37,591 --> 01:51:40,392
Reports even indicate one
of his personalities

1331
01:51:40,394 --> 01:51:42,494
is an amalgam
of the various animals

1332
01:51:42,496 --> 01:51:45,164
in the Philadelphia zoo
where he worked.

1333
01:51:45,166 --> 01:51:46,665
The press is already referring

1334
01:51:46,667 --> 01:51:48,967
to the alleged attacker
by a dark name,

1335
01:51:48,969 --> 01:51:51,637
leaked by a source
close to the case.

1336
01:51:51,639 --> 01:51:53,672
Because of his many
personalities,

1337
01:51:53,674 --> 01:51:56,208
he is being called "the horde."

1338
01:51:57,777 --> 01:51:59,845
This is like that crazy guy
in the wheelchair

1339
01:51:59,847 --> 01:52:02,514
that they put away 15 years ago.

1340
01:52:02,516 --> 01:52:05,984
And they gave him
a funny name, too.

1341
01:52:05,986 --> 01:52:08,086
What was it?

1342
01:52:08,088 --> 01:52:09,521
Mr. glass.

1343
01:52:09,523 --> 01:52:11,223
Oh, yeah.
