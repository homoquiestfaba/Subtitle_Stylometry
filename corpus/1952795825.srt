Kevin Flynn has disappeared.</i>

<i>He was best known for designing Tron

<i>the two bestselling video games

52
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:24,329
<i>Flynn took ownership of ENCO M
in 1 982</i>

53

<i>as the company skyrocketed
to the top of the tech industry.</i>

54
00:04:27,908 --> 00:04:32,208
<i>But things changed in 1 985

<i>This afternoon, ENCO M's board</i>

61

<i>moved to seize control
from Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley,</i>

62
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:53,733
<i>vowing to return the company
to profitability.</i>

63

<i>Loyal to the end, Bradley maintains
his belief that Flynn is not missing</i>

00:15:16,956 --> 00:15:19,322
Enjoy it, Marv. You earned it.

175
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:25,193
Why are you in my apartment, Alan?

176
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,159
You don't answer your phone.

177
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:33,605
-How you been, Sam?
-Oh, you know,

178
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:37,369
when l was 1 2, l appreciated
the surrogate-father thing. But come on.

179
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:40,009
l got it all under control now.

180
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:42,506
Oh. Clearly!

181
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:43,843
You want to help me
with my homework?

182
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:45,415
Like old times? Have a catch?

183
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:51,279
You know,
you got a pretty nice view here.

184
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,261
Heard you did a triple axel off of her
a few hours ago.

185
00:15:58,331 --> 00:16:01,129
-Rough landing, huh?
-Could have been worse.

186
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:04,032
l also thought your message
to the board

187
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,263
was very clever.

188
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:07,839
Did you like that? That was Marv's idea.

189
00:16:13,513 --> 00:16:16,277
Alan, are we really
going to do this again?

190
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,244
Do l really look like l'm ready
to run a Fortune 500 company?

191
00:16:20,753 --> 00:16:21,981
No.

192
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:26,316
And truthfully, the company
is pretty happy with where you are, too.

193
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:27,715
l bet.

194
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,989
That way they can keep doing
whatever they want.

195
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:37,102
You know, l guess what l find curious
is the crazy charities,

196
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,668
the annual prank on the company.

197
00:16:40,073 --> 00:16:42,633
You have an interesting way
of being disinterested, Sam.

198
00:16:42,742 --> 00:16:44,539
Why are you here, Alan?

199
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:49,609
l was paged last night.

200
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:51,944
Oh, man, still rocking the pager?

201
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:53,619
Good for you.

202
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,123
Yeah, your dad once told me
l had to sleep with it, and l still do.

203
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:01,623
Page came from your dad's office
at the arcade.

204
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:07,764
-So?
-So?

205
00:17:08,968 --> 00:17:11,562
That number's been disconnected
for 20 years.

206
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:16,533
Sam, two nights before he disappeared,
he came to my house.

207
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:19,303
''l've cracked it,'' he kept saying.

208
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:23,178
He was talking about genetic
algorithms, quantum teleportation.

209
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,547
He said he was about to change
everything. Science, medicine, religion.

210
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:31,152
He wouldn't have left that, Sam.

211
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:35,558
He wouldn't have left you.

212
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:39,289
Oh, Alan. You're the only one
who still believes that.

213
00:17:39,632 --> 00:17:42,465
He's either dead
or chilling in Costa Rica.

214
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:45,094
Probably both.

215
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:47,305
Look, l'm sorry.

216
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:49,898
l'm tired, and l smell like jail.

217
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:54,943
Let's just reconvene in another couple
of years, huh? What do you say?

218
00:17:58,985 --> 00:18:00,145
Here.

219
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:03,753
These are the keys to the arcade.

220
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:09,618
l haven't gone over there yet.
l thought you should be the one.

221
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:13,096
Alan, you're acting like l'm goanna
find him sitting there working.

222
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:17,032
Just, ''Hey, kiddo. Lost track of time.''

223
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:22,666
Wouldn't that be something?

224
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,475
-What?

225
00:21:49,449 --> 00:21:51,110

Same thing l'm going to do to you, user.

354
00:38:58,176 --> 00:39:00,838
-Greetings, programs.

355
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:07,143
Oh, what an occasion
we have here before us.

356
00:39:07,752 --> 00:39:11,620
Because your rumours are true.

357
00:39:11,723 --> 00:39:16,524
We do indeed have in our midst

358
00:39:16,628 --> 00:39:18,721
a user!

359
00:39:20,932 --> 00:39:23,628
A user.

360
00:39:26,004 --> 00:39:28,234
So, what to do?

361
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,602
What does this user deserve?

362
00:39:33,712 --> 00:39:36,044
Might l suggest perhaps
the challenge of the Grid?

363
00:39:43,221 --> 00:39:48,158
And who best to battle
this singular opponent?

364
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:53,624
Perhaps one who has some
experience in these matters.

365
00:39:56,968 --> 00:39:58,765
Oh, yes, indeed, programs.

366
00:39:59,671 --> 00:40:02,162
Your liberator!

367
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,866
Your luminary!

368
00:40:05,377 --> 00:40:07,106
Your leader and maker!

369
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,407
The one who vanquished
the tyranny of the user

370
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:15,847
those many cycles before!

371
00:40:16,888 --> 00:40:19,413
CLU: l've been waiting
a long time for this.

372
00:40:19,524 --> 00:40:23,085
Jarvis: Clu!

373
00:40:23,228 --> 00:40:26,356
You wanna play? l'll play.

374
00:40:32,704 --> 00:40:34,035
Excellent words, sir.

375
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:37,603
Were you pleased with my execution?

376
00:40:37,742 --> 00:40:40,472
The crowd seemed quite energized.

377
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:44,140
CLU: it wasn't meant for them.

378
00:40:57,128 --> 00:40:58,993
What's this?

379
00:40:59,097 --> 00:41:00,894
What do l do with this?

380
00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:03,058
l'll give you a hint.

381
00:41:03,902 --> 00:41:05,335
Not that.

382
00:41:15,213 --> 00:41:16,703
<i>COMPUTER: Grid is live.</i>

383
00:41:16,815 --> 00:41:20,251

<i>Their bikes are faster than ours.

386
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,203
Now this l can do.

387
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:21,044
Here we go.

388
00:43:27,045 --> 00:43:28,478
Come on. Come on!

389
00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:47,798
Hey! We gotta work together.

390
00:43:47,899 --> 00:43:49,890
it’s the only way.

391
00:43:57,976 --> 00:44:00,501
That's it. You got me.

392
00:44:08,453 --> 00:44:09,818
Boo!

393
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:14,188
-Whoo-hoo!
-Yeah!

394
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:16,419
Now that's what l'm talking about.

395
00:44:16,728 --> 00:44:19,219
Another customer. Let's go!

396
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:38,214
Hang on, buddy, l'm coming.

397
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:48,484
Come on.

Get in.

400
00:45:37,709 --> 00:45:39,233
<i>illegal combatant on the Grid.</i>

401
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:40,504
Get in!

402
00:45:46,684 --> 00:45:49,915
<i>System failure. Release Rinzler.</i>

403
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:51,989

00:46:01,266 --> 00:46:04,497
<i>-Who are you?
-Hang on.</i>

405
00:46:32,497 --> 00:46:34,021

00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:46,007
<i>Driver: Made it.</i>

407
00:46:55,086 --> 00:46:56,280
l'm Quorra.

408
00:47:01,793 --> 00:47:02,987
They're turning around.

409
00:47:03,094 --> 00:47:04,459
Not by choice.

410
00:47:04,562 --> 00:47:08,123
Their vehicles can't go off Grid.
They'll malfunction on this terrain.

411
00:47:08,232 --> 00:47:11,599
-What about us?
- Obviously not.

412
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,111
-Where are you taking me?
-Patience, Sam Flynn.

413
00:47:22,947 --> 00:47:25,780
All your questions
will be answered soon.

414
00:47:34,258 --> 00:47:35,850
SAM: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

415
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,849
Wait here.

416
00:48:44,195 --> 00:48:45,628
MAN: Quorra.

417
00:48:46,697 --> 00:48:48,665
l dreamed of Tron.

418
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,792
First time in years.

419
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:53,895
QUORRA: it’s a sign.

420
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:58,572
MAN: A sign, my dear apprentice,
of a weary soul.

421
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:02,941
MAN: l'm afraid something's happened.
QUORRA: Something has happened.

422
00:49:04,282 --> 00:49:05,840
We have a guest.

423
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:09,809
MAN: There are no guests, kiddo.

424
00:49:33,444 --> 00:49:35,469
Sam...

425
00:49:36,547 --> 00:49:38,879
SAM: Long time.

426
00:49:40,384 --> 00:49:43,217
You have no idea.

427
00:49:48,993 --> 00:49:51,553
You're... You're here.

428
00:49:55,666 --> 00:49:57,099
You're here.

429
00:49:58,002 --> 00:50:00,402
l'm here.

430
00:50:08,012 --> 00:50:09,536
You're big.

431
00:50:10,982 --> 00:50:12,779
You're...

432
00:50:13,518 --> 00:50:14,849
Old.

433
00:50:18,556 --> 00:50:20,820
Kevin: How did you get here?

434
00:50:20,925 --> 00:50:23,393
Alan came over.

435
00:50:24,128 --> 00:50:25,857
Bradley.

436
00:50:25,963 --> 00:50:28,761
Yeah. He got your page.

437
00:50:28,866 --> 00:50:32,131
l found your office under the arcade.

438
00:50:33,538 --> 00:50:35,005
Page...

439
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,402
Oh, the page.

440
00:50:38,743 --> 00:50:40,335
Of course.

441
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:46,508
Clu had him on the light cycle grid.

442
00:50:46,617 --> 00:50:48,744
l intervened.

443
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,444
Oh.

444
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:53,579
Dinner soon.

445
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,959
We'll talk then.

446
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:14,139
He never thought he'd see you again.

447
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,041
Yeah.

448
00:51:25,223 --> 00:51:29,557
Vintage. Flynn built it
many cycles ago for the games.

449
00:51:30,628 --> 00:51:33,495
QUORRA: it doesn't get out
as much as it used to,

450
00:51:33,598 --> 00:51:36,567
but it's still the fastest thing on the Grid.

451
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:01,114
QUORRA: Do you know it?

452
00:52:02,126 --> 00:52:07,189
His patience usually beats out
my more aggressive strategy.

453
00:52:11,535 --> 00:52:13,833
Flynn shared them with me.

454
00:52:13,938 --> 00:52:15,735
l've read them all.

455
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,636
Oh. Light reading.

456
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,137
Tolstoy.

457
00:52:21,245 --> 00:52:23,440
Dostoyevsky.

458
00:52:23,547 --> 00:52:26,072
<i>l-Ching. Journey Without Goal.</i>

459
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,350
Must have a killer ending.

460
00:52:29,453 --> 00:52:31,614
Flynn is teaching me
about the art of the selfless,

461
00:52:31,722 --> 00:52:36,421
about removing oneself
from the equation.

462
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:41,328
But between you and me,
Jules Verne is my favourite.

463
00:52:42,533 --> 00:52:45,024
-Do you know Jules Verne?
-Sure.

464
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,595
What's he like?

465
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,415
Your move, Flynn, come on.

466
00:53:01,352 --> 00:53:03,843
Come on!

467
00:53:25,543 --> 00:53:29,843
QUORRA: How old are you now, Sam?
Kevin: You should be 2 7.

468
00:53:30,915 --> 00:53:32,883
SAM: Yes, 2 7.

469
00:53:32,983 --> 00:53:36,384
QUORRA: Do you attend a college?
SAM: Caltech.

470
00:53:37,755 --> 00:53:41,521
Caltech. My alma mater.

471
00:53:41,625 --> 00:53:42,922
SAM: Yeah.

472
00:53:43,027 --> 00:53:44,654
Till l dropped out.

473
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,265
Work?

474
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,738
-Kevin: Job? ENCOM? Are you...
-No.

475
00:54:01,045 --> 00:54:03,411
l check in once a year.

476
00:54:04,815 --> 00:54:06,942
-Wife, girlfriend?
-Dog.

477
00:54:07,451 --> 00:54:09,783
Marvin.

478
00:54:09,887 --> 00:54:11,980
-A rescue.
-Kevin: Well, dogs...

479
00:54:12,089 --> 00:54:13,818
Dogs are cool.

480
00:54:22,867 --> 00:54:26,803
l'm sure you must have
a few questions of your own, Sam.

481
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,165
Actually, just one.

482
00:54:34,545 --> 00:54:36,536
Why l never came home.

483
00:54:40,418 --> 00:54:43,148
Those nights when l went to the office,

484
00:54:43,254 --> 00:54:46,553
l'm sure you've figured it out by now,
l was coming here.

485
00:54:47,691 --> 00:54:50,489
Human form into digital space.

486
00:54:50,594 --> 00:54:52,619
Heavy stuff.

487
00:54:54,632 --> 00:54:56,827
But l also had you.

488
00:54:56,934 --> 00:55:00,370
l had ENCOM.
l couldn't be in here all the time.

489
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:03,167
l needed partners to help out.

490
00:55:03,274 --> 00:55:04,935
Tron and Clu?

491
00:55:05,776 --> 00:55:06,902
That's right.

492
00:55:09,613 --> 00:55:13,049
<i>Kevin: Tron was created by Alan
for the old system.</i>

493
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,277
<i>l brought him here to protect this one.</i>

494
00:55:15,386 --> 00:55:17,616
<i>Clu was my creation.</i>

495
00:55:17,721 --> 00:55:21,521
<i>A program designed
to create a perfect world.</i>

496
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:25,425
We were jamming, man,
building utopia.

497
00:55:25,529 --> 00:55:28,020
Hours in here
were just minutes back home.

498
00:55:28,132 --> 00:55:30,896
Just when l thought
it couldn't get any more profound,

499
00:55:31,001 --> 00:55:33,162
something unexpected happened.

500
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:35,066
The miracle.

501
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,740
The miracle.

502
00:55:37,842 --> 00:55:39,469
You remember.

503
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:43,974
lSOs. isomorphic algorithms.

504
00:55:44,815 --> 00:55:48,512
-A whole new life form.
-And you created them?

505
00:55:53,157 --> 00:55:54,590
No. No.

506
00:55:54,692 --> 00:55:58,253
They manifested, like a flame.

507
00:55:58,362 --> 00:56:01,263
They weren't really from anywhere.

508
00:56:01,365 --> 00:56:04,232
The conditions were right
and they came into being.

509
00:56:05,302 --> 00:56:09,136
<i>For centuries we've dreamed
of gods, spirits, aliens,</i>

510
00:56:09,273 --> 00:56:11,264
<i>an intelligence beyond our own.</i>

511
00:56:11,375 --> 00:56:12,672
You seeing this?

512
00:56:12,776 --> 00:56:17,406
<i>l found them in here.
Like flowers in a wasteland.</i>

513
00:56:20,351 --> 00:56:22,876
<i>Profoundly naive.</i>

514
00:56:24,622 --> 00:56:27,352
<i>Unimaginably wise.</i>

515
00:56:29,059 --> 00:56:31,254
They were spectacular.

516
00:56:31,362 --> 00:56:34,160
Everything l'd hoped to find
in the system,

517
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,756
control, order, perfection,

518
00:56:36,867 --> 00:56:38,232
none of it meant a thing.

519
00:56:38,335 --> 00:56:39,597
l'd been living in a hall of mirrors.

520
00:56:40,638 --> 00:56:43,300
The lSOs shattered it.

521
00:56:43,407 --> 00:56:46,968
The possibilities of their root code,
their digital DNA.

522
00:56:47,077 --> 00:56:49,477
Disease? History.

523
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:51,908
Science, philosophy,

524
00:56:52,016 --> 00:56:56,214
every idea man has ever had
about the universe up for grabs.

525
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,118
Bio-digital jazz, man.

526
00:56:59,924 --> 00:57:03,451
<i>The lS Os, they were going
to be my gift to the world.</i>

527
00:57:03,561 --> 00:57:05,893
<i>SAM: So what happened?</i>

528
00:57:05,996 --> 00:57:09,432
Kevin: Clu. Clu happened.

529
00:57:12,636 --> 00:57:15,400
TRON: Your transport to the portal
is waiting for you.

530
00:57:15,506 --> 00:57:17,633
l don't like it when you cut it this close.

531
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:21,768
Kevin: Will you stop worrying, Tron?
Everything's just fine.

532
00:57:21,879 --> 00:57:24,006
-Everything's under control.
-CLU: Flynn!

533
00:57:28,819 --> 00:57:31,379
Am l still to create the perfect system?

534
00:57:32,957 --> 00:57:34,515
Yeah.

535
00:57:37,928 --> 00:57:39,020
<i>Kevin: it was a coup.</i>

536
00:57:41,498 --> 00:57:42,487
TRON: Go.

537
00:57:57,114 --> 00:57:58,604
<i>CLU: You've been corrupted.</i>

538
00:58:08,692 --> 00:58:11,525
Why? Why?

539
00:58:14,264 --> 00:58:15,356
Flynn, go!

540
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:25,608
<i>Kevin: Tron, he fought for me.</i>

541
00:58:27,077 --> 00:58:29,341
<i>l never saw him again.</i>

542
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,841
So why didn't you fight?

543
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:34,340
-Kevin: Hmm.
-He did.

544
00:58:34,451 --> 00:58:36,214
Kevin: Clu fed on my resistance.

545
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,016
The more l fought,
the more powerful he became.

546
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,820
it was impressive, really.

547
00:58:42,426 --> 00:58:47,295
<i>And my miracle...
Clu saw the lS Os as an imperfection.</i>

548
00:58:47,931 --> 00:58:49,865
<i>So he destroyed them.</i>

549
00:58:53,103 --> 00:58:54,798
The Purge.

550
00:58:55,305 --> 00:58:59,298
-He killed them all?
-it was genocide.

551
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:03,505
<i>l tried to get back
but l couldn't get to the portal.</i>

552
00:59:04,081 --> 00:59:08,518
<i>it uses massive power
and it can't stay open forever.</i>

553
00:59:09,319 --> 00:59:11,617
<i>And like a safe, it...</i>

554
00:59:11,722 --> 00:59:14,486
<i>it can only be opened from the outside.</i>

555
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,258
it closed on me, Sam.

556
00:59:19,863 --> 00:59:22,229
That's why l never came home.

557
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:31,400
SAM: So the portal, it activated

558
00:59:31,508 --> 00:59:34,272
when l came in. So it's open now.

559
00:59:34,378 --> 00:59:35,367
Kevin: Not for long.

560
00:59:35,479 --> 00:59:38,073
Only one millicycle, about eight hours.

561
00:59:38,182 --> 00:59:41,549
So we go now. Go home.
We make a run for it.

562
00:59:41,652 --> 00:59:43,779
-We get you out of here.
-Don't rush.

563
00:59:43,887 --> 00:59:46,048
What do you mean?
The portal's goanna close.

564
00:59:48,258 --> 00:59:49,850
What? What is it?

565
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:54,021
The moment Flynn is on the Grid, Clu
will stop at nothing to obtain his disk.

566
00:59:54,131 --> 00:59:56,190
My disk is everything, Sam.

567
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,736
it’s the master key. The golden ticket.
The way out.

568
01:00:00,871 --> 01:00:04,363
-And not just for me.
-What do you mean?

569
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:07,171
Our worlds are more connected
than anyone knows.

570
01:00:07,277 --> 01:00:09,472
Clu figures if l can be in...

571
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,241
SAM: He can be out?

572
01:00:11,348 --> 01:00:14,909
Kevin: With my disk, it's possible.
SAM: And then what?

573
01:00:15,552 --> 01:00:17,281
Game over.

574
01:00:18,122 --> 01:00:20,920
The guy doesn't dig imperfection.

575
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:24,927
What's more imperfect than our world?

576
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,796
l can't let that happen. l won't.

577
01:00:30,267 --> 01:00:33,430
So what do we do? Nothing?

578
01:00:33,537 --> 01:00:36,472
it’s amazing how productive
doing nothing can be.

579
01:00:36,573 --> 01:00:40,168
Clu's planning something.
We've known that for a while.

580
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:41,942
Programs have been disappearing.

581
01:00:42,045 --> 01:00:44,673
There's unrest out there,
even revolution.

582
01:00:44,782 --> 01:00:48,980
lf we sit tight, Clu might
be brought down from the inside.

583
01:00:49,086 --> 01:00:52,385
SAM: lf the portal is closing, we can't
sit around. We have to move now.

584
01:00:52,489 --> 01:00:57,290
Tell me, what brought you here,
to the Grid?

585
01:00:57,828 --> 01:00:59,693
Alan got your page.

586
01:00:59,797 --> 01:01:02,527
l didn't send any page.

587
01:01:03,033 --> 01:01:04,261
it was Clu.

588
01:01:04,368 --> 01:01:07,235
Clu sent that page.
That's why you're here.

589
01:01:07,337 --> 01:01:10,306
This is all his design.
He wanted a new piece

590
01:01:10,407 --> 01:01:12,841
on the board to change the game!

591
01:01:12,943 --> 01:01:15,002
With you, he got more
than he ever dreamed.

592
01:01:15,112 --> 01:01:20,243
This is precisely what he wants.
Us together heading for the portal.

593
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:24,480
it’s his game now.
The only way to win is not to play.

594
01:01:26,523 --> 01:01:28,423
Well, that's a hell of a way to live.

595
01:01:28,525 --> 01:01:30,083
But it is a way.

596
01:01:34,898 --> 01:01:36,729
We can go home.

597
01:01:38,635 --> 01:01:40,569
Don't you want that?

598
01:01:41,238 --> 01:01:46,733
Sometimes life has a way of moving you
past things like wants and hopes.

599
01:01:47,477 --> 01:01:52,176
That's great, Dad.
Keep telling yourself that.

600
01:01:57,855 --> 01:01:59,015
Good night, Sam.

601
01:02:22,279 --> 01:02:24,577
How can he be so afraid
of his own creation?

602
01:02:24,681 --> 01:02:27,844
l mean, he built Clu.
Why doesn't he just end him?

603
01:02:29,152 --> 01:02:31,211
He could,
but it would require reintegration.

604
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:32,788
Yeah, all right.

605
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:36,553
Flynn would never survive the event.
it would mean the end of them both.

606
01:02:36,994 --> 01:02:40,293
lf he refuses to save himself,
then l will.

607
01:02:44,501 --> 01:02:46,162
How?

608
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:48,738
l'm going through the portal.

609
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:50,568
Clu wants Flynn's disk, not mine.

610
01:02:50,674 --> 01:02:55,270
l'm going to find Alan and we'll figure
this thing out from the other side.

611
01:02:55,379 --> 01:02:58,815
This may be Clu's game here, but
in my world, he's gone in one keystroke.

612
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:02,181
But l can't do anything
unless l get to the portal.

613
01:03:03,587 --> 01:03:04,645
And my guts tell me

614
01:03:04,755 --> 01:03:08,782
that you don't want to be stuck
in this place for eternity either.

615
01:03:10,994 --> 01:03:14,760
l really think you should consider
your father's wisdom.

616
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:17,429
l have.

617
01:04:21,098 --> 01:04:22,998
There's someone l once knew,

618
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,194
a program named Zuse
who fought alongside the lSOs.

619
01:04:26,303 --> 01:04:29,568
They say he can get anyone anywhere.

620
01:04:31,308 --> 01:04:33,276
SAM: How do l find him?

621
01:04:36,246 --> 01:04:38,077
QUORRA: This is his sector.

622
01:04:41,418 --> 01:04:44,410
Make it there alive, and he'll find you.

623
01:05:25,162 --> 01:05:26,754
Sam?

624
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,629
Sam?

625
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,702
<i>COMPUTER: All programs are required
to present identity disks</i>

626
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:09,271
<i>at city checkpoints.</i>

627
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:16,135
Hey, man. it’s your lucky day.

628
01:06:23,086 --> 01:06:26,180
<i>-Any program without their disk...
-Stop him!</i>

629
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:28,655
<i>...will be taken into custody.</i>

01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:35,263
<i>Any program in violation of their

631
01:06:35,832 --> 01:06:39,268
FEMALE Voice: Sam Flynn?
You remember me?

632
01:06:39,636 --> 01:06:43,572
-Yeah. You gave me some advice.
-And you followed it.

633
01:06:45,041 --> 01:06:47,669
it’s unfortunate we met the way we did.

634
01:06:49,012 --> 01:06:50,343
You have a good night.

635
01:06:50,447 --> 01:06:52,938
You're looking for someone.

636
01:06:55,585 --> 01:06:57,553
What makes you say that?

637
01:06:58,455 --> 01:07:00,423
intuition.

638
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:06,691
Sir, the sentries downtown
have recovered Flynn's light cycle.

639
01:07:08,031 --> 01:07:11,330
We've traced it to its point of origin.

640
01:07:36,293 --> 01:07:39,194
Kevin: Prepare the light runner,
Quorra.

641
01:07:39,896 --> 01:07:42,421
We're going downtown.

642
01:08:04,821 --> 01:08:06,550
Thank you for bringing my son to me.

643
01:08:06,656 --> 01:08:07,884
QUORRA: Flynn!

644
01:08:07,991 --> 01:08:10,926
You don't need to go.
l've sent him to someone we can trust.

645
01:08:11,027 --> 01:08:13,120
Quorra, there is no choice.

646
01:08:14,064 --> 01:08:16,191
l won't lose him again.

647
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:21,398
Chaos. Good news.

648
01:09:02,612 --> 01:09:05,376
Relax. They're occupied.

649
01:09:12,088 --> 01:09:15,785
His name is Castor. lf you want to speak
to Zuse, you need to go through him.

650
01:09:15,892 --> 01:09:18,520
CASTOR: Where's your sense of humour,
my friend?

651
01:09:18,628 --> 01:09:21,927
MAN: Programs are disappearing.
Soon none of us will be left.

652
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:24,728
Zuse can unite the factions,
foment revolution.

653
01:09:24,834 --> 01:09:28,270
-Of course Zuse can do these things.
-Grant me an audience.

654
01:09:28,371 --> 01:09:31,568
Your enthusiasm is intoxicating,
my dear Bartik,

655
01:09:31,675 --> 01:09:34,371
but Zuse's time is precious.

656
01:09:34,477 --> 01:09:36,775
We shall see.

657
01:09:38,415 --> 01:09:40,508
l brought your boy Flynn.

658
01:09:40,617 --> 01:09:45,645
lf you'll excuse me for a moment,
l have to attend to something.

659
01:09:45,755 --> 01:09:48,986
But have a drink,
courtesy of the End of Line Club!

660
01:09:49,726 --> 01:09:50,954
it is happening.

661
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:54,224
Come, away from
these primitive functions.

662
01:09:55,465 --> 01:09:57,763
The son of Flynn.

663
01:09:57,867 --> 01:10:02,804
Of all the innumerable possibilities,
he has to walk into mine.

664
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:05,207
Libations

665
01:10:05,308 --> 01:10:08,141
for everybody!

666
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:14,272
l'm Castor, your host.

667
01:10:14,384 --> 01:10:16,909
Provider of any and all entertainments

668
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:19,580
and diversions.

669
01:10:19,689 --> 01:10:20,986
At your service.

670
01:10:23,526 --> 01:10:25,926
l'm looking for Zuse.

671
01:10:26,029 --> 01:10:28,896
indeed. Many are.

672
01:10:28,998 --> 01:10:30,932
Where can l find him?

673
01:10:31,034 --> 01:10:34,993
This, pretty miss, is a conversation
best had behind closed doors.

674
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:38,563
Perhaps we should retire
to my private lounge.

675
01:10:41,277 --> 01:10:44,610
l designed it myself, you know. it’s true.

676
01:10:44,714 --> 01:10:49,117
l'm stepping away for a moment, boys.
Change the scheme, alter the mood.

677
01:10:49,219 --> 01:10:53,986
Electrify the boys and girls
if you'd be so kind.

678
01:10:56,559 --> 01:10:57,958
-Thank you.

679
01:10:58,061 --> 01:11:00,859
Gem. My name is Gem.

680
01:11:42,372 --> 01:11:44,067
Cozy.

681
01:13:04,721 --> 01:13:07,485
-You are Clu.
-l am Clu.

682
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:12,357
-You will create the perfect system.
-l will create the perfect system.

683
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:18,925
Together we're goanna
change the world, man.

684
01:13:46,396 --> 01:13:47,420
Let's move.

685
01:13:49,499 --> 01:13:51,057
CASTOR: Zuse has been around

686
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:53,101
since the earliest days
of the gaming grid.

687
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:57,666
By necessity,
he has to mind all the percentages.

688
01:13:57,774 --> 01:13:59,674
All the angles.

689
01:13:59,776 --> 01:14:01,607
So when do l meet him?

690
01:14:04,247 --> 01:14:07,614
You just did.

691
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:14,888
After the Purge,
l needed to reinvent myself.

692
01:14:14,991 --> 01:14:17,221
Self-preservation, you understand.

693
01:14:22,298 --> 01:14:26,860
Now, what can l do for you?

694
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:31,630
l need to get to the portal.

695
01:14:31,741 --> 01:14:33,208
Well, it's closing quickly,

696
01:14:33,309 --> 01:14:35,937
as l'm sure you're aware.

697
01:14:36,045 --> 01:14:37,535
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

698
01:14:37,647 --> 01:14:39,877
And it's quite the journey.

699
01:14:39,983 --> 01:14:42,747
Beyond the far reaches of the Outlands.

700
01:14:42,852 --> 01:14:47,346
Your father didn't want any programs
slipping out accidentally, did he?

701
01:14:48,758 --> 01:14:53,286
-Can you help me?
-Of course.

702
01:14:53,396 --> 01:14:57,093
But first, as a man who prides himself
on staying well informed,

703
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,691
l must ask who sent you my way.

704
01:15:02,672 --> 01:15:04,833
Her name's Quorra.

705
01:15:04,941 --> 01:15:07,000
Said she met you a long time ago.

706
01:15:07,810 --> 01:15:10,176
indeed she did.

707
01:15:10,279 --> 01:15:12,008
Many cycles ago.

708
01:15:13,049 --> 01:15:15,779
it was a different time.

709
01:15:15,918 --> 01:15:19,752
But we're not here to relive the past.
Let's see about your future, shall we?

710
01:15:19,856 --> 01:15:22,450
We'll have to change your attire

711
01:15:22,558 --> 01:15:25,823
and you'll need a forged disk.
Not easy these days.

712
01:15:25,928 --> 01:15:27,657
And of course you'll need transport

713
01:15:28,731 --> 01:15:31,723
to cross the Sea of Simulation.

714
01:15:42,912 --> 01:15:45,506
This is going to be quite the ride.

715
01:15:58,061 --> 01:15:59,824
l believed in users once before.

716
01:16:01,698 --> 01:16:03,427
Playing all the angles.

717
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:09,232
Resist!

718
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:21,744
The game has changed, son of Flynn!

719
01:16:38,101 --> 01:16:40,535
l met your friend. He's fantastic!

720
01:16:40,636 --> 01:16:44,037
Behold! The son of our maker!

721
01:16:57,854 --> 01:16:59,219
Yeah!

722
01:17:09,132 --> 01:17:10,463
Yeah, yeah!

723
01:17:12,368 --> 01:17:13,596
Yeah, yeah!

724
01:17:50,006 --> 01:17:51,598
Go, go!

725
01:17:57,013 --> 01:17:59,072
Let's split, man.

726
01:18:19,368 --> 01:18:20,335
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

727
01:18:39,055 --> 01:18:41,046
A little help here maybe?

728
01:19:02,411 --> 01:19:03,673
SAM: Your disk.

729
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,738
Dad, it's gone.

730
01:19:06,849 --> 01:19:08,043
it is.

731
01:19:10,986 --> 01:19:12,613
l'm sorry. l know l messed up.

732
01:19:14,823 --> 01:19:15,812
We can go back.

733
01:19:15,925 --> 01:19:18,621
-l can go back.
-No, we stay together.

734
01:19:18,727 --> 01:19:21,719
-Dad, l can do this.
-You've done enough already!

735
01:19:27,069 --> 01:19:29,060
Sam, you're really...

736
01:19:31,807 --> 01:19:34,037
You're messing with my Zen thing, man.

737
01:19:36,645 --> 01:19:37,976
She's stable.

738
01:19:39,148 --> 01:19:42,413
-SAM: So what do we do now?
-l don't know. Nothing.

739
01:19:43,419 --> 01:19:45,353
We do nothing.

740
01:19:45,955 --> 01:19:47,445
Be still.

741
01:19:50,092 --> 01:19:51,684
Wait.

742
01:19:59,468 --> 01:20:02,301
You ever jump a freight train?

743
01:20:03,505 --> 01:20:04,494
Huh?

744
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:07,770
We do it your way.
Full-on sprint to the portal.

745
01:20:07,876 --> 01:20:09,741
lf we beat Clu there, we have a chance.

746
01:20:09,845 --> 01:20:11,142
Let's get her out of here.

747
01:20:30,099 --> 01:20:31,828
This'll take us there.

748
01:20:58,761 --> 01:21:01,229
-ls she goanna make it?
-l don't know.

749
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:03,958
l've got to identify the damaged code.

750
01:21:04,066 --> 01:21:07,593
The sequencing
is just enormously complex.

751
01:21:08,737 --> 01:21:13,401
-SAM: But didn't you write it?
-Some of it. The rest of it is just

752
01:21:16,278 --> 01:21:18,803
beyond me.

753
01:21:20,082 --> 01:21:22,414
She's an lSO.

754
01:21:22,518 --> 01:21:24,918
Kevin: Yeah. The last lSO.

755
01:21:27,256 --> 01:21:28,621
SAM: All this time,

756
01:21:28,724 --> 01:21:31,056
you were just protecting her.

757
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:35,153
Kevin: She's the miracle, man.
Everything l ever worked for.

758
01:21:36,565 --> 01:21:40,797
''A digital frontier
to reshape the human condition.''

759
01:21:40,903 --> 01:21:44,100
SAM: l always thought
that was just a plug line.

760
01:21:44,206 --> 01:21:48,404
Kevin: in our world,
she could change everything.

761
01:21:49,845 --> 01:21:51,938
Yeah.

762
01:21:53,749 --> 01:21:56,149
Check that out.

763
01:22:04,326 --> 01:22:06,419
She risked herself for me.

764
01:22:08,397 --> 01:22:10,695
Some things are worth the risk.

765
01:22:24,313 --> 01:22:26,213
Kevin: Look at this.

766
01:22:29,118 --> 01:22:32,679
Now, that is impressive
if l do say so myself. Huh?

767
01:22:34,156 --> 01:22:37,319
Come on, it's goanna take a while
for her system to reboot.

768
01:22:37,426 --> 01:22:40,589
Now it's time for you to tell me a story.

769
01:22:58,781 --> 01:23:01,045
CLU: The boy and Flynn are gone.

770
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:04,950
CASTOR: l presume, Your Excellency,
they perished in the elevator.

771
01:23:08,457 --> 01:23:09,981
You presume?

772
01:23:12,161 --> 01:23:14,322
Find them.

773
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:22,000
SAM: icecaps are melting,
war in the Middle East,

774
01:23:22,104 --> 01:23:24,231
<i>LakerslCeltics back at it.</i>

775
01:23:25,407 --> 01:23:28,570
l don't know. Rich are getting richer,
poor are getting poorer.

776
01:23:28,677 --> 01:23:31,373
Cell phones, online dating, Wi-Fi.

777
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,540
-Kevin: What's Wi-Fi?
-Wireless interlinking.

778
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:37,483
-Of digital devices?
-Yeah.

779
01:23:37,753 --> 01:23:40,984
Hmm. l thought of that in '85.

780
01:23:45,661 --> 01:23:47,754
Mom and Dad are...

781
01:23:49,531 --> 01:23:51,726
-l assume that...
-Yeah.

782
01:23:52,935 --> 01:23:53,959
Oh.

783
01:23:55,037 --> 01:23:57,369
Mac when l was 1 2

784
01:23:57,473 --> 01:24:00,374
and Gram five years later.

785
01:24:03,178 --> 01:24:07,012
You remember that night
when you didn't come home?

786
01:24:07,115 --> 01:24:08,309
-Well...
-You said...

787
01:24:08,417 --> 01:24:10,476
l said l'd show you the Grid.

788
01:24:12,554 --> 01:24:14,852
You should have seen this place
back then.

789
01:24:15,824 --> 01:24:21,126
l couldn't wait to show it to you.
Could not wait.

790
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:23,721
SAM: Must have been something
before Clu screwed it up.

791
01:24:23,832 --> 01:24:25,527
No, no, he...

792
01:24:27,336 --> 01:24:29,998
He's me. l screwed it up.

793
01:24:31,507 --> 01:24:33,600
Chasing after perfection.

794
01:24:35,711 --> 01:24:39,374
Chasing after
what was right in front of me.

795
01:24:39,982 --> 01:24:41,882
Right in front of me.

796
01:24:43,785 --> 01:24:46,117
Look what you've accomplished.

797
01:24:46,522 --> 01:24:48,285
it’s incredible.

798
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:49,755
Sam,

799
01:24:50,726 --> 01:24:53,991
l'd have given it all up
for one more day with you.

800
01:25:07,142 --> 01:25:08,131
Hey.

801
01:25:08,777 --> 01:25:10,938
Remember your old Ducati?

802
01:25:11,146 --> 01:25:14,309
You kidding? Not a day goes by
l don't think about that bike.

803
01:25:14,449 --> 01:25:18,385
-Yeah, well, l'm fixing her up.
-You busted my bike?

804
01:25:18,487 --> 01:25:24,153
Twenty years in the shed, no tarp.
l mean, she needed a little love.

805
01:25:25,794 --> 01:25:27,318
How does she run?

806
01:25:27,429 --> 01:25:31,388
Well, when l'm done, better than ever.

807
01:25:32,668 --> 01:25:35,159
Well, man, l'd like to see that.

808
01:25:36,838 --> 01:25:38,328
You will.

809
01:25:41,743 --> 01:25:42,767
Here.

810
01:25:43,111 --> 01:25:45,545
She's rebooting. Give her this.

811
01:25:45,647 --> 01:25:49,447
The old man's goanna knock on the sky,
listen to the sound.

812
01:26:15,811 --> 01:26:17,301
CASTOR: When Flynn
entered the space,

813
01:26:17,813 --> 01:26:20,907
ah, everything changed.

814
01:26:21,483 --> 01:26:24,043
l've never seen anything quite like it.

815
01:26:24,653 --> 01:26:27,121
The awe was

816
01:26:28,023 --> 01:26:29,422
palpable.

817
01:26:31,026 --> 01:26:33,256
-Was it?
-l presume

818
01:26:33,929 --> 01:26:37,092
our understanding is still valid?

819
01:26:38,667 --> 01:26:40,760
Control of the city?

820
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:44,339
A sizeable request, l know.

821
01:26:44,439 --> 01:26:47,272
But seemingly fitting compensation.

822
01:26:47,943 --> 01:26:49,308
Don't you think?

823
01:26:50,746 --> 01:26:54,238
How long have you been
searching for this, Clu?

824
01:26:55,417 --> 01:26:57,977
About 1 ,000 cycles. No?

825
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:01,880
Just imagine the secrets it holds.

826
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:07,761
The master key to any and all riddles

827
01:27:08,463 --> 01:27:10,931
of the Grid, Grid, Grid, Grid...

828
01:27:13,835 --> 01:27:15,598
But there's something else, too.

829
01:27:16,204 --> 01:27:17,330
isn’t there?

830
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:19,304
l've heard the chatter

831
01:27:19,408 --> 01:27:22,775
about this private initiative.

832
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:35,346
l realize that our alliance is,

833
01:27:35,457 --> 01:27:36,856
at times,

834
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:38,425
uneasy.

835
01:27:38,527 --> 01:27:40,495
But always necessary.

836
01:27:42,297 --> 01:27:43,924
You know you need me

837
01:27:44,066 --> 01:27:46,034
right where l am.

838
01:27:46,134 --> 01:27:47,567
Clu?

839
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:50,365
Of course you're right.

840
01:27:51,139 --> 01:27:52,902
Enjoy the drink.

841
01:28:00,582 --> 01:28:02,675
End of line, man.

842
01:28:12,327 --> 01:28:15,387
-Hey. it’s okay. We're safe for now.

843
01:28:15,497 --> 01:28:18,091
We're heading east towards the portal.

844
01:28:20,836 --> 01:28:22,701
Clu has the disk.

845
01:28:23,371 --> 01:28:26,238
Once l get out, l can shut him down.

846
01:28:28,376 --> 01:28:31,903
l should never have sent you to Zuse.
it was a mistake.

847
01:28:32,013 --> 01:28:34,481
it’s okay. l've made a few myself.

848
01:28:39,988 --> 01:28:41,580
Where is he?

849
01:28:42,557 --> 01:28:45,390
SAM: l think he's knocking on the sky.

850
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,653
QUORRA: And listening to the sound.

851
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:50,295
Yeah.

852
01:28:50,932 --> 01:28:52,900
How did you find him?

853
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:03,502
it’s okay.

854
01:29:06,314 --> 01:29:07,713
l know.

855
01:29:12,988 --> 01:29:15,286
QUORRA: it was during the Purge.

856
01:29:16,458 --> 01:29:18,392
Clu was relentless.

857
01:29:18,794 --> 01:29:22,127
The Black Guard were executing lSOs
in the streets.

858
01:29:23,298 --> 01:29:26,028
Everyone l knew disappeared.

859
01:29:28,703 --> 01:29:30,728
Then they came for me.

860
01:29:33,508 --> 01:29:35,408
So l ran.

861
01:29:36,511 --> 01:29:39,776
A sympathetic program
smuggled me out of the city.

862
01:29:39,881 --> 01:29:42,372
But soon they had me surrounded.

863
01:29:42,484 --> 01:29:44,475
l prepared for the end.

864
01:29:44,686 --> 01:29:47,018
And just as everything was going dark,

865
01:29:47,656 --> 01:29:50,591
l felt a hand on my shoulder.

866
01:29:53,328 --> 01:29:55,353
And when l opened my eyes,

867
01:29:56,832 --> 01:30:01,201
standing above me was the Creator.

868
01:30:03,872 --> 01:30:05,601
Your father.

869
01:30:07,242 --> 01:30:08,869
He saved me.

870
01:30:13,148 --> 01:30:16,640
l guess you could say l'm a rescue.

871
01:30:35,737 --> 01:30:37,500
SAM: Hell of a view.

872
01:30:37,672 --> 01:30:40,470
QUORRA: it used to let us know
that Flynn was here.

873
01:30:40,575 --> 01:30:42,907
it became the symbol
of something bigger,

874
01:30:43,044 --> 01:30:46,309
something better than this world.

875
01:30:47,115 --> 01:30:49,549
l've never been this close before.

876
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:53,277
it’s how l imagine a sunrise to be.

877
01:30:53,388 --> 01:30:55,686
Ah, trust me. There's no comparison.

878
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,060
What's it like?

879
01:31:03,131 --> 01:31:05,565
-The sun?
-Yeah.

880
01:31:06,468 --> 01:31:08,436
Man...

881
01:31:10,038 --> 01:31:12,632
l've never had to describe it before.

882
01:31:14,676 --> 01:31:15,836
Warm.

883
01:31:17,946 --> 01:31:19,470
Radiant.

884
01:31:22,284 --> 01:31:24,047
Beautiful.

885
01:31:49,711 --> 01:31:52,441
Get below! Move!

886
01:31:54,282 --> 01:31:56,580
This isn't supposed to be here.

887
01:32:00,855 --> 01:32:04,188
-What happened?
-A new course.

888
01:32:15,103 --> 01:32:16,502
What is this?

889
01:32:17,505 --> 01:32:19,097
Clu can't create programs.

890
01:32:19,441 --> 01:32:22,035
He can only destroy or repurpose them.

891
01:32:23,011 --> 01:32:25,536
Repurpose them for what?

892
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:32,784
<i>COMPUTER: Battalion 6,
report to Staging Area Alpha.</i>

893
01:32:35,991 --> 01:32:37,515
He's building an army.

894
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:39,857
Let's go.

895
01:32:39,961 --> 01:32:45,126
<i>COMPUTER: All high-level functions,
report immediately to combat stations.</i>

896
01:33:10,325 --> 01:33:12,589
-Goodbye.
-Quorra!

897
01:33:13,094 --> 01:33:16,086
-What's she doing?
-Removing herself from the equation.

898
01:33:34,215 --> 01:33:35,648
Tron.

899
01:33:37,452 --> 01:33:39,511
Kevin: He's alive.

900
01:33:40,155 --> 01:33:42,623
<i>COMPUTER:
Throne ship is approaching.</i>

901
01:33:45,527 --> 01:33:49,190
-We can't just let her go.
-No, Sam, there's another way.

902
01:33:49,898 --> 01:33:52,298
<i>Throne ship is approaching.</i>

903
01:34:03,545 --> 01:34:05,638
Jarvis: Well done, sir.

904
01:34:19,894 --> 01:34:22,385
Jarvis: l've never seen anything like it.

905
01:34:22,864 --> 01:34:26,493
Humbly, sir, l know
you have greater designs

906
01:34:26,601 --> 01:34:29,161
than any of us understand.

907
01:34:30,371 --> 01:34:31,804
What does it do?

908
01:34:57,699 --> 01:34:59,564
She's goanna wind up like one of them.

909
01:35:00,101 --> 01:35:01,295
Keep moving, Sam.

910
01:35:11,946 --> 01:35:15,746
You are a very rare bird,
aren't you, now?

911
01:35:23,992 --> 01:35:25,721
Where's your disk?

912
01:35:28,329 --> 01:35:30,126
Where is he?

913
01:35:32,066 --> 01:35:34,762
it must have been so lonely out there.

914
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:38,630
How tragic to be the only one.

915
01:35:40,575 --> 01:35:43,442
l've seen what users
are capable of, Clu.

916
01:35:44,279 --> 01:35:46,509
You don't belong with them.

917
01:35:51,686 --> 01:35:54,519
l have something very special
in mind for you.

918
01:35:58,092 --> 01:35:59,650
Take her upstairs.

919
01:36:00,094 --> 01:36:01,823
And find them.

920
01:36:02,564 --> 01:36:07,331
You'll have to excuse me. You arrived
just as l was preparing a little toast.

921
01:36:22,417 --> 01:36:24,351
-Greetings, programs!

922
01:36:28,323 --> 01:36:32,225
Together we have achieved
a great many things.

923
01:36:32,493 --> 01:36:36,452
We have created a vast, complex
system. We've maintained it.

924
01:36:37,799 --> 01:36:40,233
We've improved it.

925
01:36:40,335 --> 01:36:44,237
We have rid it of its imperfection.

926
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,307
Not to mention

927
01:36:47,442 --> 01:36:50,673
rid it of the false deity
who sought to enslave us.

928
01:36:53,081 --> 01:36:55,242
Kevin Flynn!

929
01:36:56,317 --> 01:36:59,115
-Where are you now?

930
01:37:01,856 --> 01:37:05,019
My fellow programs,
let there be no doubt

931
01:37:05,126 --> 01:37:07,651
that our world is a cage no more.

932
01:37:08,129 --> 01:37:12,725
For at this moment,
the key to the next frontier is finally

933
01:37:13,001 --> 01:37:14,525
in our possession!

934
01:37:20,074 --> 01:37:22,008
Your disk.

935
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:23,805
CLU: And unlike our selfish Creator,

936
01:37:23,911 --> 01:37:27,608
who reserved the privilege of our world
only for himself,

937
01:37:27,715 --> 01:37:31,344
l will make their world open

938
01:37:31,486 --> 01:37:33,681
and available to all of us!

939
01:37:36,991 --> 01:37:38,288
Yes!

940
01:37:38,826 --> 01:37:40,453
To all of us!

941
01:37:51,172 --> 01:37:52,571
SAM: He's taking all of this with him.

942
01:37:53,174 --> 01:37:55,005
He's figured out how to do it.

943
01:37:55,109 --> 01:37:57,009
CLU: And whatever we find there,

944
01:37:57,145 --> 01:37:59,272
there our system will grow!

945
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:02,941
There our system will blossom!

946
01:38:04,218 --> 01:38:05,708
Do this.

947
01:38:05,820 --> 01:38:08,448
Prove yourselves.
Prove yourselves to me!

948
01:38:08,556 --> 01:38:10,114
Be loyal to me!

949
01:38:10,658 --> 01:38:13,491
And l will never betray you!

950
01:38:26,074 --> 01:38:27,666
Dad, we have to get your disk.

951
01:38:27,842 --> 01:38:30,572
We gotta get to the portal.
You shut them down outside.

952
01:38:30,678 --> 01:38:33,340
Even if l make it, you won't
last in here, nor will Quorra.

953
01:38:33,448 --> 01:38:36,679
-We'll be all right. Come on.
-l'm not going home without you.

954
01:38:37,819 --> 01:38:39,081
Sam...

955
01:38:39,654 --> 01:38:41,417
The same team.

956
01:38:42,357 --> 01:38:43,722
Remember?

957
01:38:45,893 --> 01:38:47,884
l was afraid you were goanna say that.

958
01:38:48,963 --> 01:38:51,056
Meet me on the flight deck in five
and get us some wheels.

959
01:38:51,165 --> 01:38:53,326
Wheels? What's your plan?

960
01:38:54,202 --> 01:38:56,602
l'm a user. l'll improvise.

961
01:38:58,206 --> 01:39:00,140
CLU: Maximize efficiency.

962
01:39:01,576 --> 01:39:04,443
Rid the new system of its imperfection!

963
01:39:07,048 --> 01:39:10,575
My vision is clear, fellow programs.

964
01:39:11,552 --> 01:39:15,682
Out there is a new world!

965
01:39:16,457 --> 01:39:19,119
Out there is our victory!

966
01:39:20,595 --> 01:39:22,085
Out there

967
01:39:24,198 --> 01:39:26,689
is our destiny.

968
01:40:10,344 --> 01:40:13,006
<i>SENTRY: identify yourself, program.</i>

969
01:40:16,217 --> 01:40:19,277

My name is Sam Flynn.

<i>Watch your step, please,

977

l came with a girl, a program.
Where is she?

978
01:41:29,457 --> 01:41:31,118
Sam! Go!

979
01:41:57,385 --> 01:41:59,717
-Why are you here?
-We gotta get to the flight deck.

980
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:01,082
Clu will be here any minute.

981

-Come on.

01:42:14,402 --> 01:42:17,098

You're goanna need it.

Head towards the light, Quorra.

991
01:44:08,783 --> 01:44:10,580
Where did you learn that move?

992
01:44:10,718 --> 01:44:13,312

993
01:44:15,823 --> 01:44:18,451
ENCOM Tower. Huh.

994
01:44:20,261 --> 01:44:21,455

There it is.

1024
01:49:13,153 --> 01:49:17,385
-Take her down.
-Hang on. This could be rough.

1025
01:50:09,576 --> 01:50:11,771
This is mine.

The cycles
haven't been kind, have they?

1028
01:50:23,957 --> 01:50:26,221
Oh, you don't look so bad.

1029
01:50:27,528 --> 01:50:31,089
l did everything.
Everything you ever asked.

1030
01:50:31,698 --> 01:50:33,427
l know you did.

01:50:33,534 --> 01:50:36,833

l took this system
to its maximum potential.

1036
01:50:49,950 --> 01:50:52,077
l created the perfect system!

1037
01:50:52,186 --> 01:50:55,917
The thing about perfection
is that it's unknowable.

1038
01:50:57,091 --> 01:51:01,687
it’s impossible but it's also
right in front of us all the time.

1039
01:51:01,829 --> 01:51:05,458
You wouldn't know that
because l didn't when l created you.

1041

1047
01:52:11,031 --> 01:52:14,057
And still you did all this? For him.

01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,468
No.

He's my son.
