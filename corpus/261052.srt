1
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,132
You can go.

2
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,047
<i>This is Radio Uganda.</i>

3
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,953
<i>Today, November 7, 1972, is the day</i>
<i>in which the people of Uganda...</i>

4
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:36,186
<i>... are witnessing the end of one chapter</i>
<i>in this country's history...</i>

5
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:38,830
<i>... and the beginning of another.</i>

6
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:42,627
<i>Today, the last of the Asians who have</i>

7

<i>... will have done so</i>
<i>in order to pave the way...</i>

8
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:50,035
<i>... for the indigenous people of Uganda</i>
<i>to control the economy.</i>

9
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,579

10
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,748
...say that Amin was evil.

11
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,013
Are you mad?

12
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,222
What about Kinnu?

13
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:09,393
What about Mina?

14
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:13,430
- Do you ever think of them?
- What should I have done?

15
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,932
Remain silent?

16
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:26,338
- That is the coward's way.
- Don't talk to me about cowards!

17
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,242
That's what you are.

18
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:33,082
You're not leaving
because you're scared to leave.

19
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,719
- You are scared of leaving Uganda.
- Why should I go?

20
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,223
Why should I go?

21
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,787
Okelo, this is my home.

22
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:49,164
Not anymore, Jay.

23
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,672
Africa is for Africans.

24
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:58,104
Black Africans.

25
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,770
I'll be leaving today.

26
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:15,952
Thank God you're back.
Where did they take you?

27
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,688
Did they hurt you?

28
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,460
Speak to me, Jay. Where's Okelo?

29
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,598
Gone home, I suppose.

30
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,475
I just can't think about the house,
what to pack. I just want to go.

31
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,381
- Where are we going, Papa?
- Mina, go to sleep.

32
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:50,010
- But sleep's not coming.
- No one's going anywhere.

33
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,124
- Now, go back to bed.
- <i>Beta.</i>

34
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:57,920
We are leaving very soon.

35
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,328
Are we going where Masuma went?

36
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,093
Maybe.

37
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:08,303
- She said there's snow. Will there be?
- Yes.

38
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,311
Is Okelo <i>chachu</i> coming with us?

39
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:27,508
- Take whatever you want from the house.
- Thank you.

40
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:52,171
Bye. Bye.

41
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,673
Bye. Bye.

42
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,661
When are we coming back home?

43
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,064
I don't know.

44
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,675
Papa?

45
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,079
Are you crying?

46
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:38,654
You said that big people don't cry.

47
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,457
Why do we have to go, Papa?

48
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:59,108
Last day. Last day.
Last day. Last day.

49
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,400
Kinnu.

50
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,643
Okelo.

51
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,047
The car.

52
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,084
I'll sell this.

53
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,396
Mina, come.

54
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:02,463
- What's this? You're taking it with you?
- Can't you come with us?

55
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:08,803
Be a good girl. Look after your parents
and you'd better not forget your Swahili!

56
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,644
But who will speak Swahili
with me over there?

57
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,982
I'll see you soon, okay?

58
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,605
Okelo Uncle...

59
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,011
Thank you.

60
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,864
You. Out of the bus.

61
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:10,662
You stay here. Bring your bags.

62
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:27,548
- What's in your bag?
- Nothing. Just clothes.

63
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,418
Open.

64
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,297
- What's this?
- Music.

65
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,443

Yes, it's enough.

- Afternoon.

- I'll get a ticket if I go any slower.

94
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,334
Drive slowly, Mina.

95
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,077
Do you wanna drive?

96
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:39,051

- It's gonna be all over town tomorrow.

- Hold on, I saw you.

Sears and Roebuck?

- lf you hadn't just stopped...
- What's going on here?

101

- My truck stalled.
- No, your truck stopped in the road!

102
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:59,539
- And you tailgated...
- Keep your voice down!

103
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,339
Your license.

104
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:07,312
- Does anybody need a ride?
- I'm not finished.

105
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,011
Is it against the law
for my truck to stall?

106
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:14,523
- It is to stop in the middle of the road.
- Lf you're barreling...

107
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,856
- What is he talking about?
- Step back.

108
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,162
Told him I'm not afraid.

109
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:25,298
- What's he saying?
- He's saying everything is fine.

110
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:29,567
- Get that black guy's name for insurance.
- I told you, drive slowly.

111
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:33,199
Didn't I tell you to drive slowly?
What will Anil say?

112
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:35,243
I'm really sorry.

113
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:39,180

and address for the insurance.

114

- Yeah. Here's mine.

115

- All right.

I'm telling you, it's not my fault.

117
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:55,191
I ain't finished with you yet,
young lady.

118

to my lawsuit, number 2089...

119

...filed in the high court at Kampala,
dated 30 December 1985...

120
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,814
...for restoration of my property.

121
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:17,288
I was born in Uganda
and Uganda has been my home...

utmost loyalty and love...

...until I was forcibly...

124
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:28,232
...and illegally expelled...

125
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,233
...by General Idi Amin."

126
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,039
Suing the mad government
of a mad country.

127
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,899
It's going to drive you mad.

128
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,445
For five years they haven't replied.

129
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:48,018
- But you carry on like a stuck record.
- Kinnu, it's a new regime.

130
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,815
I know it's a new regime.

131
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,951
So what? Every year it's new.

132
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:58,426
- But nothing...
- Kinnu, Mina had an accident.

133
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,502
- What happened, <i>beta</i>?
- What did you do to my car?

134
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:14,134
- What did you do to my car, Mina?
- Was anyone hurt?

135
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,543
No one was hurt.

136
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,607
- How did it happen?
- Thank God nobody was hurt.

137
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:24,483
What's happened has happened.
No use crying over spilt milk.

138
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:28,319
Who is going to pay for this?
Does money grow on trees over here?

139
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:32,452
Maybe in your fertile Uganda
it used to grow on trees, but not here.

140
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,393
Can't feed his own family
and lecturing about spilt milk.

141
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,765
My father can feed us just fine,
you wanker.

142
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,667
- What did you say?
- Shut your mouth.

143
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,104
Why should I shut my mouth?

144
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:48,303
Hey, my man, I need my money.
Forty bucks.

145
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,545
Y'all gonna need this
for the insurance.

146
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:56,115
See, Napkin, last week I even got
Chanda's name on the license plate.

147
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:59,780
Anilbhai, stop thinking of the car.

148
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,859
From whose pocket is this all
going to come?

149
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,259
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

150
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,025
- You have other problems.
- What?

151
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:13,331
In this country,
all they know is how to sue.

152
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:17,336
You get me?
You know about whiplash?

153
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,502
He'll say, "When she hit my car,
my neck got a...

154
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,205
And my spine is damaged forever...

155
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:29,150
...and so I am suing you
for just one million dollars."

156
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:33,189
- Then what will you do?
- Hey, Pontiac, stop scaring him.

157
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:37,124
- Anil, give me that fellow's card.
- Sure.

158
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:49,472
Your debt is our bread and butter.
This fellow cleans my carpets.

159
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,372
- Mine too. So what?
- So I'll fix it.

160
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,979
- Don't worry.
- You speak to him? Please.

161
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:00,983
Tomorrow. Now, smile.
I want to see you smile.

162
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,486
It's your wedding day, man, come on.
Enjoy!

163
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,783
- Okay?
- All right.

164
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,530
Beautiful.

165
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:22,072
Must you check, Kinnu?
It's not Mina's wedding after all.

166
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:26,077
- I knew it. Go change your slippers.
- Why?

167
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:30,044
- Is he gonna check out my feet also?
- Mina.

168
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:35,619
Face it, Ma, you got a darkie daughter.
Harry's mother doesn't like darkies.

169
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:39,052
Who needs Harry hero-types
in our family?

170
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,520
Want her to be a 30-year-old spinster
running a liquor store?

171
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,459
Why not? You can have a chain.

172
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,826
Go change your slippers.

173
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:52,031
The things I do for you, Ma.

174
00:22:55,207 --> 00:23:00,509
Really, you never say anything to her.
You forget she's a girl.

175
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,809
Can girls behave the way she does?
Spoil her. Spoil her.

176
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:09,311
When she sits on our head,
it'll be your responsibility.

177
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,251
Kinnu.

178
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,782
The accident wasn't her fault.

179
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,565
Man, tell us what happened.

180
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,539
We was in this room
filled with computers and shit.

181
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:38,013
So I go on over to check them out,
you know, start fooling around with them.

182
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:41,949
- Start typing, "Kill the crackers."
- Oh, man.

183
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,022
And all this other stuff, right?
And then I couldn't erase it.

184
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,686
D-Money nearly lynched me.

185
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:54,027
- That's messed up, man.
- Yo, Dex, man. Dex.

186
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,793
There's big brother.
You better haul ass.

187
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:58,128
Okay, y'all, peace.

188
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:01,238
Dex's messed up
his brother's shit, man.

189
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:07,838
- Hey, D-Money.
- Why I always got to come get you?

190
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,680
Why I always got to come get you
off the street corner, man?

191
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:17,185
Daddy wants you home, maybe fix him
something to eat before he get off of work.

192
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,915
That's why I don't take you
on the job with me.

193
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,424
- I can't depend on you. Come on.
- I was getting ready to go.

194
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,120
- Go by the employment office?
- Yeah.

195
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,697
- And?
- I went down...

196
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,494
...and they tell me I'm coming
in there too much.

197
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,365
They tell me veterans come first.

198
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,171
Those crackers always got
some excuse...

199
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,674
That's what I'm talking about.
You always got some excuse.

200
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:43,406
You can stand out here on the corner
with these crackheads...

201
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,415
...but when it's about getting a job,
you got an excuse.

202
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,554
- You can wear these big-ass...
- Hey!

203
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:05,200
- Can I get something for y'all?
- No, thank you.

204
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:16,403
- Gentlemen, did you ring?
- No.

205
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,653
Anything else I can get for you, sir?

206
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,627
Ma'am?

207
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,165
Could you put our bread
in a doggy bag, please?

208
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,703
Certainly, ma'am.

209
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,900
- I'll go inside and wait for my father.
- All right, Demetrius. Take care.

210
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,567
All right.

211
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:56,118
That's Grace's son.
You know, Mrs. Sanders' Grace?

212
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,188
He's the good one.

213
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:02,452
We helped him start his own business.
Clancy, bless his heart.

214
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,994
He spoke to the bank.
You know how they are with references.

215
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,523
Sorry I'm late, Dad.

216
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,462
It don't make no difference.

217
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,569
Thought those two was
never gonna get up and leave.

218
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:23,646
Sat there all night
and forgot to leave a tip.

219
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:27,912
I don't know why you're so stubborn,
working for them slave wages.

220
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,453
What you want me to do?
Sit at home and catch flies?

221
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,490
What you know about
slave wages, anyway?

222
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,562
- Guess who called me tonight?
- Who?

223
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,932
- Alicia.
- Oh, yeah?

224
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,434
Sure was good
to hear her voice again.

225
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:50,166
I invited her to stop by on Sunday.

226
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,040
Daddy, what you do that for?

227
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:59,206
What happened between you
and her is your business.

228
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:02,649
But she always been
a part of this family.

229
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:06,484
She always will be,
so long as I'm alive.

230
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,523
Yes, sir.

231
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,597
- Hi, Mina.
- Hi, Harry.

232
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,264
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

233
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:08,351
That's the mother. Owns a liquor shop.
Can you imagine?

234
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,988
The father's a complete screw-loose.

235
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:14,648
Spends all his time suing the
government of Uganda for his property.

236
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,657
The mother has her eyes on Harry.

237
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:20,797
- But we're trying to get Harry for Namita.
- You think this one has a chance?

238
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:25,163
You can be dark and have money,
or you can be fair and have no money.

239
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:28,100
But you can't be dark
and have no money...

240
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:31,367
...and expect to get Harry Patel.

241
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,908
Brothers, sisters and friends.

242
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,574
On this happy occasion
of my only son's wedding reception...

243
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:42,447
...I would like to say a few words.

244
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,817
Hear, hear! Three cheers for Anil.

245
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,061
Thank you. Thank you.

246
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:58,692
But what I wish to say is
more serious and that is...

247
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:03,307
...even though we are
10,000 miles away from India...

248
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,706
...we should not forget our roots,
our culture...

249
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,177
...our tradition and our gods.

250
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:15,945
So please join me in singing a prayer.

251
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:41,334
What is this? Behave yourself.
Wake up. Everyone's singing.

252
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,185
Wanna go out when this is over?

253
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,286
Okay, let me tell my mother, though.

254
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,156
I have to get out of these clothes.

255
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,632
Ma, Harry's asked me to go out.

256
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,641
They're going out.

257
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:21,315
You wouldn't believe the racket.
It's 10:00. Customers are complaining.

258
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:26,185
- So you better come right on over.
- Send them back to the reservation.

259
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,383
How often I gotta tell you?
They're not that kind of Indian.

260
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:33,226
- This place?
- It's the only place open in your town.

261
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,629
- Wanna give it a shot?
- Sure.

262
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:09,460
Excuse me, two beers, please.
Michelob.

263
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,551
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

264
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:32,781
- Tadice.
- Hi, girl. What are you doing here?

265
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:34,447
Just hanging out.

266
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,254
Harry, Tadice.
Tadice, Harry.

267
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,556
- Tadice. Pleasure.
- We worked together at the motel.

268
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,257
"You are needing room?"

269
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:47,133
- Never mind us. Wanna dance?
- Me?

270
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,434
- Hi.
- Hey, how you doing?

271
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,598
We met this afternoon. The accident.

272
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,471
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

273
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:30,171
- How's your van?
- All right. And the car's all right?

274
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,441
- Not really.
- Yeah.

275
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,185
Excuse me.

276
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,584
What's up, Rabbit?

277
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:45,555
<i>Back from the city of Jackson...</i>

278
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,063
<i>... let's welcome home</i>
<i>our very own Alicia LeShay.</i>

279
00:32:54,272 --> 00:33:00,142
<i>We saw your face in the magazine.</i>
<i>We're all proud of you, sugar.</i>

280
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,280
Sylvester Artiste III,
record producer.

281
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,472
How you doing?

282
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:09,552
Hey, with this lady by my side,
I feel like a king.

283
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:13,157
Rabbit and me used to be
the talk of the town.

284
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,157
- You seen my advertisement?
- Yeah.

285
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,997
Now I'm gonna cut a record.
And you?

286
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,724
Yeah, I'm doing all right.
We got some new machines...

287
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:26,836
...we're working with deep shags.

288
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:30,099
Everything's going all right.
Matter of fact, I'm feeling...

289
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:34,677
Rashida, girl, how you doing?
You look fabulous.

290
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,454
Like to dance?

291
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,785
Mina, I'm leaving.

292
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:31,527
Come on, Mina, you can't leave already.
D-Money will take you home.

293
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:37,072
- Yeah, yeah. Where you stay?
- At the Monte Cristo off the 82.

294
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,937
- You sure you wanna leave?
- Yes.

295
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,806
I'll stay if you don't mind, huh?

296
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,784
Tyrone, this here's...

297
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,725
Mina.

298
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:39,327
Mina, Mina... You got the...
Are you from around here?

299
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,493
Yeah.

300
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,798
- You Mexican?
- No.

301
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:47,741
I used to live in L.A. Plenty of Mexicans
there looking as pretty as you do.

302
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,573
I'm Indian.

303
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:56,953
Oh, come on, now.
You ain't no Indian.

304
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,554
Yes, I am.

305
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:02,090
What's a girl like you
doing in Mississippi?

306
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,091
Punishing yourself?

307
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:09,231
- You about ready to go?
- She just got here.

308
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,062
Why don't you stay
and I'll take you home?

309
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,268
I'll see you in the morning, Tyrone.
Come on.

310
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,265
What?

311
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,017
So you clean carpets?

312
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,413
Yeah.

313
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,583
I got my own business.

314
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,419
Motels?

315
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,128
Motels, offices, homes...

316
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,335
Indian motels?

317
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:48,966
Yeah, some.

318
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:53,210
Mostly they clean
their own carpets, though.

319
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,470
Yeah, I know.

320
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,643
That's where I live.

321
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,476
In a motel.

322
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:01,779
Work there too.

323
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:09,124
I'm gonna give you one of my cards here.
You might want to...

324
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,988
You already gave me one.

325
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,019
I did?

326
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,091
This morning.

327
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,097
The accident.

328
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,801
Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah.

329
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,807
- I'll walk you in.
- I'll be fine.

330
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,545
- Really.
- You sure?

331
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:36,309
All right.

332
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,248
Oh, listen, I didn't mean
to butt in on your man.

333
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,415
He's not my man.

334
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:47,889
Well, maybe I'll give
you a call sometime.

335
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:38,211
- Listen to me.
- Okay, okay.

336
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:42,614
If you don't spend,
how will money come in?

337
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,756
There must be crossventilation.

338
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:51,352
If money is not important,
then why are you wasting your time...

339
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:55,989
...suing the government of Uganda
for your property?

340
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,600
Money comes...

341
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:03,637
...money goes.

342
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,602
- Right, Pontiac?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

343
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:13,943
Meet our Jaybhai.

344
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:19,181
In Uganda, you're the champion
defender of blacks...

345
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,485
...but the same blacks kicked him out.

346
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,127
Right, Jaybhai?

347
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:28,527
- Cruelty has no color.
- Principles, Pontiac.

348
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,764
Principles.

349
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:36,299
Jaybhai? Hey, Jaybhai,
who are you phoning?

350
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,397
- Hmm?
- Kampala.

351
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:43,570
To tell the person who is
living in my house to get out!

352
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,248
- Had a good time?
- Ma.

353
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,094
Where did you go?

354
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,058
Dancing.

355
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,721
I keep telling you...

356
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,628
...go out more.

357
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,666
Meet people.

358
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:14,643
You should've seen his mother's face
when you left.

359
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,677
Are you going out again?

360
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,676
Did he say anything?

361
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,585
Ma.

362
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:30,085
What happened with Okelo and Papa?

363
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,255
How did that come into your head?

364
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,925
I mean, why doesn't Papa
ever write to him...

365
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,261
...or talk about him?

366
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:48,909
- Is Harry Patel a good dancer?
- Yeah.

367
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,479
Like him?

368
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,453
No.

369
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,154
It doesn't happen in a day, you know.

370
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:04,554
Happened with Pa and you.

371
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,562
With this attitude...

372
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,067
...you'll never find anyone.

373
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:31,010
You say that Indian was ripe for plucking
and you ain't do nothing?

374
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:33,679
She did look pretty good, though.

375
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,155
T-Bone, what you think?

376
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,386
All a man got on his mind is
just getting in a woman's pants?

377
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:42,930
- That ain't all he's got on his mind.
- You got a leash on your mind.

378
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,533
She don't want you no more.

379
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,899
She got a geri-curl head,
wigwam boy from Jackson.

380
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,734
Sylvester Artiste III,
record producer.

381
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,569
You need a geri-curl, boy.

382
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:56,611
- You gonna make me late again?
- Pa, she ain't going nowhere.

383
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,709
- Good morning, Tyrone.
- Pop, how you doing?

384
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:23,495
Oh, Lord...

385
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:28,542
...grant peace to every living creature
under the sun.

386
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,374
Hey, fellows.

387
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:07,648
I want you to try something special.

388
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,390
Relax. Sit down.

389
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:22,293
Your people are very good
at sports, no?

390
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,994
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

391
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,229
Freddy Brown from downtown.

392
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:33,001
- Hector "Macho Man" Camacho.
- Macho ain't black. He's Mexican?

393
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:34,872
- He's Puerto Rican.
- Puerto Rican.

394
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:40,108
Black, brown, yellow, Mexican,
Puerto Rican, all the same.

395
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,913
As long as you're not white,
it means you are colored.

396
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,318
- Isn't that so?
- Yeah.

397
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,886
Yeah, I guess.

398
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,724
A girl had an accident
with your van yesterday. Correct?

399
00:43:55,299 --> 00:44:00,259
But no damage was done
to your person or to your van. Correct?

400
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,769
- That's right.
- Thank God.

401
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:09,068
The person whose car she was driving
is my very good friend.

402
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:13,609
- Also Indian. You get me?
- No.

403
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,251
He is worried...

404
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:20,356
...because in this country,
people are suing all the time.

405
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:28,563
Yeah, I got you now.
Yeah, this is good tea.

406
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,596
I didn't mean to laugh.

407
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:38,074
You tell your friend he ain't got
nothing to worry about.

408
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:41,837
I told him. I told him not to worry.

409
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,745
You are a good man.

410
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:47,280
All us people of color
must stick together.

411
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,678
That's right.

412
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,980
Because you and your brothers,
you all done all right by us.

413
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:55,819
And me and my brothers,
we gonna do all right by y'all.

414
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,086
United we stand.
Divided we fall.

415
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:04,462
That's right. Right on, brother.
Power to the people.

416
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,906
What a brother.

417
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:13,270
"Power to the people."

418
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:17,744
Anil.

419
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,440
I spoke to him. It's all okay.

420
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,855
All right.

421
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,553
- Hello.
- <i>Is that Demetrius?</i>

422
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:36,493
- <i>Yes, ma'am. Who's this?</i>
- Mina.

423
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:41,331
Oh, Mina, hey.
What's up?

424
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:45,066
I just wanted to say thanks.

425
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:49,576
You know, the other night?
Thanks for dropping me home.

426
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:53,774
- Yeah, okay. Bye.
- <i>Wait a minute, hold on, now. Relax.</i>

427
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,715
Relax. Wait a minute.
I ain't gonna sue.

428
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,286
- What?
- Hello?

429
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,182
Yeah, I'm here.

430
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,962
Look, what you doing
Sunday afternoon?

431
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:13,431
Sunday...
Nothing much.

432
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:18,137
Would you come to my house
and have dinner with me and my family?

433
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,039
I'd love to.

434
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,108
Mina.

435
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,813
My father always used to say:

436
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:31,511
"They can take everything from you...

437
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,952
...but they can't take
away your education."

438
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,354
Papa, please.

439
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:39,661
Mina...

440
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:45,166
...you are too intelligent to waste
your life cleaning bathrooms.

441
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:56,208
It makes me feel
I failed you as a father.

442
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:05,252
Look, Pa, there's nothing wrong
with cleaning bathrooms.

443
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,658
When you win your case...

444
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,961
...and you get your money...

445
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,563
...l'll think about college.

446
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:23,895
Okay?

447
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,720
Sure is hot today, man.

448
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,993
Give me that.
Give me that wrench.

449
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:52,299
- Shit, look at this carburetor.
- Hi.

450
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,454
- What's up, Jay?
- Hey, Skillet.

451
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:15,956
How's the lawsuit?
Those niggers paid up yet?

452
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,589
Oh, yeah.

453
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:23,757
So as long as I can see those
dimples today, I'm doing just fine.

454
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:27,165
Go on, now.
Go drink your beer.

455
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,996
See you, Skillet.

456
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,367
All right.

457
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,009
Jaymini.

458
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,615
Anil phoned me again.
Same old complaint.

459
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,717
We must talk to Mina.

460
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:46,618
She's so rude to him all the time,
and I owe him so much money still.

461
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:49,155
What?

462
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,658
Where did this come from?

463
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,927
It's always been here.

464
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:38,739
- How long you been in Mississippi?
- Three years.

465
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:43,005
- And before that? India?
- No, before that I was in England.

466
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,980
- And before that I was in Africa.
- Yeah?

467
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,517
- I've never been to India.
- Never been to India?

468
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:52,018
- No.
- You kidding.

469
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,884
No, I'm not.

470
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:56,150
I'm a mix Masala.

471
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,317
"Mix Masala," huh?

472
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:02,795
What's that? One of them
kind of, religious thing or...?

473
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,831
- What?
- No.

474
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:08,995
It's a bunch of hot spices.

475
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,201
You hot and spicy, huh?

476
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,645
Yeah, mix Masala.

477
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,615
That's what I'm gonna call you.

478
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:27,084
I told you. It's the Mexican...
I mean, that Indian girl.

479
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,690
Damn.

480
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,761
Everybody, this is Mina.

481
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:43,770
She's from England
and India and Africa.

482
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,374
Anywhere else you're from?

483
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,678
- I'm his father. Williben.
- Nice to meet you.

484
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,313
Pleased to meet you.

485
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,972
- Meet the family.
- Go on.

486
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:57,052
- Dexter, you turned that chicken over?
- Yeah, Money.

487
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,188
- This is my sister Rose.
- Mina.

488
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,550
- Hello.
- Hello.

489
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:05,058
- She tough, watch out for her.
- Don't pay him any mind.

490
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,686
- This is Dexter, my youngest son.
- Hi.

491
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:14,565
- You're from Africa?
- I was born there and then...

492
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:16,995
Tyrone.

493
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,903
- You remember me.
- What's going on?

494
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,237
- Bring the food.
- It's coming, Granddaddy.

495
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,038
- Bring the food.
- Coming!

496
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,874
We waiting on Alicia.

497
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:28,245
If I say I'm going to dinner
for someone's birthday...

498
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,147
...l'll be sure to be on time.

499
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,585
Alicia's busy, Aunt Rose.
She's moving up in the world.

500
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:39,992
I never did like that girl. Anybody
change their name to LeShay...

501
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:43,662
- You got a mean old mouth.
- I say the truth like I see it.

502
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:46,701
Where's the food?
Where's the food?

503
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:51,136
While they blew money up their noses,
Eddie had his head on his shoulders.

504
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:54,277
- Eddie Murphy.
- That's why I ain't going back to L.A.

505
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,776
I'm biding my time here
in Greenwood...

506
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,848
...until I learn how to handle success.
You understand?

507
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:04,350
I'm hanging around here too.
You know, until I get myself situated.

508
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,550
I'll go see if they need help
in the kitchen.

509
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:11,387
You need any help with that help?

510
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:14,394
Because I'm right here. Yeah.

511
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:18,596
Man, just looking at her
make me break into a sweat.

512
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:21,168
Don't sweat all over the chicken.

513
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:25,707
I can't wait to see Alicia's face
when she see her.

514
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:29,004
When Alicia comes back to you,
you can pass Mina to me.

515
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,374
Like she a bag of groceries
or something?

516
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,948
You so righteous,
you should've been a preacher.

517
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,449
I tell you what,
you should go out with Alicia.

518
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,884
I tell you something,
I already been out with her.

519
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:45,588
He's about the nicest man
a girl could ever ask for.

520
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:49,823
- We're just friends.
- Did I say any different?

521
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:54,702
He was all set
to go to Jackson State.

522
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:58,398
When his mama died, he didn't
wanna leave his daddy alone...

523
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:01,373
...because that's the kind
of boy he is.

524
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:06,676
Now, I made a vow to Grace
that I would look after her boy.

525
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,819
And I've been like a mother
to him ever since.

526
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:12,477
Doing so well now,
with his own business...

527
00:53:12,656 --> 00:53:14,681
...makes me right proud of him.

528
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,416
It's not easy, you know?

529
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:19,585
Sometimes, no matter
how hard you work...

530
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:22,459
...things have a way of going wrong.

531
00:53:22,632 --> 00:53:26,068
That's when you gotta know how
to make them right. Know what I mean?

532
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:27,893
Lord...

533
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:30,369
...bless this gathering...

534
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,271
...and remember
our dear departed Grace.

535
00:53:34,444 --> 00:53:36,844
Amen. Let's eat.

536
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,683
- Granddaddy.
- Did you say you were from Indianola?

537
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:46,822
- No. India.
- You have to yell. He don't hear good.

538
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,117
- India.
- Indiana?

539
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:51,516
India.

540
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,087
Where're the biscuits?

541
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:59,200
What's Africa like?
It's not like <i>Shaka Zulu</i> is it?

542
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:02,896
Some places.
You know, they got cities too.

543
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:06,941
- We used to live in Kampala.
- Isn't that where Idi Amin is from?

544
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,773
Y'all hush with all the questions.
Let the girl eat her food.

545
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,541
I'm going to Africa one day
to see Nelson Mandela.

546
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,708
Then I can say
I saw somebody for sure!

547
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,318
Who gonna pay for the ticket?
Welfare?

548
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:20,850
Young lady, tell me.

549
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:24,516
How come they got Indians in Africa?

550
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:28,828
The British brought them
to build the railway.

551
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,864
Like slaves.

552
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,996
I guess.
That's how my grandfather came.

553
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,071
Then the railway was finished
and he stayed on.

554
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:40,676
- How come you left?
- Dexter, let her eat her food.

555
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:44,003
- I'm just asking a question.
- Just let her eat.

556
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,614
What's wrong with asking
how come she left?

557
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:50,981
There ain't nothing wrong with asking
why she left, just let her eat.

558
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,901
It's time for the cake!

559
00:55:12,709 --> 00:55:16,008
Happy birthday, Uncle Williben.

560
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:26,654
Come on, now. Help me blow it out.

561
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,156
I used to know someone in Indianola.

562
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:34,559
She don't know that person,
because she's from India.

563
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:37,894
- What did you get, Uncle Williben?
- Beautiful.

564
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:42,004
- Look at it.
- That's from all of us, Dad.

565
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:47,670
- For when I retire, huh?
- And the sooner the better.

566
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,937
Ruining your health
for old Mrs. Morgan...

567
00:55:50,113 --> 00:55:52,946
...who don't say hello
when she pass me on the street.

568
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,811
Happy birthday.

569
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:59,647
Well, Mina's gotta go,
so we gonna head on out.
