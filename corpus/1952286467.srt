1
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:08,341
This is the story of a legendary land...

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:13,040
in a dimension slightly askew
from our own, called "Ganache."

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,617
For thousands of years,
the monarchy of Ganache...

4
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:20,887
was controlled by the Kinka,
who had magic powers.

5
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,490
The Byoh, who practiced
the art of deception,

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,358
raised the flag of
rebellion against them...

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,758
and plotted to destroy
the royal house.

8
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:36,269
The bloody uprising
scorched the land.

9
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:41,708
And one by one, the sorcerers of the
Kinka fell to the swords of the Byoh.

10
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,477
When it was clear his
castle would soon fall,

11
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,713
King Mahtah, the leader of the Kinka,

12
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,949
entrusted the restoration of the royal
house to his newborn daughter.

13
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,118
He gave the princess
to a trusted retainer...

14
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,053
and ordered him to
escape from Ganache.

15
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:05,165
And no one knows what
became of the Kinka Princess,

16
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:09,202
who is said to possess
tremendous magical powers...

17
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:14,936
Magical Meow Meow Taruto

18
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,795
It's the perfect day for a move, isn't it?

19
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,829
This is everything, right?

20
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,302
Yes.

21
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,099
Okay, then we'll get going.

22
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,663
Iori, we're leaving.

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,609
Iori...

24
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:21,402
Meow 1
Beginning, Beginning

25
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,045
It's completely empty.

26
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,181
It looks like we only just missed them.

27
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,683
So, we're back to where we started.

28
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,277
We must find her, as soon as possible!

29
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:47,127
Isn't there anything fun to do?
Nani ka ii koto nai kana?

30
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:51,371
I ask the swaying wild flowers
Soyogu no no hana

31
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:55,408
The wind doesn't tell me anything
Kaze wa nani mo tsugezu

32
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:58,378
It just passes by
Tada sugite yuku

33
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:03,049
It's a riddle, and the answer is
Nazo nazo kotae wa

34
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:07,353
Beyond the sky
Sora no mukou ni

35
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,291
I saw this in a dream
Yume de mita koto aru

36
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:17,230
Let's try going down this road
Kono michi wo itte miyou yo

37
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,334
Surely, surely, my heart
Kitto kitto kodou ga

38
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:25,405
Surely, surely, will start beating faster
Kitto kitto to takanaru yo

39
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:32,607
Let's take today's flower and, yes, send it to tomorrow
Kyou no hana wo sou asu ni todokeyou

40
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,582
Little footsteps, one after another
Chiisa na ashioto kasanete

41
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,688
Sound out the rhythm of love
Ai no rizumu wo narasou

42
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:45,291
The joy of our having met
Futari deaeta yorokobi ga

43
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:49,284
Resounds through the sky
Sora ni hibiki hirogaru

44
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:54,224
This whole town is my new garden, meow!

45
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:08,547
I -- Iori...

46
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:10,538
IORI!!!

47
00:04:15,254 --> 00:04:17,956
The whole town is her garden?

48
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:22,127
She has some nerve saying
that when she's new here.

49
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:24,595
Hey, shall we tease her a bit?

50
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:27,758
Ah, Mama.

51
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,431
Yeah, we're here. Are you
gonna be late again tonight?

52
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:37,170
Iori? Well, you know, he's
the same as he always is.

53
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,327
Iori! I've got Mama on the phone.
Do you want to talk to her?

54
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,833
Well, I'm rather in the middle
of something at the moment.

55
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:03,631
Can you just tell my older sister I said hello?

56
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,199
He says "hello."

57
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:08,636
Iori!

58
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:13,512
Listen, listen! There's a really
scary-looking house over there and...

59
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:18,283
Taruto, look at this. It's a
German-made potato masher.

60
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:20,519
Aren't German-made things nice?

61
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,154
Not that, meow!!

62
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:23,883
It's German-made!

63
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:33,020
Iori, what are you doing?
Help me straighten up in here!

64
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:36,401
Oh, Kinako. Shall we get some yams?

65
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:37,402
Huh?

66
00:05:37,402 --> 00:05:42,274
We'll grow them here in the garden.
Yes, that's it! Let's get some yams!

67
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:47,268
Taruto, yams are very nice. You can
make all sorts of sweets out of them.

68
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,504
Sweets?

69
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:53,886
Wait a sec, it's fine if we
have yams or potatoes but--

70
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,654
Potatoes?

71
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:57,019
You'd rather have potatoes?

72
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:03,028
Potatoes are good as well,
but I recommend yams.

73
00:06:03,028 --> 00:06:08,022
Basically, the climate here is
better suited for growing them.

74
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:12,037
The reason potatoes are grown in Europe...

75
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:16,940
is because they thrive in the
cooler climate you find there.

76
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:21,813
By the way, there are more yams
in the Orient than Europe is...

77
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:23,781
Oh, that's right! Did you know this?

78
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,018
Both the yam and the
potato were discovered...

79
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,954
-Iori! Bring this luggage up to the second floor!
-when Columbus went to the Americas...

80
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:32,323
-Iori! Bring this luggage up to the second floor!
-and were brought back to Europe at the same time.

81
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,127
-Geez! At this point I wouldn't mind getting a hand from the cat!
-Queen lsabella the First, who ruled Spain at that time,

82
00:06:35,127 --> 00:06:36,754
-Geez! At this point I wouldn't mind getting a hand from the cat!
-apparently took a liking to them.

83
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:40,265
By the way, the yam is from
the morning glory family...

84
00:06:40,265 --> 00:06:42,834
and the potato from the aubergine family.

85
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:47,639
-Iori, just leave it to me! I'll give her a hand, meow!
-They both produce starchy tuber roots underground.

86
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,075
The potato is called a Jaka potato in Japan...

87
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,777
because it was originally
imported by way of Jakarta,

88
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:53,005
which is now the capital of Indonesia.

89
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:54,908
Meow!

90
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:08,254
Taruto! What are you doing?!

91
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:09,361
For goodness sake, you've spilled stuff all over the place!

92
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,629
-What'd she do?
-For goodness sake, you've spilled stuff all over the place!

93
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:11,430
-I don't know...
-For goodness sake, you've spilled stuff all over the place!

94
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,967
Lemme go, meow! Iori, save me, meow!

95
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,502
Why did Iori take in this cat?!

96
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:20,096
Iori's whims can be a real pain!

97
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,441
You find about 100 grams
of starch in a potato...

98
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,432
Iori!

99
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,372
Iori! How long are you
going to keep that cat?!

100
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:32,417
Well, you see, I just used my
magic to try and help, meow!

101
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:34,386
I wasn't being naughty, meow!

102
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:35,910
Magic...?

103
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:40,116
There, there. I understand. I see, I see.

104
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,228
I guess I'll try to get some
shopping done before it gets dark.

105
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:50,358
Only Iori understands my feelings, meow!

106
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,235
You just wanted to play, right, Taruto?

107
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,505
But you mustn't be naughty, okay?

108
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:00,078
There you go!

109
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:03,741
That's not it! I was trying to
use magic to help, meow!

110
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,578
Is it that much fun? Here you go!

111
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,488
That's it!

112
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,950
Tail... That girl's...!

113
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:20,489
Chitose, don't trip out.

114
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,564
Iori...!

115
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:28,472
Huh? That's strange.
Suddenly, I feel so sleepy...

116
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,904
Taruto...

117
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,615
This is familiar somehow...

118
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:21,993
I'll see you later.

119
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:24,052
See you later, Darling.

120
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,032
Iori...

121
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:44,146
What?

122
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,868
Who's there, meow?

123
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,908
Maybe I'm imagining things...

124
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:36,428
A gho... A gho... A gho... A gho...

125
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:37,486
A GHOST!!!

126
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:44,002
Now then, shall we start the welcome party?

127
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:45,731
Tail... Tail...

128
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:50,465
Tail... Tail...

129
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:54,209
Hmpf! I wonder if there's anything to eat?

130
00:11:56,915 --> 00:12:00,252
There probably isn't much, since
you're only just moving in, but...

131
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,810
Found some!

132
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,956
Don't be a thief!

133
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:06,725
Did you say "thief"?!

134
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:10,252
Those are the cakes...that Iori made...

135
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:14,898
Calling me a thief...
You'll ruin my reputation!

136
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:18,470
As we've lived in this city a long time,

137
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,007
we only came to give a newcomer
some much needed guidance.

138
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,269
Tail...

139
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,511
Um... Excuse me, um...

140
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:29,714
-It's wonderful...!
-Um... Excuse me, um...

141
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:30,112
Um... Excuse me, um...

142
00:12:34,486 --> 00:12:36,647
What was that just now?

143
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:39,457
There is something in here.

144
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,721
I don't smell any mice but...

145
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:45,697
Do you have any unusual pets?

146
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:48,567
No, we don't, meow.

147
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,702
Then it must be burglars.

148
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:52,971
Maybe they're looking for food.

149
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:55,269
That would be you two, meow.

150
00:12:58,076 --> 00:13:02,069
Or maybe... it's a monster,
coming to eat you!

151
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:07,112
Yes, yes. Her tail looks absolutely delicious.

152
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,822
Run for it!

153
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:13,017
While we can use her as a distraction!

154
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:15,827
It's with the utmost
reluctance I take my leave.

155
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,920
It was nice meeting you.

156
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:23,723
W-W-Wait!
I want to run away, too, meow!

157
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,078
I don't wanna get eaten, meow!

158
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,013
How'd you untie that knot?!

159
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:38,511
You don't give up easily, do you?

160
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:45,316
Iori!

161
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:52,127
Iori... wake up, Iori!
A monster is coming, meow!

162
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,097
Stay away!

163
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,982
Stay away!

164
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:23,156
How long will you stand
there shaking in fear?!

165
00:14:24,996 --> 00:14:28,022
B- But, Ultra Mask, I...!

166
00:14:28,466 --> 00:14:31,799
You're the only one who can fight them now!

167
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:36,029
If you don 't protect your
loved ones, who will?!

168
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,135
My loved ones...!

169
00:14:40,812 --> 00:14:46,045
You have hidden powers inside you!
Now, take courage and fight!

170
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:49,548
That's right! I have hidden powers!

171
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,685
Transform! Matrix the Brave!

172
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:00,690
Perfect, meow!

173
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,864
Prepare yourself!

174
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:16,680
You won't escape, meow!

175
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:20,217
Heh-heh, Do you think
you can keep up with me?

176
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:25,587
Meow!

177
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:27,053
Meow...

178
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:30,128
How naive!

179
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:33,962
You fiend! It's cowardly
to attack from behind!

180
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:35,667
Take THIS!

181
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,794
Meow! Meow!
Meow, meow, meow!

182
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:58,382
Y- Your pretty tough, meow!

183
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,259
Farewell!

184
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:02,060
Come back here!

185
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,618
Wait!

186
00:16:14,372 --> 00:16:16,306
Come out of there, meow!

187
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,885
It's... It's... It's... It's...

188
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,890
IT'S HERE!!!

189
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:41,399
Please don't eat me, meow...

190
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,459
Taruto, be strong!
You must be strong, meow!

191
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:50,634
Taruto, what have you been
fighting for until now, meow?

192
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,411
That's right.
I'm fighting to save Iori, meow.

193
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:55,470
Exactly, so take heart!

194
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:10,825
I'm not scared, meow!

195
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:16,958
I AM scared after all!

196
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:30,007
Please, don't eat me!

197
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:31,044
Huh...?

198
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,986
Who are you?

199
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:38,189
I- I'm Kakiemon, they call me Kakipi.

200
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:39,884
I won't taste good if you eat me!

201
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:45,797
A mirage?

202
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:49,667
Maybe we've been following
an illusion like that, as well.

203
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:53,037
Or it could just be an unfounded rumor.

204
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:55,801
We can't be certain of that.

205
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,207
Until we are, there is only
one path we can follow!

206
00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:06,818
I see. You got trapped in there...

207
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:09,218
while you were hibernating
for the winter, meow.

208
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:12,657
Kakipi, come and visit
again sometime, meow.

209
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:15,059
S- Sure...

210
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,227
What's wrong, meow?

211
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:21,232
I can't fly. I haven't had anything
to eat or drink in a while.

212
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:23,368
I'm so hungry I can't fly.

213
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:26,304
I know! Magic is my specialty!

214
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:29,364
I'll use it to make you all sorts
of delicious foods to eat!

215
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,302
Magic? That's impossible!

216
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,267
Meow!

217
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:37,640
I wonder what she's doing?

218
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,178
Meow!

219
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:45,185
Appear! Yummy, yummy, yummy stuff!

220
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:53,494
I- I'll try again, meow.

221
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:55,956
Meow!

222
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:58,066
Meow!

223
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,032
Meow!

224
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:01,801
MEOW!

225
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:07,879
Don't worry about it! It's not like...

226
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:10,712
you're that legendary magical
princess or anything.

227
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:12,809
I'll do it, meow!

228
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:17,054
Yummy stuff! Yummy stuff!
Yummy stuff, meow!

229
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,619
LOOK OUT!

230
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,140
Incredible! Flying!
I'm flying!!

231
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,439
You might really be that princess after all!

232
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:41,437
Princess...?

233
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:51,688
No... No way, that girl...?!
It can't be...

234
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:55,517
Thank you!
I'll come back and visit!

235
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:05,631
I'm home.

236
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:10,739
Tomorrow will be a 30
degree Celsius summer day.

237
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:13,745
Who the heck are you?!

238
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:17,115
Me? I'm Taruto!

239
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,140
I'm Iori's fiancee, meow!

240
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:21,285
I sense it!

241
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:23,721
I sense it...
Somewhere in this city...

242
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:26,986
are the emanations of
a powerful magic user!

243
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:31,129
You must locate the master of
these powers. Is that clear?!

244
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:33,120
Yes!

245
00:20:44,342 --> 00:20:46,911
Round and round the little birds are
Kuru kuru kotori wa

246
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:49,547
Playing in the sky
Sora de asobu yo

247
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:52,217
Tra-la-la... Let's line up
Too-la-la-la narande

248
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,853
And sing as we walk along
Utatte arukou

249
00:20:54,853 --> 00:21:00,158
Country lanes and paths go on and on
No no michi komichi wa tsuzuiteiru

250
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:05,430
Somehow, isn't today a nice day?
Nanda ka kyou wa ii hi ja nai?

251
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,668
With a light heart (Bouncing, floaty)
Kokoro karuku (Hazumu yo fuwa fuwa)

252
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:16,007
With confidence (How far shall we go?)
Mune wo hatte (Doko made ikou ka)

253
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:21,179
The path of the clouds (Watch them as they go)
Kumo no yukue (Miokutte)

254
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:26,584
Let's sing out, the hum of Hallelujah
Utaou yo, hanauta no hareruya

255
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:31,817
Someday, you'll meet the girl for you
Itsu no hi ka ano ko ni mo aeru yo

256
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,668
NEXT EPISODE

257
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,670
Meow, meow, meow!
Did you see it?! Did you see my magic?!

258
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:48,306
I absolutely, positively have
to be related to magicians!

259
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:51,843
If I'm around, my magic will
make everything a snap!

260
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,978
Next week is... Next week is... uh...

261
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:56,839
Meow 2
Blossom, Blossom
