00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:09,208
<i>I learned from the best.
Come on, we're almost there.</i>

4
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:22,083
<i>Bad doggies!</i>

5
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,125
<i>Impeccable timing, little brother.
Very dramatic.</i>

6
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:43,541
<i>Help him, Michelangelo. He's hurt bad.</i>

7
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:58,666
<i>That's it. The resistance failed.
The Krang won.</i>

8

<i>Mikey, we need a time gateway.</i>

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,833
<i>It'll take everything I have.</i>

14
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,625
<i>I know, but this is our last chance.</i>

15
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:19,125
<i>It's our only chance.</i>

16
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:21,500
<i>Hm.</i>

17
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:26,208
<i>- Wait, what's going on? Where is he going?
- Casey, listen.</i>

18
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,416
<i>The Krang first came to our planet
through a mystic doorway.</i>

19
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,875
<i>The key that opened the doorway
looked like this.</i>

20
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,333
<i>Why are you telling me this?</i>

21
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,541
<i>Because Mikey's
about to send you back in time</i>

22
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,750
<i>to the day that the key was stolen.</i>

23
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,375
<i>Wait, he's gonna what?</i>

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,375
<i>The people who stole that key
opened the doorway for the Krang.</i>

25
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:13,333
<i>You have to find it before that happens.</i>

26
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,625
<i>Find the key, stop the Krang.</i>

27
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,833
<i>- But, Sensei...
- Say it!</i>

28
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,333
<i>"Find the key, stop the Krang."</i>

29
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,708

30
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,625

<i>when you're done saving the world,
do me a favor.</i>

<i>Where...</i>

39
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:47,666
<i>I made it?</i>

40
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,458

The choice was clear.</i>

<i>And end up with a worry line
between my eyes like you?</i>

142

<i>You know, valley, gorge, crevasse.</i>

145
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:40,750
<i>The only reason I have a chasm
is I have to worry about you bozos 24/7.</i>

handle anything that comes our way.</i>

155
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:13,958

00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,416
<i>Whoa.</i>

170
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,333
<i>So many people.</i>

171
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,166
<i>How am I gonna save them all, Sensei?</i>

172
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,958
<i>I really wish you were here.</i>

173
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,333
<i>Wait, you are!</i>

174
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,791
<i>I just need to find you.</i>

175
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,125
<i>April.</i>

176
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,291
{\an8}<i>She'll know.</i>

177
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,791
<i>Huh?</i>

178
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,125
<i>Hi, professor. Do you have a sec?</i>

179
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,125
<i>Hmm.</i>

180
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,416
<i>Are you even in this class?</i>

181
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,625
<i>I'm April O'Neil, journalism major.</i>

182
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:45,750
<i>I write for the
Eastlaird University Daily News.</i>

183
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:49,125
<i>Maybe I could get some shots of you
at the whiteboard for a story?</i>

184
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,083
<i>Oh! Of course.</i>

185
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,458
<i>So, uh, what... what should I do?</i>

186
00:13:54,541 --> 00:13:57,250
<i>You know, just write something sciencey.</i>

187
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,291
<i>I actually have the perfect equation
for your article.</i>

188
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,333
<i>Now a few where you're
staring thoughtfully at your work.</i>

189
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:07,291
<i>Oh, I always stare intently
at my equations.</i>

190
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,125
<i>Especially this one.</i>

191
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,291
<i>You know,
I think I should put on my lab coat.</i>

192
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,333
<i>- Look at it!
- Oh! Okay.</i>

193
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:21,625
<i>You know, I could probably
stare at this equation all day.</i>

194
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,166
<i>This is April O'Neil, investigative
reporter, Eastlaird University Daily News.</i>

195
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,250
<i>For years, this college shot down
rumors that a foreign government</i>

196
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,500
<i>is paying them millions</i>

197
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,166
<i>to develop a super-toxic
herbicidal deforestation bomb.</i>

198
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,625
<i>Those rumors end today because
I'm about to blow the lid off Big Chem.</i>

199
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,916
<i>April O'Neil.</i>

200
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,916
{\an8}<i> Ooh. This stuff looks nasty.</i>

201
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,750
{\an8}<i> Hey! Who's there?</i>

202
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:54,833
<i>Hm?</i>

203
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,916
<i>Evidence, baby.</i>

204
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,416
<i>Oh boy.</i>

205
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:15,083
<i>Well, it's a good thing video
ain't the only thing I took.</i>

206
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:22,375
<i>April! Yes!</i>

207
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,708
<i>- Commander O'Neil...
- Catlike reflex!</i>

208
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,666
<i>What's the matter with you,
creeping up on a person in the dark?</i>

209
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,458
<i>What the...</i>

210
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,625
<i>And then I saw that picture
and I brought him here.</i>

211
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,666
<i>Sensei?</i>

212
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,458
<i>Hm?</i>

213
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:53,916
<i>It's you!</i>

214
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,208
<i>It's all of you! Together!</i>

215
00:15:56,291 --> 00:16:00,833
<i>- I never thought I'd see you again!
- I'm so happy I could hug you!</i>

216
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,666
<i>Who are you,
and why do you have a picture of us?</i>

217
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,166
<i>Yeah, who took this? 'Cause I look great.</i>

218
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,541
<i>What's your favorite pizza?
'Cause I'm ordering right now.</i>

219
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,083
<i>And why are you
wearing genius-built apparel?</i>

220
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,791
<i>That's trademarked!</i>

221
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,041
<i>Grappling hook!</i>

222
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,541
<i>What's going on?</i>

223
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,208
<i>He's trying to escape!</i>

224
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,708
<i>- Want me to knock him out again?
- Let me.</i>

225
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,000
<i>Donnie? Donnie!</i>

226
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,125
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

227
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,333
<i>Wa... Wait, stop!
I'm a friend. Let me explain.</i>

228
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:45,791
<i>Let's start over.</i>

229
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:50,208
<i>My name is Casey Jones,
and the reason I have this photo</i>

230
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,625
<i>and your tech
is because you gave it to me,</i>

231
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,916
<i>but not yet, because I'm from...</i>

232
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,958
<i>the future!</i>

233
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,583
<i>This isn't a joke.</i>

234
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:08,416
<i>Please, if time travel is possible,
future Donnie would have come back</i>

235
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,041
<i>and already given me
all the lottery numbers like we planned.</i>

236
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:16,250
<i>It's true. I need you to believe me.
Humanity depends on it.</i>

237
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:19,958
<i>In the future,
an alien race decimated the planet.</i>

238
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:24,416
<i>We were hunted. We lived in caves.
We ate leaves and rats.</i>

239
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:25,791
<i>No offense.</i>

240
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,416
<i>None taken. We are delicious.</i>

241
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:33,666
<i>I know how this sounds,
but Master Leonardo gave me a mission.</i>

242
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,125
<i>I do like how he calls me "Master."</i>

243
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,458
<i>Of course I do.</i>

244
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,791
<i>You are the greatest ninja
the world has ever seen.</i>

245
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,916
<i>You told me to find the key
and stop the Krang.</i>

246
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,833
<i>"Aliens." Pfft.</i>

247
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,000
<i>Sure.
This story just keeps getting better.</i>

248
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
<i>Splints?</i>

249
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,416
<i>"The Krang"?</i>

250
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,333
<i>I have heard that name.</i>

251
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:02,250
<i>Powerful, barbaric creatures
worshiped by the Foot Clan.</i>

252
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,208
<i>Legend says they came from the stars.</i>

253
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,625
<i>Ruthless, unmerciful, with one desire,</i>

254
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,500
<i>to enslave our world
like so many before us.</i>

255
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,291
<i>All seemed lost,</i>

256
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,791
<i>until great mystic warriors
forged a mighty weapon,</i>

257
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:24,250
<i>a key that was used to lock them
in a prison dimension beyond this realm.</i>

258
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:27,250
<i>Over the centuries,
the mystic key remained hidden</i>

259
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:32,041
<i>to protect humankind
and prevent the return of the Krang.</i>

260
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,625
<i>So...</i>

261
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:36,583
<i>Future boy is really from the future?</i>

262
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,083
<i>Mind...</i>

263
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,333
<i>Someone finds the key! Today!</i>

264
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:46,125
<i>They steal it and use it
to open a doorway and free the Krang!</i>

265
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,791
<i>That's why I came back, to find it first.</i>

266
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,708
<i>Master Leonardo drew a picture
on the back of that photo.</i>

267
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,375
<i>So to stop the Krang,</i>

268
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:56,541
<i>all we have to do
is find the key before it's stolen.</i>

269
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:58,541
<i>- Mm.
- Hm-mm.</i>

270
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,000
<i>Huh.</i>

271
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:03,708
<i>What?</i>

272
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,750
<i>Yeah, did future handsome,
amazing me tell you what to do</i>

273
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,666
<i>in case that already happened?</i>

274
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,958
<i>'Cause that already happened.</i>

275
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:14,125
<i>Mm!</i>

276
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:17,833
<i>Oh no, we're too late!</i>

277
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,208
<i>No, we're not.</i>

278
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,958
<i>'Cause we know who has the key,
the Foot Clan.</i>

279
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,208
<i>Okay, we gotta find them
before they use it,</i>

280
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,708
<i>and this time, we do it together!</i>

281
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,500
<i>Uh, can someone untie me now?</i>

282
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,791
<i>Oh no...</i>

283
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:58,208
<i>Villain to villain,
your hideout is a bit... lacking.</i>

284
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,333
<i>Might I suggest some velvet, a fireplace,</i>

285
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,041
<i>maybe a fuzzy white cat
with a diamond necklace?</i>

286
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:15,541
<i>Tonight, we liberate our masters
from their dimensional prison.</i>

287
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,958
<i>With this key,</i>

288
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:21,916
<i>we shall free them to lay waste
to this world and enslave its people.</i>

289
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,375
<i>Ah, I thought we were just gonna rob
a bank and be, you know, crime buddies.</i>

290
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,583
<i>We shall follow the Krang
as they lead the Foot Clan to glory!</i>

291
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,666
<i>Bored.</i>

292
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:36,625
<i>You!</i>

293
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,250
<i>- Leo!
- What?</i>

294
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:43,000
<i>I was waiting for a good spot to jump in,
but they just kept blabbity-blab-ing.</i>

295
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,375
<i>There it is! That's the key.</i>

296
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:51,166
<i>Get them! Don't let them
interfere with the ceremony!</i>

297
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,083
<i>No!</i>

298
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,166
<i>It started!</i>

299
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,125
<i>He's unlocking the doorway!
We need to get up there right now!</i>

300
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,166
<i>Casey, go. We've got you covered.</i>

301
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,833
<i>Oh no.</i>

302
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,250
<i>Oh.</i>

303
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,333
<i>Oh no! They're here!</i>

304
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:54,375
<i>Then let's make sure
their visit's short and sweet.</i>

305
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,125
<i>I'm finally free!</i>

306
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:10,000
<i>The people of this planet
will pay for what they've done to me.</i>

307
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,541
<i>Welcome to Earth.
I hope you don't enjoy your stay!</i>

308
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,291
<i>Oh!</i>

309
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,041
<i>Enough tricks!</i>

310
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,791
<i>Mikey! Donnie! No!</i>

311
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,333
<i>No...</i>

312
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,041
<i>Raph, what happened to our powers?</i>

313
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,000
<i>They... They're gone.</i>

314
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:22,416
<i>What did they do to us?</i>

315
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,875
<i>Brother, sister, join me.</i>

316
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:32,333
<i>Time for us to finish remaking
this universe in the image of Krang.</i>

317
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,916
<i>How I've waited for this day.</i>

318
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,458
<i>Indeed.</i>

319
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:47,000
<i>Brother, widen the portal
and retrieve our ship, the Technodrome.</i>

320
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:51,750
<i>Once it is here,
this world will kneel before us.</i>

321
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:57,000
<i>Oh, if you two don't mind,
I haven't killed anything in ages.</i>

322
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,041
<i>No!</i>

323
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:29,875
<i>Huh?</i>

324
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:31,416
<i>No!</i>

325
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:44,791
<i>Retreat!</i>

326
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,500
<i>Retreat? We don't retreat!</i>

327
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:50,875
<i>Leo, for once, listen to me.
They're too powerful and Dad's hurt.</i>

328
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,541
<i>You don't understand.</i>

329
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,375
<i>If we don't close that doorway,
it's only gonna get worse.</i>

330
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:56,458
<i>Raph?</i>

331
00:24:56,541 --> 00:25:00,041
<i>I'm not gonna argue with you, Leo!
Donnie, escape pods, now!</i>

332
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,458
<i>You don't have to tell me twice!</i>

333
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,791
<i>Sensei, we need to get that key!</i>

334
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:42,416
<i>Leo!</i>

335
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:12,625
<i>Huh?</i>

336
00:26:31,166 --> 00:26:32,166
<i>Raph?</i>

337
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:41,875
<i>Raph, wait, no.</i>

338
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:45,583
<i>Wait, Raph! Raph! No, Raph!
Raph! No, Raph!</i>

339
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,750
<i>Escape pods incoming.</i>

340
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,916
<i>Congratulations
on surviving, fam.</i>

341
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:03,916
<i>Huh?</i>

342
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,541
<i>Oh, I hate that.</i>

343
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,958
<i>Everyone okay? Anybody hurt?</i>

344
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,583
<i>How did we get here?</i>

345
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:12,750
<i>Donnie pods.
We've never had to use those before.</i>

346
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,208
<i>So, how would everyone
rate their escape experience?</i>

347
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:20,250
<i>"Very satisfied," "Very, very satisfied,"
"Extremely satisfied"?</i>

348
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,833
<i>- Donnie!
- Sorry. Sorry.</i>

349
00:27:22,916 --> 00:27:24,541
<i>Data collection calms me down.</i>

350
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,083
<i>Splints.</i>

351
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:30,666
<i>This is terrible! Why did we leave?</i>

352
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,125
<i>In case you didn't notice,
we were getting our butts kicked!</i>

353
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:36,708
<i>But my mission was to stop them!</i>

354
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:38,541
<i>Now, the Krang are using that key</i>

355
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:41,708
<i>to bring in something
that will destroy the world.</i>

356
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,208
<i>We lost.</i>

357
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,875
<i>Oof.</i>

358
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,750
<i>- Where's my other pod?
- Where's Raph?</i>

359
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,666
<i>Ah, did you know this would happen?
Why didn't you tell me?</i>

360
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,500
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Easy!</i>

361
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:09,375
<i>- Leo, what's going on? Where's Raph?
- Leo, what happened to Raph?</i>

362
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:10,583
<i>Leonardo?</i>

363
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,166
<i>They...</i>

364
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:14,583
<i>They got him.</i>

365
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:15,916
<i>You left Raph?</i>

366
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,166
<i>He left himself.</i>

367
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,500
<i>He used his pod to save me, all because
I went after this stupid thing.</i>

368
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,250
<i>You got it! Nice.</i>

369
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,958
<i>"Nice"? They captured Raph!</i>

370
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,291
<i>He's from the future!
He knew this would happen!</i>

371
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,000
<i>No, I didn't.
This didn't happen in my time.</i>

372
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:36,000
<i>We changed the past, and you got the key.</i>

373
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:38,166
<i>That means there's
still a chance to stop them.</i>

374
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,416
<i>- No, we have to save Raph. Come on.
- Leo, wait.</i>

375
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
<i>If you won't come, I'll go myself.</i>

376
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:48,416
<i>- We've lost our mystic powers.
- We don't have a plan!</i>

377
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,833
<i>We don't need a plan.</i>

378
00:28:49,916 --> 00:28:52,916
<i>"I'm the greatest ninja
the world's ever seen," his words.</i>

379
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,291
<i>Shouldn't we talk about this</i>

380
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:57,125
<i>before we run off all half-cocked,
willy-nilly, pell-mell?</i>

381
00:28:57,208 --> 00:29:00,250
<i>I keep being told
I'm doing this hero thing wrong.</i>

382
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,166
<i>But I got the key, didn't I?</i>

383
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,541
<i>I get results,
so now we're doing it my way.</i>

384
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:08,958
<i>My son, listen to your team.</i>

385
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,625
<i>This is not about you.</i>

386
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,458
<i>They made it about me
when they took my brother.</i>

387
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:17,625
<i>Trust me, I got this.</i>

388
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,708
<i>Donnie, you're driving.</i>

389
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,291
<i>What do we do with this?</i>

390
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:31,291
<i>We can't just bring it with us,
but we can't just leave it behind.</i>

391
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,625
<i>Then we should destroy it.</i>

392
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:36,166
<i>Splints and I will stay here
and take care of business.</i>

393
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:39,958
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

394
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:45,291
<i>Thanks, Commander O'Neil.</i>

395
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,125
<i>"Commander"? I like the sound of that.</i>

396
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,708
<i>Oh, look at it.</i>

397
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,000
<i>Disgusting.</i>

398
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:11,291
<i>Try looking in a mirror.</i>

399
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,208
<i>Ugh, it's talking at me.</i>

400
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,083
<i>I'm going to rip out its tongue.</i>

401
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,041
<i>Forgive my sister.</i>

402
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:22,791
<i>She's got a bit of a temper.</i>

403
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:27,708
<i>And being in prison for a thousand years
hasn't done her any favors.</i>

404
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,875
<i>You're not human.</i>

405
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,125
<i>What are you?</i>

406
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,541
<i>Let me go, and I'll show you.</i>

407
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,500
<i>Hmm.</i>

408
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:40,166
<i>You're more powerful
than the people of this planet,</i>

409
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,291
<i>yet you defend them.</i>

410
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:45,541
<i>- Why?
- It's my duty.</i>

411
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:50,500
<i>A word used by the weak.</i>

412
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:54,041
<i>Many planets before yours
have spoken of duty.</i>

413
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:57,416
<i>They too have been consumed by the Krang.</i>

414
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,250
<i>And now our glorious crusade continues</i>

415
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:06,041
<i>to restore the natural order of things.</i>

416
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:11,250
<i>The strong will devour the weak.</i>

417
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,333
<i>Last I checked,</i>

418
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:15,750
<i>we weren't the ones locked in a
prison dimension for a thousand years.</i>

419
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,458
<i>That's called "trash talk."</i>

420
00:31:17,541 --> 00:31:19,125
<i>A rare misstep.</i>

421
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:22,166
<i>Once I retrieve the key
from your comrades,</i>

422
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,916
<i>I will bring forth the mighty Technodrome,</i>

423
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,875
<i>and you will witness
the true power of the Krang.</i>

424
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:34,541
<i>Now, where have they taken my key?</i>

425
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,458
<i>It won't tell you anything.</i>

426
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:39,500
<i>Let me kill it.</i>

427
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:43,041
<i>Lady brain face here is right.
I'm not telling you jack.</i>

428
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:47,125
<i>You don't have to tell me.</i>

429
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:49,500
<i>I'll look myself.</i>

430
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,000
<i>There it is.</i>

431
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:05,541
<i>They always do it the hard way.</i>

432
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:13,583
<i>Our brother and I will secure
a location for the dimensional doorway.</i>

433
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:16,833
<i>Take these soldiers
and retrieve me my key.</i>

434
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:18,541
<i>We live to serve.</i>

435
00:32:19,041 --> 00:32:23,250
<i>You will serve me whether you live or not.</i>

436
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:56,083
<i>What is this thing?</i>

437
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:59,083
<i>Hold on to your gluteus maximi!</i>

438
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:03,750
<i>The Turtle Tank, baby!
It's how we roll in the past.</i>

439
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,208
<i>I mean, the present. I mean...</i>

440
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:09,791
<i>- Ugh! Time travel's confusing.
- They're on the move.</i>

441
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:12,583
<i>According to the subcutaneous tracker
I put on Raph...</i>

442
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:15,291
<i>Wait, does that mean
you put trackers on all of us?</i>

443
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:17,833
<i>"No"?</i>

444
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:23,000
<i>No, of course I did... n't.</i>

445
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,000
<i>Based on their trajectory,
they're headed...</i>

446
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:27,208
<i>...to the tallest building in the city.</i>

447
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:29,583
<i>That's right, Metro Tower.</i>

448
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:32,958
<i>I heard the story so many times as a kid,
but I never thought...</i>

449
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:34,500
<i>"And behold,</i>

450
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:38,958
<i>from their perch atop New York City,
the Krang ripped open the sky itself."</i>

451
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,208
<i>"What came out was terror,</i>

452
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:44,750
<i>and what rained down upon us
was worse than death."</i>

453
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,458
<i>They told that to kids?</i>

454
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:51,625
<i>Man, the future is harsh.</i>

455
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,125
<i>I'm not gonna let that happen.</i>

456
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:56,708
<i>We need to get into Metro Tower
without being spotted.</i>

457
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:58,208
<i>We'll take the subway tunnels.</i>

458
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:01,791
<i>Subway tunnels don't offer much
in the way of an escape if we need it.</i>

459
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:04,875
<i>- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah, maybe we should...</i>

460
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:07,541
<i>Guys, we're doing it my way. Remember?</i>

461
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:16,666
<i>Hm?</i>

462
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,291
<i>Prepare the site so we may
bring forth the Technodrome.</i>

463
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:33,000
<i>Yes, brother.</i>

464
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:53,750
<i>See? Smooth sailing.
We'll have Raph in no time.</i>

465
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,083
<i>I hope he's okay.</i>

466
00:34:55,583 --> 00:34:58,125
<i>How are we gonna find him
once we get there?</i>

467
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:01,083
<i>I have a lot of questions
regarding "once we get there."</i>

468
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:05,750
<i>Relax. We'll do what we always do.
Ninja in, ninja their faces, ninja out.</i>

469
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:09,166
<i>That's exactly how you freed all those
families from the Krang labor camp.</i>

470
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,666
<i>Yeah, that sounds like me.</i>

471
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,791
<i>In the future,
you guys are beyond amazing.</i>

472
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:17,291
<i>The mystic powers you're able
to harness are on a whole other level.</i>

473
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:19,291
<i>Of course! What about my future?</i>

474
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:21,583
<i>I'm expecting big things for me.</i>

475
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:24,750
<i>How many Nobel prizes do I have?
Don't tell me. I wanna be surprised.</i>

476
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:29,833
<i>Donnie, you were the most brilliant,
innovative mind of all time.</i>

477
00:35:29,916 --> 00:35:33,500
<i>I'm shocked, I am.
Go on, continue to meet my expectations.</i>

478
00:35:33,583 --> 00:35:35,000
<i>What do I do in the future?</i>

479
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:39,333
<i>You are the most powerful mystic warrior
the world has ever known.</i>

480
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:43,000
<i>With those two hands,
you sent me back in time.</i>

481
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,666
<i>Wow!</i>

482
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,958
<i>Actually,
there is something I should tell you.</i>

483
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:04,458
<i>Auto brake engaged.</i>

484
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:05,541
<i>Huh.</i>

485
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,833
<i>Wow.</i>

486
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,750
<i>Think we're in the right place?</i>

487
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,250
<i>Looks like the Metro Tower station
is on the other side of those vines.</i>

488
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,791
<i>Great. Let's hoof it.</i>

489
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:18,416
<i>Through the disgusting,
drippy slime jungle?</i>

490
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:24,125
<i>I know. I know. Leo knows best,</i>

491
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:26,166
<i>but I'm not sharing my hand sanitizer.</i>

492
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,166
<i>Feeling a lack of rush
in this rush hour, right?</i>

493
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:42,375
<i>I don't know, Leo.
Something feels...</i>

494
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:44,875
<i>off.</i>

495
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:49,833
<i>Don't worry. I won't let us die.
I'm a mystic warrior.</i>

496
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,916
<i>"I feel better already,"
he said without a hint of sarcasm.</i>

497
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:56,750
<i>Look, the stairs.</i>

498
00:36:56,833 --> 00:37:01,791
<i>Sneaking in from below was the right move.
Those slimeballs will never see us coming.</i>

499
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:13,125
<i>We tried to jackhammer it,
flamethrower it, pour acid on it...</i>

500
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:17,500
<i>I thought lasers cut everything!
How did that not work?</i>

501
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:19,916
<i>There's not even a scratch!</i>

502
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,125
<i>Maybe it was your aim.</i>

503
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,875
<i>Maybe your big rat head got in the way!</i>

504
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:30,458
<i>Mmm, I'll show you, fat rat head.</i>

505
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,583
<i>Okay, deep breaths.</i>

506
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:34,750
<i>You said some things, I said some things.</i>

507
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:37,250
<i>Maybe we should just
get back to saving the world.</i>

508
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:39,541
<i>What's next?</i>

509
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,541
<i>Huh?</i>

510
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,875
<i>This cannot be good.</i>

511
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,500
<i>April O'Neil!</i>

512
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:57,041
<i>Come back here!</i>

513
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,875
<i>Faster.</i>

514
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:01,583
<i>Faster!</i>

515
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,000
<i>I knew this was a bad idea.</i>

516
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,750
<i>Leo, there's too many. We should go back.</i>

517
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:09,125
<i>No, we're gonna get to those stairs.</i>

518
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:12,166
<i>Leo, we're not gonna make it!
We have to turn back.</i>

519
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,291
<i>We push forward, get Raph, that's final.</i>

520
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:28,208
<i>Mystic hands!</i>

521
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,708
<i>Donnie! Mikey!</i>

522
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:42,875
<i>Oh no, Donnie, your soft shell!
You're exposed!</i>

523
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:45,875
<i>We gotta find shelter!</i>

524
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,416
<i>Oh, oh, keep it down, Vomitello!</i>

525
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,958
<i>Oh. Keep it down, daddy!</i>

526
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:04,125
<i>Run, insects, but you can't escape!</i>

527
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,166
<i>Don't!</i>

528
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:13,250
<i>The key, human! Give it to me!</i>

529
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:14,500
<i>Ah!</i>

530
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:36,333
<i>What did you do to me?
What did you do to my face?</i>

531
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,958
<i>Ha!</i>

532
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:40,708
<i>I knew that stuff was nasty! I told y'all!</i>

533
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:43,166
<i>Yes, yes, you're a genius. Let's go.</i>

534
00:40:11,416 --> 00:40:12,416
<i>Ah!</i>

535
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,166
<i>Donnie, come in.</i>

536
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,291
<i>They found us. Where should we go? Donnie?</i>

537
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:22,750
<i>We're trapped.</i>

538
00:40:22,833 --> 00:40:25,250
<i>We are trapped
in the subway under Metro Tower.</i>

539
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:27,083
<i>The tank is running on emergency power</i>

540
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:30,250
<i>and is covered
in some kind of Krang bio-growth.</i>

541
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,416
<i>- I repeat...
- April, come quick!</i>

542
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,458
<i>We're getting squished!</i>

543
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:35,958
<i>We're on our way!</i>

544
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,666
<i>But, April, how will we get them out?</i>

545
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,708
<i>I've got an idea.</i>

546
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,500
<i>Yeesh.
Remind me to never get on your bad side.</i>

547
00:40:53,791 --> 00:40:55,500
<i>Casey!</i>

548
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:57,458
<i>Casey, you okay?</i>

549
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,625
<i>Donnie, Mikey, anybody?</i>

550
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:06,875
<i>Ah!</i>

551
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:12,416
<i>What the heck was that?</i>

552
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:16,250
<i>Some kind of drippy, crazy Krang monster.</i>

553
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:19,000
<i>No, I mean you!
Why weren't you listening to anybody?</i>

554
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:22,333
<i>Because I was trying to get us
into the building!</i>

555
00:41:22,416 --> 00:41:23,958
<i>That sure worked out well.</i>

556
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:27,041
<i>I was doing everything right.
How could it go wrong?</i>

557
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:29,083
<i>Because you weren't
listening to your team!</i>

558
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,833
<i>You don't have
all the answers all the time!</i>

559
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:35,125
<i>I'm the greatest ninja
the world's ever seen. You said that.</i>

560
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:37,125
<i>I was wrong.</i>

561
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:38,541
<i>What?</i>

562
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:40,833
<i>You're impulsive, you're arrogant,</i>

563
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:45,416
<i>and you don't see that every decision
you make could cost someone their life.</i>

564
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:48,958
<i>You want to know what really happens
to your brothers in the future?</i>

565
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:53,166
<i>They die.
Everybody dies fighting the Krang.</i>

566
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:56,583
<i>The world needs Master Leonardo.</i>

567
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,250
<i>And all we got is this guy.</i>

568
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:15,500
<i>We have an update
on the strange situation at Metro Tower.</i>

569
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:18,833
<i>All contact has been lost
with those inside the building,</i>

570
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:20,541
<i>and conflicting reports suggest</i>

571
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:24,125
<i>something is barricading entrance
for emergency personnel.</i>

572
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:37,416
<i>Fools.</i>

573
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,250
<i>These creatures should
welcome the power of the Krang.</i>

574
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:45,041
<i>You on the rooftop!
Stop and surrender immediately!</i>

575
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:48,541
{\an8}<i>We've got eyes on the roof top
where the police are confronting...</i>

576
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:49,708
{\an8}<i>What is that?</i>

577
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:52,541
<i>You may begin.</i>

578
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,708
{\an8}<i>Oh look! Okay! Wait!</i>

579
00:43:07,791 --> 00:43:08,791
<i>Look out!</i>

580
00:43:25,708 --> 00:43:27,625
<i>Mmm.</i>

581
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:43,958
<i>Look,</i>

582
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:47,875
<i>I know I'm not the Leo you knew
in the future, and maybe I never will be.</i>

583
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,625
<i>This whole time
I was sure my family needed me,</i>

584
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:52,916
<i>but the truth is I need them.</i>

585
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:56,625
<i>If we're gonna survive this,
we have to do it together.</i>

586
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:14,833
<i>Hull integrity, 4%.
Breach imminent. Good luck.</i>

587
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:18,416
<i>Whew, good.
We have an imminent amount of time.</i>

588
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,833
<i>"Imminent" means "soon," Mikey.</i>

589
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:27,208
<i>Don't worry.
I'll save us with my mystic hands.</i>

590
00:44:34,166 --> 00:44:35,166
<i>Ah?</i>

591
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:38,291
<i>Casey must have been wrong about me.</i>

592
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,750
<i>This is it, Donnie.</i>

593
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:44,708
<i>We're gonna get crushed!</i>

594
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,416
<i>- Knock-knock!
- April?</i>

595
00:44:48,541 --> 00:44:50,791
<i>Anyone order a rescue?</i>

596
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:00,666
<i>Boom goes the herbicide!</i>

597
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:10,291
<i>April!</i>

598
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,291
<i>You saved us!</i>

599
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:14,416
<i>Uncomfortable with emotion!</i>

600
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,250
<i>Where is Leo? And, uh, Future Boy?</i>

601
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:19,333
<i>Somewhere in there.</i>

602
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,750
<i>Faster! They're this way.</i>

603
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:25,250
<i>I can smell them.</i>

604
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:28,333
<i>She found us! We gotta move now.</i>

605
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:33,708
<i>Oh man,
is this what the future looks like?</i>

606
00:45:33,791 --> 00:45:36,958
<i>Nope, the future is worse. Much worse.</i>

607
00:45:37,541 --> 00:45:39,333
<i>Donnie, Mikey, do you read me?</i>

608
00:45:39,416 --> 00:45:40,916
<i>Come in, Leo.</i>

609
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,416
<i>Donnie, where are you?</i>

610
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,416
<i>We've extracted from the subway
and are ascending a staircase.</i>

611
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,166
<i>I'm getting a lot of interference,
but if you hold still,</i>

612
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:51,500
<i>I can triangulate your position
using a complex geo-location algorithm.</i>

613
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:54,916
<i>- Uh, Donnie?
- Odd numbers, primes, no... almost.</i>

614
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,958
<i>Almost!</i>

615
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:00,666
<i>Ugh. I never get to use my algorithm.</i>

616
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,958
<i>Man, I am so glad you guys aren't dead.</i>

617
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:05,041
<i>Ditto.</i>

618
00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:09,541
<i>Okay, before this gets too mushy,
we need to locate Raph.</i>

619
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:11,583
<i>Can you tell me if he's in the building?</i>

620
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:14,208
<i>Bet your momma's
subatomic particles I can.</i>

621
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:17,000
<i>Got him! He's close.</i>

622
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:18,750
<i>He's almost on top of us.</i>

623
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:20,791
<i>Wait, he is on top of us.</i>

624
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:25,166
<i>Raph!</i>

625
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,750
<i>Quick, cut him down, get him out of there.</i>

626
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,750
<i>Huh?</i>

627
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:41,166
<i>Hang on. We got you. Almost there.</i>

628
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,500
<i>Raph?</i>

629
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
<i>Ah.</i>

630
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:25,416
<i>Surprise.</i>

631
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:27,958
<i>What did you do to my brother?</i>

632
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:29,458
<i>Improved him.</i>

633
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,833
<i>Thank you for this.
We will be putting it to good use.</i>

634
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:57,625
<i>Come, the world awaits destruction.</i>

635
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:01,166
<i>Tear them apart!</i>

636
00:48:11,791 --> 00:48:13,041
<i>We gotta move.</i>

637
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,458
<i>- Leo, move!
- No!</i>

638
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:34,416
<i>A shame our brethren
didn't survive the prison dimension.</i>

639
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:40,500
<i>Then again, their weakness
has no place in my new Krang empire.</i>

640
00:48:46,416 --> 00:48:50,250
<i>Open and bring unto this world</i>

641
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:53,500
<i>the mighty power of Krang!</i>

642
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:38,958
<i>Warning! This is a warning!</i>

643
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:41,375
<i>...appears to be something
falling from the sky...</i>

644
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:43,458
<i>What?</i>

645
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:45,166
<i>Oh!</i>

646
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:22,958
<i>Begin!</i>

647
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,833
<i>What do we do now?</i>

648
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:15,750
<i>I fear we are lost.
The Krang are too powerful.</i>

649
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,250
<i>Maybe we could
change the future some other way.</i>

650
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:25,791
<i>Guys, it's time to face facts.
We can't change the future.</i>

651
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,375
<i>Says who?</i>

652
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:31,083
<i>Says the grandfather paradox,
says physical determinism,</i>

653
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:33,458
<i>says the space-time continuum.</i>

654
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:36,375
<i>Look, I didn't want it to be true, but...</i>

655
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:39,083
<i>...science.</i>

656
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:42,125
<i>That's it! Donnie's wrong.</i>

657
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:45,250
<i>The world is ending,
yet the barbs continue.</i>

658
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:48,625
<i>Don't you remember?
We already did change the future.</i>

659
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:51,958
<i>Raph never got kidnapped and
turned into a Krang zombie in your time.</i>

660
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:54,375
<i>- Right, Casey?
- No, he didn't.</i>

661
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:59,333
<i>- That means we did change the future!
- We're just in a different...</i>

662
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,375
<i>Bifurcated time branch?</i>

663
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,458
<i>Yes, yes, yes, that nerd thing.</i>

664
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:06,833
<i>You know what that means, right?
We still have hope!</i>

665
00:52:06,916 --> 00:52:09,375
<i>A ninja's greatest weapon.</i>

666
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:11,250
<i>Hey, I like that!</i>

667
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:15,125
<i>Look, I'm done
thinking I have all the answers.</i>

668
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:16,833
<i>I don't know how to beat the Krang,</i>

669
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:22,166
<i>but I do know our future
isn't written until we write it as a team.</i>

670
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,333
<i>So what do we got?</i>

671
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:26,458
<i>Maybe...</i>

672
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,291
<i>Maybe we don't have to beat them.</i>

673
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:31,791
<i>Can't we just send them
back to the prison dimension?</i>

674
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:35,875
<i>There's an idea! Donnie, what do those
big, beautiful eyebrows have to say?</i>

675
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:40,458
<i>If we got control of their ship,
we could send it back through the portal.</i>

676
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:43,125
<i>Yes! Yes! Now we're cooking. Who else?</i>

677
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:45,791
<i>If someone on the ground
can get to that key...</i>

678
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:47,750
<i>We can close the doorway.</i>

679
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:51,333
<i>And then bye-bye Krang forever, baby!</i>

680
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:56,833
<i>Exactly. What do you say, Donnie?
You ready to fly a space ship?</i>

681
00:52:57,416 --> 00:53:00,541
<i>Literally the greatest question
I have ever been asked.</i>

682
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:04,166
<i>All right, team, we have a plan.
Let's go save the world.</i>

683
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:07,583
<i>Wait, but what about Raph?</i>

684
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:15,833
<i>That big jerk may be
covered in goo and half alien,</i>

685
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:19,250
<i>but he's still our brother,
and I'm not giving up on him.</i>

686
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:20,958
<i>I'm not leaving him behind.</i>

687
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:54,083
<i>There's the key. Let's go.</i>

688
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,791
<i>Like Casey said, let's go!</i>

689
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:14,250
<i>I wish my tech was working!</i>

690
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:16,708
<i>Usually, my cardio is jet pack-assisted.</i>

691
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:19,166
<i>I'm not getting credit
for any of these steps!</i>

692
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:30,291
<i>Eugh.</i>

693
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:33,375
<i>Hey, question,
is it too late to join April's team?</i>

694
00:54:33,458 --> 00:54:34,458
<i>Sh.</i>

695
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:38,625
<i>You two figure out
how to hijack this ship.</i>

696
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,166
<i>I'm gonna find Raph.</i>

697
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,208
<i>So how do we hack this thing?</i>

698
00:54:48,666 --> 00:54:50,333
<i>Best guess, main console?</i>

699
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:53,375
<i>Unfortunately, it'socupado.</i>

700
00:55:06,458 --> 00:55:08,166
<i>Uh, new plan.</i>

701
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,458
<i>Run!</i>

702
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,750
<i>Surprise. I've come for my brother.</i>

703
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:35,916
<i>Let me guess.</i>

704
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,708
<i>Duty.</i>

705
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:40,291
<i>He said doodie.</i>

706
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:54,583
<i>I see you got yourself an upgrade.</i>

707
00:55:55,916 --> 00:55:58,291
<i>You'll pay for what you have done to me!</i>

708
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:05,958
<i>This psycho routine is a little thin.
Where's the character development?</i>

709
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:14,125
<i>Leo's counting on us
to get to that key.</i>

710
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,666
<i>I think I have an idea.</i>

711
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,125
<i>Cover me!</i>

712
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,916
<i>Raph, you're coming with me,
whether you like it or not.</i>

713
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:33,041
<i>I don't want to fight you,
but I will if I have to.</i>

714
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:38,000
<i>Oh, you will have to.</i>

715
00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:03,708
<i>Bravo, Mikey!</i>

716
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:07,250
<i>There's no buttons,
or computers, or anything.</i>

717
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:10,333
<i>Just a lot of drippy,
ooey-gooey disgustingness.</i>

718
00:57:10,416 --> 00:57:12,083
<i>I don't know how to hack in...</i>

719
00:57:13,625 --> 00:57:15,625
<i>Oh God, I know what I have to do.</i>

720
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:16,708
<i>What?</i>

721
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:20,708
<i>No, I don't think I can do this.</i>

722
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:22,916
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

723
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,833
<i>Oh no!</i>

724
00:57:23,916 --> 00:57:26,833
<i>That's... so gross!</i>

725
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:28,625
<i>- I can't do it.
- I believe in you!</i>

726
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:31,166
<i>- No, it's my worst nightmare.
- I know.</i>

727
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,000
<i>I'm doing it! I'm doing it!</i>

728
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:44,666
<i>Raph, I know you're in there somewhere.
You've gotta snap out of this!</i>

729
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,708
<i>Do you feel what
the power of the Krang can do?</i>

730
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:53,000
<i>I am saving this weak planet!</i>

731
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:55,666
<i>I am a gift!</i>

732
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16,833
<i>It's not working.
I need more of a connection.</i>

733
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:19,333
<i>Mikey, take off my battle shell.</i>

734
00:58:19,416 --> 00:58:22,333
<i>No, you're too vulnerable
with just your soft shell.</i>

735
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,250
<i>There's no time, hurry.</i>

736
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:46,125
<i>Donnie?</i>

737
00:58:56,791 --> 00:59:00,416
<i>Mikey, I am...</i>

738
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:03,000
<i>a spaceship!</i>

739
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:05,208
<i>Oh! Ah!</i>

740
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:11,208
<i>I'm trying to save you, you idiot!</i>

741
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:13,625
<i>Why do you have to make things so hard?</i>

742
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:22,708
<i>Ah.</i>

743
00:59:24,833 --> 00:59:28,500
<i>You want to keep coming at me?
Go ahead. I'm done fighting you.</i>

744
00:59:33,583 --> 00:59:34,583
<i>What?</i>

745
00:59:40,666 --> 00:59:41,666
<i>No!</i>

746
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:54,208
<i>Finally, man and machine</i>

747
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:58,833
<i>entwixed in perfect bionic synergy!</i>

748
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:08,500
<i>How dare you desecrate Krang's ship!</i>

749
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:29,916
<i>Donnie, Mikey!</i>

750
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:39,916
<i>I don't want to fight anymore.</i>

751
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,666
<i>I was fighting you
because I didn't understand you,</i>

752
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,750
<i>but now I get it.</i>

753
01:00:50,791 --> 01:00:54,166
<i>I always figured you were mad because
you didn't like the way I did things.</i>

754
01:01:02,416 --> 01:01:04,833
<i>But when I see what's happening to you,</i>

755
01:01:04,916 --> 01:01:06,625
<i>and what's happening to them...</i>

756
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:09,583
<i>I realized it wasn't about me.</i>

757
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:13,916
<i>You didn't yell because you were mad,
you yelled because you were scared.</i>

758
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,250
<i>It's scary to be responsible
for the lives you protect.</i>

759
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:20,916
<i>Your team... your family,</i>

760
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:25,375
<i>but we do it anyway
because that's what it means to be a hero.</i>

761
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:31,041
<i>If this is it,
I want you to know I finally understand.</i>

762
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:33,958
<i>And I'm sorry.</i>

763
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:54,791
<i>Raph, Raph, there you are! Come back!
Your family needs you.</i>

764
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,500
<i>- Leo?
- Yes!</i>

765
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:16,875
<i>Mikey, Donnie, we can fight this.</i>

766
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:19,875
<i>Raph's doing it for us,
so we do it for him.</i>

767
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:22,916
<i>That alien jerk face thinks we're weak</i>

768
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:26,583
<i>because he hasn't seen what we can do...</i>

769
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:30,583
<i>when we fight together!</i>

770
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:37,750
<i>It's pointless to resist Krang.</i>

771
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:39,333
<i>Give up!</i>

772
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:43,833
<i>You will be consumed like
everyone else on this pathetic planet!</i>

773
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:45,833
<i>Fat chance.</i>

774
01:02:45,916 --> 01:02:48,458
<i>We're not like
everyone else on this planet.</i>

775
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:49,958
<i>We are...</i>

776
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:51,708
<i>...the Teenage...</i>

777
01:02:51,791 --> 01:02:53,625
<i>- ...Mutant...
- ...Ninja...</i>

778
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:55,625
<i>...Turtles!</i>

779
01:03:32,291 --> 01:03:35,333
<i>If this isn't the poster shot,
someone's getting fired.</i>

780
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:38,166
<i>Oh, we are not done yet.</i>

781
01:03:41,291 --> 01:03:45,291
<i>April O'Neil!</i>

782
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:48,166
<i>That's payback.</i>

783
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:51,250
<i>Keep her under that building
until I bring it down.</i>

784
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:06,875
<i>Yeah!</i>

785
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:16,333
<i>Casey, get out of there!</i>

786
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,541
<i>Commander O'Neil!</i>

787
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:40,833
<i>Nice shot.</i>

788
01:04:43,708 --> 01:04:47,500
<i>Donnie's almost got the ship to
the other side. I have to get to the key.</i>

789
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,541
<i>See ya.</i>

790
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:55,916
<i>Come in, Sensei, it's Casey.
Can you hear me?</i>

791
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,208
<i>Come in, Sensei! Can you hear me?</i>

792
01:05:07,708 --> 01:05:08,708
<i>Ya!</i>

793
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,250
<i>Ah!</i>

794
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:32,166
<i>Okay! Donnie!</i>

795
01:05:33,458 --> 01:05:34,791
<i>Cowabunga!</i>

796
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:39,041
<i>Flip-o-rama!</i>

797
01:05:40,458 --> 01:05:41,708
<i>Let's roll.</i>

798
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:53,500
<i>Ka-zoom!</i>

799
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:15,166
<i>Raph, go.</i>

800
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:16,833
<i>On it!</i>

801
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,583
<i>Gotcha! Don't worry, Donnie!</i>

802
01:06:28,666 --> 01:06:32,000
<i>This is not a hug. It's a rescue!</i>

803
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:40,625
<i>Where are we? Staten Island?</i>

804
01:06:40,708 --> 01:06:42,666
<i>Oh, gross.</i>

805
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:46,458
<i>So how would everyone rate
that rescue experience? Unsatisfied?</i>

806
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:49,875
<i>Very unsatisfied?
Wish Donnie would have done it? Um-hum?</i>

807
01:06:49,958 --> 01:06:51,666
<i>Donnie.</i>

808
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,250
<i>Leo's still up there.</i>

809
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:18,125
<i>Casey. Casey, come in.</i>

810
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:24,750
<i>Sensei, I'm here.
And I've got eyes on the key.</i>

811
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:29,625
<i>Tell me when you're home free,
and I'll pull the plug.</i>

812
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:39,041
<i>Casey, listen to me.</i>

813
01:07:39,125 --> 01:07:41,458
<i>When I get to the other side,
you close that door.</i>

814
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,625
<i>What? Sensei, no!</i>

815
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:49,041
<i>Casey, it's the only way.
He's too strong.</i>

816
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:52,708
<i>He's not gonna stay on the other side
unless I keep him there.</i>

817
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:55,250
<i>There has to be another way!</i>

818
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:58,250
<i>We tried everything, Case.
This is the only way.</i>

819
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:02,125
<i>Leo, please don't do this! Leo!</i>

820
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:08,041
<i>You're one to talk, big bro.
Hero moves are totally your style.</i>

821
01:08:11,666 --> 01:08:15,958
<i>Outmatched and alone, yet you persist.</i>

822
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:17,041
<i>For what?</i>

823
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,875
<i>Honor, redemption?</i>

824
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:24,500
<i>Sacrifice? All meaningless.</i>

825
01:08:25,375 --> 01:08:27,083
<i>We'll see about that.</i>

826
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:50,250
<i>Leo, please!
I can't lose you again.</i>

827
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:55,041
<i>Hey, future me would be real
proud of you. I'm proud of you.</i>

828
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:58,166
<i>Weak words, weak actions.</i>

829
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:02,833
<i>I have forever known
what you fail to understand,</i>

830
01:09:02,916 --> 01:09:06,500
<i>strength always prevails!</i>

831
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:11,250
<i>What you fail to understand
is I missed on purpose.</i>

832
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:18,750
<i>No, enough of your little tricks.</i>

833
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:23,000
<i>Casey, close the portal now.</i>

834
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:24,375
<i>What?</i>

835
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:37,000
<i>No! Let go of me!</i>

836
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:38,833
<i>Casey, please.</i>

837
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:17,208
<i>You've been portal chopped.</i>

838
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:37,375
<i>You...</i>

839
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:45,500
<i>You've ruined everything!</i>

840
01:10:45,583 --> 01:10:51,666
<i>And now... my wrath
will be reserved for you alone.</i>

841
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:57,791
<i>You think you've won,
you wretched little pest?</i>

842
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:19,458
<i>Wipe that grin off your face!</i>

843
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:33,083
<i>Mikey, it's over.</i>

844
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,250
<i>Leo never gave up on us.</i>

845
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:39,250
<i>I'm not giving up on him.</i>

846
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:49,791
<i>Whoa. Mikey,
whatever you're doing, don't stop!</i>

847
01:12:57,958 --> 01:13:00,666
<i>We're here, Mikey. Together.</i>

848
01:13:21,041 --> 01:13:23,291
<i>Took you guys long enough.</i>

849
01:13:32,458 --> 01:13:33,458
<i>Leo!</i>

850
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:08,333
<i>Huh?</i>

851
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:10,208
<i>- Leo?
- Hey.</i>

852
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:15,083
<i>Eww! Are we in Staten Island?</i>

853
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:17,000
<i>- Come here!
- Aww!</i>

854
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:30,083
<i>No pictures.</i>

855
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:49,666
<i>So this is "grabbing a slice"?</i>

856
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:50,791
<i>I don't get it.</i>

857
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:52,458
<i>Wait for it.</i>

858
01:14:54,666 --> 01:14:56,000
<i>Mmm.</i>

859
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:58,333
<i>So much better than rats!</i>

860
01:14:58,416 --> 01:14:59,416
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.</i>

861
01:14:59,958 --> 01:15:03,791
<i>Hey, the rest of the world we saved
is pretty great too.</i>

862
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:06,291
<i>All right, everybody, look up here.</i>

863
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:17,250
<i>April, you just got a message
from someone named "Cassandra."</i>

864
01:15:19,125 --> 01:15:20,333
<i>Whoa!</i>

865
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,166
<i>Looks like our friend Cassandra
has been busy.</i>

866
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:25,916
<i>That's my mom!</i>

867
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,166
<i>There goes the space-time continuum.</i>

868
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:30,750
<i>You did it, little brother.</i>

869
01:15:31,416 --> 01:15:32,708
<i>You really did it.</i>

870
01:15:33,416 --> 01:15:34,416
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

871
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:37,166
<i>This wasn't about me.</i>

872
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:40,791
<i>It was about all of us
doing what needed to be done</i>

873
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:42,125
<i>because we're heroes.</i>

874
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:45,500
<i>You said "heroes."</i>

875
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:54,416
<i>There it is, gentlemen, our home.</i>

876
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,916
<i>What a town.</i>

877
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,041
<i>Beautiful.</i>

878
01:15:57,666 --> 01:16:01,750
<i>And if it needs defending,
we'll always rise to the challenge.</i>

879
01:16:02,375 --> 01:16:06,166
<i>Speaking of which,
you know what challenge I'm gonna rise to?</i>

880
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,458
<i>- Beating that record!
- Yay!</i>

881
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:11,000
<i>No way! No, okay, fine.</i>

882
01:16:12,166 --> 01:16:14,625
<i>All right, Big Raphie, let's do it!</i>

883
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:20,208
<i>Raph! Raph! Raph! Raph!
