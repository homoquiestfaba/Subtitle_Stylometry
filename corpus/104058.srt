1
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,516
You want my money,
best throw some elbow into that.

2
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,029
$1.50. That's 2-bits shy a car wash.

3
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,838
$1.50 each.

4
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,833
No, man. You must have got me confused
with some other idiot.

5
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,669
The rain's doing half your work.

6
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,075
Look here.

7
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,152
Bobby Earl, the cultured pearl.

8
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,389
What's up, Gomer?

9
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,708
Boys, take a break.

10
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,272
Bobby Earl, we got to talk.

11
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,955
-I said quit!
-Talk about what?

12
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,478
Take a ride.

13
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,471
-A ride.
-Please.

14
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,990
It's Wilcox.

15
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,514
I need a tech team at Ferguson's place.

16
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,913
What kind of car is that?

17
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,588
Leave him be!

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,159
You cracker son of a bitch!

19
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,310
-I should lock you up!
-Grandma, go inside.

20
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,312
-Can't you ijust leave him be?
-I'm all right, Grandma.

21
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,828
It's all right.

22
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,712
I'i be back before supper.

23
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,358
Grandma, why are they taking Bobby Earl?

24
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,838
Give me that head!

25
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,869
Let's shake up that cage, son!

26
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,634
You're not getting that meat
tenderized enough?

27
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,795
Sit down!

28
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,916
Let's see what else we got to start with.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,911
Look here, Bobby Earl!

30
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,750
Get the fuck up.

31
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,636
I'll ask you nicely, son.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,118
Did you fuck her before
or after you filleted her?

33
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,519
Country-ass motherfucker.

34
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,796
"Asshole," is it?

35
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,995
I'i show you!

36
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,871
Fucking asshole!

37
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,999
"At the first official electrocution in 1890...

38
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,278
"... the victim had the electrodes
removed from his head...

39
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,271
"...after 15 seconds.

40
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,439
"Suddenly he opened his eyes
and began gasping for air...

41
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,558
"...apparently unaware
that he was supposed to be dead.

42
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,114
"The warden and all present
lost their wits...

43
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,158
"...before calling for the current
to be turned back on.

44
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,556
"Witnesses describe a blue flame
playing about the base of the spine.

45
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,270
"This time the electricity flowed
for four minutes.

46
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,712
"Over the years, other witnesses
to electrocutions...

47
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,997
"...have described the prisoner
catching fire...

48
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,869
"... the electricity so powerful...

49
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,397
"... that the eyeballs pop out
onto the cheeks...

50
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,194
"...a sound like bacon frying.

51
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,276
"During the autopsy, the liver is so hot
that it can"t be touched by human hands.

52
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,994
"Despite its best efforts,
this justice system has killed...

53
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,594
"...at least 23 innocent men...

54
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,718
"...and sentences blacks who kill whites...

55
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,436
"...seven times more than whites
who kill blacks. "

56
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,394
1890...

57
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,551
... to the 1990s.

58
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,434
Over 100 years of progress.

59
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,079
You paint a grim picture indeed, Professor.

60
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,959
I wish you had been as vivid
describing the victims.

61
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,108
They were people who suffered
far more cruel and unusual punishment...

62
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,033
... than any our penal system
could even imagine.

63
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,551
-I refuse to believe--
-Let me finish.

64
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,199
-Let me finish.
-Very well.

65
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,840
I submit to you, the issue is revenge.

66
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,677
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth, if you will.

67
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,149
No, I refuse to believe
in any god or government...

68
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,074
...which is willing to trade
torture for torture...

69
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,673
...or death for death.

70
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,157
In closing, Professor...

71
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,873
...if your wife...

72
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,713
...or child were murdered...

73
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,830
...how would you feel
about that last statement of yours?

74
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,998
How would I feel?

75
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,836
Very much the same as yourself.

76
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,155
But I would not want
their deaths avenged...

77
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,834
...by a system as cruel
and capricious as this.

78
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,795
-You changed my mind.
-I thought I had you.

79
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,674
-They're going to kill my boy.
-Excuse me?

80
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,152
My grandson's in a Florida prison
on Death Row for something he didn't do.

81
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,999
Good luck. I'll see you in Washington.

82
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,869
I'm sorry. I no longer practice law.

83
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,112
He said to me,
"Go up to Cambridge, Massachusetts.

84
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,191
"Find Mr. Paul Armstrong...

85
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,118
"...and give him this."

86
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,793
Well, thank you.
I'll read it and get back to you.

87
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,279
Read it now.

88
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,669
Come far?

89
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,398
Ochopee, Florida.

90
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,474
A long way.

91
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,308
"Victim was white. I am black.
No food or water."

92
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,715
Beaten?

93
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,715
By Mr. Tanny Brown, the black-hatingest
police in Everglade County.

94
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,793
"Murder one.

95
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,909
"Death penalty."

96
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,877
The white ijudge was 87.

97
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,589
He called Bobby Earl an animal,
ought to be shot.

98
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,992
It's 25 years since I practiced law.

99
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,637
If you say no, he said to go to Princeton,
New Jersey and find Mr. Harry Gilyard.

100
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,435
A good man.

101
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,755
But he said to come to you first.

102
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,232
I'm sorry, I can't.

103
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,038
Can I drive you somewhere?

104
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,639
Nowhere.

105
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,116
There a 2:00 a.m. bus to Princeton
from the Trailways station.

106
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,198
I can get there by myself.

107
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,630
Thank you for your time.

108
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,388
No, you keep it.

109
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,436
It's got your name on it.

110
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,994
Daddy!

111
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,232
Wonderful, wonderful.

112
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,755
Carry on.

113
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,268
Where's Mommy?

114
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,753
-Hi.
-What happened to you?

115
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,998
I was working in ijuvenile detention center
this morning with this kid, Carlos.

116
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,713
He was in for dealing.

117
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,912
Usual rap sheet: misdemeanors,
history of drug use.

118
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,671
Half-hour in, I ask about his mother.

119
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,270
And he goes berserk.
I'm on my back seeing stars.

120
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,868
A day at the office.

121
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,397
An hour later,
I'm standing in front of the ijudge...

122
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,718
...convincing her he's perfect
for the Crossroads program instead of ijail.

123
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,032
How did you explain the eye?

124
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,430
I told her my husband's a wife beater.

125
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,559
Thank you very much.

126
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,350
Why don't you go back to being a lawyer?

127
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,635
It is safer.

128
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,360
For who? Me or the bad guys?

129
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,794
More popcorn, please.

130
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,434
Daddy will bring it.

131
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,710
Paul, how did the debate go?

132
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,791
Little old lady showed up tonight.

133
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,271
Tells me her grandson's on Death Row
down in Florida.

134
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,555
A black kid. Went to Cornell.

135
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,228
Can I see it?

136
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,076
Back to the salt mines.

137
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,037
He needs a Iawyer...

138
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,720
...not a teacher. And I need a drink.

139
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,029
Did you really read this?
Maybe this one is worth checking out.

140
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,396
Why don't you check it out?
You know Everglade County.

141
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,751
Can we sleep outside?

142
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,830
No way.

143
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,309
I'd sooner go to hell
than into another courtroom.

144
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,590
This would be really good for you.

145
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,398
Put you in the real world.

146
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,998
Why is every fucking thing the real world
except teaching?

147
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,998
That's the real world?

148
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,472
He's on Death Row. He's asking you
to put your money where your mouth is.

149
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,592
All I'm saying is that...

150
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,832
...every once in a while
you got to get a little bloody.

151
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,758
It's good for the soul.

152
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,117
-I see them.
-There they are.

153
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,759
Grandma!

154
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,634
Dad.

155
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,433
What's that on your face?

156
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,794
Hi, sweetness.

157
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,309
Welcome.

158
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,716
It's not a bad paper as papers go,
but that's not saying much.

159
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,750
Delores, sweetheart.

160
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,314
Hey, Mr. Phil.

161
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,311
It's been a long time.

162
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,749
Paul Armstrong.

163
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,029
My son-in-Iaw.

164
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,831
Delores Rodriguez,
keeper of archives, news-trivia expert.

165
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,354
Buried three husbands.

166
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,273
Were it not for Libby, I could well be No. 4.

167
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,637
How is Libby's health?

168
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,115
It's good.

169
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,675
Pity.

170
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,515
Business.

171
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,068
Paul needs information
on the Joanie Shriver murder.

172
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,913
That poor kid from Ochopee?

173
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,951
Watch your back in here.

174
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,998
We are on-line back to 1985.

175
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,150
Everything before that is on microfiche.

176
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,390
I'i see what else I can find.

177
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,710
How long?

178
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,153
That depends. You'll be amazed
at what I can do with a little help.

179
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,278
Mr. Armstrong.

180
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,679
Sergeant Rogers?

181
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,591
Raise your arms, please.

182
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,474
Tape recorder.

183
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,275
There you go.

184
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,396
Your first time, Mr. Armstrong?

185
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,558
Buzz when you want out.

186
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,836
If you're unable to buzz,
don't worry about it.

187
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,272
Sweet Jesus.

188
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,709
The old girl said
you'd be coming up in here.

189
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,789
I said, "No.

190
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,393
"No, Grandma, he's too busy...

191
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,597
"...to come all the way from Harvard
just to give me his time."

192
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,999
But praise God...

193
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,189
...here you is.

194
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,797
If I really talked with
that verbal buck-and-shuffle...

195
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,834
...I'd be free today.

196
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,635
What's your game?

197
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,474
It's no game.

198
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,990
Funny thing about
small-town Florida people.

199
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,991
Like crabs in a bucket, black or white.

200
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,550
One tries to climb out, the others
hop on his back to put him back in.

201
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,431
Souls of Black Folk, DuBois.

202
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,035
I've read it.

203
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,799
I'm impressed.

204
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,475
Good.

205
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,710
I've always been that climb-out crab.

206
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,159
My mother OD'd on heroin
when I was 13 up in Newark.

207
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,750
Grandma got me and brought me here.

208
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,956
I was high school valedictorian.

209
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,429
I got a full scholarship to Cornell, but...

210
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,550
...they treated me like an outsider.

211
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,399
How do you like Grandma?

212
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,392
She's something else.

213
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,909
She's very determined.
But why did you send her up to see me?

214
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,231
Because you are from a small town,
like me.

215
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,678
Fife, Scotland. First in your family
to attend a university.

216
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,440
Magna from Cambridge. Columbia Law.

217
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,915
Youngest assistant DA, 1960-69.

218
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,837
Joined a law firm, 1970.

219
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,273
1980 to the present...

220
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,073
...Harvard professor of Iaw...

221
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,197
...author of Process and Law,
and six books since.

222
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,349
I've read them all.

223
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,996
Enough.

224
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,149
Let's start.

225
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,035
Joanie Shriver.

226
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,710
The victim.

227
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,390
Eleven years old. White girl.

228
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,236
Snatched from the Ochopee
Elementary School, March 4, 1986.

229
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,039
Found a day later, raped and cut up
in the Glades.

230
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,839
A teacher ID'd the car
as somewhat like mine.

231
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,798
Officer Tanny Brown come and lock me up.

232
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,514
-I read the transcript.
-I'i tell you this:

233
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,957
Down here, if the chief head-banger
takes a dislike to you...

234
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,513
...your ass is his.

235
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,188
He's a nigger who likes being a big fish--

236
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,713
He's black?

237
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,795
Yes.

238
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,713
In the new South, they've got black cops
to torment your black ass.

239
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,472
It's called affirmative action.

240
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,512
Tell me about your confession.

241
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,955
My confession?

242
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,229
I was slapped.

243
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,033
I was punched.

244
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,918
Beaten with a phone book.

245
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,911
Made to piss myself, kicked.

246
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,639
Then Officer Brown...

247
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,709
...walked in.

248
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,308
Tanny, wait.

249
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,598
J.T., I need you to back me up
on this one here.

250
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,992
Prety Robert Earl.

251
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,159
I want to ask you....

252
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,755
Last time.

253
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,751
I told you. I swear.

254
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,478
I don't know this girl.

255
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,949
I have no reason to ie. I don't know her.

256
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,148
Come on, talk to me.

257
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,469
Come on, stop.

258
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,033
What did you say to her?

259
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,509
How'd you get her in the car? Say, "Ah."

260
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,919
Talk to me.

261
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,870
Talk to me.

262
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,390
I hate prety motherfuckers ike you.

263
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,751
I don't know no Joanie Shriver.

264
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,918
Pretty motherfucker, talk to me.

265
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,513
Ain't so pretty now, are you?

266
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,190
They had me in there 22 hours.

267
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,000
No food, no water, no sleep.

268
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,436
No bathroom.

269
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,828
You drove her...

270
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,235
...to an isolated section of the Everglades...

271
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,755
...approximately two and a half miles
southeast of her home.

272
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,995
Yes.

273
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,749
Did you drive her to that Iocation...

274
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,037
...with the full intent to kidnap, rape...

275
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,430
...sodomize and kill her?

276
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,071
Speak into the microphone.

277
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,069
Yes.

278
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,398
You feel better now, don't you?

279
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,515
You're a strange fruit, Robert Earl.

280
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,516
Strange fruit, indeed.

281
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,670
I'd have confessed to anything.
They spoon-fed me to the Row.

282
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,796
It's your word against theirs.

283
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,193
I didn't do it.

284
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,555
She's a pretty thing, but you couldn't tell it
when they brought her in.

285
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,075
Bobby Earl was a very angry boy.

286
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,992
Parts of her chest and abdomen were
so badly damaged...

287
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,674
...hard to tell how many times
she was stabbed.

288
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,953
The cuts were...

289
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,198
...Iong, shallow at the ends,
deep in the middle.

290
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,591
The wounds curved upward.

291
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,876
-A half-moon shape.
-Like a scimitar?

292
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,836
Yeah.

293
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,399
But miniature.

294
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,551
I'd say six inches, hilt to tip.

295
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,198
Your autopsy report...

296
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,675
...states that the girl was raped.

297
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,671
But there's no record of any semen.

298
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,153
There wasn't any.

299
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,355
There wasn't?

300
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,312
No. She was penetrated.

301
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,796
With no semen, how did you establish
the O-positive blood?

302
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,590
We got that from the teeth and gums.

303
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,233
You said you examined Bobby Earl's hand...

304
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,357
...and found cuts that could be attributed
to teeth marks.

305
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,835
That's right.

306
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,388
You never matched the dental plate
to the cuts.

307
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,671
I didn't need to, once he confessed.

308
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,955
Did you know he was beaten for 22 hours
before he gave his confession?

309
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,069
So he says.

310
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,950
The cuts on his hand could have been
from the beating.

311
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,389
How convenient.

312
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,435
Armstrong?

313
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,677
Yes.

314
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,268
I'm Detective Wilcox.

315
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,548
Spoke on the phone about hooking up
with Tanny Brown?

316
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,868
Yes. J.T. Wilcox.

317
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,275
That's right.

318
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,196
Tanny said he'd hook up with you
this afternoon if you're still around.

319
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,794
Anything I can do?

320
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,071
If you have time later, thank you.

321
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,280
You got a busy afternoon lined up,
Mr. Armstrong.

322
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,712
Some people to see, yes.

323
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,599
Ever been here before?

324
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,430
No.

325
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,235
Come on. It's a nice little town.

326
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,430
How's old Bobby Earl doing?

327
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,989
He's holding it together.

328
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,474
"Holding it together."

329
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,034
I'd expect he would be
"holding it together."

330
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,111
Cold-hearted son of a bitch.

331
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,310
Stayed right frosty to the end.

332
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,559
Get that vehicle back in the street, Charlie.
That's the last time I'll tell you.

333
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,954
Sorry, J.T.

334
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,673
Then he just started spitting it out,
like a goddamn machine.

335
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,879
Scared me to death.

336
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,318
Scared you to death?

337
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,871
What did Bobby Earl tell you?

338
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,038
About the bare-assed light bulb
at 4:00 a.m.?

339
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,590
I beat on him with a rubber hose?

340
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,193
How about a phone book?

341
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,831
White pages or yellow pages?

342
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,873
Mr. Armstrong?

343
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,078
Now, you listen to me.

344
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,192
Do you think if I'd gotten physical
with Bobby Earl...

345
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,792
...he wouldn't be wearing my anger
all over him at that arraignment?

346
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,874
What do you think, Professor?

347
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,074
I'm impressed.

348
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,312
You have a nice day now.

349
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,553
Harvard University. Do tell.

350
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,191
I'm a graduate of Florida State.

351
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,469
Bobby Earl Ferguson.

352
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,952
Change of venue, denied.

353
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,640
Motion to suppress a confession, denied.

354
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,790
Objection to an all-white jury, overruled.

355
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,233
Noted for the record.

356
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,479
I said, "You'll have to plead guilty,
take a 25-year hit.

357
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,630
"You'll have a life left when you come out."

358
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,359
He says, "But, sir, I didn't do it."

359
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,514
So he made you go to trial?

360
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,914
This matching blood statement
by Dr. Doliveau...

361
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,592
...why didn't you challenge it?

362
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,676
Even us backwoods
FIorida State Law School alumni know...

363
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,832
...that an O-positive match
doesn't mean anything...

364
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,833
...unless you get genetic screening
or an enzyme-base analysis.

365
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,918
You just narrowed it down
to 40 million suspects.

366
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,232
How did this testimony
survive cross-examination?

367
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,831
Half the people in the courtroom knew
that woman well.

368
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,109
She's known here as a very fine physician.

369
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,239
And a doctor is a god.

370
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,588
You know that.

371
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,316
Pathetic.

372
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,078
Jury didn't care.

373
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,352
I'll tell you, worst thing in that courtroom
was Bobby Earl himself.

374
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,232
He sat there, day after day,
looking guilty as hell.

375
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,878
It's not a popularity contest.

376
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,197
I find that a naive statement, Counselor.

377
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,190
Is that what you teach your law students:

378
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,470
"The truth will prevail"?

379
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,749
When's the last time you tried a case?

380
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,958
It's been 25 years.

381
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,958
Does that make you feel beter?

382
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,355
Hell.

383
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,478
Hang dog, show dog,
I don't think it'd make any difference...

384
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,348
...if Bobby Earl was
a 6'4" golden-haired Caucasian...

385
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,235
...who just quarterbacked Florida State
past Miami, 62-0 in the Cotton Bowl.

386
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,830
That jury won't disregard
the boy's own words.

387
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,391
His confession was coerced.

388
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,469
Why didn't you get an expert
to analyze his voice on tape?

389
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,510
I tried, sir.

390
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,869
Truly, I tried.

391
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,916
I know my job, Mr. Armstrong.

392
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,911
What you're not hearing is the fact...

393
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,311
...that people were sick with grief
over that poor little girl.

394
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,272
They wanted their revenge!

395
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,753
The end.

396
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,995
Mr. McNair.

397
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,598
Many thanks for your time.

398
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,033
No matter what you think...

399
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,511
...I defended that boy pro bono because
everybody has a right to legal counsel.

400
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,631
I paid for it dearly. I've Iost half
my business because I tried to defend him.

401
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,039
And he got the chair.

402
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,796
Imagine what it'd be like for me here
if I'd gotten him acquitted.

403
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,799
We always have a teacher here
at 3:00 to make sure...

404
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,668
... the boys don"t get into horseplay
or the girls while away the afternoon...

405
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,796
...gossiping and giggling on the corner.

406
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,119
Horseplay. Gossip.

407
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,315
Sweet.

408
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,549
That day it was about 3: 10.

409
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,391
Most everyone was gone.

410
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,031
I saw her by the banyan tree.

411
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,074
She walked past the car, then turned...

412
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,109
...ike someone in the car called her.

413
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,558
She walked back...

414
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,631
...and before she got in....

415
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,435
God.

416
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,912
I go to bed with this every night.
Her waving.

417
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,039
The car was parked under that tree?

418
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,553
Right like that there.

419
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,073
That far away?

420
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,549
When did the police show you the car
for identification?

421
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,554
The police? They didn't.
They just showed me a photo.

422
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,875
A photo?

423
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,715
Really?

424
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,477
-From what angle?
-Angle?

425
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,719
Front, rear, side?

426
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,235
Side.

427
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,589
But you couldn't see the side from here.
Not if it was in that position.

428
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,349
It seemed ike the car to me.

429
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,631
I was solid to myself when I said it.

430
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,070
I understand.

431
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,115
No, you don't!

432
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,957
You're tearing open a wound, coming here.

433
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,236
I'm only trying to get at what happened.

434
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,711
I am sorry for your grief.

435
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,112
Thanks for your time.

436
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,469
Miss Conklin...

437
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,437
...may I ask you one last question?

438
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,593
What color is that car?

439
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,475
Midnight blue.

440
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,754
Midnight blue.

441
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,513
Not dark blue? BIack?

442
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,669
Midnight blue.

443
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,514
How can you be so sure?

444
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,512
Because that's Tanny Brown's car.
Everyone knows that.

445
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,870
Thank you.

446
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,955
Come on in.

447
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,356
Tanny Brown.

448
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,109
Paul Armstrong.

449
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,154
You're trying to get Robert Earl
off the Row?

450
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,195
No.

451
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,109
I'm just trying to get some information.

452
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,235
Information?

453
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,193
Well, fair enough.

454
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,758
Let's get you some information.

455
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,272
-The girl got into the car right here.
-I know.

456
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,352
All right, fasten your seat belt.

457
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,995
Watch carefully.

458
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,470
Robert Earl made this right...

459
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,438
...still headed towards the girl's house.

460
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,835
See that house with the blue trim?

461
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,994
That's hers.

462
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,799
She'd wanted to go that way,
but he took her this way.

463
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,832
That's where he popped her.

464
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,238
He's a prety son of a bitch, but he's mean.

465
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,559
He's real mean.

466
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,190
Scream!

467
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,314
Scream!

468
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,829
I can't breathe.

469
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,629
Come on, big man like you.
You can scream louder than that.

470
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,110
Stop!

471
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,360
What the fuck was that nonsense about?

472
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,550
Trying to get you some information.

473
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,836
That is why you're here, right?

474
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,391
You be careful.
You're way beyond your perimeters.

475
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,155
Look around you, Mr. Armstrong.
Look where you are.

476
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,511
You smack dab in the middle of hell.

477
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,111
Took only five minutes to get here,
and nobody can hear you scream for help...

478
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,710
...Iet alone an 1 1-year-old girl.

479
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,113
Getting the picture?

480
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,157
See it with Joanie Shriver's eyes?

481
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,468
I get the point.

482
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,193
You get the point?

483
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,160
They come through here.
He was probably carrying her.

484
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,794
No defensive wounds on her hands.

485
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,953
We figure he knocked her out cold
in the car...

486
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,110
...at the intersection near her house.

487
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,036
Killed her while she was unconscious.

488
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,113
Otherwise, we'd have...

489
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,316
...seen stab wounds on her hands or...

490
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,079
...some of his skin underneath her nails.

491
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,869
This is it.

492
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,672
This is the kill spot.

493
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,192
The coroner said that the rape
was premortem, some of the cuts too.

494
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,590
But he did a lot of damage to her
after she was dead.

495
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,670
It's like he just went stone crazy.

496
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,948
He pushed her body in the water...

497
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,351
...and covered her up with some brush.

498
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,074
Want you to meet Joanie Shriver.

499
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,069
Take a look.

500
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,676
Daddy!

501
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,148
I"ll get Mommy.

502
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,151
No, don't get Mommy just yet.

503
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,114
I"ve been thinking about you
all day, sweetheart.

504
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,274
I love you very much.

505
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,713
I Iove you too.

506
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,438
Can you come back tonight?

507
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,515
No.

508
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,119
I can"t come back tonight.

509
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,876
So I want you to sleep with Mommy.

510
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,798
Daddy, I'm too old for that.

511
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,076
It's not for you, it's for her.

512
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,073
Do it for me.

513
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,633
I'i do it for you.

514
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,315
Good girl.

515
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,515
I Iove you.

516
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,673
I Iove you too.

517
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,950
Damn!

518
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,799
They hate long stories
about how you messed up their vehicles.

519
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,000
I hope you took that insurance option.

520
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,509
I like them lightning bolts, though.

521
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,115
Hell...

522
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,748
...you might not want to paint this over.

523
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,153
I know I wouldn't.

524
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,318
What do we got to do
to get rid of you, Mr. Armstrong?

525
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,478
Convince me that Bobby Earl
deserves to die.

526
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,354
Under the circumstances,
that's not possible.

527
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,516
So I'm not going to waste time trying.

528
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,472
I do have a question for you.

529
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,833
Are you aware that he was picked up
on kidnap charges in Dade County...

530
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,718
...a year prior to his arrest
for Joanie Shriver's murder?

531
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,712
Case went all the way to trial.

532
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,318
Yeah, I bet "Mr. Victim" forgot
to tell you about that.

533
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,078
And what was the result?

534
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,349
Prosecution's case collapsed
on a technicality, I believe.

535
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,310
Acquitted or thrown out of court?

536
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,154
Look, Armstrong...

537
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,958
...I knew Robert Earl was bad news
when I first saw him.

538
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,111
See him hanging around the school
when I'd pick up my girls.

539
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,759
Hanging around with his pretty-boy looks
and college-boy words.

540
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,234
He just felt wrong.

541
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,312
Wasn't just me who felt that way.
Every man in this department.

542
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,631
-Everybody in town.
-I still don't hear any evidence.

543
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,279
We didn't need any.

544
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,469
We had a confession.

545
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,438
If that's a confession...

546
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,873
...my ass is a banjo.

547
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:50,351
Damn arrogant Yankee son of a bitch!
He did it, goddamn it!

548
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,113
That man is an asshole!

549
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,872
Just calm the hell down.

550
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,397
You tell me that man never laid a hand
on Bobby Earl in 22 hours?

551
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,239
He slapped him once or twice.

552
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,913
Which was it?

553
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,795
You and I both know
it wasn't a textbook confession.

554
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,791
But it was enough to convict him!

555
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,309
This case hangs together by a thin thread.

556
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,999
You come down here, you start picking
at them threads, it'll fall apart.

557
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,434
I don't want that.

558
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,072
I tell you something else.

559
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,959
I want to see Robert Earl go to the chair
for what he did.

560
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,871
Tell me, what is your policy on taking guns
into the interrogation room?

561
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,674
Very simple: we don't.

562
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,359
May I see your left ankle?

563
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,349
PIease?

564
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,239
Looking for this?

565
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,151
I checked it with the duty sergeant.

566
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,874
You didn't take it out?

567
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,952
Point it at Bobby Earl?

568
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,034
No, sir.

569
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,989
You didn't stick it in his mouth
and play Russian roulette?

570
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,196
No, sir.

571
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,910
Then how did I know where to look for it?

572
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,514
You're back.

573
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,033
Let's get started.

574
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,516
Why didn't you tell me about your run-ins?

575
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,075
What run-ins?

576
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,956
Those times when Tanny tried to bust me?

577
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,309
Come on.

578
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,358
Tanny Brown had nothing to do
with your arrest in Dade County.

579
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,674
Dade County?

580
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,919
The charge was kidnapping.

581
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,914
That was bullshit.

582
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,078
Bullshit. I took some white girl
for a ride in my car.

583
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,508
It was just a ride.

584
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,597
In fact, she asked me for that ride.

585
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,319
The arresting cracker happened
to be a boyfriend of hers.

586
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,311
It should've been thrown out of court.

587
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,760
My ife was different after that.

588
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,710
How?

589
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,117
How was your life different after that,
if the case was thrown out?

590
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,272
They took away my scholarship.

591
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,550
A scholarship, for someone like me...

592
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,790
...is a trade-off, pure and simple.

593
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,600
I get a free ride, they get a better image.

594
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,993
As soon as I walked into court,
I couldn't live up to my end of the bargain.

595
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,753
They felt justified.

596
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,632
The same way Tanny felt justified
looking for me--

597
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,470
Wait.

598
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,708
I don't follow you.

599
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,280
Imagine a man, a very bad man...

600
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,831
...driving a car south,
driving off the turnpike into Ochopee.

601
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,115
He stops...

602
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,749
...takes a siesta under a banyan tree
just outside a schoolyard.

603
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,873
Then he spots a little girl.

604
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,839
Pretty little girl.

605
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,915
He talks her into his car.
He's friendly when he needs to be.

606
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,315
Then he does it.

607
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,836
Right there in the Glades.

608
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,514
He drives on and never gives it
another thought.

609
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,710
Go on.

610
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,439
That very bad man moves on
down the line.

611
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,873
A waitress in the Keys...

612
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,555
...two tourists in Lakeland,
a prostitute in Tampa, and finally...

613
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,273
...he gets sloppy.

614
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,913
Big-time sloppy.

615
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,753
That's murder one.

616
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,271
That's the Row. Death Row.

617
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,390
He's here?

618
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,040
Yes. And what does he find
when he gets here?

619
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,432
A neighbor on the Row
who's in for killing a little girl.

620
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,597
Yeah, a little blonde girl down in Ochopee.

621
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,915
All cut up and thrown in the swamps.

622
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,955
And he says:

623
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,315
"I know you didn't do it, because I did."

624
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,519
Then he starts laughing.

625
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,877
And he says, "You must be
the sorriest fuck in this unit."

626
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,313
I can hear him every night.

627
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,230
Bobby Earl!

628
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,913
Why won't you talk to me?

629
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,835
Shut up, you crazy fuck!

630
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,553
Shut up!

631
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,800
It's like a death sentence
on top of a death sentence.

632
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,313
He calls me his Iast victim.

633
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,749
Who is he?

634
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,239
BIair Sullivan.

635
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,872
You really had me going.

636
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,713
I was starting to think:

637
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,711
"Maybe the man is onto something."

638
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,549
What do you mean?

639
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,189
Funny thing is, you almost pulled it off,
you almost got away with it.

640
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,915
Got away with what?

641
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,909
Your wife, Slick.

642
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,030
"Prentiss" is her maiden name, isn't it?

643
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,029
Yes. Was.

644
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,233
Was before she married you.

645
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,510
Laurie Prentiss, Assistant DA.

646
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,195
What about her?

647
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,314
She was the prosecutor on Robert Earl's
kidnap trial in Dade. Ring any bells?

648
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,952
What you think?

649
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,994
Small-town police
don't do their homework?

650
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,911
Don't know how to access information?

651
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,272
I don't understand exactly what kind of
hidden agenda you got up your sleeve...

652
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,078
...but I'm telling you...

653
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,839
...stay out of my town.

654
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,235
I'd been plea bargaining everything
that came across my desk.

655
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,477
I just wanted to show
the good old boys how good I was.

656
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,711
I was hot for it.
Thought I had the case locked tight.

657
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,360
My star witness, the arresting officer.

658
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,909
He said when he came up on the car,
that Bobby Earl was on top of her...

659
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,673
...in the back seat and she was screaming.

660
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,035
Two seconds into the cross-examination...

661
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,078
...the defense attorney produces
a prom photo...

662
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,113
...with my star witness in a tuxedo
with the victim.

663
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,839
Son of a bitch admits
they were high school sweethearts!

664
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,911
I didn't want to give up, so...

665
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,592
...I got the judge to grant me
a 24-hour recess so I could regroup.

666
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,672
I came back with nothing
and he threw the case out.

667
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,832
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

668
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,316
I did. I told you when I met you.

669
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,276
Bullshit.

670
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:50,591
Should've told me
when you read the letter.

671
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,272
-I didn't--
-Why not?

672
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,239
I didn't know if it would influence you.

673
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,874
That you might not take the case,
you might not help this kid.

674
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,149
He paid dearly for what happened to him.

675
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,835
Why? Because he lost a scholarship
and spent an extra night in prison?

676
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,315
No, Paul.

677
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,153
It was more than that.

678
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,756
Later, I found out that they beat him
real bad that night.

679
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,951
He ended up in the hospital.

680
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,756
Listen.

681
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,309
It was my fault.

682
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,558
I want you to help him get his life back.

683
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,200
I want you to make it right for him.

684
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,397
No, Laurie, you want me
to make it right for you.

685
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,268
You're right.

686
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,553
But how does what I'm telling you
change his situation on Death Row?

687
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,275
Okay.

688
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,155
It was called "The Pilgrimage of Death. "
It sold many papers.

689
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,198
The guy started with his landlady
in New Orleans...

690
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,437
...a prostitute in Mobile
and a sailor in Pensacola.

691
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,437
Then he got real busy.

692
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,915
A body every 100 miles.

693
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,434
When was Pensacola?

694
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,479
Late April, early May.

695
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,835
It was incredible.

696
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:26,590
APBs in three states,
FBI flyers all over the place...

697
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,511
...and no one spots him.

698
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,793
Painting, writing letters
to the families of his victims...

699
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,393
...that's all he does.

700
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:40,272
Yeah, we got a whole other theme park
for Mr. Sullivan.

701
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,271
I'm innocent! I'm innocent!

702
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,794
All right...

703
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,919
...he's all yours.

704
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,311
They don't like me very much.

705
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,875
Really?

706
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,439
Why is that?

707
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,709
Creative differences.

708
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,599
Tape recorder. May I?

709
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,515
Be my guest.

710
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,716
You have quite an art gallery back there.

711
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,150
Thank you.

712
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,357
Idle hands are the devil's workshop.

713
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,354
You believe in Jesus?

714
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,918
Yes, I do.

715
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,395
That's good.

716
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,434
That's very good.

717
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,748
I killed so many goddamn people...

718
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,913
...I can't keep up with my correspondence,
but my question is:

719
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,753
Do you think any of those people
got out of bed on their last day...

720
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,195
...thinking, "Today's my day to die"?

721
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,429
You got to take Jesus into your heart now,
because you never know.

722
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,550
Even if you don't have a condition,
you might have a situation.

723
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,435
You a killer too?

724
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,755
Me?

725
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,517
No.

726
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,308
You never went to war?

727
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,233
Korea? Vietnam?

728
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,475
Never did a hit-and-run with the BMW?

729
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,430
Never told the wifey to get an abortion?

730
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:37,599
Or that piece of chicken on the side,
"Here's $300, take care of it."

731
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,153
Because you got that look.

732
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,309
You got ice in your eyes.

733
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,075
I can tell.

734
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,275
You're wrong.

735
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,555
Am I now?

736
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,753
Mr. Armstrong...

737
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,031
...Iet's see whom we're talking to.

738
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,709
Are you married?

739
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,910
Yes.

740
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,510
Kids?

741
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,230
No.

742
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,829
Liar.

743
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,273
House or apartment?

744
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,955
A house.

745
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,952
Alarms on the windows?

746
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:17,677
Dogs?

747
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,508
Have trouble sleeping?

748
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,952
-No.
-Liar.

749
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:24,873
You afraid to die?

750
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,714
Don't think about it.

751
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,437
Liar!

752
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,473
That's three lies.

753
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,753
Same as Peter did to Jesus
before the cock crowed.

754
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,918
You should be ashamed of yourself,
lying to a condemned man.

755
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,515
Don't my...

756
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,752
...ies tell you as much about me
as my truths?

757
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,715
Okay.

758
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,039
Would you do me a favor?
Mail this for me.

759
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,029
Thank you.

760
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,828
What do you want to talk to me for?

761
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,875
Ochopee.

762
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,629
Nice town.

763
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,633
What happened there?

764
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,675
You been talking to my old neighbor,
Bobby Earl. Excitable boy.

765
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,153
Did you kill Joanie Shriver?

766
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,675
Did I?

767
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,354
There been so many.

768
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,355
Did you kill Joanie Shriver?

769
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,069
You're starting to get all frantic
and excited, just like Bobby Earl did.

770
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:37,956
Did you?

771
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,113
You're my first visitor in two years since
those behavioral science boys visited me.

772
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,077
Wanted to know about my childhood.

773
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,708
Did my folks beat me,
abuse me, sex me up?

774
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,993
I told them there ain't no formula
for people like me.

775
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,999
What we're dealing with here
is just a predisposition for an appetite.

776
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,272
You know, good parents, bad parents....

777
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,673
Ain't no cause and effect.
It's just an appetite.

778
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,116
Fuck you.

779
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,998
Let me tell you a few things, Armstrong.
One:

780
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,991
I am filled with power!

781
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,988
You may think I'm an impotent prisoner...

782
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,789
...Iocked in a cell each night and day,
but I am filled with a strength...

783
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,190
...that reaches beyond these bars!

784
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,432
I can touch anyone I want to!

785
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,160
Just as easy as dialing the telephone!

786
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,630
There's no one beyond my reach!
You hear me? No one!

787
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,109
Did you kill her?

788
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,873
I ain't going to tell you if I did or not.

789
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,829
Even if I did, how would you know
to believe me?

790
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,078
Killing is easy for me.
How hard do you think lying is?

791
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,839
Yeah. Go to hell.

792
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,555
I will.

793
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,119
No doubt about that.

794
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,075
What if I could help you find something?

795
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,639
Something important.

796
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,639
Something interesting.

797
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,119
Real important.

798
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:56,715
Like what?

799
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,510
Where is it?

800
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,068
-Not far from where they found her.
-Where?

801
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,833
They didn't read the signs.

802
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,756
What signs?

803
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,636
The Bible.

804
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,115
The Bible?

805
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,914
Ecclesiastes 11:1.

806
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,633
You can't miss it if you can read the signs.

807
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,716
What signs?

808
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,155
"Seek, and ye shall find."

809
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,231
-Do you have a Bible here?
-We have plenty. The Gideons love us.

810
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,757
-How'd it go?
-I wouldn't like him as a neighbor.

811
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,157
-He asked me to mail this.
-Not again. Goddamn him.

812
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,274
Wilkinsons.

813
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,555
Sick bastard.

814
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,757
I never send these letters.
Can't even read them anymore.

815
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,188
Hey, Roz, what's up, baby?

816
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,351
You saw Tyrone?

817
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,911
He is not telling you the truth.
You know he's lying.

818
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,230
I saw him with her last night.

819
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,593
Someone is here so I'll speak to you later.
All right, then.

820
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,594
Hi.

821
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,114
Is Tanny Brown here?

822
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,350
He's at a soccer practice with my brother.

823
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,634
Hi. I'm Lena.

824
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,398
-You must be Mr. Armstrong.
-Yeah? How do you know?

825
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:43,553
Everyone knows you're the guy
my father was complaining about.

826
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,398
He'i be back in a few minutes.

827
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,152
Would you care for some iced tea?

828
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,674
-That would be very nice.
-Come in.

829
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,631
I'm going to study law too.

830
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,759
I graduated first in my high school class.

831
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,519
Good for you.

832
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,797
I'm thinking about going
to the University of Virginia.

833
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,157
They have a great school
and my mom lives in Newport News.

834
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,593
That's Joanie and me.

835
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,910
Daddy used to call us his girls.

836
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,910
I remember how we used to talk
about opening up a pet shop together.

837
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,835
I miss her.

838
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,998
A day doesn't go by
that I still don't talk to her.

839
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,075
To who?
