00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,360
Which means I make coffee for a living.

176
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,778
[laughs]

177
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,363
But right now I'm looking at you,

178
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,989
and I'm seeing some
yellowing in your eyes.

179
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,242
Which means what, Milla? Hmm?

180
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:01,411
Oh, um, it could be liver problems.

181
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,623
Jaundice, hepatitis, Gilbert syndrome.

182
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,334
You should probably
see a doctor, actually.

183
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,382
All right, well...

184
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,801
you kids be safe.

185
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,513
Maybe we'll see you again.

186
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,312
- [sighs]
- Seriously, do not do that ever again.

187
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,356
- I can't handle that.
- Dude, why do we let you drink?

188
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,691
Because usually I'm very funny.

189
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,193
No, actually, you have never,
ever been funny.

190
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:34,486
Like, never.

191
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,946
Where are the drinks?

192
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,282
[rock song playing]

193
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,742
[Milla]
You know this song.

194
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,619
[Adam]
Do you know this?

195
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,663
No, but it's a good song.

196
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,889
Okay, people, 8:00 a.m.

197
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,016
Luis, Gary, I'm talking to you.

198
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,767
Okay, I'm not a morning person.

199
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,853
If I don't get my eight hours,
I will be a zombie.

200
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,771
- [Milla] Be a zombie who hikes.
- [Darius] Hey, guys.

201
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,024
- Guys.
- [Milla] What?

202
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,610
[Darius] Who's that by the car?

203
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,820
Is that one of those assholes
from the bar?

204
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,780
[Darius]
Yeah, probably.

205
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,824
- Hey.
- [Darius] Adam.

206
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,868
- Relax.
- [Adam] Hey!

207
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,953
Get away from the car, man.

208
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,123
Get away from there. Shoo.

209
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,125
- He's not a dog.
- Yo!

210
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,462
Are you deaf or something?
Back the fuck off!

211
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:38,175
Jesus, Adam, are you trying
to piss off everyone in Middle America?

212
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,927
You gotta be tough with these people.

213
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,428
[Milla]
Okay, big guy, time for bed.

214
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:42,763
- Come on.
- Back me up here.

215
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,473
Adam.

216
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,058
[whispering]
Come on, forget about it.

217
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,768
[Adam]
Where the hell did that guy go?

218
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,519
- [phone line ringing]
- [Milla] Come on.

219
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,229
[Scott, on voicemail]
<i>Hi. This is Scott.</i>

220
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,231
<i>Leave a message and I'll get
right back to you. Thank you.</i>

221
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:56,193
- [voicemail beeps]
- [Jen] <i>Hey, Dad. Sorry to call so late.</i>

222
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,195
We're still hiking the Appalachian Trail.

223
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,197
When I get back,
I promise I'll give you an answer

224
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,865
about what I plan to do.

225
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,203
I love you.

226
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,579
Say hi to Corinne.

227
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,498
Maybe she'll say hi back for a change.

228
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,376
Okay, talk soon.

229
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,170
Bye.

230
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,173
[Milla]
<i>So is Adam right?</i>

231
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,716
<i>Are you on edge?</i>

232
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,052
We can go home right now.

233
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,722
Hey, nice try,
but you don't have to protect me.

234
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,107
You know why I work in nonprofit
instead of on Wall Street?

235
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,820
Because...

236
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,908
I want to build a community
where people are valued

237
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:48,745
on their skills and their character.

238
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:55,877
Not their bank account
or their skin color.

239
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,047
Everyone works.

240
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,300
Everyone shares.

241
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:07,097
I'd give anything for that.

242
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,599
I know.

243
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,021
That's why I love you.

244
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,695
These are beautiful.
Did you make all this?

245
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,031
Some.

246
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,493
Hey.

247
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,162
I'm Jen. What's your name?

248
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,875
- [laughs]
- Don't mind Ruthie.

249
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,293
She don't like to talk.

250
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,212
I was shy too at her age.

251
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,131
- Is she yours?
- In a manner.

252
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:26,134
It takes a village to raise a child,
isn't that what they say?

253
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:27,969
How much?

254
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,346
Ten dollars.

255
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,181
[zipper opens]

256
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,354
[Jen laughs]

257
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,980
Thanks.

258
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,110
[Milla] Good morning.

259
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,028
I've literally never seen you wear this.

260
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,988
- Wow. Wow.
- Okay.

261
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,448
[indistinct chattering]

262
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,325
[all]
Yeah!

263
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:51,576
[applause]

264
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,829
[Adam]
Walk of shame.

265
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,048
[Milla] Hey, what's up, you guys?
Me and Gary are going on a hike.

266
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,925
[Gary]
I didn't know that you were filming.

267
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,344
[Milla] Everyone's here.
Yeah, it's for a YouTube video.

268
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,276
[Milla]
Catch me.

269
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:26,903
[all laughing]

270
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,072
Oh, my God! Help!

271
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,574
[indistinct chatter]

272
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,035
[Milla]
Oh, it's beautiful. Nature.

273
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,121
[Adam]
Is anyone still drunk from last night?

274
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,123
- [all laughing]
- [Gary] Bitch, I am.

275
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,708
That last shot was a bad idea.

276
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,335
[Jen] Wait, looks like the trail ends.

277
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,172
[Milla] Are we going this way,
or are we going this way?

278
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,132
[Luis]
Do you have signal on your phone?

279
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,717
[Milla]
No.

280
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,594
[all laughing]

281
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,888
- [Jen] I can do that.
- [Darius] I've been horrible.

282
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,308
- [Adam] Look at that.
- This is fucking awesome!

283
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,976
[all laughing]

284
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,811
Whoo!

285
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,029
It's up here.

286
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,160
Okay?

287
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,014
[no audio]

288
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,194
[Milla] Do you know where we're going?

289
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,153
[Adam] I don't.

290
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,821
[Milla] Do you know where we're going?

291
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,448
[indistinct chattering]

292
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,536
Okay, quick little side trip, guys.

293
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,163
- [Jen] What?
- There's supposed to be

294
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:02,749
a very well-preserved
Civil War fort near here.

295
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,960
Cool. Let's find it.

296
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:07,587
Um, the woman at the inn
said we shouldn't leave the trail.

297
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,547
It's just a quick look around.

298
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:13,051
Babe, if we don't find anything,
we'll just cut back over to the trail.

299
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:16,638
You know what we wouldn't have found
if we would have stayed on the trail?

300
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,932
Hmm? The waterfall.

301
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,476
And that cliff, hmm?

302
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,062
[laughs]
Come on. We'll be good.

303
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,358
- Okay.
- Okay?

304
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,027
- [laughs]
- She said yes!

305
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,363
- [Jen] Whoo! Whoo!
- [Gary] Let's do it.

306
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,739
[Adam] What does that mean?
They getting married?

307
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,241
[Milla] Wait, just for the hike, right?

308
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,040
[Jen] You good?

309
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,419
[Gary] Such a hiker.

310
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,342
[Milla] What was that?

311
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,136
- [Adam] A snake.
- [Milla] Oh, my God.

312
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,180
[Milla gasps]

313
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,601
- [Adam] You okay?
- Yeah.

314
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,563
[Gary] We're good.

315
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,898
- [Jen] Shit. Yeah, thanks.
- Fuck.

316
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,198
[camera clicks]

317
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,578
- Ah!
- [all scream]

318
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,542
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

319
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,545
Dar, how much longer
is this gonna take?

320
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,506
Look, it's just a little further, okay?
I promise, okay?

321
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,674
Please.

322
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,301
- You okay?
- No!

323
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,264
[Darius] We got to go.
We got to keep going.

324
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,683
[Adam] We've been walking
for fucking hours.

325
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:44,642
That's what we've been doing.

326
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,478
[Milla] We've been walking
way more than an hour.

327
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,646
What are you talking about?
It's been like four hours.

328
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,231
- [Gary] Four hours?
- [Adam] No, I mean...

329
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:52,025
I mean, since we passed that thing.

330
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,651
You know what?

331
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:57,530
Why don't you guys
just, um, just head back to the trail.

332
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,990
I'll meet you guys up there.

333
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:01,242
[wood cracking distantly]

334
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,244
What is that?

335
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,045
- [gasps]
- Oh, my God! Adam!

336
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,755
- Oh, my God!
- Go, go, go, go, go.

337
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:15,715
[log rumbling]

338
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,302
[Darius] You guys, move left!

345
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,381
Adam?

346
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,051
Milla. Hey.

347
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,846
[grunts]

348
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,306
You left me.

349
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,310
- What?
- You left me.

350
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,062
I know. I know. I'm sorry, okay?

351
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:13,106
I was freaking out.
I didn't know what I was doing.

352
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,774
- You left me!
- I know. I'm sorry.

353
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:16,901
[sobbing]
You left me!

354
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,736
Please, don't do that again!

355
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,738
- [panting]
- [Adam] I'm so sorry, okay?

356
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,490
Come here.

357
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,742
Oh, fuck.

358
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,453
Jen? Jen?

359
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,039
Jen! Jen!

360
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:31,833
Are you okay?

361
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,878
[panting]

362
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,254
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

363
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:37,881
Oh, my God, Darius! Your finger!

364
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,382
Oh, fuck!

365
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,633
[hyperventilating]

366
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,094
We're okay. Oh, fuck.

367
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,597
Where's Luis and Gary?

368
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,015
Huh?

369
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,942
[shrieks]

370
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:00,111
[Adam] Oh, shit.

371
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,827
Luis. Luis, man. Get out of here.

372
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,245
Come on. Let's go over here. Come on.

373
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:10,622
No, no, no, no.

374
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,540
- No, no! No!
- Let's go over here.

375
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,751
Do not fucking touch me!

376
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,213
Okay.

377
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,256
[sobbing]

378
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,841
No, no, no.

379
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,303
Oh, fucking shit.

380
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,971
[crying]

381
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,890
We need to call for help.

382
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:30,850
I can't... I can't find my phone.

383
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:33,019
I can't find my phone. Help me find it.

384
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,772
Oh, fuck. No service.

385
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,649
We need to go to higher ground.

386
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,609
I'm going to climb up
and try and make a call.

387
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,070
There's no way we're going to go
back up there, okay?

388
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,989
- I'll find a way around.
- What fucking way around?

389
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:48,117
- Not by yourself.
- Jen... this is my fault.

390
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,453
It goddamn is.
It is your goddamn fault!

391
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,996
[all shouting]

392
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,915
[Adam]
Luis! Hey! Hey!

393
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,167
It's nobody's fault, okay?
Did Darius make the tree fall?

394
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:58,419
Look at me.
Did Darius make the tree fall? No.

395
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:02,382
This is fucking awful, okay?
But it's nobody's fault, okay?

396
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:03,925
[Luis sobbing]

397
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:08,221
Luis, I'm sorry, man!
I'm fucking sorry, man!

398
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,182
I'll go by myself. I'll go right now.

399
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,809
We all have to go.

400
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:15,019
- [Darius] Why?
- [sobs] I can't leave him.

401
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,729
[thunder rumbles]

402
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:21,192
If it rains,
which it looks like it's about to...

403
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:25,029
we're exposed out here, guys.

404
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,783
This slope's not safe.

405
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,831
I think... I think someone's up there.

406
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,292
- [Darius] What?
- [Jen] Someone's up there.

407
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,297
- [Darius] I don't... I don't see anyone.
- [Jen] Where are they?

408
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:49,554
I saw someone. I did.
I-I saw someone.

409
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:50,972
This is so fucked up.

410
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,473
[Jen] I saw someone.

411
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,058
It's okay.

412
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:58,438
Fuck this. Fuck this!

413
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,782
- [bone cracks]
- [whimpers]

414
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,868
You okay?

415
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,624
[clears throat]

416
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,167
Thanks.

417
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,377
No problem.

418
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,766
He won't be here long.

419
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,138
[Luis] No one's gonna admit it.

420
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,225
So I will.

421
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,644
We're lost!

422
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,063
Just admit it, Darius.

423
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:26,526
- No fucking clue where we are.
- Hey. Hey. We're fine.

424
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:28,361
We're-we're cutting across the mountain,

425
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,947
and eventually,
we'll hit the AT on the other side.

426
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,491
But I think that we can probably
camp out for the night.

427
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,285
I'm not leaving Gary
out there in the woods overnight

428
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,497
for animals and insects
and whatever the fuck!

429
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,332
That's not Gary anymore.

430
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,210
Luis, that was his body.

431
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,337
His spirit's moved on.

432
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,298
That's what he believed, right?

433
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:53,136
He's in paradise now. He's happy.

434
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,642
- Come here, man.
- [Luis sobs]

435
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:09,944
Okay?

436
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,530
Okay.

437
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,449
[thunder rumbles]

438
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:25,126
Can you pull this?

439
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,559
[rain pattering]

440
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:01,954
[thunder crashes]

441
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,062
[birds tweeting]

442
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,693
Oh, fuck.

443
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,657
Thank God it stopped raining.

444
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,784
Where's Milla?

445
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,743
Hmm?

446
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,163
I-1 didn't feel her get up.

447
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,166
She probably went somewhere to pee.

448
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:48,501
Milla?

449
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,794
[thump]

450
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:57,844
Jesus.

451
00:28:01,264 --> 00:28:02,849
We've been sleeping in a graveyard.

452
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,184
[Darius] Hey, guys, come check this out.

453
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,562
What?

454
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,021
Look at this.

455
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:12,900
This is a declaration pledge
to the foundation of America.

456
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:16,195
[scoffs] You mean the Confederacy.

457
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,155
Long live slavery.

458
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:23,703
Uh, no, actually, this is...
dated before the war.

459
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:26,163
"November 24, 1859."

460
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,749
There's like a dozen families listed here,

461
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,295
pledging their lives
and their-their children's lives.

462
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:35,256
Hey, did one of you take my phone?

463
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,884
Um... no.

464
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:40,386
Maybe you dropped it yesterday
when everything was happening.

465
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:44,390
[Luis] No, no, I-I put it back
in my pack last night.

466
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,313
[Jen] Mine's not here either.

467
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:55,109
- Did Milla come back?
- [Luis] No.

468
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:57,153
- Hey, do you have your phone?
- What?

469
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,155
[patting pants]

470
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,411
Shit.

471
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,413
Where's our fucking phones?

472
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,040
[Luis] Okay, all our phones are gone.

473
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,917
What the fuck is going on?

474
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,544
I thought I saw somebody
outside the tent last night.

475
00:29:13,628 --> 00:29:15,087
- [Darius] What?
- What?

476
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,173
- When?
- [Jen] In the middle of the night.

477
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,841
Just for a second.

478
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:20,635
Could have just been
shadows from the trees.

479
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,553
Fuck!

480
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,555
You guys, help me... Help me find Milla.

481
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,599
- Adam...
- [Jen] I'm sure she's fine.

482
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,143
You thought you saw someone
after the tree fell,

483
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:32,313
and then again last night,
and now our fucking phones are gone.

484
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:35,024
They're probably fucking
watching us right now!

485
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,486
No, no, no, no, I promised her
that I wouldn't fucking leave her again.

486
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:39,946
I fucking promised her that.

487
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,447
Hey, Adam! Adam!

488
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,366
[Adam] Milla!

489
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:47,078
Milla!

490
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,330
- [Jen] Milla!
- [Darius] Milla!

491
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,957
Milla!

492
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,709
Milla?

493
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:55,920
- [Luis] Milla!
- [Adam] Milla!

494
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,756
Milla!

495
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,258
Milla!

496
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:02,510
Hey.

497
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,553
[Luis] Milla!

498
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,516
- What are you doing out here?
- [Adam] Milla!

499
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:11,811
Who's that?

500
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,647
I saw her in town.

501
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,357
I think her name's Ruthie.

502
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,150
In town?

503
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,443
Hey!

504
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:21,654
Hey. Sorry.

505
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,572
Come here.
Why don't you come here for a second.

506
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:25,074
- Adam.
- [Adam] I just wanna ask you something.

507
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,869
No, you see this girl, and now she's here
out of fucking nowhere, and Milla's gone?

508
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,329
You think that this is a coincidence?

509
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,164
- No fucking way.
- Calm down.

510
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,250
I fucking warned you
about these white-trash hillbillies.

511
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,002
- Hey!
- Adam! Stop!

512
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:37,378
[Adam] Get over here!

513
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,046
Hey! Hey!

514
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:40,923
- [Jen] Adam!
- Hey!

515
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,758
Stop. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

516
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,095
[grunts]

517
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,221
[Jen]
Adam.

518
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:51,559
[Adam groaning]

519
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,185
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't let her get away!

520
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:55,521
- Dar, go on after her!
- [Jen] No, wait!

521
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,815
What?

522
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:00,109
Guys? Guys, what is that?

523
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,486
My foot's caught on something.

524
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,738
What the hell is that?

525
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,865
Guys! Whoa!

526
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,366
What the hell is this?

527
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,036
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Darius!

528
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,830
- What's going on? Guys?
- [Jen] Darius, help!

529
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:14,081
What? What?

530
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:16,417
[Adam screaming]

531
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,838
[Jen] Adam! Oh, my God!

532
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,423
[screaming]

533
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,300
No, no, no, no, no, no!

534
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,676
[Darius] Adam?

535
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,261
Can you hear me?

536
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,180
- Adam!
- Do you see him?

537
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:30,890
[breathing heavily] No.

538
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,100
Uh, I-I feel a draft.

539
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,643
Luis, grab my legs.

540
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,145
Lower me in, okay?

541
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,897
[grunts]
[pants]

542
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,398
Adam!

543
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,067
Adam...

544
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,779
Adam.

545
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,032
Oh, fuck! Shit! Shit!

546
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,533
[hissing]

547
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:52,203
Darius, this is crazy. We need help.

548
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,871
Look, if I can get that snake
out of there,

549
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,581
- maybe I can reach Adam, okay.
- [Jen] And do what?

550
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,709
He's still caught on that chain.
What if he's hurt?

551
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:01,420
Maybe this hole connects
to an old mine or something.

552
00:32:01,504 --> 00:32:02,963
We can look for an entrance, and then...

553
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,425
Okay, how long do you want to look?
An hour? Two? All day?

554
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,760
That chain goes somewhere!

555
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,638
I know! Somebody put it there.

556
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,389
Do you hear what I'm saying?

557
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:15,518
We need to get the fuck
off this mountain and get help.

558
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,603
No phones. No GPS.

559
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,523
How are we supposed to find
our way back here, huh?

560
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,691
Jen, what the hell are you doing?

561
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,572
Let's go.

562
00:32:58,018 --> 00:32:59,770
What is this place?

563
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:03,315
[Darius] Looks like a lost and found
for the whole mountain.

564
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,537
I think maybe Adam
was right about these people.

565
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,122
We should go.

566
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,207
[footsteps]

567
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,670
[whispering] Guys, guys, shh.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

568
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:31,927
[Jen] Is that them?

569
00:33:32,011 --> 00:33:34,430
- Those hunters from town?
- I don't know.

570
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:35,973
I-I can't...

571
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,226
That's Adam.

572
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,729
That's Adam.

573
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:45,149
[blade unsheathes]

574
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,942
[Jen] Darius, no.

575
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,867
Hey, hey. Put him down right now.

576
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,411
Put him the fuck down!

577
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,000
[speaks in foreign language]

578
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,627
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't understand.

579
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,129
[speaking foreign language]

580
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,839
Speak English.

581
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,093
- Oh, my God, Adam.
- Is he dead?

582
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:14,720
[Darius] Hey, where's our friend?

583
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,388
Where's our friend?
Did you take her? Did you?

584
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,474
Did you kill her? Answer me!

585
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,185
- Where is she? What'd you do?
- Did you fucking take her? Hey!

586
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:22,728
I will fucking kill you! Back up!

587
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,147
Get the fuck back!

588
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,483
[Jen] Where is she?
What did you do with her?

589
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,026
Where is she? Where the fuck is she?

590
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,487
- [speaking foreign language]
- I can't fucking understand you.

591
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,072
Speak English! Speak English!

592
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,574
[overlapped shouting]

593
00:34:35,658 --> 00:34:37,284
[yells]

594
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:55,302
You killed her! You killed her!
You killed her!

595
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:57,471
[grunts]
[yells]

596
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,431
- Adam! Adam!
- You killed her!

597
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,475
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [Darius] Adam, Adam.

598
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,019
[wails]

599
00:35:06,397 --> 00:35:08,274
Adam, Adam, Adam. Shit.

600
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:11,318
- [Adam whimpers]
- [Darius] Shit.

601
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:13,696
- [Adam] Where's the other one?
- [Darius] Oh, shit.

602
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:20,536
He's gone.

603
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:22,871
Oh, my God.

604
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,666
I had to.

605
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:26,917
They...

606
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:29,295
They killed Milla. They...

607
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,088
They killed her.

608
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,799
Adam.

609
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,051
- Adam.
- Oh, my God.

610
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:37,886
[Milla] What happened to you guys?

611
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,097
What the hell's going on here?
What's going...?

612
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,891
What is that?
What the fuck is going on?

613
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:44,351
Fuck.

614
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,564
What the fuck is that, guys?

615
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:50,357
What happened?

616
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:52,776
You're alive.

617
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,403
Yes. I'm alive. What is this?

618
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,946
Where have you been?

619
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,240
I left to go pee. I was in the woods.

620
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:01,243
I saw these two huge guys.
They were... they were dressed like this.

621
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:02,828
So I hid in the bush.

622
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,456
We went looking for you.
Didn't you hear us calling?

623
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,541
[Milla] Yeah, but I couldn't answer back,
or else they'd hear me.

624
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:10,085
By the time they left, you had all gone.

625
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,463
- Babe, what happened to you?
- I thought you were dead.

626
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:14,131
Milla, we thought that they'd taken you,

627
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,551
or-or-or killed you or something.

628
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,429
Did you just kill this man for no reason?

629
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,473
No-no reason?

630
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,850
They dragged me into a fucking hole,

631
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,935
trussed me up
like a goddamn Christmas turkey.

632
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,063
Who knows what they were
going to do to me?

633
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,732
All we know for sure
is that you just killed someone.

634
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:35,444
They were going to kill me, okay?

635
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,821
Look at him. He's a...
He's a fucking animal.

636
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,656
He's right. Listen, listen.

637
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,992
There's one fucking dead guy
on the ground, the other one left.

638
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:43,452
We don't know how many more there are.

639
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,246
We have to get the fuck
off of this mountain, right?

640
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,664
What about the body?

641
00:36:47,748 --> 00:36:49,750
Yeah, what about it?
I mean, we left Gary.

642
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:53,003
Yeah. When we get back to town,
we'll let the fucking police

643
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,422
- handle this shit.
- No, fuck that.

644
00:36:55,798 --> 00:37:00,010
No way. I-I-I am not turning myself over
to some redneck judge.

645
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:02,054
No, fuck that.
We-we-we were never here.

646
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,098
We were never here.

647
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,683
So we just walk away from this?

648
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,435
Yes.

649
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,687
What about the other one? He saw us.

650
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,065
Oh, the other one.
The really friendly-looking one

651
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,734
with the skull mask
that was... that was speaking tongues?

652
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:17,986
Yeah, I'm sure he's a regular
at city council meetings.

653
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,364
- Dude, listen. Hey, hey, listen.
- [Adam] They were gonna kill me!

654
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,990
Listen, okay, I get it.
They didn't kill Milla.

655
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:25,786
But the-the-the snare trap
and the lumber mill, right?

656
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,414
- And Adam tied to a fucking log?
- Yes, yes.

657
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:30,916
I mean, who fucking knows?
They probably killed Gary.

658
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,961
Like, these are clearly not good people.

659
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:38,090
We got to get the fuck out of here, guys.

660
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,926
Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on.

661
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,553
[Milla] Come on.

662
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,225
[Adam] <i>We're still headed east.</i>

663
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,811
Once we find a stream,
we can follow it down the mountain.

664
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,521
Why don't we just go straight down?

665
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,398
You want to take a header off a cliff?
Be my guest.

666
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,525
Okay, you don't have to be
a fucking bitch about it. I get it.

667
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,402
It's my fault. I should've
announced I was leaving to go pee.

668
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,571
- [Adam] It's okay. Forget it.
- [Darius] Fuck.

669
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:02,656
We should've grabbed some
of that climbing gear we saw.

670
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:05,242
No, it's good we didn't touch
anything, right? No traces?

671
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,202
If we've done nothing wrong,
we have nothing to hide.

672
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:11,206
Jesus, fucking quit it
with the morality police bullshit, Jen.

673
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,666
You're clueless about what you want

674
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,043
for your own blessed
all-American white girl life,

675
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,171
and yet you know exactly
what's right for everybody else?

676
00:38:17,254 --> 00:38:18,755
- That's not what I'm saying.
- Really?

677
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,549
Do we honestly not know
what's right and wrong here?

678
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,677
What's right for you
has nothing to do with anyone else.

679
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,262
What's right should be right, period.

680
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,305
- [Adam] Look...
- It's not for you to say.

681
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,265
The guy's dead. It's over.

682
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,642
We're not talking about it
to anybody, all right?

683
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:31,768
Whatever.

684
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:34,104
[Darius] Hey, how about we all
just shut up and relax?

685
00:38:34,188 --> 00:38:35,647
Let's see if we can make that happen.

686
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:37,316
Fuck.

687
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:39,067
Jesus Christ.

688
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:49,870
[Jen] Oh, my God! Darius!

689
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,790
Are you okay? Are you okay?

690
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:55,709
Another fucking trap.

691
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,046
Still think these people aren't monsters?

692
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:03,842
[Milla] Ooh, okay. It's not that bad.

693
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,260
You're lucky you didn't tear an artery.

694
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,970
[Jen] Where'd it come from?

695
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,515
Must've stepped on something
to trigger it.

696
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:11,225
Fuck this place.

697

00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,652
Luis?

704
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:07,322

[Darius] Dude, there's nobody there.

Guys, it's them.

714
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,392
- There's nobody there, man. Relax. Relax.
- Guys?

715
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:38,437

Good morning.

768
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,752
You're late. And you're carpool today.

769
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:31,837
- I know.
- I have class.

770
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,755
I got a meeting in Saddle River
with a roofer

771
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,006
and a concrete guy in Millburn.

772
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:36,633
- Hey.
- Hey.

773
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,718
- You haven't heard from Jen, have you?
- Why would she call me?

774
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:40,595
- Because you're her mom.
- Don't say "mom."

775
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,558
She hates that. Get your stuff.
You have one minute.

776
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,184
Jenny, it's your dad.

777
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:50,188
I'm, uh, just calling again
to see how you're doing.

778
00:44:50,272 --> 00:44:53,066
I hope you're having fun
with your friends.

779
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,902
<i>Listen, I'd love to talk to you
about that offer.</i>

780
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:57,654
<i>You'd get your own office
and your own coffee maker</i>

<i>Excuse the pun. [chuckles]</i>

783
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,492
<i>Anyhow...</i>

784
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,579
don't forget to call me, all right?

785
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:07,998
It's been a couple weeks now, and...

786
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:10,375
I'd love to hear your voice.

787
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,168
Please, give me a call.

788
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:15,547
Thank you. I love you. Bye.

789
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:19,759
Weird.

790
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:21,052
It went to voicemail again.

[door closes]

792
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:24,514
Want to know why she doesn't call?

793
00:45:24,598 --> 00:45:26,224
Jennifer went off to find herself,

794
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:29,060
which is a choice she made
to avoid making a choice.

795
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:33,607
Look, how about you focus
on my boys, our boys?

796
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,233
- [laughs]
- For once.

797
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:36,985

Help me!

804
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,299
Stop your screaming,
or you'll suffer for it.

00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:43,093
You. I know you.

806
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:45,011
Help me. Please help me.

807
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:46,888
Do you want food? Water?

808
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:48,598
- Yes.
- Then shut your mouth.

809
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:49,975
Understand?

810
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:51,518
Please, please, please, let me go.

811
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:53,687
Please. You met me in town, remember?

812
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,190
- You and the little girl? Ruthie?
- You don't want to listen.

813
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,943
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
I'm sorry!

814
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,486
I'm sorry. Please.

815
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,446

Oh, God.

This is court.

839
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:28,628
You are on trial.

840
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:31,673
Trial? For what?

00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:37,692
"When these others attacked us."

879
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:39,902

881
00:54:45,992 --> 00:54:49,579
"He killed my brother Samuel."

882
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:51,664
No. We didn't know.

883
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,375
They were wearing skulls,

884
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:57,044
and their bodies were covered
with leaves and blood.

885
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:01,257
What we wear when we go hunting, huh?

886
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,052
To hide our scent and our faces
from our prey.

887
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:06,846
Your hunters do the same.

888
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,723
Hmm?

889
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:12,059
Did he do what Morgan has accused?

890
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:17,064
Did this man murder
Morgan's brother, Samuel?

891
00:55:18,649 --> 00:55:23,529
Lie, and dread will fall on each of you.

892
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:26,657
[Edith] I warn you.

893
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:29,243
Speak true.

894
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:37,960
No.

895
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:42,632
He didn't murder him.

896
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:58,022
[gags]

897
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,610
Ruthie.

898
00:56:09,784 --> 00:56:13,287
Ruthie, who killed Samuel?

899

[whimpers]

900
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,503
You lied to this court.

901
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:23,172
No, no.

902
00:56:23,256 --> 00:56:24,757
Adam feared for his life.

903
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,176
He killed this man in self-defense.

904
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,553
It's not murder.

905
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:30,721
We thought they were kidnapping him.

906
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:32,974
We thought they were taking him
somewhere to kill him.

907
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:35,434
Why? Why did you think this?

908
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:38,312
What proof did you have?

909
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:41,190
Had you met any of our people?

910
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:45,152
Had we caused you any harm?!

911
00:56:57,957 --> 00:57:01,460
This court finds you guilty of murder.

912
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:04,797
- The sentence is death.
- [Adam] What?

913
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,508
No, no, no, I didn't...
It was a mistake.

914
00:57:07,592 --> 00:57:09,343
I didn't know what they were doing.

915
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:11,596
It's not my fault!

916
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,014
[grunts]

917
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,142
Get back.

918
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:18,144
You want this kid to join your brother?

919
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:20,354
Then back the fuck off!

920
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:21,856
Adam, Adam, no.

921
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:24,483
- Shut up.
- [Darius] Hey, hey, Adam.

922
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:27,737
If you hurt her, you make things
worse for all of us.

923
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:31,991
Look around, Dar.
This shit's already worse.

924
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:34,160
Okay, this is what you're gonna do.

925
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:40,082
You're going to untie my friends,
and then you're going to let us go.

926
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:43,044
I'm not afraid of you!

927
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:46,255
I just want to get as far away
from you backwoods fucks

928
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:47,548
as I possibly can.

929
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:49,675
Now, move.

930
00:57:49,759 --> 00:57:51,844
I look in your eyes.

931
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:55,348
I see only fear.

932
00:57:56,641 --> 00:57:58,684
There's no future for men like you.

933
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:01,646
Fuck you!

[groans]

935
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:07,068
I was wrong to call you a man.

[Adam screaming]

937
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:13,449
The rest of you are guilty
for bearing false witness.

938
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:15,117
The sentence is darkness.

939
00:58:15,201 --> 00:58:16,994
What? No, no, no. Please, please.

940
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:19,455
- Take them.

This family is owed retribution.

951

How was Samuel murdered?

952
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:07,044
Say the words.

953
00:59:07,128 --> 00:59:10,256
How was Samuel murdered?

954
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:20,850
He was struck in the head.

Don't do this, please.

Please. It's wrong.

It's barbaric.

Listen to me, listen to me.

Hmm?

Men and women of all races and creeds

Everyone works.
Everyone contributes.

We have no cancer, no poverty, no war.

He's designed homes, neighborhoods,
communities to be self-sufficient.

We're already self-sufficient.

1019
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:06,075
No, but you need maintenance,
improvements.

1020
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:08,827
You suffer storm damage, climate changes.

1021
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:11,413
Springs dry up. You need problems solved.

1022
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:12,915
That's what he does.

That's what he can contribute.

there's no safe way off this mountain.

[Venable] <i>Vee nor.</i>

1061
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:48,881
<i>Vee nor.</i>

1062
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:52,092
<i>Vee nor.</i> What...?

1063
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:54,261
"Friends?"

1064
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,846
Does that mean "friends?"

1065
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,686
- [laughs]
- [man grunts]

1066
01:07:06,899 --> 01:07:08,650
[Edith]
Come with me.

1067
01:07:27,753 --> 01:07:29,755
[door creaks open]

1068
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:00,494
[Venable] I've had no wife for a year.

1069
01:08:07,376 --> 01:08:10,128
She died in a fall.

1070
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:17,177
Here, people die
of either accidents or old age.

1071
01:08:21,473 --> 01:08:23,016
Can we ever leave?

1072
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,607
Why would you want to?

1073
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,537
I know about life below.

1074
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,206
You're alone.

1075
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:52,462
People come to the mountains
looking for something.

1076
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:57,968
Something to remind them
that life is worth living.

1077
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:05,767
You came looking for something.

1078
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:09,563
[sighs]

1079
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:12,899
And now you've found it.

1080
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,672
You're not as strong as you pretend to be.

1081
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:02,240
[phone line ringing]

1082
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,953
[Jen, over voicemail]
<i>Hey, it's Jen.</i>

1083
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,747
<i>Leave a message, and I'll hit you back.</i>

1084
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,499
<i>Thanks. Bye.</i>

1086
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,336

[phone rings]

1088
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:19,007
Hi.

1089
01:10:19,091 --> 01:10:21,551
<i>No. I don't know.</i>

1090
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:23,220
<i>Maybe a couple more days.</i>

1091
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:26,640
<i>I'm waiting to hear back
from the local police before I move on.</i>

1092
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,810
I know.

1093
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:32,687
She's, uh... she's missing.

1094
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:34,731
[country music playing]

1095
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:51,832
[sighs]

1096
01:10:52,958 --> 01:10:54,418
Hello.

1097
01:10:55,794 --> 01:10:57,838
I'm sorry about your daughter
and her friends.

1098
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:00,590
- [waitress] Double whiskey.
- Thank you.

1099
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:04,511
I told her to stay on the trail.

1100
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:08,890
There are people living on that mountain.

1101
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:12,894
What people?

1102
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,858
The Foundation.

1103
01:11:19,151 --> 01:11:20,861
The Foundation?

1104
01:11:20,944 --> 01:11:24,364
It's a story people here know
but don't talk about,

1105
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:26,241
except in whispers.

1106
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:27,868
Like a ghost story.

1107
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:29,161
Oh.

1108
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:34,749
In 1859, a dozen or so families
packed up and fled up the mountain.

1109
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:39,212
They feared the collapse of America,
and wanted to protect their way of life.

1110
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:41,590
They said when America fell,

1111
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:47,179
they would be the foundation
on which a new nation would be built.

1112
01:11:48,555 --> 01:11:52,350
And these descendants of these people

1113
01:11:52,434 --> 01:11:56,021
are still living up there on the mountain?

1114
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:58,607
We don't bother them,
and they don't bother us.

1115
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:04,321
But anyone who goes up there,
they don't come back...

1116
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:06,698
alive or dead.

1117
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,869
And you know this how?

1118
01:12:10,952 --> 01:12:13,371
It's happened before.

1119
01:12:13,455 --> 01:12:14,915
But if it's happened before,

1120
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:17,709
why hasn't someone
done something about it?

1121
01:12:18,627 --> 01:12:20,086
Because...

1122
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:23,757
it's made to look like they left.

1123
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:26,676
I'm sorry.

1124
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:51,201
[grunts]

1125
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:57,791
You just don't listen, do you, mister?

1126
01:13:04,673 --> 01:13:08,510
Your girl is dead,
and you don't want to find what's left.

1127
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,512
She's not dead.

1128
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:12,430
[all grunting]

1129
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,516
Oh, you son of a...

1130
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:17,435
[siren chirps]

1131
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:21,815
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1132
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,025
Hey.

1133
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:25,610
Hey!

1134
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,530
No, no, no.

1135
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,031
No! No!

1136
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:31,908
- Get him up.
- Hey!

1137
01:13:31,992 --> 01:13:34,911
You son of a bitch.

1138
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:44,087
[spits]

1139
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:01,688
Oh, shit.

1140
01:14:06,318 --> 01:14:08,236
What are you doing?

1141
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,988
What does it look like I'm doing?

1142
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:11,615
You don't want to go up there.

1143
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:14,326
She's my daughter. I'm gonna find her.

1144
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:15,285
Scott...

1145
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:17,579
And there's nothing you can do to stop me.

1146
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:19,372
Jesus. What happened?

1147
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,543
Whatever happened to you
is nothing compared to what they'll do.

1148
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:26,796
Wait.

1149
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:30,884
I could help you.

1150
01:14:46,191 --> 01:14:47,942
[car doors open and close]

1151
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:49,444
This him?

1152
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,071
Yes.

1153
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:52,614
Ed, this is Mr. Shaw.

1154
01:14:53,281 --> 01:14:56,117
Ed's my nephew. He's a hunter.

1155
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:58,036
You get in a car wreck or something?

1156
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:00,080
Or something.

1157
01:15:00,163 --> 01:15:01,831
You got the money?

1158
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:06,169
[Scott] Five thousand.

1159
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,630
[trunk closes]

1160
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:11,800
Okay.

1161
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,344
We'll see you in the morning, then.

1162
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,929
[Scott] No, no.

1163
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,639
We go now.

1164
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:20,892
You got gear?

1165
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,853
Can't go up there
dressed for no ladies' tea.

1166
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:25,480
You need glasses?

1167
01:15:25,563 --> 01:15:27,941
Backpack, sleeping bag, poles.

1168
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:29,818
Okay, okay, okay. Coop.

1169
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:32,362
Toss me my go bag.

1170
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:36,366
I got everything you need in there.

1171
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:39,077
Why don't you go and take that
yellow jacket off your back.

1172
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,287
Look like a fucking bull's-eye
walking around.

1173
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,747
Give the keys to Aileen.

1174
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:44,416
She'll park your car outside the inn,

1175
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,835
make it look like
you been there all night.

1176
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:48,878
Hey, let me ask you a question.

1177
01:15:48,962 --> 01:15:50,338
Why'd you agree to do this?

1178
01:15:50,422 --> 01:15:52,257
[Ed] Money.

1179
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,051
Got a son here I want to send
through welding school,

1180
01:15:55,135 --> 01:15:59,222
and I ain't got no love
for them Foundation fuckers.

1181
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:02,475
Arrow did that.

1182
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:04,978
Nineteen stitches.

1183
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:08,648
A warning shot across the old brain pan
to keep off of their mountain.

1184
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:11,776
Wouldn't mind returning the favor.

1185
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,085
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stay back.

1186
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:37,093
Stake trap.

1187
01:16:37,177 --> 01:16:39,637
Sneaky motherfuckers.

1188
01:16:39,721 --> 01:16:41,514
Get out of the creek.

1189
01:16:48,813 --> 01:16:51,107
[Ed] These Foundation folks
like to set traps like these

1190
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:53,026
to drive strangers up off the mountain.

1191
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:57,614
There's a second set further up
where I got my trophy.

1192
01:16:57,697 --> 01:17:00,200
What comes after the second set?

1193
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:02,869
Strangers don't get to leave.

1194
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,455
You walk where I walk.

1195
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,544
[exhales]

1196
01:17:13,505 --> 01:17:14,756
Jesus.

1197
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,257
How much further?

1198
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:19,052
There's a steep trail up along this ridge.

1199
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:21,971
I won't lie, though.
It's a bitch of a hike.

1200
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:24,557
But it shortcuts us right up
to the bastards' front door.

1201
01:17:24,641 --> 01:17:25,809
[screams]

1202
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:28,019
Cooper! Cooper!

1203
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:29,896
Cooper, you hurt?

1204
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:31,564
Are you all right?

1205
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:32,982
I think I twisted my ankle.

1206
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:35,109
Christ. Come on, help me pull him out.

1207
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:37,153
Okay, give me your hand.

1208
01:17:37,237 --> 01:17:38,696
[Cooper groans]

[grunts]

1210
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:44,536
[Scott] Give me your other hand.

1211
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:51,626
[groans]

1212
01:17:56,506 --> 01:17:57,882
[Ed] Come on. Come on.

1213
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:00,051
Come on.

1214
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,511
[grunts]

1215
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:18,319
[Scott] What?

1216
01:18:25,994 --> 01:18:27,704
Cooper?

1217
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,669
Jesus.

1218
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:12,290
[breathing heavily]

1219
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:16,586
One step at a time.

1220
01:19:54,374 --> 01:19:56,876
[twigs snap]

1221
01:19:58,211 --> 01:19:59,837

Darius?

1227
01:20:34,998 --> 01:20:37,250
Uh, it's me.

1228
01:20:41,129 --> 01:20:42,630
Where's Jen?

1229
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:46,759
What's happened to you?

1230
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:54,684
What the fuck is happening?

1231
01:20:57,437 --> 01:20:59,022
Where's my daughter?

1232
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:01,649
Stay back.

1233
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:09,657
[gunshots]

1234
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:12,827
What's wrong with you people?

1236

Jen?

1237

Jen.

1238
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:46,778
What have they done to you?

1239
01:21:56,871 --> 01:21:58,748
What have you done to my daughter?

1240
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:09,550
Whoever you are...
this woman is not your daughter.

1241
01:22:09,634 --> 01:22:12,345
She's my wife.

1242
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,263
What are you talking about?

1243
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:17,016
[speaking foreign language]

1244
01:22:18,726 --> 01:22:20,520
[all chanting in foreign language]

1245
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:22,021
[Scott] What the fuck is that?

1246
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:24,315
[Venable] No trial is necessary.

1247
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:27,318
We find this stranger guilty
of trespassing.

1248
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:30,905
The sentence is darkness,
to be carried out at dawn.

1249
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:32,782
What are you saying?

1250
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,492
Hey... Ah!

1251
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:38,704
You won't get away with this.

1252
01:22:38,788 --> 01:22:40,623
People will come for me.

1253
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:42,041
They know where I am!

1254
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:44,585
No. No one will ever come.

1255
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:46,379
[Scott] Jennifer!

1256
01:22:55,096 --> 01:22:57,390
[Venable] Are you all right?

1257
01:22:57,473 --> 01:22:59,600
I'm fine.

1258
01:22:59,684 --> 01:23:01,310
Why?

1259
01:23:01,394 --> 01:23:05,523
That man is your father.

1260
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:20,496
I've made my choice.

1261
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:30,047
[yelling]

1262
01:23:30,131 --> 01:23:32,967
[panting]
[grunting]

1263
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:44,312
[footsteps approaching]

1264
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:47,982
- [thumping]
- [rocks shifting]

1265
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:55,698
- Jen.
- Shh.

1266
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,492
[whispering] We don't have much time.

1267
01:23:58,576 --> 01:24:01,579
You found your way up here.
Do you know a safe way back?

1268
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:04,457
Okay.

1269
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,209
Let's go.

1270
01:24:11,005 --> 01:24:12,965
You shot me with an arrow.

1271
01:24:13,049 --> 01:24:15,009
They would've killed us both.

1272
01:24:15,092 --> 01:24:16,844
Come on, let's go.

1273
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:28,898
[gasps]
[pants]

1274
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:38,908
What is this?

1275
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:40,284
Time to leave.

1276
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:42,119
Why now?

1277
01:24:42,203 --> 01:24:44,413
Because tomorrow morning,
they're gonna kill my dad.

1278
01:24:45,164 --> 01:24:46,332
We need to go.

1279
01:24:46,415 --> 01:24:48,125
Come on.

1280
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:49,752
[Darius] I'm not going.

1281
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,839
What?

1282
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:55,800
These people see me.

1283
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:58,010
I belong to them.

1284
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,555
They belong to me.

1285
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:04,517
Go.

1286
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:07,520
I won't stop you.

1287
01:25:20,366 --> 01:25:22,827
Do you really think you can
go back to your old life?

1288
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:40,636
Stay close.

1289
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:50,021
This gate's never locked like this.

1290
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:53,149
Jen.

1291
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:02,074
Ruthie.

1292
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:04,744
I have to go.

1293
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:06,287
Do you understand?

1294
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:11,292
I know you like to sneak down
the mountain sometimes.

1295
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,127
Do you know another way out?

1296
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:58,005
Through there?

1297
01:26:58,089 --> 01:26:59,924
You're saying there's a way out
through there?

1298
01:27:15,106 --> 01:27:17,441
Do you want to come with me, Ruthie?

1299
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,695
You can if you want to.

1300
01:27:32,206 --> 01:27:34,583
[door opens]

1301
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:47,763
- [shouts in foreign language]
- [gunshot]

1302
01:27:47,847 --> 01:27:49,265
[gasps]

1303
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:56,730
Let's go.

1304
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,035
[croaking]

1305
01:29:42,336 --> 01:29:44,505
[Jen panting]

1306
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:48,968
[Scott] Aw, geez.

1307
01:29:50,553 --> 01:29:52,471
I barely made it up here in the daylight.

1308
01:29:52,555 --> 01:29:53,764
Shh!

1309
01:29:54,932 --> 01:29:56,433
[whispers] Did you hear that?

1310
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:04,191
[yelps]

1311
01:30:06,402 --> 01:30:08,779
[both grunting]

1312
01:30:14,577 --> 01:30:16,245
[Jen yelling]

1313
01:30:17,621 --> 01:30:19,790
[screams]

1314
01:30:19,873 --> 01:30:21,250
Jen!

1315
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:24,003
Jen!

1316
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:26,088
[men shouting distantly]

1317
01:30:34,221 --> 01:30:36,557
[gasps]

1318
01:30:38,267 --> 01:30:40,102
[panting]

1319
01:30:41,395 --> 01:30:42,855
[whispering] Dad.

1320
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:45,774
Dad.

1321
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:51,864
Jen?

1322
01:30:54,617 --> 01:30:56,118
Jen?

1323
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,012
[Hobbs] I can smell your juices.

1324
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:18,974
- [yells]
- [screams]

1325
01:31:21,894 --> 01:31:24,647
[gasping]

1326
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:30,235
After Venable takes your eyes,
your ears, and your tongue,

1327
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:31,862
I'm going to keep you for myself.

1328
01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:33,822
- [yells]
- [knife thuds]

1329
01:31:40,579 --> 01:31:42,289
[grunting]

1330
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:44,792
[screams]

1331
01:31:56,553 --> 01:31:57,680
Jen.

1332
01:32:09,066 --> 01:32:10,150
Jen?

1333
01:32:10,234 --> 01:32:11,443
[screams]

1334
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:21,245
- [knife slicing]
- [Jen panting]

1335
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:25,207
Jen.

1336
01:32:27,710 --> 01:32:29,086
Jennifer.

1337
01:32:39,638 --> 01:32:41,140
All right.

1338
01:32:41,223 --> 01:32:42,891
[sobbing softly]

1339
01:32:47,938 --> 01:32:49,690
Hey.

1340
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:05,706
[panting]

1341
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:17,968
[grunts]

1342
01:33:21,472 --> 01:33:22,848
[groans]

1343
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:38,655
[breathing heavily]

1344
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:41,033
What do we do now?

1345
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:45,287
All that matters now is the next choice.

1346
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,165
That's what I've learned on this mountain.

1347
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:52,419
That's how I've survived.

1348
01:33:58,592 --> 01:34:00,594
[gun clicks]

1349
01:34:12,105 --> 01:34:13,482
Let's go.

1350
01:34:25,661 --> 01:34:28,205
[gasping]

1351
01:34:28,372 --> 01:34:30,082
[panting] Which way?

1352
01:34:35,879 --> 01:34:37,589
Told you I'd see you again.

1353
01:34:38,507 --> 01:34:41,260
Back the fuck up!

1354
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:42,803
Whoa, wait a minute. We're here to help.

1355
01:34:42,886 --> 01:34:44,847
- Bullshit.
- And fuck you, too.

1356
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:47,724
Hey, mister, I was trying
to save your life back there.

1357
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:51,228
I figured a good beat down
might send your ass packing.

1358
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:53,063
And you.

1359
01:34:53,146 --> 01:34:56,191
That yellow in my eyes...

1360
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:58,735
was my liver turning on me.

1361
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:00,445
You were right.

1362
01:35:01,572 --> 01:35:04,199
Look, I ain't got any kids.

1363
01:35:04,283 --> 01:35:09,454
But my nephew disappeared
in these woods six years ago.

1364
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:12,624
And I never found the body.

1365
01:35:12,708 --> 01:35:14,751
Fucking Foundation.

1366
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:18,380
I'd like to shoot every one
of those sons of bitches.

1367
01:35:19,965 --> 01:35:21,717
Where's your friends?

1368
01:35:22,593 --> 01:35:24,386
It's just us.

1369
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:27,347
Well, then, let's get you
the hell off this mountain.

1370
01:35:29,975 --> 01:35:31,602
Come on.

1371
01:35:39,026 --> 01:35:40,736
Ah!

1372
01:35:45,449 --> 01:35:47,326
- [Lloyd] Fuck!
- [Scott] No, no, no!

1373
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:50,203
- I'll get you.
- [Osborn] Where the fuck is it?

1374
01:35:56,627 --> 01:35:58,545
[Jen groaning loudly]

1375
01:35:58,629 --> 01:36:00,380
[screams]

1376
01:36:01,924 --> 01:36:03,634
[Nate] I think we got 'em.

1377
01:36:03,717 --> 01:36:05,844
[Jen breathing heavily]

1378
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:16,563
[meaty thud]

1379
01:36:21,485 --> 01:36:23,028
[Jen groaning]

1380
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:26,531
[Nate] Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1381
01:36:28,659 --> 01:36:30,327
[truck doors slam]

1382
01:36:30,494 --> 01:36:32,371
[Venable] Jennifer!

1383
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:35,165
[Nate] Get in the truck.

1384
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:36,667
Get in.

1385
01:36:38,085 --> 01:36:39,544
[engine starts]

1386
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:49,888
[glass shatters]

1387
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:44,151
[Nate] It's my Great-Uncle Willie's
special recipe.

1388
01:37:47,029 --> 01:37:48,864
All right, suit yourself.

1389
01:38:25,317 --> 01:38:28,195
I want to set that footing
by tomorrow evening.

1390
01:38:28,278 --> 01:38:30,197
- Yeah. Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, Dad.

1391
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:31,907
I brought you the revised blueprints

1392
01:38:31,990 --> 01:38:33,742
- for the North Caldwell house.
- Oh, you're kidding.

1393
01:38:33,825 --> 01:38:35,702
You didn't need to bring them
all the way down here.

1394
01:38:35,786 --> 01:38:37,412
I know you wanted to see them right away.

1395
01:38:37,496 --> 01:38:40,373
I also know you're gonna hate
the new master bath.

1396
01:38:40,457 --> 01:38:42,125
Well, you did warn me.

1397
01:38:42,209 --> 01:38:43,293
Mm-hm.

1398
01:38:45,629 --> 01:38:46,838
What?

1399
01:38:46,922 --> 01:38:49,132
Nothing. I'm just proud of you.

1400
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:51,968
Thanks, Dad.

1401
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:55,430
Come on.

1402
01:38:58,809 --> 01:39:00,435
I love you.

1403
01:39:00,519 --> 01:39:02,312
I love you, too.

1404
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:09,569
Well, good night.

1405
01:39:09,653 --> 01:39:10,987
I'll see you at home.

1406
01:39:12,489 --> 01:39:14,282
Oh, and remember,
it's pizza and movie night,

1407
01:39:14,366 --> 01:39:15,867
so don't be late.

1408
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:19,412
The boys picked something
with inbred cannibals?

1409
01:39:19,496 --> 01:39:20,914
Again?

1410
01:39:21,957 --> 01:39:24,417
- Geez.
- [laughs]

1411
01:39:25,418 --> 01:39:27,337
- [keys rattle]
- [engine starts]

1412
01:39:43,395 --> 01:39:46,106
- [laughter]
- [indistinct chatter]

1413
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,651
[Miles] It's a privacy screen.

1414
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:51,069
- [man] Oh.
- [Miles] Yeah.

1415
01:39:51,153 --> 01:39:52,362
You can't see it from the side.

1416
01:39:52,445 --> 01:39:54,030
[Corinne] All right, here we go.

1417
01:39:54,114 --> 01:39:55,490
Oh, hi, hon.

1418
01:39:55,574 --> 01:39:59,369
Uh, meet our new neighbors,
John and Ruthie.

1419
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:02,247
They're looking at the Kaplan
house down the street.

1420
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:03,832
Nothing is set in stone yet.

1421
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:06,293
[Corinne]
Well, it turns out John knows Scott.

1422
01:40:06,376 --> 01:40:08,837
[Venable] Our paths crossed.

1423
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:13,341
Said if I was ever in the neighborhood
to stop by and meet the family.

1424
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:16,136
[Corinne] Small world, right?

1425
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:19,222
Yes. Very.

1426
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:24,144
Are you going to put those groceries down?

1427
01:40:26,062 --> 01:40:27,314
[Venable] Corinne...

1428
01:40:27,397 --> 01:40:29,941
this coffee is wonderful, thank you.

1429
01:40:30,901 --> 01:40:33,069
[Corinne] Uh, can you stay for dinner?

1430
01:40:33,153 --> 01:40:35,780
I'm sure Scott would love to see you.

1431
01:40:35,864 --> 01:40:38,116
We're having pizza.

1432
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,035
Yes.

1433
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:43,079
We would love to stay.

1434
01:40:43,163 --> 01:40:45,207
It's been a long drive.

1435
01:40:46,625 --> 01:40:49,544
- Thank you.
- Oh, be right back.

1436
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:54,132
And I see you're eating for two.

1437
01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:58,303
Congratulations.

1438
01:40:58,386 --> 01:41:00,180
I need to use the bathroom.

1439
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:28,041
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- [Corinne] Jen!

1440
01:41:28,124 --> 01:41:31,253
Put your weapon down,
or I kill your family.

1441
01:41:34,756 --> 01:41:36,549
I was wrong about you, Jen.

1442
01:41:38,051 --> 01:41:39,344
You are strong.

1443
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:42,264
I had to be if I was ever
gonna get away from you.

1444
01:41:42,347 --> 01:41:44,140
Now it's time to come home.

1445
01:41:44,224 --> 01:41:46,393
What's the point? You have to kill me.

1446
01:41:46,476 --> 01:41:47,394
[Venable] Yes.

1447
01:41:48,478 --> 01:41:51,147
But not until our child is born.

1448
01:41:53,692 --> 01:41:56,069
Congratulations, Grandma.

1449
01:41:56,486 --> 01:41:58,697
[yells]

1450
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:08,790
[grunts]

1451
01:42:11,293 --> 01:42:12,961
[gasping softly]

1452
01:42:23,555 --> 01:42:24,848
[Corinne] Jen...

1453
01:42:27,434 --> 01:42:29,644
what are you doing?

1454
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,230
Jen?

1455
01:42:36,443 --> 01:42:38,320
[Jen] Mom?

1456
01:42:39,487 --> 01:42:41,239
Can you and the boys excuse us?

1457
01:42:41,323 --> 01:42:43,992
John's here to talk business.

1458
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:46,703
Of course. Come on. Laundry.

1459
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:50,790
Come on. You want pizza? Mush.

1460
01:43:04,471 --> 01:43:06,639
I was wrong about you, Jen.

1461
01:43:06,723 --> 01:43:09,142
You are strong.

1462
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:12,687
I had to be if I was ever
gonna get away from you.

1463
01:43:12,771 --> 01:43:15,273
You let us make you strong.

1464
01:43:15,357 --> 01:43:17,692
That's good.

1465
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:20,570
You're carrying my child, so...

1466
01:43:23,531 --> 01:43:25,325
time to come home.

1467
01:43:29,454 --> 01:43:31,081
Promise me you won't hurt them.

1468
01:43:34,084 --> 01:43:35,460
Ever.

1469
01:43:37,879 --> 01:43:39,964
You'll never come back here.

1470
01:43:41,257 --> 01:43:42,967
Promise, and I'll go with you.

1471
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:45,804
You have my word.
