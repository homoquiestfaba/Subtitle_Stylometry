1
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,460
Okay, hello, everybody.

2
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:12,369
The story I'm going to tell you
right now is 110% a real story,

3
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,396
which only makes it better.

4
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,012
So there was this old lady

5
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,377
walking out
of the grocery store,

6
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,245
checking her receipts
and just making sure

7
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,944
she didn't get ripped off
or anything

8
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,009
when she finds
that these three guys

9
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,715
are breaking into her car.

10
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,849
She can't believe it,
so what does she do?

11
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,290
She puts down her groceries,

12
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,659
and she pulls out
this huge gun,

13
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,256
Iike. 50-something caliber.

14
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,596
Then she yells at the guys,

15
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:45,195
"Get away from my car,
you ding-dong!"

16
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,297
And the three ding-dongs
just put up their hands.

17
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,830
They're like,
"What's going on here? "

18
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,638
They run away.

19
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,508
I mean, they just skedaddle.

20
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,946
Then the lady,
she gets into her car,

21
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,817
and then she tries the key,
and it won't turn,

22
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,412
and she's thinking,

23
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,221
"What the heck is going on?

24
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:09,922
What is all this weird stuff
in my car? "

25
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,060
Then it hits her.

26
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,763
This isn't her car.

27
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:25,670
There were two cars
that looked exactly the same.

28
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:26,679
Right?

29
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,975
Does-
does everybody get it?

30
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:31,711
So then she goes
to the police station

31
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,185
to, like,
tell them what happened,

32
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,884
and the cop there
is just cracking up.

33
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,393
I mean, he is-
he is cracking up

34
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,418
Iike he's never heard
something so funny,

35
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:48,628
because those other guys were
just in there to tell on her,

36
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,296
and then she comes in there.

37
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,100
So it's like, his job is done,

38
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,538
and he is just-

39
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,134
he is cracking up
at the whole thing.

40
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,939
I mean, obviously
no charges were filed,

41
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,312
and then everybody was safe
and everything.

42
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,078
But the moral is,

43
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:07,279
and then-
you'll like this, Gloria-

44
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,551
is if you're going to have
a senior moment,

45
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,558
make it a memorable one.

46
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,462
How does this pertain to
our discussion on Deuteronomy?

47
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,192
What does this have
to do with-

48
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,666
Uh...

49
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,601
Father William,
where does Christ's word

50
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,762
come into this story?

51
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,204
Well, that-that story
really didn't have

52
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,537
anything to do with Christ.

53
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:34,377
It-it was more of a joke story
for older people, for-

54
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,574
it was for seniors.

55
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,014
But what's its significance?

56
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,815
Gloria, if you want to ruin
the story by overanalyzing it,

57
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,344
then, you know,
congratulations.

58
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,515
That's what you did.

59
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,117
It's more just-
well, okay.

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,392
Jesus is okay
if we make mistakes, right?

61
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,127
Right, okay, so I guess, yeah,
that's how it works out.

62
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,533
So he's okay
if we make mistakes,

63
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,469
and this old lady
made a mistake,

64
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,473
and there-
see, it-it relates.

65
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,237
Okay, well, this was great.

66
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,575
Um... I'll see you guys
next week, all right?

67
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,741
In the name of the Father, Son,
Holy Spirit, amen.

68
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:10,749
All right.

69
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,250
Father?

70
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,411
Are we going to sing?

71
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:17,483
Uh, okay, yes.

72
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,649
Uh, we'll sing.

73
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:33,298
# Ho, hosanna in the highest #

74
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:39,278
# Ho, hosanna in the highest #

75
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,279
Great.

76
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,008
Bye.

77
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,076
Hello, everybody.

78
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,316
It's me, Shane Lee.

79
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,382
I'm going to sing five octaves
on the piano.

80
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,613
What?

81
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,987
Dude, what are you doing?

82
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,720
Dude.

83
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,727
# Ah #

84
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,000
You are insane.

85
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,343
Oh, dude.

86
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,607
Oh, yeah, it's like that-

87
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,707
Dude, it all sounds the same.

88
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,310
Uh, I'll catch up with you
later, Father Tim.

89
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,446
- # Ah #

90
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:58,013
Father William?

91
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,218
This doesn't look like
catechism studies.

92
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,692
Oh, Father O'Herlihey,
have you seen this video?

93
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:08,962
He's trying to-

94
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,094
Our computer's not
for clowning around.

95
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,401
Father, the story you told
about the old woman and the gun,

96
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,963
where did you hear that?

97
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,498
That is actually
in the book of Job.

98
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,408
No, it's not.

99
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,844
Father, if you're gonna
tell a story

100
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,677
that's not directly related
to the Good Book,

101
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,082
you're gonna have to
at least make it relevant,

102
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,747
you know, somewhat truthful
or thought-provoking.

103
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,881
These people come to us
for Bible study,

104
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,914
not internet study.

105
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,620
You're not up here to, uh...

106
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,786
just to have fun with them.

107
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,193
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

108
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,492
Mm-hmm.

109
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,465
Father, the bishop and l
were talking about

110
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,025
making your holiday a little
earlier this year, and-

111
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,366
I got the letter.

112
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,894
Well, what we're looking for,
Father,

113
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,031
is for you to go out
and find the truth.

114
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,542
I mean, you have to ask yourself
some real tough questions like,

115
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,100
"What am I doing here?"'

116
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,612
Why did you join the seminary,
Father?

117
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,941
Questions like that.

118
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,643
Oh, oh, wait, oh,
that's my phone.

119
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,151
Uh, it's, um...

120
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,183
I'll get it later.

121
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,280
How about travel options?

122
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,813
Have you looked
into that at all?

123
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,485
Yes, I have,

124
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,894
and my mother and l
were going to go to the Poconos.

125
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,296
That's where she went
on her honeymoon with my father.

126
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,095
They have these bathtubs

127
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,365
that are shaped like wine
or communion glasses.

128
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,167
But, yeah, it was
a little too expensive,

129
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,901
and my mom didn't want to travel
that far.

130
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,533
That's wise.

131
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:27,637
But then, I got into contact
with my sister's ex-boyfriend,

132
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,810
and he was, like, the first
inspiration for me, you know?

133
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,910
He was, like,
my first real role model.

134
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,615
I mean, he is
a professional musician now

135
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,521
that's on the road,

136
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,150
and we're gonna have a reunion.

137
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,353
And guess what.

138
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:45,558
Us dudes are gonna hit the water
in a canoe.

139
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,995
That's a grand idea.

140
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,332
You think so?

141
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,496
Well, it's-it'll do you
a world of good.

142
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,199
But remember
when you're out there,

143
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,640
the real truth
can't be found in here.

144
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,645
The real answers are out there

145
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,807
and in here.

146
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,944
Do you understand?

147
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,352
Yo, Robbie!

148
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,411
Robbie!

149
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,549
Hey, I got us
a table already, man.

150
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,956
Wow.
Look at you.

151
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,759
It's great to see you, man.
Have a seat.

152
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,161
I got us some milk already.

153
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,359
We got some cheese sticks
and some other things coming.

154
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,766
You can have just
whatever you want, all right?

155
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,202
Ah, man, Robbie.

156
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:03,971
I sent you email after email
after email after email,

157
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,808
and then I thought, "l have got
to have the wrong address."

158
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,711
But then I thought,
"Maybe your assistant

159
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,579
"reads through all your emails

160
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,811
and takes out all the fans
and the loony birds in there."

161
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,217
And then I thought,

162
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,244
"Well, I hope they don't mistake
me for one of those."

163
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,449
I don't-does your-

164
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,718
No, I don't-
I don't have one.

165
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:19,747
Right, of course, right.

166
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,054
You could do it.
Well, yeah.

167
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,321
Oh, man.

168
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,828
Can I get you two
something to drink?

169
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:24,887
Coffee, please, yes.

170
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,195
I want a refill of the milk,

171
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,964
and I'll also have a coffee
like Robbie, please?

172
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,233
Thank you.

173
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,536
Um, when I was driving
over here-

174
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,769
I knew it.

175
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,242
I knew-I knew
you would come in here

176
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,642
and just start with a story.

177
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,704
This is just-
it's like time has not stopped.

178
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,978
Oh, man, you were
such a great writer, Robbie.

179
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,245
I'm not a writer.

180
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,879
Okay, you are a musician
and a writer,

181
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,389
but, Robbie,
no baloney at all,

182
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,383
I like your work equally,
musician and writer.

183
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,728
I mean, that novelette
you wrote, ooh.

184
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,426
How do you know about that?

185
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,129
I mean, how many people
write novelettes in high school?

186
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,296
About zero.

187
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,101
Wait a minute,
how did you-

188
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,663
I don't understand
how you read that.

189
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,609
Okay, she would kill me
if I tell you,

190
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,444
but when you guys were dating,
my sister let me read it.

191
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,176
Your sister.

192
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,615
Oh, no.

193
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,245
Now I'm getting myself
into trouble here,

194
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,517
but I just-
I love that.

195
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,217
I-oh, ding.

196
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,554
Saved by the food.

197
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,958
Our mozzarella sticks.

198
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,189
Oh, that's wonderful.

199
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,423
Smells terrific.

200
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,022
lsn't it a little early
for this stuff?

201
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,965
No, I got up at 4:00 a. m.

202
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,162
You got the combo plate.

203
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,431
Okay, thank you.

204
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,597
Thank you.

205
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,504
Anything else for you,
Father Billy?

206
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,632
Do you want anything else?

207
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:43,664
Uh-uh.

208
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,176
This is-this-
too much.

209
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,735
Chicken tenders.
-Chicken tenders.

210
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,007
Mm-hmm.
-All right.

211
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,108
Will you sign my Bible?

212
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,515
My great-grandfather
gave me that Bible

213
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,456
when I was six years old,

214
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,585
and now I use it
as an autograph book.

215
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,686
I got the guy who played
Father Guido Sarducci

216
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,718
to sign in it.

217
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,254
Wow.

218
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:11,258
And now I want you to sign it
since you're a celebrity.

219
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,463
I'm not a celebrity.

220
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,839
Oh, yeah,
what about Defrockation?

221
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:17,900
Thank you.

222
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,308
What about what?

223
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,074
Defrockation.

224
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,444
I don't know what that is.

225
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,850
Do not play like
you don't know Defrockation.

226
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,148
l-I don't know what that is.

227
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,251
You're the guitarist
for the band Defrockation.

228
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,091
Who said that?
-Google.

229
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,587
I Googled you,
Robbie Shoemaker.

230
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,796
It says you're the guitarist
for the band Defrockation,

231
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,997
and it says that you guys
are looking for a roadie.

232
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,437
Oh, man.
-And I thought I might-

233
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,338
That's not me.
That's not me.

234
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,574
I haven't played guitar in,
I don't know, 15 years maybe.

235
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,671
But you're on the road.

236
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,012
I'm on the road,
but it's like-

237
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,846
it's not Defrockation.

238
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,149
I mean, nothing near that.

239
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,519
I'm not in a band, man.

240
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,421
I'm sorry to burst your bubble.

241
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:13,655
Do you-do you like boats?

242
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,189
Yeah.

243
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,601
Do you like, um, water?

244
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,969
Yes.

245
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:24,339
We should do a canoe trip
this afternoon.

246
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,365
Dude, I don't know.

247
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,606
lt'll be a blast.

248
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,376
Come on,
it'll be fun.

249
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:34,978
No job,
no freaking wife out there.

250
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,648
No freaking kids.

251
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,180
No freaking...

252
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,386
parishioners.

253
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,190
I got to leave
at 6:00 in the morning.

254
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,719
I'll buy.
I'll buy the food.

255
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,222
I'll buy the trip.
I'll buy your beer.

256
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,394
I'll even buy some extra smokes.

257
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,836
Just you and me relaxing,

258
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,806
having fun,

259
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,971
paddling, solitude, come on.

260
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,001
All right.

261
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,172
Yes!

262
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,852
I have a bad feeling
we're gonna have to shit

263
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:09,877
in, like, 10 minutes.

264
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,890
That's a lot of grease.

265
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,552
We probably will need
to go to the bathroom.

266
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,322
All right, dig in.

267
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,829
- # My main man, Jesus is #

268
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,305
# My main man #

269
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,173
# Jesus is my main man #

270
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,344
You ever heard
that song before?

271
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,544
It's Jesus is My Main Man.

272
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,711
Did you write that?

273
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:41,913
Yes.

274
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,012
Oh.

275
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,614
Guess if this is real or fake.

276
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,027
Fake.

277
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,518
Real or fake?

278
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,828
Fake.

279
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,834
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

280
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,765
That's not funny.

281
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,239
How many Hail Marys is that?

282
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,835
It's none because this is
not a confessional.

283
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:07,709
Do you want to confess
something to me?

284
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:08,940
Robbie.

285
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,744
Priests don't ever
get to confess, do they?

286
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,445
Why don't you
confess something to me?

287
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:14,884
For real?

288
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,046
Yes.

289
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:25,862
I've never been happy.

290
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,260
Really?

291
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,794
Yup.

292
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:47,474
Is your hand on the wall
right now like mine is?

293
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,852
No.

294
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,879
It's not?

295
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,118
I got my hand on my wall.

296
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,626
I feel like we're connecting.

297
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,665
That's weird, Billy.

298
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,100
- # Ho hosanna #

299
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,730
# Ho, ho, hosanna #

300
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:09,332
# Ho, ho,
hosanna #

301
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,275
# He is Lord #

302
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,834
Yeah, here's your Bible.

303
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,175
Here's your Bible.

304
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,408
- # Ho, ho, hosanna #

305
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,212
# He is Lord #

306
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,049
# Ho, ho, hosanna #

307
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,214
# Ho, ho,
hosanna #

308
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,918
# Ho, ho, hosanna #

309
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,223
# He is #

310
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,793
Yeah, can you give him
a high five?

311
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,599
Can you give him a high five?

312
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:40,696
Yeah?

313
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:41,728
Yeah?
Okay.

314
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,763
All right, let's go.

315
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,969
Let's get in the car.

316
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:51,178
Hey, anyone work here?

317
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,677
Your toilet is broken.

318
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,553
This has got to go down.

319
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,991
It's got to go.

320
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,463
Oh, jeez maneeze,
that's a lot.

321
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,897
Oh, jeez maneeze.

322
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,812
Do you want me
to pull over again?

323
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,315
No.

324
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,215
I lost my Bible.

325
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,582
What?

326
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,110
I lost my Bible.

327
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,452
In the bathroom?

328
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,551
Well, let's go get it.

329
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,787
I'll pull-
I'll turn around.

330
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,817
Let's go back and get it.

331
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,022
No, just leave it, all right?

332
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,052
It fell in.

333
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,156
It fell in the toilet.

334
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,495
It's not funny.

335
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,695
Well, I bet, you know,
they probably have something

336
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,931
to fish stuff out of the toilet.

337
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:47,165
Forget about it.

338
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:50,175
I dropped my Bible
in a pile of diarrhea.

339
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,976
Why, why, why
did I have coffee?

340
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,572
I never drink coffee,

341
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,048
and the one day I drink coffee,

342
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,881
of course,
of course it's the day

343
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,752
that I drop my Bible
in the toilet.

344
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:11,259
Do not ever, ever, ever
let me drink coffee again, ever.

345
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,637
Ugh, why did I eat
jalapeno poppers?

346
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,899
Sorry, Billy.

347
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,134
All right, so you start out
at the big lake here...

348
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,303
Mm-hmm.

349
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,903
And then a little turn
in the bend there,

350
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,470
and you come around
down through here,

351
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,813
and you end up
right at this clearing.

352
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:32,839
That looks long.

353
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,874
How long is that one?

354
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,011
Well, it's about six hours.

355
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,043
No, no, no, no, no.

356
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,077
What's-do you have-

357
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,111
what's your shortest one?

358
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,317
You could do this one here.

359
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,985
It's about three, four hours.

360
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,254
That's great.
That's better.

361
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,852
That's more of
what you're looking for?

362
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,193
Yeah, yeah, yes.

363
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,028
You can pick up your paddles
and your vests outside,

364
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,432
and, uh, what are we talking,

365
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,935
one, two canoes?

366
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,368
No, we don't need
to be together.

367
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,393
Two, yeah.

368
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,566
Okay.
-Hey, Billy?

369
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,199
I'm gonna do two separate boats.

370
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,231
Is that cool?

371
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,266
How hard is it?

372
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,608
I've never been
on a boat before.

373
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,011
You've never been on a-

374
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,036
you'll be great.

375
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,310
You'll be fine.

376
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,839
Two is-he'll be fine.
-How much is it?

377
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,011
- $22 each.

378
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,042
I got $40.

379
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,851
So if you want beer...

380
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,486
We'll do one and beer.

381
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,687
All right.
-Yeah.

382
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,355
One canoe.

383
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,126
As you're coming down
to the end of this run,

384
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,223
you'll be in the middle of-

385
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,070
It empties out into a little,
small lake there and there's-

386
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:32,468
You're gonna go under
a railroad trestle.

387
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,569
It's the only thing around.

388
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,943
There ain't nothing else there.

389
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,413
As long as you get there
before 6:00,

390
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,609
someone will be there
to pick you up.

391
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,551
That way,
nobody gets left.

392
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,021
So this is
your normal clientele?

393
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,751
Hello!
-Hello!

394
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,954
We need a boat for freedom.

395
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:53,192
We need all of your ships.

396
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,298
We take everyone's freedom.

397
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,326
Freedom desu!

398
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,100
We need a sleeping bag.

399
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,903
Tent.
-Toilet paper.

400
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:04,841
Water.
-Motorcycle.

401
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,708
Shampoo.
-Helmet.

402
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,212
Chocolate.
-Cigarette.

403
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,236
Twinkies.

404
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,908
Beef jerky.

405
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,940
Everything.
-Everything.

406
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,577
We need a paddle.

407
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,609
So you want to buy a boat?

408
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,053
We have the money.

409
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,852
Give it to me now.

410
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,825
You ladies can have just about
anything you like.

411
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,848
Thank you.

412
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:22,861
We need a Twinkie.

413
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:23,884
Corn nuts.

414
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,157
You can get your stuff
outside.

415
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,868
Robbie, what size life jacket
do you wear?

416
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:44,442
Come on down here.

417
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,043
Do you think
a blue life jacket,

418
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,450
or a yellow life jacket
is safer?

419
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,511
Shut up.

420
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,250
Give me your wallet,
your cell phone,

421
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,884
and your car keys.

422
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:54,915
Why?

423
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,054
- 'Cause I'm robbing you, okay?

424
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,961
You think I want to get
in a canoe?

425
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,190
No.

426
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,702
Sorry.
-I'm fucking with you.

427
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,725
I'm fucking with you.

428
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,068
If they go in the river,

429
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,766
I'm not diving in after 'em,
dude, all right?

430
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,035
You're messing with me?

431
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,167
Yeah, I'm fucking with you.

432
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,199
Oh.

433
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:13,233
Okay, that's a good idea.

434
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,870
Oh, you know what?

435
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:18,576
I wish I brought some galoshes,
'cause they're gonna get wet.

436
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,552
Galosh-
did you just say "galoshes"?

437
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,316
Galoshes.

438
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,549
Dude.

439
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,717
Here, you can borrow these.

440
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,191
Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

441
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,216
Thank you.

442
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,353
You're welcome.

443
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,919
One more little trick.

444
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,364
This might be a little more like
what you remember me by.

445
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,863
You used to wear that
every single day in high school.

446
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,373
You do remember that shit,
don't you?

447
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,398
Well, there's a picture of you
and Stu Prichard

448
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,810
in the mother-freaking yearbook
going like that.

449
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,110
In the mother-freaking yearbook.

450
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,480
What is that about?

451
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:01,048
Did you see
what they drove up in?

452
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,721
Those girls
are not hurting for money.

453
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,001
Look, here,
so we can match.

454
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,263
We do match.

455
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,639
No, evil, dude.

456
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:26,406
Better.

457
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,975
Better?
-Yeah.

458
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,392
Hey, Billy?
-Yeah?

459
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,526
Look at me.

460
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,126
Hold your hand on the top of it,
all right?

461
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,262
Dig.

462
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,795
Pull towards you, okay?

463
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,272
How do I steer?
-No, don't.

464
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,935
I'm gonna steer back here,
all right?

465
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,034
You're pure manpower.

466
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,066
You're the engine.

467
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,373
I'm the engine?

468
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,005
All right, I'm the-
you're the engine.

469
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,606
I'm the wheel.
I'm the rudder.

470
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,638
Just dig.

471
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,015
I mean, really dig into it.
-Okay.

472
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,610
Have you seriously
never been in a boat?

473
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,985
I just haven't been
on small boats.

474
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,217
Like what,
cruise ships or something?

475
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,158
Yeah, I've been on
a lot of cruise ships before.

476
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,660
Jesus Christ.

477
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,759
Man, this is beautiful.

478
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,792
There's less fishes
than I thought there would be.

479
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:26,605
You want one?

480
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:29,910
No, I should concentrate
on, um, this.

481
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:33,315
No sex, no drugs,
no rock and roll.

482
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:37,652
No, plenty of rock and roll.

483
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,213
Well, at least
you got that, right?

484
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,020
Yeah, you're the one
that got me into that.

485
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,425
Really?
-Yeah!

486
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,454
I'd get into whatever you guys
were talking about at school.

487
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,659
When you wore
a Lizzie Borden shirt,

488
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,964
I went out
and bought their album.

489
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,163
When you talked about
Judas Priest,

490
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,435
that's what made me
want to become a priest.

491
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,463
You're shitting me.

492
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,033
Yeah, I'm just razzing you.

493
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,978
But seriously, your band
was the only band I saw live

494
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,208
for, like, 22 years.

495
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,740
My favorite song of yours
was Black Toilet

496
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:09,618
about what it was like
to be Satan's toilet

497
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,748
and have Satan come
and take a crap on you.

498
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,686
I used that at church once
as an anti-drug lecture.

499
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,357
It really connected
with the kids.

500
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,630
My band, we were cool,

501
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,602
but we never
did anything that cool.

502
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,400
You were in a band?

503
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,272
Yeah, I was in a band,
Tree of Joshua.

504
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,436
Oh, I did keyboards
and vocal harmonies.

505
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:36,413
We-we pushed some buttons.

506
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,279
Yeah, what buttons were those?

507
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,410
Well, I wrote a song called
The 11th Commandment,

508
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,045
and basically what it was about

509
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,421
is that Moses had
an extra commandment

510
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,857
that he didn't share
with anybody,

511
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:48,985
that he kept for himself

512
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,655
so he could be
the most coolest dude,

513
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:53,493
and that commandment was

514
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:56,023
the right to rock and roll.

515
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,329
Wow.

516
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,769
And so, basically,
the song started real slow

517
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,365
where we'd just list
the first 10 commandments

518
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,899
sort of, like, slow
and then sad and-

519
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,206
Billy, paddle.

520
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:08,473
Okay.

521
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,105
And so, uh...

522
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,137
where was l?

523
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:13,879
Oh, the right
to rock and roll.

524
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,978
Yeah, so, we hit
the 11th commandment,

525
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,079
and we just started...

526
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:27,656
And then Moses was like,
"Thou shall rock and roll!"

527
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,530
Oh!

528
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:32,503
Our band made Moses cool.

529
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,402
Dude, I would've killed
to see that.

530
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:38,466
Well, actually, we never
really got the chance to play it

531
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,943
'cause the other people
in the band,

532
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,913
they thought it was sacrilegious
to add a commandment, so...

533
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,882
Well, you can rest assured

534
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,214
that they probably wouldn't have
let you in the priesthood

535
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:50,710
if you were in a metal band,
so you probably did all right.

536
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,924
What's it like?

537
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,396
What's what like?

538
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:03,697
You know, living the rock
and roll lifestyle, touring?

539
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:04,929
Why do you think
I'm in a band?

540
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,130
Why do you keep bringing this up

541
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,162
when I keep telling you
that I am not?

542
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,673
You're on the road
all the time.

543
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,232
That's what you said,
you're touring.

544
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,834
Yeah, I'm on the road,
and I'm touring,

545
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,210
but, man,
I'm with the crew.

546
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,511
I'm a s-

547
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,450
spotlight operator.

548
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:24,979
Okay, good one,
a spotlight operator.

549
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,354
Come on.

550
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,163
You're being serious?

551
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,859
Yes.

552
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,630
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

553
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:41,730
Well, you-how bad can it be?

554
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,172
lce Capades.

555
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,800
Who are the lce Capades?

556
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:48,609
Just-Billy, just be quiet
for a little while, all right?

557
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,274
Look ahead, paddle, just-

558
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:54,217
just be quiet
for a little while.

559
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:21,571
Maria had never been in love
until she met Miguel.

560
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:26,607
And Miguel, he was a man
she hardly even knew.

561
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,744
Miguel was a highway worker.

562
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:29,947
He was one of those guys

563
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,683
who built the overpasses
and bridges

564
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,089
that 99% of the people
driving on

565
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,685
didn't even realize existed.

566
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:38,696
They constructed
these things quickly,

567
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,357
Iike an assembly line,

568
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,298
and, well, Miguel,
he slipped

569
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,926
and he fell into
the vat of cement

570
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,459
as it was being poured,

571
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:48,131
and these things being the
assembly lines that they are,

572
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,664
they just-
they kept moving,

573
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,576
and by the time anyone realized
what had happened,

574
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,944
I mean, just minutes later,

575
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:59,144
the cement
was already hardening.

576
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,012
Well, the workers made him
an air hole,

577
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:08,150
but because of previous delays
on the job,

578
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,024
they couldn't re-pour
the concrete,

579
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:13,497
so Miguel,
he stayed in there.

580
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:16,159
The workers pledged to come by
and feed him every day,

581
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,466
but soon, they began
to forget about him.

582
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:21,836
By chance,
Miguel met Maria

583
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:25,604
while she was out on a walk
looking for her lost cat.

584
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:28,044
She found him just as he was
losing hope of his own,

585
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,910
and the two,

586
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:31,973
they eventually fell in love.

587
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,315
Te amo.

588
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,359
Te amo.

589
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,518
Now, she knows
nothing more about him

590
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,722
but this little
3 inch by 3 inches of his face,

591
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:19,855
but she visits him each day,

592
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:23,356
and they just-
they pass time together,

593
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,335
Iistening to
the traffic pass...

594
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,776
Sitting quietly
under the highway.

595
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:43,445
And then what?

596
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:45,183
And then what, what?

597
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,623
And then what happens?

598
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,058
That's it.

599
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,083
That's it?

600
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:51,459
Mm-hmm.

601
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,693
Like, do they get married
or have a baby,

602
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,394
and if they had a baby,
how would that work?

603
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,026
No.

604
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,798
You didn't write that?

605
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:02,170
No.

606
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,573
What if he popped a, uh...

607
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,839
Popped a what?

608
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,573
An erection?

609
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:09,602
A boner?

610
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,775
Yes, yes, yes, okay.

611
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:15,342
What if he pops one of those

612
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:19,220
and his penis boner
was so strong

613
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,350
that it just went up like,

614
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,189
boing, boing,
boing, boing, boing?

615
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,561
And as his penis boner
is going up and down,

616
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,963
getting excited,

617
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,193
the highway starts to,

618
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,168
pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow,
pow, pow,

619
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:32,897
and the drivers
start to fall off,

620
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,371
and then his penis boner
is the first thing

621
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,271
to penetrate
through the highway,

622
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:39,299
and she sees his body,
'cause she's like,

623
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,505
"l hope his body's
as good as his face",

624
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:42,604
and it is.

625
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,672
He is gorgeous,

626
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,742
just totally ripped,

627
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,880
and the boner's amazing,

628
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,288
and they live
happily ever after.

629
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:56,487
It's not
an amazing boner story.

630
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:57,756
It's romantic, though.

631
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,821
That's not romantic at all.

632
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,456
Boners breaking highways?
I mean-

633
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:05,401
That's what it's called.
-Jesus Christ.

634
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,233
So you don't have an ending?

635
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,206
You know, you tell me
to tell you a story,

636
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,400
so I tell you a story.

637
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:11,931
Then you don't like the ending.

638
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,103
Now I got to change the-
I mean, I'm not a writer, man.

639
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,476
I don't give a shit.

640
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:18,141
Robbie, maybe you're not
a writer of stories.

641
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,811
Maybe you are a writer
of poems.

642
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,251
I am not a writer of poems.

643
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,585
You know, poems are just
stories without endings.

644
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:27,489
It's not a fucking poem, okay?

645
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,856
Let's-come on, let's go.

646
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,224
It's time to get back
on the river.

647
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,320
Oh, yeah, right.

648
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,352
We're in no rush.

649
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:34,660
We got time.

650
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:38,494
Thank you, Jesus.

651
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,331
Robbie?

652
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,335
What do you think about Jesus?

653
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,441
We got to be
at that outpoint before 6:00.

654
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,850
Robbie?

655
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:58,048
Hey!

656
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,852
Where are you going?

657
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,051
What the heck?

658
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:04,084
We got to be at that outpoint
before 6:00.

659
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,652
What the heck, Robbie?

660
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,155
What happened to taking things
easy and slow?

661
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,100
What's the rush?

662
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,603
One more brew, Robbie.

663
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,471
One more brew!
One more brew!

664
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,906
One more brew!

665
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:20,308
Okay, look, look,
I'll have one.

666
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:21,972
I'll have one.

667
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,742
Two buds drinking brews.

668
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,476
Oh, it-

669
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,578
Awesome.

670
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:32,351
Yeah, party hearty.

671
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,823
Robbie!

672
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,985
You chug.

673
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,221
Chug party.

674
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,666
Yeah, yeah, Robbie!

675
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:46,863
Yeah, Robbie!

676
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,635
My turn.

677
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:53,166
Don't hurt yourself.

678
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,679
Whoo!

679
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,273
Oh, my!

680
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,305
Whoo!

681
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,045
We're doing it!

682
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,110
Mmm.

683
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:05,486
Mmm, mmm.

684
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:06,990
Oh.

685
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,357
Oh, I'm drinking my own pee.

686
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,790
Come on, all you boys.

687
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,128
I'm just a woman now.

688
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,396
I used to be a little girl,

689
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,096
but now I'm a woman, so...

690
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:23,767
# I'm a woman #

691
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,177
# Ho, ho, ho, ho,
ho, ho, ho, hosanna #

692
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,077
# Ho, hosanna #

693
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,014
# Ho,
hosanna #

694
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,449
# Ho, hosanna #

695
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,645
# I'm not a wo-oo-oman #

696
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:39,987
# I'm ho-hosanna,
ho-hosanna #

697
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,491
I got to take it easy.

698
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,026
Okay, come on.

699
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,726
Dance party.

700
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:55,734
I looooooove nature!

701
00:32:56,874 --> 00:33:00,071
I love nature.

702
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,875
Have you ever
been drunk before, Billy?

703
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,609
What the heck?

704
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,311
What the heck does it matter?

705
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,842
Because you're drunk now.

706
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,582
How many beers have you had?

707
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:12,611
I'm almost done.

708
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:14,919
That's the same one?

709
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,519
Mm, yeah.

710
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:18,688
You mad?

711
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,856
No.

712
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,660
- 'Cause you had to drink
18 dozen beers,

713
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:22,757
and I only have one

714
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,461
and then have
the time of my life?

715
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,491
God damn, l-

716
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,163
Sucks to be you.

717
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,174
Sucks to be you, Robbie.

718
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,473
Sucks to be you.

719
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,871
I've corrupted a priest.

720
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:40,248
Maybe I wanted to be
corrupted.

721
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,683
Don't wiggle your eyebrows
like that.

722
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:45,916
Why not?

723
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,481
It does not mean
what you think it does.

724
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,390
What do you think
that I think it means?

725
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,895
It's sexual, you know?

726
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:52,918
That's a come-on.

727
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:54,192
Do you want to come on to me?

728
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,696
Rock and roll!

729
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,260
Ah, son of a bitch.

730
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,999
Don't do that.

731
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,837
God damn it.

732
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,864
Don't do that.

733
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,837
You were so scared.

734
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:11,475
Oh.

735
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,074
Don't.

736
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,143
Are you gonna get sick?

737
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,786
You do not puke in this boat.

738
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:22,815
Do you hear me?

739
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,398
So do you have
a lot of groupies?

740
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,958
Man, there aren't
a lot of groupies

741
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,663
for a spotlight operator.

742
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,933
I'm with the crew.

743
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:37,202
We don't have groupies.

744
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,708
Tell me a groupie story.

745
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,108
What is it with
the stories, man?

746
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,133
I'm not a writer.

747
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,044
You were a writer.

748
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,447
You were a great one.

749
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:46,472
Why'd you stop?

750
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:47,506
Fuck you.

751
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,019
I-l-'cause I grew up.

752
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,042
That's why.

753
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,816
You just told a priest
to "fuck you."

754
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,169
You know what I feel like?

755
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:10,038
I feel like this could be like
Of Mice and Men,

756
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,133
where we just
pull over to the side.

757
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,077
I'd talk to you about rabbits,
get you all nice and calm,

758
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,082
put a gun against your head,
and bam!

759
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:22,314
I'd blow your brains
right out of your head.

760
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,151
You'd have to rape somebody
first, though, right?

761
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:26,247
Isn't that what Lenny does?

762
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,951
Doesn't he rape somebody?

763
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:38,792
All right, a groupie story.

764
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,997
Robbie meets a groupie, okay?

765
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:44,371
Groupie is sister
of the drummer.

766
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:46,740
Robbie gets groupie pregnant.

767
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:47,937
Robbie does the right thing.

768
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,776
Robbie proposes.

769
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,681
Then Robbie meets
another groupie

770
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,515
at this really shitty
little tour in Tulsa

771
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:59,114
for this Doug Henning
magic show.

772
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,852
Robbie confesses
to first groupie

773
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,019
about second groupie.

774
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,460
First groupie leaves Robbie.

775
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,930
Robbie sits in his house alone
for years.

776
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:10,058
Time passes.

777
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,762
Not very rock and roll.

778
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,400
So you've got kids?

779
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:19,875
Two.

780
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,105
Here.

781
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,208
Here's a picture.

782
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,913
Careful.

783
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:31,649
You got to add
seven years, though.

784
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,884
That-that was taken
awhile ago.

785
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:39,862
Cute?

786
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,023
They're all right.

787
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,996
Shouldn't we be seeing
the outpoint by now?

788
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,668
Do you think we missed it?

789
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,304
We didn't go
by a train trestle?

790
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,511
We passed a bridge, like,
an hour ago.

791
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,042
Are you fucking kidding me?

792
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,214
Yeah, but I don't think
we passed a train trestle.

793
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,918
A bridge
or a train trestle?

794
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,621
I don't know
what a train trestle is.

795
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,221
Shit.

796
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:17,030
A bridge is something that goes
over the river, all right?

797
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,161
A train trestle goes
over the river too,

798
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,693
but it has lots of supports,

799
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,104
'cause trains
are really fucking heavy.

800
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,368
Did it have lots of supports,

801
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,275
or was it just like,
a half a fucking donut hole?

802
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,977
I don't remember.

803
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:58,565
Man, we've been on this river
twice as long as that guy said.

804
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,736
I think we should keep going.

805
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,609
It's gonna be pitch-black

806
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,911
out here in 20 minutes,
you know.

807
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,143
We don't have flashlights.

808
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:11,018
Being on a river in the dark
is a bad idea.

809
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,421
You know, I got to be
out of here by 6:00

810
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,550
and on the road.

811
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:17,527
I cannot get stuck out here.

812
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,155
We are not
getting stuck out here.

813
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:21,289
Well, what do you want to do?

814
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,663
I want you to paddle.

815
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:35,409
We're not gonna spend
another fucking minute

816
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:36,572
in this boat, all right?

817
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:37,740
We're walking.

818
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:50,590
I don't even know
where we'd walk out of here.

819
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,062
Where the hell would we even
walk out of this place?

820
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,496
Maybe they'll send
a rescue boat.

821
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,521
Who?

822
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,931
The guy at the store.

823
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:01,631
Oh, yeah, the guy at the store
is gonna send a rescue boat.

824
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:02,696
I don't know.

825
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,766
All right, what do we have?

826
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,678
We got five beers
and some chicken tenders.

827
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,807
God damn.
God damn it.

828
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,250
No, don't say that.

829
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:18,653
We're gonna need
all the help we can get.

830
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,680
Robbie, I hope you're not
regretting this, 'cause-

831
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:23,319
I don't remember you, okay?

832
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,693
I don't remember you at all.

833
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,460
What-what-what do you mean
you don't remember me?

834
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,764
What I mean is,
I don't remember you, okay?

835
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:34,896
How exactly do we
know each other anyway, huh?

836
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,372
You were over at my house.

837
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,034
Where's your house?

838
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,838
Where's your fucking house?

839
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,935
Why would I be there?

840
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,912
You know all this shit about me.

841
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:43,936
How do you know it?

842
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,846
Why?

843
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,350
Because you were dating
my sister.

844
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,852
Who's your sister?

845
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,751
Who's your fucking sister?

846
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:55,189
My sister is
Janice Smoortser.

847
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,818
Janice Smoortser.

848
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,758
Janice Smoortser
had a brother.

849
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,892
Dude, there were so many girls,

850
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:08,905
which means a lot
of little brothers, okay,

851
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:12,898
a lot of little sisters,
a lot of moms, a lot of dads.

852
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:16,435
It was a long time ago,
all right?

853
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,243
I'm sorry.

854
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,476
You really don't remember me?

855
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:22,748
No, I do not, like, at all.

856
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:25,381
Then why did you come here?

857
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,721
Because you
were relentless, man.

858
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:28,816
You were relentless.

859
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,383
You fucking hammered me,

860
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,952
and you sent me a picture of you

861
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,624
Iooking like a sap ass
just like now

862
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,223
with your little priest collar,

863
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,393
and who am l?

864
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,062
Who am I to say no to a priest?

865
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,800
I think you sent me
50 to 75 emails.

866
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,139
You fucking hammered
and hammered and hammered me,

867
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:49,704
and you get to a point
where you wear somebody down.

868
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,647
I fucking gave up,
and I showed up.

869
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:52,671
Do you know what else?

870
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,445
I don't have anything!

871
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,180
I have nothing in my life!

872
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,189
I have nothing better to do
but sit here with you,

873
00:40:59,223 --> 00:41:00,656
you fucking dork.

874
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:03,387
So I'm out here in the woods
with Father Doofus

875
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:04,792
when I should be at work,

876
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,626
and I'm probably
gonna get fired.

877
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:12,700
Janice Smoortser.

878
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:13,725
Jesus Christ.

879
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,136
Gimme that.

880
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:17,965
That's great.

881
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,498
You know,
we could've used a fire.

882
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,204
That was really stupid.

883
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,406
You were my hero.

884
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,039
I looked up to you.

885
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,606
I read your stories.

886
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,777
I told your stories.

887
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,286
All right, Father Billy-

888
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,447
Hey, hey, hey!

889
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,719
Father Billy is for my friends.

890
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,918
You can call me Father William.

891
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,121
Father Will-yam.

892
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,231
God, you're an asshole.

893
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,360
Huh?

894
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,391
Do you like this?

895
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,995
Do you like your
fucking chicken tender?

896
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,027
Don't throw my-

897
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,335
You don't like them?

898
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:53,036
Don't throw my-
I'll throw your beer.

899
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,977
Fuck you.

900
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,502
Why are you doing this?

901
00:41:56,547 --> 00:42:00,381
I invited you out here,
and then you come here.

902
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,681
You were my guest,

903
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,711
and then you just use
your blasphemy

904
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:07,087
and seduction techniques on me.

905
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,149
No, no, I didn't seduce you.

906
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,162
You made jokes
about raping me.

907
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,857
That was Of Mice and Men.

908
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,093
It's a fucking
John Steinbeck joke.

909
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,862
Are you retarded?

910
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:23,135
I don't care
about John Stein-buck!

911
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:26,472
There was no train trestle,
was there?

912
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,536
This is all a part of your plot,
wasn't it?

913
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,138
Dude, you're insane.
-You're insane.

914
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,944
You-you invited me.

915
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,473
Don't!
Stop it!

916
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:37,146
We're gonna be out here
all night in the cold

917
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,815
with no fucking-
is that the last one?

918
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,085
This is the last beer.

919
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,889
I suggest you take that beer,
and you drink it.

920
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,828
Billy, I'm telling you,
god damn it.

921
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,797
Don't you fucking do that.

922
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,298
Don't do it, Billy.
-I'm gonna.

923
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,198
No, we're gonna be out here
in the cold.

924
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,600
We're gonna want that.

925
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,695
Billy, Billy,
Billy, Billy, Billy!

926
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,932
What? What?
What? What? What?

927
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:56,940
Don't do it.
Don't do it.

928
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,168
What? What?
What? What? What?

929
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,334
What do you want me to say?

930
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:00,673
You want me to tell you
I'm sorry?

931
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:01,939
I'm sorry.

932
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,537
You want me to tell you
it got out of hand?

933
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,548
It got out of fucking hand.

934
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,708
Listen to me, okay?

935
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,683
I am sorry,
but we should sit down,

936
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:10,846
and we should split that, okay?

937
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:12,913
Let me-
let me have that.

938
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:22,189
Okay, all right.

939
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:25,724
Man, if it makes you
feel any better...

940
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,431
You're the only one who ever
gave a shit about those stories.

941
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:30,030
I didn't even know
anybody ever read 'em.

942
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:33,339
You're the only one
who ever listened to my music.

943
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,311
Do you know what we need to do?

944
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:36,938
We need to sit here.

945
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,539
We need to get through
the night.

946
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:43,110
Then I go back to work,
you go back to work, okay?

947
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,882
Let's just sit down,
and let's chill out.

948
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,220
This is stupid, okay?

949
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,939
Were you in love
with my sister?

950
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,443
Not really, Billy.

951
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,506
Not at all.

952
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:43,108
It's a rescue boat!

953
00:44:43,147 --> 00:44:45,547
Oh, hey, hey!

954
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,675
Hey!

955
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:49,151
Hey!

956
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:53,384
Where are the railroad tracks?

957
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,824
There are no railroad tracks,
ladies.

958
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,918
Can we camp with you?

959
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:58,950
Yes.

960
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:00,429
We have lots of food.

961
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,927
Please.

962
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:15,907
This is awesome.

963
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:18,176
What the heck is going on?

964
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,012
Dude, they're beautiful.

965
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:25,877
Please.

966
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,220
Oh, gracias.

967
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,254
What is it?

968
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:34,457
Please.

969
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:35,487
Oh, thank you.

970
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:36,829
Thank you very much.
-Very good.

971
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:38,630
Please, thank you.
-I don't really eat this.

972
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:39,658
Please.
-Please.

973
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:40,692
Please?

974
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,865
This is delicious.

975
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,602
What is in this thing?

976
00:45:45,642 --> 00:45:46,734
Plea-please.

977
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:50,907
It's like eyes and skin.

978
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,506
I ate a tooth.

979
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,141
Are we gonna have dessert?

980
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:58,614
I could just hold for dessert
and not eat this.

981
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,987
You are dessert.

982
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,013
I am dessert?

983
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,219
Yeah.

984
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:06,325
Yes, very good.

985
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:08,957
Mm-hmm, that's delicious.

986
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:11,723
Oda-ma-
what is it?

987
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,307
Odamaida.

988
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,809
What was that?

989
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:25,610
Jim.
-Jim?

990
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:26,638
Your name is Jim?

991
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,344
Hai.

992
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:32,378
Huckleberry Finn desu,
Tom Sawyer desu,

993
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,582
Jim desu.

994
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,455
Huckleberry Finn.
-Hai.

995
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:37,983
Tom Sawyer.
-Hai.

996
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:39,586
Jim-dess.
-Oh, I get it.

997
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,157
We take Jim to freedom.

998
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,636
We take him Mississippi River.

999
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,763
You take Jim to freedom?

1000
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,205
Freedom!

1001
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,332
That's nice of you, I guess.

1002
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,309
Big black freedom.

1003
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:56,904
Very sad big black man.

1004
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,380
Very, very sad.

1005
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:02,909
We take to freedom,
make him happy.

1006
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,511
Happy.
-Happy.

1007
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:05,749
So where are you from?

1008
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:07,450
Where are you-
where are you guys all from?

1009
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,652
Uh, sorry.

1010
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:10,682
Oh, okay.

1011
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,059
Where did you come from to here?

1012
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:15,690
Hmm, sorry.

1013
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:17,290
Did you come from Tokyo?

1014
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:25,600
I think what he's trying
to say is, where are you from?

1015
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:26,631
Yes.

1016
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,508
Where are you from?

1017
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:31,070
Yes, yes,
where are you from?

1018
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,741
Dude, ask-ask Jim.

1019
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:33,772
Ask Jim.

1020
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:34,806
You ask Jim.

1021
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,319
Ask him.

1022
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,513
Ask Jim.
-Yeah.

1023
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:39,419
Jim-chan.

1024
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,083
It's not that important.

1025
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,113
Ask him.

1026
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:45,128
Just ask him.
-Jim?

1027
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,221
Where are you from?

1028
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,024
I don't think he heard you.

1029
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:51,056
Ask him louder.

1030
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:52,693
I knew-

1031
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:54,863
Jim, where are you from?

1032
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,006
See, I told you
he wasn't gonna tell us.

1033
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:08,279
Tom Sawyer would like to know
if she can kiss you.

1034
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,307
Oh, yeah.

1035
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:10,342
No, l-

1036
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,854
Wait, she would like to
give me a kiss?

1037
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,878
Yes.

1038
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:13,912
No, I'm a priest, so-

1039
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:14,946
I'm a priest.

1040
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,421
She says it's okay.

1041
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,330
No, it's not, it's not-

1042
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,891
Panda kiss.

1043
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,197
No.
-Please.

1044
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,067
You are very cute.

1045
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,970
No.

1046
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,907
Hey, Tom Sawyer.

1047
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,034
I'll give you a kiss.

1048
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,475
No!

1049
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,487
Lucky dog.

1050
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:50,652
Wow.

1051
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,996
Now, please, campfire story.

1052
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:58,501
Campfire story?

1053
00:48:58,535 --> 00:48:59,524
Yes, please.

1054
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:00,763
Japanese custom.

1055
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,499
There's the greatest
campfire story man

1056
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:03,528
in the world right there.

1057
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:04,631
You tell 'em a story.

1058
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:05,937
They gave you a kiss.

1059
00:49:05,976 --> 00:49:08,274
Get a-get a story
from cute boy.

1060
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:10,041
Robbie, don't be shy.

1061
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,707
Tell us a campfire story.

1062
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,238
Don't be shy!

1063
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,443
I can't think of one.

1064
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:15,473
Please!

1065
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,986
Robbie.

1066
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,009
I don't-I don't have-

1067
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,181
Robbie.
-Robbie.

1068
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:20,348
I don't have another story.

1069
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,584
You've got to.

1070
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,422
You got to.

1071
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,758
Robbie!
-Robbie!

1072
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:26,820
Robbie!

1073
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:27,852
Campfire story.

1074
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:30,128
Robbie!
Robbie!

1075
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,191
Campfire story.

1076
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,531
All right, you guys
want a story?

1077
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:33,558
Story.

1078
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,662
You want one?
-Yeah.

1079
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:36,866
All right.

1080
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,841
This is one I've never told you.
-Ooh.

1081
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:42,572
I don't think you've ever
heard this one before.

1082
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,137
This one is about
the depressed businessman.

1083
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,085
This guy was
at the end of his rope.

1084
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,146
His life was horrible.

1085
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:54,623
He never married.

1086
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,627
His parents were both killed
in a tragic accident,

1087
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,630
so he'd been alone
most of his life.

1088
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,360
He lost every cent he ever had.

1089
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,391
He had put it all into
the stock market,

1090
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:07,596
and he lost it.

1091
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:16,871
Oh.
-Oh.

1092
00:50:16,913 --> 00:50:21,077
And now-now he had had
this enormous business deal,

1093
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,517
and he screwed it up,

1094
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:25,578
and this was gonna be the one
that brought him back,

1095
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:26,611
and he blew that.

1096
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,021
If he had no money,

1097
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:30,492
how was he gonna be involved
in a business deal?

1098
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,085
He was using credit cards.

1099
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:33,756
He was doing it
on credit cards?

1100
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,128
He was
doing it on credit cards.

1101
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,530
You should never do that.

1102
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:37,897
So anyway...

1103
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:46,669
Now, just to say, okay,

1104
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,907
he'd been contemplating this
for a very long time.

1105
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:52,210
This was not a rash decision,
okay?

1106
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:53,409
This guy was in dire straits.

1107
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:54,610
He was ready.

1108
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:58,280
He was prepared
to leave this world.

1109
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,660
This was it.

1110
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:13,430
This was his end.

1111
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,733
Click, nothing.

1112
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,336
Nothing at all.

1113
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,042
He takes the gun and just-
just on a whim,

1114
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,482
he aims it towards the wall.

1115
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:29,849
This time, it goes off.

1116
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:31,547
There's a couple next door
making love,

1117
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,919
and he shot the woman.

1118
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:34,753
Killed her, right?

1119
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,281
And so the guy
looks through the hole

1120
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:37,623
that the bullet went through.

1121
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:39,788
He just said,
"Dude, you just shot my woman!

1122
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:42,390
What are you,
out of your mind? "

1123
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,526
He was so bereft from this,
click, nothing.

1124
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:52,468
Now, by this time, the guy
had come out of the hotel room.

1125
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:53,703
He was knocking on the door.

1126
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:55,267
He was like,
"Dude, you open the door! "

1127
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:05,814
He aimed it
towards the door.

1128
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,202
The cops are coming, okay?

1129
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,834
Because the body count is being
racked up at the hotel,

1130
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,434
and it's coming quick.

1131
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,877
But wait, wait, one more thing
I've got to interject, though.

1132
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:34,407
This guy is a total pacifist,
okay?

1133
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:38,512
He's never harmed or hurt
anybody in his entire life.

1134
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:41,115
He's a member
of the Nature Conservancy

1135
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,420
for Christ's sake, right?

1136
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:46,828
And here he was
prepared to meet his maker,

1137
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:50,731
and in the last seconds
of his life,

1138
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:55,568
this gentle soul
becomes a murderer, right?

1139
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,072
And so, cut back.

1140
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,727
And so he knows
what's gonna happen.

1141
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:26,963
He can go out there,

1142
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,300
and the police
will blow him away.

1143
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:29,430
The police will do it for him.

1144
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:31,201
He opens up the door.

1145
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,402
All the police were out there.

1146
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,411
He gets ready.

1147
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:37,572
Bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam! Bam!

1148
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:40,276
He fires 'em all out there,

1149
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:42,547
and then he gets ready
and leans back,

1150
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:43,951
and he's ready to just be

1151
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:46,217
riddled with bullets
by the cops.

1152
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,256
Nothing.
Nothing.

1153
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:55,526
All he hears,
two dozen guns misfiring.

1154
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:58,329
Tck, tck, tck,
tck, tck, tck, tck.

1155
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,503
No relief.

1156
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:08,341
Not one bullet fired.

1157
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,723
Right?

1158
00:54:26,296 --> 00:54:28,321
See, they got it.
They got it.

1159
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:33,563
What is, uh, ending?

1160
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:35,627
Oh, god damn it.

1161
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:36,661
That is the ending.

1162
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:37,968
That's-that's it.

1163
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:38,997
That's the ending.

1164
00:54:42,345 --> 00:54:43,403
What?

1165
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,435
Bad.

1166
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:45,846
Boo-boo, boo.

1167
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,315
Bad?
-Bad.

1168
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,716
Bad story?

1169
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:50,742
We don't like it.

1170
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,516
The whole story, no?

1171
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:53,749
Hm.

1172
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:54,779
No.
-No.

1173
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,257
No good.
-No good.

1174
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,760
Bad ending.

1175
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,625
Bad!

1176
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:01,392
I like it.

1177
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,922
Thank you, Billy.

1178
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,059
You don't like the ending?

1179
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:06,090
No.

1180
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,467
No ending.

1181
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:08,664
No like ending.

1182
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:09,694
You liked the beginning?

1183
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:10,728
Hmm.

1184
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,867
So-so.

1185
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,537
Well, I hate to
poo-poo this party,

1186
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:17,876
but someone has got to pee-pee.

1187
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:20,681
Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

1188
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,082
Bye-bye, be careful.

1189
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,303
Father?
-Ah!

1190
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,279
Don't!
Don't do that.

1191
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:54,010
Don't sneak up on somebody
while they're urinating.

1192
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,381
I'm sorry, Father.

1193
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:58,216
Please, I'm having
a private moment here.

1194
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:01,417
Would you please honor that
and give me some space?

1195
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,120
Oh, jeez.

1196
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,957
Thank you.

1197
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,999
It might be a moment.

1198
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,331
I had a few brewskies.

1199
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,860
Whoo!

1200
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:18,203
I don't think
I've ever peed this much.

1201
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:20,539
I guess this multiplies
in your stomach.

1202
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:24,274
Is that what it does, beer?

1203
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,975
Does beer multiply
in your stomach?

1204
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:28,176
Do you-

1205
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,685
You don't talk much.

1206
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:33,349
Ah, okay.

1207
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,379
Almost done.

1208
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:36,187
Ah.

1209
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:41,120
I guess you can't wash
your hands anywhere out here.

1210
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:42,825
Father, I need to
speak with you.

1211
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,026
Okay.

1212
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,659
Do you want to talk
in the bathroom, or-

1213
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:47,363
I need to make a confession.

1214
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,735
Um, okay.

1215
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,137
I guess
you're not Japanese, huh?

1216
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:53,734
Look, I did
something horrible.

1217
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,439
I need forgiveness for it,
Father.

1218
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:57,946
What did you do?

1219
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:05,187
You know that guy,
that Father Billy?

1220
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,355
I've known him
since ninth grade.

1221
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,687
He was my only fan.

1222
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,164
You guys,
he sent me a fan letter.

1223
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:19,600
That guy, he knew every song
that I'd ever wrote.

1224
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:23,970
He remembered stories
that I read back then.

1225
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,676
He's a good guy.

1226
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:35,945
What is that?

1227
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,717
Hey.

1228
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:43,021
Can I have some?

1229
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:49,361
This make you stop,
uh, talking.

1230
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:51,591
Thank you.

1231
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,363
Hai.
-Hai.

1232
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:55,428
Whoa.

1233
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,235
It makes your mouth numb.

1234
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:03,610
Why Billy friends
with someone like you?

1235
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:09,174
We don't know either.

1236
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,952
Oh, God, please.

1237
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:19,291
Look, Father,
I'm not a bad man.

1238
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,489
It wasn't my fault.

1239
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,794
They made me do it.

1240
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,356
Jim, this is weird.

1241
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,958
We look weird back here.

1242
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,367
Please get up.

1243
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:29,871
No, we went to church, man.

1244
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:32,670
I always took communion.

1245
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:34,768
Jim, I don't want the girls
to see us like this.

1246
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:36,870
It isn't something
I planned.

1247
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:38,278
It just happened.

1248
00:58:38,314 --> 00:58:41,078
Please forgive me.

1249
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:44,848
Jim, the Lord forgives you.

1250
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:46,321
It's just that,

1251
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:49,723
I think we might be
in my pee puddle right now.

1252
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,589
Okay.

1253
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:53,721
Jim, let's go.

1254
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:58,097
Oh, okay, okay,
there you go.

1255
00:58:58,134 --> 00:58:59,123
Oh.

1256
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:04,536
So is your name Jim?

1257
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:10,972
What is it?

1258
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:12,242
Tim.

1259
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,611
Tim.

1260
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,917
Is that short for Timothy?

1261
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:19,944
Yes.

1262
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:22,116
Oh, I'm sorry.

1263
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:37,638
Hey, whoa, we got a show
starting here.

1264
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,505
What is this?
-I don't know.

1265
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:41,100
Is this, like, a concert
or something?

1266
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,270
I don't know.

1267
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,870
This is about the only thing

1268
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,143
that could've taken my mind off
of what just happened.

1269
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:47,547
You got to try this.

1270
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,983
I just peed,

1271
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,349
and I don't want to
drink anymore.

1272
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:51,910
No, this is part of
the whole deal.

1273
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:53,217
Don't be rude, right?

1274
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,850
This is part of the whole thing?

1275
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:57,223
Kanpai!

1276
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,659
Kanpai!

1277
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:01,829
Oh, that was good.

1278
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:04,264
It does something weird
to your mouth too.

1279
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,632
Aren't you glad you came out?
-Yes.

1280
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:08,136
This is one of the best days
of my life,

1281
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:09,468
I have a feeling.

1282
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:11,564
I know you took a long time
to answer my emails.

1283
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,597
Wasn't this worth it?

1284
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:14,007
Yes.

1285
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:16,204
And let me be the first to
apologize for not answering.

1286
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:17,906
Apology accepted.

1287
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,849
Is this a show?

1288
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,116
Whoa,
how come I can hear him?

1289
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:29,351
What is this thing?

1290
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,451
Is this-this is more than
a boom box.

1291
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,588
This is freaky.

1292
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,826
Whoa!

1293
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:39,232
Your voice sounds so weird.

1294
01:00:39,268 --> 01:00:40,701
Say something to me.

1295
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:43,205
I slit a sheet.

1296
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,730
The sheet I slit.

1297
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:49,643
Upon this slitted sheet I sit.

1298
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:52,204
A slitted sheet,
I slit.

1299
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:54,079
Whoa, weird.

1300
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,517
Why aren't they looking at us?

1301
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:57,849
Hey!

1302
01:00:57,887 --> 01:00:59,411
These feel warm.

1303
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:00,683
These feel like-

1304
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:02,418
Iike they're making my head
a little fuzzy.

1305
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:03,425
Is that right?

1306
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:05,222
Why are your eyes closed?

1307
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,202
Oh.

1308
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:23,438
Do you hear that?

1309
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:26,312
God, it's beautiful.

1310
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,976
Did you make this music?

1311
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,432
I can't hear you.

1312
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:49,962
You're trying to talk,
but I can't hear you.

1313
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:55,740
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

1314
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:57,541
I can't hear you.

1315
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,604
Shh!

1316
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,027
It's a little too loud.

1317
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:24,862
Is yours too loud?

1318
01:02:26,609 --> 01:02:28,076
Is yours too loud?

1319
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,576
Are you okay?

1320
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:37,051
You don't look good.

1321
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:39,111
No, it's okay.

1322
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:40,520
I just-

1323
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,318
Yeah, maybe it's a little loud.

1324
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,056
Maybe it-maybe the music's
a little loud.

1325
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,961
Guys, can you turn it down?

1326
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:54,836
Hey, knock it off!

1327
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:57,928
Is this glue?

1328
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,874
Do you have glue
on this fucking thing?

1329
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:02,635
Look at him, he's hurt!

1330
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:04,373
Shut it off.

1331
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:05,744
Robbie!

1332
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,339
Robbie!

1333
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:09,715
Billy?

1334
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:11,413
It's like it's
drilling between my eyes.

1335
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,443
Tell them to stop it.

1336
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:13,716
Turn it off!
Look at Robbie!

1337
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:18,626
That's so fucking loud!

1338
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:21,994
Stop it!
Stop it!

1339
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:48,888
Robbie!

1340
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:56,759
Robbie?

1341
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,393
Robbie!
Robbie!

1342
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:09,171
Judas Priest!

1343
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:13,697
Robbie?

1344
01:05:15,878 --> 01:05:17,470
Robbie?

1345
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,174
You okay?

1346
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,513
Robbie?

1347
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,725
Robbie?

1348
01:05:36,198 --> 01:05:37,665
Robbie?

1349
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:40,166
Robbie?

1350
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,005
Oh.

1351
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,303
Oh, lordy.

1352
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,641
Robbie.

1353
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,147
His head blew off.

1354
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:56,781
Robbie?

1355
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:00,950
Robbie?

1356
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:31,876
- # Do not I love Thee,
O my Lord? #

1357
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:39,453
# Behold my heart and see #

1358
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:47,527
# And turn
each cursed idol out #

1359
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:55,067
# That dares to rival Thee #

1360
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:01,879
You're going home, Robbie.

1361
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,391
Robbie?

1362
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:48,056
You got to help me, Robbie.

1363
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:50,258
I don't know
how to steer this thing.

1364
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:55,861
Can anybody help me
steer this thing?

1365
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:01,901
Does anybody know
how a canoe works?

1366
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:06,874
Who's gonna help me, Robbie?

1367
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:14,947
Oh, my God.

1368
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,185
Who's gonna help me now?

1369
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:27,995
Oh, God.

1370
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:34,374
Dear Lord, this has been
the suckiest trip for me ever.

1371
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:38,904
I don't know why you're
screwing with me so bad,

1372
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,143
but if you want to be friends,

1373
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:46,086
then please, help me get
back to the church safe.

1374
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:51,486
I know you work
in mysterious ways,

1375
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:54,690
so if your ways are gonna get
any more mysterious,

1376
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:58,166
please let that happen now.

1377
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,792
Thank you.

1378
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:01,268
Amen.

1379
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,337
Ro-Robbie!

1380
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:12,745
Robbie!
Robbie!

1381
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,511
Robbie!

1382
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,348
It's me, your buddy.

1383
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,518
Robbie.

1384
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:29,762
Robbie?

1385
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:30,958
No.

1386
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:38,668
Robbie.

1387
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:52,815
Robbie Shoemaker.

1388
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:55,847
You were the coolest dude ever.

1389
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,760
Regardless of what you
thought of me

1390
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:05,893
or what you did
to my sister's body,

1391
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:09,735
I hope that you find peace now.

1392
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:38,516
Who's there?

1393
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,357
You want to fight, birds?

1394
01:11:43,499 --> 01:11:44,761
What do you want?

1395
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:48,430
What do you want?

1396
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:08,857
Help!

1397
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:10,290
Give me a ride!

1398
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,157
Help! Stop!

1399
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:13,991
Let me in.

1400
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:15,291
You don't understand!

1401
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:18,562
I sent Robbie an email,
and then he responded,

1402
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,999
and then we went together.

1403
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:22,833
It was my idea to go canoeing.

1404
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:26,637
It was my idea,
but it was a bad idea,

1405
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:30,975
because then his head,
it exploded.

1406
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:35,279
The Japanese girls,
they made his head explode,

1407
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:37,683
and it was not my fault.

1408
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,119
It was not my fault,

1409
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:41,679
but they did,
and it got all over me,

1410
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:44,989
and then I ran
till I couldn't run,

1411
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,928
and then the birds came in
and-and I said,

1412
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,362
"What are you doing?"'

1413
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:50,797
And then I got-

1414
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:54,394
and then I fought that man,
and I kicked him.

1415
01:12:54,436 --> 01:12:55,425
I'm begging you, please.

1416
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:56,836
All right, hey,
just get in.

1417
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:06,905
Aw.

1418
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:17,181
Aw.

1419
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:35,134
- # Oh, sinner, do not stray #

1420
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:37,270
# From the straight
and narrow way #

1421
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:41,806
# For the Lord is surely
watching what you do #

1422
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:45,047
# lf you approach
the devil's den #

1423
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,918
# Turn round,
don't enter in #

1424
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:51,722
# Lest the hand of the Almighty
fall on you #

1425
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,388
# He'll fuck you up #

1426
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,762
# Yes, God will fuck you up #

1427
01:13:56,799 --> 01:14:01,293
# If you dare to disobey
his stern command #

1428
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,861
# He'll fuck you up #

1429
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:06,397
# Don't you know
he'll fuck you up #

1430
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:11,072
# So you better do some praying
while you can #

1431
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,513
# Long ago a man named Lot #

1432
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:15,949
# Had a wife
he thought was hot #

1433
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:20,478
# But she could not stop
her black and sinful ways #

1434
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:23,116
# You know it was
her own damn fault #

1435
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:25,524
# When God turned that bitch
to salt #

1436
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:30,089
# That's the way he used to
work back in those days #

1437
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,794
# He fucked 'em up #

1438
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:35,099
# He really fucked 'em up #

1439
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:39,574
# When the people went
and turned their backs on him #

1440
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:42,338
# He can fuck you up #

1441
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:44,971
# No shit,
he'll fuck you up #

1442
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:48,915
# Just like he fucked
the people up back then #

1443
01:14:56,525 --> 01:15:00,393
It's a sad story,
ultimately,

1444
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:05,662
a tragedy,
perhaps, uh...

1445
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:09,660
a little out there.

1446
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:14,369
But I'm not sure
I'm understanding what, uh...

1447
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,174
I mean, it-

1448
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:23,048
Well, I think
it's a love story.

1449
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:24,677
Yes?

1450
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,914
Yes, sure.

1451
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:28,855
But-but-
but I'm just not positive.

1452
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:31,416
If he's totally surrounded
by concrete,

1453
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,621
just stuck inside
this concrete pillar,

1454
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:38,065
then where else
can the story go?

1455
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:40,432
I-I just wondered.

1456
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:43,199
Um, is it hopeless?

1457
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:47,231
Well, this was
a wonderful discussion.

1458
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:50,768
I think we should pick up
where we left off next week.

1459
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:54,976
We should go home
and think about this some more,

1460
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:57,542
really, really think about it.

1461
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:02,053
Okay,
I'll see you all next week.

1462
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:06,083
In the name of the Father, Son,
Holy Spirit, amen.

1463
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:08,255
And next week, I'll share
with you a new parable

1464
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:11,892
about a businessman
at the end of his rope.

1465
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:15,335
All right,
have a great weekend, everybody.

1466
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:16,803
It's really nice.

1467
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:18,328
Thank you, Father.
-Oh, thank you.

1468
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:20,432
I really did feel you
hitting on something there.

1469
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:21,840
Oh, thank you.

1470
01:16:21,877 --> 01:16:22,969
Very inspirational.

1471
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,842
Thank you.

1472
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:34,219
They seem to be very pensive
this week, Father.

1473
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,224
I'm hearing some good things.

1474
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,920
Yes, we're having
some great discussions.

1475
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:40,292
I'm proud of you, my son.

1476
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:43,162
You've come a long way
in a short amount of time.

1477
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:46,031
I think that the vacation did
you some good, wouldn't you say?

1478
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:47,763
I think so.

1479
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:50,294
Oh, by the way,
these-these came for you.

1480
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:51,806
They were in my box.

1481
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,740
Oh.
Thank you, Father.

1482
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:54,901
You're welcome.

1483
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:57,741
It's good to see you,
Father William,

1484
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:01,374
young and strong and healthy.

1485
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:03,714
Blessed be the saints.

1486
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:32,172
Father, could I see you
over here for a minute, please?

1487
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,234
