1
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:07,541
( metal rasping )

2
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:36,170
( footsteps )

3
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,502
( dance music playing )

4
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,383
Let's go.

5
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,187
Come on.

6
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,919
Come on.

7
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,876
( moaning )

8
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,979
Oh, my God. Oh.

9
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:11,819
( moaning )

10
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:15,789
Oh, yeah.

11
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,992
( laughs, screams )

12
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:21,395
( grunting, coughing )

13
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,935
( gasps )

14
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,937
( sighs )

15
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,655
Did I tell you about this babe Lucinda,

16
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:22,990
does the lunch shift with me?

17
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,725
No.

18
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:28,629
Oh man, she is something else.

19
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,432
I tell you, Costello, the minute I saw her,

20
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,535
I knew I had to bag her.

21
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:39,039
Look, Nick,

22
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,709
we're here to get a liberal arts education.

23
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:44,845
That means absorbing the collective wisdom

24
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,382
of centuries of Western civilization.

25
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,351
There's a lot more to life than
just bagging babes, you know?

26
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,788
Yeah, anyway, like I was saying,

27
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:58,826
yesterday I came close... I mean real close.

28
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,795
But unfortunately close
doesn't count in this league,

29
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:04,598
so that's why I was wondering if,

30
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,366
you know, you'd help me out.

31
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:09,537
Forget it.

32
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,540
Come on, Costello.

33
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:16,076
No. N-O means no. I'm sorry.

34
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,946
This is hers, okay?

35
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,648
She uses it to wipe tables.

36
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,683
It'll take 30 seconds of your time.

37
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,989
- ( TV playing )
- Come on, Costello, what do you say?

38
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,825
<i>The body was found this morning.</i>

39
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,595
<i>The city coroner reports
that the murder took place...</i>

40
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,498
- Are you even listening to me?
- Shh, I wanna hear this.

41
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,032
<i>...and it was preceded by sexual assault.</i>

42
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,901
<i>In response to a News 12 reporter's question,</i>

43
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,571
<i>police spokesman Lieutenant Adam Markowitz</i>

44
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,105
<i>has denied that this is in any way related</i>

45
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,576
<i>to the recent killings which
have plagued the West Side.</i>

46
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,778
<i>Police have positively identified the body</i>

47
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,880
<i>as 20-year-old Suzanne Smyth.</i>

48
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,815
<i>And now to the nation's capital.</i>

49
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,984
<i>The Senate Appropriations Committee will be...</i>

50
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,920
( imitates radio static )
Earth to Costello, come in.

51
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:02,823
- Do you read me?
- Shit, I'm gonna be late.

52
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:06,594
( sighs )

53
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:09,129
( thunder rumbles )

54
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,471
( horn honking )

55
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,662
So for those of you who didn't get one,

56
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:44,598
you can pick up a list of term
paper topics in my office.

57
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,902
( class laughs )

58
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,106
Are you all right, Mister...

59
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,010
Costello. Yeah, thanks. I'm fine.

60
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,917
Term papers in your office. I heard.

61
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,887
So as promised,

62
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,857
- we have a distinguished guest lecturer today.
- ( pen clatters )

63
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,925
He's a research fellow here on campus

64
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,927
and a leading authority in the field

65
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,963
of abnormal psychology.

66
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:19,533
His latest book is <i>Rage and Redemption.</i>

67
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:22,035
You can pick this up at the campus bookstore.

68
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:25,873
I'm speaking, of course, of Dr. Theodore Steering.

69
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,008
( applause, cheering )

70
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,115
Thank you.

71
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:37,050
The other day I came across

72
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:40,921
a widely-accepted definition of
"psychosis" as being, and I quote,

73
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,924
"a mental disorder affecting
the entire personality

74
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,859
with certain characteristics

75
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:48,295
common to all psychotic conditions,

76
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:53,767
namely the inability to perform daily activities,

77
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:56,937
delusion, stupor and/or incoherence

78
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,106
and ultimately,

79
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,275
in worst-case scenarios,
self-destructive behavior."

80
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:07,915
Well, what struck me about this definition

81
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,884
is that it applies to most of the
students and faculty that I know.

82
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,320
( laughter )

83
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,897
Uh, excuse me, Miss Young?

84
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:26,199
- Mr. Costello.
- That's right. Patrick Costello.

85
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,101
And your first name's Laurel, isn't it?

86
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,370
Can I help you with something, Mr. Costello?

87
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,306
Well, actually I just had a couple
of questions I wanted to ask you.

88
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,308
- About your term paper?
- Not exactly.

89
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,111
- As a matter of fact, not at all.
- About your lecture notes?

90
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,648
Those are some very comprehensive lecture notes.

91
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,616
Well, I used to be an art major.

92
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,918
Is that what you wanted to ask me about... art?

93
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:47,387
No. Actually I wanted to know if
you wanted to grab some lunch.

94
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,023
- Uh, I don't think so.
- How about dinner then?

95
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:52,325
- Say 8:00-ish.
- I'm afraid that's impossible.

96
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,327
Why? Are you married? I mean we're both creative.

97
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:57,397
I'm sure we can come up
with some kind of solution.

98
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,000
You may not be aware, Mr. Costello,

99
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,903
but the University has very strict guidelines

100
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:06,073
governing the social relations
between faculty and students.

101
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,340
Oh no, I'm aware, all right.

102
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,209
You're probably wondering, since I am aware

103
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,878
of these antiquated and mostly likely

104
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,846
unconstitutional guidelines and rules,

105
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,147
you're probably wondering why I persist.

106
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,949
I mean, what's the point really?

107
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:18,819
I'm sorry, Mr. Costello, but I meant what I said.

108
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,822
They may be antiquated. They may be outmoded,

109
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,291
- but I play by the rules.
- Wait a second.

110
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,994
You're really serious, right?
You're not just pulling my leg?

111
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,128
I mean you really mean this?

112
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:31,932
I'm really serious about a lot of
things, Mr. Costello.

113
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:53,987
( police radio chatter )

114
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:57,024
( sirens blaring in distance )

115
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,994
Right over there.

116
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:04,031
( indistinct chatter )

117
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:11,071
( camera clicking )

118
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,976
Hmm.

119
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,259
- ( phone ringing )
- Adam: Looks like he's killing them with a belt

120
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,361
and the buckle leaves an impression on the neck.

121
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,730
Yeah, no kidding.

122
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:15,769
It's... it's a bug.

123
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,871
That's a weird-looking bug.

124
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,473
Sure is.

125
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,177
White Oldsmobile.

126
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,853
( sighs )

127
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,889
Gray Mazda.

128
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,962
Pontiac. Shit.

129
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:45,999
- Well, it was gray anyway.
- ( imitating car engine )

130
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,938
Whew hoo, boy.

131
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:53,206
Drinking beers and guessing cars.

132
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,108
Man, you know how to live.

133
00:12:55,142 --> 00:13:00,013
( laughs ) So what did the
teaching assistant have to say?

134
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:03,884
University guidelines don’t
allow faculty to date students.

135
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:07,054
Oh, you know,
I've heard some turn-downs in my time,

136
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:10,123
and in fact I consider myself
somewhat of an expert on the subject,

137
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,125
but I've never heard one that stupid.

138
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,061
Wait.

139
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:16,063
Dusty blue Van.

140
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,269
Not bad. How are you doing so far?

141
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,437
I'm getting about three-quarters right.

142
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:29,042
The boy's on a roll. When you're hot, you're hot.

143
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:33,947
So what are you gonna do?

144
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,416
What do you mean, what am I gonna do?

145
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:41,054
Well, a guy with your, uh,
extracurricular abilities

146
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:43,090
isn't exactly helpless in these matters.

147
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,526
Mm, no.

148
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,595
No, this girl's different, you know.

149
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,564
Yeah, well, so are you.

150
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:55,102
I mean you can read her freakin' mind.

151
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,970
( burps loudly )

152
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,106
You know, have I ever told you that you are one...

153
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:03,576
hopelessly pathetic,
immature excuse for a human being?

154
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,078
( burps )
Yep.

155
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,413
( imitates engine, crash )

156
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:16,156
( metal rasping )

157
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,128
- ( woman screams )
- Stop it! Stop it!

158
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,130
Come on, wake up, Costello!

159
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:59,166
( panting )

160
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,238
- Jesus.
- What am I doing out here?

161
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,374
Hey, beats me.

162
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,609
I'm lying in bed. I hear this yelling.

163
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,345
I thought someone’s being killed out here.

164
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:14,948
I come in. You're standing
in the corner screaming.

165
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,084
I was standing up?

166
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:21,221
- How did I get out here?
- I guess you walked.

167
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,423
In my sleep?

168
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,992
Must have been a hell of a dream.

169
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:29,062
( exhales )
Yeah, it was.

170
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,131
Yeah well, look, I'd...
I'd love to hear all about it,

171
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,967
but it's the middle of the
night and I'm kind of bagged.

172
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:37,004
So if you don't mind,
let me hear about it in the morning, okay?

173
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,062
( honking horn )

174
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,477
Hello?

175
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:53,346
( flute sonata playing )

176
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:09,296
Mr. Costello.

177
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,099
Oh, I... I'm sorry.

178
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,800
The door was open, so I just...

179
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,806
Is there something I can do for you today?

180
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,210
Yeah, I just have a drop form I need you to sign.

181
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,512
- A drop form?
- Yeah.

182
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,682
- Don't you like the class?
- I like the class a lot.

183
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:33,353
Well then, I don't understand.

184
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,390
Could you just sign the form, please?

185
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,335
There, now I'm officially out of your class,

186
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,270
which means that I'm no longer your student

187
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:53,506
and you're no longer my teacher, so...

188
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,444
I don't believe this.

189
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:00,347
You dropped my class just so you can take me out?

190
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:03,116
Well, I know this is going to sound

191
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,717
a little old-fashioned, Miss Young,

192
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,519
but I guess I’m the kind of guy

193
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:09,122
who likes to play by the rules.

194
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,792
And what makes you think

195
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,827
that I want to go out with you?

196
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,499
I like Dostoevsky. I like Bach.

197
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:23,536
And I'm completely addicted to Chinese food.

198
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:35,148
- ( plate shatters )
- ( whistling, cheering )

199
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:38,318
- Hey, Nick, listen, you gotta help me out.
- Yeah? What?

200
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,753
Well, you see, I need to borrow your car.

201
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,623
I also need some money, yeah, say around 40 bucks.

202
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,192
You think you can help me out?

203
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,360
I got a date with Laurel.

204
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:51,631
( laughs ) You sneaky son of a bitch.

205
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:54,501
Come on, man, can you help me out?
This is serious.

206
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,769
So you get my car and my money,

207
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,172
- and what do I get?
- I don't know.

208
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:01,174
I'll make it up to you later.

209
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,610
Yeah well, I'll make it really easy for you.

210
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,845
Come here, Costello.

211
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,815
Check that out. That's Lucinda.

212
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:12,185
- She is quite something, eh?
- Yeah, she's not bad.

213
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,388
- What's this?
- That's hers.

214
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:18,558
You are such an unscrupulous sack of
shit, you know that?

215
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:20,593
Yeah, I know.

216
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,266
Okay, she likes green or maybe blue.

217
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,235
- That's her favorite color.
- Blue.

218
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:31,771
- Um, she loves the Beatles.
- Mm-hmm.

219
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:35,608
She has a kid sister named Stacy.

220
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:37,977
- Her favorite movie was <i>The Lost Boys.
- The Lost Boys?</i>

221
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,979
Yeah, she thinks vampires are very sexy.

222
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,948
- You got all that?
- Yeah.

223
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:43,916
- All right, there you go.
- Thank you.

224
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,553
40 bucks. There you go.

225
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,589
- I love you like a brother.
- I know.

226
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,591
Oh, one thing...

227
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,960
She kind of thinks you’re a bit of a geek.

228
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,662
Good luck.

229
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,765
( chuckles )

230
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,336
Lucinda.

231
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:14,914
( bottles clink )

232
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,288
- Can I help you?
- It's no problem.

233
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,556
It's a delivery for Miss Young, 1406.

234
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,592
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

235
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,696
( elevator dings )

236
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,282
( elevator dings )

237
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,954
What are you doing here?

238
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,690
I'm sorry?

239
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,959
I asked you a question. What are you doing here?

240
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,296
- Well, what's it to you?
- I happen to live here.

241
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,565
This is a security building. How did you get in?

242
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,567
Well, I'm visiting a friend.

243
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,736
- Who?
- Laurel Young.

244
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:13,673
- Are you a student of hers?
- I was.

245
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16,543
You're on the wrong floor.

246
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:21,548
- I know that.
- Mm.

247
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:24,451
Well, have a nice evening.

248
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,853
Thanks.

249
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,443
( knocking )

250
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:53,112
- Hi.
- Hi.

251
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,015
- Wow, you look great.
- Oh, thanks.

252
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:59,018
- You look pretty good yourself.
- Thanks.

253
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:07,059
- So, um, I'm starving.
- Yeah, me too.

254
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,895
I know this great Chinese restaurant.

255
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,597
Well, actually...

256
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,964
Here, let me help you with this.

257
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,467
Actually I kind of had something else in mind.

258
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,469
I... I think you're going to like it though.

259
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,838
Oh, okay.

260
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,946
It's really a beautiful place you got here.

261
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,915
Oh thanks. It was my grandmother's.

262
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:30,750
She left it to me.

263
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,785
I couldn't afford this on my own.

264
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:37,857
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

265
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,793
I'm gonna take you someplace
you’ve never been before.

266
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,569
Uh, thanks.

267
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:52,104
Oh my.

268
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,774
This is an unpretentious and intimate little place

269
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:57,510
that I like to call cafe Ming Costello.

270
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,145
- ( laughs )
- Would you like to sit down?

271
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:02,482
Oh yes, please. Thank you.

272
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,917
This is lovely.

273
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:08,020
It's a bit cold, but it's very picturesque.

274
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:12,825
- A little mood music for us.
- ( flute sonata playing )

275
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:15,061
Actually the owner is a friend of mine.

276
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,763
This place is usually jammed,

277
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:19,932
but I slipped him a Franklin
and the place is ours.

278
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,834
It certainly is.

279
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:24,771
Oh, I hope you like Szechuan food.

280
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:26,873
I took the liberty of buying everything.

281
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:30,477
- I love Szechuan.
- ( siren blaring )

282
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,980
- For you.
- Thank you.

283
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:38,951
So tell me, Mr. Costello,

284
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:41,654
what made you want to go out with me so badly

285
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:43,990
that you dropped my class?

286
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:45,958
Well, I think it was the combination

287
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:49,996
of your fabulous teaching technique,

288
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:53,800
your leadership, insightful criticism,

289
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,035
sparkling smile,

290
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:59,038
- incredible legs...
- Please.

291
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,907
( helicopter whirring )

292
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:08,815
( laughing )

293
00:24:12,652 --> 00:24:16,188
- Oh, let me take this from you.
- Oh thanks.

294
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,893
So can I see you tomorrow night?

295
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:23,863
Patrick, I like you. I really do.

296
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:26,499
I sense a "but" coming.

297
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,635
Well, I've been seeing someone.

298
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:29,936
You've been seeing someone?

299
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,671
Or you've sort of been seeing someone,

300
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:34,040
or you're unbelievably,
incredibly involved with someone, what?

301
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:36,008
I don't know. It's new.

302
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,545
I mean he's older. He's mature.

303
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:40,012
He's very stable.

304
00:24:40,046 --> 00:24:43,950
- Incredibly boring?
- Definitely not boring.

305
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,919
So, um, I get the picture.

306
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:48,521
I guess tomorrow night’s out then.

307
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:50,757
I didn't say that.

308
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,525
No, you didn't.

309
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,026
Can we talk about it tomorrow?

310
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,863
I don't see why not.

311
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:15,014
Good night.

312
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:18,017
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay.

313
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,806
woman: Get your hands off me!

314
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,809
No! Help me!

315
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,844
Hold up your gun, Frank.

316
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:51,183
No! Help me!

317
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,289
Bill, help me!

318
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,027
( snoring )

319
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,130
Pfft.

320
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,772
( metal rasping )

321
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:57,884
Don't you know it’s impolite to stare?

322
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,756
Don't you know it's impolite to stare?

323
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,392
Hmm.

324
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,062
( screams )

325
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:13,933
Somebody please! Help me!

326
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:18,004
( choking, coughing )

327
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,300
( banging on door )

328
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,003
( gasps )

329
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:53,372
Nick: Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

330
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,075
I'm coming. Jesus.

331
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:59,478
- Costello.
- ( banging )

332
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,081
What? yeah, just a minute.

333
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,053
Costello, I thought you were in bed, man.

334
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:10,790
Aw, Jesus.

335
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:12,291
Come on, man, wake up.

336
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:19,331
Come on, man, wake up.

337
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:22,869
( panting )

338
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:25,071
- Nick, what's going on?
- "What's going on"?

339
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:27,073
Are you serious?

340
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:29,375
You're sleepwalking again, for Christ's sake.

341
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,977
You're even dressing for it.

342
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,345
- You're dangerous, man.
- I'm sorry, man.

343
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:36,115
Yeah well, do me a favor
and do yourself a favor...

344
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,751
Go see someone.

345
00:28:38,785 --> 00:28:40,987
Get a prescription.

346
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:46,959
( honks )

347
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:09,015
- Patrick.
- Hi, Laurel.

348
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,850
Can I speak to you for a sec?

349
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:13,119
Um, this isn’t a good time.

350
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:14,987
It's kind of important.

351
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:17,957
Well, actually, Patrick,
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

352
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,993
- That's okay. I'll just take a second.
- No, it's not okay.

353
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:23,229
I'm busy. There's someone here.

354
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,798
Okay, okay.

355
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:28,134
I'll just tell you out here then.

356
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:31,237
Uh, it's kind of hard to explain,

357
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,472
but there's this man

358
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:34,573
and he lives in this building.

359
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,176
And I just get a really weird feeling about him.

360
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:40,146
- I think you should stay away from him.
- What man?

361
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:43,082
- Professor Steering.
- What?

362
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,551
Laurel, is that for me?

363
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:48,988
No, Ted, it's for me.

364
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,557
If you don't mind, this'll just take a minute.

365
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,165
What the hell’s going on here, Patrick?

366
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,270
So that's Ted, huh?

367
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,105
That's the guy you’ve been seeing?

368
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:09,475
Yes, that's right.

369
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,477
Now if you don't mind...

370
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,847
- Laurel.
- What?

371
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:18,084
Forget it.

372
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:39,071
( phones ringing, chatter )

373
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,317
I need some information on the homicide case

374
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,052
of the guy who’s strangling women.

375
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,453
Do you know who’s handling that?

376
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:59,258
Excuse me, are you Detective Markowitz?

377
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:00,960
Yeah yeah, can I do something for you?

378
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:02,594
- Hi, I'm Patrick Costello.
- Uh-huh.

379
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,563
- I have some information for you.
- That's great.

380
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,133
- Look, just sit down right over here, okay?
- Okay, thanks.

381
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,335
So what kind of information?

382
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:13,272
It's about this case that you guys are
working on... the guy who kills women.

383
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,607
What kind of information, Mr. Costello?

384
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,944
I think I saw the killer.

385
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:19,979
How do you know he’s the killer?

386
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:22,081
He was in a car and he was strangling a woman.

387
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:25,084
- Where was the car?
- I'm not exactly sure.

388
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:28,087
- I think on the waterfront maybe.
- Where on the Waterfront?

389
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,488
I just told you I’m not exactly sure.

390
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:32,324
You're telling me you saw
some guy killing some lady

391
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:34,026
and you don't know where it was?

392
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,328
I can give you a description of the man.

393
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:38,364
How come you don't know where it was?

394
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:42,034
Well, how is it you don't know where it was?

395
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:44,403
( sighs )

396
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:48,140
- I'm a psychic.
- A psychic?

397
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:52,378
Got some clippings here,

398
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,114
articles that were written about me.

399
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:59,185
Oh yeah, Patrick Costello.

400
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:02,054
Oh, Child Psychic, yes.

401
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:04,723
This is fascinating.

402
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,694
Maybe you can give us a practical demonstration.

403
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,229
What am I thinking?

404
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,965
Well, it doesn't exactly work that way.

405
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:15,567
Come on, Costello,
you gotta give us something to go on.

406
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:19,005
How does it work, Costello?

407
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:20,372
Well, you see, I see things.

408
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:22,508
Sometimes it happens when I touch something,

409
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,476
other times... I don't know, it just happens.

410
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,045
You know, it just comes to me.

411
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:28,614
All right, look, here's my lighter.

412
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:32,418
Now you tell me what kind of car I drive.

413
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,126
A red Camaro?

414
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,362
Look, you're just wasting my time, kid.

415
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,364
Hey, come on, he was half right. It is red.

416
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,699
Look, it doesn’t always happen
when I want it to, okay?

417
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:49,435
It's kind of hard to do it under pressure.

418
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,138
Well, thanks very much for dropping
by, Mr. Costello.

419
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:55,074
And you... you stay in touch, okay?

420
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:58,244
Look, I'm not some kind of crackpot, okay?
I saw this guy.

421
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:00,512
I also saw the victim. I can describe her to you.

422
00:33:00,546 --> 00:33:01,680
She was in her early 20s.

423
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:05,017
She had long, wavy reddish hair.
She was Caucasian.

424
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:06,352
She also... she had this tattoo.

425
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,420
It was like roses on her chest and...

426
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,522
none of the victims had a tattoo.

427
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:14,293
Maybe he just killed her.
Maybe you guys haven’t found the body yet.

428
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,028
Maybe you'd just better get out of here

429
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:18,130
before I throw you out, okay?

430
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:27,339
I think you hurt his feelings.

431
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:30,776
Aw, poor baby.

432
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:34,413
Yo, Costello.

433
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:38,217
Listen, I'm curious about something.

434
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:42,054
This crime scene that you think you saw,

435
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:44,523
is there anything about it? Anything that might...

436
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:47,126
help you identify it?

437
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:49,128
Listen, I've been over it so many times.

438
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:50,829
I've told you everything.

439
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,265
Any buildings?

440
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:57,169
- Actually, yeah, I think so.
- Any distinctive features?

441
00:33:57,203 --> 00:34:00,339
I'm sorry, I just can't remember.

442
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,840
Okay, all right.

443
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:06,078
Well listen, if you do, give me a holler, huh?

444
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:08,347
- Yeah sure.
- All right.

445
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:13,219
I'm telling you, Nick, I know what I saw.

446
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,387
Yeah okay, but how do you know it's for real?

447
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:18,424
I mean you were dreaming, for Christ's sake.

448
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,228
Look, this guy Steering, eh?

449
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:24,230
He's the guy she’s going out with, right?

450
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:27,099
- Yeah, so?
- So it's natural. You're bummed.

451
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:30,536
You can't stand the guy,
so you start dreaming that he's a killer.

452
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,339
No, you see, the night I dreamed about Steering...

453
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:36,375
that was before I met him at Laurel's apartment.

454
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,876
Yeah, but you said you saw him

455
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,213
- in the building once before.
- Yeah, so? But...

456
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,882
Look, Nick, I'm telling you I know he's the guy.

457
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,653
- He's the one.
- Come on, admit it. You don't like the guy.

458
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:51,223
But murder? Jesus.

459
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:55,294
- Have you seen a doctor yet?
- A doctor?

460
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:58,297
Yeah, a doctor, about that sleepwalking problem.

461
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,267
No. Don't worry, I will.

462
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:06,338
Yeah. Come on.

463
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,755
It's very nice of you, but I don't do it.

464
00:35:56,788 --> 00:35:59,191
- I'm closed.
- Sorry.

465
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,906
( needle buzzing )

466
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:23,882
Hi, is there somebody who could... Thanks.

467
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,890
Hello?

468
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,925
Greetings.

469
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:40,399
Hi, I was wondering,
have you given this tattoo to anyone

470
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:44,336
like a young lady, say, in the last six months?

471
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,639
A tattoo cannot be given. It is transferred.

472
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,541
I'm only the medium.

473
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,978
Of course, I understand.

474
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:54,980
Do you think you could help me out though?

475
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:57,916
I think I knew this woman before...

476
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,851
In a previous life.

477
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:01,987
Just a minute.

478
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:12,564
April, April Harris.

479
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:14,966
I transferred such a tattoo to April Harris

480
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,736
on the Autumn equinox,

481
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,339
a very propitious day.

482
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:24,843
Perhaps I have a design that you would enjoy.

483
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:33,018
( baby crying )

484
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,944
- Yeah?
- Hi, is April Harris here?

485
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:01,713
- No.
- Well... excuse me. Excuse me.

486
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:04,850
- Do you know where she is?
- No.

487
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:07,419
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,

488
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:09,054
but it's really important.

489
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:11,357
When was the last time you saw her?

490
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:15,994
I'm not sure. A couple of days anyway.

491
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:20,466
You see her, you tell her rent's due.

492
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,956
( ringing )

493
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,959
- Hi.
- Hello, Patrick. It's Laurel.

494
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,128
<i>This is Patrick. Nick and I aren't in now.</i>

495
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,998
<i>If you wanna leave a message, you know what to do.</i>

496
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:12,584
( door opens )

497
00:39:12,618 --> 00:39:14,453
( closes )

498
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:23,895
( doorknob rattling )

499
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,397
( dog barking )

500
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:22,921
( thuds )

501
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:37,068
- ( glass shatters )
- Shit!

502
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:06,865
( metal rasping )

503
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:17,943
( screams )

504
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,745
Who the hell are you

505
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:21,613
and what are you doing in my room?

506
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:22,914
April Harris?

507
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:25,551
Yeah, that's right.

508
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:27,753
Who the hell are you?

509
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:29,555
What happened to your hair?

510
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:32,758
- Okay, I'm calling the cops.
- No, no, no, no, wait.

511
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:36,828
Um... you're okay.

512
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:38,630
Yeah, of course I’m all right.

513
00:41:38,664 --> 00:41:41,867
- Listen, I'm really... Get your hands off me!

514
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,168
- Woman: April?
- Okay, okay.

515
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:45,537
April, what's going on?

516
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:47,639
This guy broke in. I'm calling the cops.

517
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:49,975
Wait, let me just ask you one question.

518
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,977
Do you ever go ice skating?

519
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,980
Look, now are you gonna leave

520
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,548
or do I have to call the cops?

521
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:58,884
Okay, I'm going. I'm going right now.

522
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:01,519
Sorry. big mistake.

523
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:27,145
April, I'm sorry.

524
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:28,847
He said he was a friend of yours.

525
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,716
- I thought... Oh.

526
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:32,751
It's all right.

527
00:42:34,352 --> 00:42:37,989
- This color sucks, doesn't it?
- I like it.

528
00:42:38,023 --> 00:42:40,992
It sucks. I'm changing it.

529
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:44,596
- To what?
- Red.

530
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,033
Red? April, not again.

531
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,002
I think I'm gonna be a redhead.

532
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:33,011
- Hi.
- Hi.

533
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,115
Long time no see.

534
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:45,056
I... I know what you’re thinking.

535
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:49,094
You're thinking that I acted like an immature,

536
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,229
jealous, possessive,

537
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:54,933
foolish, childish jerk this morning, right?

538
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:59,738
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

539
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:04,409
You're probably also thinking
that I've got a lot of nerve

540
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:07,645
to come back here without apologizing, so...

541
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,819
These are for you.

542
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:55,086
( ship's horn blaring in distance )

543
00:46:07,065 --> 00:46:09,434
- Hey.
- Where the hell have you been?

544
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:12,270
- I ran out of gas.
- Yeah, sure.

545
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,305
Over here.

546
00:46:16,842 --> 00:46:19,310
- Same M.O.?
- Yeah, looks like it.

547
00:46:19,344 --> 00:46:21,046
The same belt marks on her neck.

548
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:23,314
It's the same killer all right.

549
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,193
The only guy who knew about her
tattoo was that kid Costello.

550
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:38,529
Yeah, well, maybe the guy is for real, huh? Okay.

551
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:41,032
Maybe the guy really could see something else.

552
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:44,535
What, in a dream? Get real, Ricky.

553
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:45,971
He saw something, all right.

554
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:48,406
He saw something because he did it.

555
00:46:49,908 --> 00:46:51,910
( clock ticking )

556
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,998
( gasps )

557
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,839
( Ted's voice )
What's the matter?

558
00:47:23,108 --> 00:47:26,111
( normal voice )
Are you alright?

559
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:30,181
Yeah, um, I'm okay.

560
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:34,352
I've gotta go.

561
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,493
I don't wanna go.

562
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:47,565
Get outta here. Come on, scram.

563
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:55,273
- Bye.
- Bye.

564
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:13,091
( music playing on TV )

565
00:48:13,124 --> 00:48:14,125

( dings )

580
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:19,590
- Hey, I've been looking all over for you.
- Hi.

581
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:22,260
Look, I was right.
You can't see him anymore. He's dangerous.

582
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,996
- What?
- I just saw on the TV. They found the body.

583
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,033
- What are you talking about?
- April Harris's body...

584
00:49:28,066 --> 00:49:30,101
They found it down by the waterfront.

585
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:32,470
Wait a minute.

586
00:49:34,105 --> 00:49:37,042
Are you saying someone was
killed and you know who did it?

587
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:40,145
Yes, your friend Theodore Steering, that's who.

588
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:42,313
What could possibly make you say that?

589
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:44,782
What are you talking about? I saw him do it.

590
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:48,053
- What did you see?
- Listen, Laurel,

591
00:49:48,086 --> 00:49:50,388
there's something I haven't
told you about me, okay?

592
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:53,224
Ever since I can remember I’ve
been capable of seeing things.

593
00:49:53,258 --> 00:49:56,027
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- No. What are you saying?

594
00:49:57,462 --> 00:49:59,130
I'm psychic.

595
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:01,032
Look, remember that time in your office...

596
00:50:01,066 --> 00:50:02,800
You remember when I knew about Dostoevsky and Bach

597
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,569
and Chinese food and all that stuff?

598
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:06,571
How do you think I knew about that?

599
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:11,042
- Do you think that was just a lucky guess?
- I don't believe this.

600
00:50:11,076 --> 00:50:13,044
- Are you saying that everything...
- Shh, shh!

601
00:50:13,078 --> 00:50:14,745
...between us...

602
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:17,115
are you saying that you were
spying on me or something?

603
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:20,118
- No no, that's not what I'm saying at all.
- Do you know what I think?

604
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:22,453
I think that you just don't like
the fact that I'm seeing Ted.

605
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:25,123
- You haven't even heard a word that I've said...
- I've had enough of this!

606
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:27,158
If you don't like the fact that I'm seeing Ted,

607
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:28,393
then you can talk to me about it.

608
00:50:28,426 --> 00:50:31,129
Be up front to me about it,
but don’t start making up stories.

609
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:32,830
- You're not even listening.
- Yes, I'm listening to you.

610
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,600
Fine, you can believe what you
want, but let me tell you one thing:

611
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:37,602
Ted Steering is a very very sick man,

612
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:39,337
and I'm telling you he’s killing people.

613
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,406
Well, then stop wasting your time talking to me.

614
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:44,075
Go out and get him before he kills again.

615
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:49,314
( classical music playing )

616
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:53,451
Thank you.

617
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,186
Thanks.

618
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:01,159
I have to go to New Hampshire
for a seminar this weekend.

619
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:02,693
Do you want to come with me?

620
00:51:05,863 --> 00:51:08,065
( sighs )

621
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,169
Why don't you tell me what’s bothering you?

622
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,406
Do you remember my friend Patrick

623
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,608
who came over to my apartment the other day?

624
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:19,577
Yes.

625
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,878
Well, first of all I should tell you

626
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,248
that I've sort of been seeing him.

627
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:27,785
I knew that.

628
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:32,157
- Is there a problem?
- No.

629
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:37,228
But I told him that I had been seeing you too.

630
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:38,896
And then he tells me he’s been having

631
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,199
these dreams and you're in them.

632
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:46,271
What kind of dreams?

633
00:51:50,175 --> 00:51:53,611
Dreams about women being
violently murdered by you.

634
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:57,648
( laughs )

635
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,684
Oh boy.

636
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:03,388
And what do you make of that?

637
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:08,793
He's internalizing his anger

638
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:13,298
and his subconscious is saying that his rival

639
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:15,833
wants to murder the object of his desire,

640
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:20,405
perhaps because subconsciously

641
00:52:20,438 --> 00:52:24,375
he'd rather see her dead than with another man.

642
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:28,379
That's very interesting, Professor.

643
00:52:28,413 --> 00:52:30,681
Then I guess this weekend is out of the question.

644
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:37,822
- You feel better, don't you?
- Yes.

645
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:40,758
Ah. It helps to talk about it.

646
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:42,827
My mother taught me that...
Before I killed her.

647
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,296
( both laughing )

648
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:12,423
( scraping )

649
00:54:07,712 --> 00:54:09,647
( huffs )

650
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:20,525
What are you doing here?

651
00:54:44,048 --> 00:54:46,417
( chuckling )

652
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:02,867
( bell tolling )

653
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:05,836
- ( hammer clicks )
- Freeze!

654
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:08,373
Hi.

655
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:12,042
- I said freeze!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

656
00:55:26,123 --> 00:55:27,958
That's him.

657
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:31,896
( thunder rumbling )

658
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:35,566
- Excuse me, are you Dr. Steering?
- Yes, I am.

659
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,503
I'm afraid there’s been a little
problem in your apartment.

660
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:41,639
- What kind of a problem?
- There was a break-in.

661
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:42,973
But don't worry, we got the guy

662
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,842
and it doesn't look like he got anything.

663
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:48,012
- There he is.
- ( police radio chatter )

664
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:58,055
( car starts )

665
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:12,403
You know, I think maybe we
made a mistake with you.

666
00:56:12,437 --> 00:56:14,905
I think maybe we should
have listened to you before.

667
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:21,111
- Ever seen a belt buckle like this?
- No.

668
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,981
All right, let's start with April Harris.

669
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:25,883
Tell me everything you know about her.

670
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:28,519
- I've already told you.
- Well, tell us again.

671
00:56:28,553 --> 00:56:29,987
Maybe there’s something we missed.

672
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,956
She went to school with you, right?

673
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:33,558
Is that where you met her?

674
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:35,626
I told you, I've never met her before.

675
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:38,429
Yeah, but you must have seen
her on the campus before, right?

676
00:56:38,463 --> 00:56:40,565
I don't think so, no.

677
00:56:40,598 --> 00:56:41,866
A good-looking girl like that?

678
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:44,869
You see a girl like that, you don't forget her.

679
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:47,672
Look, what is this?
I thought you guys wanted me to help you.

680
00:56:47,705 --> 00:56:49,674
Well, I do. You're helping us.

681
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:52,743
Just try and answer the questions.

682
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:55,813
Now when did you first see her?

683
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:58,048
I told you, in a dream.

684
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:02,019
Oh, come on, Costello, you saw her before that.

685
00:57:02,052 --> 00:57:04,021
Now why don't you tell me?

686
00:57:06,957 --> 00:57:10,194
- No, Detective, why don't you tell me?
- All right.

687
00:57:10,227 --> 00:57:13,163
You saw her on the campus and
you were attracted to her.

688
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:15,165
Then one day you... you met her,

689
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:19,570
and you were gonna give her a ride home.

690
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:21,939
But you don’t take her home.

691
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:25,075
You stop someplace and park

692
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:28,145
because you wanna talk.

693
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:31,749
She starts freaking. She's gonna call the cops.

694
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,985
You get upset.

695
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:38,589
You didn't realize how upset
you were getting, did you?

696
00:57:38,623 --> 00:57:41,959
And then it all sort of just happened.

697
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,029
You didn't mean to hurt her, did you?

698
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,932
It was an accident.

699
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:51,068
It wasn't supposed to happen that way, was it?

700
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:56,641
You know, Detective,

701
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:59,610
I really don't know what makes me more sick...

702
00:57:59,644 --> 00:58:02,012
Having to listen to your crap

703
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:03,981
or having to look at you.

704
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:06,817
- You slimy little jerk!
- Ricky: Hey, hey, hey!

705
00:58:06,851 --> 00:58:09,086
Come on, come on. Come on now.

706
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,055
Take a pill. Have a coffee, all right?

707
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:14,892
Come on. Boy, oh boy, oh boy.

708
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:17,962
- Go have a coffee or something.
- Yeah, yeah.

709
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:22,199
Ricky: All right, look,
now we're getting all upset here.

710
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:25,803
Now, Patrick,
you wanna tell me what really happened?

711
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,738
You wanna talk to me now?

712
00:58:27,772 --> 00:58:29,640
Well, that depends. Are you ready to listen?

713
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:32,543
I'm all ears, kid.

714
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:36,614
I know who the killer is.

715
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:38,315
- Oh, you do, do you?
- Yeah.

716
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,318
- Well, why didn't you tell us before?
- Because no one asked me.

717
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,888
So now I'm asking.

718
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:47,091
His name is Steering...
Professor Theodore Steering.

719
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:48,959
He's on the faculty at the University.

720
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:50,928
He teaches Psychology.

721
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:53,230
Looks like we're gonna have to arrest you, Doc.

722
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:59,036
Ricky: And this is the same Dr. Steering

723
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:00,370
whose apartment you just broke into?

724
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:03,040
That's right. I needed to go
in there and get some evidence,

725
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:05,776
something that would make you
guys believe me. He's the guy!

726
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,277
I know it. He's the one.

727
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:09,914
I just... I just can't prove it yet.

728
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,652
Can you tell me what he's being charged with?

729
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:16,654
- Hold on a second.
- Because if he's not

730
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:20,024
being charged with anything,
you can't just hold him.

731
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21,992
Who the hell are you, kid, his attorney?

732
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:25,730
I'm sorry, sir, but this kid is yelling...

733
00:59:25,763 --> 00:59:29,634
This report of yours, Doctor,
I read through it again.

734
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:31,268
It's kind of interesting.

735
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:34,905
"The killer is most likely a young man,

736
00:59:34,939 --> 00:59:39,076
probably good-looking,
but he feels self-conscious.

737
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,645
Something sets him apart.

738
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:44,882
Relations with the opposite
sex are problematic for him.

739
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,951
He may be prone to fits of irrational jealousy."

740
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:49,954
I'd say that description fits
Patrick Costello to a tee.

741
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:54,191
- Wouldn't you, Doctor?
-  A lot of people could fit that profile, Detective.

742
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:56,794
The fact is I don't know Mr. Costello that well.

743
00:59:56,827 --> 01:00:00,064
He seems to know you pretty good, Doc.

744
01:00:01,766 --> 01:00:04,669
We have a... we have a mutual friend.

745
01:00:04,702 --> 01:00:07,071
- Ricky: A friend?
- Mm.

746
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,373
There's a young lady I’m rather fond of.

747
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:10,975
Oh, yeah.

748
01:00:11,008 --> 01:00:14,845
Seems young Costello is rather fond of her too.

749
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:19,116
Well, Detective, I think if you were to meet her,

750
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:21,151
you'd understand why.

751
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,823
- Is that all?
- That's all for now,

752
01:00:25,856 --> 01:00:27,958
but we'll keep in touch, okay?

753
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:30,160
- Thanks, Doc.
- You're welcome.

754
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,169
- ( door opens )
- Ricky: Time to go, champ.

755
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:43,941
Dr. Steering has decided not to
press charges on the burglary.

756
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:47,144
Keep in touch, huh? Stay out of trouble.

757
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,718
Take this down to the lab and
see what they can give us.

758
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:55,319
Yeah, I don't know what the hell for.

759
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:58,022
He don't have a record.
There ain't gonna be nothing on file.

760
01:00:58,055 --> 01:00:59,790
Maybe they'll find something else.

761
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:01,826
- You never know.
- No.

762
01:01:14,939 --> 01:01:16,941
Excuse me.

763
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:20,044
( birds screeching )

764
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:07,091
( April screams )

765
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:11,962
woman: And then when I came back in,

766
01:02:11,996 --> 01:02:13,931
she was talking with the same guy.

767
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:15,232
She was arguing.

768
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:17,101
And she said that she didn't know him.

769
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:19,469
She said that he broke in.

770
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:22,873
Now this guy, would you recognize
him if you saw him again?

771
01:02:22,907 --> 01:02:24,174
Yeah, I just saw him.

772
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:25,943
He walked out of here 10 minutes ago.

773
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:27,111
- Where, in the elevator?
- Yeah.

774
01:02:27,144 --> 01:02:29,446
- Hey, Adam, Adam.
- Yeah?

775
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,882
Got a match on Costello’s prints.

776
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:34,184
They're all over the dead girl's bedroom.

777
01:02:34,218 --> 01:02:35,886
( phone clacks )

778
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,187
( banging on door )

779
01:02:37,221 --> 01:02:38,956
- Yeah, what? Hey!
- Adam: Come on!

780
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:42,526
Hey, take it easy. What?

781
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,029
Yeah, what... Hey, what the hell are you doing?

782
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:47,164
- You can't just bust in here...
- This says we can.

783
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:49,066
- What's that?
- It's a warrant.

784
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:51,001
- A warrant for what?
- Check his room, in here.

785
01:02:51,035 --> 01:02:54,004
- Costello's apartment.
- You think Costello’s done something?

786
01:02:54,038 --> 01:02:55,339
Let me tell you something, Sonny,

787
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:57,942
your roomie's not such a great
guy once you get to know him.

788
01:02:57,975 --> 01:03:01,345
Holy shit. What are... What are you looking for?

789
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:04,214
- Hey, get... Come on, man.
- Listen, your friend into jewelry, huh?

790
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:05,950
- What?
- Into jewelry, I said.

791
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,417
- You ever seen this before?
- What?

792
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,019
- Huh?
- No. What is it? I've never seen it.

793
01:03:09,053 --> 01:03:10,487
Go sit down and read a magazine, kid.

794
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,389
- Hey, look, it's my place...
- I said sit down!

795
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:14,424
All right. Jesus.

796
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:22,466
Hey, what the hell’s going on here?

797
01:03:22,499 --> 01:03:24,969
- Patrick Costello, you're under arrest.
- For what?

798
01:03:25,002 --> 01:03:26,603
- ( thuds )
- Nick: Hey!

799
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,205
- Keep your hands off him.
- I said sit down.

800
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:30,340
- Okay, fine.
- Adam: Sorry about that.

801
01:03:30,374 --> 01:03:33,277
- For murder.
- What do you mean murder?

802
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,279
Ricky: All right,
you got the right to remain silent.

803
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:38,115
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

804
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:39,283
You have the right to an attorney.

805
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,418
If you cannot afford an
attorney, one will be provided.

806
01:03:41,451 --> 01:03:42,953
You understand these rights?

807
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:45,489
Adam: Clear out, guys.

808
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:50,060
Come on, get outta here.

809
01:04:15,052 --> 01:04:17,254
All right, hit the lights.

810
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:29,466
Number two.

811
01:04:32,036 --> 01:04:34,571
He's the one. Number two.

812
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:38,976
- Number two. Now you're sure?
- Yeah.

813
01:04:39,009 --> 01:04:41,511
- Okay, thank you very much.
- Thanks a lot.

814
01:04:46,116 --> 01:04:48,185
( door opens )

815
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,924
Mr. Costello?

816
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:58,362
I'm Randolph Fitzgerald.

817
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:01,231
I'll be representing you in court.

818
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:04,534
I gotta be honest with you.

819
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:09,139
I don't think we have a very good situation here.

820
01:05:09,173 --> 01:05:11,075
I think we should have

821
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:13,310
a nice frank discussion about it.

822
01:05:13,343 --> 01:05:15,045
I didn't do it.

823
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:19,249
- Excuse me?
- I just said I didn't do it.

824
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:23,954
Okay, Mr. Costello, there's a doctor arriving

825
01:05:23,988 --> 01:05:26,023
to do a little psychological evaluation

826
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:29,226
of your fitness to stand trial.

827
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,628
Mr. Costello, this is Dr....

828
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,630
We've already met. Thank you, Counselor.

829
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:37,401
Coffee?

830
01:05:42,672 --> 01:05:46,143
Before we go any further, Mr. Costello,

831
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:48,979
I want you to know that I think you're innocent.

832
01:05:49,013 --> 01:05:52,082
I also understand that you don't
share the same feeling about me.

833
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:56,020
Detective Spencer told me about your visions.

834
01:05:57,387 --> 01:05:59,089
Sugar?

835
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:05,162
Now I don't believe in so-called
psychic phenomena per se,

836
01:06:05,195 --> 01:06:07,664
but I do believe that you saw
what you claimed to have seen...

837
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:11,335
Not in a vision and not in a dream,

838
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:14,104
but in person.

839
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:17,407
I believe that you were actually present

840
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:20,177
when one or more of these incidents happened.

841
01:06:25,182 --> 01:06:27,584
I just want you to think about that.

842
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:29,986
You must have been there.

843
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:35,092
But how could I have...

844
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:36,393
How could I have done something

845
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:39,429
and have absolutely no recollection of it?

846
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:43,367
Have you been experiencing
any unusual behavior recently?

847
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:46,436
What kind of behavior?

848
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:52,742
Blackouts, dizzy spells, sleepwalking perhaps?

849
01:06:55,712 --> 01:06:57,381
Have you been sleepwalking?

850
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:02,186
No. No, I haven't.

851
01:07:08,092 --> 01:07:10,527
( knocks )

852
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,797
- Miss Young?
- Yes.

853
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:18,168
- You're working pretty late.
- Yes?

854
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:22,439
I'm Detective Spencer... Rick Spencer.

855
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:27,043
You have a friend...
Patrick Costello. Is that correct?

856
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:30,747
Yes.

857
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,351
Yeah well, we're conducting an investigation.

858
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,853
I'm wondering if maybe you could give us a hand.

859
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,488
Of course.

860
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:40,657
It's a murder investigation, Miss Young.

861
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:43,093
The killer used a belt with
a pretty unusual buckle.

862
01:07:43,127 --> 01:07:44,394
It's a little something like that.

863
01:07:44,428 --> 01:07:46,430
You ever seen that buckle before?

864
01:07:49,133 --> 01:07:50,834
No, I've never seen anything like this.

865
01:07:50,867 --> 01:07:53,403
And you've never seen Patrick
Costello wearing something

866
01:07:53,437 --> 01:07:54,838
even remotely similar to this, huh?

867
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:57,507
No.

868
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:01,411
Well, I guess that’s that then.

869
01:08:01,445 --> 01:08:03,547
Listen, if you think of anything,

870
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,482
anything at all, please give me a call.

871
01:08:05,515 --> 01:08:08,118
- Okay.
- Get some sleep.

872
01:08:08,152 --> 01:08:10,587
- Thank you.
- Good night.

873
01:08:21,865 --> 01:08:24,568
Nick: Bail's set at $25,000.

874
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:27,671
Yeah, so what I’m wondering is...

875
01:08:27,704 --> 01:08:29,639
Are you crazy?

876
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:32,242
Come on, man, where am I
gonna get that kind of dough?

877
01:08:32,276 --> 01:08:34,678
You're the bail bondsman.

878
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:38,882
Yeah, yeah, sure, same to you, pal.

879
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:41,117
Jesus.

880
01:08:48,892 --> 01:08:51,361
( knocking at door )

881
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:55,131
Jesus. Just a minute.

882
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:04,174
Hi, can I help you?

883
01:09:04,208 --> 01:09:06,843
- You must be Nick.
- Yeah.

884
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:10,847
- I'm Laurel. I'm Patrick's friend.
- Uh-huh.

885
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,519
- Can I ask you something about Patrick?
- Yeah sure.

886
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:21,358
He said that he had some kind of psychic powers.

887
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:23,393
Is that true?

888
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:31,735
He must like you a lot.

889
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:35,205
He doesn't talk about this with anyone.

890
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:46,316
See, this thing happened when we were kids.

891
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:47,817
It really messed him up.

892
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:52,422
This girl we went to school with was murdered.

893
01:09:52,456 --> 01:09:56,926
The cops figured that Patrick could help them out.

894
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,595
So he did his thing, you know?

895
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:00,397
They gave him some of the stuff

896
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:01,998
she was wearing at the time

897
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,502
and he told them who the killer was.

898
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,005
Mr. Solomon... Real nice guy.

899
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,808
No one could believe it...

900
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:14,444
Until they found out that Mr. Solomon

901
01:10:14,478 --> 01:10:16,446
had been having an affair with Audrey...

902
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,815
That's her name.

903
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:20,717
She was underage.

904
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:25,389
Solomon kept insisting he was innocent

905
01:10:25,422 --> 01:10:28,258
and he said he wanted to take a lie detector test.

906
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:32,862
The morning that he was going to take the test

907
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:35,632
they found him dead.

908
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:37,967
He hanged himself.

909
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:40,970
Then about a month later,
they found this other guy,

910
01:10:41,004 --> 01:10:43,940
a transient.

911
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,610
They found things on him that
sort of linked him to the murder.

912
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:49,879
And then he made a confession, a full confession.

913
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:52,649
He was confessing to a lot of things though.

914
01:10:52,682 --> 01:10:56,986
Patrick blamed himself, you know, for Mr. Solomon.

915
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:01,658
But he said he was so sure, you know?

916
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:03,527
As soon as we graduated, all he wanted to do

917
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:07,331
was get out of town, you know, where no one knew.

918
01:11:07,364 --> 01:11:10,700
I think you're the first person
he’s told about it actually.

919
01:11:13,036 --> 01:11:14,871
( sighs )

920
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:21,445
Thanks for telling me, Nick.

921
01:11:21,478 --> 01:11:23,747
Yeah.

922
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,683
( police radio chatter )

923
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:29,653
- Ricky, you coming or what?
- Huh? No, no.

924
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:31,855
I'm gonna stick around. I'll see you tomorrow.

925
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:34,324
Come on. I'm buying.

926
01:11:34,358 --> 01:11:36,693
( laughs )
What, you buying?

927
01:11:36,726 --> 01:11:39,863
Nah, sorry. Rain check.

928
01:11:39,896 --> 01:11:41,998
What is it?

929
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,033
Nothing.

930
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:47,871
( sighs )
I don't know, Adam.

931
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:49,373
Don't you think the whole thing's

932
01:11:49,406 --> 01:11:50,974
falling into place a little too damn easy?

933
01:11:51,007 --> 01:11:55,579
Ricky, never ever complain
about anything being too easy.

934
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:57,714
You hear what I'm saying?

935
01:11:57,747 --> 01:11:59,916
Yeah, I hear what you're saying.
Let me ask you this.

936
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:03,353
Do you really think this kid
Costello is a serial killer?

937
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:06,022
( laughs )
Hell no.

938
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:08,825
But I think he killed April Harris,

939
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:10,960
and that's good enough.

940
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,665
I'll see you in the morning.

941
01:12:15,699 --> 01:12:17,767
Yeah.

942
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,507
( sighs )

943
01:12:24,908 --> 01:12:27,043
( phone rings )

944
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:29,913
Homicide, Spencer.

945
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:32,015
- Woman: Detective Spencer?
- Yeah.

946
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:33,917
I live across from Slater Park

947
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:36,486
and I'm calling about the girl
that was found dead there.

948
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,655
Uh-huh. What do you know about her?

949
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,824
Well, I think I saw the guy who left her there,

950
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,626
and I took his license plate number.

951
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:44,528
Hold on a second, please. Hey, Adam, hold up!

952
01:12:44,561 --> 01:12:45,962
Okay, you wanna give it to me, please?

953
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:47,964
( chatter )

954
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:50,467
( keys jingling )

955
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,136
Rise and shine, kid. You're out of here.

956
01:12:53,169 --> 01:12:55,939
- What?
- Yeah, we got the killer.

957
01:12:55,972 --> 01:12:58,475
The guy's name is Francis Crocket.

958
01:12:58,508 --> 01:12:59,843
He's a registered sex offender

959
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:02,512
and we got an eyewitness that
puts him at the scene of the crime

960
01:13:02,546 --> 01:13:04,681
right about the time April Harris was killed.

961
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,683
Look, just because you
found this guy near the body

962
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,051
doesn't mean he’s the guy who did it.

963
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:09,953
We've got forensic evidence that places her

964
01:13:09,986 --> 01:13:12,556
in Crocket's car that same evening.

965
01:13:12,589 --> 01:13:16,460
- Oh yeah? What kind of evidence?
- What are you, a cop?

966
01:13:16,493 --> 01:13:18,061
We got a hair sample, for one thing.

967
01:13:18,094 --> 01:13:20,063
And as an added bonus,

968
01:13:20,096 --> 01:13:22,031
we got a complete confession from the guy

969
01:13:22,065 --> 01:13:24,200
not only to the Harris case,
but to three others as well.

970
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,003
Some sick shit, but there it is. You coming?

971
01:13:28,972 --> 01:13:32,776
It turns out he's one of Dr. Steering's patients.

972
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:35,111
- Hey, Sammy.
- Hey, what's happening?

973
01:13:38,214 --> 01:13:40,116
Huh?

974
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:42,952
That's one seriously screwed-up human being.

975
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:47,090
Could have been you, kid. Come on, let's go.

976
01:14:10,714 --> 01:14:12,882
- Hi, I've just come to see Miss Young.
- ( elevator dings )

977
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:14,918
Sure.

978
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:18,922
Hello, Patrick.

979
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,890
Detective Markowitz just called

980
01:14:20,924 --> 01:14:22,826
and told me the news.

981
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:24,861
Yeah, they finally caught the guy.

982
01:14:24,894 --> 01:14:28,665
Yes, so they did.

983
01:14:28,698 --> 01:14:31,134
Well, congratulations.

984
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:33,670
On your release I mean.

985
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:42,779
( door closes )

986
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:45,148
- Laurel.
- In here.

987
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:47,216
I don't know if I should take this sweater or not.

988
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,819
How cold does it getup in the
mountains at night anyway?

989
01:14:49,853 --> 01:14:52,956
I really wouldn't know. I haven't been there.

990
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:55,925
Oh, I thought you were Ted.

991
01:15:00,096 --> 01:15:02,799
I heard about what happened.

992
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,268
It must have been hard on you.

993
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:08,605
Yeah, well, it wasn’t a whole lot of fun actually.

994
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:15,712
No, not just now. I meant before.

995
01:15:15,745 --> 01:15:17,981
Nick told me about Audrey.

996
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:22,018
He told you about Audrey?

997
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,589
( sighs )

998
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:28,992
Did he tell you the whole story?

999
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:31,961
Well, yes. I...

1000
01:15:31,995 --> 01:15:34,230
What I mean is did he tell you her last name?

1001
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:37,567
No, huh?

1002
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:42,038
Her last name was Costello. She was my sister.

1003
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:43,873
Look, just forget it, all right?

1004
01:15:43,907 --> 01:15:45,942
It's ancient history.

1005
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:48,612
Patrick, I'm so sorry.

1006
01:15:51,615 --> 01:15:54,050
I gotta go. I'll see you around.

1007
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:56,019
Patrick, don't do this.

1008
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:59,055
"Don't do this"? I'm not doing anything.

1009
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:02,225
Look, you're free to do
whatever it is you wanna do.

1010
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:05,729
Just take the sweater. He'll love it.

1011
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:11,334
( door opens, closes )

1012
01:16:19,042 --> 01:16:21,044
( dog barks )

1013
01:16:36,259 --> 01:16:38,795
God, it's beautiful.

1014
01:16:44,668 --> 01:16:47,671
( classical music playing )

1015
01:16:52,075 --> 01:16:54,077
Good evening. I'm Dr. Steering.

1016
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,378
I'm here for the symposium.

1017
01:16:55,411 --> 01:16:57,080
Ah, Dr. Steering,

1018
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:58,915
it's a pleasure to have you here again, sir.

1019
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:01,985
The only cottage we have left now is number 16.

1020
01:17:02,018 --> 01:17:04,187
That's about half a mile down the road.

1021
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,955
If you'd prefer a double suite,

1022
01:17:05,989 --> 01:17:07,891
I'm sure we can arrange it at a similar price.

1023
01:17:07,924 --> 01:17:09,192
What do you think?

1024
01:17:09,225 --> 01:17:10,927
You wanna trek down the road a half a mile

1025
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,862
or you wanna stay here in the lodge?

1026
01:17:12,896 --> 01:17:15,364
- It sounds fine. The cottage sounds fine.
- Okay.

1027
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:17,233
All right, so you’ve been preregistered.

1028
01:17:17,266 --> 01:17:19,435
All I'll require is your
credit card for an imprint.

1029
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:21,805
- Thank you.
- ( Laurel clears throat )

1030
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:32,882
All right, Doctor.

1031
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:35,184
- Doctor?
- Thank you.

1032
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:39,889
- ( train horn blaring )
- ( sighs )

1033
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,002
( screams )

1034
01:17:54,871 --> 01:17:56,472
( gasping )

1035
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:59,342
( women choking )

1036
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:24,868
Ted: Far from the madding crowd.

1037
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:28,404
No telephone, no television.

1038
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,740
Yuh! No central heating.

1039
01:18:30,774 --> 01:18:32,909
- ( laughs )
- Look at this.

1040
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:34,477
Can't wait to get into this.

1041
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,813
- Eh, well.
- Oh, it's lovely.

1042
01:18:38,815 --> 01:18:41,450
And the living room... Wait till you see this.

1043
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:45,321
Upstairs are the bedrooms.

1044
01:18:46,489 --> 01:18:47,991
Nice, huh?

1045
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,897
We have our choice of sleeping accommodations.

1046
01:18:57,033 --> 01:18:59,102
You like it?

1047
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,972
It's great.

1048
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:13,449
( wind howling )

1049
01:19:23,526 --> 01:19:27,096
( sighs )

1050
01:19:32,969 --> 01:19:36,205
- Are you cold?
- No.

1051
01:19:42,411 --> 01:19:44,413
Ted...

1052
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:48,952
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

1053
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:53,589
I understand.

1054
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,091
I want to be here with you, but...

1055
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:59,929
Laurel, you don’t have to explain, okay?

1056
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:06,202
Oh boy, let's see what we've got here.

1057
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:08,471
I brought something to warm us up a bit.

1058
01:20:10,606 --> 01:20:13,076
Uh-huh.

1059
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:19,482
A 1985 Bordeaux. Does that sound good?

1060
01:20:19,515 --> 01:20:21,985
Sounds great.

1061
01:20:32,528 --> 01:20:34,330
Hi, yes, this is an emergency.

1062
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:38,034
I'm trying to reach Dr. Theodore Steering.

1063
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:40,569
Yeah.

1064
01:20:40,603 --> 01:20:44,407
Uh-huh. Green Peaks?

1065
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,376
Uh-huh. How do I get there?

1066
01:21:00,023 --> 01:21:02,391
( engine starts )

1067
01:21:06,129 --> 01:21:09,598
It has nothing to do with male-female positioning.

1068
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:11,600
I still don't agree.

1069
01:21:11,634 --> 01:21:14,003
I think your paper is an apology

1070
01:21:14,037 --> 01:21:15,538
for the male point of view.

1071
01:21:17,006 --> 01:21:19,042
( chuckling )

1072
01:21:19,075 --> 01:21:20,944
That's not what it is at all.

1073
01:21:20,977 --> 01:21:22,979
It's a summary of the current research

1074
01:21:23,012 --> 01:21:25,448
into the psychopathology of sexual violence.

1075
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:28,551
I'm not... I'm not even sure
that I believe in it myself.

1076
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:31,487
But then why would you encourage
others to believe in it?

1077
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,158
I... Laurel, I am not encouraging
anybody to believe anything.

1078
01:21:35,191 --> 01:21:38,061
I'm presenting statistics.

1079
01:21:38,094 --> 01:21:41,364
Look, Laurel,

1080
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:44,267
psychology is a very cynical business.

1081
01:21:47,971 --> 01:21:50,206
And I suggest that if you want
to pursue this any further

1082
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:52,308
that we get another bottle of wine.

1083
01:21:52,341 --> 01:21:53,977
I'll get it.

1084
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:57,480
But, Ted, your humor is no defense.

1085
01:21:57,513 --> 01:22:00,049
- You all right?
- I'm sorry.

1086
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:02,018
Serves you right for talking about my humor.

1087
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:03,987
( laughs )
So...

1088
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,989
Anyway, what I'm trying to say

1089
01:22:06,022 --> 01:22:09,625
is the mindset of modern
psychology is male dominant.

1090
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:14,130
It's time fora female
perspective to be acknowledged.

1091
01:22:17,166 --> 01:22:20,269
Believe me, there's nothing more interesting to me

1092
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:22,305
than the female perspective.

1093
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:32,515
Talk to me.

1094
01:22:34,317 --> 01:22:37,686
Talk to me about female perspective.

1095
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,722
I'm all ears.

1096
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:44,527
I think we should clean up.

1097
01:22:47,263 --> 01:22:50,166
Dirty dishes are not a defense, Laurel.

1098
01:22:57,606 --> 01:23:00,409
Laurel, what are you doing?

1099
01:23:00,443 --> 01:23:02,445
I want to hear what you have to say.

1100
01:23:16,525 --> 01:23:19,528
I want to hear all about the female perspective.

1101
01:23:32,808 --> 01:23:35,010
Stop please!

1102
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:40,049
- Ah!
- ( tires screech )

1103
01:23:47,223 --> 01:23:49,225
( horn blares )

1104
01:23:52,495 --> 01:23:56,199
( horn blaring )

1105
01:24:07,343 --> 01:24:09,812
Tell me about Patrick Costello.

1106
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:14,750
What do you mean?

1107
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:18,354
You like him, don't you?

1108
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:21,457
- ( cork pops )
- Yes.

1109
01:24:34,203 --> 01:24:36,305
Are you in love with him?

1110
01:24:38,274 --> 01:24:40,809
No.

1111
01:24:40,843 --> 01:24:43,812
You're not?

1112
01:24:43,846 --> 01:24:45,848
No.

1113
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,419
Good.

1114
01:24:58,594 --> 01:25:01,130
What are your feelings about me?

1115
01:25:10,273 --> 01:25:12,708
- Ted...
- No, wait.

1116
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:18,914
Do you, ahem...

1117
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:22,385
Do you think that you could love me?

1118
01:25:22,418 --> 01:25:24,387
( sighs )

1119
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:28,191
You know, this wine has
definitely gotten to my head.

1120
01:25:28,224 --> 01:25:29,692
I think I should go to bed.

1121
01:25:29,725 --> 01:25:33,196
- ( bottle breaks )
- Stay right here and answer me.

1122
01:25:34,363 --> 01:25:36,265
Damn it, answer me!

1123
01:25:36,299 --> 01:25:37,566
( glass breaks )

1124
01:25:46,275 --> 01:25:48,244
That wasn't nice, Laurel.

1125
01:25:48,277 --> 01:25:50,546
Come on.

1126
01:26:00,256 --> 01:26:02,591
- Stop, stop, please!
- ( tires screech )

1127
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:04,227
Uh!

1128
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:11,834
We've gotta get out of here.

1129
01:26:11,867 --> 01:26:13,869
Get in the car, quick.

1130
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:25,214
( engine sputtering )

1131
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:29,218
Ah!

1132
01:26:29,252 --> 01:26:31,754
- No!
- Leave us alone!

1133
01:26:31,787 --> 01:26:34,890
Laurel: No!

1134
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:36,825
Patrick!

1135
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:38,761
( screaming )

1136
01:26:38,794 --> 01:26:40,596
- Please help me.
- No!

1137
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:42,231
- Please! Please help me.
- No!

1138
01:26:42,265 --> 01:26:44,500
( grunts )

1139
01:27:09,892 --> 01:27:12,528
( gasps )

1140
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:14,797
( grunts )

1141
01:27:18,033 --> 01:27:20,569
( screams )

1142
01:27:32,415 --> 01:27:35,250
( honking horn )

1143
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,355
Patrick!

1144
01:27:40,856 --> 01:27:42,858
Ah!

1145
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:03,379
Patrick!

1146
01:28:04,513 --> 01:28:07,015
- Patrick!
- What?

1147
01:28:10,052 --> 01:28:11,654
You okay?

1148
01:28:11,687 --> 01:28:14,022
- Oh yeah, fine.
- Come on, sit over here.

1149
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:16,392
I almost got run over by a snowplow.

1150
01:28:16,425 --> 01:28:17,926
Never felt better.

1151
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:20,062
How are you? You okay?

1152
01:28:20,095 --> 01:28:22,064
Never felt better.

1153
01:28:22,097 --> 01:28:24,433
- Ah!
- Oh, sorry.

1154
01:28:24,467 --> 01:28:26,869
I gotta tell you something.

1155
01:28:26,902 --> 01:28:28,837
I hate Chinese food.

1156
01:28:28,871 --> 01:28:30,839
And you know that classical music?

1157
01:28:30,873 --> 01:28:32,575
- I hate that too.
- ( laughs )

1158
01:28:32,608 --> 01:28:36,712
Please don't make me listen to
that Bach guy anymore, okay?

1159
01:28:36,745 --> 01:28:38,747
Okay.
