1
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,084
- Room service.
- Come in.

2
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:46,889
- Where would you like it, sir?
- Oh, on the table there.

3
00:00:56,337 --> 00:00:57,337
Thank you, sir.

4
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:04,503
Thank you.

5
00:01:07,246 --> 00:01:09,600
- Thank you.
- Oh no, thank you.

6
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:51,928
Ok, let's shut him down.

7
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:59,307
- Ok, Ok, let's break it up.
- All right, bring it in.

8
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,374
Too much stress in areas HK3 and HK4.

9
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:09,025
There's an irregularity
in the electrical impulse.

10
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:12,198
Damn hand again.

11
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:24,476
How much further behind
does that put us, Doctor?

12
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,380
I don't know until I've
done a full analysis of him.

13
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:35,253
- Try an educated guess.
- I don't know. A couple of days, maybe.

14
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:45,407
Need I remind you, our budget
is up for review in seven weeks.

15
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:52,483
And need I have remind you, Dr Heller,
that if that hand in there can't play piano

16
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:54,580
without setting itself on fire.

17
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:59,438
We'll all be working at the corner
auto shop rebuilding transmissions.

18
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:09,467
Dr Simmons, Eve Vlll is being made
ready for a test run in lab number 4.

19
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, I love this jacket.
It's a wonderful jacket.

20
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:21,426
I think I need a purse, thank you.

21
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:25,698
Feels very good.

22
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:29,951
How do I look?

23
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:27,718
So, where are you from?

24
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,160
New York? Chicago?

25
00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:40,437
You look big city to me,
you know, classy. Right?

26
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:43,471
No.

27
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:50,558
But thanks for the compliment.

28
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,529
You staying here long?

29
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:04,903
No.

30
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:10,146
Quick in-and-out, eh?

31
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:33,034
This stop Embarcadero.
Embarcadero station this stop.

32
00:05:35,922 --> 00:05:42,402
This stop Embarcadero.
Embarcadero station this stop.

33
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:10,319
- Everybody freeze. On the floor.
- Freeze, asshole. On the floor.

34
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:17,215
- Get down, you want to wait for die?
- Help.

35
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,838
Down. Get down. Freeze. I said get down.

36
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:32,470
Lady, what's your problem?
Are you deaf? Kiss the fucking floor.

37
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:39,242
Hit the floor or you're dead.
You want to die? Are you stupid?

38
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:54,342
Fuck you, lady.

39
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:01,003
What the fuck?

40
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,670
OH, lets do it.

41
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:10,976
- Who are these guys?
- Come, everybody out.

42
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:15,489
All right, let's go. It's time to go. Come
on, move it, move it, move it, come on.

43
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,157
- Let's go.
- Look out, he's one of them.

44
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:27,271
Right, move out. Come on.

45
00:10:27,272 --> 00:10:30,596
- Come on, let's go, let's go.
- Move it, move out.

46
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,068
Hurry, hurry. Come on.

47
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:33,307
Go.

48
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,026
Hurry. Come on.

49
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:37,553
Come on, hurry. Get in there. Hurry.

50
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:49,895
Shit.

51
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,272
Line up.

52
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:18,872
- Let's go.
- Come on, Smith. Hurry up.

53
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:27,210
Webster, Harris, Des Moines, Saperstein...

54
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:31,311
Carter, you're all dead.

55
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:36,918
- Jesus.
- And each would have an epitaph...

56
00:11:37,234 --> 00:11:42,670
He died for his country
because he didn't fucking listen.

57
00:11:43,908 --> 00:11:49,029
You know, I wonder how many times I'm going
to have to tell you guys, you never relax.

58
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,379
You never let down your
guard, not for one second.

59
00:11:57,282 --> 00:12:02,816
Fix that up. Things are
not always what they seem.

60
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:13,223
So now, just to show you men
who's really God around here,

61
00:12:13,641 --> 00:12:17,436
I'm going to miraculously
bring you all back to life.

62
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,280
Poof.

63
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:24,789
So we try it again.
Only this time, we don't fuck up.

64
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:26,286
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

65
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:39,425
- What the fuck is that?
- Orders, sir.

66
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:42,944
To get the hell out of
here and onto that chopper.

67
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:47,115
What you do, pack for me?

68
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,639
- All right. Carter, take charge.
- Yes, sir.

69
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:58,396
Guess there's somebody
even bigger than God. Fall out.

70
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:30,454
- Mam, can we go over this.
- One second, Tim.

71
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:35,311
Tim, what are you doing? Hey.

72
00:13:37,472 --> 00:13:42,118
- Come on, let me see.
- This is a man. This is a woman.

73
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:45,955
- This is a vagina.
- What?

74
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:49,918
Mom, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.

75
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:52,372
You're right.

76
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,365
Hello.

77
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:04,843
No, I'm sorry. Dr Simmons cannot be disturbed.

78
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,022
- Those are tits.
- Who told you?

79
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:11,188
- Not Daddy, I swear.
- Tim, they're breasts.

80
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:14,324
- The other word is not nice, Ok?
- Ok, breasts.

81
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:17,606
- Do you know what those are called?
- Those?

82
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:23,185
- You tell me.
- Balls, Daddy tell me that.

83
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:27,732
- Dr Simmons, you have a telephone call.
- Maria, I told you no calls.

84
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:31,333
I'm sorry it's Dr Heller.
He says he must speak to you.

85
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:35,638
- We have to talk some more, young man.
- Ok.

86
00:14:42,546 --> 00:14:46,746
You'd better have a darn good
reason for calling me today. What?

87
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,482
Ok, Ok, I'll be there.

88
00:14:57,273 --> 00:14:59,994
Give me an hour. Yeah. Bye.

89
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:03,873
Oh, I have to go.

90
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:10,267
You'll have to take Timmy to
the airport, it's an emergency.

91
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:19,026
Maria will take you to the airport, Ok?
Now, I'll call you before you leave.

92
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:22,971
And Tim, we'll go to the
aquarium another time, I promise.

93
00:15:24,025 --> 00:15:28,064
I want a kiss. Oh, my sweetie.

94
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:32,647
Oh, and remember,
they're called testicles.

95
00:15:34,123 --> 00:15:35,055
Bye, sweetie.

96
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:10,545
Jim, this is Bill Schneider from the NSC.

97
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,813
- I've heard a lot about you, Colonel.
- Sir.

98
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:19,235
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

99
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:34,519
Look, I know you're pissed...

100
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:38,191
and it's understandable giving
all the hard work you've put in.

101
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:40,887
But this hostage crisis
is just going to have to wait.

102
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:44,851
Sir, we don't get those people out soon,
they're not coming out.

103
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:46,186
At least, not alive.

104
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:47,822
Colonel...

105
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:51,781
The hostages are no longer our top priority.

106
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:56,029
The plain fact is we
have a more pressing problem.

107
00:16:57,002 --> 00:17:01,603
Jim, you're about to be brought in
on this country's best-kept secret.

108
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:09,728
The following message
has the highest classification.

109
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:18,219
This is Project Rob, 25 years ago.

110
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:22,455
The aim was to design a robot
that could pass as human.

111
00:17:22,486 --> 00:17:26,553
As you can see, the state of
robotics then was very primitive.

112
00:17:32,273 --> 00:17:36,603
Today, this is Eve Vlll. State of the art.

113
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:42,427
To enable her to pass as
a convincing human being,

114
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:48,162
she has been programmed with the thoughts
and feelings of her inventor, Dr Eve Simmons.

115
00:17:48,931 --> 00:17:50,611
Please be aware...

116
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:55,087
Dr Simmons was also used as a model
for Eve Vlll's face and body structure

117
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,205
and her memory programs.

118
00:17:59,224 --> 00:18:01,462
Eve Vlll has been
designed for surveillance work

119
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:04,797
but can also be used
as a cover battlefield weapon.

120
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:10,467
Eve Vlll is currently completing a
series of test runs in the Bay Area.

121
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:11,413
Message ends.

122
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:21,777
- This thing for real?
- What do you mean?

123
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,352
Well I...

124
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:30,663
I knew we were doing some
robot research, but this thing is...

125
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:34,050
Is incredible.
Incredible is not a strong enough word, sir.

126
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:36,918
Incredible is not
a strong enough word, sir.

127
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:06,065
She was on a test run in the
bay area this morning.

128
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:09,232
These were taken by the
bank's security cameras.

129
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:12,732
As you can see, Eve Vlll got herself shot.

130
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:18,033
The point is, when she was shot...

131
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:22,729
somehow and we have no idea,
screwed up her internal workings.

132
00:19:23,382 --> 00:19:26,986
- Now she's on the loose.
- And armed.

133
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:28,974
Oh, and armed, you bet.

134
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:34,840
Ok, so let me ask some
maybe stupid questions here.

135
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,443
You know where she is now?

136
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:42,595
No, our trace on her was knocked out
at the time of the shooting.

137
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:46,930
- So there's no way to communicate with her?
- That's affirmative.

138
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,773
When we eventually do find her,
how do we switch her off?

139
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,573
It's not as simple as that, colonel.
She's more human than machine.

140
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:58,174
See, she's just like a regular soldier.

141
00:19:59,004 --> 00:20:02,338
You give her instructions
and she carries them out.

142
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:04,432
How dangerous is she?

143
00:20:05,874 --> 00:20:10,208
She could be highly dangerous
if she's locked in battlefield mode.

144
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,321
What's that?

145
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,838
Battlefield mode
is Eve Vlll highest state of readiness.

146
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:23,638
It's mean, she's a split second away
from using force to protect herself...

147
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,373
from what she perceives as terminal harm.

148
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:31,568
So I guess that means she's no longer in the
mood to accept orders from a superior officer?

149
00:20:31,569 --> 00:20:32,569
That's correct.

150
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,743
Well, this is quite some toy you have
yourself here, gentleman.

151
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:40,600
I suppose you want me
to put it back in its box?

152
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:42,267
It's not a toy, Colonel.

153
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:19,553
Dr Simmons, I'm glad you
could come at short notice.

154
00:21:19,554 --> 00:21:23,768
- I was offered little choice, general.
- Bill Schneider you know.

155
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:25,969
This is Jim McQuade. Eve Simmons.

156
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:32,365
- Something wrong?
- No, you just look kind of familiar.

157
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:37,631
- Don't worry, she's quite human.
- That's not what my staff say, General.

158
00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:55,346
Jim is been briefed on the situation, I hope
you two will be able to work together on this.

159
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,976
Doctor, I'm told that Eve Vlll is been

160
00:21:57,977 --> 00:22:01,311
programmed with a lot
of your own life experiences.

161
00:22:01,556 --> 00:22:04,156
Does that mean you think exactly alike?

162
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:12,861
Yes, she was programmed with much of my life
experience, but we're not exactly alike. No.

163
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:20,325
Just exactly what are
your qualifications, Mr McQuade?

164
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:22,359
What's your specialty?

165
00:22:25,522 --> 00:22:29,856
Well, to tell the truth Doctor,
my specialty is a spinach lasagne.

166
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,881
In a very light tomato and basil sauce.

167
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:40,147
Actually Doctor, Mr McQuade is highly trained
and fairly knowledgeable in all aspects...

168
00:22:40,148 --> 00:22:42,882
of counter-insurgency and anti-terrorism.

169
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:46,735
He's our very best field man.
He will neutralize Eve Vlll.

170
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:50,789
So your specialty is killing.

171
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,867
Which brings me to my next question,
Doctor, how do I kill this thing?

172
00:22:56,868 --> 00:23:02,467
One seriously wounded and a customer, also
believed wounded, mysteriously disappeared

173
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:06,803
after overpowering one of the robbers.
This just in...

174
00:23:45,286 --> 00:23:50,743
Her areas of vulnerability naturally are
approximate to those of a real human.

175
00:23:52,047 --> 00:23:57,112
All the motor signals that control her limbs
come down the backbone which...

176
00:23:57,142 --> 00:23:59,276
has a strong protective coating.

177
00:24:04,871 --> 00:24:10,540
- What's that cylinder?
- That's just part of her protection.

178
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:19,597
Ok, what about the heart?
Will a bullet there stop her?

179
00:24:20,191 --> 00:24:24,841
No, her heart, in fact her
whole blood system is cosmetic.

180
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:30,005
They're designed to let her medically pass
as human but have no real function.

181
00:24:30,328 --> 00:24:33,629
It's tiny electrical currents that power her.

182
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:37,261
She'll bleed but she won't die.

183
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:41,473
So upper or lower
body are not good for a kill?

184
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,930
Correct.

185
00:24:44,988 --> 00:24:51,202
The skull is very protected.
A good place to aim would be right or left eyes.

186
00:24:51,939 --> 00:24:54,385
Those are both vulnerable areas.

187
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,430
A bullet through either eye
should terminate all motor activity.

188
00:25:04,832 --> 00:25:07,366
I guess the eyes have it then, eh doc?

189
00:25:47,635 --> 00:25:50,509
Your call sight Seeker. We'll be Homer.

190
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:54,110
We're also getting a chopper
with civilian markings.

191
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:58,818
Now, as far as the rest of the world is
concerned and that include press and police,

192
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:03,265
we'll simply be searching
for a dangerous female terrorist.

193
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:09,698
This will tell you if we're
dealing with the unthinkable.

194
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:14,994
If she goes nuclear,
you'll hear a high-pitched tone.

195
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,167
- He doesn't know?
- He doesn't need to.

196
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:21,635
The less people who know, the better.

197
00:26:22,557 --> 00:26:23,671
Don't worry.

198
00:26:24,287 --> 00:26:27,238
I'm told he's our very best
marksman, he's been fully briefed.

199
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:28,773
He'll aim for the eyes.

200
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:48,720
Sir, Eve Vlll's rented herself a car in
the Bay Area, a red 1990 Mustang.

201
00:26:49,012 --> 00:26:52,371
She's also got herself
250 rounds of ammunition.

202
00:26:56,231 --> 00:27:02,431
This say, she also specifically requested and
was given a detailed map of Northern California.

203
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:31,674
Pink lady.

204
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,545
Pink lady.

205
00:27:54,566 --> 00:27:55,945
That's nice.

206
00:28:00,501 --> 00:28:04,167
- That's very nice.
- Very nice.

207
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,267
- Hey, Cal. Don't go getting greedy on us.
- Don't worry.

208
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,673
The same old line,
One for all and all for one.

209
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:29,190
Go to it, man.

210
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:44,932
What are you looking for?

211
00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:49,440
Maybe I can help?

212
00:28:57,906 --> 00:29:01,032
Get it while you can, Janis Joplin.

213
00:29:02,546 --> 00:29:07,284
Janis Joplin?
Not on this machine, darling.

214
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:11,731
Dear Janis was dead
before this box was even built.

215
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:20,216
What you say you
and me step into the 90s?

216
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:42,214
Why don't we just go
and take a room, eh?

217
00:29:44,605 --> 00:29:47,005
♪ Something you might want to know ♪

218
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:57,509
♪ Every time I see your face.
Oh, this feeling grows ♪

219
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:06,705
♪ I've been watching you for some time now
I know you've seen me too ♪

220
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:19,273
Sir, we're going to sweep to the
right and head north on US-1.

221
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:21,113
Roger. Copy that.

222
00:30:25,644 --> 00:30:29,644
So Doctor, will start telling me
a little bit about yourself?

223
00:30:30,155 --> 00:30:32,104
See, because I figure
the more I know about you,

224
00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:35,699
the better my chances of
catching up with your mechanical double.

225
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,354
- Didn't you read my file?
- I read your file.

226
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:42,445
You're 33 years old...

227
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:46,959
you got a five-year-old son lives in
New York with his father, your ex-husband.

228
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,219
A former UN diplomat turned
writer, journalism mostly.

229
00:30:51,578 --> 00:30:54,418
You probably have more qualifications
and letters behind your name...

230
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,618
than our friend the
general got ribbons on his chest.

231
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:02,286
But, that hardly gets me to first base
with what I'm dealing with here.

232
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:05,622
What about your file, Mr McQuade?

233
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:12,149
My file is classified, but then you don't
need to read my file to know I'm a great guy.

234
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,721
So you're the guy the government calls
when they don't want congress to know.

235
00:31:16,722 --> 00:31:17,791
Sometimes.

236
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:22,224
Don't get me wrong, I'm not
some crazy right-wing extremist.

237
00:31:22,226 --> 00:31:26,493
- So what do you believe in?
- Me, I believe in a strong defense.

238
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:29,867
I also believe we should show a little bit
more backbone when dealing with some...

239
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:34,168
Of the evils of this world,
international terrorism been the primary.

240
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:39,464
Also, automated bank tellers,
junk mail and cars that talk back to.

241
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:41,946
They don't like machines.

242
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:45,314
Is that why you seem to
have contempt for what I do?

243
00:31:45,315 --> 00:31:50,601
- It's not contempt. It's disbelief.
- Disbelief?

244
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,715
I find it incredible that
someone as clever as yourself

245
00:31:53,716 --> 00:31:58,088
spends billions of the taxpayers
dollars, years of hard work,

246
00:31:58,352 --> 00:32:03,152
and you come up with something that
don't even have a fucking off-switch.

247
00:32:30,986 --> 00:32:33,720
It's a little late to get cold, isn't it?

248
00:32:37,886 --> 00:32:39,013
Excuse me.

249
00:32:40,897 --> 00:32:42,374
You want your pearls?

250
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:53,063
Come here.

251
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,266
Come on.

252
00:33:08,882 --> 00:33:12,807
Come here. Come on.

253
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,210
You want to play?

254
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:23,495
Come on. Show me how you play.

255
00:33:26,818 --> 00:33:28,315
Easy.

256
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:32,872
Nice. Nice.

257
00:34:03,734 --> 00:34:08,335
This is Napa 372. We found that
Mustang, will you send us some backup.

258
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:31,836
Now for the big surprise.

259
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:45,419
Come on, it's not a gun.

260
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,516
Come on. Come on.

261
00:34:52,545 --> 00:34:54,545
Say hello.

262
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:05,398
Come to me.

263
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:14,888
- Come on, you bitch.
- Please, don't say that.

264
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:19,470
- Oh, no?
- I'm very sensitive.

265
00:35:23,548 --> 00:35:28,045
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you were a sensitive bitch.

266
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,308
Cal?

267
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,636
You little bitch.

268
00:36:31,017 --> 00:36:33,104
Come on up, get up.

269
00:36:33,886 --> 00:36:37,965
- That bitch is crazy, that bitch is crazy.
- Where is she? Which room she in?

270
00:36:37,966 --> 00:36:41,003
- I don't know.
- Which room she in?

271
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:44,344
- Put him in that car right there.
- Jack.

272
00:36:46,366 --> 00:36:50,085
No. No. Let me go.

273
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:51,577
Easy.

274
00:37:08,544 --> 00:37:09,855
Freeze.

275
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:13,399
Freeze.

276
00:37:16,555 --> 00:37:18,788
Show us your hands, lady.

277
00:37:21,482 --> 00:37:22,987
Show us your hands.

278
00:38:29,453 --> 00:38:33,187
The motel is ten miles north
of Hopland, just off US-101.

279
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:35,434
How many dead, Homer?

280
00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:40,125
Five. It's five cops, Jim.

281
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:55,745
- God.
- Stay right here. I'll deal with this.

282
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:59,836
We don't want to confuse these people.

283
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:26,454
Take it easy, friend.

284
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:34,468
You must be the Fed they're
squawking about, McCall?

285
00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:36,354
- McQuade.
- Yeah, whatever.

286
00:39:36,846 --> 00:39:39,577
I ain't had more than one shooting
here in the last three years

287
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:43,228
and that was a clown that went
shot himself in the foot.

288
00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:46,336
Now I got myself a fucking war zone.

289
00:40:13,855 --> 00:40:17,084
You know, I want to know
why some broader comes here,

290
00:40:17,085 --> 00:40:19,287
brush away a bunch of my people.

291
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:21,480
And suddenly it's out of my jurisdiction.

292
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:23,992
- Captain, I understand how you...
- What are you doing, man?

293
00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:28,393
Maybe you'd like to explain that
to the families of those troopers?

294
00:40:29,558 --> 00:40:31,480
Excuse me.

295
00:40:34,763 --> 00:40:38,779
- Homer. This is Seeker.
- Go ahead, Seeker.

296
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:43,131
It's not good sir, looks
like a bad night in West Beirut.

297
00:40:43,161 --> 00:40:45,949
This thing is going to take some stopping.

298
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:49,617
Plus we have our friends
from the media crawling around.

299
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:53,076
This one is not going to go away quietly, sir.

300
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:56,193
Look, we got to bring in
more firepower to stop this thing.

301
00:40:56,194 --> 00:40:59,920
Our story stands, general.
This is got to be low profile.

302
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:02,188
That's what Washington wants, sir.

303
00:41:02,282 --> 00:41:04,282
Ok Ruby, I need a description.

304
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:08,806
Ok, she was blonde, curly blonde hair.

305
00:41:08,943 --> 00:41:12,927
Wearing a tight black dress,
red leather jacket with zippers on.

306
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:16,770
- How tall?
- Five six, five seven, something like that.

307
00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:20,552
Yeah, she made it real plain what she
was after as soon as she walk in the door..

308
00:41:20,553 --> 00:41:21,343
What was that?

309
00:41:21,373 --> 00:41:24,373
She was looking to
get laid, plain and simple.

310
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,444
Ok Ruby, let's go over it one more time.

311
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:40,763
- Didn't I say stay put?
- I know this place.

312
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:44,317
- Been here before?
- Not exactly but I know it.

313
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:51,065
- I think I know why she came here.
- Let's find someplace we can talk.

314
00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:53,629
- Ok guys, in here.
- Right behind you.

315
00:41:58,784 --> 00:42:02,182
Come here, we talk in here.

316
00:42:16,893 --> 00:42:18,893
I lived near here for a while.

317
00:42:20,252 --> 00:42:23,519
My friends and I drove
by this place all the time.

318
00:42:26,077 --> 00:42:28,611
We never had the guts to come in here.

319
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:33,825
It's the local hooker joint.

320
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:43,824
But I...

321
00:42:45,242 --> 00:42:50,368
- I used to imagine what it might be like.
- What what might be like?

322
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,524
What are you trying to say? What?

323
00:42:55,946 --> 00:42:57,223
What?

324
00:42:59,264 --> 00:43:02,991
I think Eve Vlll may have acted
out some kind of fantasy.

325
00:43:02,992 --> 00:43:04,127
That's what I'm trying to say.

326
00:43:04,128 --> 00:43:06,980
Now, wait a minute,
let me get this thing straight.

327
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:12,511
You're saying this device of yours acted
out one of your teenage sex fantasies?

328
00:43:14,163 --> 00:43:15,013
Yes.

329
00:43:16,921 --> 00:43:18,655
Incredible as it may seem.

330
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,265
Incredible is not a strong enough word, Doctor.

331
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:30,304
So this device of yours is horny
as well as psychopathic, eh?

332
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,950
It's quite a combination in a woman.

333
00:43:32,951 --> 00:43:35,116
Look Doctor, what would you do

334
00:43:35,146 --> 00:43:39,343
if you were her, seeing that you she
seem to be her and she seem to be you?

335
00:43:39,344 --> 00:43:41,880
I don't know what she's
going to do next, Ok?

336
00:43:41,881 --> 00:43:43,990
I can only give you some
clues after the event.

337
00:43:43,991 --> 00:43:48,219
Yeah, well there might be a few
more events before she's through here.

338
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,512
Get out, get out.
Get the fuck out, get out..

339
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:54,345
Shit.

340
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:05,151
It's not going to help you
getting uptight with me, McQuade.

341
00:44:08,788 --> 00:44:13,519
You have to realize this is my
life's work and is all going to waste.

342
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:16,134
Ok, Ok.

343
00:44:18,427 --> 00:44:23,052
- Where were you born?
- In Santa Rosa.

344
00:44:24,024 --> 00:44:30,237
I went to high school near here,
in Ukiah. I moved around a lot.

345
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:34,174
- Where your parents?
- My mother is dead.

346
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,923
- Your father?
- I don't know.

347
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:37,302
What you mean, you don't know?
Where's your father?

348
00:44:37,303 --> 00:44:38,582
I don't know.

349
00:44:39,925 --> 00:44:44,639
My mother died when I was six years old and
I went to live with my grandparents in Europe.

350
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,565
I didn't come back until I was 16.

351
00:44:49,947 --> 00:44:51,952
Haven't spoken with my father in years.

352
00:44:51,953 --> 00:44:55,034
He used to live in Gunerneville.
I have no idea where he is now.

353
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:59,904
- What's his name?
- Bill, Bill Simmons.

354
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:04,910
Have you got any other teenage
fantasies I should know about?

355
00:45:05,072 --> 00:45:07,528
- What?
- Oh, shit.

356
00:45:08,194 --> 00:45:13,194
I said, have you got any other teenage
sexual fantasies I should know about?

357
00:45:13,893 --> 00:45:14,775
God.

358
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:18,780
Am I supposed to put myself for
analysis with some guy who's

359
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:21,748
probably never read anything more
complex than an army field manual?

360
00:45:21,749 --> 00:45:23,443
Oh, get over it, lady.

361
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:28,234
Look, there's five dead cops out there
thanks to your surveillance device.

362
00:45:28,235 --> 00:45:32,521
And along with that comes grieving
widows and their fatherless children.

363
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:35,389
And I don't think all that pain and loss

364
00:45:35,419 --> 00:45:39,362
can compare to any embarrassment that you
might feel because you got to talk to me.

365
00:45:39,363 --> 00:45:41,289
And you got to talk to me.

366
00:45:48,009 --> 00:45:50,810
Look, we got to work together on this, Ok?

367
00:45:51,612 --> 00:45:53,634
I want the names of all the places you lived,

368
00:45:53,635 --> 00:45:59,711
all the schools you went to, friends, enemies,
acquaintances, good memories and bad.

369
00:46:00,277 --> 00:46:02,947
And I want the names
of your favorite television programs,

370
00:46:02,948 --> 00:46:07,481
your favorite food and,
if necessary, how you like it done to you.

371
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:26,835
We think Eve Vlll may visit
some of her inventor's old haunts.

372
00:46:26,836 --> 00:46:29,306
I have a list of these places, Homer.

373
00:46:29,681 --> 00:46:32,724
Think we should get on
stake out of some of these locations.

374
00:46:32,725 --> 00:46:34,428
Copy that, Seeker.

375
00:46:35,185 --> 00:46:40,355
Also, I want you to check the whereabouts
of one Bill, as in William, Simmons.

376
00:46:40,988 --> 00:46:44,616
Used to live at 2331 South Harper, Gunerneville.

377
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,574
We also knows he served as an army
engineer in Germany, back in the 60s.

378
00:46:51,485 --> 00:46:55,019
- Sir, we need put back to refuel.
- Roger, copy that.

379
00:47:18,378 --> 00:47:19,738
Damn.

380
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:49,585
Fuck you, don't touch me, lady.

381
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:54,636
You aren't going to get
nothing in the car, I'm sick.

382
00:47:55,845 --> 00:47:58,113
Please no, please no.

383
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:02,907
I'm sick and tired of hearing
you griping all the time.

384
00:48:02,908 --> 00:48:04,806
Daddy...

385
00:48:04,836 --> 00:48:05,796
Stop it. No.

386
00:48:05,797 --> 00:48:08,864
What the hell are
you looking at, little bitch?

387
00:48:16,964 --> 00:48:17,839
Come on.

388
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:23,248
Come on, get out of the way.

389
00:48:32,275 --> 00:48:35,897
It's great, never fucking
get there. Come on, lady.

390
00:48:45,537 --> 00:48:46,625
Fuck.

391
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:57,802
Hey lady, what is your
fucking problem? Stupid bitch.

392
00:49:04,531 --> 00:49:07,262
There you go, lady.
Think about that one.

393
00:49:22,116 --> 00:49:25,193
You just shut up and listen to me a second.
You and I made a deal, right?

394
00:49:25,194 --> 00:49:29,329
Don't fuck with me like this. It's
business, business are business Charlie.

395
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:32,464
Friendship had nothing
to do with it, all right?

396
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,449
No listen, shut up a minute,
will you? And listen to me.

397
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:40,317
Are you with the program or you're
not with the program. Now, which is it?

398
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:45,411
And when I get in I want everybody
smiling, spit polished, All right?

399
00:49:46,626 --> 00:49:47,807
What the...?

400
00:49:49,331 --> 00:49:50,513
Wait.

401
00:49:53,964 --> 00:49:55,022
Shit.

402
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:05,733
God.

403
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:31,796
Jesus Christ, she got a short fucking fuse.

404
00:50:39,967 --> 00:50:40,925
Jesus.

405
00:51:16,802 --> 00:51:19,775
- What's that?
- Oh, my God.

406
00:51:20,086 --> 00:51:21,582
What the fuck is that?

407
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:25,902
- She is activated.
- Activated? What do you mean, activated?

408
00:51:25,903 --> 00:51:28,499
- I need the radio.
- What do you mean is activated?

409
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,764
I need that radio.

410
00:51:31,047 --> 00:51:34,917
Homer, this is Seeker. Come in, please.

411
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:41,614
- Homer, this is Seeker. Do you hear me?
- Seeker, this is Homer.

412
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:47,095
Target appears to be activated.
Repeat. Target appears to be activated.

413
00:51:48,059 --> 00:51:51,354
What the hell is going on?
How the hell this happened?

414
00:51:51,355 --> 00:51:55,222
We don't know. It appears
target sustained a severe impact.

415
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:58,320
She's put herself on a 24-hour clock.

416
00:52:15,953 --> 00:52:20,052
Well, listen...

417
00:52:22,087 --> 00:52:25,741
She's a battlefield
nuclear weapon, McQuade.

418
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:29,525
She's designed to
be deployed in hostile countries.

419
00:52:29,526 --> 00:52:32,860
She's our answer to their space shield.

420
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:40,554
And if we don't find
her in the next 24 hours.

421
00:52:40,584 --> 00:52:45,777
She'll explode with enough
force to take out 20 to 30 city blocks.

422
00:52:48,388 --> 00:52:53,201
Your superiors thought
there was no need for you to know.

423
00:52:54,157 --> 00:52:57,691
I was following my orders
like you're following yours.

424
00:53:01,384 --> 00:53:05,603
She can only be activated by a complex
series of pre-arranged signals.

425
00:53:05,604 --> 00:53:07,791
She's designed to be fail-safe.

426
00:53:10,675 --> 00:53:14,440
You people are too much, you know that?

427
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:17,921
I mean, you really do think you're God.

428
00:53:19,419 --> 00:53:24,134
Except that, when God created his Eve,
he did it to shake us up a little bit.

429
00:53:24,135 --> 00:53:28,935
Now you've gone one better and
designed her to blow us all the fuck away.

430
00:53:30,572 --> 00:53:31,535
May I?

431
00:53:39,188 --> 00:53:42,225
- Homer, this is Seeker.
- Come in, Seeker.

432
00:53:42,546 --> 00:53:47,080
Homer, just got some real interesting
news from the good doctor here.

433
00:53:48,215 --> 00:53:50,949
You want to bring me up to speed on this?

434
00:54:05,726 --> 00:54:07,066
You Ok, lady?

435
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:14,231
- I need your jeep.
- Well, you can't have my jeep.

436
00:54:33,654 --> 00:54:37,158
Sir, Napa County Sheriffs have just
given us a location for a traffic accident.

437
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:43,758
Grid coordinates are Echo Golf
Niner Niner 45432. End transmission.

438
00:54:44,607 --> 00:54:49,492
Seeker, we have a report of a jeep
being stolen a mile north crash site.

439
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,735
The owner was severely beaten.

440
00:54:51,736 --> 00:54:58,806
Jeep is color red,
California license 2PX S822.

441
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,080
Yes, I'd like to speak to
the owner, Mr Victor Montoya.

442
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,107
Have an address for Bill Simmons:
29 Tompkins Lane, St Helena.

443
00:56:04,316 --> 00:56:07,850
State police have been notified.
Backup is on its way.

444
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,606
Hello, Dad.

445
00:56:40,762 --> 00:56:42,436
How did you find me?

446
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:47,995
Victor Montoya.

447
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:55,398
Victor Montoya, you know Victor?

448
00:56:56,661 --> 00:57:00,131
Yes. He said, say hi.

449
00:57:01,364 --> 00:57:06,685
I didn't know you've know Victor,
that's quite a memory you've got.

450
00:57:07,874 --> 00:57:13,602
Well, then, I guess you'd better, come in.

451
00:57:18,141 --> 00:57:23,208
Oh, there you are. Bill Kleinow.
We set up a briefing for you. Come this way.

452
00:57:25,932 --> 00:57:28,165
Well, that's 29 Tompkins Lane.

453
00:57:28,369 --> 00:57:31,756
The red jeep report stolen from
Russian Gulch is parked in the driveway.

454
00:57:31,757 --> 00:57:34,905
- The householder's name is Simpson.
- You mean Simmons, right?

455
00:57:34,906 --> 00:57:36,734
All right, the neighbors thought Simpson.

456
00:57:36,735 --> 00:57:40,087
Now, they could be wrong,
apparently the guy is some kind of recluse.

457
00:57:40,088 --> 00:57:43,594
- Well, that sounds right.
- Where's your man?

458
00:57:44,332 --> 00:57:46,380
At the end of the
street, but I can get him to...

459
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:50,648
No, just tell him to stay out of
sight, this is my show, Captain.

460
00:57:53,408 --> 00:57:56,742
- Who the hell are these guys?
- Your new deputies.

461
00:57:57,881 --> 00:58:03,480
Listen, if this thing gets away from us we
may need to create some plausible deniability.

462
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:06,124
Perhaps you guys at Langley
could help us out on this.

463
00:58:06,125 --> 00:58:07,925
Yeah, what you got in mind?

464
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:14,085
A little diversionary blame. Perhaps the Iraqis
or Libyans, whoever is top of your shit list.

465
00:58:22,968 --> 00:58:26,968
- You recognise this place?
- Never seen it before.

466
00:58:29,351 --> 00:58:31,485
- Lieutenant.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

467
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:35,589
- Sir?
- If she gets past me, hold your fire.

468
00:58:35,861 --> 00:58:40,745
If she fires at you, take cover. Do not,
I'll repeat, do not fire back, understood?

469
00:58:40,746 --> 00:58:42,161
- But sir...
- Understood?

470
00:58:42,162 --> 00:58:43,012
Yes, sir.

471
00:58:43,612 --> 00:58:47,557
Your job lieutenant, is to keep
track of her, not take her out.

472
00:58:47,558 --> 00:58:48,892
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

473
00:58:50,431 --> 00:58:54,345
If things don't go my way you start
talking to General Curtis at the proceed.

474
00:58:54,346 --> 00:58:58,124
- The call sign is Homer, you got it?
- Yes, sir.

475
00:58:58,283 --> 00:59:01,617
Right, that ought to get
you through. Open channel.

476
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:19,120
It's Ok., lie still. Lie still.

477
01:01:22,906 --> 01:01:24,731
Homer, this is Seeker.

478
01:01:39,766 --> 01:01:41,410
Seeker, this is Homer.

479
01:01:42,086 --> 01:01:46,458
Seeker, this is Homer.
Come in Seeker. Seeker, do you copy?

480
01:01:47,332 --> 01:01:48,963
Seeker, this is Homer.

481
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:53,485
Homer, this is Frankel,
what you want me to do, sir?

482
01:01:53,486 --> 01:01:56,953
You have your orders, lieutenant.
Stay where you are.

483
01:02:02,069 --> 01:02:06,108
I saw you. I saw what you did.

484
01:02:08,438 --> 01:02:12,474
What you see me do, Eve? Eh? What I do?

485
01:02:13,409 --> 01:02:17,215
I saw you. I saw what you did.

486
01:02:19,254 --> 01:02:20,962
I saw what happened.

487
01:02:22,866 --> 01:02:25,667
What did I do, Eve?
What did you see me do?

488
01:02:28,186 --> 01:02:32,225
- I saw you.
- Eve. Don't.

489
01:02:32,926 --> 01:02:37,274
Don't do it. He didn't kill her.
It wasn't him.

490
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:44,284
Ma'am. Shit.

491
01:02:44,634 --> 01:02:48,768
- Are we going in, sir?
- Stay right here, soldier. Right here.

492
01:02:50,187 --> 01:02:53,826
He didn't do it, Eve.
He didn't kill her. It wasn't him.

493
01:02:53,827 --> 01:02:54,907
I saw you.

494
01:03:00,066 --> 01:03:01,811
I saw what happened.

495
01:03:02,393 --> 01:03:05,461
Eve, can you hear me?

496
01:03:06,146 --> 01:03:11,379
Eve, listen to me.
He didn't kill her. It wasn't him.

497
01:03:12,746 --> 01:03:15,752
Eve, do you hear me?

498
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:31,937
Eve?

499
01:03:35,052 --> 01:03:36,222
Eve?

500
01:03:41,653 --> 01:03:46,081
Eve, it's Ok.
He's your friend Eve, don't harm him.

501
01:03:49,828 --> 01:03:54,119
Eve please, don't harm him.

502
01:04:01,169 --> 01:04:02,586
Oh, my God.

503
01:04:06,547 --> 01:04:08,741
Eve, don't.

504
01:04:13,596 --> 01:04:16,548
Get out. Get out.

505
01:04:19,852 --> 01:04:22,124
Seeker, this is Homer.

506
01:04:25,659 --> 01:04:27,726
Jim, goddamn it, where are you?

507
01:04:36,474 --> 01:04:40,454
Seeker, this is Homer.
Come in Seeker. Come in Seeker.

508
01:04:40,484 --> 01:04:43,542
- Yeah, I'm Ok.
- Outside.

509
01:04:47,531 --> 01:04:52,465
Yes sir, I'm Ok. But we've got three
dead marines and a dead civilian here.

510
01:04:53,795 --> 01:04:59,300
The target is still at large, repeat.
Target is still at large. Seeker out.

511
01:05:07,121 --> 01:05:09,781
Your boy fucked up, General.

512
01:05:12,267 --> 01:05:15,568
We had her. Fucking had her.

513
01:05:21,763 --> 01:05:26,897
Eagle, this is Seeker. I need you to
make a sweep north of the Simmons' place.

514
01:05:27,303 --> 01:05:28,794
Copy that, Seeker.

515
01:06:04,522 --> 01:06:08,466
What did you mean when you said
I didn't kill her? Kill who?

516
01:06:13,568 --> 01:06:17,368
The truth is, I've kept it
hidden away for so long that...

517
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:21,082
now I've begun to wonder
if it ever really happened.

518
01:06:22,968 --> 01:06:25,570
- Bill, please.
- Don't touch me.

519
01:06:30,538 --> 01:06:33,883
I was five, almost six years old.

520
01:06:36,967 --> 01:06:39,126
It was raining hard that day.

521
01:06:40,365 --> 01:06:44,699
We'd gone to pick up my father.
He'd been drinking at a local bar.

522
01:06:46,306 --> 01:06:48,173
He liked to drink sometimes.

523
01:06:48,849 --> 01:06:51,471
I'm not going to calm down.

524
01:06:54,442 --> 01:06:58,092
That day he was very
drunk, too drunk to drive.

525
01:07:02,228 --> 01:07:06,495
Get very angry when my mother
wouldn't let him have the car keys.

526
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:16,247
They were out of the car,
arguing by the side of a busy road.

527
01:07:17,669 --> 01:07:21,381
- Come over here, give me the keys.
- Get in. I'll drive you home.

528
01:07:21,382 --> 01:07:25,116
You aren't going to get
nothing get in the car. I'm sick.

529
01:07:25,556 --> 01:07:27,862
- Give me the keys, you bitch.
- Don't call me a bitch.

530
01:07:27,863 --> 01:07:30,410
Go if you want to drive one,
bitch, now give me the goddamn keys.

531
01:07:30,411 --> 01:07:33,750
- But you're drunk.
- I'm not drunk, I'm happy.

532
01:07:33,891 --> 01:07:39,758
Don't give me any more shit about, give me
the damn keys, bitch. I've had enough of this.

533
01:07:41,676 --> 01:07:43,604
Get out of my face, bitch.

534
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:52,186
- Jesus, Jesus, Catherine.
- What happened?

535
01:07:52,373 --> 01:07:55,357
I don't know. She just ran out.

536
01:07:55,527 --> 01:07:58,758
Catherine, talk to me.

537
01:08:03,694 --> 01:08:06,539
Fell or pushed or slipped, he was guilty.

538
01:08:09,136 --> 01:08:13,203
He'd been killing her for years
and now he'd done it for ever.

539
01:08:18,402 --> 01:08:20,470
We hardly spoke after she died.

540
01:08:23,175 --> 01:08:28,757
Time didn't improve things.
I got more angry about what had happened.

541
01:08:45,613 --> 01:08:47,613
Where you think she'll go now?

542
01:08:52,385 --> 01:08:58,089
- I think she'll go to New York next.
- New York? Why New York?

543
01:08:59,488 --> 01:09:01,390
To see Timmy, my son.

544
01:09:02,747 --> 01:09:07,410
- You're sure about New York?
- I know what she's doing now.

545
01:09:08,885 --> 01:09:12,626
It sounds crazy but she's
going back through my life.

546
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:16,652
Only there are no barriers, no stop signs.

547
01:09:19,486 --> 01:09:23,420
Whatever damage she sustained
destroyed all her inhibitions.

548
01:09:25,889 --> 01:09:30,756
She's doing things I might think about
doing but would never dare to do...

549
01:09:31,248 --> 01:09:33,656
or have the courage to do.

550
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:37,108
We got to be right about New York.

551
01:09:37,287 --> 01:09:39,102
Otherwise we're going to be in the wrong place

552
01:09:39,103 --> 01:09:43,170
at the wrong time and a
lot of innocent people are going to die.

553
01:09:43,171 --> 01:09:47,111
Wait, what really matters to me
is to be a good mother for Timmy.

554
01:09:47,112 --> 01:09:51,520
And I know that's what she's feeling right
now, she'll go to New York to get my son.

555
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:55,121
- I got to be sure that...
- McQuade, I know I'm right.

556
01:10:03,791 --> 01:10:07,771
We've dispatched hit teams
to La Guardia, JFK and Newark.

557
01:10:08,198 --> 01:10:09,800
Do we know what flight she's on?

558
01:10:09,801 --> 01:10:13,001
We're checking sir, there's
lots of permutations.

559
01:10:13,305 --> 01:10:15,418
I'm afraid, gentleman,
it's true confessions time.

560
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:19,833
The president will have to be told, the
New York mayor's office have to be alerted,

561
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:23,034
so they can put evacuation plans into operation.

562
01:10:23,345 --> 01:10:25,679
Look, you got to give us more time.

563
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:30,028
If we shock-up the streets with thousands
of panicked residents we'll never get her.

564
01:10:30,029 --> 01:10:32,963
The general is right
sir, it's do or die now.

565
01:10:34,087 --> 01:10:36,631
Jesus, then do it.

566
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:46,015
Seeker, Eve Vlll may had
a few hours head-start on us,

567
01:10:46,016 --> 01:10:49,350
But we will have surveillance
in place in New York.

568
01:10:53,648 --> 01:10:57,628
- This must all be routine for you.
- What's routine?

569
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,512
Dead bodies, people getting killed.

570
01:11:03,298 --> 01:11:08,328
I've seen a lot of my friends put
in plastic bags and shipped home.

571
01:11:09,862 --> 01:11:11,201
It's not routine.

572
01:11:18,445 --> 01:11:21,027
Look, look, we believe in something.

573
01:11:22,085 --> 01:11:26,686
We do what we do because we think
it'll help people, maybe stop a war.

574
01:11:27,005 --> 01:11:28,969
We don't set out to destroy.

575
01:11:29,706 --> 01:11:33,906
We set out to preserve a way
of life that we think is important.

576
01:11:34,969 --> 01:11:37,152
The point is your intentions are good...

577
01:11:37,153 --> 01:11:40,820
even if you did forget to
put in the fucking off-switch.

578
01:11:46,619 --> 01:11:48,056
Thanks, McQuade.

579
01:11:51,376 --> 01:11:52,386
Jim.

580
01:11:55,388 --> 01:11:59,989
Eve, I hope you know I'll do everything
possible not to harm your son.

581
01:12:00,329 --> 01:12:03,996
- But this may come down to some hard choices.
- I know.

582
01:13:00,865 --> 01:13:02,532
What the hell he's doing?

583
01:13:03,351 --> 01:13:06,551
I think he's learning
Russian or some damn thing.

584
01:13:09,763 --> 01:13:13,030
Shouldn't we get the husband
and kid out of there?

585
01:13:14,789 --> 01:13:17,056
If we move them, she may not show.

586
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:29,103
Unit One, this is Condor.

587
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:31,411
This is Unit One.

588
01:13:34,005 --> 01:13:34,967
All clear.

589
01:13:36,561 --> 01:13:37,633
Unit Two.

590
01:13:41,011 --> 01:13:43,729
- All quiet round back.
- Unit Three.

591
01:13:45,733 --> 01:13:47,333
He's down in the street.

592
01:14:13,834 --> 01:14:16,368
Condor, this is Unit Three. All clear.

593
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:21,025
Condor, this is Seeker.
We're about 15 minutes away from you.

594
01:14:22,213 --> 01:14:23,883
We copy that, Seeker.

595
01:15:15,364 --> 01:15:19,965
Unit Three, where's that woman's dog?
She hasn't got her dog with her.

596
01:15:22,292 --> 01:15:24,176
Unit Three, come in.

597
01:15:25,244 --> 01:15:27,477
Come in, Unit Three.

598
01:15:29,807 --> 01:15:31,419
Unit Three, come in.

599
01:15:33,031 --> 01:15:35,458
Unit One, we've got trouble.

600
01:15:38,167 --> 01:15:40,438
You trying to get killed, buddy?

601
01:15:50,766 --> 01:15:53,700
Condor, this is Unit One. Unit Three's dead.

602
01:15:54,988 --> 01:15:59,655
The target is in the building.
I repeat, the target is in the building.

603
01:16:08,911 --> 01:16:12,445
Eve? What are you doing here?

604
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:20,949
- I miss something here?
- Timmy is here, isn't he?

605
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,726
Well, sure, it's the weekend.

606
01:16:28,366 --> 01:16:31,046
That's a different look.

607
01:16:33,202 --> 01:16:35,559
Is there raining now?

608
01:16:36,445 --> 01:16:38,579
What's the matter? What's wrong?

609
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:45,262
- Where's Timmy?
- Are you Ok?

610
01:16:46,252 --> 01:16:47,653
I need to see my son.

611
01:16:50,884 --> 01:16:57,586
- Where is he? I need to see him now.
- Hold on here. What the hell is going on here?

612
01:16:57,871 --> 01:17:01,420
- Hi Mom, what are you doing here?
- Hey, Timmy.

613
01:17:01,591 --> 01:17:05,106
You miss me, don't you?
You do miss me, don't you?

614
01:17:05,761 --> 01:17:07,887
Timmy, I love you, you know that I,

615
01:17:07,888 --> 01:17:11,222
I'm sorry we don't spend
more time together, Timmy.

616
01:17:13,111 --> 01:17:19,220
Look Eve, you're upset, Ok. Maybe we
should just sit and talk about it, Ok?

617
01:17:19,683 --> 01:17:25,411
- Please, I...
- Eve, let's talk, Ok?

618
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,344
- Please...
- Come on...

619
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:31,320
We'll sit-down and
have some coffee, right?

620
01:17:32,984 --> 01:17:34,587
Come on.

621
01:17:44,984 --> 01:17:49,372
Timmy, you want help me
make your mom some coffee?

622
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:01,606
Ok, come on.

623
01:18:33,529 --> 01:18:37,655
- Is Mommy going to be Ok?
- Yeah, she's going to be fine.

624
01:18:51,130 --> 01:18:51,980
Hello?

625
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:53,180
- Peter?
- Yes.

626
01:18:53,914 --> 01:18:57,963
- This is going to be difficult, it's Eve.
- What?

627
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:03,171
- The woman in your apartment is not me.
- Who the hell is this?

628
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:05,642
- Look through the window.
- What?

629
01:19:05,828 --> 01:19:09,695
Peter, please. This is not a joke.
Look through the window.

630
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,600
It's me.

631
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:25,479
Oh, my God.

632
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:34,861
Listen carefully...

633
01:19:35,793 --> 01:19:40,260
your life and Timmy's depend on
how you act in the next few minutes.

634
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:43,735
You know what I've been working on.

635
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,489
- Peter.
- Yeah, yeah.

636
01:19:47,651 --> 01:19:51,652
She's one of my robots, Peter.
And she's very dangerous.

637
01:19:53,571 --> 01:19:56,763
- Shit.
- What's wrong?

638
01:19:57,331 --> 01:20:01,656
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?

639
01:20:01,858 --> 01:20:06,516
Tell to get Timmy out of there, come down in
the elevator and we'll meet him in the lobby.

640
01:20:06,517 --> 01:20:07,718
Hey, are you still there?

641
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:09,139
- Peter?
- Yes.

642
01:20:09,485 --> 01:20:13,930
You got to get Timmy out of the apartment.
Somebody will meet you in the lobby.

643
01:20:13,931 --> 01:20:16,331
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.

644
01:20:16,789 --> 01:20:18,814
But then do it now, please.

645
01:21:20,398 --> 01:21:23,155
- Where's your mom?
- I don't know.

646
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:27,285
It's good now, we're
going to go out for a little while.

647
01:21:27,286 --> 01:21:33,175
- But, Dad...
- I want you to be very quiet, Ok?

648
01:23:00,844 --> 01:23:02,048
Get in here.

649
01:23:08,262 --> 01:23:10,596
He's still alive. Get an ambulance.

650
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:14,806
- She's used the emergency exit.
- Get my back.

651
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:22,342
Get out of the way.

652
01:24:01,005 --> 01:24:05,277
- Mommy.
- Timmy.

653
01:24:36,806 --> 01:24:41,058
No, put me down.

654
01:24:41,634 --> 01:24:43,809
Get back. Get back.

655
01:24:44,132 --> 01:24:46,399
- That's my son, McQuade.
- Get back.

656
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:50,439
Let me go. Let me go.

657
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:51,712
Help, help, help.

658
01:25:52,177 --> 01:25:54,789
- Let me down.
- I'll take care of you.

659
01:25:54,819 --> 01:26:01,024
- No, put me down. Please, let me go.
- I'll take care of you.

660
01:26:01,054 --> 01:26:06,921
Hey, what's your fucking problem, bitch? Why
don't you watch where the fuck you're going?

661
01:26:10,256 --> 01:26:14,169
Subject has gone into
subway, 53rd and Fifth. Look out.

662
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:17,450
Copy that, Seeker. Project the area damage.

663
01:26:25,352 --> 01:26:27,488
Dear God...

664
01:26:30,983 --> 01:26:33,410
Look out, get out of the way.

665
01:26:53,928 --> 01:26:58,316
Homer, this is Seeker. Dead
and injured on 53rd and Fifth station.

666
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:04,006
Target believed headed for
Lexington Avenue. Am in pursuit. Stay down.

667
01:27:04,451 --> 01:27:06,879
Please don't shoot.

668
01:27:07,868 --> 01:27:08,887
Wait.

669
01:27:09,655 --> 01:27:12,693
Evacuate Lexington
Avenue and stop the trains.

670
01:27:12,723 --> 01:27:15,880
And you better tell the New York Police
Department to stay the hell out of this.

671
01:27:15,881 --> 01:27:18,481
I don't want anybody taking a pot shot.

672
01:27:31,105 --> 01:27:34,384
Please, get help. Please.

673
01:27:56,626 --> 01:28:00,893
Sir, the transit authority say
their computers are going haywire.

674
01:28:01,946 --> 01:28:06,291
- They can't stop the trains.
- It's her.

675
01:29:07,049 --> 01:29:09,884
Get out of there, motherfucker.

676
01:30:46,746 --> 01:30:49,021
Fuck you, lady. Fuck you, lady.

677
01:30:50,162 --> 01:30:53,796
What the hell are you looking at, bitch?
Bitch, bitch, bitch...

678
01:30:53,797 --> 01:30:56,236
No one will ever shut a door on you.

679
01:31:32,478 --> 01:31:35,481
Mommy will protect you, I promise.

680
01:31:40,427 --> 01:31:43,765
- Eve.
- Mommy. Mommy.

681
01:31:43,795 --> 01:31:49,256
Eve, throw him to me, please, throw him.

682
01:31:53,789 --> 01:31:55,381
Eve, please.

683
01:31:58,236 --> 01:32:03,382
Please throw him. Eve, please.

684
01:32:59,645 --> 01:33:01,617
It's Ok.

685
01:33:24,406 --> 01:33:27,349
Run. Timmy, run.

686
01:34:03,987 --> 01:34:07,590
Hey, bitch.

687
01:34:52,388 --> 01:34:58,136
Hey Doc, you want to give me a hand here?

688
01:35:26,234 --> 01:35:29,834
Guess you finally found the
fucking off-switch, eh Doc?
