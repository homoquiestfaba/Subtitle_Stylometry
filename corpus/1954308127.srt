00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,880
l guess l forgot.

510
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,920
You forgot.

511
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,080
lt's no big deal, Christine.

512
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,560
Two kids ripped off a Mercedes,
and this guy tried to bust it up.

513
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,240
You forgot.

514
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,520
l didn't know the guy...

515
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:49,760
...but he didn't sound so bright.

516
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,480
No, it didn't sound like it.

517
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,640
The article said he was out there alone.

518
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,240
Can we not get into this, okay?

519
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,000
Okay.

520
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,600
-Okay.
-Come on upstairs.

521
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,360
Okay.

522
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,120
CHRISTINE:
Curren.

523
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,200
ALEX:
Morning.

524
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,520
Auto-theft convictions with assaults.
Forty-five names.

525
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:25,320
l came in early.

526
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,800
-Feel like some company?
-l work alone, Kearney.

527
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,200
l got a friend at the Bryn Mawr station,
ran all those names through the computer.

528
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,520
Four are dead. 35 are doing time.

529
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,440
l got last known addresses
on the other six.

530
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,480
You really do want to die
down here, don't you?

531
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,880
l wanna be a cop, Dennis.

532
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,920
ALEX: Okay, first guy is Bruce Tucker,
and his last known address is--

533
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,920
DENNIS:
Shut up. l know where to find him.

534
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,320
ALEX:
Oh, forgive me, then.

535
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:58,320
lf this doesn't work,
l got a couple other things to try.

536
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,320
-Come again?
-l'm just saying l got some other ideas.

537
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,960
You got nerve,
that's what you got. Shit.

538
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:09,080
You're not supposed to be out here.
Where's your uniform?

539
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:12,000
Stolen out of my car.
They left one shoe under my seat.

540
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:14,240
l could go back
and put it on if you want.

541
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,720
You're not smart enough
to keep the seat warm.

542
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,800
What, are you gonna have a stroke
if you're nice to somebody?

543
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,600
Yo, baby. l got that fire.
Better come get it.

544
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,520
Better get it while l got it.
When it's gone, it's gone.

545
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,800
You look good.
Yo, homey, l'll get you high.

546
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,120
Come on, Dennis, look at this!

547
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:33,680
DENNIS:
Forget about him. Just stay in the car.

548
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,880
Please stop telling me to do that.
He's pushing dope right in front of us.

549
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:42,760
Don't do this!

550
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,720
Dennis, stop the car!

551
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,160
Dennis! Dennis, l'm hanging out!

552
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,680
What are you doing?

553
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,720
Shit! Dennis!

554
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,480
DENNIS:
Brucie!

555
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:16,000
Guess who!

556
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,800
Come on out, Brucie.

557
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:22,320
You can't run, you're too damn fat!

558
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,440
You should haul your jumbo butt
into a gym.

559
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,480
BRUCE:
Get the fuck off me, man!

560
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:55,080
ALEX: Stop! Police!
-Get off!

561
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,000
ALEX: Freeze!
-Get off me!

562
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:03,680
l got him.

563
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,360
Freeze.

564
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:11,640
BRUCE: Now, wait a minute, Dennis.
l'm nickel and dime, man. You know that.

565
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,120
l part out a car every now and then!

566
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,040
Sheet says you shot a guy
in Cherry Hill, Brucie.

567
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:21,720
Self-defense, man!
Judge said so. DA said so.

568
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:24,120
l wouldn't do no cop.

569
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,360
Talk to me, Brucie.
Tell me something l don't know.

570
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:29,000
Dennis!

571
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:30,520
-What?
-Can l talk to you?

572
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:32,160
-What?
-l'll just take a second.

573
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,200
-Dennis.
-What do you want?

574
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,120
lf you're gonna question the suspect,
you should read him his rights first.

575
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:41,720
Section 10-1 2. An officer is required--

576
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,040
What the hell are you talking about?

577
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:46,360
-Let the man have his say, Dennis.
-Shut up!

578
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:50,080
-Look, l ain't even collared his ass yet.
-Well, that's another thing.

579
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,000
lf we haven't charged
the gentleman with anything...

580
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:55,720
...we really don't have the right
to interrogate him.

581
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,320
-At least not without his attorney present.
-Thank you, officer.

582
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,480
You know, it's damn refreshing to see
that kind of professionalism these days.

583
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:06,280
Don't you understand anything?

584
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,760
l'm trying to get what he knows
and trade it off for the bust.

585
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,160
What bust?

586
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,000
You blow off his civil rights, the charges
won't stick, you have no bust.

587
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:18,680
Get over there!
You open your mouth again.. .

588
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,520
...l'm gonna tear both your lips off.
You got that?

589
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,680
He called me a gentleman.

590
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,360
You talk to me, asshole. Right now.

591
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,200
No way, Curren.
What about my attorney?

592
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,920
-l got your attorney right here.
-He's good.

593
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:36,120
That is one of the worst violations
of department ethics l--

594
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,360
That's up there too.

595
00:44:42,519 --> 00:44:46,520
You give me something l can use,
and l'll just tag you with receiving.

596
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,800
You'll be out in time for dinner.

597
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,200
Man l'm parting for...

598
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,040
...he's talking about a street gang
called The Falcons.

599
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:56,360
They been doing two or three cars
a night. Big time, Dennis.

600
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:58,960
They're working out of some warehouse
at the docks.

601
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:02,000
-l swear to God!
-So!

602
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,000
Lose some weight, fool.

603
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,840
l'm working on it!

604
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:18,920
-You gonna write me a parking ticket?
-Oh, that's really funny.

605
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,800
-Get in the back.
-What about the suspect?

606
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,520
He's riding the front with me. Get in.

607
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,920
You wanna follow the book,
go back to that pansy-ass suburb.

608
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,320
lt's your book too! l was just
trying to do my job in there, okay?

609
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,000
Like l was trying to do
with the guy pushing coke.

610
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,480
He was a decoy.

611
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:37,880
Working the street
with a bag of baking soda.. .

612
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:40,400
...in case some simple cop
like you came along.

613
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:42,720
At least it worked on somebody.

614
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,960
-l ain't never ridden up front before.
-Shut up.

615
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:50,120
ALEX:
You guys look happy there.

616
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,280
CHRISTINE:
And this is the wedding.

617
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,960
-These are the kids.
-Who's this?

618
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,960
-That's Amy and Robert...
-Amy. Robert.

619
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:58,920
-...and Adam.
-Nice. Good-looking family, Dennis.

620
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:02,960
l cashed your check.
Toys ''R'' Us is open till 7.

621
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,360
l told you l'd take them down there
this weekend.

622
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:09,080
Christine, l wish you wouldn't
come down here.

623
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:11,280
lt can't wait, Dennis. It's his birthday.

624
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,240
He wants the gift to be from you,
and l won't lie to him.

625
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,080
She's got a good point, Dennis.

626
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:19,880
The party's at 7,
and Mama's coming in from Camden.

627
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:22,880
When Alex mentioned
he was working with you.. .

628
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:24,560
...l asked him if he'd come.

629
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:27,920
He said that he has time
to buy a present.

630
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:30,480
ALEX: Right there?
-Yes.

631
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:32,680
ALEX: On those potatoes?
A little on the meat?

632
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,280
ROBERT: No, thanks.
ALEX: No? Got it anyway, didn't you?

633
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,200
-This is really good.
CHRISTINE: Really?

634
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,520
ALEX: Yeah.
CHRISTINE: Thank you.

635
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:44,120
GLORIA: She's a great cook.
Did you get a roll, Alex?

636
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:47,680
-Here you go, baby.
AMY: They gave Robert a surprise party.

637
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,400
ALEX:
That true, Robert? Were you surprised?

638
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:53,560
-Waiting for me to cut up yours?
ROBERT: They just said, ''Surprise!''

639
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:55,000
l was embarrassed, though.

640
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:56,760
l'm not hungry.

641
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,720
Me too. l'm not hungry too.

642
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,560
-Eat your food, Adam.
-Uh-uh.

643
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,680
-Adam, eat your food.
-Uh-uh.

644
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,120
Relax, Dennis. He'll eat.

645
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,440
How long have you been
on the force, Alex?

646
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,080
A little over a year. Hang on a second.

647
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:20,040
Adam, don't you know what this is?

648
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:22,960
This is the starship Enterpríse.

649
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:28,120
We're in deep space, low on fuel,
oxygen is running out.

650
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:31,440
We're struggling to make it
to Beta Colony 6.

651
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,040
You are Beta Colony 6, Adam.

652
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:35,960
Save it, Kearney.

653
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,480
The warp drive is out.

654
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:40,800
We're on impulse power.

655
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:42,960
Bones. Bones!

656
00:47:43,159 --> 00:47:44,600
We're running out of oxygen.

657
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,520
Damn it, Jim.
l'm a doctor, not a magician.

658
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:51,800
Captain! Captain!
l don't think we're gonna make it!

659
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,320
l've giving her all she's got!
l don't think it's gonna make it!

660
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,040
Would you just put the damn fork down?
If he wants to eat, he'll eat.

661
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:01,640
[LAUGHING]

662
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,280
AMY: Maybe he should try that
with Daddy now.

663
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,240
ROBERT: Are you kidding?
AMY: Yes.

664
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,920
Christine, l ain't gotta take this.

665
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:13,880
This is my house.

666
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:17,080
Who else you got coming over here,
the Osmond Brothers?

667
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,880
AMY: Do the spaceship again!
-Dennis.

668
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:28,800
Dennis!

669
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,240
l got him a race set.
l'll put it together later.

670
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,280
lt's nice. It's nice. He'll like it.

671
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,520
lf you're going down to shoot pool,
l'd lose the hat.

672
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,720
He's a pain in the ass.

673
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,920
Why? Because he's a cop,
