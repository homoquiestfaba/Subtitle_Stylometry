00:32:27,932 --> 00:32:29,599
[Parker chuckles]

535
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,370
I know.
I was just kidding.

536
00:32:34,772 --> 00:32:36,440
You're hilarious.

537
00:32:40,444 --> 00:32:42,814
[birds chirping]

538
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:49,252
Josh may come over for dinner.

539
00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:51,956
What? Really?

540
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:55,860
Don't make me regret it.

541
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:57,327
I won't. I promise.

542
00:32:57,962 --> 00:32:59,229
You're the best, Aunt Len.

543
00:33:04,936 --> 00:33:06,536
See that, Hank?

544
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,538
The lizard-lady's the best.

545
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,411
[throaty spit]

546
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,534
Thanks again for having me.

547
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:38,903
[Parker]
Mm-hmm.

548
00:33:40,838 --> 00:33:42,405
[Aunt Len]
Certainly.

549
00:33:42,706 --> 00:33:44,842
It's um. It was
a pretty long drive out here.

550
00:33:45,475 --> 00:33:46,710
But it's nice.

551
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:48,780
It was like
a really nice drive out here.

552
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,647
I don't like the city.

553
00:33:50,882 --> 00:33:52,784
[Josh]
Yeah, no. For sure, for sure.

554
00:33:52,817 --> 00:33:54,317
I feel that. I feel that.

555
00:33:54,786 --> 00:33:56,453
It was kinda nice
just having some alone time

556
00:33:56,486 --> 00:33:57,989
with my thoughts
and stuff on the drive.

557
00:33:58,488 --> 00:34:04,028
Just like, really great just
thinking about life, stuff.

558
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:09,934
You got
a sick-ass pad, Aunt Len.

559
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:16,373
Uh, so Aunt Len.

560
00:34:16,406 --> 00:34:19,409
Josh loves that,
um, Star Trek show you watch.

561
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:21,444
Oh, yeah?

562
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,446
But the only
good run was the Voyager.

563
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,614
It's so cool and vintage.

564
00:34:24,882 --> 00:34:26,650
It's the original or nothing.

565
00:34:26,683 --> 00:34:28,953
You kids don't know
what quality is anymore.

566
00:34:28,986 --> 00:34:30,955
You're crazy, Aunt Len.

567
00:34:30,988 --> 00:34:32,824
I mean, Voyager's got
some serious girl power, too.

568
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:36,027
You gotta appreciate that.
Captain Janeway. Jeez.

569
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,962
[Aunt Len]
Do I?

570
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:40,597
Okay, well, then,
I gotta know this.

571
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,632
You're obviously
into it, especially now,

572
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:44,035
with the government releasing
new information...

573
00:34:45,236 --> 00:34:48,005
What's your thoughts on the
whole extraterrestrial thing?

574
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,506
[Parker clears her throat]

575
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:50,875
The whole thing?

576
00:34:50,908 --> 00:34:52,944
Yeah, I mean, are they real,
not real?

577
00:34:52,977 --> 00:34:54,744
[Aunt Len]
Of course they're real.

578
00:34:55,246 --> 00:34:58,515
How could anyone
be so unbelievably naive

579
00:34:58,548 --> 00:35:00,483
and narrow minded to think that

580
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,787
we're the only intelligent
beings in this entire universe?

581
00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:05,823
See? Yes, I completely agree.

582
00:35:05,857 --> 00:35:08,059
So let's... Let's
take it to the next level.

583
00:35:08,092 --> 00:35:10,828
What do they want?
Are they good? Are they bad?

584
00:35:10,862 --> 00:35:15,099
What do they want?
Domination at any cost.

585
00:35:15,732 --> 00:35:18,069
Oh, but they're not
like the ridiculous aliens

586
00:35:18,102 --> 00:35:20,470
you see in TV
and in the movies.

587
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:24,041
They're highly
intelligent and strategic.

588
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:28,145
Alien is a pedestrian
word for what they are.

589
00:35:29,146 --> 00:35:31,681
[Josh] You could be right.
You could be right.

590
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:33,617
I mean, you likely are.

591
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,086
But what do they do?

592
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,788
I mean,
is it Alien or Body Snatchers?

593
00:35:37,822 --> 00:35:39,924
Do they just
want to learn from us?

594
00:35:39,957 --> 00:35:41,893
Experiment?
Or kill?

595
00:35:42,894 --> 00:35:43,995
Kill.

596
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:50,167
Star Trek gets it so wrong.

597
00:35:51,235 --> 00:35:53,838
Yes, they do.

598
00:35:53,871 --> 00:35:55,672
You can hang, Aunt Len.

599
00:35:55,705 --> 00:35:56,974
Thank you.

600
00:35:57,008 --> 00:35:58,976
And this meat loaf is <i>fuego.</i>

601
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,112
Yeah,
really delicious, Aunt Len.

602
00:36:01,145 --> 00:36:04,714
I added a teaspoon of syrup.
My secret.

603
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:06,483
I'll have to remember that.

604
00:36:09,586 --> 00:36:10,855
Hey, Aunt Len.

605
00:36:10,888 --> 00:36:12,589
Do you know this guy

606
00:36:12,622 --> 00:36:13,758
who was supposedly
one of your neighbours?

607
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:15,059
Hank, I think.

608
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:17,128
Nah, he's nothing
to worry about.

609
00:36:18,495 --> 00:36:19,663
Hank?

610
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:21,498
He seemed pretty off.

611
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:23,134
Yeah.
He won't bother you again.

612
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:25,568
[Parker]
Okay.

613
00:36:26,003 --> 00:36:28,471
[Josh]
So any word from Mama Park?

614
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:33,044
What?

615
00:36:33,077 --> 00:36:34,845
[Aunt Len]
She's had a bad few days.

616
00:36:36,948 --> 00:36:39,649
The treatment
caused a terrible reaction.

617
00:36:40,217 --> 00:36:41,919
Shit babe,
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

618
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:44,021
Why didn't you tell me?

619
00:36:45,522 --> 00:36:46,891
It's okay,
let's just enjoy the night.

620
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,798
Are you going to finish that?

621
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:01,038
Thanks, Aunt Len.

622
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:03,707
You want some?

623
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,809
No.

624
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,146
[Josh exhales deeply]

625
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,247
[Parker]
That went well.

626
00:37:10,281 --> 00:37:11,681
[Josh]
You think?

627
00:37:11,983 --> 00:37:14,218
[Parker] Yeah,
you sure were talking a lot.

628
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:16,954
Yeah. Just feeling her out.

629
00:37:21,058 --> 00:37:22,559
I'm sorry about your mom.

630
00:37:22,592 --> 00:37:25,196
I hate that this
is happening to you.

631
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,531
Weird, how some can
just have a reaction like that.

632
00:37:28,565 --> 00:37:31,501
Yeah, me too.

633
00:37:32,236 --> 00:37:34,071
See you tomorrow.

634
00:37:34,105 --> 00:37:36,941
I have math first, so
I'll see you between classes.

635
00:37:39,709 --> 00:37:40,911
You are so pretty.

636
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:42,612
[chuckles]

637
00:37:42,645 --> 00:37:43,747
Bye.

638
00:37:43,781 --> 00:37:45,916
[Josh sighs]

639
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,918
[door clicking]

640
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:05,302
[Aunt Len]
She's going to be all right.

641
00:38:06,137 --> 00:38:07,238
Huh?

642
00:38:08,005 --> 00:38:10,041
I know you're
worried about your mother.

643
00:38:10,908 --> 00:38:12,243
She's strong.

644
00:38:12,476 --> 00:38:15,112
We have to believe
she's going to pull through.

645
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:20,885
I know. You're right.

646
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:24,021
It's just been really hard.

647
00:38:25,156 --> 00:38:26,723
And not seeing her is...

648
00:38:30,127 --> 00:38:31,862
Why haven't
we seen you in so long?

649
00:38:34,631 --> 00:38:37,600
Your mother and I
were very close as children,

650
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:39,904
all the way through to our 20s.

651
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:43,841
We just chose
different paths for our lives.

652
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:45,642
Things got busy.

653
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:49,880
I blinked and bam,
the little girl I once knew

654
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:51,748
was almost an adult.

655
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,619
I'm sorry, I didn't make
an effort to come see you more.

656
00:38:56,653 --> 00:38:57,822
And your mother.

657
00:38:58,556 --> 00:39:01,959
That's why I have to believe
she's going to pull through.

658
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:05,662
I hope to get
a chance to make things right.

659
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:08,899
Like before
the change happened.

660
00:39:08,933 --> 00:39:10,134
[eerie music]

661
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:11,302
It's not all on you.

662
00:39:13,204 --> 00:39:14,972
Don't feel bad.

663
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:17,842
Mom could have tried harder.
We all could have.

664
00:39:19,076 --> 00:39:21,779
[Aunt Len]
You're a good girl, Parker.

665
00:39:22,313 --> 00:39:25,648
Don't let the bad
things out there get you.

666
00:39:27,151 --> 00:39:29,120
- [glass shatters]
- [gasping]

667
00:39:29,854 --> 00:39:32,722
- Sky booms.
- [Parker] What is it?

668
00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:37,061
[Aunt Len] Nobody really knows
for sure. I've got my theories.

669
00:39:38,395 --> 00:39:40,630
Sounds like a war out there.

670
00:39:41,098 --> 00:39:44,301
Perhaps it is.
We just don't know it yet.

671
00:39:45,436 --> 00:39:47,204
I've been
hearing them a lot lately.

672
00:39:47,972 --> 00:39:49,874
They come and they go.

673
00:39:49,907 --> 00:39:51,108
What do you mean?

674
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:53,310
[running footsteps]

675
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,280
[Aunt Len] No worries!
Nothing to worry about!

676
00:39:57,214 --> 00:39:59,116
What the... fuck?

677
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:03,988
I... I'm going to bed.

678
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:05,990
[door slamming]

679
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:11,829
[sighs]

680
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,333
[Aunt Len]
Parker?

681
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:17,968
Not now.

682
00:40:21,172 --> 00:40:22,439
What happened?

683
00:40:22,473 --> 00:40:23,874
Boy shit.

684
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:26,777
[Aunt Len]
I'm not very good at that.

685
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:29,780
That's okay. I'll be fine.

686
00:40:30,614 --> 00:40:33,884
Anyone who makes
you cry is not worth your time.

687
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:35,786
I've never
wasted a moment on it.

688
00:40:37,988 --> 00:40:39,056
I love the idiot.

689
00:40:39,924 --> 00:40:41,025
That's the problem.

690
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:44,727
What is young love?

691
00:40:44,762 --> 00:40:47,064
It's almost certain
you'll move on from each other,

692
00:40:47,097 --> 00:40:49,266
it's not permanent.

693
00:40:49,466 --> 00:40:54,905
It's hormones and insecurities,
neediness and jealousy.

694
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:58,175
Believe me, you're better off.

695
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:02,980
Believe me.
I wish it was that simple.

696
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,250
He just basically
lied to me about everything

697
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:08,252
and destroyed our entire plan.

698
00:41:08,953 --> 00:41:10,387
I guess we're
talking about this.

699
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:12,957
So Josh
is a year older than me.

700
00:41:14,425 --> 00:41:15,993
He was going to put off school

701
00:41:16,026 --> 00:41:18,028
for a year
and work to save money.

702
00:41:18,062 --> 00:41:20,064
And then when I graduate, we
were going to move out together

703
00:41:20,097 --> 00:41:21,432
and go to the same school.

704
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:25,436
Now apparently he wants to go
to college now and not defer.

705
00:41:25,469 --> 00:41:27,504
And he got accepted
into a totally different school

706
00:41:27,538 --> 00:41:29,206
I didn't even
know he applied to.

707
00:41:30,074 --> 00:41:31,475
Guys are fucking liars.

708
00:41:32,443 --> 00:41:34,044
All people are liars.

709
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:37,815
[Aunt Len inhaling deeply
and sighing]

710
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:42,086
