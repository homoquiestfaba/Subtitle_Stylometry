Gunter, it's so great you
offered to do this, buddy.

I insist to Rosita.

I'm known as, like, the
very best babysitter.

00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,267
Are you sure you're
okay with this?

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,603
This will be as easy
as düsselberry pie.

I will prove to you, okay?
Trust Gunter.

at all, just call me.

No, no, no. You must go
back to sleeping, okay?

24

00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:05,984
Hmm. Okay, okay.
