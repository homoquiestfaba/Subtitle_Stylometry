- Dugan.

00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,458
You wouldn't hear it even if

41
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,649
you were standing on first base.

43
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,959
And I advise you to shut it.

44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,029

You're not gonna just sit
here watching a ball game.

00:04:57,415 --> 00:04:58,248
I don't want you to hit.

Sorry my man.

Look, see everything works, okay.

109

I'm fine, let's play the game.

111
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,363

112
00:06:18,364 --> 00:06:19,869

113
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,719
Tomorrow's another day.

114
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,859
- Is that a guarantee?

115
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,399
- You want a guarantee?

116
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,029
Go buy a toaster.

117
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,529
- Let Emma make you some lemonade.

118
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,719
- Oh no, no, no, I'm fine.

119
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,119
I'll just take a walk.

120
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,920

122
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,259

00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,352
How many times do I have to tell you,

124
00:06:53,353 --> 00:06:55,936
catch the ball with both hands!

125
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,303
- Hey mister, you okay?

126
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,130
- Yeah, I'm fine kid.

127
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,949
- [Coach] Because you
didn't move your feet.

128
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,163
- You don't sound fine.

129
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,278
And you look even worse.

130
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,548
- [Coach] You want your body to move,

131
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:10,869
you have to move your feet.

132
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,819
- What's that supposed to mean?

133
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,497
- You sound terrible.

134
00:07:14,498 --> 00:07:17,152
- Yeah, well I'm an old man, all right?

135
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:20,570
- [Coach] You gotta stay awake out there!

136
00:07:27,027 --> 00:07:28,154
- You mind?

137
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:29,155
- No.

138
00:07:32,706 --> 00:07:35,123
(slow music)

139
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:46,643
- I wish I had the chance to
play baseball when I was young.

140
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:48,910
- Why didn't you?

141
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:51,229
- For one thing

142
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,310
they didn't have little
league baseball then.

143
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,603
The country was in a depression.

144
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,179
And that, that pretty
much affected everybody.

145
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,183
- Why didn't everyone just take Prozac?

146
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,539
- Well, it wasn't that
kind of depression, Jenny.

147
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,259
- [Coach] Is that what you're
gonna tell the other team

148
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,279
when they whip your butts?

149
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,679
That's loser's talk!

150
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,599
And there's no room on
this team for losers!

151
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,429
- Now that's not right.

152
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,469
Yelling at you like that.

153
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,759
Don't your parents ever
say anything about it?

154
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,947
- He is my parent.

155
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:26,653
He's my father.

156
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,653
He's not a bad guy.

157
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,333
He's really a good guy.

158
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:38,557
He just gets hyper sometimes.

159
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,863
- [Coach] You gotta be kidding me!

160
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:48,527
Hold it, hold it!

161
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,907
- What's your name?

162
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:50,908
- Jenny.

163
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:57,832
- [Coach] Jenny, Jenny get over here!

164
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:58,916
- I gotta go.

165
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:09,586
- [Coach] Donalds, let's go!

166
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:13,291
Keep your eye on the ball.

167
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,027
Let's see some follow through here.

168
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:17,727
(girls giggling)

169
00:09:17,728 --> 00:09:18,998
- It's nothing, Emma.

170
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:20,057
I'm not concerned.

171
00:09:20,058 --> 00:09:21,891
- The truth, Jonathan.

172
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:32,549
- I met a young girl today.

173
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,623
Just like my Jenny.

174
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,149
And her name was Jenny.

175
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,933
- I asked you a question.

176
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,349
- Shortness of breath.

177
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,819
It's not significant.

178
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,820
- Who says?

179
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,073
- Emma, I'm a doctor.

180
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,089
- All you did was deliver babies.

181
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,739
Anybody can do that.

182
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,929
I delivered my sister's youngest child,

183
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,683
and I'm no doctor.

184
00:09:57,837 --> 00:09:59,593
Let me feel your pulse.

185
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,579
No pulse!

186
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,580
- Here, Emma.

187
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:06,854
- Well.

188
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,381
You're still going to see a doctor

189
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:11,965
the first thing in the morning.

190
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,403
A real doctor.

191
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:23,765
♪ I would walk for miles for you ♪

192
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:29,254
♪ I just want a smile from you ♪

193
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:36,365
(muffled cheerful music)

194
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:54,724
(slow piano music)

195
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:58,474
Well?

196
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:03,969
What did he say, Jonathan?

197
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,169
Out with it.

198
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,969
- He said nine innings is too much.

199
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,495
He said that I'm not a kid anymore.

200
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:11,221
Can you imagine that?

201
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:13,069
Telling me I'm not a kid anymore?

202
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,159
- What did he say, Jonathan?

203
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,490
- He said that

204
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,550
I should try to make my heart better.

205
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,363
Maybe I should think about a bypass.

206
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,039
- [Young Woman] Pill time.

207
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,983
- You and I need to have a little talk.

208
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
- Don't look good.

209
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:41,351
- What do you mean?

210
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:42,611
- What do I mean?

211
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:43,959
What do you mean what do I mean?

212
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,489
They're talking serious
here about a heart bypass.

213
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,199
What do I mean?

214
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,442
- Don't get surly with me.

215
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,443
- Surly.

216
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,473
- Look at that, Emma.

217
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:59,903
When I see those kids over
there playing baseball.

218
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:03,059
You know, at night I
dream about being a kid

219
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,060
playing baseball.

220
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:06,190
And now they're so organized.

221
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:07,440
They have little leagues.

222
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,983
When I was kid I didn't
have time to play baseball.

223
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,990
Now there's time.

224
00:12:21,348 --> 00:12:24,265
(slow piano music)

225
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,720
I'd give anything to be one of those kids.

226
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,950
- Anything?

227
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:33,653
- Anything in this world.

228
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,823
- Mr. Cassio, this is Emma Gray.

229
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,359
- [Cassio] Yes, Emma?

230
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,770
Have you made up your mind?

231
00:12:48,773 --> 00:12:50,649
- Yes, yes I have.

232
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,539
It will be a man.

233
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,669
Jonathan Lyle.

234
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,119
I think he's ready.

235
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,979
You see his heart is failing.

236
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,049
- [Cassio] How do you know he is ready?

237
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,050
- Well I...

238
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,384
He said to me he'd give anything.

239
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:10,218
- [Cassio] I see.

240
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:12,623
- [Emma] Anything in this world, he said.

241
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:13,769
- [Cassio] I see.

242
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,119
Does he have a family?

243
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,859
Wife, children?

244
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,993
- [Emma] No, none.

245
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,639
Oh once I think there was a girl.

246
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,903
Jenny, I think.

247
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,463
But she passed away suddenly.

248
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,430
Long ago.

249
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,039
- [Cassio] Okay.

250
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,240
You must bring him here.

251
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,290
- [Emma] Yes, Mr. Cassio.

252
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,575
- [Cassio] Emma, does he know

253
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:39,993
there is a price?

254
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,533
- [Emma] No, he does not.

255
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,469
I decided that I'll pay the price.

256
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,779
I thought it out.

257
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,209
It's my time, Mr. Cassio.

258
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,839
I know it.

259
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,103
And so I'm going to pay the price.

260
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,763
Just as my sister did for me.

261
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,447
I'm ready now.

262
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:03,572
It's my time.

263
00:14:29,343 --> 00:14:32,926
(indistinct radio chatter)

264
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:36,739
- I'm gonna light a
candle for you, Jonathan.

265
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,740
Both ends.

266
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:41,599
(speaking in Spanish)

267
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,976
- You might find out when
you're gonna get sick?

268
00:14:42,977 --> 00:14:45,539
- Now please, don't start with
that after life stuff, okay?

269
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,546
It's just that I'm going
in for a few tests,

270
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:49,749
a second opinion if you will.

271
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,757
I'll be back in five days, right?

272
00:14:52,695 --> 00:14:55,195
(jazzy music)

273
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,990
- Jonathan.

274
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,539
- I thought you were crazy, Emma.

275
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,540
Now I'm sure of it.

276
00:15:33,893 --> 00:15:34,943
- Don't you trust me?

277
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,830
Come over here.

278
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,247
I wanna show you something.

279
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,223
That's me, Johnny.

280
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,300
Oh Mr. Cassio.

281
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:04,124
(mysterious music)

282
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:39,406
- [Jonathan] Could you just explain?

283
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:54,893
Yeah but...

284
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,770
- On Friday at exactly six o'clock

285
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,433
he will change back.

286
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,239
Do you understand, Emma?

287
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,103
- I know, I remember.

288
00:17:19,963 --> 00:17:21,333
Thank you, Mr. Cassio.

289
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:26,150
But I wish I knew how you did it

290
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,437
and where I was going.

291
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,079
- Emma, there are many paths.

292
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,263
What we call time.

293
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:39,059
You see, time is like a force

294
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,020
that we wander in

295
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,733
while others hurry through.

296
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,640
You will never be lost, Emma.

297
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:55,953
You are guided from within.

298
00:17:58,553 --> 00:18:01,136
(gentle music)

299
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:13,280
(thunder rumbling)

300
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,870
Drink this.

301
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:25,434
- [Jonathan] Can I ask...

302
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,093
- [Cassio] Mr. Lyle,
these are paths in time.

303
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,369
There are an infinite number of them.

304
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,709
But these here

305
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,060
represent all of your

306
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,213
past, present and future.

307
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:03,903
Mr. Lyle, you will not remember anything.

308
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:05,984
- Wait a minute.

309
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:09,059
What do you mean I
won't remember anything?

310
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,153
- You will try.

311
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,030
But you will not remember who you are

312
00:19:14,957 --> 00:19:16,569
these five days to come.

313
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,403
- Why is that?

314
00:19:17,403 --> 00:19:18,403
What is about to come?

315
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,533
- [Cassio] You will recall
your spirit, but not yourself.

316
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,213
Do you understand?

317
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
Mr. Lyle.

318
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,263
The interceptor.

319
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:17,325
(camera clicking and popping)

320
00:20:24,774 --> 00:20:27,857
(indistinct chatter)

321
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:41,454
(video games beeping)

322
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:06,318
(laughing)

323
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:17,263
(birds chirping)

324
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:42,336
(cheerful big band music)

325
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:48,219
- Evening, Mr. Lyle.

326
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,053
Welcome to the hotel.

327
00:21:49,053 --> 00:21:50,053
Great to see you.

328
00:21:56,091 --> 00:21:58,682
- [Older Man] Hi, Mr. Lyle, how are you?

329
00:21:58,683 --> 00:22:01,461
- [Man] Evening, Mr. Lyle.

330
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:02,629
- Hi Jonathan.

331
00:22:03,812 --> 00:22:06,895
(indistinct chatter)

332
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:12,314
- Jonathan, how are you?

333
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:13,193
- Hi Mr. Lyle.

334
00:22:13,194 --> 00:22:14,739
How are you today?

335
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,873
Charlie, will you help
Mr. Lyle to his room?

336
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,905
- Hi Mr. Lyle, my name's Chuck.

337
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:21,982
May I take your bag?

338
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:22,983
Okay.

339
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:52,966
(slow music)

340
00:23:27,889 --> 00:23:32,056
(indistinct sports radio chatter)

341
00:24:22,698 --> 00:24:25,448
(cheerful music)

342
00:25:38,692 --> 00:25:39,680
- Balance like this.

343
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:40,839
Left foot on the bag.

344
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,699
If you lean back you can't get a jump.

345
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,049
You get off too far and
you lean towards second

346
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,459
the catcher might pick you up.

347
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,460
Donald, you try it.

348
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,460
Let's go.

349
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,869
Maximize your right foot position.

350
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:55,219
You gotta be able to dive
back as quick as you can

351
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,249
when the catcher throws the ball.

352
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,003
Alright, Jed, Victor, let's go!

353
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,819
Not straight in!

354
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,719
Reach for the outside of the bag.

355
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,339
Touch the corner of the
bag with your left hand.

356
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,399
I assume you know your right
hand from your left hand.

357
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Next.

358
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,010
On your toes.

359
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:18,637
Hold it.

360
00:26:18,638 --> 00:26:19,638
Not you.

361
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,495
Reed, get in there.

362
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:25,009
- What do you mean not me?

363
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:25,843
- Just what I said.

364
00:26:25,844 --> 00:26:27,403
Come on, let's go Reed.

365
00:26:27,404 --> 00:26:28,529
- Why not me?

366
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,019
- Because I said so.

367
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,319
Off the bag or off the field.

368
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,883
Your choice, right now.

369
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,550
Well?

370
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,820
Come on, Reed.

371
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,693
Stretch off.

372
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:45,526
Get off there.

373
00:26:45,527 --> 00:26:46,859
- I am, coach.

374
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,409
- Hey, you gotta be able
to get to the next base.

375
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,460
You want to get to second base don't you?

376
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:54,431
Come on, more.

377
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,513
Alright, come on Victor.

378
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,439
Oh my gosh, that was the pit!

379
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,449
You gotta be...

380
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,790
Oh Reed.

381
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,374
You all right, bud?

382
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:09,587
You all right, bud?

383
00:27:09,588 --> 00:27:10,421
- Is he all right?

384
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:12,397
- He probably just had a hard fall.

385
00:27:15,294 --> 00:27:18,211
(upbeat pop music)

386
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:20,421
- Hey look.

387
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,489
- He's cute.

388
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,490
- Who is he?

389
00:27:27,744 --> 00:27:29,033
- I've never seen him around.

390
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,699
- Who's he?

391
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,533
- I don't know.

392
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:35,739
Who cares?

393
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,819
- [Boy] Looks like a new ball player.

394
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,653
- So what?

395
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:40,722
- So we need somebody
to take Reed's place.

396
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:42,219
- No one's taking my place.

397
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,493
- You're on the DL, Reed.

398
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
That's the rules.

399
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,319
- He's not that big.

400
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,321
- Fast.

401
00:27:49,322 --> 00:27:50,619
- I don't know, a new guy?

402
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,889
- Play offs man.

403
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,433
You gotta be able to go to your bench.

404
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:02,162
- You from around here?

405
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:03,569
- You play ball?

406
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,589
- Baseball, yeah.

407
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,173
Why?

408
00:28:06,174 --> 00:28:07,274
- Who do you play for?

409
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:13,489
Hey, what school you go to?

410
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:14,490
- School's out.

411
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,169
- Why don't you stop by
tomorrow at the batting cages?

412
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,490
That's where we usually hang out.

413
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,893
- Which one?

414
00:28:23,894 --> 00:28:25,370
- [Boy] The one right here.

415
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,129
- Oh yeah, okay that one.

416
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,903
- I'm Jed, that's Tommy.

417
00:28:31,037 --> 00:28:33,149
And that's Rashid.

418
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,219
- Jonathan.

419
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,769
Jonathan Lyle.

420
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,770
See you around.

421
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:55,520
(machine humming)

422
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,399
- Way to whack it, Tommy.

423
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,653
- Right Thomas man.

424
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:23,163
- [Boy] The machine
sneaks pitches sometimes.

425
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
- Be my guest.

426
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,397
- [Boy] You know there is
regular practice this afternoon

427
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:43,231
over by the old field.

428
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,879
- Dorky stance, man.

429
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,239
Look at the way he holds that bat.

430
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,210
- If he keeps them all mixed in

431
00:29:51,211 --> 00:29:53,423
he'll ride it right on out of here.

432
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,829
Might hit a tower records.

433
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,830
- We'll see.

434
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,463
- [Boy] Nice shot.

435
00:30:01,464 --> 00:30:03,029
He's not exactly Barry Bonds.

436
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,199
- Yeah, well neither was Reed.

437
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,889
This kid's not bad.

438
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,042
- I'd pitch him one outside.

439
00:30:08,043 --> 00:30:09,969
- [Boy] He should use his
body more when he swings.

440
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,849
With that hit he'll never
get past the pitcher.

441
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,650
Check out his wrist action, not bad.

442
00:30:18,435 --> 00:30:21,896
(machine humming)

443
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:24,564
(loud thudding)

444
00:30:30,717 --> 00:30:31,717
- Nice hit.

445
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,110
- Okay, let's see what you got, Jonathan.

446
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,019
There you go, that's using your head.

447
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,020
Try a pop up.

448
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,321
- [Boy] Better in the outfield, man.

449
00:30:44,322 --> 00:30:46,683
- [Coach] Stay with it, a little better.

450
00:30:46,684 --> 00:30:47,559
- It's no fair.

451
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,354
He gets to play and we don't.

452
00:30:49,355 --> 00:30:50,188
- Such a crock man,

453
00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:51,410
we never even see the kid before.

454
00:30:51,411 --> 00:30:52,909
Could be a spy from
another team or something.

455
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,509
- What's he gonna do, steal our signs?

456
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,029
- [Boy] He could have done
something to our Gatorade.

457
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,189
- There you go, that's using your head.

458
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,190
Try a pop up.

459
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,820
- Kid throws like my grandma.

460
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,589
- Okay gang, here's the deal.

461
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,999
Reed's out for the year.

462
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,449
And we're allowed to add
somebody to the roster.

463
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,400
Jonathan, right?

464
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:16,439
- [Jonathan] Yeah.

465
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,069
- Jonathan here

466
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,379
you prefer John or Jonathan?

467
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,715
- [Jonathan] Don't matter.

468
00:31:21,716 --> 00:31:23,816
- Showing a lot of hustle out there today.

469
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,913
- Ass kisser.

470
00:31:25,914 --> 00:31:27,309
- [Coach] Shut up, Tommy!

471
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,115
We barely made it to the playoffs

472
00:31:29,116 --> 00:31:30,949
and we're down a man.

473
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,089
- We guys can come off the bench.

474
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,649
- I can come off the bench.

475
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,909
- [Coach] Hey, John could help us.

476
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,219
But I'm gonna leave it up to you guys.

477
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,885
- I say you go with the guys you got.

478
00:31:40,886 --> 00:31:42,096
- It's not fair,

479
00:31:42,097 --> 00:31:43,389
he gets to play and we don't.

480
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,899
- [Coach] Hey, everybody's
gonna get a chance to play.

481
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,870
- [Boy] Pinch run on, big deal.

482
00:31:47,871 --> 00:31:48,959
- What if somebody else gets hurt?

483
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,809
- Hey, Jed's got a point.

484
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,089
Once the playoffs start, that's it.

485
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,129
- I'm playing hurt.

486
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,589
Rashid's playing hurt.

487
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,719
This time of season
everybody's playing hurt.

488
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,689
- That's why we need guys
who can come off the bench.

489
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,899
- We don't need him!

490
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,739
- [Coach] Calm down, calm down.

491
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,939
I'm gonna put it to a vote.

492
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,359
- We've been together all year as a team.

493
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,179
We don't need this guy.

494
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,079
- Hey, arms out, come on.

495
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,429
On the count of three.

496
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,769
Thumbs up or thumbs down.

497
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,369
Are you ready?

498
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:19,370
One, two, three.
(slow piano music)

499
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,689
Okay Jenny, it's all tied up.

500
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,690
It's up to you.

501
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,753
Let's go!

502
00:32:29,754 --> 00:32:31,648
We haven't got all day for this!

503
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:32,649
- Down!

504
00:32:40,105 --> 00:32:41,919
- [Coach] All right, it's official.

505
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,949
John's on the team.

506
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,699
So let's start acting like a team.

507
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,979
Come on, everybody up here.

508
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,429
Get your hands in there.

509
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,989
Here we go, come on.

510
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,009
Who's gonna win?

511
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,843
- [Team] Giants!

512
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,239
- [Coach] Ah, come on you
can do better than that.

513
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,415
John, get your hand in there.

514
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:57,166
(cheerful music)

515
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,409
Who's gonna win?

516
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,519
- [Team] Giants!

517
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,353
- [Coach] That's better.

518
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:11,719
Jenny, go get me that box of shirts.

519
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,049
The rest of you guys, get the equipment.

520
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,180
Let's go back out to the field!

521
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,169
- Okay, I have 12, 17 and five.

522
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,329
- Five.

523
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,859
Five was Joe DiMaggio's number.

524
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,339
- Say who?

525
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,739
- Joe DiMaggio.

526
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,449
- Some old guy that
does commercials on TV?

527
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,369
- The Yankee Clipper.

528
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,119
- [Boy] Wasn't he the guy
they made a movie about?

529
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,980
- You moron.

530
00:33:33,981 --> 00:33:34,999
That was Babe Ruth.

531
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,399
- No, there was another guy.

532
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,493
- Lou Gehrig, pride of the Yankees.

533
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:42,119
Mickey Mantle, the Commerce Comic.

534
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,439
Bill Rezudo, the Scooter.

535
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,994
- What's up with you
and Joe DiMaggio, man?

536
00:33:46,995 --> 00:33:48,679
- He's my favorite player.

537
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,993
- Joe DiMaggio?

538
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:52,661
(siren blaring)

539
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:01,909
- Hey, how come you wanna
wear a dead guy's number?

540
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,244
- He's not dead.

541
00:34:03,245 --> 00:34:04,445
- You calling me a liar?

542
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,802
- No, I'm just saying I
don't think he's dead.

543
00:34:08,803 --> 00:34:11,129
- That means you're calling me a liar.

544
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:12,169
- No it doesn't.

545
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,709
- Yes it does.

546
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,710
- No it doesn't

547
00:34:15,528 --> 00:34:17,093
- Then say Joe DiMaggio's dead.

548
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,219
- What's the matter with you?

549
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,669
- Say it.

550
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,870
- What's wrong with you?

551
00:34:29,445 --> 00:34:32,112
(boys shouting)

552

I don't have any roller blades.

704
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,513
- That's okay.

705
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,513
I have an extra pair.

706
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,470
- It's not only that.

707
00:43:22,471 --> 00:43:24,808
I don't know how to Rollerblade.

708
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:26,901
- [Jenny] You don't, you really don't?

She's pregnant.

723
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:52,903
- All right, bye.

724
00:43:56,683 --> 00:43:58,339
- [Coach] What do I have to do around here

725
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,009
to make myself clear?

726
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,493
Can't somebody take care of the dog?

728
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,999
- Mom, are we almost there yet?

729
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,383
Marley's getting one of those
weird lipstick things again,

730
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,179
- Jenny people don't just
live in hotels, you know.

731
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,716
They stay there, they don't live there.

732
00:44:19,717 --> 00:44:21,513
- That's all I know, mom.

733
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:24,619
- [Mom] Well, is he staying
with his parents maybe?

734
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,319
- [Jenny] I don't know.

735
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,529
- Is he rich?

736
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:30,409
- I just met him yesterday.

737
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:33,189
- I bet I know what part Jenny likes.

738
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:34,199
His butt.

739
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,839
- Kenny, you know I don't
like talk like that.

740
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,229
Look we're here.

741
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:40,693
Is that your friend over there?

742
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:42,870
- One word out of you

743
00:44:42,871 --> 00:44:46,049
and I'll nail your tongue
to the nearest tree.

744
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,033
- [Mom] Jenny, gross.

745
00:44:51,853 --> 00:44:52,853
- Hi.
- Hi.

746
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:01,009
- Oh, this is my mom and
that's my brother, Kenny.

747
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,159
- Hi, I'm Judy Neil.

748
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,509
And you're Jonathan?

749
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,343
- Yeah.

750
00:45:05,344 --> 00:45:06,859
- Jenny's told us so much about you.

751
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,409
- She has?

752
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:09,879
- Are you enjoying your stay here?

753
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,919
I guess you're here with your parents?

754
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,920
- Well not exactly.

755
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,077
- You know, Jenny never
mentioned where you live

756
00:45:16,078 --> 00:45:17,773
permanently, I mean.

757
00:45:22,243 --> 00:45:23,326
- She hasn't?

758
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:27,973
- Let's not do Oprah Winfrey now, mom.

759
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,750
Come on, let's get the blades out.

760
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,793
- Oh, it's okay.

761
00:45:34,794 --> 00:45:35,912
We can do it.

762
00:45:35,913 --> 00:45:36,800
- Oh Jonathan,

763
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:37,959
that's really sweet.

764
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,859
I know I look like I'm
about to pop any minute,

765
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,539
but baby's actually not
due for another 10 days,

766
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,379
so I'm fine really.

767
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,573
- Okay well thanks for the ride, mom.

768
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,580
See you later.

769
00:45:54,609 --> 00:45:55,520
- So are you hungry?

770
00:45:55,521 --> 00:45:56,753
- Oh no, it's okay.

771
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:00,270
Where do you want to go?

772
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,156
- I don't know, where do you want to go?

773
00:46:03,157 --> 00:46:04,157
- Um, the park.

774
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,980
- Okay.

775
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,979
- So you really don't
know how to Rollerblade?

776
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,259
- Really.

777
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,093
- That's weird.

778
00:46:11,094 --> 00:46:13,729
Everyone I know knows how to roller blade.

779
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,639
- Well not in the city.

780
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,373
- That's where you're from, the city?

781
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:20,259
- No.

782
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,413
- What do you mean no?

783
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,039
- I don't know what I mean.

784
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,509
- Okay.

785
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:27,793
Let's go lace up.

786
00:46:29,595 --> 00:46:30,794
- [Man] I got it, I got it.

787
00:46:30,795 --> 00:46:31,667
- That's okay.

788
00:46:31,668 --> 00:46:33,993
- I got it, I got it!

789
00:46:33,994 --> 00:46:35,577
I got it, I got it!

790
00:46:36,413 --> 00:46:38,996
(gentle music)

791
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,300
- Here, let me show you.

792
00:46:58,890 --> 00:46:59,890
- Soap.

793
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:02,905
- What?

794
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,780
- Uh...

795
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,393
Your hair smells like soap.

796
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,260
- Smells pretty good, huh?

797
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:20,837
Now you gotta keep your balance.

798
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,649
Just take it easy.

799
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:25,279
Don't try to walk, just push off.

800
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,280
Glide.

801
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,623
The faster you go the easier it is.

802
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,334
Ready to ride?

803
00:47:33,335 --> 00:47:34,849
- Yeah.

804
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:37,519
- Oh, keep your balance.

805
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,410
You're doing great.

806
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:40,513
Just try to keep your feet more together.

807
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:44,079
- I think I got a handle on it.

808
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,543
- Yeah, you're doing great.

809
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:55,288
(thudding)
Ow!

810
00:47:58,235 --> 00:47:59,564
- You okay?

811
00:47:59,565 --> 00:48:00,447
- I'm fine.

812
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:01,447
I just hit a pebble.

813
00:48:04,647 --> 00:48:07,314
(cloth ripping)

814
00:48:13,065 --> 00:48:14,365
- Just a little road rash.

815
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,848
That should do it.

816
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:26,699
- Did you learn that in health class?

817
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,737
- What?

818
00:48:28,738 --> 00:48:30,329
It's just a stupid bandage.

819
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:32,949
It's not like I did brain surgery.

820
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:35,607
Think you can blade?
(upbeat pop music)

821
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:36,608

She's at the hotel with Jonathan.

875
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,080
- That's nice dear.

876
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,683
- Well who's with you guys?
Where are his parents?

877
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,230
They're alone.

878
00:51:16,231 --> 00:51:18,189
Jeff, what are you doing?

879
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,457
- I'm gonna get the car keys

880
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:20,879
and I'm gonna go get her.

881
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,269
- Just wait a minute.

882
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,103
All right, Jenny.

883
00:51:23,104 --> 00:51:24,499
Well at least you got
around to calling me.

884
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,059
Give me a call when you're
finished and I'll come get you.

885
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,353
In about an hour, okay?

886
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:30,510
All right.

887
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,479
She's having dinner with Jonathan.

888
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,779
- At the hotel?

889
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,109
Just the two of them.

890
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,110
- [Mom] Apparently.

891
00:51:40,111 --> 00:51:41,492
- Our daughter's with a boy

892
00:51:41,493 --> 00:51:43,429
in a hotel room?

893
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,739
Do you not have a problem with that?

894
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,629
- [Mom] Jeff, they're 12 years old.

895
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,796
- 12 year old girls are having babies.

896
00:51:48,797 --> 00:51:50,579
Read the papers, honey.

897
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,180
- Jenny's not gonna have a baby.

898
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,329
They're having dinner

899
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:58,779
and she's gonna call when they're finished

900
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,280
and I'll run over and get her.

901
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,873
I think it's sweet.

902
00:52:03,986 --> 00:52:06,403
(slow music)

903
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,269
- [Coach] Oh my God.

904
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:47,783
Come on, let's go!

905
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,277
More out there, Kenny!

906
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,530
- I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it!

907
00:53:01,531 --> 00:53:03,448
- I got it, it got it.

908
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,566
- What's the matter with you out there?

909
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:10,947
- You okay?

910
00:53:10,948 --> 00:53:12,624
- Yeah, you okay?

911
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:13,663
- Yeah.

912
00:53:13,664 --> 00:53:14,497
- Are you asleep?

913
00:53:14,498 --> 00:53:16,349
I asked you a question.

914
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:17,539
- No coach.

915
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,753
- [Coach] No coach, what?

916
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,809
- No, I'm not asleep out there.

917
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,379
- That's the kind of stupid mistake

918
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,063
that gets people hurt out here.

919
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,489
Shut up, Victor.

920
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,649
Are you trying to get somebody hurt?

921
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,775
- No.

922
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:33,329
- Dad, it wasn't his fault.

923
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,330
- Stay out of it!

924
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,039
You think or you sit.

925
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,279
Is that clear?

926
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,899
- Yeah.

927
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,399
- You either have your head in the game

928
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,769
or your butt on the bench.
(sirens blaring)

929
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:43,863
Is that clear?

930
00:54:03,982 --> 00:54:06,649
(alarm ringing)

931
00:54:09,314 --> 00:54:10,240
- Kid, where are you going?

932
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,073
You can't go in there.

933
00:54:11,074 --> 00:54:12,313
There's a fire in there!

934
00:54:27,357 --> 00:54:29,190
- Miss, you okay miss?

935
00:54:30,776 --> 00:54:33,026
(coughing)

936
00:54:36,036 --> 00:54:38,786
(sirens blaring)

937
00:54:42,057 --> 00:54:44,974
(flames crackling)

938
00:54:52,194 --> 00:54:55,146
(indistinct radio chatter)

939
00:54:55,147 --> 00:54:56,379
- [Firefighter] Okay
we'll take care of her.

940
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,713
You go with him.

941
00:54:58,689 --> 00:55:02,189
Come on, we won't leave this run, come on.

942
00:55:03,353 --> 00:55:05,099
Ma'am, we'll take you up
and get you out of here.

943
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,100
Come with us.

944
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:10,183
(coughing)

945
00:55:13,488 --> 00:55:17,071
(indistinct radio chatter)

946
00:55:18,209 --> 00:55:20,709
(dog barking)

947
00:55:30,743 --> 00:55:33,860
(siren blaring)

948
00:55:33,861 --> 00:55:34,861
- I'm fine.

949
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:38,434
- You all right?

950
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,538
- Yeah, I'm fine.

951
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:43,380
- You've got some black
stuff on your nose.

952
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,381
- Oh.

953
00:55:45,543 --> 00:55:47,913
- What made you do a
crazy thing like that?

954
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:50,667
- I don't know.

955
00:55:52,029 --> 00:55:53,996
- You could have been killed.

956
00:55:53,997 --> 00:55:55,297
- Hey let's come over here with us.

957
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:56,354
We'll have to check you out.

958
00:55:56,355 --> 00:55:58,242
- No I'm fine, really.

959
00:55:58,243 --> 00:55:59,471
- You have a ride, you all right?

960
00:55:59,472 --> 00:56:00,752
- [Jenny] Yeah, he's coming home with us.

961
00:56:00,753 --> 00:56:02,275
- Now I think I'd like
to listen to his heart.

962
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,536
See what he sounds like.

963
00:56:03,537 --> 00:56:04,414
Come on, come with me.

964
00:56:04,415 --> 00:56:06,497
It'll just take a minute.

965
00:56:07,569 --> 00:56:08,806
- Dad, go get the car.

966
00:56:08,807 --> 00:56:10,857
- Okay, you take care of John, all right?

967
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:32,539
- [Mom] Jonathan, do you need anything?

968
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:33,790
- No thank you, Ms. Neil.

969
00:56:34,948 --> 00:56:36,499
- [Mom] There are plenty
of towels in there.

970
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,028
And you can use the bathrobe
on the hook behind the door.

971
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:40,609
- Okay.

972
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:43,443
(water splashing)

973
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,583
- That's me on my first day of school.

974
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:53,433
That's me when my brother was born.

975
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:57,409
That's me with my parents.

976
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:58,410
And...

977
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,313
- Well let me see!

978
00:57:00,314 --> 00:57:01,829
- You can't.

979
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:03,009
- Why, because you're naked?

980
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,149
- No, you just can't.

981
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:04,983
It's private.

982
00:57:04,984 --> 00:57:06,619
- But you were just a baby!

983
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,620
- I don't care.

984
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:10,899
- I've seen lots of naked babies.

985
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,900
- Where?

986
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,899
- I don't know, I just have.

987
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:16,900
- Sure.

988
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,071
Listen,

989
00:57:20,072 --> 00:57:21,899
I was wondering,

990
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,400
are you going out with anyone?

991
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,219
I mean, I was just
wondering 'cause I'm not.

992
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:32,089
And I mean Tommy said he
would be my boyfriend.

993
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:34,039
But I never said he could be.

994
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,290
And he's been acting
like such a jerk lately.

995
00:57:39,210 --> 00:57:42,253
Um, would you wanna go out with me?

996
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,299
You don't have to tell me right way.

997
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,793
Like, you can think about it.

998
00:57:52,659 --> 00:57:55,369
- Well, I'd like to.

999
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:56,370
But it's...

1000
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,889
I don't know if I can.

1001
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:00,890
- Why not?

1002
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:06,020
- It's strange but when I
try to think about things

1003
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,560
it's like I can't.

1004
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,294
It's weird.

1005
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:13,129
- [Mom] Jonathan, your clothes are dry.

1006
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:14,480
You can change in our room.

1007
00:58:21,803 --> 00:58:23,573
- I heard what you said.

1008
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,203
Jonathan, do you want to go out with me?

1009
00:58:28,107 --> 00:58:30,409
- Do you know what they do to spies?

1010
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:31,919
They shoot them.

1011
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,603
- Heroes, in honor of our hero.

1012
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:39,340
Oh, let me take a picture
of you two before we eat.

1013
00:58:41,586 --> 00:58:44,086
(slow music)

1014
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,069
- [Coach] I hope you
saved some of your heroics

1015
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,549
for tomorrow, John.

1016
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:51,349
Tomorrow's a big one.

1017
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:54,183
- Really Jeff, saving someone's life.

1018
00:58:54,184 --> 00:58:55,733
That's a big one, too.

1019
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:59,510
John, whatever possessed you to do that?

1020
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:10,589
John, don't you think you ought
to give your parents a call?

1021
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:11,839
Let them know you're all right?

1022
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,319
I mean, wow, this has been
all over television all day.

1023
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,239
They probably were
watching from where was it?

1024
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,913
New York, or some city?

1025
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,499
Or someone that you know might be watching

1026
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,199
and give them a call.

1027
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,059
I know how parents worry when
they don't hear from you.

1028
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,493
I think you ought to give them a call.

1029
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:30,730
- Why?

1030
00:59:31,897 --> 00:59:32,730
I don't know anybody.

1031
00:59:32,731 --> 00:59:34,263
Nobody's going to call me.

1032
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,203
I just gotta make my heart better.

1033
00:59:38,644 --> 00:59:39,644
Excuse me.

1034
00:59:50,548 --> 00:59:51,381
(slow music)

1035
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:52,381
- Johnny!

1036
01:01:17,166 --> 01:01:19,086
You know, you didn't have
to buy him all that stuff.

1037
01:01:19,087 --> 01:01:21,402
- Me and Kenny are buddies, right?

1038
01:01:21,403 --> 01:01:24,986
(indistinct movie chatter)

1039
01:01:32,615 --> 01:01:34,667
- [Woman on Screen] Look at that baby!

1040
01:01:34,668 --> 01:01:37,585
(woman screaming)

1041
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:08,679
- Knock it off.

1042
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,149
- You gonna make me?

1043
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:11,150
Moron.

1044
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:17,611
(giggling)

1045
01:02:17,612 --> 01:02:18,694
- [Kids] Shh!

1046
01:02:24,393 --> 01:02:27,726
(giggling)
- [Kids] Shh!

1047
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,233
- So how was tonight?

1048
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:50,099
- Tommy threw popcorn on Jonathan's hair.

1049
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:50,933
- Well, that was mean.

1050
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,519
Why would he do something like that?

1051
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,729
- 'Cause Jonathan was
trying to kiss Jenny.

1052
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:55,680
- [Jenny] He was not.

1053
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,513
- He was too.

1054
01:02:56,514 --> 01:02:57,969
- That's not true.

1055
01:02:57,970 --> 01:02:59,949
- It is, too, I saw him.

1056
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,409
- All right you guys stop it.

1057
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,649
You know, I let you guys go

1058
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:04,318
because I thought you
could act like a bunch of

1059
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:06,044
(car horns honking)

1060
01:03:06,045 --> 01:03:07,045
grownups.

1061
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:09,733
- [Jenny] Are you all right, mom?

1062
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:16,293
- Oh boy, well.

1063
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,549
I think I'm going to have my baby.

1064
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:21,806
- Oh my God, what are we going to do?

1065
01:03:21,807 --> 01:03:22,807
- Are you sure?

1066
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:24,950
- Yeah.

1067
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:25,950
Yeah, I'm sure.

1068
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,903
- Okay, there's more room in the back.

1069
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:34,200
- [Boy] Hey mom, mom.

1070
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,490
I gotta go pee.

1071
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,180
- Oh God.

1072
01:03:40,181 --> 01:03:41,789
- [Jenny] Maybe we should stop a car.

1073
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,499
- Just go all the way back.

1074
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,703
- [Jenny] Mom, you okay?

1075
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:47,279
- What are you doing?

1076
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,380
- Just trying to help.

1077
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:51,580
- Oh!

1078
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:52,509
- You sure you know what you're doing?

1079
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:54,102
- Yeah, yeah.

1080
01:03:54,103 --> 01:03:57,849
(mom moaning)
- Okay, is she all right?

1081
01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:00,449
- Yeah, she's fine.
- You all right, mom?

1082
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:01,803
- Okay okay.

1083
01:04:03,765 --> 01:04:05,015
Breathe, breathe.

1084
01:04:05,016 --> 01:04:06,855
Breathe, breathe.

1085
01:04:06,856 --> 01:04:08,509
- What can I do?
- Breathe, breathe.

1086
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:09,343
Just um,

1087
01:04:09,344 --> 01:04:11,335
do you have any forceps
or anything like that?

1088
01:04:11,336 --> 01:04:13,302
- [Jenny] What do you need forceps for?

1089
01:04:13,303 --> 01:04:15,948
- All right, push push.

1090
01:04:15,949 --> 01:04:17,479
Push, push, push.

1091
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,840
Okay bear down, bear down.

1092
01:04:19,716 --> 01:04:20,859
- We don't have forceps.

1093
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,574
- It's fine, it's fine.

1094
01:04:22,575 --> 01:04:24,950
(mom moaning)

1095
01:04:24,951 --> 01:04:27,319
All right, come here, come here.

1096
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,579
Hold her hand.

1097
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:30,599
Okay, all right.

1098
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,613
(mom panting)

1099
01:04:32,614 --> 01:04:33,447
- Squeeze my hand.

1100
01:04:33,448 --> 01:04:34,499
Keep breathing, keep breathing.

1101
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,500
- Push push push.

1102
01:04:36,725 --> 01:04:38,175
Breathe, breathe, okay, okay.

1103
01:04:39,536 --> 01:04:41,383
(mom panting)
Okay, all right.

1104
01:04:41,384 --> 01:04:43,064
All right, try to relax
okay? Try to relax.

1105
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,745
- I can't believe this is happening.

1106
01:04:45,746 --> 01:04:47,479
- Come here, come here, come here.

1107
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,693
Okay, just try to relax.

1108
01:04:49,811 --> 01:04:50,811
Okay, push.

1109
01:04:51,814 --> 01:04:54,239
- If we had a car phone
we could call somebody.

1110
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,699
Everybody but us has a car phone.

1111
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,539
And a beeper.
- Shut up, Kenny.

1112
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,989
- Kenny, we're gonna have a little....

1113
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:02,149
Ah!

1114
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:03,200
- Big push, big push.

1115
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,365
(mom moaning)
Big push, big push.

1116
01:05:06,366 --> 01:05:11,366
(mom moaning)
(slow piano music)

1117
01:05:14,426 --> 01:05:17,225
(baby crying)
It's a girl.

1118
01:05:17,226 --> 01:05:18,467
- Is she all right?

1119
01:05:18,468 --> 01:05:20,056
- [Jonathan] Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

1120
01:05:20,057 --> 01:05:21,169
- Where have you been?

1121
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:22,270
- [Jenny] It's a girl!

1122
01:05:23,277 --> 01:05:25,777
(baby crying)

1123
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:33,790
- Oh no we have three women in the house?

1124
01:05:44,234 --> 01:05:45,651
- Hi pretty girl.

1125
01:05:47,337 --> 01:05:48,608
- [Mom] What's happening?

1126
01:05:48,609 --> 01:05:50,879
- [Jenny] We're going
to the hospital, mom.

1127
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,379
- [Mom] Who's driving?

1128
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:53,380
- Just relax.

1129
01:05:54,204 --> 01:05:56,199
- Why did it have to be a girl?

1130
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,456
- Be quiet, Kenny.

1131
01:05:57,457 --> 01:05:59,295
(car horn honking)

1132
01:05:59,296 --> 01:06:01,796
(baby crying)

1133
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,905
- Guys, guys, there's a woman in there.

1134
01:06:12,906 --> 01:06:14,156
She has a baby.

1135
01:06:15,807 --> 01:06:16,974
There's blood.

1136
01:06:21,056 --> 01:06:22,056
Stat!

1137
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:28,850
Her pulse is taching.

1138
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:31,690
She's she's hot and diaphoretic.

1139
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:33,541
Come on, Kenny.

1140
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:35,308
(indistinct radio chatter)

1141
01:06:35,309 --> 01:06:37,726
(slow music)

1142
01:06:43,048 --> 01:06:46,881
(indistinct intercom chatter)

1143
01:06:59,665 --> 01:07:01,498
- Excuse me, I'm Jeff.

1144
01:07:33,641 --> 01:07:35,545
- [Jenny] My dad still can't believe it.

1145
01:07:35,546 --> 01:07:37,169
How'd you learn how to do that?

1146
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:39,209
- What, the delivery?

1147
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:41,529
- [Jenny] Yeah, that and driving.

1148
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:43,303
How'd you learn how to drive?

1149
01:07:43,304 --> 01:07:44,304
- Uh I...

1150
01:07:46,321 --> 01:07:47,359
I watch TV.

1151
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,419
- [Jenny] I don't mean
to ask so many questions.

1152
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:52,279
People shouldn't ask so
many questions, you know?

1153
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,843
- Like what you asked me before.

1154
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:56,830
- Yeah.

1155
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:58,836
- [Jonathan] Well I'd like to,

1156
01:07:58,837 --> 01:08:00,789
I just don't know.

1157
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:02,089
- Why not?

1158
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:03,774
- [Jonathan] I feel funny about it.

1159
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:05,363
- What do you mean funny?

1160
01:08:06,201 --> 01:08:07,400
- It's confusing.

1161
01:08:07,401 --> 01:08:09,229
Feels like I don't know anybody.

1162
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:10,509
I mean, I like you.

1163
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:11,813
And I like everybody here.

1164
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:14,720
It just

1165
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:19,109
feels like I'm not going to
be around for much longer.

1166
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:20,760
I mean, I might be, I don't know.

1167
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,520
I can't explain it.

1168
01:08:26,356 --> 01:08:28,206
I don't even know how my parents are.

1169
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:33,069
- What do you think about her, huh?

1170
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:34,609
It's pretty nice, huh?

1171
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,049
There you go, Stevie.

1172
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:36,883
Take that bug.

1173
01:08:36,883 --> 01:08:37,750
Go get yourself something.

1174
01:08:37,751 --> 01:08:39,446
- Let's see what you have there.

1175
01:08:39,447 --> 01:08:41,868
- Oh, she's just newborn.
- She's beautiful!

1176
01:08:41,869 --> 01:08:43,576
Look at her.

1177
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:44,410
- I don't know.

1178
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,169
You don't think it's disgusting?

1179
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:47,549
I think it's disgusting.

1180
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:49,439
- No, actually it's pretty cool.

1181
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,939
Happens every month or so.

1182
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:52,440
The egg goes through the, the

1183
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,209
the fallopian tube.

1184
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:57,279
I saw it on my Grey's Anatomy CD Rom.

1185
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,330
I'll show it to you sometime if you want.

1186
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:04,819
- [Boy] I don't care, I don't
have the money right now.

1187
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:07,419
- [Man] Which one of you
guys is Jonathan Lyle?

1188
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:09,329
- He's the kid batting over there.

1189
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:10,930
- Come on, man.
- [Man] Thanks.

1190
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:15,530
- Aren't you um...

1191
01:09:21,711 --> 01:09:24,864
- Jonathan Lyle?

1192
01:09:24,865 --> 01:09:25,698
Jonathan Lyle?

1193
01:09:25,698 --> 01:09:26,531
- [Jonathan] Yeah.

1194
01:09:26,532 --> 01:09:28,249
- Hi, I'm Dave Winfield.

1195
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:29,679
- Yeah, I know.

1196
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,339
- I'm Aunt Emma's nephew.

1197
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:33,103
The lady you rescued from the fire.

1198
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,319
- Oh yeah, how's she doing?

1199
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,129
- I wish I could say
she was doing all right,

1200
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:38,853
but she's in pretty bad shape.

1201
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,119
But she did want me to come
over here and thank you

1202
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,120
for what you did.

1203
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:47,589
Hey, you know, I liked
the way you were hitting.

1204
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:49,349
You have that wide stance.

1205
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:50,729
Looks like me.

1206
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:52,519
- I can't believe he's
getting batting tips

1207
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,639
from Dave Winfield.

1208
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,199
Why him?

1209
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,299
Who the hell is this kid anyway?

1210
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,170
I don't know,

1211
01:09:59,171 --> 01:10:00,309
but there's something
really weird about him

1212
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:01,909
and I don't like it.

1213
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,419
- Jenny seems to like it.

1214
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,779
- Shut up!

1215
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:06,839
- If you would open up that front hip

1216
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,629
just a little bit earlier,

1217
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:10,380
you'd generate a little more power.

1218
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:12,920
Try it.

1219
01:10:18,816 --> 01:10:19,973
- Hey!

1220
01:10:19,974 --> 01:10:21,399
Oh.

1221
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,483
Hey Mr. Winfield.

1222
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:26,949
- Wow, that's much better.

1223
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:28,150
See what I mean?

1224
01:10:28,151 --> 01:10:30,711
- Well, I think mine's a little bit more

1225
01:10:30,712 --> 01:10:32,809
like Joe DiMaggio.

1226
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:34,189
- That's Jolting Joe all right,

1227
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:37,659
but wasn't that a little before your time?

1228
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:39,636
- A little.

1229
01:10:39,637 --> 01:10:41,239
Thanks.

1230
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,139
- Hey, I'm the one who
should be thanking you.

1231
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:45,190
That was a very brave thing that you did.

1232
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,089
- Well I hope she gets better.

1233
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:49,709
- I do too.

1234
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:52,509
And she mentioned one more thing.

1235
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:54,453
She wanted you to be home by six.

1236
01:10:57,780 --> 01:10:59,563
I think she said you had to change.

1237
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,989
Well, thanks again.

1238
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:05,490
And you take care of yourself.

1239
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:07,579
All right, I'll see you.

1240
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:08,593
- Bye.
- Bye.

1241
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:15,599
- What'd he say, man?
- Yeah, what'd he say?

1242
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,259
- Oh just some stuff about hitting.

1243
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,100
- Why you?

1244
01:11:18,101 --> 01:11:20,039
What's so special about you?

1245
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,145
- Nothing.

1246
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:22,659
- Who the hell do you
think you are anyway?

1247
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:24,710
Acting like you're some kind of big deal.

1248
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:26,763
I know all about you.

1249
01:11:26,764 --> 01:11:28,289
You're some stupid rich kid

1250
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:30,090
whose parents are getting a divorce.

1251
01:11:37,588 --> 01:11:39,780
- Your parents are divorced too, Tommy.

1252
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:48,533
- He didn't mean it.

1253
01:11:48,534 --> 01:11:50,561
People just say things.

1254
01:11:50,562 --> 01:11:52,453
Jonathan, please.

1255
01:11:53,335 --> 01:11:55,409
I don't have to be your girlfriend.

1256
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,829
But I'm still your friend.

1257
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:58,009
And you can tell me anything.

1258
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:00,029
I won't tell anyone.

1259
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:01,569
Not my mom, not my dad.

1260
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:02,570
Not anyone.

1261
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:04,783
- There's nothing to tell.

1262
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:07,189
- Okay.

1263
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,233
- Wait.
(slow music)

1264
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,420
I'm Jonathan Lyle.

1265
01:12:12,421 --> 01:12:13,770
And I live at the hotel and

1266
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:15,909
I just gotta make my heart better.

1267
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:17,403
That's all I know.

1268
01:12:17,404 --> 01:12:19,153
- What do you mean make your heart better?

1269
01:12:19,154 --> 01:12:20,237
Are you sick?

1270
01:12:21,414 --> 01:12:22,997
- No, I'm not sick.

1271
01:12:23,876 --> 01:12:27,376
- What do you mean make your heart better?

1272
01:12:31,618 --> 01:12:32,868
- I don't know.

1273
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:49,189
- Okay gang, this is the big one.

1274
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:50,919
Remember what I said.

1275
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,059
I don't want to see any
stupid mistakes out there.

1276
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,473
Stay focused.

1277
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:58,257
- Coach.

1278
01:12:58,258 --> 01:12:59,489
Can I say something?

1279
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:00,953
- [Coach] Sure John, go ahead.

1280
01:13:03,275 --> 01:13:05,993
- You know, people like Dave Winfield,

1281
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,750
they're professional baseball players,

1282
01:13:12,882 --> 01:13:13,882
but we're not.

1283
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,633
We're just kids.

1284
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:20,693
You only get a chance to be a kid once.

1285
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:23,900
I guess it should be fun,

1286
01:13:26,772 --> 01:13:30,809
but it's not fun when you're
just screaming at us and

1287
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:32,323
calling us lazy or stupid.

1288
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,540
And it's not fun when you're so scared

1289
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:35,640
to make an error that,

1290
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,313
I know how bad you want to win.

1291
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,380
And we all do.

1292
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:45,110
It's just that

1293
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,773
we're kids and it's just baseball,

1294
01:13:49,956 --> 01:13:51,106
and we should have fun.

1295
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:11,623
- Have some fun, all right.

1296
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:13,750
Everybody in here.

1297
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:20,679
Who's gonna win?

1298
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:23,853
Who's gonna wanna go out
there and have some fun?

1299
01:14:23,854 --> 01:14:25,447
- [Team] Giants!

1300
01:14:25,448 --> 01:14:28,412
- [Coach] What, get back in here again.

1301
01:14:28,413 --> 01:14:29,730
Who's gonna have fun?

1302
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:31,064
- [Team] Giants!

1303
01:14:46,837 --> 01:14:49,420
(gentle music)

1304
01:15:03,775 --> 01:15:07,025
(Star Spangled Banner)

1305
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:41,939
- Play ball!

1306
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,957
- [Announcer] It's the Bombless Bombs

1307
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:47,508
leading the league in virtually
every offensive category

1308
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:50,241
up against the comeback kid Giants

1309
01:15:50,242 --> 01:15:51,429
who continue to shock everyone

1310
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:55,689
with upset victories over
the Hawks, Eagles and Aces.

1311
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:56,840
- I know you can do it.

1312
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:00,023
- [Announcer] Little Victor up.

1313
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:03,873
- Hey Victor, I'm proud of you buddy.

1314
01:16:06,184 --> 01:16:08,448
- [Announcer] The pitch, swung!

1315
01:16:08,449 --> 01:16:10,532
(crowd cheering)
Little Victor gets one.

1316
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:13,116
(gentle music)

1317
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,679
Tommy Byer ready to pitch.

1318
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:21,339
He gets the sign.

1319
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,118
He looks in at the hitter.

1320
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:25,803
Here's the wind and the
pitch to Fred Caney.

1321
01:16:25,804 --> 01:16:28,554
(crowd cheering)

1322
01:17:00,647 --> 01:17:03,499
He was gonna need a plane
ticket to catch that one.

1323
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,563
Tommy Byer gets shelled here.

1324
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,633
And the Marlins are going wild.

1325
01:17:14,658 --> 01:17:16,579
Jenny Neil will stand in,

1326
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:18,219
a left hand hitter.

1327
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:19,823
Jenny oh for three on the day.

1328
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:23,685
And here's the pitch.

1329
01:17:23,686 --> 01:17:25,792
Swung and line toward right field.

1330
01:17:25,793 --> 01:17:27,099
It's a base hit.

1331
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,999
It's a tweener gone to the wall.

1332
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,333
Jenny Neil scores second.

1333
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,250
She heads toward third.

1334
01:17:33,251 --> 01:17:36,068
The throw to third is over
the third baseman's head.

1335
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:37,366
Here comes Neil.

1336
01:17:37,367 --> 01:17:39,633
She is going to catch them all.

1337
01:17:39,634 --> 01:17:41,767
Line drive base hit to right center

1338
01:17:41,768 --> 01:17:43,503
and Ace's errors

1339
01:17:43,504 --> 01:17:45,522
and the Giants go ahead, 12 11

1340
01:17:45,523 --> 01:17:47,166
in the sixth inning.

1341
01:17:47,167 --> 01:17:49,519
Jenny Neil going all the way,

1342
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,163
getting hugged by her teammates.

1343
01:17:52,928 --> 01:17:54,572
What a great moment for the Giants.

1344
01:17:54,573 --> 01:17:57,275
And they still have to get three outs

1345
01:17:57,276 --> 01:17:59,362
to win the championship.

1346
01:17:59,363 --> 01:18:02,113
(crowd cheering)

1347
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:38,099
Tommy Byer just one inning
away from a victory.

1348
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,932
He needs three big outs.

1349
01:18:39,933 --> 01:18:41,329
Now he's about ready.

1350
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:42,963
And he deals to Moses.

1351
01:18:47,431 --> 01:18:48,264
(shouting)

1352
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:49,759
Off of Byer's leg.

1353
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,059
Byer goes down.

1354
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,239
Scrambling to his feet
trying to find the baseball

1355
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,320
he fires.

1356
01:18:54,321 --> 01:18:56,154
- He's out, call time!

1357
01:18:57,447 --> 01:18:59,550
(indistinct chatter)

1358
01:18:59,551 --> 01:19:00,624
All right, bud?

1359
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:01,498
- It's okay coach.

1360
01:19:01,499 --> 01:19:03,633
- Hey, just take it easy.

1361
01:19:03,634 --> 01:19:05,482
- Come on, all I need is one more out.

1362
01:19:05,483 --> 01:19:06,316
I can do it.

1363
01:19:06,317 --> 01:19:07,709
- Hey, first thing's first.

1364
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:08,919
Let's see if you can stand.

1365
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:09,920
Come on.

1366
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:14,999
- It's okay.

1367
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,461
- Okay if he throws a few up?

1368
01:19:17,462 --> 01:19:18,631
- [Man] Take as many as you need.

1369
01:19:18,632 --> 01:19:20,039
- Okay.

1370
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,033
- Let's see if you can throw, come on.

1371
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,153
Okay, okay.

1372
01:19:30,154 --> 01:19:31,329
Here it is.

1373
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:33,939
Jed, you're going to relieve Tommy.

1374
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:34,870
You go play first.

1375
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:36,699
You did a great job, buddy.

1376
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:37,533
Come on.

1377
01:19:37,534 --> 01:19:39,599
We only need one more
out and we're the champs.

1378
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,600
Come on.

1379
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:42,380
Your turn.

1380
01:19:52,943 --> 01:19:53,943
Atta boy.

1381
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:56,410
Right like that.

1382
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:03,659
Can you get this guy?

1383
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,149
- Yeah coach, I got him.
- All right let's go.

1384
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:06,609
One more and we're the champs.

1385
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:07,610
Let's go.

1386
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:27,529
- [Announcer] Scott Elliott
will dig in for the Aces.

1387
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:29,419
- Elliott's a right-hander,

1388
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:30,499
and a very strong hitter at that.

1389
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,510
Now Blake threw the one

1390
01:20:32,511 --> 01:20:34,160
and his first pitch

1391
01:20:34,161 --> 01:20:38,281
is in on the ground
foul, outside of third.

1392
01:20:38,282 --> 01:20:39,449
A dog gets it.

1393
01:20:52,843 --> 01:20:55,469
Well the count oh and one with two outs

1394
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:56,816
near the bottom of the sixth.

1395
01:20:56,817 --> 01:20:59,609
The Giants leading 12, 11.

1396
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:01,059
Jed Blake ready to deal.

1397
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:03,039
Scott Elliott digs in.

1398
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:05,944
Now Blake, the right handed to the wild.

1399
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:07,695
And here's the pitch.

1400
01:21:11,462 --> 01:21:12,679
(loud thudding)

1401
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:13,513
It's swung on

1402
01:21:13,514 --> 01:21:16,044
and driven to deep center field.

1403
01:21:16,045 --> 01:21:17,053
That one may go.

1404
01:21:25,957 --> 01:21:28,707
(crowd cheering)

1405
01:21:38,798 --> 01:21:41,631
(camera clicking)

1406
01:21:46,633 --> 01:21:49,383
(crowd cheering)

1407
01:22:07,026 --> 01:22:08,579
Oh my goodness!

1408
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:10,609
What a play by Jonathan Lyle!

1409
01:22:10,610 --> 01:22:14,627
The most unlikely hero who has
saved the day for the Giants.

1410
01:22:14,628 --> 01:22:16,503
They win it all 12, 11

1411
01:22:16,504 --> 01:22:21,171
in one of the greatest endings
ever in baseball history.

1412
01:22:29,338 --> 01:22:32,421
(indistinct chatter)

1413
01:22:35,246 --> 01:22:37,316
Right now we're gonna have Jed
Blake coming to the stands.

1414
01:22:37,317 --> 01:22:40,739
Jed had a league leading
16 batting average.

1415
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:42,693
This should be a proud day for the boy.

1416
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:46,779
Jenny Neil with an
exceptional season this year.

1417
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:49,713
Coach Neil must be extremely proud today.

1418
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,139
And next is Jonathan Lyle

1419
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:59,349
who made one of the most spectacular

1420
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:00,663
catches I've ever seen.

1421
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,289
Jonathan Lyle.

1422
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:04,290
Where is Jonathan?

1423
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:12,913
- Did you send someone to look for John?

1424
01:23:12,914 --> 01:23:14,096
Did you?

1425
01:23:14,097 --> 01:23:15,666
- I don't know.

1426
01:23:15,667 --> 01:23:16,500
- Where's John?

1427
01:23:16,501 --> 01:23:18,649
- It's probably all the fuss
that scared him off, Jen.

1428
01:23:18,650 --> 01:23:20,639
Everybody's got their
friends and family here.

1429
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,879
Jonathan's just being shy.

1430
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:23,713
Believe me.

1431
01:23:23,713 --> 01:23:24,546
- [Man] Come on Jeff,

1432
01:23:24,547 --> 01:23:25,587
we're waiting for your speech.

1433
01:23:25,588 --> 01:23:26,588
- Okay.

1434
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:29,789
Jonathan Lyle.

1435
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:32,299
He's only been with us a short time,

1436
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:35,740
but he's made a very important
contribution to this team

1437
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:39,769
You saw him make the
winning catch out there.

1438
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:43,119
Well John, he showed us
something more important

1439
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,403
than just winning.

1440
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,226
And that's having a good time out there

1441
01:23:47,227 --> 01:23:48,973
and having a lot of fun.

1442
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,620
Well, we had a lot of fun

1443
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:54,959
and thanks to John

1444
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,509
we won this game.

1445
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:59,799
I'd like to thank the
Marlins and my Giants

1446
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,173
for a well-played game.

1447
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:06,569
So John, if you can hear
me, bud, come on back

1448
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:07,720
and enjoy this victory.

1449
01:24:08,881 --> 01:24:10,548
You're a Giant, boy.

1450
01:24:28,864 --> 01:24:29,864
- Kenny.

1451
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:32,809
I know you don't know me

1452
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,703
and you shouldn't talk to strangers.

1453
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,780
Would you do me a favor?

1454
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:41,333
Give this ball to your sister, Jenny?

1455
01:24:42,561 --> 01:24:44,329
- How do you know my name?

1456
01:24:44,330 --> 01:24:45,630
How do you know my sister?

1457
01:24:47,304 --> 01:24:49,554
- Would you do that for me?

1458
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:52,720
Okay?

1459
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,889
- [Boy] What does it say?
- [Kenny] How should I know?

1460
01:24:56,890 --> 01:24:59,029
I thought you said you knew how to read.

1461
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:00,549
- I do.

1462
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:01,550
Come on, let's go.

1463
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:05,106
I know where we could put it.

1464
01:25:05,107 --> 01:25:06,619
We could put it under Jenny's bed.

1465
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:09,058
She wouldn't notice.

1466
01:25:09,059 --> 01:25:10,664
- [Boy] Nah.

1467
01:25:10,665 --> 01:25:13,415
(soft pop music)

1468
01:25:21,438 --> 01:25:22,983
- Jenny.

1469
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:25,151
- What are you doing here?

1470
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:28,843
- What does it say?

1471
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:32,582
- Where'd you get this from?

1472
01:25:32,583 --> 01:25:33,659
- A man gave it to me.

1473
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,017
He said to give it to you.

1474
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:36,950
- What man?

1475
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:37,860
Who was he?

1476
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:38,693
- [Kenny] I don't know.

1477
01:25:38,693 --> 01:25:39,526
Just an old man.

1478
01:25:39,527 --> 01:25:40,653
What does it say?

1479
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,377
- How old?

1480
01:25:43,378 --> 01:25:44,211
- I don't know.

1481
01:25:44,212 --> 01:25:46,203
Just old, like maybe a hundred.

1482
01:25:55,989 --> 01:25:58,406
- Here, bring this back home.

1483
01:25:59,467 --> 01:26:01,384
- And I'm keeping this.

1484
01:26:03,305 --> 01:26:04,627
(cheerful music)

1485
01:26:04,628 --> 01:26:06,508
- And follow hit team.

1486
01:26:06,509 --> 01:26:08,315
It's driving line back.

1487
01:26:08,316 --> 01:26:10,317
Back back back at the wall.

1488
01:26:10,318 --> 01:26:12,151
He leaps, he's got it!

1489
01:26:13,404 --> 01:26:14,404
Oh my God!

1490
01:26:15,569 --> 01:26:18,736
(indistinct shouting)

1491
01:26:20,387 --> 01:26:22,369
- And so I said to him,

1492
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:24,879
as long as you have to
have the painters fee

1493
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,049
for the kitchen,

1494
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:28,163
why not redecorate in here too?

1495
01:26:37,938 --> 01:26:39,938
- Oh Jonathan, Jonathan.

1496
01:26:43,029 --> 01:26:44,135
- What's the matter?

1497
01:26:44,136 --> 01:26:45,149
What happened?

1498
01:26:45,150 --> 01:26:45,983
- It's Emma.

1499
01:26:45,984 --> 01:26:48,410
She passed away just a little while ago.

1500
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:49,509
- It was exactly six o'clock.

1501
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:51,289
She smiled at us,

1502
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:54,019
and she just closed her eyes and was gone.

1503
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:55,199
But she was smiling.

1504
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,869
You know why she was smiling, Jonathan?

1505
01:26:57,870 --> 01:26:59,749
'Cause she fooled us.

1506
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:02,529
Dave Winfield is her nephew.

1507
01:27:02,530 --> 01:27:03,730
- She wasn't fooling us.

1508
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:07,272
She was telling the truth.
- Well that's what I mean,

1509
01:27:07,273 --> 01:27:09,493
What better trickery
than to tell the truth.

1510
01:27:11,553 --> 01:27:14,886
(indistinct TV chatter)

1511
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:19,713
- You're right, Dugan.

1512
01:27:21,707 --> 01:27:23,819
You know when you're right, you're right.

1513
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:27,696
- Jonathan, oh I am so
glad you're back now.

1514
01:27:27,697 --> 01:27:29,779
Now I want your opinion.

1515
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:32,539
What do you think about
the lemon drop yellow

1516
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,479
and the fern green?

1517
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:35,630
What do you think dear?

1518
01:27:37,183 --> 01:27:39,209
- It's very cheerful.

1519
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:40,349
- It's a change.

1520
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:41,629
That's the main thing.

1521
01:27:41,630 --> 01:27:43,229
It's a change.

1522
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:44,279
- You're right.

1523
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,467
- Jonathan we were so
upset about an Emma that

1524
01:27:46,468 --> 01:27:48,729
we didn't even ask you
about the specialist.

1525
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:51,879
- Oh yeah, what did the specialist say?

1526
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,047
- Oh yeah, the specialist.

1527
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:58,423
Well, I suppose that made
my heart better somehow.

1528
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:03,789
Seems I have the heart
of a 12 year old kid.

1529
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:05,839
He said, go on out, have some fun.

1530
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,047
- I'll drink to that.

1531
01:28:07,048 --> 01:28:08,316
- You'll drink to anything.

1532
01:28:08,317 --> 01:28:10,099
- That's a good news item.

1533
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:11,469
- Does this mean that
you're going to have us

1534
01:28:11,470 --> 01:28:15,169
running around outside playing that game?

1535
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:16,189
- Baseball Francis,

1536
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:17,969
it makes us younger.

1537
01:28:17,970 --> 01:28:19,139
- For you it's baseball.

1538
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:20,883
For me it's redecorating.

1539
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:23,749
- Jonathan, it's too bad you didn't get

1540
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,583
to say goodbye to Emma.

1541
01:28:24,584 --> 01:28:26,433
I know how close you two were.

1542
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,500
You're gonna miss her.

1543
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,450
- Sorry, Max, what did you say?

1544
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:36,360
- [Max] I said you're gonna miss her.

1545
01:28:41,678 --> 01:28:42,678
- Yeah.

1546
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:44,990
Going to miss her.

1547
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:53,499
All right then!

1548
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,753
Let's watch a game.

(slow piano music)

1550
01:29:49,870 --> 01:29:51,219
- Have you seen a boy here?

1551
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:52,439
- Checked out.

1552
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:53,440
