1
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,161
Excuse me sir, i
know you've been

2
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:28,714
waiting for an answer
from the states.

3
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:35,055
Mr. David sloan has unwisely
declined your generous offer.

4
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:37,223
Just what did he say?

5
00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:41,729
He was inclined not
to want to cooperate.

6
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,106
What did he say?

7
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:47,027
Sir, he said it would
bra cold day on

8
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,987
mars before he would
ever kiss your ass

9
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:50,573
and that you could kiss his.

10
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:54,326
How unfortunate for mr.
Sloan to misunderstand

11
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:57,914
the business policies of
the negaal federation.

12
00:00:57,915 --> 00:01:00,875
You have 48 hours in which
to eliminate mr. Sloan

13
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:02,796
and enlist the new american
kickboxing champion.

14
00:01:02,823 --> 00:01:04,033
Of course.

Excellent.

25
00:02:51,082 --> 00:02:52,082
Enough.

26
00:02:54,503 --> 00:02:56,630
That's it for today.
Attention.

27
00:02:56,631 --> 00:03:00,008
All: movement without
spirit is nothing.

28
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:04,222
Movement without spirit is nothing.
That's right.

Hey, matt, did you
read the paper today?

00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:20,448
No. Why?

33
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:21,950
Look at this.

34
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:25,453
David sloan was
murdered last night.

35
00:03:25,454 --> 00:03:26,955
What happened?

36
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,749
Well, i don't know.
It says here

37
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,002
it wasn't robbery;
he still had his wallet.

38
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,464
Could i see that?

39
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,886
Matt, anything you
want me to do?

40
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,014
Send flowers to his family?

41
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,810

00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:22,017
You know, you said it would
take 10 before i won the belt.

60

Johnny, you haven't won yet.

61
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:26,147
I won't let you down.

Yeah, me, too.

71
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:44,292
He was a good guy.

But, damn it, you could
have made a lot of bread.

88
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:34,473
There's no money in
kickboxing, max,

You make money either way.

93

utmost importance for you.

Let me see that.

132
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:39,221
Mr. Negaal formed the organization

133
00:08:39,222 --> 00:08:41,599
to bring order out of chaos.

134
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,975

to check it out, right?

I suppose not.

david sloan about joining up.

to put up with anybody's shit.

this is toilet paper.

00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:29,370
Well, then...

186
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:37,086
if you'll excuse me, mr. Styles.

187
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,465
Gentlemen, i'll leave you to it.

188
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:43,969
Mr. Styles,
mr. Negaal makes an offer

189
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,181
once and only once.

190
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:49,518
This opportunity won't be repeated.

191
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,561
Yeah, well, no one's
gonna make me sign

192
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,104
a piece of paper to keep my belt.

193
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:56,567
I won it with these, and that's
the way i plan to keep it.

194
00:11:56,568 --> 00:11:59,654
And that's your final answer?

195
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:00,905
Yeah, 'fraid so.

196
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:03,491
Our apologies if we
offended you, mr. Styles.

197
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:06,204
Maybe some other
time, huh, perhaps?

198
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:17,049

201
00:12:40,868 --> 00:12:42,077
Man.

202
00:12:57,469 --> 00:12:59,137

203
00:12:59,138 --> 00:13:00,723
Whoa!

205
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:31,256
Come on, come on.

206
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:33,843
Go.

207
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:43,979
Come on, my boy.
I've got something for you.

208
00:13:45,732 --> 00:13:47,192

What happened, man?

218
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,531
You were right.
You were right.

219
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:34,328
It was toilet paper.

220
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:38,082
Get 'em, matt.

get to a hospital!

with this guy all over my roof.

226

Shut up, both of you!

227

Hey! This thing doesn't work!
Yeah?

228
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,384
Try talking to the guy with
the antenna up his ass.

229
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:29,931
Oh, bull, you've really screwed
up big-league this time.

230
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,436
Ok. Pull over!

231

Yeah, south africa!

Double-1, double-8-0,2, triple 6.

236
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:13,521
All right, gentlemen, if that
concludes the day's reports.

237
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:15,398
There is one small problem.

238
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,236
This kickboxing federation of
yours is meeting resistance.

239
00:16:19,237 --> 00:16:22,155
All resistance is
being taken care of.

240
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:23,157
By killing them?

241
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:26,160
You don't approve of
my methods, jack?

242
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:30,248
We're making a fortune with
gambling, drugs, and prostitution.

243
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:33,252
Why screw it up with the
kickboxing federation?

244
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:37,047
Man: it's los angeles, sir.
Tell them to hold.

245
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:38,173
Negaal: i'm busy.

246
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:39,342
Jack: we can take all
that cash and put it.

247
00:16:39,343 --> 00:16:41,219
Into parking corporations
in the states.

248
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,222
Do you realize how much
money we could launder?

249
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:48,936
With that in mind, kickboxing
just doesn't make sense.

250
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:50,313
Doesn't make sense?

251
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:56,278
The world kickboxing
council accused me

252
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,863
of unsportsmanlike conduct

253
00:16:57,864 --> 00:17:00,782
when i killed a dutch
champion in the ring.

254
00:17:00,783 --> 00:17:04,620
And just so you know it, jack,
it was a legitimate strike.

255
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:05,746
Hmm.

256
00:17:05,747 --> 00:17:07,582
I formed the negaal
kickboxing federation

257
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,002
to protect the art and the
sport against small minds,

258
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:13,130
and now you have a
problem with this?

259
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:15,299
What doesn't make sense?
No, i... i was just...

260
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,552
i'm gonna break the world
kickboxing council.

261
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:20,053
You got that?

262
00:17:20,054 --> 00:17:22,808
Jack: mr. Negaal, i'm only
trying to serve your interests.

263
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:27,605
Arguing with me doesn't
serve my interests, jack.

[Breathlessly]

265
00:17:49,796 --> 00:17:53,800

Johnny styles... has met
an unfortunate end.

We've been called back to jo-burg.

276
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:29,215
Negaal, voice-over: we have
a situation on our hands.

277
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:31,175
I want matt reeves eliminated.

278
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,970
You can't touch him.
Everyone knows him.

279
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:36,265
He was undefeated in
his weight class.

280
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,933
I don't care who he is.

281
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:39,936
He's a witness.
I want him eliminated.

282
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,065
You have a problem with that, jack?

283
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:46,818
I didn't think so.

284
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:48,152

00:18:48,153 --> 00:18:51,990

the job in los angeles.

Isn't he in jail?

287
00:18:53,368 --> 00:18:56,120
We can get him out. We have
a judge on the payroll.

288
00:18:56,121 --> 00:18:57,871
I though this confinement

289
00:18:57,872 --> 00:18:59,248
to maximum security suited you.

290
00:18:59,249 --> 00:19:02,210
Yeah, i was a handsome man
before he did this to me...

291

but i wouldn't mind
seeing him again.

last time you fought. Yeah.

You're talking about organized
crime based overseas.

These murders aren't just
impossible to prove,

they're impossible
to do anything about

evidence, and all

00:55:58,274 --> 00:56:01,443
Think about that, mr. Bollen.

731
00:56:01,444 --> 00:56:03,029
Get this useless sack out of here.

732
00:56:05,573 --> 00:56:07,618
[Snort]

733
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:13,664
you want to tell me
where we're headed?

734
00:56:13,665 --> 00:56:14,666
Home.

735
00:56:16,085 --> 00:56:18,796
Why? What's there?

736
00:56:18,797 --> 00:56:19,797
Safety.

737
00:56:25,137 --> 00:56:26,347
Pull over!

738
00:56:28,808 --> 00:56:29,808
Please.

739
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,316
Haven't you figured it out yet?

740
00:56:37,317 --> 00:56:38,609
I don't want safety.

741
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:40,571
I want negaal.

742
00:56:45,243 --> 00:56:46,785
So do you, croft.

743
00:56:46,786 --> 00:56:48,287
You want negaal as bad as i do,

744
00:56:48,288 --> 00:56:49,622
but you're afraid of him,

745
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:50,790
of getting involved.

746
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:54,210
You think he's just
gonna forget about you?

747
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:55,795
You screwed him over.

748
00:56:55,796 --> 00:56:58,298
He'll hunt you down, and after
he's killed you and your family,

749
00:56:58,299 --> 00:56:59,884
he'll find someone else to murder.

750
00:57:02,387 --> 00:57:03,596
We have to stop him.

751
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:07,517
If we don't and
another person dies,

752
00:57:07,518 --> 00:57:08,727
it's our fault.

753
00:57:16,611 --> 00:57:18,279
What is going on?

754
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,488
Who is this guy?

755
00:57:19,489 --> 00:57:21,742
God damn pain in the
ass, that's who he is.

756
00:57:24,537 --> 00:57:27,080
Matt, wait! Wait!

757
00:57:27,081 --> 00:57:28,498
Do you even know where you are?

758
00:57:28,499 --> 00:57:29,959
You're in a foreign country.

759
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,545
You got no money. We got the
police after us with dogs.

760
00:57:32,546 --> 00:57:34,506
You're in the middle of a
god damn spinach patch.

761
00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:37,161
You think you're gonna
find negaal out here?

762
00:57:38,595 --> 00:57:40,304
All right.
I'll help you,

763
00:57:40,305 --> 00:57:43,307
but you don't know negaal.
I do.

764
00:57:43,308 --> 00:57:44,766
Let's go back to my home

765
00:57:44,767 --> 00:57:46,311
and get ourselves together.

766
00:57:46,312 --> 00:57:48,814
Then we'll come up with a plan.

767
00:57:52,359 --> 00:57:54,738
All right.
All right.

768
00:58:04,916 --> 00:58:06,625
Angie, this is matt reeves.

769
00:58:06,626 --> 00:58:09,711
He'll be staying with us
for a couple of days.

770
00:58:09,712 --> 00:58:10,712
Hi, angie.
Hi.

771
00:58:31,946 --> 00:58:33,155
Are you negaal?

772
00:58:35,366 --> 00:58:38,702
I understand you don't
approve of my title.

773
00:58:38,703 --> 00:58:40,204
The federation doesn't
recognize you

774
00:58:40,205 --> 00:58:42,122
until you recognize the federation.

775
00:58:42,123 --> 00:58:45,627
Well, i hardly think you have
anything to say in the matter.

776
00:58:45,628 --> 00:58:48,755
Well, perhaps you'd like
to prove how good you are.

777
00:58:48,756 --> 00:58:50,675
How good i am?

778
00:58:55,263 --> 00:58:56,681
Against whom?

779
00:58:56,682 --> 00:58:59,017
Oh, i don't know.

780
00:59:00,394 --> 00:59:01,812
Me.

781
00:59:01,813 --> 00:59:03,897
You? Ha ha ha!

782
00:59:03,898 --> 00:59:05,691
Heh heh heh.

783
00:59:05,692 --> 00:59:08,944
Well, perhaps it might provide
a minute or two of amusement

784
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:10,822
and teach you some respect

785
00:59:10,823 --> 00:59:12,031
for your superiors.

786
00:59:12,032 --> 00:59:13,449
Well, it's a lovely day out there.

787
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,203
Perhaps you'd like to give
me this lesson on the lawn?

788
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,792
On the lawn? Ha!

789
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:23,378
Ja. Gut. On the lawn.

790
00:59:59,168 --> 01:00:00,461
Ohh!

791
01:00:00,462 --> 01:00:02,504
Ha ha ha! Huh?

792
01:00:02,505 --> 01:00:05,550
You want to fight? Huh?

793
01:00:07,552 --> 01:00:09,889
Ha ha ha! Huh?

794
01:00:10,973 --> 01:00:12,933
You want some more?

795
01:00:36,168 --> 01:00:38,587
Unh! Ohh!

796
01:00:41,091 --> 01:00:43,092
I concede.
You're a great fighter.

797
01:00:43,093 --> 01:00:44,593
I acknowledge your superiority.

798
01:00:44,594 --> 01:00:47,012
The opportunity for
that was earlier.

799
01:00:47,013 --> 01:00:49,974
A challenge to me is a
challenge to the death.

800
01:00:49,975 --> 01:00:51,560
What? Are you insane?

801
01:00:52,353 --> 01:00:53,562
Come.

802
01:00:55,231 --> 01:00:56,440
Come.

803
01:00:56,857 --> 01:00:58,068
Come!

804
01:00:59,694 --> 01:01:01,738
You are joking.

805
01:01:02,906 --> 01:01:05,117
Haah!

806
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:26,349
I represent the new, higher
standard of world kickboxing.

807
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,311
You represent the old.

808
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,611
Bollen: hey, gents.
You must watch this.

809
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:39,780
The tiger claw.

810
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:41,448
It's good, it's good.

811
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:44,035
He'll crush his throat.

812
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,584
Ohh!

813
01:02:01,638 --> 01:02:03,223
Good fight, boss.
Good fight!

814
01:02:09,772 --> 01:02:12,232
Not too much lime this time, sir?

815
01:02:12,233 --> 01:02:13,444
Better.

816
01:02:19,533 --> 01:02:23,120
Gentlemen, good afternoon.

817
01:02:23,121 --> 01:02:24,455
I'm going for a swim.

818
01:02:24,456 --> 01:02:26,165
And, uh, please don't forget,

819
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:27,499
my place tomorrow night.

820
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,959
We're celebrating the formation

821
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,213
of our new empire,

822
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:33,048
the negaal federation.

823
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,675
Champagne, gambling, entertainment.

824
01:02:35,676 --> 01:02:37,971
It's all on me.

825
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:40,848
Well, gentlemen.
Ahem.

826
01:02:40,849 --> 01:02:43,434
So much for art in the park.

827
01:02:43,435 --> 01:02:46,396
Who knows what dinner will bring?

828
01:02:46,397 --> 01:02:47,982
Shall we?

829
01:03:08,296 --> 01:03:09,631
Ahem.

830
01:03:10,882 --> 01:03:14,345
So how long have you
two been together?

831
01:03:16,722 --> 01:03:17,932
Since birth.

832
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:20,810
He's my brother.

833
01:03:24,439 --> 01:03:26,279
You know, i really thought
that you two were...

834
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:30,737
look. I'm gonna ask
you one last time.

835
01:03:30,738 --> 01:03:32,864
What is going on?

836
01:03:32,865 --> 01:03:34,450
And this time, i want an answer.

837
01:03:39,707 --> 01:03:41,374
Do you know of a man named negaal?

838
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:45,838
I know he's the reason paul hasn't
been home for the past 5 years.

839
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:47,279
Well, he murdered
two of my friends,

840
01:03:47,306 --> 01:03:48,924
and the police can't touch him.

841
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:51,218
And just what are you
gonna do about it?

842
01:03:51,219 --> 01:03:52,386
Stop him...

843
01:03:52,387 --> 01:03:56,224
and carry out a promise
i made to a friend.

844
01:03:56,225 --> 01:03:58,685
And you're going with him?

845
01:03:58,686 --> 01:03:59,895
I have to.

846
01:04:01,356 --> 01:04:03,358
Dad would beery proud of you, paul.

847
01:04:13,703 --> 01:04:16,663
Look. I'm sorry, matt,

848
01:04:16,664 --> 01:04:18,541
but i love my brother,

849
01:04:18,542 --> 01:04:20,710
and i'm grateful he's home,

850
01:04:20,711 --> 01:04:24,380
but i can't let you pull
him back into that world.

851
01:04:24,381 --> 01:04:27,885
Angie, i'm not pulling him back.

852
01:04:27,886 --> 01:04:29,178
It's his decision.

853
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:32,473
Our father died while his
only son was in prison.

854
01:04:32,474 --> 01:04:35,852
You know, maybe you need
to have some faith.

855
01:04:35,853 --> 01:04:37,688
Your brother is a good man.

856
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:51,953
Angie: you know you can't go
up against negaal and bollen.

857
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:55,040
Bollen hates you for
what you did to him.

858
01:04:55,041 --> 01:04:57,793
They'll kill you if
you get in their way.

859
01:04:57,794 --> 01:05:01,756
Please, paul, just
leave them alone.

860
01:05:01,757 --> 01:05:04,133
I'm already in their way, angie.

861
01:05:04,134 --> 01:05:05,218
Negaal's put the word out

862
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:06,719
to have matt and me killed.

863
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,555
Paul, no.

864
01:05:08,556 --> 01:05:11,683
This isn't just gonna go away.

865
01:05:11,684 --> 01:05:13,685
For all the terrible things
i've done in my life,

866
01:05:13,686 --> 01:05:17,357
now's the chance for
me to redeem myself.

867
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:19,567
I've got to help him.

868
01:05:19,568 --> 01:05:21,903
By going after negaal?

869
01:05:21,904 --> 01:05:22,904
Yes.

870
01:05:59,738 --> 01:06:02,533
[Sheep bleating]

871
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:28,921
good morning.

872
01:07:29,756 --> 01:07:30,756
Morning.

873
01:07:32,551 --> 01:07:33,717
Thanks.

874
01:07:33,718 --> 01:07:34,718
Pleasure.

875
01:07:37,389 --> 01:07:40,725
Angie, he will be back.

876
01:07:40,726 --> 01:07:43,520
I know he'll be back.

877
01:07:43,521 --> 01:07:45,815
I'm going with you.

878
01:08:07,006 --> 01:08:08,674
Hyah!

879
01:08:17,809 --> 01:08:19,226
Moon has secured the area,

880
01:08:19,227 --> 01:08:20,895
and there's tito
with the investors.

881
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:22,536
This is a very important
evening, bollen.

882
01:08:22,537 --> 01:08:24,217
There are a lot of
influential people here.

883
01:08:24,218 --> 01:08:26,372
Don't worry, sir.
Everything's been arranged.

884
01:08:26,373 --> 01:08:27,737
You better be right.

885
01:08:28,822 --> 01:08:30,865
Ha ha ha! Tito.

886
01:08:30,866 --> 01:08:32,701
Welcome, gentlemen.welcome.

887
01:08:34,953 --> 01:08:35,953
A couple of pictures.

888
01:08:35,954 --> 01:08:38,124
Yes, sir, mr. Negaal.

889
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:41,168
One for each of my guests.

890
01:08:41,169 --> 01:08:43,170
Gentlemen, shall we?

891
01:08:43,171 --> 01:08:44,757
Bollen: gonna have
some fun tonight.

892
01:08:49,386 --> 01:08:51,137
Let's go around the back.

893
01:08:51,138 --> 01:08:52,513
All right.

894
01:08:52,514 --> 01:08:54,600
Angie, i'm sorry. You're
gonna have to wait outside.

895
01:08:54,601 --> 01:08:55,809
Paul, you said that i could...

896
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:57,570
we need you out herewith
the engine running.

897
01:08:57,597 --> 01:08:59,563
If we're not back in
half an hour, go home.

898
01:08:59,564 --> 01:09:00,564
Matt, wait...

899
01:09:00,565 --> 01:09:02,109
angie, we'll be all right.

900
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:04,779
Yeah, right.

901
01:09:14,206 --> 01:09:17,333
Gentlemen, a game of roulette.

902
01:09:17,334 --> 01:09:19,044
Some chips for my guests.

903
01:09:19,045 --> 01:09:20,880
Eagle eyes, buttie.

904
01:09:24,384 --> 01:09:25,593
Oh.

905
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:30,807
Hi.
Hi.

906
01:09:30,808 --> 01:09:31,891
Excuse me, gentlemen.

907
01:09:31,892 --> 01:09:32,892
How can we help you?

908
01:09:32,893 --> 01:09:33,769
Ah, yes. We're here for the party.

909
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,270
This is a private event.

910
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:36,647
Engraved invitations only.

911
01:09:36,648 --> 01:09:39,066
Don't worry. Mr. Negaal will
be pleasantly surprised.

912
01:09:39,067 --> 01:09:41,568
He's been looking all
over town for us.

913
01:09:41,569 --> 01:09:42,611
Thanks.

Besides, you're violating
the dress code.

The one and only.

927
01:10:59,866 --> 01:11:03,494
And there's your old friend bollen.

but i think i'll try my luck.

Excuse me.

931
01:11:17,511 --> 01:11:19,387
May i use this?

Yes, sir.

933
01:11:32,194 --> 01:11:33,403
Reeves is here.

934
01:11:35,989 --> 01:11:36,989
What?

935
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:38,866
Negaal is gonna kill me.

936
01:11:38,867 --> 01:11:40,787
I'll get the others.

Hey, bollen.

943

Oh, croft.

944
01:12:10,903 --> 01:12:14,532
I've been waiting a long
time for this, buttie.

945
01:12:14,533 --> 01:12:15,700
Your head looks good.

946
01:12:15,701 --> 01:12:16,951
Thought i ripped that ear off.

947
01:12:16,952 --> 01:12:19,078
You know, somebody threw
it back into the ring

948
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:20,289
after you left.

949
01:12:24,961 --> 01:12:26,128
I spent 3 years in prison

950
01:12:26,129 --> 01:12:27,254
because of you, bollen.

951
01:12:27,255 --> 01:12:29,048
You set me up!

952
01:12:31,218 --> 01:12:34,178
Yeah? Well, you would have been
helpful to the organization

953

had you killed reeves.

954
01:12:35,347 --> 01:12:36,764

not be such a good idea.

01:13:28,866 --> 01:13:30,241
Why don't you pick a number,

969
01:13:30,242 --> 01:13:32,911

970
01:13:32,912 --> 01:13:38,376

971
01:13:38,377 --> 01:13:42,714
What about... all
of it on 35?

who the hell are you?

973
01:13:47,512 --> 01:13:51,264
Just another dude from the valley.

974
01:13:51,265 --> 01:13:55,646
Of course.
You must be matt reeves.

975
01:13:56,689 --> 01:13:58,648
You're not what i expected.

976
01:13:58,649 --> 01:14:00,775
You're just a kid.

977
01:14:00,776 --> 01:14:03,612
Well, you're exactly
what i expected,

978
01:14:03,613 --> 01:14:04,823
a butt face.

979
01:14:21,842 --> 01:14:24,719
Paul:
you're a dead man, bollen.

980
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,929
Get up!

981
01:14:27,056 --> 01:14:28,266
Please don't kill me.

982
01:14:29,851 --> 01:14:30,851
Please don't kill me.

983
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:33,479
Please don't.

984
01:14:35,232 --> 01:14:38,693
Matt: ladies and gentlemen, may
i have your attention, please?

985
01:14:38,694 --> 01:14:41,029
I would just like
to take this moment

986
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:42,822
to congratulate mr. Negaal

987
01:14:42,823 --> 01:14:47,244
and his newly founded negaal
kickboxing federation.

988
01:14:47,245 --> 01:14:48,454
[Applause]

989
01:14:48,455 --> 01:14:50,831
the federation was formed
because mr. Negaal,

990
01:14:50,832 --> 01:14:52,876
a former kickboxer himself,

991
01:14:52,877 --> 01:14:55,754
was kicked out and
banned from competition

992
01:14:55,755 --> 01:14:59,299
for using an illegal move
and killing his opponent.

993
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:01,677
He now has his own organization...

994
01:15:01,678 --> 01:15:04,638
we need to get him
out of here, tito.

995
01:15:04,639 --> 01:15:08,644
Should they refuse, well,
he kills them, too.

996
01:15:11,022 --> 01:15:13,815
Two of my friends are
dead because of this man.

997
01:15:13,816 --> 01:15:16,819
At least they fought
and died with dignity,

998
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:18,446
which is more than most men do.

999
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:21,449
You're a gangster,
a murderer, and a psychopath.

1000
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:25,037
Anyone who's willing to
be seen with you is dirt.

1001
01:15:25,038 --> 01:15:26,955
What you lack in intelligence

1002
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:30,000
you make up for in passion.

1003
01:15:30,001 --> 01:15:31,543
I like that.

1004
01:15:31,544 --> 01:15:35,715
Unfortunately, your friend johnny
suffered the same dilemma.

1005
01:15:35,716 --> 01:15:37,008
To the house, tito.

1006
01:15:37,009 --> 01:15:39,804
I don't wish to be part of
this undignified brawl.

1007
01:15:46,895 --> 01:15:48,897
If he's worthy of me,
he'll come.

1008
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:04,247
Hyah!

1009
01:16:04,248 --> 01:16:05,833

1016
01:17:05,859 --> 01:17:06,859
Call the cops.

1017
01:17:10,822 --> 01:17:13,826
I think it's time we found
ourselves another job, huh?

1018
01:17:16,662 --> 01:17:17,872
Yeah.

1019
01:17:25,047 --> 01:17:27,298
Well, that party was a
glittering success.

1020
01:17:27,299 --> 01:17:28,884
You can wave your empire good-bye.

1021
01:17:30,721 --> 01:17:31,721
Oh, really?

1022
01:17:31,722 --> 01:17:33,138

i put it... dangerous.

1027
01:17:44,693 --> 01:17:46,820
I don't need them.

1028
01:17:46,821 --> 01:17:49,156
Do you think famous champions

1029
01:17:49,157 --> 01:17:50,783
can disappear off the
face of the earth

1030
01:17:50,784 --> 01:17:53,244
and nobody will bloody notice?

1031
01:17:53,245 --> 01:17:54,746
It happens all the time.

1033
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:58,250
Oh, right.

1034
01:17:58,251 --> 01:18:01,795
Except they either got on
a plane for south africa

1035
01:18:01,796 --> 01:18:04,840
to join the negaal
kickboxing federation

1036
01:18:04,841 --> 01:18:06,759
or they received your letter

1037
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,387
on your letterhead
inviting them to.

1038
01:18:09,388 --> 01:18:10,764
Enough!

1039
01:18:12,684 --> 01:18:15,310
We can discuss this
some other time, tito.

1040

1044
01:18:37,545 --> 01:18:39,963
You killed my friends.

1045

You're right.
I did.

1046

Isn't that something?

You're never gonna kill
or hurt anyone again.

1050
01:18:55,315 --> 01:18:56,899
Dying to fight, are we?

1051
01:19:07,077 --> 01:19:09,079
Our time, mr. Reeves, has come!

Never have them.
