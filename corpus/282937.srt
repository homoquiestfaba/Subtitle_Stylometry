00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:28,685
Chaos

4
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:44,394
Here you are, sir.

5
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:14,792
Shall I?

6
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:16,557
Yes.

7
00:01:41,494 --> 00:01:41,926
There.

8
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:43,223
Thanks.

9
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:48,391
We should`ve had Chinese.

10
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:50,669
Chopsticks are worse.

11
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:52,201
You’re right.

12
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:30,407
Your signature.

13
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:36,512
It was delicious.

14
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:56,328
Thank you.

15
00:02:58,871 --> 00:02:59,929
Thanks.

16
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:47,746
They’re all waiting.

17
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:49,048
Thanks.

18
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,788
Did my wife call?

19
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:54,449
No. I thought she was dining with you.

20
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:55,822
She was...

21
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:57,758
That’s fine, then.

22
00:04:20,953 --> 00:04:21,920
Yes.

23
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:26,951
You have a call from
the Meiwa Bank. A Mr. Sato.

24
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:29,960
Meiwa Bank? Put him through.

25
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:31,960
Right away.

26
00:04:34,734 --> 00:04:36,759
Komiyama speaking.

27
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:39,095
I’ve got your wife.

28
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:40,471
What?

29
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:44,067
Komiyama Saori.
Your wife, right?

30
00:04:44,977 --> 00:04:45,409
Oh, I see.

31
00:04:45,778 --> 00:04:48,770
I’m said, I’ve kidnapped her.

32
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:54,013
Is this a joke?

33
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:58,022
How was your lunch at "L"?

34
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,118
Who... just who are you?

35
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,958
Are you Iistening? I’m the man
that kidnapped your wife.

36
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,862
Saori, where’s Saori?

37
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,402
With me.

38
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:14,871
Put her on.

39
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:16,406
Impossible.

40
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:17,600
Why?

41
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:23,677
We just finished fucking.
She’s out of breath.

42
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,078
How dare you!

43
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:30,087
She’s some broad.
Your wife.

44
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:31,849
Put her on!

45
00:05:32,024 --> 00:05:36,017
Ooooh, tough! Hold on.

46
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:40,723
Your hubby.

47
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:44,029
Hello.

48
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:45,863
Saori?

49
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:47,795
Darling.

50
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,500
You’re not hurt, you’re OK?

51
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:52,144
Yes.

52
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,710
Where are you?

53
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,078
I don’t know.

54
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:01,879
No personal questions now.

55
00:06:02,054 --> 00:06:04,022
She’d better be OK.

56
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:06,021
You heard her.

57
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:07,649
Don’t touch her.

58
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,464
Don’t you worry.
She’s precious merchandise.

59
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:19,128
She’s got Fragile stickers all over.

60
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:21,530
What was that?

61
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:23,132
Nothing.

62
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:24,470
What did you do?

63
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:25,542
Nothing.

64
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:26,634
I heard her.

65
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:28,576
Enough. I’ll hang up.

66
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:32,708
Wait. I understand.
How much do you want?


67
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,715
Thirty million.

68
00:06:36,823 --> 00:06:37,949
Thirty million...

69
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:43,553
For starters, thirty million yen, cash.
Noon tomorrow.

70
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:47,998
I’ll call your house with instructions.

71
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:57,676
Ready?

72
00:06:57,844 --> 00:06:58,606
Yes.

73
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:01,179
This is Location 1. We’re ready.

74
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:07,747
We’re connected.

75
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:25,063
The last time you saw your wife
was at the Restaurant "L"?

76
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:30,767
Yes. She went out while I was paying.

77
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:37,140
I thought she’d wait, but
when I got out, she was gone.

78
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:39,812
How long was that?

79
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,150
Two, three minutes.

80
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:51,788
Do you remember seeing any
suspicious-looking men or vehicles?

81
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:54,054
No.


82
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:03,305
And the perp asked you
about your meal at "L"?

83
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:04,574
Yes.

84
00:08:04,744 --> 00:08:06,803
Did you look for her?

85
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:09,009
No.

86
00:08:11,217 --> 00:08:12,514
I see...

87
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:15,183
I was late for a meeting.

88
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:17,047
I see.

89
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:25,328
Do you think that’s when he got her?

90
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:31,097
It’s too soon to tell, but probably so.

91
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:35,172
It’s my fault.

92
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,837
If only I’d looked for her then...

93
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,583
My office.

94
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:23,319
Hello.

95
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:24,719
It can wait.

96
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:30,660
Excuse me. It’s from Mr. Sato at
Meiwa Bank, about yesterday’s loan.

97
00:09:30,763 --> 00:09:33,789
He’s left an urgent message.

98
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:34,924
Sato from Meiwa!

99
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:38,400
Yes. Are you ready?

100
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:40,165
Go ahead.

101
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,365
Dial #85O1,

102
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:47,770
Followed by 3221-3757.

103
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:51,749
Punch in his personal code 1102.

104
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,112
Repeat that.

105
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:54,284
May I?

106
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:55,319
Yes.

107
00:09:55,454 --> 00:10:02,951
After dialing #8501, you dial322...

108
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:05,428
Got it. Thanks.

109
00:10:06,365 --> 00:10:08,993
Location 1 calling. Any luck?

110
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,130
OK. Roger on that.

111
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:17,437
No luck tracing it.


112
00:10:18,044 --> 00:10:19,978
It’s blocked.

113
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:21,943
A voice mail system.

114
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:26,313
Yeah. Impossible to trace.

115
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:29,117
The phone company?

116
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:30,950
Not now.

117
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:33,723
Please make the call...

118
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:34,985
OK.

119
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:47,167
The number matches
your number here.

120
00:10:47,406 --> 00:10:49,897
This is the Voice Mailbox...

121
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,374
And the code?

122
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:55,803
11O2. That’s Saori`s birthday!

123
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:58,215
November second.

124
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:08,385
Enter your mailbox number
and press the pound sign.

125
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:17,899
You have one new message.

126
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:25,140
Put the thirty million in shopping
bag and seal it with tape.

127
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:28,242
Take it and get in a taxi.

128
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:32,944
Go to the Hanyu rest area
on the Northeast Expressway.

129
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:38,990
You have until 2PM.
If you don’t show up, the deal`s off.

130
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:45,930
If a cop drives the taxi, or I see
anything suspicious, it’s all off.

131
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:51,199
Can we make it?

132
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:54,005
I think so.

133
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:59,942
How will he find me at the rest area?

134
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:02,073
Mr. Komiyama.

135
00:12:02,414 --> 00:12:03,381
Yes.

136
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:08,954
The perp might be watching now.
Try not to talk to me.

137
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,978
Saori will die.

138
00:12:33,512 --> 00:12:36,345
He didn’t follow the rules.

139
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:41,452
Don’t tell the cops.
Otherwise they both die.

140
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:06,374
This is the Kuriharas`.

141
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:11,072
I`m killing your sister.

142
00:13:13,052 --> 00:13:15,111
Who is this?

143
00:13:17,223 --> 00:13:21,557
Your brother’s wife.
You know she’s been kidnapped.

144
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:23,058
Oh...

145
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:27,562
Your brother broke the rules.

146
00:13:28,434 --> 00:13:30,368
So she dies.

147
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:32,493
Wait, just wait.

148
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:38,199
If you want her alive, bring all the
money in the house to Asagaya station.

149
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:41,609
I`ll meet you at platform 2.

150
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:46,441
If you’re not there by 2,
I’ll kill Saori.

151
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,178
But I don’t have...

152
00:13:49,355 --> 00:13:51,084
You bringing it or not!

153
00:13:51,257 --> 00:13:52,349
Yes.

154
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:55,653
You Saeko?

155
00:13:56,428 --> 00:13:57,360
What?

156
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:03,367
You know, I don’t just have Saori.

157
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,572
I`ve got your son, too.

158
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:07,539
What!

159
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:13,042
Listen up. Don’t you dare tell the cops.
Or your brother.

160
00:14:14,246 --> 00:14:18,114
Talk, and they’re both dead.

161
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,248
Yes. I understand.

162
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:22,333
Welcome.
Please deposit your parking fee.

163
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:31,515
Thank you.

164
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:12,344
This is Ebara AII-Serve.
I can’t take your call right now.


165
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:19,590
Please leave your name and number
after the tone and I`ll call you back.

166
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:24,662
Hello, this is Tashiro Minoru.

167
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:30,524
I’ve been visiting my son and his wife.

168
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:34,428
I need a "Go" partner.

169
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:37,806
How about a game of Go?

170
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,871
My number is 3752-4460.

171
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,775
I hope you`ll return my call.

172
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:08,728
Yes?

173
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:11,333
Who are you?

174
00:19:15,347 --> 00:19:17,713
I’m Komiyama.

175
00:19:20,352 --> 00:19:21,614
What happened?

176
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:28,450
I disguised myself, by wearing
clothes I’d never choose.

177
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:29,425
Disguise?

178
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:30,495
Yes.

179
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:32,260
Why on earth?

180
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:35,659
I just had lunch with my husband.

181
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:37,569
And?

182
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:40,766
At a French restaurant called "L".

183
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,276
May l?

184
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:51,446
Yes...

185
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:04,858
I left while he was settling the bill.
Of course no one saw me.

186
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:09,963
I was wearing these.

187
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:14,538
You look like a kid.

188
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:19,536
My husband will fall for it.

189
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:23,578
Aren’t we bossy.

190
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:31,055
Here.

191
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,748
What `s that?

192
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,723
A million.

193
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:43,758
That`ll cover it right?

194
00:20:44,636 --> 00:20:45,796
The kidnapping.

195
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:07,017
Thanks.

196
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:18,828
Don’t worry. I washed it.

197
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:21,904
Oh, thanks.

198
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:30,941
What is it?

199
00:21:31,817 --> 00:21:39,121
It’s just that um...
I hadn’t noticed yesterday,

200
00:21:39,691 --> 00:21:42,023
but haven’t we met before?

201
00:21:43,695 --> 00:21:46,664
No, l don’t think so.

202
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:49,664
l see...

203
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:53,935
I certainly don’t dress this way.

204
00:21:56,675 --> 00:21:59,974
Right. Sorry.

205
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:01,973
Not at all.

206
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:19,758
I figured out a place to
hide while I’m kidnapped.

207
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,099
What?

208
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:29,940
My college friend, Soma Rumi,
happens to be in America now.

209
00:22:31,042 --> 00:22:36,446
She asked me to feed her tropical fish,
so l have her keys.

210
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:41,051
You think of everything.

211
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:42,780
That bother you?

212
00:22:42,954 --> 00:22:47,948
No. Does your husband know?

213
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:49,721
I didn’t tell him.

214
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:54,054
When does she return?

215
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,734
Next Monday.

216
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:00,596
I see.

217
00:23:02,073 --> 00:23:03,700
What do you say?

218
00:23:05,911 --> 00:23:07,606
You’re serious.

219
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,672
I told you l was.

220
00:23:12,184 --> 00:23:15,984
Yes. Sorry.

221
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:28,690
And once you’re free.

222
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,932
What?

223
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:35,629
When you’re kidnapped,
your husband will call the police.

224
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,040
if not at first,

225
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:43,737
then definitely after you get home.

226
00:23:44,683 --> 00:23:49,245
We need a dose of reality
to make it convincing.

227
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:51,554
Reality?

228
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:57,988
Yes. Besides, l don’t want to get
caught by the cops either.

229
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,075
Which apartment?

230
00:24:21,186 --> 00:24:22,084
303.

231
00:24:22,854 --> 00:24:28,952
You go ahead.
Make sure no one sees you go in.

232
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:30,925
And you, Handyman?

233
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:33,754
I got stuff to do.

234
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,967
OK.

235
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:05,882
l`ll make the first call now.

236
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:08,059
Yes.

237
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:11,862
Let’s go over a few details.

238
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,358
Yes.

239
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:20,805
Komiyama Saori was abducted near
"L" and confined somewhere.

240
00:26:21,272 --> 00:26:24,002
Always remember that premise.

241
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:26,275
Yes.

242
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:31,216
That where, is of course not here.

243
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:36,745
Meaning you leave no evidence
of having been here.

244
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:38,955
Yes.

245
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:43,994
First, don’t go touching anything.


246
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,390
Yes.

247
00:26:46,464 --> 00:26:50,400
Second, keep
the curtains shut, like this.

248
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:52,203
Yes.

249
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,803
When you need a light, use this.

250
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:01,939
Yes.

251
00:27:02,013 --> 00:27:05,813
And obviously, don’t answer
the phone or the door.

252
00:27:05,984 --> 00:27:10,284
Of course you stay inside.
Keep it locked up.

253
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:14,247
Yes.

254
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:19,319
And no feeding those fish either.

255
00:27:19,497 --> 00:27:20,464
What?

256
00:27:21,332 --> 00:27:24,927
Listen. You’ve been kidnapped.

257
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,205
How can you feed the fish?

258
00:27:28,907 --> 00:27:31,842
But they’ll die, then.

259
00:27:33,845 --> 00:27:37,144
Who matters more, you or the fish?

260
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:45,813
I understand.

261
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,931
Next, the Hostage Life, 101.

262

00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:04,438
101?

263
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,307
First, no baths. Or showers.

264
00:28:08,446 --> 00:28:10,038
No showers?

265
00:28:10,215 --> 00:28:11,341
Of course not.

266
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,015
Not even my face?

267
00:28:17,088 --> 00:28:24,290
Listen, lady. If you want the story
to fly, you need actions, not just words.

268
00:28:25,396 --> 00:28:26,988
I`m sorry.

269
00:28:28,967 --> 00:28:35,270
Also, only eat the food l brought.

270
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:40,541
Don’t touch any of her food.

271
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:41,840
I understand.

272
00:28:43,214 --> 00:28:46,081
it’ll be rough, but that’s the deal.

273
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:49,320
Yes.

274
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:57,952
And there’s one more thing.

275
00:29:01,132 --> 00:29:07,332
While you were being held,
your hands and feet were tied.

276
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:09,173
Yes.

277
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,346
You have to tie me?

278
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:25,418
It’ll be more realistic if your
hands and feet are bruised.

279
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,559
Put on the others.

280
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:40,136
Yes.

281
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,180
I’m ready.

282
00:32:11,322 --> 00:32:15,224
I’ll get rid of these clothes.
All right?

283
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:17,528
Yes.

284
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:27,538
I’ll tie you up now.

285
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:21,182
You’ve got to bear it.

286
00:33:22,593 --> 00:33:23,525
Yes.

287
00:33:25,596 --> 00:33:27,530
You see how l did it?

288
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:30,468
I guess.

289
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:35,667
Undo it to go to the bathroom,
but tie yourself back up again.

290
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:38,703
I understand.

291
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,473
Your wrists, too.

292
00:34:06,804 --> 00:34:12,299
It doesn’t have to be so tight.
You want to be able to untie it.

293
00:34:13,444 --> 00:34:14,308
Yes.

294
00:34:17,882 --> 00:34:19,440
Try it.

295
00:35:06,464 --> 00:35:08,398
Pull this through here.

296
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:12,628
And tie it like this.

297
00:35:12,803 --> 00:35:13,770
Yes.

298
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:20,334
Pull it with your teeth.

299
00:36:01,752 --> 00:36:03,344
What are you doing?

300
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:07,920
You’re defenseless, aren’t you, lady?

301
00:36:08,025 --> 00:36:08,992
What?

302
00:36:11,028 --> 00:36:14,930
I always wanted to fuck someone tied up.

303
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,438
We’re not playing anymore.

304
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:24,900
Get it?

305
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:25,766
Please... don’t...

306
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:03,563
This is Shinko Enterprises.

307
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:09,602
Hello. This is Sato from Meiwa Bank.
We always appreciate your business.

308
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,443
Is the president in?

309
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:13,583
Please hold.

310
00:38:22,693 --> 00:38:25,821
Now this is what you call reality, lady.

311
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:56,850
I’ll call when l get back.

312
00:38:57,661 --> 00:39:00,789
But I can’t answer the phone.

313
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:06,831
I’ll ring 3 times, hang up, then
3 times again. You unlock the door.

314
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:08,996
I’ll  call when I’m close.

315
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,509
Three rings, and then
another three rings.

316
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,648
Lady.

317
00:42:18,128 --> 00:42:20,688
A mistake to answer the phone.

318
00:42:23,267 --> 00:42:24,199
Who is this?

319
00:42:24,835 --> 00:42:26,132
Who cares.

320
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:31,236
You? You did this?

321
00:42:31,942 --> 00:42:35,639
It’s your fault, Mr. Kidnapper.

322
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:38,042
Why’d you do it?

323
00:42:38,182 --> 00:42:39,877
It just happened.

324
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,918
That’s no reason.

325
00:42:42,252 --> 00:42:45,881
Look who’s talking.
You snatched her liberty.

326
00:42:46,056 --> 00:42:50,925
No. She asked me to stage a kidnapping.
That’s all.

327
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:55,161
You tied her up
to stage a kidnapping?

328
00:42:55,332 --> 00:42:58,665
It’s the truth.
She asked me to kidnap her.

329
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:05,104
Huh. I wonder if the cops will buy that.

330
00:43:08,212 --> 00:43:10,112
I need a favor.

331
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,217
What?

332
00:43:15,152 --> 00:43:17,279
Dump her for me.

333
00:43:17,454 --> 00:43:18,421
What?

334
00:43:18,856 --> 00:43:21,256
I don’t like loose ends.

335
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:24,122
Do it yourself.

336
00:43:24,395 --> 00:43:26,420
Don’t want to get caught.

337
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,359
Enough of your crap. Forget it.

338
00:43:32,803 --> 00:43:37,297
Oh, well. Then l have no choice.

339
00:43:40,978 --> 00:43:42,138
Meaning?

340
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:50,218
I’ll call the cops right now. Tell them
I heard a woman screaming in 303.

341
00:43:53,957 --> 00:43:55,117
What’s wrong?

342
00:44:06,036 --> 00:44:10,439
OK. I’ll do it.

343
00:44:12,242 --> 00:44:13,402
Thanks.

344
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:14,808
What?

345
00:44:14,912 --> 00:44:16,277
Take care of it.

346
00:46:21,004 --> 00:46:22,130
Noboru.

347
00:46:24,308 --> 00:46:25,605
Daddy.

348
00:46:26,043 --> 00:46:27,340
What’s wrong?

349
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:35,950
What happened?

350
00:46:38,422 --> 00:46:40,390
Had a fight?

351
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:48,122
OK. C’mon inside.

352
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,026
This is Ebara AII-serve.

353
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:27,033
I can’t take your call right now.

354
00:47:27,304 --> 00:47:29,295
Please leave your name

355
00:47:29,573 --> 00:47:34,169
and number after the tone
and I’ll call you back.

356
00:47:36,246 --> 00:47:38,544
Hello, it’s Misako...

357
00:47:40,284 --> 00:47:42,047
Hi, it’s me.

358
00:47:42,419 --> 00:47:47,152
What, you’re home.
Say, is Noboru with you?

359
00:47:47,557 --> 00:47:48,524
Yeah he is.

360
00:47:49,459 --> 00:47:51,359
Why can’t you call!

361
00:47:51,495 --> 00:47:52,462
What?

362
00:47:52,696 --> 00:47:56,132
I didn’t know where he’d gone,

363
00:47:56,199 --> 00:47:59,657
and was about to call the police.

364
00:48:00,304 --> 00:48:01,328
Sorry.

365
00:48:02,272 --> 00:48:07,073
Why are you always like this?
Can’t you think about others?

366
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:09,235
Noboru came by himself.

367
00:48:09,413 --> 00:48:11,711
But you could still call!

368
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,317
Sorry.

369
00:48:14,451 --> 00:48:16,282
I’ll come get him.

370
00:48:18,088 --> 00:48:20,352
No, I’ll bring him.

371
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:22,048
Leave now.

372
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:24,157
OK.

373
00:49:20,817 --> 00:49:22,478
Wait here, Noboru.

374
00:49:22,652 --> 00:49:24,051
Where you going?

375
00:49:31,161 --> 00:49:32,719
Where you going`!

376
00:49:33,363 --> 00:49:34,455
Move your car!

377
00:49:34,531 --> 00:49:35,589
Let go!

378
00:49:36,366 --> 00:49:39,267
Wait up! Asshole!

379
00:51:30,947 --> 00:51:32,244
Kept you waiting.

380
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,210
You look tired.

381
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:39,412
No.

382
00:51:40,457 --> 00:51:44,791
Why don’t you take a little
time off from work?

383
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:50,289
That’s not really possible.
Besides, I’d rather be working.

384
00:51:50,534 --> 00:51:51,523
I see.

385
00:51:51,668 --> 00:51:52,635
Please.
