1
00:00:00,494 --> 00:00:03,327
(Hard rock music)

2
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:14,168
(Loud crashing)

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,273
- [Narrator] It was the time of witches.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,819
Innocent women and men were sentenced

5
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:23,917
to death on the flimsiest of evidence.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,407
They were condemned by the jealousy,

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,707
avarice and ignorance of their neighbors.

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,927
The wretched ones that
were burned at the stake

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,417
died protesting their innocence.

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,117
Except one, Hepzibah Crowley,

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,213
the only real witch ever burned.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,367
Stories had circulated about Hepzibah

13
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,497
months before her trial.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,437
She had been seen
lending money to wild geese,

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,647
had performed weird
rituals with whipped cream,

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,387
and was rumored to have the ability

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,997
to converse with sardines.

18
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,367
The outraged townspeople brought her

19
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,917
before judge August loon.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,807
They presented their startling evidence,

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,513
including the testimony
of one woman who claimed

22
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:09,157
that Hepzibah had cursed her
to have two birthdays a year.

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,599
She told of the hardship
of writing thank you notes

24
00:01:11,682 --> 00:01:14,163
twice a year for birthday presents.

25
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,971
The judge saw great
force in their arguments

26
00:01:18,054 --> 00:01:22,597
and condemned Hepzibah to
be burned at the stake until dead,

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,953
and then turned over and
burned until dead on that side.

28
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,857
On the Eve of her
execution, judge loon himself

29
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,273
lit the flame to the kindling
surrounding the witch's feet.

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,374
As the flames leap up at
her, Hepzibah cried out...

31
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:41,257
(Flames crackling)

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,647
- [Hepzibah] Judge loon,
know thee by your actions

33
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,917
that upon this day the blackest of curses

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,277
will fall upon you and your male issue!

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,987
From this day forward, you
and all your male descendants

36
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,907
will live in fear of the day
when you will lose your senses.

37
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,807
You will never know
when the insanity will strike.

38
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,413
You will come to regret
the day you were born.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,607
You will be an embarrassment
to your family and community!

40
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,637
I gotta bring the curse to a close now

41
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,708
for I am nearly consumed by flames!

42
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:22,057
(Flames crackle)

43
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,890
- [Narrator] Judge loon laughed

44
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:25,597
as he really didn't believe in witches.

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,363
He just liked a good bonfire.

46
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,393
Witch Crowley was dead.

47
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:35,212
(Solemn harpsichord music)

48
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:42,967
In a matter of weeks, judge
loon began to act strangely.

49
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,007
One night, as his wife sat knitting,

50
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,837
judge loon jumped up from his chair

51
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,593
and started hailing taxis
for no apparent reason.

52
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:55,597
He began accusing their
cat of reading his mail.

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,278
And finally he insisted
on watching television

54
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,183
before it was invented.

55
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,347
He was put away in an
asylum for the rest of his life.

56
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,257
His sons followed him there in later years,

57
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,273
but not before marrying and
siring many sons of their own.

58
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,556
In spite of the coincidences,
the loon family refused

59
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,264
to believe they were victims of a curse.

60
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:22,037
And subsequently, the curse itself

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,370
was lost in family history.

62
00:03:25,753 --> 00:03:29,342
(Solemn harpsichord music)

63
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:33,092
(Somber instrumental music)

64
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,474
(Tense instrumental music)

65
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,691
(Suspenseful instrumental music)

66
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:25,465
(Equivocal instrumental music)

67
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:42,580
(Tense instrumental music)

68
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:57,387
(Cheerful instrumental music)

69
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,867
(Pan clangs)

70
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:31,036
(Cheerful music continues)

71
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:40,548
(Pleasant instrumental music)

72
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,284
(Birds chirping)

73
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:17,950
(Fingers tapping)

74
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:20,347
- He's late, he's always late.

75
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,357
- Well, what time's he supposed to be here?

76
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,037
- 20 minutes ago.

77
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,517
Say, I don't mind honoring
the boss on his birthday,

78
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,317
but I can't waste no time!

79
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,737
I got a 1:30 hit this afternoon, ya get me?

80
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,123
- Hey, no lines, boss loon here yet?

81
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:41,389
(Footsteps tapping)

82
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,967
Hey, Blackjack Connors!

83
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,027
I ain't seen you since that fort Knox job.

84
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,897
- Hi, Ozzie.

85
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,847
Hey, you know I still got
that gold bullion in the closet.

86
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,190
Nobody would fence it.

87
00:06:56,273 --> 00:07:00,079
- (Chuckles) Me too, everybody
wants to know where I got it.

88
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:01,657
Hey, I tried.

89
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,907
- Hey, it's been tough, you know.

90
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,207
It's like no one had ever
seen gold bullion before.

91
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,047
Hey, I even tried it in restaurants.

92
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,507
And they'd say to me, "don't
you got anything smaller?"

93
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,297
- Yeah, well, maybe someday.

94
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,123
Hey, this is socks Malone.

95
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,287
- Socks.

96
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,177
(Fingers snapping)

97
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,367
- Say, boss loon is here!

98
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,105
Bounce those lights.

99
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:28,053
(Footsteps tapping)

100
00:07:28,136 --> 00:07:29,917
(Boss loon shouts) (Gunshots popping)

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,207
- [Boss loon] You'll never take me alive!

102
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,208
Eat lead!

103
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,894
- Happy birthday! - Happy birthday, boss!

104
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:38,197
- Oh, what a surprise!

105
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,717
Blackjack, Ozzie, no lines.

106
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,853
How are ya?

107
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,733
Oh, say no more.

108
00:07:46,976 --> 00:07:50,100
Oh, what a beautiful cake.

109
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,763
Gentlemen, I am touched.

110
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,973
This is a great day for me.

111
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,493
Sit down, please.

112
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,153
I got something to tell yous.

113
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,047
This morning, I came up
with the best idea for a racket

114
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,603
that I've ever come up with.

115
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,447
This racket will make everything we do

116
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,457
look like nickels and dimes.

117
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,987
- We're all ears, boss.

118
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,637
- Yeah, we're always interested

119
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,497
in hearing a new proposition.

120
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,580
- This operation we're going
to start is musical comedy.

121
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,777
- Musical comedy?

122
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,407
- Sure, like we can rent an
old barn and set up chairs.

123
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,347
Socks, you can make popcorn and lemonade!

124
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,257
Like we can cast it with the
members of the flegel gang

125
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,177
and the purple gang and our gang.

126
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,202
Why, can't you just see it?

127
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:48,697
And we can get our parents
to come and our friends.

128
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,467
And why, there's lots of people

129
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,657
we can threaten who will show up.

130
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,167
And this morning I wrote
the best musical score

131
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,267
anybody's ever seen.

132
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,297
And even better, it's about people like us.

133
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,197
Listen to this.

134
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,167
I call it hoods and mauls.

135
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,787
Think of all the classy dames

136
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,647
we can have in skimpy little outfits.

137
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,597
My mom can sew the costumes.

138
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,577
And how about this number?

139
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,127
I call it, "I can duck the
law, but I can't duck love."

140
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,826
♪ I've been around this great big town ♪

141
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:27,778
♪ but no fears just like a clown ♪

142
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:29,658
♪ hear the little birds part ♪

143
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:33,658
♪ you put your handcuffs on me ♪

144
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,233
What do you think?

145
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:37,233
Great, huh?

146
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:43,057
- Can I be in it?

147
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,437
- Well, boss loon,

148
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,273
this is certainly an
unexpected proposition.

149
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,880
We'll talk it over and we'll let you know.

150
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:58,365
(Playful piano music)

151
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:08,019
(Tense orchestral music)

152
00:10:15,754 --> 00:10:17,130
- What a surprise.

153
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:19,327
It's so good to see you again.

154
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,547
- Oh, the neighborhood
hasn't changed much, has it?

155
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,717
- Well, I guess not,

156
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,997
but do you know who bought your old house?

157
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,867
Ron Emory.

158
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,767
- (Gasps) You're kidding.

159
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,867
Why, he was the news boy when I left.

160
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,517
- Well, time flies.

161
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,447
- How's Lonnie?

162
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,037
I haven't seen him since we played together

163
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,477
in the neighborhood.

164
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,497
- Why Lonnie, you
remember Althea Richardson?

165
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,957
She used to live on river run street.

166
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,787
Danny was always sweet on her.

167
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,077
- Oh, stop.

168
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,837
- Yes, I suppose I do.

169
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,207
- Well, what are you up to now?

170
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,287
- What am I up to?

171
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,997
Why do you ask me that?

172
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,263
- Well, it's been 12
years since I've seen you.

173
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,777
How is Danny anyway?

174
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,717
- Oh, he's all right, so far.

175
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,403
Got married, has two sons and a daughter.

176
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,897
I want to die!

177
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,967
- Oh, Lonnie not in front of company.

178
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,767
- The only way to end the curse!

179
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,927
- Oh, a curse.

180
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,367
- You think I'm insane?

181
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,877
You don't understand,
tonight the moon will be full.

182
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,347
Do you know what that means?

183
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,263
- High tide?

184
00:11:22,497 --> 00:11:26,340
- Tonight when the moon
is full, I'll turn into a wolf.

185
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,103
I'll kill.

186
00:11:29,493 --> 00:11:30,660
I'll want to kill.

187
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,567
I might even kill you.

188
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,457
- (Laughs) Don't be silly, Lonnie.

189
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,082
I could always tell when you were joking.

190
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,665
(Tense music)

191
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:46,632
(Quirky music)

192
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,397
Lonnie, stop it.

193
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,791
Stop writing on my hand!

194
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:51,817
- Oh, what's the use?

195
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,063
Lock me in my room, mother.

196
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,417
- Oh, now Lonnie, you
know that doesn't help.

197
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,931
Besides, I can't sleep
at night with you growling

198
00:11:58,014 --> 00:12:00,123
and throwing yourself against the door.

199
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:03,577
- I won't take responsibility
for what happens.

200
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,983
Do you understand?

201
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:10,364
- Poor Lonnie, he thinks he's a...

202
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:12,547
- Werewolf, that's right.

203
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,403
I think he just wants attention.

204
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:18,638
(Tense music continues)

205
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:24,894
(Suspenseful music)

206
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,477
(Lonnie growls)

207
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:47,274
(Lonnie growls)
(Suspenseful music continues)

208
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,517
- Well, Marge, it's been
nice seeing you again.

209
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,617
- [Marge] Well, I'll have to
come and see you someday.

210
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,732
- Oh, that'd be nice.

211
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:09,351
(Lonnie growls) (Althea screams)

212
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:11,370
(Lonnie groans)

213
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:14,620
That nut should be put away somewhere!

214
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:20,317
(Lonnie growls)

215
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,507
- It's only a couple of nights a month,

216
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:24,247
but it's such a nuisance.

217
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,867
I don't understand it.

218
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,803
His brother's such an angel.

219
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:32,314
(Quirky instrumental music)

220
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:40,932
(Phone rings)

221
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:42,364
- [Albert] Hello, check's.

222
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:43,739
Hold on.

223
00:14:43,822 --> 00:14:45,277
June for you.

224
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,777
- Hello.

225
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,610
Steve?

226
00:14:47,693 --> 00:14:48,912
Steve, who?

227
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:50,347
Oh, right.

228
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,287
Look, I'm real busy
now, I haven't got time.

229
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,847
Yeah, try to catch me later.

230
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,467
Goodbye.

231
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,597
The nerve of these insurance companies.

232
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,877
Hi, I'm Steve, remember me?

233
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,337
Try to pass themselves off
like they're your best friend.

234
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,567
- What are they pushing now?

235
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,714
- Oh, who knows.

236
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:07,807
Listen, be sure to save me table eight

237
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,887
for the day after tomorrow.

238
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,397
Jeff's coming home and
we're celebrating his birthday.

239
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,697
- Is he through with school yet?

240
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,530
- [June] Oh, yeah.

241
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,313
He's working in a lab down there now.

242
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:17,947
Sounded like he was gonna
spring something on me.

243
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,507
- Uh-oh. - I hope not.

244
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,973
I hate surprises.

245
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:24,115
Ah, there he is!

246
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:25,031
- Hi, mom.

247
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,538
Mom, this is, oh, there you are.

248
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:30,037
- I was saying hello to the cat outside.

249
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,047
- Oh, that must be the lindquists' cat.

250
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,369
- Mom, I want you to meet Kerry.

251
00:15:34,452 --> 00:15:37,597
- Hello, Mrs. Coukos.
- Hello, Kerry, Kerry what?

252
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,997
- Grant. - Kelly Grant, you're kidding?

253
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,624
You must hear no end to that.

254
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,172
- No end to what?

255
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:45,108
- Nevermind.

256
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:47,557
I guess you're the
surprise Jeff told me about.

257
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,237
- That's part of it.

258
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,512
The rest of it is Kerry
and I are getting married.

259
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:53,767
- Ah!

260
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:54,833
- What's the matter?

261
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,490
- I told you it was sudden!

262
00:15:56,573 --> 00:15:57,367
We should have warned her?

263
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,628
- Well, I thought she'd be happy.

264
00:15:58,711 --> 00:16:00,390
- Oh, I am, I am.

265
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,696
I just overreacted.

266
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:05,917
You're a charming girl, really.

267
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,623
And you, oh, you.

268
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,002
I could just kill you!

269
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:13,348
- What, ma!

270
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,697
- (Cries) I'm sorry!

271
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,587
I'm so sorry, I'm not a psychopath.

272
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,667
Really, I'm not.

273
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,937
It's just that I'm very
upset about this news!

274
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,770
Oh god!

275
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:24,388
- Let's go have some
coffee and talk this over.

276
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:27,064
(June cries)

277
00:16:27,147 --> 00:16:30,367
- So it was kind of fast, I guess.

278
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,187
- What did Jeff tell you about his family?

279
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,187
- Just about you and that
his father had passed away.

280
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,720
- I see.

281
00:16:37,803 --> 00:16:39,937
But why didn't you tell me about all this?

282
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,497
I don't live that far away, do I?

283
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,458
You're only in the next state.

284
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,334
- I know, I know, but, well,

285
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:47,767
I was afraid if I told you
it would somehow jinx it.

286
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,497
You know what a bad time
I had at home dating wise.

287
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,413
- Yes.

288
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,057
Hi, is this Sherry?

289
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,147
Hello, this is Jeff's mother, Jeff coukos.

290
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,227
That's right.

291
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,147
I wanted to tell you
how grateful I am to you

292
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,487
for letting him take you out this Saturday.

293
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,897
I want you to know that his disease

294
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,507
isn't nearly as contagious
as everyone thinks.

295
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,169
So you'll probably be perfectly safe

296
00:17:09,252 --> 00:17:10,833
as long as you don't touch him.

297
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,833
Kerry, you like cats, don't you?

298
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,641
- Yes.

299
00:17:25,724 --> 00:17:27,997
- I see four or five of
them out in the yard.

300
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,945
Why don't you go say hello to them?

301
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:31,628
- All right, you can talk alone.

302
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,124
(Quirky music)

303
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:46,465
(Lips smacking)

304
00:17:48,406 --> 00:17:50,377
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

305
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,757
- You cannot marry her.

306
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,701
- What the hell is this all about?

307
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:55,384
- Oh, I give up.

308
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:56,300
I give up.

309
00:17:58,088 --> 00:18:00,243
Ah, it all had to come out sooner or later.

310
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,877
Sit down, I've got something to tell you.

311
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,313
This is gonna be a shock.

312
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,802
- Yours?

313
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:23,017
- Yeah, she's always getting away.

314
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,406
I've sentenced her to a life indoors.

315
00:18:25,489 --> 00:18:26,737
- Huh?

316
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,147
- Yes, it's a private joke.

317
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,475
I'm the judge in this county.

318
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:31,904
- Oh, right, I get it. (Laughs)

319
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:34,237
- Oh, are you a friend of the Coukos's?

320
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,437
- Well, one of them anyway.

321
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,757
I'm Jeff's fiancee.

322
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,467
- Oh, congratulations.

323
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,627
I didn't realize he was even home.

324
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,967
I haven't seen Jeff in some time.

325
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,257
I live next door.

326
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,897
- His mother is different.

327
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,067
You wouldn't know her from
a sanity hearing, would you?

328
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,297
- June's a wonderful woman.

329
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,948
She runs the restaurant in town, check's.

330
00:18:55,031 --> 00:18:56,117
Why do you say that?

331
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,310
- Well, she certainly
has a problem with me.

332
00:18:59,393 --> 00:19:01,687
- Well, Jeff and she have had a hard time.

333
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,892
Husband's dead.

334
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,464
And then the other...

335
00:19:04,547 --> 00:19:05,297
- Other what?

336
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,977
- Oh, oh, just other
things, I shouldn't say.

337
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,253
I've gotta go, nice meeting you.

338
00:19:12,628 --> 00:19:14,973
- Boy, I'm sure popular today.

339
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,227
- [June] You have a brother.

340
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,247
- What?

341
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,397
- [June] You have a
brother, an older brother.

342
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,927
I never told you about him because of...

343
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,760
- Well, who?

344
00:19:23,843 --> 00:19:25,927
I mean, where is he, dead?

345
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,307
- No, he's not dead.

346
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,700
He's still alive.

347
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,727
I think it's time you met him.

348
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,860
That'll explain things better than I can.

349
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,810
Can you get rid of Kerry for a while?

350
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,753
Oh god.

351
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,487
- Hello, Mrs. Coukos.

352
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,837
Glad to see you again.

353
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,757
- I had to see Jasper this afternoon.

354
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,617
- Who's Jasper? - He's your brother.

355
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,227
Dr. Fiasco, this is Jeff, my other son.

356
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,510
I just told him about
Jasper this afternoon.

357
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,897
- Your brother is the most interesting case

358
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,307
in my experience.

359
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,527
He is subject to... (Person screams)

360
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,533
Put that down right now!

361
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,557
He's been subject to many strange delusions

362
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,040
all the time he's been here.

363
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,398
That's Jasper right there.

364
00:20:20,481 --> 00:20:21,937
- [Jeff] He looks okay.

365
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,637
- [Dr. Fiasco] He believes
himself to be a marionette.

366
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,917
- [Jeff] A marionette, a string puppet?

367
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,177
- [Dr. Fiasco] Correct.

368
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,827
It's very interesting.

369
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,257
His movements, his voice.

370
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,362
He gets very upset if
you tangle his strings.

371
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:36,607
- [Jeff] Ma, what is this?

372
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,397
- [June] Shut up, just watch.

373
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,147
(Fists banging)

374
00:20:45,485 --> 00:20:46,235
(Fists banging)

375
00:20:46,318 --> 00:20:47,287
- [Dr. Fiasco] Hello, Jasper.

376
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,483
You have visitors.

377
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,793
- Oh, well, what a happy day for me.

378
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,657
Hello, mother.

379
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,217
And who is this young man with you?

380
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,747
- [June] This is Jeff.

381
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,467
- Well, hello, Jeff.

382
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,443
- Hello.

383
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,707
- Hey, hey, hey, cut it out.

384
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,184
Hey, hey, you caught my string.

385
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,253
- I am not! - Please don't struggle.

386
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:10,653
I'll undo it.

387
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,507
- Jasper, I have a surprise for you.

388
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,517
Jeff is your younger brother.

389
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,677
- Oh, what a wonderful surprise.

390
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,137
I didn't know I had a brother.

391
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,443
Another chip off the old block, aye?

392
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,467
- I'm sorry to have
done it like that, honey.

393
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,877
But I had to show you,

394
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,887
or you wouldn't have believed me otherwise.

395
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,377
- So I've had a brother
in a mental hospital

396
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,210
all these years and didn't know it?

397
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,667
I mean, he must have went off the deep end

398
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,953
before I was born.

399
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,717
He can't be that much older than me.

400
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,697
I mean, do people go crazy that young?

401
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,877
- He was born insane.

402
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,291
- A crazy baby?

403
00:21:53,374 --> 00:21:54,667
No, that can't be.

404
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,407
- I wouldn't have thought so either.

405
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,107
But it was only a few months
before he started to show it.

406
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,247
- Like what?

407
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,957
- Oh, little things at first.

408
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,457
Crawling backwards.

409
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,197
Instead of crying, he'd sing.

410
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,997
At least it sounded like a song.

411
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,007
I think it was heartbreak hotel.

412
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,147
And then it got worse.

413
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,857
He kept trying to borrow the car,

414
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,498
and he wanted aluminum
siding on his bassinet.

415
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:15,331
- [Jeff] He could talk in a few months?

416
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:17,715
- Oh, I told you he wasn't normal.

417
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:19,627
He climbed up into the bookcase one day

418
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,837
and said he was volume 12
of the encyclopedia Britannica.

419
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,943
Here's his picture.

420
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,780
- Isn't he wearing a...

421
00:22:27,863 --> 00:22:31,297
- Yes, a little straight
jacket with pandas on it.

422
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,577
I can still see him sleeping
in his little padded crib.

423
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,827
- So you had him put away?

424
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,147
- It was all we could do.

425
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,277
Your father was afraid
to have another child.

426
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,167
I said it was just a freak thing.

427
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,842
Then we had you.

428
00:22:42,925 --> 00:22:45,847
Then we found out about the curse.

429
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,436
- My god, there's a curse?

430
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:51,519
(Suspenseful music)

431
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,267
- Where did you get this diary?

432
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,727
- It was in my grandmother's
trunk in a strong box.

433
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,407
I never knew a thing
about it until after she died

434
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,147
and we cleaned her house out.

435
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,887
I didn't believe it at first, of course.

436
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:05,517
And I never told Jeff about
something that sounded so crazy.

437
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,597
My grandmother was as solid as a rock

438
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,729
until the day she died.

439
00:23:08,812 --> 00:23:10,957
And this is definitely her handwriting.

440
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,264
She says that's judge
loon's diary then I believe it.

441
00:23:13,347 --> 00:23:15,030
- And you buy this stuff about the curse?

442
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:16,477
- Look at all that other stuff.

443
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,427
The letters and the newspapers.

444
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,467
I had a genealogist trace
our family history back

445
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,727
from the 1600s.

446
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,887
All of the men went insane eventually,

447
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,659
sometime after their 20th birthday.

448
00:23:25,742 --> 00:23:27,667
Some of them made it into their 50s,

449
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,007
but not one died a sane man.

450
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,840
- And no effect on the women.

451
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:32,917
- The women are the carriers.

452
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,467
The loon name died out because
eventually all the men died

453
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,297
before having more male children.

454
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,387
But the loon daughters
lived on and had sons.

455
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,787
The last name changed, of
course, 'cause of the marriages.

456
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:45,367
But it's still the same loon blood.

457
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,247
Well, look at Jasper,
the man's a marionette.

458
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,717
What more proof do you need?

459
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,277
- You really expect me to believe something

460
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,687
out of Nathaniel Hawthorne?

461
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,307
- All right, fine, don't believe me.

462
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,567
I've done all I could.

463
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:57,487
- I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend you.

464
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,487
It's just, you know, witch's
curses in the 20th century?

465
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,287
- I understand.

466
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,367
Well, if you'll excuse me now,

467
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,757
I have to go churn some butter.

468
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,017
- Oh, oh, wait a minute, ma.

469
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,117
Hold it right there.

470
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,657
It was you, wasn't it?

471
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,757
All through high school,
I never had any dates.

472
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,617
You sabotaged them!

473
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,697
Whenever I did make a date,

474
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,467
well, the girl would mysteriously cancel.

475
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,300
- Oh, I admit it.

476
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:19,133
I'm sorry, honey.

477
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:20,557
I had to keep you from
getting involved with women.

478
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,897
- And now I understand
why you kept suggesting

479
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,407
I join the priesthood, and
we weren't even Catholics!

480
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,434
- Well, try to understand.

481
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:28,387
I had to do these things.

482
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,307
You're the last male in the entire family.

483
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,037
If you had children, the
curse would go on and on.

484
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,867
I mean, think of the anguish your children

485
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,847
would suffer the day that
their daddy started thinking

486
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:37,927
he was a lawn sprinkler.

487
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,147
- I see what you were trying to do.

488
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,770
And I understand it was for my own good.

489
00:24:42,853 --> 00:24:44,970
And I hate your guts!

490
00:24:45,053 --> 00:24:47,503
(June screams)

491
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,175
- Stop it, you two!

492
00:24:49,258 --> 00:24:51,457
I think you're both crazy, and I'm leaving!

493
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,747
- Wait, Kerry, wait!

494
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,053
Look, see, we're all right.

495
00:24:56,136 --> 00:24:57,757
- I wanna meet Jasper.

496
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,974
- What good will that do?

497
00:24:59,057 --> 00:25:00,989
- Well, maybe if I see him it'll...

498
00:25:01,072 --> 00:25:04,290
I don't know, but at least
I'd be doing something!

499
00:25:04,373 --> 00:25:06,307
- I think it's a good idea.

500
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,007
I mean, if she met Jasper,
then she's sure to believe me.

501
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,717
And then you could go find another man

502
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,570
and forget about Jeff.

503
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:14,047
- Good old, ma.

504
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,207
Always thinking of me, huh?

505
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,677
Well, let's get some rest.

506
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,927
We can go to the asylum tomorrow.

507
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,164
But I tell you, it's like
visiting Pinocchio. (Laughs)

508
00:25:24,247 --> 00:25:26,830
(Quirky music)

509
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:30,150
(Mouth blows)

510
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:32,650
(Hands clap)

511
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,259
- My, my, my, what a wonderful surprise.

512
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:39,037
I'm the happiest puppet on earth.

513
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,057
Tell me, mother.

514
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,907
How long ago was it
when I was first carved?

515
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,917
- Well, you're 30 years old today, Jasper.

516
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,827
- My, my, that much time has passed, aye?

517
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:49,207
Where does it all go?

518
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,827
- Well, life's pretty crazy.

519
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,101
- Maybe someday, Jeff,
if I'm a real good boy,

520
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:56,347
I'll become a human
being just like you did.

521
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,263
- I've always been a human being.

522
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:02,131
- Well, Jasper, we have to
be getting back home now.

523
00:26:02,214 --> 00:26:04,133
Happy birthday, honey.

524
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:07,053
Oh dear, you got another
big knot in your string.

525
00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:10,357
There. - Oh, thank you, mother.

526
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,190
- Goodbye, honey.

527
00:26:11,273 --> 00:26:12,410
We'll see you again soon.

528
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,483
- Bye.

529
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,100
It's nice to see you again.

530
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,583
Don't tell any lies.

531
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,960
- I'll be with you in a minute.

532
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,397
Jasper, do you like it here?

533
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,103
- Oh, yes, it's very pleasant.

534
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,247
- Did your mother ever tell
you about a curse on the family?

535
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,897
- A curse, no.

536
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,487
I don't know anything about a curse.

537
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,317
Who'd wanna put a curse on me?

538
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,263
I'm just a happy marionette.

539
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:44,167
- You really are, aren't you?

540
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,077
- Someday I hope to
live my life without strings.

541
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,199
- Yeah, well, wouldn't we all.

542
00:26:50,282 --> 00:26:54,003
Well, it was nice to meet you.

543
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:56,723
Hang in there.

544
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,783
(Shoes clacking)

545
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,766
- Hang in there, what a nice expression.

546
00:27:04,849 --> 00:27:07,432
(Quirky music)

547
00:27:12,387 --> 00:27:15,220
(Car engine hums)

548
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,097
- Jasper seemed like a very nice puppet.

549
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,013
Man.

550
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,957
So what do you wanna do tonight?

551
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,867
- Look out, Jeff!

552
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,272
(Tires screech)

553
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:36,060
(Car horn honks)

554
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:37,683
- What are you crazy, buddy?

555
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,247
- Time to eat your cake, Jasper.

556
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,510
- That's right, nurse.

557
00:27:46,593 --> 00:27:49,417
Wasn't it nice to find out
you had a brother, Jasper?

558
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,288
- It was one of the top thrills of my life.

559
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,121
Well, now let me see.

560
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:58,286
(Foreboding music)

561
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,845
Gee, why does I feel strange?

562
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,777
- What is it, Jasper?

563
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,110
- Quiet, maybe another change is coming.

564
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:08,393
He hasn't changed in 15 years.

565
00:28:09,163 --> 00:28:11,182
- Hey, hey, you.

566
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:12,715
Hey, put those scissors down.

567
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:15,097
No, he's cutting my strings.

568
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,553
No, my hand.

569
00:28:16,636 --> 00:28:18,367
No, hey, take it easy.

570
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,867
Hey, give me a break, hey.

571
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,577
No, hey.

572
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,657
No, not my head string.

573
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,573
No, not that!

574
00:28:34,998 --> 00:28:38,498
(Tense harpsichord music)

575
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:41,587
- Where are the woods on this map?

576
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,077
- Oh, that's a forest where this witch

577
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,417
was supposedly buried in an unmarked grave.

578
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,737
- Is it somewhere around here?

579
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,257
- Some rich guy owned
a lot of land back then.

580
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,177
Now it's become part of
some conservation land

581
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,413
in northbridge.

582
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:55,237
- Are we near northbridge?

583
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,703
- A couple towns over.

584
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,070
- Where's this forest?

585
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:01,747
- So you're gonna look for her grave now?

586
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,803
You didn't believe me yesterday.

587
00:29:03,886 --> 00:29:06,053
Oh, no, I was a pencil head yesterday.

588
00:29:06,136 --> 00:29:08,373
- Oh, right, I'm sorry.

589
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,157
You know, after seeing
all of this documentation

590
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,322
and meeting Jasper,
I'm beginning to wonder.

591
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:16,387
- Oh, come on, Kerry.

592
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,220
Not you too.

593
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:21,037
So I've got a brother who
went insane at an early age.

594
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,383
That's not unique.

595
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,087
I don't buy this diary business either.

596
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,937
I think grandma coukos was off her rocker.

597
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,087
- How can you discount all
this proof I've shown you?

598
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,187
- Look, I'm a hematologist.

599
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,957
I know all about blood.

600
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,228
You don't carry insanity
around in your blood.

601
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:40,811
(Phone rings)

602
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,277
Hello, this is Jeff coukos.

603
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,683
Oh, hello, Dr. Fiasco.

604
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,953
What?

605
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,783
What?

606
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,317
You're kidding, I mean,
we just came from there.

607
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,150
- What is it?

608
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:58,450
What's the matter with Jasper?

609
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:01,180
- [Jeff] All right, doctor,
we'll be down right now.

610
00:30:01,263 --> 00:30:02,613
Goodbye.

611
00:30:02,696 --> 00:30:03,778
- What?

612
00:30:03,861 --> 00:30:04,778
What, what?

613
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,597
What?

614
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,677
- Jasper has gone sane.

615
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,027
He's found his mind.

616
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,097
- What, how can that be?

617
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,777
- Oh, let's go see him.

618
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,187
I don't believe this.

619
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,193
- Yeah, sure.

620
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,037
- You go ahead.

621
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,207
I wanna find this forest.

622
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,890
There's something going on here.

623
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:26,173
I was wrong.

624
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:27,937
There's something going on with this deal.

625
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,909
If I could find Hepzibah's grave.

626
00:30:29,992 --> 00:30:32,909
(Flames crackling)

627
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:38,306
(Match strikes)

628
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:41,797
(Mouth blows)

629
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,027
- No, Jasper.

630
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,917
There's no tobacco in the pipe.

631
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,310
Now you can hold it,
but you can't smoke it.

632
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:48,071
- That's all right, nurse.

633
00:30:48,154 --> 00:30:50,680
I don't care about the tobacco.

634
00:30:50,763 --> 00:30:53,137
Fire fascinates me for some reason.

635
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,466
I wonder why.

636
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:56,887
- It's amazing, Mrs. Coukos.

637
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,017
He seems to be completely recovered.

638
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,147
One minute he was celebrating his birthday,

639
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,277
and the next minute he became agitated.

640
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,917
And then his mind seemed
to be clear and cognizant.

641
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,777
- God, what do I say to him?

642
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,207
I'm not used to his being rational.

643
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:11,497
Did he take up smoking?

644
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,927
- [Dr. Fiasco] No, he asked to have a pipe.

645
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,087
He just likes to hold it for some reason.

646
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,307
I saw no reason to deprive him of it.

647
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,707
It makes him feel like an adult.

648
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,693
- Let me try him.

649
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,137
Hello, Jasper, remember me?

650
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,207
I'm your younger brother, Jeff.

651
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,457
- Jeff, my long lost brother.

652
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,197
I'm your older brother, Jasper.

653
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,397
I'm completely sane now.

654
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,807
I'm very glad to see you again.

655
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:39,153
Don't you think I'm sane?

656
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,973
- Well, yes.

657
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,933
- Hello, mother.

658
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,173
- Oh, my poor crazy little baby!

659
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:54,937
(Bodies thud)

660
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,080
- Is this customary, I...

661
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,937
- You don't hold it against
me for putting you in here,

662
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,770
do you, honey?

663
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,020
- No, of course I don't.

664
00:32:03,103 --> 00:32:04,147
I don't blame you at all.

665
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,007
It was very sane of you.

666
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,237
And now I'm sane, and
you're sane, and you're sane.

667
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,895
And I'm sane, you're sane, and you're sane.

668
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:14,527
(Head bangs)

669
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,627
- Sometimes he gets stuck.

670
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,697
- Doesn't think he's a vending
machine now, does he?

671
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,188
- No, he just hasn't had time
to develop like everyone else.

672
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:24,727
His recovery was instantaneous.

673
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,382
It's been a shock to his system.

674
00:32:26,465 --> 00:32:29,137
The whole thing is really uncanny.

675
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,053
- And I'm sane.

676
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:34,081
(Birds chirping)

677
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:45,757
(Distant banging)

678
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,007
(Wind howling softly)

679
00:32:51,064 --> 00:32:53,647
(Wind howling)

680
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,823
(Shovel thuds)

681
00:33:07,033 --> 00:33:09,616
(Witch laughs)

682
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:14,500
(Kerry screams) (Ground cracks)

683
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:17,085
(Witch laughs)

684
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:20,668
(Eerie harpsichord music)

685
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,897
- Listen, I don't need a wheelchair.

686
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,637
- Hospital policy.

687
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,337
- Doctor, do you think
he may have a relapse?

688
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,077
I mean, you're releasing
him awfully quickly.

689
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,081
- I know, but we need the bed space.

690
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:40,627
He'll still be under observation
on an outpatient basis.

691
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,557
But I wouldn't worry.

692
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,477
He appears to be just fine.

693
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,760
I wish I could take
credit for his recovery.

694
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,170
- I'll get the car.

695
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,307
- [Dr. Fiasco] You're going to have to be

696
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,017
very patient with Jasper.

697
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,967
You'll find his attitude and perceptions

698
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,647
very much as a child.

699
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,717
But he'll have to grow up to survive.

700
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,387
Superficially, he appears to be an adult,

701
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,577
but he's naive and
doesn't understand things

702
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,197
we take for granted.

703
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,467
He should develop a more
adult persona in a short time.

704
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,677
He's very intelligent, actually.

705
00:34:12,704 --> 00:34:16,287
(Somber harpsichord music)

706
00:34:24,038 --> 00:34:29,038
(Shovel thumps) (Jarring organ music)

707
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:35,058
(Soil thuds)

708
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:40,904
(Shovel thumps) (Jarring organ music)

709
00:34:55,979 --> 00:34:58,240
(Lightning zaps)

710
00:34:58,323 --> 00:35:01,073
(Ground rumbles)

711
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:04,917
(Plaque whooshes)

712
00:35:06,903 --> 00:35:10,070
(Jarring organ music)

713
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:13,731
- You see, Jasper, it's really difficult

714
00:35:13,814 --> 00:35:15,817
to explain to you what's happened.

715
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,007
- Well, I believe you
about the witch's curse.

716
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,527
I read all about witches
in this gripping novel

717
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,357
called "snow white."

718
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,277
And I'll never, ever eat
apples again after that.

719
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,537
It was quite a revelation.

720
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,764
- Well, you got a head start on Jeff.

721
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:28,459
He doesn't believe any of this.

722
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,704
But anyway, do you understand?

723
00:35:30,787 --> 00:35:34,027
We put you in the hospital
because you were insane.

724
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:37,333
And now on your birthday,
you've gone normal.

725
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:38,981
- The thing that I don't
understand, mother,

726
00:35:39,064 --> 00:35:41,977
is why did the curse work backwards on me?

727
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,350
- Jasper, there is no curse.

728
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,517
I mean, don't listen to ma.

729
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,187
I mean, you're supposed to be sane now.

730
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,197
Don't tell me you believe
in storybook witches.

731
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,337
- Oh, yes, I do.

732
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,567
Mother wouldn't lie.

733
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,277
- Of course not, don't listen to Jeff.

734
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,107
He has no imagination.

735
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,083
And one other thing, stop that!

736
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:03,281
(Wheelchair clangs)

737
00:36:03,364 --> 00:36:06,531
(Jarring organ music)

738
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,070
- Come inside, I've gotta
show you something.

739
00:36:12,745 --> 00:36:13,714
(Lips smacking) - Where have you been?

740
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,057
- I've been in the
woods, I found something.

741
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,997
- Ah, Kerry, Jasper's home.

742
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,847
Jasper, you remember Kerry, Jeff's fiancee?

743
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,285
- Kerry!

744
00:36:23,368 --> 00:36:25,267
(Kerry shouts)

745
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,364
- Are you okay? - What's that all about?

746
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:28,177
- I just, it's so nice to see her again.

747
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,243
- You mustn't knock people over.

748
00:36:31,452 --> 00:36:34,477
You all right? - Look, look, look.

749
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,310
- Where did you find this?

750
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,747
- In the woods where
she's supposed to be buried.

751
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,174
Her ghost showed me.
- Her ghost showed you.

752
00:36:40,257 --> 00:36:41,677
- I believe in ghosts.

753
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,087
- I bet you do.

754
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:48,157
- They come out on Halloween,
and they look like this.

755
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,297
Only they have two black holes right here.

756
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,073
And they go, whoo, whoo, whoo!

757
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,077
- Gotta take us there,
Jeff's gotta believe this now.

758
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,247
- Oh, come off it.

759
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,247
Some kids knew about the
legend and put it there for a joke.

760
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:08,587
- I didn't imagine a hand grabbing my leg.

761
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,634
- What? - A ghost grabbed my leg.

762
00:37:10,717 --> 00:37:11,587
(Kerry shouts) - Jasper!

763
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,420
- Scared you, didn't I?

764
00:37:12,503 --> 00:37:13,747
Will you give me some candy now?

765
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,887
- Jasper, go stand in the corner.

766
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,353
We grownups have to talk.

767
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,051
- They let him out?

768
00:37:19,134 --> 00:37:21,007
Couldn't you put him in a daycare center?

769
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,417
- It's only temporary.

770
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,647
I hope.

771
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,837
Jeff, are you coming? - Yes, yes.

772
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,143
Anything to put an end to this nonsense.

773
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,167
- [June] Jasper, mommy's
going out for a while.

774
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,487
Stay in the house.

775
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,943
Don't let any strangers in, understand?

776
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
- This is where the hand grabbed me, ah!

777
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:48,307
- Do you, either of you, (Branch snaps)

778
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:53,010
Expect me to believe that
pure evil exists in the world?

779
00:37:53,093 --> 00:37:55,760
(Ominous music)

780
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,317
- Hi, I'm Steve weevil

781
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,507
from the shakee mutual
trust insurance company.

782
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,007
Is Mrs. Coukos home?

783
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,377
- No. - Oh, that's too bad.

784
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,567
I told her I might be stopping in today.

785
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:14,729
- Are you a stranger?

786
00:38:14,812 --> 00:38:17,197
- Well, I'm no stranger than Mrs. Coukos.

787
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,087
- Well, I'm not supposed
to let in strangers,

788
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,547
but if you're not a stranger,
you can come in and wait.

789
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,417
- Well, I suppose I can
give her a few minutes.

790
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,397
I'd really hate to miss her.

791
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,137
- Okay, why don't you wait in the kitchen?

792
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,517
She just vacuumed in here.

793
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,350
- Oh, of course.

794
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:33,577
I wouldn't want to get her mad.

795
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,270
- Where are you from?

796
00:38:35,353 --> 00:38:36,813
- Shakee mutual trust.

797
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,027
- What a strange sounding name.

798
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,857
Is it in this state?

799
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,037
- No, I work for shakee mutual trust.

800
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,653
I'm an insurance agent.

801
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:51,367
Look, maybe I better get going.

802
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,653
- What's insurance?

803
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,583
- Come on.

804
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,667
You're kidding me, right?

805
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,167
You don't know what insurance is?

806
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,257
- No, I've been in a hospital
ever since I was born.

807
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,017
I'm out now, I'm perfectly
sane now, don't you think so?

808
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,387
- Think what? - That I'm sane.

809
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,753
- Well, yeah, sure.

810
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,287
But a really sane person
would have insurance.

811
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:16,507
- Oh, I don't have any insurance.

812
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,467
- You don't?

813
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,297
We can fix that right
here and now if you'd like.

814
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,137
Would you like that?

815
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,697
- Well, if it's the sane thing to do,

816
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,530
I should do it.

817
00:39:22,613 --> 00:39:23,917
- It is the sane thing to do.

818
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,750
It's very sane.

819
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:27,877
Such as this life
insurance policy right here.

820
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,247
Now, if you don't understand anything,

821
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:33,127
you have any questions, feel free to ask.

822
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,377
I have all the answers for you.

823
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,023
- What's insurance mean?

824
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,603
- Insurance.

825
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,310
We insure your life

826
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,567
for a small monthly
payment that you can easily...

827
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,429
Insurance, we make certain that...

828
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,567
- you mean if I buy one of
your life insurance policies,

829
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,886
I'll live forever?

830
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:55,162
- No, no, no.

831
00:39:55,245 --> 00:39:56,857
That's not it at all.

832
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,367
You see, the insurance
policy provides your family

833
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,850
with a substantial amount
of money when you die.

834
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,573
- I'm going to die?

835
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,793
- Well, of course.

836
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,557
- When?

837
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,177
- [Steve] I don't know when.

838
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,787
- Don't toy with me, Steve, you know.

839
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,040
- I tell you, I really don't know.

840
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,477
- But you said you had all the answers.

841
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,697
- I can't answer that question.

842
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,627
Why don't you just trust me?

843
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,567
You know at shakee our slogan

844
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,207
is "your life is in our hands."

845
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,157
Well, at least we'd like to think so.

846
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,407
Now, for an intelligent,
perceptive person like you,

847
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,997
you deserve the royal treatment.

848
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,937
Yes, the superfluous life guarantee.

849
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,541
This policy will guarantee you
against any conceivable thing

850
00:40:39,624 --> 00:40:41,137
that could happen to you and many,

851
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,267
many more that will
never, ever happen to you.

852
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:46,117
And the premium, oh, it's so reasonable.

853
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,937
Here's the sum of what
you'll pay every month.

854
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,497
- Oh, that was too
fast, can I see it again?

855
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,117
- Sure.

856
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,067
- I almost saw it that
time, just one more chance.

857
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,350
- Okay, one more chance.

858
00:40:56,376 --> 00:40:57,787
- Oh! - That's it, I'm sorry.

859
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,717
That was your last chance.

860
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,993
Now, please sign on the dotted line.

861
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,757
- And coukos.

862
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,427
- Thank you very much, Mr. Coukos.

863
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,367
- Jasper. - Hmm, quaint name.

864
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,827
Well, here's my card.

865
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,685
If you have any questions,
please call me at the office.

866
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:19,648
I'll be glad to help you in any way I can.

867
00:41:19,731 --> 00:41:20,763
Bye now.

868
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,003
- This could prove very valuable.

869
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,127
- Big deal.

870
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:30,097
So there's a hole in the ground
where you found a plaque.

871
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,297
What now?

872
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,563
You're gonna look for a
corpse that's not there?

873
00:41:33,646 --> 00:41:35,621
- It is there, it must be.

874
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:38,197
Or do you think I'm crazy too?

875
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,602
- You were just carried away with the idea.

876
00:41:40,685 --> 00:41:42,847
My mother's crazy.

877
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,617
- Oh, thanks a lot.

878
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,450
My son.

879
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:47,767
You know, I think Jasper
made more sense when he was

880
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,687
in the asylum than you do now.

881
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,307
Have you thought of this wise guy?

882
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,627
Tomorrow's your birthday.

883
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,460
- Well, so?

884
00:41:53,543 --> 00:41:54,714
- [Kerry] Well, doesn't
it worry you a little?

885
00:41:54,797 --> 00:41:56,047
- No, it doesn't.

886
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,757
And it shouldn't you either.

887
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,967
And don't go out buying me a
monogrammed straight jacket.

888
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:04,327
If I do end up in one, it
will be because of you two.

889
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,293
And not because of some goddamned curse!

890
00:42:09,752 --> 00:42:13,117
- [Together] Happy birthday, Jeff!

891
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,820
- Well, ma, this is really touching.

892
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:19,027
Throwing my birthday
party at your restaurant.

893
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,977
And you know what would make it even nicer?

894
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,357
- [June] What?

895
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,157
- If you'd sit at the same table with me.

896
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,624
- Well, we'd love to,
hun, but how do you feel?

897
00:42:28,707 --> 00:42:31,416
- Very, very sane.

898
00:42:31,499 --> 00:42:32,316
- What did you expect, mother?

899
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:33,149
I mean, after all,

900
00:42:33,232 --> 00:42:35,970
we're a sane bunch of people, aren't we?

901
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,327
- Come on, this is silly.

902
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:38,613
Let's go sit with him.

903
00:42:41,146 --> 00:42:43,896
(Shoes clacking)

904
00:42:47,452 --> 00:42:49,057
- [Hepzibah] From this day forward,

905
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,657
you and all your male
descendants will live in fear

906
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,743
of the day when you will lose your senses!

907
00:42:57,652 --> 00:43:00,247
(Hepzibah laughs)

908
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:02,651
- What's the matter, Jeff?

909
00:43:02,734 --> 00:43:04,719
- Jasper, where'd you get that nose?

910
00:43:04,802 --> 00:43:06,552
- You mean this nose?

911
00:43:07,564 --> 00:43:09,095
(Nose squeaks)

912
00:43:09,178 --> 00:43:10,103
- What's the matter, Jeff?

913
00:43:10,186 --> 00:43:12,031
- Nothing, nothing.

914
00:43:12,114 --> 00:43:14,257
Let's just cut the cake.

915
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,927
- Albert, would you bring
the cake cutter, please?

916
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,387
- Hey, where'd the balloons come from?

917
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:20,527
- Happy birthday, Jeff.

918
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,210
It's good to see you again.

919
00:43:22,293 --> 00:43:23,940
- Thanks, Albert.

920
00:43:24,023 --> 00:43:27,364
Albert, is that a new hairstyle?

921
00:43:27,447 --> 00:43:28,240
- Why, yes, it is.

922
00:43:28,323 --> 00:43:29,737
It's a bozo punk.

923
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,178
How do you like it?

924
00:43:31,261 --> 00:43:32,887
(Playful carnival music)

925
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:35,287
- Ma, is this some kind of joke?

926
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,233
- Jeff, what's wrong with you?

927
00:43:37,316 --> 00:43:38,197
- No.

928
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,753
No, this can't be happening.

929
00:43:41,735 --> 00:43:43,516
- [Kerry] What's the matter, Jeff?

930
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:44,974
- Nothing.

931
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:46,974
I guess I'm just tired.

932
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:51,714
- Whoa, Nelly, Jeff-e-roo!

933
00:43:51,797 --> 00:43:54,727
What's the matter with you? (Laughs)

934
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,612
- You look like you've see a ghost.

935
00:43:56,695 --> 00:43:59,917
(Both laughing)

936
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,627
- No, this can't be happening.

937
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,977
It can't, it can't!

938
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,177
- What is it, Jeff?

939
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,437
- It's all right, folks.

940
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,277
- Are you sick?

941
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,595
Do you wanna go to the hospital?

942
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,087
- You're clowns, you're all clowns!

943
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:11,707
- Nice talk on your birthday.

944
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,807
- Kerry, listen to me.

945
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,177
The curse, it's true.

946
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,397
I mean, you all look
like circus clowns to me!

947
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,197
You act like them when I'm looking at you.

948
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,937
- Well, don't you like clowns, Jeff?

949
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,857
I do, they're very amusing fellows.

950
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,747
- You're not supposed to look like them.

951
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,547
- Listen, Jeff, we're
gonna take you out of here.

952
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,883
Keep your eyes closed if that helps you.

953
00:44:31,273 --> 00:44:33,493
(Jeff groans)

954
00:44:33,576 --> 00:44:36,540
(Somber piano music)

955
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:41,623
(Patrons laugh) (Playful carnival music)

956
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,777
- [Dr. Fiasco] Now, Jeff,
you've had a good night's sleep.

957
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,775
Would you like to try
to take the blindfold off?

958
00:45:09,858 --> 00:45:12,937
- No, you'll look like a clown.

959
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,427
- Jeff, you've been under a lot of strain.

960
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,347
It's entirely possible that everything

961
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:18,725
will be all right today.

962
00:45:18,808 --> 00:45:22,053
Last night may have simply
been the result of stress.

963
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,253
- All right, I'll take the blindfold off.

964
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,387
You look normal.

965
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:35,220
- Good.

966
00:45:35,303 --> 00:45:38,137
Now I'm just going to give
you a little physical exam.

967
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,267
First, I want to test your reflexes.

968
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:41,643
Cross your legs please.

969
00:45:42,726 --> 00:45:43,627
(Stick whacks) - Ow!

970
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,127
- Good, he's got a reaction.

971
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,344
- What the hell are you doing?

972
00:45:46,427 --> 00:45:47,317
Stop that! - What's the matter?

973
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,214
Don't you like that?

974
00:45:48,297 --> 00:45:49,047
- Stop it.

975
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,617
- Well, I guess that's normal.

976
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,563
Now I'm going to check your pulse.

977
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,015
Oh, good, completely normal, wonderful.

978
00:45:57,098 --> 00:45:59,479
And I bet you have a squeaky nose too.

979
00:45:59,562 --> 00:46:01,320
Yes, you do! - Stop that, doctor!

980
00:46:01,403 --> 00:46:02,547
This is not funny.

981
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:04,027
- Of course, it isn't.

982
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,347
I can't let you leave here

983
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,627
unless you appear completely rational.

984
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:08,767
- I'm rational?

985
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:10,327
You're the other one out of your tiny mind.

986
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,367
- Now, Jeff, you must cooperate.

987
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:14,600
Don't be frightened, this won't hurt a bit.

988
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,797
- Dr. Fiasco.

989
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,657
- I was giving Jeff a physical exam,

990
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:22,087
but he's been acting very strangely.

991
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:26,017
- Kerry, don't let her
make a fool of me anymore.

992
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,937
- I'm afraid whenever he looks at people,

993
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,307
they appear to behave in a clownish manner.

994
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,507
I'll leave you alone with him.

995
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,183
You may have a calming effect.

996
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,437
- All right, Jeff.

997
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,267
Everything's gonna be all right.

998
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,097
- How can you say that?

999
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,647
The whole world's turned upside down.

1000
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,608
My crazy brother's gone
sane and I've gone insane.

1001
00:46:44,691 --> 00:46:48,817
- No, no, Jeff, you just
have a slight handicap.

1002
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,007
Please take your hands down and look at me.

1003
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:54,487
- No, no, you'll act like a clown.

1004
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,677
- Jeff, I love you.

1005
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,527
I wouldn't do anything to hurt you.

1006
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:00,663
Please.

1007
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:04,263
- All right.

1008
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:08,077
- What do you see?

1009
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,753
- You've got a big red nose.

1010
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:12,007
- Well, that's not so bad.

1011
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,897
- Maybe not at Christmas time.

1012
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,177
For the rest of the
year, you'll look silly.

1013
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,827
- But Jeff, I don't really look like this.

1014
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:18,660
It's all in your mind.

1015
00:47:18,743 --> 00:47:20,600
- I know, I know.

1016
00:47:20,683 --> 00:47:23,317
But what am I supposed
to do the rest of my life?

1017
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,117
I mean, wear this blindfold?

1018
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,819
What are people gonna say
when they see me like this?

1019
00:47:27,902 --> 00:47:31,417
(Kerry imitates western movie music)

1020
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,447
Very funny, ha-ha.

1021
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:35,467
- Whoa, Nelly, Jeff.

1022
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:36,847
Don't lose your sense of humor.

1023
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,337
- Since when do you say, whoa, Nelly?

1024
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,677
- Jeff, the best that we
can hope for is that we can

1025
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,927
find some way to break this curse.

1026
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:46,267
We're searching for
every shred of information

1027
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:47,677
to help us with this.

1028
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,017
- Well, I know one thing for sure.

1029
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,457
I believe in it.

1030
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,937
I definitely believe in this curse.

1031
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,027
- Well, maybe that's half the battle.

1032
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,367
Just believe in us too, Jeff-e-roo!

1033
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:58,470
- Jeff-e-roo?

1034
00:47:58,553 --> 00:48:01,074
- I'll be back as soon as I can.

1035
00:48:01,157 --> 00:48:03,067
(Can sprays)

1036
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,014
Just remember, always
keep laughing! (Chuckles)

1037
00:48:06,097 --> 00:48:07,237
(Hand slaps)

1038
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,027
(Shoes clacking)

1039
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,007
- Jasper, I'm going to the asylum

1040
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,747
to visit your brother, okay?

1041
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:16,717
You just stay here and be a good adult.

1042
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,277
- I understand completely.

1043
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,557
May I pose you with a few questions?

1044
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,603
- Fire away.

1045
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,387
- Do you think Jeff will
regain his senses as I have?

1046
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,057
Do you think he'll ever marry Kerry?

1047
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:28,747
Do you think we'll find
a way to break the curse

1048
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:29,857
upon this family?

1049
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,667
Is it possible... - Jasper, Jasper.

1050
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,253
Too many questions.

1051
00:48:34,336 --> 00:48:36,397
I don't have all the answers.

1052
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,230
Believe me.

1053
00:48:37,313 --> 00:48:39,907
I wish I did know somebody
that did know them all.

1054
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:40,940
I'll see you later.

1055
00:48:42,177 --> 00:48:44,594
(Door bangs)

1056
00:48:50,813 --> 00:48:53,313
(Phone rings)

1057
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,127
- Shakee mutual trust,
Steve weevil speaking.

1058
00:48:57,210 --> 00:48:58,867
- Hello, Steve.

1059
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,997
This is Jasper coukos.

1060
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:04,417
You sold me an exciting
life insurance policy recently

1061
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,967
and said that if I had
any questions to call you.

1062
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:08,377
- Oh, sure, sure, Mr. Coukos.

1063
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,517
What's on your mind?

1064
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,140
- I'd like for you to tell
me how to raise the dead.

1065
00:49:13,223 --> 00:49:15,577
- (Laughs) Very funny, Mr. Coukos.

1066
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:16,987
Anyone in particular?

1067
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:19,117
- Well, it's a witch
named hepzibah Crowley.

1068
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,087
You see, she's put a curse on my family.

1069
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,677
And it was my thought that if we could,

1070
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,246
well, bring her back to life,

1071
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:28,833
that we could possibly talk
her into removing the curse.

1072
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:31,807
- Well, Mr. Coukos,

1073
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:33,967
I really don't have
time for practical jokes.

1074
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,917
- Oh, I'm quite serious about this.

1075
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,737
You did say I could ask you anything.

1076
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,717
- But not about raising the dead.

1077
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,517
I don't know that.

1078
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,176
- Well, Steve, if that's the case,

1079
00:49:45,259 --> 00:49:49,087
I'd better cancel my
policy with your company

1080
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,917
if you can't answer my questions.

1081
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,495
- No, don't do that.

1082
00:49:52,578 --> 00:49:53,587
Hold on.

1083
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,443
I'll look this up in my file.

1084
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:01,717
Yes, Mr. Coukos, raising the dead.

1085
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,117
I have that here in my
worksheet right now, yes.

1086
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,250
Do you have a pencil?

1087
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,817
Good, well, you take a
bottle of witch Hazel, yes.

1088
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,107
And then dump it all over the ground.

1089
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,483
And then you buy a book.

1090
00:50:14,017 --> 00:50:16,237
"The house of seven
gables," that's the book.

1091
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,867
And you read it backwards and very fast.

1092
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,127
Very fast and backwards.

1093
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:24,277
And then if that doesn't bring
her back, well, nothing will.

1094
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,170
- Well, that sounds easy enough.

1095
00:50:27,253 --> 00:50:29,287
Thank you for your help, Steve.

1096
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:31,203
- Not at all, anytime.

1097
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,193
Crazy son of a bitch.

1098
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,827
- So Kerry also acted strangely

1099
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,417
when you took the blindfold off.

1100
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,627
- Right, and she had a big red nose.

1101
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,517
- This is very interesting.

1102
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,197
Do you see the pattern?

1103
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,587
To you, everybody else seems
insane when you look at them,

1104
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:53,047
but you feel perfectly normal.

1105
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,897
This may be a projection
of your own insanity

1106
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,997
onto everybody else.

1107
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,935
Because you can't face the reality,

1108
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:02,643
which is that you are
the one with the problem.

1109
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,317
There are no clowns here, Jeff.

1110
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,383
Logically, you know that, don't you?

1111
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,907
- [Performer] Are you Dr. Fiasco?

1112
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:10,740
- Yes.

1113
00:51:10,823 --> 00:51:13,177
- Happy birthday, Dr. Fiasco!

1114
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,343
From your staff!

1115
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,072
- What's the matter?

1116
00:51:17,155 --> 00:51:19,237
(June shouts)

1117
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,187
- What's wrong with you people?

1118
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:22,195
- But what is it?

1119
00:51:22,278 --> 00:51:23,887
- It's a clown.

1120
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:25,317
- You see them too?

1121
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,363
Then I'm not crazy!

1122
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,393
What clown?

1123
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:37,057
(Playful carnival music)

1124
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,437
- Your people are nuts.

1125
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,663
I'm quitting this job.

1126
00:51:40,721 --> 00:51:44,304
(Carnival music continues)

1127
00:51:45,165 --> 00:51:47,748
(Chair clangs)

1128
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:52,243
- Ah.

1129
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:56,227
This looks like the place.

1130
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:57,513
Let's see now.

1131
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:02,287
Pour witch Hazel over the grave.

1132
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:05,864
And let's see.

1133
00:52:05,947 --> 00:52:07,827
"House of seven gables."

1134
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,210
Halfway down a by street
of one of our new England...

1135
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,477
Oh, backwards, I read it backwards.

1136
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:17,857
I don't wanna mess this up, let's see.

1137
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,263
And fast, yes.

1138
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:21,127
Story from the house of seven gables

1139
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,297
of a spirit's joy upon her harpsichord,

1140
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,268
as she floated heavenwards off to kindred.

1141
00:52:23,351 --> 00:52:25,177
(Jasper reading indistinctly)

1142
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,280
Bygone it seemed the present hepzibah.

1143
00:52:26,363 --> 00:52:28,177
(Jasper reading indistinctly)

1144
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,428
From the ruinous porch
seemed to hear the bell sound

1145
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:30,474
incredibly well.

1146
00:52:30,557 --> 00:52:34,546
(Jasper reading indistinctly)

1147
00:52:34,629 --> 00:52:37,296
(Witch wailing)

1148
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:39,932
(Smoke hissing)

1149
00:52:40,015 --> 00:52:42,682
(Witch wailing)

1150
00:52:46,724 --> 00:52:48,615
- Hey, lady, lady, what's wrong?

1151
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,000
Where did you come from?

1152
00:52:51,083 --> 00:52:52,602
- Where am I?

1153
00:52:52,685 --> 00:52:53,617
Who are you?

1154
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,387
- I'm Sam Lindquist, judge Lindquist.

1155
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:56,227
- Judge?

1156
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,337
Not another judge.

1157
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,538
- I'm the only judge in these parts.

1158
00:52:59,621 --> 00:53:02,739
- This is not my time.

1159
00:53:02,822 --> 00:53:04,537
- What time?

1160
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,037
What's the last thing you remember?

1161
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,797
- I was burning at the stake.

1162
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,037
Then I heard some idiot
reading something backwards.

1163
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,304
- Come inside, I'll call
someone that can help you.

1164
00:53:14,387 --> 00:53:17,107
- You'll call no one on my behalf.

1165
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,267
I trust no judge!

1166
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:23,222
I'll be bound you condemned
many to death or imprisonment.

1167
00:53:23,305 --> 00:53:24,517
- No, not many.

1168
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,847
Most of of my cases are
civil cases, small claims.

1169
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:30,242
- I can hear your voice now.

1170
00:53:30,325 --> 00:53:34,537
I condemn thee to burn
at the stake until dead.

1171
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,897
I condemn thee to hang until dead.

1172
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,607
- I do no such thing.

1173
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:40,807
Come inside, please.

1174
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:41,767
We'll talk this over.

1175
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:45,398
- Judges love to hear the
sound of their own voices.

1176
00:53:45,481 --> 00:53:48,307
How many witches did you put to death?

1177
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:50,367
- Lady, there are no such thing as witches.

1178
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:52,447
- No such thing as witches?

1179
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,697
I, hepzibah Crowley, am a witch.

1180
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:56,406
A most powerful witch!

1181
00:53:56,489 --> 00:54:00,564
I'll teach you the truth about witches.

1182
00:54:00,647 --> 00:54:02,467
- Lady, come inside.

1183
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:05,737
Please, you need help,
everything will be all right.

1184
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,897
- I'll fix that voice of yours.

1185
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,376
I'll make you the laughing
stock of the county.

1186
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:12,396
(Dramatic music)

1187
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,207
(Judge coughs)

1188
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:17,117
Wait, wait, come back here!

1189
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,355
My voice, something's happened to my voice.

1190
00:54:19,438 --> 00:54:21,573
I've got a big case tomorrow!

1191
00:54:23,835 --> 00:54:26,617
- I remember all.

1192
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,131
The loons!

1193
00:54:28,214 --> 00:54:31,057
(Laughs) Powers of darkness,

1194
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,633
bring me to the last of the loons!

1195
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:39,097
(Thunder cracks)

1196
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,417
- Everything will be okay, June.

1197
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,991
You'll see. - Oh, poor Jeff.

1198
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:44,463
I warned him.

1199
00:54:44,546 --> 00:54:46,593
I only tried to do what was right.

1200
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,233
Where's Jasper?

1201
00:54:50,073 --> 00:54:53,137
Ah, I told him to stay here!

1202
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:53,977
- He'll be back.

1203
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:55,707
Everything will be okay, you'll see.

1204
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:58,837
(Eerie music)

1205
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,998
- Where is the last of the loons?

1206
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:03,727
(Thunder cracks)

1207
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:04,930
Where is

1208
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:07,163
everybody?

1209
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,417
- Who in blue blazes are you?

1210
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,745
- From blue blazes, I come.

1211
00:55:12,828 --> 00:55:16,657
I am hepzibah Crowley. - As in witch?

1212
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:18,003
- It is so.

1213
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,607
- What a surprise.

1214
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:22,897
Make yourself at home.

1215
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,477
Kerry and I were just heading out the door

1216
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,947
to buy airline tickets.

1217
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,117
- Airplanes, who needs airplanes?

1218
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,887
My car has a full tank.

1219
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:31,507
- Stay where you are.

1220
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:34,147
Tell me where the last of the loons are.

1221
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,917
- Why, hello everyone.

1222
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,387
Why, who's that person there?

1223
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,917
- Witch. - That one right there.

1224
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,750
- Witch!

1225
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:41,737
- I said which one,
that person right there.

1226
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,507
- It's a witch, Jasper.

1227
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,007
The witch, get it!

1228
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:45,923
- Oh.

1229
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:49,957
- A loon, I know it is so.

1230
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,237
I am hepzibah Crowley.

1231
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,676
- Oh, well this is a surprise.

1232
00:55:53,759 --> 00:55:55,597
I didn't think it worked.

1233
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,297
- Then it was you who
raised me from the grave?

1234
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,213
- Yes.

1235
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,817
- Oh, then you have fallen to the curse.

1236
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,237
Only a madman would
bring me back from the dead.

1237
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,567
- No, no, I was mad, but I'm very sane now.

1238
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:11,400
Very sane.

1239
00:56:11,483 --> 00:56:13,777
Besides, I can't take
all the credit for this.

1240
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:17,557
It was Steve weevil who
told me how to raise the dead.

1241
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,567
- Steve weevil.

1242
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:22,387
My insurance man knows
how to raise the dead?

1243
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,667
Boy, they'll do anything
to avoid paying a claim.

1244
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,637
- Where can I find this powerful warlock?

1245
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,583
- Well, here's his card right there.

1246
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,247
- I'll be back for you.

1247
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:34,477
- Fine, we'll brew some coffee.

1248
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,410
Won't we, mother?

1249
00:56:36,307 --> 00:56:38,807
(Eerie music)

1250
00:56:48,933 --> 00:56:51,683
(Pages rustling)

1251
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:57,617
(Steve shouts)

1252
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,407
- Who the hell are you?

1253
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:02,437
- You mean who from hell are you?

1254
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,804
- Lady, how the hell did you get in here?

1255
00:57:04,887 --> 00:57:07,987
- You are the one called Steve weevil?

1256
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:09,697
- Yeah, I am the one.

1257
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,605
Which one are you?

1258
00:57:10,688 --> 00:57:14,673
- I am hepzibah Crowley, a witch.

1259
00:57:14,756 --> 00:57:19,147
You knew of the spell that
would raise me from my grave?

1260
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:22,237
Just how powerful a warlock are you?

1261
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,177
- Lady, I don't have
the tiniest, smallest idea

1262
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,340
what in god's name you're talking about.

1263
00:57:27,423 --> 00:57:29,917
Now, would you please leave my office?

1264
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,939
I'm sure you're late for
your electro shock therapy.

1265
00:57:32,022 --> 00:57:34,477
(Eerie music)

1266
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,169
- Your mouth spills
forth meaningless drivel.

1267
00:57:37,252 --> 00:57:39,877
I shan't leave until you
answer my question.

1268
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,907
Did you not give one Jasper loon the secret

1269
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:44,467
for raising the dead?

1270
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:46,612
- I know a Jasper coukos, not loon.

1271
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:49,897
- Answer me, large-mouthed one.

1272
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,614
Did you tell him the
secret of raising the dead?

1273
00:57:52,697 --> 00:57:55,517
- It was a crackpot I sold
an insurance policy too.

1274
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,034
He asked me a stupid question,

1275
00:57:57,117 --> 00:57:58,597
and I gave him a stupid answer.

1276
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,517
I got rid of him, no harm done.

1277
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,904
- That spell brought me
back from peaceful death.

1278
00:58:04,987 --> 00:58:09,987
I had no desire to return
to this wretched existence.

1279
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,697
But now that I am here,

1280
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,638
I shall complete my revenge on the loons.

1281
00:58:16,721 --> 00:58:19,554
(Energy whirring)

1282
00:58:21,575 --> 00:58:23,797
- How did you do that? - You fool.

1283
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,377
My power is in my eyes.

1284
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,377
What an ignorant age this is.

1285
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:33,427
Your mouth far exceeds your intelligence.

1286
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,557
I will make the two equal.

1287
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,984
Your mouth will be as small as your brain.

1288
00:58:39,067 --> 00:58:41,567
(Eerie music)

1289
00:58:45,843 --> 00:58:48,420
(Hepzibah laughs)

1290
00:58:48,503 --> 00:58:51,003
(Energy zaps)

1291
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,497
(Energy zaps)

1292
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:00,547
So you are a loon.

1293
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:02,841
Or should I say coukos?

1294
00:59:02,924 --> 00:59:04,037
- Who's there?

1295
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:05,005
Why can't I move?

1296
00:59:05,088 --> 00:59:08,407
- It is I, hepzibah Crowley!

1297
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:09,817
- The witch?

1298
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:10,717
You're the witch that...

1299
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:15,397
- yes, your silly brother
brought me back to this sphere.

1300
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,201
Now, I can see my handiwork at firsthand.

1301
00:59:19,284 --> 00:59:22,083
You are insane.

1302
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:28,100
But as for the other,
I know not what he is.

1303
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:31,417
- He was insane, at birth.

1304
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,397
But the curse worked backwards.

1305
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,257
He went sane at his last birthday.

1306
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:38,553
- So my revenge is not yet complete.

1307
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,482
Very well.

1308
00:59:40,565 --> 00:59:45,307
The last of the loons will
suffer the same fate as I did.

1309
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:49,473
Death at the stake! (Energy zaps)

1310
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,610
- I've gotta warn them!

1311
00:59:52,471 --> 00:59:55,388
(Fingers punching)

1312
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,797
- This, this is embarrassing, but my voice,

1313
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,150
something has happened to my voice.

1314
01:00:10,233 --> 01:00:12,097
I wanna know whether or not my throat

1315
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:14,423
is covered on my insurance policy!

1316
01:00:14,506 --> 01:00:17,256
(Pages rustling)

1317
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,947
- Is it an infection?

1318
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:23,124
You seen a doctor?

1319
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:25,220
- What, what did you say?

1320
01:00:25,303 --> 01:00:26,317
I didn't catch that.

1321
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,527
- I'm sorry, something's
happened to my mouth too.

1322
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:31,029
I think it's a spasm.

1323
01:00:31,112 --> 01:00:32,616
I'll have to have it looked at.

1324
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:34,657
- Steve, you're gonna think I'm crazy.

1325
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,457
But this isn't an infection.

1326
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,077
It isn't anything medical.

1327
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,072
It's a spell!

1328
01:00:40,155 --> 01:00:42,307
- A spell? - Yes, yes.

1329
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:45,307
This woman claiming to be a
witch cast a spell on my voice

1330
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:47,407
so I would sound silly.

1331
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:48,637
I didn't believe her at first.

1332
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,228
I thought she was an escaped
lunatic, but now I believe her.

1333
01:00:52,311 --> 01:00:55,864
- My god, that's what happened to me too.

1334
01:00:55,947 --> 01:01:00,247
Was her name hepzibah Crowley?

1335
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:03,697
- Yes, I think that was the name she said.

1336
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,894
She did this to you, why?

1337
01:01:05,977 --> 01:01:08,294
- I brought her back to life.

1338
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:09,690
- [Sam] What?

1339
01:01:09,773 --> 01:01:12,858
- I have this client, the coukos family.

1340
01:01:12,941 --> 01:01:16,429
I met this Jasper coukos,
and I sold him a policy.

1341
01:01:16,512 --> 01:01:19,507
He calls me one day and
asked me how to raise the dead.

1342
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:22,051
I think this guy's crazy so
I just told him the first thing

1343
01:01:22,134 --> 01:01:24,051
that pops into my mind.

1344
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:28,927
- The coukos, they're
connected with this witch?

1345
01:01:29,010 --> 01:01:31,177
She's a menace to the community.

1346
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,277
We must do something.

1347
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,110
- What are you gonna do?

1348
01:01:34,193 --> 01:01:36,907
You couldn't have anybody
arrested for witchcraft nowadays.

1349
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:39,037
No, she needs to be treated on terms

1350
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,370
she's more familiar with.

1351
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:44,647
- You mean a lynch mob?

1352
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:46,200
No, no, we can't sink to that.

1353
01:01:46,283 --> 01:01:49,308
- No, I'm saying that if we
treat her with regular means,

1354
01:01:49,391 --> 01:01:51,157
we're not gonna get anywhere.

1355
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,227
You wanna go around
talking like a cartoon character

1356
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:54,060
for the rest of your life?

1357
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,297
- No!

1358
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,513
- Destroy the witch, destroy the curse.

1359
01:01:59,347 --> 01:02:02,253
- Well, she's already legally dead.

1360
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,237
We need help.

1361
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,247
You know people willing to help us?

1362
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:09,577
- Oh, it's never been
too difficult to find people

1363
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:12,244
who would like to do this sort of thing.

1364
01:02:12,327 --> 01:02:14,587
(Suspenseful music)

1365
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:16,613
- Here's the phone, Jeff. - Thank you.

1366
01:02:18,531 --> 01:02:21,891
(Suspenseful music continues)

1367
01:02:21,974 --> 01:02:24,667
(Buttons punching)

1368
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,947
Hello, ma, this is Jeff.

1369
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,683
Listen, the witch was here.

1370
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:30,953
You know?

1371
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:33,787
Jasper brought her back?

1372
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:35,377
And he's out there.

1373
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,927
Listen, ma, she's coming there to get him.

1374
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,597
He's the last sane loon.

1375
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,037
Get out of there now!

1376
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,323
- Okay, Jeff.

1377
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,157
- What are you gonna do with us?

1378
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,717
- [Hepzibah] I am going to
take this one, this Jasper,

1379
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,067
and tie him to a tree
and burn him to death.

1380
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:58,807
- Well, that doesn't sound
like a very sane course

1381
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:00,247
of action to me.

1382
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:01,567
- We'll stop you.

1383
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,277
You'll have to kill us too!

1384
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:06,067
- [Hepzibah] Oh, I plan to.

1385
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:07,717
- Stop giving her suggestions.

1386
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,687
- But first you will help me kill this one.

1387
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:11,857
- Ha!

1388
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,987
What is this, 17th century humor?

1389
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:16,177
- We'd have to be as crazy as Jeff is.

1390
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,893
- You will gladly help.

1391
01:03:20,262 --> 01:03:22,762
(Eerie music)

1392
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:25,623
- Of course, we will.

1393
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:30,877
I haven't set anybody
on fire in simply ages.

1394
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,787
- Yes, Jasper, it'll be fun.

1395
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,947
Burning at the stake is so romantic.

1396
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:38,493
- It sounds hazardous to me.

1397
01:03:40,774 --> 01:03:43,774
(Suspenseful music)

1398
01:03:45,427 --> 01:03:47,797
- Now, Jeff, I'm going to
prove to you once and for all

1399
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,387
that there was no witch at your house

1400
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:50,377
threatening your family.

1401
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,047
- Doctor, I'll only be too
happy to be wrong about this.

1402
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:54,427
But for now, let's just hurry.

1403
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:55,410
- All right, Jeff.

1404
01:04:00,694 --> 01:04:03,444
(Car door bangs)

1405
01:04:05,544 --> 01:04:07,297
(Car door bangs)

1406
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,827
Oh, I'm sorry, Jeff.

1407
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:10,717
I forgot to leave word at the front desk.

1408
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:11,677
I'll only be a minute.

1409
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,937
- No, we can't wait!

1410
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,041
We've gotta get to my house.

1411
01:04:14,124 --> 01:04:17,437
- Jeff, I have other patients
who need me as much as you do.

1412
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,078
I have to let the staff know
where I am in case I'm needed.

1413
01:04:20,161 --> 01:04:23,364
- No, this is more important!
- I'll be right back.

1414
01:04:23,447 --> 01:04:26,283
- My whole family could
be wiped out by then!

1415
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:29,303
The keys.

1416
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:32,917
Okay, Jeff, pull yourself together.

1417
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,987
It doesn't matter what the car looks like,

1418
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:37,237
just as long as it gets you there.

1419
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,370
And I'm not waiting for her to come back.

1420
01:04:40,315 --> 01:04:44,403
(Playful carnival music)

1421
01:04:44,486 --> 01:04:46,799
(Car door slams)

1422
01:04:46,882 --> 01:04:50,299
(Playful carnival music)

1423
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,673
Not bad, I can live with this.

1424
01:05:00,687 --> 01:05:02,857
(Car door bangs)

1425
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:05,741
(Car engine revs)

1426
01:05:05,824 --> 01:05:10,824
(Clown chattering comically)
(Instrument clanging)

1427
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:22,747
- (Laughs) Now you of the loon blood.

1428
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,387
You shall suffer as I did.

1429
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:26,853
- This is highly irregular.

1430
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:32,251
- Hello, judge, it's me.

1431
01:05:32,334 --> 01:05:33,637
I found her, yeah.

1432
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,257
She's just about to murder Jasper coukos.

1433
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,567
You go get the boys,
I'll try and hold her off.

1434
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:40,117
- You know, this won't
look good on a resume.

1435
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,007
- Once you have expired,

1436
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:45,127
I will be able to go back
to my grave in peace.

1437
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:47,377
- Oh, please take us with you

1438
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:50,317
so we may serve you in the afterlife!

1439
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,777
- You wish to follow me into hell?

1440
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,547
- We'll wear light clothing.

1441
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:57,487
- Yes, I've got this
darling little cotton dress

1442
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:59,587
I've only worn once.

1443
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:02,673
- [Hepzibah] Enough,
slaves, who has a match?

1444
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:04,563
- Not me.

1445
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:06,967
- Me either.

1446
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,047
- Well, don't look at me.

1447
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,806
Personally, I think you've
gone beyond the bounds

1448
01:06:09,889 --> 01:06:11,317
of good taste.

1449
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:12,333
- Stop, wait!

1450
01:06:13,213 --> 01:06:16,237
- It is you, the small-mouthed one.

1451
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,307
- Will you permit me to speak normally?

1452
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:19,777
- Oh, very well.

1453
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,162
But briefly will I lift the spell.

1454
01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:24,667
(Eerie music)

1455
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,897
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

1456
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,747
Oh, I can speak again.

1457
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:30,907
Listen, it occurred to me when you said

1458
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:32,257
all the power was in your eyes

1459
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:35,001
that a conscientious witch like you

1460
01:06:35,084 --> 01:06:37,207
should have eye insurance.

1461
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:39,127
- What nonsense is this?

1462
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:40,177
- Oh, I'd listened to Steve.

1463
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,874
He sold me a great policy.

1464
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:45,697
By the way, Steve, am I
covered for loss due to fire?

1465
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:48,097
- I think it's time you
seriously considered

1466
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:51,559
catastrophic events, such
as impaired vision, blindness,

1467
01:06:51,642 --> 01:06:53,137
itchy, watery eyes.

1468
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,297
Now, with this policy, you're
covered for the following.

1469
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:57,187
For the insured's accidental
loss of the following,

1470
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:59,257
we pay the following amounts.

1471
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:02,437
Loss of life, twice the amount.

1472
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:03,967
Loss of feet.

1473
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:06,967
Sight in both eyes.

1474
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:10,383
One hand, one foot.

1475
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:15,080
One hand and the sight of one eye.

1476
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:19,947
One foot, one hand.

1477
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,593
Loss of one eye.

1478
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:29,883
On rye with Mayo on the side.

1479
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,047
Asleep, are you?

1480
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:33,922
Ah, too bad.

1481
01:07:34,005 --> 01:07:36,393
Mm, never underestimate
the power of boredom.

1482
01:07:38,042 --> 01:07:38,993
- What happened?

1483
01:07:39,076 --> 01:07:41,167
- How did we get out here?

1484
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,117
- What did you do to her?

1485
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:44,617
- Help me tie her to this tree.

1486
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,717
- Oh, finish telling us
about that policy, Steve.

1487
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,732
- Shut up.

1488
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:52,815
(Townspeople shouting) (Suspenseful music)

1489
01:07:58,276 --> 01:07:59,107
- We're here, Steve.

1490
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:01,207
- I put her in a trance, my way.

1491
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,377
Are the boys here to do the job?

1492
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,469
- Yes, they're ready.

1493
01:08:03,552 --> 01:08:04,994
But Steve, your voice, it's normal.

1494
01:08:05,077 --> 01:08:07,777
- Oh yeah, I got her to
lift the curse temporarily.

1495
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,311
But don't worry, once she's dead,

1496
01:08:09,394 --> 01:08:11,227
everything will be back to normal.

1497
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:13,758
- What makes you think
everything will be back to normal?

1498
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:15,517
What are you gonna do to her?

1499
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,907
- We're gonna serve up
some old-fashioned justice.

1500
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:21,727
The right way to kill a witch
is to burn her at the stake!

1501
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:22,560
Right, boys?

1502
01:08:22,643 --> 01:08:25,897
- [Townspeople] Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1503
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:28,657
- Oh, I thought we were
going to burn her like a steak.

1504
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:31,177
- Oh, I thought we were going to burn her

1505
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:33,127
as one would a steak.

1506
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:35,573
- I didn't bring any steak,
all I brought was fish.

1507
01:08:35,656 --> 01:08:37,777
- What kind of a lynch mob are you?

1508
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:38,610
- Come on, judge.

1509
01:08:38,693 --> 01:08:40,443
We'll do the job ourselves.

1510
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,227
- No, Steve, wait!

1511
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:45,534
We can't do it this way.

1512
01:08:45,617 --> 01:08:48,617
This is not the right
way, we're civilized men.

1513
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,107
Here, here, use my lighter.

1514
01:08:52,316 --> 01:08:54,169
- All right, ma, ma! - Here, Jeff.

1515
01:08:54,252 --> 01:08:55,458
- Jeff, how did you get here?

1516
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:57,367
- You'd never believe me.

1517
01:08:57,450 --> 01:08:58,297
What's going on?

1518
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,703
- They're gonna burn hepzibah.

1519
01:08:59,786 --> 01:09:02,257
- Ah, let her burn, it's been a rough week.

1520
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:03,991
- We can't, don't you see?

1521
01:09:04,074 --> 01:09:06,817
Hepzibah being dead
isn't gonna break the curse.

1522
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,317
We have to save her.

1523
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,073
If she dies again, we'll
never have another chance.

1524
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:16,237
(Townspeople chattering)

1525
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,227
- Excuse me.

1526
01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:19,778
Mob, oh mob, may I
have your attention please?

1527
01:09:19,861 --> 01:09:22,837
Now you say that it's
right to burn witches.

1528
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,397
Does that mean all witches?

1529
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:26,527
- [Townspeople] Yeah, yeah!

1530
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:28,807
- Yes, I'm judge and I say it's right!

1531
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:29,677
- Well, in that case,

1532
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,047
I'd like to point out
that this man is a witch.

1533
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:35,017
He turned my cat into an avocado!

1534
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:37,009
- That's, that's not true.

1535
01:09:37,092 --> 01:09:37,842
(Townspeople chattering)

1536
01:09:37,925 --> 01:09:39,427
- Oh, I get it.

1537
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:40,503
This woman is a witch!

1538
01:09:40,586 --> 01:09:41,527
(Townspeople shout)

1539
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:44,673
She has the power to
turn water into ice cubes!

1540
01:09:44,756 --> 01:09:46,237
- No, not me.

1541
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,857
- Yes, and I happen to know

1542
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:50,306
this woman plays bridge with armadillos!

1543
01:09:50,389 --> 01:09:54,157
- I never play bridge with armadillos.

1544
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:57,517
- [Jeff] I saw this man
riding Satan's bicycle!

1545
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,767
- I never rode Satan's bicycle!

1546
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:01,627
- There's too many witches out there.

1547
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:02,575
What are we gonna do?

1548
01:10:02,658 --> 01:10:03,937
We don't have that much kindling.

1549
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:06,470
- Judge, I heard you say last
year that you'd sell your soul

1550
01:10:06,553 --> 01:10:08,467
for some world series tickets.

1551
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:10,187
- Yeah, that's right, and I saw him there.

1552
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:12,155
I saw him in the stands on TV.

1553
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:15,070
- It wasn't me, I wasn't there!

1554
01:10:15,153 --> 01:10:17,512
- (Screams) I confess!

1555
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:19,740
I'm possessed by Satan!

1556
01:10:19,823 --> 01:10:23,619
Recipes for quiche manifest
themselves on my skin!

1557
01:10:23,702 --> 01:10:24,628
(Citizen shouts)

1558
01:10:24,711 --> 01:10:27,037
(Townspeople chattering)

1559
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,467
- This is getting out of hand,
maybe we should knock it off.

1560
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:31,057
- Let her go, Sam!

1561
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:31,973
- All right.

1562
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:35,193
Listen, folks, folks!

1563
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:38,317
There seems to have been a big mistake.

1564
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,297
We wanna thank you for coming out though.

1565
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,217
You've been a great mob, really.

1566
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,227
Next time we need a
mindless mass of people,

1567
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:45,683
we'll be sure to call you.

1568
01:10:45,766 --> 01:10:47,757
(Townspeople groaning)

1569
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,257
(Townspeople chattering)

1570
01:10:53,174 --> 01:10:54,944
- Ah, there we are.

1571
01:10:55,027 --> 01:10:56,377
Hepzibah, wake up! (Fingers snapping)

1572
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,603
Wake up, hepzibah!

1573
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:00,727
- What happened?

1574
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:02,854
- Well, Steve here subdued you into sleep

1575
01:11:02,937 --> 01:11:05,407
with some boring insurance jargon.

1576
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:08,827
Well, and then this mob here
was going to burn you to death.

1577
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:09,967
- Why didn't they?

1578
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,227
- Well, we stopped them.

1579
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:14,009
- You, the Coukos's?

1580
01:11:14,092 --> 01:11:16,417
Loon blood saved my life?

1581
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,250
- Yes, we have.

1582
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:19,837
And I must say that
you've behaved very badly.

1583
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,547
You've behaved abominably.

1584
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:23,737
And I am never going to
bring you back to life again.

1585
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,477
- You're right.

1586
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,317
I've been an awful nuisance
these last few hundred years.

1587
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,687
I should go back to the grave.

1588
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:33,367
- How about removing the curse?

1589
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:34,807
- Very well.

1590
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:36,757
From what I have witnessed,

1591
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:41,493
'tis punishment enough
just to live in this age.

1592
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,847
Loon blood, I cleanse you.

1593
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:48,027
The curse is no more!

1594
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:50,860
(Mystical music)

1595
01:11:58,170 --> 01:11:59,819
- You're all normal.

1596
01:11:59,902 --> 01:12:00,819
I'm normal!

1597
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:03,831
- Ah!

1598
01:12:03,914 --> 01:12:06,914
(Suspenseful music)

1599
01:12:12,914 --> 01:12:15,090
Oh, there he is!

1600
01:12:15,173 --> 01:12:18,008
- Ma, this is Kerry, my fiancee.

1601
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:19,672
- Hi, nice to meet you. - Congratulations.

1602
01:12:19,755 --> 01:12:21,390
Jeff's told me all about you.

1603
01:12:21,473 --> 01:12:23,091
This is Jeff's brother Jasper.

1604
01:12:23,174 --> 01:12:24,391
- Hi. - Hello, Kerry, right?

1605
01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:26,197
- Yes. - Hi, Jasper.

1606
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,237
- Come on in, I've got the coffee ready.

1607
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,655
How was your trip? - Oh, it was great.

1608
01:12:29,738 --> 01:12:32,905
- Oh, good. - We got a wedding to plan.

1609
01:12:34,115 --> 01:12:37,115
(People chattering)

1610
01:12:44,673 --> 01:12:48,256
(Solemn harpsichord music)
