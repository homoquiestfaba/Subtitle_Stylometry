1
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,439
Please help me...

2
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:16,011
help...
somebody please help me.

3
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,946
Somebody please help me.

4
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,052
Please help me.

5
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:32,759
You're doing a very
good thing here, Nancy.

6
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,560
You know the good book says
that there is no greater love...

7
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:42,029
than when a man lays down
his life for another.

8
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,567
You're my hero, Nancy.

9
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,687
No!

10
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,596
Okay, easy does it.

11
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,105
That's it.

12
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,843
No! No!

13
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,789
Help! Help! Somebody help!
Please help!

14
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:41,285
Detective Ferguson. I need backup.
Send a bus and three units.

15
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,689
- Help...
- Is he still here?

16
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:45,091
- Yeah.
- I need you to be quiet.

17
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,357
Look!
I need you to be quiet...

18
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:51,036
if you wanna get out of
here alive. You understand?

19
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,171
I heard lots of screaming...

20
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,467
Be quiet.

21
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:00,476
- Help... me. Please untie me.
- Keep it down.

22
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,479
- No, don't leave me here!
- Quiet.

23
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,159
Smile. Smile.

24
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,863
Oh, yes.

25
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:42,750
This was for the girls, but
I guess it works on cops, too.

26
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,432
Well, good morning, sleepy-head.

27
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,628
How you feeling today?

28
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,399
I feel alive, that's for sure.

29
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,839
Yeah, you were out for
quite some time.

30
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,478
Here.

31
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,917
Were you in my bathroom
last night?

32
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,620
No.

33
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:30,917
Somebody was.

34
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,491
Uou weren't even supposed
to wake up until tomorrow.

35
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,062
Somebody was in my bathroom
last night.

36
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,132
It's probably just a bad dream.

37
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:05,792
I want you to take it easy. Don't
put too much stress on your heart.

38
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,450
- Hey, what's wrong?
- He's gonna kill her!

39
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,178
Lay down,
I need you to relax, okay?

40
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,914
Lie down, and take a couple
deep breaths for me, okay?

41
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,182
Come on.

42
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,157
You need to take it easy or you're
gonna tear your sutures apart.

43
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,796
- No, I've gotta get out of here.
- You're in no condition.

44
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,760
- He's gonna kill her!
- In no condition!

45
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,241
You need to relax.
Lay down for me, would you?

46
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,471
- Nice caretaker, Nicky.
- Captain.

47
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,913
Nick, did you get
a good look at him?

48
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,606
No, not really.

49
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,112
I was too busy watching him plunge
a needle into my heart.

50
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,753
Are there any more victims?

51
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,853
Not to my knowledge.

52
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:15,024
Well, as soon as I get better,
I'll get back on the case.

53
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,060
Well, let's hope that's
sooner than later, Nicky.

54
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,891
The mother fucker's
a real predator.

55
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,740
It's like these killings are
pleasure crimes for him.

56
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,638
I got him on the run, now.

57
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,036
Not for long, I guarantee you.

58
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,109
This son of a bitch is gonna set up
shop elsewhere and strike again.

59
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,122
Let's not lay around here
too long now.

60
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,667
- Spare change, sir?
- I don't speak English, asshole.

61
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,891
- Oh, ma'am, ma'am...
- I'm sorry, I don't have any.

62
00:07:54,907 --> 00:08:00,470
For a vet. I'm really
cold out at night.

63
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,515
- This is all I have.
- Gonna get something to eat...

64
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,473
I greatly appreciate.

65
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,751
Oh, that's very kind, ma'am.
Thank you.

66
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:38,405
<i>Can't go to the beach because Janice
thinks this fence prevent suicides.</i>

67
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,409
<i>Like there's no other place in
L.A. County where some idiot...</i>

68
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:52,823
<i>This was the bloodiest day for the
troops since the conflict began in 2003.</i>

69
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:57,519
<i>In local news, another Los Angeles
woman has gone missing.</i>

70
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,926
<i>Following the pattern of abductions
spanning the last few months,</i>

71
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:05,969
<i>Emily Boxer, a 21 year old college
student disappeared last night.</i>

72
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,799
<i>She was last seen in
the Huntington Park area.</i>

73
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:13,968
<i>Police are asking that who have
information pertaining to Emily...</i>

74
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,147
<i>please contact local police.</i>

75
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,324
Ferguson.

76
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,563
Who is this?

77
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,573
You have no idea who the fuck
you're dealing with.

78
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,173
Who the fuck is this?!

79
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,694
Hey, Nick.

80
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,731
You're looking much better.

81
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,199
Almost back to the old Nick.

82
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,167
That's bullshit and you know it.

83
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:32,333
Between the codeine pills, the Paxil,
I'm a walking chemical plant.

84
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,569
I haven't had a decent
night's sleep in weeks.

85
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,215
Yeah, well, we can't have
that now, can we?

86
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,579
Man like you can't be off
the hunt too long.

87
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,244
Listen, let's get back down
to business.

88
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,186
The son of a bitch struck close
to home this last time.

89
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,586
What do you mean?

90
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,024
My neighbor's kid.
Emily Boxer.

91
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,664
Freshman at Stanford
home for the weekend.

92
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:59,929
Let me guess, five seven, blonde,
green sweater, blue jeans.

93
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,231
How the fuck did you know that?

94
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,467
We just recently released that
information to the media.

95
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,008
I saw her last night.

96
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,203
What do you mean,
you saw her last night?

97
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,042
You told me your ass never left
the house last night.

98
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,447
I'm gonna tell you something,
Captain...

99
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,350
and you're probably gonna
think I'm crazy for it.

100
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,060
Probably,
but no more than usual.

101
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,498
I've been having these visions.

102
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,906
I'm not sure
if I'm asleep or awake...

103
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,138
but I've been seeing the girls.

104
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,738
After he's finished with them.

105
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,108
Okay, you're pulling my dick,
right?

106
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,748
Because that makes no sense
to me at all.

107
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,712
It makes no sense
to me either.

108
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,612
But ever since I had
this heart surgery...

109
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,754
I just keep getting
these goddamn visions.

110
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:55,553
I'm just gonna pretend
you didn't say that, Nick...

111
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:58,355
and tell you this...

112
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,158
I need you on the trail of
this son of a bitch.

113
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:06,702
You understand this man's thinking
better than any detective.

114
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,897
Let's be realistic about
the situation, shall we?

115
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,236
There's only so much
I can handle.

116
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,946
Especially with this new heart.

117
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,081
Come on, Nick. I need this
son of a bitch taken down.

118
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,595
Why you pushing me so hard
on this, Captain.

119
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:35,800
I've put my ass on the line
for you many times.

120
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,411
I'm not just spoutin'
gibberish here, okay?

121
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,807
Come on, Nick,
read between the lines.

122
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,049
And you owe me, Nick.

123
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,177
So what're you gonna do?

124
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,977
The Captain told me he was near
beggin' you to come back.

125
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,621
The captain doesn't understand
the concept of retirement.

126
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,381
Come on, man.

127
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,353
I'm sorry.

128
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,459
A lot of crazy shit's been
going down lately.

129
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:04,095
Crazy shit like what?

130
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,321
You'll think I'm insane.

131
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:09,660
I've been seeing the faces
of the victims...

132
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,131
before they're dead.

133
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:15,739
What? Man,
are you taking meds, man?

134
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,807
On and off, yeah.

135
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,444
Makes me feel like shit.

136
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,808
Without your medication you're
probably hallucinating.

137
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:25,778
Yeah, you're probably right.

138
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,419
Bartender, can I get the bill?

139
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,793
Look, man...

140
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:39,596
if there's anything you need, do not
hesitate to give me a call, man.

141
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,095
Yeah.

142
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,268
It'll be good to see you
around my office again.

143
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,379
I'm out of here, man.
Get your shit together.

144
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,819
A Jack.

145
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,157
Is this seat taken?

146
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,160
Help yourself.

147
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,362
Can I buy you a drink.

148
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,439
A diet coke is fine, please.

149
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,381
A diet coke as well.

150
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,646
Following the case much?

151
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,490
Very closely.

152
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:40,181
Here.

153
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,133
Thank you.

154
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,661
Name is Nick.

155
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,774
Kathryn Rose.

156
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,999
You were saying?

157
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,609
It's hard not to follow
the case.

158
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,815
All those innocent girls dying at
the hands of that ruthless murderer.

159
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,598
- What's that look for?
- You can see.

160
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,031
- See what?
- Do you hear them too, Nick?

161
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,626
- Hear who?
- The cries...

162
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,305
at night.

163
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,617
- I don't know where you're going...
- It's the cries of the dead.

164
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,014
Sure they didn't spike
that drink of yours?

165
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:42,790
Don't be alarmed by me, Nick.
I'm a psychic.

166
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,325
What, now you're looking for
new business?

167
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,461
I get the visions, too.

168
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,625
I see the girls after
they've been murdered.

169
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,940
Sometimes even before.

170
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,713
You've been blessed with
a gift also.

171
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,080
Wait...

172
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,651
you're saying you see the girls
in your visions. In your dreams.

173
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,188
Jesus Christ.

174
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,565
I thought I was going insane.

175
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,666
Well, you're the psychic.
What does it mean?

176
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,901
You have a direct entrance way into
the realm of the spirit worlds.

177
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,839
Use it to your advantage.

178
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:45,222
Maybe you'll figure out
a way to stop this animal.

179
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,524
Lady, how'd you even know
I was working the case?

180
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,807
I'm drunk off my ass, so take
your bullshit elsewhere.

181
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,272
Do you have another explanation for
what's been happening to you?

182
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,305
You stay the fuck away from me,
lady. You hear?

183
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,879
In here!

184
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,332
You have beautiful eyes.

185
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,051
Hello.

186
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,914
<i>- Bradley.
- Captain.</i>

187
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,516
Hey, Nick.
You still among the living?

188
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,379
For now.

189
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,122
Given it some thought.

190
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,191
I want in.

191
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:38,556
You're sounding kind of like you're
in the same shape you was in before.

192
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,801
Why don't you get some rest?
I've got you covered.

193
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,407
- Who's working the case?
- Hang on.

194
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,302
Jenkins is gonna handle it.

195
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,716
- Jenkins?
- What are my options?

196
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,844
I can hand you this guy
on a silver platter.

197
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,846
What, more visions, Nick?

198
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:02,486
You sound like you're combining your
favorite drink with those pills.

199
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,048
Bradley,
you said it yourself...

200
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:09,090
I've gotten closer to this fucker
than anyone else has.

201
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,558
Now, Youngblood's looking at
the evidence found at the chamber.

202
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,992
He's getting back to me today.

203
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,257
How'd you get authorizaion
for him to do more tests?

204
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,595
<i>- I've got my methods.
- Your methods?</i>

205
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,100
I should remind that mother fucker
who writes his checks.

206
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:24,242
<i>Look, am I in or not? I'll go it
alone on this one if I have to.</i>

207
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:30,015
All right, you're in, but find
this mother fucker fast.

208
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,146
What's up, Doc?

209
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,444
Slick Nick.
How you doin'?

210
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,213
Good, good.
What have you got for me?

211
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,755
Well, I've examined
the last victim's remains.

212
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,390
This guy was very thorough,
that's for sure.

213
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,054
Leaves nothing
to tip himself off.

214
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:49,791
So, why'd he bury the bodies?

215
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,935
To cover his tracks.

216
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:55,470
Take a look at how smooth
the bones are. Feel them.

217
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,903
Slicker than cat shit.

218
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,443
It's like from a skeletal model
rather than a real person's.

219
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,419
What's this?

220
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:11,453
Some of the remains show evidence
of a caustic substance...

221
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:15,490
but its burning the boans removes
any chance for a chemical match.

222
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,487
That's all you got?

223
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:25,363
I don't have his address or home
phone number, but I'm getting close.

224
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,333
All right.

225
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,644
- Can you give me a minute?
- Sure.

226
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,884
Why are you burning the bodies?

227
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,063
What're you hiding from us?

228
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,432
What're you keeping?

229
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:05,138
Keeping. Doc?

230
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,783
Can you have a look at this?

231
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:20,082
- Bone saw marks.
- That's what I thought.

232
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:23,659
Bastard's cutting them up
and he's taking the organs.

233
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:25,863
Well, I'll be.

234
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,840
That's why he's burning the bodies
to hide the evidence.

235
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,899
I want you to test those marks
against every saw known to man.

236
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,176
I'm on it.

237
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:48,554
Who are you?

238
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,634
Where did you slip?

239
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,136
<i>Tell me why you're here
this time.</i>

240
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,704
Mandatory follow up?

241
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:50,669
I don't know. Why don't you tell me
why you really think I'm here?

242
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:54,209
- We wanna help you.
- How?

243
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,744
By telling me I'm
an obsessive-compulsive?

244
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,974
Or is it a delusional
manic-depressive this week?

245
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,016
Tell me about Jessica.

246
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:06,321
Let's not go there,
shall we?

247
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,793
Why not?

248
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:13,020
Nick, you lost your wife.

249
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,393
We can't help you
if you won't let us.

250
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,375
Why don't you just
up my Prozac?

251
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,439
No, we need to talk about it.

252
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,882
Forget it.

253
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:32,745
Rachel, yeah,
send in my next patient.

254
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,555
I know his hour isn't up yet,
just do what I tell you.

255
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:38,860
This is my hour.

256
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:44,825
Then why don't you spare me
the tough cop routine?

257
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:51,034
And, of the record? You touch me
again and I'll rip your arm off.

258
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:57,135
Now you got my attention, Doc.

259
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,378
Tell me about Jessica.

260
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,139
That asshole blew her brains
out all over the kitchen.

261
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,147
What's left to say?

262
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,897
Sometimes I still find
memories of her...

263
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:18,552
like a hair in the blanket
in the closet...

264
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,538
or under the bed.

265
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,697
It says you're having dreams.

266
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,396
- Are you dreaming about her.
- No.

267
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,268
They're not dreams, Doc.

268
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,718
They're, uh, visions.

269
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,909
I've been seeing the girls
after they're killed.

270
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,848
How often?

271
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,522
Every night.

272
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,491
Nick, are you drinking
when you take your meds?

273
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,804
Let's not go through
that as well.

274
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,166
What does my profile say?

275
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,828
Burgeoning alcoholic?

276
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,407
You can't combine alcohol
and antidepressants.

277
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,942
That is what's giving you
these dreams.

278
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,011
You know, you fucking
people amaze me.

279
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,275
You get us hooked on the chemical,
then you tell us what happens to us.

280
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,883
Listen to me.

281
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,020
These visions are nightmares...

282
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,917
induced by the effects of
alcohol and Prozac.

283
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:25,221
These visions are real. It's not
the booze and it's not the pills.

284
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:28,455
Now, if you had a stitch of talent,
you'd wanna know about 'em.

285
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,873
So you can take your hour
and shove it up your ass.

286
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,037
It's nicer during the day.

287
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:09,875
Hello?

288
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,814
Can I help you with something?

289
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,517
In here!
Would somebody help me!

290
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:27,755
Help me!

291
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:34,631
<i>Bradley, I'm not going crazy.
This shit really happened.</i>

292
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:38,359
I'm beginning to wonder if I made
a mistake by placing you on this case.

293
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,402
- Now you're second-guessing me?
- No, Nick, it's just...

294
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,368
Iook, you need your head
thoroughly examined.

295
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:46,839
Dr. Allbright informed me
about your last session.

296
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:50,639
I know you wanna catch this guy,
but your health comes first?

297
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:54,876
Better not be saying you're
pulling me from the case.

298
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:58,647
Do me a favor, Nick.
Go get some rest, huh?

299
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,951
I'm busting my ass to solve this case
and this is the thanks I get?

300
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,217
Look, Nick...

301
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,465
If I can't talk to you about this,
then who can I talk to?

302
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:14,399
Nick, my door is always
open for you.

303
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:17,836
I just wanna see
the old Nick back in action.

304
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,010
There's no harm in that, right?

305
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:44,658
So what exactly
are we looking for?

306
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,304
Whatever it is, there's something
not right in here.

307
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,874
You better not be
setting me up, Kathryn.

308
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,678
Doesn't look like much of
a transportation company.

309
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,819
Kathryn, how'd you know
that was in there?

310
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,813
I'm just trying to help.

311
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,652
What exactly are you
getting out of this?

312
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,887
It's the right thing
to do, isn't it?

313
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:24,432
You and I both get visions
that are tied to this case.

314
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,605
We're connected in a way that
no one else can understand.

315
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,831
If I get premonitions that
can help solve these crimes...

316
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,214
you're the only one
I can turn to.

317
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,446
What're you afraid of, Nick?

318
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:40,180
You're the psychic.
You tell me.

319
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,851
You're afraid of loss...

320
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:48,025
because of the way
you lost your wife.

321
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,853
Don't fucking go there.

322
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,428
Everyone experiences lost,
Nick...

323
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,589
but not everyone
experiences love...

324
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:59,974
which is what made your
wife's death more tragic.

325
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,771
But no matter what
you believe...

326
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,842
it wasn't your fault.

327
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:10,673
I'm not discussing
this any further.

328
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:14,818
Running away doesn't put any more
distance between you and the past.

329
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:26,567
Detective Ferguson. I need a CSI unit
down here at Huntington Park.

330
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:34,296
A report just arrived this morning.
You've got impeccable timing.

331
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:37,566
And I know who the remains
belong to as well.

332
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,301
What're you trying
to do my job, too?

333
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,377
Just read it, will you, Doc?

334
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,749
Victim, Emily Marie Boxer.

335
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,512
Address 1150 Seward Street.

336
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,622
Are you sure?
How did they call it?

337
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:56,065
Dental records
were a spot-on match.

338
00:33:57,902 --> 00:34:00,621
Captain's gonna be
shittin' bricks.

339
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:04,961
I don't know who leaked it
to the press.

340
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,934
Certainly not one of my people.

341
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,539
Listen, you don't have to
tell me that, all right?

342
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,574
We've gotta run some quick
damage control on this!

343
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:17,111
Yeah, Roland, my best man
has a good lead.

344
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:19,021
We're on this prick's scent.

345
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:24,791
Yeah. I understand, Roland.
Yes. Goodbye.

346
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:35,866
Fucking media. How did they find out
it was Emily before you did?

347
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:39,127
I dunno. Youngblood only got
the file this morning.

348
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:42,567
Those fucking leeches. They'll
sell information for anything.

349
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,401
I think they fucking
enjoy this shit.

350
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,838
Bradley, make it good.

351
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:50,173
It's Youngblood, Captain.
I need to find Nick.

352
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:53,282
Fine. Hang on. Nick.
Youngblood.

353
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,151
Ferguson.

354
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:59,982
<i>I hope the Captain knows the media
leak did not come from me.</i>

355
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,215
Nah, he knows you didn't
leak it to the media.

356
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,450
<i>Thank God.</i>

357
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:07,893
I forgot to tell you. We've done
the legwork on those surgical saws.

358
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:08,997
What have you got for me?

359
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:11,895
<i>I can't say you're
gonna like it. We've got nothing.</i>

360
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,434
How difficult is it to trace
the origin of a surgical saw?

361
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,140
<i>More difficult
than I thought, buddy.</i>

362
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,469
<i>Seems the cuts left by each brand
of blade are nearly identical.</i>

363
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,874
<i>We'd have to have the suspect
blade to compare it.</i>

364
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,573
<i>Even then, it could take weeks.</i>

365
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,718
- Thanks, Doc.
- I'm sorry, buddy.

366
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:34,257
Let me guess...

367
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,586
- another dead end, right?
- I'll keep working on it.

368
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:40,389
I hope this working on it has nothing
to do with your visions.

369
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:44,295
How did you find Emily's remains,
anwyay?

370
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,300
- I've got my sources, Captain.
- Your sources.

371
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:52,669
The press has its vultures planted
here leaking information.

372
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:56,073
Your sources had better be
air fucking tight.

373
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,146
Since when do you not
trust me, Captain?

374
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,283
Oh, I trust the real Nick.

375
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,977
It's this drugged-up deluded Nick
that I've got questions about.

376
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,350
You're gonna take that
shrink's word over mine?

377
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:09,231
Oh, come on, Nick. Nobody's
put you on leave, right?

378
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:17,540
Look, Nick... word is you're
losing it, man.

379
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,266
Captain,
I'm in this guy's head.

380
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,704
I don't know why...

381
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:27,707
I don't know how,
but I'm there.

382
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,648
I just need a bit more time.

383
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,920
That's something
we're running out of.

384
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,992
<i>The number is not in service
and there is no new number.</i>

385
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,793
<i>Please check the telephone directory
for the right number.</i>

386
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,369
<i>This is a recording.</i>

387
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,679
<i>When a person dies
before their time...</i>

388
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,414
<i>especially an unjust dead...</i>

389
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:53,386
<i>their spirit remains earthbound until
they can find peace and move on.</i>

390
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,629
<i>That's what's happening here.</i>

391
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,198
<i>I need your help.</i>

392
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:08,928
<i>Did you see or hear anything else
at all in your visions.</i>

393
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,937
<i>He goes by many names.</i>

394
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:14,145
<i>But several women in my visions
have called him Teddy.</i>

395
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:23,181
Search for Dr. Ted or Teddy,
with malpractice suits...

396
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,651
or had his license revoked
in the last five years.

397
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,654
Okay, got it.

398
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:29,053
Hold on.

399
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:32,456
But what makes you so sure
this guy's a doctor?

400
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,267
Just call it a hunch.

401
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:41,071
Detective Ferguson, right?

402
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:43,000
Thank you for your time,
Dr. Nichols.

403
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,173
What's this about?

404
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:48,584
- About a malpractice suit...
- That's been settled.

405
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,273
It's been years,
Detective Ferguson.

406
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,076
Why bring up ancient history?

407
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:58,778
Yeah. It has been years,
hasn't it?

408
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:02,823
But a patient of yours had a kidney
removed without permission.

409
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,425
She lived...

410
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,926
and I no longer assume
any medical capacity.

411
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:10,293
Aren't you the head doctor here
at the Sunshine facility?

412
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:14,676
I'm the head administrator. I make
no medical decisions here.

413
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:20,036
- Your patients thank you, Doctor.
- We're done here.

414
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,281
Any further discussion will be with
my attorney present. Understand?

415
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,476
Hey! What are you doing?

416
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,550
Get your God damn hands off me!

417
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,154
- Say it again to my face.
- You're crazy!

418
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,500
You may well just be right.

419
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,537
Thanks for your time.

420
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,235
Dee, Dee, Dee, don't sweat it.

421
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:57,676
Look, this Kennison guy never
returned any of my calls.

422
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:00,316
I'm checking out his address.

423
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:02,519
It's 5609 Soto Street.

424
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,488
If you don't hear from me soon,
send some backup.

425
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,068
We meet again.

426
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:10,045
No heart this time.

427
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,956
I'm gonna finish it this time.

428
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,499
Stay right where you are.

429
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:41,037
What's that smell?

430
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,114
Did you smell that?

431
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,240
So what's it gonna be?
It's your call.

432
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:51,904
You want me that bad, you're gonna
have to blow us both to Hell.

433
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:54,049
Can you take that shot?

434
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:58,112
Come on.

435
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,813
Show me what you got.

436
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,526
Show me.

437
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:06,792
Boom.

438
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:09,090
Don't you fucking test me,
asshole.

439
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:11,995
You already failed that test
ten years ago, detective.

440
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:17,265
Remember, it was like this. That
guy held a gun to your wife's temple...

441
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:20,170
but you were too chickenshit
to take the shot.

442
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:21,640
You remember that, detective?

443
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,984
Don't you fucking test me,
asshole!

444
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,778
You wanted to see me,
Captain?

445
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:00,890
So, what did the doctor say?

446
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,948
Couple scrapes.
A few stitches.

447
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,885
Patched me up pretty good.

448
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,559
I can still use the arm.

449
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,659
Is that it?

450
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:17,425
- Looks like you read the report.
- Yeah, fuckin' a I read the report.

451
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,602
You lost him again.

452
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:22,464
Tell me something I don't know.

453
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:25,175
Jesus Christ, Ferguson,
that's twice now.

454
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,178
Have you seen the news?

455
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,142
Matter of fact,
I haven't found the time.

456
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,555
Well I'm beginning
to feel the heat.

457
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:37,915
We all got problems, Captain.

458
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:41,147
All right, listen to me.

459
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,986
If someone's gotta
get fucked here...

460
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:47,186
I'm gonna be the one
doing the fucking, okay?

461
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:49,490
The chief is crawling up
my ass, Nick.

462
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:54,068
The man wants to launch an
investigation into this department.

463
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,500
- So let him.
- Let him?

464
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,607
Since when did you give a shit about
these ass-kissing politicians?

465
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:01,709
I have a family, Nick.

466
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,879
I've got two twins about
ready to go to college...

467
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,707
and I've got two other
mouths to feed.

468
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,622
This shit's gotta
work out for me.

469
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,518
Let's stop dicking around
here then, shall we?

470
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:14,154
Ferguson!

471
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:16,698
Sit down.

472
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,929
How many times have
I bailed you down, Nick?

473
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,700
Don't think I don't
appreciate it, Captain.

474
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:35,935
After Jessica was murdered...

475
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:39,946
you tried to drink your way to the
bottom of every bottle you could find.

476
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:42,744
After your brutal
arresting sprees...

477
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:46,047
where you seemed to blame every
perp for killing Jessica.

478
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:49,817
I arrested and convicted more
perps in this department.

479
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,893
At what cost, Nick?

480
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:56,999
I had to pick up the pieces after
you knocked that kid's teeth out.

481
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,498
You didn't knock
that kid's teeth out.

482
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:03,775
What you did was perform medieval
denistry on him for petty theft!

483
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,969
- I ought to take you off this case.
- Excuse me?

484
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,613
I can't take the fall
for you anymore.

485
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,824
Have I ever let you down?

486
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,992
Then just give me another shot!

487
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,459
Not this time, Nick

488
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:28,029
- I found the fucking guy!
- And you fucking lost him!

489
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:30,256
Again!

490
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:34,768
Fine. Then I'll go it alone.
Nobody above you needs to know.

491
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,246
Ferguson!
We're not finished yet.

492
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,218
I need your badge, Nick.

493
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:54,264
I've been ordered to
suspend you.

494
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,326
Your badge, Nick.

495
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,670
Aren't you forgetting
something?

496
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,310
How long?

497
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,820
Until you stop trying to
avenge Jessica's death.

498
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,965
Go on home, son. Heal up.

499
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:35,628
Let it go.

500
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:05,655
Jesus, Kathryn.

501
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,053
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

502
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,628
I'm sorry.
I thought I'd surprise you.

503
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,104
Yeah, well, you did.

504
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:22,310
- How'd you get it?
- The door was open.

505
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:26,138
How're you feeling?

506
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,385
We need to talk.

507
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:38,448
I've been suspended.

508
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,555
I'm on my own now.

509
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:43,260
I'm here for you.

510
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,794
Did I say something wrong?

511
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:56,137
No, no. My wife, she had a lot of
similar qualities to you.

512
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,535
Those we love never die.

513
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:02,473
She's still with you, Nick.
Never left.

514
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:06,047
I'm sure she believed in you
like I believe in you.

515
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,614
Yeah.

516
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,546
I couldn't protect those girls.

517
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:11,777
I couldn't protect her.

518
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,389
Don't lose your faith.

519
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:17,924
Once that's gone, you'll lose
yourself in the process.

520
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,401
You even sound like a shrink.

521
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:26,507
Therapy's not a bad thing,
Nick.

522
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,238
Who are you? Really.

523
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,775
Where'd you come from?

524
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,949
Fate led me to you.

525
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:45,456
Just out of curiosity, and I hope
you don't mind me asking this...

526
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,121
but why are you putting
so much faith in me?

527
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,965
You can't turn your back on
this case, Nick.

528
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,365
Why not?

529
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,799
The voices will intensify
and drive you insane.

530
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,563
You can't escape them.

531
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:07,835
They'll eat at you every day and
destroy everything that you are.

532
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,911
You really think you know
who I am, don't you?

533
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:15,119
If you don't finish this,
they'll never leave you alone.

534
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:34,266
- Jesus, Nick! It's me!
- Shit!

535
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,655
I think I shit my pants.

536
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,181
Too close, Youngblood.

537
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:52,719
- Where the fuck's your car?
- I took the bus.

538
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,015
Those morons from the lab
they see me with you?

539
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:57,898
This partnership comes to
an unhappy close.

540
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:01,096
All right,
what'd you bring me?

541
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:13,338
You didn't have enough DNA on
the manakins to run a full test.

542
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:18,777
Those morons investigate the crime
scene. They're idiots.

543
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:21,712
Then I go in and
I get the real evidence.

544
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:24,580
- How'd you do that?
- I've got my methods.

545
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,222
You don't think I've learned
a few things from you?

546
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,481
The old Nick, maybe.

547
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:30,295
The old Nick? Maybe you need
to snap out of it.

548
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:35,935
Twenty matches?

549
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,665
You're saying he has at least
twenty different victims.

550
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:45,941
That's just the tip of the iceberg.
He's been doing it for years.

551
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,780
Who knows how many?

552
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:53,880
Mabel Kennison. Is that?

553
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,381
Teddy's mother.

554
00:54:56,393 --> 00:54:59,385
Her death certificate
and accompanying report.

555
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:02,024
And I haven't even told you
the sickest shit yet.

556
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:04,921
The head is Mabel's, too.

557
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,788
You're fucking kidding me.

558
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,431
No, read it. It's all there.

559
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,794
It says here she died
of natural causes.

560
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:15,733
She was buried, body intact,
favorite wool suit...

561
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:17,497
gold necklace.

562
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:21,575
- Pretty standard burial. So what?
- So what?

563
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:23,848
- Can I have some of that?
- Yeah.

564
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:30,617
So...

565
00:55:30,627 --> 00:55:33,084
he goes to his mother's grave
the night she's buried...

566
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:36,623
'cause the head would decay
if he didn't get it in time...

567
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,487
digs up her body,
opens the coffin...

568
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:41,561
and cuts off her fuckin' head.
Then takes it...

569
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:43,357
And puts it in formaldehyde
to preserve it.

570
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:44,772
Exactly.

571
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:47,966
Fuck me.

572
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:49,638
Me too.

573
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:55,309
So, you get the pattern,
Slick?

574
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:59,514
This guy's not too nice to
the people in his circle.

575
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,390
You need to watch your back.

576
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,748
- Thanks for meeting me here.
- Meeting?

577
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:08,526
What meeting?

578
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,365
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

579
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:24,109
What are you doing?

580
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,471
Shit.

581
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:33,375
Shit.

582
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:37,689
Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!

583
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:39,538
Surprise!

584
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:47,009
Don't you like a good surprise
party, detective?

585
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:52,544
You been looking for me,
detective.

586
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:55,342
Well, here I am.

587
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:57,622
Go ahead! Do it!

588
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:03,655
I'm gonna do it, detective, but
we're gonna have some fun first.

589
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:08,603
- Fuck you!
- Not that kind of fun, detective.

590
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,605
I've got a little
surprise for you.

591
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:16,634
You stay right there, okay.

592
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:19,809
We're gonna have us
a slumber party!

593
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,252
Goodnight, sweet prince.

594
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,701
This is gonna be fun.

595
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:50,142
Real fun.

596
01:00:59,022 --> 01:01:00,819
Save the children...

597
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:04,292
save the children...

598
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,190
it's okay.

599
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:15,556
We're going to save the children.
This is a good thing.

600
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:18,233
We're gonna save the children.

601
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:21,404
Let's wake our guest up,
shall we?

602
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,905
Hello?

603
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:28,076
Hello, wakey.

604
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,938
Wakey, wakey.

605
01:01:29,952 --> 01:01:32,352
Wakey wakey wakey wakey wakey.

606
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:36,117
Hey, good morning to ya.

607
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:40,459
Hello, there.

608
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,392
Look here, you do this,
and I'll fucking...

609
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:51,860
No, I don't think so. No!

610
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:55,093
What am I thinking?
I lost my head.

611
01:01:55,111 --> 01:02:01,471
We, Wendy, have to be on our best
behavior. Remember that.

612
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:07,081
- You sick son of a bitch.
- We have to have good manners.

613
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,079
You're not gonna
get away with this!

614
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,514
You don't think so?

615
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,917
I beg to differ.

616
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:17,354
I'll prove it to ya.

617
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:19,926
I'm sorry Wendy...

618
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:22,587
but...

619
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:25,699
we have to prove a point, here.

620
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:35,273
Are you watching this?

621
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:58,631
You know, without teeth,
they can't identify the body.

622
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:05,340
Do one more? Okay.

623
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,316
Look at this.

624
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,035
Oh, yeah.

625
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:13,715
Yeah, we'll get
the rest of 'em later.

626
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:16,510
What, didn't your mother
pay enough attention?

627
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:19,017
My mother?

628
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:22,418
You don't bring my mother
into this.

629
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:28,358
You leave my mother out of this.
Leave my mother alone.

630
01:03:28,371 --> 01:03:31,534
You hear that?
My mother loved me!

631
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:36,171
My mother loved me!
She loved me!

632
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:42,175
- So now you're playing God?
- No. Not God.

633
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:48,146
Maybe the son of God.
Aren't we all sons of God?

634
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,321
The work we're doing here.

635
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:59,791
We will save millions and millions
of lives all over the world.

636
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,554
All over the world.

637
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:06,429
She's doing her part.
I'm doing mine.

638
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:11,004
What are you going to contribute?
A kidney, maybe?

639
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:15,507
- No! Fuck!
- What? Look at that.

640
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:19,045
- Mother fucker!
- That's it. Perfection.

641
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:22,877
You know that child that needs
a kidney in Africa?

642
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:27,261
Well, I am a god to her.
I am a god to her.

643
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:38,940
There we go. And God said
let there be light.

644
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:47,599
Look at that. That's beautiful.
It's all working. Such wholeness.

645
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:55,513
You can cut a liver up four or five
times and save five children.

646
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:57,617
You can do that.
Did you know that?

647
01:04:57,627 --> 01:05:07,400
With one liver from one slut you
can save five children in Africa.

648
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:16,060
I got some major shit brewin'.
I'm talkin' some good shit.

649
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,136
Shoot.

650
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:22,004
I just received a phone call from
a doctor who worked with Teddy Kennison.

651
01:05:22,018 --> 01:05:27,809
The two met at med school, and he
knows the guy like the back of his hand.

652
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,381
And?

653
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:32,145
I'm meeting up with him to get
the lowdown on this guy.

654
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:33,583
All right, keep me informed.

655
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:36,224
Absolutely, Captain.
You got it.

656
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:38,587
- Hey, hey, Dee?
- Yeah?

657
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,057
You talk to Nick today?

658
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:43,470
Nah, I haven't heard from him.
Why? Is everything cool.

659
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:47,699
Yeah, yeah,
it's probably nothing.

660
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:53,606
I just had a conversation with
one of your colleagues.

661
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,050
He's gonna pay us
a visit shortly.

662
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,948
Who is it?

663
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:05,087
You'll know soon enough. I'll make
sure he stops by to say hello.

664
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:12,021
And in case you're wondering,
detective.

665
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:19,896
I'm gonna remove the rest of
her teeth after the acid bath.

666
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:23,345
It's just a matter of time, Teddy.
You know that, right?

667
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:27,407
They're closing in as we speak.

668
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:33,446
Good, although by the time they get
here there won't be anything left.

669
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:37,085
I hear arson is a bad problem
in this neighborhood.

670
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:41,751
And sadly, that's what
we're gonna have to do.

671
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:44,358
Burn it all to the ground.

672
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:47,733
What a waste.

673
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:52,568
You know, detective...

674
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:55,430
you and me have a lot
in common.

675
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:59,164
Although you chase the bad guys
and I run from the cops...

676
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:03,470
it's all about the details,
isn't it? Attention to detail.

677
01:07:03,486 --> 01:07:07,206
That's bullshit and you know it.
We're nothing alike at all.

678
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:09,088
I'm sorry you feel that way.

679
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:13,488
Details.

680
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,833
We'll chat later.

681
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:38,249
Remember, I'm expecting
a guest later.

682
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:07,612
Doctor Clark?
Detective Danielson.

683
01:08:11,554 --> 01:08:13,351
Dr. Clark.

684
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:29,397
Hello?

685
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:32,707
Dr. Clark?

686
01:08:45,988 --> 01:08:47,853
Nick! What the fuck, man?

687
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,390
I've got you!

688
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,339
You're next.

689
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:31,160
This is it. This is the moment
you've been waiting for.

690
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:42,262
It's useless.

691
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:49,878
Relax yourself, my boy. Somebody's
gonna get that heart of yours.

692
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:55,983
Someone's gonna get
that heart of years.

693
01:09:57,326 --> 01:10:01,547
Wait a minute. That's not even
your heart, is it?

694
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:03,520
You can go fuck yourself.

695
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:07,628
I'll remember you said that while I
watch you draw your last breath.

696
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,948
Stay the fuck where you are.

697
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:55,402
Captain, it's Nick.

698
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:01,206
Yeah, I got him.

699
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:03,207
1199.

700
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:07,788
Yeah, everyone.

701
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:13,992
1030 Vignes Street.

702
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:44,677
This guy
was no ordinary madman.

703
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:46,320
Tell me something
I don't know.

704
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:48,592
He was one sick fuck.

705
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:53,993
We found the lab computer,
which Teddy kept clean.

706
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:58,189
Then we found the laptop buried in
one of those store rooms.

707
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,799
What was on it?

708
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:06,740
Some guys like to do their Jack
the Ripper impersonation.

709
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:09,138
Not our guy.

710
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:12,450
He was a key member of
an organ theft conspiracy.

711
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:20,153
He would sell the organs to hospitals
in the region and all of the world.

712
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:23,025
Teddy...

713
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:26,255
clearly OCD...

714
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:29,988
kept detailed records
all in code.

715
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:34,260
He would track whose organs they
took and where they would go.

716
01:13:34,276 --> 01:13:40,499
Once we cracked the code, we matched
the records with missing persons.

717
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:46,284
Emily Boxer, Wendy Simmons,
Kathryn Rose.

718
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,821
What is it, Slick?

719
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:58,360
I know. It's tough to see
that many faces, isn't it?

720
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:01,460
This can't be.

721
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,199
What?

722
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:05,764
You know her?

723
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:16,202
- You sure about her?
- Yeah.

724
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:18,311
Dental records were a match.

725
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:36,695
How did you know this
Kathryn Girl, anwyay?

726
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:42,337
I just do. Did.

727
01:14:42,344 --> 01:14:45,074
Well, it's funny.

728
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:51,276
'Cause we were able to trace some of
her organs back to general.

729
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:54,915
They type-matched her DNA with
a heart donated by a Jane Doe...

730
01:14:54,923 --> 01:14:59,815
on October 31, last year.

731
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,784
That's Halloween.

732
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:03,765
Jesus, that's rich.

733
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:08,260
What day?

734
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,465
October 31.

735
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:18,244
You were admitted
the same day...

736
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:24,547
and you had
the same blood type.

737
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:31,483
You...
you have her heart.

738
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:38,592
Jesus...
what are the odds of that?

739
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,467
Vegas, baby.
All the way.

740
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:50,433
So, just how far does
this conspiracy go?

741
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:53,266
Not sure yet. Teddy's discs
led straight to the buyer...

742
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:56,001
and he's singing like a canary.

743
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:59,169
That bitch-ass mother fucker's lucky
I'm not in front of him.

744
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:01,678
Yeah, well.

745
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,045
He named three hospitals
as his primary customers.

746
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:07,517
Busy trying to match names with
any records they may have on file.

747
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:10,918
You know I talked to the chief.

748
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:15,222
That silly-ass son of a bitch
is fucking ecstatic.

749
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,955
You know what, Captain?
You got a filthy mouth.

750
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:19,327
I'm working on a recommendation
for you, don't you?

751
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:22,526
What for? Being mauled twice
or being suspended?

752
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:25,263
That's all water under
the bridge Ferguson.

753
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,498
You got our man, right?

754
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:30,405
I don't know how you did it and
I really don't give a shit.

755
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,080
You got our man.

756
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:35,750
Here is to
Lieutenant Nicholas Ferguson.

757
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:42,318
I insisted on your promotion.

758
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:45,323
You're going to be heading up a
newly-formed investigative unit.

759
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:47,393
And I've been thinking
that maybe you...

760
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,498
Nick?

761
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:57,872
What's on your mind,
buddy?

762
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,752
I can't do this anymore,
Captain.

763
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,376
I'm outta here.

764
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,293
I'm resigning my commission.

765
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:19,425
Effective when?

766
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:22,736
Effective immediately.

767
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:34,836
You know, this is all you know,
Nick.

768
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:37,182
What the Hell you think
you're gonna do now?

769
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:41,007
I don't know.

770
