1 
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,700 
The legendary number 1 headband. 

2 
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:46,301 
It promises to power, kaikkivoipaisuutta, 
immortality. 

3 
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:49,302 
But the price is high. 

4 
00:00:49,703 --> 00:00:53,503 
Greater than anyone can imagine. 

5 
00:00:54,104 --> 00:00:57,104 
And heavier than the man 
will be able to withstand. 

6 
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:22,065 
Headbands Nauha will be ... 

7 
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:25,766 
... ours. 

8 
00:02:57,869 --> 00:03:00,143 
Touche! 

9 
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:35,571 
... bastard. 

10 
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,304 
Son. 

11 
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:38,579 
Father. 

12 
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:43,580 
Father. 

13 
00:04:58,308 --> 00:04:59,981 
Afro. 

14 
00:06:45,814 --> 00:06:47,476 
Jinno? 

15 
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:51,287 
Do you remember me? 

16 
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:56,288 
I will remember you and 
all of your actions. 

17 
00:07:56,989 --> 00:08:00,089 
The killer, a monster. 

18 
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,990 
How many hundreds of life 
you've chosen? 

19 
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:09,591 
How many thousands have been 
rakkaimpiaan miss. 

20 
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:12,392 
Now it's your turn. 

21 
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,993 
I know the only thing that you care. 

22 
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:20,494 
And when you raise him up to life; 
he becomes a toy. 

23 
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:23,495 
Kidutan him. 

24 
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,896 
Your father is suffering from penalty, 
your sins. 

25 
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:43,397 
Afro Samurai. 

26 
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:49,598 
If you do not find the number 2 headband tape 
and try to stop me. 

27 
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:52,699 
Can we find your eggs in it? 

28 
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:59,100 
So the area to search for the boy. 

29 
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:17,287 
Come to see Afro Samurai. 

30 
00:09:17,788 --> 00:09:24,588 
Number 1 headband otsallani, 
you are bound by rules of samurai. 

31 
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:28,169 
Swallow the bait to look for the number 2 

32 
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,670 
Come to me, -- 

33 
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,271 
so I can destroy your heart and body. 

34 
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:37,472 
As the destroyed mine. 

35 
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:08,780 
You look quite karsealta. 

36 
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:13,281 
How is it gone? 
Not to be seen in recent times. 

37 
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:19,282 
You are apparently outdated. 

38 
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:24,283 
Look at this pathetic blade 
lovilla far. 

39 
00:10:24,484 --> 00:10:27,484 
Things did not really have shifted. 

40 
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:34,485 
Why you do not like the headbands nro.1 tape? 

41 
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:37,686 
I got a punishment. 

42 
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:40,387 
Have you not learned anything? 

43 
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:44,988 
Was the fault of the problem, but 
pidettyäsi headband tape -- 

44 
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:47,389 
you can not quit. 

45 
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,290 
On the other. How Teddy Bear man 
is still alive? 

46 
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:53,591 
Did not you kill him yet? 

47 
00:10:53,692 --> 00:11:00,492 
You 've since he made his return and 
kicked persustas black. 

48 
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:04,193 
What about the baby, who was 
accompanied him. 

49 
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:06,694 
He has a new nro.1. 

50 
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:09,895 
Damn, what ryntäät was. 

51 
00:11:10,396 --> 00:11:13,096 
And takalisto was phenomenal. 

52 
00:11:13,397 --> 00:11:17,397 
Even in a cold fury 
got me hot. 

53 
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:31,898 
- It will start again. 
- Great! 

54 
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:36,899 
Homma my taste. 
The road is being turned on again. 

55 
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:53,700 
Have these pieces certainly enough? 

56 
00:11:55,701 --> 00:12:01,101 
I can assure you that within 2 weeks 
inside are witnessing a miracle. 

57 
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:02,802 
Sio. 

58 
00:12:03,203 --> 00:12:08,803 
I feel gratitude for helping 
My research work. 

59 
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:12,404 
The perfect creature is finished, -- 

60 
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:16,805 
we are striving for a self - 
God's strength. 

61 
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:20,306 
The world is in our hand's reach. 

62 
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:31,607 
I will finish what we use 
this miracle, professor. 

63 
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,708 
And it is you who will help us. 

64 
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:38,309 
Do not forget that. 

65 
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,710 
Apologize to your Excellency, 
šio damsel. 

66 
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:48,711 
Interest only met 
this perfectly. 

67 
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:54,612 
I declare that I use all its resources 
advantage of you, -- 

68 
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:58,813 
beautiful and precious šio mistress. 

69 
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:01,814 
The wise solution kannaltasi. 

70 
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:09,815 
Preparation for construction has been completed. 

71 
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:18,216 
Te three. Watch Afroa, and hold 
I was informed of his movements. 

72 
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:20,217 
Understood. 

73 
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:29,318 
The time has finally come. 

74 
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:32,919 
All preparations have been made. 

75 
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,120 
Kostoomme Afro Samurai for. 

76 
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:57,121 
You look a little pirteämmältä, even though 
huuhtonutkaan sour your face off. 

77 
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:03,122 
Your father remnants theft 
the center of the storm. 

78 
00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:09,723 
It is scary. 
Mädäntymisjuttuja and more. 

79 
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,524 
Who semmoista really do? 
But I understand tekojasi. 

80 
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:17,225 
Suutuit so much, to leave 
On the road again. 

81 
00:14:17,426 --> 00:14:24,026 
To find again No.2 headband tape 
so that you can fight back against nro.1. 

82 
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:35,527 
- All just to get your father's skull. 
- There is no alternative. 

83 
00:14:35,928 --> 00:14:38,528 
My dad must have a rest in peace. 

84 
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:56,030 
Only in the blade is clean now. End 
it's your job. 

85 
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,031 
Afro on the move. 

86 
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:15,032 
Keep up the vigilance. 

87 
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:19,833 
We are not obliged to do this. 

88 
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:22,534 
You should just take it easy. 

89 
00:15:22,635 --> 00:15:26,035 
Changes the state of mind, to go huorissa 
or something. 

90 
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:30,836 
Wait a minute! 

91 
00:15:31,037 --> 00:15:37,437 
This is the first time that 
when I see you without No.2 headband tape. 

92 
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:41,438 
And you know what? You look 
very strange. 

93 
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,839 
I knew something was wrong. 

94 
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,340 
Otsasi is huge. 

95 
00:15:48,341 --> 00:15:51,241 
I thought your hair a vast, 
but blimey! 

96 
00:15:51,442 --> 00:15:54,342 
Otsasi is many times 
outsized. 

97 
00:15:54,343 --> 00:16:00,043 
You mean when he said the principal, 
Prime Minister, the shrew. 

98 
00:16:00,244 --> 00:16:01,744 
Shut up. 

99 
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:06,445 
Where should we go? 

100 
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,646 
Is that true? He 
is coming here? 

101 
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:24,947 
He is it. Eyes and hair 
can not get it wrong. 

102 
00:16:25,148 --> 00:16:29,448 
Cursed creature who silpoi Sumin. 

103 
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:32,949 
Demon that killed their loved ones. 

104 
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,550 
We do not get this chance to go. 
Revenge is ours. 

105 
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:43,051 
He is coming! 
Afro Samurai is coming! 

106 
00:16:51,252 --> 00:16:54,452 
Hey Afro. 
You might need this. 

107 
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,453 
You murdered my father. 

108 
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,854 
- You murdered him! 
- You killed the only brother! 

109 
00:17:13,055 --> 00:17:17,355 
- And the best of my friend! 
- Revenge imprisonment. 

110 
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:47,156 
Be damned demon. 

111 
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:52,657 
Cuts in hell. Hukut innocent 
the blood, which you are slaughtered. 

112 
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:59,158 
We suffer from miekkojen attacks 
even after death. 

113 
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,459 
Curse wear, Afro Samurai. 

114 
00:18:20,644 --> 00:18:24,005 
Goddamn it. Now begins 
look good. 

115 
00:18:24,506 --> 00:18:26,506 
To have a little skin. 

116 
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:55,507 
Afro Samurai is here. 

117 
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:58,508 
Send him up. 

118 
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,809 
The plan is as follows, 
You do something -- 

119 
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,510 
I get lap dances, and 
we meet at 5 minutes' time. 

120 
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:09,511 
And then you went. 

121 
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,812 
Greetings. 

122 
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,813 
No.2 headband. 

123 
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:50,914 
Unfortunately, I can not give it 
location, therefore, free of charge. 

124 
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:53,915 
But if you win me. 

125 
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:58,516 
No, no, no ... not a sword. 

126 
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:01,517 
We play in these. 

127 
00:20:02,518 --> 00:20:06,318 
If you win, I tell what is No.2. 

128 
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:10,619 
If I win, I get reached. 

129 
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,620 
Is that agreed? 

130 
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:18,421 
Guide to the Afro Mr gaming area. 

131 
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:31,922 
Contrary to what you brother Wong, I play 
Only if you know win. 

132 
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:40,723 
It was fantastic! 

133 
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,324 
I got 2 for one price of dance. 

134 
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:47,725 
I was ... Hey, where not only property? 

135 
00:20:51,265 --> 00:20:53,726 
We play gambling games. 
Awesome. 

136 
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,727 
Place the game got under way. 

137 
00:20:57,528 --> 00:21:00,928 
Play the black. 
Oh, right the wrong game. 

138 
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:07,929 
Which one? 

139 
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,930 
Odd. 

140 
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:14,431 
Even. 

141 
00:21:16,935 --> 00:21:19,132 
Two ykköstä, even. 

142 
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:21,333 
Afro Samurai. 

143 
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:25,034 
Now, when you lose a little more than a game, -- 

144 
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:27,835 
I ask you to fill ... 

145 
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:34,436 
Fair? 

146 
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,637 
Huijaava huoranpenikka. Free 
lap dances for the good. 

147 
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:47,238 
No.2 headband? 

148 
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,139 
No.2 is ownerless Samurai 
Shichigoro named. 

149 
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,340 
He is the west, the village 
Machi named City. 

150 
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:03,941 
Is not oltaisi could be Tovi 
longer gambling site. 

151 
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:08,142 
This shit is boring, 
and you, too. 

152 
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:25,143 
In fact, vengeance demon, 
God is looking for guidance from. 

153 
00:22:27,444 --> 00:22:30,544 
You think you cleaned sins, -- 

154 
00:22:30,945 --> 00:22:33,945 
carving silly toys. 

155 
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,246 
This does not tell every day. 

156 
00:22:38,947 --> 00:22:42,147 
Where is the cold-blooded killer, 
Every time you were? 

157 
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:46,148 
Do you not stand up to fight anymore? 

158 
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:51,049 
Keep a coward, 
even if your father is suffering from? 

159 
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,550 
That was not nice. 
Does that shit to listen to? 

160 
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:59,551 
And you are so long 
travel ahead. 

161 
00:23:00,152 --> 00:23:03,552 
Save your father tortured. 

162 
00:23:03,753 --> 00:23:06,153 
I have raised almost 
her life. 

163 
00:23:06,354 --> 00:23:08,254 
He comes to life again. 

164 
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:12,055 
Know their pain, 
kärsiäkseen. 

165 
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:16,056 
And you do not even have 
No.2 headband tape yet. 

166 
00:23:17,157 --> 00:23:20,957 
So, I have a few

167 
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:27,158 
when your father to enjoy the pain, before 
you have the right to sue me. 

168 
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:31,559 
Beware puheitasi. 

169 
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:38,960 
Since I am coming. 

170 
00:24:00,628 --> 00:24:03,261 
We will, yes, bitch. 

171 
00:24:05,162 --> 00:24:09,462 
You are worse than the anger, love. 

172 
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:12,163 
Now begins care less. 

173 
00:24:14,764 --> 00:24:17,164 
Not likely to understand who 
with kidding. 

174 
00:24:27,942 --> 00:24:29,465 
Jinno. 

175 
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:34,766 
At last he makes a move. All 
goes according to plan. 

176 
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:36,767 
We get kostomme. 

177 
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:42,768 
To succeed, my beloved, we are 
demoneiksi change. 

178 
00:24:44,469 --> 00:24:45,969 
I'm sorry -- 

179 
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:51,470 
but it is the only way to get 
he was always feeling for surullisuutta -- 

180 
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:53,571 
which we have known. 

181 
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:58,472 
To get him to suffer, such as 
we have suffered. 

182 
00:24:59,473 --> 00:25:03,173 
So, please, and 
Forgive me. 

183 
00:25:04,174 --> 00:25:09,074 
Keep in mind that there was no alternative. 

184 
00:25:11,288 --> 00:25:13,875 
I will always love you. 

185 
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:17,876 
My dear brother. 

186 
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,077 
Your luck sucks. 

187 
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:45,578 
Everyone knows that here is a ravet 
underway at this time. 

188 
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:49,779 
You may not, those who are celebrating 
No.2 information otsanauhasta. 

189 
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,080 
His name was Shichigoro? 

190 
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:55,381 
You know, even what he looks like, 
because I did not. 

191 
00:25:55,582 --> 00:25:58,782 
How do we know that it is even 
is his real name? 

192 
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:09,783 
Help! 
Help! 

193 
00:26:12,784 --> 00:26:14,384 
Get out of my way! 

194 
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:18,485 
Daylight kidnapping. 
I hate to do the job. 

195 
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:23,186 
Oh, shit. 
Afro Samurai. 

196 
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:27,887 
Get out of the way! 

197 
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:30,088 
I told you to move! 

198 
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,389 
Afro-gun, the gun! 
Decent gun yet. 

199 
00:27:02,385 --> 00:27:04,090 
Kitaro! 

200 
00:27:12,728 --> 00:27:14,391 
Father. 

201 
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:23,292 
Kitaro, advice 
to remain in the vicinity. 

202 
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:25,793 
I'm sorry. 

203 
00:27:29,612 --> 00:27:31,994 
For my gratitude. 

204 
00:27:32,795 --> 00:27:35,395 
This coward kidnapped son ... 

205 
00:27:36,796 --> 00:27:38,396 
Anti be. 

206 
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:46,497 
I offer you a drink. 
I know the place likeltä. 

207 
00:27:54,123 --> 00:27:58,598 
I would lose ninjakenkäni. 
Wait, hukun here! 

208 
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:02,799 
Do not dismiss the brothers! 

209 
00:28:57,075 --> 00:28:59,193 
I came back, old man. 

210 
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:06,715 
- You brought your friend with you. 
- He saved my life Kitaro. 

211 
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:12,016 
So it seems strong enough, 
not dying muhennokseesi. 

212 
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:19,017 
Speak with caution ruuistani Shichigoro, 
or you find a hot pepper on your bowl. 

213 
00:29:20,018 --> 00:29:23,218 
I came back! 
Nuuskin tieni unto. 

214 
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,219 
You seem to murkinaa. 

215 
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520 
Something smells vängälle. 

216 
00:29:29,921 --> 00:29:32,521 
Damn, that is the target. 

217 
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:36,322 
What should be the guy? 

218 
00:29:37,623 --> 00:29:40,323 
- Sukiyaki. 
- Put double. 

219 
00:30:02,152 --> 00:30:03,824 
Here you. 

220 
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:09,125 
You are not drinking men. You do not know 
where not only the ice. 

221 
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:11,426 
Limpparia ago? 

222 
00:30:14,627 --> 00:30:16,227 
As long as joking. 

223 
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:18,828 
You don 't be because of the festival here. 

224 
00:30:19,629 --> 00:30:23,029 
Me neither. I am 
passing through. 

225 
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:28,030 
But we linger too long. 

226 
00:30:29,731 --> 00:30:32,131 
We saw the fun festival. 

227 
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:35,332 
But it seems best to go forward. 

228 
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:43,033 
The evil thing that you need 
to kill him. 

229 
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:46,334 
He seems 
really good guy. 

230 
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:49,535 
It is always one of them after the festival. 

231 
00:30:51,036 --> 00:30:54,936 
At the very least, do not need to eat 
toxins since then. 

232 
00:30:57,275 --> 00:31:00,337 
Teen best muhennosta 
miles radius. 

233 
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:03,738 
When you come back, remind 
that charge you double. 

234 
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,739 
This is the best? 

235 
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,140 
It should also kill it 
Martha Stewart liar. 

236 
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:14,341 
This stew stinks. 

237 
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,842 
Limpparia. 
Drink out of time. 

238 
00:31:29,802 --> 00:31:33,243 
The man before. The fact that 
paloittelit. 

239 
00:31:33,944 --> 00:31:37,044 
- Do you know why he is kidnapped by Kitaro? 
- Not a clue. 

240 
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:41,345 
Want to know why the effort to see 
street boy, and the likes juopon why. 

241 
00:31:42,246 --> 00:31:45,346 
- Shichigoro ... 
- All very well. 

242 
00:31:45,747 --> 00:31:47,447 
Well tell us. 

243 
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:57,348 
I have something to 
all want. 

244 
00:32:12,354 --> 00:32:16,349 
First, fill his stomach, and 
Tovi only so is the dream. 

245 
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:21,950 
It is not even mine, but an orphan. 
Tapatutti father himself. 

246 
00:32:22,851 --> 00:32:26,151 
Promised to look after Kitaro; 
if he should die. 

247 
00:32:27,552 --> 00:32:30,052 
We were as brothers. 

248 
00:32:30,653 --> 00:32:33,853 
He was a man tappaneella 
reportedly had a strange appearance. 

249 
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:38,854 
Afro, a green tint 
likeltä view. 

250 
00:32:41,055 --> 00:32:43,955 
Now listen carefully. 

251 
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:49,856 
The world can be found in the blood ties deeper. 

252 
00:32:52,757 --> 00:32:54,357 
What? 

253 
00:32:54,858 --> 00:33:00,258 
It is a stupid friend had as many 
Other bands headbands suit. 

254 
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:02,859 
Nettosi only their own demise. 

255 
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,560 
Do you know what he said 
dying? 

256 
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:11,661 
"Not anymore," she whispered. 

257 
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:17,662 
Then I got No.2 headband strap themselves 
and hide it. 

258 
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,963 
And I have fled since then. 

259 
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:34,964 
But now you came from. 

260 
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:42,965 
And now we're even. 

261 
00:33:44,466 --> 00:33:47,766 
So I think all managed 
you're out below. 

262 
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,067 
Drat. 

263 
00:33:52,368 --> 00:33:56,568 
Now begins the event and 
ends sentimentality. 

264 
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:58,769 
Shichigoro. 

265 
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:04,970 
Keep the boy worry. 
Back. 

266 
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,471 
I figured that if you just stick 
Kitaro motion with -- 

267 
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:31,472 
people forget that and my friends 
your wish a reality. 

268 
00:34:32,673 --> 00:34:35,473 
But fate is not ambiguous, 
escape. 

269 
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,074 
Damn. 

270 
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:42,475 
These forehead strips make 
Only death and orphans. 

271 
00:34:43,376 --> 00:34:48,076 
Afro hear? 
Death and orphans. 

272 
00:34:49,277 --> 00:34:55,677 
I will not give you a tape of forehead, but you have to 
to kill me for it. 

273 
00:34:56,978 --> 00:35:01,978 
I do not play forehead strip rules 
or save the world. 

274 
00:35:06,753 --> 00:35:10,279 
Afro! Why official position? 

275 
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,080 
After all, he is cool, but 
none of your friends. 

276 
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:15,381 
Hoida just do the job. 

277 
00:35:21,032 --> 00:35:24,382 
Because I promise, I think. 

278 
00:36:31,452 --> 00:36:35,261 
Do not think that I feel 
you Afro Samurai. 

279 
00:36:35,462 --> 00:36:41,562 
Thus what you did to bridge. Killed without 
the slightest hesitation. 

280 
00:36:42,363 --> 00:36:45,563 
As he would have only 
pesky fly. 

281 
00:36:46,964 --> 00:36:50,264 
Maybe someone should whack you. 

282 
00:36:51,265 --> 00:36:54,265 
Perhaps I believe to be true 
get a man. 

283 
00:36:54,566 --> 00:36:58,666 
Will you let him throw the läppää. 
Diced him already! 

284 
00:37:04,649 --> 00:37:08,241 
Goodbye, Afro Samurai. 

285 
00:37:09,042 --> 00:37:12,242 
Talking crazy. Death 
Expects weirdo. 

286 
00:37:59,766 --> 00:38:02,243 
Damn. 
Äijähän part of the movement. 

287 
00:38:02,444 --> 00:38:06,344 
Impressive. He may not be able 
even kill you. 

288 
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:39,345 
Pakenetko are you? You may us 
disrepute. 

289 
00:38:52,494 --> 00:38:56,446 
I knew you spoof. 
We do not ever escape. 

290 
00:38:56,647 --> 00:38:59,347 
We do not learn it now. 

291 
00:38:59,348 --> 00:39:03,348 
Heiluttele sword so 
I virittäydyn mood. 

292 
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:05,649 
Celebrations under way! 

293 
00:39:27,194 --> 00:39:32,350 
Damn! Everybody likes rock stars. 
Lighting, lighting control. 

294 
00:40:00,621 --> 00:40:02,651 
Put the motion. 

295 
00:40:03,552 --> 00:40:06,552 
"Destroy all the Afro Samurai" 

296 
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:40,053 
Now the party is at its height. 

297 
00:40:40,254 --> 00:40:43,954 
Below is a man 
No.2 otsanauhassaan. 

298 
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:45,955 
Do not stop ... 

299 
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:16,556 
Where do these ilmeistyivät? 

300 
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,057 
Father.

301 
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,458 
Kitaro. 

302 
00:41:54,436 --> 00:41:59,459 
Killed the music. Ainako keep 
ruin the festivities. 

303 
00:42:04,865 --> 00:42:07,660 
It was an unnecessary distraction. 

304 
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:10,961 
Still want to die? 

305 
00:42:16,813 --> 00:42:22,462 
You want it around a lot. It is 
only a piece of fabric for an idiot. 

306 
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,463 
If you trust onneesi, come on 
to apply for it. 

307 
00:43:01,548 --> 00:43:03,464 
What vit ...? 

308 
00:44:03,045 --> 00:44:04,965 
Peace soul. 

309 
00:44:46,836 --> 00:44:50,166 
Every time you have to 
to suspend the fun. 

310 
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:55,267 
I was going to jorata until morning, valotikut 
and all was. 

311 
00:44:55,468 --> 00:45:01,068 
Did it spoil. Withdrew the whole 
the job and it is your fault. 

312 
00:45:01,269 --> 00:45:02,869 
And one thing yet. 

313 
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:07,470 
Do not let reaching No.2 
rise hat. 

314 
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:14,371 
Älyätkö to walk again demonien 
the trail. It is not the right direction. 

315 
00:45:19,957 --> 00:45:21,572 
Anyhow. 

316 
00:45:21,573 --> 00:45:25,873 
Where to go from here? How does it 
kuulostais tuuppailu? 

317 
00:45:26,374 --> 00:45:28,874 
We never have fun. 

318 
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:35,075 
Damn. This does not 
belonged to the plans. 

319 
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,776 
Did not those already pieksäneet you? 
Perääsi came again. 

320 
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:51,777 
Sword tuhrii the world in blood. 

321 
00:45:52,178 --> 00:45:53,878 
What then? 

322 
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,579 
Only to kill their own, 
invalid because of syittesi. 

323 
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,580 
Do you not own hearts? 

324 
00:46:24,872 --> 00:46:28,081 
It is not true. What the hell 
these people are! 

325 
00:46:28,282 --> 00:46:30,582 
That is impossible! 

326 
00:46:44,908 --> 00:46:46,983 
Do not think so either. 

327 
00:46:48,484 --> 00:46:53,584 
Hold yourself or nöyrryt 
pieksäntään another. 

328 
00:46:54,885 --> 00:46:58,385 
Do not want a new leluni rikkoutuvan? 

329 
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:01,586 
He is so fragile, yet. 

330 
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:05,787 
Go to Cherry Hill cent, or 
he will die again. 

331 
00:47:05,988 --> 00:47:11,188 
But this time, a very 
much more slowly. 

332 
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:18,189 
Keep a smaller mouth. 

333 
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,890 
Ben! 

334 
00:47:22,891 --> 00:47:25,891 
Valtiattareni, step backwards. 

335 
00:47:43,707 --> 00:47:45,392 
Damn. 

336 
00:47:45,693 --> 00:47:50,393 
- Are you okay? 
- No. 

337 
00:48:09,895 --> 00:48:11,494 
Jinno! 

338 
00:48:18,507 --> 00:48:20,895 
Easy, the little sister. 

339 
00:48:21,396 --> 00:48:25,596 
Long time šio. How 
you've been able to princess? 

340 
00:48:26,197 --> 00:48:29,797 
- Fine. 
- And what are the ottovanhempamme? 

341 
00:48:29,998 --> 00:48:33,498 
They are awesome. Just as the 
real parents. 

342 
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,999 
They have a son of Bin, a little 
harsh and frightening. 

343 
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,400 
Another boy is playing with Michael 
a lot with me. 

344 
00:48:40,801 --> 00:48:45,101 
And Miss Tomosan teach me 
have as the right princess 

345 
00:48:45,502 --> 00:48:50,102 
I learned to dance, to drink 
tea and everything else. 

346 
00:48:51,903 --> 00:48:54,103 
That 's fine. 

347 
00:48:54,504 --> 00:48:57,104 
I hope that you could be here. 

348 
00:48:57,305 --> 00:49:00,205 
I know, but you're safe here. 

349 
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:04,006 
The family wanted a daughter 
lost farm. 

350 
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:06,907 
I notice that they have accepted 
you own. 

351 
00:49:07,108 --> 00:49:11,508 
We both should be grateful. 
I try to visit more often. 

352 
00:49:14,209 --> 00:49:17,509 
I want you to meet one. 
This is Afro. 

353 
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,110 
Afro, here is my sister šio. 

354 
00:49:21,511 --> 00:49:23,211 
Afro healthy. 

355 
00:49:24,412 --> 00:49:26,612 
He is a newcomer sword in school -- 

356 
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:32,013 
but it is almost as good 
than I do, and like a brother to me. 

357 
00:49:33,414 --> 00:49:35,014 
A brother? 

358 
00:49:36,115 --> 00:49:39,815 
So it makes you 
including my brother. 

359 
00:49:40,516 --> 00:49:42,816 
Yeah, I guess? 

360 
00:49:45,417 --> 00:49:49,817 
- Cool. I just received a new brother. 
- Exactly. 

361 
00:49:50,118 --> 00:49:53,018 
Can I look at the sword to school sometimes? 

362 
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:58,019 
- Yes. Like at any time. 
- You are shy. 

363 
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,820 
And your hair is funny. 

364 
00:50:01,921 --> 00:50:04,421 
Nice to meet you'll. 

365 
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:31,347 
You will soon be free. 

366 
00:50:33,248 --> 00:50:38,548 
You can not play with the science around. 
Are you crazy? 

367 
00:50:39,049 --> 00:50:43,849 
After graduating, he may well be 
be the perfect samurai. 

368 
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:50,150 
If he is to grow, harassed, he 
can become a useless pile of protein. 

369 
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:57,951 
Crazy? A strange word madness 
kuvajaisen mouth. 

370 
00:50:58,152 --> 00:51:01,452 
But the plan would be 
unable to self-destruction. 

371 
00:51:02,353 --> 00:51:05,653 
Dear Professor, it is 
Part of the process. 

372 
00:51:06,054 --> 00:51:09,654 
The more kiusaan Afroa, 
the better. 

373 
00:51:09,855 --> 00:51:14,455 
I want her suffering 
lasting a long time. 

374 
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:20,056 
His death is not an end. It is 
only a point of GDP on. 

375 
00:51:20,357 --> 00:51:22,957 
Do you not understand me now? 

376 
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:29,958 
Of course, šio mistress. You have 
kieroitunut indeed. 

377 
00:51:30,259 --> 00:51:33,459 
But there are risks. 

378 
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:40,960 
How refreshing experience. 

379 
00:51:41,161 --> 00:51:47,961 
I do kieroitunut. World kieroin 
scientist has impressed me kieroudesta. 

380 
00:51:49,862 --> 00:51:53,062 
Do not be afraid my friend round. 

381 
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:57,463 
Everything is going very 
According to the plans. 

382 
00:51:58,364 --> 00:52:00,864 
You could count on a bit. 

383 
00:52:02,565 --> 00:52:04,865 
Yes valtiattareni. 

384 
00:52:06,366 --> 00:52:11,866 
My advice and it does not end 
failure as Kuma. 

385 
00:52:13,267 --> 00:52:18,367 
He repaired so many times that 
he is no longer people are left. 

386 
00:52:19,668 --> 00:52:22,568 
He is just misguided samurai doll. 

387 
00:52:23,469 --> 00:52:26,469 
Soulless, dead. 

388 
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:30,970 
But now, meat, bone ... 

389 
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:37,971 
... blood. Life in developing nano-technology. 
Chemically active nerve endings. 

390 
00:52:38,272 --> 00:52:43,772 
And unlawful science that it is 
alkemiaa more than biotechnology. 

391 
00:52:48,473 --> 00:52:54,773 
You are indeed the world kieroin, 
shit-faced, and a genius scientist. 

392 
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:59,374 
Cuts in hell tekosistasi 
nature. 

393 
00:52:59,975 --> 00:53:03,575 
Praise me so well, 
šio mistress. 

394 
00:53:03,876 --> 00:53:08,976 
- I am not worthy ylistyksienne. 
- You filth. 

395 
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:12,977 
History of mourning hirmutekojasi, 
that you do. 

396 
00:53:13,278 --> 00:53:16,278 
You have to burn alive. 

397 
00:53:30,634 --> 00:53:35,679 
Afro chasing me and my brother ...? 

398 
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:41,080 
When he arrives, he sees 
syntiensä sanctions. 

399 
00:53:42,081 --> 00:53:45,481 
His twice killing the only friend, the -- 

400 
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:51,282 
and my dear father, increase 
sword revenge. 

401 
00:53:53,483 --> 00:54:01,583 
And at the last moment, these hands will be 
to decide on Afro Samurai life. 

402 
00:54:05,584 --> 00:54:07,184 
Damn! 

403 
00:54:07,585 --> 00:54:10,185 
Here is hot! 

404 
00:54:11,086 --> 00:54:17,386 
Is it not a faster route to Cherry 
Hill Siin? It is certainly Sion win. 

405 
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:21,887 
And it was really weird 
a family gathering. Did not Afro? 

406 
00:54:22,388 --> 00:54:26,388 
I think most excited when 
the father is alive, but -- 

407 
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:32,389 
I do not believe in a living head, which excrete 
ällöä töhnää, the more sense. 

408 
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:36,190 
How he could be with be alive? 
Would kusettaa. 

409 
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:41,791 
Huijasivat. Maybe it was a robot, such as 
it tappamasi afro-robot once. 

410 
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:46,492 
Or maybe it was a dummy, 
liikuteltiin by hand. 

411 
00:54:48,793 --> 00:54:51,993 
Is granted, it was stupid. 
No, it was a doll. 

412 
00:54:52,494 --> 00:54:56,394 
It had any, 
One thing is for sure. 

413 
00:54:57,195 --> 00:55:00,795 
Suttura It is crazy. 

414 
00:55:01,096 --> 00:55:05,096 
And what else are you going to do 
beyond the next penskalle? 

415 
00:55:06,197 --> 00:55:10,697 
You killed his father, so the 
He tried to nirhata you. 

416 
00:55:11,098 --> 00:55:11,698 
So to me, at least influence. 

417 
00:55:16,134 --> 00:55:19,799 
Anyway, puppy 
will not last long. 

418 
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,800 
It is raahautunut behind this 
the heat for days. 

419 
00:55:24,601 --> 00:55:27,401 
He died on the morning at the latest. 

420 
00:55:51,684 --> 00:55:54,402 
Father forgive. 

421 
00:56:50,931 --> 00:56:53,836 
You would have seen his appearance, -- 

422 
00:56:54,037 --> 00:56:58,437 
when I showed him, he died in 
The son of live downstream. 

423 
00:56:58,838 --> 00:57:03,838 
Do not forget that Afro Samurai 
you did what you have today. 

424 
00:57:04,739 --> 00:57:08,439 
He experiences the land of hell, it 
What good did to us. 

425 
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:15,440 
Enjoy every seconds of pain, 
the production of him. 

426 
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:19,441 
We believe when a lot of his 
leaking blood. 

427 
00:57:19,842 --> 00:57:24,742 
We listen to his murtuvien 
bones sound. 

428 
00:57:25,043 --> 00:57:29,743 
Haistelemme his pelkoaan 
and the burning of its meat. 

429 
00:57:50,469 --> 00:57:54,944 
His death is so terrible -- 

430 
00:57:55,845 --> 00:57:57,845 
that it is remembered legend. 

431 
00:57:58,246 --> 00:58:02,946 
And I was his legendary 
executioner. 

432 
00:58:43,094 --> 00:58:47,647 
Mountain climbing and not 
even qualify for a joke. 

433 
00:58:48,048 --> 00:58:51,448 
We do not have the tools and 
I need a drink. 

434 
00:58:52,149 --> 00:58:56,749 
Do you have a rope? Shall 
certainly the right direction? 

435 
00:59:00,407 --> 00:59:06,050 
I'm just a country. Perhaps I 
get slaagin. 

436 
00:59:06,351 --> 00:59:10,051 
You make me nervous. 
I hate high places. 

437 
00:59:28,977 --> 00:59:31,677 
Is this is a disaster, the Central? 

438 
00:59:32,178 --> 00:59:36,478 
Damn! Once this place 
was wonderful. 

439 
00:59:36,879 --> 00:59:39,279 
Just as it would need to 
played violent games. 

440 
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:44,280 
Is there a 
huumehörhöjä, gangs? 

441 
00:59:45,881 --> 00:59:48,281 
If you were so have moved. 

442 
00:59:48,682 --> 00:59:52,482 
What has happened here? 
Disgust watch. 

443 
00:59:52,883 --> 00:59:54,883 
Who did this? 

444 
00:59:55,084 --> 00:59:56,684 
Afro-bye. 

445 
00:59:57,085 --> 01:00:01,085 
Is this is certainly the place 
in which he said looked forward to. 

446 
01:00:01,386 --> 01:00:03,986 
Look at this. 
Here is Justice. 

447 
01:00:04,887 --> 01:00:07,987 
You will not otherwise polls directions along the way. 

448 
01:00:08,288 --> 01:00:10,988 
Afro Hey! 

449 
01:00:49,575 --> 01:00:51,989 
Keitäs are these? 

450 
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:57,590 
Naamiaiskulkue? Welcome Committee? 
Comedy Team? 

451 
01:00:58,991 --> 01:01:03,091 
Thanks, but no thanks. We 
There is a pressing meeting. 

452 
01:01:06,389 --> 01:01:07,992 
Let's see. 

453 
01:01:08,493 --> 01:01:15,993 
Funny Face. Have you seen the crazy sexy 
ämmää teddykarhunpää hemmon with. 

454 
01:01:17,994 --> 01:01:20,594 
I did not mean evil. 

455 
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,695 
What the ...? 

456 
01:01:25,396 --> 01:01:30,296 
Afro? Kuolenko me? 
Damn! 

457 
01:01:34,497 --> 01:01:38,497 
Vatiatar šio not here. 

458 
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:45,198 
You don 't remember us from Afro Samurai? 

459 
01:01:46,499 --> 01:01:53,799 
Who would have imagined that the son of a 
once knew it would return executioner. 

460 
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:56,800 
The only motivation 
killer frenzy 

461 
01:01:57,001 --> 01:02:00,101 
To bring death and 
world of chaos. 

462 
01:02:03,402 --> 01:02:06,446 
Reveal the sword Afro Samurai. 

463 
01:03:08,565 --> 01:03:11,053 
Now, you die. 

464 
01:03:28,009 --> 01:03:31,554 
- Professor. 
- What is it mistress? 

465 
01:03:32,055 --> 01:03:38,555 
Rejoice because Afron father's life 
campaign is nearing completion. 

466 
01:03:39,056 --> 01:03:46,856 
However, this is a sensitive phase and 
the slightest mistake can ruin everything. 

467 
01:03:49,357 --> 01:03:53,436 
- They are gone. 
- What do you mean? 

468 
01:03:54,237 --> 01:03:58,537 
They were not doing anything 
without any commands. What have you done? 

469 
01:03:58,738 --> 01:04:01,538 
Maybe they left the city. 

470 
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,739 
What do you mean? 

471 
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:10,440 
Or maybe they sued Afro 
Samurai alone. 

472 
01:04:10,841 --> 01:04:15,541 
Do not be afraid. Perhaps they 
may even win. 

473 
01:04:17,242 --> 01:04:23,542 
Yllätyt perhaps kuullessasi, but they 
is a lot of hardware -- 

474 
01:04:23,843 --> 01:04:30,843 
connected to them in the trunk. And 
Furthermore, are full of drugs. 

475 
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:43,044 
Šio mistress? 
What does this mean? 

476 
01:04:52,066 --> 01:04:57,845 
May wonder how the princess Rushing 
we have. 

477 
01:04:58,246 --> 01:05:01,046 
Regeneration has not yet ... 

478 
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:07,547 
You have done a splendid job, Professor. 

479 
01:05:07,748 --> 01:05:15,248 
You did everything as I wanted. 
For thanks. 

480 
01:05:16,449 --> 01:05:21,649 
Now it is time well 
ansaitulle lomallesi. 

481 
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:25,650 
Good night, Professor. 

482 
01:05:40,097 --> 01:05:44,251 
Another executioners 
starts to wake up. 

483 
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:10,502 
Aikomuksistasi viis. There are things that are 
we do not allow you to do. 

484 
01:07:11,103 --> 01:07:15,503 
We can not allow the queen bee of Sion 
sink into darkness. 

485 
01:07:15,704 --> 01:07:18,804 
A wonderful young lady, when you have. 

486 
01:07:19,305 --> 01:07:22,805 
We will not allow his ylväytensä suffer. 

487 
01:07:23,006 --> 01:07:26,806 
We are a sinner factors 
on his behalf. 

488 
01:08:01,725 --> 01:08:05,507 
I wanted to Afron, only to see 
tuhoamansa city. 

489 
01:08:05,808 --> 01:08:10,508 
I wanted to see syntiensä sanctions, 
throat before cutting. 

490 
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:13,509 
But now we are vasallini 
probably dead. 

491 
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:19,810 
Hölmöt the road, which is only 
angels would saunter. 

492 
01:09:03,452 --> 01:09:06,700 
Michael, shoot him. 

493 
01:09:09,101 --> 01:09:12,701 
What are you waiting for? 
Do it. 

494 
01:09:13,402 --> 01:09:17,302 
Shoot 'em. He is 
already dead. 

495 
01:09:17,903 --> 01:09:21,503 
Do-it-mistress Sion behalf. 

496 
01:09:46,928 --> 01:09:48,804 
Go away. 

497 
01:10:27,954 --> 01:10:30,478 
Afro Samurai ... 

498 
01:10:32,179 --> 01:10:37,979 
I knew that before long 
such a day would be affected. 

499 
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:44,380 
We die together. 

500 
01:11:17,546 --> 01:11:19,233 
Afro you made it. 

501 
01:11:19,434 --> 01:11:22,134 
How did you do it? 
Why not only property? 

502 
01:11:22,335 --> 01:11:26,535 
I got hit, and the arrow on it. 
Fortunately, I am steel. 

503 
01:11:26,836 --> 01:11:29,536 
Teilasit the comedy of the pump? 

504 
01:11:38,443 --> 01:11:40,337 
What the ...? 

505 
01:11:52,168 --> 01:11:54,238 
Follow me, son. 

506 
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:57,439 
It is not my God! 

507 
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:02,840 
I have officially seen it all. 

508 
01:12:18,686 --> 01:12:21,241 
Sio, Jinno. 

509 
01:12:22,042 --> 01:12:25,542 
Afro-bye! Why do you need to walk 
each trap. 

510 
01:12:25,843 --> 01:12:27,843 
Are you latvasta rotten? 

511 
01:12:28,144 --> 01:12:31,944 
Here can be found in the wires 
vetelevä crazy bitch. 

512 
01:12:32,145 --> 01:12:36,145 
And once again come to life robottikamusi, 
who does not like you. 

513 
01:12:36,246 --> 01:12:41,246 
Kirsikkana cake turned on a freak, 
you think you isäksesi. 

514 
01:12:41,447 --> 01:12:43,947 
That is the right father. 

515 
01:12:47,453 --> 01:12:50,748 
Wrong answer, and it 
makes you idiots. 

516 
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:53,649 
And beyond that I do not come. 

517 
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,850 
See you. 

518 
01:13:02,298 --> 01:13:06,451 
I came to my father, and 
nro.1 forehead because of the tape. 

519 
01:13:06,952 --> 01:13:08,852 
Surprise, surprise. 

520 
01:13:09,153 --> 01:13:14,553 
What can you do, the body of a 
that right? 

521 
01:13:30,818 --> 01:13:35,554 
We kidutamme you. Death 
will be a slow process. 

522 
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,555 
Why not have nro.1 forehead tape? 

523 
01:13:54,456 --> 01:13:57,856 
I just wanted to take revenge on you. 

524 
01:13:58,657 --> 01:14:05,657 
Was the reason for the removal, the fate of the burden 
must assume the forehead after receiving the tape. 

525 
01:14:05,758 --> 01:14:08,058 
You should know this by now. 

526 
01:14:08,259 --> 01:14:14,259 
Nro.1 can never escape from 
vuodatusta blood. 

527 
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:22,160 
Nro.1 kill or 
will be killed. 

528 
01:14:22,361 --> 01:14:26,161 
You can not pick and choose who 
blood hides. 

529 
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:32,062 
Take Back otsanauhasi. 
Take the fear son. 

530 
01:14:35,063 --> 01:14:39,063 
Father wait. 
Father. 

531 
01:15:23,016 --> 01:15:27,574 
See, see my dear brother. 

532 
01:15:28,675 --> 01:15:32,975 
Afro Samurai loppunsa points, 
Just as I planned. 

533 
01:15:33,276 --> 01:15:35,976 
For your own father's hands through. 

534 
01:15:38,928 --> 01:15:44,577 
He finally paid with pain, which 
returned to us, and thousands of others. 

535 
01:16:32,975 --> 01:16:35,577 
Jinno, Jinno! 

536 
01:16:58,456 --> 01:17:03,410 
Kill him. 
Kill him once! 

537 
01:17:46,549 --> 01:17:48,249 
A brother ... 

538 
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:59,894 
Kill her Afro, teilaa! It does not 
your father's right. 

539 
01:18:00,195 --> 01:18:02,995 
Just so, do it. 

540 
01:18:03,796 --> 01:18:06,896 
I do not intend to kill my dad. 

541 
01:18:07,097 --> 01:18:10,397 
Then came their way into Afro head. 

542 
01:18:30,369 --> 01:18:32,826 
Did you see that Jinno? 

543 
01:18:33,027 --> 01:18:36,427 
We did it. We shared at last 
right for him. 

544 
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:40,528 
And we killed him. 

545 
01:18:41,729 --> 01:18:45,229 
See, see the blast brother. 

546 
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:49,230 
Jinno ... 

547 
01:18:58,924 --> 01:19:00,731 
A brother ... 

548 
01:19:05,601 --> 01:19:08,132 
A brother ...! 

549 
01:19:18,821 --> 01:19:21,433 
What have you done? 

550 
01:19:22,734 --> 01:19:26,434 
What have you done Afrolle! 

551 
01:19:30,135 --> 01:19:31,835 
Why? 

552 
01:19:32,236 --> 01:19:36,736 
Jinno! Why protect Afroa now? 
He is dead. 

553 
01:19:37,037 --> 01:19:39,737 
It is useless! 

554 
01:19:42,785 --> 01:19:45,738 
Have you forgotten what the 
Afro did to us? 

555 
01:19:46,039 --> 01:19:48,039 
Did you? 

556 
01:20:09,303 --> 01:20:11,000 
Jinno! 

557 
01:20:21,668 --> 01:20:28,852 
Afro. Watch me 
dearest brother. 

558 
01:20:33,008 --> 01:20:38,653 
I need to protect 
sword master dojoa. 

559 
01:20:40,454 --> 01:20:43,654 
Must protect all. 

560 
01:20:45,955 --> 01:20:49,855 
Including brother, Afroa. 

561 
01:21:56,187 --> 01:22:01,215 
I love you, my Jinnoni. 

562 
01:22:05,627 --> 01:22:07,716 
My brother. 

563 
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:27,717 
It is the time elapsed. 
Is not it so šio? 

564 
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:36,718 
How could you, princess? 

565 
01:22:40,419 --> 01:22:42,719 
Jinno. 

566 
01:23:58,874 --> 01:24:04,381 
You can not win the Afro. 
To escape the hell kind. 

567 
01:24:04,682 --> 01:24:08,782 
It is too strong overcome. It does not 
not a human being. 

568 
01:24:09,483 --> 01:24:12,783 
Do not, do not! 

569 
01:24:13,084 --> 01:24:16,484 
Shut up. 

570 
01:24:17,285 --> 01:24:19,885 
It is a point over. 

571 
01:24:20,186 --> 01:24:23,386 
Excuse me, but not my father. 

572 
01:24:25,287 --> 01:24:28,887 
My father died a long time ago. 

573 
01:24:34,314 --> 01:24:36,888 
Do not be afraid. 

574 
01:25:21,596 --> 01:25:23,889 
Father. 

575 
01:26:05,778 --> 01:26:08,890 
As soon as you're ready. 

576 
01:26:23,771 --> 01:26:28,259 
Naama Stasi was judging 
hellish bad day. 

577 
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:33,560 
I noticed, right. You knew that 
it will never end. 

578 
01:26:35,761 --> 01:26:37,761 
But do not turn back. 

579 
01:26:37,962 --> 01:26:40,362 
Otherwise, to hell ryntäät. 

580 
01:27:15,498 --> 01:27:18,884 
I have been waiting for you a long time.
