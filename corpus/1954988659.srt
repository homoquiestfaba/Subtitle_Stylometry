00:00:34,102 --> 00:00:36,070
Demonic voice:
I am Satan,

2
00:00:36,104 --> 00:00:38,239
King of all
that is evil.

3
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,208
Man: In the name
of God almighty,

4
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,342
I cast ye
back to hell!

5
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,812
I command
thy putrid spirit

6
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:47,514
Be banished from
this child's soul.

7
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,516
Never!
The girl is mine!

8
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,252
Mine, mine, mine,
mine, mine, mine...

9
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,853
Don't you stick your
tongue out at me!

10
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:56,324
Aw, I'll do what
I damn well please.

11
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,825
Stop your cursing!

12
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,827
Make me, slime ball.

13
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,662
I am a priest!

14
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,197
Oh, pardon me...

15
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,532
Your reverend
and holy slime ball.

16
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,667
How about these, pops?

17
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,337
I command you,
close your blouse!

18
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,205
Watch this, bud.

19
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,208
Put down
that crucifix!

20
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,511
Ohh, I love it!

21
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,682
Stop it!
I command you!

22
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:23,384
Be gone, Satan!

23
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,687
Be gone, demon!

24
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,221
[Wind blowing]

25
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:30,391
Satan: No!

26
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:34,862
Child, crying:
Mother! Mother!

27
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,231
Mother!

28
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,767
Father, is it
all over?

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,735
Is Nancy
all right?

30
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,707
Bless you.

31
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,709
Father, how can I
possibly thank you?

[Heart beating]

33
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,120
Satan: Mayii?

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,388
Aah!

35
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:03,857
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

36
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,327
Aah! Ha ha ha!

37
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,860
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,200
Ew! Ooh!

40
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,666
Ooh, ooh!
Aah!

41
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:14,702
Aah!

42
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:16,204
[Groans]

43
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,542
Ooh.

44
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:29,282
Satan:
I'll be back!

45
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:31,418
Ooh!

46
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:33,421
Oh, shit.

47
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,887
[Sighs]

48
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,859
Ooh.

49
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,971
* I was minding my business

50
00:02:52,004 --> 00:02:53,307
* when the devil
walked in on me *

51
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:54,808
* oh, no

52
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:55,943

53
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,811
* "come on, just follow me"

54
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,813
* so I, I looked him
in the eye *

55
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,248
* and I showed him
to the door *

56
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:02,482
* oh, no

57
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,983
* and I told him
to get lost *

58
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,652
* 'cause I've been there
once before *

59

00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,842

64
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:32,346

68
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,553
* so many times before

69
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,690

Priest, German accent:
Uh, Adams?

80
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:36,377
Here.

81
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,577
Blaine?

82
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,511
Yes, father.

83
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:39,547
Grigsby?

84
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,814
Here, father.

85
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:44,651
The mormon
tabernacle choir?

86
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,354
* here

87
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:52,360
Good day to you.
I am father mayii.

88
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:55,996
And I would like to welcome
you to the seminar.

89
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:58,097
I am here to discuss
an incident in my life

90
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,300
That first destroyed,

91
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,807
And then renewed my belief
in divine intervention.

92
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,812
17 years ago, a young girl
was a victim of an episode

93
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,782
Of demonic possession,

94
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,717
And I was called in
to rescue her soul.

95
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,922
Now, that battle left me
broken physically,

96
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,022
And mentally...

97
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,726
But recently,

98
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,761
My faith has been renewed.

99
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:32,732
And I believe that even the
most cynical among you here

100
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,635
Will... Find...

101
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,704
This story...

102
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,607
Inspiring.

103
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,445
Young lady, would you
pull down your dress?

104
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:45,745
Sure.

105
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:48,949
Up!

106
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,717
Ooh.

107
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,792
Mayii: I had long since
lost track

108
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,761
Of the child Nancy.

109
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:04,831
She had grown to womanhood
and got married,

110
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,799
And had settled down
with her husband

111
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,968
And 2 lovely children,

112
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,171
In a picturesque
neighborhood

113
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,973
With playful children
and picket fences,

114
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,642
And lots of caucasians.

115
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:16,776
Ah-choo!

116
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,680
TV announcer: So,
for the fifth time,

117

This charity match

118

Between the pro hockey
all-stars,

119
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,150
And Peggy hamill's
pals on ice

120
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,818
Has turned ugly, Dan.

121
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,520
Dan: Yeah, and it was
rusty the rooster

122
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:28,956
Who started it all
with his...

123
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,156
[In a British accent]
For another episode

124
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,824
Of bride's head
revisited...

125
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,026
At last...

126
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,996
My dear, sweet,
loving bride!

127
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,098
Oh, my darling!

128
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,699
Ok, kids, dinner's
almost ready!

129
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,867
Turn off the TV!

130
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,570
What are we having?

131
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,837
Oh, your favorite...
Prime ribs, sweet potatoes,

132
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,175
Green beans...
And split pea soup.

133
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,810
[Dramatic drum beats]

134
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,181
Not again!
Oh, mom!

135
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,715
Both: I hate
split pea soup!

136
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,816
You know
we hate it.

137
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,552
Mom, we hate it!

138
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,420
I said they were
lovely children.

139
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,024
At this point, they had
not taken acting lessons.

140
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,726
Really, mom, I want
to change my name.

141
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,061
All my girlfriends
think it's dorky.

142
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,197
Oh, honey, but frieda
is such a nice name.

143
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:15,002
Not my first name.
My last name... aglet.

144
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:18,238
Come on! What's it mean,
anyway?

145
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,608
Well, frieda,
in the old days,

146
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,043
Aglet meant he who puts
those tiny plastic things

147
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,745
On the end of shoelaces.

148
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,115
See, back then, a man's name
was the same as his occupation.

149
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,882
Oh, like a man named
Fred carpenter

150
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,883
Would build houses?

151
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,084
Mm-hmm.

152
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,587
Or a Thomas Baker
made bread?

153
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:34,687
Exactly.

154
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:36,188
So, what did
John hancock do?

155
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,661
Well, there were
some exceptions.

156

God bless you!

Welcome to Ernest and
Fanny's miracle hour.

164
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,927
I am Ernest...

165
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,629
And I'm Fanny.

166
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,866
Oh, and you all know
little foo-foo.

167
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,200
All: Hi, foo-foo!

168
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,805
Oh, foo-foo says,
"God bless you, everyone."

169
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:25,806
Ha ha ha ha.

170
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:30,110
We have a terrific
line-up of inspiration

171
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,312
For you
on this program.

172
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:34,981
As usual, we'll be
reading some passages

173
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,183
From the good book.

174
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,285
And just possibly,
we will heal

175
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,621
Some of our sickly,
and/or...

176
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,122
Crippled followers.

177
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,224
And you know, Ernest,

178
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:47,160
Foo-foo just loves
when you heal people.

179
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,062
Foo-foo is
a good dog.

180
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,064
Arf!
Why, you little shit!

to watch this!

No, way!

Hey, hey, hey, hey...
Come on, now.

186

Ok, ok.
I'll change it.

I don't know...

are dead.

the mightiest evil of all...

The devil himself!

195
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,194
Never forget that Satan
constantly surrounds us,

in mind...

197

Yep. Definitely p.M.S.

I had no idea that Satan
had entered Nancy's body.

228
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,474
And seized her soul
once again.

As a matter of fact,
at that time,

So, uh, what seems
to be your problem?

263
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,025
Something came over me
last night.

264
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:16,129
I just felt such...
Incredible anger.

265
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:17,965
Then, suddenly,
I vomited on my family.

00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,566
Hmm.

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,001

Uh, smooth.

00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,873
Oh, doctor,
what could it be?

270
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,108
Possibly the flu.
I just had

271
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,110
A couple of cases
of it come in today.

272
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,577
I must admit
that hospitals

273
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,279
Have always
frightened me.

274
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,383
Nancy, relax. Relax.

275
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,089

So, what's wrong
with me?

279
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:56,135

I took a survey

280

gathered here.

their opinions,

287
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:13,485
I mean, after my exorcism,
I-I've strived to lead

288
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,656
A good, clean,
decent life.

289
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,659
I haven't done anything
morally wrong.

that rob lowe video.

291
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,131

Mayii: Nancy reached out
for the guidance of God.

301
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,523
She discovered that
she was not the only one

302

in search of the path

303

309
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,041
How long has it been

310
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,008
Since your last
confession?

Ok, uh, please
follow me.

It was here she met
father Luke brophy...

315
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,621
A dedicated young priest.

316
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,225
He who gives of himself

317
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,060
To someone
other than himself

318
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,098
Will find that
he shall receive

319

From that someone...

320

00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,710
Ok, he...

324
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,447
Shall receive
that which he gave.

325
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,083
Of himself, which,

Uh... [stammers]

327
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,721
I said he was dedicated.

328
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,590
I did not say
he was articulate.

329
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,358
Look, just be good
to each other.

330
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,960
All: Ohh!

331
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,529
With that in mind,

332
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,396
I will now ask
our ushers

333
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:06,398
To please pass around
the donation basket.

334
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,667
Our church thanks you.

335
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:11,438
Mayii: Father brophy
was a man of integrity.

336
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,773
A man dedicated
to his beliefs.

337
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,577
A man about 5' 10"
in his stocking feet.

338
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,311
It was father Luke

339
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:21,281
Who would make me
once again come face-to-face

340
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,117
With my nightmares,
and would introduce me

341
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:28,754
To some very interesting
Armenian food.

342
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,290
As a matter of fact,
it was at the dinner table

343
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,660
That he heard his brother
say, "Luke..."

344
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,062
Always wipe the rim."

345
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,740
[Knocking on door]

346
00:16:51,178 --> 00:16:52,279
Sister brothers...

347
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:53,780
Excuse me, father.

348
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,615
While tallying
the donations,

349
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,150
I came upon this note

350
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,618
With your name
written on it.

351
00:16:58,651 --> 00:16:59,719
Thank you.

352
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:04,591
Student:
Father mayii?

353
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,592
Yes, yes?

354
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,326
Is it true that
priests and nuns

355
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,061
Have orgies
in the Vatican?

356
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:09,762
What?

357
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,634
Father Luke suffered from
the burden of self-doubt,

358
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,170
Always questioning himself.

359
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,274
Was he good enough
to be a priest?

360
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,808
Should he have been
a rabbi instead?

361
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,345
After all, they do
have Sundays off.

362
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,780
And the question that
nagged him the most...

363
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,418
Why weren't there any
Japanese players in the nba?

364
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,519
Was it the hand
of the almighty

365
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,487
That drew Luke
to the phone that night?

366
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,489
[Ringing]

367
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,192
Or had he just forgotten

368
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,161
To leave his answering
machine on again?

369
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,528
Hello?

370
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,364
Father brophy?
Hi. This is Nancy aglet.

371
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,833
I'm the one that
left you that note today.

372
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,701
That's so strange.

373
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,203
I was just about
to phone you.

374
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,537
I hope I'm not
disturbing you.

375
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,539
I looked your name up
in the phone book.

376
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,674
That's ok.
Now, what's this

377
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,343
About your having
a religious problem?

378
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,509
[Sighs]

379
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,845
Honey...

380
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,847
Oh, sorry. Have you seen
my nose hair clippers?

381
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,782
Um, they're
in the, uh, cabinet.

382
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:07,854
Listen, I really can't
talk about this over the phone.

383
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,855
Is it possible you could
come over tonight,

384
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,458
So we could
speak privately?

385
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:14,126
Uh, well, you see,
it's my, uh...

386
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,663
Please, father.
It's very, very serious.

387
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,530
Sure. Where
do you live?

388
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:22,702
I live at 733 sex drive.

389
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,237
Thank you.
Good-bye.

390
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,173
Good-bye.

391
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,382
Hey, let's play

392
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,449
With the mystic
spirit board, ok?

[Doorbell rings]

394
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,187
Enter, please.

395
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,558
Well, welcome,
father.

396
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,394
I'm Braydon aglet.

397
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,761
Hello.

398
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,263
And these are my
children ned and frieda.

399
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,530
Hi.
Ned: Hi.

400
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,931
Come on, dad,
let's play!

401
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:55,268
Come on, dad,
please, let's play.

402
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,769
In a second.

403
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,271
Nancy said you'd
be dropping by.

404
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,571
Something about her
doing some work

405
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,807
With the church?

406
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,343
Uh, something
like that, yes.

407
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,777
What should we
ask it first, dad?

408
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,280
Oh, well, uh... Well,
there's something

409
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,281
I've always wanted
to ask.

410
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,916
Will Ted Kennedy
ever become president?

411
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,917
[Whooshing]

412
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:24,831
Ho ho ho! I guess
not, eh, kids?

413
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,632
[Demonic voice] Braydon,
I thought we'd spoken

414
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,401
About using that thing
in this house.

415
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,271
I never want to see that
thing in this house again!

416
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:38,211
Ohh! Oh, I'm so sorry!

417
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,379
Ohh...

418
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,648
Father, maybe we could...

419
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,817
Go in the other room
and speak privately?

420
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:45,885
Sure.

421
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,889
It was... it was very
nice meeting you.

422
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,498
I-I assume you don't
want your family

423
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,499
Knowing about this.

424
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,200
No, I don't.

425
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,837
No one knows what
happened to me in my past.

426
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,274
And what I believe is
happening to me now.

427
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,940
Ok, and what exactly
is that?

428
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,745
I believe I'm being
possessed by the devil.

429
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,715
The devil?

430
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,352
Mrs. aglet, are you
under any kind

431
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,621
Of psychiatric care
at all?

432
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,357
I once gave my word
never to show anyone

433
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,793
What you are
about to see.

434
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,939
High school
debating champion?

435
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,849
Papal seal
of possession?

436
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,321
Signed by the pope.

437
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:56,956
Mrs...

438
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,893
Mrs. aglet,
I apologize,

439
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,829
But I guess
I've always felt

440
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:05,030
That these stories
of demonic possession

441
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,334
Were nothing more
than religious folklore.

442
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,571
Why did you call me?
Why didn't you contact

443
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,740
The exorcist... father magi?

444
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,940
Mayii. Father
Jedediah mayii.

445
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:19,711
Well, they say he
retired from the church

446
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,848
Right after
my exorcism.

447
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,716
What makes you think that
you're being possessed again?

448
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,889
Satan's spirit flew
right out of my TV set

449
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,923
And into my soul.

450
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,093
Ok...

451
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:36,896
Oh, no, I know it
sounds crazy,

452
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,731
But it must be true.

453
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,834
Father,
please help me.

454
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:44,437
Please!

455
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,439
I'll do
whatever I can.

00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,408
Here...

457
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:49,741
Take this.

458
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,378
It might help.

460
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:05,624
Uh, I, uh...

00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,427
I got to go now, ok?

462

anywhere, scuzzball!

Dad! Mom's humping
the priest!

[In a high voice]
Here's the, uh, camera,

476
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,631
And the cassette recorder
that you asked for.

477
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:45,831
Thank you.

478
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,500
Father, what's
going on here?

479
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:50,168
I mean, we just had to tie
my wife down to the bed.

480
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,872
I've never done anything
like that before in my life.

481
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:54,507
Well, except
that one time

482
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:55,975
When the kids
were away at camp.

483

Mr. aglet...

484
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,011
I don't know what's
wrong with your wife,

485
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,046
But I'll certainly
do all I can

486
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,380
To find out.

Hello, Nancy.

I must say, you
certainly don't look

491
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,224
Anything like you did
a few minutes ago.

I am the devil!

Well...

494
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,899
I guess that means
that you and I have gone

495
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,035
From being friends
to being enemies.

496
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:59,138
I am far more powerful
than you can ever imagine.

497

Maybe...

498
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,580
However, you are
but one being.

499
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:11,951
I represent the belief
of far more people.

500
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,753
Did you know that
the Christian religion

501
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,855
Has over
a billion followers?

502
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:19,058
Big deal. So does
the wheel of fortune.

503
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,894
So, don't try to impress me
with numbers.

504
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,931
I hate all forms
of religion.

505
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:29,100
And I hate all who
do not bow in my presence,

themselves a baptist,

or a Jew!

who screwed with me

a dislocated shoulder.

looked like me. I-i...

Does that look like me?

522

I think it looks more
like Phil donahue.

You silly,
weak fool!

In a God you've
never even seen before.

I don't need
to see him,

527
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,284

that God created man

are the devil,

Then why don't
you prove it?

How about you do
something supernatural?

535
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,842

00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,312

No feathers. We'll use
the whole chicken.

543
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,666
Ahem.

544
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,836
Father brophy
was very disturbed.

545
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,904
[Door closes]

546
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:19,711
So, father,
what happened?

547
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,615
It may sound
unbelievable,

548
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:24,250
But my guess
is that Nancy is...

549
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,885
[Dramatic music playing]

550
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:31,990
Possessed
by the devil.

551
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,259
Yeah, I knew it!

552
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,260
He said
it's only a guess!

553
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,295
I still say
it's p.M.S.

554
00:26:36,327 --> 00:26:39,666
Mayii: As father brophy drove
from the aglet home,

555
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:42,168
A great fear welled up
within him

556
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,002
Like a big sneeze.

557
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,204
You feel it build,

558
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,706
But you know you can't stop it

559
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,641
Without making your ears plug up

560
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:50,877
And a bubble come out
of your nose.

561
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,343
How could he,

562
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:54,714
A young, inexperienced priest,

563
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:57,817
Do battle alone
with the dark lord himself?

564
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,918
Then, it came to him

565
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,620
Like a sign from heaven.

566
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,189
[Brakes screeching]

567
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,724
Man: Hey, hey!

568
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,357
I can't see nothing!
What are you doing up there?

569
00:27:06,392 --> 00:27:07,358
Second man:
What's going on?

570
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,328
Is that you?
Hey, get up!

571
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:13,264
Mayii: The young priest
had read about

572
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,735
The exorcism I had performed
in 1973

573
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:20,338
As well as my 17-year
decline into oblivion.

574
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,107
But he tried to call me anyway.

575
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:31,082
Mayii: Strangely, my number
kept ringing busy.

576
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:34,085
Was it Satan's trickery at work?

577
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,988
Or was it just my party line?

578
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,389
[Noise maker blows]

[People laughing
and cheering on phone]

580
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,795
If he had reached me,

581
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,764
I would have told him
not to come.

582
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:47,166
I was weak and tired,

583
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,836
Listless, out of sorts, and...

584
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:52,403
My stools were a little loose.

585
00:27:58,409 --> 00:27:59,410
Sister, I'm looking
for the room...

586
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,146
Hold out your hands.

587
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,849
Excuse me?

588

Don't run
in the hallways!

591
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,762
Now, what do you need?

592
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:18,798
Which room is father
Jedediah mayii in?

593
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,165
Upstairs on the left.

594

Ah-ah-ah!

Ow!

I'm father Luke brophy

From our lady
of the evening.

00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,939
I'm terribly sorry
for coming by so late,

614
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,740
But there's someone who
desperately needs you,

615
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,009
Someone you helped
a long time ago.

616
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,812
Someone I helped
a long time ago?

00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,013
Who?

618
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,080
Nancy aglet.

619
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:09,414
I don't, uh...

620
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:10,882
Recall the name.

621
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,484
Well, then maybe you'll
recall her exorcism.

622
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,186
Oh, good lord.

623
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:17,223

That poor child.

She barely survived
the exorcism,

628
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,967
As did I.

629
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:32,203
And you say that
she needs my help?

630
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,139
I think Nancy has been...

00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:35,506
[Dramatic music plays]

632
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,011

How can you be sure?

638
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:55,294
She's displaying
all the main traits...

639
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,463
An ungodly voice,

640
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,097

642
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,800
But that doesn't
prove a thing.

643
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,370
She could be
related to Joe cocker.

644
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,237
No.

645
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:08,340
Could it be
she has p.M.S.?

I can't!

Father,
are you all right?

657
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,424
It's my heart.

658
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,593
It began at Nancy's exorcism.

659
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,629
That's why
I can't help you.

660
00:30:30,661 --> 00:30:33,098
If Satan should find me
in this weakened condition,

661
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,565
He could take
possession of my soul

662
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,335
And become even stronger.

663
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:38,236
But if you can't
help her, who can?

664
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,338
I don't know.

665
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,339

I don't.

00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:43,308
I don't.

But... good lord, yes!

668
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,646

It is your destiny.

There's no way.

673
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:01,060
You see, there's something
that I haven't told you.

674
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:01,860
I think I've
lost my faith.

675

Luke!

676
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:06,498
I never want to hear you

677
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,500

like that again.

678

Now, why...

Why don't you...

680
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,178
Look at it like this.

681
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,448
Maybe this is God's way
of reaffirming your faith.

682
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:24,550
While you're
saving Nancy's soul,

683
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:27,386
You're also saving your own
soul at the same time.

684
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,621
After all, God does work
in strange ways, doesn't he?

685
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,924
Yes. Yes, he does.

686
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,926
Good.

687
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:39,264
You've given me a lot
to think about, father.

God bless you, son.

691
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:47,372
Now, you have a great
deal of work to do.

692
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,509
And Luke...

693
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,578
[Echoing voice]
May the faith be with you.

wimping out

And allowing a wuss
like father Luke

702
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:24,010
To go up against Satan
all by himself?

703
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:25,576
I mean, didn't
you feel like

704
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,679
A complete piece
of gutless, spineless,

705

Primordial slime?

706
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,220
Next question.

707
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:38,057
Mayii: Luke knew little
about the ritual of exorcism,

708
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,625
So he arranged for a meeting

709
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:42,327
With the supreme council
for exorcism grantings.

to your right.

Mayii: His stomach was acting
up like a schnauzer in heat.

714
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,649
Would they believe him?

715
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,352
Would they mock him?

716
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,586
Would they validate his parking?

717
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,491
He turned to the good book
for comfort.

When they're no longer
of use to us.

Aah. I always
wanted to do that.

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is father brophy,

We have an emergency.

1271
00:55:48,446 --> 00:55:50,114
I beg of you,
if you're a man of God,

1272
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,483
Please rush to the global

Oh, sorry
for the young priest's

done much TV, you know.

1277
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:05,996
But I'd like all you
viewers at home now

1278
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,798
To gather
around your TV sets.

flew out of the TV!

00:56:23,647 --> 00:56:26,149
Ahh...

1283
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:28,852

stopped me,

But think again.

those people!

you're going?!

00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,467
I'm going to Disneyland!

1289
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:50,874
Stop! Or I swear,

1290
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:53,177
Father mayii will burn
in hell forever!

1291
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:55,680
You can't burn
what you don't have.

1292
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,146

ultimate confrontation

Of good against evil.

1364
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,051
Now, there's
a man out there,

1365
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:24,754
Who many years ago

1366
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:29,893
Banished me from the
very soul I now possess.

1367
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:32,930
He humiliated me!

1368
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:37,000
And now, I've come back
to settle matters.

1369
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:39,203
And I'm not leaving

1370
01:00:39,236 --> 01:00:43,072
Until I have his
stinking, rotten soul.

the other networks

1376
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:56,787
Don't have dick
to watch tonight.

1377
01:00:56,821 --> 01:00:59,423
So, do we
do battle again?

1378
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:01,124
Or do you cherry out

1379
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:03,660
And let me keep
this soul forever?

1380
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,264
What do you say, mayii?

1381
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:09,766
[Whispering] No...

goes match-up, Jess.

It doesn't get any better
than this, mean gene,

But everyone knows
mayii's got a bad ticker.

you cheap bastard?!

a shot in hell!

01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:10,253
Luke!

1395
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11,220
Father, what are you...

1396
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:12,555
Were you watching on TV?

1397
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:15,424
Yes. I had to come.
I had no choice.

1398
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,960
Well, what about
your heart?

1399
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:19,263
Don't worry about that.
I brought it with me.

1400
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,563
Father,
this could kill you.

1401
01:03:20,597 --> 01:03:23,432
Yes. Yes, but that's
irrelevant.

1402
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:26,303
Satan is fighting
to take control here.

1403
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:27,937
Well, I'm not
so sure.

1404
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:29,572
Remember, his
opponent is a woman.

1405
01:03:29,606 --> 01:03:31,108
Nice tits, sure,

1406
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,109
But a face
I wouldn't want to

1407
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,110
Wipe my feet on.

1408

01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,112
My money's on mayii.

1410
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,882
Satan: Mayii!

1411
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,585
And they wonder
why priests

1412
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:44,454
Never get married.

1413
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:47,123
Now, Luke, I'm going
to need your assistance,

1414
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,426
But if you are still
lacking in faith,

1415
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:52,128
You may be more harm
than good.

1416
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,597
Are you?
No way.

1417
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:55,465
You can count on me.
Good.

1418
01:03:55,499 --> 01:03:57,434
Now, just remember
one thing:

1419
01:03:57,467 --> 01:03:59,302
The devil is
always trying

1420
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,470
To take over your mind.

1421
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:03,007
He'll lie to you,
he will deceive you.

1422
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,241
He will totally try
to manipulate you.

1423
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:07,311
So do not listen
to anything

1424
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:08,644
That he has to say.

1425
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,146
He's worse than
a studio executive.

1426
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,314
Understood?
Understood.

1427
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:12,615
Worse than
a real estate agent,

A divorce attorney...

1429
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,285
I got it.
Right.

1430
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,553
All right, then.

1431
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:21,926
Let's go.

[Imitating Carol ann]
They're here...

1433
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,635
Ah...

1434
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:36,040
I see it pays to advertise
on television.

1435
01:04:36,073 --> 01:04:39,509
I think a little mood
lighting is appropriate.

1436
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:41,378
Don't you?

1437
01:04:41,411 --> 01:04:42,579
There.

1438
01:04:42,611 --> 01:04:44,680
Have no fear,
my son.

1439
01:04:44,713 --> 01:04:48,485
We have the Bible,
we have our faith.

1440

And as a back-up,
these beauties.

01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:55,191
That's an illegal
foreign object!

1442
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,360
Jesse, what do you
know about fairness?

1443
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:00,430
I'll show you fairness!

1444
01:05:00,464 --> 01:05:03,332
Are you just
about finished?

1445
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,202
It's been
a long time, mayii.

1446
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:10,206
I've waited an eternity
to do to you

1447
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,979
What you did to me
all those years ago.

1448
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:20,217
Before I do,
I've got something...

1449
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,452
Special for you.

1450
01:05:34,498 --> 01:05:36,466
That is disgusting,
mean gene!

1451
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,301
I have never seen
a move like that

1452
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:40,070
In all my years
of wrestling!

1453
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:41,038
Whew!

1454
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,409
So...

1455
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:49,412
How do you like it?

1456
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:52,415
Oh, you'll pay for that,
you bucket of cow dung.

1457
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:53,749
How dare you, you...

1458
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:55,418
How long has she
been in this condition?

1459
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,554
A few days.
How does look?

1460
01:05:57,587 --> 01:05:59,422
Not too good.
She looks like

1461
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:02,626
She's been existing
solely on airline food.

1462
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:03,960
Your father wears
tight underwear!

1463
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,729
And I can't stand
your mother!

1464
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,598
Will you put
a sock in it?!

1465
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:12,469
Jeez, what crawled up
your butt and died?

1466
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:14,737
Every night I prayed

1467
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:18,141
To never again gaze
on your grotesque face,

1468
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:20,777
Listen to your
venomous voice,

1469
01:06:20,809 --> 01:06:23,280
But with you right
in front of me now,

1470
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,615
I thank God that I have
the opportunity

1471
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:29,752
To boot your stinking
carcass back to hell,

1472
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:32,789
You worthless,
you rotting,

1473
01:06:32,821 --> 01:06:35,258
You vulgar spirit.

1474
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:36,425
Hey, hey, hey!

1475
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:37,627
Where does it say

1476
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:39,328
You can talk to me
like that?

1477
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,631
Right here.

1478
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:45,669
Oh, sure, you may feel
pretty cocky right now,

1479
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:47,637
But you'll soon realize

1480
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:50,339
That I am far
too powerful for you.

1481
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:53,777
And I am a man of God.

1482
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:55,811
And I fear no one,

1483
01:06:55,844 --> 01:06:59,448
Especially an unholy spirit
from an unsavory world.

1484
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:02,318
Unsavory? Aw, come on.

1485
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:05,255
You've got just as many
unsavory types here.

1486
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:07,624
From those domino's
pizza delivery boys

1487
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:09,659
To that idiot
in the back row

1488
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,795
Who won't shut up
during the movie.

1489
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:13,330
Enough!

1490
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:15,464
This is meandering.

1491
01:07:15,499 --> 01:07:17,767
Father, my lunch bucket.

1492
01:07:28,677 --> 01:07:30,347
Holy water.

1493
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:31,648
The church was closed.

1494
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,651
The only place open
was a 7-11.

1495
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:35,652
Ahh, thank you,

1496
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:37,687
You've been
a lovely audience.

1497
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:38,854
And next,
I'd like to do

1498
01:07:38,887 --> 01:07:41,357
My impression of
comedian don Adams.

1499
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,392
[Imitating don adams]
Where's the chief, 99?

1500
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:46,830
Do not get smart with me!

1501
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:49,365
On a visit to the little
town of Bethlehem,

1502
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:51,101
A young Shepherd
came upon Jesus,

1503
01:07:51,135 --> 01:07:52,535
Accepted him lord...

1504
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:54,238
Lick me!
Lick me!

1505
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:56,439
Lick me!

1506
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,208
Oh, is this cool
or what?

1507
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:00,710
It's the cone-ilingus move.

1508
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:01,845
Why don't you
take a lick

1509
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:03,379
Of this
candy stick,

1510
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:06,115
You sissy boys!
Hee hee hee!

1511
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,284
That's disgusting!

1512
01:08:07,317 --> 01:08:10,220
And the living Jesus
said unto him,

1513
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:12,688
"He who is strong
in his belief of God

1514
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:15,224
Shall have
his sins forgiven."

1515
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:17,327
What a levitation move!

1516
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,362
Jesus said unto him...

1517
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:20,264
Father.

1518
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:22,166
Luke, do not believe
what you are seeing.

1519
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:23,767
It is merely
an illusion.

1520
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:26,470
You sound like George Bush
on the deficit!

1521
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:29,139
But she's floating
in midair.

1522
01:08:29,173 --> 01:08:30,140
Nancy: Hey!
What are you doing

1523
01:08:30,174 --> 01:08:31,275
With those scissors?

1524
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:32,541
Hey!

1525
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:33,742
Ohh!

1526
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:34,577
Ouch!

1527
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:37,913
That was the antigravity
backdrop. Wow!

1528
01:08:37,946 --> 01:08:39,683
Illegal, mean gene!

1529
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:41,718
As I said, it is
merely an illusion.

1530
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:42,886
Nancy: Oh, yes.

1531
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:45,588
That may have been
an illusion.

1532
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:48,591
But I know something
that's very real.

1533
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:49,425
Your heart
condition!

1534
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,427
[Groans]

1535
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,397
[Heart beating]

1536
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,400
Oh, but don't worry.

1537
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:59,403
Far be it from me to
want to rattle you.

1538
01:08:59,435 --> 01:09:01,370
[Rumbling]

1539
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:04,140
Unh!
Oh!

1540
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,643
Say your prayers,
mayii.

1541
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:08,645
Because soon
you'll be history.

1542
01:09:08,678 --> 01:09:10,579
That's enough!

1543
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:11,915
In the name of God,

1544
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:13,916
I demand you stop
this charade!

1545
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:17,454
You... Demand?

1546
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:18,687
You're not
in a position

1547
01:09:18,722 --> 01:09:20,224
To demand dick,
altar boy!

1548
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:21,857
See, I know
all about you.

1549
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,528
And why you really
joined the church.

1550
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,861
Oh, sure.

1551
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:28,364
They have a terrific
dental plan.

1552
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:29,298
But that wasn't why.

1553
01:09:29,333 --> 01:09:30,499
Be quiet.

1554
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:31,500
Ignore that
beast, Luke.

1555
01:09:31,535 --> 01:09:32,336
You joined the church

1556
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:34,771
Because you had
no talents, no skills,

1557
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:35,905
Were totally
untrainable,

1558
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:38,775
And your s.A.T. Score
was under 400.

1559
01:09:38,808 --> 01:09:40,543
Shut up!
Don't listen!

1560
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,679
So, you had 2 choices.

1561
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:44,547
Either working
in the church,

1562
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:45,981
Or the U.S. senate.

1563
01:09:46,014 --> 01:09:48,484
I said, shut up,
damn you! Shut up!

1564
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:51,420

to thank you

For joining the church.

1570
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:04,200
Because of you,
I'll be able to keep

1571
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,469
This woman's soul
forever.

1572
01:10:07,736 --> 01:10:10,373
I have no right
calling myself a priest.

1573

01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,543

you to leave.

a school day. Please?

01:20:22,450 --> 01:20:24,586
* he's coming back

1798
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:26,955
* he's coming back

1799
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:28,992
* he's coming

1800
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,159
* he's back,
thought he was gone, Jack *

1801
01:20:31,194 --> 01:20:33,461
* now, in fact, he's back,
and that as a black *

1802
01:20:33,496 --> 01:20:35,463
* panther prowlin',
bound to attack *

1803
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:37,632
* a child lost in the wild

1804
01:20:37,665 --> 01:20:40,003
* this was his prey:
A girl Nancy *

1805
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:41,604
* would she get away?
Or could she? Can she *

1806
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:44,007
* find a way out?
I doubt *

1807
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:46,342
* if she could,
'cause the devil's all about *

1808
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:50,312
* evil power ruling intended,
bad intentions always demented *

1809
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:52,314
* through a TV set he sent it

1810
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:54,649
* soul destroyer,
and he meant it *

1811
01:20:54,682 --> 01:20:56,619
* like before,
the curse will persist *

1812
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:58,487
* part one of the exorcist *

1813
01:20:58,521 --> 01:21:00,655
* but this time father mayii's
twice as pissed *

1814
01:21:00,688 --> 01:21:02,625
* because once again
Linda Blair got dissed *

1815
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:04,627
* the devil

1816
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:06,095
* he's coming

1817
01:21:06,128 --> 01:21:07,162
* back

1818
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:09,164
* the devil

1819
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:10,298
* he's coming

1820
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:11,299
* back

1821
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:13,169
* the devil

1822
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:14,302
* he's coming

1823
01:21:14,337 --> 01:21:15,303
* back

1824
01:21:15,338 --> 01:21:17,305
* the devil

1825
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:19,507
* he's coming

1826
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:22,045
* he' back,
and he's on a rampage *

1827
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:24,212
* like a madman through a crowd
with a 12-gauge *

1828
01:21:24,247 --> 01:21:26,648
* shotgun, but this one's
the terrible ruler of hell *

1829
01:21:26,682 --> 01:21:28,516
* he makes lives unbearable

1830
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:30,686
* ask father mayii
or father Luke *

1831
01:21:30,718 --> 01:21:33,056
* he seized Nancy's soul,
and he made her puke *

1832
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:34,522
* up pea soup all over
a priest's suit *

1833
01:21:34,557 --> 01:21:36,358
* and I used to think
Linda Blair was cute *

1834
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,527
* now she's haunted,
taken control of again *

1835
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:41,064
* in the end, good will triumph
and always win *

1836
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:43,066
* in the meantime, though,
you watch her head spin *

1837
01:21:43,099 --> 01:21:45,300
* it's 360, the face of sin
rapidly turnin' *

1838
01:21:45,333 --> 01:21:47,070
* bed posts burnin'

1839
01:21:47,103 --> 01:21:49,038
* it's gonna take a lot more
than some stupid silly sermon *

1840
01:21:49,072 --> 01:21:51,206
* to destroy him
or even annoy him *

1841
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:54,010
* in his time of demonic,
chaotic mayhem *

1842
01:21:54,043 --> 01:21:55,544
* with the thrill of a chiller,
the devil ultimate killer *

1843
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:58,213
* live on Ernest
and fannie rae weller's show *

1844
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:01,550
* prime-time, so father mayii
and Luke are on the go *

1845
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:04,252
* in the gyms and liftin',
movin', quickin' *

1846
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:06,155
* buildin' confidence,
gettin' swift and *

1847
01:22:06,188 --> 01:22:08,223
* ready for butt-kickin'
at its best *

1848
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,225
* 'cause Nancy's
been repossessed *

1849
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:12,227
* the devil

1850
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:13,361

1864
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:52,434
* well, how can we send
the punk back to hell? *

1865
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,603
* was the question asked
by two on a mission *

1866
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:56,605
* restorin' the soul
to God-given condition *

1867
01:22:56,639 --> 01:22:58,607
* of life to Nancy's
body and veins *

1868
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:01,276
* 'cause Satan crawled under
her skin and into her brains *

1869
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:04,613
* like a psychoanalyst
analyzin' only bad parts *

1870
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:07,616
* hypnotizin' the rest of 'em,
gettin' the best of 'em *

* he's too nice.
The devil's scheme is mean *

1879
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:25,801
* to the fullest extent,
or so it would seem *

1880
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:28,136
* the only thing the priests
have goin' on *

1881

the wrong choice was chosen *

1883
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:34,476
