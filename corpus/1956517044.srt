1
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,185
Forgive me, baby.

2
00:00:55,316 --> 00:00:57,144
Please don't go away.

3
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:09,678
Forgive me, baby.

4
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:13,116
Please don't go away.

5
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:28,088
You'll never have to worry,because I'm here to stay.

6
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:41,579
You've got to believe it.

7
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:50,588
Baby, please don't leave it.

8
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,071
Forgive me, baby.

9
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:59,554
Please don't go away.

10
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:28,060
From now on, baby, I wantto be right by your side.

11
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:43,554
Yes, from now on, baby, I'mgoing to be right by your side.

12
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:52,998
You've got to
forgive me, baby.

13
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:01,529
Yes, you've got to
forgive me, baby.

14
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:05,010
Please promise me you'll stay.

15
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:06,306
If you can stick aroundmore than a month or two,

16
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:07,959
you might be able to
finish this thing.

17
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:18,013
They're moving your
brother up north today.

18
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:22,017
The god damn death penalty--

19
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:23,671
I suppose it doesn't
matter where you go.

20
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,723
Well, you know, I think Joe chose

21
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:36,423
that road a long time ago.

22
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:38,512
DAD: I guess Joe shouldhave taken care of business

23
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:41,036
in one of those
third-world countries,

24
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,255
got a license to
kill like you, huh?

25
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:52,308
I went to visit him lastweek, and he asked about you.

26
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,752
How's Joe's head?

27
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:04,102
Well, you know Joe.

28
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:07,584
Nothing seems to botherhim except being locked up.

29
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:08,498
Mm.

30
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:55,589
Oh, yeah.

31
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:59,201
Yeah, you look great.

32
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,638
Your husband is going tofall in love all over again.

33
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:09,124
Tracey, we out of here?

34
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:10,647
Definitely.

35
00:07:10,778 --> 00:07:11,909
Let me just clean
up around here.

36
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,258
And I'll meet you
outside in five.

37
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,391
Did you hear Alanis
is coming to Dallas?

38
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,045
Girl, the show is
sold out already.

39
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:18,916
Well, what do you expect?

40
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:21,745
Nobody ever comes to Fort Worth.

41
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,307
Plaza-- Fort Worth
Shopping Plaza.

42
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:46,395
We're under attack!

43
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,309
Everywhere.

44
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:48,179
This ain't a joke.

45
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,093
I'm telling you.

46
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:54,577
POLICE: Get him out of there.

47
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,535
Stay together.

48
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:04,065
Settle down.

49
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:15,903
All right, I got us here.

50
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,034
Now get us out.

51
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:24,433
Time for a party.

52
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,869
We got to have a party.

53
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,354
Let's try not to hurt anybody.

54
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:33,355
Yeah, right.

55
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:06,274
All hell broke loose.

56
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:08,145
Your brother and some
others busted out.

57
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:17,415
Well, I never did see Joeletting the goddamn state

58
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:20,157
put him to sleep.

59
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:23,160
Killing a drug
dealer is one thing.

60
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,988
This time, there'sinnocent people involved.

61
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:31,995
What are you going
to do about it, son?

62
00:11:44,355 --> 00:11:47,402
When you get there,
if there is a decision

63
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:51,275
to be made about yourbrother's future, you make it.

64
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:52,189
Don't let them.

65
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:07,422
I haven't been there
for Joe in the past.

66
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:10,730
This time, I'm not walking away.

67
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,906
He's my brother.

68
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:13,994
I'm going to get
him out of there.

69
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:14,619
What the fuck is this shit?

70
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,186
I'm delivering you
21st-century quality.

71
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:17,448
And you talk to me
like a Neanderthal.

72
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:18,841
Do you know who I am?

73
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:21,017
Do you know who I
know, like, globally?

74
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:23,019
Think yourself.

75
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:28,068
The last time I saw hardwarelike this was in Kuwait.

76
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:29,983
Where'd you get this shit?

77
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:32,507
So you in?

78
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:35,249
I ain't got nothing
else to do, so.

79
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:40,080
M16-203 with a grenade
launcher underneath.

80
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,559
Imagine a gun that's
smokeless, near

81
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,171
silent, with case-less ammo.

82
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:46,129
It means there's nothing
flying out where it

83
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,566
shouldn't-- the case
converting inside

84
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:49,916
the chamber into
rocket propelling

85
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:52,179
for its armor piercing rounds.

86
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:55,573
Get them while
they're hot, boys.

87
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:56,444
Billy?

88
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,272
Yeah.

89
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:01,188
Can you handle that?

90
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:02,232
Oh, yeah.

91
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:04,669
I can take care of things.

92
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,670
WOMAN: I don't want to die.

93
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:08,151
I don't want to die today.

94
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:10,632
I want to go-- let me go home!

95
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:17,552
Oh, I don't want to die.

96
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:19,510
I don't want to die!

97
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:22,035
I want to go home!

98
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:23,036
I don't want to die!

99
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:23,906
I don't want to--

100
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:25,125
Shut the fuck up!

101
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:26,604
I don't want to die!

102
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:28,084
I don't want to die!

103
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,564
I want to go home!

104
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:32,045
I don't want to die!

105
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,104
That's one less
fucking cowboy.

106
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:50,541
NEWSCASTER: Officials speculatethat one of the escapees

107
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:54,371
from the bus, convicted moneylaunderer Howard Daniels,

108
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:56,417
may have been
behind the breakout.

109
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,027
Daniels' corporate
headquarters is

110
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:00,421
based in the same
mall where the hostage

111
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,597
crisis has taken a deadly turn.

112
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,738
So, what do you
got back there, Wood?

113
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:16,916
I mean Hardwood-- just
joking, just joking.

114
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:19,396
Jesus, Mac, they're fortifyingtheir whole position here.

115
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:21,398
Yeah, what with?

116
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:22,791
I don't know what that is.

117
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,445
Here's your profile, sir.

118
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:25,359
Oh, thank you.

119
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,365
Damn, I don't know
he was on the bus--

120
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,757
Wallace Black.

121
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:34,411
Last minute thing.

122
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,457
Multiple contract
killings, a rape,

123
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:38,459
murder he got acquitted for.

124
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:41,505
Then he takes out that
casino owner in Reno.

125
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:43,943
God damn-- 20 pieces
in a dumpster.

126
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:46,380
Makes the rest of theseguys look like Boy Scouts.

127
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,816
Yeah, I don't know about that.

128
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,210
But Joe Ray didn't just
kill that drug dealer.

129
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,994
He took out his whole operation.

130
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,562
He did away with thecompetition, so to speak.

131
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:58,131
Boy, this thing can get messy.

132
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:02,048
Well, I'll be dipped.

133
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:05,094
Rudy, I didn't
know you were back.

134
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:09,490
They'll be a triage
unit set up right here.

135
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,926
Let's keep clear of this area.

136
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:12,406
Let's keep clear now.

137
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:15,757
How the hell did
you get in here?

138
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,628
I learned from you, man.

139
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,588
Well, I obviously didn't
teach you very well.

140
00:16:20,718 --> 00:16:23,199
You wouldn't-- you know,they got me running things,

141
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,679
at least for now, anyway.

142
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,463
The feds will be here
soon enough, though.

143
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:28,944
You bet your ass.

144
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:32,513
You let the feds
in here, you're

145
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,906
going to have anothergoddamn Waco on your hands.

146
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:35,907
Shit, man.

147
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,344
Don't even think about that.

148
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:40,260
I mean, I suppose you
know how to handle this.

149
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,004
I know my brother.

150
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:47,876
Yeah.

151
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,531
How much time can you give me?

152
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:53,012
Aw, Rudy, we don't workthat way around here no more.

153
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:13,684
Oh, man, this is pathetic.

154
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:15,469
It's just pathetic shit.

155
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,993
Now he has some militaryhardware, and all we've got

156
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:20,952
is a bunch of pissant
9 millimeters.

157
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:24,521
Rudy!

158
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:25,435
Shit.

159
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:35,967
What's up with
the suit, Howard?

160
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,709
Prison blue not your color?

161
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,410
It's the party
that never ends, Joe.

162
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,367
Step inside.

163
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:45,194
Step outside.

164
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:54,638
Please, enter.

165
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:57,380
Make yourself
extremely comfortable.

166
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,425
Sit anywhere.

167
00:17:58,555 --> 00:17:59,382
Sit anywhere you like, anywhere.

168
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,427
Sit there.
Sit there.

169
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:01,341
It's a gorgeous chair.

170
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:02,690
It's Michael Graves.

171
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,300
It's very comfortable.

172
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:05,649
I paid $70,000 for that chair.

173
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,347
It better fucking
be comfortable.

174
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:08,739
He wanted 20.

175
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,306
I talked him down--

176
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,526
prick.

177
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:13,614
So this is my little playground.

178
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:16,878
You like, hm?

179
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:18,532
I run all of my
operations out of here.

180
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:22,492
No one asks any questions,fabulous loading dock,

181
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:26,844
perfect front, very legitimate.

182
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,325
You look like a
drinking man, Joe--

183
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:30,805
very passionate.

184
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:32,285
Shall we?

185
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:43,078
MAN: There's a lot
of fire down here.

186
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:45,602
That's enough.

187
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,170
We had an agreement.

188
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:50,129
You put up the money.

189
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:53,567
I hired the guys
to break us out.

190
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:57,048
Then you fly our
ass out of here.

191
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:58,963
So where's the
helicopter, Howard?

192
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:00,878
It'll be here, Joe.

193
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,315
What about the boys on the bus?

194
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:03,577
Now, they weren't part
of the plan, were they?

195
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,056
Shut up.

196
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,798
What was I supposed to
do, leave them there?

197
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:10,279
As far as I'm concerned, we alldeserve a chance like anybody

198
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,021
else, except for maybe Wallace.

199
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,024
I'm starting to haveserious doubts about you.

200
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,634
Trust me.

201
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:18,809
The only possible delaycould be a weather condition.

202
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,550
He said he'll be here.

203
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:22,465
He'll be here.

204
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:23,901
Get us out of here.

205
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:27,253
The feds show up, the
negotiations stop.

206
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:28,906
And they will kick
our ass, Howard.

207
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:30,821
HOWARD: On the
country, my friend.

208
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:32,823
It'll be fun, actually.

209
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:36,349
Because I'm going to distractthem with our demands.

210
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,047
What demands?

211
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,919
We don't have any
fucking demands!

212
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:45,880
I can be quite demanding.

213
00:20:58,387 --> 00:20:59,475
Welcome to the big time, kid.

214
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:03,218
Nice clothes.

215
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:06,977
Mm.

216
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:14,942
You smell good, so good.

217
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:17,553
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

218
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:19,338
Don't move.

219
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:20,426
Don't move.

220
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:48,323
Sh, sh.

221
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:51,282
No!

222
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:54,285
Sh!

223
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:20,790
Hey, fat!

224
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,792
You're breaking
my concentration.

225
00:23:31,018 --> 00:23:33,237
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

226
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:17,020
I know you want to do me, bitch.

227
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:21,503
But first, we get
to do my friend.

228
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:36,475
Uh, uh, uh.

229
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:47,442
Yeah, yes, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.

230
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:02,413
OK.

231
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,415
Oh, yeah.

232
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:07,418
Now for something real special.

233
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:10,421
Oh, god.

234
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,902
Sh, sh, sh.

235
00:25:37,492 --> 00:25:39,320
What the hell is this?

236
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,583
These demands are a
bunch of shit, Howard.

237
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:44,934
It's called creative
confusion, my friend.

238
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:54,411
Take care of the men, Collum.

239
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:03,290
What the fuck are you
guys doing down there?

240
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,729
Oh, Jesus Christ, Wallace,put your Dick in your pants.

241
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,992
I got cobwebs on my nut sack.

242
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:12,603
And homeboy here
wants to be a hero.

243
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:15,868
This will take
your mind off it.

244
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:16,869
Oh, that's good.

245
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,000
That's good.

246
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:19,001
BILLY: Hey!

247
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:19,872
We got a problem.

248
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:28,619
You know this could
quite possibly

249
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,058
go down as the stupidest goddamn jailbreak known to man.

250
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:35,191
A guy gets caught 20 feet away,and you don't see anything?

251
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,456
Hey, I didn't hear anything.

252
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:41,894
Well, if the big chief herewasn't so busy trying to get

253
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:44,287
himself a goddamn blow job.

254
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:47,769
How about I do a blow job onyour brains all over the wall?

255
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,640
JOE: All right, all right, allright, enough with the blow

256
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,294
jobs.

257
00:28:51,425 --> 00:28:53,079
I didn't bust my ass out ofthe penitentiary to start

258
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:55,211
a babysitting career
with you guys.

259
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:57,257
Come on, Wallace, why
don't you try and take

260
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:58,693
it easy on these people?

261
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:02,218
Call it a hunch, we just
might need them later.

262
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:05,961
Look here.

263
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:08,659
I didn't ask to be, right?

264
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,052
But I'm here now.

265
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:12,054
You give me two of
your boy, all right?

266
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:14,013
Then we'll find
this son of a bitch,

267
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:16,015
and I'm going to kill him.

268
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:21,498
Cover me.

269
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:27,026
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

270
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:10,417
You, to the left--

271
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:13,420
to the right.

272
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,725
HOWARD: No, no, no this is-- no.

273
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:15,901
This is how we're going to play.

274
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:18,729
See, you're the
genie in the lamp.

275
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,514
And what I'm going to do isI'm going to rub the lamp.

276
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:21,776
And you're going
to

277
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:24,735
pop out, and give
me three wishes, OK?

278
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:25,911
Doesn't that sound like fun?

279
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,303
Tell me your name,
Mr. Policeman.

280
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:30,306
This is Sergeant Hardwood.

281
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,787
Ha- Hardwood?

282
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:35,616
Sergeant Hardwo--

283
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,966
I'm sorry.

284
00:30:38,097 --> 00:30:39,054
Get the fuck off the phone.

285
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:40,621
Give me that damn phone.

286
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:48,629
Two people are dead so far.

287
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:49,978
Do we understand each other?

288
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:52,154
OK.

289
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:55,854
I want three fully-fueled,fully-outfitted 747s.

290
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:57,899
I want one at DFW.

291
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,422
I want one at Houston
Intercontinental.

292
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:02,034
And I want one at San Antonio.

293
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:05,994
I want new ones, none of
those crappy retreads.

294
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:09,563
Are we understood?

295
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:12,827
Right now, I'm--

296
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,263
I'm getting a bit of a migraine.

297
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:18,746
So I'll have to call you back.

298
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:44,266
Son of a bitch.

299
00:32:44,397 --> 00:32:47,269
This guy's good.

300
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,229
Hey, I could use a bump.

301
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:20,476
What do you got?

302
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:51,681
I said, what do you got?

303
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,473
Oh, shit.

304
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:14,835
What are you
eyeballing, cop killer?

305
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:16,880
You want to taste that?

306
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:19,796
You want me to slice
you off a chunk?

307
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:38,206
Ignore him.

308
00:34:38,337 --> 00:34:39,164
He's an idiot.

309
00:35:02,665 --> 00:35:05,015
Son of a gun!

310
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,269
Don't worry.

311
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,663
It will be OK.

312
00:35:43,793 --> 00:35:45,186
Will it?

313
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:46,100
I hope.

314
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:52,846
What are you doing
with these guys, anyway?

315
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:54,282
Don't-- please.

316
00:35:57,851 --> 00:35:59,069
It's just hard
for me to believe

317
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,245
you're a cold-blooded killer.

318
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,035
I'm no killer.

319
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,993
I'm not.

320
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:12,605
Anyway, what does
it matter to you?

321
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:14,824
Nobody gives a shit.

322
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:16,826
I caught some bad luck.

323
00:36:16,957 --> 00:36:18,219
I had a good job.

324
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,048
I was playing in a
band in New Orleans.

325
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,224
I was good.

326
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:27,097
So I came on here trying
to find another job.

327
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:35,149
But no job, no money rightnow, sleeping on benches.

328
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,585
I was starving.

329
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:38,979
I was desperate.

330
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:40,633
I got a hold of
this little gun I

331
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:44,550
found in the park, no bullets.

332
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,335
So I went to this
convenience store.

333
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:49,337
I stuck this gun
in this man's face.

334
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:53,167
All I wanted was
some goddamn food.

335
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:57,650
I grabbed the keys to histruck, ran out of the backdoor.

336
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,350
All I could think of was eatingthe shit I'd just stolen.

337
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:04,265
I turned the corner
a little too fast.

338
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:07,747
I had some cops on my ass.

339
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:11,490
God, I was scared.

340
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,143
I couldn't see anything.

341
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,450
I smashed into another copcar and killed two of them.

342
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:21,239
I got death sentence.

343
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:32,424
Hell, maybe I deserve it.

344
00:37:32,554 --> 00:37:34,904
No, no.

345
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:44,827
My name's Tracey.

346
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:54,837
Hi.

347
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:26,695
SONNY: He's a killer.

348
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,746
Watch your ass, partner.

349
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:38,141
Because that's what I'm goingto be doing from here on in,

350
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:39,621
looking out after my ass.

351
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:47,629
Where the fuck is Wallace?

352
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,962
We got every cop in
Texas outside, Wallace.

353
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:18,094
You think you could be a
little more productive?

354
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:24,579
What in the fuck
are you doing?

355
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,711
Well, you got a problem?

356
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:27,582
Don't start, guys.

357
00:39:28,888 --> 00:39:30,150
We got shit to
take care of here.

358
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:36,374
Come on, Mama,
let's take a walk.

359
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:02,574
Can you hear me, cops?

360
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:04,097
Do I have attention?

361
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:10,582
Now, if you don't get
your men out of here--

362
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:15,674
What are you doing, baby?

363
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,420
That's going to
become a habit!

364
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,088
You scared, kid?

365
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:43,789
Yes, I'm scared.

366
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:44,659
Everybody's scared.

367
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:52,885
Who did you kill to get here?

368
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:53,799
I killed a man.

369
00:40:57,367 --> 00:41:00,849
17 years in the Marine Corps--

370
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,721
I joined up straight
out of high school.

371
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:11,077
I've been everywhere
I loved my job.

372
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:13,035
I loved it every day.

373
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:26,658
I married my--
married my sweetheart

374
00:41:26,788 --> 00:41:28,050
on her 16th birthday.

375
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:38,670
The first time we ever laideyes on each other, I was--

376
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,631
what-- in the fourth grade.

377
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:49,158
She was in the second.

378
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:53,032
After my discharge, I
had this new business.

379
00:41:53,162 --> 00:41:55,034
One day, I'm fighting this--

380
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:56,470
this bad flu I had.

381
00:41:56,601 --> 00:42:01,606
And I forgot themedication the doc gave me.

382
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:03,477
So I had go on back
home and get it.

383
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:10,179
And I couldn't
believe what I saw.

384
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:15,141
It was like a goddamn nightmare.

385
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:26,108
But there was my CO gettingdown with my old lady.

386
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:35,727
It's kind of funny when
I think about it now,

387
00:42:35,857 --> 00:42:38,643
that little old Marine
Corps tattoo on his ass

388
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:40,514
going up and down, up and down.

389
00:42:43,604 --> 00:42:45,258
And there he is,
standing up, butt

390
00:42:45,388 --> 00:42:48,957
naked with a hard dick talkingabout, wait, wait, wait,

391
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:50,698
you don't understand.

392
00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:54,310
You don't understand!

393
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:57,226
I understood.

394
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:59,577
I understood all too well.

395
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:08,890
I just grabbed that sonof a bitch round the neck.

396
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:11,763
And I squeezed.

397
00:43:11,893 --> 00:43:14,592
And I squeezed.

398
00:43:14,722 --> 00:43:17,203
And then I stabbed him 14 times.

399
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:18,944
I put my knife in him.

400
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:22,469
I twisted it until I wassure his heart was hamburger.

401
00:43:29,998 --> 00:43:31,347
I cut this throat--

402
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:39,617
Randall, model number 14.

403
00:43:42,532 --> 00:43:47,842
I carried that knife
through three campaigns.

404
00:43:47,973 --> 00:43:53,282
I finally found a
good use for it.

405
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:01,290
Are you in charge here?

406
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:03,815
I wondered when you'd
boys come rolling in.

407
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:04,903
San Antonio?

408
00:44:05,033 --> 00:44:05,773
Yeah.

409
00:44:09,385 --> 00:44:13,259
Say, aren't y'all the onesthat handled that Waco deal?

410
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:15,304
Ouch.

411
00:44:15,435 --> 00:44:17,089
Now, we understand
you let a heavily-armed

412
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:19,352
mercenary walk right in there.

413
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:21,354
Say you couldn't stop it.

414
00:44:21,484 --> 00:44:23,312
He was one of mine.

415
00:44:23,443 --> 00:44:27,447
Well, that's very
touching-- for bullshit.

416
00:44:27,577 --> 00:44:31,973
Born in El Paso, Texas, June,1960, former Marine service

417
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:34,759
in the Far East, contractcivilian mercenary

419
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:37,936
El Salvador, right.

420
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:39,502
'88 to '89.

421
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:41,983

424
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:48,163
Do you mean want whatreally interests me here?

425
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:49,077
No.

426
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:50,731
What's that?

427
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:52,733
Is this boy of yours wasa Texas Rangers for three

428
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:54,996
years right here in Fort Worth.

429
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:56,302
And I'll be damned.

430
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:57,782
He walked off the job.

431
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,353
He was my partner.

432
00:45:04,484 --> 00:45:05,572
Not anymore.

433
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:09,402
Later.

434
00:45:27,463 --> 00:45:31,119
HOWARD: I want 3 milliondollar bonds, 2 in Swiss francs

435
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:34,035
and 2 in Deutsche marks.

436
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:35,950
I want the money wired
to the Credit Suisse

437
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:37,865
then to Grand Cayman.

438
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:43,828
I'm going to have
to call you back.

439
00:45:55,143 --> 00:45:56,710
While you've been
in here dicking

440
00:45:56,841 --> 00:46:00,540
around accomplishing nothing,we've just lost five guys.

441
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:01,802
Now you do what you
gotta do, and you

442
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:03,978
get us the fuck out of here.

443
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:05,588
I'm done playing
with you, Howard.

444
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:07,634
You got an hour.

445
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:26,261
Oh, dear, that wasn't
very nice, now was it?

446
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:37,838
Excuse me?

447
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:39,797
I really need to
use the ladies room.

448
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,020
I'm going to have to
come with you, though.

449
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,459
Hey!

450
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,374
Where are you going
with my bitch?

451
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:53,680
Don't worry.

452
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,986
I'm ain't going to
rape or kill her.

453
00:46:55,116 --> 00:46:58,337
I'm just letting
her use the can.

454
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:01,340
Oh.

455
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,747
I think it's the other one.

456
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,271
Yeah.

457
00:48:09,974 --> 00:48:10,713
Sh.

458
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:18,939
Can I still pee?

459
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:20,419
Knock yourself out.

460
00:49:04,332 --> 00:49:05,681
You know what to do.

461
00:49:09,294 --> 00:49:16,997
Careful-- wouldn't want
to leave without you.

462
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:28,748
Well, I missed you, bro.

463
00:49:31,707 --> 00:49:35,146
I had a feeling I'd
be seeing you here.

464
00:49:37,844 --> 00:49:39,498
You're wasting
all my guys, Rudy.

465
00:49:42,283 --> 00:49:46,070
I'm just doing
what I gotta do, Joe.

466
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,375
And you do it good.

467
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,165
So what do we do
now, kill each other?

468
00:49:57,646 --> 00:50:00,998
How do you want
to handle this?

469
00:50:01,128 --> 00:50:04,523
How do I want to handle what?

470
00:50:04,653 --> 00:50:05,959
I'll get you out of here.

471
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:07,265
You're my brother, Joe.

472
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:08,875
I ain't going to
let nobody kill you.

473
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:17,188
The state's already
gonna kill me.

474
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:19,364
Your friend's hurtinga lot of innocent people.

475
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:28,982
I can get you out of here, bro.

476
00:50:33,465 --> 00:50:35,728
Go home, Rudy.

477
00:50:35,858 --> 00:50:36,642
OK?

478
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,873
That fag is just fuckingwith your head, bro.

479
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:56,792
I know.

480
00:51:04,844 --> 00:51:06,889
An electrician, yes.

481
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,587
So you're the one I come
to when I feel dark.

482
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:15,855
He's safe.

483
00:51:19,467 --> 00:51:21,339
Get it?

484
00:51:22,949 --> 00:51:25,386
Ooh, a wet one.

485
00:51:25,517 --> 00:51:26,300
Yes.

486
00:51:26,431 --> 00:51:27,780
Mm.

487
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,434
Darling, fix this.

488
00:51:29,564 --> 00:51:31,740
Yes, much better.

489
00:51:31,871 --> 00:51:33,829
Well, I'm about to make anotherfew requests of our friends

490
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,266
on the outside.

491
00:51:35,396 --> 00:51:37,746
If anyone needs anything
special, now's the time.

492
00:51:37,877 --> 00:51:38,791
Don't be shy, old man.

493
00:51:41,924 --> 00:51:44,275
Is this Sergeant Hardwood?

494
00:51:44,405 --> 00:51:45,189
How are you, darling?

495
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:47,582
Guess who?

496
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:50,498
Well, um, I just need a fewmore requests if you don't mind.

497
00:51:50,629 --> 00:51:57,636
I'm feeling sort of like,well, some chocolates, Godiva--

498
00:51:57,766 --> 00:51:58,550
fucking decadent.

499
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,291
I fucking love it.

500
00:52:00,421 --> 00:52:02,075
Yeah, because-- well, I knowit's not very good on a figure.

501
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:03,294
But I have terrible sweet tooth.

502
00:52:03,424 --> 00:52:04,512
What the hell?

503
00:52:04,643 --> 00:52:06,340
You only live once.

504
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:08,734
And, uh, make sure it's the goodstuff, none of that cheap crap

505
00:52:08,864 --> 00:52:10,562
or I'll fucking Van Gogh
someone's fucking ear.

506
00:52:10,692 --> 00:52:11,389
Do you hear me?

507
00:52:14,479 --> 00:52:16,916
No requests?

508
00:52:17,046 --> 00:52:19,440
Three bottles of wine, halfpint of whiskey, and a case

509
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:20,485
of beer.

510
00:52:20,615 --> 00:52:22,400
Ooh, we're having a party.

511
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,662
Any particular brand?

512
00:52:23,792 --> 00:52:26,534
Yeah.

513
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:28,319
Enough of the games, Howard.

514
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:29,885
Your hour's up.

515
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:33,802
I"ll have to call you back.

516
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:42,028
Let's kick some serious butt.

517
00:52:43,943 --> 00:52:45,945
Excuse me.

518
00:52:46,075 --> 00:52:49,644
But I think that's
a terrible idea.

519
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:51,559
Maybe ought to stop thinking.

520
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:54,475
Start taking notes.

521
00:52:54,606 --> 00:52:57,609
Yeah, maybe.

522
00:52:57,739 --> 00:53:00,481
Maybe his ass.

523
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:12,189
I saw him moving
through the promenade.

524
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,755
Have a ball, fellows.

525
00:55:16,704 --> 00:55:18,053
What?

526
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:19,577
What the hell is that?

527
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:24,495
Where'd that come from?

528
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:07,734
Welcome to the Alamo, boys.

529
01:00:07,865 --> 01:00:09,214
We're fucked.

530
01:00:09,344 --> 01:00:11,695
Howard's rigged thewhole damn mall the blow.

531
01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:15,002
This shit's all over the place.

532
01:00:15,133 --> 01:00:16,787
How are we going
to get out of here?

533
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:18,136
Maybe we're not.

534
01:00:21,095 --> 01:00:23,054
Dose somebody got a quarter?

535
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:39,505
Bruce fucking Lee!

536
01:01:32,036 --> 01:01:33,385
I just want you
to know one thing.

537
01:01:36,518 --> 01:01:39,434
I love you.

538
01:01:39,565 --> 01:01:45,614
And I have never, ever,
ever stopped loving you.

539
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:48,052
And I never, ever will.

540
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:57,148
Hey, now, calm down, baby.

541
01:01:57,278 --> 01:01:58,627
Calm down, will you?

542
01:02:02,196 --> 01:02:03,545
What's the matter, huh?

543
01:02:06,635 --> 01:02:08,507
What's the matter, baby?

544
01:02:08,637 --> 01:02:11,162
I want you to get thesepeople out of here, Billy.

545
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:12,337
We're running out of time.

546
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:51,931
Who the fuck are you?

547
01:04:55,282 --> 01:04:55,979
Nobody.

548
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:00,635
Well, you've got
to be somebody.

549
01:05:07,468 --> 01:05:08,208
Joe's my brother.

550
01:05:16,173 --> 01:05:18,958
It's your movie, soldier.

551
01:05:24,398 --> 01:05:26,487
I ain't looking forward tospending the rest of my life

552
01:05:26,618 --> 01:05:27,532
in no cage, mister.

553
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:18,800
Oh, shit!

554
01:06:18,931 --> 01:06:21,020
No shit.

555
01:06:26,373 --> 01:06:26,983
Hurry up!

556
01:08:09,911 --> 01:08:10,782
What's the matter, baby?

557
01:08:25,927 --> 01:08:27,190
Who's the bad baby?

558
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,104
Who's the bad?

559
01:09:18,502 --> 01:09:19,372
Ow!

560
01:09:19,503 --> 01:09:21,940
God!

561
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:23,420
What you doing, Howard?

562
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:24,725
Leaving without me?

563
01:09:24,856 --> 01:09:25,987
Of course not, Joe,
for Christ's sake.

564
01:09:26,118 --> 01:09:26,814
We thought you were dead.- Shut up.

565
01:09:26,945 --> 01:09:28,120
Just shut up.

566
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:30,035
Oh, Joe, Joe.

567
01:09:38,565 --> 01:09:41,829
Joe, I know you're probablyafraid of dying here.

568
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,396
I certainly am.

569
01:09:43,527 --> 01:09:46,138
I ain't afraid of dyinghere or anywhere, Howard.

570
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:48,836
I am afraid of doing
it without you, though.

571
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,671
HOWARD: Oh, god, Joe, Joe.

572
01:10:00,848 --> 01:10:02,676
I have a little surprise.

573
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:09,683
There's a tunnel, a tunnel, Joe.

574
01:10:09,814 --> 01:10:12,817
It lead to the old stormdrains about a mile away.

575
01:13:06,164 --> 01:13:10,516
Leaving without me, Joe?

576
01:13:10,647 --> 01:13:14,477
That wasn't very nice.

577
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:55,909
Howard, old man,
pick up the phone.

578
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,911
Pick it up.

579
01:13:58,042 --> 01:14:00,392
Pick it up!

580
01:14:02,046 --> 01:14:06,703
Howard, yes, send someonedown here, please.

581
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:08,792
Howard, please--
oh, fuck you, you

582
01:14:08,922 --> 01:14:10,402
fucking-- put that on the line.

583
01:14:10,533 --> 01:14:11,447
I don't know who.

584
01:14:11,577 --> 01:14:12,491
Someone's trying to kill me.

585
01:14:24,242 --> 01:14:25,461
Oh, Christ, do something.

586
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:26,853
Do something.

587
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,074
I'll call you back.

588
01:14:30,204 --> 01:14:33,338
You'll be unconscious in 20seconds, dead in three minutes.

589
01:14:38,996 --> 01:14:39,736
Joe.

590
01:14:43,391 --> 01:14:44,175
Sh.

591
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:45,306
Hey, Rud.

592
01:14:45,437 --> 01:14:46,220
I'm right here.

593
01:14:52,357 --> 01:14:54,968
I should have stayed
on the bus, huh?

594
01:14:55,099 --> 01:14:57,014
RUDY: Sh.

595
01:14:57,144 --> 01:14:58,929
Hey, it's OK, all right?

596
01:14:59,059 --> 01:14:59,930
Yeah.

597
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:01,453
Yeah.

598
01:15:01,584 --> 01:15:04,325
Tell the old man
I'm sorry, yeah?

599
01:15:04,456 --> 01:15:06,763
He knows.

600
01:15:11,898 --> 01:15:14,510
I'd sure like to smoke a joint.

601
01:15:16,163 --> 01:15:19,471
I got a joint, Joe.

602
01:15:29,002 --> 01:15:30,613
Where the fuck
did you get bud?

603
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:39,883
I got it in your
glove compartment.

604
01:15:41,493 --> 01:15:42,755
You're driving my car?

605
01:15:57,117 --> 01:15:58,815
Man, I had me some
fun in that car.

606
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:05,299
How's it running, Rud?

607
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:06,692
Hey, Joe, it's fast.

608
01:16:15,483 --> 01:16:18,269
I'm here, Joe.

609
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:19,836
I ain't feeling too hot, Rud.

610
01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:27,321
I love you, Joe.

611
01:16:27,452 --> 01:16:28,845
I'll always love you.

612
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,417
I love you.

613
01:16:42,467 --> 01:16:45,470
Joe, I'm right here.

614
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:59,397
There's a kid in there.

615
01:16:59,527 --> 01:17:01,529
The state's going to kill him.

616
01:17:05,316 --> 01:17:06,534
He ain't bad, Rudy.

617
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:16,544
You set free, yeah?

618
01:17:16,675 --> 01:17:18,808
Yeah.

619
01:17:18,938 --> 01:17:20,461
You bet your ass, Joe.

620
01:17:23,073 --> 01:17:25,379
I love you, bro.

621
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:26,467
I know you do.

622
01:17:27,512 --> 01:17:28,339
I love you.

623
01:17:28,469 --> 01:17:30,907
I know you do, Joe.

624
01:17:31,037 --> 01:17:31,777
Yeah.

625
01:17:38,349 --> 01:17:41,178
Joe, Joe.

626
01:17:41,308 --> 01:17:42,527
I love you, Joe.

627
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,050
I love you.

628
01:19:00,692 --> 01:19:03,608
Hey!

629
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,393
What are you doing with
my fucking hostages?

630
01:19:44,649 --> 01:19:46,303
The party's over, pretty boy.

631
01:21:20,049 --> 01:21:20,788
Yes!

632
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,663
What did I do?

633
01:22:09,533 --> 01:22:10,534
Hold your fire!

634
01:22:10,664 --> 01:22:13,189
We've got hostages coming out.

635
01:22:15,017 --> 01:22:15,800
Come on.

636
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,193
Let's go!

637
01:22:17,323 --> 01:22:18,107
You go.

638
01:23:00,192 --> 01:23:00,976
Drop the guns.

639
01:24:03,386 --> 01:24:05,040
show up?

640
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:14,005
Everybody on the bus beenaccounted for except one,

641
01:24:14,136 --> 01:24:18,270
that kid, Billy Cobb.

642
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:21,186
You wouldn't happen to knowanything about that, would you?

643
01:24:30,195 --> 01:24:33,111
Sonny, he saw the
other one go down.

644
01:24:33,242 --> 01:24:34,982
They all been accounted for.

645
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:44,296
You know, you
never did tell me

646
01:24:44,427 --> 01:24:46,951
why you just walked in oneday, and laid down your badge,

647
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:47,908
and never come back.

648
01:24:51,042 --> 01:24:51,782
I didn't feel good.

649
01:24:58,745 --> 01:25:02,749
It didn't have anything to dowith your brother, Joe, did it?

650
01:25:08,277 --> 01:25:10,496
It had a lot to do
with my brother, Joe.

651
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:21,420
You know, Rudy, you
both ran the fast track.

652
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,382
You got off.

653
01:25:26,512 --> 01:25:27,426
And he just kept going.

654
01:25:30,603 --> 01:25:32,127
You've done everything
you could for him.

655
01:25:35,042 --> 01:25:36,087
Maybe I could have done more.
