1
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,618
Next, please.

2
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,738
Next!

3
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,498
Don't fool around

4
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,133
Okay

5
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,778
Did you hear what I said?

6
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,532
I want to document
our trip to America.

7
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,418
Next, please. Next.

8
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,209
How you doing?
Can I see your documents?

9
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,732
What is the purpose of your
visit to the United States?

10
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:33,817
Two weeks holiday.

11
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,091
Do you have
a return-trip ticket?

12
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,178
Excuse me. No photography
in the F.I.S. area.

13
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,418
Is he travelling with you?
Are you two together?

14
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,610
Yes.

15
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,016
Sir, come on up. Join us.

16
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,054
Is there a problem?

17
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,809
No. If you're together
I want to talk to you together.

18
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,012
-Can I see your documents?
-Sure.

19
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,655
Passport, please.
Are you related?

20
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,011
Yes. He's my friend.

21
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,975
You're a Czech national
and you're a Russian national.

22
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,092
How do you know one another?

23
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,735
We know each other from Prague.

24
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,535
-How long are you staying?
-Two weeks.

25
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,459
I'd like him to answer
for himself.

26
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,299
But he doesn't speak English.

27
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,208
No, sir.
I speakvery good English.

28
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,735
I'm here for movies.

29
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,250
For movies?
I don't understand.

30
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,214
When I was a boy,
I've seen at my school...

31
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,811
movie called
"It's Wonderful Life..."

32
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,898
directed by Frank Capra...

33
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,332
and ever since I just want
to come to United States...

34
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,055
Iand of the free,
home of the brave...

35
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,616
a country where anyone
can be anything.

36
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,414
Bullshit!

37
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,133
"Abandoned baby
in Times Square."

38
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,138
Come on,
it's too fucking soft.

39
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,413
It won't work,
and it won't get the numbers.

40
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,010
Are you suggesting that
we manufacture bad news?

41
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,052
It's what they tune us infor.

42
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,968
We're a tabloid show.
They tune infor rough stuff.

43
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,819
The net work's up
my pretty little ass to change.

44
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,171
Every lobbyist, mom,
and politician...

45
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,848
is screaming about
violence in prime time.

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,528
We've got to broaden the format.

47
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,459
Broaden the format.

48
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,413
The story they will run
is the one with the juice.

49
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,213
They want ratings
as much as I do.

50
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,049
If it bleeds, it leads.
What have you got?

51
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,899
Ride-along with Eddie Flemming.

52
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,489
-Fuck, again?!
-Cover of "People."

53
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,851
He is not new.

54
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,450
Eddie's a dear friend,
but we've done him to death.

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,776
No, this is good.

56
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,209
The psychiatrist
goes to trial tomorrow.

57
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,616
The ratings'll hit the roof.
What's Eddie doing?

58
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,334
He's staking out
a Jamaican serial killer.

59
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,690
That's good.

60
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,177
I don't want blood and guts!
Broaden the format!

61
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,009
I know they brought you in
to be the journalism cop--

62
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,451
-Excuse me!
-You're killing my show!

63
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,289
Don't forget,
Eddie's always good TV.

64
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,014
Not when he's drunk.

65
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,416
He's got a new cure for that.

66
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,291
-When?
-Tomorrow at lunch.

67
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,378
Ready, set.

68
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,778
Let's go.

69
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,698
Thrill of the hunt.

70
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,335
Look, Times square.
Just like the movies!

71
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,053
Don't speak Russian!

72
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,099
Why do I always have to
Speak to you in Czech?

73
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,339
Because I don't like your
ugly language, okay?

74
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,578
Taxi!

75
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,136
"Fuji colour...

76
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,174
"adjustable shutter speed...

77
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,612
"nightvision, infrared...

78
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,970
"black and white.

79
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,537
"Make your own movies."

80
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,810
Damn!
Watch where you're going!

81
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,499
Where'd that big guy go
with the video?

82
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,498
He stole my camera!
Stop that guy in the cab!

83
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,135
-Go! Go!
-Stop that guy in the cab!

84
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,215
Bryan,we're pulling up now.
This is important.

85
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,252
I need fresh footage for
the piece on Eddie tonight...

86
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,133
so come in fast on my signal
with the camera rolling.

87
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,138
You got it?

88
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,813
So what's Unique?

89
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,330
Not what, who. From Jamaica.

90
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,657
His girlfriend took too long
putting her make-up on.

91
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,330
They were late for a party.

92
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,169
-Stabbed her with a bottle.
-Jesus Christ.

93
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,019
That's unique. Shit.

94
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,530
He still went to the party.

95
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,728
Topfloor, back room.

96
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,454
Eddie, autograph, mon.

97
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,458
Phone number.

98
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,379
Why your picture not on this?

99
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,378
-Bounce.
-All right.

100
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,460
Yo, Unique.
5-0's on the way, bro.

101
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,253
-Cops?
-Let's go.

102
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,291
Love you too, man.

103
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,059
Who does he think Leon was?

104
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,569
It won't matter.

105
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,373
He'll hear the cops are coming
and just get out.

106
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,412
-Come on. Be quiet
-Right.

107
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,851
-Stand by.
-Standing by.

108
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,938
Eddie, are you gonna
be home tonight?

109
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,574
We're running
the Stephen Geller piece.

110
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,851
Again? You ran that fucking
thing a thousand times.

111
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,779
So what?
He's going to court tomorrow.

112
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,050
The psychiatrist's trial
is starting.

113
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,058
Ratings'll be through the roof.

114
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,455
Hey, get out.

115
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,658
Do me a favour.
Cut my interview out.

116
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,658
What for? Jesus Christ.

117
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,011
Are you getting shit
from downtown? Fuck them.

118
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,018
You're the only one
making big cases in this town.

119
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,099
I bring the big cases,
that brings the big news.

120
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,212
That stuff hurts
as much as it helps.

121
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,491
Get real jealous downtown.

122
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,010
Stay behind me.

123
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,690
Hope this fuck don't run.
My knees are killing me.

124
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,210
Be quiet. Get back.

125
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,810
Are you worried about my safety?
I'm touched.

126
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,739
Go! Get away!

127
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,057
Just keep them out of my way.

128
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,092
-You ready?
-Robert,we're ready.

129
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,451
You ready? Let's go.

130
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,858
Go on! Just get out!

131
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,290
Come on,you fucking guys!
Come in rolling!

132
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,253
What's your rush?
You going to a party?

133
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,133
What you chase me for?

134
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,457
You always leave your house
like that?

135
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,219
This not my bloody house!

136
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,174
-You live here?
-Me don't live here!

137
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,769
That sounds like
burglary to me, pal.

138
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,653
Eddie, any chance
we could get that again?

139
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,931
I didn't want to do it
in the first place.

140
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,734
Are you fucking kidding me?
Turn that fucking thing off!

141
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,852
Are you out of your mind?
Where the hell were you?

142
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,770
You two are a waste
of my goddamn life! Fuck!

143
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,410
No, Emil, get the position.

144
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,090
-What?
-First scene of my new movie.

145
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,054
Collecting our share
from the bankjob.

146
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,616
And...action.

147
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,858
Just a moment!

148
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,016
Who's there?

149
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,534
It's Emil.

150
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,258
How are you?

151
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,892
Glad to see you.

152
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,293
Olga said he didn't
know where you were.

153
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,694
If you are trying to hide,

154
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,211
You shouldn't write to her
with your return adress!

155
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,890
Beautiful necklace.

156
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,732
Effects. Video Effects.

157
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,135
It wasn't my fault
you two got caught.

158
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,649
I know.

159
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,933
Please, it's hisfault.
It's really hisfault.

160
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,859
Trying to get
the bank clerk's phone number.

161
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,619
How could I wait?

162
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,733
Hey, you didn't tell us
she was your wife!

163
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,780
That's why I didn't tell you!
Because of what you did!

164
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,171
Let'sforget all this shit!

165
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,415
Hang on. Calm down.

166
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,498
You know what?

167
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,012
Give me my money.

168
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,056
Emil,we spent it.

169
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,013
What?

170
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,894
Look at the way we live.

171
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,090
I'm a plumber.

172
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,893
Nice watch.

173
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,490
You think I'd be working
if I had money?

174
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,728
What's going on?
Just give me my money.

175
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,135
I'll helpyou.

176
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,217
You'll help me?

177
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,457
I get you a job.

178
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,537
A job?

179
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,493
The money is good.

180
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,089
A job as a plumber?

181
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,371
It's easy. It's good.

182
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,257
You think I came
to America to work?

183
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,450
No way.

184
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,970
We started over.
You can, too.

185
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,019
Emil, please.
I'm your friend.

186
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,974
I'm your friend--

187
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,455
Sorry.

188
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,052
It's my fault.
Emil, please--

189
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,492
Emil, put down the knife!

190
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,579
You spent all my money
while I was in prison?

191
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,329
You're telling me to get a job?

192
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,179
As a plumber,
fixing fucking toilets?!

193
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,291
Please, put down the knife!

194
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,696
-You're my friend!
-Yes, I am!

195
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,289
You're my best friend!

196
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,449
Please, put down the knife.
Emil, please.

197
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,457
Shut up!

198
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,538
Shut up!

199
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,092
She saw.

200
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,572
-What are you looking for?
-Her wallet, you idiot.

201
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,128
Daphne Handlova. Six-month visa.

202
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,731
Still here after two years.

203
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,932
She'll call the police.
She will!

204
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,938
She is illegal!

205
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,648
Turn that fucking
sick thing off!

206
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,330
Do as I say!

207
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,049
What are you looking for?

208
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,259
Ah, no!

209
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,170
Bohemian barbecue.

210
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,853
Man,what you got for me?

211
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,494
I don't have time
for this tonight.

212
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,089
Where the fuck you going?

213
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,258
Do yourself a favour
and get the hell outta here.

214
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,894
Gonna make me bust your ass?

215
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,217
I'm not telling you again.
This ain't a smart move.

216
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,173
Give me your fucking money--

217
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,895
You happy now?
Now you're under arrest.

218
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,137
-You the cops?
-Fire Department.

219
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,774
Firemen don't carry
no damn guns.

220
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,609
Guess again.
I'm an arson investigator.

221
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,856
We do everything cops do.

222
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,609
Yo, man, come on!

223
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,493
All right,
we're getting up on three.

224
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,895
One, two, three.

225
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,410
Why don't you
let a brother off, man?

226
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,055
No harm, nofoul.
My bad, dawg.

227
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,377
What's up, man? Come on!

228
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,892
-Put your hand up there.
-What you gonna do?

229
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,296
-Where you going?
-To a fire.

230
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,856
-Hell, no!
-I'll send a cop back!

231
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,415
Oh, hell, mother fucker!

232
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,135
You can't leave me hand cuffed
to no goddamn tree!

233
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,094
Some freak'll come up
in here and stab me, man!

234
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,289
Make sure EMS is standing by.

235
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,219
We'll have to take
the bodies out pretty soon.

236
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,254
Let's get the fourth winches
to the front of the building.

237
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,019
Chief, you first due?

238
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,497
Yeah. I got two roasts
up on the top floor.

239
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,977
You don't have to investigate
because Homicide's here.

240
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,899
Homicide?
Who said they could go up there?

241
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,409
I didn't make this
a crime scene yet.

242
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,420
-It's Eddie Flemming.
-Fuck him.

243
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,418
Jordy, where you been?
We got a celebrity.

244
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,135
I heard.
Who the hell let him up there?

245
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,979
Don't know. Think Eddie'll
give me his autograph?

246
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,978
Maybe he'll give you
a kiss, too.

247
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,298
-Hey, Cap.
-Bobby.

248
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,253
Stairs are soggy.

249
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,572
-Hey, Eddie.
-What?

250
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,533
Looks to me,
from the 69 position...

251
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,379
that they were doing each other.

252
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,775
They must've been
smoking something...

253
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,699
and were so wacked
out of their heads...

254
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,778
that they got careless,
lit up the mattress...

255
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,097
and set themselves onfire.

256
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,019
I don't know.
We got the experts here.

257
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,609
Show them what you found?

258
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,049
Hope you don't mind, guys.

259
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,250
We thought maybe
you needed some help.

260
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,770
Not at all.
Detective? Bobby Korfin.

261
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,336
-How you doing, Bobby?
-My Uncle Tony worked with you.

262
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,133
Detective,you mind
putting that cigar out?

263
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,172
-Trying to pick up a scent.
-Sorry.

264
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,692
I'm glad you guys
got it allfigured out...

265
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,175
but you mind if we go
through our routine?

266
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,212
Give us something to do.

267
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,695
We don't mind.

268
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,893
-No, certainly.
-Appreciate it.

269
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,853
-Be our guest.
-Thanks.

270
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,734
Talk about smoking after sex.

271
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,130
We got a fast-burning fire.

272
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,298
We got some good
low patterns down here.

273
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,134
-Mouth's clean.
-Clean?

274
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,172
So let me get this straight...

275
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,531
you think a couple of crackheads
burned themselves up?

276
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,254
That's what it looks like to me.

277
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,689
While they're burning up...

278
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,539
they're still going down
on one another?

279
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,174
Gotta hand it to them.

280
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,736
I guess some people have
their priorities straight.

281
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,818
I guess they do.

282
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,292
Flammable.

283
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,849
Thank you.

284
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,813
-What's that?
-Evidence.

285
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,978
Of a homicide.

286
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,930
-You know what that is?
-No,what?

287
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,052
Camello,
punch a hole in the corner.

288
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,092
I want to look at the floor.

289
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,810
They have no soot
in their mouths...

290
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,215
which means they weren't
breathing before the fire...

291
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,457
and this little piece
of cloth...

292
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,049
means they were doused
in a flammable liquid...

293
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,331
and then positioned
like this on the bed.

294
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,133
To the untrained eye,
it looks like an accident.

295
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,490
No offence.

296
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,578
What's he looking for?

297
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,578
He's looking for a timer.

298
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,693
Here you go.
Big double homicide.

299
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,738
Good.

300
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,055
Just take some deep breaths.

301
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,889
Did you see the look
on Eddie'sface...

302
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,773
when you handed him
that timer?

303
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,256
Damn, I wish
I had a picture of him.

304
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,258
He knew all along, though.

305
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,337
What?

306
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,008
Why do you think
he was so quiet?

307
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,779
He was testing us.

308
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,778
You think so?

309
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,088
Detective,
does it look like a murder?

310
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,258
We haven't determined
the exact cause of death yet.

311
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,371
There's a lot of answers
we still haven't got.

312
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,936
-How many victims?
-Two bodies.

313
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,132
-Have you identified them?
-Not positively.

314
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,535
Is it drug-related?

315
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,733
We don't know the cause
of the fire or the deaths.

316
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,932
We get them all,
we'll let you know.

317
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,972
What's this in your hand?
Evidence?

318
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,614
This is something
we found on the scene.

319
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,051
Whether it's evidence or not
has yet to be determined.

320
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,979
-Thank you, Detective.
-You're welcome.

321
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,457
See you.

322
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,055
Do you see her?

323
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,933
Who?

324
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,496
There was a woman in the crowd.
She looked scared.

325
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,896
Looked like
she wanted to talk to us.

326
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,693
Shit.

327
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,378
Get a blanket.

328
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,936
Now here you come.
It's about fucking time.

329
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,415
What the hell happened to you?

330
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,851
She stripped me, man.
A bag lady.

331
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,289
Stripped all my clothes off.

332
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,810
Grabbing me in my nuts.
It was disgusting.

333
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,410
Consider yourself lucky.
I won't lock you up.

334
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,134
You're free to go.
Get the hell outta here.

335
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,854
A dog pissed on me, man!

336
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,619
You violated my civil rights.

337
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,210
We got you for robbery one.
Take a walk.

338
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,174
So, before you slept with her...

339
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,929
with your own son's wife...

340
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,814
did you take even a second to
think about the consequences?

341
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,899
I take full responsibility
for sleeping with her.

342
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,853
I had very low self-esteem.

343
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,815
I had to compete with somebody.
It happened to be my son.

344
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,979
You're blaming this
on low self-esteem?

345
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,773
I had a lot of
behavioural disorders.

346
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,972
A behavioural disorder
and low self-esteem...

347
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,648
makes you have sex
with your son's wife?

348
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,328
It's not all hisfault.

349
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,578
No, that's true.
What about your wife?

350
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,773
He's ignored me for months.
I had no one around.

351
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,017
I didn't think that
he loved me anymore.

352
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,254
How could somebody
who loved somebody do that?

353
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,418
That's the lowest thing
you could ever possibly do.

354
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,169
"Self-esteem."

355
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,296
"Low self-esteem."

356
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,810
Turn off the camera.

357
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,374
I'm not filming anything.

358
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,576
Turn off the fucking camera!

359
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,253
I'm watching Milos die.

360
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,010
Turn it off!

361
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,696
Let go.

362
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,899
Don't break it! Don't break it!

363
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,415
How do you erase it?

364
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,410
I'll do it! I'll do it!

365
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,456
Get rid of it!

366
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,853
Don't speak to me in Russian.

367
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,768
You got it?

368
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,329
Erase it! Erase it now!

369
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,577
Just erase it!

370
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,339
Daphne Handlova.

371
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,699
What's this?

372
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,819
"Worldly Escorts."

373
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,171
"Worldly." What is it?

374
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,618
What is it?

375
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,095
I'm serious.
Get on your knees.

376
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,499
Look me in the eyes
and tell me you're sorry.

377
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,612
Let me see if I believe you.

378
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,254
I'm very sorry
for what I've done.

379
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,099
I promise
I'll never do it again.

380
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,258
How come we don't believe you?

381
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,416
Are you looking
for companionship?

382
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,532
Yes. I'm homesick.

383
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,019
I can set you up
with a realfine date.

384
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,576
Do you have Eastern European
girl, Czech girl?

385
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,136
-Of course.
-Askfor Russian girl.

386
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,140
Whatever you want.
As a matter off act...

387
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,890
I have a lovely
Czech girl right here.

388
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,808
Send her. I take her.

389
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,579
What's your address?

390
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,739
-Can you forgive him?
-Give me a hug.

391
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,454
Wait a minute. Hold on.

392
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,770
That's a good start there.

393
00:24:58,366 --> 00:24:59,401
Now that you know Eddie,
maybe he'll put you...

394
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:01,165
in the next movie about him.

395
00:25:01,606 --> 00:25:02,243
You think so?

396
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:04,358
You can play his wife.

397
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:08,800
What's up, Chief?

398
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:10,804
What the hell is that?

399
00:25:11,246 --> 00:25:13,362
What is that in your hand?
Evidence?

400
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:14,682
This is something
we found on the scene.

401
00:25:15,126 --> 00:25:16,923
Whether it's evidence or not,
we're not sure.

402
00:25:17,366 --> 00:25:19,926
You gave Eddie Flemming
the evidence?

403
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:21,594
Who did cause and origin?

404
00:25:22,046 --> 00:25:23,764
Chief,who do you think did?
We did.

405
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:26,117
Then why didn't you
talk to the reporter?

406
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,079
Because we got more
important things to do...

407
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,039
Iike finding out who did it.

408
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:32,044
Really?

409
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:37,079
Don't you guys understand?

410
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:38,754
It is all about image.

411
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:42,118
The better we look,
the more money I get to pay you.

412
00:25:55,966 --> 00:25:57,399
Good evening.
I'm Robert Hawkins...

413
00:25:57,846 --> 00:25:59,438
and this is "Top Story."

414
00:25:59,886 --> 00:26:02,002
Tonight we have an exclusive
interview with Stephen Geller...

415
00:26:02,446 --> 00:26:03,640
who horrified the nation
two years ago...

416
00:26:04,086 --> 00:26:07,442
when he murdered three clerks
in a Manhattan shoe store.

417
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:09,558
But now, Mr Geller's claim...

418
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:11,883
spoken softly
and articulately...

419
00:26:12,326 --> 00:26:14,920
is that he is the victim.

420
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,721
Hard to believe. Watch.

421
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:21,762
These people died...

422
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,481
because of the criminal actions
of my psychiatrist.

423
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:26,757
He didn't insist
that I stay on my medication.

424
00:26:27,206 --> 00:26:29,720
So you feel absolutely
no responsibility...

425
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:31,076
for killing these people?

426
00:26:31,526 --> 00:26:33,835
It was my finger
that pulled the trigger...

427
00:26:34,286 --> 00:26:36,516
but morally,
I'm not responsible.

428
00:26:36,966 --> 00:26:39,082
My psychiatrist
knew what I was capable of.

429
00:26:39,526 --> 00:26:40,641
How can I know?
I'm not a doctor.

430
00:26:41,086 --> 00:26:43,156
That seems very savvy
for a man who's beenfound...

431
00:26:43,606 --> 00:26:44,925
mentally incompetent
to stand trial.

432
00:26:45,366 --> 00:26:46,845
I'm a victim here, too.

433
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:49,242
My life has been
permanently disrupted.

434
00:26:49,686 --> 00:26:50,801
Permanently disrupted?

435
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:52,759
Hasn't this "incident,"
as you call it...

436
00:26:53,206 --> 00:26:54,719
jump-started your career
as an artist?

437
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:56,758
Isn't there a movie
in the works?

438
00:26:57,206 --> 00:26:59,117
We're in negotiations.
That's correct.

439
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:02,319
Doesn't the "Son of Sam" Iaw
prohibit convicted criminals...

440
00:27:02,766 --> 00:27:03,721
from profiting
from their crimes?

441
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:06,441
It doesn't apply to me
because I'm not a criminal.

442
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:09,275
I wasn't convicted.

443
00:27:09,726 --> 00:27:12,604
I wasfound to be
temporarily insane.

444
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:15,765
I love America.

445
00:27:16,206 --> 00:27:19,164
No one is responsible
for what they do.

446
00:27:22,526 --> 00:27:24,756
-Get in the bathroom.
-We'll fuck her first.

447
00:27:25,206 --> 00:27:26,798
-Get in.
-Fuck her first, right?

448
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:29,362
Stay there! Shut up!

449
00:27:40,246 --> 00:27:43,079
I'm Honey
from Worldly Escorts.

450
00:27:43,526 --> 00:27:45,244
You called us?

451
00:27:45,686 --> 00:27:48,154
And how are you tonight?

452
00:27:48,606 --> 00:27:50,676
Where's the Czech girl?

453
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:52,639
Baby, I'm whatever
you want me to be.

454
00:27:53,086 --> 00:27:58,080
I'm a little schoolgirl,
I'm Mommy, I'm a Czech girl.

455
00:27:58,526 --> 00:27:59,879
Now, I like to get business
out of the way...

456
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:01,202
before we get down
to pleasure...

457
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,955
so can you put the money
on the dresser?

458
00:28:04,406 --> 00:28:07,159
But I need the Czech girl.

459
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:09,437
Daphne. You know her?

460
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:12,320
It's an outcall service
run from a loft.

461
00:28:12,766 --> 00:28:14,438
I don't know the other girls.

462
00:28:14,886 --> 00:28:16,035
Aren't you getting undressed?

463
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,236
Where's the escort service?

464
00:28:17,686 --> 00:28:19,005
That's confidential.

465
00:28:19,446 --> 00:28:21,835
Can you put the money
on the dresser, please?

466
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:23,958
Yes. Sure.

467
00:28:24,406 --> 00:28:25,725
Thank you.

468
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:38,525
I'd like to talkwith the person
who runs the service.

469
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:40,240
Can you give me her address?

470
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:44,281
Do we have a problem here?

471
00:28:44,726 --> 00:28:48,560
Good. There's no reasonfor us
to have a problem.

472
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:54,677
I'm gonna make you
feel real good.

473
00:28:57,806 --> 00:28:59,956
Sorry, no smoking.

474
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:04,997
When I'm through with you...

475
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:09,075
you won't even remember
the Czech girl.

476
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:14,200
Listen to me.

477
00:29:16,726 --> 00:29:18,444
I don't want sex.

478
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:22,877
Just give me the address,
please.

479
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:26,045
Look, I don't give a shit
if you want sex or not...

480
00:29:26,486 --> 00:29:27,362
but you're paying for my time.

481
00:29:27,806 --> 00:29:28,761
Just listen to me.

482
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:32,403
Give me the address,
and then you can go.

483
00:29:32,846 --> 00:29:35,565
What are you doing?

484
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:37,758
Listen to me.
You got to help me!

485
00:29:38,206 --> 00:29:40,162
Just calm down
and listen to me.

486
00:29:40,606 --> 00:29:42,995
Give me the fucking address,
and then you go!

487
00:29:43,446 --> 00:29:45,880
Please,you got to help me.

488
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,805
I need your help!

489
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:58,516
All right! OK!

490
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,718
It's in my purse. No!

491
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,724
Shit! God!

492
00:30:05,806 --> 00:30:07,603
Help me!

493
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:09,562
No! Help me!

494
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:13,123
No! God! Someone!
Please help!

495
00:30:17,966 --> 00:30:19,604
No! Help!

496
00:30:37,686 --> 00:30:40,075
What really stood out
about this girl were her eyes.

497
00:30:40,526 --> 00:30:43,882
She had the most amazing huge
blue eyes you've ever seen.

498
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:47,318
Just absolutely beautiful.

499
00:30:47,766 --> 00:30:48,915
How long they been
living in your building?

500
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:51,482
Fouryears.

501
00:30:51,926 --> 00:30:53,882
I'll give you a call as soon
as we know something more.

502
00:30:54,326 --> 00:30:57,284
-What do you got?
-Milos and Tamina Karlova.

503
00:30:57,726 --> 00:30:59,000
They were quiet
and kept to themselves.

504
00:30:59,446 --> 00:31:01,243
Landlord don't know
who your girl is.

505
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,004
OK if I smoke?

506
00:31:48,326 --> 00:31:49,998
It's your crime scene now.

507
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:51,640
Do whateveryou want.

508
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:54,281
Did you watch the news?

509
00:31:54,726 --> 00:31:56,523
I must have missed it.

510
00:31:57,566 --> 00:31:59,397
Just so you know...

511
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:02,682
I gave you guys all the credit.

512
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:05,356
Well,just so you know...

513
00:32:05,806 --> 00:32:08,161
I don't really care
about that stuff.

514
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:10,722
Why should you?

515
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,884
I don't even watch TV.

516
00:32:13,326 --> 00:32:16,875
Good. Good.
That's commendable.

517
00:32:20,726 --> 00:32:22,239
You get a report from the M.E.?

518
00:32:22,686 --> 00:32:24,756
Sure did.

519
00:32:26,006 --> 00:32:27,962
I want to ask you something.

520
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:29,839
You got a problem with me?

521
00:32:30,286 --> 00:32:33,562
If you showed up and found me
stepping on your crime scene...

522
00:32:34,006 --> 00:32:36,076
and remember, it was
my crime scene yesterday...

523
00:32:36,526 --> 00:32:38,084
it might piss you off, too.

524
00:32:42,046 --> 00:32:43,274
What about the report?

525
00:32:43,726 --> 00:32:45,876
You were right.
Both dead before the fire.

526
00:32:46,326 --> 00:32:47,395
The man was stabbed so hard...

527
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:49,916
the killer broke off the tip
of the knife in his spine.

528
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:52,800
That usually indicates
something pretty personal.

529
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:06,558
Super said
he's seen her before...

530
00:33:07,006 --> 00:33:09,839
but she didn't live here.

531
00:33:11,086 --> 00:33:12,724
Prettiest suspect
I've had in a while.

532
00:33:13,166 --> 00:33:15,805
I don't know if she has
anything to do with this.

533
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:17,918
I saw her outside
after the fire...

534
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:19,355
and thought maybe
it was a lead.

535
00:33:19,806 --> 00:33:20,955
Thought maybe
she saw something.

536
00:33:21,406 --> 00:33:24,284
Why would they
have taken the trouble...

537
00:33:26,686 --> 00:33:29,120
to position the bodies
like that?

538
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:32,796
Maybe they're trying
to send somebody a message.

539
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:35,919
Burial rites are very serious
in Eastern Europe.

540
00:33:36,366 --> 00:33:37,242
Could be to humiliate them.

541
00:33:37,686 --> 00:33:38,914
How do you know all this?

542
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:41,322
My folks were from Poland.

543
00:33:48,206 --> 00:33:49,400
Where?

544
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:50,756
You sure it was a knife?

545
00:33:51,206 --> 00:33:53,356
Really?

546
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:58,884
There was another murder on...

547
00:33:59,326 --> 00:34:00,998
8th Avenue in a hotel.

548
00:34:01,446 --> 00:34:02,879
A stabbing.

549
00:34:03,326 --> 00:34:05,362
Clerk said
a Russian rented the room.

550
00:34:05,806 --> 00:34:07,956
Mind if I go along with you?

551
00:34:08,406 --> 00:34:11,159
This isn't afire.
There's nothing foryou to do.

552
00:34:11,606 --> 00:34:13,836
I'll watch you.
Maybe I'll learn something.

553
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:15,435
This isn't
homicide school, kid.

554
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:18,605
But if you want to help,
take that.

555
00:34:19,046 --> 00:34:20,274
What's this?

556
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,921
The matching set
for the murder weapon.

557
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,877
This is our second day
in America.

558
00:34:31,326 --> 00:34:32,918
First day was very exciting...

559
00:34:33,366 --> 00:34:35,118
full of thrills and chills.

560
00:34:35,566 --> 00:34:38,876
Over here is the co-star
of my new movie.

561
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:41,203
My partner Emil.

562
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,796
Who's this?

563
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:45,884
That is New York'sfinest.

564
00:34:46,326 --> 00:34:48,123
That's his case.

565
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:52,840
Is that all you want?

566
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:56,562
Do you know how much killer
getsfor movie rights?

567
00:34:57,006 --> 00:34:58,121
It says in there
he wants a million.

568
00:34:58,566 --> 00:35:00,124
A million?

569
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:01,715
You're kidding.

570
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:05,476
The killer gets million dollars
for television interview?

571
00:35:05,926 --> 00:35:07,996
It pays to be a killer
in this country.

572
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:15,959
-Just taking a bath.
-Any ID?

573
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,239
-P.D. only.
-He's OK.

574
00:35:19,686 --> 00:35:20,755
We still got
to run some prints.

575
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:24,755
This kid here from Midtown
caught the case.

576
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,356
How you doing?
Tommy Cullen.

577
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:28,921
It's a pleasure
tofinally meet you.

578
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:31,561
This is what we got.
Figure she's a prostitute.

579
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:34,201
Judging from the defence wounds
on her arms and hands...

580
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:36,125
she was really fighting
for her life.

581
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:40,320
The room was registered
to a Frank Capra.

582
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:43,280
-Who said this guy's Russian?
-The clerk.

583
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:45,478
Check the switchboard.
See what calls went out.

584
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:47,439
I'm on it.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

585
00:35:47,886 --> 00:35:50,161
We're waiting on the M.E.
tofind out if she was raped.

586
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,595
We got a shitload
of prints here...

587
00:35:52,046 --> 00:35:53,479
but in this joint,
they could be anybody's.

588
00:35:53,926 --> 00:35:59,159
Anybody take a piss lately?
Check the toilet seat.

589
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:02,200
Only one guy checked in?

590
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:11,644
You want to go
to homicide school?

591
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,485
Let me show you something.

592
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:16,394
The killer was standing
over there, slashing her.

593
00:36:16,846 --> 00:36:18,325
At the point of death,
the heart stops beating...

594
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:21,121
so you don't bleed anymore.
See these two marks?

595
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:25,844
Somebody was over here while
the killer was stabbing her.

596
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:28,675
What kind of knife you think
we're talking about here?

597
00:36:29,126 --> 00:36:32,914
If you look at the marks
on the wall over here...

598
00:36:33,366 --> 00:36:35,243
they're wide,
but notvery deep.

599
00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:38,120
This was not your everyday
kitchen or pocketknife.

600
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:39,794
What if the tipwas broken off?

601
00:36:40,246 --> 00:36:42,077
Could be. Then we'd probably
find it somewhere.

602
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:43,675
I thinkwe already found it.

603
00:36:44,126 --> 00:36:47,323
There was only one phone call
made last night.

604
00:36:47,766 --> 00:36:49,165
I dialled it,
and it was an escort service.

605
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:52,439
-You identify yourself?
-I'm new, not stupid.

606
00:36:52,886 --> 00:36:55,639
Call communications.
Get an address on that number.

607
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:01,326
-Good work.
-Thanks.

608
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:03,245
So you gonna head over
to the escort service?

609
00:37:03,686 --> 00:37:05,517
I'll let you know what happens.

610
00:37:05,966 --> 00:37:07,922
Eddie, you the man, bro!

611
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:09,401
Eddie, this is ridiculous.

612
00:37:09,846 --> 00:37:12,314
If I ride along with you,
we could talk over the case.

613
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:14,996
Tell you what.
I'll bounce this coin.

614
00:37:15,446 --> 00:37:16,561
If you win,you come with me.

615
00:37:17,006 --> 00:37:17,722
If you don't win,
you don't come with me.

616
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:19,440
Fair enough?

617
00:37:19,886 --> 00:37:21,524
All right, but I call it.

618
00:37:21,966 --> 00:37:23,524
You call it.

619
00:37:26,966 --> 00:37:28,718
-Tails.
-Heads. You lose.

620
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,964
That's bullshit.
I didn't get to see.

621
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:34,158
Go ahead. I'll call it.

622
00:37:34,606 --> 00:37:38,076
Heads.
See? You lost twice.

623
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:43,083
See you around.

624
00:37:44,646 --> 00:37:46,159
Come on.

625
00:37:46,606 --> 00:37:48,358
All right.

626
00:37:58,646 --> 00:37:59,840
That supposed to be funny?

627
00:38:00,286 --> 00:38:02,675
Yeah, come on.

628
00:38:04,606 --> 00:38:05,402
I was just joking.

629
00:38:05,846 --> 00:38:06,961
Thanks for letting me
come along.

630
00:38:07,606 --> 00:38:09,164
No problem. Souvenir.

631
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:12,358
Two heads.

632
00:38:12,806 --> 00:38:13,716
Better than one.

633
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,634
Police. We just want to
ask you some questions.

634
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:17,916
Do you have a warrant?

635
00:38:18,366 --> 00:38:19,799
We're not looking
to bust you, ma'am.

636
00:38:20,246 --> 00:38:21,918
It's Detective Eddie Flemming
from Homicide.

637
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:24,357
Just open the door.
We want to talk.

638
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:26,364
My God,what an honour.

639
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:28,876
Rose Hearn.
Please come in.

640
00:38:29,326 --> 00:38:32,159
I just saw you on television.

641
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:35,040
You look better in real life.

642
00:38:35,486 --> 00:38:37,397
Just give me one second.

643
00:38:46,966 --> 00:38:49,355
So,what can I help
you with, Detective?

644
00:38:49,806 --> 00:38:51,000
We don't have any ID yet...

645
00:38:51,446 --> 00:38:53,721
but we found one of your girls
at the King Edward Hotel.

646
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,316
What?

647
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:58,040
Did you send anybody over there?

648
00:38:58,486 --> 00:39:01,762
Yeah. Honey.

649
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,925
She's one of my girls.
She's dead?

650
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:05,957
I'm afraid so.

651
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:07,964
Oh, my God.

652
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:10,237
Are you all right?

653
00:39:10,686 --> 00:39:12,358
-Do you want some water?
-Please.

654
00:39:12,806 --> 00:39:14,285
Get some water, please.

655
00:39:14,726 --> 00:39:15,522
Do you know
what she was doing there?

656
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:18,878
She was on a date
with a guy.

657
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:21,715
He called asking for
a Czechoslovakian girl.

658
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:23,394
I sent him Honey.

659
00:39:23,846 --> 00:39:25,723
Once they get there,
it doesn't really matter.

660
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:26,837
Do you have Czech girls
working for you?

661
00:39:27,286 --> 00:39:31,359
No, but he insisted on one.

662
00:39:31,806 --> 00:39:34,081
Does this girl
look familiar to you?

663
00:39:38,046 --> 00:39:39,604
Linda?

664
00:39:46,206 --> 00:39:47,241
What were you saying?

665
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:50,246
I think I know this girl.
Her name is Daphne.

666
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:51,596
She's a Czech girl.

667
00:39:52,046 --> 00:39:53,365
I tried to recruit her
and gave her my card.

668
00:39:53,806 --> 00:39:57,037
I never heard backfrom her.
She's very popular suddenly.

669
00:39:57,486 --> 00:39:58,441
Do you have a last name?

670
00:39:58,886 --> 00:40:03,676
No. I just had two guys come in
asking about her.

671
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:05,241
Who were they?

672
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:09,076
One guy said he was her cousin
was trying tofind her.

673
00:40:09,526 --> 00:40:12,438
They had a video camera,
and I wanted them out...

674
00:40:12,886 --> 00:40:13,841
so I told them where she worked.

675
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:14,923
Where's that?

676
00:40:15,366 --> 00:40:16,845
It's a salon
on 63rd and Madison.

677
00:40:17,286 --> 00:40:21,040
-What's the name?
-Ludwig's. She washes hair.

678
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:26,558
Leon, Ludwig's Hair Salon.
Suspects might be there.

679
00:40:27,006 --> 00:40:28,155
We think
the suspects are there.

680
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:29,243
-Right away!
-Hurry!

681
00:40:29,686 --> 00:40:30,801
Want a sip?

682
00:40:31,246 --> 00:40:33,316
-I'm on duty.
-So am l.

683
00:40:52,246 --> 00:40:53,804
Hunting for Daphne.

684
00:40:57,406 --> 00:40:58,998
I'll go inside.
You cover the exit.

685
00:40:59,446 --> 00:41:00,276
Of course.

686
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:02,762
I always wanted to be a cop...

687
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:04,355
when I was a kid.

688
00:41:04,806 --> 00:41:06,239
I dreamt about
pulling out my gun...

689
00:41:06,686 --> 00:41:08,961
kicking the door in,
yelling "Freeze"!

690
00:41:10,766 --> 00:41:11,881
What did you dream about?

691
00:41:12,326 --> 00:41:14,237
Running into a burning building,
kicking down the door...

692
00:41:14,686 --> 00:41:16,597
rushing through the smoke,
and saving a kid.

693
00:41:17,046 --> 00:41:19,241
Then I guess we're doing it
the right way.

694
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,325
If it was a burning building,
I'd let you gofirst.

695
00:41:23,766 --> 00:41:25,040
Watch out.

696
00:41:27,326 --> 00:41:28,520
Fuck.

697
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:31,161
The thrill of the hunt.

698
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:38,563
Excuse me.

699
00:41:39,006 --> 00:41:40,075
Sorry.

700
00:41:40,526 --> 00:41:41,436
I'm looking for Daphne.

701
00:41:41,886 --> 00:41:44,400
I don't know where she went.
Maybe infront.

702
00:41:44,846 --> 00:41:46,279
Thanks.

703
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,044
I've got a temper.

704
00:42:13,486 --> 00:42:15,795
When I lose it,
I lose control.

705
00:42:16,246 --> 00:42:18,840
Get out of here!

706
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,844
I didn't intend to kill Milos.

707
00:42:21,286 --> 00:42:24,244
When I went to prison,
they beat me.

708
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:27,598
I still didn't tell
he was my partner.

709
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,276
I loved Milos like a brother.

710
00:42:31,686 --> 00:42:34,484
Daphne,will you
be coming back to work?

711
00:42:34,926 --> 00:42:37,360
-In a minute, Ludwig.
-Come!

712
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:40,036
Thank you.

713
00:42:40,486 --> 00:42:42,716
I don't want to kill you.

714
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:45,600
But if you talk...

715
00:42:46,046 --> 00:42:48,196
I will.

716
00:42:51,886 --> 00:42:55,003
I thought you'd want it.

717
00:42:55,446 --> 00:42:57,038
This was Tamina's necklace.

718
00:42:57,486 --> 00:42:59,442
Keep it.

719
00:43:02,566 --> 00:43:04,124
Let's get out of here.

720
00:43:09,246 --> 00:43:10,804
Good-bye, my love.

721
00:43:26,126 --> 00:43:27,878
Your name's Daphne, right?

722
00:43:28,326 --> 00:43:30,635
Remember last night at the fire,
you saw me?

723
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:33,122
Last night,you wanted
to tell me something.

724
00:43:33,566 --> 00:43:35,716
I got it.
I smell smoke across the street.

725
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:36,962
We just want to talk to you.

726
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:39,601
We're here to protect you.
No problem.

727
00:43:40,046 --> 00:43:41,843
You speak English?

728
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,925
You speak English, don't you?

729
00:43:45,366 --> 00:43:46,924
Let's go this way.

730
00:43:52,286 --> 00:43:54,846
Did two guys come
and visit you today?

731
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,877
What's that?
Who gave you this?

732
00:44:10,486 --> 00:44:11,965
Across the street,
two guys with a video camera.

733
00:44:12,406 --> 00:44:13,919
Don't look! It's OK.

734
00:44:14,366 --> 00:44:15,594
Let's just box them in.

735
00:44:16,046 --> 00:44:17,195
You stay here with her.

736
00:44:19,566 --> 00:44:21,397
Come on, let's go!

737
00:44:35,446 --> 00:44:38,040
Shit! Go!

738
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:43,443
Goddamn!

739
00:44:46,446 --> 00:44:47,674
Split up!

740
00:44:48,126 --> 00:44:49,957
Fuck! Go!

741
00:44:51,886 --> 00:44:54,161
Son of a bitch!

742
00:44:58,726 --> 00:45:00,876
Get the fuck out of the road!

743
00:45:08,566 --> 00:45:10,841
Move! Damn!

744
00:45:12,206 --> 00:45:13,844
On the bus!

745
00:45:24,686 --> 00:45:25,835
-Look out!
-Be careful!

746
00:45:30,286 --> 00:45:32,925
Excuse me! Move! I'm a cop!

747
00:45:50,526 --> 00:45:51,436
Look, look!

748
00:45:51,886 --> 00:45:53,285
Watch out! Watch out!

749
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:59,316
Perfect! Cut! Print! Go!

750
00:46:05,246 --> 00:46:06,520
Bobby,you OK?

751
00:46:06,966 --> 00:46:09,321
I'm all right.
They went towards the park!

752
00:46:10,526 --> 00:46:12,642
-You hit?
-No.

753
00:46:13,086 --> 00:46:16,874
Got my piece.

754
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:38,282
Did you get him?

755
00:46:40,126 --> 00:46:41,684
Think so.

756
00:46:46,606 --> 00:46:47,516
I'm here, Leon.

757
00:46:47,966 --> 00:46:49,479
I'm having a bad day, man.

758
00:46:49,926 --> 00:46:51,439
You'll be OK.

759
00:46:53,526 --> 00:46:55,164
We've surrounded the park.
They've disappeared.

760
00:46:57,126 --> 00:46:58,445
Detective, can you tell us
what happened?

761
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:00,922
-I can't talk right now.
-Give me a break.

762
00:47:01,366 --> 00:47:03,596
Excuse me,what's
the Fire Marshal doing here?

763
00:47:04,046 --> 00:47:05,365
I can't give out any statements
right now. I'm sorry.

764
00:47:05,806 --> 00:47:07,398
I understand your partner,
Leon Jackson, is injured.

765
00:47:07,846 --> 00:47:09,404
He was hurt, not seriously.

766
00:47:09,846 --> 00:47:11,120
Do you have a suspect
in custody?

767
00:47:11,566 --> 00:47:13,079
Now's not a good time, OK?

768
00:47:13,526 --> 00:47:14,083
Detective Jackson
was not hurt seriously.

769
00:47:14,526 --> 00:47:15,515
That's all I can tell you.

770
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,399
All right.
Eddie, are you all right?

771
00:47:17,846 --> 00:47:19,325
Not a good time.

772
00:47:19,766 --> 00:47:21,324
All right.

773
00:47:23,846 --> 00:47:25,598
If you'd just be willing
to cooperate...

774
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:27,399
Let me tell you something.

775
00:47:27,846 --> 00:47:30,155
I want to know who they are
and how you're involved now!

776
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:32,164
I don't know who they are.
I've never seen them before.

777
00:47:32,606 --> 00:47:35,120
I was there showering,
and Tamina is a friend of mine.

778
00:47:35,566 --> 00:47:36,601
My shower was broken,
so she let me use theirs.

779
00:47:37,046 --> 00:47:38,161
Go on.

780
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:39,880
That's it.
I saw the killings.

781
00:47:40,326 --> 00:47:41,361
Why are you protecting them?

782
00:47:41,806 --> 00:47:43,034
I'm protecting myself.

783
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:45,556
From what?
Are you here illegally?

784
00:47:46,006 --> 00:47:47,405
Don't worry about that.
We'll talk to lmmigration.

785
00:47:47,846 --> 00:47:50,155
-Don't talk to lmmigration.
-Why not?

786
00:47:50,606 --> 00:47:52,358
We'll find out
one way or another.

787
00:47:52,806 --> 00:47:55,479
Better that it comes from you.
You understand?

788
00:48:04,726 --> 00:48:05,761
You want to sit down?

789
00:48:06,206 --> 00:48:07,764
Why don't you sit down?

790
00:48:10,726 --> 00:48:12,557
You want a glass of water?

791
00:48:25,206 --> 00:48:28,278
My little sister and I
shared a flat.

792
00:48:28,726 --> 00:48:33,197
I came home one night,
and a man was raping her.

793
00:48:33,646 --> 00:48:36,683
His gun was on the chair,
and I grabbed it...

794
00:48:37,126 --> 00:48:39,959
and when he came at me,
I shot him.

795
00:48:40,406 --> 00:48:41,441
Justifiable homicide.

796
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:44,605
Yes, but he was a cop.

797
00:48:45,046 --> 00:48:48,004
So you shot him,
and you killed a cop?

798
00:48:48,446 --> 00:48:51,404
I was living in a small town
in Slovakia.

799
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:52,801
We don't want to hear
your life story.

800
00:48:53,246 --> 00:48:54,645
I got an officer
shot out there.

801
00:48:55,086 --> 00:48:56,121
Just tell us where
we can find these guys.

802
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,363
You're a cop.
I know you won't help me.

803
00:48:58,806 --> 00:49:00,956
You're right.
Not unless you help us.

804
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:05,081
Eddie, can I talk to you
alone for a second?

805
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,925
For a second.

806
00:49:13,126 --> 00:49:16,277
Even if she is telling
the truth, she's fucked.

807
00:49:16,726 --> 00:49:20,275
Would you mind letting me
talk to her first?

808
00:49:20,726 --> 00:49:22,796
Any leads I get,
they're all yours...

809
00:49:23,246 --> 00:49:25,521
but let me
get first crack at her.

810
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:28,002
You want to talk to her alone?

811
00:49:28,446 --> 00:49:29,356
She's scared.

812
00:49:29,806 --> 00:49:31,717
You're intimidating her.
Big hotshot celebrity.

813
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:34,202
I'm a nobody.
Maybe she'll open upwith me.

814
00:49:34,646 --> 00:49:35,874
Maybe she looks
at me different.

815
00:49:36,326 --> 00:49:38,681
What is this?
You're her saviour?

816
00:49:39,126 --> 00:49:41,082
Gonna save her
from the burning building?

817
00:49:41,526 --> 00:49:43,084
I'm being serious here.

818
00:49:49,046 --> 00:49:51,116
I'll give you a head start...

819
00:49:51,566 --> 00:49:52,442
but you get her
to the station house...

820
00:49:52,886 --> 00:49:53,716
and don't let her
out of your sight.

821
00:49:54,166 --> 00:49:55,440
She's the only warm body
we got left.

822
00:49:55,886 --> 00:49:57,683
I'm a professional,
all right?

823
00:49:58,126 --> 00:49:59,320
Women like that have a way...

824
00:49:59,766 --> 00:50:01,961
of turning professionals
into amateurs.

825
00:50:27,886 --> 00:50:29,365
What are you doing?

826
00:50:29,806 --> 00:50:31,637
I've got to light
this scene better.

827
00:50:32,086 --> 00:50:33,405
Make it more dramatic...

828
00:50:33,846 --> 00:50:36,406
just like in the movie,
"Silence of the Sheeps."

829
00:50:36,846 --> 00:50:38,359
Shut up.

830
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:40,364
Hurts, huh?

831
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:53,680
Big enough?
Just kidding.

832
00:50:54,126 --> 00:50:55,684
Want to get married?

833
00:50:58,926 --> 00:51:00,837
I love you.
You want to get married?

834
00:51:01,286 --> 00:51:02,241
Sweetheart.

835
00:51:02,686 --> 00:51:04,244
No?

836
00:51:05,766 --> 00:51:06,881
Come on.

837
00:51:08,206 --> 00:51:09,685
Come on.

838
00:51:25,526 --> 00:51:27,403
I love you.

839
00:51:28,646 --> 00:51:31,240
sweetheart, my love.

840
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:35,082
I adore you.

841
00:51:36,406 --> 00:51:38,840
I adore you, my Nicolette.

842
00:51:40,886 --> 00:51:42,478
I want you.

843
00:51:51,046 --> 00:51:53,321
I adore you.

844
00:51:57,326 --> 00:51:58,645
She's here.

845
00:51:59,086 --> 00:52:00,644
She's here?

846
00:52:06,526 --> 00:52:08,437
What does that mean?

847
00:52:10,846 --> 00:52:11,995
"Good luck" in Greek.

848
00:52:12,446 --> 00:52:14,437
Good luck in English.

849
00:52:18,406 --> 00:52:19,964
Are you married?

850
00:52:22,126 --> 00:52:23,878
Do you live alone?

851
00:52:25,846 --> 00:52:27,677
I haven't showered
since the killings.

852
00:52:28,126 --> 00:52:30,435
We could stop at your place,
and I could take a shower...

853
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:33,161
before we have to go back
to custody.

854
00:52:33,606 --> 00:52:35,517
Look, l...

855
00:52:35,966 --> 00:52:39,117
I can't take you
back to my place.

856
00:52:39,566 --> 00:52:41,238
Then somewhere else?

857
00:52:44,366 --> 00:52:45,924
How's it going, dude?

858
00:52:47,686 --> 00:52:50,246
-Eddie, how are you?
-Not too good.

859
00:53:01,366 --> 00:53:03,402
I love you.

860
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:05,797
You have a funny way
of showing it.

861
00:53:06,246 --> 00:53:07,645
Yeah, me, too.

862
00:53:08,086 --> 00:53:09,201
Why'd you snap at me?

863
00:53:09,646 --> 00:53:10,556
I didn't snap at you.

864
00:53:11,006 --> 00:53:13,156
Yes,you did.
I just wanted a statement.

865
00:53:13,606 --> 00:53:14,482
I just can't answeryou
every time.

866
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:16,041
I couldn't do it.

867
00:53:16,486 --> 00:53:19,284
Didn't have to embarrass me
infront of my colleagues.

868
00:53:19,726 --> 00:53:22,798
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to embarrass you.

869
00:53:23,246 --> 00:53:23,883
You know that.

870
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:25,759
It's all right.

871
00:53:28,006 --> 00:53:29,564
You OK?

872
00:53:40,046 --> 00:53:43,402
You got blood all over
your watch. Leon's?

873
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:45,916
Probably. It has to be.

874
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:50,835
Is he gonna be all right?

875
00:53:51,286 --> 00:53:53,959
He'll be OK.

876
00:53:55,526 --> 00:53:57,403
Last week,you had
that schoolteacher's blood...

877
00:53:57,846 --> 00:53:59,723
on your shoes.

878
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:03,158
I don't know how you do it.

879
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:07,155
Speaking of shoes...

880
00:54:07,606 --> 00:54:09,836
you know what I was thinking?

881
00:54:11,686 --> 00:54:15,804
I would like to have...

882
00:54:19,446 --> 00:54:21,482
some shoes next to my shoes.

883
00:54:26,206 --> 00:54:27,355
Wait.

884
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,637
What are you doing, Eddie?

885
00:54:49,246 --> 00:54:51,237
Forget the phone. What?

886
00:54:51,686 --> 00:54:53,085
No, go ahead.
Answer the phone.

887
00:54:53,526 --> 00:54:55,084
Aw, shit.

888
00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:58,599
Look, can I just
call you right back?

889
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,274
You can't call me back.
We can't find Katie.

890
00:55:00,726 --> 00:55:02,762
We want you to anchor right now.
We don't know where she is.

891
00:55:03,206 --> 00:55:04,958
Come down, get in a cab,
and be here in an hour.

892
00:55:05,406 --> 00:55:06,805
Wait a minute.
Now? Right now?

893
00:55:07,246 --> 00:55:07,962
You want your shot?

894
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:09,964
Get in the cab
and come down here now.

895
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:15,960
They want me to anchor.

896
00:55:16,406 --> 00:55:17,885
-Great.
-Tonight.

897
00:55:18,326 --> 00:55:20,396
-That's great.
-Oh, my God.

898
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:26,596
Forget that for a second.

899
00:55:27,046 --> 00:55:28,274
No,when you come back.

900
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:29,795
You promise?
We'll talk tonight?

901
00:55:30,246 --> 00:55:31,395
Of course I promise.

902
00:55:31,846 --> 00:55:33,325
I'll see you
when you come back...

903
00:55:33,766 --> 00:55:34,357
and we'll do it.

904
00:55:34,806 --> 00:55:36,034
Go ahead.
You'll be great.

905
00:55:36,486 --> 00:55:37,601
I love you, Eddie.

906
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,082
I love you, sweetheart.

907
00:55:43,726 --> 00:55:45,045
I'll see you tonight.

908
00:55:45,486 --> 00:55:47,761
Good luck.

909
00:55:48,206 --> 00:55:50,197
Don't be late.

910
00:56:27,646 --> 00:56:29,762
The video of Milos and Tamina...

911
00:56:30,206 --> 00:56:31,434
I told you to erase it.

912
00:56:31,886 --> 00:56:34,116
I erased everything.
It's all gone.

913
00:56:34,566 --> 00:56:37,239
Don't lie.
I won't be angry.

914
00:56:39,126 --> 00:56:41,321
Why not?

915
00:56:48,966 --> 00:56:51,082
-What is it?
-What does it look like?

916
00:56:51,526 --> 00:56:52,322
It's an address book.

917
00:56:52,766 --> 00:56:55,439
I took it from the black cop.

918
00:56:58,246 --> 00:56:59,520
What's this?

919
00:57:01,286 --> 00:57:03,242
What is it?

920
00:57:13,566 --> 00:57:17,923
"Eddie Flemming."

921
00:57:23,326 --> 00:57:26,204
Why won't you be angry
at me for keeping my movie?

922
00:57:29,966 --> 00:57:31,797
You'll see.

923
00:57:33,126 --> 00:57:35,686
Come. Bring the camera.

924
00:57:43,446 --> 00:57:44,595
Hello.

925
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:48,925
My name is Frank Capra.
I'm a famous Hollywood director.

926
00:57:53,686 --> 00:57:55,278
There she is!

927
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:13,519
What are you doing here?

928
00:58:13,966 --> 00:58:15,558
What am I doing here?

929
00:58:16,006 --> 00:58:17,883
I came to see how
the investigation is going.

930
00:58:18,326 --> 00:58:19,475
I called,
and you're not here.

931
00:58:19,926 --> 00:58:20,961
I waited by the station house,
you never show up.

932
00:58:21,406 --> 00:58:22,885
I beep you,
you don't return my call.

933
00:58:23,326 --> 00:58:26,363
Where the hell have you been?

934
00:58:26,806 --> 00:58:29,115
Ladder 21 was at the rock
for training. All right?

935
00:58:29,566 --> 00:58:31,204
So we stopped there so
she could get cleaned up.

936
00:58:31,646 --> 00:58:32,920
What do you mean cleaned up?

937
00:58:34,366 --> 00:58:35,276
I let her take a shower.

938
00:58:35,726 --> 00:58:38,399
A shower?
And did you take one, too?

939
00:58:38,846 --> 00:58:40,245
Come on, Chief.

940
00:58:40,686 --> 00:58:42,039
She's been through a lot.
I'm trying to help her out.

941
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:43,282
Really?
That's really nice of you.

942
00:58:43,726 --> 00:58:44,636
You take a homicide witness...

943
00:58:45,086 --> 00:58:46,565
to take a shower after
your partner's been shot.

944
00:58:47,006 --> 00:58:48,519
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

945
00:58:48,966 --> 00:58:50,240
You having that much trouble
get ting dates?

946
00:58:50,686 --> 00:58:52,404
I told him to.
Tommy, get her out of here.

947
00:58:52,846 --> 00:58:54,120
There was the press
all over the place.

948
00:58:54,566 --> 00:58:55,965
I didn't want her face
in the news, so I told him...

949
00:58:56,406 --> 00:58:57,555
to take her someplace quiet
till things calmed down.

950
00:58:58,006 --> 00:59:00,042
-Really?
-It was my decision, not his.

951
00:59:00,486 --> 00:59:01,760
I am
the Deputy Chief Fire Marshal...

952
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:04,276
and every now and then, I like
to be included in decisions.

953
00:59:04,726 --> 00:59:06,239
I understand.
Infact, once he briefs me...

954
00:59:06,686 --> 00:59:08,165
you guys can take over
the press conference...

955
00:59:08,606 --> 00:59:09,675
and you can take
the lead in the case.

956
00:59:10,126 --> 00:59:11,923
-How's that?
-All right.

957
00:59:12,366 --> 00:59:14,322
I'm ready to be briefed.

958
00:59:15,846 --> 00:59:17,359
-Excuse us.
-Sure.

959
00:59:17,806 --> 00:59:19,558
Are you ready to brief me?

960
00:59:20,006 --> 00:59:21,644
Good.

961
00:59:24,486 --> 00:59:26,363
Wait.

962
00:59:30,006 --> 00:59:31,758
Fellas, can you give us
a few minutes, please?

963
00:59:32,206 --> 00:59:34,162
-You bet.
-Thanks.

964
00:59:35,526 --> 00:59:36,322
Shut that door, too,
when you go out.

965
00:59:36,766 --> 00:59:38,324
Thanks a lot, guys.

966
00:59:39,686 --> 00:59:41,756
Just so you know,
I didn't touch her.

967
00:59:42,206 --> 00:59:43,321
Maybe you should've...

968
00:59:43,766 --> 00:59:44,881
because nobody believes
you didn't, including me.

969
00:59:45,326 --> 00:59:46,395
I know it wasn't
the smartest thing to do...

970
00:59:46,846 --> 00:59:47,961
and you think I'm a fool,
but nothing happened.

971
00:59:48,406 --> 00:59:49,475
It wasn't
the smartest thing to do.

972
00:59:49,926 --> 00:59:51,644
To say the least,
you ought to know better.

973
00:59:52,086 --> 00:59:54,475
She's got the potential
to fucking hang you.

974
00:59:54,926 --> 00:59:56,484
If she even suggests
that you made a pass at her...

975
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:57,756
it's fucking over.
Deny it all you want.

976
00:59:58,206 --> 00:59:59,605
It won't make a fucking
bit of difference.

977
01:00:00,046 --> 01:00:02,719
You never went
out on a limb for somebody?

978
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,519
"Here's the name of
an immigration lawyer."

979
01:00:04,966 --> 01:00:06,160
That's how you go out on a limb.

980
01:00:06,606 --> 01:00:07,595
If you heard her story,
you'd believe her, too.

981
01:00:08,046 --> 01:00:09,923
You'll jeopardize
your career and your life...

982
01:00:10,366 --> 01:00:11,765
and my case...

983
01:00:12,206 --> 01:00:13,798
and I'll give you
another piece of advice.

984
01:00:14,246 --> 01:00:15,076
Maybe you don't watch TV...

985
01:00:15,526 --> 01:00:17,198
but I'll let you in
on a little secret.

986
01:00:17,646 --> 01:00:19,079
The whole fucking world
watches television.

987
01:00:19,526 --> 01:00:21,403
When you go out there,
they know your face...

988
01:00:21,846 --> 01:00:24,280
and the little fucking
itty bit of fame...

989
01:00:24,726 --> 01:00:27,194
I have in this fucking city
makes my job a lot easier...

990
01:00:27,646 --> 01:00:29,557
and I get a lot more done
because of it.

991
01:00:30,006 --> 01:00:31,997
Why'd you stand up
for me with the chief?

992
01:00:36,686 --> 01:00:38,756
I don't know.

993
01:00:39,206 --> 01:00:41,037
You remind me of a puppy
I used to have...

994
01:00:41,486 --> 01:00:44,523
who pissed all over the carpet,
but I still kept him.

995
01:01:00,726 --> 01:01:02,557
-Let's go.
-Captain!

996
01:01:04,366 --> 01:01:06,197
One at a time, please!

997
01:01:06,646 --> 01:01:10,195
We're looking for two male white
suspects in their thirties.

998
01:01:10,646 --> 01:01:13,524
We believe them to be of
an Eastern-European nationality.

999
01:01:17,046 --> 01:01:18,274
That's another lesson.

1000
01:01:18,726 --> 01:01:21,035
You got nothing to say,
don't waste their time or yours.

1001
01:01:21,486 --> 01:01:23,078
Let somebody else do that.

1002
01:01:23,526 --> 01:01:24,675
What's the plan now?

1003
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:27,037
You're on the team, so I'll
call you when something happens.

1004
01:01:27,486 --> 01:01:29,078
Right now I've got to propose
to my girlfriend.

1005
01:01:29,526 --> 01:01:31,721
Really? Congratulations.

1006
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:34,521
Don't congratulate me.
She hasn't said yes yet.

1007
01:01:34,966 --> 01:01:36,445
I still think
there's something...

1008
01:01:36,886 --> 01:01:39,002
I could be doing
to helpfind these guys.

1009
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,801
Go home and get some rest.

1010
01:01:42,246 --> 01:01:43,361
Sometimes you can try too hard.

1011
01:01:43,806 --> 01:01:45,762
Sometimes you have to go away
in order to come back.

1012
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:47,798
Like you did
with that shot today?

1013
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:48,996
That's right.

1014
01:01:49,446 --> 01:01:50,765
All right. I get it.

1015
01:01:51,206 --> 01:01:53,117
Good, because you don't
look like you get it.

1016
01:01:53,566 --> 01:01:54,555
I get it.

1017
01:01:55,006 --> 01:01:56,485
-Sure you get it?
-I get it.

1018
01:01:56,926 --> 01:01:58,405
-You get it?
-No, I get it.

1019
01:01:58,846 --> 01:02:02,043
Trust me. I get it.

1020
01:02:04,606 --> 01:02:05,436
Why don't you keep it?

1021
01:02:05,886 --> 01:02:08,559
Don't say I never
gave you anything.

1022
01:03:28,206 --> 01:03:29,764
Coming.

1023
01:03:47,566 --> 01:03:49,124
Hello?

1024
01:04:29,206 --> 01:04:30,605
I'm looking for Gayle Cassiopi.

1025
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:33,924
I think it's one flight up.

1026
01:04:34,366 --> 01:04:36,402
Thanks.

1027
01:04:44,926 --> 01:04:46,484
Action.

1028
01:05:40,526 --> 01:05:41,515
Who's she?

1029
01:05:41,966 --> 01:05:43,957
None of your fucking business.

1030
01:05:48,126 --> 01:05:49,798
Who's Nicky?

1031
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:04,041
Beautiful.

1032
01:06:04,486 --> 01:06:06,044
It's OK.

1033
01:06:14,886 --> 01:06:17,844
You know what I need?
I need your opinion.

1034
01:06:18,286 --> 01:06:20,083
You do? About what?

1035
01:06:24,366 --> 01:06:26,004
You see...

1036
01:06:26,446 --> 01:06:29,802
they're going to make
a movie about me, too, Eddie...

1037
01:06:30,246 --> 01:06:31,645
and write books.

1038
01:06:32,086 --> 01:06:34,725
Write books.

1039
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:38,885
Books? What's your fucking
accomplishment?

1040
01:06:40,966 --> 01:06:45,118
I kill someone famous.

1041
01:06:46,806 --> 01:06:54,440
And I saw you on the page
of "People" magazine.

1042
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:56,239
Eddie, look at me.

1043
01:06:56,686 --> 01:06:59,678
Good.

1044
01:07:00,126 --> 01:07:02,879
Good. Be tough to the end.

1045
01:07:03,326 --> 01:07:06,318
Actor who plays you will
want you to die like a hero.

1046
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:11,524
Tabloids don't have
to do re-enactments.

1047
01:07:11,966 --> 01:07:15,515
They're going to have
a real movie this time.

1048
01:07:15,966 --> 01:07:18,526
You film killing me,
you'll get away with that?

1049
01:07:20,406 --> 01:07:21,600
You're stupider than I thought.

1050
01:07:22,046 --> 01:07:24,162
Both out of your fucking minds.

1051
01:07:28,206 --> 01:07:31,482
Turn it off!

1052
01:07:37,526 --> 01:07:39,084
We are insane.

1053
01:07:39,526 --> 01:07:44,077
Who else but crazy men
would film their crimes?

1054
01:07:44,526 --> 01:07:48,201
So I kill you,
and if we are caught...

1055
01:07:48,646 --> 01:07:49,999
we are sent
to mental hospital...

1056
01:07:50,446 --> 01:07:54,803
but once I'm in the hospital,
I say I'm not crazy...

1057
01:07:55,246 --> 01:07:57,202
just pretending.

1058
01:07:57,646 --> 01:08:00,114
So I would be acquitted.

1059
01:08:00,566 --> 01:08:02,238
We see psychiatrists.

1060
01:08:02,686 --> 01:08:05,075
They must certify we are sane...

1061
01:08:05,526 --> 01:08:08,086
and because of
your double jeopardy law...

1062
01:08:08,526 --> 01:08:10,801
we can't be tried
for the same crime twice.

1063
01:08:11,246 --> 01:08:14,955
We come out
free, rich, and famous.

1064
01:08:15,406 --> 01:08:18,682
This is a fucking great idea.

1065
01:08:19,126 --> 01:08:20,878
You think the jury
will buy that bullshit?

1066
01:08:21,326 --> 01:08:23,078
You sickfucks.

1067
01:08:40,086 --> 01:08:42,759
I'm smarter than Americans.

1068
01:08:44,206 --> 01:08:47,323
You watch crybaby talk shows
all day long.

1069
01:08:50,486 --> 01:08:55,162
Not only will Americans
believe me, they'll cry for me.

1070
01:09:03,686 --> 01:09:07,804
Would you like to say
good-bye to your Nicky?

1071
01:09:08,246 --> 01:09:11,682
Maybe you can
propose to her now.

1072
01:09:18,326 --> 01:09:20,886
He has nothing to say.

1073
01:09:21,326 --> 01:09:22,554
Give me a pillow.

1074
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,043
Give me a fucking pillow!

1075
01:09:31,886 --> 01:09:33,604
Come here, start the camera.

1076
01:09:34,046 --> 01:09:36,480
Cut!
This is my project.

1077
01:09:36,926 --> 01:09:39,121
I'm the director,
and I say action.

1078
01:09:39,566 --> 01:09:41,158
Shut the fuck up!

1079
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:34,081
Detective Flemming...

1080
01:11:34,526 --> 01:11:36,835
was one of the most
decorated NYPD detectives...

1081
01:11:37,286 --> 01:11:38,514
in the history of New York.

1082
01:11:38,966 --> 01:11:40,718
Among the several thousand
arrests he made...

1083
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:43,726
during his career,
the famed Stephen Geller case.

1084
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:46,236
He was widely loved
by the community he served.

1085
01:11:46,686 --> 01:11:48,199
His partner eulogized him.

1086
01:11:48,646 --> 01:11:50,159
Eddie was my mentor...

1087
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:53,838
My partner...

1088
01:11:54,286 --> 01:11:57,562
Tragedy.
Every great film must have one.

1089
01:11:58,006 --> 01:11:59,962
...the word "friend."

1090
01:12:01,846 --> 01:12:03,837
I will miss him.

1091
01:12:27,846 --> 01:12:28,915
I said, no!

1092
01:12:29,366 --> 01:12:31,675
No means no.
Want me to get ugly?

1093
01:12:32,126 --> 01:12:33,878
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.
It's a private affair.

1094
01:12:34,326 --> 01:12:36,760
-Sorry, no.
-Let me get a drink.

1095
01:14:08,206 --> 01:14:09,275
Please hold.

1096
01:14:09,726 --> 01:14:12,843
Just stay on. Hold on.
Robert, you've got a call.

1097
01:14:13,286 --> 01:14:14,435
What the hell
are you doing here?

1098
01:14:14,886 --> 01:14:16,638
Hold on. I'm right here.
Just stay right there.

1099
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:17,962
Don't be ridiculous.
Can't you see I'm busy here?

1100
01:14:18,406 --> 01:14:19,600
Trust me. Take this call.

1101
01:14:20,046 --> 01:14:21,001
Hang up the phone,
go get yourself a drink.

1102
01:14:21,446 --> 01:14:23,277
Take the call.

1103
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:25,159
Give it to me.

1104
01:14:26,566 --> 01:14:28,124
I'm sorry.

1105
01:14:30,606 --> 01:14:31,959
Who is this?

1106
01:14:32,406 --> 01:14:35,557
I made a movie
of Eddie Flemming's murder.

1107
01:14:39,606 --> 01:14:40,880
How do I know this is you?

1108
01:14:41,326 --> 01:14:42,520
You'll know when you meet me.

1109
01:14:42,966 --> 01:14:45,924
-Where?
-Come to 35th and Broadway.

1110
01:14:46,366 --> 01:14:47,765
Don't bring the police.
Come alone...

1111
01:14:48,206 --> 01:14:49,355
oryou'll be in my next film.

1112
01:14:49,806 --> 01:14:52,240
Listen, asshole, I've been
threatened by better than you.

1113
01:14:52,686 --> 01:14:54,756
No. I'm the best
that's ever threatened you.

1114
01:14:55,206 --> 01:14:56,275
They're gonna get you.

1115
01:14:56,726 --> 01:14:59,479
We'll talk about that.

1116
01:14:59,926 --> 01:15:01,041
About surrendering?

1117
01:15:01,486 --> 01:15:04,284
4.00. It gives you
time to go to bank.

1118
01:15:04,726 --> 01:15:07,160
$1 million.

1119
01:15:10,206 --> 01:15:12,640
"Top Story,"
are you still there?

1120
01:15:13,086 --> 01:15:14,121
I'm here.

1121
01:15:14,566 --> 01:15:15,794
It doesn't work that way.

1122
01:15:16,246 --> 01:15:18,043
If you don't want my film...

1123
01:15:18,486 --> 01:15:22,240
I'll call another show,
and they will show it.

1124
01:15:28,086 --> 01:15:29,519
I'll meet you.
I need two things from you--

1125
01:15:29,966 --> 01:15:33,276
I want exclusivity,
and you will surrender to me.

1126
01:15:35,926 --> 01:15:37,359
Bring cash.

1127
01:15:43,606 --> 01:15:45,358
Let's go.

1128
01:15:49,526 --> 01:15:51,801
Truck 21 spotted on
the north end of the building...

1129
01:15:52,246 --> 01:15:53,725
put the aerial ladder
up to the roof.

1130
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:56,202
Engine company 54
and Engine 9...

1131
01:15:56,646 --> 01:15:58,682
took hand lines
up to the second level.

1132
01:15:59,126 --> 01:16:01,594
The they cut a hole in the roof
directly over the fire.

1133
01:16:02,046 --> 01:16:04,765
-So how was the funeral?
-Not good.

1134
01:16:05,206 --> 01:16:07,083
Did the D.A.
video-tape her deposition?

1135
01:16:07,526 --> 01:16:08,800
He finished a little while ago.

1136
01:16:09,246 --> 01:16:10,315
Swing by her apartment...

1137
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:12,518
pick up her clothes,
and take her straight to INS.

1138
01:16:12,966 --> 01:16:14,797
She's their problem now.

1139
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:53,564
Hard to believe. Watch.

1140
01:17:39,926 --> 01:17:40,722
What's this?

1141
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:42,360
I don't know.

1142
01:17:44,646 --> 01:17:45,920
"Good luck with
all your troubles.

1143
01:17:46,366 --> 01:17:48,926
"I'm here if you need me.
Ludwig."

1144
01:17:51,526 --> 01:17:52,754
Who's he?

1145
01:17:53,206 --> 01:17:56,915
My boss.
Why, are you jealous?

1146
01:17:59,206 --> 01:18:01,401
Why don'twe get your stuff?

1147
01:18:28,006 --> 01:18:30,042
Look...

1148
01:18:30,486 --> 01:18:33,080
you're a witness
to a double homicide.

1149
01:18:33,526 --> 01:18:35,756
All right?
I can't get involved with you.

1150
01:18:39,046 --> 01:18:40,764
All right?

1151
01:18:41,206 --> 01:18:45,085
Why don't you go get your bags,
and I'll wait here.

1152
01:18:45,526 --> 01:18:47,357
Are you all right?

1153
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:50,274
I'm fine.

1154
01:19:05,566 --> 01:19:07,045
Get back!

1155
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:11,965
That's not mine!

1156
01:19:21,366 --> 01:19:22,879
Get back!

1157
01:19:28,526 --> 01:19:30,084
Don't do it!

1158
01:19:33,406 --> 01:19:35,124
Come on!

1159
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:40,604
Hurry!

1160
01:19:45,806 --> 01:19:47,364
-It's locked.
-Where's the key?

1161
01:19:47,806 --> 01:19:48,761
-It's not mine.
-All right.

1162
01:19:49,206 --> 01:19:50,525
Get in the bathroom.

1163
01:19:54,846 --> 01:19:56,962
1075. 47th and 8th!

1164
01:19:57,406 --> 01:19:59,476
All right. We're trapped!
Two alarms on arrival!

1165
01:20:01,566 --> 01:20:03,636
Oh, my God.

1166
01:20:04,086 --> 01:20:05,883
He's nailed it down.

1167
01:20:06,326 --> 01:20:09,079
Baby, don't open the window.
It'll suck the fire towards us.

1168
01:20:15,286 --> 01:20:18,039
-They were here.
-Jesus Christ, that's Eddie's.

1169
01:20:18,486 --> 01:20:19,805
They were here!

1170
01:20:20,246 --> 01:20:23,124
Calm down, Daphne.
Just get in the tub.

1171
01:20:24,446 --> 01:20:25,640
-There's gasoline.
-What?

1172
01:20:26,086 --> 01:20:27,235
There's gasoline in here.

1173
01:20:27,686 --> 01:20:29,756
-What are you doing?
-I'm pouring it out.

1174
01:20:30,206 --> 01:20:32,117
-It's not going down.
-Oh, my God.

1175
01:20:35,766 --> 01:20:37,040
Give it to me.

1176
01:20:38,486 --> 01:20:39,714
Jesus Christ.
It's clogged. God damn it.

1177
01:20:40,166 --> 01:20:42,157
Please do something.
We're going to die.

1178
01:20:43,886 --> 01:20:45,001
Forget it.
They're all clogged.

1179
01:20:45,446 --> 01:20:49,155
Come on, baby.
Just stay low and stay calm.

1180
01:21:20,366 --> 01:21:23,802
90% people who die in a fire
die from eating smoke.

1181
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:26,282
Let me introduce you
to my partner...

1182
01:21:26,726 --> 01:21:29,001
and the man
who started the fire.

1183
01:21:33,326 --> 01:21:35,521
Say something for your fans.

1184
01:21:40,366 --> 01:21:42,641
Stand back and get down!
Just get back and stay low.

1185
01:21:45,126 --> 01:21:46,798
Stay low!

1186
01:21:57,566 --> 01:21:59,761
This'll buy us some time!

1187
01:22:16,566 --> 01:22:18,921
Get back!

1188
01:22:24,006 --> 01:22:25,234
This is a great film.

1189
01:22:25,686 --> 01:22:29,361
We can see fire right now,
and Daphne's in the fire.

1190
01:22:36,766 --> 01:22:38,199
Tell him it's OK.

1191
01:22:44,806 --> 01:22:46,159
Let's go!

1192
01:23:05,686 --> 01:23:07,244
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1193
01:23:07,686 --> 01:23:09,722
Get that plug now!

1194
01:23:23,846 --> 01:23:25,518
Take care of the boy.

1195
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:29,122
And get her some oxygen!

1196
01:23:34,606 --> 01:23:36,915
You all right?
What the hell happened up there?

1197
01:23:37,366 --> 01:23:39,800
It was a setup. Somebody
booby-trapped the apartment.

1198
01:23:40,246 --> 01:23:42,362
-Who?
-It's gotta be the same guys.

1199
01:23:42,806 --> 01:23:45,115
You gotta speak louder.
I can't hearyou.

1200
01:23:45,566 --> 01:23:46,715
Jordy, are you hurt?

1201
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:47,996
-I'm all right.
-What?

1202
01:23:48,446 --> 01:23:50,596
You have to speak up.

1203
01:23:51,046 --> 01:23:53,321
What the hell
are you talking about?

1204
01:23:53,766 --> 01:23:56,405
What is it?

1205
01:24:05,566 --> 01:24:06,521
We have a disturbance
in the lobby.

1206
01:24:06,966 --> 01:24:08,365
-Where's Hawkins?
-He's not on the premises.

1207
01:24:08,806 --> 01:24:10,956
Go get that tape
and bring it here right now.

1208
01:24:11,406 --> 01:24:12,521
Any request for that
video-tape has to go to--

1209
01:24:12,966 --> 01:24:15,799
Woman, I am begging you!
You can't let this happen!

1210
01:24:16,246 --> 01:24:17,565
You want that tape,
contact the at torney.

1211
01:24:18,006 --> 01:24:18,597
I'll be happy to give you--

1212
01:24:19,046 --> 01:24:20,445
You thinkwe're joking?

1213
01:24:22,726 --> 01:24:25,399
Listen,you can't do this!
Don't do this to Eddie.

1214
01:24:25,846 --> 01:24:27,245
Don't do it to
the people of this city.

1215
01:24:27,686 --> 01:24:29,119
You can't show
the man's murder on TV!

1216
01:24:29,566 --> 01:24:31,921
You want the tape, there it is!

1217
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,602
Stay tuned for a special edition
of "Top Story."

1218
01:24:37,046 --> 01:24:38,274
Detective Eddie Flemming's
brutal murder...

1219
01:24:38,726 --> 01:24:41,399
has been video-taped,
and we will broadcast it...

1220
01:24:41,846 --> 01:24:43,199
after these messages.

1221
01:24:43,646 --> 01:24:45,955
Hard to believe. Watch.

1222
01:25:07,086 --> 01:25:08,963
Who says you can't be
success in America?

1223
01:25:09,406 --> 01:25:13,957
I came here with nothing,
knowing nobody, and now, look.

1224
01:25:15,886 --> 01:25:17,285
I am success story.

1225
01:25:22,606 --> 01:25:24,801
Why did you say "I"?

1226
01:25:25,246 --> 01:25:27,157
-It should be "we."
-Don't be paranoid.

1227
01:25:27,606 --> 01:25:29,085
I gave you half of
what they gave me.

1228
01:25:29,526 --> 01:25:30,322
Good evening.
I'm Robert Hawkins...

1229
01:25:30,766 --> 01:25:31,596
and this is "Top Story."

1230
01:25:32,046 --> 01:25:33,604
-Here we are.
-Tonight I present to you...

1231
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:35,399
material of a graphic
and violent nature...

1232
01:25:35,846 --> 01:25:37,962
never before seen
on television...

1233
01:25:38,406 --> 01:25:40,715
and I do so with a heavy heart.

1234
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:42,201
It would only be normal
to askwhy.

1235
01:25:42,646 --> 01:25:44,602
Why are we showing something
so disturbing?

1236
01:25:45,046 --> 01:25:47,276
And my answer
is as a journalist...

1237
01:25:47,726 --> 01:25:49,159
I am obligated to show it.

1238
01:25:49,606 --> 01:25:52,040
I air this tape
in loving memory...

1239
01:25:52,486 --> 01:25:53,714
of my friend Eddie Flemming.

1240
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:56,726
Hard to believe.

1241
01:25:59,126 --> 01:26:00,161
Watch.

1242
01:26:00,606 --> 01:26:05,122
You film killing me,
you're gonna get away with that?

1243
01:26:05,566 --> 01:26:07,363
Just turn it off.

1244
01:26:07,806 --> 01:26:09,603
Cut! This is my project.

1245
01:26:10,046 --> 01:26:12,162
I'm the director,
and I say action.

1246
01:26:12,606 --> 01:26:14,085
Shut the [beep] up!

1247
01:26:47,926 --> 01:26:49,803
Why did you leave that stuff in
about you being a director?

1248
01:26:50,246 --> 01:26:52,202
-Because I am the director.
-What?

1249
01:26:52,646 --> 01:26:54,284
Don't you fucking realize
if it wasn't for me...

1250
01:26:54,726 --> 01:26:58,844
for my idea, no fucking way
we'd be sitting here right now?

1251
01:26:59,286 --> 01:27:01,117
-Your idea?
-My idea.

1252
01:27:01,566 --> 01:27:03,284
Is that the guy?

1253
01:27:04,646 --> 01:27:05,635
Don't you understand?

1254
01:27:06,086 --> 01:27:08,316
This is a greatAmerican movie,
and who made it?

1255
01:27:08,766 --> 01:27:10,165
I made it all.
I was the director.

1256
01:27:10,606 --> 01:27:12,324
-Who are you?
-Everything.

1257
01:27:12,766 --> 01:27:14,563
I am everything.

1258
01:27:15,006 --> 01:27:16,564
This is whatAmerica wants--
violence and sex.

1259
01:27:17,006 --> 01:27:19,361
Before we hand in
the nextvideo...

1260
01:27:19,806 --> 01:27:21,524
I'm gonna put titles on it...

1261
01:27:21,966 --> 01:27:26,005
and my credit is going to read,
"Directed by Oleg Razgul."

1262
01:27:26,446 --> 01:27:29,040
Yeah, but there is
only one problem.

1263
01:27:29,486 --> 01:27:31,841
One credit,
but I don't share credit.

1264
01:27:32,286 --> 01:27:34,083
-You got it?
-Share credit?

1265
01:27:34,526 --> 01:27:35,925
You think you're a director?

1266
01:27:36,366 --> 01:27:42,157
You're just a little,
small, Russian piece of shit.

1267
01:27:45,046 --> 01:27:46,320
Let's go!

1268
01:27:57,886 --> 01:27:59,763
This is Robert Hawkins
for "Top Story."

1269
01:28:00,206 --> 01:28:02,561
We'll be back after this.

1270
01:28:03,006 --> 01:28:04,997
All right, I'm here.
Oh,Jesus.

1271
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:06,799
This is the man
I told you about.

1272
01:28:07,246 --> 01:28:09,316
This is Bruce Cutler.

1273
01:28:10,646 --> 01:28:11,601
Bryan, come get this from here.

1274
01:28:12,046 --> 01:28:14,879
I am Emil. I'm insane.

1275
01:28:15,326 --> 01:28:16,964
Are you my lawyer?

1276
01:28:17,406 --> 01:28:18,316
Not just yet.

1277
01:28:18,766 --> 01:28:20,722
I got your money.

1278
01:28:26,286 --> 01:28:27,799
Where is it?

1279
01:28:28,246 --> 01:28:30,157
Shit,where is it?

1280
01:28:30,606 --> 01:28:31,482
Where is it?!

1281
01:28:31,926 --> 01:28:33,678
He's got the camera!
He's got the movie!

1282
01:28:34,126 --> 01:28:34,956
Let's sit down
and talk a minute.

1283
01:28:35,406 --> 01:28:36,759
I need it! Where is it?

1284
01:28:37,206 --> 01:28:37,877
Don't move!

1285
01:28:38,326 --> 01:28:40,317
Get your hands up
and drop the gun!

1286
01:28:40,766 --> 01:28:42,518
Drop the goddamn gun!

1287
01:28:44,926 --> 01:28:46,041
What did you hit him for?
He surrendered!

1288
01:28:46,486 --> 01:28:48,636
-Go tight on them.
-He's unarmed and hurt!

1289
01:28:49,086 --> 01:28:49,996
I'm going with you.

1290
01:28:50,446 --> 01:28:51,356
Come on!

1291
01:28:51,806 --> 01:28:52,921
I'm coming down there with you.

1292
01:28:53,366 --> 01:28:54,276
I'm his lawyer--

1293
01:28:54,726 --> 01:28:55,681
Turn the camera off!

1294
01:28:56,126 --> 01:28:58,765
Keep going! Keepfilming!

1295
01:28:59,206 --> 01:29:00,924
I'm invoking his rights!

1296
01:29:01,366 --> 01:29:02,162
What's going on?

1297
01:29:02,606 --> 01:29:03,402
I'm going with you.

1298
01:29:03,846 --> 01:29:05,040
Fuck!

1299
01:29:05,486 --> 01:29:06,475
I'm going down there with you.

1300
01:29:06,926 --> 01:29:08,041
What's going on?!

1301
01:29:08,486 --> 01:29:09,714
They're taking you downtown.

1302
01:29:10,166 --> 01:29:12,282
-Whoa! I'll take him.
-He's mine!

1303
01:29:12,726 --> 01:29:13,522
I'm taking him.
Don't argue with me.

1304
01:29:13,966 --> 01:29:15,524
-He's my collar!
-He killed my partner!

1305
01:29:15,966 --> 01:29:17,684
After he's booked, he's yours,
but I'm walking him in!

1306
01:29:18,126 --> 01:29:20,003
All right, kid,
have your 15 minutes.

1307
01:29:20,446 --> 01:29:23,563
Tommy, ride with him.
Get in the fucking car.

1308
01:29:24,006 --> 01:29:25,644
Don't speak to him!

1309
01:29:27,246 --> 01:29:28,122
Put your head in!

1310
01:29:28,566 --> 01:29:29,635
Get him in the car, Tommy!

1311
01:29:30,086 --> 01:29:31,519
Put your head in,you fool!

1312
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:33,365
I ain't playing with you!
Shit!

1313
01:29:33,806 --> 01:29:36,525
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

1314
01:29:36,966 --> 01:29:38,160
Bullshit, Leon!

1315
01:29:38,606 --> 01:29:40,915
Ashamed of what?
I got him off the streets.

1316
01:29:41,366 --> 01:29:42,401
Bravo, Mr Hawkins!

1317
01:29:42,846 --> 01:29:44,518
You better back off.

1318
01:29:44,966 --> 01:29:46,001
You are sick!

1319
01:29:46,446 --> 01:29:47,401
I'm fed up with your bullshit!

1320
01:29:47,846 --> 01:29:49,484
Let go!

1321
01:29:52,766 --> 01:29:54,404
Get outta here!

1322
01:29:58,606 --> 01:30:01,996
Where are you going?
You'll lose everybody!

1323
01:30:02,446 --> 01:30:03,925
What are you doing, man?

1324
01:30:04,366 --> 01:30:05,640
This is not the way
to the station!

1325
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:20,004
Talk to me!
You're losing them!

1326
01:30:20,446 --> 01:30:22,004
Answer me, man!

1327
01:30:48,366 --> 01:30:49,845
-Answer me!
-Where am l?

1328
01:30:50,286 --> 01:30:52,675
-What the hell--
-What's going on?

1329
01:30:53,126 --> 01:30:55,515
Hold on. Wait!

1330
01:30:55,966 --> 01:30:57,081
Come on!

1331
01:30:57,526 --> 01:30:59,596
Where's my lawyer?
Where are they?

1332
01:31:00,046 --> 01:31:01,365
God damn it!

1333
01:31:01,806 --> 01:31:04,240
What's wrong with you, man?
Shit!

1334
01:31:04,686 --> 01:31:06,916
Fuck you!
What's going on?

1335
01:31:07,366 --> 01:31:09,357
Jordy, listen!
Wait a minute!

1336
01:31:09,806 --> 01:31:11,000
You can't do this, man!

1337
01:31:11,446 --> 01:31:13,277
Listen! Wait,Jordy!

1338
01:31:15,766 --> 01:31:16,437
Come on.

1339
01:31:16,886 --> 01:31:18,080
Listen, man, please!

1340
01:31:18,526 --> 01:31:22,963
How'd you know how to rig
that apartment?

1341
01:31:23,406 --> 01:31:25,158
My father was a fireman.

1342
01:31:25,606 --> 01:31:28,040
He taught me about fire.
Now it's my friend.

1343
01:31:28,486 --> 01:31:30,044
-Take a walk.
-You're not thinking straight.

1344
01:31:30,486 --> 01:31:31,635
Don't you get it?
He knew he'd get caught.

1345
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:33,314
That's why you video-taped
Eddie's murder!

1346
01:31:33,766 --> 01:31:35,324
I want to see
this son of a bitch dead, too--

1347
01:31:35,766 --> 01:31:36,835
It's over tonight,
you son of a bitch!

1348
01:31:37,286 --> 01:31:38,082
You can't kill him
in cold blood!

1349
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:39,561
Get the hell outta here!

1350
01:31:40,006 --> 01:31:40,916
Get in the car!

1351
01:31:41,366 --> 01:31:44,881
Listen to me!
I'm not gonna let you do this!

1352
01:31:45,326 --> 01:31:47,396
Get in the car! Go!

1353
01:31:47,846 --> 01:31:48,756
Now go!

1354
01:31:49,206 --> 01:31:51,959
Fuck it, man! Shit!

1355
01:31:52,406 --> 01:31:54,317
Something fucking funny?

1356
01:31:54,766 --> 01:31:56,165
Refreshing.

1357
01:31:56,606 --> 01:31:58,756
You think this is funny?!

1358
01:31:59,206 --> 01:32:00,685
Turn around!

1359
01:32:01,126 --> 01:32:04,038
You want to be famous?
You want headlines?

1360
01:32:05,606 --> 01:32:06,925
Now's your chance.

1361
01:32:07,366 --> 01:32:08,435
Put your hands up.

1362
01:32:08,886 --> 01:32:10,956
Get your goddamn hands up!

1363
01:32:12,286 --> 01:32:14,402
Turn around.

1364
01:32:14,846 --> 01:32:16,564
You want to be
a real American, right?

1365
01:32:17,006 --> 01:32:17,722
You want to be a tough guy?

1366
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:21,363
Here's Eddie's gun.
You remember him?

1367
01:32:27,046 --> 01:32:27,842
Come on.

1368
01:32:28,286 --> 01:32:30,004
You want to be famous?
Shoot me.

1369
01:32:30,446 --> 01:32:31,925
Want headlines?
Want to make money?

1370
01:32:32,366 --> 01:32:34,436
Want to be a celebrity?
Shoot me!

1371
01:32:36,566 --> 01:32:39,876
You can't kill me.
You're not a cop.

1372
01:32:40,326 --> 01:32:42,237
You're just a fireman
with a gun.

1373
01:32:45,046 --> 01:32:48,834
OK...l'll make it easy.

1374
01:33:04,886 --> 01:33:11,678
You Americans are pussies
without your missiles and money.

1375
01:33:12,126 --> 01:33:15,277
You won't kill me.

1376
01:33:15,726 --> 01:33:17,876
You don't have the balls.

1377
01:33:35,166 --> 01:33:36,918
Don't do it, brother!

1378
01:33:37,366 --> 01:33:39,197
Kill me.

1379
01:33:39,646 --> 01:33:41,238
Get up!

1380
01:33:41,686 --> 01:33:43,677
You are mine now, sucker!

1381
01:33:44,126 --> 01:33:45,559
You are out of control,
you know that?

1382
01:33:46,006 --> 01:33:47,803
Here's Eddie's gun.

1383
01:33:49,446 --> 01:33:51,516
Where you going?

1384
01:33:51,966 --> 01:33:54,639
I lost my shoe.
I want my shoe.

1385
01:33:55,086 --> 01:33:56,963
Get him out of here!

1386
01:34:02,406 --> 01:34:05,921
Emil Slovak is a victim here.
He is not a culprit.

1387
01:34:06,366 --> 01:34:07,401
We all appreciate the tragedy...

1388
01:34:07,846 --> 01:34:09,564
of the death
of Detective Flemming.

1389
01:34:10,006 --> 01:34:11,359
I represent Mr Slovak.

1390
01:34:11,806 --> 01:34:14,878
He was operating under the undue
influence of his partner.

1391
01:34:15,326 --> 01:34:16,884
This will all come out
at the trial...

1392
01:34:17,326 --> 01:34:19,635
and Emil will be vindicated.
I will see to that.

1393
01:34:22,406 --> 01:34:24,158
-Good job.
-Thanks.

1394
01:34:24,606 --> 01:34:26,244
How you feeling?

1395
01:34:26,686 --> 01:34:27,960
I brought letters.

1396
01:34:28,406 --> 01:34:29,964
Fan mail from women.

1397
01:34:30,406 --> 01:34:31,441
One wants to buy you a suit...

1398
01:34:31,886 --> 01:34:34,275
another one sent money,
and another one wants money.

1399
01:34:34,726 --> 01:34:36,603
-Bring me the cigarettes?
-I did.

1400
01:34:38,406 --> 01:34:42,081
The perception out there
is very bad, Emil, right now.

1401
01:34:42,526 --> 01:34:43,675
And perception is reality.

1402
01:34:44,126 --> 01:34:45,320
You may not be crazy...

1403
01:34:45,766 --> 01:34:46,755
but I want to get
that message out...

1404
01:34:47,206 --> 01:34:48,525
and I want to get it out now.

1405
01:34:48,966 --> 01:34:50,479
That's our only defence
in this case.

1406
01:34:50,926 --> 01:34:53,121
You have tofocus
on three things--

1407
01:34:53,566 --> 01:34:55,318
paranoia,fear, and delusions.

1408
01:34:55,766 --> 01:34:56,915
I was all of those.

1409
01:34:57,366 --> 01:35:00,676
But you never appreciated
the severity of it until now.

1410
01:35:01,126 --> 01:35:01,956
Of course not.
How could I be?

1411
01:35:02,406 --> 01:35:05,159
I was paranoid,
fear ful, and deluded.

1412
01:35:08,366 --> 01:35:09,924
Now...what about Oleg?

1413
01:35:10,366 --> 01:35:12,163
They're looking
all over for him.

1414
01:35:12,606 --> 01:35:14,961
Haven't found him.
Maybe he went back to Russia.

1415
01:35:15,406 --> 01:35:16,759
I don't know.

1416
01:35:17,206 --> 01:35:17,956
He's here.

1417
01:35:18,406 --> 01:35:19,521
Let'sforget about him
and focus on you.

1418
01:35:19,966 --> 01:35:21,684
You're what's most important.

1419
01:35:22,126 --> 01:35:25,960
What about my movie rights?
Book rights?

1420
01:35:26,406 --> 01:35:27,919
Foryou?

1421
01:35:28,366 --> 01:35:31,483
I have not thought
about that, Emil.

1422
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:34,394
How much do you want?
What's your cut?

1423
01:35:35,846 --> 01:35:39,361
I thinkwe could be partners.
50-50.

1424
01:35:39,806 --> 01:35:41,364
No way.

1425
01:35:41,806 --> 01:35:43,034
I give you 30%, no more.

1426
01:35:43,486 --> 01:35:44,601
Don't forget.
We're in it together.

1427
01:35:45,046 --> 01:35:46,274
I thought 40%
might be all right.

1428
01:35:46,726 --> 01:35:48,318
Oh, my God!

1429
01:35:48,766 --> 01:35:50,677
Thirty,
or I call another lawyer.

1430
01:35:51,126 --> 01:35:52,559
This is the biggest
case of your life.

1431
01:35:53,006 --> 01:35:55,998
Don't try to negotiate.
Say yes or no.

1432
01:36:01,046 --> 01:36:03,640
I can live with 30%,
but, Emil, it's important...

1433
01:36:04,086 --> 01:36:06,395
you understand
this is not all about money.

1434
01:36:06,846 --> 01:36:07,961
What else do you need?

1435
01:36:08,406 --> 01:36:11,716
I need to know about you,
what makes you tick.

1436
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:13,645
I need to know
about your background.

1437
01:36:14,086 --> 01:36:15,439
I need to know about
your mother,your father...

1438
01:36:15,886 --> 01:36:16,762
your brother,your sister,
everything.

1439
01:36:17,206 --> 01:36:19,640
That's what I need to know.

1440
01:36:21,406 --> 01:36:23,966
My father always degraded me.

1441
01:36:24,406 --> 01:36:25,361
He killed my self-esteem.

1442
01:36:25,806 --> 01:36:29,401
He hated me from the day
when I was born.

1443
01:36:33,726 --> 01:36:36,160
Emil Slovak
will appear in court today.

1444
01:36:36,606 --> 01:36:37,755
His lawyer--

1445
01:36:38,206 --> 01:36:40,162
Stay focused. Start again.

1446
01:36:41,686 --> 01:36:43,995
Emil Slovak
will appear in court today.

1447
01:36:44,446 --> 01:36:48,883
His lawyer will argue that
his client is mentally unfit...

1448
01:36:49,326 --> 01:36:50,725
This is such bullshit.

1449
01:36:51,166 --> 01:36:54,954
In a related matter, Mr Slovak's
attorney Bruce Cutler...

1450
01:36:55,406 --> 01:36:58,284
famous for handling
sensational cases...

1451
01:36:58,726 --> 01:37:01,160
claims his client is
unfit to stand trial.

1452
01:37:01,606 --> 01:37:04,325
Bobby,want to give me
a break already?

1453
01:37:04,766 --> 01:37:06,802
Hello?
No, not you, hon.

1454
01:37:07,246 --> 01:37:09,316
Hello? No,
we have no comment.

1455
01:37:09,766 --> 01:37:12,155
...his partner Oleg Razgul,
who threatened to kill him...

1456
01:37:12,606 --> 01:37:13,516
if he didn't follow his orders.

1457
01:37:13,966 --> 01:37:16,355
I gotta go!

1458
01:37:16,806 --> 01:37:18,683
I'm going back to
the Czech Republic...

1459
01:37:19,126 --> 01:37:20,400
toface the charges against me.

1460
01:37:20,846 --> 01:37:21,995
I'm innocent.

1461
01:37:22,446 --> 01:37:23,879
If she shot a cop
who raped her sister...

1462
01:37:24,326 --> 01:37:26,442
in this country,
she'd be a hero.

1463
01:37:27,766 --> 01:37:29,040
And I approached him
and asked him...

1464
01:37:29,486 --> 01:37:31,044
for some spare change.
Politely, right?

1465
01:37:31,486 --> 01:37:33,841
Whereupon he pulls out
his big gun...

1466
01:37:34,286 --> 01:37:35,162
pushed me
all up in the tree...

1467
01:37:35,606 --> 01:37:37,676
hand cuffs me
like this up here...

1468
01:37:38,126 --> 01:37:39,479
and then he takes
my money, right?

1469
01:37:39,926 --> 01:37:41,154
Took my money and
left me here like this...

1470
01:37:41,606 --> 01:37:42,516
exposed to all the elements.

1471
01:37:42,966 --> 01:37:44,399
Un-fucking-believable.

1472
01:37:44,846 --> 01:37:46,245
Look at this fucking guy.

1473
01:37:46,686 --> 01:37:48,563
Kids, you know,
if you out there...

1474
01:37:49,006 --> 01:37:51,201
don't hate your firemen.

1475
01:37:51,646 --> 01:37:52,840
Not all Fire Marshals like this.

1476
01:37:53,286 --> 01:37:55,720
It's not like this,
so keep the love.

1477
01:37:58,446 --> 01:38:00,516
Hard to believe.
You're watching "Top Story."

1478
01:38:00,966 --> 01:38:02,445
How could you forget that
you hand cuffed a civilian...

1479
01:38:02,886 --> 01:38:04,524
to a fucking tree
in Central Park...

1480
01:38:04,966 --> 01:38:06,081
in the middle of the night?!
Tell me that!

1481
01:38:06,526 --> 01:38:08,357
Look, all right,
I know I screwed up...

1482
01:38:08,806 --> 01:38:10,285
but it's not like this guy
is some innocent civilian.

1483
01:38:10,726 --> 01:38:12,557
He'll end your career
and probably mine!

1484
01:38:13,006 --> 01:38:14,564
End my career?

1485
01:38:15,006 --> 01:38:16,837
What am I talking about?
The press will be all over us!

1486
01:38:17,286 --> 01:38:18,435
Get the fuck back to your desks!

1487
01:38:18,886 --> 01:38:20,638
Come on, Chief.
Look at my file.

1488
01:38:21,086 --> 01:38:22,917
I've never had a civilian
complaint against me before.

1489
01:38:23,366 --> 01:38:25,675
-I crack big cases.
-Your record doesn't matter!

1490
01:38:26,126 --> 01:38:27,002
It should mean something!

1491
01:38:27,446 --> 01:38:28,674
That's past history!
Don't you get it?

1492
01:38:29,126 --> 01:38:32,914
Look, I'm sorry.
It's unfortunate...

1493
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:35,197
that I have to make decisions
based on your press coverage...

1494
01:38:35,646 --> 01:38:36,999
but that's what I gotta do.

1495
01:38:37,446 --> 01:38:41,644
You're suspended, without pay,
pending a department trial.

1496
01:38:42,086 --> 01:38:44,475
Not to mention
your criminal charges.

1497
01:38:44,926 --> 01:38:46,359
That's not right.

1498
01:38:46,806 --> 01:38:49,718
You better get yourself
a damn good lawyer.

1499
01:39:29,246 --> 01:39:31,476
...over a million dollars
for the disputed video.

1500
01:39:31,926 --> 01:39:35,441
In related news, Emil Slovak
is back in court tomorrow...

1501
01:39:35,886 --> 01:39:36,762
where we're expected to learn...

1502
01:39:37,206 --> 01:39:38,958
if he is competent
to stand trial.

1503
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:42,523
Meanwhile, the massive manhunt
continuesfor Oleg Razgul...

1504
01:39:42,966 --> 01:39:44,399
the alleged mastermind
behind the murder...

1505
01:39:44,846 --> 01:39:46,438
of New York City Detective
Eddie Flemming.

1506
01:39:46,886 --> 01:39:49,559
"Action News" has learned that
Mr Slovakwon't have to worry...

1507
01:39:50,006 --> 01:39:51,439
about how he is going
to pay for his defence.

1508
01:39:51,886 --> 01:39:53,001
He has received movie offers...

1509
01:39:53,446 --> 01:39:56,483
and has been in conversations
with numerous publishers...

1510
01:39:56,926 --> 01:39:58,803
concerning the rights
to his story.

1511
01:40:01,206 --> 01:40:02,525
Further developments
are expected today...

1512
01:40:02,926 --> 01:40:04,644
in the bizarre Eddie Flemming
murder case.

1513
01:40:05,086 --> 01:40:07,042
Judge Stanley Stern
will issue his ruling...

1514
01:40:07,486 --> 01:40:10,284
on alleged killer
Emil Slovak's insanity plea.

1515
01:40:10,726 --> 01:40:11,681
If the court rules
in his favour today...

1516
01:40:12,126 --> 01:40:14,515
Mr Slovakwill be
transferred to the psych ward...

1517
01:40:14,966 --> 01:40:16,319
at Rikers lsland
for further testing...

1518
01:40:16,766 --> 01:40:17,960
before being remanded
to the custody...

1519
01:40:18,406 --> 01:40:20,362
of a permanent institution
for the mentally ill.

1520
01:40:20,806 --> 01:40:22,842
Slovak's attorney Bruce Cutler
has maintained...

1521
01:40:23,286 --> 01:40:24,116
that an abusive childhood
is to blame...

1522
01:40:24,566 --> 01:40:25,442
for the actions of his client.

1523
01:40:25,886 --> 01:40:28,036
The Czech national
apparently has a history...

1524
01:40:28,486 --> 01:40:29,282
of physical
and emotional trauma...

1525
01:40:29,726 --> 01:40:32,240
heaped upon him
by an alcoholic father.

1526
01:40:40,886 --> 01:40:42,717
What's ever left over, keep it.

1527
01:40:43,166 --> 01:40:44,519
Thanks, buddy.

1528
01:41:01,406 --> 01:41:03,522
Keep the Statue of Liberty
in the background, all right?

1529
01:41:03,966 --> 01:41:05,445
-How do I look?
-You look beautiful.

1530
01:41:05,886 --> 01:41:07,877
Thanks. Fuck you. Roll.

1531
01:41:08,326 --> 01:41:09,805
What are you looking at?

1532
01:41:11,166 --> 01:41:12,360
Forget about him.
Let's go.

1533
01:41:12,806 --> 01:41:14,398
All right. Just roll.

1534
01:41:18,126 --> 01:41:19,241
All right. Let's go.

1535
01:41:19,686 --> 01:41:21,722
Bruce Cutler,
do you have a statement for us?

1536
01:41:22,166 --> 01:41:24,202
It's been a difficult
and long day for us.

1537
01:41:24,646 --> 01:41:27,080
Emil has been found
incompetent to stand trial...

1538
01:41:27,526 --> 01:41:30,165
and in times
of extreme stress...

1539
01:41:30,606 --> 01:41:32,756
as a result of
his delusional thinking...

1540
01:41:33,206 --> 01:41:36,039
he could not appreciate
the wrong fulness of his acts...

1541
01:41:36,486 --> 01:41:39,046
and therefore he's not
liable for his acts.

1542
01:41:39,486 --> 01:41:42,762
This is a victory
for the mentally ill...

1543
01:41:43,206 --> 01:41:45,436
and before Emil
is taken on the boat...

1544
01:41:45,886 --> 01:41:49,003
to the psychiatric ward
at Rikers lsland...

1545
01:41:49,446 --> 01:41:51,198
it should be noted
that what he did...

1546
01:41:51,646 --> 01:41:52,965
he was forced to do...

1547
01:41:53,406 --> 01:41:57,797
by Oleg Razgul, a dangerous
and demented individual...

1548
01:41:58,246 --> 01:41:59,315
who is at liberty right now...

1549
01:41:59,766 --> 01:42:02,485
in the streets of New York,
and both Emil and l...

1550
01:42:02,926 --> 01:42:05,724
Iook forward to when
he is brought to justice.

1551
01:42:07,206 --> 01:42:09,003
What the fuck are you
looking at,you piece of shit?

1552
01:42:09,446 --> 01:42:10,515
Officers,you have to watch him.

1553
01:42:10,966 --> 01:42:12,081
He's assaulted
my client in the past.

1554
01:42:12,526 --> 01:42:14,084
That's it? This scumbag
kills Eddie Flemming...

1555
01:42:14,526 --> 01:42:15,595
and now he gets to spend
the rest of his life...

1556
01:42:16,046 --> 01:42:17,240
in some country club nuthouse?

1557
01:42:17,686 --> 01:42:20,154
What about the victims and
the families and their rights?

1558
01:42:20,606 --> 01:42:22,517
Marshal, I understand
you don't agree...

1559
01:42:22,966 --> 01:42:25,605
but this is the system,
and this is the law.

1560
01:42:27,206 --> 01:42:28,002
Let's go.

1561
01:42:28,446 --> 01:42:30,437
I can kill you.
I'm insane.

1562
01:42:31,966 --> 01:42:34,002
We need this area cleared.
Move back.

1563
01:42:36,686 --> 01:42:37,675
...two-shot
of Cutler and Slovak.

1564
01:42:38,126 --> 01:42:38,956
All right.

1565
01:42:39,406 --> 01:42:40,600
Give me the boat
in the background.

1566
01:42:41,046 --> 01:42:42,195
Do you really believe
that your client is insane?

1567
01:42:42,646 --> 01:42:45,922
Emil knew exactly
what he was doing. Watch this.

1568
01:42:46,366 --> 01:42:48,084
All right.

1569
01:42:55,086 --> 01:42:55,916
Turn it off.

1570
01:42:56,366 --> 01:42:58,197
This tape I kept for myself.

1571
01:43:01,326 --> 01:43:03,362
In hospital
I say I'm not crazy...

1572
01:43:03,806 --> 01:43:05,922
and because of your
double jeopardy law...

1573
01:43:06,366 --> 01:43:08,596
we can't be tried for
the same crime twice.

1574
01:43:09,046 --> 01:43:12,004
We come out
free, rich, and famous.

1575
01:43:12,446 --> 01:43:15,006
Can we deal for this?

1576
01:43:19,006 --> 01:43:20,598
It'sfree.

1577
01:43:22,006 --> 01:43:23,485
What would you say
to evidence...

1578
01:43:23,926 --> 01:43:25,484
that proves your client
is not insane?

1579
01:43:25,926 --> 01:43:27,279
"Top Story" has
the truth right here...

1580
01:43:27,726 --> 01:43:29,159
from Oleg Razgul himself.

1581
01:43:29,606 --> 01:43:32,040
You knew what you were doing.

1582
01:43:32,486 --> 01:43:33,919
It's all in here...in my movie.

1583
01:43:34,366 --> 01:43:37,199
Officers, do your duty
and arrest this man!

1584
01:43:37,646 --> 01:43:39,637
I'm not the killer.
I'm the director. Action!

1585
01:43:46,726 --> 01:43:48,284
-Back off!
-Let her go!

1586
01:43:48,726 --> 01:43:51,081
Everyone, back away from me!

1587
01:43:51,526 --> 01:43:52,641
Hold your fire!
Do not fire your weapons!

1588
01:43:53,086 --> 01:43:53,996
Stay back!

1589
01:43:54,446 --> 01:43:55,276
Nobody's gonna fire.

1590
01:43:55,726 --> 01:43:56,636
-Hold that line!
-Let her go!

1591
01:43:57,086 --> 01:43:58,519
Tell him to put his gun down.

1592
01:43:58,966 --> 01:44:01,196
-All right.
-Get that shotgun out of here!

1593
01:44:01,646 --> 01:44:02,999
-Nobody's gonna fire.
-Stay back!

1594
01:44:03,446 --> 01:44:05,437
Everybody, get back!
Do not fire, anyone!

1595
01:44:05,886 --> 01:44:06,841
-Lower those weapons!
-Go tighter.

1596
01:44:07,286 --> 01:44:08,275
Now! Lower!

1597
01:44:08,726 --> 01:44:09,602
Tell him to put his gun down!

1598
01:44:10,046 --> 01:44:11,365
-Put your weapon down!
-Let her go!

1599
01:44:11,806 --> 01:44:12,955
If he doesn't lower his gun,
I'llfucking kill her!

1600
01:44:13,406 --> 01:44:15,078
-Officer, lower that weapon!
-Loweryour gun!

1601
01:44:15,526 --> 01:44:17,118
-Remember what he did to Eddie!
-Shut up!

1602
01:44:17,566 --> 01:44:18,442
Do not fire that weapon!

1603
01:44:18,886 --> 01:44:22,117
I'll surrender
if he lowers his gun.

1604
01:44:22,566 --> 01:44:24,636
Don't you let this
piece of shit surrender!

1605
01:44:25,086 --> 01:44:26,599
If you don't let me surrender,
I kill her now.

1606
01:44:27,046 --> 01:44:28,638
-I don't care!
-I kill her now.

1607
01:44:29,086 --> 01:44:29,996
Do not fire that weapon!

1608
01:44:30,446 --> 01:44:31,845
-Shut up!
-Take that shot.

1609
01:44:32,286 --> 01:44:33,878
God damn it!
You take that fucking shot!

1610
01:44:34,326 --> 01:44:37,238
Officer, for the last time,
lower your weapon!

1611
01:44:40,886 --> 01:44:43,036
Look, he's lowered the weapon.
Don't shoot her.

1612
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:44,601
You take that shot.

1613
01:44:45,046 --> 01:44:48,675
He lowered his weapon.
You don't have to shoot her.

1614
01:44:49,126 --> 01:44:50,559
He lowered the weapon,
all right?

1615
01:45:07,566 --> 01:45:09,397
You're OK.
Don't look back.

1616
01:45:09,846 --> 01:45:12,041
Don't look at him.

1617
01:45:17,686 --> 01:45:20,883
Fuck! Did you get that?
Fuck!

1618
01:45:25,886 --> 01:45:27,399
Let's get you out of here.

1619
01:45:33,726 --> 01:45:35,045
Hey, boss.
He's still alive.

1620
01:45:35,486 --> 01:45:36,680
Come on. Let's go.

1621
01:46:18,326 --> 01:46:20,681
How was that?

1622
01:46:21,726 --> 01:46:23,239
That was great.

1623
01:46:43,446 --> 01:46:45,721
Thanks.

1624
01:46:51,526 --> 01:46:52,879
I thought you might want that.

1625
01:46:59,406 --> 01:47:01,203
Alan, here.
Take this camera.

1626
01:47:03,046 --> 01:47:04,001
Marshal.

1627
01:47:04,446 --> 01:47:06,402
Marshal,you feel up
to making a statement?

1628
01:47:06,846 --> 01:47:07,596
All right. Forget it.
No statement.

1629
01:47:08,046 --> 01:47:09,604
Cut the camera.
Listen, I can help you.

1630
01:47:10,046 --> 01:47:11,240
Take a lessonfrom Eddie.

1631
01:47:11,686 --> 01:47:12,914
The media can be
a powerful ally.

1632
01:47:17,766 --> 01:47:20,803
Eddie was my friend.
I'd like to be yours, too.

1633
01:47:42,686 --> 01:47:43,880
Good job.

1634
01:48:30,726 --> 01:48:32,523
-You OK?
-I'm fine. Fuck him.

1635
01:48:32,966 --> 01:48:35,605
Follow him walking away,
and then whip back to me.

1636
01:48:45,366 --> 01:48:47,402
We've been talking with
Fire Marshal Jordan Warsaw.

1637
01:48:47,846 --> 01:48:48,801
He's understandably
over whelmed...

1638
01:48:49,246 --> 01:48:50,599
with what's just
occurred here today--

1639
01:48:51,046 --> 01:48:53,002
the tragic end
of two vicious psychopaths...

1640
01:48:53,446 --> 01:48:54,595
who attempted to manipulate
the news media...

1641
01:48:55,046 --> 01:48:56,604
for their own greed and egos.

1642
01:48:57,046 --> 01:48:59,002
We at "Top Story"
will never allow ourselves...

1643
01:48:59,446 --> 01:49:00,595
to be used in this way.

1644
01:49:01,046 --> 01:49:04,004
Our goal is to bring you
the news in all its complexity.

1645
01:49:04,446 --> 01:49:06,198
The truth was
the real hero here today...

1646
01:49:06,646 --> 01:49:07,840
and we're proud
to have brought it to you...

1647
01:49:08,286 --> 01:49:10,197
exclusively on "Top Story."

1648
01:49:10,646 --> 01:49:13,399
This is Robert Hawkins.
Good night.
