Is Christina sleeping?

00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:23,444
Yes. She's gonna be
so disappointed
she missed your arrival.

Oh.

Well, yes, in the morning.

and make yourself comfortable?

187
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:35,282
Yeah.

Is there anything wrong?

No, I just...

The keys for my suitcase,
I left them
in one of my pockets.

No, uh...

193
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:57,957
I don't think so.
I put it in one of my pockets.

194
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,743
Do you think you could
get these open for Anna?

195
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:05,312
Sure. I'll just get my toolbox.

DR. GROSBARD: Why did you take
so long to contact me?

We thought
all of our girls were
accounted for, Dr. Grosbard.

00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,721
It wasn't until workmen
were clearing debris
from the fire

Some of the girls had
already left
for the summer break.

who was missing.

I know how difficult
this must be for you, Doctor.

325
00:23:56,783 --> 00:24:00,526
But you must believe and accept
that Kirsten is in God's grace.

00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,005
And where's her room?

327

Mm-hmm.

328
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:12,059
That was her desk.

329
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:13,930
And this is where she slept.

330
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:24,941
Were there any personal effects?

331
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:29,250
Jewelry or a wristwatch?

332
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:31,774
She wore a pendant
around her neck, always.

333
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:33,472
Now it's not here.

334
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:36,518

-Perhaps it was destroyed.
-Mm-hmm.

of the accident.

Where? What is her name?

344
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:10,465
She went to America
to work for a family there.

00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,598
Now, she and Kirsten.
Were they close?

346
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:14,774
I suppose so.

347
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:18,125
Kirsten asked to be switched
to her room several months ago.

00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:15,156
once upon a time,
there was a beautiful
young girl...

523
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,027
With pretty hair.

524
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:18,899
...who lived
in the forest with her...

525
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:21,075
CHRISTINA: Mother and father.

526
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:29,083
And as she was walking
through the woods,

527
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,780
something caught her eye.

528
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:33,131
What is it?

529
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:36,351
ANNA: Hanging from a branch,

530
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:38,397
at the end of a golden chain,

531
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,746
there was a pendant.

532
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:41,617
Pendant?

533
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:44,533
Like this.

534
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:53,455
Except, the one
on the branch bark was like
the colors of the rainbow.

535
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,284
But who did it belong to?

536
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:02,725
Oh, he's handsome.

537
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:03,813
ANNA: Isn't he?

538
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,164
He's a real prince.

539
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,731
And this pendant is a gift

540
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:12,039
that he gives to the girl
who would be his bride.

541
00:36:12,082 --> 00:36:13,649
But who gave you your pendant?

542
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:17,479
Well, that's a secret.

543
00:36:17,523 --> 00:36:19,394
I won't tell.

544
00:36:19,438 --> 00:36:21,527
Well, if I tell you, Christina,

545
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,224
you must promise
not to tell anyone.

546
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:25,052
Not even
your mother or your father.

547
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:26,575
I won't. I promise.

548
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,669
I was married once.

549
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:37,369
-You were?
-Yeah.

550
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:39,066
You're awfully young.

551
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:42,417
Well, maybe, but it was
the most important day
of my life.

552
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:44,245
Who'd you marry?

553
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,855
He was a prince.

554
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:48,728
-Get out of here.
-No, I'm serious.

555
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:52,340
A real prince,
and a very powerful man.

556
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:54,734
And he chose me

557
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:58,303
out of all the girls
in his kingdom to be his bride.

558
00:36:58,346 --> 00:37:00,653
What happened to him?
Where is he now?

559
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:03,482
My father took me away from him.

560
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:05,092
Why?

561
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:08,574
I don't know.

562
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:15,842
[SIGHS] But this pendant
is something we both share.

563
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,322
It ties us together.

564
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:21,674
And no matter how far away
my father takes me,

565
00:37:21,717 --> 00:37:24,067
my prince and I
will always be together.

566
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:25,721
That's so romantic.

567
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:28,463
Yeah.

568
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:32,380
Maybe one day,
when you have your prince,

569
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:33,947
you'll have one of these.

570
00:37:34,774 --> 00:37:37,080
Would you like that? Yeah?

571
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,821
Okay.

572
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,260
Some day.

573
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:05,805
CHRISTINA: And she goes
to look for the prince,
but that mean spirit,

574
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:09,504
the one who doesn't want her
to find him,
gets her lost in the woods.

575
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:10,940
KATE: Hmm, sounds frightening.

576
00:38:11,854 --> 00:38:13,291
Thank you, Anna.

577
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,075
ANNA: Would you like
some more pancakes, Mrs. Cowan?

578
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:16,772
No. No, but they're wonderful.

579
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:18,208
How about you, Chrissy?

580
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:19,645
-I think Chrissy's had enough.
-Yes, please.

581
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:21,908
Okay, coming right up, miss.

582
00:38:21,951 --> 00:38:22,952
Anna.

583
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:26,652
Just one more for Chrissy.

584
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,523
All right.

585
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:34,442
So what happened next?

586
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:36,096
So she gets lost in the woods,

587
00:38:36,139 --> 00:38:38,141
and her father goes
to look for her.

588
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:39,882
But that mean spirit

589
00:38:39,926 --> 00:38:43,582
makes the forest all black.
Like it's night.

590
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:48,195
And that's when the prince
comes along on his beautiful
horse and saves her.

591
00:38:48,238 --> 00:38:50,458
"Oh, the prince."
Did I hear someone
call my name?

592
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:52,765
No, Daddy,
you're not the prince.

593
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:53,940
The prince is handsome.

594
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,160
Thank you, sweetheart.

595
00:38:57,204 --> 00:38:59,380
CHRISTINA: The prince
was in Anna's picture story.

596
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:01,513
Anna's an excellent artist.

597
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:02,731
I'm sure she is.

598
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:08,563
Anna, you should
show your drawings to Daddy.

599
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:09,825
He's an artist too.

600
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:14,613
It's just a hobby, really.

601
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:16,266
Something that I do for myself.

602
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,357
Uh-huh. This looks great.

603
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,533
What's today's date?

604
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:23,361
The 20th. Why?

605
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,366
Four more days
to Mystery Mountain.

606
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:31,151
Well, I don't think
we're very anxious, are we?

607
00:39:31,194 --> 00:39:33,458
Listen, I've gotta go.
You have a good day.

608
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:34,633
Bye.

609
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:37,244
And you have a breakthrough.

610
00:39:50,649 --> 00:39:52,346
-[KNOCKING AT DOOR]
-It's open.

611
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,398
Hi.

612
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:05,881
Hope I'm not disturbing you.

613
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:08,580
No. You can't disturb somebody
who isn't doing anything.

614
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:09,624
What's up?

615
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:12,497
I thought you might
like some coffee.

616
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,455
Thanks. Coffee sounds great.

617
00:40:22,768 --> 00:40:25,205
-This is quite impressive.
-Mm.

618
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,425
Yeah. Thanks.

619
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,907
I like this one.
It's interesting.

620
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:34,083
Key art.

621
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:36,172
It's a one-sheet
for a movie poster.

622
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:38,305
For the cinema?

623
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:40,655
Yeah, it will be,
if I ever finish it.

624
00:40:40,699 --> 00:40:43,005
I just can't seem
to get a sense of...

625
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:45,747
I can't get a handle on it.

626
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,447
Wait. What is the film about?

627
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:52,232
It's a thriller
about a family under siege.

628
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:54,887
I've painted this damn thing
six times.

629
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:58,064
This is the worst one, actually.
It look like they're

630
00:40:58,107 --> 00:41:00,240
posing for a Christmas card.

631
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,767
Well, thanks for the coffee.

632
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,079
I brought the drawings.

633
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:15,081
The drawings. Oh, right.

634
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:17,475
Your drawings.

635
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:19,520
If this is a bad time,
I can come back, or...

636
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:21,479
No, that's okay.

637
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:22,784
Let's have a look.

638
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:25,395
These are not
exactly professional.

639
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,141
I'm sorry. It's the other way.

640
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:41,803
Hmm.

641
00:41:44,153 --> 00:41:45,590
I like this.

642
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:47,330
-Really?
-Really.

643
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:51,421
Can you see what's happening?

644
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:57,732
Well, it's a man in the dark.

645
00:41:58,777 --> 00:42:00,561
A forest. He's in the forest.

646
00:42:01,736 --> 00:42:03,346
And he's lost something.

647
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:05,697
His daughter.

648
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,569
He's searching for his daughter.

649
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,228
I like the way you've
obscured the forest,
and hidden things in the trees.

650
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:17,839
It's almost like you can see her
hiding in the shadows.

651
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:22,148
It's as though he were
afraid of the darkness

652
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:23,584
but drawn towards it.

653
00:42:25,978 --> 00:42:28,807
Well, sort of like the poster.

654
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:35,030
Excuse me if I sound
so presumptuous.

655
00:42:35,074 --> 00:42:36,554
No, no, no, that's okay.

656
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,599
Or perhaps if...

657
00:42:40,732 --> 00:42:43,648
...the background
was a little less defined

658
00:42:43,691 --> 00:42:47,042
so that the family is drawn
to the darkness.

659
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:49,697
Even though it's frightening.

660
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:53,396
Because there's safety
in the shadows.

661
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:03,885
I must go back to work now.

663
00:43:30,433 --> 00:43:32,000
Yeah. Hello?

WOMAN: Oh, good morning. 
This is the Au pair exchange

00:43:34,873 --> 00:43:36,570
calling from Stockholm.

Is Mrs. Cowan there, please?

Speaking.

00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,142
I'm sorry to disturb you, 
Mrs. Cowan,

669
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:44,970
but I have a gentleman here,

670
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:47,146
-a Dr. Grosbard.
-DR. GROSBARD: Grosbard.

671
00:43:47,189 --> 00:43:49,539
He's trying
to contact Anna Bergman.

672
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,193
Is she available?

673
00:43:51,237 --> 00:43:52,891
I'm afraid she's gone out.

674
00:43:53,718 --> 00:43:55,937
Perhaps I can help you.

675
00:43:55,981 --> 00:44:00,246
Well, it seems that Anna
is a friend of his daughter.

-Kirsten.
-Kirsten Grosbard.

-She has disappeared.
-Oh, how awful!

678
00:44:05,512 --> 00:44:08,558
And he thought that Anna 
might have some idea 
where she was.

679
00:44:09,821 --> 00:44:12,214
Look, why don't you give me
the information,

680
00:44:12,258 --> 00:44:15,261
and when Anna returns,
I'll have her

681
00:44:15,304 --> 00:44:17,089
call him, okay?

This is Kirsten's father,

It's a matter
of great emergency.

that I speak to her
