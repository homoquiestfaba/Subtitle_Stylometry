1
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,288
One day I woke up
a stiff, slow old man.

2
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,462
Now, I'm just sitting here
day-after-day getting old,

3
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,336
and the older I get,

4
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:20,405
the faster life goes by.

5
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,445
No matter what I try
to do to slow it down,

6
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,717
it just keeps going faster.

7
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,256
What have I done?

8
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,692
Did I do anything,

9
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,496
anything anyone will remember?

10
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:50,435
Anything good?

11
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,599
Do you have any cigarettes?

12
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,437
This has to stop.

13
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,841
Sarah.

14
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,544
This has to stop.

15
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,788
If Tom knew what was going on

16
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,356
I don't even want
to think about it.

17
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,724
I don't love him, Bill.

18
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,626
So get a divorce.

19
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,965
Is your nose bleeding again?

20
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,900
It's fine.

21
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,268
Weather changing or something.

22
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,839
Hey, hey Bill!
Are you in there?

23
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:04,543
Bill, it's me, Tom.
Are you in there?

24
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,479
Do you mind opening the door?

25
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,817
Open the door please!

26
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:18,257
Hey, Bill! Did I wake you up?

27
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:21,660
No, I just spilled some
coffee on myself.

28
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,562
Come on! Really?

29
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:27,633
Oh well, do you happen
to drop the rent last week?

30
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,401
Yeah, I think so, you didn't get it?

31
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:30,769
No, I didn't.

32
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,006
You dropped it with Sarah, didn't you?

33
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:37,809
You give it to her and you might
as well not give it at all.

34
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,244
I'm sorry about that, Tom.
It won't happen again.

35
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:41,413
Come on! No big deal!

36
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,649
I think she's just forgetful
with the checks, right?

37
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,854
Hey, I never got a chance
to properly thank you

38
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:51,023
for helping me out with
the rent the last few months.

39
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,925
It's been a tough time
and I really appreciate it.

40
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,495
Sure, no problem, Bill.

41
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,997
So go ahead and check with Sarah.

42
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,365
If she doesn't have the check,

43
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,701
come on back and
I will give you some cash.

44
00:05:02,703 --> 00:05:06,371
All right, Bill. I'll talk to you later.

45
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:07,739
See you then!

46
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:08,740
Take care!

47
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:09,841
Bye!

48
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:17,849
Fuck!

49
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,683
Bill, what you think I didn't
know where you lived?

50
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,452
You guys just scared the shit out of me.

51
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,687
I thought you were my fucking landlord.

52
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,723
Get in here, close the door.

53
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,861
This is Barry Warner.
He works with me at the DCPI.

54
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,464
Barry, this guy is a real
spit and polish asshole.

55
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:08,900
You do what he says and
you won't end up like me.

56
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,936
You guys want some of this?

57
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,838
No, thanks Bill!

58
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,673
Something to drink, maybe?

59
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,642
No, we're good.

60
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:19,578
Barry, wait outside for me.

61
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:28,453
You really did scare the shit out of me.

62
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:30,655
Yeah, well you take my phone calls

63
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,625
I wouldn't barge in on you like that.

64
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,662
-It's good to see you.
-Right.

65
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,132
The old man sent me down here, Bill.

66
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:41,967
Yeah, I saw him on
the news the other day

67
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:45,904
Nothing is for certain
but we are very optimistic.

68
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:46,972
You're working for Lord now.

69
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:48,407
When I was in the Mayor's detail

70
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,842
I had a few special projects with Lord.

71
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:55,914
Well, nothing quite like
the work you used to do.

72
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,483
The Pharma task force I got
that pushed through last year,

73
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:02,521
so, I'm one of his go-to guys now.

74
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:03,889
You're on his payroll Gunther?

75
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,557
I'm on the city's payroll, Bill.

76
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,592
I'm just doing my part
trying to make a difference.

77
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,797
Also there is a possible promotion.

78
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,398
Of course!

79
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,434
Press Secretary.

80
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,169
That's incredible Gunther.
Congratulations!

81
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,737
Nothing is for certain like I said,

82
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,606
So what, he sent you down
here to assassinate me?

83
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,508
He's got a job for you, Bill.

84
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,944
He wants to put you back to work,

85
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,045
and it's a personal matter.

86
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:30,515
Yeah, he wants to sit
and talk to you face-to-face

87
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,050
and I think it would be good for you.

88
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,819
Gunther, all due respect,

89
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,054
but I don't give a shit about
the old man's personal problems

90
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:39,191
I don't know what happened
between the two of you

91
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:42,761
and I don't want to know,
to be honest with you,

92
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:46,631
So the least you could
do is go over there

93
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,633
and have a conversation with him.

94
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,536
What do you say, Bill?

95
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,638
I don't know. I'll think about it.

96
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,680
What are you doing
for work these days?

97
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:04,716
I'm guessing that's not because
you're banging his wife.

98
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,219
It's none of your goddamn business.

99
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:12,624
This job, Bill, it pays really good money.

100
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:16,928
Really good money, it could
get you out of the house,

101
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,231
by the looks of it, you could really use it.

102
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,871
Listen, Gunther,

103
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,242
we've known each other a long time,

104
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,511
you are a good guy

105
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,713
and I want you to stay a good guy.

106
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,216
Those things they say I did,

107
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,988
those things I lost my badge
over was for real crimes,

108
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,992
I did them.

109
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:58,003
I was a young guy, I wanted
to impress the big boss hog

110
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,105
And look where I end up...

111
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,176
no badge, no pension.

112
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:07,279
I'm fucking broke,

113
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,752
one goddamn DUI away
from a 20-year lockdown.

114
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,662
I broke the law
for that son of a bitch

115
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,664
and I got my fucking
ass handed to me

116
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,233
so if you will excuse me
if I'm not interested

117
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,868
but I'm not.

118
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,944
I'm sorry, Bill.

119
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,278
I understand

120
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,551
but if you change
your mind, give me a call.

121
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:50,221
I'll have a car sent for you,
we'll take care of everything.

122
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:58,563
Okay, Bill. I'll see you.

123
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,599
See you, Gunther.

124
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:19,084
I have imagined explaining
myself to you so many times,

125
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:21,186
so many different ways.

126
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:28,226
Arguments, counter-arguments,
speeches about justice

127
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,830
and the greater good

128
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,898
and how I thought of you as a son.

129
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,103
Now that you are
standing in front of me,

130
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,205
nothing seems to make any sense.

131
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,310
I know my saying this
means nothing to you,

132
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:50,148
my hope is that at
some point in your life

133
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,951
perhaps when you're my age

134
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,953
and not as angry about the things

135
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,187
that have been done to you,

136
00:10:56,189 --> 00:11:01,026
you'll look back on
my words, and if not,

137
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:04,262
understand them, at least believe.

138
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:11,202
My sincere regret; I'm sorry, Bill.

139
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,875
I'm sorry for what
has happened to you.

140
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:20,245
I'm sorry for not backing
you up the way I could have.

141
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,248
I'm sorry for freezing
you out the way I did

142
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,052
when our initiative
began to cave in on us.

143
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:32,657
And I'm going to make it up
to you in some way or another

144
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,393
whether or not you accept
my proposal here today.

145
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,066
Over the past two years
I've had a lot of time

146
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:44,035
to reflect over my choices,

147
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,238
good choices, bad choices,

148
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,443
choices concerning you as well
as other choices in my life.

149
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:56,214
I would like to start correcting
some of these wrongs.

150
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,116
It's quite a change
of heart, Councilman.

151
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,051
Forgive me if I'm a little dubious.

152
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,053
My life is pretty much over, Bill.

153
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,288
You've got a long way to go, John.

154
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,092
Yeah, I probably do but I can see it,

155
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:13,231
and it's a beautiful thing
what life looks like

156
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,433
when you can see
the end in the distance.

157
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,736
You've got a long way to go.

158
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,474
Here's a little token,

159
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:27,512
consolation for all the things
that have happened to you.

160
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,285
$200,000.

161
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,987
What's this about, John?

162
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,993
Hey!

163
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:42,994
Sir!

164
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,863
What are you doing?

165
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,097
You know who you
represent whenever you sit

166
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,432
on the Councilman's
furniture like that?

167
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:53,505
I went to the head,
I lost track of you, sir.

168
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:56,307
If we weren't in the
Councilman's house right now,

169
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:59,310
and smash it against
your fat fucking skull.

170
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:03,114
Detective first grade and you're
already sitting down the job.

171
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,083
You want to be back in the
bull pen running errands?

172
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,084
No, I do not, sir.

173
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,186
You're by my side at all times.

174
00:13:08,188 --> 00:13:09,187
I understand, sir.

175
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,955
You don't sit, you don't squat,

176
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,457
you don't switch off unless I say.

177
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,394
If I catch you playing
with that kids' toy again,

178
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:19,230
this detail is going to be
the least of your problems.

179
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,332
You understand?

180
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:29,207
My daughter, Jessica.

181
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,775
I thought you and Jean couldn't ...

182
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,911
She's not Jean's.

183
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:37,382
Jessica's mother was a
court reporter downtown.

184
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:41,219
I know ridiculous, one of the many

185
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:45,256
but now clichés of
my secret sordid life.

186
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,258
When I found out
she was pregnant,

187
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,197
I paid her to keep it quiet,
I paid her to have an abortion.

188
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:55,033
Needless to say, she
didn't have the abortion.

189
00:13:55,035 --> 00:14:00,004
After a while I lost touch
with her on purpose of course.

190
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,540
I was making a name
for myself in politics

191
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,143
and my financials were
being scrutinized in a way

192
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:07,245
that I couldn't control,

193
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:13,051
I found out that Alexandria had died.

194
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,889
A hit-and-run in Queens.

195
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:23,528
Goddamn animals!

196
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,063
I reached out to Jessica

197
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,532
but she would have
nothing to do with me.

198
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,905
She hates me, Bill.

199
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,507
She hates me.

200
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,243
I'm sorry to hear that.

201
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,848
I recently got word
that she's filed a complaint

202
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:49,187
with the 88th precinct
in Brooklyn, a nuisance stalker.

203
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,356
As you know, the police
department can't do very much

204
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,523
about things like that.

205
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:56,361
I would like you to go down
there and see what you can do.

206
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:59,397
Obviously I'll pay you
a good rate, a day rate,

207
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,233
2500 plus expenses.

208
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:12,043
If she doesn't cooperate,

209
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:15,880
if she tells you to go,

210
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:18,249
just go.

211
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:24,355
So Jessica is a dancer
at the Confessional,

212
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:28,459
I told the old man she was
a cocktail waitress there.

213
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:32,530
And the peeping
Tom isn't just peeping.

214
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:35,500
Some strange phone calls,

215
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:38,169
some letters made
from newspaper clippings,

216
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:41,606
and lately he's been leaving
used condoms in her doorway,

217
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,576
in the mailbox and
window wherever they fit.

218
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,011
Lovely.

219
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,113
You've got plenty in
there to get you started

220
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,416
and here's some
walking around money,

221
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,584
and if you need anything
else just get in touch.

222
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,687
Barry is going to
take you back to town.

223
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,702
Mr. Ivers, I just wanted to say
about the Interborough case.

224
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,270
I don't want to talk about that.

225
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:15,473
I just wanted to say,
despite how they treated you,

226
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:19,077
I respect what you did.

227
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:22,313
I didn't do anything worth respecting.

228
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,150
You color outside the lines,
sometimes it works out,

229
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,758
sometimes you get fucked.

230
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,265
He is a wreck, but he is a good guy,

231
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,567
no matter what happened
between the two of you,

232
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:47,038
Did you give Ivers all
of Jessica's information?

233
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,506
Yes sir, I did.

234
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,707
Thank you, Gunther.

235
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,010
That would be all.

236
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,149
Hello! This is Tom.

237
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:02,153
Leave me a brief message
and I will call you later.

238
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,354
Hi Tom! It's Bill.

239
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,157
I just wanted to let you know that

240
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,593
I had a settlement
that was coming to me,

241
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:12,196
so I'm leaving the money
that I owe you in your mailbox.

242
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:16,000
that I'll be moving out
of the apartment shortly

243
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,369
probably some time this month.

244
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,671
So you can go ahead

245
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:24,242
and keep my deposits since
I'm not giving you much notice

246
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:27,612
and good luck with your next tenant.

247
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:33,651
It was great, honey. Okay.

248
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:34,652
Okay.

249
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:35,753
Bye! Thank you!

250
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,723
I look forward to seeing you again.

251
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,359
Hello there!

252
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,294
You found us.

253
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:46,030
Uh, I'm here  to see Jessica?

254
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,298
You're new here, aren't you?

255
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,666
As a matter of fact I am.

256
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,135
It will be five to see Jessica.

257
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,776
Come with me.

258
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:24,602
Tell me your secret.

259
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:28,239
Tell me your what?

260
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,874
Tell me your secret.

261
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,582
This is uh-huh..

262
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:40,418
Tell me your secret.

263
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:51,729
I've been sleeping
with my landlord's wife,

264
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,664
but I'm moving soon.

265
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,925
Come in.

266
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,464
Oh, I'm sorry but you're
not allowed back here.

267
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,801
You filed a complaint
with the 88th precinct.

268
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,503
Oh, yeah. Who are you
working with on it?

269
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,473
Actually, I'm not working
with the police anymore.

270
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,609
I'm retired.

271
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,445
You know what, you can tell
my Dad, I said, no thanks,

272
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,547
and he can go fuck himself.

273
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,916
That didn't take long.

274
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,985
I wish he would
just fucking die.

275
00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:02,260
He paid me to come down here
and run off your pervert.

276
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:05,496
I'm not interested.

277
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:09,767
but you should know the NYPD
can't do shit for you,

278
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,902
even if they had the resources
to get the job done

279
00:21:11,904 --> 00:21:15,473
which they don't, their
mandate is strictly reactive

280
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,675
in cases like this.

281
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:20,678
Is that cop talk for lousy?

282
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,880
It means they'll do a
great job on your rape kit.

283
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,657
What the hell is this?

284
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:35,493
He's a private investigator,
he's here about the stalker.

285
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:37,428
How are we supposed to afford
a private investigator?

286
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,729
We're not.

287
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:43,801
Listen, I need the
money, they came early.

288
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,935
Could you get
them out of here?

289
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,304
This is where I work.

290
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,538
I will.

291
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:16,334
So you want to do this alone then?

292
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,935
Yes.

293
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,371
Okay.

294
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:25,042
In case you change your mind.

295
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:27,745
Good luck with your stalker.

296
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,788
Gunther, it's Bill.

297
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,056
Sorry man!
It's not going to work out.

298
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,025
She saw right through me.

299
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,361
She doesn't want anything
to do with the old man.

300
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:47,031
I can't say I blame her.

301
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,667
Give me a call back if you will.

302
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,396
Hello Bill!

303
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,632
I figured I'd stop
in and say goodbye

304
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,968
since you are moving.

305
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,771
Sarah! No!

306
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:29,707
No! You need to get
the fuck out of here

307
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,375
before that husband
of yours comes down here

308
00:23:31,377 --> 00:23:32,777
and cuts my head off.

309
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:37,047
Bill, stop being
such a drama queen.

310
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,891
So where are you moving?

311
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:48,993
Away.

312
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,799
You don't want to tell me?

313
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:58,402
No, I do not.

314
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:00,704
You know what I think,

315
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,774
I think you're going
to miss me when you leave.

316
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,776
You're probably right.

317
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:15,453
So if you know you're
going to miss me,

318
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:19,023
why don't you take me with you?

319
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:20,458
Oh, my God!

320
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,623
Hi! My name is Jamie
and I'm an alcoholic.

321
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,658
Hi Jamie!

322
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:00,231
I've been sober for 46 days,
12 hours and 54 minutes.

323
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:02,500
Thank you!

324
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:06,203
that's exactly the last
time I had a drink.

325
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:11,175
Because I love you, you stupid bitch.

326
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:16,113
no matter what kind of shit
you pull I will not quit you.

327
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:18,215
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

328
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,819
Jesus Christ!

329
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,587
You're impossible!

330
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,689
You know what, Maybe
I should put your head

331
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,657
through the fucking wall.

332
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,993
Oh, yeah. Why don't you?

333
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:31,629
Don't test me.

334
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:34,064
I don't smoke.

335
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:36,800
Good.

336
00:25:36,802 --> 00:25:39,503
I miss it, I miss it a lot.

337
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:42,806
I haven't been to
a meeting for a while

338
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:46,076
but I almost relapsed last
night so that's why I'm here.

339
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:50,214
I had a fight with my mother
and that always triggers.

340
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,683
She doesn't understand
why I'm sober.

341
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:55,686
She didn't realize I had a problem

342
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:56,954
none of my friends did either.

343
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,089
I was really, really
good at hiding it.

344
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,090
Hey Bill!

345
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,225
What will it be?

346
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:06,096
The same, give me
something terrible.

347
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,097
How are you doing today?

348
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,767
No complaints?

349
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,001
Yeah, none at all.

350
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,304
It's been very difficult for me.

351
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:17,675
I've been sober for about
five months and six days now

352
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:18,809
and I'm just

353
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:21,812
thank you.

354
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:25,082
I'm just grateful that I have
my family and God

355
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:29,320
and the support group to
help me get through this.

356
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:31,989
So let me get out of here.

357
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:33,757
Any interest in coming along?

358
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,560
Bill!

359
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:39,763
Hopefully with the help
of my support group,

360
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:42,766
my friends and my family

361
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:46,637
I can finally rid myself
of this insidious disease

362
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:49,139
and try to live a normal life

363
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,275
so I can be there for my family

364
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:52,843
and my children

365
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:56,313
and also when my children
have children

366
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:58,716
they can look at their grandfather

367
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:01,251
and be proud of what he has

368
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:03,887
and what he's become

369
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:05,789
and I would just like to

370
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,858
thank you for inviting me here

371
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,096
and hopefully I can
be clean and sober

372
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:15,132
and we could all live a great life.

373
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,367
Thank you!

374
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,210
You're looking a little
raw this evening.

375
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:31,649
My money is still green.

376
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:33,751
Come on!

377
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,727
Tell me your secret.

378
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:51,969
I'm dying.

379
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:01,245
It's been 2 years and 27 days
since I've had a drink.

380
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:07,251
Most of you know me
and know my story.

381
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:09,086
I'm just trying to take
it one day at a time,

382
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,722
stay clean, stay upright.

383
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:18,395
It's tough but I'm here
to tell you it's worth it.

384
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,097
A lot of people will sit here
and they'll tell you about

385
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:23,033
all the bad things
that drinking made them do

386
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,968
and it's true.

387
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,971
It's going to take your life away

388
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:30,874
and take everything
that you love away.

389
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,847
But getting clean, getting
clean is the greatest thing

390
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:40,117
that ever happened to
me in my life, bar none.

391
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:44,088
Everyday that I spend clean
I thank God for the chance

392
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,890
to live a good life, a clean life,

393
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:52,129
but I don't want to
focus on the weakness,

394
00:28:52,131 --> 00:28:54,131
I want to focus on the strength

395
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:56,934
because it takes a hell of a lot
of strength to beat this thing.

396
00:28:56,936 --> 00:29:00,904
Everyday it takes strength,
it's a force of will.

397
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:08,145
You've got to visualize your
life the way you want it to be,

398
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:16,220
visualize yourself as the man or
woman that you want to become,

399
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:19,723
self-actualization,

400
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:23,393
to become one's true potential

401
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,395
and that's a beautiful thing.

402
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,365
And anyone of you can do it,

403
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,733
anyone can do it.

404
00:29:29,735 --> 00:29:32,336
Huh!

405
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:35,105
It just takes strength.

406
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:41,044
And you've got to hold yourself
to that higher standard.

407
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,513
Thank you!

408
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,438
Hello!

409
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,488
Hello!

410
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,893
Jessica.

411
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,165
There's no damage on the locks.

412
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,468
I don't see how he got in here
without climbing over you guys.

413
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,270
How can he just come
in here and do that

414
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:44,875
Yeah, did you go to
bed drunk or high?

415
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:47,878
All right, so who else
got keys to this place?

416
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,314
The landlady but she
is as big as a house.

417
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:52,850
How about you sport,
did you give out any keys?

418
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:53,851
What the fuck that's
supposed to mean?

419
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:54,952
Let me put it in a different way.

420
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:56,153
Any of your dirt bag friends

421
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,421
have keys to your girlfriend's pad?

422
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:59,223
-What?
-Don't talk to me like that.

423
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:01,525
I know what she does.

424
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,293
But what exactly is
that you do, Duane?

425
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,395
I am a real estate broker, asshole.

426
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:06,530
What the fuck do you think you are?

427
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:09,399
to solve your girlfriend's
problems, Einstein?

428
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,001
So how about you drop the attitude

429
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:13,503
Why don't you just
get the fuck out of here?

430
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:16,273
We've lived here
together for five years

431
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:20,210
We changed the locks the
month after we moved in.

432
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,113
Nobody has keys,
not even the landlady.

433
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:28,151
All right, well, change
those locks again.

434
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:30,888
Where is this, gift?

435
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,124
We tried not to touch
anything since we found it.

436
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,430
All right, I'll check it out.

437
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,135
We got the first note
about three months ago.

438
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:49,406
First, he was just calling
and breathing over the phone.

439
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:53,010
Then he started leaving
things in the mailbox,

440
00:31:53,012 --> 00:31:54,278
really gross things.

441
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,581
There is no pattern,
sometimes it's every night,

442
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,883
sometimes it's once a week.

443
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:02,886
Did the detective at the 88th
take any evidence from you?

444
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:06,390
You mean the dirty
condoms and panties?

445
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:09,159
No, they told me
to throw them away.

446
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10,494
I did keep some of the letters though,

447
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,463
I thought it will be dumb
to get rid of them.

448
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:55,272
This is a cash business, Mr. Ivers.

449
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:59,276
No ledgers, no names, no cameras.

450
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:00,677
What about security?

451
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,380
We've never had any need.

452
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:05,015
Right, well, I'm going
to have to start

453
00:33:05,017 --> 00:33:09,052
I'm sorry, but that's
out of the question.

454
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:11,054
That would be a total breach of trust.

455
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:12,422
Jessica talked to you about this, right?

456
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,991
You know this guy broke into her place.

457
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,059
We don't know if it
was one of her clients.

458
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,627
I'll be very discreet, okay?

459
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:20,397
I'd just be hanging
around just a barfly.

460
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,400
I'm sorry but I can't allow it.

461
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,168
How much is this going to cost?

462
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,738
This is a matter of principle, Mr. Ivers.

463
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,340
It sounds like about 250 a night.

464
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:33,710
I would never betray my
clientele for such a..

465
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:37,447
500?

466
00:33:37,449 --> 00:33:38,982
1,000.

467
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:41,585
Well, I'm not made of money
so we'll call it seven

468
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:44,588
and drinks are on the house.

469
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:49,626
You observe only and you
do so surreptitiously.

470
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:53,630
No interrogating or
intimidating my customers.

471
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:57,234
I don't like police, or police tactics.

472
00:33:57,236 --> 00:34:00,737
Well, lucky for you, I'm not one.

473
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,140
And he pays for his own drinks.

474
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,017
Look, if you're going to help me

475
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:16,119
I have a few conditions.

476
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:20,223
First, nobody in my life
knows about my father,

477
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,291
especially not Duane.

478
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,393
I need it to stay that way.

479
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,397
Second, I don't want you involved

480
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,765
in my personal business.

481
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,100
Just deal with the
weirdo and that's it.

482
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:31,435
I don't need a life coach.

483
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:32,736
Good!

484
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,272
The last thing is, I'm
probably fucking stupid

485
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:37,474
for even thinking
that you'll honor this

486
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,709
but I don't want you talking
about me to my father.

487
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:40,811
Yeah.

488
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,382
Are you okay, baby?

489
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:47,484
Yeah.

490
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,089
So I got prints off this stuff.

491
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:55,092
See what you can match it to.

492
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:58,361
Sick fuck broke in her
place while she was sleeping.

493
00:34:58,363 --> 00:34:59,362
How's she doing?

494
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:02,599
And I've got to hand it to
her, the girl's all business.

495
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,401
-And how you're doing?
-I'm fine.

496
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:06,103
What's up with the shiner, Bill?

497
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:07,737
It's none of your business.

498
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,372
So how long is it going
to be to get some results

499
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,575
back on this stuff?

500
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,610
A couple of weeks.

501
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:14,578
-All right.
-Okay.

502
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,079
Keep me posted.

503
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,281
I will.

504
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,423
This is Bill Ivers, leave a message

505
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:28,692
at the sound of the tone.

506
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:30,627
Hi Bill! This is Tom.

507
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,096
I've been calling you the whole day.

508
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:35,699
I would like to talk with
you about your moving.

509
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:39,336
You know where to find me, let's
talk about you moving, okay?

510
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:40,437
I'll wait for your answer.

511
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:42,839
Thanks! Bye!

512
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:02,659
How many more nights do you
plan on haunting my bar?

513
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,227
I'll keep you posted.

514
00:36:04,229 --> 00:36:06,830
Well, this can't go on forever.

515
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,732
What do you care,
you're getting paid.

516
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:14,871
I told you, Mr. Ivers, this
business is based on trust.

517
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:19,342
Your presence here is
a breach of that trust.

518
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,611
I can see you're all
broken up about it.

519
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,547
I resent that.

520
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,882
Just because I work in
alternative entertainment

521
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:28,351
doesn't mean I lack integrity.

522
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,554
All right, you know, just save it, okay?

523
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,422
I'm not here because it's fun for me.

524
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:35,258
Piece of shit isn't just jerking
off in her mailbox anymore.

525
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,494
Are you implying that I don't
care about Jessica's welfare?

526
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:39,563
No. As far as I can see

527
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:41,831
you're making a goddamn
fortune off of her,

528
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:43,400
which is why you have every reason

529
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:44,768
to be concerned about her welfare

530
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,870
so why don't you just get
the fuck off of my back

531
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,472
and let's get the shit over with?

532
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:50,740
You've got till the end of the week.

533
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:51,741
Thanks for your help.

534
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:52,909
Uh-huh.

535
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:00,483
I don't need a new deadline.

536
00:37:00,485 --> 00:37:03,587
I need you to meet me at the mark.

537
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:05,889
Tell Yates not to worry
I'll be there soon.

538
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:07,757
No, I don't need to --

539
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,626
just tell Yates I'll be there soon.

540
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:11,628
Bye!

541
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,231
Duane?

542
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:19,369
That call, that I hear you mention Yates?

543
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,670
What call?

544
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:22,606
Duane, Yates?

545
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:23,974
That's who you owe money to?

546
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,212
Hey, I'm not fucking around.

547
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:32,616
Duane, if you own money to
Yates and you don't pay,

548
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,684
I know that guy, he will
put you in the ground.

549
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:35,652
Listen to me.

550
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:37,254
One, take your hands off.

551
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:38,788
Two, it's none of your business.

552
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:43,360
Three, I can handle Yates' guys
I've been doing it for years.

553
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:46,630
Duane, you don't know
what you're dealing with.

554
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:51,868
Just get rid of that stalker
and get out of our lives.

555
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:21,665
He's given me some evidence
and I'm having it analyzed.

556
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:22,966
What kind of evidence?

557
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,768
Some letters from the suspect.

558
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,403
Are they telling?

559
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:27,971
Sir?

560
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:31,608
The letters to my daughter?

561
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,710
Barry, would you wait
outside for a second?

562
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:39,983
Sir, I thought I was heading
up this investigation?

563
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,285
Look, I know what I said, Gunther.

564
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,654
Tell me what's in the letters?

565
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:48,491
Some crude remarks about her
appearance and lifestyle, sir,

566
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,593
and that he is watching her.

567
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,464
I'd like to see those letters, Gunther.

568
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:02,505
I'll have them photocopied and
brought to you this afternoon.

569
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:06,343
Look, I don't mean to gum up
your work, Gunther,

570
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:08,778
but I'd like appraisals of her situation

571
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,847
on an as-available basis

572
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:14,617
and I prefer not to have
to ask you for details.

573
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,453
Absolutely, sir, sorry.

574
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:19,389
You wouldn't keep anything
from me, would you, Gunther?

575
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:21,424
No sir, I would not.

576
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,631
The stripper at the club
she is his daughter.

577
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,500
Set up a meeting with Yates.

578
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:31,901
No details. Just set up a meeting.

579
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,036
I'll be available.

580
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:33,870
Hey!

581
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,410
Let's go get some lunch.

582
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:53,690
Hey!

583
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:55,558
Hey!

584
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,926
How did everything go last night?

585
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,428
All clear.

586
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,530
I got these for you guys.

587
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,365
Thank you!

588
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,099
Nothing for you?

589
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:04,667
No, I'm heading home.

590
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:05,902
I'm going to get some sleep.

591
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:08,538
Does it get boring
standing around out here?

592
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,442
I hope it's not weird having
me out of here all night.

593
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:16,045
I think it's weird for Duane,
but it helps me sleep better.

594
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:18,581
Honestly, I just want this to be over.

595
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,517
It will be soon, I promise.

596
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,619
You promise, really?

597
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,087
I do.

598
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,655
Well, I'm going to hold you to that.

599
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:28,925
Go right ahead.

600
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,161
Got a wife waiting up for you?

601
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:32,662
No.

602
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,531
I had you pegged as a family man?

603
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,533
I don't think anybody has
ever said that to me before.

604
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:38,067
What gave you that idea?

605
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:42,405
I don't know, all the little
phrases calling Duane, Einstein,

606
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:45,575
kind of reminded me
of those dads on TV.

607
00:40:45,577 --> 00:40:47,811
How about you guys, how
long have you been together?

608
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:51,114
A long time, almost eight years.

609
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,182
That is a long time.

610
00:40:52,184 --> 00:40:55,685
Yeah, tell me about it.

611
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:59,722
How long has Duane
owed money to Yates?

612
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:02,058
He's not some street punk, Jessica.

613
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,060
You stay out of this.

614
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:07,864
I know that boyfriend of yours
is going to get himself killed.

615
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:10,533
Stay out of it!

616
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:41,798
So have you found a new place yet?

617
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,667
I haven't even had a chance
to start looking yet.

618
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,870
This gig's really taking it out of me.

619
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:50,773
You know what?

620
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:56,112
I think this is our first date.

621
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,717
You know, I have to say,

622
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,654
I'm glad, we might not
be losing you so soon.

623
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:08,525
Sarah, you are losing me for good.

624
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,734
You're breaking my
heart, you know that?

625
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:20,837
After this job is over I'm going away.

626
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,540
How long?

627
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,642
I won't be back, Sarah.

628
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,550
You know what's funny?

629
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,818
I thought you are going
to ask me to marry you.

630
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:47,297
Excuse me!

631
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:54,003
Hello!

632
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:55,305
No, not right now.

633
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,175
I'll be staking out
the apartment tonight,

634
00:42:59,177 --> 00:43:01,578
just trying to be there around nine.

635
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:25,201
The fucking buyers has walked
out of the goddamn closing,

636
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:29,772
I don't have a shit for them
and it's fucking Thursday.

637
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,808
Why didn't you tell me
you were short this month?

638
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,076
The fuck do you want
me to do, Jessica?

639
00:43:33,078 --> 00:43:34,277
They're right outside.

640
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:35,311
I'm calling the police.

641
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:38,948
Yates owns the fucking police.

642
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,283
What are you doing?

643
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:42,685
I'm doing what I have to do.

644
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,591
Where did you get that?

645
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:50,693
I got it for emergencies.

646
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:54,797
Howdy, boys?

647
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:05,241
Listen, if I don't go out there
they're going to come in here,

648
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:10,313
and then that's going
to be a big fucking mess.

649
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:11,781
Duane, what are you doing?

650
00:44:11,783 --> 00:44:13,683
The fuck is he doing here?

651
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:15,685
Give me that goddamn gun right now.

652
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:18,621
I'm just going to go out there
and explain the situation.

653
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:19,956
That's not how it's going to go down.

654
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:21,324
You don't know anything about us.

655
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:24,694
You think you know what's
going on here but you don't.

656
00:44:24,696 --> 00:44:27,764
Whatever the situation is
with these guys outside

657
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:30,700
stays between us, all right?

658
00:44:30,702 --> 00:44:34,671
So do I have your
permission to help or not?

659
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:36,406
Yes.

660
00:44:36,408 --> 00:44:39,942
Just stand over here, please!

661
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:43,413
Whoa, whoa, listen,
I've got this under control.

662
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:44,981
Ah!

663
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:49,986
Ow, motherfucker, that hurt!

664
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:51,988
Put some ice on it.

665
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,229
If you don't see me again

666
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,699
and the cops come
knocking for any reason,

667
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:05,368
and you've never seen any
of these people in your life

668
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,836
including me.

669
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:07,837
You got it?

670
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,272
Uh-huh.

671
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:11,674
How much do you owe
these cocksuckers?

672
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:13,076
32 grand.

673
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:19,182
As of tomorrow Yates is no
longer a problem for you.

674
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:22,251
You're paying them off?

675
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:23,853
I'll let you explain it.

676
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:35,131
So I understand these
kids owe you some money.

677
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:38,234
I'm the guy that just
bought Duane's debt.

678
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:42,238
So why don't you guys come
around the corner with me,

679
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,974
Nah, we ain't going anywhere, man!

680
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:46,876
I don't think Mr. Yates
would be too happy

681
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:49,145
about you guys turning
down a full pay out.

682
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:52,115
So come on, in my car, get your bread,

683
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:54,217
and get this thing over with.

684
00:45:56,488 --> 00:46:00,256
I need you to get your
fucking ass over here.

685
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:04,026
I'm going to be in the
alley behind the building.

686
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:06,129
I need your help.

687
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:10,399
Thank you for waiting, gentlemen,

688
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:13,202
I got your money here
32,000, payment in full.

689
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:14,871
32,000?

690
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:16,472
What's he up to now, 45 grand?

691
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:18,441
47k with a convenience fee.

692
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,376
It's a pretty substantial
convenience fee.

693
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:21,778
Yes, it is.

694
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,912
Which one of you is Wilma?

695
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:23,980
I'm Wilma.

696
00:46:23,982 --> 00:46:25,515
So you must be Mac.
Listen, man!

697
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:27,350
I'm done playing games with
you so you either you pay up

698
00:46:27,352 --> 00:46:29,051
or we head on to Duane's place.

699
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:31,087
Only this time we don't wait outside.

700
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:33,222
All right, first of all,
you guys go fuck yourself.

701
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:35,825
32 is what's left on the
marker, 32 is what you get.

702
00:46:35,827 --> 00:46:37,860
Second, I give you this money

703
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:39,529
and you don't bother
these kids anymore.

704
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:41,898
There's no point you camping on
in front of this place anyway.

705
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,366
These kids are long gone.

706
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:47,537
So why don't you just take
this money and pack it in.

707
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:49,272
This is bullshit.

708
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,016
Bill, what's going on?

709
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,484
Gunther, you made it.

710
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:36,953
Honestly Bill I don't
even know where to start.

711
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:38,855
What the hell is going on with you?

712
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:42,425
I got my ass kicked by a couple
of Brooklyn tomato gang.

713
00:47:42,427 --> 00:47:44,393
I'm not talking about that, Bill.

714
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:47,063
I'm talking about you.
I'm talking about your life.

715
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:49,832
I'm talking about who you used
to be and who you are now.

716
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:50,967
Jesus Christ!

717
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:52,401
No, you need to hear this.

718
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:55,571
of the New York City Police Department.

719
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:59,075
Getting drunk on stale wine
and eating shit off the floor.

720
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:00,109
I don't remember the
last time I've seen you

721
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:02,211
without a bruise on your face.

722
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,547
What the fuck happened to you, man?

723
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,549
Why the fuck did you just give up?

724
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:15,858
You know what your problem is?

725
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,627
What's my problem, Gunther?

726
00:48:17,629 --> 00:48:19,962
You lack self-actualization.

727
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,901
You have the intelligence,
you have the ability,

728
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:26,903
you have the means,

729
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:29,205
but you just can't make it happen.

730
00:48:29,207 --> 00:48:32,308
Okay.

731
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:36,178
Honestly, I'm worried about you.

732
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,581
I'm worried about your
future on this planet.

733
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:13,129
Anybody else here?

734
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:17,333
Eh, uh!

735
00:52:17,335 --> 00:52:18,434
Come on.

736
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,389
Lovely.

737
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,662
Benny Reardon.

738
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,330
That's a good pervert name.

739
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:50,699
What are you doing?
You going  kill me?

740
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:51,734
Shut up!

741
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:54,336
Hey! I've got an idea,
I need you to run.

742
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,438
Yeah, give me two minutes
to get to the car.

743
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,474
All right.

744
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:00,676
Can you wipe my face, please?

745
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:06,482
Okay, shoot.

746
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:08,484
All right.

747
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:16,225
Benny Reardon, white
male, New York 198 7628.

748
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:17,726
Yeah, I got him.

749
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:19,695
It looks like he's clean-ish.

750
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,498
He's got a minor domestic
assault charge from ages ago,

751
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,633
a couple of tickets for public toilet.

752
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:26,202
It looks like he was
institutionalized

753
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:27,403
for a couple of years.

754
00:53:27,405 --> 00:53:28,604
He is on disability.

755
00:53:28,606 --> 00:53:29,605
What did he do?

756
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:30,839
Do you want me to send a car over?

757
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:32,808
No, I'll call you back in a minute.

758
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:55,798
Benny, right?

759
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,900
Yeah.

760
00:53:57,902 --> 00:53:59,902
My name is Bill.

761
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,338
Why did you hit me with the door?

762
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,440
I'm sorry about that, I thought
you might be dangerous.

763
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:08,877
No, you hit me in the head with a door.

764
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:11,247
All right, all right. Just, just relax.

765
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:15,384
So that house you
went through tonight,

766
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:16,819
you know who lives in that house?

767
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:18,721
What house?

768
00:54:18,723 --> 00:54:20,322
Benny, I saw you there, all right?

769
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:22,291
Do you know who lives there or not?

770
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:27,763
A pretty girl lives there.

771
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:30,532
That's right.

772
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:33,569
You know what day of
the week it is, Benny?

773
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:36,438
Ah, Monday.

774
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,873
Wait, wait.

775
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:40,709
What is it, Thursday?

776
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:42,845
Remember what you had
for dinner last night?

777
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:48,851
How old are you, Benny?

778
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:51,754
Ah, 29.

779
00:54:51,756 --> 00:54:53,756
Have you got any parents or relatives

780
00:54:53,758 --> 00:54:55,758
who could help take care of you?

781
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:06,735
My mom is dead and I don't have dad.

782
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,574
Must gets lonely for you around here.

783
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:18,781
Loneliness makes people
do strange things sometimes.

784
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:22,618
I saw her on the subway.

785
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:29,358
She was just so beautiful.

786
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:32,695
Have you ever seen
anyone more beautiful?

787
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:34,997
No.

788
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:40,369
I just wanted to show
her how special she was.

789
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:47,343
You know, get something
really special for her.

790
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:50,879
But I'm kind of shy.

791
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:58,053
I hope I didn't scare her.

792
00:55:58,055 --> 00:56:02,791
Oh, my god, did I scare her?

793
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:05,060
I'm always scaring people.

794
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:08,897
Maybe I could go and
tell her that I'm sorry.

795
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:10,032
Maybe that would help.

796
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:12,668
Hey! I want you to listen to me.

797
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:16,338
You are not to go to that house again.

798
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,540
You don't walk down that street.

799
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,609
When you see that girl coming
you walk in the other direction,

800
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:21,610
you got me?

801
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:23,479
Okay.

802
00:56:23,481 --> 00:56:25,781
It's for the best, Benny.

803
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:27,683
I'm going to be watching.

804
00:56:27,685 --> 00:56:30,386
Okay.

805
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,087
Sorry.

806
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,293
Goodnight, Benny.

807
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,400
Hey, I met our friend last night

808
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:46,001
and I had a talk with him.

809
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:48,003
I don't think you'd
be seeing him again.

810
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:51,373
Why? Did you kill him or something?

811
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:52,441
No, Duane.

812
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:54,910
Who was he? Do we get to know?

813
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,378
His name is Benny Reardon.

814
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,046
You know him?

815
00:56:58,048 --> 00:56:59,782
I didn't think so.

816
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:02,151
He's just a confused kid,
didn't know any better.

817
00:57:02,153 --> 00:57:04,386
You make him sound
like he's a lost puppy

818
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:06,955
who breaks into our place
and jerks off in our bathroom.

819
00:57:06,957 --> 00:57:09,725
Actually, I don't know how
he got in here clean like that.

820
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:12,594
He's got a bad leg, he
doesn't move around so good,

821
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,130
I don't see him defeating
your lock either.

822
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:17,466
He's not exactly the
manual dexterity type.

823
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:19,034
Are you sure he is the right guy?

824
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:23,672
I caught him right outside your
place with one of his gifts.

825
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:28,710
Yeah, that kind.

826
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:36,919
Listen, if something
does happen again

827
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:38,120
he is on our radar now,

828
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,956
we can do something about it quickly.

829
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,659
But I honestly don't think
you can have anymore problems

830
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:46,862
Well, thank you, thank you
for taking care of this.

831
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:48,764
You're welcome!

832
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:52,768
I'm glad I could come through for you.

833
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:53,936
It's going to be awhile before you..

834
00:57:53,938 --> 00:57:56,038
Just don't.

835
00:57:57,006 --> 00:58:01,043
Please leave now!

836
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:03,145
All right.

837
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:11,854
Jessica, I know you don't want
to hear this right now,

838
00:58:11,856 --> 00:58:13,822
but it's time you started
thinking long and hard

839
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:16,859
about that guy you're with.

840
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:20,529
I know you love him and
you think he loves you,

841
00:58:20,531 --> 00:58:23,532
but the way he put you in
danger the other night

842
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:28,170
it could've been a death
sentence for the both of you.

843
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:31,073
Have you ever heard of
someone named Conrad Barnes?

844
00:58:31,075 --> 00:58:32,641
The pimp?

845
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:37,913
I'm only going to tell you this
because I believe you will honor

846
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:41,550
our agreement that you not
inform on me to my father.

847
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:42,851
Okay.

848
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,724
I had already left home
before my mother died

849
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:54,162
that she shipped me off
to I got in with Conrad Barnes.

850
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:56,899
Why, it doesn't make sense.

851
00:58:56,901 --> 00:58:58,634
It was insane.

852
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:01,236
No. I mean, it doesn't make sense.

853
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:04,006
Your dad, he's got contacts
in the department.

854
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:07,976
You filed your stalker complaint
and he knew inside of a week.

855
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:10,078
How could he not know
that you are turning tricks?

856
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,947
I was completely out of his life then

857
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:14,917
and I was under alias, Ashley Smith.

858
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:18,954
So he had you under contract?

859
00:59:18,956 --> 00:59:22,524
I had a two-year deal with Barnes.

860
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:26,094
I met Duane two months
into my second year.

861
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:29,031
And he borrowed money
from Yates to buy you out.

862
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:33,068
Yeah, $52,000.

863
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,604
We've been paying it off
for the last seven years.

864
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:37,639
Not anymore, you're not.

865
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:43,812
I don't know what kind of slush
fund my father gives you,

866
00:59:43,814 --> 00:59:46,048
but I'd really prefer
this not get back to him.

867
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,685
It won't, because it wasn't his money.

868
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,141
In case you owe us the last one,

869
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:16,678
if you ever need anything
my address is on the card.

870
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,180
I mean it, Duane.

871
01:00:18,182 --> 01:00:21,650
I'd be around for you guys
as long as I'm around.

872
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:23,218
All right.

873
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:26,321
Thanks for helping us!

874
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:27,823
You're welcome!

875
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:30,158
Take care of each other!

876
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,949
Thanks for coming, Bill!

877
01:00:53,951 --> 01:00:56,818
I realize it's a long trip up here

878
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,254
for something that could've
been arranged remotely.

879
01:00:59,256 --> 01:01:01,790
That's really no problem.

880
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:04,960
You sent for a man a
couple dozen times a year,

881
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:08,296
doesn't respond much less show you up.

882
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:11,233
Then you pay him a couple $100,000

883
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:16,071
and suddenly that two-and-a-half
hour long trek from the city

884
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:18,106
is no problem.

885
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:19,808
I thought Gunther
would be here tonight.

886
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:23,645
Yeah, well, he is busy at the
office preparing an announcement

887
01:01:23,647 --> 01:01:24,980
for later tonight.

888
01:01:24,982 --> 01:01:27,983
Good news I hope.

889
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:30,018
I'm not going to sugarcoat things, Bill.

890
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,855
I don't appreciate being kept
in the dark about my daughter.

891
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:34,856
Come again?

892
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,658
I know about the sex club.

893
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,660
My people have
informed me about it

894
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:40,862
while they were verifying
your reports.

895
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,197
Verifying my reports?

896
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,166
You didn't think I'd
send you into the fields

897
01:01:44,168 --> 01:01:45,967
without oversight?

898
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:48,003
Well, first of all, she is
not working in a sex club.

899
01:01:48,005 --> 01:01:54,209
My own flesh and blood, Bill;
my own daughter in the back,

900
01:01:54,211 --> 01:02:02,317
how that goddamn seedy hole
with the scum of society

901
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:08,123
touching every part
of her body for a buck

902
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:11,860
and you just sitting there watching.

903
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:14,262
Let me ask you something, Bill.

904
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:16,832
If the roles were reversed,

905
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:19,968
do you think I would keep that
kind of information from you,

906
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:21,803
your own flesh and blood?

907
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:23,839
You've got the wrong
information, Councilman.

908
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:26,174
Oh, I don't think I have
the wrong information.

909
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:30,112
Does Ashley Smith ring a bell?

910
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:32,981
She's turning tricks for Conrad Barnes

911
01:02:32,983 --> 01:02:38,053
Now we can argue about whether
I was being kept in the dark?

912
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,857
Gunther and I mutually decided..

913
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:42,991
Let's not blame Gunther,

914
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:44,893
and I'm dealing with him separately.

915
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:47,863
I'm not blaming Gunther, John.

916
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:50,732
I'm just saying,

917
01:02:50,734 --> 01:02:53,335
Gunther and I mutually decided

918
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:56,304
that Jessica's vocation in the club

919
01:02:56,306 --> 01:02:58,840
was a separate issue we
would deal with it separately.

920
01:02:58,842 --> 01:03:03,512
You cut me out, Bill, pure and simple.

921
01:03:03,514 --> 01:03:06,414
You knew Jessica was lost to the dregs,

922
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:11,253
I wouldn't stand for it, but
you still wanted to get paid,

923
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:14,055
is the same old Bill.

924
01:03:14,057 --> 01:03:20,495
You know, friend, you're
a goddamn expenditure.

925
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:23,031
Your name is Bill for Christ sakes!

926
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:25,267
I want you to take your money

927
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:29,137
and I want you to get the hell out.

928
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,906
We're through.

929
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:37,145
Let me tell you something
about your daughter, Councilman.

930
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:39,981
You may not approve of the way
that she has lived her life,

931
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:43,852
she has made some mistakes sure.

932
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:48,089
She is a good woman,
and a little more honest

933
01:03:48,091 --> 01:03:49,858
than we ever were.

934
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:59,601
Sorry about your
reconciliation, I mean it.

935
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:21,289
Sarah, I'm a bit surprised.

936
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:25,594
I knew you're going to be home
today I didn't want to miss you.

937
01:04:25,596 --> 01:04:28,496
Well, you didn't so now you can go.

938
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:30,365
I know something is wrong, Bill.

939
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,467
I realize that you were
trying to tell me something

940
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:37,138
What I was trying to tell you,
is exactly what I told you.

941
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:42,310
It's about the nosebleeds, isn't it?

942
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:45,380
You're sick with something, aren't you?

943
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:49,417
We've always been honest
with each other, Bill.

944
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:52,053
You can be honest about this too.

945
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:58,593
Sarah, go home!

946
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:00,495
Tom!

947
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:01,963
Go home!

948
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:22,918
After everything I did to try helping you,

949
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,554
I thought we were friends.

950
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:30,091
You've got three days
to get out of my building

951
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:33,528
or I promise I am going
to move you out myself.

952
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:38,633
I trusted you and you fucked me.

953
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,635
Hey! You're home?

954
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:35,450
Your phone is ringing.

955
01:07:35,452 --> 01:07:36,584
Hey, Gunther!

956
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:37,585
Great news.

957
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:39,087
Just came from the announcement.

958
01:07:39,089 --> 01:07:41,556
I'm going to be Press Secretary.

959
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:45,026
It's going to be a great night, buddy.

960
01:07:45,028 --> 01:07:46,795
Gunther, we need to talk.

961
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:51,533
You cracked your case
and I got my promotion.

962
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,170
Gunther, something
very bad is happening.

963
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:57,105
To us, buddy!

964
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:02,343
Your phone is still ringing.

965
01:08:06,683 --> 01:08:09,084
Gunther, I've got a fucking
situation here;

966
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:10,151
I need your help with.

967
01:08:10,153 --> 01:08:12,754
What's the story with this Roscoe?

968
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:17,158
This is the felony weapon
stretch, my friend.

969
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:21,563
What the fuck you mean take me in?

970
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:22,597
Stand up!

971
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,099
Are you going to take me in?

972
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:25,733
It's fucking bullshit, Gunther!

973
01:08:28,138 --> 01:08:29,838
I'm just fucking with you, Bill.

974
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,673
Relax!

975
01:08:31,675 --> 01:08:36,177
Oh before I forget, the results
came back from the lab.

976
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:40,181
Do you know whose prints
were on that last letter?

977
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:42,217
Mine.

978
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:45,620
The old man is just
too weak and brittle,

979
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:47,856
he didn't have the backbone
to do what needs to be done.

980
01:08:47,858 --> 01:08:50,625
He may had before
but he doesn't now.

981
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:53,561
I can't just leave you on
the icebox's liability.

982
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:56,197
You've got too much shit going
too far back on the old man.

983
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:58,867
Eventually, you'd fuck us all.

984
01:08:58,869 --> 01:09:02,203
I always knew you were a psycho fuck.

985
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:04,772
Yeah, you should've known.

986
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:08,610
I thought you did but I guess you didn't.

987
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:12,547
And the girl,

988
01:09:12,549 --> 01:09:15,350
too convenient.

989
01:09:15,352 --> 01:09:17,585
You always had a weakness
for the wrong lady.

990
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:22,824
So I guess I'll be shooting
myself in the head tonight.

991
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:25,593
If you just hadn't fucked up
on that Interborough bullshit,

992
01:09:25,595 --> 01:09:28,296
that was lazy, sloppy work, Ivers.

993
01:09:28,298 --> 01:09:29,464
You just needed to buckle down,

994
01:09:29,466 --> 01:09:32,133
have some fucking self-actualization.

995
01:09:32,135 --> 01:09:33,535
Bill!

996
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,343
How's that for self-actualization

997
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,279
you son of a bitch?

998
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:46,247
They took Jessica.

999
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:52,720
We have Lord's daughter,
bring $250,000

1000
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:54,756
in non-sequential hundred dollar bills

1001
01:09:54,758 --> 01:09:57,225
in a black athletic bag to Ericsson Field

1002
01:09:57,227 --> 01:09:58,826
by 6:00 P.M. tonight.

1003
01:09:58,828 --> 01:10:00,295
No police!

1004
01:10:00,297 --> 01:10:03,565
If you attempt to involve
the police we'll know.

1005
01:10:03,567 --> 01:10:04,933
Lord's daughter will die

1006
01:10:04,935 --> 01:10:08,570
and you'll find that out
on the Six O'Clock News.

1007
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:10,171
Jessica's father is dead.

1008
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:11,673
Who the fuck is Lord?

1009
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:14,309
John Lord is a New York City Councilman.

1010
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:17,946
He is Jessica's real father
and he is very much alive.

1011
01:10:17,948 --> 01:10:20,615
He's the guy who hired me.

1012
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:22,383
Jessica said you had
something on Yates,

1013
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:23,685
got our loan forgiven.

1014
01:10:23,687 --> 01:10:25,220
Is that why this is happening?

1015
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:29,757
No. I covered your marker
with my own money.

1016
01:10:29,759 --> 01:10:32,727
Yates must have found out whose
kid she was some other way,

1017
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,629
maybe someone on the
department, I don't know.

1018
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:35,763
You've got to get that
money from Lord.

1019
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:37,799
That's not going to happen.

1020
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:39,968
Lord's lost it.

1021
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:41,769
Even if you wanted to pay the ransom,

1022
01:10:41,771 --> 01:10:46,708
he'd just bring every cop
in the city and fuck it up.

1023
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:49,210
I've got about 170,000 in loose cash.

1024
01:10:49,212 --> 01:10:51,412
I can break into the real estate
office and steal the safe.

1025
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:52,714
I don't know how much is in there but..

1026
01:10:52,716 --> 01:10:55,483
No, it's not going to work.
It's not a bank.

1027
01:10:55,485 --> 01:10:58,586
They don't keep that
kind of cash around.

1028
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,323
You know, I've got somebody
we can talk to about this.

1029
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:16,831
Hey Jimmy!

1030
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:20,034
You've grown.

1031
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:23,705
I thought you'd be dead by now.

1032
01:12:23,707 --> 01:12:24,739
Not yet.

1033
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:27,375
How's your aunt doing?

1034
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:29,110
I'm not happy to see you, Bill.

1035
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:57,438
Who do we have here?

1036
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,773
Hey Liz!

1037
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:01,042
You've got some nice friends out there.

1038
01:13:01,044 --> 01:13:03,578
Hey handsome!

1039
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,482
Come a little closer.

1040
01:13:10,619 --> 01:13:16,791
Bill, you got old, Bill.

1041
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:19,560
Yeah, we all did.

1042
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:22,730
What happened to that
handsome face of yours?

1043
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:24,966
You sleep with the
garbage man's wife again?

1044
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:27,802
Yeah.

1045
01:13:27,804 --> 01:13:30,004
It's good to see you, Liz.

1046
01:13:31,775 --> 01:13:35,376
How sweet of you
to visit me on my birthday.

1047
01:13:35,378 --> 01:13:38,379
It's not a birthday without a surprise.

1048
01:13:38,381 --> 01:13:40,148
I miss you, Bill.

1049
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:42,083
I've been thinking
about you lately.

1050
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:44,519
I'm not really here to talk
to you about that today, Liz.

1051
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:50,391
I'm in kind of a time-sensitive situation

1052
01:13:50,393 --> 01:13:53,394
I could use your help with.

1053
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:56,130
Well, that's fascinating, Bill.

1054
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:00,668
Ah!

1055
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:17,051
You know, the Interborough
case wasn't kind to you, Liz.

1056
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:24,659
I wasn't kind to you either.

1057
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:28,596
Yeah, well, I did what I had to do.

1058
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:33,534
You seemed to be doing all
right, business-wise anyway.

1059
01:14:33,536 --> 01:14:35,570
How's your wife, Bill?

1060
01:14:35,572 --> 01:14:38,539
I haven't talked to her in two years.

1061
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:40,107
You really want to have
this conversation now?

1062
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:43,544
No, not really.

1063
01:14:43,546 --> 01:14:45,680
And you came to see me, remember?

1064
01:14:45,682 --> 01:14:48,883
And as you can see, it's my birthday,

1065
01:14:48,885 --> 01:14:52,453
so I'm not really in the
mood for a fucking argument.

1066
01:14:52,455 --> 01:14:54,856
Fine. Fuck!

1067
01:14:56,625 --> 01:14:57,825
Just like old times.

1068
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,529
I've got a friend in trouble, Liz.

1069
01:15:01,531 --> 01:15:06,701
Hmm, how much Bill?

1070
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:08,936
75 grand.

1071
01:15:08,938 --> 01:15:11,806
As a businessman, I can't be
giving out that kind of money.

1072
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:14,842
It's a personal matter.

1073
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:18,012
Yeah, not to me, isn't it?

1074
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:21,082
Look, I know you don't
think much of me.

1075
01:15:21,084 --> 01:15:23,651
Maybe you don't
have much reason to.

1076
01:15:23,653 --> 01:15:28,689
I am genuinely sorry for
what happened between us.

1077
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:31,792
But fuck, Liz have you
looked at yourself lately?

1078
01:15:31,794 --> 01:15:36,631
Is that seriously your sales pitch?

1079
01:15:36,633 --> 01:15:39,200
I know you don't got long to go, Liz.

1080
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:41,168
but you're not the only one.

1081
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:49,577
Jesus Christ, don't fucking
apologize to me, Liz!

1082
01:15:49,579 --> 01:15:53,681
This girl's got a legitimate
shot and a regular life,

1083
01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:57,051
I know there's a fucking human
being in there somewhere, Liz.

1084
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,620
I'm asking you to do this for us

1085
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,157
and both of us.

1086
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:06,961
What have you got for collateral?

1087
01:16:06,963 --> 01:16:08,229
Nothing.

1088
01:16:11,034 --> 01:16:14,135
And I need you to get
me in to see Yates today.

1089
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:28,849
Let's go!

1090
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,087
You've got two minutes with the man.

1091
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,122
Just stand seven feet
back, you don't sit down,

1092
01:16:35,124 --> 01:16:36,924
you don't shake hands

1093
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,159
and you're done, when
he says you're done.

1094
01:16:38,161 --> 01:16:39,226
Got it?

1095
01:16:39,228 --> 01:16:40,928
Got it!

1096
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,697
After you!

1097
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:48,836
Detective!

1098
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:50,838
You look like shit.

1099
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,573
What can I do for you today?

1100
01:16:52,575 --> 01:16:54,842
Mr. Yates, I brought your money.

1101
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:56,243
If It's all the same to you,
I'd like to dispense

1102
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:58,312
with the whole open-field
showdown thing

1103
01:16:58,314 --> 01:16:59,947
and just walk out of
here with the girl now.

1104
01:16:59,949 --> 01:17:01,682
Which girl exactly did you think

1105
01:17:01,684 --> 01:17:04,118
you were going to
walk out of here with?

1106
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,686
Jessica.

1107
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:07,355
Jessica?

1108
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:13,995
I don't seek to have any
Jessica's with me today.

1109
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:15,863
I have Tanya.

1110
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:21,035
I brought your money, let's get to it.

1111
01:17:21,037 --> 01:17:23,304
Does this guy owe us money?

1112
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:25,373
You've got the wrong house, pal.

1113
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:28,876
Hold on! You've got a couple
of goons that work for you,

1114
01:17:28,878 --> 01:17:30,711
one of them has got a woman's name?

1115
01:17:30,713 --> 01:17:33,381
Yeah, they don't work for me anymore.

1116
01:17:33,383 --> 01:17:35,850
Does a kid named Duane,
have a marker with you?

1117
01:17:35,852 --> 01:17:36,984
Are you still a cop?

1118
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:38,386
I am a convicted felon.

1119
01:17:38,388 --> 01:17:41,856
All right, look, this guy
comes in here what --

1120
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:43,691
a couple of weeks ago, right?

1121
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:45,092
And he buys the marker from me.

1122
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:46,661
I don't know his name.

1123
01:17:46,663 --> 01:17:47,828
I don't know where he went.

1124
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,364
I don't know how to reach him, okay?

1125
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:54,101
Now, if you don't mind,

1126
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:59,140
I would like for you
to get the fuck out.

1127
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:02,309
You can leave the
money if you want.

1128
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:04,311
Fuck you!

1129
01:18:18,795 --> 01:18:23,130
you think you'll always
get another chance.

1130
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:27,001
Flunk out of school,
try again next year.

1131
01:18:27,003 --> 01:18:29,070
Short of cash?

1132
01:18:29,072 --> 01:18:31,372
Charge it.

1133
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:35,376
And then, one day
you wake up and realize

1134
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:39,980
no rich friend can
bail you out of this one.

1135
01:18:39,982 --> 01:18:44,351
You've been charging
it your whole life.

1136
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:47,121
Predicated every rotten
fucking thing you ever did

1137
01:18:47,123 --> 01:18:50,791
on some future act of goodness.

1138
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:53,027
With the exchange I want
you inside the car.

1139
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:54,395
Don't get out.

1140
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:56,430
Keep the engine running.

1141
01:18:56,432 --> 01:19:02,436
Nothing is going to go wrong as
long as you stay inside the car.

1142
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:04,038
You're going to want
to get out and meet her,

1143
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,906
I'm telling you don't.

1144
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:09,477
Stay in the car.

1145
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:11,946
Let her come to you.

1146
01:19:18,755 --> 01:19:20,454
Are you okay?

1147
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,329
As soon as she is back in the car

1148
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:31,398
you drive out of here
as fast as you can.

1149
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,201
What about you?

1150
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:36,270
Stay in the car.

1151
01:19:53,856 --> 01:19:57,057
One day I woke up
a stiff, slow old man.

1152
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:07,334
Now I'm just sitting here
day-after-day getting old.

1153
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:17,478
And the older I get,
the faster life goes by.

1154
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:25,419
No matter what I try
to do to slow it down,

1155
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:31,192
it just keeps going faster.

1156
01:20:31,194 --> 01:20:34,295
I'm closer now to the
end than the beginning,

1157
01:20:34,297 --> 01:20:36,230
and nobody's here but me.

1158
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,369
What have I done?

1159
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:22,343
You're driving for these guys too?

1160
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,091
Jessica!

1161
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:41,095
No! No! No!

1162
01:21:58,546 --> 01:22:03,150
You color outside the lines,
sometimes it works out,

1163
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:05,519
sometimes you get fucked.

1164
01:22:05,521 --> 01:22:07,354
He is coming with us.

1165
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:08,656
Sit up, man!

1166
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:22,169
Come on! Let's go!

1167
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:27,908
Jesus Christ! Will you
have some fucking pride.

1168
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:30,411
Get these people in
the goddamn car ready.

1169
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:16,210
Did I do anything?

1170
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:20,447
Anything anyone will remember?

1171
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:25,853
Anything good?
