1
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,208
<i>In the 20th century,</i>

2
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,777
<i>if you wanted
to know your neighbors,</i>

3
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,578
<i>you moved to the suburbs.</i>

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,647
<i>If you wanted
to become an addict,</i>

5
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,516
<i>you moved to New York.</i>

6
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,787
<i>The junkies are in the burbs,</i>

7
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:58,624
<i>and the building next door
is a fucking kickball league.</i>

8
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:02,594
<i>It was art against commerce,
and commerce won.</i>

9
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:05,764
<i>The kids think the only place
to find art is in a gallery</i>

10
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:07,533
<i>and the only place
to find romance</i>

11
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:10,269
<i>is confessing your love
in the rain,</i>

12
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:11,737
<i>like in the movies.</i>

13
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,739
<i>But it's messier than that.</i>

14
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:17,476
<i>Well, there's always mess.</i>

15
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:21,146
<i>It's safe here now,
but there's still urban decay.</i>

16
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:23,749
<i>It's just migrated
into the dinner parties</i>

17
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,218
<i>of the upper West Side.</i>

18
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,487
<i>The best lack all conviction,</i>

19
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:32,257
<i>while the worst are filled
with passionate intensity.</i>

20
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,127
<i>Yeats said that,
but so did Lou Reed,</i>

21
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:38,664
<i>quoting him live
at the bottom line.</i>

22
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:42,468
<i>Lou Reed's gone,
and so is the bottom line.</i>

23
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,170
<i>It's probably a soulcycle...</i>

24
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,874
<i>the only soul
the city has left.</i>

25
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:51,777
<i>Everyone's pretending
it's all okay,</i>

26
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,745
<i>but that's a lie.</i>

27
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:56,482
<i>Something's missing,
and we all feel it.</i>

28
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:59,351
<i>Including Thomas webb.</i>

29
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:03,288
<i>He thought he had the answer
and her name was Mimi.</i>

30
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:10,229
1976. The city was
dirty, crime-ridden and broke.

31
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:13,298
It was the center
of the creative universe.

32
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,200
New York's lost its soul.

33
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:18,337
The most vibrant neighborhood
at the moment is Philadelphia.

34
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,840
I like that.

35
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,242
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,610
Where'd you lift that from?

37
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,345
I didn't. It's mine.

38
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:28,547
Well, it's good.

39
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:32,217
So, will you come
with me tonight?

40
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:35,587
No. Your mom's last dinner
party made me feel invisible.

41
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:38,157
I know, but we were
invisible together.

42
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,526
If you don't like it,
then you don't go.

43
00:02:40,528 --> 00:02:42,728
I have to go.
My mother's unstable.

44
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,763
Throwing dinner parties
is how she medicates.

45
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,832
Yeah, so what about
the lithium and Xanax?

46
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,536
Not to mention
the nicotine and shiraz.

47
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:52,471
Semantics.

48
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,276
I have to tell you something.

49
00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:59,211
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,647
I...

51
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:05,617
Might be going to zagreb.

52
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,853
- Where?
- Zagreb.

53
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,755
It's in Croatia.

54
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:12,758
So, Helmut graph,
he runs a workshop there,

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,295
and I found out that I can
transfer my credits to nyu.

56
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,897
That's, um...

57
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,600
That's...

58
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,635
Terrible.

59
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:26,572
Why?

60
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,674
No, why is that terrible?

61
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,976
Because you're the only thing
in my life that I'm settled on.

62
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,412
Thomas, what do you think
is happening?

63
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,647
Between me and you,
what do you think this is?

64
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,717
August 8. August 8.
I think August 8 was real.

65
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,819
It was amazing.

66
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:43,355
But it was just one night.

67
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,757
I mean, Nick was playing L.A.

68
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,426
I was vulnerable.

69
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:49,861
We were both on Molly.

70
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,730
I- i thought I was a pirate.

71
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,970
And it was just one night.

72
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:00,706
Well, I'm crazy about you.

73
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,442
- I'm crazy about you, but...
- But don't say "as friends."

74
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:05,978
Why? Why is that so bad?

75
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,779
Because pretty girls like
to recruit their rejections

76
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:08,947
and then call them friends.

77
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,019
Wow.

78
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:42,714
<i>For Mimi, Thomas was like
the new New York...</i>

79
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,584
<i>no danger, no deliverance.</i>

80
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,352
<i>It made him nurturing</i>

81
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:50,656
<i>and too boring
to fall in love with.</i>

82
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:54,326
<i>Mimi thought Thomas
was a boy without mystery.</i>

83
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,961
<i>Thomas agreed.</i>

84
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,964
<i>But all that
was about to change.</i>

85
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,489
Anything worth opening?

86
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,493
Just bills and junk.

87
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,031
W.F.

88
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,833
W.F. Gerald.

89
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,703
I just moved into 2-b.

90
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,539
Thomas webb.

91
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,774
Why so troubled, Thomas?

92
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,042
Excuse me?

93
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,611
I know that color of stress.

94
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,513
It's much brighter
than job issues,

95
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,117
more subdued
than possible disease.

96
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,485
Ah.

97
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,487
Sorry, I'm being rude.

98
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,056
No, I mean...

99
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,725
I'm having a bad day.

100
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:01,593
Oh.

101
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,595
What's her name?

102
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,033
It's Mimi.

103
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,468
Ah, Mimi.

104
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,403
Derived from williamina.

105
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,638
It means "resolute protector."

106
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,842
There you go.

107
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,644
What, uh...

108
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,980
What is it that you like
about this Mimi?

109
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,416
You a psychiatrist?

110
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:25,817
No.

111
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,719
You ask psychiatrist questions.

112
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,488
Maybe I can help.

113
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,758
Maybe I can help you
get Mimi to sleep with you.

114
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,095
How do you know
she hasn't already?

115
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,610
It's nice meeting you.

116
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:54,112
Yeah.

117
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:59,484
Well, why don't you let a new
neighbor help you out, hmm?

118
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,188
What do you like about Mimi?

119
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,727
I'm in 2-b!

120
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,728
<i>Where did you meet her?</i>

121
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:47,933
There's this bookstore
called the pale fire.

122
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,801
- Yeah.
- It's named after John sh...

123
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,171
John shade's 999-line poem.

124
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,507
Nabokov.

125
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,510
Right. Well... they sell
rare vintage books in there,

126
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,645
and I'm into that, just
reading off the beaten path,

127
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,514
and Mimi works there.

128
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:05,083
She gave me
the greatest recommendations.

129
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,952
You know?

130
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,954
She's putting herself
through nyu's writing program.

131
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,755
She reads a book a week.
She's...

132
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,757
Polishing her brain.

133
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,259
Huh.

134
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,962
Beautiful?

135
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,731
Incredibly beautiful.

136
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,534
- Like she's direct from god,
you know? -Mm.

137
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:24,503
Not second generation,
if that makes sense.

138
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:26,805
Complete sense.

139
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:30,275
You know, we get each other.

140
00:08:30,277 --> 00:08:33,612
Problem was...

141
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:37,616
is... that she has
this boyfriend.

142
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:41,553
Nick, and he's in that band,
fahrenheit 185.

143
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,556
The exact temperature it takes
to cook heroin.

144
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,793
Properly.

145
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,032
Eh, let's see what we got.

146
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,940
Yeah.

147
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,679
Anyway, so, Nick goes on tour.

148
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:11,683
Mimi's now available, and
we're hanging out more, and...

149
00:09:11,685 --> 00:09:14,019
We end up spending...

150
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,954
A magical night together.

151
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,924
- Mm.
- August 8.

152
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:22,894
And then... nothing.

153
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,063
All goes platonic.

154
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,666
How old is Mimi?

155
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,602
She's... 22.
She just turned 22.

156
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,837
She's young, you know?

157
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,842
She's at an age where defense
mechanisms are very strong.

158
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:41,346
Despite her outer veneer,
she's ruled by fear.

159
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:44,649
Like so many of us
at that time, you know.

160
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,585
What you need to do,

161
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,821
mm, just make her afraid
of something more

162
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,691
than being with you
in that way.

163
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:55,794
Which is?

164
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,730
Mm, not being with you.

165
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,232
But how?

166
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,134
How am I supposed to do that?

167
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,671
Mm... let life take over.

168
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,344
Uh, find a window, then pounce.

169
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,380
That's it?

170
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,782
That's your Sage
neighborly advice?

171
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,784
Can I have my money back?

172
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,686
Thomas...

173
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,655
- Is it Thomas or tom?
- It's Thomas.

174
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,823
Not Tommy?

175
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,826
- No, never, never.
- No? Ah, Thomas.

176
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,694
You're not giving life
enough credit.

177
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,196
The unpredictable forces
of humanity.

178
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:33,732
- My life is not unpredictable.
- Life is as much a dream

179
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:35,266
- as it is a nightmare.
- My life is conventional.

180
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,801
- My life is boring.
- No.

181
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:41,006
It's as random
as it is deliberate.

182
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:46,177
You know, as funny
as it is tragic.

183
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,046
Yours is no exception.

184
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,015
I got to piss.

185
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:59,658
<i>Dinner parties were
Judith's safety blanket.</i>

186
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,394
<i>A tableful of artists
took her mind off herself.</i>

187
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:05,664
<i>The swirl of distraction,
seating plans,</i>

188
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,232
<i>gossip, food...</i>

189
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,934
<i>anything
to keep away the dread.</i>

190
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:13,038
<i>They were the perfect antidote
to her childhood dinners.</i>

191
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,907
<i>The silences,
the drunken outbursts.</i>

192
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,876
<i>Artists came to New York
from all over,</i>

193
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:20,879
<i>and she always took them in,
clinging to the illusion</i>

194
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,348
<i>of an open, happy family.</i>

195
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,250
Do you miss getting mugged
on central park west

196
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,818
- while walking your dog?
- Exactly. Exactly.

197
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,255
No, but I do miss
the 2nd Avenue deli.

198
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:32,057
- Uh-huh.
- I miss the lenox lounge.

199
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,460
I mean, do you know what are
in those iconic places now?

200
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:36,695
Urban outfitters,

201
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,229
- a Starbucks...
- Star...

202
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,832
There's a John Varvatos
where cbgb's used to be.

203
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:44,035
New York's lost its soul.

204
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,705
What was that, Thomas?

205
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,873
Well, I was just agreeing
with David

206
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,009
that New York
has lost its soul.

207
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,178
Ever since he returned
from three months in Peru,

208
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,946
he's decided to hate
where he's from.

209
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,481
No, it's true.

210
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:58,216
New York's most vibrant
neighborhood at the moment

211
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,284
is Philadelphia.

212
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:04,322
That's very funny, Thomas.

213
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:07,492
So, uh, Ethan, I heard that
you've commissioned Nick bilton

214
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,260
to write the biography
on Evan douriff.

215
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,429
Our mandate at kenta
is very simple...

216
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,331
BIOS on any haircut under 40

217
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,834
as long as they're still
within their 15 minutes.

218
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,936
Self-help, political rants.

219
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,437
Nobody reads fiction anymore.

220
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:21,139
And once a writer.

221
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,242
- So cynical, Ethan webb.
- -I know. -

222
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,011
if I were a writer, we'd be
having this conversation

223
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,880
in a two-bedroom in bushwick.

224
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,515
Oh, that's true.
- Bushwick is expensive now.

225
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,083
Yeah, exactly.

226
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,351
I'm serious.
I'm really serious.

227
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,386
I mean,
most novelists these days,

228
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:38,022
they don't earn enough money
to support themselves.

229
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,191
- True. -No matter
how talented they are.

230
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:43,394
That's why if Thomas came to me
with a desire to be a writer,

231
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,964
well... I'd talk him out of it.

232
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,368
So, you're still
tutoring, right?

233
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,237
Yeah. Just for some extra cash.

234
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,305
- He could be a Spanish teacher.
- Yes, he could.

235
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,241
I don't know if I could be
a Spanish teacher.

236
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,209
If he went back to college
for a year.

237
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,545
For some reason,
he refuses to do it.

238
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,281
He lives on the lower east side
without any direction.

239
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,483
The only thing missing
is an opium habit.

240
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,919
What about
doing a smartphone application?

241
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,962
This man moved in
across the hall from me.

242
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,398
I don't know what he does
or who he is, but...

243
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,133
He seems familiar to me.

244
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,501
He's my new friend.

245
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,937
- Aw.
- Yeah.

246
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:00,438
- He asked about you.
- Me?

247
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,973
- Mm-hmm.
- He knows me?

248
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,083
What's my father doing here?

249
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,155
Who's he with?

250
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:20,191
I don't know.

251
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,995
She's beautiful.

252
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,058
<i>Do you have any idea</i>

253
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,395
what this is gonna do
to my mother?

254
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,531
This doesn't mean
your father loves you any less.

255
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:06,404
- Sorry. That was bad.
- That was.

256
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,107
I know, like dispensing therapy
from an after-school special.

257
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:12,944
He doesn't care about me
to begin with, I know that.

258
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:15,079
This...

259
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,081
This is about my mother.

260
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,250
Yeah, but...
It's their problem.

261
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,652
You have your own problems.

262
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,387
Like what?

263
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,022
- Uh...
- Actually, don't.

264
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,424
Don't answer that. Not now.

265
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:30,028
Thomas.

266
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,562
Look at me.

267
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:35,300
Look, your parents,

268
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:39,470
their world
is nothing like ours.

269
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:45,443
I mean, maybe
it's their generation or...

270
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,979
I don't know... this island.

271
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,517
But you're kind.

272
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,386
And you're real.

273
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,971
Don't do that.

274
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,714
I mean, look, you're young,

275
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:24,716
and your defense mechanisms
are strong.

276
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:26,417
But I think that you want this.

277
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,019
- I really do.
- I think...

278
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,554
I think that you're confused
right now.

279
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:32,190
No, Mimi, I'm angry right now.

280
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,192
I'm angry.

281
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,661
Did you see that woman? Did
you see how beautiful she was?

282
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,631
I could never get a woman
like that.

283
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,400
But my father,
with his publishing house

284
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:45,536
and his-his good looks
and his-his cheating...

285
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,739
- Fucking hair.
- Wow.

286
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:50,575
So, what, you're gonna use
your father's affair

287
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:54,045
as a confirmation
of your own inadequacies?

288
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,449
No, Mimi.

289
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,653
I have you for that.

290
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:09,160
So, you call my office,
you say you want to have lunch.

291
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,262
You never want to have lunch.

292
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,264
I figured you had
a big surprise.

293
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:15,099
Maybe you've figured out
your life.

294
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:17,235
No. Definitely haven't
figured out my life.

295
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,737
- Mm. Bruce. -I wanted
to speak to you about...

296
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,506
- Thank you for the tickets.
- Good-good to see you.

297
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,408
- Well, of course. Any time.
- Oh, she enjoyed the show.

298
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,043
- Judith. Very much. -It was...
It was good, wasn't it?

299
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:26,611
- Yeah, it was great.
- Great. Say hi to Judith.

300
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,646
I will, indeed. All right.

301
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:32,316
I want you to move
from the lower east side.

302
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:35,319
Why do you insist on living
in the farthest corner

303
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,221
of Manhattan away from us?

304
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,490
I think it's intentional.

305
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:43,194
I think it's almost... hurtful.

306
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:46,097
Look...

307
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,799
I'm not asking for me.

308
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:50,334
I'm asking for your mother.

309
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:52,336
She wants you closer to home.

310
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,505
How is mom?

311
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,843
Better.

312
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:00,778
I guess.

313
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,782
Can't get her to quit smoking.

314
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,350
Well, she's fragile.

315
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,820
Anything, even
the smallest thing, could...

316
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:12,457
Create another... incident.

317
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,365
I'll pay the difference
in rent.

318
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,367
Hmm?

319
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,472
Will you think about it?

320
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,607
- Dad...
- Also, I set up an appointment

321
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,209
with a career counselor
for you.

322
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,244
My office will e-mail you
the info.

323
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:35,880
Dad, I know you're...
I- i know...

324
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,882
You know I'm what, Thomas?

325
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,386
I know you're just
trying to help.

326
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,155
Don't blow it off, okay?

327
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,691
- I had to call in a favor
for her to see you. -All right.

328
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:50,228
She actually has
a waiting list.

329
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,630
<i>Are you gonna confront
your father?</i>

330
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,533
No. Trouble talking to him.

331
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57,768
Why?

332
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,339
I don't think
he likes me that much.

333
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:04,342
What, uh...

334
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,778
What exactly is wrong
with your mother?

335
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,715
I don't know.
She's depressed, bipolar.

336
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:13,818
She's a depressive bipolar.

337
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,288
She came from
a broken home, so...

338
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,390
Whenever anything threatens
our perfect family,

339
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:22,426
she completely unravels.

340
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,298
I can't tell her.
She'll be destroyed.

341
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,370
Why don't you furnish
this place, hmm?

342
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,505
I live in Brooklyn.

343
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,409
You have two apartments?

344
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,411
I'm rich.

345
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,580
I'm a fucking Duke.

346
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,358
Or maybe he's...
Been faithful all these years.

347
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,294
Maybe she came on to him.
I've seen her.

348
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,763
- She's irresistible. I mean...
- Uh, stop.

349
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,533
What do you want?

350
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,535
- I want my father to stop
seeing this woman. -No, no, no.

351
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,605
No, in life.

352
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,741
In your life.

353
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,343
You want more money?

354
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,545
You want more respect?

355
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,514
You know?

356
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:19,383
What is it that you want?

357
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,385
Think about it.

358
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,455
Really think about it.

359
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,457
I want to be better.

360
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,259
- Better?
- Mm.

361
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,228
Than what?

362
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,669
Than them.

363
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,539
<i>In the '80s,
Ethan was intoxicated</i>

364
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,008
<i>by literary New York.</i>

365
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,277
<i>But when he accepted
that he lacked the talent</i>

366
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,878
<i>to create a fictional family,</i>

367
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,948
<i>he thought at least
he could create a real one.</i>

368
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,417
<i>Young Thomas loved to write.</i>

369
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,286
<i>Ethan ignored this,</i>

370
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:59,423
<i>wary of nurturing a life
of rejections and evictions,</i>

371
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,827
<i>and Thomas learned to keep
his stories to himself.</i>

372
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,496
<i>The intensity of Judith's bond
with her son</i>

373
00:21:05,498 --> 00:21:09,467
<i>left Ethan feeling like
a stranger in his own home.</i>

374
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,602
<i>He sought refuge in work,</i>

375
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,039
<i>until publishing began
its slow decline.</i>

376
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,276
<i>Then... came Johanna.</i>

377
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,612
You know, private detectives
get paid by the hour.

378
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,781
To just-just wait.

379
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,783
To do exactly what we're doing
right now.

380
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,519
I mean, what is the difficulty
in a stakeout?

381
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,423
I really got to go to class.

382
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,791
No, just wait, all right?

383
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,927
He'll be out in a minute.

384
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,864
I have to see
if he's gonna meet her again.

385
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:42,466
Please, just wait.

386
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,771
Okay.

387
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,977
Oh, my god, that's her.

388
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,979
The other woman.

389
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:57,948
I'll call you later.

390
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,750
Wait, are we waiting
for your dad?

391
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,719
I'll call you later.

392
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:47,725
<i>What is it, exactly,
that you want to accomplish?</i>

393
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:50,060
I want to meet her.

394
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,163
And tell her
to stop seeing my father.

395
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:54,031
She could kill my mother.

396
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,033
Well, so do it.

397
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,704
I haven't built up
the courage yet.

398
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,640
Mm.

399
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,708
So you stalk her, huh?

400
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,911
I shouldn't be dealing
with this at all.

401
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:09,447
I should be on a beach...

402
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,982
With Mimi...

403
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:14,852
Naked...

404
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:18,456
In Croatia.

405
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,057
We should be together together.

406
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,759
"Should" is a dangerous word.

407
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,094
I'm serious, man.

408
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,464
If it wasn't for my mother,
i wouldn't be here.

409
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,036
I don't buy it.

410
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,072
You don't buy what?

411
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:39,477
I don't buy that this is just
about your mother's health.

412
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,679
You want something more here.

413
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:44,482
Something more what?

414
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,717
Provocative.

415
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,565
Excuse me.

416
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,634
- Excuse me.
- -Yes.

417
00:25:03,636 --> 00:25:05,503
Y- you don't know who I am.

418
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,171
Yes, I do.

419
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,706
You do?

420
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,107
You're the boy who follows me.

421
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:11,842
Yeah, well,
i have a good reason.

422
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,845
You're also Ethan's son.

423
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,248
He keeps a picture of you
on his desk.

424
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,118
Are you hungry, Thomas?

425
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:34,798
Following someone in this city
has got to be very difficult.

426
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,101
It's so easy
to be anonymous here.

427
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:39,670
Why didn't you say anything
when I was following you?

428
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,205
Why didn't you say anything?

429
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,574
Because I didn't know
what I was gonna do.

430
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,543
- And do you now?
- Yes.

431
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:47,978
Is it good?

432
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,685
- Johanna.
- Johanna?

433
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,153
Yeah, I'm Johanna.

434
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,722
Okay, Johanna, how long
you been fucking my father?

435
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,158
Is that kind of vulgarity
entirely necessary here?

436
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,260
What kind of vulgarity
would you prefer?

437
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,898
A little bit over a year.

438
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,167
Why are you even seeing him?
He's married.

439
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:12,703
He is married.

440
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:17,141
- Do you work with him?
- Sometimes.

441
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:21,879
I'm a freelance editor,
so I work for all the houses.

442
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,983
Do you love him?

443
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:28,586
Define love, Thomas.

444
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,721
Do you think
that you're gonna marry him?

445
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:33,190
Is that the plan? You think
you're gonna steal him away

446
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,925
from my mother?

447
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,328
How do you know your mother
isn't giving him to me?

448
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,997
What's that supposed to mean?

449
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:43,734
I mean that people do things
all the time without realizing.

450
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:46,203
Your mother may be giving me
Ethan without comprehending it.

451
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:52,276
I mean, you're doing something
right now without realizing it.

452
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,278
Yeah? And what am I doing?

453
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,213
You're trying
to make love to me.

454
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,282
I'm trying to make love to you?

455
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,884
I'm trying
to make love to you?

456
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,389
You just don't realize it.

457
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,893
Andy warhol was
a close, personal friend,

458
00:27:09,895 --> 00:27:12,730
and he gave us that piece
as a gift.

459
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:16,300
And now this goddamn committee
is going to take all that away.

460
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,901
Mom, it doesn't really matter.

461
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,903
These people,
these non-entities in Chelsea,

462
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,271
they're trying
to steal my past.

463
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,374
- They're trying to
erase my memories. -Mom.

464
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,144
We're gonna find the photo.

465
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,282
Look at this mess.

466
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,184
I need a cigarette.

467
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,888
But your father has declared

468
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,290
I'm no longer allowed
to smoke in the house, so...

469
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:43,293
All right, well, I'll
stay here and keep searching.

470
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:50,801
Thomas, I want to smoke and
talk to you at the same time.

471
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,671
- It makes the cigarette better.
- Okay.

472
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:55,939
Thank you.

473
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,210
It's just this perpetual cycle

474
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:03,080
of expectations
and disappointments.

475
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,417
You know?

476
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:09,319
The farthest distance
in the world

477
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:13,957
is between how it is and how
you thought it was gonna be.

478
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,960
Don't forget that.

479
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:18,962
I won't.

480
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:24,435
You're my light, Thomas.

481
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:26,804
You know?

482
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:29,973
I don't know what I'd do
without you.

483
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,112
It's this klonopin.

484
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:37,781
- Makes me so fucking emotional.
- You're fine.

485
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:46,724
I want you
to stop seeing my father.

486
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:48,125
Oh, hello, Thomas.

487
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,727
Look, you're
a very beautiful woman.

488
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,729
You can get any man
you want in this city.

489
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:53,363
Could I get you?

490
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,199
What?

491
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,735
You said I can get any man
in this city.

492
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:01,105
So I'm asking, could I get you?

493
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:03,407
Which actually begs
another question, really.

494
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,142
Are you a man?

495
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:06,877
My mother's in a fragile state.

496
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:08,779
This affair could put her
over the top.

497
00:29:08,781 --> 00:29:10,481
- How am I responsible for your mother?
- Because you're fucking

498
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:12,182
- my father. -Okay, we know
that crudeness doesn't

499
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,517
- make one a man.
- Stop seeing him.

500
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,785
Nor do demands.

501
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,086
I'm not trying to be a man.

502
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,488
I'm not trying
to make love to you.

503
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,290
I'm trying to save my mother.

504
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,292
You're getting closer.

505
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,770
<i>Johanna wasn't raised
by writers.</i>

506
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:35,472
<i>She was raised by bankers.</i>

507
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:38,876
<i>But the lingua franca of both
is fiction.</i>

508
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,545
<i>When Ethan floated the idea
of leaving his wife,</i>

509
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:44,548
<i>she assumed it was just talk.</i>

510
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:50,387
<i>But to her surprise,
his suggestion unbalanced her.</i>

511
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:55,225
<i>Instead of feeling flattered,
she felt suddenly needy.</i>

512
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:58,061
<i>Thomas's attention
was the perfect remedy</i>

513
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:00,831
<i>to her rattled confidence.</i>

514
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,834
Those visions of Johanna.

515
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:07,938
She's not like anyone
I've ever met.

516
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,841
She said I was trying
to make love to her.

517
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:13,544
Oh. Were you?

518
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:16,079
No, I want her to stop
seeing my father.

519
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,117
Isn't that between
you and your father?

520
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:24,388
Why-why would you
want to make contact with her?

521
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,225
She's an outsider to what seems
to me to be a family issue.

522
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:30,227
Eat that.

523
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,531
- Uh-huh.
- It's good.

524
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,033
What was it?

525
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:38,235
You don't want to know.

526
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:42,206
So what are you saying, that...
I like dealing with her?

527
00:30:42,208 --> 00:30:44,241
Uh-huh. That's precisely
what I'm saying.

528
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:46,243
And that I want
to make love to her.

529
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,045
Would you like
to make love to her?

530
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,547
No.

531
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,549
What kind of
a question is that?

532
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,518
- It's sick.
- How is that sick?

533
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,019
It's sick.

534
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,354
She's a beautiful woman.

535
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,389
- So?
- Her name is Johanna.

536
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:02,326
She's sleeping with my father.

537
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:04,261
Would you like to make love
to Johanna?

538
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,230
Will you give me
some credit, please?

539
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:08,632
- This conversation's perverse.
- Just ans-answer the question.

540
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:10,500
- Give me some credit.
- Stop drowning yourself

541
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:12,302
in what you think is moral.

542
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,304
You want to fuck Johanna.

543
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:25,015
Yes. I would.

544
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:27,050
And you said
your life was boring.

545
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:55,279
I couldn't have
handled today without you.

546
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:57,681
You know, I got hit on three
times coming from the bathroom.

547
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:59,483
And I'm pretty sure
they were all married.

548
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,685
Then it's a good thing
my father isn't here.

549
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:03,687
- That's not funny.
- Oh, no.

550
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:05,188
Groom's coming.

551
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,623
It's my ninja.

552
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:09,059
- It's my motherfucking ninja.
- Howard.

553
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,327
- Congratulations, man.
- Thanks, man.

554
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:11,962
Hey, this is Mimi.

555
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:14,097
- Howard. -Nice to meet you.
Listen. -Congrats.

556
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:16,066
I've been running through
riverside park every day,

557
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,068
nine miles,
murdering sobriety.

558
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,704
I've seen a lot of your mother
lately, actually.

559
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:22,472
- My mother?
- Yeah, yeah. I don't know.

560
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,475
She's, uh, always on
the same bench reading a book.

561
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:27,144
That's irwin. Irwin!

562
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:28,645
You guys got to meet
irwin Sanders.

563
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,180
He's buying the Knicks.

564
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:31,315
Howard.
- Hey.

565
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:32,616
How does it feel to be married?

566
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,017
- Well, sex already sucks.
- Ah.

567
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:36,086
Kidding. Kind of.

568
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:38,555
Uh, condé nast
took me back, actually,

569
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:41,058
so, uh, maybe I could get
an interview at some point?

570
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,392
Maybe.

571
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,262
Um, Howard,
this is my friend, Johanna.

572
00:32:45,264 --> 00:32:46,697
- Hi.
- Congratulations.

573
00:32:46,699 --> 00:32:49,066
Nice to meet you.
Thanks. This is Thomas.

574
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,368
- Hi. -Johanna.
- Mimi.

575
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:53,070
Hi.

576
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,514
You're being really obvious.

577
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:25,736
I'm not dating irwin.

578
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:27,237
It's none of your business.

579
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,272
I don't have to
explain myself to you,

580
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,508
but nonetheless...

581
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,510
He's a very good friend.

582
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,481
Where's your girlfriend?

583
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:40,317
She's not.

584
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,519
She's just a friend.

585
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,222
Oh, you shouldn't
let her do that to you.

586
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,396
He's 30 years older than you.

587
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:54,331
He's a billionaire.

588
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:55,599
I'm not stupid.

589
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:58,268
You are quite stupid, Thomas.

590
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,538
And you've got no idea
how the world works.

591
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,340
And, actually, he's not
a billionaire anymore,

592
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:04,708
because Nancy
got half of everything.

593
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,243
Doesn't really matter.

594
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,078
No, it doesn't.

595
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,415
You look nice.

596
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,183
What?

597
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:14,785
You look very nice.

598
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:18,288
In a suit.

599
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,190
I don't really think
you're stupid.

600
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:22,192
Just...

601
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:25,562
Confused and... young.

602
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:30,100
Irwin's probably
looking for you.

603
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:31,768
I'm sure he paid
for the whole night.

604
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,770
Oh, fuck you, really.

605
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,244
Hey.

606
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,346
- So, first of all... hooker comments?
- I know.

607
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:45,082
- I'm sorry. -You actually
resorted to hooker comments?

608
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,516
I'm sorry. I apologize.

609
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:49,719
Okay, second of all,
irwin's gay.

610
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,321
Okay? He loves men.

611
00:34:51,323 --> 00:34:53,090
In fact, he loves
one man in particular,

612
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:54,791
a man named Billy arnaldi,
who happens to be

613
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,594
an incredible art dealer
and one of my closest friends.

614
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,097
So irwin doesn't want to
come out, for business reasons,

615
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,498
which is his prerogative,

616
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,400
and I come to events
like this with him.

617
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:05,435
I'm not a glorified hooker.
He's not a sugar daddy.

618
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,870
I'm his beard.

619
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:09,473
You really don't know
how the world works.

620
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:12,175
You're an innocent, Thomas.
You're a child.

621
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,378
I know some things.

622
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,513
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

623
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:17,681
Like what?

624
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,253
How it went down.

625
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:25,222
You and my dad, I know.

626
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:27,757
- Do you?
- Mm.

627
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:31,461
Okay, Thomas, Mr. Ace sleuth,

628
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,463
I want to hear it.

629
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:40,403
You noticed that
he liked to come in early.

630
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:44,574
Really early, like, what,
7:00 in the morning?

631
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,576
So you started
coming in then, too.

632
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,445
You isolate and contain.

633
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,881
Told him it was because
you don't sleep well,

634
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:53,750
that the bad dreams, they shake
you awake before daylight.

635
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:56,186
In the mornings, you put on
music in your office.

636
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:58,755
Brahms one day, biggie smalls
the next, because, you know,

637
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,925
you can't be put into a box;
You attack all the senses.

638
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:04,728
You went a little aggressive
on your signature scent,

639
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,530
strong on the vanilla.

640
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:09,666
You mentioned a boyfriend,
then complained of a bad date.

641
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,568
You confuse him,
make him wonder.

642
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,837
The sex.

643
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,438
Ooh, the sex.

644
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,607
The sex surprised you both.

645
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,876
He was just walking you home
after dinner.

646
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,878
I mean, Jesus, you're not
the other woman,

647
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,880
he's not a cheating husband.
"No, this isn't something

648
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:27,217
that we did, that is something
that happened to us."

649
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,686
But what? Could it be love?

650
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,321
Well, nobody wants
to acknowledge that

651
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:33,256
so soon in the game,
but the stars are crossed

652
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:35,492
and people
are gonna get hurt and...

653
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,227
"We've done a bad,
bad thing, Ethan,"

654
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:38,895
so, fuck, it must be, right?

655
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:42,899
All of it was just bullshit...
calculated and manipulated...

656
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,668
from that first lie
about your bad dreams.

657
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,538
'Cause I'm-I'm...
I'm pretty sure...

658
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,741
That you sleep like a baby.

659
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,480
You are quite the storytell...

660
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,383
Where have you been?

661
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:35,552
Bathroom. Drank too much.

662
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:42,025
I have to
interrupt now, because, uh...

663
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,760
I have to go home.

664
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:49,366
I'm uncle buster.

665
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,568
- Let's get out of here.
- I'm Casey's father's brother.

666
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,902
They haven't even
cut the cake.

667
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,604
Fuck the cake. Let's go.

668
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,039
What?

669
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,707
- Come on.
- Walter's not here

670
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,809
- because...
- You smell like vanilla.

671
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:02,379
He's doing two to five.

672
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:03,513
It's no secret.

673
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:04,914
As you all know,

674
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:07,884
two to five for doing
the right thing,

675
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:10,787
for believing in the poetry
of the constitution.

676
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,561
I have only a few thoughts.

677
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:21,064
Drama.

678
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:24,501
The dramatics
of marital romance,

679
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:26,503
<i>staying together.</i>

680
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,374
<i>Like the gypsy told me,</i>

681
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,943
<i>the poems
written in life lines</i>

682
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:37,414
<i>are never guaranteed.</i>

683
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:40,417
<i>They get busted up.</i>

684
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:44,054
<i>Tomorrow begins new poetry.</i>

685
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:50,060
<i>Another romance that will
explode from time to time.</i>

686
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:54,831
<i>Poetry of married people
like the Aurora borealis.</i>

687
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:00,704
<i>Strewn like stars in the sky,</i>

688
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:04,974
<i>and the drama
of your lives begins.</i>

689
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:07,510
<i>Chapter after chapter.</i>

690
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,045
<i>Stories.</i>

691
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,647
<i>Books.</i>

692
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:16,419
<i>Revolutions, as I know,
will come.</i>

693
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,821
<i>I've seen many.</i>

694
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:19,989
<i>Lived through them.</i>

695
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,592
<i>They play in
the least expected places,</i>

696
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:24,594
<i>so get ready.</i>

697
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,897
Casey understands Howard.

698
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:31,401
Howard... knows Casey.

699
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:33,370
No.

700
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:35,638
No, not yet.

701
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,640
There's always mystery.

702
00:39:37,642 --> 00:39:39,476
You both know that.

703
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,978
You both know it isn't perfect.

704
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,646
<i>Excitement,</i>

705
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:47,584
<i>trust and struggle,</i>

706
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:52,922
<i>and the unknown privacies
that keep us together.</i>

707
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:54,991
<i>Glue of struggle.</i>

708
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:00,463
<i>I raise my glass.</i>

709
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:04,434
<i>The fragile glass
we stomped on and shattered</i>

710
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:07,704
<i>and will forever
be putting back together,</i>

711
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:12,709
like the puzzles
we first worked as children,

712
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:15,445
learning to be patient,

713
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,881
searching for what fits.

714
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,054
So many puzzles.

715
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:28,024
So many books in this room.

716
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,631
And I talk too much.

717
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,733
Let's dance.

718
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:51,047
<i>So I have to go to this
career counselor.</i>

719
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,049
<i>Uh, my father
set up the appointment.</i>

720
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,553
<i>Why don't you
go into journalism?</i>

721
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:58,721
You ran
the high school newspaper.

722
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,623
No, that doesn't
interest me anymore.

723
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,525
And you won that
advertising prize in college.

724
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,661
- You could do that.
- Uh, how do you know all this

725
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:06,229
about me, huh?
How do you know all this?

726
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:08,765
- I know everything.
Everything about you. -You do?

727
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:11,034
- Okay, um, yearbook committee.
- Uh-huh.

728
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:12,802
- President of the debate club.
- Yeah.

729
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:14,838
Arts editor
of the high school newspaper.

730
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,739
Second single
on the tennis team.

731
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:17,874
Very impressive, Thomas.

732
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:20,210
Huh.

733
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:23,213
Your father has
all your awards on his desk.

734
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:24,747
It's so awful.

735
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:26,483
Oh, that's awkward.

736
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,485
Fuck the career counselor.

737
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:32,889
<i>All right, here's something
you don't know.</i>

738
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,791
That nobody knows.

739
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:36,659
Okay.

740
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,798
I wanted to write.

741
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,567
- Huh.
- Hmm.

742
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:46,936
I used to write all these
things when I was younger.

743
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:49,506
A bunch of letters
from my dog to, like,

744
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:51,608
the mailman and the vet.

745
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,744
And eventually I...

746
00:41:54,746 --> 00:41:57,247
Came up with a collection
of essays called

747
00:41:57,249 --> 00:42:00,116
"Mary Jane vs. Everything."

748
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:02,585
Which I was
incredibly proud of.

749
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:05,555
And, you know,
i show 'em to my dad.

750
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:08,258
What did Ethan say?

751
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,827
"Serviceable."

752
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:12,562
Ouch.

753
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:14,931
Yeah. "Serviceable."

754
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:17,033
That was his exact word.

755
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:20,537
Nothing special,
just serviceable.

756
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,105
He seemed pretty angry
after reading them, though.

757
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:23,540
Well, I want to read them.

758
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:24,807
- You do?
- Yeah.

759
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:25,909
- You can't.
- Why not?

760
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:27,110
'Cause I threw 'em out.

761
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:30,780
Oh, that's so sad.

762
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:33,683
- That's so sad and lonely.
- Mm.

763
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,689
That's good.

764
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:41,157
Really?

765
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:45,061
Yeah. What word
did your father use?

766
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,629
"Serviceable."

767
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,798
I disagree.

768
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,800
I think you've got talent.

769
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:59,275
But your father's a publisher
and I'm just some...

770
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:02,779
Strange neighbor, so you're
gonna go with serviceable, huh?

771
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,251
- Johanna wanted to read 'em.
- Oh, right.

772
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,852
But I don't know if I could...

773
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:12,622
Those visions of Johanna.

774
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:14,857
I think about her...

775
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,662
all the time.

776
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,335
Maybe it's love.

777
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,740
Uh...

778
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:32,375
Love is hard to determine.

779
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,010
Uh, people think
they're in love,

780
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:36,813
and it's something
completely different.

781
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:39,816
You know, infatuation,

782
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:42,051
the righting
of childhood wrongs,

783
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,253
you know, companionship. Um...

784
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,690
Have you ever been in love?

785
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:49,692
Yeah. Once.

786
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,196
Who was she?

787
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:55,064
Oh...

788
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:58,735
She was this woman I knew.

789
00:43:58,737 --> 00:44:02,305
She was taken by someone else,
a dear friend.

790
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:07,243
We had a profound connection,
but she was his girl.

791
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:08,911
It was a mess.

792
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:10,980
So what did you do?

793
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:14,183
Oh, I left
the scene of the crime.

794
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:16,653
You ran away?

795
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:20,390
Uh, well, at the time,
i called it an adventure.

796
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:22,892
But hindsight turned it
into something else,

797
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:25,895
which is what hindsight
inevitably does.

798
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:27,797
Yeah, I ran away.

799
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:29,799
I'm gonna take this.

800
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:31,334
Leave you with your heart on.

801
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,769
With my hard-on?

802
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:35,438
Heart. Your heart on.

803
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,907
You know what, maybe,
in hindsight,

804
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:40,410
I'll feel guilty about Johanna,
but right now I don't.

805
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,815
It's not cut or dry.

806
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:49,052
Congratulations, Thomas.

807
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:51,721
Your world is
becoming contextual.

808
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,861
Who the fuck are you?

809
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,841
Hey, dad.

810
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:13,843
What's up?

811
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,978
Sit down.

812
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,951
Is everything all right?

813
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:23,820
Is mom okay?

814
00:45:23,822 --> 00:45:26,089
Sit down, Thomas.

815
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,771
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

816
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,209
No.

817
00:45:46,211 --> 00:45:48,444
No, nothing.

818
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:51,447
Mm-hmm. Anything I should know?

819
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,185
No.

820
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,190
Thomas...

821
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:04,093
You blew off
the career counselor.

822
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,528
Hmm?

823
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,064
I told you how hard it was
to get that appointment,

824
00:46:08,066 --> 00:46:09,866
and then you just
don't show up?

825
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:11,200
- Whoosh. Gone.
- Right.

826
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:13,469
Um, um...

827
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:15,371
I should've called.

828
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:16,539
- Mm-hmm, you should've called.
- I'm sorry.

829
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:19,075
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too.

830
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:24,147
Come work here.

831
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:26,015
Hmm? Work here.

832
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,950
You like to read.

833
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,819
I've been conflicted
about giving you a job here...

834
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:32,822
nepotism and all that
bullshit... but screw it.

835
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:34,957
You can start
under the junior editors,

836
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,159
you know, learn something.

837
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:37,827
- No, thank you.
- Why not?

838
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,095
I mean,
what's wrong with learning

839
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:40,363
- the publishing business?
- Nothing.

840
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:43,499
It's fine. It's just it's...

841
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:45,501
Serviceable.

842
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:58,414
W.F.?

843
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:01,150
I just want
to get my essays back.

844
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,152
Hey.

845
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,615
Thomas.

846
00:48:05,617 --> 00:48:07,617
I was in your apartment.

847
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:14,090
You're Julian stellars.

848
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:16,926
Mm, my nom de plume.

849
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:19,495
You've had 12 books published.

850
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:21,230
You don't have
much mass appeal,

851
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,366
but you don't seem to mind.

852
00:48:23,368 --> 00:48:26,535
Hard to find
a picture of you anywhere.

853
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:28,671
You're an alcoholic
who spends most afternoons

854
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:30,539
drinking in the Brooklyn inn.

855
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:32,608
And you're probably
the only person that I've met

856
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:36,345
that's actually, actually been
to an opium den.

857
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,616
- And I've been googled.
- Mm-hmm.

858
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,357
I didn't read it.

859
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,092
Your new manuscript.

860
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:56,265
Well, Thomas,
i appreciate that.

861
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,507
So, um...

862
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,111
when you said
i had talent...

863
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:12,114
It was a professional opinion.

864
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,287
I don't know, man. I...

865
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:19,989
You've experienced the world.

866
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:22,158
I just live here in New York.

867
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,126
New York is the world.

868
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:26,395
I haven't done much
with my life.

869
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:33,302
You've had sex
with your father's mistress.

870
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:36,305
I'd say that's something.

871
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,743
Am I the only living boy
in New York?

872
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,150
You are.

873
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:08,371
<i>Hey, I was
outside your apartment.</i>

874
00:50:08,373 --> 00:50:10,039
<i>You're not there.</i>

875
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:12,475
I brought the essays.
I wanted to show you.

876
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:55,084
Did you sleep with her?

877
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,790
With who?

878
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,096
Johanna?

879
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:09,365
Why would you ask that?

880
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:12,535
They left the wedding
as quickly as we did.

881
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:16,172
I may be oblivious,
but I'm not stupid.

882
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:17,239
Why do you care?

883
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,641
- I just do.
- Why?

884
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:20,376
Thomas.

885
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:22,378
- Are you jealous?
- No.

886
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,113
- You sure?
- Thomas.

887
00:51:24,115 --> 00:51:26,415
- I think you're jealous.
- Did you sleep with her?

888
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,251
She's my father's mistress.

889
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,287
You think that I would do that?

890
00:51:33,323 --> 00:51:35,124
No.

891
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:36,859
Thank you.

892
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:41,263
You're sweet.

893
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:43,399
You're not like them.

894
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:45,534
- Like who?
- This city.

895
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,413
I want you to stop seeing him.

896
00:51:57,415 --> 00:51:59,415
Come on,
I'm putting my foot down.

897
00:51:59,417 --> 00:52:01,317
You don't get to tell me
what to do, Thomas.

898
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:03,185
I don't care
if your foot's down or up.

899
00:52:03,187 --> 00:52:04,887
Why? 'Cause you don't care
about anything?

900
00:52:04,889 --> 00:52:08,424
- What? -You obviously don't
care about anything at all.

901
00:52:08,426 --> 00:52:11,160
Oh, so I'm a nihilist now,
am I?

902
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:18,234
I don't know anything
about you.

903
00:52:18,236 --> 00:52:20,236
Where'd you grow up?

904
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:22,771
Brooklyn, Thomas.
That's why I have this accent.

905
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,309
Did you play sports?

906
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,613
No.

907
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:32,715
When did you first have sex?

908
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:35,784
Oh, my god, we're gonna talk
about my childhood now?

909
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:38,854
Yeah. I want to know you.

910
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:41,757
Where'd you grow up?

911
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:43,926
I grew up in London.

912
00:52:43,928 --> 00:52:46,395
Which part?

913
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:49,398
Belsize park.

914
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,467
And then kilburn.

915
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,602
Why the move?

916
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:57,339
Because kilburn's
so much more real.

917
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:58,807
What'd your dad do?

918
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,479
What'd your dad do?

919
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:07,483
He put a gun in his mouth
and pulled the trigger.

920
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:19,795
I'm sorry.

921
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,802
I didn't know.

922
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:33,542
Why do you sleep with me?

923
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,311
Because I like you.

924
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:38,581
What do you like about me?

925
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:40,950
Your innocence.

926
00:53:40,952 --> 00:53:43,919
Were you ever innocent?

927
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:45,654
I forgot.

928
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:48,657
Come on. Tell me.

929
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:50,659
I want to know
about when you were innocent.

930
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:53,529
- Why?
- Because I like the idea of it.

931
00:53:53,531 --> 00:53:56,298
If you want someone so pure,
why are you with me?

932
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,300
Because I care about you.

933
00:54:02,305 --> 00:54:05,841
Do you care about me?

934
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:08,410
I don't care about anyone,
remember?

935
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:14,416
<i>But the truth was
she cared about them both.</i>

936
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,485
<i>And that's when she knew</i>

937
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:18,821
<i>this mess
would only get worse.</i>

938
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:23,726
<i>She had to make a clean break,
starting with Ethan.</i>

939
00:54:23,728 --> 00:54:26,462
<i>What she didn't anticipate was</i>

940
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:28,697
<i>he'd surrendered too much
of his past</i>

941
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:30,566
<i>to give up on his future.</i>

942
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:37,573
They're all moving
to, uh, Los Angeles.

943
00:54:37,575 --> 00:54:39,975
New York, we're becoming...

944
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:43,445
<i>Do you think
he's in love with her?</i>

945
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:44,713
This has to stop.

946
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:47,049
Eh, you and your father,

947
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:49,918
you suffer from
the same disease.

948
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,987
Johanna.

949
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:56,058
"Visions of Johanna
conquer my mind."

950
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,594
- Mm.
- Why are you writing about me?

951
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,465
That's what I do.

952
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:07,536
I write about people I know
and then give it a thin veil.

953
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:09,672
But why me?

954
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,542
Look, I...

955
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:15,878
I got the apartment
to get out of the house

956
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,880
and write
a completely different story.

957
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:20,349
It just, it didn't
come across, you know?

958
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:22,618
- And mine did.
- Um...

959
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,621
And like everything good,
it happened by accident.

960
00:55:25,623 --> 00:55:28,691
I met you. Now I got 118 pages.

961
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:32,561
My father's publishing house,

962
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:34,830
they're throwing
an anniversary party tomorrow.

963
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:36,632
You should come.

964
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:40,636
No.

965
00:55:40,638 --> 00:55:43,906
You've heard all about these
people, but you never met 'em.

966
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:47,509
Be good for the book.

967
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,644
Huh.

968
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:51,980
Find a window. Pounce.

969
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:53,982
Pounce.

970
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,571
I broke up with Nick.

971
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,408
Did you?

972
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:27,750
You're supposed to be
more excited than that.

973
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:10,859
Hey.

974
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:12,995
Thanks for coming.

975
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:14,530
It's a great party.

976
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:16,632
Yeah. It always is.

977
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:19,601
Look. That's my mother
and Mimi.

978
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,542
She's beautiful.

979
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:28,177
Mm. I told you she was.

980
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:30,512
I was talking about
your mother.

981
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,517
Huh.

982
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,633
It's amazing.

983
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,035
It is amazing,
but I think you could...

984
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:54,470
Uh, sorry.

985
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:55,804
I want you to come
meet someone.

986
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:58,073
Oh! Who are we meeting?

987
00:57:58,075 --> 00:57:59,942
- We're meeting my new friend.
- Your new friend.

988
00:57:59,944 --> 00:58:01,510
- All right, I'll be back.
- Sorry. See you later.

989
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:02,511
I'll be back.

990
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,117
He was just here.

991
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,919
He was?

992
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:12,988
Oh, well, I'll meet him later.

993
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,123
- Come on. He was just here.
- Oh, there's Diana.

994
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:33,809
"I have looked down upon
the city from high windows."

995
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:37,880
"It is then
that the great buildings"

996
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:42,251
"lose reality and take on
their magical powers."

997
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:50,826
"Squares and squares of flame
set and cut into the ether.

998
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:53,762
Here's our poetry, for..."

999
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:57,032
"For we have pulled down
the stars to our will."

1000
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:58,767
"To our will."

1001
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:00,569
Ezra pound.

1002
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,706
Johanna, I'm assuming.

1003
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,109
We haven't met, have we?

1004
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:10,579
No, but I know you very well.

1005
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:14,850
And I know
that you're having your fun

1006
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:17,119
and that he's young and easy.

1007
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:21,323
But you'll have me to deal with
if he scars.

1008
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:29,064
I don't like
strange conversations...

1009
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,066
So I'm gonna walk away now.

1010
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:02,965
I'll be back in a second.

1011
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,040
Hey.

1012
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:13,976
Uh...

1013
01:00:13,978 --> 01:00:16,244
What?

1014
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:18,947
I really think we should
stop seeing each other.

1015
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:22,684
- Thomas.
- What?

1016
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:25,120
It looks bad. Come on.

1017
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:28,924
I was ending it
with your father as well.

1018
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:31,193
And not because
i didn't care for him.

1019
01:00:31,195 --> 01:00:34,663
I actually really do.
I care for him very much.

1020
01:00:34,665 --> 01:00:37,366
But, Thomas,
the thing is he proposed.

1021
01:00:37,368 --> 01:00:39,067
What?

1022
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:42,270
And I said yes.

1023
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:44,206
No. No.

1024
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:46,141
- No, no. -Please, I don't
want this to be disruptive.

1025
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,677
- Disruptive? He's not gonna leave her.
- Stop, stop, stop.

1026
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:50,379
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1027
01:00:50,381 --> 01:00:52,381
No, this is
the best thing for everybody.

1028
01:00:52,383 --> 01:00:53,949
- For who?
- For everybody.

1029
01:00:53,951 --> 01:00:55,651
Judith's gonna be
so much better off.

1030
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:56,885
She won't be suffering anymore

1031
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:58,687
under the weight
of a dead marriage.

1032
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:00,288
He's going through a cri...
He's just going through

1033
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:02,024
a fucking crisis,
that's all this is.

1034
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:03,859
Come on, this doesn't
have to be this difficult.

1035
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:06,228
Please, everybody can win here.

1036
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,697
God made a mistake
when he made you beautiful.

1037
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,365
Well, god's mistake
is marrying your father.

1038
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:12,134
Not yet she isn't.

1039
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:14,403
Look, can I just ask you
one thing?

1040
01:01:14,405 --> 01:01:17,773
If any of this comes out, who
do you think's gonna get hurt?

1041
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:19,041
It's not me.

1042
01:01:19,043 --> 01:01:20,842
It's not Ethan.

1043
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:23,378
We both know how to land
on our feet. And it's not you.

1044
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,447
- You're so young.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1045
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:28,450
There's one person... one
person who will be destroyed,

1046
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:30,118
and we both know who that is.

1047
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,887
What do you think's
gonna happen?

1048
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:33,855
You think you can get married,
you think you can have

1049
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:36,024
the obligatory second family
and live happily ever after

1050
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,426
in your dream world?

1051
01:01:37,428 --> 01:01:39,995
Well, obviously
that can't happen.

1052
01:01:39,997 --> 01:01:43,331
What is that supposed to mean?

1053
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,400
- Wait, what is that
supposed to mean? -Hey.

1054
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:47,402
What is it supposed to mean?

1055
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:49,137
Stop it.

1056
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:55,210
- Stop it, Thomas. Come on.
- I'm gonna tell him everything.

1057
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,946
- I'm gonna tell him. Don't...
- Thomas.

1058
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:50,932
Thomas!

1059
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,871
Thomas, what are you doing?

1060
01:02:55,873 --> 01:02:57,072
It's raining.

1061
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,945
Um...

1062
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,347
Okay.

1063
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:09,251
I...

1064
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:12,220
I broke up with Nick...

1065
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:15,223
Because I got into Croatia.

1066
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:19,261
And I want you to come with me.

1067
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,973
I slept with Johanna.

1068
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,544
No.

1069
01:03:35,546 --> 01:03:39,014
You're not like that.

1070
01:03:39,016 --> 01:03:42,017
- And I thought that I was
in love with her. -Mm-mm.

1071
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,288
You're good.

1072
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,994
No, Mimi, I'm not good.

1073
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,268
Mimi!

1074
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,004
Mimi!

1075
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:12,347
I'm sorry.

1076
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,550
You are just like them.

1077
01:04:15,552 --> 01:04:17,552
They won, Thomas.

1078
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:20,155
God, they've fucking
bankrupted you.

1079
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:41,937
- Hey. -Thomas!
Did you spend last night here?

1080
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:43,605
Yeah.

1081
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:47,642
Well, that was the best party
that kenta has thrown in years.

1082
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:50,312
Everybody was drunk... and
not just our alcoholic friends,

1083
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:52,247
but everybody.

1084
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:54,416
Why did you spend the night?

1085
01:05:54,418 --> 01:05:56,418
I don't know.

1086
01:05:56,420 --> 01:06:00,255
I just... wanted to come home.

1087
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:02,257
Are you upset?

1088
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,661
Tell me about it.

1089
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,266
What?

1090
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:13,535
Is it about a girl?

1091
01:06:13,537 --> 01:06:16,705
And I'm your mother, so...

1092
01:06:16,707 --> 01:06:19,407
Things have gotten messy,
and...

1093
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:21,543
I want to bail.

1094
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:26,548
But I can't.

1095
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:28,550
Well, then you know.

1096
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:36,157
The only way out... is through.

1097
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,692
Right?

1098
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:41,563
Where's dad?

1099
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:43,431
He left early.

1100
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:46,568
He said he had to go to
the office and get some files.

1101
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:50,171
He seems to have
gotten over what a...

1102
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,358
Thomas?

1103
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,735
- Dad?
- Thomas. Huh.

1104
01:07:20,737 --> 01:07:22,637
- We need to talk.
- Mm-hmm.

1105
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:24,339
There are...
There are some things

1106
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:25,607
- that you don't know that...
- Thomas, don't.

1107
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:27,609
- Don't.
- That you need to know.

1108
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:32,680
Johanna.

1109
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:34,816
You two know each other?

1110
01:07:34,818 --> 01:07:36,351
Yeah.

1111
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,355
What?

1112
01:07:40,357 --> 01:07:42,290
Well, Ethan,
the thing is, is that...

1113
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:43,691
He followed me.

1114
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:46,161
You followed her?

1115
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,631
That's not all I did.

1116
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:58,406
I'm sorry, I...

1117
01:07:58,408 --> 01:07:59,808
I don't understand.

1118
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:07,382
We slept together.

1119
01:08:07,384 --> 01:08:09,717
And not just once.

1120
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:13,655
What?

1121
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:35,477
You slick little shit, you!

1122
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:37,345
- I did right by you!
- No, relax!

1123
01:08:37,347 --> 01:08:38,746
- You have no idea!
- Relax!

1124
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:40,582
You have no idea!

1125
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,294
Oh.

1126
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:00,568
Oh.

1127
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:14,749
I deserve you.

1128
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:46,548
I'm sorry.

1129
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:50,552
We're all sorry, Thomas.

1130
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:55,490
I really do love him.

1131
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:06,234
And he did right by you.

1132
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:09,971
More than you know.

1133
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,912
Good-bye, Thomas.

1134
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:33,855
Did you finish it?

1135
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:39,460
I did.

1136
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,462
Tell me about it.

1137
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:48,469
Tell me about "the only
living boy in New York."

1138
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:56,477
Uh, well...

1139
01:12:02,385 --> 01:12:05,620
It's about three people...
artists...

1140
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,622
And great friends.

1141
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:13,528
One of them is
a beautiful young girl.

1142
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:15,063
The other two...

1143
01:12:15,065 --> 01:12:18,066
One artist has talent,
the other doesn't.

1144
01:12:18,068 --> 01:12:20,668
You know,
no matter how hard he tries,

1145
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,037
and no matter
how badly he wants it,

1146
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,506
he just...

1147
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:27,809
Well, he wasn't kissed by god
in that way.

1148
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:29,944
But he has the girl.

1149
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:33,514
Yes. And they're married,

1150
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:37,085
and they plan
to start a family.

1151
01:12:37,087 --> 01:12:40,054
Only they have
a little problem.

1152
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:42,724
He's infertile.

1153
01:12:42,726 --> 01:12:45,660
And they ask
their talented friend for help?

1154
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:50,398
Yeah, you have a knack
for a story, Thomas.

1155
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:54,435
I get it from my father.

1156
01:12:54,437 --> 01:12:55,937
Uh-huh.

1157
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,548
So...

1158
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:11,953
So, they're artists, and they
don't want to use in vitro,

1159
01:13:11,955 --> 01:13:14,956
so they go with
a cheap bottle of cabernet

1160
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:18,626
and, uh, some quaaludes
and a Simon & Garfunkel record,

1161
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:20,628
and the three of them decide...

1162
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:23,498
And-and... the husband's
okay with that?

1163
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:26,434
Well, th-they want to use
somebody that they know,

1164
01:13:26,436 --> 01:13:28,903
somebody that they love.

1165
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:33,107
Well, and, of course,
the artist with the talent,

1166
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:37,712
he's, uh, he's flattered,
and, of course, he agrees.

1167
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:42,150
And, uh, he and the...

1168
01:13:42,152 --> 01:13:44,652
The beautiful girl...

1169
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:51,459
they...

1170
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:54,796
Uh, they walk the city streets
that night...

1171
01:13:54,798 --> 01:13:56,063
For hours.

1172
01:13:56,065 --> 01:13:59,500
They're both so damn nervous.

1173
01:13:59,502 --> 01:14:03,004
And they end up
at Washington square park...

1174
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:08,643
where they dance...

1175
01:14:08,645 --> 01:14:12,613
Uh... to no music.

1176
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:17,618
And the rest comes easy.

1177
01:14:20,757 --> 01:14:22,623
And does he love her?

1178
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:26,494
Yeah, he... he does. Mm.

1179
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:29,497
In that moment,
he realizes he does.

1180
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:39,774
Uh, so it turns out that...

1181
01:14:39,776 --> 01:14:43,911
That the beautiful girl,

1182
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:46,080
she gives birth
to a wonderful son,

1183
01:14:46,082 --> 01:14:49,951
and her husband gives up art,

1184
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:52,820
becomes a very successful
art dealer.

1185
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:55,823
And the other artist?

1186
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:03,064
He watches the boy grow
from afar, huh?

1187
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:07,835
Sees his own talent alive
in this child.

1188
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:16,878
He so desperately wants
to connect with his son...

1189
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,880
And tell him everything.

1190
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:26,020
And nurture
his talent, you know?

1191
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:37,698
But, of course,
he never does make contact.

1192
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:43,571
Until...

1193
01:15:43,573 --> 01:15:46,841
Until he decides
to make it all his next book.

1194
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:03,858
It's okay.

1195
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:24,879
Mom.

1196
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:35,089
Thomas.

1197
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:38,926
What did he tell you?

1198
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:41,295
Everything.

1199
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,900
You here looking for razors?

1200
01:16:45,902 --> 01:16:47,902
Empty pill bottles?

1201
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:52,039
Sit down.

1202
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:02,683
What do you know, Thomas?

1203
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:05,920
I know...

1204
01:17:05,922 --> 01:17:08,089
I know why you carry
so much guilt.

1205
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,661
I know that I...

1206
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:15,663
Already forgive you.

1207
01:17:15,665 --> 01:17:17,098
I know you're in love
with someone

1208
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,200
you haven't seen
in over 25 years.

1209
01:17:19,202 --> 01:17:22,269
And you go to riverside park
every day to read his books.

1210
01:17:22,271 --> 01:17:25,239
I know.
I know, and it's okay.

1211
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:31,212
- Who told you?
- He did.

1212
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:32,947
Julian. W.F.

1213
01:17:32,949 --> 01:17:34,882
Whatever you want to call him.

1214
01:17:34,884 --> 01:17:37,351
Is he dying?

1215
01:17:38,388 --> 01:17:40,087
He's not dying.

1216
01:17:40,089 --> 01:17:42,957
- No?
- Don't worry, he's not dying.

1217
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:45,126
He's fine. He's just...

1218
01:17:45,128 --> 01:17:46,861
I don't know, he's tired.

1219
01:17:46,863 --> 01:17:48,429
Think he's lonely.

1220
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:53,434
It was my idea
not to tell you, not Ethan's.

1221
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:55,836
- You have to know that.
- Okay.

1222
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,872
You were trying to protect me.

1223
01:17:57,874 --> 01:18:00,408
Yes, and...

1224
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:03,411
And I knew that
if you found out,

1225
01:18:03,413 --> 01:18:05,279
he would
come back into my life,

1226
01:18:05,281 --> 01:18:07,381
and then everything
would go to shit.

1227
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:09,917
Well, everything went to shit
on its own, so...

1228
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:14,021
Yeah, I guess.

1229
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:27,134
Is he old?

1230
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:30,738
He's messy.

1231
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:34,275
Yeah, he always was.

1232
01:18:34,277 --> 01:18:36,277
An unmade bed of a man.

1233
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:39,747
"An unmade bed of a man."

1234
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:42,750
I like that.

1235
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:44,885
You should.

1236
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:47,488
Your father wrote it.

1237
01:19:22,058 --> 01:19:23,491
We're closed.

1238
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:28,362
I'm sorry, I thought
i locked the door.

1239
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,938
- Hey.
- Hey.

1240
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,940
I'll be quick.

1241
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:41,342
I know what book I want.

1242
01:19:41,344 --> 01:19:42,543
Sure.

1243
01:19:47,483 --> 01:19:49,016
Hmm.

1244
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:52,253
What'd you think?

1245
01:19:52,255 --> 01:19:54,255
Serviceable.

1246
01:19:55,858 --> 01:19:57,958
You're lying
to make me feel good.

1247
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:03,097
Character that surprised me
the most was the father.

1248
01:20:07,369 --> 01:20:08,969
Which one?

1249
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:13,007
The one that didn't run away.

1250
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:20,181
Whatever happened to Mimi?

1251
01:20:20,183 --> 01:20:21,916
She's still in Croatia.

1252
01:20:21,918 --> 01:20:23,284
She got a fellowship.

1253
01:20:23,286 --> 01:20:25,452
I don't think
she's coming back.

1254
01:20:25,454 --> 01:20:28,155
Oh.

1255
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:30,157
Did you hear back from viking?

1256
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:31,992
Yeah, it was a pass.

1257
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,928
I'm sorry.

1258
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:36,263
You want me to make
a few phone calls?

1259
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:40,267
No.

1260
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:42,136
I want to start something new.

1261
01:20:42,138 --> 01:20:43,938
I ha... have an idea.

1262
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:47,007
Well, that's good.

1263
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,009
You still speaking to Johanna?

1264
01:20:49,011 --> 01:20:50,411
No.

1265
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:55,049
- You lying to me?
- Yeah.

1266
01:20:57,553 --> 01:20:59,053
- How's your mother?
- She's good.

1267
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:01,222
She quit smoking.

1268
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:03,557
<i>Started writing
for artnews again.</i>

1269
01:21:03,559 --> 01:21:05,292
- That's good.
- Yeah.

1270
01:21:05,294 --> 01:21:06,894
She has a date tonight.

1271
01:21:06,896 --> 01:21:08,896
Oh, good for her.

1272
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:12,199
Truly.

1273
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:15,903
"The best lack all conviction,

1274
01:21:15,905 --> 01:21:18,973
while the worst are full of
passionate intensity."

1275
01:21:18,975 --> 01:21:22,309
Yeats said that,
but so did Lou Reed.
