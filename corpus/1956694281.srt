1798
01:07:44,495 --> 01:07:46,540

Peter Lake set him up.

But I still believe that

everyone is innocent until

I knocked on her door,

2267
01:24:56,178 --> 01:24:57,179
I talked to the manager.

2268
01:24:57,222 --> 01:24:58,528
He said she checked out.

2269
01:24:58,571 --> 01:25:00,269
>> What?

2270
01:25:00,312 --> 01:25:01,748
>> Fellas, what's up?

2271
01:25:01,792 --> 01:25:03,489
>> Nancy Gordon's in the wind.

2272
01:25:03,533 --> 01:25:04,664
>> You're kidding.

2273
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:05,622
You sure?

2274
01:25:05,665 --> 01:25:06,579
>> Yeah, without a trace.

2275
01:25:06,623 --> 01:25:07,711
Not even the black rose

2276
01:25:07,754 --> 01:25:09,582
and the note.

2277
01:25:09,626 --> 01:25:11,018
>> But she's half our case.

2278
01:25:11,062 --> 01:25:12,846

2279
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:13,804
And I don't need you looking

2280
01:25:13,847 --> 01:25:14,935
at me like that.

2281
01:25:14,979 --> 01:25:15,893
>> Like what?

2282
01:25:15,936 --> 01:25:16,937

2283
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:18,113
arrest Darius until I had more

2284
01:25:18,156 --> 01:25:19,070

01:25:22,378 --> 01:25:23,292
the same thing.

2290
01:25:24,336 --> 01:25:25,903

2291
01:25:25,946 --> 01:25:26,860
Find her.
