1
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,999
- No chance in hell.
- Nah.

2
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,509
- They're a bunch of bimbos,
they can't play ball.

3
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,279
- I've got our whole
neck bet on this game.

4
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,710
If we don't win, we're
gonna be out on our asses.

5
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,479
- I've never let you down
before, I promise you, Dad,

6
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,703
I'll win this game for you.

7
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,267
Go!

8
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,239
- Come on, guys, first,
come on, hurry, come on,

9
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,541
go, oh shit!

10
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,159
You son of a bitch!

11
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,268
Over here!

12
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,183
Nice try, handsome.

13
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,839
Bitch.

14
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,559
Have a nice day, asshole.

15
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,226
Hey Babe.

16
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,399
I've been waiting
for this all day.

17
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,021
Come on, bring it on,
come on, in to Papa.

18
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,462
Strike!

19
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,703
- Don't let them knockers
hypnotize you, boy!

20
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,623
- All right, all right,
let's see you do that again.

21
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,501
Strike two!

22
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,700
You're out!
- Shit!

23
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,107
Bitch!

24
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,502
Shit.

25
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,503
Oh come on, Holt!

26
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,439
Why can't you pick up the ball?

27
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,584
What the hell is wrong with you?

28
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,741
Asshole.

29
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,468
Let me go!

30
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,666
Come on, come on, come on!

31
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,159
Hey honey, let me
show you my bat, huh?

32
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,279
Get away!

33
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,079
What you doing tonight?

34
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,188
Hey!

35
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,479
What in the hell is happening?

36
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,704
- Hey you son of a
bitch, god damn it!

37
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,159
Way to go, Roy!

38
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,859
Wait a minute!

39
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,703
Stoney, you're gonna be okay.

40
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,785
God, come on, Stoney.

41
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,079
Come on.

42
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,479
You're gonna pay for
this, you bastards!

43
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,519
Come on.

44
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,239
Stoney, you okay?

45
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,179
- Get some ice,
get some ice, Babe.

46
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,559
Look at me, Stoney, you alright?

47
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,100
Yeah, I'm okay.

48
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,279
- In case you ladies
haven't noticed

49
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,439
these nose pickers
are sore losers.

50
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,079
So what the hell are we
gonna do about it, huh?

51
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,759
- We're gonna kick some ass!
- We're gonna kill them!

52
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,709
All right!

53
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,279
Yeah!

54
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,503
You're a dead mother.

55
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,186
Come on, come on!

56
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,719
- Come on, Babe,
right here, honey,

57
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,022
come on baby, let's
get this sucker.

58
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,639
Leave me alone!

59
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,988
Just trying to help you!

60
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,787
Asshole!

61
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,860
You're out!

62
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,027
Yeah.

63
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,079
- Alright you
guys, go, one more!

64
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,189
Damn it, you're out!

65
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,359
You're out!

66
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,025
Bunch of losers!

67
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,425
Strike three.

68
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,100
You're out!

69
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,667
Alright!

70
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,026
Yeah, woo!

71
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,906
I'm okay.

72
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,182
Hey Roy.

73
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,799
Yeah?

74
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,067
Come here.

75
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,679
You disappointed me today, son.

76
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,079
Come on, it was just a game.

77
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,223
<i>We never 'gust a game.</i>

78
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,679
How do you think I survived
those God damn wars?

79
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,239
You win, you survive.

80
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,542
You lose, you have nothing.

81
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,559
I dropped a thousand
bucks on your ass today

82
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,159
betting on this game.

83
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,940
I lost another 500 bringing
the bimbos up here.

84
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,346
Mino Collins doesn't lose.

85
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,759
How could you do that to me?

86
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,959
- Guess I'm just a
little too much like Mom.

87
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,759
- Don't you ever say
something like that to me.

88
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,300
You're my son.

89
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,982
Now go get yourself
cleaned up, boy.

90
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,470
I'll take care of this here.

91
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,427
Hey Roy.

92
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,540
Happy birthday, son.

93
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,199
- Hey Mino, I warned you not
to bet against a sure thing.

94
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,959
My compliments, coach,

95
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,959
your ladies performed
their tits and ass routine

96
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,079
extremely well.

97
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,959
Enough to send your boys home

98
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,199
with some high,
squeaky voices, huh?

99
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,799
Now about that
thousand you owe me?

100
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,626
- You'll get what you're
owed, I'll send a messenger.

101
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,719
<i>Make sure you do that, Mme.</i>

102
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,386
Today, old Midnight
hit a home run.

103
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,348
I'll see you around.

104
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,300
Way to go.

105
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,719
Hey!

106
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,359
Let's go!

107
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,460
Hey Louisa.

108
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,119
Girl, if I had your equipment

109
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,559
I would move to Beverly
Hills and be a movie star.

110
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,559
- I think Dad needs
to raise the stakes.

111
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,839
These guys are getting
to be too easy.

112
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,744
Not easy, Babe, sleazy.

113
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,350
- I don't know about
you girls, I need a man.

114
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,346
- G-string's going up
my butt, I hate that.

115
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,140
I can't even find my G-spot.

116
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,399
Tonight we are in search of.

117
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,179
The G-spot!

118
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,279
You know Babe,

119
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,719
I really wish that we could
settle down somewhere.

120
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,759
- Listen, as soon as
Dad pays out his debts,

121
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,239
we'll be home free.

122
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,399
- He's always saying that
and nothing ever changes.

123
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,119
You'll see.

124
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,119
Promise?

125
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,228
- Promise.
- Okay.

126
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,824
God, that feels great.

127
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,060
Great job, girls, as usual.

128
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,544
I don't believe
it, dirty old man.

129
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,599
Oh, that's my bad arm.

130
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,300
Oh shit, that's my bad neck.

131
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,279
- Let's give
him a cold shower!

132
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,279
Hey girls, come on, cover up!

133
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,106
Horny old man coming through.

134
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,559
What the hell is this human
jock strap doing here?

135
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,959
Hi coach.

136
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,239
Mr. Collins sent me.

137
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,508
I got your money for ya.

138
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,061
Here's your money, coach.

139
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,159
- The bet was for
a thousand dollars.

140
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,304
- That's all Mr.
Collins gave me.

141
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,679
Oh come on, numb nuts.

142
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,519
You know something, I bet
you got it on you, don't you?

143
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,159
All right girls take him apart.

144
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,508
Coach, coach, coach!

145
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,021
Dad!

146
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,079
Where are you going?

147
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,159
To take care of some business.

148
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,383
Be careful, please.

149
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,839
- Look honey, don't
worry about me.

150
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,119
You get the girls on the bus

151
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,263
and when I'm through
we're out of here.

152
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,348
Coach, coach, coach.

153
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,279
Come on, Roy, come on.

154
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,945
There's no such thing as pain.

155
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,859
Come on, Roy.

156
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,759
Shit, Roy.

157
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,279
Come on, you're burning my arm.

158
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,581
I win, asshole.

159
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,279
- We sure showed them bimbos
today, didn't we, Roy?

160
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,359
- I wouldn't mind showing
them one more big thing.

161
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,279
Hey son, how's your belly?

162
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,719
Hard as a rock.

163
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,399
Aim a little lower next time

164
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,349
I gotta drain the vein

165
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,829
- Hey, we need some more
popcorn here, alright?

166
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,999
Roy, you burned my arm,
you burned it bad too.

167
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,399
I want you to know that.

168
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,559
Here, here, here.

169
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,479
You don't even give a shit.

170
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,782
I don't believe you, man.

171
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,459
- Here you go, Babe.
- Thanks.

172
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,239
- This is almost as bad as those
lumberjacks, remember guys?

173
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,319
- Oh yeah.
- Oregon.

174
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,759
- This team has a
hell of a history.

175
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,223
- At least we're on
a winning streak.

176
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,141
- You okay?
- Yeah.

177
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,349
Thanks.

178
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,279
You don't look too good.

179
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,359
- No I'm not, I'm a
little dizzy, it's okay.

180
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,479
It's alright, it's gone.

181
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,439
It's okay.
- You sure?

182
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,679
Yeah, I'm sure, it's okay.

183
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,599
Thanks, it's okay, you guys.

184
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,399
- I wish Dad would just
forget about that money

185
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,860
and get us out of here.

186
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,319
Maybe we should go get him.

187
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,999
Yeah, I think we should.

188
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,199
- We're not supposed
to leave the bus, you guys.

189
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,719
Well I'm going.

190
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,319
- Mickey!
- I'm coming with you.

191
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,119
- I thought you mercenaries
were men of your word.

192
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,919
We are.

193
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,302
- Well then pay up,
you son of a bitch.

194
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,702
- You're fucking with
the devil now, boy.

195
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,559
- You know what I
need just about now?

196
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,319
- I know what I need, I
need some more popcorn.

197
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,702
No, pussy, you dumb shit.

198
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,541
You wanna help me find it?

199
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,786
Hell yeah.

200
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,639
I knew you'd say that.

201
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,340
Let's get the fuck out of here.

202
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,239
- I'd say we're gonna
have some fun, Roy.

203
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,542
- We're gonna have
some fun, here, here.

204
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,479
- Yeah, you said we're
gonna get some pussy.

205
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,021
We're gonna get some pussy.

206
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,959
Hey girls.

207
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,919
We were wondering
where you girls were.

208
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,239
What do you want?

209
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,559
- Well, we invited
you over to party.

210
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,839
That's right.

211
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,599
- I don't wanna come
to your party, scumbag.

212
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,426
Ooh, that hurt, huh?

213
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,679
You beat us bad today.

214
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,479
- Alright girls,
let's strap it in.

215
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,519
We're blowing this
God damn dump.

216
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,879
- Midnight, we can't
go anywhere right yet.

217
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,599
Mickey and Connie are out
there looking for you.

218
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,599
We have to wait for them.

219
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,439
- Damn it, I told you
not to leave the bus!

220
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,359
Shit.

221
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,679
Dad, I'm going with you.

222
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,159
- You stay here and don't
leave the God damn bus, okay?

223
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,508
Shut up!

224
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,879
- Come on, I'm
gonna give it to you.

225
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,988
Daddy!

226
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,266
Oh my God, that's Mickey.

227
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,387
Daddy!

228
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,839
Daddy!
- Son of a bitch!

229
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,639
What the hell?

230
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,430
Son of a bitch!

231
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,380
I got him, Roy!

232
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,020
Holt!

233
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,039
Get out of here!

234
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,341
Shit, Roy.

235
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,159
You bastard!

236
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,980
Oh Shit.

237
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,519
- Fucking bitches!
- Come on, Roy!

238
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,105
Daddy, Daddy.

239
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,426
Girls, quick, to the bus.

240
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,999
What's the matter, buddy?

241
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,144
You need blasting
caps or something?

242
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,748
Holy shit, Mr. Collins!

243
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,980
- Mickey, he'll be
okay, I promise you.

244
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,220
Easy.

245
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,559
Give me a glass of water.

246
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,226
Somebody get me some towels.

247
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,426
Wanda, get us out of here!

248
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,839
Shit.

249
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,679
- Roy, we're in big
trouble this time.

250
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,426
Roy, what are you doing?
- Fuck!

251
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,759
- Roy, we gotta do
something about your leg, Roy.

252
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,919
Shut up!

253
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,028
Check it!

254
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,267
Get him from the side!

255
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,999
No!

256
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,068
Roy!

257
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,999
Mr. Collins, Mr.
Collins, Mr. Collins,

258
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,224
Mr. Collins, Mr.
Collins, Mr. Collins!

259
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,785
Come on, where's Mr. Collins?

260
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,107
Mr. Collins, Mr. Collins!

261
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,039
- It's them baseball bitches
clone it, Mr. Collins.

262
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,261
Killed him dead.

263
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,959
- Roy and I went over and
saw some of them girls,

264
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,999
Mr. Collins, and then coach
came out with a baseball bat

265
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,119
and he started hitting on us.

266
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,679
They got back on the bus
and they came after Roy.

267
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,867
Heard enough!

268
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,226
That's my son there.

269
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,500
I want justice!

270
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,519
Are you with me?

271
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,919
- Yes sir, Mr. Collins.
- We sure are.

272
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,439
You can count on us.

273
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,759
I'll pay a thousand dollars

274
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,439
for every one of
them bitches dead.

275
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,105
Don't bring 'em back alive.

276
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,383
Sounds good.

277
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,639
- Holt, you take Verne,
pick up their trail.

278
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,919
- Yes sir, Mr. Collins,
come on, Verne.

279
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,519
- The rest of you
stand by your CB's

280
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,479
and wait for my command.

281
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,079
Now move out!

282
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,268
Yes sir, Mr. Collins.

283
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,860
- You'll pay for this,
Roy, I promise you that.

284
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,264
- You okay, Stoney?
- I'm okay.

285
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,999
- Babe, Stoney needs
to get to the doctor

286
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,826
and we've got to call the cops.

287
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,079
Hey!

288
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,319
I think I see help.

289
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,621
Thank God.

290
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,107
Hello?

291
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,068
Is there anybody here?

292
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,144
You okay, baby?

293
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,199
- Are those
bimbos there yet?

294
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,959
Are they there?

295
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,341
Ronnie!

296
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,239
Let me go!

297
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,639
You're going nowhere, bitch!

298
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,199
- Maybe I should go check
and see what's going on.

299
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,399
Bitch, you're gonna die!

300
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,220
Here Connie, take the gun!

301
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,959
- Get the hell off me!
- I got you now, bitch!

302
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,439
- Looks like somebody's asses
got trashed around here.

303
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,479
Doesn't appear to be
the bitches either.

304
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,679
Which way did they go?

305
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,746
- Damn it Mr. Collins, heading
north towards Flint Ridge.

306
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,439
- This is Tiger One
calling checkpoint two,

307
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,548
Verne and Holt.

308
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,439
- This is Verne, Mr.
Collins, Holt is taking a-

309
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,901
This is Holt, Mr. Collins.

310
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,590
- They're heading
your ways, boys.

311
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,919
This ain't no bib-whack,
this is a war,

312
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,239
and I aim to win it.

313
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,519
You read me, Holt?

314
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,399
Yes sir, you can count on me.

315
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,639
I read you, Mr. Collins.

316
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,119
- You can't read, Verne,
here, put that away.

317
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,479
- I want you to scout the old
mill area near Townie Falls.

318
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,559
Jake, you and JD go
with him, back him up.

319
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,199
I'm gonna do some recon,
head up in the high country,

320
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,946
see if I can make this operation
a little more feasible.

321
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,147
Move out!

322
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,539
Hi, you okay?

323
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,867
I'll be alright, thanks.

324
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,479
- Verne, I sure hope them
broads come this way.

325
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,359
Roy was my best friend and
I'm gonna pay 'em back.

326
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,639
I'm gonna pay 'em back too.

327
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,359
I get my hands on that pitcher

328
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,999
I'm gonna tear into
her sweet little ass

329
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,559
every which way but loose.

330
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,079
- Hey, Mino didn't say
nothing about doing that.

331
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,622
- Didn't say nothing
about not doing it either.

332
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,279
I bet you this old country
boy teach them city bitches

333
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,679
a thing or two.

334
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,823
- Verne, you can't
beat your own meat.

335
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,824
I beat it better than you can.

336
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,559
Beat that, prick breath.

337
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,420
Okay, ass breath.

338
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,599
- Verne, I swear, you drink
beer the way you piss.

339
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,744
- You piss the way
you drink beer.

340
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,427
God damn, Verne, go on!

341
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,439
I see 'em, Verne, they're
dead, man, I see 'em!

342
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,079
Shoot 'em, Verne!

343
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,839
Damn it, we have company.

344
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,824
Shoot 'em, Verne!

345
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,750
Down, stay down!

346
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,624
Hang on, Verne!

347
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,101
Oh man.

348
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,559
Holt, God damn it!

349
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,599
Slow down, you'll kill us!

350
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,666
- Oh shut up, all
these bitches, come on!

351
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,940
I don't wanna hear it, come on!

352
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,789
There you go,
Verne, get the gun!

353
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,519
Bastards.

354
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,999
Hell Verne, take the wheel!

355
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,108
Huh?

356
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,026
God damn it.

357
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,587
Shit!

358
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,599
I hear him up there, you guys!

359
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,559
Oh my God!

360
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,107
Fuck.

361
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,980
Oh God, oh!

362
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,101
Please Joy, come on!

363
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,239
- Get him,
go Joy, beat his ass!

364
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,467
God damn!

365
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,239
- Eagle two, those
bitches are coming your way.

366
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,519
Are you all set?

367
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,079
- All set
here, Mr. Collins.

368
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,399
Remember the plan then.

369
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,759
- Yes sir, Mr.
Collins, yes sir.

370
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,239
- Good and don't
fuck up this time.

371
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,905
This is a war, not a game.

372
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,839
- Holt?
- What?

373
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,159
You ain't mad at me, are ya?

374
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,542
No, I ain't mad at you.

375
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,399
Dumb son of a bitch.

376
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,463
- I'm sure glad
you're not mad at me.

377
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,622
Stoney's not feeling so good.

378
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,307
- See if you can locate
the nearest town.

379
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,719
- According to this
it'd be Flint Ridge,

380
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,919
it's a couple hours away if
we just stay on this road.

381
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,302
- Providing those bastards
stay off our tail.

382
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,319
Look out, look out!

383
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,919
Shit!

384
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,462
- The broads
are here, Mr. Collins.

385
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,279
- Proceed
according to plan.

386
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,879
You have your orders?

387
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,147
Don't mess up.

388
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,500
- Hey, the dumb
broads took the bait!

389
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,219
- Good work,
men, good work.

390
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,879
Any idea where we're going?

391
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,990
- Do you see
anything on the map?

392
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,303
- Gotta be road up here
somewhere that leads someplace.

393
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,559
- Maybe we should
stop and turn back

394
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,384
and get around that plow there.

395
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,144
No, I'd rather keep moving.

396
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,639
You guys, look where we are.

397
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,625
Look at the denseness here,
we can't even see daylight.

398
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,147
Babe, Babe?

399
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,999
Why are we stopping?

400
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,187
Dead end.

401
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,279
Alright girls, let's pack
it up and get out of here.

402
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,582
- Where to?
- Away from here.

403
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,279
- That's worse, we're gonna
be lost in 10 minutes.

404
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,343
- We'll be dead in
eight if we stay.

405
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,319
- Babe, I think we
ought to stay and fight.

406
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,439
- We can't stay, Donna, we
have to get away from here

407
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,741
so let's go!

408
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,543
- I can't take you
with us, Daddy.

409
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,227
We're in big trouble.

410
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,944
Bye Daddy.

411
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,503
Nothing can hurt them now, baby.

412
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,181
Ingrid?

413
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,380
Come on!

414
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,679
Babe, you're going too fast.

415
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,159
- Shh, keep it down,
we have to get away.

416
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,399
We have to wait for Stoney.

417
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,467
- We won't be able to go far
if she's gonna run like this.

418
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,959
Babe, Babe, Stoney's gone.

419
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,119
I don't know what happened,
she was right behind me.

420
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,546
I'll go back for her.

421
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,389
Let's wait for her down here.

422
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,386
Oh my God.

423
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:28,060
Stoney.

424
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,479
- They killed Stoney.
- What?

425
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,759
Oh no!

426
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,799
- We have to go
back and get her.

427
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,910
- She's dead, we
have to keep moving.

428
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,479
Moving?

429
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,999
Moving where, we don't even
know where the hell we're going.

430
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,119
We're going to Flint Ridge.

431
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,599
That's 30 miles away.

432
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,586
Right, but if we stay, we die.

433
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,399
- Don't you realize the
slime that killed Stoney

434
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,399
is not about to let us
make it to Flint Ridge?

435
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,679
Babe, I am tired of running

436
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,159
and I am really, really
sick of being afraid.

437
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,799
I say that we set a trap

438
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,959
and we kill the bastards now,
that's what they got coming.

439
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,439
Maybe Donna's right.

440
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,439
We have to stick together.

441
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,439
- I have been pushed around
my whole life by lousy men

442
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,359
and I am sick of it.

443
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,319
I say that we just give
them a little taste

444
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,439
of their own medicine right now.

445
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,879
- If you feel that's
what you have to do.

446
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,359
Bitches are gone!

447
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,820
Gimme that.

448
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,099
Well lookie here.

449
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,659
She looks dead.

450
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,559
Come on!

451
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,439
Well lookie here.

452
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,759
I bet you it's still warm!

453
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,150
- Don't you go play
with that, man!

454
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,559
- I'm an adult, I
ain't shitting you.

455
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,919
I'm gonna buy you a new truck

456
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,039
just as soon as we collect
that thousand dollars

457
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,559
for them dead bimbos.

458
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,879
- Verne, this ain't got
nothing to do with the money.

459
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,999
We're doing this 'cause of Roy.

460
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,999
Besides, we ain't gonna bet
off if Mr. Collins still holds.

461
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,279
- Hey, there's
something out there.

462
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,199
You hear something?

463
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,559
Let's get them bitches!

464
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,439
Ronnie, is that you?

465
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,663
Ronnie, is that you?

466
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,839
Fire a shot so we see you!

467
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,079
Fire a shot so we see you!

468
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,719
There they are, Holt.
- I see 'em, Verne.

469
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,599
Hey boys.

470
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,399
- And he was up
on top of the bus,

471
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:15,959
he fell right down in the water!

472
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,479
- Not a damn thing
funny about that.

473
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,980
- Holt.
- What?

474
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,981
Let's go.

475
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,559
- There's a
waterfall right over here.

476
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,599
- I know where the hell
the waterfall is at, Verne.

477
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,381
- What we do is we go
through that gully.

478
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,599
- No, we're going up
top where we can see.

479
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,679
- No, we gotta go to the
bottom of the waterfall,

480
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,519
he said cut 'em off at the
waterfall and he's awful mad,

481
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,519
didn't you see what
he done to that girl?

482
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,719
I'm going down this way, I
don't care where you're going.

483
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,023
- I give a damn
where you go either.

484
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:41,102
- You're just pissed because
of the truck, I know you.

485
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,759
Verne!

486
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,422
Yeah!

487
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:15,424
- You bitches, I'm
gonna kill you!

488
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,064
Hey, hey, um!

489
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,639
- No, no, sounded like
many shots from that rifle.

490
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,879
What do we do now?

491
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,181
Pray.

492
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,759
Don't shoot!

493
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:59,559
Over there!

494
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,919
Over there.

495
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:03,507
They got Verne, they hung him.

496
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,347
Come on!

497
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,879
Come on!

498
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,359
Those bitches wanted a war?

499
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,959
We'll give 'em a God damn war.

500
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,979
Where were ya when
we needed you?

501
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:38,181
Wasn't doing me any
damn good, was it?

502
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,239
Get up, bitch.

503
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,144
Mr. Collins, wait.

504
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,864
Why don't you leave 'em for us?

505
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,039
Yes sir.

506
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,308
Keep 'em, they're bait.

507
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,146
Hey, hey!

508
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,559
- Hey, don't
let 'em get away!

509
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,559
Come on, what's wrong with ya?

510
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,864
Get her!

511
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,141
Hey!

512
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,799
- Come on, Holt, get
her, come on now!

513
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,300
Yeah!

514
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,879
Come on, Holt, get her, boy!

515
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,879
Come on, Holt, get
it in there now!

516
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,179
Oh my God, Babe!

517
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,879
Watch over Mickey,
I'll have to go back.

518
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:37,519
You can't go alone, Babe!

519
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,061
- You guys get
down and stay down!

520
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:52,106
- Yee-ha, come on,
Holt, ride her, buddy!

521
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,947
Come on, baby, come on!

522
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:07,026
Yeah, yeah, come on, Holt,
come on, Holt, come on, Holt!

523
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,999
Come on, let's go.

524
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:58,599
- Babe, we can't stop,
we gotta keep moving.

525
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,222
- You can bleed to
death, we gotta stop.

526
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,348
Come on, just a bit
farther, right here.

527
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,149
You'll be okay.

528
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,062
- No, no we won't.
- Go.

529
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,261
Wait.

530
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,519
- She didn't deserve this,
she didn't deserve this!

531
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,619
Son of a bitch!

532
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,021
Come on!

533
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,309
- Stoney!
- Louise!

534
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,101
Let's go!

535
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,739
Louise is dead.

536
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,839
Babe, why is this happening?

537
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:09,668
- I don't know, let's go, let's
just go, come on, let's go!

538
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,839
Babe, stop it!

539
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,319
We gotta rest a second.

540
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:27,626
- We can't, I'm not gonna
die and neither are you.

541
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:31,507
If those bastards want us they're
gonna have to come get us.

542
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,909
I hear 'em coming.

543
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:42,029
God damn, what the fuck?

544
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,559
What happened?

545
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,703
We were ambushed.

546
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,639
- Who did this,
Holt, who did it?

547
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,261
God Damn bitches that's who!

548
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:01,745
Went that way!

549
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,906
- We ain't playing this time,
fucking shoot 'em on sight.

550
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:34,199
What the hell?

551
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:35,865
Did they get him Holt?

552
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,739
Those bitches did!

553
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,388
They won't get away
from me this time.

554
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,541
Come on!

555
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,479
Gotcha.

556
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,980
Shit!

557
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,068
Please don't kill me.

558
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:29,705
I'm the only one left, you
already got all my friends.

559
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,519
I'll tell Mr. Collins
that you're dead

560
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,026
or that you all got away.

561
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,025
- Babe?
- Mickey!

562
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,987
- Drop your weapons
or I'll bust her neck!

563
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,279
I mean it!

564
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,679
Don't hurt her.

565
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,903
Drop 'em, drop 'em!

566
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,943
Step back, all of you!

567
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,187
Put your hands on your head.

568
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:30,706
Oh my God.

569
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:46,904
I think we made it.

570
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:49,479
This is Flint Ridge?

571
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,542
I don't know.

572
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,839
There's nobody here.

573
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,380
There's nobody here!

574
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:12,821
This can't be Flint Ridge.

575
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:23,999
Babe, I can't go on.

576
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,719
I can't do this anymore.

577
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,783
- It's safe in here,
bring her here.

578
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,119
- Listen, we've
gotta get some help.

579
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,439
I want Donna off her feet

580
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,879
and I want you girls
to get some rest.

581
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,070
I'm gonna go take a look
around, I won't be gone long.

582
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,830
Be careful, sis.

583
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,146
Be careful.

584
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,300
Flint Ridge.

585
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,187
No.

586
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:09,066
- I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!

587
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,466
Bitch, I'm gonna kill you.

588
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,660
You won't get away bimbo.

589
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,701
Babe!

590
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,981
Oh Babe!

591
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,500
Babe!

592
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,547
Babe!

593
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,261
Babe!

594
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,421
Babe,Babe!

595
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,660
Babe!

596
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,626
Thank God.
