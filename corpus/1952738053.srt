1
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:15,968
Shakespeare said,
"Life was full of sound and fury,

2
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,554
"and in the end, signified nothing."

3
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,684
Okay, let's begin with Helena.

4
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,150
-Cristal Delgiorno?
-Come in, my darling.

5
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,985
I'm Helena Shepridge.

6
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,195
-Ain't you beautiful?
-Thank you.

7
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,322
Gabriella told me you wanted a reading.

8
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,117
She said you know the future.

9
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,871
I adore Gabriella.
She's such a gifted masseuse.

10
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:46,707
I must say, I've become addicted
to those massages.

11
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,835
They're the only thing that
relieves the throbbing in my neck.

12
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,713
Will it be cash or check, darling?
Gabriella told you the fee?

13
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:56,675
Believe me, it's far less expensive.
These fancy psychiatrists I've been seeing...

14
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,219
-Have a little seat, then. Make yourself comfy.
-Thank you.

15
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,514
They sit there all stony-faced
when you need help.

16
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,810
These horrible, horrible medications,
they make me feel even more fidgety.

17
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,939
Is there something I could sip on?

18
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,525
Do you want a cup of tea?

19
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,861
Have you any sherry?

20
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,530
A little drinky. Scotch?

21
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,407
Even better.

22
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,703
I want to tell you something, darling.

23
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,581
My first impression of you

24
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,545


is a woman
who is constantly blaming herself.

25
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,713
Am I right?

26
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,635
You're being too hard on yourself,
my darling.

27
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,055
Thank you.

28
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,685
Well, you're very perceptive.

29
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:54,233
When my husband walked out on me,
I tried ending my life.

30
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,860
Well, I imagine Gabriella told you
that little tale.

31
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,446
She's such a gossip.

32
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,324
I now realize that was foolish.

33
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,910
I have everything to live for. I do, don't I?

34
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,829
I mean, is that what you see?

35
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,957
I mean, do you see...

36
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,167
Is my future hopeful?

37
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,585
Shall I tell you something?

38
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,298
I wish you were sitting here with me
because all I am seeing

39
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:23,720
is huge, cosmic waves
moving towards you, of positive energy.

40
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,808
You're bathed in a rose light, my darling.

41
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,853
You've got nothing but good coming to you,
I promise you.

42
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:38,277
Well, 40 years of marriage is a long time.
One becomes terribly dependent.

43
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,822
My husband walked out on me
for one simple reason,

44
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,949
I was too honest with him.

45
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,868
I refused to allow him to delude himself.

46
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,415
Meet Helena's ex-husband, Alfie Shepridge.

47
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:56,670
He woke in the middle of the night,
pictured eternity, lay there in a cold sweat,

48
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,840
and has not been able
to get back to sleep since.

49
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,926
Suddenly, it became
all jogging and health foods.

50
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,304
And give me one more set of 1 2.

51
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,308
-I can't, I've had enough.
-One, two...

52
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,268
-Alfie, you're doing too much.
-...three, four...

53
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,477
-You'll kill your back again.
-...five...

54
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,354
-He thinks he's 21 !
-...six.

55
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,398
Those days are over.
You're not a young man anymore.

56
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,482
Jesus.

57
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,067
You do push-ups,

58
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,194
but the clock still ticks. You can't fight time.

59
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,655
You see?
She already has me dead and buried.

60
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,991
But there's longevity in my genes,
and that's what counts.

61
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,451
Genes, right?

62
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,037
Poor Helena.

63
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,831
She didn't understand
that truth is not beauty,

64
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,751
as the poet said, but quite the opposite.

65
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,877
Alfie dumped her.

66
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,756
He bought a sports car.
He took a flashy bachelor pad.

67
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,759
Had his teeth whitened
and his skin darkened.

68
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,183
And Helena? She took it like a trouper.

69
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,853
She had a nervous breakdown
and popped 40 sleeping pills.

70
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:59,149
She has become the official burden
of her only child, Sally.

71
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,943
Sally, who married Roy.

72
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,363
My daughter married badly.

73
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,865
Waste of education.

74
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,118
He graduated from medical school
to give it all up to become a writer.

75
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:15,374
He's had one successful novel
and since then, he's failed over and over!

76
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,044
He's a one-book phenomenon.
He can't accept that! Am I right?

77
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:23,048
I mean, do you see a future for him,
or was he just lucky the first time around?

78
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,134
I want you to bring me something of his,
something that he's had close to him,

79
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,972
like a scarf or a glove
or a T-shirt, all right, darling?

80
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,891
I pay their bills!

81
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,227
Sally can't survive on what she earns.

82
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,646
He doesn't work
so he can stay at home and write.

83
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,440
He's been working on
the same bloody novel for years.

84
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:44,152
It's not entirely true,
what Helena tells her swami.

85
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,738
Roy tried a while ago to earn money.

86
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,949
It's not that he didn't try.

87
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,576
He just wasn't much of a chauffeur.

88
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,289
I've had it with that goddamned job.

89
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,417
-What?
-That's it, I quit!

90
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:01,253
Please, Roy, not this conversation again!

91
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,713
What are you doing home, anyway?

92
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,257
What happened?

93
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,342
I had an accident today.
I smashed up the car.

94
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,510
What?

95
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:12,180
I can't write all night
and then drive in the daytime!

96
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,141
-I fell asleep at the wheel.
-Oh, God.

97
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,601
Well, are you okay? Did anyone get hurt?

98
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,604
Look, I need time to work on my book.

99
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,775
When are you gonna
finish that book, anyway?

100
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,947
I mean, how many times can you write
and tear up and rewrite these chapters?

101
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,700
-It's like you're scared to finish.
-Okay, you know what? You're right.

102
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,993
I'm gun-shy.

103
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,120
I can't handle it if it's confirmed, yet again,

104
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,414
that all those nice things predicted about me
were wrong.

105
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,040
That I was a flash in the pan.

106
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,543
-Stalling is not the answer.
-Yeah.

107
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,753
Jesus Christ.

108
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,131
You know, all my friends have families.

109
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,383
And what are we doing here?

110
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,804
One way or the other,
I want to move on with our lives.

111
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,158
Roy's attention was caught
by a lovely apparition

112
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,119
moving into the flat across the way.

113
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,872
He and Sally fought so much now,

114
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:23,460
it was hard to imagine that
they fell so much in love when they first met.

115
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,961
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine,

116
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,755
but he came straight out in front of me.

117
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,132
-It looks so painful.
-It's killing me.

118
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,426
-It's swollen all there.
-Yeah.

119
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,429
If you can move it, it's not broken.

120
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,268
My guess is that you strained the metatarsal.

121
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,980
-Are you a doctor?
-Unlicensed.

122
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,941
May I?

123
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,450
-Her foot's okay?
-Oh, yeah, it's better than okay.

124
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,996
It's very pretty.

125
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,252
"So much depends

126
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,462
"upon a red wheelbarrow

127
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,218
"glazed with rain water

128
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,637
"beside the white chickens."

129
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,308
And Sally's ass.

130
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,398
I'm paraphrasing, of course.

131
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,573
You know, the day I graduated
from medical school was the day

132
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,827
that I knew that
I would never practice medicine.

133
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,996
There was no question in my mind

134
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,373
that I was gonna write,
and that I was gonna make it as a writer.

135
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,500
I mean, you know how you feel those things?

136
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,752
And Roy's first book did make it.

137
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,213
At least it showed real promise.

138
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,298
But that was then.

139
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,468
And as the years passed,
Sally put her dreams on hold

140
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,845
and went to work.

141
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,557
Now, the hours are 24/7.

142
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,061
The work involves everything from,
I don't know,

143
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:09,107
filing papers to keeping clients happy
and painters pampered,

144
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,735
to getting my lunches.

145
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,446
So, what are your ambitions?

146
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:20,327
Well, I've got a degree in art
and a background in art history,

147
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,205
and I've worked for the museum
and some photographers.

148
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,458
How did you hear about this job?

149
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,627
My friend, Jane Brooks,
who works at The Geller Gallery,

150
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,128
she told me you were looking for someone.

151
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,381
And when she said
it was The Clemente Gallery...

152
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,847
Well, you're going to school with the best.

153
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:44,559
I've been working at The Geller Gallery
for four years now,

154
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:50,482
and I've really had an education,
even though I can't stand Lois Geller.

155
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,234
Well, Greg's a dynamo.

156
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,446
And I must say, extremely attractive.

157
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,824
Sally, don't get a crush on your boss.

158
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,410
That way lies total madness.

159
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:09,042
Roy was asked by Henry Strangler
to read his first novel and give an opinion.

160
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,671
And Strangler's first novel seemed
so much better than Roy's fourth,

161
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,506
he grew discouraged.

162
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,219
All that cheered him up was
the beautiful creature in red across the way,

163
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:23,223
whose life grew increasingly tantalizing
behind her windowpane.

164
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,255
-I'm sorry. Am I disturbing you?
-No, not at all.

165
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,549
I love the guitar.

166
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,469
-Recently moved in?
-Just for the summer.

167
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,222
-Should I close this window?
-No, I'm not working.

168
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,933
I'm just reading a friend's new book.

169
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,480
It reads beautiful to Boccherini.

170
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,774
Do you know his music?

171
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,235
Quite impressed.

172
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,031
Well, anyway, if it gets too annoying,
just let me know and I'll stop, okay?

173
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,579
-Anyone want a top-up?
-I would.

174
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,800
Hey.

175
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,052
-I read your new book.
-What?

176
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,181
-I was overwhelmed.
-No.

177
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,350
-No, you're kidding.
-Yes. My confidence is gone now.

178
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,645
-What? Don't be ridiculous.
-Yeah.

179
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,314
I'm speechless.

180
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,233
You liked it?

181
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,568
Damn!

182
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,112
Obviously, you know,
I haven't shown it to anybody before.

183
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,198
But I need to tweak a few things,
still, of course...

184
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,951
Of course it didn't hurt that I read it
to some very beautiful Boccherini,

185
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,413
played on the guitar by that knockout,
whose name I still don't know.

186
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,666
-The woman in the window?
-Yes, the woman in the window.

187
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,753
Well, no wonder you're having trouble
finishing your bloody book.

188
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,006
-I finished it.
-No.

189
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,341
-I handed it in yesterday.
-Well done.

190
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,009
No, I'm a nervous wreck.

191
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,094
I don't know what I'll do if it doesn't make it.

192
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,222
-Come on.
-No, I don't know what I'll do.

193
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,641
I'll be chauffeuring
the goddamned limos again...

194
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,226
-Rubbish!
-All my confidence is gone.

195
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,479
Because of you, partially,
my confidence is gone.

196
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,586
Hello?

197
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,672
Hi, Mum. Come in.

198
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,007
Why does she have to
come over here so often?

199
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,760
I mean, it's once, twice. It's endless!

200
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,138
I'm trying to relax here.
My nerves are shot from waiting.

201
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,724
I know. She can't stand to be alone.

202
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,477
And, you know, I worry about her, Roy.

203
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,689
She's taken to talking to herself a bit, lately.

204
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,774
And you encourage her
with that phony mind-reader.

205
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,234
Well, okay, yes!

206
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,362
Cristal is a fake. We know that, but...

207
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,907
Thank God she buys into it,
and it gives her peace of mind,

208
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,326
and don't you try and spoil it for her, please.

209
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,744
Okay, look, I'm not gonna say anything.

210
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,748
I just don't think you help her by going
into that garbage about foretelling her future.

211
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,417
She needs medicine, not illusions.

212
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,795
No, not if the illusions
work better than the medicine.

213
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,466
-Here I am, darling.
-Hi, Mum!

214
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:50,138
I've just come from a session with Cristal.
That woman is uncanny.

215
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,058
I know you have
a cold, scientific background, Roy.

216
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,353
-Yes, I have a tough time with mumbo-jumbo.
-Roy, please!

217
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,063
Look, if you feel better, then it's just...
I don't know.

218
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,899
We discussed you.

219
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,692
She was very positive about your future.

220
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,403
Though, to be perfectly candid,
she didn't see it in literature.

221
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,571
Well, that's too bad.

222
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,489
Let's hope she's channeling
the wrong spirits.

223
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,616
She's rarely wrong.

224
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,118
Mum, Roy just handed in
his new novel this week.

225
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,579
He's on tenterhooks while they read it.

226
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,956
Well, I'm only saying
not to build your hopes up.

227
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,334
-Cristal said...
-No, I don't care what Cristal said. Okay?

228
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,253
Mum, nobody's infallible! Please! Let it...

229
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,465
I know she's always right with your future,
but it doesn't mean she knows Roy's.

230
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,383
She's never even met him!

231
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,470
She was very complimentary
in her readings about Roy,

232
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,932
just not necessarily as a writer.
Not at this point in time.

233
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,310
She did say one day,
perhaps, with maturity...

234
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,688
Oh, by the way,
could I have another glove of yours?

235
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,399
I'm sorry, but she lost the first one.

236
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,859
What glove?

237
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,529
Did you give her my missing glove? Jesus!

238
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,994
Did he take the book home with him?

239
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,416
But no clue whether he could
get to it this weekend?

240
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,378
Okay. No, I'll call back.

241
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:37,328
Okay, now let's go back
and take a look at Alfie Shepridge.

242
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,579
Since his divorce,

243
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,499
Alfie Shepridge did not exactly find himself

244
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,253
leading the thirtysomething life
he envisioned in his new digs.

245
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:57,807
Friends fixed him up with one or two women
they thought might be appropriate.

246
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,559
Always that word...

247
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,102
But it was not what he had in mind.

248
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:05,231
I'm sorry about the stick,
but I've just had my hip replaced.

249
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,568
At first, I thought I fell down and broke it.

250
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,403
But what actually happened was,

251
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,114
it broke, and then I fell down.

252
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,366
Do you see the difference?

253
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,828
He tried spending time
with younger colleagues from his firm,

254
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:22,123
but he felt even more out of place
and ridiculous.

255
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,840
And then, one day, after months
of loneliness and awkward experiences,

256
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,469
he took his daughter for a walk
and made a startling announcement.

257
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,764
I've met a woman, I'm very much in love,
I'm going to get married.

258
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,433
-Isn't that fabulous?
-You're kidding.

259
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,310
No. You seem shocked.

260
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,772
Is that what this walk's about?

261
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,565
So private and mysterious.

262
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,234
Well, I told your mother
and, you know, she was surprised,

263
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,278
but she took it well.

264
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:56,783
Apparently, this woman she's been seeing,
who gives her guidance about her future,

265
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,202
has given her a lot of strength emotionally.

266
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,747
Anyway, I would like you to
help choose some perfume with me.

267
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,165
Would you do that?

268
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,335
So, who is this woman
you're going to marry?

269
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,130
Her name is Charmaine.

270
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,800
She's an actress! Half his age!

271
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,885
This is all for the good.

272
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:21,099
I've got a strong feeling that
this is a positive turning point in your life.

273
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:25,770
But where is my life heading?
I need direction.

274
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:31,901
-Is my future as empty as I feel it is?
-Listen. This is a pivotal moment.

275
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,904
Now, you've got several paths
to choose from.

276
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,115
You've got to make sure
you choose the right one.

277
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,701
My darling! I'm seeing you triumphing.

278
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,122
I'm seeing you with a new love.

279
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:48,126
-What, a new love for me?
-I can see it! I can see it!

280
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,797
This development in your husband's life
can only be favorable to you.

281
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,299
You're saying I shall meet a new love?

282
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,343
And I'll tell you something else.

283
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:01,681
Your husband will never love
this woman he's marrying

284
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,766
as much as he loved you.

285
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,603
I've kept all his letters. They were so adoring.

286
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:11,399
Christ, no one wants to get old!
I don't want to get old!

287
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,901
And you're saying I won't be alone?

288
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,904
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life alone.

289
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,656
Oh, my sweetheart.

290
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,535
You are entering a period of great fulfillment.

291
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,708
I'm seeing a handsome stranger
coming into your life.

292
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,628
Powerful attraction.

293
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,256
You're like two magnets.

294
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:47,351
Sally, can you call Lucien Moss
and get me out of my lunch tomorrow?

295
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,187
-Reschedule?
-Well, yes.

296
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,689
-Tell him I'll call to reschedule, yeah.
-Okay.

297
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:56,402
And arrange a flight to Venice
for my wife and myself for the 25th.

298
00:19:56,486 --> 00:20:00,239
Which reminds me,
I need you to come with me this afternoon.

299
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,710
Yes, they're lovely.
I particularly like that one.

300
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:16,631
Sally, could you please come?
Take a look at this.

301
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,508
-Which ones are you thinking of?
-These diamonds.

302
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,887
Or the pearls.

303
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,266
-Well, they're both beautiful.
-They are.

304
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:31,103
Now, what's the best price
you'll give me on these?

305
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:35,483
Well, these are Victorian diamonds.
Brilliant cut.

306
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,569
These are $50,000.

307
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,739
These are what we call natural pearls.

308
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,617
These are slightly later,
Edwardian, turn-of-the-century,

309
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,285
and these are $1 5,000.

310
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,082
Which would my wife prefer?

311
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,709
What's she like?

312
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,505
-Remote.
-Remote?

313
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:03,678
She loves diamonds, but, you know,
these pearls are so sexy.

314
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,555
And so much less expensive.

315
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,269
-Would you like to try them on?
-They're not for me.

316
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:16,315
I understand, but perhaps it might help,
if the gentleman could see how they looked.

317
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,859
-Shall I?
-If you don't mind.

318
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,486
All right.

319
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,115
-Let's see.
-Let's see.

320
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,081
-Very nice.
-Yeah.

321
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,626
Yep, yep, yep.

322
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,379
Wow. Wow!

323
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,381
Let me see.

324
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,969
-They really frame your face beautifully.
-They do, sir.

325
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:48,639
Well, I do have a good shape
for long earrings.

326
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,224
You do.

327
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,770
Well, you love these more than the pearls,
don't you?

328
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,315
-I do. I'm afraid so.
-Okay, God.

329
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,360
I hope, for this kind of money,
she looks as good in them as you do.

330
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,528
Yep.

331
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,409
-Do I have to take them off?
-That's life, I'm afraid.

332
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,453
-Sorry.
-Oh, well.

333
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,664
They were good for a minute.

334
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,460
Oh, I'm dying to see just what
my father thinks is so perfect for him.

335
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,671
-Can you tell I'm a little skeptical?
-Yeah. Why?

336
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,466
I mean, who is she?
How long has he known her to marry her?

337
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:27,178
And why is some young actress
rushing off to marry him?

338
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,931
An actress. Actress in what?

339
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,143
-What's her name?
-Charmaine.

340
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,270
I keep wanting to say "chow mein."

341
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,522
Why do you keep looking out the window?

342
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,024
I don't.

343
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,818
You're so nervous. You seem edgy.
What's up?

344
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,571
Well, if I can hear something
about my book...

345
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,867
-Oh, Christ, who's that?
-One guess!

346
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,214
You look very lovely, darling.

347
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,966
Forgive me for barging in.
I've just come from Cristal's.

348
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,678
She had some things to say
about your father's upcoming wedding.

349
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,808
-Is there something I could sip on?
-Helena, you've sipped us dry.

350
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:18,020
Unless you're willing to try cooking sherry.
I'm just joking.

351
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:21,315
By the way, she said you would hear
about your book any day now,

352
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,318
but not to be upset
if the verdict was negative.

353
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,406
I hope Cristal put your mind at ease
about Dad's remarrying.

354
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,573
Cristal said...

355
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:34,120
She said he would never be as enchanted
with this other woman as he was with me.

356
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,622
Well, I'm sure she's right.

357
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:41,043
-Have you met her?
-Actually, we're going to meet her tonight.

358
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,672
Dad's taking us to the park
for drinks and a concert.

359
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:50,928
Cristal and I were talking about
a new love that I will soon be meeting.

360
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,681
Wow. That's exciting news. Isn't it, Roy?

361
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,268
Yeah, you will meet a tall, dark stranger.

362
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,604
I will not be alone. I will find love.
I can rest assured.

363
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,899
What does she charge you
for this message of hope?

364
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,319
It's not hope, it's a certainty.
Cristal predicts it.

365
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,448
-He doesn't believe, Sally.
-No, I believe, unfortunately,

366
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:14,827
that you will meet the same tall, dark stranger
that we all eventually meet.

367
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,621
And look where that cynicism has got you
over the years.

368
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,582
Cristal knows things
she couldn't possibly know

369
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:20,749
if she wasn't blessed with a gift.

370
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,251
Look, did it ever occur to you

371
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:24,962
that she might be getting her information
from your masseuse?

372
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,173
I mean, not to mention
what you give away without realizing it...

373
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,466
-Roy!
-What?

374
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,469
She tells her what she wants to hear
and takes her money.

375
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,095
Well, you take my money

376
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,930
and certainly don't tell me
what I want to hear.

377
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,267
Why can you two not be together
without tension?

378
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,895
I'm just trying to prepare
your husband for a blow

379
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,438
should his work be rejected.

380
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,815
Well, my work will not be rejected.

381
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,153
And if it is, this hustler you see
made a 50-50 guess.

382
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,155
You see how that works?

383
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,781
Mum?

384
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,410
Please, just give him a break.
He's vulnerable right now.

385
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,705
Hasn't a spiritual bone in his body.
How can he write books?

386
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,833
So, Cristal said you're gonna meet someone.

387
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,419
Isn't that good news?

388
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:09,006
She also said that
you're perfectly able to conceive.

389
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,842
Well, of course I am, and you know that, too.

390
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:15,721
Well, I couldn't after your brother died.

391
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,891
I mean, the doctor said
it was psychological, but...

392
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,685
I couldn't give Alfie another child,
and he longed for a son.

393
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,688
Please, let's not relive everything constantly.

394
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,774
Anyway, look, we must go.

395
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,966
There they are.

396
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,717
Hello.

397
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,886
-This is Sally and this is Roy.
-Hello. All right?

398
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,638
-Hey, how are you?
-Charmaine Foxx.

399
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,806
-From America.
-Yeah.

400
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,891
You didn't tell me. Never tells me nothing.

401
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,184
Hello.

402
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,855
Don't want to flash everyone now. No.

403
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,858
-Well.
-So...

404
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,789
Dad said you were an actress.

405
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,958
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

406
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:31,130
I tried it in Hollywood for a while,
but if you don't know people, it...

407
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,508
It's like a vicious circle, you know?

408
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,468
Yeah.

409
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,763
So, what are your plans?

410
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,098
I think...

411
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,602
Well, her plans are, you know,
to be my wife, Mrs. Alfie Shepridge.

412
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,146
She's going to be the mother of my son.
The boy...

413
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,733
One day I'll teach him football,
or something like that. Isn't that right?

414
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,528
Anyway, she... You were in...

415
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:58,282
-She was in a few movies, films, on TV.
-Stop it.

416
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,576
-But you were.
-Just small parts.

417
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,287
-What were the films?
-Science fiction.

418
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,834
I was the leader's daughter,
but from another galaxy.

419
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,879
That's right up your street, Roy.
Roy is a doctor.

420
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:15,591
Well, actually, he wrote a novel
about a physicist,

421
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,093
-based on Werner Heisenberg, isn't it?
-Yeah.

422
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,845
Who?

423
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,807
So, how long have you known each other?

424
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,142
-Three months. No...
-No.

425
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,436
-Two months.
-Two months. Yeah.

426
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,774
So, you've actually just met.

427
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,693
Well, we've spent every day together
since we did meet.

428
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,195
-And can you blame me?
-We have. Yeah.

429
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:40,699
I mean, I was besotted with
charming Charmaine from the very first day

430
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,452
and it just, you know...

431
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,578
So that's...

432
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,913
So, how did you meet?

433
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,375
A mutual acquaintance introduced us.
That's how we met.

434
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,584
Yeah.

435
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,504
Here, Alfie was not being truthful.

436
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,924
Technically, maybe,
but that wasn't the whole story.

437
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,511
-Hello.
-Come in.

438
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,974
So, you're Charmiane.

439
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,227
-Charmaine.
-Charmiane.

440
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:12,272
Sorry. Come in.
Yeah, he said you were very pretty.

441
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,694
-My body's how I make my living, isn't it?
-Yes.

442
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,405
-I'm always working out.
-Good. Well, me, too.

443
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,448
Look, feel this.

444
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,745
-Not bad.
-You're buff, ain't you?

445
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,580
Yeah.

446
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,250
-Would you like a drink?
-Yeah. All right.

447
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,043
Good. Okay.

448
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,423
Geoffrey Sweeney gave me your number.

449
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,216
-Geoffrey?
-Yeah.

450
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,510
-Geoffrey...
-Yes.

451
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:45,764
-God, I know millions of Geoffreys.
-Oh, yeah? Well, doesn't matter.

452
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,642
You have to forgive me
if I seem a little awkward,

453
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,812
-but I don't usually do this sort of thing.
-Right.

454
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:56,275
I assume it's hygienic and all,
you know what I mean?

455
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,318
-Hygienic?
-Yeah.

456
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,781
-Are you having a laugh?
-No, I'm just checking.

457
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,159
I won't give you AIDS,
if that's what you mean.

458
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,203
No, I wasn't thinking about AIDS. God, no.

459
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,080
There's a man in my firm who's got herpes.

460
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,208
-No, relax, don't have to worry.
-All right. Yeah.

461
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:17,671
Basically, I'm an actress.
I'm just doing this part-time.

462
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,842
Good. You look pretty. Okay.

463
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,263
-Shall we settle the business?
-Oh, yeah. Okay.

464
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,266
-They told you it was 350, yeah?
-Yeah, okay.

465
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,352
Here's 500, and you can keep the change.
All right?

466
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,605
Oh, thank you.

467
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:37,733
I mean, you know,
I wasn't thinking about AIDS.

468
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,364
Oi.

469
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,742
-Shall we get on with it?
-What?

470
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,745
-Do you want to get on with it?
-Yeah.

471
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,538
Okay.

472
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:01,465
-Forty years is a long time to be married.
-Yeah, it's almost half a century.

473
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:05,469
What happened is that my wife, Helena,
she allowed herself to become old,

474
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,012
and I wasn't prepared
to accept that nonsense.

475
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,472
-No.
-Because you're as old as,

476
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,682
-or as young as you feel.
-Oh, definitely.

477
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,893
And I'm not prepared for the graveyard
or the scrap yard yet.

478
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,646
-Do you need any help?
-No.

479
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,648
I find older guys very sexy.

480
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,484
Well, we're experienced, and...

481
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,903
You know, we're not scrambling around
to make careers for ourselves

482
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,988
-and all that nonsense, and...
-Oh, yeah.

483
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,784
You know, we like to make a woman
feel appreciated and all the rest of it and...

484
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:32,246
You had a good time just now, didn't you,
when we were, you know, in bed?

485
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,915
-You heard me screaming.
-Yes.

486
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,835
Could I see you again, do you think,
charming Charmaine?

487
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,004
Yeah. I'll give you...

488
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,840
I'll give you a number.
You can get me directly.

489
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,258
-Okay.
-Oh, what is it?

490
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,845
So one tumble with this pro,
and the poor guy's in love.

491
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,180
He starts buying all her time.

492
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:54,393
And every time she screws him, he falls
deeper and deeper for the little mechanic.

493
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:58,272
Tell me, would you ever consider
letting me change your life?

494
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,899
What's wrong with my life?

495
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:06,113
Well, I'm talking about marriage.
I don't mean the sort of marriage you had...

496
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:10,868
Because at 1 6, what would you know
about love or living, or anything?

497
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,412
What do you think?

498
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,665
-Marriage?
-Yeah. Well, why not?

499
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,543
You know, you told me yourself,
every time you go out on a call

500
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:23,714
you're taking your life in your own hands,
and I'm gonna be around a long time.

501
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,717
You know, there's longevity in my genes.

502
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,927
Go on, hit me there. Go on.

503
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,890
That cheap tart is what he left my mother for.

504
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,600
Actress, my foot.

505
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,060
The only acting she's ever done
is faking an orgasm.

506
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,729
Leave him alone.

507
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,064
You know, I never saw the guy so happy,
and who can blame him?

508
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,609
-She's a hot little number.
-Yeah.

509
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:47,070
I bet you'd like to make love to Chow Mein.

510
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,698
All I'm saying is live and let live.

511
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,327
He couldn't keep his hands off her.

512
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,496
I found that whole public display
completely disgusting.

513
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,916
-And did you see the ring he got her?
-Yeah.

514
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,084
I'm telling you,
she'll take him for everything he's worth,

515
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,838
and then leave him pouring his heart out
to some barman.

516
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,966
No, he's a big boy.
She'll put a charge in his battery.

517
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,094
Maybe she'll give him
that son he always wanted.

518
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:16,016
How infuriating will it be if he has
his second family before I have my first.

519
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,143
Okay, okay.

520
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,813
You know, you looked really pretty tonight?

521
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,274
Are those earrings new?

522
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,484
-These?
-Yeah.

523
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,444
I wear them every day.

524
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,822
They're just cheap junk.

525
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,666
You always know how to hit on me
when I'm upset, don't you?

526
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:46,880
I really don't want to keep doing this
if we have to use contraception.

527
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,770
To occupy her time and keep Helena active,

528
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:06,358
Alfie persuaded Peter and Enid Wicklow,
longtime friends of the family,

529
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:10,153
to hire her as a personal shopper
to supervise their wardrobe.

530
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,363
Enid.

531
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,240
I need your help.

532
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,993
I thought this for
when you go to your weekend house.

533
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,786
Yes. Enid, I need your input.

534
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,581
I admit, it's quite pretty, but... Bold.

535
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,669
The question is, do I have
the courage of your convictions?

536
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:29,339
-Enid, is this okay?
-Yes, I love it. It's great.

537
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,927
Helena, this is Peter's uncle, Jonathan.

538
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,221
-Hello, nice to meet you.
-Hello.

539
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,974
Peter, it looks really smart.
You should heed this woman.

540
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:42,102
She'll have you looking
like a country squire in no time.

541
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,772
My flair has always been fashion.

542
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:52,154
I had a promising career as
a costume designer in the theater.

543
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,488
But when I met my husband,

544
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,284
he didn't like me going away on tour
and leaving him alone.

545
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,704
I can understand feeling possessive
towards a loved one.

546
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,123
I never wanted Claire to work.

547
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,043
-Thank you for coming by, Jonathan.
-Oh, thank you for lunch.

548
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,210
I'm sorry I've got to go,

549
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,378
-but I'll see you on Sunday.
-Yes.

550
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,964
And you keep on after him.

551
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,051
He's looking more dapper
than I've seen him look in years.

552
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,928
You have a flair for the dramatic.

553
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,346
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

554
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,808
-What a charming man.
-Yes.

555
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,810
Poor Jonathan, his wife died recently

556
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,271
and he's been trying so desperately
to contact her.

557
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:29,024
-Contact her?
-He owns an occult book shop.

558
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,610
He's very devout, in a New Age way.

559
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,613
Yes, this is Roy Channing.

560
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:38,658
I wanted to find out the status of the book
I left with Malcolm Dodds.

561
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,413
Really? How long?

562
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,542
When will he be back in the country?

563
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,589
If he calls in, can you let him know I phoned?

564
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,966
I mean, not to push him, just to see?

565
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,552
All right.

566
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:15,195
Hello!

567
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,123
-Was I too loud again?
-No. You want to have lunch?

568
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,041
-Lunch?
-Yeah.

569
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,504
I don't know.
The weather's really bad, don't you think?

570
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:37,050
Look, I'm going downstairs for lunch.
I'll bring an umbrella.

571
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,807
I just have some more work.
I need half an hour more.

572
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,601
There's a great little place
right around the corner.

573
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,896
Okay. Hey, why not?
Can you give me half an hour, though?

574
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:53,692
I'll walk around the block
and meet you in front of your house at 1 2:30.

575
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:56,153
-All right?
-Perfect. See you then. Bye.

576
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,883
-I'm Roy Channing.
-Hi, I'm Dia.

577
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,301
-Dia?
-Dia.

578
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,677
How exotic. I got it, I got it.

579
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,929
-Sure?
-Yeah. I got it.

580
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,098
Come on, it's right around the corner.

581
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:38,528
-So you're a professional musician?
-Oh, no. No.

582
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,324
I'm just getting my PhD in musicology.

583
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,451
I play a few instruments, though.

584
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,828
Not too well.

585
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,206
Are you sure it doesn't bother you
when you're writing?

586
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,167
You know I write.

587
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,878
You know, I can see you, too.

588
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,965
No, you don't bother me. You inspire me.

589
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,052
Perfect. I've always wanted to be
someone's muse.

590
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,640
I'll dedicate my next book
to the woman who's always in red.

591
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,100
Thank you.

592
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:13,188
You know, my father's a writer.
He does a lot of translations.

593
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,316
Yeah, mostly Eastern European authors.

594
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,984
Wow.

595
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,280
Can I make a terrible confession,
even though I hardly know you?

596
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,366
Yeah, sure.

597
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,495
Before I heard you play the guitar,

598
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:31,581
I noticed you, one night,
just before I went to bed,

599
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:36,253
and you were slipping out of a red dress,

600
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:41,007
and I thought it was the most erotic
1 5 seconds I'd ever seen.

601
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,844
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

602
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:49,891
Okay, that's flattering, I guess.

603
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,437
A nice-looking man came in

604
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:58,108
and he put his arms around you,
and he turned you to him, and he kissed you.

605
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,318
And with his free hand,
he snapped out the lights,

606
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:05,031
and I thought, whoever this guy is,
he's very, very lucky.

607
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,036
That's Alan, my fiance.

608
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,249
Thank you.

609
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,171
He doesn't seem to live there?

610
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:24,134
You've been watching me for a while,
haven't you?

611
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,845
Yeah, no, you're right, though.
He doesn't live there.

612
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:30,348
He works in Brussels, for the Foreign Office,

613
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,475
so he's over only when he's in town.

614
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,064
-Bon appetit.
-Bon appetit to you, too. Thank you.

615
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,819
So I began the novel, it took, like, two years.

616
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,322
Some days I love it,
and some days I just panic.

617
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,115
-You should show it to my father.
-Yeah?

618
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,158
You should, yeah.

619
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,785
Dad's really sensitive and insightful
when it comes to literature,

620
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,579
and you two would have
so much to talk about.

621
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,832
I'd love to.
Hey, promise me one thing, would you?

622
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:59,544
Two things, actually.
We can have lunch again,

623
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,880
and that you won't suddenly start
pulling your window shades down

624
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,090
when you undress.

625
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,179
-You're very flirtatious, aren't you?
-Am I?

626
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,057
-Anyway, thanks for the lunch, Roy.
-Yeah.

627
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,435
And I'll tell you what.

628
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:19,314
Why don't you look out your window
around midnight?

629
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:24,861
And you stuck at it all these years.
I'm so impressed.

630
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,365
-Don't you just love them?
-I agree. You're right.

631
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,492
They're very interesting.
Congratulations, very good job.

632
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,911
Yeah? Well, thank you. Thanks.
I'm really excited if you like that.

633
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,079
That's great.

634
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,205
We went to school together,

635
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,999
and I always knew
she just showed so much promise.

636
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,877
And Sally was my very first supporter,
when no one else knew what I was on about

637
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,046
with my big, red flowers.
She was the only one that got it.

638
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,341
You know, I really love that one.

639
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,094
-Hello?
-Oh, well, see, your problem was

640
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,596
you never believed in yourself
as much as everyone believed in you.

641
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,223
Yeah, well, I'm clean now.

642
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:57,060
I haven't had a drink or taken drugs in,
like, two years.

643
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,897
Well, Greg will market you brilliantly,
and you are gonna make so much money.

644
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,190
Trust me.

645
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:05,485
I'm so happy for you.
I mean, you work at a top art gallery...

646
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,738
-Oh, please, I get his lunches.
-You're married to a top author.

647
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,783
I mean, we all knew at school
you'd end up being special. We said it.

648
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,535
How is Roy? What's he up to?

649
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:18,748
Well, he's just finished his new novel
and we're having a baby.

650
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,750
-You are?
-I mean, we're planning to have a baby.

651
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:24,129
-I shouldn't be smoking, should I?
-Oh, no. Not yet.

652
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,424
Interesting painter, you know.

653
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:33,138
I mean, we could do a show with her
and Homer Novello and maybe Will Harmon.

654
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:37,183
My long-standing faith in her
has finally been vindicated.

655
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,602
Hey, listen, I don't know if you are interested,

656
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:43,398
but can I offer you two tickets
for Lucia di Lammermoortonight?

657
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,942
I mean, my wife just called
and she cannot go,

658
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:49,946
so I thought maybe you can take the tickets
and go with your husband.

659
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,615
Well, isn't there somebody else
you want to ask before...

660
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,577
Not in such a short notice, actually.

661
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:59,372
Oh, jeez. Well, tonight's Roy's poker night.

662
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,125
Anyway, he's far too antsy
to sit through anything.

663
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,295
Maybe you can find some friends to go with?

664
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,714
You mentioned
how much you liked Donizetti.

665
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,384
I love it. I just never get to go to the opera.
Tickets are way too expensive.

666
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,470
Listen, look.

667
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,929
Take this and...

668
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:19,225
Or, if you don't mind, we could go together.

669
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:24,022
-Yeah...
-Unless you have other plans this evening.

670
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,441
-No, I'm dying to see it...
-Really?

671
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:29,110
-I'd love to go.
-Good. Great.

672
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,445
Okay.

673
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,282
-All right. There you go.
-Thank you.

674
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,450
Okay.

675
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:29,921
Thank you for a wonderful opera
and wonderful Irish coffee.

676
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:34,217
I'm afraid I had too many of them.

677
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:39,389
I hope I didn't get morose
and bore you with my matrimonial agonies.

678
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:43,226
I'll be embarrassed tomorrow
when the whiskey wears off.

679
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,478
No, not at all.

680
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:50,650
In fact, I kind of suspected
from the things you've said.

681
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:59,951
Are you gonna be able to
drive all the way to Maida Vale?

682
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,413
Are you insinuating that
I can't drive while drunk,

683
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,957
just because
I left my contact lenses at home?

684
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,001
Oh, God...

685
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,296
I'll be fine.

686
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,847
Thanks for coming with me tonight.

687
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:26,060
And thanks for keeping your eyes open

688
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:29,689
for new talent for the gallery.

689
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:34,777
And thanks for all the

690
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,741
chocolate truffles.

691
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,760
Well...

692
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,058
-I'll see you tomorrow?
-Yeah.

693
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,000
As the days passed
with no word on his book,

694
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,002
Roy grew more anxious.

695
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:38,257
He looked forward to his afternoons with Dia,
which became longer and more frequent.

696
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,010
-Enough about me.
-Okay, okay...

697
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:44,263
-I have one, but only one.
-All right.

698
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,685
So I'm all set to get married
at the end of the summer,

699
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,855
and sometimes I have these moments
when I feel intense panic

700
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,692
and, I don't know, I just want to call it off.

701
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,194
-Do you love the guy?
-Yes, I do.

702
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,948
I love the guy, but...
I don't know, I just waver.

703
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,408
"Waver"? Why?

704
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:08,663
Now that you and I have been having lunch
and taking these long walks

705
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:11,541
and you shamelessly flirt with me,

706
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,086
and I actually find myself
enjoying the flirtation.

707
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,047
I mean, should I be doing this?

708
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:23,553
I'm so confused. If I'm getting married,
then why am I flirting back?

709
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,847
Are you?

710
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:33,312
I told you I'd take care of you, didn't I?

711
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,606
It's like proper...

712
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,738
-I'm loving this, Alfie. It's so me.
-Good.

713
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,322
-That's the Albert Bridge, there.
-Yeah.

714
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,575
And that's the Tower there.
Harrods is up there.

715
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,077
-And you got me all that silk underwear.
-Yeah.

716
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,871
There you are.

717
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,748
-I told you I'd take care of...
-It cost you so much.

718
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:54,500
Well, what's money? It doesn't matter.

719
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,816
-Alfie?
-Yeah.

720
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,986
-What do you think?
-Wow. That looks amazing.

721
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,197
-You like it?
-Yeah, it's beautiful.

722
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,909
The silk feels so good on my skin.

723
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:31,537
It's a shame they haven't brought the bed,
isn't it? Sorry about that.

724
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,206
-We don't need a bed.
-No?

725
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,958
We could just do it here.

726
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,461
-I've done it on a hardwood floor.
-You have?

727
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,672
-Marble, even.
-It's a bit uncomfortable, isn't it?

728
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,883
Wait, look.

729
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,637
Just lay out the fox.

730
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,222
-Be nice.
-Okay, well...

731
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:51,349
-Cozy, like that.
-Yeah.

732
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:56,354
-Come on.
-I just need a few more minutes, that's all.

733
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,315
Why?

734
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:06,239
Just to savor the moment
of looking at you, that's all.

735
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:17,667
Was you serious when you said
you liked how that bracelet looked on me?

736
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:19,627
Just now, at Cartier?

737
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:27,260
'Cause you said if I really felt like
I couldn't live without it...

738
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,763
And you've decided you can't live without it.

739
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,147
Three more minutes.

740
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:45,319
I've got such a crush on my boss.

741
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,029
I know he's married. I'm married.

742
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,824
But honestly, if he asked me
to run off with him tomorrow,

743
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,952
I'd have to take a long, hard look at my life.

744
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,580
Not that he necessarily shares
the same feelings.

745
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:59,292
-Does he know your feelings?
-He knows I'm fond of him.

746
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,712
He did take me to the opera one night.

747
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,464
God, listen to me.
I sound like a crazy person.

748
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,635
-You're the wrong person to ask.
-Ask what?

749
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:15,808
I was going to take you out for a drink
and ask you to start a new gallery with me.

750
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:20,730
Are you joking? Our own business?
That's my dream.

751
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:24,150
Listen, a number of clients and artists
would dump Lois Geller in a heartbeat

752
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,359
and come with me.

753
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,862
And you have such a good eye
for the new painters.

754
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:32,158
I mean, yes, it's expensive,
but if we each raise half the money...

755
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,244
I just can't believe this.

756
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,038
The timing's right.

757
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,052
Can you believe he wound up
with that hot little wet dream?

758
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:54,931
She's unbelievable. Look. Look.
Whatever it costs him, it's worth it.

759
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:58,017
That body. I bet she's an acrobat.

760
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:03,189
I'll bet she knows a few tricks.
I wonder if she plays around?

761
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,899
I got to find out.

762
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,401
-No.
-Life's a risk, boys.

763
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,654
You going to pump iron, then?

764
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,156
No. She's out of your league, man.
Don't you...

765
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,283
-You gonna?
-Yeah.

766
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,035
If you don't, I will.

767
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:22,124
I think I prefer this one, just slightly.
The brightness.

768
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,294
Yeah. Didn't he say that he wanted me
to include this one, too?

769
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,589
Yeah, definitely. Let's not forget this.
This is brilliant.

770
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,883
I mean, the blue, it's just...

771
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:35,179
And side by side, I think.
They'll be really good side by side.

772
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:37,473
Do you want a drink? Tea or water?

773
00:49:37,557 --> 00:49:39,558
Tea is lovely, thank you.

774
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:43,437
I told you he'd do a great job
of promoting you.

775
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,689
He's a dynamo.

776
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,649
He thinks the world of you.

777
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:50,361
Really? Why? Did he say something?

778
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:54,448
Well, he obviously has enormous respect
for yourjudgment,

779
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,617
and supposedly a total dependency

780
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,869
on the chocolate truffles
you turned him on to.

781
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:04,917
Yeah, it's funny. I have a confession.

782
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,338
I've come to the conclusion that...

783
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,593
Have you...

784
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,179
Have you always had those earrings?

785
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:21,684
These pearls? No, they're new.

786
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,438
Where did you get them?

787
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,148
They were a gift.

788
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,400
A gift.

789
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:34,196
All right, you have to promise
that you won't tell anybody, okay?

790
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,616
They're from Greg.

791
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,245
What?

792
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,998
Yeah, they're from Greg.

793
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,043
I shouldn't even be blabbing about this,

794
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:53,507
but we've kind of been having
a little something together.

795
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,301
A what?

796
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,637
An affair.

797
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,933
It sounds so dramatic, doesn't it?
But that's what it is.

798
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,644
We've been having an affair.

799
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,148
Please, don't look so shell-shocked. Don't.

800
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,566
He's married.

801
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,943
Yeah, but we all know
what a shambles that is,

802
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,779
and it's not because of me.

803
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:18,574
I don't know, it just all got very serious,
very quickly.

804
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,742
Since when?

805
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:23,829
For a while now. At first, we just met
and we talked about my work.

806
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,750
He is so perceptive. And then he told me...

807
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,128
He told me I wandered into his dream,

808
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,255
and he put his hand on mine

809
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,716
and told me how miserable he was at home

810
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:39,428
and, well, things just went from there.

811
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,348
He's a fabulous lover, and...

812
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,102
I just don't know.
I don't want him to leave his wife for me,

813
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,187
and he was going to do that already.

814
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:55,027
I don't know, it feels like I'm in a soap opera,
but it's so lovely.

815
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,613
But I don't know if it's just a reaction,

816
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:01,700
you know, after spending six years
with a wife that's bipolar.

817
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,869
I don't know.

818
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,747
Are you okay?

819
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,086
Will you please not leave
your bicycle in the hallway?

820
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,046
I nearly broke my neck.

821
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,633
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. Did you hear anything?

822
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:18,759
About?

823
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,804
What the hell do you think about?
Your book!

824
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:25,349
Hey, back off! What is eating you?

825
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:29,228
I've been by the goddamned phone all day!
What's the problem?

826
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:33,691
I can't stand working for Greg Clemente!
He treats me like a fucking secretary!

827
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:37,945
Book his tables, get his lunches,
arrange his theater tickets!

828
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:40,406
I need my own gallery!

829
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,326
I've got a headache. My head is splitting!

830
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,828
Take your pills.

831
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:49,081
What the hell do you think
I'm trying to do here?

832
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,876
Where are they? Excuse me.

833
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,503
I thought you liked working for him.

834
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,631
I need to start a family!

835
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:02,970
You know, I wouldn't have to be doing this
if you could just support us.

836
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:05,514
You know what? You've had trouble
on your last three jobs.

837
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,349
Maybe it's not always your employers.

838
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,352
Yeah? What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

839
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,605
Look, start your own art gallery!

840
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,191
And with what?

841
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,234
We can't afford to
pay the food and rent around here

842
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,402
without my mother helping!

843
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,697
Hey, you have a migraine!
Don't take it out on me!

844
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,704
Hello.

845
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,040
Roy? Malcolm Dodds.

846
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,584
Hello.

847
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:37,796
Hi. Look, we are so sorry that
we've held you up for so long on this book.

848
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,507
But there's been a lot of talk about it up here,

849
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:45,179
and we've decided
it's not going to work for us.

850
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,390
And?

851
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,726
I mean, obviously, we liked it.

852
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,854
But it's not that different
to something else we're going to publish,

853
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,649
and we didn't want two books
with the same idea.

854
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,275
I see.

855
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,740
But in the end, you preferred the other one.

856
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:08,869
To be perfectly frank, Roy,
there are nice moments in it.

857
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:12,665
But a lot of people here
didn't think it was your best work.

858
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,000
Anyway, I hope you're going to try us again.

859
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,670
What if I can rewrite it?

860
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,048
Am I disturbing you?

861
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,634
Mum, can't you call sometimes
before you come over?

862
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,261
I've got a horrible headache.

863
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,138
-Migraines are tension, darling.
-Yes, I know what migraines are!

864
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:31,100
And I need to change my life.

865
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:34,186
You shouldn't be working.
You should be raising a family.

866
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,605
I really don't want
to discuss this right now, Mum.

867
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,983
Well, I've come to share
an incredible insight.

868
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:42,444
I've spent two hours with Cristal Delgiorno,
two riveting hours.

869
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:43,654
I'm not in the mood.

870
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:46,365
I'm just not in the mood
to get into any of that right now.

871
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,491
Can I help myself to a drink?

872
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,326
For some reason,
I love your brand of whiskey.

873
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,911
I'm not normally a whiskey drinker.

874
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,497
Well, that's it. They rejected my novel.

875
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,916
-Roy.
-They don't think it comes off.

876
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,210
Not my best work, try harder.

877
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,422
After all this time,
leaving you dangling like that.

878
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:04,216
I can't try harder. That's all I have in me.

879
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:07,011
You gave them sections to read.
They seemed okay with it.

880
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,805
They seemed to like sections,
but the whole book...

881
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:12,182
-Can I tell you an insight?
-What? What is it?

882
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:15,019
Well, I know
you're going to pooh-pooh this, Roy,

883
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,478
being so scientific minded,

884
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:19,982
but it turns out that I've lived before.

885
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,650
No. No, Mother!

886
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:25,154
No, I've existed before in other incarnations!
Cristal is certain of it.

887
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,948
Look, Helena, I'm not in the mood
for that crap right now, okay?

888
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,199
-No, no, no. I'm not.
-But...

889
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:32,828
But you will be in the mood
when you realize the importance of that fact.

890
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:35,164
If it's so for me, it's so for everyone.
You, as well.

891
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,915
Make her shut up, Sally. I'm going to kill her.

892
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,003
Please, let's not get ugly here.
Mum, he just got some really bad news.

893
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:45,007
If you mean the rejection of that silly book,
I tried to prepare you for it.

894
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,091
Cristal predicted it.

895
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,885
I was sure the book came off fine.

896
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,511
Am I that blind about my own work?

897
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,598
Cristal says your future is not in the arts.

898
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,558
I'm telling you, Sally,
get her out of here! Out!

899
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:58,395
Well, what's wrong with medicine?
You have the education.

900
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,024
If writing is not in your future,
medicine is a noble way to earn a living.

901
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,942
Okay, all right... Are you thick?

902
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,529
I am never going to be a doctor, okay?
That boat sailed years ago, okay?

903
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:11,784
You got it? Maybe I'll be
a chauffeur or a messenger.

904
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,620
So, your daughter married badly.
Now can you get the hell out?

905
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:18,832
How can you ask her to get out
when she is the one paying the rent?

906
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,585
I'm sick of hearing that. She'll get it back,
she'll get all the money back!

907
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,462
How will she get it back?

908
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,130
What are you gonna do, rob a bank?

909
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:29,051
I am sick and tired of sitting around,
watching my life evaporate,

910
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:30,844
while you keep trying to prove a point!

911
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,847
It's all futile. Cristal said it's not his moment.

912
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,725
Arcadia was the only one interested,
but they're knowledgeable men,

913
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,227
so I guess it doesn't come off!

914
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:41,730
Cristal was right! I have to face it!
I was a one-book fluke!

915
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,274
Cristal said at some point,
in the distant future.

916
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,818
Maybe she was talking about another life.

917
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:50,864
Mother! Will you be still?
You drink and chatter incessantly!

918
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:52,991
Christ, my head is killing me.

919
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:56,954
I drank a little, yes,
to celebrate the miraculous!

920
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,288
Is that so terrible?

921
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,749
That I come here with great news,

922
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:05,254
news that renders all this futile
in the grand scheme of things.

923
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,715
I mean, I'm saying we don't only live once.

924
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,926
We live over and over again.

925
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,888
Cristal says I existed in Elizabethan England.

926
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:19,351
All I'm saying is there's hope,
hope that maybe Roy will write another book,

927
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,728
but in some future incarnation.

928
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,111
I've got to get out of here!

929
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:37,494
Oh, God. I can't do it anymore.
I can't be in this marriage.

930
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,080
Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.

931
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,207
You can do so much better.

932
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,501
You know, Cristal says that
that man you work for,

933
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:49,089
the one you're always so high on.
She says don't rule him out.

934
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:58,932
At that moment,
with his life going down the drain,

935
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,435
Roy only wanted to see Dia.

936
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,690
And, suddenly, there she was.

937
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:24,791
But even if she wasn't getting married,
what the hell chance did he have?

938
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,794
What could he offer her? What was he?

939
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:32,508
A washed-up writer at 38?
A member of the "formerly promising" club?

940
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:37,471
"Royal Channing." A hell of a name
for a limo driver or a bike messenger.

941
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:41,016
The thought of beginning a new book
paralyzed him.

942
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,060
He'd lost all his nerve.

943
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:47,022
And what was he supposed to do,
work days and write nights?

944
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:49,900
Not that he had an idea for another book.

945
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:54,404
And just when you think
things can't possibly get any worse,

946
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:58,116
fate lets you know
there's bigger trouble out there.

947
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:04,998
Hello.

948
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,209
I just thought you should know.

949
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:10,671
Jeez, I'm in a state of shock here.
I can hardly speak.

950
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:14,007
There was a car accident,
a terrible car accident.

951
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:17,553
Mike Prince, Henry,
driving to the poker game.

952
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,514
Head-on collision with another car.
Two girls dead. Henry's dead.

953
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,057
Mike's in a coma.

954
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,560
Even a pedestrian on the pavement
is on the critical list.

955
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,061
It's just unbelievable.

956
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:29,815
Two teenage drunks nicked the car...
Bam! Unbelievable.

957
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:36,655
He couldn't get his mind around it.

958
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:40,576
Mike Prince in a coma? A vegetable?

959
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,828
Henry Strangler gone.

960
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,122
He wasn't even that close with them,

961
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:49,418
but it made him feel
how quick and fragile is existence.

962
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,507
And that's when he had his crazy thought.

963
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,769
Strangler lived alone.

964
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,981
He had no family,
no time for a woman in his life,

965
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:14,276
and was obsessively private
about his first novel.

966
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:19,072
Roy was the only one he'd trusted to read it,
this Roy knew for sure.

967
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:24,536
Strangler had just finished tweaking it
and had not shown it to Malcolm Dodds yet

968
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,955
because Roy was to arrange that.

969
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,790
Strangler had no agent

970
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,834
and none of the other poker players
were writers,

971
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:35,005
and so had no particular interest in
or knowledge of his progress.

972
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:40,260
The man was a drone,
a perfectionist, a workaholic.

973
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,973
Possibly a genius
who'd written a terrific first book,

974
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,393
but tragically and most conveniently,

975
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:50,937
he was dead.

976
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,925
I'm not familiar with your shop,

977
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,636
but I'll make it my business
to tell Cristal all about it.

978
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,474
Well, it's only small, but I think we carry
most of the important occult books.

979
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,852
-Do you have any literature on reincarnation?
-Yes.

980
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:34,648
You know, sometimes I get a clear flash
that I've visited a place before.

981
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,274
Perhaps ancient Egypt.

982
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,443
My son-in-law pooh-poohs it,

983
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,571
but if I didn't think there was more to life,
I couldn't go on.

984
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:45,367
You'd have got on well
with my dear, departed Claire.

985
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:50,956
I've tried unsuccessfully to contact her
so far, but I won't give up.

986
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:54,084
You obviously cared for her very deeply.

987
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,546
Yes, it's been very lonely without her.

988
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,551
It's got quite a bit of a kick to it.
It's got some chili oil in it.

989
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:06,430
Hey, come on, get dressed.
We're meeting the Hoveys in 45 minutes.

990
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,558
What are you doing?

991
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,768
Come on. Get dressed.
We're meeting the Hoveys.

992
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,980
I don't feel like seeing
one of them boring plays again.

993
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,898
Well, this'll be great. Come on.

994
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:20,902
That's what you said about the one Friday
and it was so boring.

995
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,406
It was! Weren't even scary.

996
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,908
Well, the ghosts were meant to be symbolic.

997
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,911
It wasn't intended to be a scary play,
you know?

998
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:36,626
Come on, look, it's not that I don't like
being at home with you, believe me.

999
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:40,380
It's too quiet in this house.
It's like a freaking echo.

1000
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,759
You never like watching any of the telly I like.

1001
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,845
Okay, well, I don't know.
What the hell are we talking about here?

1002
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:53,518
What?

1003
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:57,689
I'd like to do more things I like
once in a while.

1004
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,317
Okay, all right. The rest of the week,
we'll do what you want.

1005
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:02,152
Is that okay? Okay?

1006
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:06,990
Come to the show tonight, and we'll do...
You call the shots the rest of the week.

1007
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:08,617
How about that?

1008
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,540
This is banging, isn't it?

1009
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,626
I love this tune.

1010
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:30,472
-Alfie, can I have a dance with him?
-What?

1011
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,099
Can I dance with him? It's boring just sitting.

1012
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,226
Yes?

1013
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:37,687
-Okay. Don't stay out there too long.
-I won't.

1014
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,844
Sally announced to Roy
she was starting her own gallery

1015
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,096
and the time had come for a divorce.

1016
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:16,268
By now, Dia had strong romantic ideas
about sharing her life with a writer.

1017
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:20,063
-Your book is really riveting.
-Thank you.

1018
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:24,484
You obviously must have spent
a lot of time in Ireland and Scotland.

1019
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:29,531
Some. I did a lot of research.
A lot of research.

1020
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:32,909
I thought you told me
you've never been to Ireland.

1021
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:36,830
Northern Ireland.
But I've been to other places.

1022
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:39,875
I've been to Connemara.
That's one of the places I've been.

1023
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:43,461
I loved so much the style of your writing,
you know?

1024
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,089
Each word clicks along the page,

1025
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:52,387
and your characters are so rich
and almost startling.

1026
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:55,348
Wow. Thank you.
That's a huge compliment, coming from you.

1027
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,474
-Thank you so much.
-No, no. It's all right.

1028
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,727
It is. He hardly likes anything, believe me.

1029
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,520
How's Alan, sweetheart?

1030
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:03,148
-He's good, Mom.
-Is he coming this weekend?

1031
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:05,650
Your father is very encouraging.

1032
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,569
And he's a lovely guy.

1033
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:09,905
Well, he's not that lovely
when he doesn't like something.

1034
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,156
No?

1035
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,367
He's written a lot of criticism
for small literary magazines

1036
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,745
and nothing much impresses him.

1037
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:21,207
Well, what can I say? You're my muse.

1038
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:24,127
You popped into my life
just when I needed divine inspiration.

1039
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:25,670
It's amazing.

1040
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:29,007
-Well, that's what a muse does, right?
-I guess so.

1041
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:33,887
-I love it here.
-It's lovely weather.

1042
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:45,565
I don't even want to think what I'm thinking.

1043
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,776
I can think of nothing else.

1044
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:51,279
What am I going to do?

1045
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,366
What I want you to do?

1046
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,954
I want you as my forever muse.

1047
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:03,917
Here, or in Paris. I write,
we open wine bottles, we make love.

1048
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:09,547
They're all en route for the wedding.
Alan's family, his relatives and our friends.

1049
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,051
Alan's going to be devastated.

1050
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,601
That's okay.

1051
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:23,895
It's so wrong.

1052
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:29,442
Look, I've told you before
not to make any large purchase

1053
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,319
without consulting me first.

1054
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:33,321
But you said I could have them both.

1055
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,324
That was a while ago.
The picture's changed now.

1056
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:37,784
Did you go bust or something?

1057
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:42,539
God, I've tried to explain to you,
at this point in time, cash is tight.

1058
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:46,626
I lost a lot in the stock market
and Helena won't budge on the alimony.

1059
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:50,338
We have to be more budget conscious,
that's all I'm saying.

1060
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:53,591
Hey, come here.

1061
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,887
You know how much I like to pamper you
and get you nice things.

1062
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:02,017
But just ask me
before you spend this kind of money,

1063
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:04,978
until I catch up on some expenditure, okay?

1064
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,773
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, I am, too, if I yelled.

1065
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:15,780
Your face is all red.
You've got to watch your blood pressure.

1066
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,240
Remember what the doctor said.

1067
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:21,244
He says I've got
the arteries of a man half my age.

1068
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:24,789
You know, I just have to get
to the gym more often to exercise.

1069
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:30,837
I'm just working so hard. Yeah.
Hey, coat looks beautiful.

1070
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:32,297
Fantastic.

1071
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:37,302
The truth was that business reverses
and Alfie's extravagance

1072
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:40,013
had led him into serious financial trouble.

1073
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:44,851
And while he tried to keep up appearances,
he had become over his head in debt.

1074
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:02,327
Your back any better?

1075
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,162
What?

1076
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:06,331
I said, your back any better?

1077
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,666
Yeah. I've done my leg in now.

1078
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,629
I think I overdid the pedaling
when you weren't around.

1079
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:15,840
Well, I should come around more often.
Let me have a look.

1080
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,051
You probably sprained it or something.

1081
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:19,344
Come on.

1082
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:28,353
You do have the touch.

1083
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:31,147
I should be paying you,
not the other way around.

1084
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:34,025
I'm very expensive.

1085
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:40,949
You know, there's a rumor
that before you married Alfie Shepridge

1086
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:43,076
that you worked in Las Vegas.

1087
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,828
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

1088
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:47,122
Were you in a show there?

1089
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:49,582
Someone said a cocktail waitress.

1090
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:52,710
But I reckon you were a model.

1091
01:08:54,839 --> 01:09:00,468
Whatever it was I did,
you can bet I was pretty good.

1092
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,097
You must have enjoyed your work.

1093
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,974
Well, why wouldn't I?

1094
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,394
On the other hand, if you liked it so much,

1095
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:14,858
maybe you wouldn't have retired
and married Alfie Shepridge.

1096
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:19,404
Well, if I said with some,
it wasn't always great.

1097
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:24,826
But with most of the men I met,
it was very stimulating.

1098
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,831
In what way was it stimulating?

1099
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,876
I learned a lot of things.

1100
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:38,256
I met some very handsome actors
who liked to party.

1101
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:41,718
Some footballers who were pretty athletic.

1102
01:09:42,094 --> 01:09:43,845
What'd they teach you?

1103
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:46,931
Let's say we taught each other.

1104
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:51,436
You want to teach me?

1105
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:58,985
Not here.

1106
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:03,323
I'm not yelling!

1107
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:05,700
Christ, can you blame me for being upset?

1108
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:08,536
Of course he's upset.
Do you know what you're doing?

1109
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,914
Can you all control yourselves, please?

1110
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:14,709
We've got 1 23 people to notify.
Some of them have already flown in.

1111
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:17,879
They're coming from Europe,
from Spain and Lugano.

1112
01:10:17,963 --> 01:10:20,882
Yes, I know that. I know that.

1113
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:23,176
-Have you met someone else?
-What about the caterers, the band?

1114
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,220
-This is not the time to discuss...
-Have you met someone else?

1115
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,222
The band is getting on a plane
right now from India!

1116
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:29,474
-Do you know how much this is gonna cost?
-Yes.

1117
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:30,725
-She's met somebody else?
-Yes, I did.

1118
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:33,937
-What?
-Who is he? Where did you meet him?

1119
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,104
I don't want to talk about it!

1120
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:37,732
Tarak, please! She's met someone else!

1121
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,734
-She's met someone else?
-She's met someone else.

1122
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:42,278
-When?
-I can't believe this is happening.

1123
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,405
-Stupid. She's stupid.
-I cannot believe it.

1124
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,367
Well, I guess if you can
fall in love so quickly,

1125
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:50,036
-it's probably good we found out now.
-It's not that I don't care about you.

1126
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,621
-Don't give me that!
-I'm really sorry. I feel awful.

1127
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:53,581
-I didn't plan this.
-We had so many plans.

1128
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:57,085
-I hate you. I hate you!
-Becky, that's enough.

1129
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:59,879
Excuse me, don't you shout at my daughter.
That's my job.

1130
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,297
Excuse me?

1131
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,883
-How could she do this to my brother?
-Becky, Becky, calm down.

1132
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:06,427
Can we all just calm down?

1133
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,429
It's so disrespectful!

1134
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:09,639
Calm down!

1135
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,022
There you are, darling.

1136
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:22,402
Do you recognize this?
We've passed here a million times.

1137
01:11:22,903 --> 01:11:25,280
I haven't seen you so perky in ages, Mum.

1138
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:28,449
He's a very spiritual man.
We have a lot to talk about.

1139
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:32,036
Cristal says it has positive future potential.
Come on.

1140
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:37,792
There's a nice old pub on the corner.
Let me go and close up.

1141
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:38,918
Good.

1142
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:42,714
Has your mother told you
I've grown very fond of her?

1143
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:52,390
Isn't he the most interesting man?

1144
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:55,643
I'm just so glad you found somebody.

1145
01:11:55,728 --> 01:12:00,064
Well, he may not be a tall, dark stranger,
but he's become my stranger.

1146
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:04,068
Mum, you always said that if I needed
a loan to start my own business,

1147
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,361
I could count on you.

1148
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:08,948
And, well, there's nowhere else I can go.

1149
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,075
To open your own gallery? Of course.

1150
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,036
Cristal said you've got
a new future ahead of you,

1151
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,996
now you're rid of that albatross.

1152
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,124
Yes. I want to start over.

1153
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:22,128
What about that exciting man you work for?

1154
01:12:22,212 --> 01:12:24,839
I know, you said he was married,

1155
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:27,633
but I seem to recall
you did say there were problems.

1156
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:32,055
Well, I wish I could say that
I left Roy for Greg, but no such luck.

1157
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:35,016
Don't be defeatist.
I knew you were wild about him.

1158
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,101
I asked Cristal about it.

1159
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:40,271
She said she got the distinct impression

1160
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,523
that you ought to make
your feelings known to him.

1161
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:45,943
Well, I think he knew. I think.

1162
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:54,077
You know, Sally, I'm very sorry
to hear you'll be leaving.

1163
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:56,954
But at the same time,

1164
01:12:58,791 --> 01:13:01,292
you know, I wish you only the best.

1165
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:05,171
Because you actually deserve it.

1166
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:10,051
I really appreciate all the experience here.

1167
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:14,639
You know, of all of my assistants,

1168
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,351
I enjoyed working with you
the most, actually.

1169
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:21,979
In truth,

1170
01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:27,151
I think I was beginning to grow

1171
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:30,655
maybe a little too fond
of the time we spent together.

1172
01:13:32,032 --> 01:13:35,993
Well, we had very much
the same artistic tastes.

1173
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:39,705
And I'm sure that had become very obvious.

1174
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:41,207
What had?

1175
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:47,255
That I was starting to feel
a little too close to you.

1176
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,215
Not at all.

1177
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:52,176
You certainly did a great job. You did.

1178
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:55,847
Actually...

1179
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:01,394
How can I say this? It's not just the gallery.

1180
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:05,398
My life is kind of in flux right now.

1181
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:08,985
Roy and I are getting a divorce.

1182
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,487
I'm sorry to hear that.

1183
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:17,743
I remember you saying
that you were having problems at home, too.

1184
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:24,000
Well, I shouldn't say anything about this,
but Carol and I are splitting up,

1185
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:30,631
and I've started seeing your protege.

1186
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:32,967
Iris.

1187
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:44,479
Maybe I should have told you things
weren't going so well with my husband

1188
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:48,274
and I was ripe for an affair.

1189
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:50,193
Maybe, who knows?

1190
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:54,822
Maybe we could have wound up dating
before you met Iris.

1191
01:14:54,907 --> 01:14:56,491
What can I say?

1192
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:59,660
You know I only wish you the best
on your new project.

1193
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:04,957
But I suppose you could never
have seen yourself returning my feelings.

1194
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:08,753
You often said your fondest dream
was to open your own gallery,

1195
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,129
so now you have it.

1196
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:11,547
Could you?

1197
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:12,840
What?

1198
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,719
See yourself?

1199
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:19,514
What?

1200
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,351
Have seen us together?

1201
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:31,776
We were coworkers, friends, certainly.
Colleagues.

1202
01:15:33,779 --> 01:15:35,863
And now we are competitors.

1203
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:40,076
You see how ironic and beautiful life is?

1204
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:04,308
Driver, pull over.

1205
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:26,581
Ray? What are you doing here?
You're out of your way, aren't you?

1206
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,708
-Yeah...
-Did you see my wife?

1207
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,334
She came out of the hotel just now.

1208
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,920
Mrs. Shepridge? No, I didn't, to be honest.

1209
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:36,257
I just passed in the taxi
and I just saw her coming out of the hotel.

1210
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:37,675
Honestly, I didn't see her. No.

1211
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,886
-What are you doing over here anyway?
-I live just down there.

1212
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:43,598
But, I'll see you soon.

1213
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:45,349
Yeah. You didn't?

1214
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:56,110
So, what were you doing
at the Hotel Lucerne today?

1215
01:16:57,571 --> 01:17:01,032
I said, what were you doing
at the Hotel Lucerne today?

1216
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:03,659
I wasn't at the Hotel Lucerne.

1217
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,995
I thought I saw you.

1218
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:09,999
Well, you must have been mistaken.

1219
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:21,135
So, where were you at noon today?

1220
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,055
I was in the gym.

1221
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,435
And if you don't believe me,
you can ask Ray Richards.

1222
01:17:29,519 --> 01:17:32,063
He was showing me
one of those new machines they got.

1223
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:39,987
The day came when Roy moved out.

1224
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,823
And for the time being,
where else could he move,

1225
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,533
but in with Dia?

1226
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:20,027
I mean, we don't just want it.
We are absolutely ecstatic.

1227
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:23,739
Everybody, literally everybody who's read it
has been knocked out.

1228
01:18:23,824 --> 01:18:26,951
Bill Cousin said to me,
"I can't believe the same man

1229
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,869
"who wrote his last two books
wrote this one."

1230
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,288
Nothing you've done could prepare us for it.

1231
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:34,834
Anyway, my theory is this.
This is the real you,

1232
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:36,210
and what you were doing before

1233
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:38,879
was you were forcing your books
to accommodate your intellectual ideas.

1234
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,131
No, thank you.

1235
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:44,719
Anyway, we all believe that
this makes you emerge as a major talent.

1236
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:47,888
Do you remember this place?

1237
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:51,434
We ate our dinner here
the first night we went out.

1238
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:53,269
Do you remember? We sat over there.

1239
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:54,562
-Remember that?
-I do, indeed.

1240
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:55,646
They knocked that wall down.

1241
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,857
You were so insecure.
Do you remember that?

1242
01:18:57,941 --> 01:18:59,066
Yeah, I wanted to impress you.

1243
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,069
I remember the date,
it was 9th of January, 1 970.

1244
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,155
It was a Friday. I forget nothing.

1245
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:07,158
No, you don't. Of course, you loved me then.

1246
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,661
Oh, don't say "then" just like that. "Then."

1247
01:19:10,954 --> 01:19:14,206
You make it sound like another lifetime.
Thank you.

1248
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,669
I mean, we've been through
so much together.

1249
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:22,923
Sally's various growing pains,
and the loss of Paul.

1250
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:25,009
Let's not talk about it.

1251
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:28,095
Well, we got each other through it,
didn't we?

1252
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:31,056
Not quite.

1253
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:41,776
Helena, is there any chance
that we could begin again?

1254
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:44,862
What?

1255
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:49,074
I made a terrible mistake.

1256
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:55,164
My life is so messed up.
I can't tell you how messed up it is.

1257
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:58,083
But, Alfie, you're recently married.

1258
01:19:58,668 --> 01:20:02,379
I know. I blundered. I made a stupid mistake.
I screwed up.

1259
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:07,510
I'm so fucking scared of being alone.
Excuse me, but...

1260
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:12,723
And then I saw my life slipping away,
and I panicked.

1261
01:20:13,391 --> 01:20:16,727
Alfie, you'll live again.

1262
01:20:18,396 --> 01:20:20,731
We don't just live one life.

1263
01:20:22,025 --> 01:20:25,820
The world is far more mysterious
than it appears to our eyes.

1264
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,530
What are you talking about?

1265
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,782
I've lived before.

1266
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:33,494
Cristal pointed it out and it's clear to me,
and to Jonathan.

1267
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:35,704
Who's Jonathan?

1268
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:42,127
Jonathan is a gentleman
I've been keeping company with.

1269
01:20:43,588 --> 01:20:45,673
So you've met someone else, have you?

1270
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,552
Yes. Someone who shares
my spiritual ideals.

1271
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:51,428
For God's sake, come on.

1272
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,223
All I'm saying is that...

1273
01:20:57,727 --> 01:21:00,896
I want you back. I need you.

1274
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:05,401
I have a new life. I've moved on.

1275
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:09,363
You have a new wife. You're married.

1276
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:14,368
And I'm sure she'll give you
the son you've always wanted.

1277
01:21:30,343 --> 01:21:32,136
What the hell is going on here?

1278
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,930
-Nothing.
-Where are you going? Fuck off.

1279
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:36,432
Alfie, Alfie!

1280
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:38,726
Don't touch me! You want some?

1281
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:40,936
He was just trying to... No!

1282
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,355
Ray? Help!

1283
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,441
Fuck!

1284
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:56,994
If you can hear me, Claire Wunch,
make yourself known.

1285
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:03,000
Is that you, Claire?

1286
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:07,212
If the spirit is Claire, please signal,

1287
01:22:08,381 --> 01:22:11,675
one for yes, two for no.

1288
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:17,848
Are you all right, Claire? Are you happy?

1289
01:22:22,854 --> 01:22:27,149
I still love you very much, Claire.
Do you care for me?

1290
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:30,569
Ask her.

1291
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:34,740
I will always care for you, my darling Claire.

1292
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,579
-Ask her, Jonathan.
-Just wait.

1293
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:46,669
Claire, I've always been faithful.

1294
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:48,879
I love you.

1295
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:51,590
Ask her about us.

1296
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:54,134
Yes. I don't want to upset her.

1297
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:57,930
You said you needed her permission.
Ask her.

1298
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:03,560
Claire, you know you've always been the one.

1299
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:09,733
-I can't.
-Ask her, for Christ's sake!

1300
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:12,611
Please. Please, this is difficult for me.

1301
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,906
I still love the woman.

1302
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:19,368
Helena! Please, Helena!

1303
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,413
Boys, here she is.

1304
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:25,791
Guys, meet Dia, my muse and future wife.

1305
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:28,460
Hello, Dia. Where's he been hiding you?

1306
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:30,838
Have you been
in the Witness Protection Program?

1307
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:32,715
It's like you dropped off the world
or something.

1308
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:34,008
Give me a break. Give me a break.

1309
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:36,719
Look, my marriage broke up,
I've had to move out,

1310
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:39,179
-my novel's being rushed into print.
-That's right.

1311
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:43,642
And I've been exploring the erogenous zones
of this incredible creature.

1312
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:46,520
I hear wonderful things about your book.
When do we read it?

1313
01:23:46,604 --> 01:23:47,980
There'll be freebies for everybody.

1314
01:23:48,064 --> 01:23:51,275
Who can blame me if I've been a little
overwhelmed by events of the last month?

1315
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:53,986
I wanted to get to the funeral. I just couldn't.

1316
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:58,824
That whole thing was so tragic.
I mean, it was just so awful.

1317
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:00,159
How is Mike coming?

1318
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:02,536
You know, people come out
of comas sometimes and they're okay.

1319
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:03,996
It happens.

1320
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,081
No, Mike's not in a coma.

1321
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:08,333
-Don't tell me he died.
-Yeah, he did.

1322
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:10,544
Oh, God.

1323
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:13,213
Or was it for the best
if he was going to be a vegetable?

1324
01:24:13,298 --> 01:24:16,717
No, Mike was never in a coma.
He died straightaway.

1325
01:24:16,801 --> 01:24:18,761
Strangler's in the coma.

1326
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:22,514
What are you talking about?

1327
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:24,224
Mike died instantly.

1328
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:26,935
Strangler's the one who's in the coma.

1329
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:31,106
No. I thought you told me that Strangler died.

1330
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:33,233
No, no, no. No!

1331
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:37,112
Either you misunderstood,
or, you know, I was so hysterical.

1332
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:40,949
Well, you know they pulled the bodies out.
Maybe I said Strangler.

1333
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:42,201
Maybe I did.

1334
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:48,624
But, no, first... I mean, in fact
they thought at first that it was Strangler.

1335
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,250
But that's the confusion.

1336
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:54,797
That's the confusion
because we thought, yes, but no.

1337
01:24:54,881 --> 01:24:57,966
Strangler is in a coma,

1338
01:24:58,051 --> 01:25:00,427
but they think that there's a good chance
that he could come out of it.

1339
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,805
Yes. He had an awful trauma,

1340
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:05,224
and the truth is at first
they thought it was hopeless,

1341
01:25:05,308 --> 01:25:07,726
but now, touch wood, it's 50-50.

1342
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:12,689
Yeah. I mean, of course, how he turns out
if he does come out of it is anybody's guess.

1343
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:13,899
I mean, he could be a cabbage.

1344
01:25:13,983 --> 01:25:16,735
No, they say there's a good chance
he could be okay.

1345
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:20,656
It depends. It's a mysterious area.
They can't really predict.

1346
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:25,661
Hey! They just had on television
three people in comas after long periods.

1347
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:30,499
They all came out of it. They were all fine.
One of them went back to being a teacher.

1348
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:37,047
Strangler's trauma wasn't as terrible
as everyone thought to begin with.

1349
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:40,217
In fact, it could go either way. Are you okay?

1350
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,470
What's happening, Roy?
You've just suddenly turned white.

1351
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,556
-Are you okay?
-I need something to drink.

1352
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:50,102
Listen, Roy, the doctors encourage people
to visit him and talk to him.

1353
01:25:50,186 --> 01:25:51,812
They think that maybe he can hear.

1354
01:25:51,896 --> 01:25:53,480
So, we're going to go down later this week.

1355
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,607
Why don't you come along?
Because he was very fond of you. Yeah?

1356
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:57,818
-Okay, yeah.
-Okay. We'll go.

1357
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,571
I've got to see a doctor!
I think I've put my back out!

1358
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:02,281
I've broken a rib. Jesus!

1359
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,242
I've broken a rib.

1360
01:26:05,910 --> 01:26:08,245
Alfie, can we just leave it now?

1361
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:10,706
-Let's move on. Yeah?
-No.

1362
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:13,584
Nothing happened! I mean...

1363
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:17,546
I mean, I know it looked bad,

1364
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:21,550
and your face hurts and all,
but can you just stop being angry?

1365
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:24,511
I am angry! Jesus Christ.

1366
01:26:25,054 --> 01:26:26,180
Don't be angry,

1367
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:29,850
'cause I've got something to tell you
that's gonna make you so happy.

1368
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:32,936
Alfie?

1369
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:39,109
-What?
-I'm pregnant.

1370
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:41,695
-A child?
-Yeah.

1371
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:44,072
-You're going to have a child?
-Yes.

1372
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:45,532
A baby.

1373
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:55,459
How can I be sure it's mine?

1374
01:26:57,545 --> 01:27:01,632
'Cause I've been telling you!

1375
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:05,135
Alfie, I've been telling you!
He forced himself on me!

1376
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,429
I couldn't get away!

1377
01:27:07,513 --> 01:27:10,557
He said he was gonna teach me
some stretching exercises.

1378
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:15,187
I can't move 'cause I'm so scared,
I'm in shock.

1379
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:19,316
I can't move my body,
and he's kissing me so much, I can't scream.

1380
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:26,907
You should be over the moon.

1381
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:31,328
It's what you wanted.

1382
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:37,542
How long have you been sleeping with him?
And who else? How many others?

1383
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,380
What do you think I am?

1384
01:27:41,839 --> 01:27:45,801
There are tests. There are DNA tests.
I'll have the baby tested.

1385
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:48,804
I am not having my baby tested.

1386
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:50,931
It's yours!

1387
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:53,308
I'll believe that when I have it tested.

1388
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:56,687
Please, don't make me angrier
than I am at you.

1389
01:27:57,563 --> 01:28:00,065
Those tests aren't even 1 00% right, so.

1390
01:28:00,149 --> 01:28:01,525
Yes, it is.

1391
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:08,031
And for all our sakes,
I'd better be the father. Believe me.

1392
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:12,244
What's the difference?

1393
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,081
You always wanted a kid.

1394
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:19,209
I want a son. I lost a son.

1395
01:28:20,044 --> 01:28:23,213
I lost a little boy. I want it to be my son.

1396
01:28:23,756 --> 01:28:25,132
You understand?

1397
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:31,346
Who's going to know?

1398
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:33,432
I'll know,

1399
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:35,058
if it's a boy

1400
01:28:36,519 --> 01:28:39,146
and if I decide to have it tested.

1401
01:28:43,943 --> 01:28:45,027
Mum!

1402
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:49,406
Hello?

1403
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,414
What are you doing?
Didn't you hear me ringing?

1404
01:28:57,832 --> 01:29:03,003
I do believe that I existed in a prior life,
a happier life, Sally.

1405
01:29:03,087 --> 01:29:05,756
I get intimations of it all the time.

1406
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,259
I was about to embark
on an adventure with a stranger.

1407
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:14,431
I don't like it when you talk to yourself.
You spend too much time alone.

1408
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:16,558
What happened to Jonathan?

1409
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:21,605
I've been all over it with Cristal.
He left me for another woman.

1410
01:29:21,689 --> 01:29:23,148
No.

1411
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:24,775
A deceased one.

1412
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:29,529
They're often the stiffest competition.
No pun intended.

1413
01:29:31,115 --> 01:29:34,284
But Cristal says my future's looking good.

1414
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:37,788
I had hoped things would work out.

1415
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:41,333
I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do?

1416
01:29:41,959 --> 01:29:42,959
No.

1417
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:49,007
Well, Mum, Cristal always seems to know
what's best for you.

1418
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:52,052
And if she says the future looks good,
you can bet on it.

1419
01:29:52,136 --> 01:29:56,223
Another life.
I just have to shed the old one and try again.

1420
01:29:59,435 --> 01:30:04,689
Mum, I know I told you
about a substantial loan I'd need

1421
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:06,358
to get the art gallery started up,

1422
01:30:06,442 --> 01:30:10,821
but, well, it turns out
it's a bit more than I anticipated.

1423
01:30:11,864 --> 01:30:13,115
Not a lot.

1424
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,450
And it'll all come back to you,

1425
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:18,078
but maybe not for a year or two.

1426
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:23,333
About the loan, darling,
the timing right now is wrong.

1427
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:26,044
With interest, of course. What?

1428
01:30:26,879 --> 01:30:28,380
The aspects are not right.

1429
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,133
What are you talking about? What aspects?

1430
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:35,095
I spoke to Cristal, and she said I can't do it

1431
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:38,014
because the stars
are not in the right alignment.

1432
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:40,183
What?

1433
01:30:40,518 --> 01:30:43,311
Cristal said the planets tell her

1434
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:49,943
I must not enter into any financial
transactions for the indefinite future.

1435
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:52,946
And certainly the loan
comes under that heading.

1436
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:55,615
Mother, she doesn't know
what she's talking about.

1437
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:58,743
-Sally.
-Mother, I was counting on that money!

1438
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:02,998
Someday, perhaps, but not with
the planets in their present conjunction.

1439
01:31:03,082 --> 01:31:05,959
Cristal doesn't know
what she's talking about!

1440
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:09,004
-Please.
-She's a charlatan!

1441
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:11,590
We're talking about Cristal Delgiorno.

1442
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:13,884
I need that loan!

1443
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:17,721
-Cristal said...
-I don't care what Cristal said!

1444
01:31:17,805 --> 01:31:19,389
I can't!

1445
01:31:19,474 --> 01:31:21,141
She's a fraud!

1446
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:24,478
Do you hear what you're saying?

1447
01:31:24,562 --> 01:31:27,105
She's a fake fortune teller!

1448
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:30,609
There's no such thing
as predicting the future!

1449
01:31:30,693 --> 01:31:32,235
Are you mad?

1450
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:35,238
You've always been her greatest supporter.

1451
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:38,783
I was only saying those things
just to keep you happy,

1452
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:40,368
to keep you from harming yourself!

1453
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:42,996
She's a blatant, conniving little fraud!

1454
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,789
You sound like your ex.

1455
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:50,086
Darling, I know you've been through
the most horrible breakup.

1456
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,923
I have to have that money.

1457
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:54,007
Not now.

1458
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:56,301
Cristal says no.

1459
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:00,722
You idiot! You poor, pathetic,
gullible imbecile!

1460
01:32:00,806 --> 01:32:03,767
Don't you see? She just tells you
what you want to hear,

1461
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:05,810
and then robs you of your money!

1462
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:08,688
Darling, if I give you the money now,

1463
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:11,983
it would be bad luck, she said,
for you as well as me.

1464
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:14,027
You crazy imbecile!

1465
01:32:14,111 --> 01:32:16,655
I need that loan, you lunatic!

1466
01:32:16,739 --> 01:32:19,115
I'm doing this for your own good.

1467
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:22,619
Cristal has the power of prophecy.

1468
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:28,124
Come on, Henry, wake up, mate.
We know you're faking it.

1469
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:31,127
We really miss you at the poker game, Henry.

1470
01:32:31,837 --> 01:32:34,881
We found a really nice girl for you,
didn't we, lads?

1471
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:38,510
She's right up your street,
she's got the overbite and everything.

1472
01:32:39,011 --> 01:32:41,054
Are you hearing us, Henry?

1473
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:43,557
I know you can hear us.

1474
01:32:44,183 --> 01:32:48,103
If you can understand us, wiggle your fingers

1475
01:32:49,313 --> 01:32:51,898
or make a fist.

1476
01:32:51,983 --> 01:32:54,651
Blink. We'll take anything, right, Roy?

1477
01:32:55,444 --> 01:32:57,279
Listen, Roy's written a book.

1478
01:32:57,363 --> 01:32:59,406
It's about a child pornographer in Belfast.

1479
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:02,492
You want to get yourself well to read it.
It's got bestseller written all over it.

1480
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,077
He's blinking.

1481
01:33:04,161 --> 01:33:06,329
Is he blinking? I can't tell.

1482
01:33:07,164 --> 01:33:09,749
Blink twice if you understand me, Henry.

1483
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:12,961
The doctor said he was optimistic.
Talk to him, Roy.

1484
01:33:13,045 --> 01:33:16,214
Blink if you can hear us, Henry.
Can you hear us?

1485
01:33:18,426 --> 01:33:22,762
He's blinking. It's very faint.
Do it again! See?

1486
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:25,307
-He understands. He definitely understands.
-There.

1487
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:28,810
That head neurologist said it all had to do
with the portion of the brain affected.

1488
01:33:28,894 --> 01:33:31,104
He's convinced
Henry's going to come out of it.

1489
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:32,397
That'd be marvelous.

1490
01:33:32,481 --> 01:33:33,857
Hey, if you've got the time,

1491
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:35,525
you should come in
and read him your new book.

1492
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,611
-Henry.
-I know he can understand.

1493
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:40,405
-Henry!
-Do it again, Henry. Blink again!

1494
01:33:56,422 --> 01:33:59,799
I contacted Claire, put the question to her,

1495
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:01,926
and she said there'd be no problem

1496
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:04,679
if you were to become
the second Mrs. Wunch.

1497
01:34:04,764 --> 01:34:05,764
She said that?

1498
01:34:05,848 --> 01:34:10,101
She rapped twice for no when I asked
if she'd mind if I married you.

1499
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:12,228
You always said
she was an understanding woman.

1500
01:34:12,313 --> 01:34:15,065
I'm not sure she didn't exist once as royalty.

1501
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:18,485
It's so comforting to know
we live over and over again.

1502
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:21,237
If only I could convince Alfie,
he'd be so much happier.

1503
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:22,322
Yes.

1504
01:34:22,406 --> 01:34:26,826
It's time to close the book on our little tale
of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

1505
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:33,333
And one has to wonder,
given all of life's uncertainty and pain,

1506
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:35,418
how do we get through it?

1507
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:38,254
Well, as Sally told Roy,

1508
01:34:38,339 --> 01:34:41,466
sometimes the illusions
work better than the medicine.

1509
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:44,803
I was a peasant, just a simple peasant,

1510
01:34:44,887 --> 01:34:49,015
but you, you were something very special.

1511
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:54,688
Sometimes my intuition makes me think
that you might have lived before

1512
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:57,273
as Cleopatra or Joan ofArc.

1513
01:34:58,776 --> 01:35:01,820
Cristal Delgiorno's confirmed
that I lived before,

1514
01:35:01,904 --> 01:35:05,198
and I've always had a particular fondness
for everything French.

1515
01:35:05,282 --> 01:35:09,119
So, I'm inclined to think
you may be right about Joan ofArc.

1516
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:11,621
Sometimes I have memories of my past lives.

1517
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:13,081
Do you?

1518
01:35:13,165 --> 01:35:15,792
I do. Yes.

1519
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:17,252
In France.
