You...

Hello, Henry.

10
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:10,768
You can not talk,

11
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:11,969
But it is normal.

12
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:17,321
No, it's not normal,
but temporary, okay?

13
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:22,664
Do you remember how you got here?

14
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:27,493
Okay.

15
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,195
It is also normal.

16
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:34,849
Henry, wait.

17
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:36,414
Wait.

18
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:38,996
Be patient.

19
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,239

24
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:04,127
The following can hurt.

25
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:05,709
This time too.

26
00:06:06,747 --> 00:06:08,992
But it will not last long, I promise.

27
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:18,609
Almost we have done.

28
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:21,907
Soldadora.

29
00:06:40,085 --> 00:06:41,165
I can do it.

30
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:48,169
Wonderful  Henry.

31
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:52,579

00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:55,721
Stronger.

33
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:58,833
Great, right?

34
00:06:59,814 --> 00:07:00,814
Integument.

35
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:16,011
Please do not shake your hand.

36
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:20,773
You probably do not remember.

37
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:23,572
You were never fan of my work.

38
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:27,028
Perhaps this will make you change your mind.

39
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:29,328
Right?

40
00:07:32,472 --> 00:07:33,855
Memory is a funny thing.

41
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:37,553
I am an expert and I do not know if some day recover
yours.

42
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:47,392
You do not remember me at all,
is not it Henry?

43
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:53,662
My name is Estelle.

44
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,353
You and I were...

45
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,742
We are still...

46
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:07,634
Husband and wife.

47
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,057
I love you Henry.

48
00:08:29,065 --> 00:08:30,772
I can not wait to hear you say it.

49
00:08:41,297 --> 00:08:42,297
Henry.

50
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,266
Still he is trying to regain his memories.

51
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:46,085
Oh God.

52
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:48,308
I'm Robbie.

53
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,495

54
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,665
This you'll love.

55
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,380
Because, sir...

56
00:08:57,258 --> 00:09:00,907
You get to choose your own voice.

57
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,845
<i>Thank you. Thank you very much.</i>

58
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:06,842
<i>Hello Henry.</i>

59
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:08,504
- Robbie.
- Come on, are options.

60
00:09:08,705 --> 00:09:10,912
What white man would not hear
as Louis Armstrong?

61
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:12,104
Just one more, wait.

62
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:15,302
<i>Henry, I am your father.</i>

63
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:16,523
<i>Robert  enough.</i>

64
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:19,322
- Sorry mom.
- What if we use Henry's voice?

65
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:20,881
Yes, whatever you say, you're the boss
.

66
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:21,882
Boring.

67
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:23,991
- Security compromised.
- Fuck.

68
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:26,454
- Level Four.
- Is it a sham?

69
00:09:26,755 --> 00:09:29,197
- What?
- Committed Safety Level Four.

70
00:09:29,397 --> 00:09:30,961
- Close the door.
- It's probably a mistake.

71
00:09:31,162 --> 00:09:34,132
- Estelle, call the base.
- Committed Safety Level Four.

72
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:44,984
Clear.

73
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:47,309
Clear.

74
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:54,775
Oh, no.

75
00:09:59,037 --> 00:10:00,120
Yes.

76
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,335
Thank you.

77
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,237
Get up.

78
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,409
Henry, right?

79
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,510
Please.

80
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:14,710
- Shut up.
- No...

81
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,832
What do you think the new you?

82
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:22,240
I interrupted the procedure?

83
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:24,511
Still can not speak Henry?

84
00:10:26,354 --> 00:10:27,643
You can not, no.

85
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:29,631
Not see me and Henry.

86
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,956
You may have rebuilt your girlfriend,

87
00:10:34,257 --> 00:10:37,071
But I gave the matter
premium to do so.

88
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:41,989
And I mean I gave all
the raw material.

89
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:44,458
- What is your name?
- Timothy.

90
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:45,866
Nice to meet Timothy.

91
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,801
Did you see when Estelle
Henry brought his remains here?

92
00:10:50,156 --> 00:10:51,157
Yes.

93
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:53,659
Are you so kind to describe
Henry

94
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:58,251
Better understand how well you see now?

95
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:03,815
Sure. His arm was ripped a shot
below the elbow...

96
00:11:04,017 --> 00:11:07,198
And they ripped a shot
leg below the knee.

97
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,393
- And there was a dent as a ball...
- Do you happen to see your head?

98
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,561
Yes.

99
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:14,161
Tell us.

100
00:11:16,473 --> 00:11:18,445
The skull was dented and there was a...

101
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,544
She had no eyes and...

102
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:25,362
The bottom of his jaw was shattered
.

103
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:28,635
It is correct.

104
00:11:38,224 --> 00:11:39,325
I'm bleeding too.

105
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:41,027
That was exhausting.

106
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:44,383
Stay close.

107
00:11:47,895 --> 00:11:49,868
Henry! Hurry up! Hurry up!

108
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,483
Close it.

109
00:12:02,277 --> 00:12:03,277
Henry, come on!

110
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,918
Henry, faster!

111
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:13,076
Come on.

112
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:17,158
Kick it.

113
00:12:18,384 --> 00:12:19,397
Come on.

114
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:21,444
If Akan takes over my job,

115
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:24,799
Men like these will be revived
to form his army.

116
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:29,043
Go!

117
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:31,109

120
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:39,039
Take my hand!

<i>Capsule exhaust  activated.</i>

122
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:48,426
There are two capsules.

00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:50,152
- A.
- Marty?

124
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,872
Sorry, man
obviously went crazy.

125
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,344
Marty, no!

126
00:12:57,421 --> 00:12:58,421
Henry.

127
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:01,592
- It's yours, come in.
- Estelle!

128
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:03,434
Come in, come in!

00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:41,873
Open the parachute!

133
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,867
It's going too fast!
It's going too fast!

134
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,680
Sotente, Henry!

135
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:20,429
Oh God.

136
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,088
Mercenaries Akan.

137
00:14:22,189 --> 00:14:23,190
Me down.

138
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,590
Me down.

139
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:28,211
Henry.

140
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:32,794
You underestimate, okay?

141
00:14:32,995 --> 00:14:34,400
Let them come and attack them.

142
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:39,443
Akan, is also weak
a piece of shit.

143
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:40,644
Attacks!

144
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:44,301
No, Henry!

145
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:45,502
Defend yourself!

146
00:14:45,904 --> 00:14:46,904
Come on!

147
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,404
The groom is not a killing machine...

148
00:14:49,561 --> 00:14:51,832
- Henry!
-... What did you expect?

149
00:14:54,857 --> 00:14:57,370
But you you built a good sack of boxing.

150
00:14:57,571 --> 00:14:58,774
Stop!

151
00:14:58,976 --> 00:14:59,976
- Stop!
- What?

152
00:15:00,076 --> 00:15:01,761
- Stop!
- Estelle...

153
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:05,404
Are not you curious what this motherfucker,

154
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,682
You going to do this motherfucker?

155
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:10,965
Henry!

156
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,449
You're like a fucking scared rabbit. true?

157
00:18:02,409 --> 00:18:04,592
Okay, I'm not going to hurt.

158
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:07,245
Voice module you have installed?

159
00:18:09,581 --> 00:18:10,646
Shit.

160
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,221
Well, at least we know you're not deaf.

161
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:17,396
Right, you can now put your hands down.

162
00:18:18,008 --> 00:18:21,611
I have waited for this moment three years
and I get the damn Charlie Chaplin.

163
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:23,483
Shit! Come on!

164
00:18:26,556 --> 00:18:28,337
Well, let's take a look.

165
00:18:28,938 --> 00:18:30,515
Open the glove please.

166
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:33,485
Get that device.

167
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:36,194
You must untangle the cables.

168
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:38,567
Is a wedding ring?

169
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:41,941
Are you...? You are married?

170
00:18:43,592 --> 00:18:45,084
How you doing with that?

171
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:48,772
Yes, what a surprise.

172
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:51,176
Good. Now I need you...

173
00:18:51,376 --> 00:18:52,898
Take off your shirt, please.

174
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,467
Open there.

175
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,791
Yes, those.

176
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:57,846
Connect the cables there.

177
00:18:57,847 --> 00:18:59,046
Yes, there.

178
00:19:00,378 --> 00:19:02,961
So your name is Henry and...

179
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:07,006
Well, the good news is that you
to live for a while.

180
00:19:07,607 --> 00:19:10,087
Bad news is that in this case,

181
00:19:10,288 --> 00:19:14,616
A while means 20, 30
minutes max. Henry.

182
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:16,995
Unless you have very, very lucky
.

183
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,159
And you have it.

184
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,332
Uncle Jimmy will take you to his lab.

185
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:24,533
Resists.

186
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,119
Shit.

There are no clothes. Ponte sweatshirt.

189
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,605
No time, fuck.
Only cover your blood with the bag.

190
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:43,668
Be quiet and let me
handle this, okay?

191
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:51,079
Perhaps we can proceed directly to the fine
?

192
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:53,198
So...

193
00:19:58,323 --> 00:19:59,323
Shit.

194
00:20:02,673 --> 00:20:04,406
Cursed  Akan, bribing...

195
00:22:20,723 --> 00:22:24,222
Do you know what is wrong with Mother Russia?

196
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,129
Too hot.

197
00:22:30,387 --> 00:22:32,193
Too hot.

198
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,748
Too hot.

199
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,333
Whatever.

200
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:48,129
I used to be in charge of all this.
And now...

201
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:54,162
I'll have to hurt Henry,
but it's for your own good, pal.

202
00:22:54,361 --> 00:22:55,574
Just give me your arm... Hey!

203
00:22:55,776 --> 00:22:56,776
Shit!

204
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,885
I! I'm Jimmy.

205
00:22:59,553 --> 00:23:02,315
We have little time before that we rediscover friend.

206
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,500
Just... good. Just give me your arm.

207
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:06,378
Well, just relax.

208
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:09,268
Here it is.

209
00:23:09,769 --> 00:23:11,019
Here it is.

210
00:23:12,837 --> 00:23:13,935
Bingo!

211
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:20,169
With this bloody  you have been tracking.

212
00:23:21,408 --> 00:23:22,416
Goodbye.

213
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:27,286
In a few moments your mechanical parts
begin to fade.

214
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:32,705
Your friend has a contact Akan
important in Russia Dimitry called Slick.

215
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:36,824
Slick is responsible for the police, guns,

216
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:39,858
Properties and many other things Akan

217
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:44,637
This point on the map

218
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:47,372
It is the house of Slick.

219
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,629
All you have to do is go in there
,

220
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:55,130
Kill him, open his ribcage.

221
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:58,500
Take your beating heart...

222
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:01,464
And I eat it.

223
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:04,747
I'm kidding!

224
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,028
I'm kidding, you have to eat your heart
.

225
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,340
Under
his heart is his power pumper. whether?

226
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:13,318
Bring it to me.

227
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:16,555
Use this and will contact you this.

228
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:21,371
That must be the most
gay jacket I've ever seen.

229
00:24:24,135 --> 00:24:26,905
What good jacket!
Can you get me one?

230
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:01,015
I'll be in touch!

231
00:25:57,115 --> 00:25:58,198
You!

232
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,493
Come here!

233
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,657
Have lighter?

234
00:26:06,808 --> 00:26:08,493
Why do you think I have arms?

235
00:26:10,532 --> 00:26:12,049
You can go.

236
00:27:02,222 --> 00:27:03,672
You want a smoke?

237
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:04,873
Yes.

238
00:29:21,903 --> 00:29:22,903
<i>Henry.</i>

239
00:29:23,073 --> 00:29:24,274
<i>Akan already begun.</i>

240
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:27,048
<i>If we do not stop, will have its army
days or sooner.</i>

241
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,766
You half-machine, half a fag.

242
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:13,414
Wait, wait.

243
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:17,346
I tell you something very important
about the man who sent you here.

244
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,015
<i>Hello Henry.
I am in a very classy establishment.</i>

245
00:34:03,216 --> 00:34:05,633
<i>Follow
point and then touches the touch doors.</i>

246
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:07,284
<i>Do you understand? The knock on doors!</i>

247
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,285
She .

248
00:34:33,886 --> 00:34:35,872
She, bitch.

249
00:34:39,818 --> 00:34:41,264
Take it to Jimmy.

250
00:34:57,454 --> 00:34:59,132
He is Jimmy?

251
00:35:01,426 --> 00:35:02,476
Hello.

252
00:35:02,677 --> 00:35:04,537
I'm a car, baby.

253
00:35:04,738 --> 00:35:05,922
A Lexus convertible!

254
00:35:15,143 --> 00:35:18,466
I will not go back there!
That thing is a destroyer class!

255
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:24,096
It feels good.

256
00:35:24,297 --> 00:35:25,497
Yes, yes.

257
00:35:27,848 --> 00:35:29,715
God this is amazing. If!

258
00:35:31,793 --> 00:35:33,009
Damn, you're late!

259
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:34,324
You're late!

260
00:35:37,863 --> 00:35:40,631
The last 15 minutes

261
00:35:40,832 --> 00:35:44,403
They have been a roller coaster of emotions
.

262
00:35:45,782 --> 00:35:47,355
I did not know if I would see.

263
00:35:48,657 --> 00:35:50,217
So I lit some of this.

264
00:35:50,903 --> 00:35:52,543
I turned on my nerves damn you, you know?

265
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,474
There you have it.

266
00:35:59,606 --> 00:36:01,528
Okay. Only you lost energy.

267
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:02,529
Come on.

268
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,831
Hey, Bring me a bit
of this strong Russian thing, girls.

269
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:06,675
Well, where is the pumper is?

270
00:36:06,877 --> 00:36:09,237
Where you are...? You got it?
Did you get the goddamn...?

271
00:36:10,247 --> 00:36:11,922
Yes! Very good!

272
00:36:12,122 --> 00:36:13,605
Is this, is this, yes?

273
00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:15,208
Well, wait.

274
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:17,110
Well, hold this woman.

275
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:18,803
Shit.

276
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:23,496
Well, I must get this damn
there.

277
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,310
Who do I cheat?
I am not able to do this.

278
00:36:28,964 --> 00:36:30,781
I'm sorry, I'm not able to do
friend.

279
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:31,982
I'm not able.

280
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,243
Sorry,
I'm not able to do so.

281
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,729
What happens to your hand?

282
00:36:44,149 --> 00:36:47,234
What is it? A robot?

283
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,774
's Handsome.

284
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:55,057
I know how to make him feel better.

285
00:37:06,251 --> 00:37:07,889
No, I know a better way.

286
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,237
Lavántalo.

287
00:37:15,828 --> 00:37:16,829
Oh, God.

288
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:18,500
Oh, God, what have they done?

289
00:37:18,701 --> 00:37:20,169
What have you done this time, Jimmy?

290
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,840
Are you still conscious?

291
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:24,771
Yes. Hi.

292
00:37:25,213 --> 00:37:26,289
You'll be fine.

293
00:37:26,682 --> 00:37:29,027
We just have to charge you a little.

294
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:32,002
Girls, give us space, please?

295
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:33,410
Thank you.

296
00:37:36,344 --> 00:37:37,679
You are very important, you know?

297
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:41,358
You're not the only one hurt by Akan.

298
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,630
You and I want the same thing.

299
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:45,387
This may hurt a little.

300
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:48,745
Here we go.

301
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:51,303
It's wonderful.

302
00:37:52,064 --> 00:37:53,984
Now I can take back to my lab.

303
00:37:54,554 --> 00:37:56,018
I'm Jimmy, by the way.

304
00:37:56,493 --> 00:37:59,668
I understand that all this is very confusing for you
.

305
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:01,349
But... but...

306
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:03,723
It's better if I show
in the laboratory. whether?

307

00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:09,135

I can not... I can not let them see me like

312
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:16,588
I can not... I'm sorry.

313
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,340
No... I can not stay here Henry.

314
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:19,937
Sorry.

315
00:38:23,032 --> 00:38:24,173
Demons.

316
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:30,965
Yes!

317
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,663
Yes, well, his men are here.
I'll face them, okay?

318
00:38:34,864 --> 00:38:36,132
I'll face them, okay?

319
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,893
There are more weapons in the drawer for you, yes?

320
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:41,504
This is war, baby. If!

321
00:38:43,373 --> 00:38:44,387
Oh yeah!

322
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:45,711
Hello girls!

Goodbye.

325
00:39:34,337 --> 00:39:35,647
Already had it!

326
00:39:41,649 --> 00:39:42,901
I'm not with them!

327
00:39:43,602 --> 00:39:44,635
I'm not with them!

328
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:47,317
Come on, come on!

329
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:57,884
Run, run, run!

330
00:40:13,402 --> 00:40:15,324
The floor is lava!

331
00:40:15,525 --> 00:40:17,757
I'll burn this...
Hey, Katya!

332
00:40:18,386 --> 00:40:20,213
Jimmy, you're a jerk!

333
00:40:31,501 --> 00:40:33,175
Please, please!

334
00:40:33,477 --> 00:40:35,212
Please do not hurt me.

335
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:37,033
I have family.

336
00:40:37,406 --> 00:40:38,638
Is she your wife?

337
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:48,093
Do not worry about it Henry.

338
00:40:48,495 --> 00:40:50,243
She mourns her dead husband.

339
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:54,414
I was not sure you'd see.

340
00:40:55,345 --> 00:40:57,414
Your perseverance is incomparable.

341
00:40:58,113 --> 00:40:59,406
And very exciting.

342
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:03,630
Services Slick Dimitry
were excellent.

343
00:41:05,177 --> 00:41:07,335
I'm glad not to have paid in advance.

344
00:41:09,165 --> 00:41:10,702
I'll tell Estelle you did it right.

345
00:41:11,592 --> 00:41:12,597
<i>Akan!</i>

346
00:41:12,598 --> 00:41:15,090
<i>Akan, open the damn door
Do you hear me?</i>

347
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:18,034
Is arranged very nice in the
back of my truck down.

348
00:41:18,234 --> 00:41:20,003
<i>I'll rip your lungs!</i>

349
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:28,828
Go far Henry, unlike
of this motherfucker.

350
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:01,311
Hi Henry, put the gun down.

351
00:42:01,863 --> 00:42:02,964
Okay.

352
00:42:05,037 --> 00:42:06,326
Hey, hey, hey.

353
00:42:06,528 --> 00:42:07,727
In peace, in peace.

354
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:09,704
Relax, calm down.

355
00:42:11,389 --> 00:42:13,329
As I shared something with you.

356
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,661
I need to share something with me.

357
00:42:18,172 --> 00:42:19,684
Where will Akan?

358
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,193
Do you want to Akan?

359
00:42:28,116 --> 00:42:29,745
Here's your Akan.

360
00:42:31,506 --> 00:42:33,489
- Fuck, Shit.
- And here's your Akan.

361
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:40,881
That's my ego talking to you.

362
00:42:47,076 --> 00:42:50,599
What do you want?
To be better? Ego?

363
00:42:51,811 --> 00:42:54,635
Be superior? Ego?

364
00:42:54,936 --> 00:42:56,614
- Be...
- Being superior!

365
00:42:56,814 --> 00:42:59,236
Higher, yes. It's okay.

366
00:42:59,437 --> 00:43:02,734
The escort
Akan is taking the girl to his base.

367
00:43:03,856 --> 00:43:06,320
Shit. I got this,
I got it.

368
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:07,704
What have you done?

369
00:43:07,905 --> 00:43:09,342
- All of our dead girls!
- Well girls.

370
00:43:09,544 --> 00:43:10,544
- Well?
- It's okay.

371
00:43:10,744 --> 00:43:11,744
- Okay, just...
- It's not right!

372
00:43:11,946 --> 00:43:12,945
- Who were those guys?
- What do you mean, right?

373
00:43:13,146 --> 00:43:15,370
- What do you mean, right?
- He is telling us to relax?

374
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:18,211
- Henry? Who is Henry?
- You saw what happened up there?

375
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,668
- Sorry you are upset, okay?
- What are you watching?

376
00:43:19,876 --> 00:43:21,972
Henry and I are going to take care of Akan.

377
00:43:22,173 --> 00:43:23,729
- Henry? Who is Henry?
- You saw what happened up there?

378
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:25,007
- Did you see what you did?
- You're an Idiot!

379
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:26,272
- We'll go with you to destroy them!
- That fag white hair is dead.

380
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:28,066
Okay, come on. You want a bike?
Can go on a motorcycle.

381
00:43:28,267 --> 00:43:29,598
Just... just...
Yes. You want to go?

382
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,729
- Well, go on your bike, go on your bike.
- We have our own bikes.

383
00:43:31,931 --> 00:43:32,964
Bloody hell.

384
00:43:33,386 --> 00:43:35,439
Sometimes it is easier to say yes.

385
00:44:27,076 --> 00:44:28,540
Henry, catch it!

386
00:46:03,283 --> 00:46:05,323
God. I thought I'd lost forever
Henry.

387
00:46:05,613 --> 00:46:06,613
I was very scared.

388
00:46:06,814 --> 00:46:08,559
I was very scared when you fell.

389
00:46:09,555 --> 00:46:11,038
I thought I would never see.

390
00:46:15,267 --> 00:46:16,646
I love you Henry.

391
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,254
I love you.

392
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:23,610
<i>How sweet.</i>

393
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:26,919
<i>If I took this picture and put it
in a cup of tea.</i>

394
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,610
<i>Would not need sugar.</i>

395
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:31,432
<i>Yuri, please.</i>

396
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,240
Now we can move forward.

397
00:46:59,668 --> 00:47:03,796
Every year thousand
baseball bats are sold in Russia

398
00:47:03,997 --> 00:47:06,493
And at most, 50 baseballs.

399
00:47:06,786 --> 00:47:09,977
Do you get an idea of the great Russian pastime?

400
00:47:11,084 --> 00:47:14,933
This is a rare bat that survived.

401
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:16,135
Estelle.

402
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:20,680
Could you be so kind
to stop you please?

403
00:47:24,269 --> 00:47:25,313
No.

404
00:47:26,868 --> 00:47:28,765
Or you want to take your place?

405
00:47:29,693 --> 00:47:33,210
Estelle, your man is all
a knight in armor.

406
00:47:33,411 --> 00:47:35,494
He is sacrificing himself to stay alive.

407
00:47:36,195 --> 00:47:42,169
Just to make my penis kill you later.

408
00:47:43,638 --> 00:47:44,830
Are you sure, Henry?

409
00:47:46,225 --> 00:47:47,876
Are you sure?

410
00:47:49,307 --> 00:47:50,841
I did not hear a "no".

411
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,041
Excellent!

412
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:54,909
Come here  Henry.

413
00:47:56,002 --> 00:47:57,606
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon Henry.

414
00:48:23,008 --> 00:48:24,008
<i>You...</i>

415
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:26,666
<i>Small...</i>

416
00:48:27,728 --> 00:48:28,728
<i>Coward.</i>

417
00:48:49,081 --> 00:48:50,881
Knights please go take a look.

418
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,049
Stop!

419
00:48:54,081 --> 00:48:56,264
Give a chance to peace brothers.

420
00:48:56,674 --> 00:48:59,598
My ego wants to kill my
but not supreme being.

421
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:01,543
My God, baby.

422
00:49:01,744 --> 00:49:03,435
She was talking to the man.

423
00:49:04,935 --> 00:49:05,935
Demons.

424
00:49:21,052 --> 00:49:22,105
Look at this.

425
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:24,252
The guy has a lock on the memory.

426
00:49:25,664 --> 00:49:28,112
Well, that's all I
I can do for you, friend.

427
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:30,100
Restart time.

428
00:49:30,202 --> 00:49:33,287
See you in 15 minutes, I hope.

429
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:53,050
Hey.

430
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,698
's Awake.

431
00:49:55,207 --> 00:49:57,177
You might see a blur.

432
00:49:58,296 --> 00:50:02,213
It's just your depth perception
trying calibrated, okay?

433
00:50:03,218 --> 00:50:04,934
Follow me as I walk, okay?

434
00:50:06,507 --> 00:50:07,507
Stand.

435
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:09,847

436
00:50:10,222 --> 00:50:11,222
Good.

437
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:16,137
Now, you can focus being here?

438
00:50:16,338 --> 00:50:17,572
- Yes?
- Yes

439
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:19,824
Bury you...

440
00:50:20,025 --> 00:50:21,909
It is like burying a treasure.

441
00:50:23,048 --> 00:50:27,438
Not really understand what
Akan think because...

442
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:55,768
<i>Henry, stop playing.</i>

443
00:52:55,969 --> 00:52:57,139
<i>You're almost there, buddy.</i>

444
00:52:57,864 --> 00:52:59,148
<i>This is where you must go.</i>

445
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,250
<i>Hasten.</i>

446
00:53:48,627 --> 00:53:50,480
's Me, Jimmy.

447
00:53:50,781 --> 00:53:51,863
Walking.

448
00:54:01,641 --> 00:54:02,739
Shit.

449
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,431
These pigs are here again.

450
00:54:11,827 --> 00:54:14,694
Do not put at risk my lab.

451
00:54:17,765 --> 00:54:18,765
Let go.

452
00:54:19,066 --> 00:54:23,325
Baby, Bowing reflect
is psychological. It is only in your head.

453
00:54:24,366 --> 00:54:25,608
Henry, no.

454
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:27,703
I'm telling you... shit.

455
00:54:55,983 --> 00:54:57,043
Go.

456
00:54:59,275 --> 00:55:00,907
Good job Charlie Bronson.

457
00:55:13,718 --> 00:55:15,603
Bravo 2-0.

458

459
00:55:42,198 --> 00:55:43,282
Plays the video.

<i>Dawn twilight...

00:55:48,955 --> 00:55:50,170
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

462
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:53,105
<i>I made lobotomy to all the essentials</i>

463
00:55:54,737 --> 00:55:56,679
<i>Nonessentials for a soldier.</i>

464
00:55:56,881 --> 00:55:59,698
<i>Personal Recollections, speech, taste
, I removed everything.</i>

465
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:03,888
<i>You may still be a problem with emotional
motivation, which...</i>

466
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:05,090
<i>Motivation?</i>

467
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,919
<i>What do you think your damned salary, James?</i>

468
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,127
<i>My salary...</i>

469
00:56:10,628 --> 00:56:11,999
<i>Yes, okay.</i>

470
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,125
<i>What the hell, James?</i>

471
00:56:25,326 --> 00:56:26,801
<i>I'm sorry, sir. I am so sorry.</i>

472
00:56:27,102 --> 00:56:28,846
<i>Hell, open the door.</i>

473
00:56:29,048 --> 00:56:30,724
<i>Please open the door.</i>

474
00:56:30,825 --> 00:56:32,776
<i>We have a fault.
Let me out, please.</i>

475
00:56:32,977 --> 00:56:33,980
<i>I'll fix it.</i>

476
00:56:34,081 --> 00:56:35,287
<i>I doubt it.</i>

477
00:56:40,144 --> 00:56:41,373
<i>Damn idiot.</i>

478
00:56:44,851 --> 00:56:48,377
<i>You know Jimmy?
there is something about breaking a bad back...</i>

479
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:51,274
<i>That never gets old.</i>

480
00:56:52,561 --> 00:56:55,638
- It sounds like...
- The end, the beginning.

481
00:56:56,108 --> 00:56:57,670
Or the same?

482
00:56:58,413 --> 00:56:59,669
Sit  Henry.

483
00:57:00,785 --> 00:57:04,689
When a man is disabled,
all have the same question in mind,

484
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,956
Especially in his.

485
00:57:08,348 --> 00:57:09,513
Does the penis works?

486
00:57:12,076 --> 00:57:16,323
Mine did not, so I planned my escape
of this chair.

487
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:18,423
I came to Russia when
in the West,

488
00:57:18,626 --> 00:57:21,202
Banned resuscitation of dead tissue.

489
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:25,145
Akan is a megatómano,
but my research had funds.

490
00:57:25,548 --> 00:57:28,566
He looks at the Nobel Prize.

491
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:33,112
Who has time for ethics
revolting when you're rich and your penis work?

492
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,899
I paid a high price.

493
00:57:38,898 --> 00:57:42,715
I stopped doing
soldiers and then I succeeded.

494
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,755
Cultivé cyber-skin men.

495
00:57:46,055 --> 00:57:47,895
Mainly, are only
sophisticated prostheses

496
00:57:48,017 --> 00:57:49,337
But do not you dare tell...

497
00:57:49,487 --> 00:57:50,793
My avatars!

498
00:57:51,942 --> 00:57:56,409
Now, cyborgs on the other side have
pieces and a brain.

499
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:59,674
Think for themselves, at least in theory
.

500
00:57:59,975 --> 00:58:01,051
Do you take a look?

501
00:58:03,527 --> 00:58:05,841
That hippie, always smoking weed.

502
00:58:06,345 --> 00:58:08,013
- NEW DEPOSIT LINKED
- You're not drugged, right?

503
00:58:08,214 --> 00:58:09,218
I hope not.

504
00:58:10,013 --> 00:58:11,016
Good.

505
00:58:13,429 --> 00:58:15,936
You are an amazing man, Henry.

506
00:58:15,937 --> 00:58:16,941
Is very little.

507
00:58:17,774 --> 00:58:20,828
There is very little real man,
of course.

508
00:58:22,156 --> 00:58:24,574
Skeletal system, muscles improved
,

509
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:28,578
Cardiovascular driven by an atomic battery curio 224.

00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,462
A good night's sleep and could
to power an aircraft carrier.

511
00:58:35,128 --> 00:58:37,162
Outstanding technology, do not you think?

512
00:58:39,602 --> 00:58:41,117
- Starting...
- You do not.

513
00:58:41,833 --> 00:58:43,000
My boys.

514
00:58:43,303 --> 00:58:45,422
I made the first revenge.

515
00:58:45,624 --> 00:58:48,702
But then I began to explore
new aspects of myself.

516
00:58:49,003 --> 00:58:50,108
Can I have a drink?

517
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,910
I have lived these last years, Henry.

518
00:58:56,414 --> 00:59:01,006
My boys, receive
fines for excess speed, walk barefoot in the grass.

519
00:59:01,209 --> 00:59:03,596
And what they have lots of sex.

520
00:59:05,413 --> 00:59:09,044
You never guess what we do
here alone.

521
00:59:10,503 --> 00:59:12,078
Press "play" there.

522
00:59:12,453 --> 00:59:13,453

Close your eyes.

Do not worry, not gonorrhea or anything.

I just have to sit in this chair
and have a look, shall we?

530

The scanner says you're in great danger.

Akan will not.

549
01:02:26,878 --> 01:02:31,883
I will live in this straitjacket
rotten and disgusting skin.

01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:48,821
Fuck you too,
but mainly thanks.

554
01:02:50,486 --> 01:02:51,839
My lab is in danger,

555
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:54,900
But I can build a new one using
Akan equipment...

556
01:02:55,641 --> 01:03:00,129
When we come together for your wife. agree?

557
01:03:05,841 --> 01:03:06,843
Put that on the wall.

558
01:03:07,043 --> 01:03:10,208
If I can not have my lab
no one will.

559
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:12,772
Now, do not miss this.

560
01:03:15,763 --> 01:03:18,773
Fuck you Akan.

561
01:03:19,987 --> 01:03:21,423
Do not change the channel.

562
01:03:21,624 --> 01:03:23,381
We are on the way.

563
01:03:41,686 --> 01:03:44,116
Well, I counted six vehicles.

564
01:03:44,522 --> 01:03:46,111
That's at least 35 men.

565
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:49,094
We have to reduce by half
before entering the hotel...

566
01:03:49,494 --> 01:03:51,734
To give us the opportunity to fight and get out alive.

567
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:55,197
There are also certain stigma,

568
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:57,638
Associated
subjects who likes music.

569
01:03:57,723 --> 01:04:00,637
I just want to leave now clear
I'm a macho man.

570
01:04:01,461 --> 01:04:02,461
Understand?

571
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:04,061
Here they come.

572
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:12,900
Wait.

573
01:04:14,176 --> 01:04:15,492
Wait.

574
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,161
Now.

575
01:04:26,899 --> 01:04:28,863
Well, cover me.

576
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:53,002
Yes!

577
01:04:56,512 --> 01:04:58,548
Shit, are in the hotel.

578
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:01,010
We no longer need sniper rifle
either.

579
01:05:01,493 --> 01:05:03,644
Enters, looking the colonel.

580
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:13,676
Over here, amigo.

581
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:15,161
Arm yourself to the teeth.

582
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,420
Do not touch that. Emma Gee is mine.

583
01:05:20,046 --> 01:05:21,356
As my father used to say

584
01:05:21,756 --> 01:05:23,916
"A Granada
day keeps the enemy in his lair."

585
01:05:24,266 --> 01:05:25,540
Come on.

586
01:05:25,941 --> 01:05:26,941
Faster.

587
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,058
The great Sally.

588
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:38,493
Well, home is where the battle is.

589
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:49,339
Well, soldier, it is our duty to ensure
that nothing happens to invalid, understand?

590
01:05:50,956 --> 01:05:51,957
Continue.

591
01:06:08,406 --> 01:06:10,420
Yes you can hear them but you can not shoot
,

592
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:13,721
You can probably throwing one Granada.
Strip an egg down there, friend.

593
01:06:20,215 --> 01:06:21,275
Avancemos.

594
01:06:24,954 --> 01:06:25,990
Come on.

595
01:06:26,538 --> 01:06:28,559
My God, how embarrassing.

596
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,351
Dodged a bullet.

597
01:06:42,554 --> 01:06:43,663
You cover.

598
01:06:43,889 --> 01:06:45,135
Surround them.

599
01:07:09,165 --> 01:07:12,022
Do not let
is invalid under you!

600
01:08:52,154 --> 01:08:53,157
Okay.

601
01:08:59,914 --> 01:09:01,883
Wait. Help me with the disabled.

602
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:15,970
Back five steps when you order.

603
01:09:20,544 --> 01:09:23,950
Disabled  A place for a crippled man.

604
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:26,049
Thank you, Yuri.

605
01:09:26,223 --> 01:09:29,198
My headquarters is up.

606
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:31,252
Would you like to see?

607
01:09:31,406 --> 01:09:32,690
We'll see.

608
01:09:32,891 --> 01:09:33,891
I think so.

609
01:09:52,953 --> 01:09:54,513
Do not waste horsepower.

610
01:10:02,363 --> 01:10:03,670
Take the next exit.

611
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:05,305
Over there, that's right.

612
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:16,099
Friend's turn off the engines.

613
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,034
Cambiémosles plans these guys.

614
01:10:25,356 --> 01:10:26,518
A load.

615
01:10:39,849 --> 01:10:40,906
Big Ben.

616
01:11:04,104 --> 01:11:05,953
Akan is a jerk!
<font color=#0000FF>ENGLISH SUBTITLE BY :

617
01:11:18,113 --> 01:11:19,227
My God.

618
01:11:20,023 --> 01:11:21,880
Akan seems already begun.

619
01:11:23,278 --> 01:11:27,698
Tomorrow these poor guys will
robotic super soldiers like you.

620
01:11:28,294 --> 01:11:29,294
Beware!

621
01:11:48,413 --> 01:11:51,287
What it is red and bad for your teeth?

622
01:11:55,049 --> 01:11:56,360
Lavántate friend.

623
01:12:00,451 --> 01:12:01,574
To your left.

624
01:12:12,448 --> 01:12:14,103
I'll buy you some time.

625
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,223
Seal the door.

626
01:12:26,078 --> 01:12:30,908
I can not tell you how many times I dreamed
be going up this elevator.

627
01:12:33,067 --> 01:12:34,349
It is a pity that can not...

628
01:12:37,692 --> 01:12:39,172
It's just a landing gear, friend.

629
01:12:39,702 --> 01:12:41,718
Now, listen to me.

630
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:43,504
When you kill Akan

631
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:46,916
I want you to see him straight in the eye
until the rest of it...

632
01:12:47,217 --> 01:12:49,474
Is so dead like them,
you understand?

633
01:12:52,057 --> 01:12:55,670
Now, I'm afraid I will not go with you.

634
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:57,971
But you have allowed me to bring you this far,

635
01:12:58,231 --> 01:13:01,938
Been given an old
his greatest gift...

636
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:03,336
In all his years.

637
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:08,383
No.

638
01:13:08,495 --> 01:13:11,034
Is fixed at its jugular.

639
01:13:12,033 --> 01:13:14,800
If not be able to retire...

640
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,965
The... the thing in your pocket fast.

641
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,454
I'm afraid I must confess something.

642
01:13:25,455 --> 01:13:27,997
You see, I've been watching for years Akan.

643
01:13:28,297 --> 01:13:33,670
So when you fell that road
and you revealed so splendidly,

644
01:13:33,971 --> 01:13:36,523
All I saw was my chance for revenge
.

645
01:13:36,624 --> 01:13:40,354
You gave me reason with Dimitry,
but then in the forest...

646
01:13:40,754 --> 01:13:42,611
I noticed an implant.

647
01:13:45,837 --> 01:13:48,249
A blockage in your memory, see?

648
01:13:48,749 --> 01:13:50,778
And I could not afford,

649
01:13:50,779 --> 01:13:54,193
You to remember a better life elsewhere, so...

650
01:13:54,394 --> 01:13:55,699
I left there.

651
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,192
It's not something that I take pride, I'm afraid.

652
01:14:00,433 --> 01:14:03,247
Then in my labortorio,

653
01:14:03,448 --> 01:14:08,571
When he tried to analyze what you could do for me.

654
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:10,916
I realized...

655
01:14:11,915 --> 01:14:16,877
Who you are to me, Henry.

656
01:14:24,699 --> 01:14:27,524
It's very nice to have a friend. Henry.

657
01:14:32,887 --> 01:14:38,603
'll Think that all the deaths
I would have prepared for this.

658
01:14:40,584 --> 01:14:42,320
If you have not yet passed,

659
01:14:43,421 --> 01:14:48,185
You will begin to remember moments of your past, Henry.

660
01:14:50,037 --> 01:14:54,128
And those memories are real.

661
01:14:55,453 --> 01:14:56,685
Are you who you are.

662
01:14:57,587 --> 01:14:58,623
Trust them.

663
01:15:35,944 --> 01:15:38,367
<i>Memories, memories, memories.</i>

664
01:15:42,408 --> 01:15:44,831
<i>My first batch of cyber-soldiers.</i>

665
01:15:47,131 --> 01:15:50,158
<i>All you have experienced today</i>

666
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:53,722
<i>Has been loaded into
what remains of their brains.</i>

667
01:15:54,123 --> 01:15:56,555
<i>All I remember is waking up in the laboratory...</i>

668
01:15:56,756 --> 01:15:59,988
<i>And his wife screw- legs.</i>

669
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:04,828
<i>I love you Charlie.</i>

670
01:16:08,287 --> 01:16:09,706
<i>I love you, Edward.</i>

671
01:16:13,511 --> 01:16:14,919
<i>I love you, Thomas.</i>

672
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:17,676
<i>Do you recognize?</i>

673
01:16:19,837 --> 01:16:20,881
<i>Right?</i>

674
01:16:21,615 --> 01:16:22,761
<i>How strange.</i>

675
01:16:24,744 --> 01:16:25,787
<i>Are your wife.</i>

676
01:16:29,109 --> 01:16:31,521
<i>I can smell what you like about it.</i>

677
01:16:33,543 --> 01:16:36,063
<i>They are almost ready for you.</i>

678
01:16:36,475 --> 01:16:40,284
<i>But I warn you, your
accelerators will seem to you have now...</i>

679
01:16:44,581 --> 01:16:45,998
A damn toy battery.

680
01:16:46,952 --> 01:16:48,407
Go ahead, jódelo.

681
01:21:49,817 --> 01:21:50,834
Get up.

682
01:21:51,034 --> 01:21:52,034
Get up!

683
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:55,532
ADRENALINE

684
01:23:10,712 --> 01:23:13,199
Can you handle this?

685
01:23:15,249 --> 01:23:16,404
Henry.

686
01:23:25,853 --> 01:23:27,584
Why do you hit yourself Henry?

687
01:23:45,109 --> 01:23:46,112
<i>Love?</i>

688
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:47,569
<i>Love, are you okay?</i>

689
01:23:48,071 --> 01:23:50,396
<i>I love how much you protect me.</i>

690
01:23:58,403 --> 01:23:59,460
You owe me an apology.

691
01:24:00,248 --> 01:24:01,284
Why?

692
01:24:03,181 --> 01:24:04,181
Dudar me.

693
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:07,309
Had certain apprehensions.

694
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:08,794
Why did you let me do it?

695
01:24:08,995 --> 01:24:13,206
Only I gave my wife liked
and losing all my men.

696
01:24:14,423 --> 01:24:16,208
Are they all dead?

697
01:24:18,671 --> 01:24:19,766
- Yes
- Yes.

698
01:24:19,966 --> 01:24:22,593
Do you know when to realize that this was working
?

699
01:24:22,793 --> 01:24:23,794
When?

700
01:24:24,131 --> 01:24:27,025
When Henry got me
to the escape pod,

701
01:24:28,425 --> 01:24:30,804
Trying to get me
lab and out.

702
01:24:31,405 --> 01:24:35,331
Who would have thought that the
vagina is a great motivator?

703
01:24:39,795 --> 01:24:43,530
hundred of you tomorrow, next week
thousand.

704
01:24:44,948 --> 01:24:47,824
The first memory of each one will be his wife
,

705
01:24:48,025 --> 01:24:52,128
Sliding a cheap ring finger bronze.

706
01:24:52,329 --> 01:24:54,139
Every one of my soldiers,

707
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:59,131
Wake
willing to do any thing my brilliant wife ask them,

708
01:25:00,031 --> 01:25:03,516
Either
march in Paris or in the garden of the White House.

709
01:25:04,269 --> 01:25:07,420
I would pretend to understand the role played
.

710
01:25:08,394 --> 01:25:10,545
You did not make history, Henry.

711
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:13,529
You helped end it.

712
01:25:28,935 --> 01:25:29,935
<i>You...</i>

713
01:25:30,852 --> 01:25:31,897
<i>Small...</i>

714
01:25:32,978 --> 01:25:34,014
Coward.

715
01:25:36,223 --> 01:25:37,747
It's like my mother told me.

716
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,598
It's like if my name.

717
01:25:41,813 --> 01:25:45,664
And I checked
killing all the wrong people.

718
01:25:49,732 --> 01:25:51,136
I love you, Henry.

719
01:25:52,201 --> 01:25:55,244
And never
call by another name than yours, but you must decide.

720
01:25:56,762 --> 01:26:00,019
Are you going to stand there lying
swallowing blood in your mouth?

721
01:26:01,785 --> 01:26:07,057
How you going to get up, spit it out,
and shed them?

722
01:26:23,071 --> 01:26:24,071
<i>Akan!</i>

723
01:26:24,258 --> 01:26:25,410
Damn...

724
01:27:14,022 --> 01:27:15,022
<i>No!</i>

725
01:27:15,321 --> 01:27:16,321
<i>Stop!</i>

726
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:19,059
I order you to stop!

727
01:27:23,581 --> 01:27:24,816
Henry!

728
01:27:25,218 --> 01:27:26,378
Stop!

729
01:28:00,774 --> 01:28:01,791
Where it is?

730
01:28:08,018 --> 01:28:09,019
No.

731
01:28:09,296 --> 01:28:11,354
Fuck you, motherfucker!

732

How could you
do this Henry?

734
01:28:15,678 --> 01:28:17,419
