1
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,885
What are you thinking about?

2
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,425
I feel like a failure.

3
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,064
That's because you are a failure.

4
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,960
Come on, failures usually
have a few more gray hairs.

5
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,698
You built me that dark room
and it just sits there.

6
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,372
I'm never gonna get my own show.

7
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,899
You will.

8
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,306
Hey, I'm hungry. Let's eat.

9
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,711
- Did you go to Wong's?
- No. Something better.

10
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,278
- Hot dogs?
- Yeah. You like hot dogs.

11
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,514
- No, I don't.
- Cajun veggie, your favorite.

12
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,760
- Can I have some ketchup?
- Yes.

13
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,359
- There you go.
- Thank you.

14
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,337
Oh, my God.

15
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:31,839
Where did you get this?

16
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,971
I crossed the desert,
and I fought the freeways,

17
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,080
and I braved a visit with my father.

18
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,551
It was my mother's.

19
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,356
This is the only thing of hers
that he managed to hold on to.

20
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,754
So, will you?

21
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,499
Yes. Yes.

22
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:58,968
Oh, my God.

23
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,640
Yes.

24
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,040
- You smell good.
- How do I smell?

25
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,542
Like a hot dog.

26
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,117
That is so beautiful.

27
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,425
- I was so scared.
- You were?

28
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,097
I love it.

29
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,607
- And I was afraid you weren't gonna ask.
- Were you?

30
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,475
I've been thinking about it for a while.

31
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,381
I don't know. The world's so fucked up.

32
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,881
I thought it would be good for us
to stake out our little corner somewhere

33
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,786
away from all the insanity.

34
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,259
- Izzy?
- Mmm-hmm?

35
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,402
Why don't we blow a wad
on the honeymoon?

36
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,631
You know, like... What about Italy?

37
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,737
Mmm. Lago di Como.

38
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,576
It always looked like
the most beautiful place in the world.

39
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:22,808
Yeah, so we could fly into Rome,
and we could make our way north.

40
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,639
- Mmm-hmm.
- You know?

41
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:37,827
I have to be honest.

42
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,456
- What?
- Your alarm went off.

43
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:46,201
Whoa, it's after 6:00.
Greg gave us a 7:00 call.

44
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,339
Oh, man.

45
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,744
Honey, come back. I'll be really quick.

46
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,026
- Wanna close down one stop?
- Okay.

47
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,560
- It's a 4-5-6 split.
- Right.

48
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,899
All right.

49
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,232
- I think he wants to watch that one.
- Yeah.

50
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,312
There it is. Beautiful.
There she goes. Lovely.

51
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,374
Izzy, my dear,
could you give me the 150, please?

52
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,449
Yeah.

53
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,769
Hey, Delaney.

54
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,706
Now, what Shaw believed

55
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,844
was that stasis is impossible.

56
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,812
Our choice as humans
is to determine our own course

57
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,349
or to have it determined for us.

58
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,255
Blindness and ignorance

59
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,889
inevitably lead to destruction.

60
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,964
In either event,
the life force propels us relentlessly.

61
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,892
And what is the French term for "life force"?

62
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,032
Une vie de force?

63
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,270
- No one? Come on.
- Elan vital?

64
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:07,935
Elan vital, vital impetus, life force.

65
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,374
And that is going to be on the midterm.

66
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,214
So, you had better read your Bergson.

67
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,514
First new message.

68
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,718
Hey, it's me, your fiancée.

69
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,328
Thanks for taking away my excuses.

70
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,998
It's clean. Maybe too clean.

71
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,037
Maybe, when you get home,
we could mess it up a little.

72
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,248
- Hello?
- I'm looking for my fiancée.

73
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,616
When are you coming home?

74
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:26,089
Probably late, honey, grunt work.
I have a meeting with Carlton.

75
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,783
He's asked me to sit in on a rehearsal. So...

76
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,623
Go ahead. Don't worry. If you're late,
I'll just catch a movie with Miranda.

77
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,927
Okay, I'll try you later for an ETA.

78
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,729
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

79
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:38,565
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

80
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,294
Come on.

81
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,930
It's all right.

82
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,772
It's okay.

83
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,137
Don't be scared.

84
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,890
- Thanks for inviting me in.
- What?

85
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:50,332
- Shut up.
- But...

86
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,097
- Shut the fuck up!
- Please!

87
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,264
- Did I tell you to shut up, huh?
- Please.

88
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,337
Didn't I tell you to shut the fuck up?

89
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,402
Please don't do this.
Please don't do this. Please.

90
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:03,606
- Is anyone else around?
- No.

91
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:07,152
Good. 'Cause I don't like surprises.

92
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:14,025
Say, listen. I just heard Lopez
took a position with Vassar.

93
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,558
Leaves an opening for you.

94
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,927
- I just appreciate you trying, you know.
- It's my pleasure. Take care.

95
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,124
Thanks.

96
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,634
Honey?

97
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:51,923
Izzy?

98
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,849
Izzy?

99
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,535
I'm sorry. You okay? You okay?

100
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,087
It's okay. It's okay.

101
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,818
Give me your hand.

102
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,797
Dr. Rotblatt, dial 1777. Dr. Rotblatt.

103
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,447
I just want to make sure about
your decision to refuse the forensic.

104
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:56,487
If you let us collect the specimens now,
we can preserve the evidence

105
00:15:56,588 --> 00:16:01,582
and it will be there for you, if you change
your mind about making a police report.

106
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:06,591
Once you bathe,
that choice will be lost to you.

107
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,059
Do you understand?

108
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:14,806
I understand.

109
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,550
- Hey!
- Peter Delaney?

110
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,554
- Yes.
- Isabel is okay.

111
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:34,955
We've run all the necessary tests,
and we've given her antibiotics. No injuries.

112
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,552
In the meantime,
here are some pills to help her sleep,

113
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,193
and a prescription for later.

114
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,165
Why did the cops leave?

115
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,868
Isabel has refused to speak with them.

116
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,940
- Why?
- Well, this is very common.

117
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,711
Shock expresses itself in different ways.
I'm sorry.

118
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,002
Okay.

119
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,978
- Can I go and see her?
- Yeah.

120
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,412
Thank you.

121
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,011
Izzy?

122
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,224
Hey, let me help you.

123
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,000
Is it true

124
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,769
that you don't wanna report it?

125
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,739
I just want to forget about it.

126
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,174
All of it.

127
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:32,508
Okay. Now, Izz...

128
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,082
- Listen.
- Please. Let me.

129
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,330
We really need to talk to the police.

130
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,330
It's pointless.

131
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,746
Was it somebody that we know?

132
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,556
Did you at least get a good look at the guy?
I mean...

133
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,725
- I can't do this right now, okay?
- Yeah, but...

134
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,662
Okay.

135
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:24,071
- Hi. Len with Security Guard.
- Hey. Come in.

136
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,744
- Thanks for fitting me in.
- No problem.

137
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,079
Wow, looks like you've got a bunch
of windows here.

138
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,383
It may be more than the $1,500
they quoted you.

139
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,654
- Where do you wanna start?
- Over there'll be fine.

140
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:16,483
I got you. I really got you.

141
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:22,365
You're fucked. And I fucked you up.
I take full credit.

142
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,560
Izzy?

143
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,193
You all right?

144
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:27,772
Uh-huh.

145
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,508
You hungry?

146
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,482
I have another headache.

147
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,741
I'll get you some aspirin.

148
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:45,081
- Greg called.
- You didn't tell him, did you?

149
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,115
No.

150
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,267
I can't.

151
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,837
I can't.

152
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,406
How do you feel about moving?

153
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,250
We could sell the house.

154
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,611
Honey, I really appreciate it, but you can't.

155
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,616
It was your mom's.

156
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:04,487
You see, if I get moved up this year,
we could find a better neighborhood.

157
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,162
I know what you're trying to do.

158
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,359
It won't fix it.

159
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,250
Sweetheart, this is awful, horrific.

160
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:30,746
- I told you this neighborhood was no good.
- Mom, please.

161
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:34,256
Peter said you weren't eating,
so I scoured Craig Claiborne

162
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,327
for something to whet your appetite.

163
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,864
He's got this great hush puppy recipe.
They're made with white cornmeal.

164
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,225
I cut the butter, nixed the sugar,

165
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:47,067
and replaced it with that wild honey
from Provence you love so much.

166
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,099
And have some braised quail.

167
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,000
Mom, I'm a vegetarian.

168
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,704
I know, but, it's such a stupid habit.

169
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,605
Here, let me brush your hair.

170
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,581
No, don't. Come one. It's okay. It's okay.

171
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,655
I can't stand to see you like this.

172
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,890
Living, just plain living is such a torment.

173
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,826
Maybe we were lucky Teddy died so young.

174
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,990
I thought losing an infant
was as bad as it gets.

175
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,592
But maybe I should be grateful
that you weren't killed.

176
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:23,902
But I never ever thought that
anything like this would ever happen to me.

177
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,702
Mom, it's gonna be okay.

178
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:29,371
This is not okay. It'll never be okay.

179
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,914
- How am I going to tell your dad?
- Don't! I asked you not to.

180
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:36,351
Why do mothers always have to bear
the brunt of the messes in life?

181
00:27:36,454 --> 00:27:38,388
- Mom, promise me.
- Promise what?

182
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,981
- Not to tell Dad.
- You are making a lot out of this.

183
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,652
I'm holding you to it, okay?
You have to promise me.

184
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:46,993
- Fine, I promise.
- Now, can you leave?

185
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,356
Sure.

186
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,032
- I'll be in the living room, if you need me.
- No.

187
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,503
Go home. I need to be alone.

188
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,900
Am I being fired?

189
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:13,987
Hang on, I have to get this
or the alarm will blast.

190
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,629
- Hi.
- Hi.

191
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,254
- Come in.
- Yeah.

192
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,357
Hey.

193
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,495
Sorry.

194
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,035
- Hello?
- Can you believe those Lakers?

195
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,343
I didn't go to the game.

196
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:38,047
You missed the season opener?
Is this what happens when I'm not there?

197
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,451
I'm just pooped from a night shoot.

198
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:46,319
Well, I finish this assignment next week,
and I'll call when I'm back in town.

199
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,722
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

200
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,857
Did you just lie to your dad?

201
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,794
You never lie to him.

202
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,926
Mandy, don't tell anybody.

203
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:00,831
Nobody.

204
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:03,763
Of course not.

205
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,101
Are you in training?

206
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:05,736
No.

207
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:10,869
Then why the hell are you running so fast?
I can't keep up with you.

208
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,070
Okay, come on, darling. Let's go.

209
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,441
Honey, I know I wasn't much help to you
the other day.

210
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,745
And I'm sorry.

211
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,783
But you and I both know that
you can't mope around forever.

212
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,114
Depression's bad for everyone.

213
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,481
I made some calls.

214
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:02,988
And this is kind of like the Radcliffe group
therapy for near-death experiences.

215
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,892
I made you a batch
of Cousin Bette's ginger cookies.

216
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:10,058
Those girls in there probably
need resuscitation as much as you do.

217
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,136
Here's a thermos of chamomile tea,
but don't share.

218
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:14,205
Too many viruses going around.

219
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:16,671
Okay, honey, let's go in. Come on.

220
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,736
I'll pick you up in an hour.

221
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:22,335
I can wait in the car. I'm knitting
another one of your favorite style.

222
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,779
Go on, sweetie. Go on.

223
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,699
Hi. My name is Marcia.

224
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,360
But everybody calls me Marcie.

225
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,597
Welcome to Safe Haven.

226
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:53,938
Telling the story of how we've been violated

227
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,713
can be very therapeutic.

228
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,477
And that is why we do it

229
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,412
over and over

230
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,179
and over again.

231
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,258
Stacey, would you like to start?

232
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,256
My parents were away for the weekend,

233
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,890
and my brother's best friend
was hanging out with us.

234
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,693
I was waiting for a bus on Wilshire,

235
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,269
and it was getting dark.

236
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,310
Twenty years ago
something happened to me.

237
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,446
Now, every year at this time, I get suicidal.

238
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,245
He had a knife, and he put it down there.

239
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,353
And he said,
"Either you let me jam this up your hole,

240
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,356
"or I'll jam this up your hole."

241
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:01,108
New message
sent today at 1... 12 p.m.

242
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,708
I thought you'd wanna know
that a nurse just called.

243
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:09,210
They gave me a clean bill of health.
No life-threatening diseases.

244
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,246
Okay. Bye.

245
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,040
You awake?

246
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:40,112
Hey, I got your message.

247
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,149
That was great news.

248
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,025
You okay?

249
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,249
Thanks, man.

250
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,318
- Where's Izzy?
- She's sleeping.

251
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,027
She's been feeling
a little under the weather lately.

252
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,865
Do you believe in fate?

253
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,700
I try not to trouble myself
with such deep thoughts.

254
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,639
Look, I know you've been pissed.

255
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:44,046
You know, tenure's just
not all it's cracked up to be.

256
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:49,151
I mean, it's not the answer to life's woes,
if that's what you're hoping.

257
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,312
Do you remember that story,

258
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,422
Appointment in Samarra?

259
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,891
Remind me.

260
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:00,990
It's about this guy who sees Death,

261
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,760
and he thinks it's come for him.

262
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:07,827
So, he flees to another city, only to
discover that Death is waiting for him there.

263
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,242
It's, you know, that

264
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,947
fate will find you, no matter where you run.

265
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,217
You're so fucking Irish.

266
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,287
What was that saying of your father's?

267
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:28,386
"We're all dancing.

268
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,819
- "You're dancing on your grave."
- "Dancing on our graves."

269
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,564
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

270
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,364
- What'd you do today?
- Nothing.

271
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,736
Is something wrong?

272
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:59,239
I've been wondering if we'll ever get back
to what we were.

273
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:05,580
What were we?

274
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,284
Engaged.

275
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,188
Not just to each other but in life.

276
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:14,622
I don't know.

277
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,463
I'd really like to.

278
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:24,604
I think you ought to go back to work.

279
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,942
Everything just feels so different.

280
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,869
Why should I?

281
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,179
I think it might help.

282
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,210
It's meaningless.

283
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,387
You don't know that.

284
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,190
Give me a reason.

285
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,428
For starters,
who needs another photographer?

286
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:53,797
Why should I take pictures?

287
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:57,305
It's not gonna change the fact
that the world is a miserable place.

288
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,339
Suffering, starvation, people killing,
maiming each other.

289
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,278
We're all just gonna end up dead.
So what's the point?

290
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,674
So I could take light meter readings

291
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,082
and give teenage girls
a bad body image? What?

292
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:19,894
There's someone I found at school
that I'd like you to see.

293
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,172
At least do that for me.

294
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,519
Try and tell me, from the beginning.

295
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,920
- That's hard.
- I know, but try.

296
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,663
Every detail you can remember.

297
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,437
I was in my studio,

298
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,732
sorting prints.

299
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,136
I've been working on my own stuff
for a couple of years,

300
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,874
whenever I can get enough money together
from my regular job.

301
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,388
A bird flew in the window.

302
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,721
I didn't close the window.

303
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:32,357
Well, there's nothing criminal
about leaving a window open, is there?

304
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,631
But he...

305
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:40,667
- Yes?
- He said, "Thanks for inviting me in."

306
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,910
Let me see you play cards with this boy.

307
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,417
With this boy?

308
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:52,122
But he is a common laboring boy!

309
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,582
That's how I feel.

310
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:54,851
Look at his boots!

311
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,426
Like what?

312
00:39:56,827 --> 00:40:00,228
Like Estella. I'm a cold bitch.

313
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:02,864
You're not a cold bitch.

314
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,461
Really?

315
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,966
You're more like a blob.

316
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,271
That doorbell needs some work.

317
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,748
- Hi.
- Hi, Mandy. It's nice to see you.

318
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,216
- You, too.
- Hi, Izz.

319
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,015
- Hey, Dad.
- I had a late meeting with my editor.

320
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:27,522
So I thought I'd swing by on my way home.

321
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,750
Mom and I went to the basketball game
the other night.

322
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:32,152
We missed you.

323
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,990
I got you a program
and a new Lakers T-shirt.

324
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:36,433
Thanks.

325
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,231
- How you doing?
- I've been a little under the weather.

326
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,203
What are your symptoms?

327
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:48,407
Headaches. I'm getting better though.

328
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:50,781
Okay, sweets.

329
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,317
This has really been dragging on though.

330
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,676
Maybe you should see a specialist.

331
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:59,319
Just say the word,
you know I'll get the best doctor.

332
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,358
I know you will.

333
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,820
- Where's Peter?
- He's working late.

334
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,330
Do you wanna come in?

335
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,927
No. No, I better go. Mom's cooking.

336
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:17,336
She's creating some kind of Punjabi feast.

337
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,439
- How about lunch, next week?
- Okay.

338
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:22,546
Bye.

339
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,550
Hey, Peter!

340
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:09,020
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

341
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,159
- Hey, how's Izzy?
- She's fine.

342
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:15,255
I can't get her on the phone.
I hope it's nothing serious.

343
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:16,733
No. No.

344
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:19,965
Will you please tell her she bloody well
better call me soon, will you?

345
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:21,204
I miss her.

346
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,763
- I will.
- Great.

347
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,199
- All right, I gotta go.
- All right then.

348
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,436
- Take care.
- See you.

349
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,069
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

350
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,079
I can't think anymore.
I have another one of those headaches.

351
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,285
You said something about surprises.

352
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:44,188
He said he was glad
that nobody else was around.

353
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,993
I think you know what I want,
and if you don't give it to me,

354
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,667
I'm gonna poke this thing
through your fucking head.

355
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:52,392
You understand?

356
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:55,631
A pick in the head.

357
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,708
That would give me headaches, too.

358
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,336
- You cooked.
- Yep. Pasta.

359
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:41,875
It smells good.

360
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:57,958
How was your day?

361
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,170
It could have been better.

362
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,429
What happened?

363
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:08,510
They chose David to head
the Admissions Committee.

364
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:12,916
I'm sorry.

365
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,215
When did you find out?

366
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,513
A few days ago.

367
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,725
You can't beat us on the outside.

368
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,556
You've got no outside.

369
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,861
- Put it up.
- That's in there.

370
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:34,431
That's a foul, baby.

371
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,604
Getting engaged has made you soft, huh?

372
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,972
I missed a basket, Larry.
It's not a metaphor.

373
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,070
Switch up! Switch up!

374
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:44,605
I got him! I got him!

375
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:58,824
- Are you all right? Come on.
- Fuck you!

376
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:02,194
- Hey, fuck you, man! It's just ball.
- What's with the fucking elbow?

377
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:05,325
- Come on. Give me a break!
- Peter, it's only a ball, man.

378
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:08,833
Come on. Shake it off. Come on.

379
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,815
- Hello.
- It's me.

380
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,091
Hey, Dad.

381
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:29,559
Everything okay?

382
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,196
- You busy?
- Kind of. What do you... What do you want?

383
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,694
I'd like you to come up this weekend.

384
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:10,295
My father called today.

385
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:12,168
Is he all right?

386
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,170
I don't know.

387
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,704
He asked me to come up and see him.

388
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,076
For how long?

389
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,579
A couple of days.

390
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,648
I'm afraid to be left alone.

391
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,652
- Go with him.
- He doesn't want me to.

392
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,320
Why didn't you just ask?

393
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:42,463
Because...

394
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:45,960
I'm so amenable.

395
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:48,171
Amenable?

396
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,666
Yeah. A people pleaser, you know.

397
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,640
I'll do anything to make things easy.

398
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:56,772
How does being amenable fit in here?

399
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:59,607
I don't know.

400
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:07,052
I guess I think that
maybe I should have fought back.

401
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,486
I did everything he told me to do.

402
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,262
Words were my weapon.

403
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,633
I remember thinking, "I've gotta stop this."

404
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,132
Suck me again.

405
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:21,404
I can't.

406
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,607
Suck it.

407
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,939
- I can't.
- Why?

408
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,707
Because I don't love you.

409
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,218
Fuck you!

410
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,123
What made you make that choice?

411
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:50,789
He could have killed you.

412
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,698
He was grungy.

413
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:57,429
But there was this...

414
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,439
faint smell of cheap soap,

415
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,513
like he'd washed for me.

416
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:07,274
So I had hope.

417
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,823
I looked into his eyes
and there was something

418
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,656
buried deep inside of him. There was...

419
00:48:17,694 --> 00:48:19,685
It was something human.

420
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,890
He must have felt that, I guess.

421
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:26,459
How clearheaded.

422
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,798
And then he said,
"Now what am I gonna do with you?"

423
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,636
And I was terrified.

424
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,640
I thought he was gonna kill me anyway.

425
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:04,938
- I could come with you.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

426
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,407
You're kind of relieved to get away,
aren't you?

427
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:10,780
That's ridiculous.

428
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:15,107
My father called. He asked me to come up.
He's never done that before. Never.

429
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,143
You know, I don't even know what he wants.

430
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,318
He says he needs me, so I've gotta go.

431
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,118
But you're happy about it.
Why can't you just admit it?

432
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:28,929
Why are you being like this?

433
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,794
Being like what? How am I being?

434
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,962
It's like you're not here,
like you're dying to get away from me. Why?

435
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,997
Come on! Tell me! I wanna know why.

436
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,131
All right, yes.

437
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,276
Yes.

438
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:42,972
You wanna know why?
Because I feel like shit.

439
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:46,276
I feel like shit that you're
not happy anymore.

440
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,542
I feel like shit
that I can't always be there for you.

441
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,381
And I feel like shit that
I didn't kill the guy,

442
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,182
that I can't do anything to change that.

443
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,849
He's probably out there
doing it to somebody else.

444
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:58,517
And I really feel like shit
that you didn't talk to the police.

445
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,363
I mean, why didn't you? Huh?
That was all that we had.

446
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,601
I couldn't.

447
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:13,565
Yeah.

448
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,304
Do you think it was my fault?

449
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:20,242
God, no, Izzy!

450
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,648
I'm sorry. See, I'm so frustrated.

451
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:31,017
I've wanted to help.

452
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,496
And I've tried,

453
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,898
but I'm beginning to think that I just...
That I just don't know how anymore.

454
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:56,419
Come with me.

455
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,784
Come with me.

456
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,059
If you still want to.

457
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:05,595
I don't.

458
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,457
- Hello.
- Hi, Izzy. It's Larry.

459
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:42,828
- Is Peter there?
- No. No, he went to go see his father.

460
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,130
We were supposed to run this morning
and yesterday morning.

461
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,136
- Did he mention the Lakers game?
- No.

462
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:52,474
I've got two pairs of tickets for Wednesday
night. I want you guys to meet Kim.

463
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,200
I'll remind him.

464
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:55,812
Izzy?

465
00:51:58,014 --> 00:51:59,845
Peter hasn't been himself lately.

466
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,012
Is something wrong?

467
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:05,548
Yeah. Yeah, I guess there is.

468
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,624
- What?
- I got raped.

469
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,198
I didn't know.

470
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,161
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

471
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,002
It's okay. No one knew.

472
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:26,876
I...

473
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,411
Well, I hope
you guys can make it Wednesday.

474
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,543
You can come out and have a few beers.

475
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:35,418
I don't know.

476
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,081
- Izzy?
- Yeah?

477
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:43,983
Did they catch the guy?

478
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:45,695
No. No, they didn't.

479
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,543
Dad?

480
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,175
Shit!

481
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,114
How'd that ring go over?

482
00:54:23,226 --> 00:54:24,454
You never told me.

483
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:32,065
Took me 39 paychecks
to buy your mother that ring.

484
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,630
- Did I ever tell you that?
- No, you didn't.

485
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:40,276
So?

486
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,112
She loved it.

487
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,847
Good.

488
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:50,812
Where in the world
did you manage to find catfish?

489
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:55,051
Crenshaw District. They have everything.

490
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:58,885
Why don't we eat out on the porch?

491
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:02,623
Play you my new album.
It's in mint condition.

492
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:20,540
- He blames me.
- For what?

493
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:25,419
Not going to the police.
Not saving myself, I guess.

494
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,382
Why didn't you talk to the police?

495
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,423
- Are you trying to make me feel bad?
- No.

496
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,658
Huh? 'Cause you're the one
who left the window open, aren't you?

497
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:37,824
Aren't you?

498
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,196
It was so fucking easy!

499
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:42,066
I was just trying
to answer your question, that's all.

500
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:43,773
Look.

501
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:49,003
- You better not go to the police.
- I won't.

502
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,176
- Do you promise me?
- I promise.

503
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:54,648
Because if you do, I'll come back here...

504
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:56,812
And the next time...

505
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,978
The next time, I'll kill you.

506
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,515
You understand?

507
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,132
You certainly kept your promise.

508
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:12,133
He gave me my life.

509
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,969
I felt grateful for that.

510
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,999
By striking that deal,

511
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,375
you entered into some kind of,

512
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:25,714
for want of a better word,

513
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,617
relationship with him.

514
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,689
All right, so tell me,
how'd you get the shiner?

515
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,027
- It's nothing.
- It's nothing?

516
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:49,601
Some clerks at the Shop 'n Save
were trying to organize.

517
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,240
I got the manager a little ticked off.

518
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,971
It's better than spending my time
grading roads for the BLM.

519
00:56:59,215 --> 00:57:01,012
I thought you gave that shit up.

520
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:09,019
- I wish just once you'd surprise me.
- Surprise you? How?

521
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,286
Well, for starters, by being an adult.

522
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,418
You know what would really be nice?

523
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:17,059
It would be nice if you could accept me.

524
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:19,798
Me, just the way I am.

525
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,871
An old lefty who likes to believe
that what he does has meaning,

526
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:25,201
even if it doesn't.

527
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:30,238
Who's a father who's fucked up,
but who's your father.

528
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,547
How's that for a surprise?

529
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:38,450
I'm sick and tired of sitting around
watching you make a mess of your life.

530
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:41,581
- I never asked you to watch.
- All right, so why am I here then?

531
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:43,722
I want to go home.

532
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:48,292
- To Arkansas.
- There's nothing there for you.

533
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:49,989
It's home.

534
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,794
But you always said that you loved it here.

535
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,635
I changed my mind.

536
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:55,328
So you've changed your mind again.

537
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:59,238
Who are you,
in your self-righteous condescension?

538
00:57:59,342 --> 00:58:01,936
All right, so, supposing you go back,
where are you gonna stay?

539
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:04,944
With an old buddy of mine
from my organizing days.

540
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:08,341
He's got a little place near Heber Springs.

541
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,723
So you really want to go?

542
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:20,286
I wouldn't be foolish enough
to put us both through this if I didn't.

543
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:03,304
Izzy! Izzy, where are you?

544
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:04,998
What are you doing here?

545
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:07,941
I'm knitting you a sweater. I just wanted
to measure the length of the sleeve.

546
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,137
Shit. How did you get in?

547
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,271
Well, your car was there,
but your bell doesn't work.

548
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,249
So I came in through the window.
What were you doing? I was worried.

549
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:16,318
Sleeping.

550
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:18,785
Why are you still in bed
at 2:00 in the afternoon?

551
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:22,184
You're never gonna recover
if you just keep moping around.

552
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:25,757
Activity is the greatest cure-all.
Believe me, I know.

553
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:31,765
After Teddy died,
remember how I couldn't get out of bed?

554
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:33,435
But I fought it!

555
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,795
And that's what you have to do now.

556
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,837
These sheets are a little grungy.
Get up and I'll pop them in the wash.

557
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:42,105
I don't want my sheets washed!
I'm an adult for Christ's sakes.

558
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,736
- Darling, why are you so on edge?
- "On edge"?

559
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,149
Maybe because you broke into my house
and set off my alarm?

560
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:51,347
Or maybe because you seem to take
special pleasure in nagging me,

561
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:54,582
telling me to sleep less, eat more,
do this, do that?

562
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:56,090
You know what's wrong with you?

563
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:59,753
No, but go ahead and tell me. I'm sure
you will, whether I ask you to or not.

564
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:02,854
You're still holding on to your pain.

565
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,457
You're refusing to let go.

566
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:08,100
It's like you're taking
some kind of perverse pleasure

567
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:10,104
in rolling around in your own misery.

568
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:13,073
You have got to move on. Just let go.

569
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,207
- Let go?
- Yes. Let go.

570
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,673
Has there been one day, one single day

571
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,147
since Teddy died,
that you haven't mourned him?

572
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:24,118
Did it ever even occur to you
that maybe I was sad, too,

573
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,983
but I had to refrain from showing it

574
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:29,058
because your despair
was just a bottomless pit?

575
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,322
I'm not strong.

576
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:40,058
You've always been stronger.

577
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,299
I've always admired you for it.

578
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:50,038
I know you don't need me over here
with my knitting,

579
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,738
telling you how to run your life.

580
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:53,979
But don't you see?

581
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:56,876
You're the only thing I have left.

582
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:03,381
And so I guess that is selfish of me.

583
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,092
- Hello.
- Pip, no! No!

584
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:52,068
- I don't think he knows his name yet.
- What is this?

585
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:55,241
My mom broke in.
I went to the pound and got a dog.

586
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:56,333
I see.

587
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,277
Larry called. There's a Lakers game tonight.

588
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,508
Are you gonna come?

589
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:02,811
Maybe dinner. I'm not sure about the game.

590
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,345
How's your father?

591
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:07,813
He's the same.

592
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,194
Shit!

593
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:14,360
I must have missed one.

594
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,424
Sorry.

595
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:31,812
Okay, we'll have three rum samplers
and a mojito.

596
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:33,345
- Coming right up.
- Thanks.

597
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,243
- So, you like basketball?
- No.

598
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:41,555
What do you like?

599
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,215
What do you mean what do I like?
What kind of sports?

600
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,658
- Yeah.
- Sports to play or sports to watch?

601
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,128
- Sports to watch.
- Football, baby.

602
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,956
I'm from Oklahoma.
I like guys who can kick ass.

603
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,365
- That's how we met.
- Kicking ass?

604
01:02:55,571 --> 01:02:56,595
Him?

605
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:01,542
- Izzy's into football.
- Yeah, and boxing, and basketball...

606
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:04,442
- My father's a sports writer.
- He's a great sports writer.

607
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,940
- What's his name?
- John Fieldston.

608
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:11,720
Fieldston wrote that great piece
on the pros and cons of instant replay.

609
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,279
That was him.

610
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,592
When are they gonna get it right, huh?

611
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,619
- Do you go to the games?
- Yeah, I used to.

612
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:24,257
- Used to?
- Parking is a bitch, so...

613
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:28,164
It's not the parking. It's the crowds.
They scare me.

614
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:30,100
People can be crazy.

615
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:32,975
I got raped.

616
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:40,707
That must have been awful.

617
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:42,881
Yeah. It was.

618
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,711
Since you told me,
I can't stop thinking about it.

619
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,821
I can't even imagine what that was like.

620
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:51,887
You told Larry. Okay, when did...

621
01:03:52,428 --> 01:03:53,725
When did you tell Larry?

622
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,128
I've been working on an analogy,
for men that is,

623
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:59,668
and it's hot off the presses, so it might be
a little raw. You wanna hear it?

624
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:01,396
- Sure.
- Of course.

625
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,371
For a guy, it would be like somebody
taking a shit in front of you,

626
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:05,462
putting a gun to your head

627
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,271
and telling you to eat the shit
or he's gonna blow your brains out.

628
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:11,244
- Izzy...
- Then, while you're licking the shit,

629
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,544
you're wondering if when you're done,
he's still gonna blow your brains out.

630
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,515
Izz, why are you doing this?

631
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,416
I don't know. It feels good to say it.

632
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,989
Well, I'm glad it feels good,
but it's not very appropriate.

633
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:24,526
Appropriate? Is that really
what you're concerned about? Appropriate?

634
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:28,523
- Hey, come on, you guys. You're both upset.
- Larry, shut up. No, it's okay.

635
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,599
See, I've been harboring this secret
for a very long time,

636
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,158
and I'd really like to know why,
after all this time, you decide

637
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:36,161
to blurt it out for no reason.

638
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:40,174
Why? I'll tell you why. Because it's better
to tell the truth than it is to lie.

639
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:44,439
This is not some unforgivable blemish
that I have to hold on to forever.

640
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,845
- You're just doing it to get at me.
- No, I'm not.

641
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:50,112
Well, why? You doing it to shock people?
Is that what you're trying to do?

642
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,652
I'm sorry. Did I shock you?

643
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:55,521
Because their shock is nothing compared
to what mine was. I can promise you that!

644
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:59,652
All right, well, if it feels this satisfying
to you, don't let me stop you.

645
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,525
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

646
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:06,033
Go ahead! Go on, hit me! All right?

647
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:08,626
I've had a lot of practice
in that department. Hit me.

648
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:10,996
Just do it. Come on, do it!

649
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:15,138
Come on, Peter. You guys, you're both upset.
Peter, don't do this.

650
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,407
- Come on, let's have a nice night.
- Kim, very nice to meet you.

651
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,977
- Oh, my god.
- Shit!

652
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:38,024
Izzy, Izzy, stop, you can't go. You can't go.

653
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,196
- You never really loved me.
- No, listen, you can't say that,

654
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:44,740
because I love you. You know I love you.
I've always loved you, and I love you now.

655
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:46,603
Then why did you stop touching me?

656
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:49,109
Hey, it's you that hasn't wanted to touch me.

657
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:53,107
- Listen...
- The thing is, is that I feel like

658
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,706
I might be ready,
and it seems like you don't want to.

659
01:05:57,687 --> 01:05:59,985
- All that love is wasted.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

660
01:06:00,089 --> 01:06:01,989
Izzy, Izzy, please listen.

661
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,854
Something has happened to me, too.

662
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:08,191
Okay?
And I just don't have the scars to prove it.

663
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,260
You're hurting my arm. Let go.

664
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,828
Peter, let go.

665
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:35,320
Are you speaking with him?

666
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:38,351
No.

667
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:43,893
I know it must be really hard for you.
You've been together for so long.

668
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:49,935
- Dad?
- Yeah?

669
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,607
What made you and Mom
last all these years?

670
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,975
Well, I think it's because I'm never bored.

671
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:02,778
And because our neuroses
overlap so perfectly.

672
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:05,247
- I know how crazy she can be.
- Hmm.

673
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:07,585
With the paper folding,

674
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:11,082
me going freelance this late in my career,

675
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:13,317
losing Teddy.

676
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:17,091
I suppose she never really recovered.

677
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:23,838
Do you know what they say
about great fighters?

678
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:28,268
Ali, Marciano, Sugar Ray?

679
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,745
When they get the shit kicked out of them,

680
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,777
they always come back.

681
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:37,719
Izz.

682
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:41,021
You've come so far.

683
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:43,656
You've been so brave.

684
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,528
She told you.

685
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,665
It's not her fault. I got it out of her.

686
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:53,067
I knew something was wrong.

687
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:55,293
You didn't want me to know?

688
01:07:58,541 --> 01:07:59,735
Why?

689
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:05,504
You were the... You were the one person I...

690
01:08:07,783 --> 01:08:08,750
I couldn't.

691
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:19,083
I know how you always want to fix things
for me, and...

692
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:24,591
This is... This is unfixable.

693
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,427
And I...

694
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,271
I still wanted to be your little girl.

695
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,715
Sitting next to you at the games.

696
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:07,964
Hey, you broke your promise. You told.

697
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,498
And you promised never to tell anyone.

698
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:12,665
I promise.

699
01:10:12,775 --> 01:10:13,867
Remember?

700
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:17,912
A promise to a rapist who says he'll kill you
is not a promise.

701
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,076
It's begging for your life.

702
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,854
- I want to ask you something.
- Shoot.

703
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,555
Why'd you rape me?

704
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:31,754
Because I could.

705
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,977
Get out! Get out of my head!

706
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,277
You're poison! I want you out!

707
01:10:55,384 --> 01:10:57,545
Get out of me, you fucking idiot!

708
01:10:57,653 --> 01:11:00,121
You motherfucker! Get out! Get out!

709
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:40,161
You keep it.

710
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:46,759
- She leave or you leave?
- Dad, do you mind?

711
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:49,166
You can't answer a simple question?

712
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,407
She did.

713
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,776
Same with your mother.

714
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:59,945
Yeah, she left you,
and she died of a broken heart,

715
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,483
'cause all you ever cared about
were your fucking causes.

716
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:04,779
I'm not going to get into that.

717
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:06,818
I might say things I would regret.

718
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:09,581
Besides, you're off point.

719
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:12,456
- Dad, stop, please. Really.
- Peter,

720
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,187
what happened?

721
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,366
Dad, she...

722
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,280
I don't really feel like discussing it, so...

723
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:35,817
I came to help you pack, so let's pack you.

724
01:12:36,852 --> 01:12:38,877
Is that why you came out here?

725
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:55,202
How's she running?

726
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:58,467
Pretty good. She's still alive.

727
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,769
- She's a beauty.
- Yeah.

728
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,179
All right. See you.

729
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:25,922
- Hello?
- Izzy? You're never gonna believe it.

730
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:28,019
- What?
- I've met somebody.

731
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,529
Is it a he or a she?

732
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:33,996
It's a he. He's a soundman.

733
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:35,797
- Is that a joke?
- No, really.

734
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:38,702
We met at Dailies. His name's Caleb.

735
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:42,538
He's having a little thing Saturday night.
I want you to check him out.

736
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,271
Can you come?

737
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:49,279
Hello? Izzy?

738
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:51,613
Are you there?

739
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:53,779
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

740
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:58,292
- Izzy?
- Can I call you back?

741
01:14:58,393 --> 01:14:59,985
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

742
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:29,554
Hi, Mom.

743
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:33,293
Oh, honey.

744
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:39,291
Thought I'd just stop by your new place
and see how you're doing.

745
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:48,038
I smell Cousin Bette's ginger cookies.

746
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:49,337
What's the occasion?

747
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:51,674
Miranda has a new boyfriend.
They're having a party.

748
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,805
- Can I have one of these?
- Mmm-hmm.

749
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:56,646
I hope you rendered the butter
so they're chewy inside.

750
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:04,187
This isn't my recipe.

751
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:06,554
You changed Cousin Bette's recipe.

752
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,994
She got that from our great aunt Cordelia,

753
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:12,624
who got it handed down to her
from our great-great grandmother Evelyn.

754
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:16,329
Mom, forget about the lineage.
How does it taste?

755
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:24,402
Fresh ginger.

756
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:27,946
- You used fresh instead of dried ginger.
- Mmm-hmm.

757
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:31,617
- How much?
- Four tablespoons.

758
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:35,080
That's a lot.

759
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:41,589
I like it here.

760
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:09,114
They are gonna stay in the race.

761
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:13,354
With the game tied two to two,
we'll be right back after this.

762
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:18,663
- Have you talked to him?
- Dad, don't start.

763
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:20,928
Start what?

764
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:22,560
Being wise.

765
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:26,732
I don't really know what I would have done
if I were in his place.

766
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:34,338
Mmm. That smells fabulous.

767
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:35,814
Looks like
the Dodgers are going...

768
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:39,148
- Whipped cream?
- Absolutely.

769
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:41,745
Come here. Sit down.

770
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:44,382
You big bear, you.

771
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:49,157
Will you look at that?
They're changing pitchers.

772
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:51,526
- They'll get out of it.
- Dad, they're gonna lose.

773
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:53,692
- No, don't think that way.
- You're gonna owe me $5.

774
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:56,293
- Don't forget about my soufflé.
- Unless... Let's double our bet.

775
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:57,497
- Okay.
- Okay.

776
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:22,054
- Hello?
- Is this Peter Delaney?

777
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:26,294
- Yeah.
- This is Tucker. Tucker Brennan.

778
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:31,532
I'm calling from Heber Springs.
Do you have a moment?

779
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:33,005
Sure.

780
01:18:35,811 --> 01:18:38,439
Your dad was staying with me here.

781
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:43,380
Is something wrong?

782
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:45,817
He passed away last Tuesday.

783
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:49,320
I'm sorry we didn't call you right away,

784
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:52,916
but he told me not to tell you
until it was over.

785
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:56,731
Doctors did everything they could.

786
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:58,424
It was peaceful.

787
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:03,731
We buried him here next to your mother.

788
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:52,815
- Peter? Ann Monohan.
- Ann.

789
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:55,447
Please, come in.

790
01:20:01,897 --> 01:20:04,388
I've been thinking about calling Izzy,

791
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:07,901
and I can't.

792
01:20:08,003 --> 01:20:10,437
Why do you think that is?

793
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:19,811
I'm afraid I'll make a mess of things.

794
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:21,473
A mess?

795
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:24,848
I have an aversion to messy situations.

796
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:27,387
What does messy mean to you?

797
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:29,450
Chaos.

798
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:34,023
Ugliness.

799
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,393
Failure.

800
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,433
How does failure come into it?

801
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,525
I loathe failure.

802
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:45,037
I loathe it in others,
but most of all in myself.

803
01:20:45,707 --> 01:20:48,039
Why such a strong reaction?

804
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,404
It's part of life, failure, isn't it?

805
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:58,311
Yeah.

806
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:02,981
Do you know...

807
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:08,225
You know that I cleaned the studio that day.

808
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:13,124
You know that I...

809
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:16,794
That I opened the window.

810
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:24,373
- See, it was my fault.
- Why was it your fault?

811
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,879
That window is never open.

812
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:30,076
If I hadn't opened it,
he wouldn't have come in.

813
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:33,687
Maybe he would have smashed the window.

814
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:38,225
Yeah, but maybe if I hadn't left it open...

815
01:21:41,296 --> 01:21:43,924
God, he just wouldn't have come in.

816
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:50,338
- Can I tell you a story?
- Yeah.

817
01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:52,633
I saw this boy once.

818
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:57,504
He had an acute fear of swimming in pools.

819
01:21:58,647 --> 01:22:03,243
He was so terrified of sharks.
He saw them in the pool.

820
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:05,683
And we worked together for a while,

821
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:08,347
and after a time he seemed to be better.

822
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,789
Years later, I ran into him,

823
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:14,453
and I could tell he was an athlete.

824
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:17,463
I asked him what he was doing.

825
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,697
He told me he was captain of the swim team.

826
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:29,775
I said, "I guess then
you're no longer afraid of sharks?"

827
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:32,947
You know what he said?

828
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:37,684
"The sharks are still there.

829
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:39,549
"I just out-swim them."

830
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:47,026
You never know what a person will do
with impediments,

831
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:51,087
and sometimes adversity
has unseen benefits.

832
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:25,755
Peter, by the time you get this,
I'll be gone.

833
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:31,001
I was a terrible husband
and a failure as a father, too,

834
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:35,164
maybe to the last
because I chose not to warn you.

835
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:39,704
But I couldn't face it,
giving you anymore pain, I mean.

836
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:43,741
These albums are all I have to offer you,

837
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:47,954
but I loved them, and I love you.

838
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:52,691
I hope you can forgive me. Dad.

839
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:56,579
Hi.

840
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:58,614
Hi.

841
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:01,722
You wanna come in?

842
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,188
Sure.

843
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:11,938
- I got a show.
- Really?

844
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,769
Yeah. A little one.

845
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,737
I knew you would.

846
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:21,642
You wanna sit?

847
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:23,478
I'm only gonna stay a minute.

848
01:25:23,585 --> 01:25:24,643
Yeah.

849
01:25:28,223 --> 01:25:31,124
There's something I've been wanting to say.

850
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:51,037
You know that window,

851
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:55,412
the window he came in.

852
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:01,211
- I opened it.
- I know.

853
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:04,586
But I left it open.

854
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:09,887
Neither of us is to blame.

855
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:12,390
He was to blame.

856
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,837
I thought I was being punished.

857
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:19,770
- For what?
- Everything.

858
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:25,008
Copying my arithmetic homework
from my best friend in the third grade,

859
01:26:25,113 --> 01:26:28,344
lying to my mom when I stayed out late,

860
01:26:28,449 --> 01:26:31,441
hating my little brother when he was born,

861
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:33,350
wishing he would die.

862
01:26:33,655 --> 01:26:35,020
Then he did.

863
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:44,762
Where'd you get those?

864
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:50,362
Dad.

865
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:55,842
Smoking finally got him
by way of a broken heart.

866
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:00,938
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

867
01:27:04,852 --> 01:27:06,149
I'm sorry.

868
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:18,732
I'm sorry I was so difficult.

869
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,131
You have nothing to apologize for.

870
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,294
I do.

871
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:27,937
What happened in a way, it was a test,
and I failed.

872
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:30,772
I wasn't big enough.

873
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:48,258
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.

874
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,032
Izzy.

875
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:07,774
Why did you come?

876
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:10,283
To thank you.

877
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:12,648
For what?

878
01:28:14,155 --> 01:28:15,952
Sending me my camera.

879
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:19,923
Oh.

880
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,216
I generally don't like a large format.

881
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:51,986
That reminds me of Richter.

882
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:54,091
- Really?
- Yeah.

883
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:58,331
She's just magnificent.

884
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,863
I am so proud of her.

885
01:29:06,774 --> 01:29:08,742
Here. Hold this a second.

886
01:29:16,217 --> 01:29:18,185
I have something for you.

887
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,510
It's beautiful.

888
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:26,390
I love you.

889
01:29:44,946 --> 01:29:47,471
- No, I'm telling you...
- So he called me at noon.

890
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:49,944
- Noon.
- I think that's fabulous.

891
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:51,109
- Can you believe that?
- Yeah.

892
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:53,881
- I shouldn't even give him a second chance.
- No.

893
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:22,673
- Hi.
- Hi.

894
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:30,354
It's great.

895
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:33,889
- Do you want me to show you?
- Yeah. Yeah.

896
01:30:34,862 --> 01:30:37,160
- Your dad?
- Yeah. He liked it.

897
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:40,861
- I never thought he'd show up.
- Why not?

898
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:44,969
I always thought he was a bit of a coward.

899
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:47,202
No more than the rest of us.

900
01:30:47,308 --> 01:30:48,775
I'm no coward.

901
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:51,136
- That's the truth.
- Hmm.

902
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:05,091
Thanks for coming.

903
01:31:05,193 --> 01:31:07,320
The show was just an excuse.

904
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:11,993
I'm going to Europe.

905
01:31:16,971 --> 01:31:18,438
Come with me.

906
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:20,934
I can't.

907
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:23,504
Why not?

908
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:25,946
I just can't.

909
01:31:27,381 --> 01:31:29,372
We're not the same people.

910
01:31:34,455 --> 01:31:35,547
Okay.

911
01:31:40,127 --> 01:31:41,924
I think you're right.

912
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:46,256
We're not the same people.

913
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:48,561
I know.

914
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:51,199
We're better, Izzy.

915
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:56,667
Just to live through that, to get through it,
is an accomplishment.

916
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:01,474
I love you more now than I ever did,

917
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:05,678
and losing you twice, I think I'd die.

918
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:10,817
- I don't think I could take it, either.
- Well, let's not. Come with me.

919
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:13,223
Italy is beautiful this time of the year.

920
01:32:13,327 --> 01:32:15,795
The Lago di Como is waiting for us.

921
01:32:16,163 --> 01:32:18,563
- I think you should...
- "I think."

922
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:20,634
No more thinking allowed.

923
01:32:35,349 --> 01:32:37,317
No more thinking allowed.
