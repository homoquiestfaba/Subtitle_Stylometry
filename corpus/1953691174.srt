00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:11,434
Son of a bitch!

3
00:00:11,435 --> 00:00:15,304
Man, this has gotta be the
one. It's kicking my ass.

4
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:16,528
Twenty minutes till midnight.

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,516
Doesn't matter how big this thing is
if we don't get it in before deadline.

6
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:22,151
No one's gonna notice if
I'm a few minutes over.

7
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:25,221
I would. You know the rules, Brubaker.

8
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:28,892
The rodeo ends at midnight. You don't
land it before then, it don't count.

9
00:00:28,893 --> 00:00:32,036
Yeah, well, I'm gonna land it all
right, and then I'm gonna turn around

10
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:35,292
and change it in for that check with
my name on it back at the Marina.

11
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:40,562
We are gonna catch the biggest
Amberjack that this town has ever seen.

12
00:00:40,563 --> 00:00:44,240
How do you know it's not a
Grouper or a Marlin, or a tire?

13
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:47,480
If I want any lip from you,
I'd pull down your panties.

14
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:50,601
- Ooh! Daddy.
- Yeah.

15
00:00:53,822 --> 00:00:59,722
Hey, honey can you put that damn
camera down and wet my reel here for me?

16
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:02,826
Yeah, that's better. Thank you. Yeah.

17
00:01:02,827 --> 00:01:05,351
What are we gonna do
with that $30,000, pop?

18
00:01:05,352 --> 00:01:06,533
We're gonna buy a boat.

19
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,007
- Oh, yes.
- No more charters.

20
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:12,657
I'm tired of Captain Crunch up
there breathing down my neck.

21
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:14,581
- Look, look, look.
- Oh, daddy.

22
00:01:14,582 --> 00:01:18,123
Getting closer. Get the
gaff, honey. Get the gaff.

23
00:01:18,124 --> 00:01:19,924
Oh!

24
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:21,362
No, no, no switch!

25
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:23,977
Come on now. You gotta hold on
to this. It's a fighter. Hold on.

26
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:25,849
- I got it! Yeah!
- Keep reeling now.

27
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,799
- This ain't no Girl Scout picnic. Come on.
- I know. I know.

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,554
Reel it in. It's getting
closer. You got it?

29
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:33,456
Oh, don't screw this up now.

30
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:34,738
Come on. Yeah.

31
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:37,694
- I can see it!
- Yeah!

32
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:40,125
- I can see it! Argh!
- Hey. Whoa. Whoa!

33
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:42,286
My fish!

34
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,334
Oh! That fish ate my fish!

35
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:49,891
You cost me $30,000, you son of a bitch!

36
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:55,013
Sorry, folks. Guess you'll have to
wait till next year to win one of these.

37
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:58,238
Just hope your friend
isn't waiting for you too.

38
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,705
Oh, I'll make sure he isn't.

39
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:04,160
Oh-ho-ho-ho, yeah.

40
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:06,261
Uh-huh.

41
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,920
Yeah! You eat this, you mother!

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,844
No guns on my boat, damn it!

43
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:17,500
You're done, Brubaker!

44
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:19,361
Aah!

45
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:28,451
Don't just stand there. We
got us a Great White to kill.

46
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,685
- Whoa! Be careful. Be careful.
- Ouch!

47
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:41,401
- You okay? All right.
- Yes.

48
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:45,161
Look, I'm gonna give this shark
$30,000 worth of pain now, okay?

49
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:46,903
- Okay.
- Give me that. You take this.

50
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:49,471
And go get me my damn hot sauce.

51
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,332
Ugh.

52
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:00,849
Come on, Sally tuna.

53
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,326
Hot sauce, daddy!

54
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:07,496
Here you go, you son of a bitch!

55
00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:10,377
I hope that hurts!

56
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:12,994
You cost me $30,000!

57
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:16,415
Smile you son of a bitch!

58
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:19,907
- Yes siree!
- Ah!

59
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:38,692
Have you lost your damn mind?

60
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:40,999
This ain't fishing! It's
barbaric! It's criminal!

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,320
- I should have both of you arrested!
- That fish ate...

62
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:49,221
One more word out of you, and
you'll be swimming back to shore!

63
00:03:56,634 --> 00:04:02,534
- You killed him good, pop.
- It was almost worth losing the money.

64
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:40,762
- You want me to try...
- Shut up!

65
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:46,798
Ladies and gentlemen, the Great White
Shark, nature's perfect killing machine...

66
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:49,308
Until me and my daddy...

67
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:52,009
Whipped his ass!

68
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:55,339
Victoria!

69
00:04:57,695 --> 00:04:59,495
Oh!

70
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:03,837
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

71
00:05:03,967 --> 00:05:07,103
Help me! Help me! God! Don't let go!

72
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:09,624
Help! No! No!

73
00:06:25,548 --> 00:06:28,368
You got six feet.

74
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:34,966
Almost. Almost. All right. All
right. That's it. That's it.

75
00:06:35,126 --> 00:06:38,786
Would you look at that water!

76
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,181
Hey, dude, you gonna let me
bust the cherry on your jet ski?

77
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:44,633
Hell, no. Nobody's riding it but me.

78
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:46,496
Come on, man. I'm not gonna scratch it.

79
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:48,437
- You'll never get the chance.
- Come on!

80
00:06:48,438 --> 00:06:50,313
Unless you hook me up
with your little sister.

81
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:52,938
That's not gonna happen dude,
she thinks you're a total jackass.

82
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:54,275
Then I guess you're out of luck.

83
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:56,913
I don't think anyone's gonna
be looking at your eyes, Taylor.

84
00:06:56,914 --> 00:07:02,118
Ava, honey, I told you, it's
all about the total package.

85
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:05,978
You're never gonna get anywhere with
your prude mood or that hideous swimsuit.

86
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:08,826
Where'd you get that thing
anyway, your grandmother's closet?

87
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:09,911
What's wrong with it?

88
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:12,695
Nothing, if you're
trying to stay a virgin.

89
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:15,531
Blaise, what do you think of Ava's suit?

90
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,606
I think it's really nice.

91
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:21,904
Don't listen to him, horny
boys will say anything.

92
00:07:21,905 --> 00:07:24,673
What about mine? Maxim material?

93
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:27,009
Maxim-um jail bait.

94
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,292
Jail bait? What does that mean?

95
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:31,980
It means he's not interested in
little girls with criminal records.

96
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:35,296
Ava! Breaking and entering.
We're all so proud.

97
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:38,120
It's called curiosity. I
wasn't going to steal anything.

98
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:43,826
Hey, just think. One day, your
curiosity can be tried as an adult.

99
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:45,728
- Whoops.
- You little...

100
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:49,098
I'm gonna get you. You better run.

101
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:52,279
Kid should be arrested.

102
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:47,321
I got you something.

103
00:09:15,185 --> 00:09:17,045
Aah.

104
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,571
Ladies and gentlemen,
this state-of-the-art hotel

105
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:30,032
is the first step to bolstering our
economy in our new Smallport initiative.

106
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:32,641
As Mayor, it is my
personal mission to ensure

107
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:37,622
that Smallport becomes
the state's number one...

108
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,176
Woo!

109
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:43,579
This is the greatest
day of my life! Woo!

110
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,550
Come on. Let me get on
the jet ski. Come on.

111
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:49,952
- They make such a cute couple.
- How come you're not out there?

112
00:09:49,953 --> 00:09:52,330
- I don't swim.
- Don't or can't?

113
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:56,344
- There's a big difference.
- I don't swim.

114
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,703
- What's your sister's excuse?
- Why?

115
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:00,762
You have a crush on her, don't you?

116
00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:02,431
So what if I do?

117
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:05,267
She's only the most boring
person who ever lived.

118
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:07,048
- Cicely.
- What up?

119
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:08,737
Check it out.

120
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,306
It's Dad's boat.

121
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:13,487
Oh, yeah. That's cool.

122
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:18,027
Did he have a charter today?

123
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:20,188
Why don't you call him?

124
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:23,159
- What's wrong?
- She's always tripping.

125
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,960
Can you hand me my phone? Please?

126
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:27,533
I'm telling you.

127
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:29,814
Thank you.

128
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:34,061
You have reached 850-99...

129
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:36,928
Straight to voice mail.
Where the hell is he?

130
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:38,647
He's probably just down in the cabin.

131
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:40,836
No. He never leaves the wheel.

132
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,872
Looks like it's drifting
into that dock a little bit.

133
00:10:43,873 --> 00:10:47,046
Let me up on the jet ski
now. Come on. Let me up there.

134
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:51,310
- Wanna check it out? I'll race you.
- No, no, just chill okay?

135
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:54,016
We'll wait till Cameron
gets back from the jet ski.

136
00:10:54,017 --> 00:10:55,937
Lame.

137
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:59,408
Seriously? I just bought those.

138
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,529
Well, that's too bad.

139
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:05,827
Yes! This is absolutely awesome!

140
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:07,688
Aah!

141
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,350
- Woo!
- Yes!

142
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:13,844
Whoa!

143
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:16,905
Where are they going?

144
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:33,281
Just once it would be nice
if you would listen to me.

145
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:35,224
You just hate that I beat you.

146
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:37,085
Dad?

147
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:39,067
Dad!

148
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:41,408
Oh my God.

149
00:11:42,812 --> 00:11:44,672
Dad?

150
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:49,505
Is that Dad's?

151
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:52,386
I don't think so.

152
00:11:58,707 --> 00:12:01,167
But this is.

153
00:12:26,343 --> 00:12:29,463
Cut it out, dumb ass.

154
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:35,181
Seriously? What the hell?

155
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:39,988
You son of a bitch! Cameron!

156
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:43,709
Woo! I'm on a jet ski! Whoa!

157
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:48,763
Oh, my God!

158
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:54,136
- Why is Taylor freaking out?
- Maybe she lost her bikini.

159
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:56,897
I'll rescue her.

160
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,808
Not cool, man! Not cool!

161
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:02,413
It is what it is!

162
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,334
Yeah!

163
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:11,432
Oh, my God! Shark!

164
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:17,526
- Need a lift?
- Shark!

165
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:20,229
Please. You really think
I was gonna fall for that?

166
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,158
Come on, baby.

167
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,206
- Get us out of here!
- Well, what are you gonna give me?

168
00:13:25,207 --> 00:13:27,007
Oh!

169
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:32,548
Damn it, Taylor! Nobody
rides that thing but me!

170
00:13:43,563 --> 00:13:46,689
So much for being the only one
that gets to use the jet ski!

171
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,710
- Can I have a shot now?
- Shark!

172
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,279
Ah!

173
00:14:06,476 --> 00:14:09,716
What the hell was that?

174
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,283
Oh, my God! Mick, get
your ass outta there!

175
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:16,889
Move! Move! Come on! Go!

176
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,588
Come on! Get outta there!

177
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,824
Oh, my God. Oh, my
God. Mick, get up here.

178
00:14:22,825 --> 00:14:25,461
Ava, get him out. Hurry! Oh, my God.

179
00:14:25,462 --> 00:14:27,387
Catch! Hurry!

180
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:29,128
Mick!

181
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:33,029
Oh, my gosh. Hurry. Pull him up.

182
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:42,244
- Didn't somebody see her?
- Please calm down.

183
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:44,413
- We're doing everything we can.
- Where's my daughter?

184
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:46,982
- We're doing all we can.
- Where is she? Is this all...

185
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:48,717
Something got her in the water.

186
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:51,287
- We don't know that.
- Oh, my God!

187
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:54,296
- Oh, my God! Not our little girl!
- Let us do our job.

188
00:14:54,297 --> 00:14:57,837
Please, not our little girl!

189
00:14:58,195 --> 00:14:59,897
- Well, where was Taylor?
- We don't know.

190
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:02,418
Hey Ava, hey!

191
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:05,846
Help me out here. You seem like
you got your head on straight.

192
00:15:05,847 --> 00:15:06,735
He doesn't believe us.

193
00:15:06,736 --> 00:15:09,505
I can believe your friend may
have been eaten by a shark.

194
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:12,775
It's the description of that shark
that I am having a hard time with.

195
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:14,710
I told you, it was translucent.

196
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:17,513
"Translucent". The word of the day.

197
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:20,473
When you say "translucent,"
you mean like a jellyfish?

198
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:24,152
- Meaning we could see right through it.
- I know what the damn word means.

199
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:26,702
It was like something
I've never seen before.

200
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:32,093
I got a missing teenage girl, presumed
dead, and a boat... no occupants.

201
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:34,631
I was really hoping you
could help me out here.

202
00:15:34,632 --> 00:15:36,923
- Dad's dead too.
- You don't know that for sure.

203
00:15:36,924 --> 00:15:39,892
- No reason to lose hope yet.
- He's dead, Taylor's dead...

204
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:41,543
There was blood all over the transom.

205
00:15:41,544 --> 00:15:45,638
Aw, hell. I caught a Marlin
once. Bled all over the deck.

206
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,439
Left a mess not unlike your Dad's boat.

207
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,924
Amberjack rodeo was last night.
Maybe reeled in a big one.

208
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:51,613
But the difference is you're still here.

209
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:55,814
You think ghosts are logical, Sheriff?

210
00:15:59,422 --> 00:16:01,688
Who said anything about ghosts, Finch?

211
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:02,825
I did.

212
00:16:02,826 --> 00:16:06,862
You know, that's the trouble
with people like you, Sheriff.

213
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:11,257
Never wanna deal with the
truth till it's too late.

214
00:16:11,258 --> 00:16:13,267
Ghosts are real.

215
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:16,727
As real as the lies
this town was built on.

216
00:16:16,728 --> 00:16:19,347
As real as the price we're
gonna pay for those sins.

217
00:16:19,348 --> 00:16:23,117
You mark my words. You mark my words.

218
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:29,018
Well, maybe if you dried out occasionally,
your words might actually mean something.

219
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:36,474
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know, Ava.

220
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:39,694
Look, I'm putting a missing person's
report out on your father, and your friend.

221
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:42,693
In the meantime, I'm calling
your Aunt Marge to come get you.

222
00:16:42,694 --> 00:16:46,174
We'll be fine on our own.

223
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,412
- Cameron!
- Dad!

224
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:52,981
- One more time. You were on the jet ski.
- I was on a jet ski...

225
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:55,265
You okay, son? What happened?

226
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:58,802
I don't know. Taylor was screaming about
a shark, and the next minute she was gone.

227
00:16:58,803 --> 00:17:01,323
There hasn't been a shark attack
in Smallport in over 20 years.

228
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:02,965
- Are you sure?
- You should've seen it.

229
00:17:02,966 --> 00:17:04,645
- Good Lord, Cameron.
- It looked like...

230
00:17:04,646 --> 00:17:06,938
A shark scare will put
this town welfare by winter.

231
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,404
- Are you absolutely sure, son?
- Uh...

232
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:13,137
Hold on. Sheriff! Come here please.

233
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:16,694
Put a $1,000 bounty on all
sharks in the bay. Keep it quiet.

234
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:19,415
Last thing we need is a
media-feeding frenzy around here.

235
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,370
Draw up some signs. It should say
"beaches are closed for 24 hours".

236
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:23,239
Got it.

237
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,551
If I have to do a press
conference about a shark attack.

238
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:27,567
I'd better be standing
next to a dead one.

239
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:29,469
- All right, all right.
- You understand?

240
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,866
- Got it.
- Come on, son.

241
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:32,707
What?

242
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,233
Hiring a bunch of shark bounty
hunters isn't gonna do anything.

243
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:37,892
Just let us handle this.
Try and get some sleep.

244
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:39,751
Sheriff can I get with
you for a minute please?

245
00:17:39,752 --> 00:17:41,794
Think about what you actually saw.

246
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,782
We'll pick this up again tomorrow.

247
00:17:44,783 --> 00:17:46,598
Hey.

248
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,536
Let me bring you home.

249
00:17:48,537 --> 00:17:49,716
- No.
- Please?

250
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:52,666
Really, it's okay. We'll walk.

251
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:56,267
- You sure?
- Yeah. Come on.

252
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:34,336
- That's where it cuts off.
- Play it again.

253
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:37,613
How do I play the damn thing back?

254
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:39,534
Here.

255
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:43,573
My daddy whipped his ass!

256
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,730
There.

257
00:19:46,742 --> 00:19:48,990
That's definitely the shark I saw.

258
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:50,926
One eye, and a hole in it's fin.

259
00:19:50,927 --> 00:19:52,859
That's definitely the
shark that tried to eat me.

260
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,914
So the shark that we saw...
you could see through.

261
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:56,448
Are we on this again?

262
00:19:56,449 --> 00:19:58,303
Ever heard of an optical illusion?

263
00:19:58,304 --> 00:19:59,938
The shark was dead. They killed it.

264
00:19:59,939 --> 00:20:02,347
Or temporarily dazed.
Or playing possum, maybe.

265
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:06,205
And you can't explain how a shark killed
three people on the deck of a boat.

266
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:11,124
In police work, the simplest
explanation is usually the right one.

267
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,768
A couple of yahoos got
a Great White riled up.

268
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:16,048
Your father paid the price for it.

269
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,587
Let's give it a few more days.

270
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:20,158
Ava, if nothing turns up

271
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,529
I'll reach out ot the community give your
daddy the kind of service he deserves.

272
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,485
I really appreciate that, Sheriff,

273
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:30,507
but the shark that killed Taylor and
my Dad was not your average shark.

274
00:20:30,508 --> 00:20:32,412
I understand how upset you are,

275
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:35,300
but you are really gonna
have to let us do our job.

276
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,885
Maybe he's right, Ava. I mean,
the way that the shark looked,

277
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:39,971
it could've been a
reflection of the sun.

278
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,607
Is your Dad paying you to say that?

279
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,809
- Sheriff Martin, line 1.
- That's not fair.

280
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,045
- We were pretty far away.
- Martin.

281
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:49,855
- I know I didn't get a very good look.
- At the Marina?

282
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:51,984
You check the bars?

283
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,452
Nah, nah. I'll be right down.

284
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,821
Ava, listen to your friends.

285
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:59,124
You don't wanna wind up like Finch.

286
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:03,228
- Can we get something to eat?
- Damn it! The pool party!

287
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:06,577
People are gonna start showing
up to my house any minute now.

288
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:08,242
Sorry.

289
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:10,830
I told everybody to invite anybody.

290
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:13,116
Do you know who's gonna be
showing up to this thing?

291
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:14,792
Man this is stupid.

292
00:21:14,793 --> 00:21:17,599
The only way this thing is gonna
get canceled is with a SWAT team.

293
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,615
My sister's sorority friends
are driving in from Houston.

294
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:25,536
- What are you talking about?
- The pool party.

295
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,221
What if we turned it into a memorial?

296
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:31,142
Yeah.

297
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:35,898
You're seriously talking about a party?

298
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:39,498
Let's get out of here.

299
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:41,659
Come on.

300
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:49,274
Don't worry about those guys, all
right? They're just being jerks.

301
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,343
Look, what do you wanna do right now?

302
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,233
Go home.

303
00:21:53,234 --> 00:21:55,180
I don't think y'all should be alone.

304
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,984
Why don't you let me take you and
Cicely, and we'll go do something?

305
00:21:57,985 --> 00:22:00,219
- We'll get something to eat.
- Please.

306
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,240
I know you mean well, but no way.

307
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,776
Will you at least just
promise me that you'll

308
00:22:09,777 --> 00:22:11,715
text me or call me if you need anything?

309
00:22:11,716 --> 00:22:14,836
Anything. I'm serious.

310
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:20,931
I'll call you later.

311
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:45,965
Finch.

312
00:22:45,966 --> 00:22:48,371
That guy really creeps
me out. He's a freak.

313
00:22:48,372 --> 00:22:49,781
- Shh!
- What are you doing?

314
00:22:49,782 --> 00:22:51,436
- Mr. Finch.
- Ava!

315
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:54,143
- Do you got a moment to talk?
- What do you want?

316
00:22:54,144 --> 00:22:56,303
Sheriff send you out here
to spy on me or something?

317
00:22:56,304 --> 00:22:58,844
No. Why would he wanna do that?

318
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:00,462
I didn't see nothing.

319
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,285
But you're the lighthouse keeper, right?

320
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:03,693
What's that supposed to mean?

321
00:23:03,694 --> 00:23:06,811
You think everything that happens
off the coast is my responsibility?

322
00:23:06,812 --> 00:23:10,116
Of course not. But yesterday,
you were talking like...

323
00:23:10,117 --> 00:23:13,897
You knew something about ghosts.

324
00:23:20,757 --> 00:23:23,397
Leave me alone!

325
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:28,239
I told you that guy was creepy.

326
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,720
He's also hiding something.

327
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:54,700
Hand me those beers.

328
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:57,036
- Hey, Chad.
- Oh, what's up, Catherine, baby?

329
00:23:57,037 --> 00:23:59,471
Give me some sugar.

330
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:01,741
This is gonna be awesome!

331
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:06,079
That thing had to be at least 30 feet
long, and it swallowed Taylor whole.

332
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,304
Oh, my God. You must've been
so scared. What did you do?

333
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:12,365
Well, I had my diving knife, and
I started stabbing that thing!

334
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:15,548
Gash, gash, gash! Went all
Michael Myers on that bitch.

335
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:17,830
But then it was too late to save Taylor.

336
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:21,911
- You're so brave.
- Salut, ladies.

337
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:30,302
Hey, ass clown!

338
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,704
I didn't think you were
gonna make it here tonight.

339
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,885
Come here. Talk to me.

340
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:53,676
Belly bomb!

341
00:24:57,194 --> 00:24:58,918
What the hell are you doing, man?

342
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,698
Worried about your phone getting wet?

343
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,027
- Get off of me!
- Don't have the warranty?

344
00:25:03,028 --> 00:25:05,671
Yo man, get off! Get off!

345
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,535
You need to cool down, man.

346
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:10,379
- What are you doing?
- Have some fun here.

347
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,240
Emily. This is gonna
help cheer you up, okay?

348
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:17,966
Feast your eyes.

349
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:29,273
Enjoy yourself!

350
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,225
Son of a bitch!

351
00:25:42,226 --> 00:25:46,066
Man, this has gotta be the one.

352
00:26:00,344 --> 00:26:01,742
Will you get that?

353
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:04,923
You get it! I'm busy.

354
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:12,637
- Hi.
- Hi.

355
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,806
I tried calling you... before.

356
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,735
Oh. I was...

357
00:26:16,736 --> 00:26:19,796
- Hey, Blaise.
- Hey.

358
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:25,374
You were right about the party.
It was stupid I... I shouldn't...

359
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,830
I um...

360
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:29,250
It was a dumb idea to
try to have fun right now.

361
00:26:29,251 --> 00:26:31,621
This is not the right time for that.

362
00:26:31,622 --> 00:26:32,724
I'm sorry.

363
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:35,861
Well, I'm glad you came.
I wanna show you something.

364
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:38,801
- Daddy whipped his ass!
- How did you get this?

365
00:26:38,802 --> 00:26:41,218
I stole it from the Sheriff's
computer while he was talking.

366
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:42,665
Victoria!

367
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:44,466
Ow!

368
00:26:45,214 --> 00:26:47,679
Pretty ballsy.

369
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,409
- Take my hand!
- Doesn't bother you to be watching this?

370
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,910
There. That's not a solid figure, is it?

371
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:57,316
You're seeing this, aren't you?

372
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:58,750
Yeah, I'm seeing it.

373
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:03,191
But I'm not the one you gotta convince.

374
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,688
Yeah!

375
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:28,623
Those two ass-clowns...
we're ass-clowns?

376
00:27:28,624 --> 00:27:33,004
You're a ass clown. He's a ass clown.

377
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:40,559
Man, get that crap on out of here!

378
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:46,776
Don't do it over here and be
messing up my party like that, man!

379
00:27:46,777 --> 00:27:48,995
- What?
- Get that crap outta my house!

380
00:27:48,996 --> 00:27:53,316
Now I'm doing a gainer in your house.

381
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:25,419
Oh, my God! Did you guys just see that?

382
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,724
Mick! I'm coming, bro!

383
00:28:31,725 --> 00:28:33,406
You gotta get me outta here!

384
00:28:33,407 --> 00:28:35,108
Come on! Look! I'm right here!

385
00:28:35,109 --> 00:28:36,616
Come on, buddy! Mick, I got you!

386
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:38,607
- Come on, come on!
- I can't! Can you pull me up?

387
00:28:38,608 --> 00:28:40,323
- You pull yourself!
- I can't!

388
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:42,097
Yes, you can! Don't tell me you can't!

389
00:28:42,098 --> 00:28:44,984
I got you, but you
gotta help! Mick! Mick!

390
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:47,520
Mick, please! Mick!

391
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:50,161
Mick, no! Mick!

392
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,109
Hello?

393
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,987
- Ava, Mick's dead.
- Who is it?

394
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:20,163
We were all having fun at the party,
and all of a sudden Mick was in the pool,

395
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:22,887
and he was reaching for me I'm
trying to get him out, but he's gone.

396
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:26,668
Look, get over here quick. Bye.

397
00:29:27,525 --> 00:29:29,445
What?

398
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:32,698
What is it?

399
00:30:01,665 --> 00:30:03,363
I don't know what happened here,

400
00:30:03,364 --> 00:30:06,354
but the stories you and the
others are saying makes no sense.

401
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:09,299
You gotta start telling
me the truth right now.

402
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,234
What type of drugs was y'all on?

403
00:30:11,235 --> 00:30:13,236
Bath salts? P.C.P.?

404
00:30:13,237 --> 00:30:15,906
Did y'all take a bad trip and
start gnawing on each other?

405
00:30:15,907 --> 00:30:18,241
You gotta tell me. That's the
only way I can protect you.

406
00:30:18,242 --> 00:30:19,162
It was the shark, Dad.

407
00:30:19,163 --> 00:30:21,540
- That one from the beach.
- Stop saying it was the shark.

408
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:24,123
- It's the truth! Why won't you believe me?
- It's not that I don't believe you.

409
00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:25,966
But if you keep spouting
off with that nonsense,

410
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:27,786
not even I can stop them from
putting you in the loony bin.

411
00:30:27,787 --> 00:30:29,577
Really, you worried about
me or the next election?

412
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,385
What?

413
00:30:30,386 --> 00:30:31,928
You worried about me
or the next election?

414
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:33,211
Look, don't put this back on me.

415
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:35,492
We got a bunch of mutilated
bodies in our yard,

416
00:30:35,493 --> 00:30:38,616
and the authorities want
answers now son, now!

417
00:30:38,617 --> 00:30:40,542
You wait right there, don't you move.

418
00:30:40,543 --> 00:30:42,256
Sheriff...

419
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,134
Don't you move.

420
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:46,519
You got a second?

421
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,538
Excuse me.

422
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:50,759
Sheriff...

423
00:30:51,041 --> 00:30:53,643
Bring Cameron down, put
him in an isolated cell.

424
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:56,012
Till he starts talking,
sober up, or both.

425
00:30:56,013 --> 00:30:58,648
It's for his own safety.
But do it quietly.

426
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,798
Last thing I need around
here is rumors going around

427
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,952
saying that he's responsible
for this hell of a mess.

428
00:31:02,953 --> 00:31:04,477
- Okay.
- Thank you, Sheriff.

429
00:31:04,478 --> 00:31:07,288
Cameron, Cameron, what happened?

430
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:09,526
It got Mick's man.

431
00:31:09,527 --> 00:31:12,162
It got him and tore him to pieces.

432
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:13,929
Where did it come from?

433
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,603
Cameron, why don't you
take a ride with me?

434
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:18,769
- What for?
- He just wanna take a ride with you, son.

435
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,469
Just want to ask you some questions.

436
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:21,671
I didn't do anything.

437
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:24,340
We know you didn't. Maybe you
can help us figure out who did.

438
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:26,952
Why don't you ask the other
witnesses who were here what they saw?

439
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:29,323
I don't have time to listen
to this nonsense anymore, Ava.

440
00:31:29,324 --> 00:31:31,238
It's not nonsense! It's fact!

441
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:34,143
A fact that's gonna swim up and bite
you in the ass if you don't wake up!

442
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:37,120
Shut up! We appreciate your concern.

443
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:40,557
With that being said, you better get
outta my sight before I have you locked up.

444
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:42,292
You hear me, missy? I didn't stutter.

445
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:44,740
- But you don't...
- Shut up! Stay outta my way, and stay...

446
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:46,199
- Dad...
- Shut up, son!

447
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,196
Stay away from Cameron,
and stay outta my way!

448
00:31:49,197 --> 00:31:52,357
Let's go. Get outta my way!

449
00:31:52,358 --> 00:31:55,058
Sheriff! Sheriff!

450
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:04,230
- You're gonna wanna see this.
- Oh, God.

451
00:32:04,231 --> 00:32:09,297
I, uh, found this little
number over in the bushes there.

452
00:32:09,298 --> 00:32:11,053
And...

453
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,324
Here's something you're not
gonna see on Discovery Channel.

454
00:32:14,325 --> 00:32:16,809
My house! Now I'm doing
a gainer in your house.

455
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,163
What is... mmm.

456
00:32:19,164 --> 00:32:21,100
- That can't be real.
- Oh, it's real.

457
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:23,621
Are you sure?

458
00:32:23,731 --> 00:32:25,164
Goodness gracious!

459
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:27,552
I don't know how that guy
got elected. He's a total ass.

460
00:32:27,553 --> 00:32:29,742
- Tell me about it.
- You all right?

461
00:32:29,743 --> 00:32:32,683
I'm fine. And you?

462
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:41,749
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!

463
00:32:41,862 --> 00:32:43,760
- Go! Go!
- Yes, this is happening now.

464
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:47,481
- Hurry up.
- Cameron! Cameron!

465
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:52,591
I'm gonna beat you like
you stole something!

466
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:39,307
Don't spray me.

467
00:33:52,895 --> 00:33:55,055
Stop it!

468
00:33:56,594 --> 00:33:59,894
Do you want a car wash?

469
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:23,698
Hey, sexy.

470
00:34:30,127 --> 00:34:32,047
Geez.

471
00:34:32,296 --> 00:34:34,456
Come on.

472
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:37,071
Aw, hell.

473
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:51,239
My turn.

474
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:01,861
Mom, help!

475
00:35:20,042 --> 00:35:21,902
Woo!

476
00:35:58,048 --> 00:36:01,085
This is only the latest in a
string of mysterious killings

477
00:36:01,086 --> 00:36:04,328
that have terrorized Smallport
over the last 48 hours.

478
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,787
Thirteen people are reported dead.

479
00:36:06,788 --> 00:36:09,629
Meanwhile, there are
swarms of rumors about

480
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,995
an unidentified animal that may
have attacked in these cases.

481
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:16,101
Police say they are trying
to find three crucial victims

482
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:18,603
who could be vital in
solving this case...

483
00:36:18,604 --> 00:36:23,359
Ava Reid, Blaise Parker, and Cameron
Stahl, who's the son of Mayor Frank Stahl.

484
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,658
Were witnesses to the fatal shark attack

485
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:28,244
in an area ironically
nicknamed Dead Man's Point.

486
00:36:28,245 --> 00:36:33,825
Which began this bizarre
cycle of violence two days ago.

487
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:11,174
No trespassing!

488
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,683
Damn it.

489
00:37:34,384 --> 00:37:36,364
Hello!

490
00:37:36,613 --> 00:37:38,221
Can't you read?

491
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:41,051
This area's off-limits!

492
00:37:41,052 --> 00:37:43,512
You in here?

493
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,057
Hey!

494
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:52,618
You come out now, I won't call the cops!

495
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:07,835
Judas priest.

496
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:19,371
What is this dude
possibly gonna do for us?

497
00:38:19,372 --> 00:38:21,204
We need proof that we're not nuts.

498
00:38:21,205 --> 00:38:23,352
So we go see the nuttiest guy in town?

499
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:25,920
Might as well strap me
to the electric chair now.

500
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:27,296
You didn't have to come.

501
00:38:27,297 --> 00:38:30,232
I'm starting to wish I didn't.

502
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:32,668
Why do y'all wanna
go to that lighthouse?

503
00:38:32,669 --> 00:38:34,770
There's probably snakes
and stuff out here.

504
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,906
Ava, wait up.

505
00:38:36,907 --> 00:38:39,876
- You guys really think this is cool?
- Just keep an eye out.

506
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:42,409
- What? For what?
- For snakes, man.

507
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,778
Look at my shoes.

508
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:47,599
- Ugh!
- Come on.

509
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:50,279
- Ava. Ava, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- For what?

510
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,322
He's not home. We should bounce.
This is breaking and entering.

511
00:38:53,323 --> 00:38:55,253
It's just entering.
The door's already open.

512
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:57,280
Dude, that's a felony,
and I don't do felonies.

513
00:38:57,281 --> 00:38:59,051
It's a misdemeanor, baby.

514
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:01,692
- Grow a pair.
- Yeah.

515
00:39:01,693 --> 00:39:04,453
You grow a pair.

516
00:39:04,651 --> 00:39:06,631
Hello!

517
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:08,013
Hello!

518
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:11,194
Yo, Ave, check it out.

519
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:18,603
It's a basement.

520
00:39:18,604 --> 00:39:20,824
Oh, hell.

521
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:23,326
What are we coming
down here to accomplish?

522
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:28,727
Be careful before the stone
breaks this place is old.

523
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:31,648
- You complain too much, man.
- What's the whole point?

524
00:39:31,649 --> 00:39:35,189
What's your friggin' reason?

525
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,980
Come on.

526
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,910
Ava, come on.

527
00:39:42,157 --> 00:39:46,297
- Man, just shut up.
- You shut up.

528
00:39:50,241 --> 00:39:53,730
This is one creepy ass dude.

529
00:39:53,731 --> 00:39:59,191
I think this guy might have
more problems than we do.

530
00:40:00,878 --> 00:40:04,418
- Whoa!
- Don't touch that!

531
00:40:05,452 --> 00:40:07,217
Mr. Finch!

532
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:09,151
I'm sorry but your door was open.

533
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:11,621
It's still breaking and entering.

534
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:14,862
- Hey.
- Watch it, man.

535
00:40:25,803 --> 00:40:28,137
You're here about the shark, aren't you?

536
00:40:28,138 --> 00:40:30,940
So you do know what's
going on, don't you?

537
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:33,877
- Maybe.
- Well, good.

538
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:35,604
Maybe you can help us stop it.

539
00:40:35,605 --> 00:40:37,424
Stop it?

540
00:40:37,425 --> 00:40:41,654
The cave brings things back
it don't take them away.

541
00:40:41,655 --> 00:40:43,865
- Cave?
- Yes! The cave!

542
00:40:43,866 --> 00:40:46,746
Damn it! The cave!

543
00:40:57,501 --> 00:41:00,441
It's all connected.

544
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:02,458
They wanna keep it a secret.

545
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:04,841
But I know.

546
00:41:04,842 --> 00:41:07,062
Allison...

547
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:10,309
Is that you?

548
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,199
Mr. Finch?

549
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,620
Why'd he call you Alison?

550
00:41:16,855 --> 00:41:20,275
- All right. Help me lift him.
- Come on.

551
00:41:20,276 --> 00:41:26,176
- What are we gonna do with this guy?
- Let's get him onto the bed.

552
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,768
Let's get him a little further up.

553
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:34,263
Hold on. There.

554
00:41:34,264 --> 00:41:36,184
Okay.

555
00:41:41,142 --> 00:41:44,502
Dude, that was productive.

556
00:41:49,753 --> 00:41:51,698
Hey, this is Ava. Leave a message.

557
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:54,491
Where the hell are
you? The cops were here.

558
00:41:54,492 --> 00:41:56,593
They say you're interfering
with their investigation.

559
00:41:56,594 --> 00:41:59,028
They practically water-boarded me.

560
00:41:59,029 --> 00:42:04,929
Just call me or text me or something
before I have a total freak-out, okay?

561
00:42:57,222 --> 00:42:59,029
Cicely?

562
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,610
Cicely? Cicely!

563
00:43:02,996 --> 00:43:05,636
Oh, no. Cicely!

564
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,342
Come here! Come here! Come here!

565
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,310
- Are you okay?
- Come on! Come on!

566
00:43:18,311 --> 00:43:20,679
- Ow. Ow! Ow!
- What happened?

567
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,450
Come on! Come on! Go, go, go, go!

568
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:26,350
- What is it? What happened?
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

569
00:43:26,351 --> 00:43:28,187
It's so deep. Cameron, get in here!

570
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,500
- What happened?
- Ow!

571
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:31,190
- Get something to wrap it!
- This!

572
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:35,031
Grab that! Put that on her leg!

573
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:49,725
- Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!
- Calm down, ladies and gentlemen.

574
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:51,368
- Calm down.
- What is going on?

575
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:54,789
Okay, Sheriff Martin and Mayor
Stahl will be confirming...

576
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,477
- No sign of Cameron yet.
- Y'all should've found him by now.

577
00:43:57,478 --> 00:43:59,450
Paging Sheriff Martin.

578
00:43:59,451 --> 00:44:02,110
Finding your son is the least
of my concerns right now.

579
00:44:02,111 --> 00:44:04,852
We're getting more 911 calls
than the dispatcher can handle,

580
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:08,473
not that I have the deputies
respond to them all anyway.

581
00:44:08,474 --> 00:44:10,879
Maybe it's time we let people
know what we saw on that video.

582
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,458
What, and incite a mass panic?

583
00:44:12,459 --> 00:44:17,066
Frank, a car was hot-waxed with the
entrails of the woman washing it.

584
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:20,766
I'd say the town's already panicked.

585
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:22,944
Henry, prepare a press release for me.

586
00:44:22,945 --> 00:44:25,867
It should read, "Public
safety is my primary concern".

587
00:44:25,868 --> 00:44:28,273
Everything that can
be done is being done".

588
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:31,525
Release the video. No comment
speculating on what we think it is.

589
00:44:31,526 --> 00:44:33,377
- Let them see it for themselves.
- Yes, Sir.

590
00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:35,104
And get Ava Reid on the phone.

591
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:36,958
Tell her to bring
Cameron here right now,

592
00:44:36,959 --> 00:44:38,796
or this is gonna be the
worst day of her life.

593
00:44:38,797 --> 00:44:40,704
- Sheriff Martin, line one.
- The worst.

594
00:44:40,705 --> 00:44:43,012
- Today can get worse?
- Yes.

595
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,413
Hello. Martin here.

596
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:46,874
Hello? Hello?

597
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:50,519
- She needs help.
- Oh ah, no!

598
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,703
She needs to see a paramedic!

599
00:44:52,704 --> 00:44:54,991
- I'm fine.
- You see? She's fine.

600
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,509
- No, she's not.
- Ow.

601
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:00,463
- Don't be a baby.
- Seriously, it looks way worse than it is.

602
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:06,044
Oh, yeah? Well get up and
let's see you try and walk.

603
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:18,847
See? I'm fine.

604
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:20,649
Hey, look at this.

605
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:25,150
It's a news article from nine years ago.

606
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:29,175
Finch might not be as
crazy as we thought he was.

607
00:45:29,176 --> 00:45:32,128
So that's Alison. That's Finch's wife.

608
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:37,351
It says she drowned in a cave near the
lighthouse when the high tide came in.

609
00:45:37,352 --> 00:45:39,352
I remember that.

610
00:45:39,353 --> 00:45:42,613
Lot of people thought
that he killed her.

611
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,573
So that must be the cave
that he's talking about.

612
00:45:44,574 --> 00:45:46,543
Guess so.

613
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:49,073
Where did we find my Dads boat?

614
00:45:49,074 --> 00:45:52,096
And where did that thing first show up?

615
00:45:52,097 --> 00:45:54,214
Practically on Finch's doorstep.

616
00:45:54,215 --> 00:45:57,677
We saw Finch yesterday
leaving the Maritime Museum.

617
00:45:57,678 --> 00:46:00,466
They have all kinds of stuff
about that lighthouse there.

618
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,513
Stuff that's not online.

619
00:46:02,514 --> 00:46:04,870
- It's better than nothing.
- I got it!

620
00:46:04,871 --> 00:46:07,329
- What?
- It appears in water.

621
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,498
Any water, right?

622
00:46:09,499 --> 00:46:13,882
So maybe it can't manifest itself
unless there's water around.

623
00:46:13,883 --> 00:46:19,609
Maybe all we gotta do is stay
dry and it'll leave us alone.

624
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,490
Oh, no. Please no.

625
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:30,018
Come on. We gotta go. Come on.

626
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:31,601
Wait up.

627
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:33,601
Wait up. I'm coming with you.

628
00:46:33,602 --> 00:46:36,543
No. No, no, no. I need you to stay here.

629
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:37,820
Seriously?

630
00:46:37,821 --> 00:46:39,454
Just do this for us. Please.

631
00:46:39,455 --> 00:46:41,564
Come on.

632
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:42,980
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

633
00:46:42,981 --> 00:46:47,069
All right, good, good. Wait till we're
gone and then answer the door, okay?

634
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,190
And we were not here.

635
00:46:51,853 --> 00:46:54,853
Sheriff's Department.

636
00:46:56,213 --> 00:46:58,931
Sheriff's Department. Open up.

637
00:46:58,932 --> 00:47:01,650
Come on. Nice and easy.

638
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:03,107
Ugh.

639
00:47:03,108 --> 00:47:05,808
Go. Go. Go. Go.

640
00:47:07,557 --> 00:47:09,837
Let's go.

641
00:47:09,871 --> 00:47:12,571
Go, go. Go. Go.

642
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:27,434
Stop the vehicle.

643
00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:30,529
Turn off the engine.

644
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:32,425
Back so soon?

645
00:47:32,426 --> 00:47:34,150
Told you they're not here.

646
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:37,285
You're welcome to take another look
around if you want. Door's unlocked.

647
00:47:37,286 --> 00:47:39,121
Aren't you a little young to be driving?

648
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:42,639
Not according to the D.M.V.

649
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,640
You wait right here.

650
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:21,497
It's all connected.

651
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,753
It's all connected. It's the cave.

652
00:48:23,754 --> 00:48:27,534
It's the cave. It's the cave!

653
00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:29,536
It brings things back.

654
00:48:29,537 --> 00:48:33,197
You have to help us stop it.

655
00:48:35,262 --> 00:48:37,362
My God.

656
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,863
They're going after it.

657
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:45,335
I say we make a run for it.

658
00:48:45,336 --> 00:48:47,733
I got the keys to my Dad's
cabin in Ridgeway right here.

659
00:48:47,734 --> 00:48:49,191
You guys ever been to Ridgeway?

660
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:52,496
Running away isn't gonna do anything
except get more people killed.

661
00:48:52,497 --> 00:48:53,718
We have to destroy it.

662
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:59,619
How no one's going to listen to us?
We're running out of options here.

663
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,473
What the hell was that?

664
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,275
Building demolitions.

665
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,278
Part of my Dad's new
Smallport initiative.

666
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,281
Oh, yeah? How's that going?

667
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,622
Just drive.

668
00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:35,085
Thought you quit.

669
00:49:35,086 --> 00:49:39,646
I did. You guys go ahead. I'll catch up.

670
00:49:58,762 --> 00:50:02,962
I'm gonna look over here, all right?

671
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,149
Ava. Come look at this.

672
00:50:26,267 --> 00:50:29,725
Wow. Listen to this.
Look at what it says here.

673
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:34,296
"Built in 1897 after hundreds of
ships crashed in it's shallow reef".

674
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:37,984
Huh. I guess that's why they
call it Dead Man's Point.

675
00:50:37,985 --> 00:50:40,326
You guessed wrong.

676
00:50:40,327 --> 00:50:44,440
Hi. Do you know anything about
the cave by the lighthouse?

677
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:46,519
Ah, you think what's going
on in town has something

678
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,123
to do with the old
legends and ghost stories?

679
00:50:49,124 --> 00:50:50,772
More or less.

680
00:50:50,773 --> 00:50:53,816
Have either of you heard of the
legend of the lost Roanoke colony?

681
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:56,810
Yeah, those colonists in the Carolinas.

682
00:50:56,811 --> 00:51:00,512
Who all just vanished without a
trace a couple hundred years ago.

683
00:51:00,513 --> 00:51:02,324
Very good.

684
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:06,285
What if I told you that a
similar thing happened right here?

685
00:51:06,286 --> 00:51:09,534
I would ask you why I
never heard of it before.

686
00:51:09,535 --> 00:51:15,248
Because the town elders did
their best to keep it a secret.

687
00:51:15,249 --> 00:51:21,149
Before 1803, Smallport was the
Spanish province of Ensenada Cabo.

688
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,492
Now...

689
00:51:24,854 --> 00:51:27,314
This diary...

690
00:51:27,419 --> 00:51:30,515
Happens to be the most
detailed documentation,

691
00:51:30,516 --> 00:51:33,161
of the history in this area at the time.

692
00:51:33,162 --> 00:51:35,162
And just like Roanoke...

693
00:51:35,163 --> 00:51:37,605
The entire population vanished.

694
00:51:37,606 --> 00:51:40,186
Into thin air.

695
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,167
Maria, who wrote this...

696
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:47,302
Was convinced that spiritual
forces were responsible.

697
00:51:47,303 --> 00:51:49,992
Wait. What do you mean "spiritual"?

698
00:51:49,993 --> 00:51:52,191
Supernatural.

699
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,622
Ghosts.

700
00:51:53,623 --> 00:51:55,213
Do you believe it?

701
00:51:55,214 --> 00:51:58,046
No. No, it was more likely
a plague of some kind.

702
00:51:58,047 --> 00:52:01,983
And Maria herself was most likely
infected by the disease too.

703
00:52:01,984 --> 00:52:07,289
I'm betting that the stories in here
were just fevered hallucinations.

704
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,327
So where does the cave come in?

705
00:52:10,328 --> 00:52:15,148
Ah, Maria's journal begins after
some of the infected were rounded up,

706
00:52:15,149 --> 00:52:17,633
brought to the cave, and executed.

707
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:21,366
Maria writes that
soon after the murders,

708
00:52:21,367 --> 00:52:25,498
the angry dead Rose up
and ravaged the town.

709
00:52:25,499 --> 00:52:30,384
The journal cuts off in the
middle of the last entry.

710
00:52:30,385 --> 00:52:35,965
"Anyone who dies in the cave
violently will rise again".

711
00:52:38,028 --> 00:52:39,921
Careful.

712
00:52:39,922 --> 00:52:43,592
What I'm about to show you is
the companion piece to the Memoir.

713
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:47,844
A Grimoire, which is a book of
spells that gives very detailed

714
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:53,305
instructions on how to send
vengeful spirits into hell.

715
00:52:59,353 --> 00:53:01,693
It's gone.

716
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:03,239
What was supposed to be here?

717
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,780
The Grimoire, the book that
was in this display case.

718
00:53:06,781 --> 00:53:08,775
He was acting even
stranger than usual but I

719
00:53:08,776 --> 00:53:10,661
never thought he would
do something like this.

720
00:53:10,662 --> 00:53:13,538
- Who was it?
- The lighthouse keeper. Darnell Finch.

721
00:53:13,539 --> 00:53:15,624
He was the only other
person who was in here today.

722
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,605
Finch.

723
00:53:56,474 --> 00:53:58,934
The exhibits.

724
00:54:08,459 --> 00:54:09,464
The floor.

725
00:54:09,465 --> 00:54:12,233
Help me with this tarp.

726
00:54:12,234 --> 00:54:13,549
What happened?

727
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,884
Hey, Cameron.

728
00:54:15,885 --> 00:54:17,943
- What did you do, man?
- I didn't do anything!

729
00:54:17,944 --> 00:54:19,655
It wasn't my fault!

730
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,768
Knock it off!

731
00:54:21,769 --> 00:54:24,331
- I should punch you in the face right now.
- Leave it. Leave it.

732
00:54:24,332 --> 00:54:27,512
Then do it, tough guy.

733
00:54:30,283 --> 00:54:33,343
You guys, behind you!

734
00:54:37,506 --> 00:54:39,720
Whoa. Aah!

735
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:43,921
- Not the lighthouse.
- Don't do it!

736
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:02,323
Cameron, run!

737
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,645
Come on, man! Come on!

738
00:55:12,031 --> 00:55:14,191
Come on!

739
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,091
Cam! Cam, get up!

740
00:55:17,092 --> 00:55:19,413
- Come on!
- Get up!

741
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:21,246
Oh, my God. He's coming, man!

742
00:55:21,247 --> 00:55:23,107
Aah!

743
00:55:24,003 --> 00:55:26,823
- Cam!
- Come on!

744
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:33,580
The city's in a mass panic. That's
fine. I totally understand all that.

745
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:36,109
But election is coming up.

746
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:37,715
Okay, Sheriff?

747
00:55:37,716 --> 00:55:40,275
If I loose my job,
you loose your job too.

748
00:55:40,276 --> 00:55:45,256
- That's what you're worried about?
- Yes. Yes.

749
00:56:21,771 --> 00:56:23,751
Henry?

750
00:56:26,054 --> 00:56:27,898
Aah!

751
00:56:27,899 --> 00:56:29,744
Aah!

752
00:56:29,745 --> 00:56:31,605
Aah!

753
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,498
911. What's your emergency?

754
00:56:52,499 --> 00:56:55,195
Hi. Um, we have two people dead
here at the Maritime Museum.

755
00:56:55,196 --> 00:56:56,900
- The Maritime Museum?
- Yes.

756
00:56:56,901 --> 00:56:59,035
Stay put. We're sending an
officer to your location.

757
00:56:59,036 --> 00:57:03,656
Tell them to turn off the
sprinklers before they go in.

758
00:57:03,657 --> 00:57:07,317
You've got to be kidding me.

759
00:57:08,788 --> 00:57:10,667
What are you doing? You can't drive.

760
00:57:10,668 --> 00:57:12,599
I can drive. I just
don't have my license yet.

761
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,523
You need to go home.

762
00:57:14,524 --> 00:57:15,727
Where's Cameron?

763
00:57:15,728 --> 00:57:17,129
It's none of your business.

764
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:19,654
Now just please... just
get your ass back home.

765
00:57:19,655 --> 00:57:21,122
Why? It's not any safer there?

766
00:57:21,123 --> 00:57:23,000
It's a lot safer there
than where we're going.

767
00:57:23,001 --> 00:57:25,403
Let me help.

768
00:57:25,404 --> 00:57:30,804
You can help me by laying
low and staying dry, okay?

769
00:57:32,347 --> 00:57:33,684
Will you take her home, please?

770
00:57:33,685 --> 00:57:36,304
Yeah. Where you going?

771
00:57:36,305 --> 00:57:40,751
We're about to ride into a hell storm,
and I don't want her riding shotgun.

772
00:57:40,752 --> 00:57:44,052
What happened to Cameron?

773
00:57:48,926 --> 00:57:50,274
Meet me at the lighthouse, okay?

774
00:57:50,275 --> 00:57:51,825
Are you sure it's a good idea?

775
00:57:51,826 --> 00:57:56,109
No, but Finch has the book, and I
think it's time for an intervention.

776
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,030
Okay.

777
00:58:03,584 --> 00:58:05,327
Oh, dear God.

778
00:58:05,328 --> 00:58:07,848
Are you sure?

779
00:58:07,919 --> 00:58:09,719
No.

780
00:58:09,726 --> 00:58:12,846
Right. I'll tell him.

781
00:58:18,317 --> 00:58:20,498
Cameron Stahl. Leave a message.

782
00:58:20,499 --> 00:58:22,479
Frank?

783
00:58:24,904 --> 00:58:27,192
- We found Cameron.
- Well, it's about damn time.

784
00:58:27,193 --> 00:58:30,823
No, Frank. We've got two people
dead at the Maritime Museum.

785
00:58:30,824 --> 00:58:32,712
Cameron's one of 'em.

786
00:58:32,713 --> 00:58:35,053
I'm sorry.

787
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:40,386
Is that charter boat
still down at the docks?

788
00:58:40,387 --> 00:58:43,489
Ray's boat? Yeah, I think so. Why?

789
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:46,674
Get your gear. We're going fishing.

790
00:58:46,675 --> 00:58:47,860
Frank!

791
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:52,665
Arlene, try and hold off
Armageddon till I get back.

792
00:58:52,666 --> 00:58:54,635
Officer, we're not getting any answers.

793
00:58:54,636 --> 00:58:56,369
The Mayor's not talking to anybody...

794
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:57,636
- The Mayor!
- Frank!

795
00:58:57,637 --> 00:58:59,974
Frank, hold on a
second. Hold on a second!

796
00:58:59,975 --> 00:59:03,162
Frank! You are not thinking straight.

797
00:59:03,163 --> 00:59:06,549
No, I get it now. It's the curse.

798
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:09,515
I'm gonna hunt that son of a
bitch down on it's own turf.

799
00:59:09,516 --> 00:59:11,624
- Me and you, Sheriff.
- This is crazy.

800
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:13,591
You'll get your revenge,
Frank, but right now...

801
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:18,052
Revenge? You think I'm
worried about revenge?

802
00:59:18,053 --> 00:59:21,026
I don't want revenge.

803
00:59:21,027 --> 00:59:23,667
I want justice.

804
00:59:34,842 --> 00:59:36,822
Finch!

805
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:40,271
Finch! Finch!

806
00:59:40,906 --> 00:59:42,798
I know you have it!

807
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:45,559
We need to talk!

808
01:00:19,052 --> 01:00:22,154
Ah, you gotta be kidding me.

809
01:00:22,155 --> 01:00:24,323
Guess the Fire Department
didn't get the memo.

810
01:00:24,324 --> 01:00:27,804
Hey! Get out of the water!

811
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,294
Move!

812
01:00:32,265 --> 01:00:34,054
They don't look very nice.

813
01:00:34,055 --> 01:00:37,196
I got this. Kids listen to me.
You're in a lot of danger, all right?

814
01:00:37,197 --> 01:00:39,820
- You gotta get out of the water now.
- What's your problem, punk?

815
01:00:39,821 --> 01:00:43,079
I'm trying to help you, all
right? There's a shark and...

816
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,613
I know it sounds crazy,
all right? You gotta go!

817
01:00:45,614 --> 01:00:48,129
I want some of what y'all smoking.

818
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:51,149
Listen to me, kid, you gotta get
your friends and you gotta leave, now!

819
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:54,210
Y'all need to leave.

820
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,622
Okay.

821
01:01:13,928 --> 01:01:15,788
Ugh.

822
01:01:19,479 --> 01:01:22,059
You all right?

823
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:26,928
Come here. Come here. Come on.

824
01:01:29,422 --> 01:01:34,582
- We got a little problem.
- We got a bigger one.

825
01:01:59,419 --> 01:02:01,579
Come on.

826
01:02:10,515 --> 01:02:13,080
I wanna see this damn thing for myself.

827
01:02:13,081 --> 01:02:16,635
Me too. But I don't know what
we're expecting to find out here.

828
01:02:16,636 --> 01:02:19,931
Well, it started here, so
we're gonna finish it here.

829
01:02:19,932 --> 01:02:21,936
What if it doesn't show?

830
01:02:21,937 --> 01:02:24,757
Just keep looking.

831
01:02:43,412 --> 01:02:45,572
Damn it.

832
01:02:55,519 --> 01:03:00,316
I knew you'd come. You
got a real stubborn streak.

833
01:03:00,317 --> 01:03:01,488
You found it.

834
01:03:01,489 --> 01:03:05,629
Mm, the solid portion of him anyway.

835
01:03:08,888 --> 01:03:10,485
Hey, that's the book from the museum.

836
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:11,901
Hey! What's it to you?

837
01:03:11,902 --> 01:03:14,640
I need it. To stop the shark.

838
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:16,867
Well, why do you think I stole it?

839
01:03:16,868 --> 01:03:18,469
I wasn't sure.

840
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:23,302
To find a way to kill the
shark without hurting Alison.

841
01:03:23,303 --> 01:03:25,354
Your wife's dead.

842
01:03:25,355 --> 01:03:27,335
Wrong.

843
01:03:30,941 --> 01:03:32,712
Well, then where is she?

844
01:03:32,713 --> 01:03:34,210
Why is she here?

845
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:36,371
Shut up.

846
01:03:38,177 --> 01:03:39,977
No.

847
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:56,622
That means, uh...

848
01:03:56,623 --> 01:04:02,245
That means, "a spirit can be sent back
to the netherworld by using a talisman".

849
01:04:02,246 --> 01:04:06,386
Made from the object that killed it.

850
01:04:11,266 --> 01:04:13,126
Hmm!

851
01:04:14,875 --> 01:04:18,123
So we have to use this?

852
01:04:18,124 --> 01:04:22,204
Better hope that was the kill shot.

853
01:04:30,669 --> 01:04:32,186
Nuh-uh.

854
01:04:32,187 --> 01:04:35,524
Your daddy brought this
horror into our world.

855
01:04:35,525 --> 01:04:38,885
You get to send it back.

856
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:45,797
Seen anything yet?

857
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:48,353
He knows we're coming.

858
01:04:48,354 --> 01:04:49,554
Huh?

859
01:04:49,555 --> 01:04:52,086
I said he's scared. He
knows we got his number.

860
01:04:52,087 --> 01:04:53,314
The number of the beast.

861
01:04:53,315 --> 01:04:56,795
- Frank, that doesn't even make sense.
- Shut up and start chumming.

862
01:04:56,796 --> 01:04:59,992
I knew I shouldn't have come out here
with you. You've lost your damn mind!

863
01:04:59,993 --> 01:05:01,226
I said start chumming.

864
01:05:01,227 --> 01:05:04,702
We don't need to chum, we are the chum.

865
01:05:04,703 --> 01:05:07,601
All we need is a will to live
and that thing is coming after us.

866
01:05:07,602 --> 01:05:12,144
That's the point. In order to kill
it, you gotta be willing to die.

867
01:05:12,145 --> 01:05:13,195
It's over, Frank.

868
01:05:13,196 --> 01:05:16,748
I'm turning this boat around right now.

869
01:05:16,749 --> 01:05:18,850
You wanna run that by me again?

870
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:24,011
Get back to chumming
before I blow off your head.

871
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:59,291
Gary!

872
01:06:56,649 --> 01:06:58,509
Aah!

873
01:07:14,033 --> 01:07:15,705
Hey, pee-wee!

874
01:07:15,706 --> 01:07:17,876
Maybe you ought to call it.

875
01:07:17,877 --> 01:07:20,171
What, like hey fishy, fishy?

876
01:07:20,172 --> 01:07:22,512
Oh, please.

877
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:24,672
Just give me the damn thing.

878
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:28,453
Like this, here check this out.

879
01:07:32,785 --> 01:07:35,051
Whoa. Easy, psycho.

880
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,252
Why did you bring her here?

881
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:38,447
We didn't have a choice, all right,
what the hell are you doing in the water?

882
01:07:38,448 --> 01:07:40,197
We know how to kill it.

883
01:07:40,198 --> 01:07:42,026
How?

884
01:07:42,027 --> 01:07:43,465
With this, buddy.

885
01:07:43,466 --> 01:07:45,863
You're going to stab a ghost to death?

886
01:07:45,864 --> 01:07:49,038
Yeah. Something like that.

887
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,436
Whoa! There it is! There it is.

888
01:07:51,437 --> 01:07:52,814
Get out there.

889
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:55,037
Ava! Ava, get out of the water!

890
01:07:55,038 --> 01:07:56,908
No, no, you stray
right there, sweetheart.

891
01:07:56,909 --> 01:07:59,397
- What are you doing?
- You're doing just fine.

892
01:07:59,398 --> 01:08:01,258
Ava!

893
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:05,970
Ava! What are you...
get out of the water!

894
01:08:25,465 --> 01:08:27,957
- Whoa!
- It worked!

895
01:08:27,958 --> 01:08:30,058
Amazing!

896
01:08:44,089 --> 01:08:45,949
Aah!

897
01:08:55,778 --> 01:08:57,313
You all right?

898
01:08:57,314 --> 01:08:59,821
Come on, sis. How do you feel?

899
01:08:59,822 --> 01:09:02,791
So it's not as easy as I thought.
Must have missed something.

900
01:09:02,792 --> 01:09:04,441
Maybe we're looking
at this the wrong way.

901
01:09:04,442 --> 01:09:05,999
- What do you mean?
- The settlers.

902
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,141
The ones that died in the 18th century.

903
01:09:08,142 --> 01:09:10,292
All of that bad energy
is still in the cave.

904
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:12,143
Maybe it's the cave we need to blow up.

905
01:09:12,144 --> 01:09:14,285
That's gonna take some
serious ammunition.

906
01:09:14,286 --> 01:09:16,303
You don't know what
you're talking about.

907
01:09:16,304 --> 01:09:19,424
Don't talk like that.

908
01:09:21,191 --> 01:09:23,417
We passed a construction
site on the way over here.

909
01:09:23,418 --> 01:09:25,489
They were blasting. They have dynamite.

910
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:29,330
No! Nobody's blowing up nothing!

911
01:09:29,497 --> 01:09:31,897
Forget that.

912
01:09:32,581 --> 01:09:35,101
Look, Finch...

913
01:09:35,795 --> 01:09:40,526
I'm really sorry about your wife,
but she's been dead for a long time.

914
01:09:40,527 --> 01:09:42,981
We need to save the people in
this town that are still alive.

915
01:09:42,982 --> 01:09:44,524
She's still alive, damn it.

916
01:09:44,525 --> 01:09:46,070
In this world.

917
01:09:46,071 --> 01:09:47,662
Hey! Give me that.

918
01:09:47,663 --> 01:09:49,212
Hey.

919
01:09:49,213 --> 01:09:51,983
- Stay where you are.
- I can't lose her again!

920
01:09:51,984 --> 01:09:57,363
Don't you understand that!
I won't do it! I can't do it!

921
01:09:57,364 --> 01:10:00,034
It wasn't your fault. She drowned.

922
01:10:00,035 --> 01:10:02,555
I killed her!

923
01:10:02,811 --> 01:10:06,351
I killed her. I killed her.

924
01:10:08,351 --> 01:10:11,145
She was always looking
for a little treasure.

925
01:10:11,146 --> 01:10:13,653
She thought they were treasures.

926
01:10:13,654 --> 01:10:16,523
Whenever there was a high tide,
the trinkets and the objects

927
01:10:16,524 --> 01:10:20,075
from the sunken ships would show up.

928
01:10:20,076 --> 01:10:23,616
Drift into that little cave.

929
01:10:24,985 --> 01:10:27,325
Like those.

930
01:10:29,973 --> 01:10:32,669
We gonna be out here all day?
Come on. I'm sick of this...

931
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:35,587
I loved my wife, but
we fought all the time.

932
01:10:35,588 --> 01:10:38,377
Especially if we were both drinking.

933
01:10:38,378 --> 01:10:42,150
Things could get ugly
between the two of us.

934
01:10:42,151 --> 01:10:48,051
And Alison, she would tend to
get violent when I made her mad.

935
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:57,285
I lost control.

936
01:10:57,286 --> 01:11:03,106
By the time I realized what
I was doing, it was too late.

937
01:11:04,807 --> 01:11:08,435
I ran back to the lighthouse.

938
01:11:08,436 --> 01:11:13,577
Told the Sheriff Alison was in the
cave when the high tide rolled in.

939
01:11:13,578 --> 01:11:17,963
They ruled it a drowning, but
they always suspected I'd done it.

940
01:11:17,964 --> 01:11:22,644
Worse, I had to live
knowing I'd done it.

941
01:11:23,327 --> 01:11:28,907
Only solace I've had is
knowing she must have forgiven.

942
01:11:28,998 --> 01:11:33,545
She must have known she
wasn't in my right mind.

943
01:11:33,546 --> 01:11:37,415
Or else she could have come
back for revenge like...

944
01:11:37,416 --> 01:11:40,696
Like those settlers, like that shark.

945
01:11:40,697 --> 01:11:43,745
You're worried about Alison's
spirit if we blow up the cave?

946
01:11:43,746 --> 01:11:47,081
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

947
01:11:47,082 --> 01:11:48,670
Check it out.

948
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:51,011
Look. Look.

949
01:11:51,649 --> 01:11:55,157
I'm not gonna lose her again.

950
01:11:55,158 --> 01:11:59,160
Look, Finch, I understand your pain.

951
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:04,141
I do. But I'm not gonna let innocent people
die just to soothe your guilty conscience.

952
01:12:04,142 --> 01:12:09,788
So you can help me or not, but I'm
gonna do this with or without you.

953
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:14,075
I cannot let you do that.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

954
01:12:14,076 --> 01:12:15,577
Give me that book!

955
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:19,995
- You're making a mistake.
- Give me that book, kid.

956
01:12:19,996 --> 01:12:21,950
There's gotta be another way.

957
01:12:21,951 --> 01:12:23,904
And I'm gonna... I'm gonna find it.

958
01:12:23,905 --> 01:12:26,365
We can help.

959
01:12:33,656 --> 01:12:35,516
Hey!

960
01:12:43,049 --> 01:12:45,389
Step aside.

961
01:13:08,664 --> 01:13:10,468
Where'd you learn how to pick a lock?

962
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:12,569
Youtube.

963
01:13:13,362 --> 01:13:15,942
Almost got it.

964
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,820
Voila.

965
01:13:33,656 --> 01:13:34,949
- You want me to drive?
- No.

966
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:38,010
- Can I drive?
- No.

967
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,540
Hello?

968
01:13:56,841 --> 01:13:58,941
Sheriff?

969
01:14:01,382 --> 01:14:04,142
Anybody on board?

970
01:14:15,998 --> 01:14:18,698
Son of a bitch.

971
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:22,220
Yuck.

972
01:14:24,810 --> 01:14:26,706
- This is it.
- It's locked.

973
01:14:26,707 --> 01:14:29,338
I mean, we could probably jump
it, but that's barbed wire.

974
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:30,420
Can you get us in?

975
01:14:30,421 --> 01:14:33,080
No way. That trick
doesn't work on padlocks.

976
01:14:33,081 --> 01:14:35,602
Then we have to ram it.

977
01:14:35,603 --> 01:14:39,741
Destruction of property, theft
of highly-explosive material.

978
01:14:39,742 --> 01:14:42,682
Breaking, entering...

979
01:14:42,958 --> 01:14:45,026
Tell that to the Judge
if he's still alive.

980
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:47,247
Punch it.

981
01:14:58,006 --> 01:15:00,166
My turn.

982
01:15:07,315 --> 01:15:08,937
Get in.

983
01:15:08,938 --> 01:15:11,218
All right.

984
01:15:12,952 --> 01:15:15,532
That was cool.

985
01:15:52,361 --> 01:15:54,701
Let's see.

986
01:16:28,364 --> 01:16:30,584
The cave.

987
01:16:41,615 --> 01:16:46,175
- Watch out for snakes, all right?
- Okay.

988
01:16:54,156 --> 01:16:56,316
Come on.

989
01:17:08,775 --> 01:17:10,923
We have to do this.

990
01:17:10,924 --> 01:17:12,406
I know you do.

991
01:17:12,407 --> 01:17:15,887
And I'm here to help you.

992
01:17:16,505 --> 01:17:19,505
Let's get 'er done!

993
01:17:20,127 --> 01:17:21,544
Go.

994
01:17:21,545 --> 01:17:23,765
Last one.

995
01:17:34,631 --> 01:17:37,271
Okay. All good.

996
01:17:42,538 --> 01:17:44,458
Okay.

997
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,849
- Okay.
- Is one fuse enough?

998
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:51,750
Yeah, it'll chain-reaction. This
whole place is toast. Lighter?

999
01:18:09,568 --> 01:18:10,411
Stay here!

1000
01:18:10,412 --> 01:18:13,412
Where are you going?

1001
01:18:21,243 --> 01:18:23,883
God forgive me.

1002
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:46,263
- Look, just hurry up!
- The lighter's wet.

1003
01:18:48,643 --> 01:18:50,683
Blaise!

1004
01:18:51,447 --> 01:18:53,861
- I'm okay.
- Get the hell out of here!

1005
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:56,622
In front of you!

1006
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,820
Hey! Hey!

1007
01:19:11,467 --> 01:19:13,507
Blaise!

1008
01:19:14,538 --> 01:19:16,758
Oh, damn.

1009
01:20:30,259 --> 01:20:33,139
Bit me, you bitch.

1010
01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:13,990
Hey!

1011
01:21:22,292 --> 01:21:23,974
Ava.

1012
01:21:23,975 --> 01:21:26,735
It's gonna blow!

1013
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,074
No! Ava!

1014
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:24,290
Ah!

1015
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:38,017
No! No!

1016
01:22:38,805 --> 01:22:40,605
No.

1017
01:22:41,876 --> 01:22:44,636
She's gonna die.

1018
01:22:44,775 --> 01:22:47,175
She's dead.

1019
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:54,333
She's gone.

1020
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,619
Hey!

1021
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:10,480
Hey!

1022
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:15,197
Oh, my God.

1023
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:17,598
Oh, my God.

1024
01:23:25,168 --> 01:23:28,361
Hey, you all right? What
happened to your hand?

1025
01:23:28,362 --> 01:23:31,002
It'll be okay.

1026
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,477
Hey, what happened to "I don't swim"?

1027
01:23:33,478 --> 01:23:35,846
I said, "I don't swim,"
not "I can't swim".

1028
01:23:35,847 --> 01:23:38,727
Who's winning now?

1029
01:23:39,335 --> 01:23:44,795
Sucks about Mick and, uh,
Taylor, and your Dad, and...

1030
01:23:44,813 --> 01:23:47,213
Oh, Cameron.

1031
01:23:48,543 --> 01:23:50,725
What day is it today?

1032
01:23:50,726 --> 01:23:52,826
Tuesday?

1033
