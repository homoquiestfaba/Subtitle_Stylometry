1
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,668
Claire.

2
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:44,836
Claire.

3
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,507
Claire, Claire wake up.

4
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,925
Wake up, wake up, Claire.

5
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:50,759
Claire, wake up.

6
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,012
Baby.

7
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,102
Baby.

8
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,237
Baby.

9
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,358
Baby.

10
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,279
Please, ah.

11
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:13,800
Who's baby?

12
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,511
I don't know.

13
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:28,315
Baby, baby

14
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,570
Huh.

15
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,366
Well, I'm not gonna get any
sleep tonight.

16
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,535
Yeah, no, I'm
sleeping with all the lights on.

17
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,537
Why do we do this to
ourselves?

18
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,372
It's fun.

19
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,252
Oh shit, we're so late.

20
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,214
I feel like I lost my voice

21
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:53,465
from screaming so much.

22
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,153
Okay, back to the real world.

23
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,928
Why do we still work
here?

24
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,721
Oh, because
it's a fabulous salary.

25
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,348
Uh, I can't wait to leave.

26
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,813
Do you think your boyfriend
will be here tonight?

27
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,357
He's not my boyfriend.

28
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,191
Really?

29
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,360
Because you stare at him
like you want him to be.

30
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,903
He's pretty cute.

31
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,282
Oh Hero, oh my Hero.

32
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,161
I'm sorry.

33
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,704
So what time tomorrow?

34
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,916
Six, if we're gonna
find a place to park.

35
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,959
Drinks first?

36
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,918
Make it five, then?

37
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:12,711
Beautiful.

38
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,464
Bye, slut.

39
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,798
Love you, Maggie.

40
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,799
I love you too.

41
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,459
Hey Taryn.

42
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,085
Sweetie, can I get a
cup of coffee over here?

43
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,170
Yeah, I'll be right there, Neely.

44
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,004
Taryn.

45
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,547
I know.

46
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,590
You're 10 minutes late.

47
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,675
I know, I'm sorry, man.

48
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,636
I got a restaurant full of
people here.

49
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,929
I got it, Rodney.

50
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,808
How's the search going?

51
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,562
Actually, I think I've
narrowed it down.

52
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,855
Really?

53
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,440
Do you know that old
drive-in movie theater

54
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,441
at the edge of town?

55
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,400
The Starlight?

56
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,777
I just came from there.

57
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:19,903
And?

58
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,447
And I've always thought
that place was pretty special.

59
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,323
Been going there since I was a kid.

60
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,244
Hey, I could use
some more coffee over here.

61
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,078
I'll be back.

62
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,417
How's your chicken parm tonight?

63
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,670
It's the same as it always is.

64
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,755
Charlene still taking
care of her mom in Lagrange?

65
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,174
Yeah, and her sister still has
the kids.

66
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,268
Who's the drifter?

67
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,102
Drifter?

68
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,771
Oh, wrong guess.

69
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,856
That's Hero, he's an archeologist.

70
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,109
He has all kinds of college degrees.

71
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,318
Hero?

72
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,695
It's just a nickname.

73
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:05,865
His real name's a jaw
buster, it's Her, Hieronymus?

74
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,909
He's kind of shy, but
once you get to know him,

75
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,578
he opens up.

76
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,288
Has he been coming in regular?

77
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,289
About three weeks.

78
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,666
So what's he here for?

79
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,127
Guess he's trying to find some stuff.

80
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,758
He's looking for this
ancient civilization.

81
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,052
14,000 years old.

82
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,555
And he thinks he's found it,
right here in Carverstown.

83
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,599
He's gonna put this place on the map.

84
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,518
He sounds like just another
nut case hitting on you.

85
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:36,938
What time are you getting off?

86
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:37,772
Same old time.

87
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,401
Same old time, why?

88
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,069
So I can pick you up.

89
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,947
I might have other plans.

90
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,325
Oh, you fixin' to be mean to me.

91
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,118
Your wife's my second cousin.

92
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,870
That's never bothered you before.

93
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,711
Well maybe I've done
some growing up since then.

94
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,463
Why don't you tell me
all about it at midnight.

95
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,797
Order up.

96
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,174
Eat your chicken.

97
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,017
Everything okay?

98
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:14,851
Sure.

99
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,688
Is that where you think it is?

100
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,024
If not, I've wasted
two years of research.

101
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:26,154
But, when I'm there, I feel it.

102
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,447
Feel what?

103
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,408
Emanations from the ruins of a city

104
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,202
buried 14,000 years ago.

105
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,747
But whatever's left is
discharging enough energy

106
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,207
to make my skin crawl.

107
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,293
I mean, I'm naturally
sensitive to the earth's

108
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,047
energy fields, but this
place, it's almost enough

109
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,465
to knock me on my ass.

110
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,427
So what happened to it?

111
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,179
Believe it or not,

112
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,182
earthquakes strong
enough to move mountains.

113
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,685
There's earthquakes in
Georgia?

114
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,562
Well, seismically
this area was very, very

115
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,563
different back then.

116
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,319
So these visions, is
it like being psychic?

117
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,533
Well, neurologically
speaking, I'm epileptic.

118
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:17,706
When I have an occurrence,
a seizure, I see things.

119
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,545
People, events, places,
past, present, future.

120
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,339
It's never the whole thing.

121
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,466
Just quick flashes.

122
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,177
Order up.

123
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,011
Okay.

124
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,558
Here, let me top you off.

125
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:39,811
Ah, ah.

126
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,192
Sorry, I'm sorry.

127
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,027
I'm sorry, Hero.

128
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,655
Somebody help.

129
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,824
Rodney, somebody call 911.

130
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:10,133
Hero, can you hear me?

131
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,051
Hero.

132
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,596
Hero.

133
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,349
So he's already been discharged?

134
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,729
Did he leave an address
or maybe a phone number?

135
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,441
No, this is very important.

136
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,776
I have something he needs.

137
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,404
Okay.

138
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,238
Thanks anyway.

139
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,492
Damn.

140
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,959
No luck.

141
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,462
Well, he'll probably be
back for his glasses, right?

142
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,175
Listen, I wanted to show you something.

143
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,015
I found that on the floor.

144
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,059
He was showing this to me earlier.

145
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:01,851
What is it?

146
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,896
Do you have any tape?

147
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,648
Yeah, I think so.

148
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,077
I bet you good money I
know exactly where he is.

149
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:19,911
Yeah?

150
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,206
I'll just take it to him on my
way home.

151
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,833
Were you planning on stopping
by?

152
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,042
I mean, why bother?

153
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,794
Because I need to know he's
okay.

154
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,210
Hero.

155
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,315
Hero.

156
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,039
Hero?

157
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,462
Hero.

158
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,384
Taryn?

159
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,260
Goddamn it, Hero.

160
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,094
Sorry.

161
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,973
What are you doing here?

162
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,808
I brought you your glasses.

163
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,358
You shouldn't be here.

164
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,485
Hero, look out.

165
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,528
Hero.

166
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,072
Oh my God, Hero.

167
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,073
He's not dead.

168
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,534
I don't want him dead, yet.

169
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,369
Why did you do that?

170
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,244
We didn't do anything.

171
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,330
Liar.

172
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,800
Our Lord did not bleed for you,

173
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,302
so can throw His mercy back in
His face.

174
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,516
Is he your, your newest?

175
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,517
Hero and I never--

176
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,851
You get tired of being defiled

177
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,562
by that son of a whore, Neely
Blasemore?

178
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,022
There were so many.

179
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:58,236
And you took your, your
goodness, your sweetness.

180
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,029
Neely's been done for a while.

181
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,951
No, how many have there been,
huh?

182
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,369
I seen 'em.

183
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,328
I seen 'em all.

184
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,541
You're right, I'm sorry.

185
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,417
I'm sick.

186
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,337
I need help.

187
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,171
God's help.

188
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,799
Please help me, John.

189
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,593
Please, John, please.

190
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,470
Help me.

191
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,017
No, you can't be helped.

192
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,810
Who do you think made me this
way?

193
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:42,030
Go with God, if He'll have you.

194
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,143
Oh my God.

195
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,145
What?

196
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,126
Oh my God.

197
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,546
No, I--

198
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,216
Hey.

199
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,176
Hey, hey.

200
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,764
Hey you.

201
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,817
Thy steadfast love, oh
Lord, extends to the heavens.

202
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:47,238
Thy faithfulness to the clouds.

203
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,992
Thy righteousness is like
the mountains of God.

204
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,619
Thy judgments are like the great deed.

205
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:58,457
Man and beast thou savest oh Lord,

206
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,961
how precious your steadfast love.

207
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,849
Thank you, Brother John,
for that eloquent reading

208
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,517
from one of our favorite Psalms.

209
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,062
Now let us turn to hymn number 79.

210
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,245
So, that's the
last time you saw her?

211
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,705
I just can't believe it.

212
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,512
So Megan, did Taryn
call or text last night.

213
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,807
Um, maybe.

214
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,732
It's just the usual trash
talk gossip, you know?

215
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,528
So she didn't mention having a
late date?

216
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:15,993
Mm-mm, I would've been the first.

217
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,290
We've been friends since fifth grade.

218
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,378
Blood sisters we called ourselves.

219
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,421
We did this stupid blood oath.

220
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:30,967
Still have a scar.

221
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:36,639
Taryn, Taryn, she was
squeamish about being cut.

222
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,767
She was very dear to us, Megan.

223
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,230
Pauline and I loved her as if
she were our own, you know?

224
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,609
She was such a blessing
to Pauline, God rest her.

225
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,196
We couldn't have children of our own.

226
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,325
Taryn's tragic loss for a family

227
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,538
was God's blessing to us, you
know?

228
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,498
I hope she had only good things
to say

229
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,208
about the years she lived with us.

230
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:06,210
She didn't

231
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,714
talk much about personal stuff.

232
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,717
You know how she was.

233
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,927
I'd spend hours trying
to cheer her up and,

234
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,306
Sheriff, can I get back to work
please?

235
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,308
In a moment, Megan.

236
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,226
I'm just trying to establish
Taryn's whereabouts

237
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,020
after she left the diner last night.

238
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,897
Excuse me, John.

239
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,482
We talked to Rodney.

240
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,151
There was something going
down here last night

241
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,153
that might have to do with the case.

242
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,362
Like what?

243
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,197
There's this hippie who
was taking his meals here

244
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,449
for about three weeks.

245
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:37,283
Hero?

246
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,453
You know him?

247
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,996
I've seen him a couple times.

248
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,874
Can you describe him?

249
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,168
Shy, I mean unless you had him
warmed up

250
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,921
about his favorite topic which
is velocities of Atlantis.

251
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,674
I meant, physically.

252
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,259
Oh, hmm.

253
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,679
Tall, thin, lots of hair, glasses.

254
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,391
Fits the description
we have from the witness.

255
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,685
Also he's an epileptic.

256
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,354
Had a seizure here last night.

257
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,481
Medics scooped him up,
but he was out of the ER

258
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,607
in a couple hours.

259
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,275
Did you get a phone
number or an address?

260
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,235
No, but we're getting a
copy of his insurance card.

261
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,362
I might know.

262
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,784
I mean, he talked about
the Allatoona Camp Ground.

263
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:23,245
I guess they rent cabins by the
week and--

264
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,914
Dispatch, who do we have right now

265
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,499
in the vicinity of Allatoona--

266
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,833
Hero couldn't have done this, though.

267
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,293
This guy wouldn't hurt a fly.

268
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,297
Well did, did Taryn have a,

269
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,674
you know, a crush on him.

270
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,844
She didn't say anything to me.

271
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,807
If anything, he brought
out the mother in Taryn.

272
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:46,268
You know how she was, stray
cats and dogs and stuff.

273
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,063
Like that was her biggest flaw.

274
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,694
Thank you, Megan.

275
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,265
Hero, look out.

276
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,684
I don't want him dead, yet.

277
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,531
Clear.

278
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,835
Got his meds, Diazepan.

279
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,256
Good, he'll probably try to
refill that

280
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,966
if we don't catch up to him first.

281
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,594
It looks like we just
missed him.

282
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,931
Yeah, sun's gonna be
down in about an hour.

283
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,476
We need a search team here pronto.

284
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,482
And get Charlie Hodge
up here with his dog.

285
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,399
Yes, sir.

286
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,450
Okay, okay.

287
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,743
Where am I?

288
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:09,453
Okay.

289
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,497
Latitude.

290
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,500
Longitude.

291
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,712
Okay, nearest town, Eddysville.

292
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:24,301
Three and a half clicks north, northeast.

293
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,970
Okay, that's good.

294
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,973
And that is really, really bad.

295
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,395
Okay, okay, think, think, think.

296
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,022
Okay, do I back track down the
creek?

297
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,108
That's not gonna fool those dogs
for long.

298
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,777
You?

299
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:42,653
It's me.

300
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,156
You can't be.

301
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,366
I'll explain later.

302
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,285
Oh my God, but you're--

303
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,119
Stop gawking.

304
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,538
Run like hell, find Jacob's bus.

305
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,455
But how?

306
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,582
That way, half a mile.

307
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:55,916
Find the damn bus.

308
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,251
I'll take care of the dogs.

309
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,837
Sheriff?

310
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,422
Yeah, go ahead.

311
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,632
Them damn dogs are red hot on
his trail.

312
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,176
Can't be long.

313
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,429
Just let the dogs off the leash,

314
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:11,098
they can get to him faster than
you can.

315
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,017
That ain't highly recommended, Sheriff.

316
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,185
These shepherds will tear him to
pieces--

317
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,396
Well not if he has enough
brains to climb a tree.

318
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,815
Come on, boys.

319
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:24,820
Saddle up.

320
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,785
Oh my God, there is a bus.

321
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,499
Stick him, boys, get him.

322
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,334
Come on.

323
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,308
Well, here you is at least.

324
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,603
I begun to have my doubts.

325
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,232
Taryn?

326
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,276
Oh, she'll be along directly,
no worry.

327
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:15,245
Man, that's sho enough the
hounds of hell.

328
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,581
You best get on board now.

329
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,291
Where are we going?

330
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,711
A more commodious place
than you at right now.

331
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,755
You got my guarantee on that.

332
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:37,726
Where is she?

333
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,560
Right here.

334
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,692
Where am I?

335
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,318
No, no, wrong question.

336
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,570
Where are we?

337
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,572
It's all a reality field.

338
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,033
Jacob, did you not tell him
anything?

339
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,327
Reckon I'd leave that to you, missy.

340
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,081
Sure, since I'm the expert.

341
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,666
I did just die a few hours ago.

342
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,835
Taryn, I--

343
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:06,380
Hero, you really should
get a grip on something.

344
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,589
Wait, what?

345
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,383
Jacob's about to haul ass out
of here.

346
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:10,467
Yes, ma'am.

347
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,397
Never changes.

348
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,027
Thanks for the warning.

349
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,363
I told you to grab something.

350
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,624
What is that smell?

351
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,126
That's the scent of violets.

352
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,339
No, don't touch me, I'll
disintegrate.

353
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,133
Different energy fields, it'll
take hours

354
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,051
to pull me back together.

355
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,386
How did you find me?

356
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,764
Astro configuration.

357
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,099
Trust me, it's nothing
that teach at Princeton.

358
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,271
Hero, we've got a problem.

359
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,398
Seems like we both do.

360
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,193
Sheriff John Stone.

361
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,530
Listen, as long as you're still alive

362
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,657
we can do something about him.

363
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,993
Place the blame for my
murder where it belongs.

364
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,706
Otherwise, I am doomed
just like the rest of them.

365
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,209
Who?

366
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,585
Take a look around, Hero.

367
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,769
Where did they come
from?

368
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:47,147
They got on here and there
while you were nodding off.

369
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,398
Nodding off?

370
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,109
It's happened six times
since we've been talking.

371
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,405
There, you just did it
again for a couple seconds.

372
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,450
I mean, in your time frame
and velocity of course.

373
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,290
So, my funeral is in two days.

374
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,504
Once I'm in the ground, I
only have two options left.

375
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:14,007
The better place, it does exist, Hero.

376
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,344
Or I become one of them.

377
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,809
And am restless and
earthbound with nothing

378
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:27,187
but John Stone on my mind
and nothing that I can--

379
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,438
Hero, wake up.

380
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,110
Okay.

381
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,029
So in order to ensure that
you're not stuck here,

382
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,740
we have two days.

383
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:44,413
He's obviously a mad man,
but any specific reason

384
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:46,123
why he targeted you?

385
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,541
Fear.

386
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,835
He was afraid that I
would expose him one day.

387
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,172
And unless we put John Stone in
the hell

388
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,383
that he deserves, I'm going to
be stuck

389
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,676
in the in between forever.

390
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,761
Expose him for what?

391
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,974
Him and his wife took me in
after my parents passed away.

392
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,896
He abused me the first time when
I was 14.

393
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,983
And then he continued doing it

394
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,319
until I was old enough
to get out of the house.

395
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,403
Did his wife know?

396
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,073
If she did, she was too
scared to say anything.

397
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,409
I mean, being married to a
pillar of the community is--

398
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,785
I, I got it.

399
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,582
For now, I have to get going.

400
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,876
You need to have a safe
place to sleep tonight.

401
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,587
Belvedere Cemetery.

402
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:37,007
That's you, Mr. And Mrs. Olgivie.

403
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,050
Nod off, Hero.

404
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:30,560
Hi, Megan.

405
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,398
You okay?

406
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,027
Spider.

407
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,740
We don't have all night.

408
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,742
Get in the car, now.

409
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,248
I think I'm gonna hurl.

410
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,082
Deep breaths.

411
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:57,796
Better?

412
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,262
I can't believe this
is happening right now.

413
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,805
I have a little favor to ask.

414
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,606
Thought you were gonna snooze

415
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,108
through the rest of the night.

416
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,652
You're here, my friend.

417
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,780
Wait, I am?

418
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,073
Where?

419
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,658
Call it your jumping off place.

420
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,651
Get in.

421
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,486
Megan?

422
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:03,320
Get in.

423
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,287
How did you know where to find
me?

424
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,121
Seriously?

425
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,207
You saw her too.

426
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:36,853
It's nice.

427
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,608
My brother's place.

428
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,777
Mine is a horrible one bedroom.

429
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,532
But he's out of town so I
think we'll be safe here.

430
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,751
When was the last time you ate
something?

431
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,503
I don't remember.

432
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,004
Then I will make some eggs,

433
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,549
after I make a drink.

434
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,807
Do you want one?

435
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:15,142
Huh?

436
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,310
Oh, uh I don't drink.

437
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,397
I can't, it's a neurological thing.

438
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,024
Bathroom?

439
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,704
If this is a miracle,
it's one that nobody wants.

440
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:39,249
And honestly, I think she's
taken this blood sister thing

441
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,292
just a little too far.

442
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,169
But that's probably how she
found you?

443
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:43,128
Okay, and where is she now?

444
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,588
Right here.

445
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,006
Jesus Christ.

446
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,716
Nope, still Taryn.

447
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,218
You did it again.

448
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,053
Should you call ahead?

449
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,348
No, considering the circumstances,

450
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,350
I think you're doing just fine.

451
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:01,104
Is that my shirt?

452
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,243
How many of those have
you had?

453
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,038
Enough to knock me on my ass.

454
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,462
It just, I wish you would've
told me about Stone.

455
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:26,838
It was too dangerous.

456
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,883
If you would've just looked
at him the wrong way,

457
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,551
he would've known that I told you.

458
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,554
And why couldn't you have just
left?

459
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:36,640
It takes courage to leave.

460
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,269
Courage, self-respect,
everything that he stole from me.

461
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,772
Now in two days I will be stuck

462
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,399
in this shitty little town forever.

463
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,110
We gotta bring Stone down and fast.

464
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,905
Okay, so how?

465
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,575
He has photos, Megan.

466
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,826
And videos he took of us.

467
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,873
Okay, even if we knew
where to locate these tapes.

468
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,169
He has a locked filing
cabinet in his office at home.

469
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,462
Do you know the combination?

470
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,383
No, but you could get it off
with a hammer and a chisel.

471
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:12,968
In the garage.

472
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,553
My brother has more
tools than Chippendale's.

473
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,306
Okay, that's after we
break into the house.

474
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,808
The Sheriff's house.

475
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,476
He's lived alone since his
wife died.

476
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,020
And the house is empty during
the day.

477
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,981
He's never locked it, not even
at night.

478
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,232
So I just walk in?

479
00:34:28,358 --> 00:34:29,192
That's easy.

480
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:31,319
Except for the fact that my face

481
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,781
is gonna be plastered all over
the news tomorrow morning.

482
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,949
I've got it.

483
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,535
You wear one of my brother's
shirts, his tool belt.

484
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,245
If anybody does see
you, they're gonna think

485
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,621
you're there doing a repair.

486
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:46,584
I drive you up to the front of
the house, you walk right in.

487
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,419
It can't take what, a couple
minutes?

488
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:51,381
Okay, even if we get
the videos, what then?

489
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:52,340
Post them online.

490
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,094
The local news station,
the sheriff's department.

491
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,473
I mean, YouTube, just get them
out there.

492
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,516
Taryn, what do you--

493
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,603
Is she coming back?

494
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,400
What is that scent?

495
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,234
Violets.

496
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,696
I think it's what she leaves behind

497
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:18,283
so that we can remember her, her soul.

498
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:27,959
Hero?

499
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,211
Yeah.

500
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,260
Are you scared?

501
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,095
Is there any other way to be?

502
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,984
What, what if we screw this up
tomorrow?

503
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:58,073
I don't wanna think about that.

504
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,574
Yeah, me either.

505
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,811
What?

506
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,188
You'll do.

507
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:42,075
So what do you think
happened last night?

508
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:44,494
Looks like he knew we were coming.

509
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:47,622
Yeah, somebody's giving
him some help somewhere.

510
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,457
Then there's probably another story.

511
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,460
Take what, two weeks?

512
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,045
It's negative on the
prints from the knife.

513
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,088
Too fragmentary.

514
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,049
So what do you think?

515
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,969
Do we go with person of
interest or prime suspect?

516
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,098
Well, tell me what
we know about the kid.

517
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,767
He's 28, multiple
degrees in ancient history,

518
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,353
archeology, paleontology.

519
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,647
Research grants from
different foundations,

520
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,940
including the Smithsonian.

521
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:18,570
Well that's nice, come on, Lara.

522
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,363
Okay, no beefs.

523
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,993
Not even an overdue parking ticket.

524
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,536
Anybody that we've talked to so far

525
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:27,996
speaks very highly of him.

526
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:32,041
His temperament, diligence,
social life.

527
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,544
Parents are divorced, no siblings,

528
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,505
but here's a recent photo
pulled from the internet.

529
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:44,053
You know, John, for me he
just doesn't fit the profile.

530
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,806
It takes a rare breed of killer
to cut the throat like that

531
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,683
and so far, no motive.

532
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,687
So why's the kid on the run?

533
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:53,772
Terrified, probably.

534
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,985
Yeah well, if he happens to be innocent,

535
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,530
maybe he'll come to his
senses and turn himself in.

536
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,534
Meanwhile, he's probably
armed and I presume dangerous

537
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,077
and that's what we're going with.

538
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,416
That can get him shot.

539
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,503
Yeah well, he's made that
his problem, hasn't he?

540
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,463
There it is.

541
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,674
Yeah, and anybody could be watching

542
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,302
through different directions.

543
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,054
Walk right in through the
front door,

544
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,931
just like we talked about.

545
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,892
Yeah, just walk right in.

546
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,480
I will be right here when you
come out,

547
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,690
studying for my exam.

548
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:20,400
Studying what?

549
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,485
Tax accounting.

550
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,574
I know, it's boring for
someone who has been

551
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,742
on expedition to Outer Mongolia.

552
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:34,747
Yeah, subzero temperatures,
dust storms, hostile locals.

553
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,210
That was a cake walk compared to this.

554
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,044
Hero.

555
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,588
Yeah?

556
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,964
Please get out of my car.

557
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,265
We said no glasses.

558
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,683
Repairmen don't wear glasses.

559
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,109
And put your phone on silent.

560
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:44,896
All right.

561
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:47,857
Come on.

562
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,197
Good, okay.

563
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:27,396
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, you'll wake Pauline.

564
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,529
No.

565
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,421
Got you, you son of a bitch.

566
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,650
I thought I heard someone.

567
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,402
Sorry, I--

568
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,028
It's quite all right.

569
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,198
Did you find what you were
looking for in John's office?

570
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:21,909
Yes, ma'am.

571
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,705
Sorry, didn't mean to disturb you.

572
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:29,625
No bother, hardly a
day goes by that John

573
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,961
doesn't send one of his deputies around

574
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:36,883
to retrieve something he forgot
when he left for the office.

575
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:40,344
I'm Mary Stone, John's mother.

576
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,512
Which one are you?

577
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,515
I'm Brian.

578
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:49,437
Brian, you must be one
of John's new deputies.

579
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:50,771
Yes, ma'am.

580
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,023
Second week on the job.

581
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:56,402
Like I say, he's always in a
hurry to be

582
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,446
on his way in the morning.

583
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,948
What was it today?

584
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,491
Don't rightly know, Mrs. Stone.

585
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:06,787
Just an envelope, don't
know what's inside it.

586
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,748
Speaking of which, I should
probably--

587
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:09,749
Oh no, no.

588
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:12,376
No rushing off.

589
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,171
John will understand.

590
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:18,007
I always make it a point to get
to know

591
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,717
all of John's deputies.

592
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,554
May I take your arm, Deputy?

593
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:33,648
We always take time in this
house for tea and cookies.

594
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:39,570
I've learned my way around
this house very well

595
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,280
since I came here.

596
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:48,871
Almost two years now, but the
stairs can be tricky for me.

597
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:55,127
My mind wanders or forget
how many steps there are.

598
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,005
Did you tell me your last name?

599
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,342
My short term memory's getting
to be a problem, I'm afraid.

600
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,218
It's Wakefield.

601
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:06,681
Now the kitchen's around this way.

602
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,601
Wakefield, Wakefield.

603
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:13,521
Not the Wakefields that
raise horses near Jasper.

604
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,155
Shit.

605
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,504
Sheriff.

606
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,880
Hey, Megan.

607
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,090
What are you doing here?

608
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:47,513
I was on my way to Rick's
place and it just died.

609
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,266
Happened to just coast here, I guess.

610
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:53,019
Well just pop the hood
and I'll take a look, okay?

611
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,353
Yeah, thank you.

612
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,541
Okay, now try it.

613
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,253
Sounds great.

614
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,844
Well, Megan, if I were you,

615
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,264
I'd go straight to Vinny's
and get that battery checked.

616
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,266
Yes, sir, will do.

617
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,104
Thank you.

618
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,189
My pleasure.

619
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:59,794
The water's hot, if you
wouldn't mind pouring for me.

620
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,255
I love those homemade cookies

621
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,841
that Ginger Wilson makes for me.

622
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,593
But sometimes I have to hide them

623
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:11,222
because John can go through a
half a dozen

624
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,474
with his bedtime glass of milk.

625
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,477
You know Ginger, don't you?

626
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,979
Of course I know Ginger.

627
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:34,662
Mrs. Stone, I should--

628
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,500
It's a 357 Magnum.

629
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:44,255
Please, stay seated whoever you are.

630
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,549
Judge, how you doing?

631
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:51,345
I may be blind, but I never
miss a point blank range.

632
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,849
I gotta call you back, Judge.

633
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:01,564
Shit.

634
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,067
Mother, for god's sake.

635
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,237
Oh, John, I think he went
out the way of the foyer.

636
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,365
Put that thing down.

637
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,117
I've told you and I've told you

638
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,120
that the trigger pull on
this piece is too long.

639
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:35,139
Come on, come on, please, please.

640
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,359
Shit.

641
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:09,757
Where's Cruz?

642
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:10,841
She's on her way.

643
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,718
Should be here by now.

644
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,928
Check around back, he's armed.

645
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:16,555
I'm sure he's gone by now,
but see what you can see.

646
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,389
Gotcha.

647
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,208
What the hell?

648
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,244
Hero, thank
God, I've been trying

649
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:21,495
to get ahold of you.

650
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,747
Hero, what happened to you?

651
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,209
Hero, can you hear me?

652
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,043
Hero?

653
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,228
Here, let me give you a hand
with that.

654
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,229
Thank you.

655
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,707
Hey, you've reached Megan.

656
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,377
Leave a message and maybe
I'll get back to you.

657
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,119
Now what?

658
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,838
Come on, she's needing you
real bad.

659
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:18,797
Where?

660
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:19,840
Where it all began.

661
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,305
Better grab ahold, son.

662
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,898
Okay, that hurt.

663
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:03,467
Taryn.

664
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:07,971
I'm here.

665
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,350
How do you do that?

666
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,976
I can't.

667
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,520
At least not without you.

668
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,230
I, I don't understand.

669
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,524
We've always been better together.

670
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:19,733
The two of us.

671
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,364
We're where it first began.

672
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:26,323
Stone.

673
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,659
No, it's deeper than that.

674
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:33,664
I know you felt it, that
connection to this place,

675
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,666
to each other.

676
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,459
The city.

677
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,087
It is here, isn't it?

678
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:42,631
Yes, where we first met.

679
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:44,841
First fell in love.

680
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:51,181
We've been doing this dance
for a, a very long time.

681
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,309
And hopefully we'll do it again.

682
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,353
But right now, I need you to
focus, Hero.

683
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,565
I wish we had the luxury
of time, but we don't.

684
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,066
What do you need me to do.

685
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,150
Open yourself to me.

686
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,820
I need to use you as a conduit.

687
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,129
Stop, stop, stop.

688
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:23,755
It's like my head's on fire.

689
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:26,466
You'll be fine.

690
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:30,095
It's always difficult at
first, but you'll get stronger.

691
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,639
You have to get stronger.

692
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,057
Wait, no, Taryn.

693
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,436
I've got the disk.

694
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,814
I saw what that bastard did.

695
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,442
We've got him.

696
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:44,985
And hopefully it's enough.

697
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:50,115
But I can't risk that, we can't.

698
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:54,286
If it comes to it, you
have to show everyone.

699
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:56,204
Taryn, I have no idea what I'm
doing.

700
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:58,540
Can't you just--

701
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,335
I don't know if I'm
gonna have any energy left.

702
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,586
Focus on the truth, Hero.

703
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,383
I need to go rest up for the big day.

704
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,303
You can rely on Jacob.

705
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:13,388
How am I supposed to find a ghost.

706
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,848
He'll know when you need him.

707
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,229
Jacob's not a ghost, he's an angel.

708
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,193
Terrific.

709
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:43,251
Hero.

710
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,549
Her--

711
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,717
Oh, thank God.

712
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,263
Hero, I got food.

713
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:03,563
Hero.

714
00:58:10,237 --> 00:58:11,071
Hero?

715
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:52,446
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, you'll wake Pauline.

716
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:58,118
No.

717
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:09,045
That wasn't so bad,
was it?

718
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,464
No, no.

719
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,469
Where is he, Megan?

720
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:16,470
Where is he?

721
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:33,820
Listen, there's always a
little blood in the beginning.

722
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,280
A little pain.

723
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,698
It'll get better.

724
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,056
That's all right, baby.

725
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,893
I'm fine to myself.

726
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:10,649
Thou shalt not kill, John.

727
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,276
Jesus.

728
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:20,784
John.

729
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,213
Oh, thank God.

730
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,174
Megan?

731
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:45,684
Oh God.

732
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,437
Megan.

733
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:51,398
Megan.

734
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:55,694
Megan.

735
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:19,885
How's she doing?

736
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:21,928
She'll make it, but I've
got some airway concerns.

737
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,763
Whoever it was, was one strong dude.

738
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,316
Is she gonna die?

739
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:37,527
All I can tell you, is her
spirit ain't left her body.

740
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:41,990
This is all my fault.

741
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:45,076
What am I gonna do now?

742
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:48,788
In a couple hours Taryn's
body's gonna be buried

743
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,499
and her spirit's gonna be
stuck here, maybe for eternity.

744
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:53,293
Whoa, whoa wait.

745
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,795
This ain't no time to be crying
the blues.

746
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,714
Now you know what's got to be done.

747
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:02,969
Bad odds, they'll shoot
me down in the street.

748
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:06,389
Now listen, the Lord looks
with favor

749
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,807
on the righteous, son.

750
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:22,781
Get this to the lab.

751
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:23,740
Yeah, you got it.

752
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,368
What the hell happened here?

753
01:02:26,368 --> 01:02:28,244
Whoever he was, he was in a hurry.

754
01:02:29,788 --> 01:02:31,164
Some more blood splattered
over here,

755
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,000
but it's not as if he cut an artery.

756
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:37,295
Why don't you go ahead and
track it.

757
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,047
I'll see how far it goes.

758
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:14,040
Now, slay all the whores of Babylon.

759
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:19,337
For they stand between
the just and the righteous

760
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:22,340
in the throne of heaven.

761
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:31,141
John, it's late.

762
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,059
You should be in bed.

763
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:41,526
I've always, always
done the Lord's will.

764
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,946
Obeyed His judgments.

765
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,908
Even when they confused me, mother.

766
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:50,785
I know.

767
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:57,792
And I've dedicated my
life, my life mother,

768
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,672
to the destruction of the
kingdom of evil

769
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,966
wherever I find it on this earth.

770
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,052
I know.

771
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:17,520
I have licked the
wine of her fornications

772
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,481
from my fingertips.

773
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:28,656
And yet, she is not dead.

774
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:35,163
John, please.

775
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,289
You're overtired.

776
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,167
Come to bed.

777
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:41,961
She is not dead.

778
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:46,049
And still, she stands between
all of us

779
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,383
at the throne of heaven.

780
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:56,392
And God, God torments me in His silence.

781
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:13,743
What, what do I do now?

782
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:16,913
What?

783
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:35,348
Pray, John.

784
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:45,567
Yes.

785
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:49,070
Yes.

786
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:05,480
She gonna make it?

787
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,482
He almost crushed her windpipe.

788
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:09,609
I overheard the nurses talking.

789
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:10,610
She'll pull through.

790
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,029
If I had been there--

791
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,906
You'd both be dead.

792
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,741
Don't underestimate him.

793
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,117
He's quick and he's strong.

794
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,372
Promise me you'll take care of her.

795
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,126
You need to get going, now.

796
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:30,421
Now.

797
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:35,093
What are you doing here?

798
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:36,552
It's after hours.

799
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:37,595
I know, I'm sorry.

800
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:38,930
I was just leaving.

801
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,974
You need to stay right here.

802
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:44,352
Security.

803
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:47,230
Security.

804
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,402
Hey, you.

805
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,873
Hi, can you tell me what
room Megan Holloway's at.

806
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,714
512.

807
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:14,924
Security, 1033 on the
fifth floor.

808
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,342
Security--
- Where are the stairs?

809
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:17,719
Intruder on the fifth floor.

810
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:20,346
Have security meet
me on the fifth floor.

811
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:31,858
Come on, come on.

812
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,781
Not this way, get to the roof.

813
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:39,615
Why?

814
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:40,450
Just go.

815
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,119
I'll explain everything on the way.

816
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:11,689
Deputy Sheriff, stop.

817
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:15,026
No.

818
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,031
No.

819
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,366
Take it easy, now.

820
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:22,742
You don't wanna be up there.

821
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:26,245
I didn't do anything, he set
me up.

822
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,373
Okay, let's talk about that.

823
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:30,375
You come any closer, I jump.

824
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:31,709
Okay, easy.

825
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,003
Hero, right?

826
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,298
I'm Lara.

827
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:38,549
I didn't kill Taryn.

828
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,427
I didn't hurt Megan either.

829
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:44,722
Please, you have to stop him.

830
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:46,307
Who is he?

831
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:48,267
You won't believe me.

832
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,436
I believe you.

833
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,355
And we need to find out what happened.

834
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:53,189
You and me.

835
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:56,401
I'm not falling for that.

836
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:02,031
Open your eyes before it's too late.

837
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:04,200
No, shit.

838
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:16,462
What kept you?

839
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,463

Tragically, Taryn's parents died

850
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,866
when she was very, very young.

851
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:31,871
But John and his dearly
departed wife, Pauline,

852
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:34,457
took her in, gave her a home,

853
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:36,709
and raised her as their very own.

854
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:41,214
So John, would you like to come up

855
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:42,965
and say a few words for us,
please?

856
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,554
Thank you.

857
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:52,350
And thank you, Miranda for...

858
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:08,741
I know that the song
that you chose was one

859
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:11,452
of Taryn's favorites because
I would hear her at night

860
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:17,416
at home in her room alone
singing it

861
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:19,252
over and over to the music.

862
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:22,672
And yes, the

863
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:30,888
And yes, the (coughing), words
were especially meaningful...

864
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:36,644
It's all right, John.

865
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:37,770
It's all right.

866
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,938
Must be the flowers.

867
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:49,156
I'm afraid that I didn't see
Taryn as much

868
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:50,866
as I would have liked around here.

869
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:57,415
But I know and believe that
Jesus lived always in her heart.

870
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:02,878
So I know we will all excuse her

871
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:05,798
for the anger and
confusion she was feeling.

872
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:10,428
Now, I would like to invite you all

873
01:13:10,428 --> 01:13:13,598
to follow the procession
to the grave site service.

874
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:16,952
No baby, your sister did
not see me on Friday night.

875
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:23,209
Okay Taryn, do your stuff.

876
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:25,711
- No, I was goin--
- That's tellin' her.

877
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:26,545
Boo.

878
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:36,681
Sorry.

879
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:39,058
Get out of the car.

880
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,518
Stop.

881
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:41,519
Hey, come on.

882
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:45,648
What should I do?

883
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,483
Just, just follow that hearse.

884
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:52,780
John, what is it,
what's wrong?

885
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:53,906
I don't know, momma.

886
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:55,991
Lara.

887
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:57,368
This is Cruz, go ahead.

888
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:59,328
Someone hijacked
the hearse from the funeral.

889
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,455
They're southbound on
68 near Beaver Falls.

890
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:02,665
Copy that, we're in route.

891
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:04,250
Hit the lights.

892
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:13,259
Pull over now and stop the vehicle.

893
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:15,594
Don't lose him, don't lose him.

894
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:16,679
Over there.

895
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:27,481
Get over to the side of the road.

896
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:28,315
Pull over.

897
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:30,735
Pull over, now.

898
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:19,283
Get out of the hearse,
show me your hands.

899
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:20,201
Stay here.

900
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:30,419
Stand down, stand down.

901
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:34,548
Is everybody here?

902
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:36,217
Get out, slow.

903
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:47,645
You're in a world of trouble, son.

904
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:48,854
What you're gonna slaughter me
too?

905
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,898
She was punished according to
her sin.

906
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:51,732
No, I saw you.

907
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:54,318
I felt what you did to her.

908
01:16:54,318 --> 01:16:57,321
Any evil you saw in her was
just a reflection of you.

909
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:58,614
You can't prove a thing.

910
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,246
I'm not the one who's going to.

911
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:14,463
Mommy look.

912
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,007
We didn't do anything.

913
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:17,842
Liar.

914
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:31,689
Oh my lord, what is happening?

915
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,235
You, you're doing this.

916
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,405
What have you done?

917
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,075
What's wrong with you?

918
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,660
But she had to die.

919
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:45,870
Don't you understand?

920
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:50,207
Tammy, Sandy, you know
what I'm saying is true.

921
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,917
It's there, in the Bible.

922
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:54,128
Revelations, Mark.

923
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:56,297
Amber.

924
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:02,011
Heed the word, listen to me, people.

925
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:02,845
Listen to me.

926
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:03,888
Don't do it, John.

927
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:05,431
Let Hero go.

928
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:08,767
Haven't I always done
what I felt was necessary

929
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:12,187
to keep the evil from this earth.

930
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:16,275
To keep the evil from darkening
the sky,

931
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:18,736
like it's darkening our soul.

932
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:22,489
The evil that's in that
young whore, fawning.

933
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:23,949
Stop, that's
blasphemy.

934
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:25,242
Drop the knife, Sheriff.

935
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:31,874
No, remember, remember
the prophesy in Revelation.

936
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:36,921
Come out of her, people,
lest you be part of her sin.

937
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:41,467
Lest you share in her plague.

938
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:43,802
John?

939
01:18:44,929 --> 01:18:45,721
Mother.

940
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:49,642
Whatever you have done, John,

941
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,938
there is forgiveness for all sins.

942
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,691
Please don't hurt me anymore.

943
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:06,450
Only one way to salvation.

944
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,621
What is that way, John?

945
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:13,666
It's, it's, it's blood.

946
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,253
Mother.

947
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:25,135
Shed blood.

948
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:28,722
- Oh John.
- No, no.

949
01:19:46,907 --> 01:19:47,741
Hero.

950
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,631
So, it worked?

951
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,717
You're getting stronger.

952
01:20:04,717 --> 01:20:05,718
You came to me.

953
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:08,679
And are you?

954
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:11,306
Good, for the first time in a while.

955
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:13,934
Good.

956
01:20:17,896 --> 01:20:20,357
Find me a little sooner next
time?

957
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:21,734
You always find me first.

958
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:26,780
Thank you, Hero, for everything.

959
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,734
Whatcha thinking about?

960
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:05,527
These were left here this morning.

961
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:10,574
They look fresh.

962
01:21:12,326 --> 01:21:14,578
All I know is they
weren't here last night.

963
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,210
Then you think it's
her way of telling us?

964
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:25,297
Wherever she is, she made it.

965
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,513
Well I guess we
got a lot of work to do, huh?

966
01:21:32,513 --> 01:21:33,847
How do you figure?

967
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:35,224
The lost city.

968
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:37,810
You're the most famous guy
in Carver County right now.

969
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,646
I mean, just wait 'til
this hits the internet.

970
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:43,524
I figure we buy two
shovels and start digging.

971
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:44,441
Shovels?

972
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:48,987
Do you realize how expensive
an archeological dig is?

973
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:49,905
No idea.

974
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:57,704

getting my archeology degree.
