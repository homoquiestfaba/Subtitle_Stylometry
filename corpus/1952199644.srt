Mexican ass can't afford--

Old ass man.

I'm gonna tell you the difference

- What's that? You tell me.
- I'm legal.

62
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,827

Wait. You want your ma to kill us?

- when we get up there.
- Papo, what's the rush?

68
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,848
Your aunt's still pissed that we were late
to Mauricio's wedding.

69
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,786
Are you kidding me?
You're still harping on that?

70
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,016
The priest passed out
from heat stroke!

71
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,787
Dude, everybody knows
I need 15 minutes to blow-dry my hair.

- Yeah.
- What's up?

78
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,235
Are you crazy?
It's freaking cold out there.

79
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,010
I'm not gonna
stop the car.

80
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,534
- Stop the car!
- I'm not getting out!

81
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:50,140
- It's cold!
- Johnny! Ozzy!

82
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,674
Come here, bro.
What are you doing?

83
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,914
Oh, shit.

84
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,353
( both panting )

85
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,950

86
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,336
Welcome back, coz.

87
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,338
Welcome back.

88
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,465
Ozzy:
Welcome back to Humble Park, man.

89
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,574
You feel sick?
You don't look sick.

90
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,545
Are you sure this medicine is not
gonna make me drowsy?

91
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,047
- Hi, Edy.
- I don't want to fall asleep

92
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,673
at my girl's
office party.

93
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,843
You're gonna be the most
beautiful woman there.

94
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,580
Thank you, Papi.
I'll see you later.

95
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,554
Okay.

96
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,989
( speaks Spanish )

97
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,054
- What?
- You know what, Don Juan.

98
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,291
If I didn't admire her,
she'd be insulted.

99
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,562
Please! Like you look
at Sister Maria here like that.

100
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,570
I wasn't always a nun.

101
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,799
Oh no.

102
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,864
Brother's even
stealing Santa suits.

103
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,637
Why don't you sit
on Santa's lap

104
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,973
and give me
your wish list?

105
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,707
$1, one menthol.

106
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,214
Why don't
you add 99 to that,

107
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,149
pay me back for
the Trinidad-Jones fight?

108
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,776
That fight was
over a year ago.

109
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:01,980
I swear, I'm never betting
with you again, Spencer.

110
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,784
30 years, you've never
ponied up once.

111
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,313
And why you bet
on Trinidad, anyway?

112
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,258
I usually never bet when
two brothers are fighting.

113
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,555
Trinidad is Puerto Rican.

114
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,221
How many times do
I have to explain to you

115
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,560
Puerto Ricans
ain't black?

116
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,292
Come on,
you know damn well

117
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,129
if Trinidad wasn't black,
I'd never bet on him.

118
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,726
I always bet
on the black man.

119
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,135
Lakers versus Celtics,
I always went Lakers.

120
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,833
Tiger versus the white boy
of the month...

121
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,465
I always go Tiger.

122
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,409
The only time I ever lost
was Apollo versus Rocky,

123
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,776
but I think
that shit was fixed.

124
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,440
Whatever.
Can I have my money?

125
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,312
If I prove to you that
Puerto Ricans are black,

126
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,577
then I don't owe you
one thin dime.

127
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,484
- Edy: Get out.
- Dad! Papi!

128
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,648
- Hey, Spence. Look at you.
- Hey, Mauricio.

129
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,783
- I like the black Santa scam.
- Hey, you know me.

130
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,453
Too bad Santa
only comes once a year.

131
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,359
- Know what I mean?
- Got that right.

132
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,364
Dad.
How's it going?

133
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,265
I couldn't just drive by
without paying tribute, you know?

134
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,963
- ( laughs )
- Look at you.

135
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,470
How come
he gets to flirt?

136
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,699
'Cause he's mine.

137
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,139
- Hi, Tina.
- Hi.

138
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,143
- Nice blouse.
- Thank you.

139
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,441
Anna gave it to me
for my birthday last year.

140
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,004
Whoa.
Don't flash like that.

141
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,209
I'm a married man.
Cover them up.

142
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,150
( both laugh )

143
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,618
Just kidding.

144
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,382
- That blouse Tina was wearing?
- Yeah?

145
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,856
I gave it to your mom
two Christmases ago.

146
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:15,122
Maybe it was a little too Lieutenant Uhura,
"Star Trek" for her.

147
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,061
Come on, Sarah.
Where's your Christmas spirit?

148
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,530
Where's hers?
She regifts everything.

149
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,965
Last year she gave me
a basket of toiletries with

150
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,128
with "Doubletree" and "Boca"
printed on it.

151
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,468
- Really?
- I still have the body lotion.

152
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,565
Oh, Sarah, come on.
Hey, do you know what would be

153
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,200
a great Christmas present
for my parents?

154
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,040
- TiVo?
- No no.

155
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,978
If we tell them we're
trying to have a baby.

156
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,503
- A baby?
- Yeah.

157
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,914
Are you high?
( laughs )

158
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,646
- We discussed this.
- No. No no no no no no no.

159
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,711
We're still in discussion
about this.

160
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,382
What are we gonna say to
my mom when she's all,

161
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:47,483
"All my friends have
grandchildren.

162
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,324
My mother had 10 grandchildren
when she was my age"?

163
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,728
We'll tell her
to adopt an embryo

164
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,527
and have one herself.

165
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,534
( water running )

166
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,468
( man speaking
Spanish on radio )

167
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,695
( door opens )

168
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,530
- Merry Christmas.
- Feliz Navidad.

169
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,732
Ay, mi niño!

170
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,705
You look so handsome.

171
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,474
- Hello, Sarah.
- Hello.

172
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,314
You went to the bodega
before you came home first?

173
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,818
- Yeah, well--
- What difference does it make?

174
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,581
They're here now.

175
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,749
You're lucky to have ran
into him at the bodega.

176
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,385
He's a little hard
to get ahold of these days.

177
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,329
( speaks Spanish )

178
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,958
Mira, she's almost
a Puerto Rican.

179
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,661
( speaks Spanish )

180
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,104
I'm sorry, can you say that
more slowly

181
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,903
and just enunciate
a little more clearly?

182
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,604
Yeah, well, she saying
"How are you?"

183
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,476
She says, "How are you?"
How are you?

184
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,277
- Oh. Muy bien.
- There you go.

185
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,149
It looks like you've lost
a little bit of weight.

186
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,620
( speaks Spanish )

187
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,017
She said
that you look great.

188
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,822
Oh. Thank you.
I just started Pilates.

189
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,659
Ay, bendito.
When am I gonna have grandchildren?

190
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,324
My mother had 10
at my age.

191
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,163
All of my friends
have grandchildren.

192
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,362
I'm going to be the only
Puerto Rican grandmother

193
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,633
who's gonna have to
adopt grandchildren.

194
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,606
Anna, leave
the children alone.

195
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,370
Do you want to drive them
back to New York?

196
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:45,138
Thanks, Dad.

197
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,701
Anybody else home yet?

198
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,213
Our little
Hollywood movie star

199
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,839
is about to pull up
in her limo any minute.

200
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,194
Merry Christmas!

201
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:15,173
- Edy: Oh, it's our little movie star!
- Hi, Dad.

202
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,506
- Stop stop stop.
- Mom, you're like paparazzi.

203
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,739
- Hi, Mom!
- Where's the limo driver?

204
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,577
He had another pickup
at the airport.

205
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,810
Hi, Mami. How are you?
Where's Jesse?

206
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,182
- Is he here yet?
- Johnny and Ozzy went to pick him up.

207
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,709
Oh God,
he'd be safer in lraq.

208
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,847
- ( Ozzy grunts )
- Whoa!

209
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,688
- ( Ozzy laughs )
- Yo, Ozzy!

210
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,751
- My bad, man!
- Come on, bro.

211
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,820
You threw that
like Marcia Brady.

212
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,058
Hey, I'm not the one who wore diapers
in Little League.

213
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,726
For your information,
Mr. Asshole,

214
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,065
they were disposable
underwear. okay?

215
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,435
- I had a bladder problem.
- Yeah, a lot of girls have that problem.

216
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,099
Johnny: There was
an epidemic going on.

217
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,199
There were thousands of kids
having to wear those.

218
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:52,836
- Epidemic.
- Can we get to the game?

219
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,675
Johnny:
What you think we're doing?

220
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,705
Talking like two old ladies.
Come on, man.

221
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,341
- You swing like one.
- Here comes the heat, baby.

222
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,614
Throw that like a man.
I ain't got all day.

223
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:05,555
- Oh! Home run!
- Johnny: Oh!

224
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,787
I could've caught that.

225
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,693
Come on! Catch the ball,
you old ass man!

226
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,698
Oh!

227
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,792
- Come on, man!
- Johnny! Come on!

228
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,133
I threw it right to him.
He could've caught that.

229
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,863
Jesse: Ozzy!

230
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,308
Yo! Come on, man!

231
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,744
Ozzy, what are you doing?
Throw the ball!

232
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,044
Yo! Freaking
freezing out here!

233
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,913
Let's go, papo!

234
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,919
Ozzy!

235
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,978
What are you doing, man?

236
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,579
Give me the ball.

237
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,417
( chatting )

238
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:51,895
Ozzy. Chill, man.
Don't do nothing stupid.

239
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,269
I can't believe that
bitch Alexis is out.

240
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,467
He killed
my brother, man.

241
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,568
That punk-ass,
he kills his brother

242
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,272
and he's hanging out
like nothing happened?

243
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,802
What kind of justice
is that, Jesse?

244
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,405
- Jesse: Come on.
- Come on, man.

245
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,474
"Come on" what, bro?
It's not even worth it.

246
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,146
- What are you trying to say?
- Johnny: Not even worth it.

247
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,818
Got your name up
on a billboard, Jesse,

248
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,795
Iike when Jordan came back
to the United Center.

249
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,094
Whole neighborhood gonna be lining up,
welcoming you back.

250
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,531
A Boricua war
hero, pal.

251
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,536
Puerto Rico, whoa!

252
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,403
- Puerto Rico, whoa!
- ( horn plays tune )

253
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,842
Ay, Dios mio.
Ay, bendito.

254
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:34,675
My baby.
Mi niño.

255
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,045
Mi vida.

256
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,915
- Preciosos, you're home. I can't believe it.
- Hey, Ma.

257
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,512
What is it going to take
for you two to be on time?

258
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,788
- The hair. The hair.
- Anna: Your hair.

259
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,818
- Come on.
- Are you okay?

260
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,353
Huh? I'm good.
I'm good.

261
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,889
Thank God you never have to go back
to that place again.

262
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,835
I swear if I ever meet those
people that hurt you, baby,

263
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,499
- I'll kill them.
- Hey, Uncle Edy. How you doing?

264
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,064
Oh, you're smothering him.

265
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,906
Give the boy
a chance to breathe.

266
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,810
Mauricio: You look like
a Puerto Rican Gorbachev.

267
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,815
- Hi.
- ( both laugh )

268
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,680
- What's up, Roxanna?
- Hey.

269
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,845
- Yo, Mauricio.
- It's so good to see you.

270
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,989
You too.
You look good.

271
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,152
- ( Christmas music playing )
- ( people chatting )

272
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,888
Jesse: The Penn game.
Dad, we're missing the Penn game.

273
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,726
- ( TV hissing )
- ( Jesse laughs )

274
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,426
- ( glasses clink )
- Johnny: Gracia, Mamita.

275
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,195
Hey, Ma,
did Sarah tell you?

276
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,671
She was a big hit
at her office Christmas party.

277
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,674
- She made coquito from scratch.
- Anna: You did?

278
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,835
- Can you believe that?
- I Googled the recipe.

279
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,107
Why didn't you call me
instead of this Google?

280
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,113
- It's a search engine.
- Ma.

281
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,614
I needed it quickly.

282
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,583
I thought
it would be fun.

283
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,779
There's some Puerto Ricans
who work in the firm.

284
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,687
As what? Janitors?
An assistant lavaplatos?

285
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,352
- Ozzy: Probably.
- Sarah: Jose is an associate.

286
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,361
- An associate.
- How nice.

287
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,920
And I told them
how we celebrate the parranda,

288
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,932
where we sing
the Christmas carols

289
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,958
and go house to house
to surprise the neighbors.

290
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,234
Wow, Mo, I didn't know your girl
was so down with the neighborhood.

291
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,638
( speaks Spanish )

292
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,266
I know.
Sarah's a volunteer.

293
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,901
What do you have to
offer the world, Johnny?

294
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,571
What's your
contribution besides

295
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:16,240
zero money down
and debt into afterlife?

296
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,182
- Oh!
- ( all laugh )

297
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,320
I got him good
with that afterlife jab.

298
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,481
Okay, enough enough.
I want to propose a toast.

299
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:28,823
Here's to having
everybody home,

300
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,829
especially Jesse.

301
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,797
- All: Salut.
- Roxanna: To Jesse.

302
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,321
Jesse. L'Chaim.

303
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,802
Ozzy: What?
What he say?

304
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,396
Jesse, I want
to ask you:

305
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,430
Did you see
some of that messed up

306
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,635
"Black Hawk Down"
type of shit over there?

307
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,872
Did that really
happen that way?

308
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,450
I don't know, man.
I--

309
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,509
Edy:
He doesn't want to talk about that.

310
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,249
- You don't wanna talk about that.
- It's okay.

311
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,189
You talk
when you're ready.

312
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:01,818
I'm gonna
go check the rice.

313
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,421
So, Tio Edy, when are you gonna
come down to the store

314
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,763
so I can set you up with a beautiful
plasma flat-screen TV?

315
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,962
I don't need one of those.
This TV is perfectly fine.

316
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,494
- Oh.
- That always works.

317
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,201
Johnny: You could watch the Cubs
in high definition.

318
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:17,708
So I could have
a crystal clear image

319
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,438
of seeing them getting
their asses kicked?

320
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,207
- No no, gracia.
- ( Johnny chuckles )

321
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,305
- So, Roxanna, mi amor.
- Mmm?

322
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,044
So tell us what's
going on in Hollywood.

323
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,676
( effeminately )
Yeah, who's gay now?

324
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,710
You, you stupid ass.

325
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,847
The gay gene skipped
my side of the family.

326
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,983
Yeah, right. Like Uncle Roy who still
has a roommate at 60.

327
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,517
- That's right, a "roommate."
- Life partner, man.

328
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,360
Enough. You hear back
from that TV show?

329
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,832
Dad, they haven't decided yet.
But they said I brought

330
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,893
an organic vulnerability
to the character that plays as cultural--

331
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,701
You'd definitely play a much more organic
Mexican than Oz over here.

332
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,401
- Roxanna: Don't start.
- What are you talking about?

333
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,306
- What? Start what?
- You know.

334
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,743
- What do I know?
- You almost went there. Forget it.

335
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,974
- How'd I almost go there?
- Nothing, forget it.

336
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,212
- Say the line.
- You're supposed to be on my side.

337
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,742
- Say the line. Say the line.
- No.

338
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,550
- Say the line.
- Do the line.

339
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,353
Sorry. Onto bigger
and better things.

340
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,189
Come on, baby.
It's not like a million people

341
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,560
haven't already seen you
in that sexy peasant blouse,

342
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,929
batting your beautiful
brown eyes for Señor Taco.

343
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,491
You know what?
I've got the bootleg too.

344
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,526
All right,
I'll say the line.

345
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,401
( speaks Spanish )

346
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,100
Johnny:
No no, it's more like...

347
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,076
- ( speaks effeminately )
- Roxanna: Oh, stop.

348
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,543
It's-- it's...

349
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:30,915
- ( laughing )
- Jesse: No no no no no.

350
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,917
You'd better watch it.
You'd better watch it.

351
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,919
Assholes.

352
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,047
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough.

353
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,025
So tell me, this new show
you're up for...

354
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,755
It's a midseason replacement

355
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,888
and it's coming on after
"Desperate Housewives,"

356
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,761
- which is big.
- Sarah: Oh wow.

357
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,630
- Are you gonna be able to meet them?
- I might, actually.

358
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,635
What about you, Sarah?
How's work?

359
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,637
- Yeah, what's going on on Wall Street?
- Roxanna: Yeah.

360
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:54,536
Yeah, how are you
guys gonna have enough time

361
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,438
to make some kind of
sorta-Ricans?

362
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,773
No, we are.
Not right away,

363
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,403
We've got plenty of time.
What's the rush?

364
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,279
Why are you throwing me
with the baby Latin curve here?

365
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,580
By now you guys should be up to four,
five, six, maybe seven, eight kids.

366
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,745
- Mauricio: Come on.
- Yo, does your plumbing work?

367
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:12,052
My pipes flow just fine. You want to check,
Johnny? Want to take a gander?

368
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,820
Why you getting
so macho about yourself?

369
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,486
We're all here, brother.
You can talk to us.

370
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,552
If I needed somebody
to talk to,

371
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,894
- you'd be the last person I would go to.
- Right.

372
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,594
I'm gonna ask Anna
if she needs any help in the kitchen.

373
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,795
- Roxanna: That's great.
- What did I do?

374
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,395
You know
why you're single?

375
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,632
'Cause every time
you open your mouth

376
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,334
it's like
a woman repellant.

377
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,103
The women go whoosh!
Just saying.

378
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,236
I'm just saying.
Look, I understand.

379
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,246
It's gotta be hard,
especially for two

380
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,680
obviously successful
people like yourselves.

381
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,411
I didn't know that's
what you were going for.

382
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,578
- Yeah.
- Well, thank you. I love you.

383
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,485
You know, this is
as good as any time.

384
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:45,820
I wanted
to tell all of you

385
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,452
that they're
talking partnership at the law firm.

386
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,485
- No.
- And I've been groomed by the COO,

387
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:52,861
so it's an almost
guaranteed slot in there.

388
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,593
- Roxanna: Great.
- Work work work.

389
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,464
Mauricio, all you talk about is work.
It's a holiday.

390
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,163
What's important is
everybody's here together.

391
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,933
We're all together now.
That's what's important.

392
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,464
- Yeah.
- That's great.

393
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,444
- Doesn't matter.
- ( doorbell rings )

394
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,311
I'm-- I'm gonna
go get the door.

395
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,044
- ( ringtone plays )
- Yeah, excuse me.

396
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,815
- One second.
- Johnny: Uncle Edy, slap the dinosaur.

397
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:19,483
- ( beeps )
- Hey. Please tell me you heard something.

398
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,696
- Hey.
- Hey.

399
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,202
Welcome--
welcome back.

400
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:34,899
- Th-- thank you.
- ( child giggles )

401
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,004
- Is that--
- That's Hector.

402
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,377
- My son.
- Really?

403
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,383
Oh. Hey.

404
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,385
- Marissa: Say hi.
- How are you? Give me five.

405
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:49,512
That is a good-looking kid.

406
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,420
Fernando: Had to circle the block
two times to find parking.

407
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,192
Hey, welcome back,
Jesse.

408
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,594
- Oh. Okay.
- Fernando.

409
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,031
Good to meet you.
Okay.

410
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,727
Hey, Mami. Hi.

411
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,103
Oh, hey, Mami.

412
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,870
- How are you?
- Who's the little boy?

413
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,934
Let's go upstairs.

414
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,344
Oh! This one is
the closest

415
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,245
I ever get to having
a grandchild.

416
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,113
Isn't he adorable?

417
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,882
Oh, yes.
Very very very cute.

418
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,219
Hector,
come on, behave.

419
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,122
Hey, how are you doing?
How's your mother?

420
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,218
Great. Thank you
for asking, Mr. Rodriguez.

421
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,525
- ( cell phone rings )
- Nice to see you. Oh, excuse me.

422
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,963
- I have to take this.
- Let's go say hi.

423
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,229
Yeah, hi.
Just give me one second.

424
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,099
( door closes )

425
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,366
Ma, since when did Dad get
all Dick Cheney on you?

426
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,863
Well, whoever it is, they must be
more important than his family.

427
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,968
- I've gotta finish dinner.
- Ma, what are you talking about?

428
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,706
- He didn't say that.
- Would you like any help?

429
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,236
No.

430
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,885
Roxanna:
Is it weird being a mom?

431
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,253
Woman: You were there.
You remember Rick.

432
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,316
That jerk.
He was such a bad father.

433
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,386
As soon as Hector was born,
Rick just left.

434
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,897
- Rick just split.
- Yeah.

435
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,230
But things are going really well
with me and Fernando,

436
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,237
and he treats Hector
like his own son.

437
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,239
Wow.
That's great, girl.

438
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,968
I just really love
my job.

439
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,806
Gotta be so cool to have a teacher
like you in high school.

440
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,270
You're gonna get
this gig, okay?

441
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,908
My agent says he feels
really good about it.

442
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,282
You know that Mr. Murphy
still asks about you?

443
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,911
Really?

444
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,286
He says that you
were the best actor

445
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,756
to come out
of Roberto Clemente.

446
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,282
Oh, that's so sweet.
You know what?

447
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,295
I still have that
gold-plated statuette

448
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,297
that he gave me
for playing Blanche.

449
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,993
- Do you remember?
- Do you remember this song?

450
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,867
Do l?
It's my song, girl.

451
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,803
- Oh my God.
- Turn it up.

452
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:48,328
( pop music playing )

453
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,534
# I wanna sex you up... #

454
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,100
# Now let's pour
a glass of wine #

455
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,478
# 'Cause now we're all alone,
I've been waiting... #

456
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,814
Please tell me you are not auditioning
for any musicals.

457
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,319
Stop singing.
You're gonna break the mirror.

458
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,549
Were you two kissing?

459
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,352
- Johnny.
- I wanna watch.

460
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,881
Johnny, we're having
girl time.

461
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,860
- I can share.
- No, you can't.

462
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,022
- No! Oh yeah?
- Shut up. Whoa!

463
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,396
Don't mess my hair!
Don't mess my hair up!

464
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,866
( yelling )

465
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:18,233
- Oh, man.
- Help me!

466
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,794
Come on, man!
Oh!

467
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,396
Help me out!

468
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,998
- You swing like a girl!
- Get out of the way!

469
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,339
You want a piece
of me? Huh? Huh?

470
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,004
Don't! Jesse!

471
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,672
Oh my God.

472
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:34,045
You boys, tomorrow you've got to
help me take down this tree.

473
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:36,646
Come on, Dad.
It's a holiday, for crying out loud.

474
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,555
You still do hard work,
Mr. Lawyer Man?

475
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,752
Johnny, I work out.
What are you trying to say?

476
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,057
- He works out.
- Oh yeah, you work out

477
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,929
with your $65-an-hour
trainer/lover/boyfriend.

478
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,728
( speaks Spanish )

479
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,099
( all laughing )

480
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,036
I bet your flabby ass
isn't lifting

481
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,007
60" plasmas
personally

482
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,169
to people's cars,
you pudgy bastard.

483
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,839
My ass isn't gonna be here tomorrow
chopping down no tree.

484
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,110
Big baby. Listen,
I've got a chainsaw.

485
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,379
Oh yeah, the one they used to make
Jesus's cross with.

486
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,114
It still works.
All it needs is a little oil.

487
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,782
We go to the zoo,
kidnap a couple of beavers.

488
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,291
They take it down for free.
They drag it away.

489
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,624
I've got a couple of chainsaws.
I can come by tomorrow.

490
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,424
Thanks a lot, Nando.

491
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,226
I can swing by too,
help you cut this down.

492
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,892
Edy: No, not you, Ozzy.
I need you at the store.

493
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,594
Why you want to cut
down the tree, Pop?

494
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:26,035
I promised
your mother a view.

495
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,062
And it's old.
Look at it.

496
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,767
The base is weak.
It's leaning over to one side.

497
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,400
It's no good no more.

498
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,809
Is that you you're talking
about or the tree?

499
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,609
All:
Oh! Oh!

500
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,116
- ( all chatting )
- Dig into that.

501
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,914
No thanks.
Can you believe--

502
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,183
- I finally got him to sleep.
- He's down? Good.

503
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,788
It used to be
Logan Boulevard.

504
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,387
It used to be
a mattress store.

505
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,693
Somebody made
me pay for it.

506
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,074
Why is
everybody fighting?

507
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,974
They're not fighting.
They conversating.

508
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,777
Mom, you may be a drug dealer
by giving me that stuff there.

509
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,783
- I thought it was Roxie's.
- ( glass clinking )

510
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:15,617
Attention, por favor,
por favor.

511
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,747
I'd just like
to say something.

512
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,019
It's fantastic that
we're all together.

513
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,618
Gracia, Dio,
that we're safe, home

514
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:25,630
- and warm, indoors.
- Mauricio: Good one, Dad.

515
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,427
- I'd like to propose a toast--
- ( phone rings )

516
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,831
Johnny:
Oh, good timing.

517
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:32,303
- Excuse me.
- ( beeps )

518
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,373
There's something
I'd like to say.

519
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,172
- I'm divorcing your father.
- ( Johnny laughing )

520
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,876
- ( all laughing )
- Mauricio: That's crazy.

521
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,282
That's not a toast, okay?
Come on.

522
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,186
That's not even funny.
What is that?

523
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,849
Why? Mom, stop, please.

524
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,551
Johnny:
That don't sound like a toast to me.

525
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:54,752
( silence )

526
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,990
- Come on. Stop that, Ma.
- Roxanna: Mom.

527
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,503
- Coño.
- Why? You've been married for 36 years.

528
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,732
- You can't--
- So?

529
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,672
"So"?
You're old.

530
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,141
Who are you calling old?

531
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,700
I've got a lot
of life left in me.

532
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,302
Who do you think kept
all of this together?

533
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,574
I don't need him.

534
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,907
Well, if that's
what you want to do...

535
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:23,785
- Roxanna: What?
-...I can't stop you.

536
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,553
What?
What is going on?

537
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,221
I'm gonna step out
for a minute, get some air.

538
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,231
Ozzy, come on.

539
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:36,564
- Excuse me.
- Happy?

540
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,565
Dad, did you cheat
on her again?

541
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,403
- Papi, you cheated?
- You didn't tell me that.

542
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:44,840
- Sarah, stay out of it.
- Roxanna: Papi?

543
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,571
Did you cheat again?

544
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,044
Is that what
your mother thinks?

545
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,842
Mysterious phone calls
all the time.

546
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,678
You disappear
in the middle of the day.

547
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,207
Ay, Papi! How could you?
How could you?

548
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,117
Don't raise your voice
to me in my own house!

549
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,588
You know what?
I'm disgusted with both of you.

550
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,955
I'm so disgusted.

551
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,789
What, are you gonna
date other people?

552
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,522
For starters.

553
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,964
Oh! Excuse me.
This is making me sick.

554
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:11,059
Come on, Jesse.
Jump in any time you feel like.

555
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:14,037
Say something, will you?
Come on.

556
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,768
- It's their life.
- What? "It's their life"?

557
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:18,867
"It's their life"?

558
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,140
Three years in lraq,
and this is the wisdom you have to offer?

559
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,773
- Oh!
- It's their life. Wow.

560
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,716
That's great.
Thanks, Dad, for doing this to us.

561
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,618
Thank you for ruining our lives.
Thank you so much for that.

562
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,622
Why don't you relax?
Why don't you leave Pop alone?

563
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,216
- This isn't about you.
- That's it. Take that side.

564
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,420
- Jesse: I'm not taking a side.
- Of course you are.

565
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:38,656
Why don't you two become roommates
and go hang out at Starbucks

566
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,392
Iike the losers you are
because you screwed up

567
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,990
the best things
you ever had in your lives?

568
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,591
Anna: Mo!

569
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,604
I'm gonna take
Hector home.

570
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,902
- Yeah.
- Thank you for dinner.

571
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,931
- And thanks so much, Mo.
- I'm sorry.

572
00:26:50,976 --> 00:26:52,307
Thank you.

573
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,608
I'm sorry, Jesse.
I got a little hot-headed.

574
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,844
Just-- just--
bro, just...

575
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,881
I think you've
said enough, man.

576
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,616
Jesse, I said
I was sorry.

577
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:09,024
- Hey. Hey.
- Jesse: Yeah.

578
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,353
Why'd you have to call out
your brother like that?

579
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,659
Because I'm the only one--

580
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,893
After all
he's been through?!

581
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,428
You should concentrate
on your own relationship

582
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,063
instead of worrying
about everybody else's.

583
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,807
Well, merry goddamn
Christmas, everybody.

584
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,977
Stop.

585
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,044
Go to your room.

586
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,987
You know what?
I'm gonna do you one better, Ma.

587
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,883
Come on, Sarah.
Let's go to the Drake.

588
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,326
I haven't finished
eating yet.

589
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,327
Yeah, whatever.

590
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,666
Did you like
the tostones?

591
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,108
Delectable.

592
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,916
Nata de coco?

593
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,412
I'd love some.

594
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,057
( beeping )

595
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:17,323
Look, do you have
a Marriott or a Radisson?

596
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,421
- A Motel 8?
- ( door opens )

597
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:21,830
Look, I'll take an empty jail cell--
anything you've got.

598
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,232
- Have you gone off your meds?
- Yeah, okay.

599
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,702
Thank you very much.

600
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,205
Let me know
if anything opens up.

601
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,866
( clangs )

602
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,569
Piece of shit.

603
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,839
Sarah, let me have
your Crackberry.

604
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,846
I'm gonna call hotels.com,
see if they've got anything.

605
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,212
I know you're freaked out about this
whole divorce thing,

606
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,717
but don't you think we should stay here
and be supportive?

607
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,778
Supportive of them throwing 36 years
of their marriage down the toilet?

608
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,414
Are you kidding?
Give me that.

609
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,721
Do you want to make things worse
for your mother?

610
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,784
Her husband
cheated on her.

611
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,592
And this is coming
from the woman who reserved two rows

612
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,689
for her parents' exes at our wedding.
Just give me that.

613
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,598
- No.
- Come on. Give it to me now.

614
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:58,465
- No.
- Sarah, I'm gonna take it from you.

615
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,028
- We're staying here.
- No, we're not staying.

616
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,801
You've been bugging me for months
to stay in a hotel.

617
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,741
- Shh!
- We're not gonna stay--

618
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,641
- Shh! Do you want them to hear you?
- What?

619
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:08,703
Are you afraid they might find out
you think this place...

620
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,308
( yells ) stinks of fried pork
and chuleta, tocineta, puñeta?

621
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,011
( both panting )

622
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,486
Well, somebody's been
a naughty little girl.

623
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:25,587
You've been emailing back and forth
with this Barry Kravitz, huh?

624
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,258
Didn't you tell me you turned his job
offer down months ago

625
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:31,462
because of the traveling and
the crazy hours, the pressure?

626
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,438
They came back.
They sweetened the deal.

627
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,463
And heofferedto back

628
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,739
Brian Donaldson and l
in our own hedge fund.

629
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,112
We would be managing
$300 million just to start.

630
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:47,175
- $300 mi--
- Yeah.

631
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,618
And use of the private jet too.
Look at that.

632
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,623
Pretty sweet.
Congratulations.

633
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,488
That's great.

634
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,519
When were you planning
to break it to me gently?

635
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,963
I just--

636
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:05,834
I just needed
a little time to think it over alone.

637
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,851
- ( knocks on door )
- ( door opens )

638
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,359
Requesting a bunk,
Lance Corporal.

639
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,225
You're gonna
sleep in here?

640
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,854
Your mother threw me
out of the bedroom.

641
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:35,024
And you act surprised.

642
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:39,025
Mijo, life is
full of surprises.

643
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,630
- Oh.
- Everybody down at the bodega,

644
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,504
they're all dying
to talk to you.

645
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:46,442
Anyway, this gives us
a chance to catch up.

646
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:51,074
I'm worried
about you and Ma.

647
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,379
Yeah? We're more
worried about you.

648
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:54,612
I'm fine.

649
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,980
You know, Jesse,

650
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,856
we know you've
been through a lot.

651
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:05,693
Your mother and me,
we rented "Coming Home."

652
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,925
I'm surprised you didn't rent
"Taxi Driver."

653
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,866
Yeah, we rented
that too.

654
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,699
It's not good to keep things
bottled up inside.

655
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:15,228
You've seen some stuff--
some really bad stuff.

656
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,002
It's a war, Pop.

657
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,204
And you did
your very best.

658
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,611
You did.

659
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,156
It should've been me...

660
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,022
not Lenny.

661
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:43,227
Beating yourself up
isn't going to bring him back, mijo.

662
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,293
And if Lenny was
here right now,

663
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,395
he'd tell you
he'd want you to move on.

664
00:31:47,438 --> 00:31:49,463
His folks...

665
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,343
I can't imagine they're
having too many laughs now.

666
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,912
No.

667
00:31:59,684 --> 00:32:02,448
You call them?
It might help.

668
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,887
You know, Dad,

669
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,255
it's getting late.

670
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,484
Yeah, okay.

671
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,943
Jesus, Mo,
you scared me.

672
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:27,467
What are
you doing up here?

673
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,104
I'm just trying
to be alone, okay?

674
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,546
I've got tequila.

675
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:35,113
- All right, you can stay.
- I know.

676
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:38,486
- What a night.
- What, is this hell?

677
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,684
- Are we in hell or what?
- Yeah.

678
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,522
Hm-mmm.
Hm-mmm.

679
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,858
- It's 10 below outside.
- No way. No way.

680
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,126
Mom won't let me smoke inside.
Go crack open a window!

681
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,690
I'm not cracking a window.
I'm not smoking your pollution.

682
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,328
- Fine. Fine.
- How about that? I saved your life.

683
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,338
- Crack that.
- How come I didn't get an invite?

684
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,964
- None needed.
- No jarheads allowed, man.

685
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,804
- Ow!
- Easy!

686
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:01,369
- Give me that.
- You having a flashback?

687
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,641
Wow.

688
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,310
It's like all I need is
to be smoking a blunt

689
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,320
and listening
to Biggie Smalls.

690
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:11,686
I lost my virginity
on that couch.

691
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,351
- Me too!
- Oh, God. Hail the syphilis!

692
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,622
- Oh God, hail you.
- Move move.

693
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,629
Roxanna: Don't be mad 'cause
you were up here all alone

694
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,460
practicing dance moves
in your underwear.

695
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,865
- ( vocalizing )
- ( beatboxing )

696
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,892
Stop it.
Stop stop.

697
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,502
- Stop it.
- Roxanna: Please don't do it in those.

698
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,372
Hey, that reminds me

699
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,708
I haven't seen Dad in his underwear
in a long time.

700
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,146
- It is not pretty.
- Is this pretty?

701
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,308
Ma kicked him out of the room
and he's staying with me.

702
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,817
He deserves it.

703
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,844
How come you never told us
about him cheating before?

704
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,049
'Cause, Rox, I didn't
see anything.

705
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,820
I caught him with that little Rosa Salgado,
little Pentecostal chick.

706
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,021
Dad just gives me $100.

707
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,428
He says, "Here,
don't say nothing."

708
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,830
And you'd think he'd be too old
for that shit now.

709
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:58,233
Rox, they've got
Viagra now.

710
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,500
We're gonna be those kids that have
to shuttle between houses at Christmas.

711
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,268
No, Rox.
No we're not.

712
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,707
- No?
- No, because they're gonna sell this house

713
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,677
and they gonna move
into separate apartments.

714
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,942
And we're gonna have to stay in a hotel
when we come into town?

715
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,039
No.

716
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,050
I know Mauricio and Sarah
wouldn't mind that.

717
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,450
- The walls are thin, bro.
- Oh yeah?

718
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,716
- Why don't you mind your business?
- Ma's always talking about

719
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:20,121
moving to Puerto Rico.
She might actually do it now.

720
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,251
It'd be kind of sweet
to have a place out there.

721
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:24,261
- Did you just say kinda sweet?
- Yeah.

722
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:27,264
So you're okay with Pops moving into
a studio apartment

723
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,289
and heating up leftovers?
You're fine with that?

724
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,301
Oh, do you realize
this is probably

725
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,530
the last Christmas
that we'll spend together?

726
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,630
Why, Rox?
Why is it gonna be the last?

727
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,903
Why don't we do something?
We're gonna let them throw away

728
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,103
36 years of their marriage?
We're just gonna sit and talk about it?

729
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,806
He broke her trust!
How can she forgive him for that?

730
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,577
- What don't you understand?
- Yeah, Ma has every right to leave.

731
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,811
Hey, do you hear
yourselves?

732
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,581
You know what
you sound like?

733
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,088
You sound like people
who aren't married.

734
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,318
Let me tell you
about marriage, all right?

735
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,122
Sometimes you're in it, you feel like you
don't want the same things anymore

736
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,958
and you start going
at each other.

737
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,157
And you go at each other,
but you stick it through.

738
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,633
And at the end of that
you fall in love all over again.

739
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,602
Andthat's marriage, okay?

740
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:08,264
So don't tell me that Mom and Dad,
after all these years,

741
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,968
don't got a little bit of love left for each
other, 'cause I'm not buying that.

742
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:19,844
Preciosos,
I made some pastelillos.

743
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:25,481
Ah. Uh-huh.
You're tired.

744
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,117
Why did you have to drag
these boys out of bed?

745
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,956
- Mauricio: We're fine, Ma.
- Anna: For 25 years,

746
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:32,588
I've been begging you
to cut down that ugly tree,

747
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,120
and all of a sudden
you're gonna do it right now?

748
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,360
- Can I help you with that?
- No.

749
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,061
You've still
got it, Mamita.

750
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,537
Dirty old man.

751
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,439
Here, how about
some hot chocolate?

752
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,467
- Come on.
- Marissa: Okay, say thank you.

753
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,707
- Thank you.
- Hey, Sarah.

754
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,681
I made some pastelillos.

755
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,843
- Have one.
- No, I'm going for a jog.

756
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:57,514
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to fix the treadmill
in the guest room.

757
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:58,988
How is she going
to get pregnant

758
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,684
with all that
bouncing up and down?

759
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,158
Enough, all right?
Just leave her alone.

760
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,661
Here here here,
eat something.

761
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,754
( speaks Spanish )

762
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,357
And what, are you drunk?
Still drunk?

763
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,198
- Ma, please.
- I can't believe you spent all night

764
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,703
getting drunk
with your brothers.

765
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,865
Mauricio:
She's a bad influence, Ma.

766
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,306
Anna:
Hey, Fernando.

767
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,366
You want
some hot chocolate?

768
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,742
No thanks.
I'm all set, Mrs. Rodriguez.

769
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:24,145
- ( revving loudly )
- ( groans )

770
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,809
You're killing me.

771
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,477
Yeah!

772
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,681
This is an SR36 Wood Boss.

773
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,725
Whoa whoa!
No! Stop!

774
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,660
Turn it off!
Turn it off!

775
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,721
- What's the problem?
- It's fine.

776
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,858
But we're gonna
use mine.

777
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,926
This is a Sears
Chainomatic 3000

778
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,835
- I remember that.
- Oh, Dad, come on.

779
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,533
Chuck Norris was
on the box.

780
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,269
Everybody, careful.
Stand back.

781
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,243
- That looks really dangerous.
- ( revs up )

782
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:56,075
- Hmm?
- ( stops )

783
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:59,742
Mauricio:
You overcompensated a little bit, Dad.

784
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,048
- Coño.
- What? What?

785
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:05,385
- 'Cause he's got a little thingy.
- ( speaks Spanish )

786
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:07,186
( buzzing )

787
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,783
( revving loudly )

788
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,752
- Marissa: Oh.
- Ooh.

789
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,764
Your man sure is good
with his tool, honey.

790
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,232
Mm-hmm, and he's really
good with his hands too.

791
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,132
Marissa,
there's a child here.

792
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,262
Please, he's three, Ma.
He doesn't get innuendo.

793
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,976
Come on, give it
some force, man.

794
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:30,810
( chainsaw whines )

795
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,782
Yo, whoa whoa whoa.

796
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:35,149
- Step back.
- Mauricio: Show him how it's done, Jesse.

797
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,154
- Careful.
- Be careful.

798
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,418
Mauricio:
Show him how it's done.

799
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,584
Roxanna:
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

800
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,253
Now that's
in innuendo, girl.

801
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,057
I bet my boy Jesse
right there--

802
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,757
$20 my boy Jesse gets
that tree down.

803
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,264
I'd take Fernando.

804
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,961
Hey, you back off,
Barbie.

805
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,630
I didn't mean it that way.
It's just that he's big.

806
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,606
- ( women laughing )
- His muscles are big.

807
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,700
And l--
oh, you guys.

808
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,940
- ( laughs )
- Hey hey hey hey!

809
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,472
Don't hurt
yourself, man.

810
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,849
What happened?
What happened?

811
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,820
It's okay,
tough guy.

812
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,086
Let's see it, Nando.
Let's see what you've got.

813
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,457
- ( clunks, stops )
- Holy cow.

814
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,018
- Oh no.
- What the hell?

815
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,292
- It's cursed, Ma!
- Son of a--

816
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,992
Syphilitic tree.
Let me try it.

817
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,365
- Hold on, hold on.
- Let a real man do it.

818
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,029
Oh no.
Stop him, please.

819
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,935
- Oh no, he isn't.
- Oh, boy.

820
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,202
- Roxanna: No, Mo.
- I got it. All right.

821
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:31,139
Back off, lraq.

822
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,506
Are you gonna put money
down on your husband?

823
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,534
That he seriously
hurts himself?

824
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,307
$20. Sure why not?

825
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,474
Mauricio!
Put it down.

826
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,643
Relax. Relax, Mom.
I've got it.

827
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,347
Roxanna: You can do it.
I've got $20 on you.

828
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,685
This little--
the black cord?

829
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,850
Right there. Right there.
The black cord.

830
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,190
- ( revving )
- Yeah.

831
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:52,718
- You hear that?
- Whoa whoa whoa!

832
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:56,358
- ( revving loudly )
- Somebody do something!

833
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,460
Thank you.
Thank you.

834
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,835
- ( men yelling )
- Thanks, Sarah.

835
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:03,999
- Mauricio, put it down!
- Sarah: Told you.

836
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,066
- Don't yell at me.
- Put it down!

837
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,702
- Get in the house!
- I've got it.

838
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,576
- Anna: Put it down.
- ( chainsaw stops )

839
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,173
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody.

840
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,512
I told you--
get in the house.

841
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:43,209
Huh?
What do you think?

842
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,878
Roxanna:
It looks great, Dad.

843
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,715
I don't know
what to say.

844
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,414
- Come on.
- What?

845
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,892
- Find something to do.
- ( laughs )

846
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,919
- ( shop bell rings )
- Oh, my babies!

847
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,955
( laughing )

848
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,234
- Oh, my movie star!
- How you doing?

849
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,466
- You look great.
- Thanks.

850
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:12,874
God bless you, baby.
You know, I prayed for you every day.

851
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,208
I had to. I know how
the military is.

852
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:19,046
- Yeah.
- Hey, y'all! My baby was on the front line!

853
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,916
Figures. They like to cut
the dark meat first,

854
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:24,785
if you know what I'm saying.
I'll tell you what it is.

855
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,416
It's Uncle Sam trying
to get rid of y'all Latinos.

856
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:30,393
You know, they lure you in
promising you citizenship.

857
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,295
You don't even have to
have a green card to serve.

858
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,764
- Oh, come on, Tina.
- Oh, you know it's true, white boy.

859
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,325
- ( people chuckle )
- You find everything?

860
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,836
Yeah, I'm cool.

861
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,599
These high-end magazines
must be your touch,

862
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,072
'cause the only thing
my Pops reads

863
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,098
is "The Sun Times"
and "La Opinión."

864
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,908
You want to see
something really cool?

865
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,609
Check this out. It's all about what's
happening underground

866
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,142
with music, art, theater--
that kind of stuff.

867
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,985
- Mmm.
- You ever think about doing theater?

868
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:00,490
Yeah, I started
in theater.

869
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,856
But I'm just focused
on film and TV now.

870
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,191
Yeah. You know
what you should do?

871
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,323
- Telenovela.
- Oh, yeah, right.

872
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,799
- ( both laugh )
- Rogelio,

873
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,530
why didn't you tell me
before we slept together

874
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,504
you were once
married to my mother!

875
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:16,472
Because when you climaxed
and screamed "l love you, Papi,"

876
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:18,498
- I thought you already knew.
- You watch that?

877
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,533
Y'all gotta pay,
'cause I ain't got money for y'all.

878
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:21,909
That's just crazy.

879
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,652
You all right, baby?
Ozzy!

880
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,716
- Whoa whoa.
- Tina: Ozzy!

881
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:39,195
- We gotta go.
- What about the beer?

882
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,357
- Come on.
- You okay?

883
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:46,164
Yeah.

884
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,874
These were on sale yesterday.
You missed it.

885
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,078
I see everyone at the store is
still crazy, huh?

886
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,179
- Yeah yeah.
- ( beeps )

887
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:09,090
Look. Your old man
finally modernized.

888
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,890
This new system lets
you know how much you're wasting,

889
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,760
so you can cost
things out better.

890
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:17,096
Last week we took 3¢ off
a pound of pork chops.

891
00:42:17,134 --> 00:42:20,160
- You actually know how to use that thing?
- Not really.

892
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,900
Ozzy usually
prints it out,

893
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,738
but I want everything running
like a well-oiled machine

894
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:28,677
for when you take over.
You'll get the hang of this in no time.

895
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,906
And you've always got Ozzy.

896
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:33,041
So when do you think
you can start?

897
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:36,109
Uh, look, Dad, l--

898
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:38,383
Look, it'll help you take
your mind off things.

899
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,651
- I'm-- I'm sorry.
- No, it's...

900
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,891
You're barely home,
for Christ's sake.

901
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:56,632
You take-- you rest up.
You take your time.

902
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,638
You come to work
when you're ready.

903
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,305
Okay.

904
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,155
- Yo, Jesse, let's go hang downtown.
- What's up?

905
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:19,662
I've got a couple of rich honeys waiting
for us down there.

906
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,494
- No no, I'm cool, brother.
- Why not?

907
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,557
What you mean,
you're cool, man?

908
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,569
Come on, bro.

909
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,628
I saw the look.

910
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:29,502
What look?

911
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,405
What look?

912
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,809
Well, don't do it, okay?

913
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,813
- What?
- I know Marissa is all cool.

914
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,680
She's still fine after
all her baby-mama drama.

915
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:41,514
- Whatever.
- Come on, bro.

916
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,645
APuerto Ricanwoman--

917
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:46,315
she's never gonna forgive
that you dropped her, bro.

918
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,325
- That you dumped her like that.
- I didn't--

919
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,192
Forget that, all right?
Even if you guys were

920
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,594
to get back together,
she's gonna seem nice,

921
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,758
but she gonna make you pay
for that shit every day.

922
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,289
They're like that, bro.

923
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:58,631
You don't know what are
you talking about.

924
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,864
What do you mean?
A million years from now

925
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:04,032
aliens could come down,
they resurrect her ass.

926
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:06,508
What's the first thing
she's gonna say?

927
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,943
"Where is that
son of a bitch Jesse?"

928
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,140
No. We could
be friends, bro.

929
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,274
"We could be friends."

930
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,650
That's white people shit.

931
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,655
- All right, Johnny.
- Come on. Jesse, yo!

932
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,680
What?

933
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:23,215
( geese honking )

934
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,728
Jesse:
Marissa! Hey!

935
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,731
Jesse, what are
you doing here?

936
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,665
I remembered you used to
take this path to work.

937
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,669
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- No, I'm late for work.

938
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:34,671
- Well, we can walk and talk.
- No no no.

939
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,731
I thought that I could
do this friend thing, but I can't.

940
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:40,369
Five years together
and you break up with me in a letter.

941
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,208
You didn't even have
the guts to tell me before you left.

942
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,180
You think I knew
what the hell I wanted?

943
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,648
I was 23,
claustrophobic,

944
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,709
Mauricio and Roxanna were
off doing their thing.

945
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,879
I just needed
to get out too!

946
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,014
I thought all my life's major
questions were answered.

947
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:55,048
I had you,
I had the bodega.

948
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,652
If I was gonna make it,
I had to move on!

949
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,186
- And I knew that you did too.
- You--

950
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,027
you tore my world apart!

951
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,364
And there was nothing
that I could do about it.

952
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,699
Believe me, if I had known the way
things were gonna turn out,

953
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:09,262
- I would have never gone.
- I suppose I can't even get mad at you

954
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,503
- because you're a goddamn war hero.
- I'm not.

955
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,101
Please.

956
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,111
A guy in my unit died
because of me!

957
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,339
My buddy Lenny.

958
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,912
He was this funny kid
from Wisconsin.

959
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,888
He always wore

960
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,119
his high school basketball jersey
underneath his fatigues.

961
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,056
Anyway...

962
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,862
we had taken up position
in this abandoned house.

963
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,003
Insurgents had left
all this food behind.

964
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,474
We were hunkered
in there for the night,

965
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:20,409
so Whitey,
our squad leader,

966
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,412
said that he would treat us
to a home-cooked meal.

967
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,745
I was on lookout
at the window.

968
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:29,549
Lenny made me
switch with him.

969
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:34,451
I maybe had,
like, three bites

970
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:37,517
and some asshole launched an RPG
right through the window.

971
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,961
Lenny's--

972
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:42,488
Lenny's body was blown
back to the table.

973
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:48,634
And do you know
how I felt?

974
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,367
I was happy.

975
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,844
I-I was so happy

976
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,608
to be alive.

977
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,878
I'm so sorry, Jesse.

978
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:03,353
( sighs )
Yeah.

979
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,548
I was the lucky one.

980
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,858
Yeah.

981
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,584
His poor family.

982
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,831
Have you talked
to them?

983
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,697
No.

984
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,599
It wouldn't make
a difference.

985
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,574
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

986
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,872
He was
their only son.

987
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,984
- Mauricio: Ahem.
- ( family whispering )

988
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,424
Edy: Jesse.

989
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,932
Hey, Father Torres.
Good to see you.

990
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,436
Nice to have you home, son.
Any more soy sauce?

991
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,870
Jesse, look.
I've taken it upon myself

992
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,272
to bring Father Torres here
to talk to Mom and Dad.

993
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:00,742
- So just go with it, please. Okay?
- And where's Mom?

994
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,371
Roxanna: She went out for happy hour
with Cheryl and Gladys.

995
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,108
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

996
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:07,013
She can go if she wants.
She's a grown woman.

997
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,518
You know she's gonna
kill you, right?

998
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,282
Yeah, I'll take my chances.
Go sit down.

999
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:13,846
Okay, everybody,
just-- please.

1000
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,052
Hi, baby.

1001
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:18,789
I'm sorry I embarrassed
you this morning.

1002
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:22,026
It's okay, Mom. I just wanted to tell you
that Father Torres is here.

1003
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,090
Ay, Dios mio.
Who died?

1004
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:27,467
Nobody died, Ma.
Before you say no-- don't say no--

1005
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,972
I brought Father Torres here to talk to
you and Dad about the divorce, okay?

1006
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,907
- Please, Ma.
- No!

1007
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:34,240
You've got to think this through before
you go through with it.

1008
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,075
- Did he tell you to do this?
- No, Dad had nothing to do with it.

1009
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,808
- I'm going upstairs.
- Ma, you're not going anywhere.

1010
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,577
You're going out there
to talk to Father Torres.

1011
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,083
Do you know the mouth
on that man?

1012
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,915
The whole neighborhood's
going to know.

1013
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,614
- This is about your family.
- I didn't make any food.

1014
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,145
It doesn't matter.
Sarah ordered Chinese food.

1015
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:47,986
- She gave him takeout?
- Yes, Ma.

1016
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:50,255
Go out there.
Be brave.

1017
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:54,390
Father Torres,
so nice to see you.

1018
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,331
Do you, um...

1019
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:59,665
I could fix you some
real food if you'd like.

1020
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:02,729
Don't trouble yourself.
I'll be fine with a couple of these eggrolls

1021
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,469
and some more coquito.
Your son tells me

1022
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,602
that you and Edy are
contemplating divorce.

1023
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,942
Oh no no, Father, no.

1024
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,278
I am getting a divorce.

1025
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:15,342
See, my husband
broke his vows

1026
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,285
and sinned against God.

1027
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,084
Father, it's Christmas.
How about a little sermon

1028
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,091
about Jesus being born
so we can be forgiven for our sins?

1029
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,059
I'm not changing my mind.

1030
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,757
Now I am sorry, Father,

1031
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,097
that my son dragged you
all the way out here

1032
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:35,594
for takeout because
these women can't cook.

1033
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,766
It's the least
I can do.

1034
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,605
No wonder I don't
have a grandchild.

1035
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,975
That's what you can
do for me, Father.

1036
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,502
Can I get some more
rum for my coquito?

1037
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:46,311
Pray that I will hold

1038
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,978
- a grandchild before I'm dead.
- Here we go again.

1039
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,214
Maybe there are reasons why they're
holding back on having children.

1040
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,950
He'd rather take care of
a hedge fund than a baby.

1041
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,687
- You went crying to your mother?
- I didn't go crying.

1042
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,820
- It wasn't really crying.
- Can you blame him?

1043
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:00,887
What did you expect?

1044
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:03,798
With all this traveling
and all these hours

1045
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,803
with a hedge fund, the only sex
he'll be having is on the phone.

1046
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,896
- ( laughs )
- Oh, no no.

1047
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,873
He'll be lucky
if he gets that.

1048
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,502
You know,
the only reason

1049
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,375
that he wants a baby now

1050
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:19,007
is so that he can try
to one-up Jesse

1051
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,381
in pleasing you
and Edyberto.

1052
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,682
- What the hell's she talking about?
- That's not true, Sarah.

1053
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,813
- Yes it is.
- You take one psych course at Brandeis

1054
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,689
- and you're Sigmund Freud?
- Excuse us, Father.

1055
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:31,250
Anna, Edy, perhaps you should
think about the family.

1056
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:32,693
- We'd be fine.
- No we wouldn't be fine.

1057
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,822
You'd still have your
mommy to run home to.

1058
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,890
Look, daddy's girl,
I know for a fact I'm not the only one

1059
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,230
you call when you're
strapped for cash.

1060
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:39,895
She needed money
for head shots.

1061
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,563
You sent her money
behind my back?

1062
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,573
- Don't talk to me anymore.
- Do you see?

1063
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:46,770
Do you see the lies
that I have to put up with, Father?

1064
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:51,042
What does Roxanna need
money for a head shot for?

1065
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,572
- She's a star.
- Ma, I'm not a star.

1066
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,380
Okay?
I'm not a star. That's it.

1067
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,717
Everybody thinks I live this
glamorous life in Hollywood

1068
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:00,416
when I can barely pay
my rent on a dumpy studio

1069
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,051
and the payments
on a 1999 Kia.

1070
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,290
- What?
- God!

1071
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,423
You know what?
I just wish I could have my life

1072
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:12,264
handed to me on a silver platter
like Jesse over here.

1073
00:51:12,302 --> 00:51:14,463
- Oh, hell yeah.
- Yeah.

1074
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,768
The prodigal son returns and the rest
of us just get pushed to the side

1075
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:19,105
'cause the little prince is here.
Everything for the little prince.

1076
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:21,542
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think, Jesse.

1077
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,205
Why don't one of you come home
and take care of the bodega?

1078
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,804
Can we all
just calm down?

1079
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:27,715
Because you're off living
your own lives, right?

1080
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,548
What about my life?

1081
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:33,545
I try to get out and do l
end up in New York or LA?

1082
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,080
No, I end up in lraq.

1083
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,093
And what do I got
to show for it?

1084
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:40,221
And you think I can just
come home and run the bodega?

1085
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:43,130
- Bodegas are good businesses.
- I'm not gonna run the bodega!

1086
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,100
And that's the voice of God,
ladies and gentlemen.

1087
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,330
- Maybe we should say a prayer.
- Shut up!

1088
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,833
So what are you
gonna do?

1089
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:59,038
I'm gonna--

1090
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,683
I'm gonna go back
to lraq.

1091
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,847
I'm gonna sign up
for another tour.

1092
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:11,554
- Mijo, that's not gonna change anything.
- Maybe.

1093
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:16,860
But at least there I feel
like I have some purpose.

1094
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,130
- Jesse.
- No.

1095
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:21,194
No no no no.

1096
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:31,146
( crying )
I just wish we hadn't let him

1097
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,342
sign up
in the first place.

1098
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:36,944
There are a lot of things
I wish I hadn't done.

1099
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,387
Well, you can't take
them back now, can you?

1100
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:42,516
What's done is done.

1101
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,857
Where's Mauricio?

1102
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,193
Look, I'm sorry
about what I said.

1103
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,323
I do want
to have a baby.

1104
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,529
I just don't understand why
it has to be this second,

1105
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:55,163
when I've got this
huge opportunity.

1106
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:58,641
I'm not stupid.
I understand that I can't have it all.

1107
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,200
That at 36, my fertility

1108
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,974
is going into a freefall

1109
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,039
and that I may have
to use the eggs

1110
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:07,879
of some attractive
lvy League student

1111
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,079
who wants to get ahead
on paying off their student loans.

1112
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,556
- Look, I'd be happy to adopt.
- ( crying )

1113
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,923
But Mauricio being a Latin
doesn't feel the same way.

1114
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,819
I promise we will
have children.

1115
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,698
It may not be this second,

1116
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:27,362
but we will someday,
okay?

1117
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,969
That doesn't make you
feel any better?

1118
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:36,569
Jesse's going to sign up
for another tour in lraq.

1119
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,314
I'm so sorry.

1120
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,621
Mauricio and the kids
went down to Julio's Bar.

1121
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,630
You want me to drive
you down there?

1122
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,598
( Latin music playing )

1123
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:05,166
( singing in Spanish )

1124
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,538
This music is beautiful.

1125
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,142
Anna and l, we danced
the first time we met to this song.

1126
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,981
Mauricio was conceived
to this song.

1127
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,286
Okay, I don't think I needed
to hear all that.

1128
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,292
( groans )

1129
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,855
( horn honks )

1130
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,332
In the glove compartment,
there's medicine.

1131
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:44,142
- Which one?
- The green cap.

1132
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,648
- ( groans )
- Here.

1133
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,363
Don't tell anyone, Sarah.

1134
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:06,164
Please.

1135
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,637
Does Anna know?

1136
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:17,977
I just want to enjoy
Christmas with my family.

1137
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,983
Not that they
make it so easy.

1138
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,817
( cheering )

1139
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,626
I love you guys so much.

1140
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,963
- I love you too, Sarah.
- I do.

1141
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,492
- We love you too, baby. It's okay.
- Let's dance.

1142
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,028
- No, I don't want to--
- Get a room.

1143
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,132
Come on.
Come on.

1144
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:48,474
All right.
I don't need to be here.

1145
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,206
I think he slipped
her a hit of E.

1146
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:52,305
- Think he wants a kid that bad?
- Yeah.

1147
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,375
All you got to do is look at a Puerto Rican
girl to get her pregnant.

1148
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:57,682
- Shut up.
- Come on, come on.

1149
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:00,189
- Whoo-hoo.
- Johnny: Mira.

1150
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:02,316
This is what a real women
looks like with a burka.

1151
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,259
Right? You go, lady.
Come on, you go now.

1152
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,818
Wrap our soldier boy
over there

1153
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,523
with some red, white
and blue love.

1154
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:10,260
Your friend here says you
got shot up pretty bad.

1155
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,268
Oh, yeah yeah yeah.
They shot off his dick.

1156
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:15,362
But then they replaced
it with a bionic one

1157
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:17,669
and he could jack up a car
and change the tire

1158
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,436
at the same time.

1159
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:21,444
Really?

1160
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:24,675
( speaks Spanish )

1161
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,706
I'm just kidding.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1162
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:30,515
He's still got all his factory parts,
right, Papi?

1163
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,384
So you wanna dance?

1164
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,185
Roxanna:
Jesse, don't you dare. Jesse.

1165
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,385
- I'm-- I'm cool.
- Come on, bro.

1166
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:39,395
- Go, man, go.
- Roxanna: He's cool.

1167
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,454
You heard him,
he's cool.

1168
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:44,194
- ( dance music playing )
- Oh no.

1169
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,635
That's my song.
That's my song, y'all.

1170
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:50,138
- Yo, that's my song.
- Oh no.

1171
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:53,734
Oh, yes.
Go get 'em, Mo.

1172
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,075
( laughing )

1173
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,818
Come on.
Come on.

1174
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:09,723
Johnny:
Oh, he likes that.

1175
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:12,489
Come on, Mo.
Yeah!

1176
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:16,295
You got moves.
You go, boy, yeah!

1177
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:21,463
All:
Go Mo. Go Mo.

1178
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,305
- Oh!
- Oh!

1179
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,678
Go Mo.
Go Mo.

1180
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:38,016
Oh!

1181
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:43,988
- Ay yi yi yi yi...
- Whoo!

1182
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,956
God, it feels good
to be back.

1183
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:49,988
- Help me, Sarah.
- That was great.

1184
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:53,196
My coccyx.
I broke my coccyx.

1185
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:56,330
All I'm asking is
if a shot is $5,

1186
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,465
- how much for a sip?
- A sip?

1187
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,999
Yeah, a sip.
Just a half a shot maybe.

1188
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,672
Can you please take
that thing down?

1189
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:06,181
Why? You the biggest star
to come out of this neighborhood.

1190
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:08,207
Can I buy you a round?

1191
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:11,345
Wow. I can't believe it.
You guys are gonna pay for something?

1192
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,287
I'm only cheap
when it comes to me.

1193
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,154
- How much is her drink?
- $8.

1194
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:17,386
- What if she doesn't drink all of it?
- Never mind.

1195
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,827
Could I please have some
change for the jukebox?

1196
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,728
Thanks.

1197
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:26,695
Is there something
you want to tell me?

1198
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,704
No.

1199
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,831
- Is there something you want to tell me?
- About?

1200
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,069
Ozzy.

1201
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:36,078
Come on, you have to admit
he's really hot.

1202
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:37,704
He's a thug.

1203
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,874
No, he hasn't been messed up
in that shit for a while.

1204
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:41,247
Yeah, well, we'll see
how long that lasts.

1205
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:43,252
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

1206
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,880
Just seeing Alexis again
made me remember how bad things got.

1207
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,413
( ringtone plays )

1208
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,449
My agent.

1209
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:56,331
- They called.
- And?

1210
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,357
Roger rushed off
to his anger management class

1211
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:00,665
- and didn't say anything.
- Is that it?

1212
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,399
You told me to call
you if I heard anything.

1213
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:05,999
Well, you know, maybe they
called about something else.

1214
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,442
Or maybe they just didn't want
to ruin my Christmas.

1215
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:10,878
Please. All right look, girl,
I've got to jump.

1216
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:13,178
- I'll hit you later.
- Wait.

1217
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,343
Bye.

1218
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,684
This ain't Cali, girl. They ain't gonna arrest
you for smoking inside.

1219
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,848
I had to use the phone.

1220
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,858
- Want to go for a walk?
- No.

1221
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,416
I don't want
to leave my girl.

1222
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,951
- Oh, really?
- Really.

1223
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:29,556
Maybe we should give
'em some space.

1224
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,961
Come on, let's go.

1225
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:35,129
- Come on.
- I don't know.

1226
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:37,435
Cabby!

1227
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,581
Jesse:
Someplace a little more quiet.

1228
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,611
Come on, I just want
to talk to you.

1229
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:54,714
Hola, mi amor.

1230
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,748
Hey.

1231
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,288
- Jesse.
- Hey.

1232
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,890
Can I buy
you guys a drink?

1233
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,628
- I'm cool.
- No.

1234
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,833
Ozzy: So why did it take you
three years to come back?

1235
01:00:11,874 --> 01:00:14,741
God, I've just been
crazy busy, you know?

1236
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,473
If it's not one thing,
it's something else.

1237
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:20,949
Shit, who am I kidding?

1238
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:23,646
I'm sure
you've heard everything.

1239
01:00:23,686 --> 01:00:26,120
You'll catch a break.
You just--

1240
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:27,679
you just got
to hang in there.

1241
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:29,351
Caught a break.

1242
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:32,088
What if I'm waiting
on something that never happens?

1243
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,652
How much more time
should I waste?

1244
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,823
A year?
Two? 10?

1245
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:39,801
Stuck in the same place while everybody
else's life is moving forward.

1246
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:41,599
So what are you gonna do?
Move back?

1247
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,606
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.

1248
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,699
That wouldn't be
the worst thing, right?

1249
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:51,044
I never thought I'd hear
that coming from you.

1250
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,947
I'm 29 years old

1251
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,645
and I'm sick and tired of someone else
deciding my fate

1252
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:59,951
when I'm just as good
if not better

1253
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,684
than most of the actresses
out there.

1254
01:01:01,724 --> 01:01:04,022
- They don't know me.
- You are good.

1255
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:07,052
Like that time that you played
that homeless chick in "One Way Ticket."

1256
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:09,155
- You saw that?
- Are you kidding?

1257
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,393
You killed it.
You're like the Puerto Rican Meryl Streep.

1258
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,958
Yeah, right.

1259
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,630
Your parents made us watch
the DVD like five times.

1260
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,765
- Of course they did.
- Yeah.

1261
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:23,207
Look, don't tell
anybody what I said.

1262
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:26,409
All right?
I'm all over the place right now.

1263
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,082
I'll think about it.

1264
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:34,080
You'll think about it?

1265
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:37,058
- Don't make me kick your ass.
- You got to catch me.

1266
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:38,890
- Kick my ass.
- Don't make--

1267
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:41,863
- Kick my ass. What?
- I will kick your ass.

1268
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:45,334
Why are you running?
Why are you running?

1269
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:07,783
We didn't use protection.

1270
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:11,419
Nope. You said you wanted
to make a baby.

1271
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:13,588
I was completely loaded.

1272
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:15,722
In vino veritas.

1273
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:17,699
Oh, really?
Oh, really?

1274
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,134
And I probably told the bartender
he looked like George Clooney.

1275
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:22,364
Mm-hmm.
Among other things.

1276
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,600
What's the date?
What's the date?

1277
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,801
What is the date?

1278
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:29,107
It's Christmas Eve,
December 24th.

1279
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:32,444
Okay, that public library
event, I had my period.

1280
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,473
- What are you doing?
- That's 19 days.

1281
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:36,712
Okay, I'm okay.
We're okay.

1282
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,984
I think we're okay.
I hope we're okay.

1283
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:42,752
Mauricio, how could you take
advantage of me like that?

1284
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,282
I didn't take
advantage of you.

1285
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:46,318
- You took advantage of me.
- Oh!

1286
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,489
You don't want to make
a baby anymore?

1287
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:50,624
Oh, well, I just think
it's something

1288
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:53,157
that we should be discussing
while I'm sober.

1289
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:55,261
Okay, all right, all right.
You're sober now.

1290
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:57,272
Let's discuss this.

1291
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,501
Do you or don't you want
to make a baby with me?

1292
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:02,010
I don't--
I don't want to talk about this.

1293
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:04,308
I feel like shit.

1294
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:06,315
Oh my God.

1295
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:08,840
The colors in this room
are inducing a migraine.

1296
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,319
Does that mean we're not
gonna try again?

1297
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:13,822
Oh, eat me.

1298
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,823
Don't even
think about it.

1299
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,522
- ( Latin music playing )
- ( people celebrating )

1300
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:27,328
Woman:
Merry Christmas, everyone.

1301
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,432
Oh, you got moves.

1302
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:34,238
No bad.
Now you spin.

1303
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,906
Coquito, ladies?

1304
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,447
Ozzy.

1305
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,822
Ozzy, gracia, amigo.

1306
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,850
Thank you, Edy.

1307
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,664
- Uli, Uli. Feliz Navidad.
- Thank you.

1308
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:59,895
- Tina.
- ( phone rings )

1309
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:03,201
Hello? Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

1310
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,230
- Come on, baby.
- No.

1311
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,174
- Coquito?
- Oh no.

1312
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:09,235
- You think I don't know?
- Know what?

1313
01:04:09,278 --> 01:04:11,838
That every year your father gets me drunk
at the Christmas party

1314
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,213
so I don't notice
how light my envelope is.

1315
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:17,583
- Come on.
- Huh-uh, not gonna have any of that stuff

1316
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:20,214
until I see the size
of my Christmas bonus.

1317
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:22,247
All right.
Okay.

1318
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,054
Not gonna trick me again.

1319
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,066
Dad.

1320
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:39,199
The rest of the checks.

1321
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:41,733
- Yeah, I got it.
- All right.

1322
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:43,244
Go. You go.

1323
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:44,871
Go hang out with
Johnny or something.

1324
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:46,541
Don't feel like you've got
to stick around here.

1325
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:49,551
Dad, look, I know you're not
happy about me going back.

1326
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:51,883
Of course I'm not.

1327
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:57,089
Jesse, I'm your father.
I want you safe.

1328
01:04:57,126 --> 01:04:58,923
I want you here.

1329
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:03,560
I'm sorry.

1330
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,033
How can I make
you understand?

1331
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:09,299
You can't.
Just like I can't make you stay.

1332
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:17,640
There's a point when all a father can do
is just get out of the way.

1333
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:24,282
Thanks, Dad.

1334
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:34,925
I'd better give
Tina her check.

1335
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:36,488
Otherwise she's gonna
start the revolution.

1336
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:41,599
Any word?

1337
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:43,764
No, I'm just texting
my girl.

1338
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:45,330
What are you telling her?

1339
01:05:45,374 --> 01:05:47,604
How much you had last night
in the fine city of Chicago?

1340
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:51,238
No, I'm telling her how
freaking freezing it is here.

1341
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,612
Cali had made you
all soft, girl.

1342
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:56,413
You move back here,
you'll be wearing hot pants in this weather.

1343
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:59,012
Yeah, well, hopefully
I'll get this show.

1344
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:00,920
Yeah, I hope so.

1345
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,118
Hey, I had a really
good time last night.

1346
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:05,684
- Great time last night.
- Me too.

1347
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:07,320
Really good time.

1348
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:09,126
But I just don't want you
to get the wrong impression.

1349
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:13,033
Nah, come on.
You're like a sister to me.

1350
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:14,798
Yeah, that's what I told
Jesse this morning.

1351
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:17,305
That you're like a brother
and it's just weird.

1352
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,171
Don't even worry about it.

1353
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,870
- I'm gonna grab a drink.
- Okay.

1354
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:24,072
I'll see you later?

1355
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:28,009
Okay.

1356
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:32,783
( singing in Spanish )

1357
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,882
( Sarah singing in Spanish )

1358
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,896
( laughs )
Mira eso.

1359
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,797
Sarah, you've been practicing
for the parranda.

1360
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:47,064
I'm trying. I didn't exactly grow up
singing Christmas carols.

1361
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:49,469
No, you're doing great.

1362
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,632
I can't tell you
what this means to me.

1363
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:54,734
I look forward to
the parranda all year.

1364
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:57,302
You must be
looking for this.

1365
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:59,507
Thank you.

1366
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:03,211
Listen, thank you
for keeping my secret.

1367
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,345
Look, Edyberto,

1368
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:08,380
I really appreciate
your trust in me.

1369
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:11,723
Who else can I trust? You're the only one
who's not Puerto Rican in this house.

1370
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:14,730
But I really think
you need to tell them.

1371
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:17,062
I'll tell them soon enough.

1372
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:19,590
Life is short, Sarah.

1373
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:22,604
I don't want anything to get in the way
of them having a good time.

1374
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:25,232
- You understand?
- Pop, where are the mitten warmers?

1375
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,003
Yeah, coming.

1376
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,034
No no no no no.

1377
01:07:29,078 --> 01:07:31,569
- Keep practicing.
- Mm-hmm.

1378
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:34,082
( both singing in Spanish )

1379
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,519
- ( doorbell ringing )
- Anna: Guys, come on. Hurry up.

1380
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:44,185
Vamos pa' la parranda.

1381
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,592
Here we go.
Here we go.

1382
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,532
Anna, Roxanna,
vámonos.

1383
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:53,091
( all talking )

1384
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:59,974
- There they go.
- # The first noel... #

1385
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:04,969
- Merry Christmas.
- # The angels did say #

1386
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:09,974
# Was to certain
poor shepherds #

1387
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:14,581
# In fields
where they lay #

1388
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:19,083
- # Noel, noel... #
- La parranda!

1389
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:24,964
# Noel, noel #

1390
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,800
# Born isthe king #

1391
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,671
# Of lsrael. #

1392
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:35,074
( cheers )

1393
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:40,139
# Come all ye faithful #

1394
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:44,676
# Joyful and triumphant #

1395
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,154
# O come ye #

1396
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:49,817
# O come ye #

1397
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:54,455
#To Bethlehem#

1398
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:59,366
#Come and behold him#

1399
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:03,838
# Born the king
of angels #

1400
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:08,708
# O come let us

1401
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:13,238
# O come
let us adore him... #

1402
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,516
Ozzy, come on.

1403
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:22,285
Come on.

1404
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:23,814
They're over here.
Give me the baby.

1405
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,292
- Come on.
- They're right there.

1406
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:30,697
# O come
all ye faithful #

1407
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:35,170
# Joyful and triumphant #

1408
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:40,471
# O come

1409
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:44,843
# Joyful and triumphant #

1410
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:50,079
# O come all ye faithful #

1411
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:54,112
# Joyful and triumphant... #

1412
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:03,598
( church bell tolling )

1413
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:23,917
# Joyful and triumphant. #

1414
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:27,286
( cheering )

1415
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:34,697
( Latin music playing )

1416
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,460
( Latin music playing )

1417
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:32,887
- Have you seen your brother?
- Yeah, he's over there.

1418
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,789
Why aren't
you two dancing?

1419
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:39,316
And compete with them?

1420
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:47,634
Excuse me.

1421
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:50,138
Where did you get these earrings?
I want to get a pair for Gladys.

1422
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:52,367
- They're beautiful.
- Okay, you know the--

1423
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:54,638
What's going on?

1424
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:57,271
We're going
to midnight mass.

1425
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,714
Hey, Edy.
I see you've met my new novio.

1426
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:02,717
Tony.

1427
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:04,810
A pleasure.

1428
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:06,946
- You coming to church?
- Please.

1429
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:10,015
He hasn't been to midnight
mass in over 20 years.

1430
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,323
- I'd love to come.
- Great.

1431
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:14,420
Vámonos.

1432
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,533
Roxanna.
Roxanna.

1433
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:22,093
- Bye, Ma.
- Bye.

1434
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:30,307
Yo, say thanks, baby.

1435
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,576
Come on, Rox.
What you got, baby?

1436
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:00,135
So you still got
some moves, huh?

1437
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,505
Depends on who
my partner is.

1438
01:13:03,545 --> 01:13:05,206
( chuckles )

1439
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:08,273
I'm sure you say that to
all the boys on the base.

1440
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:15,720
- Stay away from my girl.
- We were just dancing.

1441
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,228
Go get Ozzy.
Go get Ozzy.

1442
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:22,560
Hey hey hey!

1443
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:25,123
- You seen Ozzy?
- No, Mama, I ain't seen him.

1444
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,431
Oh shit!

1445
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,032
Ma.

1446
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,905
You got to pick up
the pace, Ma.

1447
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:36,137
I'm trying.
You got to be patient.

1448
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,942
I can't wait for the sopadito
you're gonna cook for me upstairs.

1449
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:41,643
We can have a party, you and me.
After all, it's Christmas.

1450
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:44,277
You should apply
at the post office.

1451
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:46,651
They hire extra people
at the holidays.

1452
01:13:46,688 --> 01:13:49,418
No, I will.
I'll do that on Monday. Okay, Mom?

1453
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:52,484
I hope so.

1454
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:54,826
Oh, merry Christmas.

1455
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:56,831
Hey, Ma, you go
inside, okay?

1456
01:13:56,865 --> 01:13:58,958
Start that sopadito.
I got to talk to my boy here.

1457
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:00,628
You sure?
You want to come in now?

1458
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:03,103
No no, he's busy.
He's a busy guy.

1459
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:05,333
( speaking Spanish )

1460
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:15,612
Can't let you kill me
in front of my mom, man.

1461
01:14:18,554 --> 01:14:19,680
So you know why I'm here?

1462
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:23,588
I guess it's payback time.

1463
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:24,990
I'm ready, man.

1464
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:27,291
I had 10 years
to be ready.

1465
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,957
Let's go.

1466
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,035
He was like a father
and mother to me.

1467
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:47,674
It was either him or me, man.
It could have gone either way.

1468
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:49,650
He was all I had.

1469
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:52,381
I got nothing.

1470
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:55,015
I got nothing!

1471
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:57,389
Do what you got
to do, brother.

1472
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:15,902
( phone ringing )

1473
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:41,896
Come on.

1474
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,701
- That you calling?
- Yeah, what the hell?

1475
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:50,234
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1476
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,471
( splashes )

1477
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:24,806
- You must be cold.
- I'm fine.

1478
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:45,493
( radio playing )

1479
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:59,010
( turns radio off )

1480
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:01,277
How could you do it?

1481
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:03,682
Anna, you're the only woman
I've ever loved.

1482
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:07,712
And Suzy Lee?
You think I don't know her name?

1483
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:15,456
There'll be plenty of time to discuss this
after the holidays.

1484
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:19,297
I just want us
to enjoy the kids.

1485
01:17:19,334 --> 01:17:22,132
Enjoy Christmas.

1486
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:29,541
Afterthe kidsaregone,

1487
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:33,378
you and I have nothing
left to say to each other.

1488
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:00,970
( door opens )

1489
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,840
Jesse:
You can't focus.

1490
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:04,971
Mauricio:
I got this.

1491
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:05,313
- A little of this.
- You're gonna get caught.

1492
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:08,009
- A little of this.
- You're gonna get caught.

1493
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:10,678
You'd better be careful.
Oh oh, oh-oh.

1494
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,812
What's going on?
Heard you got into a fight with Fernando.

1495
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:15,880
- Yeah yeah yeah.
- Fess up.

1496
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:18,484
Well, when you love a woman you've got
to do anything for her, right?

1497
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:20,518
I guess so.

1498
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:22,223
Mauricio knows what
I'm talking about.

1499
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:25,097
Never lose
that feeling, mijo.

1500
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:28,368
You know how I got this?

1501
01:18:28,403 --> 01:18:29,893
Let me take a wild guess.

1502
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:32,668
Yeah, why don't you just
take a stab in the dark?

1503
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:35,939
Wrestling Manuel Santos
on the pier at Ponce.

1504
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:39,208
- He was the featherweight...
-...champion of the world.

1505
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:42,739
You laugh, you laugh.
The point is I never let him steal my girl.

1506
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:45,275
- Never let him steal my girl.
- I'm proud of you.

1507
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:51,524
Now I can't even
take down a goddamn tree

1508
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,585
to give your mother a view.

1509
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:56,722
We should just go out
there ourselves and take that tree down.

1510
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:59,393
Let's go take
that tree down now.

1511
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:01,231
Great idea.
Let's do it, Pop.

1512
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:02,634
I've got some chains
in the basement.

1513
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:05,037
Wrap them around,
tie them up to the car.

1514
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:07,473
- Come on.
- Come on, get up.

1515
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:11,938
( whistles )

1516
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:14,107
You good?
All right, Pop.

1517
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:16,549
- We're all good.
- Let me know when it's tight.

1518
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,553
- Okay.
- Pedal to the metal. Come on.

1519
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,646
Go go go go.

1520
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:24,147
Go go go go.
Hey hey hey!

1521
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:27,457
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Stop stop.

1522
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:30,056
What are you doing?

1523
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,157
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

1524
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,760
- Sure you don't want me to drive?
- No, I got it.

1525
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:37,966
I can't wait to see your mother's face
in the morning when she sees this.

1526
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:40,975
- Mom's gonna freak.
- ( laughing )

1527
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:43,842
( tires squealing )

1528
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:47,178
Jesse:
Keep going. Go go go.

1529
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:50,150
- That's it, that's it.
- Come on, Pop.

1530
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:52,119
- Keep going.
- A little more.

1531
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:54,987
- You got nothing, man.
- Come on, Dad.

1532
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:57,753
You're looking good.
Go!

1533
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:01,160
- Go go go go!
- Go!

1534
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:10,503
- ( grunts )
- Dad! Dad!

1535
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:13,030
You could've been killed.
What were you thinking?

1536
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:15,099
You wanted a view.
I was gonna give you a view.

1537
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:16,838
Sorry, Mom, I shouldn't
have helped him.

1538
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:18,846
I helped too. You got to take blame
for everything as well?

1539
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,609
Don't listen to them.
I would've done it without them.

1540
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:22,139
And I still will.
You watch me.

1541
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:24,345
You better make sure you
get his head checked.

1542
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:26,718
This is his medicine.

1543
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:29,189
They might need this.

1544
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:54,507
( siren wails )

1545
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:13,028
Ma!
( speaks Spanish )

1546
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:15,730
- What happened?
- Is Dad okay?

1547
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,900
Sit down.
All of you, please.

1548
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,572
He didn't seem that
banged up, Mom, come on.

1549
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:27,877
What is it?
Just say it.

1550
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:29,315
I hate when you do this.
Just say it.

1551
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:33,580
Your father has cancer.

1552
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:39,623
What?

1553
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:43,954
And here I was
going to leave him.

1554
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:54,934
God's punishing me.

1555
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:00,941
- They called his doctor in.
- Doctor?

1556
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:04,812
So he knew?

1557
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:10,754
How did he
keep this from us?

1558
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:13,955
I don't know.

1559
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:15,758
Me.

1560
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:25,265
Hey, Uncle Edy, that tree looked a whole
lot worse than you did.

1561
01:22:25,307 --> 01:22:27,639
But it didn't go down,
so you better not go down.

1562
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:33,075
- Oh, hi, Suzy Lee.
- Hey, Edy.

1563
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:36,277
I'm Dr. Lee,
your dad's oncologist.

1564
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:38,183
It's nice to finally
meet you all.

1565
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:40,414
He's told me so many
great things about you.

1566
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,480
We just want to know
the prognosis.

1567
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:46,255
- Has he metastasized?
- Has he started chemo?

1568
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:49,786
I know you've got a million questions
and I am more than happy to answer them.

1569
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:52,857
I think your dad
needs some rest.

1570
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:55,597
Why don't we meet
down in the cafeteria in about 20 minutes?

1571
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,628
I'm Anna,
his wife.

1572
01:22:57,672 --> 01:22:59,503
Of course, Anna.
It's good to meet you.

1573
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:01,532
- We'll talk in a few minutes.
- Okay.

1574
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:06,779
Roxanna:
She seems nice.

1575
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,874
She's a gynecologist?

1576
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:11,477
- Johnny.
- I'm just kidding. Come on.

1577
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:17,355
Give me a few moments
with your mother.

1578
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:19,519
Yeah.

1579
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:25,324
Hey, let's go.

1580
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:28,866
Papi!

1581
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:30,632
Ay, mijo.

1582
01:23:30,672 --> 01:23:32,663
It's okay.
It's okay.

1583
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:39,207
It's okay.
Go on.

1584
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:49,082
Mi amor.

1585
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:57,860
Estúpido.

1586
01:23:57,899 --> 01:24:00,459
Why didn't you tell me?

1587
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:05,531
I wanted us to enjoy
the time we have.

1588
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:11,505
( groans )

1589
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,946
How do you think
it's enjoyable

1590
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:16,951
for me to think
you're with another woman?

1591
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:19,351
I'm sorry.

1592
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:22,686
But when you started going
on about the divorce,

1593
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,488
I thought, maybe this
is a good thing.

1594
01:24:27,295 --> 01:24:28,922
Maybe this way
she'll know

1595
01:24:28,963 --> 01:24:31,431
that she can be happy
when I'm not around.

1596
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:34,060
You silly man.

1597
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:37,671
What am I going
to do with you?

1598
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:51,078
How could you not tell me, Sarah?
You didn't tell me.

1599
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:53,610
When are you going to trust
in the fact that I love you?

1600
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:56,920
Your dad loves you,
Mauricio.

1601
01:24:56,958 --> 01:25:00,121
Just because I love my job
doesn't mean I love you less.

1602
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:02,994
You'll see that when
we have kids of our own.

1603
01:25:03,031 --> 01:25:04,965
Don't worry about
the kid thing.

1604
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:07,866
I'm getting used to the idea
of not having kids anyway.

1605
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:12,796
I want to start trying
right away.

1606
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:17,807
Life is short, right?

1607
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:20,781
- Yeah.
- Let's just do it.

1608
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:23,545
Wow, when are you
gonna turn the job down?

1609
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:27,489
I'm still gonna
take the job.

1610
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:37,463
- Wow, not even a dent.
- Yeah.

1611
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:48,298
To make the pernil taste great
you've got to puncture it like this.

1612
01:25:48,343 --> 01:25:50,709
And then you put
the garlic cloves in it.

1613
01:25:50,745 --> 01:25:53,145
Okay, now the pasteles,
you need to--

1614
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:56,116
We got it, Mami.
Now go back to the hospital.

1615
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:58,449
- Please.
- ( ringtone chiming )

1616
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:00,886
- Is that your agent?
- Yeah.

1617
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:03,948
Ay, Diosito.
Let it be good news.

1618
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,290
- We need good news today.
- Amen.

1619
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:08,955
Hey, Sarah.

1620
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,830
Um, I'll really glad
you're here.

1621
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:32,213
Hey.

1622
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:34,187
How you holding up?

1623
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:37,020
God, if I see any more
sofrito, I think I'll scream.

1624
01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:39,185
I don't know
how my mom does it.

1625
01:26:39,227 --> 01:26:41,422
I heard you didn't
get the part.

1626
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:46,265
No, I got the part.
I just didn't take it.

1627
01:26:46,301 --> 01:26:47,734
What?

1628
01:26:47,769 --> 01:26:49,760
It was for the seventh
lead on a TV show

1629
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:52,773
that'll probably be off
the air after three episodes anyway.

1630
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:54,502
It wasn't all that.

1631
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:56,908
Yeah, it was.

1632
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:59,413
I can't say
I'm mad at you.

1633
01:26:59,447 --> 01:27:02,041
- You better not be.
- I'm not.

1634
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:17,787
Well well well.

1635
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:20,801
- What do we got here?
- Get a life, Jesse.

1636
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:23,326
- Shut up, man.
- Oh yeah.

1637
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:32,572
( doorbell rings )

1638
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:36,446
- Hey.
- Hey.

1639
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:40,381
Fernando here?

1640
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:42,446
He's at his cousin's house.

1641
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:44,458
He's gonna be by soon

1642
01:27:44,492 --> 01:27:46,722
and you know he's not gonna
be happy if he finds you here.

1643
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:49,628
My mom just wanted me to
bring this by for Hector.

1644
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:53,293
You really didn't
have to do that.

1645
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:55,495
- Ooh, a truck.
- Oh, yeah.

1646
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:58,004
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1647
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:09,742
I know things got messed
up with the fight,

1648
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:13,481
but I was hoping you'd still
come by the house.

1649
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:16,115
- We're going to Fernando's parent's place.
- Oh.

1650
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:23,629
I'm looking at you

1651
01:28:23,665 --> 01:28:26,862
and I realize the one thing
I haven't said is...

1652
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:29,369
I'm sorry.

1653
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,899
I'm sorry, Marissa.

1654
01:28:37,078 --> 01:28:39,308
Look, Jesse,

1655
01:28:39,347 --> 01:28:41,645
it's like when we--

1656
01:28:41,683 --> 01:28:44,447
when we fall in love,

1657
01:28:44,485 --> 01:28:47,147
we take a chance
that we might get hurt.

1658
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:50,150
But we choose
to do it anyway.

1659
01:28:50,191 --> 01:28:52,659
And it's just like
with you and Lenny.

1660
01:28:52,694 --> 01:28:55,492
When he switched
watch with you,

1661
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,327
he knew that he
was taking a risk.

1662
01:28:57,365 --> 01:28:59,560
Then he took your place

1663
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,397
and you're still here.

1664
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:05,698
He gave you
a second chance.

1665
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:08,004
( phone ringing )

1666
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:10,033
Why would you want
to throw that away?

1667
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:20,046
Hello?
Hey.

1668
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:22,852
Can you pick up
some milk?

1669
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:25,017
Thanks.

1670
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:30,859
Yeah.

1671
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:41,766
I'm glad you found somebody
to make you happy.

1672
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:45,938
I just wish
it could've been me.

1673
01:29:52,053 --> 01:29:54,385
You should probably go.

1674
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:56,390
Yeah.

1675
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:04,421
Goodbye, Marissa.

1676
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,431
Goodbye.

1677
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:16,593
Uh...

1678
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,696
hello.

1679
01:31:20,174 --> 01:31:22,608
Mrs. Brewer?

1680
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:24,770
Hi, it's Jesse.

1681
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:27,747
I'm Lenny's friend.

1682
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:43,125
Mauricio: You like these?
Mom, how'd you know my size?

1683
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:44,893
Anna:
It's real comfortable too.

1684
01:31:44,932 --> 01:31:46,365
I used to be small.
Now it's extra large.

1685
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,231
What is this?

1686
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:50,999
Oh, looks big.
Looks big.

1687
01:31:51,038 --> 01:31:54,064
- Oooh.
- Oh.

1688
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:56,838
Achristening gown.

1689
01:31:56,878 --> 01:31:59,142
Mauricio told me
about your plans.

1690
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,171
Yeah, um--

1691
01:32:01,215 --> 01:32:03,376
we've never really talked
about baptism.

1692
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:04,884
No we didn't.
No we didn't.

1693
01:32:04,919 --> 01:32:06,887
But we're not gonna
bar mitzvah the kid.

1694
01:32:06,921 --> 01:32:09,048
Come on, who ever heard
of a Puerto Rican Jew?

1695
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:11,820
- Geraldo Rivera.
- Juan Epstein.

1696
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:13,759
That's a television character.
Stay out of it, thank you.

1697
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:16,695
Actually, in San Juan
there are a lot of Puerto Rican Jews.

1698
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:18,892
- Oh, Ma.
- ( car horn playing tune )

1699
01:32:18,933 --> 01:32:20,594
That's Johnny.

1700
01:32:20,635 --> 01:32:23,001
That necklace that Edy
gave you is so beautiful.

1701
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:25,562
- That's not all she's getting.
- Roxanna: Dad!

1702
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:29,167
I meant the tree.
You said you wanted a view.

1703
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:31,610
I'm gonna call those guys
back after the holidays and take it down.

1704
01:32:31,646 --> 01:32:33,841
Huh-uh.
It's old,

1705
01:32:33,881 --> 01:32:36,008
it's ugly,
but it's my tree.

1706
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:38,177
And I love it.

1707
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:40,016
Who needs a view anyway?

1708
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:41,783
Whatever you wish.

1709
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:43,255
Uncle Edy,
Uncle Edy.

1710
01:32:43,291 --> 01:32:47,591
Oh, look what fell
off the truck.

1711
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:51,792
We got a brand new and improved
situation going on here for you.

1712
01:32:51,832 --> 01:32:54,460
There it is,
brand new and improved.

1713
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:56,732
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

1714
01:32:56,771 --> 01:32:58,898
- Yeah!
- Ma, what is this?

1715
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:01,431
That's for your dad.
Put it away.

1716
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:03,568
- Smell 'em.
- No!

1717
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:05,602
Did you regift?
You regifted.

1718
01:33:05,646 --> 01:33:07,978
Anna:
Thank you so much, Johnny.

1719
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:10,245
- ( Latin music playing )
- ( cheering )

1720
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:17,857
Come on.
Come on, dance with me.

1721
01:33:45,152 --> 01:33:48,349
When it's cold you've got
to jiggle the key a couple of times.

1722
01:33:48,389 --> 01:33:50,254
'Cause sometimes
the lock sticks.

1723
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:52,156
I got it, Pop.
I got it.

1724
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:54,161
- I know you do.
- ( lock clicks )

1725
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:56,527
( laughs )

1726
01:35:20,981 --> 01:35:24,747
( hip-hop music playing )

1727
01:35:24,785 --> 01:35:26,912
# It's another one
of them bangers #

1728
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:29,684
# This one's dedicated
to the family #

1729
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:31,248
# We love you #

1730
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:33,283

# We stick together
when times are calling #

1736
01:35:45,806 --> 01:35:47,899
# Es una pandilla #

1737
01:35:47,942 --> 01:35:50,706
# Where the only weapons
are weapons for loving #

#Mifamilia#

1739
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:55,642
# We come together
when the game gets tough #

1740
01:35:55,683 --> 01:35:58,049
# Come on,
come on, that's enough #

1741
01:35:58,085 --> 01:36:00,553
# There ain't no way
you can mess with us #

1742
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:02,818
# And God knows
I ain't perfect #

1743
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:05,382
# But when it comes down to
my fam, I know it's worth it #

1744
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:07,394
# They'll say he did it
on purpose #

1745
01:36:07,428 --> 01:36:09,589
# Became something though you
thought I was worthless #

1746
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:11,791
# Jesus Christ,
he's so nice #

1747
01:36:11,832 --> 01:36:14,164
# Blame it on the beans and rice,
weeds and pipes #

1748
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:16,761
# Should have been
deported twice whether wrong or right #

1749
01:36:16,804 --> 01:36:19,671
# The illest realest Spanish rap
you ever heard in your life #

1750
01:36:19,707 --> 01:36:22,608
# It's mi familia regaeton
with a live band #

1751
01:36:22,643 --> 01:36:25,009
# Born in America, why we don't
feel like it's our land #

1752
01:36:25,045 --> 01:36:27,138
# At times, man,
I sit back and wonder #

1753
01:36:27,181 --> 01:36:29,581
# Is the belly of the beast
gonna take us under? #

1754
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:32,085
# Through the lightening
and thunder living la vida loca #

1755
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:34,519
# Oops, sorry, meant loco,
I bet you still get the point though #

1756
01:36:34,555 --> 01:36:36,989
# We went cuckoo for cocoa,
all we wanted was more dough #
