1
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:37,086
Ball one to Johnny Damon
and we are under way.

2
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:39,171
Damon has eight hits
in 18 at bats,

3
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:41,841
a double, a triple,
a couple of stolen bases.

4
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,135
He had four hits
in the series opener.

5
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:47,013
Strike.

6
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,611
Down the right-field line,
fair off the bat of Damon.

7
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:04,697
It rolls by Spencer.

8
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:08,492
And Damon will coast into
second base with a leadoff double.

9
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,792
Into right-center field, broken bat,
it'll fall, a base hit.

10
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:18,919
They wave around Damon.
He will score.

11
00:01:18,919 --> 00:01:21,380
And Jason Giambi delivers

12
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,508
with a run-scoring single
here in the opening inning.

13
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:27,219
And the Athletics
have taken that 1 -nothing lead.

14
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:29,305
Go, come on, now. We gotta spin it.

15
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,731
Let's go, Yankees!

16
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,631
Let's go, Yankees!

17
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:48,199
Bases loaded.

18
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:52,411
The Yankees have the tying run
at second, down 2-nothing.

19
00:01:57,542 --> 00:02:00,711
The A's are kicking it and throwing it
all over the field.

20
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:04,924
And it might lead to their elimination
if they don't get it right in a hurry.

21
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:08,761
Hammered down the right-field line.
Justice!

22
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:11,639
The Yankees have taken the lead.

23
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:20,272
They're standing,
anticipating another trip

24
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:23,609
to the League
Championship Series.

25
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:26,070
The Yankees one out away.

26
00:02:27,572 --> 00:02:32,118
Eric Byrnes, never with an
at bat in Yankee Stadium,

27
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,954
and they don't get
much bigger than this one.

28
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:38,708
Or more hectic when you're
up there trying to get a job done.

29
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,153
And they're roaring in the Bronx.

30
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:13,409
Losing the first two games at home
in the best-of-five series

31
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,494
and roar back to--

32
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,308
The Yankees will defend their title.

33
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:58,245
It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on.

34
00:03:58,245 --> 00:04:01,165
I don't need to watch.
Joe, leave it on.

35
00:04:01,165 --> 00:04:02,374
Okay.

36
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:17,056
and didn't like the taste
of champagne.

37
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:19,767
Better ask to get traded.

38
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:23,354
You gotta give the Yankees--

39
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:25,147
--win the big game.

40
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:29,109
What a series that is
gonna be in the next...

41
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:39,203
You know how many kids
are wearing Giambi's--?

42
00:04:39,203 --> 00:04:42,957
You know, Oakland Giambi's jerseys
and hats and pictures and posters?

43
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:46,585
Those same kids will be booing in
July when the Yankees come here.

44
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:51,006
Is it Giambi that's stabbing the back
or the Pinstripes on the East Coast?

45
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:53,717
You can't blame them
for pilfering the henhouse.

46
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:56,136
The henhouse is there.
I can't blame them?

47
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:59,598
They're offering $120 million
oÎ½er six years.

48
00:04:59,598 --> 00:05:03,435
The Yankees have deeper pockets and
they're willing to give him money.

49
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:05,229
They're pilfering our players.

50
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:08,774
It's like we're a farm system
for the New York Yankees.

51
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:17,074
How are the guys doing?
That was a killer.

52
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:20,202
That was a killer.
It's a tough one to swallow. It's...

53
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:22,955
They played great.
They played their hearts out.

54
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:26,375
They did. They played fantastic.
It just didn't fall our way.

55
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,461
You'll do better next year.
But we were close, though.

56
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:31,672
We were so close.
Right there.

57
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:34,258
Almost had it. You gotta
feel good about that.

58
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:37,636
I feel great about it.
I feel great about it.

59
00:05:40,682 --> 00:05:42,141
Um...

60
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:44,685
We're not gonna do better
next year.

61
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:47,771
Why not?
Well, you know we're being gutted.

62
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:52,902
We're losing Giambi,
Damon, Isringhausen.

63
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:55,654
Done deal.
We're in trouble.

64
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:59,742
You'll find new guys.
You found Jason, you found Damon.

65
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:01,410
I need more money, Steve.
Billy.

66
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,746
I need more money.
We don't have any.

67
00:06:03,746 --> 00:06:06,498
I can't compete against $120 million
with $38 million.

68
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:10,002
We're not gonna compete with
these teams that have big budgets.

69
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:12,838
We're gonna work
within the constraints we have,

70
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:16,759
and you're gonna do the best job
that you can recruiting new players.

71
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,178
We're not gonna pay $17 million
to players.

72
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,555
I'm not asking you

73
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,516
for 10 or 20, 30 million dollars.

74
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:26,477
I'm just asking for a bit of help.

75
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:30,314
Get me a little closer and I will
get you that championship team.

76
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:34,735
I mean, this is why I'm here.
This is why you hired me.

77
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:38,739
And I gotta ask you,
what are we doing here

78
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:41,533
Billy, I--
if it's not to win a championship?

79
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:45,120
I wanna win just as much--
That's my bar. My bar is here.

80
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:48,207
My bar is to take this team
to the championship.

81
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:53,170
Billy, we're a small-market team,
and you're a small-market .

82
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:58,217
I'm asking you to be okay not
spending money that I don't have.

83
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:00,886
And I'm asking you
to take a deep breath,

84
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:04,556
shake off the loss, get back
in a room with your guys,

85
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:08,268
and figure out how to find
replacements for the guys we lost

86
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:10,354
with the money that we do have.

87
00:07:10,354 --> 00:07:15,859
I'm not leaving here. I'm not--
I can't leave here with that.

88
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,071
What else can I help you with?

89
00:07:32,794 --> 00:07:34,461
I need another day.

90
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:37,423
His mind's pretty made up.
I just think you should know that.

91
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,885
I got a call. I'll get you back.
I'll let him know.

92
00:07:41,885 --> 00:07:42,885
Bye.

93
00:07:44,806 --> 00:07:46,640
Yeah?
Billy, Scott.

94
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,226
Just got off the phone with Dan.
You didn't.

95
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:50,936
I was surprised he called me.

96
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:54,273
Stop. I got Johnny for 7.5
or he doesn't play anywhere else.

97
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:59,236
That's the deal you made.
Boston just upped it to 7.75.

98
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,614
You there?

99
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:08,203
We had a deal, Scott.
We have a deal, if it's 8 million.

100
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:11,623
Oh, man, you played me.
I'm just doing my job for my client.

101
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:14,460
No, you're playing me,
and you're still playing me.

102
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,212
Congratulations, asshole.
You win.

103
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:27,264
I like guys that got
a little hair on their ass.

104
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:30,225
He looks like a Mantle
or a Mays, quite frankly.

105
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:33,145
He's got a baseball body.
Matty, who do you got?

106
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,314
I like Geronimo.
Yes.

107
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:41,111
Top of my list.
Clean-cut, good face.

108
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:42,988
Yeah, good jaw.
Five-tools guy.

109
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:45,115
Good-looking ballplayer.
Can he hit?

110
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:48,410
He's got a beautiful swing.
The ball explodes off his bat.

111
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,705
He throws the club head at the ball,
and when he connects,

112
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:54,124
he drives it,
it pops off the bat.

113
00:08:54,124 --> 00:08:57,586
You can hear it all over the ballpark.
A lot of pop.

114
00:08:57,586 --> 00:08:59,838
If he's good,
why doesn't he hit good?

115
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:01,965
He is a good hitter.
He'll be ready.

116
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:04,843
He's gonna be a good hitter
against big-league arms?

117
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:06,804
Could be great.
I don't think so.

118
00:09:06,804 --> 00:09:10,265
Kid needs at bats. Give him 400
at bats, he's gonna get better.

119
00:09:10,265 --> 00:09:11,475
He can play.

120
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:13,519
He's hit everywhere
along the line.

121
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,270
He's one of our guys.

122
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,112
Okay, let's move on.

123
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:27,699
Artie, who do you like?
I like Perez. He's got a classic swing.

124
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:31,370
It's a real clean stroke.
I don't know. Can't hit the curveball.

125
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,040
There's some work to be done,
I'll admit that, but he's noticeable.

126
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,501
Got an ugly girlfriend.
What's that mean?

127
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:39,711
Ugly girlfriend
means no confidence.

128
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:43,215
You are full of it. Artie is right.
This guy's got an attitude.

129
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,633
An attitude is good.

130
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:48,262
He walks in a room, his dick's
already been there for two minutes.

131
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:50,722
He passes the eye-candy test.
Got the looks.

132
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:53,809
He's ready to play the part.
He just needs playing time.

133
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:56,603
I'm just saying,
his girlfriend is a six at best.

134
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:59,898
Look, if we're trying to replace
Giambi, this guy could be it.

135
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:02,442
I agree with you.
La-la-la-la-la.

136
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,905
Damn, Billy,
was that a suggestion?

137
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,825
Guys, you're just talking.

138
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:13,912
Talking, "la-la-la-la-la,"
like this is business as usual.

139
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:15,539
It's not.

140
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:18,125
We're trying to solve
the problem.

141
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,836
Not like this.
You're not looking at the problem.

142
00:10:20,836 --> 00:10:23,130
We're very aware
of the problem. I mean--

143
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,799
Okay, good. What's the problem?

144
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:34,433
Look, Billy, we all understand
what the problem is. We have to--

145
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,351
Okay, good.
What's the problem?

146
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:39,271
We have to replace three
key players in our lineup.

147
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,939
Nope. What's the problem?

148
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:43,692
We gotta replace these guys
with what we have--

149
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,569
No. What's the problem, Barry?

150
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:48,947
We need 38 home runs, 120 s
and 47 doubles to replace.

151
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:54,119
The problem we're trying to solve
is that there are rich teams

152
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:58,123
and there are poor teams,
then there's 50 feet of crap,

153
00:10:58,123 --> 00:11:00,459
and then there's us.

154
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:03,795
It's an unfair game.

155
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,761
And now we've been gutted.
We're like organ donors for the rich.

156
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:13,972
Boston's taken our kidneys,
Yankees have taken our heart.

157
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:15,515
And you guys sit around

158
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:20,729
talking the same old "good body"
nonsense like we're selling jeans.

159
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:23,148
Like we're looking for Fabio.

160
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:25,400
We got to think differently.

161
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:29,071
We are the last dog
at the bowl.

162
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:32,241
You see what happens to
the runt of the litter? He dies.

163
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:35,994
Billy, that's a very touching story
and everything,

164
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:39,581
but I think we're all very much
aware of what we're facing.

165
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:42,668
You have a lot of experience
and wisdom in this room.

166
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:47,005
You need to have a little faith and
let us do the job of replacing Giambi.

167
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:49,424
Is there another first
baseman like Giambi?

168
00:11:49,424 --> 00:11:50,926
No, not really.
No.

169
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:53,845
If there was, could we afford him?
Nope.

170
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:57,516
Then what the fuck
are you talking about, man?

171
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:01,353
If we try to play like the Yankees
in here,

172
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,356
we will lose to the Yankees
out there.

173
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:08,485
Boy, that sounds like
fortune-cookie wisdom to me, Billy.

174
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,197
No, that's just logic.
Who's Fabio?

175
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:15,033
He's a shortstop.
He's a shortstop from Seattle.

176
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:17,828
Now, this is no time
to push the panic button.

177
00:12:17,828 --> 00:12:21,498
Our scouts will find players,
Player Development will develop them.

178
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:24,042
We'll teach them to play
Oakland A baseball.

179
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:27,170
With all due respect, we've
been doing this a long time.

180
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:30,674
Why don't you just let us be
responsible for replacing Giambi

181
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:33,427
with who we know
that can play?

182
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,944
Easy power.
And loose.

183
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:52,654
Good face.

184
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:06,376
This son of a bitch
is going in the first round.

185
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,795
You're a premium player, Billy.

186
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:11,923
You can run, you can field,
you can throw, you can hit,

187
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:13,717
you can hit with power.

188
00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:15,761
That doesn't come along very often.

189
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,263
This is Tom Martinez,
national cross-checker.

190
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:19,765
How you doing?
Billy Beane.

191
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:20,932
Nice to meet you.

192
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:25,228
It's been a while since I've seen a
five-tool guy that can do everything.

193
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:28,440
I'm hopeful your interest
in professional baseball

194
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,320
is as strong as ours is gonna be
in getting you in this upcoming draft.

195
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:41,495
Mr. Beane?

196
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,289
Mark is ready
to see you now.

197
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:52,422
How you doing?
I'm fine.

198
00:13:52,422 --> 00:13:53,632
How are you?
Good.

199
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:57,386
Hey, Billy.
Hey, Mark.

200
00:13:57,386 --> 00:14:00,389
Good to see you. Please sit down.
You too.

201
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,476
These are the guys. Guys, Billy.
Boys.

202
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,145
How's it going?
All right. How you been?

203
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:11,233
You're filling out that chair nicely.
I got three weeks in it right now.

204
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,442
Good, good, man.

205
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:15,112
Yeah, man. How you doing?
Fantastic.

206
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:16,863
Awesome.
Couldn't be better.

207
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:19,741
That's good to hear.
I'm not gonna waste your time.

208
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:22,035
You just tell me
what you're looking for.

209
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:24,496
Fifty million dollars
in additional payroll.

210
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,123
You should try Giambi.

211
00:14:26,123 --> 00:14:28,083
Ouch.
I'm sorry. Too soon, right?

212
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,460
I want this to be
a friendly meeting.

213
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,254
It's not all
on your shoulders.

214
00:14:32,254 --> 00:14:34,464
Where's Steve in this?
Steve's great.

215
00:14:34,464 --> 00:14:36,675
He's supportive
in rebuilding this team.

216
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,343
That's what we're gonna do.

217
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:41,513
So, what are you looking for?
A left-handed reliever.

218
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:44,516
I'm thinking Ricardo Rincon.

219
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:46,852
That's not gonna happen.

220
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:50,147
Not even a discussion?

221
00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:55,318
Billy, even if you could afford him,
respectfully, we love him.

222
00:14:55,318 --> 00:14:57,446
We're not about to let him go.

223
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:59,614
You got this Venezuelan kid
coming up.

224
00:14:59,614 --> 00:15:02,117
We had him.
We moved him to Detroit.

225
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:04,870
Huh.
What else you thinking?

226
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,622
Outfielders.

227
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:10,500
To replace Damon?
Yeah.

228
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,504
In your price range? No disrespect.
Enough, Mark.

229
00:15:14,504 --> 00:15:17,007
Uh... Hollins?

230
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,134
Uh-uh.

231
00:15:20,094 --> 00:15:22,679
Garcia?
No.

232
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,556
Maybe Coste.

233
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:26,766
Uh-uh.

234
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:29,060
That's it.

235
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,732
All right, tell me about Garcia.
To replace Johnny Damon?

236
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,402
Mark, is he healthy?
Yeah, he's healthy-ish.

237
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:40,030
He had that back thing.

238
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,949
He'll be ready for spring ball.
I'll tell you what.

239
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:45,619
I can give you Guthrie
if you kick in some cash.

240
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:46,870
Mark Guthrie?
Yeah.

241
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,164
How much cash?
Two hundred K.

242
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:06,932
Okay.

243
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:11,770
So Garcia's gonna be a no.
You're kidding me, right?

244
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:15,023
You're kidding me.
I'm not.

245
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:19,945
Okay. Straight up,
Garcia for Guthrie, no kicker.

246
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:23,615
No kicker?
Straight up.

247
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:31,581
I think it's gonna be a hard no on
Garcia, but let's just keep going.

248
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:34,960
What else you thinking?
What are we doing? Is this business?

249
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,420
This is the way we do
business in Cleveland.

250
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:22,632
Hey.

251
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,344
Hello.
Who are you?

252
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,182
I'm Peter Brand.

253
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,810
What do you do?

254
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,772
I'm special assistant
to Mark Shapiro.

255
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:39,816
So, what do you do?

256
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,655
Mostly player analysis
right now.

257
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:49,534
Been on the job long?
First job in baseball?

258
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:53,371
It's my first job anywhere.

259
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,999
Wow, congrats.
Thank you.

260
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:58,793
First job.
Whose nephew are you?

261
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,048
Why does Mark listen to you?

262
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:08,053
I don't think, uh...

263
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,555
I don't think he does very often.

264
00:18:12,016 --> 00:18:13,892
He just did.

265
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:17,520
Well, in that circumstance,

266
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,232
I think he was more listening
to Bruce than myself.

267
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:24,235
Mm-hm. Who are you?

268
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:29,199
I'm Peter Brand.

269
00:18:32,203 --> 00:18:35,246
I don't give a rat's ass
what your name is.

270
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:38,124
What happened
in there?

271
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,544
What happened
in that room?

272
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:44,673
I'm not quite sure what
you're asking me, Mr. Beane.

273
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:47,258
What did you
tell Bruce?

274
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:52,931
I just told Bruce I like Garcia.
You like Garcia. Why?

275
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:56,935
Why?

276
00:19:01,982 --> 00:19:04,567
I don't know. Ahem.

277
00:19:21,127 --> 00:19:24,003
There is an epidemic failure
within the game

278
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:26,798
to understand
what is really happening.

279
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,428
And this leads people who run
Major League Baseball teams

280
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:35,765
to misjudge their players
and mismanage their teams.

281
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:42,313
I apologize.

282
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:44,315
Go on.

283
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:52,741
Okay. People who run ball clubs,
they think in terms of buying players.

284
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:57,912
Your goal shouldn't be to buy players.
Your goal should be to buy wins.

285
00:19:57,912 --> 00:20:01,458
And in order to buy wins,
you need to buy runs.

286
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,668
You're trying
to replace Johnny Damon.

287
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,795
The Red Sox see Johnny Damon

288
00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:09,632
and they see a star
who's worth $7.5 million a year.

289
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:12,677
When I see Johnny Damon,

290
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:15,180
what I see is...

291
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:20,018
an imperfect understanding
of where runs come from.

292
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:22,353
The guy's got a great glove.

293
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:25,482
He's a decent leadoff hitter.
He can steal bases.

294
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:28,026
But is he worth
the $7.5 million a year

295
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,361
that the Boston Red Sox
are paying him?

296
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,363
No. No.

297
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:34,824
Baseball thinking is medieval.

298
00:20:34,824 --> 00:20:37,494
They are asking
all the wrong questions.

299
00:20:37,494 --> 00:20:41,831
And if I say it to anybody,
I'm ostracized. I'm a leper.

300
00:20:41,831 --> 00:20:46,961
So that's why I'm cagey
about this with you.

301
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:48,171
That's why--

302
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:52,258
I respect you, Mr. Beane,
and if you want full disclosure,

303
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:57,305
I think it's a good thing that
you got Damon off your payroll.

304
00:20:57,305 --> 00:21:02,018
I think it opens up all kinds
of interesting possibilities.

305
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:05,271
Where you from, Pete?
Maryland.

306
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:08,733
Where'd you go to school?
Yale. I went to Yale.

307
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,737
What'd you study?
Economics.

308
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,949
I studied economics.

309
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:23,873
Yale, economics and baseball.

310
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,669
You're funny, Pete.

311
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:51,776
Tell me, why Billy?

312
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:54,904
What is it that makes him special?

313
00:21:54,904 --> 00:21:58,783
Very rare do you come upon
a young man like Billy

314
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:02,078
who can run, who can field,
who can throw, who can hit,

315
00:22:02,078 --> 00:22:03,830
and who can hit with power.

316
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,041
Those five tools,
you don't see that very often.

317
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,628
Most of the youngsters
that we have an interest in

318
00:22:10,628 --> 00:22:12,255
have one or two tools,

319
00:22:12,255 --> 00:22:15,049
and we're hoping
to develop an extra one.

320
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:17,135
Your son has five.

321
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:21,347
We're looking at a guy that's a
potential superstar for us in New York.

322
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:23,391
The time is now
to get him started.

323
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:26,394
We're prepared to make
a sizable financial commitment.

324
00:22:26,394 --> 00:22:28,980
The Mets are gonna
stand behind Billy

325
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,483
because we expect him
to be our big-league center fielder.

326
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:34,736
This check here
represents the offer

327
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:38,281
that the New York Mets
would be making to Billy.

328
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:43,578
You do know that he's been accepted
to Stanford on a full scholarship?

329
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:44,913
I do.

330
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:47,498
So he can do both?

331
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:52,003
Unfortunately, he can't do Stanford
and professional baseball.

332
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:56,090
He would have to pick one
or the other.

333
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,760
If he wants to be center fielder
for the Mets,

334
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,803
wants to be a baseball player,

335
00:23:00,803 --> 00:23:05,850
he really needs to accept this
as life's first occupation, first career.

336
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,771
We're all told at some point we can
no longer play the children's game.

337
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:12,440
We just don't know
when that's gonna be.

338
00:23:12,942 --> 00:23:17,028
Some of us are told at 18, some of
us are told at 40, but we're all told.

339
00:23:17,655 --> 00:23:20,865
But this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

340
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:25,620
We want you badly, and we think that this
amount of money expresses that desire.

341
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,165
Billy, this is your decision,
and whatever that decision is,

342
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:31,834
you know it's fine
with your mother and I.

343
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,973
Hello?
Hey, it's Billy Beane.

344
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:49,560
Hey, what time is it?
I don't know.

345
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:54,691
Listen, would you have
drafted me in the first round?

346
00:23:54,691 --> 00:23:56,275
What?

347
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:59,988
After I left, you looked me up
on your computer.

348
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:02,490
Would you have drafted me
in the first round?

349
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:05,576
I did, yeah.
You were a good player.

350
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:07,996
Cut the crap, man.

351
00:24:07,996 --> 00:24:11,082
Would you have drafted me
in the first round?

352
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,920
I'd have taken you in the
ninth round. No signing bonus.

353
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:21,259
I imagine you would've passed
and taken that scholarship.

354
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,845
Yeah.

355
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,934
Pack your bags, Pete.

356
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:33,396
I just bought you
from the Cleveland Indians.

357
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,621
Is it attached to that clamp?
Yeah, let me unhook it.

358
00:24:58,922 --> 00:25:00,298
Slide it up right there.

359
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:01,716
To the left.
I did.

360
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:03,968
Yeah, yeah.
Hang on, it's wet.

361
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:05,720
Come on.

362
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,118
Morning, Suzanne. Coffee on?
Yes.

363
00:25:29,118 --> 00:25:30,328
Great.

364
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:33,331
Billy Beane's office.
Hey.

365
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,499
Peter Brand.
Billy.

366
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,168
How are--? Hi, how you doing?
Nice to see you.

367
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:39,921
Good to have you here.
Boy, you move in fast.

368
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:42,090
Yeah, yeah.
I got here early this morning.

369
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,383
Wow. Huh.

370
00:25:44,383 --> 00:25:46,636
All moved in.
Yeah.

371
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,930
Yeah.

372
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,099
Hey, Billy,

373
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:54,185
I wanted you to see
these player evaluations

374
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:56,521
that you asked me to do.

375
00:25:57,481 --> 00:25:59,107
I asked you to do three.

376
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,359
Yeah.

377
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,112
To evaluate three players.
Yeah.

378
00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:06,239
How many did you do?

379
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:08,366
Forty-seven.

380
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:10,827
Okay.

381
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:15,456
Actually, 51.
I don't know why I lied just then.

382
00:26:24,466 --> 00:26:26,884
Why don't you walk me
through the board?

383
00:26:28,345 --> 00:26:29,929
Thank you.

384
00:26:56,206 --> 00:26:58,249
Using this equation
in the upper left,

385
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,544
I'm projecting that we need
to win at least 99 games

386
00:27:01,544 --> 00:27:03,880
in order to make it
to the postseason.

387
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,176
We need to score at least 814 runs
in order to win those games

388
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:11,429
and allow no more
than 645 runs.

389
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,852
What's this?

390
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:21,606
This is a code that I've written
for our year-to-year projections.

391
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:25,443
This is building in the intelligence
that we have to project players.

392
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,611
Okay.

393
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,447
It's about getting things down
to one number.

394
00:27:29,907 --> 00:27:32,450
Using the stats
the way we read them,

395
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,786
we'll find value in players
that nobody else can see.

396
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,625
People are overlooked

397
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:44,587
for a variety of biased reasons
and perceived flaws.

398
00:27:44,587 --> 00:27:48,049
Age, appearance, personality.

399
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:52,970
Bill James and mathematics
cut straight through that.

400
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:57,850
Billy, of the 20,000 notable players
for us to consider,

401
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,561
I believe that there is
a championship team

402
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:03,898
of 25 people that we can afford,

403
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:07,235
because everyone else
in baseball undervalues them.

404
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:10,655
Like an island of misfit toys.

405
00:28:15,118 --> 00:28:18,329
Billy, this is Chad Bradford.
He's a relief pitcher.

406
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:22,792
He is one of the most undervalued
players in baseball.

407
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:25,920
His defect is that he throws funny.

408
00:28:26,755 --> 00:28:30,841
Nobody in the big leagues cares
about him because he looks funny.

409
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:34,095
This guy could be not just
the best pitcher in our pen,

410
00:28:34,095 --> 00:28:37,682
but one of the most effective
relief pitchers in all baseball.

411
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:40,601
This guy should cost
$3 million a year.

412
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:43,646
We can get him for 237,000.

413
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,005
Billy.

414
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:12,925
That it?
Yeah.

415
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,415
Hey, Art.

416
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,792
Can I talk to you
before you get started?

417
00:29:46,792 --> 00:29:49,420
I'm a bit busy right now.
I know.

418
00:29:51,298 --> 00:29:52,882
I know.
Okay.

419
00:29:52,882 --> 00:29:54,717
Morning, everyone.
Art.

420
00:29:54,717 --> 00:29:58,137
Peter Brand. Nice to meet you.
Where the hell's Pete?

421
00:29:58,137 --> 00:29:59,388
That's Pete.

422
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,767
Grab a seat.
I'll be right back.

423
00:30:03,894 --> 00:30:05,936
All right,
where did you say he's at?

424
00:30:05,936 --> 00:30:07,188
Okay. He's on--

425
00:30:07,898 --> 00:30:10,566
Who's the kid?
A friend of mine.

426
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,279
I can't manage this team
under a one-year contract.

427
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,239
Well, sure you can.

428
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,077
No, I can't.

429
00:30:21,077 --> 00:30:23,788
Okay. I gotta put a team
on the field.

430
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:27,458
After that, I'll take a good
long look at your contract.

431
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:30,920
Deal with the manager's contract,
then put a team on the field.

432
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,466
At this moment, if a grounder's hit
to first, nobody's there to stop it.

433
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:40,638
It's not easy doing what I do under
the cloud of a one-year contract.

434
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,223
Okay, I understand that.

435
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:44,350
I've been there.
I know you have.

436
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,979
A one-year contract means the same
thing to a manager as to a player.

437
00:30:48,979 --> 00:30:51,315
There's not a lot of faith there.

438
00:30:51,315 --> 00:30:54,276
Which is strange
after a 102-win season.

439
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,040
I see.

440
00:30:57,447 --> 00:31:01,784
If you lose the last game
of the season, nobody gives a shit.

441
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:07,665
So it's on me now?
No, Art, it's on me.

442
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:11,168
And the kid
is the new assistant .

443
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:13,337
Okay.
Okay, fellas.

444
00:31:13,337 --> 00:31:15,172
Hey, Billy.

445
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:28,269
You can't deny his
offensive output. He can play.

446
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:31,439
And we need people
that can play.

447
00:31:37,654 --> 00:31:40,030
Who do you wanna
talk about first?

448
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:58,799
None of them.

449
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:02,511
Billy, we got 38 home runs,
120 s to make up for.

450
00:32:02,511 --> 00:32:05,055
Guys, you're still trying
to replace Giambi.

451
00:32:05,055 --> 00:32:08,726
I told you we can't do it,
and we can't do it.

452
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:13,481
Now, what we might be able
to do is re-create him.

453
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:16,650
Re-create him in the aggregate.
The what?

454
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,570
Giambi's on-base percentage
was .477.

455
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,200
Damon's on-base, .324.
And Olmedo's was .291.

456
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,577
Add that up and you get...

457
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,539
Do you want me to speak?

458
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,417
When I point at you, yeah.

459
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,586
1 .092.
Divided by three.

460
00:32:36,963 --> 00:32:39,465
.364.
That's what we're looking for.

461
00:32:39,465 --> 00:32:43,761
Three ballplayers
-- Three ballplayers whose average is...

462
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:45,262
.364.

463
00:32:45,262 --> 00:32:48,307
Wait, that doesn't come out right.
It's right, Artie.

464
00:32:48,975 --> 00:32:50,768
Billy.
You gotta carry the one.

465
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,312
Billy.
Scratch this out.

466
00:32:53,312 --> 00:32:54,563
Yeah?

467
00:32:54,563 --> 00:32:56,315
Who's that?

468
00:32:56,315 --> 00:32:58,108
That's Pete.

469
00:32:59,027 --> 00:33:01,612
Does Pete really need to be here?

470
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:02,780
Yes, he does.

471
00:33:04,407 --> 00:33:06,784
Okay, here's who we want.

472
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:10,204
Number one:
Jason's little brother, Jeremy.

473
00:33:10,204 --> 00:33:13,249
Oh, God.
Billy, that's trouble.

474
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:18,295
Billy, look, if I
-- Yeah. Billy, if I may, he's had his problems off the field,

475
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:20,798
and we know what he can't do
on the field.

476
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:22,883
He's getting thick around the waist.

477
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:25,719
There's reports about him
on weed, in strip clubs.

478
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:28,556
His on-base percentage
is all we're looking at now.

479
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:34,144
And Jeremy gets on base an awful lot
for a guy who only costs 285,000.

480
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:37,314
Jeez, Billy--
Number two:

481
00:33:38,942 --> 00:33:40,818
David Justice.
Oh, no.

482
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:42,861
His legs are gone.
Not a good idea.

483
00:33:42,861 --> 00:33:44,655
Old Man Justice?
Why is that?

484
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:49,952
Steinbrenner's so pissed at his decline, he's
willing to eat his contract to get rid of him.

485
00:33:49,952 --> 00:33:52,830
Exactly.
Ten years ago, Justice, big name.

486
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,039
Been in big games.

487
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:57,459
He's gonna really help our
season tickets early in the year,

488
00:33:57,459 --> 00:34:02,256
but in the dog days in July, August,
we're lucky if he's gonna hit his weight.

489
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:06,093
Billy, his legs are gone,
and he's a defensive liability.

490
00:34:06,093 --> 00:34:08,429
I question whether
the bat speed's there.

491
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,055
His legs are gone.
Grady.

492
00:34:10,055 --> 00:34:14,143
We'll be lucky to get 60 games
out of him. Why do you like him?

493
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,520
Because he gets on base.

494
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,107
What is this?
What are we doing?

495
00:34:20,107 --> 00:34:22,359
Okay, number three:

496
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,117
Scott Hatteberg.
Who?

497
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:31,368
Hatteberg?
Exactly.

498
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:33,370
He sounds like an Oakland A
already.

499
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:37,541
Yes, he's had a little problem with--
Little problem? He can't throw.

500
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:41,378
He's a career .260 hitter.
The best part of his career is over.

501
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:44,340
It's just getting started.
Boston wants to cut him.

502
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,051
No one wants to pick him up.
Good. He's cheap.

503
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,887
Let me get this straight.
You're gonna get a guy

504
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:53,390
that's been released by half
the organizations in baseball

505
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:57,728
because he's got nonrepairable nerve
damage in his elbow and can't throw.

506
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:01,231
He can't throw and he can't
field. But what can he do?

507
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:02,441
Oh, boy.

508
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:05,027
Check your reports
or I'm gonna point at Pete.

509
00:35:05,027 --> 00:35:07,696
He gets on base.
He can get on base.

510
00:35:07,696 --> 00:35:10,449
So he walks a lot.
He gets on base a lot, Rocco.

511
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:13,243
Do I care
if it's a walk or a hit?

512
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:14,787
Pete?

513
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:17,206
You do not.
I do not.

514
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:20,417
I got 37 free agents
that are better than those three guys.

515
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:22,836
Wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

516
00:35:22,836 --> 00:35:25,673
So you're not gonna bring in one

517
00:35:25,673 --> 00:35:29,176
but three defective players
to replace Giambi?

518
00:35:29,886 --> 00:35:32,346
You're not buying into
this Bill James bullshit?

519
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:34,515
This is the new
direction of the A's.

520
00:35:34,515 --> 00:35:37,601
We are card counters
at the blackjack table

521
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:40,479
and we're gonna turn the odds
on the casino.

522
00:35:41,815 --> 00:35:43,565
I don't see it.
Seriously, guys.

523
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:46,443
I think we have to remember
this is the man.

524
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:52,032
He answers to no one
except ownership and God.

525
00:35:52,032 --> 00:35:55,077
And he doesn't
have to answer to us.

526
00:35:55,077 --> 00:35:57,663
We make suggestions,
he makes decisions.

527
00:35:57,663 --> 00:36:01,250
That's all fine and well, but
we've been working our asses off

528
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,254
for weeks to make this club better,
and you're shitting all over it.

529
00:36:05,254 --> 00:36:07,923
This is not a discussion.

530
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,635
What are we discussing?

531
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:13,637
Barry, not a discussion.

532
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:21,520
Billy, man, um,

533
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:24,231
there's one thing
you're forgetting.

534
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:29,570
None of those three guys
knows how to play first base.

535
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:32,072
Well, you're gonna have
to teach one of them.

536
00:36:32,072 --> 00:36:33,657
Teach?

537
00:36:34,784 --> 00:36:36,493
Which one?

538
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:52,134
This is really the kickoff to the
holiday season here in downtown Seattle.

539
00:36:52,134 --> 00:36:56,680
It took weeks of planning to lead up to
the big event, but it was well worth it.

540
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,309
The weather was ideal.
People are still having a great time.

541
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:02,352
Thousands of people
were out earlier.

542
00:37:02,352 --> 00:37:04,188
We have a nice recap for you

543
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:07,858
of all the great events taking place
downtown in Seattle--

544
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:13,530
Hello?
Scott?

545
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,698
Yes.

546
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:17,868
It's Billy Beane of the Oakland A's.
Yes.

547
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:20,913
Can we talk?
Uh, yeah.

548
00:37:20,913 --> 00:37:23,040
Do you wanna let us in?

549
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,585
Pardon me?
We're out front.

550
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,214
What?
On the curb.

551
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,174
Uh, yeah, yeah.

552
00:37:34,093 --> 00:37:35,177
Honey?

553
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:41,558
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, ma'am.

554
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:43,393
Very kind.

555
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,732
How's the elbow, Scott?

556
00:37:48,732 --> 00:37:52,945
You know, it's good.
It's really good. It's great. Uh...

557
00:37:58,785 --> 00:38:00,911
I can't throw the ball at all.
Yeah.

558
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,789
You've thrown your last ball
from behind home plate.

559
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:06,166
That's what I'd say.
Well...

560
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:10,170
Good news is,
we want you at first.

561
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:21,014
We want you to play
first base for the Oakland A's.

562
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:24,393
Okay, well,

563
00:38:24,393 --> 00:38:26,311
I've only ever played catcher.

564
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:28,939
Scott, you're not
a catcher anymore.

565
00:38:30,024 --> 00:38:33,443
If you were, our call wouldn't
have been the only one you got.

566
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:38,532
Yeah. Hey, listen, no, I appreciate it.
You're welcome.

567
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:43,453
But the thing is, is...
You don't know how to play first base.

568
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:45,122
Scott.
That's right.

569
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:47,207
It's not that hard, Scott.

570
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:49,585
Tell him, Wash.
It's incredibly hard.

571
00:38:49,585 --> 00:38:52,921
Hey, anything worth doing is.
And we're gonna teach you.

572
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:55,424
Wait a minute here.
I mean, but what about--?

573
00:38:55,424 --> 00:38:57,718
Jason's gone, Scott.

574
00:38:58,177 --> 00:39:00,721
You want me to take
Giambi's spot at first base?

575
00:39:00,721 --> 00:39:02,139
Yeah.
What about the fans?

576
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,809
Maybe I can teach one of them.
The fans don't-- Good one.

577
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:07,352
Fans don't run
my ball club.

578
00:39:07,352 --> 00:39:09,730
Honey, what are you doing awake?

579
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,482
Sweetheart, can you...?

580
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,444
That's my daughter.

581
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,780
You got kids?

582
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,575
Uh, yeah, a daughter.

583
00:39:21,575 --> 00:39:26,163
Scott, this is a contract to play ball
for the Oakland A's.

584
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,415
A copy's been sent over
to your agent.

585
00:39:28,415 --> 00:39:31,460
Discuss with your wife,
let us know.

586
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,712
Thank you.

587
00:39:33,712 --> 00:39:35,172
Bye-bye.
Bye.

588
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,341
Oh, and, Scott.
Yeah?

589
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:39,551
Don't tell anyone
about the first-base thing.

590
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:41,011
Yes, sir.
Okay.

591
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,680
Happy holidays.
All right.

592
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,540
Hey, Sharon.
Hi, Billy.

593
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,961
Is she ready?
She's out with friends.

594
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,172
But she'll be back. Come in.

595
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,217
Okay.
Yeah, she's right here. Hold on.

596
00:40:20,217 --> 00:40:21,718
Here you go.

597
00:40:23,846 --> 00:40:27,474
Here, wanna have a seat?
Yeah.

598
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:38,402
You good, Billy?
Yeah. How are you, Alan?

599
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:41,947
Good. Really good. Things
are peaceful around here.

600
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:46,076
It's good to see you.

601
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,203
Thanks, Alan.

602
00:40:48,203 --> 00:40:50,497
I haven't got to see you
since play-offs.

603
00:40:50,497 --> 00:40:53,166
I wanted to say that New York
was heartbreaking.

604
00:40:53,793 --> 00:40:55,210
I'm sure for you too.

605
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:59,339
Not many teams make it that far,
and to watch you go that far was--

606
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:05,012
It was really an accomplishment.
Well, that's nice.

607
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:08,098
How is the team shaping up?

608
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:12,019
Team's good. Rebuilding.
Good.

609
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:15,272
I read you lost
Giambonni and Damon.

610
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,440
Giambi.
Giambi.

611
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,276
Yeah.
Damon, Isringhausen.

612
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:23,447
They're really--? They're gone?
Gone. Yesterday's news.

613
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,992
That's terrible.
No, but that is a tough situation.

614
00:41:26,992 --> 00:41:28,785
That's...

615
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:32,330
You're gonna be fine, though.
You always figure something out.

616
00:41:36,169 --> 00:41:39,463
Where is she? Where was
she? Down the street or...?

617
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:43,633
Oh, sorry, yeah. I just talked to her
on her cell. She's coming up the hill.

618
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:45,093
Okay.

619
00:41:45,093 --> 00:41:47,471
She's got a cell phone?

620
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,557
Yeah.
A 12-year-old?

621
00:41:50,557 --> 00:41:52,225
Yeah.

622
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,227
Huh.

623
00:41:55,146 --> 00:41:56,313
For emergencies.

624
00:41:58,316 --> 00:42:00,484
Big parenting decision.

625
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:05,113
But it's something that, you know,
we, you know, all should discuss,

626
00:42:05,113 --> 00:42:08,742
because if you have
any objections, of course...

627
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:11,369
Her mother and I
will discuss it.

628
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:13,955
But thank you.

629
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,252
Any of these?
Um...

630
00:42:19,252 --> 00:42:20,921
I don't know.

631
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:23,131
Do you--?
This one's cool.

632
00:42:23,131 --> 00:42:24,841
Is that good or bad?

633
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:26,927
Butterflies.
They're okay.

634
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:30,055
Look, that one's pretty.
I like the red.

635
00:42:30,055 --> 00:42:31,848
Should we try?

636
00:42:32,558 --> 00:42:33,850
No?

637
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,644
Oh, I like this one.
Yeah?

638
00:42:35,644 --> 00:42:37,187
Dad, look at this one.

639
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,648
Look how it's red.
It's beautiful.

640
00:42:39,648 --> 00:42:42,192
This one's pretty.
Let's try it out.

641
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,736
Just right here?
Why don't we go over there?

642
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:46,446
Can we go over there?

643
00:43:05,007 --> 00:43:09,052
Oh, honey, you need to sing.
That's so good.

644
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:11,888
That's beautiful.

645
00:43:13,432 --> 00:43:14,474
Sometimes I sing.

646
00:43:14,474 --> 00:43:20,313
It's fun to sing with your song, but
I don't want people to listen to me.

647
00:43:20,313 --> 00:43:24,359
Well, honey, I think people would love
to listen to you. That's beautiful.

648
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:28,446
Would you sing a little
for your dad?

649
00:43:28,446 --> 00:43:30,740
Right here
in the middle of the store?

650
00:43:33,578 --> 00:43:35,996
Little bit.
Little bit.

651
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,457
You ready?
I'm ready.

652
00:43:39,457 --> 00:43:40,876
Okay.

653
00:44:15,328 --> 00:44:18,580
Billy Beane was taken in the
first round of the amateur draft.

654
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:22,709
He's young, he's talented.

655
00:44:22,709 --> 00:44:27,214
A true five-tool player with speed.
This guy is a can't-miss prospect.

656
00:44:27,214 --> 00:44:29,633
This is a great sign
for the New York Mets.

657
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:33,261
And it could be the turnaround
that they've been looking for.

658
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:35,138
Ball one.

659
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:37,849
I'll take Billy Beane
over Strawberry.

660
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:41,436
Billy Beane, an interesting pick,
turned down a scholarship.

661
00:44:41,436 --> 00:44:43,146
He could've gone to Stanford.

662
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:46,650
Sometimes you don't find out
till you get to the big leagues...

663
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:47,817
Strike!

664
00:44:47,817 --> 00:44:51,446
This guy has never failed at anything.
He's coming out of high school.

665
00:44:51,446 --> 00:44:55,242
Billy was gonna go to college. He
could've been a great quarterback.

666
00:45:03,084 --> 00:45:04,960
Strike three.

667
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:08,797
There's not an organization
in baseball

668
00:45:08,797 --> 00:45:13,802
who would not have taken
a chance on this young guy.

669
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:18,765
He didn't pan out.
That happens every year.

670
00:45:20,226 --> 00:45:23,061
Some do, some don't.

671
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:27,274
I mean, if you're having
any doubt at all about this...

672
00:45:29,735 --> 00:45:31,194
Having the scholarship...

673
00:45:31,194 --> 00:45:34,447
Your son was born
with a God-given ability.

674
00:45:38,995 --> 00:45:43,665
and determine whether he's really
confident about what he can do.

675
00:45:43,665 --> 00:45:45,542
A very special player.

676
00:45:48,504 --> 00:45:52,048
but then he's gotta be successful
to be confident.

677
00:45:52,048 --> 00:45:56,886
And once he becomes confident,
that's when you've got something.

678
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:03,560
You make a decision
on what you see.

679
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:07,272
And if things don't pan out,
you move on.

680
00:46:07,272 --> 00:46:09,482
That's baseball.

681
00:46:09,482 --> 00:46:11,693
Many are called, few are chosen.

682
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:18,325
Billy, that is Kevin Youkilis.
That is the Greek God of Walks.

683
00:46:18,325 --> 00:46:19,826
That's my hero.

684
00:46:19,826 --> 00:46:22,996
That man gets walked
more than anybody in baseball

685
00:46:22,996 --> 00:46:25,081
except for Barry Bonds.

686
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:28,752
I tried to convince Shapiro
to pick him up last June,

687
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:31,296
but he said he waddled
like a duck.

688
00:46:31,797 --> 00:46:34,007
Yeah, Boston snagged him.

689
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:36,092
I think they wanna wait and see.

690
00:46:43,059 --> 00:46:46,269
Are you okay, Billy?
Billy?

691
00:46:46,854 --> 00:46:48,271
Can we talk?

692
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:51,066
Yeah. Yeah.

693
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:04,245
You're unhappy, Grady. Why?

694
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:09,542
Wow.

695
00:47:10,169 --> 00:47:12,462
May I speak candidly?
Sure, go ahead.

696
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:16,508
Major League Baseball and its fans,
they're gonna be more than happy

697
00:47:16,508 --> 00:47:19,135
to throw you and Google Boy
under the bus

698
00:47:19,135 --> 00:47:21,304
if you keep doing
what you're doing.

699
00:47:21,304 --> 00:47:23,848
You don't put a team together
with a computer.

700
00:47:23,848 --> 00:47:25,767
No?
No.

701
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:28,645
Baseball isn't just numbers.
It's not science.

702
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:31,981
If it was, anybody could do
what we're doing, but they can't.

703
00:47:31,981 --> 00:47:33,900
They don't know what we know.

704
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,153
They don't have our experience
and our intuition.

705
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:38,780
Okay.

706
00:47:39,365 --> 00:47:42,826
You got a kid in there that's got
a degree in economics from Yale.

707
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:46,162
You got a scout here with
29 years of baseball experience.

708
00:47:46,162 --> 00:47:48,915
You're listening to the wrong one.

709
00:47:48,915 --> 00:47:52,919
Now, there are intangibles that
only baseball people understand.

710
00:47:52,919 --> 00:47:56,339
You're discounting what scouts
have done for 150 years?

711
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:58,550
Even yourself?

712
00:47:59,218 --> 00:48:01,386
Adapt or die.

713
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:06,516
This is about you
and your shit, isn't it?

714
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,601
Twenty years ago,
some scout got it wrong.

715
00:48:08,601 --> 00:48:12,439
Whoa. Okay. Okay.
Now you declare war on the system.

716
00:48:12,439 --> 00:48:17,318
Okay, okay, my turn.
You don't have a crystal ball.

717
00:48:17,318 --> 00:48:21,072
You can't look at a kid and predict
his future any more than I can.

718
00:48:21,072 --> 00:48:23,533
I've sat at those kitchen tables
with you

719
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:26,703
and listened to you tell parents,
"When I know, I know.

720
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:28,872
And when it comes
to your son, I know."

721
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,499
And you don't.

722
00:48:33,085 --> 00:48:34,878
You don't.

723
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,841
Okay. I don't give a shit
about friendship,

724
00:48:39,841 --> 00:48:42,552
this situation, or the past.

725
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:46,347
Major League Baseball thinks the
way I think. You're not gonna win.

726
00:48:46,347 --> 00:48:49,100
And I'll give you a nickel's worth
of free advice.

727
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,561
You're never gonna
get another job

728
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:55,315
after this catastrophic season
you're about to set us all up for.

729
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:57,484
You'll have to explain
to your kid

730
00:48:57,484 --> 00:49:00,195
why you're working
at Dick's Sporting Goods.

731
00:49:05,951 --> 00:49:08,411
I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.

732
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:15,418
Fuck you, Billy.
Now I will.

733
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,174
Good luck, Art.

734
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:30,350
Kubota.
You never played ball, right?

735
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:33,353
I played a little T-ball.
You're the new head scout.

736
00:49:33,353 --> 00:49:35,230
Congratulations.

737
00:49:43,656 --> 00:49:45,990
So Boston's gonna
wait and see?

738
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:48,952
Yeah.

739
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:52,789
Yeah.
It's just you and me, Pete.

740
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,707
And we're all in.

741
00:50:01,674 --> 00:50:04,384
I'm not. I just don't know
what you're gonna do

742
00:50:04,384 --> 00:50:07,929
with the budget that the A's have.
Who are you gonna get?

743
00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:10,265
I'm looking
at the spring-training roster.

744
00:50:10,265 --> 00:50:12,141
You gotta be kidding me.
How so?

745
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:16,145
Who?
Chad Bradford.

746
00:50:16,145 --> 00:50:18,189
Tell me about Bradford.

747
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:24,028
He's not a guy that you say,
"The eighth inning is yours,

748
00:50:24,028 --> 00:50:26,030
lefties vs. righties."

749
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,865
In my opinion.

750
00:50:27,865 --> 00:50:31,995
I don't know what Billy Beane and
management understands about him.

751
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:35,790
He only throws the ball about 82, 83
miles an hour. There must be something--

752
00:50:40,129 --> 00:50:42,589
Talking about
trying to win a division.

753
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:45,508
We're counting on David
to be the guy he was.

754
00:50:45,508 --> 00:50:48,177
I have my doubts. He's gotten old.

755
00:50:48,177 --> 00:50:51,848
That's why he's not in New York
anymore, not in Cleveland anymore.

756
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:55,351
We paid him the money we should've
been giving to Johnny Damon.

757
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:57,186
Hey.
Jeremy Giambi.

758
00:50:57,186 --> 00:50:59,564
That's the one to worry about.

759
00:50:59,564 --> 00:51:02,525
He gets comps up and down Vegas
more than in Oakland.

760
00:51:02,525 --> 00:51:05,028
That should tell you something
right there.

761
00:51:09,158 --> 00:51:12,619
And he gets a huge offer
and then he gets traded.

762
00:51:14,997 --> 00:51:18,124
Bob. Harder.
Hatteberg.

763
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:24,464
Good. Good.

764
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:27,550
Billy, we have to talk
about Hatteberg.

765
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,178
Go.
There's just no feel for the spot.

766
00:51:30,178 --> 00:51:33,890
I think it's a long shot that he can be
a big-league first baseman.

767
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,352
It's day one of the first week.
You can't judge this yet.

768
00:51:37,352 --> 00:51:39,103
No, I think
we can judge it.

769
00:51:39,103 --> 00:51:43,566
I mean, I like him, you know,
but I can judge him.

770
00:51:43,566 --> 00:51:45,360
First base is
the moon to him.

771
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:49,405
It wasn't to Giambi. Giambi's the
worst first baseman in baseball.

772
00:51:49,405 --> 00:51:53,076
Gonna compare him to Giambi?
What are we talking about?

773
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:54,535
All right.

774
00:51:56,538 --> 00:51:57,830
What do you think, Wash?

775
00:51:58,374 --> 00:52:01,834
The nice way to say it
is he lacks confidence.

776
00:52:01,834 --> 00:52:03,503
Well, give him some.

777
00:52:04,213 --> 00:52:06,798
I'll do that, but we got Pena,
who can play first.

778
00:52:06,798 --> 00:52:09,384
And he's looking
mighty good out there.

779
00:52:10,177 --> 00:52:12,261
We wanna go with Hattie.

780
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,851
We got six weeks.

781
00:52:18,851 --> 00:52:20,311
Get down in it.

782
00:52:27,069 --> 00:52:28,403
There you go.
Scotty H.

783
00:52:28,403 --> 00:52:31,239
That's what I'm talking about.
Picking machine.

784
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:33,741
It's only baseball.

785
00:52:39,915 --> 00:52:41,958
This better work.

786
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,211
I'm just kidding you.

787
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:01,519
Let's go, Oakland!

788
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:03,479
Let's go, Oakland!

789
00:53:06,442 --> 00:53:09,819
What is wrong with this thing?
It's a dollar, man.

790
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:12,405
What?
Welcome to Oakland, D.J.

791
00:53:12,405 --> 00:53:14,615
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

792
00:53:14,615 --> 00:53:18,619
I think this year, we're gonna
show that it takes a team to win,

793
00:53:18,619 --> 00:53:20,955
not any individual guy,
just a team.

794
00:53:20,955 --> 00:53:24,500
And I think we got
a hell of a ball club here.

795
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,711
Chad, are you intimidated
at all today?

796
00:53:26,711 --> 00:53:32,091
I wouldn't say I'm intimidated, really.
I'm just really excited, like you said.

797
00:53:32,091 --> 00:53:35,762
Jeremy, how's the team gonna fare
without your brother, Jason?

798
00:53:35,762 --> 00:53:38,639
Well, you know,
the organization did a great job

799
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:41,517
of bringing in good young guys
to fill that role.

800
00:53:41,517 --> 00:53:44,103
Let's face it,
they're getting a deal with you.

801
00:53:44,103 --> 00:53:46,522
The Yankees are paying
Jason a lot of money.

802
00:53:46,522 --> 00:53:49,776
You are coming here on a dime.
How does that make you feel?

803
00:53:49,776 --> 00:53:51,861
I feel good. Um...

804
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:55,031
How are the nerves in your fingers?
You know.

805
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:57,241
Gotta start with the age,
36 years old.

806
00:53:57,241 --> 00:53:59,660
How do you think
your body's gonna hold up?

807
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:03,039
You spend a lot of time
at strip clubs, partying.

808
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,792
Do you resent the attention
you get off the field?

809
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:07,001
I love it.

810
00:54:07,001 --> 00:54:09,378
You spend a lot of time in Vegas.
I do.

811
00:54:09,378 --> 00:54:13,758
I feel great. I did a lot of work to get--
Excuse me. Get out of my shot.

812
00:54:13,758 --> 00:54:14,967
Sorry, go ahead.

813
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:17,261
There have been questions
about my age

814
00:54:17,261 --> 00:54:21,182
and my declining skills, some say,
but I'm here to prove that wrong.

815
00:54:21,182 --> 00:54:23,059
I asked if you were
100 percent.

816
00:54:32,027 --> 00:54:33,903
Excuse me, Mr. Beane?
Hey, Chad.

817
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:37,365
Hey, I'm not disturbing you, am I?
Not at all. What's up?

818
00:54:37,365 --> 00:54:40,618
I wanted to say thank you
for this opportunity.

819
00:54:40,618 --> 00:54:44,247
Well, we enjoy having you. It's
gonna work out well for all of us.

820
00:54:44,247 --> 00:54:48,334
I appreciate it, sir. Nobody's ever
given me a chance like this before.

821
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:50,002
Nobody?

822
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:53,172
Well, just you, sir.

823
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:57,093
Well, it's a big day,
one you won't forget.

824
00:54:57,093 --> 00:54:59,428
Appreciate it.
And I wanna let you know

825
00:54:59,428 --> 00:55:02,431
I'm gonna be praying for you
and your family.

826
00:55:02,975 --> 00:55:04,767
No problem.

827
00:55:05,394 --> 00:55:08,980
Well, here we are just minutes away
from the season opener of 2002

828
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,356
for the Oakland A's.

829
00:55:10,356 --> 00:55:12,233
The first pitch is moments away.

830
00:55:12,233 --> 00:55:14,527
We'll come back
with the national anthem.

831
00:55:14,527 --> 00:55:16,112
Opening day is upon us.

832
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:20,116
All right, fellas, smile.
Here we go.

833
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,459
I'm going in.
Text me the play-by-play.

834
00:55:30,459 --> 00:55:32,211
What? Why?

835
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:35,089
I don't watch the games.

836
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,224
Detail, halt!

837
00:55:46,602 --> 00:55:49,478
And forward face!

838
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,708
That's the third Ranger batter
to be hit today.

839
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:56,212
Twice Alex Rodriguez was nicked.
The ninth--

840
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:35,251
I should've made you a bigger part
of the conversation from day one.

841
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,420
It'd be clear what
we're trying to do.

842
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,548
That was my mistake, Art.
I take responsibility for that.

843
00:57:40,548 --> 00:57:42,383
What are you trying to say?

844
00:57:42,383 --> 00:57:47,263
Doesn't matter what moves I make if you don't
play the team the way they're designed to be.

845
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:51,392
Billy, you're out of your depth.

846
00:57:52,561 --> 00:57:55,604
Why not Hatteberg at first?
Because he can't play first.

847
00:57:55,604 --> 00:57:58,190
How do you know?
Not my first baseball game.

848
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:01,068
Scott Hatteberg can't hit.
He gets on base.

849
00:58:01,068 --> 00:58:04,613
Still keeps us in the plus column.
We need to be seven over .500.

850
00:58:04,613 --> 00:58:06,365
What?

851
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,912
Anything else?

852
00:58:11,912 --> 00:58:16,333
Yeah. I would've rather seen
Bradford in the end than Magnante.

853
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,002
Bradford's a righty.

854
00:58:18,002 --> 00:58:21,297
I don't care about righty-lefty.
I do.

855
00:58:25,927 --> 00:58:29,055
Could this be about your contract?
No.

856
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:33,601
This is about you doing your job
and me doing mine.

857
00:58:33,601 --> 00:58:35,311
Mine's me being left alone

858
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:38,397
to manage this team
you assembled for me.

859
00:58:38,397 --> 00:58:41,650
I didn't assemble them for you, Art.
No shit.

860
00:58:50,535 --> 00:58:51,994
Good meeting.

861
00:58:51,994 --> 00:58:53,287
Every time we talk,

862
00:58:53,287 --> 00:58:56,248
I'm reinvigorated
by my love of the game.

863
00:59:19,606 --> 00:59:23,025
We got Grady Fuson, former head
of scouting with the Athletics.

864
00:59:23,025 --> 00:59:25,986
And, Grady, can you interpret for us
what's going on?

865
00:59:25,986 --> 00:59:28,322
They call it Moneyball.
Moneyball?

866
00:59:28,322 --> 00:59:33,035
Yes, and it was a nice theory,
and now it's just not working out.

867
00:59:33,035 --> 00:59:37,206
Billy Beane has built this team
on the ideas of a guy, Bill James,

868
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:42,044
who wrote an interesting book
on baseball statistics.

869
00:59:42,044 --> 00:59:46,215
The problem is that Bill James
never played, never managed.

870
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:50,970
He was in fact a security guard
at a pork-and-beans company.

871
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,806
Do you see this as a decimation
of the organization?

872
00:59:53,806 --> 00:59:55,641
He bought a ticket on the Titanic.

873
00:59:55,641 --> 00:59:56,851
Oh, boy.

874
00:59:56,851 --> 00:59:59,061
He's tried to come up
with a new approach.

875
00:59:59,061 --> 01:00:02,314
My hat's off to him. It won't work.

876
01:00:03,066 --> 01:00:06,110
One-two pitch. Tejada strikes out.

877
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,444
And that is the game.

878
01:00:07,444 --> 01:00:10,698
The Seattle Mariners
win both games on this series, Ray.

879
01:00:10,698 --> 01:00:14,410
They've won 10 in a row.
Seattle is 13 and 3.

880
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,415
I can't watch this shit.

881
01:00:20,542 --> 01:00:22,084
Go on the road with the team.

882
01:00:22,084 --> 01:00:24,461
You don't go on the road
with the team.

883
01:00:24,461 --> 01:00:28,257
That's why I want you to do it.
Why don't you?

884
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:32,595
I can't develop personal
relationships with these guys.

885
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:35,306
I gotta be able to trade them,
send them down,

886
01:00:35,306 --> 01:00:37,308
sometimes cut them.

887
01:00:39,477 --> 01:00:42,438
Which is something you should
learn to do, by the way.

888
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:48,194
I would never have to
cut a player, unless you...

889
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,947
Oh, come on.
"Come on" what?

890
01:00:51,947 --> 01:00:54,617
Let's practice.
No.

891
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:57,661
Yeah. I'm a player.
You gotta cut me from the roster.

892
01:00:57,661 --> 01:00:58,871
No.
Go.

893
01:00:58,871 --> 01:01:00,497
What do you mean, no?
No.

894
01:01:00,497 --> 01:01:02,291
Do it.
This is stupid.

895
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:04,877
Part of the job, man.

896
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:10,799
Fine.

897
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:15,596
Billy, please have a seat.
I need to talk to you for a minute.

898
01:01:15,596 --> 01:01:17,306
Go on.

899
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:20,726
You've been a huge part
of this team.

900
01:01:20,726 --> 01:01:23,687
But sometimes you have to
make decisions for the team.

901
01:01:23,687 --> 01:01:25,481
I'm sure you can understand.

902
01:01:25,481 --> 01:01:28,651
You're cutting me?
I'm really sorry.

903
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:30,986
I just bought a house here.

904
01:01:30,986 --> 01:01:32,821
Well...
In Oakland.

905
01:01:36,576 --> 01:01:38,160
Well, uh... Well...

906
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:41,580
"Well... Well..."?
That's all you got to say?

907
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:44,124
My kid just started
a new school.

908
01:01:44,124 --> 01:01:47,628
They made friends.
That's, uh...

909
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:51,006
You shouldn't pull them out
in the middle of the year.

910
01:01:51,006 --> 01:01:54,009
You should wait.
What the hell are you talking about?

911
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:56,011
I don't know. I shouldn't have--

912
01:01:56,011 --> 01:01:58,681
I'm not gonna do this.
I think this is stupid.

913
01:01:58,681 --> 01:02:02,017
I'm not gonna fire anybody,
and this is dumb.

914
01:02:03,103 --> 01:02:06,355
They're professional ballplayers.
Just be straight with them.

915
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,482
No fluff, just facts.

916
01:02:08,482 --> 01:02:13,487
Pete, I gotta let you go.
Jack's office will handle the details.

917
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:18,617
That's it?
Pfft.

918
01:02:18,827 --> 01:02:19,868
Really?

919
01:02:19,868 --> 01:02:24,456
You rather get a bullet to the head or
five to the chest and bleed to death?

920
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,711
Are those
my only two options?

921
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,046
Go on the road with the team.

922
01:02:33,675 --> 01:02:35,301
Okay.

923
01:02:44,644 --> 01:02:46,186
Say, bro.

924
01:02:46,186 --> 01:02:48,397
Let me ask you a question.
Yeah.

925
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:51,400
How come your boss
doesn't travel with the team?

926
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:56,864
He doesn't like to mingle
with the players.

927
01:02:58,658 --> 01:03:01,243
Is that supposed to
make us easier to cut?

928
01:03:06,458 --> 01:03:08,584
I don't know. I don't know.

929
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:13,589
And how come soda
is a dollar in the clubhouse?

930
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:16,008
I never seen
nothing like that.

931
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:20,095
Billy likes to keep
the money on the field.

932
01:03:20,095 --> 01:03:22,139
Soda money?

933
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,141
Really?

934
01:03:24,642 --> 01:03:28,062
Where on the field is the
dollar I'm paying for soda?

935
01:03:29,647 --> 01:03:33,108
It's hard to see exactly,

936
01:03:33,108 --> 01:03:36,236
but it's there, yeah.
Yeah, it is hard to see.

937
01:03:36,863 --> 01:03:38,447
I'm done.

938
01:03:49,584 --> 01:03:52,336
Hey, Dad.
Hi, honey.

939
01:03:52,336 --> 01:03:54,505
How are you?
I'm good.

940
01:03:54,505 --> 01:03:56,799
Was it bumpy?
It was okay.

941
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,929
So with this loss tonight,
the Oakland Athletics

942
01:04:01,929 --> 01:04:07,184
incredibly, have lost 14
of their last 17 games.

943
01:04:07,184 --> 01:04:10,437
They are 10 games back
in the American League West.

944
01:04:10,437 --> 01:04:13,107
Is it fair to say
the experiment has failed?

945
01:04:13,107 --> 01:04:15,609
Well, absolutely. It was predictable.

946
01:04:15,609 --> 01:04:20,239
You don't wish anybody a lack of success,
but the facts are in front of you.

947
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:22,241
You can't blame Art Howe.

948
01:04:22,241 --> 01:04:23,450
No.

949
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:27,746
The fact of the matter is, this is not
about statistics, this is about people.

950
01:04:27,746 --> 01:04:30,666
Art Howe is not the problem.

951
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:34,753
The problem is in the general
manager's office with Billy Beane.

952
01:04:34,753 --> 01:04:37,589
The root of the problem for me
is philosophical.

953
01:04:37,589 --> 01:04:39,925
I said it before.
This is fantasy baseball.

954
01:04:40,427 --> 01:04:41,885
Billy is just not thinking.

955
01:04:41,885 --> 01:04:44,680
Start thinking about a new ,
making changes.

956
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,432
He never goes to the games.

957
01:04:46,432 --> 01:04:48,058
This was very predictable.

958
01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:50,853
He needs to look at what's going on.

959
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:54,481
The man needs to get real.
I want Billy Beane gone.

960
01:04:54,481 --> 01:04:57,109
Calling for Beane's head.
I want your thoughts.

961
01:04:57,109 --> 01:05:02,489
The past 18 games, they've been
shut out or scored one run four times.

962
01:05:02,489 --> 01:05:04,366
They're just not scoring enough.

963
01:05:04,366 --> 01:05:07,703
It's not just the offense,
not Thad Bosley and the hitters.

964
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:12,166
It's everything. If there was one thing
you could pick out, you'd try to fix it,

965
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:17,671
but just everything is in a funk
right now.

966
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:24,845
What the hell am I doing?

967
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,183
Oh, man.

968
01:05:30,143 --> 01:05:32,144
Look, Steve.

969
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:37,816
I believe in what
we're doing.

970
01:05:37,816 --> 01:05:40,861
The record doesn't reflect
the strength of this team

971
01:05:40,861 --> 01:05:43,739
or where we're gonna be
at the end of the season.

972
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:48,535
Now, Pete and I here feel very strongly
that we stay on the track we've chosen.

973
01:05:48,535 --> 01:05:51,246
Our sample size has
been too small. It's too--

974
01:05:51,246 --> 01:05:53,081
Early. It's still early.

975
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:56,835
Where do we expect to be
by the All-Star break?

976
01:05:58,004 --> 01:06:00,506
Our goal
and our expectation

977
01:06:00,506 --> 01:06:04,426
is by mid-July to be within
seven games of first.

978
01:06:04,426 --> 01:06:06,053
That would be
this working.

979
01:06:06,053 --> 01:06:08,722
That keeps us in the hunt.
Exceptionally well.

980
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:12,142
By July.
July.

981
01:06:12,142 --> 01:06:16,188
And what's gonna prevent you
from accomplishing that?

982
01:06:16,188 --> 01:06:18,023
What are you afraid of?

983
01:06:18,023 --> 01:06:21,109
Nothing. That's why
we're here, Steve.

984
01:06:21,109 --> 01:06:24,613
That's why we get up in the
morning. That's all we do.

985
01:06:44,175 --> 01:06:45,717
More?
Yeah, a little more.

986
01:06:45,717 --> 01:06:49,346
Don't tell your mother.
I won't.

987
01:06:50,098 --> 01:06:52,224
Chocolate sauce?
Yes.

988
01:06:53,059 --> 01:06:54,476
Stop.

989
01:06:57,063 --> 01:07:00,023
Big spoon or little spoon?
Little spoon.

990
01:07:01,401 --> 01:07:03,068
Thank you.

991
01:07:12,745 --> 01:07:15,581
Dad, there's no way you're
gonna lose your job, right?

992
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:16,790
What?

993
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:19,459
Well, I don't know.

994
01:07:19,459 --> 01:07:21,712
I'm just wondering.
Where'd you hear that?

995
01:07:21,712 --> 01:07:23,839
Well, I go on the Internet
sometimes.

996
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:27,175
Well, don't do that.
Don't go on the Internet.

997
01:07:27,175 --> 01:07:30,178
Or watch
or read newspapers

998
01:07:30,972 --> 01:07:32,889
or talk to people.

999
01:07:32,889 --> 01:07:35,726
I don't talk to people.
I just read stuff.

1000
01:07:35,726 --> 01:07:38,520
Honey, everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

1001
01:07:39,272 --> 01:07:41,148
Really, you don't have to worry.

1002
01:07:41,148 --> 01:07:44,693
But if you lose your job,
will you have to move away?

1003
01:07:45,445 --> 01:07:47,863
Honey, I'm not gonna
lose my job.

1004
01:07:49,282 --> 01:07:51,283
You don't have to worry.

1005
01:07:53,661 --> 01:07:56,038
Okay.
Hey.

1006
01:07:56,623 --> 01:08:00,000
There's no problem.
Okay.

1007
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,503
All right? I got uptown problems,
which are not problems at all.

1008
01:08:04,505 --> 01:08:05,881
You're not worried, right?

1009
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:08,550
No, I'm not worried.
Okay.

1010
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:17,517
Pena.

1011
01:08:20,188 --> 01:08:21,813
Okay.

1012
01:08:34,619 --> 01:08:36,745
I want Dye in right,

1013
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:39,748
Justice 'ing,
Pena on the bench,

1014
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:41,708
Hatteberg at first,

1015
01:08:41,708 --> 01:08:44,920
and anyone but Mags
first out of the pen.

1016
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,005
You want Pena on the bench?

1017
01:08:47,005 --> 01:08:50,300
That's right.
So you can play Hattie.

1018
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,719
Pena is not only
the best first baseman,

1019
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:55,055
he's the only first baseman.

1020
01:08:55,055 --> 01:08:57,599
Hattie gets on base
more than Pena.

1021
01:08:57,599 --> 01:09:00,268
In fact, 20 percent more.
And his fielding?

1022
01:09:00,268 --> 01:09:03,105
His fielding does not matter.

1023
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:06,358
I've heard enough of this.
Have you?

1024
01:09:06,358 --> 01:09:08,110
And I, uh...

1025
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:11,947
I disagree with you,
plain and simple.

1026
01:09:12,865 --> 01:09:15,033
And moreover,
I'm playing my team

1027
01:09:15,535 --> 01:09:19,204
in a way that I can explain
in job interviews next winter.

1028
01:09:20,123 --> 01:09:21,790
Okay? Ahem.
