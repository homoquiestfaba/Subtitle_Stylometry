1
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,920
Alright, I'm going to
spray some rosewater.

2
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,521
Okay, take a deep breath.

3
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:39,298
Take your time getting up.
Let's have some water okay?

4
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,899
Thank you.

5
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:45,871
Um, Abby? Will you marry me?

6
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:47,940
Ha ha.

7
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,898
The upstairs toilet
is acting funny.

8
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,566
What?

9
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:17,736
Upstairs toilet is acting funny.

10
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:19,805
Oh.

11
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,608
Have you noticed?

12
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,177
No, I guess I haven't
really noticed.

13
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:37,523
It was making a running
sound like even,

14
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:41,593
even when it wasn't, just
when it was not in use.

15
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,195
And then it would stop.

16
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:47,065
Okay, well did you
look in the back.

17
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:49,201
Like did you look in
the tank of the toilet?

18
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:51,270
Mm-mm.

19
00:02:55,842 --> 00:03:03,815
Sometimes the chain just falls
off. And you just reattach it.

20
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,651
Is there, is there
anything that I, I can...

21
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:10,355
No, everything is
everything's under to control.

22
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,424
Okay then.

23
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:21,133
I'll get it.

24
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:30,642
Hey Paul Hey Good to see you.

25
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:40,586
Yeah, I beat my record, by like
two minutes. Oooo...Ah man.

26
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:43,155
Is everybody in the kitchen?

27
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,860
Are you out of your mind?

28
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,363
A calzone is not the
same as a hot pocket.

29
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,598
Ok, what's the difference then?

30
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,632
There's a huge difference.

31
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:54,700
Okay, what's the difference?

32
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:56,235
Ok, you've got your
tomato -based filling

33
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,837
and you've got your
pastry based outer shell.

34
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,406
Hold on, have you ever
even had a calzone?

35
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,478
I got a pizza and I flipped it
over and I called it calzone.

36
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,114
You know what we're going to do?
I'm going to make you a calzone.

37
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,148
Okay.

38
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,183
And you're going to eat it

39
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,951
and then I'm going
to prove you wrong

40
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,620
and you're gonna owe me.

41
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:16,688
Okay. Deal.

42
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,423
What do you owe me?

43
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,691
I don't know.
What's he gonna owe me?

44
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,760
What should I owe her?

45
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,428
I don't know.

46
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,200
How bout...How bout a beer.

47
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,268
Okay.

48
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:35,274
And if it turns out to be
like a DiGiorno's Pizza,

49
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,175
just folded over and
thrown in the oven,

50
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,110
what do I get out of it?

51
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,478
Well, I mean, regardless

52
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,813
you're gonna get a delicious
homemade treat so.

53
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,783
What? The calzone?
That's the treat?

54
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,253
Oh, God. Okay. And what
happens if I don't like it?

55
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,555
Then what do I get
out of it? Nothin.

56
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:53,025
That's just, that's
just not possible.

57
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:54,192
A homemade treat.

58
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,761
I'm back!

59
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:00,432
Hello.
Hi.

60
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:02,567
Smells good!
Mm-mm.

61
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:08,373
Hey baby. I remembered
the salad dressing.

62
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:10,575
Why didn't you make the
one that you make? The one...

63
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,144
I didn't have any time.

64
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:15,247
Just tell me next time
and I'll make it.

65
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:16,982
Well, then you would
know my secret recipe.

66
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:18,717
Oh, oh I didn't realize.

67
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,852
The stew smells
amazing. What is that?

68
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,688
Like cinnamon?
Smells so good.

69
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,790
Will you take this?

70
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:27,059
What is that?
Beef beef stew.

71
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,694
I know, but what's that smell?

72
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:33,365
Clove?
It's just beef.

73
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:38,270
So, did you get the mac?
The applications?

74
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,706
I didn't send them.

75
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,108
Are you serious?

76
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,776
Yeah, I'm serious.

77
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,645
What the fuck! Why?

78
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,213
What the fuck?
Give me a break.

79
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:51,216
What do you mean,
give you a break?

80
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:53,118
Why didn't you send them?

81
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,420
It's like a really bad time.

82
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,488
It's a great time.

83
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,323
No, it's not a great time.

84
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,258
Why?

85
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,761
We can barely pay Susan, okay.

86
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,463
What does that mean?

87
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,597
What do you mean,
what does it mean?

88
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,766
It means we haven't
had a new client

89
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,669
in forever and all of
Grandpa's clients are dying off.

90
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,504
Yeah, but that's
not your problem.

91
00:06:12,506 --> 00:06:14,239
Yeah, well that's really
easy for you to say.

92
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,607
Yeah it is easy for me to say.

93
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,610
And it's easy for
you to say too.

94
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,645
You don't get it.

95
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:27,586
Look, I love you. It's
your life. It's your life.

96
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:29,287
I have to go to the bathroom.

97
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:36,294
Check these tomatoes, or does
it matter? It doesn't matter.

98
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,463
Dad, will you get
the ah, cornbread?

99
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,712
Hey.
Hey.

100
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,955
Yeah. I think it's an
incredibly good idea.

101
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,258
Are you sure?
Yeah.

102
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,424
You look wan.

103
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,527
Wan?
Hm-mm.

104
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:44,830
Are you sleeping? You've
got bags. You're all puffy.

105
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,098
Yeah, I'm sleeping.

106
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,101
I should have Bronwen
make an elixir for him.

107
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:53,472
I have a friend who makes
these incredible energy tonics

108
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,073
that stimulate everything.

109
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,275
Your liver, your
gallbladder, you kidney's...

110
00:07:57,277 --> 00:08:00,979
I don't, I don't think that
elixirs are dad's thing.

111
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,082
Well, maybe not... What
does it taste like?

112
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,150
It tastes like shit.

113
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:08,620
Garbage, but so good for
you. Cleansing, healing.

114
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,957
Bronwen's amazing.

115
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,792
She did Reiki on me last
month, it was incredible.

116
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:16,695
Right.
Mm-mm.

117
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:21,766
You should get Reiki done.
Paul, you would love Reiki.

118
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:25,203
And, what's Reiki?
I mean, what is it?

119
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,172
It's energy work essentially.

120
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:32,177
It helps you release emotional
blockages and clear out pathways

121
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:38,950
and just makes you feel
awesome in general.

122
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,519
Okay.

123
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,823
Paul, how's the practice doing?

124
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,058
Great.

125
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,129
Yeah? Business is booming?

126
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,232
Yeah, we're trucking
along and...

127
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:58,403
Good. Awesome.

128
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:02,474
How's the um, the
apartment search going?

129
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:03,441
Good.

130
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,943
Have you found anything?

131
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,078
Not yet, but I have a few leads.

132
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,481
You have to be out by the first.

133
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:10,649
I know, I know, I know.

134
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:14,219
Well, why don't you
just move in with me?

135
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,126
Well, I mean you're at
my house every night.

136
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:22,260
Well, it's not every night.

137
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,830
I mean, rents really high
right now, you know.

138
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:29,868
I mean, it just makes sense.

139
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,239
Or, you could move in here

140
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:40,745
until you find a place
that's suitable.

141
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:46,585
There's plenty of room, the
door's always open to you.

142
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:53,191
Thank you brother. That is a
very generous offer Paul um...

143
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,759
Thank you.

144
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,496
I mean it makes sense right?

145
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:01,032
That's what I'm saying. Right?

146
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,336
Yeah, I mean, you're
going to regret it though,

147
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,471
because I'm a complete
and utter slob.

148
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,772
Like I already don't know that.

149
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,576
I know but once all my
stuff is there. Alright.

150
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:12,544
So you'll move in.

151
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:13,712
Yeah.
That's great.

152
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:14,713
Why not.

153
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,381
And you guys can have
dinner at our house.

154
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,479
And a little tap, tap, tap.

155
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,949
Close and grind and move
side to side for me.

156
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,517
Perfect.

157
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,988
And tap, tap, tap.
One, two, three.

158
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,558
Hold and close, grind
side to side. Perfect.

159
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,193
Alright.

160
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,499
Mirror.

161
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:21,179
let's just take a look and
see what we've got here.

162
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,747
Uh-huh.

163
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,785
Okay, Mrs Olstead,
be sure to floss.

164
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,758
We'll see you next time.

165
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:39,764
Who's next?

166
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:44,836
Um, no one today.
Mrs. Koppleson canceled.

167
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,590
Dad?

168
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:09,828
Yeah, I was thinking, um.

169
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,131
I think we need some new blood.

170
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,000
We could, could advertise.

171
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:19,370
That's not, that's
too expensive.

172
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:24,309
We have to, we have to spend
money to make money right?

173
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:28,613
I could call, I could do, I
could do some research.

174
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:31,649
Who would you call?
I don't know.

175
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:34,753
Look at bus ads or call
some newspapers...

176
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,323
I'm not comfortable with that.

177
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,196
Okay.

178
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,296
You feel good.

179
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,066
Yeah?
Mm-mm.

180
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,771
Ah, it's amazing.

181
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:37,415
Ah. So, what are his ah? What
are your brother's symptoms?

182
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:44,722
Oh um, he's really uptight,

183
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:47,158
Take this.
Thank you.

184
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,462
Judgemental, he's rigid and.

185
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:52,831
I don't want a
character assasination,

186
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,766
I just want his symptoms.

187
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:59,938
Oh. He's um, he's
really ah, depleted.

188
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,406
His like energy is gone.

189
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:06,711
He's all sucked in and wan
and he's not sleeping good.

190
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,479
Okay, I'll give
him a liver tonic

191
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:11,316
and something for
his gallbladder.

192
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,317
Okay.

193
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:17,155
Alright. That's not going
to happen but alright.

194
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:21,059
He really should. I can help
him better if he's here.

195
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,760
How about you?
How are you doing?

196
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:29,300
You feel good, so
things are good. What?

197
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,403
Jesse asked me to
move in with him.

198
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:38,476
Yeah, last night in front
of my family at dinner.

199
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,511
Wow.
Yeah.

200
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,547
Wow.
What the F right?

201
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:47,418
No joke that's. Did
you...are you...you're...

202
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,687
Yeah, I don't know.

203
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:50,955
Yes, good, good.
I'm flipping out about it.

204
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:54,859
You wouldn't be you if you
didn't flip out about it.

205
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,961
Its great, it's fine, it's
normal, it's normal.

206
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:57,962
Really?

207
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:02,033
I mean, he was supposed to
be my rebound. You know.

208
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,034
Yeah.

209
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,569
Just my get back
in the game guy.

210
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:08,640
Isn't it awful. Something
beautiful happened.

211
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:09,641
Is it?

212
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,175
It actually have ...is it?

213
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,579
I dont' know. Is it being tied
down again going to be awesome?

214
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:18,917
Or is it going to be
like a cage and like...

215
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:22,587
No, honey. I keep telling you,
I have always told you,

216
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,925
you have something
that, yes started sexually.

217
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,994
And it's grown into
something beautiful.

218
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,763
And that's what happen
for me and Charlie,

219
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,531
we started out
that way and that

220
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:37,268
was the most meaningful
relationship of my entire life.

221
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,139
And you know what,

222
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:46,377
I didn't even appreciate
what I had until Charlie past.

223
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,814
It wasn't until after. And I, I,

224
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,883
I just don't want
you to fuck it up.

225
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:54,752
I don't want you
to fuck it up.

226
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,921
Alright.

227
00:15:56,923 --> 00:16:00,959
Just appreciate it. Ok.

228
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,427
Alright, cheers.
Gratitude.

229
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,695
Gratitude. Appreciate.

230
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,530
What time's your first victim?

231
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:09,334
Um...Oh, ten minutes ago.

232
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,436
Here take these. Take these.
I mixed these for you.

233
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,104
This is my special blend,
very proud of that.

234
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:15,139
I'll bring the tonic
down later, okay.

235
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:17,542
Oh, and I will put your
check in the box.

236
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,277
Oh yeah! Two months.

237
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,312
I know, two months, I'm sorry.

238
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,681
Can I help you?

239
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:57,982
Um, yeah, Jenny sent me.

240
00:16:57,984 --> 00:17:00,718
She said I could get
a free cleaning.

241
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,388
Oh, ah, Okay. Um, Jenny...

242
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,823
Oh, Henry, you came.

243
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:09,260
Yeah, it's okay. Come back.

244
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,499
Okay, you ready? Open up.

245
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,200
What, what, what are you doing?

246
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,403
Oh hey dad.
This is Henry.

247
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:22,106
He ah, we know each
other from Cafe Fiore.

248
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:26,811
Hello.
Hello.

249
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,279
You know each other how?

250
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,914
Oh, I work there.

251
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,582
He makes my coffee
every morning.

252
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:34,585
Yeah, I just figured that
the chair was empty,

253
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,588
so I'd just give
him quick polish.

254
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,490
What do you mean?

255
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,726
Well, I didn't want to bother
you, you know. He's my friend,

256
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:45,730
He hasn't had a
cleaning in, in awhile.

257
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,465
That's not right.

258
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,734
What do you mean?

259
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,838
You don't have the training.

260
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,076
I've seen you do it
like a thousand times.

261
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:04,215
Well, I think it'd be better
if you stayed on your side.

262
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,518
Don't you?

263
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,668
So, when was the last
time you saw a Dentist?

264
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,603
About five years ago.

265
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,171
Oh, well, you're due.

266
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,843
Ah, G3.

267
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,648
The mirror.

268
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:49,927
Okay, let's open up
and take a look.

269
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,998
Alright, what have we
got going on here?

270
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,260
I'm going to start
you face down,

271
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:25,796
under the top sheet and ah,

272
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,298
you can hang your things here.

273
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,534
I'll see you in a second.
Alright thanks.

274
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,990
Is it warm enough in here?

275
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:28,025
It feels nice.

276
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,701
I start with lite
pressure at first okay,

277
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,603
and you tell me if you
want me to adjust it.

278
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,171
Okay.

279
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:26,951
Hey.

280
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,053
Hey.

281
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,656
How's it going?

282
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:33,891
Okay.

283
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,559
How's your day?

284
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:36,794
Shitty.

285
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,830
Well, why don't you
come over here

286
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,299
and I'll give you a back rub.

287
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:46,570
Oh. that sounds nice.

288
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:49,273
Oh, it's tempting. But ah,

289
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,842
I have so much packing to do.

290
00:21:54,946 --> 00:22:02,353
Oh, okay. Um, I'll see
you tomorrow then?

291
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:03,921
Yeah.

292
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,559
You okay?

293
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:14,231
Yeah, yeah, I'm
okay. I'm just ah,

294
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:21,305
I don't know. I'm
just in a funky mood.

295
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:25,109
I'll call you in
the morning okay?

296
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,011
Call me when you get up.

297
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:29,547
I will.

298
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:34,051
I love you.
Me too.

299
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,721
Bye.
Alright. G'night.

300
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:44,729
E3.

301
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:46,297
Dad, he's like totally
freaking out.

302
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,832
Mirror.
He loves you.

303
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,433
He says you cured him.

304
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:51,902
Cured him of what?

305
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,207
Well, he had this horrible
pain. It was in his jaw.

306
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,075
TMJ?
Yeah.

307
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,845
Temporomandibular
Joint disorder.

308
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:04,749
Right, right. It was so bad
that he had to stop singing.

309
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,952
Since he's left office
and he's had no pain.

310
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:13,691
My grand-daughter has TMJ.
Maybe you could cure her.

311
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:16,160
Well, that's doubtful Mrs Olsen.

312
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:20,398
But if she comes in, I'd
be happy to take a look.

313
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,069
Let's open please. Alright.

314
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,712
Oh... I hate to disappoint
you, but if you came

315
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:46,016
here hoping that I could somehow
magically take away your pain,

316
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:48,519
I can't do that.

317
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:52,356
Okay. I understand.

318
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:56,527
Do you?
Yes.

319
00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:01,365
Just do whatever you did for
the last guy. The guy you cured.

320
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:04,268
I, I didn't cure him.

321
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,071
Okay.

322
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:10,074
Just so long as you understand.

323
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:11,642
Okay.

324
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:21,352
Okay, and open, and...

325
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,858
Mr...

326
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,801
What happened?

327
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,870
Word of mouth.

328
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,211
Mr. Harris?

329
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,563
Hi, this is Abby. Due to some
unforeseen circumstances,

330
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:40,864
I will not be seeing any

331
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:45,736
clients for the time being. I'm
sorry for any inconvenience that

332
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:51,909
this causes anybody and ah, I
hope to be back soon. Namaste.

333
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,186
And Abby came running in here,

334
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:07,424
Grandpa Douglas had just
mixed a batch of this...

335
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:10,594
and everywhere it
was all over his face.

336
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:15,299
I was sitting right where you
are and giggling and I mean ...

337
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:19,637
Oh my gosh, Look
what else came.

338
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:22,473
Look what you are
doing for people.

339
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:23,674
I dont', I don't understand it.

340
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:27,945
It's not like I'm doing
anything differently.

341
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,980
Henry's singing again.

342
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,450
Well, that that's great, but
I'm not responsible for that.

343
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,519
He thinks you are.

344
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,062
Alright.

345
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,901
To my favorite Dentist.

346
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,842
Family dentistry.

347
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,478
I'm going to take the
car out for a bit.

348
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:17,294
Oh, hey Henry.
Hey Jenny.

349
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:19,196
Did you come back
to see my dad again?

350
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:22,132
Um, well, both of you actually.

351
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:25,269
I um, wanted to give you
tickets to my show.

352
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:28,038
Oh, oh wow, thank you.

353
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,076
Um, it wouldn't be happening
if it weren't for your dad.

354
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:34,945
That's incredible. Thanks.

355
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:38,248
No, it's just a little invite
only thing. It's no big deal.

356
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,118
No, that's cool. We'll
definitely, definitely come.

357
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,390
Cool um, I ah, I
made this for you.

358
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,025
Oh, is this your music?

359
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:54,565
No, it's just some songs
that I thought you'd like.

360
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,501
Thank you.
You're welcome.

361
00:28:57,503 --> 00:29:03,107
That's so, that's
really sweet. Thanks.

362
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:07,344
Um, I gotta go, but I, I'm
really looking forward to this.

363
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:08,145
Cool.

364
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:09,847
Thank you.

365
00:29:09,849 --> 00:29:11,915
See you there.

366
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:33,704
Brandon said he's
headed down to Galway.

367
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:36,840
Craking, Galway,
it's the same thing.

368
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:38,242
He's really heading
down there...

369
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:42,479
Hey, Jesse.
Jenny, hey.

370
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:43,447
Hey.

371
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,350
I'm good. I'm doing good.

372
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,018
Is that the

373
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:53,223
it's, well it's ah, it's
not a hot pocket.

374
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,360
Wow, that, that is
not a hot pocket.

375
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,996
God, you really
didn't didn't need

376
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:01,131
I know, but I was, I
was, I was gonna,

377
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,566
you know I was
gonna do it anyway

378
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:04,802
because I, well, I love to cook

379
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:08,071
and the conversation
sort of inspired it, so.

380
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:13,110
God this smells great.
I mean, I feel

381
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:16,446
No, no don't feel, I
mean it was, it's nothing.

382
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:21,051
It's totally not
anything you know. Um,

383
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:25,789
Thank you
I'll see you.

384
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:32,429
Yeah, um. Hey Jenny,
thanks, this is really nice.

385
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:11,735
Abby, what?

386
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:12,669
Will you do me a favor?

387
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:15,639
Are you ok?
Yeah, I'm good.

388
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,708
Will you take your shirt off?

389
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:31,555
What?

390
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:39,463
Will you kiss me?

391
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:42,299
What?

392
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,534
Will you kiss me?

393
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,419
What the fuck?

394
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,654
Abby!

395
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:29,346
Hey, Reiki. What is Reiki?
That's what Abby's friend does.

396
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:52,502
And um, how long have
you had this pain?

397
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:56,406
Oh, for like, ever. That's
what if feels like at least.

398
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:58,742
Well it started in a
kind of on and off way.

399
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:02,879
Um, I was still working on the
boat, so it was before 1998.

400
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,614
Right, right.

401
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:09,152
And um, then it
started to get real bad.

402
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,955
And it's right um,
right in here?

403
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:13,490
It's both sides.
Both sides.

404
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,725
Both sides hurts.

405
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:19,763
So that was before 1998 when
it started and then ah...

406
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,172
And after 1998?

407
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:32,776
Yeah ah, is started
getting really bad,

408
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,144
really persistent all the time.

409
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:37,748
You know, and um. So that
was like when I got divorced,

410
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,451
so that was back in like 2005.

411
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,620
2005

412
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:47,524
Thanks for seeing me.
I've heard great things.

413
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,960
Well, let's let's not get
our hopes up too high,

414
00:33:49,962 --> 00:33:52,062
but ah, we'll see
what we can do.

415
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:36,139
Wow. Okay, what's
going on with you?

416
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:39,242
I don't, I don't know.

417
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:43,046
You're energy is, just
completely waperjaw.

418
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,088
I just, I don't know,
I don't know,

419
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,224
I don't know. I just,
I feel really weird.

420
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:57,260
Everything is weird,
I don't know.

421
00:34:57,262 --> 00:35:04,734
Yeah, I just. I,
I just, I feel off.

422
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:06,236
Well, you're energy is off.

423
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:15,679
It's completely all over the
place and incredibly fearful.

424
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:18,849
I feel like I can't,

425
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:21,718
I don't know You can't?

426
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,255
With everything I can't.
Like with Jesse I can't.

427
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:28,058
I don't want him to
touch me, I can't connect.

428
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:32,362
I don't know how to, I don't
know, is there something?

429
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:35,799
Yeah. Too much here.

430
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,236
When's the last time you guys
just went out and you know...

431
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:44,774
when's the last time you
went dancing? Hiking?

432
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:52,215
I don't know. I can't I just.
I need you to fix me please.

433
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:53,617
You can fix yourself.

434
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,418
I can't.

435
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,387
Maybe you need
physiological trigger.

436
00:35:57,389 --> 00:36:00,590
Have you ever tried MDMA?

437
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:07,197
Oh yeah. It's like a big deal in
certain psychotherapy circles.

438
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,732
Are you fucking
with me right now?

439
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:11,334
No. Charlie and I tried it.

440
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:16,139
We did it. It was a
great way for us to...

441
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:20,277
reconnect. What?

442
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:26,016
I, I just don't know
where I would even get it.

443
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,084
Hold on.

444
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,092
Wow.

445
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,370
I haven't looked there
since... anyway.

446
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,373
One for you, one for Jesse.

447
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,176
Think of it as a hall pass.

448
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,711
Permission slip to just let

449
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,248
go of your fear and
embrace the world.

450
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,122
Or not.

451
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,246
Oh my God! I'm such a jerk,
I'm so sorry, I am so late.

452
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,780
Ah, that looks amazing.

453
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:34,718
Oh Bronwen had a cancellation
and I just tried to sneak in

454
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,019
and it just went way over.

455
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:39,256
Um, but I think she
had a really great idea.

456
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:43,093
What's that?
Look what she gave me.

457
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,295
What is that?

458
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,765
Ecstasy.

459
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:55,171
Ecstasy? A-awesome.

460
00:37:55,173 --> 00:37:57,941
Yeah, I know! I thought it could
be really good for us right now.

461
00:37:57,943 --> 00:38:01,111
Um, I kind of want to do it
before Paul and Jenny gets here,

462
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:02,979
but we should probably
wait to do it til they leave.

463
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:06,049
Probably.

464
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:07,384
What's wrong.

465
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:12,022
Nothing um, ecstasy huh?

466
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:13,923
What do you think?

467
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:17,661
Abby, I think you're acting a
little bit nuts is what I think.

468
00:38:17,663 --> 00:38:18,762
Why?

469
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,163
We haven't even had a
chance to talk about

470
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:21,364
what happened yesterday
at the shop.

471
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:25,335
Yeah, I know I just
I Wh-what was that?

472
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:27,937
You come in then you take off
and then you just leave?

473
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:28,738
Yeah.

474
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,908
Imagine how that made me feel.

475
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,911
taking drugs right now
is what we need to do?

476
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,546
I mean, I think that's the last
thing that we need to do.

477
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:38,014
I think we need to stop and and

478
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,617
and get real with each
other for a second.

479
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:42,018
I'm being real with you.

480
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,354
Abby, you're an hour and
a half late for a dinner

481
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:47,023
that I've been cooking for your
family, which is totally fine

482
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:50,727
But then you waltz in here with
drugs in your hand and and..

483
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:54,197
I'm sorry it may be me, but
it feels a little bit weird.

484
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,633
I don't know, I just
thought it would be...

485
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:58,134
What, you need to
take some sort of,

486
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:01,371
you know, drugs,
to be with me?

487
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:04,774
No, no, God, no. I just
thought it would be fun

488
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,576
I'm just saying like,

489
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:09,212
you're just acting a
little bit different.

490
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,347
I know.

491
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:13,049
And is there something
going on with you? I mean?

492
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:18,054
Yeah. I just wanted to do
something that might be fun.

493
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,522
I don't know.
It was stupid.

494
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,624
So stupid, it was
stupid. Stupid idea..

495
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:26,529
No it's not stupid. I just
caught me off guard and and..

496
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,065
okay, they're here.

497
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,735
You know, just forget I
said anything about it.

498
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:32,669
It's stupid.

499
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:41,077
No, it it's... ecstasy.

500
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:44,748
Hey guys. Yay salad,
thank you, Come on in.

501
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,317
Here's some wine.
Thanks

502
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:51,755
You guys find a seat.

503
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:53,456
It's kind of
incredible actually.

504
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:57,026
I mean, you're like
changing lives.

505
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:01,030
Yeah you are. Yeah,
Henry, he's gonna,

506
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:04,367
he hasn't performed
in like two years.

507
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,569
I mean that's because of you.

508
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,873
You should feel really
really good about that.

509
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,609
That's great Paul.

510
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:13,676
Yeah.

511
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:20,817
Jesse's organizing a 30mile
urban bike race downtown.

512
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:22,819
Oh, c'mon.
You are.

513
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,922
It's a bike ride, bike ride.
It's not a race.

514
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:26,990
I thought it was like a race.

515
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,825
No, it's like a group ride.

516
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:30,860
Oh group ride.
Yeah.

517
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:32,162
That sounds really
cool actually.

518
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:34,264
And what's the point?

519
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,703
Fun.

520
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:47,544
Can you pass your plate please?

521
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:49,646
That was really really good.
Thank you.

522
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:52,182
It was really delicious.
Thank you.

523
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:59,088
How is it being
roomies you guys?

524
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:03,993
Um, I'll let you know when
I, when I finish packing.

525
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:05,361
Someone's being lazy.

526
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:05,962
Yeah.

527
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:06,963
You're not moving in?

528
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,466
I am moving in.

529
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:14,270
This weekend we're gonna
tackle it. Just been busy.

530
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:17,841
Oh Paul, I got you that
elixir from Bronwen.

531
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:20,076
She said she wanted
to see you in person,

532
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:23,713
but I told her that was
probably never gonna happen.

533
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:24,814
Why'd you say that?

534
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,484
Because you said
you'd, I don't know.

535
00:41:27,486 --> 00:41:31,688
Here. Her tonic.
Knock yourself out.

536
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,761
What are these?

537
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:45,068
Ecstasy.

538
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:48,771
What? Are you taking that?

539
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:50,707
Ah, yeah.

540
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,909
Why are you taking ecstasy?

541
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:54,878
It's a hug drug Paul.

542
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,181
I'm addicted. I'm actually
a fucking drug addict,

543
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:03,386
I wanted to tell you about it.
Who wants dessert?

544
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:04,621
Cheesy pudding.

545
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,397
That tofu was so, I don't
usually like tofu and I just...

546
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:20,036
Oh thanks. I cooked it in like
really special olive oil. So.

547
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:34,017
Welcome.
Thank you.

548
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:38,555
So did you have a particular
goal in mind for today?

549
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:42,425
Um, no. Just, I'm curious.

550
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:43,960
Okay.

551
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:51,701
You know Abby, my sister,
she, said that it's amazing.

552
00:42:51,703 --> 00:42:54,938
I think it is. I think
you're going really enjoy it.

553
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,306
So why don't we just
get started into

554
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:58,007
the session and see
where it takes us.

555
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:00,209
Okay.
Okay.

556
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,345
I'll take your coat for you.

557
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,316
How's the temperature
feel in here? Okay?

558
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:07,383
In here?
Yeah.

559
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:08,685
Um, it's good.

560
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:19,329
Oh. You don't need to remove
your clothes for Reiki.

561
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:20,663
I'm sorry.

562
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:22,098
No, it's fine.
Sorry. No.

563
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,766
No, you know what you're
actually if you would,

564
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:24,667
if you are more comfortable

565
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:26,703
I'd love you to remove
your clothes.

566
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:30,006
I mean if you want to,
if you feel comfortable.

567
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:31,541
No.

568
00:43:31,543 --> 00:43:34,210
Okay, so if you want
to just climb up here

569
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:38,448
and get comfortable
with your head this way.

570
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,754
Oh, wow, okay.

571
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:47,323
That's the most interesting
way anyone's ever gotten

572
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:50,126
on my Reiki table before.

573
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:50,960
Okay. Just put my head up there.

574
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,195
Yes.

575
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:54,964
Okay.

576
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,105
I, that looks actually
really comfortable,

577
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:03,339
but I should have
been more specific.

578
00:44:03,341 --> 00:44:04,941
I meant on your, if
you can get on your

579
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:06,342
back with your head up here.

580
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:07,977
Oh, okay.
Perfect.

581
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:08,678
Like that?
Yes.

582
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,913
Okay. Is that good?

583
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:12,682
That's perfect. Just lie,
if you let your feet,

584
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:14,751
your legs lie flat
on the table.

585
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:16,986
Yeah. Just to completely
let your legs fall

586
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,122
where they, let your feet fall

587
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:20,556
Like that.
Just absolutely relax.

588
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:24,927
Let every muscle just
relax. Your hands.

589
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:25,828
Okay.

590
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,830
Just resting comfortably
at your side.

591
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,532
Alright Yeah, just
get comfortable

592
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:33,369
Alright.
Everything's fine, this is good.

593
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:37,874
Maybe you should picture
yourself someplace

594
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:40,376
where you feel the
most comfortable.

595
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:43,212
The place where you feel safe,

596
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:47,750
the place where you feel
happy. You picture that.

597
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:50,520
The office, like at my office.

598
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,522
Your office?

599
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:56,426
Um, maybe we should
try to get out

600
00:44:56,428 --> 00:44:59,996
of the office and
go to the beach

601
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:03,599
and sit on the sand and feel
the warm sun on your skin.

602
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:07,103
I'd rather, I'd rather
be at the office.

603
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:08,404
Okay, great.

604
00:45:08,406 --> 00:45:12,308
So is there a favorite chair in
your office? Or a favorite...

605
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,944
I like the back
room The back room

606
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:16,045
where I look at x-ray's

607
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,346
where you look at x-ray's, okay.

608
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:23,386
Well, you look at x-rays in your
back room and I will do Reiki.

609
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:28,324
Okay. Just get in your back
room and close your eyes.

610
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,534
Are you're eyes closed?

611
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:39,769
Yep.

612
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,681
Huh. Okay. Wow.

613
00:45:51,683 --> 00:45:53,049
Are you alright?

614
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:54,117
That was, that was great.

615
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:58,488
Uh-hum. Nah. I just want to
know um, what it's about.

616
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:02,058
Yeah. Like how you're
doing, what are you?

617
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,092
How are you doing it?

618
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:07,363
How, how how are you
doing it? What are you

619
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:10,767
Well, do you want to
learn how to do Reiki?

620
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:12,835
Yes.

621
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:15,438
Because I can, I mean, I can
show you how. I can teach you.

622
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,706
Great. Great.

623
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:21,344
I can, but it is energy work,
you know that don't you.

624
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:23,045
Are you aware that
it's energy work.

625
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:25,181
Energy.

626
00:46:25,183 --> 00:46:27,283
And I channel energy into you

627
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:30,386
to help you balance
your energy and.

628
00:46:30,388 --> 00:46:32,221
You know what, why
don't we just for today,

629
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:34,423
why don't I work on you and
you can feel what it feels like

630
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:36,492
and then we can
meet another time

631
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:41,397
and I can explain
everything to do with Reiki.

632
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:45,601
You could even be a Reiki
master if you wanted to be.

633
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:47,170
Is that what you want.

634
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:52,175
You could be a Reiki master!

635
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:53,109
How's that sound?

636
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:54,443
It sounds good.

637
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:57,180
Okay. So, get back
in your office.

638
00:46:57,182 --> 00:46:59,415
Okay. Alright.

639
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:02,518
Okay. Oh, good.
Scooch down a little bit.

640
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,386
Okay.
That's perfect.

641
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:04,720
Is that good?
Yes.

642
00:47:04,722 --> 00:47:05,755
Alright. Okay? Ready?
Here we go.

643
00:47:05,757 --> 00:47:07,757
Okay.
Let's go.

644
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:22,405
Pop your legs up on the
couch. Just cross them over.

645
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:25,041
Can you get that up there?

646
00:47:25,043 --> 00:47:32,148
Stay still, stay still. Just
don't let go. Don't let go.

647
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:37,620
Just relax down a little bit.

648
00:47:37,622 --> 00:47:39,188
Good, see, you're
okay, I've got you.

649
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,825
You're, you're
safe. You're okay.

650
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,329
You know what? Put your
legs down on the floor.

651
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:47,964
Just put them down on
the floor, that's better.

652
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,498
And onto the next position,

653
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,236
just put them over the
heart, above the breast.

654
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:05,314
Okay, move down onto the lower
abdomen, yeah, right down there.

655
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,932
So what we're gonna do
Dillon, in the first step is

656
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:26,068
we're just going to
put some articulate...

657
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,137
Are you ready?

658
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:33,342
Alright.

659
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,780
One, two, three...

660
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,517
How's that feel?

661
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,586
Can you...Better?

662
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,525
I think it is.

663
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,870
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

664
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:05,408
Thank you
Oh you're welcome.

665
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,443
Thank you.
You're welcome.

666
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:37,740
I felt something.
Did you feel something?

667
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,166
Come on in.

668
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,193
See how that is.

669
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,130
Good.

670
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,268
Looks good.

671
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,037
Thank you.

672
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,777
I went to Bronwen.

673
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:55,878
What do you mean?

674
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,680
I, I went.

675
00:51:57,682 --> 00:52:00,516
You did?
Mm-mm.

676
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:06,355
Did you like it?
Yes.

677
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:09,892
I'm impressed.
Thank you.

678
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:12,428
And how, how are you?

679
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:15,498
Been better.

680
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:23,939
And um, with the
um, ecstasy, is that?

681
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:26,408
Please don't start in.
No, I

682
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,179
I have never taken it.

683
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:33,115
But, you had, had it in
your purse. Why did you...

684
00:52:33,117 --> 00:52:38,287
I just thought I could
make some things better

685
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:40,890
With Jess, you and Jesse?

686
00:52:40,892 --> 00:52:42,224
I don't know, it's
supposed to help you

687
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:48,531
open up and help
you connect, and.

688
00:52:48,533 --> 00:52:52,801
But, not to be. Don't worry,
your sister isn't a drug addict.

689
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:54,637
Okay. You have to be careful.

690
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:56,205
I know.

691
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,712
How does Jenny seem?

692
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:05,814
Fine.

693
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:08,651
Really?
Mm-mm.

694
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:10,252
I don't think she's fine.

695
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:12,154
What do you mean?

696
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,692
I think you need to
let her go Paul.

697
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:22,831
I'm not, I'm not holding
her hostage or anything.

698
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:25,067
I just think she wants to
be doing other things.

699
00:53:25,069 --> 00:53:29,572
I think she wants, I think
she wants to go to school.

700
00:53:29,574 --> 00:53:32,074
In fact, I know she
wants to go to school.

701
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:35,511
She has never said anything
to me about school. I know..

702
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:36,845
Because she thinks
you don't want her to go.

703
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:39,248
She thinks you want her.
Never even...

704
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,250
Never even discussed...

705
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:42,351
Yeah, I know you
never discussed...

706
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:44,119
Where do you come up
with this? You're like

707
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:45,321
I come up with it from her.

708
00:53:45,323 --> 00:53:47,590
She filled out all her
college applications

709
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:48,657
and she won't send them in

710
00:53:48,659 --> 00:53:50,025
because she thinks you're
going to be crushed.

711
00:53:50,027 --> 00:53:56,298
Yeah. Okay. You're a piece
of work. You know that?

712
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,867
Yeah? How am I, how
am I a piece of work?

713
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:03,138
Um, okay. Well you
come into my house and...

714
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,673
I come into your house?
What do you mean?

715
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:06,208
It's our house. It's
our parents house.

716
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:09,745
Our house, our house,
but it's the house

717
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,081
The house that I've
been maintaining.

718
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,783
That I've been paying property
taxes on since mom died.

719
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,285
That's the house.
Okay fine that's your house,

720
00:54:16,287 --> 00:54:18,153
your house your house
That house that I've...

721
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:19,855
mm-mm.

722
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:22,958
And then, so you
come in and then you

723
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,961
and then you accuse me of
holding my daughter hostage.

724
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:30,132
Okay, as opposed to like,
letting her live here rent free.

725
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:33,235
Providing her with
gainful employment.

726
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:35,070
Teaching her,
teaching her a skill.

727
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:39,942
Yeah, in a field she
has zero interest in.

728
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:46,282
Just ask her.
Ask her if she's happy.

729
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:49,585
I don't know. I'm
going to put this away.

730
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:45,507
Hey in here?
Scaller?

731
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:48,243
Hello can you hear? I want
my money back please.

732
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:51,714
This guy is a God-damn fraud.

733
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:55,117
Fucking TMJ's back.
Hello are you here?

734
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,553

735
00:55:57,555 --> 00:56:01,590
Hello? Yeah, hey buddy.

736
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:03,058
Go ahead and do that there.
Ah, he's he's

737
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,461
Doctor He's in the
middle of a procedure.

738
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:07,062
This guy's a god-damn fraud.

739
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:11,900
Hello! Doctor. Oh there you are.
You did not cure my TMJ.

740
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:18,340
I, I never I never promised.

741
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:20,075
You didn't promise?
I paid you money.

742
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:21,543
I'd like my money back please.

743
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,046
Not only is my TMJ raging,

744
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,382
but I left here with the
worst headache of my life.

745
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:29,084
And I still have it. You
know it's getting worse.

746
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:31,120
Maybe if you could calm down
and stop yelling at everybody.

747
00:56:31,122 --> 00:56:34,323
Oh screw you!
Okay that's, that's that...

748
00:56:34,325 --> 00:56:37,726
You know do not get in
that chair. This guy's a...

00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:41,897
Oh my God!

750
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,870

Just stay lying on the floor.

768
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:10,078

And, I hope you have a
great rest of your day.

776
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,347

777
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,153

Wow.

781
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,703
Thought that was you.

01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,108
Can I sit down?

783
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,210

Yeah.

787
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:39,307
God, I.

788
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:43,712
I don't think I've
seen you since ah...

789
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:48,083
Gina's.

790
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:56,391
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

791
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,129
Yeah.

792
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,002
I don't drink like that
anymore, you know. I ah,

793
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:16,544
I've been sober for probably
about a year and a half. Um,

794
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:18,046
Good for you.

795
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:19,614
Thanks.

796
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,151
Anyway.

797
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,224
So you don't, you don't know?

798
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:33,461
You look good.

799
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:35,063
Thanks.

800
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:39,868
You guys still over
on Columbia St?

801
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:44,773
Ah, no. That's long back.
My, my grandma passed away.

802
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:47,275
Awe
Yeah.

803
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:50,178
I'm just back kind a
taking care of things.

804
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:52,180
Get the house ready to sell.

805
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:57,018
Yeah. I remember that house.

806
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:11,232
You want to see it?

807
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:25,146
Jenny?

808
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:34,155
Jenny.

809
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:00,482
Jenny?

810
01:07:00,484 --> 01:07:12,494
It's Dad. Ah, call me um, okay.
Bye.

811
01:08:54,096 --> 01:09:02,670
I remember. The light.

812
01:09:02,672 --> 01:09:06,007
The light in this room.

813
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:08,076
It felt like

814
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,949
morning but it wasn't.

815
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:22,991
I remember your bed
on the floor with...

816
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:25,226
just a box spring.

817
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:33,601
I remember UB-40
on the turntable.

818
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:40,775
"You Shoot Me Down With Flames."

819
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,815
I remember

820
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:59,494
you asking me if I trusted you.

821
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:06,868
I remember you opened your
button fly's with one "foop"

822
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:11,306
and I almost started
cracking up.

823
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:23,117
I remember, I
remember our bodies,

824
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:36,297
like one thing, like
one complete thing.

825
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:49,744
I remember feeling like
maybe I didn't have a body.

826
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:59,320
Did it hurt?

827
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:03,524
I don't know.

828
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:11,933
That part I don't remember.

829
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:24,612
Was I your first heartbreak?

830
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:25,847
Yeah.

831
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:42,997
I think I knew I was gonna
be even as I was doing it.

832
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:46,534
I'm sorry. I'm really
sorry for that.

833
01:11:53,676 --> 01:12:03,785
It's okay.

834
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:26,507
Hey.
Hi.

835
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:28,076
Uh, Abby's not here.

836
01:12:28,078 --> 01:12:30,578
I know, I know.

837
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,013
Um, you want to come in?

838
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:36,584
Do you, do you want to go
maybe see some music with me?

839
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:43,358
Um, right now?
Yeah.

840
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:51,199
Um, yeah. Yeah sure. Um,
let me just grab a jacket.

841
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:52,433
Okay.

How long were you
a messenger for?

873
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:37,318
Like five or six years.

874
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:43,824
Is that when you first got
into like, like all the biking?

875
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:50,031
Yeah. It was just so
much different then,

876
01:17:50,033 --> 01:17:52,233
just a different vibe.

877
01:17:52,235 --> 01:17:55,569
It was more my anarchist stage.

878
01:17:55,571 --> 01:17:56,771
Anarchist cycling?

879
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:59,173
Yeah.

880
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,676
I was just one angry dude.

881
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:06,347
That's hard to imagine.

882
01:18:06,349 --> 01:18:07,581
Is it?

883
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:17,892
Yeah. You're just,
you're so um...

884
01:18:17,894 --> 01:18:19,460
So what?

885
01:18:27,269 --> 01:18:30,905
Have you ever

886
01:18:30,907 --> 01:18:33,974
wanted to kiss
someone so badly

887
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:36,544
that it hurts your skin?

888
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:45,920
Ah, Jenny.

889
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:52,793
I don't know what to say.

890
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:57,364
You don't, you don't
have to say anything.

891
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:08,609
Maybe you, maybe you
could just kiss me.

892
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:15,349
It wouldn't, it wouldn't
have to mean anything.

893
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:21,856
Jenny, that's a terrible idea.

894
01:19:21,858 --> 01:19:31,198
I, I know. I know,
I Look I'm sorry.

895
01:19:34,102 --> 01:19:36,737
I mean, you know
I love Abby right?

896
01:19:36,739 --> 01:19:44,411
I, I know, I know, I know.

897
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:46,280
Are you okay?

898
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,551
Yeah.

899
01:19:50,553 --> 01:19:52,686
Are you sure?

900
01:19:56,057 --> 01:20:06,300
Maybe could you
just, just hold me?

901
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:11,138
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

902
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:48,329
Hey,
Hi.

903
