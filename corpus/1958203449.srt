1
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:13,073
Out of the dark ages,

2
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,465
a child was born.

3
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:21,559
Offspring of the
vampire Vladislas.

4
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:25,955
and immortal Circe

5
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:39,055
The oracle foretold that he
would one day slay his father.

6
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:46,845
The remedy was to dismember him

7
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:50,371
and scatter the pieces
upon the Black Sea.

8
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:06,561
A curse upon thee.

9
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:09,433
You cannot destroy me.

10
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:18,094
Crusaders stole the cursed child

11
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:22,359
and the demon-slaying dagger.

12
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:46,818
They delivered the child to
a fortress of the church.

13
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,911
The brothers cut
off its fingertips,

14
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:55,305
clipped its ears,

15
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:58,526
massaged its faced with potions

16
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:02,617
until monstrous features
could pass for human.

17
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,887
He was trained in
the arts of war,

18
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:16,065
sworn into a secret sect,

19
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:18,807
Knights of the Dragon,

20
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:22,463
Slayers of the Ancient Ones.

21
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:27,207
The creature grew to manhood,

22
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:30,558
hero of the great Crusades.

23
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,302
Decades he rode the continent,

24
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,869
slaying demons,

25
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,658
laying waste to pagan temples.

26
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:46,530
With no memory of his birthright

27
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:51,100
until the day his
destiny delivered him

28
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,450
to the castle of his father.

29
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:25,760
Prince Vladislas.

30
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:30,460
We have come for the bloodstone.

31
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:35,944
The bloodstone
was a gift to me.

32
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:38,599
We have come
for the bloodstone.

33
00:05:59,576 --> 00:06:02,362
What is your name, crusader?

34
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,365
Radu, the Fearless.

35
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:10,718
This is not our
day of reckoning.

36
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,422
It is here.

37
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,163
Let us slay these creatures

38
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:23,034
and let's be gone.

39
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:27,735
Stay your hand.

40
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,301
Listen to me.

41
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:32,479
Who is your father?

42
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:36,483
God is my father.

43
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,398
Your family name.

44
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,183
The church is my family.

45
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:43,707
You are stolen child.

46
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,753
The lost one.

47
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:49,104
Vladislas is your father.

48
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:52,760
All that is his can be yours.

49
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:56,067
- No.
- Don't listen to her.

50
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,025
She's a demon.

51
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:57,852
Silence.

52
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:01,638
Blood of my blood.

53
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,336
I'm your mother.

54
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:07,949
No.

55
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,082
You're an abomination.

56
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:14,042
Crusaders stole you from me

57
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,218
to fulfill the prophecy.

58
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:19,221
What prophecy?

59
00:07:20,614 --> 00:07:24,400
That one day you
will slay your father.

60
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:27,751
Is that true, Marius?

61
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:30,450
The patriarchs do
not share their secrets

62
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,929
with lowly monks, sir.

63
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:33,453
Heed my warning.

64
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,108
Kill him

65
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:40,938
and you will be
cursed into eternity.

66
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,507
In time you will understand.

67
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,206
Patience is a virtue,

68
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,819
to immortals such as we.

69
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:00,697
Brave.

70
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,483
Don't listen to
the lies of demons.

71
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,488
She spoke the truth, Marius.

72
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,447
The patriarchs should
counsel you on questions

73
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:13,536
of your lineage.

74
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,756
For now we have the bloodstone.

75
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:18,410
Our brothers did
not die in vain.

76
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,282
Make with the holy water.

77
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:27,811
In the name of Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit,

78
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:29,334
I purge this house of evil.

79
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,729
Radu, wait for me.

80
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:40,998
Hey Radu, don't leave me here.

81
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,744
There's life in this castle.

82
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,877
Vladislas and his consort.

83
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:54,403
No, they're far away by now.

84
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,262
Sir, I beg you.

85
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:12,786
Spare my child.

86
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:14,614
Please.

87
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,748
Please, please, sir,
I bet you, I beg you.

88
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:20,620
All must die, Radu.

89
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,057
Do your duty and
purge this house.

90
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:26,016
These are innocents.

91
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:27,888
It's our duty to rescue them.

92
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,151
Come closer.

93
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:34,764
I won't hurt you.

94
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:39,029
No!

95
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,735
No.

96
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:57,482
Take my child from this
cursed place, please.

97
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:59,441
No mother, I'll stay with you.

98
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:02,009
Kill these wretched
creatures, Radu.

99
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:03,488
Silence, Marius.

100
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:05,882
What's your name?

101
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:12,149
Helena.

102
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,892
Vladislas stole me
from my father's house.

103
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:20,244
He ravaged me for pleasure,

104
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:23,247
but I swear he did
not drink my blood.

105
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:27,730
Stephan is the child
of our shameful union.

106
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:33,040
Vladislas waits Stephan
to grow to manhood,

107
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,346
to taint him with the
blood of Nosferatu.

108
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:37,479
Please.

109
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:42,397
I'll deliver you from
this ungodly place.

110
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:43,441
My savior.

111
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,356
Are you mad, Radu?

112
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:46,836
She's the vampires consort.

113
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:48,708
She's the spawn.

114
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,274
Step aside, I'll kill
them myself if I have to.

115
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,065
There's been enough
slaughter here.

116
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,683
Come here, brother.

117
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,555
Come to me.

118
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:15,125
Come here.

119
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,039
Let me see.

120
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:30,619
We are duty-bound
to kill them. Radu.

121
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,187
The child is innocent.

122
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:36,494
We do not choose our father.

123
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:42,457
Follow me.

124
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,895
Where are you taking us?

125
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:48,028
To A wonderful city.

126
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:49,638
The city of God and light.

127
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:06,568
God forsakes us, Radu.

128
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:07,917
They've taken the horses.

129
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:10,790
We must be gone
from this place.

130
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,118
Rest here, little brother.

131
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,433
You rest easy.

132
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:46,608
I'll watch over you.

133
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,658
We'll shelter here
for the night.

134
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:57,140
It's not safe for
traveling, in the sunlight.

135
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,751
Our lives are in your hands.

136
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:09,457
I'm a servant of God.

137
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,766
You're my Lord and savior.

138
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,250
Here's a place you can rest.

139
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,011
Thank you.

140
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,039
Ah, my eyes.

141
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:13,913
My eyes, my eyes.

142
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:18,047
Hey. Hey.

143
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,096
You lived your whole
life in darkness.

144
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:26,099
It'll take time for your
body to adjust to the sun.

145
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:30,364
Don't worry, there's
nothing to fear.

146
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:33,976
The sun is the most powerful
being in the heavens,

147
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:35,935
the source of all life.

148
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,632
God is the most powerful being

149
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:41,331
in all creation and
the source of all life.

150
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:43,420
Don't bore the boy with dogma.

151
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,032
Kneel by the rocks and
pray for salvation, boy.

152
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:48,382
Do as he says.

153
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,995
This is madness, Radu.

154
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,041
I understand you're
pity for the boy

155
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,304
but you have to
destroy the mother.

156
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:58,958
You saw when I examined her.

157
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,438
She's unbitten.

158
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,792
I will not take part in this.

159
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,359
Release me for my service.

160
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:12,145
What, I can't do that.

161
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:13,668
You're my conscience.

162
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:15,191
You're my only friend.

163
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:17,889
I had my fill of the
church's dark work,

164
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:20,805
but you my friend are
flirting with disaster.

165
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:22,982
You know I will do
whatever is necessary.

166
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:23,852
You know that.

167
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:28,857
I'm sorry Radu,

168
00:16:30,554 --> 00:16:31,555
but I must go.

169
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:37,692
So be it.

170
00:16:39,911 --> 00:16:41,000
Go with good fortune.

171
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:45,917
Marius?

172
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,445
I hope our paths
will cross again.

173
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,315
Me too, brother.

174
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,709
But I fear they will not.

175
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,364
May God protect you.

176
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,375
Where is brother Marius going?

177
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,550
To see his fortune.

178
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:12,944
Why does he talk
of killing my mother?

179
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:17,253
He believes her blood
is tainted by Vladislas.

180
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,268
Helena, it's time to go.
No, I cannot.

181
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:36,751
Go without me.

182
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:37,578
Sure you can.

183
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,461
She awoke
with the sunset.

184
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,552
She too had lived in darkness

185
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:57,772
and would need time to
adjust to the light.

186
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:03,734
I wanted to believe
in her humanity.

187
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,608
But I could not shake my fear

188
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:11,046
that God had forsaken us.

189
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,775
You are my
guardian angel, Radu.

190
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,217
You fear me.

191
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,177
I am human.

192
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:57,397
I swear to you.

193
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:00,008
How can I prove myself?

194
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:08,946
You are spawn of Vladislas.

195
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:11,688
Have mercy on me.

196
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,215
No, that's my mother.

197
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,390
I'll kill you.

198
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,305
Lay down your sword, brother,

199
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:20,741
and I'll lay down mine.

200
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,484
Go back to sleep.

201
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:26,964
It's okay.

202
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:45,940
By some miracle,
I am still human.

203
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,247
In time, your
humanity will fade.

204
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,643
To save the blood of the saints

205
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,471
brings peace to
the fallen souls.

206
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:57,560
Drink.

207
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,564
If it relieves your suffering.

208
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:48,437
There was no turning back,

209
00:21:50,918 --> 00:21:53,964
no miracle to save us.

210
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:00,841
She slept in the shadows,

211
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:05,846
leaving me to grow
closer to the Stephan.

212
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:20,904
Is she gonna die?

213
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:32,307
Some would say
she is already dead.

214
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:39,227
She's a vampire
like my father.

215
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:40,576
She is becoming one.

216
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:43,971
Will you slay her?

217
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,235
Not today.

218
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:52,196
Someday perhaps.

219
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:56,157
With your sword,

220
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:58,681
you can make it
quick and painless.

221
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:03,817
Death is never painless.

222
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:09,910
Someone must slay her.

223
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:12,782
I'll pray it will be.

224
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:19,398
We traveled by night.

225
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,836
Pilgrims on an unholy quest.

226
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:24,446
I let her suckle freely

227
00:23:24,446 --> 00:23:26,013
from the bloodstone.

228
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:31,018
For that there would
surely come a reckoning.

229
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:17,586
How does it feel to drink
the blood of the saints?

230
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:22,461
It feels like miracles.

231
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:25,289
The knowledge

232
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:29,555
and power

233
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:33,472
and mercy.

234
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:37,519
You are curious?

235
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:41,697
I was taught to
resist temptation.

236
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:46,223
The bloodstone
was your father's.

237
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:48,965
It is your birthright.

238
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:51,925
Drink, Radu.

239
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:56,625
No one will know,

240
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,454
but you and I.

241
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:01,978
Drink.

242
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:04,459
Drink.

243
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,047
You must never leave me, Radu.

244
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:32,226
You are my guardian,
my love, my savior

245
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,187
until eternity.

246
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:55,510
Forgive me, Radu.

247
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:13,746
You have desecrated my castle,

248
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:18,011
my consort, and my child.

249
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,103
The bloodstone,
Helena, and the boy

250
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,063
belong to me.

251
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:29,718
No. Leave my mother alone.

252
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:30,589
Take me.

253
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,415
Leave Stephan.

254
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:32,242
Silence.

255
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,506
I claim the monster slayer.

256
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,118
Seize it, Stephan,

257
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:41,077
before he wields it
against your mother.

258
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,432
Farewell, my son.

259
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,653
With no master to guide you,

260
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:55,309
you will soon be dust.

261
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:40,702
Marius?

262
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:43,052
Who's there?

263
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:47,666
Who's there?

264
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:51,757
Radu?

265
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:02,506
Heaven's brother.

266
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:03,420
What's happened?

267
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,119
I'm defiled.

268
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:12,255
May God have
mercy on your soul.

269
00:28:18,174 --> 00:28:19,698
Stake me to the ground.

270
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:23,614
Let the sun destroy me.

271
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:27,793
I cannot.

272
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:31,448
I beg.

273
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:36,715
Or I will be a plague
upon the Earth.

274
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,305
Forgive me, Marius.

275
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,568
I was a fool.

276
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:06,222
No, Radu.

277
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:07,571
I should not have left you.

278
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:32,945
Cursed one, you
treacherous monk.

279
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:37,384
Show him Mercy.

280
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,779
Mercy is for the weak.

281
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:49,135
Fear not, my child.

282
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:54,314
Vladislas has fled
upon the north wind.

283
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:56,142
She cursed me

284
00:29:56,142 --> 00:29:58,666
with the blood of Nosferatu.

285
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:01,103
Your father cursed you

286
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:03,366
at the moment of our union.

287
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:06,239
Church made you pretty,

288
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,722
but in time your face will
betray your bloodline.

289
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,637
Let me die

290
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:17,641
before I thirst for blood.

291
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:19,905
You are as I am.

292
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:20,775
Immortal.

293
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:24,692
Nothing can destroy you.

294
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:26,563
Come with me.

295
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:30,567
Together we'll lay wast
to Vladislas and his clan

296
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,658
and keep the bloodstone
as your prize.

297
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:48,934
So began my
century-long apprenticeship

298
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:52,285
in the black arts.

299
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,856
I learned to draw power
from the earth and sky.

300
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,906
Incantation to summon demons.

301
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:22,837
The skills of the hunt.

302
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:32,064
Stealth

303
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:39,288
and speed.

304
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:49,951
And all the while, visions of
Helena tormented my dreams.

305
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:14,323
After all I've done for you,

306
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:16,238
you dare steal from me?

307
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,554
Curse you, rite of Vladislas.

308
00:32:27,554 --> 00:32:29,904
I forbid you to return.

309
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:35,040
I ventured
out into the darkness

310
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,479
to seek Helena and the
solace of the bloodstone.

311
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:43,657
I slept far from
the light of day

312
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:46,573
in crypts of the dead,

313
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:56,887
Tormented by dreams of
my brother and my master,

314
00:32:58,367 --> 00:32:59,194
Helena.

315
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:06,071
I ached for kindred spirits
to share the endless night,

316
00:33:07,463 --> 00:33:11,032
for some spell binding
thing of beauty

317
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:14,949
that could soothe the
slow crawl of time.

318
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,001
I found it in the
music of Ash and Ariel.

319
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,918
Thank you, kind friends.

320
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:56,833
It has been an honor
for us to perform to you

321
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,357
our songs tonight.

322
00:34:58,357 --> 00:35:00,098
We are the humble troubadours,

323
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,796
Jonathan Ash and my
beautiful sister, Ariel.

324
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:17,376
It's not even enough
for a room at the inn.

325
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:24,687
The villagers here
are more used to music

326
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:27,473
that makes them
get up and dance.

327
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:30,476
My brother and I
are serious composers,

328
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:32,130
not dancing monkeys.

329
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:52,498
You're welcome to
sleep here tonight.

330
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:53,673
Thank you sir.

331
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:54,978
But don't touch my wine

332
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:57,633
or my daughter.

333
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:58,547
You have my word.

334
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:06,164
What troubles you, sister?

335
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,948
Did you see that strange man

336
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:10,907
lurking at the
back of the crowd?

337
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:14,084
I saw a bakers dozen
of strange people today.

338
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:15,869
These villages can
be quite amusing.

339
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:18,350
I'm serious, Jonathan.

340
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:21,614
This man, he had
an aura of death.

341
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:01,262
Who are you?

342
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:03,264
Come to me?

343
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:05,832
What do you want?

344
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:10,053
Let me cross your threshold.

345
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:12,795
No, please leave us alone.

346
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:16,364
Come to me and I'll
initiate you to the mysteries.

347
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:21,456
Father, lord in
heaven, protect us
from this evil spirit.

348
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:26,896
Jonathan, Jonathan, wake up.

349
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:28,507
What? What's wrong?

350
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:29,334
The demon.

351
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:30,813
He's come back.

352
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:31,640
What demon?

353
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,554
Don't be silly.

354
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:45,001
Hello?

355
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:45,828
Someone there?

356
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,570
Show yourself.

357
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,050
I must warn you, I am armed.

358
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:57,144
It's the angel of death.

359
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:59,842
Fear not, pretty ones.

360
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:01,366
We are guests of King Carol,

361
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:03,411
on route to perform
for the royal wedding.

362
00:38:03,411 --> 00:38:05,674
I am Radu Vladislas,

363
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:07,197
knight of the church,

364
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:10,549
to escort you safely
to your destination.

365
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:14,988
You're a knight of the church.

366
00:38:14,988 --> 00:38:16,990
You spoke to me
of the mysteries.

367
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,948
Let us see your face.

368
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,693
What's wrong with you?

369
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:26,521
I'm shamed by my bloodline.

370
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:31,831
Spirit, please
sir, I beg of you.

371
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:34,355
The king will send his
men to search for us.

372
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:37,402
Your royal patronage
is a pittance

373
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:39,447
compared with what I offer.

374
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,495
And what is it
you're offering?

375
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:45,758
Eternal life.

376
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:48,326
Undying devotion in return

377
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:54,332
for your companionship and
the solace of your music.

378
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:56,551
No. Jonathan, please.

379
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:58,031
Our father who are in heaven.

380
00:38:58,031 --> 00:38:59,032
- Quiet, sister.
- Protect us

381
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:00,338
from this evil spirit.

382
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,601
Let us hear him out.

383
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:05,386
You sir, you are patron.

384
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:06,300
Guardian.

385
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:08,215
Protector.

386
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:12,480
Embrace me and your
music will resonate

387
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,701
with the myteries and
you will live forever.

388
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,095
You would teach
us the mysteries.

389
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:21,837
I will initiate Ariel.

390
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:25,493
No.

391
00:39:25,493 --> 00:39:26,364
As her mentor?

392
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:28,453
Her master.

393
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:32,108
Our music will live
without your help.

394
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:33,675
God is my shepherd.

395
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,416
I seek no master.

396
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:37,070
Come to me willingly

397
00:39:38,506 --> 00:39:42,075
and I will have you
both as my disciples.

398
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:43,381
I'm a willing student.

399
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:46,035
Make my music immortal.

400
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,390
No!

401
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:58,744
Vampire, burn in hell.

402
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:06,708
Bow to me, Ariel

403
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,017
and I resurrect your brother.

404
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:13,019
No.

405
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:15,456
Jonathan.

406
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:17,284
Jonathan, wake up.

407
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:33,605
Life or death.

408
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,217
The choice is yours.

409
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:40,176
Life.

410
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:42,004
Life.

411
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:45,399
Accept me Ariel,

412
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:50,360
and I'll resurrect
the both of you,

413
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,450
and you two will never fade.

414
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,670
Please Ariel.

415
00:40:57,498 --> 00:40:59,152
For the love of God.

416
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,154
Choose life.

417
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,332
Life.

418
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:30,705
You are my children now.

419
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,949
The night has fallen.

420
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:59,212
What have you done to us?

421
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:01,693
I blessed you with eternal life.

422
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:03,303
What is this place?

423
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:08,743
This is a catacomb
of my father's castle.

424
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:12,138
No, no.

425
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:13,226
Help, please!

426
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:16,534
There's no one to hear you.

427
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,058
No hope of escape.

428
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,105
We together now.

429
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,063
Do not touch me.

430
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,240
You've destroyed us.

431
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:30,460
We demand to be set free.

432
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,594
Oh you will be free
when you are ready.

433
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:34,987
And when will that be?

434
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:40,340
When all traces of
your existence has faded

435
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,297
from memory,

436
00:42:43,212 --> 00:42:48,217
you will live again.

437
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:49,697
Avatars of music.

438
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:53,788
You will burn for this.

439
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:56,530
Kneel to me and
I'll be generous.

440
00:42:57,966 --> 00:42:59,968
Keep your vile
hands off my flute

441
00:42:59,968 --> 00:43:02,492
or I swear to God
I will kill you.

442
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:13,112
It is forbidden
to harm your master.

443
00:43:15,854 --> 00:43:17,595
You are not our master.

444
00:43:18,508 --> 00:43:19,335
You are a fiend.

445
00:43:20,772 --> 00:43:22,817
I'm your only
hope of survival.

446
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:28,040
Soon a craving will
overwhelm your senses.

447
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:33,001
A thirst that only
blood can satisfy.

448
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,745
You have so much to learn.

449
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,366
I left them to suffer
the first pangs

450
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:54,588
of blood thirst and
solitude and uncertainty.

451
00:44:00,246 --> 00:44:02,988
Our father who art in heaven,

452
00:44:02,988 --> 00:44:05,207
hallowed be thy name.

453
00:44:06,252 --> 00:44:07,949
Feed fledglings.

454
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:11,692
Before your thirst
drives you mad.

455
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:12,867
Stay away from us.

456
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,915
One sip of blood can
sustain you for days.

457
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:19,526
You can live on her for months.

458
00:44:19,526 --> 00:44:20,919
I would die first.

459
00:44:20,919 --> 00:44:23,051
Oh you died already.

460
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:24,009
You've been reborn.

461
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,622
This is your
gateway to eternity.

462
00:44:28,622 --> 00:44:31,277
You cannot deny your craving.

463
00:44:34,106 --> 00:44:34,541
No!

464
00:44:57,216 --> 00:44:58,826
Drink.

465
00:44:58,826 --> 00:44:59,827
No.

466
00:44:59,827 --> 00:45:01,350
Oh, blood is life.

467
00:45:02,482 --> 00:45:04,310
Jonathan, no.

468
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:07,008
It's noble of you to
cling to your human heart.

469
00:45:08,488 --> 00:45:10,925
I too was human
once upon a time.

470
00:45:12,187 --> 00:45:14,407
Surrender to your cravings.

471
00:45:16,148 --> 00:45:17,323
No!

472
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:19,412
There's no shame in it.

473
00:45:31,772 --> 00:45:33,731
Drink fledgling,

474
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,516
her blood will
ease your despair.

475
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:41,869
Drink.

476
00:45:50,269 --> 00:45:51,618
Drink.

477
00:45:51,618 --> 00:45:53,359
Do not kill.

478
00:45:59,278 --> 00:46:00,540
Gentle, gentle.

479
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:03,891
Drink.

480
00:46:07,112 --> 00:46:07,939
Oh.

481
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,864
You magnificent creature.

482
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,606
The sadness will pass.

483
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:40,362
Years passed.

484
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,105
I had fledglings to
ease my solitude.

485
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,542
Ariel to worship.

486
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:49,545
But visions Helena

487
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,420
never ceased to
thrill and haunt me.

488
00:47:18,357 --> 00:47:21,839
The endless bloodlust
had driven Ariel mad

489
00:47:26,321 --> 00:47:28,671
and left Ash an empty shell.

490
00:47:39,595 --> 00:47:40,770
Ash, my child.

491
00:47:42,903 --> 00:47:45,427
What is your desire?

492
00:47:45,427 --> 00:47:46,254
Music.

493
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,997
My soul is starved for harmony.

494
00:47:51,694 --> 00:47:53,218
I have longed for this moment.

495
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:19,679
Ariel, come,

496
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:20,941
fill the night with songs.

497
00:48:23,422 --> 00:48:25,859
Your wretched fingers
have defiled it.

498
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:27,556
Ariel, please.

499
00:48:27,556 --> 00:48:28,906
It could bring us peace.

500
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,211
Play fledgling.

501
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:32,474
Comfort me.

502
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:56,716
Do not defy me.

503
00:48:57,804 --> 00:48:59,197
My soul is barren.

504
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:05,290
Without joy there is no music.

505
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:07,814
Yes.

506
00:49:08,815 --> 00:49:10,077
Give us solace.

507
00:49:11,035 --> 00:49:13,385
Joy's not the only muse.

508
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:17,606
There is comfort too
in songs of heartbreak.

509
00:49:23,743 --> 00:49:25,310
My muse has fled.

510
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:35,973
In time Ariel
accepted me as a master.

511
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,891
I honored my vow
and initiated them

512
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:44,807
to the mysteries

513
00:49:47,723 --> 00:49:51,423
and shared with them the
raptures of the kill.

514
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:56,384
Let's just run away together.

515
00:49:56,384 --> 00:49:57,559
Really?

516
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:58,734
You really think we should?

517
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:00,171
I do.

518
00:50:00,171 --> 00:50:01,302
I think we just should
get out of here.

519
00:50:01,302 --> 00:50:02,216
And what?

520
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,110
And while
I indulged them,

521
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,722
feeling kinship
for the first time

522
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:15,681
since my love for Marius,

523
00:51:17,204 --> 00:51:19,424
and my distraction,

524
00:51:19,424 --> 00:51:21,034
while Leia defiled.

525
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:57,826
Help me please.

526
00:52:57,826 --> 00:52:59,959
My father will reward you.

527
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:02,266
By the power of the church,

528
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:04,311
I purge this evil place.

529
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:10,317
May God, have
mercy on your soul.

530
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:24,679
Radu, what is this?

531
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:27,116
Night of the dragon.

532
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:30,642
I'm Diana,
appointed to slay you.

533
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,560
You high spirit.

534
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:38,911
What's your bloodline?

535
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:41,696
I'm descended from
the sorceress Calisto.

536
00:53:43,176 --> 00:53:46,135
You are a stolen
child like I was

537
00:53:46,135 --> 00:53:48,355
forced to serve the
church their calling.

538
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:52,794
To rid the world
of monsters like you.

539
00:53:52,794 --> 00:53:54,927
This demon slayer
was taken from Circe

540
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:56,972
on the night of your birth.

541
00:53:56,972 --> 00:53:59,497
It will end your
torment once and for all

542
00:53:59,497 --> 00:54:02,674
Hand it to me and
I'll show you mercy.

543
00:54:02,674 --> 00:54:04,241
Curse you.

544
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,244
You are no match for me.

545
00:54:23,651 --> 00:54:25,174
Drink, fledglings.

546
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,613
Save the blood of a living god.

547
00:55:09,436 --> 00:55:10,872
Give me the relic

548
00:55:11,917 --> 00:55:13,484
or you'll suffer.

549
00:55:13,484 --> 00:55:15,181
We have suffered long enough.

550
00:55:21,709 --> 00:55:23,668
We have mastered
the mysteries.

551
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:26,148
We'll seek our fortune
in the great night.

552
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:43,514
I'm your master,

553
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:47,822
but I spurn you as my fledgling.

554
00:55:49,737 --> 00:55:52,740
Without my guidance,
you will perish

555
00:55:54,786 --> 00:55:55,613
in agony.

556
00:56:12,586 --> 00:56:15,284
300 years they roamed the earth,

557
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:20,942
haunting the world
of arts and music.

558
00:56:30,778 --> 00:56:33,302
300 years I searched for them.

559
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,916
I lament the day I found them.

560
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,097
In time, my appearance
betrayed my bloodline.

561
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:06,597
Hello.

562
00:57:25,746 --> 00:57:26,921
fledglings.

563
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:30,838
Kneel before your master.

564
00:57:31,926 --> 00:57:34,102
You are not the master here.

565
00:57:34,102 --> 00:57:36,496
This city is ruled by our queen.

566
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:40,021
Return my mother's
demon slayer.

567
00:57:40,021 --> 00:57:42,459
It was taken from
us centuries ago.

568
00:57:43,547 --> 00:57:45,374
The vampire queen seized it

569
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:47,420
in exchange for sanctuary.

570
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,856
I know where it is.

571
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:49,944
We can lead you there.

572
00:57:51,424 --> 00:57:53,426
It's in the city
beneath the city.

573
00:57:53,426 --> 00:57:55,123
Take me to your queen.

574
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,053
This is one of the seven
entrances to the city

575
00:58:12,053 --> 00:58:12,967
beneath the city.

576
00:58:36,774 --> 00:58:38,340
Be ware what you say here.

577
00:58:40,081 --> 00:58:43,389
The sound travels to the ancient
corners where demons dwell.

578
00:58:45,086 --> 00:58:47,175
I hear music.

579
00:58:47,175 --> 00:58:51,832
There is a brothel and
casino on the street above us.

580
00:58:51,832 --> 00:58:55,575
Our principle source of
income and willing partners.

581
00:59:19,338 --> 00:59:20,165
My queen.

582
00:59:21,296 --> 00:59:22,776
May we enter

583
00:59:22,776 --> 00:59:25,300
You ventured out again
without my blessing.

584
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,867
I'm sorry your majesty.

585
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:28,303
I hunger for the hunt.

586
00:59:28,303 --> 00:59:29,783
No, it was my fault.

587
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:32,133
I crave for music.

588
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:33,831
Who is this stranger?

589
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:35,397
Our first master, my queen.

590
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:38,749
Bring him before me.

591
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:52,763
Helena.

592
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:56,288
You know my name.

593
00:59:57,898 --> 00:59:59,726
Don't you remember me?

594
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:02,555
Radu Vladislas,

595
01:00:05,036 --> 01:00:06,037
brother to Stephan.

596
01:00:08,082 --> 01:00:09,823
Radu, the Fearless.

597
01:00:11,129 --> 01:00:12,086
My savior.

598
01:00:13,871 --> 01:00:15,742
You have aged.

599
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:19,920
It is five centuries
since you defiled me.

600
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,315
Releasee my fledglings

601
01:00:23,315 --> 01:00:25,099
and return the holy relic

602
01:00:26,753 --> 01:00:29,713
they stole from my Leia.

603
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:32,541
I will speak with
your master in private.

604
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:35,893
Amuse yourselves in my
library, but do not kill her.

605
01:00:56,174 --> 01:00:58,263
What became of Stephan?

606
01:00:59,873 --> 01:01:01,875
Vladislas let him
grow to manhood,

607
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:04,617
then stole him from the sun.

608
01:01:06,184 --> 01:01:07,794
He roams the new world now,

609
01:01:09,578 --> 01:01:11,319
a man of wealth and science.

610
01:01:12,451 --> 01:01:13,670
And Vladislas?

611
01:01:15,062 --> 01:01:17,325
The eternal darkness
drove him mad.

612
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:19,980
He begged me to
end his suffering.

613
01:01:21,547 --> 01:01:24,681
He lies entombed in
the catacombs below,

614
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,119
the sword of Laertes
impaled through his heart.

615
01:01:31,078 --> 01:01:32,689
And the bloodstone?

616
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,779
As you intended.

617
01:01:36,867 --> 01:01:38,390
It has been my salvation.

618
01:01:46,659 --> 01:01:50,837
I will share it with you if
you pledge your devotion.

619
01:01:50,837 --> 01:01:54,493
I'm yours from
the day I saw you.

620
01:01:58,236 --> 01:02:03,241
There is ecstasy
enough from both of us.

621
01:02:29,441 --> 01:02:30,572
Drink Ariel.

622
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:33,271
Her blood is sweet.

623
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,362
I'm sickened by this
languid way of feeding.

624
01:02:39,494 --> 01:02:41,758
I seek for blood
that reeks fear.

625
01:02:58,165 --> 01:03:00,559
For five centuries
you haunted me.

626
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:06,043
The perfume of your skin,

627
01:03:07,566 --> 01:03:10,221
the purity of your
love for Stephan.

628
01:03:12,049 --> 01:03:14,138
I cannot dwell upon the past.

629
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,185
Memories fill me with despair.

630
01:03:19,578 --> 01:03:22,102
At least we're together.

631
01:03:22,102 --> 01:03:23,756
You were my savior once.

632
01:03:25,932 --> 01:03:28,979
All that is mine,
Radu, can be yours.

633
01:03:30,371 --> 01:03:31,198
My land.

634
01:03:33,026 --> 01:03:34,114
The bloodstone.

635
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:41,252
If you bestow upon me
one act of devotion.

636
01:03:45,734 --> 01:03:46,910
Your fledgling Ash.

637
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:52,872
Ash is not worthy of you.

638
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:54,831
You are a monster, Radu.

639
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,224
Ash is a pretty one.

640
01:03:58,704 --> 01:04:00,358
I could toy with
him for centuries.

641
01:04:00,358 --> 01:04:02,839
I was born of ancient blood.

642
01:04:05,363 --> 01:04:06,843
I wanna be your consort.

643
01:04:09,715 --> 01:04:10,977
Like old friends,

644
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:14,024
let's talk of our futures.

645
01:04:36,176 --> 01:04:37,612
Come fledglings.

646
01:04:41,442 --> 01:04:43,618
Your master and I
have struck a bargain.

647
01:05:15,868 --> 01:05:17,914
As proof of his devotion,

648
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,916
Radu has given you to me.

649
01:05:20,829 --> 01:05:22,135
From this day forth,

650
01:05:22,135 --> 01:05:23,615
I will be your master.

651
01:05:24,703 --> 01:05:26,444
Hold me above Radu

652
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,927
and all that I possess
is yours to share.

653
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:34,669
But we have lived apart
from him for centuries.

654
01:05:34,669 --> 01:05:36,889
We are not his
property to trade

655
01:05:36,889 --> 01:05:38,499
Silence her, Radu.

656
01:05:40,762 --> 01:05:43,809
Radu told me that you
were troubadours once

657
01:05:45,245 --> 01:05:47,117
and that your music
moved him deeply.

658
01:05:48,205 --> 01:05:49,858
That was another lifetime.

659
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:51,991
Our muse abandoned
us so long ago.

660
01:05:53,427 --> 01:05:55,473
Vladislas defiled
our instruments.

661
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:56,778
Bite your tongue, girl.

662
01:05:56,778 --> 01:05:58,824
Your Radu's plaything.

663
01:05:58,824 --> 01:06:00,434
You mean nothing to me.

664
01:06:00,434 --> 01:06:01,914
Nor you to me.

665
01:06:01,914 --> 01:06:03,960
Radu is my Lord and master,

666
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,223
may he reign bloody
hell upon you.

667
01:06:06,223 --> 01:06:08,703
Discipline her Radu
or I will banish her.

668
01:06:08,703 --> 01:06:11,184
Don't you threaten me.

669
01:06:12,316 --> 01:06:14,753
I'll bend her to the path.

670
01:06:14,753 --> 01:06:18,452
Break her or I
will banish you both.

671
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:20,411
Go to your chamber.

672
01:06:26,373 --> 01:06:28,462
Come, I have a gift for you.

673
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:39,604
Master, my
chamber is this way.

674
01:06:39,604 --> 01:06:42,389
The lower levels are forbidden.

675
01:06:42,389 --> 01:06:44,348
What I seek is forbidden.

676
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:57,013
Master, please deliver us
from this wretched place.

677
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,536
I will serve you till the end.

678
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:01,626
Patience, pretty one.

679
01:07:03,497 --> 01:07:08,502
Patience.

680
01:07:47,498 --> 01:07:49,239
You resurrected me.

681
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:52,633
What is your name,

682
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,897
that I may reward you.

683
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,118
I am your first born.

684
01:08:00,859 --> 01:08:02,078
Radu Vladislas.

685
01:08:03,818 --> 01:08:05,994
Now to fulfill my destiny.

686
01:08:43,945 --> 01:08:45,077
My gift to you.

687
01:08:46,687 --> 01:08:47,949
Find your joy again.

688
01:08:49,386 --> 01:08:51,605
We have all the
time in the world.

689
01:08:51,605 --> 01:08:53,172
Strike us a wondrous chord.

690
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,232
I am barren.

691
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:14,150
From this day forth,
the blood of the saints

692
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,238
shall be your muse.

693
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:19,677
Drink.

694
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:20,504
Drink.

695
01:09:22,941 --> 01:09:23,768
Drink.

696
01:09:40,263 --> 01:09:41,133
My muse.

697
01:09:42,874 --> 01:09:44,180
She's whispering to me.

698
01:09:45,311 --> 01:09:47,487
Open your heart.

699
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:49,663
Give voice to the epiphanies.

700
01:10:04,852 --> 01:10:06,506
You crossed my
threshold uninvited.

701
01:10:06,506 --> 01:10:11,511
I showed you mercy
and you stole my life.

702
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:16,037
And yet I'll serve
until the end of time.

703
01:10:16,037 --> 01:10:19,476
Will you not feel emotion

704
01:10:20,564 --> 01:10:23,306
when you look into my eyes?

705
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:27,614
When I look into your
eyes, I feel revulsion.

706
01:10:28,746 --> 01:10:31,052
You are an abomination, Radu.

707
01:10:31,052 --> 01:10:33,446
You reek of the grave.

708
01:10:33,446 --> 01:10:36,014
Your touch is repulsive.

709
01:10:36,014 --> 01:10:38,582
Your voice is as loathsome

710
01:10:38,582 --> 01:10:40,932
as the the breath
that conveys it.

711
01:10:40,932 --> 01:10:43,891
And your proud blood makes me-

712
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:46,981
No, no, no, no!

713
01:10:49,897 --> 01:10:52,248
All that I owe to you.

714
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,771
No, Radu.

715
01:10:53,771 --> 01:10:55,642
It is forbid to
kill your master.

716
01:10:55,642 --> 01:10:57,078
I have no master.

717
01:11:05,478 --> 01:11:07,001
Master, stop.

718
01:11:07,001 --> 01:11:08,089
You're destroying her.

719
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,963
Sister, I have the
bloodstone, we must leave now.

720
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:13,051
It's all we need.

721
01:11:23,148 --> 01:11:24,628
Curse you, Radu.

722
01:11:26,456 --> 01:11:30,764
I will be reborn and haunt
you till the end of time.

723
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,642
Master, she has your blade.

724
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:54,266
Master, my brother,

725
01:11:54,266 --> 01:11:56,312
he stole your bloodstone.

726
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:35,394
Are you dying, Master?

727
01:12:37,265 --> 01:12:39,267
I'm cursed to live forever.

728
01:12:41,139 --> 01:12:43,141
Let me drink from your wound.

729
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:44,621
It's a shame for it to waste.

730
01:12:59,157 --> 01:12:59,984
Ariel.

731
01:13:02,203 --> 01:13:04,858
If you choose to abandon me,

732
01:13:06,556 --> 01:13:08,079
I will not stalk.

733
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:12,344
This night has set you free.

734
01:13:12,344 --> 01:13:14,868
If I'm truly free, Radu,

735
01:13:14,868 --> 01:13:16,740
I was done to be your fledgling.

736
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:20,657
I will be your concert.

737
01:13:23,747 --> 01:13:25,923
I pledge myself to thee.

738
01:13:28,969 --> 01:13:30,406
Radu Vladislas.

739
01:13:33,452 --> 01:13:35,585
I have searched
the world for you.

740
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:39,676
At last, we are united.

741
01:13:39,676 --> 01:13:42,722
You are blood of my blood.

742
01:13:42,722 --> 01:13:44,332
You cannot harm me.

743
01:13:53,472 --> 01:13:55,648
I can harm you grievously.

744
01:14:09,706 --> 01:14:11,708
She was my redemption.

745
01:14:11,708 --> 01:14:14,624
How dare you seek
make believe legacies.

746
01:14:16,103 --> 01:14:18,584
To watch you suffer
is a rare delight.

747
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:21,631
A delight that will
surely ripen with time.

748
01:14:23,284 --> 01:14:24,808
I'll leave you to your suffering

749
01:14:24,808 --> 01:14:26,287
and send you to
hell another day.

750
01:14:28,855 --> 01:14:33,643
I'm here to purge this nest of
evil, be gone when I return.

751
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:53,140
I left Ariel
to the merciless sun,

752
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:56,492
vowing never to return
to this dark place.

753
01:15:02,106 --> 01:15:05,022
But in time, the
shadow of Helena,

754
01:15:06,806 --> 01:15:08,634
my master and creator,

755
01:15:11,028 --> 01:15:12,943
will fulfill her curse,

756
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,642
and torment me to madness.
