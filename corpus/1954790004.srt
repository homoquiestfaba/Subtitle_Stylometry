1
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,107
Look.

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,510
I know this is
a weird situation,

3
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,145
but...

4
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:14,680
all I can say is that

5
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:15,748
when I'm here with you,

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,518
I'm completely here.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,722
Yes, you pay me
for my time,

8
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:28,027
but, um...

9
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:31,163
you can't...

10
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,499
control how I feel.

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,705
That's...

12
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,407
just between us.

13
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:47,346
(street noise)

14
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,116
(siren blaring)

15
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,387
(construction sounds)

16
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,296
Thank you.

17
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,832
(doorbell rings)

18
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,676
Hey.

19
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,357
Let's see.

20
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,894
This just slides.

21
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:10,829
Okay.

22
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,331
Um...

23
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,900
How are things with
your grandmother?

24
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:18,270
Uh, she keeps nagging me.

25
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,609
But I have two interviews
next week.

26
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,644
You do?

27
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,813
Great!

28
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,915
I'm so proud of you.

29
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:40,359
Any thoughts or feelings
you wanna share?

30
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,637
(construction sounds)

31
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,372
All right, well,
let's just say

32
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,307
we'll put in pencil
one or two more sessions,

33
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:58,410
but after that, I want you
to check in with me about it.

34
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,745
Yeah.

35
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,480
So what about Christopher?

36
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:02,915
Yeah, I think so.
I think his--

37
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,850
his confidence levels
are way up.

38
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:05,918
Mm-hm.

39
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,453
And he's continuing

40
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:11,557
to be much more active.

41
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,824
You're coming up on closure
with him.

42
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,526
Are you having anxiety
about that?

43
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,494
-No.
-Are you okay with that?

44
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,562
I am, I really don't.

45
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:19,364
I, um...

46
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,433
I mean, I care--

47
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,335
I definitely care about him.

48
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,503
-Mm-hm.
-Um...

49
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:25,737
Well, that's a given.

50
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,273
Yeah, but he--

51
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,274
you know, I think he's ready,

52
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:30,475
and I don't anticipate

53
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,912
any boundary...

54
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:34,546
issues.

55
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,547
Mm-hm.

56
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,482
Okay.

57
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,651
Okay.

58
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,588
So, Johnny Hayes.

59
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:51,296
He's been with me for about,
uh, two years,

60
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:55,367
and he has sustained problems
with intimacy.

61
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,605
Looks like some
compulsive behavior as well.

62
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,340
Mm-hm.

63
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,541
So, would you like
to meet him?

64
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,246
Yeah.

65
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,313
Well, what about your workshops?

66
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,350
They start next month, right?

67
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:14,319
I don't have to submit a draft
of my thesis until the fall,

68
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,520
so...

69
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,555
Okay.

70
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,257
So I'll set up a meeting.

71
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,760
And I guess that's--
that's it for today.

72
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,795
Thank you.

73
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,398
(siren blaring)

74
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,405
(crowd noise)

75
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,645
(muffled television)

76
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,011
(door opening)

77
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,816
Hi.

78
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,017
Hi.

79
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,753
Come on in.

80
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:05,924
How are you?

81
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,663
It's nice to see you.

82
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:18,003
So, before we get started,

83
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,505
if I could just have you
fill this out.

84
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,040
It's a confidentiality
agreement.

85
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,009
We'll both sign it.

86
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:39,458
Not for sexual gratification
or entertainment.

87
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,696
Of course.

88
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,705
Great, thank you.

89
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,107
(plastic rustling)

90
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:01,480
If you could just do me
one more favor.

91
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:03,882
Um, swipe your outer gum
and your cheek

92
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,217
in a full circle.

93
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:08,186
It's a rapid test.

94
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:09,721
You didn't get a copy
of my results?

95
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,591
I did. This is just
an additional precaution

96
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:13,925
that I take.

97
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,709
Thank you.

98
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,111
(plastic rustling)

99
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,190
Did you bring a check?

100
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:49,027
Just cash.

101
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,762
Great, thanks.

102
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,205
Uh, just leave it.

103
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,974
No, no, no, leave it on the bed.

104
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,779
(liquid pouring)

105
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,188
You want one?

106
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,091
I'm fine, thanks.

107
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:23,228
Normally I would ask
that we refrain from drinking

108
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,164
before or during a session,

109
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:30,135
um, but I'm open to talking
to Dr. Cassidy about it.

110
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,272
Understandably,
I'm sensing you have

111
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,342
a very high level
of anxiety.

112
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,915
This room okay for you?

113
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,787
Sure.

114
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,359
Tell me a little bit
about yourself.

115
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,134
We're just gonna talk today.

116
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:05,370
We're just gonna try
to create a safe space.

117
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,209
Yeah.

118
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,112
What's it like being
an anesthesiologist?

119
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,647
Nurse anesthetist.

120
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,382
Okay.

121
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,883
What's the difference?

122
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,085
Pay grade.

123
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,055
Put people to sleep
among other things.

124
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:25,090
What about stress?

125
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,826
How do you handle stress?

126
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:31,262
Have to make decisions fast,
get a result,

127
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,931
move on to the next job.

128
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,100
Mm-hm.

129
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,401
I don't like follow-ups.

130
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,370
Mm-hm.

131
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,405
So walk me through this.

132
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:44,409
You're at the hospital
all day,

133
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,844
and then you go home

134
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:49,247
and you take care
of your sister.

135
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,650
You read my file.

136
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:53,652
I did, I read your file.

137
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,024
But look,
a real person.

138
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,964
Note that the first piece
of cucumber is perfectly fine,

139
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:08,066
the first piece she eats.

140
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,402
The other one needs
to give a rock to us.

141
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:13,304
And she gets a grape
and she eats it.

142
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,674
And the other one
sees that.

143
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:16,941
She gives a rock to us now.

144
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,177
Gets again cucumber.

145
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,213
(laughing)

146
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,388
If you give them grapes,
that's a far better food,

147
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,423
then you create...

148
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,758
(phone vibrating)

149
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,326
So that's the experiment
we did.

150
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,331
(phone continues to vibrate)

151
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,472
...perfectly willing to do this
25 times in a row.

152
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:51,142
So cucumber, even though it's
really only water in my opinion,

153
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,044
but cucumber is...

154
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,449
(dog barking)

155
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,253
I wanna go down on you.

156
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,057
We can do that.

157
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,062
But I need you to take
your shirt off first.

158
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,948
I--I can't.

159
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,515
I can't do it.

160
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,283
Yes, you can.

161
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:43,294
I can't--I can't do it.

162
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,538
I can.

163
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,306
I'll do it next time.

164
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,086
(knocking at the door)

165
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,287
Hello?

166
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,490
(doorbell ringing)

167
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,433
(knocking at the door)

168
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,169
Coming!

169
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,236
(knocking at the door)

170
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,237
Anybody?

171
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,372
Yep.

172
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:39,017
-Hi, what's going on?
-Sorry.

173
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,819
Please tell me you weren't
just taking a bath.

174
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,053
Why?

175
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,165
(speaking foreign language)

176
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,403
It's leaking downstairs.

177
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,940
Uh huh, yeah.

178
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,341
It is.

179
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,986
Yeah.

180
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,388
(speaking foreign language)

181
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:22,327
We come back for more tools.

182
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,061
What?

183
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,028
Disconnect her.

184
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,497
When are you coming back?

185
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,933
I don't know.

186
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,301
Couple...

187
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,137
Okay, but how--how am I supposed
to take a shower?

188
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,977
Uh, you put the tape,

189
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,979
plastic bag and tape,
up at top.

190
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,947
Not okay.
Do you think--

191
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:44,649
can you do that
before you leave?

192
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,653
I...I said tape.

193
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,288
No, I--I understand
what you said.

194
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,156
I...

195
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,025
You put the plastic bag,

196
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,159
you know, supermarket,

197
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,127
and that's it.

198
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,428
Thank you.

199
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,563
Let's go.

200
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,165
(speaking foreign language)

201
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,135
Ah.

202
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,227
It's your choice.

203
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:32,163
You don't have to act like that

204
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,265
and I don't have to take it.

205
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,003
There's a lot of ways
for us to be together.

206
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,004
We don't have to talk,

207
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:42,273
we can just...

208
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,342
stare at each other
for 90 minutes.

209
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,077
I'm fine with that.

210
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:54,052
Okay. Let's do one
of your exercises then.

211
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,255
Grab a chair.

212
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,006
Okay.

213
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,110
You and I are gonna agree

214
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:24,515
to explore this part
of our body,

215
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:28,152
from our fingertips
to our elbow, okay?

216
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,556
One of us will be active
and one of us will be passive.

217
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,663
You wanna go first?

218
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,369
Passive.

219
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,770
Okay, I'll be active.

220
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,340
Can I have your arm?

221
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,111
Good job.

222
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,656
I don't know--
I don't know, I'm...

223
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,525
Yeah, you can go.

224
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,826
It's your turn.

225
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,801
That's nice.

226
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,436
Keep going.

227
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,686
Not yet.

228
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,324
Here

229
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,659
to here.

230
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,865
Do you want to touch my hair?

231
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,371
Yeah.

232
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,898
(door opening)

233
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:27,765
(sound of bird wings)

234
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,941
(video call)

235
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,949
Hey.

236
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:48,686
Hi, why didn't you call me back?

237
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,389
Can you see me?

238
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:52,490
Not really.

239
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:53,591
I hit accept.

240
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,393
Here, I'll do it again.

241
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,663
How about now?

242
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,701
I can hear ya.

243
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,603
You can't see me?

244
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,373
I did call you back.

245
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:11,876
Do you see me?

246
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,645
I see you.

247
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,480
And I see me.

248
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,716
No you didn't, I would know
if you called me back.

249
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,284
I mean, you did put me on a--

250
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,286
your list of priorities
or something.

251
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:24,522
What's going on, Andro?

252
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,557
Mom's missing.

253
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,393
Missing how?

254
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,229
She ran off,
she packed her suitcase,

255
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,264
even took her meds.

256
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:34,599
I don't know,
must have gone barefoot,

257
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,400
'cause her shoes are still here.

258
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,602
Mm-hm.

259
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:40,871
Okay.

260
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,575
Was anyone watching her?

261
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,944
Yes, I was--
I was watching her.

262
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:50,548
I mean, I'm also trying to watch
my kid at the same time,

263
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,782
and I don't have four eyes--

264
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:52,917
I know, Andro, I'm sorry.

265
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,285
I didn't...

266
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,419
You know, I called the cops,

267
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,454
we're two days in,

268
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,923
but you know how it is up here.

269
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:03,527
I was thinkin' about puttin'
some flyers out myself.

270
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,899
A good idea.

271
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,035
I can't find a good photo
of her,

272
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,804
it's fucked up.

273
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,740
I'm sorry.

274
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,046
Do you need money?

275
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,848
Do I--do I need money?

276
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,850
No.

277
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,652
Thanks.

278
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,428
Look, I should probably go,
okay?

279
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,764
Hey Andro, I'm sorry.

280
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:41,932
Call me back, all right?

281
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,034
Okay.

282
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:44,435
You can call me.

283
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:44,835
Okay.

284
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:45,936
Try it.

285
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:47,738
Got it.

286
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,548
Listen.

287
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,584
What we're trying to do here
is help you

288
00:22:00,586 --> 00:22:04,422
so that when you meet someone
special in your real life,

289
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,490
you can make it work out.

290
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:11,429
With Ronah, you have a kind of
professional intimacy,

291
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:15,099
which is different in its depth
of emotional bonds

292
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:19,470
and its self disclosure
than a personal relationship.

293
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:22,373
Now is there anything,
anything at all about her

294
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,975
that you do like?

295
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:26,644
Just pick anything.

296
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:29,046
Do you like the way
that she cares about you?

297
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,581
Do you like the way
that she's sincere

298
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,749
and that she really cares
about you,

299
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,884
she really wants
to help you?

300
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:36,487
(birds chirping)

301
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,891
Anything?

302
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,793
I don't know,
her hair is--

303
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,062
it's soft.

304
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:47,531
I didn't know
it could be so soft.

305
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,800
Well, okay.

306
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,369
Tell her that.

307
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,075
Tell her that.

308
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,160
(doorbell ringing)

Hey.

00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:26,670
Hi.

313
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:28,906
I made some dinner.

314
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,541
Are you hungry?

Okay.

00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,920
So, what's going on
with your bathroom?

318
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,090
Well, whatever they did,
it didn't work.

319
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:47,024
It's still leaking.

320
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,426
It's leaking again.

321
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,896
Landlord won't return my calls.

322

-Gerry, the super, he's useless.
-I know.

I can't wait to get out
of this shithole.

-So sorry.
-Yeah, me, too,

325
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:02,807
but I did due diligence, so...

326
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,975
devil may care, right?

327
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:09,580
This is really good.

328
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:10,548
Does it need salt?

329
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,082
No, it's delicious.

330
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:14,652
Thanks.

331
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:17,087
You know, I thought there was
this blond guy living here.

332
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,122
Kind of hot?

333
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:18,823
Uh, no.

Mm.

337
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:29,834
It's--actually was left here
by the previous tenant.

338
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:33,804
He sold it to me
for 22 dollars.

339
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:35,673
That's my favorite number.

340

It is?
How come?

341
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:42,580
It's a long story
involving my 22nd birthday.

00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:47,718
I just kind of arbitrarily ended
up at this bar called Love 22.

343
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,019
-I don't know that.
-Yeah, I don't think

344
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,989
it even exists anymore, but...

345
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:54,925
the bartender told me
that 22 is the love number

346
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:59,597
because if you add the numbers
on the phone that spell "love,"

347
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,602
they add up to 22, so...

348
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:05,870
just kind of stuck.

349
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:07,071
Okay.

350
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,775
So what do you do anyway?

351
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:15,012
I'm getting my Master's
in Behavioral Psychology.

352
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,183
I've just--I've done
a lot of social work.

353
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:24,788
I'm Applied Psychology.

354
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,525
I'm the PR liaison
for this start-up company.

355
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:28,959
-Mm-hm.
-We're working on an app

356
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:33,564
right now to help people
make up their minds.

357
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,833
Products, services,
pretty much anything

358
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:37,568
that can be liked.

359
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,904
(laughing)

360
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,105
Liked.

361
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,843
What?

362
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:48,212
I've seen that--
I've seen that on you before.

363
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,215
Mm.

364
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,017
It's a Buddhist symbol.

365
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,753
A square in a circle.

366
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:57,655
It's from my mom.

367
00:25:57,657 --> 00:26:01,191
Like, an old boyfriend
gave it to her or something.

368
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,060
I like it.

369
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,295
Thanks.

370
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:05,696
(phone beeping)

371
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,035
So I'm going to this gallery
opening tonight.

372
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:12,269
A friend of mine in the Village.

373
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:15,239
We're gonna go out afterwards.

374
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,975
-You got plans?
-Mm, thank you.

375
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:20,644
I have this thing
in the morning, so...

376
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:22,746
-Oh, totally.
-I can't drink.

377
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:25,316
That's fine, but thank you
for dinner.

378
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:26,884
You're welcome.

379
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:28,719
Thanks for coming over.

380
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,297
(plastic rustling)

381
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,362
(phone vibrating)

382
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,803
Hello?

383
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,242
Hello?

384
00:27:58,244 --> 00:27:59,443
(soft inhale)

385
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,447
Hello?

386
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:32,710
Okay.

387
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:36,346
Three deep breaths

388
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:39,383
while looking into
each other's eyes.

389
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,318
Less than 20 seconds.

390
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:45,389
Go.

391
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:03,741
(giggling)

392
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,389
I'm sorry.

393
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:22,025
I just had a fucking great day.

394
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,931
Had a patient die on me.

395
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:33,103
It wasn't my fault, but...

396
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,304
Your fault?

397
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,411
He reminded me of my sister.

398
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,013
His legs...

399
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,256
Johnny, do you ever feel like
maybe taking care of her

400
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:53,957
is too much?

401
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,826
Like you can't do it anymore?

402
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,230
No.

403
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,401
I...

404
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,807
I couldn't--
I could never leave her.

405
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,846
You really love
your sister?

406
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,416
Yeah.

407
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:26,423
That's a strange way to put it.

408
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,228
Don't you love your siblings?

409
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,103
You're an only child?

410
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,041
Why not?

411
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:56,186
How did you get into
this line of work?

412
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:59,423
Why are you asking me that?

413
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:15,505
I already know how to sleep
with women I don't know.

414
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,214
Do you not feel safe with me?

415
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:31,221
Now...

416
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,261
I want to strangle you.

417
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:49,640
Look.

418
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:52,242
In order for the work
that we do

419
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:57,314
in this room
to be effective,

420
00:31:57,316 --> 00:32:02,252
I need you to trust
that when I'm here with you,

421
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,655
I am completely here.

422
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:07,491
Where I live,
who I live with,

423
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:10,494
all of that stuff,

424
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,597
it really doesn't matter.

425
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,699
Can we agree on that?

426
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,672
Yeah.

427
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:23,941
Thanks.

428
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,182
You like looking at me?

429
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,958
Yeah.

430
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,297
(cell phone buzzing)

431
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,434
Sorry.

432
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:53,704
Uh, maybe this
isn't a good idea.

433
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:55,305
I'm sorry about that.

434
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,506
Uh...

435
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:06,216
You wanna talk about it?

436
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,985
I'll see you later.

437
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,289
Goodbye.

438
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:43,453
Alan, did you give my phone
number out to anybody?

439
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,255
No, of course not.

440
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,356
Are you sure?

441
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,524
100 percent. Why?

442
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,160
Why are you asking?

443
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:52,696
What's going on?

444
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:56,566
No, I'm just getting
these anonymous calls.

445
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,502
You can't caller ID it,
you can't track it?

446
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:04,608
No, it's, you know,
it's an unknown number.

447
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,509
Tell me what's going on.

448
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,177
What's going on?

449
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,578
I got it.

450
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,814
Mm-hm, but something's
getting to you.

451
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,817
Something's making you
feel uncomfortable.

452
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,389
What, I wonder?

453
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,725
I don't know,
I--I--I don't know

454
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:24,461
if it's countertransference
or what.

455
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:29,132
But what's your experience
in the session?

456
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,136
I don't know,
there's something about him

457
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:37,340
that doesn't, uh,
won't let me in, you know?

458
00:34:37,342 --> 00:34:42,279
I mean, maybe in moments,
but it--

459
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:46,483
but those are few
and far between and...

460
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:51,555
I go in with a pretty
firm resolve and a tactic

461
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,256
with something
that I feel like

462
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,192
I sort of learned
from the last session

463
00:34:55,194 --> 00:34:59,262
and then I go
to apply it and he...

464
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,432
he sort of--
he shoots it down.

465
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,202
And, um, I see him
get triggered by me,

466
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:08,872
I try
to let him know

467
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:12,109
that I'm here
and available

468
00:35:12,111 --> 00:35:14,478
and he--it--it's,
I don't know,

469
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,379
he thinks it's bullshit
or something and--

470
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:17,481
Mm-hm.

471
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:19,583
Well, remember
that empathy

472
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:21,418
is more important
than sympathy.

473
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,386
Right.

474
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:26,123
Did he talk
to you about, um,

475
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:29,392
you know, reducing
his anxiety by drinking?

476
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,862
Yeah, we talked about it.

477
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:35,165
And I said that
if it eased his anxiety,

478
00:35:35,167 --> 00:35:37,134
one drink prior to the session
was acceptable.

479
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,636
Two are not.

480
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,204
Is that okay with you?

481
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:42,172
Hm?

482
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:44,508
Yeah, it's okay.

483
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:49,412
So, uh,

484
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:53,250
how do you feel about him?

485
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:53,917
You want to continue?

486
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:54,618
I mean, how do you feel?

487
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,453
I got it.

488
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:58,655
I got it,
I can handle it.

489
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:06,463
I don't wanna give up on him,
you know?

490
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:10,934
I don't--I don't wanna...

491
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:13,537
I wanna crack him.

492
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,712
(electronic beeping)

493
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,562
Doctor, please.

494
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,468
(heartbeat)

495
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:03,453
Do you feel lightheaded at all?

496
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:04,654
Mm-mm.

497
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:09,659
We've got the magic number.

498
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,696
Twenty-three oocytes
were retrieved.

499
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:14,531
I'm guessing up
to 20 of those

500
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:16,366
will be mature and suitable
for preservation.

501
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:18,501
That's almost twice
as much as last time.

502
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:19,803
You did great.

503
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,571
I think you're
perfectly safe now.

504
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,541
There's no need for you
to undergo another cycle.

505
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:25,942
Are you sure?

506
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,010
We got you.

507
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:29,012
Save your money.

508
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:31,915
Buy something else
for yourself.

509
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,918
Tomorrow we should have
the definite results.

510
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,387
Just remember,
light daily activities

511
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,855
starting tomorrow.

512
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:41,524
No hard work,
no hot baths,

513
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:44,461
no sauna for
at least five days.

514
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:46,663
And no unprotected
sexual relations

515
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:48,765
until your next
menstrual cycle.

516
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,734
Sounds good.

517
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:52,602
Someone driving you home?

518
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,805
I live nearby,
I'll be fine.

519
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,809
The front desk will call
a cab for you.

520
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,485
(horns honking)

521
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,976
I wanted to be a clinician,
too, you know,

522
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,611
when I was younger.

523
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:36,479
But then things just
took off on their own

524
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,983
and it was a different time,
early '80s.

525
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:40,950
But I think it's great
that you're getting

526
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:42,352
your master's degree.

527
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:44,854
It puts you in
a much better position,

528
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:47,924
also from
a legal standpoint.

529
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,659
How many people
are in this class?

530
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,696
Uh, this year there's seven
plus the two of us.

531
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:54,030
Should be fun.

532
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:55,632
We get to spend some time
and come back.

533
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,934
Not bad.

534
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,536
Irene, can I ask you something?

535
00:38:59,538 --> 00:39:01,838
Of course.

536
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
Spit it out.

537
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,576
So, I want to buy
an apartment in the city,

538
00:39:06,578 --> 00:39:10,547
a place to have my own practice
in a couple of years

539
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,782
once I get my license
and all that.

540
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:16,086
And I was looking into
a no-doc mortgage,

541
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:17,721
which means
that I wouldn't

542
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:20,457
have to disclose
any of my income,

543
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:25,729
just my credit score,
but I would need a cosigner.

544
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,532
It's...

545
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:30,533
(sighs)

546
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,502
...a big commitment.

547
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,671
An apartment, I mean...

548
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,808
I'd have to think about it.

549
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,810
I completely understand.

550
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:10,573
Hey, Alan,
it's Ronah.

551
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,576
Did Johnny Hayes
cancel with you?

552
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,845
If you get this
within the next 15 minutes,

553
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:18,047
uh, please give me
a call back.

554
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,422
(door opens)

555
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:28,925
Hi.

556
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:31,861
Hi.

557
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:34,731
Long shift, my phone died,
and I'm sorry.

558
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,599
It's okay.

559
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,875
I'm not really
in the mood to talk.

560
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,582
I'm not either.

I had this business idea.

590
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,691
Hi, I'm Harry,

591
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:50,360
and I'm no longer with you.

592
00:43:50,362 --> 00:43:52,328
He has cancer.

593
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,930
As some of you know...

594
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:54,931
You made this?

595
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:56,265
And most of you
may suspect,

596
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:57,667
I was quite a happy kid.

597
00:43:57,669 --> 00:43:59,302
I'm starting a website.

598
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,970
Loved the outdoors.

599
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,905
Online obituaries.

600
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:04,874
Love my sisters...

601
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:06,809
You shoot the video
before they pass away.

602
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,311
...most of the time.

603
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:10,413
It's for their friends
and family, really.

604
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:12,048
Just loved
being on my own

605
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,883
out in the woods
and the stream.

606
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:16,019
Great.

607
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:17,353
Remember...

608
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:19,055
Really, you think so?

609
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:21,257
...of trekking
through the woods,

610
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:22,792
finding secret places.

611
00:44:22,794 --> 00:44:23,359
Yeah.

612
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:24,661
Discovering...

613
00:44:24,663 --> 00:44:25,995
I really think so.

614
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,798
Mark hunting,
never got anything,

615
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,366
never shot anything.

616
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,103
(birds chirping)

617
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:38,675
Bye, Chris.

618
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,899
Hi, I'm unable to take
your call right now.

619
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:04,400
Please leave a message.

620
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:05,802

621
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,240
(phone hangs up)

622
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:30,026
Excuse me.

623
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:34,363
Hi, that, um,
video camera in the lobby,

624
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:37,233
does it cover the street
as well?

625
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,735
You mean by the elevator?

626
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:39,368
Yeah.

627
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,237
Not anymore.

628
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,905
Years ago
there was a problem.

629
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:46,909
Someone was sleeping
in the basement.

630
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:49,812
So are you telling me that
it doesn't work at all?

631
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:52,348
No need to.

632
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,750
Can--

633
00:45:55,986 --> 00:46:00,189
You know what,
I'll talk to the landlord.

634
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,292
9D, right?

635
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,795
9D what?

636
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07,396
They couldn't get in today.

637
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:08,965
What are you
talking about?

638
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:12,201
The plumbers,
you missed your appointment.

639
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:24,914
(beep)

640
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:26,482
Janusz Kubicek.

641
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:28,451
Leave a message.

642
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,987
Hi, this is the third time
I'm calling.

643
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:33,156
Please give me a call back.

644
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:36,225
I really need those holes
sealed in my bathroom.

645
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:37,927
It's been weeks.

646
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,571
You have a nice body.

647
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:29,972
(scoffs)

648
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:35,011
You do.

649
00:48:35,013 --> 00:48:36,212
(laughs dryly)

650
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:46,455
So do you.

651
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,091
You okay?

652
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:28,264
Sorry.

653
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:29,465
It's okay.

654
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,638
I just, uh...

655
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,640
It's all the thoughts.

656
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:47,416
It's a muscle memory,
it's just...

657
00:49:47,418 --> 00:49:50,686
The body is a funny thing.

658
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:53,289
(sirens)

659
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:58,160
Go, go again.

660
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,301
Go again.

661
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:27,556
Um, it's not contagious,
but it's--

662
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:29,525
there are parts
of your body

663
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,627
where the skin
just goes crazy.

664
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,562
It actually, like,
this isn't an exaggeration,

665
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:38,134
it grows a thousand times
faster than regular skin,

666
00:50:38,136 --> 00:50:41,270
and so it builds up into, like,
they call it a plaque,

667
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:43,806
but it just, like,
it looks like a scab,

668
00:50:43,808 --> 00:50:45,441
like a scab of skin.

669
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:47,243
I understand.

670
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,283
I'm not afraid of it.

671
00:50:58,588 --> 00:50:59,789
(laughs)

672
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,636
If anything
comes up,

673
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:16,172
you can always
talk to Dr. Cassidy.

674
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:20,743
(laughs)

675
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,518
You're different today.

676
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,123
Guess I'm trying
to meet you halfway.

677
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,264
Are you hot?

678
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:48,204
What?

679
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:50,573
Are you hot?

680
00:51:50,575 --> 00:51:52,108
I'm really hot.

681
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:54,543
Kind of.

682
00:51:54,545 --> 00:51:56,278
I don't believe that.

683
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,681
(murmuring)

684
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,552
(giggles)

685
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,493
What now?

686
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:16,565
Why don't you try
being active?

687
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:19,735
I can stay like this
or I can go on my belly.

688
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:25,341
This is fine.

689
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:59,575
Do you inject yourself?

690
00:52:59,577 --> 00:53:01,477
It's nothing to worry about.

691
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:03,879
They're just--
they're hormone shots.

692
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,752
Do you have high testosterone
levels or?

693
00:53:09,754 --> 00:53:13,189
No, I'm...

694
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:15,791
I'm freezing my eggs.

695
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:17,893
Cryopreservation.

696
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:20,930
Do they pay you a lot?

697
00:53:20,932 --> 00:53:24,433
No, I'm freezing
my eggs for myself.

698
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:26,435
Why?

699
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:32,608
Why?

700
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,517
Because I might want
to have a baby one day.

701
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,864
So you don't
have a boyfriend?

702
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:00,903
No.

703
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:03,906
I don't.

she lived with us

when mom started to crack?

The bug spray she used
to rub all over herself

like it was lotion?

731

Yeah, it smelled awful.

732
00:57:36,587 --> 00:57:37,986
Bet she used it
to get high.

Mm.

Oh.

How was your day?

742
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,258
It was uneventful,
no one died.

743
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,860
You're really helping
people feel better.

744
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:20,028
That must be rewarding.

That why you're in
the medical field,

because it's rewarding?

747
00:58:24,535 --> 00:58:29,671
Yeah, I mean,
I guess you could say that.

I get to see
people change.

749

Okay.

00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,015
What?

00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:47,856
I'm happy to see you.

752
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:50,826
What--why would you say that?

753
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:56,565
Because it's the truth?

754
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,941
No, because you think
you've got me all figured out.

755
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:09,978
Mm, no, I...

756
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,547
I don't.

757
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:12,848
I'm so sorry.

758
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:15,183
Can you just give me
one second?

Nothing, I, uh,
I just looked--

764
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:19,948
Okay.

765
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,016
Your phone made a sound.

766
01:00:21,018 --> 01:00:21,950
No, Johnny.

767
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,286
Johnny, you can't...

768
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:25,687
You can't go through
my phone,

769
01:00:25,689 --> 01:00:27,255
you can't look in my bag.

770
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:28,957
If you were with a woman,
then she wouldn't

771
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,192
be able to trust you.
You know,

772
01:00:30,194 --> 01:00:32,060
you can't do things
like that.

773
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:33,762
I'm--I'm sorry.

774
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:38,667
I'm sorry.

775
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:41,937
I'm sorry.

776
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:43,338
It's okay.

777
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:51,647
I want to know about
the women that you sleep with.

778
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,184
Does it matter?

779
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:58,186
Yeah, I wanna know
who they are.

780
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,057
Co-workers?

781
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:04,359
My co-workers?

782
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:06,995
Yeah, are there women
on the floor where you work,

783
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:08,964
doctors, nurses?

784
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:12,768
No.

785
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:14,336
Don't shit where you eat
kind of thing.

786
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:21,877
What? I said I was sorry.

787
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:23,211
Okay.

788
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:31,787
Come here.

789
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,757
Hm?

790
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:38,126
Come here.

01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:48,530

(moaning)

793
01:03:03,913 --> 01:03:04,513
Hi, Alan.

794
01:03:04,515 --> 01:03:06,448
Uh, it's Ronah.

795
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:08,950
We made some progress today
with Johnny Hayes.

796
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:12,254
We moved to genital touching,
as you suggested.

797
01:03:12,256 --> 01:03:15,090
He was, uh,
he was present throughout.

798
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:16,458
There was also
a major improvement

799
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,894
in his ED.

800
01:03:18,896 --> 01:03:22,197
He sustained eye contact
before and after,

801
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:23,532
and, uh, yeah,

802
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:27,235
I--I think this could be
a turning point for him.

803
01:03:27,237 --> 01:03:29,838
(pigeons cooing)

804
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:35,010
Well, maybe you should move
to California, you know?

805
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:40,081
Better community,
better therapists.

806
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:41,817
People aren't so uptight.

807
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:44,352
It's really important
to see people outside the job.

808
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:47,956
Yeah, I know, but...
everybody's different.

809
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:49,858
No, I'm just sayin'.
You...

810
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,160
need to take care
of yourself first, you know?

811
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,329
Don't worry.

812
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,331
You know, I'm seeing
three clients right now,

813
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:58,333
and I just don't know
what I would do

814
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,502
if I had a boyfriend
on top of that.

815
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:17,853
I was never good at seeing
more than one client at a time.

816
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:19,521
Are you seeing any clients
right now?

817
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:21,957
I enjoy teaching;
it keeps me busy.

818
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:25,493
I had a difficult one.

819
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:26,862
He fell in love with you?

820
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:29,030
No, not this one.

821
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:31,967
So how do you handle that,
though?

822
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:33,501
What do you--
you know,

823
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:36,638
what do you do when you feel
like that could happen?

824
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,139
I just don't use deodorant
the next time,

825
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:39,441
you know what I mean?

826
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:41,243
Okay.

827
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:44,246
What if...

828
01:04:44,248 --> 01:04:46,514
what if it's the other way
around?

829
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:49,017
Oh, it happens,
it happens.

830
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:50,218
That'd be nice.

831
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,553
Yeah.

832
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:53,421
Can be kinda nice.

833
01:04:58,094 --> 01:05:00,228
I do really feel like
I'm getting so much better

834
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:03,999
at feeling things
and then just moving on.

835
01:05:04,001 --> 01:05:05,667
And growing.

836
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:07,302
You know, I think what I find
the most difficult

837
01:05:07,304 --> 01:05:10,138
is when they--when they just
don't get better.

838
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:13,275
You know, this last one I had
a couple of years ago,

839
01:05:13,277 --> 01:05:14,576
I just felt like
I couldn't help him.

840
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,945
You know, he was too damaged.

841
01:05:16,947 --> 01:05:18,513
At first I thought
he was attractive,

842
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:22,617
manly, with sensitive eyes,
you know?

843
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:26,221
The kind of man that you want
to be with right from the start.

844
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:30,091
So what was his problem?

845
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:31,226
Hm,

846
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:34,562
terrified, terrifying kind.

847
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:35,997
Couldn't look me in the eyes,

848
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:39,301
and when I asked
to take his hand,

849
01:05:39,303 --> 01:05:41,369
he just laughed at me
and said,

850
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:43,972
"Well, why don't you take
my cock instead?"

851
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:46,641
So I ask him,

852
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:50,111
"Do you feel guilty
being hard right now?"

853
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:52,981
And he just...

854
01:05:52,983 --> 01:05:54,082
went at me.

855
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:56,618
I mean, really.

856
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:59,487
You know, if you can't
gently pull someone

857
01:05:59,489 --> 01:06:01,423
because they won't allow it,

858
01:06:01,425 --> 01:06:04,326
all you can do is push.

859
01:06:04,328 --> 01:06:05,660
Or leave.

860
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:09,397
So then what happened?

861
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:11,566
Nothing.

862
01:06:11,568 --> 01:06:13,535
Very small community.

863
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,567
(doorbell ringing)

864
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,676
Who is it?

865
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:56,411
It's me.

866
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:31,546
Look, I hate to be the one
telling you,

867
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:36,184
but this letter you got
is bad news.

868
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:39,054
Seems like you've been using
an illegal washer-dryer.

869
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:40,422
Broken pipe in your apartment,

870
01:07:40,424 --> 01:07:41,756
severe damage to the one below.

871
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:43,358
The bathroom needs
to be renovated.

872
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,693
That machine was installed
before I moved in.

873
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:47,462
I spoke with the case manager.

874
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:48,563
Since you're the one
in violation,

875
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:49,564
the insurance won't pay.

876
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,299
You may become uninsurable,

877
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:52,534
but that's another issue.

878
01:07:52,536 --> 01:07:54,602
That doesn't make any sense.

879
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:57,238
Your neighbor is suing
the landlord,

880
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,707
and he's suing you.

881
01:07:59,709 --> 01:08:01,843
Why is my neighbor suing?

882
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:04,479
She claims she slipped
and fell.

883
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:06,548
It's a smart move if she can
prove he's in default.

884
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,749
Um, Marty, she's lying.

885
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:10,552
I saw her,
she's perfectly fine.

886
01:08:10,554 --> 01:08:13,088
The building isn't washer-dryer
approved, Ronah.

887
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:16,558
The fact is you violated
the contractual agreement.

888
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,226
They seemed very serious
about it,

889
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:20,128
and if I were you,
I wouldn't want to go to court.

890
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,463
You'll be asked
a lot of questions

891
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:23,765
that you may not want
to answer.

892
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,433
On the other hand,
if we try to settle,

893
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:27,802
we're talking months
at the very least.

894
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:30,171
In all honesty,
I can't do this pro bono.

895

Yeah.

01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:19,053
let me know what my options are?

1006
01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:21,055
I'm not sure
I want to press charges,

1007
01:19:21,057 --> 01:19:24,325
I just wanted to make sure
that I...

1008
01:19:24,327 --> 01:19:28,229
that it was on file
in some way.

1009
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,365
We've seen a lot of cases
just like this.

1010
01:19:31,367 --> 01:19:33,534
Let me tell you what
I tell everyone else.

1011
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:35,536
There's no excuse
for what he did to you,

1012
01:19:35,538 --> 01:19:37,938
it's a serious violation.

1013
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,174
We see that you're hurt,

1014
01:19:40,176 --> 01:19:43,210
so our job is to proceed
from here. You with me?

1015
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:46,013
Yeah, but could you just
give me a breakdown

1016
01:19:46,015 --> 01:19:48,449
as to how these kinds
of cases usually go?

1017
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:50,217
I mean, does he--
is he arrested?

1018
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:53,120
Does he just have
to go to court, or...?

1019
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:55,923
You can't worry about
any of that now.

1020
01:19:55,925 --> 01:19:59,326
What we focus on
is how to protect you or others.

1021
01:19:59,328 --> 01:20:01,295
We can get you
an order of protection

1022
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:03,364
so that he cannot contact you,
call you,

1023
01:20:03,366 --> 01:20:05,366
or approach you
in any way.

1024
01:20:05,368 --> 01:20:08,102
We want you to feel safe.

1025
01:20:08,104 --> 01:20:12,273
You mind if I get some pictures
of the injuries you sustained?

1026
01:20:12,275 --> 01:20:14,041
Yeah, that's fine.

1027
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:19,880
Can I just--can I finish this
first?

1028
01:20:19,882 --> 01:20:21,282
There you go.

1029
01:20:21,284 --> 01:20:23,050
There's no rush.

1030
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:25,920
We'll get you to the ER.

1031
01:20:25,922 --> 01:20:27,421
You'll feel better soon.

1032
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:31,091
May I use your bathroom?

1033
01:20:31,093 --> 01:20:32,827
It's right around the corner,
honey.

1034
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:36,163
Take a left and then a right
at the end of the hall.

1035
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,298
It's a unisex.

1036
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,600
Thanks. I'll be right back.

I--I enjoyed being...

Is this an emergency, Robert?

I've thought it through

1064
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:39,613
and I'd like you to settle

1065
01:23:39,615 --> 01:23:41,348
with them for a percentage.

1066
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,517
You'll get 30 percent

on top of your hourly rate,

1068

so there's really no need
to call me back.
