1
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:26,705
She's handling like a sled!

2
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,710
What's going on
back there?

3
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,008
Just the cargo shifting,
Captain.

4
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:34,346
Check it out!

5
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:38,080
Yes, sir.
I'll check it out.

6
00:00:56,272 --> 00:00:59,708
The hold-down straps
are tight, Captain.

7
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:17,052
Captain, I think there's
something moving around in here.

8
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:20,358
Dave, I bleed easy!
Look inside that cargo!

9
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,444
What have you got?

10
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,606
I'm trying to get
the crate open, sir.

11
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,309
Sir, there are warning signs
all over this thing.

12
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:43,318
I don't think
this is such a good idea.

13
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:47,618
It's top secret, but go ahead.
You've got my permission. Open it up.

14
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,734
There ain't nothing
in here, sir.

15
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:10,746
Oh, my God.

16
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:15,549
<i>Dave!</i>

17
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:22,655
Dave, what the hell
is going on back there?

18
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:29,797
<i>What the hell...</i>

19
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,511
<i>No!</i>

20
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:09,398
<i>Oh, yeah. Right there.</i>

21
00:03:09,472 --> 00:03:11,702
Oh, yeah.

22
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,208
Oh, right there.

23
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,211
Robert, you...

24
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,049
- What did you say?
- Why did you stop?

25
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:25,884
- You just called me Robert.
- No, no, no.

26
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,220
- I said Roberta.
- No, you said Robert.

27
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,726
There was no "ta"
at the end of it.

28
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,228
Roberta...

29
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:47,072
please excuse my improper
alliteration in a moment of ecstasy.

30
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:51,580
I promise, next time
I will get your name right.

31
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,587
Look, I'm sorry.

32
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,427
I know that you
see guys sometimes.

33
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,589
I just hope
I'm the only girl you see.

34
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,691
You are
the only girl I see.

35
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,772
That feels good.

36
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,108
Oh, not so tight.

37
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,273
Not so tight.

38
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,783
What's too tight?

39
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:34,719
- Jesus Christ, you're scaring her.
- "Scaring her"?

40
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,725
She's just
giving you a hug.

41
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:39,626
- Hi, baby.
- I don't know why you had to bring that overgrown worm.

42
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,631
I hate that thing.
It could have bitten me!

43
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,795
Lady G is a python.
She doesn't bite, she squeezes.

44
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,803
<i>Besides,
I can't leave her at home alone.</i>

45
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,704
- Wherever I go, she goes.
- Yeah.

46
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,178
- Where you gonna go?
- I gotta take a leak.

47
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,813
Looks like you've been
up here before.

48
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:42,357
A few times.

49
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,394
<i>- Who's John?
- John?</i>

50
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:48,487
No, you mean Joanna.

51
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:51,158
Bitch.

52
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:53,964
- What was that?
- Nothing.

53
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,228
Roberta?

54
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,389
This isn't funny!

55
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:27,896
Roberta?

56
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,905
Roberta?

57
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,402
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

58
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,469
No.

59
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,727
God, no! No!

60
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,638
Hey, Greg.

61
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,911
This isn't
a racing circuit, Cooper.

62
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,046
<i>You keep riding
like that,</i>

63
00:09:33,122 --> 00:09:35,249
somebody's gonna get hurt.

64
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,132
<i>Shit!</i>

65
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,973
<i>Pretty damn funny, huh?</i>

66
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,951
- Yep.
- There she blows!

67
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,987
Are you out of your minds?

68
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,616
Do you know what happens
when that goes past the red?

69
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:46,355
<i>Quit screwing around
in here!</i>

70
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:48,522
For Christ's sake, Brian,
leave the door open!

71
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:51,031
<i>We're dying in here!</i>

72
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:05,109
Take it up with the city. We leave the
big door open, we're gonna get cited.

73
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,684
A $500-per-incident fýne?

74
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,378
That door is the only
ventilation we have.

75
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:18,154
<i>- Close that, we'll all end up with brain
damage. - You won't get brain-damaged.</i>

76
00:11:18,227 --> 00:11:21,287
That's what you think. You see
those two vapor monkeys over there?

77
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:23,958
<i>Those two are
permanently defective.</i>

78
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:27,161
I don't want to end up like that or keeled
over with some dopey grin on my face.

79
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:30,137
Like Dad?

80
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:35,337
- The city will close us down if we don't
keep buttoned-up. - OSHA will if we do.

81
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:39,040
That's the point, John. They want to shut
us down. They're looking for an excuse.

82
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,051
I'm not gonna let them bury everything
Dad spent a lifetime building for us,

83
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:47,556
so a bunch of snobs can sit around
sipping lattes and munching on biscotti!

84
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:54,854
Brian... Dad died trying
to keep this place open.

85
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,524
I don't think that's what
he really wanted for us.

86
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,398
What do you know about what Dad
wanted? You weren't even here.

87
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,132
That's Tommy.
I gotta go.

88
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,700
Then go. Leave.

89
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,476
<i>That's what you do best,
ain't it, John?</i>

90
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,194
Hey, Johnny,
how you doing?

91
00:12:35,271 --> 00:12:38,263
Great.
Peachy.

92
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,039
<i>- Where are the girls?
- They're gonna meet us at the lake.</i>

93
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,946
- Do you love him?
- Oh, God, of course I do.

94
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,456
I've loved Tommy
ever since I fýrst saw him...

95
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,754
on the monkey bars
in second grade.

96
00:12:57,827 --> 00:13:00,955
I've been in love with Theresa
since the time I saw her...

97
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,397
in that tight varsity sweater
our freshman year.

98
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:07,630
So when do you think he'll fýnally
get around to asking you the question?

99
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,796
At the rate he's going...
never.

100
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:13,638
All he ever talks about is sex and...

101
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,643
Money.

102
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,737
These days
it is all about money.

103
00:13:18,814 --> 00:13:20,805
- You don't care about money?
- Heck, no.

104
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,647
I'd live in a trailer park
with Tommy if he'd ask me,

105
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,914
but all he ever talks about
is this damn...

106
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:29,651
- Kenny the Closer?
- Kenny the Closer!

107
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,818
The man's a legend.
He's an icon.

108
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,990
He's the number one selling real estate
agent in the entire southwestern corridor.

109
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,499
There is no way I'm gonna ask
Theresa to marry me...

110
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,593
until I'm pulling down bucks
like Kenny the Closer.

111
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,003
Theresa doesn't care about
your money. She loves you, man.

112
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,939
If that's the case,
how come she won't...

113
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:49,000
You never
slept with Tommy?

114
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,876
- Nope, not once.
- Why not?

115
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:54,438
We did come close
a couple times, but...

116
00:13:54,517 --> 00:13:57,509
What if we get married
and the fýrst time we do it...

117
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,612
it's like really bad sex?

118
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:04,785
Tommy, there's no such thing
as really bad sex.

119
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,880
Hey.

120
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,518
How's your brother?

121
00:14:31,587 --> 00:14:35,148
Dying slowly from toxic fumes.
He just doesn't know it yet.

122
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:39,086
You keep working there,
he'll be taking you with him.

123
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:42,221
- Hello.
- Hello.

124
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,226
That's what
you came back for?

125
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:50,261
Nah... not for that.

126
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,603
I never did thank you.

127
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:56,873
For what, wrecking
your engagement with Greg?

128
00:14:56,946 --> 00:15:01,906
No... from saving me
from a big mistake.

129
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,953
I like saving you.

130
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:10,448
<i>- Come on, you weenies! Let's go!
- Tommy, you are so dead!</i>

131
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,687
<i>Get in here.</i>

132
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,606
John!

133
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,081
<i>- What happened?
- What?</i>

134
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,118
<i>Easy.
It's all right.</i>

135
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,121
Hey.

136
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,282
Easy, girl.
Easy.

137
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,451
<i>John...</i>

138
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,924
- It's okay.
- What are you doing?

139
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:51,125
Easy, girl.

140
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,998
- Oh, my God, that's Lady G.
- Who?

141
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:56,003
- It's Lisa's.
- It's Lisa's.

142
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:59,768
<i>- I'm not even going to ask
how both of you know that.</i>

143
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:02,970
What you got there,
Cooper?

144
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,378
That's Lisa's snake,
isn't it?

145
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:11,849
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

146
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,582
You think I came all the way
up here just to spy on you?

147
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:17,820
- Didn't you?
- Guys, this is offýcial.

148
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,191
<i>A missing persons report.</i>

149
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:23,095
Lisa didn't show up
at home this morning.

150
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:25,326
She's a bit
on the wild side.

151
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:29,861
- You'd know, wouldn't you? You used to date her.
- Everybody used to date her.

152
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:34,170
<i>Greg... Deputy Greg, come in.
We found something.</i>

153
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,768
- Let me take that.
- Please do.

154
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,178
God, you're such a girl.

155
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,279
- How do you know Lisa?
- Everybody knows Lisa.

156
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:56,687
So, what do you think?

157
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,858
I don't know what to think.

158
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,698
I don't know what
to think either.

159
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,705
You ever seen anything
like this before?

160
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,707
Never.

161
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,868
Neither have I.

162
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,209
Any idea what
might have caused it?

163
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,374
Nothing in my mind.

164
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,884
Nothing in my mind either.

165
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,229
What you got, Griff?

166
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,824
We think we found
Lisa's body. It's not pretty.

167
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,161
Oh, no.

168
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:40,231
- Didn't you used to date her?
- Everybody used to date her.

169
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,334
Gotta tell you,
Griff,

170
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:46,575
whoever pulled this one
has a real mean streak.

171
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,880
<i>- She's burned to the bone.
- Yeah, but with what?</i>

172
00:17:50,953 --> 00:17:55,049
I guess an acid;
sulfuric, hydrochloric.

173
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:57,524
Battery.

174
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:59,458
I don't know.

175
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:08,092
I won't know more
until I get her up on the table.

176
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,730
To tell you the truth...

177
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:13,866
this looks more like an
industrial accident than a murder.

178
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:18,106
This was no accident. Rose and
I saw Lisa and that snake of hers...

179
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,115
leave the diner last night
with Roberta Keeler.

180
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,117
Nobody's
seen her since either.

181
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:32,616
All I know is
burns like that don't happen...

182
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,492
<i>just going
for a midnight swim.</i>

183
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,144
What you got, Greg?

184
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,477
John Cooper.

185
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,847
Just ran into him
over at the watering hole.

186
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:59,854
He had Lisa's snake
with him.

187
00:18:59,922 --> 00:19:04,985
He has been working over at Perfecto
with his brother since he got back.

188
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,824
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
With all that acid.

189
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,660
What do you think, Griff?
Worth a little talk with him?

190
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,962
I don't know.

191
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:15,333
<i>If that's Lisa,
where's Roberta?</i>

192
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,032
Is she missing?
Did she do this?

193
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:22,475
I guess it wouldn't hurt to see
what John was up to last night.

194
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:24,478
- Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

195
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:26,844
- I'll get an A.P.B. Out for Keeler too.
- Good.

196
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,848
- This is great!
- What's great?

197
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,684
We fýnally get to grill that asshole
who stole your girl.

198
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,690
What do you mean,
"we get to grill"?

199
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,192
- You're not gonna grill him?
- I didn't say that.

200
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,355
I knew it. I knew it.
Good cop, bad cop.

201
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,525
When we are done with him, he's
gonna be confessing to the J.F.K. Hit.

202
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,695
- When do we start?
- I got it covered, Lou.

203
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,534
What do you mean?
You're not gonna let me help?

204
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,201
Come on,
you gotta let me help.

205
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,710
I promise, I won't say a thing.
I'll be a fly on the wall.

206
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,214
- Please, please?
- All right, but you don't say one word.

207
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,546
- Not one word.
- Not one word.

208
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,479
<i>Now listen to this.</i>

209
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:09,547
I'm supposed to be showing
the Baxter place tomorrow.

210
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,219
Two bedrooms, two bathrooms.

211
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:17,231
Six percent of 150 K,
I haven't run the comps yet.

212
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,060
Oh, shit!

213
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,229
What?

214
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,240
I was gonna take some Polaroids
to go with the comps,

215
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,243
and I left the damn camera
at the Red Stone Estates.

216
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,246
No biggie. Just pick it up
after you drop me off.

217
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:36,080
- I can't. I've gotta get back to the offýce.
- Pick it up afterwards.

218
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,085
Theresa and I are going
to the show tonight.

219
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,747
If we don't get out by 5:00,
there's no way we're gonna make it.

220
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:45,191
- I am so screwed!
- I'll get it for you.

221
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,751
- Would you?
- Yeah.

222
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:52,698
- Thanks, man. That's very cool.
- No sweat.

223
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:55,931
Hey, hey, Tommy!

224
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,370
You gonna close the deal
on that Baxter place tomorrow?

225
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,932
- I hope so.
- Hope is for losers, kid.

226
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,140
<i>You gotta know so. I'm showing
Red Stone tonight, model D.</i>

227
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:09,650
<i>Prospect is hot to trot!
You think I'm hoping?</i>

228
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:12,414
Hell no!
Hey, hey!

229
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:15,820
<i>You scratch it, I'll hang your balls
like fuzzy dice from my mirror!</i>

230
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:20,294
You got that, Billy?
You piece of monkey shit!

231
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,297
Anyway, I'm gonna
ask you one more time.

232
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,061
This is Kenny the Closer
that's asking you.

233
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:28,159
- Are you gonna close that deal?
- Yeah.

234
00:21:28,236 --> 00:21:30,602
- Are you gonna close that deal?
- Oh, yeah.

235
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:33,835
- Are you gonna close that deal?
- Hell, yeah!

236
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:37,140
That's the ticket! Cuh-ching, baby!

237
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,823
What's going on?

238
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,727
Somebody gone out
and got themselves murdered.

239
00:21:55,797 --> 00:21:58,493
- Murdered?
- Yeah, Louis told us.

240
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:02,298
- Where? Here?
- No, up at the reservoir last night.

241
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:04,339
<i>Lisa Johnson.</i>

242
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,374
You know that's crazy.

243
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:10,275
He may be irresponsible,
but there's no way he would...

244
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,014
<i>Hey.</i>

245
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,019
Brian.

246
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:28,187
<i>Why don't you
sit down for this?</i>

247
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,528
It's all right.
I'd rather stand.

248
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,738
Where were you last night
between 10:00 and 12:00?

249
00:22:36,805 --> 00:22:39,399
You think I murdered Lisa?

250
00:22:39,474 --> 00:22:42,739
"Murdered"? Nobody said
anything about a murder.

251
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,673
What makes you think
there was a murder?

252
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:51,583
- Lenny and Boone told me.
- How did they know?

253
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:53,416
They said you told them.

254
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:55,888
Oh, yeah.
I guess I did.

255
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,552
- Louis, why don't you let...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, fýne,

256
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,597
but I'll be
watching you, mister.

257
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:12,507
So?

258
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:14,906
Come on, Greg.

259
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:17,604
Are you gonna answer the question?
Where were you last night?

260
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,108
I was at Kristin's place.

261
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,455
Is she willing
to confýrm that?

262
00:23:27,522 --> 00:23:31,754
Of course she would.
Here, ask her yourself.

263
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,125
You want me to dial?

264
00:23:34,196 --> 00:23:38,132
I know the number.

265
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,273
<i>Yes, my liebchen.</i>

266
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,774
Yes.

267
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,950
Time to work.

268
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,962
Dr. Rudolph?

269
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,126
<i>- Yes.
- Special Agent Parker would like to see you now, sir.</i>

270
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:17,638
What took you so long?

271
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,197
Oh, Mrs. Garibaldi...

272
00:24:46,268 --> 00:24:48,202
you look absolutely
gorgeous today.

273
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,001
Francesca, please.
You're so sweet.

274
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,337
So, what have you got
for me today?

275
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,674
Something that will
excite me, I hope.

276
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,680
Follow me.

277
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:19,526
Use your imagination, Mrs...
I mean, Francesca.

278
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:24,538
- That is such a beautiful name.
- Thank you.

279
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:27,541
My late husband used to
call me Fran. Can you believe it?

280
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,045
Oh, you are anything
but a Fran.

281
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:35,708
Imagine a cool winter night,

282
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:41,381
you and the one you love
staring into the flames,

283
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,550
- maybe a little incense,
- Yeah.

284
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:48,392
- Candlelight.
- Ooh, you make me want it right now.

285
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,057
Let me show you what
I've got in the back.

286
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,896
- I'd rather see
what you've got in front.

287
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,903
Now, now, now.

288
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,236
The master suite.

289
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,583
Isn't it beautiful?

290
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,248
- Just use your imagination.
- Oh, I am.

291
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:24,262
And now...

292
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,960
my very favorite room...

293
00:26:27,035 --> 00:26:29,094
in Red Stone Estates.

294
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,950
Floating camellias.

295
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,452
Shall I?

296
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,454
Please do.

297
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,669
What the hell
have you gotten us into?

298
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,344
This is horrible.

299
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,939
- Such a loss.
- You knew those men?

300
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:51,508
Not the men, the specimen.

301
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,554
<i>You can always get more men,</i>

302
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:58,058
but the specimen
is irreplaceable.

303
00:27:58,126 --> 00:28:03,530
What exactly
do you do, Doctor?

304
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,691
I'm a herpetologist.

305
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,828
- You specialize in reptiles.
- Mm-hmm.

306
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:13,032
Is that was Biogene
was transporting?

307
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:18,375
Not in the traditional sense,
no.

308
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,882
What, um...

309
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,819
What we had
was something unique.

310
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:29,923
An evolutionary camera...

311
00:28:29,991 --> 00:28:32,858
of immense physiological scale.

312
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:37,728
Something with unparalleled
abilities and characteristics.

313
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,734
A hybrid, if you will,

314
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:43,236
integrated from a variety...

315
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,740
of distinct serpentine species.

316
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:51,142
You hide behind
a lot of big words, Doctor,

317
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:54,909
but what you just said still doesn't
tell us what we need to know.

318
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:58,043
<i>We know the flight
originated in Southeast Asia.</i>

319
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,713
<i>The authorization came
from the State Department...</i>

320
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:02,882
for the use
of a transport out of Guam,

321
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:05,755
but nowhere in the manifest
is there so much as a mention...

322
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,920
of exactly what it was
you were transporting.

323
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:13,457
So I'm asking you, Doctor,
in simple, laymen's terms...

324
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:18,666
what... was... it?

325
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:25,105
In simple, laymen's terms...

326
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:30,450
a very big snake.

327
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:36,123
<i>Oh, my God,
it's huge! It's enormous!</i>

328
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,955
<i>- I just can't handle it! It's too much!
- Yes, you can.</i>

329
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:41,086
<i>You can do it, baby.
I know you can!</i>

330
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:45,496
Thirty percent down, 8.9 percent
fýnancing for the fýrst two years.

331
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:49,833
- You can do it, baby!
- Oh, it's just so much more than I expected.

332
00:29:49,904 --> 00:29:55,069
Isn't there anything I can do
to get you to go down?

333
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:58,278
All right.

334
00:29:58,346 --> 00:30:02,146
Twenty percent down,
8.5 percent fýnancing...

335
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,310
with a ballooning
mortgage to 12.9.

336
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,319
That's the best deal
you're gonna get from anybody.

337
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,321
<i>What was that?</i>

338
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:12,155
Sounded like the garage.
Damn kids are after my car!

339
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,161
Wait here!

340
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:19,667
All right! Fifteen percent down,
7.5 percent fýnancing...

341
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,032
with a ballooning mortgage
to 12.9 percent!

342
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:25,004
That's the best you're gonna get
from anybody! Think about it!

343
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,007
Don't sign with anybody
until I get back!

344
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,043
Cuh-ching, baby!

345
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:03,536
Oh, yes.

346
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:23,923
No!

347
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,228
Billy!

348
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,740
You little shit!

349
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:50,018
<i>Billy?</i>

350
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:52,753
You little creep!

351
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,762
Your ass is mine now.

352
00:32:39,173 --> 00:32:41,505
Huh.

353
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,521
Yes, I'm alone
at the Red Rock Estates.

354
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:30,682
Just send a car or a truck.

355
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,556
No, I don't know the address.
It's the big one!

356
00:33:33,628 --> 00:33:39,123
Listen, you little idiot, just send a car
or something. Jesus Christ, you are 911.

357
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:12,899
Oh, God, no!

358
00:34:23,077 --> 00:34:27,173
Oh! Oh, no! No!

359
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:30,081
No!

360
00:34:31,185 --> 00:34:34,348
No! No! No!

361
00:35:13,461 --> 00:35:15,452
Hello?

362
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,465
Anybody here?

363
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,960
Kenny?

364
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:28,469
Kenny?

365
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,147
Cool.

366
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,988
Kenny?

367
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,992
Hello?

368
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,883
Why would Biogene
want a giant snake?

369
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,956
Calling it a snake
misses the point.

370
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:28,866
As I said, it was unique.

371
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:32,702
Just the study of how it projects
its corrosive digestive fluids...

372
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:36,140
could prove invaluable
for military applications.

373
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,410
This thing pukes acid?

374
00:36:40,481 --> 00:36:43,882
You could put it that way,
yes.

375
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,250
What it actually does is
to draw up its stomach acid...

376
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:50,222
into sacs located here.

377
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:54,022
Once there, it contracts
those sacs with powerful muscles,

378
00:36:54,095 --> 00:36:58,896
which allow it to shoot this highly
caustic acid with incredible force,

379
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,833
much like a cobra
spits its venom...

380
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:05,236
<i>to subdue its prey.</i>

381
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,400
<i>Look at these. The
cockpit hatch was torn open...</i>

382
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,740
<i>wide enough to birth
a whale through.</i>

383
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,745
<i>Yes, its size
and strength were impressive,</i>

384
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:16,544
but now your people
have managed to kill it.

385
00:37:16,617 --> 00:37:18,812
Maybe not.

386
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:23,285
Looks like your pet might
have some life left in him.

387
00:37:23,357 --> 00:37:27,418
- What?
- There were no remains found in the wreckage,

388
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,759
human or otherwise.

389
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:42,768
It would only have eaten those
men if they were still alive.

390
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,450
<i>Are you saying
this thing ate the crew...</i>

391
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,611
and survived
the plane crash?

392
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,121
Yes, it's possible.

393
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,282
But if it's still alive,

394
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,623
<i>- then we have a chance to capture it and perhaps...
- Kill it.</i>

395
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:04,290
Agent Parker...

396
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,391
this specimen
is a biological gold mine.

397
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:10,460
The D.N.A. Alone
is worth millions.

398
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,666
You can scrape your D.N.A.
Off whatever's left.

399
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:16,005
<i>We've already lost
an entire flight crew,</i>

400
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:18,011
and by now we may even
have collateral losses.

401
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,138
"Collateral losses"?

402
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:23,809
That's a rather antiseptic way of
describing death, don't you think?

403
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:30,820
Keep it small. I want this solved
before anyone knows there was a problem.

404
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,325
I'm on it.

405
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,156
You have no idea
what you're up against.

406
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,757
You don't know my men.

407
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:46,671
This is not some
garden snake you're going after.

408
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:51,508
We are talking about
a perfect killing machine:

409
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:56,175
A 129-foot
all-terrain vehicle...

410
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,413
capable of speeds
exceeding 50 miles an hour...

411
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:02,012
with skin that can deflect
an antitank round,

412
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,023
enhanced night vision...

413
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,651
and a voracious appetite
for human flesh.

414
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:13,192
It will slaughter your men
before they have a chance to blink.

415
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:22,875
I don't know what it was;
some kind of big animal.

416
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:27,880
- It had a tail or something... and scales.
- "Scales"?

417
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,917
I couldn't get a good look.
It moved so quick.

418
00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:33,476
- What about the bones?
- "Bones"?

419
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:35,818
<i>- The ones in the garage.
- Yeah, Cooper.</i>

420
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:39,883
- You give old Kenny a little acid bath?
- I don't know about bones.

421
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,724
Stripped him clean, hacked that
woman's head off with a butcher knife?

422
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,561
- Ease up, Lou.
- Ease up, my ass!

423
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:49,899
Greg found him red-handed
with the murder weapon.

424
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,404
That wasn't a murder weapon. Knife
ain't got a drop of blood on it.

425
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,407
He could have
wiped it clean.

426
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:57,410
It had to be a big blade,
a machete.

427
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,742
Took her head off
in one, clean shot.

428
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:04,074
What about the blood?

429
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:07,086
- If Cooper did it, he'd be soaked in it.
- Come on.

430
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:10,248
You're buying that crap
about a big snake?

431
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,088
Hell no!
Besides, we haven't found Roberta.

432
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,754
For my money,
she's still a suspect.

433
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,424
Lou does have
a point there, Griff.

434
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,933
I mean, the bones...

435
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,435
The only thing that can
wash them that clean is acid,

436
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:27,270
and the only place in this town with
that kind of acid is their shop.

437
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,777
Cooper.

438
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,211
Yeah.

439
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,341
You don't have any plans to leave
town this weekend, do you?

440
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,623
Been dying
to use this stuff.

441
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,794
I bet we could do that.

442
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,457
- Maybe it just looks easy.
- Good point.

443
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,296
I wish I had
somewhere else to look,

444
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:57,462
but right now I got
only one fact to work with.

445
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,938
There's not a whole lot
of places in this town...

446
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:02,134
where a body can be stripped
to its bones.

447
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,803
- I can't afford to be shut down.
- I can appreciate that,

448
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,109
but I don't see any other way
to handle this.

449
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:09,115
My brother's not a murderer.

450
00:41:09,183 --> 00:41:11,117
What's going on?

451
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:13,653
We're shutting you down, Cooper.

452
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,815
- Greg...
- Take it up with the sheriff, John.

453
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:23,155
- Griff, give us a break.
- I have only one break to offer, and it ain't much.

454
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:27,496
Maybe, just maybe, you won't
have to empty the tanks.

455
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,501
- Brian, I'm...
- Sorry?

456
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:36,339
Congratulations, John. You've
managed to do what no one else could:

457
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,503
Close the doors forever
on Perfecto Plating.

458
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,015
- This isn't my fault.
- Whose fault is it? Mine?

459
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,016
Fine.

460
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:47,349
- I quit.
- Hey, don't bother! You're fýred!

461
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:04,363
Oh, no, my bike!

462
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,535
Oh, this is great.
This is fucking great!

463
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,703
Is there anything else
you can do to ruin my life?

464
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,804
<i>- Don't push it, John.
- Don't tell me not to push it.</i>

465
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:17,146
You take away my job.
You ruin my bike.

466
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:19,311
<i>You steal my girl when I'm gone
for two seconds on a tour.</i>

467
00:42:19,386 --> 00:42:22,878
- You're ruining my life!
- Your life?

468
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,925
I'm ruining your life?
Fuck you!

469
00:42:24,992 --> 00:42:28,758
I was set to be married. I was
gonna have a house and a family.

470
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:30,729
My life was all planned
until you came back.

471
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,596
She never loved you.
You were just a shoulder to cry on.

472
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:37,626
Is that right? Maybe she did love me before
you started banging her behind my back.

473
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,999
Take it off, Deputy.
Without the badge and the gun,

474
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:45,170
<i>it's just you and me.</i>

475
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:49,080
- This isn't the schoolyard.
- I heard that.

476
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,146
<i>- You're dead.
- Yeah, so are you.</i>

477
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:36,286
- I didn't steal Kristin.
- No, you just banged her.

478
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,410
- You fýght like a girl.
- You're a sissy.

479
00:43:52,479 --> 00:43:55,471
- Coward.
- Dickwad.

480
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,642
Dickwad.

481
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,152
You okay,
Deputy Greg?

482
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,656
Everything's fýne. Go back
and play, kids. Everything's fýne.

483
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,783
Go on.

484
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:09,852
You're a pain in the ass.

485
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,506
Forget about it, man.
It's totalled.

486
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,838
I'll buy you a new one.

487
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,844
You don't get it.

488
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:28,006
You can't buy me
another one of these.

489
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,074
Why not? It's just a bike.
How much can it cost?

490
00:44:31,151 --> 00:44:34,177
2,400 bucks.

491
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,188
But that's
not the point.

492
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,656
This bike got me
out of this dust hole.

493
00:44:38,726 --> 00:44:40,853
It's irreplaceable.

494
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:44,159
- I'm sorry, man. I had no idea.
- Yeah.

495
00:44:44,231 --> 00:44:47,394
This sponsor gave me
this prototype, right?

496
00:44:47,468 --> 00:44:52,371
State-of-the-art stuff: Shimano
brakes, grip shifts, RockShox.

497
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,169
You know what I did with it?

498
00:44:55,242 --> 00:44:58,541
- I gave it to Tommy.
- You gave it to Tommy?

499
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,876
Yep, I gave that bike
to Tommy...

500
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:03,746
because this is the bike
that mattered to me the most.

501
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:06,809
<i>This is the bike that gave me
what I thought I wanted.</i>

502
00:45:06,887 --> 00:45:10,379
You know what I got at home,
bottom right drawer?

503
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,392
Application to Quantico.

504
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,861
- F.B. I?
- Filled it out four and a half years ago, never sent it in.

505
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:19,228
- Why not?
- Right.

506
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,234
Some hick cop thinking
he can play Eliott Ness.

507
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,736
<i>- It's dumb.
- Please.</i>

508
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,899
It can't be dumber than some hick
punk thinking he could ride pro.

509
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,273
But you did it.
You got out of here.

510
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:36,908
You're not answering your radio. Some hikers
on a bike path just found another body.

511
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,248
Sheriff Wade's already up there.
Let's roll, partner.

512
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,810
Let's roll.

513
00:45:55,469 --> 00:45:58,927
Any luck on those bones
we found in the garage?

514
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,600
I'm checking the dental records
with Hank.

515
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:05,441
I'm hoping he can get a match
with one of his patients.

516
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,140
What in the hell
could do this?

517
00:46:08,215 --> 00:46:11,776
I don't know.
It's weird, very weird.

518
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:15,117
It's the same type
of acid death we saw earlier.

519
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:19,285
Acid. Acid. Do I have
to say it again? John Cooper, acid.

520
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,352
- What's his motive?
- Yeah, and where's Roberta Keeler?

521
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:32,464
<i>- Don't need dental records on this one.
- Yeah.</i>

522
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,099
Only guy in town that's got a fancy
watch like that is Kenny Summers.

523
00:46:35,175 --> 00:46:39,805
- It's a fake.
- So was Kenny.

524
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:07,006
Hey, Greg, a little help here.

525
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,703
Floyd's phone.

526
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:15,179
Thank you.

527
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,683
Hey, why are you defending him?

528
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,151
That asshole's probably
boning your ex-bitch right now.

529
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,018
Don't ever talk about
her like that. Do you hear me?

530
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,854
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- Never talk about her like that.

531
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,520
Guys,
give it a rest.

532
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,189
Uh, that was Hank.

533
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,859
They made a positive I.D.
On the bones from the garage.

534
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,061
It was Roberta Keeler.

535
00:47:39,806 --> 00:47:42,866
Okay, Louis, you get your wish.
You guys bring in John Cooper.

536
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,002
Meet me back at the offýce.

537
00:47:45,078 --> 00:47:48,514
See, Sheriff?
I'm a thinker.

538
00:47:48,582 --> 00:47:50,516
<i>- You know what I mean?
- Have fun, Floyd.</i>

539
00:47:50,584 --> 00:47:52,552
Thanks.

540
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,385
<i>We're gonna try
the campground at Crystal Lake.</i>

541
00:47:56,456 --> 00:48:00,051
If it's full,
then we'll play it by ear.

542
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:03,893
Where's John?
We should get going.

543
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,036
<i>- What happened?
- Nothing.</i>

544
00:48:15,108 --> 00:48:17,702
Greg and I just got
in a little scuffle.

545
00:48:17,778 --> 00:48:20,406
- Greg did this to you?
- Well, Greg... We just sort of...

546
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:27,416
- Oh, man.
- How's it going, Louis?

547
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,081
I'd love to tell you about my
emotional and physical well-being,

548
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,024
but I've got some unfortunate
business to attend to.

549
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:37,029
<i>Excuse me,
this might get ugly.</i>

550
00:48:37,097 --> 00:48:39,759
<i>John Cooper,
you are under arrest.</i>

551
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:44,600
Now extend your hands.
I will frisk you downtown.

552
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:48,232
- Extend your hands!
- You gotta be kidding me.

553
00:48:48,308 --> 00:48:50,276
No, I'm not kidding.

554
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:54,610
We found Bobbie Keeler, Mr. Murderer,
Mr. Killer, Mr. Acid-Dipper of the Skin.

555
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:57,946
Louis, what the hell
are you doing?

556
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,952
I am apprehending
the suspect, Deputy.

557
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,284
- Give me the gun.
- Pardon me?

558
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,790
Hand it over.

559
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:09,295
Now, walk to your car. Open the back
door and put the suspect in the backseat.

560
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,797
What about the handcuffs?

561
00:49:15,335 --> 00:49:17,394
Everybody okay?

562
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:21,100
- You all right?
- You bastard.

563
00:49:21,174 --> 00:49:24,473
- How could you do that to him?
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

564
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:27,138
I'd love to hear
what you have to say.

565
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:33,478
- Kristin...
- You probably hate him. You probably hate me too.

566
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,647
That does not give you the right to abuse
your authority and have him arrested.

567
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:40,454
<i>- Kristin, I just wanted...
- I'm the one that left you. Don't take it out on him.</i>

568
00:49:40,527 --> 00:49:43,826
- Okay, that's fýne.
- Am I supposed to move away from Ruby?

569
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:46,422
- You want to drive me from my hometown?
- Are you done?

570
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,661
No. You guys used
to be friends.

571
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:51,533
<i>Why don't you just have it out
with each other and settle it?</i>

572
00:49:51,605 --> 00:49:54,836
<i>- We did.
- Because I'm not gonna... What?</i>

573
00:49:54,908 --> 00:50:00,073
I don't think John did it,
and I'm gonna prove it.

574
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:07,520
Let me see if
I got this straight. You boys...

575
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:10,681
- What department did you say you were from?
- N.S.A.

576
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:15,194
- Okay. So you got this, uh...
- An operative.

577
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,629
Yeah, an operative;
this real Rambo type.

578
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:23,136
- This guy makes Rambo look
like Richard Simmons. - Uh-huh.

579
00:50:23,203 --> 00:50:25,501
You've had this man locked up
in a cage since 1974?

580
00:50:25,572 --> 00:50:27,836
In a metal box.

581
00:50:27,908 --> 00:50:30,206
In a metal box
in a military psychiatric unit.

582
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:35,044
Somehow he escaped, and he's
the one that done all these murders?

583
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:39,518
That's about the size of it.
Any questions?

584
00:50:39,586 --> 00:50:42,054
Just one.

585
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:46,456
<i>Do you expect me to believe
this load of horseshit?</i>

586
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:52,189
Let me put it this way, Sheriff.

587
00:50:52,265 --> 00:50:56,565
It would be highly expedient if
you would believe this "horseshit."

588
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:17,416
- These cuffs are too tight.
- Oh, yeah? You're gonna have to get use to it.

589
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:35,341
- Better?
- Yeah.

590
00:51:35,408 --> 00:51:37,603
<i>Thanks.</i>

591
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:41,408
Deputy.

592
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,111
What are you doing?
You know how this works.

593
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,281
- Good cop, bad cop.
- Oh, right.

594
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:55,624
Why don't you be
the bad cop for a change?

595
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:59,654
For real?
You don't mind?

596
00:51:59,733 --> 00:52:04,033
This isn't some pothead.
This is a real, live murder suspect.

597
00:52:04,104 --> 00:52:09,974
No, I've... had my fýII
of being bad cop.

598
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:14,814
Doesn't Wade keep a gun
in the drawer in there?

599
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:17,315
- The suspect.
- Mm-hmm.

600
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:27,493
Didn't think to check
in the desk, did you?

601
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:31,998
<i>- No.
- That's right, play innocent.</i>

602
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,431
Put this in evidence, Deputy.

603
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:37,026
- It's not my gun. I didn't even touch it.
- He's right, Lou.

604
00:52:37,103 --> 00:52:42,837
Technicalities.
Always the technicalities!

605
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:46,709
Killers screaming for their rights.
What about the victim's rights?

606
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:50,614
What about the victims?

607
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:58,853
- Want to call a lawyer?
- Yeah, that's the ticket.

608
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:04,022
Hide behind some cap-toothed
F. Lee Cochran type sharpie.

609
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,861
That's not gonna help
your sorry ass, boy.

610
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:11,734
No, sir. Not in Ruby.
You want to know why?

611
00:53:11,805 --> 00:53:15,104
<i>Do you want to know?</i>

612
00:53:17,177 --> 00:53:20,112
<i>Because I am the law here.</i>

613
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:24,716
- Cut him loose.
- Sheriff...

614
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:28,413
You heard me,
Mr. L-Am-The-Law.

615
00:53:28,488 --> 00:53:32,788
Sorry for any
inconvenience, John.

616
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:40,891
Does this mean...

617
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:44,232
- Can I leave town now? I had plans.
- Yeah.

618
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,101
<i>Fine.
Just be on your way.</i>

619
00:53:46,172 --> 00:53:49,573
Have a good time.
Say hey to Kristin for me.

620
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:53,511
<i>Yeah, I'll do that.</i>

621
00:54:06,893 --> 00:54:09,327
What is this place?

622
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:13,196
It's an emergency water treatment
facility, fully automated.

623
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:17,293
The Army Corps of Engineers built
it underground so it'd be secure...

624
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,361
even in the event
of a nuclear war.

625
00:54:21,107 --> 00:54:24,099
It'll keep your snake out.

626
00:54:28,248 --> 00:54:30,944
Here's the crash site.
Our position is here.

627
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,884
Bodies have been found
here, here and here.

628
00:54:33,954 --> 00:54:38,050
This, we believe, is our target.

629
00:54:38,124 --> 00:54:40,285
You don't have
enough men.

630
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,993
That's not your concern.

631
00:54:44,064 --> 00:54:47,158
This team will do
what they were trained for.

632
00:54:47,233 --> 00:54:51,226
After that, I don't care if you carve
up the carcass and open up a rib joint.

633
00:54:51,304 --> 00:54:54,398
Bottom line:
This thing dies today.

634
00:54:54,474 --> 00:54:57,136
You don't seem to realize...

635
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,008
the opportunity
you are wasting here.

636
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,814
Consider the potential
for weapons research;

637
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:07,819
new neurotoxins,

638
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:12,517
antidotes for those created
by your enemies.

639
00:55:12,592 --> 00:55:15,493
Intriguing,
Mr. Parker?

640
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:19,498
I'm not as mercenary
as you may think, Doctor.

641
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,160
I am concerned
with the loss of life.

642
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:24,703
Now, I didn't know
that flight crew,

643
00:55:24,771 --> 00:55:27,831
<i>but once I signed on
to this scheme of yours,</i>

644
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,171
they became my men.

645
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:33,235
No one else dies because of this
thing. Do you understand that?

646
00:55:33,313 --> 00:55:38,341
Oh, yes, I understand.
I just hope your snake does.

647
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:47,518
The satellite passes over
only once every three hours.

648
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:52,588
The next pass is in 72 minutes. When
that occurs, I want us in position.

649
00:55:52,665 --> 00:55:55,600
<i>Once we have the confirmed location
of the target, we'll take it out.</i>

650
00:55:55,668 --> 00:55:59,968
- I want this thing nailed before dark.
- Excuse me.

651
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,033
<i>What's this here,
this red line?</i>

652
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,712
Radar echo.

653
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,218
<i>Local law enforcement
has established roadblocks...</i>

654
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,884
<i>at all major access points
on our perimeter.</i>

655
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,390
<i>Dootson will coordinate
operations from here.</i>

656
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,559
<i>I will be leading Alpha team
down this approach.</i>

657
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,433
<i>Bravo team,
you'll flank the perimeter.</i>

658
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,907
<i>Stay in contact.</i>

659
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:40,071
<i>Once we have a lock, we'll dig in and
start shelling the hell out of this thing.</i>

660
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:44,913
<i>When we have a confirmed kill,
we'll go in and mop up.</i>

661
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:37,563
<i>Stand by, everyone.</i>

662
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:41,800
Bird's in position,
downloading.

663
00:57:45,578 --> 00:57:47,773
Dootson, status.

664
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:53,547
Target appears stationary at the
original coordinates; same as before.

665
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,487
It hasn't moved
in three hours.

666
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,649
That seem right to you?

667
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,990
It has consumed
a great deal lately,

668
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:04,495
far exceeding
its normal diet.

669
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,657
It's possible that
the high caloric intake...

670
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:11,670
has induced a respite
in its metabolic activities.

671
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,832
Meaning?

672
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:18,344
It's having
a little siesta.

673
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,853
Let me know
when you have a visual.

674
00:58:41,134 --> 00:58:43,068
I've got him, sir.

675
00:58:43,136 --> 00:58:45,536
Visual confýrmation a quarter
click southwest of my position.

676
00:58:50,009 --> 00:58:52,375
Right where the bird
showed it would be.

677
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:00,882
All units, lock and prepare
to open fýre on my command.

678
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,718
It's time to put
your baby to bed.

679
00:59:09,662 --> 00:59:11,653
Bravo unit ready.

680
00:59:11,731 --> 00:59:16,065
Tactical confýrming. Both units
show in position and ready.

681
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,569
Take her out.

682
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,437
Sounds like a damn war
in there.

683
00:59:26,512 --> 00:59:30,710
- Boys will be boys.
- Sir, you want to go in?

684
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:33,644
Louis.

685
01:00:06,953 --> 01:00:08,887
Cease fýre.

686
01:00:08,955 --> 01:00:11,822
Cease fýre!
Cease fýre!

687
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:23,635
Target destroyed, sir.
No movement.

688
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,968
I repeat: No movement.

689
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,134
You're confýrmed.
All units, move in.

690
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:33,303
Break out your petri dishes, Doc.
Time to clean up.

691
01:00:36,983 --> 01:00:41,420
- All right, let's move out.
We've got work to do.

692
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:48,986
Kill confýrmed.
Target destroyed.

693
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,826
We blew the guts
out of it, sir.

694
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,849
It shed its skin.

695
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:16,420
You knew this!
You knew it was molting!

696
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:21,022
No, I didn't.
I didn't. I swear.

697
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,155
I should turn you
into snake bait.

698
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,564
<i>- What happened?
- It was a setup.</i>

699
01:01:29,635 --> 01:01:33,571
The snake shed its skin,
and the doctor knew it.

700
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:35,698
No, I didn't know.

701
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:40,712
I suspected, based on the surveillance
photos, but I couldn't be certain.

702
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:44,876
<i>But, sir, it was here.
I saw it move.</i>

703
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,386
We were decoyed.

704
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:54,426
<i>I warned you it was intelligent.</i>

705
01:01:54,494 --> 01:01:57,895
I told you this isn't
just some common snake.

706
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:02,458
<i>If it was here...
then where is it now?</i>

707
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:07,332
Fan out! Take cover!
Protect yourselves!

708
01:02:24,891 --> 01:02:27,052
<i>Wait!</i>

709
01:02:27,126 --> 01:02:30,118
<i>What?</i>

710
01:02:30,196 --> 01:02:32,460
Don't move.

711
01:02:33,699 --> 01:02:35,633
Trust me.

712
01:02:42,742 --> 01:02:46,109
Stay completely still.

713
01:03:07,834 --> 01:03:10,268
<i>Don't.</i>

714
01:03:10,336 --> 01:03:12,896
Don't.

715
01:04:03,055 --> 01:04:08,152
<i># I met my lover
at a restaurant #</i>

716
01:04:08,227 --> 01:04:13,290
<i># She took my order
with a big smile ##</i>

717
01:04:13,366 --> 01:04:16,995
- I liked the other one better. - Yeah,
it plays better in black-and-white.

718
01:04:17,069 --> 01:04:19,503
- Totally.
- Hey, where's your mom?

719
01:04:19,572 --> 01:04:22,166
<i>Mom?</i>

720
01:04:22,241 --> 01:04:26,109
<i>I cut her up into tiny pieces and stuffed
her in the freezer in the basement!</i>

721
01:04:26,178 --> 01:04:29,238
Seriously, where is she?

722
01:04:29,315 --> 01:04:31,840
She's visiting her sister
in Walla Walla for the weekend.

723
01:04:31,918 --> 01:04:34,512
Really?

724
01:04:34,587 --> 01:04:37,283
- Oh.
- Yeah.

725
01:04:37,356 --> 01:04:39,688
So we have this place
just to ourselves?

726
01:04:39,759 --> 01:04:42,353
Uh-huh.

727
01:04:42,428 --> 01:04:47,695
So it's like...
just you and me?

728
01:04:48,935 --> 01:04:52,063
- Uh-huh.
- Just us?

729
01:04:53,606 --> 01:04:55,699
So it's like...

730
01:04:55,775 --> 01:04:58,710
It's just Tommy
and Theresa tonight?

731
01:04:58,778 --> 01:05:00,871
Uh-huh.

732
01:05:02,715 --> 01:05:04,979
Jesus!

733
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:08,987
- What got into Caesar?
- God.

734
01:05:15,294 --> 01:05:17,660
You know where the couch is.
Make yourself comfy.

735
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:19,823
The shower upstairs is broken,
so use the one downstairs.

736
01:05:19,899 --> 01:05:22,834
But I'll be there in the morning, so
don't think about checking out the goods.

737
01:05:22,902 --> 01:05:26,167
- But...
- I told John and Kristin we'd pick them up at 6:00 a. M.

738
01:05:26,238 --> 01:05:30,641
So I'd get some rest because 5:00
a. M. Comes around really early.

739
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:33,008
Don't let
the bed bugs bite.

740
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:39,017
"Bed bugs"?

741
01:05:39,085 --> 01:05:41,918
Dude.

742
01:05:43,255 --> 01:05:46,486
Come on, Greg, I'm tired.
I want to go home.

743
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:49,585
What happened to all that
"Let's get the bad guys"?

744
01:05:49,662 --> 01:05:53,996
Okay, okay,
so I've learned my lesson.

745
01:05:54,066 --> 01:05:56,364
Which is?

746
01:05:56,435 --> 01:05:58,403
<i>I've got to be patient.</i>

747
01:05:58,471 --> 01:06:01,304
I've got to let
the evidence come to me.

748
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,365
<i>That's right.</i>

749
01:06:03,442 --> 01:06:05,808
Try to get some sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.

750
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:09,640
See you in the morning.

751
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:39,507
Wake up.
Show time. Hey!

752
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:42,513
I'm up, I'm up.
Jeez.

753
01:07:38,571 --> 01:07:40,505
Tommy, is that you?

754
01:07:46,112 --> 01:07:49,843
All right.
I'm up, I'm up.

755
01:07:49,915 --> 01:07:52,179
Dude.
Jeez.

756
01:08:25,785 --> 01:08:28,379
Damn it, Tommy! Couldn't you
have at least waited a minute?

757
01:08:36,662 --> 01:08:40,325
- Theresa?
- Tommy!

758
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,062
Theresa!

759
01:08:44,136 --> 01:08:46,604
<i>- Theresa!
- Tommy!</i>

760
01:08:46,672 --> 01:08:51,200
<i>- Tommy!
- Theresa, open the door!</i>

761
01:09:00,686 --> 01:09:03,712
<i>- Open up the door, Theresa!
- Tommy!</i>

762
01:09:03,789 --> 01:09:07,122
Tommy!

763
01:09:25,477 --> 01:09:29,538
<i>Tommy! No, no.</i>

764
01:09:31,217 --> 01:09:33,777
<i>- Tommy!
- Open up!</i>

765
01:09:39,124 --> 01:09:41,149
The door's stuck, honey!

766
01:09:43,796 --> 01:09:46,663
- Tommy, get away from that thing!
- What? What?

767
01:09:46,732 --> 01:09:49,292
Get away
from the door. There's a snake.

768
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:54,061
Tommy, get away
from the door!

769
01:09:54,139 --> 01:09:57,905
Dude, you got me
out of bed for a snake?

770
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,004
Tommy!

771
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:04,675
No!

772
01:10:12,524 --> 01:10:14,788
Tommy!

773
01:10:19,031 --> 01:10:22,626
Come on, come on! Move!

774
01:10:39,118 --> 01:10:41,052
No answer.

775
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,554
Maybe we should
go over there.

776
01:11:01,941 --> 01:11:06,878
<i>Oh, God. Come on. Move, move!</i>

777
01:12:32,631 --> 01:12:35,862
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

778
01:12:37,636 --> 01:12:40,799
That's Tommy's.

779
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:00,324
Wait here.

780
01:13:12,838 --> 01:13:14,829
They're not in here.

781
01:13:16,341 --> 01:13:21,106
Theresa!

782
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:23,580
Tommy!

783
01:13:27,019 --> 01:13:30,716
<i>Theresa!</i>

784
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:34,950
<i>Theresa!</i>

785
01:13:35,027 --> 01:13:39,327
Theresa? Tommy?

786
01:13:46,105 --> 01:13:50,474
Theresa! Tommy!

787
01:13:50,542 --> 01:13:53,306
John! Kristin!

788
01:13:53,378 --> 01:13:56,472
John! Kristin!

789
01:14:01,153 --> 01:14:03,644
- John!
- Kristin!

790
01:14:03,722 --> 01:14:08,250
No! No!

791
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,992
<i>John! John!</i>

792
01:14:32,751 --> 01:14:34,844
Go! Go!

793
01:14:37,022 --> 01:14:39,013
Quick!

794
01:14:53,972 --> 01:14:55,963
Hey, Griff, any word yet?

795
01:14:59,144 --> 01:15:02,375
Not a peep.

796
01:15:02,447 --> 01:15:05,473
<i>- You heard any more fireworks?
- Negative.</i>

797
01:15:05,551 --> 01:15:08,179
Maybe you should
check on them.

798
01:15:09,888 --> 01:15:13,756
Yeah, maybe I should.

799
01:15:13,825 --> 01:15:16,988
I'll wake Louis up.

800
01:15:17,062 --> 01:15:21,829
Wake up, sleepyhead.
Time to catch bad guys.

801
01:15:24,236 --> 01:15:26,295
Louis?

802
01:15:27,906 --> 01:15:29,840
Louis?

803
01:15:29,908 --> 01:15:32,536
If you're not up when I get
over there, I'm gonna kick your ass.

804
01:15:33,745 --> 01:15:37,476
- Hey, what is that?
- I don't know.

805
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:43,053
<i>Come on.</i>

806
01:15:52,598 --> 01:15:55,192
Hey, slow down.

807
01:15:55,267 --> 01:15:57,394
Forget that.

808
01:16:02,541 --> 01:16:04,634
It looks clear.

809
01:16:09,881 --> 01:16:13,317
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

810
01:16:13,385 --> 01:16:15,819
<i>- No!
- You hear that?</i>

811
01:16:15,887 --> 01:16:20,153
<i>- Oh, yeah.
- No!</i>

812
01:16:20,225 --> 01:16:23,820
<i>Stupid.
So blind.</i>

813
01:16:23,895 --> 01:16:28,332
<i>Stupid.
Wrong. Blind.</i>

814
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,494
<i>Who the hell is he?</i>

815
01:16:33,572 --> 01:16:35,506
Hello?

816
01:16:38,243 --> 01:16:40,677
Sir?

817
01:16:40,746 --> 01:16:46,651
Already I had fýxed
my gaze upon him...

818
01:16:46,718 --> 01:16:52,020
and he rose upright
with breast in countenance,

819
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:55,856
as if he entertained
some great scorn of hell.

820
01:16:55,927 --> 01:17:00,762
- Python.
- He's in shock.

821
01:17:00,832 --> 01:17:05,292
So blind.
So wrong.

822
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:10,808
Not until
I stared in its eyes...

823
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:14,403
and saw the terror around me...

824
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:16,811
Not until then...

825
01:17:16,882 --> 01:17:19,783
did I realize what I'd done.

826
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:54,010
Maybe it evolved naturally.

827
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:57,852
Maybe it's been out there all along
and we just never knew it.

828
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:00,858
Perhaps it's some kind
of mutation.

829
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:05,625
We certainly dumped enough Agent
Orange on Southeast Asia during the war.

830
01:18:05,697 --> 01:18:10,134
But if it has all these features from all
different kinds of snakes like you say,

831
01:18:10,202 --> 01:18:12,295
it couldn't have
evolved naturally.

832
01:18:12,371 --> 01:18:16,967
Yeah, but maybe it didn't. Maybe it was
created in some secret government operation.

833
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:19,306
What? I've seen it
a hundred times in the movies.

834
01:18:19,378 --> 01:18:22,472
They're always
doing stuff like that, right?

835
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:24,481
Actually, he's correct.

836
01:18:24,549 --> 01:18:28,144
We considered the possibility
ourselves. We just never knew.

837
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:31,986
That's why we were so eager to get
it back to the lab to examine it.

838
01:18:34,726 --> 01:18:37,160
- Did we forget to lock the door?
- Lock it?

839
01:18:37,229 --> 01:18:39,993
- We didn't even close it.
- Shit!

840
01:18:49,508 --> 01:18:52,238
Theresa!

841
01:18:54,913 --> 01:18:57,143
What's with the towel?

842
01:18:57,215 --> 01:19:00,275
It got Tommy.

843
01:19:26,611 --> 01:19:29,478
What the hell
are you doing?

844
01:19:43,061 --> 01:19:45,325
Louis?

845
01:19:51,403 --> 01:19:53,894
Look at all this stuff.

846
01:19:53,972 --> 01:19:57,999
Are you telling me you couldn't
take it out with all this?

847
01:19:58,076 --> 01:20:01,102
<i>They never had a chance.</i>

848
01:20:01,179 --> 01:20:04,239
They emptied their entire
arsenal at a shed skin.

849
01:20:06,852 --> 01:20:11,346
There's no way the snake
could take this much heat.

850
01:20:11,423 --> 01:20:13,618
If you could hit it.

851
01:20:15,694 --> 01:20:18,128
What if we lured it
down here?

852
01:20:18,196 --> 01:20:20,289
Are you out of your mind?

853
01:20:20,365 --> 01:20:22,458
Let's just wait it out.

854
01:20:22,534 --> 01:20:26,800
<i>- Sooner or later, it's bound to get hungry and move on.
- You must understand,</i>

855
01:20:26,872 --> 01:20:29,807
it's still basically a snake.

856
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:34,778
Even at its size, it could go a month
without feeding right outside that door.

857
01:20:34,846 --> 01:20:37,974
There's not enough food
in here for us to wait that long.

858
01:20:38,049 --> 01:20:42,816
And if it did decide to leave,
where do you think it would go?

859
01:20:42,888 --> 01:20:44,856
Ruby.

860
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:48,654
Oh, my God. The whole town is
like an all-you-can-eat special.

861
01:20:48,727 --> 01:20:51,491
I don't want to wait around
to see what's gonna happen.

862
01:20:51,563 --> 01:20:54,657
So what do you say?
How about it?

863
01:20:54,733 --> 01:20:57,497
I say we kill
the motherfucker.

864
01:20:57,569 --> 01:21:00,003
Sheriff Wade.

865
01:21:02,007 --> 01:21:05,101
Come on, Griff.
Come on, Griff.

866
01:21:06,344 --> 01:21:09,142
<i>Greg, can you hear me?</i>

867
01:21:09,214 --> 01:21:13,116
<i>- Kristin, is that you?
- Greg?</i>

868
01:21:13,184 --> 01:21:17,450
<i>- Kristin, what are you doing on this channel?
- Greg, we need your help.</i>

869
01:21:17,522 --> 01:21:19,456
<i>Listen.</i>

870
01:21:23,862 --> 01:21:26,296
Wish me luck, baby.

871
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,304
Here.

872
01:21:46,384 --> 01:21:48,352
Set.

873
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:51,321
Set.

874
01:21:52,724 --> 01:21:55,318
Armed.

875
01:21:55,393 --> 01:21:57,486
Okay, let's go,
let's go.

876
01:23:32,691 --> 01:23:35,819
I'm coming through!
Get ready!

877
01:23:40,799 --> 01:23:44,291
- Well, that's not
gonna hold for long.

878
01:23:44,369 --> 01:23:46,496
<i>- No, it won't, so come on.
Get going, get going!</i>

879
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:48,505
<i>- Go, go, go.
- Get Kristin!</i>

880
01:23:48,573 --> 01:23:50,507
<i>- Right on!
- All right!</i>

881
01:24:12,564 --> 01:24:14,498
Go.

882
01:24:57,542 --> 01:24:59,476
<i>Greg!</i>

883
01:25:04,716 --> 01:25:07,651
I gotta tie this to the bumper!

884
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:11,821
Greg, where's the bumper?
There's no bumper?

885
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:14,654
Right under there.

886
01:25:26,671 --> 01:25:29,071
- Now.
- I'm trying.

887
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:31,700
<i>Now!</i>

888
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:34,301
<i>I think it's there.</i>

889
01:25:35,613 --> 01:25:37,171
<i>Now, guys.</i>

890
01:25:37,248 --> 01:25:39,739
Go, Greg! Go! Go!

891
01:25:39,818 --> 01:25:42,013
<i>Come on! Now's the time!</i>

892
01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:54,021
<i>John!</i>

893
01:25:57,101 --> 01:26:02,733
<i>John, are you okay?</i>

894
01:26:13,718 --> 01:26:15,652
Nice job, John.

895
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:19,019
Let's go, let's go!
Move it!

896
01:26:42,914 --> 01:26:45,348
Miss, I think
you've earned this.

897
01:26:45,416 --> 01:26:47,350
Thanks.

898
01:26:47,418 --> 01:26:51,184
This is for you, Tommy.

899
01:27:03,534 --> 01:27:06,992
Somehow, I thought
it would be bigger.

900
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:09,005
What happened?

901
01:27:09,073 --> 01:27:12,133
The python must have
torn out the antenna leads...

902
01:27:12,210 --> 01:27:14,201
when he crashed
through the bunker.

903
01:27:14,279 --> 01:27:16,645
So what do we do?

904
01:27:16,714 --> 01:27:20,150
We have to reset the detonator.

905
01:27:22,053 --> 01:27:27,047
Here. Would you
please take her?

906
01:27:27,125 --> 01:27:30,117
Take good care
of her for me.

907
01:27:30,194 --> 01:27:32,185
She's all I've got.

908
01:27:32,263 --> 01:27:34,458
What are you talking about?

909
01:27:37,068 --> 01:27:39,764
Redemption.

910
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:44,238
Where's he going?

911
01:27:46,144 --> 01:27:48,669
Doc, don't go in there!

912
01:27:48,746 --> 01:27:51,579
John!

913
01:27:54,452 --> 01:27:56,511
Um, o-okay.
Could... Sit tight.

914
01:27:56,587 --> 01:27:59,715
Could you take this?
You've got to be kidding me.

915
01:28:07,165 --> 01:28:10,464
<i>- John, come on.
- Shit! He's alone with that snake, Kristin.</i>

916
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:13,003
- Come on! It's gonna blow!
- John!

917
01:28:54,645 --> 01:28:57,205
<i>- Take the snake! Take the snake!
- Come on!</i>

918
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:35,314
Good work.

919
01:29:37,655 --> 01:29:40,488
- Get in the car! What kind of
Wheaties does this thing eat?

920
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:54,667
All right, plan B. This thing survived
a plane crash and major explosives.

921
01:29:54,739 --> 01:29:56,673
It won't burn.
Can't shoot it.

922
01:29:56,741 --> 01:29:58,834
Any suggestions?

923
01:29:58,910 --> 01:30:00,844
The plating plant!

924
01:30:00,912 --> 01:30:02,937
The acid!

925
01:30:03,014 --> 01:30:05,608
Think we could dump
this thing in one of those tanks?

926
01:30:07,919 --> 01:30:10,752
Got any eights?

927
01:30:13,524 --> 01:30:17,483
- Go fýsh.
- Do you even know how to play this game?

928
01:30:17,562 --> 01:30:19,792
Go fýsh.

929
01:30:28,873 --> 01:30:30,864
- What the hell are you doing?
- No time to explain, Bri.

930
01:30:30,942 --> 01:30:33,809
- Let's just say there's this little...
- "Little"?

931
01:30:33,878 --> 01:30:36,312
Big thing after us;
actually, after the whole town.

932
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:40,316
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

933
01:30:40,384 --> 01:30:43,615
That.

934
01:30:51,129 --> 01:30:54,428
- What is that thing?
- Show them where the winch controls are!

935
01:30:54,499 --> 01:30:56,399
- What for?
- Just show me!

936
01:30:56,467 --> 01:30:58,435
Go, go, go, go!

937
01:30:58,503 --> 01:31:00,835
- I'll bring it to you.
- No, you risked your life last time. I'll do it.

938
01:31:00,905 --> 01:31:03,100
Nah, it's okay. I'm getting
the hang of this thing now.

939
01:31:03,174 --> 01:31:05,199
All's I gotta do is get
its attention fýrst.

940
01:31:05,276 --> 01:31:08,439
Like this. Got your attention?

941
01:31:10,081 --> 01:31:12,015
Go, go!

942
01:31:13,684 --> 01:31:16,778
The controls are right there.
Grab that.

943
01:31:16,854 --> 01:31:18,913
- What do we do?
- Get a wrench!

944
01:31:19,991 --> 01:31:21,652
Okay.

945
01:31:38,109 --> 01:31:40,009
<i>Hurry up, hurry up.</i>

946
01:31:43,781 --> 01:31:47,182
Come on, come on.

947
01:32:00,464 --> 01:32:02,591
It's good!

948
01:32:02,667 --> 01:32:06,068
- Hit it!
- Okay!

949
01:32:11,909 --> 01:32:13,934
Let's go!

950
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:02,620
Psst, hey.

951
01:33:02,693 --> 01:33:04,752
Where is it?

952
01:33:23,547 --> 01:33:25,606
<i>What happened?</i>

953
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,810
Like you said,
I got his attention.

954
01:34:48,132 --> 01:34:56,096
<i># I canchangetheworld
Yeah #</i>

955
01:34:56,173 --> 01:35:00,576
<i># I can change the world ##</i>

956
01:35:00,644 --> 01:35:02,942
Ha!

957
01:35:03,013 --> 01:35:05,811
Checkmate,
you sorry son of a bitch.

958
01:35:05,883 --> 01:35:08,147
You used the Spassky maneuver
at the end there.

959
01:35:08,219 --> 01:35:11,313
Next time I'll be prepared
and use the Fischer countermove.

960
01:35:11,389 --> 01:35:15,155
- Very well.
- Jeez, you guys, what's it been, six hours?

961
01:35:15,226 --> 01:35:17,490
Get a life.

962
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:29,664
Especially when being hunted
by a giant reptile with bad breath,

963
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:31,674
this is the one for you.

964
01:35:38,582 --> 01:35:40,675
From now on...

965
01:35:40,751 --> 01:35:43,686
you can call me
Special Agent Larson.

966
01:35:43,754 --> 01:35:45,688
- You got in?
- I got in.

967
01:35:45,756 --> 01:35:48,350
Great. The F.B.I.'s
gonna be proud to have you.

968
01:35:48,426 --> 01:35:52,692
Maybe helping kill a giant acid-spitting
snake pulled some strings at Quantico.

969
01:35:52,763 --> 01:35:55,857
- We're gonna miss you down here.
- I'm gonna miss you guys too.

970
01:35:55,933 --> 01:35:59,369
It's time I went out and tried to
fýgure out some of the things you did.

971
01:35:59,437 --> 01:36:02,304
- Besides, it's getting a little crowded around here.
- Tell me about it.

972
01:36:02,373 --> 01:36:06,139
We've been swamped
since opening day.

973
01:36:06,210 --> 01:36:10,476
<i>A man in your condition
should not be drinking.</i>

974
01:36:10,548 --> 01:36:12,812
Congratulations,
stud boy.

975
01:36:14,385 --> 01:36:16,444
What?

976
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,454
We're pregnant.

977
01:36:20,057 --> 01:36:23,993
I'm gonna have a baby.

978
01:36:25,229 --> 01:36:28,665
