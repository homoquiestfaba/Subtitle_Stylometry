- I know, totally.

42
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:47,333
- (laughs) Oh no,

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,335
look who's heading this way.

44
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:50,203
- [Girls] Vera.

45
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,137
- Hey guys.

46
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,139
- I think there's something 
wrong with my ears.

47
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,576
I could swear that nerdy Vera 
was trying to talk to us.

48
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:00,213
- Her breath always 
smells like bacon bits.

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,114
(laughing)

50
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:01,781
(gasping)

51
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,116
- I was just going to ask you 
guys

52
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,851
what you're listening to.

53
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,020
- We're listening to Lance 
Canyon,

54
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:08,254
he's the coolest singer out now.

55
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,255
- No, he's not.

56
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,924
Sexina is the coolest singer out 
there.

57
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,126
- How would you know what's 
cool?

58
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,294
- Yeah, you suck.

59
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,695
Beat it porkchop!

60
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,830

61
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:21,034
(dramatic music)

62
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,969
- Stop laughing at me!

63
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,877
- Sexina, I'm glad you're here.

64
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,711
I need to talk to you.

65
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,646
- If it's about the incident 
in the limo, I can explain.

66
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,381
- We have bigger problems than 
that.

67
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,049
- What?

68
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,450
- I just watched an advance copy

69
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,587
of the new Lance Canyon 
video, and it is hot.

70
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,688
- How hot?

71
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:42,956
- Piping hot.

72
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:43,623
- That hot?

73
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,025
- Hotter than my sweaty balls.

74
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,994
- I want to see it.

75
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:53,800
(wood thudding)

76
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,404
- Lance Canyon, you are 
accused of the crime

77
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,808
of being totally awesome.

78
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,010
How do you plead?

79
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,044
- Guilty.

80
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:06,479
- In that case,

81
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,183
I'm giving you a life sentence 
to party!

82
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,818
(upbeat music)

83
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:12,752
Yeah!

84
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,892
Lance, you're sexy for life!

85
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,164
- Don't you want to see the rest 
of it?

86
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,065
- I think I've seen enough.

87
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,301
- Sexina, I don't think 
you realize the impact

88
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,602
this video's gonna have.

89
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:30,770
Every teenager in the country

90
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,372
is going to want to buy his 
album.

91
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,172
If you're not careful,

92
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,674
you could become yesterday's 
news.

93
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,542
- You said the same thing two 
years ago

94
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,044
about Sir-Stabs-A-Lot,

95
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,280
and his last album hardly made 
the top 20.

96
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,447
Don't worry.

97
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,283
Lance Canyon, he'll come and go.

98
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,652
- Yeah, but I have a feeling 
that when Lance comes,

99
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,220
he'll come with the thunder.

100
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,390
(thunder roaring)

101
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,995
- Yes, I am so close

102
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,465
to perfecting my ultimate 
creation.

103
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,001
I must make sure that this time

104
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,604
it doesn't fall into the wrong 
hands.

105
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:06,839
Who are you?

106
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,174
This is private property.

107
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,542
- Don't act stupid, professor!

108
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,411
How long did you think 
you can hide from us?

109
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,312
- I see.

110
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,015
I'll tell you the same 
thing I told your boss.

111
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:17,417
I quit.

112
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:18,651
- You can't quit!

113
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,420
The boss needs you.

114
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,921
And I'm here to take you with 
me.

115
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:22,655
- Never.

116
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,491
Now, leave so that I can finish 
my work.

117
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:28,928
(dramatic music)

118
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,565
- So, this must be your 
daughter.

119
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,366
- Put that down!

120
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,901
- She looks barely legal.

121
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,370
She could have a long life.

122
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,440
Of course, that's if you 
cooperate.

123
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,742
- Oh, dear.

124
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,650
- [Girls] Hi Vera!

125
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:51,951
- Hello.

126
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,419
- Don't be scared, Vera.

127
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,320
We just wanted to know if you 
wanted

128
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,955
to have some breakfast with us.

129
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:56,789
- Really?

130
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,525
- We feel really bad about 
yesterday.

131
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,260
- And we want to make it up to 
you.

132
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,328
- Okay.

133
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,430
I would love to have 
breakfast with you guys.

134
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,998
- I hope you like eggs!

135
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,134
(laughing)

136
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,803
(shrieking)

137
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,405
(crying)

138
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,474
(sad music)

139
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,075
- Why, oh, why?

140
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,112
(laughing)

141
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,781
- That was such a great idea, 
Crystal.

142
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,283
- That was so funny!

143
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:24,951
- Oh, what can I say?

144
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,720
I'm beautiful and smart. 
(laughs)

145
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,056
- [Girls] You so are!

146
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,493
- So Sal, how's it going with 
the contest

147
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,026
I asked you to set up?

148
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,795
- Oh yeah, remind me about that 
again.

149
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,930
- The one where I perform 
for free at a high school.

150
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,699
- Why would you want to do that?

151
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,134
- Come on.

152
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,535
Can you do it or not?

153
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:43,936
- Relax, the posters should be

154
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,205
at all the high schools 
around the country today.

155
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,206
- Oh.

156
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,543
(phone ringing)

157
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,310
- Hello?

158
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,146
- Sexina, it's Sara, 
I need to talk to you.

159
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,046
- Okay, one sec.

160
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,382
- Hey, Sal, do you mind 
giving me a second alone?

161
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,049
- Sure.

162
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:58,351
- Thanks.

163
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,154
(tense music)

164
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:02,789
- Okay Sara, what's up?

165
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,125
- Have you ever heard of 
a Professor Van Bunson?

166
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,727
- Yeah, he was the lead singer

167
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:09,128
in the Van Bunson trio in the 
'60s,

168
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,130
and then he just gave up 
music to pursue science.

169
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,033
Actually, I think he's the 
world's leading scientist

170
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,368
in robotics now.

171
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,102
- That's him.

172
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:18,638
His daughter just called me.

173
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:20,139
He's missing.

174
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,008
She wants us to track him down.

175
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,342
- Alright, I'm on it.

176
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,944
You get as much information you 
can

177
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,112
from Van Bunson's daughter,

178
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,980
and I'll talk to my informants, 
okay?

179
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:28,648
I'll be in touch.

180
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,818
- By the way, what are 
you wearing right now?

181
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,519
- Why do you want to know that?

182
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,154
- Just curious.

183
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,088
- Okay.

184
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:51,070
(cheerful, dramatic music)

185
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,814
- Hope you're ready for the 
big game against Madison.

186
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,983
- I'm going to give 120% coach.

187
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,684
- Atta'boy.

188
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,885
(grunting)

189
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,887
- Coach, I got a math 
test in a few minutes.

190
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,356
I've gotta go look over my 
notes.

191
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,024
- Math, huh?

192
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:13,326
Atta'boy.

193
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,695
- Coach, I really can't talk 
right now.

194
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:18,464
- Alright, Zach, I'll see 
you at practice tomorrow.

195
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,866
- [Zach] Alright, Coach.

196
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:20,633
- Atta'boy.

197
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,669
(metal thudding)

198
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:27,039
- Hey honey.

199
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,075
Where's my kiss before third 
period?

200
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,177
- I got it right here, 
beautiful.

201
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,780
(lips smacking)

202
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,785
- God, ugh.

203
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,858
I hate that boney bitch.

204
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,995
I would love to show her up.

205
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,097
(sighs) How?

206
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,668
(dreamy music)

207
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:01,974
It says here that the person 
who writes the best essay

208
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,911
and gets the most signatures 
from other students

209
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:08,848
will get to see Sexina 
perform live at their school.

210
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,685
And get to spend an entire day 
with her!

211
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,355
(sighs) This is it!

212
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:21,093
If I get Sexina to sing 
here everyone will like me.

213
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,431
(zipping)

214
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,734
(tense, jazzy music)

215
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,343
(lighter clicking)

216
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:37,977
- What's up, Jay?

217
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:38,978
- Oh, man.

218
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,647
Every time you come around 
you need something from me.

219
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,316
- What are you complaining 
about?

220
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,050
You know I pay you.

221
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,151
- You want a hit off this?

222
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,452
- No, you know I don't smoke.

223
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,754
- That's a damn shame 
'cause this some good shit.

224
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,657
This stuff could knock 
Tommy Chong out for a week.

225
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:52,925
- Come on, enough small talk.

226
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:53,759
Let's get down to business,

227
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:54,794
I need some information.

228
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,329
- You're all business, alright.

229
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:57,530
Let's get to it.

230
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,966
- I'm looking for a missing 
scientist.

231
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,734
Professor Van Bunson, have 
you ever heard of him?

232
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,336
- No, what's he look like?

233
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,304
- Here, here's a picture.

234
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,675
- Yeah, I have seen this dude 
before.

235
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,744
My memory's not so great on 
account

236
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,546
of I'm such a pothead and all, 
but...

237
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,481
Oh yeah, it was over at Glitz 
Records.

238
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,351
I was over there selling some 
he rb to Lance Canyon, and, uh.

239
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,753
- Wait, was the professor 
doing at Glitz Records?

240
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:21,420
- He was working.

241
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,389
He's got his own office and 
everything.

242
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,290
That's all I know.

243
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,791
- Alright.

244
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:26,892
Thanks for the info.

245
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:27,927
- Stay gold.

246
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,195
- See you later, Jay.

247
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,666
(tense music)

248
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,801
(grunting)

249
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,571
- [Boss] Oh, be gentle, 
don't damage the goods.

250
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:44,276
Good, we have you back 
in our grasp once again.

251
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,180
Back where you belong, at Glitz 
Records.

252
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,082
- Please, listen to reason.

253
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,351
What you've been doing is wrong.

254
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,386
- [Boss] I don't care about 
that,

255
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,022
all I care about is money and 
boy bands.

256
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,825
Try to not to think about 
it morally, numb nuts.

257
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,093
Just do what I tell you.

258
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,863
You know who will be 
punished if you don't.

259
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,166
- I'm only doing this 
to protect my daughter.

260
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,034
- [Boss] Whatever.

261
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,269
As long as you do it.

262
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,338
- I have one more thing to say.

263
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:17,343
That Lance Canyon album is 
really hot.

264
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,913
- [Boss] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, 
Lance is pretty hot. (laughs)

265
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,816
I mean, his album's pretty hot,

266
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,551
but I'd like to see hotter.

267
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,421
It is your genius that will make 
me

268
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:32,658
the richest CEO in the music 
industry,

269
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,227
and no one can stop me.

270
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,767
- So how often do you look 
at yourself in the mirror?

271
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,837
- Oh, not often, around 40 hours 
a week.

272
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,205
- Why do you do this?

273
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,807
- I like to look at myself.

274
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,777
You know, sometimes I 
wonder what it would be like

275
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:52,745
to be in someone else's body,

276
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,816
so I know how it feels 
to have sex with me.

277
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,219
- Your song, You Need That Extra 
Deep Love

278
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,321
got you in a lot of trouble 
with the church groups

279
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,924
because the way you described 
your penis.

280
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,959
- Look, I don't understand 
why they're mad.

281
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,995
I mean, my penis was 
touched by God. (chuckles)

282
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,664
They should just worship it.

283
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,133
- Your album is really, 
really hot right now.

284
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,402
Do you think it will outsell 
Sexina's latest album?

285
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:19,472
- Look, I think it's my 
destiny to outsell that album.

286
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,007
I mean, Sexina was pretty good 
in her day,

287
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,876
but it's time to move on.

288
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,845
People are ready for the next 
big thing and, (chuckles)

289
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,546
that would be me.

290
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,082
(chuckling)

291
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,517
- Hey Lance, baby.

292
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:32,852
- Hey, What's Your Name.

293
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,791
(upbeat blues guitar music)

294
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:05,951
- Hey Stevie, how you doin'?

295
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,720
- Maude, it's great to see you.

296
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,555
- (shushing) Your voice.

297
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,856
I don't want anyone to know my 
real name.

298
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:15,161
- Oh, maybe now you're 
Sexina the famous pop star,

299
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,631
but to me you'll always be Maude 
Jenkins,

300
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:22,134
the little girl I used 
to bounce on my knee.

301
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,536
- I'm sorry I don't come 
and see you anymore Stevie,

302
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,539
just after my dad died 
I've just gotten so famous

303
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,274
I hardly have time for anything 
else.

304
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,676
- Your father would be 
proud of your success.

305
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,912
I wish he was here to see it.

306
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:33,779
- Me too.

307
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,315
You know, he's the one that 
deserves all the success I have.

308
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,351
He was one of the best blues 
guitar players in the world,

309
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,187
until the record company ripped 
him off.

310
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,189
In all those years of playing 
music

311
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,790
and he ended up penniless.

312
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,026
That's why I'm here doing what 
I'm doing.

313
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,695
Stopping corruption and 
evil in the music industry.

314
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,163
- And you're doing a great job.

315
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,632
It's good to know that 
there's someone like you

316
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,701
sticking it to those fat cats.

317
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:56,202
(chuckling)

318
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,803
I know that you're a hard chick,

319
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,005
but I worry about you.

320
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,942
I promised your dad that 
I would look after you.

321
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,245
Did he ever tell you how 
we ended up raising you?

322
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,615
- Yeah, he told me all 
about how my parents

323
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:10,950
were eaten by cannibals.

324
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,219
- (laughs) That's not the truth.

325
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,088
He told you that to make you 
feel better.

326
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,857
You want to hear the real story?

327
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:23,295
Well, one night he was 
walking home after a show.

328
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,497
(humming)

329
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,367
(baby crying)

330
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:29,902
- Was that a baby?

331
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,538
(baby crying)

332
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,009
What you doing in there baby?

333
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:37,943
(retching)

334
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,979
(spitting)

335
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,681
(baby crying)

336
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:52,324
I'm sorry, baby.

337
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,027
I promise I won't do that again.

338
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,431
I wonder what happened to your 
parents?

339
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,701
You really are beautiful.

340
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:05,070
Guess what?

341
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,240
You are coming home with 
me tonight, little mama.

342
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,910
- And from that day on he's 
raised you

343
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,044
like you're his own daughter.

344
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,545
- Why didn't he ever tell me 
that?

345
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,147
- He'd rather have you think

346
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,182
that your parents were eaten by 
cannibals

347
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,286
rather than know that they 
tossed you in the trash.

348
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,522
He told you that because he 
loved you.

349
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,726
- (sighs) Anyway, Stevie, 
I need your help, okay?

350
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,361
I'm looking for a missing 
scientist

351
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,330
whose name is Professor Van 
Bunson.

352
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,066
He used to work at Glitz 
Records.

353
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,267
Do you know anyone who works 
there?

354
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,603
- I know somebody who works at 
Glitz.

355
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,005
I'll have him call Sara,

356
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,674
and she can make an appointment.

357
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:42,841
- Thank you, Stevie!

358
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,777
Thank you for everything.

359
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,045
- It's no problem.

360
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,314
I'd do anything for Maude.

361
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,459
- What is she doing?

362
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,227
- Hey, would you sign this list

363
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,662
to get Sexina to sing at our 
school?

364
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,130
- [Girl In Blue] Yeah, 
sure, that sounds cool!

365
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,766
- What a lame attempt to 
get people to like her.

366
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,367
- [Vera] Thanks.

367
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:09,301
- [Girl In Blue] No problem.

368
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:10,703
- How pathetic.

369
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,338
- I know, really.

370
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:13,439
- Hey beautiful.

371
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,040
- Hey gorgeous.

372
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,677
- Oh, cool, that girl is trying 
to get Sexina to come here,

373
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:19,178
I'm gonna go sign up.

374
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,714
- Zach, I need you to take my 
books

375
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,982
to my remedial math class.

376
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,216
- Sure. 
- Now.

377
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,384
- Anything for you.

378
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:33,492
(dramatic music)

379
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,227
- I want you to know that we 
have

380
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,496
our best person on the case.

381
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:42,368
She is tough, smart, and very 
sexy.

382
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:47,072
She also the coolest 
walk and a great smile.

383
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:51,210
(sighs) Anyway, we are very 
dedicated

384
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,511
to finding your father.

385
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,546
- It feels so good to hear that.

386
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,415
The police haven't been much 
help.

387
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,916
- Were you aware that your 
father

388
00:16:57,983 --> 00:16:59,451
used to work for Glitz Records?

389
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,787
- I know he was working 
on a secret project,

390
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,722
but he wouldn't tell me for 
whom.

391
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,325
Isn't Lance Canyon on Glitz 
Records?

392
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,326
- Yes, he is.

393
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,795
- His album is really hot.

394
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,630
- Yes, very hot.

395
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,167
Does your father have any 
enemies that you're aware of?

396
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,102
- He's a very sweet man.

397
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,805
Weird and nerdy, but sweet.

398
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,707
I can't imagine anyone hating 
him.

399
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,409
- We think he might have been 
kidnapped

400
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,077
by someone who wants to get 
their hands

401
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,445
on his secret experiments.

402
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:31,717
(mysterious music) 
(zipping)

403
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,189
- (gasps) Oh my God, Jay, are 
you alright?

404
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,593
(dramatic music) 
(gasping)

405
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,929
- It is unfortunate for 
you that you're here.

406
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,397
I cannot let you leave alive.

407
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,131
- If anyone's going to die here 
today,

408
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:46,932
it's going to be you.

409
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,434
- Women are not meant to fight.

410
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,370
They're meant to cook my 
food and massage my feet.

411
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,204
- Oh, I'm going to fuck you up

412
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,105
twice as hard for that 
statement.

413
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,373
- You cannot defeat me.

414
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,208
I'm a martial arts master.

415
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,478
(tense Asian music)

416
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,652
(glass shattering) 
(grunting)

417
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,721
(intense music)

418
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,056
- Alright, tough guy, I 
need to know who sent you.

419
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,691
- No, I won't tell you!

420
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,258
- Wrong answer!

421
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:14,593
- You will never know!

422
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,394
(groaning)

423
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,395
- Feel like talking yet?

424
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,496
I can break your balls for 
hours.

425
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,832
- Okay, I was working for Glitz 
Records.

426
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,200
- I need names!

427
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,535
- I would rather die than talk.

428
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:26,238
I will be dead in one second.

429
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,842
- Damn it!

430
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:31,176
Poisoned himself.

431
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:33,946
(tense music)

432
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:34,680
- [Boss] So, professor,

433
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,416
how's our little project coming 
along?

434
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:39,885
- It will be finished in a few 
days.

435
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,655
I must admit, it is my best 
work.

436
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,225
- [Boss] Good, we're ahead 
of schedule for once,

437
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,661
and I'm looking for some sexy 
results.

438
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,830
The world will be amazed when

439
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,332
they see what we've done.

440
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:56,502
I will rule the music industry 
thanks

441
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,071
to your newest and greatest 
achievement.

442
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:02,407
No one will be able to oppose 
me.

443
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,377
(upbeat music)

444
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,548
(audience applauds)

445
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,685
- In case you've just joined us,

446
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:17,156
I am talking to the pop 
music sensation Sexina.

447
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,624
(audience cheering and 
applauding)

448
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,225
So, I hear you're doing a big 
contest.

449
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,794
Can you tell me a little about 
it?

450
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:23,629
- Sure, Lauren.

451
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,098
Well, it's a contest for 
high school students.

452
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:26,532
- Mm?

453
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,667
- The winner gets to 
spend the day with me,

454
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,302
and then I perform for 
free at their high school.

455
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,870
- I think that's terrific.

456
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,873
I always think it's good to 
give something back to the fans.

457
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,741
Don't you agree?

458
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,408
- [Crowd] Yes!

459
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,543
(audience cheering and 
applauding)

460
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:41,013
- Sexina, Lance Canyon's 
album is climbing the charts.

461
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,049
Some people think that he's 
gonna outsell your last album.

462
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,651
How do you feel about that?

463
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,919
- I'm fine with it.

464
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,888
I really think there's plenty of 
room

465
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,957
in pop music for more than one 
performer.

466
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:52,958
- [Crowd] Aww.

467
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:56,662
- I have to ask you this, 
because everyone wants to know.

468
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,497
Are you seeing anybody?

469
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,932
- [Crowd] Ooh!

470
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,767
- No, I'm not.

471
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,334
- [Crowd] Oh.

472
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,335
- Really?

473
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:06,338
Such a beautiful girl with no 
boyfriend.

474
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,510
- Well, I don't really have 
time to go out and meet men,

475
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:12,778
I'm always working.

476
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:14,913
- That's sad.

477
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,614
- [Crowd] Oh.

478
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,349
- Anyway, it's time to take a 
call

479
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,283
from one of your biggest fans.

480
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,484
Hello, you're on the air.

481
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:23,755
- Sexina, I think you are so 
beautiful.

482
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:28,393
My question is would you ever 
kiss a girl?

483
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,461
(crowd gasps)

484
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,262
- Sara, is that you?

485
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,697
(phone clicking) 
(dial tone ringing)

486
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:32,831
- Well.

487
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,968
You really are a great talent, 
th anks for being on the show.

488
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:36,868
- Thanks for having me.

489
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,904
- Our next guest is a man.

490
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:39,605
(audience jeering)

491
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,707
But he's an author who wrote a 
bo ok

492
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,142
about how much he loves his 
wife.

493
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,377
- [Crowd] Aww.

494
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,979
- But he loves watching 
football.

495
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:47,613
(audience jeering)

496
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,514
- But he loves giving foot 
massages.

497
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,115
- [Crowd] Whew!

498
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,049
- But he's cheap with money!

499
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:51,750
(audience groans)

500
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,352
We'll have him next after 
this commercial break.

501
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,321
(upbeat music)

502
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,091
- [Man] We're clear!

503
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,126
- I can hardly believe 
that such a beautiful girl

504
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,127
doesn't have a boyfriend.

505
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,996
- I know, it's just hard 
for me to find a man

506
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,864
that really does it for me, you 
know?

507
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,766
Someone that isn't 
intimidated by my strength

508
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:11,536
and my intelligence, and 
really has the same interests.

509
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:12,271
It's hard.

510
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,772
- I know just the guy for you.

511
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,807
He is a friend of my 
husband and the two of you

512
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:16,708
could hit it off.

513
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,776
- Thanks Lauren, I appreciate 
it,

514
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,811
but you know, I just don't 
have the time right now.

515
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,047
I'm working on a huge case, 
record,

516
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,716
and I'm just too busy.

517
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:29,621
- I am Lauren, and I don't 
take no for an answer.

518
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,860
- [Man] And we're back in five, 
four.

519
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:38,597
(slow jazz music)

520
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,433
- So, Ralph, what do you do for 
a living?

521
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,501
- I'm an agent.

522
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,337
I represent Tom, Julia, the 
Pitt.

523
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:47,039
All the big names, you know.

524
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,640
- Cool, do you like it?

525
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,243
- I have two summer homes, three 
Bentleys.

526
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,511
What's not to like?

527
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,146
- I asked you if you like your 
job,

528
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,147
not if you like the money.

529
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,248
- Isn't that the same thing?

530
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,216
(sighs)

531
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,385
- Do you listen to music?

532
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,954
- No, I don't listen to music.

533
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:03,555
- You don't?

534
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,624
I thought everyone listened to 
music.

535
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:06,325
- Not me.

536
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:07,793
I like talk radio.

537
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,995
- Well, music is my life.

538
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:10,862
- Good for you.

539
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,700
- Hey, Sexina, what are you 
doing here?

540
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,469
- Hey Sara, I'm on a blind date.

541
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:18,670
This is Ralph.

542
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:20,105
- Yeah, hi Ralph.

543
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:25,344
Um, so, I didn't know you were 
dating.

544
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,313
- I'm not really, this is 
just something Lauren set up.

545
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,481
- Lauren, huh?

546
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,718
- Uh, Sara, do you know 
where the bathroom is?

547
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:36,588
- Yeah, it's at the back of 
the restaurant on the left.

548
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,290
- Thanks, excuse me a second, 
Ralph.

549
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,525
- No problem, I'm not going 
anywhere.

550
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,031
- So, Ralph, is it?

551
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,899
- Yeah.

552
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:48,433
- Yeah.

553
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:52,704
Um, I don't think you want to 
date Sexina.

554
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,373
- Why not, she's hot?

555
00:22:54,706 --> 00:23:00,912
- Yes, she is hot, but 
she also has herpes.

556
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:04,616
- Really?

557
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:09,221
- Yes really, and not just 
regular herpes,

558
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:13,625
we're talking hardcore, raging 
herpes.

559
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,560
- Wow, thanks for telling me.

560
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,695
- No problem.

561
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,633
(patrons chattering)

562
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,538
- Sorry about that.

563
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,572
So, are you ready to order?

564
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:32,277
- Actually, something 
came up, very important,

565
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:33,145
and I'm going to have to go.

566
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,513
- You can be honest with me 
Ralph.

567
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,249
You're not my type either, 
I know it's not working out.

568
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,784
- I'm not your type?

569
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,951
Who are you to talk?

570
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,219
- What's that supposed to mean?

571
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,621
- You can keep your herpes!

572
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:43,288
- What?

573
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,857
What the hell does that mean?

574
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,894
- I received an invitation for 
you

575
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,296
to go to Lance Canyon's big 
party tonight.

576
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,097
I think you should go.

577
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,732
You'll get a lot of free 
publicity there.

578
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:54,966
- Sounds good, what time?

579
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,569
- Uh, it says get there at 
eight,

580
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,738
so I would arrive about 
midnight.

581
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,207
(upbeat jazzy music)

582
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,210
(crowd chattering)

583
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,689
- Do you think I'll get to 
beat somebody up tonight?

584
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,824
- We're here to have fun 
Chainsaw,

585
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,525
not to beat people up.

586
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,427
- Beating people up is fun.

587
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:23,361
(chuckling)

588
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:27,599
- Well, well, Sexina, glad 
to see you could make it.

589
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,100
- I wouldn't miss this party, 
Lance.

590
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,802
Especially when your album's so 
hot.

591
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,437
- Oh, what can I say?

592
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,105
I got the goods.

593
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,874
- Such modesty.

594
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:39,177
- (chuckles) So um, who's your 
friend?

595
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,412
- The name's Chainsaw.

596
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,379
- He's my bodyguard.

597
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:44,049
- Well, make sure you keep him 
on a leash.

598
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,450
(growling)

599
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,285
- Relax, Chainsaw, relax.

600
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,622
And uh, who's your friend?

601
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:51,923
- Oh, her name is not important.

602
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,327
What's important, she's 
a first rate skank.

603
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,595
(giggling)

604
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,630
- You really think I'm first 
rate?

605
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,932
- Oh, yes baby, yes you are.

606
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,535
(speaks foreign language)

607
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,737
- Oh, you are so sweet.

608
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,274
(laughing)

609
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,809
- And the Bush twins are here 
tonight,

610
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,010
have you ever met them before?

611
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,078
- No, I haven't.

612
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,513
- Oh girl, you should.

613
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,015
The two are magnificent whores.

614
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,551
(snorting)

615
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,057
- Anyway, Lance, um,

616
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,893
how do you like working at Glitz 
Re cords?

617
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:28,727
- It's the best record label in 
the world,

618
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:30,562
what's not to like?

619
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,063
Nah, I'm sorry guys,

620
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,799
but I must attend to my other 
guests.

621
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,102
(laughing)

622
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,503
- Just say the word and I'll 
give him

623
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,338
the beating of his life.

624
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:41,873
- Yeah, really.

625
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,842
That's alright Chainsaw, 
it's not necessary.

626
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:46,745
Didn't Lance Canyon do a public 
service

627
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,079
announcement against drugs?

628
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,247
- Yes he did.

629
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,416
I remember the slogan.

630
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,585
Lance don't need weed to 
succeed.

631
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,420
(sighing)

632
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:56,354
Pee-ew!

633
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,123
- What a scumbag.

634
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,392
- Hey, everybody.

635
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:01,860
Let's have a round of applause 
for the man

636
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,495
who's throwing this great party 
tonight.

637
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,429
Lance Canyon!

638
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:08,233
(cheering and applauding)

639
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,268
Share some words with the good 
people.

640
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,103
- I want to thank you all 
for attending my party.

641
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,040
Hey, there's still 
plenty of weed, cocaine,

642
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,608
and ecstasy for everyone.

643
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,210
As well as heroin, crystal meth,

644
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:23,181
horse tranquilizers, vicodin, 
xanax,

645
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,984
modern igloo, yellow 
jackets, black beauties.

646
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,386
You guys name it, and we got it.

647
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:29,154
(laughing)

648
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,422
- [Man] Yo, I love this guy, 
he's awesome.

649
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:31,823
- You know Chainsaw,

650
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,160
as much as I can't stand 
the guy, he is kind of cute.

651
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,128
- Oh, I hate cute.

652
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,764
- Now, I want you all to give a 
big,

653
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,000
big round of applause for 
another big star

654
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,468
that's in the house tonight.

655
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,870
The one and only Sexina.

656
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,673
(applauding)

657
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,310
Sexina, I am so glad that I can 
tell you,

658
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,413
and everyone else here the great 
news.

659
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,185
My brand new album has just 
outsold yours.

660
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,520
(applauding)

661
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:05,824
I am now the biggest star in pop 
music.

662
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,058
(laughing)

663
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,026
- Chainsaw, I've had enough.

664
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,294
Let's get out of here.

665
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:16,301
- And, fellas, I'm going 
to do your ladies tonight.

666
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,102
(laughing)

667
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:18,303
- Pick me, Lance! 
- Me first!

668
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:20,171
- Thank you!

669
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,641
- Hey.

670
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,075
I wanted to sign your list.

671
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,978
- Great, umm.

672
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:30,715
(tense music)

673
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:31,616
Here you go.

674
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,685
- I'm so glad you're doing this.

675
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,153
I am such a big Sexina fan.

676
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,722
- So am I.

677
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:39,824
- I've seen you around.

678
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:41,059
What's your name?

679
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:41,960
- I'm Vera.

680
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,428
- My name's Zach.

681
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,530
- I know. (laughs)

682
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,198
You're quarterback of the 
football team.

683
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,833
- I hope you don't think 
I'm some dumb jock.

684
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,435
- No, I don't think that at all!

685
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,202
- That's good to hear.

686
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,004
Everyone thinks I'm 
this big football hero,

687
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:54,639
which is fine and everything, 
but,

688
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,074
I wonder if anyone will ever 
know

689
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,243
that I have this fondness 
for French poetry,

690
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,412
or how passionate I am 
about animal rights.

691
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,248
- I think it's great to 
have lots of interests.

692
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:03,948
- Thanks.

693
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,451
You know Vera, you're pretty 
cool.

694
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,253
- I think you're pretty cool 
too.

695
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,754
- I'll see you around.

696
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,223
- See you around, Zach.

697
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,026
- Zach, you've been working out, 
huh?

698
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,728
Atta'boy.

699
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,435
- Vera like, mm.

700
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,770
- Mm, Coach like.

701
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:27,672
(tense music)

702
00:28:27,739 --> 00:28:29,607
- [Boss] Good, you're here, have 
a seat.

703
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:30,775
- You needed to see me?

704
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,844
- [Boss] Yes, I have a job for 
you.

705
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:33,945
- What is it?

706
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,847
- [Boss] I want you to 
take care of the man

707
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,383
we hired to kidnap Van Bunson.

708
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,219
- What do you mean, take care of 
him?

709
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,089
- [Boss] Oh, don't act so naive, 
Lance.

710
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,724
I want you to kill him.

711
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,325
- Hey, hey, hold on, alright?

712
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,194
Hey, I'm a musician, not a 
killer.

713
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,463
- [Boss] You'll be 
anything I want you to be.

714
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:52,263
- I won't do it.

715
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,499
- [Boss] Lance, Lance, testicle 
brains,

716
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,302
don't forget that I'm the 
one who signs your checks.

717
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,740
I am the one who owns 
your houses and your cars,

718
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,476
and I can make those things go 
away.

719
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,611
And if those things go away,

720
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,813
the women will go away too.

721
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,348
- Hey, hey, hey!

722
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,351
Not the women, not the women.

723
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,556
Fine, I'll do it, but I don't 
like it.

724
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,265
- Hey, uh, Lance.

725
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,533
Thanks for having me over.

726
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,869
- Uh, yeah, cool man.

727
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,004
Hey, you want something to 
drink?

728
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,106
- Yeah, sure, I'll have a drink, 
thanks.

729
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,142
- Huh, yeah, yeah, cool man.

730
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,279
Um, do you know by any 
chance why you're here?

731
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,748
- No, the boss just told me to 
come over.

732
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:48,353
- Oh, well, you did such 
a good job kidnapping

733
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,122
Van Bunson that he asked me 
to take care of you, man.

734
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:51,689
- Really?

735
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:52,824
- [Lance] Yeah.

736
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,363
- We going to get some 
hookers or something? (laughs)

737
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:02,834
- (chuckles) Well, not exactly.

738
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,736
- No hookers?

739
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,404
- Not today.

740
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,673
(grunting)

741
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,609
(dramatic music)

742
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,989
(coughing)

743
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:27,759
(dramatic music)

744
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,562
- Would you stop strangling me?

745
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,006
(coughing)

746
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,342
(dramatic music)

747
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,578
How many times are you 
going to strangle me?

748
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,446
- I thought you'd be dead by 
now!

749
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,747
- Well, I'm not.

750
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,584
(dramatic music)

751
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,291

(dramatic music)

754
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,736
- Well, why didn't you use 
that in the first place?

755
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,571
- Sorry man, I'm new at this.

756

- Hey Stevie, what can I do for 
ya ?

807

- Actually, it's more like 
what I can do for you.

808
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,864
I know a guy who works 
down at Glitz Records,

809
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:22,400
and he's got some information 
he'd like to share

810
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:23,835
with you and Sexina.

811
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,003
For a price of course.

812
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,471
- That's great news.

813
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,039
I'll let her know right away.

814
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,273
Thanks so much, Stevie.

815
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,641
- Just remember to tell her

816
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,144
to meet him at Rosco's Chicken 
Pit,

817
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:34,512
tomorrow at noon.

818
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,247
She'll recognize him because 
he's the guy

819
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,749
with the eye patch.

820
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,451

(upbeat rock music)

822
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,025
- So you the man I'm supposed to 
meet?

823
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,159
- Yes, I am.

824
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,596
I wasn't expecting such a 
beautiful woman.

825
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,898
- Enough with the flattery.

826
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,233
I came here because I was told

827
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,801
you could give me what I need.

828
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:58,870
Let's get down to it.

829
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,173
- Wow, you move really fast.

830
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,275
Don't you think we should 
slow down a little bit.

831
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,411
I mean, get to know each other 
fi rst.

832
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,812
- Why do you want to get 
to know each other first?

833
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,715
- Because it's the polite thing 
to do.

834
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,150
- You know what I'm here for.

835
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,418
Are you going to give it to me 
or not?

836
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,821
- Of course I'm going to 
give it to you. (chuckles)

837
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,556
I can't wait to give it to you.

838
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,092
Where do you want to do it?

839
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,828
I mean, we could go to a hotel 
or we could go to your place.

840
00:34:24,462 --> 00:34:25,229
We can't go to my place,

841
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:26,464
because I still live with my 
parents.

842
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,532
- Why do you want to go 
somewhere else?

843
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,567
Why can't we just do it right 
here?

844
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,337
- You want to do it right here?

845
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,472
- Yeah.

846
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:36,107
I want to do it right here.

847
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:36,774
- Are you sure?

848
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:37,475
- Yeah, I'm sure.

849
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,911
Come on, enough with the small 
talk.

850
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,412
Let's get down to business.

851
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:42,947
- Do you want me to 
show you what I've got?

852
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,183
- Do you have something to show 
me?

853
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,818
- Oh yeah. (chuckles)

854
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,686
Oh yeah, I've got something to 
show you.

855
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:50,421
Do you want to see it?

856
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,289
- Yeah, I want to see it.

857
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:52,156
- Yeah? 
- Yeah.

858
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:52,757
- Right now?

859
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:53,291
- Right here, right now.

860
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:54,158
Come on, show me what you got.

861
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:55,359
- Okay, alright.

862
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,295
- Wait, what are you doing?

863
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:58,496
No, what, ugh!

864
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,398
Ugh, what are you doing?

865
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,233
- I'm giving you what you want.

866
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,167
- I don't want that.

867
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,670
- Hey, over here.

868
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:09,207
- Who the hell are you?

869
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,608
- Aren't you Debbie, my blind 
date?

870
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:11,509
- No!

871
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,677
- Then where's my date?

872
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:16,581
- Are you Phil?

873
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:18,082
- Yeah, I am, are you Debbie?

874
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,685
- You're sick, and tiny.

875
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:21,652
(laughing)

876
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,521
- I'm a grower, not a shower.

877
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,191
Hey, wait!

878
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,463
(tense music)

879
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:35,433
- So much for being 
inconspicuous.

880
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,701
- Alright, so what have you got 
for me?

881
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:38,369
- First things first.

882
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,171
Where's the money?

883
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,043
- What happened to your eye?

884
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:46,644
- Nothing.

885
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,614
I just wear this to look 
cool for the ladies.

886
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:51,782
- Okay.

887
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,251
So what do you know?

888
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,253
- I saw the professor at Glitz 
Records.

889
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,755
He came out of the president's 
office.

890
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,789
- What do you think they're 
using him for?

891
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:00,324
- Cyborg robots.

892
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:01,392
- Why on earth would 
they want him for that?

893
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,861
- I don't know, that's 
up to you to find out.

894
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:04,962
- Do you think Lance Canyon is 
involved?

895
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,098
- Lance is definitely involved.

896
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,399
He's tight with the boss,

897
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,468
and he has access to the 
professor.

898
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,870
Also, his album is really, 
really--

899
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:14,338
- If you say really hot, 
I will break your nose.

900
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,506
- Okay, relax.

901
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,675
I guess you're not a Lance 
Canyon fan.

902
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:19,677
- Have you ever actually seen

903
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:20,745
the president of Glitz Records?

904
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,881
- No, he never leaves 
his penthouse office.

905
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:24,749
- That's so strange.

906
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,918
Why would a CEO of a major 
record label

907
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:27,952
keep such a low profile?

908
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:28,653
- I don't know,

909
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,155
but only a select few 
have actually seen him.

910
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,391
He moves in the shadows.

911
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:35,326
- It's very suspicious.

912
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,562
(tense music)

913
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,031
I broke into Lance Canyon's 
house

914
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:41,599
looking for some more clues.

915
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,669
Since he is Glitz Record's 
golden boy,

916
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,370
I wanted to know how involved 
he's been

917
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,272
in Van Bunson's kidnapping,

918
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,708
and what the hell this is all 
about!

919
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,617
(dramatic music)

920
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,955
(door creaking)

921
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:09,927
- Hm.

922
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,330
I guess I'm hearing things.

923
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,333
- [Woman] Lance, come back to 
bed!

924
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,435
- Okay, but I hope you're ready 
for that

925
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,338
all-you-can-eat Lance buffet.

926
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,877
(tense music)

927
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,062
- Hey Vera.

928
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,097
How's the contest going?

929
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,432
- Well I got all the signatures 
I need.

930
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:49,166
- That's great news.

931
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,636
- Yeah, except now I have to 
write an essay about myself,

932
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,204
and I'm having a hard time with 
it.

933
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,639
I mean, how much can a person 
write

934
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,375
about Paula Abdul and unicorns?

935
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:00,378
- Yeah, it's hard to look 
deep down inside yourself.

936
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:01,145
I know it is for me,

937
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,914
but you're a really cool and 
smart person.

938
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,317
I'm sure you'll be able 
to write a great essay.

939
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:07,818
- Thanks, Zach.

940
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:09,353
- No problem.

941
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:10,888
(sighing)

942
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:11,522
I have to go.

943
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,124
I almost forgot, I have 
to carry Crystal's books

944
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,859
to her remedial English class.

945
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,594
See you later.

946
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:20,931
(dreamy music)

947
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:23,634
- I know exactly what I'm 
going to write my essay about.

948
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,408
I'm a student at Britney High 
School.

949
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:34,278
I'm what most people 
would describe as a loser.

950
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,280
I don't drink or smoke.

951
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,349
I am not a beautiful 
cheerleader.

952
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,650
I don't have any friends.

953
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,686
Actually, I spend most of my 
time learning

954
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,587
and trying to get into a good 
college.

955
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,157
There's this popular girl named 
Crystal

956
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,758
that always makes fun of me.

957
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,428
She calls me names like 
fatty and lard-ass.

958
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,597
I really hate the way she 
and her friends treat me.

959
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:56,367
There's also this boy I really 
like.

960
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:57,468
His name is Zach.

961
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,870
I think he could fall in love 
with me,

962
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,573
but he's dating that total bitch 
Crystal.

963
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,475
Please pick me as the winner

964
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,210
so I can teach that snobby bitch

965
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,411
and her friends a lesson.

966
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:11,982
Oh, and I really want to see 
Zach naked.

967
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:12,983
And have sex with him.

968
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,654
- I think we found our winner.

969
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:18,222
(tense music)

970
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:20,791
- I have accomplished 
wh at you asked of me.

971
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,661
- [Boss] Very good, 
we're ahead of schedule.

972
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,363
- Lance, listen to me.

973
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:28,966
You must not be a part of 
this diabolical scheme.

974
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,703
- Sorry professor, but I 
care about money and women.

975
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,506
(chuckles) And you offer me 
neither.

976
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,375
Hey boss, I've got to leave, 
man.

977
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:38,876
I've got to meet Paris in ten 
minutes.

978
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,845
I've got some boning to do.

979
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,147
(groaning)

980
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,417
- Please, I beg you.

981
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,051
Don't do this--

982
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:47,551
- [Boss] Enough!

983
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:51,722
Do I have to remind you 
what I'm capable of?

984
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,391
- Here they are.

985
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,993
(dramatic music)

986
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,728
I call them Top That.

987
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,664
They are the ultimate 
in cyborg technology.

988
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,967
You can program them to sing, 
dance,

989
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,604
act, or speak in any way you 
want them to.

990
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,807
Never again will you have 
to find real human beings

991
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,542
to mold into stars.

992
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,878
They will follow your every 
command,

993
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:16,213
and learn a song or a dance move

994
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,149
with the flick of a switch.

995
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,818
They are the ultimate pop group.

996
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:23,621
- Oh, you've really outdone 
yourself, professor.

997
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,258
Tell me about each member of the 
group.

998
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:30,161
- Dustin is the young, cute one.

999
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,531
Then there's Jake, he's a bad 
boy.

1000
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,634
The one with the dreadlocks is 
G-Dog,

1001
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,003
he loves reggae, so you know 
he's down.

1002
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,938
Then there's Anarchy Al,

1003
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:46,110
he's a punk rocker who 
hates authority figures.

1004
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,711
- [Boss] Mm, they look yummy.

1005
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,680
Especially that Dustin.

1006
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:52,850
I want to see them in action.

1007
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,585
- Okay boys.

1008
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,420
Hit it.

1009
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:59,623

- [Boss] Oh, they're perfect.

1024
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:35,759
Especially Dustin.

1025
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,661
Everyone from teenage girls

1026
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:40,130
to horny Catholic priests will 
love them.

1027
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,967
I'll start informing the 
press about them right away.

1028
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:47,137
The world has been craving 
a group like Top That.

1029
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:48,706
More than crack.

1030
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,876
- Good God, what have I done?

1031
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,746
(dramatic music)

1032
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:09,159
(dreamy music)

1033
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,327
- Zach!

1034
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:12,229
What are you doing?

1035
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,597
- Oh, nothing.

1036
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,666
- Tell me how beautiful I am.

1037
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,102
- You're the most 
beautiful girl in the world

1038
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:18,836
- You're right.

1039
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,905
I am the most beautiful girl in 
the world.

1040
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,273
- I think I'm going to be sick.

1041
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,909
- I just decided that I'm going 
to let you

1042
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,311
take me out to an 
expensive dinner tonight.

1043
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,014
- I don't have the money 
for that, maybe next week.

1044
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,048
I have an idea.

1045
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,818
Let's make a picnic basket 
and eat underneath the stars.

1046
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,755
- (sighs) I don't think so.

1047
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:41,759
Find a way to get the money 
and pick me up at seven.

1048
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,594
Okay, toodles.

1049
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:57,274
(upbeat dance music)

1050
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,581
- Hey, what's up everybody?

1051
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:05,282
Welcome to Cool TV.

1052
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:06,450
I'm your host Onski,

1053
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,453
and today I'm going to introduce 
to you

1054
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,089
the next big thing in pop music.

1055
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:16,293
From the people that 
brought you Lance Canyon

1056
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,730
comes this amazing new group, 
Top That!

1057
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:20,898
Yeah!

1058
00:43:20,965 --> 00:43:21,899
(audience cheering)

1059
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,902
I want to introduce you 
first to the members.

1060
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:25,603
Dustin.

1061
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,838
- I'm just a sensitive guy who's 
looking

1062
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,573
for the right girl to give my 
love to.

1063
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,109
- Aw, what a sweetie!

1064
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,279
And next, we have Jake.

1065
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,915
- You girls, you don't want 
to get too close to me,

1066
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:39,750
'cause I'm a heartbreaker.

1067
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:42,620
- Wicked man, yeah.

1068
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,856
Yo, yo, yo, give it up for 
G-Dog!

1069
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:49,693
- Ya mon, I like smokin' 
the trees and reggae beats.

1070
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,828
- Whoa.

1071
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,564
And finally, Anarchy Al.

1072
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,668
- I don't give a shit about 
you, or this fuckin' show.

1073
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:58,802
- Yeah!

1074
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:02,373
This is it, the guys of Top 
That.

1075
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:06,010
We here at Cool TV think 
th ey're totally crunk.

1076
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:10,547
In fact, they crunked in 
at a 10 on our crunk meter.

1077
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:13,417
So tune in tomorrow for the 
world premiere

1078
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:18,355
of their crunktastic new 
video, Love on the Deep End.

1079
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,057
- Oh my God!

1080
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,191
That group is going to be the

1081
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,193
biggest thing in musical 
history.

1082
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:25,362
We need to do some damage 
control, quick.

1083
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:28,232
We have to make sure that you're 
twice as cool as Top That.

1084
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:29,767
- But there's something 
strange about them.

1085
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,568
I can't put my finger on it, 
though.

1086
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:34,438
- All I know is those guys 
could put us out of business.

1087
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:36,774
- Anyway, I'd rather 
talk about the contest.

1088
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,676
I picked a winner, her name is 
Vera,

1089
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:39,476
and she goes to Britney High.

1090
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,245
- Great, I'll inform the school.

1091
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,212
- Okay, thanks.

1092
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,715
- Sexina, you're going to have 
to face Top That eventually.

1093
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,150
They're sexy and they know it,

1094
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:47,985
and that's a lethal combination.

1095
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,054
- Don't worry, everything will 
be fine.

1096
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,356
Top That has got nothing on me.

1097
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,459
(dramatic music)

1098
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,427
- [Zach] Hey Vera.

1099
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,064
- You probably think that 
note was pretty lame.

1100
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,399
- No, actually, I thought 
it was pretty sweet.

1101
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:04,134
- Where's the but?

1102
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:07,604
- But I have a girlfriend, 
so I can't date anyone.

1103
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:08,405
- Can't you just be honest

1104
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:09,406
and tell me you don't want to 
date me

1105
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,941
because you don't find me 
attractive.

1106
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:12,976
- Vera, that's not true, 
I do find you attractive.

1107
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,480
I just happen to be in a 
committed relationship.

1108
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:20,584
I really enjoy your company, 
and I want us to be friends.

1109
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:23,253
- Okay, that sounds cool.

1110
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:24,288
We can be friends.

1111
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:24,955
- Good.

1112
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:25,856
I have to go.

1113
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,192
I volunteer at this animal 
shelter.

1114
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,994
I think of all those cute little 
animals that need my help.

1115
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,764
(sighs) It just tears me apart 
inside.

1116
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,066
I've gotta go.

1117
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,267
See you later.

1118
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:38,302
- Later, Zach.

1119
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,706
(sigh) Friends, my ass.

1120
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:45,242
I'm gonna get me a piece 
of that sweet booty.

1121
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:51,815
(upbeat blues rock music)

1122
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,696
- I'm really glad to see 
you're still in one piece.

1123
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,197
- Come on, I'm a tough 
chick, you know that.

1124
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:08,332
- I know.

1125
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,301
I've got a bad feeling about 
this case.

1126
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,670
I think you're in a little over 
your head.

1127
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,105
- I know, but I can't quit now.

1128
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:16,306
- I knew you'd say that.

1129
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,008
- I got really good 
information from your guy

1130
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,943
at Glitz Records, thank 
you for arranging that.

1131
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:21,211
- I'm glad I could help.

1132
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,846
Do you remember when me and your 
dad

1133
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:25,482
tried to get you to listen 
to some Robert Johnson,

1134
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,718
but all you cared about was 
Madonna?

1135
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,153
(laughing)

1136
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,988
- He would get so mad at me.

1137
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,691
I wish he was here with us right 
now.

1138
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:35,225
- Me too.

1139
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,160
Can I get you a beer?

1140
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:37,895
- No, no, no, I've got to go, 
thank you.

1141
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:38,996
- Oh, I understand.

1142
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,465
You're a busy woman.

1143
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:43,100
(dramatic music)

1144
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,468
Please, consider giving up this 
case.

1145
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,503
I don't want anything happening 
to you.

1146
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:47,971
- [Sexina] I'll be fine.

1147
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:49,807
- Maude, down!

1148
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:51,575
(dramatic music)

1149
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,810
- Not you Stevie!

1150
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:56,346
(dramatic, funky music)

1151
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,956
(gasping)

1152
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:09,593
(grunting)

1153
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,540
(bear roaring)

1154
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:24,641
(groaning)

1155
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:25,909
- No, bear!

1156
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:28,312
Stop, please!

1157
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,815
I have great respect for your 
kind.

1158
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:34,451
I give thousands of dollars 
to Save the Bears every year,

1159
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,587
please stop attacking that man,

1160
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,522
I need to get information from 
him.

1161
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:39,389
(roaring)

1162
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:40,591
No, please!

1163
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:43,260
(screaming)

1164
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,662
Step away from my witness!

1165
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:49,466
This bear is killing my witness!

1166
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,041
- Mom, you should knock 
before you come into my room.

1167
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,978
- I'm sorry honey, I 
got so excited I forgot.

1168
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:01,812
- What is it, mom?

1169
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:03,680
- There's a boy here to see you.

1170
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:04,514
- What?

1171
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:05,916
- And he's cute.

1172
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:06,917
- Who is it?

1173
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:07,851
- His name is Zach.

1174
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,419
- Zach?

1175
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,356
Is here now, in my house?

1176
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:13,023
- Yes!

1177
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,024
I'm going to send him right up.

1178
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:16,093
- Oh, just don't embarrass me.

1179
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:24,401
- Here you go Zach, this is 
Vera's room.

1180
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:24,968
- Thanks.

1181
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:25,936
Hey Vera.

1182
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:27,638
- Hi.

1183
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,709
- Well, I'll just leave you two 
alone.

1184
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:42,119
- She's great, my mom is the 
same way.

1185
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:43,687
- Have a seat.

1186
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,692
- Well, I came by because we 
have

1187
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,628
this big math test tomorrow, 
and I thought maybe

1188
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:53,997
you might be able to help me 
study?

1189
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:57,334
- Yeah, of course.

1190
00:48:59,403 --> 00:49:02,639
- Oh, I didn't know you 
were into French poetry!

1191
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:03,640
- Yeah, I love it.

1192
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,243
- That is so cool!

1193
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:07,311
- Yeah.

1194
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,181
I have to go downstairs 
and get my math book.

1195
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,388
- Oh, do you have a 
calculator I could borrow?

1196
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,791
- Oh sure, there should be one 
in my desk.

1197
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:21,591
- Thanks.

1198
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,169
(laughing)

1199
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:36,440
(buzzing)

1200
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,682
- Hey Zach, atta'boy.

1201
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,287
(gasping)

1202
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,490
(sighing)

1203
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:55,692
- I brought you my, vibrator!

1204
00:49:58,729 --> 00:49:59,596
Soda pop?

1205
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,601
Vera?

1206
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:16,046
(phone ringing)

1207
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:17,614
- Hello?

1208
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,648
- Sara, it's me.

1209
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:19,649
Did you get the results 
of the fingerprints?

1210
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,752
- They belong to a guy 
named Richard Flack.

1211
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:24,921
He did five years at San 
Quentin for kidnapping.

1212
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:25,789
- I knew it.

1213
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,558
He kidnapped professor Van 
Bunson for Glitz Records,

1214
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,794
and then they had him 
killed so he wouldn't talk.

1215
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,596
The president of Glitz 
Records must be the one

1216
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:34,765
that's pulling all the strings.

1217
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,167
Sara, an assassin just tried to 
kill me.

1218
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,469
- Oh no, Sexina, are you 
alright?

1219
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,438
- I'm fine, but the assassin's 
dead.

1220
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,040
He got mauled by a bear before I 
could

1221
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:44,841
get any information out of him.

1222
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:46,276
- Fucking bears!

1223
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,011
- Sara, he killed Stevie.

1224
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,080
- Oh my God, Sexina.

1225
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:51,681
I'm so sorry.

1226
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:54,017
But listen, we have to act fast.

1227
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:56,319
Van Bunson's daughter is getting 
worried

1228
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,554
that we're not going to find her 
father.

1229
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,189
- I know, I have to come up with 
a plan.

1230
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:00,891
I need to meet with the 
contest winner today,

1231
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,992
but I'll call you after that.

1232
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:02,993
- Should we inform the police?

1233
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,529
- Don't say anything, we have 
to handle this ourselves.

1234
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:07,697
They could be on the Glitz 
Record payroll.

1235
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,332
Just tell Rachel we're very 
close

1236
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,801
to getting her father back, 
okay?

1237
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:11,868
- Be careful.

1238
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,437
I don't know what I would do if 
anything

1239
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,505
happened to that hot body of 
yours.

1240
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:20,877
- Congratulations, Vera!

1241
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:22,045
- Congratulations for what?

1242
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:22,679
- Didn't you hear?

1243
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,414
They just announced it in the 
cafeteria.

1244
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,016
- I never eat in the cafeteria.

1245
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,918
- You won the Sexina contest.

1246
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:28,418
- Really?

1247
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,854
- Yes, and she's coming here 
this afternoon to meet you.

1248
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,089
- That rules!

1249
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:35,092
- Oh, I can't believe that total 
pig Vera

1250
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:36,660
is talking to your man, Crystal.

1251
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,361
- Yeah, she better check 
herself.

1252
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,264
- Looks like I have to 
teach bacon bits a lesson.

1253
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:42,365
(grunting)

1254
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,433
- I can't believe I'm going 
to get to meet Sexina.

1255
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,235
- I knew you could do it.

1256
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:49,272
- Zach, what are you doing?

1257
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,341
- Oh, I'm just talking to Vera.

1258
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:52,576
You know her, right?

1259
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:55,011
- Yeah, I know her, but I 
don't actually talk to her.

1260
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:55,579
- Why not?

1261
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:56,947
- 'Cause she's a loser!

1262
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:58,048
- [Girls] Duh.

1263
00:51:58,148 --> 00:51:59,049
- Hey, that's mean.

1264
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:00,717
- Don't be stupid, Zach.

1265
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:01,852
You know she's pathetic.

1266
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,254
Why do you think she sits 
out here for lunch every day?

1267
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,456
Because nobody likes her.

1268
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,191
- I'm sorry about this, Vera.

1269
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,526
She's totally out of line.

1270
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,361
- It's okay, I'm used to it.

1271
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,363
She talks to me like this every 
day.

1272
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:15,699
- Is that true?

1273
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,135
Answer me, is that true?

1274
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,569
- Of course it's true.

1275
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,904
I mean, just look at her.

1276
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:24,741
- I think she's pretty.

1277
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:25,742
- [Girls] What?

1278
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:26,910
- Are you serious?

1279
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:28,578
She's so ugly!

1280
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,380
- Right now, you look like the 
ugly one.

1281
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,781
- Yeah, you ugly bitch!

1282
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:34,117
- Yeah, consider yourself 
dumped, Crystal.

1283
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,352
- Are you fucking kidding?

1284
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,587
- You heard me, it's over.

1285
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,123
- Ugh, you are so going 
to regret this, Zach.

1286
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,526
- Why don't you go home 
and cry yourself to sleep?

1287
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:45,562
- You know what, have fun with 
lard ass.

1288
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,165
Be careful, she just might eat 
you.

1289
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,834
- Isn't it time for you 
to go throw up your lunch?

1290
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,770
(screaming)

1291
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,472
- [Crystal] God!

1292
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:56,806
(tense music)

1293
00:52:56,873 --> 00:53:01,811
- Man, I can't wait to 
until I start my world tour.

1294
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:05,115
I'm going to be knee deep in 
pussy.

1295
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:07,117
And with Top That opening up for 
me,

1296
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,452
it's going to be the 
biggest tour in history.

1297
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,288
- [Boss] Oh, Lance, yes, yes.

1298
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,758
It'll be the biggest tour in 
history,

1299
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,960
but I have some changes in mind.

1300
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:18,094
- What kind of changes?

1301
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,630
- [Boss] Top That is going to 
headline it,

1302
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,233
and you're going to be the 
opening act.

1303
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:25,235
- What?

1304
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:27,771
How dare you, huh?

1305
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:28,939
I'm Lance Canyon.

1306
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:32,275
The hottest singer and the 
best piece of ass in pop music.

1307
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:33,543
- [Boss] Oh, hey Lance.

1308
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,179
Dustin has twice the ass you do.

1309
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,747
- My ass cannot be topped.

1310
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,950
I'm number one, you got that?

1311
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:41,251
Numero uno.

1312
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:42,419
I open up for no one.

1313
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:43,386
- [Boss] You're right, Lance.

1314
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,622
You're number one, today.

1315
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,558
But once Top That's album comes 
out,

1316
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,927
you're going to be yesterday's 
news.

1317
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,930
- Hmm, no, you're wrong.

1318
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,266
I'll be number one forever.

1319
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,133
- [Boss] Oh, Lance.

1320
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,570
Your stupid mind doesn't get it.

1321
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:03,306
Top That is the next big thing.

1322
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,710
Today I'm going to have them 
crash the free Sexina concert.

1323
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,014
When they upstage her at her own 
show,

1324
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,350
the media will be all over them.

1325
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,353
Top That will be ten times 
bigger

1326
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,221
than you are Lance, baby.

1327
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,291
I'm afraid your 15 minutes are 
almost up.

1328
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:22,292
You should consider yourself 
lucky to

1329
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:25,996
open up for newest pop 
sensation.

1330
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:28,131
- That wasn't part of our deal.

1331
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,633
- [Boss] I'm changing the deal,

1332
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,703
and if I were I'd pray I 
don't change it any further.

1333
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,344
(heavy breathing)

1334
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,550
- Hi, you must be Vera.

1335
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,353
- I love you, I'm your biggest 
fan!

1336
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:51,821
- Nice to meet you, too.

1337
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:53,823
This is my bodyguard, Chainsaw.

1338
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:54,891
- Hi Chainsaw!

1339
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:55,525
- Oh oh!

1340
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,093
Touch me and I'll kill you.

1341
00:54:57,193 --> 00:54:58,194
- Is he always like this?

1342
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,996
- Yes, he is.

1343
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,332
So, would you like to go to 
lunch?

1344
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,433
- Would I?

1345
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:07,404
(upbeat music)

1346
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,240
This is so cool.

1347
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:12,375
I can't believe I'm having lunch 
with you.

1348
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:13,877
(laughing)

1349
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:14,878
- Thank you.

1350
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,180
- Hey Sexina, can I have 
your autograph please?

1351
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,081
- Sure.

1352
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:20,050
- [Waiter] Thanks.

1353
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,218
- So tell me about you, Vera.

1354
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:22,986
- What do you want to know?

1355
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,654
- Is there a boy at school that 
you like?

1356
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:26,990
Oh, so there is a boy.

1357
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,594
- Yeah, his name is Zach, and 
he's so hot.

1358
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:32,562
- Sounds awesome.

1359
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:33,630
Does he know that you like him?

1360
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,533
- Yeah, but he's really popular,

1361
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,234
and he was dating the 
coolest girl in school.

1362
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:39,002
- Was dating?

1363
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:40,236
Wait, is he single now?

1364
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:40,937
- Yeah.

1365
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,539
He broke up with his girlfriend 
today.

1366
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:43,640
- Well now's your chance.

1367
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,875
- I know, but oh no, he 
would never want to date me.

1368
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,177
Guys never want to date me.

1369
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:50,513
- Vera, listen to me.

1370
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:52,649
I have to be honest with you.

1371
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,384
I personally read your essay.

1372
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:57,420
I already know about Zach 
and the mean girls at school

1373
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,522
and how they're always bullying 
you

1374
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,925
I picked you, Vera, because I 
admire you.

1375
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,993
- You admire me?

1376
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,330
- Yeah, it took so much 
courage to write that down

1377
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:09,099
and express how you feel.

1378
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,434
You're stronger than you think, 
Vera.

1379
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:19,642
- Maybe I am, but I still 
wish Zach wanted to date me.

1380
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:23,146
- Whew, stuffed!

1381
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:25,482
You know what?

1382
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,583
I have an idea.

1383
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:28,451
You know what cheers me 
up more than anything?

1384
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:29,319
- Your dildo?

1385
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,187
- No, shopping!

1386
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:34,424

1404
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,752
- Yeah, but you didn't buy me 
anything.

1405
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:38,087
- Vera, listen to me.

1406
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:40,290
You don't need a new 
dress to look beautiful.

1407
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:42,926
You're already beautiful.

1408
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,196
Just the way you are.

1409
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:47,897
- But you bought like, 20 
dresses.

1410
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,866
- I'm talking about you, not me.

1411

Alright, I'm just kidding.

- When am I going to be 
released?

1419
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:08,251
- You'll be released 
when the boss says so.

1420
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,319
- Please, have some mercy,

1421

to have you here.

1463
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:00,730
- My pleasure.

1464
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:02,332
This is my bodyguard Chainsaw.

1465
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:04,467
- Nice to meet you, Chainsaw.

1466
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,970
- I want you to know that if 
any of your students act up

1467
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,273
I'll be more than happy to 
take care of them for you.

1468
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,809
- I might actually take you up 
on that.

1469
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:16,813
I wish all of students 
could be like our Vera here.

1470
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:18,247
- Thanks Principal Matthews.

1471
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:20,316
- She is the one that 
made all this possible.

1472
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,753
- You told me you were 
close to finding my father.

1473
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,922
- We are, we just need a little 
more time.

1474
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:27,390
- You have had enough time.

1475
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:31,027
I want my father found now, 
and why are there pictures

1476
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:32,962
of Sexina all over the walls?

1477
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,299
- (gasping) Daddy!

1478
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:37,200
- I love you, Princess!

1479
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:39,469
- I have been so worried about 
you!

1480
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:42,905
- The president of Glitz 
Records kidnapped me.

1481
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,442
He made me build a cyborg boy 
band.

1482
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:47,877
- Do you mean Top That?

1483
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,679
- Yes, they're robots.

1484
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:52,048
They have been scientifically 
cr eated

1485
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:53,983
to be the ultimate boy band.

1486
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:54,984
- Yeah, we must destroy them

1487
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:56,285
before they take over the world.

1488
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:57,920
- Aren't you in on this plot, 
Lance?

1489
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,823
- He was, but then he helped me 
escape.

1490
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,091
- How do we know we can trust 
him?

1491
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,160
- Look, I know I've 
been an ass in the past,

1492
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,028
but I changed.

1493
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:07,096
I don't want to be a criminal no 
more.

1494
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:08,665
Criminals go to jail,

1495
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,067
and chicks in jail have penises.

1496
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:13,336
- How did you find us, father?

1497
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,338
- I had a chip implanted in the 
back

1498
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:16,839
of your head when you were a 
child,

1499
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:18,641
so that I would always 
know where you were.

1500
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,678
- Wow, dad, that's pretty 
creepy.

1501
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,279
- What did you expect?

1502
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,147
I'm a scientist.

1503
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,215
- Come on guys, we've got to 
get down to the high school.

1504
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:26,683
- Why?

1505
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:27,917
Is Sexina in danger?

1506
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,185
- Look, Top That's going to 
crash the show

1507
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,087
and try to outperform 
her, and if that happens,

1508
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:32,755
they'll be impossible to stop.

Today reminds me of when 
I was in high school

1521
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,029
and the Osmonds came to perform.

1522
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:14,797

1526
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:24,073

1533
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:39,489
I want to bring out a friend of 
mine.

01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:42,024
She is the reason that I'm here 
today.

1535
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:45,461

And trust me, you're going to 
need me.

1560
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,058

I can handle these chumps on my 
own.

- Yo, are you with us 
or against us, Lance?

1563
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:56,632
- I'm with Sexina, and you know 
what?

1564
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:59,202
I think it's about time 
people knew about your secret.

1565
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,636

(electricity crackling)

1572
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:19,121
- So that's why the 
professor was kidnapped.

1573
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,991
To create a boyband made out of 
cyborgs.

1574
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,093
- That's right, biotch.

1575
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:24,894
- One thing I don't get though 
is,

1576
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:25,995
why would you help me, Lance?

1577
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:29,131
- Well, because Top That could 
become more popular than me.

1578
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,933
- You really betrayed us, Lance,

1579
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:32,902
and that really hurts my 
feelings.

1580
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:37,473
- Yeah, so we're going to 
have to kill all you fuckers.

1581
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,009
- Chainsaw, you have my 
permission to kick some ass.

1582
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:41,444
- I want a piece of the 
bodyguard.

1583
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:44,146
- Finally I get to beat someone 
up.

1584
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,681
(upbeat jazzy music)

1585
01:04:45,748 --> 01:04:46,716
(fist thudding)

1586
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:49,285
(grunting)

1587
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:54,924
- Oh, not my face, my beautiful 
face!

1588
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:56,525
- God I love hitting you!

1589
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:58,461
(whimpering)

1590
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:01,030
(grunting)

1591
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,770
(groaning)

1592
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,339
- If you want Sexina, you're 
going to have to go through me.

1593
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,340
- Vera!

1594
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:12,675
- Okay.

1595
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,378
- Quick, someone throw me a 
football!

1596
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:18,147
Thanks!

1597
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:19,615
(grunting)

1598
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:20,883
(screaming)

1599
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,018
- Oh shit!

1600
01:05:23,352 --> 01:05:24,654
- Vera, are you okay?

1601
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:27,123
- I'll be alright, keep 
fighting.

1602
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:29,892
- Don't worry Sexina, 
I'll take care of her.

1603
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,394
- You're a good man, Zach.

1604
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:35,998
(dramatic music)

1605
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:36,866
- Sexina!

1606
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,267
- What, Sara?

1607
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:39,135
- I need to tell you something.

1608
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:40,002
- I love--

1609
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,705
(electronic beeping)

1610
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,574
(electricity crackling)

1611
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,109
(buzzing)

1612
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:49,745
- I'm too sensitive for this!

1613
01:05:49,812 --> 01:05:51,347
- Pretty boy.

1614
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:52,982
- It's time to die now.

1615
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:54,617
- Quick, somebody get me a 
guitar.

1616
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:55,885
- Here you go, dude.

1617
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,119
- Thanks, man.

1618
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:58,621
I'm going to rock you 
harder than a hurricane.

1619
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:02,525
(intense electronic guitar 
music)

1620
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:06,162
- You're next in line for 
an ass whooping, pretty boy.

1621
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:08,164
- No, I beg you, please don't 
hurt me, no!

1622
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,398
- Shut up.

1623
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,602
- I'm not ready to rock.

1624
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,706
- Hurting you makes my dick 
hard.

1625
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:20,142
- Rock overload.

1626
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:23,679
(electricity crackling)

1627
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:26,515
(buzzing)

1628
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:27,216
- Hell yeah!

1629
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:28,117
(audience cheering)

1630
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:30,252
- Looks like we took care of Top 
That.

1631
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,854
- I've got it, dude.

1632
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:33,456
- Thanks, man, here you go.

1633
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:37,059
- Amazing, you guys defeated Top 
That.

1634
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:39,462
- Professor, how did you escape?

1635
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:40,863
- Lance broke me out.

1636
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,799
Thanks to him I've been reunited 
with my lovely daughter.

1637
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:46,769
- I'm never going to let you 
out of my sight again, daddy.

1638
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,537
- That's so nice, Lance.

1639
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:49,505
Guess I was wrong about you.

1640
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:52,108
- Look, I know now that 
what I was doing was wrong.

1641
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:54,076
I'm going to fight on the 
si de of good from now on.

1642
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:54,944
(fists thudding)

1643
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,112
- Good to hear that.

1644
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,446
- Was that good for you?

1645
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:58,881
It's good for me.

1646
01:06:58,948 --> 01:06:59,815
- Chainsaw!

1647
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,519
(electricity crackling)

1648
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:04,720
Chainsaw, you can stop now,

1649
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:06,088
I think he's dead.

1650
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:08,557
- But I wasn't even tired yet.

1651
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:09,959
- Sexina!

1652
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:10,826
- Oh, Sara, are you okay?

1653
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,461
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1654
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,530
I'm just glad to see you alive.

1655
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,365
- I'm glad to see you're okay 
too, Sexina.

1656
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:18,100
- That's so sweet, Lance.

1657
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:19,135
(dramatic music)

1658
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:22,104
- That was very brave 
of you to stay and help.

1659
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:23,072
- I had to.

1660
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:25,274
You see Vera, I realized 
something today.

1661
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:26,876
- What is it, Zach?

1662
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:29,145
- I know now that I love you.

1663
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,880
- Oh, Zach!

1664
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:31,981
I love you too.

1665
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:32,982
- [Audience] Aww.

1666
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,216
- Zach, I can't believe my ears!

1667
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:36,185
Have you lost your mind?

1668
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:37,553
You're supposed to be my man!

1669
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,688
You're supposed to be loving me, 
remember?

1670
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:42,491
I'm hot and I won't let you dump 
me

1671
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,927
for this fat, stupid loser.

1672
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:46,362
- You know what Crystal?

1673
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,765
I have had enough of you.

1674
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,369
(grunting)

1675
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:56,572
(crowd murmuring)

1676
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,910
How do you like me now, bitch?

1677
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:04,113
(audience laughs)

1678
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,416
- She got beat down!

1679
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:10,186
(peaceful music)

1680
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:13,522
- Wow Vera, I'm really glad 
yo u stood up to her like that.

1681
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:15,858
- Yeah Vera, that was a 
first rate ass kicking.

1682
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:16,892
- Yeah!

1683
01:08:16,959 --> 01:08:18,127
- I really do love you.

1684
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:18,894
- I know.

1685
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,931
- See, Vera, I knew you'd get 
your man,

1686
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:22,665
because you were--

1687
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:25,301
- Yeah, beautiful all along, I 
get it.

1688
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:28,571
- I've been wanting to do this 
all day.

1689
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:34,643
(crowd whistling and cheering)

1690
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:39,582
(moaning)

1691
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:50,226
(mellow, funky music)

1692
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:57,833
(crowd shouting)

1693
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,475
- They're in love, huh?

1694
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:07,810
That's what I really want, 
Sexina.

1695
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,179
To be just like the two of them.

1696
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:11,480
- I thought all you really 
wanted was

1697
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:14,250
to have sex with any 
woman that would let you.

1698
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:17,553
- I just did that to fill 
the empty void in my heart.

1699
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:21,257
All I really want is to fall in 
love.

1700
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:25,227
- I avoid falling in love 
by working all the time.

1701
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:28,297
- Maybe we're not as 
different as you think we are.

1702
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,767
- Maybe not.

1703
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:32,601
(crowd cheering)

1704
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:35,337
- Sexina, why would you kiss 
Lance?

1705
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:36,238
- I can't explain it, Sara,

1706
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,874
I just feel a connection with 
him.

1707
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:40,776
- So do I, Sexina.

1708
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:42,411
You're my soul mate.

1709
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,780
- But what about me, Sexina?

1710
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,918
- Don't worry Sara, you'll 
find a man of your own one day.

1711
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:49,852
- Ooh!

1712
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:54,089
- I've had enough.

1713
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:55,057
(dramatic music)

1714
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:58,427
Do you really think I'd let 
you get away with this, hm?

1715
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:01,964
You've destroyed my plan to 
take over the music industry.

1716
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:05,534
Top That with sweet, sweet 
Dustin,

1717
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:09,038
was gonna take the world by 
storm

1718
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:13,342
and provide me with 
power beyond imagination.

1719
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,579
Now that you've killed my dream,

1720
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:19,114
I must kill all of you.

1721
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:21,850
Starting with my daughter, 
Sexina.

1722
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:22,651
(crowd gasps)

1723
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:23,252
- What?

1724
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:24,687
- Who would have thought the 
little girl

1725
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:27,790
I threw away in a garbage 
can all those years ago

1726
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:31,393
would grow up to trash all my 
pl ans.

1727
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:32,161
- You're lying.

1728
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:33,929
- I killed your mother,

1729
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:38,300
but I didn't have the 
heart to kill you, Sexina.

1730
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:42,037
Of course, I would live to 
regret that.

1731
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,274
I have to admit though, I was 
proud of you

1732
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:48,477
when you became such a big star.

1733
01:10:48,544 --> 01:10:50,312
I always kept track of you.

1734
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:54,216
I guess I always thought 
in the back of my mind

1735
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:57,453
you would want revenge 
for what I did to you.

1736
01:10:57,519 --> 01:10:58,587
- You can't be my father.

1737
01:10:58,654 --> 01:11:00,923
- Oh, search your heart Sexina.

1738
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:02,791
You know it to be true.

1739
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:03,926
- Then why did you kill my 
mother?

1740
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:08,097
- She never supported my 
plans for world domination.

1741
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:12,368
She wanted me to get a 
nine-to-five job like a square!

1742
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:15,170
So I shot her.

1743
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:18,040
Just like I'm going to shoot 
you.

1744
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,008
- Kill me instead!

1745
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:19,441
(crowd gasps)

1746
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:21,143
- Settle down, brown eyes.

1747
01:11:21,577 --> 01:11:23,212
I'm going to kill all of you 
Lance.

1748
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,547
I'm sorry but my daughter

1749
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,716
will have the honor of dying 
first.

1750
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:29,084
- If I really am your daughter,

1751
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:30,619
I bet you won't be able to kill 
me now

1752
01:11:30,686 --> 01:11:31,854
just like you couldn't do it 
then.

1753
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,989
- Oh, I'm sorry, but you're 
wrong.

1754
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:36,091
(gun clicking) 
(crowd gasping)

1755
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:37,293
(gun firing) 
(groaning)

1756
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:40,429
(crowd screaming)

1757
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:43,332
So this is how it ends for me.

1758
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:44,967
Shot in the back.

1759
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:48,003
You win, Sexina.

1760
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:54,043
(sighs) Now I have to face your 
mother.

1761
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:57,646
(crowd screaming)

1762
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:00,015
- Looks like I showed up just in 
time.

1763
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:01,617
- Man, we didn't need you.

1764
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:04,219
I was two seconds away 
from killing him myself.

1765
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:05,287
- You saved my life, Sal!

1766
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:07,923
- Oh, hey, I'd do anything 
for my favorite client.

1767
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,525
- Hey Lance, looks like you're 
going

1768
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:11,126
to need some new representation.

1769
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:12,094
- No thanks, man.

1770
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,829
I'm retiring from the music 
business.

1771
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,831
- I can't believe my father was 
evil.

1772
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:17,866
- You're nothing like him, 
Sexina.

1773
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,436
You make the world better for 
everyone.

1774
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,071
- He was a second away from 
killing me.

1775
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:24,173
- Yeah, but today wasn't your 
day to die.

1776
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,409
You still have so many people to 
help.

1777
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:29,478
- You're right.

1778
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:34,116
- Sexina, there is something 
I have to tell you.

1779
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:35,918
- What is it?

1780
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:37,286
- I'm a robot.

1781
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,620
(crowd gasping)

1782
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:39,722
- Is that true?

1783
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:41,323
- Yes, it's true.

1784
01:12:41,690 --> 01:12:43,926
I created Lance as a pleasure 
robot.

1785
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,961
He has been programmed with more

1786
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:49,431
than 1,000 techniques to 
bring a woman to orgasm.

1787
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:50,032
- Really?

1788
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:53,936
(chuckles) Well, sounds 
like a happy ending to me.

1789
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,140
- Can you make me one 
of those robots, daddy?

1790
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:00,743
(moaning)

1791
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:03,412
- That's it, I'm leaving!

1792
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:05,681
I'll see you at the office!

1793
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:07,983
- What has gotten into her?

1794
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:10,953
- I think she's just mad 
'cause I forgot to thank her.

1795
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:13,455
(mumbling)

1796
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,327
- Hey, how 'bout you sing us a 
song?

1797
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,628
- I think it's a great idea.

1798
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,096
- Let's rock this joint!

1799
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:21,764
