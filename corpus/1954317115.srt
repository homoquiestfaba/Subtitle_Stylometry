1
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:13,117
<i>Now we can tell this, comes back it,
had the pot PCP or some other shit</i>

2
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:16,772
so even though they're six
nobody wants to go near the guy!

3
00:04:16,835 --> 00:04:18,905
So Charlie is the first
to paralyze taser.

4
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:23,315
He tases the son of a bitch
who starts twitching go, go, go.

5
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,223
<i>We laugh.
This guy</i>

6
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:31,224
ag, ag, ag

7
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,430
So then Pete and Danny
they put at paralyzer taser too.

8
00:04:35,772 --> 00:04:37,715
-Excuse me.
-By the time we're done

9
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:41,252
we've all got the taser aligned
the guy still don't go down.

10
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:43,308
He just stand there going to...

11
00:04:46,592 --> 00:04:49,051
I hate to interrupt this fun memories.

12
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,399
but can one of you,
possibly, help me?

13
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:57,855
Well, that depends, young lady,
just what kind of help you need.

14
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:00,179
I'm here to report
a missing person.

15
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,894
-And who are you?
-My name is Larissa Morgan and

16
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:06,490
I'm looking for my younger sister.
We live together.

17
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:11,339
-How long has your sister been missing?
-She is been going for nearly three days now.

18
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,743
-You do have a fight?

19
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,885
No. Nothing like that.

20
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,562
She went at jogging two nights ago
before dinner and never came back.

21
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:25,567
Her name is Annie.
This is a picture.

22
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:28,732
Nice tits.

23
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:32,200
That's all you can say?

24
00:05:32,942 --> 00:05:36,420
A young girl had gone missing,
who knows what might happen to her...

25
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,771
and the only thing you can do
is making some sexist crack...?

26
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:43,435
Please, calm down, miss.
The Inspector is only trying ...

27
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:47,125
I know what he is trying say
and I do not appreciate it.

28
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:50,198
You stick up for each other, don't you?

29
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:55,148
Now, what exactly are you going
to do about finding my sister?

30
00:05:55,686 --> 00:05:58,374
So where your sister allegedly go missing?

31
00:06:00,697 --> 00:06:05,814
She left our apartment in Lincoln Heights
at aproximately  6:00 p.m. on tuesday.

32
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:08,105
Was the last I've seen ever.

33
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:18,097
Well. I want you to be sure and
include all that when you fill up this forms.

34
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:20,818
And leave it on the desk out.

35
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:27,744
Nice ass.

36
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:31,191
Inspector, do you think
this could be related to the others?

37
00:06:34,028 --> 00:06:37,775
-Miss Morgan, wait up.
-What happens. I forgot my e-mail address?

38
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:38,379
No

39
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:42,477
I just want to apologize
for the way inspector treating on her.

40
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:44,162
Sometimes he can be rude.

41
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,538
Rude, insensitive, asshole?

42
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:52,881
Yeah. You can say that.
Unfortunately, it also happens to be my boss.

43
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:57,172
Well. I'm sorry to hear that.  But I have
problems of my own, or you don't pay attention?

44
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:01,240
I wise. I mean see that's
what I want to talk to you about

45
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:03,909
Is it has been other
disappearances in your area.

46
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:05,405
Disappearances?

47
00:07:05,951 --> 00:07:07,984
All the other girls were residents there.

48
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,786
The Mary Magdalene Halfway House
for Troubled Girls.

49
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,089
Every month or so they report
another one missing.

50
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:17,943
Can they just run away? I mean the place
doesn't exactly look like club med

51
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:19,719
This is that the Inspector thinks.

52
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,084
Nice weather has meant
anything in the media about it.

53
00:07:22,617 --> 00:07:25,683
-But you think something different?
-I didn't..

54
00:07:26,695 --> 00:07:28,864
Until I heard
of your sister, Miss Morgan.

55
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:34,366
-Call me Larissa. And you are?
-Sergeant Sheen. Dick Sheen.

56
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:38,203
And I suppose you
like to keep your weapon nice and clean.

57
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,956
-I beg your pardon?
-Skip it.

58
00:07:42,194 --> 00:07:44,806
Why right discovering
and find out what they know.

59
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:47,780
Hold down. You just can't walk over there
and start asking questions.

60
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:49,330
And why not?

61
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:53,438
The people who run that place
aren't just going to volunteer information

62
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:54,533
to somebody who comes in
off the streets

63
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:57,085
They bunch of close to religious types

64
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,676
-But I am her sister.
-Yeah, I am a cop.

65
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,476
Is my job to do the investigation.

66
00:08:02,444 --> 00:08:04,270
That's not what your boss thinks.

67
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:06,272
Oh. And...?

68
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:08,463
He is an asshole.

69
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,529
Good morning, Sister.

70
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:30,723
Yes

71
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:33,135
Good afternoon ma'am... sister.

72
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:35,815
I am sergeant Sheen
Lincoln Heights Division.

73
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,130
Is Father Fogerty?

74
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:40,643
Yes, but he is hearing
the girls confessions.

75
00:08:41,343 --> 00:08:46,466
-That can take hours.
-I see.  I hope that you tell me something, sister

76
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:47,597
Sister Cecilia.

77
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:51,475
Have you adding more
girls run away, disappeared?

78
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:55,648
Heavens no. We would have
report it if they have.

79
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,364
And any of the other girls,
have ever come around again?

80
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,854
No, not yet. We're living in constant hope
that the poor lost souls will be return to us.

81
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:08,966
I'm sure you do. By the chance,
have you seen this girl.

82
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,656
She is not one of ours.
I'd surely remember her... face.

83
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:20,038
-Who is this child?
-Her name is Annie. She is from the area.

84
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,893
She's been reported missing too.

85
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:28,638
Oh. I see. Well.
I'll be sure we pray for her safe return.

86
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:32,007
And I'll be happy to show this
to father Fogerty, if you like.

87
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:35,688
No. I guess that won't be necessary.

88
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,102
After all if she had come right here
probably you would know.

89
00:09:39,137 --> 00:09:41,370
Yes. There isn't much to get finally here.

90
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,778
Well. Good day, sergeant.

91
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:55,937
If they do know anything
I'm sure are not going to volunteer it.

92
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:58,265
But...

93
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,692
Is more easy in there.

94
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:04,272
But you mentioned in your report

95
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:07,153
that your sister wore in
these yellow and black radio headphones?

96
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:10,809
Yeah. She had them on the last
time I saw her.

97
00:10:11,414 --> 00:10:12,741
She wore everywhere.

98
00:10:13,817 --> 00:10:18,380
Well. There is this guy there,
handyman, janitor, something.

99
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:19,739
Flippy type.

100
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:20,692
And...?

101
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:24,786
It may not mean nothing, but
he is wearing the same type of headphones.

102
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:28,432
Dick, we've got to go back.
It does have to be hers.

103
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:31,206
Wait a minute. Not so fast.

104
00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:35,638
Don't you see? That is too much
of a coincidence.

105
00:10:35,673 --> 00:10:38,648
Those people could have done
something to Annie

106
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:41,418
I can't go in there and poke around
without a search warrant.

107
00:10:41,867 --> 00:10:44,778
-Get one.
-Ha, ha. Up but this time with evidence

108
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:46,033
And I'll have my badge for.

109
00:10:46,505 --> 00:10:48,202
What are you gonna do that?

110
00:10:49,768 --> 00:10:52,684
I'll talk to the Inspector.
He'll listen me.

111
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:54,722
Are you out of your fucking mind?

112
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:57,014
Are you ever
expecting to get promoted

113
00:10:57,015 --> 00:11:00,182
to keep going off half-cocked
on these wild ass hunches.

114
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,138
You're not been professional.

115
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:05,591
You should know better in the
let some hysterical broad

116
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:08,711
lead you around
and make up a full "I love you"

117
00:11:08,743 --> 00:11:10,714
Stop thinking with your dick, Dick

118
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:12,260
But what about the headphones?

119
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:15,186
Circumstantial bullshit, that's what.

120
00:11:15,221 --> 00:11:18,580
You are telling me that young women
under protective care

121
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,324
of the Mary Magdalene Halfway House
are being abducted

122
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,657
and possibly harmed in some way

123
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:27,716
and the representatives of the
Catholic Church

124
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:29,250
are somehow trying to cover it up.

125
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:32,775
Now. Who wind up?
Hell, who is gonna believe that?

126
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:36,569
Now get out of my office
before I have you suspended

127
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,028
for being such a moron.

128
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,811
I suppose I'm on my own now.

129
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:52,379
I'm really sorry. I feel like a ???.

130
00:11:52,414 --> 00:11:55,696
At least you tried it.
Is more than anyone else has done.

131
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:59,663
Yeah, but I just wish there was
some way to make it up to you.

132
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:10,445
Nice of you to invite me.

133
00:12:10,992 --> 00:12:13,040
Yeah, I needed company.

134
00:12:14,593 --> 00:12:17,324
You'll miss much your sister.
What a fool I am.

135
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,582
We lived in our house since
that our mother died.

136
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,620
I'm in my dad's room somewhere,
he is ??? work for us.

137
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:41,988
Just gotta find her.
you gotta help me.

138
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,360
I want it, but how?

139
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:48,156
We can get inside this place.

140
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,147
You can take me in a girl troubled.

141
00:12:51,182 --> 00:12:52,720
No way.
It's too risky.

142
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,823
It's the only way.

143
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:59,488
Once I'm inside
under cover a final is going on.

144
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,308
And what if I know what you want to...

145
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:05,444
Down a level? This keep me help.

146
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:10,603
And if he is okay?
No, I can't you do it

147
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:15,011
-Oh yes. You will.
-No, I will not.

148
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,553
-Take it please ...
- NO. No way.

149
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,215
I'm gonna do it with or without
your help.

150
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:30,026
So. Yes or no?
Yes ...

151
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:32,314
or no.

152
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:38,001
All right. I'll help you do it.

153
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,870
Thanks.

154
00:13:49,206 --> 00:13:51,491
Hello again, sergeant.
What brings you back here?

155
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:55,172
Official business, sister.
This young lady is in trouble.

156
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,296
-Oh, really. What kind of trouble?
-The same old story I'm afraid.

157
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,222
Miles from home, in a strange city,
no money, no friends.

158
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:05,236
We picture for panhandling
outside a bus station.

159
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:08,307
That's no really a crime,
but it's only a matter of time ...

160
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,500
before she's on the drugs,
prostitution, armed robbery

161
00:14:13,191 --> 00:14:15,407
Police says, sister,
is this a life worth saving?

162
00:14:15,574 --> 00:14:18,454
Of course. We'll take good care for..

163
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,112
Larissa.

164
00:14:19,113 --> 00:14:21,775
Well Larissa.
Step this way

165
00:14:22,157 --> 00:14:25,395
Thank you, sister. I'll come back
in a couple of days and make sure she's OK.

166
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:29,299
For really that won't be necessary.
Everything will be just fine.

167
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,625
Like this. I'll show the office around.

168
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,163
And what is your last name?

169
00:14:41,705 --> 00:14:44,130
Morgan.
Larissa Morgan.

170
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,877
Well Miss Morgan.

171
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:47,983
I'm sure you'll find a better life here
than you did in the streets.

172
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:50,115
I'm sure well.

173
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:54,752
Good, because if you screw up
here, you'll wish never ???.

174
00:14:58,624 --> 00:14:59,585
<i>Yeah.</i>

175
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:01,211
It's Sister Cecilia.

176
00:15:01,246 --> 00:15:01,752
<i>What?</i>

177
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:03,057
Yes. We have a new guest.

178
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:03,926
<i>Come in.</i>

179
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:17,136
Ah.

180
00:15:17,175 --> 00:15:18,051
Father.

181
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,383
Welcome.
A jelly bean?

182
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:22,122
No.

183
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:27,193
Well. This halfway house was named
after Saint Mary Magdalene...

184
00:15:27,197 --> 00:15:31,655
an adulteress who converted
by completely dedicated herself to Christ

185
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:39,418
-Just how do I do that?
-Trust and faith, my dear.

186
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:43,301
And in return we will take care
of all your needs.

187
00:15:43,869 --> 00:15:46,921
The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want...

188
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:50,996
Yes, my dear. That's is exactly.
This is one place in the world

189
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:53,417
where you can always be safe.

190
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,379
Thank you, father.

191
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,840
Now report back to sister Cecilia
and she'll show you around

192
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,067
Oh, and, God be with you, my child.

193
00:16:15,065 --> 00:16:18,439
This is the rec room. That's where you'll
be spending the most of your time.

194
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:22,166
When you will not be in church
or in the classroom or

195
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,487
doing chores.

196
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:44,514
So, I'll leave you to introduce yourself
and make new friends.

197
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,190
Who the fuck are you?

198
00:16:58,795 --> 00:16:59,938
Who the fuck wants to know?

199
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:02,350
I was happy to be the number
one bitch around here.

200
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,515
I can see that.

201
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:07,495
You got a smart mouth.
Maybe I'd shut it for you.

202
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,299
-You and your army
-Me and my homegirls.

203
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:12,907
How would you like us
to rearrange your face?

204
00:17:12,942 --> 00:17:17,095
-Uou, welcoming the new girl I see.
-What itch to you?

205
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,613
I see when you start playing
rugby you have a nasty fall.

206
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,372
After all Angelina, you could slip
on this hour born and crack your scope.

207
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,259
Wide open.

208
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,561
-Wide open you...
-Shut up

209
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:33,293
Have your way for now.
Just be careful bending over in shower.

210
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:34,765
Yeah, why is that?

211
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:39,464
'Cause you never know when a little
dutch boy might come along in shadows. Dyke!

212
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:49,379
Thanks for stopping in like that, but
I probably could have handled it.

213
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:51,556
You look like you make it only

214
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:56,152
Angelina fights dirty and besides
she's always got Shelby and Sheila  with her.

215
00:17:56,328 --> 00:18:00,054
-What's your name?
- Em... Larissa. And you are?

216
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:04,594
My friends call me Cherry-pie.
I do hope we can be friends.

217
00:18:10,586 --> 00:18:12,766
You know you'd be watching
your ass around here.

218
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:14,585
It may be not be anyone
around to save you the next time.

219
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:17,985
I see you later.

220
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:27,451
Make sure you do a thorough job ladies
and lunch is in a half an hour.

221
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:31,148
And remember, cleanliness is
next to godliness.

222
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:01,087
What dirty old.

223
00:20:17,143 --> 00:20:19,951
Don't ??? you know
is going onto yet.

224
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:35,920
-Are you going to ???, Father Fogerty?
- Not today. May your way is for to do.

225
00:21:03,231 --> 00:21:03,824
What...?

226
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,898
Bed time, ladies!

227
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:33,012
Come on! Everybody
at your room!

228
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:35,312
Let's go.

229
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,504
-Goodnight, Sister Cecilia.
-Goodnight.

230
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:42,183
-Goodnight Sister.
-Goodnight.

231
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:47,971
Goodnight.

232
00:21:54,173 --> 00:21:57,930
Goodnight. Don't forget
to say your prayers.

233
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:16,880
Just a minute.

234
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:20,912
Come in.

235
00:22:23,332 --> 00:22:25,970
It's me. I just wanted
to say goodnight.

236
00:22:26,465 --> 00:22:27,080
Goodnight.

237
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:31,018
Don't forget to turn your light out.
Sister Cecilia comes around in checks it.

238
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,114
??? the windows are the inside.

239
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:36,892
Don't have much privacy
around here, is there?

240
00:22:37,142 --> 00:22:38,851
Not much, no.
Goodnight.

241
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:04,612
<i>Hello.</i>

242
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:05,362
It's me.

243
00:23:05,938 --> 00:23:06,914
Are you alright?

244
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:08,625
<i>Yeah, I guess that could say that.</i>

245
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:11,583
This place has all the warmth
of a concentration camp.

246
00:23:12,313 --> 00:23:14,027
I told you it was not
good idea.

247
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:16,980
But our intention was to find out
what happened to Annie.

248
00:23:17,944 --> 00:23:21,602
Well, ???, can you check on this
father Fogerty character?

249
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:23,124
Do you suspect him?

250
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:27,363
Well. Can say that is twisted enough to vote
the marquee the share deciding saintness

251
00:23:27,398 --> 00:23:28,870
That does not prove anything.

252
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,458
Find away  out about him or the
rest of the staff.

253
00:23:32,941 --> 00:23:35,878
Okay. But if things get too strange,
just give me a call.

254
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:37,446
I can more than ???

255
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,768
Like a knight in shining armor?

256
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,122
Ah?

257
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:44,449
<i>Nevermind. Wait for me I call you</i>

258
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,793
??? into the ??? stop I'm not allowed
contact with the outside wolrd.

259
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:49,892
<i>Do you understand?</i>

260
00:23:49,956 --> 00:23:50,878
Right you then.

261
00:23:52,362 --> 00:23:53,791
Goodnight.

262
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:33,572
Well kid, this is it.

263
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:36,192
Again? But you're finished.

264
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:39,643
No. I meet a nice night ???
with ??? a stop.

265
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,376
-You are serious.
-Serious as a heart attack, baby.

266
00:25:42,946 --> 00:25:44,120
And you're coming with me.

267
00:25:44,348 --> 00:25:46,878
I don't know about this.
What if we get caught?

268
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:50,797
Is it worth the risk to get away from
Attila the nine in that proverbial priest?

269
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:54,248
??? handyman that trying to watch
when we're in the showers?

270
00:25:54,363 --> 00:25:57,046
Him too. That's why we gotta get away.

271
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,483
Me ???. ???

272
00:25:59,845 --> 00:26:04,875
-I know you well, but ...
-But what? Come and help me with this.

273
00:26:25,037 --> 00:26:28,898
Now. Are we going do it climbs down,
make it to the streets.

274
00:26:29,103 --> 00:26:30,692
There were home free.

275
00:26:31,387 --> 00:26:32,191
You go first.

276
00:26:32,192 --> 00:26:34,187
I can't. I feel afraid of heights.

277
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:36,233
Oh. Okay, I'll go first.

278
00:26:37,327 --> 00:26:38,793
It's make sure the knot not slip.

279
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:42,704
-Then what?
-Then you climb down after me.

280
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,132
I'll be there to catch you if you fall.

281
00:26:45,515 --> 00:26:47,344
-I don't know.
-Oh. Come on.

282
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:50,160
Who's my sweet baby bitch?

283
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:52,212
-I am.
-That's right.

284
00:26:52,742 --> 00:26:54,621
Now quit stalling and hang on.

285
00:27:24,461 --> 00:27:25,801
What's the fuck!

286
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:43,587
Oh, shit!

287
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:48,545
No!

288
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,292
What the fucking are you doing?

289
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:26,648
Let me go, you pervert!

290
00:30:26,749 --> 00:30:28,838
That's the fuck called the kettle black.

291
00:30:28,873 --> 00:30:33,501
Your deviant desires can
hardly be considered. No more.

292
00:30:35,528 --> 00:30:40,477
Sister Cecilia? What are you doing here?
What are you dressing like that?

293
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:43,173
We all have little secrets.

294
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:47,117
Look. I was trying to run away and
you catch me.  Alright?

295
00:30:49,563 --> 00:30:52,132
I'll take whatever punishment
he has in store for me.

296
00:30:53,613 --> 00:30:55,785
Oh, you're going to be punished.
You are right.

297
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,003
Like this!

298
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,110
Oh! Oh! Oh, my God!

299
00:31:09,963 --> 00:31:11,234
Oh! Oh, my God!

300
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:19,053
Oh!!! Oh, my God!!!

301
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,759
Your God wont save you now.

302
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:41,123
This sort of behavior
is entirely unacceptable.

303
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:48,400
I would like anyone who has
any information to

304
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:53,158
please, step forward, now.

305
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:06,070
I said ... anyone ...

306
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:09,954
Ah! Very well.

307
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:14,789
All privileges are suspended

308
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,749
and... there will be no dessert tonight.

309
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:25,132
Miss ???-pie, may I see you
in my office, please.

310
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:27,334
Now.

311
00:32:41,448 --> 00:32:43,706
How many get that little ??? for this?

312
00:32:43,803 --> 00:32:46,990
After is anything left over
after Father Fogerty ??? with her.

313
00:32:47,645 --> 00:32:50,841
Oh. That'is just a warmup
for what I have ??? in mind.

314
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:20,512
I'm sure she knows
more than she is telling.

315
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,252
??? she does or doesn't.

316
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:24,518
the girls till dawn.

317
00:33:24,553 --> 00:33:28,552
-Yes I know.
-Are you calling the police again?

318
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,208
We must report it,
just as we have all the others.

319
00:33:31,405 --> 00:33:34,477
What ??? to?
They can't find any of them.

320
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:36,401
That's not the point.

321
00:33:36,436 --> 00:33:41,130
-What is the point then?
-This grows our responsibility.

322
00:33:41,175 --> 00:33:42,839
We have a duty to do.

323
00:33:43,843 --> 00:33:45,849
Everything we can.

324
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:52,898
Shit!

325
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:57,405
Another one? When?

326
00:34:02,723 --> 00:34:04,892
Well, give me the name
and a description.

327
00:34:07,891 --> 00:34:08,629
Aha.

328
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:16,958
Oh. But will look into it.
You're welcome.

329
00:34:20,703 --> 00:34:21,812
Sheen is still out there.

330
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:23,325
<i>Yes, is there.</i>

331
00:34:23,576 --> 00:34:24,601
Send the man here.

332
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:32,963
Do you send me?

333
00:34:35,581 --> 00:34:39,953
You remember that girl from the other day,
the one who's looking for her sister?

334
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:44,820
-You mean at Miss Morgan.
-You are senior ???

335
00:34:45,598 --> 00:34:47,617
Why not? What would like?

336
00:34:49,262 --> 00:34:51,329
You too think ??? to me.

337
00:34:53,011 --> 00:34:56,508
Yeah. She did come to me
looking into the halfway house

338
00:34:57,209 --> 00:34:59,881
but you cue its entire suspicions
were unfounded.

339
00:35:00,095 --> 00:35:01,398
or something to that effect.

340
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:03,546
I did say that, didn't I?

341
00:35:05,756 --> 00:35:07,904
Some pretty crazy stuff
so after all.

342
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,085
Yes, sir.

343
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:14,305
-??? that be all?
-Yeah. That's for now.

344
00:38:53,326 --> 00:38:54,711
???

345
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:00,813
???

346
00:39:14,257 --> 00:39:18,484
Jesus!
What did he do to you?

347
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:22,467
Asks me some questions, that's all.

348
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:31,498
-What it happened to Eddie?
-She's gone.

349
00:39:35,781 --> 00:39:37,786
What really happened
to Eddie?

350
00:39:38,522 --> 00:39:43,767
She's gone. She's gone like the others.
That's all I know.

351
00:39:56,462 --> 00:39:58,730
Did you find anything out about
the missing girls?

352
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,644
No yet. That's can our here father.

353
00:40:02,126 --> 00:40:03,837
I told you everything I know
on the phone.

354
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,278
Another girl disappears from here.

355
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:08,710
So that makes six girls so far.

356
00:40:08,622 --> 00:40:09,730
<i>Five.</i>

357
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:10,947
What?

358
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:14,038
There are only five girls missing.
You said six.

359
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:16,434
<i>I must be thinking about
that other girl</i>

360
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:23,265
<i>I'm sorry. I'm afraid not.</i>

361
00:40:26,235 --> 00:40:30,181
Really. And what about the others,
you know,  the ones from here?

362
00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:33,351
Do you think that anybody from here
knows anything about them?

363
00:40:33,528 --> 00:40:36,602
Well. Naturally we question the girls
every single time,

364
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,706
but they always insist that
they know nothing.

365
00:40:42,197 --> 00:40:43,452
And you believe it?

366
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:45,475
What else can we do?
I mean...

367
00:40:45,932 --> 00:40:49,233
After all who knows
what goes in the minds of young girls...

368
00:40:49,362 --> 00:40:51,145
especially in the troubled ones?

369
00:40:52,803 --> 00:40:56,604
If it's all the same to you, Padre,
I'm just gonna a look around the grounds.

370
00:40:56,931 --> 00:40:58,654
You mean research the
premises?

371
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,328
Oh, nothing formal.
Do you understand?

372
00:41:02,052 --> 00:41:06,766
And... I promise not to get
in the way of other

373
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,678
all good work you're doing
around here.

374
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,444
Oh. I trust you won't.

375
00:41:11,798 --> 00:41:15,811
Do it inspector,
and God will be with you.

376
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:10,933
Hello?

377
00:42:39,002 --> 00:42:39,668
Hello?

378
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:24,202
What?
What the hell?

379
00:44:55,448 --> 00:44:57,444
Goodbye, inspector.

380
00:45:07,129 --> 00:45:07,999
¿Hello?

381
00:45:08,252 --> 00:45:09,535
Larissa, there is it me.

382
00:45:09,884 --> 00:45:12,550
Dick, I told you not to call me here.
You can get me past it.

383
00:45:12,775 --> 00:45:14,365
I had to. I think something's
happened

384
00:45:14,465 --> 00:45:15,777
<i>to inspector Hinds.</i>

385
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:18,523
That asshole?
Why should I care about him?

386
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:20,500
Listen. I found some noted fix.

387
00:45:20,564 --> 00:45:23,637
Apparently notes the girls been reported missing
from the halfway house.

388
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:24,643
I know.

389
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:26,999
You do? What happened?

390
00:45:28,383 --> 00:45:29,870
I don't know. She just disappeared.

391
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:31,487
Now we want to talk about anything

392
00:45:31,487 --> 00:45:32,216
<i>around here.</i>

393
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:34,562
Well. I think the Inspector were there
to investigate.

394
00:45:34,563 --> 00:45:35,730
<i>Have you seen him?</i>

395
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:36,770
No.

396
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,894
<i>??? investigate this morning</i>

397
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,097
???  call them. This is unlike.

398
00:45:40,132 --> 00:45:42,068
What you find out about the rest of staff?

399
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,792
I did some checking into Father Fogerty.
So far is clean.

400
00:45:46,102 --> 00:45:47,545
<i>That's my own opinion.</i>

401
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,608
What about Sister Cecilia
and the handyman?

402
00:45:50,671 --> 00:45:52,055
After all with him use wearing

403
00:45:52,355 --> 00:45:53,313
<i>my sisters headphones.</i>

404
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:54,947
I'm working on it.

405
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:57,361
Remember, I'm doing all this
unofficially.

406
00:45:58,315 --> 00:46:01,422
I gotta go. And wait for me
to call you next time.

407
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,142
What's the matter?

408
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,159
Not so cocky without that big dike
to protect you.

409
00:46:11,194 --> 00:46:14,891
-What do you want from me?
-We wanna get even with you.

410
00:46:14,892 --> 00:46:15,969
So, what?

411
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:17,649
We lost our privileges.

412
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,109
Yeah. And the desserts.

413
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:24,388
-Bu... But why is that my fault?
- Listen to little Miss Inocence.

414
00:46:25,108 --> 00:46:28,913
-Where's your last girlfriend gone?
-???

415
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,539
If you insist. Hold her down!

416
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:42,772
Oh! She's not in there.
Where else could you be hiding here?

417
00:46:46,446 --> 00:46:51,100
Well, well, well.
I know why they call her Cherry.

418
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:56,129
-Is there  ???.
-She doesn't know what she's missing.

419
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,750
Hey. Why don't we show her.

420
00:46:59,592 --> 00:47:04,359
That's a good idea. Hold her tighter.
This cherry is a bad to get bad.

421
00:47:07,701 --> 00:47:09,226
Look what I found!

422
00:47:09,456 --> 00:47:11,570
Wow. Economy size.

423
00:47:11,727 --> 00:47:14,665
Hey Cherry. Would you like a date
with Madonna!

424
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,268
Madonna! The singer?
You know her?

425
00:47:18,146 --> 00:47:20,123
Not that Madonna, stupid!

426
00:47:37,986 --> 00:47:41,780
Open wide, she comes ...

427
00:47:46,758 --> 00:47:48,611
That's no way
to treat a virgin.

428
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:51,798
-What the fuck are you here?
-Yeah, this is not your bussiness.

429
00:47:51,811 --> 00:47:54,056
Maybe it should make
my bussiness.

430
00:47:56,365 --> 00:48:00,398
No! The bitch is mine.
Watch the door.

431
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,413
I'd like to taste
your blood.

432
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,677
Maybe you can tell me
when you're done.

433
00:48:12,737 --> 00:48:14,439
Come on! Come on!

434
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,827
Hit the ??? Angelina.
Hit the ???.

435
00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:26,265
Quiet. Father Fogerty is coming.

436
00:48:36,896 --> 00:48:37,860
Okay, he's gone.

437
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,334
???!
He's coming back.

438
00:49:00,385 --> 00:49:01,750
Okey. It's clear.

439
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:39,803
They... They... They tried ...

440
00:49:40,974 --> 00:49:44,005
It's okey. It's okey.
I'm being right now.

441
00:49:46,457 --> 00:49:48,064
You saved to me.

442
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:52,337
I do not know how
I repay you.

443
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,430
What are you doing?

444
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:17,838
All these,
these must've been mixed up in my lock.

445
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:19,242
I wanna hear it.

446
00:50:19,747 --> 00:50:23,966
It's after dark. Time
to get rid of that detective corp.

447
00:50:24,497 --> 00:50:25,616
Yes, Mistress.

448
00:50:27,908 --> 00:50:34,146
I want you to take it
as far away as possible.  Understand?

449
00:50:36,873 --> 00:50:37,772
Good.

450
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:57,173
Will you keep it down?

451
00:50:57,733 --> 00:50:59,725
What's the matter, Angelina?
You got a headache?

452
00:50:59,786 --> 00:51:01,622
No, she is ???.

453
00:51:01,657 --> 00:51:03,142
Cause you got a asked it.

454
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:06,031
Yeah, I guess is not that
instead she thought she was.

455
00:51:05,922 --> 00:51:08,104
I can't still look forward
but the two of you.

456
00:51:08,215 --> 00:51:09,382
Yeah, you're right.

457
00:51:09,999 --> 00:51:13,658
State so, or maybe I need
to get myself new home girls.

458
00:51:14,195 --> 00:51:16,386
You couldn't find everyone
that wants the job.

459
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:18,474
Fuck the both of you!

460
00:51:18,767 --> 00:51:20,948
I have very things to do
than sit around with you two ???.

461
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:24,044
I may find my real man.

462
00:51:51,882 --> 00:51:54,750
Geez, Spider!
What's the fuch with you?

463
00:51:58,993 --> 00:52:02,497
Action crash, sweet cheeks.
I'm fam practice.

464
00:52:02,672 --> 00:52:06,669
You're practicing as if you play?
There's came out around it.

465
00:52:06,533 --> 00:52:10,550
Very funny. If you hate it so bad
why did you come down?

466
00:52:11,605 --> 00:52:14,572
Forget it.
Should get out here.

467
00:52:15,005 --> 00:52:16,532
But you go wrong back.

468
00:52:16,877 --> 00:52:19,413
You promised to take me away
from this fucking shithole.

469
00:52:19,623 --> 00:52:21,174
-You has gas money?
-No.

470
00:52:21,188 --> 00:52:23,271
Alright then. Parking back.

471
00:52:25,055 --> 00:52:26,564

-Sexy.

00:52:48,438 --> 00:52:50,972
Could you at least park further

That's real sweet talk Mr. Smooth.

477
00:53:07,282 --> 00:53:12,647
Okey. Okey. Please...

00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,145
Okey.

Come on. Do it. Do it.

483
00:53:41,715 --> 00:53:45,356
-Hey! What happened to your eye?
-Shut up then fuck.

484
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,905
Right. Do it.

485
00:53:52,891 --> 00:53:54,235
Do it. Do it.

486
00:53:56,049 --> 00:53:56,909
Oh, yeah.

487
00:53:57,312 --> 00:53:58,299
Don't you ???

488
00:53:59,933 --> 00:54:03,794
-Why are you stopping?
-I thought I heard something.

489
00:54:04,702 --> 00:54:07,277
You can hear me get mad
from now this ???  if not again.

490
00:54:08,823 --> 00:54:10,603
Okey. Okey.

491
00:54:15,032 --> 00:54:22,719
That's it. Don't... Don't...
Ah... Ah... Ah...

492
00:54:22,754 --> 00:54:24,188
Don't stop it!

493
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,689
-I'm not stopping.
-Don't! Don't!

494
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:46,186
Well. I knew you'd end up here
sooner or later.

495
00:54:46,268 --> 00:54:48,079
You people are fucking in sick!

496
00:54:48,353 --> 00:54:54,316
-Ah, ah. Language dear.
-That beast cut off his head!

497
00:54:54,871 --> 00:55:00,363
Oh. Your late friend? His head was in serving
any purpose where was.

498
00:55:00,855 --> 00:55:04,161
Now you too have
a glorious future in store.

499
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,046
What do you fucking talking about?

500
00:55:06,396 --> 00:55:08,421
You will be food for our God.

501
00:55:08,928 --> 00:55:13,107
Your flesh will provide sustenance
for a being fastly superior to you.

502
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:20,353
Yes! It's an honor that
you die for it. Go.

503
00:57:00,635 --> 00:57:03,543
If there any more runaways
will have to put him on a diet.

504
00:57:09,185 --> 00:57:13,152
I called you all here today
to pray ...

505
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:16,884
for our missing daughters.

506
00:57:21,687 --> 00:57:23,784
Two runaways
in two days?

507
00:57:24,956 --> 00:57:27,438
That makes...
one a day!

508
00:57:28,648 --> 00:57:30,973
At this rate will be empty
in a couple of weeks!

509
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:36,286
No. I can not believe that ??? one of
you do not know something about all of this!

510
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,444
First Edwin disappears.

511
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:47,499
Then Angelina runs off the following
night to join her.

512
00:57:47,817 --> 00:57:49,544
What the fuck hated each other!

513
00:57:51,497 --> 00:57:52,580
Excuse me?

514
00:57:55,094 --> 00:57:59,704
-Nothing Father.
-Oh no, no, no. Apart from the profanity...

515
00:58:00,209 --> 00:58:03,493
I distinctly heard you say
something about the missing girls.

516
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,936
All she meant was...

517
00:58:05,175 --> 00:58:06,135
Yes.

518
00:58:06,994 --> 00:58:10,039
Angelina and Edwin didn't get a loan.
That's all.

519
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:12,608
They never would run away together.

520
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:20,434
Really? Well!  It seems that you two
know a great deal about all of this.

521
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:27,461
You two ...  My office,
now. Carrie on, Sister.

522
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:39,118
Everyone, please rise
and ??? sing. Holly, holly, holly...

523
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:33,872
Oh Lord, we humbly beseech thee
to show these sinners...

524
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:38,437
the truth is the only
way to redemption.

525
00:59:41,558 --> 00:59:43,850
Now! Repeat after me.

526
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:46,542
The power of Christ
compels me.

527
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:48,942
The power of Christ
compels me.

528
00:59:50,189 --> 00:59:51,056
Now you.

529
00:59:51,459 --> 00:59:53,489
The power of Christ
compels me.

530
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:06,458
The power of Christ
compels me.

531
01:00:09,078 --> 01:00:11,613
The power of Christ
compels me.

532
01:00:24,043 --> 01:00:25,029
Both together.

533
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:27,607
The power of Christ
compels me.

534
01:00:27,908 --> 01:00:30,219
The power of Christ
compels me.

535
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:33,168
The power of Christ
compels me.

536
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:35,251
The power of Christ
compels me.

537
01:00:35,926 --> 01:00:38,212
The power of Christ
compels me.

538
01:00:40,441 --> 01:00:43,923
<i> Yes, I know about the other
desappearance. We have a call this morning.</i>

539
01:00:43,924 --> 01:00:45,491
<i>Have you find out anything?</i>

540
01:00:46,035 --> 01:00:48,201
No. Nothing yet.
How of you?

541
01:00:48,498 --> 01:00:50,289
<i>I came up with a ???
interesting stuff </i>

542
01:00:50,487 --> 01:00:52,975
<i>about Sister Cecilia and
her creepy friend.</i>

543
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,361
<i>??? there just for an hour?</i>

544
01:00:55,396 --> 01:00:58,892
-What day is this?
-Wednesday. Why?

545
01:01:47,907 --> 01:01:50,187
I can't be gone for long.
What did you find?

546
01:01:50,543 --> 01:01:54,047
All things are Sister Cecilia has led
a pretty typical life for a nun ...

547
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:55,999
until about 3 years ago.

548
01:01:56,093 --> 01:01:58,964
-What happened then?
-She was teaching in an all-boys school

549
01:01:59,211 --> 01:02:01,474
when she was gang-raped
for some of her students.

550
01:02:01,923 --> 01:02:03,230
13 about.

551
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:06,001
-Unlucky.
-It gets better.

552
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:09,560
Genuine psychiatric testing was ordered
to take a leave of absence.

553
01:02:10,073 --> 01:02:13,594
She went on a training at Massachusetts
spending a lot of her time

554
01:02:13,914 --> 01:02:15,904
on  a library Misketonik University.

555
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:19,779
Misketonik. Why that sound
familiar?

556
01:02:20,391 --> 01:02:23,604
I don't know. But who
was working there at the same time?

557
01:02:24,571 --> 01:02:25,568
The handyman.

558
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:29,546
That's right. When Charles Dexter ???
his working like a janitor.

559
01:02:30,829 --> 01:02:34,005
That's great, but still doesn't explain why.

560
01:02:34,024 --> 01:02:37,943
On this one other thing.
Shortly before they left Massachusetts

561
01:02:38,015 --> 01:02:40,047
a rare book was stolen
from the University Library.

562
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:44,582
-A book. So what?
-This book is called the Necronomicon.

563
01:02:44,652 --> 01:02:47,159
It was believed to contain
mystical spells of power.

564
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:50,414
The professors there say that only
are one copy in existence.

565
01:02:51,449 --> 01:02:54,616
I see you think Sister Cecilia
is practicing black magic.

566
01:02:55,015 --> 01:02:56,745
What next? Human sacrifices?

567
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:02,588
-I know it's a wacky idea but...
-Wich sure explains a lot.

568
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:05,015
I gotta go back.

569
01:03:05,712 --> 01:03:09,191
Wait a minute. If it's all true
you can be in serious danger.

570
01:03:09,408 --> 01:03:11,874
I gotta go back.
Cherry might me mind.

571
01:03:11,981 --> 01:03:12,379
Who?

572
01:03:12,695 --> 01:03:16,228
Nevermind. Find out what you can
about "Necro watch me call it"

573
01:03:16,368 --> 01:03:17,877
may that give us a few more answers.

574
01:03:17,912 --> 01:03:19,673
-But...
-I'll call you in a couple hours.

575
01:03:19,674 --> 01:03:22,432
Okey.

576
01:03:53,227 --> 01:03:56,606
Where were you?
Answer me. Where were you?

577
01:03:56,641 --> 01:03:59,140
-I was in the yard.
-You were outside alright.

578
01:03:59,175 --> 01:04:00,408
You were outside the grounds.

579
01:04:00,581 --> 01:04:01,614
But I wasn't.

580
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:04,166
Don't make it worse on yourself
by lying.

581
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:08,966
And what pray tell was this
doing in your room.

582
01:04:10,145 --> 01:04:13,292
I was afraid I was going to have to report
another missing call to the police!

583
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:16,871
I didn't run away.
I just snuck out for a while.

584
01:04:16,872 --> 01:04:18,967
That still doesn't tell me
where you went.

585
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:20,576
I don't wanna say.

586
01:04:22,623 --> 01:04:24,488
Probably ran off
to meet up with some boy ...

587
01:04:24,792 --> 01:04:25,608
That's not true.

588
01:04:25,687 --> 01:04:28,028
to engage in sinful carnal pleasures.

589
01:04:28,063 --> 01:04:30,517
-Father, you've got it all wrong.
-Silence!

590
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:33,348
It doesn't matter why you left the grounds.

591
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:39,174
The fact that you did it is a serious infraction
and must therefore be punished.

592
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:42,119
Wait, please.
You've gotta listen to me.

593
01:04:42,328 --> 01:04:44,660
Something terrible
is going on around here

594
01:04:44,661 --> 01:04:46,668
and Sister Cecilia is at the ???.

595
01:04:47,334 --> 01:04:48,880
Sister Cecilia!

596
01:04:49,168 --> 01:04:51,518
Yes. I know it seems hard
to understand but...

597
01:04:53,551 --> 01:04:56,017
she's not ???
She is very ??? (too stir).

598
01:04:56,415 --> 01:04:58,341
It's more can really.

599
01:04:58,376 --> 01:05:01,301
Yes. It's true. Her
and her handyman ...

600
01:05:01,336 --> 01:05:05,164
are practicing things against
God and the Catholic Church.

601
01:05:05,937 --> 01:05:09,336
I see. So now the handyman is
involved in this as well.

602
01:05:09,784 --> 01:05:13,201
Yes Father. It's true
and you gotta do something about it.

603
01:05:13,236 --> 01:05:15,758
Oh. I intend to.

604
01:05:18,343 --> 01:05:25,077
Now, kinda leaning against the desk
and repeat after me.

605
01:05:33,685 --> 01:05:36,797
-Larissa.
-Cherry, gotta help me.

606
01:05:37,007 --> 01:05:37,820
What happened you?

607
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:43,324
I just 110 rounds of father fuck end
is wholly ??? this ???.

608
01:05:43,605 --> 01:05:44,373
Sit down.

609
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:46,934
I don't think be
sitting for a while.

610
01:05:48,976 --> 01:05:53,227
Listen Cherry...
I gotta tell you something.

611
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:57,193
-I'm not like the others girls here.
-I know you're not.

612
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:03,058
No. I do not mean that.
I'm here undercover.

613
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:05,322
You're some kind of cop?

614
01:06:05,701 --> 01:06:08,652
No. No. But I'm working with one.

615
01:06:08,895 --> 01:06:11,081
In trying to find out what
happened to my sister.

616
01:06:11,557 --> 01:06:13,915
I think there's a connection
between her disappearance

617
01:06:13,916 --> 01:06:15,009
and those what happen here.

618
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:16,717
You mean my ???

619
01:06:17,563 --> 01:06:19,094
I thought she just ran away.

620
01:06:19,473 --> 01:06:23,667
I think that Sister Cecilia and handyman
have something to do with all this.

621
01:06:24,058 --> 01:06:26,832
-Can I do the help?
-I need to search her room.

622
01:06:26,994 --> 01:06:32,465
And I want you stand watch.
I don't want they catch at the end.

623
01:06:41,259 --> 01:06:45,608
-Pretty smooth you picked up lock.
-Just one of my many talents.

624
01:06:48,275 --> 01:06:49,235
Save it for later.

625
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:54,590
Okey.

626
01:07:21,733 --> 01:07:22,607
It's gone.

627
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:23,823
What is?

628
01:07:24,783 --> 01:07:29,312
There used to be a cross in here.
I wonder when she ???.

629
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,342
Open awful in
the head of ??? bitch.

630
01:07:31,928 --> 01:07:33,292
??? looking that way.

631
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:49,175
Jesus Christ.

632
01:08:06,959 --> 01:08:07,929
<i>Hello. Larissa?</i>

633
01:08:08,202 --> 01:08:13,081
<i>It's me. I found much more
stuff about the Necronomicon book.</i>

634
01:08:14,205 --> 01:08:15,718
<i>Hello. Are you there?</i>

635
01:08:18,246 --> 01:08:20,351
<i>Larissa. What is coming out?</i>

636
01:08:22,147 --> 01:08:25,378
Hello.
Hello!

637
01:08:42,861 --> 01:08:43,972
This is it.

638
01:08:53,549 --> 01:08:55,852
-Somebody is coming.
-Who is it?

639
01:08:57,156 --> 01:08:58,944
It is...
Sister Cecilia!

640
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:01,957
I'm sorry I'm not a good look out.
I'll try it better next time.

641
01:09:01,975 --> 01:09:03,369
There won't be a next time.

642
01:09:03,379 --> 01:09:05,009
Hand over that book,
Miss Morgan.

643
01:09:05,265 --> 01:09:06,632
Hand it over, please.

644
01:09:06,771 --> 01:09:10,965
Look. I don't know what you're doing with it,
but I'm not the only one who knows about it.

645
01:09:11,222 --> 01:09:17,122
Oh, yes. Your friend, the young sergeant.
I expect that he'll be here looking for you.

646
01:09:17,157 --> 01:09:19,388
It's a pity that
he's never gonna to find.

647
01:09:20,053 --> 01:09:21,423
Larissa!

648
01:09:26,545 --> 01:09:30,167
-There will be two tonight?
-No. Not this one.

649
01:09:30,593 --> 01:09:33,930
She must be found far away from here
and must look like an accident.

650
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:36,020
I don't want to raise
any more suspicions.

651
01:09:36,045 --> 01:09:38,492
-What will you do with me?
-You, my dear?

652
01:09:38,937 --> 01:09:40,600
I'm going to invite you to the dinner.

653
01:09:40,911 --> 01:09:43,028
Do you me?
What are we having?

654
01:09:55,807 --> 01:09:59,449
It won't be long now. As soon as
Lutkus stays care for your friend.

655
01:09:59,518 --> 01:10:00,690
It will be up your turn.

656
01:10:02,075 --> 01:10:05,839
Sister Cecilia.
You look different.

657
01:10:08,259 --> 01:10:10,551
Oh. I hope this idiot
doesn't take all night.

658
01:10:18,473 --> 01:10:19,169
What?

659
01:10:22,122 --> 01:10:24,186
-Are you okay?
-I'm living.

660
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:27,016
You were right about the Sister
Cecilia and book.

661
01:10:27,263 --> 01:10:27,946
Shit!

662
01:10:28,598 --> 01:10:32,421
College my research the Necronomicon
holds the secrets to bring back the Old Ones.

663
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:33,575
The Old Ones?

664
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,501
There is a race of monsters ???.

665
01:10:36,384 --> 01:10:38,134
And was ruled the planet
before men.

666
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:40,369
Supposedly they chat in
other dimension now

667
01:10:40,651 --> 01:10:43,229
By performing rituals that are described
in that book.

668
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:46,812
A gate will be open and
he'll be able to reenter our world.

669
01:10:46,914 --> 01:10:47,766
What happen us?

670
01:10:48,613 --> 01:10:50,019
We'll be destroyed.

671
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:52,402
We must stop them.

672
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,608
-Where is she now?
-I don't know.

673
01:10:54,957 --> 01:10:56,710
But I know someone who does.

674
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:02,317
Where is Sister Cecilia?

675
01:11:03,005 --> 01:11:04,737
??? I tell you.

676
01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:07,044
I don't know.

677
01:11:08,548 --> 01:11:09,239
Okey.

678
01:11:11,424 --> 01:11:13,619
-Down here.
-That's biggest.

679
01:11:16,754 --> 01:11:18,379
My shoelaces untied.

680
01:11:25,873 --> 01:11:30,526
I can't believe that ???
should it ???.

681
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:30,826
All this time ...

682
01:12:32,984 --> 01:12:35,539
I was trying to protect you
not to get hurt.

683
01:12:38,075 --> 01:12:40,485
I'll call for help.

684
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:44,415
It isn't time for that.

685
01:12:46,337 --> 01:12:47,597
You could stop ...

686
01:13:04,999 --> 01:13:06,266
I'm sorry...

687
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:14,872
Get away from her, you bitch!

688
01:13:15,405 --> 01:13:17,951
Larissa. You came for me!

689
01:13:18,201 --> 01:13:21,136
What the fuck can ???
is going on here?

690
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:26,087
Since you're so persistent
I believe I'll tell you.

691
01:13:26,923 --> 01:13:31,527
Beyond that door,
life the ??? god of a new age ...

692
01:13:31,818 --> 01:13:36,069
An age where man will be replace
as dominant species of the planet.

693
01:13:36,994 --> 01:13:39,168
Why the hell would you want to
do that?

694
01:13:39,436 --> 01:13:43,529
Because man is
a ??? vulgar creature

695
01:13:43,626 --> 01:13:48,731
ruled by his own lust. He is not fit
to even touch the sanctity that is a woman.

696
01:13:49,013 --> 01:13:51,541
I put myself above such
animal passions.

697
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:54,142
But that wasn't enough.

698
01:13:54,516 --> 01:13:59,684
I was raped, defiled by the very impure creatures
that the church told me to love.

699
01:14:00,217 --> 01:14:04,787
But then I found a truer,
older faith.

700
01:14:05,498 --> 01:14:10,075
A believe that the permanent
humanity could be purged

701
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:12,220
by a superior race.

702
01:14:13,004 --> 01:14:17,180
Well, I heard that before. And just,
how are you going to accomplish all this?

703
01:14:17,238 --> 01:14:20,071
I unrevealed the secrets
of the Necronomicon ...

704
01:14:20,438 --> 01:14:24,745
and I have brought forth a being that
will father a new world

705
01:14:25,141 --> 01:14:28,382
and I will be its mother.

706
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,279
You mean you plan on fucking
some monster from beyond

707
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,441
and having its children?

708
01:14:34,867 --> 01:14:36,853
You're lot sicker
than I thought.

709
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:42,818
I have committed my body
to the future ruler of the planet.

710
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,785
And what about my sister? And the others?
What happened to them?

711
01:14:45,873 --> 01:14:50,631
Nourishment. He needed to eat
to build his strength ...

712
01:14:50,696 --> 01:14:53,950
to bridge the gap
between his world than ours.

713
01:14:54,352 --> 01:14:57,369
Even the future ruler of the planet
needs to eat.

714
01:14:57,838 --> 01:15:00,111
I've heard enough of this ???!

715
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:05,201
Sister Cecilia, I am then shocked
with what I've seen here.

716
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:11,236
First, by finding you allowed these girls
to leave the rooms after lights shut.

717
01:15:11,838 --> 01:15:17,915
Second, I have heard your spanding believes
contrary the Holy Mother Church.

718
01:15:17,961 --> 01:15:21,927
And third, you're out your uniform!

719
01:15:22,407 --> 01:15:28,064
I could not expect your puny mind
to grass much less embrace your future.

720
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:39,142
Enough for me! I cast you out!

721
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:44,733
What in name of God
is that?

722
01:15:45,252 --> 01:15:47,825
Oh that. That's your destiny ...

723
01:15:48,227 --> 01:15:51,915
Your and all the other pet bedding
doomed members of your race.

724
01:15:51,999 --> 01:15:54,091
In nomini Patris et Filii et Spiritus...

725
01:16:19,914 --> 01:16:21,878
Well done. That's finished.

726
01:16:36,127 --> 01:16:38,327
You're not ???

727
01:16:38,506 --> 01:16:40,820
Yeah, I can and I will.

728
01:16:43,888 --> 01:16:45,814
You think your religion
is any better?

729
01:16:46,104 --> 01:16:49,509
Sure. But your neighbors ???
you too.

730
01:16:53,937 --> 01:16:58,057
Condemns the Church because
these guys ???

731
01:17:01,176 --> 01:17:06,884
The Church near I have to demand again.
I've got my plan on eliminating them.

732
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:09,083
You must
go through me first.

733
01:17:53,884 --> 01:17:55,204
No! No! I'm your wife!

734
01:18:05,134 --> 01:18:06,642
Look that
???.

735
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:31,068
Stop! Stop!

736
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,123
-Let's go out here.
-No, not yet. I gonna finish it.

737
01:18:58,036 --> 01:18:59,825
???
Son of bitch!

738
01:19:12,493 --> 01:19:14,900
You did it!
You saved me again.

739
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:28,089
Let's get hell out of here.

740
01:20:29,134 --> 01:20:38,180
