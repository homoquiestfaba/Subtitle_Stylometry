00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:09,510
BIKINI SPRING BREAK

2
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,612
Hee, girls!

3
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:17,872
- Soon it will be our turn.
- If we win, we get to compete nationally.

4
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:23,790
Then maybe we can march on the
big Thanksgiving parade and then...

5
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:31,426
Okay, Ramirez.
Remember there are steps, stop, step.

6
00:01:31,544 --> 00:01:34,972
Do not stop, stop,
poke in the nose, step, okay?

7
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:40,392
It is the same routine as we did
all season. You can do it.

8
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,060
Are you sure, Coach Gil?

9
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:45,516
Yes, because the judge this year
lower the standards.

10
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:49,153
- Yes! We will win.
- Ya?

11
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,986
Zoe, front center.

12
00:01:55,568 --> 00:02:00,123
- Do I made take a picture?
- No, you are the most geeky here...

13
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:07,250
... So you know what to do.
The headmaster wants to live march.

14
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:11,463
Use or don't use,
I don't give a shit. Listen...

15
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:15,676
you guys, least at twenty minutes
without embaracing yourselves.

16
00:02:15,796 --> 00:02:18,809
- So it can change our lives?
- Sure.

17
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:22,720
- Should I put it on my euphonium?
- You what you figured up.

18
00:02:22,844 --> 00:02:27,234
- We set up nine minutes.
- Nine minutes? Jesus...

19
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,529
- What does he want?
- To change our lives forever.

20
00:02:32,646 --> 00:02:34,899
Cool.

21
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:41,990
- Rector Hanio, looking sharp.
- Do I know you?

22
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:45,661
- Alice was going to the regionals.
- Alyson, yes.

23
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:51,039
Alice. Do you think she
hits some guys in Florida?

24
00:02:51,164 --> 00:02:57,012
- Boys? What do you mean?
- Spring break. super hot guys. Muscles...

25
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:59,975
Alyson?
Should be fine, your sister.

26
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:04,680
- Girlfriend.
- Girlfriend? We'll all be safe, ok?

27
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:08,353
- I'm going to sit down.
- Absolutely!

28
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:11,059
- See you on National.
- I doubt it.

29
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:31,954
Wait, did you hear that?

30
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:42,264
They can hardly wait. They love us.

31
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:47,053
- Of course.
- Zoe!

32
00:03:48,636 --> 00:03:51,816
- Alice.
- Hi.

33
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:59,775
- Do they look okay?
- Yes, check mine. What do you think?

34
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,750
Girls, wear now.
Clothing should be worn.

35
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:09,869
No!

36
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:19,720
- You have some hair there.
- I shave before I go out.

37
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:24,509
If we win today, we will
to national competition

38
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:29,305
- In Florida.
- I've never been there.

39
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:36,650
We're going to Florida!

40
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:41,321
Boobs! Boobs! Boobs!

41
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:48,787
- We're going to the national competition!
- Boobs!

42
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:55,835
- We're going to the national competition.
- Get the hell dress!

43
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:58,373
Okay.

44
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:02,009
- I'm so proud of you.
- And I'm proud of you.

45
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:14,889
I'm sure that we win.
My grandmother had to compete national.

46
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:20,364
- My mom also.
- And now I feel I will also follow suit.

47
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:28,117
I'm not going to say it again.
Give dress now!

48
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:30,619
No!

49
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,786
Girls, why are not you dressed?
Time for a formation. Hurry up.

50
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:40,627
Man in the locker room!

51
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:44,793
Turn off the camera!
They can see everything.

52
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:51,716
Oh my God!

53
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:59,475
How do I turn it off?

54
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:05,232
This is, you, the audience seen,
Breast wobbling...

55
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:08,118
in my office.

56
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:12,455
Girls, we can learn that
we must stay away from drugs.

57
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:15,500
Form a formation, ready in a minute.

58
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:18,908
Give dress!

59
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:20,352
Coach Gil.

60
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:24,590
- You and the...
- Band?

61
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:29,796
- Band? The tape and...
- Camcorder.

62
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,979
We made a stupid mistake. Everyone makes her
own easy to laugh, but no one was injured.

63
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:41,602
- That's not true.
- They do not have a chance.

64
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:48,652
They can not even regional contest.
Oh god... You and I need a drink.

65
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:53,947
- Sit down.
- No, I'll have a drink...

66
00:06:54,068 --> 00:06:56,223
...And pretend that
life has value.

67
00:06:56,224 --> 00:06:59,241
Gil. I can not believe
I'm going to say this.

68
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:02,794
- You're going to the national competition.
- I'm going to get drunk.

69
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:07,217
- We are pathetic!
- Yes, but that does not matter. Sit.

70
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:18,761
- What did he say?
- If you are ruined for me, Zoe...

71
00:07:18,884 --> 00:07:22,017
- Me?
- I'm here on scholarship.

72
00:07:22,138 --> 00:07:25,270
- Scholarship? Can you get this?
- Yes.

73
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:33,239
we will come to the national competition.

74
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:44,120
It's time.

75
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:47,174
Where the hell bus,
Coach Gil?

76
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,758
It's too late. The
bus was always like this.

77
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:54,589
- Are you okay, Snoopy rabbit?
- Poo Bear.

78
00:07:54,669 --> 00:08:01,515
I'll be in Florida, although
This Spring break. It's not my style.

79
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:06,439
and also, I know that you will
along with your good friend, Hank.

80
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:12,986
Yes, but anyway...
If you want to play in a porn video...

81
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:17,115
What? I do not want to record
some porn video. Do you?

82
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:19,997
- No, you know that I'm pretty...
- Small.

83
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:23,041
- No, no...
- Very small.

84
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:28,044
It's easy. We have drumstick
I use on you.

85
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:31,423
- In addition to large...
- I compensate well for it?

86
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:36,214
Not directly, but it does not. I
promises to only record movies with you.

87
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:42,351
we can use the camcorder mother,
and then it does not look a bit. Okay?

88
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:45,266
- I'll miss you.
- Me too.

89
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:50,852
- Michelle, what happened?
- I missed my fucking plane.

90
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:55,696
- My fucking mom never stopped talking.
- Your home sounds wonderful.

91
00:08:55,812 --> 00:09:00,867
- What do you mean by that?
- Relax, girls. Gather stuff.

92
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:04,615
- Be careful.
- It's just a euphonium.

93
00:09:04,697 --> 00:09:06,183
No, it's Charlie.

94
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:10,379
The only memory I have
left of my grandmother.

95
00:09:10,494 --> 00:09:16,461
Sorry. You may have to hang it on the wall,
and think about masturbation?

96
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:19,921
I might have to think about you.

97
00:09:21,963 --> 00:09:27,847
I'm a little nervous.
I never drive like a big bus...

98
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:34,067
It's like a car. D for advanced
R for reverse and P for parking.

99
00:09:34,184 --> 00:09:38,147
- It is important that I do not...
- I believe you, dear.

100
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:40,739
Do not rush, a good idea.

101
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:47,455
- Are we ready to ride on the bus?
- All instruments are numbered...

102
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:54,168
Zoe... but should fly with the others.
It is entirely in the car and she is tough.

103
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:56,332
No, I can not leave Charlie.

104
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,673
You know, Zoe, you really do
have an natural relationship...

105
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:03,754
- ... To the instrument is properly strange?
- No, he was my grandma's.

106
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:12,600
I stand by it. See you in Miami
within two days. find out about that.

107
00:10:12,722 --> 00:10:15,818
Why does the ass here?

108
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:17,558
You could take the plane
with the other girls.

109
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:21,188
Are you kidding me?
And breathe the recycle air?

110
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:26,575
- Do you know how dangerous it is?
- Whitney, you're in charge.

111
00:10:26,652 --> 00:10:30,116
- Of course, I'm.
- Hey coach.

112
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:36,870
- Do we have chance with the nationals?
- No, but you can do well.

113
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:39,078
See you in Florida,
drive carefully.

114
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:42,908
We're be fine.

115
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:52,267
Really? A school bus?
Let's go, retards.

116
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:09,748
- Why Coach Gil like that?
- He's on medication.

117
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:15,038
- No, he's trying to motivate us.
- This is the opposite of motivation.

118
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:20,545
- I'm motivated. I read about it.
- It's called a reverse emocion empathy.

119
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,678
He wants to force us to succeed by
break us down. It's a brilliant idea.

120
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:32,014
- It's called psychological abuse.
- Our coach is a drunk...

121
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:36,641
- ... But we won anyway, right?
- Yes.

122
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:55,675
Zoe! Plays she really now?

123
00:12:55,798 --> 00:12:59,429
Place of hell!
We are trying to sleep.

124
00:12:59,552 --> 00:13:04,986
Stop fucking playing, Zoe! I drive
up your ass on you. Bring it here.

125
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:08,611
I trying to practice.
I had to do it perfect.

126
00:13:12,106 --> 00:13:14,111
Zoe!

127
00:13:24,035 --> 00:13:26,584
We take a break on five minutes.

128
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:32,336
Hey, Coach Gil.

129
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:35,677
Yes, we just think to refuel...

130
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:41,518
Whose clarinet?
Karen, that dumbass. Ok.

131
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:45,775
Can you fill up the tank?
I have to look for one thing.

132
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:52,488
Hey! Will you hem Spring break?

133
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:58,033
- Spring... what?
- We may be seen down there.

134
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:05,580
Take part in a wet t-shirt contest.
I'm curious on what you have down there.

135
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:11,296
- No.
- Okay, it's too bad.

136
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:14,594
- See you.
- Okay...

137
00:14:37,231 --> 00:14:39,201
A sign against Miami!

138
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:48,294
Ready? Beat the drum,
beat, at the drums!

139
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:54,625
Beat the drum., beat the drum.
Play the flute, play, play the flute.

140
00:14:54,748 --> 00:14:58,212
Play the flute, play,
play the flute.

141
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:04,635
Marching with the band,
marching, marching band!

142
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:08,981
Win the Nationals, win,
win the Nationals!

143
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:13,984
Girls! You do realize? We
have over 200 miles to go?

144
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,609
200 longs miles.

145
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:22,869
- Win the Nationals, win, win the Nationals!
- Jesus...

146
00:15:22,984 --> 00:15:27,161
The smoke from the hood!
This bus will be broken.

147
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:57,485
Calm down! I'm staying!
Jesus...

148
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:07,154
- What the hell did you do?
- Did you drive on anyone?

149
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:12,331
- My uncle did it once.
- No, there is something wrong with the bus.

150
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:17,841
Girls... Charlie's ok.

151
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:24,093
- Everything is gonna be ok.
- Shut up with your stupid euphonium.

152
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:26,465
How can we get to Miami?

153
00:16:27,548 --> 00:16:30,098
We can take the bus!

154
00:16:30,216 --> 00:16:35,188
- Morron. Somebody call a truck.
- Right...

155
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:43,483
- What are you looking for?
- What do you think?

156
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:45,865
About what?

157
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:52,575
No idea. He checked under the hood
in the fifteen minutes. What should I do?

158
00:16:52,697 --> 00:17:00,255
- We will not.
- What? No, we're just 80 miles away.

159
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:04,548
I think it's impossible, baby.

160
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:08,718
Relax, we'll be here in a day or two.

161
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:14,223
Wait a bit, he seems to be ready now.
I'll call you back.

162
00:17:17,263 --> 00:17:21,486
I'm not a mechanic,
but the problem is quite clear.

163
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:26,322
- Have someone poured gasoline on it?
- Zoe!

164
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:32,121
A bus must have a diesel!
The know anyone.

165
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:37,623
- We go to college, not a kindergarten.
- You put gasoline in a diesel tank?

166
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:44,123
- Damn!
- Sorry, but I never drive the bus.

167
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:50,092
I'm don't feel so good guys...
I'm really hot...

168
00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:54,269
- Is that Elvis?
- You look a little strange.

169
00:17:56,217 --> 00:18:01,023
- You should probably get a new engine.
- And how much it cost?

170
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,730
- Three or four perhaps.
- Hundred?

171
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:09,732
- Thousand.
- Three to four thousand? Hell.

172
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:14,163
Yes, and to find a mechanic in
weekend with Spring break and all...

173
00:18:14,278 --> 00:18:19,533
We have to go to Miami. our entire
band and our future depends on there.

174
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:23,044
Sorry ladies. I wish
I had better news for you.

175
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:26,957
You do realize what the reason
we're going to the Nationals?

176
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,258
what what? We do. We are buying an engine
and go to the national competition.

177
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,345
- Where we will get the money?
- Ask the Coach Gil.

178
00:18:36,466 --> 00:18:41,983
- It sucks!
- You killed the bus and our chances!

179
00:18:42,096 --> 00:18:45,394
You're killing my future
and my unborn children.

180
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:52,445
I will live in a hole with losers.
I'll kill myself!

181
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,866
Thank you, Zoe!

182
00:18:54,984 --> 00:18:59,788
- I'm sorry, I...
- Hello, my name is Constance.

183
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:04,544
- I do not care.
- Do you write on Spring break-ban?

184
00:19:04,618 --> 00:19:08,082
- Do you have four thousand for a new engine?
- No.

185
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:11,799
- So to hell with you.
- What is "forbidding breaker"?

186
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:16,722
- Prohibit Spring break.
- They have fun. Why ban it?

187
00:19:16,838 --> 00:19:20,600
- Is it possible?
- Yes, and I have my reasons.

188
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:24,223
- What did she mean?
- Girls,...

189
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:27,894
Wait a minute! I got you.

190
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:31,279
We go over here.

191
00:19:34,898 --> 00:19:38,576
- Franny?
- I feel hot.

192
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:43,664
I'm dizzy.
Is there a JV that catch me?

193
00:19:45,242 --> 00:19:49,963
Take her out of the sun over there.

194
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:56,295
Okay, come on. I got you.

195
00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:02,018
- You're doing enough.
- Wait! Fucking redneck!

196
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:05,602
What a gentleman.

197
00:20:05,678 --> 00:20:09,901
No! What's up with the bus?

198
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:14,441
- Take it easy.
- The National Competition!

199
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:20,363
- Chill down.
- The girls go to Florida. Understand?

200
00:20:21,652 --> 00:20:23,934
You exert yourself too much.

201
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,584
I do not care you're
married to my sister...

202
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,046
But...you get fired
if they do not come to Florida!

203
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:34,793
Remember that shit I gave you?
you should take a little more.

204
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:45,270
- What is this?
- Heat stroke. Get some water.

205
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:48,729
- Is she dead?
- No dead idiot.

206
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:51,693
- But he did not move.
- She was just a little sunstroke.

207
00:20:51,807 --> 00:20:56,563
Bullshit. Do you know where I am?
Listen. You're such a bitch!

208
00:20:56,687 --> 00:20:59,652
Take care of this.

209
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:06,745
- What? It works on TV.
- Can not you just die?

210
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:10,790
- Look, Zoe. You saved her.
- She did not at all.

211
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:15,251
- You can become a doctor.
- Can we learn? I get complex here.

212
00:21:15,372 --> 00:21:20,591
I should be on something fancy hotel,
not a grimy strip club!

213
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:26,601
Your hands dirty.
Do not touch me.

214
00:21:26,674 --> 00:21:28,929
Rub it all.

215
00:21:51,615 --> 00:21:56,336
Okay, I'll get someone
who can salvage your bus.

216
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:58,922
This is Gil.

217
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,885
- What did you say?
- We must perform without instruments.

218
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:10,264
- Is it possible?
- Ladies.

219
00:22:10,384 --> 00:22:13,309
You look like you need
something refreshing.

220
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,180
Delicious..

221
00:22:14,304 --> 00:22:17,437
- Remove it.
- A real sydstatskille.

222
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:20,192
Cooked in the south, jolly good.

223
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:25,067
- This replica is old as your mistress.
- You look familiar. Are you a porn actor?

224
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:30,577
As soon as the bus repaired, we draw
from this shit hole. Is that understood?

225
00:22:31,905 --> 00:22:35,915
Why is hot in here,
or is it just me?

226
00:22:40,997 --> 00:22:45,007
- Oh my God, I just got wet.
- You're all whores!

227
00:22:45,126 --> 00:22:48,804
- Focus.
- Focus on this.

228
00:22:48,922 --> 00:22:52,516
- Okay.
- I happened to hear a conversation.

229
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:57,024
- You can easy money in this town.
- Not a chance.

230
00:22:59,557 --> 00:23:01,776
you've got great potential.

231
00:24:18,634 --> 00:24:22,099
Although we had the engine
it would take a week to fix it.

232
00:24:22,222 --> 00:24:28,984
- You are only seven or nine hours away.
- We can take a bus to Miami.

233
00:24:30,104 --> 00:24:35,278
And leaving the instrument?
Do you would certainly sound better?

234
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:39,411
- We can send them.
- It's not the school can afford.

235
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:46,043
- If you are not insured?
- Not with nothing covering them here.

236
00:24:46,162 --> 00:24:50,421
- What should we do?
- Do you really do this?

237
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:55,927
- What do you mean?
- No, Okay, I'm driving up there.

238
00:24:57,173 --> 00:24:59,474
Fine.

239
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:11,654
- Wow. Observing that.
- Let's get out.

240
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,241
- I love cougars.
- Fuck you, I'm twenty-four.

241
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:28,047
- MILF? I like that.
- MILF? Where did you find them?

242
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:31,126
- What does Coach Gil?
- He drives here.

243
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:34,261
- We do not have time enough in time.
- Probably not.

244
00:25:34,376 --> 00:25:36,795
- Get out of here!
- You can stay with me.

245
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,384
Thanks, but no thanks.
No less thanks rather.

246
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:47,274
- How will we get there before Sunday?
- We can travel in time.

247
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:54,614
- Or fly, take a bus or train.
- Time warp is better.

248
00:25:54,729 --> 00:26:01,574
- But we have to bring instruments.
- Can not we just hire a big bus?

249
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:05,870
- Guys, you probably have a big bus.
- I can show you a great coach.

250
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:13,962
- How big?
- Awesome! Long, wide, swinging doors...

251
00:26:14,081 --> 00:26:19,337
- ... And emergency exits.
- Almost a little cliche, right?

252
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:25,103
- Are you okay?
- Do you have a brain tumor?

253
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:27,637
No, I need fresh air.

254
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:38,151
We wait for Coach Gil.
He takes us to the competition.

255
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:42,744
There are sixty-nine instruments in the bus
and six of them belonging to Sue Supone.

256
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,166
We need another bus.
We not gonna make it.

257
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,915
We have failed the whole band.

258
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:53,627
- You, Zoe.
- We may hire another bus.

259
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:57,968
- We do not have the money.
- Coach Gill has money?

260
00:26:58,082 --> 00:27:00,633
- Not so much money.
- How much?

261
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:05,142
- A couple of thousand.
- It's better than four thousand.

262
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:09,099
- Much better than four hundred thousand.
- Shut up, you idiot rigmarole!

263
00:27:09,218 --> 00:27:14,985
- She's not an idiot.
- Can everyone just stop talking?

264
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:20,106
- From now on you must not talk.
- I hate you, Mom!

265
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,860
Shut up, everybody!

266
00:27:23,983 --> 00:27:29,666
Here's the plan. I'm looking for
mechanic. Franny!

267
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:37,290
For buses, we could hire.
And others keep you shelter, okay?

268
00:27:42,668 --> 00:27:51,389
- How do we get 2,000?
- Use your body, right?

269
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:54,523
Do we agree? Come on.

270
00:27:57,975 --> 00:28:02,946
we really have to do a pole dance.
We are not getting any younger instantly.

271
00:28:03,063 --> 00:28:06,575
Do I have to show my cupcakes?
Craig calls them that.

272
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:11,573
- Are you ready to write on list?
- Okay!

273
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:15,831
Alice, you can not just write
on whatever. What is that?

274
00:28:15,951 --> 00:28:21,385
Look there. The city is full of prostitutes
saving the tacky behavior.

275
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:27,216
- Okay, I see it.
- During a weekend every year...

276
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:32,724
The city puts...
corruption and condemnation.

277
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:39,771
It's called Spring break.
I call it "Hugs Spring break".

278
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:46,024
For 48 hours transformed the city
to something resembling New Orleans-

279
00:28:46,147 --> 00:28:49,778
South Florida, even Mexico.

280
00:28:49,901 --> 00:28:55,156
With Latinos, Latinas, burritos,
tequila, whatever. Write now.

281
00:28:56,949 --> 00:29:00,792
- Awesome.
- Do you pay to see me dancing?

282
00:29:02,121 --> 00:29:05,004
- No.
- Dancers pond you too?

283
00:29:05,124 --> 00:29:07,841
- No, I do not.
- Are you shy?

284
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,608
No, I just...

285
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:14,770
You have nice breasts,
so you should dance.

286
00:29:14,884 --> 00:29:17,434
Can you write on here?

287
00:29:19,054 --> 00:29:21,522
Thank you.

288
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:27,200
I wonder why she hates
Spring break so much?

289
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:28,528
Maybe she is a Mormon.

290
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:08,673
- Ladies. You're back.
- And you're sitting in front.

291
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:16,170
- Happen to any of you to be a car mechanic?
- Is it an RPG?

292
00:31:16,294 --> 00:31:20,008
- No, seriously.
- No.

293
00:31:20,132 --> 00:31:25,435
- I might be able to help you.
- We need 3000 to fix the bus...

294
00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:29,480
- ... To come to Florida.
- Baby, you do not need to go there.

295
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:37,524
Here craziest, coolest,
spring party here...

296
00:31:37,607 --> 00:31:41,569
... Start here.
- That you do not mean really.

297
00:31:41,652 --> 00:31:46,576
It does not matter. You can
nowhere before you partied with us.

298
00:31:49,494 --> 00:31:51,913
- Okay.
- Right.

299
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,356
Damn!

300
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:21,320
What the hell.

301
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:38,918
- Sorry, did not mean to!
- The bar has been here for fifty years!

302
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:46,303
It has never been changed, and now
completely destroyed! Get out!

303
00:32:46,425 --> 00:32:48,643
Out of my place!

304
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:57,571
- Unbelievable!
- Go to hell, you bastards!

305
00:32:57,686 --> 00:33:00,070
And never came back!

306
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:07,163
- Wow, that was...
- Very cool.

307
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:13,126
She's one of the girls
"anti-spring break" dressed up.

308
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:16,755
I hear exactly what you have done.

309
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:21,676
Awesome. Bar owner Murphy sits in
the Government. A real scalp for us.

310
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:25,304
- I'm not one of you.
- Yes, you have signed.

311
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:29,976
- I did not mean it.
- I want to have a threesome with you.

312
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:33,556
What? I...

313
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:34,932
Where idiots go?

314
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:38,312
Zoe does not to have
a threesome with them.

315
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:43,108
- Fucking slut. What are you doing?
- It's not a threesome.

316
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,694
I would go to the pole and
they drank a shot from my body...

317
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:52,785
- And then start burning...
- Your friend shut down the strip bar.

318
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:57,746
- It's not your fault, right?
- Technically...

319
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,544
Technically, you're an idiot.
And why are you still here?

320
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:08,556
Is there an answer to our bus?
Shut.

321
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:13,061
It will never happen.
We are only making a joke.

322
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,973
- She's just messing around.
- Let's go from here.

323
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,816
No... wait.

324
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,407
Wait! I found it. Jelly!

325
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:43,379
Damn! What have I done?
I'm not driving too fast.

326
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,922
Damn!

327
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:56,467
- Hello there!
- Here is a jelly eating competition

328
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:06,407
- How can we fix the bus?
- The winner will receive $ 800.

329
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:12,073
- 800 dollars to eat jelly.
- And it is not enough for a new bus.

330
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:17,198
- But we can rent one.
- Zoe, you are so smart.

331
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:21,913
- Franny, we know that you love jelly.
- Yes, I do actually.

332
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:28,634
I love this place. They pay
things that will be done for free.

333
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:33,674
- It's true, I can live with eating jelly.
- I've seen it, really sickening.

334
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:37,309
- Can you do it for us?
- Yes, if it takes us to Florida.

335
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:42,358
- Awesome! It's probably at the rear.
- That's what she says.

336
00:35:42,472 --> 00:35:44,691
- Wait.
- What did she say?

337
00:35:58,988 --> 00:36:04,042
- Zoe!
- Alice! Ladies.

338
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,423
Welcome to the forest jelly.

339
00:36:07,538 --> 00:36:12,047
What are you to say sorry,
or are you also going to close it?

340
00:36:12,168 --> 00:36:14,636
- I'm sorry.
- We forgive you.

341
00:36:14,754 --> 00:36:18,467
- Did you notice?
- We are here to win.

342
00:36:18,591 --> 00:36:24,024
- And we have someone who loves jelly.
- She loves it.

343
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:28,563
And we have the jelly.

344
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:37,036
- It is not hygienic.
- Yes, it probably is.

345
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:41,030
- I will not eat it.
- Franny, the national competition.

346
00:36:41,154 --> 00:36:45,794
- No. Even if mom was dying.
- Time to jelly.

347
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:50,548
Who dares to challenge
this nice lady in the jelly hole?

348
00:36:50,622 --> 00:36:54,418
- Some challengers?
- I'll do it.

349
00:36:54,543 --> 00:36:56,797
She!

350
00:37:04,595 --> 00:37:06,931
Will you not do it?

351
00:37:12,518 --> 00:37:16,529
- Excuse me?
- What's the coward?

352
00:37:16,606 --> 00:37:20,747
Coward! Coward! Coward!

353
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,407
I'm no coward, you are a coward!

354
00:37:25,323 --> 00:37:29,036
Are you ready for the jelly?

355
00:37:31,287 --> 00:37:34,751
- Do you have the scoop?
- It is certainly not an eating contest.

356
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:56,440
This bra is worth 30 dollars,
you fucking bitch!

357
00:38:15,455 --> 00:38:17,876
- Replace with me.
- Take me away from here.

358
00:38:21,294 --> 00:38:24,012
My name is Alice!

359
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,647
Zoe!

360
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:57,546
You scare me.

361
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:21,528
In your face. These little girls
do not have a chance here or in Florida.

362
00:39:21,603 --> 00:39:25,068
Where are you? On a band camp?

363
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:32,000
- We are in the camp band.
- Let me make one thing clear.

364
00:39:32,114 --> 00:39:35,377
There is nothing wrong with band camp.

365
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:20,839
I'm the Queen of jelly, bitch!

366
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:27,345
Jelly Queen. You're out!

367
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:32,265
- You can not win!
- Who is the coward now?

368
00:40:32,382 --> 00:40:36,723
- Okay, where's the shower key?
- At home with me.

369
00:40:36,844 --> 00:40:41,732
- No, they need a real shower.
- What is it?

370
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,272
- I think we are clean now.
- No, it's not you.

371
00:41:28,395 --> 00:41:32,025
- No more!
- Can we not just given our prize, thanks.

372
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:36,454
- Yes, our prize.
- Your prize?

373
00:41:42,283 --> 00:41:46,756
Ladies, there are many more.

374
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:51,628
Okay, but what about the money?
800 dollar prize winnings?

375
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:57,635
- Dollar? Are you kidding me?
- No.

376
00:41:57,757 --> 00:42:01,268
- You're kidding, right?
- This is a beer-marketing festival.

377
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:06,605
I get 23 liters of beer.

378
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:10,437
- 20 Bottles 1.2 liters.
- What the hell!

379
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:15,615
- This is a delicious beer.
- I hate you now!

380
00:42:21,864 --> 00:42:24,331
More for us.

381
00:42:25,492 --> 00:42:28,292
- It's not bad.
- Right?

382
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,875
- Damn.
- It's better than McDonalds.

383
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:40,180
Honey, you do not need to remind me.

384
00:42:40,299 --> 00:42:44,391
No, I am aware of
that the principal is your brother.

385
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:49,527
What? Why must plumber sleep over?

386
00:42:50,266 --> 00:42:57,112
No, I do not buy.
There is not so large leaks.

387
00:42:58,483 --> 00:43:05,079
Ok? If it is so how are you want it...
Bye.

388
00:43:08,117 --> 00:43:10,419
Bitch.

389
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:14,171
What!
What's going on?

390
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:18,259
Flat tire or what?

391
00:43:19,004 --> 00:43:21,304
Damn?

392
00:43:27,678 --> 00:43:32,317
And I'm not even close.
Hell!

393
00:43:39,523 --> 00:43:44,909
- Hi.
- What do you have against Spring break?

394
00:43:45,028 --> 00:43:47,793
I'm not a religious fanatic.
It's all about the city.

395
00:43:47,907 --> 00:43:52,213
- It's all about you.
- The act of injustice.

396
00:43:52,327 --> 00:43:59,303
- You really need to lie.
- With the stupid bastard? Never.

397
00:43:59,418 --> 00:44:04,092
- Do you think they will be with you?
- I hate all of this.

398
00:44:04,214 --> 00:44:12,518
- I love men, not stupid boys.
- You need a LB in there.

399
00:44:12,598 --> 00:44:15,610
- LB?
- L... Forget it.

400
00:44:15,725 --> 00:44:19,606
You know neither me or town.
They need guidance.

401
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,573
- And will you give them?
- I do not know, but yes.

402
00:44:23,692 --> 00:44:29,291
Then? What will you accomplish?
Take away the fun for everyone?

403
00:44:29,405 --> 00:44:36,167
No, we can still have fun.
Parlour Games. Good, clean fun.

404
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:44,384
What a fucking shit.
Every fucking year.

405
00:44:44,504 --> 00:44:49,392
- Let's go. Damn prohibition jerks!
- But...

406
00:44:54,805 --> 00:44:57,060
wait.

407
00:44:58,225 --> 00:45:01,607
- Wait.
- You ruined my hair.

408
00:45:01,729 --> 00:45:06,652
- Franny is completely despair. Beer?
- I told you I was sorry.

409
00:45:06,775 --> 00:45:12,458
I did not know it was wrestling.
Do you think I'd let you do that?

410
00:45:12,573 --> 00:45:18,421
- No, not ever.
- You should not be talking about jelly.

411
00:45:18,537 --> 00:45:22,001
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly...

412
00:45:22,124 --> 00:45:24,841
Stop it!

413
00:45:27,546 --> 00:45:30,559
It was a well-meant mistake.

414
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:38,561
I said I was sorry.
It just happened.

415
00:45:40,392 --> 00:45:45,232
Look. We can still take us
to the national competition.

416
00:45:46,398 --> 00:45:49,862
- Can I see?
- This is what counts.

417
00:45:49,985 --> 00:45:54,409
we do not show the breast for another beer.
we will stay at a motel.

418
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:57,959
- I agree.
- It's probably just a joke.

419
00:45:58,076 --> 00:46:01,956
- Observing the price.
- A trip to Miami on a party bus.

420
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:07,881
- What is a party bus?
- One that takes the band and instruments.

421
00:46:10,213 --> 00:46:14,139
Not a chance.
Zoe, I'm done with your nonsense.

422
00:46:14,258 --> 00:46:17,935
- No perverts get to see my breasts.
- Did they only just.

423
00:46:18,053 --> 00:46:23,191
- Yes, but I do not like it.
- But, we...

424
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,991
I did not do it, then forget it, Zoe.

425
00:46:32,234 --> 00:46:36,955
I did not think you'd do it really.

426
00:46:38,824 --> 00:46:43,794
- Who is that?
- Objectively speaking, there is only one...

427
00:46:43,912 --> 00:46:48,338
- ... With perfectly shaped breasts.
- Who?

428
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:51,223
- You?
- No, not me. Alice.

429
00:46:51,336 --> 00:46:58,312
- I? No...
- They are perfect, symmetrical...

430
00:46:59,678 --> 00:47:05,112
- You could be featured in Playboy.
- Do you really believe that?

431
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:10,398
- Craig never said anything.
- Sweetie, Craig is gay.

432
00:47:10,522 --> 00:47:15,908
- He is a cocksucking ass boy.
- Impossible. He has a small dick only.

433
00:47:16,027 --> 00:47:19,704
- Not for these guys.
- It's pretty cute.

434
00:47:19,822 --> 00:47:23,536
"Hi Alice. This is little Craig.
Would you do it? "

435
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:29,378
- There's nothing cute about it.
- You do not have to be naked.

436
00:47:29,499 --> 00:47:32,880
- No?
- It is a wet t-shirt contest.

437
00:47:33,002 --> 00:47:35,500
Do you keep the shirt on?

438
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:39,847
Oh my God, the whole
school have seen them.

439
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:42,471
- It's true.
- Set up for the team.

440
00:47:42,595 --> 00:47:46,771
- Okay!
- Come on, it starts in five minutes.

441
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:51,064
This is the way.

442
00:47:53,856 --> 00:47:59,373
- Do we have go of this?
- Would you go to the race or not?

443
00:48:00,988 --> 00:48:03,324
We will probably...

444
00:48:09,162 --> 00:48:13,469
- Are we going to the Everglades?
- Did you hear that?

445
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:17,546
- Beware of alligators.
- They are so cute.

446
00:48:17,671 --> 00:48:21,099
- And snakes.
- They are also sweet.

447
00:48:21,216 --> 00:48:26,685
- Poo would be cute for you.
- Craig forcing me to...

448
00:48:26,805 --> 00:48:29,569
No, we do not want to hear.

449
00:48:30,851 --> 00:48:33,069
Music!

450
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:52,255
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

451
00:48:52,371 --> 00:48:54,756
- Hurry up now.
- I'm ready.

452
00:49:04,049 --> 00:49:07,099
Come on! What are you doing?

453
00:49:09,139 --> 00:49:13,729
It is the angled pedal to the right.
Shit.

454
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:26,285
Go ahead, sign here.
Excellent. Number one. Next.

455
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:32,668
Welcome. Write here, thanks.
Those will be excellent.

456
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:38,716
- Control you all up here?
- Everything about spring break.

457
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:42,844
- Are you going to shut this down also?
- No, not this time.

458
00:49:42,963 --> 00:49:47,435
- I wanted to show you my friend's tits.
- I see that.

459
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:54,526
It pleases us, madam.
You will be number three. Here you go.

460
00:49:55,642 --> 00:49:59,604
- If you see cops over there?
- Yes, what is it with him?

461
00:49:59,729 --> 00:50:07,749
He has warned us that no one can undress
spring break-ban sucks.

462
00:50:07,862 --> 00:50:12,122
Thanks, I started there,
without trying to finish it.

463
00:50:12,241 --> 00:50:14,543
And trust me, no undressing.

464
00:50:16,163 --> 00:50:18,666
Good, next!

465
00:50:22,461 --> 00:50:25,509
You have to game now.

466
00:50:31,677 --> 00:50:36,731
Alice, throw your bra,
if you want a chance to win.

467
00:50:43,481 --> 00:50:47,788
- You can do it here.
- Okay.

468
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:52,574
Okay, take this. Good job.

469
00:50:55,409 --> 00:51:00,546
Okay, welcome to the first wet
t-shirt contest during Spring Break!

470
00:51:00,664 --> 00:51:03,382
A big round of applause for the girls!

471
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,802
Here we have participant number one!
Make her wet.

472
00:51:42,789 --> 00:51:45,588
Participant number two.

473
00:52:15,738 --> 00:52:21,254
Do not worry. Encourage her.

474
00:52:53,191 --> 00:52:55,493
Am I too late?

475
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:04,456
Wait a minute. We have certain
a last-minute participants.

476
00:54:14,772 --> 00:54:19,659
You have broken the law if
disorderly conduct.

477
00:54:19,776 --> 00:54:23,833
- Pacific!
- No one was at off himself, I told you!

478
00:54:23,947 --> 00:54:27,459
One of the participants
will probably just be free.

479
00:54:31,579 --> 00:54:34,629
Come on.

480
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,964
- Why they arrest him?
- Come.

481
00:54:44,425 --> 00:54:47,143
I'm so sorry.

482
00:54:47,262 --> 00:54:51,521
- It was not your fault, but Zoe.
- No, it was not Zoe's fault.

483
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:57,401
- Did she ask you to be naked?
- I do not know anything.

484
00:54:58,231 --> 00:55:02,703
- Again she broke down a regional final.
- Not on purpose.

485
00:55:02,818 --> 00:55:05,868
I know, it is your fault.

486
00:55:08,324 --> 00:55:12,998
- Hello, girls.
- You certainly got what you wanted.

487
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,706
- You are for this to brag.
- Can I say that her now?

488
00:55:15,831 --> 00:55:21,134
- No, she's cute and her hair smells nice.
- Really?

489
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:27,558
- Damn.
- Thank you.

490
00:55:27,634 --> 00:55:34,100
Are you happy now? Zack is gone.
What should I do now?

491
00:55:34,224 --> 00:55:37,688
On Monday,
I work as an accountant again.

492
00:55:38,603 --> 00:55:41,487
Right. I turn into a pumpkin.

493
00:55:43,066 --> 00:55:49,033
This would be my weekend
until you came along and ruined it.

494
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:55,419
I can not do anything right.

495
00:55:59,374 --> 00:56:02,173
Girls, hello...?

496
00:56:02,293 --> 00:56:06,968
- What did you do to her?
- I? She did it.

497
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:10,803
Zoe is the smartest
and the most beautiful girl in the world.

498
00:56:10,927 --> 00:56:16,562
She once saved a cat and
let me write her homework. Leave her alone.

499
00:56:18,393 --> 00:56:24,027
I did not do anything. She feels good
until you show up, you're a freak.

500
00:56:25,066 --> 00:56:30,155
- We are not freaks, but a band.
- As can be national champions.

501
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:38,586
Wait. Freaks?

502
00:56:40,915 --> 00:56:43,216
I like that.

503
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,571
Shit. The first flat tire
First flat tire and now ran out of gas.

504
00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:17,413
- How is the situation? Guys!
- We're going to fuck your mom!

505
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:22,205
Fucking asshole.

506
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:33,432
Sorry, you are fine gentlemen.
It's easy.

507
00:57:33,549 --> 00:57:38,556
- We gonna fuck you in the ass?
- You is not no asshole, but the gentlemen.

508
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:43,353
- It's okay.
- Is it true?

509
00:57:52,568 --> 00:57:56,448
I can not answer.

510
00:57:57,365 --> 00:57:59,998
I gonna go the message.

511
00:58:00,993 --> 00:58:04,670
What a day. Shit.

512
00:58:10,586 --> 00:58:13,551
- What the hell are you doing?
- Check it out.

513
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:19,560
- But Spring break is not over.
- Well, that's it.

514
00:58:19,637 --> 00:58:24,311
The mayor got my application and she
is very close to writing in my ban.

515
00:58:24,433 --> 00:58:27,281
- We win. Thank you, girls.
- You're welcome.

516
00:58:27,394 --> 00:58:30,775
- We do not want to stop.
- We just wanted to Miami.

517
00:58:30,897 --> 00:58:34,113
- There's more to do. See you.
- Hey, hey.

518
00:58:36,403 --> 00:58:39,951
I hate her
and her beautiful blonde hair.

519
00:58:40,074 --> 00:58:44,664
Forget her. We're looking up the coach Gil
and pulls away.

520
00:58:44,786 --> 00:58:49,258
- I'm sorry
- How many times are you going to apologize?

521
00:58:49,374 --> 00:58:54,843
I'm not even angry anymore.
you did not do it on purpose

522
00:58:54,963 --> 00:58:59,684
but you can always ruin everything.
always you.

523
00:59:00,927 --> 00:59:07,439
Save it, okay?
My life is ruined, it's over.

524
00:59:07,558 --> 00:59:12,482
I might as well accept it.
I need a drink.

525
00:59:36,087 --> 00:59:42,303
- You there! Stop following us.
- Are you not in jail?

526
00:59:42,426 --> 00:59:47,564
- We know the sheriff, so...
- Listen, your disgust. We will put us...

527
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:51,862
and... have a drink,
so stop sexy harassing us.

528
00:59:51,977 --> 00:59:56,117
What's the fun in that? Besizes
Zoe has ruined our Spring Break...

529
00:59:56,231 --> 01:00:00,822
- ... So we might as well be with.
- Excuse me.

530
01:00:00,944 --> 01:00:03,198
Zoe.

531
01:00:05,949 --> 01:00:08,203
- Shots!
- Idiot.

532
01:00:18,211 --> 01:00:21,805
- Are you okay?
- Not. I had a bad day.

533
01:00:21,923 --> 01:00:25,553
- May I?
- It would be incredible

534
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:34,521
- What happened?
- Cursed Spring break-makers.

535
01:00:34,644 --> 01:00:41,536
- What evokes the animal in us these years?
- Lack of morality, bad parents...

536
01:00:41,609 --> 01:00:45,405
- ... Global warming, pop culture.
- Yes.

537
01:00:48,741 --> 01:00:53,795
What are you doing?
I'm married and so on...

538
01:00:54,789 --> 01:01:00,388
The thing is that my wife let the
plumber sleep over, so whatever.

539
01:01:07,969 --> 01:01:11,147
Zoe, wait! What are you doing?

540
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:15,694
- I can get the money.
- Are you...

541
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:20,531
- You can not sell Charlie.
- You said...

542
01:01:20,606 --> 01:01:27,664
Maybe I was shitty, but
it is because I love to win

543
01:01:27,779 --> 01:01:31,161
And you always ruin everything,
but you do not do it.

544
01:01:33,576 --> 01:01:35,796
Listen, I...

545
01:01:39,123 --> 01:01:43,798
I'm very tired,
and this trip was a disaster.

546
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:48,345
If I can get the money
so we come to Miami in time...

547
01:01:49,926 --> 01:01:53,390
I thought you loved
your euphonium more than anything else.

548
01:01:53,513 --> 01:01:57,290
We have the chance to
become the best in the world.

549
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:59,397
Maybe the best in the world.

550
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:02,948
Only in the country technically, but...

551
01:02:04,899 --> 01:02:09,656
I have no doubt been a bitch
on this trip.

552
01:02:09,779 --> 01:02:15,497
- I owe you an apology.
- It's okay.

553
01:02:15,577 --> 01:02:21,378
you who you are,
and I am who I am.

554
01:02:21,499 --> 01:02:26,054
- Are you sure about this?
- This is a national tournament.

555
01:02:28,297 --> 01:02:30,302
Yes.

556
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,982
She is okay.

557
01:02:39,725 --> 01:02:47,400
- What do you do when you're not drunk?
- I was lonely, pathetic accountant.

558
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:51,247
- I am a special education teacher.
- Take care of retarded?

559
01:02:51,362 --> 01:02:53,865
They are so cute.

560
01:02:53,989 --> 01:02:57,335
- Is it a replica or something?
- No, I love my Mongon.

561
01:02:57,451 --> 01:03:00,250
We came here on a school bus.

562
01:03:03,707 --> 01:03:07,717
- No way I do it.
- Why would we do that?

563
01:03:07,836 --> 01:03:14,348
- Do it there, you get loot.
- So, you can rent a bus.

564
01:03:14,467 --> 01:03:19,687
A good attempt off these cowboys.

565
01:03:19,806 --> 01:03:23,768
Is the next victim ready? Do not be afraid.
An attempt person.

566
01:03:24,769 --> 01:03:31,698
The record is twenty seconds.
Can you thirty win $ 100.

567
01:03:31,818 --> 01:03:37,666
$ 100 covers it.
Remember not wet t-shirt fiasco?

568
01:03:37,782 --> 01:03:40,630
- You mean you are like putting off?
- No.

569
01:03:40,743 --> 01:03:48,667
- Okay, it's okay. Drink up and enjoy life.
- Cheers to lay off!

570
01:03:50,336 --> 01:03:55,888
You're she.
I have seen the video ten times today.

571
01:03:56,008 --> 01:04:00,647
- Which video?
- Hey, take a picture.

572
01:04:03,641 --> 01:04:10,153
Wet t-shirt-contest.
The best video. Five million hits.

573
01:04:10,272 --> 01:04:17,248
- We are famous!
- Alice, this is very bad.

574
01:04:17,363 --> 01:04:22,037
- But we are famous!
- Anyone can view the video.

575
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:25,871
Can all? So everyone...

576
01:04:25,995 --> 01:04:30,587
I said,
"I like the color of the future."

577
01:04:40,886 --> 01:04:43,354
Poo Bear!

578
01:04:44,263 --> 01:04:45,759
You're cute, you're cute,

579
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,571
you're really cute, you
are very cute also...

580
01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:51,402
you're too high.

581
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:58,283
- Where have you been?
- Zoe sacrificed herself for the band.

582
01:05:00,655 --> 01:05:06,124
That means a lot of sucking and fucking.
Is that true?

583
01:05:08,329 --> 01:05:12,422
- Anal or what?
- Where did you get them from, Zoe?

584
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:17,298
- It's no big deal.
- She sold her euphonium for our sake.

585
01:05:17,421 --> 01:05:20,351
- What are you doing?
- I've really messed up, so...

586
01:05:20,465 --> 01:05:26,765
- But Charlie belonged to your grandmother.
- When did you become friends?

587
01:05:26,888 --> 01:05:30,152
we're on the same team
and have the same goal.

588
01:05:30,153 --> 01:05:32,027
we will win this together.

589
01:05:32,144 --> 01:05:39,285
That's still not enough. We need
at least 200 dollars to the bus.

590
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:40,567
We can fix it.

591
01:05:40,568 --> 01:05:43,992
How will you participate
without euphonium?

592
01:05:44,115 --> 01:05:49,085
- Borrow someone else's.
- Breast I was there on the web.

593
01:05:49,203 --> 01:05:52,584
- Is it good?
- It's good for many others.

594
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:59,548
- Who is going to ride this?
- I can do it.

595
01:05:59,629 --> 01:06:03,306
I have certainly missed something.
Bull, boobs, internet, what...

596
01:06:03,424 --> 01:06:07,517
- The bull does not give so much.
- I get nothing.

597
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,302
All may well ride it?

598
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:13,528
So everyone can get one
hundred U.S. dollars each.

599
01:06:13,643 --> 01:06:17,274
But I do not understand that.
It's fucking nasty!

600
01:06:17,397 --> 01:06:24,028
Okay, I'm on? But if I ride it
so must all do it. Is that clear?

601
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:31,746
- Zoe?
- Okay, I guess.

602
01:06:31,869 --> 01:06:37,587
- Who's first?
- I'll do it. Out of the way, ladies.

603
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,463
I'll take a shootin.

604
01:06:46,258 --> 01:06:49,889
So are you ready to ride a bull?

605
01:06:50,012 --> 01:06:54,354
We have someone who will ride on bull.

606
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:20,095
- You were totally useless.
- He had rigged it.

607
01:07:20,208 --> 01:07:23,305
- Move the way, my turn.
- She's excited.

608
01:07:23,419 --> 01:07:27,382
we have a new competitor.

609
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:45,534
I slipped...

610
01:07:52,365 --> 01:07:54,833
up with another victim.

611
01:07:57,453 --> 01:07:59,956
Queen Jelly!

612
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,141
She fell down.

613
01:08:32,696 --> 01:08:36,540
- Zoe, you are our last hope.
- It's over.

614
01:08:36,659 --> 01:08:40,206
- No, I can handle it.
- You can not even go without falling.

615
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:44,754
- I'll handle this, okay?
- Zoe, you can do it.

616
01:08:54,551 --> 01:08:57,849
Zoe! Zoe! Zoe!

617
01:09:45,267 --> 01:09:48,649
- Wow! Backwards.
- Yes!

618
01:10:01,408 --> 01:10:03,460
You are so sweet.

619
01:10:33,773 --> 01:10:38,530
- Zoe! Zoe!
- Amazing!

620
01:10:42,573 --> 01:10:45,422
Okay!

621
01:10:48,246 --> 01:10:51,094
- Remarkable lady.
- Thank you.

622
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,837
I've never seen anything like it before.

623
01:10:55,962 --> 01:11:00,303
I have taken the bull where for ten years
and have never seen anything like it.

624
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:02,893
So long it counts, right?

625
01:11:04,179 --> 01:11:12,945
It is another thing. There are
no rules, should not ride naked.

626
01:11:14,563 --> 01:11:17,528
- But it's not my fault.
- Yes, it's not right.

627
01:11:17,608 --> 01:11:20,158
There are rules.

628
01:11:21,737 --> 01:11:27,669
And there is another question.
Do you see the handsome man over there?

629
01:11:27,785 --> 01:11:34,381
- We'll talk later, guys.
- Does he know that you are serving minors?

630
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:38,889
- Are you underage?
- It depends on if we get the money.

631
01:11:39,004 --> 01:11:45,267
we have been raising money all day.
We're going to the national tournament.

632
01:11:47,054 --> 01:11:50,648
You probably have bigger
problems than this Miss.

633
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:56,365
I wish you luck.
Detective, they are yours.

634
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:06,325
- I want to talk to you, miss.
- It was not my fault, but an accident.

635
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:11,999
- To show themselves naked in public?
- Did not you see what happened?

636
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:16,343
- I will take testimony later.
- Even when you win, you lose.

637
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:21,096
I arrest you for
disorderly conduct.

638
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:26,349
Everything you do or say
can be used against you in court.

639
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:29,185
- Come with me.
- What are you doing?

640
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:32,400
- Fucking asshole!
- Zoe!

641
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,991
It's the same thing every year.
Filling, naked, sex...

642
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:46,996
- I did not have sex.
- Zoe...

643
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:52,712
- Look who we found.
- How did you and... are you here?

644
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:55,162
- She saved me.
- It's true.

645
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:59,629
- Do they take you to jail?
- Fifteen years to life.

646
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,965
- $ 50? Is that all?
- Would you pay more?

647
01:13:04,087 --> 01:13:08,643
- No, that's fine.
- Have a good day. I have to work.

648
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:15,519
- Zoe, I should have known.
- My shirt got stuck in the bull.

649
01:13:15,598 --> 01:13:19,525
- Is that what you call it these days?
- It's true, totally fucking crazy.

650
01:13:19,644 --> 01:13:26,323
- If we win the contest, coach Gil?
- What... no, unfortunately.

651
01:13:26,442 --> 01:13:29,326
- Why do you look like he?
- How?

652
01:13:29,446 --> 01:13:32,660
- Have you been raped?
- Raped?

653
01:13:32,782 --> 01:13:41,051
- All day with this shit.
- Yes. We rent a bus to Florida.

654
01:13:41,165 --> 01:13:45,507
- If we are lucky we will get there in time.
- And if we're unlucky?

655
01:13:45,586 --> 01:13:50,723
- You ought to leave here immediately.
- You would like huh, Adolf?

656
01:13:50,841 --> 01:13:54,769
Yes, I would.
Besides that I go with you.

657
01:13:56,388 --> 01:14:00,102
Spring break is over. There is no
left here besides Walmart.

658
01:14:00,226 --> 01:14:05,196
- Damn! So it's over.
- I'm not fighting for a year.

659
01:14:05,314 --> 01:14:07,569
哦，宝贝
Oh, baby.

660
01:14:09,818 --> 01:14:13,615
- Florida, here we come!
- Is Florida not much worse than this?

661
01:14:13,739 --> 01:14:18,248
- Not if Gil is there.
- We'll find out there. Come on.

662
01:14:42,684 --> 01:14:46,361
- Any problem, officer?
- License and registration.

663
01:14:49,733 --> 01:14:55,748
- Unfortunately I've forgotten my wallet...
- You may not break the law.

664
01:14:55,864 --> 01:14:59,921
- No, but my girlfriend is...
- Driving a vehicle without a license...

665
01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:04,091
... Is a serious offense in the state
Florida. Especially without domestic plates.

666
01:15:04,205 --> 01:15:08,168
- Do you have any id-cone?
- I have no wallet.

667
01:15:08,293 --> 01:15:11,756
- Nothing?
- My name is Craig Wasserman and live...

668
01:15:11,879 --> 01:15:17,134
- I do not care what you say.
- This is urgent, I must go.

669
01:15:17,259 --> 01:15:21,602
- Get out of the vehicle.
- What? I can not...

670
01:15:21,723 --> 01:15:26,195
There is no preference.
You follow along to the station, come on.

671
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:28,611
I do not want.

672
01:15:31,232 --> 01:15:33,996
- Craig? Snoopy rabbit?
- Poo bear.

673
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:36,529
- What happened?
- I have not done anything wrong.

674
01:15:36,612 --> 01:15:39,376
- Do you know him?
- Yes.

675
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:46,915
Hey, snoopy rabbit. You are free, but run
not until you have a driver's license.

676
01:15:47,038 --> 01:15:49,459
Get out of here.

677
01:15:50,417 --> 01:15:53,050
- What are you doing here?
- You may not go to Florida.

678
01:15:53,169 --> 01:15:57,346
- It is clear that we can.
- You do not go there because you won.

679
01:15:57,466 --> 01:16:00,929
- Are you kidding?
- Do you know why you get to go?

680
01:16:01,052 --> 01:16:05,146
- Do they like our personalities?
- Tell me, coach.

681
01:16:05,265 --> 01:16:08,647
You go because of the video clip
jumbotron.

682
01:16:09,645 --> 01:16:12,278
- What?
- I know it!

683
01:16:13,189 --> 01:16:19,489
I need a break. They will
make you laugh. I'm sorry.

684
01:16:19,571 --> 01:16:24,410
- Why?
- The headmaster got a call and you know...

685
01:16:24,534 --> 01:16:32,091
Your audience was huge,
so he was offered 10,000 for coming.

686
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:38,092
- What should I say? You are popular.
- 10000 takes us to the competition.

687
01:16:38,214 --> 01:16:41,678
- Forget it, Zoe. It's over.
- Why can not we play?

688
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:45,941
Why can not we play?
It's what we love and want to do.

689
01:16:46,055 --> 01:16:50,112
- Who cares if we are a joke?
- I do.

690
01:16:50,226 --> 01:16:54,900
- Me too.
- No, you should not do it.

691
01:16:55,022 --> 01:16:59,613
we go and entertain them.
We let them have fun.

692
01:17:00,569 --> 01:17:05,789
- Coach, you drive us to Miami?
- Yes, we should go even though we suck.

693
01:17:05,908 --> 01:17:09,372
- Even though we hit shit.
- I know I suck.

694
01:17:09,495 --> 01:17:14,251
- So do we all. Coach?
- Yes, we've come this far, so...

695
01:17:18,295 --> 01:17:22,518
I am pawn now, idiot.
I need my fucking money.

696
01:17:23,759 --> 01:17:27,389
Yes, everything!
No, it's not enough.

697
01:17:30,057 --> 01:17:32,310
Jump in.

698
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:52,129
- We're almost there.
- What's that noise?

699
01:18:03,547 --> 01:18:07,391
- What the hell is that?
- We will die, everyone!

700
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:13,063
- Silence! Calm down.
- Someone does not want us going forward.

701
01:18:13,182 --> 01:18:18,153
I can not see shit.
I can not run into this.

702
01:18:18,271 --> 01:18:20,607
- Stop the car.
- What?

703
01:18:30,074 --> 01:18:36,836
I put on my jacket. Hails it?
Talk on temperature drop.

704
01:18:36,956 --> 01:18:41,546
- Close the window!
- We are not insured for this!

705
01:18:41,668 --> 01:18:46,389
- Yes, I want a Christmas gift this year.
- Is that your final wishes.

706
01:18:46,506 --> 01:18:50,268
- No, it is not!
- Are you a libertarian?

707
01:18:50,386 --> 01:18:55,938
- Is this the end of us?
- Flower County evacuated.

708
01:18:56,058 --> 01:18:59,521
With me, I have a representative
from the Finnish Meteorological Institute.

709
01:18:59,644 --> 01:19:06,739
- John, what do you say about the storm
- How far is it to the stadium?

710
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:10,822
- They may postpone the contest.
- We have to come out.

711
01:19:10,947 --> 01:19:16,464
- They may postpone the event.
- If we do not show up, we washed.

712
01:19:16,536 --> 01:19:21,092
- Let me drive, we have to win the contest.
- Yes!

713
01:19:22,917 --> 01:19:26,299
- We have to win the race!
- Yes!

714
01:19:42,228 --> 01:19:44,447
Take it easy, we can do it.

715
01:19:51,738 --> 01:19:54,952
Calm down!

716
01:20:14,134 --> 01:20:18,393
We made it!

717
01:20:24,728 --> 01:20:28,275
- Everything is gone.
- This must be...

718
01:20:28,398 --> 01:20:32,325
there is a category 5 hurricane to
be canceled

719
01:20:32,444 --> 01:20:34,912
- No contest?
- No.

720
01:20:36,781 --> 01:20:39,499
- So clear...
- No, wait, we just got...

721
01:20:39,576 --> 01:20:44,546
We are from Woodville and have run
a huge stretch for this.

722
01:20:44,664 --> 01:20:47,761
- Did not you see the storm?
- And then?

723
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:52,965
No one else showed up. There will be no
contest without auditioning.

724
01:20:53,089 --> 01:21:00,598
- But we have traveled all the way.
- So I guess we are the winners?

725
01:21:00,721 --> 01:21:04,814
Winner of what?
There is not any other bands here.

726
01:21:04,934 --> 01:21:08,809
You were the only ones
crazy enough to come.

727
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:11,530
Technically washed all others.

728
01:21:11,608 --> 01:21:14,537
- Therefore, we win.
- She may be right.

729
01:21:14,610 --> 01:21:19,913
Sure. Here you go. Congrats.

730
01:21:24,703 --> 01:21:27,004
Thank you! Thank you!

731
01:21:28,374 --> 01:21:30,924
That's it. Girls!

732
01:21:38,467 --> 01:21:40,721
You deserved it.

733
01:21:43,179 --> 01:21:48,567
- Cute, right? Good shit.
- How did that happen?

734
01:21:48,686 --> 01:21:51,070
Maybe I can drink something out of it.

735
01:21:54,691 --> 01:21:56,242
We did not even...

736
01:21:56,243 --> 01:22:00,041
I know, but the victory
was apparently great.

737
01:22:00,155 --> 01:22:04,544
The chairman called me personally
to tell you about our new sponsors.

738
01:22:04,659 --> 01:22:09,499
Investors, all sorts showed up.

739
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:13,886
You did a great job for the school.

740
01:22:14,001 --> 01:22:21,096
I thank you.
If you need anything, let me know.

741
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:24,265
Anything?

742
01:22:56,077 --> 01:22:58,128
We're back.

743
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:03,261
- Jelly!
- Oh yeah.

744
01:23:06,518 --> 01:23:12,518
(Zimuku version
without chinese)
