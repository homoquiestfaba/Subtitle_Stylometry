1
00:00:00,759 --> 00:00:01,967
[engine whirring]

2
00:00:01,967 --> 00:00:03,624
- [Dementia] Oh there
 it is, that's it.

3
00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:04,694
Pull in here.

4
00:00:04,694 --> 00:00:06,075
[keys jangling]

5
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:08,111
[logo whooshing]

6
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:10,182
Come one, what are
 you waiting for?

7
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:13,047
- [Dez] Oh, I can't
 believe you talked me

8
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:16,188
into coming out here in the
 middle of the night like this.

9
00:00:16,188 --> 00:00:17,672
- [Dementia] Oh,
 get out here silly.

10
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:20,675
- [Dez] Yeah, I'm
 coming, I'm coming.

11
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:22,850
[door opens]

12
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,404
[door beeping]

13
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,236
[door closes]

14
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:32,446
[camera whirring]
 Okay,

15
00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:34,482
let me focus this damn thing.

16
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:37,934
Where are you?
 Oh, there you are.

17
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:45,459
- It's "Dez and Dementia's
 Midnight Horror Hour."

18
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:49,256
With your hostess,
 Dementia Shame.

19
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:52,121
[Dementia giggles]

20
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:52,949
- [Dez] Cute.

21
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:57,747
We are gonna get so busted.

22
00:00:57,747 --> 00:00:59,473
[Dementia chuckles]

23
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:01,268
- And you weren't
 worried about that

24
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:04,443
the first time we
 came back here.

25
00:01:04,443 --> 00:01:05,927
Remember?

26
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:07,895
The back seat of
 your parents' car?

27
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,553
- [Dez] Oh yeah.

28
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:14,488
[Dementia giggles and kisses]

29
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,353
- You know, I wish they'd
 put there damn mall

30
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:18,181
someplace else.

31
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:21,771
This is our place.

32
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:23,704
- [Dez] Our place, huh?

33
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:25,326
- Yeah.

34
00:01:25,326 --> 00:01:27,501
As in our first time.

35
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:29,019
- [Dez] Wait a minute.

36
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:30,538
What about that night in
 your parents' living room

37
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:32,885
during the "Bob Newhart Show?"

38
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,440
- [chuckles] That doesn't count.

39
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,648
It wasn't a full moon.

40
00:01:37,614 --> 00:01:39,064
- [Dez] Got it, sorry.

41
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,104
- Yeah, I just wish
 they'd take the bulldozers

42
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,692
and go way.

43
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:52,560
Anyway, I thought
 we'd come up here

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,253
for one last fling.

45
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:56,081
- [Dez] Fling?

46
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:58,290
- Yeah. Come on.

47
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:00,706
- [Dez] Come on where?

48
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:03,019
- Let's have a look around.
 - Are you kidding?

49
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:04,607
It's the middle of the night.

50
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:06,126
And it's dark in there.

51
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:11,131
- Oh, is my big, bad goth
 boy afraid of the dark?

52
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:13,271
- [Dez] No, hell no.

53
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:16,481
- What is it then?

54
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:19,311
The witches?

55
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:21,002
- [Dez] Yeah, right.

56
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,111
- Oh, come on, we
 all know the stories

57
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:31,116
about all the witches buried
 in the woods out here.

58
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:35,569
Oh, we even believed
 'em when we were kids.

59
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:38,192
- [Dez] Yeah, we believed
 in the Tooth Fairy too.

60
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,608
- Oh, okay.

61
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:41,989
So you're not scared.

62
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:44,509
Come on, let's go.

63
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:46,856
- [Dez] Why don't we come
 back tomorrow before sunset?

64
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:48,582
I mean, the light
 will be better.

65
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:49,893
- You have light.

66
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,242
Besides, I don't wanna
 come back tomorrow.

67
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:55,968
I'm in the mood now.

68
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:58,350
- Really?
 - Mm-hmm.

69
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:02,561
Please.

70
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:07,773
Pretty please?

71
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:13,538
Do it for me.

72
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:17,162
[Dementia giggles]

73
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:18,646
- [Dez] You better make
good on that promise

74
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:22,063
if I have to go into
 these damn woods.

75
00:03:22,063 --> 00:03:25,101
[insects chirping]

76
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:28,415
Dementia, where are you?

77
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:31,211
This is no time to
 play hide and seek.

78
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:35,076
Is she out of her mind?

79
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:56,201
Dementia. Come on.

80
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,651
This isn't funny anymore.

81
00:03:58,548 --> 00:03:59,860
- Boo!
- Jesus!

82
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,587
I almost pissed myself.

83
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:05,486
- Oh, come on. Would
 you lighten up?

84
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:07,247
- [Dez] How do you
 know the we're alone?

85
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,284
I mean, anybody could
be out here watching us.

86
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,148
- Ooh. A witch, maybe.

87
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,670
After all, this is
 their place too.

88
00:04:18,741 --> 00:04:21,261
They're probably as
 pissed off as we are.

89
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:26,404
Maybe they're pissed
off enough for revenge.

90
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:28,647
[Dementia giggles]
 - Yeah,

91
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:30,925
well you can just...
 [snarling]

92
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:31,823
Did you hear that?

93
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:36,517
- Hear what?

94
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:37,829
- [Dez] I heard something.

95
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,833
- [chuckles] You
are so paranoid.

96
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,248
- [Dez] I'm not fucking around.

97
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:44,905
I heard something.

98
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:47,010
- I'm sorry. It's my fault.

99
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,599
I had to go bring up all
the big, bad witches.

100
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:52,222
- [Dez] That's not the point.

101
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:54,742
I'm telling you, somebody
 else is out here.

102
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:58,090
- Yeah, just bra me.

103
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:04,269
You know what? I should
have known better.

104
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:05,684
To think that this place

105
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:08,549
held any sentimental
 value to you at all.

106
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:10,689
- [Dez] You know
that's not true.

107
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,967
[snorting]

108
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:17,386
- I heard it that time.

109
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:19,111
- [Dez] I can't see anything.

110
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:23,944
- You know, let's go
 back to the car, okay?

111
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:32,711
We can't even be alone without
 some pervs spying on us.

112
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:34,713
- [Dez] Come on,
 the car's not far.

113
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:37,164
[whispering]

114
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:39,856
Shit!

115
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,997
- [Dementia] Oh God,
 they're following us!

116
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:43,998
- [Dez] Are you sure?

117
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:46,518
I hear something
up in the trees!

118
00:05:46,518 --> 00:05:48,589
- [Dementia] I don't
 even have a shirt!

119
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:49,418
- [Dez] Forget it.

120
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:50,798
I'll buy you a new one.

121
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:53,905
- Ow! Ow!

122
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,425
- [Dez] Are you all right?

123
00:05:57,702 --> 00:05:59,531
- Yeah. Fine.

124
00:05:59,531 --> 00:06:00,808
[blade scraping]

125
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:01,982
[machete whooshes]
 [flesh squelches]

126
00:06:01,982 --> 00:06:03,363
[Dez gasping]
 [Dementia screaming]

127
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,709
[machete whooshes]
 [flesh squelches]

128
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:05,951
[Dementia screaming]

129
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:07,159
[body thuds]
[machete clinks]

130
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,713
[Dementia screaming]
 [whooshing]

131
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:10,508
[static buzzing]

132
00:06:10,508 --> 00:06:13,338
- That was three months ago.

133
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:15,927
The last time anyone
 heard from those kids.

134
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:21,829
At first this footage was
dismissed as some kind of hoax.

135
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:24,970
Although these days
 it seems people

136
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,663
will think anything is real

137
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:30,148
if it's hyped well enough.

138
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,186
Anyway, yesterday
 a crew preparing

139
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:38,190
the property for
demolition dug up this.

140
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:41,055
They're graves.

141
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,195
And they're pretty old
 from what I can see here.

142
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:46,336
Four buddies.

143
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:50,513
They're definitely not the
 kids in that videotape.

144
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:53,827
So we need to find out
 exactly who they are.

145
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,176
Myths and urban legends aside,

146
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:04,078
your job is to get out there
 and identify those corpses.

147
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,909
The locals have their
 panties in a bunch

148
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:09,877
because they had to
 halt construction

149
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:12,259
of their new mega mall

150
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:15,573
until we can find out
 whose bodies they are

151
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:19,197
and get them properly
 buried off the site.

152
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,168
That's it, Professor Sparrow.

153
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:30,588
A few DNA tests, some
 historical research

154
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:32,141
with your students.

155
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:35,455
You're in, you're
 out, you're sleeping.

156
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,563
- Sounds like fun.

157
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,394
[hard rock music]

158
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:41,106
[birds chirping]

159
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:46,008
- [Woman] So this is home?

160
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:49,736
- For the moment, anyway.

161
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:52,014
This is home sweet home.

162
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,603
- Dibs on a room in front.

163
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:57,537
- Don't get too comfortable.

164
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,160
Remember, the rest of the team
 is joining us later tonight.

165
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,990
- Yeah, and I am not
 rooming with Clark.

166
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,545
The man snores like a buzzsaw.

167
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,547
- Well, we all make sacrifices.

168
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,480
- This house gives
 me the chills.

169
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,035
- This entire county
 gives me the chills.

170
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:15,693
[door creaking]

171
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:18,488
[crows cawing]

172
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:21,250
[ominous music]

173
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:26,289
Speaking of which,
 this guy looks

174
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:28,568
like he ate the
 long arm of the law.

175
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,949
- Behave yourself, Norman.

176
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:33,918
That's no way to speak to adults

177
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:35,540
with weapons.
 [Norman chuckles]

178
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,679
- Yes, Mother.

179
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:45,377
- Mrs. Sparrow,
 Sheriff Jake Harmon.

180
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,621
Welcome to Covington County.

181
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:48,484
- Really?

182
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:51,314
Quite the fight your
 city council put up

183
00:09:51,314 --> 00:09:53,800
to keep the university
 away from here.

184
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,320
I wasn't expecting
 such a fuzzy welcome.

185
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,392
- You didn't take any of
that personally, did ya?

186
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,672
- [chuckles] Well, it
has only been 110 years

187
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:05,777
since you people
burned your last witch.

188
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:08,608
[Jake laughs]

189
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,714
- You know, you city
 folks just kill me.

190
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:12,991
- Okay.

191
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:14,510
- Norman.

192
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,857
- [Jake] And who are these
 good looking youngsters?

193
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:18,203
Students of yours?

194
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:19,757
- Oh, yes.

195
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:21,655
This is Stephanie Zinone.

196
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:22,622
- Miss.

197
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,831
- Nice to meet you, Sheriff

198
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:28,558
- And our resident
 man on the moon here

199
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:30,595
is Norman Soderquist.

200
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:31,631
- Soderquist.

201
00:10:32,804 --> 00:10:34,772
What kind of a name is that?

202
00:10:34,772 --> 00:10:37,671
- A very difficult
 one to pronounce,

203
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:39,673
but an easy one to remember.

204
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,262
[Jake laughs]

205
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,023
- Well fine.

206
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:47,612
And about the city council,

207
00:10:47,612 --> 00:10:48,855
you have to understand,

208
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:51,789
they work hard to
 attract business

209
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:54,170
like that mall to Covington.

210
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:58,727
Means new jobs, a big
 boost to the economy.

211
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:00,487
- I understand that, Sheriff.

212
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:03,524
- Well all I want is
 those bodies out of there

213
00:11:03,524 --> 00:11:07,011
so we can get on with
 business as usual.

214
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:08,219
- Trust me, Sheriff,

215
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:10,014
we have no desire to spend

216
00:11:10,014 --> 00:11:12,706
a moment longer
 here than necessary.

217
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:14,052
- That's what I wanna hear.

218
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:17,366
Now if you folks need anything,

219
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:20,438
don't hesitate to
 give a call, okay?

220
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:22,682
- We'll put you on speed dial.

221
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,752
- Oh.

222
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:24,718
[keys jangle]

223
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,375
Here are the keys.

224
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,273
- Thank you.

225
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:29,723
- Have a nice day.

226
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,519
[ominous music]

227
00:11:36,661 --> 00:11:38,042
- I don't think
 I've ever been told

228
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,734
that I'm not
 welcome so politely.

229
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,287
[crows cawing]

230
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:46,395
- Well, we're not here to
 win any popularity contests.

231
00:11:46,395 --> 00:11:48,984
Let's just do our
 jobs and go home.

232
00:11:48,984 --> 00:11:51,469
[car starts]

233
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:58,303
- Hey, you've always
gotten along with Clark.

234
00:11:58,303 --> 00:11:59,373
Bet the two of you could spend

235
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:01,755
some real quality time together.

236
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,274
- Forget it, Soderquist.

237
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:09,349
[ominous music]

238
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,249
[doors open]

239
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:20,049
[wind whistling]

240
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:29,024
- Jeez, it's colder in
here than it is outside.

241
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:31,233
So much for that warm welcome.

242
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:35,755
You think these people ever
 heard of indoor heating?

243
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,791
I'll find the thermostat.

244
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,587
[ominous music]

245
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:42,658
- Talk about goth.

246
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,212
This is the real deal.

247
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:46,213
- [chuckles] Yeah.

248
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:48,940
If these walls could talk.

249
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:51,529
And obviously they're going to.

250
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:56,258
[doors creaking]

251
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:58,950
[ominous music]

252
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,929
- Good a place as
 any to set up shop.

253
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:25,528
- I can't believe I
 gave up a scholarship

254
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:28,635
to Oahu U for this.

255
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:31,569
I could be digging for dead
things on the beach in Waikiki.

256
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:35,435
- At least the others
 get to hide out here.

257
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:37,264
You and I have to go into town

258
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:41,268
and start stirring up the
 locals of this little hamlet.

259
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:43,063
- Unlucky us.

260
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:44,340
[doors creaking]

261
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,860
- Okay. We should
 have heat shortly.

262
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:49,932
- Thank God.

263
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,247
So how's this for office space?

264
00:13:54,247 --> 00:13:55,489
- Looks good.

265
00:13:58,561 --> 00:14:00,805
Sir, my things, please.

266
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:01,841
[keys jangling]

267
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,084
And try not to break anything.

268
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:05,430
- I'll try.

269
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,226
- [chuckles] Steph and
I will get busy in here.

270
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,989
Oh, God.

271
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:14,681
[ominous music]

272
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:19,168
- It's good having a
 man around the house.

273
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:23,034
[both chuckle]

274
00:14:23,034 --> 00:14:27,556
[ominous music]
 [insects chirping]

275
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:30,214
[Clark snoring]

276
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:51,304
- Clark.

277
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,548
Clark.

278
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,138
[Clark snoring]

279
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:00,416
Clark!

280
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,144
- Huh?

281
00:15:04,144 --> 00:15:04,973
Huh?

282
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,767
What?

283
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:09,184
- You're snoring.

284
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:11,772
- I am?

285
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,015
- Yes.

286
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:15,431
- Oh. Sorry, man.

287
00:15:15,431 --> 00:15:17,778
Getting back to sleep.

288
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:19,332
[Clark sighs]

289
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:24,337
[ominous music]
[Clark snoring]

[Norman sighs]

291
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,031
- Inconsiderate bastard.

292
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:31,033
[Norman snoring]

293
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,656
[ominous music]

00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:36,832
[footsteps thudding]

295
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:38,627
Hey.

296
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:42,113
I didn't know
 anyone else was up.

297
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:45,461
- Yeah, just catching
 up on my reading.

298
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:46,876
- Anything interesting?

299
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,225
- "The History of
 Covington County."

300
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:53,504
Courtesy of the Covington
 County Tourist Bureau.

301
00:15:53,504 --> 00:15:55,299
- Sounds gripping.

302
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:57,163
- I haven't been
 able to put it down.

303
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:01,098
Oh, juice is on the counter.

304
00:16:01,098 --> 00:16:02,927
- Oh, thanks.

305
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:07,207
Okay.

306
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:11,315
- So what's the matter?
You can't sleep?

307
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:14,076
- Oh, God. It's Clark.

308
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:17,217
If only he could use the
 power in his nasal passages

309
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:19,806
for good instead of evil.

310
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:22,015
- They burned them alive.

311
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,465
[ominous music]

312
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:24,845
- Come again.

313
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:25,674
- The witches.

314
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:28,642
It says here they used
 to burn them alive

315
00:16:28,642 --> 00:16:30,679
in the town square.

316
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,507
- Really?

317
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:34,890
- Yeah. It's actually
 here in the pamphlet.

318
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,029
Can you believe it?

319
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:40,482
They even stage reenactments.

320
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:42,760
- So the things really
 do cook around here.

321
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:48,524
[Stephanie chuckles]

322
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:51,734
- You know, I'm
starting to get the idea

323
00:16:51,734 --> 00:16:53,322
this town is a bit off.

324
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,877
- You're just now
 figuring that out.

325
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:59,604
- Sparrow told us to watch
 our step around here,

326
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:03,332
but this is really sick.

327
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:05,645
- You've never been to
 one of my family reunions.

328
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:08,096
[ominous music]

329
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:10,236
- Of course, I'm sure
 there are few sites

330
00:17:10,236 --> 00:17:12,065
around here worth checking out.

331
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:20,936
- Yeah. I'm...

332
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:21,764
I'm sure.

333
00:17:23,283 --> 00:17:24,353
- Well, good night.

334
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:26,528
I hope you get some sleep.

335
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:28,944
We've got an early day tomorrow.

336
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:30,877
[ambient music]

337
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:33,466
[door closes]

338
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,020
- I love my work.

339
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:44,615
[ominous music]

340
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:48,619
- All right guys, gather around.

341
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:55,108
This is a first
 grave we discovered

342
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:58,801
approximately 72 hours ago.

343
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:01,252
Since then, three others
have been unearthed

344
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:03,323
within a 30 yard radius.

345
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:04,807
[crows cawing]

346
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:09,295
I'm estimating their age
 at a little over 200 years.

347
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:11,262
But Angela, it's
 gonna be your job

348
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:12,194
to verify that, okay?

349
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:13,092
- You got it.

350
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:15,715
- As for the rest of us,

351
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:21,030
our primary job today
 is just to gather

352
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,448
whatever physical evidence
 we can from the scene.

353
00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:26,967
Then the remains will be exhumed

354
00:18:26,967 --> 00:18:29,038
and taken to the town mortuary

355
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:31,558
until we can find any
clues to their identity.

356
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,147
Any questions?

357
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,565
Good. Let's get to work.

358
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,913
Clark, can you give me a hand?

359
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,399
[indistinct]

360
00:18:53,097 --> 00:18:57,101
- Would you get that out
of my face, Soderquist?

361
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,105
- Come on, easy.

362
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:02,279

- I don't think we're
gonna find anything here

722
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,892
that's gonna help us.

723
00:38:31,032 --> 00:38:35,105
- Well, at least the day
wasn't a total waste.

724
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,625
- Yes, lest we forget
 that we are now

725
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:40,904
official Covington County
 Library card holders.

726
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:43,562
[both laughing]

727
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:51,052
[clock ticking]

728
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:53,710
[ominous music]

729
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:59,129
[Professor moaning]

730
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:04,031
- Oh.

731
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:06,067
Oh, my head.

732
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,175
Mm.

733
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:16,250
Oh.

734
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:21,876
Mm.

735
00:39:23,188 --> 00:39:24,016
Ow.

736
00:39:32,024 --> 00:39:34,855
[Professor sighs]

737
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:39,031
Mm.

738
00:39:40,274 --> 00:39:42,483
God, I look like shit.

739
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:45,003
Mm.

740
00:39:45,003 --> 00:39:45,935
Oh.

741
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:47,626
Mm.

742
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:50,318
[ominous music]

743
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:55,738
[pills rattling]

744
00:40:01,226 --> 00:40:02,745
[intense music]

745
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:05,644
[Professor snarls]

746
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:09,614
[birds chirping]

747
00:40:10,787 --> 00:40:14,412
[keyboard clattering]
 [machinery beeping]

748
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,447
[hands clap]

749
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:16,310
People.

750
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,658
People!

751
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,629
Today, I want DNA samples

752
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:27,183
from each of the
 remaining corpses.

753
00:40:27,183 --> 00:40:28,943
Then we will be
 returning back here

754
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:30,635
to process them ASFP.

755
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:35,087
- Is that it?

756
00:40:35,087 --> 00:40:36,744
[ominous music]

757
00:40:36,744 --> 00:40:38,263
- I'm sorry...

758
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:39,816
- It's Clark, ma'am.

759
00:40:39,816 --> 00:40:41,784
- Right, Clark.

760
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:45,857
Is there something
 about my instructions

761
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:48,376
that we're not
 crystal clear to you?

762
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,277
- No, I just thought
 it might be easier

763
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:53,830
to do a full workup

764
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:57,351
since we going to be
 there anyways, so I...

765
00:40:57,351 --> 00:40:58,283
I'm sorry, ma'am.

766
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:04,151
- Nonetheless, we are
 doing things my way.

767
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:06,153
Understood?

768
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,882
Is that understood?

769
00:41:10,882 --> 00:41:15,714
[ominous music]
 [machinery beeping]

770
00:41:15,714 --> 00:41:17,026
All right then.

771
00:41:17,026 --> 00:41:19,442
[door opens]

772
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,075
[computer beeping]

773
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:32,904
[knocking]

774
00:41:32,904 --> 00:41:34,871
- Good morning there.

775
00:41:34,871 --> 00:41:36,079
[hands slam]

776
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,530
- Well good morning, Sheriff.

777
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,222
[ominous music]

778
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:50,438
- Well just be heading out now.

779
00:41:50,438 --> 00:41:51,232
- Whatever.

780
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,516
- So sheriff, what can
I do for you this time?

781
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:03,521
- Hey now, I'm not trying to
 bust your chops, Professor.

782
00:42:04,418 --> 00:42:05,592
I'm looking for someone.

783
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:08,008
Al Wilson.

784
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:10,286
You know the fellow that
runs the funeral parlor.

785
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:15,153
I thought maybe he might
 be out here with you folks,

786
00:42:15,153 --> 00:42:16,188
for some reason.

787
00:42:17,258 --> 00:42:21,055
[Professor chuckling]

788
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,850
- You mean you have yourself

789
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:27,821
an honest to God
missing person, Sheriff.

790
00:42:27,821 --> 00:42:31,514
- Oh well, I wouldn't
exactly put it that way.

791
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:35,276
I guess he's kind of hard to
 find at the moment, s'all.

792
00:42:36,174 --> 00:42:38,072
I'm sure he'll turn up.

793
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:40,385
- Well, I don't know.

794
00:42:40,385 --> 00:42:42,732
I'd be a little
concerned if I were you.

795
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:45,563
Maybe you should
 call in the troops.

796
00:42:47,047 --> 00:42:49,739
[Jake laughing]

797
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:51,396
- That's a good one.

798
00:42:51,396 --> 00:42:52,293
You got me.

799
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:55,158
Now listen. Don't you worry.

800
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:56,677
I left one of my deputies

801
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:59,128
over there at the
 funeral parlor.

802
00:42:59,128 --> 00:42:59,956
He'll let you in.

803
00:43:02,303 --> 00:43:03,995
- Well thank you.

804
00:43:03,995 --> 00:43:05,375
And good luck.

805
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,002
You have a nice
 day now, Sheriff.

806
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:13,660
[ominous music]

807
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:19,907
[birds chirping]

808
00:43:19,907 --> 00:43:22,254
- I've never seen her
 that way before, have you?

809
00:43:22,254 --> 00:43:23,497
- No.

810
00:43:23,497 --> 00:43:26,258
It's amazing what a
 Wonderbra will do.

811
00:43:26,258 --> 00:43:28,571
[Stephanie scoffs]

812
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:30,297
- Maybe we should
 have stuck around

813
00:43:31,436 --> 00:43:32,748
- For what?

814
00:43:32,748 --> 00:43:34,508
I mean, whatever it
is, she'll work it out.

815
00:43:34,508 --> 00:43:37,373
I don't think she wants us
 nosing around in her business.

816
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:40,548
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

817
00:43:44,794 --> 00:43:48,626
You know, I finally realized
 what's been bothering me.

818
00:43:49,696 --> 00:43:52,215
- Enlighten me, please.

819
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:55,460
- Yesterday, when we
 interviewed that mortician

820
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,773
and he made the
 offhanded remark.

821
00:43:57,773 --> 00:44:00,258
You remember, about the witches?

822
00:44:00,258 --> 00:44:02,225
- Is it still bothering you?

823
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:03,364
- Yes, it is.

824
00:44:04,538 --> 00:44:06,333
- What are you getting at?

825
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:08,266
- Witch trials were
 held in this county

826
00:44:08,266 --> 00:44:11,441
up into the latter half
of the 18th century.

827
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,996
I mean, these people
are almost proud of it.

828
00:44:13,996 --> 00:44:15,066
- Yeah.

829
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:16,584
- If there were witch trials,

830
00:44:16,584 --> 00:44:20,623
surely some of them were
 found guilty and executed.

831
00:44:20,623 --> 00:44:23,315
I don't know about you, but
 I didn't see any mention

832
00:44:23,315 --> 00:44:26,008
of executions in the
records we went through.

833
00:44:27,837 --> 00:44:29,563
- You think someone's
 hiding them?

834
00:44:30,702 --> 00:44:32,393
- Someone knows the truth.

835
00:44:33,636 --> 00:44:34,464
- Okay.

836
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,777
So what's next?

837
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:43,232
- Angus Westmore.

838
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:44,923
- Ooh, the town watcher.

839
00:44:46,338 --> 00:44:49,134
- Something tells me he
 knows what's going on here.

840
00:44:49,134 --> 00:44:51,896
[birds chirping]

841
00:44:54,588 --> 00:44:56,555
[sign creaking]

842
00:44:56,555 --> 00:44:59,317
[ominous music]

843
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,910
Mr. Westmore, your family is one

844
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:07,601
of the oldest in Covington?

845
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:11,639
- My family founded this town.

846
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:12,951
[fire crackling]

847
00:45:12,951 --> 00:45:15,264
Fought and died for it.

848
00:45:16,783 --> 00:45:19,406
Protected it from
 all manner of evil.

849
00:45:21,477 --> 00:45:24,376
- [Stephanie] Would you mind
 elaborating on that, sir?

850
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:27,414
[ominous music]

851
00:45:27,414 --> 00:45:29,174
- Elaborating?

852
00:45:29,174 --> 00:45:31,729
- [Stephanie] Precisely,
 what are you referring to?

853
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:37,976
- Evil comes in many forms.

854
00:45:41,462 --> 00:45:44,155
- [Stephanie] Do you believe
 in witches, Mr. Westmore?

855
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:47,883
- [Norman] Ah, Steph, are
 you sure you wanna go there?

856
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:51,438
- [Stephanie] Do you
 believe the people executed

857
00:45:51,438 --> 00:45:55,028
over two centuries ago
 were actually witches?

858
00:45:55,028 --> 00:46:00,033
[ominous music]
[fire crackling]

859
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,344
- Some.

860
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:05,383
- [Stephanie] Some, not all?

861
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:09,525
- Sometimes the innocent

862
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:14,185
must suffer for the good of all.

863
00:46:15,427 --> 00:46:17,498
Do you really want
 to know the truth?

864
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,605
- [Stephanie] Of course we do.

865
00:46:20,605 --> 00:46:23,401
- Understand that once
 you hear the truth,

866
00:46:23,401 --> 00:46:24,885
you can't hide from it.

867
00:46:26,438 --> 00:46:29,510
You'll share in the guilt
 with the rest of us.

868
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:31,443
- [Stephanie] If you know
 something that can help us,

869
00:46:31,443 --> 00:46:33,307
you have to say something.

870
00:46:33,307 --> 00:46:35,240
[fire crackling]

871
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,001
Very well.

872
00:46:37,001 --> 00:46:39,244
[ominous music]

873
00:46:39,244 --> 00:46:42,006
It began in the year
 of our Lord, 1826.

874
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:48,460
That fall, a young
 soldier returned

875
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,669
to Covington from California.

876
00:46:52,982 --> 00:46:55,122
He brought with him
 a terrible sickness.

877
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,023
It spread quickly
 and spared no one.

878
00:47:01,577 --> 00:47:04,166
A physician was
 someone from Boston

879
00:47:04,166 --> 00:47:05,892
but he could do nothing.

880
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:12,105
Finally, in a moment
 of utter desperation,

881
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,386
the town elders approached
 a coven of witches

882
00:47:17,386 --> 00:47:18,836
who were condemned to death.

883
00:47:20,665 --> 00:47:23,806
Driven by fear,
 the elders entered

884
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:28,811
into an unholy bargain
 with these evil creatures.

885
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:33,436
In exchange for
 ending the sickness,

886
00:47:34,368 --> 00:47:36,405
it was agreed that the witches

887
00:47:36,405 --> 00:47:39,684
would be granted
clemency for their sins.

888
00:47:39,684 --> 00:47:41,375
[ominous music]
[fire crackling]

889
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:45,103
Their lives would be spared.

890
00:47:46,518 --> 00:47:48,900
They were led by Lilith LeFay.

891
00:47:50,937 --> 00:47:51,799
Beautiful.

892
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,424
Wicked.

893
00:47:55,424 --> 00:47:58,668
[ominous music]
[fire crackling]

894
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:01,050
She led her covenant
 to the forest

895
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,741
and there tey kept their word.

896
00:48:04,226 --> 00:48:06,124
The sickness vanished.

897
00:48:09,541 --> 00:48:12,717
The doomed rose from
 their death beds.

898
00:48:16,376 --> 00:48:18,274
- [Stephanie] What
 happened to Lilith?

899
00:48:18,274 --> 00:48:21,070
[ominous music]
[fire crackling]

900
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:24,729
- She and her coven
 were betrayed.

901
00:48:24,729 --> 00:48:26,213
- [Stephanie] How?

902
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:33,117
- The elders began to
regret the ungodly pact

903
00:48:33,117 --> 00:48:36,258
they entered into.

904
00:48:36,258 --> 00:48:39,778
They to sent a team of witch
 hunters into the forest

905
00:48:39,778 --> 00:48:42,229
to kill Lilith and her circle.

906
00:48:45,301 --> 00:48:47,476
The witches were drowned.

907
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,721
Their bodies buried.

908
00:48:54,862 --> 00:48:58,763
The earth was scrubbed
 with salt to ensure

909
00:48:58,763 --> 00:49:00,627
they would never arise again.

910
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,117
May God forgive us.

911
00:49:08,117 --> 00:49:09,947
- Are you saying
 that those bodies,

912
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,984
the ones we dug up,

913
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:16,367
that those are the bodies
 of Lilith and her coven?

914
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:19,646
- You asked for
 the truth, my dear!

915
00:49:19,646 --> 00:49:24,651
[ominous music]
[fire crackling]

916
00:49:25,376 --> 00:49:26,480
And the question is,

917
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:33,694
do you believe in witches?

918
00:49:33,694 --> 00:49:36,352
[ominous music]

919
00:49:39,873 --> 00:49:42,634
[fire crackling]

920
00:49:54,888 --> 00:49:57,615
[doors closing]

921
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,969
- Okay, what do you
 make of all that?

922
00:50:07,935 --> 00:50:10,145
- I think the man's a nut loaf.

923
00:50:10,145 --> 00:50:11,353
[Stephanie sighs]

924
00:50:11,353 --> 00:50:13,217
He sort of reminds
 me of someone.

925
00:50:13,217 --> 00:50:15,219
- But do you believe his story?

926
00:50:16,565 --> 00:50:18,912
- I'm able to believe
 anything in this town.

927
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,811
But hey, I'm only a tourist.

928
00:50:22,881 --> 00:50:25,470
- That's right. You are.

929
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:28,611
What we need is the
 opinion of people.

930
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:30,234
[static buzzing]

931
00:50:30,234 --> 00:50:31,821
- Sir, hi.

932
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:33,651
I was wondering if I
 could ask you a couple

933
00:50:33,651 --> 00:50:35,411
of questions about
 those grave sites

934
00:50:35,411 --> 00:50:37,172
they found outside of town?

935
00:50:37,172 --> 00:50:40,071
- [chuckles] Grave sites give
 me the, ooh, the willies.

936
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:41,038
- I think I read something

937
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,419
in the Metro section about that.

938
00:50:43,419 --> 00:50:44,938
- See a lot of tourists
coming to this town.

939
00:50:44,938 --> 00:50:47,113
They stop me like you do

940
00:50:47,113 --> 00:50:50,806
and ask me questions because
 I got the late shift.

941
00:50:50,806 --> 00:50:52,704
- [Stephanie] Sir, can I
 have a moment of your time?

942
00:50:52,704 --> 00:50:53,498
- I really don't have time.

943
00:50:54,603 --> 00:50:56,501
- Nothing ever
 happens in this town.

944
00:50:56,501 --> 00:50:58,814
I mean, if something
 happened here,

945
00:50:58,814 --> 00:51:01,023
I wouldn't have to read
comic books all the time

946
00:51:01,023 --> 00:51:03,853
to to get something
 to happen for me.

947
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:05,855
- You don't wanna
 go in the woods.

948
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,065
The woods, they'll kill you.

949
00:51:09,238 --> 00:51:11,240
- The first time I got
laid was in those woods.

950
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,448
- We're not from here.

951
00:51:12,448 --> 00:51:13,725
We're just visiting.

952
00:51:13,725 --> 00:51:14,761
- I'm from Buffalo.

953
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:18,937
- This area has a
history of peculiarness

954
00:51:20,836 --> 00:51:23,632
but that breeds mystery.

955
00:51:23,632 --> 00:51:26,704
- I'll tell you that I
 will never go back again.

956
00:51:26,704 --> 00:51:28,430
And it's got nothing
 to do with the girl

957
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,362
that I was with.

958
00:51:29,362 --> 00:51:30,639
- And we were cleaning the woods

959
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:33,849
and we were all kind of
high and stoned and...

960
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:37,577
- When I was finished, I felt
 this, I can't describe it.

961
00:51:37,577 --> 00:51:40,718
This weird cold sweat
 thing that happened.

962
00:51:40,718 --> 00:51:42,029
- [Stephanie] What about
 the kids that are missing?

963
00:51:42,029 --> 00:51:44,998
- I said, I don't
 have time, okay?

964
00:51:44,998 --> 00:51:48,898
- I know the father
 of one of the girls

965
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:50,693
and he's upset.

966
00:51:50,693 --> 00:51:52,316
- The kids?

967
00:51:52,316 --> 00:51:54,283
Screw those kids.

968
00:51:54,283 --> 00:51:56,320
- [Stephanie] So do you think
 those kids were punished

969
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,356
in some sort of way?

970
00:51:58,356 --> 00:51:59,323
- Probably.

971
00:51:59,323 --> 00:52:00,841
Maybe they were some of the kids

972
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:02,912
who made fun of me and now maybe

973
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:05,639
they went out in the woods
 and something got 'em.

974
00:52:05,639 --> 00:52:09,022
And good is what I say to that.

975
00:52:09,022 --> 00:52:11,128
- Well I haven't read that
 there was a connection

976
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,853
between the bodies they found

977
00:52:12,853 --> 00:52:14,131
and the kids that were missing

978
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,823
in terms of identification
 or anything.

979
00:52:16,823 --> 00:52:17,927
- [Stephanie] What
 can you tell me about

980
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:20,447
the old house by the woods?

981
00:52:20,447 --> 00:52:22,000
- The witch house?

982
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,761
- Oh, that house, it's haunted.

983
00:52:24,796 --> 00:52:25,625
Oh yeah.

984
00:52:26,557 --> 00:52:28,317
'Cause I believe in it.

985
00:52:28,317 --> 00:52:30,147
- I've been up at
 that place before.

986
00:52:31,838 --> 00:52:33,219
Been inside.

987
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:37,119
- Deserted houses get
 reputations as being haunted.

988
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,017
- [Stephanie] What
 was it like inside?

989
00:52:39,017 --> 00:52:40,226
- Place is real strange.

990
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:43,643
When we got in, it was
 all dusty and dark.

991
00:52:43,643 --> 00:52:45,679
And when I got in there,
I was walking around.

992
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:47,923
I heard, sounded
 like this old woman

993
00:52:47,923 --> 00:52:50,408
or something was
 laughing and stuff.

994
00:52:50,408 --> 00:52:55,033
Candle blew out, the door
 of the room slammed shut.

995
00:52:55,033 --> 00:52:56,000
- You know what?

996
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,691
One time, my friend, Tommy,

997
00:52:57,691 --> 00:53:01,074
who he was my friend and we
would buy comic books together,

998
00:53:01,074 --> 00:53:03,249
but he moved to Portland.

999
00:53:03,249 --> 00:53:05,320
He went up to the house.

1000
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,769
Some other kids dared him.

1001
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:08,081
I told him not to go.

1002
00:53:08,081 --> 00:53:09,634
I stayed back and watched.

1003
00:53:09,634 --> 00:53:13,707
- This cold hand
like touched me.

1004
00:53:13,707 --> 00:53:16,193
- He went up and he
 touched the door knob

1005
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,402
and he got a bloody nose.

1006
00:53:18,402 --> 00:53:20,197
- [Stephanie] So you think
 you got a bloody nose

1007
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,508
because of the witches?

1008
00:53:21,508 --> 00:53:23,200
- Well, he was a bleeder.

1009
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,823
- I've read records
 that in fact,

1010
00:53:25,823 --> 00:53:27,445
the house was burned years ago

1011
00:53:27,445 --> 00:53:29,378
and this is another
 house entirely.

1012
00:53:29,378 --> 00:53:31,760
- And I stay away. You know why?

1013
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,520
'Cause I'm a security guard.

1014
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,971
- No, you're not
supposed to say our name

1015
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:37,800
because that makes
 her aware of you

1016
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,734
and then that can
 make you a target.

1017
00:53:40,734 --> 00:53:42,805
- [Stephanie] Have you
 ever heard of Lilith LaFey?

1018
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:46,602
- That's biblical, isn't it or?

1019
00:53:47,983 --> 00:53:49,916
- [Stephanie] Are you
 talking about Lilith LaFey?

1020
00:53:49,916 --> 00:53:52,746
- Right, now you said
 her name and now,

1021
00:53:52,746 --> 00:53:54,507
okay, now that we've said it,

1022
00:53:54,507 --> 00:53:56,543
I guess we gotta talk about her.

1023
00:53:56,543 --> 00:53:58,373
- That name sounds familiar.

1024
00:53:58,373 --> 00:54:00,754
- Yeah, I think we saw
 them at Lilith Fair.

1025
00:54:00,754 --> 00:54:02,480
- I don't know
 anything about him.

1026
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,207
- Lilith LaFey fucking rock!

1027
00:54:05,207 --> 00:54:06,829
- Oh yeah, she's
that goth chick.

1028
00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:08,141
I think she's in 7 Months.

1029
00:54:08,141 --> 00:54:09,660
- Yeah.
- Yeah,

1030
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,352
well a lot of tourists come
 in and ask me about Lilith.

1031
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:14,216
I'm not scared of Lilith.

1032
00:54:14,216 --> 00:54:15,666
- They have that song, you know?

1033
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:18,565
♪ Yeah, I wanna
 rock your world ♪

1034
00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:20,878
It's so cool.

1035
00:54:20,878 --> 00:54:24,261
- [Stephanie] So is
 Lilith an old wives' tale?

1036
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,918
Can you go into the woods,
 say her name three times

1037
00:54:26,918 --> 00:54:28,541
and she'll appear?

1038
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:31,060
- You know, I wouldn't
 even say at once.

1039
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,753
Three times is
 asking for trouble.

1040
00:54:33,753 --> 00:54:36,238
- I believe in certain
 paranormal stuff.

1041
00:54:36,238 --> 00:54:38,620
Yeah, I mean, I read, you know.

1042
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:41,381
I see the "Psi Factor"
 and all that stuff.

1043
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:43,418
- I mean, you know,
Lilith's not that tough,

1044
00:54:43,418 --> 00:54:46,524
but I mean, she's
killed a lot of people.

1045
00:54:46,524 --> 00:54:49,389
- People hear about
 murders and witches

1046
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:52,841
and then they, well you
wanna go investigate?

1047
00:54:52,841 --> 00:54:55,706
I would investigate travel,

1048
00:54:55,706 --> 00:54:58,329
a plane ticket somewhere else.

1049
00:54:58,329 --> 00:54:59,330
- They existed.

1050
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:02,747
There's historical record of it.

1051
00:55:02,747 --> 00:55:04,577
- No, but I believe in bitches.

1052
00:55:04,577 --> 00:55:06,475
I've dated a lot of 'em.

1053
00:55:06,475 --> 00:55:08,684
- Whether they were
 evil or not, you know,

1054
00:55:08,684 --> 00:55:10,410
that's a matter of opinion.

1055
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:11,894
- There's gotta
 be validity in it.

1056
00:55:11,894 --> 00:55:13,965
Otherwise, why do
 we keep repeating

1057
00:55:13,965 --> 00:55:16,071
the same legends and
 stories over again?

1058
00:55:16,968 --> 00:55:18,453
- I don't need to say anymore.

1059
00:55:20,869 --> 00:55:22,249
- I gotta go.

1060
00:55:22,249 --> 00:55:23,078
- Thank you.

The witch house?

1067
00:55:47,689 --> 00:55:50,795
- Well at least now we know
 why they're tearing it down.

1068
00:55:50,795 --> 00:55:53,695
- Only happened to be the
 site of a mass murder.

1069
00:55:55,179 --> 00:55:57,354
- I wonder if the city has it
 on their tourist information?

Maybe we could
 write them a letter.

- [chuckles] God.

1073
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:05,569
[sighs] So where
 do we go from here?

1074
00:56:06,535 --> 00:56:08,088
- Well, I am not looking forward

1075
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:10,125
to facing Sparrow
 with just a handful

1076
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:12,541

00:56:12,541 --> 00:56:16,027
- She did say to tell her
 about anything we found.

1078
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,824
Let's just hope they're
 having more luck than we are.

1079
00:56:22,137 --> 00:56:24,346
[van starts]

1080
00:56:24,346 --> 00:56:27,314
- Back to the slaughterhouse.

1081

[distorted whispering]
 [insects chirping]

1082

[intense music]
 [distorted whispering]

1084
00:56:48,128 --> 00:56:49,820
- Soon, my acolytes.

1085
00:56:51,684 --> 00:56:53,030
Soon.

1086
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,688
[intense music]

1087
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:05,456

[Clark sighs]

1092
00:57:40,111 --> 00:57:41,250
- Professor?

1093
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:43,908
What are you doing?

1094
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,604
- I wanted to apologize for
 my behavior this morning.

1095
00:57:50,743 --> 00:57:52,434
I was out of line.

1096
00:57:52,434 --> 00:57:54,816
- Um, that's all right.

1097
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:58,475
- Oh, but it's not all right.

1098
00:57:59,614 --> 00:58:01,201
I wanna make it up to you.

1099
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:05,343
- Make it up to me?

1100
00:58:05,343 --> 00:58:06,275
- Mm-hmm.

1101
00:58:07,414 --> 00:58:08,795
I have a gift for you.

1102
00:58:09,934 --> 00:58:12,523
- Oh no, I don't
 think this is such a

1103
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,526
good idea.

1104
00:58:16,907 --> 00:58:19,047
- You do like me, don't you?

1105
00:58:20,151 --> 00:58:23,189
Because I don't
 handle rejection well.

1106
00:58:23,189 --> 00:58:24,431
[ominous music]

1107
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:27,193
- There is something
about me you don't know.

1108
00:58:28,194 --> 00:58:31,162
[tongue slurping]

1109
00:58:31,162 --> 00:58:32,163
- What's that?

1110
00:58:33,164 --> 00:58:33,993
- I'm gay.

1111
00:58:36,443 --> 00:58:37,583
- That's okay.

1112
00:58:38,825 --> 00:58:41,138
I have something else in mind.

1113
00:58:41,138 --> 00:58:44,072
[intense music]

1114
00:58:44,072 --> 00:58:48,835
[flesh squelches]
 [Clark screaming]

1115
00:58:48,835 --> 00:58:50,078
Don't fight it.

1116
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:52,321
Relax.

1117
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:53,668
[Clark screaming]

1118
00:58:53,668 --> 00:58:55,290
It's easier that way.

1121
00:59:36,227 --> 00:59:37,297
Welcome back.

1122
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:43,510
We've got work to do, my friend.

1123
00:59:55,764 --> 00:59:58,595
[floor creaking]

1124
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,459
- Angela?

1125
01:00:03,565 --> 01:00:05,429
Angela?

1126
01:00:05,429 --> 01:00:06,430
Did you hear that?

1127
01:00:08,156 --> 01:00:09,260
- Hear what?

1128
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:14,300
- It sounded like someone
 was walking above us.

1129
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:16,129
- The attic?

1130
01:00:16,129 --> 01:00:19,063
What would anybody
 be doing that for?

1131
01:00:19,063 --> 01:00:19,926
- I don't know.

1132
01:00:21,756 --> 01:00:25,242
- You know, you're
probably just dreaming.

1133
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:27,175
- I don't think so.

1134
01:00:27,175 --> 01:00:29,349
- [sighs] Look, believe me.

1135
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:31,628
It's your imagination,
 all right?

1136
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,561
Now go back to sleep.

1137
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:38,807
- I think I'll
 have a look around.

1138
01:00:38,807 --> 01:00:41,361
- Fine, let me sleep.

1139
01:00:42,604 --> 01:00:43,467
- Fine.

1140
01:00:48,541 --> 01:00:50,681

1146
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:26,950
Wow.

1147
01:02:30,677 --> 01:02:35,130
Mm. [chuckling]

1148
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:38,237
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1149
01:02:38,237 --> 01:02:41,274
[Jodi laughing]

1150
01:02:41,274 --> 01:02:43,483
Oh you, girl.

1151
01:02:43,483 --> 01:02:45,451
You have got it going on.

1152
01:02:46,866 --> 01:02:49,524
[Jodi humming]

1155
01:02:56,634 --> 01:02:58,257
Dammit, come out of there.

1156
01:03:00,293 --> 01:03:02,882
I'm warning you.

1157
01:03:02,882 --> 01:03:06,092
I'll scream, "Rape."

1158
01:03:06,092 --> 01:03:08,681
[body convulsing]
 [intense music]

1159

[Jodi gasping]

1160
01:03:12,409 --> 01:03:14,445
- "Vanity," says the preacher.

1165
01:03:41,921 --> 01:03:43,233
- Jodi?

[door creaking]

1167
01:03:48,238 --> 01:03:50,378
Jodi, what's going on?

Clark?

1174
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:19,821
Shit.

1175
01:04:19,821 --> 01:04:21,374
Where is everybody?

Jodi?

1179
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:53,890
Clark?

1180
01:04:58,342 --> 01:05:00,034
Professor Sparrow?

1181
01:05:02,795 --> 01:05:03,623
Satan?

1182
01:05:06,005 --> 01:05:07,179
Anybody?

1183
01:05:09,112 --> 01:05:12,115
[suspenseful music]

1184
01:05:13,806 --> 01:05:16,360

[doors closing]

1189
01:05:54,157 --> 01:05:57,850
- [sighs] Home sweet home.

1190
01:05:57,850 --> 01:05:58,955
- [Stephanie] At least
 they could have left

1191
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:00,577
a light on for us.

1192
01:06:00,577 --> 01:06:02,268
- Yeah, Motel 6 this ain't.

1193
01:06:03,718 --> 01:06:05,720
At least we don't have to
 face the professor tonight.

1194
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,930
[Angela chuckles and sighs]

1195
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:11,346
Look, somebody cares.

1196
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:13,831
- I am so glad to see you guys.

1197
01:06:13,831 --> 01:06:14,971
- [Stephanie] Well
 what's the matter?

1198
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,008
- [sighs] Well, let's
 put it this way.

1199
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:20,942
If I was in one of those
lame slasher movies,

1200
01:06:20,942 --> 01:06:22,909
I would be so dead right now.

1201
01:06:22,909 --> 01:06:25,498
- [chuckling] What
 are you talking about?

1202
01:06:25,498 --> 01:06:26,913
- I can't find anybody.

1203
01:06:28,225 --> 01:06:30,607
Jodi said she heard something
 upstairs in the attic,

1204
01:06:30,607 --> 01:06:32,919
so she went up there
 to go check it out.

1205
01:06:32,919 --> 01:06:36,095
But now everybody
 else has gone too.

1206
01:06:36,095 --> 01:06:38,477
Oh, and some idiot
 decides he's gonna

1207
01:06:38,477 --> 01:06:40,755
turn the stupid power off.

1208
01:06:40,755 --> 01:06:42,481
- Maybe we should
 check the kitchen

1209
01:06:42,481 --> 01:06:44,241
and see if any of the
 knives are missing.

1210
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:46,278
[both chuckling]
- Ha, ha.

1211
01:06:46,278 --> 01:06:48,142
I was gonna go check
 up in the attic,

1212
01:06:48,142 --> 01:06:50,523
but then I heard
 you guys pull up.

1213
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:55,356
- Let's get inside and
tell 'em the jig is up.

1214
01:06:55,356 --> 01:06:56,667
- Well we'll need a light.

1215
01:06:57,806 --> 01:06:59,429
- We can use the light
 on the camcorder.

1216
01:06:59,429 --> 01:07:01,155
Norman?
- Okay.

1217
01:07:11,303 --> 01:07:13,512
Let there be light.

1218
01:07:13,512 --> 01:07:16,204
I guess God is a
woman after all.

1219
01:07:16,204 --> 01:07:17,171
- That'll work.

1220
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:17,999
Everybody ready?

1221
01:07:19,311 --> 01:07:20,829
- Ready as we'll never be.

1222
01:07:25,386 --> 01:07:28,044
[door creaking]

1223
01:07:36,466 --> 01:07:38,468
[door closes]

1224
01:07:38,468 --> 01:07:40,953
- [Stephanie] Did anything
 unusual happen today?

1225
01:07:42,299 --> 01:07:45,440
- No, not unless you wanna count

1226
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,201
the professor's shitty attitude.

1227
01:07:48,892 --> 01:07:50,411
- That was pretty unusual.

1228
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:51,239
- Yeah.

1229
01:07:52,171 --> 01:07:54,725
You know what she did, you guys?

1230
01:07:54,725 --> 01:07:57,970
She totally locked us
 all out of the lab.

1231
01:07:57,970 --> 01:08:01,180
I was working there up
 until everyone went to bed.

1232
01:08:03,769 --> 01:08:04,873
- No one talked to her?

1233
01:08:04,873 --> 01:08:06,082
- No.

1234
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,222
She said she didn't
 vant to be disturbed.

1235
01:08:08,222 --> 01:08:10,155
- [chuckles] She seemed like
 - Ooh.

1236
01:08:10,155 --> 01:08:11,397
- [Norman] an innocent professor

1237
01:08:11,397 --> 01:08:12,571
but little did they know

1238
01:08:12,571 --> 01:08:14,987
that she was really
 Satan, uh-huh.

1239
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:25,860
- [Stephanie] Norman, over here.

1240
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:30,347
It's empty.

1241
01:08:30,347 --> 01:08:32,591
- Wait, that can't be right.

1242
01:08:33,902 --> 01:08:34,903
- [Stephanie] What
 happened to the new samples

1243
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:36,215
you and Clark took today?

1244
01:08:37,699 --> 01:08:41,220
- I don't know. I mean, I
 gave 'em to Professor Sparrow.

1245
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:42,532
- [Norman] You know, I
can't believe I'm about

1246
01:08:42,532 --> 01:08:43,740
to make this suggestion,

1247
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:45,293
but now might be a good time

1248
01:08:45,293 --> 01:08:47,606
to give our friend
 Sheriff Creepy a call.

1249
01:08:53,543 --> 01:08:56,339
[rotary dial clattering]

1250
01:08:56,339 --> 01:08:58,824
[line clicking] Okay, this
 is the part where you tell us

1251
01:08:58,824 --> 01:09:00,895
that the phone is dead.

1252
01:09:00,895 --> 01:09:03,069
- What, it's dead?
 [phone clacks]

1253
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:04,899
- Next question.
- Can I see

1254
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:07,902
a show of hands for
 staying in motel tonight?

1255
01:09:07,902 --> 01:09:08,730
