He saw them as inferior to us.

410

you back to Atlantis.

It's far more complicated
than that, Arthur Curry.

When she was very young,
your mother met and fell
in love with your father.

in your birth.

<i>your father nor raise</i>
<i>a halfling child.</i>

<i>Heartbroken, she returned
to lead her people.</i>

But she never stopped
loving you or your father.

437

Now she needs your help.

438
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,244

you are our future
