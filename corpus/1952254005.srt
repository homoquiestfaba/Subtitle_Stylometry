[birds chirping]

00:00:29,095 --> 00:02:03,985
[somber piano music]

4
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,055
Hey.

5
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:14,623
Daniel.

6
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,362
I'm leaving.

7
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,835
Okay, I'll drive you to the
airport.

8
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,429
No, no, no, I called a cab.

9
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,701
I thought you said you
wanted me to drive you...

10
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,402
No, I changed my mind.

11
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,136
But didn't you say....

12
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,509
No.

13
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,572
Danny.

14
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,881
I want you to think about
what I said last night.

15
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,386
You know what I want.

16
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,321
[phone ringing]

17
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,688
Thanks, thanks, I'll be right
out.

18
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,425
I can't think right now.

19
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,057
Danny.

20
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,729
Hey, you know I love you.

21
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,597
You're going to have to think
about that sometime.

22
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,839
Sometime is coming up.

23
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,178
Happy birthday.

24
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,085
Oh man, hey wait.

25
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,718
Thanks for remembering.

26
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,157
Sure.

27
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,222
I like the new chair.

28
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,324
Yeah, it's good.

29
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,734
It's much more visual than
the last one.

30
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:25,293
Think so?

31
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,430
Yeah.

32
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,308
Not very
comfortable though.

33
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,712
Yeah, visually it didn't work with
the cushions.

34
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:39,184
Looks great, sucks to sit on.

35
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,986
I'm representing the firm
for the Athens job,

36
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:49,051
Charlie told me that I might have to meet
with Bob at the architectural site,

37
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,289
they need expertise on the
architectural structural system

38
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,856
so I might be a little
longer than usual.

39
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,028
If I go to Sydney I'll give
you a call okay?

40
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,005
Let you know when
I'm coming back.

41
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,536
Wait.

42
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,706
We'll talk when I
get back, okay?

43
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,917
But Rusty I'm really, really
tired of living in a hotel.

44
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,680
It's the Tropical!

45
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,620
Janice Joplin died here;
it's like the hottest hotel in Hollywood.

46
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,921
Yes, but I want something
more permanent.

47
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,463
Say hi to Bob for me.

48
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,434
Yeah.

49
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,291
This one is May 1936.

50
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,727
Well that's good,
but not good enough.

51
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:02,200
Has to be 1935
and July please.

52
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,377
I've got it, June 1935.

53
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:15,812
June?

54
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,442
June's good, I
could approve June.

55
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,009
It's a month before
the house was finished.

56
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:22,813
Let's see.

57
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,789
Color is good!

58
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:30,727
Design is good,
texture is good...

59
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,462
uh, oh, what's this?

60
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,023
What?

61
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,261
Do you see it?

62
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,668
Look, there's a crack.

63
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,261
Yes!

64
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,603
Fuck!

65
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:43,731
Keep looking.

66
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,674
You can't even see it!

67
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,211
Garret it has to
be perfect, okay,

68
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,678
you can't put your name on
something unless it's absolutely

69
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,080
perfect, we just have to
keep looking that's all.

70
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,777
Rusty I need a minute.

71
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,786
Sorry, still looking.

72
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,483
Rusty, we'll find a sink okay,
can we have a minute please?

73
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,116
How are we supposed to
find a sink if we're talking?

74
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,217
This is serious.

75
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,921
I got a call from the
Howell's last night.

76
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:03,757
What?

77
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,388
They're not upset
about the house I hope.

78
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,433
The house is perfect, they can
not be upset about the house.

79
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,489
They love your work.

80
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:08,829
Okay.

81
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,562
And that's the thing, they
want you to design a house

82
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,604
for their daughter.

83
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,663
Did they find another
Frank Lloyd Wright to restore?

84
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,006
No, they want you to design this
one from the ground up and I

85
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:21,137
told them it's the chance
you've been waiting for.

86
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,081
They're nightmare
clients, nightmare clients.

87
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,583
I thought I was going to have a
nervous breakdown in the last

88
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,948
house I did for them.

89
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,577
You think you're going to have
a nervous breakdown on every

90
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,746
project we do.

91
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,154
What about the noitra, I mean
I've spent three years of my

92
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,522
life on this project.

93
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,618
You said I should put my
whole life into this project.

94
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,720
Rusty listen to me, I think that
we need to get you moving past

95
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,697
the (inaudible)
restorations, okay,

96
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,200
I mean people are starting to
think that that's all you do.

97
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,395
I got a call from a Russian
magazine last week

98
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,698
about your last restoration.

99
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,534
Magazine, Russia?

100
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,439
Yeah, Russia and I think
they want to do an interview.

101
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,339
Russian magazine?

102
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,502
Rusty I don't think
it's a good idea,

103
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,569
I think it will only perpetuate
the whole restoration thing and

104
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:56,478
not showcase your
design work.

105
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,675
Should I do an
interview in the magazine?

106
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,583
Rusty the point is even people
in Siberia only think that you

107
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,518
do restorations, okay.

108
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,647
I mean you need to break
out, make some other kind of

109
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,749
statement, move
towards your own creativity.

110
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,986
I don't want to
make a new statement,

111
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,493
I like this statement, I want
to make this statement over

112
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,290
and over again.

113
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,921
I'm about refinement,
I'm a perfectionist,

114
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,863
I've looked at 200
sinks for this job alone!

115
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,094
The house is for
their daughter, okay.

116
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,137
It's her wedding present.

117
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,638
I mean it's on a mountain
top in the desert!

118
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,571
You're going to build a
house from the ground up,

119
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,303
I want you to be creative okay!

120
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:28,837
And, and, and you're talking to the
Howell's this afternoon, for us!

121
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,212
So you had this
planned all along?

122
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,944
Yeah, you're damn right I did
buddy because I'm the master

123
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,418
planner and you're the
master designer and,

124
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,456
and, you're the
greatest partner in the world,

125
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,491
I just want you to
fuckingg grow.

126
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,389
I don't want to grow.

127
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,156
Well you're going to
grow starting right now.

128
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,526
You know this is in
your best interest!

129
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:45,655
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

130
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:46,993
You're such a
fuckingg bastard.

131
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,057
You're an asshole.

132
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,530
You're what?

133
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,195
I'm assigning Rusty
to a new project.

134
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,398
But Rusty is doing my house.

135
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,203
Yes, and it's almost finished.

136
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,573
I'm taking over, I'm going
to handle all the details.

137
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,077
ls this your idea Rusty?

138
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,636
This is my idea actually.

139
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,478
Rusty is going to be designing
a house from the ground up.

140
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,950
He's moving past restorations.

141
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,453
What restorations?

142
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,615
I spent five million
dollars on this property,

143
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,285
now it's just a restoration?

144
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,761
I didn't say that, l
didn't say anything like that.

145
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,231
We spent every weekend looking
for vintage plumbing Rusty.

146
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,236
We even flew to the
Philippines to look at veneers.

147
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,296
And now you're just
dumping me for some new project.

148
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:29,136
I didn't dump you guys.

149
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:33,235
I'll be taking over the completion
aspect of the project.

150
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,507
ls this what you want Rusty?

151
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,879
Well I mean he is the boss.

152
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,513
I'm not the boss, I'm Rusty's
business partner and the house

153
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:48,526
is almost complete
and Rusty is moving on.

154
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,528
Like hell he is!

155
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,893
I'm calling my
lawyers right now,

156
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,364
I'll see both of you in court.

157
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,670
I thought that went well.

158
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,677
Good, good...

159
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,606
Well, we're going
to the Howell's now,

160
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,116
so we'll get back.

161
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:16,047
So tell Rusty about the site.

162
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:20,559
Yes, um, we called Garrett
to see if we could get you to

163
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,186
design a house for our
daughter on some land

164
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,059
we have up in Mullholland.

165
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,622
Yeah, well of course l
would have to see the property,

166
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,261
you know feel it out,
get an idea of the land.

167
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,635
Mother bought it years ago,
I haven't done much with it.

168
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:37,164
lt's about ten acres.

169
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,637
Ten acres, my God
on Mulholland.

170
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,112
More or less.

171
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,708
lt's some pretty spectacular
views if I say so myself.

172
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:50,313
Mr. Price, well Rusty,
if I can call you Rusty.

173
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,153
Oh, of course, I think I spent
about two years trying to get

174
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,625
you to call me
Rusty, Mrs. Howell.

175
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,127
Elaine.

176
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,225
Elaine.

177
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:00,527
The thing is Rusty that we're
so pleased with what you did,

178
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,366
we just wanted to give the
same pleasure to Brookie.

179
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,769
Uh huh.

180
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:13,176
You see Rusty what she
means-- what we mean is well,

181
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:17,409
turns out there's this
Gio Ponti up in the hills.

182
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:23,581
lt's unpublished and it's
unknown as well as untouched

183
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:28,252
and has been perfectly maintained
by the original builders.

184
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:30,386
Heard about it this
morning when I was playing golf.

185
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:35,230
And, um, well Rusty, we traded.

186
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:41,166
About 15 minutes before
you got here.

187
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,798
You would love it Rusty.

188
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:47,335
lt's got all the original furniture
that was built for the house.

189
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,405
lt was built by Venezuelan
copper magnet for his wife in

190
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:55,284
1955, she wanted to
be a film actress.

191
00:10:55,655 --> 00:11:00,991
So you guys aren't
actually building anything?

192
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,518
That's right my boy,
we're giving her the Ponti.

193
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,292
The Gio Ponti.

194
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:09,459
We just went right ahead and
did the deed over martinis.

195
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:13,904
Beautiful, perfect.

196
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,708
That's great.

197
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,209
Our Two Architects.

198
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,953
Yeah.

199
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,927
Okay.

200
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,464
Okay, I'll call you later.

201
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,898
Rusty!

202
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,427
Look, I'm really
sorry, okay I didn't know.

203
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,202
I didn't know!

204
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:11,056
I mean, who trades
properties, right?

205
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:21,236
l've got some more news.

206
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:26,071
Being sued over the noitra.

207
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:30,070
Just got a call
from our lawyers.

208
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:38,145
Look Rusty, I'm
really sorry, l, l...

209
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,489
I didn't know!

210
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,702
Excuse me, do you have anything
stronger here than beer?

211
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,011
We have wine in
the case over there.

212
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,948
Could you help me find
it, I didn't see it.

213
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,146
You know why don't
you keep looking,

214
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,654
we're open all day.

215
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,122
Hey!

216
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,558
Would you get the man
his wine!

217
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,028
Do you want some wine?

218
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:22,757
Actually I want a dry martini, but
I don't think he'll get it for me.

219
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,867
Let me show you the
wine, it's over here.

220
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,879
Give me the keys.

221
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,580
What?

222
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,249
The keys, give me the keys.

223
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,490
Where am I going to sit!?

224
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,828
A taxi.

225
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,692
Nice.

226
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,532
I'm Denny.

227
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,968
I know you from somewhere.

228
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,868
Where?

229
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,468
You're a porn star aren't you?

230
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,240
I knew it when you
walked in and I thought,

231
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:58,078
that's what I want.

232
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,276
Aporn star.

233
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,718
I knew I wanted you
when I first saw you.

234
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,796
I'm positive.

235
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,765
Yeah?

236
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:20,736
I'm not worried though.

237
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,468
I'm going to cure it.

238
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,670
I'm going to find a way.

239
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:33,913
I'm going to create a system, my body
is going to metamorphis AlDS away.

240
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,056
Fuck me.

241
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,756
I want you to fuck me.

242
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,136
I have to get a condom.

243
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:57,141
I have some.

244
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:07,183
Can I stay with you
for a couple of days?

245
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,802
Hey.

246
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,532
Hey handsome.

247
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,765
You're awake.

248
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,679
Hey are you part Asian?

249
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,480
Pure English.

250
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:50,852
You look kind of
Asian when you're asleep.

251
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,448
You're watching me sleep?

252
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,356
Yeah, first time I made it
was with a Hawaiian guy.

253
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,633
I'm starving, let's
order some room service.

254
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,364
They don't have room
service at the Chopper,

255
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:08,998
but we have to go
to the coffee shop.

256
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,702
Hmm.

257
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:16,379
So let's go to the coffee shop.

258
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:44,264
Nobody's watching.

259
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,614
What are you looking at?

260
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,281
You.

261
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:04,451
Well, what do you see?

262
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:08,860
I don't think you're
too sure of yourself.

263
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,233
And you think too much
too, it gets in your way.

264
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,436
That's pretty sharp.

265
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:19,602
I can go on.

266
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,949
I really, really had a
great time last night.

267
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,455
Yeah, you were really fun.

268
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,923
You made me feel
like somebody else.

269
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:39,787
Well maybe you just felt like
yourself for the first time.

270
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:45,598
I really like you Rusty.

271
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:51,765
So what are you doing
for the rest of the day?

272
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,242
Any big plans?

273
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,145
Thought I would just
hang out with you.

274
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,377
Would you put some
lotion on my back,

275
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,580
I can't reach it.

276
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,123
You know you should
moisturize twice a day,

277
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:17,320
it's good for your skin.

278
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,600
You're the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time,

279
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,266
you know that?

280
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:38,279
I need a hundred bucks.

281
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,243
Expensive cigarettes.

282
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:46,215
I need some crystal.

283
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,655
I need it for the pain.

284
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,727
I don't think so.

285
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:56,467
Hey, a lot of fucked up
shit has happened to me,

286
00:23:56,535 --> 00:24:01,666
and I don't mean this as a put
down but you haven't got a clue

287
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,903
of some of the shit
l've been through,

288
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:08,434
you just don't fuckingg know.

289
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:19,012
Let's just think about it later.

290
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:23,960
I was in some videos Rusty.

291
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:32,600
We can rent one of them when we
get my crystal and you can fuck

292
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:40,942
me and watch me being
fucked on TVat the same time.

293
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,981
How's that sound?

294
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,917
Porn star.

295
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,921
Where you going?

296
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,657
I'll be right back.

297
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:00,390
I'll go with you.

298
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:03,628
No, stay here,
I'll be right back.

299
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,641
Hey.

300
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,981
Hey, you going to be around?

301
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,885
What time should I come by?

302
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,321
Okay, I want a
hundred bucks worth.

303
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,326
I know, I know!

304
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:33,195
Listen I'll suck
your cock, relax.

305
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,733
I know I owe you!

306
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,734
No way man!

307
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,794
No, you've got to
give me a break!

308
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,569
Okay, okay, two hundred bucks.

309
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,176
You're still going to
give me a bag right?

310
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,873
Yeah, and the blow job.

311
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:53,941
Listen, take a
fuckingg bath will you?

312
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,737
Wow, look at this.

313
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,798
I was going to come get
you when I was ready.

314
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,207
Wow, this looks great.

315
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,541
What is it a martini
from a can?

316
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,706
And that's not all.

317
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:28,549
After that you're
going to fuck me.

318
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,554
Well that sounds great too.

319
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:34,888
But first, you're going
to go to your wallet

320
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,985
and take out a couple
hundred bucks.

321
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:37,721
And then....

322
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:38,592
And then?

323
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,826
And then we're going
to go get my crystal.

324
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,197
Uh huh.

325
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:47,637
And then we just
fuck and fuck and fuck.

326
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:56,903
Denny, there's no way I'm going to
give you money to buy crystal.

327
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:59,416
There's no way.

328
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:03,420
I think way too much of you now
to just let you kill yourself.

329
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,752
You told me you have AlDS, can't
be good for you to smoke crack

330
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:06,791
when you have AlDS.

331
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,918
Crystal has
nothing to do with AlDS,

332
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,190
okay, there's no connection,
nobody's proved anything.

333
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,630
Denny, you're killing yourself.

334
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,895
So you're not going
to give me the money?

335
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,027
lt's not about money.

336
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,504
So give it to me then.

337
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:25,031
Not for you to buy drugs.

338
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,012
Fuck you man.

339
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,637
Hey.

340
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,312
Hey.

341
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:17,322
So I just came from
the lawyers'office.

342
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:20,091
Oh great.

343
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:24,367
What is going on?

344
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:28,167
Huh, I mean are
we still partners?

345
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,006
Youi hungry?

346
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,569
Meat, uck!

347
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,774
My girlfriend would have a fit.

348
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,249
We're on this yogurt diet thing
and she wants me to clean my

349
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:41,842
intestines with her.

350
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,412
Ahhh, but think what this
meat will do to your intestines?

351
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,017
Yeah, give it to me!

352
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:55,992
So Denny, huh.

353
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,365
What's going on with that?

354
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,233
I think I'm in love with him.

355

wait to get your hands on it.

Just now?

368

He was mad because I wouldn't
give him money for crystal meth.

Jesus.

370
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,006
And do I like him when I don't
give him money for it or when l

371

I mean I'm not his parent right?

373
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:45,378
Should I just use him and fuck
him like everybody else does?

He's not a house Rusty.

You can't restore him.

You two are so sexy!

536
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:14,394
God, it is hot in there!

537
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,434
I'm getting married!

538
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,526
[laughter]

539
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:21,594
Hey, so are we!

540
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:26,473
You have to use my bridesmaids,
if we can find them!

541
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,479
Well, let's go find
your bridesmaids!

542
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,514
We're going to go
find the bridesmaids.

543
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,276
Let's go.

544
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,746
Boy are you hot,

545
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,133
lt is truly hot in there.

546
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,759
Yeah.

547
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:56,431
Yeah I don't really
like clubs anyway.

548
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:00,634
Aren't you Russell Price?

549
00:43:00,811 --> 00:43:05,077
You know I saw a lecture on the
Elwood renovation you did two

550
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,344
years ago at the
Phoenix Art Museum.

551
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,885
I work at a firm in Phoenix.

552
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,614
Yeah, I remember that.

553
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:11,382
Yeah.

554
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:12,922
Did you ask a lot of
questions at that one?

555
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,049
A lot of people asked questions.

556
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:17,116
You remember me?

557
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,395
No, I didn't ask any questions
but I remembered your work,

558
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:22,557
I loved it, I thought the
house looked better after your

559
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:24,624
restoration, honestly.

560
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,068
Everybody says that and I keep
telling people that the building

561
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:29,469
materials now are so much
better than they were then,

562
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,302
you really can't make....

563
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:34,242
lt's a complement, but
you did a fantastic job.

564
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,178
Oh, okay, thank you.

565
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:38,407
I was really impressed.

566
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:39,244
Thank you.

567
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:40,442
You're welcome.

568
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,212
Hey.

569
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,618
Who the hell is this?

570
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:46,815
Hey go get the car, we're
going to go to a party

571
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,448

572
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:49,321
Yeah,just a second.

573
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:50,485
No, now!

574
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,426
Sexy come on, come on,

[music]

578
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:26,892
What's it like being gay?

579
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,955
lt's cool.

580
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:33,470
You know I'm kind of
in love with Daphne.

581
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:37,234
I fantasize about
having sex with her.

582
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,272
Well do it!

583
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,006
I'm getting married silly!

584
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,648
Hello...?

585
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:54,884
Why aren't you
out there with him?

586
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,753
I don't smoke.

587
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,459
You ever been with a woman?

588
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,558
No.

589
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,696
Do you want to?

590
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,136
Uh, nope.

591
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,901
Grosses me out.

592
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,576
Too bad.

593
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:17,842
Cause you're hot.

594
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:21,817

Hot.

Twenty bucks if I can watch.

598
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,721
Twenty-five, thirty!

[door slamming]

600
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:34,665
Why were you looking at me?

601
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:37,828
Why were you looking at me?

602
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:43,198
She asked why I'm with you.

603
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:46,572
Well that's an
interesting question.

604
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:51,176
He said because you were kind.

605
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,876
Rusty is kind.

606
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,943
He really likes me.

607
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:00,420
He wants to take care of me.

608
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:04,188
I never really met
anyone like him before.

609
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,830
What's the matter
baby, you want to go home.

610
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,192
Ah, let's go home.

611
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,464
We're going to go.

612
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:15,869
All right.

613
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,815
I want to be with you.

614
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:37,418
Please keep me with you.

615
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,188
Don't let me go.

616
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,517
Want a hit baby?

617
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,793
Sure you don't want to try?

00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,535
Hey Roger.

643
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:44,711
Hey, it's Denny.

You don't want cash!

650
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:16,301
Well, maybe Antonio
does, maybe I'll call him.

651
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:20,111
Sure.

652
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,075
Yeah, a couple of rocks.

653
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,654
Maybe we'll do the
blowjob thing next time okay.

654
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,917
All right, I'll see you
in a little bit.

657
00:58:23,566 --> 00:58:25,431

Um, who are you?

659
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:48,518
I'm with Rusty.

660
00:58:49,425 --> 00:58:51,859
Where is he?

661
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:57,498
I don't know.

662
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:04,805
Asleep.

663
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,540
Who are you?

664
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:13,446
And what are you doing here?

665
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,516
Rusty loves me.

666
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:18,417
Rusty loves you?

667
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,218
Rusty loves you?

668
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,658

00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:31,197
[door slamming]

670
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:40,939

I love you.

672
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:54,849
Hey.

673
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,017
Sorry I never said
it to you before.

674
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,653
Awe, I don't have to
say it back though do l?

675
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:01,060
As long as you kiss me.

676
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,597
Huh, huh.

677
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:08,695
Love you, kiss you, l
love you too buddy.

678
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,535
Let's go.

679
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:34,356
Can't remember the
last time I did this.

680
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,954
Yeah.

681
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:38,728
lt's nice to get
out of the office.

682
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,868
We're going to be
late for our movie.

683
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,840
There's a meteor shower tonight,

684
01:00:45,908 --> 01:00:49,309
maybe we should just
do that instead.

685
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:53,810
I don't think we can actually see
any stars through the weeds here.

686
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:57,717
We have to drive to the desert
for any kind of visibility.

687
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,160
Hey, where's the crack whore?

688
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:14,829
He's not a thing.

689
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:18,931
Okay, where's Denny?

690
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,977
He is in a drug den
of his own making.

691
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:24,275
Oh.

692
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,050
Hear from the lawyers?

693
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:33,521
Yeah, I got a bill already.

694
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:36,481
You know I thought you were
pushing me out of the way so you

695
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,617
could take credit.

696
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,524
I was.

697
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:39,492
Asshole.

698
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:41,621
You were getting too big.

699
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:44,626
Well that is over with.

700
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,364
Yeah, be careful
what you wish for huh?

701
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:17,591
Denny?

702
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:20,534
Denny!

703
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:44,476
Okay well, l've been a
little distant I know.

704
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:48,757
I'm going to make up for it.

705
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:03,799
So what's up?

706
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:06,706
Just thinking.

707
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,416
About me?

708
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:18,214
Well, yeah, actually.

709
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,588
I mean you're a
really good looking guy.

710
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,489
You know a blond muscular guy
doesn't exactly have a hard time

711
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:30,293
in this town.

712
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:32,797
Who are you?

713
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,303
lt's kind of a big question
for breakfast don't you think?

714
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:40,070
I just-- I want to
know, how did you get here?

715
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,508
I mean you're a beautiful
guy and you pick me up in a

716
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:44,375
convenience store?

717
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:47,280
You don't have anybody?

718
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:50,717
lt's a little hard to believe.

719
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:51,343
What happened?

720
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,581
I don't think so, okay?

721
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:56,648
lf this is going to work out
between us then I have to know.

722
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,956
Honest.

723
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,967
I don't even know where to start.

724
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,567
From the beginning.

725
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:14,166
The beginning.

726
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:20,781
I don't even know where that is.

727
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:32,156
Start somewhere.

728
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:49,236
Well l've always
been an athlete.

729
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:57,177
So I got into football.

730
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:01,987
Well you look like an athlete.

731
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,392
I was good.

732
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:09,090
Fast.

733
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:12,498
Fastest white boy you ever saw.

734
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:26,214
lt got me out of a bad life.

735
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:29,740
You know bad neighborhood.

736
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:33,684
See my neighborhood
you had to fight,

737
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:38,090
you had to be a
tough mother fucker.

738
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:46,624
So I learned early on
that I had to be tough.

739
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:53,070
So I got into
boxing, into football,

740
01:06:54,477 --> 01:07:00,109
and football got me a
scholarship to college.

741
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:05,979
Until then I had never
really been out of the 'hood.

742
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:16,323
Then I met these guys, you know
back in the 'hood I could never

743
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:22,565
tell anyone that I liked guys
or they'd of fuckingg killed me.

744
01:07:25,107 --> 01:07:28,668
I met these guys one
night at a club in LA.

745
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:34,310
They treated me
like a fucking prince.

746
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:39,812
You know what that felt like,
to be treated so fucking special

747
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,414
after the way I grew up.

748
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:45,619
lt felt so fucking good.

749
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:50,995
Those guys wanted me, they
fucking wanted me and I fucking

750
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:54,662
loved it.

751
01:07:54,737 --> 01:08:00,505
So what was a guy like me to do?

752
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:06,276
So I quit school and I moved in with
one of the guys I met that night.

753
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:14,054
Really nice guy,
little older, rich,

754
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:17,559
and he took care of me.

755
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:22,996
Took care of me for awhile.

756
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:26,062
Then he moved on.

757
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:30,663
Yeah, found another
kid to take care of.

758
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,732
And I was over it too at that point.

759
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:35,743
I was...

760
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:42,874
....but I couldn't go
back to school at that point, yeah...

761
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:46,547
...lost my scholarship.

762
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,180
School seemed kind of
stupid anyway if I couldn't play

763
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:51,818
football, I mean what
was the point really?

764
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:59,323
But I had my body.

765
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:03,802
By then I knew how to use it.

766
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:12,903
And that's when l
met the video guy.

767
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:17,209
He's the one that got
you started with crystal.

768
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,583
That's when the jokes
got pretty bad, yeah.

769
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:25,150
You see...

770
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:33,292
...he liked me to do
a lot of guys,

771
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:35,462
you know cause
that was his thing,

772
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:39,167
lots and lots of guys.

773
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:43,672
So he'd get me high.

774
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:48,410
And it just made it
that much easier.

775
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:57,256
Just made it easier.

776
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:16,166
Then one day I woke up kind of
in a haze but I could hear him

777
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:25,244
on the phone selling
me to this pimp...

778
01:10:25,321 --> 01:10:29,348
like a piece of fucking cattle.

779
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:32,789
That was it for me.

780
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:38,390
I packed my bags and I got out.

781
01:10:40,636 --> 01:10:44,265
And I have been on the
streets pretty much ever since.

782
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:52,738
Yeah, every now and
again I meet a guy I like,

783
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:56,342
but you know it's hard to...

784
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:03,019
What do you get out
of hearing this man?

785
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:08,325
I feel like I'm selling
my soul or something.

786
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:20,105
Don't!

787
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:22,006
Just don't!

788
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:24,477
God you are so
fucking full of shit,

789
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:27,982
just like everybody else making me
feel bad telling you all this shit.

790
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:29,039
Denny I love you....

791
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,710
You don't love me!

792
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,811
You don't fucking know man!

793
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:34,879
Look at you!

794
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,187
You've got money,
you've got friends,

795
01:11:37,259 --> 01:11:40,490
you've probably got a boyfriend
to go back to once I'm gone.

796
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:43,224
You're just fucking using me and
you don't even fucking know me.

797
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:43,822
I'm trying to...

798
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:47,767
Fuck you, fuck you!

799
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,864
I'm sorry Rusty.

800
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:25,197
And I'm really sorry Denny.

801
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:29,074
lt's just not working out.

802
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,771
I don't think it's
going to work out.

803
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:38,013
So do you need a ride someplace?

804
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:45,617
No, I'll just get a taxi.

805
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,662
No, I'll give you a ride.

806
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:50,255
[birds singing]

807
01:12:56,805 --> 01:13:00,571
Can you take me
to Echo Park?

808
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,710
[dog barking]

809
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:41,409
So Echo Park,
where now?

810
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:49,089
Where do you want
me to drop you?

811
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:55,557
I guess this is okay then.

812
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:15,140
I don't really want to go.

813
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:19,677
I never felt like this before.

814
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:34,163
I'm so confused right now.

815
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:37,433
Can't we just wait a little?

816
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:45,178
Come on.

817
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:09,363
I don't want you to go.

818
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:12,805

[humming happy birthday]

820
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:54,758
Hey so, uh, you know l'd

823
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:03,041
Thank you.

824
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:06,342
I'm not going to eat it
either, it's too many carbs.

825
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:10,545
That's, you know, that
one is from yours truly

826
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:13,247
and it's not a book.

827
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:15,150
Come on sit down.

828
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:15,814
On that?

829
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:18,860
Yeah, sit, try it out.

830
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,024
Try it!

831
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:20,561
Really?

832
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:21,618
Try it!

833
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:28,102
Oh, hey, wow, that's
fun it's -- yeah- happy?

834
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:30,934
Well this one is from Daniel, so
why don't you open it up and see

835
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,598
what he got you.

836
01:18:32,674 --> 01:18:35,108
Go on kiddo.

837
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,810
Okay, I would just
rip that right off,

838
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:48,151
you know...but.....

839
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,712
What is it?

840
01:19:17,552 --> 01:19:19,452
Wow!

841
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,751
Wow that is really neat.

842
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:26,988
Yeah, he's really--
this is really neat.

843
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:31,896
And look he noticed how
into chairs you are.

844
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:35,962
He's a really great guy Rusty.

845
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:40,804
Definitely seeing him
in a much different way.

846
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:43,169
He really likes me doesn't he?

847
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:45,270
Yeah, yeah, I don't
know what he sees in you,

848
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:48,214
but he sure does!

849
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,377
God, I love it.

850
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:53,818
Let me see it.

851
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:54,617
No.

852
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:55,747
Come on, let me see
it, let me see it.

853
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:56,688
You'll hurt it!

854
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:59,226
I'm not going to
hurt it, give it to me.

855
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:01,961
Careful.

856
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:03,258
What am I going
to do sit on it?

857
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:03,820
Come on.

858
01:20:03,899 --> 01:20:04,797
Careful!

859
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:07,198
Gimme.

860
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:14,301
That's cool.

861
01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:19,712
So I am quitting.

862
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:21,180
You're quitting,
you're quitting what?

863
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:24,377
You're quitting love?

The chair
hunt- for comfort,

865
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:28,621
because I mean....

866
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:31,625
Our Two Architects,
I'm quitting.

867
01:20:31,693 --> 01:20:32,557
What?

868
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:33,753
And you can have
all the restorations,

869
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:34,659
it's yours.

870
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:35,957
Are you out of your mind?

871
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:38,056
What do you think
you're going to do?

872
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:40,328
I made a few phone
calls today.

873
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:43,371
Going to help out with
some design projects,

874
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:45,406
couple free lance jobs.

875
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:46,997
I got a lead on an interior.

876
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:48,042
You're going to go
out on your own?

877
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:51,237
Yeah, I want to be creative.

878
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:53,580
Well that's cool,
I mean, you know.

879
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:56,048
Yeah!

880
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:02,186
Happy birthday.

881
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:05,685
Thanks.

882
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:12,291
Two chairs.

883
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:17,467
Yeah, one for me
and one for you.

884
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:20,439
That's really nice.

885
01:21:21,142 --> 01:21:23,542
lt's not quite homey yet.

886
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:27,446
Well, I don't think you have
homey in your genes Rusty.

887
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:29,312
Come on, I just got
the concept recently.

888
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:32,012
I'm still learning.

889
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:33,748
You and your little buddy?

890
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:36,882
Well, nobody's ever really
called me little before,

891
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:40,485
I mean I lost a little
weight, but I think it's stress.

892
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:44,464
I meant your drug friend.

893
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:47,729
I don't get it.

894
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:51,103
Guess I don't have to.

895
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:52,036
Right?

896
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:53,802
Well he got me confused.

897
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:59,541
I didn't mean him I meant me, how
I don't mean anything to you.

898
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:02,208
Sorry, I didn't want to
bother you with any of this,

899
01:22:02,284 --> 01:22:05,515
I just didn't want to leave
things hanging, so...

900
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:08,249
I deserve better.

901
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,585
Yeah.

902
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:14,527
You do.

903
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:18,265
You deserve better.

904
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:24,532
I'm going to go move in
with some guys from the firm.

905
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:27,541
Huh.

906
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:33,078
I'll call you later.

907
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:37,475
lt shouldn't take me
long to get my stuff.

908
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:03,168
Hello.

909
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:05,405
What the fuck's wrong with you?

910
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,538
I'm fucked up.

911
01:23:06,614 --> 01:23:07,080
Yeah.

912
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:08,274
Go and get him.

913
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,250
I don't want to make him do
something he doesn't want to do.

914
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:14,721
Uh, he's hurt Rusty and
newsflash he's hurt because he

915
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:18,919
likes you, he loves you.

916
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:23,090
For Christ sakes,
don't you love him?

917
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:31,469
Hold that, I'm not giving it.

918
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:37,004
[running]

919
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:49,318
Wait Daniel, don't go,
don't go, please!

920
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:50,790
I want you to stay.

921
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:51,450
I love you.

922
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,821
I love you.

923
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:56,796
Too late Rusty, l
don't think you care,

924
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:57,854
I don't think you can care.

925
01:23:57,932 --> 01:23:58,728
I can!

926
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,267
I do care!

927
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:01,632
Come on, I don't want you to go.

928
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,568
Well I'm not sure
that I want to stay.

929
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:05,469
I want you to stay.

930
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,007
That's not enough.

931
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:10,306
I want you to want
to stay then.

932
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:15,481
Say that again.

933
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:20,112
I want you to want
to stay with me.

934
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:24,885
Come on, come back
inside, come on don't go.

935
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:26,984
Come on.

936
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,552
I don't think I'm right for you.

937
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:31,394
You're wrong, you
are right for me.

938
01:24:31,466 --> 01:24:33,934
You're perfect the way you
are, you don't need fixing up.

939
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:35,492
Yeah, but why now?

940
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,401
Huh?

941
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:39,201
Rusty you've been pushing me
away for so long that I'm not

942
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:41,674
going to go back to
the way things were.

943
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:45,110
Because I'm
learning what love is.

944
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:50,343
I know that I liked houses
because they can't reject me,

945
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:51,715
and I know that
sex isn't love

946
01:24:51,786 --> 01:24:55,153
but it can be a
handy substitute.

947
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:57,714
And I know that love isn't love
unless it's returned to you and

948
01:24:57,792 --> 01:25:00,556
I know that you love me.

949
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:03,722
And I love you.

950
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:08,765
That's why l
don't want you to go.

951
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:12,665
Come on.

952
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:17,575
Come on, come back
inside, come on.

953
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:24,317
Come on, you don't
really want to go do you?

954
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:37,259
ls this too corny
cause I kind of like it?

955
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:41,268
I love it.

956
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:49,074
You want to go back
to my place?

957
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,443
Yeah.

958
01:25:55,283 --> 01:25:58,616
I'm starting to like
the tropical too.

959
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:00,750
Really?

960
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:01,481
No.

961
01:26:01,556 --> 01:26:02,079
[laughter]

962
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,317
Good.

963
01:26:03,391 --> 01:26:06,224
Good?

964
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:12,624
I just made a deal with
Mr. Howell over a martini.

965
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,225
lf I design a pool
house for his daughter,

966
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:18,795

off of Mulholland.

967
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:21,364
A house?

968
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:25,303
For us.

969
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:30,511
So this is like a
lesbian moment right?

970
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:33,986
Definitely,
right, get the U-Haul.

971
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:43,522
So you want to get married?

972
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:49,493
Well, okay.

973
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:53,268
lf that's how you feel.

974
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:03,815
This is how I feel.

975
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:06,913
Where do you want to do it?

976
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:08,546
I don't know.

977
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:10,989
Wherever it's legal this week.

978
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,584
I'll look into it.

979
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:17,153
I'm not sure.

980
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:20,565
Just as long as it's this week.

981
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:23,968
No more premarital sex.

982
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:27,136

know about that one.

983
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,233
Good.
