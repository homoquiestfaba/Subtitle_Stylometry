then prove it.

532
00:40:32,811 --> 00:40:34,552
The real Clutch Powers
would know

533
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:38,618
how to build
his own...bridge.

(CHUCKLING)

535
00:40:49,461 --> 00:40:50,462
Next?

536
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:56,335
Using nothing
but standard
eight-stud bricks,

537
00:40:56,401 --> 00:40:58,847
how many bricks
would it take to build

538
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:03,318
a spiral staircase as
tall as three minifigs?

539
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:08,324
There are more
than 91 5 million ways

540
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,519
to combine
standard LEGO bricks.

541
00:41:11,116 --> 00:41:14,097
But they will never
connect on the diagonal.

542
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,690
So, it's a trick question.

543
00:41:16,755 --> 00:41:17,927
It can't be done.

544
00:41:17,989 --> 00:41:19,366
(LAUGHING)

545
00:41:21,226 --> 00:41:26,767
Not so fast.
For your final test,
you must answer a riddle.

546
00:41:28,033 --> 00:41:30,843
A riddle?
Yes, a riddle.

547
00:41:30,902 --> 00:41:32,973
Trolls ask riddles.

548
00:41:33,038 --> 00:41:34,346
It's what we do.

549
00:41:34,406 --> 00:41:35,976
Fine. Ask away.

550
00:41:36,574 --> 00:41:40,215
You hold my hand,
though we cannot touch.

551
00:41:40,278 --> 00:41:43,350
You hear my voice,
though I do not speak.

552
00:41:43,481 --> 00:41:46,553
You see my face,
though I am not here.

553
00:41:48,086 --> 00:41:49,531
Who am l?

554
00:41:51,823 --> 00:41:57,671
You hold my hand,
you hear my voice,
you see...

555
00:41:59,431 --> 00:42:01,104
You see my face.

556
00:42:03,468 --> 00:42:05,744
The answer is my father.

557
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,246
Oh! You're good.

558
00:42:08,473 --> 00:42:12,046
Now answer me.
Where can l
find Prince Varen?

559
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:15,952
Yes, do tell.
We're dying to know.

560
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:20,225
Hand him over.
Mallock's orders.

561
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:23,161
This is not the man
you are looking for.

562
00:42:25,623 --> 00:42:26,761
Yeah, it is.

563
00:42:26,825 --> 00:42:29,101
Darn! That never
works for me.

564
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:32,198
Well, hate to
eat and run, but...

565
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:41,550
SKELLY: Man, that hurts.
I hate when this happens.

566
00:42:43,241 --> 00:42:45,243
Come on.
Let's get him.
Hey, where'd he go?

567
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,681
There he is, over there.

568
00:42:49,748 --> 00:42:51,625
SKELLY: I can see
where he is, man.

569
00:42:51,683 --> 00:42:52,991
BONES: Okay, wait,
can you remind me?

570
00:42:53,118 --> 00:42:54,426
SKELLY: He went this way.

571
00:42:54,486 --> 00:42:55,965
Which way?
SKELLY: Wait, it might
have been that way.

572
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,727
BONES: Okay.
SKELLY: No, this way.
Let's go.

573
00:42:58,089 --> 00:42:59,762

Okay. All right.

00:42:59,824 --> 00:43:01,326
SKELLY: He's right there.

575
00:43:02,093 --> 00:43:03,970
This way, this way.
l thought there was
a thing over here...

576
00:43:04,028 --> 00:43:05,905
Wait, wait.
Where did he go?

577
00:43:06,197 --> 00:43:08,939
Great. First you lose
the castle, now this.

578
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:11,809
I didn't lose the castle.
You lost the castle.

579
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:13,679
Oh, no, you lost the castle.

580
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:15,615
No, you lost the castle.

581
00:43:15,673 --> 00:43:17,619
You lost the castle.
No backs.

582
00:43:17,675 --> 00:43:19,177
No fair.

583
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:22,690
Besides, we didn't lose it.
We just can't find it.

584
00:43:22,747 --> 00:43:24,556
SKELLY: Yeah, yeah,
and it's not that
we weren't looking,

585
00:43:24,616 --> 00:43:27,563
'cause we were
always looking,
it just wasn't around.

586
00:43:27,619 --> 00:43:30,122
BONES: Exactly.
We just play stupid.

587
00:43:30,188 --> 00:43:31,394
You think we can do that?

588
00:43:31,456 --> 00:43:32,526

Who are you?

I am Hogar The Troll.

598
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:59,518
And you can take me
to Prince Varen?

599
00:43:59,918 --> 00:44:01,591
Open the gates.

00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:06,394

00:44:07,325 --> 00:44:08,599

want these doohickeys?

Those are called

Stack them over there.

In a neat pile.

Technically,
there's no such thing
as a neat pile.

How about these

00:44:41,426 --> 00:44:43,929

I mean, why?

of King Revet

because King Revet
fought for me.

Despite my outward appearance,

634
00:46:43,214 --> 00:46:45,956
he saw that we were
the same on the inside.

635
00:46:46,317 --> 00:46:52,495
He took me in
and embraced me.
He trusted me.

in my power

to keep this kingdom
from falling to
the forces of darkness.

638
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:02,336
But what does Mallock want?

639
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,572
This.

640
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:13,318
This is no ordinary sword.

641
00:47:14,479 --> 00:47:16,652
In the hands of
the rightful king,

642
00:47:16,714 --> 00:47:20,161
it has power over
the mightiest evil.

643
00:47:23,254 --> 00:47:26,258
Alas, we have no king.

644
00:47:26,524 --> 00:47:29,903
If this sword falls
into Mallock's hands,

645
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:33,574
his villainy
will be unstoppable.

646
00:47:33,865 --> 00:47:36,004
But what about Prince Varen?

647
00:47:38,903 --> 00:47:41,440
I do what l can to protect him,

648
00:47:41,673 --> 00:47:44,119
just as his father
once protected me.

649
00:47:44,175 --> 00:47:46,883
But he's young
and inexperienced.

650
00:47:46,944 --> 00:47:51,086
But...
There is no but.
His heart is in it,

651
00:47:51,149 --> 00:47:54,528
but l fear the rest of him
isn't up to the challenge.

652
00:47:54,686 --> 00:47:57,030
I can work with heart.
Where is he?

00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:01,896

meet Prince Varen.

654

I can show you what
you're doing wrong.
It's pretty simple.

658
00:48:14,505 --> 00:48:17,247
I doubt it.
I'm no good
with a sword.

00:48:17,308 --> 00:48:19,811
No, it's a
broadsword,
not an épée.

660
00:48:20,244 --> 00:48:22,781
Hold it high above
your head and swing
from the shoulder.

Who said you could
bring strangers
in here anyway?

of skeletons is amassing
even as we speak.

665
00:48:55,713 --> 00:48:57,522

666
00:48:57,682 --> 00:48:59,093
Not until I'm ready.

00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:03,030
I'm here to help you
defeat the evil wizard.
Trust me. I can help.

668
00:49:03,754 --> 00:49:05,165
Like you helped me just now?

669
00:49:05,223 --> 00:49:07,931
I don't need you.
I've got an army.

670
00:49:09,594 --> 00:49:11,267
But do you know how to use it?

671
00:49:11,629 --> 00:49:15,042
A sword is only
as good as the knight
who wields it.

672
00:49:16,067 --> 00:49:17,546
I don't need your help.

673
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:23,583
Oh! What is
wrong with him?

674
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:25,052
Why won't he listen to me?

Remember, he's
not here for you.

676
00:49:28,613 --> 00:49:31,184
You have to be here for him.

00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:33,484

Sweet meteors, it's about time.

Everything is
properly organized
and sorted by function.

First, we arrange
the parts in ascending
order of size. Then...

00:50:07,785 --> 00:50:10,322
Done. What
do you think?

it's not important.

I mean, it is what I said,

699
00:50:44,455 --> 00:50:46,298
but it's not what I meant.
I didn't mean I like you.

trying to say was...

Don't mind me.
It's just my head.

I'll give you a pain
in the head! Coming here

712
00:51:26,497 --> 00:51:30,138
to steal me gold
for that evil wizard.

713
00:51:30,201 --> 00:51:32,340
We thought this
mine was abandoned.

Wait! You
don't understand.

Did you find the Prince?

00:52:04,769 --> 00:52:06,442
Yup.
And?

725
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:08,650
We'll have to defeat
Mallock on our own.

726
00:52:10,942 --> 00:52:11,977
We can do this.
