respond, the Americans

more than he's telling.

350
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:03,779
I know.

351
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:04,867
I helped you write
the speech, remember?

352
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,477
Am I preaching again?

353
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:07,957
Just a little bit, darling.

354
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,698
But that's why I fell in
love with you at Princeton.

355
00:26:09,742 --> 00:26:12,353
You were always so passionate.

356
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:14,094
For an ROTC boy.

357
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:16,923
And you were the most
beautiful student I ever saw.

358
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:18,446
Watch it, ambassador.

359
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:20,361
You told me you fell in
love with me for my mind.

360
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:22,929
After I rewrote your
wretched term paper.

361
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:23,843
Oh, that, too.

362
00:26:23,886 --> 00:26:25,235
Yeah.

363
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,628
You always did come
up with my best lines.

364
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,282
Well, somebody had to.

365
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:31,285
They didn't teach you much
political theory in the army.

366
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:32,852
Now, will you
please come to bed?

367
00:26:42,426 --> 00:26:44,385
Don't worry!

368
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:48,258
Just do as I do!

369
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:49,869
Contact the battle group.

370
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:51,653
Tell them to hold
at a quarter speed.

371
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:53,655
We're not going anywhere
until we hear from Fuller.

372
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:54,525
Aye, sir.

00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:14,720
We've surfaced, captain.

374
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:16,722
The Americans are
ready to make the drop.

375
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:17,548
Good.

376
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,597
PILOT: Target spotted.

377
00:27:25,295 --> 00:27:26,645
And don't forget to jump!

378
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:30,605
Bag!

379
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,282
PILOT: Cargo dropped.

380
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:56,109
Returning to base.

381
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,698
[speaking russian]

382
00:28:27,183 --> 00:28:29,011
How come those sailors
are wearing sidearms?

383
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:43,765
Yes?

384
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:45,636
It's coming through now.

385
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,465
Thank you.

386
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:51,773
What's going on?

387
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:53,383
Newswire service.

388
00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:58,345
An explosion at a meat
packing plant in Dubrovnik.

389
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:00,216
It's all over the networks.

390
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,783
Sounds like a slow news day.

391
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,045
It's still a war zone.

392
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,873
Probably Bosnian rebels.

393
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:07,136
They found the bodies
of 15 Russian sailors

394
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,790
inside that plant.

395
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:11,010
And every one of them had
been assigned to the Odessa.

396
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:12,098
The Odessa?

397
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:13,012
Yeah.

398
00:29:13,055 --> 00:29:13,882
Oh my god.

399
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:20,193
NEWSCASTER: In today's
news, US police

400
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:22,151
found the bodies of
two Naval officers

401
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:24,327
killed somewhere
outside a Naval shipyard

402
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:26,242
in southern coastal waters.

403
00:29:26,286 --> 00:29:28,157
The officers were
shot twice, and then

404
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:29,768
dragged through an
abandoned warehouse

405
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,639
and left inside a meat locker.

406
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:34,773
It took inspectors 6 and
1/2 hours to search the area

407
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:37,210
and recover the bodies
of the officers.

408
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:40,474
Both officers were assigned duty
on the elite Russian submarine,

409
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:44,652
the Odessa, which disappeared
days ago near Syrian waters.

410
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:47,873
The reason for the sub's theft,
as well as the party behind it,

411
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,657
are yet unknown.

412
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,007
The police have not divulged the
exact whereabouts of the site

413
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:54,401
for reasons of
national security.

414
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:56,229
The United States
team and the UN

415
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:58,622
have been working closely
to solve this problem.

416
00:29:58,666 --> 00:30:00,929
They hope to have more answers
within the next few days.

417
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:06,979
I gave him an
agent to counteract

418
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:09,895
the poison in his system.

419
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:12,114
This adrenaline shot will
have him up and moving

420
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:14,377
around in a few hours.

421
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:18,555
But he'll still be very weak.

422
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,382
Can he do his duties?

423
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:26,041
Well, he'll be a bit nauseous
for the next couple of days,

424
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:28,827
as his body expels the poisons.

425
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,352
Right now, all he needs is rest.

426
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:33,483
I'm amazed you
were able to find

427
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:36,095
a counter-agent so quickly.

428
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:39,011
Well, we saw the same
symptoms in the Gulf War.

429
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:45,800
Would you care to see
your humble bridge, Captain?

430
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:52,589
Well, I do need to get in
contact with Sixth Fleet.

431
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:53,982
Ensign?

432
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:56,463
I'll stay here and keep
an eye on our patient.

433
00:30:56,506 --> 00:30:58,726
Could you help me for a moment?

434
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:00,728
Sure.

435
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:02,338
Just let the men know
outside when you are ready.

436
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:13,436
What the hell was
he poisoned with?

437
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,611
Dresden 9.

438
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:16,004
Nerve gas.

439
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:18,137
It was developed by the
Nazis in World War II.

440
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,313
Used b the Iraqis
in the Gulf War.

441
00:31:20,356 --> 00:31:22,576
What's it doing
on a Russian sub?

442
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:24,491
That's a good question.

443
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:25,318
You should ask him.

444
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:29,800
I'm gonna get going.

445
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:42,291
It's from Fuller.

446
00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:43,684
Patient healthy.

447
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:46,165
Russian crew proceeding
with exercise.

448
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:48,558
No damage to the boat.

449
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:51,997
Tell my brother I'm
worried about the food.

450
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,912
His brother?

451
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:54,782
Dismissed.

452
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:01,920
[beeping]

453
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:06,228
The Americans
acknowledged the message.

454
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:08,317
We will continue
along present course.

455
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:09,840
Thank you.

456
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:12,147
So now you see how the
other half lives, eh?

457
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:14,106
Well, I'll tell
you one thing--

458
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:15,542
this is an amazing submarine.

459
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:16,978
It's very clean.

460
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:17,936
But the crew complement--

461
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:18,893
I don't know.

462
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,373
It just seems very small.

463
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:23,506
Most of Odessa's functions
are fully automated.

464
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,986
No need for a large group.

465
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,988
Not even a medical officer?

466
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:29,817
Unfortunately, Lt. Nikita--

467
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,210
he is our medical officer.

468
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:37,999
Well, I guess you guys
are happy to see me, huh?

469
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:39,435
Ah.

470
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:41,698
Would you please join us
for some wine, Captain?

471
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:45,050
Our way of saying thank
you for saving our comrade.

472
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:46,181
Well-- allow me.

473
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:51,360
Ah, eureka.

474
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:55,321
Good year, too, huh?

475
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:58,411
I used to make a good
living being a waiter.

476
00:32:58,454 --> 00:32:59,325
Oh, yes.

477
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:01,327
Look at that.

478
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:05,418
Help me, uh, put
myself through college.

479
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,289
Yes.

480
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,116
OK.

481
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:13,730
To the Russian bear.

482
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:14,731
Hurrah!

483
00:33:14,775 --> 00:33:15,732
Hurrah.

484
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,646
Yes.

485
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,083
Hurrah.

486
00:33:18,126 --> 00:33:20,694
There we are.

487
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:23,218
Little bit.

488
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:24,741
You know, there's a
lot of nice things

489
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:25,960
I'm hearing about the Russians.

490
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,396
Is it all true?

491
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,312
What do you think, huh?

492
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:31,922
[non-english speech]

493
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:01,300
Perhaps not so good
a year as we thought.

494
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:03,389
Very good, Bulganin.

495
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:05,043
Lock him in the crew
quarters with the woman.

496
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,435
And move Nikita into my cabin.

497
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,093
I say we kill him.

498
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,834
And the girl, too.

499
00:34:13,877 --> 00:34:16,358
Lt. Nikita still
needs medical attention.

500
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:19,144
I need them alive
until he recovers.

501
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:21,581
Try and relax, gentlemen.

502
00:34:21,624 --> 00:34:24,105
The Syrians are paying
us a great deal of money

503
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:26,455
for this beautiful submarine.

504
00:34:26,499 --> 00:34:28,892
I want to make sure we're
all alive to enjoy it.

505
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:30,590
What if they don't pay?

506
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:32,374
Our fingers are on
the trigger of the most

507
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:34,768
powerful weapon known to man.

508
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:36,378
They wouldn't dare refuse us.

509
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,206
Our guests have
bought us some, but--

510
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,947
They've bought us 24 hours.

511
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,080
By that time, it
won't matter anymore.

512
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,865
We're very close
to Syrian waters.

513
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:46,127
We'll have the
most powerful navy

514
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:48,477
in the world as our chaperones.

515
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,398
At ease.

516
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:59,532
Having a bit of a
problem with Odessa.

517
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:02,448
Counter-intel is asking if
Odessa's under the control

518
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:03,623
of terrorists.

519
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,059
That's quite a question.

520
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,278
Do they have any evidence?

521
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:07,975
Just some dead
Russian sailors found

522
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:10,064
in a meat packing
plant in Croatia,

523
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,501
and a dispatch from Fuller.

524
00:35:12,545 --> 00:35:14,547
But a message for his brother.

525
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,766
A message?

526
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,593
His brother's dead.

527
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:21,597
It's all in there.

528
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:22,816
You can read it in the chopper.

529
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:25,427
I want you on the
Jefferson ASAP.

530
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:28,300
If this is true, our only
hope may be a Navy doctor

531
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:30,867
who refuses to pick up a gun.

532
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:32,086
God help us all.

533
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:40,442
Permission to
speak freely, sir?

534
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:43,271
- Always.
- I've read Fuller's file.

535
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:45,491
I'm sure he's trying
to get a message to us.

536
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:48,624
If the Odessa has been taken,
God help the hijackers.

537
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:00,375
Captain Fuller?
Captain Fuller?

538
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:01,159
Wake up!

539
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:07,252
Captain Fuller, wake up!

540
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:08,166
Sir?

541
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:09,732
Wake up, sir!

542
00:36:09,776 --> 00:36:10,516
God!

543
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:13,823
Sorry, sir.

544
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:16,913
I couldn't wake you up.

545
00:36:16,957 --> 00:36:17,827
God.

546
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:18,741
What time is it?

547
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:19,655
Noon.

548
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:22,049
Straight up, sir.

549
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:24,051
Orders, sir?

550
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:24,878
Orders?

551
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:29,099
Perhaps, sir,
we should find out

552
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:30,840
who the hell's got
this submarine,

553
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:33,800
find out what they're doing with
it, and try to stop them, sir.

554
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:34,888
No.

555
00:36:34,931 --> 00:36:36,194
Find the ship's stores?

556
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:37,107
No.

557
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:38,108
Steal some weapons?

558
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:43,592
No.

559
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,594
Find me some aspirin.
- Right, sir.

560
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:52,427
Have a drink, Mr. Ambassador.

561
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:55,604
My father once told me never
to drink with politicians.

562
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,650
He said they'll lie about
what they had for breakfast

563
00:36:57,693 --> 00:36:59,391
if it suits them.

564
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:02,959
Well, it seems you, yourself,
are a politician, Mr. Silver.

565
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:05,832
My country is extremely upset
over a situation that seems

566
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:07,399
to be getting out of control.

567
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:09,792
I'd hate to think the
presence of your submarine

568
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:12,099
and our Sixth Fleet
in the Mediterranean

569
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:15,581
would be enough to trigger-- let
us say-- an incident that both

570
00:37:15,624 --> 00:37:17,626
our nations would regret.

571
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,193
Very well, ambassador.

572
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,330
The truth?

573
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:32,293
We have been unable to contact
Odessa since yesterday.

574
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:33,990
The situation is becoming--

575
00:37:39,518 --> 00:37:40,519
dangerous.

576
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:41,694
How dangerous, minister?

577
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,832
There is cargo aboard.

578
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:51,704
What cargo?

579
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:52,574
Hailstorm?

580
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:16,032
Do we have any weapons, sir?

581
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:16,816
Weapons?

582
00:38:23,344 --> 00:38:24,780
Any ideas?

583
00:38:24,824 --> 00:38:26,347
Not unless you have
a bottle of wine handy.

584
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,324
Hold that.

585
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:54,332
[crashing]

586
00:38:58,945 --> 00:38:59,815
[crashing]

587
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:02,383
OK, wait.

588
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:03,297
OK, I know.

589
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,429
I'm tired, too.

590
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:06,561
Let's just do it
one more time, OK?

591
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:08,041
One more.

592
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:08,824
OK.

593
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:13,742
[crashing]

594
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,268
Scream.

595
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:19,182
[screaming]

596
00:39:20,793 --> 00:39:22,011
Scream again.

597
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:24,405
[screaming]

598
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:29,018
[shouting]

599
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:30,890
[screaming]

600
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:51,432
Hold him still!

601
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:52,259
I'm trying!

602
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:06,752
Come on, let's go.

603
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,454
Let's move him.

604
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:14,237
Hurry.

605
00:40:18,024 --> 00:40:19,547
Have we heard from Kradisky?

606
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:21,810
No.

607
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:23,856
Take some men and
check on the prisoners.

608
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:27,947
If Kradisky has been
drinking, kill him.

609
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,078
He needs to take his station.

610
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:29,949
Aye, sir.

611
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:39,393
This way?

612
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,351
OK.

613
00:40:41,395 --> 00:40:42,265
Stay here.

614
00:40:50,752 --> 00:40:52,058
Check the other corridors.

615
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:53,059
All the rooms.

616
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:54,060
See if you can find Kadisk.

617
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:07,726
[non-english speech]

618
00:41:18,867 --> 00:41:19,607
Shit.

619
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:29,051
Go.

620
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:33,012
All right.

621
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:41,716
Slavin to bridge.

622
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,939
Petrov.

623
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:48,288
Kradisky's dead, and the
prisoners have escaped.

624
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:49,115
What?

625
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:52,684
Find the Americans.

626
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:53,728
We need them alive.

627
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:54,512
Aye, captain.

628
00:42:12,617 --> 00:42:14,009
Jeez, you go so fast.

629
00:42:29,024 --> 00:42:30,112
Sorry.

630
00:42:30,156 --> 00:42:31,331
It's OK.

631
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:32,593
It's OK.

632
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:33,855
Where the hell are
we going, anyways?

633
00:42:33,899 --> 00:42:35,378
We're in the access tunnels.

634
00:42:35,422 --> 00:42:36,554
I want to get to
the missile bay.

635
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:38,207
Missile bay?
What the hell for?

636
00:42:38,251 --> 00:42:41,907
Figure that's the last
place they'll look for us.

637
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:42,821
OK.

638
00:42:42,864 --> 00:42:43,648
Go.

639
00:42:58,488 --> 00:43:00,403
Just in time, captain.

640
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:03,624
I'm about to send a little
hunting party after the Odessa.

641
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:07,933
Before you do, Admiral,
please read this.

642
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:11,371
My rank won't impress you, sir,
but the signature at the bottom

643
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:13,982
might.

644
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:16,332
It does.

645
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:17,595
All right, Captain.

646
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:19,031
I'll give your people 12 hours.

647
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:20,075
No more.

648
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:21,250
And then that sub goes down.

649
00:43:29,258 --> 00:43:29,998
Captain?

650
00:43:35,525 --> 00:43:36,788
Are you ready?

651
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,790
I think so.

652
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:39,660
I assume you have a key?

653
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:52,542
How long will it take to
enter the target coordinates?

654
00:43:52,586 --> 00:43:53,761
First I have to
blow up the missile

655
00:43:53,805 --> 00:43:56,242
defense system in each city.

656
00:43:56,285 --> 00:43:57,678
Six cities, six hours.

657
00:43:57,722 --> 00:43:58,723
Maybe more.

658
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:00,594
Excuse me?
Captain?

659
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,336
We are bluffing, aren't we?

660
00:44:03,379 --> 00:44:05,338
Of course, Daninski.

661
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:08,384
Just like the American
game of poker.

662
00:44:08,428 --> 00:44:09,951
We are raising the stakes.

663
00:44:15,914 --> 00:44:17,350
For a conscientious
objector, you

664
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:18,612
sure have a talent for killing.

665
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,313
Wait.

666
00:44:24,357 --> 00:44:25,227
Sorry, sir.

667
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:26,620
I read your file.

668
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,665
How the hell did you
get a hold of that?

669
00:44:30,755 --> 00:44:32,757
The metal's getting hot.

670
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,280
We must be near the missile bay.

671
00:44:34,323 --> 00:44:35,107
Come on.

672
00:44:39,024 --> 00:44:40,939
You are a coward, Daninski?

673
00:44:40,982 --> 00:44:43,768
I have served with you
for a long time, captain.

674
00:44:43,811 --> 00:44:45,683
This mission was
to be about money.

675
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:46,509
Nothing else.

676
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,039
Nothing else.

677
00:44:54,082 --> 00:44:54,866
Take your station.

678
00:45:10,577 --> 00:45:11,578
Check the missile bay.

679
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:12,535
I'm going to weapon storage.

680
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:13,319
Da.

681
00:45:33,208 --> 00:45:34,035
Oh my god.

682
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,080
It is true.

683
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:36,472
Jeez.

684
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:39,040
How the hell would
they fire that?

685
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:40,389
Hydraulics.

686
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:42,304
The platform rises,
inserting the nose

687
00:45:42,348 --> 00:45:44,350
cone into the launch tube.

688
00:45:44,393 --> 00:45:46,047
Codename Hailstorm.

689
00:45:46,091 --> 00:45:48,571
That nose cone contains six
cluster warheads, each of which

690
00:45:48,615 --> 00:45:50,051
can separate targets.

691
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:51,270
Can't it be disabled?

692
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:52,488
We'll find out.

693
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,403
According to
intelligence reports,

694
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:56,362
the Russians made it
operational before completing

695
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:58,016
a series of safety tests.

696
00:45:58,059 --> 00:45:59,539
The warheads are unstable.

697
00:45:59,582 --> 00:46:01,976
If the submarine is
attacked, or if the missile

698
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,674
is detonated prematurely,
this entire ocean

699
00:46:04,718 --> 00:46:07,808
goes up in a mushroom cloud.

700
00:46:07,852 --> 00:46:08,853
It's remoted from the bridge.

701
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:11,203
We can't do anything from here.

702
00:46:11,246 --> 00:46:13,248
Great.

703
00:46:13,292 --> 00:46:14,162
So we take the bridge.

704
00:46:14,206 --> 00:46:14,989
Let's go.

705
00:46:30,004 --> 00:46:31,919
Wait a minute.

706
00:46:31,963 --> 00:46:36,097
You learned all this stuff
in nurse's training, Ensign?

707
00:46:36,141 --> 00:46:37,620
Lieutenant Swain, sir.

708
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:40,319
Navy intelligence.

709
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:44,323
I've been tracking this
little toy for months.

710
00:46:44,366 --> 00:46:48,196
Your job was to get
me on board Odessa.

711
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,810
Well-- So I guess
I did my job, huh?

712
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:04,778
Hey!

713
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,649
[gunfire]

714
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:12,351
Captain's, someone
tapping on the ship.

715
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:13,482
From the inside.

716
00:47:13,526 --> 00:47:14,919
Gunfire?

717
00:47:14,962 --> 00:47:16,834
[gunfire]

718
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:18,879
Come on, get out!

719
00:47:18,923 --> 00:47:20,359
Get out of there!

720
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:21,839
[gunfire]

721
00:47:21,882 --> 00:47:22,840
Move!

722
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:24,363
[gunfire]

723
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:25,146
Shit!

724
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:30,064
[groaning]

725
00:47:33,676 --> 00:47:34,852
Take her to the bridge.

726
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:35,635
I'll get him.

727
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,161
[shouting]

728
00:47:53,696 --> 00:47:55,568
[shouting]

729
00:48:11,062 --> 00:48:12,498
[shouting]

730
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:13,412
[gunshot]

731
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:40,787
It ain't my day.

732
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:43,790
It ain't my day.

733
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,923
WOMAN: Can you be certain?

734
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:47,620
MAN: If Hailstorm
is aboard that sub--

735
00:48:47,663 --> 00:48:49,404
WOMAN: Well, have you
heard from the president?

736
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:52,059
He's in the middle of a
treaty negotiation with China.

737
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:53,278
I can't get through.

738
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:55,193
I'll try him again in an hour.

739
00:48:55,236 --> 00:48:56,324
You know something?

740
00:49:00,676 --> 00:49:04,332
Weapons change, but the
world just can't stop playing

741
00:49:04,376 --> 00:49:08,293
cowboys and Indians, can they?

742
00:49:08,336 --> 00:49:10,599
Diplomacy was a lot simpler in
those days, wasn't it, darling?

743
00:49:10,643 --> 00:49:11,426
So was war.

744
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,269
[music playing]

745
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:51,162
MAN: Status is ready.

746
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:52,076
Status ready.

747
00:49:55,122 --> 00:49:56,471
Captain Donner?

748
00:49:56,515 --> 00:49:59,474
The order's reading
intercept and engage.

749
00:49:59,518 --> 00:50:01,433
That means war.

750
00:50:01,476 --> 00:50:04,436
It means war if we don't.

751
00:50:04,479 --> 00:50:06,220
Submerge the ship.

752
00:50:06,264 --> 00:50:07,134
Submerge the ship!

753
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:08,048
Aye, aye.

754
00:50:08,092 --> 00:50:09,745
20 degrees down bubble.

755
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,633
[groaning]

756
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,213
[gasping]

757
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,066
So nice to see you again.

758
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:11,894
[non-english].

759
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:15,028
You speak our language
beautifully, Ensign.

760
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:19,424
But your choice of words
is not very lady-like.

761
00:51:19,467 --> 00:51:22,514
Now, where is your captain?

762
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:39,531
Ensign Courtney Swain,
United States Navy.

763
00:51:39,574 --> 00:51:40,358
Serial number 5--

764
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:49,193
[gasping]

765
00:52:17,046 --> 00:52:18,787
We've got to give
them a few more hours!

766
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:20,485
It's too late.

767
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:22,313
We've got a submarine moving
to intercept, even as we speak.

768
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:26,360
Slavin?

769
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:28,362
Find Fuller.

770
00:52:28,406 --> 00:52:29,450
Kill him this time.

771
00:52:34,934 --> 00:52:39,591
He doesn't have any place to go.

772
00:52:39,634 --> 00:52:40,505
Wanna bet?

773
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:12,624
American.

774
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:14,234
Oh!

775
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:15,061
Shit!

776
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:27,116
Well, man?

777
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,509
[shouting]

778
00:53:31,643 --> 00:53:33,035
[shouting]

779
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:44,482
[russian] I'm going
to break your back.

780
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:13,424
OK, come on.

781
00:54:27,525 --> 00:54:29,396
[screaming]

782
00:54:32,747 --> 00:54:34,401
There you go.

783
00:54:34,445 --> 00:54:36,708
You'll find this a very
small little ocean when

784
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:38,318
the Navy catches up with you.

785
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:42,366
My dear, if you were sent
after the Hailstorm missile,

786
00:54:42,409 --> 00:54:45,891
then you know the warheads
are quite unstable.

787
00:54:45,934 --> 00:54:48,937
I can't possibly imagine
even the United States Navy

788
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:51,766
would be so callous
as to endanger

789
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:54,682
the entire eastern
Mediterranean.

790
00:54:54,726 --> 00:54:58,207
I really don't expect
a direct attack.

791
00:54:58,251 --> 00:55:01,689
Unfortunately for them,
you and your partner

792
00:55:01,733 --> 00:55:03,909
were their last, best hope.

793
00:55:34,766 --> 00:55:36,115
I doubt anyone
in the Sixth Fleet

794
00:55:36,158 --> 00:55:38,247
knows of Hailstorm's existence.

795
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:40,641
And by now they'll know
Odessa's been hijacked.

796
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:42,382
To them you're just a target.

797
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:44,341
It doesn't matter.

798
00:55:44,384 --> 00:55:47,779
Within a few hours,
Hailstorm's warheads will rain

799
00:55:47,822 --> 00:55:51,043
down on select Russian cities.

800
00:55:51,086 --> 00:55:53,741
Separatists from
Kazakhstan to the Ukraine

801
00:55:53,785 --> 00:55:56,353
will be blamed the Russian
government will be forced

802
00:55:56,396 --> 00:55:58,442
to reclaim those nations.

803
00:55:58,485 --> 00:56:03,534
A new Soviet Union will
rise from the nuclear ash.

804
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:07,059
The relations in the
west will deteriorate.

805
00:56:07,102 --> 00:56:12,281
Call it nostalgia, but
I do miss the Cold War.

806
00:56:12,325 --> 00:56:13,674
And the rest of your crew?

807
00:56:13,718 --> 00:56:17,156
They will die for
me, if necessary.

808
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:18,244
I've kind of
been noticing that.

809
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:05,422
[snap]

810
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:15,910
Slavin to bridge.

811
00:57:15,954 --> 00:57:19,131
He's killed Dmitri.

812
00:57:19,174 --> 00:57:20,785
You can't find one man?

813
00:57:20,828 --> 00:57:23,048
Captain, American
submarine, dead ahead.

814
00:57:23,091 --> 00:57:25,485
Los Angeles class.

815
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,226
Slavin, get up here.

816
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:30,272
It seems the American
Navy wants to play.

817
00:57:30,316 --> 00:57:33,754
Aye, Captain.

818
00:57:33,798 --> 00:57:34,668
Keep looking.

819
00:57:42,328 --> 00:57:43,590
Contact!

820
00:57:43,634 --> 00:57:44,722
Dead ahead, sir.

821
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:45,636
Russian.

822
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:46,680
Akula class.

823
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:47,594
Speed?

824
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:49,117
20 knots.

825
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:51,163
Odessa.

826
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:52,294
OK.

827
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:54,079
Let's give them a wide berth.

828
00:57:54,122 --> 00:57:56,690
Circle below, then around.

829
00:57:56,734 --> 00:57:58,126
We'll take them from behind.

830
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:58,953
Aye, Captain.

831
00:58:45,304 --> 00:58:47,175
[grunting]

832
00:59:00,275 --> 00:59:01,450
Increase speed, Captain?

833
00:59:01,494 --> 00:59:02,669
No.

834
00:59:02,713 --> 00:59:05,716
Captain, the
American is closing in.

835
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:07,413
A very small ocean, captain.

836
00:59:14,681 --> 00:59:15,900
Black rubes one and two.

837
00:59:15,943 --> 00:59:17,554
Black tubes one and two.

838
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:21,558
Assign preset.

839
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:25,823
Firing solution
locked into computer.

840
00:59:25,866 --> 00:59:26,737
Fire one.

841
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,651
Fire one.

842
00:59:27,694 --> 00:59:29,522
One away.

843
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,567
- Fire two.
- Fire two.

844
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:31,350
Two away.

845
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,313
He's fired two torpedoes.

846
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:40,402
Impact in 30 seconds.

847
00:59:40,446 --> 00:59:41,665
Captain?

848
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,057
If we threaten to
launch the missile--

849
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:44,624
Need I remind you,
lieutenant, there

850
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:47,192
is no way to communicate
directly with the Americans.

851
00:59:47,235 --> 00:59:50,630
Captain, that's a Los
Angeles class attack sub.

852
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:52,327
He can outmaneuver you.

853
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:54,242
Surrender before it's too late.

854
00:59:54,286 --> 00:59:55,287
I think not.

855
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,684
20 seconds to impact.

856
01:00:05,253 --> 01:00:06,254
Release countermeasures.

857
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:07,821
Not yet.

858
01:00:07,865 --> 01:00:09,040
What is he doing?

859
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:12,652
Making the bastard
think he got us.

860
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:16,221
Both hit straight and true.

861
01:00:16,264 --> 01:00:17,309
10 seconds to impact, Captain.

862
01:00:20,486 --> 01:00:21,618
Captain?

863
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:22,401
I've done this
before, Daninski.

864
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:26,797
Release countermeasures.

865
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:31,715
Impact in five.

866
01:00:31,758 --> 01:00:33,151
Four.

867
01:00:33,194 --> 01:00:34,369
Three.

868
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:35,719
[non-english speech]

869
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:36,589
Now.

870
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:43,422
[beeping]

871
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,696
We got him, sir.

872
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:57,871
Too soon to tell.

873
01:00:57,915 --> 01:00:59,786
A lot of underwater
debris, sir.

874
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:00,831
There.

875
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:04,573
I'm picking up-- screws, sir.

876
01:01:04,617 --> 01:01:05,705
Very well.

877
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:07,925
Slow to 15 knots.

878
01:01:07,968 --> 01:01:09,709
Flood tubes three and four.

879
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:11,711
Yes, sir.

880
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:13,365
Flood tubes three and four.

881
01:01:13,408 --> 01:01:14,583
Aye aye, sir.

882
01:01:14,627 --> 01:01:16,977
We'll get the
Russkies this time.

883
01:01:17,021 --> 01:01:19,588
Sir, Springfield preparing
for a second attack.

884
01:01:19,632 --> 01:01:21,721
Sir, please call
off the attack.

885
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:23,462
You know the risks when
Hailstorm's warheads

886
01:01:23,505 --> 01:01:25,116
are prematurely detonated.

887
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:26,987
You'll have a massive nuclear
catastrophe on your hands.

888
01:01:27,031 --> 01:01:30,382
I've got Russia's latest
nuclear sub on my hands.

889
01:01:30,425 --> 01:01:33,254
Probably under the
control of terrorists.

890
01:01:33,298 --> 01:01:36,388
The United States Navy is
going to take that sub out,

891
01:01:36,431 --> 01:01:38,390
and those are the
orders of the day.

892
01:01:38,433 --> 01:01:40,958
With all due
respect, Admiral, need

893
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:43,525
I remind you of the
signature on that letter?

894
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:47,660
I'll relay your concerns
to Central Command,

895
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,749
and we'll wait for their reply.

896
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:52,230
And that's all I'm
going to promise you.

897
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:54,362
Thank you, sir.

898
01:01:54,406 --> 01:01:56,495
Signal Springfield and tell
him to break off the attack.

899
01:02:07,506 --> 01:02:08,246
Damn.

900
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:15,427
He's locked onto us.

901
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,297
Why doesn't he fire?

902
01:02:19,344 --> 01:02:20,345
Blow ballast.

903
01:02:20,388 --> 01:02:21,346
Surface.

904
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:22,477
Surface the ship.

905
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:23,304
Aye aye, sir.

906
01:02:29,223 --> 01:02:31,051
The American is surfacing.

907
01:02:31,095 --> 01:02:32,313
A mistake.

908
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:33,662
Flood tubes five and six.

909
01:02:38,363 --> 01:02:39,581
Tubes flooded, Captain.

910
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:41,061
Petrov, he's breaking
off the attack.

911
01:02:41,105 --> 01:02:42,106
Why fire?

912
01:02:42,149 --> 01:02:43,498
Speed of ascent?

913
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:45,544
2 feet per second.

914
01:02:45,587 --> 01:02:47,851
Nikita, prorate
target coordinates.

915
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:51,332
Allow for 23% increase
in ascent speed.

916
01:02:51,376 --> 01:02:53,160
- Locked.
- Fire five and six.

917
01:02:53,204 --> 01:02:53,987
No!

918
01:02:59,471 --> 01:03:01,386
He's fired two fish.

919
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:02,953
Release countermeasures.

920
01:03:10,177 --> 01:03:12,919
10 seconds.

921
01:03:12,963 --> 01:03:14,312
[non-english speech]

922
01:03:18,403 --> 01:03:19,839
They slipped through.

923
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:21,319
[non-english speech]

924
01:03:21,362 --> 01:03:22,146
Jesus, God.

925
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:27,020
[shouting]

926
01:03:31,068 --> 01:03:31,851
Impact!

927
01:03:39,163 --> 01:03:41,382
Large underwater explosion.

928
01:03:41,426 --> 01:03:42,253
Odessa?

929
01:03:42,296 --> 01:03:43,080
Russian screws.

930
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:53,264
We just lost 100
American lives, Captain.

931
01:04:14,589 --> 01:04:15,460
[gunshot]

932
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:17,418
[gunshot]

933
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:21,074
Brzezinski?

934
01:04:21,118 --> 01:04:21,901
Fuller.

935
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:46,491
12 kilometers
to Syrian waters.

936
01:04:46,534 --> 01:04:47,884
Excellent.

937
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:50,190
But there was something
else I needed to do.

938
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,463
Ah, yes.

939
01:05:02,507 --> 01:05:03,290
Swain.

940
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,779
Please, forgive me, my dear.

941
01:05:13,822 --> 01:05:14,606
But--

942
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:22,048
[gunfire]

943
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:36,584
Captain Fuller, I
trust you can hear me?

944
01:05:36,628 --> 01:05:39,152
I just shot your partner.

945
01:05:39,196 --> 01:05:43,026
She's not dead, but she is
bleeding rather profusely.

946
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:46,594
If you would like the
opportunity to save her life,

947
01:05:46,638 --> 01:05:48,727
I suggest you join us
here on the bridge.

948
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:49,510
Black tie.

949
01:06:07,398 --> 01:06:10,183
Thank you very much.

950
01:06:10,227 --> 01:06:11,619
No answer?

951
01:06:11,663 --> 01:06:13,012
The State Department
did, and the president

952
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:13,926
can't be disturbed.

953
01:06:33,511 --> 01:06:34,468
[gunshot]

954
01:06:34,512 --> 01:06:36,340
[screaming]

955
01:06:37,471 --> 01:06:38,342
[gunshot]

956
01:06:39,386 --> 01:06:42,520
Drop the gun, lady!

957
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:43,738
You OK, ambassador?

958
01:06:53,748 --> 01:06:55,098
[shouting]

959
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:14,378
Schikov sent you to
clean up his dirty mess.

960
01:07:14,421 --> 01:07:16,423
That drunken fool?

961
01:07:16,467 --> 01:07:19,078
I take special care of him.

962
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:20,340
He stays quiet.

963
01:07:20,384 --> 01:07:21,907
So will you.

964
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,735
I'm afraid you were getting
too close to the truth.

965
01:07:23,778 --> 01:07:24,605
Odessa?

966
01:07:24,649 --> 01:07:26,129
And her cargo.

967
01:07:26,172 --> 01:07:30,176
Nuclear fire to heat
up a new Cold War.

968
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,874
Say goodbye to your
new world order.

969
01:07:32,918 --> 01:07:33,832
[click]

970
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:34,746
[gunshot]

971
01:07:44,277 --> 01:07:45,191
- Oh, Zachary.
- I'm OK.

972
01:07:45,235 --> 01:07:46,540
- Are you OK?
- I'm OK.

973
01:07:46,584 --> 01:07:47,628
Yes.
- I'll get you some help.

974
01:07:47,672 --> 01:07:48,412
Yeah.

975
01:07:59,205 --> 01:08:01,599
[groan]

976
01:08:01,642 --> 01:08:02,687
She's going into
shock, Captain.

977
01:08:06,517 --> 01:08:07,518
Fuller?

978
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:10,173
Your ensign is failing.

979
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:15,482
And none of us poor sailors
have any medical experience.

980
01:08:15,526 --> 01:08:18,224
Dananski, how far
to Syrian waters?

981
01:08:18,268 --> 01:08:21,923
23 minutes at
the present speed.

982
01:08:21,967 --> 01:08:25,579
Fuller, you're the only
one who can save her.

983
01:08:25,623 --> 01:08:29,888
I can't believe you're just
going to let her die up here.

984
01:08:29,931 --> 01:08:30,976
What is it?

985
01:08:31,019 --> 01:08:31,759
Are you a coward?

986
01:08:46,513 --> 01:08:49,777
Fuller, I am waiting.

987
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:51,649
[groaning]

988
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,929
OK then, give me
the missile key.

989
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:21,287
Don't, Captain.

990
01:09:24,464 --> 01:09:27,250
I did not agree to join you
to fire on our own people.

991
01:09:40,219 --> 01:09:44,571
Daninski, give me the gun.

992
01:09:44,615 --> 01:09:46,225
Is this what you want?

993
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:47,226
Huh?

994
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:49,924
Slavin!

995
01:09:49,968 --> 01:09:51,361
Is this what we came for?

996
01:09:55,321 --> 01:09:57,671
I have family in those cities.

997
01:09:57,715 --> 01:09:59,499
We all do!

998
01:09:59,543 --> 01:10:00,413
[gunshot]

999
01:10:15,472 --> 01:10:16,342

[gunfire]

1001
01:10:29,442 --> 01:10:30,400
Listen, we move.

1002
01:10:30,443 --> 01:10:32,880
Now!

1003
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:34,795
[gunfire]

1004
01:10:43,891 --> 01:10:45,328

1005

[gunfire]

1006
01:10:46,459 --> 01:10:47,243
Ah!

1007
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:52,770
Shit.
You OK?

1008
01:10:52,813 --> 01:10:53,771
Shit.

1009
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:55,773
Swain!

1010
01:10:55,816 --> 01:10:58,341
Swain!

1011
01:10:58,384 --> 01:10:59,167
Shit.

1012
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,611
[alarm]

1013
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,284
Move.

1014
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:31,852
We can fire from
the missile bay.

1015
01:11:31,896 --> 01:11:33,854
I can't do this, Captain.

1016
01:11:33,898 --> 01:11:35,116
Of course you can.

1017
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:00,228
It's from Central Command.

1018
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:05,973
By all means, sir.

1019
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:08,149
We have no choice.

1020
01:12:08,193 --> 01:12:11,152
Thank you for waiting
as long as you did.

1021
01:12:11,196 --> 01:12:14,068
And I'm-- I'm sorry
for the men you lost.

1022
01:12:14,112 --> 01:12:17,333
It doesn't help much.

1023
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:19,117
Send to all ships.

1024
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:23,382
Evacuate to latitude
34, longitude 34.

1025
01:12:23,426 --> 01:12:26,080
Jefferson will commence
air strike in 30 minutes.

1026
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:36,308
OK.

1027
01:12:39,877 --> 01:12:40,921
Move.

1028
01:12:40,965 --> 01:12:41,748
Move!

1029
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,364
How long And no lies.

1030
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:55,066
10 minutes.

1031
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:56,981
I've already sent the launch
data to this computer.

1032
01:12:57,024 --> 01:13:00,201
I just have to reprogram
the launch controls.

1033
01:13:00,245 --> 01:13:01,551
How do we escape?

1034
01:13:01,594 --> 01:13:03,509
Don't worry, Nikita.

1035
01:13:03,553 --> 01:13:05,729
We have a boat standing by.

1036
01:13:05,772 --> 01:13:07,600
The Syrians will
be picking us up.

1037
01:13:28,969 --> 01:13:31,319
[alarm]

1038
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:48,685
Nikita?

1039
01:13:48,728 --> 01:13:51,122
I have to cross-check
the target controls.

1040
01:13:51,165 --> 01:13:52,471
No games.

1041
01:13:52,515 --> 01:13:53,777
But we are firing
blind if I don't.

1042
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,604
Do it quickly!

1043
01:14:08,182 --> 01:14:10,489
[alarm]

1044
01:14:22,936 --> 01:14:24,068
OK.

1045
01:14:24,111 --> 01:14:26,592
That's about all
I can do for now.

1046
01:14:26,636 --> 01:14:27,985
I'll be all right.

1047
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:29,334
We gotta get to Hailstorm.

1048
01:14:29,377 --> 01:14:30,553
They can launch from
the missile bay.

1049
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:31,510
No.

1050
01:14:31,554 --> 01:14:32,859
Wait a minute.

1051
01:14:32,903 --> 01:14:34,382
Being your doctor,
I'm prescribing this.

1052
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:38,169
What is that?

1053
01:14:38,212 --> 01:14:39,083
It's vodka.

1054
01:14:39,126 --> 01:14:39,910
Take a swig.

1055
01:14:59,843 --> 01:15:01,148
Done.

1056
01:15:01,192 --> 01:15:02,367
All we need to do
now is set the timer.

1057
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:05,022
Excellent, Nikita.

1058
01:15:05,065 --> 01:15:11,942
You will be remembered as a
hero of the new Soviet Union.

1059
01:15:11,985 --> 01:15:12,856

1061
01:15:44,627 --> 01:15:45,410
OK.

1062
01:15:48,065 --> 01:15:50,589
Now we can go to
the missile bay.

1063
01:15:50,633 --> 01:15:51,721
Come here.

1064
01:15:51,764 --> 01:15:52,548
Hurry.

1066
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:16,006

Help me.

1071
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:37,174
Go to hell!

1072
01:17:45,269 --> 01:17:46,705
Hey!

1073
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:48,185
Hey!

1074
01:17:48,228 --> 01:17:49,186
Help!

1075
01:17:49,229 --> 01:17:50,187
Don't leave!

1076
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:52,276
Don't leave me!

1077
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:53,146
Come back!

1078
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:54,670
Don't leave me!

1079
01:17:54,713 --> 01:17:56,062
[screaming]

1080
01:17:57,716 --> 01:18:00,110
I can stop the missile.

1081
01:18:00,153 --> 01:18:01,111
Help me to the controls.

1082
01:18:01,154 --> 01:18:01,938
Please.

1083
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,480
We'll all be dead if you don't.

1084
01:18:22,523 --> 01:18:24,612
Hell, I'll be dead, anyways.

1085
01:18:24,656 --> 01:18:27,267
So it's your choice.

1086
01:18:27,311 --> 01:18:28,051
Oh, god!

1087
01:18:47,592 --> 01:18:49,115
Hurry up!

1088
01:18:49,159 --> 01:18:49,942
Hurry up!

1089
01:18:56,557 --> 01:18:57,384
Come on!

1090
01:19:06,959 --> 01:19:07,830
You did it!

1091
01:19:17,883 --> 01:19:18,754
You did it.

1092
01:19:37,816 --> 01:19:40,166
Whoa!
Jeez.

1093
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,342
I thought I told you
to go to the bridge.

1094
01:19:42,386 --> 01:19:44,823
I took a detour and
shut down Hailstorm.

1095
01:19:44,867 --> 01:19:45,824
Right.

1096
01:19:45,868 --> 01:19:47,217
Let's get the hell out of here.

1097
01:20:07,237 --> 01:20:08,107
You ready to go?

1098
01:20:12,198 --> 01:20:14,679
Let's get out of here.

1099
01:20:14,722 --> 01:20:16,246
Come on.

1100
01:20:16,289 --> 01:20:18,857
All ships, report new
positions within safety zones.

1101
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:20,772
Sub hunters are
moving into position.

1102
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,992
Have them lock on target.

1103
01:20:23,035 --> 01:20:23,906
Aye, sir.

1104
01:20:23,949 --> 01:20:25,211
He's surface.

1105
01:20:25,255 --> 01:20:26,038
Surfaced?

1106
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:43,882
There.

1107
01:20:43,926 --> 01:20:44,665
Come on.

01:21:09,299 --> 01:21:11,083
Picking up a signal
from Odessa, sir.

1109
01:21:11,127 --> 01:21:13,172
Signal's garbled.
In Russian.

1110
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:15,348
Admiral, please!

1111
01:21:15,392 --> 01:21:16,175
I'm sorry.

1112
01:21:34,759 --> 01:21:35,673
Watch out!

01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:10,577
All planes, fire in
60 seconds from my mark.

1115
01:22:10,621 --> 01:22:11,927
Fuller may have control.

1116
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,320
They might be ready
to launch Hailstorm.

1117
01:22:14,364 --> 01:22:16,453
60 seconds from mark.

1118
01:22:31,685 --> 01:22:32,904
SOS!

1119
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,384
- All ships, stand by to fire.
- SOS!

1120
01:22:34,427 --> 01:22:36,038
Launch commencing in--

1121
01:22:36,081 --> 01:22:38,475
Sir, incoming message from
the strike force on Odessa.

1122
01:22:38,518 --> 01:22:40,433
Do not fire!

1123
01:22:40,477 --> 01:22:41,347
FEMALE VOICE: Seven.

1124
01:22:41,391 --> 01:22:43,262
It's Swain and Fuller.

1125
01:22:43,306 --> 01:22:44,350
I repeat--

1126
01:22:44,394 --> 01:22:45,699
They may have control.

1127
01:22:45,743 --> 01:22:47,049
SWAIN: Do not fire.

1128
01:22:47,092 --> 01:22:48,964
Belay the order!

1129
01:22:49,007 --> 01:22:51,227
All aircraft, stand down.

1130
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:52,141
Oh, thank God.

1131
01:22:56,797 --> 01:22:58,625
[shouting]

1132
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:41,059
[shouting]

1133
01:23:50,155 --> 01:23:52,027
[shouting]

1134
01:24:13,135 --> 01:24:16,442
Ambassador, I
would like to express

1135
01:24:16,486 --> 01:24:19,576
my apologies for the
unfortunate turn of events

1136
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:20,925
here at the ministry.

1137
01:24:20,968 --> 01:24:23,058
It could have been
much worse, minister.

1138
01:24:23,101 --> 01:24:26,104
Perhaps we can get together next
week and clean up this mess?

1139
01:24:26,148 --> 01:24:27,758
You may meet
with my successor.

1140
01:24:27,801 --> 01:24:31,414
I'm afraid I won't be available.

1141
01:24:31,457 --> 01:24:32,458
Goodbye, Ambassador Silver.

1142
01:24:37,376 --> 01:24:39,770
What did he say?

1143
01:24:39,813 --> 01:24:42,381
I don't think Schikov will
be around town much longer.

1144
01:24:42,425 --> 01:24:43,513
And neither will we.

1145
01:24:43,556 --> 01:24:45,123
What do you mean?

1146
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:46,951
I've been thinking--

1147
01:24:46,994 --> 01:24:48,996
when was the last time we
were at the White House?

1148
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,217
Well, with you, darling,
at one of those boring state

1149
01:24:52,261 --> 01:24:53,479
dinners we attended.

1150
01:24:53,523 --> 01:24:54,828
Why?

1151
01:24:54,872 --> 01:24:56,134
Well, how would you
like to live there?

1152
01:25:30,212 --> 01:25:31,126
[gunshot]

1153
01:25:45,749 --> 01:25:47,011
OK.

1154
01:25:47,054 --> 01:25:47,838
Jeez.

1155
01:25:53,496 --> 01:25:55,237
It is better.

1156
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:57,630
Mhm.

1157
01:25:57,674 --> 01:26:00,329
Tell me something, Admiral--

1158
01:26:00,372 --> 01:26:02,505
how the hell did you
keep the Odessa afloat?

1159
01:26:02,548 --> 01:26:04,202
You know,
apparently the boat's

1160
01:26:04,246 --> 01:26:06,683
lower compartments automatically
seal when they're flooded.

1161
01:26:06,726 --> 01:26:09,076
You're lucky you got
out when you did.

1162
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,035
It's an amazing submarine.

1163
01:26:11,078 --> 01:26:13,516
We'll return it to the
Russians, of course.

1164
01:26:13,559 --> 01:26:15,518
After we've had a chance
to check it out ourselves.

1165
01:26:15,561 --> 01:26:16,301
Yeah.

1166
01:26:18,825 --> 01:26:20,392
How's Lt. Swain?

1167
01:26:20,436 --> 01:26:23,787
Ask her yourself.

1168
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:26,137
You're a hell of a
sailor, Lieutenant.

1169
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:28,095
Thank you, sir.

1170
01:26:28,139 --> 01:26:29,575
And how.

1171
01:26:29,619 --> 01:26:31,969
Come here, Swain.

1172
01:26:32,012 --> 01:26:32,839
Sit down.

1173
01:26:36,974 --> 01:26:40,195
Captain Fuller, you did
a fine job on that sub.

1174
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:41,979
I need a man like
you in intelligence.

1175
01:26:42,022 --> 01:26:43,023
To hell with that.

1176
01:26:43,067 --> 01:26:43,981
I need a new medical officer.

1177
01:26:49,421 --> 01:26:50,379
Good luck in finding him.

1178
01:26:55,297 --> 01:26:58,561
I need a vacation.

1179
01:26:58,604 --> 01:26:59,388
What about you, Swain?

1180
01:27:11,835 --> 01:27:14,751
