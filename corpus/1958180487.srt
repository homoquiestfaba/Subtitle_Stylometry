1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,250
(flames roar)

2
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:21,800
(gentle whimsical music)

3
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:50,877
- [Penny] All my memories begin here

4
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,600
in the pages of my sister's book.

5
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,510
Looking back, I remember
how Mary filled it

6
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,293
with laughter, smiles, and magic,

7
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,770
but I didn't understand any of that.

8
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,423
I only believed in forgetting,

9
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,583
until Mary taught me how to
turn the pages of my own life.

10
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,578
- [Mary] Oh, look. You're awake.

11
00:03:19,578 --> 00:03:21,660
(Penny groans)

12
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,250
- Damn it.

13
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,350
- Doesn't anyone say good morning anymore?

14
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,983
- Good morning. Damn it.

15
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:31,638
- Good morning back.

16
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,250
(gentle music)

17
00:03:48,033 --> 00:03:51,570
- [Penny] Hey, Mary. Your
book's looking really good.

18
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,820
- [Mary] I worked on it all night.

19
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,053
- How was your date?

20
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,953
- We didn't go.

21
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,723
- [Penny] He didn't take
you to France? Cheapskate.

22
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,300
- I couldn't get my face right.

23
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,773
- [Penny] Oh, thank you.

24
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,360
Oh, that feels so good.

25
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,233
- Penny, what did you do to yourself?

26
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,703
You slept for hours and hours,
and I couldn't wake you up.

27
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,430
- I must be coming down with something.

28
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,160
- You wouldn't talk to me.

29
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,960
It was like you didn't recognize me.

30
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:38,970
- [Penny] Hey, hey, Miss Mary Mack,

31
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,523
don't you worry about a
thing, 'cause I'm fine now.

32
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,454
Can I make it up to you?

33
00:04:45,454 --> 00:04:48,121
- You don't have to do anything.

34
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,393
(gentle whimsical accordion music)

35
00:04:58,518 --> 00:05:02,518
(muffled singing)

36
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:21,459
- You thirsty?

37
00:06:07,472 --> 00:06:09,972
(Mary coughs)

38
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:14,112
- You're getting too big for this.

39
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:14,945
- [Mary] No, I'm not.

40
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:17,400
I'm three years stilted in my growth.

41
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,910
- Stunted. And who told you that?

42
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,863
- Nobody. I read it on a chart.

43
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,370
Guess what just happened?

44
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,137
- What just happened?

45
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,283
- I'm not telling.

46
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:34,112
(Penny and Mary giggling)

47
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,763
Professor's mad at you.

48
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,653
- That's new.

49
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,963
Are you mad at me?

50
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,043
Good.

51
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,948
- Don't go out tonight.
Come to dinner with us.

52
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:55,140
(Penny sighs)

53
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,523
You said you'd do anything.

54
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,220
- How was the clinic?

55
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,380
- Rescheduled.

56
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,450
- [Penny] That's new too.

57
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,353
- So you'll come?

58
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,470
I'll tell you my secret.

59
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,890
- What, and listen to
four hours of the gospel

60
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,120
according to Professor?

61
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,320
- Penny.

62
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,493
- I said I'd go.

63
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,390
Now you owe me a secret.

64
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,397
- Okay, ask me, "What just happened?"

65
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,163
- What just happened?

66
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:34,403
- Not telling.

67
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:41,830
(muffled giggling)

68
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,773
- Okay. Rinse.

69
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,700
- I had a dream about you last night.

70
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,850
- You did? What, that I was in a coma.

71
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,910
- No. I don't wanna tell you.

72
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,650
I'm afraid you'll think it's stupid.

73
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,483
- You won't tell me anything today.

74
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,183
I promise I won't laugh.

75
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,823
- Well, I was looking at this star.

76
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,403
I guess it was a sun.

77
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,740
It was shining down on a
paper forest of paper trees

78
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,093
and paper flowers.

79
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,553
We were laying in a field.

80
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,820
And you said you liked these flowers,

81
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,353
because they wouldn't die,

82
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,163
but I said that's why they're ugly.

83
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:08,887
(whimsical music)

84
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,870
- [Professor] You know, I could
have had children of my own

85
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,330
if I wanted to be treated this way.

86
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,800
- I told you.

87
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,970
- [Professor] Mm.

88
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,090
This is my mother's recipe.

89
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,030
Please don't offend her by not eating any.

90
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,380
- Please tell Professor, that I'm sick.

91
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,260
He doesn't believe me.
Maybe he'll believe you.

92
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,163
- Penny's sick.

93
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,860
- [Professor] Should I lecture
you about your lifestyle?

94
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,133
- [Penny] No. Anyway, I was working.

95
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,220
- [Mary] They always keep her so late.

96
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,413
I wish you'd find a job closer to home.

97
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,730
Professor's mad because
his disability check

98
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,140
was stolen today.

99
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,133
- It's tragic.

100
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,690
- [Professor] Very tragic, but
not as tragic as your life.

101
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,025
- [Penny] Don't start in on me, please.

102
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:29,910
- Eros and Psyche.

103
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,170
- [Mary] Eros and Psyche?

104
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,730
- [Professor] Mm.
- Oh no.

105
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,250
- [Professor] The myth of
Psyche speaks of the journey

106
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,510
of the human soul,

107
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,370
purified by suffering a misfortune

108
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,370
until finally, it achieves
perfect happiness.

109
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,603
- Sounds wonderful.

110
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,880
- Mary, do you think that Psyche

111
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,020
could possibly be a hero of your sister's?

112
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,020
- [Penny] Do you think you
could possibly kiss my ass?

113
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,853
- [Professor] How articulate.

114
00:10:58,853 --> 00:11:00,603
- I know. Let's nobody fight, okay?

115
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,270
- [Professor] It's a shame, you know?

116
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,123
This attitude of yours.

117
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,350
You were such a brilliant girl.

118
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,350
So hot, and determined to
take care of everything.

119
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,573
- I take care of Mary.

120
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,340
- But I felt sure you'd be smart enough

121
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,743
to learn how to take
care of yourself as well.

122
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,633
- [Penny] And that you were
just the man to teach me. Right?

123
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,173
- There's so many other ways
you could be earning a living.

124
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,743
- That's my business.

125
00:11:56,811 --> 00:11:57,810
- [Reporter] Between
representatives of those countries

126
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,460
and Iraqi ministers.

127
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,690
Pat?

128
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,530
- [Reporter] Good evening everyone.

129
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,170
Our top story: the
unthinkable happened today

130
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,003
after the launch

131
00:12:05,003 --> 00:12:08,220
of the highly anticipated
Ulysses one spacecraft,

132
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,140
the first manned flight to explore-

133
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,440
- You think Mary doesn't
know your business?

134
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,523
- I know you do.

135
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,420
- [Reporter] Relies on the sun

136
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,490
for its massive gravitational pull,

137
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,443
precise navigation is critical.

138
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,067
And this is where Ulysses
one's difficulties begin.

139
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:28,920
- I worry about you.

140
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,860
- Just drop it or we're leaving. Okay?

141
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,260
- [Reporter] Were disrupted
by a coronal mass...

142
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,380
And emergency repair was deemed essential.

143
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,673
- What happens to you?

144
00:12:43,852 --> 00:12:44,685
When Mary?

145
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,383
- When Mary what?

146
00:12:49,383 --> 00:12:51,753
- When Mary is gone, dear.

147
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,200
- [Reporter] Have termed, "Horrifying."

148
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,090
- [Penny] Honey, come on, we're gonna go.

149
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,933
- [Professor] Mary.

150
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,557
You will love this.

151
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:19,620
There.

152
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,023
There's plenty of romance.

153
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,163
- Come on.

154
00:13:25,163 --> 00:13:26,180
- Thank you Professor.

155
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,720
- You're welcome.

156
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,870
- [Reporter] If its
trajectory is not corrected,

157
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,070
the capsule could drift
through space for...

158
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:39,870
(eerie ringing)

159
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:53,578
(Mary coughing)

160
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,070
- You need help, sweetheart?

161
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,420
- [Mary] No, I'm all right.

162
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,730
Look what came in the mail
today. You should read this.

163
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,020
- What is it?

164
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,603
- A letter. It's from prison.

165
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,303
Open it and see if it's a killer.

166
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,870
- Figures.

167
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,124
- What?

168
00:14:29,124 --> 00:14:30,720
- [Penny] It's about my book.

169
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,850
- [Mary] Wait, I wanted to read that.

170
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,750
- [Penny] What? So I can hear
about what a nice man he is.

171
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,580
I'm not interested in
some convict's opinion

172
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,103
of my poetry of 10 years ago.

173
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,650
Penny, turn out the light.

174
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,844
(gentle music)

175
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:07,344
- [Penny] Where are you going?

176
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:11,764
What are you doing?

177
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:26,493
- [Man] "Dear Penny, I
know this sounds crazy.

178
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,013
Maybe even a little scary.

179
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,483
A letter out of the
blue from the state pen.

180
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,483
It took a long time,

181
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,813
but I finally got up the
courage to write to you.

182
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,163
I read your book of poetry about the sun,

183
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,280
and it just about kept me alive in here

184
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,507
after what happened."

185
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:57,291
(gentle dramatic music)

186
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,551
(waterfall hisses)

187
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,414
- I'll see you next week now. Okay?

188
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:18,247
- Okay.

189
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,223
- [Penny] Ready?

190
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,410
Why next week?

191
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,270
- Your sister's been a little congested,

192
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,980
in case you hadn't noticed.

193
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,230
I'd like to see her next
week, run some tests.

194
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,780
- What if she's fine next week?

195
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,050
- You know how this disease works.

196
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,670
Do we have to go through this every time?

197
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,110
- Yeah, we do.

198
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,790
This stuff, which is very expensive,

199
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,230
gives her joint pain,

200
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,150
and you run the same tests over and over

201
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,220
and your receptionist
just hassled me again

202
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,510
about her Medicare being screwed up.

203
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,343
- Penny.

204
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,663
- Next week?

205
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,690
- I'm sorry. It's better
when Professor takes you.

206
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,560
- It's more interesting with you.

207
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:04,353
I think the doctor hates you.

208
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,780
- "Your sister's been a little congested,

209
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,307
in case you hadn't noticed."

210
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,780
- Let's go get this stuff filled.

211
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:18,330
(bell rings)

212
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,163
- Hello, ladies.

213
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,060
- Hello.

214
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,543
- Why don't you get us some
bread while we wait, sweetheart?

215
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:29,645
(gentle whimsical music)

216
00:17:36,946 --> 00:17:37,779
- Penny.

217
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:40,290
Penny.

218
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,123
- What?

219
00:17:41,123 --> 00:17:41,956
- Our neighbor.
- Slow down. What neighbor?

220
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:43,110
- The stock boy is our new
neighbor. Come and see.

221
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,943
- No. No.

222
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,003
- Hello.

223
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,000
My name is Mary. Do you remember me?

224
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,800
I poured water on your head.

225
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,793
We're your neighbors.
Me and my sister, Penny.

226
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:18,949
- Mary.
- [Mary] Come on.

227
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,073
We'd like to invite you to dinner.

228
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,100
I don't think he speaks English.

229
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,810
- Well, that's rude.

230
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,760
- I speak a little.

231
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,563
- I'd like to apologize
for my sister, the stalker.

232
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:43,980
- What is a stalker?

233
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,370
- It's when somebody likes
you and you don't like them,

234
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,720
and they follow you around.

235
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,420
So, you'll come to dinner then?

236
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:06,150
Come at eight o'clock.
We're in apartment three.

237
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,050
- [Penny] Come on.

238
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,337
Prescription's filled.

239
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:21,489
- Penny, it's almost eight.

240
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:27,647
Penny.

241
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:41,735
(Mary coughs)

242
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:44,235
(eerie music)

243
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:52,061
Penny.

244
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:57,698
(pager beeps)

245
00:20:07,277 --> 00:20:09,777
(bag rustles)

246
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:18,660
- Do you want some dinner before you go?

247
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,743
- [Penny] Not hungry.

248
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,140
- Smells good.

249
00:20:51,223 --> 00:20:52,723
I hope you have a nice dinner.

250
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,000
Maybe tomorrow, I can take you to a movie.

251
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,610
- Why don't you even wanna meet him?

252
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,270
(door shuts)

253
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,830
(gentle music)

254
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,164
(knocking)

255
00:22:02,164 --> 00:22:02,997
- Shoot.

256
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:12,454
Oh, flowers.

257
00:22:12,454 --> 00:22:13,621
- For you and?

258
00:22:14,486 --> 00:22:17,490
- Penny. Went out.

259
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,323
Come in.

260
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:28,698
(train rumbling)

261
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:35,167
♪ Can't wait a minute 'cause
I ain't got the time today ♪

262
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,180
- Well, I'm on the corner of Bethman,

263
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,573
but nobody's here.

264
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,600
All right, I'll wait.

265
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:52,199

269
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,340
- [Mary] I don't know if
you can tell by meeting her,

270
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,923
but she's a genius.

271
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,253
She wrote a book once.

272
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,913
Do you think I look 16?

273
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:30,560
I almost am, but I'm afraid
I look three years stunted.

274
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,420
- I like the soup. It's good.

275
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,820
- [Mary] Really? I made
it. It's not from a can.

276
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,590
- [Man] My mother is
making a soup like this.

277
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,423
- Really?

278
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,290
Tell me about your family.

279
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,350
Oh, I just said a faux pas, didn't I?

280
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,330
- No. I don't know where is my family.

281
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,273
My country no longer exists.

282
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,723
- Oh.

283
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,803
- Your sister don't like me, I think.

284
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,763
- She doesn't like anyone.

285
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,153
- Why not?

286
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,683
- Because of me.

287
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,323
- [Man] I know this probably
seems crazy, maybe even scary.

288
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,760
But I finally got up the
courage to write to you.

289
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,563
Your poem, To Mary.

290
00:24:41,784 --> 00:24:44,820
(gentle whimsical music)

291
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,200
When I first read it,

292
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,333
I felt like I was breaking on the inside.

293
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,110
It was somebody who
knew what I was feeling.

294
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,320
Somebody who knew what it's
like to lose everything.

295
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,180
When I finished reading your book,

296
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,400
I just had to write you and thank you,

297
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,954
because it's just about
kept me alive in here.

298
00:25:03,954 --> 00:25:06,704
(car horn beeps)

299
00:25:13,633 --> 00:25:15,330
- [Mary] I'm not sad.

300
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,940
I still have this great
belief that exciting things

301
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,710
are going to happen to me.

302
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,243
Scandalous things.

303
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,500
- Is this why you ask me, "Do I look 16?"

304
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,903
- Well, do I? I do, don't I?

305
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,543
Penny remembers things from before.

306
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,453
Things I don't.

307
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,440
When our parents were alive,

308
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,420
we lived in this house with
stilts, right on the beach.

309
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,293
- Stilts?

310
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,383
- Like legs.

311
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,390
Penny's gonna take me
there for my birthday.

312
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,793
- And after the house with the legs?

313
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,663
- After the accident,

314
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,370
we stayed with a foster family,

315
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,283
but we didn't live with them very long.

316
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,850
And we had money from our parents,

317
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,790
and we had money from the book.

318
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,513
And then it all ran out.

319
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,820
- [Man] And now, no more books?

320
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:48,963
- [Mary] It's funny what
you say about your country,

321
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,483
how it doesn't exist.

322
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,090
It's kind of like that with me and Penny.

323
00:27:00,562 --> 00:27:03,145
(somber music)

324
00:27:07,853 --> 00:27:10,635
(train rumbling)

325
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:13,218
(mellow music)

326
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,153
- [Man] What are you doing in there?

327
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,383
Come on.

328
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,130
- [Mary] I never remember anything

329
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,963
besides beginnings and endings.

330
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,430
Why is it that the ending's
the most beautiful part?

331
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,483
- Because it's fake.

332
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,213
Did you like it?

333
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,033
- Yes.

334
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,320
- So, does this make up for dinner?

335
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,943
- Sure.

336
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,363
- So, how was dinner anyway?

337
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,150
- All right.

338
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,680
- Hmm?

339
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,380
- I think you'd like him. He's 22.

340
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,140
- You're obsessed with people's ages.

341
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,960
(Mary coughs)

342
00:28:22,817 --> 00:28:25,317
(bus rumbles)

343
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,840
Mary, why did you put that
convict's letter in my purse?

344
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,400
- He's appealing.

345
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,710
- Appealing what? A life sentence.

346
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,060
- Don't tell me it didn't flatter you

347
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,020
that he liked your book.

348
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,863
- Please.

349
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,040
- His favorite poem was the one to me.

350
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,090
Did you read that part?

351
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,130
- No, I didn't read a word of it.

352
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,590
You like him so much, you write to him.

353
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,990
Or don't. He's probably a rapist.

354
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,463
- Wait. Don't throw it away.

355
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:55,544
- You okay?

356
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,213
Mary?

357
00:29:03,186 --> 00:29:05,686
(Mary coughs)

358
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,890
- We didn't have to go out, you know?

359
00:29:10,995 --> 00:29:11,828
- I'm fine.

360
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:13,950
- Look at you. You have
a fever. Look at you.

361
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,163
- Look at you.

362
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,810
- It's good.

363
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,760
Just a little more.

364
00:29:26,386 --> 00:29:27,842
Good.

365
00:29:27,842 --> 00:29:30,425
(somber music)

366
00:29:39,265 --> 00:29:41,765
(man snoring)

367
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,243
- Smoke?

368
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,030
- It isn't allowed.

369
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,920
- What's he gonna do? He's my uncle.

370
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,633
Besides, he's in a coma out there.

371
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,853
So, how you doing? Is the job okay?

372
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:06,000
- I have an apartment not
far, and I've made a friend.

373
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,833
- Good.

374
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:15,410
- Have you been reading the news?

375
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,940
More the same. All hell's
breaking loose in the south.

376
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,143
Some ceasefire.

377
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,290
There hasn't been anything for you yet.

378
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,540
If I get a letter, I'll
run my ass over here.

379
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,980
- [Mary] Dear Samuel, thank
you for your brilliant letter.

380
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,833
Every poet loves praise, especially me.

381
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,120
And you are so kind to
ask after my sister Mary.

382
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,820
She's such a beautiful girl,

383
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,980
and talented.

384
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,980
And she's very mature for her age.

385
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,933
I hope this can be a start of
a brilliant correspondence.

386
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:03,963
Sincerely.

387
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,413
No.

388
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,263
Your friend and confidante, Penny.

389
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:17,918
(gentle whimsical music)

390
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,237
(muffled music)

391
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,400
- [Penny] Your parents went to Florida,

392
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,593
and all you got was this lousy shirt.

393
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,883
- No, my friend gave it to me.

394
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,940
I came to see Mary.

395
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,222
- Oh, well she's been sick. She's asleep.

396
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:38,359
- [Mary] Penny, I'm getting up.

397
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,783
I'm getting up.

398
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:42,813
- Well in that case, come on in.

399
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,913
- [Mary] This is Penny's
page. That's her hand.

400
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:52,216
(Mary coughs)

401
00:32:54,353 --> 00:32:55,201
- [Man] What is it?

402
00:32:55,201 --> 00:32:58,860
- [Mary] An angel. More stars.

403
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,363
Miss Mary Mac. Stuff.
Buttons, butterflies.

404
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:08,910
Can I hear something in your language?

405
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,910
- What should I say?

406
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,971
- I don't know.

407
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:15,971
How about, "I love you"?

408
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:23,346
- I love you is.

409
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,105
(man speaks foreign language)

410
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:27,272
- That's nice.

411
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:32,633
- I'm gonna get something to drink.

412
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,490
- [Mary] And this is my astronaut page.

413
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,050
Do you know about the astronaut?

414
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,100
He's all alone up in space.

415
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,943
- It's quite nice. Be close to the stars.

416
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:52,620
- No, it's sad.

417
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,910
If he can't fix his ship,

418
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,440
he'll be lost for a billion years,

419
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,453
and the sun will burn him up.

420
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,187
- [Man] Do you only put
sad things in your book?

421
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,323
- No, not just sad.

422
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,283
It's my book of beautiful things.

423
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,820
- Hey, yeah, you're in here.

424
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,810
- [Mary] Penny.

425
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,130
- [Penny] She cut out her old boyfriend

426
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,210
and replaced him with you.

427
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,043
See?

428
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:24,191
- Why did you do that?

429
00:34:26,704 --> 00:34:28,204
- It is beautiful.

430
00:34:43,153 --> 00:34:46,570
(gentle whimsical music)

431
00:34:47,733 --> 00:34:50,460
- [Samuel] It's strange to
think I've never met you,

432
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,000
but there are pieces of you, these poems,

433
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,873
I know by heart.

434
00:34:56,977 --> 00:34:59,640
"Just when life seemed to matter little,

435
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,540
you braved my heart's eclipse

436
00:35:03,028 --> 00:35:04,428
to bathe me with your light.

437
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,880
A thousand different yesterdays

438
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,533
could have left me all alone.

439
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,880
A thousand different yesterdays

440
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,033
would not have left me
bleeding where you touched me.

441
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,153
Lost in the maze of our imagining.

442
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,900
Lost in the harsh glare of forgetting.

443
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,907
The sun, which is always
rising, is always setting."

444
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:37,066
(distant traffic)

445
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,984
- [Professor] Listen to me.

446
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:51,817
- [Penny] No.

447
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:52,650
- [Professor] All it is, listen to me.

448
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,017
All it is is a form that you have to sign.

449
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:55,980
- [Penny] No, no hospital.

450
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,660
- Her lungs are damaged, Penny.

451
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,880
You knew it would come
to this, eventually.

452
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,410
- Yeah, well, I can't deal
with any more hospitals.

453
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,243
- [Professor] You can't deal with them.

454
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,050
You, who won't even
take her to the clinic.

455
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,580
- [Penny] I take her to the clinic.

456
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,230
I just don't see the point anymore.

457
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,760
- [Professor] Well, we're
going to have to learn

458
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,590
to see the point because
this is the reality

459
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,640
that we are faced with.

460
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,710
- Well, why can't they
treat her with antibiotics?

461
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,660
- [Professor] Because the
antibiotics don't work anymore.

462
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,950
- [Mary] Please stop it, you guys.

463
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,150
- [Penny] How do you know
they're not gonna work?

464
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,440
What are you, a doctor all of a sudden?

465
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,273
- [Professor] No, I'm not a doctor,

466
00:36:20,273 --> 00:36:21,570
but I'm the one that spends all my time

467
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,440
speaking to the doctors,

468
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,330
and I think I should have some say

469
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,170
in your sister's treatment,

470
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,060
because I am the one that
has to be responsible

471
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,893
for most of it.

472
00:36:27,893 --> 00:36:28,726
- [Penny] What do you want from me?

473
00:36:28,726 --> 00:36:29,820
You want me to tell you what a worthy,

474
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,440
valuable human being you are?

475
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,150
Fine. I'd be happy to do that.

476
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,400
- This is not about me.
And it's not about you.

477
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,720
- This is about you.

478
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,873
You love to play savior, you
know, but you're not God.

479
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,350
You're just a lonely, irrelevant man

480
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,237
who has no one to take care of.

481
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:46,470
- [Professor] No, no one,

482
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,660
except a very, very sick little girl

483
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,210
with a prostitute dope fiend for a sister,

484
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,230
who doesn't have the guts,

485
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,066
because she's too busy dealing with Johns-

486
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:55,287
- Don't call her that.
- In the street.

487
00:36:55,287 --> 00:36:58,740
You never think about her,
always about yourself.

488
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,120
It's never what Mary needs.

489
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,583
- I need for you guys to stop.

490
00:37:07,576 --> 00:37:10,159
(somber music)

491
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:22,364
- Penny?

492
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:55,593
- I'm not gonna let them
stick knives and tubes in her,

493
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,203
when we all know it won't do any good.

494
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,647
I'll never let them do that to her.

495
00:38:07,764 --> 00:38:11,200
- [Man] She told me she was sick.

496
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,390
- [Penny] Well, did she tell you

497
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,890
they want to cut up her
lung, take part of it out?

498
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,240
What do you want from me?

499
00:38:41,764 --> 00:38:44,847
- We used to call it sister fibrosis.

500
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,330
That's how she used to say
it when she was little.

501
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,653
We thought it was for sisters.

502
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,663
You play that music at night, don't you?

503
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,863
- Yes.

504
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,303
And you, every night?

505
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,093
- Not every night.

506
00:39:26,562 --> 00:39:30,390
- Try to feel?

507
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,043
- Oh no, I don't feel a thing.

508
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:43,661
I don't know why I'm
sitting here talking to you.

509
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,123
- I'm sorry if I'm a stalker.

510
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,453
- Wait.

511
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,273
We'll talk again sometime.

512
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,163
Okay?

513
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:28,429
- [Mary] I don't wanna go to the hospital.

514
00:40:28,429 --> 00:40:29,467
(gentle music)

515
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:30,300
- Okay.

516
00:40:35,097 --> 00:40:36,993
- Tell me again about the beach.

517
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,853
- We lived there all year
round with mom and dad.

518
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:57,030
In the winter, the beach
was completely empty,

519
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,930
and you and I had it all to ourselves.

520
00:41:00,076 --> 00:41:03,723
It felt like infinity.

521
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,700
You'll see when we go there.

522
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,603
- Penny, is it true what Professor said?

523
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,810
- No, sweetheart.

524
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,823
No.

525
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,480
- Well, maybe you could
find a job closer to home.

526
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,893
- Maybe.

527
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,313
- Don't go out tonight. Stay here with me.

528
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,583
Hold still. I'm almost done.

529
00:41:51,148 --> 00:41:54,547
- What do you think? It's beautiful.

530
00:41:54,547 --> 00:41:56,595
- You're an ugly frowning face.

531
00:41:56,595 --> 00:41:57,428
- Shut up.

532
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,813
- Still ugly.

533
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:03,476
Still ugly.

534
00:42:05,464 --> 00:42:06,297
Got you.

535
00:42:07,565 --> 00:42:08,854
Got you.

536
00:42:08,854 --> 00:42:11,521
(Mary coughing)

537
00:42:13,444 --> 00:42:14,361
- You okay?

538
00:42:21,325 --> 00:42:22,290
You okay?

539
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,123
- Yeah.

540
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,673
- I got a letter today
from that guy in prison.

541
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:34,790
- Oh, I wanna read it.

542
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,493
- Tore it up.

543
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:57,451
(ambulance siren)

544
00:42:57,451 --> 00:42:59,451
- Yeah, I got your page.

545
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,373
Okay, I'm on my way.

546
00:43:03,984 --> 00:43:06,901
(eerie jazz music)

547
00:43:19,198 --> 00:43:22,365
(indistinct shouting)

548
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,383
- [Samuel] Dear Penny, thank
you for writing me back.

549
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:49,413
It's funny, I never expected
you to be so cheerful.

550
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,960
You asked me what my interests are.

551
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,783
To tell the truth, I
don't really know anymore.

552
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,980
I was a mechanic before
they put me in here.

553
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,590
But if my appeal comes
through and I get out,

554
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:05,823
I won't go back to that.

555
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:10,857
To answer your second
question, "What's prison like?"

556
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:13,893
It's lonely.

557
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:28,470
- [Mary] "Rules fail. Breaking apart.

558
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:31,143
Falling down and coming undone.

559
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,753
Galaxies collide.

560
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,173
The simplest molecule prevails.

561
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:41,943
You are less than all
these things I cannot see.

562
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,400
You are only that impulse

563
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,137
which instructs my heart to beat."

564
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:52,593
I hope you like that one.

565
00:44:55,564 --> 00:44:59,250
By the way, I was sort of wondering,

566
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,613
if you don't mind telling
me, why are you in prison?

567
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:08,663
(waterfall rushes)

568
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:16,644
(indistinct radio chatter)

569
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:37,886
(stone taps glass)

570
00:45:45,878 --> 00:45:46,961
- [Penny] Hi.

571
00:45:52,772 --> 00:45:56,439
I guess I don't really
have anything to say.

572
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,495
This is stupid.

573
00:45:59,495 --> 00:46:02,495
- Would you like to hear some music?

574
00:46:04,463 --> 00:46:05,463
- All right.

575
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:10,056
(muffled speech)

576
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:15,729
(gentle music)

577
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,350
- Just sit down.

578
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:43,958
- Where are you from?

579
00:46:46,193 --> 00:46:48,693
- [Man] A forest full of snow.

580
00:46:50,824 --> 00:46:53,407
- What's that supposed to mean?

581
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:56,106
- It was a village.

582
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:05,269
- Does the village have a name?

583
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,733
- Not anymore.

584
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,297
It was burned to the
ground. There's nobody left.

585
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:38,553
- You have beautiful eyes, but empty.

586
00:47:44,325 --> 00:47:47,550
- Well then, I guess I'm empty.

587
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:50,673
Can we just shut up and
listen to the music?

588
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,083
I'm sorry.

589
00:48:04,707 --> 00:48:07,546
(gentle music)

590
00:48:07,546 --> 00:48:10,463
(woman vocalizing)

591
00:49:32,628 --> 00:49:35,518
(Mary panting)

592
00:49:35,518 --> 00:49:38,018
(eerie music)

593
00:49:49,893 --> 00:49:51,060
- [Mary] Help.

594
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:57,866
Help me. Help.

595
00:50:44,656 --> 00:50:45,489
- Good morning.

596
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,470
You slept like a rock, little one.

597
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,963
I'm sorry I got in so late.

598
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,673
I was talking to your boyfriend.

599
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,110
- [Mary] Did you kiss him?

600
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,843
- No. Don't be silly.

601
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,840
- He's wonderful though, isn't he?

602
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:14,510
- I like how he is with you.

603
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:18,012
- Oh, Penny.

604
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:21,393
- "Oh Penny," what?

605
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,630
What's wrong with you this morning?

606
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,830
- You kind of feel numb
all over, don't you?

607
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,880
- What are you talking about?

608
00:51:33,176 --> 00:51:34,626
- I did something last night.

609
00:51:36,662 --> 00:51:38,762
I thought it was because I was mad at you.

610
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:41,763
I took one of your pills.

611
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,270
- Are you crazy?

612
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,500
- I never understood it before.

613
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,040
How you didn't feel anything at all?

614
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,720
- Are you crazy?

615
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,910
Then you know what I did?
I threw them all away.

616
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,530
- You had no right to do that.

617
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,390
- [Mary] What do you care
about some stupid pills?

618
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:58,840
I know you can get some more.

619
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:03,330
- Don't turn away from me. Look at me.

620
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:04,260
Why did you do that?

621
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,180
Do you have any idea what
those could do to you?

622
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,713
- [Mary] Leave me alone.

623
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,263
You make me sick.

624
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,373
You like how he is with me?

625
00:52:15,373 --> 00:52:17,553
Like I'm four years old.

626
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,845
That's what you want, isn't it?

627
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:22,053
Look at me.

628
00:52:22,053 --> 00:52:23,641
I'm almost 16 years old,

629
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:27,911
and I'm nothing but a big, overgrown baby.

630
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,959
- No, I don't. I didn't mean-

631
00:52:29,959 --> 00:52:32,393
- Leave me alone you dope fiend. Go away.

632
00:52:39,507 --> 00:52:41,107
- Mary.

633
00:52:41,107 --> 00:52:41,940
- Go away.

634
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:52,346
(papers rustling)

635
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,247
- [Professor] Okay.

636
00:53:05,247 --> 00:53:06,414
- [Penny] Hey.

637
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,047
- [Professor] Ah.

638
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:17,910
You're the last person
I ever expected to see.

639
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:19,560
- [Penny] Okay, here's the thing.

640
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:25,803
If something happens to me, I
want you to take care of Mary.

641
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,040
What do you say to that?

642
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:36,150
- What do you want me to say?

643
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,913
Fine. Splendid. When shall I start?

644
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,793
- No lecture, then?

645
00:53:43,822 --> 00:53:44,655
- You want one?

646
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,370
- Maybe.

647
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:54,220
- That's too bad.

648
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,710
Penny, I'm bored telling you how worthy

649
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,033
and talented you are.

650
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:08,280
Go wreck yourself.

651
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,163
Dinners will be much more
pleasant without you.

652
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:19,323
- [Penny] When you called
that number and I showed up,

653
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:23,193
you didn't expect all
this trouble, did you?

654
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,103
- I thought I was looking
for sex. Something.

655
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,947
But that's not what I found.

656
00:54:41,589 --> 00:54:43,256
- What did you find?

657
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:58,179
- What happened to you, Penny?

658
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:04,050
What turns a brilliant,

659
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:08,993
brilliant girl into
this woman that you are?

660
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:25,200
- You know how you can still see a star,

661
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,583
long after it's dead?

662
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:32,820
The light keeps coming,
and it's just an illusion.

663
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,373
The star doesn't exist.

664
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,673
- You exist.

665
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,660
And I'm going to prove it to you.

666
00:55:51,424 --> 00:55:54,174
(ladder squeaks)

667
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:05,133
Such a beautiful concept.

668
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,243
Simple book of poetry about the sun.

669
00:56:14,555 --> 00:56:15,388
- May I?

670
00:56:20,939 --> 00:56:23,522
(gentle music)

671
00:56:36,547 --> 00:56:37,893
- "Listen, children,

672
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,630
if you learn to touch
in the early morning,

673
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:47,013
you will have brief
touchings and golden sunsets.

674
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:53,030
Otherwise, I can only promise sunsets."

675
00:56:57,408 --> 00:57:00,075
(Mary laughing)

676
00:57:11,218 --> 00:57:13,263
- [Mary] All of it. It's too woo.

677
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,843
- Hey. What are you doing?

678
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:25,680
She's sick, you know? she
shouldn't be running around.

679
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,973
- I'm feeling fine.

680
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,683
- Please sit down with us.

681
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,370
- [Mary] First you till the soil,

682
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,410
and then you plant the seeds.

683
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:41,340
When Penny was my age,

684
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,790
she had ugly hair like
a boy, and no boobs.

685
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:46,710
- So, what's changed?

686
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:47,970
- Oh.

687
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:49,080
- Sorry.

688
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,203
And then you rub it over, but let it rain.

689
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,610
And then what have you
got in the springtime?

690
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:57,543
- A rash.

691
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,703
- A rose garden.

692
00:58:00,663 --> 00:58:01,683
- A rash.

693
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,390
- Rose garden.

694
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:04,469
- Rash.
- Rose.

695
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:05,420
- Rash.
- Rose.

696
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:10,247
- Rash, rash, rash, rash, rash.

697
00:58:10,247 --> 00:58:12,300
- [Mary] Me and Penny
used to make up songs

698
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,573
when we were little.

699
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:17,737
I was Miss Mary Mac and
she was Miss Pennywhistle.

700
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,270
- [Penny] Penny fell into a crack,

701
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:23,850
picked up by Miss Mary Mac.

702
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:26,366
Pocket pocket put it back.

703
00:58:26,366 --> 00:58:29,533
One cent, two cent, three cents smack.

704
00:58:32,733 --> 00:58:34,800
It's good to be a romantic, you know?

705
00:58:35,808 --> 00:58:37,983
She's a sucker for a happy ending.

706
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:47,253
- Do you know that I've
never been on a date before?

707
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,523
- No. There should be many boys.

708
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,530
- Would you go on a date with me?

709
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:57,803
- Mary.

710
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:02,883
- I mean, if I was older.

711
00:59:04,356 --> 00:59:07,317
(Mary coughs)

712
00:59:07,317 --> 00:59:08,163
- You okay?

713
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,147
- [Man] I will go on a
date with you right now.

714
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:15,460
- [Penny] Really?

715
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:17,730
Where will you take her?

716
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:19,787
- To the cinema?

717
00:59:19,787 --> 00:59:20,620
- [Penny] No.

718
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,403
Pretend you've never seen her before.

719
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:29,300
You first see her at a Society Ball.

720
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:31,263
- I'm a society lady.

721
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:33,930
- And she's leaning against.

722
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,090
No, pining-

723
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:36,923
- Pining.

724
00:59:36,923 --> 00:59:40,863
- [Penny] By a clear, silvery fountain.

725
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:43,710
What makes you wanna talk to her?

726
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:48,710
- Oh, I would come to
her because she's lovely.

727
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,780
And how do you say, mysterious?

728
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:56,460
- [Mary] Oh no, you should never say that.

729
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,130
You know why? American
girls don't like that.

730
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,463
It's considered an insult
if you call them mysterious.

731
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:07,323
- [Man] Enough, society lady.
We meet at a simple place.

732
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:09,510
We meet on the bus.

733
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:12,030
- And you're reading a book.

734
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:13,380
- You are reading a book,

735
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:17,586
and I sit beside you so
that you will speak to me,

736
01:00:17,586 --> 01:00:18,813
and I wait and I wait,
and you never speak to me.

737
01:00:22,321 --> 01:00:25,191
Then I say, "What is your name?"

738
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:29,670
- And then I stand and I
say, "This is my stop."

739
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,697
- Then I stand and say,
"This is our stop."

740
01:00:34,456 --> 01:00:35,289
- Oh, he's good.

741
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:38,640
- I must see you again.

742
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,553
My heart will die without you.

743
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:47,663
- When?

744
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,730
- I will tell you a day, Mary.

745
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:55,473
And you will tell me this
is too soon. Or too late.

746
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,073
Tomorrow.

747
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:04,412
- Too late.

748
01:01:04,412 --> 01:01:06,995
(somber music)

749
01:01:12,472 --> 01:01:13,305
- Mary.

750
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:34,973
- [Penny] Mary?

751
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:40,583
Mary.

752
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:48,360
That was nice, what you did.

753
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,923
- Your sister makes me happy.

754
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:51,923
- Yeah.

755
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:53,843
- Wait.

756
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,513
You are working tomorrow night?

757
01:01:59,702 --> 01:02:00,952
- I don't know.

758
01:02:02,153 --> 01:02:05,733
- I leave the store at nine
o'clock. You could meet me.

759
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,493
- Maybe.

760
01:02:15,459 --> 01:02:16,292
Sweetie?

761
01:02:18,073 --> 01:02:20,490
(door slams)

762
01:02:25,896 --> 01:02:28,563
(Mary wheezing)

763
01:02:39,487 --> 01:02:43,904
(somber singing in foreign language)

764
01:03:08,307 --> 01:03:10,474
(gunfire)

765
01:03:23,588 --> 01:03:26,505
(grenade explodes)

766
01:03:40,737 --> 01:03:43,983
- Oh, please, please,
please come and meet me.

767
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,073
- Monster.

768
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:49,810
How are you feeling?

769
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:52,373
- Kind of bad.

770
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,650
- Yesterday was a good day, huh?

771
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,963
You know it was.

772
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,100
- So are you gonna go?

773
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:09,480
- Where?

774
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,313
- Meet him.

775
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:13,263
- Why would I do that?

776
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:17,313
He's your friend, not mine.

777
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:20,103
Anyway, I gotta work.

778
01:04:24,205 --> 01:04:25,038
- Penny.

779
01:04:26,418 --> 01:04:29,001
(gentle music)

780
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:44,277
(Mary coughing)

781
01:05:31,143 --> 01:05:34,920
- [Samuel] Dear Penny,
thank you for your letter

782
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,883
and the poems.

783
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,850
I'm kind of afraid of how you'll take

784
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:40,150
what I've got to tell you.

785
01:05:41,568 --> 01:05:43,140
I want you to know,

786
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:46,533
if I don't hear back from
you, I'll understand.

787
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:51,840
I always meant to tell you about her.

788
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:53,883
About what really happened.

789
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:58,023
All the same, I'm afraid once you know,

790
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:07,070
it may ruin your hopes for
our brilliant correspondence.

791
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,093
- [Professor] You must
rescue my berilianda.

792
01:06:18,093 --> 01:06:20,970
Fell over in the wind and refuses to live.

793
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:21,870
- I'll look at it.

794
01:06:29,790 --> 01:06:34,590
- So, the call of the wild
has once again deprived us

795
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,453
of your sister's company.

796
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,800
What does she eat?

797
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,193
Nuts, berries that she
finds in the street.

798
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:47,040
- I think Penny has a date.

799
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,603
- Penny has a date?

800
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,163
She actually likes somebody?

801
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,120
- [Mary] We both like him very much.

802
01:07:08,042 --> 01:07:10,542
(Penny sighs)

803
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,013
- [Professor] Read that book I gave you?

804
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:17,783
Like it?

805
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:23,947
My cooking really that bad?

806
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:28,783
- No.

807
01:07:32,572 --> 01:07:34,045
- What?

808
01:07:34,045 --> 01:07:34,878
Hm?

809
01:07:36,482 --> 01:07:37,399
What is it?

810
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:41,773
- I guess it's a lot of things.

811
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:46,981
(pager beeping)

812
01:07:49,085 --> 01:07:52,252
(gentle somber music)

813
01:08:21,215 --> 01:08:23,798
- Is this really what you want?

814
01:08:34,347 --> 01:08:36,930
- [Professor] I'm not letting
you go home by yourself.

815
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:39,600
- I'll be fine. I need the air.

816
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,200
I can manage four blocks.

817
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,078
- No, there's no
question. I'm driving you.

818
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:47,207
- I'm not a baby, Professor.
I can do things for myself.

819
01:08:49,694 --> 01:08:52,111
(door slams)

820
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:01,009
(skeleton rattles)

821
01:09:02,936 --> 01:09:05,474
(Mary coughs)

822
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,974
(eerie music)

823
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:17,191
(muffled chatter)

824
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:27,003
- [Penny] Hey baby, I've
been waiting for you.

825
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:31,291
Come on over here.

826
01:09:37,736 --> 01:09:40,153
- [Distorted Voice] Hey baby.

827
01:09:41,019 --> 01:09:43,686
(ominous music)

828
01:09:49,309 --> 01:09:51,976
(Mary coughing)

829
01:10:02,957 --> 01:10:05,540
(pot shatters)

830
01:10:25,998 --> 01:10:26,831
- Oh.

831
01:10:36,241 --> 01:10:37,908
- [Professor] Penny.

832
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,390
- Is this the sister?

833
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:45,420
- Where is she? Can I see her?

834
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:47,280
- [Doctor] Yes. For a short time only.

835
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,050
She has a collapsed lung.

836
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:51,360
Have you not been
monitoring her condition?

837
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,760
- Please can I just see her?

838
01:10:58,184 --> 01:11:01,101
(machines beeping)

839
01:11:03,209 --> 01:11:05,792
(somber music)

840
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:09,060
- [Professor] Penny, if you
elect to destroy your mind

841
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,193
and your body-
- Oh, not now.

842
01:11:10,193 --> 01:11:12,390
- That is your right.
Mary may accept that.

843
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:13,223
She may deny that.

844
01:11:13,223 --> 01:11:15,213
- Where were you when this happened?

845
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:17,740
- Where were you?

846
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:21,053
Do you understand

847
01:11:21,053 --> 01:11:23,190
that what is happening
to your sister is real?

848
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:24,543
This is her life.

849
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:29,550
That when you elect to take
yourself back to the gutter,

850
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:32,490
to drug yourself and abstain from reality,

851
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:34,023
you are abandoning her.

852
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:38,800
And I will not let you make that mistake.

853
01:11:55,259 --> 01:11:57,842
(Mary wheezes)

854
01:12:07,663 --> 01:12:08,580
- I'm here.

855
01:12:18,759 --> 01:12:21,509
(dramatic music)

856
01:12:44,331 --> 01:12:47,331
- [Penny] Good morning, sleepy girl.

857
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,513
- Hey.

858
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:53,835
- Hey.

859
01:12:56,294 --> 01:12:58,044
- Will you bring my book Next time?

860
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:01,163
- Yeah.

861
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,133
Look at you.

862
01:13:09,905 --> 01:13:11,072
- Look at you.

863
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,043
- I was working late.

864
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,073
- Sure.

865
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,830
And I'm the Princess of Persia.

866
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,173
- Comedian.

867
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:38,313
Have you been waiting here for me?

868
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,500
- [Man] Where is Mary?

869
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:44,853
- She's in the hospital.

870
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:49,893
- [Man] I have found my
family. I'm leaving here soon.

871
01:13:53,343 --> 01:13:56,010
(Mary coughing)

872
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:09,497
(Mary wheezing)

873
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:19,613
- Happy birthday, Mary.

874
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:26,483
Open.

875
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:36,730
- What is this?

876
01:14:38,363 --> 01:14:42,603
- For the society lady.
By the silver fountain.

877
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,473
- Thank you.

878
01:14:51,273 --> 01:14:52,653
It's nice and big.

879
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:01,690
You're leaving aren't you?

880
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:05,243
- Yes.

881
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,770
I can't just say goodbye.

882
01:15:10,253 --> 01:15:11,853
- Are you ever coming back?

883
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:16,613
- I don't know.

884
01:15:21,066 --> 01:15:24,817
- Well that's too bad, because
once I get out of here,

885
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:28,233
I was gonna ask you on a date.

886
01:15:32,414 --> 01:15:37,363
- I would've said yes.

887
01:15:37,363 --> 01:15:39,477
- I would've worn the dress.

888
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:42,820
- Of course.

889
01:15:47,503 --> 01:15:49,003
- I would've said,

890
01:15:49,941 --> 01:15:54,441
(Mary and man speak foreign language)

891
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,225
- [Receptionist] Dr. Kravitz,

892
01:16:05,225 --> 01:16:06,960
you have a visitor in the main lobby.

893
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,490
Dr. Kravitz, a visitor in the main lobby.

894
01:16:16,893 --> 01:16:18,693
- What are you guys doing?

895
01:16:19,543 --> 01:16:20,710
- [Penny] Ssh.

896
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,610
- [Mary] Are you almost done?

897
01:16:26,528 --> 01:16:28,950
(gentle whimsical music)

898
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:29,783
- [Penny] Here.

899
01:16:35,664 --> 01:16:38,331
(Mary wheezing)

900
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:53,417
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

901
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:55,990
- Do you like it?

902
01:16:58,611 --> 01:17:00,833
I know it's not as good as the beach.

903
01:17:06,391 --> 01:17:07,391
Make a wish.

904
01:17:10,027 --> 01:17:13,407
(Mary gasping)

905
01:17:13,407 --> 01:17:15,574
- We should call somebody.

906
01:17:16,443 --> 01:17:17,943
- Are you alright?

907
01:17:27,102 --> 01:17:27,935
Mary?

908
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:33,380
Are you alright?

909
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:39,904
- Yeah, I'm okay.

910
01:17:48,082 --> 01:17:50,749
(comet hissing)

911
01:17:52,268 --> 01:17:54,935
(Mary wheezing)

912
01:18:03,149 --> 01:18:06,982
- [Mary] This is what
I'm gonna miss the most.

913
01:18:08,636 --> 01:18:09,469
- What?

914
01:18:14,368 --> 01:18:15,451
- You and me.

915
01:18:19,351 --> 01:18:21,834
(seagulls squawk)

916
01:18:21,834 --> 01:18:25,558
Penny, there's a story I wanna tell you.

917
01:18:25,558 --> 01:18:26,975
It's about a man,

918
01:18:30,443 --> 01:18:33,393
and how he loved this woman very much,

919
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,093
and they were going to get married.

920
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:45,980
Only, it turned out the
woman got very, very sick.

921
01:18:47,250 --> 01:18:52,113
They said without her
treatments, she will quickly die.

922
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:56,770
- Who told you this story?

923
01:18:59,160 --> 01:18:59,993
- Just listen.

924
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,273
So he did the only thing he knew to do,

925
01:19:07,334 --> 01:19:12,334
he took her away from the
hospital and the awful treatments.

926
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:16,513
But he was scared.

927
01:19:16,513 --> 01:19:17,346
- [Samuel] I was afraid.

928
01:19:17,346 --> 01:19:18,570
- They both knew that-

929
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:19,666
- [Samuel] Both knew she
didn't have much time.

930
01:19:19,666 --> 01:19:22,427
- [Mary] She didn't have much time.

931
01:19:22,427 --> 01:19:24,483
- [Samuel] And then, she asked me,

932
01:19:25,950 --> 01:19:27,933
take her to her special place.

933
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:34,153
It was this beautiful waterfall
where we fell in love.

934
01:19:34,153 --> 01:19:38,160
I was far away from the
hospital, but I took her,

935
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,363
'cause she asked me to.

936
01:19:42,845 --> 01:19:44,160
And we got out of the car and stood again

937
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,410
on the edge of the falls.

938
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,563
She just stood there real still,

939
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:53,100
looking out over the edge for a long time.

940
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,900
- [Mary] I started to worry about her.

941
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,370
- [Samuel] I started to worry about her.

942
01:19:56,370 --> 01:19:59,280
- [Mary] She was gonna
do something crazy, like-

943
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,863
- [Samuel] Jump off.
- [Mary] Jump off.

944
01:20:04,230 --> 01:20:06,093
- Did she? Did she jump?

945
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,560
- No.

946
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:15,560
She died his arms, and he
was charged with manslaughter

947
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:21,060
for kidnapping her away
from all the doctors

948
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:24,750
and hospitals and pain.

949
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
But on the edge of that beautiful place,

950
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:41,013
she looked at him and said,

951
01:20:43,147 --> 01:20:44,823
"Don't feel sorry for me.

952
01:20:47,558 --> 01:20:48,508
I am the lucky one.

953
01:20:51,383 --> 01:20:56,177
Other people live in doubt
and pain all their lives.

954
01:20:58,512 --> 01:21:03,512
But I know my love will last forever.

955
01:21:12,313 --> 01:21:13,743
- I like that story.

956
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:18,780
You should try to get
some sleep, little one.

957
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:20,890
See you in the morning.

958
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,100
- [Receptionist] Dr.
Flores, dial 118, please.

959
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:44,043
Dr. Flores, can you please dial 118.

960
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:49,643
- Penny?

961
01:21:53,485 --> 01:21:55,257
- What?

962
01:21:55,257 --> 01:21:56,853
- I'm a friend of Kristjan's.

963
01:21:58,444 --> 01:21:59,277
- Who?

964
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:01,413
- Your neighbor.

965
01:22:03,041 --> 01:22:06,540
- Oh.

966
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:07,373
What is it?

967
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,320
- He asked me to bring you this address

968
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,820
where you can write to him
in Hungary if you want.

969
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:17,823
He leaves today on the bus.

970
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:33,362
(somber whimsical music)

971
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:44,753
- Kristjan?

972
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:50,790
Oh my God. I was afraid
you'd already gone.

973
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:52,590
- This is my bus.

974
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:54,660
- I wanted to say goodbye,

975
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:57,780
and I'm sorry.

976
01:22:57,780 --> 01:22:58,653
I never.

977
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:03,750
I wanted to be your friend.

978
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,160
- [Kristjan] You are my friend.

979
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:08,515
- But I never even knew your name.

980
01:23:08,515 --> 01:23:10,913
- [Tannoy] Last call for eastbound bus 12.

981
01:23:10,913 --> 01:23:12,346
- Oh God, please.

982
01:23:12,346 --> 01:23:17,346
- I know, I know.

983
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:23,073
These things, Penny,
the pain in your heart.

984
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:27,453
What's happening to Mary,
you must forgive yourself.

985
01:23:30,515 --> 01:23:31,693
- I don't think that I can.

986
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:34,408
- You can.

987
01:23:36,508 --> 01:23:37,341
You can.

988
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:41,699
Goodbye, Penny.

989
01:23:43,301 --> 01:23:46,218
(melancholy music)

990
01:24:08,757 --> 01:24:10,860
- [Doctor] I'm sorry to
have to tell you this,

991
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:12,819
but there's nothing more that we can do.

992
01:24:12,819 --> 01:24:13,768
- Can we see her now?

993
01:24:13,768 --> 01:24:15,570
- Yes. Go on in.

994
01:24:15,570 --> 01:24:16,987
- You'll be okay.

995
01:24:23,126 --> 01:24:26,017
(machines beeping)

996
01:24:26,017 --> 01:24:28,434
(Mary gasps)

997
01:24:51,399 --> 01:24:52,899
- Hey, angel girl.

998
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:57,903
- I finished our book.

999
01:25:16,959 --> 01:25:18,376
- It's beautiful.

1000
01:25:28,779 --> 01:25:31,696
- Will you tell me about the beach?

1001
01:25:35,225 --> 01:25:36,058
- Okay.

1002
01:25:36,938 --> 01:25:41,938
We lived there year round,

1003
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:46,356
with our mom and dad.

1004
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:53,493
In the wintertime.

1005
01:25:54,532 --> 01:25:57,115
(gentle music)

1006
01:26:02,336 --> 01:26:04,753
- Promise me you'll still go.

1007
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:20,370
We're getting too big for this.

1008
01:26:26,172 --> 01:26:28,172
- Don't let this happen.

1009
01:26:29,636 --> 01:26:31,469
Don't let this happen.

1010
01:26:39,324 --> 01:26:42,407
- [Mary] What do you think he dreams?

1011
01:26:43,838 --> 01:26:44,671
- Who?

1012
01:26:46,839 --> 01:26:49,422
- Up there, all alone in space?

1013
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:54,460
- [Penny] Baby.

1014
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:00,530
He's probably dreaming about you.

1015
01:27:09,987 --> 01:27:12,570
(Mary wheezes)

1016
01:27:44,605 --> 01:27:48,522
(machines beeping frantically)

1017
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:56,986
(gentle whimsical music)

1018
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:44,710
(prolonged beeping)

1019
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:06,121
(wind whistling)

1020
01:29:28,007 --> 01:29:30,757
(child giggling)

1021
01:29:41,159 --> 01:29:43,470
- [Child] How do you think she died?

1022
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:44,370
- Looks like she drowned.

1023
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:45,420
- We should bury her.

1024
01:29:49,505 --> 01:29:52,172
(child squeals)

1025
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:07,774
- Who are you?

1026
01:30:07,774 --> 01:30:08,607
- Who are you?

1027
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:11,463
- Can we have more?

1028
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:13,703
- More what?

1029
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:15,753
- Stars.

1030
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,370
- [Penny] That's mine.

1031
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:22,357
- I wasn't gonna steal it.

1032
01:30:22,357 --> 01:30:23,607
I was just looking at it.

1033
01:30:29,405 --> 01:30:30,572
- Is that you?

1034
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:36,017
- That's my sister.

1035
01:30:42,973 --> 01:30:45,723
(child laughing)

1036
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:51,490
- Another cartwheel, okay?

1037
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:54,907
(gentle uplifting music)

1038
01:31:35,338 --> 01:31:36,338
- [Man] Hey.

1039
01:31:38,730 --> 01:31:39,980
You're Penny, aren't you?

1040
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:42,143
- Yeah.

1041
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:44,433
- I saved your letters.

1042
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,710
Oh, no, I didn't mean to scare you.

1043
01:31:53,131 --> 01:31:54,579
I shouldn't have come.

1044
01:31:54,579 --> 01:31:55,662
- [Penny] No.

1045
01:31:56,712 --> 01:31:57,545
No.

1046
01:32:02,129 --> 01:32:02,962
Please.

1047
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:05,273
Stay.

1048
01:32:09,912 --> 01:32:12,162
I forgot about the letters.

1049
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:32,823
- They made contact yesterday.

1050
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:35,700
- What?

1051
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:38,253
- The astronaut that you wrote me about.

1052
01:32:39,990 --> 01:32:42,840
He's coming back around the sun.

1053
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:46,650
They can finally talk to him again.

1054
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:47,483
- The astronaut?

1055
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,543
So, how was he then?

1056
01:32:58,590 --> 01:32:59,790
When they talked to him?

1057
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:07,940
- Kind of crazy, they said, but alive.

1058
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:23,103
- [Penny] Now, I know why
Mary made the Book of Stars.

1059
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:26,520
Every time I turn these pages,

1060
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,203
I think about what she taught me.

1061
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:31,863
The best gifts are given in secret,

1062
01:33:32,910 --> 01:33:36,640
and each of us writes our own endings.

1063
01:33:37,563 --> 01:33:40,146
(mellow music)
