(WHISPERING) Bob Barker?

350
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,959
Yeah, my dick
looks like Bob Barker.

351
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,159
No, you asshole, that thing
that stops the wheel.

352
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,119
- What?
- I think I took too much Viagra.

353
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,279
I just really got to take a leak.

354
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,159
You have to just get horizontal.

355
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,999
Get horizontal? What the...

356
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,279
You need to be horizontal.

357
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,279
- Me or the boner?
- Both.

358
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,959
I can't. My boner is
perpendicular to my body.

359
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,079
Just try it, man.

360
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,639
<i>This is the stupidest idea I've
ever heard of. What the...</i>

361
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,919
This isn't... Whoa!
(URINATING)

362
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,479
Wait, bro, it's actually working.

363
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,959
Of course it is,
but, dude, listen to me.

364
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,919
I think the girl that I just
had sex with is a hooker.

365
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,079
What? That's awesome.

366
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,679
No! It's not awesome, man.
What if she makes me pay?

367
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,879
I don't have hooker money.

368
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,439
- You definitely don't have hooker money.
- Dude.

369
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,039
I don't know what to do,
man. You gotta help me.

370
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,759
Okay, well, you know what?
If she asks for cash,

371
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,479
you could pretend that
you're a hooker, too,

372
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,119
and maybe the rates
would balance out.

373
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,159
You are so fucking useless.
Do you know that?

374
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,440
Is your dick touching the water?

375
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,001
Fuck you.

376
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,531
MIKEY: Which one of you
divas uses self-tanner?

377
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,884
I do. Why?

378
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,639
Because I beat off
with it last night.

379
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,759
(BOTH LAUGHING)

380
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,839
Why... Why didn't you
even read the bottle?

381
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,959
I was a little drunk.

382
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,439
- What?
- What?

383
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,165
- My shit is orange.
- JASON: Oh!

384
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,599
Oh, my God.Look at this!

385
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,679
Oh, no.

386
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,399
Who knew that could
even happen to you?

387
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,886
(BOTH CONTINUE LAUGHING)

388
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,239
I didn't know you
could change colors.

389
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,079
- Stop.
- Your dick looks like a yam.

390
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,879
- Your dick looks like a traffic cone.
- Just stop.

391
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,319
Your dick looks like
a can of cheddar Pringles.

392
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,359
That's fucked up.

393
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,079
JASON: You dick looks like
Spike Lee at a Knicks game.

394
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,319
If your dick was jumping over the
river, it would be the General Lee.

395
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,479
(BOTH LAUGHING)

396
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,119
All right! All right! What happened
to you two idiots last night?

397
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,639
I freaked out and left. I
didn't know what to do.

398
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,439
It's her bread and butter. It's
how she keeps the lights on.

399
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,559
You basically robbed a hooker.

400
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,199
I didn't rob her.

401
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,359
Yes, you did. You
robbed this hooker, man.

402
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,639
You're like the opposite
of Robin Hood.

403
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,399
I didn't rob her. And
that's the thing. I mean,

404
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,119
everything else
about her was perfect.

405
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,879
I mean, she was smart.
She was funny.

406
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,999
She was the kind of
girl I would date.

407
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,879
If she didn't, you know, happen
to fuck random guys for money.

408
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,719
- ALL: Yeah.
- That's really the only thing

409
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,239
that's getting in the way
of that relationship.

410
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,439
Fuck you guys.

411
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,399
Did you friend that girl yet, Mikey?
The glasses girl?

412
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,279
No. I mean, can you
even do that that fast?

413
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,079
Dude! You've gotta make her laugh.
Get a rapport going.

414
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,159
- Yeah, man.
- Give me your phone real quick.

415
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,239
Give him your phone. We live in
an extremely efficient world.

416
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,079
Somebody else could be
sealing the deal right now.

417
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,559
Listen, (CHUCKLES) last night was amazing.
Okay? I had a great time.

418
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,159
- You guys were awesome.
- Thank you.

419
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,119
All right? But I'm gonna call Vera.

420
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,079
We've got things
that we need to work on.

421
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,399
- No. That's a bad move.
- Come on.

422
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,599
- You don't wanna do that.
- Horrible move.

423
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,039
- We had so much fun last night.
- Yeah.

424
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,079
Wow.

425
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,399
JASON: What?

426
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,647
Uh, she...

427
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,079
She changed it.

428
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,279
BOTH: What?

429
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,686
What are you talking about?

430
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,799
Uh, Vera.

431
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,241
It used to say, "married,"
and now it says...

432
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,685
It says nothing.

433
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,879
All right, I married a smart girl.

434
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,519
I married the right girl. Right?

435
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,639
I went to med school
right after college.

436
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,888
I did what I was supposed to do.

437
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,924
I checked the boxes.

438
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,519
JASON: But maybe what you
did didn't check hers.

439
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,079
MIKEY: We had the same boxes.

440
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,599
DANIEL:
Did you have the same boxes?

441
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,119
Maybe you need a little
more experience with boxes.

442
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,239
Yeah, maybe we should lead you
down the path to better boxes.

443
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,719
Look, guys. I don't need that.
All right?

444
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,799
I need to call Vera and I
need to work this shit out.

445
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,319
That's what I'm going to do.
I need to call her, okay?

446
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,159
I need to call Vera. I need
to work this shit out.

447
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,479
It kills me to see you like this.

448
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,841
Yeah.

449
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,679
Hey.

450
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,759
It's an opportunity
to have some fun.

451
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,399
Man, this is about all of us, man.

452
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,959
This is about all
of us being together.

453
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,559
When are we all
gonna be unattached?

454
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,479
In our 30s we're gonna
settle down with kids.

455
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,081
We're gonna live a boring life.
It's about us right now.

456
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,159
I don't know.

457
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,079
- We're staying single with you, man.
- I just don't know.

458
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,645
We're staying single with you.

459
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,599
We're gonna keep last night alive
as long as humanly possible.

460
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,245
Nobody gets in a relationship.

461
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,125
Nobody changes their status.

462
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,851
Right?

463
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,522
I'm in.

464
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,719
- Come on!
- Come on!

465
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,285
- Come on!
- Come on!

466
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,565
Michael? Are you in?

467
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,440
Fuck it. I'm in.

468
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,571
(ALL CHEERING)

469
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,729
- So, we going for this?
- Yeah.

470
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,159
I mean, it's a pretty
bleak ending to a book,

471
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,559
so shouldn't we leave people
with some hope?

472
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,839
From where in the Midwest
did this one wash up?

473
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,759
Fresh off her master's
from Chicago.

474
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,919
Master's in what? Sentimentality?

475
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,929
I don't think so.

476
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,759
I just think you have to
believe in possibility.

477
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,639
Oh, sweetie. Welcome to New York.

478
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,605
You're young and you're pretty
and the world is yours.

479
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,168
But you're nobody's first wife yet.

480
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,759
Well, we're all pretty...

481
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,479
- Oh! Oh, look who's here.
- Hi.

482
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,679
FRED: Glad you could make it.

483
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,799
Yeah.

484
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,759
DANIEL: I gotta tell you I'm really
excited about this cover, guys.

485
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,079
JASON: (YAWNS) Hey.

486
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,805
- Here you go.
- Okay.

487
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,399
(SIGHS) Hey.

488
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,284
Holy shit.

489
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,971
Everyone. How's it going?

490
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,566
FRED: Good, good.

491
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,800
Uh...

492
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,719
So, do you want to
tell us a little bit

493
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,127
about your approach
with this cover?

494
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,005
Yeah. I'd love
a little explanation.

495
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,326
Um...

496
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,759
It...
(STAMMERING)

497
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,759
It is what it is.

498
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,199
AMANDA: "It is what it is"?

499
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,319
That's what you say when
you get a parking ticket.

500
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,519
I know.

501
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,405
It looks to me like the
guy here wants to escape.

502
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,489
Hmm. Does he?

503
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,519
AMANDA: And we want him to stay.
That's the fantasy of men in the city.

504
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,959
It seems like she'll bring
him home in the bag,

505
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,919
totally trusting him and then
after they sleep together,

506
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,879
he'll prove to be
too much of an asshole

507
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,606
to actually stick around
for a couple of hours.

508
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,323
So tell me, Jason.
Why wouldn't the guy stay?

509
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,641
Hmm?

510
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,644
I thought you were a hooker.

511
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,079
What?

512
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,159
A hooker.

513
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,239
Why?

514
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,319
There were hooker signs.

515
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,439
What's a hooker sign?

516
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,119
- You had on hooker boots.
- Lots of people have them.

517
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,159
There were tons of condoms.

518
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,279
Did you ever think
they might be there

519
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,439
because I'm not
having a ton of sex?

520
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,039
No! I thought they
were a hooker sign!

521
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,159
What's a hooker sign?

522
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,719
What about <i>The Story of O?</i>

523
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,319
That was research for a book.

524
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,839
There were envelopes full of cash.

525
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,599
I pay my landlord in cash so
that he can commit tax fraud.

526
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,041
How long have you
lived in New York?

527
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,319
Man, not long enough.

528
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,839
Yeah.

529
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,008
Wait. Can I make it up to you?

530
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,930
Let me make it up to you.

531
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,202
You wanna make it up to me?

532
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,527
Can I?

533
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,760
I don't know.

534
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,051
You can have my number.

535
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,725
And...

536
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,562
Maybe you can.

537
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,679
Yeah, dude. Everybody knows you
can't call a girl a hooker.

538
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,279
Even hookers hate
being called hookers.

539
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,759
I'm gonna bring Ellie around.

540
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,919
No, you're not! No, you're not.

541
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,119
I'm gonna get her on the roster.

542
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,279
Wait. A roster?

543
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,359
Yeah. A roster.

544
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,599
It's a group of girls
that you're hooking up with

545
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,919
that keeps you from sending
the wrong message.

546
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,719
- Which is what?
- That you wanna date one of them.

547
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,319
You gotta start building a roster.

548
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,719
Yeah. It'll help ease
the transition a little.

549
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,879
No, no. I do not need
a roster. Okay?

550
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,919
Yes, you do.

551
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,079
I can't keep one girl.

552
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,319
What makes you think I can
handle a bunch of them?

553
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,039
You just keep a bunch of them
for a short period of time

554
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,599
and then you send them out
into the world to flourish.

555
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,879
- Like college kids.
- Yes.

556
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,199
Or like capitalism.

557
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,559
And then you replenish the team.

558
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,119
Think of a roster like a
spiritual and physical...

559
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,279
Mostly physical.

560
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,919
Rejuvenation of the male soul.

561
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,639
Which you guys clearly
don't fucking have.

562
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,879
Think of it like a spa.

563
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,279
A spa for your cock.

564
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,079
- A cock spa.
- Yep.

565
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,679
You just got to use whatever skills

566
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,199
- that you have available to you.
- Mmm.

567
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,999
Girls love personalization.

568
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,079
You guys are idiots.

569
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,281
You're an idiot.

570
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,161
(DOOR OPENS)

571
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,726
Vera!

572
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,759
Look, I'm... I'm sorry
to barge in on you.

573
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,325
What are you doing here?

574
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,000
Okay, look.

575
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,369
I know that this is an
awkward thing to do, but...

576
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,526
Um...

577
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,087
I have been having some pain.

578
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,008
And, um, I just...

579
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,804
I don't know.

580
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,959
You came because
you needed my help.

581
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,639
I came to apologize. I did.

582
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,604
- You came because you needed my help.
- Mikey.

583
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,923
I just... I've been
thinking about you.

584
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,039
It really was just
a simple misunderstanding.

585
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,359
Yeah, it was like, "What
kind of girl would I be"

586
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,199
"if I didn't eventually
find it funny?"

587
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,927
You'd be probably every other
girl in the world. I think.

588
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,046
I'm really sorry.

589
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,719
But I'm not every
other girl in the world.

590
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,001
No.

591
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,239
I guess you're not.

592
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,919
And then I kind of developed
my own style, I guess.

593
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,559
And now you...

594
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,239
Design book covers.

595
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,759
Amongst other things.

596
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,039
Well, I guess you get people
to believe in something enough

597
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,399
to want to buy it.

598
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,719
I get people to
believe in the surface.

599
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,679
To do the one thing your
parents told you not to do.

600
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,719
To judge a book by its cover.

601
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,046
Exactly.

602
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,719
Oh, we weren't supposed to do that.

603
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,079
You weren't supposed to do that.

604
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,159
See? I was encouraged.

605
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,840
Another example of
just plain awful parenting.

606
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,519
But, like, the job
that you have right now,

607
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,761
like, is it something that you
actually want to be doing?

608
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,919
You know what? It can be fun.

609
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,679
But do I love it?

610
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,959
- You don't.
- No.

611
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,844
Don't you want to love something?

612
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,679
What? Do you love what you do?

613
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,839
I started this new lecture series.

614
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,359
And authors can come along and
they can talk about their work.

615
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,559
- That's awesome.
- Yes. So great.

616
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,079
- And people come?
- No.

617
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,805
- No?
- No. (LAUGHS)

618
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,399
But I...

619
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,999
It's okay. I mean, I figure
that if I keep doing It,

620
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,919
it could be a really,
really amazing thing.

621
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,406
(LAUGHING)

622
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,039
You should come along to one
of them if you're around.

623
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,119
Oh, I don't know.

624
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,641
I can't really tell if
it's important to you.

625
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,331
(LAUGHING)

626
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,527
I'm sorry. That's a weird laugh.

627
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,001
ELLIE: This is my favorite
place in the city.

628
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,205
JASON: Yeah. It's beautiful.

629
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,049
(LAUGHS) I know that I'm
romanticizing the idea,

630
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,851
but come on.

631
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,485
That's kind of my dream. To
have the key to Gramercy Park.

632
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,126
New York's charm is you're
surrounded by things you can't have.

633
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,245
New York's charm is it makes
you think you can have them.

634
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,440
You know, I'd love to look
inside before we buy.

635
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,359
Me, too.

636
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,519
In the meantime,
we can go back to my place.

637
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,799
It's very similar, actually.

638
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,049
Except for everything about it.

639
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,439
I gotta get home.

640
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,005
Okay. Yours, it is.

641
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,519
You're one hell of a negotiator.

642
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,199
This kind of stuff just rolls
off your tongue doesn't it?

643
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,607
I'm just trying to make you laugh.

644
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,446
I don't like how well it's working.

645
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,001
(SIGHS) Fuck...

646
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,839
CHELSEA: Wait, so you guys still
haven't gotten Mikey laid?

647
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,879
- No.
- What's wrong with you?

648
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,959
You're like the worst wingman ever.

649
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,879
Are you kidding me, Chelsea?
I'm an incredible wingman.

650
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,079
I know, but, like, nothing?

651
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,239
It's just harder
than you think with him.

652
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,279
Like, what about a blowjob?

653
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,679
I'm good right now, but thank you.

654
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,999
- Uh-huh.
- Maybe in, like, 10 minutes?

655
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,079
Maybe after this beer?

656
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,159
Sorry, I'm just
making a mental list

657
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,119
of all the things I'd like to
do before giving you a blowjob.

658
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,439
Wow. Really?

659
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,959
Oh! Kill myself is number one.

660
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,810
Are you serious?
Jesus. What's number two?

661
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,279
Uh... Just, like,
awaiting trial in Guantanamo.

662
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,919
- Mmm-hmm? Yup.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

663
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,279
Oh, come on, man. The blues?
Are you fucking serious?

664
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,079
What the fuck does Captain
Attractive have to be so sad about?

665
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,599
I don't know.

666
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,279
I think he's going for
brooding and dark, mysterious.

667
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,439
It's kind of working for me.

668
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,719
- That is working?
- Yes.

669
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,239
You cannot be that attractive
and have a skill. That's bullshit.

670
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,159
Well, I'm gonna play,
so you're wrong.

671
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,119
Ooh, then somebody's in trouble.

672
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,368
Cheer up, asshole. You're the guy.

673
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,599
Buckle up.

674
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,519
Hey, excuse me? I just wanted
to tell you great job.

675
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,131
I almost cried right there.

676
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,719
It was really some powerful stuff.

677
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,719
Yeah. It was brooding, dark,
and mysterious, apparently.

678
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,649
- Yeah.
- Thanks. That's what I was going for.

679
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,959
Told you.

680
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,999
This is my friend, Chelsea.

681
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,639
She's not much to look at, but wait
till you hear her play the piano.

682
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,919
Really good.

683
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,246
I can't wait. I'm Diego.

684
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,959
I know you are.

685
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,679
I warn you, though. She can be
really aggressive sometimes.

686
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,799
(LAUGHS) Is that right?

687
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,999
But you can tame her with
tequila and compliments.

688
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,119
- Yeah.
- So...

689
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,679
- Super aggressive.
- Oh, yeah?

690
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,839
Hey, are you home?

691
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,279
<i>MIKEY: No. I'm at the hospital.
Where are you?</i>

692
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,559

It was amazing, man.
She was amazing.

696
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,640

you think is the best

No, I meant the other... Um...

771
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,239
Yeah. I just said
the wrong thing just now.

But at least he offers.

782
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,079
I offer.

783
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,159
You've never offered.

784
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,079

sorry for anything I said.

say in the future.

- You did it for me?

- You had sex with a beautiful woman for me?

Yeah, the "so."

806
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,159

good ever follows the word "so."

807
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,999
"So," where is this going?

00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,559
"So," what're we doing?

809

And you just got the "so"?

810
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,319
Yeah, I just got the "so."

811
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,799
So that's when you get out.

812
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,919
Always?

813
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,167

820
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,359
Yeah. I'm not gonna date her.

what you're getting at, okay?

see what's-her-name?

Yeah. We, like, went to the park.
We hung out.

827
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,319

- No, man.

I think you are. I can
hear it in your voice.

831
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,839
I had sex with Alana.

832
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,439
- You had sex with both of them?
- No.

833
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,959
You fucking double gophered?

834
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,399
- I didn't.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

835
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,359
You double gophered? I love that.

836
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,839
You had sex with both of them.
That's awesome.

837
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,279
No, I didn't. Ellie went home.
Alana came over.

838
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,479
That's what I love about you.

839
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,679
Like, you never push too hard.

840
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,159
- You always have a backup.
- Yeah.

00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,399
Mikey, I love your
thinking on this, man.

867
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,919
The work-date combination.

868
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,079
- It's very impressive.
- Yeah.

869
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,159
I'm just thinking on my toes.

870
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,239
JASON: He knows shit, man.

871
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,159
It's casual. It's innovative.

872
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,879
- Mmm.
- I love your work, man.

873
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,719
I love that jacket.
Where are you going tonight?

874
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,879
I have a pretty big
night ahead of me.

875
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,079
I'm playing the incredibly
wealthy Mr. Von Ferrington.

876
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,639
That's so awesome!

877
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,039
You're role playing.
You're committing.

878
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,119
Exactly. What are you doing?

879
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,199
I'm going to meet up with Chelsea

880
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,279
and see what we can make happen.

881
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,359
Again?

882
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,519
Why is she always hooking
you up with girls?

883
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,959
Have you looked in the mirror?
Have you looked at me?

884
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,719
I'm the most attractive.
So it's the easiest.

885
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,359
- Come on.
- Yeah! That's why.

886
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,679
Guys, in high school, I was voted
most likely to have the best eyes.

887
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,399
- MIKEY: That's just not true.
- So...

888
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,601
Yeah, right.

889
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,606
You idiot.

890
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,559
MRS. ROSE: Do you know that
James Harper lived here?

891
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,721
- JASON: Really?
- He used to be the mayor of New York.

892
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,639
You've really chosen a wonderful
property to look at Mr. Von...

893
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,759
- Ferrington.
- Ferrington.

894
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,439
- Von Ferrington.
- Von Ferrington.

895
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,919
I mean, this is one of the
finest properties in the city.

896
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,088
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

897
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,399
Look at the parquet floors that
are all inlaid and original.

898
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,919
And this.

899
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,168
Let me show you this.

900
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,479
Unfettered access
to the private park

901
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,639
is, of course, one of the finest
things about living on Gramercy.

902
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,999
Unfettered?

903
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,326
Unfettered.

904
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,839
And now further, I'd like you to
take a look at this wrought iron.

905
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,319
Lattice wrought iron
which is the original.

906
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,799
Original?

907
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,559
And we have in here a beautiful,

908
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,279
beautiful, beautiful chandelier,

909
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,839
which is cut crystal.

910
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,839
You'll notice all of the
detail on the ceiling.

911
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,679
Now the Obasan rug is
original of the period.

912
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,690
And we have over there
a stained glass window.

913
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,568
- Let's go.
- Why?

914
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,999
Look at the detail
on this poster here.

915
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,959
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
I'll explain later.

916
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,159
Oh, here, the kitchen.

917
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,885
Quick! The old woman's coming!

918
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,246
Hello?

919
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,999
Won't we get caught?

920
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,559
I don't think so. Let's go.

921
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,999
Hello?

922
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,999
Mr. Ferrington?

923
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,201
Hello?

924
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,439
Whoa, whoa. Slow down. Slow down.
Just walk normal.

925
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,559
What do you mean walk...

926
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,559
- You're walking like a criminal.
- What? This is how I walk.

927
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,719
I'm not a criminal.

928
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,445
But I am.

929
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,559
We have to go. Let's go!

930
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,125
Hello?

931
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,921
Hello?

932
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,719
Okay. You said we need to talk.

933
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,879
Nobody says, "We need to talk,"

934
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,959
unless it's really bad news, right?

935
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,079
No, no, no.

936
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,199
And my grandmother
had ovarian cancer.

937
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,239
No, no, no. You're fine,
you're fine, you're fine!

938
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,399
The tests they ran indicated
nothing out of the ordinary.

939
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,599
- I have all the symptoms.
- Baby, you're fine.

940
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,719
You're fine. You're okay.

941
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,759
- Come here.
- What was that message then?

942
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,519
Come here. No, no. Come here.

943
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,291
Okay. I am sorry.
I just wanted to talk.

944
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,722
Oh, my God. You are such an idiot.

945
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,239
You are such an idiot.

946
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,439
Yes.

947
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,719
Just... Just...
Just come sit down. Okay?

(SIGHS)

949
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,285
Oh, God.

950
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,359
Breathe. Breathe.

951
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,608
Oh, God, I thought I was dying.

952
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,280
(LAUGHS)

953
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,439
Yeah. You thought you were dying.

954
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,971
That was me.

(EXHALES)

956
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,570
Where did we go wrong?

957
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,199
Like, what happened?

958
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,401
What happened to us?

959
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,045
What happened? I...

960
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,319
I mean, we got married
at 23 years old,

961
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,399
I just don't think at that
point you are ready for a life

962
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,001
without excitement or spontaneity.

963
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,731
Spontaneity?

964
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,201
I mean, I'm spontaneous.

965
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,241
We didn't have sex
for almost six months.

966
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,445
You want spontaneous?

967
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,479
- Hey.
- Hi.

968
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,159
- Are you sick or something?
- No.

969
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,639
Those aren't going out clothes.

970
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,119
Well, who's going out?

971
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,084
I thought we were going out.

972
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,126
BOTH: Oh!

973
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,079
- That was pretty badass.
- Mmm-hmm.

974
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,850
I can get fired for that shit.

975
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,199
You know, when I was a kid, I
used to love going to parks.

976
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,361
And my grandfather
used to take me every Sunday.

977
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,279
But my ex hated parks.

978
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,999
He thought they were
like too public or something.

979
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,959
He sounds like a real dick.

980
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,199
What? My ex?

981
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,479
Your grandfather.

(LAUGHING)

983
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,641
So what happened
between the two of you?

984
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,719
Well, I graduated from school
and I moved to New York.

985
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,199
And he took a job in Chicago.

986
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:13,009
And it was sort of like a
focus-on-your-work-life-first sort of thing.

987
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,682
They call us
the selfish generation.

988
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,005
What about you?

989
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,042
Who's the one that got you?

990
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,759
How dare you assume that I have

991
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,719
any emotional capacity whatsoever?

992
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,319
- Get out of my park.
- No.

993
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,090
- Get out.
- No.

994
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,088
It's okay. You can come back.

995
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,610
Damn it!

996
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,279
I was so not gonna do that.

997
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,519
I was gonna hold out.

998
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,919
I was gonna make you wait,
like, 40 days or something.

999
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,319
I was gonna make you wait, too,

1000
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,807

Jesus! Fred, you're like
Reverse Elvis, you know.

1004
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,571
Fred, you entered the building.

What's up, Fred?

1008
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,290
Well, Ellie from Simon just sent
over the Matterhorn book cover.

1009
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,319
And she wants us to do it?

1010
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,599
Specifically.

1011
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,799

I'll get in on that.

00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,400
Right.

1015
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,206
Come on.

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,679
- Thanks, Fred.
- Yeah.

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,759
All right.

1018
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,086
Gonna do it!

1019
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,799
Wait, okay, so let me
get this straight.

1020
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,159
You have sex with this girl.
We get a job out of it?

1021
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,359
Certainly seems that way.

1022
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,882
And to think this whole time, we
thought that poor girl was a hooker.

1023
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,519
Well, yeah.

1024
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,719
But in reality, the only
prostitute here is you.

Thank you.

1208
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,203
- Creeped me out.
- Yeah.

1209
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,439
Um...

1210
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,879
Chelsea, I just really
want you to know something.

1211
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,439
And I wanted to be very clear.

1212
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,723
You're not looking for
anything serious right now?

1213
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,642
Look, Daniel, this thing
doesn't have to be a thing.

1214
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,279

back to being friends,

1215
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,199

1238
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,839
If you were gay, would you date me?

1239
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,199
Definitely not.

1240
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,439
- What?
- What?

1241
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,079
I would not date you, Jason.

1242
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:45,799
Why?

1243
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,365

00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,279

1246
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,599
I'm completely offended.

1247
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,086
Deal with it.

1248
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,399
You'd gay date me.
You know you would.

I don't think you should
go to this party, man.

It's gonna be fun.

$60.

1263
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,479
Okay. Look. I'm telling you, man.

1264
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,879
This party is a road
to a relationship.

1265
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,239
And that road is paved with
responsibility and lack of selfishness.

Why would I need an extra balloon?

1271

- In case it pops.
- Why would it pop?

I'm not gonna get old.

1388
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,879
Getting old looks so tiring.

1389
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,439
I know. You just, like,
wake up in the morning

1390
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,119
and have to figure out what
to do in between meals.

1391
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,599
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

1392
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,719
I'm gonna get an old Jaguar
XK-E, completely restored.

1393
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,922
And then I'm gonna
eat a ton of acid.

1394
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,359
Like, so much acid that if you
went to go see Cirque du Soleil,

1395
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,359

were in Connecticut.

(LAUGHING)

1397
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,319
And then I'm gonna speed up
the West Side Highway,

1398
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,639
as fast as a car can go,
crash through the divider,

1399
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,799

What?

1407
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,239
You'll be 70 years old.

1408

1409

25 at best, 15 at worst.

doing in the car in the first place,

wet yourself, ruin the car,

1414
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,519
lose your license, and your
dignity in one fell swoop.

1415
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,279
And then you're gonna be ushered
off into some rest home,

1416
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,359
where you have to
wake up in the mornings,

1417

to do in between meals.

about what she's doing.

1715
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,165
Like, when I'm not there.

1716
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,121
I know what the couch
looks like at her place.

1717
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,519
I just can't stop
imagining the different

1718
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,405
people that are all sitting on it.

1719
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,011
A guy.

1720
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,571
A different guy.

1721
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,560
A new guy.

1722
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,324
Just every guy but me.

1723
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,164
Sitting on that couch.

1724
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,765
Well,

1725
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:13,323
it sounds to me like
you just need to get laid.

1726
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:21,879
(BOTH MOANING)

1727
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,399
I know this is gonna sound crazy.

1728
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,599
- Then don't say it.
- No.

1729
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:28,719
This is gonna sound even more
crazy, given the new information.

1730
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,160
- Shh.
- No, listen.

1731
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,119
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

1732
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,651
Wow. What?

1733
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,726
I'm just still
getting over someone.

1734
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,521
Come on. You're gonna
go full-girl with it?

1735
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:49,967
I think I made a terrible mistake.

1736
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,399
I know I can be selfish, arrogant,

1737
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,439
distant and emotionally retarded.

1738
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,039
I'm just gonna stop
you right there because

1739
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:01,119
whatever it is that you're doing
right now is not what we do.

1740
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,759
I just needed somebody to talk to.

1741
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,200
Jason?

1742
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,688
Don't you have any friends?

1743
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,360
(DOOR CLOSING)

1744
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:41,084
These actually do go together.

1745
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:43,685
Didn't see that coming.

1746
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,840
I'm sorry.

1747
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,001
I know.

1748
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,079
I just...

1749
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,399
I don't know,
to be honest, I'm having

1750
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,639
so much fun hanging out, you know,

1751
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,366
and chasing girls.
And doing the thing and...

1752
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,439
- "Doing the thing"?
- Yeah, I miss that.

1753
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,279
And I'm not gonna be able to
do that if I'm with Chelsea.

1754
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,599
You know that.

1755
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,879
I know.

1756
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,286
Okay.

1757
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,999
Go tell her how you feel.

1758
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,159
Go make a scene.

1759
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,279
Yeah.

1760
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,119
- Make a public spectacle.
- Yeah.

1761
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:20,159
Dude. Go big.
Do it like the movies.

1762
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,239
Like the movies. Yeah.

1763
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,559
- Like <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>
- I love that movie.

1764
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,039
- I love that movie, man!
- So good.

1765
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,439
- "You had me at hello."
- What?

1766
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,959
- Don't ever do that again. Okay
- Sorry.

1767
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,439
But tell me what you
love about her, man!

1768
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,039
- What do you love about her?
- I love the way she laughs.

1769
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,639
I like the way she fake laughs
when she knows that I need it.

1770
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,839
Yes.

1771
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,959
I love the way we
fit together in bed.

1772
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,079
Because we're the same height,
our crotches line up perfectly.

1773
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,159
That's really good.

1774
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,479
I love that about it!

1775
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,679
I mean, what are
the chances, right?

1776
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,999
I love the way that she
looks in the morning.

1777
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,879
Like at that exact moment
when she wakes up,

1778
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,879
and her eyes just open
like two little butterflies.

1779
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,239
- Two little...
- I love that!

1780
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,359
I love that!

1781
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,719
- Yeah, man.
- But I wouldn't go there.

1782
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,359
- Yeah, I wouldn't do that.
- Okay.

1783
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:54,559
- So run and tell her that.
- I'm gonna go.

1784
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,199
Don't go all <i>Notebook</i> with it.
But run and tell her that.

1785
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,519
- I'm doing it.
- Do it.

1786
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:58,599
- I'm doing it.
- Do it, man.

1787
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,799
- I'm going.
- Let's do it.

1788
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:00,879
I'm gonna do it!

1789
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,081
Man, you're doing it!

1790
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,159
- (HORN HONKING)
- Oh, shit!

1791
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,044
Oh, my God!

1792
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,045
- Dude?
- MAN: Someone call 911!

1793
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,479
You took, like, four bags of fluid.
You were severely dehydrated.

1794
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,841
Oop!

1795
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,929
- You need to be housebroken.
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1796
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:23,559
I mean, what the hell
were you doing?

1797
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:24,879
I was running.

1798
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:25,999
Why?

1799
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,440
Because I...

1800
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,639
I'm sorry.

1801
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:32,281
I'm really, really sorry. I was
running to tell you that I'm sorry.

1802
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,520
And I should have told these
guys that we were dating.

1803
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,199
From the beginning,
I told him that.

1804
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,925
We tried to convince
him the whole time.

1805
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,807
I want to date you, Chels.

1806
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,760
Like... Like, really date you.

1807
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,084
I want that, too.

1808
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,281
Oh!

1809
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,324
You're such an idiot.

1810
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,245

I was wondering if you'd call.</i>

01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,559
<i>I'd love to see you.</i>

1814
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,599
No, seriously, that took forever.

1816
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,809
I'd love to see you again.

Ah! That's what I'm talking about.

1818
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,359

I mean, honestly,
I just find it disgusting.

1832
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,519
The way that you guys
embrace the single life.

1833
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,079

all of two minutes.

And he is already
a righteous asshole.

in love and shit.

time to sit and realize

how disgusting both of you are.

- MIKEY: What about me?

You're the worst. You're
pretty disgusting, too.

- You're gross.
- I'm a killer.

What the... Did you...

1844
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:26,679
Did you post a funny
video on Ellie's wall?

01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,039
No.

1846
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:31,639
Yes, you did, because I'm
looking at it right now, Jason!

1847
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,839
What is it, funny cute?
Or is it just funny?

1848
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,079
It is funny cute! Jason, you pussy!

1849
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,839
You funny cute videoed her?

I... Yes. I guess.
I don't freaking know...

I don't know what I'm doing, man.

1852
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,119
Hey, man. I think he loves her.

1853
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,279
I think that's love!

1854
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,399
It sounds like love to me.

1855
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,519
I don't know, man.
I don't know. Maybe I do.

MIKEY:
What do you mean, you don't know?

1857
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:54,959
- Well, then you have to tell her.
- DANIEL: You have to.

1858
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:56,479
- It'll be funny cute.
- Maybe I should tell her.

1859
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,959
Which is right up your alley.
You love that shit.

Ha, ha, ha. Asshole.

01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,079
I don't even know where to...

1862
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,439
What's she doing? Let's stop by her place.
Where's she at right now?

1863
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,881
Third Tuesday of the month.
She's at one of her readings.

1864

Whoa. That... That was
some stalker shit.

1865
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,119
That's creepy.

1866
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,479
It's creepy that you know that.

MIKEY: I mean, does anybody go?

1868
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,119
No! Nobody ever goes.

- DANIEL: Nobody ever shows up?
- Nobody.

1870
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,001
Well, then, you are
going to be the guy

1871
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,409

From my novel.

1885
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,719
It's not really the kind of place

1886
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,039

from your own work.

1887
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,402
Thank you very much.
Honor to be here.

1888
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,040

- Um...

1889
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,086

(SIGHS)

1895
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,799
And then the other guy
asked to buy her a drink,

1896
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,525
right as Jason walked up.

1897
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,280
And so she asked that guy,

1898
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,523
"What happens
if I enjoy the drink?"

1899
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,446
"What happens then?"

1900
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:56,004
And he pretended not to know
the answer. So she told him.

1901
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:58,959
She asked if they
would play beer pong

1902
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,519
in that shitty bar with his friends

1903
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,405
until they headed back to
his place in Murray Hill.

1904
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,559
She asked if they'd have to
listen to his roommate

1905
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,969
fuck Hilary or Emily,
or whatever her name was

1906
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,645
till they fell asleep.

1907
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,639
And she asked him if a year later,

1908
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,763
they'd still be there in that bar.

1909
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,806
The only difference being that now
he feels pressure to get married

1910
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:25,688
and have kids, because he thinks
that that's what she wants.

1911
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,005
And then in the summers,

1912
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:31,323
they would drive up
to the shitty Hamptons.

1913
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,287
To meet his shitty parents.

1914
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,325
Wondering the entire ride if they'd
think that she was pretty enough.

1915
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,561
Smart.

1916
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,366
Wondering the entire ride if
they think she's smart enough.

1917
01:26:44,160 --> 01:26:45,519
Because no one was.

1918
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,563
And no one ever will be.

1919
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:55,564
And Jason knew that now.

1920
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:01,690
And he would give anything
to go back to that moment.

1921
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:07,606
The moment where they first met.
Before anything went wrong.

1922
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:14,086
Before he didn't show up for
her when she needed him most.

1923
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,239
Before he understood that
being there for somebody

1924
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:20,808
when it's most difficult is really
all that relationships are.

1925
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,045
Jason knew that now.

1926
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:30,210
And he was so sorry
for what he had done.

1927
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,761
But Jason also realized
that in that moment,

1928
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:41,603
he wasn't afraid, because he

1929
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,683
thought she wasn't the one.

1930
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,522
He was absolutely terrified,
because he knew she was.

1931
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:59,082
And if she could give him
just one more chance,

1932
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,763
just one more chance,

1933
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,124
she knew where to find him.
