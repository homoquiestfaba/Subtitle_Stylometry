00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,405
# I'm forkin' on it #

2
00:00:45,405 --> 00:00:49,909
# For I've lived all
my blue days that I need #

3
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:55,917
# Oh, baby,
I've learned how to care #

4
00:00:55,917 --> 00:01:00,923
# And never really loved
oh, my, my #

00:01:00,923 --> 00:01:03,926
# And I'm the world's
most happy creature #

6
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:06,930
# Tell me what
could worry me #

7
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,432
# I'm crazy 'bout my baby #

8
00:01:09,432 --> 00:01:11,935
# And my baby's
crazy 'bout me, yeah #

9
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:24,450
# Oh, Mr. Cupid
was my teacher #

10
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,953
# On one reason we agree #

11
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,458
# I'm crazy 'bout my baby
and my baby's crazy 'bout me, yeah #

12
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:36,463
# Whoa, possum,

13
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,466
# Get that book out #

14
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:42,470
# Hold it steady,
steady in your hand #

15
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,973
# Understand
an a-1 combination #

16
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:47,476
# Perfect he and she #

17
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:51,982
# I'm crazy 'bout my baby
and my baby's so crazy 'bout me #

18
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:15,008
# Whoa, possum

19
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:19,013
# Hold it steady

20
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,765
# Look out you
can't understand #

21
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:26,271
# It's an a-1 combination
a perfect he and she #

22
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,773
# Oh, I'm crazy
'bout my baby #

# And my baby's

24
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:53,168
I got, I got to clean
right there.

25
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:55,171
Right where
you're standing.

26
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:32,714
<i>I was lookin'
all over for you.</i>

27
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:37,720
<i>Vera said you
were getting out today.</i>

28
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:51,235
Well, you look good,
other than your hair.

29
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:56,241
'Course, I should talk, huh?

30
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:03,249
Tell you what. There's
a cafe across the street.

31
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:07,754
Why don't, you go over there
and get us a table by a window?

32
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:13,762
Go on. I'll meet
you over there.

33
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:27,277
Go on.

34
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:29,279
I'll meet ya.

35
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:52,556
<i>Thank you. Now boarding through
door five. Service to Seattle.</i>

36
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:56,561
Can I have five-dollars'
worth of those lotto tickets, please?

37
00:04:58,062 --> 00:05:00,065
Thank you.

38
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:10,576
<i>Bus number seven is now
ready for boarding with service...</i>

39
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,580
<i>to Spokane, Washington.</i>

40
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,082
Yeah, see ya again.
Thank you, sir.

41
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:46,619
Come outta there!

42
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:49,121
That was a dirty
little con you pulled.

43
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:53,126
- You tried to ditch me back there.
- You can't strong-arm me.

44
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:56,129
Come outta there!

45
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:11,648
It's a holiday.

46
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:21,158
- Millie's birthday.
- How old is she?

47
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:24,162
Three.

48
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:30,670
Looks like she's put on some weight.
How much she weigh now?

49
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,172
175 pounds.

50
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:46,687
I'm not goin' back.

51
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:49,691
Listen, you can
weep and wallow,

52
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:53,195
but I wouldn't be doin' you
no favors if I kept you with me.

53
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:54,650
# I was talkin'
to a lady #

54
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,154
# Just a few days ago #

55
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:05,278
# And these are
the words she said #

56
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:07,914
# Oh, Lord #

57
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:10,417
<i>Hey, I'll go
and check this out.</i>

58
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,424
Hey, baby, what's up?

59
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:18,677
# Tell him I'm waiting
for my child #

60
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:21,430
- Thank you.
# To come home #

61
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:26,185
<i># To come home #
- You play fair or hardball, Mr. Normandy?</i>

62
00:08:26,185 --> 00:08:29,689
That depends on you.
you're a middleweight criminal,

63
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:34,195
and I'm hopin' for your sake,
you're retirin'. - I'm seriously considering it.

64
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:37,198
This early release is a
six-month conditional period, Jack.

65
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:40,202
<i>if I think it's more
than you can handle,</i>

66
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:43,705
<i>I'll send you back to serve out
your time, one year. - Ten months, sir.</i>

67
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,712
<i>Says here, you
got a son, Nick.</i>

68
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:52,215
<i>- What about him?
- Where's he at?</i>

69
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:56,720
He's livin' with my sister, Vera,
on her farm. He loves it over there.

70
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:59,724
He's a, you know, hick "4-her",

71
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:02,227
cows and peas
and all that.

72
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:04,229
<i>Maybe that's best for now.</i>

73
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:09,735
- Lookin' for a job?
- I sent over 152 letters asking for one.

74
00:09:10,236 --> 00:09:13,240
- Didn't get no reply.
- Special skills?

75
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,242
No, I can't do nothin'.

76
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:18,245
Well, here's an opening
for a window washer.

77
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:22,250
- They hire ex-cons?
- They might.

78
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,252
Can I bum one
of your cigarettes?

79
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:27,756
<i>Yeah, get one but don't
make no habit out of it.</i>

80
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:31,260
<i>Keep your piss clean.
Maybe you'll make it on the outside.</i>

81
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,763
You won't get
no trouble from me.

82
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:36,266
I plan to come through
just like a giant.

83
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,771
- Be strong, brother.
- Yes, sir.

84
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:43,274
Because you're his aunt.

85
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:46,278
He's a part of you.
You still got my shoes over there?

86
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,783
Yeah. well, bring 'em
when you come collect the kid.

87
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:53,787
Yeah. I'm over at Rainey's,
913 spruce.

88
00:09:58,793 --> 00:10:00,795
Shit.

89
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:03,297
<i>- That my jacket?
- That's my jacket, man.</i>

90
00:10:03,297 --> 00:10:07,802
<i>- No, come on. I need this.
- I had this jacket for five years, man.</i>

91
00:10:07,803 --> 00:10:11,307
It don't even fit
you no more.

92
00:10:11,307 --> 00:10:14,310
- That's your old man, right there.
- I feel like a human being.

93
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:18,815
Yeah. How about my end?

94
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:20,818
Where's my end, Rainey?

95
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:23,821
Your end?

96
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,825
You're sittin' on it, Jack.

97
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:30,328
No, I... yeah,
I got somethin' for ya.

98
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:32,331
Just a second.

99
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:56,608
Let's see.

100
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:59,613
That's $200, not much.

101
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:02,616
Yeah, I can get ya another
$200 tomorrow, man, but...

102
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:04,619
it's the best I can do.

103
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:07,121
Two-hundred.

104
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:10,625
- For a six large haul.
- That was five years ago, Jack.

105
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:15,130
That's taking into account all kinds
of costs over a five-year period.

106
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:25,142
I was real sad to see you take the fall, Jack.
I'm grateful you didn't give me up.

107
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,644
Hardly worth it for
four stinkin' c-notes.

108
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,148
Yeah.
So where you at, Jack?

109
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,151
You up for some action,
or you walkin' spanish?

110
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,657
I haven't even passed my last
prison meal yet, Rainey.

111
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:42,161
Yeah, sometimes
I think about givin' it up.

112
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:45,165
But it's like they say,
it's in the blood, ya know?

113
00:11:45,165 --> 00:11:47,667
The way I figure, man,

114
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:51,172
you're either the doer
or the do-ee.

115
00:11:54,676 --> 00:11:57,179
Hey.

116
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:00,682
I cased out a jewelry store
up on Pill Hill, man.

117
00:12:00,683 --> 00:12:03,687
Very sweet. Security guard
is deaf and blind.

118
00:12:03,687 --> 00:12:06,690
Keep it to yourself.

119
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,694
<i>I ain't interested.</i>

120
00:12:09,694 --> 00:12:12,697
<i>Younger generation takin' over?</i>

121
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:15,701
I ain't lookin'
for a new partner.

122
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:19,204
You remember me, kid?

123
00:12:19,204 --> 00:12:21,707
Geez.
Don't remember me.

124
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:25,712
I boosted flowers from the hospital
grounds when you were born, man.

125
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:29,216
I been there from the beginning, man.
Kind of makes us like brothers.

126
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:32,719
He's just hanging out. Fact, Vera
and Larry's comin' to collect him tonight.

127
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,724
Larry's a dick.
I ain't goin' back.

128
00:12:35,724 --> 00:12:38,226
I'm sendin' for ya
when I get myself settled.

129
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:41,230
You can't expect to walk out of
the joint and live a normal life.

130
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,233
- Bullshit.
- What do you mean, bullshit?

131
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:46,735
You never get settled, Jack.

132
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:55,246
What's the matter
with Vera's anyway?

133
00:12:55,246 --> 00:12:58,249
You got fresh air,
that pig of a friend.

134
00:12:58,249 --> 00:13:00,752
Come on.
Be a stand-up, kid. God.

135
00:13:00,753 --> 00:13:03,756
Vera did a lousy job raisin' you.

136
00:13:05,257 --> 00:13:07,260
Here. Present
from your old man.

137
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,262
Jack London.

138
00:13:30,403 --> 00:13:32,405
Maybe Vera got lost.

139
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:45,420
Is that the only
razor you got?

140
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,424
I got one face,
I got one razor.

141
00:13:48,424 --> 00:13:51,927
So, what are we doin' today?

142
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,930
Here.

143
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,432
Take the bus
back to Mount Vernon.

144
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:02,940
Good to see ya, kid.

145
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:18,842
Hey.

146
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:20,845
Where's that ferry goin'?

147
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:23,165
You got a room?

148
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:26,670
- Sixty-five a week.
Is it just you? - Yeah.

149
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:37,550
<i>If there's another person,
that's an extra ten.</i>

150
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:46,059
Rent's due every friday.
don't be late.

151
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:49,562
I get very upset.
I break out in a rash.

152
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:52,066
That's okay.
I'll still like ya.

153
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:15,092
Now you're gonna follow
my three rules to a tee.

154
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:17,595
Don't tail me, shadow me..

155
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:21,099
or any way, shape
or form jam me.

156
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:25,738
And don't ask me
to hold your stinkin' hand.

157
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:28,240
'Cause I don't need
the aggravation.

158
00:16:28,241 --> 00:16:32,246
- Don't let Rainey in here
or hang out with him. - That's five.

159
00:17:14,044 --> 00:17:16,047
<i>Hey.</i>

160
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:18,049
<i>Help me with this.</i>

161
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:22,554
Grab on to that.

162
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:24,556
Pull it. Pull it!

163
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:34,067
All right, we're gonna shoot
to see who gets what.

164
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:36,570
- What you got,
odds or even? - Odds.

165
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,572
One, two, three.

166
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,584
The mattress.

167
00:17:57,094 --> 00:17:59,596
Get outta the way!

168
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,103
Thanks.

169
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:26,126
I saw a cow give birth
last week.

170
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:28,630
I'm sleepin'.

171
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,142
See ya in the mornin'.

172
00:19:57,215 --> 00:19:59,718
<i>what are we doin' today?</i>

173
00:19:59,718 --> 00:20:02,721
I'm goin' to work.
you're goin' to school.

174
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:04,724
What school?

175
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:07,226
I don't know. Find one.

176
00:20:33,507 --> 00:20:35,509
Yes?

177
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:38,012
I need to sign up for school.

178
00:20:38,013 --> 00:20:40,515
- Did you just move here?
- Yeah.

179
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:44,520
You have your transcripts
from your old school?

180
00:20:46,022 --> 00:20:48,024
Your immunization
records?

181
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:54,531
You got some stuff to do
before you can register.

182
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:28,320
Well, certain places don't
work out for certain people.

183
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,324
Since this last time
in the joint, I been thinkin'.

184
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:34,327
- About what?
- Climbin' up to the roof of the world.

185
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,832
- Where's that?
- Alaska.

186
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:44,339
Ever since I was a kid,
I dreamed about Alaska.

187
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:46,341
I never knew that.

188
00:21:46,341 --> 00:21:49,845
- This time I aim
to make it up there. - When?

189
00:21:49,845 --> 00:21:52,848
Well, if I get through
parole, springtime.

190
00:21:57,354 --> 00:21:59,356
I wish we had binoculars.

191
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,363
What'll you do
up there, Jack?

192
00:22:05,363 --> 00:22:08,867
I'll buy some entrepreneurial
type enterprise...

193
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:11,870
steak 'n' bake.

194
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,990
You know,
catch a meal, bring a reel.

195
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:19,996
Perpetratin' cons isn't
the only business there is.

196
00:22:19,996 --> 00:22:24,501
Didn't work out for me here,
but up there's gonna be different.

197
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:28,507
Man can get a fair shake without
everybody breathing down his neck.

198
00:22:28,507 --> 00:22:31,009
Well...

199
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,512
I never really thought
about Alaska.

200
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:36,516
That's because
it's my dream.

201
00:22:36,516 --> 00:22:38,518
It's not yours.

202
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:43,523
What kind of job are
you workin' downtown, Jack?

203
00:22:43,524 --> 00:22:46,026
Buildin' supervisor.

204
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:50,031
I'd like to do that.

205
00:22:50,031 --> 00:22:53,034
You're gonna get yourself
an education.

206
00:22:55,037 --> 00:22:58,540
'Course... without one,
a man of my own technology,

207
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:01,545
I made whole bunches
of money.

208
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:04,047
Several fortunes spent.

209
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:09,053
Well, I'll be makin'
big money real soon.

210
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:11,555
Real big money.
You got a quarter on ya?

211
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,059
I think so.

212
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:21,568
<i>"Farwest."
An old pen pal.</i>

213
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,570
<i>7-7-0-0.</i>

214
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,576
I wonder what
she looks like.

215
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:32,581
Yeah,
is Charlotte there?

216
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:35,083
Rowe?
Charlotte Rowe?

217
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:38,086
She works there, right?

218
00:23:38,587 --> 00:23:40,590
A friend.

219
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,596
Can you tell me where
she hangs out then?

220
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:50,100
All right.
Yeah, thank you.

221
00:24:05,368 --> 00:24:08,371
Hit the ball, Charlotte.

222
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:10,873
Shut up, Flo, shut up.

223
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:14,879
Next.

224
00:24:23,388 --> 00:24:26,392
Rack 'em up?

225
00:24:26,392 --> 00:24:28,894
I'm in the middle
of a shift.

226
00:24:28,895 --> 00:24:30,897
Come on.
It's your break.

227
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,902
I'm not in the middle
of a shift.

228
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:38,406
You're in the middle
of something.

229
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:13,947
I'm a little... rusty at this.

230
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:15,949
This whole scene.

231
00:25:38,976 --> 00:25:41,478
"Bam, a piss-cold pittake,

232
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:43,481
a white fang."

233
00:25:53,492 --> 00:25:56,496
Vernon, I want
a diet coke to go.

234
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:02,002
You don't know
how many times I've...

235
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:04,505
dreamed of sittin'
here like this.

236
00:26:04,505 --> 00:26:07,007
About a million times.

237
00:26:07,008 --> 00:26:09,011
Man, what a line.

238
00:26:10,512 --> 00:26:12,514
Watch out for this one.

239
00:26:14,016 --> 00:26:17,520
- I'm not tryin' to hustle you.
- But you're hittin' 'em all.

240
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:22,026
Next thing you'll be sayin' is,
"Don't I know you from somewhere?"

241
00:26:24,028 --> 00:26:26,530
Yep. Can I... can I see...

242
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,533
For cryin' all night!

243
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:34,539
Let me guess, a unicorn?

244
00:26:37,543 --> 00:26:40,546
What are you, are you
some kind of psychic?

245
00:26:40,546 --> 00:26:44,050
They say...

246
00:26:44,051 --> 00:26:47,054
the eyes are
the windows of the soul...

247
00:26:48,556 --> 00:26:50,558
and I'm into windows.

248
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:57,566
- Where ya goin'?
- I told ya. Back to work.

249
00:26:57,566 --> 00:27:00,569
- Well, when can I see you again?
- You tell me, Mr. Psychic.

250
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:03,072
You mind payin' the tab here?

251
00:27:22,095 --> 00:27:25,598
Well...

252
00:27:25,598 --> 00:27:27,601
see ya.

253
00:27:31,105 --> 00:27:33,107
Meter's on!

254
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,125
<i>Unit 105, you want that
fare on first avenue, or what?</i>

255
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,628
Unit 105. oh, don't.

256
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,631
<i>Don't what, 105?</i>

257
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:56,634
You start touchin' on me
and you think the sky's the limit.

258
00:27:56,634 --> 00:28:00,639
<i>105, I'm not touchin' you and
you're walkin' on my transmission.</i>

259
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:03,141
<i>you want that fare
on first avenue or what, 105?</i>

260
00:28:03,142 --> 00:28:06,646
Do you think
I'm an easy night?

261
00:28:06,646 --> 00:28:09,148
You're right.
I'm pushin' this.

262
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:13,654
- You do?
- What, think you're an easy night?

263
00:28:13,654 --> 00:28:16,657
You wanna come
up for a beer?

264
00:28:16,657 --> 00:28:18,659
I can't.

265
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,663
You're right in the
middle of a shift.

266
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:27,170
Oh, God.

267
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:35,179
Who's that?

268
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,683
Nick?

269
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,185
This is Charlotte.
Come on.

270
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,188
<i>- Is that your...
- Yeah.</i>

271
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,692
<i>- You didn't tell me
you had a kid. - I forgot.</i>

272
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:49,194
My kid's been with relatives.

273
00:28:51,698 --> 00:28:54,701
Hey, there's an all night...

274
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:57,204
A & W down the block.

275
00:28:57,204 --> 00:29:00,208
Here. It's open all night.

276
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:05,214
You want me to bring
you back a root beer?

277
00:29:07,716 --> 00:29:11,220
<i>Just take your time.</i>

278
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:14,724
I might. And I might
just come right back.

279
00:29:14,724 --> 00:29:18,228
And I might take you
to a goddamn home.

280
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:33,746
This doesn't
really feel right.

281
00:29:33,746 --> 00:29:36,749
Don't worry 'bout him.
He's used to it.

282
00:29:40,254 --> 00:29:44,259
Come on. let's get
a couple of beers, relax.

283
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:46,761
What kind of a father are ya?

284
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:51,767
Oh, I'm probably the worst kind,
but I make up for it in other ways.

285
00:29:51,767 --> 00:29:54,770
God, you are a big talker.

286
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:58,274
- Where ya goin'?
- This doesn't feel right.

287
00:29:58,275 --> 00:30:01,778
So can I see ya tomorrow?

288
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,282
<i>I'll get a baby-sitter.</i>

289
00:30:04,782 --> 00:30:06,784
I'll catch ya next time.

290
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:26,307
Gimme back my money.

291
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:29,561
Man, I was trippin'
so fierce yesterday, man,

292
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:33,064
I thought my heart was just
gonna go boom, right outta my ears.

293
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:36,069
Yeah, I had
a heart attack once.

294
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:39,205
I was running away
from my uncle.

295
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:41,707
- Name's Rollie, man.
- Nick.

296
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,711
Later on.

297
00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:59,728
Stop it, Roy. I'm gonna roast you.
Not you, Creamo. Come here.

298
00:30:59,729 --> 00:31:04,234
You're getting me
all jacked up, Roy!

299
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:06,736
She likes me,
don't you, Creamo?

300
00:31:06,737 --> 00:31:09,741
She likes anybody.
Stop it, Roy!

301
00:31:09,741 --> 00:31:12,744
- She's got sheepdog in her.
- How do you know?

302
00:31:12,744 --> 00:31:16,749
Oh, the shape of her paw,
her coat.

303
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,753
- Could be a herder.
-It's starting, Molly!

304
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,757
<i>Who's there?</i>

305
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:25,759
My crib's upstairs.

306
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,761
You sleep in a crib?

307
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:31,265
So what was it you wanted?

308
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,270
Do you subscribe
to the post?

309
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,273
<i>Celeste had her abortion!</i>

310
00:31:50,788 --> 00:31:53,791
- You need help up there?
- Yeah.

311
00:31:58,797 --> 00:32:01,300
Hey, you gonna go
to school, man?

312
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,303
I don't see the point
in perpetrating that.

313
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:07,307
Yeah, I dropped out
in sixth grade.

314
00:32:07,307 --> 00:32:10,310
My parents made me
go back, though. It sucks.

315
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,814
- What does your father do?
- He just got a job in construction.

316
00:32:14,315 --> 00:32:16,817
What'd he do before that?

317
00:32:16,818 --> 00:32:19,320
He was in the penitentiary.

318
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,823
What for?

319
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:24,326
He robbed some banks,
I think.

320
00:32:24,326 --> 00:32:28,331
A bank robber?

321
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:34,338
Hey, Jack. how ya
doin', man?  Long time.

322
00:32:34,338 --> 00:32:36,840
Listen, I... come on around!

323
00:32:36,841 --> 00:32:40,846
I wanted to talk to you about that
jewelry store, man, get some advice.

324
00:32:40,846 --> 00:32:45,350
- Yeah, well, my advice is get
yourself a new partner. - Come on, Jack.

325
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,854
Let me give ya a lift, ride shotgun.

326
00:32:48,855 --> 00:32:51,557
I got wheels, man.

327
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:57,063
Come on around!

328
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:59,567
Asshole.

329
00:33:55,498 --> 00:33:59,002
<i>Get out!
Get outta this house!</i>

330
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:01,504
<i>- I'm leaving!
- Good!</i>

331
00:34:01,505 --> 00:34:03,507
<i>Go to hell!</i>

332
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:10,514
Homeboy, you got
an extra crib?

333
00:34:38,548 --> 00:34:40,550
Nick!

334
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:10,084
<i>Jack, you in there?
Jack?</i>

335
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:16,091
- Hey, come on, get up.
- What?

336
00:35:18,093 --> 00:35:21,596
Out the window!

337
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:24,851
I ain't goin' out no window.

338
00:35:25,286 --> 00:35:28,082
<i>Jack, open up!
Jack, Cecil Normandy!</i>

339
00:35:28,471 --> 00:35:29,782
Just don't open it.

340
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:32,645
<i>I got the landlady here.
She's got the key.</i>

341
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:42,621
Oh, God. This is a shame.

342
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:46,125
- Thank you, ma'am. I can
handle it from here. - Makes me sick.

343
00:35:47,627 --> 00:35:51,131
I... I can explain this,
Normandy.

344
00:35:54,134 --> 00:35:57,138
Wha... what, do you think
I'm a pervert?

345
00:35:57,138 --> 00:36:00,641
Datin' 16-year-olds is one thing,
but she's 12 if she's a day.

346
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:03,646
- I'm 15. - Fifteen will
get him 20. Stay put.

347
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:07,032
Normandy, I... I wasn't
in the rack with her.

348
00:36:07,033 --> 00:36:11,038
- I never even seen her before.
- What'd you do, black out?

349
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:13,407
See, it's my kid.

350
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:15,910
<i>I thought
you had a son.</i>

351
00:36:17,295 --> 00:36:20,298
- Turn around, Jack.
- Normandy, please.

352
00:36:20,298 --> 00:36:23,302
- Get 'em up.
- Man, don't bust me.

353
00:36:23,302 --> 00:36:26,305
What do you expect, man?
You missed your appointment yesterday.

354
00:36:26,305 --> 00:36:28,808
You don't show up
at work today.

355
00:36:28,808 --> 00:36:32,311
<i>And I come to your place,
and you drunk with a minor...</i>

356
00:36:32,312 --> 00:36:35,816
<i>in the middle of the day.</i>

357
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:40,320
Dad, this is Molly.

358
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:42,824
This is my parole officer.

359
00:36:42,824 --> 00:36:46,327
Somebody tell me what
the hell's goin' on here.

360
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:49,832
She lives downstairs and she
needed a place to sleep last night.

361
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,334
I'm bailin'.
Creamo, come on.

362
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:54,338
<i>Hey!</i>

363
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:58,342
I thought your son
was stayin' at your sister's.

364
00:36:58,342 --> 00:37:01,346
Well, we're workin'
on a relationship kind of thing.

365
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:04,349
- I figured, why "pronasticate"?
- Procrastinate.

366
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:07,353
So why'd you miss
the appointment?

367
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:13,860
He was helping me
register for school.

368
00:37:14,361 --> 00:37:16,363
That's... that's right.

369
00:37:16,363 --> 00:37:19,867
My kid's gotta get
an education.

370
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:22,870
<i>What high school
did you put him in?</i>

371
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,873
"Garfield".

372
00:37:25,873 --> 00:37:28,376
That's right.

373
00:37:28,377 --> 00:37:31,880
You're not gonna arrest
him, sir, are ya?

374
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:35,384
We're just starting out.
He's a real good guy.

375
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:39,390
<i>I need to know
you can handle this.</i>

376
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,892
I can handle this.

377
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:45,395
- You sure you can handle this?
- Yes, sir.

378
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:04,034
Get outta the way.

379
00:38:28,062 --> 00:38:30,564
Jack, you better mind
how you go.

380
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:32,568
Yes, sir.

381
00:38:32,568 --> 00:38:35,571
See ya in my office in a week.

382
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:38,575
And you take care,
little brother.

383
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:48,085
We got outta that jam, huh?

384
00:38:48,085 --> 00:38:52,974
I wouldn't have been in it in the
first place if it wasn't for you.

385
00:38:52,974 --> 00:38:57,479
<i>If I wasn't drinking,
I could have handled it myself just fine.</i>

386
00:38:58,981 --> 00:39:03,485
P.O.'s got his thumb on me.
I gotta walk a line. You understand that?

387
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,992
Shit.

388
00:39:12,497 --> 00:39:16,501
My life would be
a hell of a lot easier without you.

389
00:39:18,504 --> 00:39:20,506
Are you gonna dump me?

390
00:39:29,015 --> 00:39:33,020
- You really goin'
to school? - Yeah, sure.

391
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,525
How come I never see no love
notes from your teacher then?

392
00:39:37,526 --> 00:39:40,028
I leave 'em in my locker.

393
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:43,032
Molly! Molly!

394
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:46,035
Take Roy!
I have to work!

395
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:48,537
Kids. Jesus!

396
00:39:48,538 --> 00:39:51,041
What can you do?

397
00:39:54,545 --> 00:39:58,550
You just gotta know what
you're doin', I guess.

398
00:40:03,556 --> 00:40:06,559
- You been hangin' out
with her? - No.

399
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:10,564
You pissin' on my leg and tellin'
me it's rainin', farm boy?

400
00:40:10,564 --> 00:40:14,568
- You're not ready for these streets.
- You fucking little selfish tramp!

401
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:18,072
<i>- I'm selfish. - Yeah, selfish.
- You're just jealous...</i>

402
00:40:18,072 --> 00:40:22,077
<i>because you're old and
you're used up, and you're ugly.</i>

403
00:40:23,078 --> 00:40:26,081
You stick with school.

404
00:40:26,582 --> 00:40:28,585
Here, hold that.

405
00:40:28,585 --> 00:40:32,589
You don't have to take math
or science or any of that crap.

406
00:40:34,591 --> 00:40:38,596
Now, cooking. There.
Now that's a skill.

407
00:40:40,097 --> 00:40:42,100
you could...

408
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,104
be a banquet captain
or some such thing.

409
00:40:46,104 --> 00:40:48,607
or a writer... Jack London.

410
00:40:48,608 --> 00:40:51,110
- He graduated high school,
I think. - You didn't.

411
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:56,116
Never mind about me. You want to wind
up in the joint and a hand like me?

412
00:40:56,116 --> 00:40:59,619
How about being the first in the
family to make it past ninth grade?

413
00:41:01,623 --> 00:41:04,125
I tell you one thing.

414
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:06,127
You got good timing.

415
00:41:06,628 --> 00:41:10,633
Could have died of old age in the joint
before Normandy sorted that one out.

416
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:13,135
So I'm not goin' to a home?

417
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:17,641
You're here, ain't ya?

418
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,645
Are you anywhere else?
No, you're here.

419
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:37,030
Yep. It's not easy
being green, is it?

420
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,532
Hey, man.

421
00:41:39,532 --> 00:41:42,035
I got you right here.

422
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,543
<i>Well, my brother says
he'd pick us up tonight.</i>

423
00:42:04,445 --> 00:42:07,449
Hey, baby.
You lookin' for a date?

424
00:42:07,449 --> 00:42:10,452
I know what
you're lookin' for.

425
00:42:13,956 --> 00:42:16,959
<i>Look at Perry.</i>

426
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,462
- How ya doin'?
- All right.

427
00:42:19,463 --> 00:42:21,965
- What do you want,
the works? - Yeah.

428
00:42:21,965 --> 00:42:24,467
Let me see your dick.

429
00:42:43,857 --> 00:42:46,360
I got that baby-sitter.

430
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,363
# Call me up on your telephone #

431
00:42:49,363 --> 00:42:52,867
# And talk to me
for a long, long time #

432
00:42:52,868 --> 00:42:55,370
# Hey, Juanita,
I'm comin' over #

433
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:59,875
# Yeah, pretty baby #
- Beer is in the refrigerator.

434
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:01,878
- Where is your refrigerator?
- It's over here.

435
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:09,386
# Hit the town
and fell in love #

436
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:12,890
- Where's the bed?
- It's right here.

437
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:15,894
I just want you to know
I used to be a virgin.

438
00:43:23,903 --> 00:43:25,906
<i>So...</i>

439
00:43:25,906 --> 00:43:29,409
<i>are you involved
with anybody?</i>

440
00:43:29,409 --> 00:43:31,412
Now's a fine time to ask.

441
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:38,920
Well, I'm just curious.

442
00:43:41,423 --> 00:43:45,928
Well, sort of, yeah.
There is a guy.

443
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:49,933
Beautiful woman like you,
I wouldn't mind bein' in his shoes.

444
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:52,937
Oh, yeah, you might.
He's in prison.

445
00:43:54,438 --> 00:43:56,941
Yeah.

446
00:43:59,444 --> 00:44:02,947
- You know this guy before
he went up? - Not exactly.

447
00:44:02,948 --> 00:44:05,952
You see, there's this...
there's this magazine.

448
00:44:05,952 --> 00:44:08,955
- "American Heart"?
- Yeah.

449
00:44:08,955 --> 00:44:12,960
Magazine that puts you in touch
with your inside main squeeze?

450
00:44:15,462 --> 00:44:19,967
P.O. box 553,
Walla Walla state penitentiary.

451
00:44:19,968 --> 00:44:22,470
You, you son-of-a-bitch!

452
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:25,474
- Wait a minute.
- You pig-dog con man!

453
00:44:25,474 --> 00:44:29,479
All that stuff about seeing into
my soul and that psychic shit.

454
00:44:29,479 --> 00:44:31,981
- Charlotte.
- God, I'm so stupid!

455
00:44:31,982 --> 00:44:34,985
- Charlotte, come on, ease up. - You screwed
me just to check me out, didn't you?

456
00:44:34,985 --> 00:44:37,488
A little test drive, huh?

457
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:39,990
Char...
hey, you didn't visit me.

458
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:42,494
You never gave me
your home address.

459
00:44:42,494 --> 00:44:46,498
I was afraid you wouldn't
wanna go out with me.

460
00:44:46,498 --> 00:44:50,503
All right.
Hey, okay, I'm sorry.

461
00:44:50,503 --> 00:44:54,006
I should have been
up-front with you. Let's start over.

462
00:44:54,007 --> 00:44:57,011
- No.
- Hey, I think you like me.

463
00:44:57,011 --> 00:44:59,013
No.

464
00:44:59,013 --> 00:45:02,017
You expressed yourself
real nice in those letters.

465
00:45:02,017 --> 00:45:04,519
Yeah, well,
they were good.

466
00:45:07,022 --> 00:45:10,026
You made me feel
like a human being.

467
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:05,973
Hey, Nick!

468
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:07,976
Nick!

469
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:10,478
<i>Nick!</i>

470
00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:13,982
Come on down!
I got somethin' for ya!

471
00:46:13,983 --> 00:46:17,486
I'm getting a rash,
Mr. Kelson, a big rash.

472
00:46:17,486 --> 00:46:20,490
Well, that's okay.
I won't think any less of ya.

473
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:23,493
You owe me a month.

474
00:46:23,493 --> 00:46:26,997
- I can give you half that.
- No. That's not good enough.

475
00:46:26,998 --> 00:46:31,002
I want the whole amount.
I'm not gonna be stuck with your kind.

476
00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:35,507
Come on.

477
00:46:39,511 --> 00:46:42,014
- What is it?
- Never mind. Get on.

478
00:47:02,538 --> 00:47:05,040
All right, get over there.

479
00:47:08,545 --> 00:47:11,047
All right.

480
00:47:11,048 --> 00:47:13,051
All right.

481
00:47:23,062 --> 00:47:26,066
What's the matter?
I thought you wanted 'em.

482
00:47:26,066 --> 00:47:28,068
Yeah, I did.

483
00:47:28,068 --> 00:47:32,073
It's kind of expensive
when we're late on the rent.

484
00:47:32,073 --> 00:47:36,577
Don't you have any faith in
your old man? I'll take care of it.

485
00:47:39,448 --> 00:47:42,451
I don't know what's
the matter with you, kid.

486
00:47:42,451 --> 00:47:45,455
That's just it.
You're not a kid.

487
00:47:45,955 --> 00:47:50,459
You're like some loan officer
gloom pussin' around.

488
00:47:53,964 --> 00:47:57,969
Hey, tomorrow's sunday.
What do you wanna do?

489
00:47:57,969 --> 00:48:01,973
When are you gonna teach
me how to play the ukulele?

490
00:48:01,973 --> 00:48:06,478
It's a guitar.
You can learn that anytime.

491
00:48:06,479 --> 00:48:10,867
How'd you like to do somethin'
with a lady friend of mine and me?

492
00:48:10,868 --> 00:48:13,370
She the one
you brought home?

493
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,872
Yeah.

494
00:48:15,873 --> 00:48:18,376
You'll like her.

495
00:48:18,376 --> 00:48:20,378
Here, take a look.

496
00:48:20,378 --> 00:48:22,880
We'll have a beautiful day.

497
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:41,018
- Am I the only one in here who
can't breathe? - All right, Nick.

498
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:44,522
We're gettin' "fixicated" in here.
Open that window.

499
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:48,026
Here.

500
00:48:49,528 --> 00:48:51,030
Is there any ketchup?

501
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:04,545
<i>You're starin' at her like a goddamn
yard bull. That's one fine lady.</i>

502
00:49:04,546 --> 00:49:09,050
- What do you got to say?
- She goin' to Alaska with you?

503
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:14,339
Nobody's goin' with me. Start actin'
like a stand-up kid. Don't aggravate me.

504
00:49:20,848 --> 00:49:22,851
Here.

505
00:49:22,851 --> 00:49:24,853
Here.

506
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:27,855
Thanks, lady.

507
00:49:27,856 --> 00:49:32,862
- Charlotte.
- That's me, lady Charlotte.

508
00:49:35,364 --> 00:49:37,367
Well...

509
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:42,373
best damn hot dog
I ever had.

510
00:49:42,874 --> 00:49:47,879
- Excuse me for eatin' with food in my
mouth. - Pulley Fuss, it's a funny name.

511
00:49:47,879 --> 00:49:51,884
Yeah, french.
Pulley Fusey.

512
00:49:51,884 --> 00:49:54,386
- How much this cost?
- Thirty.

513
00:49:54,386 --> 00:49:56,389
Thirty bucks?

514
00:50:00,393 --> 00:50:03,397
- Here's to you.
- Here's to me.

515
00:50:07,902 --> 00:50:11,406
You like your dogs?
Hey, I'm talkin' to you.

516
00:50:11,406 --> 00:50:14,910
Yeah. Cool.
I like it.

517
00:50:17,413 --> 00:50:20,532
<i>- It don't matter.
- What do you mean, it don't matter?</i>

518
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,422
Get the fuck outta here!
Fuck you, then!

519
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:28,926
- Now tuck and kick. yeah.
- Yeah, you got it.

520
00:50:28,927 --> 00:50:31,930
<i>All right, do it again.</i>

521
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,433
<i>Check out brother's
dope threads.</i>

522
00:50:36,435 --> 00:50:39,438
<i>- What's happenin'?
- Like we just got out.</i>

523
00:50:39,438 --> 00:50:43,443
- You got a cigarette?
- Man, he's down to the curb.

524
00:50:44,945 --> 00:50:47,698
- Why you dissin' me for, Molly?
- Get back, faggot.

525
00:50:47,698 --> 00:50:51,201
I got somethin' for you.
Dancin' around in a two-piece for frat boys.

526
00:50:51,202 --> 00:50:54,706
Pays good. You dance,
I deals. Easy money.

527
00:50:54,706 --> 00:50:57,709
- One, two, three.
- Leave her alone.

528
00:51:00,213 --> 00:51:04,717
<i>- What'd you say, punk?
- I said, leave her alone.</i>

529
00:51:04,717 --> 00:51:07,721
Now what are you doin'
with my skateboard?

530
00:51:09,723 --> 00:51:13,728
<i>Man! Hey, Stony man,
leave the kid alone, Stony.</i>

531
00:51:13,728 --> 00:51:16,731
Fuck you!

532
00:51:16,731 --> 00:51:19,735
- You punk!  Come on!
- I don't wanna hurt you, Freddie.

533
00:51:19,735 --> 00:51:22,738
You don't have
to hurt me, Stony.

534
00:51:25,241 --> 00:51:27,244
Leave him alone!

535
00:51:27,244 --> 00:51:31,248
You can suck the corn outta
my shit, too, you fuckin' punk!

536
00:51:31,248 --> 00:51:33,751
Get the fuck outta here!
Punk!

537
00:51:35,253 --> 00:51:37,755
Get the fuck outta here!

538
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:45,264
Freddie, I could have handled
it if my back wasn't turned.

539
00:51:45,264 --> 00:51:48,268
You gotta watch your back
around here, all right?

540
00:51:48,768 --> 00:51:52,773
Llisten, I been in over
600 fights down here.

541
00:51:52,773 --> 00:51:56,777
My specialty's the hook.
Guess which hand I hook with, huh?

542
00:51:56,777 --> 00:52:00,281
Left's a lot bigger, right?
I hook 'em in the jaw.

543
00:52:02,784 --> 00:52:04,786
- You okay?
- Yeah.

544
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,291
Well, you know, I would
have helped you but...

545
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:13,163
some two guys jumped me and pinned
my arms, man, and one had a knife.

546
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:16,166
I should have stomped on 'em.

547
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,168
Rollie, I'm fine.

548
00:52:20,672 --> 00:52:23,675
My dad hit me with a 9:00
curfew, so I... I gotta go.

549
00:52:23,675 --> 00:52:26,178
Listen...

550
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,682
later on, man.

551
00:52:42,196 --> 00:52:44,699
<i>Hey. Howdy.</i>

552
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,202
Did you have fun today?

553
00:52:47,202 --> 00:52:49,704
What are you makin'?

554
00:52:50,205 --> 00:52:52,708
Tomato soup.
Want some?

555
00:52:52,709 --> 00:52:55,712
Has a bona fide
penitentiary aroma.

556
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:17,237
Did you rob a lot
of banks, Jack?

557
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,245
Why, you think
I'd be good at it?

558
00:53:24,245 --> 00:53:27,248
<i>I was a smart thief.</i>

559
00:53:27,248 --> 00:53:29,250
What did you steal?

560
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:32,755
What, are you
writin' a book?

561
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:39,012
All right.

562
00:53:41,515 --> 00:53:45,019
I was in for the quick score.

563
00:53:45,019 --> 00:53:47,021
Jewelry stores.

564
00:53:47,021 --> 00:53:50,025
<i>In and out.
In one minute, I'd be gone.</i>

565
00:53:50,526 --> 00:53:53,028
You can steal
a lot in a minute.

566
00:53:53,028 --> 00:53:56,532
You can steal a lot
in 30 seconds.

567
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:59,536
When did you start?

568
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:03,040
You don't start out
robbing a jewelry store.

569
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,542
You work your way up.

570
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:09,047
From where?

571
00:54:09,047 --> 00:54:12,050
I stole my first car
when I was 12.

572
00:54:15,053 --> 00:54:18,057
I was just about your age.

573
00:54:18,057 --> 00:54:21,560
I stole this beautiful,
brand-new maroon Chevrolet.

574
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:24,565
Rode that baby
all the way to coos bay.

575
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:27,568
Two inches off
the ground with girls.

576
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:30,071
<i>Gave it a while,
I got pretty good at it.</i>

577
00:54:32,574 --> 00:54:36,078
If I ever catch you with your
fingers where they don't belong...

578
00:54:36,078 --> 00:54:39,581
- Yeah? - I'll string you
up by your short hairs.

579
00:54:39,582 --> 00:54:42,085
What are you worried
about me for?

580
00:54:42,085 --> 00:54:46,089
Yeah, you got that right.
I got enough to worry about.

581
00:54:46,089 --> 00:54:48,592
Things could be
different for you.

582
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,103
- What's the matter?
What happened? - Nothing.

583
00:54:58,103 --> 00:55:01,107
- Well, come here.
Let me see. - I said nothing.

584
00:55:01,107 --> 00:55:03,609
- Let me see.
- Ouch!

585
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,612
Nothing?

586
00:55:07,113 --> 00:55:09,616
Come here.

587
00:55:09,617 --> 00:55:11,619
There you go.

588
00:55:11,619 --> 00:55:14,623
That's it. All right.
Okay, okay, okay. Turn around.

589
00:55:16,124 --> 00:55:19,127
All right, put your hands up.

590
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:22,631
That's it.
Now chin down.

591
00:55:22,632 --> 00:55:25,134
There you go.
Now look mean.

592
00:55:27,638 --> 00:55:29,640
Mean.

593
00:55:32,142 --> 00:55:35,146
Mother of Jesus.

594
00:55:35,146 --> 00:55:37,648
You don't have to worry.

595
00:55:37,649 --> 00:55:40,152
<i>I can take on two guys.</i>

596
00:55:40,152 --> 00:55:43,155
Yeah?  You punch one guy,
the other guy falls, huh?

597
00:55:43,155 --> 00:55:46,659
Somethin' like that.

598
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:49,162
You're slight in the butt.

599
00:55:49,663 --> 00:55:52,165
You better not go to prison.

600
00:55:58,673 --> 00:56:01,176
Hey, Nick!  Nick!

601
00:56:02,177 --> 00:56:04,679
Come here for a second.

602
00:56:07,183 --> 00:56:10,186
Hop in. I wanna talk
to you for a second.

603
00:56:10,186 --> 00:56:12,188
How ya doin'?

604
00:56:14,191 --> 00:56:17,694
Where you at these days?
What are you doin' for pocket money?

605
00:56:17,695 --> 00:56:22,200
- I just got a paper route.
- Is that right?

606
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,203
Your old man
is a righteous dude.

607
00:56:25,704 --> 00:56:28,207
Taught me everything I know.

608
00:56:28,207 --> 00:56:32,712
I could see it, man.
You got the bloodlines of a pro.

609
00:56:32,713 --> 00:56:36,717
<i>Now I'm lookin'
for a back pair of eyes.</i>

610
00:56:36,717 --> 00:56:40,221
Pay's good. No risk.

611
00:56:40,221 --> 00:56:42,723
I think you're the one.

612
00:56:45,728 --> 00:56:47,730
Why me?

613
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,733
'Cause I see somethin' in you.

614
00:56:52,235 --> 00:56:54,237
I got a feel for this.

615
00:56:54,738 --> 00:56:57,240
<i>I know your old man
just got outta the joint.</i>

616
00:56:57,741 --> 00:57:02,246
<i>But believe me, he had a lot of fun
doin' this. He was good at it too.</i>

617
00:57:02,246 --> 00:57:04,748
Think about it.

618
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:40,290
- What's in the T, Mary?
- Get your hands out of his pants, Derrick.

619
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:44,295
- Well, is he a he or a she?
- I'm a he.

620
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:48,299
- How old are you, nine?
- Shit, I'm 15.

621
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:51,303
You don't look but nine.

622
00:57:51,303 --> 00:57:54,306
I better not catch you
downtown. You're too cute.

623
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,312
Show us somethin'
you do on the farm, boy.

624
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:09,323
<i>Cop!</i>

625
00:58:24,842 --> 00:58:30,348
# Down in the street
makin' all that noise #

626
00:58:30,348 --> 00:58:35,853
# Don't want no whores on eighth avenue #
- Come on, it's your shot.

627
00:58:35,854 --> 00:58:40,860
# 'Cause tonight
I'm gonna be with you #

628
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:46,366
# 'Cause tonight
I'm gonna take that ride #

629
00:58:46,366 --> 00:58:50,871
- Did you win?
# Cross the river to the Jersey side #

630
00:58:50,872 --> 00:58:52,373
Feels like it.

631
00:58:52,373 --> 00:58:57,879
# And take my baby
to the carnival #

632
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:03,386
# And I'll take you
on all the rides #

633
00:59:03,386 --> 00:59:08,892
# Down the shore
everything's all right #

634
00:59:08,893 --> 00:59:14,398
# You with your baby
on a saturday night #

635
00:59:14,398 --> 00:59:19,904
# Don't you know
all my dreams come true #

636
00:59:19,905 --> 00:59:23,409
# When I'm walkin'
down the street #

637
00:59:23,409 --> 00:59:24,910
# With you... #

638
00:59:35,557 --> 00:59:38,059
You goin' home
to that old jailbird?

639
00:59:38,059 --> 00:59:40,561
His girlfriend's
probably still there, I bet.

640
00:59:40,562 --> 00:59:44,066
You can stay with me if you
promise not to rip my mom off.

641
00:59:44,066 --> 00:59:46,568
- I owe you a favor.
- You don't owe me a favor.

642
00:59:48,071 --> 00:59:51,574
Nobody better
rip Diane off.

643
00:59:58,082 --> 01:00:01,586
My dad, he remarried
a long time ago.

644
01:00:01,587 --> 01:00:06,592
I've never seen him since.
He lives in Tacoma.

645
01:00:06,592 --> 01:00:11,097
I know he's got new kids.
He has one my age.

646
01:00:11,097 --> 01:00:14,101
I wonder if she's like me.

647
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:25,113
Close your eyes. You can't kiss
me if you're mad doggin' me.

648
01:00:25,113 --> 01:00:29,118
- But I wanna see you.
- Why?

649
01:00:29,619 --> 01:00:31,621
'Cause I think you're
pretty to look at.

650
01:00:35,626 --> 01:00:38,629
Okay!

651
01:00:47,139 --> 01:00:51,143
<i>Oh, Molly!</i>

652
01:00:51,143 --> 01:00:54,147
<i>Who the hell am I,
the old woman in the shoe?</i>

653
01:00:55,649 --> 01:00:59,654
Oh, shit.

654
01:01:10,165 --> 01:01:14,670
<i> Somebody stole
my fucking dress!</i>

655
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:24,682
This time, Molly,
I am really gonna kill you.

656
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:28,687
<i>- You don't believe me?
-I do.</i>

657
01:01:42,703 --> 01:01:46,207
I thought you weren't hanging
out with her. She's not our type.

658
01:01:46,207 --> 01:01:49,210
- Do you like her?
- Yeah, I like her.

659
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:52,214
Okay, so you like her.

660
01:01:52,214 --> 01:01:55,584
Is she your first?

661
01:01:55,584 --> 01:01:59,088
<i>- What do you mean?
- Your first time out.</i>

662
01:01:59,089 --> 01:02:02,592
You mean my first time out?

663
01:02:02,592 --> 01:02:06,597
Probably. I would say
most probably.

664
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:12,103
Now I know what it's
like your first time.

665
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:15,107
They can break your heart. But you gotta
remember, you're a good-looking kid.

666
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:20,112
You got my looks.
You gotta learn to keep your heart.

667
01:02:20,113 --> 01:02:24,118
See? Let them lose theirs;
you keep yours.

668
01:02:24,118 --> 01:02:26,120
That's the trick
of bein' a heartbreaker.

669
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:30,124
Did you break
my mom's heart?

670
01:02:32,127 --> 01:02:34,629
Maybe I did.

671
01:02:40,136 --> 01:02:42,638
Why are you telling
me all of this?

672
01:02:45,642 --> 01:02:50,648
Because that's the way a father
and son should be together.

673
01:02:50,648 --> 01:02:54,151
I'm just tryin' to do for you
what nobody ever did for me.

674
01:02:54,152 --> 01:02:58,157
Don't put all your beans in one pot, Nick.
There'll be hundreds of dames.

675
01:02:58,157 --> 01:03:01,160
She's not a dame.

676
01:03:02,661 --> 01:03:04,664
That ain't her
first time around.

677
01:03:05,165 --> 01:03:07,667
What do you know about her?

678
01:03:12,173 --> 01:03:14,675
Hey, I'm just tryin'
to keep you straight!

679
01:03:14,675 --> 01:03:18,179
You keep me straight;
I keep you straight.

680
01:03:27,323 --> 01:03:30,327
- Give it here.
- Okay, you have to read it.

681
01:03:30,327 --> 01:03:33,830
Smells like me.

682
01:03:36,835 --> 01:03:40,338
- Return to sender. - Yes.
-Okay. - I got that in the mail.

683
01:03:42,341 --> 01:03:44,343
"Dear sweet Jack."

684
01:03:46,846 --> 01:03:51,351
"It's four in the morning.
the rain is pouring down.

685
01:03:51,351 --> 01:03:56,857
"I wanna kiss your big mouth...
your sweet mouth... your sweet mouth.

686
01:03:56,858 --> 01:04:00,862
"and lie down with you under
a big, big, big tree...

687
01:04:00,862 --> 01:04:04,366
"on wet the mossy ground.
on wet the mossy ground.

688
01:04:04,366 --> 01:04:09,372
Oh, God. and the droopy violets
brush against our nakedness."

689
01:04:09,372 --> 01:04:11,374
brush against...

690
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:14,377
- I can't read anymore of this.
- Oh, why not?

691
01:04:14,377 --> 01:04:18,882
My shorts are too tight.
And my kid's around.

692
01:04:20,885 --> 01:04:22,387
<i>What do you think of him?</i>

693
01:04:22,888 --> 01:04:25,390
<i>I can't tell if it's an
actor if he's a sad kid.</i>

694
01:04:25,891 --> 01:04:29,896
<i>Yeah, I know
what it's like to be 14 and sad.</i>

695
01:04:29,896 --> 01:04:32,899
<i>He never really
had a mother.</i>

696
01:05:34,971 --> 01:05:40,510
<i># Grab your coat
and get your hat #</i>

697
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:45,014
<i># Take your worries
to your doorstep # </i>

698
01:05:48,019 --> 01:05:51,639
<i># Just direct your feet #</i>

699
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:55,143
<i># To the sunny side
of the street #</i>

700
01:05:58,147 --> 01:06:03,153
<i># Don't you hear
the pitter-pat #</i>

701
01:06:03,153 --> 01:06:07,658
<i># And that happy
tune is yourself #</i>

702
01:06:27,681 --> 01:06:32,687
I sang that song to you a long time
ago when you visited me in Walla Walla.

703
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:45,702
You and me are
goin' north, Nick.

704
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:52,209
But...

705
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:55,213
- You said... - Yeah, I know.
I changed my mind.

706
01:06:56,714 --> 01:07:01,219
Hey, when it's 50 below in the
Klondike, a man needs a partner.

707
01:07:09,229 --> 01:07:12,233
<i>Hey, I finally got
a rise out of this kid.</i>

708
01:07:12,233 --> 01:07:15,736
Here, drink up if you
got hair on your ass.

709
01:07:15,736 --> 01:07:18,239
Gulp!

710
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,243
To Alaska.

711
01:07:21,243 --> 01:07:23,746
Hey, don't I rate a beer?

712
01:07:23,746 --> 01:07:27,750
<i>Oh, I guess.
Here you go.</i>

713
01:07:29,252 --> 01:07:33,257
<i>All right, come on.</i>

714
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:36,761
- Okay. - When are we
goin' to Alaska, Jack?

715
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:40,264
Well, not tomorrow.

716
01:07:46,021 --> 01:07:48,523
Remember that
picture of mom?

717
01:07:50,527 --> 01:07:52,529
<i>Yeah.</i>

718
01:07:54,531 --> 01:07:57,535
She was a model, right?

719
01:07:58,035 --> 01:07:59,536
Sort of.

720
01:08:06,044 --> 01:08:08,046
Did you ever know your mom?

721
01:08:08,046 --> 01:08:12,551
Yeah, for about three hours,
and I've never seen her since.

722
01:08:14,554 --> 01:08:16,557
How about your dad?

723
01:08:16,557 --> 01:08:21,061
What is this,
more for your book?

724
01:08:21,061 --> 01:08:23,564
My dad was an asshole.

725
01:08:24,566 --> 01:08:28,069
Weird, I wish I'd got
to know him anyway.

726
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:34,076
When I was born,
what did you like about me?

727
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:41,084
You know what
I liked about you?

728
01:08:41,084 --> 01:08:43,087
Nothin'.

729
01:08:50,095 --> 01:08:54,099
How you had a nice laugh
when I stole your nose.

730
01:08:55,602 --> 01:08:58,104
We didn't see too
much of each other.

731
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:03,610
You know what
I liked about you?

732
01:09:03,611 --> 01:09:06,113
You sang me songs.

733
01:10:02,812 --> 01:10:06,315
All right, real easy.
I'm gonna go in, get me two beads.

734
01:10:06,316 --> 01:10:09,320
Duck as low as you can on the floor.
I'll distract them. Just...

735
01:10:14,326 --> 01:10:16,328
"Lusty Lady"

736
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:19,832
We run from 11:00
until 3:00 a.m.

737
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:24,336
Yeah, well we...
Yeah, go on.

738
01:10:24,337 --> 01:10:27,341
We start with ruby at 11:00,
end up with raven at 12:30.

739
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:40,355
# Darlin' don't say a word
'cause I already heard #

740
01:10:40,356 --> 01:10:44,860
# What your body's
sayin' to mine #

741
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:51,367
# I'm tired of fast moves
I got a slow groove #

742
01:10:51,368 --> 01:10:54,372
# On my mind #

743
01:10:54,372 --> 01:10:58,877
# I want a man
with a slow hand #

744
01:10:58,877 --> 01:11:02,881
# I want a lover with
an easy touch # - Mom!

745
01:11:02,881 --> 01:11:08,387
# I want somebody who will
spend some time # - Get out!

746
01:11:08,388 --> 01:11:12,393
# Not come and go
in a heated rush #

747
01:11:12,893 --> 01:11:16,396
# I want somebody
who will understand #

748
01:11:16,397 --> 01:11:20,902
# When it comes to love
I want a slow hand #

749
01:11:25,908 --> 01:11:29,411
- Did you get my dress
back, Molly? - Mom!

750
01:11:29,412 --> 01:11:33,417
Can we leave Roy here,
and can I have some money, mom?

751
01:11:33,417 --> 01:11:36,920
Do I look like
I have my purse on me?

752
01:11:39,924 --> 01:11:41,926
You better get
my dress back.

753
01:11:41,926 --> 01:11:44,930
Son-of-a-fuckin'-bitch!
It ain't my fault.

754
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:49,935
- Was it that guy who isn't a guy,
Terry what's-his-name? - I'm not a snitch.

755
01:11:50,937 --> 01:11:53,439
You gonna run around all day
with your cutie pie,

756
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,443
or are you gonna take care
of Roy like you're supposed to?

757
01:11:56,443 --> 01:11:59,447
Hi.

758
01:11:59,447 --> 01:12:02,950
Bubble Gum, what're ya doin'?
They're minors.

759
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:05,453
This is totally
against house rules.

760
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:10,460
Fuck the rules. What about all this
nurturing attitude we're supposed to have?

761
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:15,465
I'm nurturing here. You're not staying
with me tonight unless you get my dress back.

762
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:18,969
<i>I am very upset
with you, Molly.</i>

763
01:12:18,969 --> 01:12:23,474
Nicole, can you get the kids
something to drink? Please.

764
01:12:27,979 --> 01:12:31,984
And I think there's
a popsicle left for Roy.

765
01:12:43,998 --> 01:12:48,002
<i>You've got about
another minute on your break.</i>

766
01:12:48,002 --> 01:12:51,506
You're gonna get me fired.

767
01:12:51,507 --> 01:12:54,510
<i>Well I ain't sittin' Roy either.</i>

768
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:57,514
<i>I'm tired of this shit.
I need money, mom.</i>

769
01:12:57,514 --> 01:13:02,018
I got five more hours
left on stage, Molly.

770
01:13:02,018 --> 01:13:04,021
How much money
do you need?

771
01:13:04,021 --> 01:13:06,523
Nothin'. I'll get it.

772
01:13:16,286 --> 01:13:18,788
I'd shoot the guys
who killed those animals.

773
01:13:18,788 --> 01:13:21,792
I'd look filthy
in one of them fur coats,

774
01:13:21,792 --> 01:13:26,296
- Driving a fast car like a "testaroni" or
somethin'. - Homeboy's gettin' the words.

775
01:13:26,297 --> 01:13:29,801
Aren't those wicked? Aren't those
the prettiest shoes you ever saw?

776
01:13:29,801 --> 01:13:33,304
I once showed up in a dress
downtown just for the fuck of it.

777
01:13:33,305 --> 01:13:37,310
- And nobody recognized me.
I looked good too. - Oh, yeah.

778
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:40,313
I want those shoes.
I want 'em bad.

779
01:13:40,313 --> 01:13:44,318
- You want the butt ugly ones?
- I know what's comin' next.

780
01:13:44,318 --> 01:13:46,820
Shut up, Freddie!

781
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:50,324
You wouldn't get those
for a working girl like me.

782
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:54,330
- Would you, homeboy?
- Come on, let's go.

783
01:14:04,457 --> 01:14:09,463
What, you really like this cleaning
business, Jack? See a future in it?

784
01:14:09,463 --> 01:14:13,968
Tell you what.
There's no end to dirt.

785
01:14:13,969 --> 01:14:16,471
Come on, listen to reason,
would you, Jack?

786
01:14:16,471 --> 01:14:20,476
Here's the reason. I been
walking sideways my whole life.

787
01:14:29,486 --> 01:14:31,488
What are you doin'?

788
01:14:33,992 --> 01:14:35,994
Remember the
good times, Jack?

789
01:14:43,002 --> 01:14:48,008
- What are you gonna do for real
money, Jack? - This is real money, Rainey.

790
01:14:48,008 --> 01:14:53,014
Everything I ever taught you
is bullshit. I'm sorry for it.

791
01:14:55,016 --> 01:14:59,020
Are you shittin' me, Jack?

792
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:02,024
You got somethin' planned.
I know it.

793
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:11,534
If I have to work neck deep in shit for
the rest of my life, it's better than jail.

794
01:15:11,534 --> 01:15:13,537
It's over, finished.

795
01:15:14,038 --> 01:15:17,041
I want you out of
my life, get it?

796
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:20,045
Stay away from me.

797
01:15:20,045 --> 01:15:24,049
Keep away from us.
Keep my name outta your mouth.

798
01:15:29,055 --> 01:15:31,557
If that's the way
you want it, Jack.

799
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:26,254
- What you got there, Nick?
- Nothin'.

800
01:16:33,262 --> 01:16:35,764
Give me those.
They're mine.

801
01:16:35,765 --> 01:16:37,768
What the hell?
You a fruiter?

802
01:16:38,268 --> 01:16:41,271
No, they're not mine.
They're for somebody else.

803
01:16:41,271 --> 01:16:44,275
- Where'd you get the money for these?
You steal 'em? - My aching ass.

804
01:16:44,275 --> 01:16:46,777
Yeah, you did too.
For her, right?

805
01:16:53,285 --> 01:16:55,287
You could put me back
in the joint for this.

806
01:16:55,287 --> 01:16:57,790
<i>I'll get rid of 'em.</i>

807
01:16:57,791 --> 01:16:59,793
No, I'll get rid of 'em.

808
01:17:04,799 --> 01:17:06,801
Fuck!

809
01:17:12,808 --> 01:17:15,310
What are you messing
with that weed for?

810
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:17,813
<i>Look at me when
I'm talking to you!</i>

811
01:17:17,814 --> 01:17:21,818
- Marijuana has medicinal purposes.
- Oh yeah?  How do you know?

812
01:17:21,818 --> 01:17:23,821
I read it in a book.

813
01:17:23,821 --> 01:17:27,825
That's the biggest bunch
of bullshit I ever heard.

814
01:17:27,825 --> 01:17:32,330
What else are you doin'?
Let me see your arms.

815
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:35,834
Get off my back. I stole them
'cause I'm saving my money for Alaska.

816
01:17:35,835 --> 01:17:37,837
Oh, I see.

817
01:17:37,837 --> 01:17:40,840
That's real smart.
You land in Juvie,

818
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:43,844
I'll go north myself,
back to plan A.

819
01:17:50,852 --> 01:17:53,354
Where'd you get this?

820
01:17:57,359 --> 01:17:59,361
I didn't steal it.

821
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:03,366
I earned it.
It's for our tickets.

822
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:13,878
First thing's first.

823
01:18:13,878 --> 01:18:18,884
We almost have enough to pay off
the landlady to keep her off my back.

824
01:18:21,387 --> 01:18:24,390
Another week,
we'll make it.

825
01:18:29,897 --> 01:18:32,399
Why won't she take half?

826
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:35,403
So she could give us
the bum's rush.

827
01:18:35,403 --> 01:18:38,906
Nut we ain't gonna
let that happen.

828
01:18:43,913 --> 01:18:47,918
- You wanna go for a bike ride?
- Sure.

829
01:18:48,418 --> 01:18:51,537
It's a good thing
you're such a shrimp.

830
01:18:51,538 --> 01:18:53,540
I don't know when
I'm ever gonna grow.

831
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,043
When I was your age,
I was small.

832
01:18:56,044 --> 01:19:00,048
- You were? - Yeah, then
I grew to how I am now.

833
01:19:00,048 --> 01:19:03,552
Fishermen up there, they're
dying for a 'New York steak'.

834
01:19:03,552 --> 01:19:07,056
Cruise around in one of these tubs
selling steaks and gas at inflated prices.

835
01:19:07,057 --> 01:19:11,561
Make a fortune. How's that
for a dream? Not bad, huh?

836
01:19:12,062 --> 01:19:13,564
Not bad.

837
01:19:17,068 --> 01:19:19,070
How much money
do we have now?

838
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:23,575
About $200. If we save
our pennies we'll make it.

839
01:20:15,618 --> 01:20:18,120
<i>Are you gonna come with
me when I leave town?</i>

840
01:20:18,121 --> 01:20:21,241
Will you come with me
to this party?

841
01:20:21,242 --> 01:20:24,245
If you come with me
when I leave town.

842
01:20:24,245 --> 01:20:27,249
- Whereabouts
you goin'? - "G-nome."

843
01:20:27,749 --> 01:20:31,754
- Where is that?
- G-nome, Alaska.

844
01:20:33,756 --> 01:20:37,259
I hear there's mass
money in Anchorage.

845
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,763
You wouldn't be
selling yourself.

846
01:20:39,763 --> 01:20:43,266
I'd find a straight job,
working construction.

847
01:20:43,267 --> 01:20:45,770
There's places up there
no man has ever set foot.

848
01:20:46,271 --> 01:20:48,773
Just wolves and bears.

849
01:20:49,774 --> 01:20:52,277
I don't know, maybe.

850
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:57,282
All right now,
put your arms like this.

851
01:20:57,283 --> 01:20:59,286
- Like this?
- No.

852
01:21:01,288 --> 01:21:02,789
All right.

853
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:08,296
All right, ready?
One, two, three.

854
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:11,300
And down, down, down.

855
01:21:44,972 --> 01:21:46,974
We got beat!

856
01:21:48,976 --> 01:21:52,480
You see anybody
walkin' out with my bike?

857
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,483
Our policy is to keep the doors
open during business hours.

858
01:21:55,483 --> 01:21:58,487
Mr. Kelson,
I want the full amount.

859
01:21:58,487 --> 01:22:02,892
Can you cut me a little
rhythm on that?

860
01:22:02,893 --> 01:22:06,396
I can't feed Lisa
on rhythm.

861
01:22:06,396 --> 01:22:09,900
I just got beat.

862
01:22:13,905 --> 01:22:18,410
Just a temporary setback.
It'll slide back my way.

863
01:22:20,412 --> 01:22:22,915
Mr. Kelson?

864
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:26,419
<i>I want you out of here.</i>

865
01:22:26,419 --> 01:22:29,423
I'll get you the money.

866
01:22:33,928 --> 01:22:36,932
You all right?

867
01:23:25,988 --> 01:23:29,492
Telephone.

868
01:23:30,493 --> 01:23:33,496
Hey, Nick?

869
01:23:33,496 --> 01:23:37,000
I'm in kind of
a situation here.

870
01:23:40,004 --> 01:23:43,008
Bring my pants.

871
01:23:43,008 --> 01:23:46,011
I'm on the corner of...

872
01:23:48,014 --> 01:23:51,017
Whistler and Madison.

873
01:24:07,536 --> 01:24:10,038
Jack?  Jack!

874
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:22,169
Evicted.

875
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:25,172
Well, that's it.

876
01:24:27,175 --> 01:24:29,177
Flat broke.

877
01:24:30,679 --> 01:24:33,683
Three days, we'll be
hugging the pavement.

878
01:24:33,683 --> 01:24:37,186
- It'll be okay.
- It's all fucked!

879
01:24:41,191 --> 01:24:46,197
You can't give up, Jack.
We'll get there.

880
01:24:46,197 --> 01:24:50,201
Yeah, after 8,000
more fuckin' windows.

881
01:24:50,201 --> 01:24:52,704
What are you talking about?

882
01:24:52,705 --> 01:24:57,209
My job, boy.

883
01:24:57,209 --> 01:24:59,712
Washin' windows.

884
01:25:01,214 --> 01:25:03,716
Washing windows?

885
01:25:03,717 --> 01:25:07,722
You said you had a job in construction.
You're a building supervisor.

886
01:25:07,722 --> 01:25:11,727
So, I lied.
Ain't the first time.

887
01:25:11,727 --> 01:25:16,732
All you've been doing is lying to me since the
day you left me back there in the bus station.

888
01:25:16,732 --> 01:25:20,236
Put your mouth in park, thief,
and get in your room.

889
01:25:20,236 --> 01:25:22,238
I don't have a room.

890
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:26,243
Well, then get out!
You're crampin' my style.

891
01:25:35,754 --> 01:25:38,257
<i>Where are you goin'?</i>

892
01:25:38,257 --> 01:25:40,759
Hey! I'm talkin' to you!

893
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:44,765
You're a fuck-up, and
you're gonna fuck me up too!

894
01:26:01,283 --> 01:26:05,288
Don't bother with that.
It only looks like your mother.

895
01:26:05,288 --> 01:26:08,791
She was no model. I'll tell
you what she was a whore.

896
01:26:08,792 --> 01:26:11,295
A five-dollar street whore!

897
01:27:14,868 --> 01:27:18,372
My parents are breathing
holy hellfire down my neck.

898
01:27:18,372 --> 01:27:21,876
Sure as shit they're gonna call
a cop or somethin' if they find you.

899
01:27:21,877 --> 01:27:24,379
<i>What you gonna do?</i>

900
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:27,883
I don't know.

901
01:27:28,383 --> 01:27:30,886
I can't go back there, Rollie.

902
01:27:30,887 --> 01:27:33,389
That's cold your old
man threw you out.

903
01:27:33,389 --> 01:27:36,393
You're a genius, Nick.
You don't deserve this.

904
01:27:36,393 --> 01:27:39,896
<i>Wake up before
my dad finds you.</i>

905
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,403
Brothers forever, man.

906
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:03,424
Aren't you gonna go out
there and look for him?

907
01:28:03,424 --> 01:28:05,426
He's 14. he's got
lessons to learn.

908
01:28:05,927 --> 01:28:08,931
Yeah, he's 14. Remember what it was
like to be 14 and out on the street?

909
01:28:08,931 --> 01:28:12,434
Yeah. he'll be scared, it'll be cold,
he'll be hungry, he'll come back.

910
01:28:12,434 --> 01:28:14,937
You didn't. You had to get
drug back by the authorities.

911
01:28:15,438 --> 01:28:17,440
- Just leave it alone.
- Is that what you want?

912
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,942
He'll come back when he's ready
to appreciate how good he's got it.

913
01:28:19,943 --> 01:28:22,947
Come back to where?

914
01:28:24,448 --> 01:28:27,952
He can't go back
to battery street.

915
01:28:27,953 --> 01:28:30,956
You could stay at my place.
Nick can too.

916
01:28:58,988 --> 01:29:01,992
- How's it going?
- All right.

917
01:29:01,992 --> 01:29:04,995
You have a place
to stay tonight?

918
01:29:06,998 --> 01:29:11,002
It's terrible. I know how it feels
not to have a roof over your head.

919
01:29:11,002 --> 01:29:15,007
Look, I have an extra bed.
You can stay there.

920
01:29:15,007 --> 01:29:17,509
I'd like to help out if I can.

921
01:29:33,028 --> 01:29:36,031
My name's Steve.

922
01:29:36,031 --> 01:29:38,533
What's yours?

923
01:29:38,533 --> 01:29:40,536
Harold.

924
01:29:50,547 --> 01:29:53,551
You're a nice-looking
kid, Harold.

925
01:29:55,053 --> 01:29:57,555
Did that make you
uncomfortable?

926
01:29:57,555 --> 01:29:59,558
Or did you like it?

927
01:30:21,083 --> 01:30:22,084
Hey!

928
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:30,093
I'm sorry. I thought
you were somebody else.

929
01:31:37,304 --> 01:31:40,307
- You seen Nick?
- Nick? Who's Nick?

930
01:31:40,307 --> 01:31:44,812
- My kid. Remember?
- Oh, yeah, Molly's cutie pie.

931
01:31:44,813 --> 01:31:47,315
He's on the streets,
too, now, huh?

932
01:31:47,816 --> 01:31:50,820
Kids. What are you gonna do?

933
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:53,322
- Wanna get a drink?
- No, I'm lookin' for Nick.

934
01:31:53,823 --> 01:31:57,327
Talk to Freddie. Everybody
down here knows Freddie.

935
01:31:59,329 --> 01:32:02,333
If you see Molly,
tell her to come home.

936
01:32:03,835 --> 01:32:07,455
# Do you wanna touch
do you wanna touch, yeah #

937
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:11,460
# Do you wanna
touch me there, where #

938
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:14,463
# Do you wanna touch
do you wanna touch, yeah #

939
01:32:16,466 --> 01:32:19,469
I could've had Barbie do it,
but I wanted you.

940
01:32:19,469 --> 01:32:22,973
And you're better-lookin' than Cathy.
I'll give you 20 more dollars than her.

941
01:32:37,490 --> 01:32:39,992
Come with me.
Get out of here. Get out of this place.

942
01:32:39,993 --> 01:32:42,997
I need to do this.
I need the money.

943
01:32:42,997 --> 01:32:47,501
I don't wanna go down there to G-nome
or whatever. I'm happy with my life here.

944
01:32:52,007 --> 01:32:55,511
# My, my, my
Whiskey & Rye #

945
01:32:55,511 --> 01:32:58,514
# Don't it make
you feel so fine #

946
01:32:58,514 --> 01:33:02,018
# Uh, uh, uh
gonna turn you on #

947
01:33:02,519 --> 01:33:06,022
# Can't you see we're
wastin' time, yeah #

948
01:33:06,023 --> 01:33:10,028
# Do you wanna touch
do you wanna touch, yeah #

949
01:33:10,028 --> 01:33:14,533
# do you wanna touch me there,
where do you wanna touch #

950
01:33:17,670 --> 01:33:21,675
There you go. Half a yard each,
since you decided to bring a friend.

951
01:33:23,176 --> 01:33:27,181
- Fifty bucks?
- Beats the minimum wage.

952
01:33:27,181 --> 01:33:31,301
That's okay. I didn't do
anything, right? I just stood there.

953
01:33:31,302 --> 01:33:35,307
That's what a lookoutmdoes, man.
There's more where that came from.

954
01:33:35,307 --> 01:33:38,193
Next time, come inside;
I'll cut you in.

955
01:33:38,193 --> 01:33:40,312
- I can't get caught.
- Me neither, man.

956
01:33:40,313 --> 01:33:44,200
Hey! It's a bird's nest
on the ground, man.

957
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:59,719
Hey!
Wait a minute, Nick!

958
01:33:59,969 --> 01:34:01,971
- Where you been?
- Been living.

959
01:34:01,971 --> 01:34:04,974
- What've you been doin'?
- That's none of your business.

960
01:34:04,974 --> 01:34:07,978
- Hey, I'm responsible for you!
- Bullshit!

961
01:34:07,978 --> 01:34:11,481
Hey!  I'm stayin' at Charlotte's!
I want you to stay there too.

962
01:34:11,481 --> 01:34:14,985
Hey, Jack! Don't do me
any favors, remember?

963
01:34:14,986 --> 01:34:18,489
- We have to pick ourselves back up.
- I'm going to Alaska.

964
01:34:18,489 --> 01:34:20,992
Where in the crap
have you been?

965
01:34:22,995 --> 01:34:25,498
- Where have you been?
- I told you, living!

966
01:34:25,498 --> 01:34:27,500
- Where?
- And when I die, I die!

967
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,502
You wanna live out in
the street, big tough guy?

968
01:34:29,502 --> 01:34:33,006
- Have you gone and seen me sleeping
on the streets? - Have you been hustlin'?

969
01:34:33,007 --> 01:34:36,510
- And eating on the streets?
- Have you been peddlin' your ass?

970
01:34:38,012 --> 01:34:41,266
You wa... wait
right there! Hey!

971
01:34:45,888 --> 01:34:48,891
That's right!
Just keep running!

972
01:34:51,395 --> 01:34:53,397
Just run away.

973
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,403
What are you lookin' at?

974
01:35:01,906 --> 01:35:04,409
- What the hell are you doing?
- Family problem, sir.

975
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:06,912
This isn't a crisis center.
It's a bank.

976
01:35:06,912 --> 01:35:08,914
It won't happen again.
I said I'm sorry.

977
01:35:08,914 --> 01:35:12,418
We could lose customers
with this kind of nonsense.

978
01:35:12,419 --> 01:35:16,423
- I said, I'm fucking sorry.
- What did you say to me?

979
01:35:16,423 --> 01:35:20,928
- I said, blow it out your ass.
- You're fired.

980
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:26,818
I do a good job here.
Hey, you can't take my job away.

981
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:41,335
Charlotte?

982
01:35:41,335 --> 01:35:45,340
I was afraid somethin' like this was
gonna happen. His mother was a mess.

983
01:35:45,841 --> 01:35:49,845
<i>He was comin' along, learnin' stuff.
He had a hell of a potential.</i>

984
01:35:49,845 --> 01:35:52,849
Tthat kid could've been anything.
What happened to him?

985
01:35:52,849 --> 01:35:55,852
- He isn't dead.
- No, not yet.

986
01:35:56,352 --> 01:35:58,355
Why do you think
he's out there?

987
01:35:58,355 --> 01:36:01,858
He started hanging out with that
chippie downstairs and those street punks.

988
01:36:01,859 --> 01:36:04,863
Next, he's coming home with a pair
of high heels. The rest is history.

989
01:36:04,863 --> 01:36:07,866
You don't think filling up
that boy's head with dreams,

990
01:36:08,366 --> 01:36:11,370
and then kicking him out on his
ass had anything to do with it?

991
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:13,872
Hey, when he came to me,
he didn't have any dreams!

992
01:36:13,873 --> 01:36:17,377
He had nothin'.
He had a picture of a pig.

993
01:36:17,377 --> 01:36:20,380
Don't pin that rap on me.
I'm out there bustin' my hump...

994
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:24,385
while this little wiseass punk
is out there thievin'.

995
01:36:24,385 --> 01:36:29,391
Gettin' mouthy. I take him in,
and he gets mouthy.

996
01:36:29,391 --> 01:36:31,893
You miss him.

997
01:36:34,396 --> 01:36:36,899
It's all falling apart on me.

998
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:41,404
I wasn't afraid in prison,
and now I'm, I'm really scared.

999
01:36:43,407 --> 01:36:46,410
I don't know
if I can help the kid.

1000
01:36:47,912 --> 01:36:50,415
I don't know if I have
anything good to give him.

1001
01:36:50,916 --> 01:36:53,418
He needs so much.

1002
01:36:57,924 --> 01:37:02,429
This is no good. I gotta turn this
around, get some money quick.

1003
01:37:02,429 --> 01:37:04,931
How are you gonna do that?

1004
01:37:04,932 --> 01:37:07,434
I got my ways.

1005
01:37:08,937 --> 01:37:12,440
Are we going back
to jailhouse correspondence?

1006
01:37:16,946 --> 01:37:19,949
I gotta split.

1007
01:37:19,949 --> 01:37:22,953
You should find somebody
better than me.

1008
01:37:25,455 --> 01:37:27,958
You're all right by me.

1009
01:37:37,469 --> 01:37:39,971
I want to be with you.

1010
01:38:02,865 --> 01:38:04,867
Shut the door.

1011
01:38:08,372 --> 01:38:10,374
It's a nice house.

1012
01:38:22,888 --> 01:38:25,390
Hey, what can we do with this?
Is it worth anything?

1013
01:38:25,391 --> 01:38:28,178
Beats me.
Take it.

1014
01:38:31,181 --> 01:38:33,684
God!

1015
01:38:58,078 --> 01:39:00,081
Stale.

1016
01:39:27,112 --> 01:39:29,614
- Your hair's getting kind of
long, you know that? - Yeah.

1017
01:39:29,615 --> 01:39:32,118
You'll have to get
a little cut here.

1018
01:39:34,621 --> 01:39:37,123
Did you just hear something?

1019
01:39:37,123 --> 01:39:40,127
- No.
- Hey, check this out.

1020
01:39:40,127 --> 01:39:43,130
Hey, goldfish don't
have teeth, do they?

1021
01:39:43,631 --> 01:39:46,635
Yeah they do, look.

1022
01:39:53,643 --> 01:39:56,145
What are you doing
in my room?

1023
01:39:56,145 --> 01:39:59,649
Freeze.
Close the door, boy.

1024
01:39:59,650 --> 01:40:02,653
- Rollie, put it away.
- I'm gonna get my dad!

1025
01:40:02,653 --> 01:40:05,156
Put it down, Rollie! Jesus!
- Look what you did, you big dummy!

1026
01:40:05,156 --> 01:40:08,659
- You're supposed to keep watch!
- You were! You're such a bonehead!

1027
01:40:09,661 --> 01:40:13,165
What the hell
is going on in here?

1028
01:40:32,071 --> 01:40:34,073
Rollie.

1029
01:40:39,079 --> 01:40:41,081
Oh, my God!

1030
01:41:19,875 --> 01:41:21,877
Nick!

1031
01:41:21,877 --> 01:41:23,880
It's me!

1032
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:27,383
Freddie told me you'd be here.
What's wrong?

1033
01:41:27,384 --> 01:41:30,888
Jack, I wanna come home.

1034
01:41:30,888 --> 01:41:33,390
Hey, what's all the tears?
What are you cryin' for?

1035
01:41:33,391 --> 01:41:35,894
Rollie's dead,
and it's my fault.

1036
01:41:35,894 --> 01:41:38,897
What happened?

1037
01:41:38,897 --> 01:41:41,399
Me and him, we broke
into this house.

1038
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,903
There was a gun,
and this man came in.

1039
01:41:43,903 --> 01:41:48,408
We were fighting, and the
gun went off and Rollie got shot.

1040
01:41:51,912 --> 01:41:54,414
He's dead.

1041
01:42:05,928 --> 01:42:07,931
All right.

1042
01:42:07,931 --> 01:42:12,936
- Listen. people like us, we make
a lot of mistakes. - I wish I was dead.

1043
01:42:12,936 --> 01:42:16,941
You can't roll over and die
every time somethin' goes south.

1044
01:42:16,941 --> 01:42:20,946
You gotta...
pick yourself up, get on with life.

1045
01:42:20,946 --> 01:42:24,950
There's nothin' you can do
to bring that boy back.

1046
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:27,954
Now listen to me.

1047
01:42:28,455 --> 01:42:30,957
We're goin' north, okay?

1048
01:42:30,957 --> 01:42:33,961
You keep me straight;
I keep you straight.

1049
01:42:37,965 --> 01:42:41,970
We'll feel clean up there.
we won't have to keep runnin'.

1050
01:42:43,472 --> 01:42:47,977
See, I never told you, but I
used to be a runner, just like you.

1051
01:42:49,979 --> 01:42:54,985
Now listen, was there anybody who saw you in
that house? Anybody that might rat on you?

1052
01:42:58,489 --> 01:43:00,992
- Rainey.
- Rainey?

1053
01:43:00,992 --> 01:43:03,995
Didn't I tell you to
stay away from Rainey?

1054
01:43:06,499 --> 01:43:08,501
All right.

1055
01:43:12,004 --> 01:43:15,508
Never mind that now.
Here.

1056
01:43:20,014 --> 01:43:24,018
Now, I want you to get the
tickets, and leave one for me.

1057
01:43:24,018 --> 01:43:27,522
Then get on that ferry and
wait for me. I'll meet you there.

1058
01:43:27,523 --> 01:43:30,526
- I think it leaves around 7:00 or 8:00.
- Where are you going?

1059
01:43:30,526 --> 01:43:33,029
- I got business to
take care of. - Don't leave.

1060
01:43:33,029 --> 01:43:36,532
- I'm not going anywhere. I just gotta
go somewhere. - Please don't go.

1061
01:43:36,533 --> 01:43:39,036
- Please.
- I'll meet you on the ferry.

1062
01:43:39,537 --> 01:43:42,540
Now, can you stay out of
trouble from now 'til then?

1063
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:45,042
Okay.

1064
01:43:50,549 --> 01:43:53,553
From here on in,
you're all I got.

1065
01:43:54,053 --> 01:43:57,056
Unfortunately
I'm all you got.

1066
01:44:29,210 --> 01:44:32,214
What's up, Jack? You scared me, man.
I thought you were the cops.

1067
01:44:32,214 --> 01:44:34,716
Where are you goin'?
What're you packin' for?

1068
01:44:34,717 --> 01:44:38,221
You fucker!
I kept your ass out of jail!

1069
01:44:44,729 --> 01:44:47,732
There are a million
punks on the street.

1070
01:44:47,732 --> 01:44:49,734
Why'd you pick on Nick?

1071
01:45:00,747 --> 01:45:04,752
What are you...
Gonna do, Jack, kill me?

1072
01:45:18,267 --> 01:45:22,271
I told you, you son-of-a-bitch.
Come here!

1073
01:45:22,271 --> 01:45:24,274
Get the fuck out of here!

1074
01:45:24,775 --> 01:45:28,278
You mother fucker!

1075
01:45:45,682 --> 01:45:48,685
I'm takin' my end, Rainey.

1076
01:46:41,997 --> 01:46:43,748
Look out!

1077
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:50,123
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

1078
01:46:53,626 --> 01:46:56,129
Give me my money!
Stop 'im!

1079
01:49:04,662 --> 01:49:07,164
What do you know, kid,
we made it.

1080
01:49:10,034 --> 01:49:13,038
<i>I've been lookin' all over
for you. Give me a hand.</i>

1081
01:49:13,538 --> 01:49:16,541
I don't feel so good.

1082
01:49:16,541 --> 01:49:19,044
What's the matter?

1083
01:49:19,045 --> 01:49:21,564
I never was much of a sailor.

1084
01:49:26,069 --> 01:49:30,073
- Should I get a doctor?
- No, no. stay here. Don't leave.

1085
01:49:30,073 --> 01:49:32,576
Stick by your dumb old dad.

1086
01:49:43,590 --> 01:49:47,594
People are gonna tell you
you're no good. Don't listen.

1087
01:49:49,596 --> 01:49:53,601
Whatever's happened, I wanna see
you make it up there, little man.

1088
01:49:55,703 --> 01:49:58,707
<i>Things could be different for you.</i>

1089
01:50:00,709 --> 01:50:03,713
<i>You won't have to keep runnin'.</i>

1090
01:50:05,214 --> 01:50:08,217
<i>I did the best I could.</i>

1091
01:50:08,217 --> 01:50:11,721
<i>I'm not gonna
let you off the hook.</i>

1092
01:50:38,753 --> 01:50:43,759
# Now ring the bell backwards
and bury the ax #

1093
01:50:43,759 --> 01:50:48,263
# Fall down on your knees
in the dirt #

1094
01:50:48,263 --> 01:50:52,268
# I'm tied to the mast
between water and wind #

1095
01:50:52,268 --> 01:50:56,773
# Believe me
you'll never get hurt #

1096
01:50:56,774 --> 01:51:01,278
# My ring's in the pawn shop
the rain's in the hull #

1097
01:51:01,278 --> 01:51:05,666
# Down at the five
points I stand #

1098
01:51:05,667 --> 01:51:12,291
# I'll lose everything but
I won't let go of your hand #

1099
01:51:15,295 --> 01:51:19,799
# Now Peter denied
and Judas betrayed #

1100
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:24,305
# I played with the roll
of your drum #

1101
01:51:24,305 --> 01:51:29,311
# And the wind will tell
the turn from the wheel #

1102
01:51:29,311 --> 01:51:33,315
# And the watchman's
making his rounds #

1103
01:51:33,315 --> 01:51:38,821
# Will you leave me hanging
by the skin of my teeth #

1104
01:51:38,822 --> 01:51:42,827
# I've only got
one leg to stand #

1105
01:51:42,827 --> 01:51:49,334
# You can send me to hell,
but I'll never let go of your hand #

1106
01:51:52,838 --> 01:51:57,343
# Swing from the rope
on a cross and a dream #

1107
01:51:57,343 --> 01:52:01,348
# Some would watch
you explode #

1108
01:52:01,849 --> 01:52:06,353
# From temple to union
to where they have been #

1109
01:52:06,353 --> 01:52:12,860
# Walkin' back
home in the mud #

1110
01:52:47,535 --> 01:52:53,041
# I must make my best
of the only way home #

1111
01:52:53,041 --> 01:52:56,544
# Mourning is only in stones #

1112
01:52:57,045 --> 01:53:02,051
# I'm lost on the midway
I'm reckless in your eyes #

1113
01:53:02,051 --> 01:53:06,556
# Just give me
a couple more throws #

1114
01:53:06,557 --> 01:53:11,562
# I'll dare you to dine
with a cross late at night #

1115
01:53:11,562 --> 01:53:15,567
# Dare me to jump and I will #

1116
01:53:15,567 --> 01:53:21,690
# I'll fall from your grace
but I'll never let go of your hand #

1117
01:53:22,053 --> 01:53:26,378
# I'll never let go
of your hand #
