00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:44,505
Not in the mood?

542
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:46,202
How can you look at a woman like
that and her friend

543
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:47,334
and say you're not in the mood?

544
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:48,596
I'm saying we're having a good
time.

545
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:49,945
You want to go over there, go
over there.

546
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:51,207
You want to hang out with me,
hang out with me.

547
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:53,732
Don't fuck with me, man. I'm not
in the moon.

548
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:56,082
Man, what is it with you and
this mood shit, Mickey?

549
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:59,476
I just-- I just want to go over
there and introduce myself,

550
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,088
and then we'll hang out, man.

551
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:03,872
Come on, please?

552
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:06,396
Come on, let's go.

553
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,442
Man, you think he's coming over
here?

554
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:09,356
Be cool.

555
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:10,270
Be cool.

556
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:16,842
What's up?

557
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:19,018
Hi.

558
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:20,497
How you doing?

559
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:21,368
I'm all right.

560
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:22,456
How you doing? - Yeah?

561
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:23,326
Good.

562
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,675
Yeah?

563
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:27,896
Yeah, I'm Lex and this is my
brother Mick.

564
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,768
I'm Debbie and this is my
girlfriend Lisa.

565
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:34,424
Mind if I sit with you?

566
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:35,338
Sure.

567
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:42,171
Want a beer?

568
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,869
No. I don't drink.

569
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:44,826
I'll have a beer.

570
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,740
Yeah?

571
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,788
So that makes you a man, huh?

572
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:56,142
See you later.

573
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:57,752
Nice meeting you, Miss Titties.

574
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,884
No, he didn't.

575
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:00,363
Punk.

576
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,975
Punk.

577
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:04,715
Yo, don't mind him.

578
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:05,716
That's my baby brother.

579
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,109
He's very sensitive.

580
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:08,415
How about you?

581
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:09,503
Me?

582
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:10,417
I'm cool.

583
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,287
You cool?

584
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:12,549
Yeah.

585
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:14,464
So you look fly.

586
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:17,554
You look like this all the time?

587
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:18,947
On a good day.

588
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:20,166
Well, it must be a good day.

589
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,080
Yeah?

590
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:21,950
Yeah.

591
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:23,647
And you too.

592
00:30:23,691 --> 00:30:24,648
You having fun in the park?

593
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:31,264
There was scouts there from the
NBA.

594
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:32,613
Be careful, you hear?

595
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:33,527
I fucked up.

596
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,963
What can I say?

597
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:36,486
Jesus, Lex, you've got to be
the roughest shooter

598
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,705
I have ever seen.

599
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:38,749
You don't have hands, for
Christ's sake.

600
00:30:38,793 --> 00:30:40,142
You got mitts.

601
00:30:40,186 --> 00:30:41,274
You all right?

602
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:43,537
Oh, yeah, run down the corner
store

603
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,060
and get me a carton of
Parliaments

604
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:47,976
and a fifth of Bombay and a bag
of ice, huh?

605
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,586
Yeah, right.

606
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:53,634
If I have to go through the
whole [INAUDIBLE],, I'd be dead.

607
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:55,070
I'll get them next time.

608
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:56,506
Lex, you're too old.

609
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,638
You have no college.

610
00:30:57,681 --> 00:30:59,335
You're not going to be a pro
player.

611
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:01,468
You and me, we're both going to
starve.

612
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:02,599
LEX: We're never going to
starve.

613
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:03,470
You know why?

614
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:04,775
Why?

615
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:06,952
Because if it don't work out
here this year,

616
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:08,867
next year, we're going to
Europe.

617
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,651
- Europe? - Yeah.

618
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:12,087
Remember that guy from Lisbon?

619
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:13,915
He still writes me.

620
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:16,570
You're gonna love it.

621
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:22,315
Lisbon, then, in the off season,
we travel, Madrid, Rome.

622
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:26,623
Europe.

623
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,451
How do you like the new
uniform, Ma?

624
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:30,714
I think you're gonna freeze
your ass off, Mickey.

625
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:31,977
What is it with you and the
cold.

626
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,152
I said I was moving to 1st
avenue,

627
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:34,283
you said I was going to freeze.

628
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:35,632
Well, it's colder down on 1st
Avenue.

629
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:36,938
You get closer to the river.

630
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:39,201
The point is, they got heat on
1st Avenue, Ma.

631
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:40,420
I don't know.

632
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:42,030
Those uniforms don't look so
warm to me,

633
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:44,032
big shot with your own
apartment.

634
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:45,468
You're thinking about the old
uniforms.

635
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:46,687
These are the new uniforms.

636
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,123
We got the down coat in the
wintertime.

637
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,733
You'll catch pneumonia, you'll
see.

638
00:31:49,777 --> 00:31:52,388
Ma, underneath the down coat,
we got the bulletproof vest.

639
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:53,259
Yeah?

640
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:54,521
Yeah.

641
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:55,783
The whole uniform is more form
fitting, Ma.

642
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:57,872
The whole uniform is more form
fitting, Ma.

643
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,004
He sounds like a bitch.

644
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,440
Shut up.

645
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:01,745
LEX: He's drinking beer. Did he
tell you that part?

646
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:03,617
- Yeah, somewhat? - Yeah.

647
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,010
First, you're going to be
drinking beer,

648
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:07,577
then it's a fifth of Bombay
every day just like her.

649
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:08,752
Ma doesn't drink anymore.

650
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:10,145
Yeah, you know why?

651
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:11,016
Diabetes, Mick.

652
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,104
Diabetes.

653
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,670
Will the two of you just cut it
out?

654
00:32:13,714 --> 00:32:15,063
What, you want him to wind up
like you?

655
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:23,028
Your brother just loves to hurt
my feelings.

656
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:27,902
You see what you did?

657
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,208
You did it.

658
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:30,557
I have a couple of beers every
once in a while.

659
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,732
Big fucking deal.

660
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:33,603
See, already, it's a couple of
beers

661
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:35,779
every once in a while with your
cop friends.

662
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,088
I'm not getting into this.

663
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:42,003
You brought it up.

664
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,918
So what happened with that
girl?

665
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,615
What happened?

666
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,009
We made it, she cooked, I ate,
she sucked.

667
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:50,838
It was so good, Mickey, somebody
should have taped it.

668
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:55,974
Your ability to desecrate in my
mother's house

669
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,236
is astounding.

670
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:15,994
I'm better than you are.

671
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,518
Say it.

672
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:19,432
Say it.

673
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:20,955
You're better than me, baby.

674
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:31,226
Oh.

675
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,185
[INAUDIBLE],, you score on me,
right,

676
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:34,795
now you got to be like that.

677
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:35,970
[INAUDIBLE]

678
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:47,286
Tell me a secret.

679
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:49,723
What kind of secret?

680
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:51,246
Something deep.

681
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,640
Something deep, huh?

682
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:55,946
Oh, I'm sorry.

683
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,123
Forget who I'm talking to here.

684
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,689
Now, wait a minute. Wait a
minute.

685
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:00,603
I'm deep.

686
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:04,042
Come on, I'm mad deep.

687
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,826
Well, tell me something mad
deep.

688
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:09,786
All right, according to legend,

689
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:14,835
right, my father used to beat my
mother's ass.

690
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:21,494
This guy tried to kill me
before.

691
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:23,061
Why'd he try to kill you?

692
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:26,977
Because I didn't want to see
him anymore.

693
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:29,067
Why didn't you want to see him
no more?

694
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,466
Because he kept getting locked
up and shit, you know?

695
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,904
And I ain't trying to live like
that anymore.

696
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:42,428
Because you're a good girl,
right?

697
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:44,169
Yeah, I'm good.

698
00:34:44,212 --> 00:34:45,605
I'm good.

699
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:47,346
I'm loyal.

700
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,956
And I'm smart.

701
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:51,132
You can cook.

702
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:52,133
You can fuck.

703
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:57,051
I've got a lot of good
qualities.

704
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:04,580
You know, I'm falling in love
with you, right?

705
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:08,062
Yeah.

706
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:12,022
Yeah?

707
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:14,199
Come on.

708
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:16,114
That's all you got to say?

709
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,115
Come on.

710
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,032
I'm falling in love with you
too.

711
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:42,575
Yeah.

712
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:47,014
11-2, huh?

713
00:35:47,057 --> 00:35:48,407
Yeah, baby.

714
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,712
Ain't beat me yet, huh?

715
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:50,626
Nothing.

716
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,540
Not once.

717
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:56,545
Go get it, baby.

718
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,330
You don't like Debbie, do you?

719
00:35:58,373 --> 00:35:59,679
I don't give a fuck about
Debbie.

720
00:35:59,722 --> 00:36:00,723
I got my own life.

721
00:36:00,767 --> 00:36:02,160
Yeah, but you're jealous,
right?

722
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:03,248
That's what you think.

723
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:04,553
It's going to make you more
secure.

724
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:05,728
See, now why can't you admit
you're jealous?

725
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:06,729
I admit I'm jealous of you.

726
00:36:06,773 --> 00:36:08,122
It's not true.

727
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,558
Why the fuck would I be jealous
of you and a girl?

728
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:10,603
That would make me an asshole.
I'm not an asshole.

729
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:12,170
I'm not jealous.

730
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,215
How come you never had a
girlfriend then?

731
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,826
I've had girls, you just don't
know them.

732
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,567
Yeah, nobody knows them.

733
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:20,221
I'm not getting into this.

734
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:23,093
Look at me.

735
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:24,443
Sex is a good thing, OK?

736
00:36:24,486 --> 00:36:25,879
It's good. - Whatever you say.

737
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:27,533
Yeah, man, we were never taught
that, right?

738
00:36:27,576 --> 00:36:29,535
We seen a lot of shit before we
should have, but that's over.

739
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:31,058
It's in the past, and you gotta
enjoy your life.

740
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:33,713
- You finished, Oprah? - No, I'm
not.

741
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:37,586
Look, you're a good looking guy,
all right?

742
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,718
I mean, you're my brother.

743
00:36:38,761 --> 00:36:40,850
We got the same blood.

744
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:43,940
Girls are going to like you,
guys are going you.

745
00:36:43,984 --> 00:36:45,290
It's OK.

746
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,421
What's OK?

747
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:47,422
I don't care if you're a fag,
Mick.

748
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:48,728
I just want to see you happy.

749
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,251
I'm not a fag. You don't have
to lie to me.

750
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:51,905
I'm not.

751
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:52,601
Look, Mick, it's going to kill
yo to keep this thing a secret.

752
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:53,080
Lex, I'm a virgin.

753
00:36:53,123 --> 00:36:53,994
What?

754
00:36:54,037 --> 00:36:55,561
I'm a virgin.

755
00:36:55,604 --> 00:36:57,040
Get the fuck out of here.

756
00:36:57,084 --> 00:37:00,218
This is why I never fucking
talk to you.

757
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:01,262
All right.

758
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:02,176
All right.

759
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,438
Fine.

760
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:05,005
You're not a fag.

761
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:06,267
You're a virgin.

762
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:08,791
Fine.

763
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:10,793
So, you don't hate Debbie?

764
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:11,794
No, I like Debbie.

765
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:13,100
Yeah?

766
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:17,191
Good, because she's gonna have
my baby, kid.

767
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,714
Come on, let's go eat pizza.

768
00:37:33,163 --> 00:37:34,948
So what she do? She trapped
you?

769
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:37,298
It was a mistake, Ma.

770
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:38,256
Whose mistake?

771
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:42,695
The condom broke, all right?

772
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:44,044
Whose condom was it, Lex?

773
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:45,350
Come on, Ma, you're being
ridiculous.

774
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:46,481
I'm being ridiculous, huh?

775
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:47,395
I'm being ridiculous.

776
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:48,309
Are you a woman?

777
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:49,484
Do you know what women do?

778
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:50,355
OK, I'm a woman.

779
00:37:50,398 --> 00:37:52,052
I know what they do.

780
00:37:52,095 --> 00:37:54,924
I want to know whose fucking
condom was it, Lex?

781
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:56,186
Hers.

782
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,145
So she trapped you.

783
00:37:58,188 --> 00:37:59,929
MICK: Ma, people make mistakes.

784
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:01,322
You're never going to go to
Europe now.

785
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:02,497
No, no, no.

786
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:04,325
Look, we'll all go, OK?

787
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:05,326
We'll all go.

788
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,632
No, you won't.

789
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:07,546
I'll be dead.

790
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:08,503
Ma, don't talk like that.

791
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:10,984
Come on.

792
00:38:11,027 --> 00:38:12,638
All right, so, what are you
going to do?

793
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:14,683
You're going going to support
this child making $7 an hour

794
00:38:14,727 --> 00:38:15,815
driving a school bus?

795
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:17,469
No.

796
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:19,427
I'm going to work full time and
I'm going to get some overtime.

797
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:20,863
You get time and a half for
that.

798
00:38:20,907 --> 00:38:23,170
I ain't taking care of it.

799
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:25,259
I'm not going to go through that
on top everything else.

800
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,350
I'm going to take care of it.

801
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:30,482
You don't know the first
fucking thing

802
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:31,483
about being a father, Lex.

803
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:32,701
I'll learn.

804
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:34,355
There's no schools, OK?

805
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,965
There's no god damn schools.

806
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:37,663
The only thing you know is
basketball.

807
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:39,621
Now, you fucked that thing up
too, for Christ's sakes.

808
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:40,535
MICK: Ma, come on.

809
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:41,536
Shut up, Mickey, all right?

810
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,322
Just stay out of it.

811
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:45,235
You know, what you are?

812
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:46,324
You're a sucker.

813
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:47,934
OK, you ever heard that word
before?

814
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:49,370
You know what it means?

815
00:38:49,414 --> 00:38:51,241
That's what you never brought
her around, OK?

816
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:52,678
That's why you never told me.

817
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:53,853
She trapped you, and you know
it,

818
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:55,898
and you're a fucking sucker.

819
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:59,511
Yeah, well, if being a sucker
means

820
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:03,384
I can't wait to get the fuck out
of here, that I'm a sucker, Ma.

821
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:05,255
Oh, yeah. Great.

822
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:06,953
You all bright and cheery now,
what, because you

823
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:08,389
can shoot some sperm?

824
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:10,826
Any fucking retard can do that.

825
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,871
You should know.

826
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:14,177
You try raising that baby.

827
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:16,789
At least, I won't be drunk.

828
00:39:16,832 --> 00:39:20,662
At least I won't be a fucking
drunk, whore, cheap trick,

829
00:39:20,706 --> 00:39:22,098
fucking bitch.

830
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,842
You get the fuck out of my
house.

831
00:39:26,886 --> 00:39:27,756
You hear me?

832
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,497
Out of my house.

833
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:30,716
You son of a bitch.

834
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:31,673
Get out.

835
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:43,946
You were supposed to watch out
for him.

836
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:04,706
God, Lex.

837
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,012
[INAUDIBLE].

838
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:06,882
Are you coming?

839
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:08,188
Yeah.

840
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:09,581
Don't come yet.

841
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:10,886
- Oh. - What?

842
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,235
Hold it. Hold it.

843
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:13,149
Don't move, all right.

844
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:14,281
I swear to God.

845
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:15,543
Hold it.

846
00:40:15,587 --> 00:40:16,631
Hold it.

847
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:17,893
OK, well, tell me when. God
damn.

848
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:18,677
Hold it. Hold it.

849
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:22,942
Don't move.

850
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:24,465
You're moving.

851
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:25,553
Hold it, wait.

852
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:26,467
Don't come.

853
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:27,512
Tell me when.

854
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:28,469
Now.

855
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:29,383
Now.

856
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:47,227
Hey, what's up?

857
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,620
We're going to go to the French
museum

858
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:51,579
today, see a little Mattias,
Rembrandt,

859
00:40:51,623 --> 00:40:53,799
and some other French guys.

860
00:40:53,842 --> 00:40:55,540
MICK: Where's Debbie, man?

861
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:57,324
LEX: She's working.

862
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:58,238
MICK: Look, Lex--

863
00:40:58,281 --> 00:40:59,718
LEX: No, look, Lex. Fuck, Mom.

864
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:00,806
I'm not talking about her.

865
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:02,024
MICK: I'm not even here for
that.

866
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:03,504
LEX: Yeah, I'm sure. MICK: Look,
see this?

867
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:05,071
I got this for your kid.

868
00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:07,769
I thought maybe you could use
one of these.

869
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:09,902
LEX: Thanks, man, that's very
nice.

870
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:11,425
MICK: So what do you want, a boy
or a girl?

871
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,905
LEX: I want a girl. MICK: Why a
girl?

872
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:13,819
LEX: I don't know.

873
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:15,385
I want a cute little girl.

874
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:16,648
MICK: You're going to make a
great dad.

875
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:17,692
I can see that, man.

876
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:18,954
LEX: Thanks.

877
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:20,129
MICK: So, listen, this thing
with Mommy, man.

LEX: Look, I told you, you
little fuck,

879
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,741
I don't want to talk about her.

880
00:41:22,784 --> 00:41:24,351
MICK: Look, I'm just saying, she
don't look good.

881
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:25,483
LEX: Wait a minute.

882

What do you mean she don't look
good?

MICK: I'm just saying you should
go see her, man.

884
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,355
She don't look good.

885
00:41:28,398 --> 00:41:29,443
LEX: Wait.

886
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,836
Have you been giving her the
insulin?

887
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,533
MICK: I try, man. She don't let
me do nothing.

LEX: What do you mean you try?

889
00:41:34,013 --> 00:41:35,275
MICK: I'm saying she fucking
screams and yells, man.

890
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:36,624
She don't let me me try and do
nothing.

LEX: What the fuck are you
telling me, man?

892

That for the past two days, she
hasn't had no insulin?

893

MICK: I'm saying I tried to call
you.

894
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:41,977
She tried to call you.

895
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:43,109
You don't pick up the phone.

896
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:46,025
LEX: Oh, motherfucker.

897
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:47,069
Wait here.

I don't understand why it's so

00:51:01,188 --> 00:51:02,711
Go to the car, right?

1078
00:51:02,755 --> 00:51:03,712
Go and use the AC.

1079
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:04,670
Take her with you.

1080
00:51:08,674 --> 00:51:10,110
Come on, man, sit down.

1081
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:12,025
Where you been, man?

1082
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:15,028
Working, you know, with the
family and shit.

1083
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,073
Yeah, I hear you, man.

1084
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:16,943
I hear you, pops.

1085
00:51:16,986 --> 00:51:18,075
Yo, check this out.

1086
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:20,642
This is 100% working man right
here.

1087
00:51:20,686 --> 00:51:22,122
Remember that.

1088
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:23,471
That's right.

1089
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:25,647
Remember that.

1090
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:28,868
Yo, Lex, see this hoochie over
here?

1091
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:30,826
She reminds me of you?

1092
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:31,784
Yeah?

1093
00:51:31,827 --> 00:51:33,133
Why is that?

1094
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:36,484
Because she's white and she's
down.

1095
00:51:36,528 --> 00:51:39,052
Down for what?

1096
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,140
Down for whatever.

1097
00:51:43,404 --> 00:51:44,449
Yeah, I'll say.

1098
00:51:44,492 --> 00:51:47,713
I'll say.

1099
00:51:47,756 --> 00:51:49,715
You're a freak, right, baby?

1100
00:51:49,758 --> 00:51:52,152
You're a freak.

1101
00:51:52,196 --> 00:51:54,067
Scared me.

1102
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,416
Psst, come here.

1103
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,939
You hungry, Poppo, you want
something to eat?

1104
00:51:56,983 --> 00:51:58,419
Yeah.

1105
00:51:58,463 --> 00:52:01,161
Let me get an order of mofongo
and some rice and beans

1106
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:04,773
and avocado salad and some sweet
plantains

1107
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:08,125
and a papaya [INAUDIBLE].

1108
00:52:08,168 --> 00:52:09,430
Is that all?

1109
00:52:09,474 --> 00:52:11,215
Oh, he's a growing boy. What
you want?

1110
00:52:11,258 --> 00:52:12,216
What's your poison, baby?

1111
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:13,913
Rum and Coke.

1112
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:15,044
You got that? I'm good.

1113
00:52:15,088 --> 00:52:16,133
I'm good.

1114
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:18,352
Just get out of here. Give it
up.

1115
00:52:18,396 --> 00:52:19,223
Give it up.

1116
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:20,267
Give it up, y'all.

1117
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:21,268
Give it up.

1118
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:23,183
Slow down, man.

1119
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:24,184
What you doing, wench?

1120
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:25,142
Lex don't do that.

1121
00:52:25,185 --> 00:52:26,447
He's a ball player.

1122
00:52:26,491 --> 00:52:28,232
Nigga's 40-years-old, he still
got hoop dreams.

1123
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,192
That's what I love about you,
baby,

1124
00:52:32,236 --> 00:52:34,847
because you're optimistical.

1125
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:35,848
Ball player.

1126
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:40,940
Go ahead, Poppy.

1127
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:10,012
You ever look at somebody and
know that this

1128
00:53:10,056 --> 00:53:13,233
is somebody you can love?

1129
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:15,801
I'm not talking about somebody
you could fuck, right?

1130
00:53:15,844 --> 00:53:18,630
I'm talking about somebody that
you could love.

1131
00:53:18,673 --> 00:53:21,546
I'm not looking for a fast fuck
or a fast buck.

1132
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:23,635
I'm not a schoolgirl trick.

1133
00:53:23,678 --> 00:53:25,593
I'm not anybody you ever met
before,

1134
00:53:25,637 --> 00:53:27,726
so find a way to talk to me
that's respectful

1135
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:29,293
and reality based.

1136
00:53:29,336 --> 00:53:32,731
God damn, baby.

1137
00:53:32,774 --> 00:53:34,602
All right.

1138
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:36,256
All right.

1139
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,562
This is my life.

1140
00:53:37,605 --> 00:53:43,394
I got a wife, and I got a child
who's very sick,

1141
00:53:43,437 --> 00:53:45,178
and I got no money.

1142
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,093
You got no money, talk to your
friend Lefty.

1143
00:53:47,136 --> 00:53:48,355
I don't want to hear it.

1144
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:53,839
No, what I'm saying is, see, my
mother, she

1145
00:53:53,882 --> 00:53:58,931
died two years ago tomorrow.

1146
00:53:58,974 --> 00:54:02,413
I can not begin to tell you this
shit that I've--

1147
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:04,023
Save it.

1148
00:54:04,066 --> 00:54:05,894
I got my own problems.

1149
00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:09,507
If you want a shrink, an
encounter group, a 12

1150
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:12,466
step program, I'm not the one.

1151
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,251
Besides I already know about
you?

1152
00:54:14,294 --> 00:54:15,164
Yeah?

1153
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:18,298
What do you know about me?

1154
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:20,996
You're sloppy with your drugs,
you order

1155
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,564
more food than you need, you're
good looking,

1156
00:54:23,608 --> 00:54:24,957
but you're not good.

1157
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,785
You want something from me, when
I give it to you,

1158
00:54:26,828 --> 00:54:28,221
you'll be sloppy with me.

1159
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,049
You was a sloppy, dirty kid.

1160
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:31,398
Your mother never cared.

1161
00:54:34,096 --> 00:54:35,054
Don't look so pitiful.

1162
00:54:35,097 --> 00:54:36,011
You ain't dead yet.

1163
00:54:42,366 --> 00:54:43,323
All right.

1164
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:49,373
I think we could kick it.

1165
00:55:06,651 --> 00:55:07,739
Who sent you?

1166
00:55:07,782 --> 00:55:10,437
Moses did.

1167
00:55:10,481 --> 00:55:11,438
Lefty, you hear this guy?

1168
00:55:11,482 --> 00:55:14,006
He said Moses sent him.

1169
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:16,138
It's Abraham, stupid.

1170
00:55:16,182 --> 00:55:17,096
Abraham stupid.

1171
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:21,753
So what you want, man?

1172
00:55:21,796 --> 00:55:24,103
You got any Tango and cash?

1173
00:55:24,146 --> 00:55:27,062
Look, we got New Jack City, we
gotta Lethal Weapon, all right?

1174
00:55:27,106 --> 00:55:29,326
You ain't got no Tango and
Cash?

1175
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:32,807
Nobody got Tango and Cash, all
right?

1176
00:55:32,851 --> 00:55:34,722
I want Tango and Cash, man.

1177
00:55:34,766 --> 00:55:36,768
Yo, somebody tell this
motherfucker

1178
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:38,378
that we ain't got go no Tango
and Cash

1179
00:55:38,422 --> 00:55:39,901
before I pimp slap his ass.

1180
00:55:39,945 --> 00:55:42,948
Nobody ain't got no Tango and
Cash.

1181
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:43,862
Thank you.

1182
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,042
New Jack City,

1183
00:55:50,085 --> 00:55:52,261
A-ha.

1184
00:55:52,305 --> 00:55:53,175
Come on.

1185
00:55:59,312 --> 00:56:00,444
Let's go. Let's go.

1186
00:56:00,487 --> 00:56:01,401
Let's go.

1187
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:04,448
Who's next?

1188
00:56:09,757 --> 00:56:12,020
Who sent you?

1189
00:56:12,064 --> 00:56:13,935
Lex, your brother's here.

1190
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:21,421
Who's winning?

1191
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:22,988
LEX: What?

1192
00:56:23,031 --> 00:56:26,034
I said who's winning, man?

1193
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:27,296
Who gives a fuck?

1194
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,821
I play better than all these
motherfuckers.

1195
00:56:29,864 --> 00:56:31,518
MICK: Yeah, you play real good
from the couch.

1196
00:56:31,562 --> 00:56:33,259
He's got your number, Pop.

1197
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:45,445
That guy coming at me on the
job, [INAUDIBLE] my brother.

1198
00:56:48,317 --> 00:56:51,146
What are you talking about?

1199
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:54,193
If you need money, you can come
to me.

1200
00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:57,457
You don't have to do that.

1201
00:56:57,501 --> 00:57:01,418
I don't know what you're
talking about.

1202
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:02,593
All right.

1203
00:57:02,636 --> 00:57:04,899
I'll make it real clear.

1204
00:57:04,943 --> 00:57:11,123
I got a guy, a cop, a guy I know
from the fucking academy,

1205
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:14,431
a good fucking friend of mine,
telling me my brother's

1206
00:57:14,474 --> 00:57:16,607
working in Lefty Louie's spot.

1207
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:19,523
And I'm telling you, they're
going to shut his ass down

1208
00:57:19,566 --> 00:57:23,091
and everybody is getting locked
up.

1209
00:57:23,135 --> 00:57:24,005
You get that?

1210
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:31,926
I don't know what you've been
fucking smoking, man.

1211
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:33,450
I drive a school bus.

1212
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,286
Maybe your kid looks like me.

1213
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,418
I think she does.

1214
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,898
She's got your eyes.

1215
00:57:46,941 --> 00:57:49,335
Hey, Lex, I think your kid
looks like me.

1216
00:57:49,378 --> 00:57:53,252
Do you have any idea where my
brother's been working?

1217
00:57:53,295 --> 00:57:56,168
He's driving a school bus now.

1218
00:57:56,211 --> 00:57:57,604
No.

1219
00:57:57,648 --> 00:57:58,736
No, no, no.

1220
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:00,085
If I smack you, I'd be lying
right?

1221
00:58:00,128 --> 00:58:00,912
- Hey. - Huh?

1222
00:58:00,955 --> 00:58:01,826
Huh?

1223
00:58:01,869 --> 00:58:03,001
Stay the fuck out of this.

1224
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:06,700
Stay the fuck out of this.

1225
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:09,573
Don't ever come in my house and
disrespect me

1226
00:58:09,616 --> 00:58:11,357
in front of my wife and my kid.

1227
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,271
Whatever you say.

1228
00:58:12,314 --> 00:58:13,577
Yeah.

1229
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:16,884
You may be a cop, but that don't
mean shit to me.

1230
00:58:16,928 --> 00:58:18,495
I'll take your gun and pistol
whipped,

1231
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:20,845
put you in your patrol car, make
you beg for directions home.

1232
00:58:20,888 --> 00:58:22,150
Lex.

1233
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:23,587
- Say I won't. - Whatever you
say.

1234
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:24,588
Say I won't.

1235
00:58:24,631 --> 00:58:26,328
Stay the fuck out of this.

1236
00:58:29,462 --> 00:58:32,291
You was born a punk, and you
still a punk.

1237
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:38,210
Lex, so now the baby's crying.

1238
00:59:26,954 --> 00:59:29,783
I hope you're happy.

1239
00:59:29,827 --> 00:59:31,568
Debbie threw me out.

1240
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:34,745
For what?

1241
00:59:34,788 --> 00:59:36,573
She doesn't want me in the
house with the kid.

1242
00:59:36,616 --> 00:59:39,706
You shouldn't be there.

1243
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,316
What, man, ah.

1244
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,234
Come on, I'm just trying out new
shit, you know?

1245
00:59:46,278 --> 00:59:48,236
It's just a temporary thing,
man.

1246
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:55,330
New experiences, new sensations,
you know what I'm saying?

1247
00:59:55,374 --> 00:59:56,244
No, I don't.

1248
01:00:03,948 --> 01:00:04,905
Man, what am I going to do?

1249
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:11,390
I ain't got no home.

1250
01:00:11,433 --> 01:00:12,609
I ain't got no family.

1251
01:00:16,656 --> 01:00:18,136
Why don't you stay for a while
until you

1252
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:21,269
restrain yourself out.

1253
01:00:21,313 --> 01:00:23,097
Straighten myself out?

1254
01:00:23,141 --> 01:00:25,186
Yeah, you're going to
straighten yourself out.

1255
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,406
You're gonna get a job at Uncle
Mac's.

1256
01:00:27,449 --> 01:00:29,147
You're gonna stay here for a
while.

1257
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:30,322
You're going to go back to
Debbie.

1258
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:38,025
We're gonna make like none of
this ever happened.

1259
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:38,983
All right?

1260
01:00:43,901 --> 01:00:44,815
Yeah.

1261
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:51,560
Yeah.

1262
01:00:51,604 --> 01:00:54,955
All right.

1263
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:56,261
Bear hug, shit, right?

1264
01:00:56,304 --> 01:00:57,131
You know what I'm saying?

1265
01:00:57,175 --> 01:00:58,393
Yeah.

1266
01:00:58,437 --> 01:00:59,873
They started throwing rocks and

1267
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:01,092

He bit his fucking ear off.

1275

Fuck that.

1276
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:13,670

You want a Spam burger.

1283
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,733
How do you want that Spam
burger?

1284
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:36,257
I like it the way you

1285
01:01:36,301 --> 01:01:37,737

1288
01:01:40,261 --> 01:01:42,089

1289
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:43,700
Yeah, I like Spam. I don't give

1290
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:44,744
That shit tastes good.

1291
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:45,397
What the fuck you worrying

1292
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,877

Yo, you ain't never had no

01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:54,406
What the fuck is that jelly

1299
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:55,624
Yo, don't worry about it.

1300
01:01:55,668 --> 01:01:57,235
You ain't got to eat it, then
all right,

1301
01:01:57,278 --> 01:01:58,889
because they ain't no freebies
up in this piece, all right?

1302
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:00,020
You know what I'm saying?

1303
01:02:00,064 --> 01:02:02,762
Coming up here and starting
shit.

1304
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:06,505
Oh, Stingy, who is your new
dishwasher?

1305
01:02:06,548 --> 01:02:08,376
That's my cousin, Lex. Sexy
Lex.

1306
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,030
What, you sucking on some shit

1307
01:02:10,074 --> 01:02:11,162
Listen, you all want to hang
out?

1308
01:02:11,205 --> 01:02:12,554
I get off at like 10:00, all

1309
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:13,817
We could do a little--

1310
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,906
Who cares what time you get
off?

1311
01:02:15,949 --> 01:02:17,168
Damn. Fuck it, then.

1312
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:18,299
You don't want to hang out?

1313
01:02:18,343 --> 01:02:20,824
You like-- you gluing my man and
shit.

1314
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:22,695
Interview with the Vampire, she

1315
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,871
I mean just look at you, getting
all nice.

1316
01:02:24,915 --> 01:02:25,785
Shit.

1317
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:27,656
That's fucked up.

1318
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,268
I'm saying, you want to do
something later or what?

1319
01:02:30,311 --> 01:02:31,573
A little party.

1320
01:02:31,617 --> 01:02:33,140
Come on, like a soiree or some
shit like that.

1321
01:02:42,106 --> 01:02:43,063
Damn.

1322
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,199
Nah, I'm all right.

1323
01:02:48,242 --> 01:02:50,462
Oh, you want some old
motherfucking transformer

1324
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:52,072
shit, some new shit, kid?

1325
01:02:52,116 --> 01:02:53,378
I want you to--

1326
01:02:53,421 --> 01:02:54,466
Hey, yo, mind your business.

1327
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:55,380
Chill.

1328
01:02:55,423 --> 01:02:56,337
And I'll take care of mine.

1329
01:02:56,381 --> 01:02:58,644
All right.

1330
01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:00,341
I'll handle my shit with my
motherfucking family,

1331
01:03:00,385 --> 01:03:01,560
all right, girl?

1332
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,557
Oh, shit.

1333
01:03:45,952 --> 01:03:48,433
Eh, oh, Lex?

1334
01:03:48,476 --> 01:03:50,696
Eh, oh, Lex Lover?

1335
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:51,610
LEX: Shut up.

1336
01:03:51,653 --> 01:03:53,481
I got to concentrate.

1337
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:56,789
Eh, don't come in here for
about four minutes, OK?

1338
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,008
Four minutes?

1339
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:00,053
Why you got to be so stingy with
your loving.

1340
01:04:00,097 --> 01:04:01,533
Don;t worry about it, baby.

1341
01:04:01,576 --> 01:04:04,231
It's going to be the best four
minutes of your life.

1342
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:09,323
I'm gonna do the blast off move,
the roller coaster style.

1343
01:04:09,367 --> 01:04:10,977
Oh, shit.

1344
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:11,935
Don't come in, family.

1345
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:30,344
Yo, you mind if I [INAUDIBLE]?

1346
01:04:33,434 --> 01:04:35,610
You [INAUDIBLE]?

1347
01:04:35,654 --> 01:04:38,526
No, I just--

1348
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:41,399
I just don't sniff, you know
what I'm saying?

1349
01:04:41,442 --> 01:04:43,096
I like to take a hit once in a
while.

1350
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:47,492
Go ahead.

1351
01:04:47,535 --> 01:04:48,406
Go.

1352
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:49,450
Get you some water from inside.

1353
01:04:54,064 --> 01:04:55,804
Yo, Stingy, I'm coming in.

1354
01:04:59,504 --> 01:05:00,418
Oh, shit.

1355
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:06,467
Oh, shit.

1356
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:08,905
Man, you got no skills at all.

1357
01:05:08,948 --> 01:05:11,429
Hey, yo, man, what the fuck is
going on?

1358
01:05:11,472 --> 01:05:13,561
What the fuck is this, a family
affair?

1359
01:05:13,605 --> 01:05:15,128
Yeah, I saw your technique too.

1360
01:05:15,172 --> 01:05:16,477
It's definitely [INAUDIBLE]. -
Get the fuck out of here.

1361
01:05:16,521 --> 01:05:17,696
Get the fuck of here.

1362
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:18,305
I just got to get something,
all right?

1363
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:19,263
Relax.

1364
01:05:23,267 --> 01:05:26,052
It's happening, baby.

1365
01:05:26,096 --> 01:05:27,314
Oh, shit.

1366
01:05:31,057 --> 01:05:31,971
Fuck.

1367
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,411
Fuck.

1368
01:05:37,455 --> 01:05:39,065
Oh, shit.

1369
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:39,979
You came?

1370
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:40,980
Uh-huh.

1371
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:41,981
Me too.

1372
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:00,217
You don't love me,
motherfucker.

1373
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,175
You don't love me.

1374
01:06:02,219 --> 01:06:03,568
You don't love me.

1375
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:04,961
You don't love me.

1376
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:06,788
No, you don't love me more than
I don't love you.

1377
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:08,181
That's such bullshit, Lex.

1378
01:06:08,225 --> 01:06:09,052
Yeah?

1379
01:06:09,095 --> 01:06:10,575
Well, how's that?

1380
01:06:10,618 --> 01:06:11,750
Because if you love me, you
would

1381
01:06:11,793 --> 01:06:14,013
have saved me that last hit.

1382
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:18,452
If you love me.

1383
01:06:18,496 --> 01:06:22,500
If you love me, you wouldn't
have even been thinking

1384
01:06:22,543 --> 01:06:24,632
about the last hit because you
would have said, nah,

1385
01:06:24,676 --> 01:06:26,199
I want my man to have it.

1386
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:30,551
That's that romantic shit.

1387
01:06:30,595 --> 01:06:32,553
This is the real world.

1388
01:06:32,597 --> 01:06:33,815
Welcome, OK.

1389
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:35,730
Yeah, well, welcome to you.

1390
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:40,126
Lex, we got no more to get
high.

1391
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:41,084
What are we gonna do?

1392
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:55,011
What's up, man?

1393
01:06:55,054 --> 01:06:56,664
Yo, what's up?

1394
01:06:56,708 --> 01:07:00,712
Listen, like two or three weeks
ago, right, Lefty, he told me--

1395
01:07:00,755 --> 01:07:02,105
well, he didn't pay me, right.

1396
01:07:02,148 --> 01:07:04,542
So he told me like a week ago
that if he didn't

1397
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:06,892
get the money to me, that I
should

1398
01:07:06,935 --> 01:07:09,460
come by and pick up a bundle.

1399
01:07:09,503 --> 01:07:10,722
He don't usually do that.

1400
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:12,506
You know anything about a
bundle?

1401
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:14,030
No, I don't know shit about no
bundle, man.

1402
01:07:14,073 --> 01:07:17,163
Yo, Blaze, man, [INAUDIBLE].

1403
01:07:17,207 --> 01:07:18,338
- You're lying. - What's up,
man.

1404
01:07:18,382 --> 01:07:19,774
I ain't lying. - You're lying.

1405
01:07:19,818 --> 01:07:20,906
Yo, man, chill the fuck out.

1406
01:07:20,949 --> 01:07:21,907
Chill the fuck out, all right?

1407
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:22,951
Listen, listen, listen.

1408
01:07:22,995 --> 01:07:23,909
Yo, yo, ho, ho.

1409
01:07:23,952 --> 01:07:24,779
Everyone shut the fuck up.

1410
01:07:24,823 --> 01:07:25,867
Fuck that.

1411
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:26,999
- Shut the fuck up. - You're
lying.

1412
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,131
Lex, Lex.

1413
01:07:28,174 --> 01:07:30,481
Shut the fuck up, B. Do not
move.

1414
01:07:30,524 --> 01:07:32,091
He will blast you.

1415
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:35,790
Yo, Blaze, raise the fuck up, B.
Listen, you know how Lex be.

1416
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:38,010
Come on. He's just running with
the lip.

1417
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,968
You know Lefty be doing shit
like this.

1418
01:07:40,012 --> 01:07:41,709
He be doing shit and don't tell
us, man.

1419
01:07:41,753 --> 01:07:42,754
He don't tell us.

1420
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:43,755
It ain't nothing big.

1421
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:44,886
We can settle this shit later.

1422
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:46,279
Nobody need no body right now.

1423
01:07:46,323 --> 01:07:47,411
All right.

1424
01:07:47,454 --> 01:07:48,934
Nobody need no fucking body in
here, B.

1425
01:07:48,977 --> 01:07:50,196
It's all you.

1426
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:51,763
Get the fucking bundle, B. Get

1427
01:07:51,806 --> 01:07:53,112
If it's any problem, settle it
later.

1428
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:54,070
Get the bundle.

1429

Come on, man, keep it moving.

1432
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:05,603
Yo, man. Yo, motherfucker.

I still say he lying.

1436
01:08:24,752 --> 01:08:26,450
What if he comes home?

1437
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:27,668
Your idea.

1438
01:08:27,712 --> 01:08:28,930
Yeah, but I'm saying, his

1439
01:08:28,974 --> 01:08:30,802
- Call him. - But, Missy, wait.

1440
01:08:30,845 --> 01:08:31,716
Call him.

1441
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:15,123
I told Lex I had a cop friend
from the academy who

1442
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:17,125
said he was working for Lefty.

1443

I don't know, man, Lex came in
talking

1444
01:10:18,692 --> 01:10:20,520
about Lefty owe him a bundle.

1445
01:10:20,564 --> 01:10:21,652
Blaze was going to shoot him.

1446
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:24,263
I had to save his ass, and now
I'm hot.

1447
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:25,830
I'm sorry.

1448
01:10:25,873 --> 01:10:28,093
Yo, you sure you didn't tell
Lex I was undercover cop?

Believe in fucking married
women?

1450
01:10:36,667 --> 01:10:38,277
As far as I'm concerned, a
married girl

1451
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:40,584
can been naked in my bed, I
wouldn't touch her.

1452
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:41,976
I thought that about you.

1453
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:58,166
So this guy is boning this
married chick, right?

1454
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:01,561
And the husband comes home, so
he's hiding in the closet,

1455
01:11:01,605 --> 01:11:02,475
right?

1456
01:11:02,519 --> 01:11:03,911
Yeah.

1457
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:06,914
And the husband sees these big
balls hanging down.

1458
01:11:06,958 --> 01:11:08,394
It's a joke, right?

1459
01:11:08,438 --> 01:11:10,875
No, it's a true story, man,
word to my mother.

1460
01:11:10,918 --> 01:11:12,224
So he sees the balls, and he
says,

1461
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,660
honey, what are these balls?

1462
01:11:13,704 --> 01:11:16,141
She's like, no, they're
Christmas bells.

1463
01:11:16,184 --> 01:11:17,185
It is a joke.

1464
01:11:17,229 --> 01:11:18,883
It is not a joke.

1465
01:11:18,926 --> 01:11:19,797
Listen, listen.

1466
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,754

1467
01:11:35,552 --> 01:11:37,641
Right, so check it out.

1468
01:11:37,684 --> 01:11:40,208
The husband smacks the balls,
right?

1469
01:11:40,252 --> 01:11:42,341
He's like, hey, these bells
don't work.

1470
01:11:42,385 --> 01:11:45,518
His wife is like, no, you gotta
hit them harder.

1471
01:11:45,562 --> 01:11:48,434
So out of nowhere he just
punches the balls, bam.

1472
01:11:48,478 --> 01:11:50,349
And he's like, they're still not
ringing.

1473
01:11:50,393 --> 01:11:53,221
His wife's like, no, you have to
hit them harder.

1474
01:11:53,265 --> 01:11:55,528
So he grabs a mallet out of
nowhere,

1475
01:11:55,572 --> 01:11:57,400
just bam with the mallet.

1476
01:11:57,443 --> 01:12:01,839
He smacks the balls, the guy
falls out the closet like this.

1477
01:12:01,882 --> 01:12:03,884
Ding dong, motherfucker.

1478
01:12:03,928 --> 01:12:05,321

my thrill, right?

Oh.

Boom, so I pull the kid on top
of me, right?

Gots to, man.

to myself

there must be a god up there and
must

bag of my product

I wanted to, Lex.

01:19:51,177 --> 01:19:54,528
Now, I know you got certain
assumptions about my lifestyle,

1650
01:19:54,572 --> 01:19:57,923
like a lot of people are jealous
of my thing, you know?

Lex, you're a drug addict.

All right, now that's
assumption number two, right?

Because, see, that's where
you're wrong, all right?

See, my whole life, my whole
life, right,

1658
01:20:17,334 --> 01:20:21,729
has been dedicated to the
pursuit of not doing drugs,

1659
01:20:21,773 --> 01:20:25,777
and just because I may have had
certainly indiscretions,

1660
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:29,433
doesn't automatically qualify me
in that category,

1661
01:20:29,476 --> 01:20:31,827
spiritually and otherwise,
because--

1662
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:33,567
What do you want, Lex?

1663
01:20:33,611 --> 01:20:34,873

to do with my brother.

As a matter of fact, it has to
do with my father,

wants me to work with him
