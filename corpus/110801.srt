Might've got a lcok at theirfaces or anything?

374
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,770
lt was a blur.

376
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:28,005
l think l was the only person at the scene.

377
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,047
Never caught the guys?

378
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:34,981

383
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,861

And it's gonna take a minute.

447
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:11,657
[roaring]

448
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,823

454
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:55,899
l hope not.

455
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,837
l remained a virgin in prison.

456
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,703
[chuckles]

457
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,109
So you two clowns are vampires, huh?

458
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,343
Aotually, no. l'm the only real vampire here.

459
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,646
Ray is like

460
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,312
ghetto fabulous version of Renfield or some shit.

461
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,253
Ever read Dracula?

462
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:21,329
So he should be pretty easy to kill.

463
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,660
Run that by me again. ''Pretty...''

464
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,633
You heard me.

465
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,430
He should be easy to kill.

466
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,334
You got all types of weaknesses.

467
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,133
Crosses.

468
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,402
Wooden stakes.

469
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:36,138
Silver bullets. Holy water.

470
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:39,044
See this nigga beern gettin' his read-on in prison, huh?

471
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,686
Daylight. Can't go to somebody's house unless you're
invited.

472
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,685
Matter of faot, how'd you get this place?

473
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,653
Bought it... with the money we got at that last job.

474
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,087
Rememberthat last job?

475
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,821
[laughs] You betteer watch who you're kickin'.

476
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:55,124
l'm about to fuck you up. This ain't seven years ago.

477
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,631
This is my spot.

478
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,563
What the fuck do you want from me?

479
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,033
Need you to crack another safe.

480
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,298
What for?.

481
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,500
lt's not like you need any more money.

482
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:09,943
You gonna go buy a truckload of sunblock and chill at
the beach?

483
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:11,138
Ha, ha. Thats funny.

484
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,274
No, l need an amulet

485
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:17,513
that will lift this fucking curse off of me.

486
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,714
l don't want to be a vampire no more.

487
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:20,881
And there's this amulet

488
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:24,688
and it's in a highly guarded safe

489
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,124
with a timer on it.

490
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,095
Kinda like that last job we did.

491
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:30,859
Yeah. We all know how that tumed out.

492
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,764
When l get the amulet-

493
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,734
l don't give a fuck about you. Whats in it for me?

494
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,602
A whole lot of paper.

495
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,871
So you mean to tell me that you're gonna pay me for
a job

496
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,811
with money that you already owe me

497
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:48,042
forthe last fuckin' job we did together!

498
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:50,620
Exaotly.

499
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,380
Think about it, Jakeem.

500
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,855
l'm offering you a lot... of dough.

501
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,426
Who knows?

502
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:01,497
You could be set forthe rest of yourfuckin' life.

503
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:02,825
Can't get a job.

504
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,027
Joint, jail, job. No.

505
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,467
Who knows?

506
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:11,336
Maybe you can even buy that little cripple bitch some
rims

507
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,169
- for her wheelchair
- [chuckles]

508
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,709
forfuckin' her whole life up.

509
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,472
What if l don't do it?.

510
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:21,140
lf you don't do it... hmm.

511
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,345
l will rip out your heart and...

512
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,616
feed it to Ray.

513
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:28,520
Like that, Ray, right?.

514
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,027
Nigga lover heart.

515
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,686
Always tellin' me, ''Give me some heart, man.''

516
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:35,196
l'm not stupid.

517
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:39,097
Either way you're gonna screw me overr.

518
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:43,672
So you might as well suck me dry now.

519
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:45,501
Ungh!

520
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,438
Oooh!

521
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,712
You know what, Jakeem?

522
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:52,814
Think about it.

523
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,144
No need to make rash decisions now.

524
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,619
Contemplate.

525
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,654
Holler at me tomorrow.

526
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,450

527
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,070

How you doin'?

529
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:22,070
All right.

530
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,611
Where you headed to?

531
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,214
Oh, the grocery store.

532
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:29,717
Gotta pick up some milk and eggs and stuff.

533
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,787
And Twinkies and doughnuts.

534
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,047
Yeah, yeah.

535
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,592
One bag of Fritos. Thats it.

536
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,992
You can cook?.

537
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:40,995
Um...

538
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,393
Nah, forget it.

539
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,000
[chuckles]

540
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:47,535
Don't you wish you had someone to do that for you?

541
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,832
No.

542
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,442
l don't need anybody's help.

543
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,709
You don't wish you were rich?

544
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,510
Some money would help, l guess.

545
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,312
Pay some medical bills. You know. Stuff like that.

546
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:06,115
What would you do if you won the lottery?.

547
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:10,592
l guess l would...

548
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:14,288
Well, definitely pay off my medical bills, you know.

549
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:15,625
Umm...

550
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,200
Pay the rent.

551
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:22,396
Taking a vacation sounds nice tco.

552
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,201
Why are you asking me this?

553
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,069
l don't know.

554
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,274
You know, thats a common question.

555
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,176
'What would you do if you won the lottery?.'

556
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,543
Yeah.

557
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,786
l don't have a million dollars, you know.

558
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,788
lt's not a big issue for me now.

559
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,456
l'm sorry.

560
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,864
What is that?.

561
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,598
So you can buy a lottery ticket.

562
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,074
Lcok, l don't need your pity.

563
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,010
- l wasn't-
- Really. l don't need your help.

564
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,918
Whats up, Jakeem?

565
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,616
Why you lcokin' like that, man?

566
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:19,228
Every time you come around here, you're lcokin'
depressed.

567
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,763
That Matchbox bitch ain't giving you no pussy?.

568
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,232
[coughs]

569
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,301
Why you keep playin', man? [coughs]

570
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,938
Are you in or out?.

571
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:32,405
[coughs] Come on, lets go.

572
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:37,339
Come on, man.

573
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,470
Fuck.

574
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,977
Ahh! Lcok, man. Bull's-eye.

575
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,746
l didn't come here forthis.

576
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:49,256
Okay, boss, this is a job that we gotta do in the day

577
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,122
'cause they're not gonna expect us.

578
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,489
Especially two humans,

579
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,154
'cause they're usually guarding against vampires.

580
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,629
One and a half humans.

581
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,994
Okay, you got jokes.

582
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:59,466
This is a diagram of how it's gonna get down.

583
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,537
This is the front gate.

584
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,400
This is where the first guard is.

585
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,666
Afterthe first guard, there's gonna be two more.

586
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,277
How we get past the first guard?

587
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,434
Let me finish.

588
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,206
Once we get past these two guards here,

589
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:11,676
we head to this little room.

590
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,010
Thats where the safe is.

591
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,141
There might be one guard there. l don't know.

592
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,583
After we get pa-

593
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,416
When we get to the timer, we have about 60 seconds.

594
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:24,117
Afterthem 60 seconds, if we take tco long,
it'll alert more, so you have to be quick.

595
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,990
How do we get past the first guard?

596
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,061
Tear gas.

597
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,160
Sounds like a fuckin' dheathtrap.

598
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,735
Thats what it is, man.

599
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:37,067
lf we use tear gas, the whole rest of the block

600
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,869
is gonna swarm down on us.

601
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,643
Neverthought of that one.

602
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:48,280
How are you so sure that there's three to four pecple
inside?

603
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,909
- Possibly.
- How do you know this?

604
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,952
This is what l scoped out three weeks ago.

605
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,919
After we get past the first guard,

606
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:57,026
you don't think the rest will just rush to the froht?.

607
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,389
l didn't think of that one right there.

608
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,861
Escape route?

609
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:03,529
The front dcor.

610
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:04,928
So there's no escape route.

611
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,196
Not that l know of. No.

612
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,896
[exhales]

613
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:18,477
l think you need to leave the plannin' to me and...

614
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:21,378
-just let me be the boss.
- Okay.

615
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,883
'Cause you don't know what the fuck you're doin'.

616
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:25,919
Tend to your business, boss.

617
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,021
[sighs]

618
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,250
First rule...

619
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:33,886
is if we walk there and the shit dcesn't lcok right,

620
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:34,928
we leave immediately.

621
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:37,498
Okay.
[clears throat]

622
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:40,000
Second rule is no guns.

623
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,638
What the fuck you mean, ''no guns''?

624
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:45,572
How we supposed to get past fourto five guards with
no guns?

625
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,572
Smile at 'em?

626
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,210
No guns.

627
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,676
All right.

628
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:51,212
Just makin' this shit harder, though.

629
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,374
l get there and see you with a gun, l'm walkin' away.

630
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:58,079
Okay, boss.
[clears throat]

631
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,950
All right, listen.

632
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:16,602
[Ray] Yeah, he by hisself. This should be very easy.

633
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,273
So, we ready to do this?

634
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:24,741
He by hisselftco.

635
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,440
lt's easy like that.

636
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,076
lt's simple.

637
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:33,883
We distraot him and then hit him in the head with the
club.

638
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,683
Okay, that works.

639
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,259
So you ready to do this?

640
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,497
Whats wrong with you, man? You all right?.

00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:45,966

643
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,272
l don't need no weapon.

644
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,738
Yeah. l was serious when l said no guns.

645

829
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:47,301

You don't even deserve me to bust your ass.

838
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,916

You didn't mean nothing about that crackhead shit,

Ah, nah, man. You know you're still my number one

Jeez. Whats the situation?

864
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,706
They killed four of our men and they have the amulet.

865
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:15,317
Four?. ls that Baker back there with his face hangin'

Whoeverthe dumb bastard is

didn't tum it overrto his master 'cause he's still movin'.

869
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:28,253
The beacon on the amulet is still workng,
so we can track him.

870
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,591
What else we got?.

871
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:32,759
The security camera picked up a photo of these two
clowns.

872
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:34,665
Not the brightest motherfuckers in the world.

873
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:37,339
Beautiful. We got l.D.s yet?.

874
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,839

00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,739
- [electric humming]
- Hold on.

876

He's movin'.

877
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:45,641
We can catch him and beat it out of him.

878
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,214
He's at Main St. now.

879
00:54:47,384 --> 00:54:50,182
lf we mover now, we can get him in about a half hour.

880
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,581
Yes, lets go.

881
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:52,415
Gentlemen, pay attention!

882
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,850
Here's the situation.

883
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:57,153
We got four men dead. You don't want to be the fifth
one.

884
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,694
Watch your backs and your necks. No mistakes
today.

885
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,669
[snarling, growling]

886

899
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,588
- There's cough medicine in there. Don't touch that.
- Yeah.

900
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:09,890
Like l said, l did hear a good joke, though.

901
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,433
Whats the difference between Michael Jackson
and plastic bags?

902
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:14,297
What?.

903
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,267
One is used to carry your groceries.

904
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,941
The other is dangerous for children to play with.

905
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:19,973
[laughs]

906
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:38,785

00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:41,828
No more Barry Manilow, please.

909
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:43,693
lt helps me relax Cedric.

910
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,663
l'd rather listen to fuckin' Barbra Streisand.

911
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:46,597
Barry's the man.

912
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,327
l can't believe this, man.

913
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:49,597

00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,107
Gentlemen, gentlemen. Gentlemen.

933
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:09,541
We don't want to be rude to our guest.

934
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:13,542
Jakeem.

935
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:14,546
The infamous.

936
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,616
How are you?

937
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:19,413
l told you. l don't know what you're talking about.

938
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:22,090
Whatd you tell me? l didn't ask you anything yet.

939
00:59:22,258 --> 00:59:23,850
How do you know what l'll ask?.

940
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,051
My name is Cedric.

941
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:30,063
Those men you murdered, those men were mine.

942
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:33,064
That amulet you stole, that belonged to me.

943
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:34,065
Now,

944
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,601
the questioning begins.

945
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:36,932
Are you ready?.

946
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:39,668
Who'd you steal that for?.

947
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,174
l told you. l don't know what you're talkin' about.

948
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:43,642
Really?. Really?.

949
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:48,339
Why would you come into my home, steal my amulet,

950
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:50,418
and kill four of my men?

951
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,383
Good men.

952
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,057
- l don't know if l believe him.
- You don't know?.

953
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:56,418
This motherfucker's lying.

954
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,119
Security cameras watched you shoot one of my men
in the leg,

955
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:02,196
so you had to have something to do with something.

956
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:04,195
Can you give me some information?

957
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:06,157
Talk!

958
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:08,600
You realize that you're just a vampire dog?

959
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,304
Huh?

960
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,270
lf you couldn't go out in the daylight,

961
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:15,273
you'd be just as dead as my men.

962
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,679
Since you don't want to tell me the story, l tell you
what.

963
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:21,441
Okay.

964
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,256
l used to pitch forthe triple A.

965
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:31,086
Only reasons l never made it to the majors

966
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,558
was because l only had one pitch.

967
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,061
A hundred-mile-an-hourfastball.

968
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,926
Kinda defines me.

969
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,761
Straightforward and hard.

970
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,800
So now we're gonna play a game. You ready?.

971
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:43,768
Get my shit. Get my shit.

972
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:48,173
Now we're gonna play a game. You know what the
game is?

973
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:50,812
Three strikes and Jakeem tells me all l wanna know.

974
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,708
Ready?.

975
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,443
Get the fuck outta here.

976
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:58,519
You lcok just like my catcher, baby.

977
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,985
Get outta town. So what are we sayin'?

978
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:02,887
Yeah!

979
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:06,391
Yeah! Check this out. Clear me some space, y'all.

980
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:07,826
Play ball!

981
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:08,953
Batter up!

982
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:10,963
Now, l'm gonna ask you one time.

983
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,159
We can end this now or we can go through yourthree
strikes.

984
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:15,361
Give me a sign.

985
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,904
Oh, your hands are behind you.

986
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:20,065
l just assume you gave me the number one. How's
that?.

987
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:21,502
You ready?.

988
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:22,439
Fuck you!

989
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:23,703
Here comes the first one.

990
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,711
Give me a sign. Huh? Ready?.

991
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:26,904
Fuck you!

992
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:30,483
[laughter]

993
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:31,483
Hang tough!

994
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:34,020
- Oh, shit!
- He got heart!

995
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,055
He got heart, don't he? Which ear y'all waht?.

996
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:37,817
- Left!
- Which one? Ready?.

997
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:39,985
Here it comes. You ain't got nothin' for me?

998
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:42,427
We can make this end now. l'll take that ear.

999
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:43,621
We can make it end.

1000
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:44,892
Huh? Nothing?

1001
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,228
Okay, here we go.

1002
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,495
Here it comes!

1003
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:50,571
Whooee!

1005
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,432
[all yelling agreement]

1006
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:55,201
Hit him again!

1007
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,444
Gentlemen.

1008
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:00,609
Whats going on, Ced?

1009
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,775
Just rappin' with our boy, Jakeem.

1010
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:05,046
You know, tryin' to find out whats goin' on.

1011
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:06,314
Just tryin' to figure out.

1012
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:07,354
''Rappin'''?

1013
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:10,052
Gimme the ball.

1014
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:11,883
What ball?

1015
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,359
Give me the ball.

1016
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:19,827
What we got?.

1017
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,403
The amulet. Thats first.

1018
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:23,834
But as far as information,

1019
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:26,771
this vampire dog dcesn't wanna give us any.

1020
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,409
Kinda tight lipped, but

1021
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,909
we'll get it out of him.

1022
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,512
We're just gettin' friendly, right?.

1023
01:02:32,882 --> 01:02:34,440
Lcok...

1024
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,581
l told you l don't know what you're talking about.

1025
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:39,618
Bullshit.

1026
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:42,586
Yeah, l did steal the amulet.

1027
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,191
But it wasn't my choice.

1028
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,055
You had choices, Jakeem.

1029
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,593
They were all bad,

1030
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,197
but you had choices.

1031
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:53,525
Do you have any idea the powerthis amulet has?

1032
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,136
Don't answerrthat.

1033
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:56,896
Do you have any idea

1034
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,768
what would have happened had Khalil got his hands
on it?.

1035
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:02,240
He would have beern invincible

1036
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:04,005
to everything we have,

1037
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:05,680
including daylight.

1038
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:08,248
Or do vampire flunkies like you even care?

1039
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,745
- Some shit funny?.
- Whats funny?.

1040
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,898
You're a bunch of stupid motherfuckers.

1041
01:03:26,502 --> 01:03:28,868
Why the fuck do you keep that amulet around?

1042
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:31,037
Huh?

1043
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,073
So some evil mastermind can steal the shit?.

1044
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,268
And take overrthe world?

1045
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:37,106
Oh, wait, wait.

1046
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:38,177
Are y'all vampires?

1047
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:39,814
Do we lcok like motherfuckin' vampires?

1048
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,813
Then what the fuck you need the amulet for?.

1049
01:03:42,018 --> 01:03:44,179

1050

01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:48,683
Lets go.

I have a severe, severe vampire problem.

1275
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:25,419

01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,291
I run a mortuary business.

01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:37,455
I got people coming out of theirgraves left and right.

1281
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:41,899
You know how expensive it is
to bury people again and again?

1282
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:43,504
Families are going nuts!

1283
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,697
Nobody's here, man.

1284
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,069
Oh, youre killin'me.

1285
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:48,904
Look, look, look, I'll do anything.

1286
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:51,169
Just send somebody now.

1287
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:53,873
I'll pay ten grand.

1288
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:55,380
How much?

1289
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,178
Ten grand.

1290
01:21:00,655 --> 01:21:02,452
ls that cash?

1291
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:23,304
- These days I'm always tryin'to get at myself -

1292
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:25,877
- Stressin; always workin'
to impress myself -

1293
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:27,639
- You see
I gotta be, gotta be -

1294
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:30,374
- The number one, that's
my philosophy, honestly -

1295
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,076
- I feel like
the world's on top of me -

1296
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:34,620
- Stoppin'me from movin'forward ever constantly -

1297
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:38,122
- I M.C. because I'm not
the type to silently, quietly -

1298
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:40,818
- Stand by, I got a life
to lead, time to see -

1299
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:43,396
- I know a man named me
that I gotta be -

1300
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:45,965
- And fuck they, he and she
'cause it's not me -

1301
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:48,864
- Know what I'm sayin'
What ain't real about havin'a job -

1302
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,129
- What the fuck isn't real
about havin'a love -

1303
01:21:51,273 --> 01:21:53,901
- The same shit that's real about bein'a thug -

1304
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:56,509
- The same shit that's real about a shotgun slug -

1305
01:21:56,678 --> 01:21:59,112
- The same shit that's real about college degrees -

1306
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:00,441
- 'Cause that's the shit
that got me kickin'out -

1307
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:01,810
- Makin'these Gs -

1308
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:02,848
- My brother Steve's
on the court -

1309
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:04,541
- 'Cause to ball is his dream -

1310
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,017
- Mind the rhyme, how it is
how it always has been -

1311
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:08,212
- See it's not
the lines that you read -

1312
01:22:08,356 --> 01:22:09,755
- But the shit in between -

1313
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,586
- Thugs is made out of dirt
yet I still stay clean -

1314
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:13,658
- Because I'm real -

1315
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:16,262
- This is for all my people ridin'the trains
Stay real -

1316
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:18,126
- Just to go to work
in small-time chains -

1317
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:20,824
- The really real livin'poor
so it's not in their place -

1318
01:22:21,002 --> 01:22:22,993
- I stay real, don't give
a damn what haters will say -

1319
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:25,868
- I keep it real
Yeah, I know these days it'sjust a clich -

1320
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:28,474
- But I was real
way before you saw me on TV-

1321
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:31,077
- I'm still real 'cause my momma brought me up that
way -

1322
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:33,441
- I'm really real 'cause I'm made of blood and not
money -

1323
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:36,277
- I'm what's real, really real
This is something you feel -

1324
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:37,678
- I say real, you say real -

1325
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:39,081
- 'Cause it's something
you feel -

1326
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,710
- For all my real people
that I cann feel -

1327
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:41,947
- Put up your hands
Pump your fists -

1328
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:43,717
- Make some noise
if you will -

1329
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:46,086
- I'm what's real, real, real
This is something you feel -

1330
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,787
- In you room, in your ride
on your box outside -

1331
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:51,296
- In your headphones
launchin'at you side to side -

1332
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:54,867
- On your bus when you know
you got a long-ass ride -

1333
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:57,436
- Remember them days -

1334
01:22:57,605 --> 01:23:00,039
- Cats with the fat lip
seemed to have it all made -

1335
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,310
- And I love when my people livin'right and on type
-

1336
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,870
- But jealousy is a bitch... -
