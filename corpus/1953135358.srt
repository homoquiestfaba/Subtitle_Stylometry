1
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:10,148
Quiet. Listen. Listen!

2
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,110
Shit, this is scary.

3
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:27,231
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ!

4
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:33,063
-They've gone. Let's go.
-No.

5
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:36,230
Listen. Listen.

6
00:01:36,408 --> 00:01:38,638
-They are coming back down.
-Oh, God.

7
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:44,275
Steckler.

8
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:46,974
Steckler.

9
00:01:47,286 --> 00:01:49,413
-lt's him! lt's him!
-Who?

10
00:01:49,588 --> 00:01:50,850
-Oh, my God.
-What?

11
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:52,751
What is he doing in this country?

12
00:01:53,325 --> 00:01:59,025
Oh, Steckler, why don't you talk to me?

13
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:02,634
l know you are out there, Steckler.

14
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:05,428
Steckler, what's going on?

15
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:08,834
You have stolen something
from us, Steckler.

16
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:11,874
l've come a long way to get it back.

17
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:17,105
Return it and we will be good friends
again. <i>Jawohl,</i> Steckler?

18
00:02:17,683 --> 00:02:22,347
Oh, by the way, Steckler, that first
little sale that you arranged...

19
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:24,250
...we had to cancel that.

20
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:29,486
That lovely agent from the German
government was very upset with you...

21
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:33,562
...when you double-crossed him.
l think he would have killed you...

22
00:02:33,732 --> 00:02:36,860
...so we killed him instead.
We cut off his head.

23
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:41,235
Oh, God!

24
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,705
Steckler.

25
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:02,816
Pull over. We'll chew the fat a little.

26
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:08,560
Oh, God! What are you doing? No. No!

27
00:03:08,834 --> 00:03:10,825
<i>Nein</i>!

28
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:27,378
-That's it. Come on.
-Halt! Steckler! Halt!

29
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:54,636
Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no. No. No!

30
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:56,974
Please!

31
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:11,725
Come on, come on, come on!

32
00:04:11,897 --> 00:04:14,422
Shut up, you sex fiends!

33
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:18,566
-Ma'am, what do you want us to do?
-Arrest them. You're the Vice Squad.

34
00:04:18,737 --> 00:04:20,136
lt's not against the law.

35
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:24,739
You horse! You big horse! Oh!

36
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,777
You moose! Oh! You elephant!

37
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:30,005
She's got the <i>Wild Kingdom</i> in there.

38
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:34,481
-What are you gonna do?
-l think we ought to sell tickets.

39
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:36,348
Hey, hey, are you guys cops?

40
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:39,786
Are you gonna do something about
Mae West and Harry Reems in there?

41
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:43,587
Every night, humpety-hump,
sloshety-slosh.

42
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:46,560
l feel like l'm living
in a Pussycat Theatre.

43
00:04:46,732 --> 00:04:49,098
Stuff a sock in it, you degenerate!

44
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:51,667
Jesus Christ, every fucking night!

45
00:04:57,776 --> 00:05:02,042
Goddamn. Change coats with me.

46
00:05:08,787 --> 00:05:10,880
Get away from that door.
You'll catch something.

47
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:15,516
Sir, l'm Dr. Ballsup from the
District of Columbia Health Department.

48
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:18,354
This is a spot check, sir.

49
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,964
Hi. l'm Dr. Ballsup
from the Health Department.

50
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,899
You're wearing a condom
at this time, are you not?

51
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:29,006
Condom? Well, no.
l left it home on the dresser.

52
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:30,968
Oh, well, we've heard that before.

53
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:37,571
l'm afraid l'll have to cite you
under D.C. Statute 3086942-64.

54
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:39,580
-ls this a joke?
-No, ma'am.

55
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:42,149
Safe sex in the '80s is no joke.

56
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,724
Officer Delaney, you have any of those
indiscriminate-copulation citation forms?

57
00:05:48,827 --> 00:05:50,351
You know, l'm fresh out.

58
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:53,655
-Well, it has been a busy week--
-Did we use the--? The orgy, yes.

59
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:58,326
Come on, fellas, give me a break.
My wife lost her job. My kid's been sick.

60
00:05:58,937 --> 00:06:01,872
Sir, have you ever been cited for
D.C. Ordinance 9....

61
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,530
-30869...
-Nine....

62
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,766
...42-64?

63
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:08,902
No, sirs. Never. Swear to God.
Look, l always carry one in my wallet.

64
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:12,107
l just used the last one.
See, there's the indentation.

65
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:14,285
-He is correct about the indentation.
-l see.

66
00:06:14,453 --> 00:06:17,616
-Why don't you give him a break?
-Okay.

67
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:21,381
Well, since we don't have the proper
forms and this is your first offence...

68
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,360
...l'll let you off with a warning. But l'm
gonna ask you to cease and desist...

69
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,397
...until such time as you have
obtained another condom.

70
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:31,798
Now, please, sir, let's all practice
safe sex, shall we?

71
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,600
lt's for your safety as well as for ours.
Have a nice night.

72
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:39,073
Keep your nose clean.

73
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:43,047
Stern, you're crazier
than they said you were.

74
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:49,251
Hey, Stern, wait up.
l got a message from the captain.

75
00:06:49,488 --> 00:06:51,115
Send a singing telegram.

76
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:57,125
Well, well, MacArthur Stern, supercop.
How's things out on the sleaze patrol?

77
00:06:57,295 --> 00:07:00,287
Boy, the gaudier the cop,
the snappier the patter.

78
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:02,956
What's on your mind, Weskit,
besides stale material?

79
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:06,400
You know what you guys ought to do?
Every time you bust a whore...

80
00:07:06,571 --> 00:07:10,405
...you ought to paint a little tit
on the side of your car to keep score.

81
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:14,067
Oh, Weskit, l don't want to use the
five points of lQ it would take...

82
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:17,147
...to have a battle of wits with you.
What the hell do you want?

83
00:07:17,315 --> 00:07:20,910
Captain's bringing you back to Homicide.
Got a briefing in the morning at 8 a.m.

84
00:07:21,086 --> 00:07:22,849
The porno murders.

85
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:24,921
Yeah, you being an expert in the field.

86
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,787
l give you three days, and then
you're back in the toilet.

87
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,360
Who am l partnered with?
Anybody l know?

88
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:37,366
You kidding? Nobody you know will work
with you. You're gonna love this guy.

89
00:07:37,536 --> 00:07:38,594
What's so funny?

90
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,933
So this is the old Woody
you were always working on.

91
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:44,598
lt's beautiful.
Looks like a diner l used to eat in.

92
00:07:44,776 --> 00:07:48,803
Hey. Do you know what
this car represents?

93
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,007
Hey, what do you think, l'm ignorant?
l read that psychology crap.

94
00:07:53,185 --> 00:07:55,551
-lt represents your dick.
-What?

95
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,517
That's right. An automobile
represents a man's dick.

96
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:02,391
lt's an extension of your penis.

97
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:06,725
This Woody represents
what you want your dick to be.

98
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:11,164
Actually, l think you're flattering yourself.
You ought to be driving a compact.

99
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:13,998
Hyundai or something like that.

100
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:20,534
You're disgusting, Weskit. This doesn't
represent my dick. lt represents order.

101
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:22,839
-Order?
-That's right, order.

102
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:29,351
When l slide this key into that ignition
and l hear that engine purr...

103
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:34,515
...l know there's order in the universe.
There's continuity.

104
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:38,026
There's a continuum.

105
00:08:38,196 --> 00:08:39,527
Do you know what l mean?

106
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:43,560
That's some deep shit, Stern.

107
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:49,364
l give you two days.
Maybe one. One day. One day.

108
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,169
You should write a book, Weskit.

109
00:08:52,344 --> 00:08:54,904
<i>Me and My Lobotomy.</i>

110
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:00,710
All right, all right.

111
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:12,793
Ellis!

112
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:15,398
Ellis!

113
00:09:25,443 --> 00:09:30,745
l just talked to the captain.
He said if you're ready, he is.

114
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,386
-Are you ready, Ellis?
-You're the doctor.

115
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:40,615
Clinically, l think you're ready.
l want to know what you feel.

116
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:44,327
l'm as sane as most people.

117
00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:46,291
You'll have to face violence again.

118
00:09:46,464 --> 00:09:48,762
lf you're going into police work,
you know that.

119
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:52,767
l know. We discussed that.
We dealt with it.

120
00:09:52,937 --> 00:09:56,338
lf l have to, l have to. And l will.

121
00:09:56,541 --> 00:10:01,501
Just don't be afraid to fail. Failure and
recovery is the natural order of things.

122
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,945
Don't worry about me, Father.
l'll be fine.

123
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:07,277
l haven't had a fragmentary episode
in months.

124
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:12,287
You're right. Absolutely.
You're the sanest person l know.

125
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:16,188
Actually, that's not very encouraging
coming from you. You're a psychiatrist.

126
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:19,990
Everyone you know is crazy. Or celibate.

127
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:24,192
Come on. l'll help you pack.

128
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:59,297
MacArthur Stern?

129
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:00,868
Yeah.

130
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:03,837
Capt. Doggett sent us out to get you.

131
00:11:04,008 --> 00:11:07,569
Oh. l oversleep a little
and they send the cops on me.

132
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:10,408
There's been another killing.

133
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:15,713
-And they want us to go there now, right?
-That's what the captain says.

134
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:19,220
Nice place. Decorate it yourself?

135
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:21,757
Fuck you.

136
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:27,521
Goddamn it, it's hot.
lt must be 1 1 0 out here.

137
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:32,398
-Hey, Mac. How you been?
-Hey. Remember Camus?

138
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,834
Yeah. How's Claire?

139
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:39,409
-Claire? Claire's a born-again Christian.
-Go on. She's a Catholic.

140
00:11:39,577 --> 00:11:43,570
Every time l go see my son, calls me
the Antichrist and hides under the bed.

141
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:45,409
Oh. Over here.

142
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,414
What's going on here?

143
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:55,215
-What the hell you got there, Stern?
-What, this? This is a cat.

144
00:11:55,393 --> 00:11:57,918
Gonna track the killers with it?
Most people use dogs.

145
00:11:58,096 --> 00:11:59,893
Come on, Weskit, we know it's a cat.

146
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:02,794
That's really funny, Weskit.

147
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:04,958
l had a fire in my apartment this morning.

148
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,664
l didn't want to leave him in the car,
so l-- What do you got here?

149
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:13,275
Male, Caucasian,
teeth extracted, fingerprints zapped.

150
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:16,107
Here's where they pulled
the boat in to dump the body.

151
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:18,772
Must have been pretty big,
from the size of the hole.

152
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,441
Over at Quiller's Boatyard,
l've got two more bodies.

153
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:24,110
Counting four from the
other night, that makes seven.

154
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:28,419
Wow. What's with this guy? Who is he?

155
00:12:28,593 --> 00:12:34,691
That man possesses the keenest
analytical mind l've ever seen, bar none.

156
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:40,398
Hey, Ellis, how you feeling? Come on,
pal. l want you to meet somebody.

157
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:43,166
l want you to meet your new partner.

158
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:46,208
Ellis Fielding, Mac Stern.

159
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:53,416
People just don't like you, Stern.

160
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:57,146
Let's get out of here. We're going to
the boatyard. Wrap it up here, Weskit.

161
00:12:57,322 --> 00:13:01,520
-Yeah, you love me, don't you baby?
-Okay, okay, let's go. Get him in a bag.

162
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:15,029
lt's inspiring to see a great
analytical mind at work.

163
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,175
Just wait. Just wait.

164
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:25,514
Tell him to slow down, will you?
l want to take some notes.

165
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:28,479
Go on, make cracks.

166
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:33,020
What's he doing now?

167
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:38,656
Hey, hey, somebody call a cop.

168
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,257
What?

169
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:47,500
Jesus Christ, another one.
A gorilla was murdered?

170
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:51,809
A guy in a gorilla suit was murdered at
the Hookers' Ball about a mile downriver.

171
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:55,412
-That explains the costumes.
-Okay, captain.

172
00:13:59,017 --> 00:14:01,212
-You find something?
-lt's pretty clear, sir.

173
00:14:01,386 --> 00:14:03,013
Let's hear it.

174
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:09,683
Well, okay. lt happened
approximately like this.

175
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:14,594
That launch there was being pursued
by another, probably larger, powerboat.

176
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,097
The launch came up out of
the water at high speed...

177
00:14:17,302 --> 00:14:19,270
...sailed through all this debris here...

178
00:14:19,437 --> 00:14:22,873
...and then, before final impact,
two victims were thrown clear.

179
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,169
Then when the launch finally
came to rest, two other gentlemen...

180
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:29,905
...one dressed as the Queen of Hearts
from <i>Alice in Wonderland...</i>

181
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:32,549
...and the other, probably dressed
as the Mad Hatter...

182
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:34,241
...jumped out of the boat and ran.

183
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:37,047
Then someone in the powerboat
on the water opened fire.

184
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:39,280
And over the fence went
the Queen of Hearts.

185
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:41,687
Oh, boy, the Queen of Hearts. Good.

186
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:45,852
Now we'll finally find out who
painted the roses red, won't we?

187
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:51,263
Now, at this point, all the men
in the powerboat came ashore.

188
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:55,400
Someone killed the rabbit right here,
where the body was found.

189
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,507
Then two men chased the fat man
dressed as the Queen of Hearts...

190
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:00,200
...but he got away.

191
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:03,937
Someone tormented the German
gentleman dressed as the Cheshire Cat.

192
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:08,074
He taunted him from here all the way
over to here, then shot him.

193
00:15:08,252 --> 00:15:11,050
Here, where the body was found.

194
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:14,149
That's as detailed as l can be
with cursory examination.

195
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:18,256
lt's reasonably accurate. l could
answer questions now if you want.

196
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:20,659
Do you want them
one at a time or all together?

197
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:24,392
-Oh, give them to me all at once.
-Okay. How do you know the gunfire...

198
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:26,264
...came from this alleged powerboat?

199
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:28,905
How do you know anybody escaped,
let alone two people?

200
00:15:29,073 --> 00:15:31,837
How do you know one guy
was dressed as the Queen of Hearts?

201
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,377
How do you know he was overweight?
How do you know this guy was German?

202
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:37,547
How do you know
that he was tormented?

203
00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:39,683
Finally, how do you know
any of this shit?

204
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:42,286
Physical evidence.

205
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:45,650
Look at all these hits around here
l've marked with the yellow pegs...

206
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:48,815
...and up on the doors.

207
00:15:48,993 --> 00:15:52,759
-That could have come from the shore.
-No.

208
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,022
Why?

209
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:57,298
l pulled all kinds of .30 caliber
slugs and shells out of here.

210
00:15:57,535 --> 00:16:00,265
You've gotta admit that's
weird ordnance for an amateur.

211
00:16:00,505 --> 00:16:03,440
l figure the guy must have been a pro.
Look at the door.

212
00:16:03,675 --> 00:16:05,768
Looks like the Dow Jones
lndustrial Average.

213
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:09,174
No professional marksman is that
inaccurate, indicating the firing began...

214
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:12,646
...when the boat was bobbing in the
water, hence the erratic pattern of fire.

215
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:15,786
How do you know the guy
dressed as the Queen of Hearts was fat?

216
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:19,913
l found this scrap of costume
here on the fence...

217
00:16:20,158 --> 00:16:26,461
...indicating whoever wore it got over
the fence. Look, you see this flower?

218
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:30,533
See? This flower. See?

219
00:16:30,702 --> 00:16:36,971
lt's a rose. See the rose?
lt's a rose worn by the Queen of Hearts.

220
00:16:37,141 --> 00:16:40,201
See? Everybody knows her eye.
See, there's her eye.

221
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:45,472
So if we project just how large this card
might have been on a costume...

222
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,813
...we can conclude that the man
who wore it was of great bulk.

223
00:16:48,986 --> 00:16:51,887
That's why l figure there were two men.
The guy who wore this...

224
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:54,752
...was probably too huge
to get over the fence without help.

225
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,490
Pray continue.

226
00:16:56,661 --> 00:17:00,825
l know this man was tormented because
he's got a broken leg with the tibia...

227
00:17:00,998 --> 00:17:04,365
...protruding through. lt would have been
agonizing for him to move at all...

228
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:06,696
...much less crawl the 30 feet
he was forced to.

229
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:10,839
-How do you know he's German?
-That's the neatest of all.

230
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:15,445
The killers were very meticulous in
removing all identifying objects. Details.

231
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:21,779
They overlooked one thing. Look closely.
You see, he's had his leg broken before.

232
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:25,045
Probably snapped it skiing.
At least that's what it looks like.

233
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:27,282
Joe, give me what we extracted.

234
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:31,223
We pulled out this surgical repair pin.
You can read:

235
00:17:35,566 --> 00:17:37,864
A West German domestic
medical supply company.

236
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:40,697
-They were clumsy in overlooking this.
-Those morons.

237
00:17:40,872 --> 00:17:43,204
He might have been
another nationality and...

238
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:47,901
...just had his leg broken and set in
Germany, but there is corroboration.

239
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:56,079
-What do you see?
-A crotch. l don't much like it.

240
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:59,783
-The shorts, though.
-Yeah?

241
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:05,896
There's no fly. No pee-pee hole.
No opening, you know, European-style.

242
00:18:07,832 --> 00:18:10,733
That's it in a nutshell.

243
00:18:11,936 --> 00:18:15,599
Detective Stern, l was most impressed
by your recall of detail...

244
00:18:15,773 --> 00:18:19,971
...in your querying of my account.
You've a very adequate mind.

245
00:18:20,144 --> 00:18:22,806
Well, thank you very much.

246
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,575
l'll go see how they're doing on the other
bodies, especially the headless one.

247
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:30,187
Oh, right, Ellis, right.
Hey, great work, great work.

248
00:18:30,354 --> 00:18:34,154
-How you doing?
-l'm fine.

249
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:37,783
-Thanks for the chance, Uncle Del.
-Well, that's great, that's great.

250
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:39,953
-l gotta talk to Mac for a minute.
-Okay.

251
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:44,534
-Check the registration on that launch.
-Hey, this guy is sharp.

252
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, yeah?

253
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:50,637
There's something wrong with that dude.

254
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:53,368
You know your problem, Mac?
You have no charity.

255
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:57,070
Hey, what is this,
''Doo-doo on Mac'' week?

256
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:08,051
My training's in forensics,
ballistics, police science.

257
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:10,490
John Jay College, '7 4-'79.

258
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:14,358
Would you mind turning that off, please?
lt disrupts my energy patterns.

259
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:17,228
Well, we can't have that, can we?

260
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:22,304
Forensics? l guess that's where you
developed your observational powers.

261
00:19:22,473 --> 00:19:24,805
-Hold the wheel for a second, will you?
-What?

262
00:19:24,976 --> 00:19:26,841
Hold this for a second.
l gotta do this.

263
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:33,040
Mr. Stern.
What are you going to do with that?

264
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:37,985
What do you think l'm going to do with it,
kid? l'm gonna roll a cigarette...

265
00:19:38,155 --> 00:19:41,249
...then l'm gonna smoke it.
l bet you don't like cigarettes, do you?

266
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:44,724
-Give off bad vibes?
-No, they make my eyes burn...

267
00:19:44,896 --> 00:19:46,887
-...and my lungs hurt.
-l see.

268
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:48,497
So do you mind?

269
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:56,839
lt's a nasty habit anyway.

270
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:01,774
So you've been in Narcotics
all this time?

271
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:05,846
No, actually l've been on sick leave
for much of the last two years.

272
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:09,581
What's wrong?

273
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:13,055
ls this a cat?

274
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:16,192
No, that's a giraffe.

275
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:19,959
Of course it's a cat. Why?

276
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:24,028
Will your cat always be coming
on assignments with us?

277
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:28,132
No, my cat almost never will be
with us on assignments.

278
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:29,864
Just very special ones.

279
00:20:30,308 --> 00:20:35,041
Actually, l had to leave my apartment
this morning on short notice.

280
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:38,415
l'm allergic to cats.
Would you mind if l cover him up?

281
00:20:40,418 --> 00:20:42,386
No, Ellis, go ahead. Cover up my cat.

282
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:47,446
l'll bet you're allergic to
a lot of things, aren't you?

283
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:53,559
-l'm annoying you, aren't l?
-Just a teensy little bit, really....

284
00:20:53,998 --> 00:20:58,264
Anything else about me
that annoys you? Anything at all?

285
00:20:58,436 --> 00:21:00,563
-No.
-No?

286
00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:05,698
-Come on, there must be one little thing.
-No, no, nothing.

287
00:21:05,943 --> 00:21:11,279
Really? Let's be frank now.
My driving. What about my driving?

288
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:14,475
Since you mentioned it,
could you possibly drive a bit slower?

289
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,990
l always annoy people. l don't mean to.

290
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:36,968
ls there anything else about me
that l need to improve?

291
00:21:37,141 --> 00:21:40,941
-Anything at all?
-No, sir.

292
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:43,777
Absolutely nothing.

293
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:48,677
l'm gonna drive now. Real slow.

294
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:51,287
-Okay.
-Okay?

295
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:08,669
Hi, Rachel. Hey, come here,
you little son of a bitch! Goddamn it!

296
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:12,236
-l'll meet you in the morgue.
-All right.

297
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,243
Get him out of here.
He's slobbering all over my desk.

298
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:16,710
-Rachel.
-Mac.

299
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:18,746
Like your slacks. Are they tailored?

300
00:22:18,916 --> 00:22:21,476
First day back, starting with that
sexist stuff again?

301
00:22:21,652 --> 00:22:24,553
Hey, let's put it this way,
l'd rather be sexist than racist.

302
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:30,422
You're not sexist, you're just crude.
Oh, poor baby. Having a bad day?

303
00:22:30,594 --> 00:22:33,495
Having a terrible day.
Say something nice to me, will you?

304
00:22:33,664 --> 00:22:35,859
You have very strong-looking thighs
for a white man.

305
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:39,491
l like that, yeah.
Hey, would you be honest with me?

306
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,501
Am l selfish and self-centered?

307
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:45,369
No, but l have figured out
what's wrong with you.

308
00:22:45,543 --> 00:22:48,273
Wait a minute.
Was there a recent symposium?

309
00:22:48,446 --> 00:22:50,175
Everybody on the planet
get together...

310
00:22:50,347 --> 00:22:52,281
...and discuss what's wrong
with Mac Stern?

311
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,850
l was just gonna say
you need a good woman.

312
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:56,179
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

313
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:59,288
-You want to live with me?
-l hear you don't live anywhere.

314
00:22:59,457 --> 00:23:01,049
Well, that's true.

315
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,086
Well, what about my cat living
with you? Just till l find a place.

316
00:23:05,262 --> 00:23:08,095
-Okay, Mac. What's his name?
-Camus.

317
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:12,961
-Camus? He's not suicidal, is he?
-That's good.

318
00:23:13,137 --> 00:23:14,365
Oh, wait a minute.

319
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:17,632
Captain said to tell you they've
identified the owner of the boat...

320
00:23:17,842 --> 00:23:20,208
...those guys were killed in.

321
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:24,541
Harry Gutterman. Harry ''The Hippo.''
Porno dealer.

322
00:23:24,715 --> 00:23:27,946
Gutterman?
What is that, his stage name?

323
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:31,054
He owns a little S & M club
down in the industrial district.

324
00:23:31,222 --> 00:23:35,625
Captain said to be sure you take note,
the guy weighs 350 pounds.

325
00:23:35,893 --> 00:23:37,918
What's that mean?

326
00:23:38,095 --> 00:23:40,393
Queen of Hearts.

327
00:23:40,564 --> 00:23:45,001
-Son of a gun. Queen of Hearts.
-Queen of Hearts.

328
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:50,907
S & M club?
Like sadism and masochism?

329
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:55,409
Yeah, you know, you scratch my back,
l'll scratch yours. Only real hard.

330
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:57,479
l can't go into a club like that.

331
00:23:57,648 --> 00:24:00,242
We're not gonna join,
we're just gonna question a witness.

332
00:24:00,484 --> 00:24:04,147
Well, l know, but-- You know, it's not
that l'm a Trudy Prudy or anything.

333
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:08,587
-What? What is it?
-lt's that whole concept of pain and....

334
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:12,320
Look, it's part of the job, kid.

335
00:24:12,496 --> 00:24:14,088
l know. l know.

336
00:24:14,265 --> 00:24:15,664
Don't get me wrong, okay?

337
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:20,497
But did you ever stop to think that maybe
you're not ideally suited for police work?

338
00:24:20,771 --> 00:24:21,999
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

339
00:24:22,173 --> 00:24:25,438
-Lots of times.
-Look. lf anybody is rude to you...

340
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:30,478
...you just tell your old Uncle Mac, and
l'm gonna give them such a smack.

341
00:24:30,648 --> 00:24:32,172
-Okay, thanks.
-Okay.

342
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:02,069
Look at this. A subculture based on
pain and degradation.

343
00:25:02,246 --> 00:25:05,340
l'm not a prude. l don't think it's
disgusting. l think it's stupid.

344
00:25:05,516 --> 00:25:07,211
Can l help you?

345
00:25:07,384 --> 00:25:10,717
Yeah, you can. Get us a couple of
Shirley Temples, would you?

346
00:25:10,888 --> 00:25:12,048
-Shirley Temples?
-Yeah.

347
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:14,589
You know, it's that red fizzy shit
in a tall glass...

348
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:18,660
-...got a cherry and a couple straws in it.
-On your way. This is a private club.

349
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:20,660
-He's right. Come on.
-No, wait a minute.

350
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:23,356
That's unconstitutional,
not to mention impolite.

351
00:25:23,534 --> 00:25:26,765
l came here to see Mr. Gutterman.
You fix that drink for me or l'll--

352
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:31,670
-No drinks without a membership card.
-What is this?

353
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:35,778
Here's my membership card.
Lets me go anyplace l want to go.

354
00:25:36,046 --> 00:25:39,038
Right now, l want to go through that
green door to see the place...

355
00:25:39,216 --> 00:25:42,879
...where you guys take those cigarette
butts and put them out in your navels.

356
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:44,782
Fake badges are cheap.
Show it again.

357
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:50,086
Hey, you! Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Get out--

358
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:52,286
Hey!

359
00:25:53,864 --> 00:25:55,092
Ellis!

360
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,936
What are you doing? Give me a hand
here, would you? Come on, Ellis!

361
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:05,766
-Ellis!
-l just can't deal with the violence.

362
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,541
Now you tell me!

363
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:31,792
Excuse me for a minute.
Please, everyone!

364
00:26:31,969 --> 00:26:33,960
Please, quiet, please!
Would you, please?

365
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:38,131
Hello, how are you? Albert Glendenning.
How are you? Albert--

366
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:40,971
Please! Please! Thank you very much.

367
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:44,808
l'm Albert Glendenning. l'm your
director of sports and recreation today.

368
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:49,951
And we're going to learn how
to box the correct way. Now--

369
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:56,618
Put them up! Put them up! Come on.

370
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,091
l'll fight you with one hand
tied behind my back. Come on.

371
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:01,925
Who's next? Who's next?

372
00:27:05,135 --> 00:27:10,539
Come on, come on, come on.
l'll fight you with my eyes closed.

373
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:12,699
-l don't really know this guy.
-You nervous?

374
00:27:12,976 --> 00:27:14,671
-Come on--
-Look what we have here, boys.

375
00:27:14,845 --> 00:27:17,973
A really big pussy.

376
00:27:19,817 --> 00:27:22,183
You gotta ask yourself one question:

377
00:27:22,353 --> 00:27:26,722
Do you feel lucky, punk? Do you?

378
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:29,022
Do you?

379
00:27:29,293 --> 00:27:33,696
Out of the West, through a cloud of dust,
with a hearty ''Hi-yo, Silver!''...

380
00:27:33,864 --> 00:27:39,302
...rides the Lone Ranger with his
faithful lndian companion, Tonto.

381
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,908
Hi-yo, Silver!

382
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:01,983
Hold it! Hold it. Get up there. Come on.

383
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:05,057
Spread them, come on.
Spread them. Get up.

384
00:28:05,229 --> 00:28:08,323
Come on, get up. Spread them.

385
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:13,831
Hold it right there, butterball.
Come on, get over there.

386
00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:17,269
Hey! Nothing doing. Get back in line.
Come on. Everybody get back.

387
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:20,171
Party's over. Come on.

388
00:28:22,246 --> 00:28:26,012
Jesus, Joseph, Mary and all the saints.
Ellis, are you all right?

389
00:28:26,183 --> 00:28:30,381
Was l--? Did l--? Oh, no.

390
00:28:30,554 --> 00:28:34,923
Yeah. Yeah, l'm fine, Mac.

391
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:39,426
-Yeah.
-What the hell were you doing out there?

392
00:28:39,596 --> 00:28:43,555
A diversionary tactic. You know,
the old lroquois shaman trick...

393
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:47,568
...where you make them think
you're crazy, throw them off guard.

394
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:49,706
Worked like a charm. Didn't it?

395
00:28:49,873 --> 00:28:52,433
Where'd you learn that,
John Jay College?

396
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:55,908
Well, graduate studies. After.

397
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,706
Call the precinct, get some help.

398
00:28:57,881 --> 00:29:02,978
Sure, Mac. All right,
Metropolitan Police. Clear the way here.

399
00:29:04,054 --> 00:29:08,457
Don't move or l'll shoot. You move,
l swear to God, l'll blow your brains out.

400
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:11,492
You moved! Didn't you hear what l said?

401
00:29:11,695 --> 00:29:16,064
What are you, deaf, or what?
Don't you see this? You wanna get hurt?

402
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:19,430
-Are you guys really cops?
-l am. l don't know what the hell he is.

403
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:22,003
Shit, l can't tell the good guys
from the bad guys.

404
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:25,334
The only time l'm gonna feel safe
is if l shoot everybody.

405
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:29,275
l'm a nervous wreck. l'm so sorry
l looked at it. Why did l look at it?

406
00:29:29,446 --> 00:29:32,904
Because l'm a schmuck, that's why.
lf you're a cop, l demand protection.

407
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:36,109
You hear? l want protection.
Don't you understand they're crazy?

408
00:29:36,286 --> 00:29:38,652
They're killing everybody who saw it.
Everybody!

409
00:29:38,922 --> 00:29:41,516
You testify, we'll put you in
a witness protection program.

410
00:29:41,725 --> 00:29:43,920
-Oh, really?
-Will you calm down?

411
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:45,493
What'd you see?

412
00:29:45,662 --> 00:29:47,027
-A movie.
-A movie?!

413
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:50,359
Yes, a movie. A porno movie, that's all.
Triple-X stuff.

414
00:29:50,534 --> 00:29:54,095
Only this one starred guess who?
Hitler and a couple Nazi guys.

415
00:29:54,338 --> 00:29:56,636
You're kidding.
You saw this with your own eyes?

416
00:29:56,807 --> 00:29:59,833
We all saw it. Except this movie
has no repeat business.

417
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:03,102
-What are you talking about?
-Everybody who saw the movie is dead...

418
00:30:03,347 --> 00:30:06,009
-...except for me and Steckler.
-Steckler? Who's Steckler?

419
00:30:06,283 --> 00:30:09,480
Steckler is the Kraut who stole
the film and was trying to hawk it.

420
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:11,484
The other German guy,
the Cheshire Cat?

421
00:30:11,655 --> 00:30:14,283
Muller. He's a porno dealer
from Stuttgart.

422
00:30:14,892 --> 00:30:17,986
He's the guy who brought
Steckler over to meet us.

423
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:20,288
-Hey, Mac--
-Ellis, shush, will you?

424
00:30:20,464 --> 00:30:23,365
l'm trying to get information.
What's a film like this worth?

425
00:30:23,534 --> 00:30:26,867
Major bucks. A collector would pay
almost anything for a copy of it.

426
00:30:27,037 --> 00:30:29,631
Yeah, a bunch of dead Nazis screwing.
Yeah, l'd pay--

427
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:33,867
No, it's not just a skin flick.
There's historical stuff in it too.

428
00:30:34,144 --> 00:30:36,704
Could we get out of here?
They may be following us.

429
00:30:37,347 --> 00:30:40,009
-Mac, excuse me--
-Please, l'm trying to get information--

430
00:30:40,284 --> 00:30:43,151
-Yeah, do you mind?
-This guy Steckler, he barely knew you.

431
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,413
-Why'd he want to save you?
-You've gotta look!

432
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:04,699
Jesus.

433
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,207
-l'm glad you put on the brakes, Mac.
-Let me out.

434
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:09,845
So am l.

435
00:31:22,025 --> 00:31:24,220
Somebody want--
Must want Gutterman pretty bad.

436
00:31:24,394 --> 00:31:28,626
-We got trouble. We got trouble.
-Who are these guys?

437
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:30,423
What's that?

438
00:31:30,601 --> 00:31:35,698
l brought this from a guy at an antique
store. He swore to me it would work.

439
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:38,064
Come on, Toto.

440
00:31:38,342 --> 00:31:41,743
lf l get killed, l'm gonna go back
and kick his butt.

441
00:31:41,912 --> 00:31:43,777
Get out of the way!

442
00:31:45,148 --> 00:31:50,142
l'll get you, my little pretty. And your little
dog too. l want those ruby slippers.

443
00:31:50,354 --> 00:31:52,049
What are you doing,
playing leapfrog?

444
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,992
-Come on, put them up. Put them up.
-Get out of there, Hondo!

445
00:32:05,502 --> 00:32:07,561
Oh, my God.

446
00:32:10,741 --> 00:32:14,177
What?! You call this protection?!

447
00:32:17,114 --> 00:32:19,412
-Oh, God.
-Give me some fire! Come on!

448
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,585
-Do l have to?
-Yeah!

449
00:32:27,524 --> 00:32:30,584
-What were you doing in the street?
-Another diversionary tactic.

450
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:32,023
-Can you drive?
-Yeah.

451
00:32:32,295 --> 00:32:37,426
Drive? You're gonna follow them?
Are you guys crazy? Oh, shit.

452
00:32:40,771 --> 00:32:43,865
-Come on, Ellis.
-Your turn signal doesn't work.

453
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:45,872
Are you bullshitting me? Come on!

454
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:48,534
Don't curse when l'm driving.
lt's very distracting.

455
00:32:49,713 --> 00:32:53,672
Ellis, this is not driver's ed.
Step on the gas!

456
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,045
A courteous driver is a safe driver, Mac.

457
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:59,379
This is an authorized police pursuit,
you understand me?

458
00:32:59,556 --> 00:33:03,492
This is cops-and-robbers time. Cops
and robbers! Cops and robbers, Ellis.

459
00:33:03,727 --> 00:33:06,355
Cops and robbers!

460
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:15,335
-Oh, shit!
-Slow down!

461
00:33:15,572 --> 00:33:17,301
-What's he doing?
-l don't know.

462
00:33:17,474 --> 00:33:20,034
Mr. Sulu, set a course
for the Klingon battle fleet.

463
00:33:20,377 --> 00:33:23,039
Prepare photon torpedoes and
phasers for full engagement.

464
00:33:23,313 --> 00:33:26,749
-Mr. Scott, damage report.
-No, no, no damage report.

465
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:30,145
-You're not Capt. Kirk.
-You're right. l'm not Kirk.

466
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:33,322
-Slow down. You're gonna kill us!
-l'm Scott in engineering.

467
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:37,551
We'll never get those reactors back to
full power before we engage the enemy.

468
00:33:37,828 --> 00:33:40,228
-Oh, jeez.
-You're not Mr. Scott.

469
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:43,992
l'm Bones. Bones! The ship's medic.

470
00:33:51,208 --> 00:33:53,506
-Do something!
-What do you want me to do?

471
00:33:53,744 --> 00:33:57,771
l'm Mr. Spock. Capt. Kirk,
l relieve you of your command.

472
00:33:58,048 --> 00:34:00,846
That's what you call doing something?
Playing Mr. Spock?!

473
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:14,024
Hey! All my stuff went-- Oh, Jesus!

474
00:34:14,264 --> 00:34:15,424
Hey, bad guys!

475
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,036
Wait a minute. Oh, not my car!

476
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:26,303
Look what you're doing to my car!

477
00:34:26,476 --> 00:34:28,910
Welcome to the NASCAR
driving school.

478
00:34:29,146 --> 00:34:32,912
Anybody can learn to drive a stock car
with our patented technique of teaching.

479
00:34:38,054 --> 00:34:40,648
The wall! Look out!

480
00:34:47,264 --> 00:34:49,129
Yellow flag on the track. Yellow flag.

481
00:34:52,302 --> 00:34:55,066
No, no! Not the other side of my car!

482
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:57,330
Starting time: .2 7 1 .

483
00:35:01,678 --> 00:35:05,478
We're traveling at hyperphase velocity
to planet Kirilon.

484
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:13,282
-Mr. Sulu, warp speed.
-Warp--

485
00:35:13,456 --> 00:35:15,356
No! No! No! Not warp speed!

486
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,934
Mr. Scott, damage report.

487
00:35:30,106 --> 00:35:34,440
What's going on, captain?
l can't get any power to this reactor.

488
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:36,636
What in blue blazes happened?

489
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:39,782
The <i>Enterprise</i> is sagging
like a limp pud.

490
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:44,387
-Put your hands on that wheel, clown!
-Hi, boys. l'm Ricky Rudd.

491
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:49,321
Totalled! Ruined! The engine,
the body, even the damn ashtray!

492
00:35:49,593 --> 00:35:52,960
l put hundreds of man-hours and
thousands of dollars into that machine.

493
00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:55,324
And that's a dream that died! lt just died!

494
00:35:55,498 --> 00:35:57,329
-Take it easy, will you?
-Take it easy?

495
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,992
l just did the Firecracker 400 with
Ricky Rudd, Rusty Wallace...

496
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:03,833
...Capt. Kirk and Cmdr. Spock!

497
00:36:04,007 --> 00:36:05,872
l'm sorry, Mac. l thought he was ready.

498
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:09,034
Yeah, he's ready all right.
For a nut house someplace.

499
00:36:09,212 --> 00:36:12,648
Hey, Del, the good news is that
he qualified for a group rate.

500
00:36:12,883 --> 00:36:16,819
Goddamn it, will you shut up?! Now sit
down and listen to me, will you, please?

501
00:36:16,987 --> 00:36:18,750
You owe me that, at least.

502
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:22,423
All right. l owe you that.

503
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:25,322
This is not going to be easy.

504
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:27,156
Oh, Jesus.

505
00:36:28,265 --> 00:36:32,497
All right. All right, here it is, straight out.

506
00:36:35,372 --> 00:36:39,832
-Ellis is my nephew.
-Oh, God.

507
00:36:40,777 --> 00:36:44,873
-Yeah, l thought you'd like that one.
-Del.

508
00:36:45,348 --> 00:36:46,713
That's a good one.

509
00:36:46,883 --> 00:36:50,046
He always wanted to be a cop,
but he simply wasn't cut out for it.

510
00:36:50,387 --> 00:36:52,514
But he wouldn't let go of it.
All the time:

511
00:36:52,689 --> 00:36:58,685
''l wanna be a cop, Del. Everybody in the
family is a cop, Del. l wanna be a cop.''

512
00:36:58,862 --> 00:37:01,387
So l felt sorry for him
and gave him a break.

513
00:37:01,665 --> 00:37:04,600
So l put him in Narcotics.
Hey, he was mind-blowing, Mac.

514
00:37:04,768 --> 00:37:08,260
Kid was a natural, a goddamned genius.

515
00:37:08,738 --> 00:37:09,966
He went undercover.

516
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:15,541
Got picked up by a couple of
Colombians. You know those bastards.

517
00:37:15,712 --> 00:37:18,476
Before they're through with you,
killing you is a favor.

518
00:37:18,682 --> 00:37:23,244
They tortured that kid, Mac,
for two days solid and left him for dead.

519
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,548
You should see the scars.

520
00:37:26,723 --> 00:37:30,250
And that's when this personality-disorder
business started.

521
00:37:30,427 --> 00:37:32,156
lt was wild.

522
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:35,492
l mean, it scared the shit out of me.
He started imitating people.

523
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:38,634
Armando. Armando was the man
who tortured him.

524
00:37:38,802 --> 00:37:40,895
He acted out the whole thing.

525
00:37:41,104 --> 00:37:43,299
Then he came up with this
crazy English guy.

526
00:37:43,506 --> 00:37:45,474
Then more came out.
A cast of thousands.

527
00:37:45,642 --> 00:37:49,271
-lt was unbelievable.
-l've seen it. l've seen it.

528
00:37:49,446 --> 00:37:52,574
So he was institutionalized for a year
with the brothers.

529
00:37:52,749 --> 00:37:54,683
-The brothers?
-Benedictine monks.

530
00:37:54,851 --> 00:37:57,251
They looked after him.
They think now he's ready.

531
00:37:57,654 --> 00:37:59,087
Well, obviously he's not.

532
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:01,348
Come on, Mac.
Give the kid a break, will you?

533
00:38:01,524 --> 00:38:04,652
He can't get it together all at once.
He's gonna have a few draw--

534
00:38:04,861 --> 00:38:08,820
Don't fuck with me, Mac.
l owe that kid, and you owe me.

535
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:12,765
lf it wasn't for me, it might very well
be you up there with those brothers.

536
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,000
Well, that's true.

537
00:38:17,674 --> 00:38:21,440
So if l don't take the kid,
you're gonna give me Weskit, huh?

538
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:24,239
Have to, pal. He's the senior man.

539
00:38:26,316 --> 00:38:28,614
Your nephew?

540
00:38:28,785 --> 00:38:32,118
This guy we found in the marsh was
a agent of the German government?

541
00:38:32,288 --> 00:38:35,382
Not only that. Steckler, the guy with
the film? Guess who pays his salary?

542
00:38:35,558 --> 00:38:37,492
-Who?
-Kurt Von Metz.

543
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,651
The one running for chancellor
of Germany?

544
00:38:39,829 --> 00:38:40,887
-Same guy.
-You're kidding.

545
00:38:41,064 --> 00:38:42,964
Steckler was his personal secretary.

546
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:46,330
lnteresting, all the German connections,
huh? Fielding.

547
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:50,803
So we got a German agent,
a porno king. Now Von Metz.

548
00:38:50,974 --> 00:38:52,532
That's a load of sauerkraut.

549
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:55,473
How about me running over to the
German Embassy to look around?

550
00:38:55,645 --> 00:38:56,976
Why don't you?

551
00:38:57,147 --> 00:39:00,844
Mac. l know you don't want me
for your partner anymore.

552
00:39:01,017 --> 00:39:03,383
l don't blame you.

553
00:39:04,654 --> 00:39:07,179
By now you know l've got
this little condition...

554
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:11,316
...and one of the things that triggers it
is driving.

555
00:39:11,494 --> 00:39:13,052
Condition, huh?

556
00:39:13,229 --> 00:39:17,563
Well, l'll tell you, we're gonna have
a kind of a limited partnership.

557
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:20,768
Your Uncle Del will tell you about it.

558
00:39:20,937 --> 00:39:22,336
l'm going home.

559
00:39:22,505 --> 00:39:26,373
-You told him l was your nephew?
-He guessed.

560
00:39:27,544 --> 00:39:29,034
l don't have a home.

561
00:39:31,381 --> 00:39:33,611
You do now.

562
00:39:39,956 --> 00:39:42,618
<i>Forgive me, sir,</i>
<i>but I only want a simple yes or no.</i>

563
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:45,761
<i>Were you associated</i>
<i>with Adolf Hitler?</i>

564
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:47,556
<i>I shall answer you as I did...</i>

565
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,063
<i>...when I was nominated commander</i>
<i>of NA TO, Mr. Waslinski.</i>

566
00:39:51,234 --> 00:39:56,297
<i>I never had the displeasure</i>
<i>of even meeting Adolf Hitler.</i>

567
00:39:56,473 --> 00:39:59,601
Any guess, Mr. Von Metz,
where these rumors have come from?

568
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:05,146
Sensation mongers.
The supermarket journalists.

569
00:40:05,348 --> 00:40:08,875
Next, they will have me in a bungalow
with Marilyn Monroe.

570
00:40:09,052 --> 00:40:13,386
Or maybe l am in daily communication
with your Elvis Presley.

571
00:40:13,556 --> 00:40:16,047
-Let me now go on to ask--
-Just a moment, Mr. Waslinski.

572
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:19,057
Are your viewers aware
that l was in prison?

573
00:40:19,229 --> 00:40:22,494
Would you care to enlighten them
as to why l was there?

574
00:40:22,665 --> 00:40:25,634
Sir, you were sentenced
for participating in the September plot.

575
00:40:25,802 --> 00:40:27,667
-Which was?
-A plot to assassinate Hitler.

576
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,269
-Thank you.
-Your critics say...

577
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:32,340
...this whole assassination business
was fabricated.

578
00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:35,569
-He is here.
-Who?

579
00:40:35,745 --> 00:40:37,474
Sir, they say hard evidence exists...

580
00:40:37,647 --> 00:40:40,377
...that not only links you
to Adolf Hitler but....

581
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,083
-What are you doing here?
-You wanted to see me.

582
00:40:44,254 --> 00:40:48,520
Are you mad? Never near him. Never!
l gave you a meeting place.

583
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:52,991
lt couldn't wait until then.
See, we have a crisis.

584
00:40:53,163 --> 00:40:55,996
Steckler's disappeared.

585
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,767
All those people that you killed.
A chief of intelligence.

586
00:40:59,936 --> 00:41:05,966
We hired you to get the film back,
not to start a holocaust. lt must stop!

587
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:11,009
You lecture me, you fool.
l didn't let him steal it.

588
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:14,810
You're all morons. lncluding him.

589
00:41:14,984 --> 00:41:18,545
What goes on here, Grimmer,
is something you do not understand.

590
00:41:18,721 --> 00:41:21,212
Now find Steckler.
Tell him all will be forgiven.

591
00:41:21,424 --> 00:41:25,019
He will be reinstated.
We will match whatever offer he has.

592
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:27,561
But no more killing.

593
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:31,666
You think he will believe that?
There are only two left now.

594
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:35,201
When they are gone,
your mistakes will be corrected.

595
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:36,838
-l am telling you.
-<i>Nein</i>!

596
00:41:37,006 --> 00:41:43,343
l am telling you,
you do your job and l do mine.

597
00:41:43,513 --> 00:41:47,472
And if you ever touch me again....

598
00:42:02,398 --> 00:42:06,425
Yeah,
looks like an explosion in a dairy.

599
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:08,662
Great for graffiti, though.

600
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:12,535
l know it's kind of blank.
But it's this MPD thing.

601
00:42:12,709 --> 00:42:14,836
-MPD?
-Yeah, my condition.

602
00:42:15,011 --> 00:42:16,569
Multiple Personality Disorder.

603
00:42:16,746 --> 00:42:19,681
They say l should cut down on the
amount of stimuli l process.

604
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:22,579
-Well, you've cut down to none.
-Wanna hear a tape?

605
00:42:23,253 --> 00:42:25,551
Yeah, what do you got?

606
00:42:25,755 --> 00:42:32,251
-Earth, forest, wind, beach.
-Beach.

607
00:42:32,996 --> 00:42:34,987
Okay.

608
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:43,735
l guess you might say
l'm kind of searching for myself.

609
00:42:43,906 --> 00:42:47,467
Let me know if you ever find yourself,
kid, 'cause l'd like to meet you.

610
00:42:47,644 --> 00:42:53,105
-Have a seat.
-You know, we have a lot in common.

611
00:42:53,283 --> 00:42:59,119
Yeah. For every mood that l'm in,
you have a complete personality to fit it.

612
00:42:59,622 --> 00:43:02,819
Well, thanks for trying to understand.

613
00:43:03,626 --> 00:43:07,118
l guess l keep this apartment white
because l really don't know who l am.

614
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:10,266
lt's kind of like a blank piece of film
waiting to be exposed...

615
00:43:10,433 --> 00:43:13,561
...to what l was before my trauma
or what l've become...

616
00:43:13,736 --> 00:43:17,172
...since l was last myself
or what l hope to be again someday.

617
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:22,141
-One person, one mind.
-You sound like a bumper sticker.

618
00:43:22,779 --> 00:43:25,612
Stay as long as you want.
Got the extra room and everything.

619
00:43:25,782 --> 00:43:28,842
Yeah, l'm kind of tired.
lf you don't mind, l--

620
00:43:29,052 --> 00:43:31,077
-Sure. lt's around the corner.
-Hit the sack.

621
00:43:32,322 --> 00:43:35,621
Here's the guest room. Your room.

622
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:39,185
Sorry, l guess l could have used
a little color in here.

623
00:43:39,595 --> 00:43:42,928
There's a toothbrush, shaving stuff
and a bathrobe on the door here.

624
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:45,761
Just help yourself,
make yourself at home.

625
00:43:45,935 --> 00:43:47,926
Okay.

626
00:43:53,576 --> 00:43:55,441
-Yeah.
-Hi, it's me.

627
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:57,943
Well, l figured.

628
00:43:58,114 --> 00:44:01,208
There's no way of telling whether
l'm gonna go into an episode tonight.

629
00:44:01,384 --> 00:44:03,545
You know,
l just don't know when they occur...

630
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,881
...but when l start these personalities...

631
00:44:06,089 --> 00:44:09,024
...sometimes it's like
l'm kind of having nightmares.

632
00:44:09,192 --> 00:44:12,958
l doubt l'll do anything violent,
but lock the door, just in case.

633
00:44:13,129 --> 00:44:15,962
l can take care of myself.
l'll be out of here tomorrow.

634
00:44:16,132 --> 00:44:20,000
Well, stay as long as you want.
Sleep tight.

635
00:44:26,676 --> 00:44:30,635
Land jets! Prepare to land jets!

636
00:44:55,772 --> 00:45:00,038
Please!
Please get these rats off me now!

637
00:45:00,209 --> 00:45:05,511
You like rats? You like roaches?
You like bugs of all descriptions?

638
00:45:08,217 --> 00:45:10,515
Don't listen to him.

639
00:45:10,753 --> 00:45:13,347
We'll never go anywhere.

640
00:45:15,158 --> 00:45:17,558
Good night, everybody.

641
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:34,801
-Mac.
-Yeah, l see them, kid.

642
00:45:34,977 --> 00:45:36,774
They've been with us since your place.

643
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,740
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

644
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:42,476
What happened to your magical powers
of observation?

645
00:45:42,718 --> 00:45:44,379
You have a hard night?

646
00:45:44,554 --> 00:45:49,457
Tailing and surveillance doesn't happen
to be my area of expertise, okay?

647
00:45:50,726 --> 00:45:53,251
Did l do something strange last night?

648
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:57,126
-Do anything to disturb your sleep?
-Not a peep.

649
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:02,768
Think they're the same people
who tried to kill us yesterday?

650
00:46:02,939 --> 00:46:04,907
l don't know.

651
00:46:05,441 --> 00:46:07,341
You don't wanna live forever, do you?

652
00:46:08,444 --> 00:46:14,007
l wouldn't mind making the average
male North American life expectancy.

653
00:46:36,172 --> 00:46:38,970
l have given your message
to <i>Herr Doberman</i> myself.

654
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:43,840
Someone will be with you presently.
lf you will please wait here.

655
00:46:44,013 --> 00:46:46,038
Here?

656
00:46:46,382 --> 00:46:49,442
Yes, sir. Right here.

657
00:46:51,454 --> 00:46:53,649
Right here?

658
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:57,257
Yes, sir. Right there.

659
00:46:57,793 --> 00:46:59,522
Thank you.

660
00:46:59,695 --> 00:47:03,756
Must be the magic oval. l guess
we're safe in here or something.

661
00:47:03,966 --> 00:47:05,831
Detective Stern.

662
00:47:06,002 --> 00:47:09,335
Bob Smiley,
assistant deputy director of the FBl.

663
00:47:09,505 --> 00:47:11,837
You've heard of us.

664
00:47:12,275 --> 00:47:14,971
Just kidding, Mac. Call me Bob.

665
00:47:15,144 --> 00:47:17,635
-lt is Mac, right?
-MacArthur Stern.

666
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:19,804
Right. Look, Mac...

667
00:47:20,816 --> 00:47:24,308
...let's get off on the right foot here.

668
00:47:24,554 --> 00:47:26,988
Just kidding, Mac.
l like to keep things loose.

669
00:47:27,156 --> 00:47:30,148
-Who's this?
-This is Mr. Fielding.

670
00:47:30,326 --> 00:47:34,057
How are you? Sorry,
my dossier didn't list your partner.

671
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,892
Well, he's not my partner.
He's my tailor.

672
00:47:37,066 --> 00:47:39,057
What?

673
00:47:39,669 --> 00:47:42,103
Just kidding, Bob.

674
00:47:42,338 --> 00:47:44,670
That's funny. Look, Mac--

675
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,742
Listen, l came down here to meet with
an official of the German government.

676
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:51,175
Now, why am l speaking
to the FBl agent?

677
00:47:51,347 --> 00:47:56,341
-Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac.
-Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob. What?

678
00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:00,853
So tell me, Mac,
are you onto something? ls that it?

679
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:04,925
-Could be.
-Wouldn't be good not to tell me.

680
00:48:05,094 --> 00:48:07,858
-l suppose not.
-As one professional to another...

681
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:10,362
...l've got to tell you,
we've got a thorny problem.

682
00:48:10,533 --> 00:48:13,627
-What's that, Bob?
-Well, we're extremely sensitive...

683
00:48:13,836 --> 00:48:16,532
...to the great job you boys are doing
down in the trenches.

684
00:48:17,373 --> 00:48:19,534
l started on the bottom rung.
Did you know that?

685
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:21,904
-l didn't know that, Bob.
-Yes, indeedy.

686
00:48:22,078 --> 00:48:25,104
Two years, Homicide, Tacoma P.D.

687
00:48:25,281 --> 00:48:26,805
-l'll be darned.
-Yeah.

688
00:48:26,983 --> 00:48:28,644
So, Mac, l want you to know...

689
00:48:28,851 --> 00:48:32,912
...that we're aware that you have
a multiple homicide case to resolve...

690
00:48:33,089 --> 00:48:35,922
...and God knows that's an important
public responsibility...

691
00:48:36,092 --> 00:48:38,925
...and we're gonna open every bit of this
up to you lads...

692
00:48:39,095 --> 00:48:44,089
...just as soon as National Security
priorities are satisfied.

693
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:47,268
l think that sounds square.

694
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:52,098
-What do you think, Mac?
-l think that sounds pretty shitty, Bob.

695
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:56,001
Well, l can understand that
from your perspective, Mac.

696
00:48:56,178 --> 00:49:00,842
l'd probably feel that way too
if l were in your shoes, but l'm not.

697
00:49:01,017 --> 00:49:04,612
-l'm in these shoes.
-Thom McCann's, 1 1 1 <i>l</i>2E.

698
00:49:04,787 --> 00:49:07,312
And these shoes walked a lot
of hard miles.

699
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:12,120
These shoes have carried some heavy
loads, in terms of this nation's security.

700
00:49:12,294 --> 00:49:14,285
What do you say to that, Mac?

701
00:49:14,463 --> 00:49:19,298
l think those shoes are carrying
the biggest load l've ever seen, Bob.

702
00:49:20,102 --> 00:49:24,698
Well, l can see we got off
to the wrong foot after all.

703
00:49:24,907 --> 00:49:28,434
l've got a writ being drafted,
giving me custody of Mr. Gutterman.

704
00:49:28,611 --> 00:49:31,705
l'll be down for him in about an hour.

705
00:49:32,148 --> 00:49:34,946
You boys have a nice day.

706
00:49:36,786 --> 00:49:41,052
-Mac, can l say something?
-Yeah, Ellis, what is it?

707
00:49:41,223 --> 00:49:45,216
-What a fucking putz.
-Why, Ellis.

708
00:49:45,428 --> 00:49:49,330
Well, l mean, he's a classic
anal-retentive reprobate.

709
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:51,659
''Anal-retentive.''

710
00:49:51,834 --> 00:49:54,394
-lt's got a nice ring to it.
-lt's psychology.

711
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:57,300
l like ''fucking putz'' better.

712
00:50:10,953 --> 00:50:12,511
We're gonna have to move Gutterman.

713
00:50:12,688 --> 00:50:15,350
He's not gonna get along
with our Mr. Smiley in there.

714
00:50:15,524 --> 00:50:18,220
-Can we do that?
-Yeah, if we get a forklift.

715
00:50:19,762 --> 00:50:24,256
They're still here.
Wonder what her story is.

716
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:28,301
Based upon first observations, subject
to revision with further data of course...

717
00:50:28,471 --> 00:50:32,202
...l'd say she's about 5'7'',
1 1 7 pounds.

718
00:50:32,408 --> 00:50:35,070
DlA, ClA or NSA operative.

719
00:50:35,244 --> 00:50:37,474
Recruited out of Bennington College,
Vermont.

720
00:50:37,747 --> 00:50:39,772
Born in Richmond, Virginia.

721
00:50:39,982 --> 00:50:44,385
Turn-ons: Fellini films and men
with hairy chests who read Chaucer.

722
00:50:44,553 --> 00:50:48,250
Turnoffs: macho men
who aren't for world peace.

723
00:50:48,424 --> 00:50:51,951
-Also has a cat named Bootsie.
-What?

724
00:50:52,128 --> 00:50:54,688
Just kidding.
How the heck would l know who she is?

725
00:50:54,864 --> 00:50:57,799
Ellis, Ellis, Ellis.

726
00:51:05,941 --> 00:51:09,035
Now, come on, Harry. You know
Steckler wouldn't risk his life...

727
00:51:09,211 --> 00:51:11,441
...helping you over that fence
for nothing.

728
00:51:11,614 --> 00:51:13,775
Come on, you can tell us.
You were the buyer.

729
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:16,144
l don't want to have anything
to do with it.

730
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,778
And you guys can't make me do it!
l want my lawyer!

731
00:51:20,956 --> 00:51:22,583
Okay, fine.

732
00:51:22,758 --> 00:51:24,726
We don't need Mr. Gutterman anymore,
do we?

733
00:51:24,894 --> 00:51:26,691
-Let's cut him loose, shall we?
-Loose?

734
00:51:26,862 --> 00:51:29,330
Wait, you can't do that.
l'll be dead before dinner.

735
00:51:29,532 --> 00:51:31,796
Based upon current trends,
l'd say that's a good bet.

736
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,457
-l think so, yeah.
-Okay!

737
00:51:33,636 --> 00:51:36,730
You guys want me to confess,
l'll confess. All right, l did it.

738
00:51:36,906 --> 00:51:40,398
-l'll show you where the bodies are.
-Gutterman, forget it.

739
00:51:40,576 --> 00:51:43,340
-We're gonna cut you loose.
-Bullshit.

740
00:51:43,546 --> 00:51:44,843
-Oh, yeah?
-You're bluffing.

741
00:51:45,047 --> 00:51:47,072
-Just try me. Just try me.
-You're bluffing.

742
00:51:47,483 --> 00:51:49,974
Mr. Gutterman's innocent.
We're gonna cut him loose.

743
00:51:50,152 --> 00:51:51,949
-Will you process him?
-Visit anytime.

744
00:51:52,121 --> 00:51:54,112
-Process me, Rachel.
-You sure about this?

745
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,520
-Yeah, l'm sure.
-He's innocent?

746
00:51:56,692 --> 00:51:58,660
Yeah, he's innocent.

747
00:51:59,128 --> 00:52:01,790
Rick? Detective Fielding.

748
00:52:01,964 --> 00:52:03,864
From the Wagner case,
couple of years ago.

749
00:52:04,166 --> 00:52:08,466
l just wanted to repay the little help that
you gave us on that with a news tip.

750
00:52:09,305 --> 00:52:13,503
Well, we've been holding Harry ''The
Hippo'' Gutterman as a material witness.

751
00:52:13,676 --> 00:52:15,871
Yeah, Mr. Triple-X himself. Yeah.

752
00:52:16,078 --> 00:52:19,275
Trouble is, we can't hold him anymore.
We gotta let him go.

753
00:52:19,481 --> 00:52:22,712
We're cutting him loose. Wondered
if you want to come ask him questions.

754
00:52:23,185 --> 00:52:26,643
You would? Well, great. How fast
could you have a video crew here?

755
00:52:27,489 --> 00:52:30,151
Oh, terrific. So he would make
the noon report, huh?

756
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:35,126
You're gonna have a terrific interview
with this guy. He's quite a character.

757
00:52:35,297 --> 00:52:37,094
-Okay.
-That's not funny.

758
00:52:37,299 --> 00:52:40,029
-Now you're catching on.
-You're signing my death warrant!

759
00:52:40,202 --> 00:52:42,466
Harry, don't use clichs, all right?

760
00:52:42,638 --> 00:52:45,163
We have no respect for you
if you use clichs.

761
00:52:45,341 --> 00:52:47,832
-But this is like a nightmare.
-Another clich.

762
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,910
Get newspapers involved.
lt's a big story.

763
00:52:50,112 --> 00:52:52,171
-Why not the networks?
-<i>National Enquirer.</i>

764
00:52:52,348 --> 00:52:55,442
-All right, what do you want?
-When do you meet Steckler...

765
00:52:55,618 --> 00:52:57,176
-...to buy this film?
-Tomorrow.

766
00:52:57,353 --> 00:52:59,184
-Where?
-l own a bathhouse in New York.

767
00:52:59,355 --> 00:53:01,721
-Let's go.
-No, go. You go. You don't need me.

768
00:53:01,891 --> 00:53:03,882
We don't know what Steckler looks like.

769
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:10,157
l don't wanna go with him. He's crazy.
And l have my doubts about you.

770
00:53:10,332 --> 00:53:12,095
-<i>Washington Post.</i>
-Reuters lnternational.

771
00:53:12,268 --> 00:53:14,429
-TASS. <i>Pravda.</i>
-CNN. MTV.

772
00:53:14,637 --> 00:53:17,902
-<i>New York Times.</i>
-l am not going!

773
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,238
l swear to God, if l get killed,
l'm gonna sue you guys.

774
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:22,741
-Uh-oh.
-What?

775
00:53:22,912 --> 00:53:25,005
Someone we'd rather not see right now.

776
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:27,671
Oh, jeez.

777
00:53:29,518 --> 00:53:31,782
-So who we running from?
-Bad men, Harry.

778
00:53:31,954 --> 00:53:34,616
Chasing us to a police station.
These are really bad guys.

779
00:53:34,790 --> 00:53:36,690
-Come on, move it.
-l want protection.

780
00:53:36,859 --> 00:53:39,293
-You'll get protection.
-Oh, like l had yesterday?

781
00:53:39,461 --> 00:53:43,921
-You're not dead. That's protection.
-You're just lucky, that's all.

782
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:48,364
-Come on, Harry. Put it in high gear.
-l got one gear. This is it.

783
00:53:48,537 --> 00:53:50,767
-Who we running from?
-We're taking the van.

784
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,168
Hey!

785
00:53:52,374 --> 00:53:55,537
-l'll drive.
-No!

786
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,214
-Let's go.
-Just a second.

787
00:54:00,382 --> 00:54:02,612
l'd like to bring my right leg with me,
you mind?

788
00:54:02,785 --> 00:54:04,878
Let's go! Come on!

789
00:54:07,423 --> 00:54:10,187
Hey, you gotta sign for that.

790
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:13,458
Who the hell are they?

791
00:54:13,629 --> 00:54:15,995
What the fuck you think this is? Hertz?

792
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:19,127
We can't take a chance on the road.
We'll catch a train.

793
00:54:25,507 --> 00:54:28,738
-You guys all right?
-Yeah, yeah! Lose them! Lose them!

794
00:54:36,218 --> 00:54:38,152
Hold on.

795
00:54:39,488 --> 00:54:41,353
Where the hell you think we're going?

796
00:54:53,535 --> 00:54:55,127
Let's see what you got, cowboy.

797
00:55:29,638 --> 00:55:32,232
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-My God! l'm so sorry.

798
00:55:32,408 --> 00:55:35,104
-Where'd you learn to drive?
-l didn't see you.

799
00:55:35,277 --> 00:55:39,646
-Hold on!
-To what? No!

800
00:55:40,582 --> 00:55:43,847
-Get this car out of here!
-Get into that car and get out of here!

801
00:55:44,053 --> 00:55:47,716
-Get! l don't care! Get out of here!
-l can hear you. Stop yelling!

802
00:55:47,923 --> 00:55:52,917
Wait! You're gonna wreck the car!
What are you doing? No! Oh, no!

803
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:03,234
-Thom McCann's, 1 1 E.
-l'm dead.

804
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:07,205
-Calm down. Put him on the train, okay?
-All aboard!

805
00:56:09,945 --> 00:56:13,039
You have got to be the dumbest jerk
l've ever met.

806
00:56:13,215 --> 00:56:17,276
Bob, you brought my application
for the FBl. Oh, thanks.

807
00:56:17,453 --> 00:56:19,444
Cut the crap.
That's a writ giving me custody...

808
00:56:19,621 --> 00:56:21,452
...of the prisoner, Harry Gutterman.

809
00:56:21,623 --> 00:56:25,855
Ace, hold it. Bob, you got a writ.

810
00:56:26,028 --> 00:56:28,462
l got a writ. My writ is better
than your writ.

811
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:30,721
Are you crazy?
This document means nothing.

812
00:56:30,899 --> 00:56:34,699
You better back off quick, or l'll have
your nuts in a Cuisinart. You got that?

813
00:56:34,903 --> 00:56:38,202
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, you know
anything about mathematics?

814
00:56:38,407 --> 00:56:40,034
Multiplication, subtraction?

815
00:56:40,209 --> 00:56:41,904
Yeah, yeah, yeah, l understand math.

816
00:56:42,077 --> 00:56:44,068
What's this add up to, Bob?

817
00:56:50,352 --> 00:56:51,979
You are crazy.

818
00:56:52,154 --> 00:56:57,114
l'll see you in court. ln the meantime,
stay out of my way.

819
00:56:57,292 --> 00:57:00,853
l'll see you in New York. You just
screwed with the wrong man, boyo.

820
00:57:01,597 --> 00:57:03,997
Get us some tickets.

821
00:57:21,517 --> 00:57:24,975
Hey, that looks like Bob Smiley
from the FBl.

822
00:57:25,154 --> 00:57:30,285
Hey! Yeah. Hi, Bob. How you doing?

823
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:41,469
Hey, you know this train goes
to Cleveland, Mac?

824
00:57:41,637 --> 00:57:45,300
l know. We'll catch a plane back
to Philly and drive the rest of the way.

825
00:57:45,474 --> 00:57:46,498
Cleveland?

826
00:57:46,708 --> 00:57:49,370
l hope you noticed l've been
pretty even and clear, huh?

827
00:57:49,545 --> 00:57:51,775
-Yeah.
-No episodes, no problems.

828
00:57:51,947 --> 00:57:54,609
Everything under control.
l'm kind of proud of myself.

829
00:57:54,783 --> 00:57:58,412
Can somebody tell me
what the hell's going on here?

830
00:58:01,957 --> 00:58:04,824
Hold it, sweetheart.
Ellis, cover that dude.

831
00:58:04,993 --> 00:58:07,962
Assume the position, come on.
Up, up, up.

832
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:11,065
This is the position you meant, right?
l watch American TV.

833
00:58:11,233 --> 00:58:13,030
At least you didn't say, ''Spread them.''

834
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:14,692
l didn't see that episode.

835
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:17,930
lD's in my purse.

836
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,671
Rebecca Lowengrin.

837
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:22,742
Call me Riva.

838
00:58:22,945 --> 00:58:27,644
''Attach lsraeli Embassy.''
Attach spelled Mossad?

839
00:58:27,816 --> 00:58:29,750
-Mossad?
-lsraeli secret service.

840
00:58:29,952 --> 00:58:33,388
Oh, that's my people. l'd like to apply
for political asylum right now.

841
00:58:33,555 --> 00:58:35,750
Simmer down, Gutterman.
What about these dudes?

842
00:58:35,958 --> 00:58:38,483
They don't look like they're going
to a Tupperware party.

843
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,491
Can we talk someplace
less conspicuous?

844
00:58:40,662 --> 00:58:43,893
-How about the dining car?
-We have a room with a view.

845
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:46,534
lt's a very small room.

846
00:58:47,836 --> 00:58:51,101
How much do you know about all this?

847
00:58:51,273 --> 00:58:55,073
Just that Hitler was a very naughty boy
and that Von Metz was his buddy.

848
00:58:55,244 --> 00:58:58,839
Exactly, and now in four days, this man
is gonna be chancellor of Germany.

849
00:58:59,014 --> 00:59:01,346
Unless you get to that film.

850
00:59:01,516 --> 00:59:04,007
Let me understand.
Von Metz and Steckler were close.

851
00:59:04,186 --> 00:59:06,552
Political opponents of Von Metz
bribed Steckler...

852
00:59:06,722 --> 00:59:09,452
...to see if they could find something
to use against him.

853
00:59:09,625 --> 00:59:12,389
Steckler found the film,
saw it was of such great value...

854
00:59:12,561 --> 00:59:17,191
...decided to double-cross everybody
and sell it to Harry Gutterman.

855
00:59:17,366 --> 00:59:19,561
Von Metz killed everybody
who'd seen it?

856
00:59:19,735 --> 00:59:22,704
Not Von Metz directly. There's
a mercenary named Joseph Grimmer.

857
00:59:22,871 --> 00:59:27,069
He's a neo-Nazi fanatic, a psychotic. He
makes Noriega look like Mother Teresa.

858
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:29,501
Von Metz's people
have lost control of him.

859
00:59:29,678 --> 00:59:32,408
-The rocket man.
-Yeah. We've met him.

860
00:59:32,581 --> 00:59:34,446
So you want us to give you the film?

861
00:59:34,883 --> 00:59:37,078
We believe Von Metz was
a favorite of Hitler's.

862
00:59:37,252 --> 00:59:40,551
He may have been the one chosen
to help Hitler commit suicide.

863
00:59:42,257 --> 00:59:44,088
l gotta think about this.

864
00:59:44,259 --> 00:59:45,624
Well, do l get a vote?

865
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:48,262
Yeah, but in case of a tie, l win.

866
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:52,628
l know if l'm even partially responsible
for letting a guy like Von Metz go...

867
00:59:52,801 --> 00:59:55,395
...l'll have more nightmares.

868
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:56,798
Me.

869
00:59:56,972 --> 01:00:00,908
<i>Et tu,</i> Harry? Since when did
you get so civic-minded?

870
01:00:01,109 --> 01:00:03,475
l know. l know you think
l'm a sleazebag, right?

871
01:00:03,645 --> 01:00:08,241
Maybe l am. Maybe l am a sleazebag.
Maybe all my life l've been a sleazebag.

872
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:12,242
Somebody had to be the sleazebag.
lf it wasn't me, maybe it'd have been you.

873
01:00:12,454 --> 01:00:15,252
So maybe you should thank me.
Did you ever think of that?

874
01:00:15,957 --> 01:00:20,087
l never thought about it like that.
But now that you put it that way...

875
01:00:20,262 --> 01:00:22,253
...thanks for being a sleazebag for me.

876
01:00:22,464 --> 01:00:25,160
My pleasure.

877
01:00:25,334 --> 01:00:29,430
Anyway, l say nail this Von Metz
because he is a real sleazebag.

878
01:00:29,604 --> 01:00:32,437
Do you know what l mean?

879
01:00:52,527 --> 01:00:56,691
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!

880
01:00:57,666 --> 01:01:01,466
Shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

881
01:01:27,062 --> 01:01:29,496
That bastard's trying
to take over the train.

882
01:01:36,938 --> 01:01:38,371
He has taken over the train.

883
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:41,065
They need Gutterman alive.
That gives us an advantage.

884
01:01:41,243 --> 01:01:42,835
l'll hold them. You go to the back.

885
01:01:43,011 --> 01:01:45,445
-Ellis, l need your help!
-Who are they, Sundance?

886
01:01:45,647 --> 01:01:50,346
Next time l say let's go someplace like
Bolivia, let's go someplace like Bolivia!

887
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:52,578
-Who's he doing now?
-l don't know.

888
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,355
-Halt!
-No, no, no.

889
01:02:00,529 --> 01:02:03,054
Not until Harvey and l get the
rules straightened out.

890
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:04,926
-<i>Butch Cassidy and the</i>--
-<i>Sundance Kid.</i>

891
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:06,794
Harvey? Rules?

892
01:02:11,573 --> 01:02:14,770
Halt! Halt!

893
01:02:17,712 --> 01:02:18,770
Halt! Halt!

894
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,912
Road Runner?

895
01:02:26,087 --> 01:02:27,952
Hey, it's working.

896
01:02:29,991 --> 01:02:32,255
Let's move!

897
01:02:37,466 --> 01:02:39,434
Road Runner! Road Runner!
Up the stairs!

898
01:02:39,601 --> 01:02:42,434
Get Gutterman. Come on! Come on!

899
01:02:45,774 --> 01:02:47,901
-Who are they?
-l've been asking that all day!

900
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:50,337
We can fight or they'll
starve us, Sundance.

901
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:51,603
What?

902
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:54,146
They might surrender,
but l wouldn't count on it.

903
01:02:54,649 --> 01:02:56,708
-We'll fight!
-No, we'll jump!

904
01:02:57,586 --> 01:02:59,281
-Are you crazy?
-Do you want to die?

905
01:02:59,454 --> 01:03:00,819
-l can't swim!
-We gotta jump!

906
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:03,014
Are you nuts?
You couldn't possibly sink.

907
01:03:10,732 --> 01:03:14,259
Harry! Harry!

908
01:03:17,272 --> 01:03:20,366
<i>I'm Popeye the Sailor Man</i>

909
01:03:23,044 --> 01:03:27,640
<i>The Love Boat</i>
<i>Soon we'll be taking another cruise</i>

910
01:03:35,857 --> 01:03:39,156
<i>Rollin', rollin' on the river</i>

911
01:04:15,163 --> 01:04:18,496
Chopper's coming. Come on, let's go!

912
01:04:23,905 --> 01:04:27,033
Get down! Get down!

913
01:04:33,048 --> 01:04:35,073
They're coming back.

914
01:04:54,235 --> 01:04:56,863
They're leaving.

915
01:05:02,577 --> 01:05:05,944
We'll be lucky if he doesn't have
a bloodhound on that helicopter.

916
01:05:06,114 --> 01:05:08,742
What do we do now?

917
01:05:09,784 --> 01:05:15,552
They can't hang around too long. That
hijacking will attract a lot of attention.

918
01:05:15,724 --> 01:05:18,158
We'll just wait here until dark.

919
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,761
There's a little town
a couple miles back.

920
01:05:22,497 --> 01:05:24,624
Ellis, are you all right?

921
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:28,633
l'm sorry, Mac. l'm sorry.

922
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:57,621
Let's go, Harry.

923
01:05:59,634 --> 01:06:02,967
lt's getting late.
Let's get ready to go, kid.

924
01:06:03,471 --> 01:06:06,304
l can't make it, Mac.

925
01:06:08,677 --> 01:06:11,771
What? What are you talking about?

926
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:16,349
The whole thing. l just-- l feel like
l'm collapsing in on myself.

927
01:06:16,518 --> 01:06:19,681
l feel like the next time l go to split,
l-- l'm gonna go...

928
01:06:19,854 --> 01:06:23,346
...and l'm not gonna make it back,
and there's gonna be no Ellis anymore.

929
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:28,622
So you gotta take me
back to the brothers.

930
01:06:30,298 --> 01:06:33,233
Listen, l'm gonna say
something to you...

931
01:06:33,435 --> 01:06:36,700
...that l have never ever said
to anybody in my life, ever.

932
01:06:37,238 --> 01:06:38,296
What's that?

933
01:06:38,473 --> 01:06:41,135
l need your help.

934
01:06:41,843 --> 01:06:43,310
Yeah, l need your help.

935
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:47,204
You know, l've always had
this kind of noble view of myself.

936
01:06:47,382 --> 01:06:50,840
That l'm this Mr. Straight Arrow
living in a crooked world.

937
01:06:51,019 --> 01:06:54,819
lf you don't like my merry-go-round,
get off and get your own wooden horse.

938
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:59,593
And then you came along, and
l saw you out there battling against...

939
01:06:59,761 --> 01:07:02,423
...enemies that you couldn't even see.

940
01:07:02,597 --> 01:07:05,225
l said to myself, ''l gotta help this guy.''

941
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:10,337
l mean, ''l need to help this guy.''

942
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:14,741
So you can't go back to the monastery.
You got that straight?

943
01:07:14,909 --> 01:07:16,706
Sure, Mac.

944
01:07:19,514 --> 01:07:22,506
You know the poet Dylan Thomas?

945
01:07:24,285 --> 01:07:27,049
l've read a couple sonnets.

946
01:07:27,222 --> 01:07:30,419
My favorite line of poetry:

947
01:07:30,992 --> 01:07:37,727
<i>Do not go gentle into that good night</i>
<i>Rage, rage against the dying of the light</i>

948
01:07:38,366 --> 01:07:40,391
That's what you're doing, kid.

949
01:07:40,568 --> 01:07:45,198
You've seen the light flickering, and
you're afraid it's gonna go out. And it is.

950
01:07:45,373 --> 01:07:49,241
lt is gonna go out.
And that should piss you off.

951
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:52,971
You gotta get your rage back. You gotta
fight. You know what l'm saying?

952
01:07:53,148 --> 01:07:56,276
Scare those dark, ugly buggers
just right back into the night.

953
01:07:56,918 --> 01:07:59,785
Throw your head back and howl,
you know? Try it, come on.

954
01:07:59,954 --> 01:08:01,444
Throw your head back and howl.

955
01:08:08,029 --> 01:08:12,261
Come on, try it. Come on.

956
01:08:13,101 --> 01:08:17,094
Come on, that's a puppy yelp. Come on.
Throw your head back and howl.

957
01:08:18,273 --> 01:08:20,798
Come on.

958
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:28,181
That's it. Come on.

959
01:08:34,756 --> 01:08:37,919
Doesn't that feel good?

960
01:08:39,994 --> 01:08:45,830
Now it's both of them. Oh, shit.

961
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:10,348
Pretty snazzy, Harry.

962
01:09:12,527 --> 01:09:15,360
-You gone legit?
-l got a lot of legitimate interests.

963
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:16,827
ls this joint in your name?

964
01:09:16,998 --> 01:09:20,297
lt's a corporation. l'm the president.

965
01:09:20,468 --> 01:09:24,097
Then Grimmer and his storm troopers
will find it, if they haven't already.

966
01:09:24,706 --> 01:09:25,798
Mac.

967
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:30,978
-Do we give the film to the lsraelis?
-Yes.

968
01:09:32,647 --> 01:09:36,413
l don't know where the lsraelis are,
and l don't have time to find them.

969
01:09:36,618 --> 01:09:38,643
She knows where we are.

970
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,754
You told her?

971
01:09:41,122 --> 01:09:42,487
You shouldn't have done that.

972
01:09:42,657 --> 01:09:45,751
Mac, the lsraelis are gonna
make sure the world...

973
01:09:45,994 --> 01:09:48,258
...sees this film tonight.

974
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:51,662
What are you talking about?

975
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:55,599
Von Metz is speaking to the lnternational
Conference of Christians and Jews.

976
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:58,432
The lsraelis will project the film
during his speech.

977
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,336
All right!

978
01:10:02,377 --> 01:10:05,403
Harry, is there a back way in this joint?

979
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,048
Are you kidding?

980
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:12,614
-Yeah. Okay.
-ls this a secret passage?

981
01:10:12,787 --> 01:10:16,450
lt comes in very handy with jealous
husbands, business partners, et cetera.

982
01:10:16,658 --> 01:10:20,219
Get on your intercom, find out if any
large groups have come through today.

983
01:10:20,395 --> 01:10:22,886
Max. Maxie?

984
01:10:23,298 --> 01:10:26,392
Where the hell are you, Max?

985
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:28,762
Max!

986
01:10:28,937 --> 01:10:30,268
A two-way mirror, huh?

987
01:10:30,438 --> 01:10:31,905
Yeah, yeah, two-way mirror.

988
01:10:32,073 --> 01:10:33,597
-<i>Hello?</i>
-Max, it's me.

989
01:10:33,808 --> 01:10:36,106
Any large groups of people
come through today?

990
01:10:36,277 --> 01:10:39,303
<i>Just singles and couples.</i>
<i>Lots of business for this time of day.</i>

991
01:10:39,781 --> 01:10:42,648
-Anybody speaking German?
-Anybody talking German?

992
01:10:42,817 --> 01:10:45,445
<i>No, sir, no Germans.</i>
<i>What's going on, Mr. Gutterman?</i>

993
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:46,985
Nothing. Thank you.

994
01:10:47,288 --> 01:10:50,086
Let's take a look around.
Harry, you got a gun l can use?

995
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:54,091
Oh, be my guest.

996
01:10:54,595 --> 01:10:57,564
-Wow!
-All sizes, all shapes, all models.

997
01:10:57,732 --> 01:10:59,131
Every health spa so equipped?

998
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,427
We got a lot of competition
in this business.

999
01:11:01,602 --> 01:11:02,899
Can you handle this?

1000
01:11:03,071 --> 01:11:05,835
l can handle it.

1001
01:11:08,142 --> 01:11:09,973
lf you change, make it into Rambo.

1002
01:11:10,144 --> 01:11:12,237
Yo.

1003
01:11:20,455 --> 01:11:22,252
lt looks harmless enough.

1004
01:11:22,423 --> 01:11:25,017
On the surface.

1005
01:11:30,798 --> 01:11:32,356
ls that a steam room over there?

1006
01:11:32,533 --> 01:11:34,763
Check it.

1007
01:11:46,748 --> 01:11:49,273
Why don't you grab a towel
and join us?

1008
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:52,044
l'm trying to quit.

1009
01:12:08,002 --> 01:12:11,529
Don't be cute. l speak pig Latin.

1010
01:12:12,807 --> 01:12:15,207
Pig Latin.

1011
01:12:20,648 --> 01:12:23,344
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

1012
01:12:31,559 --> 01:12:32,651
Steckler!

1013
01:12:46,107 --> 01:12:47,540
-All right, Harry!
-Go, Harry!

1014
01:12:48,176 --> 01:12:50,542
They're fucking
with the wrong Jew this time!

1015
01:12:52,747 --> 01:12:54,578
Steckler! Get Steckler!

1016
01:12:54,816 --> 01:12:56,215
Get Steckler out of here!

1017
01:12:56,384 --> 01:12:59,842
-What are you gonna do?
-l'll cover you.

1018
01:13:13,601 --> 01:13:16,764
Come on! My gun's jammed!

1019
01:13:16,938 --> 01:13:18,269
Ellis, cover me!

1020
01:13:26,614 --> 01:13:29,583
-Hey!
-At Grand Central Station in a locker.

1021
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:31,047
What?

1022
01:13:34,455 --> 01:13:37,219
Hunky-dory, yeah? Up, <i>Liebling.</i>

1023
01:13:37,391 --> 01:13:39,882
Grimmer!

1024

Hold your fire! We have
your collaborators.

Out the door now! Now out!

1028

Or we kill everybody! Now!

1029
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:06,843
He told you, yeah?

1030
01:14:07,021 --> 01:14:08,682
Only God hears him now. He's dead.

1031
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:11,415
Now! Tell me now! l have no time!

1032
01:14:11,592 --> 01:14:12,752

You leave me no choice.

You understand German! Tell me,
where is it? Tell me!

1035

-Where is it?
-l'll take you to it.

1036
01:14:34,815 --> 01:14:38,307
Grand Central! We're going
to Grand Central Station.

1037
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,925
Damn it!

1038
01:15:13,521 --> 01:15:15,216
-Get me a blanket.
-You got it.

1039
01:15:15,389 --> 01:15:18,654
No blanket. Get a pliers.

1040
01:16:10,745 --> 01:16:12,872
You need tokens. Got any tokens, Mac?

1041
01:16:13,047 --> 01:16:16,278
-l don't-- l don't have any of them.
-We need some, though.

1042
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:18,816
-l could get them for you.
-Why don't we do that.

1043
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,388
What's the matter?

1044
01:16:27,561 --> 01:16:30,291
lt's the ceiling. lt's closing in.
l feel a little--

1045

You're a good cop. You're gonna

Ellis! Ellis!

1054

Police officer. Let me through, please.
Let me through. Police officer!

1055
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,775
Police officer. Back this train up!

1056
01:17:20,948 --> 01:17:23,143
-Are you crazy? l can't back up.
-Back up!

1057
01:17:23,317 --> 01:17:25,512
-Subway, no reverse.
-Damn!

1058
01:17:30,391 --> 01:17:32,552
This one of your regular haunts,
Grimmer?

Hey! Hey! Hey, what the hell you doing?

You like this stuff, huh? This is fun

Hey! What do you guys want--?

Police! Don't move! Drop it! Drop it!

1072

Cuff him, come on! Get the other guy!

01:19:50,631 --> 01:19:51,723
Hold it!

1074
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:02,334
Sorry, but time for politeness is over.

1075
01:20:37,778 --> 01:20:41,077
Thank you for the information.
You've been a very entertaining fellow.

1076
01:21:01,669 --> 01:21:03,159
Come!

1077
01:21:04,505 --> 01:21:07,668
l told them the film was
in Workers Area B...

1078
01:21:07,841 --> 01:21:10,776
...in some guy named
Greisendorfer's locker.

1079
01:21:10,945 --> 01:21:12,742
Yeah.

1080
01:21:12,913 --> 01:21:16,178
There's no guy named Greisendorfer.

1081
01:21:17,084 --> 01:21:19,518
You did good, kid. You did good.

1082
01:21:21,055 --> 01:21:23,922
-Steckler said it was in locker 64.
-Sixty-four.

1083
01:21:24,091 --> 01:21:25,251
-Workers Area B.
-Okay.

1084
01:21:25,426 --> 01:21:26,620
Locker 64.

1085
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:29,556
You scared that ugly bugger
back into the night.

1086
01:21:30,364 --> 01:21:33,629
-He heard me howling, huh?
-He heard you howling.

1087
01:21:36,403 --> 01:21:39,566
-Go get them.
-Hold on. Hold on just a couple minutes.

1088
01:21:39,740 --> 01:21:42,868
l'll be fine. Go get it!

1089
01:21:44,845 --> 01:21:45,903

-l'm a police officer.
-Now!

Nobody move.

1096
01:23:48,202 --> 01:23:50,033
All right, hold it, Cookie Monster.

1097
01:23:51,505 --> 01:23:53,234
Come down, pussycat.

1098
01:23:53,407 --> 01:23:56,069
Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.

1099
01:23:56,744 --> 01:24:00,202
Get down. Down the ladder!

1100
01:24:00,914 --> 01:24:02,711
Give me my film.

1101
01:24:02,883 --> 01:24:04,475
Easy, give me the film.

1102

Oh, no, Mr. Bill. l'm cuckoo
for Cocoa Puffs.

1105
01:24:18,432 --> 01:24:21,799
Lucy, l'm home. Well, isn't that special?

1106
01:24:22,002 --> 01:24:24,800
-lt's comic relief, huh?
-Well, excuse me!

1107
01:24:27,074 --> 01:24:31,602
Guess what? Humpty Dumpty took
the great fall, huh?

1108
01:24:31,779 --> 01:24:34,077
That's my name. Don't wear it out.

1109
01:24:34,515 --> 01:24:36,039
Give me the fucking film.

1110
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:39,947
-Shoot him, Ellis.
-Oh, yeah, right.

1111
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:44,147
l can't, Mac. l don't have a gun.

1112
01:24:45,559 --> 01:24:47,550
You didn't have to say that, did you?

1113
01:24:47,728 --> 01:24:49,286
On the other hand, he's crazy.

1114
01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:52,324
He could be fibbing
about not having a gun.

1115
01:24:52,533 --> 01:24:55,127
Yeah, could be.

1116
01:24:55,569 --> 01:24:58,402
What do you think a .45 automatic
would do to him from here?

1117
01:24:58,572 --> 01:25:01,803
Put a pretty good hole in him,
don't you think?

1118
01:25:29,703 --> 01:25:33,503
Grimmer, about the gun, l lied.

1119
01:25:38,612 --> 01:25:40,512
Guess what?

1120
01:25:40,714 --> 01:25:42,579

<i>and the younger Kurt Von Metz.</i>

1134
01:26:57,357 --> 01:27:00,349
<i>Irrefutable evidence.</i>

1135
01:27:12,572 --> 01:27:15,132
Yes. Put him on.

1136
01:27:15,309 --> 01:27:17,243
Mr. Gutterman come out
of recovery yet?

1137
01:27:17,411 --> 01:27:18,400
Mr. Gutterman?

1138
01:27:18,578 --> 01:27:23,311
-Oh, you mean the whale from hell?
-Nurse!

1139
01:27:23,483 --> 01:27:27,783
Right on cue. Room 1 1 6. Help yourself.

1140
01:27:27,955 --> 01:27:31,447
-Help!
-Aren't you gonna see what's wrong?

1141
01:27:31,625 --> 01:27:35,322
l'd rather set my head on fire and
have it put out with a sledgehammer.

1142
01:27:35,495 --> 01:27:37,486
Nurse!

1143
01:27:37,698 --> 01:27:41,099
-l'd like to see that, actually.
-You son of a bitch!

1144
01:27:42,202 --> 01:27:45,330
Oh, no, watch the ass! Watch the ass!

1145
01:27:45,505 --> 01:27:47,632
Watch the ass! Watch the ass!

1146
01:27:47,808 --> 01:27:50,436
Oh, my God! Wait a minute.

1147
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:55,141
You schmucks! l have a hole in my ass!

1148
01:27:55,315 --> 01:27:57,408
That's why they call you an asshole.

1149
01:27:57,617 --> 01:28:01,178
You call this a wheelchair?
Get out of here!

1150
01:28:01,355 --> 01:28:05,018
Hi. Hey, you! You call this protection?

1151
01:28:05,225 --> 01:28:07,955
l wouldn't be in this fix
if it wasn't for you, mister.

1152
01:28:08,128 --> 01:28:10,653
You really got your ass
in a sling this time.

1153
01:28:10,831 --> 01:28:11,855
How you feeling?

1154
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:15,524
What do you mean, how am l feeling?
l'm dancing <i>Swan Lake</i> this afternoon.

1155
01:28:15,736 --> 01:28:17,670
Didn't they tell you? How am l feeling?

1156
01:28:17,838 --> 01:28:19,965
They took 1 2 ounces of lead
out of my ass!

1157
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:22,870
You needed some lead taken
out of your ass. You know that.

1158
01:28:23,043 --> 01:28:28,174
Funny. Funny. Now l got six months
of ass jokes to look forward to.

1159
01:28:28,348 --> 01:28:30,612
-How's Ellis?
-Oh, he's great.

1160
01:28:30,784 --> 01:28:32,684
He's one floor down.
Want to go see him?

1161
01:28:32,853 --> 01:28:34,480
-Yeah, you drive.
-Okay.

1162
01:28:34,654 --> 01:28:36,053
Oh, shit.

1163
01:28:36,289 --> 01:28:38,814
Who are the children of the night?

1164
01:28:38,992 --> 01:28:41,722
We are the children of the night.

1165
01:28:41,895 --> 01:28:46,389
-l think he's in there.
-They are the children of the night.

1166
01:28:46,566 --> 01:28:48,693
Easy.

1167
01:28:51,638 --> 01:28:53,196
What kind of monsters are we?

1168
01:28:53,373 --> 01:28:55,398
Dinosaurs!

1169
01:28:55,642 --> 01:28:59,009
-What kind of dinosaurs?
-Tyrannosaurus rex!

1170
01:28:59,212 --> 01:29:02,340
Let me see the Tyrannosaurus rex.

1171
01:29:05,685 --> 01:29:09,052
Hey, Mac. Just entertaining
the troops. Harry!

1172
01:29:09,222 --> 01:29:12,521
Everybody, this is Harry the Hippo,
the super spy l told you about.

1173
01:29:12,692 --> 01:29:15,024
Let's give him a hand.

1174
01:29:15,195 --> 01:29:17,527
-He's too fat to be a spy.
-Yeah!

1175
01:29:17,697 --> 01:29:19,187
-Fat guys can't be spies!
-Yeah!

1176
01:29:19,366 --> 01:29:21,698
l'm not fat. Wait a minute!

1177
01:29:21,868 --> 01:29:25,099
Hold it! Hold it down! l'm not fat.
l'm Harry Gutterman.

1178
01:29:25,338 --> 01:29:27,533
-l'm an international agent.
-No, you're not!

1179
01:29:27,707 --> 01:29:29,038
-And l am disguised...
-No.

1180
01:29:29,242 --> 01:29:32,734
...this week as a fat guy.
This is all Jell-O.

1181
01:29:32,913 --> 01:29:36,713
That's why l smell like strawberries.
Feel. Go ahead.

1182
01:29:36,883 --> 01:29:38,874
Easy now, he's a national treasure.

1183
01:29:39,052 --> 01:29:42,021
Listen, who wants to hear how l broke
the Von Metz case?

1184
01:29:42,189 --> 01:29:43,884
-Me!
-All right, all right.

1185
01:29:44,057 --> 01:29:47,117
Bring me to those glazed doughnuts,
and l'll tell you about it.

1186
01:29:47,327 --> 01:29:49,420
First of all, l had this dog, no nose.

1187
01:29:49,596 --> 01:29:52,064
-How did he smell?
-Terrible, take my word for it.

1188
01:29:52,232 --> 01:29:54,632
-He's great with kids.
-First there was this guy...

1189
01:29:54,835 --> 01:29:58,202
...a real son of a bitch,
but l didn't give a shit about him.

1190
01:29:58,371 --> 01:30:02,102
-This is when l was thinner.
-You know, Riva came by this morning.

1191
01:30:02,275 --> 01:30:04,436
-How's she doing?
-Great. You were in therapy.

1192
01:30:04,611 --> 01:30:06,943
-Yes, would l lie to children?
-Yeah!

1193
01:30:07,114 --> 01:30:08,604
-Let's take a walk, okay?
-Okay.

1194
01:30:08,782 --> 01:30:12,343
You know, you're all getting on my
nerves. Nurse, take them out of here!

1195
01:30:13,587 --> 01:30:16,556
-Look, Ellis--
-lt sounds serious.

1196
01:30:16,723 --> 01:30:22,161
Yeah. l know you were looking forward
to being partners, and so was l really.

1197
01:30:22,362 --> 01:30:26,321
Riva recruited Harry and l to be secret
agents with the lsraeli government.

1198
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,627
-You know, the Mossad.
-Yeah.

1199
01:30:28,802 --> 01:30:33,000
Naturally, l have to convert to Judaism.
l'm gonna be bar mitzvahed tomorrow.

1200
01:30:33,173 --> 01:30:38,008
We leave for Tel Aviv the next day to
train at a secret site in the Sinai Desert.

1201
01:30:38,178 --> 01:30:39,770
-Really?
-Yeah.

1202
01:30:39,946 --> 01:30:44,280
The only thing l'm worried about is,
l have to be circumcised.

1203
01:30:44,451 --> 01:30:45,941
Circumcised? You're kidding.

1204
01:30:46,119 --> 01:30:49,088
Yeah.

1205
01:30:49,256 --> 01:30:53,522
Oh, Mac. Mac, Mac, Mac.

1206
01:30:53,693 --> 01:30:56,992
You know why we make
such good partners?

1207
01:30:57,164 --> 01:30:58,961
No, why?

1208
01:30:59,132 --> 01:31:02,101
Because technically,
you're crazier than l am.

1209
01:31:02,269 --> 01:31:05,102
l knew that.
