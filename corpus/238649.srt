1
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:21,521
A TEENAGE
GIRL FALLS SIX STORIES,
THEN WALKS AWAY UNSCATHED.

2
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,527
A MAN BURSTS INTO FLAMES
WITH NO SIGNS OF BURNS.

3
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:36,036
ONE THING'S FOR SURE:
IT'S GETTING WEIRDER
OUT THERE EVERY DAY.

4
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,538
BUT THE TRUTH IS SPOKEN HERE.

5
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,571
HELP ME.

6
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,073
WHAT?

7
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,512
SMILE, LOSER.

8
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,531
NO NEED TO RUN ANYMORE, EMMA.

9
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:54,033
YOU'RE AMONG FRIENDS.

10
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,535
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

11
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,542
WAIT, WHAT'S GOING ON?

12
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,544
ALL YOUR QUESTIONS
WILL BE ANSWERED.

13
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:08,047
RIGHT NOW, TIME TO GO.

14
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,570
CHECK OUT THESE SHOTS, ADAM.

15
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,072
TERRIFIC. UPLINK
TO SANCTUARY DATABASE.

16
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:35,074
SHALIMAR, JESSE, GREAT WORK.

17
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,076
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME
WHO THE HELL YOU GUYS ARE AND

18
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,078
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

19
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,080
SORRY, EMMA. I'M ADAM.

20
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,583
AND THIS IS MUTANT X.

21
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,323
EMMA, YOUR ASSAILANTS
WERE MEMBERS OF A
SECURITY WING OF GENOME X,

22
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:02,829
A BIOTECH FIRM
WHICH IS ACTUALLY A SECRET
BRANCH OF U.S. INTELLIGENCE.

23
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,832
NOW THIS IS
A VISUAL CLOAK AND...

24
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:09,335
PLEASE DON'T PANIC.

25
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,840
I CAN'T SEE.

26
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,341
IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.

27
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,369
SO, WHY DO
THEY CARE ABOUT ME?

28
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,872
IT'S YOUR
TELE-EMPATHIC GIFT.

29
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,375
YOUR POWER TO SENSE
THE FEELINGS OF OTHERS AND
TO INFLUENCE THOSE FEELINGS.

30
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,878
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

31
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,897
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

32
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,899
IS THAT WHAT I LOOKED
LIKE WHEN I FIRST SAW IT?

33
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,901
NO,
YOU JUST STARTED CRYING.

34
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,904
KIDDING.

35
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,907
SHALIMAR AND JESSE AND YOU
ARE ALL CHILDREN OF GENOME X.

36
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:26,412
GENOME X CONDUCTED A SECRET
HUMAN GENETICS PROGRAM WHICH HAD

37
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:29,916
THE UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES
OF CREATING MEN AND WOMEN WITH

38
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:33,419
SPECIAL ABILITIES LIKE
YOUR TELE-EMPATHIC POWER.

39
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,922
I KEEP TELLING YOU:
I DON'T HAVE ANY POWERS.

40
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,925
NOW, YOU'RE AWARE OF THESE
ODD STORIES THAT WE'VE BEEN

41
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,927
HEARING ABOUT RECENTLY.

42
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,430
CURIOUS EVENTS, INEXPLICABLE
MYSTERIES, HUMAN ODDITIES.

43
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,433
YEAH, BUT I NEVER BELIEVED
THOSE STORIES WERE TRUE.

44
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,936
YES, ALRIGHT, SOME OF
THEM ARE FAKE, SOME OF THEM ARE

45
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:53,940
HOAXES, BUT TO AN ALARMING
DEGREE, IT'S THE CHILDREN OF

46
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,442
GENOME X THAT ARE
BEHIND SUCH PHENOMENA.

47
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,445
SO, IT'S NOT ALL ALIENS AND
CRYSTALS AND RE-INCARNATION,

48
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,446
HUH?

49
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,448
YEAH, WELL OF COURSE NOT,
YOU'VE SEEN WHAT JESSE AND

50
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,950
SHALIMAR CAN DO.

51
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,452
THERE ARE PERHAPS A THOUSAND
CHILDREN OF GENOME X. NOW, SOME

52
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,955
OF THEM KNOW WHO AND WHAT
THEY ARE, BUT SOME OF THEM ARE

53
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,959
TERRIFIED AT THE CHANGES
THAT ARE HAPPENING TO THEM.

54
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,962
WELL, I STILL DON'T
GET WHY YOU KIDNAPPED ME.

55
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,965
WELL, I PREFER
TO CALL IT RECRUITMENT.

56
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,472
SO, ARE YOU ONE
OF THESE CHILDREN TOO?

57
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:31,477
NO, I WAS CHIEF
BIO-GENETICIST AT GENOME X.

58
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,992
THERE WERE TWO
MEN AND ONE WOMAN.

59
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,995
THE WOMAN,
SHE ATTACKED LIKE A TIGER.

60
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,497
ONE OF THE MEN SEEMED TO BE
ABLE TO GO FROM INTANGIBLE TO

61
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:54,000
MASSIVE AT WILL.

62
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,003
AND THE SECOND MAN GRABBED
THE GIRL BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO

63
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,505
GET TO HER.

64
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,008
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
ADAM AND HIS PEOPLE.

65
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:06,512
OUR GS AGENTS
ARE NEW AT THIS.

66
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:15,021
WELL, THEY HAVE TO GET BETTER
-- AND FAST, MR. THORNE.

67
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,023
YES, MR. ECKHART.

68
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,025
YEAH.

69
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:29,035
AH, GOOD TO GO, HUH?

70
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,546
DESPITE
YOUR GENETICALLY ENHANCED
ABILITIES, THE CHILDREN OF

71
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,548
GENOME X ARE NOT SUPER-HUMAN.

72
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,550
I KEEP TELLING YOU,
I DON'T HAVE ANY...

73
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,552
IT'S WIDELY
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO
RECOGNIZE THE TOLL THAT

74
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,555
THESE ABILITIES TAKE
ON YOUR BODY, MIND AND SOUL.

75
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,756
SOUL?

76
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,758
SOUL.

77
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,261
THERE'S A SPIRITUAL
SIDE TO YOUR CONDITION TOO.

78
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,764
MANY OF THE
NEW MUTANTS ARE UNDER THE
DELUSION THAT THEY'RE GOD.

79
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,274
NOW, I'VE DESIGNED THIS VDD
TO DIAGNOSTICALLY CALIBRATE YOUR

80
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,777
GENETIC ENHANCEMENT AND TO
IDENTIFY ANY ADJUSTMENT TO YOUR

81
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,781
DNA THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED,
SINCE YOUR NEW MUTANT DNA,

82
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,784
IT'S IN A CONSTANT
STATE OF EVOLUTION.

83
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,791
WELL, THAT WAS TOO WEIRD.

84
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,293
KIND OF LIKE HIM MYSELF.

85
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,794
YEAH, ME TOO.

86
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,796
HELPS ME GET IN
TOUCH WITH MY POWERS.

87
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,298
WELL, I DON'T
HAVE ANY POWERS.

88
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,301
AND I'M CERTAINLY
NOT A FREAK LIKE YOU TWO.

89
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,303
FREAK?

90
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,820
JESSE IS VERY SENSITIVE.

91
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,823
SHALIMAR IS VERY TERRITORIAL
AND VERY PROTECTIVE OF THE

92
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,825
PEOPLE SHE LOVES.

93
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,328
AND THAT INCLUDES JESSE.

94
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,838
CALL ME PARANOID.

95
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,841
BUT I FIGURE THE PARANOID
WILL INHERIT THE EARTH.

96
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,847
I THOUGHT YOU'D
OUTGROWN CARTOONS.

97
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,349
I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT ALL
THE STUFF THAT'S BEEN GOING ON

98
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,850
AH, IT'S CRAP.

99
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,353
AND THE INTERACTIVE
HOTLINE'S GOT TO BE A SCAM.

100
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,855
WHEN YOU TWO ARE FINISHED,
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE

101
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,357
STEPPING UP TO
THE BIG LEAGUES TOMORROW.

102
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,359
THE DEAL WITH CARTER'S A GO.

103
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:50,376
I HEARD ABOUT ALL THAT
BUSINESS LAST NIGHT, MASON.

104
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,379
SOUNDS LIKE ADAM TO ME.

105
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,382
YOU SEEM ALMOST AMUSED.

106
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,886
THAT YOU DON'T DESPISE
HIM FOR BETRAYING YOU REMAINS A

107
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,888
MYSTERY TO ME.

108
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,392
THAT YOU HOLD HIM RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE COLLAPSE OF YOUR

109
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,396
IMMUNE SYSTEM WOULD HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT, EH?

110
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,898
YOU WERE ALWAYS
TOO HARD ON ADAM.

111
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,900
AND YOU WERE ALWAYS
TOO EASY, PAUL.

112
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,403
AND THAT'S HOW
HE STOLE YOUR DATABASE.

113
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,905
WHICH I HAVE
NEARLY RECONSTRUCTED.

114
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:24,410
SO WE CAN MAKE
AMENDS FOR THE HORRIFIC
MISTAKES WE'VE MADE.

115
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,429
I SHOULD HAVE KILLED ADAM
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

116
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,932
AND NOW BREEDLOVE
INTENDS TO GO TO THE PRESS
AND EXPOSE EVERYTHING.

117
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,936
AND I'LL NEVER GET THE CHANCE
TO BRING ADAM TO THE JUSTICE

118
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,938
THAT HE DESERVES.

119
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,941
WELL,
WE CAN CHANGE ALL OF THAT.

120
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,448
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

121
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,951
WELL, I CAN'T COERCE HER INTO
ADMITTING SHE'S A NEW MUTANT.

122
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:10,456
FINE, I GUESS WE'VE DONE
EVERYTHING WE CAN, THEN.

123
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,459
MAYBE THE NEXT STEP IS TO
GET HER OUT OF TOWN

124
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,462
-- UNDER ECKHART'S RADAR.

125
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,465
I'LL GET
JESSE STARTED THEN.

126
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,467
GOOD.

127
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:52,791
NORMAL PEOPLE DON'T WANT
SUPER-POWERED FREAKS NEXT DOOR.

128
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,794
I DON'T THINK THEY'LL BE
TOO THRILLED ABOUT HAVING NEW

129
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,796
MUTANTS AS COVERT OPS EITHER.

130
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,298
WELL, WE PUT THEM
IN THE FIELD AS AGENTS,

131
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:00,799
NO ONE
WILL KNOW ABOUT IT.

132
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:08,307
SORRY TO BARGE IN LIKE THIS,
PAUL, BUT I WANTED MR. THORNE

133
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,310
TO HAVE A LOOK AT SECURITY
SO HE'D BE ABLE TO BE

134
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,813
READY FOR YOU
WHEN YOU GO PUBLIC.

135
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,316
THAT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA.

136
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:21,320
SINCE I'M GOING TO THE PRESS
NEXT WEEK WITH FULL DISCLOSURE

137
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,323
OF WHAT'S BEEN
HAPPENING HERE SINCE THE
INCEPTION OF THIS PROGRAM.

138
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,825
AT LEAST CALL ME FIRST.

139
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:31,330
HAVE TO APPROACH
THIS WITH FINESSE.

140
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,337
I'LL GIVE
YOU A HEADS-UP.

141
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,339
THANKS, PAUL.

142
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,346
YOU SHOULD COME DOWN
AND VISIT US MORE OFTEN.

143
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,859
A WEEK DOESN'T
GIVE YOU MUCH TIME.

144
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,688
WOOH.

145
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,691
SO I GOT HERE A LITTLE EARLY.

146
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:35,694
THOUGHT I'D TAKE HER
OUT FOR A LITTLE TEST DRIVE.

147
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:36,695
WHAT?

148
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,697
YOU TOOK IT FOR A SPIN?

149
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,200
YOU GOT ANY IDEA WHAT WE COULD
GET FOR THIS AT A CHOP SHOP?

150
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,702
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WE"?

151
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:46,205
UNLIKE YOU, I SET
HIGHER GOALS FOR MYSELF
THAN GRAND THEFT AUTO.

152
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,208
RIGHT ON TIME, I SEE.

153
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:54,713
MR. CARTER,
YOU REMEMBER BRENNAN AND TONY.

154
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,216
IT'S A BEAUTY.

155
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,218
I BET IT TAKES THE
CURVES AT 120, HUH?

156
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,721
I MEANT THE HICKMAN AND
WRIGHTSON SECURITIES BUILDING.

157
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:07,226
NOW, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
HAVE ONLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

158
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,728
SECONDS ONCE THE ALARM
IS CUT TO GET IN AND GET OUT.

159
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,231
WHEN YOU PICKED
MY POCKET THIS MORNING,
YOU GOT YOUR HANDS ON THIS.

160
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,733
THE VICE-PRESIDENT HAS THE TWIN.

161
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,236
THESE TWO KEYS NEED TO
BE ACTIVATED SIMULTANEOUSLY.

162
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:21,240
NOT TO WORRY, MR. CARTER,
WE WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

163
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,741
YEAH, SEE THAT YOU DON'T.

164
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,744
BECAUSE THERE'S
ALWAYS SOMEBODY THAT WANTS
YOUR PLACE ON THE FOOD CHAIN.

165
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,468
YOU.

166
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,470
YOU GOT STONES OF STEEL, DOG.

167
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,474
TAKING A JOYRIDE
IN THE CLIENT'S CAR.

168
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,475
NICE.

169
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,477
YEAH.

170
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,980
SO, NOW YOU SEE WHY
A CHOP SHOP ISN'T AN OPTION.

171
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,483
WHAT'S UP?

172
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:05,984
I DON'T KNOW.

173
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,486
I'VE BEEN
HANGING AROUND.

174
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,494
THIS WAY.

175
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:17,996
WELL,
I'LL SAY ONE THING.

176
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,499
THIS MUST BE ONE
HELL OF A BOOK STORE.

177
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,000
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

178
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,518
ADAM...

179
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,520
AND A PRETTY GIRL.

180
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,022
IT'S ALMOST READY.

181
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,023
GOOD.

182
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,025
EMMA, SAY HELLO TO RUBY.

183
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:53,532
YES, THE PLACE IS A MESS,
BUT I AM SPOTLESS -- TRUST ME.

184
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,535
YOUR MIND, IT'S
AN OPEN BOOK TO ME.

185
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:00,038
RUBY'S A TELEPATH.

186
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,541
I PREFER ESPER,
IT JUST SOUNDS...

187
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,043
SEXIER.

188
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:12,050
OH ADAM, YOU TOLD
ME SHE WAS SPECIAL.

189
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,053
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME HOW SPECIAL.

190
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:19,558
WELL, COME ON, LET'S GO.

191
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,079
JUST LIKE IN THE MOVIES.

192
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,586
ALLISON, VINCE,
THIS IS EMMA.

193
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,587
WHAT'S UP, ADAM.

194
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,088
ADAM.

195
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,108
HEY, GIRL, WHAT'S UP.

196
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,610
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

197
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,111
THIS IS A NEW
MUTANT SAFE HOUSE.

198
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,113
SAFE FROM WHAT?

199
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,616
YOUR ASSAILANTS LAST NIGHT, THEY
WERE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

200
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,118
SO, WHAT'S YOUR POWER?

201
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,621
I DON'T HAVE ANY POWERS.

202
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,623
AH, POWER OF DENIAL.

203
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,625
SO, YOU READY TO LEAVE TOMORROW?

204
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,127
WE'RE GOING TO
GET YOU OUT OF TOWN.

205
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,130
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A
NEW IDENTITY, A WHOLE NEW LIFE.

206
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,132
WELL, WHAT IF
I DON'T WANT TO GO?

207
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:38,637
WELL,
THE PEOPLE WE RESCUED YOU
FROM LAST NIGHT WILL TRY AGAIN.

208
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,640
AND THEY'RE NOWHERE
NEAR AS FRIENDLY AS WE ARE.

209
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,142
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW HER AROUND.

210
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,144
YEAH.

211
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,151
IT'S TOO BAD ABOUT EMMA, HUH?

212
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,653
YEAH, NO KIDDING.

213
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,154
ADAM HAD A LOT
OF HOPES FOR HER.

214
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,156
NOW IT'S
STILL JUST US.

215
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,659
WELL,
WE'VE BOTH SEEN THAT
KIND OF DENIAL BEFORE.

216
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:06,164
YOU OKAY?

217
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,667
FINE, WHY?

218
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:13,672
WELL, SHE WAS PRETTY
NASTY TO BOTH OF US.

219
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:17,676
YEAH, SHE WAS ALSO
SCARED OUT OF HER WITS.

220
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:21,179
STILL, IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE
ANOTHER WOMAN ON THE TEAM.

221
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,682
I'M WITH YOU ON THAT ONE.

222
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,685
I THOUGHT SHE WOULD
HAVE MADE A GOOD FIT.

223
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,192
"WHEN GENOME X WAS CONCEIVED,
WE SAW OURSELVES AS PIONEERS

224
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,696
IN A NEW FRONTIER OF KNOWLEDGE.

225
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:48,206
MEN AND WOMEN WITH THE
POWER TO REMAKE THE WORLD.

226
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:52,210
THE POWER TO PLAY
GOD WITH THE GENETIC CODE.

227
00:21:56,715 --> 00:22:01,720
ALL OF US AT GENOME X FEEL
ENORMOUS GUILT FOR THE HARM WE

228
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:11,730
HAVE CAUSED IN MANIPULATING
DNA AGAINST THE LAWS OF NATURE."

229
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,234
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, PAUL.

230
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,737
AND WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

231
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,239
I DON'T
SHARE YOUR GUILT.

232
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:26,745
"THE GOVERNMENT OWES ENORMOUS
REPARATIONS TO THE VICTIMS OF

233
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:32,250
GENOME X FOR THE HORROR
INFLICTED ON THESE INNOCENTS."

234
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:39,257
CAN'T PUT THE DEMONS
BACK IN THE BOX AFTER
THEY'VE BEEN RELEASED.

235
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:43,261
THERE'S NO NEED FOR THEM TO
SUFFER WITHOUT COMPENSATION.

236
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,764
THE ONLY THING THIS
COMPENSATES IS YOUR GUILT.

237
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,767
YOU CREATE THESE ANOMALIES
AND THEN MAKE IT BETTER BY

238
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:53,271
APOLOGIZING, AND LET SOMEONE
ELSE CLEAN UP AFTER YOU.

239
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,775
PERHAPS IF YOU RECOGNIZED ADAM
FOR THE CRIMINAL THAT HE IS,

240
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:00,779
YOU WOULDN'T
BE SO SELF- DELUDED.

241
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,281
MR. THORNE.

242
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,298
BEFORE YOU WENT OFF THE DEEP
END YOU SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED

243
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,801
WITH ONE OF
YOUR INNOCENT VICTIMS.

244
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,302
WHAT?

245
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,303
THAT'S RIGHT.

246
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,806
DON'T HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE TO ME, DR. BREEDLOVE,

247
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:30,809
BECAUSE I'M A CHILD OF
GENOME X AND, QUITE FRANKLY,

248
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:33,311
I WOULDN'T HAVE GOT THIS
JOB IF I WASN'T SO SPECIAL.

249
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,313
IF ONLY YOU'D
KEPT YOUR MOUTH SHUT,

250
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,815
EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE.

251
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,317
BUT YOU HAD TO
BEAT YOURSELF UP WITH GUILT
OVER THE MESS YOU'VE MADE.

252
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:43,822
AND NOW I HAVE TO USE
YOUR LEMONS TO MAKE LEMONADE.

253
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:29,367
IT WAS NICE OF HIM TO REBUILD
THE DATABASE BEFORE HE DIED.

254
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:38,877
IT WILL MAKE TRACKING THESE
ANOMALIES THAT MUCH EASIER.

255
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,386
SO MUCH FOR THE PAPER TRAIL.

256
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:15,900
YOUR NEW IDENTITY.

257
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,403
EVERYTHING YOU NEED.

258
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,909
HEY.

259
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,912
TELL JESSE I'M SORRY
FOR THAT "FREAK" CRACK.

260
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,915
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

261
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,917
IT'S ALREADY FORGOTTEN.

262
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,427
I GOT TO TELL YOU,
GIRL, I UNDERSTAND YOUR
DECISION COMPLETELY.

263
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,430
WHAT DECISION?

264
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,932
NOT TO JOIN MUTANT X. I
MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE EVERY NEW

265
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,435
MUTANT'S A HERO.

266
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,947
DID EVERYTHING GO AS PLANNED?

267
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,450
FIVE HUNDRED
TREASURY CERTIFICATES,
EACH WORTH TEN GRAND.

268
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,452
FOR A TOTAL OF TEN MIL'.

269
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,454
OH, WELL, ACTUALLY
THAT'S TWENTY MILLION.

270
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,956
SINCE THE CERTIFICATES BELONGED
TO YOU ALREADY, THAT'S TEN

271
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:14,959
MILLION AND ANOTHER TEN
FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY.

272
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,461
SMART BOY.

273
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,463
A THIEF WHO KNOWS
HIS INVESTMENTS.

274
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,964
I'D KEEP AN EYE ON
HIM IF I WERE YOU.

275
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,967
WHAT, HE PAYS US CHUMP CHANGE
AND DOUBLES HIS TEN MIL'?

276
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,470
THAT'S THE NATURE
OF THE BUSINESS.

277
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,488
HOTLINE.

278
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:43,988
CAN I HELP YOU?

279
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,490
YEAH.

280
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,991
IS IT TRUE YOU'RE
OFFERING MONEY FOR STORIES.

281
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,993
IF THEY'RE INTERESTING.

282
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,496
DO I HAVE A FREAK FOR YOU.

283
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,999
THIS GUY NAMED MULWRAY, BRENNAN
MULWRAY, SHOOTS LIGHTNING

284
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,001
FROM HIS HANDS.

285
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,003
AND HE'S A THIEF TOO.

286
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,508
WITH DR. BREEDLOVE'S DEATH,

287
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:06,511
I HAVE SET
IN MOTION SEVERAL SWEEPING
CHANGES IN OUR OPERATION.

288
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:11,015
STARTING WITH AN
EXPANDED BUDGET THAT WILL
AFFECT ALL DEPARTMENTS.

289
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:15,019
WE HAVE OPERATED UNDER
COVERT CONDITIONS SINCE

290
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,522
THE INCEPTION OF THIS PROJECT.

291
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:21,526
THAT NEED FOR
SECRECY HAS BEEN BROUGHT
HOME BY THIS BRUTAL MURDER.

292
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:27,031
A HEINOUS CRIME THAT WAS
COMMITTED BY A PRODUCT OF THE

293
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:31,035
PROGRAM, WHO SOMEHOW MANAGED
TO BREAK INTO OUR ARCHIVES

294
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:37,041
SECTION AND BURN
THAT HISTORICAL LANDMARK TO
THE GROUND IN THE PROCESS.

295
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:42,046
GENOME X WILL
NOT BE COWED, CORRUPTED OR
CO-OPTED BY THESE CREATURES.

296
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:46,050
INSTEAD, I HAVE BEEN MANDATED
TO CREATE THE GENETIC SECURITY

297
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:50,555
AGENCY TO PROTECT THE WORLD
FROM THIS RAPACIOUS MENACE.

298
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:56,060
WHILE OUR
PURE RESEARCH CONTINUES,
THIS COVERT FORCE WILL

299
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:01,065
TAKE THESE ANOMALIES
INTO CUSTODY UNDER A
CLOAK OF ABSOLUTE SECRECY.

300
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:06,070
I KNOW I CAN COUNT
ON YOU ALL TO DO YOUR BEST
IN THIS TIME OF TRANSITION.

301
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,073
THANK YOU.

302
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,084
THAT WENT WELL, DON'T YOU THINK?

303
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,587
WELL, THEY SEEMED HAPPY.

304
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:27,091
DON'T GET CARRIED
AWAY, MR. THORNE.

305
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:33,097
THEY'RE ALL JUST
EASILY BOUGHT BY FLATTERY
AND BIGGER PAYCHEQUES.

306
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:36,100
STATUS?

307
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,602
OH.

308
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,104
WE HAVE A LEAD ON THE ELECTRICAL
ANOMALY FROM OUR TAPS ON

309
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:43,107
THE PROXY BLUE HOTLINE.

310
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,109
MAY I?

311
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,613
DO I HAVE A FREAK FOR YOU.

312
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,616
THIS GUY NAMED MULWRAY, BRENNAN
MULWRAY, SHOOTS LIGHTNING

313
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:54,118
FROM HIS HANDS.

314
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,621
AND HE'S A THIEF TOO.

315
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,123
NICELY DONE.

316
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,125
THANK YOU.

317
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:05,630
WELL, LET'S START PERFORMING
THE JOB THAT WE WERE BORN TO

318
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,632
DO, SHALL WE?

319
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,634
INDEED.

320
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,787
SO HOW WELL DID YOU
KNOW THIS BREEDLOVE?

321
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,290
HE WAS MY MENTOR.

322
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:11,796
HE WAS THE GUY WHO STARTED
GENOME X. NOW, WITH HIS DEATH,

323
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:15,800
EVERYTHING I FEARED
HAS COME TO PASS.

324
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,811
OKAY, THE HYDROFOIL
LEAVES IN FIFTEEN MINUTES.

325
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,813
LET'S GO.

326
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,317
WHAT?

327
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:33,818
OH MY GOD.

328
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,320
WHAT?

329
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,321
IT'S THEM.

330
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,324
THEM?

331
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:47,332
THE GUYS THAT WERE AFTER ME.

332
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,343
DAMMIT.

333
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,350
ADAM?

334
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,351
ADAM?

335
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,852
I AM SO SORRY.

336
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,854
LOOK, EMMA USED
HER POWERS TO DITCH ME.

337
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,356
I'LL CHECK IN LATER.

338
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,359
WELL, SO MUCH FOR DENIAL.

339
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,860
WE GOT TO FIND HER.

340
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,861
YEAH.

341
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,364
CAN'T LET SOMEONE WITH HER
ABILITY TO MANIPULATE THE

342
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,866
FEELINGS OF OTHERS BECOME
THE TOOL OF OUR WORST NIGHTMARE.

343
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:25,370
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

344
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:40,885
BINGO.

345
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,387
ADAM, I'VE ACCESSED
THE SATELLITE DATA FEED.

346
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:43,388
THANKS, JESSE.

347
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,390
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO
DO IS FIND ALLISON'S CAR.

348
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:48,393
ON THE TRAIL, ADAM.

349
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,900
THIS SEAT TAKEN?

350
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,402
HEY, NO.

351
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:59,404
HAVE A SEAT.

352
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,406
I WAS KIND OF
HOPING TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

353
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,418
ACTUALLY, I SAW INTO
YOU THE OTHER NIGHT.

354
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:14,919
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

355
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,422
IT'S A GIFT.

356
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:21,426
I THOUGHT
I COULD SENSE SOMETHING
SPECIAL ABOUT YOU TOO.

357
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:23,428
OH YEAH?

358
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,431
YEAH, BUT IT'S...

359
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,933
IT'S NOT A MIND THING.

360
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,935
YOU SEE,
I FOUND OUT I COULD THROW
OFF SPARKS WHEN A KID.

361
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:32,937
YOU KNOW, BEING THAT...

362
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:36,941
THAT DIFFERENT WAS JUST
ASKING FOR A WORLD OF HURT.

363
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,444
SO I ALWAYS
FELT LIKE A FREAK.

364
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,446
NO ONE EVER
SAW YOU DO IT?

365
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,448
NO, LIKE I SAID,
I KEEP IT TO MYSELF.

366
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,950
SAME WITH ME.

367
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,953
ONE DAY I'M SALESGIRL OF THE
MONTH AT LEVERMAN AND STOKES

368
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,456
AND...

369
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,458
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
HOW PERSUASIVE I
CAN BE WHEN IT COMES TO

370
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,460
MISSES AND PETITES.

371
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,962
NO, I DON'T THINK
I'D BE SURPRISED AT ALL.

372
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:01,466
NEXT DAY,
I'M TRAPPED IN SOMEBODY
ELSE'S PARANOID FANTASY.

373
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,469
NO ONE WANTS TO BE FRIENDS WITH
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW YOU'RE

374
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,972
FEELING AND CAN MAKE
YOU FEEL ANY WAY YOU CHOOSE.

375
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:11,976
BUT I USED TO LOVE TO
GET DATES TO JUMP THROUGH HOOPS

376
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,978
SATURDAY NIGHT.

377
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,480
YEAH, I'LL BET.

378
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,982
OH, NOW YOU JUST USE
YOUR POWERS FOR GOOD?

379
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:19,984
I DON'T THINK
I'D CALL THEM POWERS.

380
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:21,986
COMES AND GOES, AND WHEN
THEY'RE HERE I DON'T HAVE A REAL

381
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,988
GOOD HANDLE ON THEM.

382
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:25,990
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

383
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:34,999
HERE, TOUCH MY HAND.

384
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,002
TOUCH MY HAND.

385
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,009
NICE.

386
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,512
THERE'S THIS GUY, ADAM.

387
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,515
HE THINKS I CAN
LEARN TO CONTROL MY POWERS
WITH A LITTLE TRAINING.

388
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:53,518
NOW HE'S GOING
TO BE PISSED AT ME.

389
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,520
HE WANTED
ME TO JOIN HIM.

390
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,022
I JUST GOT SCARED.

391
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,530
WOAH, WOAH,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

392
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:08,032
YOU'RE NOT
LEAVING, ARE YOU?

393
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,034
THE LADIES ROOM.

394
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:21,546
SENSATIONAL.

395
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,548
MIND IF I JOIN YOU, MR MULWRAY?

396
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,052
I'VE GOT IT, ADAM.

397
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,054
HALFWAY DOWN THE
500 BLOCK ON DARIEN STREET.

398
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:33,558
I'M ON MY WAY.

399
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,841
I TRACKED THE CAR.

400
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,843
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU.

401
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,346
THE QUESTION IS:
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

402
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,348
I CAME HERE TO MAKE
YOU THE DEAL OF A LIFETIME.

403
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:58,849
FAST CARS.

404
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,851
HOT WOMEN.

405
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:03,854
ALL THE MONEY YOU'LL EVER NEED.

406
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:06,357
SEE, THE...

407
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:10,361
THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A MAN OF
YOUR TALENT, THEY'RE LIMITLESS.

408
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:11,862
TALENTS?

409
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,870
DON'T BE COY.

410
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,372
I'VE BEEN WATCHING
YOU FOR A LONG TIME.

411
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,873
REALLY?

412
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,389
HUH?

413
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:40,391
YOU KNOW, AS...

414
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:44,395
AS TEMPTING AS THAT
MAY SOUND, I THINK I'LL PASS.

415
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,397
I WOULDN'T DO
THAT IF I WERE YOU.

416
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,412
SHE'S HEADED
FOR THE SKYCOURSE.

417
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,913
SHE'S NOT ALONE.

418
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,416
I'M ON MY WAY.

419
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,462
YOU GOT HIM.

420
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,465
NEVER USED IT
AGAINST A PERSON BEFORE.

421
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,966
IS HE DEAD?

422
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,468
I DON'T KNOW.

423
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,979
DID YOU REALLY
THINK WE'D COME AFTER
A GUY LIKE YOU WITHOUT

424
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,981
BEING PREPARED?

425
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:15,986
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

426
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:17,988
NO, IT'S NOT, IS IT?

427
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,990
WE KNOW YOUR M.O., MR. MULWRAY.

428
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:28,499
AH, DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO DO THAT?

429
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,502
PISS US OFF, BECAUSE WE'RE GOING
TO BEAT YOU SENSELESS ANYWAY.

430
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:40,511
YOU KNOW, ANYTIME YOU WANT
TO MAKE THESE GUYS JUMP THROUGH

431
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,012
HOOPS WOULD BE FINE WITH ME.

432
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:43,013
I CAN'T.

433
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:44,515
I LOSE IT WHEN
I'M STRESSED.

434
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,016
GREAT.

435
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,017
YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

436
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,520
IT'S GOING TO MAKE MR ECKHART
VERY HAPPY TO TAKE YOU ALIVE.

437
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,613
BRENNAN!

438
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,628
STOP.

439
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,631
LET THEM GO.

440
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,633
THIS ISN'T OVER YET.

441
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,142
ADAM.

442
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,144
I'M SO SORRY.

443
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:57,147
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
CAUSE ALL THIS TROUBLE.

444
00:41:57,147 --> 00:42:00,150
AND NOW YOU UNDERSTAND
THE DANGER WE'RE ALL IN.
