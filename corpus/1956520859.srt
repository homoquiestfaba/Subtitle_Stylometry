<font color="#ff00ff">Who wants to know?</font>

363
00:08:19,794 --> 00:08:20,794
<font color="#9370db">Let's just say</font>

364
00:08:20,962 --> 00:08:22,295
<font color="#9370db">a charming stranger.</font>

365
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:26,047

366

367
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,510
<font color="#ff00ff">than some girl he just met on the street.</font>

368
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:30,736
<font color="#9370db">Oh, but he'd like to.</font>

369
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,950
<font color="#9370db">Very much.</font>

370

371
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,937

372
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:44,648
<font color="#ff00ff">I doubt he has any idea how
a girl should be treated.</font>

373
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,432
<font color="#9370db">Like a Princess, I suppose.</font>

374

377
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:58,038

378

379
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,468

383

<font color="#ff00ff">never..</font>
<font color="#9370db">And never come back.</font>

385
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:20,268

386

444
00:10:55,728 --> 00:10:59,514

there wishing they could be you.</font>

445
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:01,806
<font color="#9370db">Because they have no idea

446
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:03,017
<font color="#dda0dd">Help me out here?</font>

447
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,858
<font color="#dda0dd">You are rich,
you live in a gorgeous palace,</font>

448
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,585
<font color="#dda0dd">you have beautiful women
throwing themselves at your feet.</font>

450
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:11,667

451
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:13,147
<font color="#9370db">Everything's decided for me.</font>

452
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,357
<font color="#9370db">Where I go, what I do, and who I see.</font>

453
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,948
<font color="#dda0dd">Your highness, this disappearing
thing has got to stop!</font>

454
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:20,042
<font color="#dda0dd">It is too dangerous!</font>

455
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,764
<font color="#9370db">It's perfectly safe Lionel,</font>

456
00:11:21,803 --> 00:11:23,824
<font color="#dda0dd">I am not worried about
you, I'm worried about me!</font>

457
00:11:23,856 --> 00:11:25,988
<font color="#dda0dd">I cannot keep lying to your mother!</font>

458
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:27,510
<font color="#dda0dd">They have laws against that!</font>

459
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:29,887
<font color="#dda0dd">If he wants to kill me</font>

460
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:31,480
<font color="#dda0dd">why does he not trample
me with his carriage</font>

461
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:32,514
<font color="#dda0dd">and get it over with.</font>

<font color="#dda0dd">Eh.</font>

463
00:11:35,853 --> 00:11:37,171

465
00:11:40,001 --> 00:11:42,094

just talking about you.</font>

467
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:47,155
<font color="#9370db">Alright, what's going on?</font>

468
00:11:47,475 --> 00:11:49,729
<font color="#c66074">Just planning a little get
together. Nothing fancy.</font>

469
00:11:49,815 --> 00:11:50,941
- <font color="#c66074">Just family.</font>

470
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,884

472
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:54,551

women in the kingdom.</font>

473
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:55,394
<font color="#9370db">Mother!</font>

474
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:57,489
<font color="#c66074">Were only talking maybe
4 or 500 at the most.</font>

475
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:59,508
<font color="#9370db">Mother you can't keep doing this to me.</font>

476
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,570
<font color="#c66074">What!</font>

477
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:02,659
<font color="#c66074">Max, what's he saying?</font>

478
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:04,232
<font color="#00bfff">He saying,</font>

479
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:05,871
<font color="#00bfff">he doesn't want to have another ball.</font>

480
00:12:05,952 --> 00:12:07,565
<font color="#c66074">No he's not!</font>

481

489
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:28,700

490
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:33,956
<font color="#00bfff">All your mother and I want
is for you to be happy.</font>

491
00:12:34,114 --> 00:12:36,047
<font color="#c66074">Happiness has nothing to do with it!</font>

492
00:12:37,384 --> 00:12:39,423
<font color="#c66074">I mean of course, we want you to be happy.</font>

493
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:41,698
<font color="#c66074">But you do have certain obligations.</font>

494
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:44,174
<font color="#00bfff">What your mother is trying to say is,</font>

495
00:12:44,874 --> 00:12:47,342
<font color="#00bfff">we think it's time you chose a bride</font>

496
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,066
<font color="#00bfff">and produced an heir.</font>

497
00:12:49,164 --> 00:12:51,926
<font color="#c66074">Someday soon this entire
kingdom will be yours.</font>

498
00:12:51,975 --> 00:12:53,182
<font color="#00bfff">Not that soon.</font>

499
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:57,417
<font color="#9370db">Look, all I'm asking is you
let me choose a bride for myself.</font>

500
00:12:57,671 --> 00:12:58,925
<font color="#9370db">In my own way.</font>

501
00:12:59,783 --> 00:13:03,537
<font color="#9370db">And I guess I have this silly idea that
I want to be in love when I get married.</font>

502
00:13:05,842 --> 00:13:07,104
<font color="#9370db">Like you were.</font>

503
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:11,362
<font color="#00bfff">That's all we want for you too son.</font>

504
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:15,001
<font color="#c66074">Yes darling, but there's nothing saying
that you can't fall in love at the ball.</font>

505
00:13:15,047 --> 00:13:16,723
<font color="#9370db">You haven't heard a word I've said!</font>
<font color="#c66074">It happens all the time.</font>

506
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,543

Where is he going!</font>

507
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:22,609

00:26:59,946 --> 00:27:02,684
<font color="#B8860B">Well, first I flutter my eyelashes.</font>

1452
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:04,746
<font color="#00b000">Excellent.</font>

1453
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:06,629

1458
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:22,487
<font color="#00b000">Tell me, what you're going

1459
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,922
<font color="#00b000">Minerva?</font>

1460

<font color="#B8860B">Well,</font>

1461
00:27:26,448 --> 00:27:29,678
<font color="#B8860B">you said to show him that there
is more to me than mere beauty.</font>

1462
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:31,094
<font color="#B8860B">So,</font>

1463
00:27:31,306 --> 00:27:33,061
<font color="#B8860B">I thought I might recite a poem.</font>

1464
00:27:33,093 --> 00:27:34,299
<font color="#7FFFD4">A poem!</font>

1465
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:36,339
<font color="#B8860B">What's wrong with that?</font>

1466
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:38,375
<font color="#00b000">Whatever you do girls,</font>

1467
00:27:38,536 --> 00:27:41,743
<font color="#00b000">you mustn't let the prince
know how clever you are.</font>

1468
00:27:41,774 --> 00:27:45,553
<font color="#00b000">Men can't stand to be around smart women.</font>

1469

<font color="#7FFFD4">Yes mother.</font>
<font color="#B8860B">Yes mother.</font>

00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:51,453
<font color="#00b000">For heaven sake Minerva
stop scratching yourself!</font>

1471
00:27:53,634 --> 00:27:57,546
<font color="#B8860B">I can't help it mother.
You know I get itchy when I'm nervous.</font>

1472
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:58,945
<font color="#00b000">Don't... do...</font>

1473
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:01,495
<font color="#00b000">that!</font>

1474
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:04,794
<font color="#00b000">And what are you going to say Calliope?</font>

1475
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:06,874
<font color="#7FFFD4">Well, mother..</font>

1476
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,494
<font color="#7FFFD4">I've been working on my
naturally infectious laughter.</font>

1477
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:12,087
<font color="#B8860B">Excuse me?</font>

1478
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:16,173
<font color="#7FFFD4">Tonight I'm going to laugh
infectiously at all the princes jokes.</font>

1479
00:28:17,123 --> 00:28:21,130
<font color="#7FFFD4">Ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.</font>

1480
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:21,584
<font color="#7FFFD4">Snort-snort!</font>

1481
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:22,476
<font color="#7FFFD4">Snort.</font>

1482
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,532
<font color="#00b000">I beg Calliope whatever you do</font>

1483
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:26,615
<font color="#00b000">try not to snort.</font>

1484
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,068
<font color="#7FFFD4">Yes mother.</font>

2395
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:20,108

2396
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:23,984

2397
00:45:24,726 --> 00:45:26,860

2398
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:28,692

2409
00:46:30,966 --> 00:46:32,331
<font color="#fcbc92">Cinderella.</font>

2410
00:46:33,986 --> 00:46:35,748

2411

2412
00:46:37,723 --> 00:46:39,159

2415
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:47,157
<font color="#fcbc92">Just remember, you got to be out of
there before the clock strikes 12:00.</font>

2416
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,380
<font color="#9370db">Hello.</font>

2417
00:47:52,681 --> 00:47:54,904
<font color="#ff00ff">How do you do your highness.</font>

2418
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:40,950
<font color="#00bfff">Who is that charming girl?</font>

2419
00:48:41,041 --> 00:48:43,411
<font color="#c66074">No one seems to know.
She is stunning isn't she.</font>

2420
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:44,522
<font color="#00bfff">Like a vision.</font>

2421
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,458
<font color="#00bfff">My, if I were a young man I'd..</font>

2422
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:49,428
<font color="#c66074">Yes dear..</font>

2423
00:48:50,965 --> 00:48:53,084
<font color="#00bfff">Well, I'd be younger wouldn't I.</font>

2424
00:48:53,632 --> 00:48:54,998
<font color="#c66074">Yes dear.</font>

2425
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,695
<font color="#B8860B">Where on earth did she come from?</font>

2426
00:49:01,784 --> 00:49:03,798
<font color="#7FFFD4">I've never seen her before.</font>

2427
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:07,736
<font color="#00b000">There's something vaguely
familiar about that girl.</font>

2428
00:49:08,751 --> 00:49:12,416
<font color="#9370db">You know I have the funniest feeling
I've met you somewhere's before.</font>

2429
00:49:12,626 --> 00:49:14,693
<font color="#ff00ff">Well I'm sure I would remember.</font>

2430
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,636
<font color="#9370db">Was it last summer at the lake?</font>

2431
00:49:17,808 --> 00:49:19,623
<font color="#ff00ff">No I can't swim.</font>

2432
00:49:20,475 --> 00:49:22,880
<font color="#9370db">Then it must have been this
winter, at the lodge.</font>

2433
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:24,338
<font color="#ff00ff">Up in the mountains?</font>

2434
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:25,864
<font color="#9370db">You go to the mountains too?</font>

2435
00:49:25,947 --> 00:49:28,553
<font color="#ff00ff">No, I just love looking at them.</font>

2436
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:30,221
<font color="#ff00ff">They're very beautiful.</font>

2437
00:49:30,924 --> 00:49:32,551

me to come here tonight.</font>

3045

3046
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:07,164
<font color="#9370db">To tell you the truth I
almost didn't come myself.</font>

3047
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:10,147
<font color="#ff00ff">Well how can the prince
not show up at his own ball?</font>

3048
00:58:10,282 --> 00:58:12,076
<font color="#9370db">Don't you think that
it's a little medieval?</font>

3049
00:58:12,277 --> 00:58:14,611
<font color="#9370db">Everyone circling around as if I were some,</font>

3050
00:58:14,814 --> 00:58:17,044
<font color="#9370db">prize bull they were trying to rope in.</font>

3051
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,386
<font color="#9370db">Go ahead and laugh but this is serious.</font>

3052
00:58:21,056 --> 00:58:23,542
<font color="#9370db">If I'm going to spend the rest
of my life with someone..</font>

3053
00:58:23,941 --> 00:58:25,022
<font color="#9370db">Well she's got to be..</font>

3054
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,298
<font color="#ff00ff">Well she's got to be, exciting.</font>

3055
00:58:27,932 --> 00:58:29,075
<font color="#9370db">I guess.</font>

3056
00:58:29,456 --> 00:58:31,679
- <font color="#ff00ff">But sweet.</font>
- <font color="#9370db">Not that sweet.</font>

3057
00:58:32,982 --> 00:58:35,840
<font color="#ff00ff">And your devoted servant forever and ever.</font>

3058
00:58:36,544 --> 00:58:38,219
<font color="#9370db">Servants I got.</font>

3059
00:58:38,773 --> 00:58:41,059
<font color="#9370db">What I need is someone
I can really talk to.</font>

3060
00:58:42,213 --> 00:58:43,760
<font color="#9370db">You know what I wish?</font>

3061
00:58:44,275 --> 00:58:45,489
<font color="#9370db">I wish..</font>

3062
00:58:45,514 --> 00:58:47,278
<font color="#ff00ff">You know the trouble with most people,</font>

3063
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:49,504
<font color="#ff00ff">is they sit around wishing
for something to happen</font>

3064
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,353
<font color="#ff00ff">instead of just doing something about it.</font>

3065
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:53,808
<font color="#9370db">You're right.</font>

3066
00:58:58,588 --> 00:59:00,374
<font color="#9370db">May I ask you a question?</font>

3067
00:59:02,113 --> 00:59:03,590
<font color="#ff00ff">Of course.</font>

3068
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:09,229
<font color="#9370db">Do you think it's possible to meet someone
and know in an instant that she's the one.</font>

3069
00:59:10,406 --> 00:59:12,263
<font color="#ff00ff">It's very possible.</font>

3070
00:59:13,736 --> 00:59:15,149
<font color="#9370db">I feel so strange.</font>

3071
00:59:15,877 --> 00:59:19,552
<font color="#9370db">Like I'm not myself , or maybe its
just with you I really am myself.</font>

3072
00:59:19,896 --> 00:59:23,293
<font color="#9370db">Not the self that people expect me
to be but the real self that I..</font>

3073
00:59:25,114 --> 00:59:26,860
<font color="#9370db">Not making any sense am I.</font>

3074
00:59:27,274 --> 00:59:29,695
<font color="#ff00ff">Actually your making perfect sense to me.</font>

3075
00:59:30,908 --> 00:59:32,758
<font color="#ff00ff">That's what so scary.</font>

3076
00:59:32,956 --> 00:59:34,273
<font color="#9370db">Scary?..</font>

3077
00:59:35,178 --> 00:59:38,233
