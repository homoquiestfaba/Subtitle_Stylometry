1
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,700
You coming or not?

2
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:40,002
- All right, I'll get her to you right away.
- Appreciate it.

3
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:42,228
- Hi.
- Hi.

4
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,704
<i>Dr. Klyczynski to ER, stat.
Dr. Klyczynski to ER, stat.</i>

5
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:50,242
- Hi, excuse me.
- Yeah, just a minute, okay?

6
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:54,972
- Fill this out for me and wait over there.
- No, I'm... I'm Dr. Forster.

7
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:56,515
I was told to report here.

8
00:03:56,686 --> 00:04:00,144
You'll be covering 22 patients
on rounds today, this floor and the next.

9
00:04:00,356 --> 00:04:01,983
- Twenty-two?
- Quiet morning.

10
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:05,058
If you get into trouble, beep me,
but don't make it a habit.

11
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,752
The med students
will help you out with scutwork.

12
00:04:07,964 --> 00:04:10,694
What's he doing here?
I ordered an MRI, stat.

13
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,461
- Transport said about four hours.
- He could be dead in four hours.

14
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,866
Never mind. Dr. Forster, MRI.

15
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,099
- A right, two lefts, elevator to two.
- Okay.

16
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,742
Follow the signs.
Hustle back here for rounds.

17
00:04:22,712 --> 00:04:24,407
Dr. Kly...

18
00:04:26,049 --> 00:04:29,507
- Are you taking me somewhere?
- I certainly hope so, sir.

19
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:32,483
- How are you feeling today?
- Am...? Am I gonna make it?

20
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:35,382
Yes. Absolutely.

21
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:41,495
Alex!

22
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:46,032
I made my famous spinach pie.
The trailer's nice and toasty.

23
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:48,100
I can't.

24
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:54,565
Look, it's really cold out here.
Don't get sick on me or anything.

25
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:57,268
I never get sick.

26
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:02,212
So I heard you bought a house,
and apparently I'm the last one to know.

27
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:03,817
I thought I mentioned that.

28
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,748
Wait.

29
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:07,719
Where?

30
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:10,222
Outside of town.
Up the shore a little bit.

31
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:12,121
Up the shore? There's no houses...

32
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:16,264
Oh, God. You don't mean that thing
with the stilts and the...?

33
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,234
- You all right?
- Yeah. Are you crazy?

34
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,269
Why would you take that house, Alex?

35
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:29,138
It's made of glass. There's no privacy.

36
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:31,006
Mona?

37
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:33,745
Get yourself some boots.

38
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:38,747
Hey, Gonzalez!

39
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,493
- Four-thirty.
- You lost?

40
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:48,755
- Yeah.
- Takes a while to get your bearings.

41
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:52,093
- I'm Madhvi.
- Kate Forster. Hi.

42
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,702
Oh, wrong floor.
Where'd you do your residency?

43
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,702
Just a little community hospital
up on the North Shore.

44
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,898
<i>Dear new tenant,
welcome to your new home.</i>

45
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,861
<i>As the previous tenant, let me say...</i>

46
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:28,036
<i>...I hope you'll like living here
as much as I did.</i>

47
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:31,331
<i>I filed the change of address
with the post office...</i>

48
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,873
<i>...but you know
what a crapshoot that can be.</i>

49
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:37,739
<i>So if anything slips through, would you
do me a favor and forward my mail?</i>

50
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,643
<i>I'd appreciate it.
My new address is below.</i>

51
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:45,685
<i>Thanks in advance. P. S:</i>

52
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:50,382
"Sorry about the paw prints by the front
door. They were there when I moved in.

53
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,886
Same with the box in the attic. "

54
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:59,997
Paw prints?
What the hell is she talking about?

55
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,519
Hey, baby girl. Hi. Hi. Hey.

56
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:30,757
Fix the light.

57
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,894
Get dog food, huh?

58
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:36,871
Get human food.

59
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,431
Hey. Hey.

60
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,470
Hey, come here.

61
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,614
Sixty degrees on Valentine's Day.
Can't be Chicago.

62
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:31,190
The TV says it's global warming.

63
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,160
The icebergs start melting,
water covers the Earth.

64
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:38,026
Thank God we won't live to see it.

65
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,868
What's this?

66
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:43,639
That's nothing.
It's one of your father's.

67
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,275
- Dostoyevsky?
- Oh, yeah.

68
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:53,947
It's about a guy who breaks the neck
of a poor woman with an axe...

69
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,950
..and, so far, keeps wandering
around regretting it.

70
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,757
This is good.

71
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,360
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. It's really good.

72
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:08,552
I'll meet you there.

73
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,163
What are you thinking?

74
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,065
My folks are coming into town.

75
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,962
Nothing.

76
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,402
When your father passed away,
it was hard. It still is hard.

77
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:23,511
Holding his books,
I feel like he's with me somehow.

78
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:26,477
Knowing that he was once
on the same pages...

79
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:28,843
..reading the same words.

80
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,685
Oh, my God!
Somebody call an ambulance!

81
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:40,055
We need an ambulance at Daley Plaza.

82
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:43,231
A man has been struck by a bus.
Get an EMT crew here. Sir...

83
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:45,297
Get out the street.
Get on the sidewalk.

84
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,298
- On the sidewalk. Off the street.
- Sir?

85
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,028
Get on the sidewalk!
Get on the sidewalk!

86
00:09:50,206 --> 00:09:53,505
I'd like to get the foundation
on number 17 dug today.

87
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,874
Look, I know you're
kind of new around here, kid.

88
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,706
What?

89
00:09:58,914 --> 00:10:02,042
I can't get to 17 until
at least next week.

90
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:05,243
Come on, Mulhern.
That's bullshit and you know it.

91
00:10:05,454 --> 00:10:07,752
Take Clemens and Rodriguez
off of roofing.

92
00:10:07,957 --> 00:10:10,619
Jorge can run the backhoe
they're not using on 14...

93
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,021
..and grab four or five
of those other guys...

94
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:15,527
..who are doing nothing
on seven and 10.

95
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:19,326
Paulie, Carlos, Frank, Danny,
and what's-his-name, the tall guy?

96
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,026
- Rafael.
- Rafael.

97
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:25,036
- Let's go.
- Okay.

98
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:26,765
- Ready?
- Yeah.

99
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:29,308
- Well, I need it to 10 and 11.
- Hey!

100
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,782
<i>Housekeeping ER
to the Suture Room, please.</i>

101
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:39,477
<i>Housekeeping ER to the Suture Room.</i>

102
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:45,087
- Hey.
- Hi.

103
00:10:45,294 --> 00:10:48,127
I heard about Daley Plaza.

104
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:51,660
EMT said you fought hard for the guy.

105
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:55,069
Yeah. Really knocked myself out.

106
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,799
<i>Kate, I'm going to tell you
what I tell every young doctor.</i>

107
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:03,001
<i>Hopefully, you'll be the first to listen.</i>

108
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:08,911
<i>On your day off, get as far away
from this place as you can.</i>

109
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:14,420
<i>Go someplace where you feel
most like yourself.</i>

110
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,438
<i>Dear Ms. Forster:</i>

111
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,978
<i>I got your note...</i>

112
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:16,447
<i>...and I'm afraid there must be
some kind of misunderstanding.</i>

113
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,588
<i>As far as I know, the lake house
has been empty for several years.</i>

114
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,350
<i>Maybe your note was intended for
the Sandburg house down the shore...</i>

115
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,052
"... since no one has lived
in this house for years.

116
00:12:29,064 --> 00:12:32,192
But I'm curious about the paw prints. "

117
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,168
<i>Dear Mr. Wyler, I'm very familiar
with the Sandburg cottage...</i>

118
00:12:41,377 --> 00:12:43,902
<i>...and I can guarantee
I never lived there.</i>

119
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:47,879
<i>I'm old-fashioned, but I don't think a
cottage should be over 6000 square feet.</i>

120
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,051
<i>So let me try again.</i>

121
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:53,415
<i>I used to live at the lake house,
then I moved.</i>

122
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:57,251
<i>Now I live at 1620 North Racine
in Chicago.</i>

123
00:12:57,493 --> 00:13:00,519
<i>I'd appreciate it if you would
forward my mail if you get any.</i>

124
00:13:00,729 --> 00:13:04,495
<i>Oh, by the way, it's 2006.</i>

125
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,294
<i>Has been all year, ask anyone.</i>

126
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,004
2006?

127
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:12,905
What does she mean, 2006?

128
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:15,544
God.

129
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:16,800
Oh, God.

130
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:22,110
- Good morning, Mr. Wyler.
- Morning, Mr. Wyler.

131
00:13:22,318 --> 00:13:23,808
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, morning.

132
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,816
Hello, Mr. Wyler.

133
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:28,290
Mr. Wyler.

134
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:30,956
Sir.

135
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,392
Well, obviously,
I derived my inspiration...

136
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:39,830
..for the metaphor
of the fugue, the loop...

137
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,331
Yeah.

138
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:06,457
- Two hours of that shit. You kidding me?
- What are you talking about?

139
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:11,190
- He didn't say a word.
- Sadistic, bitter, bitter old man.

140
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,368
I think you're being
a little overdramatic.

141
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:20,004
Where are you going?

142
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:31,149
Man, I love that place.

143
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:55,341
I can't believe that thing's
still running.

144
00:14:58,347 --> 00:14:59,974
Yep.

145
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,716
You look like shit.

146
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:05,349
I missed you too.

147
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,403
Hey, forget about him.

148
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,904
- Condos.
- Riviera Estates.

149
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:34,911
- You're joking.
- I don't believe this.

150
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,947
I come back after four years...

151
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,051
..and I get this in front of me.
- What?

152
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:41,381
My brother thinking
he's Frank Lloyd Whatever.

153
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,558
- Oh, come on.
- Dad keeps you hostage...

154
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,455
..in that little
mythmaking factory of his...

155
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:50,028
..while you haven't built so much as
a phone booth or a hamster cage.

156
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,894
That's funny you say that, actually.

157
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:55,161
I have a hamster cage in mind.
A development of them, actually.

158
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,534
Prefab, no foundations.
What do you think about that?

159
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:01,938
See, that's what I'm talking about.
You have vision.

160
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,808
Speaking of which...

161
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:08,312
..I'd like you to know
I bought a house.

162
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:10,543
- Where?
- On the lake.

163
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:12,921
A lake house.
So you are making some money.

164
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:15,579
Well, it's a dump.
Been abandoned for years, but...

165
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,055
So you got an abandoned,
haunted lake hou...

166
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,818
That's as good a reason as any...

167
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,826
..for selling out and joining
the flabby-developers' guild.

168
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,432
- How about this? I even got a dog.
- You got a dog?

169
00:16:27,636 --> 00:16:32,403
He just showed up at the house
from out of nowhere.

170
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:47,149
- What are we doing here?
- I have to deliver a letter.

171
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:51,793
It should be here.
1620 North Racine.

172
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,791
But...

173
00:16:58,133 --> 00:16:59,361
..there's nothing here.

174
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:04,768
Are we meeting someone?
Does somebody live here? What?

175
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:06,869
Yeah.

176
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,304
I thought so.

177
00:17:09,712 --> 00:17:10,940
Should we ring the bell?

178
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:31,559
<i>Dear Ms. Forster:</i>

179
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,497
<i>I went to 1620 North Racine,
and it's not there.</i>

180
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:37,895
<i>It's just a construction site.</i>

181
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,201
<i>From the pictures it looks nice,
but not for another 18 months.</i>

182
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:44,379
<i>What am I missing here?</i>

183
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,072
<i>Maybe you got the address wrong,
because you got the date wrong too.</i>

184
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,150
You really wanna play this game.

185
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:57,289
If you are truly in the year 2004...

186
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,291
..then...

187
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:04,657
..be forewarned.

188
00:18:06,401 --> 00:18:10,929
Remember that day?
You were not happy. Remember that?

189
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:13,335
I know.

190
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:16,877
<i>Okay, my mystery correspondent,
I get it.</i>

191
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,446
<i>Just in case you really are
where and when you think you are...</i>

192
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,240
<i>...you'll need this.</i>

193
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:25,750
<i>There was a freak late snow that spring
and everyone got sick.</i>

194
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:30,584
<i>So plenty of rest, lots of fluids.
Doctor's orders.</i>

195
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:33,693
Snow. Right.

196
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,336
Yeah, come to papa.

197
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,362
Jackie.

198
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:22,298
Jack.

199
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:25,832
Jack, come on. Come on, girl.
Come on, come on. Jack.

200
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,248
"Lmpossible, I know. Not possible...

201
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,682
..but it's happening. "

202
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,867
Okay.

203
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:35,804
Where am I?

204
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:42,742
Very clever.

205
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:46,778
"The lake house. "

206
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,214
The lake house. As you can see,
I, too, am at the lake house...

207
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,555
..but I'm getting tired of these games
so I'm leaving, okay? Bye.

208
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,957
Thank you. Bye.

209
00:21:57,532 --> 00:22:00,729
Maybe we should
introduce ourselves properly.

210
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:09,275
<i>I'm a doctor,
dedicated to curing the sick.</i>

211
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:11,339
<i>At least, trying to.</i>

212
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:14,813
<i>I'm an architect. I like to build.</i>

213
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,848
<i>And while I wouldn't say
my current project is ideal...</i>

214
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:23,149
<i>...it allows me to be here, in this place,
and that's enough for now.</i>

215
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:27,451
<i>But tell me something. If you're working
in a hospital in Chicago now...</i>

216
00:22:27,662 --> 00:22:30,597
<i>...where were you before, in my time?</i>

217
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:32,993
<i>Two years ago, in your time...</i>

218
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:37,297
<i>...I was working
in internal medicine in Madison.</i>

219
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:41,639
<i>Tell me about the future.</i>

220
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:45,374
<i>What's it like in the year 2006?</i>

221
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:49,445
<i>I'm afraid the world's
pretty much the same.</i>

222
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:54,645
<i>Of course, we all dress in shiny metal
jump suits and drive flying cars...</i>

223
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:58,587
<i>...and no one talks anymore
because we can read each other's minds.</i>

224
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,888
<i>But the truth is, man from the past...</i>

225
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,657
<i>...not much has really changed
in 2006.</i>

226
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:11,166
<i>Speaking of the past, though,
I've been thinking about the paw prints.</i>

227
00:23:11,373 --> 00:23:15,571
<i>- How is that possible?
- Well, I think we have the same dog.</i>

228
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:18,869
<i>Oh, yeah? What's yours like?</i>

229
00:23:19,114 --> 00:23:22,880
<i>According to the vet,
mine is eight years old in my time...</i>

230
00:23:23,118 --> 00:23:25,109
<i>...six in yours.</i>

231
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:31,115
<i>She's skinny, has sad eyes, snores,
and sleeps like a person.</i>

232
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,624
<i>I don't know why, but I call her Jack.</i>

233
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,820
Hello, Jack.

234
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,560
<i>It's nice out here.</i>

235
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,068
<i>Let's not go out for dinner.
Let's stay here.</i>

236
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:47,207
<i>- Hey.
- We have to eat.</i>

237
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:50,003
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be asleep.

238
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:51,572
<i>I'll cook.</i>

239
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,641
<i>I thought you didn't like to cook.</i>

240
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,545
<i>No, I don't like to cook.</i>

241
00:23:57,752 --> 00:23:59,777
Is she gonna marry him?

242
00:23:59,955 --> 00:24:03,584
- What do you think?
- I don't know. He's kind of old.

243
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:06,955
<i>- Where are you going?
- Okay, he's not that old.</i>

244
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,360
My mom's last boyfriend was bald.

245
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:11,464
He was nice...

246
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:14,431
..but my mom didn't marry him.
- No?

247
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:17,536
"There's always something better
coming around the corner. "

248
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:20,105
That's what she says.

249
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,103
Maybe that's what that lady should do.
Wait for something better...

250
00:24:24,312 --> 00:24:27,281
..to come around the corner.
- Maybe.

251
00:24:29,284 --> 00:24:33,050
But if she's not careful,
she could spend her whole life waiting.

252
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:36,321
<i>Do you want me to bring
anything back with me?</i>

253
00:24:36,491 --> 00:24:39,119
<i>Yes. What about
a nice bottle of wine...</i>

254
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,453
<i>...to celebrate?</i>

255
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:44,722
<i>- What time shall I come back?
- Seven o'clock.</i>

256
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:47,697
<i>Sorry I haven't made it
to the mailbox lately.</i>

257
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,839
<i>It's been a long week. All night shifts.</i>

258
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:55,201
<i>Good to hear from you.
I thought you left me.</i>

259
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,141
<i>You should know that you're
my only connection to the future.</i>

260
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:03,012
<i>How come we never talk
about the things we like?</i>

261
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:06,843
<i>Well, let's see.
Reading the classics to Jack.</i>

262
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:10,216
<i>- Who's his favorite?
- Dostoyevsky.</i>

263
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:14,088
<i>For me, this city,
on a day when the light is so clear...</i>

264
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:15,923
<i>...that I can touch every detail...</i>

265
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:18,793
<i>...every brick and window
in the buildings I love.</i>

266
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,596
<i>Come on, take a walk with me
this Saturday. Let me show you.</i>

267
00:25:23,805 --> 00:25:27,241
<i>You're crazy. Why are you going
through all this trouble for me?</i>

268
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,468
<i>No trouble. Summer's here.</i>

269
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:46,787
<i>Okay, your turn. Favorite things.</i>

270
00:25:46,995 --> 00:25:49,828
<i>Where to start? Okay.</i>

271
00:25:50,031 --> 00:25:53,125
<i>When I smell the flowers
before I see them.</i>

272
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:57,635
<i>When it starts to rain
just as the picnic is ending.</i>

273
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:01,707
<i>And I love the smell of Jack's paws.</i>

274
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,538
<i>You didn't forget
to mention your husband, did you?</i>

275
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,007
<i>Well, of course I love my husband,
who is also a doctor.</i>

276
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:11,651
<i>Plastic surgeon
for small farm animals.</i>

277
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:14,151
<i>Good. I'm married too.</i>

278
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:17,814
<i>I've got eight children,
and none of them look like me.</i>

279
00:26:18,026 --> 00:26:21,189
<i>- I'm worried, Kate.
- I would be too.</i>

280
00:26:21,596 --> 00:26:22,995
<i>I'm single.</i>

281
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,595
<i>Me too.</i>

282
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,501
<i>Number 27.</i>

283
00:26:30,705 --> 00:26:32,866
<i>She's a beauty.
My father used to tell me...</i>

284
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:35,941
<i>...she was the grandma
for all the houses in the city.</i>

285
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:39,613
<i>He used to take me on walks
like I'm taking you now.</i>

286
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:43,313
<i>- Alex?
- Kate?</i>

287
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,351
<i>I wish we could have
done this walk together.</i>

288
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:03,233
So, what do you think?

289
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,972
He sounds like a nice boy.

290
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:08,837
Sounds like a nice boy.
Anything else?

291
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,377
- He has wonderful penmanship.
- Mother...

292
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,947
..look at the date on the letter.
The date.

293
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,640
- You mean the time thing?
- Yes.

294
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,479
- That's just a detail.
- Just a detail?

295
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,657
About the...
The other day...

296
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,769
..it was not a good moment.
I was in a hell of a hurry.

297
00:27:37,105 --> 00:27:38,732
Of course.

298
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:42,302
You've got some nice pieces here.

299
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:46,310
Oh, yeah. Music's fine, music helps.

300
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:48,676
It's like Nietzsche says:

301
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,182
- "Life would be senseless... "
- "Without music. "

302
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,988
I guess I told you that, huh?

303
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,623
Pour yourself a drink.

304
00:27:56,825 --> 00:28:00,090
Can you appreciate
a good wine by now?

305
00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:02,195
You bet.

306
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:06,125
You know, you'll have to forgive
your father for being curious...

307
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:09,497
..but where have you been
all these years?

308
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:13,103
I thought your Kerouac days
were behind you.

309
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,907
- I'm sorry, what?
- What?

310
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:20,637
Oh, you can come up, if you like.

311
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:30,984
What are you working on?

312
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:34,219
Oh, I'm just...
I'm just remembering things.

313
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,124
It's not such an easy job,
let me tell you.

314
00:28:37,332 --> 00:28:40,301
Nor is it particularly innocent,
in my case.

315
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:43,869
Your father is writing his memoirs.

316
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:47,234
- Are we in it?
- What do you think?

317
00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:49,172
Do you wanna be?

318
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,710
Do you?

319
00:28:51,946 --> 00:28:55,541
Of course.
You were all a part of your father's life.

320
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,911
Why are you talking to me
in the third person?

321
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:00,748
Well, I... I don't...

322
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,322
Because I'm writing about myself,
I suppose. Why, doesn't it suit you?

323
00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:10,687
I thought you might like these.

324
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,898
What are these?
Something you've been working on?

325
00:29:15,103 --> 00:29:17,970
No, they're... They're yours.

326
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:22,234
From a house I just bought
on the lake.

327
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,009
Oh, yes, I heard. They said
some sleazy little condo developer...

328
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:29,206
..had snapped it up.

329
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:32,849
Oh, come on. Indulge your father.

330
00:29:33,054 --> 00:29:36,046
Can't you take a little joke,
for God's sake?

331
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:38,188
Come on.

332
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,088
Tell me.

333
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:42,757
Where have you been?
I really want to know.

334
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:45,488
I was trying to forget you.

335
00:29:47,235 --> 00:29:49,567
Or forgive you.

336
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:53,066
Did you succeed?

337
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,071
No.

338
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:04,442
Let me know
if you need any help remembering.

339
00:30:06,454 --> 00:30:09,514
Oh, yeah, I will.

340
00:30:10,291 --> 00:30:13,920
Charging 360. Get 1 milligram of epi.
Have 300 amio ready in case we need it.

341
00:30:14,128 --> 00:30:16,756
- All clear?
- Clear.

342
00:30:18,933 --> 00:30:21,026
Hold compression, start bagging.

343
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,533
He's got a rhythm. Slow.

344
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,331
- Do we have a pulse with that?
- We got a pulse, thready.

345
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,473
<i>- It's getting stronger.
- Long days, these days.</i>

346
00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:30,405
<i>I just worked 30 hours straight.</i>

347
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:33,103
<i>Every time I stop to take a breath...</i>

348
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:36,579
<i>...I realize how isolated
I've let myself become.</i>

349
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:41,688
<i>Believe me,
you can get a bit desperate.</i>

350
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:45,792
That one? Okay. There you go.

351
00:30:45,994 --> 00:30:50,192
Nice move. Very nice. Nice.

352
00:30:52,834 --> 00:30:55,860
<i>It's not that I'm complaining,
I love my work.</i>

353
00:30:56,104 --> 00:31:00,438
<i>And our tour through Chicago
opened my eyes to its beauty.</i>

354
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:03,577
<i>But my heart still misses
the lake house...</i>

355
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,973
<i>...and its trees.</i>

356
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,509
<i>I miss those trees so much.</i>

357
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:30,288
<i>Don't worry, Kate.
We'll be together in time.</i>

358
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,864
<i>Even if we're far apart,
I'll find a way to be close to you...</i>

359
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:36,093
<i>...and take care of you.</i>

360
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:43,273
Katerina.

361
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,475
Take this.

362
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:49,815
- You should eat more. You too skinny.
- I'm not too skinny.

363
00:32:49,984 --> 00:32:53,249
Remember how you used to eat
when you were little?

364
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:55,183
- With your hands.
- Yes, I remember.

365
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,223
Now, did you or did you not
write to each other?

366
00:32:58,593 --> 00:33:00,493
- To your father?
- No, to Clark Gable.

367
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:03,322
Yes, to Dad.

368
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:07,496
I...

369
00:33:09,937 --> 00:33:11,461
What, Mom?

370
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:13,697
Before your father...

371
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,637
Yeah?

372
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:20,709
There was this boy.

373
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,117
Did you love him?

374
00:33:24,952 --> 00:33:26,681
Yeah.

375
00:33:32,026 --> 00:33:34,620
Well, why didn't you marry him?

376
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:39,831
So that you could ask me
this question someday.

377
00:33:49,977 --> 00:33:52,036
Looks smaller.

378
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:56,245
When did he complete it?

379
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,845
You weren't born yet,
and I was 8.

380
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,619
Corbusier meets Frank Lloyd Wright.

381
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:11,321
You know, Dad played cards
with both of them.

382
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,858
- Sharing a joint.
- Yeah, well...

383
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,405
Can't swim.

384
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:22,470
There should be a stairway
down to the water, a porch, a deck.

385
00:34:23,044 --> 00:34:25,512
Here, you're in a...
In a box.

386
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:28,978
A glass box with a view
to everything that's around you...

387
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:30,650
..but you can't touch it.

388
00:34:30,852 --> 00:34:35,186
No interconnection
between you and what you're looking at.

389
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:38,222
I don't know, you know.
He's got this big maple growing...

390
00:34:38,426 --> 00:34:41,418
..right in the middle of the house.
- Containment.

391
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:48,495
Containment and control.

392
00:34:50,304 --> 00:34:54,331
This house is about ownership,
not connection.

393
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:58,742
I mean, it's beautiful. Seductive, even.

394
00:34:58,946 --> 00:35:01,915
But it's incomplete.

395
00:35:04,218 --> 00:35:06,049
It was all about him.

396
00:35:07,722 --> 00:35:10,122
Dad knew how to build a house,
not a home.

397
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,456
But you know...

398
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,628
..I think he wants us to do
what he couldn't.

399
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,423
But admitting that...

400
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:23,194
..would mean admitting
that he came up short in some way...

401
00:35:23,404 --> 00:35:25,269
..that he could do more.

402
00:35:25,473 --> 00:35:27,532
And that tortures him.

403
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,367
Do you remember
being here with Mom?

404
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,278
I remember she tried
to make it work here...

405
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,421
..with us...

406
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,650
..with him.

407
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:49,456
Hey, what about Visionary Vanguard?

408
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,258
- What about it?
- Come on.

409
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:56,301
You can't convince me you're gonna
be happy building saltboxes for tourists.

410
00:35:56,804 --> 00:35:59,068
Nobody's gonna admire you for that.

411
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:02,333
- Admire me for that?
- Yeah, Visionary Vanguard.

412
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,101
That's your idea.

413
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:07,144
I can't. But you can keep the name.

414
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:09,476
No, come on.
It's gotta be you and me.

415
00:36:09,684 --> 00:36:12,448
Henry, I'm sorry, I can't.

416
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:14,143
I just...

417
00:36:14,388 --> 00:36:17,585
- What?
- I've got other plans.

418
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,783
You have a girlfriend?

419
00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:22,687
No...

420
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:24,627
No.

421
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:28,127
- What is that? You hesitated.
- No, I didn't hesitate.

422
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,337
Come on, man.
I don't have any time for that.

423
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:35,900
What does time have to do with it?

424
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:39,043
Oh, you're gonna think I'm crazy.

425
00:36:43,985 --> 00:36:46,419
<i>My dearest Mr. Wyler:</i>

426
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:49,351
<i>Are you willing to play a game
with me?</i>

427
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:53,222
<i>Two years ago today,
I was taking the 145 train to Madison...</i>

428
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,828
<i>...from the Riverside station
and I forgot something there.</i>

429
00:36:57,031 --> 00:36:59,556
<i>It was a gift from my father.</i>

430
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:04,027
<i>If you find it,
can you please put it in the mailbox?</i>

431
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:07,166
<i>It would mean a lot.</i>

432
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,706
<i>Yours, Kate.</i>

433
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,454
- Final call for the 5:46 to Madison.
- Do you really wanna know? Come on.

434
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,861
- All aboard.
- Okay.

435
00:37:43,978 --> 00:37:45,570
I'll call you.

436
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,254
<i>Kate, I found it. I have it with me.</i>

437
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:33,154
<i>One day I'll get it to you. Trust me.</i>

438
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,386
<i>I know how important it is to you.</i>

439
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:41,101
<i>You might not remember,
but we saw each other.</i>

440
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:43,395
<i>At least, I saw you.</i>

441
00:38:44,638 --> 00:38:48,802
<i>You never told me
how beautiful you are.</i>

442
00:38:49,043 --> 00:38:51,534
<i>Well, maybe you saw somebody else.</i>

443
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,237
<i>That was a bad hair year for me.</i>

444
00:38:54,448 --> 00:38:57,781
<i>Long brown hair.
Gentle, unguarded eyes.</i>

445
00:38:57,985 --> 00:38:59,850
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

446
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,918
<i>You saw me.</i>

447
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,751
<i>But I still don't know
what you look like.</i>

448
00:39:06,327 --> 00:39:09,785
<i>Well, why don't we just get together
in the future...</i>

449
00:39:09,997 --> 00:39:12,659
<i>...and you can let me know
what you think.</i>

450
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:15,431
It's a date.

451
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,129
Okay.

452
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:24,675
Why don't you call me
July 10th, 2006...

453
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:30,112
..at 9:05 p. m.

454
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,165
<i>- Hello.
- Kate?</i>

455
00:39:47,368 --> 00:39:50,201
<i>- Yes.
- It's Morgan.</i>

456
00:39:53,107 --> 00:39:54,699
Morgan.

457
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:57,810
<i>I'm in Chicago. I came for a meeting,
but it was canceled...</i>

458
00:39:58,012 --> 00:39:59,741
<i>...so I thought I'd give you a call.</i>

459
00:40:00,548 --> 00:40:02,675
Hey, have you eaten?

460
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:06,375
- No, but I'm not...
- Neither have I. I realized I'm starving.

461
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,180
- We could grab a quick bite.
- Okay.

462
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,255
- Yeah?
- All right.

463
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:15,121
- Hey, wait up.
- Watch out, man.

464
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:18,193
- All right.
- Looks pretty good.

465
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:19,866
- Perfect.
- No, Morgan, it's...

466
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:21,398
- It's not.
- No, no, trust me.

467
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:24,103
It's... Okay.

468
00:40:25,573 --> 00:40:26,835
Hi there.

469
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:29,202
One sec.
Could you hold on for a moment?

470
00:40:29,376 --> 00:40:31,776
- We'd love a table for two.
- The name?

471
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:35,512
We don't...
We don't have a reservation.

472
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,618
I'm sorry, sir,
we're booked until October.

473
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:40,845
October?

474
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:44,953
Well...

475
00:40:45,593 --> 00:40:47,754
..I'll get back to you.

476
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,062
That went well.

477
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:54,530
It's no big deal.

478
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,938
Oh, come on, stop it.

479
00:41:00,107 --> 00:41:03,042
It's the best restaurant in town.
Nobody gets a table here.

480
00:41:03,244 --> 00:41:06,771
- No, it's not that.
- Well, what is it?

481
00:41:10,284 --> 00:41:12,377
I didn't do this right.

482
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:16,412
- There wasn't a meeting.
- You'd see me if there was no big deal.

483
00:41:16,624 --> 00:41:17,716
- Lf it was just...
- Ambush.

484
00:41:17,925 --> 00:41:20,758
- You know, coffee,
and coffee can turn into dinner...

485
00:41:20,928 --> 00:41:23,419
..dinner can turn into...
- Turn into what?

486
00:41:23,597 --> 00:41:25,827
I do sometimes
get a few steps ahead of myself.

487
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:31,129
Morgan, a few steps?
You're always leaping 10 steps ahead.

488
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,430
We were dating, what, a week?

489
00:41:34,642 --> 00:41:37,577
And you had our entire future
mapped out for us?

490
00:41:38,345 --> 00:41:41,837
In my residency, you were picking out
real estate. I'd go to your house...

491
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:45,347
..you'd have the entire town
in your house to meet me.

492
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:49,420
I do seem to remember that you made
pretty fast friends with one of them.

493
00:41:49,623 --> 00:41:50,851
What are you talking about?

494
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,524
You know what
I'm talking about.

495
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,749
- That guy.
- What guy?

496
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:57,328
- The guy I caught you making out with.
- I wasn't making out with him.

497
00:41:57,531 --> 00:41:59,624
What, are we in junior high school
right now?

498
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:01,824
What do you call it, then?

499
00:42:02,036 --> 00:42:04,630
A kiss.

500
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:08,865
It was just one kiss
with some random guy that just...

501
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,440
Years... You know what?

502
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,169
Gentlemen...

503
00:42:12,379 --> 00:42:16,975
..unit 381 on Riviera Estates
is complete.

504
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:21,686
Congratulations.
You did a good job.

505
00:42:23,824 --> 00:42:26,793
- One down...
- Forty-four to go.

506
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:31,328
We're not terrifyingly behind schedule,
just alarmingly.

507
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:34,262
It'll be okay.
The guys are getting to know their job...

508
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,698
..but we could use
another backhoe.

509
00:42:36,904 --> 00:42:38,804
And the water on 14
needs to be resealed.

510
00:42:39,006 --> 00:42:40,496
Shut up.

511
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:43,871
- What?
- I'm kind of disappointed in you.

512
00:42:44,078 --> 00:42:47,377
- Why?
- You're supposed to be on top of things.

513
00:42:47,581 --> 00:42:51,312
- I thought I was.
- Well, you never noticed these.

514
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:54,146
Remember?
You told me to get them.

515
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,853
Right, right.

516
00:42:56,523 --> 00:42:58,388
Not exactly what I had in mind, but...

517
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,056
- You like them?
- I like them.

518
00:43:01,295 --> 00:43:06,232
I think we should go out. Tonight.
If you're not doing any...

519
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,595
Jack? Jack.

520
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,201
Hey, Jack.

521
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:15,572
Jack!

522
00:43:16,043 --> 00:43:18,034
Come on, Jack!

523
00:43:18,445 --> 00:43:21,175
Alex, wait for me!

524
00:43:21,815 --> 00:43:23,680
Jack!

525
00:43:27,755 --> 00:43:29,689
Jack!

526
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,086
Jack!

527
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,338
Jack!

528
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,148
- Yours, I take it?
- Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Thanks.

529
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,715
Come here, Jack.

530
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,946
What were you thinking, huh, girl?
What were you thinking?

531
00:44:02,122 --> 00:44:05,114
- She's never run off like that.
- You gotta keep an eye on them.

532
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,418
- What's his name?
- Her. Jack.

533
00:44:07,628 --> 00:44:09,721
Jack. It's a good name for a girl.

534
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,923
I should get one like you
for my girlfriend. She loves dogs.

535
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:15,795
- Hey, have we met before?
- No, don't think so.

536
00:44:16,003 --> 00:44:19,131
- Morgan Price.
- Alex Wyler.

537
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,465
- Hey, man, you need a hand with this?
- Yeah.

538
00:44:21,675 --> 00:44:23,074
- Okay.
- Lived here long?

539
00:44:23,277 --> 00:44:25,507
Just a few months.
I've got a place on the lake.

540
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,080
- The lake, really? I've been thinking...
- Alex. Oh, good.

541
00:44:29,983 --> 00:44:32,474
- Thank God you found him.
- Yeah.

542
00:44:32,686 --> 00:44:34,654
Mona, Morgan. Morgan, Mona.

543
00:44:34,888 --> 00:44:36,879
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

544
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,184
- It's good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

545
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,825
Nice boots there.

546
00:44:41,028 --> 00:44:43,929
Just so you don't think
I'm gonna drink all this by myself...

547
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:47,828
..I'm having friends over tonight for
a party. You two are welcome to come.

548
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,793
Oh, hey, Alex.

549
00:44:51,905 --> 00:44:53,770
Take my card. I might be looking...

550
00:44:53,974 --> 00:44:56,272
..to rent a place on the lake myself.
- Okay.

551
00:44:56,477 --> 00:44:59,708
It's Kate, my girlfriend,
she's never really liked this place...

552
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:04,281
..and I promised we'd look for something
new once she finishes her residency.

553
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,351
So if you hear of anything...

554
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:10,290
- Sure. She's a doctor?
- Yeah.

555
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,990
Alex.

556
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,934
- Great to meet you, Morgan.
- Great to meet you.

557
00:45:24,938 --> 00:45:27,702
Hey, Morgan,
what time's that party at?

558
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:31,072
Eight o'clock. It's Kate's birthday.

559
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:38,378
It's Kate birthday.

560
00:45:38,585 --> 00:45:40,553
Come on, Jack.

561
00:46:07,548 --> 00:46:08,537
- Hi.
- Hi.

562
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:11,741
- What can I get you?
- Glass of white wine, please.

563
00:46:20,894 --> 00:46:23,226
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

564
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:46,112
According to most accepted
social norms...

565
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,450
..a person should not drink alone
after 10 p. M...

566
00:46:50,657 --> 00:46:53,057
..unless they have a good excuse.

567
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,228
What's yours?

568
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,792
Gosh, don't have one.

569
00:46:58,031 --> 00:46:59,760
I do.

570
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,160
My youngest left for college
this morning.

571
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,166
Marie.

572
00:47:05,439 --> 00:47:09,000
One day she's splashing
around a wading pool in diapers...

573
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:13,476
..then she's packing up a Volvo
and driving to California.

574
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:17,747
I just hope she knows
what she's getting into.

575
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,609
Don't tell me.

576
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,788
- Premed?
- Bingo.

577
00:47:25,058 --> 00:47:27,925
- Hey, how are you? Good to see you.
- I'm well, thanks.

578
00:47:28,128 --> 00:47:30,119
I want you to meet
some friends of mine.

579
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:33,128
Alex, Mona, the Wootch.

580
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,029
- Susan, Johnny.
- Hi.

581
00:47:35,202 --> 00:47:38,000
Let's get you something to drink.
Come on. Bar's back here.

582
00:47:38,205 --> 00:47:40,366
Come on.
Hey, this is Marjorie.

583
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:42,669
Why didn't you mention it was today?

584
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:45,003
We would have had a cake for you
or something.

585
00:47:45,212 --> 00:47:47,112
Oh, it's just time passing.

586
00:47:47,314 --> 00:47:49,339
I hate making a big deal out of it.

587
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:51,881
You keep a lot to yourself.

588
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,314
Nothing wrong with it.

589
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:59,217
But I've sometimes wondered what else
you have in your life besides work.

590
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,359
Family? Boyfriend?

591
00:48:01,595 --> 00:48:04,189
Well, I did. Once.

592
00:48:04,598 --> 00:48:07,123
<i>His name was Morgan.</i>

593
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:09,632
<i>Morgan? Morgan.</i>

594
00:48:09,836 --> 00:48:12,134
<i>That's a sexy name.</i>

595
00:48:14,241 --> 00:48:16,835
Surprise!

596
00:48:20,847 --> 00:48:23,179
Happy birthday, Kate.

597
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,650
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

598
00:48:28,722 --> 00:48:31,555
We got you.

599
00:48:31,725 --> 00:48:34,387
- This is Kate, obviously.
- Hi, Kate.

600
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:40,665
This is Alex and Mona.

601
00:48:41,435 --> 00:48:42,424
- Hi.
- Hi.

602
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,762
This guy's gonna help us
find our lake house.

603
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,366
Right?

604
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,867
You haven't had cake.

605
00:48:51,044 --> 00:48:53,444
<i>Anyway, well, I ended it.</i>

606
00:48:53,614 --> 00:48:57,778
And I'm happy now,
and it was the right thing to do.

607
00:48:58,552 --> 00:49:01,953
So who is it you write to?

608
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,352
I couldn't help... Every time you get
a break at the hospital...

609
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:08,392
..you're writing something.
- There is someone.

610
00:49:08,562 --> 00:49:11,963
It's kind of
a long-distance relationship.

611
00:49:12,299 --> 00:49:14,233
- How did you meet?
- We haven't.

612
00:49:14,434 --> 00:49:16,095
- What?
- No.

613
00:49:16,303 --> 00:49:18,464
- The story of my life.
- You're kidding.

614
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:21,107
Keep everything at a distance.

615
00:49:21,308 --> 00:49:23,435
Everyone.

616
00:49:23,677 --> 00:49:25,542
The man who was standing
in front of me...

617
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,475
..the one that wanted to marry me...

618
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:30,114
..him, I push away. I run from him.

619
00:49:30,283 --> 00:49:33,218
In the meantime, the...

620
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,548
The one man I can never meet...

621
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:41,718
..him, I would like to give
my whole heart to.

622
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:46,558
He must write one hell of a letter.

623
00:49:47,134 --> 00:49:49,068
It's nice.

624
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,102
It's safe.

625
00:49:52,305 --> 00:49:54,637
- Christ, he's in prison, isn't he?
- No.

626
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:56,968
- You're one of those women, aren't you?
- No.

627
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:01,476
No, he's just a guy who lives on a lake.
He's an architect.

628
00:50:24,504 --> 00:50:26,438
Oh, my God.

629
00:50:32,312 --> 00:50:34,371
Happy birthday.

630
00:50:36,183 --> 00:50:37,980
Thank you.

631
00:50:38,685 --> 00:50:42,280
- I hope it's a great year for you.
- Thank you.

632
00:50:44,324 --> 00:50:46,121
I'm Alex.

633
00:50:47,194 --> 00:50:48,491
The lake-house guy.

634
00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:51,289
Oh, yeah. How you doing?

635
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,502
May I?

636
00:51:12,886 --> 00:51:15,878
So you're gonna... You're gonna
find us a place on the lake, huh?

637
00:51:16,089 --> 00:51:17,386
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

638
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:18,922
If I can.

639
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,024
You're a real-estate agent?

640
00:51:21,228 --> 00:51:25,221
No, I...
I just have a lake house.

641
00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:27,425
Is it nice?

642
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:31,103
Yeah, you'll love it.
You're gonna rent it after I move out.

643
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,600
Oh, really?

644
00:51:37,444 --> 00:51:40,709
Kate, have you...

645
00:51:41,414 --> 00:51:43,609
<i>...read Persuasion?</i>

646
00:51:47,454 --> 00:51:48,751
What?

647
00:51:48,955 --> 00:51:51,719
- By Jane Austen.
- I know who it's by.

648
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:55,859
Yeah, it's...
It's my favorite book.

649
00:51:56,062 --> 00:51:59,395
Why did you bring something like that up?
What made you bring that up?

650
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,366
I just... A friend of mine gave it
to me recently, and I was wondering...

651
00:52:04,938 --> 00:52:06,872
..what it was about.

652
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,634
It's... It's wonderful.

653
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,401
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

654
00:52:12,612 --> 00:52:14,705
It's about...

655
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:17,714
About waiting.

656
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:23,078
These two people, they...
They... They meet.

657
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:27,488
They almost fall in love,
but the timing isn't right.

658
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,957
They... They have to part.

659
00:52:30,263 --> 00:52:32,094
And then...

660
00:52:32,499 --> 00:52:34,433
..years later, they...
They meet again.

661
00:52:34,634 --> 00:52:36,932
They get another chance.

662
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:42,369
You know, but they don't know
if too much time has passed.

663
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,306
If they waited too long, if it's...

664
00:52:45,512 --> 00:52:49,812
..you know,
too late to make it work.

665
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,988
Why do you like that?

666
00:52:56,189 --> 00:52:58,089
I don't know.

667
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:00,657
Don't get me wrong.
It's beautiful in a kind of...

668
00:53:00,894 --> 00:53:03,954
- No, it's terrible.
- It's terrible.

669
00:53:04,164 --> 00:53:07,429
- That's terrible.
- It's terrible.

670
00:53:07,667 --> 00:53:09,259
That's...

671
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:12,165
Yeah, it's... That's terrible.

672
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:15,437
It's a personal question...

673
00:53:15,642 --> 00:53:19,976
..but have you ever been
through anything like that?

674
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:23,047
- Me? No. No, no.
- No.

675
00:53:28,989 --> 00:53:30,820
When I was...

676
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,688
When I was 16...

677
00:53:35,228 --> 00:53:38,994
..I was completely in love
with this guy.

678
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,991
He played guitar...

679
00:53:43,036 --> 00:53:44,867
..and I ran away from home...

680
00:53:45,071 --> 00:53:48,632
..and went to San Francisco
so I could go live with him.

681
00:53:49,843 --> 00:53:53,074
Yeah, he convinced me
I had a beautiful voice...

682
00:53:54,547 --> 00:53:57,345
..and I dreamed of becoming a singer.

683
00:53:59,052 --> 00:54:00,679
I love San Francisco.

684
00:54:00,887 --> 00:54:03,822
Yeah, he was...
He was my first love.

685
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:07,490
Probably the only one.

686
00:54:09,029 --> 00:54:13,159
- He must have been a great guy.
- I don't... I don't know, I...

687
00:54:13,466 --> 00:54:16,697
He may have been. It didn't last
long enough for me to find out.

688
00:54:16,903 --> 00:54:19,701
Yeah. Truth is, I...

689
00:54:19,973 --> 00:54:22,840
I can't even remember
what he looked like.

690
00:54:23,376 --> 00:54:25,071
- Really?
- Yeah.

691
00:54:25,278 --> 00:54:26,973
Then that's too bad.

692
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,513
My dad... My dad showed up, actually.

693
00:54:30,717 --> 00:54:32,241
- You were in trouble.
- He came in.

694
00:54:32,485 --> 00:54:36,012
Yeah, I was in trouble.
He yanked me back to Chicago.

695
00:54:36,423 --> 00:54:38,186
Yeah.

696
00:54:39,225 --> 00:54:41,716
And he was sick, and he...

697
00:54:41,928 --> 00:54:46,991
He had these... These dreams
of me becoming a doctor, you know?

698
00:54:49,636 --> 00:54:53,595
You know, and eventually,
they became my dreams too.

699
00:54:56,743 --> 00:54:58,643
He was right.

700
00:54:59,813 --> 00:55:02,907
You know, I...
I feel good helping people.

701
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,383
Then he died.

702
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,261
Kate.

703
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:23,398
What?

704
00:55:31,644 --> 00:55:33,771
I...

705
00:55:36,282 --> 00:55:38,273
You?

706
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:46,315
I just...

707
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,186
What?

708
00:55:52,465 --> 00:55:54,558
Do you know this song?

709
00:55:56,803 --> 00:55:58,464
Yeah.

710
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:06,101
- Do you sing?
- No.

711
00:56:06,312 --> 00:56:09,509
Nobody wants to hear me sing.
You don't wanna hear me sing.

712
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:13,512
L... I didn't mean, you know...

713
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,946
But, yeah.

714
00:56:22,095 --> 00:56:24,222
But I can dance.

715
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,428
Kate.

716
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,631
Hey.

717
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:54,341
Alex was... Alex was just telling me
about the... The lake house.

718
00:58:55,982 --> 00:58:59,816
- Yeah, it sounds... Sounds really great.
- Great.

719
00:59:00,853 --> 00:59:02,821
Alex, it's late.

720
00:59:04,524 --> 00:59:06,287
Yeah.

721
00:59:06,492 --> 00:59:08,153
Yeah.

722
00:59:08,828 --> 00:59:11,353
- Good night.
- Good night.

723
00:59:25,272 --> 00:59:26,261
It was you.

724
00:59:26,473 --> 00:59:28,839
- You working tomorrow night?
- Yeah.

725
00:59:29,042 --> 00:59:30,976
Why didn't you say anything?

726
00:59:31,177 --> 00:59:35,079
You would've thought
I was crazy or drunk. Or both.

727
00:59:35,315 --> 00:59:37,044
Yeah, but...

728
00:59:37,817 --> 00:59:40,217
..I liked you.
You should have said something.

729
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,287
How? You were with your boyfriend.

730
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:46,391
You know what? Excuses, excuses.
You are a coward.

731
00:59:46,593 --> 00:59:48,493
I'm not a coward.

732
00:59:48,695 --> 00:59:52,597
Oh, really?
Well, what about your girlfriend?

733
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:54,930
What? I told you already...

734
00:59:55,168 --> 00:59:58,296
..she's not my girlfriend.
- He's not my boyfriend either.

735
00:59:58,538 --> 01:00:02,201
Oh, really? Well, what is he, then?
Your brother?

736
01:00:03,076 --> 01:00:08,013
We have a comedian. What'd you have,
a clown for breakfast this morning?

737
01:00:09,683 --> 01:00:11,742
Wonderful. Our first fight.

738
01:00:11,951 --> 01:00:15,910
You could write a song about it
and go sing it in San Francisco.

739
01:00:20,193 --> 01:00:21,956
What?

740
01:00:22,362 --> 01:00:23,829
Hello.

741
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,964
Hey, Henry.

742
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,731
What?

743
01:00:28,902 --> 01:00:30,767
You'll let me know if you need anything?

744
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:32,767
Yes, I will.

745
01:00:34,107 --> 01:00:35,096
- Hi.
- Good afternoon.

746
01:00:35,342 --> 01:00:39,073
I'm looking for my father. I don't know
which room he's in. Simon Wyler?

747
01:00:39,279 --> 01:00:42,077
- Mr. Wyler, the architect?
- Yes.

748
01:00:42,282 --> 01:00:45,410
I'm Anna Klyczynski.
I'm the Attending for your father.

749
01:00:45,618 --> 01:00:47,779
Hey. What happened? How is he?

750
01:00:47,987 --> 01:00:52,481
He's okay. He's had a heart attack.
Fortunately, relatively minor.

751
01:00:52,726 --> 01:00:55,889
His vitals are fine and he's stable...

752
01:00:56,062 --> 01:00:58,155
..but it will require an intervention.

753
01:00:58,398 --> 01:01:01,424
He's agreed to schedule it
for tomorrow.

754
01:01:16,449 --> 01:01:19,145
Good to see you're taking it easy.

755
01:01:19,953 --> 01:01:24,014
Well, you... You didn't need to come.
I'm perfectly well.

756
01:01:24,391 --> 01:01:26,450
Perfectly all right.

757
01:01:26,659 --> 01:01:29,093
Well, you had a heart attack, Dad.

758
01:01:29,295 --> 01:01:32,628
I had an episode, for chrissake.

759
01:01:32,832 --> 01:01:34,766
Nothing more.

760
01:01:35,468 --> 01:01:38,801
Appreciate it if you kept everything
in its perspective.

761
01:01:41,007 --> 01:01:44,408
Well then, I just wanna let you know
I'm here if you need anything.

762
01:01:46,546 --> 01:01:48,343
Coffee.

763
01:01:48,782 --> 01:01:50,477
What?

764
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:52,714
You heard me.

765
01:01:55,121 --> 01:01:56,952
Coffee.

766
01:01:58,792 --> 01:02:01,022
<i>There's something
I never told you, Kate.</i>

767
01:02:01,227 --> 01:02:03,695
<i>You see, it was my father
who built the lake house.</i>

768
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:06,956
<i>I mean, with his own hands.</i>

769
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:10,000
<i>And it was a long time ago,
before he was famous...</i>

770
01:02:10,203 --> 01:02:13,434
<i>...when he still had a family
and worshipped my mother.</i>

771
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:17,440
<i>Her name was Mary,
and the house was a gift for her.</i>

772
01:02:17,644 --> 01:02:20,477
<i>She was smart and funny.</i>

773
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,343
<i>She could have done anything, but chose
to take care of my brother and I...</i>

774
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:26,348
<i>...and help him build his career.</i>

775
01:02:26,553 --> 01:02:30,580
<i>You see, the more successful he became,
the more impossible he was to live with.</i>

776
01:02:30,824 --> 01:02:34,385
<i>Finally, she just couldn't take
living with him anymore.</i>

777
01:02:34,594 --> 01:02:37,529
<i>She left him.</i>

778
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:39,857
<i>Within a year, she got sick.</i>

779
01:02:40,066 --> 01:02:43,729
<i>Unfortunately, she never learned
how to stop loving him.</i>

780
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:47,371
<i>He wasn't at the funeral.</i>

781
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:50,972
<i>When I asked him why...</i>

782
01:02:56,716 --> 01:02:59,514
Go on, Alex. What did he say?

783
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:07,221
He said, "She was dead to me the
moment she stepped out of the house. "

784
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:14,530
And then he gave me
one of his architect-of-the-year grins.

785
01:03:29,549 --> 01:03:30,811
I hope you appreciate this.

786
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,780
I had to sneak past
three nurses and your Attending.

787
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,318
Oh, jeez, it's hot.

788
01:03:36,656 --> 01:03:38,055
It's not decaf, is it?

789
01:03:38,258 --> 01:03:40,123
It should be, but it isn't.

790
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:46,458
That's not bad. Thank you...

791
01:03:46,666 --> 01:03:48,293
..son.

792
01:03:48,535 --> 01:03:51,629
- You're welcome.
- Where's your brother?

793
01:03:51,804 --> 01:03:53,931
I sent him away.
He wasn't feeling well.

794
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:57,041
- You know how he is, he worries.
- Yeah, I know.

795
01:03:57,243 --> 01:03:59,336
He gets that from your mother,
I'm afraid.

796
01:04:00,113 --> 01:04:01,580
She always worried too much.

797
01:04:01,781 --> 01:04:03,476
What are you looking at?

798
01:04:04,284 --> 01:04:06,081
Oh, yeah, here, take a gander.

799
01:04:06,286 --> 01:04:09,653
It's a proposal for a museum.

800
01:04:09,856 --> 01:04:13,053
- Who is it?
- Someone new.

801
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:17,259
Oh, I like the walkways,
where the light falls.

802
01:04:17,463 --> 01:04:19,090
What are the materials?

803
01:04:19,499 --> 01:04:21,490
Granite. Aluminum.

804
01:04:21,701 --> 01:04:24,169
White panels
are straight out of Meier...

805
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:28,704
..but the interior color coming through
the front windows, that's different.

806
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:32,875
It's not new,
but it's clean, uncluttered.

807
01:04:33,112 --> 01:04:34,807
I like it.

808
01:04:35,381 --> 01:04:38,441
When was the last time
you were in Barcelona?

809
01:04:40,219 --> 01:04:42,687
Years ago, with you, Mom and Henry.

810
01:04:42,889 --> 01:04:45,517
Do you remember visiting
Casa de la Caritat?

811
01:04:46,693 --> 01:04:48,320
The almshouse.

812
01:04:48,528 --> 01:04:50,996
That's right. You mentioned Meier.

813
01:04:51,197 --> 01:04:56,100
His Barcelona museum stands
in the same area as Casa de la Caritat.

814
01:04:56,302 --> 01:04:58,293
It drinks the same light.

815
01:04:58,504 --> 01:05:03,407
Meier designed a series of louvered
skylights to capture that light...

816
01:05:03,643 --> 01:05:08,410
..and cast it inward to illuminate
the art within, but indirectly.

817
01:05:08,648 --> 01:05:13,642
And that was important,
because although light enhances art...

818
01:05:13,853 --> 01:05:18,654
..it can also degrade it. But you know
all that already, you son of a gun.

819
01:05:18,825 --> 01:05:20,725
Now, this...

820
01:05:22,662 --> 01:05:24,687
..where do you suppose
this is to be built?

821
01:05:24,864 --> 01:05:25,922
I have no idea.

822
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:28,533
- Oh, but you said you liked it.
- Conceptually.

823
01:05:28,701 --> 01:05:30,931
Now, come on.

824
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:33,832
You know as well as I do
that the light in Barcelona...

825
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,406
..is quite different
from the light in Tokyo.

826
01:05:36,576 --> 01:05:39,670
And the light in Tokyo
is different from that in Prague.

827
01:05:39,879 --> 01:05:45,875
A truly great structure, one that
is meant to stand the tests of time...

828
01:05:46,085 --> 01:05:48,576
..never disregards its environment.

829
01:05:48,788 --> 01:05:50,585
An architect takes that into account.

830
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:55,523
He knows that if he wants presence,
he must consult with nature.

831
01:05:55,728 --> 01:06:00,131
He must be captivated by the light.

832
01:06:00,299 --> 01:06:04,030
Always the light. Always.

833
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:01,923
Hey. I have an emergency.
Take my shift. Please.

834
01:07:06,933 --> 01:07:08,457
Hello.

835
01:07:08,668 --> 01:07:11,296
<i>- Mr. Wyler?
- Yes.</i>

836
01:07:11,504 --> 01:07:14,701
<i>This is Dr. Klyczynski
at Chicago City Hospital.</i>

837
01:07:15,441 --> 01:07:18,933
<i>I'm afraid I have some
difficult news for you.</i>

838
01:07:21,748 --> 01:07:24,308
<i>I'm so sorry, Alex.</i>

839
01:07:25,551 --> 01:07:28,645
<i>I wish somehow
I could be there with you...</i>

840
01:07:29,188 --> 01:07:32,885
<i>...that we could sit together and look
out over the water and the light...</i>

841
01:07:33,126 --> 01:07:36,027
<i>...in this house your father built.</i>

842
01:07:39,031 --> 01:07:41,898
<i>I could be a shoulder for you
like you've been for me.</i>

843
01:07:42,135 --> 01:07:45,263
<i>And tell you that
everything is gonna be okay.</i>

844
01:07:47,173 --> 01:07:50,006
<i>If I could do one thing for you today...</i>

845
01:07:50,209 --> 01:07:52,268
<i>...from here...</i>

846
01:07:52,478 --> 01:07:56,073
<i>...one small, simple thing
from the future...</i>

847
01:07:56,682 --> 01:07:58,673
<i>...I hope this is it.</i>

848
01:08:00,086 --> 01:08:02,816
<i>It won't be published
for a couple of years...</i>

849
01:08:03,022 --> 01:08:05,684
<i>...but I don't think
you should have to wait that long.</i>

850
01:08:07,393 --> 01:08:10,362
<i>I hope it helps you know
how much you were loved.</i>

851
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,200
Pick a place. I'll be there, I promise.

852
01:09:57,436 --> 01:09:58,767
Tomorrow, what do you say?

853
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:00,802
But, Alex,
it won't be tomorrow for you.

854
01:10:01,007 --> 01:10:04,408
- You're gonna have to wait two years.
- I know, I don't care. I'll wait.

855
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:05,941
Are you sure? I don't know.

856
01:10:06,145 --> 01:10:08,613
I do. I've never been so sure
of anything in my life.

857
01:10:08,814 --> 01:10:11,942
Okay. I'll see you in two years, then.

858
01:10:12,151 --> 01:10:14,415
See you tomorrow, then.

859
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,515
Kate...

860
01:10:16,722 --> 01:10:18,713
..where would you like to go?

861
01:10:21,527 --> 01:10:23,188
II Mare.

862
01:10:23,362 --> 01:10:25,353
When were you hoping
to dine with us?

863
01:10:25,564 --> 01:10:27,156
Two years from tomorrow.

864
01:10:27,366 --> 01:10:29,527
- Two years from tomorrow?
- Yeah.

865
01:10:29,735 --> 01:10:31,703
- Two years?
- From tomorrow.

866
01:10:33,673 --> 01:10:35,664
- Hi.
- Hello. Name?

867
01:10:35,841 --> 01:10:36,967
Forster.

868
01:10:37,143 --> 01:10:38,508
- Can I have your name?
- Wyler.

869
01:10:38,678 --> 01:10:41,238
Or Wyler, I'm...
I'm really not sure.

870
01:10:41,414 --> 01:10:43,644
I think we should be able
to accommodate you.

871
01:10:43,849 --> 01:10:44,907
- Great.
- Wyler?

872
01:10:47,086 --> 01:10:48,576
Wyler.

873
01:10:50,222 --> 01:10:52,690
Your waiter will be right with you.

874
01:11:16,849 --> 01:11:19,010
Good evening, miss.

875
01:11:20,686 --> 01:11:23,120
Complimentary.

876
01:11:33,399 --> 01:11:36,232
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

877
01:11:58,891 --> 01:12:01,257
Another glass for the lady?

878
01:13:28,914 --> 01:13:31,007
<i>You weren't there.</i>

879
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:33,545
<i>You didn't come.</i>

880
01:13:39,925 --> 01:13:41,722
I don't understand.

881
01:13:41,927 --> 01:13:45,055
<i>Something must have happened.
I'm sorry.</i>

882
01:13:45,264 --> 01:13:48,131
<i>I've got two years, Kate.
We can try again.</i>

883
01:13:48,334 --> 01:13:52,566
<i>No, Alex, it's too late.</i>

884
01:13:52,771 --> 01:13:56,366
<i>It already happened. It didn't work.</i>

885
01:13:56,575 --> 01:13:58,509
<i>Don't give up on me, Kate.</i>

886
01:13:58,711 --> 01:14:02,408
<i>What about Persuasion?
You told me. They wait.</i>

887
01:14:02,648 --> 01:14:04,673
<i>They meet again,
they have another chance.</i>

888
01:14:04,884 --> 01:14:07,011
<i>Life is not a book, Alex.</i>

889
01:14:07,219 --> 01:14:09,710
<i>And it can be over in a second.</i>

890
01:14:09,922 --> 01:14:13,289
<i>I was having lunch with my mother
at Daley Plaza...</i>

891
01:14:13,526 --> 01:14:16,256
<i>...and a man was killed
right in front of me.</i>

892
01:14:16,462 --> 01:14:18,692
<i>He died in my arms.</i>

893
01:14:18,898 --> 01:14:20,422
<i>And I thought:</i>

894
01:14:20,666 --> 01:14:24,932
<i>"It can't end just like that
on Valentine's Day. "</i>

895
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:28,863
<i>I thought about all the people
who love him, waiting at home...</i>

896
01:14:29,074 --> 01:14:31,565
<i>...who will never see him again.</i>

897
01:14:32,478 --> 01:14:34,412
<i>And then I thought:</i>

898
01:14:34,613 --> 01:14:36,945
<i>"What if there is no one?"</i>

899
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:43,245
<i>What if you live your whole life
and no one is waiting?</i>

900
01:14:43,756 --> 01:14:47,692
<i>So I drove to the lake house
looking for any kind of answer.</i>

901
01:14:47,893 --> 01:14:50,293
<i>And I found you.</i>

902
01:14:50,496 --> 01:14:52,930
<i>And I let myself get lost.</i>

903
01:14:53,132 --> 01:14:58,502
<i>Lost in this beautiful fantasy
where time stood still.</i>

904
01:14:58,971 --> 01:15:01,337
<i>But it's not real, Alex.</i>

905
01:15:01,574 --> 01:15:06,511
<i>I have to learn to live
the life that I have got.</i>

906
01:15:08,113 --> 01:15:10,308
<i>Please don't write anymore.</i>

907
01:15:10,516 --> 01:15:12,814
<i>Don't try to find me.</i>

908
01:15:13,752 --> 01:15:16,414
<i>Let me let you go.</i>

909
01:16:03,802 --> 01:16:05,633
Hello.

910
01:16:06,405 --> 01:16:09,340
What? Sorry, hold on.
I can't hear you. I'll be back, sorry.

911
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:12,203
Hello. Hold on. Hold on.

912
01:16:12,645 --> 01:16:14,340
Hello.

913
01:16:16,882 --> 01:16:18,645
Hi.

914
01:16:24,189 --> 01:16:26,384
How long are you here?

915
01:16:29,595 --> 01:16:32,928
- I'm at a bar with some friends.
- Come.

916
01:16:33,165 --> 01:16:35,725
Well, don't get too excited.

917
01:16:37,169 --> 01:16:39,729
I find that hard to believe.

918
01:16:41,707 --> 01:16:43,174
It is good.

919
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:46,367
And it was really good
to hear your voice.

920
01:16:46,578 --> 01:16:49,911
I was surprised how good
it was to hear your voice.

921
01:16:53,052 --> 01:16:54,542
So how was your meeting?

922
01:16:54,753 --> 01:16:56,880
- It was good.
- Yeah?

923
01:16:57,089 --> 01:16:59,922
Yeah, I... I got the job.

924
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:02,457
- Really?
- Yeah.

925
01:17:02,895 --> 01:17:05,056
- Well, congratulations.
- Imagine that.

926
01:17:05,264 --> 01:17:10,896
Yeah. A telecom company.
I'll be in-house counsel. Pays well.

927
01:17:11,103 --> 01:17:13,196
And it's here...

928
01:17:13,405 --> 01:17:14,872
..in Chicago.

929
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:17,437
Well...

930
01:17:17,643 --> 01:17:19,736
..it's great news.

931
01:17:22,114 --> 01:17:23,911
Hey.

932
01:17:27,886 --> 01:17:29,581
What?

933
01:17:49,775 --> 01:17:51,265
Jack.

934
01:17:51,477 --> 01:17:53,411
Hey, Jack.

935
01:17:53,746 --> 01:17:55,509
Jack.

936
01:19:15,961 --> 01:19:18,225
Are you gonna
come down this weekend?

937
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:22,594
Don't you miss me a little bit?

938
01:19:23,268 --> 01:19:25,736
Oh, just a little bit. Not a lot, huh?

939
01:19:26,205 --> 01:19:29,868
Okay. No, I heard you. Yeah.

940
01:19:31,743 --> 01:19:35,008
Kate, I'm gonna
have to call you back, okay?

941
01:19:49,862 --> 01:19:52,296
Still wanna rent a lake house?

942
01:19:53,232 --> 01:19:55,564
It's what Kate wants.

943
01:19:55,767 --> 01:19:58,361
How the hell do you know
what Kate wants?

944
01:19:59,738 --> 01:20:01,399
Trust me.

945
01:20:13,285 --> 01:20:16,413
Hey, you. I know you.

946
01:20:22,761 --> 01:20:25,457
Whatever you want out back.

947
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,191
What do you think?

948
01:20:57,796 --> 01:20:59,923
You're fixating. You know?

949
01:21:00,966 --> 01:21:02,797
Why do you keep
tweaking the lake house?

950
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:05,094
Why don't you do your own work?

951
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:07,500
Because it's hers.

952
01:21:07,873 --> 01:21:13,140
You're talking about the girl
from the future.

953
01:21:13,345 --> 01:21:15,006
Kate.

954
01:21:15,847 --> 01:21:18,611
And you're still writing with Kate?

955
01:21:18,984 --> 01:21:22,351
- No.
- Why not?

956
01:21:23,822 --> 01:21:25,380
She asked me not to.

957
01:21:26,091 --> 01:21:27,786
Why?

958
01:21:30,095 --> 01:21:31,790
Time.

959
01:21:35,701 --> 01:21:37,225
Hey, come on.

960
01:21:37,469 --> 01:21:41,200
This is a good thing.
You know, you need a real woman.

961
01:21:41,406 --> 01:21:44,500
- A woman...
- Henry, listen.

962
01:21:45,711 --> 01:21:47,508
Listen to me.

963
01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:52,974
While it lasted, she was
more real to me than any of that stuff.

964
01:21:53,185 --> 01:21:57,315
She was more real to me
than anything I've ever known.

965
01:21:59,524 --> 01:22:01,355
I saw her.

966
01:22:02,227 --> 01:22:04,058
I kissed her.

967
01:22:06,431 --> 01:22:08,058
I love her.

968
01:22:11,236 --> 01:22:13,329
And now she's gone.

969
01:22:22,247 --> 01:22:24,010
She's gone.

970
01:22:31,423 --> 01:22:33,050
<i>And Duckett squirts through.</i>

971
01:22:33,558 --> 01:22:35,253
<i>First thing...</i>

972
01:22:36,795 --> 01:22:39,161
<i>How could the Ab Scissor
four-minute ab machine...?</i>

973
01:22:39,364 --> 01:22:42,026
<i>- and your potatoes
cooking on the top.</i>

974
01:22:42,234 --> 01:22:45,795
<i>It's nice out here. Let's stay here.</i>

975
01:22:46,038 --> 01:22:47,903
<i>But we have to eat.</i>

976
01:22:48,907 --> 01:22:52,104
<i>We can eat here. I'll cook.</i>

977
01:22:52,477 --> 01:22:54,741
<i>I thought you didn't like to cook.</i>

978
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:57,678
<i>No, I don't like to cook.</i>

979
01:22:59,317 --> 01:23:02,616
<i>But I have a chicken in the icebox,
and you're eating it.</i>

980
01:23:02,821 --> 01:23:04,948
<i>What about all
the washing-up afterward?</i>

981
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:07,750
<i>- We'll eat with our fingers.
- Could you turn that down?</i>

982
01:23:07,959 --> 01:23:09,392
<i>Don't we need any plates?</i>

983
01:23:09,594 --> 01:23:13,291
<i>Yes. One for you,
and one for...</i>

984
01:24:24,903 --> 01:24:28,339
"There could have been
no two hearts so open...

985
01:24:29,007 --> 01:24:31,805
..no tastes so similar...

986
01:24:33,011 --> 01:24:35,912
..no feelings so in unison. "

987
01:24:50,495 --> 01:24:55,330
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

988
01:24:55,534 --> 01:25:00,028
..five, four, three, two, one.

989
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:03,105
Happy New Year!

990
01:25:15,687 --> 01:25:17,450
Come in.

991
01:25:32,337 --> 01:25:33,964
Hi.

992
01:25:34,472 --> 01:25:35,962
Hi.

993
01:25:37,475 --> 01:25:38,908
What do you think?

994
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:40,975
This is what I gave up lunch for?

995
01:25:41,213 --> 01:25:45,946
- I know it needs work.
- Work? How about a wrecking ball?

996
01:25:46,251 --> 01:25:49,277
I found an architect
who specializes in renovations.

997
01:25:49,487 --> 01:25:51,921
I made an appointment for tomorrow.

998
01:25:56,428 --> 01:25:57,986
Ambush.

999
01:25:58,230 --> 01:25:59,492
Come on.

1000
01:25:59,731 --> 01:26:03,223
We can't stay in my apartment.
We've been there over a year.

1001
01:26:04,369 --> 01:26:06,098
I wanna keep moving forward.

1002
01:26:16,681 --> 01:26:19,980
- It's a new firm.
- "New" as in inexperienced?

1003
01:26:20,185 --> 01:26:22,949
No. "New" as in cheap.

1004
01:26:33,164 --> 01:26:35,530
Hi, Dr. Forster.
We'll be with you in a moment.

1005
01:26:35,767 --> 01:26:37,462
Great, thank you.

1006
01:26:51,216 --> 01:26:54,310
Oh, by the way...

1007
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,847
..happy Valentine's Day.

1008
01:26:58,056 --> 01:27:01,184
Oh, God, Katie,
I didn't get you anything.

1009
01:27:01,426 --> 01:27:04,554
I'm sorry. I've just been
so swamped and...

1010
01:27:04,796 --> 01:27:06,696
Doesn't matter.

1011
01:27:23,214 --> 01:27:26,980
- What is this?
- It's global warming.

1012
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:33,213
Dr. Forster?
Hi, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

1013
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:54,444
- Hi. Good to see you again.
- Dr. Forster. You too.

1014
01:27:54,679 --> 01:27:57,580
- Hi, I'm Morgan.
- Hey, Morgan. Vanessa Vanderbeck.

1015
01:27:57,782 --> 01:28:02,082
So obviously, the first thing you see
is what we had talked about. The atrium.

1016
01:28:02,787 --> 01:28:04,186
That's stunning.

1017
01:28:04,356 --> 01:28:07,883
So we were able to do it with all
the glass panels in the metal structure?

1018
01:28:08,093 --> 01:28:09,685
- Yeah.
- Can I...?

1019
01:28:09,961 --> 01:28:11,258
Wanna get a beer after work?

1020
01:28:11,496 --> 01:28:15,557
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm taking
Vanessa out for Valentine's Day.

1021
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:20,760
Wait.

1022
01:28:21,306 --> 01:28:22,739
Say that again.

1023
01:28:22,941 --> 01:28:26,069
It's Valentine's Day today.
I'm taking out Vanessa, my girlfriend.

1024
01:28:26,277 --> 01:28:29,644
Cold champagne, some oysters,
maybe a little chocolate.

1025
01:28:29,881 --> 01:28:33,373
- What's the date?
- It's February 14th.

1026
01:28:34,285 --> 01:28:38,551
- February 14th, 2006.
- Yeah.

1027
01:28:39,157 --> 01:28:42,024
- Stunning. Thank you so much.
- Our pleasure.

1028
01:28:42,227 --> 01:28:44,661
Thank you. Henry will
make sure you have everything.

1029
01:28:44,896 --> 01:28:46,796
Great. They were absolutely beautiful.

1030
01:28:47,032 --> 01:28:48,522
Thank you.

1031
01:28:49,801 --> 01:28:51,291
What?

1032
01:28:52,771 --> 01:28:56,070
Katie, I gotta get back to work.

1033
01:28:59,044 --> 01:29:00,909
Who did this drawing?

1034
01:29:01,112 --> 01:29:03,239
My brother did, actually.

1035
01:29:03,415 --> 01:29:04,780
Who's your brother?

1036
01:29:04,983 --> 01:29:06,974
Alex Wyler.

1037
01:29:07,285 --> 01:29:09,048
Did you know him?

1038
01:29:11,189 --> 01:29:12,747
Yeah.

1039
01:29:13,691 --> 01:29:15,454
Yeah, I know him.

1040
01:29:17,962 --> 01:29:20,157
Do you know how
I can get in touch with him?

1041
01:29:20,365 --> 01:29:23,266
Is he...?
Is he anywhere that I can?

1042
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:27,835
I'm sorry.

1043
01:29:28,473 --> 01:29:32,500
He died...

1044
01:29:32,977 --> 01:29:35,673
..two years ago today, actually.

1045
01:29:38,983 --> 01:29:41,076
There was an accident.

1046
01:29:58,736 --> 01:30:00,328
Where?

1047
01:30:04,008 --> 01:30:05,498
Kate.

1048
01:30:07,879 --> 01:30:10,313
Wait, just stop. Just stop.

1049
01:30:10,815 --> 01:30:12,908
Goddamn it, answer me.

1050
01:30:13,218 --> 01:30:17,245
What is the matter? Kate.

1051
01:30:19,924 --> 01:30:21,482
Kate!

1052
01:31:25,924 --> 01:31:28,950
Sixty degrees on Valentine's Day.

1053
01:31:29,194 --> 01:31:31,492
This cannot be Chicago.

1054
01:31:31,896 --> 01:31:34,922
The TV says it's global warming.

1055
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:37,063
Nothing wrong with that.

1056
01:31:37,268 --> 01:31:38,997
It's a dangerous thing.

1057
01:31:39,437 --> 01:31:41,132
<i>Alex...</i>

1058
01:31:42,574 --> 01:31:45,475
<i>...I know why you
didn't show up that night.</i>

1059
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:48,975
<i>It was you at Daley Plaza that day.</i>

1060
01:31:50,148 --> 01:31:51,945
<i>It was you.</i>

1061
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:54,909
<i>Please, don't go.</i>

1062
01:31:55,987 --> 01:31:59,445
<i>Just wait. Please.</i>

1063
01:32:00,425 --> 01:32:01,790
<i>Don't look for me.</i>

1064
01:32:01,993 --> 01:32:04,325
<i>Don't try to find me.</i>

1065
01:32:06,497 --> 01:32:08,362
<i>I love you.</i>

1066
01:32:11,202 --> 01:32:14,831
<i>And it's taken me all this time
to say it, but I love you.</i>

1067
01:32:22,347 --> 01:32:23,974
<i>And if you still care for me...</i>

1068
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:27,784
<i>...wait for me.</i>

1069
01:32:28,319 --> 01:32:30,310
<i>Wait with me.</i>

1070
01:32:30,521 --> 01:32:34,013
<i>Just wait. Wait.</i>

1071
01:32:42,767 --> 01:32:45,167
<i>Wait two years, Alex.</i>

1072
01:32:45,637 --> 01:32:47,969
<i>Come to the lake house.</i>

1073
01:32:48,339 --> 01:32:50,170
<i>I'm here.</i>

1074
01:33:47,365 --> 01:33:49,196
You waited.

1075
01:35:28,512 --> 01:36:30,503
