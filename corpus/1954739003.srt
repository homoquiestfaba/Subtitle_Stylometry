And one of the great joys

252
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:23,498
has been in meeting you
and working with you.

253
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:25,498
No one deserves to be

254
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,498

Our first roaster
is here tonight

263
00:10:51,499 --> 00:10:52,498
only because he's Colombian

264
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:53,498

needed the cocaine.

to hang in there after <i>Seinfeld.</i>

00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:20,498
You had shows like
<i>Bob Patterson</i> and <i>Listen Up.</i>

273
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:22,499
Those shows disappeared faster
than a bowl of Percocet

274
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:25,499

275
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:35,499

Look at his dais.

277
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:48,498

and an Asian.

278
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,499

279

Farrah Fawcett,

281
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:02,498

masturbate to 30 years ago

282
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:04,499

What a cruel joke.

286
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:16,498
Three women you'd want
to fuck 30 years ago

287
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:20,499
and one I wouldn't fuck
30 beers from now.

288
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:28,499
Artie Lang, you...

289
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,499

290
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:36,498
Artie, your liver
has more holes in it

291
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:38,499

00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:42,498
Your liver's so black,
Lisa Lampanelli

293
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:43,498

00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:54,498
Sorry to pick on you,

297
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:57,499
I know it couldn't be easy
being a gay Japanese man

298
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:59,498
in the '50s.

299
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:00,498
I mean, it had to be
almost impossible

300
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:03,499
to pronounce "glory hole"
with a Japanese accent.

301
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:08,498
<i>George, you'll be</i>

00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,498
Jeff is such
a huge asshole,

304
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,499

<i>Hi William.</i>

308
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:28,498
Bill, it's uh--

309
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:30,498
That was quite an entrance.

310
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:32,498
When I heard someone
was gonna come on a horse,

311
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:35,498
I thought, "Wow, the network's
really gonna let Andy Dick

312
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:39,499
and Lisa Lampanelli
get away with murder."

313
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:42,499
You're the horse!

314
00:13:45,499 --> 00:13:47,498
Bill, you're not
just brilliant

315
00:13:47,499 --> 00:13:49,498
and old and fat.

316
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:51,498
You're--you're
an inspiration.

317
00:13:51,499 --> 00:13:52,498
You proved that
having no talent

318
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,499
can be seen as hip
and ironic.

319
00:13:56,499 --> 00:14:00,499
You overact more than
Betty White's bladder.

320
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:05,498
<i>Wow.</i>
<i>Then, uh--</i>

321
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:07,498
Then, of course,
there was <i>T.J. Hooker.</i>

322
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:09,498
The only thing I remember
about that show

323
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:11,498
was your hair and that
hot chick what's-her-face,

324
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:12,498
Adrian Zmed.

325
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:13,498
What, uh--

326
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:16,499
<i>What happened to her?</i>

327
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:20,498
You're a humanitarian.

328
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:21,498
You work with a foundation
to bring peace

329
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:23,498
to the Middle East.

330
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:25,498
And whatever it is
you're doing, keep it up.

331
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:29,498
<i>'Cause it's really working.</i>

332
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:30,498
It's really working.

[cheers and applause]

334
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:35,498
You know, Bill, one of the most
surreal parts of this business

335
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,498
is that I get to stand here

336
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:38,498
and make fun
of a legend like you.

337
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:40,498
You were an enormous part
of my youth

338
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:42,498
and you made Captain Kirk
larger than life.

339
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:44,498
And really, honestly
no actor who's ever lived

340
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:46,498
could have done more
with that role.

341
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:48,498
And the fact that you
continue to crank out

342
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:49,498
the best work
you've done today,

343
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:53,498
when statistically,
you should be dead,

344
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:56,498
is really really inspiring.
Thank you very much.

00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:12,498
(announcer)
And Lisa Lampanelli.

354
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:15,499
I expect no quarter,
and I'm giving none.

355
00:15:22,595 --> 00:15:23,594
Our next guest
is the only person

356
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:24,594
on this stage
who has fucked

357
00:15:24,595 --> 00:15:26,594
all four of
the Marx Brothers.

358
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:28,594
Ms. Betty White,
ladies and gentlemen!

359
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,594
♪ Oh, no, not I

360
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:32,594
♪ I will survive

361
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:35,388
♪ Oh, as long as
I know how to love ♪

362
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:36,594
♪ I know I'm still alive

363
00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:37,594
♪ I've got
all my life to live ♪

364
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:40,595
Oh, thank you.

365
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:45,595
Oh!

366
00:15:55,595 --> 00:15:59,595
And thank you
so very much and good night.

367
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:05,594
Oh, Jason Alexander,
you are such a treat.

368
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:09,595
You know, I was expecting you
to be just dreadful.

369
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:12,594
Well, in all fairness,

370
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:16,595
I was basing that on everything
you've ever done, but--

371
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:21,594
But isn't this
just wonderful?

372
00:16:21,595 --> 00:16:23,594
I mean,
all you youngsters

373
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:26,595
getting together
to tell naughty jokes.

374
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:28,595
Oh.

375
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:30,594
It's like the great roasts
I went to

376
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:33,594
in the good old days.

377
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:35,594
Of course,
you wouldn't have been

378
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,594
allowed in, Nichelle.

379
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:41,595
<i>Sorry.</i>

380
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:52,594
Oh, we had our fun.

381
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:55,594
You know, I've been
a huge Trekkie

382
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:57,594
ever since
the show first aired.

383
00:16:57,595 --> 00:16:59,594
And that's why
I'm so thrilled to see Nichelle

384
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:02,594
and George Takei here tonight.

385
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:05,594
'Cause, let's face it--

386
00:17:05,595 --> 00:17:09,594
we all know Shatner's nuts.

387
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:13,595
But George has actually
tasted them.

388
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:26,594
Whoo!

389
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:28,594
Oh, it always
makes me laugh

390
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:32,594
when I see Artie Lang
onstage,

391
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:35,595
knowing I'm gonna
outlive him.

392
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:40,594
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

393
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:41,594
No.

394
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:44,594
Oh, but you know
who I love.

395
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:47,594
Look at that Patton Oswalt.

396
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:49,594
<i>So adorable.</i>

397
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:52,595
He's like
a plump little troll.

398
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:58,595
Backstage I caught him
going up on Farrah Fawcett.

399
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:07,594
Oh, Farrah, you know
I don't mean any of this.

400
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:10,594
<i>I feel such a special</i>
<i>connection to you, Farrah.</i>

401
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:11,971
I'm in my 80s,

402
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:16,595
and that's the last decade
you mattered.

403
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:25,594
And who else
is here tonight?

404
00:18:25,595 --> 00:18:27,594
Uh, where's Spock?

405
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:29,594
And James Spader?

406
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:31,595
And Bones and Scotty
and...

407
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:34,594
Oh, Bill,
all your friends

408
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:37,595
are either dead
or they hate you.

409
00:18:38,595 --> 00:18:41,594
To be fair, I'm a little
of column A

410
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:43,595
and a little
of column B.

411
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:49,594
But you look great.

412
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:54,595
You know, they make
1% milk now.

413
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:02,594
Darling,
you were supposed to

414
00:19:02,595 --> 00:19:05,594
explore the galaxy.

415
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:07,595
Not fill it.

416
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:11,594
All joking aside,

417
00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:13,594
Bill can be
quite a charmer.

418
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:15,594
I'm not ashamed to say

419
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:17,595
that I once
had sex with Bill Shatner.

420
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:21,595
[cheering]

421
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:31,594
Oh, you should have seen him
sweating and grunting

422
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:34,595
and so red in the face
and wheezing.

423
00:19:35,595 --> 00:19:39,594
Finally, I said, "Bill,
you better hurry up and finish.

424
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,595
In two minutes, they're
gonna start the roast."

425
00:19:49,595 --> 00:19:51,594
Of course,
I'm still joking.

426
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:53,594
Bill is
a happily married man.

427
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:57,594
I caught the bouquet
at Bill's wedding.

428
00:19:57,595 --> 00:19:59,594
And I hope I'm still around
to catch the cock ring

429
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:01,595
at Sulu's.

430
00:20:08,595 --> 00:20:12,594
Bill, the truth is,
I dearly love you.

431
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:15,594
I've always admired you
as an actor.

432
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:19,594
I think you're funny
and smart and kind.

433
00:20:19,595 --> 00:20:21,594
And I was so excited
when I found out

434
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:26,594
I'd be working with you
on <i>Boston Legal.</i>

435
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:29,594
Till I worked with you
on <i>Boston Legal.</i>

436
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,595
Good night!

437
00:20:42,595 --> 00:20:43,594
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

438
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:47,595
the roastmaster general,
Mr. Jeffrey Ross!

439
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:58,594
All right.

440
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:01,594
Thank you, Artie.

441
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:04,594
Artie's here just to
finish people's drinks.

442
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:06,594
[laughter]

443
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:07,595
<i>That's good, you're like</i>
<i>the Chris Farley</i>

444
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:10,594
<i>of satellite radio.</i>

445
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:11,595
[laughter]

446
00:21:13,595 --> 00:21:15,594
Jason Alexander.

447
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:16,594
<i>Sir.</i>

448
00:21:16,595 --> 00:21:18,594
You clearly come from
the planet Trying-too-hard.

449
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:20,595
[laughter]

450
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:23,594
You sing, you dance,
you act.

451
00:21:23,595 --> 00:21:26,595
You do everything
but make people laugh.

452
00:21:28,595 --> 00:21:31,595
But I did love you in
<i>March of the Penguins.</i>

453
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,595
Yeah!

454
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:39,594
<i>As many of you know,</i>

455
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:42,594
last year Comedy Central
threw a very successful roast

456
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:43,594
of Pamela Anderson.

457
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,594
And this year, in keeping
with that tradition,

458
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,595
we're roasting another
bad actor with big tits.

459
00:21:53,595 --> 00:21:55,594
Look at you!

460
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:56,594
Look at you, Shatner.

461
00:21:56,595 --> 00:21:59,595
You have let yourself
boldly go.

462
00:22:02,595 --> 00:22:03,594
When did you go
from Captain Kirk

463
00:22:03,595 --> 00:22:05,595
to Captain Crunch?

464
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:10,595
You left <i>T.J. Hooker</i>
and went to P.F. Chang's!

465
00:22:14,595 --> 00:22:17,595
You work at <i>Boston Legal</i>
or Boston Market?

466
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:20,594
If Scotty tried to
beam you up now,

467
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:22,595
you'd break
the fucking transporter.

468
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:27,594
But I must admit I am
the world's biggest

469
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:28,594
<i>Star Trek</i> fan.

470
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:30,594
I've seen every episode
a million times.

471
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:32,594
And I always wished
just once...

472
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:33,594
Just once
that spaceship of yours

473
00:22:33,595 --> 00:22:36,595
would land on a planet
with an acting school.

474
00:22:39,595 --> 00:22:41,594
You sound like
you forgot...

475
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:43,595
your fucking...
lines.

476
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:49,594
And now you play a guy
with Alzheimer's?

477
00:22:49,595 --> 00:22:50,595
That's a fucking
lucky break, huh?

478
00:22:54,595 --> 00:22:56,594
<i>Hey, if ain't broke,</i>

479
00:22:56,595 --> 00:22:58,595
don't fix it,
you know what I'm saying?

480
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:04,594
But seriously, this is
such a huge honor for me

481
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:09,594
to be roasting the spokesman
for priceline.com.

482
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:13,595
Who we roasting next year,
the Travelocity gnome?

483
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,594
What happened, we couldn't
get the lizard from GEICO

484
00:23:17,595 --> 00:23:19,595
up in this motherfucker?

485
00:23:22,595 --> 00:23:24,594
Anyway, speaking of Shatner,

486
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:27,595
Betty White
just shat in her pants.

487
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:34,594
All right, Farrah Fawcett,
let's face it.

488
00:23:34,595 --> 00:23:36,594
Farrah, the truth is
my whole life

489
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:38,594
I had that poster of you.

490
00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:40,594
And as a kid
I would always

491
00:23:40,595 --> 00:23:42,594
masturbate to it,
hoping that I wouldn't go blind.

492
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:46,595
And now that
I see you in person...

493
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,595
What the fuck?
It's a roast!

494
00:23:52,595 --> 00:23:54,594
<i>Betty White, can you</i>
<i>explain the jokes</i>

495
00:23:54,595 --> 00:23:58,594
to Farrah, please?

496
00:23:58,595 --> 00:23:59,594
After last year's roast,

497
00:23:59,595 --> 00:24:02,594
Andy Dick
kissed my girlfriend's hand.

498
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:04,595
40 minutes later,
she was dead.

499
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:10,594
Andy Dick's
sole mission in life

500
00:24:10,595 --> 00:24:12,595
is to give AIDS
back to the monkeys.

501
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:22,594
No, the truth is,
Mr. Shatner,

502
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:25,262
growing up I always
had a strong distrust

503
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,595
for both Klingons
and Puerto Ricans.

504
00:24:28,388 --> 00:24:31,594
But watching <i>Star Trek</i>
taught me

505
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,594
it doesn't matter
whether you're black or white

506
00:24:32,595 --> 00:24:34,594
or blue or green

507
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:36,594
or an old washed-up bag
like Betty White.

508
00:24:36,595 --> 00:24:38,594
We all want
the same things in life

509
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:40,594
and that's to live long
and prosper.

510
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:41,594
I love you, man.

511
00:24:41,595 --> 00:24:43,595
Nanu Nanu.

512
00:24:49,595 --> 00:24:51,594
(announcer)
Coming up, Artie Lang,

513
00:24:51,595 --> 00:24:52,594
Fred Willard,

514
00:24:52,595 --> 00:24:53,595
and Sandra Bullock.

515
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:57,685
Hi, I'm Sandra Bullock.

516
00:24:57,686 --> 00:24:59,685
And I worked with
William Shatner

517
00:24:59,686 --> 00:25:01,685
on the <i>Miss Congeniality</i>
movies.

518
00:25:01,686 --> 00:25:03,685
You know,
I think it is so great

519
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:05,685
that everyone got together
to salute Bill

520
00:25:05,686 --> 00:25:07,685
and have some laughs
at his expense.

521
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:11,685
But, you know,
please, please don't be too mean

522
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:12,685
to him tonight.

523
00:25:12,686 --> 00:25:16,685
'Cause the truth is,
Bill is a nice, sweet...

524
00:25:16,686 --> 00:25:18,685
kindhearted old man.

525
00:25:18,686 --> 00:25:21,685
And it's really not cool
to make fun of the elderly

526
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,685
and the feeble.

527
00:25:23,686 --> 00:25:25,685
And the incontinent.

528
00:25:25,686 --> 00:25:26,685
And everything else
that Bill is.

529
00:25:26,686 --> 00:25:28,685
Just, you know,
just try to be sensitive

530
00:25:28,686 --> 00:25:32,685
to how it must feel
to be so close to death

531
00:25:32,686 --> 00:25:34,685
and addlebrained.

532
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:36,686
I mean, half the time
on the set of

533
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:40,685
<i>Miss Congeniality...</i>

534
00:25:40,686 --> 00:25:43,685
Wow.
This is hard..

535
00:25:43,686 --> 00:25:45,685
Bill thought he was
on the deck

536
00:25:45,686 --> 00:25:46,685
of the <i>Enterprise.</i>

537
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:50,685
And...for some reason,
he'd walk up behind me

538
00:25:50,686 --> 00:25:52,685
and he'd cup my buttocks
with his hands

539
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:54,685
and call me Sulu.

540
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,685
And each day at 2:30,

541
00:25:56,686 --> 00:25:57,685
he had to go back
to his trailer

542
00:25:57,686 --> 00:26:00,685
with his nurse, who was
this really nice guy

543
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:03,685
named Darnell,
for a medical procedure

544
00:26:03,686 --> 00:26:04,685
known as
milking the prostate.

545
00:26:04,686 --> 00:26:08,685
And I can't begin to imagine
how uncomfortable

546
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:10,685
that was for Bill.

547
00:26:10,686 --> 00:26:13,685
Because Darnell had
what could only be described

548
00:26:13,686 --> 00:26:17,685
as these, like,
penis-sized fingers.

549
00:26:17,686 --> 00:26:18,685
You know, and Bill,
he's just...

550
00:26:18,686 --> 00:26:21,685
He faces each of
these challenges

551
00:26:21,686 --> 00:26:23,685
with dignity
and good humor.

552
00:26:23,686 --> 00:26:26,685
So...again,

553
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:29,685
just go easy
on the old coot.

554
00:26:29,686 --> 00:26:31,686
Thank you.

555
00:26:34,686 --> 00:26:35,685
Our next guest,
ladies and gentlemen,

556
00:26:35,686 --> 00:26:36,685
is multi-talented.

557
00:26:36,686 --> 00:26:38,685
He can black out
and shit his pants

558
00:26:38,686 --> 00:26:41,686
all at the same time,
Mr. Artie Lange!

559
00:26:45,686 --> 00:26:46,685
What's up?

560
00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:49,686
Anybody else drinking
or wha--?

561
00:26:51,686 --> 00:26:53,685
Jason Alexander, my man.

562
00:26:53,686 --> 00:26:54,685
How you doing?

563
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:56,685
Jason is a committed actor.

564
00:26:56,686 --> 00:26:58,685
Jason went from doing a show
about nothing

565
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:00,686
to actually doing nothing.

566
00:27:03,686 --> 00:27:05,685
What do you say to someone
who played an icon?

567
00:27:05,686 --> 00:27:09,685
Someone who played a character
in science fiction history

568
00:27:09,686 --> 00:27:11,685
that was one of the best ever,

569
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:15,685
and then gains a lot of weight
and becomes embarrassing?

570
00:27:15,686 --> 00:27:18,686
You say, "What happened,
Carrie Fisher?"

571
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:26,685
George Takei is here,
my friend

572
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,685
from <i>The Howard Stern Show.</i>

573
00:27:28,686 --> 00:27:29,686
The great George Takei.

574
00:27:32,686 --> 00:27:34,685
I'm friends with George
and we've hung out before.

575
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,685
It's hard hanging out
with a gay guy all day,

576
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:38,685
because you always feel like
you have to adjust

577
00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:40,685
the conversation so they
can relate to it, you know?

578
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:41,685
Like with George,
I go,

579
00:27:41,686 --> 00:27:43,685
"So, George, I was
watching the Super Bowl--

580
00:27:43,686 --> 00:27:45,686
I mean sucking cock."

581
00:27:49,686 --> 00:27:52,685
Andy, good to see
you're doing well.

582
00:27:52,686 --> 00:27:54,685
<i>A few years ago,</i>
<i>Andy was loaded</i>

583
00:27:54,686 --> 00:27:57,685
while he was driving his car
and he rammed into a pole.

584
00:27:57,686 --> 00:27:58,685
This is a big turnaround
for Andy,

585
00:27:58,686 --> 00:27:59,685
'cause usually
when he's loaded

586
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:01,686
a pole is getting rammed
into him.

587
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,685
Lisa Lampanelli, my friend.

588
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,686
Lisa, you're an overweight,
annoying female comic.

589
00:28:12,686 --> 00:28:13,685
You're seven horrible
movies away from

590
00:28:13,686 --> 00:28:16,686
being Janeane Garofalo.

591
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:21,685
A lot of people might say,
"Art, why hit Janeane?

592
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:23,685
She's not here
to defend herself."

593
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:24,685
And the answer is simple.

594
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:26,686
I've met Jeanine Garofalo,
and she's a fucking cunt.

595
00:28:32,686 --> 00:28:33,685
Kevin Pollak's here.

596
00:28:33,686 --> 00:28:35,685
Kevin's here 'cause he just does
every hacky impression

597
00:28:35,686 --> 00:28:36,685
in the world.

598
00:28:36,686 --> 00:28:37,685
You're not gonna
see him again

599
00:28:37,686 --> 00:28:40,685
unless Comedy Central
roasts Peter Falk.

600
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,686
[laughter]

601
00:28:45,686 --> 00:28:46,685
But William Shatner's here.

602
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:48,770
Let's get to
the great William Shatner.

603
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,685
Bill, I hate to say it,
but I was never

604
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:51,685
a <i>Star Trek</i> fan.

605
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:52,685
When I was a kid,
I had weird interests

606
00:28:52,686 --> 00:28:55,686
like football, baseball,
chasing pussy.

607
00:28:59,686 --> 00:29:00,685
Bill and I
have a lot in common.

608
00:29:00,686 --> 00:29:01,685
Bill was on <i>T.J. Hooker,</i>

609
00:29:01,686 --> 00:29:04,686
and I once banged a hooker
named T.J.

610
00:29:07,686 --> 00:29:09,685
Shatner's a hero to a legion
of <i>Star Trek</i> fans.

611
00:29:09,686 --> 00:29:10,685
What do they
call themselves again?

612
00:29:10,686 --> 00:29:12,686
Oh, yeah, queers.

613
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,685
And Trekkies are not
the best with women.

614
00:29:17,686 --> 00:29:19,685
Shatner's responsible
for more people

615
00:29:19,686 --> 00:29:21,686
not getting laid
than impotence.

616
00:29:23,686 --> 00:29:24,685
But, Bill, listen,
I love ya.

617
00:29:24,686 --> 00:29:26,685
This is the part where we're
supposed to say thank you.

618
00:29:26,686 --> 00:29:28,685
You're on <i>The Howard Stern Show</i>
quite a bit,

619
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:29,685
and we love having you there.

620
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:30,685
And I say this
from the bottom of my heart,

621
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:32,685
go fuck yourself.

622
00:29:32,686 --> 00:29:35,686
<i>Salut.</i>

623
00:29:40,686 --> 00:29:43,685
Bill Shatner, uh, you are
one of our greatest actors.

624
00:29:43,686 --> 00:29:48,685
And I think I'm quoting you
correctly there, am I?

625
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:50,685
You--you are a legend.

626
00:29:50,686 --> 00:29:52,685
And again, I hate to be
a nitpicker,

627
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:53,685
but you misspelled
legend here.

628
00:29:53,686 --> 00:29:55,685
<i>It's L-E-G--</i>

629
00:29:55,686 --> 00:29:58,685
Good evening, Bill.

630
00:29:58,686 --> 00:30:02,685
Of course, in the famous
1968 episode of <i>Star Trek,</i>

631
00:30:02,686 --> 00:30:04,685
Billy boy and I shared

632
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:07,685
an on-screen kiss
that made history.

633
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:10,685
<i>And I'll never forget</i>

634
00:30:10,686 --> 00:30:13,685
what Bill said to me
after that kiss.

635
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:18,685
Eh, Sulu...uses...
more...tongue.

636
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:21,685
[laughter]

637
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:25,685
Now, Bill, what do you say?

638
00:30:25,686 --> 00:30:30,685
Let's make a little more
TV history.

639
00:30:30,686 --> 00:30:31,685
[cheers]

640
00:30:31,686 --> 00:30:33,685
And kiss my black ass.

641
00:30:33,686 --> 00:30:34,685
[laughter]

642
00:30:34,686 --> 00:30:35,685
(announcer)
Coming up...

643
00:30:35,686 --> 00:30:38,685
William Shatner
is not his real name.

644
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:39,685
(announcer)
Andy Dick.

645
00:30:39,686 --> 00:30:40,685
You'll know more later.

646
00:30:40,686 --> 00:30:42,686
(announcer)
Farrah Fawcett and Ben Stiller.

647
00:30:43,827 --> 00:30:45,826
Hey, Bill.
Ben Stiller here.

648
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,826
I got a call about
your big roast tonight.

649
00:30:47,827 --> 00:30:49,826
And they asked me if could
make some time to stop by.

650
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:52,826
And you know what?
No, I can't.

651
00:30:52,827 --> 00:30:53,826
Too busy.
Know why?

652
00:30:53,827 --> 00:30:56,826
Because in 1975,
you didn't make the time

653
00:30:56,827 --> 00:30:58,826
to send me the autographed
Captain Kirk picture

654
00:30:58,827 --> 00:31:00,826
that I wrote
and politely asked for.

655
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:03,826
Instead, you sent me
this letter.

656
00:31:03,827 --> 00:31:05,826
Which I saved.

657
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:07,826
And really actually
had a very...

658
00:31:07,827 --> 00:31:09,826
Very big impact on me.

659
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:12,826
"Dear Ben Shit-for-brains,

660
00:31:12,827 --> 00:31:15,826
nice fucking letter,
dick lick."

661
00:31:15,827 --> 00:31:17,826
I was ten.

662
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:19,826
<i>"I assume you wrote me</i>
<i>for an autograph,</i>

663
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:20,826
"but I'm not sure
because I can't read

664
00:31:20,827 --> 00:31:22,826
"one word of
your chicken scratch.

665
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:24,826
"Did you stick that crayon
in your ass

666
00:31:24,827 --> 00:31:25,826
and squat over the page?"

667
00:31:25,827 --> 00:31:28,826
How drunk were you
when you wrote this letter?

668
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:30,826
Huh?
In that hotel room?

669
00:31:30,827 --> 00:31:32,826
Surrounded by whores
and pills.

670
00:31:32,827 --> 00:31:34,826
And all the bad thoughts
that just couldn't be

671
00:31:34,827 --> 00:31:38,826
washed away by any
mind-altering substance.

672
00:31:38,827 --> 00:31:39,826
"Why don't you go grab
dad's crowbar

673
00:31:39,827 --> 00:31:41,826
"and pop your head
out of your ass

674
00:31:41,827 --> 00:31:43,826
and check out my new show
<i>Barbary Coast."</i>

675
00:31:43,827 --> 00:31:44,826
Oh, that was a gem.

676
00:31:44,827 --> 00:31:46,826
"It's about action
and adventure

677
00:31:46,827 --> 00:31:49,826
"in Old West San Francisco,
which is the perfect town

678
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:52,826
"for a mincy little tea bag

679
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,826
"Or better yet, save a stamp

00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:56,826
"It would make his day

some of you right back.

00:32:01,827 --> 00:32:03,826
"Warmest regards,
Bill Shatner.

CC: Gene Roddenberry."

685
00:32:05,827 --> 00:32:06,826
You know what, Bill?

686
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:09,826
I did contact Mr. Takei.
Yeah.

687
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,826
And he invited me over
to his place.

688
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:14,826
And then he told me his lap
was a transporter

689
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:16,826
and it would beam me
to heaven.

690
00:32:16,827 --> 00:32:19,826
So that worked out great
for me.

691
00:32:19,827 --> 00:32:23,827
Um...

692
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,826
Shame on you, Sulu.

693
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:27,826
Yeah, I know you're there.

694
00:32:27,827 --> 00:32:29,826
Shame on you.

695
00:32:29,827 --> 00:32:31,827
Don't look around,
'cause it's right here.

696
00:32:32,203 --> 00:32:34,826
And it's never
going away.

697
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,826
Um, seriously, Bill,
have a great night.

698
00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:38,454
You've always been
a hero of mine.

699
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:39,826
I'm a huge fan.

700
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,826
And in words of
one <i>Enterprise</i> crew member

701
00:32:41,827 --> 00:32:42,826
who doesn't wear a girdle,

702
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:47,827
live long and prosper.

703
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:52,826
Ladies and gentlemen,

704
00:32:52,827 --> 00:32:56,827
Farrah Fawcett
is here tonight.

705
00:33:00,827 --> 00:33:02,826
And she's here for
a very special reason.

706
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:04,826
She lives under the stage.

707
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:07,827
Ladies and gentlemen,
Farrah Fawcett!

708
00:33:17,827 --> 00:33:20,826
Wow.

709
00:33:20,827 --> 00:33:22,826
[laughing]

710
00:33:22,827 --> 00:33:26,826
I don't think
I can do this.

711
00:33:26,827 --> 00:33:31,826
Jason, can you
come back up here please?

712
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:32,826
I'm--sorry,
I changed my mind.

713
00:33:32,827 --> 00:33:34,826
I--I can't do this.

714
00:33:34,827 --> 00:33:36,826
What, you...

715
00:33:36,827 --> 00:33:38,826
I just--I can't be mean
to people.

716
00:33:38,827 --> 00:33:40,826
Oh, Farrah, it's easy.
Roasting someone is easy.

717
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:42,826
You just look 'em
in the eye

718
00:33:42,827 --> 00:33:45,827
and you say something mean
about them.

719
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:46,827
Like you're bald?

720
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:48,826
Yeah, not me.
Not me.

721
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:50,826
And beady-eyed.

722
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:51,826
No, Farrah, not me.
Not me.

723
00:33:51,827 --> 00:33:53,826
Now, listen, no, you're supposed
to go after Bill.

724
00:33:53,827 --> 00:33:54,826
Go after Bill.

725
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:55,826
But I...

726
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:58,826
I was always told
that if you can't

727
00:33:58,827 --> 00:33:59,826
say anything nice...

728
00:33:59,827 --> 00:34:02,826
don't say anything at all.
Really?

729
00:34:02,827 --> 00:34:03,826
Well...

730
00:34:03,827 --> 00:34:05,826
Well, okay, there was
one strange moment.

731
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:06,826
All right.

732
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:08,826
I was going into
the ladies' room,

733
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:11,826
Bill was coming out,
and I said,

734
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:14,826
"Bill, what were you
doing in there?

735
00:34:14,827 --> 00:34:17,826
And why are you looking
so bloated tonight?"

736
00:34:17,827 --> 00:34:18,826
And he said,
"My name's not Bill,

737
00:34:18,827 --> 00:34:20,826
it's Lisa Lamanetti.
Lam...

738
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:22,826
Oh, Lampanelli!
Yes!

739
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:23,826
Yes.

740
00:34:23,827 --> 00:34:25,826
<i>Yes.</i>

741
00:34:25,827 --> 00:34:26,826
<i>(Farrah)</i>
<i>I'm so s...I can't...</i>

742
00:34:26,827 --> 00:34:27,826
<i>(Jason)</i>
<i>No, you know what?</i>

743
00:34:27,827 --> 00:34:29,826
She was probably
so crocked at the time,

744
00:34:29,827 --> 00:34:31,826
she said "Lamanelli"
and, uh, yes.

745
00:34:31,827 --> 00:34:32,826
No, no, yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sure
that's what she said.

746
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:34,826
Lampanelli.
Wow.

747
00:34:34,827 --> 00:34:35,826
Sorry.

748
00:34:35,827 --> 00:34:36,826
I'm good, aren't I?

749
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,826
Yes, yes!
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

750
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:39,826
You're having fun, right?

751
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,826
Yeah, I probably won't
remember any of it.

752
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:45,826
That's right.
Tomorrow.

753
00:34:45,827 --> 00:34:48,826
No, I'm glad that you
got me to stay.

754
00:34:48,827 --> 00:34:49,826
It is my pleasure.
I'm glad you're here.

755
00:34:49,827 --> 00:34:52,826
Yeah.
I did it for you.

756
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:53,826
Of course.
Yeah.

757
00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:55,826
And all jokes aside,
I really think that

758
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,826
you're wonderful.
I do.

759
00:34:58,827 --> 00:34:59,826
And you and I
have a lot in common.

760
00:34:59,827 --> 00:35:02,826
We were both known
for our hair.

761
00:35:02,827 --> 00:35:03,826
And our boobs.

762
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:06,827
And we both
fucked Lee Majors.

763
00:35:08,827 --> 00:35:12,826
But, Bill, what I really...
and I do, appreciate,

764
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:13,826
is your singing.

765
00:35:13,827 --> 00:35:16,826
I loved your last CD,
<i>Has Been,</i>

766
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:18,826
which was
originally titled

767
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:21,826
<i>Has Been See...</i>

768
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:23,826
<i>Has Been...</i>
Okay.

769
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:27,826
<i>Has Been--</i>
Okay.

770
00:35:27,827 --> 00:35:27,827
<i>Do it again!</i>
Okay!

771
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:29,826
I really loved your CD.

772
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,826
It was originally titled...

773
00:35:32,827 --> 00:35:34,826
Okay, I'm not on anything.
I mean it.

774
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:35,826
Now, stop it right now.

775
00:35:35,827 --> 00:35:38,826
I can do this on the natch.
On the natch.

776
00:35:38,827 --> 00:35:40,826
Okay, I loved
your last CD.

777
00:35:40,827 --> 00:35:44,826
Which was originally titled
<i>Has Been Drinking Since Noon.</i>

778
00:35:44,827 --> 00:35:45,826
<i>Yeah!</i>
<i>There you go.</i>

779
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:48,827
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

780
00:35:51,827 --> 00:35:52,826
With your permission,

781
00:35:52,827 --> 00:35:55,826
I think we should
show some clips

782
00:35:55,827 --> 00:36:00,826
of your so-called
singing career performances.

783
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:01,826
Okay?

784
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,826
I do love you.

785
00:36:03,827 --> 00:36:06,826
She packed my bags...

786
00:36:06,827 --> 00:36:11,826
last night, pre-flight.

787
00:36:11,827 --> 00:36:16,827
Zero hour.
9:00 AM.

788
00:36:18,827 --> 00:36:21,827
And I'm gonna be...
high...

789
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:28,826

In a jingle...
jangle mornin'...

816
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:12,826
I'll come following you.

817
00:38:12,827 --> 00:38:13,826
Hey.

818
00:38:13,827 --> 00:38:16,827
Hey, Mr. Tambourine man.

819
00:38:20,827 --> 00:38:22,827
Mr. Tambourine man.

Mr. Tambourine man!

822
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,826
I took off
the Andy Dick costume,

823
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:56,826
and I got more comfortable.

824
00:38:56,827 --> 00:39:00,827
My real true name
is Andy Kock.

825
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:04,826
That's Kock with a K.

826
00:39:04,827 --> 00:39:07,826
It's actually a combination
of two names,

827
00:39:07,827 --> 00:39:10,826
Kirk and Spock.

828
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:11,826
<i>Confused?</i>

829
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:13,826
I brought
a little something

830
00:39:13,827 --> 00:39:14,826
that just might
shed some light.

831
00:39:14,827 --> 00:39:17,826
The actual Captain's Log.

832
00:39:17,827 --> 00:39:20,826
"I was just exiting
the shower tonight

833
00:39:20,827 --> 00:39:23,826
"when Spock
entered my quarters.

834
00:39:23,827 --> 00:39:26,826
"He stared at me hungrily.

835
00:39:26,827 --> 00:39:30,827
"Like Lieutenant Uhura
eyeing a plate of ribs."

836
00:39:32,827 --> 00:39:35,826
"I said, 'Spock!

837
00:39:35,827 --> 00:39:40,826
'Why aren't you...
manning... your post?'"

838
00:39:40,827 --> 00:39:42,827
That's the best
I can do.

839
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:47,286
"'Captain, when was
the last time

840
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:51,827
you had your
bunghole vulcanized?'"

had gone before."

"For a being

<i>"Spock did give me</i>

849
00:40:22,827 --> 00:40:25,826
"Then he fired off
his photon torpedoes

00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:30,826
Ladies and gentlemen,

852
00:40:30,827 --> 00:40:33,826
our...

853
00:40:33,827 --> 00:40:36,826
guest of honor...

854
00:40:36,827 --> 00:40:38,827
was impregnated.

855
00:40:40,827 --> 00:40:45,826
I am the illegitimate
butt baby

856
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:50,826
of Kirk and Spock.

857
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:52,826
Kock!

858
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:53,827
And, Mom?

859
00:40:57,827 --> 00:40:59,826
Even though
you abandoned me,

860
00:40:59,827 --> 00:41:04,826
I...I love you.

861
00:41:04,827 --> 00:41:08,827
And congratulations
on your big night.

862
00:41:09,827 --> 00:41:11,826
(announcer)
Coming up, Patton Oswalt.

863
00:41:11,827 --> 00:41:12,826
All right, sit down,
Courtney!

864
00:41:12,827 --> 00:41:14,827
Seriously, please--
oh, God!

865
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,975
You know, I just wanna
stop the show

866
00:41:20,976 --> 00:41:22,269
for a second
to say something.

867
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:23,975
Lisa, I am glad
you're here.

868
00:41:23,976 --> 00:41:27,975
<i>Last year Lisa Lampanelli</i>
<i>had a polyp</i>

869
00:41:27,976 --> 00:41:29,561
removed from her colon.

870
00:41:29,976 --> 00:41:31,975
And now I'd like to
introduce that polyp,

871
00:41:31,976 --> 00:41:33,728
Patton Oswalt,
ladies and gentlemen!

872
00:41:41,976 --> 00:41:44,975
I'm here
to talk about...

873
00:41:44,976 --> 00:41:47,975
William Shatner.

874
00:41:47,976 --> 00:41:50,975
Listen to that name.
Shatner!

875
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:52,975
Shatner sounds like

876
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:56,975
the barbaric yawp
of a Viking's cock

877
00:41:56,976 --> 00:41:58,975
as it splits a mighty elm
into kindling

878
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:01,975
that you build
a roaring bonfire

879
00:42:01,976 --> 00:42:05,975
and then cook meat over
that you fill your belly with

880
00:42:05,976 --> 00:42:09,976
after you ass rape
an ice giant.

881
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:16,975
That's what your name
sounds like.

882
00:42:16,976 --> 00:42:20,975
By the way, Andy, I saw that
new Jessica Simpson video.

883
00:42:20,976 --> 00:42:22,975
The one where
you lick the roller skate?

884
00:42:22,976 --> 00:42:27,975
I never thought I'd feel bad
for a roller skate.

885
00:42:27,976 --> 00:42:28,975
<i>What the...</i>

886
00:42:28,976 --> 00:42:29,975
All right,
sit down, Courtney.

887
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:32,975
Seriously, please.
Oh, God.

888
00:42:32,976 --> 00:42:35,975
Oh, Jesus Christ!

889
00:42:35,976 --> 00:42:38,975
Wow!

890
00:42:38,976 --> 00:42:40,976
See you in ten years,
erections.

891
00:42:50,976 --> 00:42:51,975
Cable Ace nominee
Kevin Pollak,

892
00:42:51,976 --> 00:42:52,976
ladies and gentlemen,
right over there.

893
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:58,975
<i>Used to, uh...</i>

894
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,975
Former host of
<i>Celebrity Poker Showdown.</i>

895
00:43:00,976 --> 00:43:02,975
How the fuck do you
get fired from a job

896
00:43:02,976 --> 00:43:04,975
where all you gotta do
is say, "Nice fold, Coolio"?

897
00:43:04,976 --> 00:43:07,975
How does that happen?

898
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:08,976
Good God.

899
00:43:11,976 --> 00:43:13,975
Carrie Fisher.

900
00:43:13,976 --> 00:43:15,975
Carrie Fisher,
ladies and gentlemen.

901
00:43:15,976 --> 00:43:17,975
As a nerd,

902
00:43:17,976 --> 00:43:19,976
<i>you really are...</i>

903
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:22,975
In that gold bikini
in <i>Return of the Jedi.</i>

904
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:24,975
Jesus God in heaven.

905
00:43:24,976 --> 00:43:25,975
Wow!

906
00:43:25,976 --> 00:43:29,975
<i>Yes.</i>

907
00:43:29,976 --> 00:43:30,976
<i>Yeah.</i>

908
00:43:33,976 --> 00:43:35,976
<i>Oh, jeez.</i>

909
00:43:42,976 --> 00:43:46,976
You just got a kiss
from Jabba the fag.

910
00:43:48,976 --> 00:43:51,975
You are so... so good
in that gold bikini.

911
00:43:51,976 --> 00:43:52,976
And then what happened?

912
00:43:53,976 --> 00:43:54,975
When they yelled "cut"
did you have

913
00:43:54,976 --> 00:43:57,976
a Vicodin-eating contest
with Chewbacca?

914
00:43:59,976 --> 00:44:02,975
Take it from a nerd,
let the wookie win, okay?

915
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:04,975
I feel very good
about that joke

916
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,975
because the message board
I tried it out on

917
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:09,975
gave me an LMFAOW...

918
00:44:09,976 --> 00:44:15,975
uh, IHAP, uh, FEF...
um...

919
00:44:15,976 --> 00:44:19,975
AAMM, uh, IMD,

920
00:44:19,976 --> 00:44:26,975
um, YAMIRDMR, uh...FBNA,

921
00:44:26,976 --> 00:44:28,975
which as Brian Posehn'll
tell you means

922
00:44:28,976 --> 00:44:30,975
Laughing
My Figurative Ass Off

923
00:44:30,976 --> 00:44:32,975

925
00:44:34,976 --> 00:44:37,976

<i>Fly By Night</i> Album.

926
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:49,975
George Takei
came out of the closet.

927
00:44:49,976 --> 00:44:51,975
By the way, when you
came out of the closet,

928
00:44:51,976 --> 00:44:53,975
did the door go...
<i>[Enterprise</i> door sound]

929
00:44:53,976 --> 00:44:56,976
<i>when that happened?</i>

930
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:01,975
Farrah Fawcett,
you look so hot tonight.

931
00:45:01,976 --> 00:45:04,976
I'm serious, you are
so smoking hot.

932
00:45:05,976 --> 00:45:06,975
You really are.

933
00:45:06,976 --> 00:45:07,975
Although, keep in mind,

934
00:45:07,976 --> 00:45:10,976
batshit crazy
gives me a boner, so...

935
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,976
Although--what the...

936
00:45:24,976 --> 00:45:26,975
Why do I feel like
Courtney Love

937
00:45:26,976 --> 00:45:30,976
killed Andy Dick
and put his skin on?

938
00:45:38,976 --> 00:45:39,975
Lisa Lampanelli.

939
00:45:39,976 --> 00:45:41,975
The queen of mean.

940
00:45:41,976 --> 00:45:46,976
Or as the kids call you,
the insult comic dog.

941
00:45:47,976 --> 00:45:50,975
Lisa Lampanelli has fucked
more black men

942
00:45:50,976 --> 00:45:52,976
than the Tuskegee experiments.

943
00:45:54,976 --> 00:45:56,975
Don't groan at that,
she does very well.

944
00:45:56,976 --> 00:45:59,975
Do you know how much bling
gets left in Lisa's snatch?

945
00:45:59,976 --> 00:46:02,975
<i>It's like a pawn show</i>
<i>down there.</i>

946
00:46:02,976 --> 00:46:06,976
Yesterday Carlos Mencia
tried to rob it.

947
00:46:12,976 --> 00:46:15,976
Luckily, he passed out
from the smell.

948
00:46:16,976 --> 00:46:17,975
William, look--

949
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:19,975
I didn't really pick
on you that much.

950
00:46:19,976 --> 00:46:21,975
As a nerd, it really
is a big deal

951
00:46:21,976 --> 00:46:22,975
for me to be up here.

952
00:46:22,976 --> 00:46:24,975
It's hard for me to write
anything mean about you.

953
00:46:24,976 --> 00:46:26,975
This means a lot to me.

954
00:46:26,976 --> 00:46:28,975
I'm gonna go now.

955
00:46:28,976 --> 00:46:29,975
But before I leave,

956
00:46:29,976 --> 00:46:31,975
just settle a bet
for me and my friends.

957
00:46:31,976 --> 00:46:32,975
Could you, uh...

958
00:46:32,976 --> 00:46:36,975
Could you act your way out
of this for me really quick?

959
00:46:36,976 --> 00:46:37,975
<i>No?</i>

960
00:46:37,976 --> 00:46:38,975
Folks, thank you very much.

961
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:40,976
And thank you,
William Shatner.

Coming up, George Takei

963
00:46:46,976 --> 00:46:47,975
and Lisa Lampanelli.

964
00:46:47,976 --> 00:46:50,976
I thought you dated Lance.

965
00:46:53,147 --> 00:46:57,146
They say behind every
great man is a great woman.

966
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,147
Unless you're our next guest.

967
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,146
Behind him is another
creepy old gay dude.

968
00:47:01,147 --> 00:47:03,146
George Takei,
ladies and gentlemen!

969
00:47:03,147 --> 00:47:04,147
Georgie!

970
00:47:10,147 --> 00:47:15,146
I've got a few things to say
about this bloated,

971
00:47:15,147 --> 00:47:22,146
washed up, pathetic,
no talent, bald hack.

972
00:47:22,147 --> 00:47:25,147
Jason, great job tonight.

973
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:34,147
And a great job
last night too.

974
00:47:41,147 --> 00:47:42,147
[clears throat]

975
00:47:44,147 --> 00:47:48,146
Look at all the talent
we have in this room tonight.

976
00:47:48,147 --> 00:47:50,146
Farrah Fawcett, Betty White,

977
00:47:50,147 --> 00:47:54,146
Lisa Lampanelli.

978
00:47:54,147 --> 00:47:58,147
It smells like pussy
in here.

979
00:48:02,147 --> 00:48:07,147
I think.

980
00:48:12,147 --> 00:48:16,146
Andy Dick is here tonight.

981
00:48:16,147 --> 00:48:18,146
As a fellow gay man,

982
00:48:18,147 --> 00:48:21,146
<i>even I have to say</i>

983
00:48:21,147 --> 00:48:25,147
Andy, tone it down a little.

984
00:48:27,147 --> 00:48:29,146
And I have to say
a special hello

985
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:32,147
to my cuddly muffin,
Artie Lange.

986
00:48:36,147 --> 00:48:40,146
Speaking of fat alcoholics...

987
00:48:40,147 --> 00:48:42,147
Good evening, Bill.

988
00:48:44,147 --> 00:48:47,146
My name is George Takei.

989
00:48:47,147 --> 00:48:50,146
Not <i>Tak"eye",</i> as you've insisted
on pronouncing it

990
00:48:50,147 --> 00:48:53,147
for the last 40 years.

991
00:48:56,147 --> 00:49:01,147
Remember--Takei,
like in toupee.

992
00:49:04,147 --> 00:49:06,146
<i>All night long,</i>

993
00:49:06,147 --> 00:49:12,146
I've had to stare at that
tangled, sticky, messy

994
00:49:12,147 --> 00:49:14,147
clump of fur.

995
00:49:15,147 --> 00:49:17,147
Farrah, please
close your legs!

996
00:49:18,147 --> 00:49:19,146
[laughter]

997
00:49:19,147 --> 00:49:21,146
Oh, no.

998
00:49:21,147 --> 00:49:23,147
Oh, no.

999
00:49:25,147 --> 00:49:29,147
At least Betty White
had the decency to shave.

1000
00:49:36,147 --> 00:49:38,146
Bill, there are
so many things about you

1001
00:49:38,147 --> 00:49:40,146
that I can make fun of.

1002
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:43,146
Like your...acting.

1003
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:48,147
Your acting is the only thing
that makes me want to gag.

1004
00:49:51,147 --> 00:49:53,146
<i>If I could only get my partner</i>

1005
00:49:53,147 --> 00:49:58,147
to suck that hard,
I'd never leave my chateau.

1006
00:50:06,147 --> 00:50:09,146
Of course,
I'm only kidding, Bill.

1007
00:50:09,147 --> 00:50:13,146
Bill is a generous actor.

1008
00:50:13,147 --> 00:50:15,147
He gave Nichelle Nichols
herpes.

1009
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:22,147
[George laughs]

1010
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,146
Ladies and gentlemen,

1011
00:50:27,147 --> 00:50:28,147
the first--
Give me a kiss.

1012
00:50:47,147 --> 00:50:52,146
But if Artie's
my cuddly muffin, Bill,

1013
00:50:52,147 --> 00:50:56,146
you are a rich, gooey
Devil's food cake

1014
00:50:56,147 --> 00:50:59,146

into and go...

[makes raspberry sounds]

1016
00:51:14,147 --> 00:51:16,146
So...

1017
00:51:16,147 --> 00:51:18,146
despite our tensions,

1018
00:51:18,147 --> 00:51:20,146
I am honored that
you invited me

1019
00:51:20,147 --> 00:51:22,146
to be here with you tonight.

1020
00:51:22,147 --> 00:51:29,146
I can finally say what I've
waited 40 years to say.

1021
00:51:29,147 --> 00:51:33,147
Fuck you,
and the horse you rode in on!

1022
00:51:42,147 --> 00:51:45,147

Be kind.

If you can't be kind,
be lousy.

1026
00:52:03,225 --> 00:52:06,224
Our final roaster gave up
a promising football career

1027
00:52:06,225 --> 00:52:08,224
to become a horrible comedian.

I've always wanted to see

1040

William Shatner sing <i>Rocket Man,</i>

1073
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:33,224
Betty White is so old

1074
00:54:33,225 --> 00:54:35,224
that on her first game show
ever,

1075
00:54:35,225 --> 00:54:38,224

is our guest of honor.

1091
00:55:51,225 --> 00:55:55,224
Mr. Shatner has starred in some
amazing television shows.

1092

one of them.

1093
00:55:59,225 --> 00:56:01,224
What a piece of crap.

1094
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:03,224
I tried to TiVo <i>T.J Hooker,</i>

1095
00:56:03,225 --> 00:56:06,225
but my TiVo suggested
I punch myself in the cunt.

1096
00:56:13,225 --> 00:56:17,224
In closing, I would like
to thank you, William Shatner,

1097
00:56:17,225 --> 00:56:20,224
for letting me
make fun of you tonight.

1098
00:56:20,225 --> 00:56:23,224
You are an icon
who is loved the world over.

1099
00:56:23,225 --> 00:56:27,224
And you're an inspiration
to performers everywhere.

1100
00:56:27,225 --> 00:56:30,224
William Shatner
is living proof

1101
00:56:30,225 --> 00:56:33,224

and nice,

1102
00:56:33,225 --> 00:56:36,224
you can work forever
in this business.

1103

01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:36,495
so if you guys like sound
and one camera,

1229
01:02:36,496 --> 01:02:39,495
I could do something
out of my house.

1230
01:02:39,496 --> 01:02:41,495
It might work.

1231
01:02:41,496 --> 01:02:43,495
There's three black guys
with camera equipment.

1232
01:02:43,496 --> 01:02:45,495
Like this shit
ain't stolen.

1233
01:02:45,496 --> 01:02:47,495
Yeah, I'm sorry, Bill.
They made me do it.

1234
01:02:47,496 --> 01:02:48,495
Thank you.

1235
01:02:48,496 --> 01:02:50,495
I took it like a man.

1236
01:02:50,496 --> 01:02:52,495
If anybody needs
to apologize to anybody,

1237
01:02:52,496 --> 01:02:54,495
he should apologize
for making me do this.

1238
01:02:54,496 --> 01:02:56,495
Piece of crap.
I never liked them.

1239
01:02:56,496 --> 01:02:58,495
Thank you!
I'll see you outside.
