1
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:52,431
They say that starting a family
is an act of optimism.

2
00:00:52,507 --> 00:00:57,329
Well, Tom and I were clearly
very, very, very optimistic.

3
00:00:57,403 --> 00:01:00,698
There are always good times
and difficult ones along the way.

4
00:01:00,764 --> 00:01:03,960
And with 12 kids, you learn a lot of lessons.

5
00:01:04,027 --> 00:01:08,849
But the one that you never get used to is that
moment when you look your child in the eye

6
00:01:08,923 --> 00:01:14,619
and find yourself having to say
the most difficult word of all: Goodbye.

7
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:17,302
All right, stay together.

8
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:34,841
There she is.

9
00:01:35,036 --> 00:01:37,109
Sergio Archer.

10
00:01:38,588 --> 00:01:41,108
Look, she's right there.

11
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:44,985
Robert Armstrong.

12
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:48,567
Peter Bailey.

13
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:55,925
Lorraine Baker.

14
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:20,824
- He's really gotten good.
- Yeah.

15
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:26,293
My gosh. Kicking, kicking.

16
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:49,108
All right, all right.
It is time to toast the graduate.

17
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,027
Lorraine,

18
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,231
we are all so proud of you,

19
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:01,913
for keeping your chin up
and charging the mountain.

20
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:10,170
And for being a truly unique
and wonderful person.

21
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:15,354
And for getting that internship at Allure
magazine. Did you know about that?

22
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:21,467
Even though I'll be trying to convince you
staying here is a better choice for your future

23
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:27,098
than moving to dirty, expensive, crime-ridden
New York City, but here's to Lorraine.

24
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:32,313
OK. My daughter Nora and her husband Bud,
you wanna say something?

25
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:36,026
And our future linebacker.
We go. Let's go.

26
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,040
First of all, congratulations, Lorraine.

27
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,590
Bud and I hope that our baby
will be as cool and accomplished as you.

28
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:50,418
And second of all, I don't mean
to make this toast all about Bud and I,

29
00:03:50,494 --> 00:03:54,455
- but we have some kind of big news.
- You know about this?

30
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:59,512
I've just been offered the vice-presidency
of a new advertising firm.

31
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:02,516
Hey! Congratulations. Yeah!

32
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:05,076
In Houston.

33
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,514
We're moving in September. Thank you.

34
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:13,556
Great. Wow.

35
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:20,980
- Does this mean we won't be uncles?
- You'll be uncles no matter where we live.

36
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:23,901
Maybe they thought
it was the best way to break it to us.

37
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:27,348
- Quite a surprise.
- I'll say. Can I get a beer and a white wine?

38
00:04:27,422 --> 00:04:29,626
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

39
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:33,207
- I feel like I'm losing two daughters now.
- You're not losing us.

40
00:04:33,278 --> 00:04:37,020
I hope you have help, 'cause with no family
there and you being a first-time mom...

41
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:40,698
- You'll be at work all day...
- I'm not gonna be at work all the time.

42
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:45,174
We're gonna be fine. And whatever house
we get is gonna have a room reserved for you.

43
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:48,213
At least you're gonna stay
for the touch football game.

44
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:51,134
- We can't. We have Lamaze.
- This will help your breathing.

45
00:04:51,198 --> 00:04:53,205
We're gonna see you soon.

46
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:56,028
You're driving, right?

47
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:59,356
- See you.
- Bye, sweetheart. There you go, sir.

48
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:01,235
That's...

49
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,318
They seem so casual and cavalier.

50
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,325
Well, time for me to get my hands dirty.

51
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:10,075
You're working? What about the game?
Rematch against the cousins.

52
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,793
I've got student loans to pay off, Dad.

53
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:16,862
- OK. See you.
- Be safe, honey.

54
00:05:16,926 --> 00:05:20,123
Did everybody forget touch football
was a tradition here?

55
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,671
- Honey, you've got ten other kids to draft.
- I forgot.

56
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:25,368
- You forgot?
- Lorraine.

57
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:28,759
- Staying for the game?
- No, didn't Mom tell you?

58
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,408
I'm spending the weekend at Beth's.
I leave in five minutes. Love you.

59
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,129
Bye. Hey, guys. Ready for some touch?

60
00:05:35,198 --> 00:05:40,600
- Mike and I are competing at the skate park.
- I volunteered at the animal shelter.

61
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,398
Nigel, Kyle, football.

62
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,822
All right.

63
00:05:52,543 --> 00:05:56,601
- I'm here, Coach.
- You just made the varsity, little lady.

64
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:59,191
Come on. There you go.
Go, go, go!

65
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:01,914
- I'll block for you. Here we go. Go!
- Athletes!

66
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:05,845
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

67
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,400
Somehow I thought it'd get easier.

68
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:14,392
Ten minutes ago, they were all over us. Now
they don't want to be seen with us in public.

69
00:06:14,463 --> 00:06:18,424
- What's that doing here?
- I bet Lorraine was looking through this.

70
00:06:18,496 --> 00:06:20,503
That's sweet.

71
00:06:23,136 --> 00:06:25,689
The cutest. Look at her.

72
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,313
She looks just like my mom.

73
00:06:28,384 --> 00:06:30,391
A lot of memories.

74
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:32,602
Summers in Wisconsin.

75
00:06:32,671 --> 00:06:36,828
Swimming. All of us camping out.
Everyone together. Isn't that sweet?

76
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:40,757
That had to be the last time we were there.
What was it? Three or four years ago?

77
00:06:40,831 --> 00:06:45,054
- Look at Sarah. No teeth.
- We were one tight unit back then.

78
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,055
Even if we never beat the Murtaughs
for the Labor Day Cup.

79
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:51,543
Look at that.
Jimmy Murtaugh - Mr Competitive.

80
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:55,544
He was so desperate to win,
he would... he would win.

81
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,715
All the time.
Even when we were kids, this guy was...

82
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:01,850
All right, honey. Let's not go there.

83
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,005
You know what?
That's exactly what we should do.

84
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:10,454
Go back to the lake. The whole family
on vacation, like we used to.

85
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:13,528
I could call Mike Romanow
and see if the house is available.

86
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,397
It's a great idea, but the kids
are in summer school and Nora's pregnant.

87
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:21,563
That's exactly why we should do it, Kate.
We said it. Life's blazing by.

88
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:24,731
Let's go back to the lake one last time.

89
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:28,057
We did have such good times there, honey.

90
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:31,739
You and I had alone time, which was nice.

91
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:33,848
There's the proof.

92
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:37,915
- Hey, Gunner.
- Hey, Gunner.

93
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:40,799
Let's call Mike Romanow, honey.

94
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,678
You're conferencing
with all of us and Lorraine.

95
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:49,752
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, guys. What's up?

96
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:52,061
- It's Lorraine.
- We have a surprise.

97
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:54,462
We rented the big house up in Lake Winnetka.

98
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:57,398
- Winnetka? That's my middle name.
- And Lake is mine.

99
00:07:57,473 --> 00:08:02,012
And it's where we're gonna spend Labor Day,
just like in the old days.

100
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,469
Dad, I'm gonna be very pregnant then.

101
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:07,774
And I'm gonna be apartment hunting
in New York in August.

102
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,095
- I wanna hang out with my friends.
- How come we're named after a house?

103
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:15,958
Good question. Your middle name is
Winnetka and your middle name is Lake

104
00:08:16,032 --> 00:08:19,032
- 'cause you were conceived there.
- What does "conceived" mean?

105
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:23,742
- It means Mom and Dad...
- Had a conversation that we'd discuss it later.

106
00:08:23,808 --> 00:08:26,710
Kyle and me will go anyplace
that has our name on it.

107
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:29,403
- Bingo! Come on.
- Yeah. I love the lake. I'm in.

108
00:08:29,472 --> 00:08:32,472
- I guess I can cancel a couple of gigs.
- Bingo!

109
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,974
- OK, we're in.
- All right.

110
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,056
We agree to participate.

111
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:38,617
We'll bring the wakeboards
and totally dominate.

112
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:42,944
- OK, we're in.
- All right! And that leaves Lorraine.

113
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:46,522
- Come on. You'll have fun.
- Come on, Lorraine. Just come.

114
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:49,113
All right, here's the deal. I'll go to the lake

115
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:52,152
if Dad stops nagging me
about not going to New York.

116
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:54,778
Deal. That's a dozen. We're going to the lake.

117
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,886
- Who cut the cheese?
- Gunner farted.

118
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:24,632
We'll drive up tomorrow
or the next day.

119
00:09:24,705 --> 00:09:27,934
- You missed.
- I love you too. Bye.

120
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:31,744
Lorraine's got a line on a place.
She and Charlie will come in a couple of days.

121
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,382
Couple of days? The whole point of the
vacation is that the whole family is together.

122
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,457
Honey, relax.

123
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:44,190
All right. Remember this?
Look at the lake. It looks fantastic.

124
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:47,105
- Does it look great or what?
- Come on, kids.

125
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,658
All right. Slide out. Hurry up.

126
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,742
Everyone out. Come on.
Let's check the place out.

127
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:56,857
- Look at it.
- This is it?

128
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,963
- Remember this?
- It looks smaller.

129
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:03,579
- And more disgusting.
- Yeah. Why can't we rent that place?

130
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,497
Well, that place is new.

131
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:10,653
- This place is...
- Older, but still nice.

132
00:10:10,722 --> 00:10:16,472
Yeah. And that might have a water slide,
but our place has...

133
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:18,750
There's stairs. They're fun.

134
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:22,615
So unload, camper dudes! Girls in
the north bunk room, boys in the south.

135
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:25,025
- Bud and Nora in the loft. Come on!
- Careful.

136
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,287
Hey, Bud, give the phone a rest.
We're on vacation.

137
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:30,623
Hey. How did Mad Dog like the trip?

138
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,276
Maybe the baby's
not gonna be a "Mad Dog," Tom.

139
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:37,438
But that's a classic linebacker name.
OK, how about Dick Butkus McNulty?

140
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:41,281
- Maybe it's gonna be a girl, Dad.
- Donna Butkus McNulty.

141
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:44,608
- We got all vacation to pick a name.
- Someone's here.

142
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:47,227
- Mike Romanow. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

143
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:51,161
Everything OK? Shouldn't be too
disorganized, only two renters this season.

144
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:54,748
- The lake's a lot more upscale.
- Thank Jimmy Murtaugh. Remember him?

145
00:10:54,819 --> 00:10:56,957
- Yeah.
- He owns most of the lake now.

146
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:59,132
That's his place over there.

147
00:10:59,586 --> 00:11:01,561
Well, good for Jimmy.

148
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,788
- Hey, remember Kate?
- Hey, Mike. How are you?

149
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:07,517
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

150
00:11:07,587 --> 00:11:10,903
If you don't feel like cooking,
there's a clambake up at the club.

151
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:12,986
- You can come as my guests.
- Guests?

152
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:16,671
Yeah. Club's private now.
And renovated.

153
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:20,154
- Homeowners only. Put you on the list?
- OK.

154
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,265
- What's going on?
- Stop!

155
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:29,916
The Chiseler.

156
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:33,184
- Tell me those aren't my keys.
- Get him outside, OK?

157
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:37,474
- I remember how to handle this guy.
- I can't believe he's still alive.

158
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:40,572
- You know that thing?
- Hey.

159
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:43,483
- Don't hurt him.
- I got it. I got it.

160
00:11:43,555 --> 00:11:47,384
It's a snap. Here you go. Hold still. Yeah.

161
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:56,226
Leave him alone!

162
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,713
Gunner! Stay! Stay, Gunner!

163
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:01,308
- Get him.
- Gunner, stay!

164
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:04,930
Mom, watch out!

165
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:14,523
Don't light the fireworks.

166
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:19,703
- No explosives in the house!
- Nigel! Kyle!

167
00:12:25,924 --> 00:12:27,517
Gunner, come back.

168
00:12:32,644 --> 00:12:35,164
- What was that beast?
- The Chiseler?

169
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:37,308
A pack rat. Steals stuff and hides it.

170
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,380
- I'll get a trap in the morning.
- A humane trap, right?

171
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:43,037
You know what?
We got a fantastic first day going.

172
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:48,924
So let's clean up and unpack,
'cause we got a clambake to go to! Clambake!

173
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,865
- OK, here we go. What is all this stuff?
- I'm going as fast as I can.

174
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:55,747
I should put more sugar in your diets,
get you moving.

175
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:57,917
You actually bought that shirt?

176
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:03,836
Every dad is entitled to one hideous shirt and
one horrible sweater. It's part of the dad code.

177
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,810
- Mark, you're on fireworks detail.
- OK.

178
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,682
- What's all that?
- Nothing.

179
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,185
Seatbelts.

180
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:16,313
OK, kids. You know the rules.

181
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:23,329
I'm underdressed. I thought this
was supposed to be a clambake.

182
00:13:23,396 --> 00:13:25,600
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

183
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:28,603
- Hey, guys. So glad you could come.
- Hi, Mike.

184
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:31,677
Good to see you.
Listen. Kids, food's downstairs.

185
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:34,269
Mom, Dad, the bar is there.
Have a great time.

186
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:37,156
- Best behavior.
- Stick together. Keep an eye on them.

187
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:39,195
- Food.
- See you later.

188
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:48,414
- Lloyd, how are you?
- Good to see you, Jimmy.

189
00:13:48,485 --> 00:13:51,168
There's Jimmy Murtaugh!
Engage me in conversation.

190
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:56,058
- We are talking.
- I know, but more intense so he won't come.

191
00:13:57,284 --> 00:14:02,172
- Just hide your face.
- Well, that's a little obvious.

192
00:14:02,244 --> 00:14:04,132
- Tom!
- Turn.

193
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:08,932
My goodness.
Look what the wind blew in.

194
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:10,852
- Hey!
- Jimmy!

195
00:14:11,909 --> 00:14:15,170
- Tom. Look at you.
- How are you?

196
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:21,052
Wow, you're looking good. A little wrinkled
around the edges, but not bad for an old man.

197
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:23,743
- And you.
- Kate.

198
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:28,352
Kate. Still looking very hot for a mother of 12.

199
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:32,098
- What brings you guys back to my lake?
- Your lake? Your lake now?

200
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:36,671
Well, you know, I just have to buy Romanow's
place and one or two other properties.

201
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:41,051
And then I can keep
the riff-raff like you outta here.

202
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:45,722
I'm sorry, honey.
Tom and Kate, this is Sarina, my new bride.

203
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:48,186
- Nice to meet you, Sarina.
- Nice to meet you.

204
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,360
The parents of that family of pranksters
I told you about.

205
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:56,066
Jimmy's always been jealous 'cause we have
12 kids and he has eight. A manhood thing.

206
00:14:56,134 --> 00:15:00,411
Well, your 12 never beat my eight
for the cup, now, did they, Tom?

207
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:03,203
- Well, no, they didn't.
- Is that why you came back?

208
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:08,572
- Trying to knock my family off the wall?
- No. We actually just came for a vacation.

209
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:11,874
- Come on. Buy me a drink.
- Buy you a drink? Mr Lake?

210
00:15:14,374 --> 00:15:17,603
Jake Baker? Eliot Murtaugh.

211
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,223
No way. Dude, it's Eliot Murtaugh.

212
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:24,315
- That's Mike.
- Hey, Mike.

213
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,260
That's such a cool stick.
Can you bang any tricks?

214
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,668
Yeah. Check it.

215
00:15:31,846 --> 00:15:33,755
Awesome!

216
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:41,440
- I'll have clams, please.
- Sorry, there's no clams.

217
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,965
We have some clam fritters.

218
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:47,900
So this clambake is clamless?
Then why notjust call it a buffet?

219
00:15:47,974 --> 00:15:52,317
- I feel like a stranger on this planet.
- I couldn't agree with you more.

220
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:58,657
So, Tom, I read you quit the head coaching
gig at Illinois Poly. What was that all about?

221
00:15:58,726 --> 00:16:02,272
It took up a lot of hours and I wanted
to spend more time with the family.

222
00:16:02,342 --> 00:16:04,164
- Kudos.
- Thank you.

223
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,427
- That's my word for the day.
- How fun. It's fun to have a word.

224
00:16:07,494 --> 00:16:12,644
So, Katie, I guess with Tom at home changing
diapers, you're tearing up the bestseller list.

225
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,165
I only had the one book,
but I would love to...

226
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:19,842
Excuse me. Waiter.
Another Scotch, por favor. Anybody else?

227
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:23,107
- I'm fine.
- Hey, what about Charlie? Still playing ball?

228
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:26,208
No. He's living downtown
and he's working in a garage

229
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,700
to pay tuition
to the University of Chicago.

230
00:16:28,774 --> 00:16:32,123
I did a guest spot on Monster Garage
back when I was acting.

231
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:35,678
And I just love
the whole engine-and-cars thing.

232
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,816
- So you're an actress. That's great.
- Thank you, Tom.

233
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:41,734
- You're welcome, Sarina.
- Kudos.

234
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:48,294
- How long have you two been married?
- Six amazing months.

235
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:51,294
- Right, honey?
- Happy anniversary.

236
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:55,709
There's Mike, Jake and Sarah. They compete
in skating contests on a regular basis.

237
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:58,685
- See you.
- Hey! Sarah!

238
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:04,094
That's good. You gotta start with
the small steps before you take the big ones.

239
00:17:05,543 --> 00:17:07,648
- Mark Baker?
- Kenny the maniac!

240
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:10,206
Well, if it isn't my partner in crime.

241
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,054
- You're gonna get in trouble, Murtaugh.
- Only if I get caught, Baker.

242
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:16,989
Come here. I wanna show you something.

243
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:21,187
- Please don't get me in trouble like last time.
- You worry too much.

244
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:22,717
How are your kids?

245
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,435
I've got three at a private school
for gifted children in Lake Forest.

246
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,511
Two at Andover, one at Exeter.

247
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:34,083
Calvin's at Yale finishing up a field study in
particle physics. Generating a lot of interest.

248
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:38,242
Eliot was in Sports Illustrated.
Just won the snowboarding junior nationals.

249
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:41,181
- Slope style.
- Well, that was no surprise.

250
00:17:41,255 --> 00:17:43,808
But I gotta say, Anne's still my superstar.

251
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:48,636
When she finishes her MBA at Harvard, she's
gonna work for me at Murtaugh Enterprises.

252
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:50,686
Definitely corporate material.

253
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:56,579
Something reeks.

254
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:12,159
Get out of the way!

255
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,695
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

256
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:26,558
Look out. She's gonna blow!

257
00:18:48,872 --> 00:18:50,399
Cool.

258
00:18:50,472 --> 00:18:54,117
Listen, mister, accident or not,
you'll be taking the garbage out,

259
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:56,322
or something you don't wanna do,
for 30 days.

260
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:59,938
So sit down, please. Everyone, quiet. For me.

261
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:04,896
Parenting comes down to one word - "push."
If you don't push, they don't do anything.

262
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:09,540
- I think it's a little more complicated.
- Is it?

263
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:14,343
"Most went through periods in their life when
they worried about making car payments."

264
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:17,092
- Hey! Gotcha!
- Yeah.

265
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:19,975
Nigel, leave Kyle's pants alone!

266
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:23,654
Look, no one was hurt. It's fine.

267
00:19:23,721 --> 00:19:26,819
In fact, why don't you come over
to The Boulders sometime?

268
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:28,928
- The Boulders?
- Our cottage.

269
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,171
We would love to do that sometime...

270
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,780
Hey, kids, why don't you leave the fireworks
at home? You're all welcome at our place.

271
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:38,882
We've got Seadoos, lasers, wireless internet,

272
00:19:38,952 --> 00:19:43,524
plasma screens, satellite TVs,
all the toys and whistles.

273
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:47,008
You know what? Actually, we're here
for quality time with the kids.

274
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,244
Come on, it's time to go.
We've done enough damage here.

275
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:53,728
- So we'll probably see you on the lake.
- Sure. Another time.

276
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,997
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you too.

277
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:00,327
Good seeing you again, Tom.
You too...

278
00:20:00,393 --> 00:20:02,335
- Kate.
- Kate.

279
00:20:04,873 --> 00:20:09,150
Boy, you know, when we were kids,
I used to be so envious of Tom Baker.

280
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:11,461
He just had it all.

281
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:17,126
Well, I guess the Gucci loafer's
on the other foot now, isn't it?

282
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,735
- Everyone, straight to bed.
- What a moron.

283
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,143
- He's our son.
- Not Mark, he's a kid.

284
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:26,023
Murtaugh. "Seems like you
could use the word 'push'."

285
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:28,740
Next time we see him,
let's agree to ignore him.

286
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,803
- There's not gonna be a next time.
- I don't know if the kids will agree.

287
00:20:32,873 --> 00:20:36,932
You think that water slide could compete
with the tire swing I'm gonna put up?

288
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,976
Rise and shine! Daylight's burning.

289
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,408
It is breakfast at the Bakers', day one!

290
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:44,862
Come on, sleepy heads.

291
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:49,061
Is there a particular reason
that we're eating breakfast outside?

292
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:54,148
- 'Cause it's a beautiful day at Lake Winnetka.
- It's vacation, sweetheart.

293
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:59,553
And there's the rest of the clan. Come on.
Hey, guys. Hey, guys, look.

294
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:02,408
Hey! Welcome to the land o' plenty.

295
00:21:02,473 --> 00:21:08,932
It still smells the same here. Like dead leaves,
unwashed animals and murky lake water.

296
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,751
- It's called fresh air, sweetheart.
- Watch the hat.

297
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:13,475
- Hey, guys.
- Come on, let's eat.

298
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:17,058
We're gonna need a forklift
to get Lorraine's suitcase outta here.

299
00:21:17,162 --> 00:21:20,774
What have I been here, 30 seconds,
and you're already making fun of me?

300
00:21:20,842 --> 00:21:23,297
Yeah, that was my foot.

301
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,784
- Is that suitcase just for make-up?
- Whatever, Butch.

302
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,647
Big breakfast, everybody, so you
have enough room for family activities.

303
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:36,064
- Family activities?
- Appleschmear. Fishing for Big Daddy.

304
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:38,309
The tire swing, the diving board.

305
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:40,767
- I'm boarding.
- Kenneth has video games.

306
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:45,479
We were gonna use the Murtaughs' internet
to research for the academic decathlon.

307
00:21:45,546 --> 00:21:47,685
Precisely. We need the extra hours.

308
00:21:47,754 --> 00:21:50,536
Well, you got all vacation
to go over to that place.

309
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:53,602
We have all vacation
to do the family activities too.

310
00:21:53,674 --> 00:21:56,456
Sarah, what about you?
You wanna hang out with Dad?

311
00:21:56,523 --> 00:22:00,232
Actually, I was gonna go boarding with Jake.

312
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:02,819
And Eliot.

313
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:06,884
Well, you know, I guess
we could do lake stuff another day.

314
00:22:06,954 --> 00:22:09,671
Here we go. Scones.

315
00:22:09,738 --> 00:22:13,961
Henry. Jake.
All right. Leave it there, the dog will get it.

316
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:51,014
Did you nail down an apartment?

317
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,155
I'm just waiting to hear.

318
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:56,903
I'll bet you could
get a place in Chicago for half the rent.

319
00:22:56,971 --> 00:22:59,458
Dad, I thought we made a deal.

320
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:02,528
That dock needs work.

321
00:23:13,611 --> 00:23:16,928
- Where are you going?
- The hardware store. I'll fix this place up.

322
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:19,687
- You got a crazy look. What are you getting?
- Tools!

323
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:47,239
Honey.

324
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:48,898
Honey.

325
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,453
OK. Do not stand up. Do you hear me?

326
00:23:52,524 --> 00:23:55,142
Dad! Dad! Hello?

327
00:23:56,395 --> 00:23:58,250
Dad!

328
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:03,556
Hey, kids. Tire swing ready!

329
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:09,254
Tire swing not ready.

330
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:49,218
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey. Get bored over at the Murtaughs'?

331
00:24:49,292 --> 00:24:51,528
No. We're going back after study time.

332
00:24:51,597 --> 00:24:54,913
You guys are making time for your studies?
I'm really proud of you.

333
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:56,777
Not us, Dad. Them.

334
00:24:56,844 --> 00:25:00,674
Mr Murtaugh forces all of the kids
to read and write two hours every day.

335
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,237
Lame. I know.

336
00:25:05,997 --> 00:25:07,851
Who are these guys?

337
00:25:08,812 --> 00:25:11,333
- What?
- There's no way I'm camping out.

338
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:15,398
Yes, honey.
You can do it one night for Daddy. Come on.

339
00:25:15,468 --> 00:25:18,403
- This doesn't sit well with me.
- I know what you mean.

340
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:22,700
Lorraine, are you serious?
Is she kidding?

341
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,792
That's not gonna fit in your tent, Lorraine.

342
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:29,282
I'm gonna make it fit, Dad.

343
00:25:34,957 --> 00:25:37,859
- Hey, come on. We're making s'mores.
- I'll help you.

344
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:41,032
Actually, we're trying
to eat only organic food.

345
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:44,778
- We're trying to eat only organic food.
- Is that for the baby?

346
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:47,845
Come on. Baby'll love a s'more.
Party in your tummy.

347
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:53,449
Cool. The Bakers are having a campout.
Can I go over?

348
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:57,892
Why have a campout when you can have
a full-on fondue party right here?

349
00:25:57,965 --> 00:25:59,623
Sweet.

350
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:02,660
Charlie, you're worse than a kitten.

351
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,545
Babe, that's your fourth s'more.

352
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:17,639
My parents never let me have these.
They're amazing.

353
00:26:23,502 --> 00:26:26,251
Do you think we should be
more strict with the kids?

354
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:32,133
No, honey. We give them love and guidance.
What else is there, really?

355
00:26:32,205 --> 00:26:35,369
Every time we turn around,
they're in trouble, about to get into it,

356
00:26:35,438 --> 00:26:37,827
or laying out a long-term plan to create it.

357
00:26:37,902 --> 00:26:41,895
Dad, how come those guys
know how to camp so good?

358
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:54,789
- Hey. Hey! What if we sing a camp song?
- OK. Sounds good.

359
00:27:08,654 --> 00:27:11,075
What do you say we give 'em
a run for their money?

360
00:27:33,806 --> 00:27:35,431
Come on. Stand up.

361
00:27:55,982 --> 00:27:58,764
This guy is so competitive!

362
00:28:13,966 --> 00:28:16,454
Boy, I love camping.

363
00:28:16,687 --> 00:28:18,662
Yeah. This is fun.

364
00:28:20,271 --> 00:28:23,981
- Good times. Good times.
- Good times, yeah.

365
00:28:24,047 --> 00:28:28,902
Hey, kids. Didn't you love
blowing Murtaugh off the lake last night?

366
00:28:29,134 --> 00:28:31,044
Kids?

367
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:33,224
Honey, they're all in the house.

368
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,237
- No.
- Yeah.

369
00:28:41,615 --> 00:28:43,076
Hello?

370
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:45,869
Happy?

371
00:28:45,935 --> 00:28:48,423
They can't spend one night in the tent?

372
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:50,218
Hey, Tom.

373
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:57,543
Now, what does that show-off want?

374
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,134
What a day. Hey, Tom?

375
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:03,436
Boy, you have got this place looking...

376
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:09,540
Anyway, I see the troops are sleeping in.

377
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:13,030
They're already up.
They're out cutting wood and making biscuits

378
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:16,452
and blazing a new trail out back -
nothing out of the ordinary.

379
00:29:16,527 --> 00:29:21,415
Yeah. Really impressive. Listen, the missus
and I are thinking of putting on a little spread.

380
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:23,592
Since the kids are getting along so well,

381
00:29:23,663 --> 00:29:26,795
why don't you and the gang
come to The Boulders for brunch?

382
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:29,646
- Actually, we have to...
- Cool, what time?

383
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:32,264
Mimosas at noon, on the dot.

384
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:34,757
Yeah!

385
00:29:39,471 --> 00:29:41,511
Attagirl.

386
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,972
Take it away, honey.

387
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:53,423
Adios, amigo.

388
00:29:54,512 --> 00:29:58,440
- Isn't he like the coolest dad ever?
- Yeah. Cool.

389
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,255
Whoa, dude!

390
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:14,151
Awesome, dude.

391
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,767
Kids, you stay right here.

392
00:30:24,464 --> 00:30:26,537
Welcome to The Boulders.

393
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:30,990
- Hey. Let's say hello.
- Hi.

394
00:30:31,056 --> 00:30:35,333
Hey. Thanks for having us.
Where's the gift shop?

395
00:30:35,408 --> 00:30:38,310
You brought your dog.

396
00:30:38,384 --> 00:30:41,679
- Sorry. Just say "sit."
- Down, Gunner.

397
00:30:43,536 --> 00:30:45,773
Tom. Baker!

398
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,787
Somebody help.

399
00:30:54,768 --> 00:30:57,932
- I'm fine.
- They're called obedience schools, Baker!

400
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,823
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

401
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:03,718
- Tie Fido up for five minutes.
- Honey, he's fine. Just let him play.

402
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:08,429
We don't want that animal near the dining set.
It was a gift from the king of Thailand.

403
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:11,344
Mark, there's a leash in the car. Get it.

404
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:13,580
- Why don't we all go inside?
- Good idea.

405
00:31:13,648 --> 00:31:15,339
I'll be right back.

406
00:31:15,408 --> 00:31:18,889
Sarah. You wanna go on the Seadoo
with me and Jake before we eat?

407
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,132
Yeah. Sure.

408
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:23,176
Cool. Let's go.

409
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:30,796
Are you coming or not, dude?

410
00:31:30,865 --> 00:31:32,523
Yeah.

411
00:31:33,617 --> 00:31:35,689
Jimmy. Almost forgot.

412
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:39,787
Tom, for heaven's sake.
You didn't have to do this.

413
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:42,758
- "Sparkling Cheesehead"?
- Wisconsin's finest bubbly.

414
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:49,162
I'm sure it is. Might have to let this baby
age about two, three hundred years, Tom.

415
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:54,733
Superstar, do me a favor. Take this to
the cellar and bring a bottle of Taittinger.

416
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:57,900
- Sure.
- I'll give you a hand.

417
00:31:57,969 --> 00:32:02,344
- It's a fantastic place.
- It's not much, but I call it a second home.

418
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:07,815
How come you guys
haven't built your own house up here?

419
00:32:07,889 --> 00:32:11,305
With 12 kids, you've gotta use the money
for food and water.

420
00:32:11,378 --> 00:32:15,818
I bet if Tom had kept thatjob at Illinois Poly
he could have built a place like this.

421
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:19,631
Well, life's full of choices.
Some good, some not so good.

422
00:32:19,697 --> 00:32:24,269
Honey, why don't you take Kate and show her
the dining set the king of Thailand gave us?

423
00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:28,265
- OK, honey.
- I'd love to look at the plates from a king.

424
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:32,593
- Don't get lost, honey.
- Tom, I wanna show you something.

425
00:32:32,658 --> 00:32:34,862
Feast your eyes on these honeys, Tom.

426
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:38,727
Albino ironwood,
right out of the Peruvian rainforest.

427
00:32:38,802 --> 00:32:42,828
You can still smell the jungle on 'em.
Go ahead, take a whiff.

428
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:47,633
Come on. Rest your honker
on the log and take a whiff.

429
00:32:47,698 --> 00:32:52,204
- Smells like global warming.
- That's moss. It's moss, Tom.

430
00:32:52,273 --> 00:32:55,088
Well, this is the trophy room.

431
00:32:57,202 --> 00:33:01,774
- Are those your kids?
- Yeah. That's the Murtaugh victory reel.

432
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:05,486
- It's on a loop.
- It's a good room.

433
00:33:05,554 --> 00:33:09,483
I'll tell you why
I love this room so much, Tom.

434
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:14,442
All the trophies, the ribbons,
the prizes - past, present and future.

435
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:16,881
It's proof that children can be groomed

436
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:20,262
to reflect the best aspects
of any given gene pool.

437
00:33:20,338 --> 00:33:25,259
- You just have to keep them on a short leash.
- I couldn't agree more.

438
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,785
My Anne's proof of that.

439
00:33:27,858 --> 00:33:30,989
You're looking a lot more put together
than you did a few years ago.

440
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:32,487
Thanks.

441
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:36,140
Remember your nose was too big,
and that skin irritation on your hand?

442
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:40,204
Ltjust kept working its way
up your arm and into your neck...

443
00:33:40,882 --> 00:33:44,679
I'm glad that it's gone, though. Looks good.

444
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:49,643
Well, if I remember correctly,
you weren't so hot yourself.

445
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:58,313
That mutt could use a shorter leash too.

446
00:34:03,251 --> 00:34:05,226
She's so cool.

447
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:10,737
Yeah, the kids and I spent a weekend
putting that dock together.

448
00:34:10,803 --> 00:34:14,731
Nothing like a little manual labor
to keep you humble. Sit down, Tom.

449
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:18,665
So Jimmy has matching pants to that shirt?

450
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:21,739
Boy, this place wasn't put together overnight.

451
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:24,528
- Does Daddy know about your tattoo?
- No.

452
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:28,942
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- I'm so sorry.

453
00:34:29,011 --> 00:34:30,735
It's OK. I'm fine.

454
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:36,456
- It's like spring break. Hope I win.
- I've got a shirt you can borrow.

455
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:38,702
- A shirt? OK.
- Mom, I...

456
00:34:39,987 --> 00:34:42,987
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

457
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:45,961
- If my dad finds out before I...
- You'll get grounded?

458
00:34:46,035 --> 00:34:48,686
Please, just don't say anything.

459
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:56,075
Nice hands.

460
00:35:06,835 --> 00:35:08,723
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey, Dad.

461
00:35:08,788 --> 00:35:11,341
You should see Mr Murtaugh's new Seadoo.

462
00:35:11,412 --> 00:35:16,911
That's terrific. Now turn around
and pretend to be looking at the view.

463
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:18,223
Why?

464
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:22,961
Turn around and pretend
to be looking at the view.

465
00:35:23,028 --> 00:35:26,737
Are you still in touch with your dark gifts?

466
00:35:26,804 --> 00:35:30,698
Punking, practical jokes,
soaking underwear and...

467
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:32,811
- Meat.
- Yeah.

468
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:34,956
- Classic.
- Yeah.

469
00:35:35,027 --> 00:35:39,981
- Yeah, I'm in touch. Why?
- I have a mission for you.

470
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:42,124
Who's the target?

471
00:35:42,324 --> 00:35:44,331
Murtaugh.

472
00:35:45,524 --> 00:35:48,459
I can help you. Hi.

473
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:52,458
- As long as I don't do time for the crime.
- Hey, guys. Hi.

474
00:35:52,532 --> 00:35:54,158
Done.

475
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:57,392
No grounding. No allowance dockage.

476
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,427
No spiel about the difference
between right and wrong.

477
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,696
And you have no problem
with the methods that I choose.

478
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:07,245
It's your contract, do with it what you will.

479
00:36:07,316 --> 00:36:10,251
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

480
00:36:10,324 --> 00:36:14,001
Hey, give Daddy a hug. Nail him.

481
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:17,582
Guys, guys. Guys! I have a mission for you.

482
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:21,002
- It's top-secret, and it's high-priority.
- Yeah? What is it?

483
00:36:21,076 --> 00:36:23,345
Come on. I'll show you.

484
00:36:38,709 --> 00:36:40,683
- Positions.
- Check.

485
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:55,661
My gosh. It's a purple bigfoot.

486
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:58,547
- What are you talking about?
- A purple bigfoot!

487
00:36:58,613 --> 00:37:00,817
- A what?
- I don't see anything.

488
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,274
Made you look, made you look.

489
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,618
- Made you look.
- You are so stupid.

490
00:37:05,685 --> 00:37:11,664
- Did I mention the dining set was a gift?
- The king of Thailand. Yeah, you did.

491
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:15,278
- Give me that roll.
- I see your kids can't wait to get started.

492
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:19,091
Well, that's just the way they are.

493
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:25,264
Hey, you guys.
No eating until everyone's seated.

494
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:31,249
- Eyes up here, honey.
- Doesn't she look hot?

495
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:43,180
Doesn't hold a candle to you, honey.
Come on, let's sit down.

496
00:37:43,253 --> 00:37:46,482
- Where have you been all my life?
- All right.

497
00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:49,331
- Tom, right over here.
- Thank you.

498
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:51,786
Ignore the place card.
Sit next to your wife.

499
00:37:51,861 --> 00:37:54,611
Fine. Fine, if you want chaos.
Right here, Tom.

500
00:37:54,677 --> 00:37:57,011
Believe me, I don't mind.

501
00:37:57,077 --> 00:37:59,980
Dad. Don't...

502
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:01,941
The seat cushion is soft.

503
00:38:02,005 --> 00:38:04,525
- So, you two play tennis?
- Yeah.

504
00:38:04,597 --> 00:38:06,866
- You're in the meat seat.
- What?

505
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:23,887
I knew that dog was gonna be trouble.

506
00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:32,018
Sit!

507
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,957
My china.

508
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:46,352
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

509
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:48,047
You don't know?

510
00:38:59,702 --> 00:39:02,222
It's OK. It happens all the time.

511
00:39:02,294 --> 00:39:06,450
It doesn't. I'm so sorry. I'm really
embarrassed. Thank you for the lovely shirt.

512
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,908
I insist that you send me a bill for this.

513
00:39:08,982 --> 00:39:12,779
Don't even think about it.
What's a few thousand dollars here or there?

514
00:39:12,854 --> 00:39:15,221
The main thing is you had a good time.

515
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:18,548
We'll talk about it later.
I'll see you on the tennis court.

516
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:20,524
Bring your A game.

517
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:24,015
- Bye.
- What was that?

518
00:39:24,086 --> 00:39:25,909
- Nothing.
- That was not nothing.

519
00:39:25,974 --> 00:39:29,716
This was not nothing. That was something.
All right. In the house.

520
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:32,304
I know. I'm a horrible father.

521
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:35,539
- Honey, you broke your promise.
- What promise?

522
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38,803
That you'd not get involved
in this competitive thing.

523
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,594
It's just all so infantile.

524
00:39:40,663 --> 00:39:43,478
- He tried to tell us how to raise the kids.
- Meaning?

525
00:39:43,543 --> 00:39:45,910
- He thinks the kids are...
- Did he say it?

526
00:39:45,975 --> 00:39:50,928
No, but you could tell that he implied
that's what he thought, that the kids were...

527
00:39:51,831 --> 00:39:52,943
That's right.

528
00:39:56,023 --> 00:40:00,845
"I do not like green eggs and ham.
I do not like them, Sam-l-am."

529
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:02,959
Aren't you a little old for that book?

530
00:40:03,031 --> 00:40:05,649
- She's reading to the baby.
- Reading to the baby?

531
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:09,810
Unborn babies, they're comforted
by the sound of their mother's voice.

532
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:14,287
- Just don't spoil my linebacker.
- The baby's gonna be what it wants to be.

533
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:18,036
Just let us be the parents, OK, Dad?
Come on, Bud. I'm hungry.

534
00:40:18,103 --> 00:40:19,565
Yeah. Me too.

535
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:26,609
- Hi, Mr Baker.
- Hi, Eliot. What's up?

536
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,686
- I was looking for Sarah.
- You mean Jake?

537
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,923
Sarah and I and Calvin,
we're going boarding this afternoon.

538
00:40:31,991 --> 00:40:34,096
Well, she'll be back soon.

539
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:38,608
- OK. I'll just wait on the dock.
- Wait, wait, wait.

540
00:40:38,711 --> 00:40:40,467
Sit down.

541
00:40:49,784 --> 00:40:52,533
What do you do for a living, Eliot?

542
00:40:53,943 --> 00:40:57,042
- I'm in eighth grade.
- Yeah. Right.

543
00:40:57,112 --> 00:41:00,974
- And how's that going for you?
- Fine.

544
00:41:01,048 --> 00:41:05,238
- Are you on any teams?
- Football, boarding and baseball.

545
00:41:05,304 --> 00:41:08,686
All that focus on sports -
that must impact your grades quite a bit.

546
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:12,883
No. Actually, you know,
I'm an honors student.

547
00:41:13,976 --> 00:41:17,292
- You play any instruments?
- Drums.

548
00:41:17,368 --> 00:41:21,329
You're probably
in one of those punk bands, right?

549
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:25,104
Timpani. You know, school orchestra.

550
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:29,453
- Hey, Eliot.
- See you, Mr Baker.

551
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,502
Later, dude... Dad.

552
00:41:40,023 --> 00:41:41,998
Guys.

553
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:47,021
- What now?
- Mind if I go waterboarding with you?

554
00:41:47,096 --> 00:41:49,965
It's kneeboarding,
and I'm pretty sure you can't do it.

555
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,429
If Jimmy can do it, I can.
You must be Calvin.

556
00:41:52,504 --> 00:41:55,984
- Nice to meet you. I just got back from Yale.
- Congratulations.

557
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:58,958
I'll just squeeze in over here. There we go.

558
00:41:59,032 --> 00:42:01,137
- Is everybody ready?
- Yeah.

559
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:05,332
- Fun?
- Yeah. Why don't you go first?

560
00:42:05,816 --> 00:42:08,850
Guys, keep an eye on him, all right?
You ready, Mr Baker?

561
00:42:08,921 --> 00:42:10,895
OK, I'm...

562
00:42:18,265 --> 00:42:22,705
- Sorry he interrogated you.
- My dad would have done the same thing.

563
00:42:29,017 --> 00:42:32,530
- Really?
- You should come to my house sometime.

564
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:46,544
He's really easy and likes to keep low-key.

565
00:42:46,616 --> 00:42:50,446
- Do you have a favorite subject?
- Probably math.

566
00:43:00,697 --> 00:43:02,704
Stop!

567
00:43:05,305 --> 00:43:08,502
You'll do better next time, Mr Baker. It's OK.

568
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:12,530
- Are you sure he'll be OK?
- Yeah, he'll be fine.

569
00:43:16,377 --> 00:43:18,351
Dad! Are you OK?

570
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:21,750
It's all good.

571
00:43:26,585 --> 00:43:29,880
Well... I'll go put on a little perfume.

572
00:43:32,663 --> 00:43:35,925
Sarah, Eliot seems OK.

573
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:39,798
- I see why you like him.
- Somebody's turning red.

574
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:41,325
Shut up!

575
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:44,822
Thanks a lot, Dad.

576
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:47,953
- What did I say?
- Men can be so clueless.

577
00:43:48,023 --> 00:43:50,412
Honey, men are clueless.

578
00:43:53,015 --> 00:43:56,015
- I'll go talk to her.
- Mom, let me do this, OK?

579
00:43:56,087 --> 00:44:00,310
Trust me, I've got experience
in the area of parental harassment.

580
00:44:08,664 --> 00:44:11,381
Hey, I totally know how you feel.

581
00:44:11,447 --> 00:44:13,422
How are you?

582
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:19,703
Dad can be pretty hands-on,
in-your-face sometimes.

583
00:44:19,768 --> 00:44:21,907
Just leave me alone.

584
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,248
A, I'm never trying to help her again.

585
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,615
And B, I cannot wait to move to New York.

586
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:23,023
- What are you doing here?
- This is where I run. What are you doing?

587
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:27,853
- I like to get out of the house.
- Take a break from the perfect daughter bit?

588
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:31,922
Hey, I'm not the only one who's
putting on an act for Daddy around here.

589
00:45:31,992 --> 00:45:34,545
You've hated the city since we were kids.

590
00:45:34,616 --> 00:45:37,845
- Why go to school there?
- Seemed like the right thing to do.

591
00:45:37,913 --> 00:45:42,550
Did it seem like the right thing to do because
your parents said it was the right thing to do?

592
00:45:42,617 --> 00:45:45,399
No. My parents wanted me
closer to home, that's why.

593
00:45:45,465 --> 00:45:48,247
Are you gonna live at home forever?

594
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:51,957
I just gotta figure out my next move and do it.

595
00:45:52,025 --> 00:45:56,051
How about you, superstar?
What's the master plan?

596
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:59,318
Somehow I gotta tell my dad
I'm not built for corporate life.

597
00:45:59,385 --> 00:46:03,476
- Good luck.
- So for now, I'm just gonna draw.

598
00:46:03,545 --> 00:46:06,360
- What do you draw?
- Stay still, Baker.

599
00:46:06,425 --> 00:46:10,964
Whoa. Yeah, right. You're not drawing me,
'cause I'm gonna... Right here? Is this good?

600
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:13,968
- If I stay here? It might be better...
- Stop smiling.

601
00:46:23,225 --> 00:46:27,022
- Sarah, come on. Hurry up!
- OK. OK.

602
00:46:27,098 --> 00:46:30,097
- Has anybody seen my other tennis shoe?
- No.

603
00:46:30,169 --> 00:46:32,079
No, I haven't.

604
00:46:32,154 --> 00:46:36,115
- Have you seen my other tennis shoe?
- No. Chiseler!

605
00:46:36,186 --> 00:46:38,357
You chiseling little...

606
00:46:43,866 --> 00:46:44,814
Great.

607
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:51,544
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Hey, guys.

608
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,399
- Good to see you.
- Hi.

609
00:46:53,466 --> 00:46:56,335
Nice shoes. Kidding. Let's warm up.

610
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,385
OK, let's do it.

611
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,185
- Come on, Murtaugh!
- Got it.

612
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,225
I don't remember you out here
when we were kids.

613
00:47:06,298 --> 00:47:10,454
Dad didn't allow us
to come out into the woods. OK, I'm done.

614
00:47:12,506 --> 00:47:16,761
That's Charlie Baker
figuring out his next move.

615
00:47:16,826 --> 00:47:20,569
- You're good.
- Tell my dad.

616
00:47:20,634 --> 00:47:23,601
Maybe he'll let me transfer
to Madison Art School.

617
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:29,075
- You wanna live up here and go to school?
- This lake is my favorite place on the planet.

618
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:32,856
- Why?
- I've always fantasized about moving here.

619
00:47:32,922 --> 00:47:35,508
I don't know,
maybe open up a garage or something.

620
00:47:35,578 --> 00:47:40,499
- Looks like you figured out your next move.
- I think you're right.

621
00:47:42,106 --> 00:47:44,113
Wanna go for a walk or something?

622
00:47:44,186 --> 00:47:49,816
- Is Charlie Baker asking me out on a date?
- I'm not sure our fathers would approve.

623
00:47:49,882 --> 00:47:51,857
Let's go.

624
00:47:55,194 --> 00:47:57,911
Yours. Nice. Nice!
This is mine.

625
00:48:00,538 --> 00:48:02,513
- It's these shoes.
- OK. All right.

626
00:48:02,587 --> 00:48:04,823
A poor workman blames his tools, Tom.

627
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:08,785
- Just serve it.
- This is payback for the china.

628
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:13,136
Come on. Give me your best, Jimmy,
give me your best.

629
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:15,545
- I got it.
- I got it.

630
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:18,872
- I got it, I got it, I got it.
- I got it.

631
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:20,083
Mine.

632
00:48:20,154 --> 00:48:21,943
- Got it.
- I got it.

633
00:48:30,427 --> 00:48:31,856
- Mine.
- Whoa.

634
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,611
- It's turbo.
- I'm in so much trouble. There's no way.

635
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:41,105
- Don't be a wimp.
- I'm not a wimp.

636
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:43,480
- Come on. Get in.
- OK, just one little cruise.

637
00:48:43,547 --> 00:48:45,968
Come on, Baker. I'm getting old here.

638
00:48:46,043 --> 00:48:48,214
Just be careful.

639
00:48:49,307 --> 00:48:50,103
Whoa! Slow down!

640
00:49:08,475 --> 00:49:13,560
Mr and Mrs Baker, excuse me. There's
a call from security over at the gift shop.

641
00:49:13,627 --> 00:49:16,311
- What's this about?
- Just follow me.

642
00:49:16,379 --> 00:49:18,354
Slow down! Stop!

643
00:49:20,379 --> 00:49:22,354
Slow down!

644
00:49:28,475 --> 00:49:32,698
We're willing to let it slide if you
promise to keep your kids under control.

645
00:49:32,763 --> 00:49:35,578
I really appreciate that.
We'll take care of it.

646
00:49:35,643 --> 00:49:39,669
- There you go. Thanks, Skippy.
- Thank you, Mr Murtaugh.

647
00:49:39,739 --> 00:49:41,562
Are you just gonna talk to her?

648
00:49:41,628 --> 00:49:44,977
How I discipline my kids
is none of your business.

649
00:49:45,052 --> 00:49:49,078
You know, I've been trying to say this
in a nice way, but...

650
00:49:49,148 --> 00:49:52,923
Well, there's a reason
your kids are screw-ups.

651
00:49:52,988 --> 00:49:56,250
My kids screwed up. They are not screw-ups.

652
00:49:56,316 --> 00:50:00,724
You're not strict enough.
Parenting isn't a popularity contest, Tom,

653
00:50:00,795 --> 00:50:04,374
but I guess if you knew that,
your kids wouldn't be so undisciplined.

654
00:50:04,444 --> 00:50:07,673
The only problem with my kids
is they're hanging out with yours.

655
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,228
It wasn't my daughter
who got caught stealing.

656
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,340
It wasn't my son who trashed a tennis court.

657
00:50:12,411 --> 00:50:15,892
Do you actually think
I'm screwing up my kids, Baker?

658
00:50:15,964 --> 00:50:18,419
Yeah. And one day they're gonna crack.

659
00:50:18,492 --> 00:50:21,492
Well, why don't we test that theory?
On Labor Day.

660
00:50:21,564 --> 00:50:25,339
Murtaughs versus Bakers. For the cup.

661
00:50:25,404 --> 00:50:27,705
You're on.

662
00:50:27,772 --> 00:50:29,943
We'll see you there.

663
00:50:32,092 --> 00:50:33,270
Let's go.

664
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,242
Did you just agree
to that competition thing and the cup?

665
00:50:36,316 --> 00:50:38,291
Yeah.

666
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:42,994
OK, missy, let's go walk and talk.

667
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:48,529
Now, tell me what this is all about,
because it's so not you.

668
00:50:49,404 --> 00:50:52,884
- I was embarrassed.
- Look at me, honey.

669
00:50:52,956 --> 00:50:55,095
Embarrassed about what?

670
00:50:56,124 --> 00:50:58,295
Make-up.

671
00:50:58,492 --> 00:51:04,089
Honey, you know you can come to me
any time with anything. You know that, right?

672
00:51:06,269 --> 00:51:11,354
And I know why you wanted the make-up.
It was for Eliot, right?

673
00:51:12,092 --> 00:51:13,653
Yeah.

674
00:51:13,725 --> 00:51:17,270
I'm just not pretty like Nora or Lorraine.

675
00:51:18,812 --> 00:51:22,587
I thought maybe the make-up would help.

676
00:51:22,652 --> 00:51:25,205
You're beautiful.

677
00:51:25,276 --> 00:51:28,659
I want you to remember
something else that's really important.

678
00:51:28,733 --> 00:51:32,889
When you like a boy,
never be anybody but yourself.

679
00:51:33,725 --> 00:51:37,172
Eliot liked you without make-up, didn't he?

680
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:41,329
- Do you think he really likes me?
- How could he not?

681
00:51:43,741 --> 00:51:46,491
- No more felonies. Deal?
- Deal.

682
00:51:46,557 --> 00:51:48,313
Good.

683
00:51:49,597 --> 00:51:53,591
- The Labor Day Cup's gonna be a bloodbath.
- You got that right.

684
00:51:53,853 --> 00:51:59,156
From now on, no seeing the Murtaughs,
no talking to them, no thinking about them.

685
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:02,196
- Can't we compete and still see them?
- No.

686
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:04,952
Right now, I am not a father. I am a coach.

687
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:09,910
And we're gonna be training twice a day,
every day, starting outside in ten minutes.

688
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:16,088
Jumping jacks, jumping jacks. Good.

689
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:22,108
Lorraine, come on. Push-ups. One, two.
Now back up to jumping jacks.

690
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:25,239
- Lorraine, come on.
- OK.

691
00:52:27,933 --> 00:52:30,355
And toss.

692
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:31,859
Toss.

693
00:52:31,933 --> 00:52:34,967
- Toss. Toss.
- Dad!

694
00:52:35,038 --> 00:52:36,761
- Just toss.
- Dad, lay off.

695
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:38,869
- Toss!
- I'm tossing.

696
00:52:38,941 --> 00:52:41,046
No crying.

697
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:44,532
- Step back.
- That's it. I can't handle the pressure, Dad!

698
00:52:44,605 --> 00:52:45,783
Eggs cost money.

699
00:52:48,638 --> 00:52:54,389
OK, it's a three-legged race, but run
as if you had two! On your mark, get set, go.

700
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,055
Go. Let's go.

701
00:52:57,214 --> 00:52:58,708
- Your fault!
- Hey!

702
00:52:58,782 --> 00:53:01,019
Come on, come on, get in. Come on.

703
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:07,027
- Murtaugh! Murtaugh! Murtaugh! Murtaugh!
- Dad! We're not Murtaughs!

704
00:53:17,598 --> 00:53:19,965
Take a deep swing. Boom, just like that.

705
00:53:36,414 --> 00:53:38,869
Give it a good one. Come on.

706
00:53:38,942 --> 00:53:40,186
One more.

707
00:53:45,086 --> 00:53:46,613
That's a zero.

708
00:54:01,247 --> 00:54:05,851
I really love having a family dinner where
all you can hear is forks hitting the plates.

709
00:54:05,919 --> 00:54:10,425
You know, this could be our last chance
together and you're totally ruining it.

710
00:54:10,494 --> 00:54:16,789
I'm glad we're moving to Houston. And so is
Iron Mike or Donna Baker Butkus McNulty.

711
00:54:27,903 --> 00:54:29,397
Bulk up.

712
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:38,614
You're burning a hole in my face.

713
00:54:38,687 --> 00:54:40,662
Tom.

714
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:44,150
You've gotta stop
this whole training camp thing.

715
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:50,169
This is not some little fence-line squabble.
This is an epic battle between two families.

716
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:54,549
No. No, no, honey.
I think this is Tom versus Jimmy.

717
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:59,000
I'm sorry, General, but you're losing
the respect of your troops.

718
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,460
That's dangerous. Give the kids some space.

719
00:55:01,535 --> 00:55:03,739
Are you asking me to back out?

720
00:55:03,807 --> 00:55:08,509
No, honey. It's just... Especially with Sarah.
This is her first crush. Come on.

721
00:55:08,575 --> 00:55:11,477
- What, with Eliot?
- Yes.

722
00:55:12,191 --> 00:55:15,639
She needs to know that we trust her.

723
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:18,810
She couldn't come to me
and tell me she wanted to wear make-up.

724
00:55:18,879 --> 00:55:23,833
Is that the kind of relationship
you want her to have with us?

725
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,167
- Hey. How are you?
- Hi.

726
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,817
Let's run.

727
00:55:37,888 --> 00:55:39,993
Just leave it. They'll get somebody.

728
00:55:40,064 --> 00:55:42,431
The kids drop stuff all the time
and leave me.

729
00:55:42,496 --> 00:55:44,601
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

730
00:55:44,672 --> 00:55:48,567
- How do you manage 12 kids?
- With great difficulty. Trust me.

731
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,022
Good, 'cause I have no idea what I'm doing.

732
00:55:52,992 --> 00:55:56,156
You've got a lot of fruit.
I'd get some of this refined sugar.

733
00:55:56,224 --> 00:56:00,119
It's great for
negotiating purposes or whatever.

734
00:56:00,192 --> 00:56:02,842
Jimmy's gone overboard
with this tough love thing.

735
00:56:02,912 --> 00:56:05,760
The kids are miserable
and he doesn't even see it.

736
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:07,929
He and Tom bring out the best in each other.

737
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:11,480
I'm actually getting a kick out of it.
Very entertaining.

738
00:56:11,553 --> 00:56:13,822
- And exhausting.
- This is good.

739
00:56:14,081 --> 00:56:16,317
If tonight's good, I'll ask my dad.

740
00:56:18,176 --> 00:56:22,748
So hopefully tonight will work.
OK. See you.

741
00:56:27,169 --> 00:56:29,143
Not my little girl.

742
00:56:37,313 --> 00:56:38,938
Hey, Dad.

743
00:56:39,552 --> 00:56:41,308
Are you OK?

744
00:56:41,376 --> 00:56:47,257
Yeah. I just need you to help me
pace out 25 yards for the egg race,

745
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:50,012
starting here, OK? There you go.

746
00:56:50,081 --> 00:56:52,088
- Yeah.
- OK, go ahead.

747
00:56:54,625 --> 00:56:58,487
- Hey, Dad, I was...
- Those steps are too small.

748
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:08,125
- Those steps...
- Can I go to the movies with Eliot tonight?

749
00:57:10,113 --> 00:57:11,869
...are too big.

750
00:57:18,113 --> 00:57:20,480
I guess so.

751
00:57:27,265 --> 00:57:28,280
Sarah!

752
00:57:28,353 --> 00:57:33,755
Sarah! Nora has to urinate, and a full bladder
puts inordinate strain on the embryotic sac...

753
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,727
Kim! Thank you.
We could just go with "hurry up."

754
00:57:36,801 --> 00:57:39,070
Hurry up!

755
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,944
I need Lorraine.

756
00:57:45,282 --> 00:57:48,129
You get Lorraine, I'll pee outside.

757
00:57:50,593 --> 00:57:52,665
Hey. It's me.

758
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:56,892
How's it going?

759
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:04,505
Eliot asked me out, and I'm kind of new
to the dating thing, so...

760
00:58:08,225 --> 00:58:12,535
- Are you gonna make me beg?
- I was thinking about it.

761
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,048
Come on.

762
00:58:17,985 --> 00:58:20,953
Let's start with your make-up.

763
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,465
Lorraine...

764
00:58:26,721 --> 00:58:29,405
- Thanks.
- Don't worry about it.

765
00:58:31,521 --> 00:58:32,863
- Pink?
- Come on.

766
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:35,745
Can't we do, like, a skin color?

767
00:58:36,386 --> 00:58:39,037
There you go. It looks good.

768
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:47,225
Hey, guys.

769
00:58:47,298 --> 00:58:49,338
Guys. I need everybody's attention.

770
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:53,152
Sarah's about to come downstairs,
and she's going on her date tonight.

771
00:58:53,218 --> 00:58:56,993
She looks a little different,
so I would really appreciate it

772
00:58:57,058 --> 00:59:01,019
if you guys could give her
the respect that you never gave me,

773
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:07,200
and not ridicule her style choices before she
enters the world of multi-gender interaction.

774
00:59:07,266 --> 00:59:10,234
So go about your little chores
and act completely natural.

775
00:59:10,306 --> 00:59:11,867
Lorraine.

776
00:59:12,834 --> 00:59:16,664
I think you're going
to do just fine in New York.

777
00:59:16,738 --> 00:59:18,810
Thank you.

778
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:32,314
Hubba-hubba.

779
00:59:45,027 --> 00:59:47,580
You look very pretty, honey. You always do.

780
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:49,626
Thank you.

781
00:59:49,699 --> 00:59:51,968
Well, I'm going to the movies.

782
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:54,456
Well, sounds good. Need some money?

783
00:59:54,531 --> 00:59:57,248
No. I have some from lawn mowing.

784
00:59:58,659 --> 01:00:02,434
- Limo's here.
- There's Mr Murtaugh.

785
01:00:02,499 --> 01:00:07,288
Well, have fun, and I'll pick you up
outside the theater at nine.

786
01:00:07,363 --> 01:00:09,251
Bye.

787
01:00:11,843 --> 01:00:13,785
- Bye.
- Bye, cutie.

788
01:00:15,075 --> 01:00:18,370
I'll save a spot for you on the varsity.

789
01:00:20,227 --> 01:00:22,682
Have fun.

790
01:00:24,099 --> 01:00:26,335
- Cute, isn't she?
- Yeah.

791
01:00:27,427 --> 01:00:30,776
Seems like yesterday that was you, missy.

792
01:00:33,507 --> 01:00:38,810
- You're not gonna start crying, are you, Dad?
- I'm a football coach, remember?

793
01:00:38,883 --> 01:00:42,080
- I like Henrietta.
- You are not calling it Henrietta.

794
01:00:42,147 --> 01:00:44,995
All right. What have we got to eat?

795
01:00:52,355 --> 01:00:54,624
Can I go to the movies with Eliot?

796
01:00:54,787 --> 01:00:58,682
Can I go to the movies with Eliot?

797
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:04,224
Honey, do you want something to eat?

798
01:01:06,052 --> 01:01:08,026
Tom, do you want something to eat?

799
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:11,165
No. You know what?
Actually, I should go get Sarah.

800
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:13,570
It's 7:30. The movie just started.

801
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:17,433
I'm not going directly.
I'm just gonna stop and get gas first.

802
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,769
There's bound to be traffic,
'cause it's Labor Day weekend.

803
01:01:20,835 --> 01:01:22,810
- Sure there is.
- I'll get going.

804
01:01:22,884 --> 01:01:27,706
And I don't trust those fish clocks.
They're notoriously slow.

805
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,503
I love you, sweetheart.

806
01:01:29,572 --> 01:01:31,066
Thank you.

807
01:01:31,139 --> 01:01:32,994
One, please.

808
01:01:48,196 --> 01:01:50,585
What are you doing here?

809
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:54,883
If you must know, I'm here to make sure
this movie is appropriate for our children.

810
01:01:54,948 --> 01:01:57,501
It's rated G.

811
01:01:59,108 --> 01:02:01,792
Sir, could you please sit down?

812
01:02:03,556 --> 01:02:07,746
- What are you doing here so early?
- Father of the daughter always arrives early.

813
01:02:07,813 --> 01:02:11,490
- Everybody knows that.
- Excuse me. Is there a problem here?

814
01:02:11,557 --> 01:02:14,524
- He's harassing me.
- He's guilty of overparenting.

815
01:02:14,596 --> 01:02:19,866
If you two can't keep it down,
I'm going to throw both of you out.

816
01:02:28,261 --> 01:02:30,366
My God. Look at this.

817
01:02:31,236 --> 01:02:33,538
What? He's stretching.

818
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:40,223
- He's doing "the move."
- What move?

819
01:02:42,117 --> 01:02:46,045
You're sitting in the theater, you fake a yawn...

820
01:02:46,117 --> 01:02:48,768
Oh, boy, am I tired.

821
01:02:50,149 --> 01:02:52,418
Hand comes over.

822
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:56,544
Then a little while later, head comes over,
giving you extra reach here.

823
01:02:56,613 --> 01:02:59,068
Mom, look at those two down there.

824
01:02:59,141 --> 01:03:01,824
See what I mean?

825
01:03:01,893 --> 01:03:03,649
Sweet Jesus.

826
01:03:06,085 --> 01:03:10,275
- Warning number two.
- He was showing me "the move."

827
01:03:13,445 --> 01:03:15,333
Do you mind?

828
01:03:18,789 --> 01:03:22,084
- You don't know "the move"?
- No. I don't know "the move," OK?

829
01:03:22,149 --> 01:03:26,305
And I wasn't a hormone-crazed Romeo
when I was a kid. I had self-control.

830
01:03:26,373 --> 01:03:29,821
- I had social sophistication, like my son.
- Be quiet down there!

831
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:34,432
- Your son has hormones like every teenager.
- Meaning what?

832
01:03:34,501 --> 01:03:38,331
Meaning on the sophistication scale,
he's one step above ape.

833
01:03:38,406 --> 01:03:42,366
- Are you calling my son an ape?
- He's an ape like every other male teenager.

834
01:03:42,437 --> 01:03:45,285
- Take it back.
- I'm not gonna take it back.

835
01:03:45,349 --> 01:03:47,237
Take it...

836
01:03:47,302 --> 01:03:48,611
Take it back.

837
01:03:48,677 --> 01:03:52,736
- Were you gonna poke me?
- No, I was not gonna poke you.

838
01:03:52,806 --> 01:03:55,970
- You were gonna poke me.
- Because you were asking for it.

839
01:03:56,038 --> 01:03:58,885
If I'm asking for it,
why don't you give it to me?

840
01:03:58,949 --> 01:04:03,205
- You want a poke?
- What's going on down there?

841
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:05,474
- Call that a poke?
- I call that a practice.

842
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:08,771
- Give me your best poke. I want your best.
- You're asking for it.

843
01:04:08,837 --> 01:04:10,747
I do. Yeah.

844
01:04:13,702 --> 01:04:16,604
Hey! Call somebody. Somebody help.

845
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:28,482
- Hey, honey, how did it go?
- Dad was totally spying on me.

846
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,372
You ruined everything.

847
01:04:30,438 --> 01:04:35,489
There's no way that I'm competing for you
in that stupid cup tomorrow.

848
01:04:37,446 --> 01:04:41,308
- I can't believe you did that.
- Really, Dad, that is so Big Brother.

849
01:04:41,382 --> 01:04:45,954
- Yeah, let's go.
- Come on, Bud, let's put this baby to bed.

850
01:04:46,022 --> 01:04:48,389
Not cool, Dad.

851
01:04:48,454 --> 01:04:54,597
You and Jimmy aren't so different, Dad.
Different styles, yeah, but same result.

852
01:04:54,662 --> 01:04:57,150
Let's go, guys.

853
01:04:57,895 --> 01:04:59,837
Honey.

854
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:01,983
Honey, we talked about this, didn't we?

855
01:05:02,054 --> 01:05:06,429
The tighter you hang on,
the more they're gonna pull away. Right?

856
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:08,477
I'll go talk to her.

857
01:05:17,479 --> 01:05:20,795
Well, we're gonna go compete for the cup.

858
01:05:21,671 --> 01:05:25,533
Couldn't get any more volunteers?

859
01:05:25,607 --> 01:05:28,094
You gonna come
and watch us kick some hiney?

860
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:32,705
Well, maybe I will, honey,
when I get everybody fed.

861
01:05:32,774 --> 01:05:34,749
I'm sorry.

862
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:43,936
- OK, guys. Come on, let's go.
- Come on, Dad.

863
01:05:44,007 --> 01:05:45,916
And I'm sorry too.

864
01:05:52,103 --> 01:05:56,805
- Did Dad go?
- Yep. With Kyle and Nigel.

865
01:06:11,239 --> 01:06:13,890
Hey. The Chiseler's got my wallet.

866
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:23,686
- Check it out.
- Must have an escape hatch.

867
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:29,152
- Look at all this stuff.
- That's mine from, like, the '80s.

868
01:06:31,303 --> 01:06:33,343
Careful. Careful.

869
01:06:34,952 --> 01:06:37,123
Let me see that.

870
01:06:38,919 --> 01:06:41,091
Look at this.

871
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,581
It's our old team flag.

872
01:06:43,655 --> 01:06:45,728
We lost to the Murtaughs by two points.

873
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,221
Yeah, 'cause Mom fell in the sack race.

874
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:51,143
Daddy carried me all the way home.
Fond memories.

875
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:54,917
You know your father. He wants to be
a part of every single one of them.

876
01:06:54,983 --> 01:06:57,733
That's why he's having
such a hard time letting go.

877
01:06:57,799 --> 01:07:03,069
But one thing - no matter what Daddy says,
if he's in a good mood or a bad mood,

878
01:07:03,176 --> 01:07:05,925
you're his favorite team, right?

879
01:07:14,024 --> 01:07:16,991
And left. And right.

880
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:20,291
And left. And right.

881
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:22,247
And left...

882
01:07:22,312 --> 01:07:24,319
Bakers.

883
01:07:26,696 --> 01:07:29,347
What gives, Tom? Couldn't rally your team?

884
01:07:29,416 --> 01:07:33,159
It's all I've got,
but it's enough to take you down, Murtaugh.

885
01:07:33,224 --> 01:07:37,763
Are you kidding me?
You'll be lucky to beat the Doobners.

886
01:07:40,424 --> 01:07:43,424
- We'll see. Come on, guys.
- We'll see.

887
01:07:43,496 --> 01:07:48,930
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 46th
annual Lake Winnetka Labor Day Cup.

888
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:54,397
Now, we have seven families
competing in ten events today.

889
01:07:54,472 --> 01:07:57,920
The family winning the most events
will win the cup. Simple enough.

890
01:07:58,152 --> 01:08:02,528
So let's get to it, all right?
Contestants, here we go.

891
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:08,484
OK, guys. Let's do this.

892
01:08:15,593 --> 01:08:17,894
Hey, Dad. We're here.

893
01:08:24,937 --> 01:08:26,944
Dad!

894
01:08:29,993 --> 01:08:32,960
There's the team. There's the team.

895
01:08:34,121 --> 01:08:36,226
You can't keep the varsity down.

896
01:08:36,297 --> 01:08:41,512
And I promise never to go on a date
with you and Eliot again.

897
01:08:43,113 --> 01:08:45,502
Hey, Murtaugh!

898
01:08:45,577 --> 01:08:48,162
This is our year!

899
01:08:48,233 --> 01:08:50,088
Let's see what you got, Tom.

900
01:08:52,585 --> 01:08:55,487
- OK, Murtaughs.
- Huddling.

901
01:08:55,561 --> 01:08:58,278
I've been ajerk all week,
but that's old news.

902
01:08:58,345 --> 01:09:01,891
- Get loose. Don't let 'em intimidate you.
- Yeah!

903
01:09:01,961 --> 01:09:04,678
You each have a special talent.
I want you to use it.

904
01:09:04,745 --> 01:09:07,331
I don't care if we win or lose.
Just do your best.

905
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:11,973
OK. Hey, what are you doing?
Stop with the nicey-nice.

906
01:09:14,185 --> 01:09:19,520
Here's the game plan. We'll step on their
throats and press until they stop breathing.

907
01:09:19,593 --> 01:09:22,822
- Yeah!
- Get focused and stay with the game plan.

908
01:09:22,889 --> 01:09:26,370
- What would that be?
- We don't have a game plan, but...

909
01:09:26,442 --> 01:09:29,758
- Chin up. Charge the mountain!
- Exactly! That's the game plan.

910
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:31,043
OK, break on three.

911
01:09:31,305 --> 01:09:33,793
One, two, three.

912
01:09:36,361 --> 01:09:38,271
Come on, come on, come on.

913
01:09:38,346 --> 01:09:40,036
Come on, go. Come on, go. Go, go!

914
01:09:40,105 --> 01:09:41,731
Yes! Yes!

915
01:09:42,602 --> 01:09:44,991
Yeah, Mark! Come on.

916
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:47,231
Go! Go!

917
01:09:47,306 --> 01:09:49,728
Charge it, charge it, charge it!

918
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,640
Good job.

919
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:04,232
OK. That's OK.

920
01:10:08,682 --> 01:10:11,682
- Bull's-eye!
- One for the Bakers!

921
01:10:22,826 --> 01:10:25,095
Come on, Charlie.

922
01:10:25,162 --> 01:10:27,234
- That's it. That's it.
- Go! Go!

923
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:33,920
Go, superstar.

924
01:10:33,995 --> 01:10:35,718
Yeah!

925
01:10:36,714 --> 01:10:40,544
- Gotta be tough, Baker. Gotta be tough.
- What is this?

926
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,104
Out.

927
01:11:05,963 --> 01:11:08,199
- Here we go, Tom.
- I'm OK, Murtaugh.

928
01:11:08,843 --> 01:11:10,850
Look out.

929
01:11:11,691 --> 01:11:14,408
Not your sport?

930
01:11:14,474 --> 01:11:16,776
Go for ajog.

931
01:11:16,843 --> 01:11:18,436
Come on. Keep up.

932
01:11:20,138 --> 01:11:22,277
Reverse.

933
01:11:22,347 --> 01:11:25,413
Couldn't have asked for a better day.

934
01:11:28,587 --> 01:11:30,856
Look out!

935
01:11:34,091 --> 01:11:35,400
Ouch.

936
01:11:38,859 --> 01:11:44,839
Well, folks, for the first time since 1961,
our Labor Day Cup has ended in a tie.

937
01:11:48,011 --> 01:11:50,597
The Miller family
will be taking third place.

938
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:53,482
And to determine second place
and our champion,

939
01:11:53,547 --> 01:11:56,962
the Bakers and the Murtaughs
are going to have a canoe race

940
01:11:57,035 --> 01:12:00,330
from here to the State Forest
end of the park and back.

941
01:12:00,396 --> 01:12:02,883
And all family members must participate.

942
01:12:02,955 --> 01:12:06,752
Mike, I got a daughter who's due in a week.
She can't do that.

943
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:09,958
Tom, maybe you can
work something out with Jimmy here.

944
01:12:10,027 --> 01:12:13,508
Looks like you're gonna have to forfeit, Tom.

945
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,587
Well...

946
01:12:23,499 --> 01:12:26,150
She can't do it, so we're done.

947
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:28,456
And congratulations.

948
01:12:30,987 --> 01:12:32,962
I'm going, Dad.

949
01:12:34,348 --> 01:12:37,828
You just pissed off
a severely hormonal pregnant woman.

950
01:12:37,899 --> 01:12:39,426
Let's do this!

951
01:12:40,012 --> 01:12:41,987
Nora?

952
01:12:44,171 --> 01:12:46,855
- Are you sure?
- I need a life jacket.

953
01:12:46,924 --> 01:12:50,088
- Go, Bakers.
- Come on, Murtaughs.

954
01:12:50,156 --> 01:12:54,117
- Lose those shoes. They're fancy and new.
- What? Yours are the same.

955
01:12:54,188 --> 01:12:56,676
I'm a mom. I need the height.
Take those off.

956
01:12:56,747 --> 01:13:00,130
Mom. Mine tie my new outfit in together.

957
01:13:04,684 --> 01:13:07,367
Stay on the north side of the lake.
There's less wind.

958
01:13:07,436 --> 01:13:11,233
- Thanks, Murtaugh.
- You're welcome, Baker.

959
01:13:12,428 --> 01:13:15,014
Let's go, superstar.

960
01:13:15,084 --> 01:13:16,993
It's supposed to be fun.

961
01:13:33,165 --> 01:13:35,848
- You ready?
- Ready.

962
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:38,764
- On your marks.
- Murtaugh!

963
01:13:38,828 --> 01:13:40,683
- Get set.
- Murtaugh!

964
01:13:53,325 --> 01:13:56,773
Go, Bakers! Go, Bakers!

965
01:14:02,988 --> 01:14:05,028
Come on, we'll catch up. Let's go.

966
01:14:05,101 --> 01:14:08,581
We're gonna win this, Murtaughs!

967
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:11,402
Come on. Put some muscle in it, Bakers.

968
01:14:11,468 --> 01:14:13,443
Stroke.

969
01:14:15,661 --> 01:14:18,443
- Stroke.
- Stroke.

970
01:14:18,509 --> 01:14:21,356
Come on, superstar. Come on, Kenneth.

971
01:14:21,421 --> 01:14:24,203
- Not this time, Murtaugh.
- That's what you think.

972
01:14:24,269 --> 01:14:26,570
Stroke, stroke.

973
01:14:32,365 --> 01:14:34,853
I think we're taking on water.

974
01:14:34,925 --> 01:14:36,583
It's me.

975
01:14:36,653 --> 01:14:39,882
My God! My God!
Nora's waterjust broke.

976
01:14:41,869 --> 01:14:43,779
Jimmy!

977
01:14:43,853 --> 01:14:46,504
- Row! Row!
- Jimmy!

978
01:14:47,405 --> 01:14:51,234
- Something's wrong, Jimmy.
- He's trying to pull a fast one. Now, paddle.

979
01:14:51,309 --> 01:14:54,343
- I don't believe it.
- What if somebody's hurt?

980
01:14:54,414 --> 01:14:56,803
Honey, we have a substantial lead. It's a trick.

981
01:14:56,877 --> 01:15:02,245
- How can you be sure?
- I don't wanna lose. Now, paddle. Stroke.

982
01:15:03,213 --> 01:15:04,936
OK, everyone, calm down.

983
01:15:05,005 --> 01:15:07,907
- If we cut through, the road's not far.
- Can you get us there?

984
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:10,883
- Hello. Nature boy, remember?
- Let's go.

985
01:15:10,957 --> 01:15:12,681
- Sit tight.
- Go faster.

986
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:15,467
- No, Bud. Stay with Nora.
- Row.

987
01:15:17,069 --> 01:15:20,615
Annie, what are you doing?
What are you doing, superstar? Paddle.

988
01:15:20,686 --> 01:15:23,501
I'm not a superstar, Dad.

989
01:15:25,486 --> 01:15:28,421
I'm just a person
who's trying to have her own life.

990
01:15:28,494 --> 01:15:31,527
And this is not my idea of living. It's yours.

991
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:36,200
Like my tattoo?

992
01:15:39,662 --> 01:15:43,077
- Annie, get back in this boat.
- You'll have to win it without me too.

993
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:45,571
Eliot, don't you dare. Don't you...

994
01:15:45,646 --> 01:15:48,516
- I'm outta here.
- Kenneth!

995
01:15:49,102 --> 01:15:52,517
- Not cool, Dad.
- Becky, don't you...

996
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:55,885
- You've gotta lighten up.
- Daniel!

997
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:58,503
- We like the Bakers.
- Yeah, Dad.

998
01:15:58,574 --> 01:16:00,996
Lisa! Robin!

999
01:16:01,134 --> 01:16:06,185
OK, that's it. You know what? You kids
are gonna be cut off if you don't, you know...

1000
01:16:06,254 --> 01:16:09,288
No more charge accounts. Think about that.

1001
01:16:09,358 --> 01:16:12,140
- What is wrong with you?
- I want to win!

1002
01:16:12,206 --> 01:16:16,330
You don't get it, Sarina. It's not me.
It's him. It's Tom.

1003
01:16:16,398 --> 01:16:19,432
He was always the popular one.
He was the one everybody liked.

1004
01:16:19,503 --> 01:16:22,536
Everybody. All the girls.
All the parents liked him.

1005
01:16:22,606 --> 01:16:26,763
- My own father even liked him better.
- That was 18 years before I was born.

1006
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:30,758
Get over it. Look, your kids
are trying to tell you something.

1007
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:34,758
And unless you wanna start looking
for wife number four, you'd better listen.

1008
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:37,001
Now, paddle.

1009
01:16:38,734 --> 01:16:42,051
- Watch out.
- Are you sure you're OK?

1010
01:16:42,127 --> 01:16:45,061
- 50 cents says it's a girl.
- I'll take that bet.

1011
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:47,044
- I'm in.
- Mom, Mom, Mom!

1012
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:50,021
- I'm all right, I'm all right.
- I got you, I got you!

1013
01:16:50,094 --> 01:16:53,411
That's OK. I got my hips to balance me.
How are you feeling?

1014
01:16:53,487 --> 01:16:55,341
- Cramping a little.
- OK, how often?

1015
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:57,741
Just a couple of times so far.

1016
01:17:00,047 --> 01:17:03,789
- I think I'm going to be sick.
- Pay attention to her!

1017
01:17:03,855 --> 01:17:05,895
Is she OK?

1018
01:17:05,967 --> 01:17:09,644
Yeah. She's delivering lakeside, but yeah.
Did you swim all the way here?

1019
01:17:09,711 --> 01:17:14,119
- Baker, what's going on?
- Nora's having her baby. We need a hospital.

1020
01:17:14,191 --> 01:17:16,678
- What can I do to help?
- You can help with Nora.

1021
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:19,533
- Mark's on point. Right?
- I know the area really well.

1022
01:17:19,599 --> 01:17:23,560
Dad forced me to read topographical maps
of this area, for no apparent reason.

1023
01:17:23,631 --> 01:17:26,413
Hey, that's my boy.
Lead the way, Kenneth Murtaugh.

1024
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:29,894
My dad has let me have
almost every animal in the world,

1025
01:17:29,967 --> 01:17:31,854
which makes me an expert on scat trails.

1026
01:17:31,919 --> 01:17:35,115
- That's my boy.
- Point us the right way, I'll find a scat trail.

1027
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:37,158
- What's "scat"?
- Animal poop.

1028
01:17:37,231 --> 01:17:39,882
Cool, we're following poop.

1029
01:17:40,879 --> 01:17:43,814
OK, I'm a little competitive.

1030
01:17:43,887 --> 01:17:45,610
- I know.
- Go! Go!

1031
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:48,996
- Come on, guys. This way.
- There's a road up ahead.

1032
01:18:08,688 --> 01:18:10,663
Yeah. We did it!

1033
01:18:12,335 --> 01:18:14,342
Come on, guys, this way.

1034
01:18:17,999 --> 01:18:20,814
Come on. Hurry! Come on, hurry up!

1035
01:18:24,815 --> 01:18:27,270
I'll take it from here. I got it.

1036
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,760
My daughter is about to deliver
and I need to get her in.

1037
01:18:34,832 --> 01:18:38,890
I don't want her to feel any pain.
I want the baby to be healthy. Get it? Good.

1038
01:18:38,959 --> 01:18:42,985
- If I could get you to fill out...
- I wouldn't mess with her if I were you, OK?

1039
01:18:43,055 --> 01:18:44,648
Right.

1040
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,534
- Wow.
- She's having a baby.

1041
01:18:48,592 --> 01:18:51,658
Stay calm! Can we get a chair over here?!

1042
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:54,598
- Get me in a wheelchair.
- I need a wheelchair, stat!

1043
01:18:54,671 --> 01:18:56,330
Get the chair!

1044
01:18:57,168 --> 01:18:59,590
- My God. My God.
- Good luck.

1045
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:09,647
It must be this way.

1046
01:19:09,712 --> 01:19:12,844
That way. All right.
Family only in the delivery room.

1047
01:19:12,912 --> 01:19:16,774
- Whoa, whoa! You're all family?
- Yes.

1048
01:19:16,849 --> 01:19:18,856
- Help me out here.
- I'm her mother.

1049
01:19:18,928 --> 01:19:21,132
- Of course.
- Kate.

1050
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:24,967
Do your thing.

1051
01:19:27,409 --> 01:19:32,166
- OK, come on. Let's go.
- Tom, actually, we'd like Lorraine to come.

1052
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,629
We want you to be the godmother.

1053
01:19:34,704 --> 01:19:37,039
Really?

1054
01:19:37,201 --> 01:19:39,273
Whoa! Having a baby here!

1055
01:19:39,344 --> 01:19:43,981
- We'll try to get you a linebacker, Tom.
- Come on, everybody. Come on.

1056
01:19:44,048 --> 01:19:46,415
This is a hospital. You guys have to be quiet.

1057
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,368
Tom.

1058
01:19:48,432 --> 01:19:50,821
You mind if we wait with you?

1059
01:19:50,897 --> 01:19:52,555
That'd be great.

1060
01:20:03,633 --> 01:20:05,738
They're good kids, Jimmy. All of 'em.

1061
01:20:05,809 --> 01:20:08,297
And you're saying we have
nothing to do with it?

1062
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:09,994
They're born hard-wired.

1063
01:20:10,065 --> 01:20:11,853
- Look what we found.
- Check it out.

1064
01:20:11,953 --> 01:20:15,302
Hey. Just be sure and disinfect them.

1065
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:18,311
It's a bedpan, Kenny. Take it off.

1066
01:20:18,385 --> 01:20:21,997
- So your kid gets my kid to wear a bedpan...
- I didn't tell him to do it.

1067
01:20:22,289 --> 01:20:27,526
You look in the face of a six-month-old
and that's the way they are.

1068
01:20:30,129 --> 01:20:34,188
You look like
you have something to say.

1069
01:20:34,258 --> 01:20:39,789
I'm done with the city, Dad. I'm gonna open
up my own garage and I'm moving up here.

1070
01:20:39,857 --> 01:20:41,930
And I wanna audit art classes at Madison.

1071
01:20:42,001 --> 01:20:45,416
- Pardon me?
- Dad, I wanna be an artist.

1072
01:20:45,489 --> 01:20:48,686
I don't think that's gonna happen.

1073
01:20:49,329 --> 01:20:51,239
Jimmy.

1074
01:20:53,585 --> 01:20:57,001
Although it does sound pretty exciting.

1075
01:21:02,098 --> 01:21:07,215
- Sweetheart, is this what you really want?
- I'm sure.

1076
01:21:07,282 --> 01:21:11,657
You know, Annie,
I was just trying to be a good father.

1077
01:21:12,498 --> 01:21:13,807
I know.

1078
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:21,190
- What do you think?
- Sounds like you got your mind made up.

1079
01:21:21,265 --> 01:21:23,437
I do. You OK with that?

1080
01:21:25,426 --> 01:21:27,597
Yeah. I think I am.

1081
01:21:32,946 --> 01:21:34,920
Excuse me. Tom?

1082
01:21:37,169 --> 01:21:39,112
You wanna meet your grandson?

1083
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,857
Yeah.

1084
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:10,250
You did a good job, honey. Really good job.

1085
01:22:10,322 --> 01:22:14,577
That's a big boy. Too bad
he wasn't there to help us win the cup.

1086
01:22:14,642 --> 01:22:17,009
He'll get a chance.

1087
01:22:17,075 --> 01:22:19,442
Mike Romanow gave me a deal.

1088
01:22:20,338 --> 01:22:23,306
Now we own the big house at the lake.

1089
01:22:25,042 --> 01:22:28,206
It'll be nice having you
in the neighborhood, Bud.

1090
01:22:28,274 --> 01:22:33,228
You Murtaughs better start cranking out
grandkids if you wanna compete.

1091
01:22:33,299 --> 01:22:37,292
You guys. My godchild is trying to snooze.

1092
01:22:37,362 --> 01:22:40,396
So, any ideas on names?

1093
01:22:43,379 --> 01:22:46,608
I think we're going to go with "Tom."

1094
01:22:46,675 --> 01:22:50,701
'Cause you taught us
that there's no way to be a perfect parent,

1095
01:22:50,771 --> 01:22:54,251
but a million ways to be a really good one.

1096
01:22:56,242 --> 01:22:59,625
And you're about as good as they get.

1097
01:22:59,699 --> 01:23:01,706
Say hi to Grandpa.

1098
01:23:02,483 --> 01:23:04,174
Go on.

1099
01:23:13,843 --> 01:23:15,948
You're so beautiful.

1100
01:23:22,291 --> 01:23:24,713
Tom. Hey, Tom.

1101
01:23:31,187 --> 01:23:33,424
Welcome to family.

1102
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:07,631
Letting go is the hardest thing
you can do as a parent.

1103
01:24:07,699 --> 01:24:11,376
You have to settle with the past,
engage in the present,

1104
01:24:11,444 --> 01:24:13,647
and believe in the future.

1105
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:16,115
That vacation at Lake Winnetka
reminded Tom and me

1106
01:24:16,179 --> 01:24:22,409
that we're always learning as parents,
and that the bond is forever.

1107
01:24:22,484 --> 01:24:25,135
Even as the kids grow up
and venture out on their own,

1108
01:24:25,204 --> 01:24:28,946
we'll always be with them
and they'll always be with us.

1109
01:24:29,011 --> 01:24:32,492
Because life is a voyage
that's homeward bound.

1110
01:25:35,445 --> 01:25:37,965
Is this my normal face?

1111
01:25:39,893 --> 01:25:42,479
Hi, Poo-poo. You want a treat?

1112
01:25:48,981 --> 01:25:50,639
Can I redo that?

1113
01:25:55,381 --> 01:25:57,355
What are we gonna do?

1114
01:25:58,421 --> 01:26:02,611
She'll never walk again, I'll tell you that.

1115
01:26:04,040 --> 01:27:55,792
THE END
