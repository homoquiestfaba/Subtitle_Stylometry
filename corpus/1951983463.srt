1
00:00:05,303 --> 00:00:07,568
Rome, 44 B.C.

2
00:00:07,603 --> 00:00:10,003
There are whispers of civil war.

3
00:00:10,203 --> 00:00:14,703
The military conquests of Julius Caesar
have won him the love of the people

4
00:00:14,803 --> 00:00:17,403
and the hostility of the corrupted senate.

5
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:22,203
To counter the cult of Caesar, his enemies
lure the people with bloody spectacles

6
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:25,003
where slaves are forced to fight to the death.

7
00:00:25,303 --> 00:00:27,503
The republic is dying,

8
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:30,603
and the age of the gladiator has begun.

9
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:36,603
And before it is done, the fate of an empire
will fall upon the shoulders of one man...

10
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,703
a slave.

11
00:00:38,303 --> 00:00:39,503
A gladiator.

12
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:32,903
We prepare honors at the senate steps,
and instead Caesar brings us here.

13
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:34,803
It's smart politics.

14
00:01:34,903 --> 00:01:36,203
He gives the mob a voice.

15
00:01:36,403 --> 00:01:39,203
The senate is Rome, Brutus, not the mob.

16
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:41,303
The senate is the republic.

17
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,203
You think the rumors are true, then?

18
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:46,503
He aims to be king?

19
00:01:47,203 --> 00:01:49,303
Who else would have the nerve
to change the bloody calendar?

20
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:53,203
As if owning half the earth weren't enough,
now he aims to own the sun and moon as well.

21
00:01:53,303 --> 00:01:54,103
King?

22
00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:56,503
He aims to be a god.

23
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:04,803
Hail, Caesar! Hail, Caesar...

24
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:09,303
I see no senators on that chariot with him.

25
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:15,403
Hail, Caesar! Hail, Caesar...

26
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:30,503
Mark Anthony, you look well.

27
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:32,903
Rome's favorite son returns.

28
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:37,803
Welcome home, brother.

29
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:40,703
Dear Atia.

30
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:42,403
Octavius?

31
00:02:42,903 --> 00:02:44,503
Your nephew is delayed.

32
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:49,603
Noble Cicero.

33
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,103
Just read your latest.

34
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:53,603
Brilliant, as usual.

35
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:55,203
You're quite tough on me.

36
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:58,303
Think of it as advice from a cranky old man.

37
00:02:58,703 --> 00:03:01,503
It's your time now.
You've proven yourself a conqueror.

38
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:04,103
Now Rome needs a unifying force.

39
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,003
Wise Cassius.

40
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,703
Triumphant Caesar. Rome exults in your return.

41
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:12,468
The senate has commissioned
12 statues in your honor,

42
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:16,703
including an ivory likeness to be presented
to you at the circus games,

43
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:19,103
so deep is our gratitude.

44
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:20,503
I thank you.

45
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:25,403
Most excellent senator Brutus.

46
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:27,803
Caesar.

47
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:34,203
Look at you... a model senator.

48
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:36,403
The legion wouldn't recognize you.

49
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:38,403
I've fooled them all.

50
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,603
Enough of pageantry.

51
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:41,503
To the arena.

52
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:43,003
To sport!

53
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:53,903
Hail, Caesar! Hail, Caesar!

54
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:55,203
Citizens!

55
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,403
Citizens! Citizens!

56
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:07,503
Your gladiators fight here today
in honor of our returning hero...

57
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:12,303
the Victor at Zela, conqueror of Gaul...

58
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:15,003
Julius Caesar!

59
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:22,603
Hail, Caesar! Hail, Caesar!

60
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:29,903
First let me introduce to you

61
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,653
the most fearsome warrior

62
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:37,103
since Hannibal of Carthage,

63
00:04:37,203 --> 00:04:38,903
undefeated...

64
00:04:39,003 --> 00:04:43,503
here is the Reterian!

65
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:03,003
And his opponent...

66
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:30,003
Citizens, I present to you Rome's champion...

67
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:32,303
Tyrannus!

68
00:05:55,203 --> 00:05:56,303
Octavius!

69
00:06:24,903 --> 00:06:27,303
I see things are about as I left them.

70
00:06:35,203 --> 00:06:38,603
We, who are about to die, salute you.

71
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:05,003
I've seen Tyrannus fight.

72
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:08,403
I have 100 denarii says he makes short
work of this reterian. Cassius?

73
00:07:08,603 --> 00:07:11,903
I can't keep track of the gladiators.
They die so quickly.

74
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,103
What's the difference, uncle?

75
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:14,503
It's not like real battle.

76
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,303
They bleed just the same.

77
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:27,803
And what do you know
of real battle, Octavius?

78
00:07:28,803 --> 00:07:29,603
I've studied.

79
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:31,903
Let me show you.

80
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:33,853
Take me with you to Syria next month.

81
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:35,503
Let me fight in the Parthian wars.

82
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,603
Octavius.

83
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:40,803
No.

84
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:43,603
I have other plans for you.

85
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:54,103
You spoil him, sister.

86
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:55,003
Do I?

87
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:59,203
I wasn't the one who gave him
20 Libyan horses for his birthday.

88
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,103
They throw Rome's finest warrior to the dogs?

89
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:29,503
Yes, the mob's appetites have changed,
great Caesar.

90
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:32,303
They hunger to see the blood
of their heroes.

91
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:37,903
What kind of Roman ideal is this?

92
00:08:38,003 --> 00:08:39,303
Fight, Tyrannus!

93
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:48,203
- Caesar, now that you've returned...
- Take the day off, Cassius. Enjoy the games.

94
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:51,003
But discussing this could put
everybody at their ease.

95
00:08:51,103 --> 00:08:56,303
If you must know my mind this instant,
before I leave for Syria,
I will bring in the Decree of Rome...

96
00:08:56,403 --> 00:09:00,503
a new set of laws that redistributes
the land from the influential few

97
00:09:00,603 --> 00:09:02,703
to the people of Rome where it belongs.

98
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:12,503
Of course, the senate looks
forward to a vigorous debate.

99
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:14,903
Good. My reforms begin with the senate.

100
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:17,603
It will take old friends to see them through.

101
00:09:20,303 --> 00:09:21,603
Hail, Caesar.

102
00:10:58,903 --> 00:11:00,803
The 10th legion could use him.

103
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:05,303
Pity he's a slave.

104
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:14,503
Tyrannus! Tyrannus! Tyrannus!

105
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:23,003
Do they answer?

106
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:27,403
Your gods?

107
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:29,303
Sometimes.

108
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:30,703
Really?

109
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:32,503
How?

110
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:34,003
They give signs.

111
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:35,303
Can they send me one?

112
00:12:35,703 --> 00:12:37,703
Maybe they have and you weren't looking.

113
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:40,503
That would be my luck.

114
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:43,603
And what sort of guidance are you looking for?

115
00:12:43,703 --> 00:12:45,103
Perhaps Minerva will hear.

116
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:51,503
I'd ask her to send me far from Rome,

117
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:54,603
far from this boring life.

118
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:56,403
I hope she answers for you.

119
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,203
What's your name, Vestal?

120
00:12:58,603 --> 00:12:59,703
Camane.

121
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:07,103
I...

122
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:09,703
Sorry, I must go.

123
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:12,103
Camane!

124
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:14,603
When will Minerva answer?

125
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,803
When she answers.

126
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:19,503
Why is it you wish you were far from here?

127
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:23,403
Being the nephew of Caesar,
some would say that
the world is yours for the asking.

128
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:24,903
They would be mistaken.

129
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:27,403
My family treats me like a child.

130
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:30,903
Perhaps you act like one.

131
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:37,503
There isn't a young lady in all of Rome
who wouldn't swoon at your glance.

132
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:41,003
And yet, of all those young ladies,
you choose to give me,

133
00:13:41,703 --> 00:13:44,003
a Vestal, your attentions.

134
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:49,003
Only a child wants what it cannot have.

135
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:00,203
The Decree of Rome?

136
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:02,103
You've been keeping secrets from us.

137
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,003
I'm as surprised as you.

138
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:07,503
Really? I thought you and Caesar were like brothers.

139
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:11,203
Caesar's always kept his own counsel.
That's news to no one.

140
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:13,103
Now, what do you want?

141
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:14,803
We wish to know your heart.

142
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:19,103
For instance, if one day
you should find yourself
inheriting the mantle of Caesar,

143
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:21,703
could the senate depend upon your friendship?

144
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,803
Caesar has said nothing of succession.

145
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:26,703
You'd be blind not to see that
Caesar's forcing a confrontation.

146
00:14:26,803 --> 00:14:31,803
Apparently he's decided that the only way
to maintain his grip on power is to rob us of ours,

147
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:35,903
to destroy the republic, and anoint himself king.

148
00:14:36,103 --> 00:14:38,203
He has refused the crown,

149
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:40,103
and I take him at his word.

150
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:42,603
Your tone suggests otherwise.

151
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:46,503
I stand with Caesar.

152
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,272
- They sent four against me.
- Four, papa?

153
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:27,472
Thracians.

154
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:31,372
They fight with a shield and
a short sword. So...

155
00:15:33,272 --> 00:15:35,772
...shield. Short sword.

156
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:38,872
One... two... three...

157
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:42,172
four... five... six!

158
00:15:43,572 --> 00:15:46,572
- Get ready for bed, Piso.
- Oh, I want to...

159
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:49,672
Go, Piso. Do as your mother says.

160
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:50,872
Good night.

161
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:27,972
I don't want you to tell him these stories.

162
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,272
He doesn't understand.

163
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:28,572
Show yourself.

164
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:38,472
Hail, Caesar.

165
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:41,372
Rise, Tyrannus,

166
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:43,372
the pride of Rome.

167
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:55,872
Thank you, great Caesar.

168
00:17:56,472 --> 00:17:57,672
We've met before.

169
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:01,872
At the gladiator school in Campania.
I was a senator then.

170
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:06,072
If I'm not mistaken,
you corrected my swords manship.

171
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:11,772
You held the grip too tightly, great Caesar.

172
00:18:14,072 --> 00:18:15,172
Walk with me.

173
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:22,172
Were you born a slave, Tyrannus?

174
00:18:23,472 --> 00:18:25,272
No. I stole a horse.

175
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,172
I worked on my father's farm in Cyprus.

176
00:18:29,772 --> 00:18:32,672
The armies of Pompey were
very cruel to the people there.

177
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,772
I stole a centurion's horse
and was thrown in prison.

178
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:39,072
In prison, I was sold away
to the gladiator school.

179
00:18:39,172 --> 00:18:40,072
Difficult life.

180
00:18:40,472 --> 00:18:41,672
It was my fate.

181
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:46,672
But my victories bring some rewards
from the handlers. I've been allowed to marry.

182
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:49,972
I love my wife, my son, Piso.

183
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:52,272
- How old is Piso?
- Six years.

184
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:54,572
Does he marvel at his father, the gladiator?

185
00:18:55,672 --> 00:18:57,072
Too much, I think.

186
00:18:57,172 --> 00:18:58,372
So it should be.

187
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,772
And your dreams for him, Tyrannus?

188
00:19:04,472 --> 00:19:05,972
To not have to fight.

189
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:08,872
To live as he chooses.

190
00:19:08,972 --> 00:19:11,472
- A free man?
- Yes, of course.

191
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:16,072
I fought 10 years for the glory of Rome,

192
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:19,872
conquered five nations,
and filled our treasuries with gold.

193
00:19:21,072 --> 00:19:24,772
Yet I return, and the only growth I see
is in the size of the senators' villas.

194
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:27,072
I didn't conquer the world for them.

195
00:19:27,772 --> 00:19:30,772
Those lands and those treasures
belong to the people

196
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:33,072
and the soldiers who fought for them.

197
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,972
I intend to set it right,

198
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:37,472
and the senate will do all it can to stop me.

199
00:19:38,372 --> 00:19:40,872
So I need a warrior to stand beside me...

200
00:19:41,172 --> 00:19:45,272
one unentangled by politics,
who speaks his mind and is good with the sword.

201
00:19:46,072 --> 00:19:47,172
A bodyguard?

202
00:19:47,572 --> 00:19:50,072
That... and more.

203
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:54,372
The senate seduces the mob with blood.

204
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:57,272
But the mob loves you, Tyrannus,

205
00:19:57,372 --> 00:19:59,472
because you represent what's best in us...

206
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:02,672
strength, courage, honor.

207
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:06,472
I need you to serve me these next few weeks.

208
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:10,872
And in return... I offer this.

209
00:20:13,872 --> 00:20:15,337
The wooden sword.

210
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:19,372
Given to gladiators who show
exceptional bravery and skill in the arena.

211
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:22,172
The wooden sword means freedom.

212
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:23,972
Take it...

213
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:27,372
and your son will live in a world
without chains.

214
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:37,872
I... I don't know what to say.

215
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:39,772
Say "yes."

216
00:20:54,272 --> 00:20:58,472
I have built the greatest fighting force
in the world,

217
00:20:58,572 --> 00:21:04,072
advanced the frontiers of Roman control
from Britannia to North Africa.

218
00:21:05,172 --> 00:21:09,572
I have conquered the world for you,
the people of Rome,

219
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:13,172
not for the senators on Palatine Hill.

220
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,372
There's still time for negotiation.

221
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:16,772
Name a single law or treaty
that Caesar has not broken.

222
00:21:17,072 --> 00:21:18,372
The mob won't stand for it.

223
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:22,272
What's been set in motion cannot be unset.

224
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:27,172
Mother Noella.

225
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:31,572
- What's happened?
- The goats are sick.

226
00:21:31,672 --> 00:21:33,372
Mother Noella, it's all blood.

227
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:37,372
The midwife told me of five stillborns
this week on the Palatine Hill, all boys.

228
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:39,372
- It's gossip.
- It's omens.

229
00:21:39,572 --> 00:21:42,872
In the coming days,
I will present the Decree of Rome...

230
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:47,272
the most sweeping reforms
in constitutional law

231
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,972
since the publishing of the 12 tables.

232
00:21:50,272 --> 00:21:54,472
The college augurs warn of blood
on the ides. We must tell Caesar.

233
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,572
I'll discuss this with the arval priests,
make my decision.

234
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:59,672
And you will forget what you have seen.

235
00:22:01,672 --> 00:22:02,872
What will you do?

236
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:05,872
We need Caesar isolated.

237
00:22:38,672 --> 00:22:39,437
How much?

238
00:22:39,472 --> 00:22:40,772
Three semis, ma'am.

239
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:50,972
How beautiful.

240
00:22:58,872 --> 00:22:59,672
Piso?

241
00:23:00,872 --> 00:23:01,872
Did you see my son?

242
00:23:02,072 --> 00:23:02,772
Ma'am?

243
00:23:03,272 --> 00:23:04,072
Piso?

244
00:23:06,563 --> 00:23:07,463
Piso!

245
00:23:10,163 --> 00:23:11,063
Piso!

246
00:23:13,063 --> 00:23:14,063
Piso!

247
00:23:28,778 --> 00:23:31,678
- Tyrannus! Tyrannus!
- Moira!

248
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:33,978
What is it? What's happened?
Where's Piso?

249
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:36,178
He was there beside me
at the marketplace.

250
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:38,178
Someone must have taken him.

251
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:44,178
Wait here!

252
00:23:47,578 --> 00:23:49,678
Piso! Piso!

253
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:53,878
Have you seen a boy about six years,
this high?

254
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:55,878
There's no sign of the gladiator.

255
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:58,178
We've searched his home
in the slave barracks... nothing.

256
00:23:58,278 --> 00:23:59,578
Tyrannus will come.

257
00:23:59,978 --> 00:24:01,878
Caesar, let the senate wait.

258
00:24:01,978 --> 00:24:04,078
At least until the praetorian find Tyrannus.

259
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,178
I agree. Call it off, brother.

260
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,278
Present the Decree of Rome another time.

261
00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:10,078
There is no other time.

262
00:24:13,378 --> 00:24:14,578
Is it him?

263
00:24:15,478 --> 00:24:16,978
It's a Vestal, Caesar.

264
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:19,378
Your name, sister.

265
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:20,778
Camane, lord.

266
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:21,978
Forgive me.

267
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:26,378
What I have to say, I speak for myself,
not the order.

268
00:24:26,878 --> 00:24:29,578
The signs warn of blood on the ides of Markh.

269
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:32,278
You must not ride to Rome, not today.

270
00:24:32,378 --> 00:24:33,978
Now this. You must reconsider.

271
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:38,178
What would you have me do?
Hide under the bed?

272
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,578
That would be merry news to the senate.

273
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:41,578
But the gods.

274
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:44,778
I've lived my whole life in defiance of the gods.

275
00:24:45,178 --> 00:24:47,478
Let this day be no different.

276
00:24:51,578 --> 00:24:54,278
Man your horse. We ride.

277
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:05,878
Uncle!

278
00:25:10,878 --> 00:25:11,878
Uncle!

279
00:25:21,678 --> 00:25:24,278
Have you seen a boy about this high,
about six years?

280
00:25:25,778 --> 00:25:26,778
Piso!

281
00:25:27,578 --> 00:25:28,478
Piso!

282
00:25:29,478 --> 00:25:30,378
Piso!

283
00:25:31,178 --> 00:25:32,078
Piso!

284
00:26:05,678 --> 00:26:06,778
General...

285
00:26:08,978 --> 00:26:11,378
your presence is required for just a moment.

286
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:11,478
Papa?

287
00:27:11,578 --> 00:27:12,578
Piso!

288
00:28:12,378 --> 00:28:17,078
My brother in exile, great Caesar, I beg leniency.

289
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:20,278
This is an old issue.
There will be no pardon.

290
00:28:20,578 --> 00:28:23,578
Rise, senator Cimber, and take your seat.

291
00:29:27,778 --> 00:29:29,678
You have saved your boy.

292
00:29:29,778 --> 00:29:32,978
But who will save your beloved Caesar?

293
00:29:54,678 --> 00:29:58,178
And you, my child?

294
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:03,378
By the gods.

295
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,478
Caesar.

296
00:31:12,578 --> 00:31:14,278
- Tyrannus.
- I'm here.

297
00:31:15,878 --> 00:31:16,978
Protect him.

298
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:19,878
Protect who, great Caesar?

299
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:23,878
My heir. My successor.

300
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:25,578
Mark Anthony, of course.

301
00:31:25,613 --> 00:31:28,478
No. Not Anthony.

302
00:31:28,878 --> 00:31:30,278
Octavius.

303
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:32,978
My sister's boy.

304
00:31:34,178 --> 00:31:37,778
He will save the dream of Rome, Tyrannus.

305
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:42,278
Teach him how to fight, my friend.

306
00:31:44,378 --> 00:31:46,478
Teach him how to rule.

307
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:49,978
I will.

308
00:32:04,778 --> 00:32:05,878
Anthony.

309
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:11,678
What did he say?

310
00:32:14,478 --> 00:32:15,778
He said...

311
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,378
"protect him."

312
00:32:19,178 --> 00:32:20,378
Protect who?

313
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:24,278
Tyrannus...

314
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:29,178
protect who?

315
00:32:57,778 --> 00:32:59,878
What have these madmen done?

316
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:32,878
What if the mob turns violent?

317
00:33:35,378 --> 00:33:36,978
I've made preparations.

318
00:33:37,478 --> 00:33:38,978
And what about him?

319
00:33:48,078 --> 00:33:50,178
This was a terrible day for us all.

320
00:34:12,278 --> 00:34:13,578
Bastards.

321
00:34:15,478 --> 00:34:18,378
You stupid bastards.

322
00:34:18,678 --> 00:34:20,578
Cooler heads must prevail now, general.

323
00:34:20,613 --> 00:34:21,878
What's done is done.

324
00:34:22,578 --> 00:34:25,278
You say this to me with his blood
on your hands?

325
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:29,578
I should throw all your heads to the dogs.

326
00:34:29,678 --> 00:34:32,178
A tyrant died today, nothing more.

327
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,878
Rome is saved.

328
00:34:34,678 --> 00:34:36,378
Think carefully, general.

329
00:34:36,478 --> 00:34:39,178
This is a moment of consequence
of great history.

330
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:43,978
I would like it to be the moment that
the great powers of Rome embraced as friends...

331
00:34:44,178 --> 00:34:46,978
and united a land and a people.

332
00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:04,978
You said Anthony would be with us.

333
00:35:05,278 --> 00:35:06,778
He's the army. We need him.

334
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:08,178
He'll be back.

335
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:11,478
In the meantime, I told you,
I made preparations.

336
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:12,878
Mercenaries.

337
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:14,778
Gladiators, to be specific.

338
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:18,878
For a fee, princeps Rapax has agreed
to lead them in pursuit of our enemies.

339
00:35:18,978 --> 00:35:19,878
Which enemies?

340
00:35:19,978 --> 00:35:23,978
All Caesar loyalists are now enemies 
of the republic to be arrested
and tried for treason.

341
00:35:24,278 --> 00:35:25,778
Start with his family.

342
00:35:25,878 --> 00:35:27,678
We'll wipe his name from history.

343
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:30,578
Is this supposed to win the people's hearts?

344
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:32,778
Winning the war comes first.

345
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:35,578
Spare the women if you must.

346
00:35:37,378 --> 00:35:38,378
Now go.

347
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:05,178
- Octavius!
- Halt!

348
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:06,978
Leave him!

349
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:08,778
What in the names of the gods?

350
00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:12,978
Lady, Caesar is dead, murdered in the senate.

351
00:36:13,078 --> 00:36:13,878
You're lying.

352
00:36:14,078 --> 00:36:15,378
Where is your son?

353
00:36:15,478 --> 00:36:16,578
What do you want with my son?

354
00:36:16,678 --> 00:36:19,178
Caesar names Octavius his successor.

355
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:20,478
No. That's impossible.

356
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:22,678
Lady, there's no time.

357
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:24,978
You don't understand.
He's not involved in this.

358
00:36:25,013 --> 00:36:26,778
He is now.

359
00:36:26,878 --> 00:36:28,078
How could this have happened?

360
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:31,078
I swore an oath to Caesar to protect Octavius.

361
00:36:31,478 --> 00:36:33,078
And I will protect him.

362
00:36:33,378 --> 00:36:35,478
I won't have his blood on my hands as well.

363
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:36,478
Mother!

364
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:44,978
You... you're the gladiator.

365
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,478
Say goodbye to your mother, boy.

366
00:36:46,678 --> 00:36:48,478
- No!
- Do as I say!

367
00:36:50,378 --> 00:36:51,378
I won't.

368
00:36:51,478 --> 00:36:53,878
Your uncle has been murdered.
Go with him.

369
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,678
If what Tyrannus says is true,
then the assassins will come for you next.

370
00:36:56,713 --> 00:36:58,078
You cannot stay in Rome.

371
00:36:58,978 --> 00:36:59,878
Now go.

372
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,978
Ride, Octavius.

373
00:37:41,978 --> 00:37:45,178
The Vestal order takes no position
on the actions of the senate.

374
00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:48,178
There's talk of a purge of
Caesar's family, of loyalists.

375
00:37:48,278 --> 00:37:50,478
The institutions of Rome must intervene.

376
00:37:50,578 --> 00:37:51,978
Perhaps you can reason with these men.

377
00:37:52,078 --> 00:37:53,378
Reason, sister?

378
00:37:54,278 --> 00:37:56,578
Reason has abandoned this place.

379
00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:00,178
Not all Vestals are neutral in this.

380
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,078
When the time comes, child, I shall call on you.

381
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:06,978
Moira!

382
00:38:07,678 --> 00:38:08,578
Listen to me.

383
00:38:09,178 --> 00:38:11,978
Take Piso by carriage to the port of Ravenna.

384
00:38:12,078 --> 00:38:14,278
Buy passage on a merchant ship to Cyprus.

385
00:38:14,313 --> 00:38:15,678
Go to the inn of Balbus.

386
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:19,178
- But I don't understand.
- Stay there until I come for you.

387
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:20,678
I don't know when.

388
00:38:30,278 --> 00:38:33,278
Stay off the major roads. Travel only at night.

389
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,178
- Come soon.
- I will.

390
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:05,878
They're coming.

391
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:29,678
We'll go for the horses.

392
00:39:29,778 --> 00:39:31,178
Leave the soldiers to me.

393
00:39:31,778 --> 00:39:32,678
Take this.

394
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:36,178
If you have to use it, hold it loose,
like the reins of a horse.

395
00:39:36,978 --> 00:39:38,578
I taught your uncle that.

396
00:40:12,978 --> 00:40:13,878
Let's go!

397
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:48,878
It'll be morning soon. We'll have to ride
at least Toperugia before making camp.

398
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,978
I tried to stop him today.

399
00:41:08,178 --> 00:41:09,378
I called to him.

400
00:41:13,278 --> 00:41:14,378
He didn't hear me.

401
00:41:16,878 --> 00:41:18,378
We have to keep moving.

402
00:41:28,978 --> 00:41:35,278
Not since Alexander the Great has such a burden
been placed on the shoulders of one so young.

403
00:41:35,978 --> 00:41:39,178
And all the world hinges on the outcome.

404
00:41:39,878 --> 00:41:45,878
Watch over him, sweet Vesta,
for the trials of Octavius have begun.

405
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,310
Who ever thought a god
would hold so much blood?

406
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,010
The mob will slit our throats
when they see this.

407
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,310
They won't see this.

408
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,410
How could they miss?

409
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,710
We'll slip him quietly from the
City on the Via Attica.

410
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,710
That route's blocked.

411
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,575
The rabble chant around fires.

412
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,710
Then we'll avoid the thoroughfare and
take the footpath to Porta Ostiensis.

413
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,910
There, too, the crowd calls for revenge.

414
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:30,110
So we'll throw them a few loaves of bread.

415
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,210
- We were supposed to be heroes.
- Will you stop?

416
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,910
There's no way to get him out.

417
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,410
You said we could never do this.

418
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:39,810
Look.

419
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,310
None has ever been deader.

420
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:51,310
We'll clear a route to the city gates,
and this whole ordeal will disappear.

421
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:57,110
The mob will be quiet before he starts to stink.

422
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,810
Your path is now dark and dangerous,
young Caesar.

423
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,110
The senate has dispatched assassins to find you.

424
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,110
Stay off the major roads.

425
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:10,710
Avoid the villages.

426
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:15,410
Even in the north, they are rounding up loyalists
and burning down their houses.

427
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:19,010
But do not lose hope. You have allies.

428
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,710
Trust them. Trust us.

429
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,110
Let him see you.

430
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:12,610
What did you do that for?

431
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,710
He's an assassin.

432
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,910
Or maybe he was just going home to his family.

433
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:16,710
No.

434
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,010
Look.

435
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,210
See his sword?

436
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:25,410
He's a gladiator, armed at the arena
by the same senate that killed your uncle,

437
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:26,710
now after you.

438
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:32,510
Where are you going?

439
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:33,910
Back to Rome.

440
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:34,810
It's too dangerous.

441
00:44:34,845 --> 00:44:35,610
No.

442
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,810
This is too dangerous.

443
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,910
In Rome I have friends who know
I'm no threat to anyone.

444
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,610
I'll get senator Cimber to call off the dogs.

445
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,710
I vowed to protect you.

446
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,710
I put my family in danger.

447
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,010
Well, I didn't ask you to.

448
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:53,010
No. Caesar did when he named you his heir.

449
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,610
You say that.

450
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,710
It's nothing. Not even believable.

451
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,110
Just the word of a slave.

452
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,110
Who do you think you are?!

453
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,210
Idiot slave.

454
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,310
Highness...

455
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,810
Filthy chattel!

456
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,910
Supreme exaltedness...

457
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:15,810
Enough!

458
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,510
I said, "enough"!

459
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:30,310
Give me a hand with this.

460
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,210
Then get some sleep.

461
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:35,710
We ride tonight.

462
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:07,210
Octavius?

463
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:10,110
Octavius!

464
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,010
What are you looking at?

465
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,510
Olivia? Are you here?

466
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:07,410
Octavius?

467
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,210
I need to speak to your father.

468
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:12,010
He's at the senate.

469
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:15,910
You have no idea what I've been through.

470
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,910
We invited you, Anthony, not your soldiers.

471
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:34,210
They're not soldiers. They're bodyguards.

472
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,210
You won't need them.

473
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,310
And did Caesar?

474
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,910
He was trying to disband the senate.

475
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,610
Tell us that's not your plan, too.

476
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,410
What's gathered here?

477
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,210
Great fortunes of Rome.

478
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,710
Grain from Etruria.

479
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,310
Grapes from Sicily.

480
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,010
Oil. Cattle.

481
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,310
Shipping. Slaves.

482
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,610
All without soldiers to protect them.

483
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,910
So, what's your price?

484
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,110
So, is that what this is about?

485
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,310
The people riot.

486
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:22,610
What did you think would happen?

487
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:25,010
Caesar's blood is on your hands.

488
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,910
Fine. We're to blame. Agreed, agreed.

489
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:30,310
But Rome needs your legions
for protection. So say it --

490
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,210
what do you want?

491
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,310
I want to honor Caesar as I always have.

492
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:38,410
I want to speak at his funeral.

493
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,710
There's not going to be a funeral.

494
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:44,910
He was a traitor to the republic.

495
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:46,310
He was Caesar.

496
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:49,610
Well, he's gone. The senate's in charge now.

497
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:55,210
Well, tell that to the mob...

498
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,910
as they tear out your throats. Go on, all of you.

499
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:00,710
Tell them.

500
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,310
The senate is in charge.

501
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:12,110
Only the will of Caesar can say who's in charge.

502
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,410
The Vestals say there was no will.

503
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:17,710
They said there was none.

504
00:49:17,745 --> 00:49:19,110
Oh, it exists.

505
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:22,310
He told me not two months ago.

506
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:30,510
Caesar may be dead to his dear
and loyal friends in this room.

507
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:39,210
But the will of Caesar is still the will of Rome.

508
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,310
And until it is found,

509
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:47,210
divvying up the republic behind
closed doors is very premature.

510
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:58,610
A will?

511
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:59,910
Did it name Anthony?

512
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:01,110
Who else?

513
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,610
Why else such swagger?

514
00:50:02,645 --> 00:50:04,010
"Honor Caesar," he says.

515
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,610
He wants to turn the public against us.

516
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,875
The public is already against us.

517
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,810
We should have killed him
when we had the chance.

518
00:50:09,845 --> 00:50:10,710
Quiet.

519
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,210
We did not rid ourselves of
one tyrant to inherit another.

520
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,410
Caesar will not rule us from the grave.

521
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:20,210
Search his villa down to the joists.

522
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:22,310
Find his will. Destroy it.

523
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:26,610
What are you doing?!
You have no right!

524
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,510
I will not leave and let you
destroy Caesar's house!

525
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,010
Let me go!

526
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:35,810
Let me go. Let me go!

527
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:53,710
You're lucky Cassius wants you brought to Rome.

528
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:55,510
Otherwise, we'd kill you now.

529
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,010
So, you've been with Tyrannus, the gladiator --

530
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:12,710
the one we saw fight?

531
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:14,310
He's protecting me.

532
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:17,110
So he says.

533
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:18,910
From what?

534
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,710
I'm not sure. I need to ask your father.

535
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:22,610
What?

536
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:28,410
He was with my uncle when he died
-- Tyrannus was.

537
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:30,410
He says...

538
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:39,710
He says Caesar told him to make me
the next ruler of Rome.

539
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,110
Well, he must have hit his head hard in the arena.

540
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,610
Or maybe you have.

541
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,310
What are you laughing at?

542
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,310
Nothing. I'm not!

543
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:04,810
It's not that funny.

544
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:05,810
I'm sorry.

545
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:08,010
God. I have to get some water.

546
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:24,010
Get my father and soldiers
and tell them Octavius is here.

547
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,010
- Hurry.
- I will.

548
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:40,610
So...

549
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:44,010
emperor...

550
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:45,710
When will your father be back?

551
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,010
Not too soon.

552
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:50,510
We have just enough time.

553
00:52:59,087 --> 00:53:01,487
Caesar's blood is on my hands, mother.

554
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:03,887
Caesar's blood is on the senate's hands.

555
00:53:03,987 --> 00:53:04,787
No.

556
00:53:05,187 --> 00:53:06,487
I was his friend.

557
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:11,087
When I said yes, it convinced the others
our cause was just.

558
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,687
Your cause was just.

559
00:53:12,987 --> 00:53:14,587
You saved the republic.

560
00:53:14,687 --> 00:53:17,887
If we saved the republic,
why do we cower in our rooms,

561
00:53:17,922 --> 00:53:21,087
afraid of the people we're
supposed to have liberated?

562
00:53:21,687 --> 00:53:24,687
Why does the mob attack us
in the streets if we saved the republic?

563
00:53:24,787 --> 00:53:28,887
Why are we down on our knees to Mark Anthony,
begging him to bring order?

564
00:53:29,287 --> 00:53:31,287
You whine to me.

565
00:53:31,887 --> 00:53:33,587
I was his lover.

566
00:53:34,187 --> 00:53:36,687
No one consulted me in the deed.

567
00:53:36,887 --> 00:53:38,687
But am I crying?

568
00:53:40,987 --> 00:53:43,787
Caesar's dead, and the sun still rises,

569
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,387
and neither you nor anyone can bring him back.

570
00:53:47,787 --> 00:53:51,487
While you lament the past,
other men take position in Rome's future.

571
00:53:51,587 --> 00:53:53,987
You mean Cassius and Anthony.

572
00:53:54,587 --> 00:53:58,287
I mean you, my son.

573
00:54:00,387 --> 00:54:01,487
Why not you?

574
00:54:11,187 --> 00:54:12,587
But you're so beautiful.

575
00:54:12,787 --> 00:54:14,087
Who would want to kill you?

576
00:54:14,787 --> 00:54:15,687
Your father --

577
00:54:16,487 --> 00:54:18,387
if he sees us like this.

578
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:21,387
I think he's home.

579
00:54:24,687 --> 00:54:25,987
We'd better get up.

580
00:54:31,987 --> 00:54:33,287
What have you done?

581
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:34,987
He's in here!

582
00:55:03,287 --> 00:55:04,787
There he is! Quick! Quick!

583
00:55:29,787 --> 00:55:31,087
Idiot brat!

584
00:55:31,687 --> 00:55:34,987
Imagine Caesar's pain to realize
he had no one for his heir but you.

585
00:55:35,087 --> 00:55:38,087
I can -- I can reason with them.

586
00:55:39,387 --> 00:55:41,387
No, you can't.

587
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:55,387
Cicero.

588
00:55:55,587 --> 00:55:56,687
I got your message.

589
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,287
Have you heard anything?

590
00:55:58,387 --> 00:56:02,587
Cassius is going to move your brother's
body out of a vault near the curia.

591
00:56:02,687 --> 00:56:03,887
And what of Octavius?

592
00:56:03,987 --> 00:56:08,887
Rumor has it, the gladiator Tyrannus protects him.

593
00:56:18,787 --> 00:56:19,987
You were Caesar's friend.

594
00:56:20,087 --> 00:56:22,087
We had our differences. You know that.

595
00:56:22,187 --> 00:56:23,087
Yes.

596
00:56:24,887 --> 00:56:28,987
But the Rome Cassius destroys is the one
that you and Caesar built together.

597
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:31,887
You in the senate, him on the battlefield.

598
00:56:31,987 --> 00:56:33,587
You can't let that die.

599
00:56:33,887 --> 00:56:35,287
But what can I do?

600
00:56:36,087 --> 00:56:38,887
The conspirators huddle together in secret.

601
00:56:39,887 --> 00:56:42,787
You can let Rome know the will of Caesar.

602
00:56:43,587 --> 00:56:47,287
So a will does exist.

603
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,187
Will you help?

604
00:56:49,987 --> 00:56:51,187
Cicero...

605
00:56:51,787 --> 00:56:54,487
answer the call of Caesar one more time,

606
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:56,787
and help my son.

607
00:57:09,687 --> 00:57:12,987
What stupidity!
Siding with an enemy of the republic.

608
00:57:13,087 --> 00:57:15,987
The only enemy of the republic I see here is you.

609
00:57:16,087 --> 00:57:19,487
If you knew how your days were numbered,
you wouldn't be so flippant.

610
00:57:19,587 --> 00:57:21,687
- What are you doing?
- Out. Out!

611
00:57:25,887 --> 00:57:26,887
Stand up.

612
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:37,487
Stand up.

613
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:51,587
Where is it?

614
00:57:53,487 --> 00:57:54,687
Where is what?

615
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,287
Where is it?

616
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:29,287
You're trembling.

617
00:58:29,787 --> 00:58:31,387
Caesar names his nephew.

618
00:58:32,487 --> 00:58:33,587
Octavius.

619
00:58:33,687 --> 00:58:34,987
He's just a boy.

620
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:36,987
So was Caesar once.

621
00:58:37,087 --> 00:58:38,787
Caesar was a boy, yes.

622
00:58:39,187 --> 00:58:41,587
But not every boy is a Caesar.

623
00:58:41,887 --> 00:58:42,987
Forgive me.

624
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:46,487
I know the Vestal matriarch has sworn
the temple will not take sides.

625
00:58:46,587 --> 00:58:49,487
I take sides only with the truth
that this will exists.

626
00:58:49,587 --> 00:58:52,087
By my vows and duty, I'll keep it safe.

627
00:58:59,587 --> 00:59:00,887
What is this place?

628
00:59:11,187 --> 00:59:12,187
Where are we going?

629
00:59:12,287 --> 00:59:13,087
Keep moving.

630
00:59:13,587 --> 00:59:14,887
I won't just run away.

631
00:59:15,287 --> 00:59:16,052
We're not.

632
00:59:16,087 --> 00:59:17,287
I can clear this up.

633
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,287
Clear what up?
That you're Caesar's heir?

634
00:59:19,387 --> 00:59:20,587
Stop saying that!

635
00:59:21,787 --> 00:59:24,087
Look, what you think you heard from my uncle...

636
00:59:24,187 --> 00:59:26,687
- What I heard.
- What you think you heard... it's impossible.

637
00:59:26,722 --> 00:59:27,387
You don't know.

638
00:59:27,487 --> 00:59:28,587
You didn't know him.

639
00:59:28,987 --> 00:59:30,087
You don't know.

640
00:59:34,087 --> 00:59:36,587
He despised me. That's the truth,

641
00:59:36,687 --> 00:59:39,387
which anyone who knew him more
than 20 minutes could tell you.

642
00:59:39,587 --> 00:59:41,687
So if we could just end this charade.

643
00:59:46,387 --> 00:59:47,887
What are we doing here?

644
00:59:48,287 --> 00:59:49,587
I'll show you.

645
01:00:25,687 --> 01:00:28,487
Tell me how you'll reason
with the people who did this.

646
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,287
You don't listen to me.

647
01:00:36,087 --> 01:00:37,487
Maybe you'll listen to him.

648
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,188
My gods.

649
01:00:54,188 --> 01:00:57,388
He wouldn't want your pity.
He'd want your strength.

650
01:01:04,088 --> 01:01:05,888
Thirty stab wounds.

651
01:01:08,788 --> 01:01:10,688
And he never dropped that expression.

652
01:01:12,488 --> 01:01:13,488
Fearless.

653
01:01:14,988 --> 01:01:16,488
Giving nothing.

654
01:01:16,588 --> 01:01:18,388
Full of scorn for those who did.

655
01:01:21,088 --> 01:01:23,688
And in his dying breath,

656
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:26,088
maybe he did say something to you.

657
01:01:27,188 --> 01:01:27,988
But...

658
01:01:46,188 --> 01:01:49,088
But it was nothing compared to
what you left unsaid.

659
01:01:53,488 --> 01:01:54,788
What you did call me.

660
01:01:56,888 --> 01:01:58,188
To my face.

661
01:02:00,388 --> 01:02:02,188
Your displeasure while you lived.

662
01:02:03,488 --> 01:02:04,688
Frivolous.

663
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:07,288
Unworthy.

664
01:02:07,388 --> 01:02:10,453
Inadequate. Beneath contempt.

665
01:02:10,488 --> 01:02:12,488
Do you know that's what you called me, uncle?

666
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,988
The opposite of your heir.

667
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:23,888
Why do the gods steal glory from you now?

668
01:02:26,788 --> 01:02:29,488
Defiled by the people you save.

669
01:02:31,788 --> 01:02:33,588
You sacrificed for Rome...

670
01:02:36,088 --> 01:02:38,588
your whole life long.

671
01:02:39,988 --> 01:02:41,988
And this is how you're paid.

672
01:02:42,588 --> 01:02:44,588
I so admired you, uncle.

673
01:02:46,488 --> 01:02:48,488
I wanted to be like you.

674
01:02:49,288 --> 01:02:50,488
I really did.

675
01:02:51,988 --> 01:02:54,488
But if this is what happens to a Caesar...

676
01:02:58,288 --> 01:02:59,588
I don't want greatness.

677
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:04,088
If this is your will,

678
01:03:05,288 --> 01:03:08,288
I fail you yet again.

679
01:03:17,188 --> 01:03:18,688
So, he is with you.

680
01:03:19,088 --> 01:03:21,888
The next Caesar, as his uncle would have it.

681
01:03:21,988 --> 01:03:22,888
He does not believe it.

682
01:03:22,988 --> 01:03:25,388
Yes, well, his uncle's will leaves no doubt.

683
01:03:25,988 --> 01:03:27,588
He needs to see it.

684
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,288
I left it in the Vestal temple for safekeeping.

685
01:03:31,388 --> 01:03:32,788
Meet us there.

686
01:03:33,388 --> 01:03:34,488
Please.

687
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:38,988
A dozen men in Rome desperate to rule,

688
01:03:39,588 --> 01:03:41,288
and Caesar names him?

689
01:04:01,688 --> 01:04:04,388
They're clearing the rabble from Porta Ostiensis.

690
01:04:04,488 --> 01:04:07,888
Our little procession can exit
the City without a hitch.

691
01:04:07,923 --> 01:04:08,888
And Anthony?

692
01:04:08,988 --> 01:04:10,088
They say he's in mourning.

693
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,088
He plays with us.

694
01:04:12,188 --> 01:04:15,388
We gave him his chance.
Let him regret he said no.

695
01:04:16,688 --> 01:04:18,388
What's going on here?

696
01:04:27,688 --> 01:04:28,888
What are you doing here?

697
01:04:28,988 --> 01:04:31,688
Saying goodbye to an old friend. And you?

698
01:04:31,988 --> 01:04:34,088
What would the public think of so many wounds?

699
01:04:34,123 --> 01:04:36,188
And what would they see, a tyrant or a victim?

700
01:04:36,223 --> 01:04:37,888
They won't see anything.

701
01:04:38,488 --> 01:04:41,388
You think a cloth can hide what you've done?

702
01:04:41,488 --> 01:04:44,988
You watch your tongue.
Caesar can't protect you now.

703
01:04:45,188 --> 01:04:48,688
Do I need protecting in this free, new republic?

704
01:04:48,788 --> 01:04:51,188
You can't erase what
you've done so easily, Cassius,

705
01:04:51,288 --> 01:04:53,188
or what he's done.

706
01:04:53,388 --> 01:04:55,888
Oh, how courageous to defend
him now that he's dead.

707
01:04:55,988 --> 01:04:58,688
And where was your heroic voice
when he was alive?

708
01:04:58,788 --> 01:05:02,288
I was shouting down real tyrants
when you were a child.

709
01:05:02,588 --> 01:05:06,688
The senate hall you defiled with your knives,
I helped to build.

710
01:05:06,723 --> 01:05:08,888
You're just a mouth that flaps.

711
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:10,788
Rome has no place for you.

712
01:05:10,888 --> 01:05:12,988
You stay here, and you're as dead as Caesar.

713
01:05:13,088 --> 01:05:14,788
I swear by the gods.

714
01:05:18,088 --> 01:05:20,488
I'm on to you, grandmother.

715
01:05:20,988 --> 01:05:22,788
Now, move.

716
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:25,588
The alley.

717
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:26,788
This way.

718
01:05:33,588 --> 01:05:36,088
Something's wrong. Do you hear?

719
01:05:41,088 --> 01:05:43,888
It's Anthony. We'll be torn to pieces.

720
01:05:48,988 --> 01:05:50,488
Murderers!

721
01:05:53,088 --> 01:05:54,988
Traitors!

722
01:06:15,288 --> 01:06:17,888
Is this how the senate treats your Caesar?

723
01:06:18,288 --> 01:06:20,288
Caesar! No!

724
01:06:23,588 --> 01:06:25,188
Murderers!

725
01:06:35,626 --> 01:06:37,026
- Back inside.
- No.

726
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:40,476
- Back inside. We'll be crushed!
- If we run and hide, then what?

727
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:43,826
Cowardice now, and we've lost forever.
Or we can face this and win.

728
01:06:44,026 --> 01:06:45,926
Who told Anthony our plans?

729
01:06:46,026 --> 01:06:46,926
Not one of us.

730
01:06:47,026 --> 01:06:48,626
We should've given him his audience.

731
01:06:48,726 --> 01:06:50,726
You do not give to Anthony.

732
01:06:51,026 --> 01:06:53,026
He only understands strength.

733
01:06:53,061 --> 01:06:54,226
And the mob?

734
01:06:55,426 --> 01:06:56,826
What do they understand?

735
01:07:00,126 --> 01:07:01,026
Shame on you!

736
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:02,926
Get Atia from her cell.

737
01:07:03,126 --> 01:07:05,726
We'll use Caesar's sister to quiet this crowd.

738
01:07:05,826 --> 01:07:06,626
Go.

739
01:08:07,082 --> 01:08:09,182
This is no way to honor him.

740
01:08:21,382 --> 01:08:22,782
Friends of Caesar...

741
01:08:24,782 --> 01:08:26,082
listen to me.

742
01:08:27,182 --> 01:08:29,082
You are here uninvited.

743
01:08:30,382 --> 01:08:31,682
But you are here.

744
01:08:32,582 --> 01:08:37,682
An aggravation to those who would try
to slip Caesar from this city unnoticed,

745
01:08:38,482 --> 01:08:41,682
to deny us our grief at his passing

746
01:08:42,982 --> 01:08:45,782
and to deny him the honor he is due.

747
01:08:47,182 --> 01:08:48,682
I will not name them.

748
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:51,482
You know who they are.

749
01:08:52,382 --> 01:08:55,482
The very same senators who, one month ago,

750
01:08:55,582 --> 01:08:59,082
heaped accolades upon Caesar, all unasked for.

751
01:08:59,182 --> 01:09:00,182
What is he doing?

752
01:09:00,982 --> 01:09:03,582
Well, this is not about Caesar's rule. It's about Anthony's.

753
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:06,482
They offered him the title "emperor."

754
01:09:07,782 --> 01:09:10,682
It was Caesar turned it down.

755
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:13,782
And now they call him...

756
01:09:14,382 --> 01:09:15,382
tyrant...

757
01:09:16,782 --> 01:09:18,282
despot...

758
01:09:19,382 --> 01:09:23,382
and tell us we should be grateful
for the violence they do.

759
01:09:23,782 --> 01:09:26,182
I was asked not long ago,

760
01:09:27,082 --> 01:09:28,382
what did I want.

761
01:09:29,682 --> 01:09:32,582
What was my price...

762
01:09:33,082 --> 01:09:36,982
now that my friend is dead

763
01:09:37,182 --> 01:09:40,082
and Rome is to be divided as spoils.

764
01:09:42,182 --> 01:09:45,482
I said then, as I say now,

765
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:50,482
all I want is to honor this great Roman

766
01:09:50,582 --> 01:09:53,182
as he deserves to be honored.

767
01:10:02,482 --> 01:10:06,182
Is this how Caesar should be treated?

768
01:10:34,482 --> 01:10:35,782
Hail, Caesar!

769
01:10:36,082 --> 01:10:41,482
Hail, Caesar! Hail, Caesar! Hail, Caesar...

770
01:10:59,882 --> 01:11:00,982
Stop this.

771
01:11:01,082 --> 01:11:02,082
For you? Why should I?

772
01:11:02,182 --> 01:11:03,182
For your brother.

773
01:11:03,382 --> 01:11:06,982
For his beloved citizens,
who will be trampled if Anthony persists.

774
01:11:07,882 --> 01:11:09,282
Stop this...

775
01:11:09,482 --> 01:11:11,082
or perish in the dungeon.

776
01:11:11,782 --> 01:11:13,282
The choice is yours.

777
01:11:31,682 --> 01:11:32,982
What are you doing, Atia?

778
01:11:36,282 --> 01:11:37,382
Speak to us!

779
01:11:41,182 --> 01:11:42,582
My brother loved you.

780
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:46,682
He loved you, the people of Rome.

781
01:11:47,482 --> 01:11:50,982
It was in you, a free and proud citizenry,

782
01:11:51,082 --> 01:11:54,082
that he found the strength to do all he did.

783
01:11:54,682 --> 01:11:55,582
In you.

784
01:11:56,682 --> 01:11:58,682
Not in armies that tyrannize.

785
01:11:58,882 --> 01:12:01,782
Not in political alliance forged for personal gain.

786
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:03,082
In you.

787
01:12:04,482 --> 01:12:07,582
Everybody claims to know Caesar when it suits them.

788
01:12:08,082 --> 01:12:09,482
But I did know him.

789
01:12:09,582 --> 01:12:11,682
He was my brother, and I tell you,

790
01:12:11,882 --> 01:12:15,082
he would be touched by your presence here.

791
01:12:15,882 --> 01:12:18,282
But I must ask you to respect him now,

792
01:12:19,082 --> 01:12:21,382
to think what he would want,

793
01:12:22,282 --> 01:12:23,682
what he would do.

794
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:25,182
Caesar!

795
01:12:27,582 --> 01:12:29,482
We loved Caesar!

796
01:12:34,382 --> 01:12:36,582
I have seen his will.

797
01:12:36,882 --> 01:12:39,882
The will of Caesar -- it exists.

798
01:12:40,082 --> 01:12:43,182
And that will is Octavius --

799
01:12:43,382 --> 01:12:47,482
Caesar's one true heir, Octavius!

800
01:12:47,782 --> 01:12:49,582
Hail, Octavius!

801
01:12:50,082 --> 01:12:51,782
Octavius!

802
01:12:52,682 --> 01:12:53,782
Octavius!

803
01:12:55,682 --> 01:12:58,782
If this will exists, you show me.

804
01:12:58,882 --> 01:13:01,782
Why? So you and Cassius can both destroy it?

805
01:13:12,082 --> 01:13:14,482
- That whore dies!
- Octavius?

806
01:13:14,582 --> 01:13:16,182
It's not up to Caesar to anoint his successor.

807
01:13:16,282 --> 01:13:17,182
They're calling his name.

808
01:13:17,282 --> 01:13:19,082
You think I can't hear? Come on!

809
01:13:30,582 --> 01:13:33,682
Move along, there! Get out of my way!
I'm a senator!

810
01:13:33,782 --> 01:13:34,882
Get away from me!

811
01:14:17,482 --> 01:14:19,382
There they are! There they are!

812
01:14:19,582 --> 01:14:21,282
Move! Move! Keep moving!

813
01:14:37,582 --> 01:14:38,982
They defile him.

814
01:14:39,082 --> 01:14:39,882
No.

815
01:14:40,082 --> 01:14:41,082
No!

816
01:14:41,182 --> 01:14:42,482
They honor him.

817
01:14:42,982 --> 01:14:44,082
They do.

818
01:14:44,182 --> 01:14:46,082
I've seen it before in the arena -- felt it.

819
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:47,882
This is the mob.

820
01:14:49,082 --> 01:14:50,582
Its affections...

821
01:14:51,582 --> 01:14:53,282
your inheritance.

822
01:15:36,882 --> 01:15:42,382
Hail, Caesar! Hail, Caesar! Hail, Caesar!

823
01:15:47,682 --> 01:15:50,282
Witness the birth of a civil war.

824
01:15:50,682 --> 01:15:52,982
An empire is dawning.

825
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:55,882
An empire built on the rage of the mob.

826
01:15:56,182 --> 01:16:01,782
It is the mob who will determine
the next ruler of Rome.

827
01:16:22,973 --> 01:16:26,073
You're too young to understand
what Caesar has started.

828
01:16:26,108 --> 01:16:28,073
- His succession.
- Civil war.

829
01:16:28,273 --> 01:16:30,073
The first volley was just fired.

830
01:16:30,773 --> 01:16:33,973
And now, lists of enemies,
secret trials, heads on pikes.

831
01:16:34,073 --> 01:16:37,873
It will take a century to rebuild
what has vanished here in an instant.

832
01:16:38,273 --> 01:16:41,273
Rome, sacred Vestal, is dead.

833
01:16:41,373 --> 01:16:44,473
No, Rome lives as long as that fire burns.

834
01:16:44,573 --> 01:16:46,573
- You think so?
- Those are my vows.

835
01:16:46,673 --> 01:16:47,538
You're lucky to have them.

836
01:16:47,573 --> 01:16:51,273
As for the rest of us,
our path is highly uncertain now.

837
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:52,773
I shall be leaving Rome.

838
01:16:52,873 --> 01:16:53,673
You will return.

839
01:16:53,773 --> 01:16:54,473
No.

840
01:16:54,873 --> 01:16:58,673
Reason has fled, and locusts swarm the City,

841
01:16:58,773 --> 01:17:00,173
and my day is done.

842
01:17:04,773 --> 01:17:06,773
You think I'm a coward, don't you?

843
01:17:06,973 --> 01:17:07,873
No.

844
01:17:09,673 --> 01:17:11,673
No. I think you're quite brave.

845
01:17:13,573 --> 01:17:16,773
But these times may need
all of us to be braver still.

846
01:17:19,173 --> 01:17:21,773
Cicero, is that it -- the will?

847
01:17:22,673 --> 01:17:23,973
I don't want to see it.

848
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:26,573
Read it to him, then.
Read it and be done.

849
01:17:26,673 --> 01:17:27,173
No!

850
01:17:27,273 --> 01:17:28,173
Stop.

851
01:17:29,173 --> 01:17:30,973
Consider your place.

852
01:17:36,673 --> 01:17:37,673
Sit.

853
01:17:44,973 --> 01:17:47,173
We met just a few days ago.

854
01:17:47,373 --> 01:17:48,673
It seems a lifetime.

855
01:17:48,773 --> 01:17:49,773
Yes.

856
01:17:55,373 --> 01:17:56,773
They consumed him.

857
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:59,173
The crowd did.

858
01:17:59,873 --> 01:18:01,573
Screaming his name.

859
01:18:04,473 --> 01:18:06,273
And they were screaming for me.

860
01:18:06,573 --> 01:18:07,873
But not you.

861
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:10,973
Caesar.

862
01:18:11,073 --> 01:18:13,973
For in the eyes of the crowd,
you're already no longer yourself.

863
01:18:14,673 --> 01:18:16,473
I don't want to be Caesar.

864
01:18:16,573 --> 01:18:17,973
I'm sure you don't.

865
01:18:20,773 --> 01:18:22,673
I was called by your uncle.

866
01:18:23,773 --> 01:18:25,273
Did you know that?

867
01:18:26,973 --> 01:18:29,473
At the age of six. That's when we start.

868
01:18:30,573 --> 01:18:33,373
I was just taken from my home, placed here...

869
01:18:34,373 --> 01:18:39,373
and my instruction began.
They told me it was an honor

870
01:18:39,973 --> 01:18:44,773
to be one of the only six Vestals
in all of Rome. But it didn't feel like an honor.

871
01:18:47,073 --> 01:18:48,473
Not at all.

872
01:18:50,973 --> 01:18:53,973
I know what it is to feel overwhelmed.

873
01:18:56,973 --> 01:19:00,273
And I know what goes with that
-- to feel unworthy.

874
01:19:01,273 --> 01:19:03,773
But the decisions in this,
they're not ours to make.

875
01:19:03,873 --> 01:19:06,373
As always I'm a Vestal, and always...

876
01:19:07,573 --> 01:19:09,573
you will be Caesar.

877
01:19:11,173 --> 01:19:13,073
- So it's true, then.
- Yes.

878
01:19:16,073 --> 01:19:17,873
He names me successor.

879
01:19:18,973 --> 01:19:21,073
He named you his son.

880
01:19:26,673 --> 01:19:30,973
Gaius Octavius Caesar,

881
01:19:32,173 --> 01:19:33,873
as if you were his own.

882
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:40,673
And this is his ring,
entrusted to us for safekeeping.

883
01:19:42,473 --> 01:19:44,973
It's yours now, truly.

884
01:20:06,273 --> 01:20:07,673
Take this, my friend.

885
01:20:08,173 --> 01:20:10,373
The names of the few who will help.

886
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:12,573
Protect him.

887
01:20:13,073 --> 01:20:14,373
Protect them.

888
01:20:15,873 --> 01:20:17,273
Protect us all.

889
01:20:18,473 --> 01:20:20,173
In the name of the senate, open this door.

890
01:20:23,073 --> 01:20:25,673
There are horses outside the city wall, this way.

891
01:20:26,973 --> 01:20:28,773
Are you mad? What are you doing?

892
01:20:32,973 --> 01:20:34,273
This is a violation!

893
01:20:34,373 --> 01:20:36,673
You two, check the storeroom!
You, the back!

894
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:39,573
This is sacrilege!
Don't you lay a finger on her!

895
01:20:46,273 --> 01:20:48,473
What have you brought to us?

896
01:21:17,473 --> 01:21:18,373
Where are we going?

897
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:19,473
Far from here.

898
01:21:19,873 --> 01:21:21,973
Cicero has given us a place to begin.

899
01:21:27,673 --> 01:21:28,673
Trust me.

900
01:21:28,973 --> 01:21:30,373
I swore an oath.

901
01:21:30,773 --> 01:21:32,773
You leave Rome a hunted boy,

902
01:21:33,573 --> 01:21:35,773
but you'll return an emperor.

903
01:22:07,788 --> 01:22:11,382
The smoke of the fires
has obscured the moon over Rome,

904
01:22:11,482 --> 01:22:14,679
just as the lies of the senate
have hidden the truth.

905
01:22:14,778 --> 01:22:18,773
Cassius wants the people to believe
that Caesar was a tyrant.

906
01:22:18,873 --> 01:22:22,967
If no one refutes this, it will become history.

907
01:22:26,363 --> 01:22:30,557
I am a Vestal virgin,
one of only six in all the world.

908
01:22:30,657 --> 01:22:33,852
My duty is to tend to the sacred flame.

909
01:22:35,151 --> 01:22:38,646
Vestals are forbidden to engage in politics.

910
01:22:41,443 --> 01:22:44,443
Though I am a Vestal, I am a Roman first,

911
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:47,040
and I swear the people will know the truth.

912
01:22:48,637 --> 01:22:54,129
By morning light, I will see Caesar's will
and testament nailed to every door in Rome.

913
01:23:22,492 --> 01:23:23,690
Listen, listen.

914
01:23:25,787 --> 01:23:26,986
Is it official?

915
01:23:28,084 --> 01:23:29,383
Read it out loud.

916
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:37,865
10 denarii for the name of the traitor
that posted this!

917
01:23:38,464 --> 01:23:39,362
Traitor?

918
01:23:40,961 --> 01:23:41,959
No, no, no.

919
01:23:42,259 --> 01:23:44,855
From here, where your strength lies.

920
01:23:44,955 --> 01:23:45,655
Again.

921
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:47,252
You don't have to do this.

922
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:51,047
Go take care of your family.

923
01:23:51,147 --> 01:23:52,744
My family is my business. Again.

924
01:23:54,043 --> 01:23:56,144
They've probably reached Cyprus by now.

925
01:23:56,844 --> 01:23:58,341
I don't want to speak of them...

926
01:23:59,539 --> 01:24:00,439
ever.

927
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:08,129
Now, try again.

928
01:24:12,723 --> 01:24:15,218
We'll be at Magonius' villa
before the end of the day.

929
01:24:16,018 --> 01:24:20,212
Maybe Magonius is the wrong place
to look for support.

930
01:24:20,312 --> 01:24:22,809
Cicero has him at the top of his list of likely allies.

931
01:24:22,844 --> 01:24:23,808
So, tell me,

932
01:24:24,007 --> 01:24:27,702
how do I convince a seasoned general
he should commit his army to me?

933
01:24:27,737 --> 01:24:28,800
I thought you said you knew him.

934
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,099
From parties,

935
01:24:30,299 --> 01:24:32,995
where I most likely tried to seduce his daughter.

936
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:46,178
No one expects you...

937
01:24:47,276 --> 01:24:49,573
to win a war single-handedly.

938
01:24:50,472 --> 01:24:54,067
Just tell this Magonius your plan
and let fate determine the rest.

939
01:25:00,258 --> 01:25:02,455
What plan?

940
01:25:15,841 --> 01:25:17,340
This gate should be locked.

941
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,937
What does a general have to fear?

942
01:25:20,036 --> 01:25:21,035
Something's wrong.

943
01:25:26,128 --> 01:25:27,326
You invade my home?!

944
01:25:27,526 --> 01:25:29,024
I will see you all hanged!

945
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:33,219
The senate demands that you commit
the fourth legion to its defense.

946
01:25:33,319 --> 01:25:35,914
If Cassius was man enough to demand it himself,

947
01:25:36,014 --> 01:25:37,313
he'd leave here without his head.

948
01:25:37,413 --> 01:25:40,309
You're in no position to make threats, Magonius.

949
01:25:40,408 --> 01:25:42,506
I'm not in the habit of making threats.

950
01:25:42,541 --> 01:25:44,204
And I will not be intimidated,

951
01:25:44,404 --> 01:25:46,501
at least not by the likes of Cassius.

952
01:25:46,536 --> 01:25:47,999
Sir, over here!

953
01:25:56,187 --> 01:25:57,286
My slaves.

954
01:25:58,984 --> 01:26:01,281
Back to the fields! Away from my house!

955
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:03,078
Farm slaves?

956
01:26:03,278 --> 01:26:04,577
Take them, also.

957
01:26:04,876 --> 01:26:07,937
I will not tolerate the confiscation of my property.

958
01:26:07,972 --> 01:26:11,468
Oh, you'll tolerate a lot more
than that where you're headed.

959
01:26:11,866 --> 01:26:13,165
Take him.

960
01:26:13,565 --> 01:26:14,563
Right, sir.

961
01:26:14,763 --> 01:26:15,662
Let's go.

962
01:26:18,063 --> 01:26:19,061
Come on, come on.

963
01:26:21,558 --> 01:26:25,053
Cassius, Caesar's will is on the street,
posted everywhere.

964
01:26:25,153 --> 01:26:27,649
There are accusations that
a Vestal virgin distributed it.

965
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:28,948
Well, that sounds like an invention.

966
01:26:29,048 --> 01:26:30,246
There are witnesses.

967
01:26:30,646 --> 01:26:33,042
Did you know that he left the majority of his fortune

968
01:26:33,142 --> 01:26:34,340
to the common people of Rome?

969
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,837
Well, he pandered to them
because he knew they were his only power base.

970
01:26:36,937 --> 01:26:38,336
He cared what they thought of him.

971
01:26:38,371 --> 01:26:39,334
What's your point?

972
01:26:39,434 --> 01:26:42,430
Plebeians are on the street killing senators,

973
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:43,728
chanting, "assassins!"

974
01:26:43,828 --> 01:26:45,226
That doesn't disturb you?

975
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:48,322
There's so much suffering in this room. Am I with a woman?

976
01:26:48,921 --> 01:26:52,666
The mob must understand that
the senate, not Caesar, now rules.

977
01:26:52,701 --> 01:26:56,411
We'll begin by appointing consuls
to replace him and Anthony --

978
01:26:56,446 --> 01:26:59,007
Caesar loyalists that please the mob,

979
01:26:59,042 --> 01:27:01,104
yet men we can control.

980
01:27:01,204 --> 01:27:04,800
Taking Anthony's consulship is
like poking a caged tiger.

981
01:27:07,182 --> 01:27:08,082
Good.

982
01:27:08,281 --> 01:27:11,976
Let him understand that without us,
he has no legitimacy.

983
01:27:12,076 --> 01:27:14,273
Let his hand be forced!

984
01:27:15,771 --> 01:27:17,968
I am so sick of your fear!

985
01:27:28,255 --> 01:27:29,621
Rapax, clean your feet.

986
01:27:29,656 --> 01:27:31,654
You're paying a visit to the Vestal temple.

987
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:44,137
For you, Octavius.

988
01:27:53,624 --> 01:27:57,120
Only the pontifex maximus of Rome
has authority here.

989
01:27:59,716 --> 01:28:01,214
Is this the Vestal Camane?

990
01:28:01,314 --> 01:28:02,412
I'm not hiding.

991
01:28:02,612 --> 01:28:06,308
She will be taken into our custody
to determine whether she's an enemy of Rome.

992
01:28:06,343 --> 01:28:07,306
No.

993
01:28:09,403 --> 01:28:10,402
Bring her here.

994
01:28:10,502 --> 01:28:12,764
Lay a hand on one of our order,

995
01:28:12,799 --> 01:28:15,894
and you risk far worse than
your commander's displeasure.

996
01:28:16,893 --> 01:28:20,089
If the citizens of Rome do not strike you down,

997
01:28:20,488 --> 01:28:21,987
Vesta surely will.

998
01:28:22,086 --> 01:28:22,985
Sir?

999
01:28:36,067 --> 01:28:37,865
Expect a return visit.

1000
01:28:46,757 --> 01:28:49,254
What happens when I can
no longer protect you?

1001
01:28:54,547 --> 01:28:56,444
Move to the right! Keep moving!

1002
01:28:57,743 --> 01:28:58,641
Faster!

1003
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,835
My dreams are filled with blood, with torture.

1004
01:29:02,935 --> 01:29:05,732
I cannot tell if it is Octavius' or my own.

1005
01:29:05,932 --> 01:29:08,993
I've defied the Vestal order by choosing sides.

1006
01:29:09,028 --> 01:29:12,123
If I am charged with treason,
the punishment is death.

1007
01:29:12,323 --> 01:29:15,719
I will be buried to the neck,
and my head broken with stones.

1008
01:29:15,819 --> 01:29:19,513
And if the senate finds Octavius,
his execution is certain.

1009
01:29:23,781 --> 01:29:24,674
Get in line!

1010
01:29:27,553 --> 01:29:28,846
Now's your opportunity.

1011
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:31,925
Go on.

1012
01:29:33,711 --> 01:29:34,409
You!

1013
01:29:36,494 --> 01:29:37,883
Arrogant fool.

1014
01:29:38,876 --> 01:29:41,461
They're gladiators hired by the senate.

1015
01:29:41,955 --> 01:29:43,248
That money will run out.

1016
01:29:43,841 --> 01:29:45,927
Cassius doesn't understand that yet.

1017
01:29:46,327 --> 01:29:49,006
He's like a little boy with wooden soldiers.

1018
01:29:49,106 --> 01:29:50,399
Why is he doing this to you?

1019
01:29:52,085 --> 01:29:53,478
He wants the fourth legion,

1020
01:29:54,471 --> 01:29:55,661
like you do.

1021
01:29:55,858 --> 01:29:56,655
It's true.

1022
01:29:56,753 --> 01:29:57,944
I need your support.

1023
01:29:58,543 --> 01:30:01,621
Cicero suggested you might sway
your soldiers to join me.

1024
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:05,344
I prefer not to discuss politics when I'm in chains.

1025
01:30:05,379 --> 01:30:08,373
I recommend you concentrate
on the problems at hand.

1026
01:30:08,968 --> 01:30:10,359
Quit talking, you two.

1027
01:30:26,447 --> 01:30:27,740
Keep walking.

1028
01:30:28,334 --> 01:30:30,619
Can't put a man of my station here.

1029
01:30:33,662 --> 01:30:34,662
Where are we?

1030
01:30:40,783 --> 01:30:43,276
the combat dungeons of Arkham.

1031
01:31:15,299 --> 01:31:16,402
This way, general.

1032
01:31:17,807 --> 01:31:18,910
Don't look at him.

1033
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:20,213
Don't look at him!

1034
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:24,223
Don't look at anyone.

1035
01:31:25,026 --> 01:31:26,329
They'll think I'm weak.

1036
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:27,833
Those are gladiator chieftains,

1037
01:31:27,934 --> 01:31:30,441
choosing slaves for death in the ring.

1038
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:32,146
This is a combat prison.

1039
01:31:32,246 --> 01:31:35,054
If you show any sign of courage,
you'll be selected to fight.

1040
01:31:35,355 --> 01:31:37,560
I'm sure they'd be easier adversaries than you.

1041
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:40,768
As fresh meat, all they'll give you is
a wooden sword...

1042
01:31:40,969 --> 01:31:42,071
against that.

1043
01:31:46,484 --> 01:31:48,189
And if you survive, you're a gladiator.

1044
01:31:48,289 --> 01:31:48,791
Is that it?

1045
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:50,896
99 out of 100 don't survive.

1046
01:31:50,996 --> 01:31:52,601
And don't turn your back on a chief.

1047
01:31:52,702 --> 01:31:54,206
It's a mark of disrespect.

1048
01:31:54,305 --> 01:31:56,512
Don't do anything that makes you stand out,

1049
01:31:56,612 --> 01:31:59,018
because if you do, they'll put you in the ring,

1050
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:00,824
and in the ring, you will die.

1051
01:32:01,425 --> 01:32:02,528
Do you hear me?

1052
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:04,332
Octavius?

1053
01:32:11,251 --> 01:32:12,857
This one's wearing oils.

1054
01:32:13,258 --> 01:32:16,165
They perfume their whores that way in the city.

1055
01:32:18,070 --> 01:32:20,677
You trying to make your masters sneeze,

1056
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:22,984
pleasure boy?

1057
01:32:27,898 --> 01:32:30,304
Are you showing me your eyes?

1058
01:32:31,507 --> 01:32:34,816
I'll show you the faces of the gods
if I get the chance.

1059
01:32:42,337 --> 01:32:45,245
The next time your eyes see mine,

1060
01:32:45,645 --> 01:32:48,354
I'll be spitting in your dead mouth...

1061
01:32:50,057 --> 01:32:51,261
whore.

1062
01:33:12,218 --> 01:33:15,427
Mark Anthony has disappeared
and left Rome to burn.

1063
01:33:15,527 --> 01:33:19,237
The senate has no choice but
to strip him of his consulship.

1064
01:33:19,337 --> 01:33:21,544
In this vein, we nominate

1065
01:33:22,045 --> 01:33:23,448
the noble Cimber

1066
01:33:24,051 --> 01:33:26,858
and the noble Quintilius as our new leaders.

1067
01:33:28,557 --> 01:33:31,264
I thank you both most dearly, but

1068
01:33:31,565 --> 01:33:32,868
I must decline.

1069
01:33:32,903 --> 01:33:33,971
Decline?

1070
01:33:34,573 --> 01:33:36,378
I'm needed on my lands.

1071
01:33:36,679 --> 01:33:38,885
My cattle are diseased, you see?

1072
01:33:39,386 --> 01:33:43,497
Though, of course, it pains me to be robbed
of the privilege of serving as consul.

1073
01:33:43,999 --> 01:33:44,901
Very well.

1074
01:33:45,302 --> 01:33:48,811
I'm sure the economic stewardship
of Quintilius will leave us in good stead.

1075
01:33:48,913 --> 01:33:51,118
Who will partner noble Quintilius?

1076
01:33:51,219 --> 01:33:54,929
- I'm losing my vision.
- What?

1077
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:58,738
I have these spots in my eyes.

1078
01:33:59,141 --> 01:34:00,444
I'm nearly blind.

1079
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:04,655
The consulship would require too much reading.

1080
01:34:05,055 --> 01:34:06,760
It's impossible, I'm afraid.

1081
01:34:06,962 --> 01:34:10,070
I put forth Cassius and Brutus
to serve as consuls.

1082
01:34:10,170 --> 01:34:11,374
Oh, agreed.

1083
01:34:12,477 --> 01:34:15,985
Their guidance through this difficult period
has been both shrewd and statesmanlike.

1084
01:34:16,086 --> 01:34:17,891
Let's not game each other, gentlemen.

1085
01:34:17,991 --> 01:34:21,801
In the public's view, we are the killers
of their beloved Caesar.

1086
01:34:21,836 --> 01:34:25,613
I'm sure you good men will not ignore your duty.

1087
01:34:25,713 --> 01:34:28,019
You made this stew, Cassius.

1088
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:30,425
Don't expect us to eat it.

1089
01:34:32,732 --> 01:34:38,346
Should any of you expect on going protection
from the rioters, alert us now.

1090
01:34:39,149 --> 01:34:41,255
The number of our guards is growing limited.

1091
01:34:41,756 --> 01:34:43,962
We wouldn't want to forget anyone.

1092
01:34:46,971 --> 01:34:51,281
I'm sure Quintilius and myself can
find suitable candidates for consul.

1093
01:35:01,008 --> 01:35:03,113
Just keep walking.

1094
01:35:03,215 --> 01:35:05,621
And for mercy's sake, keep your eyes down.

1095
01:35:27,692 --> 01:35:28,595
Hurry up!

1096
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:35,513
Move yourselves!

1097
01:35:38,221 --> 01:35:40,026
No fight, no food.

1098
01:35:43,635 --> 01:35:44,739
Does it hurt?

1099
01:35:46,142 --> 01:35:46,945
Good.

1100
01:35:47,044 --> 01:35:48,950
Maybe pain will give you some sense.

1101
01:35:50,554 --> 01:35:51,758
I'm a Caesar.

1102
01:35:52,259 --> 01:35:54,666
I will not dishonor myself
by displays of cowardice.

1103
01:35:54,701 --> 01:35:56,370
You think suicide is brave?

1104
01:35:56,471 --> 01:35:58,676
You could have used your famous might
to stand with me,

1105
01:35:58,777 --> 01:36:00,330
which is supposed to be your job.

1106
01:36:00,365 --> 01:36:01,884
You don't understand. I'm known here.

1107
01:36:01,986 --> 01:36:03,891
By whom? No one recognizes you.

1108
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:05,094
Not by my face.

1109
01:36:05,194 --> 01:36:06,699
But I fight in the style of a Cypriot.

1110
01:36:06,798 --> 01:36:08,845
If I engage in battle with this man,
I'll kill him,

1111
01:36:08,951 --> 01:36:10,876
and they'll soon identify me
as Tyrannus of Rome.

1112
01:36:10,904 --> 01:36:12,460
Then you are revealed to your enemies.

1113
01:36:16,109 --> 01:36:18,281
I cannot protect you here.

1114
01:36:32,885 --> 01:36:33,450
Drink.

1115
01:36:34,449 --> 01:36:35,950
I don't want your pampering, mother.

1116
01:36:36,846 --> 01:36:38,745
If I'm in the mood to nurture,

1117
01:36:38,941 --> 01:36:40,941
I suggest you take advantage of it.

1118
01:36:41,041 --> 01:36:45,434
Our general Rapax failed to deliver
the Vestal Camane as ordered.

1119
01:36:45,535 --> 01:36:47,330
- Has she fled the city?
- No.

1120
01:36:47,429 --> 01:36:51,125
His courageous soldiers refuse
to move against the sisterhood,

1121
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,820
fearing the retribution of the goddess Vesta.

1122
01:36:54,318 --> 01:36:56,415
What authority will move them?

1123
01:36:56,816 --> 01:36:58,413
This can't go unpunished.

1124
01:36:58,513 --> 01:37:00,609
Caesar was pontifex maximus,

1125
01:37:00,809 --> 01:37:03,006
the highest religious authority in the state.

1126
01:37:03,106 --> 01:37:06,699
Like consul, it's one ofthe many offices
he held that now stands empty.

1127
01:37:06,799 --> 01:37:08,098
Since his death,

1128
01:37:08,397 --> 01:37:10,793
there's been no replacement.

1129
01:37:11,193 --> 01:37:12,790
But a new pontifex?

1130
01:37:13,389 --> 01:37:14,687
Can we do that?

1131
01:37:14,787 --> 01:37:16,185
Fetch us olives, mother.

1132
01:37:16,385 --> 01:37:18,281
Get your own olives.

1133
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,543
I've examined the writs.

1134
01:37:20,578 --> 01:37:25,271
During times of great crisis,
the pontifex may be appointed by senate decree.

1135
01:37:36,155 --> 01:37:38,350
Your mother's a clever witch, Brutus.

1136
01:37:40,647 --> 01:37:43,942
Whom do you favor as the new pontifex?

1137
01:37:58,518 --> 01:38:00,415
Take your new hat

1138
01:38:00,516 --> 01:38:02,712
and solve my Vestal problem.

1139
01:38:04,809 --> 01:38:05,507
Now.

1140
01:38:17,489 --> 01:38:19,785
Awaken to die!

1141
01:38:20,883 --> 01:38:23,280
Awaken to die!

1142
01:38:24,278 --> 01:38:26,873
Awaken to die!

1143
01:38:28,571 --> 01:38:30,967
Awaken to die!

1144
01:38:34,169 --> 01:38:36,966
Which one of you will be today's fresh meat?

1145
01:38:41,259 --> 01:38:43,156
Give the general a seat of honor.

1146
01:38:44,254 --> 01:38:45,652
It could be his last.

1147
01:39:02,725 --> 01:39:05,321
You -- pleasure boy.

1148
01:39:22,494 --> 01:39:24,891
He stole that move from Tyrannus of Rome.

1149
01:39:24,991 --> 01:39:27,187
I saw Tyrannus do it in Cyprus.

1150
01:39:33,876 --> 01:39:35,674
I want his face!

1151
01:39:35,774 --> 01:39:39,668
Face! Face! Face! Face!...

1152
01:39:47,455 --> 01:39:49,252
The whore is my property!

1153
01:39:54,944 --> 01:39:57,340
If anyone should have his face on a sword,

1154
01:39:57,539 --> 01:39:58,637
it's me.

1155
01:40:20,104 --> 01:40:22,599
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!...

1156
01:40:25,097 --> 01:40:26,195
Fight me.

1157
01:40:26,894 --> 01:40:29,389
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!...

1158
01:40:45,165 --> 01:40:48,858
Spare him! Spare him! Spare him!...

1159
01:40:50,656 --> 01:40:51,954
He's spared.

1160
01:41:13,548 --> 01:41:15,246
Protect Octavius.

1161
01:41:15,645 --> 01:41:16,545
Not ready.

1162
01:41:17,145 --> 01:41:19,341
Teach him how to fight, my friend.

1163
01:41:19,638 --> 01:41:21,836
Teach him how to rule.

1164
01:41:21,935 --> 01:41:23,335
Hail Caesar!

1165
01:41:23,732 --> 01:41:26,428
That jackal guard will be around again soon.

1166
01:41:27,127 --> 01:41:28,225
So be it.

1167
01:41:28,724 --> 01:41:31,121
We don't get to pick which day's our last.

1168
01:41:32,118 --> 01:41:33,718
Dying is easy.

1169
01:41:34,017 --> 01:41:36,611
Keeping yourself alive is a task worthier of you.

1170
01:41:36,646 --> 01:41:38,712
My eyes are open, Tyrannus.

1171
01:41:39,406 --> 01:41:41,204
I'm unarmed and marked for death.

1172
01:41:41,305 --> 01:41:43,205
You don't know what you're marked for.

1173
01:41:45,299 --> 01:41:46,397
Pay attention.

1174
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:53,887
My arm's extended straight.
Where am I weak?

1175
01:41:53,988 --> 01:41:54,452
I don't know.

1176
01:41:54,487 --> 01:41:56,783
You said your eyes were open. Now, use them.

1177
01:41:57,579 --> 01:41:58,979
- The elbow.
- Good.

1178
01:41:59,679 --> 01:42:02,475
You pull me forward, step to the outside.

1179
01:42:02,573 --> 01:42:03,371
Try it.

1180
01:42:04,967 --> 01:42:05,668
Again.

1181
01:42:06,166 --> 01:42:07,065
You're weak.

1182
01:42:07,164 --> 01:42:08,164
Again.

1183
01:42:10,261 --> 01:42:11,158
Better.

1184
01:42:11,757 --> 01:42:12,558
Good.

1185
01:42:12,657 --> 01:42:14,054
- Like with the sword, right?
- Mm-hmm.

1186
01:42:30,828 --> 01:42:32,625
My son Piso...

1187
01:42:34,722 --> 01:42:36,120
his lungs are weak.

1188
01:42:37,518 --> 01:42:39,914
I'm worried he'll catch cold on his journey.

1189
01:42:40,213 --> 01:42:41,910
It's my fault, all of it.

1190
01:42:47,002 --> 01:42:48,601
I should have kept my eyes down.

1191
01:42:51,396 --> 01:42:52,894
Leave me with your master, boy.

1192
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:15,559
This is Gaul.

1193
01:43:16,556 --> 01:43:18,852
They use smaller tridents there.

1194
01:43:23,846 --> 01:43:25,242
And this...

1195
01:43:28,637 --> 01:43:30,036
a leopard's claws.

1196
01:43:30,135 --> 01:43:31,632
I'm unlucky with animals.

1197
01:43:31,733 --> 01:43:35,527
Especially when they've been
unleashed in an arena, hmm?

1198
01:43:36,026 --> 01:43:37,424
Like in Dalmatia?

1199
01:43:37,523 --> 01:43:40,320
I served in Caesar's armies
-- nothing more.

1200
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:45,412
Be as mysterious as you like.
You still dropped your hands to me,

1201
01:43:45,511 --> 01:43:48,507
which means I'll have to do you over slow

1202
01:43:48,806 --> 01:43:50,703
and ugly next time.

1203
01:43:58,491 --> 01:43:59,390
Water!

1204
01:44:03,083 --> 01:44:04,681
Have you gotten word out of here?

1205
01:44:04,781 --> 01:44:06,079
Is someone coming for you?

1206
01:44:06,179 --> 01:44:07,577
I can't reveal myself.

1207
01:44:07,776 --> 01:44:10,871
Your companion -- clearly,
he's not some house slave. Who is he?

1208
01:44:10,972 --> 01:44:12,969
A gladiator of some renown.

1209
01:44:13,068 --> 01:44:15,464
His identity must be shielded here as well as mine.

1210
01:44:15,565 --> 01:44:18,361
A brave servant isn't enough in here, young Caesar.

1211
01:44:18,559 --> 01:44:19,957
Offer him up if you have to.

1212
01:44:20,058 --> 01:44:21,254
He'd be executed.

1213
01:44:21,954 --> 01:44:24,150
His beating was intended for me.

1214
01:44:24,251 --> 01:44:26,447
He sent his family into hardship for me.

1215
01:44:26,548 --> 01:44:27,844
You ask for my help,

1216
01:44:27,945 --> 01:44:29,242
for my legion.

1217
01:44:29,742 --> 01:44:32,238
Then show the resolve your uncle had

1218
01:44:32,337 --> 01:44:33,801
to do what is necessary.

1219
01:44:33,836 --> 01:44:35,732
Are you saying you'd betray a loyal soldier

1220
01:44:35,833 --> 01:44:37,429
who more than once saved your life?

1221
01:44:37,530 --> 01:44:39,726
I'm not claiming to be the next ruler of Rome.

1222
01:44:39,827 --> 01:44:40,824
You are.

1223
01:44:41,124 --> 01:44:43,820
Steel in a Caesar's sword is useful.

1224
01:44:44,419 --> 01:44:47,714
Steel in a Caesar's heart is imperative.

1225
01:44:55,565 --> 01:44:56,364
Go.

1226
01:45:04,352 --> 01:45:06,349
So, boy,

1227
01:45:06,847 --> 01:45:08,346
you know the general?

1228
01:45:09,444 --> 01:45:11,041
I'm his farm slave.

1229
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:13,937
A noble man's son...

1230
01:45:15,534 --> 01:45:16,831
that's what you are.

1231
01:45:18,829 --> 01:45:20,826
A noble man's son...

1232
01:45:22,224 --> 01:45:23,621
without protection.

1233
01:45:26,018 --> 01:45:27,716
Do you know the mother tongue?

1234
01:45:29,112 --> 01:45:31,509
Because I will be answered when I speak.

1235
01:45:40,594 --> 01:45:44,389
I'll see your heart turned on a spit.

1236
01:45:44,489 --> 01:45:45,686
Well, come and get it!

1237
01:45:47,384 --> 01:45:49,382
You're worth more to me alive.

1238
01:46:25,824 --> 01:46:26,722
Leave us.

1239
01:46:34,311 --> 01:46:35,509
Noble pontifex.

1240
01:46:35,708 --> 01:46:37,706
I'm not a noble pontifex.

1241
01:46:39,304 --> 01:46:41,699
I'm a political actor, as are you,

1242
01:46:42,497 --> 01:46:45,191
in a drama that's fast becoming a farce.

1243
01:46:45,692 --> 01:46:48,990
Why did you post the will of a dead tyrant
on the doors of the senate?

1244
01:46:49,087 --> 01:46:52,284
A dead tyrant who counted you
amongst his friends, I thought.

1245
01:46:52,385 --> 01:46:53,880
Answer my question.

1246
01:46:54,379 --> 01:46:56,177
The people that loved Caesar

1247
01:46:56,278 --> 01:46:58,675
deserve to know his last wishes.

1248
01:46:59,571 --> 01:47:02,966
You must denounce Caesar's will
and throw your voice behind the senate.

1249
01:47:03,168 --> 01:47:06,059
My vow is to Vesta, and I will not displease her

1250
01:47:06,094 --> 01:47:07,957
by parroting the lies of assassins.

1251
01:47:08,058 --> 01:47:09,756
No sanctuary can protect you, girl,

1252
01:47:09,857 --> 01:47:12,450
if you are officially accused of treason.

1253
01:47:18,828 --> 01:47:21,723
Is there no mercy in your maiden's heart

1254
01:47:23,019 --> 01:47:26,514
for a man pulled between love
of his friend and duty...

1255
01:47:27,814 --> 01:47:29,410
to his republic?

1256
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:32,005
Vesta has mercy

1257
01:47:32,406 --> 01:47:34,302
and love for such a man

1258
01:47:34,502 --> 01:47:37,897
but only if he alters course
-- if he decides to live in truth and honor.

1259
01:47:37,998 --> 01:47:38,795
Truth?

1260
01:47:39,195 --> 01:47:40,793
Yes, and honor.

1261
01:47:51,176 --> 01:47:54,670
An altar asking the gods' protection.
For whom?

1262
01:47:55,868 --> 01:47:57,566
And who placed it?

1263
01:47:57,666 --> 01:48:03,357
The Vestal virgin, untainted by the crass
self-interest of her senate counterparts,

1264
01:48:04,255 --> 01:48:07,051
- or a girl with a crush on a prince?
- How dare you!

1265
01:48:07,151 --> 01:48:10,245
Yield a public retraction, denounce Octavius...

1266
01:48:13,241 --> 01:48:16,237
or I will make this temple shake.

1267
01:48:33,310 --> 01:48:35,307
Senator Cassius, this way.

1268
01:48:45,291 --> 01:48:46,890
I kept him back here, senator.

1269
01:49:29,721 --> 01:49:30,720
Tyrannus.

1270
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:47,593
Well, are the accommodations to your liking?

1271
01:49:48,293 --> 01:49:49,290
Could be better.

1272
01:49:49,990 --> 01:49:51,088
Or much worse.

1273
01:49:52,287 --> 01:49:54,382
If any harm comes to me, Cassius,

1274
01:49:54,783 --> 01:49:56,880
the fourth legion will never back you.

1275
01:49:57,478 --> 01:50:01,671
Which is why, despite whatever bickering
has kept us squabbling in the past,

1276
01:50:01,872 --> 01:50:04,767
today we have no choice but each other.

1277
01:50:04,967 --> 01:50:08,162
See, a lawless dictator,
whether Anthony or Octavius,

1278
01:50:08,261 --> 01:50:12,156
only enrich themselves and threaten
the landowners -- us.

1279
01:50:12,853 --> 01:50:15,250
Are we wrong to protect ourselves?

1280
01:50:18,831 --> 01:50:20,327
I want that legion.

1281
01:50:22,025 --> 01:50:27,117
Killing Caesar could have re-established the senate
as the true ruling force in Rome

1282
01:50:27,516 --> 01:50:30,013
if the right man had been holding the knife.

1283
01:50:31,012 --> 01:50:33,807
Instead, the senate got Cassius.

1284
01:50:34,505 --> 01:50:36,703
The other senators laughed at your dinner invitations,

1285
01:50:36,802 --> 01:50:39,598
and now you think they'll follow you to the servian walls?

1286
01:50:40,097 --> 01:50:41,794
You're a eunuch, Cassius.

1287
01:50:42,792 --> 01:50:45,389
And since harming me would threaten your interests,

1288
01:50:45,424 --> 01:50:47,685
I can follow my heart instead of my head.

1289
01:50:50,680 --> 01:50:53,276
I'll throw my lot in with the boy.

1290
01:51:16,839 --> 01:51:18,437
Cut him to pieces.

1291
01:52:15,073 --> 01:52:17,868
Tell them who I am. Save yourself.

1292
01:52:19,768 --> 01:52:21,560
I would have followed you.

1293
01:53:00,001 --> 01:53:02,098
Hail, Caesar.

1294
01:53:22,865 --> 01:53:25,262
For a general, he wasn't much of a strategist.

1295
01:53:25,462 --> 01:53:26,859
I'll have his legion for the senate,

1296
01:53:26,959 --> 01:53:29,955
and for the anguish he caused me,
this estate for myself.

1297
01:53:30,754 --> 01:53:32,151
I'll alert my gardener.

1298
01:53:32,251 --> 01:53:33,749
Tell him what you told me.

1299
01:53:33,849 --> 01:53:36,145
We arrested Magonius here with two slaves.

1300
01:53:36,245 --> 01:53:38,241
They arrived on horseback, one a boy.

1301
01:53:38,276 --> 01:53:40,432
Slaves on horseback?

1302
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:46,187
Oh, of course.

1303
01:53:47,147 --> 01:53:49,545
Octavius and the gladiator.

1304
01:53:50,504 --> 01:53:52,999
This would be their first stop.

1305
01:53:53,095 --> 01:53:54,149
Assemble the men.

1306
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:55,780
We're going back to Arkham.

1307
01:54:05,852 --> 01:54:07,536
Hail, Octavius Caesar,

1308
01:54:18,967 --> 01:54:20,808
Freedom, at the very least, I'd say,

1309
01:54:20,910 --> 01:54:24,790
though I think a few hectares of land
might be in order as well.

1310
01:54:30,045 --> 01:54:30,743
Don't bother.

1311
01:54:30,778 --> 01:54:34,590
You rich boys fold up and die in here

1312
01:54:45,846 --> 01:54:48,654
Your troubles will be over soon.

1313
01:55:12,936 --> 01:55:14,414
You won't do it.

1314
01:55:56,625 --> 01:55:57,787
What happened?

1315
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:02,391
The chieftain --

1316
01:56:04,927 --> 01:56:06,617
he discovered my identity.

1317
01:56:06,723 --> 01:56:07,992
Did you hide the body?

1318
01:56:09,364 --> 01:56:10,315
Hmm?

1319
01:56:10,526 --> 01:56:12,218
Octavius, did you hide the body?

1320
01:56:14,459 --> 01:56:16,783
He barely made a sound after I hit him.

1321
01:56:20,128 --> 01:56:21,185
I'm a murderer.

1322
01:56:21,594 --> 01:56:24,423
Murderer, soldier, gladiator --

1323
01:56:24,504 --> 01:56:27,145
what's the difference in the end?
You did what was necessary.

1324
01:56:27,323 --> 01:56:28,379
Listen to me.

1325
01:56:28,696 --> 01:56:33,027
The new Rome that Julius Caesar imagined
before he died is worth protecting,

1326
01:56:33,683 --> 01:56:35,162
and so is his heir.

1327
01:56:37,939 --> 01:56:39,842
At least I've come to believe so.

1328
01:56:46,214 --> 01:56:48,116
Wash the blood off your hands

1329
01:56:48,886 --> 01:56:50,469
and wait for my signal.

1330
01:57:01,685 --> 01:57:03,588
You afraid of a fair fight?

1331
01:57:19,706 --> 01:57:21,844
No, I said a fair fight.

1332
01:58:18,127 --> 01:58:19,876
Tyrannus of Rome.

1333
01:58:21,194 --> 01:58:22,359
It can't be.

1334
01:58:47,112 --> 01:58:48,180
Fight!

1335
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:50,609
Fight!

1336
01:58:52,066 --> 01:58:53,425
Fight!

1337
01:59:18,012 --> 01:59:19,081
What's happening here?

1338
01:59:23,744 --> 01:59:25,397
Find Octavius! That's all that matters!

1339
01:59:29,282 --> 01:59:31,323
There! There's his bodyguard!

1340
01:59:32,779 --> 01:59:33,752
Where is he?

1341
01:59:34,918 --> 01:59:36,083
Where's Octavius?

1342
01:59:36,473 --> 01:59:38,318
Stop, Rapax.

1343
01:59:43,662 --> 01:59:44,925
All right, stop.

1344
01:59:45,216 --> 01:59:46,674
Put down your weapons.

1345
01:59:47,451 --> 01:59:48,617
Stand back!

1346
01:59:51,021 --> 01:59:52,187
Tell them.

1347
01:59:59,377 --> 02:00:00,931
There's two horses behind me.

1348
02:00:01,028 --> 02:00:02,388
Release all the other ones.

1349
02:00:02,873 --> 02:00:03,748
Now!

1350
02:00:08,214 --> 02:00:10,201
I should kill you for what you did to my uncle.

1351
02:00:10,207 --> 02:00:13,424
Oh, do that, by all means.
See how far you get.

1352
02:00:14,731 --> 02:00:16,241
One step at a time.

1353
02:00:18,857 --> 02:00:21,170
You'll never be Caesar!

1354
02:00:40,278 --> 02:00:43,699
Just tell me which senator
accepted the position.

1355
02:00:43,799 --> 02:00:44,806
It's complicated.

1356
02:00:44,906 --> 02:00:47,822
I'm not sure you realize the hesitancy.

1357
02:00:47,923 --> 02:00:48,627
The concern.

1358
02:00:48,727 --> 02:00:50,540
Stripping Mark Anthony of his consulship --

1359
02:00:50,641 --> 02:00:53,555
only a certain type of person would volunteer.

1360
02:00:53,655 --> 02:00:55,769
Who is it, then?
Someone from the outer provinces?

1361
02:00:58,083 --> 02:01:02,104
You couldn't find a senator
who wanted to be consul?

1362
02:01:03,211 --> 02:01:05,022
Please don't tell me it's a mayor.

1363
02:01:05,225 --> 02:01:08,239
The mayors value their lives
as much as the senators, it seems.

1364
02:01:08,846 --> 02:01:14,779
Who am I about to anoint leader
of the Roman republic and Roman army?

1365
02:01:19,302 --> 02:01:22,723
These are the aqueduct commissioners
of the servian wall,

1366
02:01:22,823 --> 02:01:24,536
Herteus and Panza.

1367
02:01:24,637 --> 02:01:26,044
The gods test me.

1368
02:01:30,265 --> 02:01:32,279
By emergency decree of the senate,

1369
02:01:32,379 --> 02:01:36,707
I here by appoint you, Herteus, and you, Panza,

1370
02:01:36,807 --> 02:01:40,221
to be co-consuls of the republic of Rome.

1371
02:01:56,219 --> 02:01:58,426
Don't miss, boy. I'm hungry.

1372
02:02:04,868 --> 02:02:06,975
You do it. I've had my fill of blood.

1373
02:02:31,215 --> 02:02:33,329
Whatever happens now, stay close to me.

1374
02:02:33,429 --> 02:02:34,336
But it's Mark Anthony.

1375
02:02:34,436 --> 02:02:36,349
Just stay close.

1376
02:02:44,292 --> 02:02:45,899
No more running, prince.
