00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:22,524
Yeah, that's right.

161
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:26,564
Order! Now, accordingly...

162
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:29,465
I will impose sentence
at this time.

163
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:32,834
Mr. Kritski, it's within my prerogative
to sentence you...

164
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:35,100
- to one year in the county jail.
- [Crowd Cheers]

165
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:39,077
However...

166
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:42,876
- I'm not going to do that.
- Huh?

167
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:48,114
In my opinion, threats of jail won't move you
to bring your building into compliance.

168
00:11:48,187 --> 00:11:52,749
Therefore, I am sentencing you to house arrest
in one of the apartments of your building...

169
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,953
- [Laughter, Clapping]
- For a period of 120 days...

170
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:58,190
or until the building
is brought up to code...

171
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:00,255
as required
by the State of New York.

172
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:05,066
Your Honor, respectfully, I really think
the maximum sentence is what's needed here.

173
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:08,232
This city must send a message
to slumlords that they can't continue...

174
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:11,640
Miss Bensinger, I believe that this sentence
will bring results.

175
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:14,805
As counsel for the Housing Authority,
I expect you to report...

176
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:18,442
any failure on Mr. Kritski's part to comply
with the directives of this court.

177
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:22,818
Now, according
to the report I ordered...

178
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:27,155
Apartment 5C in your building
is vacant, Mr. Kritski...

179
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:30,218
and is listed by you as a...

180
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:35,131
　Furnished, fifth-floor charmer
with a view, and close to shopping. "

181
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,931
- [Man] what?
- You will move in immediately.

182
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:41,132
You will reside there,
serving as the building superintendent.

183
00:12:41,207 --> 00:12:45,507
You will be allowed to leave only
to purchase food, for medical emergencies...

184
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,910
and for business related
to the repair of the building.

185
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,246
You may not renovate or alter Apartment 5C
to suit your needs...

186
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:55,219
until the rest of the apartments in the building
have been brought into compliance.

187
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:59,622
- [Big Lou] Oh, boy.
- Mr. Kritski, one more thing.

188
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:03,355
If that building isn't
up to code in 120 days...

189
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,489
- you will go to jail.

down at City Hall?

193
00:13:14,107 --> 00:13:16,667
well, you're not. You know why?
Because I'm gonna get a new lawyer.

194
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:18,733
A white judge,
and I'm gonna appeal.

195
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:21,143
- On what grounds?
- On the grounds that you piss me off.

196
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:23,148
[Louie] I thought you said
this lawyer was the best.

197

in his price range. But don't worry.

I'm gonna take you out of the will.

the boiler in the building.

476
00:30:45,123 --> 00:30:47,887
There's nothin' wrong with the boiler
in the building. It's runnin', ain't it?

00:30:52,964 --> 00:30:56,661
Good thing you're here. One more friggin' day,
I'll be ready for the funny farm...

what do you mean?

485
00:31:10,715 --> 00:31:12,842
Eeyew! what is the smell
in this building?

486
00:31:12,918 --> 00:31:14,852
- It smells like...
- Piss.

487
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,616
Yeah! It smells like piss!
what is that?

488
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:20,021
It's piss. Drunks come in the hallway
and they piss.

[Scoffs]
You let them pee in here?

490
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:24,721
It's not like they ask permission.
You know what I'm talkin' about?

491
00:31:24,796 --> 00:31:26,923
- [Screams] It was a rat!
- what?

492
00:31:26,998 --> 00:31:30,399
I saw a huge rat, Louie. I can't do it.
I can't stay in a place where there's rats!

493
00:31:30,468 --> 00:31:33,028
It's not a rat.
You know, it's probably one of those, uh...

494
00:31:33,104 --> 00:31:36,403
those Chihuahuas, they got
those ugly-lookin' dogs, these tenants.

That's all it is.

496
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,408

- Oh, my God!

Make yourself comfortable.
I'll be right there.

501
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:54,916

for us to drink.

- Yes. I picked this up for us.
- what is that?

506
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:10,863
It's wine. They drink it in the neighborhood.
It's supposed to be really good.

You knew the place was a dump.

512
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:29,960
- what's the big deal?
- [Scoffs] what do you want me to do?

513
00:32:30,028 --> 00:32:32,326
You want me to lie there and spread my legs
and try not to throw up...

514
00:32:32,397 --> 00:32:34,865
for as long as it takes you
to get your rocks off?

515

- You actually considering doing that?
- No!

516
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,204
- Come on, just...
- Louie!

517
00:32:40,272 --> 00:32:44,299
Come here. Just, uh, sit down.
Give it a chance.

518
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:49,336
Give it a chance. Give the wine a shot, you know.
Loosen up a little bit.

519
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:52,212
Ah, it's not that bad, see?
It's pretty comfortable, right?

It's not so bad. Except for the smell.

523
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:06,290
It's this place, you know? It's...
It's hard to get in the mood.

524
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:09,663

- Maybe some music!
