know about him?

193

He's a fireman
from Denver.

194
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,737
I thought he was a doctor.

195
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,466
He has a
paramedic license.
He's not a doctor.

My dear Kaden.

207
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:51,995
He's been in your
care for three days

208
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,695
and he's yet to give
you the time of day.

won't break him.

00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,571
It's so fucking cliché!

365
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,579
I should have known
something was up

366
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,379
when she never
asked for a ransom.

367
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,521
She told me
to go to this bar
outside the city.

368
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:37,692
To go alone.

369
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,662
But when I got there,

370
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:44,660
there was no Akiko.

371
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,964
Only that woman.

372
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,968
She's the same woman
that brought you.

373
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,404
Then I woke up here.

374
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,138
How long has it been?

375
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,271
A month.
Six weeks maybe.

376
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,978
When you never see
the sun rise or set,
how do you know?

377
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,290
Why'd they choose you?

378
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,393
Because I trained
with weapons all my life.

379
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,920
Have you fought?

380
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:17,524
Yeah.

381
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,093
It was either him or me.

382
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,963
We're all already
dead anyway.

Why?

387
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,752
It's simple.

388
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,430

389
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,441
You were lucky.
You won't be next time.

390
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:11,943
Why do you care?

391
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:13,982
I can help you.

392
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,285
I don't need your help.

393
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:17,326
Without me,
you'd be dead very soon.

395
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,088
I recruited you.

403
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,850
I am that man
behind the curtain.

404
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:53,986
You're sick.

405
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,325
When I was growing up,
my father used to
stage these brutal,

406
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,624
bare-knuckle
fights in the backyard.

407
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,632
All these assholes
would come over
and drink and gamble

408
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,965
and cheer the winners
and spit on the losers.

409
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,432
Well, in my mind,

410
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:13,498
just watching
those poor fools lose
wasn't enough.

411
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,604
So I've upped the ante,
as it were.

412
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,309
I'm gonna kill you.
You know that?

413
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:26,282
What we have here

414
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:28,790
is a failure
to communicate.

419
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,573
Ah, yes.

420
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:51,407
The paradox.

421
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,850
You won't fight,

422
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,612
but you don't want to die.

423
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,684
But you will die,

424
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,751

You see our dilemma?

426
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,228
I won't fight.
Not for you.

427
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:11,195
Well, who would you
fight for? Your wife?

428

Oh, that's right.
She's dead.

fight for?

00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:27,948
No, no, seriously.
I'll make you a proposition.

You give me,
say, 10 fights.

433

One down, nine to go.

434
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,150
I didn't kill that man.

435
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,750
Horribly mutilated
and left for dead?

436
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:42,093
Knowing he was
going to be killed, huh?
Shades of gray, David.

437
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,824

You really want me
to believe
you'll just let me go?

545
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:19,240
That was astounding!

546
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,717
Kudos to us all.

547
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:27,922
You said he would
fight, Milla,
and fight he did.

548
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:30,648
My money, please.

549
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:39,460
Ladies, will you please
wire Milla's winnings.

550
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,930
Kawaii.

551
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,114
A little something extra.

552
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,784
You've done
exceedingly well, Milla.

553
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:04,047
Your fireman from Denver
may turn out
to be a rainmaker.

554
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,024
DAVID: Hey

555
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:10,559
You.

556
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:13,631
The one behind the curtain.

557
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,435
Yes.

558
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:18,297
I accept your offer.

559
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:22,839
I will give my absolute best
for another eight fights.

560
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,472
On one condition.

561
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,174
And that is?

562
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,682
The last fight,

563
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:33,916
I want him.

564
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:35,545
(LAUGHS)

565
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,226
Those are my terms.

566
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,024
You don't like them,

567
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:43,229
then we're done with
this bullshit right now.

568
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,766
You are not going
to kill yourself.
You're bluffing.

569
00:48:55,666 --> 00:48:57,577
You don't think
I could beat him.

570
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,773
Please, it's a nonissue.

571
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:06,150
No one's ever survived
five contests, let alone 10.

572
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:11,288
People want
to see me fight.

573
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,451
I want to fight.

574
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:16,120
Well?

575
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,525
What's it gonna be?

576
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,995
That's up to you, Kaden.

577
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,770
And what if he wins?

578
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:30,336
You know I'd never
allow that to happen.

579
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,107
We accept your offer,

580
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,347
Death Dealer.

581
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:45,355

(SCREAMS)

583
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,071
They're moving you
into another room.

584
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,774
I'd rather have antibiotics.

585
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,283
I can get you those.

586
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,945
What changed?

587
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,189
You fought.

588
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:18,851
You mean, I won.

589
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:24,324
So what?
Now I'm your prize pig?

590
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,197
How much is your cut

591
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:31,966
of the death of
another innocent life, huh?

592
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,371
Do you want
the antibiotics or not?

593
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,506
Yeah, I want the antibiotics.

594
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,449
And something to sew it up!

595
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,117
(GROANING)

596
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,377
DAVID: Watch the muscle,
watch the muscle.

597
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,620
Right there.

598
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,158
(GRUNTING IN PAIN)

599
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,434
Wider stitches, okay?

600
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,267
Very good.
Pull the skin.

601
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:42,467
Pull the skin.
Pull it tight.

602
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:55,588
(GROANING)

603
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,529
Fuck.

604
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,845
Yeah, yeah.

605
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:48,808
Looks like
you're getting better.

606
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,738
Better enough to fight.

607
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,183
Exactly.

608
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:09,154
Thank you.

609
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:13,563
Really.

(YELLING)

612
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,901
Yeah, we sure do
like a whipping.

613
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:28,958
But nothing

614
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:31,934
like a pussy-whipping.

615
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,430
(DOOR OPENING)

Hey, check this out.

620
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,978
What's up?

621
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,112
Oh, dude.

622
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,211
Yeah.

623
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:03,780
Hell, yeah,
Death Dealer
will be all over him.

624
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,587
You think so?
Definitely.

625
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,683
He's gonna kill him.

626
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:07,819
The Executioner's
big guy.

627
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,820
What'd you do
to your hair?

628
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:14,258
Just trying something
a little different.

629
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,477
(YELLING)

630
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,612
I am David Lord.

LOGAN: (WHOOPING)
Yeah! Yeah!

632
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,657
Oh, my goodness!

633
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:36,227
He is every bit as good
as you were in your prime.

634
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:41,665
You know, just
say the word, partner.

635
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,438
We can call this off.

636
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,399

(CHUCKLING)

638
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:41,095
My name is David Lord.
And in one more fight,
I'm gonna kill you.

639
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:45,433
(YELLING)

640
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,611
That was amazing, my man.

641
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:58,718
Bravo! Bravo!

642
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:07,055
Better watch your back.

643
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:11,258
He may have
found himself
a new favorite.

644
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,639
We've got a situation up here.

645
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:03,279
(EXPLODING)

646
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:41,920
Brutus Jackson,
who terrorized
South Africa 12 months ago

647
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:43,651
by going on
a drug-induced rampage,

648
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:46,623
killing 14 people,
has escaped.

649
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:50,759
Jackson was being transferred
to the death row
facility at Pollsmoor

650
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:53,926
when the transport
carrying him was
brazenly ambushed

651
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:56,299
just outside
the Robben Island Prison gate.

652
01:04:56,926 --> 01:05:00,897
The three guards
escorting Jackson
were found dead at the scene.

653
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:03,409
Local authorities
have no further
information at this time.

654
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:11,344
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

655
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:10,172
I don't see
the problem.

656
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:14,515
The whole universe
is looking for us

657
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:15,851
and you pull
a stunt like this!

658
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,654
You kidnap
a world-famous
serial killer?

659
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:19,918
Spree killer.

660
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,157
You might as well
drop a trail of bread crumbs

661
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:24,926
leading law enforcement
to our door!

662
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:28,491
Come on.
The deadbeats
are boring.

663
01:05:28,557 --> 01:05:30,036
All the mind fucking
in the world

664
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,537
can't help someone
who's physically weak.

665
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:36,266
Listen, and this guy,

666
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:37,834
he is a monster.

667
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:39,808
He is ready
to kill again.

668
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:45,085
Think of the added revenue
when our audience
sees that it's him.

669
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:49,684
No longer will
anyone be able to claim
that our fights aren't real.

670
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:54,025
You're afraid of him.

671
01:05:56,385 --> 01:06:00,299
Yeah, and you will be, too,
once you get up
close and personal.

672
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:03,030
No, no, no, no.
Not the serial killer.

673
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,266
You're afraid of
the fireman.

674
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,140
(CHOKES)

675
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:13,312
You are hurting me!

676
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:17,640
(COUGHING)

677
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,160
What?

678
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:36,134
How did you come
to be their hostage?

679
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,229
That's funny.

680
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:43,510
Let's just say
my family wasn't as
pleasant as they are.

681
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:48,307
Certainly with less reward.

682
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:55,146
Kaden's afraid of you.

683
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:58,458
He brought in
some professional,

684
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,787
some maniac
from South Africa.

685
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:15,237
Come back alive. Please.

686
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:20,678
Just two more
and at least one
of us will be free.

687
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,385
You know they
won't let me live.

688
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,321
I have a brother, Sam.

689
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:37,364
We haven't spoken
since the accident.

690
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,464
I tuned out
everyone I ever loved.

691
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:45,369
He probably doesn't
even know I'm missing.

692
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:47,965
Or that I'll soon be dead.

693
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:50,567
Wish I had been
a better brother.

694
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,708
Now I want closure,
you know?

695
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:44,288
So have you guys
done that whole,
you know,

696
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:46,162
college threesome
thing yet or...
Dude.

697
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:48,395
You're never gonna
believe who
Death Dealer is fighting.

698
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,537
Remember that
South African
serial killer guy?

699
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:51,731
Yeah.
The one who escaped?

700
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,467
Yeah.
Yeah. Him.

701
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,132
Tonight?
Now.

702
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,370
It was nice meeting you guys.
Have fun.

Kill the man!
Yeah!

706
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:24,235
God damn!

707
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,600
Where'd he go?

708
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:31,874
Kaneko, Kawaii,
can one of you find him?

709
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:41,183
Having a little
bit of fun now,
aren't we? Yeah?

710
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,919
Well, you ain't seen
nothing yet.

God, this is so awesome!

01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:05,036
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

715
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:11,674
Got a lot of fight in ya.

716
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:15,715
It's pointless,
although it's noble.

717
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:28,902
That's nice. Very nice.

718
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,833
Very, very nice.

It's been nice
knowing you.

722
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:42,999
Yeah!
