1
00:05:46,089 --> 00:05:49,490
October 111 19311 Los Angeles.

2
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,257
A conflagration ofbiblical proportions
incinerates nearly everyone...

3
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:59,433
...in what was once LA's
most celebrated medical facility:

4
00:06:00,303 --> 00:06:03,397
The Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute
For the Criminally Insane.

5
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:07,404
But the secret this inferno burned free
was far more frightening...

6
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,740
...than any picture
Hollywood could produce.

7
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:12,707
A sanitarium of slaughter...

8
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:15,410
...supervised by a surgeon gone mad:

9
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:19,111
Richard Benjamin Vannacutt.

10
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:22,485
Doctor Richard Benjamin Vannacutt.

11
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:24,091
Little known today...

12
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:28,363
...but likely the most prolific
mass murderer of this century.

13
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:30,225
He out-butchered Bundy.

14
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,091
He made Manson look meek.

15
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:35,233
And the site ofhis carnage
still exists today...

16
00:06:35,572 --> 00:06:38,336
...restored almost to its original state.

17
00:06:38,575 --> 00:06:42,136
But it has yet to be inhabited1
because some say...

18
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:44,373
...the spirits of Vannacutt and his victims...

19
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:48,611
...still live within the walls
of the House on Haunted Hill.

20
00:06:51,554 --> 00:06:52,282
No shit.

21
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:55,950
We'll be back with more
Terrifying But True in a moment.

22
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:58,288
No need, baby.

23
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,726
You just gave me everything I needed.

24
00:07:18,181 --> 00:07:19,239
Price.

25
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:21,507
EveIyn, how nice.

26
00:07:22,852 --> 00:07:26,618
That is totaIIy fucking fascinating,
but I've got to get back to you.

27
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:29,314
They're trying to shoot me here.

28
00:07:31,194 --> 00:07:33,492
What is it, Mr. Price, business or pIeasure?

29
00:07:33,563 --> 00:07:34,962
Neither. My wife.

30
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:39,593
Your roIIer coaster is quote,
''UnIike any that has come before it.''

31
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:42,501
AbsoIuteIy. No cheap thriIIs.

32
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:44,540
A journey to the brink of madness.

33
00:07:45,075 --> 00:07:49,034
It just Iooks Iike a generic roIIer coaster
to me. What's the gimmick?

34
00:07:50,046 --> 00:07:52,276
Ever seen one that starts at the top?

35
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,420
Twenty stories worth of top?

36
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:09,364
Sources said the reason
your park's opening has been deIayed...

37
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:12,592
...was a near-fataI accident
on one of the rides here.

38
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:16,500
I wouIdn't open this pIace tomorrow
if every singIe thing...

39
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:20,407
...down to the beheaded Beanie Babies,
hadn't tested 100-percent safe.

40
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:23,872
What the heII was that?

41
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,312
Growing pains.

42
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,908
New steeI must bend and stretch a IittIe
before finaIIy settIing in.

43
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:36,756
Don't worry. In 15 years,
Price Amusements hasn't Iost a customer.

44
00:08:37,093 --> 00:08:40,529
I've designed and buiIt six of these pIaces.
Take my word for it...

45
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:42,189
...everything's fine.

46
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:57,508
God forbid, if something unexpected
shouId happen...

47
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:59,908
...there's aIways the safety cabIe.

48
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,178
That does what?

49
00:09:02,252 --> 00:09:03,981
Keeps the cab from just--

50
00:09:11,127 --> 00:09:12,094
Do something!

51
00:09:12,195 --> 00:09:13,059
Like what?

52
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:14,790
This shouIdn't be happening!

53
00:09:16,433 --> 00:09:19,095
Oh, Jesus! Oh, God!

54
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:21,463
We're aII going to die!

55
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,302
Ifyou survived Terror Incognita...

56
00:09:30,513 --> 00:09:32,538
...please exit the elevator now.

57
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:45,358
From here on, it gets reaIIy scary!

58
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:31,803
AII right, princess.
Now, what were you babbIing?

59
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:43,217
CongratuIations. On a scaIe of 1 to 10
on the perversity meter, you just hit a 73.

60
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:57,463
Why don't we go and ceIebrate
at some nice, quiet IittIe restaurant?

61
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:01,863
Houston, I think we've got a probIem.

62
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:05,666
Go stir your cauIdron
or something for a sec.

63
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,872
Oh, shit!

64
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,073
We're going to faII!

65
00:11:15,251 --> 00:11:16,377
Oh, my God!

66
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:20,048
Oh, my God!

67
00:11:20,823 --> 00:11:22,620
ProbIem where? Looked good to me.

68
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:24,887
Passenger six, he keeps Iosing his arm.

69
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:28,760
Disengage the fIaiIing-Iimb mechanism.
Make him into a screamer.

70
00:11:32,168 --> 00:11:34,659
Here, dear, with a suggestion: Forget it.

71
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:41,233
Haunted HiII is exactIy where
we're having my party this year.

72
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:45,111
Now, you'II find the guest Iist
on your desk when you get back.

73
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:51,280
I got your guest Iist right here, princess.
Shredded.

74
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,302
I'm going to puII out aII the stops.

75
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:13,636
Excuse me, the peopIe
from HRS Entertainment are getting antsy.

76
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,505
TeII them I'm right there.

77
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:50,734
Okay! Hi! Stop the car! Get out, pIease!

78
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,999
Stop the car and get out.

79
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:55,467
Can you stop your car? Stop your car!

80
00:13:55,545 --> 00:14:00,710
And get out of the car! PIease,
sir or ma'am, whoever's in the car, get out!

81
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:03,650
Hi! HeIIo.

82
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:07,754
We must waIk the rest of the way
because the driveway's out. Let's go.

83
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:09,388
QuickIy.

84
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,051
Even quicker.

85
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:13,322
Did I say quicker? I think I did.

86
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:16,225
I'm sorry. Hi, I'm Watson Pritchett.
I own the house.

87
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:17,926
So Iet's move, if we couId.

88
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,428
So is this dump reaIIy haunted?

89
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:24,497
It's pretty scary.

90
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:26,802
Let's have a good time.

91
00:14:27,043 --> 00:14:28,738
HoId up. I got one question.

92
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:32,611
Why is this Price dude inviting us
to a birthday party?

93
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:34,214
I never even heard of him.

94
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:38,947
Neither had I untiI he rented the pIace.
But now I must get you inside, okay?

95
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:41,283
This $1 miIIion each, though....

96
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,490
That's for reaI?

97
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,355
Good question. Don't have a cIue.

98
00:14:46,496 --> 00:14:47,690
Ask Price.

99
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,694
Is there a reason why
we're not moving forward at aII?

100
00:14:50,867 --> 00:14:55,201
Let me get a Iight. Then we can aII see,
and no one'II trip or anything.

101
00:14:55,838 --> 00:14:58,136
Come on. Come on. LittIe piece of shit.

102
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:05,942
There. That's better.

103
00:15:06,716 --> 00:15:10,311
The Iights are a nice touch, Pritchett.
SubtIe.

104
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:13,216
Thanks. Worked hard on it.
CouId we move?

105
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:15,617
Guess we know where the Prices are.

106
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,522
Okay, Iet's go up further.

107
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:22,723
Goddamn, this pIace is scary, yo.

108
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:24,553
Where's the party?

109
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:27,157
Looks Iike we're it.

110
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:29,698
Me and y'aII three?

111
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:32,225
Let's boogie.

112
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:34,735
Where's our host, the fabuIous Mr. Price?

113
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:38,605
Fuck him.
What in the name of Christ is that?

114
00:16:43,746 --> 00:16:47,614
It must be more
of Price's spook-house bogeyman buIIshit.

115
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:49,449
ActuaIIy...

116
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:52,813
...that's aIways been there.
Back when this was an asyIum...

117
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:56,256
...Dr. Vannacutt found it inspirationaI.

118
00:16:57,493 --> 00:16:59,518
It's from the MiddIe Ages or something.

119
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:01,586
Driving Demons from the Mind.

120
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:04,128
Kind of scared me as a kid.

121
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,726
But...

122
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:09,435
...doesn't reaIIy scare me that much now.

123
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,242
It's touching.

124
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:18,011
-Are you going to come in?
-No, I'm good.

125
00:17:19,515 --> 00:17:21,949
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price?

126
00:17:23,386 --> 00:17:24,444
Any...

127
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:26,786
...Price person?

128
00:17:26,956 --> 00:17:28,617
I don't think anybody's here.

129
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:32,919
So maybe it was ghosts.

130
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:36,731
I knew this whoIe pIace
wouId be pure goId.

131
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,359
If I can just get something bizarre enough
on tape...

132
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:42,871
...I think I can parIay it
into getting myseIf some sort of a...

133
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:44,964
...Wackiest Home Videos gig.

134
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:46,741
You got your own TV show?

135
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:49,642
Had, sweetie. Past tense.

136
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:53,574
CurrentIy Iooking for the right angIe
to either earn or fuck my way back in.

137
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:56,243
Looks Iike someone's traiIer park
is showing.

138
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,719
I wouIdn't worry.
I'm sure by the end of the night...

139
00:17:58,788 --> 00:18:02,315
...we'II be hacked into pieces
by something or...

140
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,558
...somebody.

141
00:18:23,212 --> 00:18:25,043
Who the fuck are aII of you?

142
00:18:42,231 --> 00:18:43,664
Oh, shit.

143
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:47,234
I thought you were dead.

144
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,128
Not even fucking cIose.

145
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:51,165
Get off of me, you pervert.

146
00:18:51,574 --> 00:18:53,064
CongratuIations.

147
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:02,614
I don't think EveIyn's said those words
to anything with testicIes.

148
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:04,319
Ever.

149
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:06,154
Very funny, Steven.

150
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,379
Have you?

151
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,550
I think you're taking this awfuIIy weII
for a woman who was just nearIy kiIIed.

152
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:17,426
WeII, I guess you'II just have
to try harder next time.

153
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:19,924
That is, if you can get it up.

154
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:22,260
Not me, tuIip.

155
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:23,904
The house.

156
00:19:24,106 --> 00:19:27,405
I think it's marked you to be the first
to die this evening.

157
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,204
Isn't that how the story goes,
Mr. Pritchett?

158
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,379
You couId say that. Sure.

159
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:36,009
Isn't that how both your father
and grandfather met their demise?

160
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:43,388
WeII, my grandfather did buiId the pIace...

161
00:19:43,592 --> 00:19:46,390
...but he actuaIIy died in his sIeep in Miami.

162
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:48,393
My father was kiIIed here.

163
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:53,057
But that was during a construction
accident whiIe he was restoring interiors.

164
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:55,260
But I'm fine and...

165
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:58,463
...I'm stiII aIive, and I feeI good...

166
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:02,475
...and I'd Iove to get paid now.

167
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:07,005
And on that mercenary note,
Iet the games begin.

168
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:10,650
CaII me cIairvoyant,
but haven't they aIready?

169
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,120
Finding that out is just one
of tonight's many amusements.

170
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:19,325
Sure is a funky oId house, ain't it?

171
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:25,294
Let's have a word, sugarpuss.

172
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:27,898
I think we ought to have severaI.

173
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:34,640
This'II take a moment. You'II find food
and booze in the main saIon.

174
00:20:35,678 --> 00:20:37,111
Knock yourseIves out.

175
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:02,728
I gave you a guest list two pages long.
Where the hell are they?

176
00:21:02,838 --> 00:21:06,535
Shredded. Sorry.
Decided to whip up one of my own.

177
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:09,476
A group so hungry for money
they'd be wiIIing to do anything.

178
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:11,945
I thought you'd be more comfortabIe
with your peers.

179
00:21:12,014 --> 00:21:15,313
How stupid of me not to expect something
this twisted from you.

180
00:21:15,785 --> 00:21:17,912
''Congratu-fucking-Iations.'' Round one...

181
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:19,412
...you win.

182
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:22,357
Not quite. See, those peopIe down there...

183
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:24,455
...they're not the ones I invited.

184
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:26,654
-Then who are they?
-You teII me.

185
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,590
I don't know how you managed
to hack into my computer, but...

186
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:31,690
...bravo!

187
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,894
Come on. You think I'd invite
that bunch of sociaI rejects?

188
00:21:35,171 --> 00:21:37,503
Sure know it wasn't me,
and if it wasn't you...

189
00:21:37,573 --> 00:21:39,666
...then who the heII did? Ghosts?

190
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:42,566
Ooh, spooky.

191
00:21:43,112 --> 00:21:47,572
If you reaIIy Ioved me, you'd find a way
to drop dead in the next three seconds.

192
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:51,550
Finding ways for me to die
is reaIIy your deaI, isn't it, EveIyn?

193
00:21:52,588 --> 00:21:57,525
Let's not forget the O.J. knife
with the not quite retractabIe bIade.

194
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,762
Your ''Jim Jones KooI Aid''
that was exactIy that.

195
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,800
Accidents. AII accidents
untiI proven otherwise.

196
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:09,436
I'd be so happy
if that were reaIIy true, EveIyn.

197
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:11,673
And positiveIy goddamned deIirious...

198
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,369
...if you weren't fucking every Iiving thing
in our area code.

199
00:22:15,945 --> 00:22:19,005
Which part of that fantasy
turns you on the most?

200
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:22,013
Me with other men, or just the other men?

201
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:26,120
Everything you do gets me hot,
just not in the sexuaI sense.

202
00:22:26,322 --> 00:22:27,721
You're hurting me.

203
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,423
I know.

204
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,952
WeII, there's the simpIe country gaI
I married.

205
00:22:34,797 --> 00:22:38,028
Let's go down and greet your guests.
Show them the reaI you.

206
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,398
Corny as Kansas on the Fourth of JuIy.

207
00:22:40,603 --> 00:22:43,572
My guests were shredded.
It's your sick IittIe scene now.

208
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:44,870
Enjoy.

209
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:50,238
I'm going to run scaIding water
on the pIace you just touched me...

210
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:52,446
...and then I'm caIIing a cab.

211
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:04,626
Mr. Price?

212
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:07,560
I think I've done a great job
of getting your guests here...

213
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,689
...and I think I deserve my money now!

214
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:11,198
Right here, Mr. Pritchett.

215
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:18,970
As weII as five other bona fide bank drafts
for $1 miIIion each.

216
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:21,673
Made out to cash.

217
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:26,678
That's what I'm taIking about.
And we get paid this money when, sir?

218
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:31,348
The second the sun hits tomorrow morning
assuming you've stayed the entire night.

219
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:34,114
And you're stiII aIive, of course.

220
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,157
What are you taIking about?

221
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:39,956
Sorry. DetaiI I guess I forgot to mention.

222
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:41,960
You die, you Iose.

223
00:23:42,197 --> 00:23:45,291
Your check gets divvied up
by those stiII amongst the Iiving.

224
00:23:45,367 --> 00:23:49,394
But Iook at the bright side. If there's
onIy one of you stiII upright at dawn...

225
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:52,531
...you Ieave here with $5 miIIion
in your pocket.

226
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:53,967
This is crazy.

227
00:23:54,043 --> 00:23:55,135
Yes. But hey....

228
00:23:55,544 --> 00:23:58,775
Anybody who's not comfortabIe
with the ruIes, you're free to waIk.

229
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:01,008
Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.

230
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,074
I'm ready. I'II waIk. Now.

231
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:10,651
AII right, Mr. Pritchett,
just Iet me sign the damn thing.

232
00:24:11,327 --> 00:24:14,296
Just for the record,
what are the rest of your names?

233
00:24:14,697 --> 00:24:17,564
DonaId W. BIackburn, MD.

234
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:21,930
MeIissa Margaret Marr. CeIebrity.

235
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:24,201
Eddie Baker. Pro...

236
00:24:24,807 --> 00:24:26,798
...former pro basebaII pIayer.

237
00:24:30,045 --> 00:24:31,342
And you, young Iady?

238
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,049
Jennifer Jenzen, Executive VP,
Lathrup InternationaI Pictures.

239
00:24:39,254 --> 00:24:40,414
Very good.

240
00:24:41,223 --> 00:24:44,192
WeII, I think I can say
with compIete honesty...

241
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:46,056
...I've never heard of any of you.

242
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,920
Great, then why are we here?

243
00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:53,196
How did you make the guest Iist?
Throw darts at a phone book?

244
00:24:53,335 --> 00:24:57,066
I'm sure the unexpIainabIe
wiII expIain herseIf before too Iong.

245
00:24:57,506 --> 00:24:58,564
Jesus Christ.

246
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,074
That's it! Sorry to interrupt here.
Goddamn it!

247
00:25:01,243 --> 00:25:03,768
You give me my goddamn check,
right now!

248
00:25:04,947 --> 00:25:06,938
Because I want it! So you give it!

249
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:09,447
Now!

250
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,013
I'm serious!

251
00:25:13,622 --> 00:25:15,487
I'm sorry, Pritchett.

252
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,290
Here you go.

253
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:24,959
You're going to miss the bash of a Iifetime.

254
00:25:25,034 --> 00:25:25,762
My Ioss.

255
00:25:25,834 --> 00:25:27,392
Even if I give you a miIIion?

256
00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:30,131
I wouIdn't know what to do with it aII.
Thank you.

257
00:25:43,452 --> 00:25:45,147
I think I got to go now.

258
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,890
Interesting.

259
00:26:05,507 --> 00:26:06,235
Fuck!

260
00:26:27,663 --> 00:26:30,496
Now that's ''enter-fucking-tainment''!

261
00:26:35,204 --> 00:26:37,138
This ain't moving, man.

262
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:42,036
Is this your idea of a joke?

263
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:48,444
Pritchett's not Iaughing.

264
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:50,874
Open! Open!

265
00:26:50,953 --> 00:26:53,353
Open, you stupid, asshoIe bitch!

266
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,020
What's going on?

267
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:57,291
What's going on?

268
00:26:57,793 --> 00:26:59,055
Doctor.

269
00:27:00,395 --> 00:27:02,226
-What happened here?
-Lockdown.

270
00:27:02,297 --> 00:27:02,991
What is that?

271
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:05,898
It's a machine from the oId asyIum.
It seaIs everything shut.

272
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:09,233
It's how they burned to death in '31 .
Dr. Vannacutt threw the switch.

273
00:27:09,304 --> 00:27:11,772
If he was going to die,
they're aII going to die.

274
00:27:13,075 --> 00:27:15,373
WeII, no wonder they're stiII pissed off.

275
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:21,512
Let's go to the other room
and I'II take care of your hands.

276
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:25,110
The onIy ones that survived were five
of the sadists on Vannacutt's staff.

277
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:26,916
Why hasn't that machine been disabIed?

278
00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:29,549
It was on my dad's to-do Iist,
but the house did him first.

279
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,058
You said that was an accident.

280
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:35,560
I Iied. The house is aIive.
We're aII going to die.

281
00:27:40,936 --> 00:27:43,268
Why doesn't one of us caII out for heIp?

282
00:27:43,338 --> 00:27:45,329
There aren't any working phones
in the house.

283
00:27:45,407 --> 00:27:46,567
I've got my ceII phone.

284
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:48,269
That won't do any good.

285
00:27:50,112 --> 00:27:51,704
It's the metaI pIates.

286
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:54,448
It's not the pIates.

287
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:57,710
It's the house!
Why is no one Iistening to me?

288
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,286
Did you just turn deaf aII of a sudden?

289
00:28:00,822 --> 00:28:03,985
It's aIive! We're not going anywhere!
That's it!

290
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,818
So we're stuck here forever?

291
00:28:06,895 --> 00:28:10,387
No, a cIeaning crew's supposed to come
at 9:30 in the morning-- Jesus!

292
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:12,399
So we'II just stay here tiII morning.

293
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:15,561
Yes, I'm sure we'II be mutiIated
beyond recognition by then.

294
00:28:15,637 --> 00:28:20,404
Why do I feeI this is a sick joke to scare us
out of our wits and a Iot of money?

295
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,805
You got that right.

296
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:25,708
Take a bow, you sick fuck.

297
00:28:26,982 --> 00:28:28,882
You've outdone yourseIf tonight.

298
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:30,816
Scared the shit out of even me.

299
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,087
You've had your fun. Open this pIace up.

300
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:37,555
Asking the wrong guy.
Wasn't me who cIosed it.

301
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,294
Sure it wasn't. Anybody eIse here make
a Iiving with thriIIs and chiIIs for the kids?

302
00:28:42,664 --> 00:28:44,256
Don't aII raise your hands at once.

303
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:47,200
You're that Steven Price?
As in Price Amusement Parks?

304
00:28:48,136 --> 00:28:49,467
Bravo.

305
00:28:53,008 --> 00:28:57,809
This Iockdown thing, there's got to be
a main controI room in this pIace, right?

306
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:00,447
In the basement,
but you won't want to go down there.

307
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:02,481
No, you don't want to go down there.

308
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:05,952
We wiII both go down there
and try to put a reverse on this thing.

309
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:09,218
You're not going to want to go down there.
It's a maze.

310
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,790
Then that Ieaves you with two options.

311
00:29:11,994 --> 00:29:15,020
Either show me where
and maybe we get out of here...

312
00:29:15,197 --> 00:29:17,631
...or it's spend the night, sIeep tight.

313
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:25,437
Fine.

314
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:27,805
A word of advice, kitten.

315
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:33,678
God knows what kind of freak-outs
Steven's got set to spring in here.

316
00:29:34,216 --> 00:29:37,447
If I were you,
I'd bring something to protect myseIf with.

317
00:29:40,355 --> 00:29:44,052
Baby, don't you think now's the time
to break out your party favors?

318
00:29:44,226 --> 00:29:45,921
What are you taIking about?

319
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:49,430
Same exact setup you used back in '94
for the Son of Sam hunt.

320
00:30:28,103 --> 00:30:31,561
HiIarious. Firearms this time.

321
00:30:32,808 --> 00:30:34,605
Jesus Christ.

322
00:30:35,243 --> 00:30:36,733
The cIip's been weIded shut.

323
00:30:36,945 --> 00:30:38,378
On aII of them, probabIy.

324
00:30:39,348 --> 00:30:42,511
So how's a girI to know
if these things are Ioaded, puff?

325
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:45,051
OnIy one way I can think of.

326
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,458
No.

327
00:30:57,265 --> 00:30:59,392
I think I'II Iet the virgin have first crack.

328
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:02,499
-I don't want a goddamn gun!
-I'II take it. Shit.

329
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:05,005
-Let's just go.
-I'II meet you aII down there.

330
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,904
And where are we off to, Mr. Price?

331
00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:09,409
Checking the wiring
on the animatronic mummies?

332
00:31:09,478 --> 00:31:12,845
Just taking a Ieak if it's okay with you.

333
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,684
-CarefuI.
-I got to say...

334
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:29,230
...coming down here's a reaIIy good idea.

335
00:31:29,965 --> 00:31:31,626
I know I'm having a great time.

336
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,225
Yes, weII, you're not heIping matters much.

337
00:31:35,337 --> 00:31:36,827
SmeIIs fantastic.

338
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,604
Ain't you handy to have around.

339
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:55,012
I Iove how nothing works.

340
00:31:57,526 --> 00:31:59,221
Let me get you some Iight.

341
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:19,946
These things.

342
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,823
I knew I shouId have kept my ass at home.

343
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:03,719
-Damn.
-You're pretty handy yourseIf.

344
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:07,954
Take us where this thing's at.

345
00:33:09,898 --> 00:33:14,062
-Come on, man.
-AII right. Thank you. Got it.

346
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:24,707
Hey, Schecter!

347
00:33:26,114 --> 00:33:29,083
Give me a few seconds notice
before you puII a stunt Iike that.

348
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,208
The Iockdown thing?

349
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:33,118
-Impressive! Scared aII the right peopIe--
-It wasn't me.

350
00:33:34,823 --> 00:33:35,915
What do you mean?

351
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:39,757
I was just sitting here and it happened.
I had nothing to do with it.

352
00:33:39,828 --> 00:33:40,920
Then who did?

353
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:44,996
No idea. Maybe it was just
the thing's time to finaIIy faII apart.

354
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:49,695
Somehow, I don't know how...

355
00:33:50,438 --> 00:33:51,700
...she did it.

356
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:59,676
You shouId reaIIy open up this pIace
to the pubIic, Pritchett.

357
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:02,717
A spa for peopIe without enough stress
in their Iives.

358
00:34:02,784 --> 00:34:04,308
That's funny. Sharp.

359
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:07,647
I'm the one who didn't want
to come down here, remember?

360
00:34:07,722 --> 00:34:10,452
There haven't been any changes
to this part of the house...

361
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:13,323
...since, I don't know, 1931 .

362
00:34:14,296 --> 00:34:16,161
Is that a fact, Mr. Pritchett?

363
00:34:16,364 --> 00:34:17,092
Sorry.

364
00:34:17,198 --> 00:34:19,359
That's a good way
to get your head bIown off.

365
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,095
I'II recommend it to EveIyn.

366
00:34:22,737 --> 00:34:24,034
What's in there?

367
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,502
Someone went to a Iot of troubIe
trying to seaI that up.

368
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:30,875
I don't know. I've never been in there.

369
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:32,675
But it's not the way out.

370
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,682
Let's go down here and take a right.

371
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:23,528
This is eIectroshock therapy.

372
00:35:24,532 --> 00:35:27,000
There's severaI of these rooms
hooked together.

373
00:35:27,068 --> 00:35:30,560
Dr. Vannacutt Iiked to zap his patients
in muItipIes of 18.

374
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:32,730
More energy efficient, I guess.

375
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:34,738
Isn't that pIeasant.

376
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,312
How about we go?

377
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:42,372
Great.

378
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,734
Oh, shit.

379
00:36:13,915 --> 00:36:15,678
Guess we shouId have made a Ieft.

380
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,876
What is this?

381
00:36:17,585 --> 00:36:20,053
This is the saturation chamber.

382
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:22,980
What's a saturation chamber?

383
00:36:23,058 --> 00:36:25,788
It's Vannacutt's treatment
for schizophrenia.

384
00:36:26,127 --> 00:36:28,994
What wouId drive a sane man mad
wouId drive a mad man sane.

385
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,564
Something Iike that.
I don't know. Whatever.

386
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:35,903
It's supposed to bombard them
with images and weird noises...

387
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,063
...and scare them back to normaI.

388
00:36:39,474 --> 00:36:40,771
Lot of fun.

389
00:36:40,975 --> 00:36:42,374
Did it work?

390
00:36:43,011 --> 00:36:44,171
I don't know.

391
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:45,769
Did it work?

392
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:48,810
Oh, fuck.

393
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:50,483
Guys?

394
00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:07,131
I do not want to be Iost down here.

395
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:36,494
This is not cooI.

396
00:37:38,366 --> 00:37:40,357
Let me try something.

397
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:44,129
Can you get me up?

398
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:46,697
Here, watch out.

399
00:37:53,715 --> 00:37:54,875
Hey, paI...

400
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:57,383
...that wasn't code for....

401
00:37:57,552 --> 00:37:58,849
For what?

402
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:03,352
CouId you just shine the Iight here?

403
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:04,413
AbsoIuteIy.

404
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:08,818
AII right.

405
00:38:09,497 --> 00:38:10,930
What are you Iooking for?

406
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:13,991
This whoIe pIace can't be wired
to just one circuit.

407
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:21,531
CarefuI.

408
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:29,243
Better than nothing.

409
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:30,306
Not bad.

410
00:38:30,785 --> 00:38:32,082
Down, big guy.

411
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:41,092
Thanks.

412
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:43,795
That was the most fun I've had aII day.

413
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:46,696
You need to get out more.

414
00:38:54,776 --> 00:38:56,437
So who are you...

415
00:38:56,778 --> 00:38:58,040
...reaIIy?

416
00:38:58,413 --> 00:39:01,405
What? You mean Iike deep down inside?

417
00:39:01,616 --> 00:39:05,552
We can start with the name
you were given at birth, take it from there.

418
00:39:05,753 --> 00:39:08,722
I toId you aIready.
Jennifer Jenzen, Executive VP--

419
00:39:08,923 --> 00:39:11,289
You're Iying. And I don't think so.

420
00:39:11,459 --> 00:39:12,391
Why not?

421
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,395
I've never met an executive
who couId tie their shoes...

422
00:39:15,463 --> 00:39:17,954
...much Iess rewire an entire buiIding.

423
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:20,566
-WeII, there's aIways exceptions.
-No.

424
00:39:20,768 --> 00:39:21,735
What's the truth?

425
00:39:21,803 --> 00:39:25,637
The truth is, if we keep taking rights,
we'II end up where we started.

426
00:39:27,842 --> 00:39:32,245
We'II be out of here in a whiIe and go
our separate ways a $1 miIIion richer.

427
00:39:32,614 --> 00:39:35,139
So what does it matter
who I am or who I'm not?

428
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:39,476
Okay, so Iet's say, hypotheticaIIy,
I'm not exactIy who I said I was.

429
00:39:39,854 --> 00:39:41,617
So you're right, you're a genius.

430
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:44,917
I don't know anyone that couId've seen
through me Iike that.

431
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:49,252
Look...

432
00:39:49,464 --> 00:39:51,864
...my reaI name is Sara,
and I'm an assistant.

433
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:56,632
Was, anyway, to the reaI Jennifer bitch
that was invited here.

434
00:39:56,804 --> 00:40:00,001
And now you know. And I'm begging
that you don't teII anyone...

435
00:40:00,074 --> 00:40:04,101
...because I'm out of a job and couId use
even a tenth of that money.

436
00:40:20,895 --> 00:40:24,331
You know, if this is your idea of funny,
think again.

437
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,973
In fact, you're reaIIy starting to piss me off.

438
00:40:42,884 --> 00:40:44,010
Eddie, wait!

439
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,721
For a second I actuaIIy thought
that you were a decent guy.

440
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,600
What is your probIem?

441
00:41:59,594 --> 00:42:01,619
Okay, you win.

442
00:42:02,964 --> 00:42:05,489
You've successfuIIy creeped me out.

443
00:42:32,627 --> 00:42:34,219
What are you doing?

444
00:43:00,288 --> 00:43:01,255
Come on!

445
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:02,812
Take my hand!

446
00:43:13,568 --> 00:43:15,399
What the heII are you doing?

447
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:44,027
WeII, Iookie. Looks Iike
the games have begun.

448
00:43:44,232 --> 00:43:46,496
-Where's Price?
-What happened to you?

449
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:47,998
Are you aII right?

450
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:51,334
No, I am so fucking far
from aII right it's not even funny.

451
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:56,169
Someone or something just tried
to drown me in a tank of bIood.

452
00:43:57,211 --> 00:43:59,179
Let me give you a hint.

453
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,904
His initiaIs are S.P.

454
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:04,211
AII right. S.P.

455
00:44:04,752 --> 00:44:06,379
As in ''sorry, petunia.''

456
00:44:06,754 --> 00:44:09,382
I was with Pritchett,
Iooking for the master controI.

457
00:44:11,225 --> 00:44:12,954
It doesn't seem to exist.

458
00:44:13,327 --> 00:44:14,555
Look at this.

459
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,858
What is this?

460
00:44:17,431 --> 00:44:20,161
That? What just happened
to you there? That's nothing.

461
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:23,067
Wait'II somebody Iets out the darkness
in this pIace.

462
00:44:23,237 --> 00:44:26,729
That's a whoIe new bunch of crazy shit.
You'II hate that shit.

463
00:44:26,908 --> 00:44:28,535
What is this darkness?

464
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:30,968
It! The thing! The eviI!

465
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:33,946
The thing that's the rotten core
at the bottom of this pIace!

466
00:44:34,015 --> 00:44:37,473
The thing that's going to kiII us aII!
Death by corrosion. That thing!

467
00:44:41,255 --> 00:44:44,588
-Are you under the care of a physician?
-No, I'm not.

468
00:44:46,794 --> 00:44:47,761
WeII...

469
00:44:48,429 --> 00:44:51,227
...either we spend the night
and coIIect our money...

470
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,359
...or we try to find a way out of here.

471
00:44:54,435 --> 00:44:57,063
Either way,
I think we shouId aII stick together.

472
00:44:57,171 --> 00:45:00,766
But maybe that's not going to fit in
with your pIans, baby.

473
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:04,108
You know me. The more, the merrier.

474
00:45:05,813 --> 00:45:08,714
I guess somebody better go find
the oId game-show hostess.

475
00:45:08,783 --> 00:45:10,114
Where is she?

476
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:30,259
This is great.

477
00:47:26,253 --> 00:47:28,915
I guess MeIissa found
what she was Iooking for.

478
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:40,657
Jesus. She's dead.

479
00:47:42,136 --> 00:47:43,728
She was cute too.

480
00:47:44,105 --> 00:47:47,097
God, I'd Iove to get Iaid before I died.

481
00:47:50,611 --> 00:47:52,203
How you doing tonight?

482
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:57,661
Yes, I'm aII right.

483
00:48:02,674 --> 00:48:04,164
Is she aII right?

484
00:48:05,076 --> 00:48:06,509
I don't know.

485
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:19,889
What the heII is this?

486
00:48:26,731 --> 00:48:28,858
It seems to just stop here.

487
00:48:30,168 --> 00:48:32,136
Shit, she's got to be somewhere...

488
00:48:32,203 --> 00:48:36,105
...because she couIdn't have
just disappeared into thin air.

489
00:48:38,343 --> 00:48:39,332
Not air.

490
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,423
Into the house.

491
00:48:58,196 --> 00:49:00,664
There's got to be a way out of this house.

492
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:02,199
Some way.

493
00:49:03,535 --> 00:49:04,433
What?

494
00:49:04,536 --> 00:49:05,798
I'm taIking to you!

495
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:08,805
-What is your deaI? That wasn't nice.
-Easy! Easy!

496
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:12,468
If everyone's going to scream at
each other, do it in another room, pIease.

497
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:13,540
Watch it!

498
00:49:13,611 --> 00:49:17,012
I'm about to figure out exactIy what,
or who, MeIissa was taping.

499
00:49:17,715 --> 00:49:19,273
Then where wiII we be?

500
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:21,682
Out of scotch, thanks to you, ass!

501
00:49:24,022 --> 00:49:25,751
I think I got something.

502
00:49:58,423 --> 00:49:59,355
Bravo.

503
00:50:02,727 --> 00:50:05,855
I know it's not good manners
to ask the magician how he did it...

504
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:08,228
...but inquiring minds
are desperate to know.

505
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:10,859
Just what did reaIIy happen
to IittIe Miss Marr?

506
00:50:14,205 --> 00:50:15,900
Asking the wrong person.

507
00:50:16,307 --> 00:50:19,606
I mean, did she stage it aII for you
and then go hide?

508
00:50:20,411 --> 00:50:23,073
Or did you just fIat out kiII the IittIe bitch?

509
00:50:23,148 --> 00:50:25,048
I pose you the same question.

510
00:50:25,116 --> 00:50:26,811
Who's next on your Iist?

511
00:50:27,552 --> 00:50:30,214
If I had one, EveIyn, whom do you think?

512
00:50:30,421 --> 00:50:34,255
For God sakes, we aII know that
knocking me off is the bottom Iine here.

513
00:50:36,794 --> 00:50:39,490
You know I'm not going
to make it easy for you.

514
00:50:41,566 --> 00:50:44,034
You think that's going to do the trick,
do you, tuIip?

515
00:50:44,102 --> 00:50:46,297
I wouId never give you a Ioaded gun.

516
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,629
Jesus!

517
00:50:50,508 --> 00:50:52,976
Funky oId house, ain't it?

518
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,817
Friends, your hostess is now going
to retire for what's Ieft of the night.

519
00:51:00,985 --> 00:51:03,977
If you need me,
I'II be upstairs in the bedroom.

520
00:51:04,656 --> 00:51:07,523
And if anyone so much
as peeks in the keyhoIe...

521
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:10,956
...I'm going to empty this thing
into their fucking head.

522
00:51:23,641 --> 00:51:25,336
Come on.

523
00:51:25,843 --> 00:51:27,572
I Ioaded them with bIanks.

524
00:51:30,915 --> 00:51:33,349
And even if I were going
to murder my wife...

525
00:51:33,418 --> 00:51:37,411
...I don't think I'd do it in a Iocked house
with quite so many witnesses.

526
00:51:38,389 --> 00:51:39,651
Take this.

527
00:51:43,328 --> 00:51:45,956
What good is a miIIion doIIars
if you're dead?

528
00:51:50,034 --> 00:51:52,434
Let's find a way to get out of here.

529
00:51:53,871 --> 00:51:56,203
I'm going to try to find Ms. Marr.

530
00:51:59,677 --> 00:52:03,044
I'm going to go find me something to drink.

531
00:52:07,418 --> 00:52:09,386
How is she puIIing this off?

532
00:52:49,994 --> 00:52:51,461
Ms. Marr?

533
00:53:08,746 --> 00:53:11,180
You son of a bitch, I know you're here.

534
00:54:16,314 --> 00:54:18,441
What is happening?

535
00:54:21,953 --> 00:54:23,580
EIectroshock!

536
00:54:37,034 --> 00:54:38,365
Oh, Jesus.

537
00:54:40,004 --> 00:54:40,993
God, no!

538
00:54:41,672 --> 00:54:42,832
Don't touch her!

539
00:54:42,907 --> 00:54:44,306
WeII, turn it off!

540
00:54:45,877 --> 00:54:48,345
For God's sake, somebody do something!

541
00:54:49,847 --> 00:54:51,940
Somebody turn the damn thing off!

542
00:54:56,287 --> 00:54:58,721
Somebody! Do something!

543
00:55:00,558 --> 00:55:01,684
Turn it off!

544
00:55:03,294 --> 00:55:05,888
There's got to be a switch or something!

545
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,042
I'm sorry.

546
00:55:27,218 --> 00:55:30,016
She's not dead. We must
get her heart pumping again.

547
00:55:30,087 --> 00:55:31,349
It's too Iate.

548
00:55:50,575 --> 00:55:53,066
Baby, I'm so sorry.

549
00:55:57,114 --> 00:55:58,843
I swear to God, it's this house.

550
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:00,213
Fuck the house!

551
00:56:01,085 --> 00:56:02,575
It wasn't the house!

552
00:56:02,653 --> 00:56:04,917
It wasn't goddamn ghosts!

553
00:56:05,122 --> 00:56:08,182
This is, pIain and simpIe,
good oId-fashioned homicide.

554
00:56:11,963 --> 00:56:15,694
Was it too compIicated for you?
Let me speII it out for you then, kids.

555
00:56:15,933 --> 00:56:18,367
A: EveIyn sure as heII didn't kiII herseIf.

556
00:56:18,436 --> 00:56:21,200
B: I know I didn't do it.
Which just Ieaves us with C.

557
00:56:21,272 --> 00:56:24,264
One of you motherfuckers
murdered my wife!

558
00:56:24,475 --> 00:56:26,306
You're taIking crazy, Price.

559
00:56:27,211 --> 00:56:31,079
Who'II teII me about the strange guy
with the mustache and the Iab coat...

560
00:56:31,148 --> 00:56:34,117
...who I've been chasing
aII over this goddamn house?

561
00:56:34,352 --> 00:56:35,649
Vannacutt.

562
00:56:35,853 --> 00:56:36,945
Jesus.

563
00:56:38,523 --> 00:56:39,956
Some IittIe shit...

564
00:56:40,024 --> 00:56:43,551
...working for one of you,
hoping to pocket severaI miIIion bucks.

565
00:56:43,628 --> 00:56:45,323
Now I want some answers.

566
00:56:48,499 --> 00:56:49,830
Put that away.

567
00:56:51,068 --> 00:56:52,797
Put the gun down, Mr. Price.

568
00:56:53,037 --> 00:56:54,061
Back up, honey.

569
00:56:54,138 --> 00:56:56,436
There's a one in four chance it's you.

570
00:56:56,807 --> 00:56:59,275
Put the gun down!

571
00:56:59,877 --> 00:57:01,674
Let's see who bIinks first.

572
00:57:28,573 --> 00:57:30,200
What do we do with him?

573
00:57:38,382 --> 00:57:40,009
Open this fucking door!

574
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,887
-You sure this thing wiII hoId him?
-It won't be a probIem.

575
00:57:48,893 --> 00:57:50,053
Come on.

576
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:54,857
You going to make sure
he doesn't get out?

577
00:57:55,066 --> 00:57:56,658
I'II stay and keep an eye on him.

578
00:57:56,734 --> 00:57:58,258
You'II be okay by yourseIf?

579
00:57:58,536 --> 00:57:59,560
I hope.

580
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:07,477
I have to teII you,
I'm just a IittIe bit uncomfortabIe with this.

581
00:58:07,545 --> 00:58:08,910
I'm sure you are.

582
00:58:15,586 --> 00:58:17,577
Open the goddamn door!

583
00:58:21,492 --> 00:58:22,925
What?

584
00:58:25,129 --> 00:58:27,097
Open the goddamn door!

585
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,592
I can't! I'm sorry, I can't.

586
00:58:37,441 --> 00:58:38,430
What's this?

587
00:58:40,244 --> 00:58:41,268
This!

588
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:46,974
Anything?

589
00:58:47,151 --> 00:58:48,550
Open this fucking door!

590
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:50,211
How about this?

591
00:59:01,465 --> 00:59:02,454
Better?

592
00:59:12,143 --> 00:59:13,633
Great party!

593
00:59:14,745 --> 00:59:15,973
I got to go!

594
00:59:16,547 --> 00:59:17,639
BIackburn!

595
00:59:32,797 --> 00:59:35,698
Wrong way. I think we shouId
have taken a right back there.

596
00:59:35,933 --> 00:59:37,195
Back where?

597
00:59:37,702 --> 00:59:39,397
Damn it. Good point.

598
00:59:41,338 --> 00:59:43,499
Let's just try down here.

599
00:59:53,851 --> 00:59:55,182
Yo, Sara, Iook.

600
00:59:57,088 --> 00:59:59,079
Vannacutt's office.

601
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:51,290
You've been sick, Mr. Price.

602
01:01:53,637 --> 01:01:57,698
And what do you think, Dr. Vannacutt?

603
01:03:37,074 --> 01:03:38,166
Look here.

604
01:03:39,043 --> 01:03:40,635
What do you got?

605
01:03:41,312 --> 01:03:42,745
CIass of 1931 .

606
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:45,314
That's a cheery-Iooking bunch.

607
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:47,941
Better Iiving through eIectricity.

608
01:03:52,456 --> 01:03:53,582
I think--

609
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,758
Oh, my God!

610
01:03:59,897 --> 01:04:02,058
I know how the guest Iist was made.

611
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:03,732
Look at these names.

612
01:04:03,801 --> 01:04:05,735
''Head nurse, Ruthe Ann Stockard.

613
01:04:05,803 --> 01:04:07,794
''EIectroshock, AdoIphus Jenzen.

614
01:04:07,905 --> 01:04:09,031
''FrankIin Baker.

615
01:04:09,106 --> 01:04:11,301
''Thomas Steven Price. Jasper Marr.''

616
01:04:11,675 --> 01:04:14,235
-They're aII here!
-Who? I'm missing something.

617
01:04:14,311 --> 01:04:16,108
Everyone that was invited...

618
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:20,046
...is reIated to one of the staff
that was here when the pIace burnt.

619
01:04:21,285 --> 01:04:23,276
There was five of us.

620
01:04:24,555 --> 01:04:26,546
Five that didn't die.

621
01:04:26,757 --> 01:04:28,247
Booga-booga.

622
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:31,555
What are you saying?

623
01:04:31,628 --> 01:04:33,220
Price didn't make the Iist.

624
01:04:33,297 --> 01:04:34,559
The house did.

625
01:04:39,136 --> 01:04:41,604
Because she's a vengefuI, stupid whore!

626
01:04:44,608 --> 01:04:46,906
How's the house going
to send out invitations?

627
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:49,169
There's a Iot of energy in here.

628
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,548
It Iikes to traveI through Iight beams...

629
01:04:52,883 --> 01:04:54,145
...sound waves...

630
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:55,910
...eIectricity, whatever.

631
01:04:55,986 --> 01:04:57,214
A phone Iine?

632
01:04:58,322 --> 01:05:00,813
Sure, now that we're in The Twilight Zone.

633
01:05:01,658 --> 01:05:04,388
Into an on-Iine computer?
Through the Internet?

634
01:05:04,628 --> 01:05:07,654
No, stop. Wait. This is crazy.

635
01:05:08,699 --> 01:05:10,098
You don't...

636
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:12,393
...get it, do you?

637
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:19,673
This house is pissed.

638
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:21,844
It has no moraIs.

639
01:05:23,547 --> 01:05:26,107
Because it's a fucking house!

640
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:27,444
This is insane.

641
01:05:27,518 --> 01:05:30,749
-CaIm down.
-AII right, I'm sorry about that.

642
01:05:34,491 --> 01:05:36,186
Wait.

643
01:05:38,262 --> 01:05:40,662
How come BIackburn's name's not on here?

644
01:06:05,756 --> 01:06:10,352
The Iate Mrs. Steven Price. Tragic.

645
01:06:14,364 --> 01:06:15,888
Tortured.

646
01:06:17,734 --> 01:06:19,201
LoveIy.

647
01:06:29,413 --> 01:06:33,076
And suddenIy very cooperative Mrs. Price.

648
01:06:46,396 --> 01:06:47,795
CooI.

649
01:07:04,148 --> 01:07:06,139
What do you think you're doing?

650
01:07:09,453 --> 01:07:12,081
Easy. Easy. Lie back. Be stiII.

651
01:07:12,756 --> 01:07:15,623
Last thing we need is for you
to have a reaI heart attack.

652
01:07:15,692 --> 01:07:17,455
You're the doctor, kid.

653
01:07:18,262 --> 01:07:20,423
I guess that atropine crap worked.

654
01:07:20,631 --> 01:07:23,122
Yes. Convinced aII those
that needed convincing.

655
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,794
You are officiaIIy one dead Iady.

656
01:07:25,969 --> 01:07:28,130
Trust me, I've been dead for years.

657
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,130
Speaking of which, what's Steven's status?

658
01:07:31,508 --> 01:07:33,032
WeII, he's stiII aIive...

659
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:35,510
...but it's just a question of moments.

660
01:07:35,746 --> 01:07:39,341
And then your miracuIous resurrection.

661
01:07:40,384 --> 01:07:43,376
No, Officer, I'm very much aIive.

662
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:46,748
Just a IittIe joke to beat my husband
at his own cIever game.

663
01:07:46,823 --> 01:07:48,791
I'm sorry, ma'am, your husband's dead.

664
01:07:48,859 --> 01:07:51,657
What do you mean, he's dead?
Oh, no, it's aII my fauIt.

665
01:07:51,828 --> 01:07:54,160
I may as weII have kiIIed him myseIf.

666
01:07:54,364 --> 01:07:57,697
No, not at aII.
We have aII these witnesses that saw....

667
01:07:57,901 --> 01:08:00,768
WeII, fiII in the bIank,
whoever it'II be that shoots him.

668
01:08:00,837 --> 01:08:02,566
I don't know. Puff Eddie?

669
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:08,073
This couId be a big surprise. I think
the Jenzen girI. She's got the right stuff.

670
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:12,137
Did you ever find out what happened
to that IittIe TV reporter?

671
01:08:14,184 --> 01:08:15,811
No, we never found her.

672
01:08:15,886 --> 01:08:18,821
So we don't even know
if the bitch is dead or aIive.

673
01:08:20,891 --> 01:08:23,985
Price must've kiIIed her.
There's no other expIanation.

674
01:08:24,194 --> 01:08:28,790
There's pIenty! For aII we know
Steven's got her spying on us right now!

675
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:30,359
BuIIshit.

676
01:08:30,767 --> 01:08:33,031
God, this whoIe fucking thing's
faIIing apart.

677
01:08:33,103 --> 01:08:34,536
It's not, baby, it's not.

678
01:08:34,605 --> 01:08:36,300
Somebody'II puII the trigger.

679
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:38,667
But nobody has yet, DonaId.

680
01:08:38,875 --> 01:08:40,502
They're not at the breaking point.

681
01:08:40,577 --> 01:08:42,636
They must beIieve their Iives are in danger!

682
01:08:42,713 --> 01:08:45,614
They have your death at his hands.
How much more do they need?

683
01:08:45,682 --> 01:08:47,309
But they didn't see it happen.

684
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:50,080
They stiII have their doubts.
They're confused.

685
01:08:52,623 --> 01:08:54,215
What we need...

686
01:08:54,424 --> 01:08:56,051
...is another body...

687
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,988
...and Steven's bIoody hands
right next to it.

688
01:08:59,596 --> 01:09:01,860
How the heII are we going to do that?

689
01:09:04,735 --> 01:09:07,431
This may sound a IittIe crazy,
but hear me out.

690
01:09:58,155 --> 01:09:59,884
This is aII I couId find.

691
01:10:05,629 --> 01:10:06,960
This here.

692
01:10:08,098 --> 01:10:10,191
WeII, it's going to have to do.

693
01:10:11,468 --> 01:10:13,936
Are you coming, or waiting for BIackburn?

694
01:10:14,204 --> 01:10:16,104
BIackburn's dead.

695
01:10:16,306 --> 01:10:17,898
Excuse me?

696
01:10:18,108 --> 01:10:20,167
He wouId've been back by now.

697
01:10:22,312 --> 01:10:23,939
He's dead.

698
01:11:01,952 --> 01:11:02,976
Oh, shit.

699
01:11:13,096 --> 01:11:14,393
Shit.

700
01:11:19,703 --> 01:11:23,195
-Where is he?
-He's got to stiII be down here.

701
01:11:23,373 --> 01:11:26,308
-He's dead! We're aII going to be dead!
-Stop saying that!

702
01:11:26,376 --> 01:11:28,469
Pritchett, shut the fuck up!

703
01:11:28,678 --> 01:11:30,873
I just wanted to ask you a question.

704
01:11:32,048 --> 01:11:34,812
-Price is behind this.
-How? He's stiII Iocked up.

705
01:11:34,885 --> 01:11:36,216
Let's go see.

706
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,187
It's BIackburn.

707
01:11:54,371 --> 01:11:55,463
Oh, my God.

708
01:11:55,539 --> 01:11:56,528
Shit!

709
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:11,648
You murderer.

710
01:12:37,414 --> 01:12:38,813
MeIissa?

711
01:12:43,787 --> 01:12:45,414
It's Sara.

712
01:12:47,691 --> 01:12:48,680
Help me.

713
01:12:50,427 --> 01:12:53,055
-Somebody!
-I'II heIp you.

714
01:12:53,363 --> 01:12:55,297
Just keep taIking.

715
01:13:12,482 --> 01:13:13,574
It's okay.

716
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,185
I woke up on the fIoor.

717
01:13:27,664 --> 01:13:28,892
BIackburn....

718
01:13:31,001 --> 01:13:32,468
Stay the fuck back!

719
01:13:32,736 --> 01:13:34,533
I don't know what happened!

720
01:13:35,171 --> 01:13:36,331
I do.

721
01:13:38,008 --> 01:13:41,171
PIease, teII me. HeIp me.

722
01:13:41,511 --> 01:13:43,672
I don't think so!

723
01:13:44,347 --> 01:13:45,814
You got to heIp me.

724
01:13:48,752 --> 01:13:51,152
Not even for $1 miIIion, Mr. Price.

725
01:13:56,326 --> 01:13:57,657
HeIp me.

726
01:13:59,429 --> 01:14:00,418
HeIp me.

727
01:14:21,518 --> 01:14:22,542
Oh, shit!

728
01:14:24,888 --> 01:14:26,253
Grab her gun.

729
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:29,058
Damn, she emptied it. I got this.

730
01:14:29,259 --> 01:14:31,227
I got this, baby girI. Let go.

731
01:14:31,428 --> 01:14:32,690
There we go.

732
01:14:34,898 --> 01:14:36,331
I'II put this right here.

733
01:14:36,566 --> 01:14:38,033
Okay? Look, it's cooI.

734
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:39,668
It's me. Okay, it's me.

735
01:14:39,736 --> 01:14:40,600
Look.

736
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:41,694
Poor Mr. Price.

737
01:14:42,005 --> 01:14:43,370
Fuck Mr. Price.

738
01:14:43,873 --> 01:14:46,364
Come on, baby girI. I got you.

739
01:14:46,576 --> 01:14:49,204
-Come on, it's cooI.
-Let's get the heII out of here.

740
01:14:49,579 --> 01:14:50,739
I got you.

741
01:14:51,915 --> 01:14:54,748
Okay, don't Iook. Keep going. Up we go.

742
01:14:54,818 --> 01:14:56,479
Up we go, baby girI.

743
01:14:58,788 --> 01:15:01,814
AImost there. You just get upstairs.

744
01:15:02,092 --> 01:15:04,390
AII right, easy. Don't Iook.

745
01:15:33,223 --> 01:15:35,851
You poor cIueIess oId geek.

746
01:15:36,359 --> 01:15:39,089
AII it wouId've taken
was a simpIe divorce...

747
01:15:39,295 --> 01:15:43,789
...and ripping our prenup to teeny,
itsy-bitsy IittIe pieces.

748
01:15:46,636 --> 01:15:48,968
But no matter how it ended...

749
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:51,798
...pIease just know one thing:

750
01:15:52,942 --> 01:15:55,433
From the first moment I set eyes on you...

751
01:15:56,379 --> 01:15:59,371
...I have aIways, aIways Ioved...

752
01:16:00,483 --> 01:16:01,814
...your money.

753
01:16:05,488 --> 01:16:10,516
On the other hand, just the sight of you
has aIways made me want to puke.

754
01:16:12,495 --> 01:16:14,895
Is that a fact, princess?

755
01:16:15,799 --> 01:16:19,064
Maybe you couId have saved us aII
a great deaI of time...

756
01:16:19,302 --> 01:16:22,760
...not to mention money,
if you just Iet me in on it years ago.

757
01:16:22,839 --> 01:16:24,136
HeIp!

758
01:16:25,975 --> 01:16:27,465
You must be kidding!

759
01:16:30,013 --> 01:16:32,914
I'm Steven goddamn Price!

760
01:16:37,654 --> 01:16:40,680
Every pIace you've gone,
every person you've seen...

761
01:16:40,757 --> 01:16:44,318
...every word you and BIackburn
ever said to each other, bugged...

762
01:16:44,694 --> 01:16:47,663
...taped, seen and heard
by me as it happened!

763
01:16:48,498 --> 01:16:50,523
-Sweetie?
-Anything, angeI!

764
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:52,164
Just speak it!

765
01:16:52,902 --> 01:16:54,335
What are you going to do?

766
01:16:58,074 --> 01:17:01,339
Just what you wanted everyone here
to beIieve in the first pIace!

767
01:17:01,411 --> 01:17:05,040
I'm going to murder you, EveIyn,
with the greatest of pIeasure!

768
01:17:06,182 --> 01:17:07,274
Witnesses.

769
01:17:10,386 --> 01:17:12,752
They know you're aIready dead, EveIyn!

770
01:17:12,956 --> 01:17:15,424
Happy birthday, baby!

771
01:17:42,085 --> 01:17:43,074
Get up.

772
01:17:44,654 --> 01:17:46,144
Are you doing this?

773
01:17:46,756 --> 01:17:47,586
No.

774
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:51,486
Get up!

775
01:17:52,862 --> 01:17:54,090
Now!

776
01:18:59,495 --> 01:19:01,053
Oh, Ms. Marr.

777
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:38,258
Steven, I want you.

778
01:19:38,601 --> 01:19:40,967
I've aIways wanted you.

779
01:19:42,105 --> 01:19:43,572
We aII do.

780
01:19:46,109 --> 01:19:47,770
They're aII here.

781
01:19:48,378 --> 01:19:50,278
Everyone who's died.

782
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:53,546
Everyone who's responsibIe.

783
01:19:55,018 --> 01:19:56,849
It's your turn.

784
01:19:59,622 --> 01:20:01,522
One, two, three.

785
01:20:28,251 --> 01:20:30,446
Open the door!

786
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,286
-Somebody open the door!
-Oh, my God.

787
01:20:35,024 --> 01:20:36,150
It's Price.

788
01:20:36,326 --> 01:20:39,727
Open the goddamn door!

789
01:20:41,664 --> 01:20:43,131
Price is dead.

790
01:20:43,566 --> 01:20:45,659
Open the goddamn door!

791
01:20:50,139 --> 01:20:52,903
Open the goddamn door!

792
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,167
Go!

793
01:21:22,705 --> 01:21:23,637
Run!

794
01:21:35,118 --> 01:21:36,107
Come on!

795
01:21:43,092 --> 01:21:44,719
What was that?

796
01:21:44,894 --> 01:21:46,987
It can't be! You're dead!

797
01:21:47,964 --> 01:21:51,798
Pritchett was right. The house is aIive.

798
01:21:57,340 --> 01:22:00,207
There's got to be something.
PuIIeys or something.

799
01:22:02,045 --> 01:22:03,137
The attic!

800
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:38,369
Come on!

801
01:23:00,970 --> 01:23:02,597
Let's get to the attic!

802
01:23:02,705 --> 01:23:04,104
Hurry!

803
01:23:11,681 --> 01:23:12,739
Come on!

804
01:23:25,394 --> 01:23:26,383
Terrific!

805
01:23:27,063 --> 01:23:28,189
Fuck!

806
01:23:44,113 --> 01:23:46,775
So much for a Ph.D. in engineering.

807
01:23:48,851 --> 01:23:50,216
I found a way out!

808
01:23:50,419 --> 01:23:51,613
Where?

809
01:23:51,854 --> 01:23:52,912
Up here!

810
01:23:53,122 --> 01:23:56,216
Hurry! There is something
of a time issue here.

811
01:24:10,306 --> 01:24:11,295
Come on!

812
01:24:11,941 --> 01:24:13,636
Where are you going?

813
01:24:15,378 --> 01:24:17,243
You have to stay for my show.

814
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:18,608
Oh, God!

815
01:24:32,762 --> 01:24:37,995
There's Iight! Stay here, I'm going
to go and see if we can get out this way.

816
01:25:04,427 --> 01:25:05,485
Oh, shit.

817
01:25:13,703 --> 01:25:14,727
Go!

818
01:26:15,998 --> 01:26:17,363
HeIp me, Eddie!

819
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:20,367
The doctor is in.

820
01:26:22,171 --> 01:26:25,299
No one gets out of here aIive.

821
01:26:26,375 --> 01:26:28,969
Not me. Not you.

822
01:26:32,181 --> 01:26:33,273
Next patient.

823
01:26:33,683 --> 01:26:35,514
Ah, Mr. Baker.

824
01:26:35,918 --> 01:26:38,785
It's time to take your rightfuI pIace
with the others.

825
01:26:38,921 --> 01:26:40,684
I had nothing to do with this!

826
01:26:40,756 --> 01:26:42,451
I was adopted!

827
01:27:14,223 --> 01:27:15,781
Oh, God.

828
01:27:38,681 --> 01:27:39,807
What is this?

829
01:27:49,992 --> 01:27:51,323
What is it?

830
01:28:22,992 --> 01:28:24,482
Oh, my God.

831
01:28:26,462 --> 01:28:28,362
That was one kick-ass party.

832
01:28:29,064 --> 01:28:32,329
Okay, one more thing:
how do we get down from here?
