00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:04,004
NARRATOR: In the
great city of Paris,

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,440
there stood a
beautiful cathedral.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,710
It was called the
Cathedral de Notre Dame.

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,779
And it was the one place
in Paris in those days

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,848
where a stranger
could come and be

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,352
welcomed as though
he had come home.

7
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,455
This is a tale of
love and honor.

8
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,357
Of deception and evil.

9
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,493
Of judgment and faith.

10
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:31,598
But mostly, it is a
tale of lives made empty

11
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,534
by the fear of others
who may be different.

12
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:45,012
-[gasp]

13
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,414
NARRATOR: And of lives
enriched for being

14
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,950
open to the experience
of the other souls

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,953
with whom we share a world.

16
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,292
[baby noises]

17
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:02,396
[door opening]

18
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,097
[footsteps]

19
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:12,706
-[gasp] Quickly! some water!

20
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:16,443
-Oh, is there a
treatment in mind?

21
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:17,544
Good doctor!

22
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:20,080
How will this poor child
ever swallow those?

23
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,419
-Oh, that was close.

24
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:29,756
Mother was right, I should've
been a shoe salesman.

25
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,893
-But sir, what about the child?

26
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:33,927
Can nothing be done?

27
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:38,665
-Father, miracles
are your department.

28
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:39,633
[baby crying]

29
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,134
-There, there, little one.

30
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,603
Pay no attention to that, that--

31
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,404
-Quack.

32
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,239
-Yes, that quack.

33
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,608
I mean, no, no,
Brother Lebasse, he's,

34
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,744
he's just a misguided eh--

35
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:51,545
-Buffoon!

36
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:52,846
Lout!

37
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,147
Simpleton!

38
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,615
-Please, Brother
Lebasse, remember,

39
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,785
little ears are listening.

40
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,887
He does have ears, doesn't he?

41
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:02,656
-Sorry Father.

42
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,591
Yes, I believe he can hear.

43
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,793
Perhaps this will help.

44
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,861
[ringing bell]

45
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,197
NARRATOR: And so,
into the lives of two

46
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,633
good men, neither
of whom thought

47
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:16,269
they would ever raise a
child, came Quasimodo.

48
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,573
A boy with great physical
deformities, but beloved

49
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:23,477
of the Archdeacon, and
of Brother Lebasse.

50
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,314
As the years passed,
the boy Quasimodo

51
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,050
grew in stature and kindness.

52
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,153
At times he displayed
remarkable talents.

53
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,988
But because of his
grotesque appearance,

54
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,858
he remained a distant
frightening figure

55
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,527
to the people of Paris.

56
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:44,664
Only the Archdeacon and Brother
Lebasse knew him and loved him.

57
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,035
But they had an entire
city to shepherd.

58
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:52,105
In his loneliness,
Quasimodo sought comfort

59
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,907
in the beautiful
music of the bells,

60
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,643
and the silence of an
accepting companionship

61
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,679
of the cathedral gargoyles.

62
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:03,984
For he felt a kinship with
these misshapen figures.

63
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:07,220
Through it all, though
he lived in the midst

64
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,689
of the spiritual center
of his community,

65
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,959
Quasimodo remained a stranger.

66
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,366
Known only in hushed whispers
as the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

67
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:25,806
[music playing]

68
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,684
NARRATOR: As always,
forces of evil

69
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:15,021
seek to turn efforts of virtue
to their own wicked purposes.

70
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,358
Those forces had come to
Notre Dame, that would soon

71
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,529
transform Quasimodo's
life forever.

72
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,531
-It's very simple, Padre.

73
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,833
As High Sheriff of
the city of Paris,

74
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,836
I have a tremendous
burden to bear.

75
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,707
-You have no idea how Frollo
suffers to protect this city.

76
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,642
You can't imagine
what it takes out

77
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,611
of you to give a
thief a good beating.

78
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,214
Why just the other day,
guggre, yes, my Lord?

79
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,116
-You're interrupting, Trelthume.

80
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:47,154
You know how I
abhor rude behavior.

81
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,588
-Sorry, my Lord.

82
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,725
I don't know what
I was thinking.

83
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:52,559
-Hm, yes.

84
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,728
Now, where was I?

85
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,364
-Lord Frollo, I don't
know where you were,

86
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,599
but I do know that
we are very busy.

87
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,767
So if you don't mind--

88
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,802
-Oh, yes.

89
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,470
Now I remember.

90
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,807
It's come to my attention
that although your coffers are

91
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,809
overflowing, the church
is contributing nothing

92
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,112
to the cost of public safety.

93
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:12,913
-What?!

94
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,614
I've never heard of such a--

95
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:16,683
-If you expect the
members of this church

96
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:19,753
to enjoy my protection
as High Sheriff,

97
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,756
you must be prepared to
contribute to my treasury.

98
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,725
I mean, the city treasury.

99
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,328
-I'd say you were
correct the first time.

100
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,564
As for giving the
tithe of God's people

101
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:34,034
to corrupt officials like
yourself for protection,

102
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,969
well, Lord Sheriff,
the faithful are

103
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:39,739
in the very capable hands
of the almighty himself.

104
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,577
-Save your sermons for the
naive rabble, holy man.

105
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,746
I'm here as a
concerned official.

106
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,348
If you choose to
ignore my warning,

107
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,350
then I can't be held
responsible if something

108
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,619
should befall your flock.

109
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,321
Or you.

110
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:55,755
-Have you no shame?

111
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,791
To come in to God's
house, and threaten

112
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,392
his servants for money?

113
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,128
-Oh, really, I suppose
we'll be forced

114
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,532
to sing "Kumbaya" if
we stay any longer.

115
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,468
Come, Trelthume,
there seems to be

116
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,004
no reasoning with
these clergyman.

117
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,639
For now.

118
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,977
Oh, by the way, I've
received several complaints

119
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,045
that you keep some
sort of monster here.

120
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,481
In the bell tower, I'm told.

121
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,884
-You sir, are the only monster
in this church at present!

122
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,520
-Just the same,
you would do well

123
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,357
to keep a careful eye on
your precious bell-ringer.

124
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:32,759
I, nor the people
of the city, share

125
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,495
your love for the grotesque.

126
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,496
We'll be in touch.

127
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,938
-How could someone threaten
sweet Quasimodo, Father?

128
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:48,174
-The Sheriff is capable
of worse, I fear.

129
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:50,477
We must keep watch
and be especially

130
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,978
mindful of dear Quasimodo.

131
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,347
He is so trusting.

132
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,516
-We hardly need to
worry about him today.

133
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,251
It's Fool's Day in
the city, and he'll

134
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:02,289
want to watch the festival from
the safety of the bell tower.

135
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,691
-Have you heard, my friends?

136
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,627
Today is Fool's Day!

137
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:11,798
All the people put on costumes,
and dance and play games,

138
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:14,668
and they're all happy.

139
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,138
I should be very happy to be
part of such a celebration.

140
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,639
Wouldn't you?

141
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,408
Oh, I might upset someone.

142
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:24,244
Lebasse says people don't know
how to react to someone who--

143
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,745
who's different.

144
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,248
That's why they're
frightened of me.

145
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,049
No.

146
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,450
No, no.

147
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,620
It's best for everyone if I stay
up here with you, my friends.

148
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,587
Listen!

149
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,123
They're playing music!

150
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:37,991
Look!

151
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,292
Look!

152
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,493
Now they're dancing.

153
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,529
And what wonderful costumes.

154
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:47,467
You couldn't tell the difference
between a king or a beggar

155
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,936
in such outfits.

156
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:54,140
Why, even I could--
what did you say, me?

157
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,943
Attend the festival in disguise?

158
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:00,814
But, I've never been
out of the cathedral.

159
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,614
I'll do it.

160
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,520
MERCHANT: The finest
masks in all Paris!

161
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,756
Get yours before they're gone!

162
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:13,059
-Yeah, give me
something real spooky.

163
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:16,196
Like that spooky old
hunchback in the bell tower.

164
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:19,466
-Really sir, if it's ugly you're
after, what you're wearing

165
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,368
seems to suit your needs.

166
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:25,972
-Hey, I'm not as think
as you drunk I am.

167
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,643
-That's it, Hercules.

168
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:33,046
Ring the bell, and win a prize.

169
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:34,447
A winner every time.

170
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,824
Nice try, Goliath.

171
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,594
Come back when you grow up.

172
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:51,297
All right, Ladies and Lords,
who wants to ring the bell?

173
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:54,601
-Excuse me, I'd like
to ring the bells.

174
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,369
-Well, lookie here.

175
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,505
The circus is in town.

176
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:01,041
Where's you money, boy?

177
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,976
Stand back, everyone.

178
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,311
Chuckles here is going to
show you all how it's done.

179
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:10,683
That is, if you can lift
the mallet. [laughing]

180
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:14,988
[bell ringing]

181
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,590
-I, I like to ring the bells.

182
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,591
-A winner every time.

183
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,392
Oh.

184
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,229
-Here.

185
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,565
You might like these.

186
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,733
I just like to--

187
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,269
-I know, I know, ring the bells!

188
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,036
OK.

189
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,070
Now beat it!

190
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:41,915
-The outside world is
truly a strange place.

191
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,718
PIERRE: Dear friends, In this
world of strangers and weary

192
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:51,257
travelers, only art, music, and
poetry, and our love for him

193
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:55,728
who gave them to us, only
this can bring us together.

194
00:09:55,728 --> 00:10:00,533
And so, as a poet, I
humbly submit my rhymes

195
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:03,636
for your approval
and enrichment.

196
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:08,608
My first poem is,
"For the Birds,"

197
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,678
the graceful swan
did once appear

198
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:14,581
as something foul
and insincere--

199
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,615
MAN IN CROWD: Are you for real?

200
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,918
-And so, remember
this, I beg, not

201
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:23,089
every bird can
lay, ahem, an egg.

202
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,493
[laughter]

203
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:31,564
-My next poem is called,
"Ode to a Pound of Bacon."

204
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,467
-You stink!

205
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,435
-Ah!

206
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:36,970
-You don't think
people just carry

207
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,171
this stuff around, do you?

208
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,005
-All right.

209
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:39,973
MAN IN CROWD: Get out of here!

210
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,441
-How about my sonnet to sewage?

211
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,147
You're most kind.

212
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,916
They were just offering a
little constructive criticism.

213
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:52,652
-Perhaps, good sir, but
someone might have been hurt.

214
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,788
-By a few rotten vegetables?

215
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,624
-I was referring to your poems.

216
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:58,424
-Oh.

217
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,159
-Ladies and Gentlemen!

218
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,097
We have performed in
the palaces of kings!

219
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:07,400
In the castles of sultans, and--

220
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,603
-Duh, and a jail in Frankfurt.

221
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,437
Ooh!

222
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,872
-Heh, heh, heh.

223
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:17,377
Ahem, indeed my friends, we
have entertained in the greatest

224
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,246
courts in all of
Europe, And today

225
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:24,217
we are here to perform for you.

226
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:28,221
And now, presenting
the most beautiful girl

227
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,057
in Paris, the
enchanting Esmerelda.

228
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,566
-Did heaven ever create
a lovelier vision?

229
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:40,934
-She's-- she's--

230
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:41,734
-Exactly.

231
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,136
[music playing]

232
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:51,678
-(SINGING) Every night before
I sleep, I say a little prayer,

233
00:11:51,678 --> 00:12:02,522
that I can find a better life
than what I'm living here.

234
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:08,928
'Cause there must be
something more than this.

235
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:13,533
It's time I got
a taste of bliss.

236
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:17,870
With fancy clothes to wear,
and ribbons in my hair,

237
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,841
there must be something
more than this.

238
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:26,679
There must be something
more than this.

239
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,516
This sordid life
I wouldn't miss.

240
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:34,921
The company I find would
be much more divine,

241
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:39,292
there must be something
more than this.

242
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:43,663
-There must be something
more than this.

243
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:47,533
-There must be something
more than this.

244
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:52,538
I'd like a handsome boy to kiss.

245
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:56,509
To live in his chalet,
and dance the hours away,

246
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:01,180
there must be something
more than this.

247
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,485
I'm waiting for that day,
when fortune comes my way,

248
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:08,821
there must be something
more, that I'll

249
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,291
keep praying for, there must
be something more than this.

250
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:24,037
[crowd gasps]

251
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:24,837
-It's the hunchback!

252
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,273
The monster in the tower!

253
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,709
[screaming]

254
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,793
-I, I didn't mean to--

255
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:47,760
-Come my friend.

256
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,896
It's my turn to rescue you.

257
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:53,199
-You there, you gypsy trash.

258
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,835
I might have known it
was you behind this riot.

259
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,637
-Who, us?

260
00:13:57,637 --> 00:14:01,474
We're just harmless musicians.

261
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:05,111
hit it boys, and a one,
and a two, and a three.

262
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,816
-Come on.

263
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:14,020
We'll take these
troublemakers to Lord Frollo.

264
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,922
-I don't see anyone coming.

265
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:18,324
It looks like we
gave them the slip.

266
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,194
Well, you certainly know how to
make an impression, my friend.

267
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,130
-You mean I frightened everyone.

268
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,431
I always do.

269
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,500
-I know just how you feel.

270
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,770
You heard my poems.

271
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,538
My friend.

272
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,208
-I'm called Quasimodo.

273
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,778
It means, imperfectly molded.

274
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:43,950
-Quasimodo, as a poet, or should
I say, as a would be poet,

275
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,819
I learned long ago
that men are not always

276
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:47,687
what they appear to be.

277
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:51,023
-That's what the
Archdeacon says.

278
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,226
As well as Brother Lebasse.

279
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,393
-Certainly.

280
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:58,431
For instance, take the
gypsy girl, Esmerelda.

281
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,766
-She was beautiful.

282
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:01,968
And she danced with me.

283
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,136
With me!

284
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,270
-Ah, yes.

285
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,506
I danced with her as well.

286
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,641
And I can tell
you that she's not

287
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,843
what she appears to be either.

288
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:15,114
She's kind, not at all like
those thieves she's with.

289
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,284
I must find a way
to see her again.

290
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,085
-Yes.

291
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,386
We must.

292
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,754
[wolf howling]

293
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,956
-I think this new recipe
will take your mind

294
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,759
off that pesky
priest, Lord Frollo.

295
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,761
It was double coupon
day at the market,

296
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:34,700
so I was able to get an
extra pound of-- pig bowels.

297
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,538
-I suggest you cook up a
plan to acquire the gold

298
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,541
in that cathedral,
my dear advisor,

299
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,477
before I place you on the menu.

300
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,145
-Of course, your Lordship.

301
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,713
I'm working on a plan even now.

302
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,015
[door opening]

303
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,983
-Sorry to disturb
you, Lord Frollo,

304
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,486
but we arrested this
rabble at the festival

305
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,021
for disturbing the peace.

306
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:57,223
And causing a riot.

307
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,358
-Execute them.

308
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,594
You were saying
something about a plan?

309
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:02,895
-Uh, yes.

310
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:05,998
But perhaps you should give
them some sort of hearing,

311
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:07,733
and then execute them.

312
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,605
You know how much
you enjoy watching

313
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:15,875
people beg for their
miserable lives.

314
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,543
-Yes.

315
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,279
Oh, that is nice.

316
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,248
Bring them in.

317
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,750
-Your most gracious
High Majesty,

318
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,188
I am Euphrades, the leader
of this merry musical band.

319
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,958
There has been a
terrible mistake.

320
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,927
-Yeah, and we made it.

321
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,629
-Pipe down, pencil neck.

322
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,265
-Yeah, pipe down.

323
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,167
-That goes for
you too, lard can.

324
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,505
-Well, well.

325
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,174
What sort of
mischief brings such

326
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:51,544
a lovely captive to my castle?

327
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,746
-My name is Esmerelda.

328
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,682
And my crime was dancing.

329
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,751
-I'd like to see that dance.

330
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,554
Lord Sheriff, we're
being falsely accused.

331
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,090
It was a monster
that caused the riot.

332
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,057
A demon!

333
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,292
-Yeah.

334
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,361
He was a hideous beast.

335
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,130
-Duh, he had split ends?

336
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,566
-I'll show you split
ends, pea-brain.

337
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:14,467
-I've heard enough.

338
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,301
Keep the girl.

339
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:17,403
Dispose of the others.

340
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,238
-Please, please, your worship.

341
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,706
You've gotta believe me.

342
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,607
There was a monster.

343
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,676
A freak of some kind.

344
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,411
-Enough, I said!

345
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,981
-My Lord, about my plan,
I think these prisoners

346
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,483
may be of some use.

347
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,817
-What do you mean?

348
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,152
-Don't you see?

349
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,320
A monster?

350
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,388
A freak?

351
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,156
Running about the
courtyard of Notre Dame,

352
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,558
creating panic and fear.

353
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,928
Who does that make you think of?

354
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,562
-My first wife.

355
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,430
-No, no.

356
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,698
It's the hunchback.

357
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:46,933
Don't you see?

358
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:50,002
He's come out into the city,
away from the sanctuary

359
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,738
of the church, and the
protection of the Archdeacon.

360
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,874
-Go on.

361
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:59,445
-If we can capture the hunchback
and charge him with this crime,

362
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,981
the Archdeacon would be
willing to do anything

363
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:06,185
to keep his precious bell
ringer from coming to any harm.

364
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,387
-I've decided to grant
you an opportunity

365
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,823
to redeem yourselves.

366
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,593
-We are yours to
command, oh great one.

367
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,194
-Of course you are.

368
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,496
-I want you to bring me
the monster you spoke of.

369
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:19,298
He is a known
criminal in this city,

370
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,667
who until now has eluded my men.

371
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:25,671
Bring him to me, and I
will grant you amnesty.

372
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,340
And perhaps more.

373
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,177
-But, but your lordship, we
are just simple street players.

374
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:34,513
How can we capture--

375
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:35,948
-That is your concern.

376
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,416
Not mine.

377
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,153
But make no mistake, if you fail
to bring the hunchback to me,

378
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:45,291
you will live just long
enough to regret it.

379
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:50,763
I'll keep the young lady here,
just to enjoy your safe return.

380
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:55,468
Besides, I think such a
pretty little prize will make

381
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,171
a lovely addition
to my trophy room.

382
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,073
[laughing]

383
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,215
PIERRE: Now comes the night.

384
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,317
The star filled sky.

385
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,586
To sing my love a lullaby.

386
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:18,024
A gypsy girl with
twilight tresses,

387
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:22,528
fair Esmerelda, my
heart possesses.

388
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:25,331
-Ha, ha, wonderful, bravo!

389
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,933
You only needed the proper
inspiration, Pierre.

390
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,735
-Do you think so?

391
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,972
I mean, could it be I'm
actually able to capture

392
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:35,674
a part of what I feel in words?

393
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,476
-It's the same with me.

394
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,678
When I ring the bells
of the cathedral.

395
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,646
[bells ringing]

396
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,948
-What's that?

397
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:45,284
-You mean the church bells?

398
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,952
-I've got to go.

399
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,626
-What's wrong, Quasimodo?

400
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:57,797
-Thank you for being
so kind to me, Pierre!

401
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,065
-Be careful, my friend.

402
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:02,802
[church bells]

403
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,737
-Where could he be?

404
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,377
Surely he heard us
ringing the bells.

405
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:15,214
-If something happened to him,
I'll never forgive myself.

406
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:23,055
That dear, sweet, gentle--
thoughtless ingrate!

407
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:27,326
-I'm sorry, Brother Lebasse,
please forgive me, Father.

408
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,694
-My son.

409
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,730
Where have you been?

410
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,265
-Everyone seemed so happy today.

411
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,135
I just wanted to
feel a part of it.

412
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:40,106
-Quasimodo, there was talk of
a riot today at the festival.

413
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,141
You've didn't--

414
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:44,376
-They called me a monster.

415
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,412
They screamed and ran.

416
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,115
I just wanted to be a part.

417
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:52,651
-My boy, you are a
part of this cathedral.

418
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:58,657
A part of God's family, but
because of your difference,

419
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,360
you must remain here.

420
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,329
-Father, why do
you say difference?

421
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,430
I'm ugly.

422
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,699
A freak.

423
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:10,236
A beautiful girl
danced with me today.

424
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:14,140
Until she saw what
I was really like.

425
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:19,545
-Those who know you despite your
differences love you, my son.

426
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:23,616
But for your own good, you
must remain here with us.

427
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:27,753
[knocking]

428
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:28,721
-Come, Lebasse.

429
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:29,522
It is late.

430
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:40,799
-You're gonna catch your
death sleeping out here, son.

431
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,568
Believe me.

432
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:43,969
I know.

433
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,904
-You.

434
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:45,871
-But how?

435
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,741
I mean, you're made of stone.

436
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:52,178
-Heh, heh, hey now, didn't
I hear something today

437
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:56,415
about things not being
what they appear to be?

438
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,350
[music playing]

439
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:03,155
-Ooooowe.

440
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,058
Now, let's get down to business.

441
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:06,926
-Business?

442
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,260
-Sure.

443
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,630
You've been moping around this
tower too long, my friend.

444
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:16,135
All this talk about being
ugly, and a monster and such.

445
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:18,237
It's time for a change.

446
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,973
You need a fresh attitude.

447
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:23,409
Now brothers, help me out here.

448
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:40,626
(SINGING) Hey mister bell
ringer, what's going on?

449
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:48,534
if you will excuse me, I'd
like to sing this song,

450
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,437
sing this song.

451
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:54,907
Why don't you kick back in
this drafty little place,

452
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:59,478
forget the fact you're
ugly, that's just your face!

453
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,648
What counts is on the inside.

454
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:05,017
We all know that's true.

455
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:05,951
-Do-wah.

456
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,255
-And with a heart
as big as yours,

457
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:11,857
you can't be feeling blue.

458
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,293
Feeling blue.

459
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:17,129
hey boy, smile for me,
just one little grin,

460
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:22,601
so you only got two teeth,
hey, since when is that a sin?

461
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:25,070
Just take your
blues and toss them,

462
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,840
forget about the
troubles on your mind--

463
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,708
-Do-wah.

464
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,344
-Oh man, you know,
you're awesome,

465
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,914
and everything's
going to be just fine.

466
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,248
Be just fine.

467
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:41,086
You got to roll them in a
ball and throw them all away.

468
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,823
'Cause you know tomorrow's
gonna be a brand new day.

469
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:46,292
Now take your blues
and toss them,

470
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:49,795
send those bell ringer
blues on their way.

471
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:54,833
Yeah, OK boys, listen
while I talk tonight.

472
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:03,075
Yeah, we may be ugly, but
we're still out of sight.

473
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,843
Out of sight.

474
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:07,212
Yeah, don't think
you've got it bad,

475
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,081
when you're up here all alone.

476
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:13,919
We'll never dance with a girl,
hey man, we're made of stone.

477
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,355
Just take your
blues and toss 'em,

478
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:19,491
forget about the
troubles on your mind.

479
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,893
-Do-wah.

480
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:24,630
-'Cause you know you're
awesome, everything

481
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,498
going to be just fine.

482
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,900
Be just fine.

483
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,371
You got to roll them in a
ball, throw them all away,

484
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:36,208
'cause you know tomorrow's
going to be a brand new day.

485
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,277
Take your blues
and toss 'em, send

486
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:41,447
those bell ringin'
blues on their way.

487
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:44,516
Yeah, just take your
blues and toss 'em,

488
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:49,722
send those bell ringin'
blues on their way.

489
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:57,730
[rooster crowing]

490
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,198
-You're right.

491
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:03,402
I'm going to-- huh?

492
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:04,203
Hmm.

493
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,310
Must have been dreaming.

494
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,385
-Well, I say we just
make a run for it.

495
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:20,452
That sheriff's bluffing.

496
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,489
I mean, what's the
worst he could do to us?

497
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:26,358
-Look here.

498
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,559
-Oh!

499
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,194
-That's what he could
do to us, moron.

500
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:34,233
Now shut up and help me think
of a way to grab that hunchback.

501
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,200
-Hey!

502
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,702
I know.

503
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:40,172
He was real sweet on Esmerelda.

504
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:45,677
So we just have her dance again,
and when he shows up, pow!

505
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:46,779
We got him.

506
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:49,648
-Hey, you know, I think
he's got something.

507
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,217
-You think so, huh?

508
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,519
What wrong with you losers?

509
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,686
Look around.

510
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:56,021
You notice anything?

511
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,756
Someone missing, maybe?

512
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,827
Esmerelda.

513
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:05,097
We don't have Esmerelda.

514
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:07,499
-Well, maybe we can
get someone else.

515
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,001
-Stand up, tubby.

516
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,903
-Eh, what for?

517
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,138
-'Cause you're sitting
on your brains.

518
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,673
Just stand up and turn around.

519
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,610
yeah.

520
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,746
You'll do just fine.

521
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,215
Esmerelda.

522
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,184
[laughter]

523
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:34,026
-[laughter] Look!

524
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,861
Although the people
are afraid of me,

525
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:40,466
they like the music I make.

526
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,935
Oh, there, there, little one.

527
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,470
Don't be afraid.

528
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,439
Maybe I can help you.

529
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,441
[bird singing]

530
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:04,256
-Esmerelda is going
to dance today?

531
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,725
She was so lovely.

532
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:07,860
So kind.

533
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:13,165
Pierre is certain to be there.

534
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:18,203
If only I could see
them both once again.

535
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,973
I'll be very careful,
and be back before

536
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,242
dark to ring the
evening worship.

537
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,019
-No sign of any
hunchback so far.

538
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,787
Hey, you clowns ready yet?

539
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,824
Hey, there's not enough fabric
in Paris to cover his big--

540
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:39,758
-Shut your yap!

541
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,693
This ain't no fashion show.

542
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:44,763
He's just got to flop around on
stage for these rubes 'til you

543
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,899
and me locate the hunchback.

544
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:48,567
GYPSY MAN: What's in the bottle?

545
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:49,801
-It's chloroform.

546
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:53,805
A couple of whiffs of this,
and he'll be out cold.

547
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,275
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

548
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,509
Now, come on.

549
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,478
Let's get this ape
ready for the show.

550
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:01,947
-Hey, you got a
monkey back there?

551
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:06,518
I thought I was
gonna do the dance?

552
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,854
-Psst.

553
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:09,788
Psst.

554
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:10,756
Pierre.

555
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,791
-Ah, there you are, Quasimodo.

556
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,626
I knew you couldn't
resist the chance

557
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,628
to see the fair Esmerelda again.

558
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,530
-Nor you either.

559
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,132
Have I missed anything?

560
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:20,933
-No.

561
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:24,202
You're just in time.

562
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,338
-Thank you for coming,
ladies and gentlemen.

563
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:30,175
Now, sit back and prepare
to feast your eyes on one

564
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,945
of the biggest acts
in show business.

565
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:35,747
I give you the
beautiful Esmerelda.

566
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,520
[music playing]

567
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:50,529
-Aw!

568
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,831
That is not Esmerelda.

569
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:53,632
-Hm.

570
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,100
Are you sure?

571
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,269
Maybe it's the light.

572
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,738
[panting]

573
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,246
-Well, did you see any
sign of the hunchback?

574
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,717
-No, but some guy wants me
to give this to Hermando.

575
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,051
-You idiot.

576
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,853
Didn't you see anything?

577
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,088
Anyone unusual?

578
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:19,958
-Well, there was a guy over
there talking to a bush.

579
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,693
-I remember him.

580
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,261
He was at the festival.

581
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,163
I saw him with the hunchback.

582
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,766
-Something strange is going on.

583
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,268
I've got to find out what's
happened to Esmerelda.

584
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,071
-Could there be more
than one Esmerelda?

585
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:36,408
-My friend, there is
only one Esmerelda.

586
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:38,810
And that blimp on
stage is not her.

587
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:42,247
Ugh!

588
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,048
-Pierre!

589
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:43,882
are you all right?

590
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:44,950
-It's him.

591
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,218
Hurry, use the net.

592
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,224
Sweet dreams, ugly.

593
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,996
-Well done, my cunning friends.

594
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,465
You ought to be congratulated.

595
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,367
-Don't touch his Lordship.

596
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,836
-Now, we must notify the
citizens of our fair city

597
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,372
of the capture of this criminal.

598
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,608
One citizen in particular.

599
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:12,344
-I sent word to the cathedral.

600
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:13,712
-Good.

601
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,481
then make preparations for
the execution of his sentence.

602
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:27,859
-By order of Lord Frollo, High
Sheriff of the city of Paris,

603
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:31,430
the prisoner Quasimodo
the bell ringer is hereby

604
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,534
charged with inciting a
riot in the public square.

605
00:30:35,534 --> 00:30:37,703
It is the sentence
of the Lord Sheriff

606
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:41,106
that this criminal
receive 15 lashes

607
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:43,508
as punishment for his crimes.

608
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,444
Bring forth the prisoner!

609
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:59,257
-You, you can't mean to do this.

610
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,027
Not even a man like you could--

611
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,595
-There, there, now, holy man.

612
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,531
You have only your
stubbornness to blame for this.

613
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:11,269
But perhaps you're willing
to reconsider your decision?

614
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,471
-You're mad.

615
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,339
The treasury of
the church is not

616
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,541
mine to surrender to
you or anyone else.

617
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,043
-Then stand aside padre.

618
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,482
And observe my vengeance.

619
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:24,616
Execute the sentence.

620
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,923
-Have courage my son.

621
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,292
-You incredible pig!

622
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:37,596
He's just a frightened
boy, he's harmed no one.

623
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:38,830
I was there.

624
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,198
We danced.

625
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,399
-Well.

626
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:46,671
If it's ugly you like my
sweet, I can be ugly too.

627
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,975
[laughter] Get on with it.

628
00:31:49,975 --> 00:31:52,244
-Quasimodo, Quasimodo!

629
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,212
[lashing]

630
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:16,368
-That's 15, Lord Sheriff.

631
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:18,069
-Well, what happens now?

632
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,272
You said the Archdeacon
would cooperate.

633
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,339
-Well, yes.

634
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,642
I mean, he should have.

635
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:24,442
-Water.

636
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,243
Water please.

637
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:29,714
Water.

638
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,625
Thank you.

639
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:46,264
I'm sorry you have
to look at me.

640
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,633
-You were very brave, sir.

641
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,703
I'm honored to help you.

642
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:52,971
-Seize her!

643
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:53,972
Seize that wench!

644
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:00,111
-Come my lady, we must
flee to fight again.

645
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,514
We will avenge you, my friend.

646
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,755
-After them, you fools!

647
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:11,957
After them!

648
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:14,192
Trelthume, you bungler.

649
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:16,027
This is all your doing.

650
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,530
Bring me the girl,
or I'll hang you all.

651
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,000
Now, out of my way!

652
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,435
-Dear Lord.

653
00:33:23,435 --> 00:33:25,871
They've cut him to the bone.

654
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:27,939
-No, it is not a bone.

655
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,809
It almost appears to be-- come.

656
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,278
We must get him
back to the church.

657
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,180
Easy, my boy, easy.

658
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,681
Let's go home.

659
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,049
-Yes.

660
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:38,850
Home.

661
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:45,523
-You both have loved
and protected me

662
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,359
since I was a child.

663
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,227
I should've listened to you.

664
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,196
-No, my son.

665
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:54,633
I'm afraid we were unwise
to keep you hidden.

666
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,768
We did not protect you.

667
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,804
We kept others from seeing
the beauty of your soul,

668
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,974
and the courage of your
faith and suffering.

669
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,143
-I don't understand, Father.

670
00:34:05,143 --> 00:34:07,178
-He's right, Quasimodo.

671
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:10,215
Had we taught the people to
look beyond your features,

672
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:14,452
they would have seen the love
of heaven in their midst.

673
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:15,787
Not a monster.

674
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,156
-We can only pray
that someday they

675
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:23,161
will see you as you
really are, Quasimodo.

676
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,163
-Blgug!

677
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:25,997
Umph!

678
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,400
-I'm surrounded by imbeciles.

679
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,267
Idiots!

680
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,603
Brainless louts!

681
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:34,506
-But Lord Frollo,
it's not my fault.

682
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:35,473
-Be quiet.

683
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,208
You clods!

684
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,210
My patience is at an end.

685
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,514
I'm through being soft-hearted
about all of this.

686
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:46,451
I want the Archdeacon dealt
with once and for all.

687
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:52,023
I'm really a simple man, with
simple hopes, simple dreams.

688
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:55,126
I want simply everything.

689
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,596
[music playing]

690
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:03,234
-(SINGING) If people only
understood me the way I think

691
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:07,439
they should, they'd
have a recollection

692
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,941
of all that I do good.

693
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:15,547
Just an ordinary sort of
man, in a godly sort of way--

694
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:19,017
-Ain't he the guy that told
us to put that priest away?

695
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:26,057
-Now you must pay close
attention, for I say for good

696
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:32,564
of all, my home is just a haven,
ask my friends upon the wall.

697
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:37,936
It's clear some don't appreciate
the measures I must take.

698
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:42,007
I only want, well
conquest, bust some heads.

699
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:45,944
I'm bound to break.

700
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,647
Oh, some have
called me evil, well

701
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,149
that's not my fault at all.

702
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:56,454
And those who've gotten in my
way shall learn to take a fall.

703
00:35:56,454 --> 00:36:01,693
This world will be a better
place, I'm sure you will agree,

704
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:09,601
when that holy man is gone
and his church belongs to me.

705
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:12,871
I'm a simple man
with simple goals,

706
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,607
and when it's said
and done, there'll

707
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:25,250
be no question who's in
charge, I'm simply number one.

708
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,196
-[yawn] Gwow!

709
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,832
[thud]

710
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,666
-Is everything all right?

711
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,569
-[gasp] Uh, yes.

712
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:46,137
All is well.

713
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:47,605
I'm sorry if I woke you.

714
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:51,109
-Maybe you should sleep and
let me keep watch for a while.

715
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:53,044
-Oh no, I'm fine.

716
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,346
Besides, it's such
a lovely night,

717
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,616
I'm enjoying watching the stars.

718
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,586
-It is a beautiful night.

719
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,656
I want to thank
you for helping me.

720
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,691
No one ever did
such a thing for me.

721
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:08,393
-You were so brave.

722
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,395
I couldn't help myself.

723
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:13,098
I can't help myself,
whenever I look at you.

724
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:17,502
Esmerelda, I've been in love
since I first laid eyes on you.

725
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,571
Since we danced.

726
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:20,939
Since the beginning of time.

727
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:29,681
-I've dreamed of a moment
like this all my life, Pierre.

728
00:37:29,681 --> 00:37:33,384
Of someone like you
and a night like this.

729
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:44,162
[music playing]

730
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:51,402
-(SINGING) Once upon a
dream, on a night like this,

731
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:58,777
I gave him my heart,
sealed it with a kiss--

732
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:05,517
-Once upon a dream, stars
were shining bright.

733
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:11,923
I knew at a glance that
the girl was right.

734
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:14,893
-(SINGING IN UNISON)
And baby, holding

735
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:19,831
hands looking in your eyes.

736
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:26,271
Now my heart understands,
now I realize.

737
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:27,705
I've seen you.

738
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,579
-Once upon a dream--

739
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:38,249
-There is no mistake.

740
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:44,722
-(IN UNISON) That you are for
real, now we're wide awake.

741
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,192
And all those nights--

742
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:48,693
-All those dreams.

743
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:52,830
-(IN UNISON) It was always you.

744
00:38:52,830 --> 00:39:00,238
You're my once upon
a dream come true.

745
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,445
-Oh Pierre, let's
leave this city

746
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,414
and start a new life together.

747
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:10,648
-Of course, my love.

748
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,350
Quasimodo's friend
the Archdeacon

749
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,718
can marry us in the morning.

750
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,987
And we'll be off before-- wait.

751
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:19,157
Poor Quasimodo, I'd
almost forgotten.

752
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,092
-We should go to him, Pierre.

753
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,927
He suffered so today.

754
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,629
Perhaps we could help somehow.

755
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:26,164
-It could be dangerous.

756
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:30,435
But with you by my side, I
have the courage of a lion.

757
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:34,706
--[kiss] Then the lead on,
oh King of the beasts.

758
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,607
-On to Notre Dame.

759
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:00,498
-Where would we
find the Archdeacon?

760
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,534
-Uh, don't look at
me, I'm a Protestant.

761
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,079
-You!

762
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,481
Get 'em boys!

763
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:21,219
-You!

764
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,788
[whistles] Here boy.

765
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,290
Come on boy.

766
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,270
Pierre, darling.

767
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,539
Oh, no. [cough] Pierre.

768
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:45,243
[cough] You must
[cough] you must--

769
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,685
-Grab the girl, and let's
find the Archdeacon.

770
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:58,256
Remind me to
dismantle you later.

771
00:40:58,256 --> 00:40:59,557
-What's the meaning of this?

772
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,625
What are you doing?

773
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,127
-Uh, forgive us Father.

774
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,897
We have sinned.

775
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:06,831
Whew!

776
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,232
What a night.

777
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:11,736
Now I'll just leave the
note, and we're on our way.

778
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,377
-All is ready, my Lord.

779
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:21,713
I've informed the gypsy
girl of her marriage

780
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:23,448
to you this afternoon.

781
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:29,187
And the new Archdeacon
will perform the ceremony.

782
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:32,423
-How is our guest,
the Archdeacon?

783
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:36,561
-Resting quite uncomfortably
in his prison cell.

784
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:40,598
-Well, how do I look?

785
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:44,035
-You'll do, holy Father.

786
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:45,670
-Achoo!

787
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,471
-Bless you.

788
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,239
-That's my line, stupid.

789
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,047
-The note says that the
Archdeacon was called away,

790
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:59,117
and he will return soon.

791
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:01,119
But I don't believe
a word of it.

792
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:01,953
-Ooh!

793
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:04,589
This is the sheriff's handiwork.

794
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:07,625
He's taken Esmerelda,
and the Archdeacon too.

795
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,193
-He has Father?

796
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,629
I won't let him
hurt the Archdeacon.

797
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,797
I won't!

798
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:14,966
-Quasimodo, listen, my boy.

799
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:17,402
We must be wise about this.

800
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:19,337
We must have a-- a plan.

801
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:21,072
-Make your plans then.

802
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:24,142
I just want to help my
father and Esmerelda.

803
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:27,011
-I'm afraid there's more.

804
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:30,014
I also received word
from the Sheriff's Office

805
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:33,117
that a new Archdeacon
will arrive at noon today.

806
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:38,122
To perform a wedding ceremony
between Frollo and Esmerelda.

807
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:39,757
-What?

808
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,626
Heaven help us.

809
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:43,594
-You said we need a plan.

810
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:46,330
I say we plan to
attend a wedding.

811
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,383
-Sometimes, the
keys to the kingdom

812
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:08,219
can open more than the
gates of heaven. [chuckles]

813
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:10,188
[organ music]

814
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,514
-You look lovely, my dear.

815
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:39,417
-What have you done
with Pierre, you fiend.

816
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,919
-He lives as long as you allow.

817
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:45,089
-[sigh] I'm ready.

818
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:52,530
-Proceed, your holiness.

819
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:56,234
-Ahem, dearly beloved,
the institution

820
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:59,837
of marriage is a sacred bond--

821
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,706
-Cut to the chase, nitwit.

822
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:03,274
-Uh, heh, heh.

823
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:04,876
Do you, Frollo, take this--

824
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:05,977
-Yes.

825
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,245
Go on.

826
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:09,147
-Do you, Esmerelda,
take Frollo to be

827
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:13,417
your awful wedded-- that's
lawful wedded husband?

828
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:16,320
-I-- I--

829
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,722
-Now, Quasimodo!

830
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:18,689
-[gasp] Pierre!

831
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,268
-People of Paris!

832
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:31,669
This wedding is a mockery!

833
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,470
Look!

834
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,874
See for yourselves!

835
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,809
The sheriff has
kidnapped the Archdeacon,

836
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,512
and placed this
thief in the church!

837
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,848
MAN IN CROWD: The
sheriff must be stopped!

838
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,816
WOMAN IN CROWD: He
should be hanged!

839
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:57,795
-Get him.

840
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:08,940
-Stand back.

841
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,143
I won't let him hurt you.

842
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:17,515
-You've nowhere to
run to now, you freak.

843
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:20,985
I think you need
a reminder of what

844
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:23,387
happens to those who
dare challenge me.

845
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,863
[thunder]

846
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:33,864
-No!

847
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,833
Stop it, you animal!

848
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:38,336
-Arrgh!

849
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:40,438
I'll deal with you later, wench.

850
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:45,209
-Ugh!

851
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,444
No more!

852
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:49,413
You will hurt people no more!

853
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:54,585
-Aheh, ahargh, I-- I give up.

854
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,587
You've won.

855
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,455
Ah.

856
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:00,758
I shall repent my crimes.

857
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,294
-But you shouldn't hurt people.

858
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:04,362
It's not right.

859
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:14,038
Are you all right?

860
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:15,539
-Yes.

861
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,675
I think so.

862
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:19,543
-Aaargh!

863
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:21,912
-Ugh!

864
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,314
Uh.

865
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:24,415
Uh.

866
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:25,216
-Ugh!

867
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:27,084
-Ooh!

868
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:31,689
--[laughing] I've got a hunch
we won't be seeing him anymore.

869
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:35,459
What's the matter?

870
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,963
Lost your sense
of humor my dear?

871
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,499
-You'll pay, you swine!

872
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:42,767
You'll pay.

873
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:44,702
-I think you need
a little discipline

874
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:47,605
to curb that loose
tongue of yours.

875
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:48,372
Wench.

876
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:54,745
You cursed stone creature.

877
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,784
Aah!

878
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:00,584
Aah!

879
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:07,792
-It's over darling.

880
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:09,727
Frollo's men have surrendered.

881
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:11,629
Let me help you.

882
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:14,031
-Oh Pierre. [sniff] Pierre.

883
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:15,599
-Where is Quasimodo?

884
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,435
Where is my son?

885
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:22,239
-He fell, saving my life.

886
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,541
-Dear God.

887
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,178
-Hang on, my friend.

888
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,080
I'm coming for you.

889
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,247
Get me a rope.

890
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,048
-No.

891
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,483
It is too dangerous.

892
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:34,585
-My son, please hang on.

893
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:36,487
We'll get you.

894
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:40,524
-Father, you're all right.

895
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,792
Then all is well.

896
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:44,028
I can leave in peace.

897
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,362
-My dear boy!

898
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,163
Please!

899
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,598
No!

900
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,900
-It is time, Father!

901
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:55,039
Lebasse, Pierre, my
Lady, I love you all!

902
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:12,056
-[gasp]

903
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,258
-God be praised.

904
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,726
-It's a miracle!

905
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,700
-At last.

906
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,469
They see you as you are.

907
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,773
As always were.

908
00:48:28,773 --> 00:48:29,707
Goodbye, my son.

909
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:38,282
NARRATOR: On that day, the city
witnessed a visit from heaven.

910
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:41,051
And learned that
indeed, people are not

911
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:44,121
always what they appear to be.

912
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,557
So consider my
friends, how you judge

913
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:49,360
those who appear different?

914
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,397
For so says the scripture,
be not forgetful to be

915
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:57,268
kind to others,
for thereby, some

916
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,537
have entertained
angels unawares.
