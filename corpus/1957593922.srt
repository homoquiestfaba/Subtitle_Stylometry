1
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:04,767
(MultiCom jingle)

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,000
(explosions booming)

3
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,533
(slow heroic music)

4
00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:24,400
- My name is Josh Kirby.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,633
I was just your
 average ninth grader.

6
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:30,133
My biggest problem was
 getting good grades.

7
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:33,067
And my idea of excitement
 was racing my bicycle.

8
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:35,467
(bell ringing)

9
00:00:35,467 --> 00:00:36,867
Yes!

10
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,967
I never thought time
would catch up with me.

11
00:00:38,967 --> 00:00:41,567
But I couldn't believe that

12
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:43,067
(train whistle blowing)

13
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:45,500
hundreds of years from
 now, mankind would invent

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,733
the nullifier, a device
capable of controlling

15
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:50,000
or destroying the universe.

16
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:53,167
- [Alien] Prepare for the storm.

17
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:56,600
- A scientist, named Irwin
 1138 tried to disassemble

18
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,933
and hide the nullifier.

19
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,233
But even he couldn't stop.

20
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:01,233
- [Irwin] Dr. Zoetrope!

21
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:03,967
(lasers zapping)

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,100
- Give me the nullifier.

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,467
- You're too late, Zoetrope.

24
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:11,433
- It's never too late for me.

25
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:12,933
(engine roaring)

26
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:14,567
- Irwin and Zoetrope have
 been chasing each other

27
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:16,267
across the time strip
 trying to be the first

28
00:01:16,267 --> 00:01:18,900
to find the nullifier in pieces.

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,933
This time, they go in to 1995.

30
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:24,067
The place, my front yard.

31
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:29,667
Now, I'm going along for
the ride of all time.

32
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:31,100
(laser zapping)

33
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,100
(engine roaring)

34
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,933
What's going on?

35
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:34,200
Where are we?

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,333
- I hope you're prepared
to do battle young man.

37
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,933
This will be war through
time and Dr. Zoetrope

38
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,833
will take no prisoners.

39
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:44,167
(explosions booming)

40
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:45,933
(dramatic music)

41
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:46,933
(dinosaur roaring)

42
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:48,533
- We've got help from a warrior.

43
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:51,100
- My name is Azabeth Siege.

44
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,833
- Ah, she's amazing.

45
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,333
(metal clanging)

46
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,833
And a magical creature called
 Prism to show us the way.

47
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,067
Together, we're on
 a quest through time

48
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:01,633
visiting different
 worlds to fight

49
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:03,900
for the nullifier's pieces.

50
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,067
- I'm obviously in the right
 place and the right time.

51
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:09,533
(lasers zapping)

52
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,633
- Because if Zoetrope ever
 assembles the nullifier,

53
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:14,533
he'll conquer time itself.

54
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:16,467
I've gotta try and
 save the universe.

55
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:19,633
(heroic action music)

56
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:03,600
I was just a 14 year old kid
 before my adventure began.

57
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,767
But now, I'm Josh
 Kirby, time warrior.

58
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:11,167
(heroic action music)

59
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,367
- [Narrator] On the last
chapter of Josh Kirby,

60
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:32,067
Time Warrior.

61
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:34,333
(dramatic music)

62
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,833
(explosions booming)

63
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,233
- Captain, his forces have
 had us under constant siege.

64
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,233
(explosions booming)

65
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:41,967
- You know what I want.

66
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:44,533
The enslavement of
 your entire planet.

67
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:46,800
(laughing)

68
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,433
- [Azabeth] He's taking the
 carrier into his tractor beam.

69
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:51,400
- [Josh] He's buying it.

70
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,833
- Closer, closer.

71
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,700
(explosions booming)

72
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,300
(screaming)

73
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,100
(screaming)

74
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,733
(men grunting and screaming)

75
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,900
(screaming)

76
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,533
(dramatic music)

77
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:16,500
(music drowns out speakers)

78
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,667
(electricity zapping)

79
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,833
(screaming)

80
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:31,067
- Jumping meteors, it's
the fifth component.

81
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,233
- What is that?

82
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,233
(screaming)

83
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:01,733
- The nullifier
 components, they're gone!

84
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:04,133
- (mumbles)?

85
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,133
These are a delicacy
 on my planet.

86
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,533
- Ouch!

87
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,700
- Holy!

88
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,800
- That didn't tickle, you know.

89
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,900
- Irwin?
- Yeah.

90
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,533
- Irwin, uh, what's happening?

91
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,067
- Fascinating.

92
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:21,867
Fungi.

93
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
- [Josh] Yeah, yeah, they look
 like they could be fun guys.

94
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,233
- No no, not fun guys, fungi.

95
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,167
I mean, parasitic
 bacterial organisms

96
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:35,067
that thrive mainly on
 moisture and nitrogen.

97
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:37,767
- Yeah, yeah they're mushrooms.

98
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:40,267
I hate mushrooms, I hate 'em.

99
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,900
Except on pizza.

100
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,800
(mysterious music)

101
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:49,367
- Oh beloved furry one.

102
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,133
All great and powerful.

103
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:55,133
You have finally come to
 deliver us from the Muncher.

104
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:59,067
- Irwin, Irwin, why are
they praying to Prism?

105
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:03,200
- Apparently they must think
 Prism is some form of deity.

106
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:07,767
- Yeah, right, the furry one.

107
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:08,600
- Yes.

108
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,267
Now be careful with
 Prism, mushroom folk.

109
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,867
He's one of a kind.

110
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:20,900
(chanting)

111
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,800
- Thank you for
delivering the furry one

112
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,067
back to his rightful place.

113
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:37,433
- Azabeth.

114
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:38,967
- Don't worry, Josh, she's
probably just a little bit woozy

115
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:41,533
from the air down
 here, that's all.

116
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:44,700
- Irwin, Irwin, that
 mushroom she ate.

117
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,667
- It could be that these fungi
 aren't meant for consumption

118
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:53,100
by carbon-based life forms.

119
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,600
- You mean she's poisoned?

120
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,100
- That could very
 well be the case, yes.

121
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,300
- It's not my fault.

122
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,467
She took a bite out of me.

123
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,533
This is too much.

124
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:04,967
- She won't die, will she?

125
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:06,967
I mean, she only took one bite.

126
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:08,400
- Well organisms have
 different tolerances

127
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,333
relative to a dose of poison.

128
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,100
The line between
no effect at all

129
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,067
and a lethal dose
 can be very thin.

130
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,500
- It's alright.

131
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,733
I'm better now.

132
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,733
- Okay.

133
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:25,167
Irwin, we've got to
 find an antidote.

134
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,300
- Yes but where, how?

135
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,733
- I don't know,
there's gotta be a way!

136
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,167
- It is a tragedy
 to happen to such

137
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:33,800
a loyal disciple
 of the furry one.

138
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,067
Our king will know what to do.

139
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:37,967
Come, come.

140
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:50,567
(grand music)

141
00:09:15,933 --> 00:09:18,867
(trumpets playing)

142
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:23,633
(grand music)

143
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:45,067
- Hello, Porcini.

144
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:47,733
What is the meaning of
 bringing these strange beings

145
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:50,367
into my royal chamber?

146
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:51,700
- Lord Truffle.

147
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,567
These are the furry
 one's followers.

148
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:57,833
The signorina, she took
a bite out of one of

149
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,067
your loyal subjects.

150
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,833
Now she's very sick.

151
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,000
I tell them maybe
 you know what to do.

152
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,133
- Lord Truffle.

153
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:10,733
The furry one is most
 bummed out at the illness

154
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:12,400
of his loyal follower.

155
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,233
So could you help her?

156
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,733
- I summon the royal doctor.

157
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,300
(trumpets playing)

158
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,233
(whimsical music)

159
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:39,100
- Please to say ah.

160
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,600
- I'm not about to let you
 stick that evil torture device

161
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,100
in my mouth.

162
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,733
- Azabeth, relax, it's
just a tongue depressor.

163
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:50,200
- My tongue is depressed
enough, Josh Kirby.

164
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,733
- Azabeth, let him look,
 he's just trying to help.

165
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:54,567
- Ah.

166
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,033
- Ah.

167
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,733
(tutting)

168
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:02,967
- [Josh] What's wrong?

169
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:04,600
- Teeth full of cavities.

170
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,067
Must brush more.

171
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,400
(laughing)

172
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,233
- Yeah, yeah that's
 really funny.

173
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:12,667
Look, what's wrong with her?

174
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:16,300
- Please understand I am
 only humble shroom physician.

175
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,800
- Doc, hey doc.

176
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,433
You think you can
 take a look at this?

177
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:23,067
- You took bite?

178
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:24,367
- Yes.

179
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,533
- Oh no.

180
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:27,133
Very bad.

181
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,300
Only one antidote.

182
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,267
Must taste from one
 shroom's spores, Puffball.

183
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:35,067
- So where do we find
 this Puffball guy?

184
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:39,167
- Oh, I'm very sorry but
 Puffball is no longer with us.

185
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,233
- Puffball's been
snatched by the Muncher.

186
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:46,900
- Then we'll just have
 to snatch him back.

187
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,900
- What manner of
 creature is this Muncher?

188
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,400
- Oh, it is a most
 horrible, horrible beast.

189
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,733
He traps and eats shrooms

190
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,767
for breakfast,
 lunch, and dinner.

191
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,100
Without stop.

192
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,867
- Muncher first appeared
at Dream Cavern.

193
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,767
Was once most beautiful place.

194
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,800
Biggest tourist attraction
 of all of Shroom Town.

195
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,500
But now off limits.

196
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,067
- It has turned the
 entire shroom economy

197
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,400
into a shambles.

198
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,267
- Now it's called
 Nightmare Hollow.

199
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,233
Nobody go there no more.

200
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,667
- But surely it's
 just a matter of time

201
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:30,467
before this monster,
 Muncher, do you call him?

202
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,200
Tracks you down here.

203
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,433
- Yeah, that's why we've
gotta find him first.

204
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:39,200
Look, we'll find Puffball,
 get the antidote for Azabeth,

205
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,600
and get rid of this Muncher
 thing all at the same time.

206
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,233
- Not a difficult mission
 when armed with a 25th century

207
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:46,633
scientific marvel such
 as my power staff.

208
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,800
(beeping)

209
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,500
Blast!

210
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,967
I must have forgotten to
 recharge the firing mechanism

211
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:55,333
before I left the time pod.

212
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:57,933
- Well please,
 you've gotta help us.

213
00:12:57,933 --> 00:13:00,633
You've gotta lead us to
this Nightmare Hollow.

214
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,633
- Oh great furry one.

215
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:04,067
(squeaking)

216
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:06,267
Accept my most humble apologies.

217
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:10,433
I cannot accede to the wishes
 of your groveling servants.

218
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:16,700
The hall to Nightmare Hollow
 is sure shroom suicide.

219
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,900
- [Shroom] Yes.

220
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,833
- No one who goes
 there, shroom or not,

221
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,733
will ever return alive.

222
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,533
- Look, we're going, with
 or without your help,

223
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:28,267
and the furry one's
 coming with us.

224
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:31,300
- Boy, you forget yourself!

225
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,967
You are talking to the
 ruler of all shrooms!

226
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,933
- Hey!

227
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:43,833
- The audience is over.

228
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:48,900
We have much more important
 business on our agenda.

229
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,067
- What'd you do to Prism?

230
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:56,333
- I have put the furry
one to sleep for today.

231
00:13:56,333 --> 00:14:00,300
He needs his rest as all
of us below ground do.

232
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:03,667
Guards!

233
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:04,900
- [Guards] Yes my lord.

234
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,733
- Take the furry one's
followers to the grotto

235
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:09,333
for their own protection.

236
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,833
(dramatic music)

237
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,333
- Porcini!

238
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:16,133
- I'm sorry Josh, you must
 do as Lord Truffle says.

239
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:20,900
Lord, may we not let the
furry one's disciples

240
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,733
go after Puffball?

241
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:25,067
It could mean the
 signorina's life.

242
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:27,500
- How can you ask that, Porcini?

243
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,767
You know that the Muncher
 has seriously decimated

244
00:14:29,767 --> 00:14:31,767
our population.

245
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:35,533
You also know that I am
cultivating new subjects

246
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:39,333
in the royal cave
 gardens even as we speak.

247
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,133
Our numbers are few.

248
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:45,267
Are you asking me to risk
 antagonizing the Muncher

249
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:48,167
just when we've
 begun to rebuild?

250
00:14:48,167 --> 00:14:51,733
- No, no, that is, I
understand you highness

251
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:52,900
but you see--

252
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,733
- But, but nothing, Porcini.

253
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:57,400
The issue is closed.

254
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:00,933
- Yes lord.

255
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:06,567
(dramatic music)

256
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:09,067
- Along with you, don't tarry.

257
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,400
- I must rest, Josh Kirby.

258
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,733
- She's burning up.

259
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:48,567
- Yeah.

260
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,100
We've gotta get out of here!

261
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,767
- Not the best of occasions
 for your time powers

262
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,067
to be in rejuvenation mode.

263
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,167
(bubbling)

264
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,733
- Ah, oh, ha ha.

265
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:16,867
Ay, ay.

266
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:20,400
Ah.

267
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,933
- Doctor Shiitake!
 - Ay!

268
00:16:28,233 --> 00:16:31,733
- I must ask you for
 a very great favor.

269
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:34,933
- Shiitake will see
 if he can grant it.

270
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:38,167
- The furry one's followers,
 they need our help.

271
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:42,067
Lord Truffle forbids it
but I know he's wrong.

272
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,767
- I agree with you, Porcini.

273
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,067
- You do?

274
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:49,333
- Have been considering
the same issue myself.

275
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:51,333
Come to same conclusion as you.

276
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,167
- That's wonderful!

277
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:57,567
I will lead them to
Nightmare Hollow myself!

278
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:59,533
- Nightmare Hollow?

279
00:16:59,533 --> 00:17:03,633
- But they must take the
furry one with them too.

280
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,767
- No problem!

281
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,200
Shiitake can get
 furry one released

282
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,333
by telling Lord
Truffle furry one needs

283
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,400
full medical examination.

284
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,900
- Ooh, that's terrific.

285
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,900
(laughing)

286
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,900
You get the furry one and
 meet me at the grotto.

287
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,933
- Hai!

288
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:31,300
(exciting music)

289
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:37,267
- You two are dismissed,
go get us some chow.

290
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:38,900
- Chow time!

291
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,733
(whimsical music)

292
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:44,867
- Hey.

293
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:50,067
- Porcini!

294
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:53,900
- I come to lead you to
 Puffball and Nightmare Hollow.

295
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,867
How's the signorina?

296
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,967
- I'm alright.

297
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,833
- Prism!

298
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,200
Wait, but he's still asleep!

299
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,233
- Yes, I could not wake.

300
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:26,867
Shroom king sleep spores
especially strong.

301
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:28,500
- When will he wake up?

302
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,133
- Could happen soon.

303
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:31,633
Or not so soon.

304
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:35,933
What will happen, until then
 Shiitake would be honored

305
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:40,400
if you carry furry one
 in Shiitake's papoose.

306
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,233
- Yeah.

307
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,433
(coughing)

308
00:19:01,533 --> 00:19:04,300
- This is for you to eat.

309
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,700
- What is it?

310
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,167
- Beet root.

311
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:10,400
Beet root make you better,
 but listen carefully.

312
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,100
Work for 12 yabbadabbas only.

313
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,900
- 12 yabbadabbas?

314
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,667
How are we supposed to
 know how long that is?

315
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:25,333
- When sand runs
 out her time is up.

316
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:30,967
(suspenseful music)

317
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:32,867
- Is there any way you
 can give us a couple more?

318
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,067
- Afraid not.

319
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,433
Beet root ancient, very rare.

320
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,967
If you not find Puffball
before time runs out,

321
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:44,433
she fall into deep
 sleep, never wake up.

322
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,533
- Josh, look.

323
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:52,067
I know you care deeply
 about Azabeth Siege as I do.

324
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,767
Sometimes you've got to
look at the big picture.

325
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:58,300
There is still the
 universe to save.

326
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,233
- What good is the universe
 without your friends?

327
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:05,633
Besides, this Muncher
thing, it eats shrooms.

328
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:07,333
Probably people.

329
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,833
And I'll bet it eats
 nullifier components.

330
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:14,667
- Point well taken.

331
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,867
Now if the nullifier
 components brought us here,

332
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:22,233
the pieces must be lost
 somewhere in this cavern.

333
00:20:22,233 --> 00:20:23,567
- Let us go my friends.

334
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:25,467
Time is of the essence.

335
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:30,500
(coughing)

336
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,433
(mysterious music)

337
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,867
- I must rest, Josh Kirby.

338
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:56,467
- No, later Azabeth.

339
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:59,500
Right now every minute counts.

340
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,367
- Water.

341
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,767
So much water.

342
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,600
- Wait, Azabeth, Azabeth wait!

343
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:16,133
Where do you see water?

344
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,467
- It's everywhere.

345
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:21,467
- Oh she's hallucinating, Josh.

346
00:21:21,467 --> 00:21:23,067
Must be a side
 effect of the poison.

347
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:27,167
- Oh, mamma mia, what's
 happening to the furry one?

348
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:31,133
- Oh, even when he's
asleep Prism is sniffing

349
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:33,133
the nullifier component.

350
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:36,300
It must be this way.

351
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,300
- Wait, we've got
 to save Azabeth!

352
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
- Relax.

353
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,567
This won't take long, Josh.

354
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:04,400
Moisture on the ceiling.

355
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
Brr, clammy.

356
00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:08,367
Ah.

357
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,133
Eureka!

358
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:12,300
Ha ha ha!

359
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,233
One down, five to go.

360
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,933
- You were right, Azabeth.

361
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:27,667
There was water here.

362
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:35,567
- Not only that, but this
 way, she is a shortcut.

363
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,933
She'll take us to Nightmare
 Hollow in half of the time.

364
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:38,933
- Excellent!

365
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:41,733
- After you!

366
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:43,600
- No, after you!

367
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,067
- Gratzi signore.

368
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:55,833
(singing in Italian)

369
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,067
- Porcini!

370
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:25,667
You're a shroom of many talents.

371
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,167
- And I sing too.

372
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:33,400
(laughing)

373
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,500
- The bells are ringing,
they're ringing.

374
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,733
- What'd she say, Josh?

375
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:42,900
- I don't know,
 something about bells.

376
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,933
- Have courage, Josh.

377
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:49,800
This ordeal is almost over.

378
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,800
(suspenseful music)

379
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:02,533
- Yeah, yeah I hope so Irwin.

380
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:03,933
I really hope so.

381
00:24:06,467 --> 00:24:09,400
(mysterious music)

382
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,233
- I don't believe it.

383
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:22,800
- You don't believe what?

384
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,067
- [Dingdong] Who's out there?

385
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:26,967
- It's us, I mean
 it's me, Porcini.

386
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,167
Mamma mia, little Dingadong!

387
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:31,800
We thought you were
 taken by the Muncher.

388
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,400
- The name is Ding!

389
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,400
(dramatic music)

390
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,267
Your holiness, I'm not
worthy, I'm not worthy.

391
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:45,967
How come you asleep?

392
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,733
- Dingadong, not now.

393
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,433
You can grovel later.

394
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:55,833
Right now you must join
me to help the furry one

395
00:24:55,833 --> 00:24:58,633
and his servants
 rescue the lost ones.

396
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:00,867
This girl here, she's sick.

397
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,733
If we don't find your
 daddy Puffball soon,

398
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,700
she's gonna get sicker.

399
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,100
Hey, by the way your mama,
 she's worried sick about you.

400
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,267
- Yeah, well I know she's
 been worried about Dad too

401
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:12,833
ever since he disappeared.

402
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:15,400
Maybe if anyone had the
 nerve to form a search party,

403
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,067
there might be
 some shred of hope!

404
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:20,733
- Hey Porcini, who's your pal?

405
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:22,233
- What's it to ya, freak?

406
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:24,433
- Freak, who you calling freak?

407
00:25:24,433 --> 00:25:25,567
You're the talking mushroom.

408
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:28,133
(bells ringing)

409
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:31,367
- Oh oh, Josh, Josh,
 this is Dingadong.

410
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:34,500
Please excuse him.

411
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,267
His papa disappeared in
 Nightmare Hollow last week.

412
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:44,067
His papa is Puffball, the
 same mushroom we seek, eh.

413
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:45,733
- Oh, that lousy Muncher.

414
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:47,400
I'm gonna turn him
 into shroom food

415
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,800
if it's the last thing I do!

416
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,067
- Oh!

417
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:52,333
You're too young for
 a vendetta, Dingadong.

418
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,700
- Think so?

419
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,200
I'm gathering enough
 ammunition to get the Muncher

420
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,367
all by myself.

421
00:25:57,567 --> 00:26:00,800
- Very brave, my boy,
 but also very foolish.

422
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,067
A well thought out plan is
 the best weapon you can have.

423
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:06,833
- Those are my
 plans right there.

424
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,900
That's plan A, that's plan
 B, and this is plan C.

425
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,067
- Not bad.

426
00:26:20,067 --> 00:26:23,133
But you may want to discard
 some of the heavier stones.

427
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:24,867
Although they appear
 more threatening they can

428
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:27,667
throw off your aim and in
 the end be less effective

429
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:31,167
than one perfectly
aimed small sharp rock.

430
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,700
- Cool.

431
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,733
I never had that effect
on a female before.

432
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,467
- Now look she's sick.

433
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,433
We've got to find the
Muncher and your father

434
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:44,267
in, well, in however
 many yabbadabbas this is.

435
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:46,767
- I'll show you the way.

436
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,933
It can get pretty dark up ahead.

437
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:53,067
And there are millions
 of passages leading
 every which way.

438
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:55,900
And my ringing
 will come in handy,

439
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,300
and then we can really
kick some Muncher butt.

440
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,633
(exciting music)

441
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:02,200
- I would be proud to
 kick some Muncher butt

442
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,700
alongside you, young Dingdong.

443
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,467
- Yeah, me too pal.

444
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:09,300
- Ah.

445
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:14,667
(mysterious music)

446
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:31,633
(coughs)

447
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:33,133
- Come on, hold it up.

448
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:36,900
- I thank you, Josh Kirby, I
 just need to catch my breath.

449
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:41,533
Oh the sky, out of the
 sky, look, look out.

450
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:44,400
- What's wrong with her?

451
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,867
- Azabeth Siege
 is hallucinating.

452
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:49,733
- Sure, but then
 they happen for real.

453
00:27:49,733 --> 00:27:51,400
- Yeah that's right.

454
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,633
They're like premonitions.

455
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:56,067
She head the bells ringing
 and then we met Dingdong.

456
00:27:56,067 --> 00:27:59,400
- What does she mean
 by out of the sky?

457
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,067
- I don't know, I guess
we keep looking up.

458
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:09,067
- What is the source of your
 ringing, little Dingdong?

459
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,233
- I get it from my dad's
side of the family.

460
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:12,567
We're bell shrooms.

461
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,133
- Oh.

462
00:28:14,133 --> 00:28:16,667
Are you capable
 of controlling it?

463
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:19,067
- I'm trying to
 learn, it's not easy.

464
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:20,433
I'm only 13.

465
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:22,167
Older shrooms can make
 all kinds of rings

466
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,333
whenever they want to.

467
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:28,133
- Bell shrooms are most
 respected among our people.

468
00:28:28,133 --> 00:28:32,167
They can make a pleasing
music or sound the alarm

469
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:34,067
when danger threatens.

470
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:39,300
- I'm alright now, we can go on.

471
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:42,567
(chirping)

472
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:44,333
- [Dingdong] Awesome.

473
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:46,767
- [Irwin] Look, Prism's
on the trail of another

474
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,733
nullifier component.

475
00:28:48,733 --> 00:28:52,633
- He's almost better at it
 asleep then he is awake.

476
00:28:52,633 --> 00:28:55,133
Irwin, we don't have much time!

477
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,400
- This won't take long.

478
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,667
- Yeah, that's what
 you said last time.

479
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:17,833
There's nothing here.

480
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:19,967
- It's impossible.

481
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:22,100
Prism's coat of many colors--

482
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,333
- Never lies, I know.

483
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,200
But maybe he's malfunctioning.

484
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,767
There's a first
 time for everything.

485
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:29,667
- That's the 11th code of Kang.

486
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,733
- Oh, remember, we gotta
be watching the sky.

487
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:35,067
(burbling)

488
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,067
- Irwin, are you getting
shorter or am I getting taller?

489
00:29:48,067 --> 00:29:50,400
- No, we're exactly the same.

490
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,667
- Oh, it's quicksand!

491
00:29:58,833 --> 00:29:59,667
Get out!

492
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:11,000
(ringing)

493
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,567
Everybody stay back,
 it's dangerous!

494
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:16,400
Stay back!

495
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,133
- Quick, take my hand!

496
00:30:25,733 --> 00:30:26,900
Come on, pull!

497
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,933
Hurry, something!

498
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:34,933
Irwin grab hold of this, quick!

499
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,933
- No, no, it's too
 valuable to risk!

500
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:41,967
(groaning)

501
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,467
- [Josh] Come on!

502
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,700
- Goodbye, Josh,
 Azabeth, little Prism.

503
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:50,933
It's been wonderful knowing you.

504
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:54,400
- [Josh] No, don't let go!

505
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,633
Don't let go!

506
00:30:58,633 --> 00:31:00,800
(ringing)

507
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:03,400
Help!

508
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:08,800
Are you sure we're supposed
 to be looking in the sky?

509
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,600
- You have to let
 go of his hand.

510
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,933
I'm not strong enough
 to pull you both up.

511
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:14,200
- No, I can't!

512
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,333
Just let go!

513
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,267
- You must!

514
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,367
- No, I won't!

515
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:23,133
- Josh Kirby, I refuse
to let you die this way!

516
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,200
- Stand back!

517
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,933
- [Josh] Porcini!

518
00:31:27,933 --> 00:31:31,267
- I got it, give me your hand!

519
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:33,433
(mumbles)

520
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:43,633
- Irwin, come on, just a
 little more, keep it going!

521
00:31:43,633 --> 00:31:45,800
(panting)

522
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,567
(coughing)

523
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:56,933
- What's that?

524
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:02,367
- It's another
 nullifier component.

525
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,800
It stands to reason.

526
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,067
If all the pieces were strewn
 here during the cave in,

527
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:09,600
then there must be pieces that
 are hidden from plain sight.

528
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,867
(laughing)

529
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:15,667
- How'd you manage
 to pull us both out?

530
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:19,067
- Don't think just because
 we're small we're not strong.

531
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:21,867
- That certainly
 was a close call.

532
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,200
- Yeah, I'd say.

533
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,333
- We could have missed finding
 this nullifier component.

534
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,200
- Hey Porcini, does the
furry one show any signs

535
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,300
of waking up?

536
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:43,067
- Afraid not.

537
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:45,900
He's still in furry
 one dreamland.

538
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,733
- Great.

539
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,267
So how old are you anyway, Ding?

540
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:57,633
- 15.

541
00:32:57,633 --> 00:32:58,600
- Oh yeah?

542
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,867
I'm 14.

543
00:32:59,867 --> 00:33:02,133
- Yeah, you look
 tall for your age.

544
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:03,567
- Maybe here.

545
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,900
Back home I'm kinda average.

546
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:11,300
So I guess you're pretty
 worried about your dad, huh?

547
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,500
- Yeah.

548
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,067
Even though he really
 bugs me sometimes.

549
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:18,267
I told him once I
 wished he'd go away.

550
00:33:18,267 --> 00:33:19,200
(sentimental music)

551
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,633
Gee, I really didn't mean it.

552
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:22,833
- Sure.

553
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:24,700
We all say things
 we're sorry for later.

554
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,467
- Well, my dad can be
a real pain in the cap.

555
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:31,233
The funny thing is now
 I miss him bugging me.

556
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,100
- Yeah, I know what
 you mean for sure.

557
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,300
- We should move on, my friends.

558
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,067
(exciting music)

559
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,333
- Josh.

560
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,433
- Whoa!

561
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,433
- Porcini.

562
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:07,433
(zapping)

563
00:34:07,433 --> 00:34:10,100
(ominous music)

564
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,267
- Where am I?

565
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,067
I'm obviously underground.

566
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,300
Hello, what's this?

567
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:33,067
Ah, well I'm obviously
 in the right place

568
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:34,633
and the right time.

569
00:34:36,067 --> 00:34:36,833
Yeah.

570
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,533
- Azabeth is different
 looking than you.

571
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:58,467
Do all females of your
 kind look like her?

572
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:00,667
- Not really, but kind of.

573
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,300
She come from, well the
 best way I can describe it

574
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,200
is an alternate future.

575
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,867
- Future, you mean another time?

576
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:09,333
- Yeah.

577
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:12,467
Azabeth's from a twisted
 version of the 33rd century.

578
00:35:12,467 --> 00:35:14,067
Irwin's from what will
 hopefully once again

579
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:15,833
be the 25th century,

580
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:19,233
and I'm from the strictly
 legitimate 20th century.

581
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:21,600
- How can that happen?

582
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,800
- Well we have pieces
 of what is called

583
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,833
the nullifier component.

584
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:27,867
It's powerful enough to
destroy the universe.

585
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:29,867
Irwin's been traveling
 in a time pod he invented

586
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:32,133
to try and recover
 all the pieces.

587
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:33,600
And I've been helping him.

588
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,533
- You've been helping
 him destroy the universe?

589
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,533
Why?

590
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:37,767
- Oh no, no.

591
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:39,100
I've been helping him
 keep this other guy,

592
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,933
Dr. Zoetrope, from
getting all the pieces.

593
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:44,367
See Zoetrope's crazy enough
 to want to reassemble

594
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:48,067
the nullifier and
 destroy the world.

595
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:49,867
Irwin chased one of the
 components to my backyard

596
00:35:49,867 --> 00:35:51,500
and I kinda got
 stuck helping him.

597
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,767
For a while it was kind
of a race against time.

598
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:55,167
And through time.

599
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,600
To beat Zoetrope in
getting all the pieces.

600
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,667
And now Zoetrope's got
 'em we've still got to get

601
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,233
all the pieces before he can
 retrace our steps through

602
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:04,600
time and restore the natural
 order of the time stream.

603
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,500
- [Dingdong] So that's
 how you met Azabeth?

604
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,967
- [Josh] Yeah.

605
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:09,200
We just came from her
 own time where she helped

606
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,633
lead her people
 in a slave revolt.

607
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:11,467
- Wow.

608
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:15,433
- Yeah we've been on
 so many adventures.

609
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:17,867
We rode dinosaurs
 in medieval England,

610
00:36:17,867 --> 00:36:19,700
escaped from a giant
 mutant kid who had us

611
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,100
trapped as human pets.

612
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
- Zowie!

613
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,500
After all you've been through

614
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,933
the Muncher must not
 scare you at all!

615
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,367
- No way!

616
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:28,967
Nothing scares me now.

617
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:31,133
(buzzing)

618
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,067
Whoa!

619
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,333
Ah!

620
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,633
(ominous music)

621
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:37,567
- Stingers!

622
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,567
- These sting like bees
back home, only worse!

623
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:51,967
- We must be near their nest.

624
00:36:52,967 --> 00:36:53,800
There!

625
00:36:58,567 --> 00:37:00,600
- Why are they only
 coming after me?

626
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,067
- Stingers sting
 the first organism

627
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:04,567
and then they sting until
 that organism is dead.

628
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:06,900
Then they go after the next one.

629
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,400
- Sting me til I'm dead?

630
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,533
You gotta be kidding me!

631
00:37:09,533 --> 00:37:11,233
(mumbles)

632
00:37:11,233 --> 00:37:12,667
- If we get far enough
 away from their nest

633
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,667
they usually leave you alone.

634
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:15,667
- Usually?

635
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:16,667
That's just great.

636
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,567
(speaking Italian)

637
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,900
- Oh, that was a close
one for you, Josh Kirby.

638
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,700
- Yeah, you're telling me.

639
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,733
- We should press on, people.

640
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:41,133
- Azabeth, can you walk?

641
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,400
- Yes.

642
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,067
- Azabeth is right
 about looking up.

643
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:45,200
I wonder what's next?

644
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
- The walls.

645
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:49,967
(mysterious music)

646
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,267
Pictures on the walls.

647
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:53,100
The story.

648
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,267
The story is true.

649
00:37:56,267 --> 00:37:58,367
- What can she mean?

650
00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:00,300
- Paintings on walls.

651
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,433
- It could mean anything.

652
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:04,300
- I'm not so sure, mister.

653
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,600
Me, I like to know what's
 on the itinerary myself.

654
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,533
- Painting on the wall.

655
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,633
- Hey, the wall is painted!

656
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:27,300
- Holy moly.

657
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,667
- Fascinating.

658
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:32,067
- Ooh, it's like the
 catacombs beneath

659
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:34,467
the ancient city of Mushroom.

660
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:39,733
(ominous music)

661
00:39:04,233 --> 00:39:05,733
- Shroom, shrooms.

662
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,700
What is a shroom?

663
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:19,833
(growling)

664
00:39:22,267 --> 00:39:24,600
- What does this mean?

665
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,900
- It's like a caveman painting.

666
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,067
Only with UFOs and aliens.

667
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,467
- You can't see the
 forest for the trees, boy.

668
00:39:35,467 --> 00:39:37,667
The centerpiece of
 this entire painting

669
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,667
is the nullifier device.

670
00:39:41,067 --> 00:39:44,233
- This whole thing has
 gotten really weird.

671
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:46,633
- Dingadong, this is much
 bigger than our little

672
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:49,467
shroom world has
 ever seen before.

673
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:52,067
- Irwin, look.

674
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:54,633
There's another one over here.

675
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:55,800
More than one.

676
00:39:57,467 --> 00:40:00,333
Irwin, there's got to be
more than one nullifier.

677
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,733
- Impossible.

678
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,333
- See for yourself!

679
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,600
- Well this painting
 appears to be geniune.

680
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,333
Let's time date it.

681
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,500
(beeping)

682
00:40:26,867 --> 00:40:29,600
It dates at 12
 million years old.

683
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:32,800
- But if there's another
nullifier device,

684
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,100
where could it be?

685
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,367
- I don't know.

686
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:38,633
This whole painting
 belongs to an alien culture

687
00:40:38,633 --> 00:40:41,333
that's completely unknown to me.

688
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,300
It has a history no one knows.

689
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,533
- I bet the furry one knows.

690
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:49,633
- Hey, what do you
 mean Dingadong?

691
00:40:49,633 --> 00:40:51,600
- Doesn't anyone but
 me notice something

692
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,133
about the furry one
 and these little guys?

693
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:56,367
(magical music)

694
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:58,667
- Great jumping ions,
 I think the little

695
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:01,267
bell shroom is on to something.

696
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:14,067
- You know there is a shroom
 legend about such a thing

697
00:41:14,067 --> 00:41:15,600
like this painting.

698
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:19,567
All the mushrooms
 know the sacred story.

699
00:41:19,567 --> 00:41:24,300
The furry one, he come
 here many, many years ago

700
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,967
and he come from far, far away.

701
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:31,333
They hold in their hands
 the secrets of the universe.

702
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:34,100
And only they know how
 to use the secrets.

703
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,800
Hey, it is the furry ones
 that keep everything in order!

704
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,300
- In order?

705
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,900
- They make the mushroom
 kingdom what it is today.

706
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,267
They keep things going
 in the right way.

707
00:41:45,267 --> 00:41:49,433
You know, like
 the, um, (mumbles),

708
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,233
the progress of things!

709
00:41:55,433 --> 00:41:58,833
The water, the water,
 it comes down to us

710
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:04,500
from the stream over there
 so we grow and the prosper

711
00:42:05,633 --> 00:42:06,467
down here.

712
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,133
Each day we know
 there is a next day.

713
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:16,067
And like that.

714
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:16,833
Capisce?

715
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,833
- You mean the time continuum.

716
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:28,133
Don't you see what he's saying?

717
00:42:28,133 --> 00:42:32,300
He's saying that the furry
 ones established linear time

718
00:42:33,733 --> 00:42:37,367
on this planet, without which
 you would have no progress.

719
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:41,700
Because in random time
it's impossible to build

720
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,200
tomorrow on today.

721
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:46,367
- Irwin, are you saying
that Prism is the key

722
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,133
to the secret to the universe?

723
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:49,600
- No Josh.

724
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,767
Not the key but a key.

725
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:55,833
This whole picture is
 like, like pages in a book.

726
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:57,667
Look.

727
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:02,100
On this page you have
the furry ones abducting

728
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:05,167
the nullifier from
 these alien people

729
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:07,400
and here you have the
 boat which has always

730
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,433
been a symbol for the
 transfer of knowledge

731
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:10,800
from one age to the other.

732
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,067
He's bringing the knowledge
 to another people.

733
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:15,367
And here, the furry
 ones have hundreds

734
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:17,967
if not thousands of nullifiers.

735
00:43:19,433 --> 00:43:21,933
While on the last page.

736
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:25,233
- Yeah, what about
 the last page?

737
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:28,800
- The last page is
being written now, Josh.

738
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,400
- This is sacrilege!

739
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,133
How dare you speak this
way about the furry one!

740
00:43:35,133 --> 00:43:37,267
You hairless ignorant
 smoother skins

741
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:40,500
should be ashamed of yourselves.

742
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,300
- I'm reminded of the
very first code of Kang.

743
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,567
- Yeah, what's that one again?

744
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:47,800
- Things are not
 always as they appear.

745
00:43:49,867 --> 00:43:51,533
- You're right.

746
00:43:51,533 --> 00:43:54,467
(mysterious music)

747
00:44:23,933 --> 00:44:28,100
- On the other side of that
 bridge is Nightmare Hollow.

748
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,067
- The nether regions.

749
00:44:31,067 --> 00:44:32,467
- The evil place.

750
00:44:33,767 --> 00:44:37,767
- The epitomal image of
Dante's hellish inferno.

751
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,767
- Yeah so in other words
 we gotta watch our butts.

752
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:45,767
(suspenseful music)

753
00:46:35,433 --> 00:46:39,600
- [Porcini] That's it, that's
 it, come on now, that's it.

754
00:46:47,933 --> 00:46:49,867
Hurry up Josh, come on!

755
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:57,367
- Josh Kirby, run!

756
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:01,467
- Oh no!

757
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,133
- Come on, keep
 climbing, come on!

758
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,667
Don't let go.

759
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:24,667
Come on, that's it,
 you're doing good,

760
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:26,333
look at us, come on.

761
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,367
That's it Josh, come on.

762
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:31,367
Come on, boy!

763
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:32,367
Grab her hand!

764
00:47:32,367 --> 00:47:33,200
Come on.

765
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:37,467
Pull, pull!

766
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,533
That's it.

767
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:43,900
Come on everyone!

768
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:55,667
- Well, that always
looked fun on Nintendo.

769
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:57,533
- It was too close for comfort.

770
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:58,633
- I, I agree.

771
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,833
- You don't need to know
what a yabbadabba is

772
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:10,233
to know that Azabeth
 hasn't got much time.

773
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:13,067
- Look, Prism's sniffing
 another nullfier component.

774
00:48:13,067 --> 00:48:14,733
Can't be too far off.

775
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:18,300
- Neither can the Muncher.

776
00:48:19,767 --> 00:48:22,667
(mysterious music)

777
00:48:39,133 --> 00:48:42,233
- We are in the heart
of Nightmare Hollow now.

778
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:45,167
This is Muncher
 territory for sure.

779
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,467
- What makes you say that?

780
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,900
- I just feel it.

781
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,133
- The second code
 of Kang tells us

782
00:48:51,133 --> 00:48:55,333
a warrior must always
 trust his instincts.

783
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:57,433
- When did this Muncher
 monster begin to make its

784
00:48:57,433 --> 00:49:00,533
presence felt by
 you mushroom people?

785
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:04,367
- It seems like forever.

786
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:05,800
You don't measure things
the same like time

787
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,800
when you live so scared.

788
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,233
- Has anyone ever
 seen this Muncher?

789
00:49:12,233 --> 00:49:14,900
- No one who came back.

790
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,733
- [Dingdong] I saw it.

791
00:49:17,933 --> 00:49:21,067
- Dingadong, you saw the
Muncher take your daddy?

792
00:49:21,067 --> 00:49:22,800
Oh that's terrible.

793
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,100
- It all happened so fast.

794
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,733
I tried.

795
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:28,967
But I couldn't do anything.

796
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:32,200
I kept yelling for
 my dad to follow me

797
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,667
but it was like he was
in some sort of trance.

798
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:36,833
I felt it too.

799
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:42,200
I was practicing my ringing
 when it all came upon us.

800
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,733
That's how come I think I
 wasn't taken with the others.

801
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:45,667
- Hypnosis.

802
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:50,467
It must use hypnosis
 to attract its prey.

803
00:49:50,467 --> 00:49:53,233
- That must be why you
 were able to escape.

804
00:49:53,233 --> 00:49:55,867
If you were ringing, your
 mind must have been so full

805
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,333
of emotion that it
 couldn't be lured

806
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:59,067
into the Muncher's trap.

807
00:49:59,067 --> 00:50:00,667
- That's right.

808
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,100
You were so busy worrying
 about your father

809
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,467
you didn't have time
 to do anything else.

810
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:05,700
- Wow.

811
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,233
So my dad saved me?

812
00:50:07,233 --> 00:50:09,767
- In a manner of speaking, yes.

813
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:11,600
- But all I did was panic.

814
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,233
And cover myself with moss.

815
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:17,600
I don't know what
 happened after that.

816
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,433
It got real quiet and
then everybody was gone.

817
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,067
- You were very
 brave, young Dingdong.

818
00:50:32,433 --> 00:50:33,967
And you couldn't have
 done anything except

819
00:50:33,967 --> 00:50:36,267
get munched yourself.

820
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:38,967
But you behaved as
 a warrior and now

821
00:50:38,967 --> 00:50:41,467
you're prepared for the battle.

822
00:50:41,467 --> 00:50:42,600
- Warrior?

823
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,000
I'm no warrior.

824
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,200
All I did was hide and run away.

825
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,000
- He who fights
 and flees the fray

826
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,667
lives to fight another day.

827
00:50:52,667 --> 00:50:56,400
- By any chance would
that be a code of Kang?

828
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,067
- Number six.

829
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,733
(mysterious music)

830
00:51:17,833 --> 00:51:19,733
- Whoa, Josh.

831
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:21,533
You alright?

832
00:51:21,533 --> 00:51:22,367
- Yeah.

833
00:51:24,233 --> 00:51:28,067
I'm fine, I just
 tripped on something.

834
00:51:28,067 --> 00:51:30,067
- How big did you
 say this Muncher is?

835
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:33,067
- That's his footprints,
you figure it out.

836
00:51:33,067 --> 00:51:35,167
- Oh no, not a footprint.

837
00:51:36,567 --> 00:51:38,600
I've had quite enough of
 monster, giants, and mutants

838
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,867
for one lifetime,
 thank you very much.

839
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:42,467
(suspenseful music)

840
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:45,267
- Everybody, look at
 the furry one's hair!

841
00:51:45,267 --> 00:51:46,800
- Prism?

842
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,533
You've done it again!

843
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:53,500
- That's right, the
 Muncher must have stepped

844
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,200
on one of the
 nullifier components.

845
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,467
(chuckling)

846
00:51:57,467 --> 00:52:01,300
- [Irwin] Thank heaven
they're indestructible.

847
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,067
- I just noticed something.

848
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:06,133
Every time we pick one
 of these things up,

849
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:07,800
something go wrong.

850
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,167
It's like they are
jinxed or booby-trapped.

851
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:12,500
(pulsing tone)

852
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:15,133
- Porcini, that's
 absolute coincidence.

853
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:17,600
It's totally unscientific.

854
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,800
There's just no pattern here.

855
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,967
In due time you could
 establish a pattern

856
00:52:21,967 --> 00:52:24,567
but twice is mere coincidence.

857
00:52:24,567 --> 00:52:26,733
(buzzing)

858
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,833
What's that noise?

859
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:31,933
(growling)

860
00:52:31,933 --> 00:52:34,267
(screaming)

861
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:38,600
Don't look at its eyes!

862
00:52:42,067 --> 00:52:45,500
- Prepare to meet
 your maker, Muncher!

863
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,767
- No, Dingdong!

864
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:54,067
Azabeth, no, no,
 Azabeth, not you too.

865
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,767
Azabeth, Azabeth,
 no, Azabeth, no!

866
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:11,333
Azabeth, no!

867
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:15,467
(shouting)

868
00:53:15,467 --> 00:53:17,633
(hitting)

869
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,567
I know, we gotta
get to its eyes.

870
00:53:31,567 --> 00:53:32,867
It's the only way to
 make it powerless!

871
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:34,233
- Basta, wait a minute, boy!

872
00:53:34,233 --> 00:53:35,933
- Hold back, Joshua!

873
00:53:35,933 --> 00:53:38,733
You'll never reach
 up to its face.

874
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:41,067
(shushing)

875
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:49,167
(mysterious music)

876
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:50,167
(groaning)

877
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:52,433
- You think you're so smart.

878
00:53:52,433 --> 00:53:54,067
Eh, little shrooms?

879
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,667
- Who the heck are you?

880
00:53:58,667 --> 00:53:59,500
- Oh!

881
00:54:01,367 --> 00:54:05,067
(mumbles) Boy you nearly...

882
00:54:06,067 --> 00:54:08,067
You, how did you find me?

883
00:54:10,533 --> 00:54:13,300
- I'll ask the questions.

884
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,133
Game over.

885
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:19,067
What are you trying
 to pull anyway?

886
00:54:19,067 --> 00:54:20,300
Where is everyone, huh?

887
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:21,300
(shushing)

888
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,300
What have you done with them?

889
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,600
- Shh, I can explain everything.

890
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,467
Okay, take it easy young man.

891
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:30,300
You see, it's really
quite an amusing thing.

892
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,633
You see it's really
 quite amusing.

893
00:54:33,633 --> 00:54:36,067
- Over here, take
 a look at this.

894
00:54:36,067 --> 00:54:37,700
- What have we here?

895
00:54:39,933 --> 00:54:41,433
- Oh, ha!

896
00:54:41,433 --> 00:54:43,567
Allow me to introduce myself.

897
00:54:43,567 --> 00:54:46,333
I am Colonel
 Beauregard T. Damon.

898
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:52,367
Colonel Beauregard T. Damon.

899
00:54:53,767 --> 00:54:57,667
Master shop, intergalactic
 entrepreneur,

900
00:54:57,667 --> 00:55:01,167
voyager, inventor, and
 patron of the arts.

901
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:09,533
And you are?

902
00:55:11,567 --> 00:55:13,500
- It's ingenious.

903
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,433
This Muncher is actually
 an incredibly sophisticated

904
00:55:18,433 --> 00:55:20,500
animatronic puppet?

905
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,167
- Yes, yes!

906
00:55:22,167 --> 00:55:25,267
It's a creation of
 my own, in fact.

907
00:55:25,267 --> 00:55:29,700
It's quite effective in
trapping alien species.

908
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,700
- Hang on little Dingadong!

909
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,867
I'm on my way!

910
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:35,600
- Look.

911
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:39,967
Those alien species
 are our friends.

912
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:40,800
- Oh.

913
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,567
You see, everybody's fine.

914
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:11,067
- Who's this guy?

915
00:56:12,533 --> 00:56:14,533
- This is Colonel Damon.

916
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,067
He built this thing.

917
00:56:18,067 --> 00:56:20,233
(rumbling)

918
00:56:21,633 --> 00:56:24,400
- The Muncher isn't a monster,
 it's a mechanical puppet.

919
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,733
- Yeah, we figured that out.

920
00:56:27,933 --> 00:56:30,433
- Hey, where's my
 dad and the others?

921
00:56:30,433 --> 00:56:32,267
- Yeah, where is everyone?

922
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:34,433
We're looking for a shroom
called Puffball and we need him

923
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:35,900
right now.

924
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,300
- Well I will take you to them.

925
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,400
It's not far.

926
00:56:42,567 --> 00:56:44,700
Mind your heads.

927
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,600
(mysterious music)

928
00:57:07,567 --> 00:57:09,067
Won't be long now.

929
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,067
- What are you collecting
these alien species for anyway?

930
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:14,067
(beeps)

931
00:57:14,067 --> 00:57:14,833
Pets?

932
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:16,067
Slaves?

933
00:57:16,067 --> 00:57:18,400
- My stars, no,
 nothing so primitive.

934
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,567
No, see I feature the natural
 wonders of the universe

935
00:57:24,067 --> 00:57:27,067
in my very own
 intergalactic circus.

936
00:57:28,633 --> 00:57:29,467
Ha!

937
00:57:31,100 --> 00:57:32,767
- Oh, an intergalactic circus.

938
00:57:32,767 --> 00:57:35,233
- Yes, yeah well it's
 my primary venture

939
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:37,600
into the world of
 entertainment, presently.

940
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,933
I travel the cosmos in
 my little chuck wagon

941
00:57:40,933 --> 00:57:45,100
collecting various creatures
 and bringing them together

942
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:47,333
under one tent!

943
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:50,433
- So it's like a freak show!

944
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:51,433
- Yes!

945
00:57:51,433 --> 00:57:52,333
No, no, no.

946
00:57:54,133 --> 00:57:55,300
Hello, youth.

947
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,567
No see my big top
travels from one planet

948
00:57:57,567 --> 00:57:59,633
to the next, educating.

949
00:57:59,633 --> 00:58:00,733
E-D-U-C-A-T--

950
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:03,633
- I-N-G.

951
00:58:03,633 --> 00:58:06,800
- I-N-G, right,
educating alien cultures

952
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,967
as to the vast variety, the
 possibilities of nature.

953
00:58:14,433 --> 00:58:15,267
Yeah.

954
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:19,267
- So where are you from?

955
00:58:19,267 --> 00:58:21,500
- Well, well I've planted myself

956
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,067
in every corner of the
 universe at one time

957
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:28,200
or another, but I was born
 in the United Federation

958
00:58:29,233 --> 00:58:30,967
of American Colonies.

959
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:35,900
- You mean the United
 States of America.

960
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,900
- What?

961
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:37,733
The USA?

962
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:43,633
That's ancient history, son.

963
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:46,833
What time machine
 did you step out of?

964
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:48,400
Next thing you're gonna tell me

965
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,567
is that you've never heard
 of the talking ape era

966
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:53,067
of the 21st century.

967
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:54,900
(laughing)

968
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,233
- Oh no, I've heard of that.

969
00:59:07,967 --> 00:59:09,233
- Come come come!

970
00:59:09,233 --> 00:59:12,067
(clapping)

971
00:59:12,067 --> 00:59:15,467
I think you'll find
 this quite relieving.

972
00:59:22,533 --> 00:59:25,433
(mysterious music)

973
00:59:33,167 --> 00:59:36,567
(whimsical circus music)

974
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,667
(beeps)

975
00:59:55,433 --> 00:59:56,700
- Oh, daylight!

976
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,300
Oh am I glad to see you.

977
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:02,167
What are you doing here?

978
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:05,567
- Center of most worlds
I've been to harbor

979
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:07,700
an internal sun.

980
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:10,133
Jules Verne was right.

981
01:00:10,133 --> 01:00:12,133
- Azabeth, are you okay?

982
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:17,733
(suspenseful music)

983
01:00:17,733 --> 01:00:19,600
No, it can't be too late.

984
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:20,967
There's still some sand left.

985
01:00:20,967 --> 01:00:23,833
- Every estimate has a
 margin of error, Josh.

986
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:24,767
- Josh, I--

987
01:00:27,767 --> 01:00:31,467
- [Irwin] She's slipping
rather quickly, Josh.

988
01:00:31,467 --> 01:00:32,467
- Where's Puffball?

989
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:33,933
Where is he?

990
01:00:33,933 --> 01:00:34,933
- He's in there.

991
01:00:34,933 --> 01:00:36,333
- Bring him here, quick!

992
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:37,167
Hurry!

993
01:00:45,467 --> 01:00:48,067
Azabeth, Azabeth, wake up.

994
01:00:48,067 --> 01:00:50,900
Don't fall asleep,
 you'll be okay.

995
01:01:03,467 --> 01:01:04,700
(ringing)

996
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,533
- Pops!

997
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:08,667
- Hello son.

998
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:10,533
How are you?

999
01:01:13,567 --> 01:01:15,667
- Azabeth, Azabeth!

1000
01:01:15,667 --> 01:01:19,367
We're here, look,
 Puffball's right here.

1001
01:01:19,367 --> 01:01:20,367
Azabeth, no.

1002
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:29,200
- I'm afraid it's too late.

1003
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,900
She's slipped into a
 terminal deep sleep

1004
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,833
just like Dr. Shiitake
 said she might.

1005
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:36,067
- On behalf of all of
 the mushrooms, Josh,

1006
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,533
I want to say that
 we are so sorry

1007
01:01:37,533 --> 01:01:40,600
that we are the
 cause of your sorrow.

1008
01:01:47,067 --> 01:01:47,833
- No.

1009
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,400
No, we've got to do something!

1010
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,500
Look, you say you're the
 smartest man in the universe,

1011
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,200
so just do something!

1012
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,967
- Sorry Josh, there's some
 problems even I can't solve.

1013
01:01:57,967 --> 01:02:00,633
If I could alter the
 situation, I would.

1014
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,533
I'm just a scientist,
 not a magician.

1015
01:02:02,533 --> 01:02:04,667
I can't perform miracles.

1016
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:06,467
- I don't need a miracle.

1017
01:02:06,467 --> 01:02:08,900
All I need is a few minutes!

1018
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:13,067
They were taken from me
 and I'm gonna get 'em back.

1019
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:16,400
Just a few minutes.

1020
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,567
All I need is a few minutes.

1021
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:20,833
Just five minutes, come on.

1022
01:02:22,067 --> 01:02:24,800
(exciting music)

1023
01:02:34,933 --> 01:02:37,100
(buzzing)

1024
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,200
Five minutes.

1025
01:02:43,067 --> 01:02:43,900
- Josh!

1026
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,067
Josh, what in the name
of the supreme prefect?

1027
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:53,367
Great jumping ions!

1028
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:58,600
You're summoning up
 your own time storm!

1029
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:00,067
Josh, be careful!

1030
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,867
- Five minutes.

1031
01:03:05,767 --> 01:03:06,867
Five minutes.

1032
01:03:31,567 --> 01:03:34,400
- [Porcini] Josh,
 Puffball, hurry!

1033
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,333
- That tastes terrible.

1034
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:04,367
- It's okay Azabeth, medicine's
supposed to taste bad.

1035
01:04:08,467 --> 01:04:11,733
- What are you trying
 to do, poison me?

1036
01:04:21,767 --> 01:04:25,867
- Just now, I was somehow
 able to turn back time.

1037
01:04:28,933 --> 01:04:29,767
- What?

1038
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:34,300
No one's ever been able to
 create a time storm before

1039
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,867
without using a
 chronal displacement
 device of some sort.

1040
01:04:37,867 --> 01:04:39,433
- Yeah, well I did.

1041
01:04:41,267 --> 01:04:43,200
I mean, Azabeth was
 almost out of time,

1042
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,767
I had to do something.

1043
01:04:45,767 --> 01:04:47,333
- You did it!

1044
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:48,167
It worked!

1045
01:04:50,067 --> 01:04:50,833
- Yeah.

1046
01:04:55,667 --> 01:04:57,467
- Stupefying.

1047
01:04:57,467 --> 01:05:00,100
(bright music)

1048
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,533
- It's humble but it's mine.

1049
01:05:21,267 --> 01:05:23,500
(groaning)

1050
01:05:33,733 --> 01:05:34,567
- Irwin.

1051
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,133
Zoetrope.

1052
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,533
- He doesn't seem
 to recognize us.

1053
01:05:53,067 --> 01:05:55,500
Anything else for that matter.

1054
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:03,267
- (speaking foreign language)

1055
01:06:03,267 --> 01:06:04,633
It's me!

1056
01:06:04,633 --> 01:06:06,233
Chantarelle!

1057
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:07,733
Speak to me!

1058
01:06:07,733 --> 01:06:09,433
What's wrong with you all?

1059
01:06:09,433 --> 01:06:10,833
- They cannot hear you.

1060
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:14,833
See they respond to only
me and my instructions.

1061
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:16,067
(ominous music)

1062
01:06:16,067 --> 01:06:17,833
I am so glad you've
 provided me with

1063
01:06:17,833 --> 01:06:20,667
this opportunity to have
you join their ranks.

1064
01:06:20,667 --> 01:06:22,567
- What a dirty, rotten--

1065
01:06:22,567 --> 01:06:23,833
- Sticks and stones
 may break my bones

1066
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:26,600
but names really tick me off.

1067
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,067
(laser firing)

1068
01:06:29,067 --> 01:06:29,833
- Porcini!

1069
01:06:31,267 --> 01:06:34,600
- What did you do to my dad
 you mad, mad circus freak?

1070
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,067
(laser firing)

1071
01:06:37,067 --> 01:06:39,300
(groaning)

1072
01:06:42,267 --> 01:06:43,933
- Don't worry, don't worry.

1073
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:47,200
I'm only interested in
mushrooms for my circus.

1074
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,067
Besides, I've only stunned them.

1075
01:06:50,067 --> 01:06:52,467
Once I reprogram their minds,

1076
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:54,500
they'll fit right
 in with the others.

1077
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,400
- You are nothing but
 a coward and a phony.

1078
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,100
First you hide behind
 your mechanical rat

1079
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,700
and now you try and hide
behind your blaster.

1080
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:07,867
- Young lady, you are really
 beginning to try my patience.

1081
01:07:10,633 --> 01:07:14,800
- Colonel, couldn't we come
 to some sort of arrangement?

1082
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,133
- Hmm.

1083
01:07:20,533 --> 01:07:23,067
Well, your furry little
ward there would make

1084
01:07:23,067 --> 01:07:25,467
a most excellent attraction.

1085
01:07:25,467 --> 01:07:27,467
Never seen a species like him.

1086
01:07:27,467 --> 01:07:29,300
Yes, yes, bravo I say!

1087
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,800
Bravissimo, bravace, alright!

1088
01:07:33,933 --> 01:07:35,467
Hand him over.

1089
01:07:35,467 --> 01:07:37,100
- That's impossible.

1090
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,467
We haven't finished collecting

1091
01:07:38,467 --> 01:07:39,800
all the nullifier components.

1092
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,633
But I can fully
appreciate your interest

1093
01:07:42,633 --> 01:07:43,967
in my little friend.

1094
01:07:43,967 --> 01:07:47,800
Perhaps when he's
fulfilled his function.

1095
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,267
- Irwin, you're kidding, right?

1096
01:07:49,267 --> 01:07:52,333
- Well, it's a shroom
show this season anyway.

1097
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:55,267
Too late to introduce
 a new attraction now.

1098
01:07:55,267 --> 01:07:57,267
I can't believe my luck.

1099
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:02,633
This one here make a most
 excellent strong man.

1100
01:08:02,633 --> 01:08:05,967
Golly gosh, now I will
 have a father and son

1101
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:07,700
dinging act.

1102
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:11,200
(mimicking bells ringing)

1103
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:17,367
(curious music)

1104
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:28,100
- Fourth and fifth
 nullifier components.

1105
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:34,467
- Into, into the
 cage with them, boys!

1106
01:08:35,867 --> 01:08:38,233
- I demand that you set these
 shrooms free immediately.

1107
01:08:38,233 --> 01:08:40,167
You have no right to
 keep them in bondage.

1108
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:42,600
I have spent my entire
life fighting this very

1109
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:46,067
kind of slavery on my own
 planet and it makes me sick!

1110
01:08:46,067 --> 01:08:48,167
(kicks)

1111
01:08:48,167 --> 01:08:49,067
- My hand!

1112
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:54,133
You little hussy.

1113
01:08:54,133 --> 01:08:56,067
- Set them free, Colonel.

1114
01:08:56,067 --> 01:08:58,900
Or I'll zap you into a
 state of unconsciousness.

1115
01:08:58,900 --> 01:08:59,900
- Oh, pshaw.

1116
01:09:01,067 --> 01:09:03,300
- Break the spell, Colonel.

1117
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,833
- You shoot me and
 your fungal friends

1118
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:10,767
will spend their days
in a state of catatonia.

1119
01:09:10,767 --> 01:09:13,700
And you'll never be able
to de-hypnotize them.

1120
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:14,733
- Oh yeah?

1121
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:16,733
I'll think of something.

1122
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:19,767
- Go ahead then.

1123
01:09:19,767 --> 01:09:20,600
Shoot.

1124
01:09:22,733 --> 01:09:24,400
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

1125
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:27,233
(buzzing)

1126
01:09:27,233 --> 01:09:29,233
- Oh darn, I forgot to tell you.

1127
01:09:29,233 --> 01:09:31,133
The plasma blaster's
 grip is programmed

1128
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:34,200
to respond only to
 my hand print, oh!

1129
01:09:42,767 --> 01:09:44,167
I've been robbed.

1130
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,067
You, ugly!

1131
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:53,567
You, you, you!

1132
01:09:53,567 --> 01:09:55,367
Block the exits!

1133
01:09:55,367 --> 01:09:57,067
Nobody gets out!

1134
01:09:57,067 --> 01:10:00,067
(mysterious music)

1135
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,733
(chanting)

1136
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,833
- Where's Irwin?

1137
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,433
- Return my property,
thieving septuagenarian.

1138
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,900
You have no choice
 but to surrender, sir.

1139
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,100
My troops have you surrounded.

1140
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,033
- It's you who have robbed me.

1141
01:10:23,033 --> 01:10:25,900
These are the objects I
 have risked life and limb

1142
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:29,933
to find and I won't be
 waylaid by the likes of you.

1143
01:10:29,933 --> 01:10:32,167
- Tough toenails!

1144
01:10:32,167 --> 01:10:36,400
Sir, they are mine now
to show to the universe.

1145
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,400
- Colonel, if we don't
 get all those pieces

1146
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,100
there won't be any universe.

1147
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:43,467
- Oh, what's that
 supposed to mean?

1148
01:10:43,467 --> 01:10:46,167
- I won't return them, Colonel.

1149
01:10:46,167 --> 01:10:48,600
- Well, in that case
 I guess it's pointless

1150
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,833
to argue with you.

1151
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:51,667
- Oh.

1152
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:57,500
I knew at heart you were
 a reasonable human being.

1153
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,700
- I just have to
 shoot you instead.

1154
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:04,833
(intense music)
(laser firing)

1155
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:13,633
- Must make haste.

1156
01:11:13,633 --> 01:11:15,800
- [Crowd] No one gets out.

1157
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,433
- What about
 Dingdong and Porcini?

1158
01:11:18,433 --> 01:11:21,167
- We can't just
 leave them there.

1159
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,433
- Irwin, what do we do?

1160
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:30,933
- Never having been surrounded
 by zombie mushrooms before,

1161
01:11:30,933 --> 01:11:32,167
I have no idea.

1162
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,067
- Oh!

1163
01:11:40,533 --> 01:11:42,800
- Pop, it's me, Dingdong!

1164
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,300
What are you doing?

1165
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,700
These are my friends!

1166
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,600
Please, snap out of it!

1167
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:58,100
(chirping)

1168
01:11:59,733 --> 01:12:02,167
- It's the furry one!

1169
01:12:02,167 --> 01:12:05,467
- [Mushrooms] We pledge our
 undying loyalty oh furry one.

1170
01:12:05,467 --> 01:12:07,067
- Prism's colors are bringing
 them out of hypnosis.

1171
01:12:07,067 --> 01:12:10,967
- [Mushrooms] We pledge our
 undying loyalty oh furry one.

1172
01:12:10,967 --> 01:12:14,567
We pledge our undying
 loyalty oh furry one.

1173
01:12:15,767 --> 01:12:19,267
We pledge our undying
 loyalty oh furry one.

1174
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:23,400
(mystical music)

1175
01:12:39,767 --> 01:12:42,933
- We told you the
 furry one was great.

1176
01:12:54,067 --> 01:12:54,833
- Pops!

1177
01:12:56,067 --> 01:12:58,300
(ringing)

1178
01:12:58,300 --> 01:12:59,600
- Ding!

1179
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,467
Oh my boy!

1180
01:13:04,833 --> 01:13:09,067
- Irwin, how could you even
 consider trading Prism away?

1181
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:14,733
- Josh, Colonel Damon is a
 traveler to distant galaxies.

1182
01:13:14,733 --> 01:13:16,300
With him, Prism has
 a much better chance

1183
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:19,133
of getting back
 to his own planet.

1184
01:13:20,333 --> 01:13:22,467
- Well yeah, I never
thought of it that way.

1185
01:13:22,467 --> 01:13:24,167
- It's a good thing we now know

1186
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:27,100
what a lowly worm-gutted
villain Colonel Damon really is.

1187
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:27,933
- Ahem.

1188
01:13:29,467 --> 01:13:30,800
He can hear you.

1189
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,633
Put them back in the cages.

1190
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,200
What have you done?

1191
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:47,067
- Your slaver days
 are over, Damon.

1192
01:13:47,067 --> 01:13:48,867
- My talent.

1193
01:13:48,867 --> 01:13:51,100
You've deprogrammed them.

1194
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:53,067
Months of work, ruined.

1195
01:13:55,067 --> 01:13:55,900
Okay.

1196
01:13:59,367 --> 01:14:03,100
- You torture your
 last shroom, paisan.

1197
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,633
You're gonna go on
 your space rocket

1198
01:14:05,633 --> 01:14:07,800
and you're gonna bring
 back all the shrooms

1199
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,967
you kidnapped.

1200
01:14:10,233 --> 01:14:12,567
We go with you to make sure.

1201
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:18,100
- I will return all
 your people to you.

1202
01:14:20,233 --> 01:14:24,400
Think I wanted to resort to
 violence and mind control?

1203
01:14:26,067 --> 01:14:29,500
- You're power hungry,
Colonel, it's a disease.

1204
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,067
Believe me, I know.

1205
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,767
- Okay, okay, so I made some
 faulty management decisions.

1206
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,400
My entertainment empire
spans the universe.

1207
01:14:48,133 --> 01:14:52,300
All I ever wanted to do was
 bring the mysteries of nature

1208
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,800
to the underprivileged
 youngsters of the cosmos.

1209
01:15:00,733 --> 01:15:02,233
Was that so wrong?

1210
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,200
Mommy!

1211
01:15:14,733 --> 01:15:17,167
- It doesn't sound
 like such a bad life.

1212
01:15:17,167 --> 01:15:19,733
Traveling around the cosmos.

1213
01:15:19,733 --> 01:15:21,700
- Hey, how do you know?

1214
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:24,067
You never even
 been above ground.

1215
01:15:24,067 --> 01:15:25,300
None of us have.

1216
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,100
- That's just what I'm saying.

1217
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,167
It could be a great adventure.

1218
01:15:29,167 --> 01:15:31,667
To explore strange new worlds.

1219
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,267
To seek out new life,

1220
01:15:34,267 --> 01:15:36,933
new civilizations, to
 boldly go where no shroom

1221
01:15:36,933 --> 01:15:38,267
has gone before.

1222
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,933
- It's an exciting life,
that's for certain.

1223
01:15:43,933 --> 01:15:45,533
- I'm thinking about going.

1224
01:15:45,533 --> 01:15:47,067
- Me too.

1225
01:15:47,067 --> 01:15:48,400
- But he will exploit
 you, treat you as slaves,

1226
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,600
imprison you.

1227
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,433
- Yeah.

1228
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:56,100
But they wouldn't be
 slaves if they were paid.

1229
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:57,733
- Profit sharing?

1230
01:15:57,733 --> 01:15:59,233
Never.

1231
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:02,733
- You must not let this
 scoundrel take advantage!

1232
01:16:02,733 --> 01:16:04,433
(dramatic music)

1233
01:16:04,433 --> 01:16:07,333
If you fail to give the
shrooms a fair deal,

1234
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:10,267
Damon, I will
personally hunt you down

1235
01:16:10,267 --> 01:16:13,067
and take their percentage
 from your worthless hide.

1236
01:16:13,067 --> 01:16:15,133
As the 20th code
of Kang ordains,

1237
01:16:15,133 --> 01:16:18,133
blood debts must
 be repaid in blood.

1238
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:20,633
- Blood?

1239
01:16:22,067 --> 01:16:24,533
- Azabeth, is that really
 the 20th code of Kang?

1240
01:16:24,533 --> 01:16:26,067
- Of course it is.

1241
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,767
- I agree, I agree!

1242
01:16:29,933 --> 01:16:32,767
I will negotiate,
 just don't hurt me.

1243
01:16:39,367 --> 01:16:40,633
- Alright then.

1244
01:16:41,933 --> 01:16:43,067
It's settled.

1245
01:16:43,067 --> 01:16:44,633
Badabing, badaboom.

1246
01:16:51,067 --> 01:16:52,867
- What about Zoetrope?

1247
01:16:52,867 --> 01:16:54,800
- Oh yes, Dr. Zoetrope.

1248
01:16:56,267 --> 01:16:59,233
He must still be under
 the spell of the Muncher.

1249
01:16:59,233 --> 01:17:03,233
Lucky for us the Colonel
doesn't know who he is.

1250
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:08,500
- Ah, well Colonel,
 what are you planning

1251
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:11,167
on doing with that
 big guy over there?

1252
01:17:11,167 --> 01:17:12,300
- The rove rover?

1253
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:13,467
- [Josh] Yeah.

1254
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:17,367
- Caught him just
today in the catacombs.

1255
01:17:17,367 --> 01:17:20,367
Put up quite a fight,
 nearly crunched my Muncher.

1256
01:17:20,367 --> 01:17:22,833
Robots are yesterday's news
 most places these days.

1257
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:26,533
But trade him to a
 robot wrestling team

1258
01:17:26,533 --> 01:17:29,067
for Maldorphian red pod.

1259
01:17:29,067 --> 01:17:31,233
- A robot wrestling team, huh?

1260
01:17:31,233 --> 01:17:32,833
That's pretty cool.

1261
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,733
(light music)

1262
01:17:36,733 --> 01:17:41,233
- I just wanted to thank
 you for helping our people.

1263
01:17:41,233 --> 01:17:43,967
And for reuniting
 me with my boy.

1264
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:47,567
- And you should be
 especially proud of your son,

1265
01:17:47,567 --> 01:17:49,267
Mr. Puffball.

1266
01:17:49,267 --> 01:17:51,300
We would have been
 lost without him.

1267
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,667
Young Dingdong is a very
 brave and resourceful warrior.

1268
01:17:54,667 --> 01:17:57,667
- I can't wait to tell the
kids about the stinger attacks.

1269
01:17:57,667 --> 01:18:01,533
The quicksand and
 fighting with the Muncher!

1270
01:18:01,533 --> 01:18:04,633
And about this beautiful
cool warrior girl

1271
01:18:04,633 --> 01:18:08,800
who taught me all about life
 and the 21 codes of Kang.

1272
01:18:09,933 --> 01:18:11,900
- Whoa, wait a second!

1273
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:16,067
Maybe you should tell
your old man first, huh?

1274
01:18:16,067 --> 01:18:17,067
(giggles)

1275
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:18,967
- Maybe when you get older, Pop.

1276
01:18:18,967 --> 01:18:20,900
(laughing)

1277
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,833
Goodbye, Azabeth Siege.

1278
01:18:24,267 --> 01:18:28,300
I don't know if I'll ever
 meet anyone like you again.

1279
01:18:30,767 --> 01:18:32,267
(grand music)

1280
01:18:32,267 --> 01:18:35,433
- And I know I will never
 meet another mushroom warrior

1281
01:18:35,433 --> 01:18:38,533
as brave as you, young Dingdong.

1282
01:18:38,533 --> 01:18:42,700
- I'm no good at
 saying goodbyes, so we
 just say ciao, okay?

1283
01:18:45,133 --> 01:18:46,300
- Ciao.

1284
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,133
- Yes indeed, Porcini.

1285
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,867
- And you too furry one.

1286
01:18:52,867 --> 01:18:56,600
I would be honored if
I could shake your paw.

1287
01:18:57,667 --> 01:18:59,133
(chirps)

1288
01:18:59,133 --> 01:19:01,900
(exciting music)

1289
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,700
I'll never wash this hand again.

1290
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,367
(laughing)

1291
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:24,933
(gentle music)

1292
01:19:41,433 --> 01:19:43,700
- How do we find
 the last components,

1293
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:45,600
and what do we do then?

1294
01:19:47,067 --> 01:19:50,633
- Then the universe is
 saved and I'll restore you

1295
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,233
and Azabeth back to
 your respective times.

1296
01:19:56,733 --> 01:19:58,833
Return to mine a demigod.

1297
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,667
- What if you can't do it?

1298
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,033
I mean bring us back, that is.

1299
01:20:08,033 --> 01:20:10,867
- Oh don't worry,
 I'll find a way.

1300
01:20:12,633 --> 01:20:14,733
Or perhaps even you will.

1301
01:20:16,467 --> 01:20:17,300
Josh.

1302
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:24,467
When you used your
 time warrior powers

1303
01:20:24,467 --> 01:20:27,567
to summon up a
 one-person time storm.

1304
01:20:28,733 --> 01:20:31,500
How did you know
you could do it?

1305
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:37,100
Did you just feel it innately?

1306
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:42,133
- Well at the moment it
was all I wanted to do.

1307
01:20:43,367 --> 01:20:44,633
It was like I knew
 what had to happen

1308
01:20:44,633 --> 01:20:47,367
and I knew I had
 to make it happen.

1309
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,400
Now look, this may sound crazy,

1310
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,400
but I knew I could do it.

1311
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,400
I just knew.

1312
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,433
I guess when someone really
 wants to change something

1313
01:20:59,433 --> 01:21:01,867
they find the power
 to make it happen.

1314
01:21:01,867 --> 01:21:04,967
Of course, that's
 not always true.

1315
01:21:04,967 --> 01:21:08,233
Some things nobody can change.

1316
01:21:08,233 --> 01:21:12,500
I guess that's the way
 it's supposed to be.

1317
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:15,167
- Yes, it's very sensible, Josh.

1318
01:21:17,067 --> 01:21:20,200
You have a good head
 on your shoulders.

1319
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,067
- Thanks.

1320
01:21:23,867 --> 01:21:25,367
- Goodnight, Josh.

1321
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,500
- Goodnight, Irwin.

1322
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:34,600
(gentle snoring)

1323
01:21:37,667 --> 01:21:40,667
(sentimental music)

1324
01:22:45,267 --> 01:22:47,933
(buzzing)

1325
01:22:47,933 --> 01:22:49,600
- No, no, not again!

1326
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:54,800
(dramatic music)

1327
01:23:06,867 --> 01:23:09,067
(zapping)

1328
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,433
Zoetrope!

1329
01:23:19,133 --> 01:23:21,967
- Toss me the
 nullifying component.

1330
01:23:21,967 --> 01:23:22,967
- No, never!

1331
01:23:26,133 --> 01:23:26,967
Whoa!

1332
01:23:28,267 --> 01:23:30,600
- Josh, it's too heavy, Josh.

1333
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:31,967
It's weighing you down, Josh.

1334
01:23:31,967 --> 01:23:36,800
Toss me the nullifying
component so I can pull you up.

1335
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,733
- No, I'd rather see it lost
 forever then in your hands!

1336
01:23:39,733 --> 01:23:42,067
- Listen to me, Joshua.

1337
01:23:42,067 --> 01:23:44,333
If you drop the
nullifying component
you will most certainly

1338
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:47,067
doom the future of all mankind.

1339
01:23:47,067 --> 01:23:50,200
You may as well take
 a chance with me.

1340
01:23:57,267 --> 01:24:00,067
(zaps)

1341
01:24:00,067 --> 01:24:03,467
(dramatic music)

1342
01:24:03,467 --> 01:24:05,567
(shouts)

1343
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:24,500
- I'm warning you, Dr. Zoetrope.

1344
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,400
I've got powers too.

1345
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:31,333
Special, special time warrior
 powers that you can't handle.

1346
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:32,900
I can bend time
 without a tin suit.

1347
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:36,700
- Then use those powers
 to finally see the truth.

1348
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:40,433
Irwin 1138's been
 manipulating you all along.

1349
01:24:40,433 --> 01:24:43,067
- Your evil lies make me sick!

1350
01:24:43,067 --> 01:24:44,167
We both know Irwin's
 been trying to save

1351
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:45,933
the universe from you.

1352
01:24:45,933 --> 01:24:47,600
- No Joshua.

1353
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,067
He's tricked you
 into believing that

1354
01:24:49,067 --> 01:24:51,367
when it's been he who wants
 to destroy the future.

1355
01:24:51,367 --> 01:24:53,133
- You're insane!

1356
01:24:53,133 --> 01:24:54,500
You've been doing
everything in your power

1357
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,733
to try and crush us!

1358
01:24:56,733 --> 01:25:00,067
- Is that why I saved
 your life just now?

1359
01:25:00,067 --> 01:25:03,367
If you still don't believe
 me, Josh, go ahead.

1360
01:25:03,367 --> 01:25:07,667
Touch your fingers to my
 head and time probe my mind.

1361
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:08,933
- What do you mean?

1362
01:25:08,933 --> 01:25:10,700
- Pull the past
 from out of my mind.

1363
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:11,767
You can do it.

1364
01:25:11,767 --> 01:25:14,100
You're a time warrior, Josh.

1365
01:25:15,933 --> 01:25:18,933
(suspenseful music)

1366
01:25:25,333 --> 01:25:27,233
(zaps)

1367
01:25:29,367 --> 01:25:31,733
- I was able to recalibrate
 Colonel Damon's blaster

1368
01:25:31,733 --> 01:25:33,633
to match my own pawprint.

1369
01:25:33,633 --> 01:25:35,167
Are you alright, Josh?

1370
01:25:35,167 --> 01:25:37,167
- Yeah, I'm fine, but you
 didn't have to shoot him!

1371
01:25:37,167 --> 01:25:39,267
- Ah, forget his evil lies.

1372
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:41,200
Trying to turn you
against me is child play

1373
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:43,533
for an evil genius like him.

1374
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:45,533
- Irwin?

1375
01:25:46,467 --> 01:25:49,133
Let me probe your time memories.

1376
01:25:51,433 --> 01:25:52,933
- Never!

1377
01:25:52,933 --> 01:25:55,600
(intense music)

1378
01:25:58,633 --> 01:26:02,500
Hand over the final
 nullifying component now Josh!

1379
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:03,500
- No.

1380
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,067
No not until I know the truth!

1381
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:10,433
- Please, Josh.

1382
01:26:12,467 --> 01:26:14,800
After all we've been
 through together,

1383
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,367
don't force me to blast
you to smithereens!

1384
01:26:22,867 --> 01:26:25,533
(warping music)

1385
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:32,867
- [Narrator] On the next chapter
of Josh Kirby Time Warrior!

1386
01:26:32,867 --> 01:26:35,167
- He's no one's friend, Josh!

1387
01:26:35,167 --> 01:26:36,500
- Quiet, you!

1388
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,500
(blasts)

1389
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:38,700
- [Josh] Dr. Zoetrope!

1390
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:39,567
- Hand the final
 nullifying component

1391
01:26:39,567 --> 01:26:40,567
over to me now.

1392
01:26:40,567 --> 01:26:43,067
Before I disintegrate Azabeth!

1393
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:46,500
(zapping)

1394
01:26:47,933 --> 01:26:49,533
- Irwin, come back!

1395
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:54,767
- I've won, I've won, I've won!

1396
01:26:57,433 --> 01:26:58,867
- Without a time travel
device we're stuck here

1397
01:26:58,867 --> 01:27:01,200
in the center of the earth,
 powerless to stop him.

1398
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:02,933
- But there must be
 something we can do.

1399
01:27:02,933 --> 01:27:04,633
A warrior can't just give up.

1400
01:27:04,633 --> 01:27:07,800
(laughing maniacally)

1401
01:27:09,733 --> 01:27:11,667
- You said it yourself.

1402
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,433
I'm a time warrior.

1403
01:27:14,433 --> 01:27:16,600
(buzzing)

1404
01:27:18,267 --> 01:27:19,500
- It's working!

1405
01:27:21,633 --> 01:27:22,567
- I got it!

1406
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:27,733
- I knew you could
 do it, Josh Kirby!

1407
01:27:27,733 --> 01:27:30,800
What in the name
of Kang is that?

1408
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,133
- It's an energy distortion
 of the time stream.

1409
01:27:33,133 --> 01:27:34,167
A time wave.

1410
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:35,467
- Look out!

1411
01:27:35,467 --> 01:27:37,800
(screaming)

1412
01:27:51,467 --> 01:27:52,467
- We did it!

1413
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,233
This is it!

1414
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,067
- I did it!

1415
01:27:58,067 --> 01:27:58,833
I'm back!

1416
01:28:00,667 --> 01:28:02,533
- We are still in
 the 20th century.

1417
01:28:02,533 --> 01:28:04,700
But we're six inches tall.

1418
01:28:05,767 --> 01:28:07,167
Well, I gotta go.

1419
01:28:10,267 --> 01:28:13,333
I've gotta try and
 save the universe.

1420
01:28:15,233 --> 01:28:17,733
- My friends are all
 gone thanks to you.

1421
01:28:17,733 --> 01:28:18,900
- Good riddance.

1422
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,433
