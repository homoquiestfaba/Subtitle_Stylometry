When you realize
that life is bigger than you.

535
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:40,224
- You grow when you see...

PROFESSOR ROCHESTER: Mr. Camp.

537
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,257
Hmm? Yes?

538
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:44,259
You wanna come back to Earth?

539
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:47,490
Honestly, not really.

Aw.

542
00:32:50,492 --> 00:32:52,224
You got a little girlfriend?

543
00:32:52,226 --> 00:32:55,424
So cute. No, really.
It's really, really cute.

544
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:56,890
- All right, you guys...
- (MOUTHING) Sorry.

What's this?

547
00:33:02,825 --> 00:33:04,557
Right now,
it's just a blank tape.

548
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,224
MELISSA: Mmm-mmm.
Tapes have soul.

549
00:33:06,226 --> 00:33:07,990
Why are you
giving this to me?

550
00:33:07,992 --> 00:33:10,957
Well, our record label's
paying for a new album.

551
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:13,123
So I called the engineer.
He's a friend of mine.

552
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,257
If we hustle, we'll have
an extra couple of hours.

553
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,790
I can get you in there,
and we can turn that into your demo.

554
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:20,557
- No.
- Two songs, maybe three.

555
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,157
I'll send it off
to some producers.

556
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,092
I don't know what to say.
Are you serious?

557
00:33:24,526 --> 00:33:25,957
Yeah.

- Yeah.
- Oh, no. I don't need to go...

No, no, no. Forget that.

Forget that.
I want you there.

like to play for you.

- see you later?
- Yeah.

- Yep. Bye.
- JEREMY: Bye.

574
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,426
You were out there
for a long time.

575
00:34:02,825 --> 00:34:03,992
Did he ask you out?

576
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:05,925
Sort of.

577
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:08,357
Okay. And?

578
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:09,990
Doesn't this all
just bother you?

579
00:34:09,992 --> 00:34:11,457
Yeah, of course
it bothers me, Melissa.

580
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:12,524
You should just tell him.

581
00:34:12,526 --> 00:34:14,959
I can't tell him. I...

582
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:19,426
Are you wearing his jacket?

00:34:21,992 --> 00:34:22,992
Yeah.

You're wearing
Jean-Luc's jacket?

585
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:27,957
Yes. He gave it to me.
He said I didn't have enough clothes.

586
00:34:27,959 --> 00:34:29,057
And I actually
really like it.

Wow.
This is just... I, I...

588
00:34:31,226 --> 00:34:34,057
I really cannot look at you
in the jacket.

589

(SIGHS)
He gave me the jacket.

590
00:34:35,792 --> 00:34:36,959
It's not like I took it
from him.

591
00:34:38,492 --> 00:34:39,890
Maybe... (SIGHS)

592
00:34:39,892 --> 00:34:42,890
Maybe we should
just rethink all of this.

Rethink what,
us dating?

00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:47,290

everyone seems to be mad.

all about you,

- like a broken record.
- Mom.

- I'm not mad.

Really? 'Cause you
seem mad to me.

617
00:35:47,059 --> 00:35:49,190
Maybe it's because you're
embarrassed by your family,

and I don't get that.

I wasn't embarrassed
by them.

620
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:55,357
So, you're embarrassed
by me, then?

621
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:57,224
(SIGHS)
I'm embarrassed by the fact

622
00:35:57,226 --> 00:35:59,123
that you don't want anyone
to know that we're dating.

Adrienne.

1585
01:50:05,375 --> 01:50:07,008
JEREMY: You were right.

1586
01:50:08,809 --> 01:50:10,709
I've never seen stars
like this before.

1587
01:50:15,509 --> 01:50:16,676
I love you, Melissa.

1588
01:50:19,476 --> 01:50:20,676
And I'm gonna tell your story.

1589
01:50:39,409 --> 01:50:41,142
(INAUDIBLE)

1590
01:51:01,342 --> 01:51:02,674
ADRIENNE:
<i>I feel very protective</i>

1591
01:51:02,676 --> 01:51:03,774
<i>of Jeremy and Melissa's story,</i>

1592
01:51:03,776 --> 01:51:05,607
(VOICE BREAKING)
<i>I think, because of how much</i>

1593
01:51:05,609 --> 01:51:07,407
<i>the Lord did in my life.</i>

1594
01:51:07,409 --> 01:51:09,676
<i>That it was something
that I needed to hear.</i>

1595
01:51:12,309 --> 01:51:14,507
JEREMY: <i>God was telling me to
pick my guitar up, and I'm like,</i>

1596
01:51:14,509 --> 01:51:16,040
<i>"The last I wanna do
is pick my guitar up."</i>

1597
01:51:16,042 --> 01:51:20,173
<i>I remember feeling the presence
of God so thick in that room.</i>

1598
01:51:20,175 --> 01:51:22,507
<i>Like, just, like,
I needed that.</i>

1599
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:26,242
<i>Right what came out was just,</i>

1600
01:51:27,175 --> 01:51:28,340
<i>"Okay. I still believe."</i>

1601
01:51:28,342 --> 01:51:31,674
<i>Literally. Like,
"I still believe in You."</i>

1602
01:51:31,676 --> 01:51:34,440
<i>That's what I wanted to say.</i>

1603
01:51:34,442 --> 01:51:37,040
<i>This is something that God
gave me as a gift to heal me,</i>

1604
01:51:37,042 --> 01:51:39,509
<i>and I believe that God was gonna
use it to heal many people.</i>
