1
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,801
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,445
At this pace, we will never finish.

3
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,864
It's really hot.
We're going to get sunburned.

4
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,867
He's taking so long
with the girls, right?

5
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:34,951
Yeah.

6
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,713
Damn kid,
put the drone down.

7
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,883
Calm down, Piporro.
I was following orders.

8
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,094
Yeah? No kidding!

9
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,680
Because the only orders
we follow here

10
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,765
are the ones from Cara Sucia,
my boss.

11
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,078
Come.

12
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,523
Hello.

13
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,193
- Hello.
- It's good to see you.

14
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,278
Oh...

15
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,864
Hey.

16
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,699
I wanted to talk with you.

17
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,117
I'm looking for Cara Sucia,

18
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,161
I called him on his cellphone

19
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,704
but he didn't answer.

20
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,457
He left really early
and I haven't heard from him.

21
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,875
Damn Cara Sucia.

22
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,918
Leave that.

23
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,463
Come with me,
and change your clothes.

24
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,799
- What should I wear, sir?
- I don't know.

25
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,177
Something decent.
Something that makes you look...

26
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,054
handsome, with personality.

27
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,181
- Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,479
Come, come.
How many?

29
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,064
What are you selling?

30
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:32,069
I think that the important thing here
is what I'm offering to you.

31
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,738
As you know,
it's been very dangerous lately.

32
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,491
This place is full of immigrants.

33
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:39,859
There are a lot of criminals.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,411
A lot of crooks.

35
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:44,164
We are offering protection.

36
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,791
Damn.

37
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,252
I support the local police.

38
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,380
Listen to him.

39
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,760
The local police have no idea

40
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,845
about what's happening
in the area.

41
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,188
And if you don't cooperate,
one day you'll wake up

42
00:03:02,263 --> 00:03:04,351
to see your store burnt down.
What do you say?

43
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,187
I barely earn enough money
to pay my expenses.

44
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,731
What a shame.

45
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,072
You'll have to work more then.
You and everybody here.

46
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,406
Okay?

47
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,826
This is our territory now.

48
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,705
And those who don't cooperate,
get their stores burned down.

49
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,580
Is that clear?

50
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,791
Yeah?

51
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,501
Okay.

52
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,057
We came to see Mr. Revueltas.

53
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,226
The boss is waiting for you.
Go ahead.

54
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,187
- Open the door.
- You're going to see El Botas,

55
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:52,482
you'll explain
how these things work, the...

56
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,570
- Drones.
- Yeah, that.

57
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,505
So, this is it.

58
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,631
So?

59
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,177
- Are you leaving? I'm the boss.
- Yeah.

60
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:22,416
- The boss of everyone.
- Yeah, sure.

61
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,389
I want it to be very clear.

62
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,516
- Yeah, Boss.
- So, go ahead.

63
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,059
Let's go.

64
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,355
Let's go over there.

65
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:33,856
To the tent.

66
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,950
This time,
we'll give you a chance.

67
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,119
Next time, be ready.

68
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:51,249
I want my money.
All of it, okay?

69
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
Here.

70
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,842
Damn you.

71
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,639
Fuck.

72
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,015
Give him this.

73
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,885
Wow, it's so cool!

74
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,471
Mom, can you give us a ride?

75
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,682
Yes, but first...

76
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,892
open up your presents!

77
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,687
Presents! Presents!

78
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,397
One for you and one for you.

79
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,629
Choche!

80
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,509
- How are you, man?
- How are you?

81
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,263
Wow, you haven't come here
in years!

82
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,682
- What have you been doing?
- Well, you know...

83
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,517
Working. What else?

84
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,896
This is the Yankee.
And this man in front of you

85
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,398
is the best businessman
in all Sinaloa.

86
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,399
Thanks, man.

87
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,069
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

88
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,363
I've heard a lot about you.

89
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,534
- Good things, I hope.
- No.

90
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,286
Bad things.

91
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,665
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes, yes.

92
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,126
- Let me.
- Thanks, kid.

93
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,630
- Here.
- Cheers.

94
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,173
- It's a pleasure, sir.
- Thanks.

95
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,057
Yeah.

96
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,978
- Great.
- Yes.

97
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,905
Boss, I almost forgot.

98
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,610
Can you tell him I already have
the information he needed?

99
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,445
- The coordinates?
- Yeah, those.

100
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,782
- Okay. There's work to do.
- Yeah, Boss. Okay.

101
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,408
Bye, Boss.

102
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:32,994
What, fuckers?

103
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,163
Damn crooks.

104
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,286
Can I help you?

105
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,621
Hello.

106
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,290
Yeah, I want...

107
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,544
I want this tattoo
on my chest.

108
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,298
And do you want one number
next to the other?

109
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,592
No, I was thinking...

110
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,845
One number on top of the other.

111
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,140
- Like coordinates.
- Okay.

112
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,142
Where do you want it?

113
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,101
Here.

114
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:40,811
Okay?

115
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,191
Is this the actual size?

116
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,317
I don't know.

117
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,112
What do you suggest?

118
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,322
Well...

119
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:56,327
I can show you two different fonts
and you can decide

120
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,996
which you like best.

121
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,329
Okay?

122
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,582
Okay.

123
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,626
Hold on a few minutes.

124
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,002
Take a seat.

125
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,653
Sir.

126
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,196
Everything okay?

127
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,910
Is that its nest?

128
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,245
Whose?

129
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,622
The animal, the owl.
Didn't you see it?

130
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,136
They told me you like technology.

131
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,889
Yeah, I love it.

132
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,224
And drones.

133
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,685
Yeah, drones are my specialty.

134
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,604
If you want, I can be your supplier.

135
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,149
- Dad!
- Kid!

136
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,317
- How are you?
- Say hi, darling.

137
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,819
- You look so nice.
- Thanks.

138
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,030
Let me introduce you to a new friend.
The Yankee.

139
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,993
- Nice to meet you.
- You too. Malcolm Moriarty.

140
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,246
For an American
he speaks good Spanish.

141
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,498
My mom was from Caborca.

142
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,458
So, at home we had to speak Spanish or...

143
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,626
pay the consequences.

144
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,712
- It should always be like that.
- Sure.

145
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:13,464
- In every home.
- So true.

146
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,387
Look.

147
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,141
What's that?

148
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,435
Open it.

149
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,695
It's your cut
from Longoria Real Estate.

150
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,573
Malcolm and I are
the only owners now.

151
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,337
Phoebe, I know this isn't my business,

152
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,256
and I don't want to know where
this money comes from,

153
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:00,678
but you can't just be giving cash away.

154
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,568
If it hurts, tell me and I'll stop.

155
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,572
No, don't worry.
I'm used to it.

156
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,699
Okay.

157
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,249
What are these coordinates for?

158
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,876
Or, where do they take you?

159
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,214
These are the coordinates
of the desert.

160
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,509
I had an experience there.

161
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,595
I wanted to mark the place.

162
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,347
I understand.

163
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,141
What's your name?

164
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,727
Laura.

165
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,857
What a nice name.

166
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
And yours?

167
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,905
I'm Fidelia.

168
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,351
Gentleman...

169
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:34,856
proceed.

170
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,525
Turn around!

171
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,654
We're in the middle of an operation
implemented by District Attorney Del Toro,

172
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:43,114
in this all-out war on crime.

173
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,546
District Attorney Del Toro,

174
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,952
why did you make the decision
to carry out this operation?

175
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:49,871
Look, lady...

176
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,873
SECURITY REINFORCED WITH HELP OF THE ARMY

177
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,374
The figures you see here,

178
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,794
kidnappers use them
to scare the citizens

179
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,590
and to destabilize peace
in the region.

180
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,259
But why is the army here?

181
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,428
The police wouldn't dare to do it?

182
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:06,637
That's nonsense.

183
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,768
We're working together with the army
on this occasion,

184
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,312
as it concerns
our homeland security.

185
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,274
Okay, sir, and how do you think
this operation will have an impact

186
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,319
on the reduction of the rate of violence?

187
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,070
Excuse me.

188
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,157
Attorney Del Toro?
Follow me!

189
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,326
Okay, cut.

190
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,965
Move.

191
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,599
They are dead.

192
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,685
Cabe and Pacheco.

193
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,645
No way.

194
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,565
And Plácido?

195
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,695
He was with them.

196
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,705
They wanted to find us
to cut our tongues out.

197
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,083
- Shut up.
- No, no, don't kill her.

198
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,529
- No, I'm done.
- You're so weak.

199
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,697
Cheers, cheers.

200
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,531
All of it.

201
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,785
What's going on, guys?
Aren't you...?

202
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,036
Are you just chatting?

203
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,205
- Yes, Uncle.
- Yes.

204
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,499
Kid, I have to take him.

205
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,126
- What for?
- But, we are...

206
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,253
Yeah, fine. See you later.

207
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:03,545
See you.

208
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,339
I already told you...

209
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:08,968
Carlos Revueltas
is an important businessman,

210
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,344
but aside from that,

211
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,597
he's friends with Botas' cartel.

212
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,184
So, don't mess with her,

213
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,270
or you will see his true colors.

214
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,022
You'll have a lot of problems.

215
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,609
Yes, Mr. Cecho, don't worry.
Let me answer this call.

216
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,914
Wilson, what do you want?
I'm busy.

217
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,207
<i>We have a problem.</i>

218
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,669
Pacheco and Cabe were killed.

219
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,928
Hey, and...

220
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,056
What did you do
with the bodies?

221
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,599
<i>We have them in the trunk.</i>

222
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,143
We found them in the road

223
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,562
in really bad shape and...

224
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,857
we are looking for Plácido.
We don't know where he is.

225
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,525
This...

226
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,862
is not over, Wilson.
Relax.

227
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,113
I'm coming.

228
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,742
I need you to wait for me, okay?

229
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:16,326
<i>Okay.</i>

230
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,715
Hey, Yankee.
Where are you going?

231
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,010
- Hey, wait.
- Choche, I was betrayed.

232
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,387
They set me up.

233
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,017
If you want to be in this business,
get used to betrayals.

234
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,525
You will never have a calm day.

235
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,022
So, trust your people.
I know what I'm talking about.

236
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:45,982
I don't care.

237
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,860
No, let's go. This is an important day.

238
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,155
You have to meet these people
so they trust you.

239
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,951
Then, we'll figure out
the rest.

240
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,958
- What's up?
- What's up, girl?

241
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,793
- What's up?
- It's all good.

242
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,962
- Are you selling ice cream?
- No.

243
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,091
Are you waiting
for somebody?

244
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,758
Hello.

245
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,095
What's going on?

246
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,931
You look so nice.

247
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,767
Thanks.

248
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,984
- Give me another one.
- Yes.

249
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,110
She's paying...

250
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,195
- She's paying?
- My friend will pay, yeah.

251
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,363
- Here.
- Hey.

252
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,283
- I just saw a guy with a tattoo.
- What?

253
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:38,951
What?

254
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,536
I just saw a guy with a tattoo.

255
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,996
What's up?

256
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,081
- What's up, Peggio?
- How are you?

257
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,667
Arleen is already near the wall
waiting for you.

258
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,337
- Well, I'm ready if she's ready.
- You bet.

259
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,589
- Hello.
- This is Laura.

260
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,049
- I'm Peggio.
- Hello.

261
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,132
He's the owner.

262
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,510
Think of this as your house.
Do as you please.

263
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,844
Cool.

264
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,139
Hey, Fidelia.

265
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,643
- There's a guy with a tattoo.
- What?

266
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,647
You know what? Nothing.

267
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,318
I needed to go out.
I haven't been out in ages.

268
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,196
Well, girl,

269
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,657
if you want to have
a better time...

270
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,331
No one's forcing you.

271
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,209
Or what?

272
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,244
So, you are the <i>gringo</i>, right?

273
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:07,498
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, I said "<i>gringo"</i>.

274
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,794
Yankee. I'm sorry.
I'm Parra.

275
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,213
Nice to meet you, sir.

276
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:16,757
Botas!

277
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,509
Come, Botas.

278
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,679
He's the kid with the drones.

279
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:22,847
- Sir.
- Kid?

280
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,392
At his age, I was already dominating
half of Sinaloa.

281
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,728
So?

282
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,939
How much coke
can those things carry?

283
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:33,815
Well,

284
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,402
about three kilos.

285
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,027
And those things,

286
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,947
how many trips can they make?

287
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,200
As many as you please.

288
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,245
If you have the people and equipment,
as many as you like.

289
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,748
Okay then. I like that!

290
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:49,707
Yeah, sure.

291
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,208
Hey, waiter!

292
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,880
Chocolate martini.

293
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,342
- I like these.
- Yeah.

294
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,345
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

295
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,055
Cheers, sir.

296
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,171
Do whatever you want, darling.

297
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,965
Do me whatever you want.

298
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,226
Where were you, bitch?

299
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,105
What's going on, Plácido?

300
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,691
Why were you hiding?

301
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,902
I'm sorry, man.

302
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:44,863
I'm sorry, but...

303
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:48,576
I can't be seen with you.
I don't want any trouble.

304
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,286
What happened?

305
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:52,997
What do you mean?

306
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,249
We were attacked, man.

307
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,001
You were attacked?

308
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,797
And why are you alive
while Cabe and Pacheco are dead?

309
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:03,883
Huh?

310
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,969
Hold on, man.
Give me a chance.

311
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,179
Fuck you.

312
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:15,936
What happened?

313
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,440
Man, I...

314
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,445
I went to buy some beers.

315
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,822
And when I came back...

316
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,243
Piporro and his friends
were killing them.

317
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:35,164
<i>I wanted to do something.</i>

318
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,835
I wanted to help them,
but I couldn't.

319
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,921
- Piporro?
- Yeah, him.

320
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,507
- No way!
- Are you sure it was Piporro?

321
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:49,678
It was him.

322
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,690
I have a surprise for you.

323
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,484
Huh?

324
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,868
Damn Choche.
You already finished, bastard.

325
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,412
Yeah, I needed a four.

326
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,331
No, a five.
Can't you add?

327
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,834
- No, I wasn't aware of that.
- You're a bastard. You can't play.

328
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:22,795
- Stand up.
- Don't yell at me.

329
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,254
- Come on, move.
- I'm moving.

330
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,007
Hey, man, come.

331
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,217
You'll play with me.

332
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,051
You start.

333
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,179
Come here.
Where are you going?

334
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,263
Sir...

335
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,892
I have to go to Santa Ana.
I have an emergency.

336
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,602
No, no emergency.

337
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,772
- You have to stay here.
- No, it's important.

338
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,775
No, the important thing
is for you to stay here with them

339
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,318
right now. Come.

340
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,195
Eleven, bastard?

341
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:52,157
You can't play.
You're worse than him. Go, move!

342
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,243
Move!
Hey, can you play?

343
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,537
You, can you play?

344
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,914
- Yes.
- Have a seat. Let's play.

345
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,632
What does it say?

346
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,676
Fuck.

347
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,470
It's clear in the video.
We don't have to understand it.

348
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,557
Really? What do you mean?

349
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,059
It's not like we are selling pineapples.

350
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,938
- What does it say, Plácido?
- I don't know, man.

351
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:24,606
Watch the image.

352
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:28,819
So, move it forward.

353
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,410
Now what?

354
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,086
I think your luck is about
to run out.

355
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,342
- Go, Yankee, do it.
- Here we go!

356
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:54,887
Yeah! Come on!

357
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,179
That's my guy!

358
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,017
Botas, don't talk about luck,

359
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,019
my financial trader
has disappeared.

360
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,397
- Did the feds do it?
- No, I don't think so.

361
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,443
Neither the public ministry
nor the judge have him.

362
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,362
And the worst thing is that he
has problems with the Americans.

363
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:13,446
Besides...

364
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,908
Fuck that phone.

365
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,367
Sorry.

366
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,288
Remember, every time Americans
come to Mexico,

367
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,998
they want to do things their way.

368
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,124
Yeah.

369
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,919
Okay, well played, Yankee.

370
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:28,628
Thanks, sir.

371
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,340
I'll leave now.

372
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,635
- You win, and then you leave?
- I'm going to go see my wife.

373
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,471
We have been partying
for two days.

374
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,140
And if I don't show up,
she'll freak out.

375
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,934
- We'll be in touch.
- Don't leave.

376
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,685
- Bye, Parra.
- Yes.

377
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,772
Don't leave, Botas.

378
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,984
I'll introduce you to some girls I met.
I'll talk with your wife.

379
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,737
No. Let me walk you out.

380
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,410
Seatbelts.

381
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,667
Go ahead, guys.

382
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,171
You already went through a lot
to be here, right?

383
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,840
In a few days you'll be
on the other side.

384
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,219
- God willing.
- Wait, wait.

385
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Wait.

386
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,934
- Damn, man...
- Shut up.

387
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,686
Now, go. Leave.

388
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,105
There he is.

389
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,191
Okay. I'm getting close.

390
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,652
Yes.

391
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,448
I'm getting close.

392
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,701
There, there.

393
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,171
He saw us.

394
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:20,384
- Get closer.
- I'm doing it.

395
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,467
Get closer!

396
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,011
There.

397
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,181
- Okay, okay.
- Fine!

398
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,474
No!

399
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:29,976
Where is he?

400
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,281
He's still alive.

401
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,617
No way!
Let's go, man.

402
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,829
What did you do?
This is so wrong.

403
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,374
No way.

404
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,004
- You are so dumb.
- What did you do?

405
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,589
- See?
- He's still alive.

406
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,675
- I told you to get close.
- He has a gun!

407
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,552
- Take it.
- How?

408
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,472
How? How can we kill him?

409
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Move.

410
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,560
Go ahead, man.

411
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,440
Fuck!

412
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:19,026
Fuck, no way.
Kill him!

413
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,988
Fucker!

414
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,295
If I give you an order
and you don't obey,

415
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,840
I'll send you where we sent
those bastards!

416
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,259
Sir, they are all over the place.

417
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,261
The Contras control them.

418
00:30:46,717 --> 00:30:49,723
They are extorting storekeepers
in the northern part of the state.

419
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,683
Hermosillo, Santa Ana, Nogales.

420
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
Who saw you?

421
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,242
Nobody, Boss.

422
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,539
We have to get rid of the body.

423
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,418
We have to recover the coke
they stole from us.

424
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:21,713
Morre, tell the bosses of...

425
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,509
Cabe and Pacheco that...

426
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,011
I'll take care of the funeral.

427
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,304
Yes, sir.

428
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,349
Close that. Let's go.

429
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,384
Come on, man.

430
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:09,845
Let's go.

431
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,775
Let's go.

432
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,375
How are you, Mom?

433
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,922
But is everything okay?

434
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:54,264
Mom, I wanted to ask you
if something weird

435
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,724
happened over there.

436
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,811
Okay then.

437
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,409
- What's up?
- What's going on?

438
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,287
Don't go over there.

439
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,123
Cara Sucia is drunk
and he tends to get violent.

440
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:21,625
I better leave.

441
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,335
- Thanks.
- Bye.

442
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,418
Let's go.

443
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,256
- Let's go.
- Gringo, don't move.

444
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,343
Where did you take Piporro?

445
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,183
Are you kidding?
I'm not in the mood.

446
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,561
Don't act so stuck-up,
you are just an ambitious bitch

447
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,232
who thinks that he'll get away with this.
But you are just a bastard.

448
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,028
Fucker, you only think you are the boss,
calm the fuck down.

449
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,111
What did you say?

450
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,539
What the hell is going on?

451
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,581
Drop your weapons.

452
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,004
Drop your weapons!
Don't you understand?

453
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,259
Didn't you hear me?

454
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,261
Drop your weapon!

455
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,722
Now, let's grab some food.

456
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,934
Let's have a drink.
Okay, go to work!

457
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,478
Go to work, now!

458
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,278
Let's go!

459
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,572
Alright!

460
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,997
Calm the fuck down, bastards!

461
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,083
I can't believe this.

462
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,336
Enough!
