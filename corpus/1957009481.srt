1
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,849
A wise horse once told me...

2
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:04,022
...that a mustang's spirit
can never be broken.

3
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,943
That it has the strength of the ocean...

4
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,490
and lives forever, like the wind.

5
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,286
Over the course of my life...

6
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,374
my spirit has been tested
a thousand times...

7
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,545
until I discovered a secret that saved me.

8
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:34,344
And to tell you what it is,
we have to start at the very beginning.

9
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,056
The story of a wild horse...

10
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,976
and the girl she loved.

11
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,238
I was born in a golden meadow...

12
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,033
on a bed of soft wildflowers.

13
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,015
My mother showed me our home.

14
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:24,019
It was endless...

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,022
and beautiful.

16
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,488
I was a little shy to meet my family.

17
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,992
There were so many of them.

18
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,375
To prove myself to the herd...

19
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,048
I had to be strong and fast and fearless.

20
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,557
As I got older,
I felt a fire rising up in me.

21
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,313
My mother said it was my mustang spirit,
and it would always guide me.

22
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,568
She said I should never kick or bite
without a good reason,

23
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,364
but always try to be gentle and kind.

24
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:28,041
My heart ached to explore
the world beyond our meadow.

25
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,629
A place nobody could ever take from us.

26
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:43,807
When I turned two years old,
I made a discovery.

27
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:50,480
Strange creatures
were moving onto our land.

28
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:59,239
It was against the rules
to leave the mountains...

29
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,618
but I had to find out
where they were coming from.

30
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,125
We gotta find that mustang herd.

31
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,462
There she goes.
We're coming back for you, pretty thing!

32
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,640
I knew I had put
my whole family in danger.

33
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,771
That night my mother told me a story

34
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,357
about what happens
when a horse leaves this Earth.

35
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,986
That she wouldn't always be there
to protect me...

36
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,031
but that I shouldn't worry

37
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,533
because when it is a horse's time to go...

38
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,786
it gallops toward the sky,

39
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,414
just as if it can fly.

40
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,751
And that when her time came...

41
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,962
she would always watch over me...

42
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,799
from her bed in the stars.

43
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,479
Whoo-hoo! Ha-ha!

44
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,440
I knew I had made a terrible mistake.

45
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,568
I had led them right to us.

46
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,193
- Yeehaw!
- Yah, yah!

47
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,199
That filly's out of her mind.

48
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,537
It was my first experience
with the creatures they called...

49
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,414
humans.

50
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,300
I lost my mother in the stampede.

51
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,512
It was the last time I ever saw her.

52
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,268
And I knew it was all my fault.

53
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:41,443
I felt hurt and guilty and just so angry.

54
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,364
My mother said a mustang's spirit
could never be broken.

55
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,201
But I was beginning to doubt
if that was true.

56
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,163
My spirit felt shattered.

57
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,256
Hey. How you doin'?

58
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,799
Well, well, well.

59
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,011
From all the way out east?

60
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,972
Quite the haul.

61
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,100
I drove all the way out from New York.

62
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,064
You gotta get fresh water.

63
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,983
Yeah, I was just about to change it out
this morning.

64
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,651
One of my staffers got sick.

65
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,820
How many you looking to take?

66
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,864
Just a few.

67
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,785
Wow!

68
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,203
She's a pretty one.

69
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,456
Yeah, well,
that filly's got a horrible temper.

70
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,209
Trust me, you don't want her.

71
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,503
She's a strike horse anyway.

72
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,254
It's leaving this afternoon.

73
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,718
He's adopting 20 of them.

74
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,223
We don't exactly keep a record
of where our strike horses go.

75
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:56,768
Course you don't.

76
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,646
The new man seemed different.

77
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,065
His eyes were softer.

78
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,817
Poor girl.

79
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,487
You're just frightened. I know.

80
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,698
And angry, I'm sure.

81
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,827
A lot of personality, all right.

82
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,247
Well-built too. Elegant.

83
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,084
Okay, boys, that's it.
Round 'em up.

84
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,045
Hold on. I'll take her.

85
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:33,263
As we drove away from that awful place,

86
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,350
I had no idea how lucky I was
to be one of the few chosen.

87
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,812
Because not many people
want a wild mustang to train.

88
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,152
We went down the long gray path for days.

89
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,438
There you go. Buck it out.

90
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,982
Well, she's a gorgeous one, John.

91
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,985
-She is, isn't she?
-It's just...

92
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,447
The other ones seem much more decidedly...

93
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,115
Tame?

94
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,451
I was going to say sane, but yes.

95
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,256
Hey! God!!

96
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,892
She'll settle in.

97
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,269
- Trust me.
- I do.

98
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,480
But the rescues
have a time limit here, John.

99
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,773
We both know that.

100
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,445
My first night at Birtwick.

101
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,532
I miss my family.

102
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,077
The other horses were all strangers.

103
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,748
But it was quieter there.

104
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,584
And I could hear a new sound.

105
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,379
Smell salt on the air.

106
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,800
It was peaceful.

107
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,388
And finally, I slept.

108
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,777
I wondered what the new man
wanted from me.

109
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,167
He couldn't possibly understand.

110
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,753
All right. In your own time.

111
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,216
The boy and I developed a game.

112
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,887
-We played it together...
-Easy.

113
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,389
...each and every day.

114
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,100
I always won.

115
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,271
My mother would not have approved,

116
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:31,399
but humans had not been kind
or good to me.

117
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,902
So why should I be to them?

118
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,113
That mustang's
got a real mean streak.

119
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,948
Right now, she's just angry.

120
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:44,037
Wouldn't you be if a UFO came down
and stole you from your family?

121
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,790
Yeah, I guess so.

122
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,043
Still, I don't see how
you can break a horse like that.

123
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,921
For her sake, let's try, shall we?

124
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,347
There you go.

125
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,183
I decided humans must be very lazy.

126
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,104
They always wanted
to be carried around by something.

127
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,408
Bet you haven't seen one of these
in the wild.

128
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,666
The man thought
he could outsmart me with his tricks.

129
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,834
Good girl.

130
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,169
But he had underestimated me.

131
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,505
Okay.

132
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,848
One day I got a neighbor.

133
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,060
I liked the fire in her immediately.

134
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,648
She was followed by the funniest
little horse I had ever seen.

135
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,776
It looked like he couldn't stop dancing.

136
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:02,407
I learned that they were called
Ginger and Merrylegs.

137
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:07,078
We eventually became friends,
and they turned us out together.

138
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,541
I was so happy to have a family again.

139
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,468
The man who brought me there
made his home near my paddock.

140
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,805
Hello. John Manly.

141
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,641
I noticed he was always alone.

142
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:32,604
What?

143
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:13,770
Jo.

144
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:17,649
I'm so ver...

145
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,860
I'm so sorry for your loss.

146
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,698
Call if you need anything.

147
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,745
I would eventually hear
from different people at Birtwick...

148
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:35,458
the girl's parents had died
in a car accident.

149
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,378
John was her uncle.

150
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,224
There was
something different about the girl.

151
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,478
Something I recognized.

152
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,278
Her spirit seemed broken.

153
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,577
Jo.

154
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,037
I'm sorry.

155
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,248
I have dinner on the table.

156
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,666
I'm not hungry.

157
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,002
You have to eat something.

158
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,670
I don't.

159
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,005
Just...

160
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,966
please leave me alone.

161
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,557
It was a few days before I saw her again.

162
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,520
So, I continued my game with the boy.

163
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,279
John decided to play too.

164
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,491
But even with a horse to help him...

165
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,035
he couldn't keep up with me.

166
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:13,890
Pretty, isn't she?

167
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,603
I didn't mean to scare you.

168
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,399
What's her name?

169
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,151
I haven't given her a name yet.

170
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,279
You know, if you like...

171
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:38,039
You know, that horse out there,
she was rounded up out west.

172
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:44,379
Taken away from her herd,
her family, all she'd ever known.

173
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,258
Her whole world's been turned upside down.

174
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,342
Please stop.

175
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:51,845
Stop what?

176
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,555
I don't need your sympathy.

177
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,599
I don't want any part of your world.

178
00:16:56,683 --> 00:17:00,729
I'm here because the state says that
I have to be, instead of in my own home.

179
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:04,315
Jo. You don't have anywhere else.

180
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,068
You think I don't know that?

181
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:11,281
Are you seriously saying that
to me right now?

182
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:16,870
Look. I don't know you.

183
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:18,872
You don't know me.

184
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,958
We'll get used to each other in time.

185
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,712
You're not my family.

186
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,928
Just stay away from me.

187
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,730
Well, good.

188
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,733
Now I have two girls
who want nothing to do with me.

189
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,030
You see how his head is turned away
from me?

190
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,490
He doesn't want to look at me.

191
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,450
Wants nothing to do with me.

192
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,702
That's what I wanna change.

193
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,789
Start gaining his trust.

194
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,376
Apply a little pressure.

195
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,296
Then I give him his space.

196
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,258
I'm trying to talk to him,
to learn his language.

197
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,012
It isn't about controlling him
or forcing him

198
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,181
or making him do something
he doesn't wanna do.

199
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,686
We have to find a balance together,
a give and take.

200
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:28,066
Now, he might not be able to talk, but
he's saying a whole lot to me right now.

201
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:34,572
The biggest rule is,
I can't get angry or frustrated at him.

202
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:41,079
If I get angry, he'll feel it.
He'll get angry too.

203
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,679
Horses are a window to your soul.

204
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,558
They can read your facial expressions,
your emotions.

205
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,978
They'll feel everything you do.

206
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:10,483
My goal through this work
is to help each horse find his peace.

207
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,798
Is there a horse
he hasn't been able to break?

208
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:34,799
Nope.

209
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,761
Not yet, anyway.

210
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:42,932
She'll come around.

211
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:44,851
Yeah.

212
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,270
How's she doin'?

213
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:50,857
Stays locked in her room
unless she's at school.

214
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,026
- Hey, Jo.
- Barely speaks to me.

215
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,237
Well, like it or not, I'm better
with horses than I am with people.

216
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,323
She'll come around.

217
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,134
So you know you're beautiful.

218
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,558
I know you are though.

219
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,061
Yeah, Fitzpatrick's been doing
really wonderfully, so...

220
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,229
That's good.

221
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,313
That new girl?

222
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,316
You know she actually lives here?

223
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,028
That's weird.

224
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,489
No wonder she smells.

225
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,367
She can still hear us.

226
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,739
I heard you lost your family too.

227
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,325
I'm sorry.

228
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,959
I don't know why
anyone would try to tame you.

229
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,379
You don't belong here.

230
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:40,967
And neither do I.

231
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,999
Gotta ease 'em into it.
Get 'em used to the weight.

232
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,419
Make 'em realize it's not gonna hurt.

233
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,715
You gotta always say, "Thank you."

234
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,427
You show him respect
when he's trusted you,

235
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,680
done a good thing for you.

236
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:30,141
Attaboy.

237
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,269
Thank you.

238
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,650
Sunday means scrambled eggs.

239
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,612
Got a new recipe here with grits.

240
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:44,197
Um...

241
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,074
No thanks.

242
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,452
I saw you listening
to my lesson yesterday.

243
00:22:56,584 --> 00:23:00,088
I... I thought you might like this.

244
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:04,843
My mentor gave it to me.

245
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:09,973
What's it about?

246
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,642
How to talk to horses.

247
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:21,526
"There is no secret so close
as that between a rider and his horse."

248
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:24,696
R. S. Surtees.

249
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:30,035
- You read poetry?
- I do.

250
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:33,997
Seamus Heaney, E. E. Cummings,

251
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,499
they're all in the shelf in there.

252
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,210
Welcome to take a book whenever you like.

253
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:48,970
Thank you.

254
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,677
You really are beautiful.

255
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:40,313
-John, Jo is out there.
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

256
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,981
You'll frighten the horse.

257
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,942
She could run her right over.

258
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,461
Maybe that's what I'll call you.

259
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,174
Beauty.

260
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:12,345
Would you like that?

261
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:17,392
Beauty.

262
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,312
Black Beauty.

263
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,359
I liked the name.

264
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:32,741
After that day,
I realized that, just maybe,

265
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:36,369
there was one person
who could actually understand me.

266
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:38,538
John...

267
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,125
she's not afraid to be in there?

268
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,209
Nope.

269
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,045
Does Jo ride?

270
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,964
Never been around a horse in her life.

271
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,468
And the amazing thing was...

272
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:52,552
Thank you.

273
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:55,805
...I understood her too.

274
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:03,855
Are you ready for dinner?

275
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,649
I got a couple of nice steaks on sale.

276
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,361
You really like food.

277
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:12,072
I like to cook. Can't you tell?

278
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:16,284
You've gotten closer to that filly in days
than I have in weeks.

279
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,745
We get each other, I guess.

280
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,415
Jo...

281
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,209
Stop.

282
00:26:24,876 --> 00:26:27,754
-Jo, I just think...
-I don't wanna talk about it.

283
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,674
-You have to... eventually.
-Why?

284
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:33,343
Well, at some point you have
to tell me what you're feeling.

285
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,928
I wanna tell you how I'm feeling.

286
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,013
Why would I care
about what you're feeling?

287
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:41,184
You didn't bother to see my mom.
You didn't even bother to meet me.

288
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:44,020
- No, no. No, I met you. I met you.
- Yeah?

289
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:46,189
- I saw you. When you were...
- Yeah?

290
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:49,567
And I barely remembered your face
when I got here.

291
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,153
Jo. Jo, I'm sorry.

292
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:53,655
Don't touch me.

293
00:26:58,368 --> 00:26:59,953
I wanna go home.

294
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,789
You can't go home, Jo. You can't go home.

295
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:03,957
Your mom and dad...

296
00:27:09,212 --> 00:27:10,213
I'm sorry.

297
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:13,717
Jo.

298
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,054
- Jo?
- I said, leave me alone!

299
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:18,972
You stop...

300
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,557
They were like two mustangs,

301
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,183
fighting in the wild.

302
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:24,686
And as I watched them,

303
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:30,275
I realized maybe humans and horses
weren't so different after all.

304
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,239
I couldn't sleep at all that night.

305
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:39,784
I was too worried about Jo.

306
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:58,386
The look on her face made my heart break.

307
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:07,687
I recognized it because I still had
nightmares about losing my family.

308
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,034
In that moment...

309
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:26,456
I wished I could tell Jo
where her parents were,

310
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,209
like my mother had told me.

311
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:33,963
Watching over her...

312
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,385
from their bed in the stars.

313
00:28:43,306 --> 00:28:46,851
I stayed with her
until the sun rose again the next day.

314
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,314
Jo?

315
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:52,565
Where are you?

316
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:58,822
Jo?

317
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:01,991
Jo.

318
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:03,993
Thank God.

319
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,745
You scared the life out of me.

320
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:08,873
What are you doing sleeping out here?

321
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:15,463
What am I supposed to do with you?

322
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,092
This is new terrain for me too, you know.

323
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:21,803
You're grounded.

324
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,264
Really?

325
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:25,849
Yeah, really.

326
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,268
In fact, I have a better idea.

327
00:29:29,352 --> 00:29:31,938
I'm gonna show you
how to wield a pitchfork.

328
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:38,653
- Well, yeah, but it's not...
- But I'm not going to...

329
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:40,447
You don't have to be intimidated,
you know.

330
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,781
I'm not...

331
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:44,576
She's cleaning up after our horses.

332
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:46,619
That is so sad.

333
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,204
Super sad.

334
00:29:51,082 --> 00:29:54,669
I heard if they can't save them,
they turn them into glue.

335
00:29:57,088 --> 00:29:59,466
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

336
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:00,675
Um...

337
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,886
You've just got a little something there.

338
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:06,514
Yeah.
You got a little something right there.

339
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,313
- I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?

340
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:15,106
- Come over here and help me.
- Just...

341
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,191
My God!

342
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:17,859
-You're fine. It's just...
-No, I'm not fine.

343
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:20,195
-You've just got a little bit of dirt...
-Obviously, I'm not fine!

344
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:22,572
It's disgusting, and it's
ridiculous, and it's unacceptable.

345
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,284
This place sucks.

346
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:31,581
Sorry. Not here with you.

347
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,877
This is the only safe place there is.

348
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:42,634
School sucks. People suck.

349
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:46,638
Maybe we should just run away together.

350
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:50,433
What you think?

351
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,529
No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's gone.

352
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:05,323
She's conditioned to hate it.

353
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,701
She's a smart horse.

354
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:15,792
Did you know that wild mustang bands
aren't led by a stallion?

355
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:18,712
They're usually led by a mare.

356
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:22,424
Not always the biggest or strongest
or most popular,

357
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:25,343
but the one who's gone through
the most life experience.

358
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:27,929
She leads through respect.

359
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,017
That's why mustangs are unique.

360
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,936
Why are you telling me this?

361
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:36,896
'Cause, to me,

362
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,400
I think you're more of a wise mustang
than a yappy little show dog.

363
00:31:43,653 --> 00:31:45,071
Dinner's ready in ten.

364
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:47,657
I'm making lasagna.

365
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:55,498
You can't even lead the horse, John.
She's a lost cause.

366
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:58,168
I just need a bit more time.

367
00:31:58,251 --> 00:32:01,254
Now, you know we just can't keep
the mustangs that won't be gentle.

368
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,715
We have to make space.

369
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:16,936
So, Mr. Gordon says
that if you don't get tamed,

370
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,314
you're gonna have to go somewhere else.

371
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:21,566
And probably not as nice of a place.

372
00:32:28,323 --> 00:32:32,077
Now... I know you're not gonna hurt me...

373
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:37,165
and I'm not gonna hurt you... ever.

374
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,251
So do you think we could try?

375
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,463
And show him how gentle you are?

376
00:32:49,552 --> 00:32:50,929
I know. I know.

377
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:54,599
It can't be all that bad, right?

378
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,060
It's better than being homeless.

379
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,145
Please.

380
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:01,940
Just trust me.

381
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:04,609
Here, look.

382
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:08,697
Wow.

383
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,656
See?

384
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,117
See, it doesn't hurt me.

385
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:18,748
Okay.

386
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,334
Let's try this.

387
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:30,176
See?

388
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,388
There.

389
00:33:36,516 --> 00:33:38,101
Almost there.

390
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:44,190
It's all right.

391
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:51,656
Well, there's no way
she's actually going to lead her.

392
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,327
Would you walk with me? Come on.

393
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:01,332
Beginner's luck.

394
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:04,919
Yeah. Or maybe she's just talented.

395
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,843
Well, I'll be darned.

396
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,598
Maybe you two have something
in common after all.

397
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,192
Don't want any part of this world?

398
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:29,235
This is different.

399
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:39,788
The sparring between Jo and
her uncle happened much less after that.

400
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,669
So you do like it?

401
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:47,629
Well, good.

402
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:51,508
Uncle John says you're safe for now,
but you'll be broken in soon,

403
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:53,009
whatever that means.

404
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:57,472
Jo was proud of me,
and I wanted to prove myself to her.

405
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,643
So the first thing is the bridle.
Let's see how this goes.

406
00:35:01,726 --> 00:35:03,395
Come on, Beauty.

407
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:06,481
Beauty, come on.

408
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:08,233
I have an idea.

409
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:11,820
Maybe the taste won't be so bad.

410
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,575
-There you...
-There you go.

411
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,703
How'd you know how to do that?

412
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:21,788
Felt like the right thing to do, I guess.

413
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:30,463
I knew humans liked
to wear things on their feet. But horses?

414
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:31,798
Beauty.

415
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:38,054
Ginger and Merrylegs laughed loud enough
for the whole stable to hear.

416
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:40,849
It was so embarrassing.

417
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,226
Saddle is next.

418
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:48,189
You take the pad first and get her
used to something weighing on her.

419
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:50,233
- Ready?
- Nice. Yeah. Nice and slowly.

420
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:52,986
Easy now. Come on, Beauty.

421
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:57,907
Come on.

422
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,501
There we go.

423
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:10,920
Now we're making some progress.

424
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,592
Do we really have to put that on her?

425
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:17,719
To break her, yeah.

426
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:19,471
Why do you call it that?

427
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,431
What?

428
00:36:21,514 --> 00:36:22,891
"Breaking."

429
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:25,602
It's just a term. Breaking a horse.

430
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:26,936
Should really change it.

431
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,773
What would you change it to?

432
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:33,568
"Partnering."

433
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:36,821
Partner a horse.

434
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:41,451
All right. Ready?

435
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,455
Attagirl.

436
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:48,083
You did it.

437
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:51,378
Hi, Jo.

438
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:54,839
You're all right.

439
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,508
Doesn't it feel too soon?

440
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,803
I mean, she's come so far already.

441
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:02,055
Not far enough.

442
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:04,307
We can't sell her if she can't be ridden.

443
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:06,434
Sell her?

444
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:08,395
What do you think we're breaking her for?

445
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:12,232
Sorry, "partnering." I do like that.

446
00:37:12,315 --> 00:37:13,983
But why would you sell her?

447
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,237
Jo. I don't own this place.

448
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:21,491
The conservancy part is to train
and adopt out a few mustangs a year,

449
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:23,076
not to keep them.

450
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,996
Do you know how many are out there
that need help? Thousands.

451
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:31,584
Let's give it a go. Nice and easy.

452
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:38,299
-It's okay, girl. It's okay.
-All right, Beauty. Attagirl.

453
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:45,932
Uncle John!

454
00:37:47,142 --> 00:37:48,393
Uncle John!

455
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:55,442
Are you okay?

456
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:58,319
I'll survive.

457
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:03,616
Ooh!

458
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:10,957
My friendship with Jo
blossomed, like flowers do in spring.

459
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:15,503
Some of these really are beautiful.

460
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:20,175
We had an unspoken language... together.

461
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:45,742
Do you ever think
about your family, Beauty?

462
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:50,413
I try not to think of mine.

463
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:54,167
It hurts too much.

464
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:56,294
You know?

465
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:02,842
I hated seeing her so upset.

466
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:07,764
When I was sad, I ran as fast as I could.

467
00:39:08,973 --> 00:39:12,644
But since Jo couldn't gallop,
I had an idea.

468
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:17,565
What are you doing?

469
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:21,569
Do you want me to...

470
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:29,619
I can't. I don't know how.

471
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,496
I really wished she would try.

472
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:34,249
I knew Jo could be fearless.

473
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:35,709
Okay.

474
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:48,304
Whoa!

475
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,942
Whoa!.

476
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:03,194
I had trusted her.

477
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:07,157
Now she needed to trust me.

478
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,074
John!

479
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:10,035
Mr. Gordon!

480
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,663
- Beauty!
- What the...

481
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:26,676
I knew that if Jo
could feel the wind in her mane,

482
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:28,845
it would help her to heal.

483
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:48,365
- Jo, hold on!
- Jo!

484
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:51,284
Whoa!

485
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:52,577
-Jo!
-Jo!

486
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,788
No! Jo.

487
00:40:56,122 --> 00:40:57,957
Jo? Are you all right? Are you hurt?

488
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,796
That was amazing.

489
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:12,347
Jo and I learned to ride together.

490
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,225
- Is that good?
- It's good.

491
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:17,686
That's it. Keep control.

492
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:20,814
She fell a lot in the beginning.

493
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:22,899
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

494
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:25,860
No wonder they rode horses.

495
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,029
Humans were very clumsy.

496
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:29,948
Maybe we should try Merrylegs instead.

497
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:33,868
-Back on?
-Back on.

498
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:40,291
But we got the hang of it, together.

499
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,712
Partners.

500
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,592
Come on, Beauty. Let's go faster.

501
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:08,528
Jo and I galloped
like nothing in the world could catch us.

502
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:12,407
We were two beings,

503
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:16,202
and yet, for just a moment...

504
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:18,872
we were one.

505
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:39,434
We had found our peace... together.

506
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:53,073
As the summer ended,
there was new life all around.

507
00:42:54,783 --> 00:42:57,410
They reminded me of my mother and I.

508
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:04,584
When the big yellow trailer
came for Jo again...

509
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:07,504
I could smell change on the air.

510
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:12,926
Riding wasn't
as much fun without Jo,

511
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:15,595
but I had to learn
to have others on my back.

512
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:21,017
I started to like John,
even though he was kind of heavy.

513
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:31,319
A new groom started taking care of us.

514
00:43:31,403 --> 00:43:34,239
He was always very distracted.

515
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:38,118
If the sky fell down,
I wondered if he would even notice.

516
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:40,912
Hey, you can wait. Come on.

517
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:42,872
Birtwick will be underwater if we don't.

518
00:43:42,956 --> 00:43:46,292
I'm trying to keep the mustang program
alive, but business hasn't been...

519
00:43:46,376 --> 00:43:48,545
I understand. Hey.

520
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:51,423
You gotta get your nose out of that phone
while you're working.

521
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,553
Sorry, Mr. Manly. Sorry, Mr. Gordon.

522
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:59,848
Make sure to watch the new filly tonight.
She might get chilled.

523
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:01,141
Sure thing.

524
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:20,744
I watched over them
for hours, just in case.

525
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:22,579
You're all warmed up now, aren't ya?

526
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:27,334
I was surprised when the
groom put down his little box for a while,

527
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:31,004
and the frozen look he always had
on his face faded away.

528
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:53,109
That night, I had a terrible dream.

529
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:58,365
A horse was calling to me over and over
for help.

530
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,285
I realized it was Ginger.

531
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:14,673
We were trapped.

532
00:45:17,884 --> 00:45:22,472
I tried to sound a warning,
but Jo was too far away to hear me.

533
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:32,816
Beauty!

534
00:45:44,744 --> 00:45:46,371
- Couldn't leave the others.
- Okay.

535
00:45:46,454 --> 00:45:49,374
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Ginger and Merrylegs were still in there.

536
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:55,213
Just trust me. Please.

537
00:46:01,344 --> 00:46:02,220
Jo!

538
00:46:03,972 --> 00:46:05,682
It's okay. It's okay.

539
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:08,101
It's okay.

540
00:46:08,184 --> 00:46:09,811
- Jo!
- Help them!

541
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:12,230
Are you all right, Jo? Beauty.

542
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:15,650
- Jo. Jo! You gotta...
- Get that gate open!

543
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:17,110
-We have to help them!
-Jo!

544
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:19,446
Jo! Don't!

545
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:24,743
She's coming.

546
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:31,583
Where's Jo?

547
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:33,251
Jo wasn't coming out.

548
00:46:33,335 --> 00:46:34,794
-Where was she?
-Jo!

549
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:40,133
Jo!

550
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:51,269
Good God.

551
00:46:57,817 --> 00:46:59,819
As the stable went up in flames...

552
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:05,617
so did my newfound hope of a life with Jo.

553
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:20,674
It was because of Jo's
courage that the horses were all saved.

554
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:26,846
Her calm, steady voice
broke through my fear,

555
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:29,974
which was the only reason
I could even follow her.

556
00:47:33,603 --> 00:47:35,855
The young groom
didn't mean to hurt anyone,

557
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,275
but his carelessness put our lives
in danger...

558
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,946
and had destroyed our beautiful home.

559
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:48,952
It was the beginning of the end
at Birtwick.

560
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:54,332
- Mr. Gordon.
- Jo, what can I do for you?

561
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:55,917
Please, you can't sell Beauty.

562
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:59,879
I'm sorry, Jo.
All the trained horses have to be sold.

563
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:02,424
We just don't have the space
with all that damage.

564
00:48:02,507 --> 00:48:04,509
-But...
-You saved her life, Jo,

565
00:48:04,592 --> 00:48:06,136
in more ways than one.

566
00:48:06,928 --> 00:48:08,680
Don't you want to do that for more horses?

567
00:48:08,763 --> 00:48:12,058
Mr. Gordon, what if I could buy her?

568
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:13,226
Sorry?

569
00:48:13,309 --> 00:48:15,729
I could work for you.
Help train the others,

570
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:17,689
rebuild the barn, anything you need.

571
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:20,025
Every morning, every day after school.

572
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:22,986
Look, I just don't know
if that's the right thing to do.

573
00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:24,446
Uncle John, please.

574
00:48:24,529 --> 00:48:26,156
He can't take Beauty away.

575
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:33,496
Well, it is only after working with Beauty
that your grades have improved.

576
00:48:34,664 --> 00:48:36,833
You haven't gotten into another fight
at school.

577
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:38,168
Exactly.

578
00:48:38,251 --> 00:48:41,838
The trouble, Jo,
is boarding Beauty is very expensive.

579
00:48:42,964 --> 00:48:43,965
All right.

580
00:48:46,843 --> 00:48:47,844
I tell you what.

581
00:48:48,678 --> 00:48:51,890
If you can pay for her food
and what she's cost us so far

582
00:48:52,557 --> 00:48:54,976
by the end of summer, she's yours.

583
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:03,818
And you can board her here for free
in exchange for being Birtwick's mascot.

584
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:04,944
Are you serious?

585
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:07,405
Look,
don't make me overthink this.

586
00:49:08,948 --> 00:49:09,949
All right.

587
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,202
Thank you, Mr. Gordon.

588
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:15,080
Thank you, Uncle John.

589
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:17,415
But there's one thing
you need to understand.

590
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:20,251
There's a chance I might lease Beauty out
for the summer,

591
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:23,755
just to free up space while we build
the new stable, if anybody wants her.

592
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:27,801
-Deal?
-Deal.

593
00:49:43,566 --> 00:49:46,820
-I'm so sorry about the stable, Mr. Manly.
-Thank you.

594
00:49:46,903 --> 00:49:49,781
-It's absolutely disgusting here, Mother.
-Darling, quiet.

595
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:51,741
George Winthorp.

596
00:49:52,784 --> 00:49:53,952
I mean, seriously.

597
00:49:54,035 --> 00:49:58,373
This filly is spirited, but a fine jumper
with a right gentle touch.

598
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:03,378
-He's just, like, totally ideal.
-Do you think he knows who we are?

599
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:05,964
I mean, yeah.
I feel like he's looked at me before.

600
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:09,342
My gosh. Mum, look at that horse.

601
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:13,596
- Well, isn't that a mustang?
- So?

602
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,683
-Darling, you want a thoroughbred.
-Everyone has a thoroughbred.

603
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:19,561
She's a Pryor mustang, isn't she?

604
00:50:20,353 --> 00:50:21,938
You know your horses.

605
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:24,107
She's so beautiful.

606
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:27,444
And that's the funny thing,
but that's her name. Beauty.

607
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:30,780
-But like your mother said, you probably...
-Is she for sale?

608
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:33,324
No. She's not for sale.

609
00:50:34,075 --> 00:50:37,328
She's, She's for lease.

610
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:38,788
Wow!

611
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:40,623
Is it even rideable?

612
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:43,918
She is.
My niece was the one to gentle her.

613
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:48,798
But look, we... we've got plenty of horses.

614
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,468
- Good.
- Go and speak to him.

615
00:50:51,551 --> 00:50:54,763
Do it for both of us.
Don't mess it up. Okay, go.

616
00:50:54,846 --> 00:50:57,349
But...
we got all sorts of horses, so...

617
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:59,976
- Yes, all sorts, darling.
- No, Mummy. I want that one.

618
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,227
- Let's go.
- What happened?

619
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:03,605
-I said let's go.
-Why didn't you just talk to him?

620
00:51:03,688 --> 00:51:06,316
Because it was a stupid idea
and a ridiculous situation.

621
00:51:06,399 --> 00:51:07,776
Why... No, it wasn't.

622
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:08,902
Hello.

623
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:11,404
Hi.

624
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:16,034
I heard you were the one
to break this beautiful filly.

625
00:51:16,117 --> 00:51:17,535
Well, partnered.

626
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:22,290
You mean, like,
partnering instead of breaking.

627
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:24,834
I like that.

628
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:28,088
She was nervous around him.

629
00:51:28,171 --> 00:51:30,090
I'm George, by the way.

630
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:32,801
Jo.

631
00:51:32,884 --> 00:51:34,552
I think Jo thought he was handsome.

632
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:37,138
-Sorry.
-What for?

633
00:51:38,264 --> 00:51:40,225
Yay!

634
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:41,935
- Good.
- What's going on over there?

635
00:51:42,977 --> 00:51:45,105
I think my sister just leased your horse.

636
00:51:45,939 --> 00:51:46,940
What?

637
00:51:57,659 --> 00:51:59,077
You'll bunk with another groom.

638
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:02,497
They've agreed to pay you
a flat weekly rate at 200.

639
00:52:03,873 --> 00:52:04,874
Thank you.

640
00:52:07,335 --> 00:52:08,837
But, wait, why did they agree?

641
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:15,343
Well, I told them it would be beneficial
to Beauty's transition

642
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:18,263
and much, much safer for the girl
if you were there.

643
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:23,101
We're done, Ms. Green.

644
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:27,564
All right.
See you in a couple weeks, Uncle John.

645
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:39,075
At Birtwick, I learned that
it is good people who make good places.

646
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:44,998
I felt lucky Ginger
was coming with us too.

647
00:52:49,794 --> 00:52:52,130
I wondered what our new home
would be like.

648
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:54,883
Wow.

649
00:53:11,107 --> 00:53:13,234
-I can help if...
-I got it. Thanks.

650
00:53:13,943 --> 00:53:15,403
They're here!

651
00:53:15,487 --> 00:53:18,031
Georgina, fine-looking horse
you have there.

652
00:53:18,114 --> 00:53:20,158
I'm proud you made the decision
to save her.

653
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:21,201
Can you take a photo?

654
00:53:22,285 --> 00:53:24,204
Not like that. Get my good side.

655
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:26,873
The new girl's voice was at a pitch

656
00:53:26,956 --> 00:53:29,167
I was sure only horses and dogs
could hear.

657
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:32,879
Not to be mean,
but it was a very terrible sound.

658
00:53:33,713 --> 00:53:36,091
You... you must be Jo?

659
00:53:36,174 --> 00:53:37,342
Yes.

660
00:53:37,425 --> 00:53:39,427
Mr. York. You'll report to me.

661
00:53:40,053 --> 00:53:42,347
Come on. I'll show you
your summer quarters.

662
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:46,142
This way.

663
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:48,103
George!

664
00:53:53,191 --> 00:53:54,275
George!

665
00:54:01,074 --> 00:54:03,368
Earlshall couldn't
have been more different to Birtwick.

666
00:54:04,786 --> 00:54:06,621
The aisles were spotless.

667
00:54:06,705 --> 00:54:08,790
The horses gleamed.

668
00:54:13,586 --> 00:54:15,296
But for all its perfection...

669
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:20,927
something about Earlshall felt very cold
and not nearly as welcoming.

670
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:24,681
Here we are.

671
00:54:26,391 --> 00:54:28,101
-These are the grooms quarters?
-Yup.

672
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:32,772
Ginger had been purchased.

673
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:34,816
I was only leased.

674
00:54:35,608 --> 00:54:38,945
Apparently you can try out a horse
to see if you like it.

675
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:47,620
You don't have to kick her that hard.
She will walk.

676
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:49,664
Let's just ease her into it, shall we?

677
00:54:49,748 --> 00:54:53,710
It was clear within
seconds. Georgina was nothing like Jo.

678
00:54:53,793 --> 00:54:56,588
Her hands were hard.
Her kicks were harder.

679
00:54:56,671 --> 00:55:00,884
And she flailed around like she was having
a tantrum on my back.

680
00:55:00,967 --> 00:55:02,052
- Gently now.
- Come on.

681
00:55:02,135 --> 00:55:04,679
We want a nice collected frame.

682
00:55:06,014 --> 00:55:09,642
York! The dressage,
you're going to have to get her head up!

683
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:10,935
My head is up, Mother.

684
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:12,937
No, the horse, darling.

685
00:55:14,272 --> 00:55:17,067
Beauty's never been on a draw rein, ma'am.

686
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:20,195
Well, then you need to get her used to it
because she's not fit to be seen.

687
00:55:21,654 --> 00:55:23,656
Shoulder's back, Georgina.

688
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:35,168
She needs to look more like a show horse.
Cut her mane and tail.

689
00:55:42,592 --> 00:55:44,552
I tried to stay patient.

690
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:49,015
I wondered how she'd feel
if they chopped off all of her hair.

691
00:55:52,727 --> 00:55:56,106
The art of dressage
is to create a healthy horse.

692
00:55:56,731 --> 00:55:59,984
We want to give her the freedom
to express herself.

693
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:02,737
York, I'm really not in the mood today.
Canter, Beauty.

694
00:56:10,745 --> 00:56:14,499
York, are you never
going to get the horses head up?

695
00:56:14,582 --> 00:56:18,294
I could take it up another degree, ma'am,
but I'd prefer not to.

696
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:20,213
Do it, please.

697
00:56:21,631 --> 00:56:26,136
The only thing worse
than Georgina's kicks was the draw rein.

698
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:30,223
It forced my head down into my chest
so I couldn't breathe naturally.

699
00:56:30,932 --> 00:56:33,893
-I tried to remember my training...
-What's she doing?

700
00:56:33,977 --> 00:56:36,312
...but the way I was treated
made me angry.

701
00:56:38,523 --> 00:56:39,858
Give her a head.

702
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:43,695
I knew that if I threw her
off, Jo and I would both be in trouble,

703
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:47,407
- so I had a better idea.
- What's wrong with her?

704
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:48,908
Georgina, what are you doing?

705
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:51,494
Nothing. It's the stupid horse!

706
00:56:55,123 --> 00:56:56,666
That's it. Jump out the way.

707
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,293
What's she doing? Stupid horse!

708
00:56:59,627 --> 00:57:01,212
- Stupid horse!
- Georgina, I've got...

709
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:07,802
Beauty, you're a cracker!

710
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:12,849
What a wonderful horse you are!

711
00:57:14,934 --> 00:57:18,605
Well, my sister is definitely
not a horse woman.

712
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:24,444
You wanna be tending to her, don't you?

713
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:29,240
Grooming Beauty
is apparently above my station here.

714
00:57:32,535 --> 00:57:35,121
How are you finding things otherwise?

715
00:57:36,247 --> 00:57:39,793
Fine. Just trying to keep to myself.

716
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:41,836
Birtwick was one thing.

717
00:57:42,587 --> 00:57:46,174
This is definitely not my world.

718
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:52,138
It's a big place, but that doesn't mean
the people are any different.

719
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:55,392
Not all of us anyway.

720
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,814
I'll speak to York about you
tending to Beauty.

721
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,358
She's your horse, in my opinion.

722
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,320
I'll see you around.

723
00:58:25,505 --> 00:58:29,634
I heard my son put a word in so
that you could spend time with the horse.

724
00:58:29,718 --> 00:58:32,012
Yes, um...

725
00:58:32,095 --> 00:58:33,430
Thank you. I...

726
00:58:33,513 --> 00:58:35,682
Unfortunately it's inappropriate.

727
00:58:35,765 --> 00:58:37,809
And it's upsetting Georgina,

728
00:58:37,892 --> 00:58:41,187
so you're going to need
to keep your distance.

729
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:45,191
You wouldn't want to compromise
your place here, would you?

730
00:58:45,275 --> 00:58:47,527
No, no. Of course not.

731
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:49,237
Good, then we understand each other.

732
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:51,406
About appropriate distance.

733
00:59:00,331 --> 00:59:04,377
I didn't think Georgina
would wanna ride me again after that,

734
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:05,837
but she did.

735
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:10,800
Now you'll listen, won't you?

736
00:59:12,135 --> 00:59:15,597
She dug her spurs into me
like I was made of stone.

737
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:19,059
And if it wasn't for Jo,

738
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:22,729
I would've thrown that horrible girl
off my back.

739
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:31,488
Hi, girl.

740
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:40,747
Beauty.

741
00:59:43,541 --> 00:59:44,793
What did she do to you?

742
00:59:48,338 --> 00:59:50,340
- Jo!
- Where is she?

743
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:52,175
Who? What happened?

744
00:59:52,258 --> 00:59:54,928
Your sister put holes into Beauty's sides,
and I'm gonna show her exactly...

745
00:59:55,011 --> 00:59:56,429
Whoa. Wait, wait. Slow down.

746
00:59:57,555 --> 00:59:58,807
Tell me what happened.

747
01:00:00,725 --> 01:00:01,726
My God.

748
01:00:03,853 --> 01:00:07,607
That is not okay.
We do not abuse horses at our stable.

749
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:13,488
Here, dab some of that onto them.
It'll make her heal faster.

750
01:00:15,448 --> 01:00:18,576
Thanks for your help, really.
But now I need to find your...

751
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,370
Jo, please.

752
01:00:20,453 --> 01:00:23,039
I'll talk to York and my mother,
I promise.

753
01:00:24,207 --> 01:00:28,503
Besides, Beauty needs you here, not fired.

754
01:00:36,636 --> 01:00:40,265
I know he's... He's nice and...

755
01:00:41,349 --> 01:00:42,350
smart.

756
01:00:49,607 --> 01:00:51,776
And very...

757
01:00:53,236 --> 01:00:55,363
handsome.

758
01:00:56,406 --> 01:00:58,158
-Hey.
-Hi.

759
01:00:58,908 --> 01:01:01,244
I wanted to ask if you'd like
to have lunch with me.

760
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:05,373
I'm fine. I'd rather spend
my one day off with Beauty.

761
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:07,584
I decided to give them some space.

762
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:08,626
I figured.

763
01:01:16,801 --> 01:01:19,220
So, what's your story?

764
01:01:20,221 --> 01:01:22,057
I don't really have a story.

765
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,641
Everyone has a story.

766
01:01:24,476 --> 01:01:25,477
Where are you from?

767
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:29,898
What's a beautiful girl like you
doing working as a groom?

768
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:32,525
You know, the basics.

769
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:36,613
I'd rather not talk about my past,
if that's okay.

770
01:01:36,696 --> 01:01:37,822
Fair enough.

771
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,075
How about the future?

772
01:01:41,242 --> 01:01:43,078
What do you wanna do in ten years?

773
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:46,331
You can pick anything. I'll start.

774
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:50,877
I would colonize Mars.

775
01:01:54,589 --> 01:01:59,094
Well, I would rescue horses.
Like what my uncle's doing at Birtwick.

776
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:02,681
Except, you know,
I'd buy the properties around it,

777
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:04,933
extend the barn
so we could stay a little more.

778
01:02:05,016 --> 01:02:07,060
Sorry, it's probably really boring.

779
01:02:07,143 --> 01:02:08,311
No.

780
01:02:08,978 --> 01:02:09,979
I'm fascinated.

781
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:21,199
So, I've been reading about how there
are thousands of wild horses out west,

782
01:02:21,282 --> 01:02:25,036
and they're being rounded up by
helicopters and stuffed into holding pens,

783
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,664
just hoping that people will adopt them,

784
01:02:27,747 --> 01:02:30,875
but most of them
are just stuck in there forever.

785
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:36,172
I can't imagine what would've happened
to Beauty if my uncle didn't save her.

786
01:02:37,507 --> 01:02:43,138
So I guess I would buy Birtwick
and help save thousands of wild horses.

787
01:02:44,514 --> 01:02:45,765
With Beauty as the mascot.

788
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,185
That is a way better answer than Mars.

789
01:02:51,438 --> 01:02:52,439
Bet you do it.

790
01:02:56,109 --> 01:02:57,110
So...

791
01:02:58,194 --> 01:03:02,032
my parents are hosting their
annual Earlshall Classic this weekend.

792
01:03:02,699 --> 01:03:05,452
It's a cross-country race
around the grounds.

793
01:03:07,078 --> 01:03:08,830
Everyone who's anyone comes.

794
01:03:10,373 --> 01:03:11,458
Whatever that means.

795
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:12,792
Okay.

796
01:03:14,502 --> 01:03:16,212
Would you wanna be my date?

797
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:17,881
Me?

798
01:03:17,964 --> 01:03:20,216
Well, I don't see another Jo Green around.

799
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:22,761
I couldn't.

800
01:03:22,844 --> 01:03:24,220
You could.

801
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:25,430
I work for you.

802
01:03:25,513 --> 01:03:27,432
You work for my parents.

803
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:29,559
It's casual, really.

804
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:33,355
Beauty thinks you should.

805
01:03:34,147 --> 01:03:37,233
You should always listen to your horse.

806
01:03:37,317 --> 01:03:39,736
-Yes, but...
-Excellent.

807
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:43,448
I'll leave your name at the VIP box.

808
01:03:46,409 --> 01:03:48,078
The VIP box?

809
01:03:51,164 --> 01:03:52,791
Hello. How are you?

810
01:03:54,834 --> 01:03:56,753
You made it.

811
01:03:56,836 --> 01:03:59,214
The humans were all so clean.

812
01:03:59,297 --> 01:04:01,174
They wore the funniest hats.

813
01:04:01,257 --> 01:04:05,595
And I loved the music.
It made me wanna dance.

814
01:04:10,141 --> 01:04:14,521
And that's Mr. Bradley Eastland
on Just Magic at the finish,

815
01:04:14,604 --> 01:04:16,940
taking home the cup
for the youth competition.

816
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:20,527
And next up, the Men's Invitational.

817
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:22,278
Hi, George.

818
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:28,326
-Where's George? Is that George?
-He's waiting for the next race. At last.

819
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:33,790
How many is that, darling?

820
01:04:33,873 --> 01:04:35,417
Darling, just enough.

821
01:04:36,501 --> 01:04:39,504
Georgina was so helpless
I almost felt bad for her.

822
01:04:40,088 --> 01:04:42,924
She wouldn't last one day in the wild.

823
01:04:55,311 --> 01:04:58,273
-I thought you said this was casual.
-It is casual.

824
01:04:58,356 --> 01:05:00,525
On the scale of my mother's events anyway.

825
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:03,737
You look stunning.

826
01:05:04,863 --> 01:05:05,947
Thank you.

827
01:05:08,658 --> 01:05:10,160
Who's that pretty girl?

828
01:05:10,243 --> 01:05:11,995
-Where, darling?
-There.

829
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:15,248
Hi, Ginger. You look ready to race.

830
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:16,708
God.

831
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:18,835
God.
Our son's fraternizing with the help.

832
01:05:18,918 --> 01:05:20,545
What's wrong with that?

833
01:05:21,504 --> 01:05:22,756
She's of no means.

834
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:23,965
Yes.

835
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:26,468
And neither were you when we got married.

836
01:05:30,055 --> 01:05:31,348
Where's Beauty?

837
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:41,858
Wish me luck.

838
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:44,069
Good luck.

839
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:51,701
Come on.

840
01:05:53,203 --> 01:05:55,955
- Come on!
- Whoo! Go!

841
01:05:57,999 --> 01:05:59,959
-Go, George. Come on!
-That's it. Come on, George!

842
01:06:01,419 --> 01:06:02,629
Beauty!

843
01:06:03,088 --> 01:06:04,673
Wow. He's so fast.

844
01:06:04,756 --> 01:06:06,383
He's a lot of things.

845
01:06:08,259 --> 01:06:09,552
Come on, George!

846
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:10,470
Come on!

847
01:06:10,553 --> 01:06:12,305
Come on, Ginger!

848
01:06:13,306 --> 01:06:14,224
Yes!

849
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:21,731
George Winthorp, taking
home the cup for the third year running.

850
01:06:21,815 --> 01:06:23,274
Yes!

851
01:06:29,155 --> 01:06:31,741
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

852
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:35,662
the final event for the day,
the Women's Invitational.

853
01:06:35,745 --> 01:06:37,872
- Darling, look. There's Georgina.
- Yeah.

854
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:40,625
She looks beautiful. Yes!

855
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:48,049
-Hey.
-Hi.

856
01:06:48,133 --> 01:06:49,926
Congratulations.

857
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:51,177
Thank you, Jo.

858
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:52,721
It was all Ginger.

859
01:06:53,888 --> 01:06:55,807
I may not have liked Georgina,

860
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:58,768
but I wanted to win.

861
01:06:58,852 --> 01:07:00,020
On my signal!

862
01:07:04,232 --> 01:07:05,442
Come on, Beauty!

863
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:08,695
Faster, Beauty!

864
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:14,159
Go!

865
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,248
I tried to listen...

866
01:07:20,331 --> 01:07:23,335
-Yes!
-...but she was pushing me too hard.

867
01:07:27,297 --> 01:07:29,132
She wasn't Jo.

868
01:07:29,215 --> 01:07:31,301
Georgina had no idea what she was doing.

869
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:34,596
Something's wrong.

870
01:07:34,679 --> 01:07:36,222
Her gait's off.

871
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:39,642
-Without my shoe, jumping was dangerous.
-Come on. Go!

872
01:07:39,726 --> 01:07:42,562
Still, she forced me to keep going.

873
01:07:42,645 --> 01:07:44,189
Come on. Come on.

874
01:07:55,408 --> 01:07:57,327
Faster!

875
01:08:12,509 --> 01:08:14,386
My God. Darling, run!

876
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:16,221
- Beauty!
- Don't worry.

877
01:08:16,304 --> 01:08:18,348
Only thing that's bruised is her ego.

878
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:23,895
Useless horse! We could've won!

879
01:08:26,064 --> 01:08:29,567
She was limping at the first turn,
but you forced her to keep going.

880
01:08:30,777 --> 01:08:32,445
Did you even know her shoe was loose?

881
01:08:32,529 --> 01:08:35,740
Selfish girl! Putting your life
and the horse's in danger.

882
01:08:35,824 --> 01:08:38,076
Aw, Georgina.
Are you all right?

883
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:39,661
Does it hurt?

884
01:08:39,744 --> 01:08:41,287
Come on. Come with Mummy.

885
01:08:41,371 --> 01:08:42,789
- Are you all right?
- No!

886
01:08:42,872 --> 01:08:45,083
Of course she's not all right!

887
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:47,043
Beauty.

888
01:08:47,585 --> 01:08:50,213
I know. I know. Come on.

889
01:08:57,846 --> 01:09:00,473
Good girl. Good girl.

890
01:09:01,307 --> 01:09:03,935
She didn't break a leg, miraculously.

891
01:09:04,686 --> 01:09:07,856
Whoever did this,
shouldn't be around horses.

892
01:09:08,565 --> 01:09:11,943
Unfortunately these scars
will last for a lifetime,

893
01:09:12,027 --> 01:09:14,320
-but there is a surgery if you want me...
-No, no, no.

894
01:09:14,404 --> 01:09:16,406
We're not spending any more money
on this horse.

895
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:19,951
I told you that we shouldn't have brought
a mustang into our stables.

896
01:09:20,035 --> 01:09:21,536
Just send it back.

897
01:09:21,619 --> 01:09:24,330
Y-You... You can't do that, Mother. Jo...

898
01:09:24,414 --> 01:09:27,959
I can do whatever I want, George.
And stay away from the help.

899
01:09:28,043 --> 01:09:30,086
-The help?
-Yes, George. The help.

900
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:32,255
Jo is ten times the person you are.

901
01:09:34,549 --> 01:09:36,217
Our time at Earlshall had tested us.

902
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:37,302
George!

903
01:09:37,385 --> 01:09:39,596
But Jo and I were stronger because of it.

904
01:09:40,805 --> 01:09:43,183
I respected George for standing up
to his mother.

905
01:09:43,266 --> 01:09:44,267
George!

906
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:48,563
He had inherited her good
breeding but none of her nasty spirit.

907
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:55,612
Jo had worked so hard,
and it was almost time to go home.

908
01:09:56,821 --> 01:09:58,615
But I would miss Ginger.

909
01:10:04,245 --> 01:10:08,208
So, I've saved up over $800,
and I've done the math.

910
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:10,585
It should be enough
to pay back Mr. Gordon,

911
01:10:10,669 --> 01:10:14,089
and if I just keep going,
I can finally take her away from here.

912
01:10:14,172 --> 01:10:15,173
Jo.

913
01:10:18,259 --> 01:10:20,178
Wait, why are you visiting again?

914
01:10:21,137 --> 01:10:22,639
I have terrible news.

915
01:10:26,184 --> 01:10:29,020
Birtwick was closing down for good.

916
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:33,024
All of the animals in it
were going to be sold.

917
01:10:34,275 --> 01:10:35,527
You're my family.

918
01:10:37,654 --> 01:10:38,905
You know that, right?

919
01:10:40,990 --> 01:10:42,534
I'm gonna find you.

920
01:10:43,618 --> 01:10:46,371
I'm gonna save up enough money,
and I'm gonna find you.

921
01:10:46,996 --> 01:10:50,291
My heart stopped. My legs went numb.

922
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:51,543
I promise.

923
01:10:52,377 --> 01:10:54,504
I felt like I couldn't even breathe.

924
01:10:55,922 --> 01:10:57,340
Jo was leaving me?

925
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:16,901
- I cried. I screamed.
- Wait!

926
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,656
Wait! Beauty!

927
01:11:22,282 --> 01:11:25,869
I pounded my hooves against
that trailer to get them to stop.

928
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:31,374
But it was just too late.

929
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:36,129
The only thing I could do was look back
at Jo's sweet face

930
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,717
as she disappeared
from my life completely.

931
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:53,688
Losing Jo made my old anger come back.

932
01:11:55,065 --> 01:11:57,067
I began to bite and kick,

933
01:11:57,942 --> 01:12:00,612
anything I could do to make them
send me home.

934
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:04,282
- Hey.
- But my plan didn't work.

935
01:12:04,366 --> 01:12:05,784
What's up, pretty lady?

936
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:08,536
-My new owner liked the fire in me.
-Yeah.

937
01:12:09,829 --> 01:12:13,875
I never thought I'd say goodbye
to Birtwick. I'm so sorry, Jo.

938
01:12:17,253 --> 01:12:22,509
A few years ago, I fell in love
with this little bay mustang

939
01:12:22,592 --> 01:12:25,053
we rescued from the BLM in Nevada.

940
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:29,557
He was half-starved but so darn pretty.

941
01:12:31,017 --> 01:12:32,644
I called him Beau.

942
01:12:33,603 --> 01:12:37,190
They say horses pick you,
and Beau picked me.

943
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:41,486
I trained him up right,
and he was a perfect horse.

944
01:12:42,529 --> 01:12:46,991
Boy, I cried like a baby
when we gave him away.

945
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:49,536
And you didn't fight to keep him?

946
01:12:52,872 --> 01:12:55,875
If I'd fought for every horse
I'd ever loved,

947
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:57,836
I'd have a hundred of 'em.

948
01:12:58,795 --> 01:13:00,463
I don't want a hundred horses.

949
01:13:02,716 --> 01:13:04,384
I just want one.

950
01:13:06,052 --> 01:13:09,222
I'm gonna get Beauty back,
Uncle John, no matter what.

951
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:17,647
I was bought by a man named Terry

952
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:20,734
to help him search for people
lost in the mountains.

953
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:27,073
Being in nature again brought up
old memories of when I was wild.

954
01:13:28,783 --> 01:13:30,869
It seemed like a lifetime ago.

955
01:13:33,163 --> 01:13:36,791
Terry was a quiet man and good to me,

956
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:39,544
but I couldn't help
but think Jo had been right.

957
01:13:40,962 --> 01:13:44,341
We should've run away
together when we had the chance.

958
01:13:44,841 --> 01:13:47,260
Fell for a pretty, little mustang,
hey, Terry?

959
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:49,512
Well, I think she's lovely.

960
01:13:50,638 --> 01:13:53,266
And more accustomed to this kinda terra.

961
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:59,939
My new life required
a different side of me.

962
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:04,736
I had to be bolder and more fearless
than ever before.

963
01:14:06,529 --> 01:14:08,031
It's getting a little dicey here.

964
01:14:09,491 --> 01:14:11,493
She can do it. Come on.

965
01:14:11,576 --> 01:14:14,329
Come on. That's my brave horse.

966
01:14:14,412 --> 01:14:15,955
Terry, stop. It's too steep.

967
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:25,298
I spent two years
in the mountains with Terry...

968
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:28,635
and we did many brave rescues.

969
01:14:30,887 --> 01:14:33,556
It was hard, lonely work...

970
01:14:35,266 --> 01:14:37,686
but I learned new lessons
about being selfless.

971
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:45,443
Terry and I risked our lives every day
for people we'd never met.

972
01:14:45,527 --> 01:14:49,531
That's my girl. That's my girl.

973
01:14:51,157 --> 01:14:55,745
If Jo could see me now,
I hope she would be proud of me.

974
01:14:57,622 --> 01:14:59,791
Hey! Help me, please!

975
01:14:59,874 --> 01:15:01,042
Hang on in there!

976
01:15:01,626 --> 01:15:02,752
Hold on in there!

977
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:04,671
- Please hurry!
- I'm coming!

978
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:06,881
My leg is stuck!

979
01:15:08,341 --> 01:15:11,136
I stood my ground the best I could...

980
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:15,015
but the will of the river
was just so strong.

981
01:15:15,098 --> 01:15:15,974
I got ya!

982
01:15:16,057 --> 01:15:20,770
But Terry was determined
to save that man, and so was I.

983
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:22,355
Hold tight there! I'm coming!

984
01:15:30,363 --> 01:15:32,907
Only once in my life
had I seen a river overflow,

985
01:15:33,825 --> 01:15:35,952
- and it wiped out everything in its path.
- Please!

986
01:15:36,036 --> 01:15:38,079
My leg is stuck! I can't move it!

987
01:15:43,084 --> 01:15:46,212
The water was coming down
the mountain too fast.

988
01:15:47,255 --> 01:15:49,424
- You're gonna have to help me!
- Okay.

989
01:15:49,507 --> 01:15:50,467
He had to hurry.

990
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:55,305
Hold on!

991
01:16:05,065 --> 01:16:07,233
Come on!

992
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:10,445
We weren't going to make it.

993
01:16:17,035 --> 01:16:18,078
Save yourself, girl.

994
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:30,590
I didn't know if a mustang
had ever outrun a river...

995
01:16:32,092 --> 01:16:33,927
but I was going to try.

996
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:54,197
Come on!

997
01:17:19,305 --> 01:17:21,975
Engine 5, Dispatch. Requesting backup.

998
01:17:22,809 --> 01:17:24,185
We had done it.

999
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:27,647
I had never galloped as fast

1000
01:17:27,731 --> 01:17:29,524
or as hard in my life as I did that day.

1001
01:17:30,358 --> 01:17:32,027
We've gotta get you to the hospital.

1002
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:34,654
And I was proud to be Terry's partner.

1003
01:17:34,738 --> 01:17:36,406
Don't worry, sir. We'll tend to her.

1004
01:17:36,489 --> 01:17:38,992
Tanner, get the horse's bridle
and saddle off,

1005
01:17:39,075 --> 01:17:40,827
and make sure she has plenty to drink.

1006
01:17:42,412 --> 01:17:44,622
She was a hero today.
Come on, sir. Let's get going.

1007
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:47,292
I think Jo
would have been proud of us too.

1008
01:17:49,377 --> 01:17:52,464
Goodness, girl. Your coat's on fire.

1009
01:17:54,799 --> 01:17:55,925
Okay. Come.

1010
01:17:57,093 --> 01:18:01,931
Like the freezing river
water, the cold air rushed into my lungs.

1011
01:18:04,809 --> 01:18:07,228
But the man didn't know anything
about horses.

1012
01:18:08,646 --> 01:18:11,900
So, he left me without my blanket.

1013
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:18,698
My legs began to shake so hard
I couldn't even stand.

1014
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:23,203
I turned cold all over.

1015
01:18:31,252 --> 01:18:34,214
No. No, stupid kid.

1016
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:36,383
Stupid kid.

1017
01:18:39,219 --> 01:18:41,179
My brave horse.

1018
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:46,518
Come on, my girl. Get up. Get up.

1019
01:18:49,479 --> 01:18:53,149
It's colic. Her lungs are badly inflamed.
I've given her something for the pain.

1020
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:56,820
Let's hope she has the strength
to make it through.

1021
01:19:02,951 --> 01:19:07,956
Terry stayed with me
all night as my mind went into a haze.

1022
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,502
I fought to stay awake...

1023
01:19:14,254 --> 01:19:16,506
but I could feel my spirit slipping.

1024
01:19:21,344 --> 01:19:25,181
Then... I saw Jo.

1025
01:19:35,233 --> 01:19:36,735
Just hold on for me.

1026
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:42,907
I'm gonna find you.

1027
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:46,661
I promise.

1028
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:50,165
I'm gonna find you.

1029
01:19:51,875 --> 01:19:53,626
I love you, Beauty.

1030
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:58,673
I don't know if it was a dream...

1031
01:19:59,716 --> 01:20:02,135
or if Jo had managed to find me somehow.

1032
01:20:07,098 --> 01:20:08,183
You're up.

1033
01:20:08,266 --> 01:20:11,227
- Terry was a good man.
- My. My girl, you are up.

1034
01:20:11,311 --> 01:20:13,646
But he was getting older like me.

1035
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:17,150
He decided to retire.

1036
01:20:18,068 --> 01:20:20,487
So, I was sold again.

1037
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:27,118
I was sent to a place
so far in the country,

1038
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:30,121
the farmers still used old tools to work.

1039
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:37,128
He had promised Terry he would take
good care of me, but the farmer lied.

1040
01:20:39,839 --> 01:20:41,466
When I felt like giving up,

1041
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:44,844
something my mother said
kept coming back to me.

1042
01:20:46,096 --> 01:20:49,849
When she told me it was impossible
to break a mustang's spirit...

1043
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:54,354
and that if things ever got really hard...

1044
01:20:56,439 --> 01:21:01,695
that I should close my eyes
and dream of only good things...

1045
01:21:03,196 --> 01:21:05,615
and that good things would return.

1046
01:21:07,283 --> 01:21:09,285
I dreamed of Jo.

1047
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:19,129
I remembered back
to when we were young... and free.

1048
01:21:21,047 --> 01:21:22,966
But it had been so long.

1049
01:21:24,092 --> 01:21:25,760
Would she even remember me?

1050
01:21:28,722 --> 01:21:33,393
I tried to imagine
where Jo could be right now.

1051
01:21:38,815 --> 01:21:39,816
Dear Uncle John...

1052
01:21:42,652 --> 01:21:45,864
Winter in the city really is beautiful.

1053
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:48,700
I've been working extra shifts,

1054
01:21:48,783 --> 01:21:52,203
and I've almost saved up
enough money to buy Beauty back.

1055
01:21:53,538 --> 01:21:56,041
But now, I can't seem to find her.

1056
01:21:57,876 --> 01:21:59,544
It's like she disappeared.

1057
01:22:00,545 --> 01:22:03,840
I knew it was just another dream,

1058
01:22:03,923 --> 01:22:08,636
but some days, when I thought
I could almost hear Jo's voice,

1059
01:22:09,387 --> 01:22:16,353
I whinnied as loudly as I could just
in case somehow she could hear me too.

1060
01:22:17,103 --> 01:22:21,733
I'll never stop searching for her.
Love, Jo.

1061
01:22:32,869 --> 01:22:35,789
It had been almost
seven years since I'd last seen Jo.

1062
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:39,584
We bought a horse.

1063
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:42,170
But hope can be a very powerful thing

1064
01:22:42,253 --> 01:22:44,964
if you can manage to hang on to it.

1065
01:22:45,048 --> 01:22:47,384
Bit more broken up than we want her to be,
yeah, Jerry?

1066
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:49,594
Dolly picked her out, actually.

1067
01:22:49,678 --> 01:22:53,139
She's beautiful underneath.
She's just tired. That's all.

1068
01:22:53,223 --> 01:22:56,101
You're right, honey. You should
never judge a book by its cover.

1069
01:22:59,062 --> 01:23:01,064
My new stall
was the smallest I'd ever been in.

1070
01:23:01,147 --> 01:23:02,232
Easy now. There you go.

1071
01:23:02,315 --> 01:23:04,025
And there were no pastures in sight.

1072
01:23:04,109 --> 01:23:04,943
That's it.

1073
01:23:05,026 --> 01:23:06,820
Only concrete and walls.

1074
01:23:06,903 --> 01:23:08,530
Let's get her settled in.

1075
01:23:08,613 --> 01:23:11,449
I was scared
to be left alone in that place.

1076
01:23:24,629 --> 01:23:28,133
Dolly reminded me of Jo,
and her touch was kind.

1077
01:23:28,216 --> 01:23:29,467
It's okay.

1078
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:32,512
Like she knew exactly how to calm me.

1079
01:23:35,348 --> 01:23:37,100
Slow down around the horses.

1080
01:23:38,643 --> 01:23:41,521
I bet she was an amazing horse
when she was younger.

1081
01:23:41,604 --> 01:23:44,524
And she will be again
with some good treatment.

1082
01:23:45,608 --> 01:23:47,402
What do you think we should name her, Jer?

1083
01:23:47,485 --> 01:23:50,613
I was thinking Jackie, after the old one.
What do you think, guys?

1084
01:23:50,697 --> 01:23:53,783
How about Lady? Because she's so elegant.

1085
01:23:54,951 --> 01:23:56,703
Then the name is all hers.

1086
01:23:56,786 --> 01:23:59,664
That's a great idea, Dolly.
Lady it is.

1087
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:01,082
Lady.

1088
01:24:08,631 --> 01:24:11,384
Take your time. You're not in any rush.

1089
01:24:12,093 --> 01:24:14,554
The carriage was strange
to pull at first...

1090
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,098
but Jerry didn't force me.

1091
01:24:18,016 --> 01:24:19,017
What can I get ya?

1092
01:24:20,393 --> 01:24:24,939
I came to like the park
and all the faces in it.

1093
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:29,611
I knew I had found my way to the city
for a reason.

1094
01:24:37,077 --> 01:24:40,622
I couldn't believe how many people
visited that place.

1095
01:24:41,414 --> 01:24:42,916
- Thousands.
- Good girl.

1096
01:24:42,999 --> 01:24:47,837
And so I was sure,
that somehow, I would find Jo.

1097
01:24:50,256 --> 01:24:54,344
I missed her so much
that I started seeing her everywhere.

1098
01:24:54,427 --> 01:24:57,138
Whoa now. What's going on, Lady?

1099
01:24:58,932 --> 01:25:00,016
You looking for someone?

1100
01:25:02,143 --> 01:25:04,270
Want me to take you to brunch?

1101
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:06,231
Walk on.

1102
01:25:07,607 --> 01:25:09,609
But I would not give up hope.

1103
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:13,863
I knew in my heart I would find her.

1104
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:24,749
Every day, I looked.

1105
01:25:49,399 --> 01:25:51,359
I knew that horse.

1106
01:25:53,194 --> 01:25:54,696
It was Ginger.

1107
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:59,993
I couldn't believe how much she'd changed.

1108
01:26:01,327 --> 01:26:06,332
Ginger's once powerful body
was just skin and bones.

1109
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:12,547
The fire and life in her eyes
had been replaced by deep sadness.

1110
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:17,927
She told me she had won
many prizes for George,

1111
01:26:18,011 --> 01:26:19,721
but when he left for school,

1112
01:26:20,472 --> 01:26:24,476
his mother had sold her
without him even knowing.

1113
01:26:25,935 --> 01:26:29,272
- Hey, how much for a ride?
- I'm your man, boys.

1114
01:26:29,356 --> 01:26:33,151
While my mustang heart
could endure that hard life

1115
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:35,653
just for the hope of seeing Jo again...

1116
01:26:37,447 --> 01:26:40,909
I knew Ginger didn't have someone
to hope for anymore.

1117
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:46,498
I also knew it was the last time
I would ever see her.

1118
01:26:46,581 --> 01:26:49,334
Okay. Come on.

1119
01:26:49,417 --> 01:26:52,796
I'll never forget
Ginger's final words to me.

1120
01:26:52,879 --> 01:26:53,880
Careful.

1121
01:26:53,963 --> 01:26:59,969
She said Merrylegs and I
were the only friends she ever had.

1122
01:27:00,053 --> 01:27:01,054
Move on.

1123
01:27:11,356 --> 01:27:12,524
Beauty?

1124
01:27:13,316 --> 01:27:14,401
Move on, Lady.

1125
01:27:18,113 --> 01:27:21,282
Good girl. Good girl.

1126
01:27:23,576 --> 01:27:27,080
Thanks for getting through
a rough night, girl. You're a good...

1127
01:27:36,047 --> 01:27:37,632
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1128
01:27:38,258 --> 01:27:39,759
But Jerry wasn't fine.

1129
01:27:41,886 --> 01:27:45,724
The cold had climbed
into his lungs, just like when I was sick.

1130
01:27:57,068 --> 01:27:58,319
Hello, lovely one.

1131
01:27:58,403 --> 01:27:59,738
Nice looking horse.

1132
01:28:00,405 --> 01:28:03,324
The doctor said Jerry can't drive
for the rest of the winter,

1133
01:28:03,408 --> 01:28:05,160
maybe even until spring.

1134
01:28:06,703 --> 01:28:07,912
We need the money.

1135
01:28:08,788 --> 01:28:10,457
I can put her into my rotation.

1136
01:28:13,251 --> 01:28:14,419
All right.

1137
01:28:14,502 --> 01:28:16,796
After I was taken from Jo,

1138
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,466
I didn't think my life
could get any worse...

1139
01:28:20,467 --> 01:28:22,052
but I was wrong.

1140
01:28:22,135 --> 01:28:25,388
Nice and slow. Come on. That's okay.

1141
01:28:25,472 --> 01:28:28,975
The smells in that stable
reeked of mold and old hay.

1142
01:28:30,226 --> 01:28:33,480
The horses were mean from bad treatment.

1143
01:28:33,563 --> 01:28:35,982
I couldn't imagine what they'd want
from me next.

1144
01:28:36,066 --> 01:28:37,317
Buenas noches, Lady.

1145
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:43,448
The rotation meant
I was on my feet day and night.

1146
01:28:44,407 --> 01:28:46,326
-Jerry had been kind...
-Whoa, whoa. Easy.

1147
01:28:46,409 --> 01:28:48,661
-...and most drivers were like him...
-Easy, easy.

1148
01:28:48,745 --> 01:28:51,498
...but not all people
in the world are good.

1149
01:28:58,922 --> 01:29:00,131
Come on.

1150
01:29:11,351 --> 01:29:12,602
I knew it was Ginger.

1151
01:29:14,938 --> 01:29:17,774
She was at peace at last.

1152
01:29:20,568 --> 01:29:22,737
How could some people not understand

1153
01:29:22,821 --> 01:29:25,073
that horses can feel what they do?

1154
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:28,910
Jo knew that I could feel love
and sadness.

1155
01:29:28,993 --> 01:29:30,453
What's the matter with you? Come on!

1156
01:29:31,579 --> 01:29:35,250
But others thought it was
okay to just throw a horse's life away

1157
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:36,418
like it meant nothing.

1158
01:29:39,254 --> 01:29:41,089
And that broke my heart.

1159
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:47,721
I mean, where are the years that a horse
could work eight, ten hours a day?

1160
01:29:47,804 --> 01:29:49,139
But that was too many hours, Tom,

1161
01:29:49,222 --> 01:29:52,434
as evidenced by the fact that your horse
was outside on the streets yesterday.

1162
01:30:09,534 --> 01:30:10,535
Midtown Stables.

1163
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:14,330
Nope. No black horse in my barn.

1164
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:18,543
Yeah, yeah, I saw the papers.
Yeah, it's just terrible.

1165
01:30:19,252 --> 01:30:22,130
I bet you were hermosa back in your day.

1166
01:30:22,213 --> 01:30:23,548
Means pretty.

1167
01:30:23,631 --> 01:30:25,300
Sure, sure. I'll ask around.

1168
01:30:29,554 --> 01:30:33,183
You're a famous horse now. See?

1169
01:30:33,933 --> 01:30:35,310
She's useless if she can't work.

1170
01:30:35,393 --> 01:30:39,105
I have a guy who can take...
you know, take care of her.

1171
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:42,776
Yeah, but if you put her out to pasture,
she should recover in a couple of months.

1172
01:30:42,859 --> 01:30:44,444
Not worth the money.

1173
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:46,071
Nah.

1174
01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:49,324
Midtown Stables.

1175
01:30:50,408 --> 01:30:54,162
No, miss. I'm sorry. I really don't know
anything about that horse.

1176
01:30:55,663 --> 01:31:00,418
Just really terrible. Sure, sure.
I'll... I'll ask around.

1177
01:31:03,421 --> 01:31:05,298
Even more reason to be rid of it.

1178
01:31:05,382 --> 01:31:08,468
Hey. What are you doing in there?
Get back to work.

1179
01:31:08,551 --> 01:31:09,928
Yes, sir.

1180
01:31:11,888 --> 01:31:14,224
Well, Mr. Skinner,
thanks for coming around here.

1181
01:31:14,307 --> 01:31:16,976
I have this huge land.
I can take as many as you can give.

1182
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:19,020
Here's the first one.
She's gotten lame on me.

1183
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:22,899
The front leg. She's about 1,200 pounds.

1184
01:31:22,982 --> 01:31:26,528
This is what we agreed on for her,
and here's the other one we talked about.

1185
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:27,612
What, over there?

1186
01:31:28,321 --> 01:31:30,615
You should happily take her.
We got a deal?

1187
01:31:30,699 --> 01:31:32,450
- Absolutely.
- Great.

1188
01:31:32,534 --> 01:31:35,120
- Well, let me take you to the office.
- Now listen.

1189
01:31:35,203 --> 01:31:37,330
- You got any more, just phone me, okay?
- For sure.

1190
01:31:37,414 --> 01:31:39,541
I knew something bad was coming...

1191
01:31:41,167 --> 01:31:44,754
but I felt more sorry
for the little bay mare,

1192
01:31:44,838 --> 01:31:48,341
who was so exhausted,
she didn't care what happened to her.

1193
01:31:49,926 --> 01:31:54,556
I wondered if she ever had someone
to love her like Jo had loved me.

1194
01:31:55,849 --> 01:32:01,479
And I wished, somehow,
I could see her just one last time.

1195
01:32:08,028 --> 01:32:08,945
Hello.

1196
01:32:13,491 --> 01:32:16,244
A white star. Yes, she does.

1197
01:32:23,293 --> 01:32:26,129
Let's make this fast.
I don't like being here with these things.

1198
01:32:34,387 --> 01:32:36,431
- Which one?
- That's her there.

1199
01:32:37,307 --> 01:32:39,309
What the hell? Back.
Let's get back in there.

1200
01:32:40,685 --> 01:32:41,686
Stand still.

1201
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:43,730
I knew they had come for me.

1202
01:32:46,149 --> 01:32:49,527
But if it really was
the end, I wouldn't make it easy on them.

1203
01:32:49,611 --> 01:32:50,528
Whoa!

1204
01:32:54,115 --> 01:32:54,991
Back up, horse!

1205
01:32:55,617 --> 01:33:00,580
I was a mustang,
strong and proud and wild.

1206
01:33:00,663 --> 01:33:03,249
And I would defend myself
until my final breath.

1207
01:33:03,333 --> 01:33:05,627
-Jo would have wanted that.
-Get back, horse!

1208
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:07,671
My mother would have too.

1209
01:33:07,754 --> 01:33:10,006
My God, how did this pass code?

1210
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:12,550
Let's see some ID, fellas.

1211
01:33:12,634 --> 01:33:14,469
We've heard some rumors
about horses disappearing.

1212
01:33:14,552 --> 01:33:16,680
- Come on. Let me see.
- I've done nothing wrong.

1213
01:33:16,763 --> 01:33:17,764
- Come on.
- Let me see your ID.

1214
01:33:17,847 --> 01:33:19,474
- Have to take you in, man.
- This is wrong.

1215
01:33:19,557 --> 01:33:21,226
- Let us decide that.
- Seriously? Stop.

1216
01:33:21,309 --> 01:33:23,603
It doesn't matter, ma'am.
All right? Just...

1217
01:33:23,687 --> 01:33:25,563
- Please. Just let me go.
- Let the girl go!

1218
01:33:26,523 --> 01:33:27,524
Really.

1219
01:33:41,454 --> 01:33:42,455
Beauty?

1220
01:33:47,961 --> 01:33:49,045
Is that you, girl?

1221
01:33:54,801 --> 01:33:55,802
It's okay.

1222
01:33:59,723 --> 01:34:00,724
It's me.

1223
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:04,561
It's Jo.

1224
01:34:06,062 --> 01:34:08,732
Was it just another dream?

1225
01:34:15,405 --> 01:34:16,990
My Beauty.

1226
01:34:18,324 --> 01:34:20,076
I promised I'd find you.

1227
01:34:22,370 --> 01:34:24,039
It was really her.

1228
01:34:25,999 --> 01:34:27,709
My Jo.

1229
01:34:29,586 --> 01:34:30,587
My Beauty.

1230
01:34:35,967 --> 01:34:38,970
That was the happiest day of my life.

1231
01:34:40,221 --> 01:34:46,227
And I finally understood what it was that
kept Jo and I connected all that time.

1232
01:34:47,437 --> 01:34:52,108
It was because we shared
the same mustang spirit.

1233
01:34:55,695 --> 01:34:56,780
I'm so proud of you.

1234
01:35:03,495 --> 01:35:05,997
We've been looking for you
for a long time, Beauty.

1235
01:35:06,081 --> 01:35:08,708
Don't worry.
Your friends are coming with us.

1236
01:35:16,508 --> 01:35:17,926
Adiós, hermosa.

1237
01:35:24,599 --> 01:35:25,725
Let's go home.

1238
01:35:29,813 --> 01:35:32,399
I could smell the salt on the air again.

1239
01:35:33,983 --> 01:35:36,653
I was going home at last.

1240
01:35:40,615 --> 01:35:42,200
Jo had done it.

1241
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:52,627
I had never seen
such a funny little horse...

1242
01:35:54,421 --> 01:35:58,675
...except for Merrylegs.
And he had a family.

1243
01:35:58,758 --> 01:36:01,720
Remember your old friend?
I found him while I was looking for you.

1244
01:36:12,689 --> 01:36:13,690
You're home.

1245
01:36:17,444 --> 01:36:18,570
Anna...

1246
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:22,032
this... is Beauty.

1247
01:36:24,367 --> 01:36:25,702
Would you like to say hello?

1248
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:28,455
Hello.

1249
01:36:31,458 --> 01:36:33,543
Would you like to touch her nose?

1250
01:36:34,544 --> 01:36:35,795
It's very soft.

1251
01:36:36,755 --> 01:36:39,007
- She'll bite me.
- She will not.

1252
01:36:40,258 --> 01:36:41,551
We taught each other well...

1253
01:36:43,136 --> 01:36:44,471
a long time ago.

1254
01:36:53,146 --> 01:36:54,731
I thought you said she was wild.

1255
01:36:55,357 --> 01:36:58,693
She was... once.

1256
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,739
As wild as wild can be.

1257
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:05,575
She saved my life, you know.

1258
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,245
How could a horse save a person?

1259
01:37:11,623 --> 01:37:13,291
I'd love to tell you.

1260
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:18,880
So, when I was growing up,

1261
01:37:18,963 --> 01:37:22,592
something happened
that changed my life... forever.

1262
01:37:23,468 --> 01:37:26,054
And Beauty's actually why
I started this place.

1263
01:37:26,846 --> 01:37:30,850
I was so proud of who she had become.

1264
01:37:36,564 --> 01:37:39,984
Give him a good pat.
And tell him, "Thank you."

1265
01:37:41,611 --> 01:37:42,737
Thank you.

1266
01:37:43,363 --> 01:37:45,198
Always remember to say thank you.

1267
01:37:58,878 --> 01:38:00,463
Welcome home, Beauty.

1268
01:38:03,049 --> 01:38:04,050
Home.

1269
01:38:06,803 --> 01:38:10,223
I was finally back
where I was meant to be.

1270
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:49,929
A wise horse once told me...

1271
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:54,934
a mustang's spirit can never be broken.

1272
01:38:56,394 --> 01:38:58,772
That it has the strength of the ocean...

1273
01:38:59,856 --> 01:39:03,026
and lives forever, like the wind.

1274
01:39:05,737 --> 01:39:09,491
It took me a long time to realize
why that was true,

1275
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:13,870
but now I know it is
because a true mustang

1276
01:39:13,953 --> 01:39:18,124
never gives up on hope... or on love.

1277
01:39:23,213 --> 01:39:25,965
And as my final moments found me

1278
01:39:26,049 --> 01:39:29,052
and I galloped toward the sky...

1279
01:39:30,845 --> 01:39:34,099
I realized my mother was right.

1280
01:39:35,809 --> 01:39:39,229
It really did feel like flying.
