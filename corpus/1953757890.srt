00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
DIN

2
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:22,844


3
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:24,599


4
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:35,685
We have endured bitter
hardship and countless battles..

5
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:43,833
but at long last,
our home planet has been restored.

6
00:00:46,545 --> 00:00:47,970
We would not be standing on

7
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:52,141
Cybertronian soil were it not
for the valiant efforts of both

8
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:56,812
those assembled here..
and our absent comrades

9
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,752
Ratchet, who remains on Earth to
safeguard our human friends,

10
00:01:02,754 --> 00:01:09,775
and Cliffjumper, who made
the ultimate sacrifice.

11
00:01:09,777 --> 00:01:15,881
But on this day, at the dawn of
a new era, we gather to bestow

12
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:19,668
a special honor
one earned by Bumblebee.

13
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,973
Through his bravery and devotion
to the cause of peace,

14
00:01:23,975 --> 00:01:29,927
long before, he rid this universe of
the scourge of the Decepticon warmonger.

15
00:01:33,604 --> 00:01:36,492


16
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:49,167
Megatron.

17
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:51,851
Megatron!

18
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:56,589
Megatron!

19
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01,260
Unicron?

20
00:02:22,194 --> 00:02:26,948
I do not understand.
Why am I not one with the Allspark?

21
00:02:26,983 --> 00:02:29,294
Do I yet live?

22
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:33,548
You do not, yet you cannot
join the Allspark because my

23
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,469
lifeblood once flowed
through your veins.

24
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:41,590
- Dark energon.
- It binds you to my

25
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:44,977
- Anti-spark.
- Optimus Prime used the Matrix

26
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:48,480
of Leadership to imprison
you within the Earth's core.

27
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:51,316
So how is it that you speak to me now?

28
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:55,821
The foolish Prime rendered
only my material form dormant.

29
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:59,808
But my energy form was roused
from slumber when I sensed

30
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,612
the awakening of an ancient
rival across the cosmos.

31
00:03:03,614 --> 00:03:10,194
Primus. so, it would seem that
Optimus succeeded in restoring

32
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:12,938
Cybertron after my demise.

33
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,175
I now wish to finish what I
began eons ago, and for that, my

34
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:20,126
Anti-spark requires a vessel.

35
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:26,601
- So... I will live again?
- Only to serve me.

36
00:03:26,603 --> 00:03:30,505
Your husk will simply be
an instrument of my will.

37
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:35,310


38
00:03:56,312 --> 00:04:01,219
In the company of your fellow
Autobots, in the presence of our

39
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:06,591
creator, Primus, the living
core of our planet, and by the

40
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:10,329
authority vested in me by
the Matrix of Leadership,

41
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:11,530
Bumblebee...

42
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:18,792
-arise a warrior.
- Nice work.

43
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,722
- Warrior, big time!
- You go, B.

44
00:04:20,724 --> 00:04:25,180
Let's get this party started!

45
00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:35,587
Welcome to the club, B.

46
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:39,341
Warrior today, and who knows?
Prime tomorrow?

47
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:42,277
Slow down, Smokey.
I'm not sure I'd wish a Prime's

48
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:47,149
- responsibility on anyone.
- I am sorry to interrupt your celebration.

49
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,036
- Here it comes.
- Primes never party.

50
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:54,539
-but I must take my leave of you.
- Sir, may I ask why?

51
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:58,827
Though Cybertron is once
again able to support life,

52
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:03,732
our planet is currently incapable
of generating new lives

53
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:06,544
Not until I retrieve the
wellspring from which all

54
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:11,623
life on Cybertron is born
and ultimately returns...

55
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:15,710
- The Allspark.
- You mean it isn't here?

56
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:19,447
Nor has it been, Smokescreen...
not for thousands

57
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:23,051
of years. As the war
for Cybertron reached

58
00:05:23,053 --> 00:05:26,638
a tipping point and the
Decepticon army appeared to be

59
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,959
unstoppable, I opted to
safeguard the Allspark from

60
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:36,646
Megatron by covertly sending it
to a distant sector of the galaxy.

61
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:44,689
The Matrix of Leadership will enable
me to guide us to its present location.

62
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:47,242
What are we waiting for?
Let's take the warship

63
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:51,585
- and bring it back.
- These remain dangerous times, Bumblebee.

64
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,853
We cannot leave Cybertron
unsecured

65
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,086
not with Starscream and
Shockwave unaccounted for.

66
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:01,423
Not to mention our stray Predacon.

67
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:05,260
Ultra Magnus, you will
supervise patrols to find and

68
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:08,046
capture the fugitive Decepticons.

69
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:12,134
- I would be honored.
- Bulkhead, you will lead the

70
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:15,303
reconstruction effort.
Begin by building a landing

71
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:18,690
field to welcome returning refugees.

72
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:23,728
Wheeljack, I will require your
extensive experience

73
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,833
- navigating deep space.
- When do we leave?

74
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:40,328
Megatron: Super-luminous
space drive. Impressive.

75
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,465
One of many upgrades that
I've made to your limited

76
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:47,853
corporeal form and wholly
necessary to reach Cybertron.

77
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:52,891
So... we are to rule together, as one?

78
00:06:52,893 --> 00:06:54,799


79
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,280
You will rule nothing!

80
00:06:58,282 --> 00:07:01,483
I travel to Cybertron
for one reason only

81
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:07,989
- to destroy Primus personally.
- But... to destroy Primus...

82
00:07:07,991 --> 00:07:12,077
- is to destroy Cybertron!
- Thus will begin the new

83
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,281
age the age of chaos!

84
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:28,043


85
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:32,631
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
How are you gonna attach the

86
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:37,415
cladding when the framing
structure's incomplete, huh?

87
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:40,555


88
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,135


89
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:59,124
Labor issues?

90
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:01,876
- Any news of our fugitives?
- Just signs of recent

91
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:04,563
scavenging in former
Decepticon installations.

92
00:08:04,565 --> 00:08:07,716
The 'Con warship can't
detect their life signals?

93
00:08:07,718 --> 00:08:10,919
Shockwave must have found a
way to shield or disable them.

94
00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:16,391
I'll feel better when that
gruesome twosome are locked up

95
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:20,720
with the others.

96
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:32,607
Okay, you got my attention.
What do you want?

97
00:08:32,609 --> 00:08:35,327
We're prisoners of war.
We have rights!

98
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:37,829
When are we going to have
access to an oil bath?

99
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:41,616
Well, when are you gonna tell
me where I can find your pals?

100
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:44,169
I told you before,
Shockwave had

101
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:49,507
dozens of secret labs hidden
across Cybertron top-secret.

102
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:55,630
A shame.
Your finish is looking pretty drab.

103
00:08:55,632 --> 00:09:00,335
I don't know where they are, I swear!

104
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:04,072
But I have an idea where
you might try looking.

105
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:08,143
Well, someone may want
to think about renaming

106
00:09:08,145 --> 00:09:11,279
the sea of rust. I'm just sayin'.

107
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:13,898
Though I was hoping more of us
would be rushing back here

108
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,569
to see it you know,
now that it's all bright and shiny.

109
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:19,821
Cybertron will populate in time, kid.

110
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:22,791
You have to remember
refugees could be returning from

111
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:25,043
light-years away.

112
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:28,246
Movement.
Two contacts at .84

113
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:37,169
Approach with caution.

114
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:44,462
My name is Ultra Magnus.
Are you Autobot or Decepticon?

115
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:47,048


116
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,020
Neither.

117
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,985
Predacons!

118
00:09:57,986 --> 00:10:00,932


119
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:53,155
 

120
00:10:56,849 --> 00:10:57,276


121
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,126


122
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,714
Phase beats flame every time!

123
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,248
Scrap!

124
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,987
Bumblebee, I need an
emergency ground bridge, stat!

125
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:44,995


126
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,621


127
00:11:58,623 --> 00:12:01,624
Hang tight, chief. I'm
getting you out of here.

128
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,133


129
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:29,764
Where's the patient?

130
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:32,705
He is suffering from

131
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:37,076
a multitude of internal
injuries, most quite severe.

132
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:39,695
So, anyone care to explain
what two more Predacons are

133
00:12:39,697 --> 00:12:42,264
- doing on Cybertron?
- I thought Optimus said new

134
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:44,850
life wasn't possible
without the Allspark.

135
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:48,385
I'm no authority, but
something tells me cloning old bones

136
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,773
doesn't constitute new life.

137
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:53,509
Shockwave's been playing
in his lab since the war.

138
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,695
- Why stop now?
- Doesn't matter where those

139
00:12:55,697 --> 00:12:59,815
beasts came from.
We got to take 'em down.

140
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:02,201
If Shockwave's back in
business, there could be more of

141
00:13:02,203 --> 00:13:07,323
- them a lot more.
- We need to call Optimus.

142
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:10,076
Really, Bulk? And
interrupt his quest to save

143
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:12,878
the future of our race on Cybertron?

144
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:18,178
Why send the Allspark to Theta-Scorpio,

145
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:22,405
one of the most
hazardous star systems in the galaxy?

146
00:13:22,407 --> 00:13:27,029
Precisely to deter Megatron
from searching this region for it.

147
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:30,847
With all the gamma bursts and
planetoid collisions out here,

148
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:32,982
how can you be sure it survived?

149
00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:36,736
The Allspark itself is
comprised of pure energy.

150
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:41,056
In order to contain it and
launch it off-world, Alpha Trion

151
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:45,444
forged a vessel capable of
extracting it from the ether.

152
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:49,732
it is this indestructible
reliquary we seek.

153
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:52,555
Well, I'll try not to scratch
the paint on this tub,

154
00:13:52,743 --> 00:13:56,022
- but no promises.
- We cannot risk being stranded

155
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:59,759
if our ship is damaged.
It is best that you remain here,

156
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:03,412
- Wheeljack.
- You're the boss.

157
00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:16,809
Watch your step.

158
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:30,105
- Who made him leader?
- He did snuff Megatron.

159
00:14:30,107 --> 00:14:31,457
I'm not leading.

160
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:40,843
- I'm scouting.
- Fair enough.

161
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:43,669
But you do realize we're
nowhere near where we found those

162
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:46,172
- Predacons, right?
- We're not looking for those

163
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:48,808
Predacons. I followed
this energon trail,

164
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,676
which means he was wounded...

165
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:56,599
And I know we aren't
the ones who wounded him.

166
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:59,518
Whoa.
You mean we've been tracking...

167
00:15:01,792 --> 00:15:03,405


168
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:06,642
...Predaking?

169
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,984
Hold fire!

170
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:19,644
Recognize this, Predaking?

171
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,360
You served aboard Megatron's warship.

172
00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:25,630
Surely you're familiar with
this little treasure from

173
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:28,483
his vault the Immobilizer.

174
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:34,756
It causes instant stasis-lock,
though the victim remains fully

175
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:39,677
conscious a living death.

176
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:45,299
But we didn't come here
to fight, your highness.

177
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:52,974
Then why have you
violated my refuge, Autobot?

178
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:57,578
We need answers. Do
you know of any other

179
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,097
Predacons currently on Cybertron?

180
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:06,003
Indeed legions of them.
Behold my subjects

181
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:10,424
a countless multitude, rendered
extinct ages ago by the great

182
00:16:10,426 --> 00:16:13,845
cataclysm, unearthed by the
shifting of plates during our

183
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,914
- planet's restoration.
- Yeah, well, me and

184
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:19,583
Ultra Magnus just about
got scrapped by two living

185
00:16:19,585 --> 00:16:21,936
Predacons.
Know anything about them,

186
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:25,389
- your highness?
- Two? Where?

187
00:16:25,391 --> 00:16:29,026
We came to ask your
help in finding them.

188
00:16:29,028 --> 00:16:32,230
- For revenge?
- No.

189
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:35,066
Optimus Prime would deem it
a tragedy to stain Cybertron's

190
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:37,935
fresh soil with any
newly spilled energon.

191
00:16:37,937 --> 00:16:41,939
So help us prove what Megatron
was never willing to that

192
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:45,560
more than one race can
peacefully coexist on our planet.

193
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:50,490
You assume that because I turned
against Megatron, I can forgive

194
00:16:50,491 --> 00:16:55,386
the Autobots their role in the
destruction of my brethren on Earth?

195
00:16:55,388 --> 00:17:00,441
Leave me be and dare
not trespass here again.

196
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,491
I have returned, partner.
I trust you haven't strained

197
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:38,012
yourself tinkering in your lab
while I was toiling in the field

198
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:42,383
like a common drone?
I mean, I seem to supply old

199
00:17:42,385 --> 00:17:45,937
bones faster than you grow new clones.

200
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,991
Starscream, given our lack of
infrastructure and frequent need

201
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:53,861
to relocate in order to avoid
detection, it is not logical to

202
00:17:53,863 --> 00:17:57,148
expect greater productivity
at this point in time.

203
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,885
At least your new clones
lack the arrogance of your last

204
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:05,706
effort the one who
named himself "Predaking"

205
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:08,459


206
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,377


207
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:13,497
Be careful, you clumsy
brutes! Where have you been?

208
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:16,700
Gutting Autobots.

209
00:18:16,702 --> 00:18:20,054
What?!
You were ordered to avoid all

210
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:22,807
contact with the enemy!

211
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:25,102


212
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:32,049
- I don't hear you laughing now, Darksteel.
- We weren't followed.

213
00:18:32,051 --> 00:18:34,685
Fools! Now that they know of your

214
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:38,072
existence, we have lost
the element of surprise!

215
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:41,492
The Autobots are weak.

216
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:45,947
They fled like cowards.
We have no need to fear them.

217
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:50,901
Perhaps, Skylynx,
but we must not underestimate them, either.

218
00:18:50,903 --> 00:18:55,739
their treacherous scout was able
to fell the mighty Megatron

219
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:59,543
- rest his Spark.
- As such, it is paramount that

220
00:18:59,545 --> 00:19:02,889
we harvest the CNA necessary to
clone more of you

221
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:07,218
- many more of you.
- So that we may build an army

222
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,805
of beasts great enough to
eradicate the Autobots and

223
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:17,979
conquer Cybertron
in Lord Megatron's memory and name.

224
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:24,952
Arcee: What makes you think we'll
find Shockwave's cloning lab here?

225
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:29,573
Yeah, wasn't Darkmount
Megatron's military H.Q.?

226
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:38,332
If the intel I received
from Knockout is accurate...

227
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:40,885
we'll find a map of Shockwave's
entire lab network

228
00:19:40,887 --> 00:19:42,753
in the Citadel's databank.

229
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:51,846


230
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,483
Not good.

231
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:12,333
Optimus, plasma storm incoming!

232
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:19,206
Get out of there! That
Allspark container may be

233
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:24,328
- indestructible, but you aren't!
- I am too close to turn back.

234
00:20:29,007 --> 00:20:31,202


235
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:38,341
"Lord Smokescreen"
emperor of destruction.

236
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:44,117
How can you sit there?
That's some bad mojo.

237
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:46,650
What do you know?
Knockout actually shot

238
00:20:46,652 --> 00:20:49,720
- straight for once.
- What'd you have to do

239
00:20:49,722 --> 00:20:51,789
-  buff his finish?
- Close.

240
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,824
Let's download the data
and get out of here.

241
00:20:53,826 --> 00:20:57,711
Hey. Something's heading our way.

242
00:20:57,713 --> 00:21:01,665
Predaking?

243
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:04,819
- Movin' too fast.
- Starscream?

244
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:35,401
Minions of the Prime,
prepare to be obliterated!

245
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:43,355
- Megatron?
- You skewered bucket-head 

246
00:21:43,357 --> 00:21:46,625
with a giant saber and
managed to miss his Spark?

247
00:21:46,627 --> 00:21:50,519
- How are you still alive?
- And where'd you score the upgrade?

248
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:54,645
Megatron cannot answer
you at this moment,

249
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:58,737
though I can inform you
with utmost authority

250
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:04,126
that he owes his new lease on
life to me Unicron!

251
00:22:04,628 --> 00:22:11,166
And I will not be so easy
to deliver into oblivion.

252
00:22:19,261 --> 00:22:21,165


253
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:48,537
- Bothersome pest.
- That pest is the very one who

254
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:52,290
robbed me of my Spark.
And now I possess the power

255
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:55,410
-  to return the favor!
- You possess nothing!

256
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:59,881
It is I who possess all that
you were and ever will be.

257
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:11,476
- We need to retreat.
- The only way out is down.

258
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:13,929
We can't call for a ground
bridge until we put some space

259
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:16,645
between Unicron and us!

260
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:19,360
Behold my infinite might!

261
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,303
Let's roll.

262
00:23:34,703 --> 00:23:37,547


263
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:38,970


264
00:23:44,749 --> 00:23:48,079


265
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:04,613
Come on, chief.

266
00:24:04,615 --> 00:24:05,880
We're out of time.

267
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:30,672
Whoa! Stop!

268
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:39,981
- A smelting pit?
- Cybertron's been dormant for

269
00:24:39,983 --> 00:24:42,400
thousands of years, but
that's still burning?

270
00:24:42,402 --> 00:24:44,736
Ratchet, we need a ground bridge.

271
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,527


272
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:05,873
Optimus, if we don't get
out of here right now...

273
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:08,876
Optimus!

274
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:19,154
That's why he's Prime.

275
00:25:30,204 --> 00:25:32,667
Cutting it a little
close, don't you think?

276
00:25:32,669 --> 00:25:36,904
Wheeljack, set a course for Cybertron.

277
00:25:36,906 --> 00:25:39,124
Hang on to your hubcaps.

278
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:50,084
That's the future of
life on Cybertron, huh?

279
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:52,854
I kind of figured it'd be bigger.

280
00:25:52,856 --> 00:25:54,973
Hold tight!

281
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:25,119


282
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:34,896


283
00:26:36,982 --> 00:26:38,183


284
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:44,472
No!

285
00:26:54,274 --> 00:26:59,337
Servant of Prime,
you will now join your brethren!

286
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:01,172
You got that right!

287
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:12,928


288
00:27:13,052 --> 00:27:15,657
I... am...
weak!

289
00:27:18,191 --> 00:27:22,710
But our merciless attack drove
the Autobots into submission!

290
00:27:22,712 --> 00:27:24,788
They fled for their very Sparks!

291
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:27,553
A victory over unworthy
opponents, especially

292
00:27:27,554 --> 00:27:30,318
one that did not result in their demise,

293
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,073
is far from an achievement.
Clearly, our improved state is

294
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:38,743
not enough to accomplish the
deed for which I have come.

295
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:45,112
For that, I shall require a much
greater instrument of destruction.

296
00:27:48,094 --> 00:27:51,589
How is this happening?
I mean, we put out a call

297
00:27:51,591 --> 00:27:54,542
inviting refugees back to
Cybertron, and Unicron's

298
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:57,668
- the first in line?
- Not to mention those Predacons.

299
00:27:57,703 --> 00:27:58,880
What have we come home to?

300
00:27:58,882 --> 00:28:01,433
What are we supposed to
call him, huh "Megacron"?

301
00:28:01,517 --> 00:28:03,101
-"Unitron"?
- Really?

302
00:28:03,103 --> 00:28:04,819
That's your biggest issue right now?

303
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:06,738
Right, right. All right, good.

304
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,406
So, what's the game plan?

305
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:17,864
While Unicron may now inhabit
a mortal form, he is still

306
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:22,320
a god and thus cannot be
defeated by customary means.

307
00:28:22,322 --> 00:28:25,290
Optimus?
Wheeljack!

308
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:28,343
This is Bumblebee.
We have an urgent situation.

309
00:28:28,345 --> 00:28:31,501
Bumblebee, this is
Optimus Prime. Proceed.

310
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:35,993
Optimus! Can you hear me?
Come in, please.

311
00:28:35,994 --> 00:28:39,804
- Wheeljack, do you read?
- That hit we took did some damage.

312
00:28:39,806 --> 00:28:43,820
Receiver's operational,
but we can't transmit.

313
00:28:44,778 --> 00:28:48,530
- Nothing.
- You have your voice back.

314
00:28:48,532 --> 00:28:51,866
Now is not the time to go radio-silent.

315
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:55,670
Optimus, in the event that you
can hear us, Unicron has found

316
00:28:55,672 --> 00:28:57,756
his way back to Cybertron.

317
00:28:57,757 --> 00:29:01,557
Repeat the Chaos-bringer is
here, on our soil,

318
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:04,129
in possession of Megatron's body.

319
00:29:04,131 --> 00:29:08,433
Wheeljack, ensure that the
light-speed drive is

320
00:29:08,435 --> 00:29:11,353
- still fully operational.
- So, what now I mean,

321
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:14,556
besides hoping that
Optimus got the message?

322
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:17,275
We figure out why Unicron's here.

323
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:20,145
- And what he wants.
- The big "U" could have taken

324
00:29:20,147 --> 00:29:23,765
Earth behind our backs.
Why come back to Cybertron?

325
00:29:23,767 --> 00:29:27,285
There would be only
one reason, Wheeljack.

326
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:31,873
To destroy the Spark of
his archenemy Primus.

327
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:34,125
But that's the core of our planet!

328
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:36,944
It isn't fair. How
many more times do we have

329
00:29:36,946 --> 00:29:40,448
to save a world have to fight
for the survival of our home?

330
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,470
Regrettably, the
struggle between creation

331
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:47,097
and destruction is an eternal one.

332
00:29:47,098 --> 00:29:51,354
And the battle lines which
separate the two... 

333
00:29:51,477 --> 00:29:57,890
run through the very Spark of
Cybertron. Good and evil.

334
00:29:58,568 --> 00:30:03,905
Order and chaos.
One victorious, one vanquished,

335
00:30:03,907 --> 00:30:08,777
each forming the core of
their own separate worlds

336
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:13,281
Cybertron...
and Earth.

337
00:30:13,283 --> 00:30:18,169
And now..
The darkness has followed us.

338
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:22,538
all the way home.

339
00:30:26,613 --> 00:30:28,129


340
00:30:38,092 --> 00:30:43,561
Hmm. Tracks.
The Autobot spoke the truth.

341
00:30:43,563 --> 00:30:48,830
Other Predacons do exist..
though it seems they took flight here.

342
00:30:48,865 --> 00:30:54,041
Locating my new brethren
will be a futile endeavor,

343
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:57,492
unless I allow them to locate me.

344
00:31:05,624 --> 00:31:07,376
Vitals are improving. 

345
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:11,039
You will be back on your struts
In good time.

346
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,876
Exactly how long is good
time? Because with Optimus

347
00:31:14,877 --> 00:31:18,713
missing in action, we could
really use Ultra Magnus' counsel.

348
00:31:18,715 --> 00:31:22,567
Bumblebee, we have each been
witness to those among us who

349
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:26,571
have risen above their station
time and again rappers,

350
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:31,726
scouts, even field medics.
The Chaos-bringer is at our

351
00:31:31,728 --> 00:31:36,364
doorstep, and now, more than
ever before, we cannot afford

352
00:31:36,366 --> 00:31:39,651
- to wait for salvation.
- We'll launch an attack on

353
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:42,570
Darkmount, provided
Unicron's still there.

354
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:49,761
Or first attempt to locate

355
00:31:49,763 --> 00:31:53,264
him, in the event he is not.

356
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:06,277
The beacon it worked!

357
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:16,621
- Predaking? Alive?
- You know this primitive life-form?

358
00:32:16,623 --> 00:32:20,959
Yes a warrior once under my command,

359
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,296
though I thought he
had perished in battle.

360
00:32:25,298 --> 00:32:29,450
How fortunate that I was
wrong, for Predaking is a loyal

361
00:32:29,452 --> 00:32:32,621
and powerful combatant
who could very well be

362
00:32:32,622 --> 00:32:35,790
the greater instrument of
destruction which you seek.

363
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:42,397
- Megatron?
- Warrior!

364
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,800
I call upon you to serve your master.

365
00:32:45,802 --> 00:32:48,686
In the name of the mighty
legions of Predacons who

366
00:32:48,688 --> 00:32:53,457
preceded me, I shall never
again yield to your charge.

367
00:32:53,944 --> 00:32:58,997
But I will heed your previous advice
and face my true enemy...

368
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:00,198
as a beast!

369
00:33:02,777 --> 00:33:07,488
You dare to deceive me and

370
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:12,627
- have both of us destroyed?
- Perhaps not destroyed 

371
00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:16,514
just damaged enough that our shared
form will no longer be of use to you

372
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:20,668
and force you to abandon
what remains, for regaining my

373
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,939
freewill, even over a mangled
and deficient frame,

374
00:33:24,941 --> 00:33:29,027
is preferable to enduring
a waking life as your slave!

375
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:33,398
For your insolence,
I will only make you endure

376
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,785
greater suffering!

377
00:33:37,787 --> 00:33:39,287


378
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:26,584
Now...
let us learn more of these

379
00:34:26,586 --> 00:34:30,005
mighty legions of which you spoke

380
00:34:30,006 --> 00:34:33,424
by peering directly into your mind.

381
00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:54,278
Ahh. I know now what I require to

382
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,674
tear this world asunder...

383
00:34:57,675 --> 00:35:01,069
and where I might find them.

384
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:11,371
Shockwave.
How was your journey?

385
00:35:11,373 --> 00:35:15,509
Long. Explain why
you have summoned me

386
00:35:15,511 --> 00:35:18,888
to the middle of nowhere.

387
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:22,265
Because I have located our army.

388
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:31,724
The clones sniffed out quite the
mother lode, wouldn't you say?

389
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:39,983
I recommend that we utilize
the warship's operating system 

390
00:35:39,985 --> 00:35:43,204
to search for Megatron's life signal.

391
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:46,289
Doc, that remodel who kicked
our tailpipes he might have

392
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:50,093
looked and sounded like old
bucket-head, but it wasn't him.

393
00:35:50,095 --> 00:35:53,813
That much I know.
But even if a fraction of

394
00:35:53,815 --> 00:35:57,100
Megatron's Spark still flickers
within his body, the ship's

395
00:35:57,102 --> 00:35:59,252
scanners may pick it up.

396
00:36:08,254 --> 00:36:10,864


397
00:36:15,552 --> 00:36:21,250
So, you find me amusing?

398
00:36:24,261 --> 00:36:26,746
Ow. That hurt!

399
00:36:29,518 --> 00:36:32,669
That bone could be
your comrade someday!

400
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:36,289
Now stop fooling around and
return to the task at hand!

401
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:41,144
I do find it curious...
that I am not the only one

402
00:36:41,146 --> 00:36:45,815
currently seeking the
remains of mighty legions.

403
00:36:45,817 --> 00:36:50,570
- It cannot be!
- It defies logic.

404
00:36:50,572 --> 00:36:54,474
Lord Megatron! But
but how?

405
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:58,111
Y-You, uh
oh, what does it matter?

406
00:36:58,113 --> 00:37:01,490
Our master is back and looking

407
00:37:01,491 --> 00:37:04,868
far more imposing than ever!

408
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:09,322
My liege, rest assured, we have
been working tirelessly in your

409
00:37:09,324 --> 00:37:14,142
absence to build an army
powerful enough to conquer Cybertron.

410
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:19,680
I do not wish to conquer this
world. I wish to eradicate it.

411
00:37:20,686 --> 00:37:24,971
Ye... uh
a-apologies, lord Megatron.

412
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:28,911
- I-I can't say that I'm following.
- Silence!

413
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:35,899
Your master is under my control.

414
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:40,620
I am the Destroyer of worlds,
the Bringer of chaos, and

415
00:37:40,622 --> 00:37:45,273
- the Lord of the undead.
- Unicron.

416
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,328
I say we show the Lord
of the undead what it's

417
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,914
like to be unliving!

418
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,382
Rip him to shreds!

419
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:39,579


420
00:38:57,542 --> 00:39:00,700
- Megatron's life signal.
- So, somewhere inside that new

421
00:39:00,702 --> 00:39:04,771
- body armor, he's still alive?
- He's perished and returned before

422
00:39:04,773 --> 00:39:07,957
a phenomenon no doubt
aided by the blood of Unicron,

423
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:10,376
which has coursed through his veins.

424
00:39:10,378 --> 00:39:13,379
The coordinates indicate
he's left Darkmount.

425
00:39:13,381 --> 00:39:15,732
Triangulating his exact position.

426
00:39:18,263 --> 00:39:20,336
We were there earlier today.

427
00:39:20,338 --> 00:39:24,671
- Predaking's refuge?
- Unicron's retracing our steps?

428
00:39:24,706 --> 00:39:29,245
Whoa, wait.
What in Alpha Trion's beard is that?

429
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:38,938
My legion... arise, and purge
this world with your dragon fire!

430
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,356
Terrorcons created from Predacons?

431
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:17,610
- It defies all science.
- We're doomed!

432
00:40:21,612 --> 00:40:23,850


433
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:45,138


434
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,664
Given that we are dealing
with Unicron himself, the energy

435
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:59,769
mass can be only one
thing dark energon.

436
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:03,823
- But for what purpose?
- We all saw it.

437
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:06,559
The valley was filled with
ancient Predacon bones.

438
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:09,078
Unicron's raising an undead army.

439
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,603
One currently traveling
across the hydrax plateau towards...

440
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:16,603
the well of Allsparks, the most

441
00:41:16,605 --> 00:41:19,565
direct route to Cybertron's core...

442
00:41:20,675 --> 00:41:22,108
and Primus.

443
00:41:49,153 --> 00:41:52,085
The past shall consume the future,

444
00:41:52,086 --> 00:41:55,497
the dead shall consume the living,

445
00:41:55,498 --> 00:41:59,862
and chaos shall reign supreme!

446
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:03,249
Unicron clearly seeks to
access our planet's core from 

447
00:42:03,251 --> 00:42:06,586
the same point of entry
that we used to restore it.

448
00:42:06,588 --> 00:42:09,368
No doubt, with every
intention of undoing our efforts.

449
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:10,757
So, what do we do?

450
00:42:10,759 --> 00:42:14,895
We put ourselves between
Unicron's army and the well.

451
00:42:15,797 --> 00:42:18,431
Our strongest assets are this
warship and whatever relics

452
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:20,934
- might be stored in its vault.
- Last time I looked, just the

453
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:22,986
Polarity Gauntlet and the Immobilizer.

454
00:42:22,988 --> 00:42:25,438
Hopefully the genuine
article this time.

455
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,708
I'll round up the secret weapons.

456
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,710
Bulkhead, think you
can pilot this ship?

457
00:42:30,712 --> 00:42:33,947
'Con engineering.
User-friendly, right?

458
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:37,817
Ratchet, you've given your all
to save this world once already.

459
00:42:49,515 --> 00:42:53,958
Where are you taking us?
We have a right to know!

460
00:42:55,503 --> 00:42:58,905
Greetings, fellow Decepticons.

461
00:42:58,907 --> 00:43:02,558
Starscream. Thank the stars!
We can finally escape

462
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,777
- this dreaded ship.
- No, doctor.

463
00:43:04,779 --> 00:43:08,147
We must, in fact, take this ship...

464
00:43:08,149 --> 00:43:10,533
by whatever means necessary.

465
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:20,243
Primary fusion cannons, 
null-rays, ion blasters

466
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:22,028
everything we need to stand
a fighting chance against

467
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:24,914
- Unicron's army.
- B, in case I never get

468
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:27,500
another chance to say this,
you've really proved your mettle.

469
00:43:27,502 --> 00:43:32,472
I'd like to think my actions always
spoke louder than my words, Arcee.

470
00:43:32,474 --> 00:43:35,158
But it didn't hurt to watch
and learn from the best.

471
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,061
It would be nice if
Optimus showed up about now.

472
00:43:38,063 --> 00:43:41,698
I was referring to a powerful little
two-wheeler I know.

473
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,601
Autobots! 
Surrender this warship!

474
00:43:46,603 --> 00:43:49,906


475
00:43:51,908 --> 00:43:55,394
Ah-Ah-Ah.

476
00:43:58,396 --> 00:44:03,036
Funny how the Immobilizer can
freeze bots in their tracks...

477
00:44:03,038 --> 00:44:06,706
- before it's activated.
- And, in case you're

478
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:09,482
wondering, Smokescreen
is in no position to come

479
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:13,279
to your rescue right now.

480
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:14,847
Scrap.

481
00:44:15,849 --> 00:44:17,909


482
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:23,723
- Skylynx, look! One of us!
- Indeed, Darksteel

483
00:44:23,725 --> 00:44:28,644
most likely our predecessor.

484
00:44:31,646 --> 00:44:37,503
The burial ground
desecrated, strip-mined of all

485
00:44:37,505 --> 00:44:40,656
that remained of our ancestors.

486
00:44:40,658 --> 00:44:44,160
You should have been here
to see 'em rise and shine!

487
00:44:44,162 --> 00:44:48,330
- They live?
- If you call being undead "living"

488
00:44:48,365 --> 00:44:53,669
Dark magic perpetrated by the
demon who lives in Megatron's skin.

489
00:44:53,671 --> 00:44:57,557
Just be glad you're alive
so the demon can't

490
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:00,643
-  pull your strings.
- Do you not comprehend the

491
00:45:00,645 --> 00:45:03,830
scope of this tragedy?
We three are proof that our

492
00:45:03,832 --> 00:45:06,899
mighty race might once
again have flourished.

493
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:10,970
Their remains must be reclaimed,
if for no other reason

494
00:45:10,972 --> 00:45:17,443
- than to be properly laid back to rest.
- And who made you boss?

495
00:45:17,445 --> 00:45:21,497
I am not your boss.
I am your King!

496
00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:28,421
Nah, Scream won't use it.
He needs us if he's gonna stand

497
00:45:28,423 --> 00:45:31,657
- any chance of surviving Unicron.
- You misunderstand.

498
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:35,211
I do not intend to use this
warship for battle

499
00:45:35,213 --> 00:45:39,379
but for quickly getting as far as
possible from this doomed planet.

500
00:45:39,414 --> 00:45:41,350
Earth would be nice, now that

501
00:45:41,352 --> 00:45:43,836
Unicron no longer seems
to be calling it home.

502
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:47,640
Shut up, you! Now move
away from the controls,

503
00:45:47,642 --> 00:45:51,644
- Bulkhead, or get stiff!
- There's just one thing you've

504
00:45:51,646 --> 00:45:54,564
overlooked, Scream.
That device you're holding

505
00:45:54,566 --> 00:45:58,234
- not the Immobilizer.
- What?! What do you mean?

506
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:04,657
Aah-ya-yah!

507
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:17,553
I will silence you forever.
Huh?

508
00:46:24,555 --> 00:46:29,015
Now will you believe I'm
joining the winning team?

509
00:46:29,017 --> 00:46:36,031
- Knockout, we needed that!
- Wait. It... really was the Immobilizer?

510
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:45,581
Ha!

511
00:47:11,583 --> 00:47:14,760


512
00:47:18,362 --> 00:47:20,585
All hail..
Predaking.

513
00:47:21,597 --> 00:47:25,757
An impressive display for my creations.

514
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:28,274
But would it not be more logical

515
00:47:28,276 --> 00:47:31,110
to employ your might
elsewhere this time?

516
00:47:35,323 --> 00:47:37,696


517
00:47:43,669 --> 00:47:48,261
Fine!
I hope Unicron destroys you first!

518
00:47:48,263 --> 00:47:52,856
Why'd you do it, Knockout?
Why'd you turn against Starscream?

519
00:47:52,891 --> 00:47:56,220
Even if I had helped him seize
this ship, he would have probably

520
00:47:56,345 --> 00:48:00,083
just fired me out of the first airlock.

521
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:02,575
Oh and he's rude.

522
00:48:05,298 --> 00:48:09,498
- Are we there yet?
- Right on schedule.

523
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,400
And so is Unicron.

524
00:48:30,396 --> 00:48:34,274
- Resistance?
- From my own warship.

525
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:39,104
Demon hordes, take flight...
and eviscerate them!

526
00:48:58,832 --> 00:49:01,436
Maybe Starscream had the right idea.

527
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:02,093


528
00:49:02,095 --> 00:49:05,980
Zombiecon!
Zombiecon!

529
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:13,475
Is it Optimus?

530
00:49:18,106 --> 00:49:20,444
Predaking.

531
00:49:22,178 --> 00:49:26,233
- More flying pests!
- Whom to root for?

532
00:49:26,235 --> 00:49:30,186
The lines have certainly blurred.

533
00:49:30,188 --> 00:49:32,823
Predacon allies.
You called it, B.

534
00:49:32,825 --> 00:49:37,294
And to think Optimus almost
passed down the Matrix to me.

535
00:49:37,296 --> 00:49:40,163
- Whoa. What?!
- Yeah, I said it.

536
00:49:40,165 --> 00:49:43,083
But "right place, right time"
doesn't mean "right bot"

537
00:49:43,085 --> 00:49:44,367
I know that now.

538
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:07,056
 

539
00:50:07,058 --> 00:50:08,075
Brace for impact!

540
00:50:31,077 --> 00:50:34,417

Whew!

541
00:50:34,419 --> 00:50:36,803
Nothing a little
carnauba wax won't fix up.

542
00:50:36,805 --> 00:50:38,722


543
00:50:38,724 --> 00:50:43,760
Ugh.

544
00:50:43,762 --> 00:50:45,562


545
00:50:45,564 --> 00:50:46,429
Huh?

546
00:50:57,431 --> 00:50:59,960


547
00:51:13,742 --> 00:51:17,093
My legion, the time is upon us.

548
00:51:17,095 --> 00:51:20,814
Destroy Primus with your dragon fire!

549
00:51:31,938 --> 00:51:36,495
- We're the last line of defense.
- I would recommend leaving that

550
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:40,817
to those more suited for the task.
Skylynx! Darksteel!

551
00:51:40,819 --> 00:51:43,119
Allow nothing to enter the well.

552
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:33,696
Really?
This is how it ends? 

553
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,806
We're not losing our planet

554
00:52:35,807 --> 00:52:38,517
not without taking Unicron with it.

555
00:52:39,067 --> 00:52:43,832
What?
A familiar resonance

556
00:52:43,833 --> 00:52:46,897
pure energy, not unlike Primus...

557
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:51,492
one I have not encountered
since ancient days.

558
00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:53,727
The Allspark!

559
00:52:58,802 --> 00:53:01,785
- Optimus.
- I never thought I'd be so

560
00:53:01,787 --> 00:53:03,638
happy to see that big rig!

561
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:07,041
We must keep the Allspark
from Unicron's reach.

562
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:09,876
I thought the container
was indestructible.

563
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:14,883
Indeed. But if this
vessel once trapped the Allspark,

564
00:53:14,884 --> 00:53:18,102
I fear that it can
also be emptied of it.

565
00:53:20,741 --> 00:53:23,173
So, the Prime returns!

566
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:29,806
Ugh!

567
00:53:30,837 --> 00:53:32,166
Ugh!

568
00:53:36,104 --> 00:53:37,980
Jacky!

569
00:53:44,591 --> 00:53:49,416
Thank you, Prime
for delivering the Allspark so that

570
00:53:49,418 --> 00:53:55,806
- I may erase it from existence.
- Not while I stand before you, Unicron.

571
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:09,403
Megatron, you and I once united
to save a world from Unicron.

572
00:54:09,405 --> 00:54:14,992
- We must do so again.
- Megatron may hear you,

573
00:54:14,994 --> 00:54:18,445
but he cannot help you..

574
00:54:18,447 --> 00:54:22,283
for he is enduring eternal suffering.

575
00:54:25,842 --> 00:54:30,124
Your efforts to protect
Cybertron's most sacred relic

576
00:54:30,126 --> 00:54:35,481
are futile! My legion is
within reach of Primus

577
00:54:35,516 --> 00:54:38,551
your planet's very core.

578
00:54:38,586 --> 00:54:43,220
And we both know that the
Allspark cannot thrive

579
00:54:43,222 --> 00:54:49,381
in a poisoned well.

580
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:54,315
Downside to wearing metal
near a Polarity Gauntlet...

581
00:54:54,317 --> 00:54:56,867
You're subject to
the laws of magnetism.

582
00:54:56,869 --> 00:55:00,991
Optimus, go!
Save the Allspark!

583
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:10,214
I've been worse.

584
00:55:13,177 --> 00:55:18,722
So, how are we gonna
get that thing to safety?

585
00:55:18,724 --> 00:55:21,686
By the only means available to us

586
00:55:21,723 --> 00:55:25,221
under these most dire of circumstances.

587
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:28,791
The very survival of
our species upon this

588
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:32,786
or any world depends upon it.

589
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:35,239


590
00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:01,849


591
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:10,117
I shall devour your Allspark whole!

592
00:56:12,812 --> 00:56:15,760
What?! A trick?!

593
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,119


594
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:57,965


595
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,826
As a being comprised of
pure energy, 

596
00:57:00,827 --> 00:57:06,531
Unicron's Antispark was vulnerable
to this reliquary of the Primes.

597
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:10,334
- But if he's in there, where's
- Praise the Allspark!

598
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:17,591
- Master! You're alive!
- Indeed.

599
00:57:17,593 --> 00:57:20,410
Your new battle armor will
take things to the next level,

600
00:57:20,412 --> 00:57:23,013
My liege.
Together we will reunite all

601
00:57:23,015 --> 00:57:27,434
Decepticons and once again
grind Cybertron under 

602
00:57:27,436 --> 00:57:29,219
- your mighty heel!
- No!

603
00:57:29,221 --> 00:57:31,719
What? Why?

604
00:57:37,852 --> 00:57:41,930
Because I now know the true
meaning of oppression...

605
00:57:42,675 --> 00:57:46,862
and have thus lost my
taste for inflicting it.

606
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:48,956


607
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:51,608
Uh, you've clearly been
traumatized, master.

608
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:55,029
A good power-down and a
stroll around the smelting

609
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:58,448
pit will put you back in
touch with your inner warlord.

610
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:04,555
Enough! The Decepticons are
no more, and that is final.

611
00:58:09,557 --> 00:58:14,464
Yes.
Well, we all have plenty to

612
00:58:14,466 --> 00:58:16,550
think about, don't we?

613
00:58:28,629 --> 00:58:31,999
This is not quite how
I envisioned my rise to the throne, 

614
00:58:32,001 --> 00:58:36,286
but since lord Megatron
all but surrendered it to me,

615
00:58:36,288 --> 00:58:40,156
I will gladly revive the
Decepticons in my name.

616
00:58:40,158 --> 00:58:44,478


617
00:58:45,297 --> 00:58:46,981


618
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,665


619
00:58:50,823 --> 00:58:54,521
Though perhaps a throne is more

620
00:58:54,523 --> 00:58:56,857
befitting of an actual King.

621
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:05,315
I am not here to seize
thrones, Starscream..

622
00:59:05,317 --> 00:59:08,518
but to settle scores.

623
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,703


624
00:59:16,705 --> 00:59:22,299
In order to both protect the
Allspark and secure Unicron's

625
00:59:22,301 --> 00:59:27,537
defeat, it was necessary for me
to empty the vessel's contents.

626
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:32,609
- Into where?
- The Matrix of Leadership.

627
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:37,247
As such, my own Spark can no
longer be separated from

628
00:59:37,249 --> 00:59:42,352
- the multitude of others within me.
- Are you telling us...

629
00:59:42,354 --> 00:59:45,522
that you are now..
one with the Allspark?

630
00:59:45,524 --> 00:59:49,686
That's what you
say when someone kicks the.

631
00:59:50,857 --> 00:59:54,337
To not return the Allspark to the well

632
00:59:54,372 --> 00:59:57,034
would be to prevent future
generations of new life

633
00:59:57,036 --> 01:00:00,388
from existing on Cybertron.

634
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:03,740
My quest must be completed.

635
01:00:03,742 --> 01:00:09,179
Optimus, I didn't return to
save a life only to lose

636
01:00:09,181 --> 01:00:11,057
the one I care most about.

637
01:00:11,058 --> 01:00:14,427
Ratchet's restored planets.
he'll find a way to save you!

638
01:00:14,428 --> 01:00:17,697
We can turn to Vector Sigma,
just like we did before.

639
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:22,456
Because the Matrix must now
be relinquished with the Allspark,

640
01:00:22,457 --> 01:00:26,864
it cannot be restored
or passed down to another.

641
01:00:26,865 --> 01:00:32,736
But while this may very well
mark the end of the age of Primes,

642
01:00:32,737 --> 01:00:37,534
leadership can be earned
with or without the Matrix,

643
01:00:37,535 --> 01:00:42,390
and, in my view..
you have each acted as a Prime.

644
01:00:43,702 --> 01:00:47,335
Well, I... never really had
the best role models.

645
01:00:47,336 --> 01:00:50,888
As even Megatron has
demonstrated on this day,

646
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:56,607
every sentient being possesses
the capacity for change.

647
01:00:57,681 --> 01:01:01,131
I ask only this of you, fellow Autobots

648
01:01:02,357 --> 01:01:06,353
keep fighting the noblest of fights.

649
01:01:06,355 --> 01:01:09,472
You can count on us to keep the peace.

650
01:01:12,276 --> 01:01:15,353


651
01:01:39,474 --> 01:01:43,690
Above all,
do not lament my absence..

652
01:01:49,692 --> 01:01:55,068
for in my Spark,
I know that this is not the end..

653
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:10,884
but merely a new beginning..

654
01:02:13,982 --> 01:02:18,642
simply put, another transformation.
