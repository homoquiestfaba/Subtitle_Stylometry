Nugi's funeral was unusual.

3
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,500
Many people attended the wake,

4
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,233
but his personal crew
did the burial secretly.

5
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:45,650
Since Bazil, Hamid, Joshu,
and I grew up with Nugi,

6
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:49,838
we wanted to be present till the end.

7
00:00:49,838 --> 00:00:52,838
(somber music)

8
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:33,123
- I'm really gonna miss you, Nugi.

9
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:36,570
- Unfortunately, Nugi wasn't alive.

10
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,520
The dollars come quick, but
the death rate is just so high.

11
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:42,936
- [Shoemie Voiceover] Nugi's personal crew

12
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,860
vanished from the scene.

13
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,080
Never to be seen again.

14
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,787
- I remember when we was youngsters

15
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:51,873
and those food stamps came out his pocket.

16
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,990
After that, he always said

17
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,903
he's gonna be the man with all the money.

18
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,823
- [Shoemie Voiceover] I was barely a teen

19
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:12,090
without a worry in the world.

20
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,240
The homies would always hang on Saturdays

21
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,340
for neighborhood ball.

22
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:19,840
- Shoemie, you ain't about
to get no more touchdowns.

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,230
Matter of fact, you ain't
even got to get the pass off.

24
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,183
- Yeah, all right then.

25
00:02:24,183 --> 00:02:25,662
We'll see about all that.

26
00:02:25,662 --> 00:02:28,579
This is for game, this is for game.

27
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:31,110
- What's that supposed to mean?

28
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,837
Now you definitely ain't scoring, Nugi.

29
00:02:32,837 --> 00:02:34,296
- Hamid, don't even worry about it, foo'.

30
00:02:34,296 --> 00:02:36,160
- That's tellin' 'em, Joshu.

31

- Yeah, let's do this.

36
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,590
Hey Bazil, this is for
you, this is for you.

37
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,923
- Let's do this.

38

Ready, set, go!

39

- Hey don't worry, boy,

42
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:16,922

Nugi's main squeeze,
Deneena, in the middle.

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,473
As years went on, we all grew differently.

48
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,190
Nugi was at another level.

49
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,950
Nugi was big time now. He
ran a small strip joint.

50
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,353
It was his cover-up for the dope game

51
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:58,873
that he was involved in.

52
00:04:08,135 --> 00:04:10,590

with white in this town,

53
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,580

They were the hit men of the
city and they were the best.

71
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,493
When it came down to
guns, he was a supplier.

72
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,500
Bobo and Nugi were real close,

73

they spent youth time together in CYA,

which is a jail facility
in Northern California.

75

Bobo was also from Oakland, the east side.

76
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,930
That's why him and Nugi were so close.

77

Common territory.

(gunshot firing)

your punk ass down, nigga.

180
00:09:09,184 --> 00:09:10,101
Don't move.

181

You want big time?

187
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,750
Well Bobo will show you
what big time really is.

188
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,306
Street game?

189
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:43,510
You can't teach it.

190
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,120
You have to live it, then talk about it.

191
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:51,562
(gunshots firing)

192
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,487

Nigga, where you going, fool?

Get the car, get the car!

203
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:52,401

204
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,234

00:10:53,234 --> 00:10:56,122

- Killer, you gonna kill me, man?

209
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:07,737
Don't kill me, man.

210
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:09,046
- Get in there!
- Freddy, don't!

211
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:10,164
- Do what he says!

212
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:13,535
(men chattering)

213
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:18,466
- Yeah, yeah.
(men chattering)

214
00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:22,520

Take them in.

216
00:11:23,472 --> 00:11:25,305
Take them to the spot.

217
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:35,893
- Get out!

218
00:11:35,893 --> 00:11:36,726
Get out!

00:11:39,964 --> 00:11:41,382
Get out!
- Get out.

222
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:43,226
- Step back there, punk!

223
00:11:43,226 --> 00:11:44,509

224
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:45,462
You getting nothing.

- [Radio DJ] I'm Debonair.

229
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:31,329
Good morning Oakland and Bay area.

230
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:32,470
Got something new for you.

231
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,057
You're tuned into KMOB 90.7.

232
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,260
It's 15 minutes after the hour of 7:00 AM,

233
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,854
and now back to more K-Mob music.

234
00:12:40,854 --> 00:12:43,521
(intense music)

235
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,718
- Mm, what up, Oak town?

236
00:12:54,718 --> 00:12:57,799
Man, it feels good to be
turning back to my roots.

237
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,785
Thought I'd never make
it back to this place.

238
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:02,535
(rhythmic music)

239
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,590
- [Announcer] Good morning, from KDEB TV3.

240
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,333
This is the award winning
AM Oakland morning news.

241
00:13:27,343 --> 00:13:30,273
- [Sherri] Good morning,
I'm Sherri Gonzales.

242
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:31,646
Oakland Police investigators

243
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:34,186
are still searching
for at least two gunmen

244
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:36,220
who's sprayed an East Oakland house

245
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,593
with bullets just before
dawn this morning.

246
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,720
The home is on Birch
Street near 82nd avenue.

247
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,570
Oakland Police would not
release the name of the owners,

248
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,853
but they just say he is
a suspected drug dealer.

249
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,415
Witnesses say that they heard
a car screech to a hault

250
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,350
outside the home this morning.

251
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,063
- What the hell has happened to Oakland?

252
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,840
- [Shoemie Voiceover] My father
taught me how to be a man.

253
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,880
That's why it's been 11
years since I've been home.

254
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,053
The death of my mother
reunited my father and me.

255
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:09,627
I didn't want to lose him
without letting him know

256
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:11,920
how much I admire him,

257
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,050
because it's not about
reaching out over the phone,

258
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,203
rather than one's physical presence.

259
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,917
- Woo, it's a jungle out there.

260
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,010
I know better than that.

261
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,823
Oakland can be a positive city.

262
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,670
- Hey, what's up, Pop?
- Hey!

263
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,036
Boy, you still got your key, huh?

264
00:14:49,036 --> 00:14:49,988
- Aw man.

265
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:51,150
It's good to see you, man.

266
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,850
- Look at you, boy, you look good.

267
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,693
- Yeah.

268
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:55,953
- You done put a little
weight there too, huh?

269
00:14:55,953 --> 00:14:56,786
- You know it.

270
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:58,230
You ain't looking bad yourself.

271
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,647
Man, you sure you're sick?

272
00:14:59,647 --> 00:15:01,900
Or is that just your way of
getting me to come back home?

273
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,570
- Well, I wish my heart
wouldn't bother me.

274
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,250
It got so bad I had to retire

275
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,350
from the construction business.

276
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,543
It was just too stressful.

277
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,930
Oh boy, I wish your mother
was here to see you, boy.

278
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,513
She would be so proud of you.

279
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:14,790
- Yeah, I know, Pop.

280
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,460
Well yo, mom is in my heart,

281
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,760
and she will always be with me in spirit.

282
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,570
- Yeah, you right son.

283
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,614
Hey, let's help unpack your book bag

284
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:23,713
and get you settled in, boy.
- Sounds good.

285
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:24,668
That sounds good.

286
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:27,748
- I got up thousand things
to update you on, boy.

287
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:28,581
- Oh yeah?

288
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:29,750
- Oakland done changed a lot

289
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,090
since you been up there in Washington.

290
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:35,470
And the employment situation
around here stinks.

291
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,890
Boy, be glad you had a boss

292
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,630
who could hook you up
with a job the way he did.

293
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,847
- Yeah?

294
00:15:39,847 --> 00:15:40,890
- Must pay pretty decent too, huh?

295
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,274
- We you know the superviser.

296
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,253
He the one that got me the job.

297
00:15:43,253 --> 00:15:44,206
- Yeah.

298
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:45,300
- He's a pretty cool white guy.

299
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,530
- All white people ain't evil, son.

300
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,279
Just a few of them.

301
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,247
- I know, I know.

302
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:51,540
- Hey, a couple of your buddies

303
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,580
always stopping by here to visit with me

304
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,530
since you've been gone.

305
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,710
- Who's that, Pops?

306
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,547
- Oh, that boy on crutches.

307
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:58,260
What's that boy name?

308
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,093
Joshua!

309
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:00,357

And also your other friend, Habit, Hamid.

312
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:07,403
- Hamid, Hamid, yeah.
- Hamid, yeah.

313
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:10,290
Did you know that boy
with the police force now?

314
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,060
- Wait a minute, Hamid's a cop?

315
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,175
- Yeah.

316
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:14,992
- What about Nugi?

317
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:17,490
- Eh, I don't know about that boy, son.

318
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,900
I think he's into drugs.

319
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,130
- Oh no.

320
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,083
- Well you watch yourself around him.

321
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,913
He's what I call a, a consequence.

322
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,581
You are hard working young
man with a good mind.

323
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:29,630
You can go places, son.

324
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,463
Think so, Pop?

325
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,060
- Yeah!
- Thanks, man.

326
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,073
- Say, what happened to that
old girl you been having?

327
00:16:34,073 --> 00:16:35,692
- Hey.

328
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:37,810
Hate to say it, but we broke up, man.

329
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:38,643
- Oh, well.

330
00:16:39,735 --> 00:16:41,093
Life rolls on.

00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:42,783
(men laughing)

332
00:16:42,783 --> 00:16:45,310
My boy, come here, boy.

00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:07,944
(serene music)

336

- [Shoemie Voiceover]
Man, she was gorgeous.

337
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:23,367
And she smiled at me, it's on now.

338
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,285

339
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,312

00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:00,138
- What are you doing here?

342
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:01,392
You picking up food for tonight?

343
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:02,426
- Yeah, didn't I tell you last night

344
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:03,610
I was gonna pick up
something for the kids?

345
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,733
- Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.

346
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,114
I'll see you in a couple hours.

347
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:06,947
- Okay, I'll see you.

348
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:16,471
- Pork isn't good for you.

349
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:19,817
- Were you talking to me?

350
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:22,678
Excuse me, miss.
- That new man, huh?

351
00:18:22,678 --> 00:18:24,036
- Were you talking to me back there?

352
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:24,989

00:18:24,989 --> 00:18:25,849
Hi, I'm Imani, what's your name?

00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:29,596
I'm surprised a gorgeous
young lady like yourself

357
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:31,360
would take interest in what I'm eating.

358
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,193
Pretty nice of you.

359
00:18:32,193 --> 00:18:33,026
Do you stay around here?

360
00:18:33,026 --> 00:18:33,859
- You need a sack?
- No man, I'm cool.

361
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:35,269
- Actually, I go to school around here.

362
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:37,478
I'm a full time student at the University.

363
00:18:37,478 --> 00:18:38,429
- That's good.

364
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:40,351
I graduated from University
of Washington four years ago

365
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:42,076
and I have a degree in sociology.

366
00:18:42,076 --> 00:18:43,660
- Well this fall's gonna be my last year.

367
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,727
- Is it?
- Yeah, I can't wait.

368
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:47,557
It's good to run into a
brother who's educated.

369
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:48,510
- Is that right?

370
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,223
- So, are you on your way home to.

371
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:53,390
- [Shoemie Voiceover] Imani
had nice conversation,

372
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,223
and she was gorgeous.

373
00:18:54,223 --> 00:18:55,839
- Excuse me ma'am, that's five dollars.

374
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,971
- [Shoemie Voiceover]
In the back of my mind,

375
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:58,663
I felt her attracted to me.

376
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:02,730
- Well um, I gotta go.

377
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:06,028
Myself, I'm on my way
to a meeting right now.

378
00:19:06,028 --> 00:19:07,383
It's really nice talking to you.

379
00:19:07,383 --> 00:19:08,400
- All right, you take care now.

380
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,040
- Have a nice day.
- Drive safe.

381
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,310
- Thank you.

382
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,463
What's up, man?
- How's it going, man?

383
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,732
- You know, I respect a man
who can take care of himself.

384
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:33,412
- Well, you know, Imani,

385
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:34,810
you're more than welcome
to come over for dinner.

386
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,730
I'm a pretty fair cook.

387
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,140
- Sounds tempting, but I can't tonight.

388
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,436
I'll tell you what, though.

389
00:19:40,436 --> 00:19:41,269
I'll give you my phone number,

390
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:42,940
maybe we can get together sometime.

391
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,131
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

392
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:45,810
You mean you don't have a boyfriend?

393
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,560
- Well, I broke up with
my ex about a year ago.

394
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,540
So I consider myself available.

395
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,814
- Okay.
- I'm not into games, though.

396
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:53,580
But you seem as serious as you are nice.

397
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,883
So, why don't you call me
when you have some free time?

398
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,049
I gotta get going now.

399
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:00,002
I'm late for a meeting.

400
00:20:00,002 --> 00:20:01,018
- Well Imani, you to take it easy

401
00:20:01,018 --> 00:20:03,518
and I'll see you around, okay?

402
00:20:23,084 --> 00:20:24,020
- [Shoemie Voiceover]
Haven't seen my homies

403
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,720
from the old hood since I went away

404
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,670
to the University of Washington
on an athletic scholarship.

405
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,320
So I was more than curious to
see what they all were up to,

406
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,370
because time definitely brings on change.

407
00:20:38,151 --> 00:20:41,005
Joshu and I had a common bond between us.

408
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:44,850
We both lost one parent and
understood each other's pain.

409
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,838
We shared empathy for one another.

410
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:47,791
- All right, man.

411
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,139
- Man, what's going on, man?

412
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:50,161
- Oh man, good.
- I'm cool.

413
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:51,663
- Good to see you, man.

414
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:53,757
- Come on, now.
- Yeah, surprise though.

415
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:54,709
- Yeah.

416
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:55,662
- What's up, man?

417
00:20:55,662 --> 00:20:56,615
You over here starting your business.

418
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:58,114
- Oh man, still trying
to get settled in, man.

419
00:20:58,114 --> 00:21:00,096
You know, it's kinda harsh
starting out from scratch.

420
00:21:00,096 --> 00:21:02,762
All I have right now is my furniture, man.

421
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,714
- Oh shit, man.

422
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:04,687
You know how it is.

423
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:06,507
Making it good just takes
a little time, that's all.

424
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:07,764
- I guess you right, man.

425
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:09,912
So, what's up, man?

426
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:11,861
Are you gonna say I never seen ya.

427
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:14,111
- I ain't say nothing, man.

428
00:21:17,742 --> 00:21:18,575
- We're tight, man.

429
00:21:18,575 --> 00:21:20,350
- You know Joshu always did respect

430
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,040
your vision and your vibe, man.

431
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,210
Someday you're gonna become,

432
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,216
you're gonna win an American Music Award.

433
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:26,407
- Oh yeah, you know that?

434
00:21:26,407 --> 00:21:28,945
- But tell me something,
Joshu, you ever get frustrated?

435
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:30,850
- And you know I do, man.
- Yeah.

436
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,241
- Sometimes get upset, you know,

437
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:35,268
my nigga I fall with the most,
you know what I'm saying?

438
00:21:35,268 --> 00:21:37,960
The car wreck done
really fucked me up, man.

439
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,860
It still does.
- Yeah.

440
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,860
- But you know what?

441
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,190
That music is like my father.

442
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,631
God and his trials, you
know what I'm saying?

443
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:45,581
- Uh-huh.

444
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:47,288
- So how's your pop doing, man?

445
00:21:47,288 --> 00:21:48,839
- Well you know, Pops is
getting on my case man,

446
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,250
about being better himself.

447
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,310
And telling me I should
be making my mom proud.

448
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,910
Speaking of which, I met
this lovely lady today, man.

449
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,620
- I feel you something, man.

450
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,380
I always go the death of our parents,

451
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,856
that's what always kept us strong,

452
00:21:59,856 --> 00:22:00,740
you know what I'm saying?
- Right.

453
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,640
- So when's the last time
you ever seen your boy, Nugi?

454
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,121
- Aw man, I haven't seen
Nugi in a while, man.

455
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:06,078
How about you?

456
00:22:06,078 --> 00:22:07,031
Have you seen him lately?

457
00:22:07,031 --> 00:22:09,460
- It's been a while, man.

458
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,210
I hear he's the man, man.

459
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,170
You know what I'm saying?

460
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,450
- That's too bad.

461
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,520
- I always thought,

462
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,560
what'd it'd be like for the boys

463
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,270
to get back together again, you know?

464
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,013
- Yeah, just like the good old times.

465
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:19,965
- Yeah, old times sake.

466
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:23,081
'Cause who'd ever thought
that Hamid would become a cop?

467
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:24,440
- Yeah, that's the last thing.

468
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,460
- Bazil a construction worker.

469
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,913
Nugi, the deed man.
- Damn.

470
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,430
- Myself, a struggling ass producer.

471
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,333
- Naw man.

472
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,550
- And you Shoemie, psychologist.

473
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,633
Healer of all minds.

474
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,560
- I don't know about all that man.

475
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,360
Man, thanks for the promotion,

476
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,703
but I'm far from being
a psychologist, man.

477
00:22:41,703 --> 00:22:42,536
- I don't think so, man.

478
00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:46,311
You're the only person that I
know that helps and listens.

479
00:22:46,311 --> 00:22:48,967
Most people just talk,
you know what I'm saying?

480
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,630
You also played a mean game of football

481
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,884
back in the day, too.
- I did.

482
00:22:53,884 --> 00:22:56,386
But let me give you a
few compliments, man.

483
00:22:56,386 --> 00:22:57,337
- Go on.

484
00:22:57,337 --> 00:22:58,170
- You know, just before
your accident, man,

485
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,600
you was one hell of a
football player yourself.

486
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,225
But tell you what man, you
one hell of a producer.

487
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:05,480
This music of yours' kicking.
- It's delirious, right?

488
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,240
You know, when I was in high school, man,

489
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,790
I was on this damn cane.

490
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,020
So I'm a take a bow, you
know what I'm saying?

491
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,404
- [Shoemie] Right, I understand that.

492
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:13,510
- Oh, lit.

493
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,920
You know, you are definitely lucky.

494
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,452
If I was a man like you.

495
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:18,673
(knocking on door)

496
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:20,756
- Joshu, what's up, man?

497
00:23:20,756 --> 00:23:22,134
We going or what, man?

498
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,226
You know what I'm saying, man.

499
00:23:23,226 --> 00:23:24,059
Hey, I know you, man.

500
00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:25,289
- [Shoemie] Hey, what's going on, man.

501
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:26,242
How you doing?

502
00:23:26,242 --> 00:23:27,194
- Yeah.

503
00:23:27,194 --> 00:23:28,734
You with the University of Washington.

504
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:29,687
- Right, I did.

505
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:30,683
- Yeah, you's a slot back.

506
00:23:30,683 --> 00:23:31,516
I saw you in the Rose Bowl.
- Uh-huh.

507
00:23:31,516 --> 00:23:32,896
- Yeah, you was raw.

508
00:23:32,896 --> 00:23:34,140
Aye, aye didn't you go pro?

509
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,328
- I did.

510
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:37,415
I played up at, I played
up in Canada for two years.

511
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:38,388
- You did?
- With the Eskimos.

512
00:23:38,388 --> 00:23:39,871
So, you know, now that's it.
- That's good, man.

513
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:40,864
You was raw, man.

514
00:23:40,864 --> 00:23:41,697
I remember you.

515
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:42,680
- Now this year,

516
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,500
I think that we should really get involved

517
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,707
and do something positive
in the community.

518
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:49,341
You know, something
that has a real impact.

519
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:51,460
You know, something positive.

520
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,223
Does anybody have any suggestions?

521
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,420
- What about something dealing
with high school students?

522
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,770
- Okay, good idea.

523
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,230
- What about a learning
center for African history.

524
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:11,885
- Good idea.

525
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:17,882
What else?

526
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:20,450
- Hey Ash, well what about the homeless?

527
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,390
- [Shoemie] Imani Epsilon Phi Psi Sorority

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,981
The ladies represented
community involvement

530
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:31,163
and positive leadership among black women.

531
00:24:34,066 --> 00:24:35,018
- Come on ladies.

532
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:36,730
We're gonna go by a process
of elimination here.

533
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,750
So we need to get as many
ideas up on the board

534
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,943
as we possibly can.

535
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,103
We need to get as many ideas
up here on the board as we can

536
00:24:45,103 --> 00:24:47,510
so that we can eliminate
them down to just one

537
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,350
that we can all agree upon.

538
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,310
And if we don't get
participation from everybody,

539
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,700
then we're just gonna have
to go with what we have.

540
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,793
It seems as if only the senior
sorors are participating.

541
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:00,164
- She's cute when she's demanding.

542
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:00,997
- I see.

543
00:25:00,997 --> 00:25:03,747
(women laughing)

544
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:10,030
- Well what about afterschool programs?

545
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,863
- Good idea.

546
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,473
Good.

547
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:20,400
- You know, I really like
that suggestion Val made.

548
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,530
Being from Oakland myself,

549
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,780
I think we should do something
like an afterschool program.

550
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,340
In fact, I got a little brother

551
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,560
who's involved with the East
Oakland Boys and Girls club,

552
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,880
and he was telling me that
his basketball program

553
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,920
is about to be cut.

554
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,300
Uh-huh, because there's not enough money.

555
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,170
If programs like this get cut,

556
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,690
then the kids involved
have no alternatives,

557
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,921
which I believe in itself
would lead to drugs and crime.

558
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:45,874
- That's true.
- That's true.

559
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:46,707
- You know, that's true.

560
00:25:46,707 --> 00:25:47,540
I can really relate to that.

561
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,960
- You know, actually I think
that's a really good idea.

562
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,360
I say that we can take a
vote on that right now.

563
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,250
Good, so it's confirmed.

564
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,813
Afterschool programs it is.

565
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,570
- Hey Bella, won't you go give me

566
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,170
something to drink, all right?

567
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,734
- Okay, be right back.
- Excuse yourself.

568
00:26:04,734 --> 00:26:05,567
- Come here, doll.

569
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:06,400
Speak.

570
00:26:07,935 --> 00:26:09,353
Yeah, you like that, don't you?

571
00:26:09,353 --> 00:26:11,950
Give me a little sugar, say bout that.

572
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,110
- How you ladies enjoying the party?

573
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,830
- Oh, we're enjoying it.

574
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,090
- That's good, that's good.

575
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:16,970
Check this out,

576
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,446
I got some VSOP in the
house if you ladies down.

577
00:26:19,446 --> 00:26:20,870
- Sounds good to me.
- Good to me.

578
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,330
- That's good, after you.

579
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:27,232
All right.

580
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,344
- Bobo, hey Bobo, how you doing?

581
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,317
- Hey, what's up Gigi?

582
00:26:36,317 --> 00:26:37,450
What's this about?

583
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,190
What's going on, huh?

584
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,020
Check this out, I want y'all
to come strip from my brother.

585
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:44,043
He supposed to come home
up out the penitentiary.

586
00:26:44,043 --> 00:26:44,994
- Okay.

587
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:45,931
- And I want y'all to come strip.

588
00:26:45,931 --> 00:26:47,714

589
00:26:47,714 --> 00:26:48,844
- Okay, you down?

00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,233

597
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:08,708

598
00:27:09,716 --> 00:27:10,549

599
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:11,390

600
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:13,418
- My man right here.

601
00:27:13,418 --> 00:27:14,370
- Oh yeah?

602
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,203
It's Antonio Feliz.

603
00:27:15,203 --> 00:27:16,196
- How you doing, dude?

604
00:27:16,196 --> 00:27:17,900
Yeah, I seen you nice and comfortable

605
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,620
in my favorite chair a little while ago.

606
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,453
- Well, it's the best.

607
00:27:20,453 --> 00:27:21,462
- Who's that you got with you there?

608
00:27:21,462 --> 00:27:22,550
- Ah, this is.
- Lucy.

609
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,383
- Lucy?

610
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:24,216
How you doing, Lucy?

611
00:27:24,216 --> 00:27:25,049
You look good.

612
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:25,882
What's up, G?

613
00:27:25,882 --> 00:27:27,753
- Yeah, we talked about, man, we got,

614
00:27:27,753 --> 00:27:31,035
he gonna give us 10 G's
long as he gets 50 down.

615
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:31,950
- 50?

616
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,870
Can you guarantee me that same processing

617
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,009
and packaging as always?

618
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:36,840
- Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

619
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,785
- That sounds tight.

620
00:27:37,785 --> 00:27:39,103
It's your world, man.

621
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:40,530
All right.

622
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,657
Okay.

623
00:27:41,657 --> 00:27:43,860
- Well, goodnight baby.

624
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,693
Ready when you are.

625
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:45,892
- Okay man.

626
00:27:45,892 --> 00:27:46,844
Go get yourself a dream, man.

627
00:27:46,844 --> 00:27:47,930
- All right.
- It's all good.

628
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:48,763
- All right.

629
00:27:52,055 --> 00:27:53,390
- Say dude, hey man.

630
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,520
You think we can trust
these motherfuckers?

631
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,700
I trust your judgment man,

632
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,810
but I don't like white people, man.

633
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,578
- I did my homework, man.

634
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,530
- Did you?

635
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,483
- I did mine.

636
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:03,316
It's all good.
- All right, man.

637
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,268
Tight, man.

638
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:05,101
Say man, relax man.

639
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:05,934
You handled your business, man.

640
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,455
We gonna get you that house in The Bahamas

641
00:28:07,455 --> 00:28:08,516
you always wanted, all right?

642
00:28:08,516 --> 00:28:09,432
- You know that's right.

643
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:10,265
- Okay, dude.

644
00:28:10,265 --> 00:28:11,098
I'll see you, man.
- All right.

645
00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:11,931
- All right.

646
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:12,764
Come here, dog.

647
00:28:12,764 --> 00:28:14,173
Come here, come here.

648
00:28:14,173 --> 00:28:16,640
- [Shoemie] Nugi occasionally
would have private parties

649
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,090
for his people that work for him.

650
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,326
- Yo man, that's right, man.

651
00:28:20,326 --> 00:28:21,360
I heard Shoemie's back in town.

652
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,193
- No shit?

653
00:28:22,193 --> 00:28:23,407
You heard Shoemie's back in town?

654
00:28:23,407 --> 00:28:24,240
- Yeah man.
- Aw man.

655
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,073
That's my homie, man.

656
00:28:25,073 --> 00:28:25,906
I love him.

657
00:28:25,906 --> 00:28:26,739
I always knew that motherfucker

658
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:27,957
was gonna come back to the Oak.

659
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,500
But when he do catch up with us,

660
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,160
he'll be surprised to see
how we run this undergrad

661
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,073
around here, it's tight, shit.

662
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,439
- Man, Shoemie's back?

663
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:38,846
Oh now that's a special man, right there.

664
00:28:38,846 --> 00:28:39,844
- Oh here she comes.

665
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:40,917
- Even back in high school.

666
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:41,840
He had his head together.

667
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,550
He always had his head together.

668
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,627
- Yeah.
- Remember, Nugi?

669
00:28:44,627 --> 00:28:46,544
- You right about that.

670
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,112
- One,

671
00:28:53,112 --> 00:28:53,945
two,

672
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:54,778
three,

673
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:55,635
four,

674
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:56,468
five.

675
00:29:15,692 --> 00:29:18,359
(phone ringing)

676
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:20,725
- Hello?

677
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:23,423
Oh hi, Shoemie.

678
00:29:23,423 --> 00:29:25,052
How are you doing?

679
00:29:25,052 --> 00:29:26,961
I'm glad you called.

680
00:29:26,961 --> 00:29:27,990
Oh no, that's just my sorority sisters.

681
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,546
We're just wrapping up a meeting.

682
00:29:29,546 --> 00:29:32,546
(people chattering)

683
00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:45,551
- Bye, Molly.
- Bye.

684
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,480
- Hey, I was wondering if,

685
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,560
you want to go to the movies or something.

686
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,916
Maybe we can go down

687
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:56,504
to Fisherman's Wharf
of something like that.

688
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:57,700
How's that sound?

689
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,020
- Okay.

690
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,630
Yeah, that sounds good.

691
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,450
- [Woman] Imani, call me.

692
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,650
- Uh-huh.

693
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,513
Okay.

694
00:30:04,513 --> 00:30:06,603
Well yeah, I am a little bit tired.

695
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,603
Okay.

696
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,263
Okay.

697
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:14,957
Well I'd definitely like
to get to know you better.

698
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,503
Okay, Sunday.

699
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,373
Sounds good.

700
00:30:23,373 --> 00:30:25,339
Goodnight to you, too.

701
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:26,172
Bye.

702
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:34,763
- Yeah.

703
00:30:43,888 --> 00:30:46,471
(lively music)

704
00:31:32,112 --> 00:31:34,270
- [Shoemie Voiceover]
Imani and I hit it off big.

705
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,690
We had so much in common

706
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,563
and we shared many interests.

707
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,563
My degree in psychology had paid off.

708
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,010
I was managing director of a group home

709
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,830
of six kids in Oakland, California.

710
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,140
I was able to set this up
through my former college,

711
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,470
University of Washington,
graduate program.

712
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,570
- It's too bad to see Oakland
don't have the Raiders, man.

713
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,570
- Yeah, they never should have left, man.

714
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,937
Never should have left.

715
00:32:06,528 --> 00:32:07,875
- Good morning, Stan.
- Good morning.

716
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,160
- I'm starving like Marvin.

717
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,100
- Hey, fella, how you doing?
- Get in there.

718
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,762
- Sup my negros.
- Hey, there he is.

719
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:15,526
- What's up, white boy?
- What's up.

720
00:32:15,526 --> 00:32:17,684
- Good morning, Sophia, my angel.

721
00:32:17,684 --> 00:32:20,491
- [Sophia] Why don't you
take your hat off, Stan.

722
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:21,475
- May I enter?

723
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:23,225
- Yes you may, Alton.

724
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:27,750
- [Counselor] Hey, no skating
in the hallway, today.

725
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,610
- Why?
- Tomorrow maybe.

726
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,866
Not today.

727
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:32,182
Come on, let's go in for breakfast.

728
00:32:32,182 --> 00:32:33,904
- Where's Sherman and Jake?

729
00:32:33,904 --> 00:32:34,854
- Oh they upstairs.

730
00:32:34,854 --> 00:32:36,722
I don't think they want
to go to Marine World.

731
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:37,555
- Is that right?

732
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:38,388
Tell you what,

733
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:39,268
I'm gonna go upstairs and
I'm gonna go get them.

734
00:32:39,268 --> 00:32:41,768
- I'm going to eat.
- Let's go.

735
00:32:43,704 --> 00:32:45,392
- Good morning, may I enter.

736
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:47,493
- You sure can, after you
put your skateboard away.

737
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,403
- Morning.
- Hey Jim,

738
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:51,964
where's Sherman and Jake?

739
00:32:51,964 --> 00:32:53,873
- [Jim] Oh, Shoemie went
upstairs to get them.

740
00:32:53,873 --> 00:32:56,206
They'll be down in a minute.

741
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:00,590
- Man, I don't want to go
to no dang Marine World.

742
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,820
- Let's do something stupid
so we won't be able to go.

743
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,653
- Hey, I heard that.

744
00:33:03,653 --> 00:33:05,693
Looks like we need an
attitude adjustment here.

745
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:10,013
No matter what you say,
you're going to Marine World.

746
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:11,948
If you want to bring attitude with you,

747
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:15,026
just have to face the consequences
as soon as you get back.

748
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,698
- But that's no fair,
Marine World's boring.

749
00:33:17,698 --> 00:33:20,093
- Regardless of what you say,
you're going to Marine World.

750
00:33:20,093 --> 00:33:21,572
And you'll have a good time.

751
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:23,437
- But Marine World's for kids and punks.

752
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:24,427
- Oh, okay.

753
00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:25,564
Is that right?

754
00:33:25,564 --> 00:33:26,870
Sherman, have you ever
been to Marine World?

755
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,703
- No.

756
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:28,536
- How bout you, Jake?

757
00:33:28,536 --> 00:33:30,220
Well then, how can you judge Marine World,

758
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,130
or anything else for that matter,

759
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,450
if you've never been there?

760
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,870
The bottom line is that it's educational.

761
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,880
And I think you guys will learn

762
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,580
a thing or two about animals.

763
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,870
Now, regardless of how you feel,

764
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,540
the fact that Marine
World's on our agenda today,

765
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,810
you're going.

766
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,890
Now let's go downstairs and have breakfast

767
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,087
and try to have a productive day.

768
00:33:48,087 --> 00:33:49,680
Are you fellas down with that?

769
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,895
- [Both] Yes.

770
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,460
- All right, give me a high five.

771
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,328
Let's go do this.

772
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:55,161
Let's go.

773
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:05,049
- [Shoemie Voiceover] Incredible.

774
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:07,270
All the homies from the old school,

775
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,350
we all hooked up at Bazil's house.

776
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,467
- Where you get this from?

777
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:13,058
- Perfect USDA choice.
- Technology.

778
00:34:13,058 --> 00:34:14,175
- What's up, man?

779
00:34:14,175 --> 00:34:15,575
You all squared for some minutes, man?

780
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:18,325
(men chattering)

781
00:34:21,523 --> 00:34:23,287
- You smoke weed, you always be tripping.

782
00:34:23,287 --> 00:34:24,791
- No no, you the man.

783
00:34:24,791 --> 00:34:25,820
- Check it out, check
it out, check it out.

784
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,013
Classic football stories.
- Aw shit, here we go again.

785
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:31,073
- Remember the time when Shoemie
dropped the touchdown pass.

786
00:34:31,073 --> 00:34:32,803
(men chattering)

787
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:34,590
The fourth quarter of the city game.

788
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,863
- Yeah, but who won the game?

789
00:34:35,863 --> 00:34:36,696
- Well let me finish, man.

790
00:34:36,696 --> 00:34:37,800
- Say man, let's not forget.

791
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,820
What did we hold them to, what?

792
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,420
Seven points or something that game?

793
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,370
(men chattering)

794
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,692
- That's right.

795
00:34:43,692 --> 00:34:44,880
The new school, you know what I'm saying.

796
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,078
- I don't think you'll
ever let us forget that.

797
00:34:47,078 --> 00:34:47,911
- Yeah yeah.
- We know.

798
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:48,860
- You know we shocked everybody with that.

799
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,474
I don't think anybody
expected us to pull that off.

800
00:34:50,474 --> 00:34:51,427
- No.

801
00:34:51,427 --> 00:34:52,260
- Everybody got off, everybody got off.

802
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,354
Although Shoemie, you did
drop the touchdown pass.

803
00:34:55,354 --> 00:34:56,287
- You play too much, man.

804
00:34:56,287 --> 00:34:57,180
- You were all state,

805
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,963
but if you held on to the
rock you'd be All-American.

806
00:34:58,963 --> 00:34:59,998
- Yeah, but that's why I went pro, fool.

807
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:01,424
- I'm telling you.
- Caught my ass.

808
00:35:01,424 --> 00:35:02,257
- Yeah.

809
00:35:03,288 --> 00:35:04,238
- Say man.

810
00:35:04,238 --> 00:35:05,192
- Keep talking that smack, man.

811
00:35:05,192 --> 00:35:06,126
I'm bout to leave you here.

812
00:35:06,126 --> 00:35:07,100
- Give me that.
- Man, come on.

813
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,252
- Give me that.
- God damn.

814
00:35:09,252 --> 00:35:10,678
- Aye yo, y'all think there was gonna be

815
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:11,720
some women at this party, man?

816
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,969
And more importantly, you
won't let me spring my case.

817
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:18,223
(men chattering)

818
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:20,569
- That makes me wish two things, man.

819
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:21,521
- What's that?

820
00:35:21,521 --> 00:35:24,040
- One, that I didn't have to work tonight.

821
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,885
And number two, that I wasn't married.

822
00:35:25,885 --> 00:35:28,270
(men laughing)
(men laughing)

823
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,103
- I wouldn't even trip.

824
00:35:29,103 --> 00:35:31,381
Man, you got a good job and
a wife who's down for you.

825
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:32,214
You can ask anyone.
- What a kick ass mood.

826
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,655
- You know man, I don't know
what I'm thinking about.

827
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:35,790
I guess I'm just tripping.

828
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,623
There it is, I'm tripping.

829
00:35:36,623 --> 00:35:38,571
- Fine hunnies in this gig, tonight.

830
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:42,040
- You know it.
- Squares, probably.

831
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,435
- But you know, there's this one sorority,

832
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:46,011
beautiful women, man.

833
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:50,175
I can guarantee you can
pull me some women there.

834
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:51,373
(smooth music)

835
00:35:51,373 --> 00:35:52,674
- Hi y'all.
- Hi.

836
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:55,674
(people chattering)

837
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:06,920
- Hey, so what's the cover?

838
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,501
- $20.
- Can you read?

839
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:09,908
- $20?
- Mm-hm.

840
00:36:09,908 --> 00:36:11,183
- I thought there was a
part going on up in here.

841
00:36:11,183 --> 00:36:13,432
That's bullshit.
- Oh, okay.

842
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:15,139
This is a fundraiser, okay?

843
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,320
This is a sorority fundraiser for the.

844
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,153
- You know what?

845
00:36:17,153 --> 00:36:18,489
- No, no don't interrupt me.

846
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:19,870
I am not finished.

847
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,896
You are holding up the line.

848
00:36:20,896 --> 00:36:22,505
Take your nickel and dime back over.

849
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:25,653
- I know that cover
couldn't cover you ass.

850
00:36:25,653 --> 00:36:27,153
- Maybe.
- Hell no.

851
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,922
- Okay.

852
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:31,278
Thank you.

853
00:36:31,278 --> 00:36:34,278
(people chattering)

854
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:49,335
- Girl, this party is live.

855
00:36:49,335 --> 00:36:51,299
You see that guy in the black jeans?

856
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:54,424
- You know, nobody back
here's looking this good.

857
00:36:54,424 --> 00:36:55,478
You know what I'm saying?

858
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:58,054
- Girl, don't ever (indistinct).

859
00:36:58,054 --> 00:36:59,293
- You're so negative.

860
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:01,368
- It's good that I'm
very picky with my men,

861
00:37:01,368 --> 00:37:02,888
like you guys should be.

862
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,894
(woman laughing)

863
00:37:04,894 --> 00:37:07,611
- Well, y'all better come on
before we miss all the action.

864
00:37:07,611 --> 00:37:08,611
- All right.

865
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,701
- Now y'all don't be
too fast out there now.

866
00:37:12,701 --> 00:37:13,663
- Good evening, ladies.
- Hi.

867
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:16,663
(people chattering)

868
00:37:17,704 --> 00:37:18,884
- Y'all coming in?

869
00:37:18,884 --> 00:37:20,100
- We'll be in there later.

870
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,559
- Y'all got some ice for this here?

871
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:22,578
- You know you can't bring that in there.

872
00:37:22,578 --> 00:37:23,794
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

873
00:37:23,794 --> 00:37:25,293
- Uh-uh brother, come here.

874
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:27,876
(smooth music)

875
00:37:40,277 --> 00:37:43,419
- Man I hope this party's
hitting man, shit.

876
00:37:43,419 --> 00:37:45,046
- I dig this spot, man.

877
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:47,487
- We gonna have to get post up.

878
00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:49,133
- Hey, well you keep walking with a limp,

879
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,407
you'll never bail mean.

880
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:51,840
Come on, Joshu, you got here.

881
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,286
Let's scope the place out first.

882
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:54,969
- Man, what the fuck you talking about?

883
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:56,427
- Never mind, Joshu.

00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:01,573
- All right, well look,

1062
00:47:01,573 --> 00:47:02,886
we got gang bangers on Fruitvale, man.

1063
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,021
- All right, well let's hit,

1064
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:04,854
let's handle it, let's handle it.

1065
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:10,400
- Like to thank you all
again for coming out tonight

1066
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,310
in support of Epsilon Phi Psi's

1067
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:17,543
first annual jubilee celebration.

1068
00:47:19,349 --> 00:47:22,325
- Yeah, let's do it.

1069
00:47:22,325 --> 00:47:24,340
I'm trying to see you again.

1070
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,880
- Hey, what's going on, good looking?

1071
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,514
How you doing?

1072
00:47:28,514 --> 00:47:29,536
- I'm fine.
- You looking good.

1073
00:47:29,536 --> 00:47:31,390
- I'm surprised to see you here tonight.

1074
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,700
- Aw, you know I'm gonna
try and be anywhere

1075
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,068
you are with your bad self.

1076
00:47:35,068 --> 00:47:38,068
(people chattering)

1077
00:47:40,313 --> 00:47:41,146
- Hi.

1078
00:47:41,146 --> 00:47:41,979
- Imani.
- Hi.

1079
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:42,812
- Hey babe, how you doing?

1080
00:47:42,812 --> 00:47:44,169
- Oh shoot, I'm so glad you could make it.

1081
00:47:44,169 --> 00:47:45,730
- It's good to see you.
- How are you?

1082
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,845
- Oh, I'm okay.

1083
00:47:46,845 --> 00:47:47,797
You look good, baby.

1084
00:47:47,797 --> 00:47:48,750
- Why thank you.

1085
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:49,702
- I know one thing.

1086
00:47:49,702 --> 00:47:50,535
You gonna have to coach me for this thing.

1087
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,368
- You'll survive.

1088
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,259
There's someone I want
to introduce you to.

1089
00:47:52,259 --> 00:47:53,640
- Okay, that's fine.

1090
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,730
- Imani, I haven't seen
you in a long time.

1091
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,593
I won't ask where you've been.

1092
00:47:58,653 --> 00:48:00,310
- Shoemie, this is Marian.

1093
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,439
Marian, this is Shoemie.

1094
00:48:01,439 --> 00:48:02,638
- Nice to meet you, Marian.

1095
00:48:02,638 --> 00:48:03,935
- She's the one that's
responsible for tonight.

1096
00:48:03,935 --> 00:48:04,768
- Oh, okay.

1097
00:48:04,768 --> 00:48:05,601
- [Marian] Thank you for coming out.

1098
00:48:05,601 --> 00:48:06,434
Did you bring any friends?

1099
00:48:06,434 --> 00:48:07,910
- Yes I did.
- Oh, well great.

1100
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:08,967
Well you guys enjoy yourself tonight

1101
00:48:08,967 --> 00:48:09,899
and talk to you later, okay?

1102
00:48:09,899 --> 00:48:13,607
- Thank you.

1103
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:15,274
- Hi Imani.
- Oh, hi.

1104
00:48:16,825 --> 00:48:19,210
- Who do you think you are
not returning my calls?

1105
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,660
And then when you do
decide to call me back,

1106
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,600
it's late at night.

1107
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,557
- I guess you're not happy
with what I'm doing for you?

1108
00:48:24,557 --> 00:48:25,970
- No, I guess not.

1109
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:26,803
- Come here, give me a little kiss.

1110
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:29,660
- No, and you said you were a businessman?

1111
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,010
Yeah, well real businessmen

1112
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:32,880
run their businesses during the day,

1113
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,420
not at three and four in the morning.

1114
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:35,303
- I didn't see you complaining

1115
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:37,150
when I had you bent over that hot tub.

1116
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,258
Come here and stop tripping.

1117
00:48:38,258 --> 00:48:39,310
- Excuse me.

1118
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,143
You know what?

1119
00:48:40,143 --> 00:48:41,540
I thought you were cool.

1120
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:42,555
You know what?

1121
00:48:42,555 --> 00:48:43,508
But you ain't.

1122
00:48:43,508 --> 00:48:44,496
You know what?

1123
00:48:44,496 --> 00:48:45,650
I wish I never would've
gave you the time of day.

1124
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:46,959
- Aw shit, it ain't gotta be like that.

1125
00:48:46,959 --> 00:48:48,660
You stuck on yourself anyway.

1126
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,920
Fuck you, bitch.
- No.

1127
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,987
- Don't you ever try and hit
me in your god damn life.

1128
00:48:51,987 --> 00:48:53,160
Get the fuck away from me.

1129
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,240
- You know what?

1130
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,143
You gonna regret this.
- Fuck you.

1131
00:48:58,171 --> 00:48:59,370
Thanks for sucking my dick.

1132
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:00,253
That a bitch.

1133
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:05,508
- And remember, each one, teach one.

1134
00:49:05,508 --> 00:49:06,341
- All right.
- And now.

1135
00:49:06,341 --> 00:49:08,658
(audience applauding)

1136
00:49:08,658 --> 00:49:11,377
The brothers of Kappa Alpha
Psi Fraternity Incorporated,

1137
00:49:11,377 --> 00:49:13,138
are here for your entertainment.

1138
00:49:13,138 --> 00:49:16,305
(audience applauding)

1139
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:24,285
- What's up, boys?

1140
00:49:26,007 --> 00:49:27,270
- K-A-Psi and.

1141
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:29,056
(feet stomping)

1142
00:49:29,056 --> 00:49:31,639
(men chanting)

1143
00:49:33,055 --> 00:49:35,690
- Imani, can I please speak to you?

1144
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:36,830
Alone, please.

1145
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,370
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

1146
00:49:42,141 --> 00:49:43,357
- Oh God!

1147
00:49:43,357 --> 00:49:45,020
Nugi makes me so sick!

1148
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,520
- What happened between you and Nugi?

1149
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,353
You're so mad.
- Oh, well,

1150
00:49:47,353 --> 00:49:50,320
basically I just told him where he can go.

1151
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,410
You know, I really love my black men,

1152
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,303
but ooh, they just irk me.

1153
00:49:55,303 --> 00:49:56,670
Ooh, I swear.

1154
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,090
He is so self centered.

1155
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,190
All he cares about is himself.

1156
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:01,800
- You don't need that.
- Oh no.

1157
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,360
Girl, he thinks he is all that
and I am just not having it.

1158
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,450
You know, uh-uh.

1159
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,400
I don't even know why
Shoemie hangs out with him.

1160
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,547
- [Men] K-A-Psi, and.

1161
00:50:10,547 --> 00:50:13,214
(feet stomping)

1162
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,378
- Goodnight, ladies.

1163
00:50:23,378 --> 00:50:24,211
- Bye.
- Did you enjoy yourself?

1164
00:50:24,211 --> 00:50:25,044
- Yeah.
- Bye.

1165
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:28,643
- I don't know.

1166
00:50:28,643 --> 00:50:30,934
He's always talking about
some loyalty with brothers.

1167
00:50:30,934 --> 00:50:32,860
Whatever that means.
- Oh, please.

1168
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:36,263
Well girl, I'm gonna get ready to go home.

1169
00:50:36,263 --> 00:50:37,520
I am really tired.

1170
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,590
I just need a hot, warm bubble bath, girl.

1171
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:42,195
Just to calm my nerves.

1172
00:50:42,195 --> 00:50:43,710
- All right, well you
take care, all right?

1173
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,543
- I will girl.

1174
00:50:44,543 --> 00:50:45,414
I'll talk to you, okay?

1175
00:50:45,414 --> 00:50:46,914
- Okay, all right.

1176
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,256
- What's going on with your friend?

1177
00:50:53,256 --> 00:50:54,207
- I don't know.

1178
00:50:54,207 --> 00:50:55,126
Nugi, you know, he's a little hard headed

1179
00:50:55,126 --> 00:50:56,259
but he'll be all right.

1180
00:50:56,259 --> 00:50:58,009
Here, take my jacket.

1181
00:51:00,233 --> 00:51:02,180
Well I'm glad you came,
I had a really good time.

1182
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,436
- Yeah, I did too.

1183
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:05,360
Even though I didn't get to
spend much time with you.

1184
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,550
- Well um, I gotta go help clean up.

1185
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:08,563
Call me when you get home.

1186
00:51:08,563 --> 00:51:09,396
Okay.

1187
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,843
- Call me.
- All right, see you later.

1188
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:28,478
- [Speaker] Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1189
00:51:28,478 --> 00:51:29,630
- [Group] Good evening.

1190
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,663
- I'm glad to be here.

1191
00:51:31,663 --> 00:51:32,620
And especially in honor

1192
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,794
of these beautiful black young women.

1193
00:51:35,794 --> 00:51:38,872
(audience applauding)

1194
00:51:38,872 --> 00:51:39,705
Thank you.

1195
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:41,440
I would like to spread a little knowledge.

1196
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,910
Something I think that every
human being should know.

1197
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:48,270
But first of all, this is not about race.

1198
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:51,120
It's about the understanding
about the color of the face.

1199
00:51:54,249 --> 00:51:55,338
- [Shoemie] What's up, man?

1200
00:51:55,338 --> 00:51:56,171
You all right?

1201
00:51:56,171 --> 00:51:57,004
- No man.

1202
00:51:57,004 --> 00:51:57,916
Shit nigga.

1203
00:51:57,916 --> 00:51:59,450
Say man, I ain't got time
for these silly hoes.

1204
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,674
Man I hate this.

1205
00:52:00,674 --> 00:52:02,450
Man, I didn't have to waste
my time coming to your shit.

1206
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:03,283
- Yo man, look here.

1207
00:52:03,283 --> 00:52:05,790
Let's roll on to the lake and
go to my old spot and talk.

1208
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:06,670
Just like the old times.

1209
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,530
- All right, man, that sounds good, man.

1210
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:09,363
Let me finish this joint.

1211
00:52:09,363 --> 00:52:10,196
Man, you want some?

1212
00:52:10,196 --> 00:52:11,207
- No man, I'm good.

1213
00:52:11,207 --> 00:52:12,180
I don't need that.

1214
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,132
- Aw shit man.

1215
00:52:13,132 --> 00:52:15,000
You don't smoke or drink or
do none of that shit, man.

1216
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,460
You make me feel guilty, man.

1217
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,570
- Yo man, I wouldn't even trip, man.

1218
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,923
I got a lot on my mind these days, man.

1219
00:52:18,923 --> 00:52:20,530
That right there just fucks me up.

1220
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:21,690
I'm on a mission.

1221
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:22,523
- What mission?

1222
00:52:22,523 --> 00:52:23,380
Getting Imani?

1223
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,070
I bet you aint' even kissed her yet.

1224
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:26,022
- Oh, there you go.

1225
00:52:26,022 --> 00:52:26,975
Of course I have.

1226
00:52:26,975 --> 00:52:27,927
- Oh yeah.

1227
00:52:27,927 --> 00:52:28,880
How come I think you lying?

1228
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,224
No playing, homie?

1229
00:52:30,224 --> 00:52:31,057
- Nah man.

1230
00:52:31,057 --> 00:52:31,890
But you know what?

1231
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:32,723
Screw it, man.

1232
00:52:32,723 --> 00:52:33,806
Yeah, aw man.

1233
00:53:02,524 --> 00:53:04,651
- [Nugi] Hey man, I always
like it out here, man.

1234
00:53:04,651 --> 00:53:05,609
It's always peaceful and shit, you know?

1235
00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:06,546
- [Shoemie] Nice, fresh air.

1236
00:53:06,546 --> 00:53:09,623
- Get my mind off them bitches and shit.

1237
00:53:09,623 --> 00:53:11,147
- Tell me something, Nugi, man.

1238
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:12,410
Do you have any fears?

1239
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:14,040
- Ah Shoe, I ain't afraid of nothing, man.

1240
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,361
What you getting at?

1241
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:16,311
- I don't know man.

1242
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:18,230
Do you ever think about tomorrow?

1243
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,570
- Ain't no tomorrow, man.

1244
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,090
It's all about today.

1245
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:22,120
I know what you getting at, though.

1246
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,460
You just shocked at how
I'm living, ain't you?

1247
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,560
- Nah, brother, I ain't shocked.

1248
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,530
I'm a little surprised.

1249
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:29,081
I didn't know you were
involved so deep in the game.

1250
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:30,033
From what I understand,

1251
00:53:30,033 --> 00:53:31,000
you're pretty large out
there in the streets.

1252
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,920
- Gotta do what I gotta do.

1253
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,530
Say man, remember when
you got on the plane

1254
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:35,590
to go to UW, man?

1255
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:37,476
Remember what you said to me, man?

1256
00:53:37,476 --> 00:53:38,428
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

1257
00:53:38,428 --> 00:53:39,261
- You said something about consequences

1258
00:53:39,261 --> 00:53:40,815
and about being the best at whatever I do.

1259
00:53:40,815 --> 00:53:41,947
- Right, right.

1260
00:53:41,947 --> 00:53:42,898
I do remember.

1261
00:53:42,898 --> 00:53:43,849
- I'm just an example of that, man.

1262
00:53:43,849 --> 00:53:44,930
- I do remember.

1263
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:45,763
I do remember, man.

1264
00:53:45,763 --> 00:53:47,300
We would go to Center Park.

1265
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,593
- Yeah man.

1266
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:51,490
- [Shoemie] Man, we was
knocking clowns out.

1267
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:53,800
- Yup, I remember that shit.

1268
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,633
Damn.

1269
00:53:55,955 --> 00:53:58,440
- [Shoemie Voiceover] In my
first summer out of high school,

1270
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,880
we would go to the park in East Oakland

1271
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:04,070
and participate and bet on boxing matches.

1272
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,820
We made a lot of money that summer.

1273
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,138
And occasionally some punk would jump up.

1274
00:54:09,138 --> 00:54:12,138
(people chattering)

1275
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:19,987
(people yelling)

1276
00:54:30,723 --> 00:54:31,919
- Come on, punk.

1277
00:54:31,919 --> 00:54:34,582
(people chattering)

1278
00:54:34,582 --> 00:54:36,021
- Round three.

1279
00:54:36,021 --> 00:54:37,622
Fight!

1280
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:40,372
(people yelling)

1281
00:54:48,086 --> 00:54:50,680
(punch landing)

1282
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,430
(people yelling)

1283
00:54:59,609 --> 00:55:00,658
One,

1284
00:55:00,658 --> 00:55:01,656
two,

1285
00:55:01,656 --> 00:55:02,852
three!

1286
00:55:02,852 --> 00:55:03,811
The winner.

1287
00:55:03,811 --> 00:55:06,561
(people yelling)

1288
00:55:17,785 --> 00:55:18,740
- Get your ass.

1289
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,677
Come on, Paul!

1290
00:55:19,677 --> 00:55:20,533
Come on, come on.

1291
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:21,728
We'll get another motherfucker.

1292
00:55:21,728 --> 00:55:23,471
Good bye, bitch, good bye.

1293
00:55:23,471 --> 00:55:25,052
- Behind the street, behind the street.

1294
00:55:25,052 --> 00:55:27,969
Put the gun down, put the gun down.

1295
00:55:28,939 --> 00:55:29,772
- Yeah, what's up?

1296
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:31,426
Get behind me, Nugi.

1297
00:55:31,426 --> 00:55:34,176
(people yelling)

1298
00:55:38,094 --> 00:55:40,032
- Man.
- I remember that shit.

1299
00:55:40,032 --> 00:55:42,750
- But you definitely took
it the wrong way, man.

1300
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,600
I just expected better from you, man.

1301
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,553
On another hand,

1302
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:48,615
a brothers gotta do what
he's gotta do to survive.

1303
00:55:48,615 --> 00:55:50,625
- Say man, it's like
hard die out here, Shoe.

1304
00:55:50,625 --> 00:55:53,604
You know I got my tombstone
already laid out, man.

1305
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:54,437
- Come on.

1306
00:55:54,437 --> 00:55:55,270
- I accept any and all consequences

1307
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:56,913
that lay in the path that I chose, man.

1308
00:55:56,913 --> 00:55:58,083
This is what I do, man.

1309
00:55:58,083 --> 00:55:59,853
I don't give a fuck, man, it's what I do.

1310
00:55:59,853 --> 00:56:01,318
When I'm tired of this.

1311
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:02,732
Man, let's go.

1312
00:56:02,732 --> 00:56:05,120
- Yeah, I'm a little tired
myself and I'm ready to go home.

1313
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,587
- Shit.

1314
00:56:06,587 --> 00:56:07,945
The night just begun for me, homie.

1315
00:56:07,945 --> 00:56:09,017
You know what I'm saying?

1316
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:22,902
- [Shoemie Voiceover] I don't know.

1317
00:56:22,902 --> 00:56:25,863
Something felt different
about this moment, and night.

1318
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:29,590
I guess we can't relive the past.

1319
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,553
We wish.

1320
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,873
But as time goes on, we
all grow differently.

1321
00:56:37,028 --> 00:56:39,528
(tense music)

1322
00:56:42,496 --> 00:56:43,913
- You right here?

1323
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,605
- Yo man, thanks for the ride, man.

1324
00:56:49,605 --> 00:56:50,823
I can walk home from here.
- All right.

1325
00:56:50,823 --> 00:56:51,876
Everything all right, man?
- Yeah.

1326
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:52,709
- All right, dude.
- Take it easy.

1327
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:53,730
I love you, man.

1328
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:57,700
Call me tomorrow, something.
(phone ringing)

1329
00:57:00,013 --> 00:57:02,763
(dramatic music)

1330
00:57:16,861 --> 00:57:18,920
- [Shoemie Voiceover] If I
ever felt distant from Nugi,

1331
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:20,553
now was definitely the time.

1332
00:57:27,427 --> 00:57:28,765
- Hey, hey check this out.

1333
00:57:28,765 --> 00:57:30,450
You called me, and I
ain't even hearing that.

1334
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:32,240
You got me, you got me three weeks ago

1335
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,230
and I ain't even hearing that.

1336
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:34,080
- Angela, call the police.

1337
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,760
You gots to go, you gots to, see ya.

1338
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,310
Go, she's calling the police.

1339
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:38,580
Peace, gotta go.

1340
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,641
- Man, cracker.

1341
00:57:39,641 --> 00:57:40,839
It ain't even like that.

1342
00:57:40,839 --> 00:57:42,450
It ain't even like that no more.

1343
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:45,147
I ain't doing nothing for you.

1344
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:50,620
- Antonette, why are we stopping here?

1345
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,750
Andrea's right up the street.

1346
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:52,583
- Oh, don't worry.

1347
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:54,585
This is a good place to eat.

1348
00:57:54,585 --> 00:57:57,801
- Okay.
- Don't worry, it's safe.

1349
00:57:57,801 --> 00:58:00,551
(people yelling)

1350
00:58:07,096 --> 00:58:08,269
- How you doing there, ladies?

1351
00:58:08,269 --> 00:58:09,224
- [Both] Fine.

1352
00:58:09,224 --> 00:58:10,177
- It's pretty late, damn.

1353
00:58:10,177 --> 00:58:12,993
Check this out, get an order
and I'm gonna ring y'all up.

1354
00:58:13,995 --> 00:58:15,781
- Okay, a Vin's burger

1355
00:58:15,781 --> 00:58:18,171
with mustard and
mayonnaise and large Coke.

1356
00:58:18,171 --> 00:58:20,003
- I'll have the same, without mustard.

1357
00:58:20,003 --> 00:58:22,638
- You want the special, man,
with these burgers, boy.

1358
00:58:22,638 --> 00:58:23,650
That's all good.

1359
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:25,340
I'll tell you what ladies,
in like three minutes.

1360
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:29,022
everything will be ready and
y'all pay me later, all right?

1361
00:58:29,022 --> 00:58:29,995
Sounds good?

1362
00:58:29,995 --> 00:58:32,199
- All right.
- All right.

1363
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:33,037
Kind of rough out there.

1364
00:58:33,037 --> 00:58:34,277
Y'all should hang out in here with me.

1365
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:35,940
You know what I'm saying?

1366
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,690
(dramatic music)

1367
00:59:08,676 --> 00:59:09,509
- Ah, man.

1368
00:59:11,371 --> 00:59:12,954
It's the wrong day.

1369
00:59:30,977 --> 00:59:31,810
Oh boy.

1370
00:59:47,234 --> 00:59:48,592
- Hey, y'all looking good over there.

1371
00:59:48,592 --> 00:59:49,545
I'll be back.

1372
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:50,497
- Could you spare a dollar?

1373
00:59:50,497 --> 00:59:51,470
- Get your ass off me.

1374
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:52,548
- Well you're a fine piece of shit.

1375
00:59:52,548 --> 00:59:53,500
- You're pathetic.

1376
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,875
Go back up under your rock.
- You going to hell!

1377
00:59:54,875 --> 00:59:56,081
- Go back up under your
rock and leave me alone.

1378
00:59:56,081 --> 00:59:57,033
- You know what?

1379
00:59:57,033 --> 01:00:00,616
I could be, I could be
your guardian angel.

1380
01:00:05,646 --> 01:00:06,599
- This man a player.

1381
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:07,760
What's up, player?
- Get outta here.

1382
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,257
- I been seeing you around something.

1383
01:00:10,257 --> 01:00:11,976
- You have homeless people out here, man.

1384
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:13,297
All right, I'm your customer.

1385
01:00:13,297 --> 01:00:14,251
What's up, man?

1386
01:00:14,251 --> 01:00:15,203
What's up, G?

1387
01:00:15,203 --> 01:00:16,156
- Working hard, G.

1388
01:00:16,156 --> 01:00:17,149
She's gonna take your order,
I'm just gonna ring you up.

1389
01:00:17,149 --> 01:00:18,390
- Oh yeah, you looking good

1390
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:19,410
with them little nice
fingernails right there.

1391
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:21,430
That's all right, though, check this out.

1392
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:23,360
Give me about two cheeseburgers,

1393
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,070
order of fries or
something, a little soda.

1394
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,590
Put plenty of salt on it.

1395
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,823
Put some extra sugar in
that soda, all right?

1396
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:32,941
- I'll tell you what, player.

1397
01:00:32,941 --> 01:00:35,130
In about three minutes it's
all gonna be good and ready.

1398
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:36,081
- All right.

1399
01:00:36,081 --> 01:00:37,030
- Pay me later, huh?

1400
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:37,863
- Hey, man,

1401
01:00:37,863 --> 01:00:38,696
I'm gonna get at these little
snow bunnies out here, man.

1402
01:00:38,696 --> 01:00:39,529
- I feel you, man.
- All right, dude.

1403
01:00:39,529 --> 01:00:40,362
- Dang.

1404
01:00:42,313 --> 01:00:43,387
Hey, what's going on, good looking?

1405
01:00:43,387 --> 01:00:45,513
My name's Nugi, what's yours?

1406
01:00:45,513 --> 01:00:46,467
- Heather.

1407
01:00:46,467 --> 01:00:47,418
- How you doing, Heather?

1408
01:00:47,418 --> 01:00:48,677
And what's your name, good looking?

1409
01:00:48,677 --> 01:00:49,710

It was you, the citizens of this city

2108
01:28:44,910 --> 01:28:47,283
that made this dream a reality.

2109
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:51,690
I, along with the city
council wish to thank you,

2110
01:28:51,690 --> 01:28:53,690
the people, for your support.

2111
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:55,890
We're making changes
in the right direction,

2112
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:58,400
and it's only going to get better.

2113
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:02,520
Those of you that wish to
sign up on the job list,

2114
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:06,060
please put your name and
address on the bulletin board.

2115
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:08,453
Again, thank you for attending.

2116
01:29:09,730 --> 01:29:12,210
- [Announcer] Good evening, from KDEB TV3.

2117
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:14,160
This is the award winning Nightly News.

2118
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:19,193
- Good evening, I'm Sherri Gonzales.

2119
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:21,880
We begin tonight with the story

2120
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:25,190
of Oakland City officials
and residents coming together

2121
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:27,240
to fight the growing problem of violence

2122
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,550
and drug dealing in this city.

2123
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:32,240
Tonight more than 3000 Oakland residents

2124
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:36,020
packed a neighborhood forum
meeting in central Oakland.

2125
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:38,500
The mayor spoke and told
them that the young people

2126
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:41,290
must have viable alternatives to hang.

2127
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:43,690
- Yeah, I knew that all the time.

2128
01:29:43,690 --> 01:29:46,875
- Positive part-time jobs
for Oakland's teenagers.

2129
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:50,120
In addition, the mayor said a petition

2130
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:53,310
signed by over 50,000 Oakland residents

2131
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:55,350
will be sent to Sacramento.

2132
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:57,780
The petition demands
the $1 million to start

2133
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:01,650
new afterschool programs
and to continue to support

2134
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:04,188
those already established by the mayor.

2135
01:30:04,188 --> 01:30:05,670
- It's what we've been
needing all the time.

2136
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:08,500
- [Sherri] Businesses and
thousands of city residents

2137
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,850
have already pledged to
match the $1 million.

2138
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:14,410
- Y'all, it's about time
y'all make that change.

2139
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:16,254
- A little later on this newscast,

2140
01:30:16,254 --> 01:30:17,588
we will have, with the mayor,

2141
01:30:17,588 --> 01:30:21,633
from the scenes of that town
meeting in Central Oakland.

2142
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:26,678
- Fellas let's, let's
go get something to eat.

2143
01:30:26,678 --> 01:30:27,651
- That's real good right about now.

2144
01:30:27,651 --> 01:30:29,920
- Before we leave, let's
say a word of prayer.

2145
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:30,753
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

2146
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:38,460
- Father God, I pray that
you be over this grave.

2147
01:30:38,460 --> 01:30:39,890
Just watch over Nugi.

2148
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:42,940
God, none of us know which
direction we're going,

2149
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:44,630
Father God, when we leave here,

2150
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:46,880
and we do pray that
you tell us Father God.

2151
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,007
So many, in so many ways,
how to be right before you.

2152
01:30:50,007 --> 01:30:51,245
God I pray for Nugi's soul.

2153
01:30:51,245 --> 01:30:53,210
I pray that the rest of us, Father God,

2154
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:54,870
can always remember him in a good light

2155
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:57,020
that he shed in our lives, God.

2156
01:30:57,020 --> 01:31:00,190
Just like Shoemie was saying,
think of the positive things.

2157
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:02,230
God it's so clear that
we gotta stick tougher,

2158
01:31:02,230 --> 01:31:03,810
stick tighter together.

2159
01:31:03,810 --> 01:31:05,300
God, we appreciate just this time,

2160
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:07,501
being able to come here
just to reflect on him,

2161
01:31:07,501 --> 01:31:09,140
and we do miss him so much.

2162
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:11,400
And it's in Jesus' name that we pray.

2163
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,413
Amen.
- Amen.

2164
01:31:19,027 --> 01:31:21,740
- [Shoemie Voiceover] I
