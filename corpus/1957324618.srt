1
00:00:40,012 --> 00:00:41,980
We're finally going
to get to see.

2
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:43,994
<i>Super Ultra Death Woman 4.</i>

3
00:00:44,018 --> 00:00:45,984
The Deathening.

4
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:47,408
She'll chew you up
and spit you out.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,991
She's tough as nails and
harder than an old biscuit.

6
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:50,994
I had a nightmare

7
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:52,984
I was a biscuit once.

8
00:00:53,008 --> 00:00:54,981
That's why I'm gluten free.

9
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:56,979
It's going to be so cool.

10
00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:58,443
My daddy won't tell
me what death is,

11
00:00:59,001 --> 00:00:59,997
so I'm excited to learn about it

12
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:01,986
not only from an expert,

13
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,988
but a woman.

14
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:04,984
I hate these kinds of movies,

15
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:07,997
but I fear if I keep
rejecting your invitations

16
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:10,982
you'll stop inviting
me to things.

17
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:11,991
You're right to think so.

18
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:13,997
Now, come on. Let's
go see a dang movie.

19
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:18,981
Hi. Three tickets for
<i>The Deathening, please.</i>

20
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:20,980
No, not so fast, kiddos.

21
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:23,991
You little buddies are a bit too
young for such a violent movie.

22
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:27,986
I know the perfect movie for
you guys to watch instead.

23
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,984
<i>Baby Dooky Dum Dum 6,</i>

24
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:31,978
This time they suck
on a big pinky.

25
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:32,999
<i>Baby Dooky Dum Dum 6?</i>

26
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:34,983
That movie is the worst.

27
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:35,997
I mean, one through
three were good,

28
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:37,998
but man, they lost
the plot after four.

29
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:42,000
Come on, guys, if they want a
grown-up, we'll give them a grown-up.

30
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:48,281
Now we'll get
treated like adults

31
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:50,980
or at least just one adult.

32
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:51,984
Augie?

33
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:53,986
You really think
this is gonna work?

34
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,996
'Course it will. We're hot now.

35
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,991
Whoa.

36
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:01,983
Oh, wow. That cloud
looks like a worm.

37
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:02,990
Uh, excuse me.

38
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:05,986
A man with the voice of a child.

39
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,020
Oh what? No, no, no, no.

40
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:09,989
Uhh, I'm an adult.

41
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:10,998
Oh, my bad, pal.

42
00:02:11,022 --> 00:02:13,018
He's as slow as
molasses in January.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,020
So, how can I help you?

44
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:20,001
One ticket for <i>The
Deathening, please.</i>

45
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:24,987
Huh. I can't help but
think you look familiar.

46
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:25,998
Where do I know you from?

47
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:28,987
Oh, um... perhaps
you've heard of us.

48
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:32,980
I mean, me, I am,
uh, Mr. Flabby.

49
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:34,001
- Dabby.
- Wabby.

50
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:37,992
Jabby? Yes, I'm Mr. Fabby
Dabby Wabby Jabby,

51
00:02:38,016 --> 00:02:39,978
and I'm a prominent lawyer

52
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:41,990
and I own a manor...
with Ponies.

53
00:02:42,014 --> 00:02:43,990
Hmm.

54
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:45,979
If he knows we're lying,

55
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:47,991
he's gonna call the cops.

56
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:51,979
Oh, I probably just saw you
in super-hot yoga with Debbie.

57
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:52,996
Here ya go.

58
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,980
Yes. Finally.

59
00:02:55,004 --> 00:02:56,991
Did somebody here
say they're a lawyer?

60
00:02:57,015 --> 00:03:00,995
I need one immediately
for a law emergency.

61
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,989
Oh, yeah. This guy's a lawyer.

62
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:03,988
Uh, what?

63
00:03:04,012 --> 00:03:04,999
The cops actually came.

64
00:03:05,023 --> 00:03:06,999
What are we going to do?
We can't lie to a cop.

65
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:09,988
Yes, that's me.

66
00:03:10,012 --> 00:03:11,993
An adult who's a lawyer.

67
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:12,996
Thank goodness.

68
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,000
Come with me.

69
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:18,993
Order! Order in the court.

70
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:21,997
I swear, the body was
already dead when I found it.

71
00:03:22,021 --> 00:03:23,992
Oh, I gotta...

72
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:25,979
Gimme one sec.

73
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:26,982
Guys, what do I do?

74
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,980
I've never been a lawyer before.

75
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:29,992
Just say something.

76
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:31,991
Anything.

77
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,984
'Cause if you don't, we'll never
get to see <i>Super Ultra Death Woman,</i>

78
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:35,981
and they will arrest us.

79
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:39,005
I can't get my one thousand good
night kisses from my daddy in jail.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,989
Hmm. Something smells fishy.

81
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:44,989
And it's not Wally
Gator for once.

82
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:46,023
Oh, thank goodness.

83
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:47,997
Why are you taking so long?

84
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:49,987
Have you got something to hide?

85
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:51,978
This is a court of truth.

86
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:54,993
Uh, permission to
approach the bench?

87
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:57,007
Oh, sure. Talk to me, babe.

88
00:03:59,012 --> 00:04:01,022
What's up? Let's
chiggidy-chat, yo.

89
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,988
Well, uh, you see
it was in my head

90
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:04,999
and I was having thoughts.

91
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:06,986
Thoughts, you know,
thoughts inside my head,

92
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,980
and while I was thinking,
it led me to a thought

93
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:11,001
which led me to think

94
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:13,979
uh... where's the potty?

95
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:14,989
Oh, that's easy.

96
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:16,021
It's down the hall...

97
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:22,024
Not guilty.

98
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:25,021
I'm not going to jail!

99
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,992
My gosh, we did it.

100
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:33,998
Hooray!

101
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:35,989
Get milked, ding dongs.

102
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:38,981
Ah, yes. Thank you. Thank you.

103
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:40,205
Mr. Flabby Grabby Jabby Jabby,

104
00:04:41,001 --> 00:04:42,986
you cracked the toughest
case in Jellystone history

105
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,995
and you're polling in at a
100% smartest guy in town.

106
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,019
Will you run for mayor?

107
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:48,993
Uhhh...

108
00:04:49,017 --> 00:04:50,983
Just say yes or we
will never get to see.

109
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:52,986
<i>The Deathening.</i>

110
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,987
Uhhh... Get with it.

111
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:55,998
Yes, we will.

112
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:59,007
I mean, me... will
run for mayor.

113
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:05,993
Mr. Crabby, Crabby, Crabby...

114
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:09,017
What's your stance on Corporate
Megamergers and Trans-Pacific Partnerships?

115
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,018
I like... ponies.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,010
Can't argue with that.

117
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:17,987
What?

118
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,990
You know, we all should
just skip the election

119
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:21,990
to make him mayor right now.

120
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:22,991
I concede.

121
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:24,015
What?

122
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,997
How did it come to this?

123
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:32,984
I just wanted to
see a dang movie.

124
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:35,981
And now we have to
work in big government.

125
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:36,987
Just one more in,

126
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:39,987
and that's all my
tiny wooden cups.

127
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:44,011
This really is the end of
an era for old Huckleberry.

128
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:46,995
Now wait, just a minute here...

129
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,992
Ahhh!

130
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,982
Why'd you blow our cover?

131
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:51,994
Hey, it's hard work being legs.

132
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,986
My blood sugar's gettin' low.

133
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,986
We've gone too far, Augie.

134
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,997
You can't bonk the ex-mayor.

135
00:05:58,021 --> 00:05:59,994
Relax, Yakky.

136
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:02,996
I just activated a chakra point
on his head to put him into a coma

137
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,985
using defensive jutsu
my daddy taught me.

138
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:07,980
Sick.

139
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:09,991
We're going to see
<i>The Deathening.</i>

140
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:11,984
Even if we have to die.

141
00:06:12,008 --> 00:06:14,984
Augie, I should just tell
you now, death isn't...

142
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,980
No. Spoilers!

143
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:17,989
Mr. Mayor? Mr. Mayor?
Mr. Mayor...

144
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:19,013
Come on, guys.

145
00:06:22,002 --> 00:06:22,988
Yeah, come... come.

146
00:06:23,012 --> 00:06:24,992
Uh, come in.

147
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:26,989
Oh, it's so horrible, Mr. Mayor.

148
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:30,000
An alien mothership has landed
in Jellystone Town Square,

149
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:31,988
and they want to see
the town's leader,

150
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:34,002
or they'll destroy us all.

151
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,990
Set quadrants four, five and
seven in medium frequency

152
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:40,980
and increase the
amp by 5.7 notches.

153
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:41,991
Where the heck is the mayor?

154
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:43,984
Reporting for duty.

155
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,999
Uh, are the aliens real aliens?

156
00:06:47,023 --> 00:06:49,995
I can't see past Granny's
withered ol' tush.

157
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:51,989
It's like a dream.

158
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:53,980
Let me fill you in, Mr. Mayor.

159
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:55,991
We've managed to establish
communication with the alien

160
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,987
on a primitive
level using sound.

161
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:59,021
Allow me to demonstrate.

162
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:07,980
They say to hurry up and
bring them our leaders

163
00:07:08,004 --> 00:07:10,001
so they can pass judgment
on our civilization.

164
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:12,987
You're our only hope, Mr. Mayor.

165
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:14,984
Well, here goes nothing.

166
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:17,008
Yeah. Go get him, Mr. Mayor.

167
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:19,999
Oh. Uh...

168
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,023
Hello.

169
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:29,015
Oh, my gosh. He's so ugly.

170
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:32,985
Guys, guys. What do I do?

171
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:35,997
Well, in Nippon, people
bow as a form of respect.

172
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:39,999
Um, welcome to Jellystone,
handsome traveler.

173
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:42,983
Okay, we are bowing now.

174
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:44,998
This is hard when there's
like two extra butts in here.

175
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:47,997
I'm trying to hold.

176
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:49,984
What's he doing?

177
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:52,018
I can't hold it much longer.

178
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:56,990
Please, Please, Please,
please, please, please, please.

179
00:07:57,014 --> 00:08:01,024
Bleep.

180
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:04,011
I'm slipping!

181
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:06,989
Yackky, no.

182
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:10,023
Bleep.

183
00:08:12,017 --> 00:08:13,017
Bleep.

184
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:17,994
Okay, everything's fine now.

185
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:20,983
The alien went underground
to go to sleep.

186
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:22,995
Yay! Whoo-hoo!

187
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,982
Are you okay, Yakky?

188
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:26,996
My life flashed before my eyes.

189
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,986
It was short.

190
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,210
Oh, why does this guy smell
like Momma's hot bean steak?

191
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:36,988
Look, there's the hero
who saved us from aliens.

192
00:08:37,012 --> 00:08:38,991
Hmm. He's as big as Europe.

193
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:40,991
Hey, over here, big guy.

194
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:43,982
I think we're in
the clear, guys.

195
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,979
You mean we can go see...

196
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:49,013
<i>The Deathening?</i>

197
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:53,003
Finally, it's time.

198
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:56,009
Let's do this.

199
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:00,982
Excuse me.

200
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:03,985
One ticket for <i>The
Deathening, please.</i>

201
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,982
Hey, you're that
guy from earlier,

202
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:08,016
or did you put on some
sick gains, brother?

203
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:10,321
- Yes.
- Well, here's your ticket.

204
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,010
From one big buff
boy to another.

205
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:16,983
Got it!

206
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:17,991
Nuts.

207
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:18,992
The... the...

208
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,981
The buddies from earlier.

209
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:23,981
Oh, we were so close.

210
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:26,987
At least I could
hold you just once.

211
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:28,987
You can arrest us now.

212
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:29,998
Just be gentle.

213
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:31,998
Oh, you wish I would arrest you.

214
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,987
Not only did I almost
let six people in

215
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:36,131
for the price of one ticket,

216
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,980
but I nearly let you pure,
innocent, tiny children

217
00:09:41,004 --> 00:09:42,980
see a movie that
is way too violent

218
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:47,986
and much too mature for your
little, tiny, infant, baby ages.

219
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,020
And now you forced me
to have to give you

220
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,987
the big boot.

221
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:56,011
Now turn your tiny butts
around so I can kick them.

222
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,995
Now, what's all this then?

223
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,995
The real Mr. Flabby,
Wabby, Jabby?

224
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,993
Word got lost between here and
my cottage on the north side.

225
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:10,998
It's come to my understanding
that you lot have been doing

226
00:10:11,022 --> 00:10:13,990
quite a good job
filling in for me.

227
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,981
Now, Mr. Concierge,

228
00:10:17,005 --> 00:10:19,995
sir, I do believe, it
is within movie law

229
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,986
that young fellows may be
admitted to the theater

230
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,997
with an adult of
appropriate age.

231
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:30,985
In this case, it would
be yours truly. Wot? Wot?

232
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:31,984
Huh?

233
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:32,990
Well, what do you know?

234
00:10:33,014 --> 00:10:34,982
It's right here
in the rule book.

235
00:10:35,006 --> 00:10:36,990
Right next to, "Thou shalt
not text during movies."

236
00:10:37,014 --> 00:10:38,980
Hooray!

237
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:40,024
Here are your tickets.

238
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:41,998
Our hardships are finally over.

239
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:44,002
Oh, this will be a
night to remember.

240
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:48,983
You've had this coming for
a long time, Demon man.

241
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:50,979
Prepare for The Deathening.

242
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:52,013
Care for some popcorn?

243
00:10:54,006 --> 00:10:56,987
You could have told me
death was gonna be so juicy.

244
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:59,988
I want my mama and a big binkie.

245
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:01,981
It's like my dreams...

246
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:03,005
But I'm awake.
