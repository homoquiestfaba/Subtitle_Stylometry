You're all set, Mr.
Lewis. Thanks, man.

4
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:44,605
So where ya off to this weekend? 
Oh, just headed down to Fort Walton.

5
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:48,909
Heard it's nice. You've never been? 
Bubbs, you could drive down there.

6
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,578
Yeah, well, have a good one alright?

7
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,515

What was wrong with it? Nothin'.

11
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:25,179
Hey, we get anything good? Books, 
clothes. You want something,

12
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:29,183
Better grab it, 'cause I'm taking it in 
tomorrow. Hey, you mind if I take this?

13
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:34,121
Take it. Frank's back.

14
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,759
I really don't give a shit, but I know your
Mama does which means when you see him...

15
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:42,129
she's gonna find out about it, she's gonna 
call me and complain about it.

16
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,299
And that makes me give a shit. And giving 
a shit just pisses me off.

17
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,767
So don't do it.

18
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,668
Anything else, Grant?

19
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:51,405
Yeah, smart ass, your girlfriend called.

20
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:59,580
"Hey, it's Jess. Leave a message." Hey, 
just callin' ya back.

21
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:03,584
Down here with Ma'n them, ya need me.

22
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,819
Point being, I heard he was back in town

23
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:08,155
And I just thought maybe you'd wanna know.

24
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:12,159
Hey! What'd she want? Ah, who knows?

25
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:16,397
Maybe she's cheating on you. Stepping out!

26
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,567
Well you'd know all about
that, wouldn't ya, Gary? No! Hey,
Ma, how many

27
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,836
All his exes used the term "tradin' up" 
when describin' why they dump?

28
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,405
Well, actually, Bubbs...

29
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:28,642
"Trading up" got trumped by "unemployed"
every time.

30
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:32,580
How's it going? Great. I ain't
had one all day.

31
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:36,417
Proud of you. Don't know how
you do it, though, cold-turkey.

32
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,753
I couldn't do it. I have to
use the gum or something.

33
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:43,624
Ah, whatever works. What
y'all talkin' about?

34
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:48,729
Mary just quit smoking. And
to up the ante, Gary and I
are betting that she

35
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,399
Can last for the next couple
of months without sliding.

36
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,901
And seeing as how Gary
hasn't had a job or money

37
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,769
Since the three of us was in
high school...

38
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:59,640
Hey, what about when I
was... Selling meth don't count.

39
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:04,745
Anyway, wager is whoever loses has 
to clean the "john" back there.

40
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,682
Now I'm betting she can do it. But, Gary 
being the supportive optimist he is,

41
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:11,919
Is betting she can't, and Kenny, 
meanwhile my poor restroom's been

42
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:15,789
Back there festering for a
week. Is that what that was?

43
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:21,161
Yeah, and Gary's unholy addiction to 
chili dogs. She's right about that,

44
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:25,165
I do love the chili dogs.

45
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:29,903
What? They're good.

00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:33,907
[Music] I know, I know,
not the most reputable source.

47
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:37,845
But Gary does have his
finger on the pulse of that "community."

48
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:41,248
Ya mean the drunks? [Laughter]
Don't worry,

49
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,586
Ma, Grant told me the same thing
today. Listen, Bubbs,

50
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,921
I know that we've gone in
circles with this in the past.

51
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,923
But I was just hoping that

52
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:54,061
We could nip it in the bud now
and be done with it. Ma, c'mon...

53
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:58,799
Just promise me that you won't
see him this time, alright?
[The kitchen phone rings.]

54
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:02,670
It's probably Jess.

Alright, alright...

00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:10,744
Hello?

00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:14,715

I'm finishin' up right now.
I called you back.

long's this been going on?

60
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:26,894
Awhile. And we're moving to
Tampa. Jesus Christ, Jess, is
there anything else?

61
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,563
No, that's it. What the
hell's in Tampa?

62
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:33,734
Aaron got a job there and I'm
going with him. A job? Aaron
ain't worked a day in his life.

63
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:36,470
He's gonna end up at his Daddy's
goddamn dealership just like his
brothers!

Well at least he's trying
something different!

00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:41,775
He ain't "tryin'" to do
nothin' but get in your pants!

66
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:45,379
You know what? Screw you,
Bubbs! We love each other
and we're making a move.

67
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:50,784
Which is a hell of a lot more
than I can say for you. Yeah,
what's that supposed to mean?

68
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:54,822
You haven't changed since
high school. You have the
same job,

69
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:59,059
The same friends and you
still live with your Mama.
It's fucking sad.

70
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:03,163
Yeah, what about Kenny? He still
lives with his Pops. Well, then
you two deserve each other.

71
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:09,236
Hey, that is not fair. You
know my situation, alright?

72
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,171
You're right, I
do.

73
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,375
But that's not what I want in
a boyfriend.

74
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:19,246
Do you know why I stayed
with you?

75
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,283
I thought I saw something.
Anytime you'd talk about
Frank

76
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:27,320
Or where someone was going
at work, you'd just light
up.

77
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:31,391
I thought that maybe one day
you'd warm to the idea
yourself

78
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:35,463
And we'd actually be some of
the people to leave this
place, but you never did.

79
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:37,397
You're going nowhere, Bubbs,
and if I stay,

I'll end up too.

chained to the deck

No, retard, we're getting
married. Oh, really?

00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,803
Yeah, he asked me a couple
months ago. Ya know he likes
guys, right?

91
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:53,807
Fuck off, Frank!
Robert, he's
joking.

92
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:57,878
No, it's always the same shit
with this guy. And I'm
getting tired of it.

93
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:01,882
Stay away from my
fiancé.

She ain't your
type. "Not my
type?"

95
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:10,090
You're a juvenile, Frank, and
a delinquent at that.

96
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:14,027
And by some miraculous act
of God you're not locked-up
or dead,

97
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,929
But that's where your luck
runs out. 'Cause you know
what?

98
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,198
You're just a
functioning alcoholic,

and with the exception of
your Grandson,

100

have, don't want nothing to
do with you.

won't quit. All natural, too.

102

I'm warning you, Frank.
Listen, Rob, even if I gave
a shit it wouldn't matter.

Oh, yeah? And why's
that?

Cayo Paraiso, it's like

themselves "workin' girls,"

Never mind.

thinkin' about stickin'
around for awhile.

Anything that
moves.

137
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:44,177
Nah, just doin' a little
drinkin', fishin' with
you,

this here guitar.

Man, can't never
could.

Look, the only way you gonna get
over this broad

Is by gettin' over on another
one.

That's the beautiful thing about
being single.

proper ass, take her
home,

159
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,686
Can I ask ya somethin'? Ya
ever thought about - leavin'?

160
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,756
And goin' where?
I dunno. Anywhere.

161
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,858
Nah, not really - why? I
dunno, sometimes I think

162
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:08,896
There's gotta be more to
it than just this.

163
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,102
It ain't
us. Huh?

164
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:20,373
It ain't us, man. Look, we
the "have nots." I'm not
trying to say I feel

165
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,175
Sorry for us, I'm just
sayin' we don't have the

166
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:25,178
Opportunity that most folks
have.

167
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:29,349
The only way we leave this
muthafucka is by joinin'
the Army or playin' ball.

168
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:33,186
Now the military ain't for
us

169
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,357
And basketball, shit, we
ain't get past high school.

170
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,328
What we do is, we stay on
our grind, play the hand we
was dealt

171
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:45,265
And try and get our dicks
wet along the way. It's like
our folks, man,

172
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:47,500
They was born and raised
here, they gonna die here.

173
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,903
What the fuck are you two
doing? What?

174
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:53,373
You were busy, we were
thirsty, so we helped
ourselves.

175
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:57,544
Man, get the fuck outta
here. So what you got over
there?

176
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:01,514
It's good. They all just
turned twenty-one.

177
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:05,518
At least that's what their
IDs say. Meaning they ain't
never been here before,

178
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:09,522
Meaning they don't have a
clue who we are. Dude, I've
been feeding them

179
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:13,493
Every girly-ass frou-frou
fruit drink I could think of,
ever since we opened.

180
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:17,497
Fuckin' tee-ball.
Nah-nah-nah, hey, just give
me a couple minutes, okay?

181
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,668
I think I'm making some headway
with one of 'em. Ya gotta
couple.

182
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:29,542
Hey, man, I'm sorry to
hear about you and Jess.

183
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,045
You know, I always kinda
thought she was cute, so -
I dunno,

184
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,047
If things don't work out between
her and Aaron, think maybe I
could-

185
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:36,216
Beers and shots, asshole.
Three of 'em.

186
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:40,653
And, no, the third one is not
for you, you insensitive
prick.

187
00:13:40,687 --> 00:13:41,989
I'd be careful, Kenny...

188
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:45,725
Joe's been known to spit
in people's drinks for less
than that.

189
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:53,666
Fuck a damn
bitch!

190
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,837
Fuck a damn
bitch!

191
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:01,841
Hey, why don't y'all go find
a table? I'll meet up with
you.

192
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,745
I thought you were going
to give me a couple
minutes?

193
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,883
After that Jess shit? Fuck
no, pal. You're lucky I
don't throw ya a beatin'.

194
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:13,987
What a ho. Yeah, but ya
know what? It's got me
thinkin'.

195
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:17,857
About what, getting a blood
test? No, well, yeah now. But
more than that,

196
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:22,029
You know, about what's next.
I mean, she's right. I can't
do what I've been doin' forever.

197
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:26,033
What are you thinking? I
dunno. Just sorta weighin' my
options right now,

198
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:30,003
I guess. But enough about
that, how're you doing? How's
work?

199
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:33,040
Work's work - same old
drunks, just a different day.

200
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,508
You know, Kenny and I've been
meanin' to come down there...

201
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,078
Yeah, yeah. I'll believe it when
I see it.

202
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,981
Only been tending bar down there
for two years. Corey, mark my
words.

203
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,516
I'm comin' down. It's
alright.

204
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,086
Ain't really the
place for you to meet nice
girls anyway.

205
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:50,190
You know your brother, ya
think he gives a shit about
that?

206
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:54,061
I was talking about you,
Bubbs.

207
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:58,065
Yeah, well, you work
down there, don't ya?

208
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:02,102
So, uh, how's Hayes?
Y'all still doin' okay?

209
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:06,173
Yeah, I guess. Some days
are good. Some days, less
than.

210
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:10,077
Sounds like a
blast.

211
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:18,151
So where is he tonight?
Staying in. When Kenny
called,

212
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:22,155
"We gotta do somethin',
shit." That's good, I like
that.

213
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:26,093
So, not having a locked
locale was reason enough for
Hayes to bail.

214
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,234
You sure about
that?

215
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:38,171
Excuse
me.

216
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:42,209
"Didn't think I was going to
be here?"

217
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:46,313
That's your excuse? You believe
that? I-I don't...

218
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:50,017
Corey, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa...
Yeah, "whoa," you crazy
goddamn bitch!

219
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,853
Hey! Man, this shit don't even
concern you, Bubbs. Yeah? Well
it does now.

220
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:57,890
Enough! Corey, calm
down!

221
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:01,928
Hayes, get the fuck outta
here!

222
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,999
These are mine now,
bitch. Let's go.

223
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:18,145
I want to go
home. C'mon.

224
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:25,152
What about Kenny? So ya like
chicken and beer and gettin'
your ass spanked?

225
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,086
I think I'm in
love.

226
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,971
You know, I'm kinda
surprised by ya, actually.

227
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,908
You know, comin' up, ya never
put up with no one's shit, so I
dunno. Neither do I.

228
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:52,979
Least ya threw your keys at
him.

229
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,983
Shut up. That's all I
could find.

230
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:01,188
Thanks for sticking up for
me, though.

231
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:05,092
So ya gonna be alright
tonight?

232
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:09,296
Ya know, with... He won't
come home tonight.

233
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:13,133
Okay. Well I
better... What?

234
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:17,237
Go, I guess? Ya just
said... That he won't be

235
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,308
Home
tonight.

236
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:25,178
So, what do you want to
do?

237
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:29,149
Right now? There's a pretty
big difference between

238
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:37,990
What I wanna do and maybe
what I should do.

239

[Music]

241
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:31,738
So why'd you ask me when I was
leavin' the other day? Ah, I was
just bustin' your balls.

242
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:35,808
C'mon now,
Bubbs...

243
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,077
Jess dumped me 'cause she
said I wasn't goin' nowhere.

244
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,812
Thing is, I've always been
curious

245
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:44,016
About leavin'. I just never
really considered it an option.
Thinkin' about it now?

246
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,987
A little, yeah. Son, if you're
hesitant because of your Mama
I'm gonna shit.

247
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,124
You're too old...
Hey-hey-hey, you dunno
my situation.

248
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:55,995
'Sides, ain't that. There's a
girl. A girl? Find one of those
anywhere.

249
00:19:56,028 --> 00:20:00,132
Not like this one. Look,
Bubbs, chasin' tail is fun.

250
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,502
Hell, it's one a my
favorite pastimes.

251
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,970
But we're talkin' about
your life here.

252
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:08,140
You know, ya only get one
shot at this,

253
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:09,342
Well, less ya believe in
reincarnation and then ya

254
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,144
Can take your sweet-ass
time.

255
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:16,115
But if ya got dreams, ya go
after 'em. Don't let some
skirt hold ya back.

256
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:20,152
That's the thing. She
ain't just "some skirt,"
Frank.

257
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:24,056
She's what I've compared
girls to my whole life. It's
complicated.

258
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,127
This "complication" gotta
name? Yeah, Corey

259
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,131
And she's gotta
boyfriend. Speed bump,
what else?

260
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:36,235
Ya know my friend Kenny?
It's his sister.

261
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:40,373
Interesting,
and?

262
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:44,377
And, uh, I sorta slept with
her. [Laughs]

263
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:48,548
You "sorta slept with
her?" Shit, son,

264
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:52,452
You remind me more of
myself every-goddamn-day.

265
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:56,456
So what do I do? Well it
ain't brain surgery. You
gotta let her know.

266
00:20:56,489 --> 00:21:00,560
Ask her out. Clear up any
confusion ya got quicker
than antibiotics

267
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,531
On a burnin' case of the
clap.

268
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:08,601
And what do I say to her?
Well, now that's kinda tough
to say.

269
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,236
A woman can be in any
assortment a moods,

270
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,672
But - tell ya somethin'
that's worked for me

271
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:16,676
From time to time. I just
say, "I can't wait to see
you."

272
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:20,613
"I can't wait to see you?"
How many a those you had
today?

273
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:24,784
That's even tougher to
say.

[Music]

275
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:32,725
We need to talk about
this.

276
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,663
Hayes - hello? Damn
it. Told you, Corey

277
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:40,767
Boy ain't no
good. Don't
start.

278
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,771
Hey, what are you doing here?
Told ya I'd come down, didn't
I?

279
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:48,274
I guess you did. Well can I
get you something?

280
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,242
Yeah-yeah, a beer'd be
great.

281
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,845
Bubbs, this is Mr.
Brownlee. Mr.
Brownlee, Bubbs.

282
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:56,883
How ya doin', sir? The
hell kind of name is
"Bubbs?"

283
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,957
Hey, is there someplace we can
talk? Yeah, sure.

284
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:17,003
Look, I dunno what the
situation's like between
you and Hayes,

285
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:20,973
But the other
night

286
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:24,110
I thought there might of
been somethin' there.

287
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:25,378
And I just wanted to see if
ya maybe wanted to go out

288
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:27,947
With me or somethin'
sometime.

289
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,750
Bubbs - I had a good time
with you too.

290
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,985
But Hayes and I've been
together for a long time

291
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:37,023
And it's just, that I
don't... It's cool.

292
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:41,027
I just had to ask. I'll,
uh, see ya around, alright?

293
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,164
Wait, you don't have
to... I got - somewhere
to be.

294
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,135
Hey, you going to finish
that?

295
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:53,105
Huh? No, it's all
you.

296
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:57,109
Him I
like.

299
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:16,763
Have you been going down there?
What? Where did you get these?
Did he give them to you?

300
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:20,767
Why ya goin' through my stuff?
Answer me! No, they're not
from him, alright? Jesus!

301
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,937
But what if they
were?

302
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:28,775
Why would that be so bad? I
don't want him hurting you
the way he

303
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:32,879
Hurt me and you know that.
That was a long time ago,
Ma. Maybe he's changed.

304
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:36,849
People like that don't
change. Frank is a selfish
old man

305
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:40,920
Who doesn't give a damn about
anybody but himself. Well, did
ya ever think that maybe...

306
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:44,924
Bubbs, he started
something that he couldn't
finish

307
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:48,928
A family. He left us,
your Grandmother and I to

308
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:52,965
Fend for ourselves. And for
what? So he could run
around

309
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:56,936
And have a good time? His
life is not one worth living.

310
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:01,140
Yeah, how do you
know? I'm sorry?

311
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:05,011
Look, Ma, I've been doin' some
thinkin' lately and...
[Phone ringing] And what?

312
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:09,015
[Phone rings again] Ya
gonna get that, or am I?

313
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:13,152
Just let the machine pick it
up. It's probably Corey
anyway.

314
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:17,156
What? She's been calling
here all afternoon. Now
what were you going to say?

315
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:21,193
What were you going to
say?!

316
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:25,097
Corey? How'd you know it
was me?

317
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:29,168
My Mama told me. What's goin'
on? I broke up with Hayes.

318
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:33,272
You did? Yeah. Why don't you
come over and I'll tell you
all about it.

319
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:37,176
Okay. Oh, hey,
Corey? Yeah, Bubbs?

320
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:41,514
I can't wait to see
you.

[Music]

323
00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,733
Hey, so if you liked me, why'd
ya turn me down?

324
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:05,237
Oh, I don't
know. Maybe it's the fact that
you're my brother's best friend.

325
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:09,341
Or that until a couple days
ago, my unblemished record
of never

326
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:13,412
Cheating on a boyfriend was
blown out of the water. Well,
when ya put it like that...

327
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:17,416
You know we got to tell
Kenny, right?

328
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,453
Yeah, but lemme do it,
alright?

329
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:25,457
Wonder how he's going to take
it? How did Hayes?

330
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:29,461
Not so well. A lot of
yelling, screaming.

331
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:33,432
Been together a long time,
you know?

332
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:37,570
Do you know why I like
you?

333
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:41,473
You're not like him.
You're calm, rational...

334
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:45,477
Well
hung...

335
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:49,582
Bubbs, I'm serious. You
think things out and I
appreciate that.

336
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:53,753
With him it was - not like
that.

337
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:57,590
He never

338
00:25:57,624 --> 00:26:01,761
Did anything, did
he?

339
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:09,736
No.

340
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:17,844
Whatever, bitch - next
week!

341
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:21,648
Hey, so how'd it go the other
night with ol' girl? Anna -
great.

342
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:25,918
I'll spare ya the details,
but fried chicken and a
paddle was involved.

343
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:29,989
[Laughs]

344
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:34,026
You're rememberin' their
names now. I'm impressed. Ya
gonna call her?

345
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,064
Hey, I remembered her name,
but let's not talkin' crazy,
alright?

346
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,565
Kenny, what happens when you run
outta girls around here?

347
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,134
Man, we'll burn that bridge
when we come across it,
brotha.

348
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:46,138
What about you? You boned
out

349
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:50,309
Pretty quick last night,
thought you found
somethin' yourself.

350
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:54,280
Bubbs, did you do
somethin' last night?

351
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:58,317
Ya know you can tell me if ya
went hoggin'. Everybody gotta
ham-bone or two in they closet.

352
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,321
I didn't go
hoggin'. So what's
up, man?

353
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:06,392
That night at the
bar

354
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:10,462
I ended up givin' your sister
a ride home.

355
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:14,333
So? So when we got there,
things happened,

356
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:18,437
We were both in a weird
place and, well - we sorta
got together.

357
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,408
What the fuck does that
mean?

358
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:26,578
That we did - like
that.

359
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:30,416
I'll understand ya wanna take
a shot at me.

360

361
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:51,270
[Music]

362
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:55,241
Maybe they're spank
books. Uh-oh.

363
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:59,411
What do you think? Who
knows? Could have some of
those

364
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:00,947
National Geographic pictures
in there.

365
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,415
You know, with the ones
hanging down to their
knees.

366
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:07,386
[Laughs] Mary, it could
be anything.

367
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:11,390
It could be a hobby, a
collection or just something
he interested in.

368
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:15,427
Kenny interested in anything
like this? If it ain't got tits
or basketball,

369
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,563
Kenny ain't gonna read
it.

370
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:19,398
Hey - don't confuse your
perversions for my son's,
alright?

371
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:23,469
Oh, I'm not, sir. You
see, I am an ass man

372
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:27,673
Who loves
NASCAR.

373
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,643
I'm just worried because
I think they're from
Frank.

374
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:34,713
Well what does Bubbs
say? That they're not.

375
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:36,515
But I don't know that I believe
him.

376
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,618
Well maybe I'm stating the
obvious, but have you
tried talking

377
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:43,790
To Frank about this? She ain't
talked to him in over twenty
years, numnuts.

378
00:28:43,823 --> 00:28:47,894
Why would she start now?
It's true. Well
everything except

379
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:51,898
For the "numnuts" thing.
Well call Grant. He's
down there,

380
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:54,834
He knows what's going on.
Might be able to clear things
up.

381
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:57,003
You all know what I do in
stressful times like these.

382
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,906
And I will be outside if you
want to join me.

383
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:03,876
Right out there.
Mary-Mary-Mary, now you've
come too far

384
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,880
To be taking to the ass-
backwards advice of that
clown.

385
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:11,884
Here, chew on these you get
the itch. They helped me.

386
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,490
You mean, like for
tourists?

387
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:23,930
Yeah, those came
out of the Salvation Army
box.

388
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:27,066
What? Yeah, the donation box
here in my office. People put
all kinds of stuff in there.

389
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,802
Sometimes Bubbs digs through
it, he takes what he wants.

390
00:29:29,836 --> 00:29:32,071
You know, been pulling books
out of there for awhile.

391
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:36,108
Really? And you're sure
that there's no way

392
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:40,212
That Frank could've...
Mary-Mary, I know every
single person

393
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:44,116
Who's put anything into that
box and I guarantee you
Frank is not one of 'em.

394
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:48,254
Well, okay. Thanks,
Grant. Sorry to bother
you.

395
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:52,391
Alright, alright,
goodbye.

396
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:56,395
What was it that I
explicitly asked

397
00:29:56,428 --> 00:30:00,266
You not to get me involved
in? What?

398
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:04,403
"What?" That was your Mom on the
phone. Grant, look, man,
that's...

399
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:08,374
Don't "Grant look" me. Whatever
it is you're doing... Man, I'm
not even doing anything!

400
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:12,544
I don't care. Stop doing
it.

401
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:16,448
Fine. We done here? No,
we're not "done here."

402
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:20,586
Payday.
Thanks.

403
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:25,591
Buy yourself some decent
britches. I'm sick of

404
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:28,660
Looking at the crack of your
ass everyday.

405
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:32,731
You don't see the crack of
my ass everyday, do ya?

406
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:43,409
[Music]

407
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:48,047
So, how's the little lady?
Good. Shame I can't say
the same for her brother.

408
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,118
Ah, give him time. He'll come
around. Yeah, I hope so.

409
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:56,222
Hey, can I ask you
somethin'? What do you think
about her bein' -

410
00:30:56,255 --> 00:31:00,292
Black? Not a
damn thing.

411
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:04,196
Ah, some folks may get their
panties in a pinch about
that shit, but not me.

412
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,200
I've courted many a woman. They
came in every shape, shade,
size

413
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:12,972
Not to mention position.
Ya know what really
matters?

414
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:17,209
And this's all that does, is
what you think about her. Well I
think she's great.

415
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:21,113
Well fuck everybody else. Ya
love her? Shit, Frank, I dunno.

416
00:31:21,147 --> 00:31:25,051
Oh, yeah, ya do. Ya like
bein' with her? You miss her
when she's gone?

417
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:29,755
You dream about her at
night? Sure, I guess.

418
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:41,934
Well let her know for Christ's
sakes. Yeah, but, Frank, man,
the girls these days...

419
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:43,869
Besides, what's the worst that
could happen? She don't say it
back.

420
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,972
Yeah, but at least you'll know.
Me, I tell everybody I love 'em.

421
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:50,576
That's 'cause you're normally
all fucked up.

422
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:54,446
Touché. You ever tell my Mama
you loved her?

423
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,051
A long time
ago.

424
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:03,522
It was my birthday and her and
her Mom saved up to get me
this gift.

425
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:07,559
What was it? Ah, don't
matter. I left the next
day.

426
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:11,863
Wasn't cut out to be no
father. Told your Grandmama
that,

427
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:16,268
She thought I'd change. And
sure I'd try, leave, come
back, try again.

428
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:20,872
But the sea was my first love
and just kept callin' me
back.

429
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:24,810
You ever think about tryin'
to make things right?

430
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:29,048
Everyday. Then
why don't ya?

431
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:33,019
Nah, it's just too
late.

432
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:36,955
Could always try. I mean,
what's the worst that
could happen, right?

433
00:32:42,428 --> 00:32:46,465
Outta every guy in this fuckin'
town, you gotta go and pick him?
Yeah, why not?

434
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:50,402
First of all he's, well, you
know... What, white?

435
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:58,477
Well, yeah.
He is
white.

436
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,448
[Laughs] Ha-ha-ha,
muthafucka. Keep it up and
you might be missin' a few.

437
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:06,585
That ain't even what this is
about though, is it? What
happened to Hayes, huh?

438
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:08,787
You just up and dump a brotha
because Bubbs all of a sudden
gets single?

439
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,456
You and Daddy never
even liked Hayes!

440
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:14,560
Neither did
I. I'm done.

441
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:18,564
What does it matter who
I'm with anyway?

442
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:22,701
We grew up with the kid. It's
just-it's just fuckin' awkward.
"Awkward?"

443
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:26,705
No, there's got to be more to
it. He's my best friend, Corey.

444
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,576
For the past couple years,
he's been tied up with that
bitch.

445
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:34,713
You know how it is when you
with someone - your friends
are your friends,

446
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:38,617
But they ain't at the same
time. Now I finally got my
boy back,

447
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,588
My road dog, my partner in
crime and my own sister
yanks him off the streets again.

448
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:46,725
It's like I never had a
chance. I'm not going to keep
him away from you

449
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:50,629
If that's what you're worried
about. It's not the same.

450
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:54,866
This isn't just some fling.
We like each other and I
think we always have.

451
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,737
What? It ain't like
either of us knew. And if
we had,

452
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,506
We wouldn't have done
anything out of respect for
you.

453
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,841
But times change, things
happen

454
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,845
And for some reason this
makes sense - at least to us.

455
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:11,016
In fact, it should to you
too. The fuck it should.

456
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,953
Kenny, I'm on your side, I
know how y'all are and I ain't
trying to change that.

457
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:18,924
What other girl would even
know where to start with you
two?

458
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:22,961
She's right, you
know? Sorry, now I'm
done.

459
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:31,203
Thanks.

460
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:35,207
So I heard you been talkin' to
Grant. I was worried, okay?

461
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:39,345
I'm sorry. I mean, between
you and Jess breaking up and
Frank

462
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:43,282
Coming back, it's been a
difficult time. Everything's
fine, Ma. Really.

463
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:51,357
I've been seein' someone.
Been a couple of weeks now.

464
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:55,361
What?
Who?
Corey

465
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:59,431
Jim's
girl.

466
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:03,535
What? You sure know how
to keep

467
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:07,439
Things interesting, I'll give
you that. This's real, Ma.

468
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:11,577
I'm
sorry.

469
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:15,447
Are you happy? 'Cause, you
know, that's all that matters.

470
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:19,451
I am,
actually.

471
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:23,522
Well then so am
I.

472
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:27,626
Oh, I think this belongs to
you.

473
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:37,669
[Knocks]

474
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:41,840
What the hell do
you... Oh.

475
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:47,112
When you and Jess split, I
thought we'd finally move

476
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,015
Out and get that place we
talked about.

477
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:53,885
You know, pimp it out, throw
some barbecue, pull box like
we rented us a U-haul.

478
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:57,923
Just got bummed I didn't get
to bring it up

479
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:01,860
Before you moved onto my
sister - no pun intended.

480
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:05,997
I had no idea,
man How could
you?

481
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:10,068
So hit me with it. How long's it
been like this? Long time.

482
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:14,039
And you never felt like sayin'
shit? The hell was I supposed to
say?

483
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:16,275
"Kenny, ya know your sister
I've grown up with my whole
life?

484
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:18,244
Yeah, well, I think she's
hot."

485
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:22,113
Was that so bad?
Yeah, man, it
was.

486
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:26,184
Pussy. Bubbs, if you liked
her, you should have told me.

487
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:30,121
I might not have been tryin' to
hear it, but I would've
listened. And then what?

488
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,590
I'd a gotten over it. Lord
knows I like ya a helluva

489
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:34,260
Lot better than that morose
muthafucka Hayes.

490
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:38,196
It's more than that,
Ken.

491
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:46,338
I think I love
her.

492
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:50,242
Ya know what? I can dig
it. Yeah?

493
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:54,246
Yep. Now tell me about this
thing at the bar a couple
weeks back,

494
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,350
When you was axin' about
leavin' and shit. What the
hell was that?

495
00:36:58,384 --> 00:37:02,421
Nothin'. Didn't sound
like nothin'.

496
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:06,425
It was nothin', man. Good.
'Cause if you with Corey,

497
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:10,329
Then you with her. Ain't
no half-assin' this.

498
00:37:10,362 --> 00:37:14,433
Ya do her wrong, ya fuck her
over, you're doin' the same
to us.

499
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:16,201
And speakin' of us, we still
gotta kick it.

500
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,504
I don't want
ya pullin' that disappearin'
act

501
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:22,441
Like you did with Jess,
alright? Alright.

502
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:26,512
So we
cool?
Yeah...

503
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:34,152
Long as ya pass that shit
back.

504
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:38,256
[Thunder]

505
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:42,260
Frank, how's it going,
buddy?

506
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:46,332
Hey, what're
those?

507
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:50,268
Ah, somethin' from
Millie.

508
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:54,239
Somethin' goin' on with you and
Miss Jenkins? That Millie's last
name?

509
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:58,276
Shit, no wonder Rob don't
like me callin' her "hot
pants."

510
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:06,418
You know they're engaged,
right?

511
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:10,656
Yeah -
yeah...

512
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,764
Bubbs, you know I've never been
missed? What?

513
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:22,768
To my recollection,
nobody's ever missed me.

514
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:26,938
Feelin' sorry for
yourself? No-no,

515
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:30,842
I just - forget
it.

516
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:34,913
Hey, you sure ya
wanna... [Bang... crash]

517
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:39,050
Jesus Christ. Maybe that's the
answer, Bubbs. Think he misses
me?

518
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:42,988
I doubt it. Oh
well. His loss.

519
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:51,096
Bubbs, you ever wonder how
similar folks can be so
different all at the same time?

520
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:56,702
Frank, I think ya need to go to
bed. No-no-no, I'm tryin' to
talk to ya here, son.

521
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:04,710
Well now take you and me
for example.

522
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:08,680
We alike in a lot a
ways, except for our
luck.

523
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:12,851
You, you've always been
luckier in love.

524
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:16,822
Ya got friends and family
that care about you, lady on
your arm to boot.

525
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:20,826
Me? I've been with more
women than I care to
remember,

526
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:28,867
But can't forget all the time
I spent alone.

527
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:36,808
Have been lucky in life,
though. While you were
stuck here,

528
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:40,979
I've danced and drank,
ate, O.D.'d,

529
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:44,983
Cheated death and taxes, I've
run from the law, gone
straight and run again.

530
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,091
Seen shit so scary you can
crap your shorts and sights so
beautiful,

531
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:57,062
It'd make you wanna
cry.

532
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:05,203
Kicker is, we're both
intrigued by the other.

533
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,140
Which makes me think that
the answer's

534
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:13,144
A little bit a
both.

535
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:21,352
You know, Bubbs, you can
see everything in the
world,

536
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:25,356
But if you ain't got nobody
to share it with

537
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,294
It just ain't worth a
helluva lot,

538
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:33,298
Ya know? It
just...

539
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:37,335
It just ain't worth
a...

540
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:41,306
Just ain't worth a
helluva lot...

541
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:45,310
Just
ain't...

542
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:53,418
[Music]

543
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,588
Been down here awhile, huh?
Yeah, you know,

544
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:59,457
Grant gave me my first
job when I was fourteen,

545
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:03,629
Been workin' for him ever
since.

546
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:07,533
Ever think about what's
next? Ya mean like job-wise?

547
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,635
Yeah, that, or living with your
Mama-wise. That's what this's
about, isn't it?

548
00:41:09,668 --> 00:41:11,202
I bet she still does your
laundry, huh?

549
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:15,541
Yeah, but only 'cause she does
such a kick-ass job. I mean,
smell this.

550
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:19,745
Please, I'd rather
not.

551
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:23,715
So is it financial or
something? No, I got a little
tucked away.

552
00:41:23,749 --> 00:41:27,819
Then what? It's Ma. She -
she needs me.

553
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:35,827
She's been left by
everyone she's ever cared
about.

554
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:37,796
Frank left when she was little,
her older sister passed in
grade school,

555
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,865
Followed by her
Mama a little later

556
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:43,869
And to top it all off, my
piece a shit father ran off to
Pensacola

557
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:47,873
To be with some waitress. I
just can't do it to her is
all.

558
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:51,977
I'm only talking about
moving out of the house,
Bubbs.

559
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,914
Yeah, but what if I'm
not?

560
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:59,951
What?

561
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:03,889
Ever since I was little I'd
come down here and watch
the boats

562
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:07,993
Take off, just wishin' I was
on one of 'em.

563
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:11,897
Didn't matter where it was
goin', just as long as it
was leavin'.

564
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:16,034
You still think like
that? Yeah - don't you?

565
00:42:16,067 --> 00:42:20,038
No.
Really?

566
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:24,042
You've never thought about
gettin' out, seein'
someplace new?

567
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:28,213
You're fine workin' in that bar
every night, gettin' shit tips
if y? It's not perfect, but it's
work.

568
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:32,217
And that's a lot more than
some can say.

569
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:36,154
Besides, what would I
do someplace else?

570
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:40,158
Anything ya want,
Corey.

571
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:50,235
[Music]

572
00:42:50,235 --> 00:43:00,245
[Music]

573
00:43:57,235 --> 00:44:01,172
Christ!

574
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:05,176
[Knocking]

575
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:13,318
Lock the door behind you.
Jesus. The hell happened
in here?

576
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:17,622
Hey, you
okay?

577
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,625
Corey, what - what
happened?

578
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:24,796
He was here when I got
home. Who was?

579
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:29,801
Hayes. Hayes was here?
Tonight? Lemme see that.

580
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,774
Tell me what
happened. Bubbs, I...

581
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:38,276
Tell me!

582
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:42,981
He used the spare key to
get in. He'd been drinking
and wanted to talk

583
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:47,652
And try and patch things up. I
told him I was with you now
and he flipped.

584
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,989
And what, he hit
you?

585
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:54,960
Oh, that motherfucker...
Bubbs, no! That's not what
I want.

586
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:59,664
I don't really give a shit right
now, alright?! Well you should
if you want to stay with me.

587
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:03,201
There's a reason I'm with you
and not him. Corey, I am not
about to let this slide.

588
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:08,206
Bubbs, I want to be with you,
but you do this and we're
done.

589
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:28,593
Should help you learn the
guitar. Think I saw some
ol' Waylon in there too.

590
00:45:28,626 --> 00:45:31,629
What's all these scribbles and
shit? Ah, got it used.

591
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,198
Thanks, Bubbs. I appreciate
it.

592
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,767
Frank, what if somethin'
happened to somebody ya cared
about

593
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:37,535
And it wasn't somethin' that
should be gotten away with,

594
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,705
But the person it happened to
didn't want ya to do nothin'
about it.

595
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:44,810
Wouldn't ya do it anyway? If
this's about me, I'm lost.

596
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:48,814
Corey's old boyfriend got drunk
and-roughed her up. Jesus.

597
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:52,784
Yeah. Thing is, she don't
want me doin' nothin' about
it,

598
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:55,787
Includin' tellin' her
brother. Why the hell not?

599
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:56,788
I dunno. Says she's with
me 'cause I'm not like him

600
00:45:56,822 --> 00:45:59,791
And that it's over and I
should just let it be.

601
00:45:59,825 --> 00:46:01,159
Maybe ya should? How can I?

602
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:04,930
This fuckin' guy can't deal,
gets bombed, beats her up and
it's okay?

603
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:08,867
And what kinda boyfriend does
that make me? One that listens?

604
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,969
Please... Bubbs, it comes
down to three things -

605
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:15,273
What your head says, what
your heart says and what your
gut says.

606
00:46:15,306 --> 00:46:17,075
Well my head says to go along
'cause I don't wanna lose
her.

607
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,110
My heart doesn't say
shit, it just hurts.

608
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:23,982
And my gut - says to beat his
goddamn ass. Well if ya want
things to stay the same,

609
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:28,954
You better listen to your
head. And what do you say?

610
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:30,088
You know, I've been in fights
all my life.

611
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:33,024
Whether I woke
up with a busted fist or a
busted face,

612
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:37,128
I can't remember anything
ever turnin' out for the
better.

613
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:41,132
But, on the other hand, in
my experience, folks usually
get what's comin' to 'em.

614
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:45,036
I say go and talk to this
guy,

615
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,038
Tell him the only reason
you're not sendin' his teeth

616
00:46:47,072 --> 00:46:49,174
Down his throat is 'cause she
asked ya not to,

617
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:53,211
But there ain't gonna be
a "next time." If he
can't understand that?

618
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:57,082
Then you listen to your
gut.

619
00:47:17,302 --> 00:47:21,272
I need to talk to
you.

620
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:25,376
Go
Inside.

621
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,413
Look, I know,
alright?

622
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:29,814
And the only reason I ain't
fuckin' you up right now is

623
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,183
'Cause she begged me not
to.

624
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:37,522
But I hear you've been
anywhere near her? It's on.

625
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:40,926
Reason you ain't doing
shit, ain't 'cause of
Corey,

626
00:47:40,959 --> 00:47:47,165
It's 'cause you a
bitch. Just stay away
from her, asshole.

627
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,434
Ain't like it's the first
time.

628
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:53,638
But I'm sure she told you
all about that, right?

629
00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:17,929
And that's the truth. And
that's why I don't cook
bacon naked no more.

630
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:22,000
And yet another reason why
never to eat breakfast
with Gary.

631
00:48:22,033 --> 00:48:26,137
I can show you the scar, if you
want, right here. Noooo!!

632
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:30,075
What the hell happened to
you? Oh - work.

633
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:34,079
Hey, what can we get you,
sweetheart? Nothing. I need to
talk to Bubbs

634
00:48:34,112 --> 00:48:38,183
Right now -
outside.

635
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:42,253
Oh, you're in trouble
now... Ow.

636
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:46,124
Don't. Dawn called and told
me everything.

637
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:48,226
He's an asshole, alright? He's
had it comin'. If it wasn't me,
it'd.

638
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:50,195
Then why not let them do
it?

639
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:54,332
Because I care about you,
that's why. What he did-I
had to.

640
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:57,268
You didn't... Yes,
Corey, I did!

641
00:48:57,302 --> 00:48:59,304
Even after promising me you
wouldn't?

642
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:01,372
Hey, I had every intention a
just talkin' to him. That was

643
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:02,407
Until I found out the truth.

644
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,311
I was trying to protect
you. From what?!

645
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:10,415
Bubbs, stuff like that can mess
with your head. I could a
handled it.

646
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:12,517
I also didn't want you thinking
differently about me. Like I was
broken or something.

647
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,419
The only thing makin' me think
differently's the fact ya
lied.

648
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:18,523
Guess that makes us even
then.

649
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:22,527
Corey, he needed to know that
shit was wrong and now he
does.

650
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,062
If not for you, for every
other girl that dickhead
dates.

651
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:26,397
I'm glad I did it and
I'd fuckin' do it again.

652
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:30,401
Do you know why I liked
you?

653
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:34,572
It's because I thought you
were different. Different than
most guys around here

654
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:38,609
And definitely different than
Hayes. But I guess I was
wrong.

655
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:48,686
[Music]

656
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:55,126
[Music]

657
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,130
You know, just look at it
like this-now you're free to
meet someone new.

658
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:03,234
Yeah, I guess you're
right.

659
00:50:03,268 --> 00:50:07,172
Oh, no-no-no, it's on
me.

660
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:11,276
You know, Jess, ever since
high school I always kinda...

661
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:15,180
Beer, Joe...
and a shot.

662
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:27,625
So...
One sec.

663
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:39,737
Rough day?

664
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:43,741
What do you care?

665
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:47,612
Corey and I had a fight. I
think we might be breakin'
up, actually.

666
00:50:47,645 --> 00:50:51,749
Must be something going
around.

667
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:55,886
So did Aaron and I.
Really? What
happened?

668
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,890
Well you were
right.

669
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:03,928
He ain't moving to
Tampa.

670
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:07,965
He said he just liked the way I
shook my... Yeah, yeah, I got it.

671
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:12,002
But mostly, he said that
folks like he and I don't
stay together.

672
00:51:12,036 --> 00:51:15,940
Folks like
who?

673
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:20,010
Folks like him, with money, and
folks like... Us?

674
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:23,981
That rich fuckin' bitch. Ya
know, just 'cause we ain't
got what he's got,

675
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:28,052
He thinks he can judge us?
Fuck him. You're better off.

676
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,989
You said,
"Us." Huh?

677
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:36,093
You said, "Us." Is that
still how you think of you
and me?

678
00:51:36,127 --> 00:51:39,997
I dunno, Jess, it just came
out.

679
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:44,101
I know I don't want
anyone doin' ya wrong,
though.

680
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:48,173
Even after?

681
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:52,143
Even after.

682
00:51:56,247 --> 00:52:00,318
Fuck that! You should a told
me. I thought I could handle
it.

683
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:04,555
You thought? Corey, I'm your
brother. How can I help you
if I don't know?

684
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:06,557
I'm sorry, Kenny. Know what?
You can't be mad at Bubbs no
more.

685
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:07,892
Like hell I can't. That's what
relationships are all about.

686
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:10,595
If someone asks you not to do
something,

687
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,630
You don't say you won't,
then turn around and do it
anyway.

688
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:15,600
Hey, all I know, he done what
any guy, in his shoes, would
a done.

689
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,269
That's the problem. I don't
want a guy like that.

690
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,671
I want a guy that can use his
head for a change.

691
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:24,709
Yeah, well, good luck
findin' that.

692
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:28,879
You know what I
mean. Well I disagree.

693
00:52:28,913 --> 00:52:32,750
You do, huh? Well lemme axe
you somethin', why didn't you
tell me?

694
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:36,921
I don't know. Sure you do.
'Cause I'd a done the same
fuckin' thing and you know this.

695
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:41,058
So if you're mad at him, you
have to be mad at me too. Why?

696
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:45,062
Why is that always the answer
with you guys? I don't know,
Corey, it just is.

697
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:49,099
A muthafucka does somethin'
like that, gotta heap a
shitty karma comin' their way

698
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:53,103
And I'm glad somebody
fuckin' gave it to him. Just
mad I ain't get my licks in.

699
00:52:53,137 --> 00:52:57,208
Unbelievable.

700
00:52:57,242 --> 00:52:58,809
Look, I appreciate what you
sayin',

701
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:01,212
But you have to
understand where he's
comin' from.

702
00:53:01,246 --> 00:53:05,250
He found out someone hurt
his girl, the one he grew up
his whole life with,

703
00:53:05,283 --> 00:53:09,287
The one he's been crushin'
on forever,

704
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,291
But had to keep it a secret,
the one that knows every
embarrassin' thing about him,

705
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:17,262
But still wants to kick
it.

706
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:21,266
The one he loves.

707
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:25,403
What?

708
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:29,440
It's true. He told me.
Where do you think he
is?

709
00:53:33,478 --> 00:53:37,548
What're ya doin'? I wanted to
talk to you without Joe all
hovering around.

710
00:53:37,582 --> 00:53:41,486
So ya come into the
guy's shitter?

711
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,556
I've missed you,
Bubbs.

712
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:49,660
Jess... Look, this ain't the
drinks talking, so just hear
me out, alright?

713
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:53,698
I've said some terrible
things and I'm sorry.

714
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:56,801
It's not where you are,
it's where you're going.

715
00:53:56,834 --> 00:53:58,369
And when you get to where
you're going,

716
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:01,739
You'll have done it all by
yourself, which is a hell of
a lot more

717
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:05,876
Than Aaron can say. This
whole experience

718
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,880
Has put things into
perspective for me and - I
want you back.

719
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:13,884
Look, Jess, I appreciate
ya sayin' all this, I do,

720
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:18,155
But I'm with Corey now. Ya
know that.

721
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:22,293
Are you, Bubbs? I mean,
don't you think it's kinda
funny

722
00:54:22,327 --> 00:54:26,431
Us both ending up here
tonight? These kinda things
happen for a reason, you know.

723
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:30,468
It's a small town. Let's not
read too much into it,
alright?

724
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,337
You can't tell me that it
wouldn't be nice to be with

725
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,439
Somebody that understands
right now.

726
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:38,443
No, I mean, yeah.

727
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:42,580
It would, I guess.

728
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:46,717
Well who understands
better than us?

729
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:50,721
I mean, we know what we
like and we know what we
don't.

730
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:56,727
I say we start with right
now and take it from there.

731
00:55:00,731 --> 00:55:04,869
Where is he? Actually,
he's right there.

732
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:08,873
Corey-Corey,
wait!

733
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:12,877
Wait-wait-wait...

734
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:16,280
Will ya just stop? That wasn't
what it... What? It looked like?

735
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:20,284
You know what? It's fine.
Whatever happened in there,
can stay in there,

736
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,520
'Cause we weren't going to work
out anyway. Corey, wait.
Look-look...

737
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:24,989
This whole thing was doomed
from the beginning.

738
00:55:25,022 --> 00:55:28,926
So let's just chalk it up
to what it is, a mistake,

739
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:33,063
And stop wasting each other's
time. You are not a waste of my
time.

740
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:36,300
We're two completely
different people, Bubbs.
Let's face it, we're not a
good fit.

741
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,968
How can you say that? After
after everything?

742
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:41,205
We want different things
and that's never going to
change.

743
00:55:41,238 --> 00:55:45,242
Like what?! What're you
even talkin' about?

744
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:49,079
Leaving, Bubbs. That's what
I'm talking about.

745
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:53,183
Corey, that was just talk.
I got no plans to do
nothin'.

746
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:57,187
Yeah, for right now. But what
about next month? Or six
months from now? Or next year?

747
00:55:57,221 --> 00:56:01,191
That's not something I'm
thinking about 'cause I'm in
no position to do it.

748
00:56:01,225 --> 00:56:05,362
Corey -
Corey...

749
00:56:09,233 --> 00:56:13,538
I love you.

750
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:17,442
I know.

751
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:21,646
These kind of things happen
for a reason.

752
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:27,217
Jess - fuck off.

753
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:31,388
Postcards? Nope, don't know
nothing about no postcards.
You're sure?

754
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:35,359
Maybe if I come down there and
show you... Mary-Mary, they did
not come from here, honey. Okay?

755
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:39,530
Okay -
thanks.

756
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:55,680
Kenny, look,
man...

757
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:58,182
What the fuck I tell ya?!
Man, it ain't what it
fucking looks like!

758
00:56:58,215 --> 00:57:03,387
You wanna get beat?! Keep
lyin'! I thought I laid it out
pretty clear, did I not?!

759
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,692
Kenny, I... Shut up! I told
you - you fuck over her,

760
00:57:07,725 --> 00:57:11,729
You fuckin' over us. Well, you
done fucked up. You done broke
every rule in the goddamn book.

761
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:15,866
Made me choose sides! My
advice to you?

762
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,804
You thought about leavin'
once, do it again. 'Cause me
and Corey?

763
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:23,841
We done with ya. Now get the
fuck off my lawn.

764
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,216
Already told ya, boy. Think
my ramblin' days are done.

765
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:36,386
Why now all of a
sudden?

766
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,290
I'm seventy years old. I'd
hardly call that "all of a
sudden." What's goin' on anyway?

767
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:44,394
Next time you were thinkin'
about takin' off, I wanted
to go with ya.

768
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:48,432
What about your
lady? It's a long
story.

769
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,367
Listened to your gut,
huh? Yeah, and then some.

770
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,436
Well, I never vouched for
listenin' to your bowels.

771
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,405
They don't do nothin'
but talk shit.

772
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:57,441
What's the matter with this
place, Bubbs?

773
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,377
They don't call it the
"Sunshine State" for
nothin'.

774
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:04,515
I'm just tired of wakin' up
to the same ol' shit, ya know?
Of never seein' nothin' new,

775
00:58:04,549 --> 00:58:08,385
Of hopin' one day it'll all be
different. Nah, told ya, Bubbs,

776
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:12,523
I'm through with all that.
Much's I hate to admit it,
I'm gettin' on up there.

777
00:58:12,557 --> 00:58:16,594
Frank, you said you could
see everything in the world,

778
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:20,531
But it didn't mean nothin'
if you couldn't share it
with somebody.

779
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:22,132
I said that? Must a been
bombed outta my gourd.

780
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:25,469
Point bein', share it with me. I
mean, I know that sounds weird,
but let's do it.

781
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,839
Grandfather,
Grandson, one big trip.

782
00:58:28,873 --> 00:58:32,910
Yeah, I dunno... Look, it's
hard growin' up with a single
Mom, alright?

783
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:36,914
I mean, they try, but they can't
teach ya everything. And that's
wh. Me?

784
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:40,851
Yeah, ya taught me how to
cuss and grill a steak, how
to sail this boat

785
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:42,987
And throw a punch, how to
change my own oil

786
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,022
And a thousand other
things every guy should
know.

787
00:58:45,055 --> 00:58:47,024
I wasn't around that
much.

788
00:58:47,057 --> 00:58:53,163
Yeah, but it was still a
hundred percent more than
my father.

789
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:54,164
Look, I just want ya to know
that I appreciate it

790
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:57,001
And I was hopin' we could
do some more of that.

791
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:01,171
What's your Mama say about
that? Nothin'. Ain't told her
yet.

792
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:02,840
Well I'm sorry, son, but this
conversation's over 'til ya do.

793
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:05,342
But, Frank, man, you don't
understand...

794
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,343
Listen, Bubbs, we both know
that she don't even like ya
down here.

795
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,213
Much less talkin'
about this kinda shit.

796
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:13,350
Now I'm not sayin' I won't
think about it, but not 'til
ya talk to her.

797
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:17,387
And that's somethin' I
just can't do.

798
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:21,391
Ma, I need to talk to you
about something.

799
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:25,329
What are these? They're from
him, aren't they?

800
00:59:25,362 --> 00:59:29,433
Yeah, but it's not what you
think. There are no "but's." We
are talking about this.

801
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:33,370
I'm leavin', Ma. With him.
What? What about Corey and
work?

802
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:37,407
We broke up and - it's
time.

803
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:41,779
But you promised... I
never promised, alright?

804
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:45,850
I'm stuck here. I need to know
what's out there. I've been...
No.

805
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:49,854
Whatcha mean, "No?" I am your
mother and I'm saying "No."
You can't go.

806
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:53,824
Well I'm tellin' you I
am.

807
00:59:53,858 --> 00:59:58,162
You don't know him like I know
him. You're right, I know him
better.

808
00:59:58,195 --> 01:00:02,199
He will leave everything,
including you, if the
situation gets a little too...

809
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:05,369
He wouldn't do that to me.
Trust me, he would.

810
01:00:05,402 --> 01:00:06,503
His is not the sort
of life worth living.

811
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:10,507
Yeah, well, at least he lives
his. Excuse me?

812
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,609
Mama, you've been burned,
alright? I get that.

813
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:14,679
But ya stopped livin'
your life because of
it.

814
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:18,849
You're afraid of lettin'
anyone in or out 'cause of
what might happen.

815
01:00:18,883 --> 01:00:22,853
And you can't forgive Frank for
somethin' that happened over
twenty! He left, Bubbs! It's...

816
01:00:22,887 --> 01:00:26,891
Unforgivable, I know.
Especially if ya never give
the man a chance.

817
01:00:26,924 --> 01:00:30,995
How dare
you?

818
01:00:31,028 --> 01:00:34,164
'Cause you need to hear
it, alright? Ya know why I
stuck around this long?

819
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:35,599
It's 'cause I felt sorry for
ya.

820
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,169
I was worried what you
might do if I left, but now
I don't care.

821
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:43,007
I'm leavin' and I just
wanted you to know.

822
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:07,264
Woman, Rob's gonna find out
we keep up this sorta
schedule.

823
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:11,335
I can see you ain't changed
a bit.

824
01:01:11,368 --> 01:01:15,372
Surprised you still got
that.

825
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:19,443
Why wouldn't I? My
daughter gave it to me.

826
01:01:19,476 --> 01:01:23,313
Yeah, well, listen, I just
came down here to say one
thing

827
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:27,484
And then I'll let you get
back to doing, whatever it is
that you do.

828
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:31,655
Tell Bubbs he can't
go. Listen, Mary, I...

829
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:35,592
Save it. I don't care what
you tell him, as long as he
stays.

830
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:39,596
Look, Mary... I ain't
asking, Frank.

831
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:43,768
Why do you think he comes
down here?

832
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:47,772
Because he's lookin' for
somethin'. Somethin'
bigger than himself,

833
01:01:47,805 --> 01:01:51,675
Bigger than this town - bigger
than us. How do you know?

834
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:55,312
Look where he works. Here in
this Marina where folks come
and go everyday.

835
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:56,180
So why talk
to me?

836
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:59,917
I've been asking myself
that for years.

837
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:04,021
It's because I've lived my
life different than everybody,
Mary.

838
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:07,992
He's unhappy, but he won't
do nothin' about it because
he's afraid of hurtin' you.

839
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:11,996
No he ain't. He told me
today he is leaving with
you.

840
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:16,033
Well I haven't said a
word. Like hell you
didn't!

841
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:20,204
Mary, you had to've seen
this comin'. It was
inevitable.

842
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:24,174
Not until you came
along. Giving him
postcards

843
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:28,078
And filling his head with
God knows what, undermining
everything that I have done.

844
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:36,253
Why? Didn't hurt me enough,
so you gotta go through my
son?

845
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:40,357
All I have ever done is
tried to show him there's
more out there than just this!

846
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:44,394
What is wrong with
"this?" "This"is his
home.

847
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:48,365
"This" is stiflin' him,
Mary! You're stiflin' him!

848
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:52,302
I'm sorry? You're
holdin' him back!

849
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:56,306
By keeping what's left of this
family together? No, by God, by
not lettin' go!

850
01:02:56,340 --> 01:03:00,310
He is all I
have.

851
01:03:00,344 --> 01:03:04,314
Mary, what are you so afraid
of?

852
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:08,352
Him turning into
you.

853
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:12,356
A selfish son of a bitch
that's run from anything
resembling a responsibility,

854
01:03:12,389 --> 01:03:16,493
His whole
life.

855
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:20,497
Someone who didn't know a
good thing when he had it

856
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:24,534
And someone because he's
lived alone is going to die
alone.

857
01:03:28,672 --> 01:03:32,809
Now, Frank, if you've
ever thought about us,

858
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:36,813
If you've ever cared at
all,

859
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:40,851
You'll do this for me now and
you will tell Bubbs he can't
go.

860
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:57,067
Oh, c'mon, Millie, you
think I'm some kind of a
fool?

861
01:03:57,101 --> 01:04:01,138
I know what kind of undershorts
I wear... and these ain't
them!

862
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:05,309
Son of a
bitch!

863
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:21,291
Didn't realize Frank
started wearin' draw's.

864
01:04:21,325 --> 01:04:25,395
He doesn't. It was a
gift.

865
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:29,466
Guess you can't teach old dogs
new tricks. Guess not.

866
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:39,543
[Music]

867
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:49,553
[Music]

868
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:16,806
I don't know why he came
back, I really don't.

869
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,944
At least he picked a
different slip that son of a
bitch.

870
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:24,848
I'm telling you, Millie, if I
even see him around... Rob...

871
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:29,019
You're lucky I love you
so much.'Cause other
guys...

872
01:06:29,053 --> 01:06:32,889
Can we talk about this
outside, please?

873
01:06:41,098 --> 01:06:45,135
Hey, Frank, I need to talk
to you.

874
01:06:45,169 --> 01:06:49,173
Look, Grant, before ya say
anything, I got in a beef
with Rob and Millie,

875
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:53,177
I saw a couple empty slips
back here, so I decided to
just move my boat around.

876
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:55,845
Ain't what I'm here about,
Frank. Rent due already? Shit,
what month is this?

877
01:06:55,879 --> 01:06:59,283
Normally, Frank, I wouldn't give
a shit. You know, a guy like
you,

878
01:06:59,316 --> 01:07:01,118
Every February you pay your
slip fees for the year,

879
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:05,322
You pay in cash. Whatever it
is you do, you do it well
enough,

880
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:09,359
Where I ain't gotta hear
about it.

881
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:10,460
Now aside from a dumpster
full of beer cans and

882
01:07:10,494 --> 01:07:13,297
Some neighborly infidelity
and a daughter

883
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:17,367
Who bugs the shit out of me
every time she thinks
you're corrupting her son,

884
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:21,505
You're just about the best
tenant I ever had, Frank.
Listen, Mary and I...

885
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:25,475
I'm talking. It's not just
about Mary. It's about
Bubbs, too.

886
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:29,613
Whether you like it or not,
you're a part of their lives,
Frank. You ain't got the right...

887
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:33,550
Yeah - I
do.

888
01:07:33,583 --> 01:07:37,687
You get right with them, both
of them, Frank. Or I'll kick
you out of my Marina for good.

889
01:07:41,825 --> 01:07:45,695
Alright, have a nice
day.

890
01:07:57,741 --> 01:08:01,845
Mind if I sit
down? No, have a
seat.

891
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:18,662
Know anything about some
Nicotine Patches being left
on my porch?

892
01:08:18,695 --> 01:08:22,766
Outside the fact that you
ain't using them? No.

893
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:26,770
Miss you around the store.
Yeah, been busy. Gary
giving you a hard time?

894
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:30,940
No, actually, without you
there to bust him on crap,

895
01:08:30,974 --> 01:08:34,944
He's regressed to saying nothing
at all. Well maybe I should stay
away then.

896
01:08:34,978 --> 01:08:38,815
Well I wish to hell
you wouldn't.

897
01:08:43,086 --> 01:08:47,157
Hey,
Kenny.

898
01:08:47,191 --> 01:08:51,195
I'm a holler at you
later, alright?

899
01:08:51,228 --> 01:08:55,031
Yeah, it's a shame about
them. How's he holding up?

900
01:08:55,064 --> 01:08:59,269
I don't know. I've been
finding all sorts of stuff in
his room.

901
01:08:59,303 --> 01:09:03,307
Just today I found an ad for
a job, in Key West,

902
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:07,344
With a start date of less
than two weeks away.

903
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:11,381
I don't want to tell you
your business, Mary,

904
01:09:11,415 --> 01:09:15,452
But snooping around the
boy's room? It ain't right.

905
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:19,489
He won't talk to me. It's the
only way I know what's going
on.

906
01:09:19,523 --> 01:09:23,493
Well that's just the way
guys are. Believe it or not,

907
01:09:23,527 --> 01:09:27,497
We do have dome things
brewing up here.

908
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:31,935
Most of the time we work it
out on our own. But it's those
things that we actually say,

909
01:09:31,968 --> 01:09:36,105
If we decide to say them,
that you should be paying
attention to.

910
01:09:36,139 --> 01:09:40,043
I'm just worried. Before
people leave,

911
01:09:40,076 --> 01:09:44,113
They give off this cold,
distant feeling like
they're severing ties with you.

912
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:48,318
Frank did it, Bubbs's father
did it and now Bubbs is
doing it.

913
01:09:52,456 --> 01:09:56,526
Mary, these kids can't
stay under our roof
forever.

914
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,464
We do the best we can, with
what we got, then we turn
'em loose.

915
01:10:00,497 --> 01:10:04,534
But they come back, they
always do.

916
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:08,605
That's why they call it
home.

917
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:12,609
Now see, you might think
that once he leaves,

918
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:16,713
You're gonna be all alone,
but that ain't the case.

919
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:20,750
I have, and I always will,
be right across the street.

920
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:28,958
I'll talk to you
later. Hayes - bye.
Bye.

921
01:10:28,992 --> 01:10:32,962
Shut up. Did I say
anything?

922
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:37,000
No, but I could feel your
look.

923
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:40,937
Damn, Corey, this place's
off the chain!

924
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:44,874
Don't like it? Go somewhere
else. Easy. I'm just fuckin'
around.

925
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:52,916
Kenny, over the past two
years I've been here, you've
never come down once.

926
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:55,552
Now, over the past month,
you've been here nearly every
night,

927
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:57,153
Bitching, whining and
not tipping worth a damn.

928
01:10:57,186 --> 01:11:01,157
The fuck are you talkin'
about? He never tips!

929
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:05,194
Don't worry about him. He
came with the bar.

930
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:09,265
Hate to say it, but
you're getting on our
nerves.

931
01:11:09,299 --> 01:11:13,269
"Our" nerves? First of all,
Corey, we family.

932
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:17,073
We supposed to get on
each other's goddamn
nerves.

933
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,508
And second, I'm just tryin' to
help you out.

934
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:22,846
You know, bring
some young clientele in here.
Maybe turn this bitch out.

935
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:26,916
We think you're
hiding. "We" -

936
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:29,285
What? From
who?

937
01:11:29,319 --> 01:11:33,357
Hey, I can give a shit
about him, alright?

938
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:37,461
Look, I'm just tryin' to be
a good brother and help you
out in your time of need.

939
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:40,196
Look, I appreciate you being
here in my "time of need,"

940
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:41,598
But we both know this ain't
where you want to be.

941
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:45,602
Bubbs is your boy and y'all
go back before I can
remember.

942
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,572
And it'd be pretty stupid to
throw that away because of

943
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:49,739
Something that happened
between he and I.

944
01:11:49,773 --> 01:11:53,743
He did ya wrong,
Corey.

945
01:11:53,777 --> 01:11:57,747
He's also your family
too.

946
01:11:57,781 --> 01:12:01,751
And it's like you said, "We
supposed to get on your
goddamn nerves."

947
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:17,734
I'm going to kick your ass,
Frank! Alright, but no pullin'
hair this time.

948
01:12:17,767 --> 01:12:21,805
Stay away from my Millie,
fucker! Eat shit, jackass!

949
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:25,809
Alright-alright,
alright-alright, break it up.
Break it up. Pussy!

950
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:29,779
I am what I eat. Rob, stop!
Jesus, man, go home! Go home!

951
01:12:29,813 --> 01:12:33,850
What're you doin'? Fixin'
to give him a lesson

952
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:37,921
In street-fightin'. Ya know
that sissy tried to bite
me?

953
01:12:37,954 --> 01:12:41,925
See ya around, Frank.
Look-look, Bubbs. Listen,
I wanted to apologize.

954
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:45,328
For what? Not havin' the
balls to tell me "no" to my
face?

955
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,330
Look, son, I know you're...
I'm not your goddamn son,
alright?

956
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,332
And I ain't mad,
I'm pissed.

957
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,000
Here I was talkin' to ya like
ya gave a damn only to get

958
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:53,336
Shit on like some kinda
fuckin' chump.

959
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,338
And what about Millie, huh?
I dunno what lines ya fed
her,

960
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:57,340
But ya had her wrapped
around your finger.

961
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,342
But did you have the decency
to be straight up with either
of us?

962
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:02,178
No, ya just left in the
night like a little bitch.

963
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:06,115
Ya know, Mama was give a
damn about yourself.

964
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:10,186
Listen, you don't know every
goddamn-thing. I had reasons for
I doin' what I did.

965
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:14,123
Oh, yeah? What are
they? That's what I
thought.

966
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:18,294
Look, I never meant to
hurt you, boy. You're the
only friend that I-

967
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:21,364
Friend? Ya know what friends
are, Frank? They're
reliable.

968
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:22,799
They're there when ya need
'em, they'll tell ya the truth

969
01:13:22,832 --> 01:13:25,735
When no one else will, you can
confide in 'em

970
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:26,970
And they won't use that shit
against ya.

971
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:30,406
But you've never
been that to anybody, old
man, so fuck off!

972
01:13:50,694 --> 01:13:54,731
[Knocks]

973
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:58,735
What's going
on...

974
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:02,606
So how's
your...

975
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:06,810
Fine. You always hit like
a bitch.

976
01:14:06,843 --> 01:14:10,814
Dropped yo' ass, didn't
I?

977
01:14:10,847 --> 01:14:14,818
My bad, man. Shit happens
everyday and Lord knows I
ain't no saint.

978
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:18,822
Nah, man, it's my fault. I
had a great thing going and I
fucked it up.

979
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:22,959
Yeah, but I turned my back
on ya without hearin' you
out.

980
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:27,063
Ain't no need for
that.

981
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:30,266
Look, we go back since we
were terrorizin' the block on
big wheels

982
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:31,434
Sharin' yours,
at least.

983
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:35,004
And not for nothin', but
you and Corey made sense to
me.

984
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:39,242
Yeah?

985
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:43,246
I ain't blind. You two'd
go from zero to sixty

986
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:44,614
The second the other one
walks in the room.

987
01:14:44,648 --> 01:14:47,150
Why ya think I brought her
out that night?

988
01:14:47,183 --> 01:14:51,420
What? Bubbs, for as long as
I known you, you always been
lookin'

989
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:55,258
Off someplace else. Without
Jess, I thought you might
act on it.

990
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:59,395
It depressed
me,

991
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:03,299
So I told Corey to meet us
out that evenin'.

992
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:07,436
Figured, if she can't distract
you, no one could. But she was
with Hayes...

993
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:11,440
Any time away from that
muthafucka, is time well
spent.

994
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:19,549
What were you tryin' to
do?

995
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:23,486
Cheer you up, get your mind
off whatever it was on.

996
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,557
Didn't think what
happened would happen,
but it did

997
01:15:27,591 --> 01:15:31,661
And I'm glad it did - if
only for a minute.

998
01:15:31,695 --> 01:15:38,735
Appreciate that,
man.

999
01:15:38,768 --> 01:15:42,739
So when you takin'
off?

1000
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:44,741
It's
time.

1001
01:15:44,774 --> 01:15:51,581
You know it, I know it, we
all fuckin' know it.

1002
01:15:51,615 --> 01:15:52,248
Got nothin' holdin' you back
no more.

1003
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:55,785
Just do whatcha gotta,
man,

1004
01:15:55,819 --> 01:16:00,156
And tell us all about it
when you get back.

1005
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:04,560
We'll be here for
you.

1006
01:16:04,594 --> 01:16:08,598
Yeah, I'm callin' about
the deckhand position.

1007
01:16:08,632 --> 01:16:12,568
Thanks.

1008
01:16:12,602 --> 01:16:16,706
Double or nothing. One
week. She smokes, I lose,
you win.

1009
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:20,710
That is, if you're game.
Okay. But as long as you
promise not to leave us again.

1010
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:24,714
I promise.

1011
01:16:24,748 --> 01:16:28,985
Okay, that's fine. But that just
means the chili dog train won't
be slowing down no time soon.

1012
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:32,956
A chugga-chugga-chugga -
all aboard!

1013
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:36,960
All aboard the chili dog
train.

1014
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:40,930
Can I get a minute,
fellas?

1015
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:44,934
It's alright,
guys.

1016
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:52,976
Be right outside you need
us.

1017
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:05,121
I need to talk to him,
Mary.

1018
01:17:05,154 --> 01:17:09,225
Why don't you? Ain't like you
ever asked before. I tried, he
won't see me.

1019
01:17:09,258 --> 01:17:12,595
Shocking. Mary, I'm asking
for your help here.

1020
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,098
What have you ever done to...
Look, I didn't know how much he
meant, to me,

1021
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,200
'Til I couldn't
see him no more, alright?

1022
01:17:17,233 --> 01:17:20,603
Why Bubbs? I mean, how'd
you guys even meet?

1023
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:24,073
Better yet, out of all the
places that you could've
gone,

1024
01:17:24,107 --> 01:17:25,374
Why'd you come back
here?

1025
01:17:25,408 --> 01:17:29,378
There was a time I wasn't
doin' too good.

1026
01:17:29,412 --> 01:17:33,382
Money was a mess, I'd run
my old lady off,

1027
01:17:33,416 --> 01:17:37,420
Government was up my ass
about some shit.

1028
01:17:37,453 --> 01:17:41,424
I was drinkin' a helluva
lot more than I am now.

1029
01:17:41,457 --> 01:17:45,528
Was thinkin' some really
awful thoughts.

1030
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:49,465
I came back here because
this's the only place I
considered home.

1031
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:53,469
Not because I knew it as
such, but because you did.

1032
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:57,540
I didn't really have a
plan, just thought

1033
01:17:57,573 --> 01:18:01,644
We might run into each other
by osmosis, or who knows?

1034
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:05,614
Anyway,

1035
01:18:05,648 --> 01:18:09,719
One day I'm nursin' a
nasty hangover,

1036
01:18:09,753 --> 01:18:13,823
When I see this kid fishin'
off the dock by my boat.

1037
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:17,693
Couldn't have been more
than ten, twelve. Just
sittin' there, starin' off.

1038
01:18:17,727 --> 01:18:21,697
He sees me, asks me what
I'm lookin' at.

1039
01:18:21,731 --> 01:18:25,802
I told him nothin', ask
him where his Daddy was.

1040
01:18:25,835 --> 01:18:29,906
He says he didn't know, but his
Mama worked up at the Canoe
Shop

1041
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:33,910
Name's Mary Wilson, ya know
her?

1042
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:37,881
I told him not
really.

1043
01:18:37,914 --> 01:18:41,918
Well he sizes me up, tells
me his name's Bubbs,

1044
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:46,189
Asks would I like to fish
with him. I told him sure.

1045
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:50,293
Every time I come back in,
we'd find each other and do
just exactly that.

1046
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:58,267
He saved me from a really
bad place, Mary.

1047
01:18:58,301 --> 01:19:02,271
When did you tell him about
me? Oh, early on.

1048
01:19:02,305 --> 01:19:06,209
Just thought he should
know. Mary, I'm gettin'
old.

1049
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:10,379
I'm tired of doin' what I done
'cause I ain't got shit to
show for it.

1050
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:14,383
And I just wanna get things
right - before it's too
late.

1051
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:17,720
You
ain't...

1052
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:20,223
Oh, no-no. I'm talkin' about the
boy.

1053
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:22,358
You know, you said you're
afraid he's gonna turn out like
me.

1054
01:19:22,391 --> 01:19:26,562
Well I'm tellin' ya that,
that ain't gonna happen,
Mary, and you know why?

1055
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:30,433
'Cause he's got
you.

1056
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:34,537
The kid's head's on
straight.

1057
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:38,574
No amount of talkin' I do,
is gonna change that.

1058
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:42,545
I mean, not that I was
tryin' or nothin'.

1059
01:19:42,578 --> 01:19:46,715
So you talk, huh? What does
he say?

1060
01:19:46,749 --> 01:19:50,686
Ordinary stuff. Questions
mostly. He's just tryin' to
get a wrangle on things,

1061
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:54,858
Like the rest of us. I will
say this, though

1062
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:58,862
Keepin' up with him's been
good,

1063
01:19:58,895 --> 01:20:02,866
Because it's let me keep up with
you too. What would you want to
do that for?

1064
01:20:02,899 --> 01:20:06,970
You're,
uh,

1065
01:20:07,003 --> 01:20:10,907
You're still my daughter,
Mary.

1066
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:20,183
I've been a pain in the ass
lately. Bubbs...

1067
01:20:20,216 --> 01:20:21,684
Been tryin' to figure
somethings out and

1068
01:20:21,717 --> 01:20:23,119
I've been takin' it out
on you and I'm sorry.

1069
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:27,223
It's okay.

1070
01:20:27,256 --> 01:20:31,360
I'm unhappy, Ma. Have been
for awhile.

1071
01:20:31,394 --> 01:20:35,231
Now it ain't you and it
ain't Frank and it ain't
Corey

1072
01:20:35,264 --> 01:20:39,302
It's me. I'm rottin'
here.

1073
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:43,272
This town, everything. I need
a change.

1074
01:20:43,306 --> 01:20:47,376
You have something in
mind?

1075
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:55,518
It's for a deckhand job on a
private fishin' boat. They
take folks out, show 'em around.

1076
01:20:55,551 --> 01:20:59,422
They go all
over.

1077
01:20:59,455 --> 01:21:03,559
I called and they said if
I want it, job's mine.

1078
01:21:03,592 --> 01:21:07,563
So what's the
problem?

1079
01:21:07,596 --> 01:21:11,534
They run outta the Keys and
I'd have to report next
week.

1080
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:15,571
Listen, Bubbs, I've been
a hypocrite.

1081
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:19,742
For years I've been telling
you how selfish Frank is

1082
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:23,679
When I've been guilty of
worse.

1083
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:27,850
Ma, no, he left just like
you said he would.

1084
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:31,720
Only 'cause I asked him
to.

1085
01:21:31,754 --> 01:21:35,791
What?

1086
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:39,862
I thought he was a bad
influence. That he was
the reason for everything.

1087
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:43,732
But I was
wrong.

1088
01:21:43,766 --> 01:21:47,770
You are your own person and
you are stronger than that.

1089
01:21:47,803 --> 01:21:51,774
It's me that's, you
know... Ma - Ma, don't -
don't...

1090
01:21:55,878 --> 01:22:00,016
I just thought if you
stayed, everything would be
okay.

1091
01:22:00,049 --> 01:22:04,053
Well that worked for me,
but not for you.

1092
01:22:04,087 --> 01:22:07,890
It's unfair for you to have
to deal with my past.

1093
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:12,028
I mean, that's something I
need to come to terms with.

1094
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:15,931
And, you know, you have always
had that wandering spirit,
just like your Grandfather.

1095
01:22:15,965 --> 01:22:20,069
You needed something from
him that I just couldn't
give you

1096
01:22:20,103 --> 01:22:24,107
And you know
what?

1097
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:28,177
I'm glad you found each
other. Seems like it's done
you both some good.

1098
01:22:28,211 --> 01:22:32,281
So what I'm trying to
say...

1099
01:22:32,315 --> 01:22:36,185
Is if this is something
that you need to do

1100
01:22:36,219 --> 01:22:40,289
I'm fine with it.

1101
01:22:40,323 --> 01:22:47,363
But I need you to do
something for me first.

1102
01:22:47,396 --> 01:22:48,231
Takin' off?

1103
01:22:48,264 --> 01:22:52,335
Nah - just cleanin'.

1104
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:56,339
Packed this ol' girl to
the gills over the years.

1105
01:22:56,372 --> 01:23:00,376
Ain't gettin' rid of that, are
ya? No-no.

1106
01:23:00,409 --> 01:23:04,380
Matter of fact, I cracked
that book you gave me.

1107
01:23:04,413 --> 01:23:09,952
Listen to this. I've been
practicin'. [Guitar Strums]

1108
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,488
The hell was that?

1109
01:23:12,521 --> 01:23:16,559
"Mommas Don't Let Your
Babies Grow Up To Be
Cowboys."

1110
01:23:16,592 --> 01:23:20,529
Keep practicin'.

1111
01:23:20,563 --> 01:23:24,600
You know, y'all were right about
me. Frank, Mama told me...

1112
01:23:24,633 --> 01:23:26,502
Ah, that don't make any
difference. I am selfish, always
have been.

1113
01:23:26,535 --> 01:23:28,604
You know, at the end of the
day, it's how ya treated folks

1114
01:23:28,637 --> 01:23:32,608
That counts. Well I treated
'em like shit and it shows.

1115
01:23:32,641 --> 01:23:36,779
Bankin' on "better late
than never,"

1116
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:40,683
'Cause that's all I got
left.

1117
01:23:40,716 --> 01:23:44,653
I lived my life exactly how
I wanted.

1118
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:48,691
I've enjoyed the spoils
and there's been a few,

1119
01:23:48,724 --> 01:23:52,761
But I've also burned a lot
of bridges along the way.

1120
01:23:52,795 --> 01:23:56,732
The one I never intended to
burn was the one between me
and you.

1121
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,007
What makes us any
different?

1122
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:11,080
Ya kept me connected, ya
kept me engaged. Shoot, ya
kept me alive.

1123
01:24:11,114 --> 01:24:13,116
This may sound corny as
hell,

1124
01:24:13,149 --> 01:24:17,186
But ya reminded me of the
little

1125
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:22,125
Good I done here - your
Mama, which led to you.

1126
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:26,295
I thank ya for
that.

1127
01:24:26,329 --> 01:24:30,833
To show you my
appreciation, I'm givin' ya
my boat.

1128
01:24:30,866 --> 01:24:33,969
What? She's yours, son. You
deserve her.

1129
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:41,043
Frank, I-I-I can't take
this. This's your home.
This's what ya do.

1130
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:45,047
Nah, not anymore. I'm
retirin'.

1131
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:48,684
I got my stories,
son.

1132
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,853
You get
yours.

1133
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:03,031
Taking the deckhand job,
huh? Yeah, well I was, until
Frank gave me his boat.

1134
01:25:03,065 --> 01:25:07,170
Frank gave you his boat? Son
of a bitch.

1135
01:25:07,203 --> 01:25:11,140
Well, hell, I wouldn't take
the job either.

1136
01:25:11,174 --> 01:25:15,010
Hey, how'd you know about
that deckhand thing?

1137
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:19,047
Now who do you think I put
that up on the board for, huh?
Millie?

1138
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:23,219
And the
books?

1139
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:31,327
Why didn't ya ever say
nothin'?

1140
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,429
I just figured you'd get
there on your own time.

1141
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:38,434
Besides, if I said something,
would you have listened?
Probably not.

1142
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:43,339
Probably not. Grant, I just
want you to know I appreciate
it.

1143
01:25:43,372 --> 01:25:47,476
It was my pleasure. You
take care of yourself, huh?

1144
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:51,414
Alright, you
too.

1145
01:25:51,447 --> 01:25:57,986
We'll talk about this
later. Hayes - Hayes?

1146
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:59,655
What?

1147
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:05,394
Folks show you how they
are, Corey. Believe 'em.

1148
01:26:05,428 --> 01:26:07,763
What are you doing
here?

1149
01:26:07,796 --> 01:26:11,800
Wanted to say
goodbye.

1150
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:15,804
So tomorrow,
huh? Yeah...

1151
01:26:15,838 --> 01:26:22,811
Know where you're going? I
gotta couple ideas. Probably
decide in the mornin', though.

1152
01:26:22,845 --> 01:26:25,748
Know when you'll be
back?

1153
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:30,853
Yeah, I don't blame
you.

1154
01:26:30,886 --> 01:26:31,820
Corey, I just wanna say
that I'm...

1155
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:35,824
Bubbs - I know. Me
too.

See you on
board?

1166
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:56,064
Ooh, nicely
done... Easy, ol'
timer.

1167
01:28:56,098 --> 01:29:00,068
Alright, now times've
changed since the last time
you were behind the wheel,

1168
01:29:00,102 --> 01:29:01,904
So don't be stoppin' at every
bar along the way, alright?

1169
01:29:01,937 --> 01:29:04,306
Ain't had the truck two seconds
and you're already takin' all
the fun out.

1170
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:08,143
You do still have a valid
license, don't ya?
Alright-alright,

1171
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:12,280
I won't stop at any
bars.

1172
01:29:12,314 --> 01:29:18,787
Frank, man, I just want you to
know that... You're welcome, son.

1173
01:29:18,821 --> 01:29:20,222
And thank you.

1174
01:29:20,255 --> 01:29:24,393
Be good, huh?
You know I won't.
