1
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,660
And it came to pass after these things
that God tested Abraham...

2
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,140
..and said to him ''Abraham, ''...

3
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,540
..and Abraham said ''Here I am. ''

4
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,060
And God said...

5
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,380
.. ''Now take your son, your onIy son
whom you Iove, Isaac,...

6
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,260
..and go unto the Iand of Moriah
and offer him as a sacrifice...

7
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,900
..on a mountain that I wiII show you. ''

8
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,700
So, everyone,
what's reaIIy going on here?

9
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,620
(boy) It was a test of Abraham's faith
and devotion to God.

10
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,500
(teacher) Danny?

11
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,740
As usuaI you have something to add?

12
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,300
(Danny) It's not about his faith,
it's about God's power.

13
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,260
God says ''You know how powerfuI I am?''

14
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,580
''I can make you do anything I want,
no matter how stupid. ''

15
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,700
''Even kiII your own son. ''

16
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,620
''Because I'm everything
and you're nothing. ''

17
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,220
(train rumbIes)

18
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,300
- Hey, yeshiva bocher!
- What?

19
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,180
Get up!

20
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,300
Get the fuck up!

21
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,940
Where do you think this is?

22
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,780
Did you fuckin' trust?!

23
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,100
Your God's gonna provide a fuckin' ram
instead of you? No!

24
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,180
Do me a favour.

25
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,460
Why don't you fuckin' hit me, OK?

26
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,660
Hit me!

27
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,220
Hit me!

28
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,020
Hit me! Hit me! Fuckin' hit me!
Hit me, please!

29
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,300
- Fuckin' kike!
- (gasps and coughs)

30
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,780
It wiII no Ionger be true that the country
has a unified set of core beIiefs.

31
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,220
We wiII cease to be a nation
in the traditionaI sense...

32
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,380
..and become instead a confederation
of interest groups...

33
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,780
..Iike medievaI principaIities.

34
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,460
At the same time, we wiII fIow into
the anonymous sea of the gIobaI market.

35
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,380
The economic advantages are obvious,...

36
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,740
..but the cuIturaI, psychoIogicaI...

37
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,580
Where l grew up in South Boston,...

38
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,500
..when a kid walked down the street,
everybody knew his name.

39
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,740
He runs out in front of a car, someone says
''Jimmy Dunn, get back on that sidewalk...

40
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,940
..and you stay there!''

41
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,300
After high school, he sees his uncle
at the gas works or the shipyard,...

42
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,820
..he gets his apprenticeship.

43
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,780
Eight years later,
he's making $16.50 an hour,...

44
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,420
..he's got four kids,
he's playing ball and going from...

45
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,220
Today, that kid walks down the street,...

46
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,780
..it's filled with trash,
half the faces are black,...

47
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,340
..the shipyard's closed, only jobs left
at the gasworks are set-asides.

48
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,420
And by the time he drops out of high school,
he'd rather get a job at the Burger King.

49
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,660
So he drinks, does crack, whatever.

50
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,340
When he hangs himself at 23, the only
people mourning him are his buddies...

51
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,380
..and his mom.

52
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,780
The soul of this country...

53
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,740
..is being destroyed.

54
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,860
And the only thing this government
can offer us is free trade, mutual funds,...

55
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,700
..and lPOs.

56
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,460
The average man...

57
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,060
..is crushed less by accumulated wealth
than by lack of leadership,...

58
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,780
..lack of community,...

59
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,860
..culture,...

60
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,580
..and a sense of emptiness
he simply cannot fill on his own.

61
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,420
That's why l'm a fascist.

62
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,140
lt's the only form of government that
can address our fundamental needs.

63
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,580
What about race?

64
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,580
This isn't the time for that.

65
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,300
l disagree.

66
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,820
l think race is central to everything
we're talking about.

67
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,340
Spiritual life comes from race, the blood.
Without that, we're no better than the Jews.

68
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,140
What's wrong with the Jews?

69
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,340
Carla.

70
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,100
The point is,
the modern world is a Jewish disease.

71
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,900
- All right?
- What disease?

72
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,020
Abstraction.

73
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,500
They're obsessed with abstraction.

74
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,420
So what would you propose, then?

75
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,700
Killing Jews.

76
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,020
That would be a catastrophic mistake.

77
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,540
- People hate Jews, do you agree?
- They used to. Today that's not an issue.

78
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,980
No. No, no.

79
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,900
Deep down, beneath all the tolerance
they learn on television, nothing's changed.

80
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,980
The very word makes their skin crawl.

81
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,380
And it's not even hate.

82
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,020
lt's the way you feel when a rat runs
across the floor. You wanna step on it!

83
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,980
You just wanna crush it. You don't even
know why. lt's a physical reaction...

84
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,020
..and everyone feels it.

85
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:22,780
Jew.

86
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,580
Which ones would you kill?

87
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,500
- Barbra Streisand. Kissinger...
- (laughter)

88
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,100
- Don't let celebrity obscure the issue.
- Which is what?

89
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,620
At first no-one would know
why they were being killed.

90
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,380
You wouldn't announce it?

91
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,620
l'd say nothing.

92
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,740
And after one or two, people would try
to find a reason, an answer.

93
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,100
And when it comes out, there'll be outrage.
lt will look like Germany all over again.

94
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,980
lsn't that what we want?

95
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,100
Germany all over again,...

96
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,500
- ..only done right this time.
- (muttering)

97
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,180
And when people find out that rich,
successful, brilliant Jews are being killed,...

98
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,420
..they'll be glad.

99
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,140
And they won't say anything,
not even to themselves.

100
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:16,620
Once someone says it aloud, they'll think
''That's exactly what l was thinking.''

101
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,340
- (muttering)
- And it'll all spread from there.

102
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,820
lt always does.

103
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,740
You're not in school. What do you do?

104
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,300
Drive a forklift
over at the Big Boy warehouse in Queens.

105
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,100
(clears throat) Young man,...

106
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,060
Lina Moebius. And you are?

107
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,460
Daniel Balint.

108
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,300
Balint?

109
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,340
lt's German.

110
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:52,020
Are you with the FBl, Mr Balint,
or any other law-enforcement agency?

111
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,580
l was about to ask you the same thing.

112
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,020
So,...

113
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,980
..what are you really after, Daniel? Hm?

114
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,260
Do you wanna just kill Jews
or do you have something larger in mind?

115
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,380
Curtis thinks your ideas
would marginalise us.

116
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,540
Curtis, we're already marginal.

117
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,140
That's our appeal. We're saying
what no-one else has the guts to say.

118
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,260
Who would you kill first?

119
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,940
llio Manzetti.

120
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,860
Former ambassador to France,...

121
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,340
..managing partner
of Damon & Schwartzchild.

122
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,940
lt's an investment banking house.

123
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,740
- He's Jewish, Manzetti?
- Totally.

124
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,260
His parents emigrated from Bulgaria
when he was 1 1 .

125
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,420
How would you do this?

126
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,100
l'd need some time to assess his routines
and security,...

127
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,220
..but ideally, on a New York City street,...

128
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,660
..midday, with a small-calibre automatic
without a silencer.

129
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,460
Why no silencer?

130
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,980
Cos you want it to be an event.

131
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,260
Why don't you come visit us in the country?

132
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,780
We have a retreat.
You might find it interesting.

133
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,620
Bring your friends, if you like.

134
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,900
He reminds me of Karl, when l first met him.

135
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,540
l thought we agreed. Anti-Semitism is
exactly what we're trying to leave behind.

136
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,340
l mean, killing Manzetti(!)

137
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,140
Did you see how they reacted to him?

138
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,300
Of course, in this room, where people
aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis.

139
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,860
- lt's a romantic movement. lt always was.
- Lina,...

140
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,340
Look, l don't care about the Jews
one way or another. But it has a power.

141
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:40,660
The 1000-year Reich barely lasted a decade.
You really wanna go down that road again?

142
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,380
ln America, of all places? Order and
discipline aren't exactly the national virtues.

143
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,020
He's very bright.

144
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,460
He speaks well.

145
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,860
- So what do we do with him?
- ''Bring his friends''(!) We're not his friends.

146
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,780
Hey, Danny, you fuck the girl yet?

147
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,380
- l liked her mom.
- Her mom?!

148
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,060
(car horn blares)

149
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,980
(horn blares persistently)

150
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,940
- (long blast of horn)
- Fuck you!

151
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,860
Get the fuck out of the way!

152
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,140
- Fuckin' nigger!
- Why don't you fuckin' go back to Rwanda?

153
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,980
Shut up, motherfucker!

154
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,700
- Come on!
- (shouting)

155
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,020
(cries of pain)

156
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,620
(hums)

157
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,700
(man cries and moans)

158
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:45,380
- Like it in here?
- (distant voice) Shut the fuck up.

159
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,580
D'you ever read Mein Kampf?.

160
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,220
Hitler had some of his best ideas in prison.

161
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,980
- Daniel Balint.
- (keys jangle)

162
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,020
- Hey, shut the hell up!
- (man cries and moans)

163
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,980
Not going anywhere without them.

164
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,700
Can l use a credit card?

165
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,060
Be quiet. l don't wanna wake up my mother.

166
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,100
(pronounces badly) ''Und die Worte zerfieIen
in meinem Mund wie modrige...

167
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,980
..PiIser.

168
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,580
- PiIser?
- PiIze.

169
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,980
''And the words fell apart in my mouth
like mouldering mushrooms.''

170
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,500
(sighs)

171
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,420
A lot of these are in Spanish.

172
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,620
Yeah. My grandma's from Argentina.

173
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,020
My father's family went over during the war.

174
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,460
Where's your father now?

175
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,540
He's in a mental institution.

176
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,820
Was he a Nazi?

177
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,140
l don't know. We don't talk about that.

178
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,420
l don't think he cares about all that stuff
any more.

179
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,900
What's he care about?

180
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,100
Killing himself.

181
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,740
D'you think people ever commit suicide
out of happiness?

182
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,460
lt's stupid. Why would they do it
if they were happy?

183
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,340
You're not like the others, are you?

184
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,940
Like your friends.

185
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,180
Yes, l am.

186
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,620
Basically, l am.

187
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,660
Hurt me.

188
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,340
Just do it. Hurt me.

189
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,140
Ow! Not that hard!

190
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,260
Get up.

191
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,460
You have to go.

192
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,580
- What?
- (slaps)

193
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,580
(Lina) Curtis.

194
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,420
Bring the paper.

195
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,580
(door slams)

196
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,340
= Questa vita, non ha senso

197
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,260
= ImpossibiIe

198
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,420
Punk-ass!

199
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,820
= Questa vi... Questa vi...

200
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,380
= Questa vi... =

201
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,860
(woman's voice) Where d'you have it
last, Dad? Try to remember.

202
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,100
Sit down.

203
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,700
(TV) Thank you and congratuIations.

204
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,860
(teacher) ''..and offer him there
as a sacrifice...

205
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,060
..on a mountain that I wiII show you. ''

206
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,860
Everyone, what's reaIIy going on here?
ShIomo?

207
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,260
(boy) It was a test of Abraham's faith,
of his devotion to God.

208
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,900
Isaac wasn't his onIy son.
IshmaeI was his son, too.

209
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,740
- The onIy son he Ioved.
- Oh, they onIy kiII them if they Iove them(!)

210
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,420
Danny,
as usuaI you have something to add?

211
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,740
It's not about Abraham's faith.

212
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,740
It's about God's power.

213
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,340
God says ''You know how powerfuI I am?''

214
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,060
''I can make you do anything I want,
no matter how stupid. ''

215
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,180
''Even kiII your own son. ''

216
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,540
''Because I'm everything
and you're nothing. ''

217
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,140
OK, Danny, but if Hashem is everything
and we are nothing,...

218
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,180
..how then are we to judge His actions?

219
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,500
We have free wiII and inteIIigence,
which God aIIegedIy gave us.

220
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,740
What are you taIking about?
God never Iets Abraham kiII Isaac.

221
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,820
He gives him the ram
so he doesn't have to.

222
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,940
PersonaIIy, I think that's a Iie.

223
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,460
(teacher) You think? Based on what?

224
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,180
There's Midrash supporting it.
My father read a book by ShaIom SpiegeI,...

225
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,460
..that said Isaac died and was reborn.

226
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,300
No-one foIIows that Midrash.

227
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,260
I do! I foIIow it. But OK,
say God provided the ram. So what?

228
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,860
Once Abraham raised the knife,
it was as if he'd kiIIed him in his heart.

229
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,940
He couId never forget that
and neither couId Isaac.

230
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,300
He's traumatised.
He's a putz the rest of his Iife.

231
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,380
Danny, watch your Ianguage.

232
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,340
The whoIe Jewish peopIe were... (fades)

233
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,300
Danny! (she knocks on door)

234
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,980
(door opens)

235
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,940
(footsteps)

236
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,780
l knocked but you didn't hear me.

237
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,100
What are you doing?

238
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,020
He's gonna die.

239
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,100
He won't take his medicine and...

240
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,780
..he eats dairy. Probably still smokes
when l'm not around.

241
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,860
l asked him to move in with us.
lt was Alex's idea.

242
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,940
But he didn't wanna be any trouble.

243
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,060
Well,... then he couldn't be bitter
about living alone.

244
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,540
Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure?

245
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,140
Jesus Christ, Danny,
how can you wear that thing?

246
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,580
Linda, don't start.

247
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,900
Do you know what it means to your people?

248
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,700
- They're not my people.
- Yeah? Tell that to Hitler.

249
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,540
Oh, he decides?
Hitler's the chief rabbi now?

250
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,580
Why?

251
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,740
There's 50 reasons.

252
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,860
Even if you knew them all,
there'd be another 50 you didn't know.

253
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,660
Do you know them?

254
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,340
l made him some noodles. You can heat
them up and eat with him, if you want.

255
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,460
l can't. l gotta go.

256
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,300
You can heat them up and eat with him.

257
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,660
(sighs)

258
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,740
(father coughs)

259
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,980
(TV commentary)

260
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,380
lt's Friday.

261
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,540
Do l give a shit?

262
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,980
The Torah says you can't light a fire
on Shabbos cos it's work, correct?

263
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,140
Mm-hm.

264
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,420
But if alternating current is always running
through the wires and l turn a switch,...

265
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,460
..sending it here instead of there,
how is that lighting a fire?

266
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,340
Do chickens give milk?

267
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,340
Exactly.

268
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,100
(comedian on TV) The macho button
snapped back out...

269
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,820
Who's this?

270
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,300
lt's Denis Leary.

271
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,620
Funny?

272
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,620
Hm. Not like Uncle Mitch.

273
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,220
He was funny.

274
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,700
- Hello?
- DanieI BaIint?

275
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,900
Uh, this is Guy DanieIsen.

276
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,300
I'm a reporter and I'm doing a piece
on right-wing groups, post OkIahoma City.

277
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,980
A reporter for who?

278
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:41,380
Uh, Rolling Stone, Esquire, New York Times
and uh... I write for a Iot of pIaces.

279
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,380
- New York Times?
- Yeah.

280
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,620
Uh, Iisten.

281
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,220
- I hear you have a Iot of interesting ideas.
- Who toId you that?

282
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,020
Isn't it true?

283
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,700
(Danny) No.

284
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,980
Yeah. It's true.

285
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,860
How d'you get this number?

286
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,340
Danny.

287
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,420
- Hey. Guy Danielsen.
- You? You looked different at that meeting.

288
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,820
Well, you know...

289
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:11,460
So the other night, you said you thought
the modern world was a Jewish disease.

290
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,980
Can you elaborate on that a little bit?

291
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,740
Uh, in this racialist movement,
we believe there is a hierarchy of races.

292
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,580
You know, whites at the top,
blacks at the bottom,...

293
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,340
..Asians, Arabs, Latins,
somewhere in-between.

294
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,820
- Why are you writing if you're recording it?
- Helps me concentrate.

295
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,860
Uh, Danny,...

296
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,980
..what about the Jews?

297
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,100
Jews, Judaism,...

298
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,140
..it's like a sickness.

299
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,580
How is Judaism a sickness?

300
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,020
Take sexuality.

301
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,420
- Sexuality? What do you mean?
- Ever fuck a Jewish girl?

302
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,980
What?

303
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,900
Did you ever fuck one?

304
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,740
Well, yeah, l mean, l've been out with a...

305
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,500
There you go. What did you notice?

306
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,860
Like what?

307
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,340
Jewish girls love to give head.

308
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,860
Right?

309
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,180
- Yeah, sure.
- And Jewish men love to get it.

310
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,340
Everybody likes to get it.

311
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,780
Yes, it's very pleasurable, but Jews are
obsessed with it. You wanna know why?

312
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,740
Yes. Why?

313
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,700
Because a Jew's essentially female.

314
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,780
- Female.
- Yeah. Real men,...

315
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,900
..white, Christian men,...

316
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,620
..we fuck a woman.
We make her come with our cocks!

317
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,260
But a Jew doesn't like to penetrate and
thrust. He can't assert himself in that way,...

318
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,660
..so he resorts to these perversions.

319
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,100
Oral sex is technically a perversion,
you know that, right?

320
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,140
- Yeah.
- So after a woman's had a Jewish man,...

321
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,620
..she's ruined. She never wants to be
with a normal partner again.

322
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,940
So the Jew's a better lover?

323
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,140
He's not better. That's not what l said.

324
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,740
l said he gives pleasure.
That's actually a weakness.

325
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:08,900
All right, so it's not that the Jew runs
the media, or that he owns all the banks,...

326
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,340
Look, the Jews clearly control the media
and the banks.

327
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,940
lnvestment banks, not the commercial ones,
but the point is,...

328
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:20,340
..they carry out in those realms the exact
same principles they display in sexuality.

329
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,620
They undermine traditional life
and they deracinate society.

330
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,180
Deracinate.

331
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,900
Tear out the roots.

332
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,540
A real people...

333
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:34,180
..derives its genius from the land,
from the sun, from the sea, from the soil.

334
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,620
This is how they know themselves.
But Jews don't even have soil.

335
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,660
- There's lsrael.
- Yeah. Those aren't Jews.

336
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,780
Of course they're Jews.

337
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,460
Notice the lsraelis.
lt's a fundamentally secular society.

338
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:53,140
They no longer need Judaism because
they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer.

339
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,660
He's a nomad.
He's got no roots and no attachments...

340
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,700
..so he universalises everything.

341
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,180
He can't hammer a nail or plough a field.

342
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,980
All he can do is buy and sell
and invest capital, manipulate markets...

343
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,180
..and it's, like, all mental.

344
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,580
He takes the life of a people rooted in soil
and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture,...

345
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,580
..based on books and numbers and ideas.

346
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,740
You know, this is his strength.

347
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:22,700
Take the greatest Jewish minds - Marx,
Freud, Einstein. What have they given us?

348
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,980
Communism, infantile sexuality
and the atom bomb.

349
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,540
ln the three centuries it's taken these people
to emerge from the ghettos of Europe,...

350
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,460
..they've ripped us out of a world of order
and reason, thrown us into class warfare,...

351
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,020
..irrational urges, relativity,...

352
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,380
..into a world where the very existence
of matter and meaning is in question!

353
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,180
Why?!

354
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,460
Cos it's the deepest impulse of a Jewish
soul to pull at the very fabric of life...

355
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,300
..till there's nothing left but a thread.

356
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,380
They want nothing but nothingness.

357
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,420
Nothingness without end.

358
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,060
Wow.

359
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,180
Danny, this is great.

360
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,340
You're incredibly articulate.

361
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,140
But one thing.

362
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,940
How can you believe all of this,...

363
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,340
..when... when you're a Jew yourself?

364
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,100
Excuse me?

365
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,060
Do you know a Rabbi Stanley Nadelman?

366
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:29,340
- He was at the Congregation Ohev Zedek.
- No... l... Who?

367
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,620
How would l know him?

368
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,100
He said you were bar mitzvahed there
in March of 1 888.

369
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,980
And you believe that?
And you call yourself a real reporter?

370
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,060
OK, so you say that's not true?

371
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,380
Do l look Jewish to you?

372
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,820
- Look at this!
- Were you bar mitzvahed anywhere else?

373
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,860
Do you have any idea
who you're fuckin' with here?

374
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,100
No.

375
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,140
Who am l fucking with here?

376
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,660
- Not a...
- Not a what?

377
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,460
Fuck you.

378
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,020
Why would Nadelman lie to me?

379
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,580
To discredit me.

380
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,940
- (mumbles)
- l know who they are.

381
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,140
l already explained this to you, Guy.

382
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,660
These people could say and do anything
and they will. lt's all narrative.

383
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,300
Are you gonna put what he said
in your paper?

384
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,860
- Give me a reason not to.
- Cos it's slander.

385
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,820
lt's reckless disregard. Cos l'm gonna
sue your fuckin' Jew paper, that's why.

386
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,540
So you're denying what he said is true?

387
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,140
Yes or no?

388
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,620
All right. Take it easy.

389
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,980
Hey.

390
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,740
Look at me, Guy.
You can't even look at me now, right?

391
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,500
(choking) OK.

392
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,740
- Please don't...
- You put that in the New York Times, Guy,...

393
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,460
(gags)

394
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,660
..and l'm gonna kill myself.

395
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,500
Avi, go ask Rabbi Springer to come
and remove Danny from my cIass.

396
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,980
Danny! DanieI BaIint!

397
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,220
Come back!

398
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,820
ls this it?

399
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,380
Thought there was people here.

400
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,700
l'll go look.

401
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,300
Hey, we're from New York.

402
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,420
- Curtis Zampf invited us.
- Who?

403
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,820
- l don't know no Curtis.
- Then why are you all here?

404
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,940
- Circle jerk?
- Yeah. Wanna join in?

405
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,100
- You look pretty good.
- l pitch.

406
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,620
(laughs)

407
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,380
- Whit. What's up?
- Billings.

408
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,900
Hi.

409
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,660
- Carlton.
- Danny.

410
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,380
How you doin'?

411
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,060
- Fuck!
- Hoo!

412
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,780
All right!

413
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,220
Fucker!

414
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,820
Welcome, fuckface.

415
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,860
(chatter and laughter)

416
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,580
Hey, give me a kiss!

417
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,820
You're not in New York any more!

418
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,620
(gags)

419
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,460
Fuck!

420
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,500
Get up! Get up!

421
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,100
- (coughs)
- Huh?

422
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,300
- Huh?
- (retches)

423
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,780
Which room was his room?

424
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,460
He had a small cabin down there.

425
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,060
- Wow.
- Man.

426
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,300
Look. Hitler in '38 took out the RAF,...

427
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,060
..which he could've easily, easily done.

428
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:08,100
Then he could've taken England. Then
the US would never have had to frickin'...

429
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,660
But he blew it by going after civilians.
Just like he blew it in Russia.

430
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,420
Stalingrad?

431
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,380
Gettysburg.

432
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,180
We're re-fighting it
with World War l technology.

433
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,380
lt's a fuckin' bloodbath.

434
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,380
lt's about time somebody kicked
that guy's ass. He's a fuckin' animal.

435
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,940
Not any more.

436
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,860
You shoulda done it.

437
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,620
Yeah, right(!)
Like l could do something like that.

438
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,300
Die, motherfucker!

439
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,660
You guys know anything about explosives?

440
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,300
Hell, yeah.

441
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,620
Good.

442
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,100
Remember, you control the gun.
The gun doesn't control you.

443
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,620
Relax. Take a deep breath.
Let it out as you pull the trigger.

444
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,700
OK. Again.

445
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,500
Which one were you aiming at?

446
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,140
Father.

447
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,940
Oh, check this guy out.

448
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,820
Hey, Drake!

449
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,340
Nice shooting.

450
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,540
Lina, the prisoner returns.

451
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,700
Danny! Help yourself to a drink.
l'll be there in a moment.

452
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,540
Why won't you talk to me?

453
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,500
- When can l see you?
- You can't.

454
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,180
l gotta go see my father.

455
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,620
- l'm coming to your room tonight.
- No, you're not.

456
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,780
l'm coming whether you like it or not.

457
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,700
(Lina) Carla!

458
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,420
Fine.

459
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,380
1 2 o'clock.

460
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,980
But not through the house. They'll hear you.

461
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,140
Use the porch roof.

462
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,340
l'll leave the window open.

463
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,860
(scraping metal)

464
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,300
(deep breaths)

465
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,420
Danny.

466
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,140
l was coming to say goodbye.
l'm going to Boston. Convert the lefties.

467
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,500
- Where's Mrs Moebius and, uh,...
- Carla?

468
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,660
She left about an hour ago.

469
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,460
How soon can you be back in the city?

470
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,620
'Bout a week or so.

471
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,140
There's something l wanna do out here first.

472
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,100
What's that?

473
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,660
Make an impact.

474
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,860
Skater boy!

475
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,140
Nice board, kid.

476
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,860
- Take the Pap smear to go!
- (laughter)

477
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,380
The gentile fish...

478
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,060
Oh, like his hair(!)

479
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,620
Who does your hair?

480
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,660
- What's Drake having?
- (laughter)

481
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,100
He'll have the waiter.

482
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,660
- You guys know what you want?
- We sure do.

483
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,060
Can l get a... a ham and cheese on white?

484
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,780
We don't serve ham, we don't serve cheese.

485
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,820
Well, it said white...
What the fuck do you serve?

486
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,860
That's why you have the menus.

487
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,820
Can l have roast beef with Swiss?

488
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,540
We don't serve cheese.

489
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:55,020
- What's wrong with cheese?
- This is a kosher restaurant.

490
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,700
We don't serve meat with dairy.

491
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,020
What about with chicken?

492
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,700
Chicken's meat.

493
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,420
Says in the Bible,
you don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk,...

494
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,740
..but chickens don't give milk.

495
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:11,220
You guys want cheese that badly,
there's a pizza place right next door.

496
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,900
lt's stupid, though, right?
Admit that it's stupid.

497
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,540
- You ever milk a chicken?
- (laughter)

498
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,420
No. l won't admit it's stupid.

499
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,220
You can have chickens with eggs,
but not with milk?

500
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,180
Why's that?

501
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,740
Steve.

502
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,100
Maybe Steve can explain it.

503
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,740
Hi, Steve!

504
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,940
- (sniggering)
- Steve, come here. You can explain it to us.

505
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,580
(jeering) Stevie got a stick!

506
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,940
No, no. Let's ask him. Hey.

507
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:44,420
- Got a problem here?
- We sure fuckin' do, bitch.

508
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,580
We don't understand
why you can't have chicken with milk.

509
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,100
lt doesn't make sense.

510
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:54,740
- Religion's not about making sense.
- lt's about the incomprehensible, Steve.

511
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,620
Not the idiotic!

512
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,780
(chuckles)

513
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,900
Fuck you.

514
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,980
''Fuck you.''

515
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,060
That explains it. Now we understand.

516
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,500
- Don't point your fuckin' finger in his face.
- All right. Why don't you guys just go?

517
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,140
lt's my store.

518
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,380
Whoa! Whoa!

519
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,540
Well,...

520
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,580
..since this fight seems to have been
instigated equally by both sides,...

521
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,860
..l'm going to give you a choice.

522
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,140
You can spend 30 days in jail,...

523
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,940
..or you can take some sensitivity training...

524
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:31,060
..with some people whose experiences
have been a bit different from yours.

525
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,980
When l refused to have sex with him,...

526
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,780
..the warden ordered my sister Esther shot...

527
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,380
..right in front of me.

528
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,620
Everyone considered it my fault,
so after that, of course,...

529
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,260
..l did anything he wanted.

530
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,540
Wouldn't wanna fuck her anyway.

531
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,620
(laughs)

532
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,660
One more remark like that and we go
back to court for resentencing. Sit down!

533
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,020
Please.

534
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,420
He was a pig like you, so,...

535
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,540
..perhaps he had no taste.

536
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,300
Thank you,...

537
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,580
..Mrs Frankel.

538
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,980
The man was afraid...

539
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,940
..to let us hide on his farm any longer,...

540
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,020
..but he agreed to take us
to a more remote place.

541
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,420
But...

542
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,260
..on the way,
he was stopped by a checkpoint.

543
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,020
When the soldiers found us in the hay,...

544
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:32,420
..one of them tried to take my son
out of my arms.

545
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,660
He began to cry, so l... l held onto him,...

546
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:40,860
..not to refuse the soldier,
but simply, simply...

547
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,820
..to assure my son l was there.

548
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:48,420
But... the sergeant became enraged.

549
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,980
He stuck his bayonet...

550
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,620
..in my son's chest...

551
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,940
..and lifted him up, impaled on it.

552
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,900
My son was three years old.

553
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:10,180
He... He held him so that the blood
spurting out of him fell on my face.

554
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,180
The soldiers were laughing.

555
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:22,580
And when the blood stopped,
the sergeant pushed my son...

556
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,500
..off his bayonet, and said...

557
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,260
..''There. You can have him now.''

558
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,140
What'd you do?

559
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,540
(counsellor) What are you trying to say?

560
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,860
What did you do while the sergeant
was killing your son?

561
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,660
(Mrs Frankel) What could he have done?!

562
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,900
What could he have done(?)

563
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,980
Sergeant's killing his kid!
What could he have done?

564
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,420
He could've jumped the guy,
gouged his eyes out, grabbed his bayonet...

565
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,740
They would've shot him on the spot.
He would've been dead in two seconds.

566
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,940
Who are you to judge?

567
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:59,500
So he's dead? Big deal. He's worse
than dead now. He's a piece of shit!

568
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,300
- That's it. You're going back.
- What should he have done(?)

569
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,460
Danny, don't listen to him.
lt's all a bunch of crap.

570
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,780
What's crap?

571
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,500
The so-called Holocaust.

572
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,180
lt never happened.

573
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,460
Oh, please(!)

574
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,260
lt's true, Danny. There was no six million.

575
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,940
At most 200,000 Jews died in the camps
and the majority of them...

576
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,340
- That's ridiculous.
- Have you seen the deportation figures?

577
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,460
The Nazis themselves kept records.

578
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:27,100
lf Hitler didn't kill six million Jews,
why in the hell is he a hero?

579
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,980
(hoots with laughter)

580
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,300
He's got concentration camps all over
Europe and he only gets rid of 200,000?

581
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,980
He's a fuckin' putz!

582
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,300
Hitler wasn't a putz. Hitler was real.

583
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,620
God created him to punish the Jews
for abandoning the Torah.

584
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,380
- For God's sake, not here.
- Remember who you're talking to.

585
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,940
lt is you who are putzes,...

586
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,380
..you little pishes,...

587
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,380
..with your dreams of hatred and killing.

588
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,500
What would you have done
if you had been there?

589
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,540
Not what he did.

590
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,980
Just stand there and watch?

591
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:06,060
How do you know?
You've never been tested like he has.

592
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,340
Here, in this rich, safe,...

593
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,500
..stupid country, it is so easy
to imagine oneself a hero.

594
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,860
But you have no idea what it was like.

595
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,500
You can't conceive of it.

596
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,620
Everything, all of Europe,...

597
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,740
..was designed to break one's will.

598
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,300
Millions went to camps,...

599
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,620
..many stronger, braver than you.

600
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,460
They did nothing.

601
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,260
Just as you would have done nothing.

602
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,500
Where do you think you're going?

603
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,900
We have nothing to learn from these people.

604
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,100
- You should be learning from us.
- And what should we learn...

605
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,140
..from you, Daniel?

606
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,220
Kill your enemy.

607
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,460
- What?
- Let me show you something.

608
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,460
What is it?

609
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:06,780
Black powder, blasting caps,
three-quarter-inch galvanised pipe.

610
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,940
- Enough to blow up a lot of people.
- Good.

611
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,180
Hey, Danny.

612
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,260
- Ah! Shit!
- Where's the light?

613
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,380
- Get the fuck off my foot.
- Fuck you.

614
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,540
lt's over here.

615
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:19,780
(switch clicks)

616
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,380
Shit.

617
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,940
(grunts)

618
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,740
Jew world!

619
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,900
(whooping, shouting)

620
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,540
- Come on! Bam, bam, fuck!
- l'm over here, man.

621
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,660
Over here! Over here!

622
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,820
Whoo!

623
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,700
Yeah, baby, yeah!

624
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,980
(shouting)

625
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,660
Yo!

626
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,260
(shouting)

627
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,180
Come on, Dan!

628
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,020
Yeah! Come on! Yeah!

629
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,500
(wood snaps)

630
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,060
- Hey, Avi.
` `
(loud crash)

631
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,140
(shouting)

632
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,180
(wood snaps)

633
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,980
Shut up? Fuck you.

634
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,660
What?

635
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,980
Nothin'. What is it?

636
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,100
Let's take one of these panels off
so we can get under the bima.

637
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,980
(laughter, shouting)

638
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,700
- Man!
- Fuck you. Jeez! Fuck!

639
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,900
(laughs nervously)

640
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,180
(clears throat)

641
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,780
Wow, man. Look at this.

642
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,140
What are you guys doin'?

643
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,180
(laughter)

644
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,220
Hey. Put it back.

645
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,500
Whoo!

646
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,220
- Hey!
- Put it back.

647
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,300
Look at the fuckin' thing.

648
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,900
- (laughter)
- Whoo!

649
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,860
Look at this.

650
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,540
(sings) = lf l...

651
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,300
= ..were king of the forest =

652
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,540
(silly voice) Not prince, not duke, not earl.

653
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,820
- All right. lt's set.
- Set?

654
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,700
OK. We should go.

655
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,540
Look at this fuckin' thing, man.

656
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,860
- Holy shit.
- lt's weird.

657
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,820
- They read right to Ieft.
- (Iaughter)

658
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,820
Looks Iike squashed bugs.

659
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,340
Danny, did they use bIood?

660
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,420
No, they used soy.

661
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,260
Danny, you aII right?

662
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,500
Neat calligraphy.

663
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,500
lt's called the flame alphabet.

664
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,860
They think it's the word of God
written in fire.

665
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,140
How come you know all this shit?

666
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,060
How come you don't? How can you hate
Jews if you don't know about them?

667
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,740
Fuck you! l hate the Jews
just as much as you.

668
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,140
Really? What's Shatnez?

669
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,620
Tsitsis?

670
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,180
- Titties!
- What?

671
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,740
- Tefillin?
- Who cares?

672
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,140
You know the Kaddish from the Kiddush?

673
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,460
lf you really hate something,
you study it so you know why you hate it.

674
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,100
Eichmann - he studied the Torah,
the Talmud, the Mishnah,...

675
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,580
..the whole thing.

676
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,300
He hated Jews.

677
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,100
- Who's Eichmann?
- Who's Eichmann(?)

678
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,660
Eichmann was head of the Gestapo's Jewish
sector. He deported people to the camps.

679
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,380
(blows raspberry)

680
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,060
Hey, don't touch it. Don't touch the letters.

681
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,300
Why the fuck not?

682
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,140
Just don't!

683
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:48,780
- Asshole!
- Didn't you see Raiders Of The Lost Ark?

684
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,820
What?

685
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,700
That was an Ark, man, that was a Torah.

686
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,300
They fucked around with it
and melted their faces.

687
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,420
- That was a movie, asshole.
- Go ahead, touch the letters.

688
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,980
- Touch the letters.
- Let me see.

689
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,820
Let me see.

690
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,100
Hey!

691
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:12,980
Hey!

692
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:14,980
What do you think of that?

693
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,260
l told...

694
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,300
Fuck them!

695
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,660
Fuck them!

696
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,900
Fuck you!

697
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,940
Let's go.

698
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,380
Come on, man. Let's get the fuck outta here.

699
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,980
Hey! Let's go!

700
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,100
(TV) Everyone's a IittIe wary
about what's gonna happen.

701
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,820
Shit, guys, this is it.

702
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,900
- Hi. I'm Cindy Pomerantz, ChanneI 8 News.
- Guys! Guys!

703
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,540
Guys! Get in here. This is it.

704
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,940
How is it today that tragedy and disaster
were averted in the tempIe?

705
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:35,100
The power ceII in the timer gave out
1 3 minutes before it was set to go off.

706
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,620
Shit!

707
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,580
Once again, God intervened
to save the Jewish peopIe.

708
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:45,780
Cindy, as you know,
1 3 is a mysticaI number in the Jewish faith.

709
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,180
We beIieve God that has 1 3 attributes,...

710
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,900
..of which the highest is ein sof...

711
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,180
..which means ''without end''...

712
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:58,180
..or sometimes it means
''nothingness without end. ''

713
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,060
(Cindy) Nothingness without end.

714
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,460
Interesting.

715
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:04,820
It's the purest form of spirit.

716
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,060
- Fuck.
- Somebody turn on cartoons.

717
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:14,940
I'm Cindy Pomerantz, ChanneI 8 News,
in front of TempIe Ahavat Torah.

718
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,420
(breathes heavily)

719
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,500
= Vezot ha Torah

720
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,220
= Vezot ha Torah

721
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,580
Danny!

722
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,060
What?

723
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,580
Phone.

724
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,940
- Hello.
- Hey. DanieI BaIint.

725
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,940
How you doin'?

726
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,780
Who's this?

727
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,300
Guy DanieIson.

728
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,100
Whatever happened to your article?

729
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,860
I couIdn't get an editor to run it.

730
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:06,420
But I bet I can now that
you put a bomb in the synagogue.

731
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,220
That was you, wasn't it, Danny?

732
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:15,620
Hey.

733
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,700
You wanna kill a Jew?

734
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,260
lt's right up there.

735
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,740
We'll just park around the corner
and we'll walk back.

736
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:47,460
(crickets chirrup)

737
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,100
Take care.

738
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,980
There's the applause.
(cocks trigger) Must be over.

739
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,060
Lie on your stomach
and come up on your elbows.

740
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,380
Why me?

741
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,340
Cos you wanna kill a Jew. l already did.

742
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,700
Really?

743
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,460
- Who'd you kill?
- Four of them.

744
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,340
But no-one this important.

745
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,340
How'd you know they were Jews?

746
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,100
l can tell.

747
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:19,860
How?

748
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,020
l was a Jew in a previous life.

749
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,540
- (Manzetti) l thank you all very much.
- Here they come.

750
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,900
Thank you again.

751
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,860
Shoot him in the head.

752
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,540
Always shoot a Jew in the head.

753
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:38,140
- l'm a bad shot.
- Just keep him in the cross hairs.

754
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,300
(Manzetti) You can call my office.

755
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,180
Right there.

756
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,620
Squeeze the trigger, slowly.

757
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,540
Do it.

758
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,420
Oh, my God!

759
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,540
- Damn it!
- You missed on purpose.

760
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,660
No, l didn't. l had him in the cross hairs.

761
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,740
- lt's just l'm a bad shot.
- What's this?

762
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,020
What?

763
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,220
Fuckin' kike. l knew it.

764
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,740
- (blade swishes)
- (gunshot)

765
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,020
(cries out)

766
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,660
lt came from over there.

767
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,220
Ah!

768
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,980
Shit.

769
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,540
(siren)

770
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,540
(Danny) The whoIe Jewish peopIe
were permanentIy scarred...

771
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,700
..by what happened at Mount Moriah.
And we stiII Iive in terror.

772
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:35,260
(boy) Fear of the Lord
is the beginning of wisdom.

773
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,700
Fear of God makes you
afraid of everything.

774
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:41,660
AII the Jews are good at is being afraid,
at being sacrificed.

775
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,900
(bangs gaveI)

776
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,460
Do you even beIieve in God?

777
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,860
I'm the onIy one who does beIieve.

778
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:49,660
I see him for the power-drugged madman
that he is.

779
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,620
And we're supposed to worship this deity?

780
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,740
I say, never!

781
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,500
Avi,...

782
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,340
..go ask Rabbi Springer to come
and remove Danny from my cIass.

783
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,900
And, you,...

784
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:05,180
..if you had come out of Egypt, you wouId've
been destroyed in the desert,...

785
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,460
..with aII those who worship the goIden caIf.

786
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,420
Then Iet Him destroy me now.

787
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,980
Let Him crush me
Iike the conceited buIIy that He is.

788
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,780
Go ahead.

789
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,900
Danny!

790
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,020
DanieI BaIint!

791
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,060
Come back!

792
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,940
(footsteps)

793
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,220
(foghorn)

794
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:44,700
- How are things going?
- Fine.

795
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:46,980
We'd like to talk to you about something.

796
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,940
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

797
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:57,380
We are about to launch
an above-ground, intellectually serious,...

798
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,340
..fascist movement.

799
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,420
We wanna build bridges to certain positions
in the political mainstream.

800
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:06,060
Works like The BeII Curve, SociaI BioIogy,
Earth First, The Genome Project.

801
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:09,740
We'll have lectures,
invite blacks and Jews and liberals.

802
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,180
Chomsky speaks, Stanley Crouch.

803
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,860
You know, l've been waiting my whole life
for something like this.

804
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,100
We want you to help us run it.

805
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,540
Give speeches,...

806
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:22,540
..lead seminars, handle the fundraising.

807
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:27,140
- Handle the fundraising?
- We need someone with intelligence.

808
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,060
Well, what about the synagogues
and Manzetti and all that?

809
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,940
We need intellectuals.
We have enough thugs.

810
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,700
l'm not an intellectual.

811
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,060
l mean, l... l read, but...

812
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:41,420
Fundraising is just... lt's...

813
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,940
Danny,...

814
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,100
..we want you to talk to people.

815
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,380
Can you do that for us?

816
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:52,180
Well, yeah, sure, l can... You know.

817
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,980
(Lina) Do you have a decent suit?

818
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:56,540
(Curtis) We'll get him one.

819
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,020
We'll sort him out.

820
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:02,740
We'll get him a cellphone
and, er, anything else he needs.

821
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,900
(vomits)

822
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,420
(coughs)

823
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,500
(shower)

824
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,020
Where'd you get this?

825
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,940
Where'd l get what?

826
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,540
What are you doing?

827
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,180
Where'd you get it?

828
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,660
We stole it from a synagogue.

829
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,220
Can you read it?

830
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:41,740
Put something on, all right? You're not
supposed to be naked in front of it.

831
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:43,260
Why not?

832
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:48,820
Because it's... They think it's the word
of God and it's holy and the flesh isn't.

833
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,420
That's stupid.

834
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,340
Yes, it's stupid. Put something on.

835
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,700
You see, the Jews love to separate things.

836
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,060
The holy from the profane,
the meat from the milk,...

837
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:06,260
..the wool from the linen,
the Sabbath from the week,...

838
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,940
..the Jew from the gentile.

839
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:11,860
lt's as if one little scrap of this
is gonna completely contaminate that.

840
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:16,260
Who gets contaminated?
The Jews or the gentiles?

841
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,060
lt's a good question.

842
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,020
How come there's no punctuation?

843
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,940
That was a later invention and...

844
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:32,500
..Jews don't really need it, because
they know the whole thing by heart.

845
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,100
Every word and every letter.

846
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,940
Do you know it like that? By heart?

847
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,260
No.

848
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:42,580
But you can read it, right?

849
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:44,500
The Hebrew.

850
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:48,060
- What do you care?
- Because l wanna know.

851
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,260
- What's this word?
- Don't touch it. Um,...

852
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,580
That's uh,...

853
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,700
''Va'yomer... ''

854
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,580
''And he said...''

855
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,540
What did he say?

856
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,500
''Va'yomer Adonai I'Avram...

857
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:14,140
..Iech Iecha meartzecha u'mimoIadetcha...

858
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:17,260
..umibet avicha eI ha'aretz asher...

859
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,100
..arecha. ''

860
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:22,060
What does it mean?

861
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,340
''And God said to Avram,...

862
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,380
..take yourself away from your land,...

863
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:30,620
..away from the place you were born,
away from your father's house,...

864
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,860
(sighs) ..and go to a new land,...

865
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,140
..a place that l will show you.''

866
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,540
l want you to teach it to me.

867
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,020
Why?

868
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,460
Know your enemy.

869
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:53,860
Because it's a basic text of Western culture
and l wanna read it in the original.

870
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:57,300
- OK?
- Listen, it's extremely difficult.

871
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,140
lt'll take you years to learn it.

872
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,460
l'm good at languages.

873
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:09,580
OK.

874
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,260
You get that piece of paper
and that pen over there.

875
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,700
- AIeph.
- Looks like a little swastika.

876
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,300
lt's silent and it takes a vowel.

877
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:32,460
There aren't any vowels, there are just dots
that go underneath the letters.

878
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,340
l'll get you a chumash.

879
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:38,980
- (Danny) Beth.
- (Carla) Beth.

880
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:42,100
- GimeI.
- GimeI.

881
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,380
- DaIeth.
- DaIeth.

882
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,900
- Heh.
- Heh.

883
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:51,540
How come you're here and not with Curtis?

884
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:54,940
And don't say
it's cos of the free Hebrew lesson.

885
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,300
The sex is better.

886
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:02,500
Even though he's, uh,
he's got such a big dick?

887
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:07,660
When l'm with you,
there's a tragic dimension.

888
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:16,740
How many of you consider yourselves
anti-Semites?

889
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:20,420
Good.

890
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:24,940
Actually the term's imprecise, seeing as
Jews are only one of the Semitic peoples,...

891
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:29,500
..but for our purposes, we'll say that
an anti-Semite is someone that hates...

892
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,860
..or is against Jews.

893
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,300
Why do we hate 'em?

894
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,060
Let me put it this way.

895
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:41,740
Do we hate 'em cos they push their way in
where they don't belong?

896
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:46,140
Or do we hate 'em cos they're clannish
and they keep to themselves?

897
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:49,340
Cos they're tight with money,
or cos they flash it around?

898
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:52,060
Cos they're Bolsheviks
or because they're capitalists?

899
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:56,220
Cos they have the highest lQs
or cos they have the most active sex lives?

900
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,900
You wanna know the real reason
why we hate 'em?

901
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:02,820
Cos we hate 'em.

902
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,700
Cos it's an axiom of civilisation,...

903
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,100
..that just as man longs for woman,
loves his children and fears death,...

904
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,860
..he hates Jews.

905
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,140
There's no reason.

906
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:18,100
And if there were, some smart-assed kike
would try and prove us wrong,...

907
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,500
..which would only make us hate 'em
even more!

908
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:23,900
And really, we have all the reasons we need
in three simple letters.

909
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,300
J... E... W.

910
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:27,980
Jew!

911
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:31,220
You say it a million times, it's the only word
that never loses its meaning.

912
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:32,620
Jew.

913
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,940
Jew. Jew. Jew.

914
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:38,260
Jew. Jew. Jew. Jew. Jew. Jew. Jew.

915
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,300
(car horns blare)

916
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,940
l'll give your group 1 ,000 bucks.

917
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:48,860
You gave 50,000 to that college magazine.

918
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,900
Things were possible then that aren't now.

919
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:56,740
l actually feel at this moment
there's a lot of possibilities.

920
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:59,300
l read your piece. lt's very smart.

921
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,220
And very wrong.

922
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,220
ln what ways?

923
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:07,100
Forget the Jewish stuff.
lt doesn't play any more.

924
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:09,820
There's only the market now
and it doesn't care who you are.

925
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,060
- People still need values and beliefs.
- No, they don't.

926
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:16,220
Not the smart ones.

927
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:22,220
Look, l'll give you five grand if you can
document your tactics and status.

928
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:26,340
But when you fall off this horse,
come see me.

929
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:28,540
l could show you
how to make a lot of money.

930
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,820
l don't care about money.

931
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:33,540
You will.

932
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:37,020
You're a Jew.

933
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:39,740
You may not realise it but you are.

934
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:43,940
Maybe l am. Maybe we're all Jews now.
What's the difference?

935
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:55,700
What about... Drake?
Did he ever show up?

936
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:58,380
Uh, no, man. lt's weird. No-one's seen him.

937
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:02,740
Hey, listen, Danny. This is gonna be
a completely different kind of device, OK?

938
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,900
Stupid thing. D'you have any idea
how that made me look?

939
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:07,900
- ln front of Curtis and Lina.
- l know, l know.

940
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:09,500
l'm sorry. lt won't happen again, OK?

941
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:12,860
l got a brand-new timer
plus a back-up power source.

942
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,460
Gotta kill some Jews.

943
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,060
lt's all l ever talk about
and this time it's gotta happen.

944
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,220
lt will.

945
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,340
You should go.

946
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:11,260
(woman) On Shabbos, is it permitted to
pick up the phone if it rings for a Iong time?

947
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:12,780
(man) No. It couId be a wrong number.

948
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:15,180
If you think it might be a reIative
needing heIp,...

949
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:18,700
..knock the phone off the hook with your
eIbow and Iisten to see who's on the Iine.

950
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:22,500
(woman) When is it forbidden to...

951
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:24,820
The TaImud teaches us...

952
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,500
- May we peeI oranges on Shabbos?
- Yes, but...

953
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,020
..peeI them immediateIy.

954
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:31,340
- If you see a...
- Is it permitted...

955
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,820
- (many voices overIap)
- Danny?

956
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,340
Danny?

957
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:39,220
- (voices continue)
- Danny! Hey!

958
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:41,020
Stuart.

959
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,300
Schoenbaum.

960
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,580
Shlomo.

961
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,740
- Shlomo.
- Danny. God!

962
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:51,820
God, it's... it's been years.

963
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,740
- How you doin'? How are you doin'?
- l'm doing great.

964
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:02,260
l'm at the rabbinic program up at JTS.

965
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,780
JTS.

966
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:07,780
What about you? What are you doing?
Something strange, l bet.

967
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:09,300
Uh,...

968
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,500
No, it's kind of an underground thing.

969
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:14,540
Like an artist?

970
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:15,900
No.

971
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:18,620
Uh, like a private business.

972
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:22,340
Hey. You remember Miriam?

973
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:25,380
Yeah.

974
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:26,980
Hey.

975
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,460
Hey.

976
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,980
She's at Yale Law now,
interning for the District Attorney.

977
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:34,180
We're getting married next spring
in Jerusalem.

978
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,100
That's great.

979
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:39,140
Maybe Danny'd like to come to
the minyan for Rosh Hashanah.

980
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,620
That's a great idea.

981
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,620
We're davening with a group from
the seminary. Guess who comes? Avi!

982
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:46,460
You two can go at it like you used to.

983
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:51,020
Danny and Avi used to argue about
everything. Talmud, Torah, politics,...

984
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,180
- ..girls. Always ended in a fist-fight.
- l remember.

985
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:55,660
l always won.

986
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,580
The arguments, anyway.

987
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:00,100
Here. lt's up at Kl on 101st.

988
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,500
Try to make it. Could be fun.

989
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:09,900
Yeah.

990
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:17,860
= My country, 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty

991
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:21,500
= Of thee l sing =

992
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:39,500
(Carla) Lo Ta'asher...

993
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:42,020
(grunts)

994
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:43,340
Ta'aseh.

995
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,140
Ta'aseh.

996
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:47,740
VekoI peseI.

997
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,460
VekoI tmunah.

998
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:51,660
Tmunah.

999
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:56,660
''Make no graven image of the Lord
or the form of any figure...

1000
01:10:56,740 --> 01:11:00,020
..of man or woman,
or anything that looks like anything.''

1001
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:03,020
Because He's not like anything.

1002
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:05,740
Not only can you not see Him or hear Him,...

1003
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:08,140
..but you can't even think about Him?

1004
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:12,860
l mean, what's the difference between that
and Him not existing at all?

1005
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,100
There's no difference.

1006
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:21,620
l mean, Christianity's silly, but at least
there's something to believe in.

1007
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,740
Or not believe.

1008
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:27,820
- ln Judaism, there's nothing.
- Nothing but nothingness.

1009
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,100
Judaism's not really about belief.

1010
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:32,580
lt's about doing things.

1011
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:37,660
Keeping the Sabbath, lighting candles,
visiting the sick.

1012
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,620
And belief follows?

1013
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,500
Nothing follows.

1014
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:46,700
Cos you don't do it because it's smart,...

1015
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:50,260
..or stupid, or because you get saved,
because nobody gets saved.

1016
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,780
You just do it because the Torah tells you to
and you submit to the Torah.

1017
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:55,660
That is fucked.

1018
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:58,100
Don't swear in front of it, OK?

1019
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:01,860
- Why should l submit?
- You shouldn't.

1020
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:06,820
You think l should
just because there's no reason.

1021
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,420
l think you shouldn't.

1022
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:13,900
Judaism doesn't even need a God.
You have the Torah, that's your fucking God.

1023
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:15,900
Book's closed.

1024
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,020
l think your Hebrew's getting real good.

1025
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:27,740
l told you l was good at this.

1026
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,980
You also had nothing else to do all day, so...

1027
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:34,700
What are you saying?
l learnt it better and faster than you did?

1028
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,380
Maybe it's because l'm smarter.

1029
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:41,260
You think that's funny?

1030
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:44,060
Think Jews are the only smart ones?

1031
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:48,940
Think l'm Jewish?

1032
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:53,380
lt's all you ever talk about.
Jewish, Jewish, Jewish.

1033
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:56,980
Only people that ever talk about it
that much are Jews.

1034
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:00,580
- Nazis talk about it all the time.
- Do they?

1035
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:06,140
Real ones. Hitler and Goebbels,
they talked about it incessantly.

1036
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:11,020
ls that why you became a Nazi?
To talk about Jews incessantly?

1037
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:15,340
- D'you want a punch in the mouth?
- OK.

1038
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:22,540
Let's light candles on Friday.

1039
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,660
Say the Kaddish.

1040
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:28,740
The Kaddish is a prayer for the dead.

1041
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,420
Kiddush. Say the Kiddush.

1042
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,740
Light candles.

1043
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:37,180
Come on.

1044
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:41,180
We could shave my head,
fuck through a sheet, all that stuff.

1045
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:44,380
Let's just try it.

1046
01:13:44,460 --> 01:13:46,900
= Barchu et Adonai hamevorach

1047
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:49,060

1050
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:55,300

01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:57,420
= Baruch ata Adonai, noten hatorah =

01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,900
(congregation) = Amen =

1053
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:03,860
(whispers) Danny. Hi.

1054
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,340
(chanting of the Torah)

1055
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:09,900
God said to him ''Abraham, ''
and he answered ''Here I am. ''

1056
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:12,380
And he said ''Take your son,...

1057
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,820
..your onIy son, whom you Iove, Isaac,
and go to the Iand...

1058
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,820
He's not his only son.

1059
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,940
The only one he loves.

1060
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:22,460
- Hey, Avi.
- Hey.

1061
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,460
- Good Yom Tov.
- Shanah Tovah.

1062
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:26,940
Only kill the ones you love, right?

1063
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,140
Why are you here?
Thought you were an anti-Semite.

1064
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:31,140
- Will you two grow up?
- He's a skinhead.

1065
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:34,900
- lt's a style! There are anti-racist skins.
- Believe me, Danny's the racist kind.

1066
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:36,300
Are you a fascist, yes or no?

1067
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:37,820
- Shh!
- He thinks the Jews are wimps.

1068
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:40,940
- What's a fascist?
- l rest my case.

1069
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,620
He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.

1070
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:45,100
- Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
- The Zionists are not Nazis.

1071
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,620
They're racist, they're militaristic. They act
like storm troopers in the Territories.

1072
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,660
And do you hate them because they're
wimps or because they're storm troopers?

1073
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:53,980
They don't have extermination camps.

1074
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:56,460
- They have Sabra and Shatila.
- Or do you just hate them?

1075
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:59,700
That was the Lebanese killing each other.
The lsraelis knew nothing about it.

1076
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:03,380
- Sharon encouraged the Falangists to go in.
- We don't know that.

1077
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:05,380
- There's no proof.
- Have you ever read the New York Times?

1078
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,140
lt was a war. People got killed.

1079
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:09,940
l wanna know why the Jews are always held
to a higher standard than everybody else.

1080
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:13,180
Because we're the Chosen People.
lsn't that right, Daniel?

1081
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,260
- lsn't that right?
- Uh... Listen.

1082
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,140
Read early Zionists on European Jewry.

1083
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,180
- They sound exactly like Goebbels.
- They sound like you.

1084
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:23,260
Just how Nazis did everything that Hitler told
them, you do everything the Torah tells you.

1085
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,260
- lt's identical...
- Shh. Stop it!

1086
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:27,820
- We don't want that in here.
- Avi, outside.

1087
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,100
Not in shul.

1088
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:33,140
Why'd you come tonight? To see me?

1089
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:35,620
To study Torah.

1090
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,820
Thought you hated Torah.

1091
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:43,260
- Doesn't mean l don't like to study it.
- Expose all the lies and fucked-up thinking.

1092
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:47,860
D'you know the joke of a Jew
shipwrecked on the desert island?

1093
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:50,380
When they rescue him,
they see he's built two synagogues.

1094
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,660
They said
''For what you built two synagogues?''

1095
01:15:52,740 --> 01:15:56,500
He says ''One to pray in and one
l'd never set foot in so long as l live,...

1096
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:58,580
..so help me God.''

1097
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:02,860
You pray in the one you'd never set foot in.

1098
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:06,060
And vice versa.

1099
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,260
This is me.

1100
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,900
Tell me about Lina Moebius.

1101
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:17,260
- How did you know about Lina?
- l work in the DA's office.

1102
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,060
Go to those meetings,
half the people there are informants.

1103
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:24,820
- Like who? That Times guy?
- Which Times guy?

1104
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:26,540
There's more than one?

1105
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,940
- Fuck.
- Be careful.

1106
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:40,060
Half the right-wing money in New York
is here tonight.

1107
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,460
They've come to see you.

1108
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:45,940
lf you impress them,
if you do what l know you can,...

1109
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:48,140
..this movement will be up and running
by tomorrow.

1110
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:53,220
And we will be on the front page
of the New York Times in six months.

1111
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,620
- Here he is.
- ls that him?

1112
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:58,340
(applause)

1113
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:01,100
- Balint.
- Daniel Balint.

1114
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:13,260
(chants) = Sh'ma, IsraeI,...

1115
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:18,820
- = ..Adonai eIoheinu, Adonai echad =
- What is this?

1116
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:23,780
- Does anyone know what that is?
- A Jewish prayer.

1117
01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:29,300
A Jewish prayer. Do you have any idea
why l would say a Jewish prayer?

1118
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:31,540
- Because you're a Jew!
- (laughter)

1119
01:17:32,740 --> 01:17:34,740
That could be one reason. What's another?

1120
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:38,980
Let me put it this way.

1121
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:41,980
Who wants to destroy the Jews?

1122
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,180
(murmuring)

1123
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:46,740
Who wants to grind their bones
into the dust?

1124
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:48,860
And who wants to see them rise again?

1125
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:54,260
Wealthier, more successful, powerful,
cultured, more intelligent than ever?

1126
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,820
Then you know what we have to do?

1127
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:03,380
We have to love 'em.

1128
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:07,420
What? Did he say ''Love the Jews''?
lt's strange, l know.

1129
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,500
But with these people, nothing is simple.

1130
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:14,580
The Jew says all he wants is to be left alone
to study his Torah,...

1131
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:16,580
..do a little business,...

1132
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:19,420
..fornicate with his oversexed wife,
but it's not true.

1133
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,660
- (laughter)
- He wants to be hated.

1134
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:25,220
He longs for our scorn.

1135
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:28,420
He clings to it,
as if it were the very core of his being.

1136
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:32,980
lf Hitler had not existed,
the Jews would've invented him.

1137
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:39,700
For without such hatred, the so-called
Chosen People would vanish from the earth.

1138
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:44,540
And this reveals a terrible truth
and the crux of our problem as Nazis.

1139
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:48,420
The worse the Jews are treated,
the stronger they become.

1140
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:51,340
Egyptian slavery made them a nation.

1141
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:55,660
The pogroms hardened them.
Auschwitz gave birth to the state of lsrael.

1142
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:59,220
Suffering, it seems,
is the very crucible of their genius.

1143
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:02,460
So, if the Jews are,
as one of their own has said,...

1144
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:06,420
..a people who will not take ''yes''
for an answer,...

1145
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,700
..let us say ''yes'' to them.

1146
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:12,100
They thrive on opposition.
Let us cease to oppose them.

1147
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:16,900
The only way to annihilate
this insidious people once and for all...

1148
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:20,700
..is to open our arms,
invite them into our homes...

1149
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,780
..and embrace them.

1150
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:27,340
Only then will they vanish into assimilation,
normality and love.

1151
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:32,140
But we cannot pretend.
The Jew is nothing if not clever.

1152
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:36,180
He will see through hypocrisy
and condescension.

1153
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:39,980
To destroy him, we must love him sincerely.

1154
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:41,020
(mumbling)

1155
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:43,660
Yes?

1156
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:48,580
lf the Jews are strengthened by hate,
wouldn't this...

1157
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:53,140
..destruction that you speak of,
whether it's by love or any other means,...

1158
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:56,380
..wouldn't that make them more powerful
than they are already?

1159
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:57,460
Yes.

1160
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,260
lnfinitely more.

1161
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,500
They would become as God.

1162
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:03,460
(mumbling)

1163
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:07,660
lt's the Jews' destiny to be annihilated
so they can be deified.

1164
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,900
Jesus understood this perfectly.

1165
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:14,940
And look what was accomplished there
with the death of just one enlightened Jew.

1166
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:18,540
lmagine what would happen
if we killed them all.

1167
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:23,260
So, let us say together,...
= Sh'ma, IsraeI,... =

1168
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:26,700
Are you out of your mind?!

1169
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:28,900
Just making a point.

1170
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:33,620
What point?

1171
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:37,700
l do not want you working for us any more.

1172
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:39,940
(Curtis) Lina.

1173
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:41,580
Lina, come here!

1174
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:44,540
According to the poIice,
he had just Ieft the restaurant...

1175
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,540
..and was waIking back to his office,...

1176
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:51,060
..when the gunman stepped out here,
fired seven times at point-bIank range,...

1177
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:52,620
..and fIed on foot.

1178
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,380
Paramedics arrived within 90 seconds,...

1179
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:57,460
..but Mr Manzetti was decIared dead
at the scene.

1180
01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:02,420
The assaiIant is described as a white maIe
in his twenties. IIio Manzetti...

1181
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,300
- D'you think that l...?
- Danny,...

1182
01:21:05,380 --> 01:21:07,620
..we don't wanna know.

1183
01:21:20,980 --> 01:21:22,900
Hey, Mr Manzetti.

1184
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,180
Hey, Mr Manzetti.

1185
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:41,980
Did you kill llio Manzetti?

1186
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:49,940
(gunshot)

1187
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:58,300
Lina Moebius says the whole thing was your
idea. She says you proposed it at her house.

1188
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,340
Oh, Jesus, Danny!

1189
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:03,900
- l can't help what l think.
- You don't think that!

1190
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:05,300
l don't.

1191
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:07,500
Tell me you think it.

1192
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:12,020
Are you glad Manzetti's dead? You really
wanna kill Jews? You wanna kill me?

1193
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:20,140
What if, all along, you were actually
infiltrating the Nazis to expose them?

1194
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:23,660
- l wasn't.
- The Manzetti thing was to convince them...

1195
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:26,940
- l can't say that.
- lf you knew they'd actually shoot the guy...

1196
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:28,060
lt's not true!

1197
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:31,260
Think about your father. Linda.

1198
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:34,260
You don't care about the truth at all, do you?

1199
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:35,900
Danny, l'm trying to save you.

1200
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:38,140
Fucking...

1201
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:39,460
..kike!

1202
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,740
l need you to get Lina Moebius on tape,...

1203
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:58,340
..telling you to do something,...

1204
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:00,420
..something violent.

1205
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:02,900
l don't care about the truth.

1206
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:04,420
l care about you.

1207
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:10,260
Kol Nidrei's at 6.30. l gotta meet Stuart.
Come there if you need me.

1208
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:34,340
What is this?

1209
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:39,380
lt's erev Yom Kippur.
We'll have dinner, then go to shul.

1210
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:41,500
Atone for our sins.

1211
01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:46,420
Come on. We can be like Eichmann.

1212
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:49,100
He studied Torah. He hated Jews.

1213
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:54,180
ls it like Eichmann? You're just goofing?

1214
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,540
l don't know. l just wanted to try it.

1215
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,340
Why?

1216
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,300
Because God commands it.

1217
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:06,900
Thought God didn't exist.

1218
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:11,740
Well, He commands it,
whether He exists or not.

1219
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:16,860
Look, we can fight Him and be crushed,
or we can submit.

1220
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,860
- And be crushed.
- But...

1221
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:24,620
What if... What if submitting,
being crushed,...

1222
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,500
..being nothing, not mattering,...

1223
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:30,340
..what if that's the best feeling we can have?

1224
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:36,780
Look, just light the candles with me.

1225
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:39,060
Then we can eat. You have to eat.

1226
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,340
You eat first, then you light the candles,...

1227
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:43,820
..cos once you light the candles, it's...

1228
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:46,260
..Yom Kippur and you're fasting.

1229
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,020
l gotta go.

1230
01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:02,180
Miriam, pick up the phone.

1231
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:05,940
The holiday hasn't even started yet.
Pick up... Hello?

1232
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:09,420
Stuart's davening Ne'ilah tomorrow, right?

1233
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,180
Cos he always does.

1234
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:13,420
Tell him l'm doing it instead.

1235
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,580
l'm davening.

1236
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:19,220
Tell him if he gives me any trouble,
l'll beat the shit out of him right there.

1237
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:21,900
- Did you kiII Manzetti?
- No, I didn't.

1238
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:24,260
Drake did.

1239
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:29,820
ls this 60th? Turn here. Turn right.

1240
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:31,700
- Wh... Why? Why?
- Just do it.

1241
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:35,900
Not so fast. Would you relax?

1242
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:42,980
(whispers) Right in here.

1243
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:47,660
Uh...

1244
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:51,500
- What time do you want it to go off?
- Shh.

1245
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,260
(whispers) 7.30 tomorrow night.

1246
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:55,220
OK, that's, uh,...

1247
01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:59,740
- 1 8.30 minus...
- Shh, shh.

1248
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,820
(high-pitched beep)

1249
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:09,860
Hand me the tape.

1250
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:11,540
Here.

1251
01:26:11,620 --> 01:26:13,140
lt's all reinforced in here.

1252
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,300
lt's not gonna blow up the way we want.

1253
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:18,300
Look, l know this guy.
l can get some dynamite...

1254
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:20,980
No. lt has to be tomorrow.

1255
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:24,380
lt's gonna be fine,
as long as it blows up the pulpit.

1256
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:27,380
- lt's not gonna be fine...
- Do it.

1257
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:14,540
IIio Manzetti...

1258
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:18,220
..was one of the most respected
and infIuentiaI men in New York.

1259
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,820
As an investment banker, dipIomat,...

1260
01:27:19,900 --> 01:27:22,340
..advisor to presidents and mayors,...

1261
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:26,900
..he heIped shape pubIic and private poIicy
for more than three decades.

1262
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:28,940
He'II be missed.

1263
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:32,620
This is MichaeI Porter for New York One.

1264
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:38,060
When he first came to your house,
you had no idea that he was Jewish?

1265
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:39,620
None whatsoever.

1266
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:42,260
But I can't say I'm terribIy surprised.

1267
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:43,700
What do you mean?

1268
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:48,740
I think anti-Semitism today is IargeIy
a Jewish phenomenon. Don't you agree?

1269
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:52,300
In the Third Reich,... weren't a number
of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?

1270
01:28:02,220 --> 01:28:03,260
Yom Tov.

1271
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:11,380
(woman chants Torah)

1272
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:14,780
(woman) ..cast lots, to find out on account of
whom misfortune has come upon us.

1273
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:15,980
They cast lots...

1274
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,060
..and the lot fell on Jonah.

1275
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:20,220
They said to him...

1276
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:24,460
''Tell us, you, who has brought this
misfortune, where have you come from?''

1277
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:26,460
''What is your country
and of what people are you?''

1278
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:31,140
''l am a Hebrew,'' he replied.
''l worship the Lord, the God of heaven,...

1279
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:33,340
..who made both sea and land.''

1280
01:28:33,780 --> 01:28:35,580
(whispers) Hey.

1281
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:38,780
What are you doing here?

1282
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:41,300
Miriam called, looking for you.

1283
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:44,940
- She told me about the service.
- Shh. Would you be quiet?

1284
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:47,140
- Well, you gotta go, OK?
- What?

1285
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:49,420
Look, l understand you want to daven,
but...

1286
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,020
Stuart, shut up!

1287
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:53,300
Danny, please.

1288
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:58,740
- Listen, you have to leave.
- Young man, please!

1289
01:28:58,820 --> 01:28:59,820
Shh!

1290
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:01,620
Hey.

1291
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:03,860
(whispers) Please take this outside.

1292
01:29:03,940 --> 01:29:07,580
- You're leaving. That's it.
- l'm trying to read this, OK?

1293
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:09,940
''What must we give to you
to make the sea calm around us?''...

1294
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:12,940
..for the sea was growing
more and more stormy.

1295
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,380
He answered,...

1296
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:16,780
..''Heave me overboard
and the sea will calm down,...

1297
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:20,380
..for l know this terrible storm
came upon you on my account.''

1298
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:24,100
(kicks)

1299
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:43,700
(gunshot)

1300
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:54,260
Danny, they are expecting me to daven.
They don't want someone they don't know.

1301
01:29:54,340 --> 01:29:56,420
Stuart, l gotta do this.

1302
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:06,220
Page 450.

1303
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:16,020
YisgadaI veyiskadash sh'meh rabah...

1304
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:18,780
Jesus Christ. You know who that is?

1305
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:20,420
Did you see the paper?

1306
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,420
You mean the paper on Yom Kippur(?)

1307
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:26,900
l saw the paper. lt's not him. This guy was
at Rosh Hashanah with Stuart and Miriam.

1308
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:29,220
- That guy would never go to shul.
- You wanna bet?

1309
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:30,780
l bet you anything.

1310
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:33,540
- l'm gonna go get a cop.
- Fine, get a cop.

1311

Veyisromam veyisnaseh...

- He's not coming.
- What do you mean he's not coming?

1354
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:54,060

01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:50,740
l wanted to take up that discussion
we were having.

1365
01:33:52,580 --> 01:33:53,580
l can't right now.

1366
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:57,300
About Abraham and lsaac.
You remember what you said?

1367
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:59,580
That lsaac actually died on Mount Moriah.

1368
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:02,740
l've been thinking.
Maybe you were right about that.

1369
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:07,700
You remember what you said?
That lsaac actually died on Mount Moriah.

1370
01:34:08,140 --> 01:34:09,540
l've been thinking.

1371
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:11,860
Maybe you were right about that.

1372
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:14,500
Died and then reborn...

1373
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:15,900
..in the world to come.

1374
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:19,340
You remember what you said?

1375
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:22,620
That lsaac actually died on Mount Moriah.

1376
01:34:23,940 --> 01:34:27,100
l've been thinking.
Maybe you were right about that.

1377
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:29,140
Died and then reborn...

1378
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:30,900
..in the world to come.

1379
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:32,740
Danny, stop.

1380
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:35,340
Where do you think you're going?

1381
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:38,220
Don't you know?

1382
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:41,020
There's nothing up there.

1383
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:46,340
(heavy footsteps continue)

1384
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:20,540
..your onIy son whom you Iove,
Isaac,...

1385
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:22,540
..and go unto the Iand of Moriah...

1386
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:26,780
..and offer him there as a sacrifice,
on a mountain that I wiII show you.

1387
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:29,580
So,...

1388
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:33,300
..I wiII show you.

1389
01:36:59,260 --> 01:37:01,300
It was a test of Abraham's faith,...

1390
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:03,740
..of his devotion to God.

1391
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:09,940
It's not about Abraham's faith.
It's about God's power.

1392
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:13,820
Abstraction.

1393
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:16,220
Obsessive abstraction.

1394
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:19,180
To kiII your own son.

1395
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:21,700
(echoing) Cos I'm everything or nothing.

1396
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:24,700
Or nothing.

1397
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:39,500
Jews?

1398
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:41,580
Judaism?

1399
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:48,020
They're stiII just Jews.

1400
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:50,340
Differences exist, of course.

1401
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:53,060
Right, but they're irreIevant.

1402
01:37:53,140 --> 01:37:57,340
He was born a Jew.
His Jewishness dominates everything.

1403
01:37:58,100 --> 01:37:59,700
Do you want to announce it?

1404
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:02,500
I wanna cut it out of the hearts...

1405
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,580
Can't escape it.

1406
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:06,860
Freud, Einstein, what have they given us?

1407
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:08,140
..can't hammer naiIs or pIough a fieId...

1408
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:09,820
They've defiIed sexuaIity.

1409
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:12,620
..can't hammer naiIs or pIough a fieId...
