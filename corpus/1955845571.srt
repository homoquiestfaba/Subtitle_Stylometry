What do you want
for your birthday?

110
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,592

- To my--
- No, not your toast.

112
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:52,664
- It's not your toast.
- [laughing]

- Escape room?
- Yep.

- Yeah.
- What is that?

136
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,026
You're locked in a room

137

one hour.

139

No, that sounds horrible.

That sounds really fun.

141
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,935
I've heard
it's the latest craze.

142
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,305
Remember that, um,
secret mask thing,

143
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,339
the<i> Macbeth</i> thing
in New York last year?

144
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,742
- That wasn't
an escape room.
- I know.

145
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,378
I'm just saying
it's the latest
underground thing.

146
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,579
They're popping up
everywhere.

147
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,349
I think Shakespeare
in any form is
so fucking boring.

148
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:20,718
- Yeah.
- I agree with you.

149
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,920
This won't be.
I promise.

150
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,257
What happens if we don't
figure it out in time?

151
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,626
We're trapped.

152
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,729

Hmm.

156
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,980
All right, I'm in.
Where is this room?

157

Ooo, exciting!
So how do we get there?

159
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,219

... come up with something
so adventurous?

163

Excuse me! What,
are you surprised?

174
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:38,396

about reservations.
- [groans]

At least I already
have plans.

Do you want me
to call you a cab?

183
00:11:56,182 --> 00:12:00,852
I'll get a ride.
You guys have fun.

184
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,856
- How you gonna get home?
- Oh, I'm not going home.

185
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,458
This girl's got
a sexy party to go to.

Ay, ay!

This is amazing.
Thank you.

- Okay, guys.

202
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,942
Gonna need
your cell phones, please.

[Christen] Yes.

206

Can't have you
looking up how
to solve a puzzle.

207
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,451
No help from anyone.

- Come on!
- No.

212
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,294
For an hour?

213
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,030
Come on,
what's the big deal?

214
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,031
As birthday ambassador,

215
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,834
I order all of you
to relinquish your phones.

216
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,502
Thank you.

Fuck it.

As you wish,
birthday ambassador.

221

[Conrad] All righty. One more.

222
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,323
- What?
- It's everyone or no one.

223
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,860
[sighs] Fine.

224
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,298
Proud of you, Anderson.

225
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,400
- Fuck off.
- [laughing]

226
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,035
- Ouch.
- Why is he so mean to me?

227
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,203
I love him and he's
so mean to me.

228
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,973
All right, guys, I'm also
going to need your wallets,

229
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,308
your purses, anything else
in your pockets.

230

And there's insurance
on this game and all,
right?

233
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,117
- I take full responsibility
for everything.
- Okay.

234
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:14,452
- Thank you, Conrad.
- You're welcome.

how long we've been
driving for?

00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,661
How could we,
when we can't see
anything?

245
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,162
[Tabby] Let's just
ask the driver.

[knocking]

247
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,941

Maybe it's not
supposed to open.

It's all part of it.

249
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,110
Christen, how'd you
find this place?

250
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,379
They're everywhere.
Hiding in plain sight.

251
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,214
What, is there
an escape room app?

252
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,050
You just tap
and sign up? What?

253
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,719
- [laughs] The Uber
of entrapment games?
- [Conrad laughs]

254
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,389
No, no app. No nothing
on the Internet.

255
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,926
Well, then
how'd you find it?

256
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:29,994
I got this.

257
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:39,070
What is<i> that?</i>

258
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,005
An invitation.

It's cute.

261
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,157
Yeah, but the question
is, who sent it?

262
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,426
I don't know.

263
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,263
But I know with all the research
I've been doing on escape rooms,

264
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,999
my name got on some list,

265
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:10,401
and this ended up
in my mailbox.

266
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,435
It's Morse code.

267
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:17,141
It spells G-A-M-E.

Yeah, that's awesome.

276

Well, I'm too buzzed
to care at this point
anyway, so...

288
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,145
- I'm so nervous.
- I got this, babe.

289
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,280
Ugh.

You're not wearing one?

Somebody's got to be
in charge.

300
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:57,374
Isn't that cheating?

301
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,711

Yeah, well,
it's obviously
not working.

It's a fucking puzzle.
There must be
another solution.

Okay, what did we do

Tabby, it's part of the game.
You gotta figure it out.

a reason they put

00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:45,676
Yeah, it's a clue.

00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:28,091
[clicking]

530
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,626
And the first clock
on the right hand side?

531
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,528
Uh, five.

532
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:35,398
Second one on the left?

533
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,334
Six.

534
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:41,872
And the last one
on the right.

535
00:30:41,907 --> 00:30:43,373
And eight.

536
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:54,885
- Shit.
- [Natasha sighs]

537
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,121
You did it. [laughs]

538
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,556
No problem.

539
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:03,326
- Wow, fashionable.
- Yeah.

540
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,395
We'll see.

541
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,130
¶

542
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,498
Guys.

543
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:15,305
[chuckles]

544
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,073
All right.

545
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:19,576
It works. [laughs]

546
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,012
- [cuff clicks]
- [sighs]

547
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,583
- [key clatters]
- [snorts, laughs]

548
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:35,091
Hey, there's a card here.

549
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,326
Wonder what
it's doing there.

550
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:40,597
- Is it a piece to a puzzle?
- I don't know.

551
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:41,665
Yeah...

552
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,101
[Natasha sighs]

553
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,906
Is this-- Is this
how you took it out?

554
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,945
Now what?

555
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,150
Yikes.

556
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,985
Exactly.

557
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,254
Well, the only way out
is the exit door,

558
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,222
which I assume will open
when we win.

559
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,025
<i> If</i> we win.

560
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,395
Anderson. Come on.

561
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,065
We just killed
that first puzzle
without breaking a sweat.

562
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,033
Don't you want to win?

563
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,002
We're going to get
out of here in record time.
Just get on board.

564
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,071
All right. Lead the way,
birthday boy.

565
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,473
But how do you suspect
we're gonna find the others
if there are no doors?

566
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,542
It's all gotta be
part of the game.

567
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:28,979
¶

568
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:31,648
- What are you looking for?
- I don't know.

569
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,117
- [laughs]
- That narrows it down.

570
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,019
Oh, come on, Anderson.

571
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,555
There has to be something
that leads to the next thing.

572
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,390
You know, like a clue?

573
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,158
Oh, really?

574
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,328
So do you mind
enlightening me, then?

575
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,665
All right.

576
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,234
[sighs]

577
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,470
Okay, well,
how about these?

578
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:57,073
They're a series
of animal paintings
in a line.

579
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,743
So what?

580
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:02,112
So it could be a clue!
I don't know.

581
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,981
- Yes!
- [music playing]

582
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,990
[sighs]

583
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,227
I bet it's based on weight.
Take those off.

584
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:18,528
Oh, yeah.

585
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,669
It's the food chain.

586
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,071
Brilliant.
Trade me.

587
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,043
Rabbit.

588
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:36,380
- Fox.
- Coyote.

589
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,784
- [machinery whirring]
- Whoa. What?

590
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,753
[Natasha laughs]

591
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,491
[scoffs]

592
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:51,094
[sighs]
Seriously?

593
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,130
Slackers.

594
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,799
Typical.

595
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,604
Hi. Oh, yeah?

596
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,373
- You guys busy?
- [Natasha] Hmm?

597
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,574
We can't hear you.

598
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:08,178
We can't hear you.

599
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,251
We... we can't
hear you.

600
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,821
Oh, my God.

601
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,123
It's like he doesn't know
it's my sister.

602
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:21,725
[sighs]

603
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,864
Hey, where do you think
that door leads to?

604
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,233
Well, it looks
like it's connected
to the other room.

605
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:31,801
But there is no door
in the other room.

606
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:33,035
I<i> know</i> that,

607
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,505
but you're telling me
that doesn't look
like it's connected?

608
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,773
Oh, it's definitely
connected.

609
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,408
¶

610
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:53,790
What're you doing?

611
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,530
[gasps]

612
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,299
- Oh!
- Whoa!

613
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:06,503
[Tyler] Wow. Fuck.

614
00:35:06,538 --> 00:35:09,673
Ah. [grunts]

615
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,578
Oh, so there<i> was</i> a door.

616
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:22,419
Here.

617
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,155
[sighs]

618
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:29,159
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

619
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,163
All right, let's
get rid of these clocks.

620
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,303
Okay, so where's the key?

621
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,542
How about the ones
that unlocked the ropes?

622
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,511
Ah. Yeah.

623
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:01,158
Stop it.

624
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,762
What? Come on.

625
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,837
There's no way
this is gonna fit.

626
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:15,972
[scoffs]
Nice.

627
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,308
It was your fucking idea.

628
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:19,842
Look, there's gotta be
a key here somewhere,

629
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,211
let's just find it.

630
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:24,381
Oh, my God.

631
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,386
- Would you just...
- [Tyler] God.

632
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,401
Hey, hey, look for a clock
that only has a minute hand.

633
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:49,572
- Why?
- Just fucking do it,
Anderson.

634
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:52,875
Okay.
Here, got it.

635
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:57,347
This clock only has
a minute hand.

636
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:02,986
- Okay.
- What the hell is up
with these clocks?

637
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,022
Here, here, here.

638
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,591
All right,
what the fuck?

639
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:09,759
[clock clatters]

640
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,263
If I...

641
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:26,542
[clicks]

642
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,510
Hm.

643
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,484
- That's impressive.
- Very impressive.

644
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,420

00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,628
Here, help me.

[grunts]

648
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:52,335
- Ah?
- Yes!

649
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,672
Yeah! Hey, guys.
[laughs]

650
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:56,973
- You're my hero.
Thank you.
- Hey.

651
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,207
You guys rescued us.

652
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,643
Yeah, any longer
and someone's pants'd
be on the floor.

653
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:03,413
- She's wearing a skirt.
- That is correct.

654
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,781
- Oh, gross.
- [laughs]

655

[TVs powering up]

656
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,418
What the fuck?

00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:12,055
¶

658
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,657
Uh...

659
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,545
[Tabby] Is that Christen?

660
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,480
Oh, my God!

661
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,484
Where is she?

662
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,853
Yeah, things
just got weird.

663
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:47,790
Wow.

664
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,359
What?

665
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:54,097
It's all part of the game.

666
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,966
¶

667
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:01,137
[laughs] This is
fucking cool.

668
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,440
Look, look.
We have 41 minutes
to rescue Christen.

669
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,542
That's the game.

670
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:12,715
Christen said
we had an hour.

671
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,550
Well, the timer
must have started
when we got here.

672
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,953
It was probably me.
I flipped the switch
over there.

673
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,488
Oh.

674
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,458
Why isn't she
in here with us?

675
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,560
Why would she lock herself
in a cage somewhere?

676
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,996
I don't know, Anderson.
That's what we have
to figure out.

677
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,436
Fine.
Whatever.

678
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:36,005
At least we know
what we're playing for
now, right?

679
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,907
Bingo. That's
the can-do attitude

680
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,075
we like to hear
from you, Anderson.

681
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,177
Now, time is of the essence.

682
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,446
So, it's a good thing
I know exactly
what we have to do next.

683
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,614
Check it out.

684
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:50,887
What happened?

685
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:52,121
What do you mean?

686
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:53,823
Weren't there squares
with letters on them
right here?

687
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,691
Oh, yeah,
there were.

688
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,693
Yeah, but they were
there the whole time.

689
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,961
Are you sure
about that?

690
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,295
'Cause you guys
were just sucking
a whole bunch of face.

691
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:04,767
Yeah, well, when was
the last time you two
sucked face? Huh?

692
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,536
Look, as soon
as we got out
of the room,

693
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,005
it must have
disappeared.

694
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,974
It's probably
the door. Huh?

695
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,546
- [hisses]
- [beeps]

696
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:17,580
Hey.

697
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:22,585
Wait!
Shut it again.

698
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,926
[Tabby] Oh, wow, I bet
you have to spell
something.

699
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,862
- Yeah, but what?
- [Tyler exhales]

700
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,831
There's got to be
something.

701
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:41,170
Oh, that--
What the fuck is that?

702
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,506
[laughter]

703
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:44,640
Nice.

704
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,909
Was that thing
strapped to your junk?

705
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,110
It sure was.

706
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:50,146
- She released the Kraken.
- Oh!

707
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:53,516
- [laughter]
- Well, I'm not getting it.

708
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,586
- Getting what?
- It's another card.

709
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,622
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

710
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:00,790
Fuck it.

711
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,393
Ugh.

712
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,529
Guys, come on.
It was on the outside
of my pants.

713
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,231
He's clean.
I would know.

714
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:09,866
Excellent.

715
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:12,001
Well, I don't see
any other clues here,

716
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:15,004
so let's keep focused.
[claps and snaps fingers]

717
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,674
- Go. Go, go, go.
- Yeah.

718
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,643
¶

719
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:33,556
Well, it obviously
wants us to spell
something,

720
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,558
- so...
- How big a word?

721
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,995
- Nine letters?
- Nine letters?
Fuck, big word.

722
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:46,102
It's like an answer
to a crossword puzzle.

723
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,504
Oh, you love
crossword puzzles.

724
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:50,974
- He does.
- [Tabby chuckles]

725
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:57,079
And the answer is
in one of these newspapers.

726
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,047
Yes.

727
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:03,653
We don't have time
to go through all of these.

728
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:06,656
[Conrad] All right,
some of us look
for crosswords

729
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,657
while the others
look for clues.

730
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:08,891
You know,
get a system going.

731
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:09,959
That's gonna
take forever.

732
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,126
<i> There has to be</i>
<i> some kind of order.</i>

733
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:14,097
<i> Oh, what if there's</i>
<i> a clue in a headline?</i>

734
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,768
Well, theme in this one
is dead celebrities,
if that helps.

735
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:21,237
Well, did any of them
die on today's date?

736
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,140
Maybe that's
a fucking clue.

737
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,142
The dates.

738
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:27,844
That's actually
not a bad idea.

739
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,147
Nice, Christen.

740
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:32,148
My birthday.

741
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,684
- Look for today's date
30 years ago.
- Yes.

742
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,653
¶

743
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,725
[sighs] This stack
is all 1990s.

744
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,962
'70s.

745
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,363
- Oh! I got the '80s.
- [Conrad laughs]

746
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,999
- [Tyler] Perfect.
- Yes!

747
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,768
Okay...

748
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:58,608
All right, who's got
October 13th?

749
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,819
Ah, got it.

750
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:10,920
Yes, right here.

751
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,258
That's it.

752
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,861
All right,
it wants one word.

753
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,763
- [Conrad] All right,
how many letters?
- Nine.

754
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:24,066
- Nice.
- All right, the clue is...

755
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,636
"narcissistic notes."

756
00:43:28,873 --> 00:43:30,773
Interesting.

757
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:32,308
I'm glad we got
an easy one.

758
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:41,183
All right, well,
uh, shut me in the room

759
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:42,752
and I'll put in words
until I figure it out.

760
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:43,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

761
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:46,055
We started in there.
Let us take this one.

762
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,723
Tyler.

763
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:48,657
Conrad, this
is gonna involve

764
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:50,192
some quick
problem-solving
on the fly

765
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,128
and I'm not really sure
that's your forte.

766
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:54,230
Whoa, whoa.

767
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,432
What?

768
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,735
You can let someone else
do something, Tyler.

769
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:02,305
All right.

770
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:05,808
All right.

771
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,810
[gasps]
Oh! I got it.

772
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,647
"Egomaniac."

773
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:15,451
Actually,
that could work.

774
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,420
Yes.

775
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:21,691
[hissing]

776
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,265
[Tyler sighs]

777
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,233
Well...

778
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:37,807
[tones playing]

779
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,942
[exhales sharply]
Damn it.

780
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,845
Narcissistic notes.

781
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,782
Something about
letters... memos.

782
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:47,817
Ego's memos.

783
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,251
That has an apostrophe.

784
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:52,722
- So?
- So it's definitely
not the answer.

785
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:59,395
Oh. What if note isn't to do
with something written?

786
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,830
What'd you mean?

787
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,099
Like a musical note?

788
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,067
Like what is
a narcissistic's song?

789
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:08,204
[Conrad laughs]
Oh, looks like Anderson
needs a hug.

790
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:10,406
[Tabby] Oh, what about
egotistic?

791
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,407
[Conrad] Yeah, I'll try it.

792
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:13,175
[gasps] Oh!

793
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,511
What is Carly Simon's
"You're So Vain"?

794
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,146
That definitely won't fit.

795
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,849
Also, this isn't
<i> Jeopardy,</i> so...

796
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:23,219
Well, you come up
with something,
smart guy.

797
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:25,187
Whatever it is,
it's your theme song.

798
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,421
- What did you say?
- Huh?

799
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,892
Nothing, just that
my wife is stuck up
and she doesn't know--

800
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:31,194
- No, not that.
- I love you.

801
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,502
Try this.

802
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:41,203
T.

803
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,373
- T? Okay, T.
- Yes.

804
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:49,145
- H.
- H.

805
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,314
- E.
- E.

806
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:56,285
M. E.

807
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:58,755
[no audible dialogue]

808
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,759
Theme song.

809
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,394
- Theme song.
- A-B-C-D-E-F--

810
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,571
- [beeps]
- Yes!

811
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,540
- [gasps]
- Yes!

812
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:19,408
Yes! [laughs]

813
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,843
<i> Ha!</i>

814
00:46:20,878 --> 00:46:22,512
[exhales]

815
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:26,516
Nice. I'll go
let 'em out.

816
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:34,824
- If they<i> want</i> to get out.
- I'll never
get used to that.

817
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,293
Oh, who's the protective
big brother?

818
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:38,461
Stop.

819
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:42,565
I love how when you pretend
to have a conscience...

820
00:46:44,101 --> 00:46:46,936
I said fucking stop!
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

821
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,071

823
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:10,860
Hey! Fuck!

824
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,437
What's wrong?

825
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:23,172
The key broke off
in the fucking door.

826
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:24,106
What do you mean it broke?

827
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:27,610
I tried to open it
and it wouldn't open.

828
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:30,446
- Damn it.
- You disappoint me.

829
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:33,115
- Really, Anderson?
- [sighs] Jesus.

830
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,383
I don't see--

831
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,920
That's a little much.

You're gonna have to sit tight

how to get you out.

838
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,247
Wait.

839

[gas hissing]

841
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:25,000
It's all part
of the game, right?

842
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,469
Yeah. That's weird.

843
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:28,670
What?

844
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:31,674
We solved the puzzle.
Why would the door
close again?

845
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:32,675
Well, maybe--

846
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:37,713
maybe there's something else
that we have to do?

847
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,448
That doesn't make sense.

848
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,220
Wait.

What did you do?

898
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:19,168
I didn't--

899
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:23,772
I didn't do anything.

900
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,510
It locked on its own!

901
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,279
I-I-I tried to open it.

902
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:33,182
No, you fucked it up
and look what happened.

It's real.

What are you talking about?
Of c-- of course...

Why would Christen
bring us here?

916

Christen's
in trouble, too.

917
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:57,966
Then why the fuck
isn't she in the room
with us?

918
00:53:58,001 --> 00:54:00,502
She's locked
in a fucking cage,
Anderson!

919
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,005
Christ.

920
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:09,444
It's not a game.

What? So--
so we're trapped?

00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:29,498
There's no puzzle
to get us out of here?

00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:31,600
Fuck these puzzles!

All these rooms
are enclosed.

932
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,453
Yeah. We figured that out
a long time ago.

933
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:54,290
- What are you getting at?
- Which means there must be
some sort of ventilation.

934
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:10,072
Here!

935
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,710

Do you want
to get out of here?

941
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,431
Did you see
what just happened
to Conrad and Tabby?

942
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,833
There's got to be
another way
to open up the door.

943
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:39,868
Do you really want
to wait around
and figure it out?

944
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,503
What if there is
no way to open the door?

945
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:42,637
What if it's
just a matter of time

946
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,806
until this entire place
fills up with more acid fog

947

Anderson?
