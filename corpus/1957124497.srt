1
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:08,941
Tim:<i> I'm running</i>
<i> for San Bernardino</i>

2
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:10,809
<i> District Attorney.</i>

3
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:12,878
Yeah.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,313
I'm coming out here.

5
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:17,249
I'm a one-man band,
meeting the businesses,

6
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,350
<i> talking to voters,</i>

7
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,020
<i> and getting the word out</i>
<i> about my candidacy.</i>

8
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:25,424
Yes, for District Attorney.
I've said that three times now.

9
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:30,129
I'm not that corrupt,
Washington-style,

10
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:34,700
swamp-style...
District Attorney.

11
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:42,174
Look, I'm strong on crime.

12
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,544
I'm strong on crime.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,548
I'm him! I don't have a beard.
I...

14
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,883
He doesn't have a beard in this.

15
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:55,487
This is me. Yeah. I am me.
I am... I just have a beard.

16
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,956
And I have sunglasses on. See?

17
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,591
That's a documentary crew
filming.

18
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:02,428
They're making a film
about my campaign.

19
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:03,762
See me?

20
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:04,863
That's me. Okay?

21
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:07,599
I just have a beard now
because we did a focus group

22
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:08,967
and people liked the beard.

23
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,403
Toni Newman says
the beard works.

24
00:01:12,807 --> 00:01:15,074
Well, Vincent Rosetti

25
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:17,209
and some other clown, Sandoval.

26
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,778
So, I'm third party.
Just look for Tim Heidecker.

27
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,280
If you have the Internet,
you can go

28
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:24,883
to timheideckerforda.com.

29
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:27,052
And I'm gonna bring change.

30
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,121
All right?

31
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,186
All the... all the chips
are in on this,

32
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,721
sort of all the...

33
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:06,692
Everything's, um,
on the line here.

34
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:08,260
<i> And, you know, financially,</i>

35
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:12,131
<i> emotionally, sort of,</i>
<i> where I'm at...</i>

36
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,532
<i> this is sort of my...</i>

37
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:16,435
<i> I don't wanna say my last play,</i>
<i> but it's my big play.</i>

38
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,837
<i> I think we've put ourselves</i>
<i> in a perfect position</i>

39
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,206
<i> to really come from</i>
<i> out of nowhere,</i>

40
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,241
<i> be the outsider,</i>

41
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:23,942
<i> and I think we have</i>
<i> a very good chance</i>

42
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,010
<i> of winning, too.</i>

43
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,945
Tim: Oh, hi. I love dogs,
so this is perfect.

44
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,614
- Here's a...
- What are you running for?

45
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:30,149
- District Attorney.
- (dog barking)

46
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,185
Yeah, running against
Vincent Rosetti.

47
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,319
This is not a vote for me.

48
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,787
It's just to let me
get on the ballot.

49
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,656
I'm running
as an independent candidate.

50
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:42,728
<i> Get on the ballot is a big part</i>
<i> of my day, every day.</i>

51
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,165
At 15 signatures today,
so feeling pretty good.

52
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:49,001
<i> We're just basically taking it</i>
<i> street by street,</i>

53
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:51,069
<i> and it's been a slog.</i>

54
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:55,174
This is basically...
Fontana has been somewhere

55
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:59,011
where I've pretty much covered
the past three or four days.

56
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,146
<i> I'm on my own.</i>
<i> I'm a one-man band.</i>

57
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,281
<i> I've got Rialto to hit.</i>

58
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:05,317
<i> I've got Highland, Redlands,</i>
<i> Loma Linda,</i>

59
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,552
<i> the city of San Bernardino,</i>

60
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:08,687
<i> and we have to cover</i>
<i> all that area.</i>

61
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,190
It's 108 degrees out.

62
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,258
Ugh.

63
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,826
<i> You know, it's a lot of ground</i>
<i> to cover</i>

64
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,728
<i> 'cause, first of all,</i>
<i> most people aren't home.</i>

65
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,265
<i> Knocking on their door</i>
<i> on a Wednesday at 1:00 p.m...</i>

66
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:23,435
(clears throat)<i> You know,</i>
<i> I'm just... It's tough.</i>

67
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,705
<i> We need, you know,</i>
<i> something like 500 signatures</i>

68
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,574
<i> by next week.</i>

69
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,709
<i> But we're on track.</i>

70
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,378
We're very optimistic about it,
and that's...

71
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,646
Toni's cracking the whip on that

72
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,114
'cause if we're not on
the ballot,

73
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:39,985
then we're in real trouble.
You guys voters? You 18?

74
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:42,421
Do you vote? No?

75
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,957
I'm running
for District Attorney.

76
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,060
No, I'm running
for District Attorney.

77
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,127
Sort of like governor.

78
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,430
It's the way to change
your future.

79
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,499
All right, thank you. Be safe.

80
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,068
We have tremendous, you know,

81
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,136
support on the Internet
for the campaign,

82
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:02,107
and we have
a real movement happening.

83
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:06,411
Timheideckerforda.com.
It's a website.

84
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,479
And you can go on there

85
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,615
and fill out our petition
to get me on the ballot.

86
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:13,018
We need 500 signatures.
And I'm strong...

87
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,456
strong on crime, no uh...

88
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:18,790
no uh...

89
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,594
no more corruption, you know,
just getting Rosetti out.

90
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,496
So, pass that on to your dad,
all right?

91
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,498
My campaign chairman,
Toni Newman,

92
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,336
is very active in the campaign
and is doing...

93
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:34,873
Wearing many hats,
talking to media outlets

94
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:35,874
almost every day.

95
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:39,878
We got the Epson printer
basically printing out

96
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,980
whatever we need...

97
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,416
and then
for the bigger-print stuff,

98
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:50,455
we're going off, you know, to...
to Kinko's for that stuff.

99
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,724
This is our campaign
headquarters, really,

100
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,826
at this point,
until we get bigger offices.

101
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,497
To-do board, my strategy board,
I call it, my map.

102
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,898
You know, the hotel
treats us right.

103
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,001
We got a fridge
pretty much fully stocked,

104
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,469
whatever you need.

105
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,307
Uh, TV. It's basically
your classic...

106
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:09,975
bathroom, which is all I need.

107
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,345
That's work,
and then we have, sort of...

108
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:16,481
I don't want to say play,
but rest

109
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,517
and sort of a home life,

110
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,687
which was
one of the great reasons

111
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:23,422
I picked up on this idea

112
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:26,992
of relocating
to this beautiful hotel,

113
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,126
<i> is that I could...</i>

114
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,861
<i> I don't have to commute</i>
<i> or anything like that.</i>

115
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,264
<i> I can basically get right</i>
<i> to work as soon as I get up.</i>

116
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,399
<i> And then I'm just</i>
<i> in the community,</i>

117
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,368
<i> which is great.</i>
<i> It's not necessarily</i>

118
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,569
<i> about having... I don't need</i>

119
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,504
to have lived here
my entire life

120
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,173
to know the problems
and to understand

121
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,175
how to fix them.
There's crime everywhere,

122
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:46,712
and the same solution
applies to anywhere you live.

123
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:51,049
So, if I lived here,
which I do officially...

124
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,250
This is my legal residence.

125
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:56,154
This is where mail comes to,
when I need mail.

126
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:01,460
It's the same anywhere. And...

127
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,729
You know, if I need
to do a call in here,

128
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:04,796
I got a phone in here.

129
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:06,465
<i> You know, I wish</i>
<i> I had the volunteers,</i>

130
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:09,768
<i> but I also am glad and grateful</i>
<i> that there are...</i>

131
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,536
<i> that it's me</i>
<i> coming to the door.</i>

132
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,538
I'm not a career politician.
I'm an outsider.

133
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,574
Are you an attorney...
You're an attorney now?

134
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,975
I've practiced law, yeah,

135
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,578
- and I've represented myself.
- Okay.

136
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,246
I've had tremendous experience
in law,

137
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,281
- so there's no worries there.
- All right.

138
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,816
<i> 'Cause that's what's happening</i>
<i> with Rosetti,</i>

139
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,685
<i> is he's hiring</i>
<i> all these people, immigrants,</i>

140
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,888
people that probably
don't even have identification.

141
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,858
<i> Rosetti is paying them cash</i>
<i> to go out there</i>

142
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,860
<i> and basically offer cash</i>

143
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,329
if you vote for Rosetti
if I guaran...

144
00:06:37,331 --> 00:06:38,530
So, they're buying votes.

145
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:44,302
My options were, really,
meet him again in civil court...

146
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:48,540
to prosecute him for the crime
he committed against me,

147
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,776
<i> which is</i>
<i> unlawful incrimination.</i>

148
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:52,611
I'd rather have you guys
in the driver's seat

149
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,980
than these rats here.
And they're liars.

150
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,481
And I don't know
what I did to them.

151
00:06:56,483 --> 00:07:01,420
I don't know what I did to them
that they're so upset with me.

152
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,655
man:<i> Tragedy struck today</i>
<i> as hundreds</i>

153
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,724
<i> of musical-festival attendees</i>
<i> fell ill</i>

154
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:09,428
<i> in what authorities are calling</i>
<i> a suspected drug overdose.</i>

155
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,630
<i> The San Bernardino County</i>
<i> Sheriff's Office</i>

156
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:13,932
<i> has launched an investigation</i>

157
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:17,235
<i> known as the Electric Sun</i>
<i> Desert Music Festival,</i>

158
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:20,705
<i>founded this year by musician</i>
<i>and entrepreneur Tim Heidecker.</i>

159
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:23,241
The court calls the People
of the State of California

160
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,744
versus
Timothy Richard Heidecker.

161
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,379
Defendant is charged with counts

162
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:30,081
one through 20
of second-degree felony murder.

163
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:33,852
Vincent: He filled the lungs
of his innocent victims

164
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:39,257
with a chemical cocktail.
These portable vaporizers...

165
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:42,928
contain a dangerous chemical...

166
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:47,532
known to Mr. Heidecker
to cause illness

167
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:50,001
and be potentially fatal
when inhaled.

168
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:53,138
And Mr. Heidecker,
he'll be representing himself

169
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,841
- in this matter.
- I'm being unjustly prosecuted

170
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,876
for crimes of which
I did not commit.

171
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:01,513
woman: Your daughter was 17
when she left you.

172
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:04,816
I would do anything
to have her back.

173
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,252
And that man over there
is responsible.

174
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:10,155
He is responsible
for me losing her.

175
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,090
No, but he disobeyed me!
It's my...

176
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:15,060
I'll fuck you up, Mark!
Believe me! I'll fuck you up!

177
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:20,098
I have never seen
such a heinous crime

178
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,802
and such a tragedy.
See that justice is done.

179
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:25,737
Convict this individual.

180
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:29,875
Madam Foreperson, has the jury
reached a verdict?

181
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:33,144
No, we were not able to reach
a unanimous decision.

182
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:36,548
This is a mistrial,
and we are adjourned.

183
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,150
Yes! Yes!

184
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:42,988
I thank God for the one juror,
really,

185
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,990
who is sort of the stopgap here

186
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:48,093
and created this
amazing verdict.

187
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,262
It is my first time being
a juror...

188
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,764
a lawyer and I've proven myself

189
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,901
to be basically unstoppable
at this point.

190
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:58,136
As far as the DA goes,
this Rosetti

191
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:02,140
has turned out to be a total rat
and a bad, bad guy.

192
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,276
And I don't know how
you find these people,

193
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,410
if you elect them or not,

194
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,012
but if you have elected them,
who knows?

195
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,180
maybe he'll have
some competition next time.

196
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:12,050
Fuck this! I'm done!
You hear me!

197
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,220
And I'm coming for you, Rosetti,
wherever the fuck you are!

198
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,255
I'm running
for District Attorney

199
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:21,293
of San Bernardino County.
Why? Because I'm a fighter,

200
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,528
and I know
what that county needs.

201
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,563
I already proved myself

202
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,431
that I am the best lawyer
there's ever...

203
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,799
I won that case fair and square.

204
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:31,269
I want to be your DA,
and I hope I have your vote.

205
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:39,544
Edward:<i> I retired</i>
<i> about three months ago.</i>

206
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,746
<i> I had a backlog</i>
<i> that I really felt</i>

207
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,881
<i>I was obligated to work through</i>

208
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:47,452
<i> and not pass off</i>
<i> onto any of my fellow judges.</i>

209
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,087
<i> But I have been winding down</i>

210
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,657
since not too long after
the Heidecker verdict.

211
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,160
I have to say that
in all my time on the bench,

212
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,494
I've never had a case like that.

213
00:09:56,496 --> 00:10:00,231
<i> Mr. Heidecker clearly had</i>
<i> no respect for decorum.</i>

214
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,300
Objection. Defendant
is intimidating this witness.

215
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,636
I am not intimidate...
I'll intimidate you.

216
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,705
- Believe me.
- Edward: Mr. Heidecker!

217
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:07,839
- I'm...
- Mr. Heidecker!

218
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,307
I'm warning you
that this is my...

219
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:11,009
I move to hold the defendant
in contempt.

220
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:14,512
- Judge, I promise
I'm going somewhere with this.
- Do you have a question to ask,

221
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,781
as opposed to an accusation
to make?

222
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,451
Frankly, he turned it
into a circus.

223
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,320
And I think we all bear
a responsibility

224
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:23,888
for allowing that to happen.

225
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,890
What a lot of people
don't understand

226
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:29,194
is that I had to allow
some of that to happen.

227
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:31,663
<i>I had a constitutional duty...</i>

228
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,933
<i> to allow Mr. Heidecker</i>
<i> to represent himself</i>

229
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:39,270
and to let him
do the best he could.

230
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,840
So, I think a lot
of the criticism

231
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:45,176
that's been leveled against me
is simply ignorant.

232
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,277
<i> People don't understand</i>

233
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,246
<i> that that's a very</i>
<i> different situation.</i>

234
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,815
From the volume of hate mail
I received

235
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,419
from people who were irate
about that verdict,

236
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,788
my perception is that...

237
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,357
in large sections
of San Bernardino County,

238
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,293
Mr. Heidecker
is persona non grata.

239
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,497
He is perceived as a charlatan.

240
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:09,868
He's perceived as a murderer

241
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,870
who got away with it...

242
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,438
um...

243
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,807
by manipulating the system.

244
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,444
Yes, one juror held out,
but as far as the election goes,

245
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,346
I take great comfort
from the fact

246
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,581
that 11 out of 12...

247
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,718
were convinced
beyond a reasonable doubt...

248
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,789
that he was guilty of at least
second-degree felony murder.

249
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:35,093
So, if 11 out of 12 eligible
voters in San Bernardino County

250
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,528
believe that...

251
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,064
he doesn't have a chance.

252
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,031
Josh:

253
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,867
Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes.

254
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,502
Josh:

255
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:48,306
Well, you know, this is, uh...

256
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,476
this is the most serious race
I've run in.

257
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:56,514
You don't want guys that have
sort of career politicians.

258
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,283
I think that's my point,
is you don't want...

259
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,151
you want an outsider to come in
and shake things up

260
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,354
because San Bernardino
has gotten to be so corrupt.

261
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:07,792
And the crime has skyrocketed.
We have crime stats here.

262
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:09,227
All these numbers,
if you see the...

263
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,529
You can almost look
from a 30,000-foot view,

264
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:15,467
you see that it's just up, up,
up, and that's all crime.

265
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:19,304
You know, really a lot
of big problems here, which...

266
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,338
We want to be realistic,

267
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,576
but I'd say a 100 percent
elimination of crime...

268
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:28,413
is our goal. And that's,
I think, very doable.

269
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:33,218
We are off to one of my
favorite family restaurants

270
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,353
in the San Bernardino County.

271
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:39,224
And we're gonna be meeting
with my campaign chairman,

272
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,526
Toni Newman.
Really a brilliant strategist,

273
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:46,164
a brilliant political mind
who knows the issues

274
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,933
and believes in me
as a candidate,

275
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,468
and, frankly, I...

276
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,772
you know, sees me going
far, far, far beyond

277
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:57,041
simply, District Attorney.

278
00:12:57,043 --> 00:13:01,646
You know, national office,
national positions.

279
00:13:02,716 --> 00:13:04,616
So, we'll...

280
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:07,685
- (watch chimes)
- On my way.

281
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,389
On...

282
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,057
(watch dings)

283
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,260
On...

284
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:19,330
- (watch dings)
- Okay.

285
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,834
We'll be there in five minutes.

286
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,602
- (bell chimes)
- How you doing?

287
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,404
- Mel: Good. Hi. How are you?
- Tim: Good. How are you?

288
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,872
- I'm Tim Heidecker.
- Tim, nice to meet you.

289
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:29,707
Yeah.
Running for District Attorney.

290
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,876
How's it going? Nice to see you.

291
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,244
<i> -</i> woman:<i> Hola.</i>
- How you doing?

292
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,946
I'm Tim Heidecker.
Nice to meet you.

293
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:38,049
Running for District Attorney.
Y'all registered voters, I hope?

294
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,751
I'm not wasting my time
over here?

295
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:41,419
- man: Absolutely.
- Great.

296
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:42,453
Sorry I'm late.

297
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,722
- Well...
- This is Toni Newman,

298
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:48,927
my campaign chairm...
chairwoman, chairman, whatever.

299
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,496
I come
from an advertising background,

300
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,564
outside advertising.

301
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:56,668
I've got about 17, 20 years
in advertising, so...

302
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,036
Tim: Which is ultimately...

303
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:00,038
You were telling me this,
that a campaign, a candidate,

304
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,206
is essentially a product, is...

305
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,441
Why don't you
bring me up to speed?

306
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:05,710
Well, you know,
I've just been out canvassing.

307
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,880
I mean, I'm getting signatures
at a rate that concerns me

308
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:10,782
because it's not the rate
that is gonna get us

309
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:13,484
to where we need to be,
according to you.

310
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,719
Well, we can't get on the ballot

311
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,487
- if we don't have
enough signatures.
- I understand.

312
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:18,723
So we need to find a way to...

313
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,925
- We need
to figure out something.
- Well, let's just

314
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,793
put that aside.

315
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,094
Let's put that
on the back burner.

316
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,964
Can we get...
Yeah, we're very hungry.

317
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,866
I have to try
those peanut butter...

318
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:30,134
that peanut butter
chocolate banana pie.

319
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,836
You know, just sort of
the classic omelet.

320
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,239
- What's the classic omelet?
- waitress: Do you want to do
the four and 20 omelet?

321
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,207
- Yeah, let's do that.
That sounds great.
- waitress: Sure.

322
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,142
What kind of wine
do you have, a red wine?

323
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,778
waitress: Red? We have a Merlot.
We have Cabernet.

324
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,081
- We have Pinot Noir.
- Pinot?

325
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,582
- Thank you so much.
- waitress: Mm-hmm.

326
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,252
Are you registered to vote
in the area?

327
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,853
- waitress: Not in this area.
- Tim: Okay.

328
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:52,490
'Cause I felt like we had
a connection from the beginning.

329
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,458
Tim: Oh, yeah.

330
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,326
- And I felt like...
- Tim: That was there.

331
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:56,394
...we should be a team,

332
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:00,899
that we could put things back
in their proper place.

333
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,101
Tim: Yeah, because you're
from this area,

334
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,335
so you know even more than I do.

335
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:07,205
- Yes, I'm from San Bernardino.
- And you were talking to me

336
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,873
about the demographics change.

337
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,509
It's not the same city
that I grew up in.

338
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,144
- It's absolutely changed.
- Mm-hmm.

339
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:15,079
- And it's not safe anymore.
- No.

340
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,849
And you know exactly
what I'm talking about...

341
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:21,452
- don't you?
- Yeah. Well, I think we all do.

342
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:22,654
Oh, thank you.

343
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,088
- Tim: That's a big pour.
- Wow.

344
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,724
And you have shown me
just unbelievable graphics that

345
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:30,662
you've pulled off the Internet,
unbelievable stats that,

346
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:34,065
when you look
at the Hispanic population,

347
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,800
- Asian population...
- Toni: I mean, you could look

348
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,302
through the newspaper,
and you can...

349
00:15:37,304 --> 00:15:39,737
- Tim: You see it, yeah.
- ...see the crime.

350
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:42,674
I feel like a minority
in my own city,

351
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:46,044
- to be quite honest with you.
- That's kind of interesting.

352
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,278
You can't be safe there anymore.

353
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,448
And Rosetti is behind
a lot of this.

354
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,750
It's sort of like this
kind of three-stage thing.

355
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,118
It's, "We have a rat problem."

356
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,620
And I wish you'd give me
a pen that works.

357
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,989
Here, let me give you
another one. "Get him out."

358
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:00,525
- So, once you get
into office...
- Tim: Well, yeah,

359
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:01,592
but before that,

360
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,461
acknowledge that we have
a rat problem.

361
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,697
So, we have a rat problem.
That's one.

362
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,467
- Then we set the rat trap.
- Set the trap.

363
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,171
Tim: So, that's... Yeah,
we have a rat problem.

364
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,138
Set the rat trap.

365
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,873
waitress: There we go.
Food coming in.

366
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,809
Tim: But I would like
more specifics.

367
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,444
In terms of setting the trap,

368
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,346
we need to force him
into the corner

369
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:26,150
to come to the debate,
to come to the town hall debate.

370
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,386
Toni: Yeah, but that's gonna be
difficult to do.

371
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,188
He's not gonna want to interact
with you.

372
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,622
- He's already...
- Well, of course,

373
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,992
because he knows
he would lose the debate,

374
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,193
just like he lost in court.

375
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,895
I love that, sort of,
Rocky Balboa,

376
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,630
you know,
underdog position to be in.

377
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,332
I don't think there's
a better position to be in,

378
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,134
especially when you're fighting
up against the powers

379
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,902
that be of Rosetti
and the machine,

380
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,537
the San Bernardino machine,

381
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:50,942
which includes people like
Symczyk, who is in that...

382
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:54,412
is part of that, you know...

383
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:55,680
He's the other one. He retired.

384
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,950
He got out 'cause he knew
that he ran a kangaroo court.

385
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,818
- Toni: But keep in mind...
- You did hear that, right?

386
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,754
- He retired. He's done.
- Toni: I did hear it.
He's done.

387
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:04,789
- Tim: He's done.
He got laughed out.
- Toni: He's washed up.

388
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,657
- I know.
- Tim: He got laughed out
of the courtroom.

389
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,393
I heard about it.
We were a team then.

390
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,495
You didn't know it.
You didn't know me.

391
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:11,763
This is sort of the big reveal.

392
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:13,197
- I was on the jury...
- Tim: Mm-hmm.

393
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,300
...and thanks to me,
I got him off.

394
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:21,139
And I got a phone call kind of
out of the blue from Toni.

395
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:23,141
We met up,
and it was a long lunch,

396
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,176
a lot of gratefulness
coming from me,

397
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:29,113
a lot of respect for you
and your mind.

398
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:31,783
I knew that Tim was a guy
that was gonna

399
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:33,184
- help me...
- Hmm.

400
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,218
...accomplish the change

401
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,021
that I know
that San Bernardino needs.

402
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,523
And I saw the corruption
in Rosetti.

403
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,059
As soon as that man opened
his mouth, I could see it.

404
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,394
The campaign sort of
began then, didn't it?

405
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,063
- Toni: Kind of, yeah.
- I want to know

406
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,264
where the pie is.

407
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,499
Did we forget about the pie?

408
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,735
waitress: Do you want them now
or to go?

409
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,669
Well, no, now.

410
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,104
- Toni: He wants it now.
- I mean, I could eat it

411
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:55,106
- with the breakfast.
- Okay.

412
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,110
Tim: At some point soon,

413
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:02,046
we need to kind of address
the elephant in the room

414
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,982
and start getting
some kind of staff going.

415
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:08,886
I've got some flags out there
and working with people.

416
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,388
- Tim: Yeah.
- It's not easy

417
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,422
to get money, though.

418
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,723
- I mean, we're...
- Toni: I know.

419
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:13,925
We're less than two weeks out.

420
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,493
Toni: But we don't have
the signatures, Tim.

421
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:16,727
Once we get the signatures,

422
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,563
I think people will be
more apt to give money

423
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,665
because they know
that you're on the ballot.

424
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,166
Tim: Okay, well,
we're talking in circles

425
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:24,368
because we need money
to get the volunteers

426
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,536
so we can get the signatures.

427
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:26,737
But this is what it is, folks.

428
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,906
I mean, this is the grind
of the campaign.

429
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,309
Right now we're operating
on a shoestring budget.

430
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:34,712
Uh, a lot of it's coming out
of my personal account.

431
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,415
And Toni's contributed some.

432
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:41,252
We don't want that corrupt,
dark money...

433
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,921
because then I become a puppet
of those people.

434
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:47,425
We would love the big bucks
through small donations,

435
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:50,061
is sort of our dream.
Or one big donor.

436
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:52,763
- waitress: There's the pie.
- Thank you. And I do apologize.

437
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,433
We're just on
a rough schedule today.

438
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:56,534
Let's get a shot of this.

439
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,403
I mean, this is
San Bernardino right here.

440
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,772
- Toni:<i> Is that awesome?</i>
- Tim:<i> This is how it goes.</i>

441
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,674
You have to create
your own momentum.

442
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,910
You have to create
your own media, really.

443
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:08,346
- Okay. Hi. This is Tim.
<i> - Yes, I know.</i>

444
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,315
Toni:<i> Tim Heidecker.</i>
<i> I wanted to introduce you.</i>

445
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,651
<i> - Go ahead, Tim.</i>
<i> - Hi, everybody.</i>

446
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,719
<i> This is Tim Heidecker,</i>

447
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:17,188
<i> running for District Attorney</i>
<i> for San Bernardino.</i>

448
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,158
<i> I'm sitting here at one of</i>
<i> my favorite family restaurants</i>

449
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,459
<i> in San Bernardino County,</i>

450
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:25,062

00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,531
<i> chocolate</i>
<i> peanut butter apple...</i>

452
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,534
<i> or chocolate peanut butter</i>
<i> banana pie.</i>

453
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:33,204
<i> Doesn't that look good?</i>
<i> So, let's take a bite.</i>

454
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,206
- Toni:<i> Yum. How is it?</i>
<i> - Mm!</i>

455
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,476
- Toni:<i> Is it amazing?</i>
<i> - I'm gonna come back for this.</i>

456
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:39,844
<i>This is a great piece of pie.</i>

457
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,013
-<i> I look forward</i>
<i> to meeting with you...</i>
- Toni:<i> What are you gonna</i>

458
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,315
<i> - do for the community...</i>
<i> - Don't interrupt the video.</i>

459
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:48,119
(indistinct chatter)

460
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,253
<i> I look forwarding to...</i>

461
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,955
<i> I look forward to taking a bite</i>

462
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,791

463

464
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:58,262
<i> Say no to Rosetti.</i>

465
00:19:58,264 --> 00:19:59,864
<i> We have a rat problem,</i>
<i> ladies and gentlemen.</i>

466
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,967
<i> I am here to exterminate it,</i>
<i> set the rat trap.</i>

467
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:06,103
<i> We want him out.</i>
<i> We want Rosetti out.</i>

468
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,106
<i> - Tim... go to timheidecker...</i>
- Perfect.

469
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,708
Put that up on Twitter
and Facebook

470
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,976
- on the site.
- Toni: I will.

471
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,445
How about we open
an Instagram account?

472
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:16,047
Tim: Well, yeah,
we should have that already.

473
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,149
Toni: GoFundMe, Instagram.
Facebook's up.

474
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:20,151
- I'll work on the billboards.
- Okay. All right.

475
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:21,919
- Toni: Okay?
- I think that's good.

476
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,688
- You got this?
- Toni: Yeah?

477
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,257
Get that, and we'll deal
with the details later.

478
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:29,126
I'll see you back at the...
at the office.

479
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,695
- Bye, Tim. Bye.
- Thank you so much.

480
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,563
- Toni: See you a little later.
- Tim: Okay. See you later.

481
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,632
And look for me,
Tim Heidecker for DA.

482
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:37,802
Mel? Could be a man
or a female, Mel.

483
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,137
- Mel: All right. See you.
- All right.

484
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:44,442
(indistinct chatter)

485
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:49,280
Gregg:

486
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:11,235
Josh:<i> And if you can</i>
<i> just count to three.</i>

487
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:15,206
- Three, two, one, action.
- Josh: A few more levels here.

488
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,440
If you could just
state your name

489
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,075
and what you had for breakfast.

490
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:21,112
Gregg Turkington
from<i> On Cinema at the Cinema</i>

491
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:26,250
and<i> Decker vs. Dracula</i>
and<i> Ant-Man,</i> and I...

492
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,719
Actually,
this is my breakfast, so...

493
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,321
Josh: So, tell me, Gregg,
how did you come

494
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:31,389
to meet Tim Heidecker?

495
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,923
How did you first
get involved with him?

496
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,659
Well, first I just wanted
to say you're probably wondering

497
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:38,629
why I chose this park
as a place to meet.

498
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,398
And it's actually
an interesting story.

499
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,068
This is kind of
a historic movie site.

500
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,337
Have you seen
the<i> Oh, God!</i> movie

501
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:49,006
with George Burns
and John Denver?

502
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,574
- Josh:
- In that spot,

503
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:54,178
Tracy throws a basket
from far away

504
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,981
and makes it perfectly,
and that's when Shingo thinks,

505
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,917
"Okay, she must be
affiliated with God,"

506
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,485
'cause she couldn't make
that shot otherwise.

507
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,355
So, that's where this... that's
exactly where this was filmed.

508
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:07,391
Josh: What's your relationship
with Tim Heidecker?

509
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:10,695
Well, it started out
just as a guest on the show

510
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:12,730
<i> On Cinema at the Cinema.</i>

511
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:15,833
(intro music playing)

512
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:17,968
Hi, everybody.
My name is Tim Heidecker.

513
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,638
And welcome to the first episode
of my new show,

514
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,239
<i> On Cinema at the Cinema.</i>

515
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,108
Congratulations
on the TV series.

516
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,177
Thanks very much.
This is our first episode,

517
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,745
so we're just sort of
working out the kinks

518
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,280
and having a lot of fun
doing it, as well.

519
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,449
Gregg:<i> But then I was bringing</i>
<i> so much expertise</i>

520
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:32,750
<i> to the show and stuff that,</i>

521
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:35,786
<i> after the first episode,</i>
<i> I think he realized,</i>

522
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,655
<i> "Why bring in different guests</i>
<i> each week?</i>

523
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,357
<i> Why not just have</i>
<i> a resident expert?"</i>

524
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,660
<i> And so I ended up taking</i>
<i> a bigger and bigger and bigger</i>

525
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:44,695
<i> and bigger and bigger role</i>
<i> in that until,</i>

526
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,865
<i> finally, that's why people</i>
<i> were tuning in to the show,</i>

527
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,901
was to get
that kind of movie expertise.

528
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:54,472
Hey, everybody. Welcome back
to another episode of<i> On Cinema.</i>

529
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,073
I'm your host, Tim Heidecker.

530
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,441
He got in over his head,
you know,

531
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,043
with some of his legal troubles
and things

532
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,212
and also the fact
that he doesn't know anything
about movies.

533
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:04,548
Prepping for the Electric Sun
Desert Music Festival

534
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,219
coming up in a couple...
this coming week, actually.

535
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,887
The good Dr. San and I

536
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,157
have developed
this very special blend,

537
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:14,925
TCH vape system.

538
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:19,397
We're gonna be giving away
as much as we can.

539
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,766
Josh:

540
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,334
- For murder, yeah.
- Josh: For murder.

541
00:23:23,336 --> 00:23:25,403
For murder. There were other
legal troubles before that.

542
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:28,773
In fact, one thing
that was never filed in court

543
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:31,242
was that he used my credit card

544
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,711
to fund the second season
of<i> Decker,</i>

545
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,012
which was shot in Hawaii.

546
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:39,083
And he owes me
just under 10,000 dollars.

547
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,085
Strangely enough,
he doesn't have money

548
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,286
to pay me back, but you see

549
00:23:42,288 --> 00:23:44,255
that he has money
for all these other schemes

550
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,356
that he comes up with.

551
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:48,359
These, like, protein-powder
type products

552
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:51,362
<i> or something that are supposed</i>
<i> to eliminate germs.</i>

553
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:53,330
He's got this awful band
called Dekkar,

554
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:56,400
<i> and they press up thousands</i>
<i> of these CDs, and they just...</i>

555
00:23:56,402 --> 00:23:58,169
<i> I think they take them</i>
<i> all to the dump...</i>

556
00:23:58,171 --> 00:24:00,805
I don't know,
because nobody wants them.

557
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,206
His ex-wife, Ayaka's family,

558
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,375
they financed this movie theater
which he burned down.

559
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:08,446
I hope he never sees this film
because if he sees this hat...

560
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:09,713
he's gonna lose it.

561
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,115
He's gonna get so angry
at you guys

562
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,351
'cause he doesn't allow people
to wear movie hats.

563
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,253
Mark, who's a good friend
of mine,

564
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,988
<i> who's also a movie buff,</i>

565
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,224
<i> lost a lot of oxygen</i>
<i> to the brain,</i>

566
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:21,358
<i> so he was a vegetable.</i>

567
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,761
<i> And we thought he was dead,</i>
<i> but he wasn't dead.</i>

568
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,629
<i>He's alive, but he's in a coma,</i>

569
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,666
and it's all because Tim
didn't get real scuba equipment.

570
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:31,268
He thought there were only
three<i> Jaws</i> movies,

571
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,837
and I had to let him know
there were more.

572
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,606
He's on Twitter saying
that there's gonna be

573
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:36,841
a movie called<i> Whale Man.</i>

574
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:39,343
<i> And if you were gonna</i>
<i> make a movie about a whale,</i>

575
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:41,045
you would do a Moby Dick movie,

576
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:42,580
which is already
a successful franchise.

577
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:48,619
And he says no vaccines. Well,
then little Tom Cruise Jr. died.

578
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,254
<i> And, you know,</i>

579
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:51,722
<i> it doesn't faze Tim any,</i>
<i> though.</i>

580
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,390
He's right back
with his latest scheme.

581
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:57,895
He's running for District
Attorney, which is not...

582
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,498
not gonna really happen
because he's not a lawyer.

583
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,566
He doesn't live
in San Bernardino.

584
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:08,172
Have you seen a movie from 1976
starring Dean Jones

585
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,608
called<i> The Shaggy DA?</i>

586
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:11,442
Josh:

587
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:13,777
You should see this movie.
It's a very funny movie.

588
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,714
The character of Dean Jones...
(clears throat)

589
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:19,083
...is running for DA, okay?

590
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:21,752
And he has a secret he wants
to keep from the voters,

591
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:25,122
and the secret is,
he keeps turning into a dog.

592
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,525
You could almost say Tim's...

593
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:30,928
his whole campaign
is an unofficial remake

594
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,996
of<i> The Shaggy DA</i>

595
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:34,265
because he keeps turning into
a dog in front of the voters,

596
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:37,434
except not a dog, more of,
a murderer or an arsonist

597
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:40,971
or he's unmasked as somebody
who doesn't know anything
about movies

598
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:44,108
or he doesn't know anything
about the law or what have you.

599
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,979
<i> The Garbage Pail Kids Movie</i>
from 1987 with Anthony Newley...

600
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,815
- was actually also shot
in this park.
- (cellphone chimes)

601
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,150
Hold on.

602
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:01,959
All right, I got to get going.
Um...

603
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,264
Actually...

604
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:10,401
if you guys want to come along
and see something that...

605
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,069
in light of what
we've been talking about,

606
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,104
I think you'd find
very interesting.

607
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:17,441
My source said
it's just past the mailbox.

608
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,145
Okay. Here we go.

609
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,083
See, these are children's films,

610
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,218
so that's not of any use
to the archives,

611
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,956
but this is a sealed copy
of<i> Breakfast at Tiffany's,</i>

612
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:34,625
which actually won
two Academy Awards,

613
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:37,461
including Best Picture
and Best Actress.

614
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:40,197
<i> Bringing Down the House</i> with
Steve Martin and Queen Latifah.

615
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:45,402
This is a great popcorn classic,
one of the funniest movies ever.

616
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,373
A hundred and five minutes.

617
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:53,177
This is an audiobook.
It does not belong here.

618
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:54,244
Onto the next location.

619
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,846
<i> This is the kind of thing</i>
<i> that Tim,</i>

620
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:57,481
<i> since that's what</i>
<i> your film's about...</i>

621
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,016
this is the kind of thing
he would never do.

622
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:00,451
He doesn't really care
about movies.

623
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:01,952
You guys know where
to get in touch with me

624
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,655
if you want to discuss
any of this further,

625
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:08,158
or come by and just film
at the VFA.

626
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,394
Tim:<i> Call...</i>

627
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:15,232
- Call Gregg Turkington.
- (watch dings)

628
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:17,501
- (watch dings)
- Come on!

629
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,103
It's Tim Heidecker.
I just got word

630
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:22,339
that a filmmaker that's been
following me around, Josh.

631
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,941
Has... you contacted him
and you've been

632
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,777
speaking with him?
Is that right?

633
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,880
Gregg:

634
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:33,651
Hey, Gregg, stay the fuck
out of my movie, okay?

635
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:34,952
Nobody wants
to hear from you.

636
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:37,154
This is about
my political career.

637
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,355
This has nothing to do with you.

638
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,290
It has nothing to do
with your fucking movies.

639
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,091
Gregg:

640
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:42,593
Well, what are you
talking to him about?

641
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:45,496
What the hell does he
have to do with you?

642
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:49,600
Gregg:

643
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:52,436
Well, stay the fuck
away from Josh.

644
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:55,906
Stay away from his fucking crew,
stay away from me,

645
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,574
and you stay... get...

646
00:27:57,576 --> 00:27:59,043
Gregg:

647
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,744
They are not... No.
That is not...

648
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,980
You're lying to me.
That's not what Josh said.

649
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:04,982
He said that you wanted
to talk to him about...

650
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:07,685
- You... you...
- Gregg:

651
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:09,386
Gregg:

652
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,921
No. Stay out of my life.

653
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:13,824
- Good luck with the... good...
- Gregg:

654
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,094
All right. Goodbye.
You got nothing to say.

655
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:20,998
You're a loser. Fuck you.
Stay out of my life.

656
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,171
(clears throat)

657
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:34,078
Tim: Oh, yeah. That's great.

658
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,182
Look at this.

659
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:40,050
I wanted it to say, "Houston,
we have a rat problem,"

660
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:43,287
but we didn't... felt that was
a little confusing.

661
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:47,357
It's sort of from that,
<i> Ocean's...</i>

662
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,492
<i> Ocean's...</i> What is it?

663
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:51,729
<i> Apollo 13,</i>
"Houston, we have a problem."

664
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:54,531
This is, "Houston,
we have a rat problem,"

665
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,966
or just,
"We have a rat problem."

666
00:28:55,968 --> 00:29:00,204
Five thousand of these and then
a little more literature here.

667
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:02,773
"Vincent Rosetti tried"...

668
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:06,376
"Vincent Rosetti tried to put
an innocent man in prison.

669
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:08,112
Now he wants to get re-elected?"

670
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:10,748
And then it's Roset...
Me, as you can see,

671
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,418
as the exterminator,
Rosetti the Rat.

672
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,421
That's him.
We're about to bring change.

673
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,690
I've talked to you guys
about that.

674
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:21,892
(grunts) Let's do it.

675
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:24,928
And my keys are in my room.

676
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,830
Okay, we'll be back soon.

677
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,632
Shit.

678
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:32,636
All right, let's do the work
we need to do.

679
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:38,675
- Excuse me.
Can we put this in your window?
- woman: Yeah?

680
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:39,943
Yeah, go ahead.

681
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,079
Great. Should have brought tape.

682
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:43,213
Do you have any masking tape

683
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,948
or Scotch tape
or anything like that?

684
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,318
- man:
Right by the cash register.
- Oh, perfect.

685
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:52,656
That looks pretty good, huh?

686
00:29:58,063 --> 00:29:59,196
Hi, there.

687
00:29:59,198 --> 00:30:00,631
I'm running
for District Attorney.

688
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:03,066
My name is Tim Heidecker.
My name is Tim Heidecker.

689
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,535
I'm running
for District Attorney.

690
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:06,103
I'm running
for District Attorney

691
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:07,371
of San Bernardino County.

692
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,540
Would it be okay
to put these up in your window,

693
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:10,941
- just one of them? Thank you.
- Sure.

694
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:12,576
Just wanted to see
if you would be okay with me

695
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,978
putting some of my literature
in your window?

696
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,447
- Okay.
-<i> The message is resonating.</i>

697
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:22,553
<i> I love the sort of viral,</i>
<i> unorthodox message of,</i>

698
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:25,189
<i> "We have a rat problem,"</i>
<i> because it gets people talking.</i>

699
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:29,026
And I think it's...
it's a powerful message.

700
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:31,061
Once you get down to what
the message is,

701
00:30:31,063 --> 00:30:33,997
<i> you feel the trickle</i>
<i> of the message</i>

702
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,999
<i>spreading across this county,</i>

703
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,935
<i> and that's what's gonna</i>
<i> get us the big win.</i>

704
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:39,469
- woman: No sign now.
- Tim: I understand.

705
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:42,172
- I apologize.
- woman: Right. Thank you.

706
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:47,010
Tim: (sighs) Well,
that's a new one.

707
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:50,447
If there was a real rat problem
in that restaurant,

708
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:51,682
then it would be appropriate.

709
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,050
And if there isn't
a rat problem,

710
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:55,252
then they don't have
anything to worry about.

711
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,488
There we go.

712
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,357
Oh, great.

713
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,859
Shit.

714
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:07,497
Tim:<i> So, what are we doing</i>
<i> with the...</i>

715
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,933
<i> I mean, are we...</i>
<i> Do we have anybody coming down?</i>

716
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:12,736
- I'm working on it. Actually...
- Tim: Okay.

717
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:13,904
You said you were working on it.

718
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:16,240
I'm working on it.
CNN... We've got CNN.

719
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:17,941
- Tim: You have CNN?
- I have them on the line.

720
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,143
- Tim: You have them
on the line?
- It looks good. It looks good.

721
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:23,046
Good. What's happening
with the GoPro account?

722
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,948
What's GoPro?
Oh, you mean GoFundMe.

723
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,216
- Tim: Mm-hmm.
- It's GoFundMe.

724
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,517
I got it set up.

725
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,254
We have a few dollars.
People donated already.

726
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,222
Tim: Was it linked
to the website?

727
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,290
No, it's not linked.

728
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:34,691
I don't think we're able
to do that.

729
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,060
The donations are based...
Most of the time, GoFundMe

730
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:40,430
is set up for people who are,
like, sick or poor or starving.

731
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:41,865
- (telephone ringing)
- Hold on a sec.

732
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:43,333
Toni:
I really shouldn't technically

733
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,869
- be doing this, but...
- All right, hold on. Hello?

734
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,938
Yes. Hi.

735
00:31:48,274 --> 00:31:49,373
Oh, good. Great. Thanks.

736
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,942
- Okay. I'll be right down.
- Toni: Wait, wait, wait.

737
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:54,044
- Who was that?
- It's the front desk.

738
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:55,812
The hats arrived, so...

739
00:31:55,814 --> 00:31:57,848
- The hats? Oh, careful.
- (clattering)

740
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,716
Toni:<i> I think</i>
<i> it's going pretty well.</i>

741
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:00,851
<i> I've got GoFundMe.</i>

742
00:32:00,853 --> 00:32:04,621
I'm also... I just set up
a profile for him on IMDb.

743
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:07,791
Do you know what IMDb is?
It's an actors' website.

744
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:11,395
Have a gorgeous picture,
a couple of videos of him.

745
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:15,899
It looks like ABC is interested
in picking up our story.

746
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,669
So I'm gonna
keep on top of that.

747
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:19,836
I had a connection there,

748
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:22,039
so I did speak
with that connection,

749
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,640
and he referred me
to somebody else.

750
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:26,810
We're going door to door.
I mean, we're doing everything

751
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:29,479
- physically possible.
- (knocking)

752
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:30,414
Oh.

753
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,848
- Is that Tim? Yeah.
- Tim: Toni?

754
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,918
- Hey. I don't have my key.
- Toni: Okay. I'm coming.

755
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,553
Give me a sec.

756
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,822
That was fast. Wow.

757
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,258
- Hi. Yeah. This is it.
- Hi.

758
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,726
How are there 500 hats in here?

759
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:44,861
Toni: It looks like there
might be five hats in there.

760
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:47,531
- Toni: Who ordered the hats?
- Tim: You ordered the hats.

761
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:50,600
I don't remember
ordering five hats.

762
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:55,372
(clears throat) Yep.
There's one, two, three hats.

763
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:56,440
There's not even...

764
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,041
- There's three hats.
- I'll have to call them.

765
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,977
Let me put it on my list.
Hold on.

766
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:02,412
'Cause I think we paid
for those, yeah?

767
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:04,247
I'll make a call.
I'll send an email,

768
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:06,383
and then I'll follow up
with a phone call.

769
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,685
Very nice. (clears throat)

770
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:10,287
Tim: Here.

771
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,025
Toni: Yeah,
it's really nice, Tim.

772
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:17,227
Mm-hmm. Put it on.

773
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:19,963
Oh.

774
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,699
(sighs)

775
00:33:24,703 --> 00:33:27,871
Yeah, it's nice.
Yeah, I like it.

776
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,240
- Really nice.
- Tim: Figure out this...

777
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:32,109
- Toni: Yeah, I'll take care
of it right now.
- There's no point

778
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:34,077
in five... three fucking hats.

779
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,546
Don't worry about it.
I'll fix it.

780
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,649
- (clattering)
- I just...

781
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:43,153
(clattering)

782
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,161
Point of three hats are,
one for me, you,

783
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:53,263
and the volunteer we don't have.

784
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:57,834
Toni: Tim, there's wine
in the other room.

785
00:33:57,836 --> 00:33:59,636
- Why don't you have a glass?
- Tim: I might have a glass.

786
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:02,205
Toni: It might calm you down
a little bit.

787
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,207
(door closes)

788
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:10,580
(watch chimes)

789
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:17,454
All right,
let's pound some pavement.

790
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:26,696
- Tim: Hello.
- man: How you doing?

791
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,331
Tim: Good. How are you guys?

792
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:32,369
¶ (rap music playing) ¶

793
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,438
So, you getting a haircut?

794
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,406
Cool.

795
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,910
Are you a registered voter here
in San Bernardino?

796
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:40,911
- Yeah.
- Cool.

797
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:43,914
I want to eliminate crime
from the entire region...

798
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:46,450
and basically have
a zero-tolerance policy

799
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:49,653
for anybody that breaks the law.
I mean, it's not that...

800
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:51,054
I don't want to disrupt
your, uh,

801
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:52,789
- concentration there.
- No, you're fine, you're fine.

802
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:57,794
I'd probably not be
so kind on people...

803
00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:58,829
no offense to you guys,

804
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:00,630
but listening
to that kind of music.

805
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:03,800
I'd put a clamp down
on that kind of stuff...

806
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:07,537
just 'cause it's so...
you know, encourages violence.

807
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,906
You know, sort of taking
San Bernardino

808
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,808
back to the good old days.

809
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,211
Okay. I hear that.
Curtain down on E Street?

810
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:15,445
That's right.

811
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,214
man:

812
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:18,748
Well... (laughs)

813
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,417
...I know what you mean by that.

814
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:23,453
But it's complicated.

815
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,622
Things are changing.

816
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:27,991
All right?

817
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:30,594
- (bell chimes)
- Tim: Hello.

818
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:32,429
Running for District Attorney.

819
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:33,630
Sorry. I do not mean to solicit.

820
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:38,268
I'm just... free speech,
First Amendment, ability to...

821
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,337
woman:

822
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,472
- I'm sorry?
- woman:

823
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,740
I do have permission. I have...

824
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:46,109
From the county,
I have permission.

825
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:48,411
I have permission
from the First Amendment.

826
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,680
Look it up.
It's the Constitution.

827
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:55,352
I have a First Amendment right
in the Constitution.

828
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:59,990
I'm not filming you.
Get over yourself.

829
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:06,163
woman:

830
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:11,301
You'll vote for me!

831
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:12,636
<i> Kind of the full screen.</i>

832
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,971
Toni:<i> It is... Oh.</i>
<i> So, I hit full screen and...</i>

833
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,540
- Tim:<i> Then play.</i>
- Toni:<i> ...then "play."</i>

834
00:36:16,542 --> 00:36:18,375
<i> Okay. Got it. Okay.</i>

835
00:36:20,546 --> 00:36:22,012
Okay.

836
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,082
Tim: No.

837
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,757
- Toni: What?
- (Tim sighs)

838
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,325
Press play.

839
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,793
- Press pl...
- There we go. I got it.

840
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,495
man:<i> For District Attorney</i>
<i> Vincent Rosetti,</i>

841
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:41,031

842
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,566
-<i> It's a calling.</i>
- (Tim scoffs)

843
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:45,735
man:<i> A career prosecutor</i>

844

848
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:56,079
- Tim: It's not 100 percent.
- man:<i> As for Carlos Sandoval's</i>

849
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:57,314
- Toni: Mm-mm.
-<i> ...well,</i>

850
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:58,615
<i> there isn't much to show.</i>

851

<i> He's spent most of his career</i>

852
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:04,221

00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,489
<i> Vincent Rosetti,</i>
<i> tough on crime,</i>

854
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:09,292
<i> with a record</i>
<i> that speaks for itself.</i>

855
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:11,194
<i> I am District Attorney</i>
<i> Vincent Rosetti...</i>

856
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:14,364
"I am District Attorney
Vincent Rosetti."

857
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,333
- That sucks.
- What the hell?

858
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,901
I don't know.
Is it a good thing or not?

859
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,569
- I don't know.
- I... I don't...

860
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:20,804
We don't want negative press,

861
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:23,873
but, you know, you want
an acknowledgement that there's,

862
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,342
that we're in
the arena together.

863
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:28,011
But any press is good press.
You know what I'm saying?

864
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:29,279
There's no press for us.

865
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:32,082
We should put out a statement
about that at least.

866
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,550
Yeah, I'm gonna...
As soon as I get...

867
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:36,786
Put out a press release from me,
basically...

868
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:40,590
- (exhales)
- Get this... get this down.

869
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,725
You want the computer off?

870
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:43,660
No, I'm saying put the...
write this down.

871
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:45,362
All right, well, do you
have some suggestions?

872
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:46,863
- What are you...
- I'm telling you

873
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,865
- I want to send
a press release out, so...
- Okay.

874
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,701
All right. Will do.

875
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,872
Tim: All right, ready?

876
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:58,842
Get a Word document open
or something.

877
00:37:58,844 --> 00:37:59,876
Do you not have Word?

878
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:02,245
Toni: I don't know where
it is on this.

879
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:04,014
Let me see. Hold on.

880
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,783
That's to open the files.

881
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:09,319
(computer dings)

882
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:11,554
You should have sent this to me
on my computer.

883
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:15,692
- Write it on your notepad or...
- Oh, here, we got it.

884
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:18,628
Okay. Documents. Geez!

885
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,297
- Here.
- I'm losing my train

886
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:22,632
of thought here.
Just make a note.

887
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:26,803
"To whom it may concern...

888
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,907
I have recently viewed
the Vincent Rosetti attack ad."

889
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,009
- "Rebuttal."
- No. I...

890
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:35,645
I got it. "Vincent Rosetti."

891
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:41,451
"I have recently viewed
the Vincent Rosetti attack ad...

892
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:45,622
which was more full of lies
than...

893
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:47,991
whatever, a...

894
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,293
Yeah, but it wasn't an attack
against you.

895
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,362
- You weren't even in there.
- No, I know,
but it was an offic...

896
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:54,097
It was an... It was an attack
against Sandoval.

897
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:58,001
How about this?
"The recent Rosetti..."

898
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,937
"The recent Rosetti..."

899
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:03,106
Write that down,
"The recent Rosetti."

900
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:04,140
What are you doing?

901
00:39:04,142 --> 00:39:06,376
You know what I think
we should do, honestly?

902
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:10,413
I think that we should leave
Sandoval out of it completely.

903
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:13,083
- That's what I'm trying to do.
- Yeah. And just go after...

904
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:16,953
- Listen, just write what I'm...
- Go ahead. I'm listening.

905
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:22,892
"The recent Rosetti ad
that I saw on YouTube is so...

906
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:26,463
is dishonest, even for him."

907
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:28,965
(burps)

908
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:32,402
"Now that the race
is tightening"...

909
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:36,072
"Now that the race
is tightening...

910
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:41,878
we see the rat beginning
to scow... beginning to cower."

911
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:43,580
Mm-hmm.

912
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:46,416
Anything else?

913
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:48,351
No. I mean, all the...

914
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:49,819
"Visit the website"
and all that crap.

915
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,721
- But we need to get our own ad.
- Yeah. We will.

916
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,557
And we need to get a film crew
down here.

917
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,092
I mean, these guys could do it,
but they say

918
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,528
they're not gonna do it.
I've asked them 20 times.

919
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,763
Why can't they do it?

920
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:02,766
- They've got cameras.
- They say it's impartial
journalism or some shit.

921
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:03,967
I mean, he's scared, right?

922
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:06,870
That's what I...
That's what it's about.

923
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:07,837
He's scared.

924
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,742
He doesn't want to mention me
in the ad because he's so...

925
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,043
Toni: Oh!

926
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:21,184
So nervous about the mere
mention of my name than...

927
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,253
He's so...

928
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:25,455
Here, let me get
a napkin for you.

929
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:28,458
- Where are the napkins here?
- Tim: "He's so scared."

930
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,326
- Viral campaign that's...
- Toni: Here you go.

931
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,661
- There you go.
- Tim: Thank you.

932
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,730
- You're welcome.
- Tim: That's gotten...

933
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:36,032
Oh, it's on the floor.

934
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:37,434
Toni: I'm listening to you.
Go ahead.

935
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:40,003
Tim: I'm saying, so, there is...

936
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:41,438
If he brings my name, people go,

937
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,540
"Oh, that's the guy
with the 'rat problem' sign."

938
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:44,574
We can ignore the ad.

939
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,075
We don't have to directly talk

940
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,444
- about the ad.
- The ad is crap.

941
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:49,612
The ad is terrible anyway,
so it doesn't matter.

942
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,880
Let's just not focus on that.

943
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:52,749
- Let's just focus on us.
- I'm not worried about it.

944
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,684
- I'm not worried
about it, actually.
- Toni: Are you sure?

945
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,152
Because it seems
to bother you a lot.

946
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,053
Absolutely not.

947
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:58,621
Should we report that,
though, because...

948
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:01,224
- report that to YouTube.
- Toni: I don't think you can.

949
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:02,525
I think he paid for it legally.

950
00:41:02,527 --> 00:41:04,627
- I understand,
but there's factual in...
- Toni: You can't report it.

951
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,829
inaccuracies in there.

952
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:07,464
It is what it is.
It's out there.

953
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:09,532
- We, you know...
- Toni: Yeah.

954
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:10,767
Our preference would be that...

955
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,869
I think our preference is
that we're mentioned in there

956
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:15,238
because that at least provides
a little contrast.

957
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,040
Toni: That we are?
We're not mentioned.

958
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,441
- It's good.
- I know, but I'm saying

959
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:20,910
we should... it would be better,
but it's not there.

960
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:22,011
That's the reality.

961
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:26,516
Um, you know, we have to just
look at tomorrow as a new day

962
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:30,987
and do... you know,
get our to-do list going again

963
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:33,623
and... (burps)

964
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,526
...you know...

965
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:39,796
- Okay.
- Okay.

966
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,365
(Toni sighs)

967
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:46,503
- (computer dings)
- (Toni clears throat)

968
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:50,874
- (computer dings)
- (Toni sighs)

969
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:55,211
- (keyboard clacking)
- (computer dings)

970
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:58,848
Toni: That's it. Okay.

971
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,817
- (keyboard clacking)
- (computer dings)

972
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:04,821
- Toni: Yeah. Yeah.

973
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:27,677
(engaged dial tone)

974

with the petition
for the ballot.

988
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:09,552
And it's not... I know
it's not what you want to see.

989
00:43:09,554 --> 00:43:11,154
- Um...
- Toni: Oh, my God, Tim.

990
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:13,990
Yeah, I mean, well, we have...
add 30 from the website,

991
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:18,695
from the petition we put up
on the Internet, but, um...

992
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:21,364
Tim, this is not gonna cut it.

993
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:23,333
This is not gonna get us
on the ballot.

994
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:25,001
- You realize that.
- Tim: I understand. I know.

995
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:26,869
We're hundreds away,
hundreds of signatures away.

996
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:29,505
- Hundreds and hundreds away.
- Tim: I know.

997
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:31,507
Toni: I think we need to sit
and strategize

998
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:32,542
about this right now.

999
00:43:32,544 --> 00:43:34,310
- Okay.
- Do you think it'd be possible

1000
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:36,479
that we could have
a little privacy, um,

1001
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:40,116
just a little alone time
so that Tim and I can just...

1002
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,452
Tim: Josh, I think probably
a good idea

1003
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:44,854
to maybe
take a five-minute break.

1004
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:46,489
Toni: If you don't mind,
just so we can have

1005
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:48,658
- a few moments
to kind of reset.
- Yeah. We're getting into some

1006
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,792
sensitive territory here.

1007
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,628
- Josh: Sure. Yeah, you guys...
- Toni: Yeah.

1008
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,763
Tim: She's been... Yeah,
she's a little uncomfortable

1009
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:55,365
about being on camera.

1010
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:56,699
- Toni: Yeah.
- Tim: You know?

1011
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:59,002
- Tim: Thanks. Thanks, guys.
- Toni: We really appreciate it.

1012
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:00,637
Tim: And we have a...
You know, if you want

1013
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,472
to get something down
at the snack bar or anything,

1014
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:05,908
you can just put it
on the room, all right?

1015
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:09,445
- (door closes)
- They're gonna check
the address.

1016
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:10,847
They're not gonna check
the address.

1017
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:13,049
That was my point, that this is
all just a formality.

1018
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:14,784
- So let's just get into it.
- All right.

1019
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:18,421
John, uh... It doesn't matter.
John...

1020
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:20,390
- Trevor.
- ...Grover.

1021
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:21,357
Trevor Smith.

1022
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,626
- Peter...
- That's really close,

1023
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:25,294
so you're gonna need
to mix it up a little bit.

1024
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:27,897
Yeah, I'll change...
Why don't we change pens...

1025
00:44:27,899 --> 00:44:29,666
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- ...kind of randomly?

1026
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:32,402
Toni: So, look.
You see how I varied everything?

1027
00:44:32,404 --> 00:44:33,336
Tim: Mm-hmm.

1028
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,838
- So you got a Trevor Smith.
- Tim: Put this...

1029
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,274
Yeah, but why don't I do...
I'll do some on here.

1030
00:44:38,276 --> 00:44:41,210
- Toni: All right.
- Tim: And, um...

1031
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:44,514
Amy... Masters.

1032
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:46,282
- (Toni laughs) There you go.
- (Tim laughs)

1033
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:47,717
Tim: You do one,
and then I'll do one.

1034
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:52,255
- Perfect.
- Jason... Davidson.

1035
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:53,556
How about Johnny Mathis?

1036
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:56,392
- (Toni laughs)
- Johnny Mathis. Tom Cruise.

1037
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:58,428
- I'll make it Tom Cruise Jr.
- Oh, I'd like

1038
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,530
to make it Tom Cruise.

1039
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:01,798
What's the camera guy's name?

1040
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,033
- Vincent Price, huh?
- (laughs) No, don't do that.

1041
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,601
No? Why not? Who cares?

1042
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:06,703
I mean, it's all guys.

1043
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:08,304
- That's my problem.
- Do you have any siblings?

1044
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:10,907
Uh, no. I did,
but she's passed away.

1045
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:13,009
- She passed away
a couple years ago.
- I'll put my

1046
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,077
sister's name down.

1047
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,847
Joe Estevez. He would have
signed it. He's a friend.

1048
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:20,383
All right, good.
And now that's one, two...

1049
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:21,284
that's 20.

1050
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:23,252
Oh, my God, this is gonna
take us all night.

1051
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:24,554
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

1052
00:45:24,556 --> 00:45:26,656
- (Tim burps)
- You better grab another beer.

1053
00:45:26,658 --> 00:45:28,224
Another bottle of wine
for me, too.

1054
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,759
Where's the wine?

1055
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:35,064
Here you go, baby.
It's all good.

1056
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:35,965
Awesome.

I don't know how
I'm gonna not physically

1065
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:58,387
uh, assault this motherfucker
when I see him.

1066
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,555
I have to hold back.

1067
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:01,257
I mean, I'm getting
my adrenaline up,

1068
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,026
but, you know, I'm...
Listen, I'm gonna go to him

1069
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:05,661
straight up to his face and say,

1070
00:46:05,663 --> 00:46:08,030
"Motherfucker, you are
meeting me in the arena."

1071
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:09,699
I don't know. I don't know how
to predict it.

1072
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:10,933
I think he might take the bait.

1073
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,703
I think he might step right into
my trap and actually show up...

1074
00:46:13,705 --> 00:46:17,306
We hope he does, 'cause I think
we should hear from him.

1075
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:18,574
He has to answer for his crimes.

This is DKR doing the remix

I can't see anything.

Come on.
I'm gonna fucking punch him.

00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:19,902
Just gonna wait for that rat
to come out for his lunch,

1093
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:21,170
for his cheese.

We are out in front of
the District Attorney's office,

1097
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:30,279
waiting for Rosetti the Rat
to emerge.

1098
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:33,449
I'm gonna confront him
mano-a-mano

1099
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:34,684
and invite him into the arena

1100
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:37,086
so we can get this debate
going tomorrow night.

1101
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:39,555
And he should be out here
for his lunch break.

1102
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:42,725
It's been... He should have been
out here ten minutes ago.

All right, we are...
It's been 20 minutes, and uh...

There he is. All right,
here we go. We're going live.

Hey, Vincent! Rosetti!

1106
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:56,472
How you doing?
It's Tim Heidecker.

1107
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:58,007
How come you
haven't called back?

1108
00:47:58,009 --> 00:47:59,075
We've left you messages.

1109
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:01,444
We're challenging you
to a debate tomorrow night

1110
00:48:01,446 --> 00:48:04,714
at the Lincoln Suites downtown.

1111
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:05,915
You should join us.

1112
00:48:05,917 --> 00:48:07,283
I'd love to talk to you
about the issues.

1113
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:08,751
You have anything to say?

1114
00:48:08,753 --> 00:48:10,353
You can't be serious, Heidecker.

1115
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:11,320
No, I am serious.

1116
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:12,822
Why don't you want
to debate me, rat?

1117
00:48:12,824 --> 00:48:14,590
- You're a clown, Heidecker.
<i> -</i> You're a clown.

1118
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:16,125
Oh, I'd rather be a clown
than a rat.

1119
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,927
- I don't have time for this.
- Tim: You don't have time.

1120
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:19,962
- This conversation is over.
- Tim: Okay.

1121
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:21,464
- Thank you.
- Get out of my way, please.

1122
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:23,833
How come you couldn't beat me
in court?

1123
00:48:23,835 --> 00:48:25,001
What kind of DA is that?

1124
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:29,605
- First time in a courtroom me,
first time... Oh!
- (car horn honking)

1125
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:31,607
Folks, Vincent Rosetti,

1126
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:33,409
District Attorney
of San Bernardino,

1127
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,510
is trying to kill me.

1128
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:36,112
It's attempted murder
happening right here

1129
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:40,049
in front of the DA's office,
with his Honda piece of shit...

1130
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:43,052
Hey! Are you... Fuck you!

1131
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:45,354
Yeah. Oh, I got that on tape,
scumbag.

1132
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:50,092
I got your license plate.
7-B-N-V-6-0-0.

1133
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:53,896
<i> That is... Vincent Rosetti</i>
<i> just tried to kill me</i>
<i> on camera.</i>

1134
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:57,466
<i> We have it on camera.</i>
<i> He refuses to debate me.</i>

1135
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:59,835
Woo! That was awesome.
You guys get that?

1136
00:48:59,837 --> 00:49:03,539
I think Tim's running for DA
because he's just angry

1137
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:06,742
because Rosetti
did a really good job.

1138
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:08,844
<i> The case didn't go the way</i>
<i> Rosetti wanted,</i>

1139
00:49:08,846 --> 00:49:10,579
<i> but to the people</i>
<i> that watched it,</i>

1140
00:49:10,581 --> 00:49:14,350
<i> Tim was very, very guilty</i>
<i> and looked like a real fool.</i>

1141
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:17,253
He just always wants
to get revenge against anybody.

1142
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:19,255
Like, for instance,
I got free tickets

1143
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:22,091
to the<i> Sully</i> premiere...
not even the premiere,

1144
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:24,827
but the pre-premiere,
like the critics screenings.

1145
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:27,563
He was jealous 'cause he was
probably passed out

1146
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:29,165
somewhere in his vape den.

1147
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:31,500
And then I'm telling everyone,
"Oh,<i> Sully</i> is great.

1148
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:34,503
This is the film of the year.
This is gonna win Oscars."

1149
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,505
And he's like, "What's<i> Sully?"</i>

1150
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:38,574
I think if you point it back
at him

1151
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:39,709
with a lot of these things,

1152
00:49:39,711 --> 00:49:41,277
turn it around
and point it at him,

1153
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:42,611
and you'll find out the truth.

1154
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:45,581
I saw it in the first group
of 300 people

1155
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:46,682
ever to see<i> Sully.</i>

1156
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:48,684
Tim:<i> We're in a town hall</i>
<i> debate tomorrow</i>

1157
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:50,286
<i> for District Attorney,</i>
<i> if you're interested.</i>

1158
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:52,188
- woman: Sure.
- Thanks. I forgot to put the...

1159
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:55,057
(chuckles) ...forgot to put
the time and date on it.

1160
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:57,026
- So, it's tomorrow.
- woman: Tomorrow.

1161
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:57,793
Yep.

1162
00:49:57,795 --> 00:50:01,998
<i> Toni forgot to put the date</i>
<i> and time</i>

1163
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,967
<i> on the town hall debate</i>
<i> happening tomorrow.</i>

1164
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:06,535
<i> But it's no problem.</i>
<i> I'm just...</i>

1165
00:50:06,537 --> 00:50:09,238
<i> I'm just kind of putting</i>
<i> a little personal touch on it.</i>

1166
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,473
<i> Me, Rosetti, and Sandoval</i>

1167
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:13,309
<i> are gonna be talking</i>
<i> about the issues tomorrow.</i>

1168
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:14,977
And I'm looking forward to it.

1169
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:17,046
<i> I don't think</i>
<i> in a million years</i>
<i> I would have thought</i>

1170
00:50:17,048 --> 00:50:20,349
<i> I would be standing in front</i>
<i> of San Bernardino City Hall</i>

1171
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:24,320
<i> knowing that I was only</i>
<i> a few steps away from becoming</i>

1172
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:27,890
<i> not only District Attorney,</i>
<i> but hopefully even higher</i>

1173
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:31,093
<i> in the chain of command</i>
<i> within San Bernardino.</i>

1174
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:34,363
<i> So, you know,</i>
<i> it's starting to feel real.</i>

1175
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,732
<i> I'm not nervous.</i>
<i> I just feel a sense</i>

1176
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:38,768
<i>of obligation to the community</i>

1177
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:41,704
<i> that I'm doing this</i>
<i> for the right reasons.</i>

1178
00:50:41,873 --> 00:50:45,307
There's
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr...

1179
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:50,579
poster... a statue of him,
one of the founding fathers.

1180
00:50:50,581 --> 00:50:53,349
Uh, you know, just one
of the people I look up to

1181
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:58,087
and I'm always quoting
and using his message

1182
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:02,124
to get me through, you know,
what I'm going through.

1183
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:04,193
One of the great citizens
of San Bernardino and...

1184
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:06,762
was one of the greats.
Unfortunately, he passed.

1185
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:10,800
But we are always remembering
his words and deeds.

1186
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:13,702
So, I'm gonna go pay homage
to him privately.

1187
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:19,308
- (siren wailing)
- (firetruck horn honking)

1188
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:22,511
Tim:<i> I can feel the energy</i>
<i> coming off something like that,</i>

1189
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:24,313
<i> such, uh, a great icon</i>

1190
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:27,817
<i> of the San Bernardino Valley</i>
<i> and the county.</i>

1191
00:51:27,819 --> 00:51:29,819
<i> You know, as I come</i>
<i> to work each day,</i>

1192
00:51:29,821 --> 00:51:32,555
<i> obviously I'll be at</i>
<i> the District Attorney's office,</i>

1193
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:35,324
but I'm sure I'll be scrambling
to and fro,

1194
00:51:35,326 --> 00:51:38,928
visiting City Hall,
chiming in on new laws.

1195
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,496
I'm sure I will stop each time

1196
00:51:40,498 --> 00:51:42,531
and pay my respects
to this beautiful fountain,

1197
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:46,402
this rushing water,
reminiscent of the Rio Grande

1198
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:47,536
or the great Mississippi

1199
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:49,605
or any of the rivers
of our great country,

1200
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:52,007
and pausing to reflect
on the message

1201
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:53,342
of Dr. Martin Luther King.

1202
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:57,847
It's fitting that San Bernardino
has such a monument here,

1203
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:02,585
and I'm glad we got to spend
some time enjoying it together.

1204
00:52:02,587 --> 00:52:05,821
Josh, if you want to get
your picture taken with it.

1205
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,893
Gregg: Hey, guys.

1206
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:13,562
<i> Josh.</i>
<i> What are you guys shooting?</i>

1207
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:15,898
Josh: Uh, just some B-roll.

1208
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:19,401
A lot of cool movies
shot in San Bernardino.

1209
00:52:19,403 --> 00:52:20,336
You know<i> Congo?</i>

1210
00:52:20,338 --> 00:52:22,037
You'll never guess
where that was shot.

1211
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:24,507
They actually shot
the airport scenes right here

1212
00:52:24,509 --> 00:52:26,775
at the San Bernardino Airport...

1213
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:29,512
- Josh: I didn't know that.
- ...not in the Congo.

1214
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,546
Kind of cool.

1215
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:33,249
<i> Independence Day,</i> too,
they shot in Fontana.

1216
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:36,352
Josh: Sorry I didn't, uh...
I got your messages.

1217
00:52:36,354 --> 00:52:38,721
Yeah. Um,
I wanted to talk to you

1218
00:52:38,723 --> 00:52:41,056
about this<i> Shaggy DA</i> thing,
and then, also,

1219
00:52:41,058 --> 00:52:42,558
I had this idea...

1220
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,928
and if you guys are into it,
we go to a Baskin-Robbins

1221
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:48,631
and shoot me coming out
of the Baskin-Robbins...

1222
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:49,899
- Josh: Oh.
- ...sort of like

1223
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:51,400
as the character
from<i> Ant-Man...</i>

1224
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:52,835
- Josh: Mm-hmm.
- ...just coming out

1225
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:56,138
of the thing. And then I can
talk to you guys or whatever,

1226
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,039
be in character.

1227
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:58,707
Josh: Yeah. I don't know
if we can do that today.

1228
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:00,609
- Maybe, um...
- There's a Baskin-Robbins.

1229
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:03,913
I checked. It's about a mile
from here, on 5th.

1230
00:53:03,915 --> 00:53:06,182
Josh: We got a lot of stuff
we got to cover today.

1231
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:07,883
We're meeting back up with Tim
in a little bit.

1232
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:10,052
Well, you've got enough of him,
I'm sure.

1233
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:11,487
We've actually
got to get going now.

1234
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:13,656
We have a couple other spots
we have to hit up.

1235
00:53:13,658 --> 00:53:16,825
- But it was nice
running into you.
- Okay, well, I'll come along.

1236
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:18,394
Josh: That's okay.

1237
00:53:37,582 --> 00:53:40,416
- Manuel:<i> How are you, man?</i>
- Tim:<i> Hey, man.</i>

1238
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:42,384
I'm fucking tired.

1239
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:44,353
- What time is it there, man?
- Manuel:<i> How are you, man?</i>

1240
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:45,554
<i> So good to hear from you.</i>

1241
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:48,424
Yeah. Good to hear from you,
man. It's...

1242
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:50,259
- What?
- Manuel:<i> It's 4:20</i>

1243
00:53:50,261 --> 00:53:52,494
<i> in the morning.</i>
<i> 4:20 in the morning.</i>

1244
00:53:52,496 --> 00:53:54,697
You're probably up partying.

1245
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:57,866
<i> You know, Manuel has...</i>

1246
00:53:57,868 --> 00:54:00,536
<i> Because of what happened</i>
<i> with him at the trial,</i>

1247
00:54:00,538 --> 00:54:02,871
<i>he's essentially back in Italy.</i>

1248
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:07,977
"I, Dr. San, am only one
responsible for all the death

1249
00:54:07,979 --> 00:54:10,379
from the Electric Sun 20.

1250
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:11,747
It is all my fault."

1251
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,983
You took an oath,
and you swore before God

1252
00:54:13,985 --> 00:54:16,352
- that you would tell the truth.
- Come on.

1253
00:54:16,354 --> 00:54:18,787
I'm gonna ask you now
one more time.

1254
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:20,422
Who wrote the letter?

1255
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,691
- Tim gave it to me
this morning.
- Vincent: Okay.

1256
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:24,126
He talks like
they're his friends

1257
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:26,095
and says they're his rock
and all this stuff,

1258
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:29,331
but those guys, believe me,
the minute he doesn't pay them,

1259
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:30,633
<i> you don't see them around.</i>

1260
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:32,234
<i> They're gone for long periods</i>
<i> of time.</i>

1261
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:34,870
<i> And then he gets a little bit</i>
<i> of money through some scam,</i>

1262
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:36,839
<i> and then suddenly,</i>
<i> there's Axiom, Manuel,</i>

1263
00:54:36,841 --> 00:54:39,174
and they're doing
recordings again.

1264
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:42,611
You are so worried
about this perjury shit

1265
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:43,846
from the trial, that...

1266
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:46,615
it is not something
that they're gonna follow up on

1267
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:47,783
because when you get back here,

1268
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:50,152
I'm gonna be in charge
of that shit.

1269
00:54:50,154 --> 00:54:52,087
You know what I mean?

1270
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:53,656
Manuel:

1271
00:54:53,658 --> 00:54:58,093
And Axiom's not calling me back,
and he's being, you know...

1272
00:54:58,095 --> 00:55:03,399
like suddenly creating a wall
that I don't understand.

1273
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:04,667
Hold on, Manuel.

1274
00:55:04,669 --> 00:55:06,168
- Toni!
- Toni: Yeah?

1275
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,537
Can you get another one
of these, please?

1276
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,639
- Toni: Uh, sure.
- Thanks.

1277
00:55:12,543 --> 00:55:14,410
I'm sorry.
I'm doing this campaign,

1278
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:19,381
and we're, like, trying to get
this town hall thing going.

1279
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:20,883
It's like... It's not as easy

1280
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:22,985
as just going down
and playing a show.

1281
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:25,454
- And I'm doing this...
- Manuel:

1282
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:28,957
I'm doing this
with this woman who's...

1283
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:31,427
- What is it?
- We need to talk.

1284
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:32,928
- Okay.
- So?

1285
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,063
- Right now?
- Yeah.

1286
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:35,464
- Okay. Hold on.
- Come on out.

1287
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:37,533
- Get off the phone
and come out and talk.
- I can't get out. Hold on.

1288
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:39,201
Manuel, baby, I got
to call you back, man.

1289
00:55:39,203 --> 00:55:43,339
Keep rocking, and I love you,
and we'll talk soon.

1290
00:55:44,075 --> 00:55:46,508
- Manuel:
- Cheers.

1291
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:48,377
Ciao.

1292
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,380
- What's up?
- Well...

1293
00:55:51,482 --> 00:55:54,183
- I sort of have some bad news.
- Okay.

1294
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:56,552
I had all of these guys
in the loop,

1295
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:59,555
and they've all pretty much
just dropped out.

1296
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:00,622
Tim: Mm-hmm.

1297
00:56:00,624 --> 00:56:02,658
I mean, everything
was in a pending mode.

1298
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,660
I can't even get<i> The Sun</i>
to come.

1299
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:06,161
- What do you mean?
- I can't even get

1300
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:07,863
- the<i> San Bernardino Sun.</i>
- They're not com...

1301
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,398
- They're not...
- They're not coming, Tim.

1302
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,567
- They said they're not coming?
- They said they're not coming.

1303
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:13,168
Why wouldn't they come?
It's a...

1304
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:16,271
- it's an official campaign.
- I know. I unders...

1305
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:17,439
You're telling me they're not...

1306
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:18,941
they've confirmed to you
that they're not coming?

1307
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,276
They've confirmed
that they're not coming.

1308
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:22,444
- Ugh!
- They actually sent me

1309
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:24,947
an email
and it wasn't a very nice one.

1310
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:25,647
Hmm.

1311
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:26,782
We're gonna do the best we can.

1312
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:28,884
And what about Rosetti
and Sandoval?

1313
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,519
I haven't heard
from either of them.

1314
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:32,020
- They won't confirm.
- All right, well,

1315
00:56:32,022 --> 00:56:34,823
I mean, so,
what are we doing tomorrow?

1316
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,965
Tim:<i> Toni put the big ad</i>
<i> for the town hall</i>

1317
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:45,367
in the, uh, paper this morning.

1318
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:47,569
(coins clinking)

1319
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:49,538
Last one.

1320
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:53,008
(horn honks)

1321
00:56:57,448 --> 00:57:01,016
It's not supposed
to be in Sports. Let me just...

1322
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,421
Call Toni Newman.

1323
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,359
Hey, Siri. Toni,
I'll bring it back to the room,

1324
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:12,828
but I'm telling you,
there's no ad

1325
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,062
for the town hall debate.

1326
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:18,434
The "We have a rat problem" ad
isn't in there, either, so...

1327
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:22,104
Well, that's a lot of money.

1328
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:24,606
It doesn't do us any good
to put it in tomorrow.

1329
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:28,177
You know what I mean?
I'm not saying it's your fault.

1330
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:30,379
I'm saying that
it's not in the paper.

1331
00:57:30,381 --> 00:57:31,246
That's the news.

1332
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:33,315
So, I'll be back
in a few minutes.

1333
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,784
All right, yeah. Take care.

1334
00:57:36,187 --> 00:57:38,287
All right. Love you, too.

1335
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:42,357
<i> She said she put that ad</i>
<i> in like a week ago</i>

1336
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:43,625
<i> and that they needed more...</i>

1337
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,994
<i> that she thinks they might have</i>
<i> needed more time,</i>

1338
00:57:45,996 --> 00:57:47,162
<i>but that sounds like bullshit.</i>

1339
00:57:47,164 --> 00:57:48,864
I'm not worried about it
because print media's dead

1340
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:50,532
and there's not a lot of people
picking that up.

1341
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:54,403
You saw the disarray
that the news stand was in.

1342
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:56,104
Anyways, I don't... That's...

1343
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:58,941
We don't need to use that stuff
'cause I...

1344
00:57:58,943 --> 00:58:00,309
I don't want to get her
in trouble.

1345
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:01,910
I don't want to...
It's nobody's fault.

1346
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:05,247
It's just...
There's a lot to do.

1347
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,750
(clears throat)
There's a lot to do.

1348
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:18,627
How's that look?

1349
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:22,164
Doing a little debate prep,
a little issue research.

1350
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:26,268
<i> You know, that's pretty much</i>
<i> my day, has been prepping</i>

1351
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:30,205
<i>so I'm as educated as I can be</i>
<i>on the issues of San Bernardino</i>

1352
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:32,007
<i> and also getting to a place</i>

1353
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,009
where we have a real
competitive chance to win.

1354
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,578
- Tim, where do you want to sit?
- Right in the middle.

1355
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,580
Right in the center? Okay.
I'll put you...

1356
00:58:38,582 --> 00:58:39,615
I'm gonna put you here.

1357
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:41,183
Why don't we put a couple
on the table?

1358
00:58:41,185 --> 00:58:42,851
- What do you think?
- Tim: Oh, on his seat.

1359
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:44,953
- Yeah. Or in front of him.
- (laughs) Yeah.

1360
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:46,188
Let's do it.

1361
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,090
We have a rat problem.

1362
00:58:48,092 --> 00:58:49,324
- Tim: Yeah.
- (Toni laughs)

1363
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:51,360
I'm getting to the place
where I'm kind of off-book

1364
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:53,862
with this memorizing
all this stuff.

1365
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,631
And I got a hundred more
of these books

1366
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:58,667
waiting for me to put up here.

1367
00:58:58,669 --> 00:58:59,735
It's going very well.

1368
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:01,436
The energy he had
in that parking lot

1369
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:02,905
and the confrontation
was he wanted

1370
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:04,206
to have nothing
to do with us.

1371
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,108
Well, if he doesn't show,
that makes him look bad.

1372
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:09,678
I think the plan should be,
at 7:15, if there's no...

1373
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,081
if Rosetti doesn't show
and if Carlos doesn't show,

1374
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:14,483
it becomes the town hall.

1375
00:59:14,485 --> 00:59:16,451
- Becomes about you.
- It becomes about me.

1376
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:18,053
That's it.
That's what we want anyway.

1377
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:19,922
- All right, cool. All right.
- Awesome.

1378
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:21,523
I'm gonna clean up,
and I'm gonna head up

1379
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:22,858
- to the room.
- Toni: All right.

1380
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,192
- Tim: You want to come?
- You know what?

1381
00:59:24,194 --> 00:59:25,694
Let me just tidy up
a little bit.

1382
00:59:25,696 --> 00:59:28,130
- I'll meet you up there
in a second, okay?
- Tim: Okay. All right.

1383
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:49,618
(whispers) Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

1384
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:54,590
<i> It's been an honor to be here</i>
<i> with you guys tonight.</i>

1385
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:56,458
<i> I want to talk to you</i>
<i> about why I'm running</i>

1386
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,528
<i> for District Attorney</i>
<i> of San Bernardino.</i>

1387
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:00,996
I'm gonna talk to you
about why...

1388
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:03,131
I want to talk to you about why
I'm running for San Bern...

1389
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:05,667
District Attorney
of San Bernardino.

1390
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:07,135
<i> You know, I'm an outsider.</i>

1391
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:08,870
(clearing throat)
<i> My name is Tim Heidecker.</i>

1392
01:00:08,872 --> 01:00:12,908
<i> I'm running for District</i>
<i> Attorney of San Bernardino.</i>

1393
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,610
<i> It's good to meet you guys.</i>

1394
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:17,179
<i>Sold-out crowd. Unbelievable.</i>

1395
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:20,482
<i> We know firsthand...</i>
<i> we know firsthand</i>

1396
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:24,119
<i> that our community is suffering</i>
<i> from high rates of crime,</i>

1397
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:31,760
<i> and my idea,</i>
<i> my campaign pledge is to...</i>

1398
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:38,600
is to remove crime,
eliminate crime.

1399
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:43,005
Well, I'm looking
at the world now,

1400
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:44,172
and it's going insane.

1401
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:46,975
Toni: Well, I'll do
a brief introduction

1402
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:50,112
so that it looks really nice
before you come in.

1403
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:51,380
What you got? I got some strays.

1404
01:00:51,382 --> 01:00:53,415
- I've been working
on that all morning.
- (laughs) I know,

1405
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:56,151
- let me fix it.
- Are we just saying goodbye
to the debate idea?

1406
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,787
- 'Cause they're... I mean...
- Toni: Well, let's give them

1407
01:00:58,789 --> 01:00:59,788
a little bit more time.

1408
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,223
I mean, they might
still show up.

1409
01:01:01,225 --> 01:01:03,458
So, I mean, we're still just
a few minutes over, so...

1410
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,527
I mean, we...
Okay, well, it's almost...

1411
01:01:05,529 --> 01:01:07,729
- It's 7:12 now.
- Yeah. I...

1412
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:09,197
When are we pulling
the trigger on it?

1413
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:10,666
Yeah, I don't have any messages
from them.

1414
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:12,100
How about you?
Do you have any messages?

1415
01:01:12,102 --> 01:01:13,268
No, my iWatch has been quiet.

1416
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:16,838
<i> I think we hit Rosetti</i>
<i> right away...</i>

1417
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,674
<i> or not... or either</i>
<i> we're gonna save that</i>

1418
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:20,442
<i> - as the closing...</i>
- Toni:<i> Why don't we do this?</i>

1419
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:22,077
Why don't we go
with the positive first?

1420
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,047
Let's make you look good,
make you look amazing.

1421
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:27,082
- Let's sell your points.
- I have one for one.

1422
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:28,383
I don't want to say
"One for one."

1423
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:29,651
I want to say
"Perfect record."

1424
01:01:29,653 --> 01:01:30,652
Well, let's just...

1425
01:01:30,654 --> 01:01:32,054
- your accomplishments...
- Mm-hmm.

1426
01:01:32,056 --> 01:01:34,156
- ...your goals.
- Small business.

1427
01:01:34,558 --> 01:01:36,291
You look really nice, Tim.

1428
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:38,694
- Thank you.
- And you're gonna wow them.

1429
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:40,462
Just get your mouth wet.

1430
01:01:40,464 --> 01:01:41,630
What do you have? Is it Orbits?

1431
01:01:41,632 --> 01:01:43,598
(Toni laughs)
It's your favorite. Of course.

1432
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,900
- Great.
- Toni: How'd you know?

1433
01:01:44,902 --> 01:01:47,936
- Well, I know you carry Orbits.
- There you go.

1434
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:49,738
Good luck.
We'll see you in there, okay?

1435
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,339
- Okay. See you.
- Toni: See you in a minute.

1436
01:01:51,341 --> 01:01:53,709
- Yeah. We'll talk soon.
- Toni: Okay.

1437
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:26,007
Hey. This is the movie
I was telling you about,

1438
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:30,045
<i> The Shaggy DA</i>
with Dean Jones from 1976.

1439
01:02:30,047 --> 01:02:31,680
It's got total parallels

1440
01:02:31,682 --> 01:02:34,082
to what Tim's campaign
is doing right now.

1441
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,651
Like, if you watch it, it almost
feels like this campaign

1442
01:02:36,653 --> 01:02:37,986
is a remake of this movie.

1443
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:41,356
Um, and it's out of print
on VHS, so I went ahead

1444
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:44,292
and dubbed a copy and then
glued this thing over it

1445
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:46,428
because you won't really
get this anywhere.

1446
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,363
It's not on eBay or anywhere.

1447
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:50,365
So, take a look
and see what you think.

1448
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,868
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1449
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:55,070
Thank you all for coming.

1450
01:02:55,706 --> 01:02:58,073
Josh:

1451
01:02:58,075 --> 01:02:59,775
- What are you talking about?
- Josh: Gregg.

1452
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:02,310
Here's here
at the town hall.

1453
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:04,613
(crowd applauding)

1454
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:07,883
- He's in the room right here?
- Josh: Yeah.

1455
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:12,087
- Fuck.
<i> - ¶ Well I'm looking</i>
<i> At the world now ¶</i>

1456
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:14,289
<i> ¶ And it's going insane ¶</i>

1457
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:19,895
<i> ¶ Thinking 'bout checking out</i>
<i> Can't do it again ¶</i>

1458
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:21,496
Tim: All right. Hey, everybody!

1459
01:03:21,498 --> 01:03:26,434
<i> ¶ But I know just who I am</i>
<i> How strong I can be ¶</i>

1460
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:27,969

1464
01:03:36,046 --> 01:03:38,313
<i> ¶ This country's yours</i>
<i> And mine ¶</i>

1465
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:42,317
Thanks, guys, for coming out.
This is gonna be a good time.

1466
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,419
(clears throat) Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen,

1467
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:46,421
for being here. This is, uh...

1468
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:48,690
Well, we're gonna do things
a little differently.

1469
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:49,891
I see you, by the way.

1470
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:52,027
I see that you've decided
to show up,

1471
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:54,563
and it's not...
you're not gonna ruin my night.

1472
01:03:54,565 --> 01:03:55,397
Gregg:

1473
01:03:55,399 --> 01:03:58,667
Well, save your questions
for the Q&A portion.

1474
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:02,704
Um, I played this song here
that I wrote a few years ago.

1475
01:04:02,706 --> 01:04:04,105
How many people feel
that way lately,

1476
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:06,975
it feels like the values,
the thing...

1477
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:11,413
"The way things used to be
ain't that way no more"

1478
01:04:11,415 --> 01:04:12,514
is another expression.

1479
01:04:12,516 --> 01:04:15,984
And, uh, for some,
for people like you, it's...

1480
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:19,287
it's a good opportunity...
(clears throat)

1481
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:23,658
...but for the original
San Bernardino people...

1482
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:25,327
of the '50s and '60s,

1483
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:27,929
life has not... is getting
a little weird, isn't it?

1484
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:31,733
Anyways, what else did I want
to say about that?

1485
01:04:31,735 --> 01:04:33,568
Demographics.

1486
01:04:33,637 --> 01:04:38,139
Um, imagine if you had
a candidate who stripped...

1487
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:43,411
who promised on the day one that
we would be eliminating crime.

1488
01:04:43,413 --> 01:04:45,046
How many people would vote
for that candidate?

1489
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:48,183
And we're talking 100 percent
elimination of crime.

1490
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:51,119
That's what my candidacy
will deliver as DA.

1491
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:52,287
My name is Tim Heidecker.

1492
01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:55,657
I'm a businessman,
a legal expert, an entrepreneur.

1493
01:04:55,659 --> 01:05:01,029
I've got several years
of experience in this area.

1494
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:03,064
And I'm a proven leader.

1495
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:06,701
I ran a small business here
in the county,

1496
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:08,904
in Victorville, the...

1497
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:12,073
the Victorville Film Archive
Film Center.

1498
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:13,675
- You didn't run it.
- Tim: Excuse me?

1499
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:15,777
- You didn't run it.
- Tim: I did run it, actually.

1500
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:16,978
- No. I ran it.
- Actually,

1501
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,446
this is not a Q&A period
of the show, sir,

1502
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:21,082
so if you wouldn't mind
taking your hat off.

1503
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:22,117
That's strike two.

1504
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:24,719
And I won't be taking questions
from you, either.

1505
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:26,788
I apologize. He's an instigator.

1506
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:31,026
And how many people
have had trouble with Roset...

1507
01:05:31,028 --> 01:05:32,227
with Victor Ros... I'm sorry.

1508
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:34,763
That should be
"Vincent Rosetti."

1509
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:37,666
Toni.

1510
01:05:37,668 --> 01:05:40,135
But the question is,
where is Rosetti? Where is he?

1511
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:43,872
Where is... What...
He's hiding in some rat hole.

1512
01:05:43,874 --> 01:05:48,443
He does not want to come
and face me in the arena.

1513
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:53,315
Okay?

1514
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:54,482
We have a rat problem.

1515
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:57,719
- (cell phone dings)
- We got to ch...
set the rat trap!

1516
01:05:57,721 --> 01:06:01,623
And I'm the exterminator.
You know?

1517
01:06:01,625 --> 01:06:04,359
So, we're trying
to get that going.

1518
01:06:04,361 --> 01:06:06,294
We have a rat problem.

1519
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,629
And that would be great
if everybody

1520
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:09,264
was joining in on that.

1521
01:06:09,266 --> 01:06:12,000
We have a rat problem.

1522
01:06:12,703 --> 01:06:14,202
We have a rat problem.

1523
01:06:14,204 --> 01:06:16,338
- woman: We have a rat problem.
- We have a rat problem.

1524
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:19,007
And it's Rosetti the Rat.
He's corrupt.

1525
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:20,475
And I actually have
some experience,

1526
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,477
interestingly enough,
of dealing with corruption.

1527
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:25,080
I wrote and produced
and directed and starred in

1528
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:28,383
the great<i> Decker</i> TV show,
currently on hiatus.

1529
01:06:28,385 --> 01:06:32,954
And had an interesting character
that some of you guys

1530
01:06:32,956 --> 01:06:36,024
probably remember,
President Jason Davidson,

1531
01:06:36,026 --> 01:06:39,094
one of the most
corrupt politicians in history,

1532
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:41,429
if you could believe that.
Production always said

1533
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:43,565
how well<i> Decker</i> actually dealt

1534
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:47,535
with the whole
corruption concept.

1535
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:48,703
So I'm way ahead of that,

1536
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:54,175
and we're having a good time
figuring out. So, uh...

1537
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:55,643
you put your hat back on.

1538
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:59,047
Can you take your hat off
if you're gonna be inside?

1539
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:03,084
Thank you. Medicaid fraud...
we have that in the news lately.

1540
01:07:03,086 --> 01:07:06,187
I don't know if you've seen
this Medicaid fraud.

1541
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:09,691
We have people taking advantage
of the system.

1542
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:13,261
There's people out there
who are basically vegetables,

1543
01:07:13,263 --> 01:07:15,430
who are brain-dead
and who have not...

1544
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:16,564
can't feed themselves.

1545
01:07:16,566 --> 01:07:18,833
And then you have people who are
taking advantage of those people

1546
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:21,136
and taking a paycheck
from that experience.

1547
01:07:21,138 --> 01:07:24,472
And that's something
I'm gonna be fighting for,

1548
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:25,774
so watch...

1549
01:07:25,776 --> 01:07:27,776
- watch out for that.
- Gregg: You're the one
that put them

1550
01:07:27,778 --> 01:07:29,711
- in that position
in the first place...
- Tim: Excuse me?

1551
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:31,579
...by depriving oxygen
with a scuba tank

1552
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:33,348
- that didn't work.
- Tim: Now, we're not getting

1553
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:36,251
into the details of that case.
That's a very sensitive case.

1554
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:39,854
And, anyways, we are, uh,
gonna open it up to the floor,

1555
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:43,725
if anybody has any questions.
It is a town hall event.

1556
01:07:43,727 --> 01:07:46,261
- Gregg: I have a question.
Why did you...
- Tim: No. I'm sorry.

1557
01:07:46,263 --> 01:07:47,896
We're not taking questions
from you.

1558
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:48,930
If you're wearing a hat,

1559
01:07:48,932 --> 01:07:50,432
you will not be allowed
to ask a question.

1560
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:52,033
- Why did you say that...
- Tim: Ma'am... Shut up.

1561
01:07:52,035 --> 01:07:54,135
Now ask your question.
You may ask a question.

1562
01:07:54,137 --> 01:07:55,970
- Indidi: Hello. Good evening.
- Good evening to you.

1563
01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:57,572
- So, you mentioned...
- What's your name, by the way?

1564
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,174
- I didn't get...
- My name is Indidi.

1565
01:07:59,176 --> 01:08:00,975
- Indidi. Indeedy, we sh...
- Yes.

1566
01:08:00,977 --> 01:08:04,312
Uh, Indidi, indeedy,
it's nice to see you.

1567
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:06,181
- Nice to see you, too. Yes.
- Indidi.

1568
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:08,249
So, you mentioned
how it's your pledge

1569
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,685
to erase crime in the community.

1570
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:12,087
How would you make sure
that defendants

1571
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:14,422
still get a fair trial
while accomplishing your goal

1572
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:15,990
of eliminating crime
in our communities?

1573
01:08:15,992 --> 01:08:18,426
Terrific question. Thank you
for asking that question.

1574
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:22,897
It's really nice to get
that kind of brain here,

1575
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:25,066
that kind of thinking,
which you...

1576
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:27,969
you excel in, frankly.

1577
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:29,537
Um...

1578
01:08:30,107 --> 01:08:31,539
you know, a little personal,

1579
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:35,210
but I was wrongly accused
of a crime myself.

1580
01:08:35,212 --> 01:08:37,712
So, that's one of the reasons
I'm running, actually,

1581
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:40,148
Indidi, indeedy,
is why I'm running.

1582
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:42,450
Um, yes, indeedy,
that is why I'm running.

1583
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:44,619
Uh, represented myself
in court...

1584
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:48,256
and successfully, I might add,
where I was convict...

1585
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:49,290
I was not convicted.

1586
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:52,427
I was accused of something,
but I did...

1587
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:54,129
- Mass murder.
- Excuse me?

1588
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:56,764
Mass murder,
killing 19 people.

1589
01:08:56,766 --> 01:08:59,868
It doesn't matter
what I was accused of.

1590
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:01,836
What matters is the truth.

1591
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:05,273
The truth is, the court
of San Bernardino

1592
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:06,374
found me not guilty,

1593
01:09:06,376 --> 01:09:11,980
despite the worst best efforts
of Rosetti and his squad of rats

1594
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:14,048
and pigs.

1595
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:18,820
So, my point is,
to get to your question,

1596
01:09:19,089 --> 01:09:21,456
I will be fighting
for the innocent.

1597
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:24,292
Now, if you commit a crime
on my watch...

1598
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:27,662
you're going to jail
forever, right?

1599
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:30,231
No more three strikes,
you're out. You're done.

1600
01:09:30,233 --> 01:09:32,834
That's the community
we want to create.

1601
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:34,836
But if you're innocent,
let's let...

1602
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:36,037
let's let you be innocent.

1603
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:39,407
Let's not put the courts...
Let's not put you under the...

1604
01:09:39,409 --> 01:09:42,877
the heel of just...
of corrupt justice.

1605
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:44,546
- Tim: Anybody else?
- Why did you say that you...

1606
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:46,114
- I didn't call on you.
- I just want to know

1607
01:09:46,116 --> 01:09:48,850
why you said that you were
a small business owner

1608
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:51,586
and ran the VFA
when you didn't run the VFA.

1609
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:54,022
- You burned the VFA down.
- I did not burn...

1610
01:09:54,024 --> 01:09:55,256
See, that's false accusations.

1611
01:09:55,258 --> 01:09:57,025
This is what got me into trouble
in the first place.

1612
01:09:57,027 --> 01:09:59,127
- Two times you burned down
the film archive.
- No, that's not true.

1613
01:09:59,129 --> 01:10:01,095
That's off-limits,
as a subject goes, today.

1614
01:10:01,097 --> 01:10:04,065
Gregg: Well, if you're running
for a District Attorney job,

1615
01:10:04,067 --> 01:10:05,567
people should know
that you're an arsonist.

1616
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:07,902
I'm not an... How dare you,
calling me an arsonist?

1617
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:09,204
That's illegal,
what you're doing.

1618
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:10,605
- You're...
- You had ownership

1619
01:10:10,607 --> 01:10:14,008
in the film theater,
the Victorville Film Center,

1620
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,476
but that's different
than the archive,

1621
01:10:15,478 --> 01:10:16,878
- which I ran.
- Tim: That's not...

1622
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,413
- I ran the archive.
- That is irrelevant

1623
01:10:18,415 --> 01:10:20,114
- to this situation.
- Gregg: I ran both of them.

1624
01:10:20,116 --> 01:10:22,150
- Excuse me.
- Gregg: I ran both
the film center

1625
01:10:22,152 --> 01:10:23,218
and the film archive,

1626
01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,786
but you burned down
the film archive.

1627
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:25,853
You didn't run that.

1628
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:27,889
So don't tell these people
you have a small business

1629
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:29,524
in Victorville
because you never did.

1630
01:10:29,526 --> 01:10:31,426
That business didn't...
wouldn't exist without me...

1631
01:10:31,428 --> 01:10:32,894
- Gregg: You can't even name...
- ...actually.

1632
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:34,963
...three movies
that came out in the 1980s.

1633
01:10:34,965 --> 01:10:37,332
I'm not running for mayor
of Movie Town.

1634
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:39,300
I'm running
for District Attorney.

1635
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:41,336
You're delusional.
This guy, by the way,

1636
01:10:41,338 --> 01:10:45,373
is, like, obsessed
with collecting old videotapes.

1637
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:46,808
Nobody even watches videotapes
anymore.

1638
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:49,210
Gregg: Yeah, they do.
A lot of people have both.

1639
01:10:49,212 --> 01:10:52,080
Do you have a DVD player
or a di...

1640
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:54,449
- what is it? The VHS player?
- DVD.

1641
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:56,918
What do you got, DVD?
You guys a couple?

1642
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,753
You didn't run the film archive,
is my point,

1643
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,488
'cause you don't know
anything about movies,

1644
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,023
so you couldn't have
run a film archive.

1645
01:11:02,025 --> 01:11:05,093
What do you... what do you care?
Why are you here?

1646
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:06,894
- You're here to ruin me.
- Gregg: I'm here

1647
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:08,329
because I needed to give
something to

1648
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:10,198
- your cameraman...
- Shame on you.
This guy is a pig.

1649
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,433
He's coming... He's driven
in here from Hollywood...

1650
01:11:12,435 --> 01:11:14,402
- He's driven in here
from Hollywood...
- Gregg: So did you.

1651
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:16,170
- to disrupt the process.
- You don't live here.

1652
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:17,905
Tim: Huh? I do live here.
I live right here

1653
01:11:17,907 --> 01:11:20,108
- in this building.
I am a resident of the...
- Just 'cause you rented

1654
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,976
- a hotel room for a night...
- Tim: I'm a resident of...

1655
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:24,712
This is a work-home environment.
And I have my mail coming...

1656
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:26,914
How do I have my fucking mail
coming here...

1657
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:28,916
How do I have
my fucking mail coming here...

1658
01:11:28,918 --> 01:11:31,319
- Gregg: You could get P.O. box.
- ...if it's not where I live?

1659
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:35,923
- Rosetti owns a house.
- Stay out of this process.

1660
01:11:35,925 --> 01:11:38,793
That's my message.
So, I'm sorry.

1661
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:42,964
I apologize for the use
of the "F" word and, uh...

1662
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,966
Yes. Thank you.

1663
01:11:45,335 --> 01:11:48,469
I asked him to go,
and he didn't listen.

1664
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:49,971
Fuck!

1665
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,206
- Tim!
- I'm sorry!

1666
01:11:52,208 --> 01:11:54,876
I'm looking at you
the whole fucking way!

1667
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:56,644
Why don't you ask him
to get security...

1668
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:59,447
- get somebody
to get fucking security?
- Tim, calm down! Calm down!

1669
01:11:59,449 --> 01:12:01,416
- Fuck this!
- Toni: You can't use that word!

1670
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:04,118
I just wanted to get that
videotape back on the weekend,

1671
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,620
so I'll be in touch
with you guys.

1672
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:09,057
But go ahead and watch it
and then see what you think,

1673
01:12:09,059 --> 01:12:11,626
and I'll get it on the weekend.

1674
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:13,294
Okay. Thanks.

1675
01:12:13,296 --> 01:12:14,662
Rewind it.

1676
01:12:16,733 --> 01:12:18,933
Toni: So sorry, everybody,
for his outburst.

1677
01:12:18,935 --> 01:12:21,302
He's been under a lot of stress.

1678
01:12:21,304 --> 01:12:24,439
(indistinct chatter)

1679
01:12:24,441 --> 01:12:27,008
I'm sorry, everybody.
Thanks. I appreciate it.

1680
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,444
You don't understand.
I'm a very passionate guy.

1681
01:12:29,446 --> 01:12:30,945
I'm passionate for you guys.

1682
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:32,814
And it's been a lot of...
been a long time...

1683
01:12:32,816 --> 01:12:37,051
it's been a long, um,
couple of days, okay?

1684
01:12:37,253 --> 01:12:39,387
I am so sorry. (sniffles)

1685
01:12:40,757 --> 01:12:41,556
Thank you.

1686
01:12:41,558 --> 01:12:42,790
- Can we take some food?
- Yeah.

1687
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:44,225
- Toni: Absolutely.
- Tim: Help yourself.

1688
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:45,860
Toni: Please, help yourself.

1689
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,266
Thank you, guys.

1690
01:12:55,405 --> 01:12:58,239
We'll get them in...
We'll get out tomorrow

1691
01:12:58,241 --> 01:13:01,776
and get down there
and just get out there.

1692
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:03,411
I mean, there's not a lot
of people there,

1693
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:05,146
so it doesn't matter.
It's not like they're gonna...

1694
01:13:05,148 --> 01:13:06,614
If it was bad,
it would be 1000 people.

1695
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:09,117
- It'd be everybody
talking about...
- (watch chimes)

1696
01:13:09,986 --> 01:13:13,121
You guys are gonna need to take
a piss break or something.

1697
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:15,156
I got to be alone.

1698
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,365
Gregg: Oh, it's like,
I told you guys that Tim's nuts.

1699
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:26,033
Josh: Gregg, can you take
your hat off for a second?

1700
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:28,169
- Just the lights.
- Do I need to?

1701
01:13:28,171 --> 01:13:30,605
Josh: It's just casting a shadow
on your face.

1702
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:33,808
He goes in there, and he starts
dropping the VFA name

1703
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:35,476
to try to win voters over.

1704
01:13:35,478 --> 01:13:37,311
And it's not really fair
to movie buffs

1705
01:13:37,313 --> 01:13:39,280
that might think
they should vote for him

1706
01:13:39,282 --> 01:13:41,315
that he has something to do
with that archive,

1707
01:13:41,317 --> 01:13:42,817
other than having
caught it on fire.

1708
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:47,255
I told you that he was nuts
and you were wasting your time,

1709
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:48,322
and you didn't listen.

1710
01:13:48,324 --> 01:13:49,757
And now you're still
wasting your time

1711
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,325
'cause you want to talk
about him more.

1712
01:13:51,327 --> 01:13:53,361
What you should talk about
is the movies.

1713
01:13:53,363 --> 01:13:56,364
But you guys don't seem
too interested,

1714
01:13:56,366 --> 01:13:58,499
so best of luck to you.

1715
01:14:09,145 --> 01:14:12,814
Tim:<i> All right, well, is there</i>
<i> anybody else I can speak with?</i>

1716
01:14:12,816 --> 01:14:14,348
<i> Because...</i>
<i> You know what I mean?</i>

1717
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:18,753
Like, is there anybody above you
I can speak with?

1718
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:20,621
'Cause this seems like...

1719
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:26,561
If they're printed already,
is there not a way

1720
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:28,529
to hold the elect...

1721
01:14:28,531 --> 01:14:31,466
I don't know, stop...
like, delay the election

1722
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:32,900
until we can fix the mistake?

1723
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:36,003
Because... So,
what are you telling me?

1724
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,673
That I have to, what?

1725
01:14:38,675 --> 01:14:42,109
That they... Can they write
my name in at this point?

1726
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:45,446
If I'm not on the ballot,
how am I supposed to compete

1727
01:14:45,448 --> 01:14:47,815
if those two other fuckers
are on the ba...

1728
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:48,749
No. I apologize.

1729
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:52,053
If those two guys
are on the ballot, right?

1730
01:14:52,055 --> 01:14:55,756
So, you're...
This whole thing... You're...

1731
01:14:55,758 --> 01:14:58,292
This board of elections
in San Bernardino County...

1732
01:14:58,294 --> 01:15:00,561
I know.
You've won this round, I guess,

1733
01:15:00,563 --> 01:15:03,264
but I'm gonna get the word out
starting tonight.

1734
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:05,366
We're gonna start
making phone calls.

1735
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:09,737
Well, that's a little...
too little... little too late.

1736
01:15:09,806 --> 01:15:11,272
We're a little past that.

1737
01:15:11,274 --> 01:15:12,874
And if you guys would have been
more cooperative

1738
01:15:12,876 --> 01:15:17,712
from the beginning and...
then we wouldn't be here.

1739
01:15:17,714 --> 01:15:21,549
So, tell your boss
to go fuck himself.

1740
01:15:22,652 --> 01:15:24,886
Hello? Yeah.

1741
01:15:25,088 --> 01:15:27,188
- Great.
- Oh, Tim.

1742
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:29,991
Tim: You know, it's blank!
(sighs)

1743
01:15:30,293 --> 01:15:34,595
(inhales)

1744
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:35,997
Tim.

1745
01:15:37,433 --> 01:15:39,033
Okay, we're not on the ballot.

1746
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:44,705
We are a write-in candidacy.
It's an insurgency candidacy.

1747
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:48,476
And that's the news.

1748
01:15:48,578 --> 01:15:50,711
So, I'm gonna get some ice.

1749
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:54,782
- (thuds)
- Tim! Jesus Christ.

1750
01:15:54,784 --> 01:15:57,885
- (scoffs)
- (door opens)

1751
01:16:02,191 --> 01:16:04,358
(Tim sighs)

1752
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,676
Oh, my God.

1753
01:16:21,678 --> 01:16:26,080
- (pounds on door)
- Tim: Toni?

1754
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:29,016
- Toni: Tim? Tim?
- Hey, I'm sorry.

1755
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:30,384
Toni: You have to calm down,
Tim.

1756
01:16:30,386 --> 01:16:32,286
- I'm calm. I'm sorry.
- Toni: Calm down.

1757
01:16:32,288 --> 01:16:35,890
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Stop throwing things.

1758
01:16:35,892 --> 01:16:39,627
I didn't... I just threw a beer.
I'm not being violent.

1759
01:16:39,629 --> 01:16:41,228
(Tim sighs)

1760
01:16:43,032 --> 01:16:44,098
Toni: I... I...

1761
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:49,136
I don't even know what to say
to any of this at this point.

1762
01:16:50,173 --> 01:16:51,038
Tim: Yeah.

1763
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,975
Well, I need a little bit
of space right now.

1764
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:56,010
So why don't you, um...

1765
01:16:56,212 --> 01:16:57,678
why don't you give me that
right now?

1766
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:00,514
I think I just need...
I need a little bit of...

1767
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:03,284
I need a little bit
of space, so...

1768
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:06,520
Do you want to just give me
a little bit of that?

1769
01:17:06,589 --> 01:17:08,089
Of course.

1770
01:17:09,993 --> 01:17:11,292
Yeah.

1771
01:17:13,463 --> 01:17:15,262
(Toni sighs)

1772
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:36,917
(door closes)

1773
01:17:42,892 --> 01:17:46,360

And it was a good, hard race.

1806
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,233
And you won.

1807
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:10,171
I know that you were behind
many of the tricks

1808
01:20:10,173 --> 01:20:13,040
that you screwed me
with getting...

1809
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:18,145
shutting my... shutting down
the press and everything else.

1810
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:19,580
And, uh...

1811
01:20:19,582 --> 01:20:22,349
uh... you uh...

1812
01:20:22,685 --> 01:20:24,285
you suck, you know?

1813
01:20:24,287 --> 01:20:28,255
And you...
you had the easiest case ever

1814
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:31,826
in the history of courts
against me,

1815
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:34,461
and you had the smoking gun,

1816
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:36,030
and you couldn't even
close that.

1817
01:20:36,032 --> 01:20:39,266
So, just... You got to sleep
with that shit.

1818
01:20:39,268 --> 01:20:43,737
And I'm gonna get you
next election cycle.

1819
01:20:43,739 --> 01:20:44,738
(phone clicks)

1820
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:49,176
We're living in a culture
that is more and more about...

1821
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:55,816
what's glittery,
style over substance.

1822
01:20:55,818 --> 01:20:59,286
And Mr. Heidecker brought that
into the courtroom.

1823
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:03,224
We don't value substance.
We don't value character.

1824
01:21:03,226 --> 01:21:05,526
I mean,
Mr. Heidecker's character,

1825
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:07,528
as far as I'm concerned, is nil.

1826
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:10,064
There is no character there.

1827
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:12,066
I lost my heart...

1828
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:16,070
for the courtroom after that.

1829
01:21:16,072 --> 01:21:18,105
<i> Once you lose that</i>
<i> sense of purpose...</i>

1830
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:20,908
<i> I don't care</i>
<i> what profession you're in...</i>

1831
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:23,177
<i> it's time to move on.</i>

1832
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,848
Tim: So, this is, uh...

1833
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:31,085
this is it. This is the spot.

1834
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:33,520
It's the site
of the Electric Sun, uh,

1835
01:21:33,522 --> 01:21:35,456
20 music festival...

1836
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:39,560
that they've condemned,
but you can sneak in here.

1837
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:46,000
I haven't really been back here
since that night.

1838
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:50,938
This place was a...
was just filled with bodies.

1839
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,106
That's, like, my last memory

1840
01:21:52,108 --> 01:21:54,174
'cause I was kind of
buzzed myself.

1841
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:57,845
So I was seeing, sort of,
flashes of...

1842
01:21:58,414 --> 01:22:01,782
sick kids and, you know...

1843
01:22:01,784 --> 01:22:04,685
I don't know how much
you want to talk about that.

1844
01:22:04,687 --> 01:22:06,086
(sighs)

1845
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:09,290
You know, shit happens.

1846
01:22:14,864 --> 01:22:17,031
It was, you know,
one of those bittersweet things

1847
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:21,101
because it... it was such
a horrible, tragic event

1848
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:22,636
<i> that we would take back</i>
<i> in a minute,</i>

1849
01:22:22,638 --> 01:22:25,339
<i> but at the same time,</i>
<i> it got me to this place</i>

1850
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:26,974
<i> where I was able to come out</i>

1851
01:22:26,976 --> 01:22:29,209
<i> and get in the ring,</i>
<i> get in the arena.</i>

1852
01:22:29,211 --> 01:22:33,614
<i> And, um, as much as I lost,</i>
<i> you know, and didn't...</i>

1853
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:35,749
<i> didn't win,</i>
<i> that's the risk I took.</i>

1854
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:39,687
<i> And that is not something</i>
<i> I would ever change.</i>

1855
01:22:39,689 --> 01:22:41,755
<i> I wouldn't change a thing.</i>

1856
01:22:41,991 --> 01:22:45,759
If they're doing...
they would have counted the...

1857
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:49,063
the absentee ballots
and everything like that, right,

1858
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:52,299
like, the provisional
ballots and... Yeah.

1859
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,034
<i> I fought fair,</i>
<i> I fought honestly,</i>

1860
01:22:54,036 --> 01:23:00,908
and you know, I should probably
give Rosetti a concession call.

1861
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:01,976
(sniffles) Um...

1862
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:05,679
You know? I guess that's the...
the right thing to do, which...

1863
01:23:05,681 --> 01:23:07,548
You know, I should have done
that last night.

1864
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:10,050
I'm gonna do something,
and you can film it or not.

1865
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:14,221
I don't care.
I just... saw this.

1866
01:23:20,997 --> 01:23:24,098
This is for the Electric Sun 19,

1867
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:31,071
who accidentally overdosed
on medicine that was...

1868
01:23:31,073 --> 01:23:34,041
that was tainted
by the Chinese government.

1869
01:23:34,043 --> 01:23:36,910
And, uh, I'm sorry that I...

1870
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:41,415
that I was in any way connected
with it and that I was a...

1871
01:23:41,417 --> 01:23:44,284
a bystander
to the massacre here.

1872
01:23:44,453 --> 01:23:45,853
And forever we...

1873
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:49,323
we know that you guys
are looking down on us, and...

1874
01:23:51,394 --> 01:23:54,561
you know, we wish you were
with us today.

1875
01:23:54,964 --> 01:23:57,564
Let me put that here.

1876
01:24:04,507 --> 01:24:06,974
Does this work if I stand it up?

1877
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:18,285
How's this look?
Can you get this and...

1878
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:20,454
Can you get the flowers,

1879
01:24:20,456 --> 01:24:24,858
if you rake up from flowers
to me, mountains, sky?

1880
01:24:26,662 --> 01:24:29,596
That's your.. probably
your end shot, right?

1881
01:24:29,598 --> 01:24:30,764
Dedicated... Something with text

1882
01:24:30,766 --> 01:24:33,967
dedicated to the memory
of the Electric Sun 19?

1883
01:24:36,605 --> 01:24:38,238
Something like that?

1884
01:24:38,674 --> 01:24:42,309
Yup. Okay, cool. Great.
We got it? Cool.

1885
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:44,344
I think that'll play nice
as your ending.

1886
01:24:44,346 --> 01:24:47,481
I don't want to tell you
what to do, but if you can

1887
01:24:47,483 --> 01:24:48,549
just send me a rough cut

1888
01:24:48,551 --> 01:24:51,151
and I'll give you notes, um,
that would be great.

1889
01:24:51,153 --> 01:24:52,719
I think you guys did
a great job.

1890
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:55,122
From what I could see,
everything looked great.

1891
01:24:55,124 --> 01:24:56,857
I wish you would have gotten
a version where I won.

1892
01:24:56,859 --> 01:24:58,926
That would have made,
probably, a more interesting

1893
01:24:58,928 --> 01:24:59,960
documentary for you.

1894
01:24:59,962 --> 01:25:02,196
But maybe next time
you can follow me around

1895
01:25:02,198 --> 01:25:03,297
on my next adventure,

1896
01:25:03,299 --> 01:25:06,834
"Whale Man," or whatever it is,
run for governor.

1897
01:25:06,836 --> 01:25:10,938
- (watch chimes)
- Tim: Ah! That's Toni.

1898
01:25:11,006 --> 01:25:14,074
Okay, I got to call her.
She wants to talk.

1899
01:25:14,577 --> 01:25:15,943
But that's just sort of me
and her,

1900
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:19,580
so that's a wrap on this,
I believe, don't you think?

1901
01:25:20,182 --> 01:25:21,915
- Josh: Yep.
- Tim: Okay.

1902
01:25:21,917 --> 01:25:26,053
And don't use any of that shit
with Gregg, you know...

1903
01:25:26,055 --> 01:25:28,989
or the stuff
in the hotel room with the...

1904
01:25:28,991 --> 01:25:33,660
Just keep it... Keep it
sort of positive, I think.

1905
01:25:34,563 --> 01:25:35,929
Good luck.

1906
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:43,036
<i> ¶ Useless ¶</i>
