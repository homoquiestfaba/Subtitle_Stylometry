1
00:00:00,309 --> 00:00:04,142
(dramatic instrumental music)

2
00:00:35,996 --> 00:00:38,962
- So the month of February

3
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:41,095
Canis Major is sitting in the south.

4
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:44,381
(instrumental piano music)

5
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:47,023
Sirius is prominent in the evening sky.

6
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:51,122
(instrumental piano music continues)

7
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:51,955
Perfect.

8
00:00:54,077 --> 00:00:56,629
Sirius, the Dog Star,

9
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:59,540
his colors are magnificent.

10
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,279
As its light is broken up
in a multitude of ways,

11
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:06,039
as it makes it's way
through the atmosphere.

12
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:07,359
Perfect.

13
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,524
Sirius, perfect.

14
00:01:09,524 --> 00:01:14,348
(thunder rumbles)
The shiniest, brightest star,

15
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:15,431
the Dog Star.

16
00:01:16,305 --> 00:01:20,304
- I'm Sirius, the Dog Star.
- Dog Star,

17
00:01:20,304 --> 00:01:22,808
the flaming snout of Orion,

18
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:25,225
8.6 million light-years away.

19
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:31,313
Orion was the most handsome
man who ever lived.

20
00:01:31,313 --> 00:01:33,782
His two hunting dogs,

21
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:36,532
companions snappin' at his heels.

22
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:40,839
The Dog Star.
(thunder rumbles)

23
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:45,839
(Dad exhales loudly)
(gentle instrumental music)

24
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:49,315
- Dad?

25
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:52,145
- Just goes on forever and ever.

26
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,332
It never ends, it never ends.

27
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:58,132
- [Young Dogstar] It's infinite.

28
00:01:58,132 --> 00:01:59,751
- [Marcus] It just goes on,

29
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:02,307
and on, and on.
- Goes on and on

30
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:04,222
forever and ever?

31
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:08,722
(gentle instrumental music continues)

32
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:11,469
(car engine rubles)
(rocks crunching)

33
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:14,802
(female speaks faintly)

34
00:03:18,385 --> 00:03:20,303
(car door clatters)

35
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:22,593
(car doors thud shut)

36
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:25,926
(indistinct chattering)

37
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:30,699
(trunk clatters shut)

38
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:32,284
- Who's that?

39
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:33,659
- That's Dogstar.

40
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,855
- [Gabrielle] Oh, oh, so
it's Dogstar's birthday?

41
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:36,988
- Yeah.

42
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:38,340
- Hey, Dogstar!

43
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,899
Happy birthday!
- Come on.

44
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:45,399
(gentle instrumental music continues)

45
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:49,092
(chimes tinkle)
- Hello?

46
00:03:49,092 --> 00:03:53,592
(gentle instrumental music continues)

47
00:04:20,235 --> 00:04:23,568
(Dogstar clicks tongue)

48
00:04:31,657 --> 00:04:33,009
(mellow instrumental music)
- Just goes on

49
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,860
forever and ever.
- It never ends.

50
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,777
Never ends.

51
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:45,903
(mellow instrumental music continues)

52
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:55,139
- Oh!

53
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,349
I didn't realize you were waiting.

54
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:00,207
- But it's true, I was waitin'.

55
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:01,318
I was in a state of readiness,

56
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:03,555
a state of anticipation.
(Gabrielle laughs)

57
00:05:03,555 --> 00:05:05,581
I only wait for things I
think may be important.

58
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:07,003
- Oh-'kay.

59
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:10,670
(gentle instrumental music)

60
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:48,097
Hey.

61
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,965
You guys need any help?

62
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:52,045
- Would you get Dogstar for me?

63
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:54,045
- Oh, sure, sure.
- Okay.

64
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:00,280
(whispers indistinctly)
(both chuckle)

65
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,197
(dramatic instrumental music)

66
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,443
(door clatters)

67
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:18,575
(dramatic instrumental music continues)

68
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:20,086
(door thuds shut)
(Gabrielle scoffs)

69
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:20,919
- Hello?

70
00:06:24,234 --> 00:06:26,533
(knocking on door)

71
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:30,200
(gentle instrumental music)

72
00:06:41,402 --> 00:06:42,902
I'm really hungry.

73
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:54,536
(plate clatters)

74
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:56,216
- Hi.
- Oh, hi,

75
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,056
(Gabrielle speaks indistinctly)

76
00:06:58,056 --> 00:06:59,798
- Would you take this for me?
- Hey, mom.

77
00:06:59,798 --> 00:07:00,631
- Thank you.

78
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:02,511
Oh!
- What should I take?

79
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:06,068
- Just have a seat.
- Oh, I'll take that.

80
00:07:06,068 --> 00:07:10,353
(Gabrielle speaks indistinctly)

81
00:07:10,353 --> 00:07:11,950
Right here?
- Yeah, that's fine.

82
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,783
Perfect!

83
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:16,225
- [Arnold] Anything else, anything else?

84
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:17,975
- [Beth] No, my love.

85
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:24,126
(groaning)
(female laughs)

86
00:07:24,126 --> 00:07:25,641
- Thanks.

87
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:29,233
(liquid sploshes)

88
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:33,066
(dramatic instrumental music)

89
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:39,763
- You're the one with the birthday?

90
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:41,375
- Sorry, what is your name?

91
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:45,004
- Happy birthday.
(Arnold chuckles)

92
00:07:45,004 --> 00:07:46,671
I got you a present.

93
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:52,395
- This is Arnold, a hot new star in town.

94
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:53,961
- Hello, Arnold.

95
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:55,586
- Dogstar, I hear there's a comet coming.

96
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:56,836
Is it here yet?

97
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:00,574
- Hello, Gabrielle.

98
00:08:03,855 --> 00:08:05,452
(dishes clang)
- So Dogstar,

99
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:06,593
happy birthday, mate.

100
00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:08,013
Listen, I didn't have
to get you a present,

101
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:08,846
but, you know,

102
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:10,015
figured you're gettin'
a bit old for all that.

103
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:11,725
- No, you're just getting too cheap.

104
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:12,685
- So where's yours then?

105
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:13,518
Bring it on.

106
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:15,753
- After dinner, we always
get it after dinner.

107
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:16,586
- Why wait?

108
00:08:16,586 --> 00:08:18,187
- Happy birthday.

109
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:21,020
(Arnold stammers)

110
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:23,787
- [Beth] All right,
does everyone have wine?

111
00:08:23,787 --> 00:08:25,119
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

112
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,786
- Let us give thanks

113
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:30,157
for the provision of food,

114
00:08:30,157 --> 00:08:30,990
and thanks for

115
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,709
the joyous company.
- Thank you all very much.

116
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:33,558
Thank you.
- Thanks.

117
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:35,236
- Thank you.
- Amen.

118
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:36,917
- Mom, is dad coming?

119
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,134
(Astro chuckles)

120
00:08:38,134 --> 00:08:40,367
- He'll be along in just a minute, mate.

121
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:41,604
- [Beth] I think he's in India,

122
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,437
is he?
(Cassy scoffs)

123
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:45,643
- He's probably off finding
himself again or something.

124
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:47,155
- Are you eating properly?

125
00:08:47,155 --> 00:08:49,001
- He likes to be a starving poet.

126
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:50,185
- Thank you.
- Poeta nascitur,

127
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:51,934
non fit, right, Arnie?

128
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:53,416
- If that's true, then there's no hope.

129
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,249
- There's only no hope

130
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:56,406
if you have to reform those who are evil.

131
00:08:56,406 --> 00:08:58,151
In my opinion, reform is a waste of time.

132
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:00,296
We should simply lock 'em
up, and throw away the key.

133
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:01,975
- Are you saying, people
are just born one way,

134
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,951
a poet or a criminal, and
you can't change them?

135
00:09:03,951 --> 00:09:06,703
- Yes dear, poeta nascitur, non fit.

136
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:07,616
We are what we are.

137
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:09,675
No point in trying to reform evil.

138
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:12,290
- Well, some people do bad
things 'cause they're desperate,

139
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,477
like hungry or something.

140
00:09:13,477 --> 00:09:15,577
- [Astro] Yes, but I think
the point here really is,

141
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:17,621
why would they be desperate
in the first place?

142
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:19,674
- So you're saying only
bad people get desperate?

143
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:20,681
- [Cassy] Good point.

144
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:21,530
Come on then.

145
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,372
- No, not really a good point at all.

146
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:25,474
The point is, that we are born how we are.

147
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:26,738
Nature not nurture.

148
00:09:26,738 --> 00:09:29,192
Nor more can a bricklayer
deny his true destiny

149
00:09:29,192 --> 00:09:30,158
than can a poet.

150
00:09:30,158 --> 00:09:31,429
- You know it reminds me of a story of

151
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:33,540
"The Turtle and Scorpion",

152
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,427
and the scorpion wants to
get across the river, right?

153
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:38,013
So he asked the turtle,
- Pass the bread.

154
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:39,692
- And he turtle says,
"Okay, but don't sting me",

155
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:40,622
and the scorpion says,

156
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,764
"I won't, 'cause I wanna
get across the river".

157
00:09:42,764 --> 00:09:44,732
Anyway, they get to the middle,

158
00:09:44,732 --> 00:09:46,538
and they're out in the middle,
- Pass the butter,

159
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:47,371
would you, sweetheart?

160
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:49,657
- [Gabrielle] and the
Scorpion stings the turtle,

161
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:50,749
and they both sink.

162
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:52,502
- Scorpions always sting.

163
00:09:52,502 --> 00:09:54,286
- Yeah, and turtles are always stupid.

164
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:55,725
So you agree with me then, Gabrielle?

165
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,391
- No, I like turtles.
- Well, we can't help

166
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:58,581
contemplating our existence.

167
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:00,859
It's the only thing that
separates us from the rocks.

168
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:01,838
(Gabriel laughs)

169
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:03,004
- [Astro] Now, there's
a lot of crap out there.

170
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:04,213
People are looking for answers,

171
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:06,062
and producing nothing but junk.

172
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:08,086
- [Cassy] That's just your opinion.

173
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:10,226
- Have you got anything to add, brother?

174
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:11,059
(bowl clangs)

175
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:15,099
- Mom, you make the
most incredible dinner.

176
00:10:15,099 --> 00:10:15,932
(Arnold laughs)

177
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:17,169
- Good.
- Yeah, really good, mom.

178
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:18,792
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Very good.

179
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:20,645
- The garden of science and of truth,

180
00:10:20,645 --> 00:10:23,178
of these subjects, what
have you got to say?

181
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:24,311
- Don't be mean.

182
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:25,246
- Mean, what's mean?

183
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:26,986
He's a grown man, he has opinions.

184
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:27,819
- You're a bully!

185
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:29,004
- [Astro] I'm purely interested.

186
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,945
- No, Cassy, it's all right.

187
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:36,112
See, if people are constantly
wrestling with life,

188
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,675
and searching for answers,

189
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:43,172
then, of course, they're
gonna find some comfort

190
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:45,839
in philosophy, religion, in art.

191
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,702
- Oh, I find no comfort in it.

192
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:52,119
- I just think that accepting

193
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,677
that there is no one single
finite answer to anything

194
00:10:58,763 --> 00:11:01,930
is the hardest thing for people to do.

195
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:06,701
- So in your book, it's
absurd to even conceive God?

196
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:10,618
- Absurd, Astro, my dear
brother, is your word.

197
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:17,340
Me, I just happen to
really love my dinner.

198
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:24,458
(all chuckling)

199
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,321
- Happy birthday, my dear Dogstar.

200
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:29,078
- Well, maybe I should
take this opportunity

201
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:30,117
to kiss you now?

202
00:11:30,117 --> 00:11:31,514
- Do you ever rest?

203
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:32,584
- Astro?

204
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:34,295
- You know what they say,
the lovely Cassiopeia,

205
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,763
"Ars longa, vita brevis".

206
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:36,963
- Up your ass, too.

207
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,968
- Go on, give us a little kiss.

208
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:42,527
- Astro, she does not wanna kiss you.

209
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:44,944
- Are you suffering from lack of love?

210
00:11:44,944 --> 00:11:46,413
Here, I'll kiss you.

211
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,777
(smooches)

212
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:48,699
- Listen, that reminds me,

213
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:50,256
I'm a little bit short of cash this week.

214
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:53,554
Have you got any I could borrow?

215
00:11:53,554 --> 00:11:57,221
(gentle instrumental music)

216
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:04,699
(water splashes)

217
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:07,873
(object clangs)

218
00:12:07,873 --> 00:12:09,930
(dishes clatter)

219
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,430
(gentle instrumental music continues)

220
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:23,855
(cups clang)

221
00:12:23,855 --> 00:12:27,522
(water continues splashing)

222
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:33,084
(dishes clang and clatter)

223
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:34,546
(cabinet door thuds shut)

224
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:38,213
(water continues splashing)

225
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:49,925
- There, all done.

226
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:53,545
I actually enjoyed that.

227
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,103
(footsteps clomping)

228
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,297
- Gabrielle, Mark's waiting.

229
00:13:07,297 --> 00:13:08,209
Do you wanna come with us to the studio?

230
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:11,176
We could rehearse, and you
could sing or something.

231
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:12,842
- Sure.
- Where's Beth?

232
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:13,675
- She went somewhere

233
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:14,734
with Arnold.
(Cassy scoffs)

234
00:13:14,734 --> 00:13:15,574
- Just-
- I like her.

235
00:13:15,574 --> 00:13:16,730
She's cool.
- I wish she'd act her age.

236
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:21,107
Come on.
(footsteps descending)

237
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:23,940
(gravel crunches)

238
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:29,813
- Dad?
(guitar strums upbeat tune)

239
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:55,671
(gravel crunches)
- It never ends.

240
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:57,118
Never ends.

241
00:13:57,118 --> 00:13:58,035
Never ends.

242
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,975
(Dogstar exhales loudly)

243
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:14,506
(chair creaks)

244
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:17,749
(Dogstar sighs loudly)

245
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:19,499
- Oh, are you hungry?

246
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,236
Did I forget about you?

247
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:31,847
Would you like a red one or a green one?

248
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:39,721
(Dogstar sighs loudly)

249
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:42,828
Do you think she was a
little shooting star?

250
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,257
What?

251
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:45,327
What?

252
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:46,160
Serious B?

253
00:14:47,545 --> 00:14:49,589
You must be out of your mind.

254
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:51,731
Is your food out of date?

255
00:14:51,731 --> 00:14:53,648
Are you tripping on me?

256
00:14:54,882 --> 00:14:56,382
You little terror.

257
00:14:57,962 --> 00:14:59,462
You little terror.

258
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:05,245
(Dogstar exhales loudly)

259
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:07,956
(Dogstar groans)

260
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:11,623
(gentle instrumental music)

261
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:28,108
(tinging)

262
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:30,754
- Dogstar!

263
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,576
(rock tings)

264
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:35,409
Dogstar!

265
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,041
Hi, Dogstar.

266
00:15:50,591 --> 00:15:51,424
Dogstar!

267
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:54,878
Dogstar, it's me Gabbi.

268
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,123
Hey.

269
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:02,506
Oops.

270
00:16:02,506 --> 00:16:03,339
It's big.

271
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:08,977
(footsteps clomping)
Dogstar?

272
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:12,096
(Gabrielle thuds)

273
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,611
Dogstar?

274
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:18,611
(footsteps clomping)
(Gabrielle sighs)

275
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:21,813
I brought you a present.

276
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:22,983
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

277
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,108
(Dogstar imitates popping sound)

278
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:28,509
I'm tired.
(Dogstar groans)

279
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:30,757
- Very lovely.
(footsteps clomp)

280
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:31,757
Very lovely.

281
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:36,674
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.

282
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,418

00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:45,600

00:22:58,131 --> 00:23:01,040
Listen, have got any money I could borrow?

365
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,343
- She'll be back later.

366
00:23:02,343 --> 00:23:04,515
(Astro scoffs)
(fingers snapping)

367
00:23:04,515 --> 00:23:05,935
- Looks like you had a rough night.

368
00:23:05,935 --> 00:23:08,018
What have you been up to?

369
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:10,585
Hmm, well, listen,

370
00:23:12,203 --> 00:23:13,519
maybe she left it out for me?

371
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,857
Hey, where's the show?
(door clatters shut)

372
00:23:15,857 --> 00:23:18,770
(knocking on door)

373
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,603
- Go away.

374
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:25,772
(Gabrielle exhales loudly)

375
00:23:25,772 --> 00:23:27,830
What's wrong with you?

376
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,370
- I'm orbiting, man.
(object clangs)

377
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,037
Everything is right.

378
00:23:34,322 --> 00:23:36,040
(Nicky groans)

379
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,748
(Nicky exhales loudly)

380
00:23:39,748 --> 00:23:40,665
I love you.

381
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,207
- I love you too, Nick.

382
00:23:45,806 --> 00:23:47,139
- Are you happy?

383
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:49,745
(Gabrielle chuckles)

384
00:23:49,745 --> 00:23:50,578
- Mm-mmm.

385
00:23:52,423 --> 00:23:54,423
- What are you gonna do?

386
00:23:57,115 --> 00:23:59,868
(Gabrielle exhales loudly)

387
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:01,358
I want you to be happy.

388
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:02,191
I'm happy.

389
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:05,327
- I'm glad for you.

390
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,626
- I wanna make you happy.

391
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:09,793
I wanna help you be happy.

392
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,514
(bag clatters)

393
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:17,598
You'd never hurt me.

394
00:24:17,598 --> 00:24:20,598
- Everything's gonna be okay, right?

395
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:26,102
(objects in bag clatter)

396
00:24:26,102 --> 00:24:27,102
I feel sick.

397
00:24:29,563 --> 00:24:31,230
- Are you happy now?

398
00:24:32,157 --> 00:24:37,157
(Gabrielle sighs loudly)
- Never felt happier.

399
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:47,476
- From that first big bang,

400
00:24:47,476 --> 00:24:49,893
an eternal Titanic explosion,

401
00:24:51,393 --> 00:24:54,560
stars rushing away from us, expanding,

402
00:24:57,283 --> 00:25:00,129
like being flung out like

403
00:25:00,129 --> 00:25:03,712
droplets of water off
a shaking dog's back.

404
00:25:06,986 --> 00:25:09,153
(tinging)

405
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:30,607
(Dogstar breathes heavily)

406
00:25:32,886 --> 00:25:35,719
(object clatters)

407
00:25:43,662 --> 00:25:47,412
(Gabrielle thuds and groans)

408
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:49,981
- I feel happy here.

409
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:55,394
(Gabrielle sighs)

410
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:59,018
- I told you she'd be back, didn't I?

411
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:01,452
I knew you'd be back,

412
00:26:01,452 --> 00:26:04,035
'cause you left something here.

413
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:06,621
You left it in my bed,

414
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:08,038
- Oh.
- in my bed.

415
00:26:09,495 --> 00:26:10,662
- I need that.

416
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,407
- I drew it for you.

417
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:16,353
- Thank you.

418
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,336
Can I sleep here tonight?

419
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:24,477
(Dogstar clears throat)

420
00:26:24,477 --> 00:26:26,073
- Before we go any further,

421
00:26:26,073 --> 00:26:27,041
I think you and I should

422
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:31,119
get something straight
between us, all right?

423
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,285
What I wanna know is, are you in trouble?

424
00:26:34,285 --> 00:26:35,118
- No.
- You're in trouble,

425
00:26:35,118 --> 00:26:35,951
aren't you?

426
00:26:35,951 --> 00:26:38,034
- No, I just wanna sleep.

427
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,862
- Oh.

428
00:26:43,031 --> 00:26:45,091
Oh, it's all right then.

429
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:46,727
(Gabrielle groans)
You can stay.

430
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:47,727
- Thank you.

431
00:26:49,815 --> 00:26:50,648
Dogstar?

432
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:55,418
You never go out, do you?

433
00:26:57,753 --> 00:26:58,753
- No, never.

434
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:01,231
- It's okay.

435
00:27:02,729 --> 00:27:05,062
You should always stay here.

436
00:27:19,361 --> 00:27:21,704
I feel sorry for it.

437
00:27:21,704 --> 00:27:22,888
- [Dogstar] Why?

438
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:24,709
- [Gabrielle] I'd hate to
be trapped in small space

439
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,859
going 'round and 'round like that.

440
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:28,539
- [Dogstar] Oh, it
doesn't remember its way

441
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:30,188
from one side to the other.

442
00:27:30,188 --> 00:27:31,941
- [Gabrielle] It remembers how to swim.

443
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:36,152
- [Dogstar] He doesn't
have much choice, does he?

444
00:27:36,152 --> 00:27:40,153
- The world beyond the
bowl must seem endless.

445
00:27:40,153 --> 00:27:41,903
You think it wonders?

446
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:47,043
I dream about floating in big oceans

447
00:27:47,043 --> 00:27:50,098
full of colorful fish and sea plants,

448
00:27:50,098 --> 00:27:52,502
and when I wake up,

449
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:54,393
I can remember how beautiful it was,

450
00:27:54,393 --> 00:27:58,161
but I can't quite see it
like it was in my dreams.

451
00:27:58,161 --> 00:27:58,994
Oh, god.

452
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:01,270
I can't believe that...

453
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,023
I can't believe that I just showed up here

454
00:28:03,023 --> 00:28:03,989
in the middle of the night,

455
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:05,522
and I slept in your bed,

456
00:28:05,522 --> 00:28:07,107
and I've taken a shower,

457
00:28:07,107 --> 00:28:09,723
and said all this really stupid stuff.

458
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:12,871
- Well, I don't get very many visitors.

459
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:17,839
- [Gabrielle] I mean, I hardly
even know you, and here I am.

460
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,756
- I know, here you are.

461
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:23,886
- I should go.

462
00:28:26,463 --> 00:28:27,296
Should I?

463
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:31,920
- Do you wanna go?

464
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,337
- You want me to?

465
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,753
- Goldie and I might miss you if you go.

466
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,523
(Gabrielle sighs loudly)

467
00:28:41,523 --> 00:28:44,523
(melancholic music)

468
00:28:46,743 --> 00:28:48,410
- Here, put it back.

469
00:28:52,506 --> 00:28:53,339
- Thanks.

470
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:58,933
- Like a shiny, bright new star.

471
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,455
- You are a star too.

472
00:29:03,497 --> 00:29:04,580
What are you?

473
00:29:06,315 --> 00:29:07,148
- Sirius.

474
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:09,130
- Sirius?

475
00:29:10,493 --> 00:29:12,858
- Sirius, the Dog Star.

476
00:29:12,858 --> 00:29:14,273
- The Dog Star.

477
00:29:14,273 --> 00:29:15,106
- Show me.

478
00:29:20,293 --> 00:29:21,561
Oh, I can't see anything.

479
00:29:21,561 --> 00:29:22,394
You look.

480
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:23,948
- [Dogstar] Let's not fret.

481
00:29:23,948 --> 00:29:24,781
(Dogstar mumbles)

482
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:25,762
- Okay.
- Okay.

483
00:29:25,762 --> 00:29:26,991
(Dogstar mumbles)
- Like here?

484
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:28,335
- Yeah.
- Okay.

485
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:31,835
- And just tell me when you see something.

486
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:35,926
(Dogstar mumbles)

487
00:29:35,926 --> 00:29:37,695
(Gabrielle chuckles)
Maybe?

488
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:38,612
Hold still.

489
00:29:39,508 --> 00:29:41,675
- It's a very bright star.

490
00:29:51,035 --> 00:29:54,702
(gentle instrumental music)

491
00:30:36,186 --> 00:30:39,103
(Gabrielle coughs)

492
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:44,723
(car engine roars)

493
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:48,639
(car door clatters)

494
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:52,032
(car door slams shut)

495
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:55,782
(Gabrielle breathes heavily)

496
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:06,985
(gears clatter)

497
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:11,118
(car engine whirs)

498
00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:18,128
Nicky?

499
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:19,976
- Where have you been?

500
00:31:19,976 --> 00:31:21,866
What time is it?

501
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:23,518
- Nicky, you gotta help me.

502
00:31:23,518 --> 00:31:25,813
(Nicky moans)
- Sure, baby.

503
00:31:25,813 --> 00:31:26,646
Sure.

504
00:31:27,922 --> 00:31:29,279
- Nicky, don't go back to sleep.

505
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,859
(Nicky sighs loudly)
- We'll take care of you.

506
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:34,692
Do you have any money?

507
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:41,555
- [Astro] Einstein said, "Science
without religion is lame,

508
00:31:41,555 --> 00:31:44,339
religion without science is blind".

509
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:45,504
- You're good at remembering

510
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:47,543
what other people say, aren't you?

511
00:31:47,543 --> 00:31:50,210
- If it interests me, only then.

512
00:31:51,091 --> 00:31:52,489
So how's your little show going?

513
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:54,347
Anyone actually turn
up for that, did they?

514
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:56,481
- Ah, he's doing amazing.

515
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,254
There are two galleries in Los Angeles

516
00:31:58,254 --> 00:32:00,226
that's gonna show his work.

517
00:32:00,226 --> 00:32:02,970
- Your mom's been very special to me.

518
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:03,887
- I'll bet.

519
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,551
Where did that girl go, by the way?

520
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:08,241
- I don't know.

521
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:09,701
- She's very quiet.

522
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:11,255
- Oh, I like that, though.

523
00:32:11,255 --> 00:32:13,167
Quiet and calm on the surface,

524
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,466
a raging volcano underneath.

525
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,628
- You like to provoke people, don't you?

526
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:19,078
- Only by provoking people

527
00:32:19,078 --> 00:32:22,660
can we reveal their true natures.

528
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,605
Anything to add, brother,

529
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:25,651
or is the construction of the zen garden

530
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:28,018
keeping you a bit occupied right now?

531
00:32:28,018 --> 00:32:31,546
- Only your true nature is
revealed by provoking people.

532
00:32:31,546 --> 00:32:32,533
- What?

533
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,366
What?

534
00:32:33,366 --> 00:32:34,957
I can't even hear him.

535
00:32:34,957 --> 00:32:39,490
- Only your true nature is
revealed by provoking people!

536
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,643
(utensil clangs)

537
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:43,205
- Don't you ever wanna get
to the bottom of things?

538
00:32:43,205 --> 00:32:45,286
Disagree with inconsistencies?

539
00:32:45,286 --> 00:32:47,049
Make small-minded people

540
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:48,986
see the small-mindness of their ways?

541
00:32:48,986 --> 00:32:49,819
- Honey.
- Do you never

542
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:51,843
wanna get to-
- Typical type A personality.

543
00:32:51,843 --> 00:32:54,447
You'll die young if you're not careful.

544
00:32:54,447 --> 00:32:56,592
- Whom the gods love, die young.

545
00:32:56,592 --> 00:32:58,726
- Ah, but you don't believe in God.

546
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,120
- It's a saying, Arnold.

547
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,703
It's just a saying.

548
00:33:03,368 --> 00:33:04,211
- Where is he going?

549
00:33:04,211 --> 00:33:05,074
- You know what?

550
00:33:05,074 --> 00:33:06,082
That's about the smartest thing

551
00:33:06,082 --> 00:33:07,763
that's ever come out of your mouth.

552
00:33:07,763 --> 00:33:09,083
Where does he ever go?

553
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,384
- He's a funny one.

554
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:12,287
He's a funny one.

555
00:33:12,287 --> 00:33:13,718
- Everything's so funny, funny, funny.

556
00:33:13,718 --> 00:33:15,011
(food clangs)
(Arnold sighs)

557
00:33:15,011 --> 00:33:17,435
- Please, now, there is
nothing wrong with him.

558
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:20,595
The world's just a little too
noisy for him, that's all.

559
00:33:20,595 --> 00:33:21,719
- Well, whatever.

560
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:23,088
Listen, can I borrow a little bit of cash?

561
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:25,208
I'm just a bit short right now.

562
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:26,723
- In my bag.

563
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:27,556
- Thanks.

- Looking at that blue speck

590
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:32,850
is like seeing the
beginning of the universe,

591
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:37,290
a faint glimpse into
your past, ancient light.

592
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,919
- I always thought the universe
was just black and white.

593
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:41,693
- [Young Dogstar] What star is that?

594
00:35:41,693 --> 00:35:45,054
- The same star-
- Great Orion Nebula

595
00:35:45,054 --> 00:35:47,054
is fuzzy and huey green.

596
00:35:48,631 --> 00:35:52,631
Antares, the Red Giant,
is actually pale orange.

597
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,863
Vega's white with a bluish cast.

598
00:35:56,863 --> 00:36:01,113
And little Albireo, the
star at the beak of Cygnus,

599
00:36:02,712 --> 00:36:06,462
the Swan, a binary star,
with a star partner.

600
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,573
- Star partners, how beautiful.

601
00:36:14,348 --> 00:36:19,348
Together forever, orbiting
around, and 'round, and 'round.

602
00:36:19,712 --> 00:36:22,559
Where'd they all come from?

603
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,038
Where's Dog Star?

604
00:36:24,038 --> 00:36:26,833
- [Voice Of Marcus] The
shiniest brightest star.

605
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:30,128
- To the diagonal left of Orion.

606
00:36:30,128 --> 00:36:31,545
- It's twinkling.

607
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,540
Here, you look.

608
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:39,601
(Gabrielle groans)

609
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:43,101
- Sirius, the Dog Star, has a star partner

610
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:49,922
orbiting with it.
- Perfect.

611
00:36:49,922 --> 00:36:53,428
Sirius, perfect.
- A star partner?

612
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:55,261
- Sirius B.
- Sirius B.

613
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,168
- Are you cold?

614
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:02,918
- I need to lie down, sleep more.

615
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:13,261
(Gabrielle groans)

616
00:37:17,311 --> 00:37:19,978
- Hmm, you don't look very well.

617
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:26,859
Where's your little star gone?

618
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:29,497
- I lost it.

619
00:37:33,271 --> 00:37:34,271
- It's gone.

620
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:37,826
(knocking at door)

621
00:37:37,826 --> 00:37:39,761
- [Astro] Is Gabrielle in there?

622
00:37:39,761 --> 00:37:40,594
- What was that?

623
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:42,407
(knocking at door continues)

624
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:44,075
(Dogstar groans)

625
00:37:44,075 --> 00:37:44,908
- Chaos.

626
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:01,181
(door clatters)

627
00:38:01,181 --> 00:38:02,473
Why are you here?

628
00:38:02,473 --> 00:38:03,667
- Me?

629
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,935
I'm just checking
everything's all right, okay?

630
00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:07,027
- Everything's fine, all right?

631
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:07,860
It's beautiful.

632
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,738
Bellissimo, thank you for asking.

633
00:38:09,738 --> 00:38:11,315
How 'bout you?

634
00:38:11,315 --> 00:38:12,930
- Me?

635
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,763
All right, here it is.

636
00:38:13,763 --> 00:38:14,721
I'm a bit strapped for cash.

637
00:38:14,721 --> 00:38:16,221
What have you got?

638
00:38:20,224 --> 00:38:22,830
Then I'll take that as a no.

639
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,038
- Can't Cassy help you?

640
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:25,182
- Cassy?

641
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:26,327
Hmm, maybe.

642
00:38:26,327 --> 00:38:27,513
(tapping)

643
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,928
Maybe, maybe Gabrielle's got something.

644
00:38:29,928 --> 00:38:32,291
- She's sleeping.
- Should we have a look?

645
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:34,055
All right, where's Beth?

646
00:38:34,055 --> 00:38:36,145
- Beth, she's gone away.

647
00:38:36,145 --> 00:38:37,057
She's away.

648
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:38,317
- Gone where?

649
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:39,150
- I don't know.

650
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,238
I don't ask any questions, all right?

651
00:38:40,238 --> 00:38:41,792
I stay in my room.

652
00:38:41,792 --> 00:38:45,427
- Beth's gone, no money, this,
this is fucking great, mate.

653
00:38:45,427 --> 00:38:47,387
This is great.

654
00:38:47,387 --> 00:38:49,660
- Well, what do you expect?
- For god's sake.

655
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,860
(door clatters)

656
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,693
(door thuds shut)

657
00:38:53,693 --> 00:38:55,088
- I have to go.

658
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:55,921
I'm going.

659
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:01,869
- Maybe you should stay?

660
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:03,952
You don't look very well.

661
00:39:06,072 --> 00:39:07,767
- I can't stay.

662
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:08,850
I need to go.

663
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:28,818
- [Voice Of Gabrielle] Star partner.

664
00:39:28,818 --> 00:39:30,401

- Perfect.

665
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:35,958

666

668
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:53,789
Where's your little star gone?

669
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:56,496

00:44:38,654 --> 00:44:41,573
- Look, I really need to borrow some cash.

728
00:44:41,573 --> 00:44:43,882
- Mom stopped giving me
pocket money years ago.

729
00:44:43,882 --> 00:44:44,721
- Oh, yeah?

730
00:44:44,721 --> 00:44:46,162
Look, I wouldn't ask, you know that,

731
00:44:46,162 --> 00:44:47,463
unless I really had to,

732
00:44:47,463 --> 00:44:48,494
but, you know, mom's out,

733
00:44:48,494 --> 00:44:50,435
and you're a good guy,
and everything like that,

734
00:44:50,435 --> 00:44:52,544
and if I could just have
a little bit of cash,

735
00:44:52,544 --> 00:44:54,461
or something like that?

736
00:44:58,632 --> 00:45:01,059
Do you use this old thing anymore?

737
00:45:01,059 --> 00:45:03,998
- Well, I don't look through it.

738
00:45:03,998 --> 00:45:05,342
- [Arnold] It's been
here a while, isn't it?

739
00:45:05,342 --> 00:45:07,225
Gatherin' dust, doing nothing.

740
00:45:07,225 --> 00:45:10,635
- It was a gift from dad.
- Can I borrow it for a while?

741
00:45:10,635 --> 00:45:12,954
There's a comet coming, you know?

742
00:45:12,954 --> 00:45:15,457
- And what are you gonna
do, go looking for a comet?

743
00:45:15,457 --> 00:45:17,207
- No, I'll be honest with you, brother.

744
00:45:17,207 --> 00:45:18,764
I'm gonna take that and
get some money on it,

745
00:45:18,764 --> 00:45:20,179
just until mom gets back.

746
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:22,387
Now, when she returns,
I'll have it back for ya.

747
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:23,961
I mean, let's be honest, you don't use it.

748
00:45:23,961 --> 00:45:25,806
It probably doesn't work right anyway.

749
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,003
You won't miss it.

750
00:45:28,003 --> 00:45:29,753
- Are you in trouble?

751
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:31,773
- Trouble?

752
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:32,606
Not me.

753
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:34,251
- Get your filthy hands off it.

754
00:45:34,251 --> 00:45:35,939
(jewelry box clicks)
- Fascinating.

755
00:45:35,939 --> 00:45:37,816
Is that for your new
girlfriend, by any chance?

756
00:45:37,816 --> 00:45:38,939
- Right, it's for Gabrielle.

757
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:39,772
She lost the other one.

758
00:45:39,772 --> 00:45:42,688
You can take the telescope.

759
00:45:42,688 --> 00:45:43,929
- Be warned, brother,

760
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:45,209
women are dangerous.

761
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,289
- If you want to touch my
head, you've gotta pay for it.

762
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:48,495
(Arnold exhales loudly)

763
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,912
- Have you seen her recently?

764
00:45:53,713 --> 00:45:55,583
(Dogstar sighs loudly)

765
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,333
- No, not in a while.

766
00:45:58,271 --> 00:46:00,101
- [Arnold] Well, she
can't have been your type,

767
00:46:00,101 --> 00:46:01,528
let's be honest.

768
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:02,611
- I feel sad.

769
00:46:05,252 --> 00:46:06,169
I miss her.

770
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:09,990
- Well, sink or swim, brother.

771
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,494
Sink or swim.

772
00:46:11,494 --> 00:46:14,411
(telescope clangs)

773
00:46:27,863 --> 00:46:30,696
(telescope thuds)

774
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:38,875
(tapping)

775
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,513
(door slams shut)

776
00:46:44,513 --> 00:46:45,779
- [Voice Of Dogstar] In the time it took

777
00:46:45,779 --> 00:46:49,182
for the teardrop to roll off his cheek,

778
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:51,897
the spinning Earth carried
him half a mile to the East,

779
00:46:51,897 --> 00:46:53,902
half a mile to the East.

780
00:46:53,902 --> 00:46:55,887
The motion of the Earth about the sun

781
00:46:55,887 --> 00:46:58,235
carried him back 40 miles westward.

782
00:46:58,235 --> 00:47:01,079
And the turning pinwheel of the galaxy

783
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:03,773
carried him 300 miles in a great circle

784
00:47:03,773 --> 00:47:06,126
about the galactic center.

785
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:07,836
And the drift of the solar system

786
00:47:07,836 --> 00:47:10,018
among the stars of the Milky Way

787
00:47:10,018 --> 00:47:13,178
bore him 20 miles towards the star Vega.

788
00:47:13,178 --> 00:47:17,011
(dramatic instrumental music)

789
00:47:19,527 --> 00:47:22,194
(rocks tinging)

790
00:47:32,675 --> 00:47:33,808
(door thuds shut)
- Everything's gone.

791
00:47:33,808 --> 00:47:35,024
Everything's gone.

792
00:47:35,024 --> 00:47:37,524
42 million, 140, think, 2,241.

793
00:47:39,238 --> 00:47:40,155
42,142,242.

794
00:47:42,934 --> 00:47:43,851
42,142,243.

795
00:47:48,582 --> 00:47:50,022
(both shivering)

796
00:47:50,022 --> 00:47:50,939
42,142,246.

797
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:56,724
42,142,247.

798
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,740
Are you cold?

799
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,155
Jump!

800
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:05,072
42,247,148.

801
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:09,244
Jump!

802
00:48:09,244 --> 00:48:12,221
42 million, 247 thousand...

803
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:13,116
Come to me.

804
00:48:13,116 --> 00:48:13,949
Come here!

805
00:48:13,949 --> 00:48:15,422
(Dogstar shivers)

806
00:48:15,422 --> 00:48:16,255
It's cold.

807
00:48:16,255 --> 00:48:18,088
142 million, 247, yes.

808
00:48:22,625 --> 00:48:23,792
- Where is it?

809
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:29,058
Where's the telescope, Dogstar?

810
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,270
- I gave it to Astro.

811
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,553
- Why?

812
00:48:36,918 --> 00:48:38,835
- Because he needed it.

813
00:48:40,304 --> 00:48:42,637
- What would he need it for?

814
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:46,099
- He wanted it.

815
00:48:47,044 --> 00:48:49,461
- But there's a comet coming,

816
00:48:50,613 --> 00:48:53,670
and I wanted to look at it with you,

817
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,547
and see the comet together.

818
00:48:56,547 --> 00:48:57,547
- It's okay.

819
00:48:58,426 --> 00:48:59,259
It's okay.

820
00:49:00,485 --> 00:49:03,005
It's all still there.
(Gabrielle sniffles)

821
00:49:03,005 --> 00:49:04,755
It's all still there.

822
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:08,364
Why did you come?

823
00:49:10,644 --> 00:49:14,061
- 'Cause I wanted to, more than anything.

824
00:49:15,405 --> 00:49:18,405
(melancholic music)

825
00:49:20,108 --> 00:49:20,941
(Gabrielle sniffles)

826
00:49:20,941 --> 00:49:22,393
- I have something for you.

827
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:26,226
(melancholic music continues)

828
00:49:33,778 --> 00:49:35,528
(Gabrielle sniffles)

829
00:49:35,528 --> 00:49:38,689
(jewelry box creaks)

830
00:49:38,689 --> 00:49:42,356
(gentle instrumental music)

831
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:45,709
- You went out?

832
00:49:45,709 --> 00:49:50,709
(gentle instrumental music continues)

833
00:49:51,015 --> 00:49:52,098
You went out?

834
00:49:58,283 --> 00:50:01,366
You think there are people out there?

835
00:50:02,241 --> 00:50:06,991
I mean, there must be if the
universe is infinite, right?

836
00:50:09,263 --> 00:50:13,346
- Well, somewhere in the
center of the Milky Way,

837
00:50:14,925 --> 00:50:17,758
near Sagittarius, is eaten matter.

838
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:20,976
- I can't see it.

839
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:25,226
- No, but if you listen
carefully, you can hear it.

840
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:29,204
It is constant and faint.

841
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:32,927
Radio waves, microwaves.

842
00:50:35,607 --> 00:50:36,479
(Gabrielle laughs)

843
00:50:36,479 --> 00:50:37,562
X-ray static.

844
00:50:38,694 --> 00:50:42,763
The maelstrom even at
the center of Sagittarius

845
00:50:42,763 --> 00:50:47,430
is a whirlpool of omni present
density feeding on stars.

846
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:53,193
It is a fierce monster, devouring light.

847
00:50:55,508 --> 00:50:58,675
Imagine the weight of 100 million suns

848
00:51:00,344 --> 00:51:04,094
condensed into one dark
seed chewing on suns,

849
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:12,162
and swallowing cosmic light.

850
00:51:18,253 --> 00:51:21,601
- Yeah, people, you know,
they're like stars stuff too.

851
00:51:21,601 --> 00:51:24,741
They are these big Red Giants.

852
00:51:24,741 --> 00:51:28,562
You know, they're big, but
they're all hot gas inside,

853
00:51:28,562 --> 00:51:30,630
and then you meet some,

854
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:33,733
and they're really hot and
bright, but they're small,

855
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:35,610
and they seem like they're gonna burn out

856
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:36,734
really fast and short,

857
00:51:36,734 --> 00:51:41,082
and then others are just
like these lumps of rock,

858
00:51:41,082 --> 00:51:45,665
and then there are the big
black holes devouring light.

859
00:51:50,016 --> 00:51:52,589
Astro shouldn't have the telescope.

860
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:54,922
- Yeah, but he's my brother.

861
00:51:58,471 --> 00:51:59,721
Are you lonely?

862
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:03,834
- When I'm with you I
feel like I've come home,

863
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:07,084
you know, close, like it's meant to be.

864
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:10,772
- Yeah, but you seem unhappy.

865
00:52:10,772 --> 00:52:15,772
- Hmm, you know, some people
talk about eternal life,

866
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,653
but (chuckles) to me,
that seems like torture.

867
00:52:19,653 --> 00:52:22,403
I mean, who'd wanna live forever?

868
00:52:27,256 --> 00:52:28,767
(Gabrielle sniffles)

869
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:33,566
You promise I won't get
sucked into a black hole?

870
00:52:33,566 --> 00:52:36,483
(Gabrielle laughs)

871
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:39,781
- Can I draw you some more?

872
00:52:41,164 --> 00:52:43,331
- Mmm, I'm gonna lay down.

873
00:52:49,524 --> 00:52:52,721
(paper rustles)

874
00:52:52,721 --> 00:52:54,304
- Put your star in.

875
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:58,631
(jewelry box creaks)

876
00:53:08,795 --> 00:53:11,962
(upbeat mellow music)

877
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:16,762
- Dogstar?

878
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:22,293

890
00:54:01,507 --> 00:54:03,020

00:54:55,088 --> 00:54:56,797
(Gabrielle coughs)

906
00:54:56,797 --> 00:54:59,297
(zipper zips)

907
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:04,347
(car door clatters)
(door alarm dings)

908
00:55:04,347 --> 00:55:08,157
(Gabrielle coughs)
(car door slams shut)

909
00:55:08,157 --> 00:55:11,074
(car engine whirs)

910
00:55:13,814 --> 00:55:16,465
(gravel crunches)

911
00:55:16,465 --> 00:55:17,298
- Nicky?

912
00:55:18,162 --> 00:55:20,472
Nicky, she's not here.

913
00:55:20,472 --> 00:55:21,305
No.

914
00:55:22,574 --> 00:55:23,857
Look, I have waited, Nicky.

915
00:55:23,857 --> 00:55:25,327
I...

916
00:55:25,327 --> 00:55:26,160
Yes.

917
00:55:27,133 --> 00:55:28,133
Yes, I know.

918
00:55:28,982 --> 00:55:32,663
No, but she's not coming,
and I need her to come.

919
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,476
Nicky, you gotta help me.

920
00:55:34,476 --> 00:55:35,712
Nicky?

921
00:55:35,712 --> 00:55:36,871
Okay, I'll come home.

922
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:37,704
Bye.

923
00:55:37,704 --> 00:55:40,454
(phone clatters)

924
00:55:41,448 --> 00:55:42,698
- So Gabrielle?

925
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,523
You and Dogstar?

926
00:55:45,523 --> 00:55:46,938
What'd you do to him?

927
00:55:46,938 --> 00:55:48,516
Cast a spell on him?

928
00:55:48,516 --> 00:55:49,673
What'd you do to him?
(Gabrielle mumbles)

929
00:55:49,673 --> 00:55:51,239
All right.
- Nothing.

930
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:52,228
- Nothin'?

931
00:55:52,228 --> 00:55:55,939
How 'bout layin' some
of that nothin' on me?

932
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:58,022
Come on, what do you say?

933
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:02,046
Dogstar know about your
little secret, does he?

934
00:56:02,046 --> 00:56:05,713
(mellow instrumental music)

935
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:11,993
(knocking at window)

936
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,699
- Gabrielle?

937
00:56:13,699 --> 00:56:15,108
(knocking at window continues)

938
00:56:15,108 --> 00:56:17,469
Gabrielle, what the hell
are you doin' out here?

939
00:56:17,469 --> 00:56:18,919
Gabrielle?

940
00:56:18,919 --> 00:56:22,002
What the hell are you doin' out here?

941
00:56:24,186 --> 00:56:25,945
(car door clatters)

942
00:56:25,945 --> 00:56:28,213
Babe, you look like hell.

943
00:56:28,213 --> 00:56:29,430
Come on.

944
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:30,943
I'll take care of you.

945
00:56:30,943 --> 00:56:32,306
- I'm lost, Nicky.

946
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,176
- I know, babe.

947
00:56:33,176 --> 00:56:34,134
We're all lost.

948
00:56:34,134 --> 00:56:35,119
Come on.

949
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,452
Come with Nicky.

950
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,877
- Who's seen the comet?

951
00:56:44,877 --> 00:56:46,377
Have you, darling?

952
00:56:47,263 --> 00:56:50,763
- Comet hot, comet cold, comet in the sky,

953
00:56:51,818 --> 00:56:53,792
let the future be told.

954
00:56:53,792 --> 00:56:55,662
But I can't find it!

955
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,995
I can't find it!

956
00:56:58,076 --> 00:57:00,627
- Something seems definitely odd.

957
00:57:00,627 --> 00:57:02,695
- He really misses his dad.

958
00:57:02,695 --> 00:57:05,509
- Actually, it's girl trouble.

959
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:06,961
- How can that be?

960
00:57:06,961 --> 00:57:07,979
- Gabrielle dumped him.

961
00:57:07,979 --> 00:57:09,133
- What do you mean?

962
00:57:09,133 --> 00:57:11,353
- Well, I don't know how much
she was here, but she was,

963
00:57:11,353 --> 00:57:13,064
and now she's not.

964
00:57:13,064 --> 00:57:15,908
Dogstar fell for it,
and now he's mourning.

965
00:57:15,908 --> 00:57:18,177
- She seemed like such a sweet girl.

966
00:57:18,177 --> 00:57:19,010
- No, she wasn't.

967
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:19,868
She's a slut.

968
00:57:19,868 --> 00:57:20,951
- Cassiopeia.

969
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,127
- You shouldn't negate
a woman's sexual being.

970
00:57:24,127 --> 00:57:26,059
- Most definitely not.

971
00:57:26,059 --> 00:57:28,296
- But she is a slut.

972
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:30,858
- I thought she was your friend?

973
00:57:30,858 --> 00:57:31,691
- Was.

974
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:35,620
- Hmm.

975
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:39,453
(dramatic instrumental music)

976
00:58:22,642 --> 00:58:26,059
(intense dramatic music)

977
00:58:38,841 --> 00:58:40,781
- [Gabrielle] What's this worth?

978
00:58:40,781 --> 00:58:45,031
(intense dramatic music continues)

979
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:50,210
- [Beth] Cassy and Astro seem to feel

980
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:53,132
that you may be unhappy
because of Gabrielle.

981
00:58:53,132 --> 00:58:54,945
- That's because I miss her.

982
00:58:54,945 --> 00:58:57,067
- She's no good, honestly.

983
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:58,958
- No good for what, Astro?

984
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:01,225
- She's just no good for you.

985
00:59:01,225 --> 00:59:02,757
- Dog, you can't trust her.

986
00:59:02,757 --> 00:59:04,679
- Can't trust her, Cassy?

987
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:05,551
With what?

988
00:59:05,551 --> 00:59:06,884
What have I got?

989
00:59:07,828 --> 00:59:08,995
My reputation?

990
00:59:09,878 --> 00:59:13,617
(Dogstar sobs)
My low self-esteem?

991
00:59:13,617 --> 00:59:14,786
- [Cassy] We're just worried.

992
00:59:14,786 --> 00:59:16,539
We're concerned.

993
00:59:16,539 --> 00:59:18,230
- How dare you?

994
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:19,438
- She's no good.

995
00:59:19,438 --> 00:59:20,954
I feel very strongly about this.

996
00:59:20,954 --> 00:59:21,920
- You don't understand!

997
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,010
You know nothing!

998
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:24,186
- Now, that's not quite true.

999
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:26,424
I know a lot about that girl.

1000
00:59:26,424 --> 00:59:29,507
- Astro, do you know that I love her?

1001
00:59:38,468 --> 00:59:41,439
- Listen, mom's trying to say
something here, all right?

1002
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,687
She's trying to talk some sense into you.

1003
00:59:43,687 --> 00:59:45,021
- Leave me alone, Astro.
(Astro scoffs)

1004
00:59:45,021 --> 00:59:46,688
- I worry about you.

1005
00:59:52,443 --> 00:59:53,276
- Dogstar?

1006
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:58,804
(footsteps clomp)

1007
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,821
- [Astro] Well, well, well.

1008
01:00:02,821 --> 01:00:05,005
- Go away, Astro!

1009
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:06,588
You go away, Astro!

1010
01:00:08,176 --> 01:00:09,943
- [Astro] Ask her where
her lovely diamond is.

1011
01:00:09,943 --> 01:00:11,730
- You go away, Astro!

1012
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:13,287
You go away!

1013
01:00:13,287 --> 01:00:14,640
Go away, Astro!

1014
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,005
- You won't?

1015
01:00:16,005 --> 01:00:16,838
I will.

1016
01:00:16,838 --> 01:00:18,244
Tell him, Gabrielle.
- Leave her alone, Astro!

1017
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:19,198
- Tell him what you did with it.

1018
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,031
- Leave her alone, Astro!
- Tell me about that

1019
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:21,689
beautiful stone that he bought you.

1020
01:00:21,689 --> 01:00:23,286
- You leave her alone!

1021
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,119
- Look at him.

1022
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:25,942
My brother, who never leaves the house.

1023
01:00:25,942 --> 01:00:26,775
You know what?

1024
01:00:26,775 --> 01:00:28,577
Never leaves his fucking bedroom.,

1025
01:00:28,577 --> 01:00:29,983
went into town for you,

1026
01:00:29,983 --> 01:00:32,933
went on to town, and bought
that beautiful stone.

1027
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:34,037
And what'd you do with it?

1028
01:00:34,037 --> 01:00:35,759
- Leave her alone!
- I think maybe we know.

1029
01:00:35,759 --> 01:00:36,592
What'd she do with it?

1030
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:37,550
She sold it!

1031
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,309
For what, what'd she sell it for?

1032
01:00:39,309 --> 01:00:40,838
Her smack.
- Leave her alone!

1033
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:42,826
You didn't sell it.

1034
01:00:42,826 --> 01:00:44,718
You didn't sell it.
- I did, but not-

1035
01:00:44,718 --> 01:00:46,898
- [Astro] Keep away from
her, mate. She's small time.

1036
01:00:46,898 --> 01:00:48,463
- She didn't sell it.
- She's small time.

1037
01:00:48,463 --> 01:00:50,761
- You didn't sell it.

1038
01:00:50,761 --> 01:00:52,203
You didn't sell it.
- Yeah, she sold it.

1039
01:00:52,203 --> 01:00:53,892
- No, she didn't sell it!
- No-

1040
01:00:53,892 --> 01:00:54,725
Nothing but trouble.
- I did, but he was

1041
01:00:54,725 --> 01:00:55,644
gonna take-
- She did.

1042
01:00:55,644 --> 01:00:56,645
See?
- He didn't get it.

1043
01:00:56,645 --> 01:00:57,603
- She's admitting it.

1044
01:00:57,603 --> 01:00:58,951
- Leave her alone.
- You didn't sell it.

1045
01:00:58,951 --> 01:00:59,784
- Look at you.
- You didn't sell it.

1046
01:00:59,784 --> 01:01:01,150
- You're nothing but trouble, hey?

1047
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:03,070
You're nothing but trouble.

1048
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:04,454
- You sold it.
- You're no good.

1049
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:06,975
- Dogstar!
- You sold it.

1050
01:01:06,975 --> 01:01:07,808
- Dogstar!

1051
01:01:09,853 --> 01:01:11,104
- [Astro] Get out of here!

1052
01:01:11,104 --> 01:01:12,931
- Dogstar!
- I want you out.

1053
01:01:12,931 --> 01:01:14,348
- Dogstar!
- Yeah?

1054
01:01:15,262 --> 01:01:17,298
Feel pretty fucking bad, don't you?

1055
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,698
(Gabrielle wails)

1056
01:01:19,698 --> 01:01:23,059
(Gabrielle yells)
Out the fucking house.

1057
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:24,725
(car door slams shut)
(Gabrielle wails) Get out!

1058
01:01:24,725 --> 01:01:27,975
And you take your dirty habit with you!

01:01:34,176 --> 01:01:37,093

1092
01:03:41,131 --> 01:03:44,706

- [Voice Of Gabrielle] And
you promise I won't get

1100
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:14,799
sucked into a black hole?

1101
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:20,043
- No, I haven't been
in his room for years.

1102
01:04:21,142 --> 01:04:23,059
Please come right away.

1103
01:04:24,656 --> 01:04:26,239
All right, goodbye.

1104
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:31,679
(melancholic music)

1105
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:36,150
- You see, inside are
tiny pieces of glass,

1106
01:04:37,659 --> 01:04:39,582
and they bring the light from

1107
01:04:39,582 --> 01:04:43,878
thousands of light-years
away into your bedroom,

1108
01:04:43,878 --> 01:04:47,953
straight into your eye,
and into your head.

1109
01:04:47,953 --> 01:04:51,203
The Egyptians saw wheat spread by Isis.

1110
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,963
For the Eskimos, the fall of snow.

1111
01:04:59,158 --> 01:05:01,408
Bushmen saw campfire ashes.

1112
01:05:04,095 --> 01:05:05,626
(knocking at door)

1113
01:05:05,626 --> 01:05:06,698
And the Arabs, a river.

1114
01:05:06,698 --> 01:05:08,194
- Hey, Dogstar?

1115
01:05:08,194 --> 01:05:09,277
It's me, dad.

1116
01:05:10,621 --> 01:05:13,389
I'd like to talk to you.

1117
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:16,056
(door clatters)

1118
01:05:18,178 --> 01:05:20,269
(door slams shut)

1119
01:05:20,269 --> 01:05:22,686
(Beth sighs)

1120
01:05:26,686 --> 01:05:28,312
Did you see the comet?

1121
01:05:28,312 --> 01:05:29,289
(Dogstar sniffs loudly)

1122
01:05:29,289 --> 01:05:30,122
- No.

1123
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,347
- My god, what a beauty she was.

1124
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,767
A golden trail of light.

1125
01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:45,786
I saw her makin' her way
through the night sky,

1126
01:05:49,891 --> 01:05:52,641
on a journey across the universe.

1127
01:05:53,755 --> 01:05:57,088
(Dogstar sniffs loudly)

1128
01:05:59,014 --> 01:06:00,924
(Dogstar exhales loudly)
Alone and bright,

1129
01:06:00,924 --> 01:06:03,174
what a sight, what a sight.

1130
01:06:05,563 --> 01:06:08,896
(Dogstar sniffs loudly)

1131
01:06:11,288 --> 01:06:15,545
(melancholic music)
- I can't find her.

1132
01:06:15,545 --> 01:06:16,962
I can't find her.

1133
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:23,010
- We'll find her.
(Dogstar sniffs loudly)

1134
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:25,181
We'll find her Dogstar.

1135
01:06:25,181 --> 01:06:26,649
We'll find her.

1136
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:30,482
(melancholic music continues)

1137
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:35,930
(Dogstar sobs and sniffs)

1138
01:06:43,097 --> 01:06:46,312
Hey.
(dishes clang)

1139
01:06:46,312 --> 01:06:48,882
- Thank you.
(smooches)

1140
01:06:48,882 --> 01:06:49,715
Baby.

1141
01:06:51,072 --> 01:06:52,207
(Beth groans)
- How are you, man?

1142
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:53,790
- I was so worried.

1143
01:06:55,217 --> 01:06:57,617
- Now, Star Shine.
- Hmm?

1144
01:06:57,617 --> 01:06:58,712
- We're goin' out.

1145
01:06:58,712 --> 01:07:00,067
- You're going out?

1146
01:07:00,067 --> 01:07:01,183
Dogstar?

1147
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,201
- Dad's taking me to see Gabrielle.

1148
01:07:03,201 --> 01:07:05,180
- Wait, you two are gonna find her?

1149
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:06,255
How are you gonna help him?

1150
01:07:06,255 --> 01:07:08,500
Dividing rods, crystals?

1151
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,161
No one knows this town better me.

1152
01:07:10,161 --> 01:07:12,155
If anyone should help him, I should.

1153
01:07:12,155 --> 01:07:14,572
- This is between me and dad.

1154
01:07:15,441 --> 01:07:18,284
- No, this is between you and me.

1155
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,670
- Marcus?
- Dad promised me.

1156
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,869
- Listen, no disrespect, but dad,

1157
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:24,700
dad has trouble finding
his way around the kitchen.

1158
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,788
- Astro.
- You know it's true.

1159
01:07:26,788 --> 01:07:27,765
Where is he gonna go?

1160
01:07:27,765 --> 01:07:29,005
Where is he gonna look?

1161
01:07:29,005 --> 01:07:29,838
- Astro.

1162
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:30,893
- Dad?
- It's true!

1163
01:07:30,893 --> 01:07:31,810
- Tell him.

1164
01:07:37,649 --> 01:07:40,399
- Dogstar, this your journey now.

1165
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:45,385
You should go with your brother.

1166
01:07:45,385 --> 01:07:47,449
- Dogstar, I've got one question.

1167
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:50,199
Do you wanna find her, yes or no?

1168
01:07:52,256 --> 01:07:53,089
Yes or no?

1169
01:08:08,995 --> 01:08:09,828
We're off.

1170
01:08:11,082 --> 01:08:13,016
(glass clanks)

1171
01:08:13,016 --> 01:08:14,589
Listen, I need to borrow some money,

1172
01:08:14,589 --> 01:08:15,744
but it's just to borrow.

1173
01:08:15,744 --> 01:08:16,621
- Sure.

1174
01:08:16,621 --> 01:08:17,508
Here.

1175
01:08:17,508 --> 01:08:18,454
(Astro mumbles)
The keys.

1176
01:08:18,454 --> 01:08:20,121
- All right, thanks.

1177
01:08:28,781 --> 01:08:32,316
(footsteps ascending)

1178
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:35,316
(car door clatters)

1179
01:08:36,163 --> 01:08:41,163
March, 1999, Agent Astro
enters porn shop with caution.

1180
01:08:41,527 --> 01:08:44,034
While prying an answer out
of the half-witted owner,

1181
01:08:44,034 --> 01:08:47,771
his brother, Dogstar, keeps a
vigilant eye over the street.

1182
01:08:47,771 --> 01:08:49,098
I have information.

1183
01:08:49,098 --> 01:08:50,610
- Just tell me what he said.

1184
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:51,965
- Actually, bugger all,

1185
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:53,316
but I know where we're gonna go next.

1186
01:08:53,316 --> 01:08:54,170
- Where?

1187
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:55,943
- Nicky Peterson.

1188
01:08:55,943 --> 01:08:58,222
- I think she mentioned Nicky Peterson.

1189
01:08:58,222 --> 01:09:00,983
- Well, we find Nicky, we find Gabrielle.

1190
01:09:00,983 --> 01:09:02,411
- Well, how do we find her?

1191
01:09:02,411 --> 01:09:04,762
- Aren't you glad I'm here?

1192
01:09:04,762 --> 01:09:05,595
(Dogstar exhales loudly)

1193
01:09:05,595 --> 01:09:07,796
- Why do you want to help me?

1194
01:09:07,796 --> 01:09:11,213
- Because brother, you're my brother.

1195
01:09:11,213 --> 01:09:12,745
(car engine whirs)

1196
01:09:12,745 --> 01:09:13,578
Let's go.

1197
01:09:20,567 --> 01:09:22,900
- Let me show you something.

1198
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:25,470
- What?
- Come on.

1199
01:09:32,957 --> 01:09:36,624
(mellow instrumental music)

1200
01:10:45,018 --> 01:10:48,101
(footsteps clomping)

1201
01:10:53,303 --> 01:10:55,026
(object thuds)

1202
01:10:55,026 --> 01:10:55,992
(Dogstar claps)

1203
01:10:55,992 --> 01:10:59,164
(knocking at door)

1204
01:10:59,164 --> 01:10:59,997
- You must be Nicky?

1205
01:10:59,997 --> 01:11:02,164
I'm looking for Gabrielle.

1206
01:11:03,451 --> 01:11:04,284
- Who are you?

1207
01:11:04,284 --> 01:11:05,117
- I'm Astro.

1208
01:11:05,117 --> 01:11:06,885
I'm here with my brother, Dogstar.

1209
01:11:06,885 --> 01:11:07,718
Dogstar?

1210
01:11:12,145 --> 01:11:13,724
Dogstar?

1211
01:11:13,724 --> 01:11:15,307
- Ah, man, Dogstar.

1212
01:11:17,721 --> 01:11:21,108
Gabrielle, my lovely Gabrielle,

1213
01:11:21,108 --> 01:11:22,708
just wanted to be happy, you know?

1214
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:23,541
She...

1215
01:11:24,642 --> 01:11:26,029
When something like this happens,

1216
01:11:26,029 --> 01:11:28,112
you either-
- Is she here?

1217
01:11:29,106 --> 01:11:31,699
- She's gone, man, you know?

1218
01:11:31,699 --> 01:11:34,764
- No, I don't know what you
mean. What on earth do you mean?

1219
01:11:34,764 --> 01:11:37,681
- She overdid it, choked, you know?

1220
01:11:41,558 --> 01:11:42,391
I found her.

1221
01:11:42,391 --> 01:11:43,960
She didn't know what she was doing.

1222
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,293
She was so sick.

1223
01:11:47,061 --> 01:11:50,002
- Never ever tell him how you found her.

1224
01:11:50,002 --> 01:11:53,436
- I knew I shouldn't have
left her there, you know?

1225
01:11:53,436 --> 01:11:56,625
- [Astro] When did you find her?

1226
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:57,739
- It was like last week.

1227
01:11:57,739 --> 01:11:59,322
It was on a Sunday.

1228
01:12:00,293 --> 01:12:01,215
No, Monday.

1229
01:12:01,215 --> 01:12:02,882
Yeah, it was Monday.

1230
01:12:04,501 --> 01:12:05,445
- [Astro] This isn't right, Dog.

1231
01:12:05,445 --> 01:12:06,287
This isn't right.

1232
01:12:06,287 --> 01:12:07,602
- No, it's her car.

1233
01:12:07,602 --> 01:12:08,685
It's her car!

1234
01:12:09,603 --> 01:12:10,572
- Oh, well, he's gotta come in,

1235
01:12:10,572 --> 01:12:13,091
'cause she had something
she wanted to give him,

1236
01:12:13,091 --> 01:12:15,758
but I just didn't get to it yet.

1237
01:12:21,044 --> 01:12:21,877
- Sorry.

1238
01:12:31,099 --> 01:12:32,766
- Where's Gabrielle?

1239
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:36,075
Where's Gabrielle?

1240
01:12:36,075 --> 01:12:37,955
- She said she felt like
she always knew you.

1241
01:12:37,955 --> 01:12:41,651
She pawned her diamond for the telescope,

1242
01:12:41,651 --> 01:12:44,846
and she wanted to bring it to you.

1243
01:12:44,846 --> 01:12:46,096
- Where is she?

1244
01:12:49,747 --> 01:12:50,830
- She's gone.

1245
01:12:52,562 --> 01:12:54,326
- When is she coming back?

1246
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:56,826
- No, she's gone away forever.

1247
01:12:58,233 --> 01:13:00,490
- Where's she gone?

1248
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:03,411
(Astro sighs loudly)

1249
01:13:03,411 --> 01:13:05,689
- To make a new start.

1250
01:13:05,689 --> 01:13:06,772
I don't know.

1251
01:13:19,948 --> 01:13:21,698
- She was in my arms,

1252
01:13:25,313 --> 01:13:26,730
and I let her go.

1253
01:13:27,835 --> 01:13:28,835
- I'm sorry.

1254
01:13:35,899 --> 01:13:37,979
(Dogstar sniffs loudly)

1255
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:39,817
- It's all just...

1256
01:13:39,817 --> 01:13:41,569
It's all just absurd!

1257
01:13:41,569 --> 01:13:42,902
It's all absurd!

1258
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:50,844
Oh, that's your word, Astro.

1259
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:55,923
Well, now I know what you mean.

1260
01:13:56,897 --> 01:13:58,980
