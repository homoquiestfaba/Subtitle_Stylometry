00:45:12,056 --> 00:45:15,753
(man #3) Excuse me.
would you mind just clueing us in a bit?

281
00:45:15,826 --> 00:45:18,056
Could you let us know what's going on?

282
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:22,429
Yeah. we were just saying that this one
fits well. That this fits well.

283
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:29,696
- How's that?
- Good.

284
00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:38,107
We're just gonna shorten the straps a bit.

285
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:55,531
We can add a strap around the waist
between these two straps here.

286
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,090
(man #3) Excuse me. is that necessary?

287
00:46:01,572 --> 00:46:04,507
It's up to her.
Would you like a strap around the waist?

288
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:06,634
No. no. it's OK.

289
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:14,049
Can you just walk back and forth?

290
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:20,856
Yeah. That looks quite natural.

291
00:46:20,925 --> 00:46:24,383
She's pretty.
That's good. Walk a bit more.

292
00:46:27,932 --> 00:46:33,598
If you shift your weight a little bit forward.
it will help with your lower back.

293
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:39,632
And you can also hook your hands up
underneath here.

294
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,507
Good.

295
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:48,182
- How's it feel? Is it too heavy?
- No. it's OK.

296
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:53,785
It's about 30 pounds.
but most of the weight is in the nails.

297
00:46:53,858 --> 00:46:58,295
- We can take some out if you like.
- No. you can put more in if you want.

298
00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:14,334
(unzips bag)

299
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:22,709
(zips bag)

300
00:47:47,845 --> 00:47:51,212
These don't work.
so you can wear them around your neck.

301
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:03,087
It's very easy.
This switch locks it.

302
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,096
And you just flip it to unlock it
and press this button.

303
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:12,295
- OK. It's this button here?
- That button. The other buttons don't work.

304
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:15,202
You just flip it to unlock it
and press this button.

305
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:18,400
Go ahead. try it.
It's not connected now.

306
00:48:20,878 --> 00:48:22,641
Try it a few more times.

307
00:48:32,156 --> 00:48:34,681
One more time before we connect it.

308
00:48:53,344 --> 00:48:56,370
