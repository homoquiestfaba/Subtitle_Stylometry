00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:11,277
'Twasthe first day of December

2
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:14,047
when all through the house

3
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,949
not a creature was stirring,

4
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,251
not even Santa's spouse...

5
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,423
What are you doing?

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,891
What time is it?

7
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:26,459
It's December.

8
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,497
Christmas is in 25 days.

9
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:31,664
I'm looking for my hat!

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,201
Humbug!

11
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:40,173
Grinch.

12
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,845
The children were woken

13
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,081
with care by their pa...

14
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,382
Up, up, up, up, up, up!

15
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:53,052
Wake up! Ha!

16
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,697
Now, are you ready forsome
Christmas decorating?

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,622
Yes.

18
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,890
"Yes," who?

19
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,991
Yes, Santa.

20
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,091
Santa who?

21
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,326
Santa, sir!

22
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,327
That's more like it!

23
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,638
Now, where is private elf Susie?

24
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,631
Probably still sleeping, Santa, sir.

25
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,371
Well, let's go wake upthat lazy elf, huh?

26
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,335
Wake up, Susie! Christmas is coming!

27
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,638
Hoo! Haa!

28
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,872
And they greeted the day

29
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,141
with a wide-eyed awe...

30
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,509
Go away!

31
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,944
The Christmas treasures

32
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,379
were removedfrom safekeeping.

33
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,614
All right, catch this.

34
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:23,893
You were supposedto catch that.

35
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,651
No, you were!

36
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,652
No, you were...

37
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,653
Hey, hey, hey!

38
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,555
Peace on earth, huh?

39
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,295
The pride of the household

40
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,430
was the huge Christmas tree

41
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,199
which they decorated fully

42
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,134
for the neighbors to see.

43
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,268
Not straight.

44
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,638
Yes, it is.

45
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:46,606
It's falling over.

46
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:47,874
She's right.

47
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:49,418
You say that every year,
and every year, it doesn't.

48
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,677
Where are you going?

49
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,857
I'm going to get the string

50
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,756
so I can tie up the treeso
it doesn't fall over,

51
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,548
like I do every year.

52
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,450
She does not do thatevery year,

53
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,152
does she?

54
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,687
I do itevery year!

55
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,055
It's straight.

56
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,256
Look at that...

57
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:05,692
The exterior was always

58
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,660
such a glorious sight,

59
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,531
with a rainbow of colorsto
light up the night.

60
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:14,501
Tim!

61
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:15,702
Oh!

62
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,270
Uh, sorry, Dad.

63
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,608
The door was adorned

64
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,343
with a wreath made by mother.

65
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:28,581
Its handmade beautyfar exceeded all others.

66
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,421
Great, huh?

67
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,322
Okay, let's go.

68
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,724
That's a boy...

69
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,392
All right, how abouta blue one now?

70
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,727
Would you likea cookie?

71
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,728
I made themfrom scratch.

72
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,729
Yeah!

73
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,731
Pa and Tim assisted

74
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,199
the kind widow next door...

75
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,500
Thank you, Mrs. McKane.

76
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,811
And you take theseto your mother.

77
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,303
I'm sureshe'd like some.

78
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,538
What do you say?

79
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,639
Oh. Thank you.

80
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:53,640
You're welcome.

81
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,108
Thanks.

82
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,342
She rewarded them both

83
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,679
with Christmas goodiesgalore...

84
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,392
Are you ready?

85
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,227
Go for it, Dad.

86
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,628
All right, five...

87
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:16,763
four...

88
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,764
Three...

89
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,765
Two...

90
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,266
One...

91
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,401
Blast off!

92
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,770
I think we actually

93
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,205
have a chance of winning

94
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,815
the mayor's Christmasdecoration contest

95
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,839
this year.

96
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,243
Well, you know, we came close last year.

97
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,377
We came 41st, Mom.

98
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,555
Well, that was40 places better

99
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,822
than we didtwo years before that.

100
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,616
We've just got to improvethe
exact same amount,

101
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,276
and then we're goingto win that $5,000.

102
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,252
Oh, wedon't need

103
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,552
to win the mayor'scompetition.

104
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,864
We just need the houseto look pretty

105
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,789
for Christmas.

106
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,257
Well, I thinkwe're going to be

107
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,477
the best houseon the street.

108
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,494
The neighbors next door

109
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,630
liked modest decoration,

110
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,966
whilst those up the street

111
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,901
preferredcreature illumination...

112
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,304
Oh, hey, merry Christmas.

113
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,404
Merry Christmas.

114
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,506
Merry Christmas.

115
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,407
Yeah.

116
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,909
Merry Christmas.

117
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,317
Merry Christmas!

118
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,620
Aren't the lights pretty?

119
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,822
It's too earlyfor Christmas lights.

120
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,790
It's hardly a weeksince Thanksgiving.

121
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,826
Well, I think they look nice.

122
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,566
So, did you writeyour letter to Santa?

123
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,734
Aw, Dad!

124
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:28,735
What?

125
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,370
How's he going to know what you want?

126
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,870
You mean, how are yougoing to know?

127
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,673
No, I mean Santa.

128
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,409
Mom and I havenothing to do with it.

129
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,710
Really.

130
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,078
The Wallaces' lights

131
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,446
were the best on the street

132
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:44,884
but to beat the whole
townwould be a great feat...

133
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,522
Mrs. Haynes, these framesare
in really bad shape.

134
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,624
Are you sure you don'twant to replace them?

135
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,760
Can you just repair them?

136
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,861
Sure, Mrs. Haynes,

137
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,496
I'll seewhat I can do,

138
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,698
but...

139
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,967
Let's see.

140
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:02,869
Ooh...

141
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,170
Hey, uh, Doris?

142
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,371
Mm-hm?

143
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,675
A sales rep leftthese
sample frames with us,

144
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,655
and I don't want to addany
more on to our line.

145
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,545
Can you throw these outfor me, please?

146
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,447
We're not carryingValentas anymore?

147
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,615
Yes, just, uh,

148
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,885
not this frame, hmm?

149
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,886
Oh.

150
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,120
Of course.

151
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,889
Okay, I'll, uh,

152
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:23,890
I'll toss them for you.

153
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,191
Thank you.

154
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,893
Just, um...

155
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,696
You know, Mrs. Haynes, it would be a shame

156
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,198
to throw out a perfectly
goodpair of frames.

157
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,776
I bet I could get your lenses to fit.

158
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Would you like them?

159
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,805
That sounds wonderful.

160
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,206
Merry Christmas.

161
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,709
But of beingbest in the street

162
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,912
Bob should not speak too soon,

163
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,148
for one house was not
yetfor Christmas festooned.

164
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,149
I love you.

165
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:51,617
I love you.

166
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,919
But it had been sold

167
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,822
so soon it would bestrewn with decorations

168
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,925
and great festivity.

169
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,903
Oh, look at this.

170
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,805
You're going to love it.

171
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Go pick out your room.

172
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,945
Hey, hey, Timmy!

173
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,823
Come on, we got two minutesto
get there, let's go!

174
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:21,948
Hope you didthe cat litter!

175
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:22,949
He'll do it later.

176
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:23,950
Hi, sweetie.

177
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,351
Do you know what?

178
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,219
The neighbors are moving
inacross the street.

179
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,620
We should say hi or something.

180
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,897
Great. Yeah. Maybewhen we get back.

181
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,757
Are we going to goChristmas
shopping tonight?

182
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,592
I can't.Susie's got basketball.

183
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,926
Well, how aboutafter dinner?

184
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,026
Yeah, maybe.

185
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,863
Okay. Come on, Timmy, let's go!

186
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,786
Hey, can you getthe other one?

187
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,711
Yeah.

188
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:52,712
Thanks, pal.

189
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,981
Bye, Susie!

190
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,215
Hey, Dad.

191
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,216
See you later.

192
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,851
Have a good game, Tim.

193
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,233
Hey, sweet pea.

194
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,068
He seems nice.

195
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,439
What?

196
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,943
Come on...

197
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,015
Oh, good evening.

198
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,550
It's still afternoon.

199
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,553
Well, whatever it is,
I hope you have a good one.

200
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,624

00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,133
How could they dosomething like that

211
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,992
when they onlyfirst moved in?

212
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,061
I don't think they
weretrying to show us up.

213
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,063
Well, it's notneighborly!

214
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,331
We had carolers first!

215
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,900
Did we not havecarolers, huh?

216
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,160
I think we hadcarolers first!

217
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,839
Maybe there could be

218
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,609
some kind of tragiccaroler accident, huh?

219
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,611
Maybe theirsprinkler system

220
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,045
could go off unexpectedly

221
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,847
and short them out.

222
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,427
We could put upsome more decorations.

223
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,526
Well, we gotta do something

224
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,451
if we're going to winthe competition.

225
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,452
It's not a competition.

226
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,553
Well, I mean...

227
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,164
You said we could bebest on the street.

228
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,389
What abouta Santa on the roof?

229
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:44,390
No.

230
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,490
Just a little one?

231
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:46,792
No.

232
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,755
Maybe just a few more lights.

233
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,532
Just... just enoughto give us the edge.

234
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:54,033
Yes!

235
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,869
All right, we'll be right back.

236
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,671
Okay...

237
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:02,475
Let's give it a try, huh?

238
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,111
It's magic time...

239
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,112
Hey-hey!

240
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,980
Awesome!

241
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,115
Amateurs!

242
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,784
Oh, hey, chocolate chip cookies!

243
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,884
My favorite.

244
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:13,952
Ah, ah, ah, ah,

245
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,021
they'refor the neighbors.

246
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,656
What neighbors?

247
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,124
The new neighbors.

248
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,127
Th-the new neighborswith
the singing carolers?

249
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,228
Yeah.

250
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,088
The new neighborswho
move in and immediately

251
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,831
try to show us upand make us look bad?

252
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:26,832
Those new neighbors?

253
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,601
They're new to our street.

254
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,745
We haven't even met them yet.

255
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,837
They're probablyreally nice.

256
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,639
Can you not see the carolers?

257
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,775

Besides, the extra lights,

265
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:48,687
they give you the edge.

266
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,089
Can you not see that?

267
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,626

278
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,398

279
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,590

Sure,

286
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,333
but, you know, we... we won't stay,

287
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:38,704

Well, that'sso sweet of you.

294
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,996
Mindy made thosefrom scratch.

295
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,588
Oh, and they look delicious.

296
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,224
So, I... I sawyou guys, uh,

They lookreally beautiful.

00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,396
Thank you.

300
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,040
Yes, we're just tryingto
make sure that Chip feels...

301
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,264
That's our son... feels at home.

302
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,233
You know what it's like.

303
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,234
I mean, it's a new home,

304
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,236
new school, that sort of thing.

305
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,237
Plus, of course, my husbandabsolutely loves

306
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,239
his Christmas decorations.

307
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,008
He says it's not
Christmasunless they're all up.

308
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:17,810
Just like Bob.

309
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,179
Oh, so that's your houseacross the street?

310
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,847

316
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:30,923
Stu!

317
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,134
Come and meet the neighbors!

318
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:33,726
And these are so lovely...

319
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,761
Look whatthey brought us, honey.

320
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,330
Oh...

321
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,133
Stu?

322
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,902
Bob?

323
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,403
Stu Jones?

324
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,939
Bob Wallace?

325
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,840
You twoknow each other?

326
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,275
This is...

327
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,276
Mindy, let's go.

328
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,744
What?

329
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,183
What in the worldwas that all about?

330
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,184
What just happened?

331
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,286
That man is evil!

332
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,790
He is a liar, and he is a cheat!

333
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,260
I can't believe he movedto Honeyview Lane,

334
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,895
and just beforeChristmas!

335
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,297
So, I take it you know Stu?

336
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,032
Oh, yeah, I know Stu.

337
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,801
I know Stu Jones all too well!

338
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,636
Go on.

339
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,076
We grew up together.

340
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,045
We were friends in high school.

341
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,246
Close friends?

342
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,848
Best friends.

343
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,182
We did everything together.

344
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,151
We were onthe football team together.

345
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,319
We did homeworktogether.

346
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,888
We were inEagle Scouts together.

347
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,325
We were even planning
ongoing to college together.

348
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,659
It was weird.

349
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,028
I mean, we... we would
finisheach other's sentences.

350
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,330
Like you were married?

351
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,332
More like we were twins.

352
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,968
I mean, sometimeswe didn't even talk.

353
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,336
I would show up at his house

354
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,904
to pick him up to go to school...

355
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,273
and find we were
wearingthe same clothes.

356
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,342
Sometimes we even
didexactly the same things

357
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,343
without telling each other.

358
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,345
So, what happened?

359
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,647
Well, the Christmas

360
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,182
before we graduated,

361
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,759
we were both delivery boysat the paper,

362
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,319
and they werehaving a contest.

363
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,054
Whoever soldthe most subscriptions

364
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,357
would win a bright red...

365
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,059
Honda motorcycle.

366
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,794
I mean, we were seniorsin high school.

367
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,339
To us, this wasthe coolest
thing in the world!

368
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,298
So, who won it?

369
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,966
Well, it's notthat simple.

370
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,301
We agreed we'd both go for it.

371
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,302
You know, may the best man win,

372
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,337
and everythingwas good and fine

373
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,437
until I found out

374
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:30,075
that Stu had beenselling subscriptions

375
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,178
to people in my delivery area!

376
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,146
Well, it wasn't likel
was going door-to-door

377
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,114
where he delivered the paper.

378
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,383
I sold all over town.

379
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,085
If they happened to livein
his area, then so be it.

380
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,222
I mean, it wasn't like I
wasasking for their address, or...

381
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,090
Didn't you need their address

382
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,468
in order to deliver their paper?

383
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,394
Yeah, but that was after

384
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,163
I'd already sold themthe subscription.

385
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:53,632
Anyway, I was upset.

386
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,334
We had a big fight,

387
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,434
I thought he was over it,

388
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,237
but instead...

389
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,408
I got a list of everyonethat
he delivered to,

390
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,111
and I called everyone

391
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,489
whose subscriptionwas about to expire,

392
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,415
and, uh...

393
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,983
I renewed their subscriptions.

394
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,251
Oh, no.

395
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,419
Oh, yeah.

396
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,354
He got credit for my customers.

397
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:17,423
Not full credit, mind you.

398
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,391
Renewals were only worthhalf a point.

399
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,428
So Stu finds out about
meselling to his customers,

400
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,429
and he goes nuts.

401
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,198
I mean, I couldn'tbelieve it!

402
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,268
What he did was so much
worsethan what I did.

403
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,512
I had to stealtwo of his customers

404
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,438
for every onethat he stole of mine.

405
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,306
Well, all's fairin love and war.

406
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,342
Not innewspaper motorcycle contests

407
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,943
between two best friends!

408
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,747
Sorry.

409
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,720
After that, our friendship was over.

410
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,756
We didn't speak to each
otherfor the rest of the year,

411
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,458
and then Bob...

412
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,827
went off to another college,

413
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,062
and we never saweach other again...

414
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,932
Till tonight.

415
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,400
So, who won, you or Stu?

416
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,868
It was a dead heat.

417
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,171
We came out equal.

418
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,173
Second.

419
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,475
So, who wonthe motorcycle?

420
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,809
Aw, who cares.

421
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:13,979
Some guy from the otherside
of the city, I think.

422
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,016
At least it wasn't Bob Wallace.

423
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,419
At least it wasn't Stu Jones.

424
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,187
Why did he have to move to Richmond?

425
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,889
We should neverhave left Shoreham!

426
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,224
I told you that!

427
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,226
He was going to be a dentist.

428
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,486
Maybe he thinks everybodyin
Richmond has rotten teeth!

429
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,528
A dentist,

430
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,931
what a racketthat is.

431
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,098
Check-ups everysix months?

432
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,335
You get your eyes checkedonce a year!

433
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,579
I mean, which would yourather lose, huh,

434
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,504
your teeth or your eyes?

435
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,240
Exactly!

436
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,107
We're going to have to move.

437
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,275
Sell the house!

438
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,077
No way!

439
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,388
You know, maybe this is your karma,

440
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:47,589
the universetrying to tell you

441
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,014
to stop being so stupid...

442
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,592
You know, if you guyswere
such close friends,

443
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,518
maybe it's trying to giveyour friendship

444
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,619
a second chance.

445
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:56,889
You're right.

446
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,757
That's exactly what it's doing.

447
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,026
Yeah.

448
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,362
It's giving us a second chance

449
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,298
to prove once and for all...

450
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,300
who is the winnerand who is the loser.

451
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,536
There will beno second place this time.

452
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,339
Just first placeand last place!

453
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,040
No motorcycle this time,

454
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,175
we are playing

455
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,510
for best decorated houseon the street!

456
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,280
Fate has smiled upon me today,

457
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,350
and I am ready to bring it on.

458
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,552
This means war.

459
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,025
Exactly where are you going?

460
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,660

497

Stu Jones, that's who!

498
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,500
He put a Santa Clauson his roof!

499
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,068
Well, you put a Santaon our roof.

500
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,202
Exactly!

501
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,646
Just because I put a Santa Clauson our roof

502
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,715
does not mean that he canput
a Santa Claus on his roof!

503
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,675
Well, it doesn't meanhe can't either.

504
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,711
He put upall eight reindeer.

505
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,679
We had Santa first!

506
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,348
Well, who's got more lights?

507
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,716
I don't know!

508
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,917
Well, you need to go count.

509
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,228
That's the only wayyou're going to know

510
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,253
who's winningthis thing.

511
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:15,353
That's a good idea.

512
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,722
Mm-hm.

513
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,424
Wait a minute.

514
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,393
I'm not going to countall the light bulbs.

515
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,694
Well, why not?

516
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,439
You're counting all the
Santasand all the reindeer.

517
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,398
Timmy!

518
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,568
Whose side are you on, anyway?!

519
00:20:56,655 --> 00:21:00,259
See, they've decoratedmost
of the obvious spots...

520
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,827
The roof line, trees,

521
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:05,263
some cheesy carolers.

522
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,798
Yeah, they still havethis yard area

523
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,134
and the driveway edgeto work with.

524
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,636
We, on the other hand,

525
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,104
have numerouspossibilities.

526
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,139
Give it a break, Stu.

527
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,841
Why?

528
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,609
Bob Wallace nevergave me a break.

529
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:18,709
He stolemy customers!

530
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,679
He's not a nice man, you mark my words!

531
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,947
His daughter seems okay.

532
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:24,616
You know his daughter?

533
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,151
I met her in the park.

534
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:29,321
Well, stay away from her.

535
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:33,225
His whole family are
probablyconniving cheats.

536
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,325
No.

537
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,411
Bob, we don't haveany more money

538
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,337
in the budgetfor decorations.

539
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,272
I'll usemy beer money.

540
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,372
Well, whatdo you think

541
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
is sittingin the fridge?

542
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,718
Well, then, I'll borrow something

543
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,210
from the Christmasparty fund.

544
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,211
You try that,

545
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:54,322
you'll bespending Christmas

546
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,181
with the birthday boyhimself.

547
00:21:56,281 --> 00:22:00,285
All right, well, consider
thismy Christmas present, okay?

548
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,892
Those wise menlook good.

549
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,661
Ah, they're onlytwo feet tall.

550
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,330
I want somethingbig, flashy.

551
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,433
Well, they light up.

552
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,902
Ah, I wantsomething that spins

553
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,336
or flies, you know?

554
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:22,808
Maybe like a laser light showkind of thing.

555
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,411
Don't churches havegood
Christmas decorations?

556
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,646
Church supply company,

557
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,549
that is a great idea.

558
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,395
Hey, hey, hey, wrong house.

559
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,691
Que?

560
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,559
Yeah, yeah.

561
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:41,793
That's the wrong house.

562
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,362
That's my orderthere, okay?

563
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,730
This doesn't goto this house.

564
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,531
This goesto that house, okay?

565
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:47,432
Everything... everything there.

566
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,434
Que?

567
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,368
No.Aqui.

568
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,770
No, no, no, noaqui.There.

569
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,870
Is there a problem?

570
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:53,805
Yeah, there'sa problem.

571
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:54,905
This is my order,

572
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:58,810
and I want it putover at my house.

573
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,512
The waybill saysthis house.

574
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:01,989
Well, I don't carewhat the waybill says.

575
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,949
I paid for it. It's my order.

576
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,917
I would like to take
itover to my house, okay?

577
00:23:06,017 --> 00:23:06,918
Hey, buddy!

578
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,687
- I paid for it!- Hey, hey, hey!

579
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,889
- It's my order, all
right?- That's my Joseph!

580
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,424
You're stealingmy Joseph!

581
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:13,425
Give me backmy Joseph!

582
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,426
It's my Joseph!

583
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,770
It's mine! Get your hands off it!

584
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:16,895
Stop it!

585
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,964
There's two orders,

586
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,566
two Josephs.

587
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,902
You both orderedthe same thing.

588
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,974
Then I don't want him. You can have him.

589
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,576
I don't want him either.

590
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:35,981
You can take my wholenativity scene back!

591
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,482
And mine too! Take it all away.

592
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,551
Credit me for what it cost.

593
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:41,586
Yes, you readthe order!

594
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:42,988
I know what it says!

595
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,723
Uh...

596
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:45,991
No returns?

597
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,592
Uh, excuse me, no refunds?

598
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,528
Refunds?

599
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:50,996
I... oh my!

600
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:51,997
So, when do you think

601
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,565
they're going toget over all this?

602
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,665
Who knows?

603
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,843
They haven't for25 years, apparently.

604
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:58,003
Well, it's not going to ruinmy Christmas.

605
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,971
Me either.

606
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:00,906
Welcome to the neighborhood.

607
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,741
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

608
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:03,708
You too.

609
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,809
Yeah.

610
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:27,999
They look pretty, don't they?

611
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,000
What?

612
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,869
The new nativity scenesthey've got.

613
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,108
They're exactly the same.

614
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,912
Do you reallynot like Christmas?

615
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:43,315
Who said I don'tlike Christmas?

616
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:45,584
Well, you're alwaysso gruff about it.

617
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,587
I just don't likeflashy Christmases.

618
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,789
I like Christmasthe way it used to be,

619
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:51,790
when it meantsomething,

620
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,024
with carols,

621
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,793
and the Christmas pageantat the church,

622
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,328
that kind of thing.

623
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,430
Well, the churchhas its pageant every year,

624
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,798
and the carol services.

625
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,800
I don't likefront lawns

626
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,768
that are so clutteredwith decorations

627
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,503
the grass can't grow,

628
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:07,572
and the lights on the housesare so bright,

629
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,807
it's like a football game.

630
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,042
I've got lights.

631
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,811
Y-yes,

632
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,614
but not a lot.

633
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,582
Come on, Lola.

634
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,518
It's timefor your dinner.

635
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,253
Good night.

636
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,354
Good night.

637
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:25,423
I think there'sa little Christmas romance

638
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,826
brewing on Honeyview Lane.

639
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,704
You know that old guywho's
been walking his dog

640
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,830
around herein the evenings?

641
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,431
Have you ever noticedthat Mrs. McKane

642
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,734
just happens to be outsidedoing something

643
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:36,902
every timehe walks by?

644
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,572
You're imagining things.

645
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,340
They're too old. She's got to be 80.

646
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,110
Only on the outside.

647
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,378
On the inside,

648
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:47,846
the woman is a girl of 18,

649
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,281
and every girl of 18

650
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,658
needs a little romancein her life.

651
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,583
Well, maybe,

652
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:53,184
but not withthat old Grinch.

653
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,185
I think he likes her,

654
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,354
and he's justtoo shy to say so.

655
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,870
Hey, did you seethis letter

656
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,459
Timmy wrote to Santa?

657
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,794
Yeah, "Dear Santa",

658
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,195
"I want a bike.

659
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,196
"Just a bike,

660
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:06,374
"a bike I'm nottoo big for.

661
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,265
"Only a bike,

662
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,376
"nothing elseexcept a bike,

663
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,477
"and if you can't get me that,

664
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,368
I'd really likea bike."

665
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:11,468
"A bike!" Yeah.

666
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:12,637
I was thinking,

667
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,872
we shouldget him a bike.

668
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:14,873
Yeah.

669
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,217
Yeah. Do you thinkwe can afford it?

670
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,876
If you stop buyingChristmas decorations

671
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,511
we don't need.

672
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,715
Do you think he actuallystill
believes in Santa?

673
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:28,219
Yeah, I think he does, a little bit.

674
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,363
Maybe we shouldget him the bike

675
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,431
and have Santa get himsomething else.

676
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,456
Yeah...

677
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,358
Hey, where's myChristmas party list?

678
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:36,027
I'm going to invite him.

679
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,562
Who?

680
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,340
The old guy that Mrs. McKanehas her eye on.

681
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:40,398
Oh.

682
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,842
I thought you were talkingabout Stu Jones.

683
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,468
Ah, thank you!

684
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,370
I'll talk to Mary tomorrow.

685
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,571
Over my dead body!

686
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,239
Do not tempt me.

687
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,474
They're our neighbors.

688
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,776
I will invite them, you will act nice.

689
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,512
That man is not setting footin my house!

690
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,890
If he's half as stubbornas
you are, my sweet,

691
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,650
he's not coming anyway.

692
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,355
Ta-da!

693
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:12,831
Hi.

694
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:13,698
Hi.

695
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,033
You've got your hoop up.

696
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,267
Yeah,

697
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,937
and, no, my dad put upthe
Christmas decorations.

698
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,573
It looks nice anyway.

699
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,478
You want to playsome one-on-one?

700
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,047
Uh, I've gota report due tomorrow.

701
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,882
Sorry.

702
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,585
It's okay.

703
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,526
So, uh,

704
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,428
what were you talking about

705
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,008
with that girlfrom across the street?

706
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:45,864
Susie?

707
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:46,798
Susie!

708
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,501
Susie, right...

709
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:53,405
Yeah, the, uh... enemy

710
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,240
from across the street.

711
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,074
We were just talking.

712
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:56,975
She said hi.

713
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,743
"She said hi."

714
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,980
Yeah, I'm sureit was just "hi,"

715
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,582
or was it,

716
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:07,986
"What other decorationsare
you planning to use?"

717
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,587
No.

718
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,790
That's becauseSusie's slick.

719
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,991
She's layingthe groundwork.

720
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:13,992
Don't you see?

721
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:14,826
Before you knowwhat's happened...

722
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,594
Boom!

723
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,463
You're spilling your guts, hmm?

724
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,563
Oh, for heaven's sake.

725
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,499
Please tell meyou are not suggesting

726
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,935
that Bob Wallace woulduse his daughter

727
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:24,803
to spy on you

728
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:25,804
and your stupid contest?

729
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,572
Yeah!

730
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:29,016
And don't eventhink about using Chip

731
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,642
that way either, Stu Jones.

732
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:31,943
Go.

733
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,111
I'm ashamed of you.

734
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:38,650
Hmm.

735
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:43,822
I can't believeyou want me to spy on them,

736
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:44,922
our own neighbors!

737
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,025
I'm not asking youto spy on anybody!

738
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,526
I'm saying,

739
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:49,770
if you're talkingwith the son,

740
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,005
and he happensto mention something

741
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,430
about their plans, you know, like,

742
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,934
"I just got back from
shoppingfor angels with my dad,"

743
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,036
or, "Sorry, I can't shoot hoop",

744
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:01,039
I'm helping my dadput
reindeer on the roof,"

745
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,907
you mightmention it to me.

746
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,809
What... hey!

747
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,278
Just a thought.

748
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,149
Pumpkin?

749
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,025
Stu, what's in the bags?

750
00:29:21,126 --> 00:29:23,061
Lights?

751
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,162
And decorations.

752
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,798
I'm going to doubleeverything we've got,

753
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,434
then I've reallygot him.

754
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,539
Bob?

755
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:36,007
I thought you promised Mindy

756
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,510
you weren't going to
buyany more decorations.

757
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,879
Uh, yeah, that... that's true, I did,

758
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,480
b-but I didn't buy these.

759
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,017
Uh, you know Bill Painterdown
at Bill's drug store?

760
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,419
I gave his whole familynew glasses.

761
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,089
So, I... I traded them.

762
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,573
Pfft.

763
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,243
What are you hiding?

764
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,078
Stu?

765
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:34,912
Hmm?

766
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,015
What are you doing?

767
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,316
He's got something.

768
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,227
He's hiding it in the garage,
but he's got something.

769
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,319
And how doyou know that?

770
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:44,188
Because I saw himback
his SUV up to the garage,

771
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:45,189
and lift something out of it.

772
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,324
He never backs up.

773
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,325
Why elsewould he do that

774
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,793
if he wasn'thiding something?

775
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,995
Maybe it's too heavy, and
he can't carry it far?

776
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,096
It could be anything.

777
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,032
I mean, does it notcross your sick mind

778
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,034
that maybeyour competition with him

779
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,069
is not be the only thinghe thinks about?

780
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,204
Mm.

781
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,345
Uh, doorbell, Stu.

782
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:08,846
Stu? Stu.

783
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:20,358
Oh, hello.

784
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,359
Sir.

785
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,327
I'm the fire marshal.

786
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,295
We gotan anonymous call

787
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,263
there may be somesafety concerns

788
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:26,431
at these premises.

789
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,142
I'm here to do an
electricalsafety inspection

790
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,534
to assure the safetyand well-being

791
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,437
of both your familyand your neighbors.

792
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,177
You got more thantwo decorative light cords

793
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,378
plugged together here.

794
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,213
AFC code 176 clearly states

795
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:45,616
not to plug more thantwo
light cords together,

796
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:48,953
and code 176 is plainly
labeledon this safety tag.

797
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:51,389
Well, I... I figuredif any problem occurred,

798
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,957
it'd throw my breaker,

799
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,158
so it didn't really...

800
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,993
Sir, the code is the code.

801
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,729
Yeah, I know...

802
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,499
The code is the code.

803
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,403
Those decorationshave to go, sir.

804
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,771
What?! Why?

805
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,749
Well, that limb does not
havethe structural integrity

806
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,408
to support those decorations.

807
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,276
If it were to break due to wind

808
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,312
or an accumulationof snow or ice,

809
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,489
it would cause extreme
tensionon those wires,

810
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:17,415
possibly causingan electrical shortage.

811
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:18,416
Snow or ice?

812
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,051
Come on, this is California.

813
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,086
It hasn't snowed here since,

814
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,387
well, the ice age.

815
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,808
It snowed in Malibutwo years ago,

816
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,390
and the weather forecastis calling for

817
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,491
below averagetemperatures

818
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,260
with a chance for showersthis Christmas.

819
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,261
There might even bea frost warning.

820
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,697
That's a bad mixfor that limb,

821
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,698
and those decorations.

822
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,932
Oh, come on...

823
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:37,435
And I've noticed lightsplugged
together in parallel

824
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:38,436
when they should be in sequence.

825
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,437
80 amps of power being drawn

826
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,439
on 40 ampextension cords?

827
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:43,241
The list goes on.

828
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,341
The bottom line is, sir...

829
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:45,919
Way too many lightsand not enough juice.

830
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:46,844
You've got to cut it downby half.

831
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:47,945
Oh, please, don't...

832
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:49,223
I'll expect this situationto be corrected

833
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,883
by the time I returnfor re-inspection.

834
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,217
When will that be?

835
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,385
Tomorrow.

836
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,096
By then I expectthis
situation to be corrected

837
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,356
and s-a-f-e, safe.

838
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,467
Yes...

839
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,872
Sometimesl amaze myself.

840
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,307
Why's that, Pumpkin?

841
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,577
Nothing.

842
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:23,281
Nothing.

843
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,184
I'm going to get the, uh...

844
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:29,921
Sir, I'm the fire marshal.

845
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,222
We've had an anonymous tip.

846
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,322
I'm here to perform

847
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,991
an electricalsafety inspection

848
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,235
to ensure the safetyand well-being

849
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,128
of both your familyand your neighbors.

850
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,372
If you just come outwith me, sir,

851
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:41,599
I'll show youa few infractions here.

852
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,882
A key...

853
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,427
Uh...

854
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,429
Hey...

855
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,232

00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,201
Oh, well... I'm, uh...

857
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,505
I'm just borrowing some
toolsthat I loaned to Bob.

858
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:28,606
You know.

859
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:29,607
That time of the season.

860
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,843
Puttin' updecorations...

861
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,246
Merry Christmas.

862
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,346
Oh!

863
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,615
Honey, I'll be right there.

865

Okay!

894
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,209
Where's the food?

895
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,789

My wife made it.

966
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:16,333
Only thing is, she makes it so dang hot,

967
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,769
and if... if I don't eat it,

968
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,171
no one will.

969
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:23,507
I'm going to getmore punch.

970
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,150
Mr. Jones?

971
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,652
Would you like some dip?

972
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:35,753
Uh, Mrs. Duncan made it,

973
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,254
and Mr. Duncan saysit's very good.

974
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,390
Yeah.

975
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:42,759
Would you like some...

976
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,531

977
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:48,899
Stu!

978
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,735
What? What?

979
00:42:51,835 --> 00:42:52,670
He tried to poison me.

980
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,371
Who?

981
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:55,482
Bob Wallace's son, that's who!

982
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,308
He tried to poison mewith that dip!

983
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,576
Oh, my goodness.

984
00:42:58,676 --> 00:42:59,543
Did you eat my dip?

985
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,345
It is extremely hot.

986
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:04,448
You know, I would loveto
tone it down a little,

987
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,317
but Walterloves it that way.

988
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,287
There, now, do you see?

989
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:11,898
It should comewith an FDA warning on it...

990
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:15,259
"hazardous to humans."

991
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,529
That is so rude.

992
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,665
That's good...

993
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,805
Okay, everybody.

994
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,206
Hello? Everybody?

995
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:31,308
Quiet!

996
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:33,410
Huh. Thank you, Walter.

997
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,712
It's the moment

998
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:35,892
you've allbeen waiting for.

999
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,283
It is time for "the Christmas game show..."

1000
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:45,522
with your host, Santy Claus!

1001
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,561
What is this?

1002
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,930
Well, every year, Bob puts on a game show.

1003
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,265
Don't worry, it's a lot of fun.

1004
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,301
Okay, Mindy, who's going to be Elfee?

1005
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:58,268
I don't know, Santa,

1006
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,670
do we haveany volunteers?

1007
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:03,407
Come on, somebody'sgot to be Elfee...

1008
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:04,675
Who's Elfee?

1009
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,511
Santa Claus' helper, the scorekeeper.

1010
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,912
I'll do it.

1011
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,347
You were Elfee last year.

1012
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:11,949
You can't do ittwo years in a row.

1013
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:13,626
Then I volunteerour new neighbor Stu Jones!

1014
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,586

1015
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,488
Please, I... I...

1016
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:18,956

1017
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:20,290
Aw, Santa,

1018
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,526

1020
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:24,795
Okay...

1021
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:26,397
Well, why don't you follow Mindy,

1022
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,831
and she willset you up.

1023
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,666
Elfee's alwayson the Donner team.

1024
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,036
What teamis Santa on?

1025
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,370
Santa's noton a team.

1026
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,514
No, he makes upthe questions,

1027
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:35,582
so that wouldn't be fair, right?

1028
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:36,907
Come on, let's go.

1029
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,610

1040
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,272

00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:14,711
Where's the key?

1042
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:15,713
Your dad must have it.

1043
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:16,847
He's in the living room.

1044
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,850
Need a hand?

1045
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:20,950
Dad...

1046
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:22,786
What are you wearing?

1047
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,688
Your father has agreed

1048
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:25,789

1049
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,257
in our littleChristmas game.

1050
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,460

Sure.

1054
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,667
One more...

1055
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:38,869
Okay, that's it.

1056
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:41,739
Let's not keepSanta waiting.

1057
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,574
Oh, ho!

1058
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:49,346
Okay...

1059
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,516
Elfee, your job

1060
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,485
is to screw in one of
these Christmas lights

1061
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,721
every time one of the
teamsgets an answer right.

1062
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,099
Do you think you can handle that?

1063
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:00,858
Don't worry about me.

1064
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:01,959
Okay.

1065
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,859
All right, we will
startwith the Donner team.

1066
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,829
Now, you're going topick a category.

1067
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,900
We have "Wassailing"or "Silent Night".

1068
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,369
Santa, we will take Wassailing.

1069
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,871
Wassailing, okay, and this category

1070
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,773
is about Christmas carols.

1071
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,008
So, "What was the gift"

1072
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,410
on the ninth day of Christmas?"

1073
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,446

1083
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,532
You are wrong.

1084
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,176
All right, Blitzen team, would
you like to try to answer?

1085
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,835
Yes, yes, yes.

1086
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,804
I believe it's "nine ladies dancing."

1087
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:48,505

One word.

1118
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,407

1119
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,042
Uh...

1120
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:01,511

My costume has nothingto do with the movie.

1127
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,025
As far as I know, there
were no elves in it.

1128
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,094
Santa, I don't thinkhe should be talking.

1129
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,095
Yes, she's right.

1130
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,830
Elfee, stop talking.

1131
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,799
Um... Okay.

1132
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,067

1140
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,150
Well, I'm sorry.

1141
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,818

1142
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:43,020

00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:50,520
Okay.

1298
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,089
Um, why don't you come byabout 2:00?

1299
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,591
Why don't we meetup the road?

1300
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:56,593
Just in case...

1301
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:58,533
You know, this whole
thingbetween our fathers.

1302
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,397
Yeah, good idea.

1303
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:02,265
Okay,

1304
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,200
I'll see you at 2:00.

1305
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,203
Well, good night.

1306
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,706
Good night.

1307
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:22,519
What the heck?

1308
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,320
You're Susie's littlebrother, aren't you?

1309
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:25,622
Who I am is a secret.

1310
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:26,990
All you need to know

1311
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,300
is that if we can'tmake a deal,

1312
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,093
I'm gonna tell your dadabout you and Susie.

1313
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:32,562
What kind of arrangement?

1314
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,662
What kind of decorations

1315
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:34,631
is your dad still planningto put out?

1316
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:35,565
I don't knowanything about that.

1317
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:36,566
Okay,

1318
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,534
then we'll just have to see

1319
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:38,635
what your daddy thinks

1320
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:40,335
about your late-night visitto our house.

1321
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,072
If he had something, I'd tell you...

1322
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,416
Not becauseyou're blackmailing me,

1323
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,440
you little doofus.

1324
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,408
I'd tell you

1325
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,585
because this wholething is stupid,

1326
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,478
and I'm fed up with it,

1327
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:51,347
but he doesn't have anything, not a thing.

1328
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:58,321
Nothing, huh?

1329
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,127
Perfect.

1330
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:11,501
Your mission, Stuart Jones,
should you decide to accept it,

1331
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:14,571
is to find outwhat Bob Wallace has hidden

1332
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:19,242
underneath that tarpin the garage.

1333
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:25,482
This is cool...

1334
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,317
I gotta take a picture.

1335
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:33,089
Smile and say cheese.

1336
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:35,458
Cheese.

1337
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,129
Oh!

1338
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,331
Ooh...

1339
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:47,403
Oh boy.

1340
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:49,506
I'll fix it tomorrow.

1341
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:57,814
Oh, yeah...

1342
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,352
Where are you going,

1343
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:03,820
and why are youdressed like that?

1344
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:10,693
I'm... Just doing a little...

1345
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:11,594
Research?

1346
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,530
Where?

1347
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:14,731
I'm just, uh,

1348
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,666
going to takea little peek

1349
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,368
in...

1350
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:21,504
Bob's garage.

1351
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,606
You are going to dono such thing.

1352
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:25,451
I've got to find outwhat
he's got hidden there!

1353
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:26,376
No, you don't.

1354
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,244
Yes, I do!

1355
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:29,612
Um...

1356
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,614
If you get arrested,

1357
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:35,318
don't you useyour phone call

1358
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:37,754
asking meto bail you out.

1359
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,456
Don't.

1360
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:41,724
I mean it.

1361
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:01,670
Aah!

1362
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,440
Bob!

1363
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,282
Did you bringKitty in?

1364
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,217
Hmm? Uh, Tim.

1365
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:15,661
Tim put her in the garagefor the party.

1366
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:16,586
No, no, no, he didn't,

1367
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:17,554
because the garage doorwas locked.

1368
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:18,554
You have to go get her.

1369
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,789
No, she'll be fine.

1370
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,658
She's going to get eatenby coyotes.

1371
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:24,360
I pity the coyote that tries.

1372
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,628
Go. You have to go...

1373
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:26,728
Ow!

1374
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:51,287
Hey! Kitty!

1375
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:52,387
Petal!

1376
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,325
Go, you dumb cat, go on!

1377
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:03,199
Great, now you're beating
upHelen's little tomcat.

1378
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,401
I'll never hearthe end of that.

1379
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,310
This is whyl'm not a cat person.

1380
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,748
Oh, my...

1381
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:31,494
Kitty! Petal!

1382
01:00:32,562 --> 01:00:34,497
Petal, I got dinner. Come here.

1383
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:37,934
Ah, there you are.

1384
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:40,370
Hey...

1385
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,504
Come here, hey.

1386
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:43,339
What does tonight's victimlook like, huh?

1387
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:47,610
You pleading the fifth?

1388
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,412
All right, you have got to stop

1389
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,614
bullying the dumband the defenseless.

1390
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:56,052
Yeah. Okay...

1391
01:01:05,028 --> 01:01:06,929
Here you go.

1392
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:13,736
Why can't you do thatwhen
you're outside all day?

1393
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:23,913
Hmm...

1394
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:43,565
Tomcat, is that you?

1395
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,802
Is that you, Tomcat?

1396
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:47,904
Go on home, go on,

1397
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:49,044
and no snitching to Helen,

1398
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,785
or I'll let Petal out againtomorrow night.

1399
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:39,989
Huh?

1400
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,691
A bike?

1401
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:55,938
So, what wasBob's big secret?

1402
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,073
A bike.

1403
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,641
Oh, a bike.

1404
01:02:58,741 --> 01:02:59,642
A bike!

1405
01:02:59,742 --> 01:03:01,043
He's got nothing.

1406
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:02,545
Neither do you.

1407
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,380
Don't you dare step one footinside my house

1408
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,082
with that stuff on you.

1409
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:07,784
But I...

1410
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:09,519
Use a hose.

1411
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,093
He has nothing.

1412
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:19,028
Absolutely nothing?

1413
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,463
Nada.Zero.

1414
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:21,464
Nothing.

1415
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,099
How do you know?

1416
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,368
I cannotreveal my source.

1417
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,369
But you're sure?

1418
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,470
Sure of what?

1419
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:31,574
Nothing.

1420
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:32,842
I heard you.

1421
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:33,942
What nothing?

1422
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:35,444
Nothing nothing.

1423
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:36,445
Okay.

1424
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:37,680
You,

1425
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,815
stay out of thisstupid competition

1426
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:40,817
your father haswith Mr. Jones,

1427
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:41,917
and you,

1428
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:43,619
don't you dare

1429
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:44,620
get him involved.

1430
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,588
He's too young,

1431
01:03:45,688 --> 01:03:47,790
and you're old enoughto know better.

1432
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:49,592
Now, you heardeveryone last night.

1433
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:50,692
You've got the same.

1434
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,561
It's a dead heat.

1435
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,129
There's no winner, no loser,

1436
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:54,096
so just quit

1437
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:55,998
while you're even!

1438
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:04,574
She's right.

1439
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,642
We're even,

1440
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:10,046
we're level, exactly the same,

1441
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:12,014
so that means

1442
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:14,450
we only need to getone more

1443
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,119
big, totally awesomedecoration...

1444
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,487
then I got him.

1445
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,089
I've got himgood and beat.

1446
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,023
You know howeveryone will know

1447
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:21,958
I got him goodand beat?

1448
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:22,892
No.

1449
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,093
It's perfect!

1450
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,204
We'll havean official judge,

1451
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:26,963
the mayor.

1452
01:04:27,063 --> 01:04:28,164
He will decide.

1453
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:31,167
Then the entire townwill see who's the man,

1454
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:32,935
and who's the loser.

1455
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,937
And just whatbrilliant decoration

1456
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:35,871
are you going tocome up with

1457
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:36,873
to pull this one off?

1458
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,574
I'll find something, my sweet.

1459
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,042
Trust me.

1460
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:43,779
That's good.

1461
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:49,785
Hey, hey!

1462
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:51,520
You haven't addedanything, have you?

1463
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:52,955
I'm changing the light bulb.

1464
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,690
Have you seen this?

1465
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,192
Yeah, I'veseen it, Stu.

1466
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:57,493
Have you entered?

1467
01:04:57,593 --> 01:04:58,694
I enter every year.

1468
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,563
Well, I'm entering today.

1469
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:02,665
Come Wednesdaywhen he
judges our decorations,

1470
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:04,500
the mayor is going toembarrass you

1471
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,935
in front of the entire town.

1472
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:07,203
Well, the way I see it,

1473
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:09,839
you are the one who's
going tobe red in the face,

1474
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:11,459
and frankly, that'll be an improvement.

1475
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:13,209
Well, if you're so confident,

1476
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,111
why don't we puta little wager on it?

1477
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:17,580
Say 50 bucks?

1478
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:19,916
50 bucks?

1479
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:22,118
Why don't we just betbottle
caps, you cheapskate?

1480
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:23,586
You got a better wager?

1481
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:24,587
Yeah,

1482
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:25,521
$100.

1483
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:26,656
Oh, I see,

1484
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,890
50's too small,

1485
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:30,126
but 100, that'sa real man's bet?

1486
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:31,226
It's better than 50,

1487
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:32,504
but if you want to
gohigher, I'll go higher.

1488
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:34,497
Yeah, yeah, I want to go higher.

1489
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:35,877
Well, fine! How about a thousand?

1490
01:05:35,931 --> 01:05:36,766
Fine with me.

1491
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:37,876
You sure you can afford it?

1492
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,111
Oh, I can afford it, and then some.

1493
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:40,636
Really? Then how about $2,000?

1494
01:05:41,804 --> 01:05:43,139
T-two...

1495
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,239
Are you kidding?

1496
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:45,341
Too much for you?

1497
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,718
You haven't got the
gutsfor a real bet, huh?

1498
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:47,877
No, I have gotthe guts!

1499
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:50,146
How about $5,000, huh?

1500
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:51,947
Have you got the guts for that?

1501
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:56,252
I would love to bet 5,000.

1502
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:57,853
Well, then, you're on!

1503
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,121
$5,000!

1504
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:00,323
In cash.

1505
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:04,660
You bet what?

1506
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:05,661
Are you insane!

1507
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:07,263
I mean, what withmoving here

1508
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:08,197
and you starting upa new practice,

1509
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,865
we don't have $5,000!

1510
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:11,634
Honey...

1511
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:13,135
Don't worry.

1512
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:14,870
I'm going to win!

1513
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,247
Hi.

1514
01:06:25,348 --> 01:06:26,549
Sorry I'm late.

1515
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,689
It's okay. I just got here.

1516
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,552
My dad, all he cares about

1517
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,120
is this stupiddecorating contest.

1518
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:32,955
Did you hear aboutthis bet thing?

1519
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:34,166
Yeah, my mom wasgoing crazy about it.

1520
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,825
I thought she was going tokill my dad.

1521
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:37,226
He's acting like a total dweeb.

1522
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,326
Mine too.

1523
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,729
Both our dads are.

1524
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,297
Anyway...

1525
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:42,665
So, what shall we do?

1526
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:43,845
You want to go see a movie?

1527
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,234
There's nothing I want to see.

1528
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:47,169
Have you beento the mall yet?

1529
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,804
We could go there.

1530
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:50,148
I'm not big ongoing to the mall.

1531
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:51,407
Me neither.

1532
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:54,142
We could go skating.

1533
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,612
Hey, dude, welcome to California.

1534
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:57,613
We don't have ice rinks here.

1535
01:06:57,713 --> 01:07:00,149
Well, we dosome places,

1536
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:02,618
but not in Richmond.

1537
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:04,687
You want to go bowling?

1538
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:06,222
Yeah. Great.

1539
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:08,224
Cool.

1540
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:28,244
Would you acceptthis peace offering?

1541
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:31,013
Oh, yes, that's so nice of you.

1542
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:31,881
Come in.

1543
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:32,748
No, actually, I...

1544
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:33,682
It's okay,

1545
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:34,884
Bob's not here.

1546
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:35,818
Oh.

1547
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:37,086
These look great.

1548
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,654
Thank you, yes.

1549
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:40,022
Did you make themyourself?

1550
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:41,190
Of course.

1551
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,692
Ooh..

1552
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:44,894
Hey, can I get youa coffee,

1553
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:46,662
or a sodaor something like that?

1554
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,364
Do you haveanything diet?

1555
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:49,832
I... have O.J.

1556
01:07:49,932 --> 01:07:52,101
No, no, just water, thank you.

1557
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:53,769
Okay, sure.

1558
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,738
Listen, I, um...

1559
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,306
I would like to talk to you

1560
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,217
about this bet our
husbandsmade this morning...

1561
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,643
Oh, please, say no more.

1562
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,212
Nobody is payinganybody $5,000

1563
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:04,947
because of somestupid contest they have.

1564
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:06,816
I'm so relieved, thank you,

1565
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,156
and I agreewith you completely.

1566
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:09,018
No, thank you.

1567
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,553
How on earth they ever

1568
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:11,787
let it get this far

1569
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:13,122
is just beyond me.

1570
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:14,890
Oh, I know.

1571
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,126
It ruined their
friendshiplike, 25 years ago.

1572
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:19,962
There's no reason it
shouldruin their lives now.

1573
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:21,197
Yes...

1574
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:22,731
Oh!

1575
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:23,999
Oh, these are amazing!

1576
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,000
Yes.

1577
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,869
I, uh, I gratethe cinnamon myself,

1578
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:30,239
and then I add a little tiny
bitof organic chopped pecans.

1579
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:31,674
Wow.

1580
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,209
I do think, you know,

1581
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:35,744
when they met againafter all these years,

1582
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:37,713
it was an opportunityfor them

1583
01:08:37,813 --> 01:08:39,081
to patch things up, you know?

1584
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:41,021
Not just pick up the
fightwhere they left off.

1585
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,985
Yeah, see, that's wherel blame myself.

1586
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:43,819
I mean...

1587
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:45,020
Why?

1588
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,431
Because when Bobput the
Santa Claus on the roof,

1589
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,424
I should never have let
Stuput up a bigger one.

1590
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:49,391
Oh, you know what,

1591
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,127
it's completely my fault.

1592
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:52,261
Yeah, it is.

1593
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:53,362
When you guys moved in,

1594
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:54,840
and you put upyour Christmas decorations

1595
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:55,931
on the very same day,

1596
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:58,701
there is no way I should
have let Bob go ahead

1597
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:00,402
and put upmore lights.

1598
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:02,304
Are you... are you saying it's my fault

1599
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:04,406
because I let Stu putour decorations up

1600
01:09:04,507 --> 01:09:06,141
the day we moved in?

1601
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:07,376
No, no, of course not.

1602
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,310
Oh, good.

1603
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:09,945
No...

1604
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:11,313
But, you know, I... I wonder,

1605
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:13,949
if you guys had waited just...

1606
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:16,051
just a couple of days,

1607
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,953
and maybe shown a littlemore consideration

1608
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:19,722
for what was normalon Honeyview Lane,

1609
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,457
then, I don't know,

1610
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:23,068
maybe this whole
thingwouldn't have happened.

1611
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:24,927
So then you are blaming me.

1612
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:26,395
No, no, I'm notblaming anyone.

1613
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,764
I just think it's bestto tread lightly

1614
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:30,342
when you move intoa new neighborhood,

1615
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:32,067
and just getthe lay of the land.

1616
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:33,545
Well, I don't thinkit's very neighborly

1617
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:35,704
to start a competitionwith
your new neighbors

1618
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:36,906
the very day they move in.

1619
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,875
Are you sayingthat I wasn't neighborly?

1620
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,520
Well, you're sayingl wasn't considerate.

1621
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:42,745
Well, you weren't!

1622
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:43,885
Oh, and you knowsomething?

1623
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:45,781
You were not neighborly!

1624
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,149
W-well...

1625
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:48,527
Well, fine. Here, take this dish, too.

1626
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:49,919
I certainly will,

1627
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,129
and I'll be sureto disinfect it

1628
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:53,055
after it's been insidethis... this...
pigsty!

1629
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:55,891
Oh, well, at least I'm notMrs.
OCD housewife!

1630
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:57,059
You know, Stu was so right

1631
01:09:57,159 --> 01:09:57,960
about you,

1632
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,140
about the whole lot of you!

1633
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:00,572
Oh, and I can just imaginewhat he said,

1634
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:03,098
coming froma lying cheat like him!

1635
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:04,867
- Stu is not a cheat!- He is so!

1636
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:06,769
This whole thing startedbecause he cheated!

1637
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,938
All right, that's it, the bet is on!

1638
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,038
The bet is on!

1639
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:11,373
$5,000 cash!

1640
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:12,241
Yeah, and you know something?

1641
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:13,509
Stu and I will beat you,

1642
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:14,510
and we'll beat youthe way we do everything,

1643
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,612
fair and square.

1644
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:17,947
Oh, well, "fair and square,"

1645
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,281
and you know what,

1646
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:24,153
I think chopped pecansin
ginger cookies is just dumb!

1647
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:29,158
I had fun.

1648
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:30,259
So did I.

1649
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:31,927
I hadn't gone bowlingfor ages.

1650
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:33,195
You were awesome.

1651
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:34,430
I was lucky.

1652
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:35,331
My dad saysit takes talent and luck

1653
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:36,832
to be good at anything.

1654
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:39,101
I wonder what our dads

1655
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:40,436
have done now?

1656
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:43,072
Nothing, I hope.

1657
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,975
So, will I see you again?

1658
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:48,310
We live across the street.

1659
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,379
I mean, will I "see you" see you?

1660
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:52,281
Yeah, I hope so.

1661
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:53,816
When?

1662
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,517
Tomorrow?

1663
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:03,425
See you tomorrow.

1664
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:11,934
How about another Santa?

1665
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:13,211
Oh, no, I've seen all the Santas.

1666
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:14,236
There's nothing special.

1667
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:15,404
Okay, how about

1668
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,073
some elves to go withthe
Santa that we've got?

1669
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:19,253
No, it's gotto be something

1670
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:20,409
totally unique.

1671
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:22,120
You know, something
Stuwould never think of.

1672
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:23,188
We only have three more days.

1673
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:27,049
We have to think of something.

1674
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:28,917
Honey, do you thinkour house is a pigsty?

1675
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:30,219
What?

1676
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:31,319
What?

1677
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:34,489
Huh?

1678
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,329
What are you asking me?

1679
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:41,497
Do you thinkour house

1680
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:43,232
is a pigsty?

1681
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:44,867
No.

1682
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:45,968
You just like it relaxed.

1683
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:48,270
You know, lived-in.

1684
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:50,039
I like that. It's good.

1685
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,573
Okay, you.

1686
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:54,310
Come here.

1687
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,311
Mmm?

1688
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:59,148
Hello...

1689
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:04,386
Sweetie?

1690
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,159
Okay, you come here.

1691
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:11,360
Okay.

1692
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,995
Okay.

1693
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:33,015
Uh-huh.

1694
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:33,982
Bye!

1695
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,084
Yeah, okay...

1696
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:36,518
Yes. Okay.

1697
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:37,653
Yes!

1698
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:38,520
Yes...

1699
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:39,388
What's going on?

1700
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:40,656
I've got it!

1701
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:42,467
I've got it. It's perfect.
Stu will never think of it.

1702
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:43,491
What is it? What? What?

1703
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:44,393
You knowMaclntire's Department Store?

1704
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:45,594
It closed last summer.

1705
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:46,528
Exactly!

1706
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:48,230
They're auctioningeverything off.

1707
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,532
You remember that big
angelthey had in the lobby?

1708
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:51,533
The angel!

1709
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,001

1712
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:01,677
Oh, oh, oh, where's Susie?

1713
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:03,479
Susie!

1714
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:06,248
Susie, Susie, watch Tim for us.

1715
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:08,050
I'm busy, Mom.

1716
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,586
I'm only going to be gonean hour.

1717
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:11,420
Where are you going?

1718
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,354
You're not getting

1719
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:13,614
more decoration junk, are you?

1720
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:15,366
No, no, we're just goingChristmas shopping.

1721
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:17,025
Mom... Where?

1722
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:19,027
Maclntire's.

1723
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:20,271
We're not goingto Maclntire's.

1724
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:21,339
The auction'sat the art gallery.

1725
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:22,631
I know that,

1726
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:24,566
but if Stu asks Chipwhere we're going,

1727
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:26,301
it'll throw himoff the track.

1728
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,536
Right.

1729
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:39,424
I thoughtyou were going out

1730
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,083
with that Wallacegirl today.

1731
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:42,423
She has to babysit her brother.

1732
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:43,318
Well, that's what you get

1733
01:13:43,418 --> 01:13:45,220
for fraternizingwith the enemy.

1734
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,722
Susie's not the enemy.

1735
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,257
Did they saywhere they're going?

1736
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:50,292
Christmas shopping.

1737
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:51,727
Where?

1738
01:13:51,827 --> 01:13:54,062
Some department storecalled Maclntire's.

1739
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:55,707
Don't interrogate me on this.
I don't want to be part of it.

1740
01:13:55,731 --> 01:13:56,731
Maclntire's?

1741
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:58,066
I... I read somethingabout that.

1742
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,334

1743
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,336
Garage.

1744
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,274
Ick!

1745
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:08,376
Oh, my god...

1746
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,444
Oh...

1747
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,282

What?

1751
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:19,654
It's my best sweater.

1752
01:14:20,722 --> 01:14:21,557
It's been closed since July!

1753
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:23,125
Just let me see it, let me see it.

1754
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:25,694
Yes, but they're stillselling off

1755
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:26,562
some of their stuff,

1756
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:28,163
including a Christmas angel.

1757
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:29,765
Oh.

1758
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:30,766

I'm sorry, rules are rules.

1776
01:15:11,506 --> 01:15:13,275
No, no, no, no such thing as rules.

1777
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,511
If you want the angelthat badly,

1778
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:16,654
you'll have to tryto get the new owner

1779
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:17,678
to sell it to you.

1780
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:18,790
Oh, please don't tell meit's Bob Wallace.

1781
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:19,858
Please don'ttell me it's Bob Wallace!

1782
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,150
No, Mr. Wallace's bidcame in second.

1783
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:23,318
Who did buy it?

1784
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:24,486
An anonymous bidder.

1785
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:26,121
Okay.

1786
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,490
Okay, so what are yougoing to do now, Stu?

1787
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,825
'Cause we don't have $5,000.

1788
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:31,727
So, what are you going to do?

1789
01:15:54,249 --> 01:15:57,386
This is all your fault.
You know that, don't you?

1790
01:15:57,486 --> 01:16:01,456
And I don't just meanthis
stupid bet with Bob.

1791
01:16:01,556 --> 01:16:03,725
I mean this whole warwith Bob.

1792
01:16:03,825 --> 01:16:04,825
You cheated first.

1793
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,495
You're the onewho stole his customers.

1794
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:09,364
Well, I wantedthe red motorbike.

1795
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:10,575
Yeah, well, you didn'tget it, did you?

1796
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:11,500
No.

1797
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,135
And you lostyour best friend

1798
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:14,670
not winning it, didn't you?

1799
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,371
Yeah.

1800
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:20,242
Take me home.

1801
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:26,682
Can I have the keys?

1802
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,154
Well, you'd betterthink of something.

1803
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:36,591
We can't affordto lose $5,000.

1804
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,595
Another card from the Walkers.

1805
01:16:39,695 --> 01:16:40,796
Oh, good,

1806
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:42,798
another pictureof their goofy kids.

1807
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:45,834
They're not that goofy.

1808
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:51,373
Bob, why are we

1809
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:53,475
over $4,700 behind

1810
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:54,710
in ourproperty taxes?

1811
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:55,577
What?

1812
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:56,754
We're not behind on our taxes.

1813
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:57,913
It says right here

1814
01:16:58,013 --> 01:16:59,181
if we don't payimmediately,

1815
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,315
plus the late fees,

1816
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:02,384
they're going to... foreclose on our house.

1817
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:05,621
Let me see that.

1818
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,923
No, this isfor 410 Honeyview lane.

1819
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:09,925
We're 408.

1820
01:17:10,025 --> 01:17:11,827
It's Mrs. McKane's.

1821
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:14,262
Oh, no.

1822
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:16,283
She hasn't paid her
taxesfor the past few years.

1823
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:18,533
Oh...

1824
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,994
She can't affordto keep her house,

1825
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,846
and we're throwing away
moneyon more decorations

1826
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,706
than the entire towncould use.

1827
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,942
Plus making betswe can't afford.

1828
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:28,744
Well, it's too late now.

1829
01:17:28,844 --> 01:17:30,204
I'll take this overin the morning.

1830
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:37,386
Yeah, hello.

1831
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:41,356
Hold, please.

1832
01:17:41,456 --> 01:17:42,357
Susie!

1833
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:43,692
Susie!

1834
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:45,360
It's that Jones boy!

1835
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:52,634
Hi!

1836
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:54,202
Sure, when?

1837
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:56,872
Okay, I'll be therein a minute.

1838
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:58,340
Hey, hey, whereare you going?

1839
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,709
I'm going outsideto talk to Chip.

1840
01:18:00,809 --> 01:18:02,209
You just talked to himon the phone.

1841
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:04,479
He wants to see me.

1842
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:09,885
Poor Mrs. McKane.

1843
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:10,985
Where are you going?

1844
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:12,087
Bed.

1845
01:18:19,694 --> 01:18:22,564
I've been thinking.

1846
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:23,704
In a couple of days' time,

1847
01:18:23,799 --> 01:18:25,076
we're going to havea winner and loser

1848
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:26,668
in this wholedecorating contest thing,

1849
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:29,004
and the loser'sgot to pay $5,000.

1850
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:31,606
That's not exactly going
tobring our parents closer.

1851
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,708
Do you really think our dads

1852
01:18:33,809 --> 01:18:34,819
are going tohold each other

1853
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:35,843
to this stupid bet?

1854
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:36,978
My dad would,

1855
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:39,281
and your dad's going tohate me if he loses.

1856
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:40,382
My dad wouldn't hate you.

1857
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:41,516
He's not like that.

1858
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:42,616
He hates mealready.

1859
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,853
I'm "that Jones boy,"

1860
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:45,997
and you're "that Wallace girl"

1861
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:47,422
to my dad.

1862
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:49,357
What am I doing?

1863
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:50,859
It's never going to work.

1864
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:51,726
What?

1865
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:52,961
Us.

1866
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:54,996
How can it?

1867
01:18:55,097 --> 01:18:56,798
You're breaking up with me?

1868
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:57,909
I thought we liked each other.

1869
01:18:57,933 --> 01:18:59,835
We do.

1870
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:01,369
I... I really like you.

1871
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,371
It's just...

1872
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:04,673
It's impossibleenough now

1873
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:06,041
with our dadshating each other,

1874
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:07,476
and when one of themwins the bet

1875
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,477
and the other one loses,

1876
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:09,811
it's going toget worse.

1877
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,780
This is the worstChristmas ever.

1878
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:15,550
I hate you.

1879
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:51,653
She's right.

1880
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:55,023
This is the worstChristmas ever.

1881
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:23,445
We've got to callthe bet off.

1882
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:26,615
What?

1883
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,017
Stu, one of us winning,
one of us losing tomorrow

1884
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:30,785
is not going to bethe end of this.

1885
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,520
It's just going to bethe beginning.

1886
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:35,123
We're destroyingChristmas!

1887
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,492
My daughterhates me now.

1888
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:39,761
Before you know it, your
son is going to hate you.

1889
01:21:39,861 --> 01:21:41,239
Then our wives are going tohate both of us.

1890
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:42,397
Where's it going to end?

1891
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:45,567
You know what'sterrible?

1892
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:48,036
25 years ago,

1893
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,705
we threw awaythe best friendship

1894
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:54,009
that two guys could have,

1895
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:55,109
and now,

1896
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:57,479
when we get a chanceto make it right,

1897
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:00,315
we don't seize it, we're
just making it worse!

1898
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:05,887
We've got to changewhile we can.

1899
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:08,823
You're right.

1900
01:22:08,923 --> 01:22:10,325
We're idiots.

1901
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,529
I'm sorry.

1902
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:17,632
So am I.

1903
01:22:24,973 --> 01:22:26,973
I'm so glad to have youback
in my life, my friend.

1904
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:29,177
Me too.

1905
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:36,084
So, I've gota proposition for you.

1906
01:22:36,184 --> 01:22:38,119
Our neighbor, Mrs. McKane,

1907
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:40,055
she's going to lose her house

1908
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:41,732
'cause she can't affordto pay her taxes.

1909
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:43,625
So I was thinking,

1910
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:44,965
we could take halfof that money

1911
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:46,594
that we were going to bet

1912
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:47,738
and... and we could help her out.

1913
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:51,766
Bob, I... I don't evenhave $2,500.

1914
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:54,602
The only way I wasgoing
to get $5,000 was...

1915
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:57,038
was if I won.

1916
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,909
Well, then, you know something?

1917
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:03,378
I got a better idea.

1918
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:09,084
Hello, Mrs. McKane, merry Christmas!

1919
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,019
Oh, my goodness!

1920
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:13,121
What can I do for you all?

1921
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:14,622
We're here todecorate your house.

1922
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:16,591
That's right!

1923
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:17,892
How about it, huh?

1924
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:18,993
Really?

1925
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,161
It... it's going to rain.

1926
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:22,831
We have to get itdone by tonight.

1927
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:25,100
Oh, that's a wonderful idea!

1928
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,868
Oh, merry Christmas!

1929
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:45,020
So, Earl,

1930
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,655
what do you think of my
Christmas decorations now?

1931
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:48,990
Too flashy for you, I suppose?

1932
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:52,260
I think they look wonderful.

1933
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,797
It could useone finishing touch, though.

1934
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,334
Set it up right there, guys.

1935
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:00,668
It'll look great there.

1936
01:24:00,769 --> 01:24:05,774
♪ Harkthe herald angels sing ♪

1937
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:12,013

01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:15,250

1941

1942
01:24:18,052 --> 01:24:19,087
I figuredyour Christmas

1943
01:24:19,187 --> 01:24:20,655
needed cheering up.

1944
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:22,557
I was going to give itto you Christmas Eve,

1945
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:23,758
but then I figured

1946
01:24:23,858 --> 01:24:25,760
today was a better day.

1947
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:27,028
Oh, thank you.

1948
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:28,763
Oh, the lights!

1949
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,486
Oh, it's the mayor.

1950
01:24:52,887 --> 01:24:53,888
Hello.

1951
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:05,733

01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,339
I must have seenover 500 houses

1955

1956
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:13,842

1957
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,243
Now, this houseis beautiful,

1958
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:17,512
but I've seena lot of beautiful houses,

1959
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,290
and so I decided to considerall the houses

1960
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:21,850
from one more perspective.

1961
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:25,253
Which housewould be the best example

1962
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:27,422
