1
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,714
<i>Ready? On'? I think it is.</i>

2
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,825
<i>Is it running?</i>

3
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:18,487
<i>[woman] Yeah, go. Wait, no, hang on,
I'm not. Action!</i>

4
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,424
<i>So where should we start, you think'?</i>

5
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:28,907
<i>[woman] Just introduce yourself
and tell me about your company.</i>

6
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,736
<i>You wanna do
a push up or something?</i>

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,934
- No.
- OK.

8
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,877
OK.

9
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,476
Hi, I'm Beatle Boy...
That's stupid, OK?

10
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,135
<i>[woman] it's not, ifs cool.
Do it again.</i>

11
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,687
<i>Hf, there, I'm Beetle Boyin,
and I'm gonna be your guide</i>

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,250
<i>on the fascinating journey through
the world of cold-blooded killing.</i>

13
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,994
<i>[woman] Tell me about yourself, Beetle.</i>

14
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:59,668
Uh... <i>ever want to kill somebody?
I know I do.</i>

15
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,102
<i>Whoa, sorry.</i>

16
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,232
<i>Not a Hitman, you say.
Well, that's not a problem.</i>

17
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:10,212
<i>Just follow the instructions in my easy
to follow video, and you too.</i> ..

18
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,106
<i>Woman} Nah, that sounds weird.</i>

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,087
- <i>How many times do we have to do this?</i>
- <i>What do you think? We got everything?</i>

20
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,384
<i>'Till I want to buy the video.</i>

21
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,656
<i>Hi, there, my name is Beetle Boyin,</i>

22
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,661
<i>and I'm here with
the first ever of its kind,</i>

23
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,698
<i>instructional video for Hitmen.</i>

24
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:30,461
<i>Ever want to kill someone?
I know I do.</i>

25
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:34,731
<i>It's easy, just follow the instructions
in my video, and you, too,</i>

26
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,171
<i>can be a Hitman.</i>

27
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:39,700
<i>[woman] That was really good.</i>

28
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,547
[man] This is some really, really
great stuff here, Beatle.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,780
I mean it's just clown right
entertaining all the way around.

30
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,482
You know What I like about it
the most though?

31
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,992
That even though the footage
is several years old.

32
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,225
There is no
statue of limitations on murder.

33
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,168
You know What that is?

34
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,400
Let me jog your memory. Dead body.

35
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,241
In your loft about seven years ago.

36
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,003
No? Nothing?

37
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:21,510
Well, based on the evidence at the time,
we couldn't charge you with a crime.

38
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,315
But that's all changed now hasn't it?

39
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,819
Still not ringing a bell, huh?

40
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,191
OK.

41
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,023
Maybe this will help.

42
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,426
Why don't you tell me about
your relationship with Athena Glendon?

43
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,671
L-low about Carla Garret?

44
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,769
You care to explain that one to me?

45
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:57,588
So you don't wanna talk about Athena,
you don't wanna talk about Carla?

46
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,488
Well, maybe we should
talk about Kyle Sullivan? L-Hm'?

47
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,687
L-low bout we talk about the time
when you knocked him unconscious?

48
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,862
Did your connection to Kyle
kinda slip your mind

49
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,917
when you were giving
your statement to the police?

50
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,435
Look we got him now, OK'?

51
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,604
And I gotta do everything I can
to keep this guy locked up.

52
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,906
So here's the deal.

53
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,149
You tell me everything you know.

54
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:33,256
And I'll do What I can in getting this
first degree murder charge reduced.

55
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:38,224
- Can I ask you a question, Randy?
- It's Detective Hult.

56
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,822
Hmm. Do you see handcuffs on my wrists?

57
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,059
No.

58
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:49,835
OK, then. I think we can both agree
that I am not under arrest. Correct?

59
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,611
And I think we both know that's because
you can't charge me with anything.

60
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,772
Unless you can prove it.

61
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:59,543
Oh, I intend to, believe me, I do.

62
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:04,450
You see when we brought Kyle Sullivan
down and we Went through his stuff.

63
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,046
I think you're gonna be
surprised to know

64
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,989
that he had an awful lot of
information lying around.

65
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,619
But What I think you're gonna be
more surprised about Beatle?

66
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:16,690
Is that some of that evidence tells
a very compelling story about you.

67
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,538
I like to call it,
The Adventures of Beatle.

68
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:27,033
And it all begins April the 27th, 2006.

69
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,106
<i>The day you met Athena Glendon.</i>

70
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,559
[gasps]

71
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:33,093
Uh, wait, uh.
It's four o'clock in the morning,

72
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:37,532
don't you think that you should,
um, stay and just get some rest?

73
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:41,366
Gotta run. See you next week.

74
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,532
[alarm ringing, meowing]

75
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,216
Shut... Shut up!

76
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,327
<i>[man] The red hot action
starts tonight, at eight,</i>

77
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,665
<i>followed by an all new episode</i> of...

78
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,831
<i>woman} Isn't that the truth Phil'?</i>

79
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:21,105
- <i>Well, folks, it's Thursday April 27th.</i>
- <i>Thursday.</i> Shit!

80
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,770
<i>We have a foggy start this morning.</i>

81
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:38,921
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Shit. Shit!

82
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,557
Have a nice trip, buddy.

83
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:19,234
OK, so, What's the total
for all the parking tickets?

84
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,640
What?

85
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:27,144
No. No, I'm still here.

86
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,270
Are you sure that's right? I mean...

87
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:33,111
I know it's eight tickets
but you could feed a family of four

88
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,515
for three fucking months
with that kind of money.

89
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,019
No, I'm not.

90
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:42,384
Don't get snippy with me. Ma'am.

91
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,351
According to Athena's
bank statements at the time.

92
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:50,400
She had approximately
negative $27.38 to her name.

93
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:54,198
But Athena didn't get the money
from you did she? She got it from Kyle.

94
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,299
You know the guy
that you beat the shit out of?

95
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,374
I really don't get Where you're
going with this, Randy.

96
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,141
It's Detective Hult.

97
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,944
And Where I'm going is Kyle Sullivan.

98
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:12,013
- [horn honking outside]
- So it's come to this has it?

99
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,026
- You know I'll pay you back.
- I know you will, I know you will.

100
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,093
You realize, of course,

101
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,561
you're going to have to pay it
back in more ways than one.

102
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,393
You know my situation, Kyle.

103
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,467
Yeah, well, I know if you were still
managing the store for me

104
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,933
you wouldn't need to be
borrowing any money.

105
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,230
Yeah, and from What I understand,

106
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,896
they give you free room and board
in prison, so you're probably right.

107
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,635
Meanwhile,
I have a regular legal job as a career

108
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,268
and my car is sort of an
integral part of that.

109
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,142
- Ah.
- You gonna help me, or not?

110
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,578
Why should I?

111
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,178
I don't know.

112
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,776
Kyle, why don't you think of it
as workman's comp

113
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,755
for this krink in my neck
I'm getting from looking the other Way.

114
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,988
Well, you knovv, Athena, I'd be happy
to rub that out for you myself.

115
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,859
- Stop.
- Oh, just calm clown, tootsie pops.

116
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,024
Sit clown.

117
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,300
Should I make it out to cash?

118
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,498
No, just to the city.

119
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,373
I don't have time to cash it.
They are going to tow my car at three.

120
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,577
I'll call you tonight.

121
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,414
Next!

122
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,762
Hi, um... I have a boot on my car.

123
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,230
We don't take checks.

124
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,096
Oh, but, um...
I just, I spoke to someone.

125
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,692
We don't take checks, people!

126
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,766
The lady on the phone.

127
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,037
We don't take checks.

128
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,406
The lady on the phone said you did.

129
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:47,584
I'm sorry but What do her
DMV issues have to do with me?

130
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,082
I Want to talk about your doctor.

131
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,853
- Who?
- Your shrink.

132
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,727
I Want to talk about Dr. Vanderark.

133
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,998
OK.

134
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,295
I would appreciate it if you would
apologize to my secretary

135
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,994
before you leave today.

136
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,333
- Why?
- I think you know why.

137
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,634
- Can I help you?
- I very seriously doubt it.

138
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,175
You can't go in there,
he's with a patient,

139
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:13,766
and you can not smoke!

140
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,645
There. Happy?

141
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,241
[Hult] We'll come back to that.

142
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,149
So you were making trouble.

143
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,586
While Athena was having
her own problems.

144
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,715
I mean What makes you think

145
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,225
that I have that kind of cash
just lying around?

146
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,263
Does it seem like I've been
lobotomized in the past six months?

147
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,964
Turn around. Turn around!

148
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,775
You knovv, you have a really
nice ass, Athena.

149
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,039
You should think about
wearing shorter dresses.

150
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,686
OK, you can turn around.

151
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,647
<i>Now, why don't you take my oar,</i>

152
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,454
you're gonna be
coming back here anyway, right?

153
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,051
- Yeah.
- Yeah, good.

154
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,654
OK. It's yours.

155
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,958
So she goes to this guy for cash
and gets the keys to the car.

156
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,035
Uh-huh?

157
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,663
The oar that later breaks clown
and bingo, he calls a tow truck, you!

158
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,298
A tow truck?

159
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,703
So now I'm a tow truck driver,
not an assassin?

160
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,213
Well, every assassin has a cover, right?

161
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,577
<i>[Dr. Vanderark]
Yes, and you were saying?</i>

162
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:30,677
Oh, yeah. So, I Went to go
kill this guy today, right.

163
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:35,020
And before I did, I sorta said that
I thought that he might deserve it.

164
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:39,328
And then I got to thinking about it
later and I realized that,

165
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:44,060
that wasn't really a very nice
thing to say. So, I felt bad.

166
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,501
- I wanna stop you right there, Ronda.
- Don't say it!

167
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,903
Let's not get distracted
from the matter at hand.

168
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:54,341
Why do you insist on this fantasy
of being an assassin?

169
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:58,904
- It's not a fantasy. It's true.
- No. It's not.

170
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:05,279
Personally, I think an assassin
sounds better than a tow truck driver.

171
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,984
So now you're admitting to being
an assassin? Which is it?

172
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,082
You tell me.

173
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,562
Next.

174
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:23,062
I'm back. And I have cash now.

175
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,345
[typing]

176
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,061
Eight hundred nineteen dollars,
twenty-three cents.

177
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,489
Shit.

178
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,899
The meter...

179
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,867
I had to... I had to pay the meter
I must have miscalculated. I...

180
00:14:55,461 --> 00:15:00,467
This is all the money I have in the
world, I had to borrow it to pay this.

181
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,239
So you have to pay the whole thing.

182
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,649
Are you serious?
It's ten cents.

183
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,242
Sorry. You have to pay the whole thing.

184
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,183
You're not sorry.

185
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:20,458
Are you, you certainly should be.
But you're not. Not at all are you?

186
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,031
- No.
- Shit!

187
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,960
[coughs] Next.

188
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,333
No.
Is this funny, you think this is funny?

189
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,133
You... you think it's funny that my car

190
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,265
has a gaudy hunk
of orange metal on it right now,

191
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,400
and the only Way for me
to get it off before it gets towed

192
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:39,711
is to borrow $819 from a man
I'm already indebted to

193
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,614
for the rest of my natural life?

194
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,778
You think it's funny that I got here
first thing this morning?

195
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,755
I Waited two fricken hours
only to have you to tell me

196
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:47,949
I have to have cash,

197
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,153
when I called before
to make sure you take checks

198
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,888
and I was told that you do.

199
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,760
Is there some sort of humor
in the fact

200
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,924
that it's now almost
four o'clock in the afternoon

201
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,730
and for all I know you've towed my
fucking car already,

202
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:03,637
and you can't help me out
with ten fucking cents.

203
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:09,338
When I'm already paying $819
to you goddamn highway robber.

204
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,039
Where's the fucking punchline, asshole?

205
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:15,243
Because I'm obviously
not too quick on the pickup today.

206
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,411
[exhales]

207
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,953
No.

208
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:22,924
Sorry, you have to pay the whole thing.

209
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,291
Does anyone have a dime I can borrow?

210
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,794
It doesn't have to be a dime, um...

211
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,566
Two nickles?

212
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:34,235
- [man coughs]
- Nickle and five pennies?

213
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,170
<i>'</i> AFR/body? Please?
<i>'</i> [man] Sorry.

214
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,610
Here, senorita.

215
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,471
- Thank you. Thank you.
- De nada.

216
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:01,625
Look, I'll grant you, I do enjoy
a little artistic flare here and there.

217
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,166
It helps me fill in the occasional gap,
you know What I mean?

218
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:08,204
I actually think that
it makes things more interesting.

219
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,208
For example, the DMV may have
been a bit more like...

220
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,676
Seriously, we don't take checks.

221
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,779
As opposed to my version,

222
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,877
which you have to admit
is far more entertaining, right?

223
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,456
Here you are, picking up a payment.

224
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,602
- Payment for What?
- For a hit, of course.

225
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:42,661
- Oh, because I'm an assassin.
- Well, aren't you?

226
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,604
What does the evidence say?

227
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:49,004
You knovv, that park has had
security surveillance cameras

228
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,012
in operation for over a decade?

229
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,845
And they take a shot every 45 seconds.

230
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:58,649
Oh, and please if you will,
Beatle, note the time stamp right there.

231
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,291
You've got to fucking
love those things, right?

232
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:07,762
They're absolutely incredible
at placing a certain individual

233
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:12,495
in a certain spot, at a certain time,
Doing a certain thing.

234
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:17,331
And in some cases,
committing a certain crime.

235
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,171
- It's certainly detailed.
- Yeah.

236
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:26,375
So While I may be guilty of peppering in
a little artistic flare here and there.

237
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,612
The one thing that you can be sure of
is that where the facts are concerned,

238
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,054
the parts that really matter,

239
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:40,590
I absolutely have all the evidence
I need to take this to a court of law.

240
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,734
Care to explain this receipt to me?

241
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:53,965
I'll tell you What I think happened.

242
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,536
I'll tell you What I think happened.

243
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,880
<i>Kyle's car breaks down
and he calls a towing company.</i>

244
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:06,719
You. You show up, you see
he's giving her a hard time.

245
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,656
<i>He's got his hands around her neck,
and he's strangling her.</i>

246
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,020
<i>So you decide to knock him out, right.</i>

247
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:24,199
What did you use?
A tire iron, a wrench?

248
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,576
Come on, Beatle, am I getting warm?

249
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:37,085
Beatle Boyin Towing/Assassination?

250
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,148
You the mighty assassin,
you bust up Kyle,

251
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,455
and you Whisk away
your damsel in distress, Athena.

252
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,361
I've got to be getting
warm now, right, Beatle?

253
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,056
I don't know.

254
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,493
- You know What I think, Beatle?
- What?

255
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,536
I think you were sweet on Athena.

256
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,373
[up-tempo song in background]

257
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,138
<i>So, uh, how much do you charge'?</i>

258
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,078
- Depends.
- On What?

259
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,279
On What you're looking for.

260
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:11,320
I give a discount for child molesters,
Wife beaters, the occasional pimp.

261
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,253
Also, you have to factor in travel,

262
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,758
method of execution, risk...
yada, yada, yada.

263
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,389
- What about me?
- What about you?

264
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,260
L-low much for you to kill me'?

265
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,961
- You ever mess with a kid?
- No.

266
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,773
This should answer
any questions you might have.

267
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,149
You put this in writing?

268
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,985
Yeah, how else are you going to know
what you get yourself in to'?

269
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,582
What if you get caught?
Are you afraid they'll find this?

270
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,418
Well, if I get caught then it
won't really matter will it'?

271
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,793
So, Athena Glendon.

272
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,871
Any relation to the multi-billion
software company, Glendon?

273
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:08,210
Barton Glendon is my father.
He disowned me years ago.

274
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,271
- Is that why you Want to die?
- No.

275
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,847
So why do you Want to die then?

276
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,216
It's really none
of your business, is it?

277
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,449
[chuckles]
Well, now my curiosity is peaked.

278
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:24,687
- Aw, I'm so sorry about your...
- OK, ladies, what's it gonna be'?

279
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,854
How's the eggs florentine here?

280
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,192
You gotta death wish?

281
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:34,598
Uh, I guess I'll have
one of these then.

282
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,036
One of What, hon?

283
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,709
The little eggy deally here.

284
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,769
We've got umpteen egg dishes here,
sweetheart, which one do you Want?

285
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,209
This one.

286
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,308
I left my glasses in my other apron.

287
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:59,827
The egg-stra me-egga
del-egg-table spec-egg-tacular.

288
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:07,393
- And you?
- Um, nothing thank you.

289
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,239
Eggs florentine would be
a hell of a lot cheaper than me.

290
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,284
Uh, probably, but I can't afford it.

291
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,418
So now are you planning on
paying for me then?

292
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,581
Well, I have a life insurance policy.

293
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,317
It's the one thing my parents
didn't take away from me.

294
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:34,329
So, I figure I'd change it,
make you the beneficiary.

295
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,762
More than cover your fee.

296
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,095
You just have this
all figured out don't you?

297
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,569
I need a place to stay
While I work out the details.

298
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,267
As soon as, uh, Kyle Wakes up
from the coma, you put him in,

299
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,867
he's gonna come looking for me.

300
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,681
- And?
- He'll kill me.

301
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,973
[chuckles]

302
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,085
Well, it seems you'd be saving us
both a whole lot of trouble then

303
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,916
if you just Went home
and got knocked out for free.

304
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,251
Not like that, not by him.

305
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,257
What difference
does it make who does it?

306
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,089
You serious?

307
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,424
Yeah, I mean, who cares as long as
the job gets done?

308
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,557
- I do.
- And I'm asking you why?

309
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:11,929
Because I hate him.

310
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,094
And I don't Want my last moments
on this earth to be spent

311
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:15,671
anywhere near him, I just...

312
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:19,132
I can't think of
a worse tragedy than that.

313
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,970
And What makes you think that
spending your last moments with me

314
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,308
is going to be any better?

315
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,517
I like you.

316
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,387
Randy, I'm really confused.

317
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:45,095
Detective Hult.

318
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,932
What's this first degree murder charge
you're threatening me with?

319
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,767
Don't play stupid.

320
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:54,344
Is the possibility of
a death sentence not enough for you?

321
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,778
- Huh?
- The death penalty for killing who?

322
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,815
OK, let me get this straight.

323
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:03,045
Are you saying that
this story so far is not true?

324
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:05,849
I'm not saying anything.

325
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,490
Bruce?

326
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:21,965
Bummer.

327
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,536
Look, boss, she can't get
too far Without cash or a car.

328
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,303
Just find the gypsy,
you'll find Athena.

329
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,709
Actually, boss, I think
the proper term would be.

330
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,407
Roma or Romani, not Gypsy.

331
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,678
Yeah, you see it's a common
misconception stemming from

332
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:38,186
the erroneous conjecture
that the Roma or Romani,

333
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:40,222
if you will, originated in Egypt.

334
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,985
Recent studies have shown
the fact that they...

335
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,424
Bruce. Just find them.

336
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:49,565
Oh, and Bruce,
don't touch either of them.

337
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,828
Bring them both back here.
I want to help this time.

338
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:28,632
[door opens]

339
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:38,846
You in some kind of
a coma or something?

340
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,899
Seriously, should I be looking for

341
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,215
a piece of candy
or a wallet to shove in your mouth?

342
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,755
Maybe one of those long ass needles
to plunge into your chest?

343
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,684
Hello?

344
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:54,996
Why do you have
a wall full of dead spiders?

345
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:00,402
Oh, yeah. Those...

346
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:04,537
I keep them there as kind of a
warning to any other spiders

347
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,074
that might wander through here.

348
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,974
That Way they can glimpse their
fate and decide whether or not

349
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,603
they Want to hang around to meet it.

350
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:15,173
Huh, and did it ever occur
you after the fourth or fifth time

351
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:18,049
that your plan wasn't
working out so Well?

352
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:19,247
What do you mean?

353
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:23,087
Are you serious, there has got to be
97 spiders on this wall.

354
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,159
And?

355
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,423
And they don't understand
they're spiders.

356
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,396
How do you know
they don't understand,

357
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,967
are you some very
unusual spider psychic?

358
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:35,664
Are there perished souls
speaking to you right now, Ms. Cleo?

359
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,741
I'm looking at the wall and I'm taking
a wild stab in the dark here,

360
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,811
I'm guessing, if they understood your
twisted little warning sign,

361
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,403
probably wouldn't be
a part of it right now.

362
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:46,641
So in your infinitely wise logic

363
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,979
that I am obviously
too cabbage-headed to grasp.

364
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,611
You're saying that if those spiders
knew that if I was going to kill them

365
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,311
then they wouldh't be in my house.
Right?

366
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,356
Now you're catching on.

367
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:58,519
Because if they knew and they stayed,
that would make them What?

368
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,724
What would that make them?

369
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:06,262
So there is a wall
full of dead spiders?

370
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,163
What does that have to do
with anything?

371
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,637
It has to do with you, Beatle.

372
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:15,109
Your character, you're a killer
and you enjoy killing things.

373
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,513
So this is just me letting you know
that I knovv, I see it,

374
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,812
and I'm going to make sure
a jury sees it.

375
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:28,182
So you think that I kill things
because I enjoy it?

376
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,158
Maybe, then again, maybe not.

377
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,423
I don't knovv,
I'm not a psychiatrist I'm a cop.

378
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:39,896
The point is you entered into a contract
with Athena Clendon to kill her.

379
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,135
Change that life insurance policy yet?

380
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,336
Yes.

381
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,610
It takes seven to ten
business days before it's final.

382
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:57,182
- Seven to ten business days, huh?
- Why?

383
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:01,389
The assassination fee's one thing,
but room and board for two Weeks?

384
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,160
We're going to have to
work something out here.

385
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,025
I told you, I don't have any money. OK?

386
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,689
And just because
my last name is Glendon,

387
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:11,788
don't think you'll see
a dime of that money either.

388
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,600
You... You could chop off
my tits and send them to him

389
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,813
in an empty Ding-Dong box,
they wouldn't even send you

390
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,363
a quarter and a pack of chewing gum.

391
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,170
So whatever's going through
your head right now...

392
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:21,801
Whoa there, hose. Reel it in.

393
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,980
Nobody is talking about
medieval torture around here.

394
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,311
I'm not even talking about money,
for fucks sake.

395
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:34,023
Oh... Now I get...

396
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,150
My gaydar isn't quite as acute
as it used to be but it...

397
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,020
It makes sense.

398
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,791
Um, before you embarrass
yourself even further.

399
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,457
I'm not talking about sex either.

400
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,270
You don't Want money,
you don't Want sex.

401
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,303
Right. Well, not from you anyway.

402
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,966
What do you mean not from me?

403
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,544
I... I happen to be
a very attractive woman.

404
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,977
Who most people would out
their right arm off to be with.

405
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,047
When I was in high school...

406
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,738
Why is everything
an amputation with you?

407
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,182
Every other sentence out of your mouth,

408
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,253
some unfortunate asshole
is loosing a body part.

409
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,185
It's a little Weird.

410
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,382
[scoffs]
OK, What do you Want me to do?

411
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,681
Because I'm not sticking around
here if it's not kosher.

412
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,093
I need you to help me
with my infomercial.

413
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:19,062
Infomercial? Of course, that
would have been my next guess.

414
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,068
So we have a deal?

415
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,938
Yeah, yeah, I think I can handle that.

416
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,008
Good.

417
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,544
We can talk about this further
when I get back from my shrink.

418
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,747
- Why do you Want to die again?
- Nice try.

419
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:46,452
So now you've actually got
your next hit living with you,

420
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,157
not to mention she's helping you
outwith your business.

421
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,296
- Of being an assassin.
- Yes, exactly.

422
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,928
But What does any of this
have to do with Bruce?

423
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,036
I Want to talk about Carla.

424
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,411
Randy. You're all over the place.

425
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:04,878
It's Detective Hult.

426
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,650
- This isn't making any sense.
- Then start making sense, Beatle.

427
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,948
It's up to you to make sense, not me.

428
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,884
I know my story.

429
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:17,790
I know my case. I've been working
on this for seven years now.

430
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:21,887
- So you start making sense.
- OK.

431
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,301
Tell me about
the last time you saw Carla.

432
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,502
[heavy breathing]

433
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,971
OK...

434
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:38,708
Alright, who are you and What
have you done with my favorite trick?

435
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:39,714
Huh?

436
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:44,209
Well, I don't knovv, I mean, you knovv,
it's like you're not here or something.

437
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,515
Is everything OK?

438
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,794
I don't knovv, that's What I was
sitting here trying to figure out.

439
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:55,854
Well, you are not only
just sitting here,

440
00:30:55,954 --> 00:31:00,425
you happen to be sitting here
with the most talented mouth

441
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,233
this side of the continental divide.

442
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:21,318
Jesus! Can you fucking pretend to have
some sexual etiquette or something?

443
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:22,720
Act like you're having fun.

444
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,525
Alright, look, you know...

445
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,901
Don't get it twisted
or anything because I...

446
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,806
I like you a lot, but you're still
going to have to pay me so...

447
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,577
You like me?

448
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,844
Sh... Sure.

449
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:56,019
- That's strange.
- [chuckles]

450
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,725
OK, <i>I'll</i> bite, why?

451
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:09,732
That's the, um... second time this week
that somebody's said that to me.

452
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,911
The first time was the first time.

453
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:21,674
- I don't understand.
- Ever. In my life.

454
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,481
Are you shitting me?

455
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,316
No.

456
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,583
Beatle.

457
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:40,135
What was your relationship
with Athena Glendon?

458
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,202
I really don't think
that that's any of your business.

459
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:48,209
Friends?

460
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,973
Maybe a little more than friends?

461
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,221
You know the bartender at St. Mary's

462
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,224
said you two
were getting a little cozy together.

463
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,360
<i>Really cozy together.</i>

464
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:15,302
It's very interesting kind of stuff
they have here at your bar.

465
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,932
Yeah.

466
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:22,406
It's you knovv, the local dive bar.

467
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,535
Right.

468
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,277
Well, cheers.

469
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,878
Cheers.

470
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,754
- You should do that more often.
- Hm?

471
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,282
Smile.

472
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,853
OK.

473
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,449
I'll try to do that more.

474
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:50,570
OK, Beatle Boyin.
Where, Where can you be?

475
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:04,777
I see London, I see France.

476
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,955
[rock music plays]

477
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:24,632
What time are you
out of here, sweetheart?

478
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,413
Two o'clock.

479
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,282
So have you ever
been in a relationship?

480
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,720
Yes. I have.

481
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,692
Well, I... l meant
a serious relationship.

482
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,955
Yes. Very serious.

483
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,463
Did it end badly with him or something?

484
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:51,591
- Her.
- Oh...

485
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:52,861
Um...

486
00:34:55,593 --> 00:35:00,508
She was into this whole subculture thing

487
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,578
that was happening in Portland
at the time and...

488
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:10,276
I just Wanted to make her happy.

489
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,450
What kind of subculture?

490
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,751
She liked to bite.

491
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,386
Oh, WOW.

492
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,528
- Well, was that a bad thing?
- With fangs.

493
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,603
- Oh, WOW.
- So... a little Weird.

494
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,536
Yeah. That's really Weird.

495
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:34,132
Kinda sounds like a really great
way to get AIDS, too.

496
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,677
Oh...

497
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,819
It's a bill for a blow job,
250 if you want to go all the way.

498
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,982
Anything else you Want to
incorporate is obviously extra.

499
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:54,387
Um... I'm as flexible as your wallet is.

500
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:58,433
So if you have any kinky shit you Want
to do just make sure you can pay for it.

501
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:06,800
So, What's it going to be?

502
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,008
You and me
need to have a little chit chat.

503
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:13,772

- So, Beatle.
- Hmm?

509
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,496
How are you going to kill me?

510
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:44,340
Um... I'm working on that.

511
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:47,507
- Oh.
- Yeah... I'll figure it out.

512
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:48,913

- Yeah.

- Well, let me know.
- OK.

514

I told you already. I don't know
who you're fucking talking about!

physical perfection is almost
a pre-requisite.

523
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,619
Would that be
a safe assumption to make?

What's that?

It's warm milk.

Isn't milk suppose to be cold?

553
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:44,588
Didn't your... didn't your mom
ever give you warm milk

554
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:45,854
when you were a kid?

555
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,665
I don't knovv,
I don't remember my mom.

No. Why?

No wonder I'm What?

561
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:16,083
You have to admit
that you're not exactly normal, Beatle.

I'm not one of the sheep.

563
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:22,692
Yeah, right, thank God.

an army of fucking robots.

Sad! I can't imagine living like that.

00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:38,907
Wait, Where do you get off telling me
What I'm like? You don't even know me.

567
00:40:39,003 --> 00:40:42,075
I don't need to know you, you're one
of them, that's all I need to know.

568
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,244
As opposed to What?
As opposed to being like you?

569
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:48,483
- I'll pass, thanks.
- No. As opposed to being yourself.

570
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,855
Try thinking for yourself for once.

571
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,360
I do think for myself,
thank you very much.

572
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,261
You think you do, but you don't,
that's the trap.

But What I need to do is...
a little something different right here.

00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,633
is there something
you'd like to say to me?

00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,941
Because now would be the time.

590
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,875
You know Where I found this little
psychotic book of horrors, Beatle?

591
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,082
No, I can't say that I do.

592
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:27,053
I found it in a box
with this camera in it. Your camera.

593
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,222
You knovv, if you don't
speak to me I can't help you.

594
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,888
Is that What you're doing here?
You're helping me?

595
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:37,591
Yeah, I'm trying to.

596
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:41,261
Whatever you think,
I'm not out to get you. OK?

597
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,563
In fact, I think
you and I are very similar.

598
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,272
[heavy breathing]

00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:54,582

[whistling]

601
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:10,594
Oh, good, you're up.

602
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:16,134
What's? I didn't know
I had all this food.

603
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,864
Oh, believe me, you didn't.

604
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:22,172
You... you had a can
of pork and beans, circa 1936

605
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,973
and a box of baking soda in the fridge.

606
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,229
And I gotta admit,
I was tempted by that pork and beans

607
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,743
because I'm pretty sure that can
showed all signs of botulism.

608
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:33,615
But then I realized as another benefit
connected with my new outlook on life.

609
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,021
I can eat whatever I want.
Isn't that fabulous?

610
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,559
So I kind of decided,
over the course of the next week.

611
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:41,061
I'm gonna try something new
every single day.

612
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:44,724
I am throwing caution to the wind
when it comes to calorie intake.

613
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,163
Sit, eat.
I made this for both of us.

614
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,165
- You did?
- Of course I did, sweetie.

615
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:54,072
I may not be counting calories,
but my stomach is only so big.

616
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,909
- What?
- Did you just call me sweetie?

617
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:02,747
Oh, so I did. Just came out.
I decided not to edit myself.

618
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:07,084
You're gonna get
a kick out of this, too.

619
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,816
I got all of these groceries for free.

620
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:12,223
Really, how'd you swing that one?

621
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,387
Flash the grocer
in the ten items or less aisle?

622
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,295
[gasps] No, but I'll remember that
for next time.

623
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:20,301
All I did was fill up my cart
and Walk out of the store.

624
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,234
About 15 people watched me do it, too.

625
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,466
It was like their brains couldn't
process that somebody would just.

626
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:28,796
Walk out of the store with a cart full
of groceries she didn't even pay for.

627
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,310
What... What's wrong, it's not good?

628
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:38,750
Uh, no I'm just not used to all this.

629
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:40,951
Used to What, honey?

630
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,886
Everything-

631
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,731
Nothing, nothing.

632
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:52,800
Eat.

633
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:56,763
Wow.

634
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,135
She really cared for you didn't she?

635
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,143
That must've felt good, right?

636
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:12,879
And now, she's cooking me breakfast,
she's calling me "baby" and "honey"

637
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:17,482
and "sweetie", and then,
last night, she hugged me.

638
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:20,528
I mean, it's all too much.

639
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,896
So, let me get this straight,

640
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,968
you came bursting into my office
claiming to have a serious emergency,

641
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,094
While just to go on and on
for the last half hour

642
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,571
about the fact that
another human being treated you kindly.

643
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,302
Thanks for the instant reply, doc.

644
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,641
Now I know you were paying attention,
but that does nothing to help me.

645
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,646
Help you with What?

646
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,911
You have a friend,
that's a good thing.

647
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:48,955
You're showing a range of emotions
that far exceed the neutral indifference

648
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:51,185
that you've exhibited for years.

649
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:57,492
You're making progress.
I don't see What the problem is.

650
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:00,093
She hired me to kill her.

651
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,364
Oh, shit, we are back to this again?

652
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,964
She did! I have to kill her
in less than a week.

653
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,735
Well, I guess you should enjoy it
While it lasts then.

654
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,171
It's hard for you to open up, isn't it?

655
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,576
Why do you think that is?

656
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:20,112
I don't think, I know.

657
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,295
Bruce, it's been two days,

658
00:46:29,386 --> 00:46:32,526
I don't think that I need
to tell you the amount of shit

659
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,627
that you will be in
if I don't get my delivery.

660
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,839
- Say, cheese!

[muffled screaming]

662
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:45,413
Let me explain to
you What's going to happen here.

663
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:50,716
I'm gonna very slowly peel
the toenail off your broken toe.

664
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,381
Which will undoubtedly
jar that injury a bit,

665
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:57,948
While at the same time,
creating an all together new wound.

666
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:03,097
See the pain is basically going to be
focused on one area of your body,

667
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:07,467
but it will be
two different torments, if you will.

668
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,839
What I Want you to do,
is I Want you to tell me

669
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:17,104
if you can feel both injuries at once or
you can only feel one thing at a time.

670
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:22,378
Okie dokie artichokie?
Alright, here we go.

671
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,551
What can I do for you today?

672
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,988
- Enjoying the view?
- Oh...

673
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:32,822
Oh, come on, don't let the fact
that I know What you're thinking

674
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,759
- stop you from thinking it.
- Ma'am?

675
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,332
[chuckles] You really going to
mentally fuck my brains out

676
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,662
- than refer to me as ma'am?
- I assure you...

677
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,736
- Are you Catholic?
- Sorry?

678
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:45,398
- Are you a Catholic?
- Uh, yeah, I suppose.

679
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:49,238
OK then do yourself a favor, Hugh.
Don't lie to me.

680
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:50,505
OK, I mean you've already got enough

681
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:52,842
pointless guilt to wrestle with already,
don't you think?

682
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:55,316
And if you finish that sentence,
you're just gonna be in confessional

683
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:57,043
a few minutes longer than necessary.

684
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,314
By the time you're done with all
your Hail Mary's and Our Father's,

685
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,823
that's like a good five minutes
you could've spent jerking off.

686
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:06,258
Any who, my friend gave me
a thousand bucks and told me

687
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:10,127
to find the best video camera I can.
Suggestions?

688
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,928
Shall we move on to the next foot now?

689
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:15,936
- [muffled screaming]
- [chuckles]

690
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,533
You trying to say something, man?

691
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:25,642
Ugh, Jesus. What you got?

692
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,550
- Her file is in the desk.
- In the desk.

693
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,321
As much as I'm enjoying
this psychological,

694
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:38,859
and somewhat entertaining,
side to this case.

695
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,419
I Want to focus
on this right here, Beatle. OK?

696
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:47,593
Because this right here is the evidence
that proves you're a killer.

697
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,701
You Want to start co-operating?

698
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:55,334
And remember, I'm not just the
spokesperson, I'm also a client.

699
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,605
And by the time
you see this infomercial,

700
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:01,171
Beatle Boyin will have yet
another satisfied customer.

701
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,216
Did you get it,
because I'm gonna be dead?

702
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,382
- Right.
- Right.

703
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:10,583
Well...

704
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:14,354
Beatle.

705
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,463
You're not thinking about
pussying out on me are you?

706
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:22,662
- No.
- No, because that would not be cool,

707
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:23,999
because we have a deal.

708
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:25,300
Yes, yes we have a deal.

709
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:26,874
So you're gonna hold up
your end of the bargain?

710
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,434
- Yes. Can we just move on, please?
- As long as We're clear.

711
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:34,949
Yes. We are clear,
I will kill you, you will be dead. OK?

712
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,918
Good, let's do it again.

713
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:45,889
I think its time for you to start
admitting how you felt about this girl.

714
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,964
Why do we keep on going back to Athena,
when this is supposed to be about

715
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,659
me being, What, the killer
of this guy named Bruce?

716
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,133
Because I need a motive.

717
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:58,570
Now, I think you killed Bruce
because he was on to Athena.

718
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:02,007
OK, so, I'm going to kill Athena.

719
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,139
<i>[woman on TV] How many times

What?

724
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,022
You have how much time left

725
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,253
and you're really gonna spend it
watching television?

726
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,453
I'm broke.

727
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,528
So?

728
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,863
So, unless you're offering
to take me out on a date

729
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:26,764
I don't really have any options.

730
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:32,603
You'd go out on a date with me?

731
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:35,305
What you mean?

732
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,439
If you approached me in a bar?

733
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:42,296
Yeah, if I approached you in a bar
and I asked you out, What would you say?

734
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,775
I'd probably say yes.

735
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:49,547
Really?

736
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:50,647
Yeah.

737
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:56,454
You got that sexy sort of
bad ass thing happening.

738
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:01,360
Wow. Who knew?

739
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:05,001
But of course I'd have to tell you
I have AIDS and you'd probably

740
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:09,168
retract the offer, so really, this
conversation is pointless, isn't it?

How am I doing so far?

747
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:18,004
Good. So far, so good.

748
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:23,742
This is my first date, so I kinda
Want to make sure I do it right.

749
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:29,489
Are you serious?
You've never been on a date before?

750

Never.

751
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:36,463
Wow. Being a Woman's first date.

752
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,960
I feel so privileged.

753
00:52:40,423 --> 00:52:44,838
Got to be something to be said for it,
not really sure What it is but...

754
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:52,210
- Does that mean you've never?
- What?

755
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,644
You know?

756
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,678
Oh, God, no. Of course I have.

757
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:59,879
Well, I don't knovv,
if you've never dated...

758
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:01,956
- I have a girl.
- Oh.

759
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:09,028
What does that mean you have a girl?
Are you... are you in a relationship?

760
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,723
Are you kidding?

761
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:14,131
She's a stripper,
we see each other once a week.

762
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:18,673
It's a mutually beneficial situation.

763
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:20,773
She's a hooker.

764
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,969
OK, that's one Way to put it.

765
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,948
OK, do you guys have one of
those weird relationships.

766
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,544
Where one or both of you
has feelings for the other one?

767
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:36,487
Why are we still talking about this,
it's really insignificant.

768
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,117
Because sometimes people
get really attached,

769
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,253
and it turns into this whole big thing.

770
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:44,332
Athena, I've never been attached
to anyone before in my life.

771
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:47,925
Before you I've never felt
anything for... anyone.

They have an excellent
tortilla soup here,

you should try it
if you've never had it.

774
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:05,918
Tortilla soup, it's good.
It sounds... good.

775
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,215
Good.

776
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:11,382
- Ah, excuse me.
- Uh-huh.

We'll see if we can't
change that, shall we?

785
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,209
Beatle, we have to go,
he'll kill us.

786
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,802
Now, now, Athena,
no one's going to get killed.

787
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,038
I'm just going to take you
both over to Kyle's

788
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:44,949
and see What happens after that.
Okie dokie?

789
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:49,079
- Hold it right there, don't move.
- Or What?

790
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:51,689
Huh? What you Want to do?

that'll get your attention.

Oh, really?

797
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:12,503
You haven't told her yet?
Did I let the cat out of the bag?

798
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:15,082
Shame on me.

799
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:16,979
Let go of her.

800
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:19,713
What do you suppose the chances are?

801
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,846
Of you actually hitting me
with that bullet.

802
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:24,983
Without accidentally hitting your
bestest friend

803
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,721
in the whole world here, in the process?

804
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:30,431
I said, let go of her.

805
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,501
You know What,
I'm feeling pretty fucking lucky,

806
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,194
I'm going to call your bluff.

- Stop it, let her go!

808
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,472
Make me.

809
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:42,270
Actually surprised you haven't heard
the story, it's a really good one.

810
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:43,935
One more step and I'll shoot you.

811
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,314
I guess I'll tell her
the story myself.

812
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:49,580
It goes a little
something like this.

813
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,619
Once upon a time,
there was this crazy cult.

814
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,484
- [gun shot]
- [screams]

815
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,523
The end.

816
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,252
Are you OK?

817
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,596
- Call the cops.
- Beatle What are you talking about?

818
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:07,099
- Call the cops!
- Beatle, you don't Want the cops here.

819
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,898
This is an apartment complex,
people notice things like gun shots,

820
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:12,166
- work with me here, please.
- OK.

821
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:19,475
[Beatle] I'm sorry.

822
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,712
I'm sorry.

823
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,416
It's OK.
I'm calling, I'm calling right now.

824
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:33,351
- [indistinct chatter]
- [sirens]

825
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,257
Thank you, Ms. Glendon.
We'll be in touch.

826
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:38,388
Thanks.

827
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:45,567
Well, as far as I can tell
this is an open and shut case.

00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:50,841
Trespassing, self defense,
What have you.

829
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,543
But I will need you
to stay in town until

830
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,411
the official investigation is over.

831
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,183
You understand? OK, great.

832
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,794
Here's my card. If you have any
questions, feel free to call me.

833

834
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:13,399
- You know... I don't understand...
- Please... don't, OK.

835
00:58:20,263 --> 00:58:23,107
You weren't expecting Kyle
to clear out Bruce's things

836
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,611
and put them in storage
for seven years, now were you?

837
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:29,547
Including your video camera
that he took from your towing office.

838
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:34,019
Which features a taped confession
about being an assassin.

839
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,181
So Where's the tape
showing me saying that?

840
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:38,816
You really think we don't have it? Hmm?

841
00:58:39,482 --> 00:58:42,520
Anyway, you think the tape
is going to make or break this case?

842
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,964
I mean look around you,
this file on its own!

843
00:58:46,055 --> 00:58:47,295
All fantasy.

844
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,927
And besides We've got you
taking payments for those hits.

845
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:55,370
This could be anyone.

846
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:58,935
But it's not, Beatle.
It's you, isn't it?

847
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,276
Now I've been
very patient here, alright?

848
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:04,910
But I'm starting to get very tired
with this conversation, Beatle.

849
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,078
Yeah, me too.

850
00:59:06,175 --> 00:59:09,418
Yeah? Why are you getting tired?

851
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:12,288
Because of the Way that
you have this story in your head.

852
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:17,822
You already have me tried and convicted,
and it feels like nothing I say

853
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:22,392
is going to convince you otherwise.
So... why should I bother?

854
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,203
Try me.

855
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:32,841
I think there's a chance that you
believe it's possible, just possible,

856
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:38,311
that things happened differently
then the Way you presented them here.

857
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:44,415
That there might be another explanation
for why things are the way they are.

858
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,530
[Beatle 96835]

859
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,700
[moaning in pain]

860
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,705
- Shh, shh.
- [moans louder]

861
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,071
Shh, it's OK.

862
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:42,240
It was a nightmare.
It's OK. It's OK.

863
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,555
Drink some of this.

864
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,997
[speaks indistinct]

865
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,914
Who's Ronda?

866
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:23,614
I have no idea.

867
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:27,792
What? I never heard of her.

868
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,895
You know What, if you're not
gonna be honest with me.

869
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:39,539
- What?
- Something reeks.

870
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,537
[sniffing]

871
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,313
I don't smell anything.

872
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,376
Are you kidding me?

873
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:53,949
[sniffing] No.

874
01:01:54,911 --> 01:01:56,913
OK, so I'll break out some Lysol.

875
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:58,094
Beatle, What are you doing?

876
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:01,162
You have to get whatever's clown there,
out of there. This is not pretty.

877
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,321
There is nothing clown there!

878
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:10,500
I'm sorry.

879
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:16,809
Alright, look,
it's Where I keep my money stashed.

880
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,475
Money doesn't smell like that.

881
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,969
Well, that's all it is, babe,
I don't know What too tell you.

882
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:26,249
Why do I feel like
I'm getting tricked around here?

883
01:02:26,342 --> 01:02:30,222
I don't knovv, you're not.
Jesus, paranoid much?

884
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,897
What's going on Beatle? Huh?

885
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:40,500
Who's Ronda?

886
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,229
What are you not telling me?

887
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:47,339
And What for the love of all
things holy is under the bed?

888
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,070
Fine.

889
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,311
No, get away from there.
Get away!

890
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:59,079
Get off of me. [Grunts]

891
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:01,781
Shit!
Get the fuck off of me, Beatle!

892
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:04,290
What's under the bed, huh?
What are you hiding? Huh?

893
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:05,723
- Business, Athena.
- Huh?

894
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:08,227
Get the... fuck off of me!

895
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,464
Oh...

896
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:13,426
You thought...

897
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,070
My shrink gave me that shit.

898
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,664
He thinks I have a problem,
but I don't. So can we drop this now?

899
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:23,778
Why would he think you have
a problem that you don't have?

900
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,040
I don't know! He also doesn't
think I'm an assassin.

901
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,775
But as you and I both knovv,
that's not true either.

902
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:33,715
I actually don't have any proof
that you're an assassin.

903
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:38,523
Um, you hired me too kill you, remember?

904
01:03:38,614 --> 01:03:41,060
And I am still
very much alive, aren't I?

905
01:03:43,853 --> 01:03:47,801
Fine, screw you, you Want to believe?

906
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,234
I don't need this shit from you,
if you Want to believe some asshole

907
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,846
you've never even met before, over me,

908
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:54,135
then there's nothing
I can do about it, is there?

909
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:57,473
And maybe you can go hide out from your
little Wannabe Tony Soprano fuck wad

910
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,069
at Dr. Vanderark's house.

911
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,079
Because I sure as fuck
don't Want you here.

912
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,241
You know What, Beatle? I'm just trying
to figure out who the fuck you are.

913
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:05,341
Well, go figure it out,
somewhere else.

914
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:06,476
Do you know What the books say?

915
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:07,850
Do you know
What these books say, Beatle?

916
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:10,390
These book say that you might be
acting out a fantasy life,

917
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:12,390
that you might not
even know you're doing it.

918
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,518
Please! What are you saying, sweetheart?

919
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,688
Are you calling me a liar, huh?

920
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:18,224
Or maybe I'm just an idiot

921
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:20,494
who's too retarded to tell the
difference between real life

922
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:22,433
and a fucking fantasy.

923
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:27,567
Or maybe, maybe, maybe you're just
plain calling me crazy'? Is that it'?

924
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,609
Do you think I'm fucking crazy?

925
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,407
Huh? Because that's a laugh
coming from you,

926
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:35,505
little miss, "I like to pretend
I'm a vampire and suck AIDS blood"

927
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:36,811
out of my girlfriends neck."

928
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:40,718
Yeah, that's fucking funny.
Yeah, I'm the fucking crazy one, here!

929
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:47,056
What's under your fucking bed, Beatle?

930
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:50,758
Money.

931
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:10,075
Show me. Show me, Beatle.

932
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:12,349
This isn't fucking money, Beatle.

933
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:14,443
This is fucking trash!

934
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:16,489
This is garbage, you see this?

935
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:19,287
Do you see that?
Come look! Show me!

936
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:20,759
- [screaming]
- Show me!

937
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,753
This is fucking garbage, Beatle. Look!

938
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:28,029
Look in there! Look! Huh?
Fucking trash!

939
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:29,933
Trash!

940
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,800
[sobbing]

941
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:33,896
Look at me.

942
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:41,578
You're not really an assassin, are you?

943
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:46,853
Say it. I Want to hear you say it.

944
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:50,356
I Want to hear you say,
"I'm not really an assassin."

945
01:05:52,982 --> 01:05:54,154
Beatle.

946
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:00,993
I don't even know your name.

947
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,064
[sniffles] Wait.

948
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:07,197
What?

949
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:13,013
Did you know last night,

950
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:16,746
last night I was actually
considering staying here with you.

951
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,218
For a minute, I...

952
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:22,522
I actually thought,
you knovv, what, this could be...

953
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,319
This could be
enough to change everything.

954
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:28,623
I could deal with a situation, I could.

955
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:31,525
But, obviously, you can't.

956
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:34,123
I'm not gonna sit around
and watch you live a lie,

957
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:36,260
it's just something I don't have
the time or energy to do,

958
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,965
for someone that Won't even
tell me her name. I'm sorry.

959
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:52,652
You're not an assassin?

960
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,150
No.

961
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:02,625
Who are you?

962
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:06,189
Who do you think I am?

963
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,869
[crying]

964
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,468
This is you?

965
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,344
Shh...

966
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:44,061
Who is this girl, Randy?

967
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:47,528
It's Detective Hult.

968
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,205
Who is this girl, Randy?

969
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:57,744
Detective Hult! Detective Hult!
Detective Hult! Detective Hult!

970
01:08:57,833 --> 01:08:58,971
Do you recognize the girl?

971
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:02,641
I've just taken down
one of the biggest criminal masterminds

972
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:08,381
in modern history, and I demand
a little respect from you now. OK?

973
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:11,718
I got him with all the evidence
I had and I'm going to get you

974
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:15,387
with the same evidence right here,
it's here, right in front of me.

975
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,565
Where's the tape?

976
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:27,202
- Where did you put the tape?
- There is no tape, Randy.

977
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,902
What do you mean there's no tape?
Where's the tape, it was right here.

978
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,706
There never was a tape, Randy.

979
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,077
There was a tape in there,
you stole it and that's another of fence.

980
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,946
There was never a tape.

981
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,093
Hello, Randy.

982
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:51,960
What are you... What are you doing here?
You can't be in here.

983
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:54,859
What's going on?
What are you doing in here?

984
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:56,436
- You can't be in here.
- I'm here to help.

985
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,095
No, Wait a minute who let you in?
You can't be in here.

986
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:01,573
I'm here to help, let's just talk.

987
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:03,905
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Just come-Sit clown.

988
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:06,878
- You can't be in here!
- It's OK, I just Want to help.

989
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,381
You can't even be in here.
You're gonna have to leave.

990
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:11,417
You two can't be
in the same room together.

991
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:12,747
Just gonna talk.

992
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:15,481
- You gotta leave.
- No, no. I'll just be a minute.

993
01:10:15,578 --> 01:10:16,556
It's OK.

994
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:19,685
Randy, why don't you just come over here
and have a conversation with us, OK?

995
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:23,388
I don't know What's going on here,
I don't know why they let you in here.

996
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:26,565
- Randy, We're your doctors.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

997
01:10:26,655 --> 01:10:28,726
We're your doctors,
and We're here to help you.

998
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:32,269
What the fuck are you talking about?

999
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,736
I'm a cop.

1000
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,979
I'm a cop and I keep people safe.
That's What I do.

1001
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,848
I protect people, OK?

1002
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,152
And I make sure no body dies.

1003
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,447
Like Kyle Sullivan.

1004
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,418
The drunk driver
that killed your family.

1005
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:54,255
- What are you talking about?
- That you murdered.

1006
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,853
- I'm not a murderer.
- Because he killed your Wife.

1007
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,622
Carla.

1008
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:02,764
And your daughter.

1009
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:06,667
Remember that?

1010
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:10,336
I'm a detective.
I don't kill people.

1011
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:12,770
It's true.

1012
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:23,080
This is your wife, Carla.

1013
01:11:23,479 --> 01:11:26,653
She and your daughter were killed
when Kyle Sullivan crashed into

1014
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:28,854
your car While driving drunk.

1015
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:33,160
This is insane.

1016
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:44,700
I don't know who this is in this
picture, but it's not me, Randy.

1017
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,940
I'm your doctor. I'm Dr. Richards.

1018
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,780
We are both your doctors.

1019
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,315
You're Beatle.

1020
01:11:57,613 --> 01:12:01,823
No. Beatle is a part
of yourself that's a murderer.

1021
01:12:04,753 --> 01:12:06,164
You're Athena Glendon.

1022
01:12:06,255 --> 01:12:10,795
No. I'm not Athena Glendon.
I'm Dr. Sharlett Lyn, I'm your doctor.

1023
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:14,033
And that picture is...
it's from my ID card.

1024
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:15,937
You see that?

1025
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:21,404
Athena, is the part of yourself
that wants to die.

1026
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:31,186
This is you, Randy.

1027
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,124
And this is your wife, Carla.

1028
01:12:35,584 --> 01:12:39,396
And this... is your daughter.

1029
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:41,024
Ronda.

1030
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:03,789
I don't understand anything.

1031
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:07,823
It's OK.

1032
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,160
I'm a cop.

1033
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:15,701
No, Randy you're not a cop,
you're an engineer.

1034
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,938
And this is your family.

1035
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,937
- They're my family?
- Yeah.

1036
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,278
- It's OK, Randy.
- Why do I not remember this?

1037
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:37,454
We're here to help.

1038
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:40,286
You just have to trust us.

1039
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:53,303
[crying]

1040
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,471
You guys are good.

1041
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:34,843
Really good.

1042
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:39,147
But I know the truth.

1043
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:44,549
I'm not gonna stop
until everybody else does.

1044
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,589
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave,
Ms. Glendon.

1045
01:14:51,587 --> 01:14:53,828
I'm in the middle
of a police investigation,

1046
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:55,367
and this is an interrogation room,

1047
01:14:55,457 --> 01:14:58,267
and you two can not be in here
at the same time.

1048
01:14:59,828 --> 01:15:01,068
So if you don't mind?

1049
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:04,643
[door opens]

1050
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:08,738
OK, detective.
Can I borrow you for a moment?

1051
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:13,175
It's OK. Go ahead.

1052
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:14,652
I'll Wait for you.

1053
01:15:17,946 --> 01:15:20,654
- We'll finish this later.
- OK.

1054
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:22,655
OK.

1055
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:34,637
It's been a long day today.

1056
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:36,539
Next time, OK?

1057
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:40,305
- We'll get there.
- Yeah, we will.

1058
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:43,715
Good job, detective.

1059
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:45,341
What do you got, detective?

1060
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,887
We were close.

1061
01:15:55,617 --> 01:16:00,191
- Maybe next week.
- Yes. Maybe next week.

1062
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:03,933
Where do you think he gets
this crazy idea

1063
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:06,131
that Beatle and Athena are together?

1064
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:12,237
Seems, um, pretty consistent
in the story don't you think?

1065
01:16:13,535 --> 01:16:17,483
- It's always my favorite part.
- Mmm. You should do that more.

1066
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:21,945
Yeah, come on, let's go home.
Come on! Cheer up.

1067
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,057
After you.

1068
