00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:17,348
look around you.

182
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:21,459
see those guys...

183
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,651
...they're dangerous.

184
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:25,521
they'll do anything for us.

185
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:27,992
anytime. anywhere. to anyone.

186
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:30,098
y eah, those guys are hungry...

187
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,769
...especially max.

188
00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:36,808
now, you must help me
feed those guys.

189
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,875
talk to me.

190
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:46,450
anything l have is yours.

191
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:48,516
my house is yours,
my bitch is yours...

192
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:50,814
...but not my wife.

193
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,461
y ou showed me the game.

194
00:20:58,697 --> 00:21:00,289
y ou know the fellas have to eat.

195
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:04,628
lf they don't, they'll turn around
and eat our food.

196
00:21:06,004 --> 00:21:08,666
l don't know jamaica like that.

197
00:21:09,074 --> 00:21:11,668
and l don't know these cats like that.

198
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:13,902
see what l'm saying?

199
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:20,482
lt's been 20 years since l've been back
to this motherfucker, yo.

200
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:22,415
l'm out of my comfort zone.

201
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:29,318
jamaica is a cakewalk.
l saw you lock down miami.

202
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:32,428
what happened to you?
fuck jamaica.

203
00:21:33,398 --> 00:21:35,491
we have the manpower...

204
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:38,031
...and the guns too.

205
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:44,672
l had millions of dollars
in america...

206
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,676
...before l went to prison.

207
00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:55,819
l lived the best life
there was to live...

208
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:59,451
...and l want it back.

209
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:03,354
and little jamaica
can't do that for me.

210
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:09,431
y ou don't understand.

211
00:22:12,771 --> 00:22:16,730
did you see all those houses
we drove past on the way up here?

212
00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:21,845
all the people, shops and stores...

213
00:22:22,047 --> 00:22:26,609
...they give me a little something
to live comfortably.

214
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:31,146
a little something, huh?

215
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:34,220
protection.

216
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:36,984
y ou know, we're more effective
than the police.

217
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:42,931
-sounds like extortion.
-so you call it.

218
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:45,934
nigga, that's what it is.
what the fuck you talking about?

219
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:48,606
l call it capitalism.

220
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:51,605
around here,
they understand the program.

221
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,142
they kicked us out of america.

222
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:55,573
this is where we are now.

223
00:22:55,781 --> 00:22:58,579
what are we gonna do,
lay down...

224
00:22:58,784 --> 00:23:02,117
...so people can call us
worthless deportee boys?

225
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,185
l don't even like that word,
''deportee.''

226
00:23:04,389 --> 00:23:08,086
lf a motherfucker calls me a deportee,
l'll empty my gun in his fucking face.

227
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:10,294
y eah. definitely.

228
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:16,464
lt's been four years
since l got deported.

229
00:23:16,668 --> 00:23:20,035
l came back home just like you,
with nothing.

230
00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:23,933
but l realized l had to
step up the game.

231
00:23:24,176 --> 00:23:25,768
y eah. for real.

232
00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:28,343
take america out of your mind.

233
00:23:29,014 --> 00:23:31,482
right now, we have
everything here in jamaica.

234
00:23:31,716 --> 00:23:34,810
even politicians are in our pockets.

235
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:50,496
hello, baby.

236
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:52,394
hello.

237
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:55,199
let me talk to the big man.

238
00:23:57,943 --> 00:24:00,377
-like your hair.
-hello, mr. chin?

239
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:03,878
okay, sir. there's some men
at the front.

240
00:24:04,983 --> 00:24:07,713
-he'll be with you. he's coming, okay?
-all right.

241
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:12,580
what's up, mr. chin?
are you ready for me?

242
00:24:12,824 --> 00:24:15,156
l told you, man, one more week.

243
00:24:15,527 --> 00:24:17,324
me no have it yet.

244
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:19,053
come back and see me.

245
00:24:19,598 --> 00:24:21,190
y ou think l have time to waste?

246
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:24,368
-trying to beat the system, mr. chin?
-no, not at all.

247
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:26,537
but you and l have an agreement.

248
00:24:26,705 --> 00:24:29,401
y eah, and you're not keeping
your end of the bargain.

249
00:24:29,608 --> 00:24:32,202
so, max, do him.

250
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:54,193
ls this how y'all living?

251
00:24:57,802 --> 00:24:59,599
man, fuck the chinese boy.

252
00:24:59,804 --> 00:25:01,396
he hasn't paid for three months.

253
00:25:01,606 --> 00:25:03,870
what does he think this is, a game?

254
00:25:04,109 --> 00:25:06,771
no, motherfucker.
this is the real thing.

255
00:25:07,012 --> 00:25:11,711
y o, l'm just saying though,
what the fuck was that?

256
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:38,802
where you from?

257
00:25:40,578 --> 00:25:42,170
miami.

258
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:44,979
where in miami are you from?

259
00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:47,975
y ou ask too many questions.

260
00:25:48,253 --> 00:25:50,744
he's the big man. he runs miami.

261
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:52,786
just take care of him.

262
00:25:54,192 --> 00:25:57,161
l'll be back. l'm going to the bathroom.
order more champagne.

263
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:41,731
faggot, remember me?

264
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:43,897
remember you from where?
l don't know you.

265
00:26:44,142 --> 00:26:45,234
shoot the motherfucker.

266
00:26:45,477 --> 00:26:48,742
-die. y ou're gonna die.
-shoot the motherfucker.

267
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:36,352
-get off the bike!
-police!

268
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,066
motherfuckers must die!

269
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:08,119
big move.

270
00:28:08,293 --> 00:28:09,783
big move for who?

271
00:28:13,631 --> 00:28:15,792
checkmate in two more turns.

272
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,560
-hello.
-a full four more.

273
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:22,133
how you learn to play this game?

274
00:28:26,644 --> 00:28:27,702
say what?

275
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,521
not a talking game,
it's a killing game.

276
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:49,433
who called?

277
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:51,826
mad max.

278
00:28:54,172 --> 00:28:56,037
he said....

279
00:28:58,676 --> 00:29:01,144
he said they just killed blacka.

280
00:29:03,882 --> 00:29:05,679
who just killed my little brother?

281
00:29:05,884 --> 00:29:08,978
he said laing and his friends.

282
00:29:09,254 --> 00:29:13,156
that police boy, laing, he must die!

283
00:29:20,365 --> 00:29:21,855
hello.

284
00:29:23,368 --> 00:29:24,892
let me speak to mr. anderson.

285
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:33,841
mr. anderson,
wayne is on the phone for you.

286
00:29:41,853 --> 00:29:44,321
wayne, what's happening?
how is everything?

287
00:29:44,489 --> 00:29:45,581
not so good, sir.

288
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,314
what happened now, wayne?

289
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:49,516
y our boys getting out of control?

290
00:29:49,727 --> 00:29:51,661
the only person
out of control is laing.

291
00:29:51,863 --> 00:29:54,388
laing is an officer of the law.

292
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:57,727
and if your boys won't listen,
there is very little l can do.

293
00:29:57,936 --> 00:30:01,337
but he knew that was my little brother.
he didn't have to kill him.

294
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:04,997
the chinese businesspeople knew
blacka and mad max were behind...

295
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,077
-...their colleague's murder.
-they didn't have to kill him.

296
00:30:08,313 --> 00:30:11,373
when things get like that,
it's out of my hands.

297
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:14,242
wayne...

298
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:17,252
...you need to come to my office
and see me.

299
00:30:27,765 --> 00:30:30,632
blacka threw his life away.

300
00:30:30,935 --> 00:30:33,199
blacka knew what was going on.

301
00:30:33,438 --> 00:30:36,566
he should have been
right here with us.

302
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,975
too much showing off, dog.

303
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:41,540
l hear you, biggs.

304
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:44,839
but laing has wanted to kill someone
in my crew for a long time.

305
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:46,744
he never liked me!

306
00:30:48,987 --> 00:30:50,921
gangster, don't you see
that's natural...

307
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:53,057
...police and thieves.

308
00:30:54,993 --> 00:30:58,656
the politician, mr. anderson,
wants me to come see him.

309
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:01,722
let me tell you something.

310
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,634
police, politicians...

311
00:31:06,804 --> 00:31:10,604
...l don't trust any of them!

312
00:31:10,808 --> 00:31:12,742
remember that.

313
00:31:14,178 --> 00:31:20,413
l'm still gonna listen
to what he has to say.

314
00:31:35,533 --> 00:31:37,694
mr. anderson, mr. anderson.

315
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:39,834
wayne.

316
00:31:40,004 --> 00:31:42,097
how you doing, friend?

317
00:31:42,907 --> 00:31:45,171
have a seat, gentlemen.

318
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,944
mr. andy, this is my friend biggs.

319
00:31:48,146 --> 00:31:50,546
y ou already know john john.

320
00:31:53,818 --> 00:31:57,652
so, what can l do
to cool things down?

321
00:31:57,855 --> 00:32:01,291
l don't want you and officer laing
going at it, you know.

322
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:04,486
lt's him. he needs to chill.

323
00:32:04,696 --> 00:32:05,788
he needs to back off.

324
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:09,431
he knew blacka was my little brother.
he didn't have to kill him.

325
00:32:09,634 --> 00:32:11,295
listen to yourself.

326
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:13,334
l'm really sorry about your brother...

327
00:32:14,138 --> 00:32:17,471
...but he was like a mad dog
running wild.

328
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:20,640
mr. andy, that was my little brother.

329
00:32:20,878 --> 00:32:23,506
furthermore, laing wants
to stop our livelihood...

330
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:25,512
...and that's not gonna happen.

331
00:32:25,717 --> 00:32:28,049
wayne, election is coming up...

332
00:32:28,486 --> 00:32:31,250
...and l cannot afford to have
any unnecessary wrongs...

333
00:32:31,456 --> 00:32:33,219
...in my constituency.

334
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:36,393
y ou're going to have to
work with me, wayne.

335
00:32:38,229 --> 00:32:40,720
so, what do you want me
to do for you now, sir?

336
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:46,466
as you know, l have a very good
connection at the embassy.

337
00:32:47,071 --> 00:32:49,767
l need you to leave jamaica.

338
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:52,073
l'll get you and your friends
the visa.

339
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,101
and you leave the island
and go cool out for a while.

340
00:32:55,346 --> 00:32:59,442
because l can't take the heat
that is about to come down on me.

341
00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:02,848
l have a whole community
depending on me.

342
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:09,917
mr. andy, l respect you,
but l'm not leaving jamaica.

343
00:33:10,128 --> 00:33:14,497
things are good for me
right now in jamaica.

344
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:16,030
wayne...

345
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,567
...there is nothing else on the table.

346
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,567
nothing else on the table?

347
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:28,234
y ou're telling me that
you can't tell laing to back off?

348
00:33:28,513 --> 00:33:30,208
y ou can't tell him to step aside?

349
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:32,076
wayne, don't put me in a spot.

350
00:33:33,017 --> 00:33:35,417
mr. andy, l feel like
you're not trying to hear me.

351
00:33:35,586 --> 00:33:37,417
y ou're not trying to
see things my way.

352
00:33:37,588 --> 00:33:39,920
furthermore, l feel like
you're disrespecting me.

353
00:33:40,124 --> 00:33:42,752
so you know what?

00:33:47,298 --> 00:33:48,560
wayne.

357
00:33:57,575 --> 00:33:59,634
detective laing...

358
00:34:00,144 --> 00:34:03,602
...this is patrick anderson, mp.

359
00:34:03,915 --> 00:34:05,780

360
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,079
detective...

361
00:34:08,252 --> 00:34:10,686
...we both have a common problem.

362
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:13,482

y ou're familiar with him...

364
00:34:15,993 --> 00:34:17,756
...you killed his brother.

365
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:20,159
and now it's his turn.

366
00:34:20,798 --> 00:34:25,428
y ou can find him at waterhouse,

367
00:34:26,471 --> 00:34:28,098
and, detective...

368
00:34:28,473 --> 00:34:33,672
...just make sure that this problem

369
00:34:36,314 --> 00:34:38,077

00:35:10,147 --> 00:35:11,375

376
00:36:04,435 --> 00:36:08,929
that's not going to benefit us,
wayne.

377
00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:14,567
we have to leave this alone
or we're gonna end up dead!

378
00:36:14,979 --> 00:36:16,469
miami is where we need to be...

379
00:36:16,747 --> 00:36:20,308
...to start robbing some of those
bigtime drug dealers.

380
00:36:21,552 --> 00:36:24,988
gangsters don't rob 9-to-5 people
and poor people. y ou know that.

381
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:29,256
america is where we need to be.

00:36:59,724 --> 00:37:01,351
detective laing.

all day...

393
00:37:03,728 --> 00:37:09,257
...and none of those seven bodies is

00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:15,767

00:37:19,944 --> 00:37:23,675
wayne, you know that this is
a big misunderstanding.

399
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:25,348
we can talk, you know, friend.

400
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:28,485
we don't have a motherfucking
thing to talk about.

401
00:37:28,653 --> 00:37:31,679
after you and your police friends
tried to kill me last night...

402
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:33,720
...they murdered
seven of my friends...

403
00:37:33,891 --> 00:37:35,984
...seven men who killed

405
00:37:38,896 --> 00:37:41,296
the only fucking things talking
will be our guns!

00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:44,332
what about that visa thing
l told you about?

407
00:37:44,635 --> 00:37:46,364
that deal still stands, you know.

y ou have 48 hours.

409
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:50,466

00:37:54,979 --> 00:37:58,073

take care of it myself.

412
00:37:58,315 --> 00:38:00,306

413
00:38:00,518 --> 00:38:03,180

415
00:38:06,557 --> 00:38:08,582
...and outside your office too.

416
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,897
wayne, you got my word on it.

00:38:14,098 --> 00:38:16,225

419
00:38:21,072 --> 00:38:22,369

704
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:15,260
he should be nervous...

705
01:02:15,438 --> 01:02:19,101
...because we know

706
01:02:19,275 --> 01:02:23,473
he needs some bullets in his ass.

707
01:02:25,515 --> 01:02:27,847
-what's today?

716
01:03:27,443 --> 01:03:31,106
-this is like taking candy from a baby.

about banana boats.

793
01:10:53,856 --> 01:10:55,983

l'll tell you anyway, motherfucker.

796
01:11:02,464 --> 01:11:06,525
so listen, right, it was this white man,
black man and chinese man, right?

797
01:11:06,702 --> 01:11:10,194
and one day the king invited them
in his backyard and he was like:

798
01:11:10,372 --> 01:11:12,499
''hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

799
01:11:12,675 --> 01:11:15,143
whoever could swim past
this swimming pool...

800
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:17,676
...l'll give my daughter to you.''

801
01:11:17,846 --> 01:11:19,313
there was one goddamn problem:

802
01:11:19,481 --> 01:11:22,143
motherfucker had 20 sharks
in his swimming pool, right?

803
01:11:22,317 --> 01:11:26,720
but you know the chinaman. the
chinaman not fear no fucking thing.

804
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:31,487
shark looked at that chinese
motherfucker and ate him up, man.

805
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:33,423
so then the white boy
jumped in next.

806
01:11:33,595 --> 01:11:36,086
y ou know white people,
they always trying to reason.

807
01:11:36,298 --> 01:11:38,664
hold on, hold on, hold on.

808
01:11:38,834 --> 01:11:40,529
y eah, hello?

809
01:11:46,442 --> 01:11:49,843
forget about the white boy, right?
so the black man was in front...

810
01:11:50,012 --> 01:11:52,446
...of the swimming pool.
next thing you know:

811
01:11:53,348 --> 01:11:57,216
and now the black man's
on the other side like this:

812
01:11:57,386 --> 01:11:59,377
so the king come over
and the king's like:

813
01:11:59,555 --> 01:12:02,422
''what is it that you want, my son?
l'll give you anything.''

814
01:12:02,591 --> 01:12:05,321
the black man look at the king
and he said:

815
01:12:06,562 --> 01:12:12,432

in the motherfucking pool!

816
01:12:39,928 --> 01:12:41,919

824
01:13:12,928 --> 01:13:15,158
-later.
-where are you going?

825
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:18,424

826
01:13:25,207 --> 01:13:27,334

827
01:14:44,086 --> 01:14:46,384

828
01:14:46,555 --> 01:14:48,580
l want him dead.

829
01:14:48,757 --> 01:14:55,754
l want every fucking thing

830
01:14:56,999 --> 01:14:59,229

01:15:00,569 --> 01:15:05,006
first thing in the morning,

832
01:15:27,262 --> 01:15:30,629
they have 90 seconds
to go in and out.

833
01:15:30,799 --> 01:15:33,962
lf they don't get it done
in 90 seconds...

834
01:15:34,136 --> 01:15:36,798
...kill every fucking one of them.

835
01:16:15,344 --> 01:16:17,073
what's going on?

836
01:16:20,215 --> 01:16:22,775
what's really going on?

837
01:16:22,951 --> 01:16:24,646
just touching base.

838
01:16:26,722 --> 01:16:29,190
l think we need to kick back a little.

839
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:33,018
kick back? l don't understand.

840
01:16:35,197 --> 01:16:37,791
we need to cool out.

841
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:45,166
we have enough money to relax.

842
01:16:47,042 --> 01:16:51,001
l think the air conditioning is set
too high. y ou're getting cold feet.

843
01:16:53,115 --> 01:16:55,879
l never get cold feet.

844
01:16:56,218 --> 01:16:59,346
lately, l've been getting a vibe.

845
01:17:00,522 --> 01:17:04,390
we need to stop robbing.

846
01:17:05,894 --> 01:17:10,422
but l just got some information
about a rasta man...

847
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,198

01:17:18,373 --> 01:17:22,776

lt's a nice place.

853
01:17:37,559 --> 01:17:42,587
