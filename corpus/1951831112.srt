1
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:44,260
<i>It may look like just another
perfect day in sunny Kuala Lumpur Malaysia</i>

2
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,505
<i>but it's not</i>

3
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:56,070
<i>Because at San Francisco University,
a young woman has her college interview</i>

4
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,773
<i>Today is the first day
of the rest ofher life</i>

5
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:05,092
<i>And while she may look like
just another carefree college applicant-</i>

6
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,284
<i>She's not</i>

7
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:15,055
Excuse me.

8
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:18,094
Do you know where the admissions office is?
- Left at the fire hydrant.

9
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:20,225
Follow the path inside.
First floor.

10
00:01:20,325 --> 00:01:23,063
Thank you.
You're a lifesaver.

11
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:25,709
Okay, that was weird.

12
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,701
<i>She's Maya Dolittle</i>

13
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:34,749
<i>And she can talk to animals
I mean, how cool is that?</i>

14
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,625
Hi. I have a 9:00 appointment with
Admissions. Uh, it's Maya Dolittle.

15
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:53,702
Dolittle. Maya Dolittle.

16
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,034
As in Dr. Dolittle?

17
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:01,071
As in the great
Dr. Dolittle?

18
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,135
He's my dad.
- Yo, Frank.

19
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:08,206
Come here, man. Check this out.
This is Dolittle's kid.

20
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:10,476
<i>The guy who
single-handedly</i>

21
00:02:10,576 --> 00:02:12,611
saved that herd
of Sumatran rhinos?

22
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,680
Yeah, that's him.
That's my dad.

23
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:20,251
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. I totally love Dr. "D."

24
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:24,260
My cat, Mr. Smushy, and I have moved to
a whole new level in our relationship...

25
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,027
and it's totally because of
his article, "Feeling Feline."

26
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:31,049
Uh, I guess I
missed that one.

27
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,633
Guys, I'm kinda
late here. Admissions?

28
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:38,006
Oh, uh, down the hall
to the right.

29
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:40,009
Okay, thank you.
- No problem.

30
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:42,027
Bye.
- Bye.

31
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,189
Bye. - Dolittle's
kid. - Wow.

32
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,494
Hi.
- Good morning.

33
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,893
Okay, Maya. Come
on. You can do this.

34
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:02,431
You are confident
and capable.

35
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:07,032
You will be as good a
veterinarian as your dad... someday.

36
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:10,851
Okay, smile therapy.

37
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,348
Okay.

38
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:22,250
Hello, Maya. My name is Doris Park Weaver-
- Hello.

39
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,222
Dean of Admissions for San Francisco
University's Center for Veterinary Medicine.

40
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,591
Oh. It's nice to meet you.
- Oh, it is so nice to meet you.

41
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,595
Your father's been an invaluable resource
to this institution.

42
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:35,064
Oh, thank you.

43
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:37,898
I saw him lecture once.
A most impressive man.

44
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:39,902
Yeah, he's lectured me
many times.

45
00:03:40,002 --> 00:03:42,236
I mean, he's quite the lecturer.

46
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:44,937
This is our admissions committee.
They wanted to meet you in person.

47
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:49,209
Oh.
- Your father's thesis on anxiety disorders...

48
00:03:49,308 --> 00:03:51,545
in anubis baboons
was brilliant.

49
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:54,646
Brilliant. Will you continue his
research on wombat mating habits?

50
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:57,620
He's done so much
for the keel-billed Toucan.

51
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,989
So much.
- You must be eager to follow in his footsteps.

52
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:02,891
What's the title
of his next book?

53
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,293
Do you think he'd sign a copy for me?
- Um, yes.

54
00:04:05,393 --> 00:04:07,994
I'm not sure.
And okay, why not?

55
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:10,499
All righty then...

56
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,915
let's have a look at
your transcripts, shall we?

57
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,906
<i>Now then, uh</i>

58
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:22,277
it appears your grades
are, uh-

59
00:04:22,376 --> 00:04:25,180
Okay.

60
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,118
Yes, well, um, my emphasis
in the past year...

61
00:04:29,217 --> 00:04:33,853
has been more on... social aspects
of maturation versus academics...

62
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:37,860
in the hopes to broaden
my... curriculum vitae.

63
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,527
Ah. What about
extracurricular activities?

64
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:44,196
Perhaps you've joined your father
on one of his expeditions.

65
00:04:44,296 --> 00:04:48,603
<i>I read about his latest trip up the Amazon
in Invertebrates Illustrated</i>

66
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:51,304
Inspiring, truly.
- Mmm.

67
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:54,690
Well, I was on the homecoming
committee last year.

68
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:03,150
And it's a lot more
demanding than it sounds.

69
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,850
Yeah.

70
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,838
Well, let's look at your S.A.T. Scores.
- Right.

71
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:11,727
Uh-

72
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:15,529
<i>I've never been that great
in classroom situations</i>

73
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:18,332
I find that I do better
in a real-worid environment.

74
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:22,718
Perfect. We'd love to see you in action.
- In action?

75
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,908
This is the clinic nursery.

76
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:29,007
The committee and I
will observe you...

77
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:32,014
<i>to see how you interact
with the animals</i>

78
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:35,397
<i>Great Riece of cake</i>

79
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,052
You just go ahead and kick back
and leave the babies to me.

80
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:42,130
Yeah,
all righty then.

81
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,194
Smile therapy.

82
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:49,544
Listen. Listen up,
you guys. Come here.

83
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,231
<i>Look, this is very,
very important</i>

84
00:05:54,331 --> 00:05:58,269
My interview didn't go so well just now,
so I really need to impress them here.

85
00:05:58,368 --> 00:06:03,043
<i>So if you guys would just cooperate, that
would be greatly appreciated, okay?</i>

86
00:06:03,143 --> 00:06:07,178
Okay, awesome. Um-

87
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:11,225
So, boys and giris, what would
we like to play today?

88
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,035
How about we sing a song?

89
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,644
Oh! Hello there,
little goat.

90
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,965
Uh, yes, I know that is
a sound a goat makes.

91
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:29,715
But you don't have to do that with me
because I can talk to animals.

92
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,642
She wants her bottle.
- Oh. Um, okay, yeah.

93
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:38,147
Uh, "bah-bah." I knew that.

94
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:41,279
Uh, okay. Um-

95
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:43,961
You wanna drink your bottle?
Come on. Here you go.

96
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:50,706
Hey! Over here, everyone!
Harvey's hatched! Harvey's hatched!

97
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:55,708
Oh!

98
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,835
Welcome to the worid, baby chick.
- Mama?

99
00:06:59,935 --> 00:07:02,771
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not your mama.

100
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,276
Mama. Mama. Mama.
- Wha-

101
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:11,747
Oh, don't cry, little kitty.

102
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:15,380
You're my mew-mew.
- Your "mew-mew"? What is that?

103
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,117
<i>She thinks you're her mom.
- Hey, Mom Hey, Mom</i>

104
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:21,157
Guess what. Guess what. Guess what. Guess what.
- What?

105
00:07:21,256 --> 00:07:25,336
They all think you're their mom.
- I'm comin', Mama. Geronimo!

106
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:30,461
Excuse me. Sorry.

107
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,267
I got him.
I saved him.

108
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:39,404
Hey, Mom, you got any treats in here?
- Hey, wait! That's my purse!

109
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:42,006
Guess what. Guess what.
Guess what. Guess what.

110
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:44,642
<i>Bag, man
Where's all the good stuff?</i>

111
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:48,746
<i>Give me the- Look!
- Run for it!</i>

112
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:52,316
<i>This is fun!
- Told you you couldn't keep us locked down.</i>

113
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:56,136
<i>If you guys don't all stop this behavior,
you're all going to be on time-out!</i>

114
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:04,500
<i>Guess what. Guess what. Guess what.
- What? What? What?</i>

115
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,280
That's what.

116
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,912
<i>Mom!
- I'm in the kitchen</i>

117
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:22,092
So, how'd it go? How'd it go?
- Don't ask.

118
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,365
So, uh, I'm guessing a game
of fetch is out of the question?

119
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,789
So, how'd it go?
- I blew it.

120
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:34,926
They wait-listed me. And they said
that was only because "I'm a Dolittle."

121
00:08:35,026 --> 00:08:37,399
Oh, Maya,
so sorry.

122
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:41,837
Unless I can come up with a way to impress
the committee within the next four weeks...

123
00:08:41,936 --> 00:08:44,570
they suggest that I find
other alternatives to S.F.U.

124
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,638
I don't know what I was thinking.
I am not cut out for vet school.

125
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:49,842
Oh, don't be so hard
on yourself, Maya.

126
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:52,280
You have so much
natural talent.

127
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,346
It's gonna take some time
for you to develop it.

128
00:08:55,445 --> 00:08:57,982
But what if I can't?

129
00:08:58,082 --> 00:09:01,754
You're only 8.
Have faith, little one.

130
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:05,458
You are gonna find your own way
of doing things. I promise.

131
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:09,561
Ain't ya? Yeah?
- Yeah.

132
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,311
Yeah. There you go.

133
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,141
<i>You guys, my life is over</i>

134
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,876
<i>Les femmes,
always so dramatic.</i>

135
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:27,349
Talk to me after you've had your butt sniffed
by a Great Dane in a public park.

136
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:32,017
Now that's hard to live down.
- You guys, I'm serious.

137
00:09:32,116 --> 00:09:35,754
I have four weeks to impress the admissions
committee, and I have no idea how to do it.

138
00:09:35,854 --> 00:09:39,227
<i>Did you try dropping my name?
Everyone loves Monkey</i>

139
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,730
I am- how you say-
the breakout character.

140
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,065
How 'bout I get stuck down a well
like on one of those TV shows?

141
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:47,069
It'll be a huge story
and we'll get famous.

142
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,884
Oh! I wonder if they'll get Lassie
to play me in the movie.

143
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,642
<i>Sacre bleu!
It's animal control!</i>

144
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:01,666
Quick, hide!

145
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,601
The monkey has left
the building.

146
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,861
<i>Don't look now,
but he's heading your way</i>

147
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:20,700
<i>I'll get it.</i>

148
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,901
Mmm, he's young, handsome,
winning smile.

149
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:26,639
You better get downstairs and
make a fool of yourself right away.

150
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:30,078
Hello.
- Hi. Mrs. Dolittle?

151
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:33,548
Yes?
- My name is Cole Fletcher. I'm an aide at the White House.

152
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:35,883
<i>This gentleman is
with the Secret Service</i>

153
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:38,887
We're here on behalf of the
president of the United States.

154
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:41,337
Oh, well, come in.

155
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,795
What can I do
for you gentlemen?

156
00:10:51,895 --> 00:10:54,803
The president has asked to see Dr. Dolittle
at the White House right away.

157
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:57,238
The President?
- The White House?

158
00:10:57,338 --> 00:10:59,674
Is he here?

159
00:10:59,774 --> 00:11:02,177
I'm sorry. Uh...

160
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:06,209
he's in Antarctica saving
a pod of bowhead whales.

161
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:10,151
Can it wait a few weeks until he comes back?
- I'm afraid not.

162
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:13,020
It's an urgent matter, and no one else
is equipped to handle the situation.

163
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:15,057
He needs someone
who can talk to animals.

164
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:18,026
Well, I wish there was something
I could do to help, but-

165
00:11:18,126 --> 00:11:19,927
I can go.
- What?

166
00:11:20,026 --> 00:11:22,695
What?
- My name is Maya Dolittle.

167
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:25,735
And I can talk to animals,
just like my dad.

168
00:11:25,834 --> 00:11:29,618
Really?
- Really.

169
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,559
Jack of spades.
- Jack of spades.

170
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:45,066
<i>Oh, please. Four of hearts.
- Four ofhearts</i>

171
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,486
Like father, like daughter.

172
00:11:49,586 --> 00:11:51,960
Hold on. I need
to make a call.

173
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:55,261
Okay. Well, just
take your time.

174
00:11:55,361 --> 00:12:00,330
Maya, I am not sure that this is a good idea.
- Mom.

175
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,468
The admissions committee said I
needed to impress them, right? - Mm-hmm.

176
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:06,740
So if I can get a recommendation
from the president of the United States...

177
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,178
what's more impressive than that?
- I don't know, honey.

178
00:12:10,277 --> 00:12:12,613
Huh?

179
00:12:12,713 --> 00:12:16,247
Yes, sir.
Yes, I understand.

180
00:12:16,347 --> 00:12:20,465
Well, Miss Dolittle, looks like
you're going to the White House.

181
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,735
We are goin' to the White House!
We are goin' to the White House! Ha-ha!

182
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,264
This is unfair!
This is an outrage!

183
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:31,598
I'm sorry, Monkey,
but you can't come.

184
00:12:31,698 --> 00:12:34,935
The last time I took you anywhere, we ended
up in jail for disturbing the peace.

185
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:38,170
If Olive Garden doesn't want you to
throw food, they should have a sign.

186
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,773
Look. I'm sorry, but
this is just too important.

187
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:45,146
My whole future is riding on this.
I'll bring you back some soap.

188
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,312
Later, Kong.

189
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:50,926
Once again, you underestimate
the tiny genius in the silly T-shirt.

190
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:07,966
<i># The TVsays I'm not
the girl that I should be #</i>

191
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:09,971
<i>#It drives me crazy #</i>

192
00:13:10,071 --> 00:13:13,874
<i>#I'm not impressed
It isn't what I want to be #</i>

193
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:15,877

00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:18,110

00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:24,418
<i>#Operator, operator #</i>

197
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:27,788
<i>#I'm just fine

198
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:31,923
<i># Why would I wanna be

199
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:33,945

200
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,799

201
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:39,801
<i>#I know I'm

202
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:42,270
<i># Without a doubt

203
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:44,868
<i>#I'm everything

204
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:47,674
<i>#A girl like me #</i>

205
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:50,409
<i>#A girl like me #
- Wow!</i>

206
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:54,079
<i>#A girl like me ##</i>

207
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:57,383
I felt the same way the first time
I walked through those doors.

208
00:13:57,483 --> 00:14:00,563
Come on.

209
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:09,063
Ah, porter,
my bag is in the trunk.

210
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:11,946
Careful with the squeezy bone.
It's a family heirloom.

211
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,470
Ah, Miss Dolittle.

212
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:20,172
Maya, this is the president's
chief of staff, Mr. Harold Dorion.

213
00:14:20,271 --> 00:14:23,876
Nice to meet you, Mr. Dorion.
- Welcome to the White House. This is Selma Dixon.

214
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:26,916
Both she and Cole are assigned
to my office as interns.

215
00:14:27,015 --> 00:14:30,250
Pleasure.
- Thank you, gentlemen. I'll take it from here.

216
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,487
Cole, Selma, I need those G.D.P. Reports
on Kalampore on my desk in an hour.

217
00:14:34,586 --> 00:14:37,025
You'll have them in half an hour, sir.
- Excellent.

218
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,062
This way, Miss Dolittle.

219
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:43,464
You know, the president
is very anxious to meet you, Maya.

220
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:48,768
And this is the West Wing. Although
the White House was finished in 800...

221
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:52,139
the West Wing wasn't
added until 902.

222
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:56,442
And the Oval Office itself
wasn't built until the 930s.

223
00:14:56,542 --> 00:15:00,347
For over 200 years, some of our
nation's most important decisions...

224
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:03,948
have been made right here
in this office.

225
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:08,052
I can't believe you're making me go. It's spring
break! All my friends are going to Florida!

226
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:10,154
<i>"All of your friends"are not
the president's daughter</i>

227
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:12,458
Courtney, this
is Maya Dolittle.

228
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:15,295
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

229
00:15:15,394 --> 00:15:18,930
We're hoping
she grows out of it.

230
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:23,284
Right, and I'm hoping they open
a Burger King for dogs, but I'm not optimistic.

231
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,810
Mr. President.
- Maya.

232
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:34,249
<i>Thank you for coming
I'm a huge fan of your father's</i>

233
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:39,418
It's an honor, Mr. President.
- And who is this good-looking guy?

234
00:15:39,517 --> 00:15:44,533
The man's got my vote.
- This is Lucky. He is also at your service, Mr. President.

235
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:48,928
You obviously understand dogs.
I hope you can help with mine.

236
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:51,630
Please, sit down.
Harold?

237
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:54,102
Yes, sir.

238
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:57,268
<i>Yes, everyone knows
and loves Daisy</i>

239
00:15:57,368 --> 00:16:01,243
Mee-yowza!
- Daisy's been with the family since I was governor.

240
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:04,043
She's been at my side
every step of my career.

241
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:07,948
She was instrumental in the
president's election campaign.

242
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:12,454
Look. There she is singing the
national anthem at a baseball game.

243
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,519
She was perfectly in tune.
- That is so cute!

244
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:20,056
Some people think she's a symbol
of this administration, of its humanity.

245
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:25,230
<i>But lately, our
beloved First Dog has become, well</i>

246
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:27,736
<i>a nightmare</i>

247
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:31,071
She's running amok and we
don't know what to do about it.

248
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,172
Ah, the woman of my dreams.
- Shh! Put a lid on it.

249
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:38,478
I beg your pardon?
- Oh, no, not you. Him.

250
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:41,078
<i>Sorry It takes
a while to get used to</i>

251
00:16:41,177 --> 00:16:45,019
So, basically what I'm hearing
is, is Daisy just needs a talking to.

252
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:49,086
I can handle that.
- There's more to it than that, Maya.

253
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:52,256
We're having a diplomatic crisis
with the country of Kalampore.

254
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:56,861
You see, Maya, Kalampore is home to the
worid's second largest tropical rain forest.

255
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,267
<i>The Boyd and Dunsmore Investment Group
wants to develop the land</i>

256
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:03,204
and has made a very lucrative
offer to the royal family of Kalampore.

257
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:07,107
If the development deal goes through,
the rain forest will be totally destroyed...

258
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:10,376
<i>and with it, thousands
of species that make it home</i>

259
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:12,178
<i>That's awful.
- But the president</i>

260
00:17:12,277 --> 00:17:14,683
has convinced the head of the
royal family, Prince Tharoor...

261
00:17:14,782 --> 00:17:18,519
<i>to reject the Dunsmore offer,
and instead has proposed a treaty</i>

262
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:21,118
that would permanently protect
the land as an animal preserve.

263
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:25,959
The prince was all set to sign this historic
agreement last month in Kalampore...

264
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:29,127
and things went
horribly wrong.

265
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:34,034
Unfortunately, the president came down
with a terrible case of... food poisoning.

266
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:36,470
Oh, no, he didn't.
- Oh, no, don't say it.

267
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,217
Oh, yes.
All over the prince.

268
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:44,608
Jelly beans?
- No, thank you.

269
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:49,382
The deal didn't get signed.
The moment passed...

270
00:17:49,481 --> 00:17:51,386
and the deal fell apart.

271
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:53,388
Oh, no.

272
00:17:53,488 --> 00:17:57,657
<i>We've invited the prince to the US
We're gonna hold a state dinner in his honor</i>

273
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:00,859
It's a last-ditch effort
to repair the relationship...

274
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,898
and convince him to sign
the agreement.

275
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:05,062
And that's where you
come in, Maya. You see...

276
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:07,867
the prince's daughter
is a huge fan of Daisy.

277
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:10,270
She's practically
Daisy crazy.

278
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,838
And of course, she wants
to meet her... in person.

279
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:17,312
<i>Yikes.
- Exactly</i>

280
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:20,945
The prince arrives
in... eight days.

281
00:18:21,045 --> 00:18:24,616
What- Eight days?

282
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:27,088
Maya...
- l-

283
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:30,958
we need you to deliver the old Daisy
before the state dinner.

284
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:32,977
We are counting on you.

285
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,646
Send in Daisy, please.

286
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,775
<i>Hi, Daisy. I'm-
- Listen</i>

287
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:52,545
If you think you can waltz in here with your
head-shrinking, animal-talking circus act...

288
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:55,314
<i>and turn me into some perfect,
hand-licking First Dog</i>

289
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:57,819
<i>then you've got another
thing coming, sister</i>

290
00:18:57,918 --> 00:18:59,984
I'll chew you up like
an off-white athletic sock...

291
00:19:00,084 --> 00:19:02,991
then I'll poop you out
in the Rose Garden.

292
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,976
Wh-What did she say, Maya?

293
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,828
Uh, she said, "Hi."

294
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:11,746
Ah.

295
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,902
Hello, Daisy.

296
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:20,875
Daisy! Uh, Maya, please
tell her not to do that.

297
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:24,311
Daisy, do not sneeze on
the chief of staff s pants.

298
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:26,956
Oh. Okay. Well, then how
'bout this sort of thing?

299
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,697
Daisy.

300
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:39,339
Oh!

301
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,895
Harold.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Come here, Daisy-

302
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:46,834
Nice try, Harold.
- Daisy!

303
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:49,911
<i>Daisy, sit!
- Daisy, no!</i>

304
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,048
<i>#I'm tired, baby
Tired of messin'with my head #</i>

305
00:20:02,147 --> 00:20:04,614
Whoops.
- No!

306
00:20:04,714 --> 00:20:07,453
<i>#Gonna pull myself
from the ledge ##</i>

307
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:09,905
<i>Whoops!</i>

308
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,404
See ya.
Wouldn't wanna be ya.

309
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,641
What a ride.

310
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,404
Harold.
- Sir?

311
00:20:26,504 --> 00:20:28,809
Have everybody pack up-

312
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:33,343
<i>the staff, the interns,
the dog, Courtney.</i>

313
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:35,730
<i>We're going
to the ranch today!</i>

314
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,821
The ranch?

315
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,888
The Sterling Ranch.
The president's... retreat.

316
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:47,070
I call shotgun!

317
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,419
Maya, come with me.

318
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:51,156
Anyone else who wants
the grand tour, hop in.

319
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:54,974
Go on. Go on.
I don't need you.

320
00:22:02,587 --> 00:22:05,920
<i>All right, here we go</i>

321
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,432
Hey, anyone over there
got lotion? My skin is so dry.

322
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,592
Hmm, maybe I can find
some aloe in here.

323
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:04,228
Where do all the animals come from?
- Oh, different places.

324
00:23:04,328 --> 00:23:08,703
Some were rescued, some were gifts
of foreign dignitaries.

325
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:11,802
We started the reserve to protect
a few endangered species.

326
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:14,404
And now we have
over 30 species.

327
00:23:14,504 --> 00:23:18,953
Dozens have been bred
and released back into the wild.

328
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,507
Hey, hey! How's
the weather down there?

329
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,762
Wow! It's incredible.

330
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:41,114
Hey, guys, look-
people.

331
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:49,309
This land has been in my family
for over a century.

332
00:23:49,408 --> 00:23:53,078
About 5 years ago, I
fulfilled a dream of a lifetime:

333
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:58,125
Created this nature preserve
and family retreat.

334
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,557
I'm not really
an animal person.

335
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,659
Allergies.

336
00:24:08,758 --> 00:24:10,681
<i>Hmph.</i>

337
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,370
Many of the worid's
greatest leaders have stayed here.

338
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:18,339
<i>And a lot ofhistory
made in this place</i>

339
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:22,985
It's my hope that next week...
history will be made again.

340
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,699
Ahh. Free at last.

341
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:48,548
Now where can a monkey
freshen up around here?

342
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:57,217
And this brings us back
to the compound.

343
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:02,047
<i>Everybody,
heads up! Incoming!</i>

344
00:25:02,146 --> 00:25:05,215
What's that?

345
00:25:05,315 --> 00:25:08,453
Oh, that used to be
Courtney's play yard.

346
00:25:08,553 --> 00:25:12,792
Now we use it for some animals who live
over there in a specially designed habitat.

347
00:25:12,892 --> 00:25:15,244
Go take a look.
- Okay.

348
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:20,268
<i>Hold up a second,
blokes Whoa Look at the sheila</i>

349
00:25:20,368 --> 00:25:23,569
Hola, chica.
- Wow, hey, guys.

350
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:25,607
Hi, darling. How ya doin'?

351
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:27,406
Hello, beautiful
lady person.

352
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:30,445
Oh, no. This is bad.
I am sensing very bad.

353
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:33,414
Don't mind him. He's a few
sandwiches short of a picnic.

354
00:25:33,514 --> 00:25:35,883
<i>Look out below!</i>

355
00:25:35,982 --> 00:25:38,751
Lucky, this is a wallaby.

356
00:25:38,851 --> 00:25:42,921
A rock wallaby to be exact.
As in rock and roll! Bonzer good times!

357
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,861
Whoo-hoo! Oi, mates. Let's party!
Where's the Pop Tarts? Come on!

358
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,459
Let's go!

359
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,730
Okay, that wallaby
needs to chill.

360
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:54,932
<i>Tell me about it Reminds me
of this guy I used to date, Javier</i>

361
00:25:55,032 --> 00:25:58,305
<i>Always about how his fur
looked I'm Rosie, by the way</i>

362
00:25:58,404 --> 00:26:00,308
You need the 4
on anyone or anything?

363
00:26:00,408 --> 00:26:02,974
These ears can hear a pin drop
from a thousand yards.

364
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:05,811
<i>She calls it 411
I call it gossip</i>

365
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:08,282
And gossip is bad-
very, very bad.

366
00:26:08,381 --> 00:26:10,149
Oh, put an ant in it,
bug breath.

367
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:13,329
Let's party!

368
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,257
It was great. Yeah.
- You liked it.

369
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:18,366
Scintillating.

370
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,140
Wow. I love what
you've done with the place.

371
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:29,733
What happened?
- Daisy.

372
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:34,270
But we've only been here a few minutes.
- She works fast.

373
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,261
Welcome to Sterling Ranch.
Hope you have a pleasant stay.

374
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,616
Come on, Daisy.
Good girl. Here we go.

375
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:47,020
<i>Mr Rresident?</i>

376
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,254
Maya, I have to go
to a meeting.

377
00:26:49,353 --> 00:26:52,057
The porters will show you
to your room.

378
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:54,373
I'm afraid you have
your work cut out for you.

379
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,928
Smile therapy?

380
00:26:58,027 --> 00:27:01,031
Oh, forget it!
That doesn't work anyway!

381
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,020
<i>Not on the bookcase</i>

382
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,875
Well, I'm unpacked.

383
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:13,943
What am I gonna do? Daisy's not a dog.
She's Hannibal Lecter with fur!

384
00:27:14,043 --> 00:27:17,418
I may be able to talk to animals,
but I cannot work miracles.

385
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:21,220
<i>Maya, one thing I know about you is that
you underestimate yourself.</i>

386
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:24,023
And sometimes you don't
apply yourself completely.

387
00:27:24,122 --> 00:27:26,027
Have you been reading
my report card again?

388
00:27:26,127 --> 00:27:28,029
Read it? I forged your
dad's signature, remember?

389
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:30,295
If I want a recommendation
from the president...

390
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:34,567
I'm gonna have to whip crazy Daisy
into shape in less than a week.

391
00:27:34,666 --> 00:27:38,236
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

392
00:27:38,335 --> 00:27:40,337
I think I've bitten off
more than I can chew.

393
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:44,210
Been there. Never forget that time
I caught the Volkswagen.

394
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,680
I wish I could reach Dad.
He would know what to do.

395
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:51,748
Why don't you just figure out what he would
do in the same situation, and try that?

396
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:53,754
Hey, that's not such
a bad idea.

397
00:27:53,854 --> 00:27:57,956
We're not man's
best friend for nothin'.

398
00:27:58,055 --> 00:28:01,294
Hey. Hey, can you fix my hair?
I don't have thumbs.

399
00:28:01,393 --> 00:28:04,827
First of all, Daisy, I would like to thank you
for agreeing to meet with me.

400
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:07,267
That was very civilized
and mature of you.

401
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:10,136
Well, I got to thinking
about my recent behavior...

402
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:12,769
and decided it was
probably time to get some help.

403
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:15,574
Oh, okay.
So, um, tell me...

404
00:28:15,673 --> 00:28:19,845
when did you first notice these
feelings of hostility surfacing?

405
00:28:19,944 --> 00:28:23,317
<i>Gosh I think, maybe, it
all began when the president</i>

406
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:25,516
started bringing home
all these other animals.

407
00:28:25,615 --> 00:28:27,184
I see. I see.

408
00:28:27,283 --> 00:28:30,191
I think I might be,
well, jealous?

409
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:34,094
Yes, jealous.
I see. I see.

410
00:28:34,194 --> 00:28:36,828
In fact, I just have so much
to get off my chest...

411
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:40,233
maybe it would be a good idea
if we all met, you know, like-

412
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:44,604
Group therapy?
- Yes! Group therapy!

413
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:47,157
I'll meet you at the
habitat in 0 minutes.

414
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,925
Maybe this won't be
as hard as I thought.

415
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:58,149
Hey, Daisy's back. How ya been, darlin'?
- What's the word, sister?

416
00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:01,819
Hey, you guys. I got a problem
that I need you to help me get rid of.

417
00:29:01,918 --> 00:29:05,672
Whatever you need, Daisy, girl.
- Your wish is my command, my Daisy.

418
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:27,076
Hello?
- Holy cow! You scared me to death.

419
00:29:27,176 --> 00:29:30,815
Uh, sorry.
- Close the door. Close the door!

420
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:32,719
<i>Would you please?
Would you close the door?</i>

421
00:29:32,818 --> 00:29:35,920
<i>Rlease close it!</i>

422
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:38,589
Uh, would you like to join us
for group therapy?

423
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,758
Oh, I would love to,
but what if I see my shadow?

424
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:45,327
<i>What if I don't? It could affect the climate
of the entire planet if I do</i>

425
00:29:45,427 --> 00:29:49,100
Ah, the pressure is killing me!
- An agoraphobic groundhog?

426
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,212
Pretty twisted, I know.

427
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,675
Okay. Well, I guess
I'll just see you later.

428
00:29:56,775 --> 00:30:00,681
Maybe.

429
00:30:00,781 --> 00:30:05,395
<i>Go to your safe place Go to
your safe place Go to your safe place</i>

430
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:13,728
Everyone, this is Maya.
And she can talk to animals.

431
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:15,527
Hello, Maya.

432
00:30:15,627 --> 00:30:18,797
Hi.

433
00:30:18,896 --> 00:30:22,033
Wait a second.
Have we met before?

434
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:25,568
No, no, never.
I am, uh, Aldo.

435
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:27,704
<i>Aldo, the Italian monkey</i>

436
00:30:27,804 --> 00:30:30,745
And I am from...
Napoli!

437
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:33,297
<i>Okay, Aldo</i>

438
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,215
So, as many of you
already know, this is Daisy...

439
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:41,087
and she's been having some issues
she would like to discuss with you guys.

440
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:43,624
Daisy?

441
00:30:43,724 --> 00:30:47,224
Okay. Well, Daisy's
having a quiet moment.

442
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:49,610
Is there anybody else
who'd like to say something?

443
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,868
Hmm.
- Mmm.

444
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:57,771
Conflicts? Issues? Anything?

445
00:30:57,871 --> 00:31:01,405
Come on, you guys. There's gotta be
something you wanna talk about.

446
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:06,678
Fine. I remember once back in New Delhi
at the zoo- Oh, this was very, very bad.

447
00:31:06,777 --> 00:31:10,414
If I have to hear this story one more time,
I'm gonna throw myself on a trap.

448
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:14,562
<i>You are rude. Very, very rude!
- I'm rude?</i>

449
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:20,092
People. I mean, folks.
I mean, animals!

450
00:31:20,191 --> 00:31:22,646
Everybody, just chill out!

451
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,764
Nyah.
- All right, that's just gross.

452
00:31:26,864 --> 00:31:30,367
Now let's all listen and respect
what each other has to say.

453
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:33,583
Actually, there is something
I'd like to say.

454
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,877
Bombs away!

455
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:39,725
Bomb bay doors open!

456
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,951
Aha! Bull's-eye!

457
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:48,422
<i>Nice shot Man
your battle stations!</i>

458
00:31:48,522 --> 00:31:51,054
To the barricades!

459
00:31:51,154 --> 00:31:52,905
Pass the ammunition.

460
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,831
Anteater! Run
for your lives!

461
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,599
Fire at will!

462
00:32:00,698 --> 00:32:02,502
Gotcha!

463
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:05,337
<i>Mon dieu!
I mean, mamma mia!</i>

464
00:32:05,437 --> 00:32:08,438
You better stop-

465
00:32:08,537 --> 00:32:10,357
Take-a this!

466
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,446
Stop it! Oh-

467
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:19,526
I demand you stop this behavior!

468
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,708
Direct hit!

469
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,524
One egg-a, scrambled!

470
00:32:28,624 --> 00:32:31,330
<i>So long, girlie!</i>

471
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:33,350
<i>Thanks for stoppin'by!</i>

472
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,679
All right, let's
get back to work.

473
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:52,258
I guess she's
the comic relief.

474
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,327
Hi. Can I have some
roast beef, please?

475
00:33:03,427 --> 00:33:07,897
How 'bout you accidentally drop a T-bone
on the ground for your old pal here?

476
00:33:07,997 --> 00:33:10,702
Forget about it. You
know it gives you gas.

477
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:14,019
Uh- Oh, no, not you.
The dog.

478
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,590
Don't judge me.

479
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,584
Excuse me.
Nature calls.

480
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:28,387
Hey, how's it goin'?
Have you tried the steak?

481
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:31,055
So, Maya, how did it
go today with Daisy?

482
00:33:31,154 --> 00:33:33,960
Uh, it was... colorful.

483
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,465
Hmm. Good colorful,
or bad colorful?

484
00:33:37,564 --> 00:33:40,062
Like a medium colorful.

485
00:33:40,162 --> 00:33:43,037
Well, I'm afraid a medium colorful
just isn't gonna cut it.

486
00:33:43,136 --> 00:33:46,636
Maya, we need bold, brilliant, vibrant,
primary colors here.

487
00:33:46,736 --> 00:33:50,774
We need a full-on, five-star
rainbow, and we need it fast.

488
00:33:50,873 --> 00:33:53,044
Yes, sir.
- Oh, and, Maya...

489
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:55,746
<i>that, uh, scene today
outside the barn-</i>

490
00:33:55,846 --> 00:33:58,752
Just make sure that kind of thing doesn't
happen in front of the president.

491
00:33:58,852 --> 00:34:03,122
I will, sir. I mean, I won't.
It-It won't, sir.

492
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:05,141
Good.

493
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,993
Okay, check it out:
"Herro," Shaggy.

494
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:11,763
Rooby-rooby-doo!

495
00:34:11,862 --> 00:34:14,566
<i>That's my Scooby-Doo</i>

496
00:34:14,665 --> 00:34:18,004
Gee, with that material, I'm surprised
you don't have your own TV show.

497
00:34:18,104 --> 00:34:20,069
<i>Wait Hang on</i>

498
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:22,649
"Herro," Reorge. Ruh-oh.

499
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,077
<i>Astro?</i>

500
00:34:27,176 --> 00:34:29,583
<i>From TheJetsons?</i>

501
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:32,485
<i>You have got
to get some new material.</i>

502
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:36,438
Tough crowd.
- Thank you.

503
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:50,053
Maya, you want to join us?
- Sure.

504
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,606
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mayo.
Did you want to sit here?

505
00:34:55,705 --> 00:34:59,220
It's Maya.

506
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,483
So, Maya, tell us
a little bit about yourself.

507
00:35:03,582 --> 00:35:07,454
Oh, uh, well, I'm a senior
at Hamilton High in San Francisco.

508
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:10,390
<i>Really? And where are
you going to school next year?</i>

509
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,557
Um, well, I'm still
assessing my options.

510
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:15,908
But I'm considering
S.F.U.'s vet school.

511
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:22,268
But why can't I go?
- We've been over this before.

512
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:24,569
You can't go because I think
it's inappropriate...

513
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:26,804
for the First Daughter
to be at a party unsupervised.

514
00:35:26,903 --> 00:35:30,407
This is so unfair!
Mom would let me go.

515
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:35,011
Well, your mother happens to be making a
four-nation tour, and I'm in charge around here.

516
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:38,952
What about you guys? Where do you go?
- We both go to Yale.

517
00:35:39,051 --> 00:35:42,220
I'm a poli-sci major, and Selma's studying
International Relations.

518
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:46,491
With a minor in foreign languages:
French, German, Russian and Cantonese.

519
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:49,659
I intend to make an impact
on global politics by the time I'm 30.

520
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:52,531
<i>What about you?
What's your long-term goal?</i>

521
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:56,503
Long term? Um, I guess just
to take care of animals.

522
00:35:56,603 --> 00:36:00,373
Oh, you mean like a
doggie day care? How sweet.

523
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:03,574
No, I mean, like a
veterinarian. A doctor.

524
00:36:03,673 --> 00:36:08,346
But if you can't fix
the president's dog...

525
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:11,447
how are you gonna fix
other people's animals?

526
00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:15,017
Oh. Could you pass
the mayo, Maya?

527
00:36:15,117 --> 00:36:19,873
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?
I don't speak snob.

528
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,900
What?

529
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,904
I just don't understand you.
I mean, the state dinner could be fun if-

530
00:36:31,004 --> 00:36:34,774
Right. It's just so fun to have the
best years of my life sucked away...

531
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:39,477
by stupid press events, dull political speeches
and boring state dinners.

532
00:36:39,576 --> 00:36:41,555
Thanks, Dad!

533
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,392
Maya!
- Yes, sir.

534
00:36:52,491 --> 00:36:55,491
The chief tells me that
you're making headway with Daisy.

535
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:58,094
I want a full progress
report tomorrow, all right?

536
00:36:58,193 --> 00:37:00,514
Yes, sir, sir.
- I'm counting on you.

537
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:15,015
How can I give a progress report
when I haven't made any progress?

538
00:37:15,114 --> 00:37:18,817
I don't get why she doesn't dig me.
You think I should grow a beard?

539
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:21,788
Lucky, I have to find a different
way to deal with these animals.

540
00:37:21,888 --> 00:37:25,658
Because Dad's way just isn't working.
What usually works with you?

541
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:28,291
Well, a biscuit always
seems to do nicely.

542
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:31,815
Yeah, right,
like that's gonna work.

543
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,318
Hmm.

544
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,277
You comin' out today?

545
00:37:44,377 --> 00:37:46,814
I would, but I'm
shampooing my tail.

546
00:37:46,913 --> 00:37:48,956
Suit yourself.

547
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,787
Hey, everybody,
look what I've got. Treats!

548
00:37:56,886 --> 00:37:58,854
<i>Ding, ding Round two!</i>

549
00:37:58,954 --> 00:38:02,363
<i>Watch your
head, you monkey!</i>

550
00:38:02,462 --> 00:38:06,096
<i>Say hello to my little friend!
- There you go!</i>

551
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:09,699
<i>Enjoy my spicy red ant special</i>

552
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:13,471
<i>That's gonna be hard
to get out of your hair!</i>

553
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,475
<i>Oh, forget it!</i>

554
00:38:15,575 --> 00:38:18,357
<i>Come back soon, all right?</i>

555
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,583
<i>Maya What happened?</i>

556
00:38:24,682 --> 00:38:26,587
I, um-

557
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:28,487
See-

558
00:38:28,587 --> 00:38:31,769
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm no good at this.

559
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:36,903
Maya.
- Please, just leave me alone.

560
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,902
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

561
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:47,740
I'm never gonna get that recommendation,
so why keep embarrassing myself?

562
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,277
But what about Daisy and me?
You know, she completes me.

563
00:38:50,377 --> 00:38:54,281
Look. I've already let down my family
and the president of the United States.

564
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:58,252
Forget it. I'm cuttin' my losses.
We're on the next copter out of here.

565
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:03,786
<i>Cole, I said I just
wanna be left... alone.</i>

566
00:39:03,885 --> 00:39:06,855
Maya, am I...
interrupting?

567
00:39:06,955 --> 00:39:08,794
No, sir. I was just
packing up.

568
00:39:08,894 --> 00:39:14,532
I'm sorry I disappointed you, sir, but I should
have never come here in the first place.

569
00:39:14,631 --> 00:39:17,212
Maya, let's take a walk.

570
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:32,015
<i>You remind me a lot of
myself when I was your age</i>

571
00:39:32,114 --> 00:39:34,853
I do?
- Demanded a lot of myself.

572
00:39:34,953 --> 00:39:38,224
Expected way too much
too soon.

573
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:40,743
<i>Meet my friends</i>

574
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,630
So, did you know...

575
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:51,003
that MichaelJordan...

576
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:55,307
didn't make his high school
varsity basketball team?

577
00:39:55,406 --> 00:40:00,179
MichaelJordan? The best
basketball player ever? No way.

578
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:03,549
Way.

579
00:40:03,648 --> 00:40:08,021
Did you know that Einstein failed
his first college entrance exam?

580
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:12,655
<i>Wait. "E" equals "MC" squared Einstein? Really?
- Yep</i>

581
00:40:12,755 --> 00:40:17,828
Did you know in high school
I ran for class president?

582
00:40:17,927 --> 00:40:21,768
I lost.
I came in fourth.

583
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:24,434
Well, that's not too bad.

584
00:40:24,534 --> 00:40:28,673
Out of four?
- Okay, that's bad.

585
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:31,043
The only thing that
saved me at that time...

586
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:34,480
was I had a motto I kept
on my desk by Hank Aaron...

587
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,147
a famous ballplayer
before your time.

588
00:40:37,246 --> 00:40:40,452
Two words:
"Keep swinging."

589
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:44,391
<i>He used to say that no matter
how bad his slump was</i>

590
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,556
no matter how badly
he felt...

591
00:40:46,656 --> 00:40:49,760
he just had
to keep swingin'.

592
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:52,496
But, sir, I'm just afraid I can't-
- Maya.

593
00:40:52,596 --> 00:40:55,969
"We have nothing to fear
but fear itself."

594
00:40:56,068 --> 00:40:59,102
That was Franklin Roosevelt.

595
00:40:59,201 --> 00:41:02,682
You come with me. There's
somebody I want you to meet.

596
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,500
Come on, Maya.

597
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,683
<i>So, this is Lenore</i>

598
00:41:14,783 --> 00:41:16,899
She's a red ruffed lemur.

599
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:22,268
Give her some
gooseberries. She likes 'em.

600
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,671
She was captured by poachers as a baby,
delivered to a Malaysian circus.

601
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:35,338
Somehow she made her way
to an Indonesian zoo and then here.

602
00:41:35,438 --> 00:41:37,344
<i>She's an endangered species</i>

603
00:41:37,444 --> 00:41:39,610
And we had hopes of returning
her to her homeland...

604
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:42,447
but unless I can get the prince
to sign this agreement...

605
00:41:42,547 --> 00:41:44,467
the rain forest
will be destroyed.

606
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:48,718
And the other lemurs like Lenore?
- Absolutely.

607
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:52,923
Did you know that, on average,
74 species a day become extinct?

608
00:41:53,023 --> 00:41:55,794
I had no idea.
- Most people don't.

609
00:41:55,894 --> 00:41:58,394
<i>All of us have so much
more to learn</i>

610
00:41:58,493 --> 00:42:03,870
Maya, failure is a part of life,
even for successful people.

611
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:07,706
The trick is... what are
you gonna do about the failure?

612
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:11,454
Are you gonna quit, or are
you gonna keep on swinging?

613
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,120
Lucky, drop that bone,
unpack those bags.

614
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,392
I just got a pep talk from the
president of the United States.

615
00:42:27,491 --> 00:42:29,396
And we are stayin'.

616
00:42:29,496 --> 00:42:32,995
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

617
00:42:33,095 --> 00:42:36,098
Whoa. Getting dizzy.
Oh, getting dizzy.

618
00:42:36,197 --> 00:42:40,782
Why do dogs have to do this
when they're happy?

619
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,674
<i>#And if you think #</i>

620
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:48,480
<i># That you
could do better #</i>

621
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,080
<i>#She's got some
pretty wise sage advice #</i>

622
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:54,954
<i>#For you if you let her #</i>

623
00:42:55,053 --> 00:42:57,424
<i>#And she'll
let you know #</i>

624
00:42:57,523 --> 00:43:00,022
<i># We never go
in the heat of competition #</i>

625
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:01,961
<i># Tell me everything
you know #</i>

626
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,466
<i>#About the human
condition And wait #</i>

627
00:43:05,565 --> 00:43:07,934
<i># Till the meter maids
are doin'their job #</i>

628
00:43:08,033 --> 00:43:12,270
<i>#And they're callin'the cops
'cause they're afraid too #</i>

629
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:15,257
<i># 'Cause it's makin'a lot #</i>

630
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,391
<i>What are you doing?</i>

631
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:39,245
Did you know that Cavalier King Charles
spaniels were originally bred for British royalty?

632
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:43,534
Here you go, Daisy.

633
00:43:43,634 --> 00:43:45,539
Okay.

634
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:48,717
So, what do you think?
What do you think?

635
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,535
Stee-rike one.

636
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,494
It's important that you keep me posted
on exactly when and where...

637
00:44:11,594 --> 00:44:14,563
the prince and his-
when the prince comes-

638
00:44:14,663 --> 00:44:17,869
<i>Hold on a second</i>

639
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:19,873
Maya, what are you doing?

640
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:22,038
Did you know that King Charles
spaniels are the happiest...

641
00:44:22,138 --> 00:44:24,044
when they're sitting
in someone's lap?

642
00:44:24,144 --> 00:44:26,892
I think it's working.

643
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,366
I'll have to call you back.

644
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,705
Stee-rike two.

645
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,474
Do you know that your breed is extremely
social and loves to play and fetch?

646
00:44:56,573 --> 00:44:59,744
Two words: "Give up."
- Two words: "No way."

647
00:44:59,843 --> 00:45:01,979
One word: "Later"!

648
00:45:02,078 --> 00:45:05,297
Just keep swingin'.

649
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,018
Stee-rike three!
You're out.

650
00:45:09,118 --> 00:45:12,222
Remember back in ninth grade when I had
that cafeteria feud with Wendy Boudreau?

651
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:15,729
Who could forget her? Her face looked like
the business end of a bulldog.

652
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:20,430
And how did I handle that situation?
I made friends with her friends.

653
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,998
Interesting. I would
have just pooped in her shoes.

654
00:45:23,097 --> 00:45:26,750
Lucky, I think it's time for
another group therapy sessin.

655
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,816
Come on.

656
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:42,485
Hey, are you gonna join us today?

657
00:45:42,585 --> 00:45:44,356
Ah, uh, yeah, I, um-

658
00:45:44,455 --> 00:45:47,625
Remember what F.D.R. Said:
"We have nothing to fear but fear itself."

659
00:45:47,724 --> 00:45:51,030
<i>You're right You're right You're absolutely
right I'm coming out Here I come</i>

660
00:45:51,129 --> 00:45:53,033
Doh!

661
00:45:53,133 --> 00:45:57,383
<i>I just can't do it
- Okay. Whenever you're ready.</i>

662
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:08,013
All right, Maya.
Let's go make some friends.

663
00:46:08,112 --> 00:46:10,348
Hello, everyone.

664
00:46:10,448 --> 00:46:13,117
How are y'all doin' today?
- Rats!

665
00:46:13,216 --> 00:46:16,661
I think last time we started off on the
wrong foot. Let's start off fresh, shall we?

666
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:24,497
You have foiled my poop bomb.
I am most impressed.

667
00:46:24,597 --> 00:46:28,299
Horacio, I know you miss
your girlfriends back in Venezuela.

668
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:30,567
Yes. This is true.

669
00:46:30,667 --> 00:46:34,304
You're feeling lonely because you're the only
Amazon parrot within a hundred-mile radius.

670
00:46:34,404 --> 00:46:37,074
Yes. This, too, is true.

671
00:46:37,174 --> 00:46:40,980
You're feeling the pressure of having
to be exotic and colorful 24-7.

672
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:43,213
You have seen
into my soul.

673
00:46:43,312 --> 00:46:45,234
Wait a second.
What's goin' on here?

674
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:53,522
<i>Bruce, you're numbing out,
partying all the time</i>

675
00:46:53,622 --> 00:46:56,259
because you feel like, otherwise,
everybody's gonna think you're boring.

676
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:59,265
Isn't that right?
- Crikey, you don't know what it's like...

677
00:46:59,365 --> 00:47:01,283
to be a party animal.

678
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,602
And, Rosie, you like
gossiping all the time...

679
00:47:05,702 --> 00:47:09,007
because then you feel like
you're the center of attention.

680
00:47:09,107 --> 00:47:12,174
But you feel some deep shame
when it's all over, don't you?

681
00:47:12,274 --> 00:47:15,879
I just wanna be liked.
- I like you, mate.

682
00:47:15,978 --> 00:47:20,184
Yeah. We all think that you're
an amazing chinchilla, don't we?

683
00:47:20,284 --> 00:47:22,087
Don't we?
- I like you, Rosie.

684
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:24,022
Me too.
- Me three.

685
00:47:24,122 --> 00:47:26,891
Hey, don't fall for this.
She's trying to trick you.

686
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:29,958
And, Aldo, my
monkey friend...

687
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:34,496
<i>I know you miss your carefree days
ofbeing in the alfresco markets of Italy</i>

688
00:47:34,596 --> 00:47:37,037
You're sad because you
miss your family back in Naples.

689
00:47:37,136 --> 00:47:41,603
<i>You miss your papa's red wine
and your sweet grandmama's cannoli</i>

690
00:47:41,703 --> 00:47:44,240
Ah, sweet grandmama.

691
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,342
I am not Aldo or Italian.

692
00:47:46,441 --> 00:47:50,264
I do not even have a grandmama.
L- It's me, Maya, your Monkey!

693
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,719
Oh, I know, Monkey. And I'm so sorry.

694
00:47:54,818 --> 00:47:57,968
<i>And I'll never
leave you again, okay?</i>

695
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:07,134
Off you go.
- That is so beautiful.

696
00:48:07,233 --> 00:48:11,017
Anteater? Come on. Blow.

697
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,572
Come on, you guys. Get it together.

698
00:48:16,672 --> 00:48:21,778
<i>Repeat after me:
"This is very, very good"</i>

699
00:48:21,878 --> 00:48:25,184
This is very,
very... good.

700
00:48:25,283 --> 00:48:29,352
See? Now how does that feel?
- It feels very, very... good!

701
00:48:29,452 --> 00:48:33,326
<i>You seem all right, girlie Why would
you want to send Daisy to the pound?</i>

702
00:48:33,425 --> 00:48:36,627
What? The pound? Where would
you get a crazy idea like that?

703
00:48:36,727 --> 00:48:39,599
I'll give you one guess.

704
00:48:39,698 --> 00:48:41,548
Aha!

705
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,337
<i>I'm outta here.
- Ay, Daisy, please</i>

706
00:48:45,437 --> 00:48:47,340
<i>Don't go
- Daisy, come back</i>

707
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,619
<i>Oh, and I was
just starting to feel good</i>

708
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:54,847
<i>What am I gonna do? The
prince is gonna be here in two days</i>

709
00:48:54,946 --> 00:48:58,379
I just don't understand
why Daisy's behaving this way.

710
00:48:58,479 --> 00:49:00,718
There must be something
I'm missing, but what?

711
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:03,054
<i>Hello?</i>

712
00:49:03,154 --> 00:49:06,075
Hey, did you hear that?
- What is it, Lucky?

713
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,495
Yeah. Yeah, I
can totally come.

714
00:49:12,594 --> 00:49:16,416
Clearwater Campground.
Okay. I'll be there.

715
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,258
I can't see. What's she
doing? What's she doing?

716
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:43,245
Something she
shouldn't be doing.

717
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,518
<i>Just a second</i>

718
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:54,706
Hey, Maya.
- Hey, can you do me a huge favor?

719
00:49:54,805 --> 00:49:59,421
Can you drive me somewhere? No questions asked.
- I would, but I don't have a car.

720
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:04,247
Gotta be some wheels
around here somewhere.

721
00:50:04,346 --> 00:50:07,531
You know, we can probably find somethin'.
- Okay.

722
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,689
Man, can you make
this thing go any faster?

723
00:50:14,789 --> 00:50:17,928
I'm already pedal
to the metal.

724
00:50:18,028 --> 00:50:21,712
This Clearwater Campground
has to be around here somewhere.

725
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:31,122
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

726
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:57,950
<i>That's great
- Where did you get that?</i>

727
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:11,448
<i>Great. So now
you're following me?</i>

728
00:51:11,547 --> 00:51:14,955
It's bad enough I've got Secret Service on
my back. Now I've got the Dog Chatterer?

729
00:51:15,054 --> 00:51:17,552
Your dad would freak out
if he found out you were here...

730
00:51:17,652 --> 00:51:20,526
without Secret Service protection.
- I can take care of myself.

731
00:51:20,626 --> 00:51:24,862
<i>Yeah Right
- Wait a minute Now I know where I know you from</i>

732
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:28,598
You're the president's freakin' daughter.
- What? No. No, I'm- I'm-

733
00:51:28,698 --> 00:51:31,638
Dude, dude! It's the
First freakin' Daughter, man.

734
00:51:31,737 --> 00:51:33,552
<i>Who's got a camera?
- No!</i>

735
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,410
<i>Come on. Come on. One picture.
- No No pictures</i>

736
00:51:37,509 --> 00:51:39,845
She said, no pictures.

737
00:51:39,945 --> 00:51:43,114
Oh, and what are you gonna
do, huh? Call Secret Service?

738
00:51:43,213 --> 00:51:45,815
Ow!
- No, but I will.

739
00:51:45,915 --> 00:51:48,186
I think it's time to leave.

740
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:51,286
He got served.
- Oh!

741
00:51:51,385 --> 00:51:54,659
<i>Cute
- How did you do that?</i>

742
00:51:54,758 --> 00:51:58,737
Fifteen years of tae
kwon do classes just paid off.

743
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:07,054
I'll be right back. You
giris stay right here, okay?

744
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,354
So...

745
00:52:21,454 --> 00:52:25,704
I suppose you think I'm a spoiled, ungrateful,
irresponsible brat.

746
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,941
The thought
crossed my mind.

747
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:37,336
You have no idea what it's like
to be the daughter...

748
00:52:37,436 --> 00:52:40,806
of a national hero- all the
expectations that are heaped on you-

749
00:52:40,906 --> 00:52:44,311
And you feel like you'll never be able to
measure up to your father's greatness-

750
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:47,780
like you have to be perfect
all the time- so what's the point?

751
00:52:47,879 --> 00:52:50,059
Yes, exactly. How did-

752
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,586
<i>Your father.
- That's right.</i>

753
00:52:53,686 --> 00:52:55,852
Dr. Dolittle,
beloved veterinarian.

754
00:52:55,952 --> 00:52:59,556
National hero.
- Mm-hmm.

755
00:52:59,655 --> 00:53:02,359
This past year I lost sight
of my priorities.

756
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:05,331
I let my grades drop, blew off
my responsibilities...

757
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,734
and completely screwed up
my college application.

758
00:53:09,834 --> 00:53:14,139
But I think the truth is,
I was afraid-

759
00:53:14,238 --> 00:53:18,476
afraid I wouldn't be able to live up
to my father's reputation.

760
00:53:18,576 --> 00:53:23,747
And comin' here helped me remember
what's important to me in my life...

761
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:28,270
and that's the animals- even though I had
to mess up big-time to figure that out.

762
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:32,657
It's just...

763
00:53:32,756 --> 00:53:36,128
he always expects me
to be perfect.

764
00:53:36,228 --> 00:53:38,361
Now do you really
believe that?

765
00:53:38,461 --> 00:53:41,929
Or is that just what you tell yourself
so you can stay mad at him?

766
00:53:42,029 --> 00:53:44,667
Your father is not perfect.

767
00:53:44,767 --> 00:53:47,870
He makes mistakes
just like everybody else.

768
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:51,940
Did you know that he ran for class president and lost?
- No way.

769
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:54,644
Way.

770
00:53:54,743 --> 00:53:56,649
So just give him a chance...

771
00:53:56,749 --> 00:53:59,964
and you'll realize that he
just wants what's best for you.

772
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,093
<i>Not a word from
either one of you.</i>

773
00:54:11,192 --> 00:54:14,082
<i>No, pink's totally
your color</i>

774
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,880
Come on.
Hop up here.

775
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,162
Hey! Who's hungry?

776
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:33,483
<i># You can't
see it coming #</i>

777
00:54:33,582 --> 00:54:36,618
<i># Until it's too late #</i>

778
00:54:36,718 --> 00:54:38,855
<i># You're struck
down by the hand of fate #</i>

779
00:54:38,954 --> 00:54:41,794
Hot fudge is comin' in here.

780
00:54:41,893 --> 00:54:44,527
<i># With or without #</i>

781
00:54:44,627 --> 00:54:47,549
<i>#And when you do it's always too late #
- Looks so good.</i>

782
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:53,768
<i>#Ooh, it's all sunshine #
- Sprinkles.</i>

783
00:54:53,867 --> 00:54:57,473
<i>#Or it's all rain #
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

784
00:54:57,573 --> 00:55:00,324
<i>#Ooh, it's all sunshine ## -
Enough sprinkles! - Let's eat.</i>

785
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,247
Gotta get some
whipped cream.

786
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:06,719
Whoop!

787
00:55:06,818 --> 00:55:09,987
Oh, you think
that's funny, huh?

788
00:55:10,086 --> 00:55:11,991
That's funny? Uh, okay.

789
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:14,509
Here.

790
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,870
Whoa!

791
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:27,037
Courtney, where have you been? We have
been looking everywhere for you.

792
00:55:27,137 --> 00:55:30,639
Well, I, uh-

793
00:55:30,738 --> 00:55:33,477
Uh, s-sir, it was...
all my fault.

794
00:55:33,577 --> 00:55:38,648
<i>I snuck out, and Courtney
followed me and Cole followed her</i>

795
00:55:38,747 --> 00:55:40,985
Maya, this is not
fun and games here.

796
00:55:41,085 --> 00:55:43,889
<i>The prince's visit
is in two days'time</i>

797
00:55:43,988 --> 00:55:48,557
and as far as I can see, Daisy is no farther
along than she was a week ago.

798
00:55:48,657 --> 00:55:54,000
I'm sorry, sir. It won't happen again.
- Make sure that it doesn't.

799
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:57,212
Cole, we'll talk about this in the morning.
- Yes, sir.

800
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:01,552
And your father wants
to see you immediately.

801
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:13,686
<i>That was pretty cool of you back there,
takin'the hit for Courtney</i>

802
00:56:13,785 --> 00:56:18,089
That was pretty cool of you back at that party.
I don't know what we would have done without you.

803
00:56:18,189 --> 00:56:21,093
Yeah, well, I'm
glad I could help out.

804
00:56:21,193 --> 00:56:23,292
I've never seen Courtney
laugh like that.

805
00:56:23,392 --> 00:56:27,030
Yeah, I have a feeling things are gonna
start changing for the better.

806
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,633
It's just the pressure of bein' the First Daughter.
- Who could blame her?

807
00:56:31,733 --> 00:56:35,737
Yeah. Now if only Daisy
was that simple to figure out.

808
00:56:35,836 --> 00:56:39,124
<i>Wait a minute.
Maybe Daisy is that simple.</i>

809
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:45,918
I can't believe it. It's been right
under my nose the entire time.

810
00:56:46,018 --> 00:56:48,470
Oh, you are a genius!

811
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:52,599
I... didn't...
say anything.

812
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,042
<i>Daisy!</i>

813
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:00,172
Daisy!

814
00:57:01,518 --> 00:57:04,268
Where could she have gone?

815
00:57:04,368 --> 00:57:06,345
Daisy!

816
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:15,043
Daisy!

817
00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:17,449
Come on, girl.
Dais-

818
00:57:17,548 --> 00:57:21,685
Rosie, I have been looking for Daisy all
over the place. Have you heard anything?

819
00:57:21,784 --> 00:57:24,387
I might have heard a
few things, but I can't say.

820
00:57:24,486 --> 00:57:28,591
What? Why not?
- I gave up gossiping. I am a changed chinchilla.

821
00:57:28,691 --> 00:57:31,462
Rosie, that's not gossiping.
That's helping out a friend.

822
00:57:31,562 --> 00:57:33,764
Hmm.

823
00:57:33,864 --> 00:57:37,770
Here. I think we should conclude
with this paragraph right here.

824
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:40,306
You guys, Daisy's gone.
She ran away.

825
00:57:40,406 --> 00:57:42,842
What?
Well, let's go find her.

826
00:57:42,942 --> 00:57:46,745
Cole, we have a presentation
due in two hours for the chief of staff.

827
00:57:46,845 --> 00:57:49,012
It's just a dog.

828
00:57:49,111 --> 00:57:52,782
Just a dog? You know what? If that's really
what you think, then I feel sorry for you.

829
00:57:52,882 --> 00:57:57,155
<i>And I hate to break it to you, but some things
are more important than your career</i>

830
00:57:57,254 --> 00:57:59,231
Come on, Maya.

831
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:04,495
There's Courtney!
Courtney! Courtney!

832
00:58:04,595 --> 00:58:08,265
I've been looking for Daisy everywhere and
none of the other animals have seen her either.

833
00:58:08,364 --> 00:58:10,331
<i>I think she ran away</i>

834
00:58:10,431 --> 00:58:12,400
What?
- I can't find her anywhere.

835
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,858
Don't worry. We'll help you find her.
- Let's go this way.

836
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:25,013
Okay. Bruce,
you head out north.

837
00:58:25,113 --> 00:58:27,019
Horacio, Monkey,
you guys go south.

838
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,422
Chinchilla, keep your ear to
the ground. Lucky, you're with us.

839
00:58:30,521 --> 00:58:33,156
Leave no stone unturned.
We've got to find this dog.

840
00:58:33,256 --> 00:58:36,826
Yes. We go south! I have
no idea which way is south.

841
00:58:36,925 --> 00:58:40,530
Follow me. One thing
this bird's got is G.P.S.

842
00:58:40,629 --> 00:58:42,467
You got it, baby.
- Game on!

843
00:58:42,567 --> 00:58:44,713
Okay. Let's go.

844
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:53,743
Hey. Mind if I tag along?

845
00:58:53,843 --> 00:58:56,682
I figured you could use
all the help you could get.

846
00:58:56,781 --> 00:58:59,280
Thanks.

847
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,153
Come on.

848
00:59:02,252 --> 00:59:04,455
<i>Daisy!</i>

849
00:59:04,554 --> 00:59:06,825
Daisy! - Daisy!
- Here, girl!

850
00:59:06,924 --> 00:59:08,844
Daisy, come on!

851
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,932
Daisy! -
Daisy! - Daisy!

852
00:59:14,031 --> 00:59:16,497
We've been looking
for hours. It's no use.

853
00:59:16,597 --> 00:59:19,419
There's a thousand acres here.
She could be anywhere.

854
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:34,053
Anything, Lucky?
- Mm-mmm.

855
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:38,620
Reporting in from units two
and three. No sign of the pooch.

856
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:41,756
Courtney, is there anywhere
she would have gone?

857
00:59:41,856 --> 00:59:44,696
A special place,
somethin' like that? Think hard.

858
00:59:44,796 --> 00:59:47,341
I don't know.
I don't know.

859
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,182
Wait.
I have an idea.

860
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:59,051
We used to play here
all the time when I was a kid.

861
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,448
There she is!
- Wait.

862
01:00:02,548 --> 01:00:04,950
Can I have a minute
alone with her?

863
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:07,798
Come on. Trust me.

864
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:14,169
Okay. We'll meet you
back at the ranch.

865
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:24,081
Hey, girl.
- Go away.

866
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:32,475
Daisy, I know it's a lot of
pressure being the First Dog.

867
01:00:32,574 --> 01:00:36,448
You can rebel all you want, but you can't
run away from who you are. None of us can.

868
01:00:36,548 --> 01:00:39,013
I just want things to be
the way they used to be.

869
01:00:39,112 --> 01:00:41,284
When he was governor,
we were a family.

870
01:00:41,384 --> 01:00:46,258
<i>We would spend time together, play fetch,
go jogging, but now everything's changed</i>

871
01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:50,859
It's always the cameras, meetings, events,
and I'm just a political prop.

872
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:53,399
You are so much more
than that, Daisy.

873
01:00:53,499 --> 01:00:56,335
You are an inspiration
to the people of this country.

874
01:00:56,434 --> 01:00:59,535
And there's not many animals
or people who can even say that.

875
01:00:59,634 --> 01:01:01,540
I don't want to be
an inspiration.

876
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,510
I just want to be...
a dog.

877
01:01:04,609 --> 01:01:07,946
Daisy, come here. Come here.

878
01:01:08,046 --> 01:01:10,693
Come here, girl.

879
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:15,754
<i>You are a dog-
an amazing dog-</i>

880
01:01:15,854 --> 01:01:18,791
and you have a family
that loves you very much.

881
01:01:18,891 --> 01:01:23,391
But the thing is, every family has its own
set of problems, its frustrations...

882
01:01:23,491 --> 01:01:26,899
and we're always wishing
that things were different.

883
01:01:26,999 --> 01:01:31,100
But what if, instead of
running away from who we are...

884
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,105
we just started
embracing it.

885
01:01:33,205 --> 01:01:36,181
You're right, Maya.
You're right.

886
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,177
You sure they're gonna be
all right out there?

887
01:01:43,277 --> 01:01:45,325
I think we have
to trust her, Dad.

888
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,100
Hey, hey,
look, everyone!

889
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:54,560
Oh, Daisy!

890
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,306
<i>Come on! Come on, girl</i>

891
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,997
Daisy! Come on.
- Oh, good girl.

892
01:02:01,097 --> 01:02:03,002
Yeah.

893
01:02:03,102 --> 01:02:07,906
Don't you ever run away like that again.
You scared the daylights out of us.

894
01:02:08,005 --> 01:02:12,175
I think Daisy is finally ready to talk,
if you guys are ready to listen.

895
01:02:12,274 --> 01:02:16,527
Come on, girl. I've got
your favorite treats inside.

896
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:22,017
Courtney and I also had a talk this morning.
- Oh?

897
01:02:22,117 --> 01:02:27,122
She told me everything: About the party,
about how you covered for her.

898
01:02:27,221 --> 01:02:31,597
Gave us an opportunity for our first
really good talk in a long time...

899
01:02:31,697 --> 01:02:33,599
thanks to you, Maya.

900
01:02:33,699 --> 01:02:35,764
I'm glad I could help.

901
01:02:35,864 --> 01:02:38,400
Excellent work, Maya.

902
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:42,390
All right, everybody, we have
a state dinner to prepare for.

903
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:54,817
<i># Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa #</i>

904
01:02:54,916 --> 01:02:59,488
<i>#Someday #
- #I'll buy an old car #</i>

905
01:02:59,587 --> 01:03:03,996
<i>#Mmm #
- #Someday #</i>

906
01:03:04,096 --> 01:03:07,663
<i>#I'll get that car to start #
- #Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh #</i>

907
01:03:07,762 --> 01:03:12,137
<i>#Someday #
- #I'll learn how to drive too #</i>

908
01:03:12,237 --> 01:03:15,405
<i>#Mm-hmm and
then someday #</i>

909
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:19,310
<i>#Imagine all
the things I could do #</i>

910
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:22,815
<i># Whoo #
- #Someday #</i>

911
01:03:22,915 --> 01:03:26,847
<i>#I'll get that car to start #
- #Hoo-ooh, hoo-ooh #</i>

912
01:03:26,947 --> 01:03:29,017
<i>#Someday #</i>

913
01:03:29,117 --> 01:03:31,889
<i>#I'll learn
how to drive too #</i>

914
01:03:31,988 --> 01:03:34,055
<i># Yes, I will now
And then someday #</i>

915
01:03:34,155 --> 01:03:36,873
<i>#Imagine all the
things I could do ##</i>

916
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:06,289
Your Highness,
thank you for coming.

917
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:09,126
It's my great pleasure
to welcome you to Sterling Ranch.

918
01:04:09,225 --> 01:04:12,395
Mr. President,
it is indeed my pleasure.

919
01:04:12,495 --> 01:04:15,800
I look forward to a fruitful
and productive visit.

920
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:20,435
You must be tired from your travels.
My staff will show you to your quarters...

921
01:04:20,535 --> 01:04:22,908
and I look forward to seeing you
this evening at the dinner.

922
01:04:23,007 --> 01:04:25,586
Thank you,
Mr. President.

923
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,900
We've got our work
cut out for us.

924
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:55,153
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, please rise</i>

925
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,016
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
His Royal Highness</i>

926
01:05:08,115 --> 01:05:10,504
<i>Rrince Tharoor
of Kalampore</i>

927
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:18,861
Your Highness, welcome.
- Mr. President.

928
01:05:18,961 --> 01:05:22,266
May I present my
daughter, Courtney.

929
01:05:22,366 --> 01:05:24,842
My daughter,
Amina.

930
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:29,239
I'm so nervous.

931
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:33,728
It'll be fine. You've done everything you can.
- It's gonna go great.

932
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:41,320
Hi, Maya! Hey, it's us.
- Ay, beautiful fiesta.

933
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,586
I wanna go. I wanna go.
I wanna go!

934
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:47,390
Put a cork in it, Bonzo.
It's a people party.

935
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:50,058
Alas, my life story.

936
01:05:50,158 --> 01:05:53,013
And now, the First Dog,
Daisy.

937
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:58,236
Where is she?
Where is she?

938
01:05:58,336 --> 01:06:00,881
<i>Oh! There she is
- There she is</i>

939
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,864
We are pleased
to meet you, Daisy.

940
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:19,038
<i>The Kalampore
National Anthem.</i>

941
01:06:25,748 --> 01:06:27,943
She's so cute.

942
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:41,427
Hold on.

943
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,450
Yes?

944
01:06:48,549 --> 01:06:51,018
Everything's under control.

945
01:06:51,117 --> 01:06:56,894
I have something that'll make those bad oysters
I gave him in Kalampore seem like high tea.

946
01:06:56,994 --> 01:07:00,745
After tonight, there's no way
the prince will sign that agreement.

947
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:06,303
The only document
linking me to this deal...

948
01:07:06,403 --> 01:07:08,673
is locked in a safe
in my office.

949
01:07:08,772 --> 01:07:13,207
I assure you, Mr. Dunsmore,
that rain forest is history...

950
01:07:13,306 --> 01:07:16,787
and you and I are
going to be very rich.

951
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:21,916
Oh, no. Oh, no,
the chief is a rat!

952
01:07:22,016 --> 01:07:23,984
I gotta do somethin'.
I gotta tell somebody.

953
01:07:24,084 --> 01:07:27,391
<i>Oh, if only I could leave
this house, but I can't!</i>

954
01:07:27,491 --> 01:07:30,558
All right. Okay, if I leave this house,
what's the worst thing that's gonna happen?

955
01:07:30,658 --> 01:07:32,997
<i>Okay, people will think
that spring is early</i>

956
01:07:33,097 --> 01:07:36,563
<i>But I'm not the only groundhog.
It's not all on my shoulders.</i>

957
01:07:36,663 --> 01:07:39,200
<i>And the rain forest
The rain forest is at sta-</i>

958
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,173
But there are
other rain forests.

959
01:07:41,272 --> 01:07:45,216
<i>I can't stand-I've gotta go!
I'm goin'! Stand back!</i>

960
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:52,290
I did it! I'm goin'! I'm goin'!
We have nothing to fear but fear itself.

961
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,521
This is a wonderful night,
Mr. President.

962
01:07:58,621 --> 01:08:02,725
Your family is lovely. This
place, the animals- so inspiring.

963
01:08:02,824 --> 01:08:05,427
Well, I hope we managed to convey
to you how sorry we were-

964
01:08:05,527 --> 01:08:08,630
Back home we say, "However
long the night, the day will break."

965
01:08:08,729 --> 01:08:12,084
Ah.
- That is in the past. We must work to the future.

966
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:22,524
<i>Rsst Maya Maya!</i>

967
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,266
<i>Under the table</i>

968
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:36,060
Hey, you left your house. Congratulations.
What are you doin' here?

969
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:38,079
We got a big problem.

970
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:45,166
This is terrible.
Are you sure about this?

971
01:08:45,265 --> 01:08:48,246
You think that I would've left
my house if I wasn't sure?

972
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:53,640
Okay. Well, round up all the
animals. I think I have a plan.

973
01:08:53,739 --> 01:08:55,647
Oh, by the way,
can you whistle?

974
01:08:55,747 --> 01:08:59,179
Nope.

975
01:08:59,278 --> 01:09:01,349
Groundhogs talk to
each other by whistling.

976
01:09:01,449 --> 01:09:03,355
You're not a groundhog.
You're a prairie dog.

977
01:09:03,455 --> 01:09:07,341
Prairie do- Oh, no. Now
I'm having an identity crisis.

978
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:15,801
So, tell me again your
thoughts on my rain forest.

979
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:19,616
How might we come together on this issue?
- Oh, I'm so glad you asked me.

980
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:25,843
<i>Everybody understand the plan?
- Are you sure about this, Maya?</i>

981
01:09:25,943 --> 01:09:28,544
If this goes wrong, you
could get in serious trouble.

982
01:09:28,643 --> 01:09:30,611
That's just a chance
I'm gonna have to take.

983
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:32,881
<i>Okay You guys get
the evidence from the safe</i>

984
01:09:32,981 --> 01:09:35,185
I'll make sure
the president doesn't eat.

985
01:09:35,284 --> 01:09:37,521
Good luck.

986
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,836
<i>Hey, shouldn't we
synchronize our watches?</i>

987
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:55,981
Hey, where have you been?
- Oh, um, l-I'll tell you later.

988
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:11,998
<i>?Ay, Dios mo!</i>

989
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:15,406
Ha-ha!

990
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:21,661
<i>Got it!</i>

991
01:10:21,761 --> 01:10:25,584
Let's go! Shh!

992
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,455
Nothing here?

993
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:38,848
Nope.
Nothin' in here.

994
01:10:38,947 --> 01:10:43,085
Nothing here.
- Zilch-a-roonie here.

995
01:10:43,185 --> 01:10:46,300
Hey, guys. I found it!
- Ha-ha!

996
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:04,716
<i>Incoming!</i>

997
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:21,992
<i>Someone's on me tail!</i>

998
01:11:22,092 --> 01:11:24,929
<i>Watch it, buster I am
not that kind of chinchilla</i>

999
01:11:25,029 --> 01:11:29,075
<i>Shh Everyone be quiet</i>

1000
01:11:32,488 --> 01:11:34,805
<i>Monkey, where's your tail?
- Uh-oh!</i>

1001
01:11:34,905 --> 01:11:39,617
<i>Ooh, la, la</i>

1002
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:49,450
<i>Back to work, everyone!
- Go, Monkey, go!</i>

1003
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:51,836
Now, where was I?

1004
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:59,180
Ladies and gentlemen-

1005
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:06,802
First of all,
I wish to say...

1006
01:12:06,902 --> 01:12:10,174
I appreciate all that you
have done, Mr. President...

1007
01:12:10,273 --> 01:12:15,377
for the global environment and for
making this such a wonderful night.

1008
01:12:15,477 --> 01:12:18,729
<i>Thank you.</i>

1009
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:26,057
<i>And I want to
announce at this time</i>

1010
01:12:26,156 --> 01:12:28,075
I will sign the agreement.

1011
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:37,308
Your Highness,
thank you.

1012
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,607
<i>And I would like
to propose a toast</i>

1013
01:12:43,706 --> 01:12:45,610
To His Highness,
Prince Tharoor...

1014
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:48,720
and to a long and fruitful collaboration
between our two countries.

1015
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:53,647
And to President Sterling...

1016
01:12:53,747 --> 01:12:57,420
for going so far to arrange
this wonderful night.

1017
01:12:57,519 --> 01:13:01,224
You are a most generous host.
- I thank you.

1018
01:13:01,323 --> 01:13:05,007
<i>To the president.
- Cheers</i>

1019
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:08,780
And now, dinner is served.

1020
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:14,938
A little more to the left.

1021
01:13:15,038 --> 01:13:17,205
<i>A little more.
Roquito mas</i>

1022
01:13:17,305 --> 01:13:21,410
Keep going.
Keep going- Stop!

1023
01:13:21,509 --> 01:13:25,058
You're loving me for the ears
right now, aren't you?

1024
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:43,768
Stop!

1025
01:13:43,868 --> 01:13:47,549
Uh, hi, Your Highness.

1026
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:52,839
I'm sorry. Your Highness,
this is Maya Dolittle.

1027
01:13:52,939 --> 01:13:56,078
Ah! Yes, yes, yes.

1028
01:13:56,178 --> 01:14:00,586
Your father's reputation
is truly worid renowned. Mmm.

1029
01:14:00,685 --> 01:14:03,555
Thank you.

1030
01:14:03,654 --> 01:14:07,958
Oh, l-I'd-

1031
01:14:08,058 --> 01:14:11,058
Was there something
you wanted to say, Maya?

1032
01:14:11,157 --> 01:14:13,626
No. I mean, yes.

1033
01:14:13,726 --> 01:14:16,764
<i>Um, I would like
to just tell a joke</i>

1034
01:14:16,863 --> 01:14:19,468
It's an American tradition:
Joke before dinner.

1035
01:14:19,567 --> 01:14:21,507
<i>Maya-
- So</i>

1036
01:14:21,606 --> 01:14:25,639
Why do cows wear bells?

1037
01:14:25,739 --> 01:14:29,012
Because their
horns don't work!

1038
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:32,483
You get it? 'Cause the
horns go, "beep, beep"-

1039
01:14:32,583 --> 01:14:34,582
Uh-huh.

1040
01:14:34,681 --> 01:14:36,954
<i>Stop! Okay,
back to the right</i>

1041
01:14:37,053 --> 01:14:38,957
<i>The other right!</i>

1042
01:14:39,057 --> 01:14:41,859
Okay. So there
were two fish in a tank.

1043
01:14:41,959 --> 01:14:43,924
And one fish says
to the other fish...

1044
01:14:44,023 --> 01:14:46,161
"Do you know how
to drive this thing?"

1045
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:48,532
'Cause they're in a tank.
You get it? 'Cause-

1046
01:14:48,631 --> 01:14:50,597
Yeah. I really-
I love that one.

1047
01:14:50,697 --> 01:14:52,604
<i>Maya?
- Hmm?</i>

1048
01:14:52,704 --> 01:14:55,939
Thank you.
- But l-

1049
01:14:56,038 --> 01:14:58,775
Maya, thank you.

1050
01:14:58,874 --> 01:15:01,443
Yes, sir.

1051
01:15:01,542 --> 01:15:04,055
Well, folks,
let's eat.

1052
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:17,862
Mmm.

1053
01:15:17,962 --> 01:15:22,144
You okay?
- I guess so.

1054
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:27,237
Excuse me for one moment, Mr. President.
- Mmm.

1055
01:15:27,336 --> 01:15:29,741
I must confer with my adviser
about our agreement.

1056
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,589
Of course.

1057
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:44,235
To the left, and... stop! That's it.

1058
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,374
<i>Go, Rarrot, go!</i>

1059
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:51,760
<i>Gotcha.
- Ha-ha!</i>

1060
01:15:51,859 --> 01:15:53,838
Missin accomplished.

1061
01:15:56,084 --> 01:15:59,076
<i>Got it.
- Go, dog, go! Vaya con Dios.</i>

1062
01:16:05,494 --> 01:16:08,861
I feel weird.

1063
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:22,472
Wait a second. It wasn't the
president's food. It was Daisy's!

1064
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,593
<i>Get this dog off of me! Now!
- Your Highness!</i>

1065
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:53,306
You have insulted Prince Tharoor
for the last time. The deal is off!

1066
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:58,894
Your Highness, please-
- I said, the deal is off!

1067
01:16:58,993 --> 01:17:01,697
We are leaving.

1068
01:17:01,797 --> 01:17:05,602
<i>Your Highness-</i>

1069
01:17:05,702 --> 01:17:08,520
Wait! Stop!

1070
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:15,413
Chief Dorion is responsible
for everything.

1071
01:17:15,512 --> 01:17:17,511
<i>He spiked Daisy's food tonight</i>

1072
01:17:17,610 --> 01:17:20,830
and he was the one who gave the
president bad oysters in Kalampore.

1073
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:24,820
What? That's-
That's ridiculous.

1074
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:29,158
<i>This is just a sad and pathetic attempt to
cover up your own incompetence, Miss Dolittle</i>

1075
01:17:29,258 --> 01:17:32,428
Secret Service, get her out of here.
- Harold, let's hear her out.

1076
01:17:32,527 --> 01:17:35,433
Sir, really, l-
- Harold.

1077
01:17:35,533 --> 01:17:38,998
He doesn't want you and the prince
to sign the agreement.

1078
01:17:39,098 --> 01:17:41,539
He's been trying to sabotage
the entire thing.

1079
01:17:41,639 --> 01:17:44,171
That's preposterous.
- It's the truth!

1080
01:17:44,271 --> 01:17:49,614
The groundhog overheard you on your cell phone tonight.
- The groundhog?

1081
01:17:49,713 --> 01:17:53,146
Well, he's a prairie dog
who thinks he's a groundhog.

1082
01:17:53,245 --> 01:17:57,988
So, your alleged proof
of this outrageous story...

1083
01:17:58,087 --> 01:18:01,907
is the word of a prairie dog
who thinks he's a groundhog?

1084
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:05,196
<i>Secret Service, please</i>

1085
01:18:05,296 --> 01:18:08,396
Maya.

1086
01:18:08,495 --> 01:18:10,508
I'm sorry I disappointed you,
Mr. President.

1087
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:18,073
<i>Woof! Woof! Beg your
pardon Dog savin'the day</i>

1088
01:18:18,173 --> 01:18:20,708
Comin' through. Make way.
Great dress, lady.

1089
01:18:20,808 --> 01:18:23,230
<i>Comin'through here
- Come on.</i>

1090
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:29,563
Sorry about the saliva.

1091
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:36,089
Hmm. Actually, it's the word
of a prairie dog...

1092
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:38,096
and... these.

1093
01:18:38,196 --> 01:18:42,196
These documents show that
Chief Dorion is a silent partner...

1094
01:18:42,295 --> 01:18:44,432
in Boyd and Dunsmore
Investment Group.

1095
01:18:44,532 --> 01:18:50,014
<i>And he stands to make millions
if the rain forest is developed</i>

1096
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:54,445
Where did you get
those documents?

1097
01:18:54,545 --> 01:18:59,626
Harold, I would get
a very expensive lawyer.

1098
01:19:00,635 --> 01:19:02,762
I never did
like that man.

1099
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:09,202
<i>The only thing I hate more
than animals is teenagers!</i>

1100
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:19,801
<i>Miss Dolittle,
I cannot thank you enough</i>

1101
01:19:19,901 --> 01:19:23,640
<i>You have brought the people of
Kalampore and United States together</i>

1102
01:19:23,739 --> 01:19:27,943
You are truly a hero.
- Thank you.

1103
01:19:28,043 --> 01:19:30,313
I wanted to change the worid
before I was 30.

1104
01:19:30,412 --> 01:19:32,749
She's changed it
before she's even 20.

1105
01:19:32,849 --> 01:19:34,915
You were so brave.

1106
01:19:35,015 --> 01:19:37,904
I barely got out with my life,
but it was worth it.

1107
01:19:40,542 --> 01:19:42,407
Who has got a pen?

1108
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:48,127
We have an agreement to sign.

1109
01:19:48,226 --> 01:19:51,265
<i>Way to go, Maya!</i>

1110
01:19:51,364 --> 01:19:53,637
<i>Maya, you did it!</i>

1111
01:19:53,736 --> 01:19:56,804
We gotta kick this party up a notch.
- Leave it to the Monkey.

1112
01:19:56,904 --> 01:19:59,087
It's funky monkey time.

1113
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:02,626
<i>Everybody get down!</i>

1114
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:08,851

Well, I'll be.

1140
01:21:55,154 --> 01:21:57,134
Huh.

1141
01:22:02,217 --> 01:22:05,550
"The president
of the United States"-

1142
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,072
<i>It may look like
just another perfect day</i>

1143
