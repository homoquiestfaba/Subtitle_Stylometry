00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,470
MAN: I've been working for most
of the year in this big house in London.

2
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,480
I'm on the door.

3
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,910
It belongs to Elliot Graham,

4
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,310
who, in the list of the richest people
in Britain, was number eight.

5
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,910
Nobody lives here now.

6
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,680
Mr Graham himself lives across
the street, in number 3 1.

7
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,150
All that happens in this house
is that it's cleaned, every day,

8
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,880
and people arrange flowers here.

9
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,230
There is always fresh flowers.

10
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,025
And then, when the cleaners all leave,
I'm alone here.

11
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,205
From between six and nine,
I am by myself.

12
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,510
Well, until the security guard turns up.

13
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,354
I have this whole place to myself.
Every day.

14
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,470
I'm not allowed to let anybody in,

15
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,270
not permitted to open the front door
to any stranger.

16
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,830
I never break this rule, ever.

17
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,460
Not without Mr Graham 's
personal permission.

18
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,425
But yesterday I did break it.

19
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,670
The house
shouldn't have been empty then.

20
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,525
It was only ten to three,
but the cleaners had left early.

21
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,040
I really don't know
why I broke the rule.

22
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,360
It was just something about her.

23
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,110
Yeah?

24
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,120

25
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,545
She don't work here any more.

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,998
Right. I see.

27
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,230
I spoke to her on the phone
a little while ago, and she was

28
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,750
and she was kind enough to say if I was
passing and would like to look inside,

29
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,950
I should just ring the bell.
And today I was passing.

30
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,870
No, she stopped working here
two weeks ago.

31
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,880
I'll go, then.

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,375

-Can you?

-I mean, apart from the door?
-No.

No, nothing, nothing I need to see.

No, I was just passing,
as I said, I thought it would be

after all this time.

No, no, gosh, that won't be necessary.

YOUNG MARY: A month ago,
regular readers of this column

149
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,590
will remember I advocated
a little more passion

150
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,390
in our native cinema,

151
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,030
that perhaps physical love
was not best expressed

152
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,430
by a small peck
on our jaunty hero's cheek

153
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,110

154
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,190
as he sets off
for work in the morning whistling.

155
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,590
I also ventured the thought
that it was important

156
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,590
that audiences were treated as adults,
and therefore

157
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,150
sexual love was clearly
a proper subject for cinema.

158
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,750
And that, ultimately,
we might see some representation

159
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,755
of the actual sexual act
in mainstream pictures.

160
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,877

saying there should be more sex

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
The funny thing is,

175
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,070
the person I found most interesting
wasn't one of the living legends.

176
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,310
I found myself

177
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,630
becoming really fascinated by this man
who wasn't at all famous.

178
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,720
In fact, nobody there
was quite sure what he did.

179
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,350
I noticed people seemed
a little nervous when he approached,

180
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
even Alfred Hitchcock.

181
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,790
And then I began to understand why,

182
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,950
when I managed to eavesdrop
on what he was saying.

183
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,910
He would whisper to these great writers
and movie directors and actors,

184
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,276
"Your latest

185
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,375
"doesn't seem to have caused
quite such a stir as your last.

186
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,525
"It's still on, isn't it?

187
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,630
"Well, I don't know, I liked it.
I don't know why I'm so alone."

188
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,070
You must be so relieved.

189
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,230
People seem to be going
despite the notices.

190
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,629
He seemed to weave a web

191
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,514
round these famous people.

192
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,950
I think people are just
a little confused, that's what I think.

193
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,112
But it won't have done you any harm,
will it?

194
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,310
People said he was in publishing.

195
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,910
That as a very young man he'd worked
for Lloyd George on his papers,

196
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,710
getting them in order.

197
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,715
Now he was doing the same
for Winston Churchill.

198
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,470
He was very friendly with the great
newspaper proprietors of the time.

199
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,029
So he knew everyone who mattered.

200
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,510
He was one of those mysterious people

201
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,832
who seem to do
both everything and nothing.

202
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,435
(PING-PONG BALL BOUNCING)

203
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,270
Sometimes,

204
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,785
I would see him thrash this ball about
in the passage.

205
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,940
People said he knew so many secrets,

206
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,880
but he never ever disclosed
what he knew.

207
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,910
The other extraordinary thing he did,

208
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,310
he brought
these extremely young girls with him.

209
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,470
Gorgeous young things,
but definitely underage.

210
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,350
On my fourth visit,

211
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,185
there was
this particularly glorious creature.

212
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,950
I don't know how he introduced her.
His niece? Friend of the family?

213
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,560
I'd never spoken to him.

214
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Not yet.

215
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,030
Occasionally, I would
see him glance towards me

216
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,250
in a slightly knowing way.

217
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,236
And on this evening,
he was getting closer and closer.

218
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,234
Phyllis, how are you?

219
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,340
MARY: I felt myself getting excited.

220
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,190
More excited, absurdly,

221
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,470
than if Alfred Hitchcock
had been coming to talk to me.

222
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
What did he say?

223
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
-Oh, sorry.
-Sorry.

224
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,150
MARY: I'd just gone into the kitchen
to get a glass of water.

225
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,900
It seemed absurd
to ask a servant to do that.

226
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,595
-I' m not disturbing you, am I?
-No, no, of course, not.

227
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,150
Both of us have escaped to the kitchen.

228
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,910
No, I just came
to get myself some water.

229
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,830
Right.

230
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,710
Well, as for me,
I'm really going to shock you, I think.

231
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,350
-Oh, are you? I doubt that.
-I've come here to make myself a salad.

232
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,430
(LAUGHING)

233
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,990
I have.

234
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,550
One of my little foibles
when it gets late.

235
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,550
The staff leave me the ingredients
and I make myself a salad.

236
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,990
-Does that shock you?
-No, of course not.

237
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,510
It is a little eccentric, I admit.

238
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,190
-I haven't introduced myself, I'm...
-It is me who has to introduce himself.

239
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,550
I'm Greville White.

240
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,630
I know, of course, who you are,
Mary Gilbert, because you are famous.

241
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,633
-Oh, no, hardly.
-Absolutely. You are.

242
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,230
I hang on your every word.
I can quote whole paragraphs.

243
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,390
You're an "acid observer",
isn't that right?

244
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,830
Slicing people down to size?
I do a bit of that, too, I suppose,

245
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,350
though, of course,
I don't write it down.

246
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,510
-But I know a few things.
-I bet you do.

247
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,310
"The Voice of Youth",
isn't that what it says?

248
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,430
Oh, please...

249
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,870
Your by-line in the newspaper,
"The True Voice of Youth"?

250
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,870
That was awful. I stopped them doing it.

251
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,030
What a fantastic opportunity
that is, though,

252
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,235
to be the voice of youth.

253
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,230
-I would grab it if I were you.
-I'm trying to.

254
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,590
You know, one thing I often do...
Well, "often" is a lie,

255
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,530
one thing I occasionally do
is see myself as others see me.

256
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,835
Quite vividly, in fact.

257
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:30,990
-Do you ever do that?
-No.

258
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,310
You sure?

259
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,465
I'm not certain I know what you mean.

260
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,470
I'll tell you exactly what I mean.

261
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,690
When I think about myself,

262
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,675
most of the time I see myself as dapper.

263
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,750
And maybe I've got a little more energy
than some other people.

264
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,670
You have that, too, Mary.

265
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,750
And I've got a good memory
and a reasonably lively mind,

266
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,399
that's how I see myself.

267
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,830
But sometimes

268
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,710
I conjure up the picture
other people have of me,

269
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
what they see.

270
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,590
They see me as quite a slimy,
maybe treacherous fellow, sweaty,

271
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,670
always with little beads of sweat
on his brow,

272
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,350
as if I'm working too hard
to be charming,

273
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,375
covering what's really going on inside
and the effort shows.

274
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,325
Whatever the temperature of the room,
whatever the season,

275
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,960
they see the sweat.

276
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,510
Don't worry, a little party trick.

277
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,750
Hopefully not too many people
see me like that.

278
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,310
-I'm sure they don't.
-Come on.

279
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,790
No need to be bland with me,
Mary Gilbert,

280
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,950
that's not what you're famous for.

281
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,110
I'm quite certain you, for a start,
have viewed me like that.

282
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,790
-No, I'm sure I haven't.
-Don't worry.

283
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,690
I'm not offended in the slightest.

284
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,405
-I can tell you, Mr White, I...
-Please, Greville.

285
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Please, Bernard.

286
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,465
I promise you,
I really promise you, I'm not offended.

287
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,110
And what's more,
I'm going to prove it to you.

288
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,190
Now.

289
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,040
-Prove it to me?
-By doing something I never normally do.

290
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,990
Telling you a few little things
that might amuse you,

291
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,037
since you are an observer yourself.

292
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,990
I never gossip as a rule...

293
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,468
-I'd heard.
-Oh,

294
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,711
so you do know something about me.

295
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,794
-I'd heard that.
-Yes, well, I never ever gossip.

296
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,630
I mean, too many useful things
would be compromised if I did.

297
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,518
But for you, young Mary Gilbert,

298
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,909
I will make an exception.

299
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,600
My only exception.

300
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,038
He told me a few little titbits.

301
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,710
A famous politician who was having
an affair with a minor royal

302
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,035
was probably the only juicy revelation.

303
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,030
Yet they were mostly mild,
harmless stories,

304
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,670
like a civil servant
who had an obsessive need

305
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,990
to pick people's pockets.

306
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,110
Not just watches and wallets,
but sometimes people's cough lozenges.

307
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,095
(CHUCKLING) There was a funny story

308
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,828
about a famous Hollywood star

309
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,750
who'd come over to England
to make a film and she was terrified

310
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,630
of Pekingese dogs,
regarded seeing them as a terrible omen.

311
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,670
So if she caught sight of one
on her way to the film studios

312
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,310
in the morning,
she would refuse to film that day.

313
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,505
So the film company was reduced
to hiring special dog walkers,

314
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,028
all with great big dogs,
to amble through the streets

315
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,710
near her hotel each time
she set off in the morning.

316
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,310
I met her once.

317
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,350
Apart from the business with dogs,
she was rather nice.

318
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,030
She swore an awful lot.
She had a charming Southern accent.

319
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,431
It was fascinating,
being deluged with gossip

320
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,270
while he made his healthy-looking salad.

321
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,750
He was funny and charming.

322
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,430
But I had no doubt, as I watched him,

323
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,230
I was under no illusion that,
though I was quite well-known then

324
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,836
and nobody outside the elite circle
knew who he was,

325
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,590
here was someone
who was far more powerful than me.

326
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,070
He does a jolly good haircut.

327
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,190
MARY: Someone I had to be
extremely careful of.

328
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,310
I've had mine done by him
more than once.

329
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,740
-Oh, does he charge as well?
-No, quite the opposite.

330
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,310
You get a glass of sherry
and some cheese biscuits.

331
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,870
Why is he telling me all this?

332
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,630
He's more than just trying
to get me into bed.

333
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
What's he really after?

334
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,190
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to see where it happened.

335
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,835
-Are you coming?
-Do we have to?

336
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,796
-Well, what do you think?
-It looks terrific.

337
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,792
It's hardly changed.
Well, that's terrible.

338
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,713
It's like it's been preserved.

339
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,775
-It should have changed more.
-Yeah.

340
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,585
Did you get to eat his salad?

341
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,110
It's funny you should ask that,
I was just thinking that very second,

342
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,160
I never got to taste it.

343
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,120
It is beautiful, isn't it? You're right.

344
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,393
-Yes.
-Thank you. And it is just for us two.

345
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,433
Just for us?

346
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,230
We'll never finish it.

347
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,990
Shall we go
and choose some wine to go with it?

348
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,790
-Oh, oh, you mean...
-From the cellar.

349
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,110
-The cellar?
-Yes, I often do that.

350
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,990
Mr Graham has a fantastic wine cellar,

351
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,190
though I'm not sure
he knows his way round it.

352
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,590
He frequently asks me
for recommendations,

353
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,550
and he lets me take a bottle home,
when I wish. One of my little perks.

354
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,395
Do you want to come and help me choose?

355
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,990
Ever written about wine?

356
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,190
No. I know absolutely nothing
about wine.

357
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,310
So, there are some things
you don't have an opinion on, then?

358
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,830
Of course.

359
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,310
There are all sorts of things
I don't know anything about, naturally.

360
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,070
Really? I can't believe
that's true, Mary.

361
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,469
Well, it is.

362
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,670
I see myself very much
as a beginner still.

363
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,550
I've been very lucky in my career.

364
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,980
It's good to have strong opinions.
I approve of that.

365
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,950
MARY: I realised he was most probably
trying to seduce me,

366
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,230
but, I don't know why,
I wasn't the least afraid of him.

367
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,640
I knew he wasn't going to
try to rape me.

368
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,630
And I knew

369
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,310
instinctively there was something else
he wanted to tell me.

370
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,015
And, of course, a bit of me was thinking
maybe there's a story here.

371
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,358
Up until 20 years ago,

372
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,030
the food used to come along here
from the kitchens.

373
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,040
Can you believe that?

374
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,390
I know it seems spooky down here,
but it isn't.

375
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,145
-It is, in fact, rather beautiful.
-Beautiful?

376
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,914
Maybe. In a way.

377
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,794
Isn't this magnificent?

378
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,110
Yes, it is.

379
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,670
Some of these bottles
are over a hundred years old.

380
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,150
Mr Graham bought up
other people's wine collections

381
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,285
and stuck them down here.

382
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,510
There are some real treasures
that are worth a fortune.

383
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,110
I persuaded him recently
to do some better labelling.

384
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,873
I wrote some of these myself.

385
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,428
-Great labels.
-Thanks.

386
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,080
Yes, they are rather nice.

387
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,455
-You know about films?
-Yes.

388
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,550
Well, this is a bit like something
in that fat chap upstairs' movie,

389
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,390
you know, Notorious,
where they go down to the wine cellar.

390
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,070
Cary Grant, you don't know
what he's going to discover,

391
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,310
and then Ingrid Bergman joins him.

392
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,670
Well, I'm not sure
we're going to find some uranium

393
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,570
down here in one of these bottles.

394
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,725
-And that's what Cary Grant found.
-No. Maybe not.

395
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,060
And here we have this.
We have a Chateau Latour 1900,

396
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,630
one of the greatest wines
of the century.

397
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,830
And little did they know,
as they were drinking this

398
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,950
what a great disaster
was going to overcome them all,

399
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,955
the fighting, the trenches,
in just a few years.

400
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,350
I like doing this,

401
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,750
imaging what was happening
as certain wines were bottled.

402
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,470
A Chateau Haut Brion,
often described as a very feminine wine.

403
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,830
I mean, 1929 was a truly great year.

404
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,630
Just as the stock markets of the world
were collapsing

405
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,310
and people were throwing
themselves out of buildings.

406
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,914
Exactly. And come here.

407
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,630
1943, the best vintage during the war.

408
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,070
I mean, the connoisseur's life
very definitely didn't stop, you see.

409
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,594
You do know a lot about wine.

410
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,470
Well, I spend an awful lot of my time
in country houses

411
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,795
drinking the stuff, as I help them out.

412
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,990
Well, I wouldn't complain if I were you,
it's a nice way to spend your time.

413
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Was I complaining?

414
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,520
I didn't mean to.

415
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
There's more.

416
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,390
Shall we, uh...
Shall we choose a bottle, then?

417
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,950
Maybe the one that's worth a fortune,
that would surprise them.

418
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,720
If we went upstairs waving that around,
having opened it.

419
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
I lied to you.

420
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
About what?

421
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,310
-The reason for us coming down here?
-No.

422
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,118
What do you take me for, Mary?

423
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,030
I don't normally lure young women down
into cellars to take advantage of them.

424
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,110
No, I lied about the stories I told you.

425
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,830
You mean they weren't true?

426
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,110
No, they were true all right,
but they were

427
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,078
silly, unimportant froth.

428
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,250
They weren't the real story, Mary.

429
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,805
I should have been more truthful.

430
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,920
Do you want to hear
the real story, Mary?

431
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,380
As he said that,
I could feel myself go cold.

432
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,359
Do you want to hear that?
The real story, Mary?

433
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Yes.

434
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Right.

435
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,625
And then he tells me a series

436
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,630
of what I can only call

437
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,520
horrific things.

438
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,428
He was very calm, very specific,

439
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,868
the year, the exact location

440
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,396
and, of course, all the real names.

441
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,585
At first I thought I could handle it.

442
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:01,317
It started with something fairly nasty,
but it was not unbearable.

443
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,510
About an archbishop

444
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:09,958
who thrashed little boys
till they bled and were raw.

445
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,630
Continued even when
he was a famous prelate.

446
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,190
He thrashed and thrashed them.

447
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,516
And then he moved on
to a famous public figure

448
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,990
who had apparently kept a young woman
like a slave in his house.

449
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,390
Degraded her in the most
horrible fashion, for year after year.

450
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,905
When it was over,
her own sister didn't recognise her.

451
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,278
There was a story
that particularly shocked me,

452
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:51,580
one he himself had directly witnessed
about a very senior politician,

453
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,070
somebody who had helped
lead us through the war,

454
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,514
watching a documentary

455
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,430
about the Holocaust and coming out
afterwards and saying to Greville...

456
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,752
"The fucking Jews,
they were really asking for it."

457
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,030
That's what he said to me, Mary.

458
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,430
-That's... That's terrible.
-Yes.

459
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,900
He seemed very surprised when
I went rather quiet after he'd said it.

460
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,115
MARY: There were stories
of cruelty to children.

461
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,030
There were one or two things

462
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:31,750
so disgusting I've never been able to
get them out of my head.

463
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,945
I find myself thinking about them
nearly every week, even now.

464
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,672
Everything he told me was sordid,

465
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,878
and sometimes unbearably sad, too.

466
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,154
And I believed every word.

467
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,370
I don't think he was making it up.

468
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,395
In fact, I know he wasn't making it up.

469
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,510
I mean, I know

470
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,870
there are stories you can tell
about the powerful in any age,

471
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,919
I'm sure you could collect
awful things now,

472
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,518
but hearing them pour out, all together,
coming right at me.

473
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,355
It took me totally by surprise.

474
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,869
I liked to think of myself

475
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,672
as being
very sophisticated, unshockable.

476
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,389
But he really shocked me.

477
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
Nice life I lead.

478
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,710
There is a line of cruelty, Mary,
that I've watched personally,

479
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,510
running from before the war
right through to where we are now.

480
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,110
I think I'm a great witness,
the many things I've seen.

481
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,290
It's just I can never tell people.

482
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,140
-Well, why are you telling me?
-I don't know.

483
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,190
I really don't know
the answer to that, Mary.

484
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,515
Maybe you seemed a good person to tell.

485
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,840
The voice of youth.

486
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,950
And also perhaps
I wanted to tell you because...

487
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,870
-I wanted to show you something.
-Show me what?

488
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,470
Show you that even though
I know all these things,

489
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,590
and in one or two instances

490
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,950
have actually been in the house
when they happened,

491
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,396
I still believe
the alternative is worse.

492
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,230
What's the alternative?

493
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,350
Reducing everybody
and everything to the same level.

494
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,989
Letting the great unwashed
run everything.

495
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,471
And suddenly, he's all bright
and argumentative.

496
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,670
Do you agree with me, Mary?

497
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,835
As if after telling me
all these disgusting things

498
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,790
none of it mattered,

499
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,190
as if all he wanted was a little

500
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,557
dinner party political ding dong,
to take me on.

501
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
What's your view, Mary?

502
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,433
You're going to run away now,
aren't you?

503
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,510
-I think I'd better leave, don't you?
-No, I don't think you should leave.

504
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,520
Well, I'm going to.

505
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,085
We haven't chosen our bottle yet.

506
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,280
No, we haven't.

507
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,914
No, of course,
everything you've told me...

508
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,570
-Yes?
-Will remain completely confidential.

509
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,753
-Naturally.
-I won't breathe a word.

510
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,260
-Do I really believe that?
-Yes. You do believe that.

511
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,610
-If that is what you promise, Mary.
-That's what I promise.

512
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,910
Oh, it still looks creepy,
even with all this light on.

513
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,260
I suppose most basements are creepy.

514
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,870
Yeah, I've never seen a rat down here,
so it must be clean.

515
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
Oh, don't!

516
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,390
I suppose so little goes on
in the house now,

517
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,205
there's not much for them to eat.

518
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,110
All the wine, it's still here.

00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,076
-Nobody drinks it?
-No.

00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,390
You're thinking I should never have

521
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,110
come down here with him,
aren't you, Joe?

522
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,190
I weren't thinking that.

523
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,680
Would you have said no?

524
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,280
No, I don't think so.

526
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,630
MARY: I told myself
I would let everything go,

527
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,270
you know, let it wash away,

528
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,870
that by the time
I got home it would be gone.

529
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,310
Of course, within minutes of me
sitting there,

530
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,150
I realised
that wasn't going to happen because,

531
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,390
as soon as I was alone with my thoughts,

532
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,140
everything he told me
became even more vivid.

533
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,550
For some reason,
I started seeing this newsreel footage,

534
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,790
and I was thinking
all these things he's told me

535

MARY: And then something else
dawned on me.

539
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,158
Because he'd been so specific,
every date,

540
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,869
every name,
people that were still alive,

541
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,530
when he came back into the room,
I realised

542
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,314
he's told me all these things which
he might not have told anybody else,

543
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,225
so he's not going to
let go of me that easily.

544
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,575
Just running away from him in the cellar
isn't going to finish the business.

Let' s get out of here, Joe.

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,350
I need you to lead me, Joe, I don't
know my way out of this bloody place.

547
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,319
-Oh, well, it' s this way.
-Oh, thank you.

548
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,170
Oh, that's better, Joe, thank you.

549
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,195
I was just keeping out the winter cold.

550
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,470
Did you get away from him?
Away from this man?

551
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,285
Well, that was my intention, Joe,

552
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,345
and for that to be possible,
I knew I needed to see him again.

553
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,912
I would act so vague when I saw him,

554
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,850
so forgetful,
he'll realise he has no hold over me.

555
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,410
I mean, I knew he could still do me
professional harm, if he chose.

556
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,956
It was the first time

557
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,040
I'd been invited
to spend the night here.

558
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,910
We'd been to Wimbledon
to see the tennis.

559
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,270
In the morning,
we were going down the river.

560
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,990
As always,
there was a small group of guests,

561
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,210
they were all very famous,

but no Greville White.

00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:45,830
Mr Graham's theme for the evening
seemed to be Edwardian Music Hall.

564

with these old songs.

I remember.

00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:12,790
I'd just been given
an important assignment,

571
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,520
a series of articles in America.

572
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,750
It would be my first visit there.

573
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,830
# Still the clock kept the time

574
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,230

thank you.

to do a few articles out there.

00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,870
-How wonderful.
-Yes, a fantastic opportunity.

581
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,270
I'm only going for a short time,
but I'm very excited.

I've just got something here for you.

I thought you might like
some strawberries.

00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,870
I missed the tennis,
but I brought the strawberries.

603

It's clotted cream, do you want some?

00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,125
Thank you, that's very kind.
I'll have a spoonful.

-Thank you. I am.

about the last time we saw each other...

608

Oh, yes, when you made that big salad.

609

Yes, there was the salad.

Oh, yes, was it something...
Was it about a film star and dogs?

Yes, that was part of it,
amongst other things.

why I told you those things...

-No, no, you don't have to.
-Please.

over-sweet Greek puddings,

with names like "galaktoboureko",
and they were so sticky.

to unstick ourselves,

very senior figures in the government,

640
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,590
"You know how I hate niggers,

00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,750
"but we are going to have to give them
something, especially in Africa."

642
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,190
And somebody else was saying,

643
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,870
"The niggers will never be able to
run anything. It's madness."

644
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,190
I mean, it was very standard stuff,
but as they talked,

645
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,190
they were all fiddling with their teeth.

646
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,855
Their mouths were literally
being gummed up.

647
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,790
Why are you telling me this?

648
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,950
Well, I thought you'd like that image,
these men sitting around,

649
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,870
"I hate the niggers,"
all this syrup in their mouths.

00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,269
And did you agree with them?

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,085
I didn't say that, did I?

00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,390

-Of course.

I want to give you.

00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,193
-No, no, it's late, and I really...
-Please.

656
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,190
Just let me for a moment.
I know you think I'm a snob, Mary...

657
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,830
I really don't know
what you think or believe and I...

658
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,356
-I don't need to know.
-I like taste, refinement.

659
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,310
I really value that.
I don't think that's a crime.

660
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,950
And the idea of everything
being reduced to total mediocrity,

661
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,070
to the lowest common denominator,
that does terrify me.

662
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,470
-I hate the common herd.
-So, you must hate me then, mustn't you?

663
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,630
Because that's where I'm from.

664
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,060
You really imagine I'd be here
if that's what I felt?

665
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,350
Is that what you think of me, Mary?

666
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,830
I'd be really disappointed
if that's what you thought of me.

667

MARY: I had my chance then.

668
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,670
I could tell him
what I thought of him now.

669
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,110
I so wish
I could have found the words, Joe.

670
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,750
I often think of that moment,

671
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,870
imagine it again, in my head,
and when I do that,

672
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,510
I really demolish him.
I'm incredibly eloquent.

673
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,590
But I was a very young woman,

674
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,870
and there was this older man
playing some strange game with me.

675
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,833
I don't think I did too badly.

676
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,070
You want to know
what I think of you, Greville?

677
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,713
Well, I think you're a bit sad.

678
00:50:36,723 --> 00:50:39,712
Sad? In what way?

679
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,870
For some reason, you see me as a threat.

680
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,150
You know, a threat to your nice life
and your country houses.

681
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,030
Why on earth you should think that,
I don't know.

682
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,353
You know, maybe it's because I'm young,

683
00:50:53,363 --> 00:50:55,360
and a woman, of course,

684
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,710
and you think I don't show
enough respect or something.

685
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,035
And you want to stop me being a threat.

686
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,550
And that's rather sad, don't you think?

687
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:11,385
Spending so much energy
over somebody like me.

688
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:22,195
Thank you for the strawberries and um...
and good night.

689
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,640
Right.

690
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,855
If that is what you feel,
you probably won't want this then.

691
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,430
-But I really would urge you to take it.
-I don't want it, whatever it is.

692
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,520
Please, look inside,
and then I'll go, I promise.

693
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,990
What is this?
The key to the wine cellar?

694
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,230
It's the key to my house.

695
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,830
To your house?

696
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,350
Yes, and it doesn't mean
what you think it does.

697
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,870
No, whatever it means, I don't want it.

698
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,620
And this isn't a trick
or some cheap gesture.

699
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:14,030
I want you to have the imagination
to accept it, the key to my house.

700
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:19,950
You can come there whenever you want.
You can visit just once or many times.

701
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,599
Just drop by, let yourself in,

702
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,672
either alone or with a friend.

703
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,150
Why on earth would I want to do that?

704
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,750
There are all sorts of things
in that house

705
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,990
that I've collected over many years,
over my whole life!

706
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,950
If I happen to be there
when you come by,

707
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,340
I wouldn't try to touch you.

708
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,195
I would never attempt to be your lover.

709
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,590
Greville, that really is too strange.

710
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,935
I really would urge you
not to refuse straight away.

711
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,310
How many of these do you hand out
to girls each season?

712
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,995
That is unkind, Mary.
I had that specially made for you.

713
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,645
And you won't believe me,
but I've never done this before.

714
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,150
-I thought we might help each other.
-Help each other?

715
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,590
-In what way?
-In all sorts of ways.

716
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,680
-What does that mean?
-Professionally, of course.

717
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,725
That goes without saying.

718
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,800
And in other ways, too.

719
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,710
-Help each other understand the world.
-Good night, Greville.

720
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,710
Don't give it back to me now,
think about it overnight at least.

721
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,720
I've thought about it.

722
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:58,870
He didn't come bursting back in, did he?

723
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,030
Or he didn't knock the door down,
come rushing at you?

724
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,780
No. No, Joe,
he was a bit cleverer than that.

725
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,700
I can still feel that night.

726
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,520
How warm it was.

727
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,350
How good I felt in that dress.

728
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,910
But I was bloody nervous
after he'd gone,

729
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
with that creepy key.

730
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,875
I thought, I'll leave very early,

731
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,433
get away from this house,
get on with my life.

732
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,520
Never come back.

733
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
WOMAN: Hello, Mary.

734
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,870
I've got a letter for you.

735
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,880
-A letter for me?
-Yes.

736
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,080
From Greville.

737
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,275
-It's very early.
-Yes, it is, isn't it?

738
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,476
Sometimes I love to get up early.

739
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,300
I don't think
we've been properly introduced.

740
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,675
-I'm Mary Gilbert.
-And I'm Liza Henton.

741
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,916
There, now we've done it properly.

742
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,990
She looked so beautiful
I couldn't help thinking,

743
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,710
"Does he have sex with this girl? "

744
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,430
Does he keep several of them
in his house?

745
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,775
I mean, did it all start
with them being given keys?

746
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,710
-Thank you.
-He said that you should read it now,

747
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,670
and that I should wait to see
if there was a reply.

748
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:21,120
-I'll read it when I get home.
-He said if you could open it now.

749
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,430
And then, I suddenly thought,

750
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,270
what if it's the key again
and I have accepted it,

751
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,280
you know, unwittingly?

752
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,975
Why don't you just open it?

753
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,655
-No need to be nervous.
-No.

754
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,315
I assure you, I am not nervous.

755
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,150
GREVILLE: My dear Mary,
you disappointed me last night.

756
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,430
You should have taken the key.

757
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,150
Liza has handed you this letter,
and just look at her.

758
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,950
Does she appear in any way
frightened of me?

759
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,510
Why don't you ask her about me?

760
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,390
Please come out for dinner
with me tonight,

761
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,590
so we can settle our differences,
and part friends.

762
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,850
It would be a much better way for us
to end things.

763
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,670
Thank you for waiting. There' s no reply.

764
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,680
-No reply at all?
-No.

765
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
(DOOR SLAMMING)

766
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,030
MARY: For a few days
nothing at all happened.

767
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,505
I thought I'd got rid of him.

768
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,340
Life was going on as normal.

769
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,715
But then my trip to America
was cancelled.

770
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,030
They said to me, my bosses,

771
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,590
they'd decided
the timing wasn't quite right.

772
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,850
And a few months later,
my contract wasn't renewed.

773
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:17,550
I was told my style of journalism,

774
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:22,150
you know, the voice of youth,
was no longer in fashion.

775
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,030
I mean, I wasn't too disturbed.

776
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,310
I felt I could get a job
on any national newspaper

777
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,615
after the success I had but

778
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:37,230
one by one, for a whole variety
of reasons, they said no.

779
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,980
I heard that I was meant to be
very difficult

780
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,080
and unreliable

781
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,120
and greedy!

782
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,436
I realised Greville was behind it,
of course.

783
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,470
He was friendly
with the newspaper proprietors

784
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,390
and knew a lot
about their personal lives, too.

785
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,230
Well, didn't you find Greville,
make him do something, or...

786
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,437
No, I didn't, Joe.

787
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,580
I just thought, well, what the hell?

788
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,370
I've saved a little money,

789
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,590
I need a break, you know,
I'll go abroad...

790
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,600
Travel.

791
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,600
And write another book.

792
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,240
And I did travel, Joe.

793
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,605
I had a few love affairs,

794
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,510
one of which was great fun,
but I wasn't doing much writing.

795
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:38,195
So, one day, I decided to come home.

796
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,520
And I came back here.

797
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:09,918
I was going out with a young painter
at that time,

798
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,152
and he'd become very fashionable,

799
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,993
and he was invited by Mr Graham,

800
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,070
and my lover said to me, you know,
"Why don't you come? "

801
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,080
And I thought, why not?

802
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,310
If Greville happens to be there,

803
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,630
which seems highly unlikely
after all this time,

804
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,390
I mean, what can he do to me now?

805
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,400
He can do nothing.

806
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,190
And I thought, you know,
maybe I could d o something to him.

807
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:47,555
Be devastating, you know, be witty,
reduce him to a little heap.

808
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,756
It's so different!

809
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,790
MARY: Mr Graham had torn out
the beautiful conservatory

810
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,590
and built this horrible modern room,

811
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,830
you know, in an attempt to be with it.

812
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,470
-Hello, how are you?
-WOMAN: I' m okay, how are you?

813
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,630
Yeah, I' m fine actually.

814
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,550
MAN: You know, she used to write
some really racy stuff, didn't you?

815
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,550
-What do you mean, "used to"?
-And some quite heavy stuff, too.

816
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:24,350
-She can really write, this one.
-Oh, that's good to know!

817
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,950
-See you in a while.
-Okay. Speak to you later.

818
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,830
-WOMAN: Where have you been?
-Oh, I've been abroad.

819
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,030
In the sun, you know, working,
of course, writing and planning.

820
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,350
WOMAN: And what have you been planning?

821
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:39,355
Well, I'm planning
a trilogy of books about now.

822
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,470
-And what is the title of the books?
-The title, well...

823
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,390
I think the title will definitely
have the word "change" in it,

824
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,910
something about change.
Or else, I was thinking...

825
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,725
And there he was. Quite suddenly.

826
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,910
Right there,

827
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,335
all trussed up in a waistcoat,
though it was summer.

828
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:03,155
He seemed like he was from another age,

829
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,360
like one of his wines.

830
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,990
Trying to weave his spell
as he worked the room.

831
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,430
And soon we will be nostalgic
for glamour again,

832
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:17,510
long dresses and the funny old
conservatory that used to be here.

833
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:23,385
You don't see faces coming towards you
any more, just an army of legs.

834
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,230
It's the same with these new movies.

835
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,030
People don't want their noses
rubbed along the kitchen floor.

836
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,550
Who is that guy?

837
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:36,310
Oh, that's just somebody
I used to know a long time ago.

838
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:40,400
We once nearly shared a salad
in this very house.

839
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,310
And we...

840
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,890
We did eat
some strawberries together, too.

841
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,720
With clotted cream.

842
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,330
Squalid piece of work.
I thought it was depressing.

843
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:09,110
Oh, God!
Oh, God, it is an ugly room, isn't it?

844
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,350
Didn't you go up to him at this party?
Didn't you say something?

845
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,750
You should have got hold of him,
yanked him in front of people.

846
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,990
Did you do that?

847
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,670
Did you say, "You fucking prick!

848
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,670
"You done this to me,
now you fucking do something about it

849
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:23,910
"and get me my job back!"

850
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,549
-I didn't say that, Joe, no.
-You didn't?

851
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,670
-I couldn't.
-Well, why not?

852
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,150
Don't get impatient with me,
Joe, please.

853
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,516
Sorry. I didn't mean to shout.

854
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,430
I just want you to get this fucker,
that's all.

855
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,160
It wasn't going to be easy, Joe.

856
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,270
Everything had moved on
while I'd been on my travels.

857
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:48,790
I was wearing the right clothes,
of course, but inside...

858
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,800
I felt a stranger.

859
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,150
It really pays to be
in the vanguard of things, Joe,

860
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,160
to be one of the first.

861
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,430
You' re superseded very quickly.

862
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,470
But much more important than that,
I wasn't there in my own right.

863
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,945
I was just with my boyfriend.

864
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,190
I was thinking,
I used to be invited here

865
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,830
when I was a fashionable writer.

866
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,510
I just want to talk to somebody
over there. I' ll be back.

867
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,520
-Don't be long.
-Okay.

868
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:34,750
GREVILLE: People want
fantasy and stories,

869
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,070
beautiful worlds to escape to.

870
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:41,415
I mean, that's always been the case
and always will.

871
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:57,615
And very sad, because writers tell us
how to live our lives.

872
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,790
Can't go wrong with Turkish Delight,

873
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,950
and probably Turks
have never even heard of it.

874
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,085
Sorry, I'm just gabbling.

875
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,560
Excuse me.

876
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:46,080
Something happened at this party

877
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,980
that had a big effect on me.

878
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:52,310
I mean, a lot of what they say
is new about these movies

879
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,110
has, in fact, been done
loads of times before.

880
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,396
Greville likes to talk, doesn't he?

881
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,830
GREVILLE: Done by people
who were true artists,

882
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:04,190
and that is why their work hasn't dated.

883
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,410
Unlike this new breed now,

884
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,590
who are addicted to gimmicks
and the latest fad.

885
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,750
MARY: And this man suddenly piped up...

886
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,760
That's complete crap!

887
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:19,715
Everything you said
is just such utter bollocks!

888
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,070
MARY: He'd no respect for this older man
in a waistcoat.

889
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,800
He just gave it to him and went.

890
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,950
What a charming young man.

891
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,990
Fascinating that he wanted
to share his opinions with us.

892
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,485
MARY: I thought,
"I should have done that.

893
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,535
"Why don't I do that to Greville? "

894
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,073
And then, of course, I realised

895
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:52,475
I could never talk to Greville
like that.

896
01:06:52,485 --> 01:06:55,030
Brutal and rude, I don't know.

897
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:01,150
I just, maybe because
I belonged to another time, I...

898
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,833
I don't know why I couldn't.

899
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,350
Because I was afraid.

900
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,830
I couldn't even go up to him
at that party.

901
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,230
He's looking
for someone else to talk to,

902
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:13,470
to engage with, and I'm almost hiding!

903
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:16,600
And then,

904
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,234
he looks at me.

905
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,040
He looks across at me,

906
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,590
and though he didn't say anything,
I could hear him saying...

907
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,600
But you're still mine.

908
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:38,760
But you're still mine, aren't you, Mary?

909
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,070
I tried not to run,

910
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,735
not to look
like I was fleeing his presence.

911
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,150
I didn't want to creep out
of there either,

912
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:22,410
but I got away from this house
as quick as I could.

913
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:36,010
What, you left here
without saying anything to him?

914
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,605
That' s right. I left him looking for me.

915
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:46,050
But you did speak to him again,
didn't you?

916
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,520
Go on.

917
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
MARY: For a few months,

918
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
or maybe a year,

919
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,557
I sunk myself into my love affair

920
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:07,840
with the artist.

921
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,765
He was getting really successful,

922
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,440
almost famous.

923
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:21,395
But he was very careful with money,

924
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,560
extremely mean, in fact.

925
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:36,029
So for a time we lived in this bedsit,

926
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,950
and he disappeared for days on end
to his studio.

927
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:44,550
When he wasn't painting,
he was thinking deep thoughts.

928
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,630
He had an awful lot of deep thoughts,
it seems.

929
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,445
None of which I ever got to hear.

930
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,590
And the room was just crammed
with his things,

931
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,640
as well as his thoughts.

932
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:08,957
And I started having a little tipple
at various moments of the day.

933
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,870
I found it helped the creative flow.

934
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:13,880
Shit! Fuck!

935
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,590
Oh, I nearly cut myself!

936
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,590
Stepped on
one of your bloody wine glasses!

937
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:23,470
I told you so many times,
don't leave glasses on the floor, okay?

938
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,030
It's a real pigsty in here!

939
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,990
You have to clear it all up,
you understand?

940
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,514
Yeah, I understand.

941
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,510
I'll write it down a hundred times,
"It's a real pigsty in here."

942
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,750
And then
what are you going to do about it?

943
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,905
-What am I going to do about it?
-Yes.

944
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,830
Well, maybe I'll start by making a list

945
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:44,670
of all the things of yours
I'm not allowed to throw out.

946
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,390
"What are you doing, Mary?
You've moved the cornflake packet."

947
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,150
When have I ever said that?

948
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,550
You always say things like that!

949
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:53,710
I mean, just the other day
you accused me of throwing out

950
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,190
that stupid little green cloth

951
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,270
you're forever wiping
the gramophone with.

952
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,830
Just clean the place up, okay?

953
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,390
After all, you've got the time,
haven't you?

954
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,695
What, unlike you, you mean?

955
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:12,794
Yes.
I don't know what you do all day, Mary.

956
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:28,490
I was beginning to write again,
another attempt at a novel.

957
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,470
Outside all sorts of new things
were happening

958
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:36,495
and I thought I should be able
to catch them, describe them.

959
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,716
But the funny thing was

960
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:45,990
it didn't matter whether
I started the story on a train,

961
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,080
or in the desert,
or outside Buckingham Palace...

962
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,400
it always, always led back to the cellar

963
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,200

(CHURCH BELLS RINGING)

965
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:47,390
One day, I started to write
directly on a typewriter.

966
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:51,390
Up till then, I'd always done
the first draft in longhand.

967
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,110
It was a nice day.

968
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,230
There were church bells
outside the window,

969
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,980
somebody was getting married
down the street.

970
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,720
And I was flying,

971
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,200
absolutely flying with my story.

974
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,290
And then I wasn't flying any more.

975
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,710
Every time this happened,

976
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:56,205
my confidence
took a further little knock.

977
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,640
When you have success,

978
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,870
without really thinking about it,
when you're very young

979
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:08,790
and you're not quite sure
how you did all that,

980
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:15,145
your confidence can go amazingly quickly
when things go wrong.

981
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:21,440
Escape wasn't proving easy, Joe.

982
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:29,310
I knew a lot of people, you know,
friends, acquaintances,

983
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,910
who'd become successful round that time

984
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:36,170
and then destroyed themselves
with drink and drugs.

985
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:48,370
And I decided I was definitely
not going to be one of them.

01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,720
-Try my hard est.
-Good.

987
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,797
-I pulled myself together.
-Great!

988
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,310
Yeah, I started going out again,

989
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,990

with my boyfriend.

01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,830
Of course, I realised
that there was a slight chance

01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,840
I might see Greville,

but I was ready for it.

994
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,510
Well, yeah, because you ain't spoken
to him about him getting you fired.

995
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:34,990
-I hadn't, no.
-Oh, you gotta speak to him about that.

996
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
That's right.

So at one particular private view,
being held at a house in the country,

998
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,190
I was sitting there with my boyfriend.

999
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:53,470
We'd been breaking up for months,
only we'd been doing it in slow motion,

a little bit each week.

1001
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:59,430
On this particular night,
what we were saying to each other was...

1002
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,635
It was fairly terminal.

1003
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:07,477
Maybe it's because I need more space.

1004
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:11,599
I think I really do need
a lot more space.

1005
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:17,869
He was too mean to buy more space,
so he had to kick me out instead.

1006
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:20,950
Naturally, I wasn't slow
in pointing this out.

1007
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,870
You know what, Zach?

1008
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,550
The other day, I was trying to think
of the last thing you bought me,

1009
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,470
any, any kind of present.
You know what it was?

to celebrate my birthday.

01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,870
I don't believe in birthdays.
Never have.

1012
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:42,233
-Now, why doesn't that surprise me?
-But I know what you'd like.

1013
01:16:42,243 --> 01:16:44,708
What would I like?

1014
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,230
You'd like a crate of vodka delivered
at the beginning of every week.

1015
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:52,830
You'd wake up,
there it would be at the end of the bed.

1016
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:57,633
Once a week?
That certainly wouldn't be enough.

1017
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:02,190
So there we were, right in the middle
of our break-up,

1018
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,237
and there...

1019
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,390
there was Greville.

1020
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:11,070
Hello. I saw you at the Glyn-Parrys,
in August?

1021
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,430
You don't remember?

1022
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,710
I think we were sitting
quite near each other.

1023
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:16,670
MARY: He was dressed
in his usual old-fashioned way,

1024
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:20,590
almost defiantly
out of keeping with the times.

1025
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,270
He keeps avoiding catching my eye.

1026
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,550
I mean, he knows I'm there.
I know he's seen me, but he...

1027
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,994
He won't look at me.

1028
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,755
You know, he's smiling
and trying to gossip with people.

1029
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,990
Did you enjoy the exhibition?

1030
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,150
T ell me, were they meant to be
people or fruit?

1031
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,160
-What?
-The shapes.

1032
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,790
They looked like fruit to me.

1033
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,590
But somebody said
they were meant to be people.

1034
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,550
MARY: And Liza was there as well.
She was dressed very oddly, too.

1035
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,830
Almost like her mother might have been.

1036
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:57,350
I' m having a party in my little flat
in Kensington in a few weeks,

1037
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:58,790
I do hope you' ll come.

1038
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,190
MARY: She was still very young,
and yet she looked so out of place.

1039
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,670
Apparently, there are only
12 interesting people in London,

1040
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:09,150
and so it will have to be a very tiny
gathering, as you can imagine.

1041
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,200
But you are one of them.

1042
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,705
Hello. Did you get my letter?

1043
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,470
The post is terrible, isn't it?
Well, I've had an idea for a book.

1044
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,430
I was wondering
if we could talk about it?

1045
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,635
It's a memoir, really.

1046
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,710
I think it would make
quite a lively read.

1047
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,350
The time I spent
with Lloyd George and Churchill.

1048
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,830
Yes, I worked on Churchill's papers.

1049
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:34,790
I got to know him quite well.
I got drunk with him, actually.

1050
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,830
MARY: It was like their joke
on the world,

1051
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,310
you know, this strange couple
weaving some sort of spell.

1052
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,790
I must take you out for a meal.

1053
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,710
MARY: It wasn't really working any more.

1054
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:47,190
I think you' ll be surprised,
in more ways than one.

1055
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,200
Give me a ring.

1056
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,870
MARY: But it's like he knew
his power was on the wane.

1057
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,880
(SIGHS)

1058
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:03,230
The great newspaper proprietors
he was close to were now dead.

1059
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:07,405
He didn't have
nearly so many influential friends.

1060
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,873
He was standing very straight,

1061
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:18,229
you know, like he was determined
not to be engulfed by this new world.

1062
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:22,825
This world he had first sensed,
maybe, when he met me.

1063
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,230
I was almost relishing
watching him like that,

1064
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,993
and I was thinking about Liza.

1065
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,470
Yes, yes, he was rather interesting...

1066
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,630
MARY: Was that
what he'd wanted me to become?

1067
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,950
...an interesting person
to my interesting party.

1068
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,310
Was he one of the 12
most interesting men in London?

1069
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,230
Apparently, yes. Yes.

1070
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,430
What number does that make me, I wonder?

1071
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,910
Well, of course,
you're number one, Greville!

1072
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,070
MARY: And then their car draws up
and they both get in.

1073
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:56,039
I'm feeling almost relaxed now.
They're going,

1074
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,110
and nothing has happened.

1075
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,112
Nothing bad has occurred at all.

1076
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:07,350
And I remember so clearly watching
them together in the back of the car.

1077
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,360
The car draws off.

1078
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:20,150
And then, he stares straight at me.
He mouths...

1079
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,110
Help me!

1080
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,120
Help me!

1081
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,716
"Help me, Mary! "

1082
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,200
Help me, Mary!

1083
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,040
Help me!

1084
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:42,916
It wasn't a pathetic cry, Joe.
Quite the reverse.

1085
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,830
It was terrifying.

1086
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,920
Help me, Mary.

1087
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,520
Help me.

1088
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:30,070
And then I never saw him again, Joe.

1089
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,080
What?

1090
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,480
-You didn't?
-No.

1091
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,750
You never ever said anything
about what he'd done to you?

1092
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,190
No.

1093
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,150
You didn't ring him up or anything
and say,

1094
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:48,090
"Why should I help you?
You did this terrible thing to me."

1095
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,040
No.

1096
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,580
I didn't see him again, Joe.

1097
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,480
Until today.

1098
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:15,555
-Today?
-I saw him today.

1099
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:19,596
But, well, he must be old, mustn't he?

1100
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:24,430
I mean, it's a long time ago.
He must be an incredibly old man.

1101
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,750
You would have thought so,
wouldn't you, Joe?

1102
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,760
What do you mean?

1103
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,440
Where did you see him?

1104
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:42,710
MARY: I often go for a walk in the park
in the morning.

1105
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,950
And usually it's all right,
alone with one's thoughts,

1106
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,960
planning the next day.

1107
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,560
GREVILLE: Mary!

1108
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,320
Mary!

1109
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,730
I didn't hear my name again,
so I just got on with my walk.

1110
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:30,590
And I'm dimly aware of this figure
just a little further on,

1111
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,680
keeping pace with me,
walking along another path.

1112
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,750
He didn't seem to be looking at me.

1113
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:44,945
I realised, you know,
he must have been calling somebody else.

1114
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,365
You know, I get to my usual spot.

1115
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:53,100
I often sit there for a few minutes.

1116
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,360
GREVILLE: Mary.

1117
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,830
Mary.

1118
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,674
And I thought,
"Looks terribly like Greville.

1119
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,753
"No, that's impossible,
because he's not old."

1120
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:20,900
And Greville was much older than me.

1121
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:30,445
No. No, it must be somebody else.

1122
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:36,871
Now, I know what you' re thinking,
it was the drink.

1123
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:42,060
This drink, in fact.
And, of course, you could be right, Joe.

1124
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:47,350
Because this isn't a ghost story. No.

1125
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,185
No, this is worse than a ghost story.

1126
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:53,520
For me, anyway.

1127
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,630
Why?

1128
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:59,295
Well, what happened?
Did he come any closer?

1129
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,830
It's very important,

1130
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:04,750
because of what happens next,
for you to understand.

1131
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:08,910
I don't usually sit in the park in
the morning feeling sorry for myself.

1132
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:10,430
I hate the idea.

1133
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:14,399
I haven't spent
all these years in self-pity.

1134
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:18,314
-Do you follow that, Joe?
-Yeah.

1135
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:23,070
I mean, I had rebuilt, you know,
a sort of career for myself

1136
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,311
after the setbacks caused by Greville.

1137
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,910
You know, I've written for magazines

1138
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,490
about gardening and lifestyle
and antiques.

1139
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,030
I've been able to
earn a reasonable living.

1140
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:40,230
You know, many people would think
I'd been lucky to lead such a life.

1141
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:44,392
-Do you understand me, Joe?
-Yeah, I do.

1142
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,135
I thought it was you, Mary.

1143
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,790
What are you doing here?

1144
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,680
All on your own?

1145
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:04,070
I always thought if I saw you again,
it would be in this park,

1146
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,545
and you would be on your own.

1147
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,310
MARY: I couldn't speak,

1148
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:12,390
but he seemed to sense
what I was thinking.

1149
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,440
I am not alone, in fact.

1150
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,720
MARY: I peered at them.

1151
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,925
Could one of them have been Liza?

1152
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:24,875
GREVILLE: How' s it been, Mary?

1153
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:27,960
Everything you hoped?

1154
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,920
Silly girl.

1155
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:37,355
If it was an hallucination,
it was a very sustained one.

1156
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,080
Suddenly, he was close.

1157
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:45,495
I kept looking for your name.
I could never find it.

1158
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:50,190
I've had some painful things
happen to me, too.

1159
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,840
We could have helped each other.

1160
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:55,960
Like I said.

1161
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:00,710
All you could think
was that I wanted to catch you,

1162
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:02,720
control you.

1163
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:07,000
Where have you been all this time, Mary?

1164
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:10,675
Where is the bright young girl?

1165
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,470
I can see no sign of her.

1166
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,840
No sign at all.

1167
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:43,310
MARY: The very first thing I thought
about after he'd gone, it was funny,

1168
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,550
it was I suddenly understood

1169
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,350
why he was always there
at Mr Graham 's parties.

1170
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,150
I realised right then

1171
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:55,030
it must have been because he knew
something about Mr Graham 's past.

1172
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:59,885
For a moment, I was quite excited to
have worked that out.

1173
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,720
But then,

1174
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:14,550
I started thinking
the worst possible thoughts.

1175
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:23,680
What might have been.

1176
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,839
How stupid I was

1177
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:50,020
to think I could take on that world
when I was so very young.

1178
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,795
If only I'd been 10 years older,
or been born

1179
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,480
a few years later,

1180
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:05,455
when things were different.

1181
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,319
A young woman in that house.

1182
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,320
It shouldn't ever have happened.

1183
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:28,915
And I've never been able to
shake it off, all this time.

1184
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
How idiotic is that?

1185
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,553
And I was thinking, too,

1186
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:48,509
have I used what happened with Greville
as an excuse, my whole life,

1187
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,810
for the loss of my talent?

1188
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:04,245
I remembered his party trick
of seeing yourself as others see you.

1189
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:18,800
And all the time,

1190
01:30:19,720 --> 01:30:21,760
there was this sensation

1191
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,730
like the lights being turned down.

1192
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:35,519
Things closing in, shutting down.

1193
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:43,359
Suddenly, I found it
difficult to breathe.

1194
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,440
It was an utterly horrible feeling, Joe.

1195
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:17,276
(SOBBING)

1196
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:17,431
Anyway, it was disgraceful, Joe,
my exhibition.

1197
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,400
You know,

1198
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,200
crying for one' s youth.

1199
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,215
What a useless thing to do.

1200
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,640
I ran away.

1201
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:43,645
I ran away from the park.

1202
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,880
But at least

1203
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:57,920
that feeling

1204
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,400
of things shutting down,

1205
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,600
of it all ending,

1206
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:10,400
I fought that.

1207
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:15,036
He didn't manage that.

1208
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:23,237
And somehow, I managed to come here.

1209
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:30,113
Something I've been thinking about
for years,

1210
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,320
to come back here,

1211
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,200
confront the place.

1212
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,600
Today,

1213
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:42,040
after the park,

1214
01:33:45,080 --> 01:33:47,460
I just walked straight here.

1215
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,850
It seemed the obvious thing to do.

1216
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:58,790
And you were kind enough to let me in.

1217
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:04,950
-You came to see if he was here?
-To see if I could get rid of a ghost.

1218
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,795
Which isn't a ghost, of course.

1219
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:16,360
Not a proper ghost.

1220
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,720
And have you?

1221
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:27,240
Have you?

1222
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:32,710
-I'm sorry, Joe, I have to go now.
-Well, you have, haven't you?

1223
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,720
Got rid of him?

1224
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,510
Yes.

1225
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,520
Promise me?

1226
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:45,430
Yes. Uh, don't bother to show me out,
Joe, I know the way.

1227
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,710
I've just got to get out of this house!

1228
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:51,150
-Are you going to the park tomorrow?
-Yeah, I might do.

1229
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:53,160
Can I come, too?

1230
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:57,750
-See where it happened?
-See if he's still there, you mean?

1231
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:01,719
-11:00, hope I turn up.
-Which park?

1232
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,205
But you ain't told me which park!

1233
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:09,230
Kensington Gardens.

1234
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,240
(DOOR SLAMMING)

1235
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:20,565
JOE: She'd given me the time
and the park,

1236
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,316
but not where she'd be.

1237
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:28,860
I looked and looked for her.

1238
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,960
I didn't find her.

1239
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:40,470
And then, at last,
just when I was going,

1240
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,560
there she was.

1241
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,600
Hello, Joe.

1242
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:57,477
Here I am. You didn't think I'd come.

1243
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:03,890
JOE: We walked in silence.

1244
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,760
She didn't seem to want to talk.

1245
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:12,135
I don't know what she was thinking.

1246
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:25,960
Oh, is this the spot?

1247
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:28,640
Yeah, this is the spot.

1248
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,185
JOE: I still didn't know what to say.

1249
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:40,885
So I didn't say anything.

1250
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:56,440
You can go now, Joe.

1251
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:00,440
Thank you for staying.

1252
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,035
It's okay.

1253
01:37:03,045 --> 01:37:05,040
It'll be fine.

1254
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,080
I'll be fine.

1255
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,473
-You helped me.
-Right.

1256
01:37:12,520 --> 01:37:15,580
But I just need to be on my own now.

1257
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:21,440
You can leave, Joe. It's okay.

1258
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,520
I promise.

1259
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:34,770
JOE: So, I left her there.

1260
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:37,880
And she did seem better,

1261
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:40,760
I think.

1262
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,190
She was sitting there
looking quite elegant,

1263
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:45,920
reading a book, when I left her.

1264
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,250
I keep thinking about her.

1265
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:00,455
Things I still want to ask.

1266
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:05,490
I'll go back tomorrow to the park,

1267
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:09,120
but I expect she won't be there.

1268
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:14,710
There was something about her.

1269
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:28,680
I like that lady.

1270
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,720
I hope she never sees him again.

1271
01:38:36,721 --> 01:38:39,221
