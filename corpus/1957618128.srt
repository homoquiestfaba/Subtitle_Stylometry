1
00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:03,866
(gentle music)

2
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:14,333
(birds cawing)

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,733
- Hey.

4
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:30,933
Race you to the monkey bars.

5
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:47,666
You look like a Klingon that landed

6
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,166
on your head on the Venice boardwalk.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,433
- Stop showing off and come down from there.

8
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,333
(Vicki laughs)

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,100
(phone ringing)

10
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,633
- You okay? - Yeah.

11
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,300
(phone ringing)

12
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,666
(dial tone ringing) - Hello.

13
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:18,633
- [Dispatcher] Parker Center to four-king-10,

14
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,333
patching through to four-king-20.

15
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:23,300
- Four-king-10, over.

16
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,966
- Lieutenant, this is Harry McBride.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,800
Sir, I'm sorry, I tried to reach you at home,

18
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,033
but no go there.

19
00:01:29,066 --> 00:01:30,433
I'm actually in your neighborhood now,

20
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,766
across the street in the parking lot,

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,066
the Surf Side Fitness Center.

22
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,733
We have a stabbing victim, Caucasian woman, late 20s.

23
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,833
Sir, I think you might want to come take a look at this one.

24
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:43,000
- I'll be there in 10 minutes, Harry.

25
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:44,100
Four-king-10 out.

26
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:48,566
(dispatcher chattering on radio)

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,133
(solemn music)

28
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:12,566
Harry.

29
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,700
- Lieutenant.

30
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,700
- I gotta tell ya, I don't miss this.

31
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:25,666
- [Harry] No sir.

32
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,233
- Stan, what's up?

33
00:02:27,266 --> 00:02:29,766
- The victim's name is Rachel Kincaid, age 29.

34
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,200
She lives in Marina Del Rey, approximate time of death

35
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:34,833
six hours ago, she was leaving the gym.

36
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:35,966
ME says it looks right-handed.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,500
She was cut from the lower right,

38
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:38,933
straight across the upper left.

39
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:40,200
- We talk to family members yet?

40
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:42,000
- We had her boyfriend here till about a half hour ago.

41
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:43,433
We let him go.

42
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:44,833
The rest of the family's back east.

43
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,233
- Could he be a suspect?

44
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,266
- No sir.

45
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,566
- He took one look and coughed up his breakfast.

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,733
We do have a witness.

47
00:02:49,766 --> 00:02:51,033
(siren trills)

48
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:52,233
Blonde lady there, aerobics suit on,

49
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:54,033
saw a white male, late 30s, leaving the lot in a hurry.

50
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,633
- Okay, get her to a sketch artist,

51
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,900
have the full report on my desk by five o'clock.

52
00:02:57,933 --> 00:02:59,533
5:05 I'm outta there.

53
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:01,133
- Sir, that's some rough life up there

54
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,866
on the high command, eh?

55
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,066
- It's one of the many perks of being a lieutenant.

56
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:06,833
Carry on, Harry.

57
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,933
- Oh man.

58
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:18,233
- Whoa, whoa, don't sit down, this is the gift

59
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,566
you had me pick up for Vicki, you have to do

60
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,566
the card yourself, that's where I draw the line.

61
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
- Great.

62
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:24,533
What'd you think of it?

63
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:25,966
- I'm impressed.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,900
- Thanks, Lucille.

65
00:03:28,766 --> 00:03:30,233
- What did it cost?

66
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,866
- Less than she would spend, more than you can afford.

67
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,233
- Ah.

68
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:35,600
- Okay, you have a 9:15 robbery homicide meeting,

69
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,433
you have a briefing with the deputy chief,

70
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,900
and mid-quarter reviews are due at the middle of this month,

71
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,000
which is tomorrow.

72
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:44,166
- You're a regular calendar girl, Lucille Banks.

73
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,433
- I'll assume that's not a sexist remark

74
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:49,033
for which I'll have to file harassment charges.

75
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:51,500
Oh, oh, oh oh!

76
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:54,800
Your insurance check came in for the earthquake damage!

77
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,666
- Ah, great.

78
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,100
Been waiting months for this thing.

79
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:00,466
I'm so tired of living out of a box, oh yeah.

80
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,900
- Well, if you need anything.

81
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:04,533
- Lucille.

82
00:04:04,566 --> 00:04:05,400
Thank you.

83
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,666
- Hi Captain. - Hey, Lucille.

84
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:10,933
So, what you got there?

85
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,700
- Insurance check, Charlie.

86
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:14,633
- Hmm, about time. - Yeah.

87
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,133
- So how you doing?

88
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,800
- Not bad for a Thursday.

89
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,300
What's on your mind?

90
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,266
- Oh, can't a guy come in and say "hello, how are ya?"

91
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,033
- Yeah, how are ya?

92
00:04:23,066 --> 00:04:24,200
- Great, how about you?

93
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,666
- Well, it's Valentine's Day, Charlie,

94
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,633
and there was a murder this morning.

95
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,466
- Yeah.

96
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,600
Hell of a city, huh?

97
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:31,200
- McBride is on it.

98
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:32,733
- I want you to go easy on me.

99
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:35,933
- You lost me.

100
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:38,000
- Tomorrow night at my retirement roast.

101
00:04:38,033 --> 00:04:39,133
Everybody's gonna be getting up

102
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:39,900
telling their favorite little anecdote--

103
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,100
- Just a second.

104
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:42,466
You think that I would stand up there

105
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,766
and tell some embarrassing story about you?

106
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,133
- That's exactly what I'm talking about,

107
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,500
and if the Haskill incident is even metioned--

108
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:48,466
- Yeah, Lucille.

109
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,100
- [Lucille] Vicki's on the line.

110
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,833
- Well, hold that thought, Johnny.

111
00:04:53,166 --> 00:04:53,966
Hi.

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,166
- Hi, honey.

113
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,933
I made great time, I just hope I can get back

114
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:59,000
on the 405 before it becomes a parking lot.

115
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,700
- I want you to know that I made reservations for two

116
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:04,233
tonight at eight o'clock at Picaccio's.

117
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:05,266
- Picaccio's?

118
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,766
I'm impressed.

119
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,600
Dating habits have come a long way, Lieutenant Hunter.

120
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:11,233
- Well, we could go to Denny's,

121
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:12,700
but after all, it is Valentine's Day.

122
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:16,533
- No, no, no, Picaccio's is just fine, hey Dad.

123
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,733
- Hi dollface.

124
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,200
- Let me talk to Rick.

125
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,700
- Tommy wants to say hello.

126
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,433
- Did you buy Mom a present?

127
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:25,966
It's Valentine's Day.

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,266
- Yup, sure did.

129
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,100
- What is it?

130
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:29,333
Tell me what it is.

131
00:05:29,366 --> 00:05:30,566
- Oh, I can't tell you what it is.

132
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,666
Your mom will show you when she gets home.

133
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,066
- That's enough, Tommy.

134
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,700
Go on upstairs and get changed.

135
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:35,633
- [Tommy] Okay.

136
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,833
- Yeah, we saddle up right now,

137
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:37,500
we can go riding before lunch, okay?

138
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:38,633
- All right!

139
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,900
- All right!

140
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,533
- Listen, I have to swing by the office

141
00:05:41,566 --> 00:05:43,733
and then I need to referee the installation

142
00:05:43,766 --> 00:05:45,500
at the Brewstein house, he'll love the couches,

143
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:48,066
he'll hate them when he finds out how much they cost.

144
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,666
Why don't I just meet you at the restaurant?

145
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,300
- That's a good idea.

146
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:54,900
- I love you, Lieutenant Hunter.

147
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:56,233
- I love you.

148
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:57,400
- Bye.

149
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:58,266
- Bye.

150
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,000
- Real good to see you, baby.

151
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,700
- I can't stay all day.

152
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:05,600
- Well, you're gonna stay for lunch,

153
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,366
and then I'm gonna take Tommy fishing

154
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,000
and your sister's coming by with the baby,

155
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,633
and then you better right Avatar,

156
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,466
she's gonna die of neglect.

157
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,600
- I love it when you tell me what to do, Dad.

158
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:17,866
I do.

159
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,100
- Lucille, where's that store again?

160
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,066
- Beverly Drive, south of Wilshire.

161
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,266
- I'll be in briefings and then

162
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,866
you can clock me out for lunch.

163
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:27,766
- So.

164
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,600
- So what?

165
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:29,833
- So tomorrow night.

166
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:31,866
- Oh look, Charlie, tomorrow is your night,

167
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,766
your special night, there's no way I'd stand up there

168
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,633
and tell an embarrassing story about you.

169
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,833
No, no.

170
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,700
Your friendship means way, way too much.

171
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:41,733
- Now, I know that's bull, I know what you're up to, Hunter!

172
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,633
(birds chirping)

173
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
- [Clerk] Thank you.

174
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,533
- [Frank] A little far west to see you, Lieutenant.

175
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:55,233
- Well, believe it or not, Frank,

176
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:56,900
I know how to find Beverly Hills.

177
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,133
How long you been married?

178
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:02,400
- 23 glorious years.

179
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,733
- What do you think of that?

180
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,900
- Well, I think the size of a ring isn't important,

181
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:15,366
it's the weight of the thought behind it that counts.

182
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,100
- You're a true politician, Frank.

183
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:18,833
- I'll take that as a compliment.

184
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:20,100
- It was meant to be one.

185
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:24,133
Oh, and by the way, Frank, listen, I wanna say

186
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,633
thank you very much for the help on the Rodriguez case.

187
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,833
I never thought you'd push for murder one.

188
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:30,500
- Neither did the Times.

189
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,000
That's why I did it.

190
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:34,466
- Law and order look good on the campaign trail, Frank?

191
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,700
Especially now.

192
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:38,333
- Oh no no, I'm only the district attorney.

193
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:39,900
I am not officially a candidate

194
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,800
for any other office in this state.

195
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,433
- How many times a day do you say that?

196
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:46,966
- Oh, as many times as I can, Hunter. (chuckles)

197
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,933
Buh-bye, thank you.

198
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,200
- Yes. (chuckles)

199
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:58,400
(gentle music)

200
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:00,300
Happy Valentine's Day.

201
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,633
- Neiman Marcus?

202
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:03,900
Rick. - Open it.

203
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,766
- Oh, Rick.

204
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,433
It's gorgeous.

205
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:12,066
- You remember we looked at that the other day?

206
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,533
- [Vicki] Yeah.

207
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:15,166
- It's got a cute little place there for your (mumbles).

208
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,433
- Yeah, I know.

209
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,233
- Oh, your turn.

210
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,366
- For me?

211
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,366
- Happy Valentine's Day.

212
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,233
- Thanks.

213
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,533
Uh-oh.

214
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:27,100
This looks like a serious gift.

215
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,800
"My Love Forever, Vicki."

216
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,333
I must be the luckiest guy in the LAPD.

217
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:49,533
- Oh, yeah.

218
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:51,000
This coming from a man who owned a house

219
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,366
on the Northridge fault line.

220
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
- Oh, listen.

221
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,933
I finally got my insurance check.

222
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:57,233
- Oh, great.

223
00:08:57,266 --> 00:08:58,533
You know, prices are still low,

224
00:08:58,566 --> 00:09:00,766
you should really think about buying something.

225
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
- Mm-hmm, I was thinking maybe the Hollywood Hills.

226
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,700
- Too many mud slides.

227
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:04,600
- Topanga Canyon.

228
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,766
- Charlie lost his place there in the fire.

229
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,000
- You're right about that.

230
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:15,033
- You should move into my place in Malibu, bank the money.

231
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:19,600
- No, I don't think I could take advantage

232
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:24,633
of a successful professional woman such as yourself.

233
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:26,300
But we could fix that.

234
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,000
You could marry me.

235
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:39,433
- Oh, Rick.

236
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,733
- What do you say, Vicki?

237
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:45,566
- I say yes.

238
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,433
(sinister music)

239
00:10:39,466 --> 00:10:40,266
Rick.

240
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,066
(car engine starting)

241
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,100
(suspenseful music)

242
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,333
- Black Mercedes.

243
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,333
(Vicki sighs)

244
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:29,866
- Why won't he leave me alone?

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,333
It's been two years, for god's sake.

246
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,366
- I'll take care of this in the morning.

247
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:50,600
(elevator bell dings) (people chattering)

248
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:53,933
- Elizabeth, that looks terrific.

249
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:55,500
- [Elizabeth] Thank you, Harry.

250
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:57,200
- Sam, hi. - Harry.

251
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:58,733
- Hey Lar.

252
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:00,466
- [Man] If you can get a handle on that,

253
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,233
I'd really appreciate it, because I've

254
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,500
got a meeting with--

255
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:03,600
- Lieutenant.

256
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:05,100
Sir.

257
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:06,800
I'm afraid we're out of luck on the Kincaid case.

258
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,466
The line at the coroner's office was around the block.

259
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,133
I did, however, manage to dip into the favor bank

260
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,733
and procure this.

261
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:16,466
- Oh, Harry, you are a sweetheart.

262
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:26,600
I knew they had their problems.

263
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,400
I didn't think it went this far.

264
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:30,500
- I'm afraid so, sir.

265
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:34,300
Evidently two NBA championships will buy you a sealed file

266
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,766
plus a couple hundred hours of community service.

267
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:42,600
- Putting the ball through the hoop is a good thing.

268
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:45,566
Putting yourself through school is even better.

269
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,633
Now, if you think this is gonna help you through life

270
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:50,633
better than this, you're gonna be in more foul trouble

271
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,700
than you can imagine.

272
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,766
Stay in school.

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,966
There's no better way to get ahead in life.

274
00:12:57,866 --> 00:12:59,333
- And cut.

275
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:00,500
Russ, how was that for you?

276
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:01,800
- [Russ] Very nice.

277
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,233
- Okay, great, we should move on.

278
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:04,600
Matt, that was terrific.

279
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:06,533
I wanna go one more time with a closer shot,

280
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:08,133
I need about 10 minutes to set it up.

281
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,466
- Whatever you need, Steve, I'm all yours.

282
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,633
- Thank you, thank you.

283
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,533
Russ, let's talk about this next shot.

284
00:13:12,566 --> 00:13:13,566
(people chattering)

285
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,466
- Hey, Rick.

286
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,733
- It's a good message, Matt.

287
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:19,233
- What can I do for you?

288
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,166
- Well, you can start off by telling

289
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,333
what you were doing prowling around

290
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:24,633
Vicki's house last night.

291
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,800
You're lucky I didn't shoot you in your ass.

292
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,866
- Look, I still love Vicki, and nothing personal,

293
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,866
but it kills me to see you with my family.

294
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,400
- And?

295
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:39,200
- And I went by her house on the way home last night

296
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:41,633
and I saw your car in the driveway.

297
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:43,500
- She's afraid of you, Matt.

298
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,800
- That is ridiculous, I'd never hurt Vicki.

299
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,633
- Your record for domestic violence is well established.

300
00:13:50,266 --> 00:13:52,533
- Those records were sealed by the court.

301
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:53,400
- Yes they were.

302
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,666
- Anyway, that's all in the past, and actually,

303
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,733
it's none of your damn business, is it?

304
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,433
- It is now.

305
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,666
I've asked Vicki to marry me, Matt.

306
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:14,700
- That so.

307
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:18,900
Has she told Tommy yet?

308
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,066
- No, not yet.

309
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,866
Look, I understand your feelings,

310
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,233
you should understand mine.

311
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,800
You can't go to the house anymore.

312
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:29,966
You can't harass her.

313
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,733
And you can never, ever lay your hands on her again,

314
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:35,366
you understand me?

315
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Those days are over.

316
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:41,366
Nothing personal.

317
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:50,433
(water splashing)

318
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:53,133
(phone ringing)

319
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,300
- Hello?

320
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,133
- [Rick] Hey, how you doing?

321
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,633
- [Vicki] Exhausted.

322
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,500
Will you still love me when I'm pregnant and out of shape?

323
00:14:58,533 --> 00:14:59,966
- Better believe it.

324
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,800
- Good, I can stop peddling.

325
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,033
- Listen, I completely forgot about

326
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:07,566
Charlie's retirement party tonight.

327
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,566
- How late you think you're gonna be?

328
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,833
- Late, this thing isn't even gonna get off the ground

329
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:13,066
till nine or 10 o'clock.

330
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:16,833
- Oh, by the way, did you have a chance to talk to Matt?

331
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:17,700
- Yes.

332
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,000
- What'd you say?

333
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:24,466
- Well, I told him to lay off, and I think he got that.

334
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,133
I also told him we're getting married.

335
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:31,500
- Oh, Rick.

336
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,466
I wish you hadn't have done that,

337
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,000
I shoulda been the one to tell him.

338
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:38,200
- I know it, Vicki, you should've,

339
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,100
but it just came out, I'm sorry.

340
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:43,033
- It'll be okay, I'll just, I'll call him tomorrow.

341
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:44,700
- I love you.

342
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,000
- Yeah.

343
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:47,866
Have fun.

344
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:51,733
(phone beeps)

345
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:54,266
(Vicki sighs)

346
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:57,000
(phone clicks)

347
00:15:57,033 --> 00:15:59,766
- And now, from robbery homicide, your

348
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,133
favorite funny man,

349
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:05,000
earthquake victim, and a close, close personal friend

350
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:08,233
of Charlie Devane, Lieutenant Rick Hunter.

351
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:12,266
(crowd applauding and cheering)

352
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,166
- It's a pleasure for me to be here

353
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,433
with Charlie on his night, congratulations Charlie.

354
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:22,000
This evening's dinner would not be complete

355
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:24,333
without the story to end all stories,

356
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:27,300
I think we all know what that is, at least some of us do,

357
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,500
and that is the story of Thomas P. Haskill.

358
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:30,433
- Wait a minute now.

359
00:16:30,466 --> 00:16:31,966
Come on, you promised me.

360
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,966
- Well I know I promised, but it is your night,

361
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,266
I'm stuck for a story, besides,

362
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,866
we'd all like to hear it, wouldn't we?

363
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,900
(crowd applauding and cheering)

364
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,866
(sinister music)

365
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,800
(intercom buzzing)

366
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,066
- Who is it?

367
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,733
- Vicki, honey, it's me, I wanna talk to you.

368
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:35,633
- It's late, Matt.

369
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,633
- So, are you going to marry Hunter?

370
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:47,600
- Can we please talk about this tomorrow?

371
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,600
- No, I wanna talk now.

372
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,833
- Matt, forget it, you've been drinking.

373
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:52,700
- Sweetheart.

374
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,466
I drove all the way out here.

375
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,466
- Please go home.

376
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,433
I do need to talk to you, but not right now.

377
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,300
Matt?

378
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:10,700
(glass shattering) (Vicki screams)

379
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,800
(sinister music)

380
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,266
- I'm home, dear.

381
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,000
- Get the hell outta here, Matt, before I call the police.

382
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:17,933
- Call the police?

383
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:19,233
I thought they were here.

384
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,466
Yo, Mr. Police Officer!

385
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,933
- Matt, you're drunk!

386
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:27,100
- Oh, not the detective, must run in the family, huh?

387
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,633
Where's Tommy?

388
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:33,400
- He's at my father's for the weekend.

389
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,033
I want you to leave.

390
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,266
- I don't want you to marry Hunter.

391
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:40,366
I want us to be a family again.

392
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,100
I never meant to hurt you and Tommy, you know that.

393
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,733
I love you so much.

394
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,000
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?

395
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:51,866
- You're sorry?

396
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:56,033
You break into my house like this?

397
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:58,400
I don't appreciate this, Matt.

398
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:00,500
- Yeah, well I don't appreciate the visit

399
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:03,766
from your little friend, lover boy super cop.

400
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,366
Is he really super, huh?

401
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,466
Does he wear that gun in bed?

402
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,733
Does he pull out those cuffs and does he

403
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:13,033
place you under arrest?!

404
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:15,066
(glass shatters)

405
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,766
(Matt grunts)

406
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,900
- Get out!

407
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:19,800
- That's more like it.

408
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,333
That's my girl.

409
00:19:21,366 --> 00:19:22,800
- I'm warning you, Matt, you get the hell

410
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,966
out of my house now!

411
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,933
- No, I'm warning you!

412
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:28,733
(Vicki grunts)

413
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:31,766
You play on my team or you don't play at all.

414
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:41,100
- Anyway, Thomas P. Haskilll looks right at Charlie,

415
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:44,600
right straight in the face, and says,

416
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,266
"listen, you wanted me in the black skirt

417
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,566
"and pumps before, why not now, buster?"

418
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,033
(audience laughing)

419
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:55,233
(audience applauding)

420
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:02,166
(audience cheering)

421
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,366
- [Emcee] Well, that sort of wraps things up,

422
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,600
I wanna thank you all for coming tonight.

423
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:10,200
- Let me have a club soda with sherry.

424
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:11,666
- [Emcee] You're welcome to stay around,

425
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,333
we've got another, oh, an hour, an hour and a half here.

426
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:17,600
(phone ringing)

427
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,766
- Hello?

428
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,833
- Hey, Vicki.

429
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:20,700
You all right?

430
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:24,333
- Matt was here.

431
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:26,200
He was drunk.

432
00:20:26,233 --> 00:20:27,433
- I'm coming over there.

433
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:30,866
- No, no, no, it's okay, he's gone.

434
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,700
It's okay.

435
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,300
- I'll be right there.

436
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,600
(phone beeps)

437
00:20:36,633 --> 00:20:37,700
(phone clicks)

438
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,566
(intercom buzzing)

439
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,433
- [Vicki] Go away, Matt!

440
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:43,666
(suspenseful music)

441
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,500
(banging on door)

442
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:53,600
(line ringing)

443
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:55,066
- [Operator] 911 emergency.

444
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,566
- My ex-husband's at my door, he's gonna hit me again.

445
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,833
Please.

446
00:20:58,866 --> 00:20:59,566
- [Operator] And his name, please?

447
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,566
- Matt Sherry.

448
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,200
- [Operator] And your address.

449
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:05,766
- It's 7033 Old Malibu Road.

450
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,966
(engine roaring)

451
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
(suspenseful music)

452
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,400
(doorknob rattling)

453
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,933
(dispatcher chattering on radio)

454
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:35,833
(Vicki shouts)

455
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:38,100
(Vicki screaming)

456
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:40,966
(tires squealing)

457
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:48,200
- Wait a second, Hunter.

458
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:50,333
- Female, white.

459
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,900
(sinister music)

460
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,766
(solemn music)

461
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,333
- I sent McBride and Lewis to pick up Matt Sherry.

462
00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:41,233
I just don't know how to tell you how sorry I am, Rick.

463
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:47,900
- Bastard killed her, Charlie.

464
00:22:51,033 --> 00:22:53,466
(banging knocker)

465
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,000
(dog barking)

466
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,733
- [Harry] Matt Sherry?

467
00:22:57,766 --> 00:22:58,600
- Yeah?

468
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:00,700
- LAPD.

469
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,833
I'm Sergeant Detective Harry McBride, homicide.

470
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,566
This is my partner, Detective Stan Lewis.

471
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,433
- Evening, Coach.

472
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,300
- I'm sorry to have to be the one to inform you

473
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:17,033
that your ex-wife, Vicki Sherry, has been murdered, sir.

474
00:23:18,166 --> 00:23:19,766
(solemn music)

475
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,633
- What?

476
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,800
What the hell are you talking about?

477
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,233
- Actually, we're gonna need you to come downtown,

478
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:27,033
we need to ask you a few questions.

479
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:29,466
- Am I under arrest?

480
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,733
- Not at this time.

481
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:33,566
- Maybe I should call my attorney.

482
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:36,833
- Maybe you should, sir.

483
00:23:36,866 --> 00:23:38,666
- I know, but we're gonna wrap this up

484
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,866
just as soon as possible.

485
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,166
What time did you say you left the bar again?

486
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,333
- Around 11:15.

487
00:23:47,366 --> 00:23:50,466
- 11:15 plus 45, so that puts you at the house

488
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,200
on Old Malibu Road around midnight.

489
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:55,166
Now you were all angry, and that's when

490
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,333
you got in an argument?

491
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,166
- I wanted to see my son.

492
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,533
- Right, but unfortunately he wasn't there.

493
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,966
How long would you say the argument went on for?

494
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,933
- 10 minutes.

495
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,700
- And that's when you hit her.

496
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:10,566
- Yes.

497
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:12,433
- More than once?

498
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,333
- No.

499
00:24:16,366 --> 00:24:17,733
- [Michael] My client will seek counseling

500
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:19,400
for his aggressive behavior.

501
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:21,233
- What time did you get to the house the night before,

502
00:24:21,266 --> 00:24:23,066
when Lieutenant Hunter saw your car?

503
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:26,533
(Matt sighs)

504
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,366
- A little after two in the morning.

505
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,133
- Now, how many drinks did you have that night, Coach?

506
00:24:33,566 --> 00:24:36,366
- The same number I told you about an hour ago.

507
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,233
- And then the following day is when you got

508
00:24:38,266 --> 00:24:40,233
in the argument with Lieutenant Hunter?

509
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:44,000
- Argument, no, I think if you'll check your notes,

510
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:47,100
you'll see that we discussed his recent engagement.

511
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:48,633
- And how'd that make you feel?

512
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,366
His being engaged to your ex-wife.

513
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,700
- How many times do I have to answer

514
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:55,766
the same questions, Michael?

515
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,000
- All right, let's review, shall we?

516
00:24:58,033 --> 00:25:00,166
Yes he had too much to drink, yes he stopped by

517
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,233
to see his ex-wife, yes they had an argument,

518
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:03,900
no he did not kill her.

519
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:07,233
Captain, either charge my client right now

520
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,833
or I want him released on his own recognizance.

521
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:11,366
If you're not prepared to make that decision,

522
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,066
I suggest you speak with (mumbling).

523
00:25:30,966 --> 00:25:33,966
(people chattering)

524
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:39,700
- [Rick] Charlie, I want this case.

525
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:41,300
- That's not gonna happen, department regulations,

526
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,500
and besides, we're gonna have to let him go.

527
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:44,666
- No!

528
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,833
He's a 187 suspect, you know this!

529
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:48,300
We've got 72 hours to hold this guy,

530
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,100
now come on, Charlie, it's been less than 10.

531
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,833
- Look, it came from up top and that's all I can say.

532
00:25:52,866 --> 00:25:54,900
- Is that the way it's gonna be around here, huh?

533
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:56,866
The mayor calls the DA, the DA calls the chief,

534
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,633
the chief calls you and you kick the dog?

535
00:25:58,666 --> 00:25:59,966
Is that the way it's gonna be?

536
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,666
- If we arrest him and we were wrong,

537
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,333
we're gonna get screwed, you know that.

538
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:04,866
- Wrong?

539
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,266
Come on, Charlie, you know what time he left the bar,

540
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,466
we have the 911 call, there's fingerprints

541
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,100
all over the house, for crying out loud, what do you want?

542
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:12,900
- When the DA figures we got enough to charge him,

543
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:14,400
we'll pick him up again, all right?

544
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:16,533
He's not going anywhere, come on, wake up.

545
00:26:18,866 --> 00:26:22,600
(people chattering)

546
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:24,000
- Hey.

547
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:26,600
(men shouting)

548
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,433
- And I'm gonna prove it!

549
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:33,833
(men shouting)

550
00:26:33,866 --> 00:26:35,200
- Rick, come on.

551
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:39,000
Let's go.

552
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:41,133
Come on now, break it up.

553
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,000
Come on, that's okay.

554
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:44,466
- [Man] Let's go, come on.

555
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,400
- [Man] Come on now, come on.

556
00:26:46,433 --> 00:26:49,100
(phone ringing)

557
00:26:55,266 --> 00:27:00,266
(horn honking) (people shouting)

558
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,600
- Did you kill your ex-wife?

559
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:05,000
- No, I didn't. - Shut up, Matt.

560
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:06,266
- Have you been charged with anything?

561
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,000
- My client has not been charged with any crime.

562
00:27:08,033 --> 00:27:10,500
He's cooperating completely with the LAPD.

563
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:11,833
(people chattering)

564
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:13,233
- How long were you questioned?

565
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:14,700
- He was detained for four or five hours,

566
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,266
he's free to go on his own way now, if you'll excuse us,

567
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,866
it's been a long night for all of us.

568
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,733
(people shouting)

569
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,666
- Are you a suspect at this point, Coach?

570
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,933
- [Man] Excuse me please.

571
00:27:25,966 --> 00:27:27,400
- I wanna see my son right now.

572
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,266
(solemn music)

573
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:49,766
(siren trilling)

574
00:27:55,066 --> 00:27:57,433
- This quiet, upscale neighborhood in Bel-Air

575
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,000
has been turned upside-down with the events

576
00:28:00,033 --> 00:28:01,800
of the last 24 hours.

577
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,633
Coach Matt Sherry returned here several hours ago,

578
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:08,100
accompanied by his high-powered attorney Michael Katz.

579
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:10,866
Channel three has learned that the championship coach

580
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,566
had previously been arrested for spousal abuse

581
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,300
two years ago.

582
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:17,600
Those records reportedly remain sealed

583
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:20,133
in a deal struck with the DA's office.

584
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:22,866
Police sources also confirm that Coach Sherry

585
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,633
is the only suspect in the brutal killing

586
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,966
of Vicki Sherry at this time.

587
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,500
From the hills of Bel-Air, I'm Sally Vogel, Action News 3.

588
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:32,333
- Perfect.

589
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,933
They want us over in Malibu in 20 minutes.

590
00:28:34,966 --> 00:28:37,766
- Oh god, it's gonna look like I'm at two places at once.

591
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,866
All right, come on, we'll take Sunset to PCH.

592
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,066
- Let's do it.

593
00:28:43,466 --> 00:28:46,000
- I canceled your afternoon meetings.

594
00:28:47,466 --> 00:28:51,566
If there's anything you want me to do, Hunter, just ask.

595
00:28:57,266 --> 00:29:00,033
(sinister music)

596
00:29:05,366 --> 00:29:06,666
- I'd like to go upstairs.

597
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,466
(solemn music)

598
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:28,700
- Lieutenant, you really shouldn't be here.

599
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:29,566
- I know, Harry.

600
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:32,066
But I am here.

601
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:39,400
This been printed, Harry?

602
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:40,466
- Yes sir, it has.

603
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:54,033
(gentle music)

604
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:11,466
Lieutenant?

605
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,000
It'll be a real circus.

606
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,000
- Don't let these people keep you

607
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:30,466
from being a good cop, Harry.

608
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:33,433
From doing your job, you understand me?

609
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:34,266
- Yes sir.

610
00:30:38,866 --> 00:30:39,766
Lieutenant?

611
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,166
I'm real sorry about what happened.

612
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,000
Maybe you oughta go home, get yourself some sleep.

613
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:53,500
- Yeah.

614
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,133
- Vicki Sherry lived with her 10-year-old son Tommy

615
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,000
in this pricey Malibu beach house,

616
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:04,900
which she received as part of her divorce settlement

617
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:06,366
from Coach Matt Sherry.

618
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,100
- Police had apparently been to this residence before

619
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:13,200
in response to 911 emergency calls from Vicki Sherry.

620
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:15,166
- Coach Sherry maintains a mansion in Bel-Air

621
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,566
reportedly worth more than $5 million,

622
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,266
that house is a good 20-minute drive from the murder site.

623
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,966
- Police investigators have returned

624
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,200
to this Malibu beach house murder scene

625
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:25,700
looking for any physical evidence

626
00:31:25,733 --> 00:31:27,200
that might tie Coach Matt Sherry

627
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:29,400
to the brutal murder of his ex-wife.

628
00:31:29,433 --> 00:31:31,966
Roberto, bank that, we'll pick it up in a minute, come on.

629
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,233
Lieutenant Hunter!

630
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,333
Lieutenant Hunter, is it true you were

631
00:31:34,366 --> 00:31:35,866
engaged to the victim?

632
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,466
- No comment.

633
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,500
- Channel three happen to know

634
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:40,266
you were engaged to Vicki Sherry.

635
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,300
- What is your name?

636
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,433
- Sally Vogel.

637
00:31:42,466 --> 00:31:44,366
- You have a stupid job, Sally.

638
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,400
And get that out of my face.

639
00:31:47,433 --> 00:31:51,533
- Mr. Sherry is a suspect in this case, but only a suspect.

640
00:31:51,566 --> 00:31:53,400
Now, he's been asked not to leave the city,

641
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:56,266
and his attorney has voluntarily given us his passport.

642
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,666
- Is it true that Coach Sherry

643
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,300
had an argument with his ex-wife the night of the murder?

644
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,500
- I will not comment on what went on

645
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:02,900
between the two individuals.

646
00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:04,333
- There have been reports that Coach Sherry

647
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:06,066
had previously been charged with spousal abuse

648
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,833
and that those records were sealed.

649
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:09,566
- Yeah, well, if the records were sealed

650
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,433
I couldn't possibly comment on them, now could I?

651
00:32:11,466 --> 00:32:12,600
- Well then they do exist.

652
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:13,933
- I have no comment on that.

653
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,566
I've got time for two more questions.

654
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,933
- Will his popularity affect your case?

655
00:32:16,966 --> 00:32:17,866
- [Frank] I have no comment on that.

656
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,133
- Is he the only suspect?

657
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:20,466
- [Frank] I have no comment, Mr. Brody.

658
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:30,833
- Pete, how you doing?

659
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:31,700
- Oh, not bad.

660
00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:33,566
Considering.

661
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,533
Her sister's taking it really hard.

662
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,166
- How's Tommy doing?

663
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,300
- Well.

664
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:47,600
Matt came up to see him, and...

665
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:52,900
Did he kill my baby?

666
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,700
And when he was here, he swore he didn't do it.

667
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:04,666
I know he loved her.

668
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:08,533
Well, they had problems, but I can't believe

669
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:09,900
he'd do anything like this.

670
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:14,533
I can't believe she's gone.

671
00:33:16,766 --> 00:33:17,600
- [Tommy] Rick.

672
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,933
- Tommy.

673
00:33:22,766 --> 00:33:25,366
(gentle music)

674
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:38,300
(horse whinnying)

675
00:33:43,066 --> 00:33:46,733
- They said on TV that my dad killed my mom.

676
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,166
I know that's not true.

677
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
My dad loved my mom.

678
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,366
You loved her too, didn't you?

679
00:33:57,266 --> 00:33:59,100
- Yes, Tommy, very much.

680
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:09,266
- One night, a man had a dream

681
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,799
that he was walking along the beach with the lord.

682
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:16,433
Across the sky, flashed scenes from his life.

683
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,466
For each scene, he noticed two sets

684
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,900
of footprints in the sand.

685
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:27,433
One belonged to him, and the other to the lord.

686
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:31,500
But during the most troublesome periods,

687
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:33,366
there was only one set of footprints.

688
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:37,600
He asked the lord, "why would you leave me

689
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:38,900
"when I needed you most?"

690
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,166
The lord said to the man, "my precious, precious child,

691
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:48,033
"I love you, and I would never leave you

692
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:50,166
"during the times of trial and suffering.

693
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,033
"When you see only one set of footprints,

694
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,733
"it was then that I carried you."

695
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:09,966
- I'll take Jenny home.

696
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
(helicopter whirring)

697
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:15,700
(siren wailing)

698
00:35:21,566 --> 00:35:23,233
- Hello, Pat. - Rick.

699
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,066
I am so sorry.

700
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,933
- Thank you.

701
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:30,466
- You know if there's anything I can do.

702
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,233
- You can get rid of that press for me.

703
00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:34,033
- Yeah, well, I fought it, but

704
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:36,166
every other station's here, so.

705
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,000
- Besides, it's a good story, right?

706
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:41,366
- Call me?

707
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,133
I'm around if you wanna talk.

708
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,000
- Okay.

709
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:50,766
- I can't believe he has the nerve to show up here.

710
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:55,033
- Sorry, do I know you?

711
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:55,900
- Yeah.

712
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:58,766
I was a friend of Vicki's from the gym.

713
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:00,933
I'm so sorry.

714
00:36:03,366 --> 00:36:05,700
You have to bring the man who did this to justice.

715
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,633
(solemn music)

716
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,366
(solemn music)

717
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:48,466
- Hunter, I been looking for you,

718
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,733
I finally got this report on the Kincaid case.

719
00:36:49,766 --> 00:36:51,200
- Finally, put it on my desk, Lewis.

720
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:52,366
By the way, where's your partner?

721
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,233
- Grand jury.

722
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:55,833
On your desk? - Yeah, on the desk.

723
00:36:58,566 --> 00:37:01,000
- An interesting twist in the Matt Sherry case

724
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:04,266
as sources confirm that Vicki Sherry, the murder victim,

725
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,600
was engaged to be married to Rick Hunter,

726
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:09,133
a lieutenant in the Los Angeles police department.

727
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,533
It is believed that that announcement

728
00:37:10,566 --> 00:37:12,666
of their impending marriage may have triggered

729
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,000
Matt Sherry's actions the night of the murder.

730
00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:18,933
- Lieutenant. - Harry.

731
00:37:18,966 --> 00:37:20,366
You got a minute? - Always.

732
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:22,933
- Battaglia have a case there?

733
00:37:22,966 --> 00:37:24,666
- Judging by the TV coverage and the media,

734
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,966
yeah, absolutely.

735
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,800
- I mean does he have hard evidence?

736
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:29,066
- Well, no, no.

737
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,833
But what he's trying to do is get the grand jury

738
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:32,833
to indict with what we have right now.

739
00:37:32,866 --> 00:37:34,000
- That's good.

740
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:35,900
- Well no, not necessarily, no,

741
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:37,633
since everybody knows that Frank's been trying

742
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,400
to build this case in the press,

743
00:37:39,433 --> 00:37:40,833
and all he's gotta do is just push it

744
00:37:40,866 --> 00:37:42,600
just a little bit further and public opinion's

745
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:44,100
going the other way.

746
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:48,233
And sir, I mean, I don't know if you're aware of this,

747
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,166
but Frank's the one who leaked the information

748
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,633
about spousal abuse to that reporter, Sally Vogel?

749
00:37:53,666 --> 00:37:54,833
- Battaglia did that?

750
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:56,566
- Yes sir, and I can tell you where and when.

751
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,633
How about midnight at the Bel-Air Hotel.

752
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,600
Rumor around here says that Sally and Frank

753
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:02,200
have been going out for almost a year.

754
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:04,200
So hard evidence or not, Matt Sherry's gonna be

755
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:06,033
a tough guy to convict in this town.

756
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:12,300
- Why hasn't my client been arrested?

757
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,633
And why are they taking this to the grand jury

758
00:38:14,666 --> 00:38:16,166
and not a preliminary hearing?

759
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,166
I'll tell you why, because they don't want us there.

760
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,133
My client is innocent, and when that is made clear,

761
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,000
this city is going to have to pay

762
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:25,766
for damaging the reptutation of a national here.

763
00:38:26,966 --> 00:38:28,433
Thank you, that'll be all for today, folks.

764
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:31,633
(reporters shouting)

765
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:32,666
Lieutenant Hunter.

766
00:38:33,866 --> 00:38:36,533
Sorry about your loss, it's a terrible tragedy.

767
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:38,000
- Thank you very much.

768
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:39,300
- Look, I know you think Matt Sherry

769
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,833
killed his ex-wife, he didn't.

770
00:38:43,966 --> 00:38:45,733
- Let me ask you something, Counselor.

771
00:38:45,766 --> 00:38:47,200
How much money does it take to get off

772
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:48,266
after you've murdered somebody?

773
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,466
A million, $2 million?

774
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,700
All the killer has?

775
00:38:51,733 --> 00:38:53,033
What is it, the sliding scale or what?

776
00:38:53,066 --> 00:38:56,733
- Lieutenant, there was no weapon, no witnesses,

777
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:59,300
none of Matt Sherry's blood was found at the crime scene,

778
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:00,833
you don't even have enough for an indictment,

779
00:39:00,866 --> 00:39:02,333
much less a conviction.

780
00:39:02,366 --> 00:39:03,833
- A conviction?

781
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:06,000
You can't convict anybody in this town of anything anymore.

782
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:08,500
No, let me tell you about Los Angeles, Counselor.

783
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:10,533
Two brothers decide to murder their rich parents

784
00:39:10,566 --> 00:39:14,433
in cold blood, they confess, no problem,

785
00:39:14,466 --> 00:39:16,433
as long as they do it in LA, no conviction.

786
00:39:16,466 --> 00:39:17,866
Two punks decide to throw a brick

787
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,833
through a truck driver's head during a riot.

788
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:22,166
No problems, as long as the riot's in Los Angeles.

789
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,333
- Lieutenant-- - No, four police officers

790
00:39:24,366 --> 00:39:27,733
are caught on videotape beating a black motorist.

791
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,566
Turns into a race issue.

792
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,400
They're tried twice.

793
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:35,166
They're convicted of violating his civil rights?

794
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,833
No, the truth is, Counselor, everybody walks in LA.

795
00:39:40,966 --> 00:39:42,333
- Very well.

796
00:39:42,366 --> 00:39:43,866
I'll see you in court, Hunter.

797
00:39:57,466 --> 00:39:59,066
- I'm bringing in Jerry Lands from Dallas

798
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,266
and Jack Garrett from New York, he's a DNA expert.

799
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,200
I've gotta call in Dershowitz in case we have to

800
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:05,566
appeal a conviction, and I've hired

801
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,733
Bernard Daly Bernard to do the PR.

802
00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:09,600
- I have a publicist.

803
00:40:09,633 --> 00:40:11,700
- Well these guys aren't publicists, Matt,

804
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:13,333
they're opinion makers and spin doctors,

805
00:40:13,366 --> 00:40:15,033
and that's just what we need right now.

806
00:40:15,066 --> 00:40:16,400
(horn honking)

807
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:17,900
- Michael, I didn't kill her.

808
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:22,666
- Of course you didn't, Matt.

809
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:31,033
(phones ringing) (people chattering)

810
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:33,800
- Hold all my calls, Lucille.

811
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:41,033
(door closes)

812
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:53,566
(solemn music)

813
00:41:20,766 --> 00:41:23,666
(mysterious music)

814
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,566
- This is Sally Vogel reporting live

815
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,933
from the mansion of Coach Matt Sherry in Bel-Air,

816
00:41:37,966 --> 00:41:40,566
where friends, neighbors, and even total strangers

817
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,666
continue to express their grief and outrage

818
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,366
over the brutal murder of Coach Sherry's

819
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,966
estranged wife, Vicki.

820
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,833
Everyone seems to have an opinion in this bizarre case,

821
00:41:48,866 --> 00:41:50,833
which has captured the imaginations of

822
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:52,000
not only Los Angeles,

823
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:53,866
but of the entire nation.

824
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,400
- He did it, man, he did it.

825
00:41:55,433 --> 00:41:58,466
He was pumped up on Jones and he wasted her, you know?

826
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,633
If you ask me, I think it was drug-related.

827
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:02,933
That's just my own personal theory.

828
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:04,400
- He was abusing her.

829
00:42:04,433 --> 00:42:06,366
He was jealous that she was engaged

830
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,200
to this police officer, and he went wild.

831
00:42:09,233 --> 00:42:11,766
I don't care if he's President of the United States,

832
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,633
if he did it, then he should go to jail.

833
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,266
- No, Matt Sherry is a winner.

834
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,366
I've always liked him, on the court, off the court,

835
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,433
there's no way he's gonna foul out of a game like that.

836
00:42:21,433 --> 00:42:23,066
Trust me, he didn't do it.

837
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,800
- Thanks for your time. - My pleasure.

838
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:28,866
- Just what we need, more hero worshipers like that guy.

839
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:33,033
Oh, find me a yuppie who can't believe he did it.

840
00:42:33,066 --> 00:42:34,933
- Jeez, can you believe these people?

841
00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:36,566
- You watch, he'll get off.

842
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,000
All the defense'll need is one juror who's a fan

843
00:42:39,033 --> 00:42:39,966
to get a hung jury.

844
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,800
Santa Claus could be a mass murderer

845
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:44,266
and he'd walk if he did the crime

846
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,433
wearing the little red suit.

847
00:42:46,466 --> 00:42:48,766
- You are a fountain of insight, Miss Vogel.

848
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,600
(both chuckle)

849
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:50,800
- Come on, next victim.

850
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:54,000
- Okay, now, I mean, it amazes me

851
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:56,366
anybody could think that this guy is guilty.

852
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,600
You look at him.

853
00:42:57,633 --> 00:42:59,166
I mean, he's got amazing charisma,

854
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,733
he's a sharp guy, every guy I know wants to be Matt Sherry.

855
00:43:03,766 --> 00:43:05,066
I mean, think about it, really.

856
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,166
He's rich, he's successful, he's a nice guy,

857
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,400
everyone loves him.

858
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,600
Why would he be so stupid as to throw away

859
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:14,066
his life like that?

860
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,400
No way, not the coach, absolutely no way.

861
00:43:17,433 --> 00:43:20,033
(solemn music)

862
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:54,100
- [Sally] Once again looking for any physical evidence

863
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:55,966
that might tie Coach Matt Sherry

864
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,500
to the brutal murder of his ex-wife.

865
00:43:58,533 --> 00:43:59,800
- Excuse me.

866
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,400
- Just a minute, I'm really into this.

867
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:02,700
- [Sally] Lieutenant Hunter, Lieutenant Hunter.

868
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:04,200
- No comment.

869
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:05,566
- [Sally] Is it true that you were engaged to the victim?

870
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,800
- I'm Lieutenant Hunter, LAPD.

871
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:10,133
- Oh, hey, you're the cop--

872
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:12,266
- That's right, that's me.

873
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,533
Like to ask you a couple questions about Rachel Kincaid?

874
00:44:15,566 --> 00:44:17,566
- Oh god, that poor thing.

875
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,266
- Now when you were questioned the day after the murder,

876
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,433
you said that you were off that night.

877
00:44:21,466 --> 00:44:23,833
- Yeah, I had the flu, I was out a couple days.

878
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:27,533
- Ever see that man before?

879
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,166
- I don't think so.

880
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,466
- [Rick] You're sure?

881
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,866
I mean, he wasn't working out here,

882
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,933
he wasn't outside hanging around, any place?

883
00:44:34,966 --> 00:44:36,166
- No.

884
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,100
But we get a lot of people in here

885
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,400
'cause we're open all night.

886
00:44:39,366 --> 00:44:40,200
- I see.

887
00:44:41,533 --> 00:44:42,700
Did you know Vicki Sherry?

888
00:44:42,733 --> 00:44:43,800
- Only from TV.

889
00:44:45,133 --> 00:44:46,666
When did you put on the guard?

890
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,000
- Well, the next day after Rachel got killed.

891
00:44:50,033 --> 00:44:51,700
- Would it be possible to get a complete

892
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:52,933
membership list from here?

893
00:44:52,966 --> 00:44:54,666
- Sure, no problem.

894
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,866
Mind if I ask you a question?

895
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,933
Why haven't you arrested Matt Sherry?

896
00:44:58,966 --> 00:45:00,633
I mean, everyone knows he did it.

897
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:04,666
(solemn music)

898
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:25,133
(phone ringing)

899
00:45:26,033 --> 00:45:28,200
(line ringing)

900
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:29,033
- [Rick] Hello?

901
00:45:29,066 --> 00:45:30,100
- Lieutenant Hunter.

902
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:32,566
What brings you out so late?

903
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:35,266
- Who's this?

904
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,333
- Just a friend with a mutual interest.

905
00:45:37,366 --> 00:45:40,400
Catching the killer of Vicki Sherry and Rachel Kincaid.

906
00:45:41,966 --> 00:45:43,266
- Yeah, what do you want?

907
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,866
- I just want to express my condolences,

908
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,700
I mean, Vicki was a lovely woman.

909
00:45:46,733 --> 00:45:49,400
She looked so cute in that red Stanford T-shirt.

910
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:52,100
See, that's what she was wearing when I came to the door.

911
00:45:52,133 --> 00:45:53,933
Let me think, was that in the newspaper?

912
00:45:53,966 --> 00:45:55,733
You know, not that I recall.

913
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:58,533
- Hey, who the hell are you?

914
00:45:58,566 --> 00:46:01,233
- Everybody's gonna know my name before this is over.

915
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:05,433
I'm gonna be famous, just like you.

916
00:46:05,466 --> 00:46:07,033
- Where are you?

917
00:46:07,066 --> 00:46:08,300
- You'll figure that out.

918
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,533
- [Rick] Hey, who are you?

919
00:46:10,566 --> 00:46:12,900
What do you know about Vicki Sherry?

920
00:46:12,933 --> 00:46:16,700
(suspenseful music)

921
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:19,900
(gunshot bangs)

922
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:22,333
(gun clicks)

923
00:46:29,866 --> 00:46:31,933
- [Charlie] Vicki's death is tied to this Rachel Kincaid

924
00:46:31,966 --> 00:46:33,200
and the guy confessed on the phone?

925
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:34,566
- [Rick] That's what he said.

926
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,066
- Well, you know what you're saying,

927
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,266
you're saying that Matt Sherry didn't kill Vicki.

928
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,666
- It looks that way, Charlie.

929
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,433
- I wonder what Battaglia's gonna tell the grand jury now.

930
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,366
- Well, I don't know, but it should be interesting.

931
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,600
- Captain, the uniforms did find one shell casing

932
00:46:47,633 --> 00:46:49,866
from a 308 on the roof of the gym.

933
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,166
- They're running ballistics now.

934
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,566
- I think we oughta close that gym down,

935
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,400
at least temporarily.

936
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:54,600
- That's a good idea.

937
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:56,266
Stan, how'd this guy find my number?

938
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,766
- Probably scanned off of ESN.

939
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,266
We can put a trace on your line,

940
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,000
triangulate it if he calls again.

941
00:47:01,033 --> 00:47:03,633
- Lieutenant, piece of cake on the sailors.

942
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:05,800
- Good, let's do that, huh?

943
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,066
This is our boy.

944
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,100
Run that through NCI computers.

945
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:10,533
Find out everything you can on this guy.

946
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:13,300
Harry, we got a lot of work to do, let's go.

947
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:16,800
(siren wailing) (people chattering)

948
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,633
(reporters shouting)

949
00:47:19,666 --> 00:47:21,100
- Lieutenant Hunter!

950
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:22,600
Assuming Matt Sherry's indicted,

951
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,200
do you think the DA should push for the death penalty?

952
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:25,666
- Let me tell you something, Sally,

953
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,900
everybody has a right to a fair trial.

954
00:47:27,933 --> 00:47:29,733
That takes place in the courts,

955
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:32,366
not on network television, not on CNN.

956
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,966
Matt Sherry hasn't even been indicted yet,

957
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,066
and you people have him packing his bags for San Quentin.

958
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,100
- But Lieutenant Hunter--

959
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:38,600
- Just a sec.

960
00:47:38,633 --> 00:47:40,333
- That sounds strange coming from the fiance of the victim.

961
00:47:40,366 --> 00:47:41,800
- I'm still a police officer.

962
00:47:42,966 --> 00:47:46,466
You do your jobs, let us do ours.

963
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,733
(people chattering)

964
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:50,933
- All right, let's call Pat Lafferty at the station

965
00:47:50,966 --> 00:47:52,933
and get that six o'clock lead slot cleared.

966
00:47:52,966 --> 00:47:56,000
Woo, we just won the sound byte of the month.

967
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,300
- [Pat] How do you like being the center

968
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:04,433
of all this attention?

969
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,133
- Well, I don't, Pat.

970
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,233
I wish you people would keep my picture the hell off the TV,

971
00:48:08,266 --> 00:48:09,766
make my job a lot easier.

972
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,900
- It's your 15 minutes, Rick.

973
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:13,166
- How's that?

974
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,666
- Andy Warhol, you know, he predicted

975
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,233
all of us would eventually have 15 minutes of fame.

976
00:48:17,266 --> 00:48:18,266
- He's dead, isn't he?

977
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,666
- Yes, he is.

978
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,066
But his 15 minutes came before he died.

979
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,266
- Ms. Lafferty, with all due respect,

980
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,600
I don't understand how you people

981
00:48:24,633 --> 00:48:26,400
are allowed to just say whatever you want

982
00:48:26,433 --> 00:48:28,566
and then chalk it up to a police informant

983
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,866
or an unknown source.

984
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,433
- Because that's the way they want it.

985
00:48:31,466 --> 00:48:32,700
- Right, who's they?

986
00:48:32,733 --> 00:48:34,033
- The lawyers, the police department,

987
00:48:34,066 --> 00:48:35,600
you guys wouldn't believe the stuff

988
00:48:35,633 --> 00:48:38,433
that's being leaked to us every day on this case.

989
00:48:38,466 --> 00:48:40,466
- [Rick] Like the DA's office leaking sealed documents

990
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,866
on Matt Sherry's arrest?

991
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,300
- Now you're fishing, Rick.

992
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:44,600
- Am I?

993
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:45,800
- Sorry to interrupt.

994
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:47,500
Larry, I need you to pull up the raw footage

995
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:49,266
on the Sherry file, I think it's on eight.

996
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,433
- Yeah, sure, give me five seconds.

997
00:48:51,466 --> 00:48:52,666
- Lieutenant Hunter.

998
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:53,933
Taking the studio tour?

999
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:57,733
- No, actually I thought I'd just come by and see you.

1000
00:48:57,766 --> 00:49:00,233
- Oh, well good, you can watch the news with me.

1001
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:03,033
You're the lead story at six o'clock.

1002
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:07,733
(people chattering)

1003
00:49:07,766 --> 00:49:08,900
- Let me tell you something, Sally,

1004
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:10,266
everybody has a right to a fair trial.

1005
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,366
But that takes place in the courts,

1006
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,133
not on network television or CNN.

1007
00:49:14,166 --> 00:49:16,166
Now, Matt Sherry hasn't even been indicted yet,

1008
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,933
and you people have him packing his bags for San Quentin.

1009
00:49:18,966 --> 00:49:20,666
- But Lieutenant Hunter-- - Just a second.

1010
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,833
- [Sally] That sounds a little strange

1011
00:49:21,866 --> 00:49:23,933
coming from the fiance of the victim.

1012
00:49:23,966 --> 00:49:25,266
- Still a police officer.

1013
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:29,366
You do your jobs, let us do ours.

1014
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,366
- Do you have to run that?

1015
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,966
- Did you have to say it?

1016
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,400
- Here's your funeral stuff.

1017
00:49:36,866 --> 00:49:39,866
(people chattering)

1018
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,066
- Yeah, that's him.

1019
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:50,266
- Back it up, Larry.

1020
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,833
- Backing it up, fasten your seat belts.

1021
00:49:55,066 --> 00:49:56,033
- I know that face.

1022
00:49:57,966 --> 00:49:59,333
- How?

1023
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:01,333
- I did a pop of him yesterday at the Sherry mansion.

1024
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:05,900
Something about fouling out of the game.

1025
00:50:05,933 --> 00:50:07,400
- Could I see that?

1026
00:50:07,433 --> 00:50:09,333
- Yeah, Larry, pull last night's 11 o'clock piece,

1027
00:50:09,366 --> 00:50:10,866
the one we fed to the network?

1028
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,233
- [Larry] Yeah, you got it.

1029
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,833
(tape rewinding)

1030
00:50:14,866 --> 00:50:16,100
- What's going on?

1031
00:50:16,133 --> 00:50:17,900
- He's executing a court order, Sally,

1032
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:19,200
that's all I can tell you.

1033
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:23,166
- [Sally] A court order on the Matt Sherry case?

1034
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,666
- You do ask an awful lot of questions, don't you?

1035
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,866
- That's why they pay me the moderate bucks.

1036
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:35,766
- No, Matt Sherry is a winner, I've always liked him,

1037
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,133
on the court, off the court, there's no way

1038
00:50:37,166 --> 00:50:39,266
he's gonna foul out of the game like that.

1039
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:41,466
Trust me, he didn't do it.

1040
00:50:42,966 --> 00:50:43,766
- Harry?

1041
00:50:45,466 --> 00:50:47,666
I want to know everything I can about that guy.

1042
00:50:58,466 --> 00:50:59,900
- Yes!

1043
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:01,233
Gotcha, pay up.

1044
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,766
- Two out of three.

1045
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,366
- This is for the championship of the world.

1046
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,400
That's never two out of three.

1047
00:51:07,966 --> 00:51:09,000
- All right, champ.

1048
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:12,066
Come on, I'll buy you a soda over there, huh?

1049
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,666
- Can you explain something about hockey to me?

1050
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,800
- Well, if it's about the strike, Tommy,

1051
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:17,066
I don't think I can.

1052
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,033
- No, no, I understand that.

1053
00:51:19,066 --> 00:51:21,466
That's just people being greedy.

1054
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,700
What I don't get is off-sides.

1055
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:25,200
- In hockey? - Yeah.

1056
00:51:25,233 --> 00:51:26,666
Could you straighten that out for me?

1057
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:27,766
- Yeah, sure.

1058
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,766
Off-sides in hockey.

1059
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,466
When a guy wants to take a shot

1060
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,233
when he's past the blue line, I think it's a blue line.

1061
00:51:34,266 --> 00:51:37,000
Anyway, there has to be a guy between him and the goal.

1062
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:39,566
- But the goalie's between him and the goal.

1063
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,666
- I know, there's gotta be another guy, though.

1064
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,933
(phone ringing) - Why?

1065
00:51:42,966 --> 00:51:45,966
- Well, I don't know, I think it's something

1066
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,833
that some Canadian figured out a long time ago, huh?

1067
00:51:48,866 --> 00:51:50,033
Excuse me.

1068
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:50,933
Yeah, Hunter.

1069
00:51:50,966 --> 00:51:52,433
- Lieutenant.

1070
00:51:52,466 --> 00:51:55,733
Turns out Jack Valko is the name that goes with the face.

1071
00:51:55,766 --> 00:51:58,000
I got an address on him over here in Westwood,

1072
00:51:58,033 --> 00:51:59,900
his sister's old apartment.

1073
00:51:59,933 --> 00:52:01,900
Now why don't I meet you in front of the Village Theater?

1074
00:52:01,933 --> 00:52:03,366
- All right, Harry, good work.

1075
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,433
Give me 25 minutes, I'll meet you there.

1076
00:52:05,466 --> 00:52:08,833
(people chattering)

1077
00:52:08,866 --> 00:52:11,433
(horn honking)

1078
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:17,000
(reporters shouting)

1079
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,133
- [Reporter] Lieutenant Hunter, we're live!

1080
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:19,166
Do you have a statement? - Open the gate!

1081
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,200
(people chattering)

1082
00:52:25,866 --> 00:52:26,800
- [Reporter] Come on, now!

1083
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:28,900
Come on, we got a job to do!

1084
00:52:28,933 --> 00:52:29,866
- [Man] For crying out loud.

1085
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,400
- [Reporter] Lieutenant Hunter!

1086
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:35,766
- Hey, kiddo, how was the pier?

1087
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,233
- It was awesome.

1088
00:52:37,266 --> 00:52:39,433
Me and Rick must have played every game in the place.

1089
00:52:39,466 --> 00:52:40,266
It was great, wasn't it, Rick?

1090
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,166
- Sure was, Tommy.

1091
00:52:42,466 --> 00:52:43,566
Thanks son.

1092
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,533
- I had a great time.

1093
00:52:44,566 --> 00:52:45,466
Thank you. - Thank you.

1094
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:47,266
Matt.

1095
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:51,133
I know what this ordeal has done to you.

1096
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,733
- You have no idea what it's done to me.

1097
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,200
- Hang in there.

1098
00:53:02,066 --> 00:53:03,166
- What does that mean?

1099
00:53:04,633 --> 00:53:07,200
(solemn music)

1100
00:53:19,233 --> 00:53:21,800
(horn honking)

1101
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,600
- What do you got, Harry?

1102
00:53:27,633 --> 00:53:30,766
- Jack Valko, no car, no DMV.

1103
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,433
Served seven years for a killing up in Seattle.

1104
00:53:33,466 --> 00:53:34,933
Used a knife.

1105
00:53:34,966 --> 00:53:36,900
The warden up at Walla-Walla says that our boy'd do

1106
00:53:36,933 --> 00:53:39,933
just about anything to get his face on TV.

1107
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,766
Hunger strikes, prisoner's rights, you name it.

1108
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,133
Oh, and get this, one time he incited a near-riot

1109
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:50,133
over the viewing privileges of a TV show called Cops

1110
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:51,766
in the convicts' lounge.

1111
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,333
Oh no, he's just a stand-up guy.

1112
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:54,933
I mean, he's a gem.

1113
00:53:54,966 --> 00:53:58,766
I mean, evidently, he derives some kind of perverse pleasure

1114
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,666
out of all this lurid media coverage.

1115
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,833
- Don't we all.

1116
00:54:01,866 --> 00:54:03,766
- Well yeah, but Valko's shrink told us

1117
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,566
that he's just doing all this stuff for a little attention.

1118
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,833
He actually wants to get caught.

1119
00:54:08,866 --> 00:54:10,400
- Well, if he actually wants to get caught,

1120
00:54:10,433 --> 00:54:12,500
why doesn't he just turn himself in?

1121
00:54:12,533 --> 00:54:16,700
(people chattering on television)

1122
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:32,933
Harry.

1123
00:54:32,966 --> 00:54:33,800
- Clear, Hunter.

1124
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:39,033
Look at this, Lieutenant.

1125
00:54:40,233 --> 00:54:42,833
Valko's got himself two police scanners.

1126
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:43,700
Whole routine.

1127
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:46,433
- This guy's sick.

1128
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:02,833
(phone ringing)

1129
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,766
Hello.

1130
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,200
- Welcome to my humble home.

1131
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:19,666
- Silent alarm?

1132
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,533
- Very good.

1133
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:23,266
- I'm impressed, Jack, can you tell?

1134
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,700
- Oh, you know my name, huh?

1135
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,066
- [Rick] Oh, I know all about you,

1136
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,000
Jack, your TV appearances.

1137
00:55:30,033 --> 00:55:31,500
- You know I saw you on TV, Hunter,

1138
00:55:31,533 --> 00:55:34,033
standing up for the rights of the accused, very noble.

1139
00:55:34,066 --> 00:55:36,233
- And I saw you too, Jack.

1140
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,766
Standing out in front of Matt Sherry's mansion.

1141
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,600
- I thought I came off rather well, don't you?

1142
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:45,100
Passionate, distinct, great flair for metaphor?

1143
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,266
- Oh, I don't know, I think you come off better in person.

1144
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,633
- Ah, Vicki's funeral, yeah.

1145
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:52,700
I'm glad we had a chance to meet.

1146
00:55:53,866 --> 00:55:55,600
- We should do it again sometime.

1147
00:55:55,633 --> 00:55:57,866
- So why did you close down my gym, Hunter?

1148
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,833
I'm concerned about those beautiful women,

1149
00:55:59,866 --> 00:56:01,433
how are they gonna stay in shape?

1150
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,100
- Why'd you pick that place, Jack?

1151
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:10,766
- Because all the nice ones work out at night.

1152
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,866
I gotta go.

1153
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,733
- Jack.

1154
00:56:14,233 --> 00:56:17,700
When I do get my hands on you, there's not gonna be

1155
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:19,766
any speeches for the rights of criminals.

1156
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:22,966
(phone clicks)

1157
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:23,800
Harry?

1158
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,633
- We got him.

1159
00:56:32,466 --> 00:56:35,466
(people chattering)

1160
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,700
- [Reporter] Lieutenant Hunter, Channel 6 News.

1161
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:37,600
Do you have any significant leads?

1162
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:38,633
- Thank you very much.

1163
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:39,833
Excuse me.

1164
00:56:39,866 --> 00:56:41,033
- [Reporter] Lieutenant Hunter, excuse me,

1165
00:56:41,066 --> 00:56:44,300
I'll just ask you one question, please.

1166
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,200
(intercom buzzes)

1167
00:56:50,233 --> 00:56:51,700
- Yeah?

1168
00:56:51,733 --> 00:56:53,100
- [Receptionist] Lieutenant Hunter's here to see you, sir.

1169
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:57,100
- All right, send him in.

1170
00:56:57,133 --> 00:56:59,166
(knocking on door)

1171
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,700
Well, Lieutenant Hunter, come on in,

1172
00:57:00,733 --> 00:57:03,033
I've got a few minutes before my next press conference.

1173
00:57:03,066 --> 00:57:05,600
Lorraine, this is Rick Hunter, Lorraine.

1174
00:57:05,633 --> 00:57:06,433
- Lorraine.

1175
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,100
- Listen, first of all, Rick.

1176
00:57:09,133 --> 00:57:11,433
I'd like to express my condolences.

1177
00:57:11,466 --> 00:57:13,100
I know how close you two were and about

1178
00:57:13,133 --> 00:57:15,000
your plans for the future.

1179
00:57:15,033 --> 00:57:16,233
Listen, I want you to understand

1180
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,933
that this whole Matt Sherry matter

1181
00:57:17,966 --> 00:57:19,633
is a lose-lose situation for me.

1182
00:57:19,666 --> 00:57:21,133
- Yeah, how's that?

1183
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:22,566
- Well, if he goes to jail, I'll never get reelected,

1184
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,033
much less run for higher office,

1185
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,000
and if he walks, the whole country'll be crying,

1186
00:57:26,033 --> 00:57:28,533
"no justice for the rich."

1187
00:57:28,566 --> 00:57:30,933
- No, actually, it's a win-win for you.

1188
00:57:30,966 --> 00:57:33,266
You see, no matter what happens to Matt Sherry,

1189
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,400
it's good for Frank Battaglia.

1190
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,833
And besides, Frank, Matt Sherry didn't do it.

1191
00:57:43,433 --> 00:57:45,900
I have a very strong lead on another suspect.

1192
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,933
(intercom buzzes)

1193
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:50,166
- What!

1194
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,400
- [Reporter] The press is waiting for you, sir,

1195
00:57:51,433 --> 00:57:52,800
they've assembled in the rotunda area.

1196
00:57:53,866 --> 00:57:54,700
- I'm on my way.

1197
00:57:56,533 --> 00:57:59,200
Well what the hell do you want me to do, Hunter?

1198
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:02,466
- I wouldn't let public opinion dictate my actions, Frank.

1199
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,766
And I'd be very, very careful of what I say

1200
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,400
to certain members of the press.

1201
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:14,666
Fix him up good, Lorraine, he looks a little pale.

1202
00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:17,700
- No.

1203
00:58:19,433 --> 00:58:21,200
(dispatcher chattering on radio)

1204
00:58:21,233 --> 00:58:22,333
- There's three there.

1205
00:58:26,366 --> 00:58:27,400
Why don't you check it out?

1206
00:58:27,433 --> 00:58:28,266
- Can do.

1207
00:58:32,066 --> 00:58:35,066
(people chattering)

1208
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,866
(bicycle bell ringing)

1209
00:58:51,533 --> 00:58:52,333
- That's it.

1210
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:53,433
That's our boy's phone.

1211
00:58:53,466 --> 00:58:54,800
555-7295.

1212
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,266
(solemn music)

1213
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:09,533
- Let's make that call now.

1214
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,000
- This is four-king-20, requesting you proceed

1215
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:18,866
with the crime broadcast, repeating it every 30 seconds.

1216
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,566
Repeating it every 30 seconds, out.

1217
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,433
- [Dispatcher] I roger, four-king-20.

1218
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:27,333
- Hope he's listening to the police scanner.

1219
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:30,600
- He's listening, all right.

1220
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:33,100
- [Dispatcher] All units in the vicinity of Ocean Front Walk

1221
00:59:33,133 --> 00:59:35,833
in Venice, APB for suspect Jack Valko,

1222
00:59:35,866 --> 00:59:39,700
V for Valko, white male, 35, five-11, 170,

1223
00:59:39,733 --> 00:59:42,000
suspect wanted in multiple murders,

1224
00:59:42,033 --> 00:59:44,433
is believed to be a dimwitted media freak,

1225
00:59:44,466 --> 00:59:46,766
a miserable pedophile, a sexual deviant,

1226
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,333
and a general no-class low-life piece of pond scum.

1227
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:58,766
(dispatcher chattering on radio)

1228
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:05,200
(tense music)

1229
01:00:13,966 --> 01:00:14,866
- That him?

1230
01:00:17,566 --> 01:00:19,133
- Yeah, that's him.

1231
01:00:22,266 --> 01:00:23,633
- Get outta here!

1232
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:27,366
(phone ringing)

1233
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,700
(dispatcher chattering)

1234
01:00:29,733 --> 01:00:31,200
- Hello, Jack.

1235
01:00:31,233 --> 01:00:32,466
- What the hell is that crap on the radio, Hunter?

1236
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,433
I thought we had a relationship here.

1237
01:00:34,466 --> 01:00:35,700
- Don't be so sensitive.

1238
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:37,866
We have a relationship.

1239
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,000
After all, you are wanted for murder.

1240
01:00:40,033 --> 01:00:41,200
- I'll just get a good lawyer,

1241
01:00:41,233 --> 01:00:42,833
that's all you need in LA, you know?

1242
01:00:42,866 --> 01:00:46,233
- Now look, Jack, my partner would like

1243
01:00:46,266 --> 01:00:47,366
to have a word with you.

1244
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:51,600
- Mr. Valko, hi.

1245
01:00:51,633 --> 01:00:53,066
- I don't wanna talk to you.

1246
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,866
- Hey listen, that was quite an impressive setup

1247
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,666
you had in Westwood there.

1248
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:00,000
Those TVs and VCRs, I mean, truth be told,

1249
01:01:00,033 --> 01:01:01,400
I don't even know how to set a timer.

1250
01:01:01,433 --> 01:01:03,466
- Yeah, put Hunter back on.

1251
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,200
- In two seconds here, I'd just like

1252
01:01:05,233 --> 01:01:09,133
to take this opportunity to ask you a programming question.

1253
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,400
- Where's Hunter!

1254
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:11,633
- [Harry] He'll be right with ya.

1255
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:12,933
Now, I'm the kind of (dramatic music)

1256
01:01:12,966 --> 01:01:14,900
to watch one show while I'm taping.

1257
01:01:14,933 --> 01:01:17,900
(suspenseful music)

1258
01:01:21,533 --> 01:01:24,333
(tires squealing)

1259
01:01:26,066 --> 01:01:27,533
- Hey! - Whoa, hey!

1260
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:46,533
- Four-king-20, officer in pursuit of perp on foot

1261
01:01:46,566 --> 01:01:51,000
heading south of Venice boardwalk, requesting backup.

1262
01:01:57,966 --> 01:01:58,766
(tires squealing)

1263
01:01:58,800 --> 01:01:59,766
Valko!

1264
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,700
(tires squealing)

1265
01:02:02,733 --> 01:02:04,833
(horn honking)

1266
01:02:04,866 --> 01:02:05,666
Come on!

1267
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,300
(horn honking)

1268
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:22,033
Four-king-20, officer still in need of assistance.

1269
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,566
- Get out!

1270
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:27,533
Get out now!

1271
01:02:27,566 --> 01:02:28,400
Move it!

1272
01:02:31,033 --> 01:02:36,033
(tires squealing) (suspenseful music)

1273
01:02:40,066 --> 01:02:41,133
You wanna play, Hunter?

1274
01:02:41,166 --> 01:02:42,100
We'll play!

1275
01:02:43,033 --> 01:02:45,866
(tires squealing)

1276
01:02:54,033 --> 01:02:55,133
- Lieutenant!

1277
01:03:15,733 --> 01:03:17,966
(crashing)

1278
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:42,166
(explosions booming)

1279
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:46,266
(crowd applauding)

1280
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,733
- [Woman On Intercom] Dr. Kahn to OR two.

1281
01:03:59,766 --> 01:04:01,133
- You know what was weird out there today, Charlie,

1282
01:04:01,166 --> 01:04:03,700
people just stood there cheering.

1283
01:04:03,733 --> 01:04:05,000
Didn't seem to make any difference

1284
01:04:05,033 --> 01:04:06,666
that there could've been a man in that car dying.

1285
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,666
It was like some weird perverted stunt show

1286
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:09,900
they were watching.

1287
01:04:09,933 --> 01:04:11,866
They just stood there, applauding.

1288
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,066
- You've become the show, huh?

1289
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,633
Half those people probably recognized you from the tube.

1290
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:19,200
That's the way the world is today.

1291
01:04:19,233 --> 01:04:20,133
Believe me.

1292
01:04:20,166 --> 01:04:21,533
People are sick.

1293
01:04:22,633 --> 01:04:24,733
Listen, you got a minute?

1294
01:04:24,766 --> 01:04:25,766
- [Rick] Yeah, sure.

1295
01:04:33,566 --> 01:04:34,766
- You know, I kinda wish that I'd been out there

1296
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,533
with you guys today, does that sound crazy?

1297
01:04:36,566 --> 01:04:37,400
- [Rick] No.

1298
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:42,533
- Well anyway, started me thinking about the job.

1299
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:46,633
The rewards of doing the job, the department.

1300
01:04:46,666 --> 01:04:48,533
I realized how important it is to me.

1301
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,933
You and I are cops, Hunter.

1302
01:04:52,533 --> 01:04:54,200
That's what we're supposed to be.

1303
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,466
What happened to Vicki made me sort of rethink

1304
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,833
a lot of things in my life.

1305
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,633
And anyway, I've decided I'm not gonna retire.

1306
01:05:06,633 --> 01:05:11,633
I'm in for the long haul, so, let's get this guy.

1307
01:05:22,933 --> 01:05:24,133
- Welcome back, Charlie.

1308
01:05:29,933 --> 01:05:32,200
(people chattering)

1309
01:05:32,233 --> 01:05:34,933
Get Pete Morgan on the phone for me, would you please?

1310
01:05:42,266 --> 01:05:44,766
(light music)

1311
01:05:51,266 --> 01:05:52,700
- [Bartender] Here you go.

1312
01:05:52,733 --> 01:05:53,733
- Thank you.

1313
01:05:57,133 --> 01:05:58,033
Pete, there's something I've been

1314
01:05:58,066 --> 01:05:59,400
wanting to talk to you about.

1315
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,133
And I wanted to tell you personally.

1316
01:06:05,733 --> 01:06:06,533
- What is it?

1317
01:06:07,733 --> 01:06:09,100
- There's been a lot of things said in the press

1318
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:10,633
about Vicki's death and Matt.

1319
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,666
I just want you to hear it from me.

1320
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,633
Matt didn't do it.

1321
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:21,833
- How you know that?

1322
01:06:21,866 --> 01:06:24,200
- Because we have a lead on the guy that did.

1323
01:06:24,233 --> 01:06:25,433
- You sure?

1324
01:06:25,466 --> 01:06:27,833
- Yeah, he's confessed to two killings.

1325
01:06:27,866 --> 01:06:30,833
Vicki's and a woman by the name of Rachel Kincaid.

1326
01:06:32,066 --> 01:06:33,100
- Does Matt know about this?

1327
01:06:33,133 --> 01:06:34,200
- [Rick] No, not yet.

1328
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:38,233
(Pete sighs)

1329
01:06:38,266 --> 01:06:41,100
You know, this is such great news.

1330
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,600
Tommy's gonna have a place to go home to.

1331
01:06:47,633 --> 01:06:48,433
- Yes he will.

1332
01:06:51,766 --> 01:06:54,500
- Wait, this guy that did it is still out there?

1333
01:06:54,533 --> 01:06:56,400
- Yes he is, Pete, but not for long.

1334
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,066
- I don't know where we're heading, you know?

1335
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,933
People's emotions are running wild

1336
01:07:03,966 --> 01:07:06,666
because of something somebody tells 'em on TV.

1337
01:07:12,266 --> 01:07:13,400
- Look, Pete.

1338
01:07:18,266 --> 01:07:19,366
I thought Matt did it.

1339
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:22,466
I mean, everything pointed to it.

1340
01:07:27,033 --> 01:07:28,133
- Thank god he didn't.

1341
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:33,400
Boy, that would've been too much to take.

1342
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,066
Listen, shorty.

1343
01:07:39,533 --> 01:07:42,966
You're always gonna be part of my family.

1344
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:48,800
(both patting)

1345
01:07:52,966 --> 01:07:55,466
(tense music)

1346
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,866
(phone ringing)

1347
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,333
- Hunter.

1348
01:08:06,366 --> 01:08:07,366
- [Jack] That's a very touching picture, Hunter.

1349
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,033
Who's the old guy, Vicki's dad?

1350
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,700
- Where are ya, Jack?

1351
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:12,600
You sound close.

1352
01:08:12,633 --> 01:08:14,033
- Oh, I'm very close.

1353
01:08:15,433 --> 01:08:16,566
Listen, I enjoyed our little chase this morning.

1354
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,733
You're in better shape than I thought.

1355
01:08:18,766 --> 01:08:20,300
- Why don't we get together real soon,

1356
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:22,866
I'll show you what kind of shape I'm really in.

1357
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,499
- Well, to tell you the truth, I'm really unhappy.

1358
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:26,800
See, I don't feel I'm getting the coverage I deserve.

1359
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:29,533
Matt Sherry's getting all my air time, that's your fault.

1360
01:08:29,566 --> 01:08:31,400
- Well, why don't you turn yourself in?

1361
01:08:31,433 --> 01:08:34,233
I guarantee you'll be all over the news.

1362
01:08:34,266 --> 01:08:36,033
- You know, I saw Matt Sherry drive away

1363
01:08:36,066 --> 01:08:37,999
from the house that night.

1364
01:08:38,033 --> 01:08:39,666
If I'd have gotten there 10 minutes earlier

1365
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,033
and heard their argument, I never woulda killed her.

1366
01:08:42,066 --> 01:08:44,466
Not if I knew people might think he did it.

1367
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:45,999
- I'm gonna kill you, Jack.

1368
01:08:48,366 --> 01:08:49,800
- Is that right?

1369
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:53,400
Oh, by the way, that reminds me, I've been a bad boy, sorry.

1370
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:56,300
But as you know, I have this desperate need for attention.

1371
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:57,566
- Now you listen to me.

1372
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,533
- No, you shut up!

1373
01:08:58,566 --> 01:08:59,566
You listen to me!

1374
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,833
There is a dead girl in an alley

1375
01:09:02,866 --> 01:09:05,233
behind the promenade because you closed my gym.

1376
01:09:06,533 --> 01:09:08,766
I want my 15 minutes of fame, dammit!

1377
01:09:11,233 --> 01:09:13,066
Now for every day you don't catch me,

1378
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,166
there'll be one more girl.

1379
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,700
I want you to think about that tonight

1380
01:09:16,733 --> 01:09:17,999
when you're alone in bed.

1381
01:09:19,633 --> 01:09:21,033
Do that for me, Hunter.

1382
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:25,533
(eerie music)

1383
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,700
(cameras clicking)

1384
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,766
(siren wailing)

1385
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,733
(dispatcher chattering on radio)

1386
01:10:07,066 --> 01:10:08,700
- Absolutely not, Lieutenant, I got a tide

1387
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:10,333
of public opinion against this man.

1388
01:10:10,366 --> 01:10:11,166
- Who happens to be innocent.

1389
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:12,733
- Maybe he's innocent.

1390
01:10:12,766 --> 01:10:14,933
So you want me to announce to the whole country

1391
01:10:14,966 --> 01:10:16,866
that Matt Sherry is no longer a suspect

1392
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,200
and some crackpot that's calling you

1393
01:10:18,233 --> 01:10:19,200
on the phone is the killer.

1394
01:10:19,233 --> 01:10:20,700
- Yeah. - No.

1395
01:10:20,733 --> 01:10:22,500
- Wait a minute, if we don't do something to stop this guy,

1396
01:10:22,533 --> 01:10:23,533
someone else is gonna get killed.

1397
01:10:23,566 --> 01:10:25,000
- And let me tell you something,

1398
01:10:25,033 --> 01:10:26,700
if you don't do it, I will, and I don't give a damn

1399
01:10:26,733 --> 01:10:27,933
about the repercussions.

1400
01:10:29,366 --> 01:10:31,633
- Charlie, if you are so sure that this guy did it,

1401
01:10:31,666 --> 01:10:32,566
bring him in.

1402
01:10:34,366 --> 01:10:35,200
Alive.

1403
01:10:38,466 --> 01:10:40,166
- [Charlie] Rick, he said alive.

1404
01:10:47,466 --> 01:10:48,866
- How you feeling, Sergeant?

1405
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,600
(solemn music)

1406
01:10:56,366 --> 01:10:57,533
- Who are you?

1407
01:10:58,933 --> 01:11:00,100
- You know me.

1408
01:11:01,533 --> 01:11:03,300
Remember we talked on the phone right before your accident?

1409
01:11:05,066 --> 01:11:06,100
(Harry moans)

1410
01:11:06,133 --> 01:11:06,933
Looking for this?

1411
01:11:14,766 --> 01:11:18,000
Just wanted to see if you're all right.

1412
01:11:22,466 --> 01:11:26,200
Why haven't you told the world the truth about Matt Sherry?

1413
01:11:26,233 --> 01:11:27,066
About me?

1414
01:11:29,866 --> 01:11:32,400
- We decided not to do you any favors.

1415
01:11:32,433 --> 01:11:33,933
- Wall to wall, every station,

1416
01:11:33,966 --> 01:11:36,466
all I see is that lousy basketball coach,

1417
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:37,666
that oughta be me.

1418
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:40,400
- He won a few more games than you did.

1419
01:11:41,566 --> 01:11:43,300
- I think I could push my numbers up.

1420
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:49,766
- I think that that would be a mistake on your part.

1421
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,633
- Do you?

1422
01:11:52,866 --> 01:11:57,333
Well, I guess that's up to your boss, isn't it?

1423
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,900
- Do you have any idea what Lieutenant Hunter's

1424
01:12:01,933 --> 01:12:03,800
gonna do to you?

1425
01:12:03,833 --> 01:12:06,033
- Yeah, he delivered that little news flash.

1426
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:10,566
Listen, I'm gonna leave you the address

1427
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,400
of a motel in West Hollywood.

1428
01:12:15,233 --> 01:12:17,300
Little something there for ya.

1429
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,333
Even Hunter can't screw this one up.

1430
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:27,733
(eerie music)

1431
01:12:27,766 --> 01:12:28,600
You rest.

1432
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,200
(solemn music)

1433
01:13:28,966 --> 01:13:31,466
(eerie music)

1434
01:14:05,966 --> 01:14:07,800
Evening, Lieutenant Hunter.

1435
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,500
I wanted to make this a face-to-face meeting,

1436
01:14:09,533 --> 01:14:13,200
but you get so stressed whenever we get together.

1437
01:14:13,233 --> 01:14:16,200
I really wanted to make this tape to officially confess.

1438
01:14:16,233 --> 01:14:20,066
See, I killed Rachel Kincaid outside the gym.

1439
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,566
Vicki Sherry was next on the list,

1440
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,033
but they put a security guard in front of the gym

1441
01:14:23,066 --> 01:14:26,200
and I just had to go to Malibu, so anyway.

1442
01:14:28,066 --> 01:14:31,133
This is the murder weapon.

1443
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,400
I'm sure even your lame forensics department

1444
01:14:34,433 --> 01:14:35,866
can confirm that.

1445
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,633
I'll leave it around here for you someplace,

1446
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:39,100
I don't know.

1447
01:14:39,133 --> 01:14:41,100
Maybe the wishing well, maybe not.

1448
01:14:42,366 --> 01:14:43,166
You'll find it.

1449
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,466
But I want you to listen very carefully.

1450
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,266
I want this tape broadcast on all the networks

1451
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,633
within 24 hours.

1452
01:14:49,666 --> 01:14:51,166
Matt Sherry looks so distressed.

1453
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:52,633
I want to relive him of the burden

1454
01:14:52,666 --> 01:14:55,066
of being falsely accused of a crime he didn't commit.

1455
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:55,933
My crime.

1456
01:14:57,233 --> 01:14:58,066
My crime.

1457
01:15:00,566 --> 01:15:02,500
Now, for every day this tape is delayed,

1458
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,200
what am I talking, you know the deal.

1459
01:15:07,233 --> 01:15:10,833
Listen, I gotta go, so I'll see you on Cops.

1460
01:15:12,433 --> 01:15:14,866
- We'll put that tape on the air.

1461
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,033
- Shut that off!

1462
01:15:16,066 --> 01:15:17,366
- Lieutenant Hunter, isn't it true

1463
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,766
you have another suspect in the Matt Sherry case?

1464
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:20,100
- I said shut it off.

1465
01:15:20,133 --> 01:15:21,233
- Keep rolling.

1466
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:22,400
- [Rick] Give me that.

1467
01:15:22,433 --> 01:15:23,400
- Oh. - Hey, be careful with that.

1468
01:15:23,433 --> 01:15:24,800
- How'd you two guys find me?

1469
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:26,400
- We got an anonymous call at the station,

1470
01:15:26,433 --> 01:15:28,500
guy said he was a friend of yours from Venice.

1471
01:15:28,533 --> 01:15:29,800
- Uh-huh.

1472
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:31,466
I'm confiscating this tape as evidence

1473
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,100
of an ongoing police investigation.

1474
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:34,033
- Well hey, you have no right.

1475
01:15:34,066 --> 01:15:35,233
- Shut up.

1476
01:15:35,266 --> 01:15:36,933
- Wait a minute, you are way outta line here.

1477
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:38,233
- Yeah, and you're gonna get somebody killed.

1478
01:15:38,266 --> 01:15:39,633
Give me your wrists.

1479
01:15:40,733 --> 01:15:41,500
- What do you think you're doing?

1480
01:15:41,533 --> 01:15:42,333
- You're under arrest.

1481
01:15:42,366 --> 01:15:43,466
- For what?

1482
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,033
- Obstruction of justice and interfering

1483
01:15:45,066 --> 01:15:48,000
with a police officer's investigation.

1484
01:15:48,033 --> 01:15:50,166
- Oh, you gotta be kidding!

1485
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,766
- Does it look like I'm kidding?

1486
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,500
Have a good night.

1487
01:15:53,533 --> 01:15:55,833
- You are in big trouble, Hunter!

1488
01:15:55,866 --> 01:15:58,233
(door closes)

1489
01:15:58,266 --> 01:16:00,766
(eerie music)

1490
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:15,200
- I know how to catch him.

1491
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,366
First of all, let me just say that I had

1492
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,733
very good reason for handcuffing you

1493
01:17:21,766 --> 01:17:22,966
to the bed post that night.

1494
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,800
I was in hot pursuit of a 187 suspect,

1495
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:30,066
and I did not want to jeopardize the life of a civilian.

1496
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:30,966
- Even me?

1497
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,566
- Even you.

1498
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,566
Albeit my behavior was a little--

1499
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:36,733
- Rash?

1500
01:17:36,766 --> 01:17:37,600
- Rash.

1501
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,000
Apology accepted?

1502
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:43,666
Great.

1503
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,333
Now I have a deal for you.

1504
01:17:45,366 --> 01:17:47,266
- And what's in it for us?

1505
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,233
- Exclusive footage of the capture

1506
01:17:49,266 --> 01:17:50,266
of the killer of Vicki Sherry.

1507
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,933
- And what do you want?

1508
01:17:56,966 --> 01:17:58,666
- A little help with some editing?

1509
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,866
(solemn music)

1510
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:08,966
- All right, Tracy, thank you.

1511
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,066
Repeating our top story from five o'clock,

1512
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,366
we have a late-breaking development in the

1513
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,366
Matt Sherry case.

1514
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,333
For all the details, let's go to Sally Vogel

1515
01:18:16,366 --> 01:18:17,966
at the pond in Anaheim.

1516
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,166
Sally.

1517
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,833
- The focus of the Matt Sherry investigation

1518
01:18:20,866 --> 01:18:23,633
has shifted to the pond in Anaheim tonight,

1519
01:18:23,666 --> 01:18:26,433
where Coach Sherry reports to work every day.

1520
01:18:26,466 --> 01:18:30,033
Investigators believe that the still-unfound murder weapon

1521
01:18:30,066 --> 01:18:33,333
may be located somewhere inside this massive building.

1522
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,300
In yet another bizarre twist--

1523
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:37,533
- No.

1524
01:18:37,566 --> 01:18:39,033
- Channel three has exclusive footage

1525
01:18:39,066 --> 01:18:41,266
from a man claiming to be the killer of Vicki Sherry.

1526
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,966
I'm standing here with Lieutenant Rick Hunter,

1527
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,666
who is, as you all know, the LAPD officer

1528
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,000
who was engaged to Vicki Sherry.

1529
01:18:49,033 --> 01:18:51,166
Lieutenant Hunter, I know you were opposed

1530
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,766
to us broadcasting this tape, but could you tell me

1531
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,300
what you make of this bizarre confession?

1532
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:59,033
- It's complete nonsense, and it's irresponsible

1533
01:18:59,066 --> 01:19:01,266
of you people to put this guy on the air.

1534
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,233
He's a sick, whacked out media freak.

1535
01:19:03,266 --> 01:19:05,000
We have hundreds of tapes like this.

1536
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:08,166
People confessing to everything from the Manson killings

1537
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,833
to the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby.

1538
01:19:09,866 --> 01:19:11,533
- We do?

1539
01:19:11,566 --> 01:19:13,366
- Are you having any luck in your search

1540
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,900
for the murder weapon?

1541
01:19:14,933 --> 01:19:16,933
- We're cautiously optimistic.

1542
01:19:16,966 --> 01:19:18,633
- And do you anticipate an arrest

1543
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:20,100
any time soon in this case?

1544
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,300
- Yes I do.

1545
01:19:23,333 --> 01:19:25,100
- [Sally] Okay, let's roll the tape.

1546
01:19:26,766 --> 01:19:28,233
- Here's the murder weapon.

1547
01:19:28,266 --> 01:19:30,766
I killed Rachel Kincaid, that's my crime.

1548
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,866
I want this tape broadcast on all the networks.

1549
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:34,433
Vicki Sherry was next on the list.

1550
01:19:34,466 --> 01:19:36,133
Matt Sherry looks so distressed.

1551
01:19:36,166 --> 01:19:37,100
My crime.

1552
01:19:37,133 --> 01:19:38,700
I'll see you on Cops.

1553
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:40,266
I'll see you on Cops.

1554
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:42,433
I'll see you on Cops.

1555
01:19:42,466 --> 01:19:43,866
No!

1556
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,833
- Well, there you have it, a strange case

1557
01:19:45,866 --> 01:19:47,933
gets even stranger.

1558
01:19:47,966 --> 01:19:49,400
And if there's any more of you out there

1559
01:19:49,433 --> 01:19:51,833
with taped confessions, do us a favor

1560
01:19:51,866 --> 01:19:53,366
and send them to channel six.

1561
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:54,333
Reporting live--

1562
01:19:54,366 --> 01:19:55,600
(Jack shouting)

1563
01:19:55,633 --> 01:19:57,900
I'm Sally Vogel for Action News 3.

1564
01:19:57,933 --> 01:19:59,066
Back to you...

1565
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:01,466
(electricity buzzing)

1566
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,100
(television set crashes)

1567
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:05,600
(tense music)

1568
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,966
- Been expecting you, Jack.

1569
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:53,966
- You made a fool outta me.

1570
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,133
- I made a fool outta you?

1571
01:20:56,166 --> 01:20:58,100
Did what you asked, put you on television.

1572
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,633
- Are we alone?

1573
01:21:04,733 --> 01:21:05,866
- It's just me and you.

1574
01:21:08,466 --> 01:21:10,566
- Well, why don't you come out and play, Hunter?

1575
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,000
(gun clicks)

1576
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:16,700
- Sealed off every exit, Jack.

1577
01:21:18,066 --> 01:21:20,266
No way out, just me and you.

1578
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:29,366
(gunshot bangs)

1579
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,400
(suspenseful music)

1580
01:21:35,166 --> 01:21:37,800
Jack, I'm gonna say this one time.

1581
01:21:37,833 --> 01:21:41,533
Drop your weapon and lay face down on the floor,

1582
01:21:41,566 --> 01:21:43,133
put your hands behind your back.

1583
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:47,200
(gunshot bangs)

1584
01:21:48,233 --> 01:21:49,633
I'm gonna take that as a no.

1585
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,533
(gunshots banging)

1586
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,433
(electricity buzzes)

1587
01:22:16,233 --> 01:22:18,733
(Rick grunts)

1588
01:22:32,866 --> 01:22:34,566
(Rick groans)

1589
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,100
- Very persistent, Hunter.

1590
01:22:42,366 --> 01:22:43,266
Hang on, Hunter.

1591
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,500
They got a home game on Tuesday.

1592
01:23:17,166 --> 01:23:18,000
- Valko.

1593
01:23:20,533 --> 01:23:21,833
I have confession to make.

1594
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,166
I lied.

1595
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,400
We're not alone.

1596
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,533
See 'em down near the lights?

1597
01:23:28,566 --> 01:23:30,833
The media, they're all for you.

1598
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:36,433
- Getting anything?

1599
01:23:42,333 --> 01:23:45,633
- This is your 15 seconds of fame, Jack.

1600
01:23:45,666 --> 01:23:48,966
- It's 15 minutes, you idiot.

1601
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,400
- No.

1602
01:23:50,433 --> 01:23:52,233
I think I got it right in your case.

1603
01:23:54,766 --> 01:23:57,033
You're gonna spend the rest of your life in jail, Jack.

1604
01:24:00,133 --> 01:24:03,000
(cameras clicking)

1605
01:24:06,266 --> 01:24:09,633
You know how hard it is for me not to kill you?

1606
01:24:09,666 --> 01:24:12,333
(Jack laughing)

1607
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,433
- I gotta go.

1608
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,333
(Jack shouting)

1609
01:24:21,366 --> 01:24:24,166
(cameras clicking)

1610
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,700
(Jack shouting)

1611
01:24:26,733 --> 01:24:31,733
(glass shattering) (people gasping)

1612
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,366
(cameras clicking) (people chattering)

1613
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,333
- I got the whole shot.

1614
01:24:43,766 --> 01:24:46,466
(cameras clicking)

1615
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:49,033
- We knew from the start that Matt Sherry was innocent,

1616
01:24:49,066 --> 01:24:50,500
and that's why we delayed in asking

1617
01:24:50,533 --> 01:24:51,900
the grand jury for an indictment.

1618
01:24:51,933 --> 01:24:54,766
Now what we had here was a media frenzy,

1619
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,566
without the benefit of the facts that we had in hand.

1620
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,200
Now, any questions, anybody?

1621
01:24:59,233 --> 01:25:00,266
- [Reporter] Sir, are you running for

1622
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,266
United States Senator?

1623
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:03,300
- Remind me to keep up with this guy, will you?

1624
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,400
- Yeah, right. (chuckles)

1625
01:25:07,433 --> 01:25:10,333
- No no no, I'm just glad this whole ordeal has ended

1626
01:25:10,366 --> 01:25:12,566
and I can turn my attention back to my son.

1627
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,100
And my team.

1628
01:25:15,133 --> 01:25:17,133
I'm very grateful to Lieutenant Rick Hunter

1629
01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:19,800
for encouraging me to seek counseling

1630
01:25:19,833 --> 01:25:23,533
regarding my inexcusable behavior towards women.

1631
01:25:23,566 --> 01:25:26,133
(solemn music)

1632
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,500
- Hey, how was the fishing, buddy?

1633
01:25:37,533 --> 01:25:38,433
- [Tommy] It was great.

1634
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:40,966
- Ah, that's good, that's good.

1635
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:42,800
- Matt.

1636
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:43,666
- Thanks.

1637
01:26:48,133 --> 01:26:50,566
- [Vicki] My darling Lieutenant Hunter.

1638
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,033
I know it's awfully formal of me

1639
01:26:52,066 --> 01:26:53,233
to write you a thank you note,

1640
01:26:53,266 --> 01:26:55,133
but it's something I was always nagged to do

1641
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:58,133
by my mother, may she rest in peace.

1642
01:26:58,166 --> 01:27:01,000
The ring is so beautiful, but not nearly

1643
01:27:01,033 --> 01:27:02,433
as beautiful as you.

1644
01:27:02,466 --> 01:27:05,400
It symbolizes the happiness you've brought to me,

1645
01:27:05,433 --> 01:27:07,100
and will always be a constant reminder

1646
01:27:07,133 --> 01:27:09,400
of the place you hold in my heart.

1647
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:13,266
Together we will have the family we've always talked about.

1648
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:16,200
Again I say yes to your proposal.

1649
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:18,800
My love forever, Vicki.

1650
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:23,100
(solemn music)

1651
01:27:44,433 --> 01:27:47,000
(solemn music)
