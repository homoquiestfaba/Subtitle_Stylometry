to concentrate.

00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,180
Dallas, okay.
Okay, sweetie. Okay, yes.

511
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,980
Dallas, come on!

Look at me! Dallas!

This door's not gonna
hold much longer.

00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,160
Okay, we need
to go up the stairs.

No, wait. I don't know.
I don't know.

I have it!

00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,820
Down two flights of stairs,
then--

518
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,490
then through the main hall,
and that should take us
to the entrance.

519
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,130

we head to the door.

real soon.

to live for.

You're on your way,

Don't you worry
your sweet little head
about that.

Our Lord in heaven,
He has a plan for us all,

527
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,130
and I know
He just misses you.

528

Please,
I just want to go home.

want from me?

to paradise, sugar.

to pick a route now.
