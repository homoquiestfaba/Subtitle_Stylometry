1
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:09,033
<i>Blow out your candles,
sweetie.</i>

2
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:17,276
Can I open presents now,
mommy?

3
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:19,345
Sweetie,
what do we say?

4
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:21,816
Please?

5
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:23,718
All right.

6
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,853
Actually,
Britney and Bella and I

7
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:29,559
sort of have a special gift
for Sophia, if that's okay?

8
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:31,360
It's fantastic.

9
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:34,466
I love surprises.

10
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:36,701
-Do you wanna go get it?
-Yeah, excuse me.

11
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:39,738
Sophia, honey, what do you say
to Bella and Britney

12
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,441
for getting you a surprise?

13
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:43,511
Thank you!

14
00:07:43,544 --> 00:07:46,247
You're welcome.

15
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,355
Mommy!

16
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:55,627
I'm sorry,
will you take her away?

17
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,864
She's terrified.

18
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:02,436
It's okay, it's okay, sweetie.
She's gone away.

19
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:04,304
I am so sorry.

20
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:07,408
No, it's fine.
She's just sensitive.

21
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:09,312
What do you think daddy?

22
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:12,149
Think it's time
for our gift now?

23
00:08:12,182 --> 00:08:15,753
Yeah, that's a good idea.
You hold Winston for a sec?

24
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,323
Yeah.

25
00:08:18,357 --> 00:08:20,627
Sophia, look what
I got for you.

26
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:22,664
Look at this.

27
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:28,404
It's so... big.

28
00:08:28,438 --> 00:08:29,507
Open it up.

29
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:35,781
A puppy!

30
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,656
-Okay!
-He's perfect.

31
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,758
He's so cute!

32
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,359
Is he all mine, daddy?

33
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,863
Yeah, he sure is.

34
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:48,797
Your mommy and I thought
that we should get Winston

35
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:50,934
a companion for his last
few years with us,

36
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:52,804
<i>you know,
make him feel young again.</i>

37
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:55,507
Well, I better not be the one
cleaning up after him.

38
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,242
<i>I'll help you.</i>

39
00:08:57,276 --> 00:08:59,713
You said that the last time.

40
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:02,649
Can Winston
meet the new puppy?

41
00:09:02,682 --> 00:09:04,285
Yeah, sure.

42
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:07,357
Hold on,
let me get my camera.

43
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,394
<i>Okay, honey, be careful.
-Hi, Winston!</i>

44
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:14,332
What have I got for you?

45
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:18,403
You got a friend.

46
00:09:18,437 --> 00:09:19,807
Aw.

47
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,950
See?
He likes him, daddy.

48
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,555
Aw.

49
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,404
Do it again!

50
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,746
<i>I got blood in my hair!</i>

51
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,650
<i>I got blood in my eyes!</i>

52
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,534
<i>-Do we have any...
-Woman: Flashlights?</i>

53
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:31,870
<i>I come prepared.</i>

54
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:36,041
Yeah.

55
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:40,547
There's plenty of space
up here for storage.

56
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,817
Moving boxes,
your hideous couch...

57
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,553
I know,
we'll make it your bedroom.

58
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:46,021
Ha-ha.

59
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,661
Looky here.

60
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,072
It's locked.

61
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:01,442
20 bucks says
it's full of old porn.

62
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:02,545
Let me see.

63
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:05,748
MacGyver taught me this.

64
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:06,950
Right.

65
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:20,634
-Creepy.
-Cool.

66
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,080
<i>Hello?</i>

67
00:11:30,113 --> 00:11:31,916
Brian?

68
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:34,085
<i>Hey where you guys do
wanna put these chairs?</i>

69
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:35,754
Why did we
ask him to help?

70
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:37,022
We didn't.
He volunteered.

71
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:39,159
Dude,
turn on the lights!

72
00:11:41,228 --> 00:11:42,697
God.

73
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,502
New house.

74
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:47,871
New roommate.

75
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:49,940
New adventures.

76
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,042
Cheers.

77
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:55,715
Thanks, Brian, for lifting
all the heavy stuff.

78
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:57,483
Of course.

79
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,086
Well,
back to unpacking.

80
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,925
Yay.

81
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:09,632
So...

82
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,203
What's the plan?

83
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:14,073
Well, my closet's smaller now.

84
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:16,209
Only problem with this house.

85
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:20,047
So I'm gonna pick out
some shoes to give away.

86
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:21,850
I'm only gonna cry a little.

87
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:24,019
No, I mean what's
the plan for tonight?

88
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:25,856
Are we doing anything?

89
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:27,823
Celebrating or anything?

90
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:32,097
No, I think we're
just gonna unpack, get settled.

91
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:34,701
Cool.

92
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,608
What the...

93
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:53,592
Raccoon.

94
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,761
You know, you should probably
get somebody on the...

95
00:12:55,794 --> 00:12:58,632
First night's adventure!
Hey, Kristen!

96
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,636
Um, actually...

97
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:04,072
I was gonna say you should call
an exterminator, but I mean...

98
00:13:04,105 --> 00:13:05,741
Kristen?

99
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:08,212
Well,
she'll miss all the fun.

100
00:13:13,819 --> 00:13:15,789
I can go up first.

101
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:17,825
I ain't afraid
of no raccoons.

102
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:22,899
Yeah, 'cause rabies
is all the rage nowadays.

103
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,718
God, Kristen.

104
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:39,920
You scared me.

105
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:44,026
Dude, the lights!

106
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,129
God.

107
00:13:56,777 --> 00:13:57,945
Guys?

108
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:02,384
Is this a joke?

109
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,728
Kristen?

110
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,054
Bertrand,
my good fellow.

111
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:32,324
Can I invite you round
for some tea?

112
00:14:32,357 --> 00:14:34,760
Perhaps a scone?

113
00:14:34,794 --> 00:14:37,296
No, I'm sorry,
old chap,

114
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,433
but I dined
not an hour hence.

115
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:42,204
I ate at that the new
cultist delicatessen

116
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:44,240
over on innsmouth terrace.

117
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:46,409
I've seen the place.

118
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:48,780
How fares the cuisine?

119
00:14:48,813 --> 00:14:50,182
Fine, fine.

120
00:14:50,214 --> 00:14:52,216
But the eggs
were a strange lot...

121
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,387
The size of my fist,
leathery,

122
00:14:55,421 --> 00:14:59,428
and constantly shifting in
iridescent color.

123
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:02,231
Well, that's like no egg
I've ever seen,

124
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:04,167
and I'm an egg-ologist.

125
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,336
They've left my stomach
in somewhat of a tizzy.

126
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:11,243
I don't feel too well at all.

127
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:19,020
No!

128
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,127
-No!
-Yes!

129
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,097
-No!
-Yes!

130
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:28,099
-No!
-Yes!

131
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:47,286
Hello?!

132
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:50,656
Help!

133
00:17:52,357 --> 00:17:55,362
Please!

134
00:20:19,355 --> 00:20:22,426
-Time?
-15 minutes 22 seconds.

135
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:24,361
Ladies and gentlemen,

136
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:28,367
the young Philly daystar
with a run of 15:22

137
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:30,570
has taken the lead in her heat.

138
00:20:30,602 --> 00:20:32,739
In second place overall.

139
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,909
<i>-15:22 did you say?
-Yes.</i>

140
00:20:34,941 --> 00:20:37,812
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
15 minutes 22 seconds</i>

141
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:41,385
is only 36 seconds
under the absolute best run

142
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,520
for a first-time competitor
in this event.

143
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:49,395
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you look to the competitor

144
00:20:49,427 --> 00:20:51,297
<i>in the right it looks
like spectacular bid</i>

145
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,666
<i>is making his move.</i>

146
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:54,369
<i>Let's hope he makes it
under the gun.</i>

147
00:20:54,401 --> 00:20:56,639
Wonderful job, my darling.

148
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:58,606
You did an excellent run
for a first timer

149
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,643
and especially
for your weight class.

150
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,847
You completed my...
Completely

151
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,316
and gave me a pretty bunny,
I don't mind telling you.

152
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:10,657
Go on, there you go.

153
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:12,927
There you go.

154
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,464
I just can't wait to see
what you do in round two.

155
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,416
<i>I don't have all day.</i>

156
00:21:29,449 --> 00:21:30,784
<i>I've got a lot
of other deliveries to get to,</i>

157
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:32,519
<i>and you're holding me up.</i>

158
00:21:32,553 --> 00:21:34,287
<i>Can you please just sign this
so I can leave?</i>

159
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:35,524
Here's a pen,
here's the page.

160
00:21:35,557 --> 00:21:36,892
Just sign it at the "x."

161
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,698
Hey, sorry, long day.

162
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:43,635
Can either of you sign this?
Anyone?

163
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,270
What's this?

164
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:47,939
Mom's stuff.
There's so much.

165
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,877
-Your mom's stuff?
-You kidding me?

166
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,880
Please just sign this.
Are you even listening to me?

167
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,748
Are you gonna leave
all the stuff here?

168
00:21:54,782 --> 00:21:57,820
It's a delivery.
I delivered it. Here it is.

169
00:21:57,852 --> 00:21:59,422
Okay, I got it.

170
00:22:04,663 --> 00:22:05,998
Let us help you.

171
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:12,639
Come on.
Let's get this sorted.

172
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,425
<i>Holger.</i>

173
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,369
Are you okay?

174
00:22:35,403 --> 00:22:37,507
Did you just say my name?

175
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,375
What?

176
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:41,945
It sounded like you just said
my name right next to me.

177
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,414
Sorry.

178
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:16,859
It's okay.
Thank you.

179
00:23:16,891 --> 00:23:20,963
Okay.
Let's keep moving.

180
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:33,482
Weird.

181
00:23:33,514 --> 00:23:36,385
<i>-It sounded like you were
right next to me. Laura.</i>

182
00:23:38,922 --> 00:23:41,525
Christy?

183
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:42,828
Did you just say my name?

184
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:54,742
<i>Laura, Laura come here.</i>

185
00:23:54,776 --> 00:23:57,480
<i>Laura, it's okay.</i>

186
00:23:57,512 --> 00:23:59,483
Okay, it's nothing.

187
00:24:06,992 --> 00:24:09,163
How rude.

188
00:24:09,196 --> 00:24:11,698
After everything today,

189
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:14,669
the ghost doesn't
even say my name.

190
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,971
That's what I
was about to say.

191
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:17,873
It wasn't just
that it said my name, it...

192
00:24:17,907 --> 00:24:20,178
-It sounded just like you.
-Exactly like you.

193
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,516
-And you wanted me to.
-I didn't say anything.

194
00:24:30,223 --> 00:24:33,462
The building lights
must be messed up again.

195
00:24:33,494 --> 00:24:35,497
I'm gonna go.

196
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:00,897
<i>Let's play.</i>

197
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:44,156
Hey guys, where's Ella?

198
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,730
<i>We should look for her.</i>

199
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:06,285
Is he serious?

200
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,128
This is insane.

201
00:26:14,161 --> 00:26:16,132
Look, we've already established
this whole thing is insane.

202
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:18,802
Quick, we only have four
and a half minutes to decide.

203
00:26:18,836 --> 00:26:20,270
Now, wait, the quicker
we gang up on each other,

204
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:21,873
the quicker
they can kill us...

205
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:23,942
If we don't choose,
any one of us could die.

206
00:26:23,974 --> 00:26:26,979
Do you wanna be responsible
for someone else's death?

207
00:26:27,012 --> 00:26:31,652
Amber's right.
We can't choose.

208
00:26:31,686 --> 00:26:33,923
Jesus, Ella,
where did you get that?

209
00:26:33,956 --> 00:26:36,126
I nominate Ivy
to be the one who dies.

210
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,629
Me?

211
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:40,931
I know who
you are now.

212
00:26:40,965 --> 00:26:43,068
I'm not following, El.

213
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,973
They never released
the name to my family

214
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:50,076
because the driver
was a minor.

215
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:54,149
She pled guilty.
Did her time, supposedly.

216
00:26:55,818 --> 00:26:58,222
Ivy was the drunk driver
who killed my sister.

217
00:27:01,091 --> 00:27:03,795
Is that true?

218
00:27:03,829 --> 00:27:07,067
It was a
really dark time, okay?

219
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,737
I'm not the same person
I was back then.

220
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:13,307
You still drink.

221
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:17,013
You still have fun.
And guess what?

222
00:27:17,046 --> 00:27:19,049
My sister doesn't get to!

223
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:20,452
El!

224
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:23,422
You think I don't live
with that every day?

225
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:26,292
I do!
I've changed.

226
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:30,231
<i>They tried to drive
us all crazy, one by one.</i>

227
00:27:30,264 --> 00:27:32,735
<i>Some of the girls
think we're a team.</i>

228
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:36,205
<i>Deep down, we know the truth.
We're all alone.</i>

229
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,976
Wait,
it's not what you think.

230
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:40,911
<i>Truth is...</i>

231
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:44,217
<i>I don't give a fuck
about any of them.</i>

232
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:47,721
<i>If being here
has taught me anything</i>

233
00:27:47,754 --> 00:27:50,024
<i>it's to look out
for number one.</i>

234
00:27:50,058 --> 00:27:51,893
<i>Screw everyone else.</i>

235
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:54,429
-Is that from the confession room?
-No, no!

236
00:27:54,463 --> 00:27:56,133
I don't even know
how they have that.

237
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:58,335
You heard it yourself,
girls.

238
00:27:58,368 --> 00:28:00,504
She'd stab anyone of us
in the back if she had the...

239
00:28:00,537 --> 00:28:04,209
Let's just turn it down and
let's just talk about it, okay?

240
00:28:04,243 --> 00:28:07,782
That recording was made
a long time ago.

241
00:28:07,815 --> 00:28:09,450
Please, you guys
have to believe me.

242
00:28:09,482 --> 00:28:12,287
Let's take a vote.
Majority rules.

243
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,791
-I vote we choose Ivy.
-Come on, Ella.

244
00:28:15,825 --> 00:28:17,895
Is that really what
your sister would want?

245
00:28:17,927 --> 00:28:19,830
Don't fucking talk
about my sister!

246
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,064
Stop it, you guys!

247
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:23,002
This is exactly
what they want us to do.

248
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,805
-We have to vote, Amber.
-No, we don't.

249
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,474
I wholeheartedly agree.

250
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:32,448
-Lila?
-I vote...

251
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,950
I choose Ivy.

252
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:36,920
<i>Always look out
for number one, right?</i>

253
00:28:36,952 --> 00:28:38,955
Just think
what you are doing.

254
00:28:38,988 --> 00:28:40,558
That's two for and two against.

255
00:28:40,592 --> 00:28:43,163
You're the tiebreaker, Shelly.
What's your vote?

256
00:28:43,195 --> 00:28:46,031
<i>Shelly!</i>

257
00:28:46,065 --> 00:28:48,903
She said herself
she'd take us all out.

258
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:52,809
<i>If it has to be one of us...</i>

259
00:28:52,841 --> 00:28:53,975
I choose Ivy.

260
00:28:56,379 --> 00:28:58,149
Get her on the ground.

261
00:28:58,181 --> 00:29:02,287
Ella? Ella. Please.
Please don't do this.

262
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:04,491
Ella.

263
00:29:05,892 --> 00:29:07,161
Please don't do this.

264
00:29:07,193 --> 00:29:10,064
You took my sister
away from me.

265
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:11,866
I'm so sorry.

266
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,304
This won't bring her back.

267
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:15,973
I loved her so much.

268
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,540
<i>Ella, look at me.</i>

269
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:19,009
How dare you.

270
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,111
Look at me.

271
00:29:22,648 --> 00:29:24,317
You don't want this.

272
00:29:41,172 --> 00:29:43,343
<i>Ivy, no!</i>

273
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,340
Do it.

274
00:30:09,077 --> 00:30:11,346
-I'll do it. I'll do it.
-Do it, you wussy.

275
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:13,515
-Freaking shut up. Shut up.
-So, it, piece of crap.

276
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:16,486
-Shut up. Shut up. Shut up, shut up.
-Do it. Do it.

277
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,190
You trust me?

278
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:20,659
-Do it, you wuss.
-You want me to?

279
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,995
-Yeah. Yeah, come on do it.
-Yeah?

280
00:30:23,027 --> 00:30:25,932
-I'm gonna put this right in your brain.
-Great, do it.

281
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:27,235
Trust?

282
00:31:29,284 --> 00:31:31,387
Uncle.

283
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,023
Seriously?

284
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:35,291
Yeah, you're aiming it
right at me.

285
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:37,161
This isn't even the closest
I've come all day.

286
00:31:37,193 --> 00:31:39,063
I know, you win.

287
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,264
What, you didn't trust me?

288
00:32:06,666 --> 00:32:08,669
<i>Hey, it's Brad.</i>

289
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:12,340
<i>I'm planning to come by
and get my stuff.</i>

290
00:32:12,374 --> 00:32:15,546
<i>You and I both know
this is for the best.</i>

291
00:32:15,579 --> 00:32:17,100
<i>Please don't be around
when I come by.</i>

292
00:32:48,724 --> 00:32:51,695
<i>Hey, it's Brad.</i>

293
00:32:51,728 --> 00:32:53,630
<i>I'm planning to come by
and get my stuff.</i>

294
00:32:53,662 --> 00:32:55,432
<i>You and I both know
this is for the best...</i>

295
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:57,803
<i>Hey, it's Brad.</i>

296
00:32:57,836 --> 00:33:00,440
<i>I'm planning to come by
and get my stuff.</i>

297
00:33:00,472 --> 00:33:01,741
<i>You and I both know
this is for the best...</i>

298
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,476
<i>Hey, it's Brad</i>

299
00:34:27,856 --> 00:34:29,425
I can't keep it.

300
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:35,914
Here's your stuff.

301
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,132
This was yours, too,
isn't it?

302
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:24,747
I'll put you away later.

303
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:08,471
What the hell?

304
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:10,539
Go on,
get out of here, go!

305
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:12,576
Go! Shoo!

306
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:23,190
Apple?

307
00:37:41,748 --> 00:37:44,218
Yes, yes,
I'll be right upstairs.

308
00:37:44,252 --> 00:37:47,223
<i>No, no, the last one I was
telling you about.</i>

309
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:51,262
Yeah, for sure.
Give me a call back later.

310
00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:53,098
<i>Tomato.</i>

311
00:37:57,236 --> 00:37:58,538
Cow.

312
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:14,726
You fucking kid!

313
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:23,138
Hey! What are you doing
out here?!

314
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:24,939
Fish.

315
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,750
People.

316
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:41,628
Fish.

317
00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:43,298
What the hell are you
doing in my house?!

318
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:54,211
People. Fish.

319
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:55,914
Could you just
not do that?

320
00:39:01,188 --> 00:39:02,791
That better be your parents.

321
00:39:05,292 --> 00:39:08,163
Hi, hi, hi, hi!
My name is grace.

322
00:39:08,197 --> 00:39:10,167
I'm your neighbor.
I have an eight-year old son.

323
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,771
<i>And Mr. Schultz said
that he saw him here with you?</i>

324
00:39:12,804 --> 00:39:15,240
<i>Yes, yes,
he's right upstairs...</i>

325
00:39:15,273 --> 00:39:17,042
People.

326
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:18,879
<i>He knows not to go up there!</i>

327
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:21,617
I've told him a thousand times
not to go up there!

328
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,323
So the next thing you know,
he's screaming bloody murder.

329
00:39:27,355 --> 00:39:30,293
I run to his room,
and he is completely gone.

330
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:32,696
No.

331
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,700
You can't possibly imagine.

332
00:39:34,733 --> 00:39:36,770
But he's safe.
Thank god.

333
00:39:36,803 --> 00:39:39,273
Bread. Fish.

334
00:39:39,306 --> 00:39:43,145
Okay, I have to ask.

335
00:39:43,178 --> 00:39:45,080
What is he doing,
and why is he doing that?

336
00:39:45,113 --> 00:39:46,882
Is it like tourette's?

337
00:39:46,915 --> 00:39:49,119
No, it's nothing like that.

338
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:51,422
<i>-Okay, good.
-It's his psychic ability.</i>

339
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:54,859
Um, what?

340
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,096
Although it's not
what one might expect.

341
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:59,098
Trevor's psychic ability

342
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:01,768
is merely to know
the last things somebody ate.

343
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:04,873
-Bread.
-Very good.

344
00:40:04,906 --> 00:40:06,342
Fish.

345
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:09,280
My god, he's right.
I had Sushi for lunch,

346
00:40:09,312 --> 00:40:13,085
-yes.
-It's an interesting ability.

347
00:40:13,118 --> 00:40:16,856
There's a really cute little
diner called shallow fork,

348
00:40:16,888 --> 00:40:19,158
they have really great pastries.
And it's really good coffee.

349
00:40:19,192 --> 00:40:21,646
I owe you a meal at the
least. It's the least I can do.

350
00:40:21,647 --> 00:40:22,464
Not at all.

351
00:40:22,497 --> 00:40:26,368
Thank you again
for everything.

352
00:40:26,401 --> 00:40:29,238
Bread. Fish. People.

353
00:40:29,271 --> 00:40:31,276
Come on.

354
00:40:37,549 --> 00:40:40,253
No, she is not as crazy
as he is.

355
00:40:40,286 --> 00:40:42,224
But get this...

356
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:45,360
Apparently he has
a psychic ability.

357
00:40:45,393 --> 00:40:49,532
No, I'm serious.

358
00:40:49,566 --> 00:40:53,004
God, no, no,
it's nothing cool.

359
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:55,106
His psychic ability
is to know

360
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:56,843
the last thing
that somebody ate.

361
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:58,377
It's the lamest thing ever.

362
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,858
No, no buddy.

363
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,493
Tonight's dinner
is for me and a guest.

364
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:41,068
Norman. Norman.

365
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:44,240
Hi, hi.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

366
00:41:44,272 --> 00:41:45,408
That's okay.

367
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,843
This is Norman.

368
00:41:46,876 --> 00:41:48,244
Hi, Norman.

369
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:49,519
He's a really,
really sweet boy.

370
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:51,282
I'm sure he is.

371
00:41:51,315 --> 00:41:53,018
Hi.
Come this way.

372
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,920
Okay.

373
00:41:54,952 --> 00:41:56,589
A little surprise.

374
00:41:56,622 --> 00:41:58,225
Here you go.

375
00:41:59,425 --> 00:42:00,862
How cute.

376
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,598
Yeah, thank you.

377
00:42:05,268 --> 00:42:08,171
I'm gonna go get our food.

378
00:42:08,204 --> 00:42:09,439
Okay.

379
00:42:11,643 --> 00:42:14,581
Norman, stay.
Good boy, good boy.

380
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:31,168
I did. I did.

381
00:42:31,201 --> 00:42:33,304
-You're a really good cook.
-Thank you.

382
00:42:33,337 --> 00:42:35,073
This is like...
It's impressive.

383
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:36,676
Well, you're the first
girl I've had over

384
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,247
to try my meat balls.

385
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,916
Did you actually
just say that?

386
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,219
I did, I did.

387
00:42:43,252 --> 00:42:45,421
So I have to work
tomorrow morning.

388
00:42:45,454 --> 00:42:46,891
Okay.

389
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,995
I brought
an overnight bag, though.

390
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,235
Cool.

391
00:42:59,572 --> 00:43:02,644
Sorry. Norman, Norman.

392
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:07,017
Norman, Norman,
come here, boy, come here.

393
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,221
Stay, stay, stay.

394
00:43:16,196 --> 00:43:17,999
<i>Don't go.</i>

395
00:43:18,032 --> 00:43:20,200
-I have to go at work.
-Okay.

396
00:43:56,784 --> 00:43:58,552
<i>Eva, you still here?</i>

397
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:04,593
<i>Eva, you still here?</i>

398
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:38,653
<i>This is Eva.</i>

399
00:45:38,686 --> 00:45:40,422
<i>-If I know you,
leave me a message.</i>

400
00:45:40,455 --> 00:45:43,393
<i>Hey, Eva, it's Jonah.</i>

401
00:45:43,425 --> 00:45:46,497
<i>I just wanted to say I had
a great time the other night...</i>

402
00:45:46,529 --> 00:45:47,899
<i>Again.</i>

403
00:45:47,932 --> 00:45:51,838
I... I hope to hear
from you again soon.

404
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:53,939
Bye.

405
00:45:53,972 --> 00:45:57,711
I know.
I know, boy, I know.

406
00:45:57,745 --> 00:45:59,915
<i>I'm not good enough
for another one.</i>

407
00:46:01,951 --> 00:46:04,521
<i>Gimme a kiss.
Gimme a kiss.</i>

408
00:46:21,744 --> 00:46:25,749
No, wait, no! No!

409
00:46:33,593 --> 00:46:35,728
<i>No.</i>

410
00:46:39,968 --> 00:46:43,773
<i>Please! Please, no!</i>

411
00:46:43,806 --> 00:46:46,477
<i>Help me! Help me!</i>

412
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,815
<i>Please!
Please, help me!</i>

413
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,818
This shit
is so predictable.

414
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,788
<i>Yeah.
Killer in a goofy mask</i>

415
00:46:54,821 --> 00:46:58,325
<i>stalks helpless teens,
kills them and gets killed.</i>

416
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:00,028
Or does he?

417
00:47:00,062 --> 00:47:02,364
It's not about the plot.
It's about the execution.

418
00:47:02,397 --> 00:47:05,569
<i>Or executions,
am I right?</i>

419
00:47:20,956 --> 00:47:24,628
Classic.

420
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,497
<i>You can take all of my clothes</i>

421
00:47:26,531 --> 00:47:28,366
<i>and leave me nothing
but a towel to dry with.</i>

422
00:47:28,399 --> 00:47:31,037
<i>I couldn't run away
without clothes.</i>

423
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:33,040
<i>I don't know.</i>

424
00:47:33,073 --> 00:47:35,943
<i>Well, then you could
watch me while I take the bath</i>

425
00:47:35,976 --> 00:47:37,979
<i>to make sure I don't
try anything.</i>

426
00:47:39,647 --> 00:47:41,817
<i>God damn it!</i>

427
00:47:51,597 --> 00:47:54,467
All right, I'm gonna
go drain the python.

428
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,070
I always thought of you
as having

429
00:47:56,104 --> 00:47:58,073
more of the garden variety.

430
00:48:22,905 --> 00:48:25,776
You know you're too good
for him, right?

431
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:32,886
Hey, hey, hey.

432
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:35,655
More importantly is he knows.

433
00:48:35,688 --> 00:48:39,060
I think he'd do, like,
anything for me.

434
00:48:39,093 --> 00:48:41,797
He'd give me his left arm
if I asked him to.

435
00:48:44,834 --> 00:48:49,441
-What the hell?
-Paul?

436
00:48:53,045 --> 00:48:54,448
Run!

437
00:48:58,587 --> 00:48:59,889
I'll take my own advice.

438
00:49:16,177 --> 00:49:18,580
God!

439
00:49:18,614 --> 00:49:19,749
Nancy.

440
00:49:25,723 --> 00:49:28,027
Nancy. Nancy.

441
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:14,555
P-please.

442
00:50:14,587 --> 00:50:15,724
Please.

443
00:50:15,756 --> 00:50:16,892
I'm coming for you, Paul.

444
00:50:16,925 --> 00:50:18,495
My god, please!

445
00:50:29,141 --> 00:50:32,813
You killed my fucking friends,
you asshole!

446
00:50:53,874 --> 00:50:55,944
You stay dead.

447
00:53:22,071 --> 00:53:23,407
Let me go.

448
00:53:56,384 --> 00:53:59,556
Brace yourself.
This can be cold.

449
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:02,293
You weren't kidding.

450
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:05,965
I have to say you look
a little bit further along

451
00:54:05,997 --> 00:54:08,334
in this stage of your pregnancy
than you should be.

452
00:54:08,368 --> 00:54:10,103
Could something be wrong?

453
00:54:10,136 --> 00:54:12,907
No, I don't think so.
But we're gonna take a look.

454
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,176
Is it just you today?

455
00:54:15,209 --> 00:54:18,047
Yes, Jeremy, he doesn't
wanna know the sex.

456
00:54:18,081 --> 00:54:20,451
-Well, you know, he could come and...
-it's fine.

457
00:54:26,626 --> 00:54:28,394
Looks like
we're getting some...

458
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:35,403
What is it?

459
00:54:35,437 --> 00:54:36,906
Doctor, what is it?

460
00:55:06,612 --> 00:55:08,315
<i>Hey, honey, how you doing?</i>

461
00:55:10,617 --> 00:55:12,987
Can you get
me some water?

462
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:14,089
Yeah, sure.

463
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:25,485
<i>Howard, I'm gonna show you
these photographs.</i>

464
00:56:25,517 --> 00:56:27,754
<i>I need you to tell me
what you know about them.</i>

465
00:56:35,196 --> 00:56:38,167
<i>Do you recognize
that little boy?</i>

466
00:56:38,201 --> 00:56:41,439
That's me.
Small me.

467
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,241
<i>And the next one.</i>

468
00:56:46,312 --> 00:56:50,518
<i>Where's Francis?
Francis dormyer is missing.</i>

469
00:56:50,551 --> 00:56:52,787
<i>Now when you escaped
from the house...</i>

470
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,557
I wasn't escaping.

471
00:56:55,591 --> 00:56:57,260
<i>What were you doing?</i>

472
00:56:57,293 --> 00:56:58,561
Groceries.

473
00:56:58,595 --> 00:57:01,132
Francis forgot
to feed me again.

474
00:57:01,165 --> 00:57:05,104
He's so busy saving people.
I wasn't escaping.

475
00:57:05,137 --> 00:57:06,773
<i>Okay.</i>

476
00:57:06,805 --> 00:57:09,176
<i>One of the neighbor said
she found you banging</i>

477
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:12,647
<i>on the barricaded front door,
screaming, "help me.</i>

478
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,651
<i>Help me, I'm trapped.
I'm not a little girl"</i>

479
00:57:16,652 --> 00:57:19,323
yeah, that's one
of Francis' favorite games.

480
00:57:19,356 --> 00:57:23,496
He dresses me like a little girl
and makes me drink his tea.

481
00:57:23,528 --> 00:57:25,398
I hate it.

482
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:30,405
But he says that the angel
says that I need salvation.

483
00:57:30,438 --> 00:57:32,308
<i>I was right.</i>

484
00:57:32,341 --> 00:57:34,109
<i>Howard, you're safe now.</i>

485
00:57:34,142 --> 00:57:36,612
I was safe before.
Francis takes care of me.

486
00:57:36,646 --> 00:57:38,415
He wants to save me.

487
00:57:38,448 --> 00:57:40,550
You, you and all your people,
you look at him,

488
00:57:40,584 --> 00:57:42,420
what he did,
and you think he's evil.

489
00:57:42,454 --> 00:57:45,692
But he's not.

490
00:57:45,725 --> 00:57:50,632
I once felt like you
that murder is wrong.

491
00:57:50,664 --> 00:57:52,333
I've learned so much.

492
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:57,840
You... you know what?

493
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:59,744
You only see things
in one dimension.

494
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,614
Wrong, right, good, evil,
savior, sinner.

495
00:58:02,648 --> 00:58:07,220
I'm sick of it!
What is wrong?

496
00:58:07,252 --> 00:58:08,688
What is evil...

497
00:58:17,267 --> 00:58:21,240
Why is it up to us
to judge good and evil?

498
00:58:22,608 --> 00:58:25,712
We're all of evil origins.

499
00:58:25,745 --> 00:58:28,916
But there is salvation!

500
00:58:28,949 --> 00:58:32,587
If you wanted to understand,
you would, but you won't.

501
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:36,893
But he knows.
He knows who's righteous.

502
00:58:36,925 --> 00:58:39,963
And he'll come for them
and he will save...

503
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,604
It's my time!

504
00:58:45,637 --> 00:58:48,175
It's finally my turn.

505
00:59:00,491 --> 00:59:01,760
<i>Turn it off.</i>

506
00:59:13,308 --> 00:59:14,810
<i>Are you happy?</i>

507
00:59:14,844 --> 00:59:17,548
-Yes.
-Good.

508
00:59:17,581 --> 00:59:19,850
Rose, there's something
I have to ask.

509
00:59:19,884 --> 00:59:22,655
Really?
What's that?

510
00:59:22,688 --> 00:59:24,289
Rose...

511
00:59:24,322 --> 00:59:25,491
Will you make me...

512
00:59:25,524 --> 00:59:26,993
Make me
the happiest man alive

513
00:59:27,026 --> 00:59:28,862
accept this proposal
and be my wife?

514
00:59:28,896 --> 00:59:31,900
Sorry, I should have
let you do that.

515
00:59:31,932 --> 00:59:35,371
-Maybe you've had enough champagne.
-No...

516
00:59:35,404 --> 00:59:37,941
I'm sorry.
So sorry.

517
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:39,578
That's okay.

518
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,446
Here.

519
00:59:44,783 --> 00:59:46,620
-Do you love me?
-Yes.

520
00:59:46,652 --> 00:59:47,888
-Say it.
-I love you.

521
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:08,817
Doctor?

522
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:17,896
<i>Hello?</i>

523
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:22,701
Hello?

524
01:00:24,738 --> 01:00:25,973
Doctor?

525
01:00:54,577 --> 01:00:55,746
<i>Rose.</i>

526
01:00:57,814 --> 01:01:00,018
Rose!

527
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:02,888
Well?
What do you say?

528
01:01:02,921 --> 01:01:03,990
What?

529
01:01:06,125 --> 01:01:08,129
James finds himself
in a room

530
01:01:08,162 --> 01:01:09,997
submerged in
three feet of water.

531
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:11,566
The water is rising.

532
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,669
Three items are
about to be destroyed...

533
01:01:13,702 --> 01:01:15,872
His pistol,
a picture of his family,

534
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,441
and a deck of cards.

535
01:01:17,475 --> 01:01:19,444
-Which one does he choose?
-His pistol.

536
01:01:19,477 --> 01:01:21,146
Darling.

537
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:24,550
You don't know
how happy you've made me.

538
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,889
Me, too.

539
01:01:27,922 --> 01:01:29,591
I'm sorry.
I don't feel good.

540
01:01:29,624 --> 01:01:31,762
I just...
I think I need... just...

541
01:01:36,834 --> 01:01:38,870
I can't wait to tell
my parents and your parents.

542
01:01:38,902 --> 01:01:40,840
We should call them.
Who should we call first?

543
01:01:40,872 --> 01:01:44,578
Um, I'm... mine.

544
01:01:44,611 --> 01:01:45,813
How are you feeling?

545
01:01:45,846 --> 01:01:47,682
Very strange.

546
01:01:47,715 --> 01:01:49,718
I can't... did i...
Did i...

547
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:51,053
Focus!

548
01:01:51,086 --> 01:01:53,722
This is so exciting!

549
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:54,991
Mom?

550
01:01:57,127 --> 01:02:00,166
Yeah.
I really miss you.

551
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,476
Please tell dad I'm sorry.

552
01:02:07,508 --> 01:02:09,445
I will love you always.

553
01:02:12,949 --> 01:02:14,251
-Ouch.
-Come here.

554
01:02:20,992 --> 01:02:22,895
I love you.

555
01:02:22,928 --> 01:02:26,199
Ever since I saw you
in that little blue dress.

556
01:02:26,233 --> 01:02:29,271
That's the one.

557
01:02:29,303 --> 01:02:30,739
Pay attention.

558
01:02:30,772 --> 01:02:34,577
One, two, three,
one, two, three.

559
01:02:34,611 --> 01:02:36,146
-Do it.
-No.

560
01:02:36,178 --> 01:02:37,982
-One, two, three.
-Please stop.

561
01:02:38,016 --> 01:02:40,785
The father enters his house.
The children are playing a game.

562
01:02:40,818 --> 01:02:42,255
-No!
-What game are they playing?

563
01:02:42,287 --> 01:02:43,689
-Stop!
-Wrong.

564
01:02:43,723 --> 01:02:45,827
Three tools hang
in a doorway.

565
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,695
-A hammer, a saw...
-Stop!

566
01:04:09,171 --> 01:04:11,041
Hi, Mary?

567
01:04:11,074 --> 01:04:12,876
Thinner!

568
01:04:12,909 --> 01:04:14,245
Yes, I'll hold.

569
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,411
Sour!

570
01:04:39,445 --> 01:04:40,714
Bitter!

571
01:04:42,381 --> 01:04:43,684
Filler!

572
01:04:47,055 --> 01:04:49,125
Boner.

573
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:57,402
The Millers!

574
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,072
You wouldn't.

575
01:05:01,942 --> 01:05:04,746
Liver!

576
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,350
Jiggler!

577
01:05:14,290 --> 01:05:15,859
Hitler!

578
01:05:19,532 --> 01:05:22,802
Uninformed voter!

579
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:25,396
The thing you have to understand
is that China attacked us first.

580
01:05:32,115 --> 01:05:33,985
Thriller!

581
01:05:36,187 --> 01:05:38,224
What in the name
of Dumbledore...

582
01:05:38,257 --> 01:05:40,060
Mother!

583
01:05:40,093 --> 01:05:41,828
God!

584
01:05:41,861 --> 01:05:44,398
Swiffer!

585
01:05:44,431 --> 01:05:45,801
Grindr!

586
01:05:45,834 --> 01:05:48,370
Hey.

587
01:05:52,809 --> 01:05:54,946
Potter!

588
01:05:54,978 --> 01:05:56,147
Gipper!

589
01:05:59,485 --> 01:06:01,821
Wicker... man.

590
01:06:15,373 --> 01:06:17,041
Okay, fine.

591
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:19,178
I shouldn't have eaten
your macaroni salad.

592
01:06:19,211 --> 01:06:20,512
I'm sorry.

593
01:06:20,546 --> 01:06:23,217
And I shouldn't have
overreacted.

594
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,453
Here, let me
make it up to you.

595
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:28,323
Centaur!

596
01:06:38,302 --> 01:06:39,906
Hello, ladies.

597
01:06:42,909 --> 01:06:44,344
Thinner.

598
01:07:18,524 --> 01:07:21,362
Three, two, one.

599
01:07:23,062 --> 01:07:24,365
You should tuck her
back in this time.

600
01:07:24,398 --> 01:07:26,668
I really don't think
she wants me to.

601
01:07:26,701 --> 01:07:28,169
You haven't tried.

602
01:07:28,203 --> 01:07:29,539
She's been acting
super weird

603
01:07:29,572 --> 01:07:31,441
since we get back
from the honeymoon.

604
01:07:31,474 --> 01:07:32,977
Don't call her weird.

605
01:07:33,009 --> 01:07:34,278
I didn't call her...

606
01:07:34,312 --> 01:07:36,315
Sorry.

607
01:07:38,216 --> 01:07:40,386
Hey.
What's up, pumpkin?

608
01:07:43,123 --> 01:07:45,961
The monster's in my closet.

609
01:07:45,994 --> 01:07:48,565
Sweetie, you're okay,
it's just a bad dream.

610
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,971
Galen will check it out
for you, okay?

611
01:07:54,004 --> 01:07:56,274
I don't want galen.

612
01:07:56,307 --> 01:07:58,277
I want you.

613
01:07:58,309 --> 01:08:00,446
Well, we'll go together.

614
01:08:16,369 --> 01:08:18,271
We're gonna check out your
room and you're gonna see

615
01:08:18,304 --> 01:08:20,507
it's free of
the boogeyman, okay?

616
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:23,110
But he's not
the boogeyman.

617
01:08:23,144 --> 01:08:28,017
<i>He told me his name
was Mr. Hendrix.</i>

618
01:08:28,049 --> 01:08:29,452
What did you say?

619
01:08:29,486 --> 01:08:31,522
He's not the boogeyman,
he's...

620
01:08:31,554 --> 01:08:33,390
It's Mr. Hendrix!

621
01:08:33,424 --> 01:08:35,360
Come here, galen.

622
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,336
See?

623
01:08:46,074 --> 01:08:47,643
See?

624
01:08:47,675 --> 01:08:49,545
But he only comes out
in the dark.

625
01:08:49,578 --> 01:08:51,081
Then we can leave
the lights on.

626
01:08:51,114 --> 01:08:53,418
He told me he wants
my soul.

627
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:57,188
Did you fill his head
with this crap?

628
01:08:57,222 --> 01:09:00,560
Galen, you have school,
and I have work.

629
01:09:00,593 --> 01:09:02,329
-But...
-No buts!

630
01:09:02,363 --> 01:09:06,703
You leave this room again,
I'm gonna SWAT your bottom.

631
01:09:06,736 --> 01:09:11,308
You could have the lights on,
but you've got to stay in bed.

632
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:12,710
You understand?

633
01:09:17,783 --> 01:09:19,520
<i>Baby's afraid of the dark?</i>

634
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:33,237
You okay?

635
01:09:33,271 --> 01:09:35,674
I thought maybe I...

636
01:09:35,706 --> 01:09:39,513
Would stay up
with Jordan for a bit.

637
01:09:39,546 --> 01:09:43,285
Are you okay with that?

638
01:09:43,318 --> 01:09:44,386
Yeah?

639
01:09:48,224 --> 01:09:50,561
All right,
I'll leave you two to it.

640
01:09:58,637 --> 01:10:00,541
He comes out of the closet,
doesn't he?

641
01:10:03,445 --> 01:10:05,782
You believe me?

642
01:10:05,814 --> 01:10:07,483
Nobody believed
me either.

643
01:10:08,918 --> 01:10:11,789
Who did you tell?

644
01:10:11,823 --> 01:10:13,758
My dad.

645
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:18,364
My mom died before I was
really old enough to remember.

646
01:10:18,398 --> 01:10:20,835
I don't remember my dad.

647
01:10:20,868 --> 01:10:23,238
Yeah, well, mine didn't exactly
stick around long enough

648
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:24,339
to leave me any memories.

649
01:10:26,642 --> 01:10:31,414
Did Mr. Hendrix
say anything to you?

650
01:10:31,447 --> 01:10:34,652
He told me he was gonna
take my soul.

651
01:10:34,685 --> 01:10:37,157
He told me that.

652
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:39,426
I am not gonna
let him hurt you.

653
01:10:39,459 --> 01:10:42,664
Do you understand me?
Besides I think you're okay.

654
01:10:42,696 --> 01:10:45,934
It's not really you he wants.
I think it's me.

655
01:10:45,968 --> 01:10:49,172
I know.
He told me that, too.

656
01:10:49,206 --> 01:10:52,677
<i>Bye, galen.</i>

657
01:12:29,106 --> 01:12:30,375
Hello?

658
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:44,827
Hello?

659
01:13:27,885 --> 01:13:30,621
I see you met Hank.

660
01:13:30,655 --> 01:13:34,060
That's what I call him.
A little less creepy that way.

661
01:13:34,093 --> 01:13:35,596
Yeah.

662
01:13:35,629 --> 01:13:37,163
I'm so sorry about that.

663
01:13:37,197 --> 01:13:39,501
We were in the studio
we couldn't hear a thing.

664
01:13:39,533 --> 01:13:41,836
I'm Karen.
I'm Oscar's camera assistant.

665
01:13:41,869 --> 01:13:44,807
Allie, it's literally okay.
I just got here.

666
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,709
Plus I had Hank
to keep me company.

667
01:13:46,742 --> 01:13:48,412
Yeah, well...

668
01:13:48,446 --> 01:13:52,818
He's collected a lot of
weird stuff over the years.

669
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:55,555
Let me get your bag.
The studio's out back.

670
01:13:55,587 --> 01:13:56,723
Okay. Thanks.

671
01:13:58,758 --> 01:14:01,729
<i>Allie, this is Henry.
Don't mind Henry.</i>

672
01:14:01,763 --> 01:14:04,567
I'm Henry.
Don't mind me.

673
01:14:04,599 --> 01:14:08,038
<i>-Allie.
-Mr. conley.</i>

674
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:11,142
Can I just say what...
It is such an honor

675
01:14:11,175 --> 01:14:15,482
-to be working with you...
-No, the honor is mine.

676
01:14:15,514 --> 01:14:17,717
It was those eyes, you have
a wonderful naturalism.

677
01:14:19,252 --> 01:14:20,955
I was thinking you
and I can do some really,

678
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:22,926
really cool together
for this campaign.

679
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:24,227
How's that sound?

680
01:14:24,259 --> 01:14:25,963
That sounds amazing.

681
01:14:25,996 --> 01:14:27,832
That sounds amazing.

682
01:14:27,865 --> 01:14:29,835
Yes, it does.

683
01:14:29,867 --> 01:14:33,038
Well, why don't you head over
to hair and makeup,

684
01:14:33,072 --> 01:14:34,708
and I will see you soon?

685
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:36,476
Okay.

686
01:14:36,509 --> 01:14:37,711
Karen?

687
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,084
<i>Right this way.</i>

688
01:15:06,616 --> 01:15:08,253
As I said...

689
01:15:08,286 --> 01:15:10,055
The honor's mine.

690
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:15,160
Shall we?

691
01:15:15,194 --> 01:15:16,965
I'm a little nervous.

692
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,702
You know, the native people
used to believe

693
01:15:20,735 --> 01:15:23,805
the camera steals the soul,
but I think the only thing you

694
01:15:23,839 --> 01:15:27,211
have to worry about is keeping
those spaghetti straps on.

695
01:15:27,243 --> 01:15:29,814
Um, do you want me
to just...

696
01:15:29,847 --> 01:15:31,217
No, no, no,
I don't want anything from you.

697
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:34,588
I mean, rather...
I do but...

698
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,564
It's nothing you should have
on your mind.

699
01:15:41,596 --> 01:15:43,766
Just...

700
01:15:43,799 --> 01:15:45,903
Just be you.

701
01:15:47,638 --> 01:15:48,908
I can do that.

702
01:15:55,348 --> 01:15:56,784
<i>That's nice.</i>

703
01:16:20,715 --> 01:16:22,218
<i>I think we got it.</i>

704
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:23,886
<i>Really?
Are you happy?</i>

705
01:16:23,918 --> 01:16:25,688
Are you?

706
01:16:25,722 --> 01:16:29,693
My soul
feels enriched.

707
01:16:29,727 --> 01:16:32,030
Good, good.

708
01:16:32,064 --> 01:16:33,767
Well, if you want
to get cleaned up,

709
01:16:33,799 --> 01:16:35,202
Karen can
help you with that.

710
01:16:35,235 --> 01:16:38,907
Just, just come back and
say goodbye before you go.

711
01:16:38,939 --> 01:16:40,910
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

712
01:16:43,145 --> 01:16:45,082
I'll see you in a few.

713
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:50,822
Allie, um... do...

714
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:55,129
Do you mind if i...

715
01:16:55,162 --> 01:16:57,065
Do you mind if I snap
one more picture...

716
01:16:57,097 --> 01:17:00,703
<i>For my private collection?</i>

717
01:17:00,735 --> 01:17:02,171
Of course.

718
01:17:02,204 --> 01:17:06,344
Um, same spot?
Do you want me to do anything?

719
01:17:06,376 --> 01:17:08,781
No, don't...

720
01:17:08,814 --> 01:17:12,185
Don't change anything,
yeah, yeah.

721
01:17:12,217 --> 01:17:13,854
Same spot's good.

722
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,924
Wow.

723
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:43,960
That's an incredible
looking camera.

724
01:17:43,994 --> 01:17:46,397
I've never seen one like it.
Where did you find that?

725
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:52,104
A,
Friend gave it to me.

726
01:17:52,137 --> 01:17:55,176
<i>It takes a very special
kind of picture.</i>

727
01:17:57,844 --> 01:17:59,365
They don't make them
like this anymore.

728
01:18:02,051 --> 01:18:05,890
Now just...

729
01:18:05,922 --> 01:18:06,990
Be you.
