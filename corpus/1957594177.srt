1
00:00:01,824 --> 00:00:04,657
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:28,342 --> 00:00:29,175
- Fucking.

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,817
That's what you were doing, right, Ralph?

4
00:00:35,677 --> 00:00:38,844
It's something about being aggressive.

5
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:44,634
Knowing you're the one
looking down at someone.

6
00:00:44,634 --> 00:00:48,801
Pinned underneath you,
responding to your every thrust.

7
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:51,470
It's comforting.

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,064
It's not just a male thing you know,

9
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:58,814
to want to be on top,

10
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:03,016
to protect what's yours.

11
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,590
Well, I learned that
much watching my mother

12
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,923
deal with my father while she was alive.

13
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:16,976
A woman knows.

14
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:23,405
Are you dressed yet?

15
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:25,334
Cause you've got to get out of here.

16
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:26,784
My father has business
tomorrow, and I've got

17
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,610
to make sure he's ready,
and I don't want him

18
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,027
seeing you leave.

19
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:41,906
Yep.

20
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:45,494
I learned a lot about
making sure you're the one

21
00:01:45,494 --> 00:01:47,608
doing the fucking,

22
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,025
and not the one being fucked.

23
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:52,723
(clank)

24
00:01:52,723 --> 00:01:54,142
(boom)

25
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:56,559
(dark music)

26
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,302
- Uh, the Puerto Rican kid.

27
00:02:13,302 --> 00:02:14,204
Him, I could deal with.

28
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:15,954
Him, you could trust.

29
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:18,049
But the Columbian kid,

30
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:19,645
what, what, what was his name?

31
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:20,722
- Garcia.

32
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:23,091
- Yeah, he's a snake.

33
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:24,923
He's not to be trusted.

34
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:26,110
Are you listening to me?

35
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,783
- I am, Boss, but we've
been over this already

36
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:29,450
yesterday with Toni.

37
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:32,774
- We did.

38
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:37,174
- I can handle the Spaniards, trust me.

39
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:39,421
Remember my cousin, Tommy Marone?

40
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:40,535
- The garbage cop?

41
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,034
- Right, you met him at the wedding.

42
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:45,690
Yeah, anyway, he's a boss
and in sanitation now, right?

43
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,467
I got it, the state is
using DEC and DEP to make

44
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,467
a major sweep down here.

45
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:56,059
- How come our friends
down at PD haven't called?

46
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:58,045
- Cause it's the Attorney
General's office, they won't

47
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:00,197
leak it to the PD until the last minute.

48
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:01,923
- Yeah, they're just
fucking with us with nickel

49
00:03:01,923 --> 00:03:03,167
and dime bullshit.

50
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:06,142
- 150 thousand dollars in
fines is not small potatoes,

51
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:07,559
not to me anyway.

52
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,008
Can I take this?

53
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:14,425
- Yeah, go ahead.

54
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:16,972
- Yeah?

55
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:20,677
Sure.

56
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:21,510
Hey, Fin.

57
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:24,717
Fin answer me this.

58
00:03:24,717 --> 00:03:26,967
Why the fuck do I need you?

59
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:32,301
You can't do a simple
fucking thing I ask you?

60
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:33,884
You fucking retard!

61
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:36,924
Know where I am?

62
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:38,536
That's right, don't fucking apologize,

63
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:40,203
just handle it, now!

64
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:43,705
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:48,235
(suspenseful music)

66
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:53,937
- Can't do that,

67
00:03:53,937 --> 00:03:56,310
I can't make heads or
tails out of this shit.

68
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,802
- Let the Jew handle it,
that's what you pay him for.

69
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:01,136
- Yeah, I know, I just, uh.

70
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:03,407
You, do you know who died?

71
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:05,921
That, uh, Bill Furente up in, a.

72
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,433
- Yeah, Sing-Sing, he had the cancer.

73
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:08,850
- Last week Anthony.

74
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,911
We went to the funeral.

75
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,078
You, me, Toni.

76
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,563
Remember?

77
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:14,730
- In Westbury?

78
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,443
(Anthony laughs)

79
00:04:17,443 --> 00:04:19,311
- Yeah, right, right.

80
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:20,394
Heart attack.

81
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:24,880
I want you to move what you can move, and,

82
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,746
uh collect what's owed.

83
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:29,886
- Why don't you call
Joey Apples and Pasqual?

84
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:33,197
- No, no, no, no, now,
you keep this among us.

85
00:04:33,197 --> 00:04:36,678
If the other family see a
drop of blood in the water,

86
00:04:36,678 --> 00:04:37,806
they're coming for the kill.

87
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:39,688
- You don't trust the capos?

88
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:40,605
- I do not.

89
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,663
Not now.

90
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:45,503
This is very important business, huh?

91
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:46,478
Capiche?

92
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:47,981
- Capiche.

93
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:49,116
- Capiche?

94
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:50,130
- Oh, the gang's all here.

95
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,301
- Whoah.
- Jesus Christ.

96
00:04:51,301 --> 00:04:52,801
- What's up, babe?
- Hey, another one, okay?

97
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:53,634
- How you doing?

98
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:55,630
How you doing?
- Hey, Jim.

99
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,463
You look great.

100
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,611
I'm trying to lose a
couple of pounds myself,

101
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:00,224
I'm doing that Weight
Watcher's like Gaetano.

102
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:02,093
- It ain't fucking working.

103
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:05,111
Anthony, sorry to come
unannounced, but, uh,

104
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:07,396
I was in the neighborhood.
- It's fine, it's fine, Jimmy.

105
00:05:07,396 --> 00:05:08,575
Anytime.

106
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:09,915
- Look at this guy, huh?

107
00:05:09,915 --> 00:05:11,155
You're getting back in the ring?

108
00:05:11,155 --> 00:05:12,446
- Nah, I don't know
about that, I ain't got

109
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,805
no wind anymore.

110
00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:15,036
Mickey the Mick.

111
00:05:15,036 --> 00:05:17,092
I ain't seen you around.

112
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:18,762
- That's cause I don't
hang out in subway johns

113
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:20,291
trolling for fags.

114
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,525
(laughter)

115
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:23,159
And it's not Mick.

116
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,159
It's Mickey.

117
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:26,845
Or Mr. O'mara to you.

118
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:29,775
- Easy, I'm just kidding.

119
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:31,912
How's Toni?

120
00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:34,530
- Toni's uh, busy with this and that.

121
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,117
- I just want to sell them.

122
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:38,561
- What can we do for
you today, uh, Jimmy C.?

123
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,603
- Well, Anthony, people talk to Gaetano,

124
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:42,808
he's been hearing some things.

125
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:46,945
Things that just don't sit right with us.

126
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:48,314
- What things?
- Gaetano got some

127
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,064
unsettling news.
- Hm.

128
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:55,078
- It seems your capos, Pasqual and Apples?

129
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:57,251
They're doing you dirty.

130
00:05:57,251 --> 00:05:59,508
They're skimming your profits, and uh,

131
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:01,314
we know for a fact that they took down,

132
00:06:01,314 --> 00:06:03,798
three trucks out of Kennedy last month.

133
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:05,594
- Are you certain about this?

134
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:07,126
- I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

135
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:09,820
- Come on, right under our noses?

136
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,987
- Well, I, uh,

137
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:15,067
I appreciate this information.

138
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,933
- Well, Gaetano would
expect the same courtesy

139
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,580
if the shoe was on the other foot.

140
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,413
- Ah, yes,

141
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:21,670
of course, of course.

142
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,121
- Alright, he also said
he'd like to see you

143
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:24,188
as soon as possible.

144
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:27,448
- Hey, I'll clear my schedule, and,

145
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:30,115
I just need to digest this news,

146
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,980
ah, a few days.

147
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,975
Thank you, Jimmy.
- Alright Anthony.

148
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:36,925
- Hey, come here.

149
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:39,113
(click)
(shot)

150
00:06:39,113 --> 00:06:39,946
- Ah!

151
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:41,547
(shot)

152
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:42,702
(shot)

153
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:44,041
(shot)

154
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:45,958
(shot)

155
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:49,455
(multiple shots)

156
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:51,857
(rapid shots)

157
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:54,607
(dramatic music)

158
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,854
- That fucker.

159
00:07:02,854 --> 00:07:04,771
(shot)

160
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:23,349
(somber music)

161
00:07:36,895 --> 00:07:39,363
(shutter clicking)

162
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:40,872
(click)

163
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:42,872
(click)

164
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,110
(clicking)

165
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:13,288
- Carmine, just in time for coffee.

166
00:08:13,288 --> 00:08:14,121
- [Carmine] What, no cake?

167
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:15,523
Just coffee?

168
00:08:15,523 --> 00:08:17,749
- Why don't somebody get
this guy an expresso?

169
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:18,582
Yeah, so what are you doing here?

170
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,245
What is this, high school reunion time?

171
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:23,288
- What, I have to have a reason
to come visit my friends?

172
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:25,533
You got the Dutchman back there, Richie.

173
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,066
Richie's back there.

174
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:29,214
Joey Gugott's over there.

175
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:31,836
The man with the tattoos,
the fucking Mummy,

176
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:33,169
and uh, Jimmy C.

177
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:35,526
Almost didn't recognize
you without the fucking

178
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:37,060
numbers under your chin.

179
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,754
- You're a funny guy, Cavelli.

180
00:08:38,754 --> 00:08:40,914
- Yeah, I'm a regular fucking Bob Hope.

181
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:42,618
- So, Detective, what can we do for you?

182
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:44,154
- It's what can I do for you.

183
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:46,856
You heard about Anthony Albano, I'm sure?

184
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:49,285
No, and Mickey, no, and Mickey O'mara,

185
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:50,154
you didn't hear about that?

186
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:50,987
Guess what?

187
00:08:50,987 --> 00:08:52,240
They're taking a big dirt
nap, somebody whacked

188
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,074
them out a few minutes ago.

189
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:55,880
- Well, it's a dangerous
neighborhood, Detective.

190
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,713
- It is a dangerous
neighborhood, you've got to be

191
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:58,200
careful, you walk out
in the street, get hit

192
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,768
by a bus or something.

193
00:08:59,768 --> 00:09:01,962
I just came here to help you.

194
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:03,231
I just want to throw
something out there to you.

195
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,331
- Is this friendly banter?

196
00:09:05,331 --> 00:09:07,529
Is that what this is?
- Friendly banter, yes.

197
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:10,093
But I'm here just to make
sure you guys are safe,

198
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:12,545
you fellows are all safe.

199
00:09:12,545 --> 00:09:15,551
- Well, if we hear anything
that can help your case,

200
00:09:15,551 --> 00:09:16,945
I'm sure we'll be happy to give

201
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:18,006
you a call.
- You know how to find me.

202
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:21,008
- Yeah, usually I look out
the window, there you are.

203
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:22,142
(laughter)

204
00:09:22,142 --> 00:09:22,975
- Good.

205
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:27,627
- You say hi to your wife.

206
00:09:27,627 --> 00:09:29,034
- Say hello to your mother.

207
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:30,661
And you, uh, say hello to
Snow White and the rest

208
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:32,328
of the fellows, huh?

209
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,773
- Where the fuck is my brother?

210
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,970
- Look, Toni, my brother's in charge now,

211
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,564
and nobody's going to get in his way.

212
00:09:45,564 --> 00:09:47,102
You and I can forget all
this nonsense, and go

213
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:48,845
to London for real this time.

214
00:09:48,845 --> 00:09:51,248
- What, and just run away?

215
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:52,529
I love this life.

216
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,178
- Your father's way of life?

217
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,817
It's over, time's changed.

218
00:09:56,817 --> 00:09:58,106
Yeah, he had long, good
run, longer than most,

219
00:09:58,106 --> 00:09:59,753
but his time was up.

220
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:01,568
You've said it to yourself 100 times.

221
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,511
- What are you saying?

222
00:10:02,511 --> 00:10:03,704
- I'm saying that I loved your father,

223
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,292
and I don't want to see
him end up like that.

224
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,575
- He really liked you, too, you know?

225
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:07,742
He really did.

226
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:11,785
- Yeah, well, birthday
bash tonight for my brother

227
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:12,866
at the club.

228
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:14,949
I'll come by before I go.

229
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:18,136
- Great day for Gaetano.

230
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:19,990
He eliminates the competition,

231
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,480
just in time for his birthday.

232
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,492
- Come on, Toni, you
know it's not like that.

233
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:26,228
This is just business, my
brother respected Anthony.

234
00:10:26,228 --> 00:10:28,395
- Mm, okay, if you say so.

235
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:33,255
- I'm going to buy the airplane tickets.

236
00:10:45,513 --> 00:10:48,096
(techno music)

237
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,563
- I told my wife that I'd be right back,

238
00:11:08,563 --> 00:11:10,095
I'd be back early, I told her.

239
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:12,061
- That's my baby, I'm telling you.

240
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:13,121
Mm wah

241
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:15,509
Come here, come here.

242
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,007
Mm wah.

243
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:17,840
- Not a bad birthday party,

244
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,222
huh brother?
- Nice job, nice job.

245
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,671
Listen, it's good to see you, you know?

246
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:25,365
I mean, I'd talk to you, but when I call,

247
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:26,239
you've got to answer.

248
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:27,072
- I'm around, man.

249
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:28,126
You don't know anything.

250
00:11:28,126 --> 00:11:28,959
- Yeah, I know anything.

251
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:29,946
But you know what?

252
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:32,349
I haven't seen you, and I
don't care what you're doing,

253
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:34,416
I don't know what you're doing, alright?

254
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,638
But when I call, you've got to show up.

255
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:37,054
- I was going over the notes.

256
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:38,213
- Uh huh.

257
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:39,479
- And you're saying 300 thousand?

258
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:40,550
- Good point.

259
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,996
- Yeah, I'm looking at my numbers,

260
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:43,273
and saying oh, we're a few,

261
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:44,596
you know, we're over a million.

262
00:11:44,596 --> 00:11:46,837
- Nah, I'm around, baby, you know that.

263
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:47,989
- Anything for you.

264
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:48,825
Well, I've got to see you more around,

265
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:49,658
I've got to see you around the club,

266
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:50,491
I've got to see you around the place,

267
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:53,066
I've got to see you at a
restaurant, I don't see you.

268
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,000
What's that about?

269
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,833
- You know, you've got to be right,

270
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,185
my loyalty's to you.

271
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:57,901
Don't ever question that, brother.

272
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:59,809
- Jimmy, come on, you can't listen to her.

273
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:01,782
- I can't listen to her?
- No.

274
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:03,862
- What are you doing, you
calling my fucking girl a liar?

275
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:04,958
- I'm not saying that, I'm just

276
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,815
saying.
- Oh, my God.

277
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:07,865
- You're in charge now, right?

278
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:09,387
Who am I to question?

279
00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:11,935
- That's right, I'm the boss.

280
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:13,367
You understand that?

281
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,704
- What are you fucking
kidding me right now?

282
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:15,630
- No, I'm not, no, listen.

283
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,754
- Let me ask you something.

284
00:12:16,754 --> 00:12:17,587
- I could show you.

285
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:18,420
Oh.

286
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,754
- I'll fucking kill you
if you fucking rob me.

287
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:20,838
You understand?

288
00:12:20,838 --> 00:12:23,411
- Now, listen, after this
Albano thing shakes out,

289
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:26,066
we're going to send you and
Jimmy on a trip, alright?

290
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:27,079
- Good, you got it.

291
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,767
Anywhere you need me to go, you know that.

292
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:30,096
- Good, you're good with that, right?

293
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:31,452
- For you, anything.

294
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:34,952
- So, what've you got set up for us after?

295
00:12:42,921 --> 00:12:44,463
- Now get the one, get that
guy right there to the right,

296
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,296
see him?

297
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:46,409
- I got him, I don't know who he is.

298
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:47,707
- Through the window, through the window.

299
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:49,615
And would you look at
the size of that house.

300
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:52,375
I mean, can you live in a house
that's the size of a hotel?

301
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,386
I mean, it's nuts.

302
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:55,233
Liberal fucking judge
couldn't give us the wiretap,

303
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,316
motherfucker.

304
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:00,789
- We need to get you and
your sister together,

305
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:02,103
go over the will.

306
00:13:02,103 --> 00:13:02,936
- Mm.

307
00:13:06,113 --> 00:13:09,454
- Hard to believe Anthony's gone.

308
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:10,287
- Yep.

309
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:14,060
Tomorrow is promised to no one.

310
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,520
- Sweet Jesus, you're cold.

311
00:13:19,351 --> 00:13:21,956
- He was your employer.

312
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:23,878
- He was more than that to me.

313
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:26,269
He kicked my ass, straightened me out.

314
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:28,436
Put me through law school.

315
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,522
- He was fucking your mother.

316
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:33,297
(click)

317
00:13:33,297 --> 00:13:35,332
(click)

318
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:37,059
- You think this is a funeral?

319
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:38,887
This is a feeding frenzy.

320
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:39,720
Wonder what's going to happen now that

321
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,001
the old man is dead, huh?

322
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:43,496
Hey, you know that, that
fucking coffee I had

323
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:46,134
this morning, my fucking
eyeballs are floating.

324
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:47,661
Look, I've got to go take a piss.

325
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:48,577
(murmuring voices)

326
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:52,077
(foreign language spoken)

327
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:02,560
- I'm very sorry to
hear about your father.

328
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,096
Listen, we're going to
need to talk though.

329
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,916
- Soon, not today, but soon.

330
00:14:05,916 --> 00:14:07,310
- I'll come back.

331
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,143
My condolences.
- Okay.

332
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,336
- Any messages?
- No.

333
00:14:18,336 --> 00:14:20,427
- You sure?
- Yes.

334
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:22,183
- You've checked that
thing like 50 fucking times

335
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:23,683
since we got here.

336
00:14:24,985 --> 00:14:26,344
Will you calm the fuck down?

337
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:28,101
You could make coffee nervous.

338
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:30,002
Waiting around here for this bitch just

339
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,586
turns my stomach.
- Would you keep

340
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:33,151
your voice down?

341
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:35,401
- Who are all these people?

342
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:39,735
- The local industry.

343
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:43,219
- I need a cigarette.
- You need a Valium,

344
00:14:43,219 --> 00:14:45,136
and a glass of bourbon.

345
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:49,680
Jesus, grow a pair of
balls, why don't you?

346
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,914
What, you think this skinny brat's going

347
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:55,081
to have you whacked just for
lighting up in her house?

348
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:58,653
- Sorry for you loss.

349
00:14:58,653 --> 00:14:59,635
- Thanks.

350
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:01,001
- We've got to talk.

351
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,060
- Well, I can't talk right now.

352
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,078
- It's kind of important.

353
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:07,702
- Joey, I've got a room full of people.

354
00:15:07,702 --> 00:15:09,703
- Understood, but soon.

355
00:15:09,703 --> 00:15:10,536
Okay.

356
00:15:12,851 --> 00:15:14,228
- Detail sucks.

357
00:15:14,228 --> 00:15:16,094
Cavelli got us this crap.

358
00:15:16,094 --> 00:15:16,927
- [Cop 1] I mean, he's not going

359
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:17,760
to sit out here in the fucking car.

360
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,643
- No, of course not.

361
00:15:18,643 --> 00:15:20,952
- If you had a chance
of banging Ava Albano,

362
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:24,127
or Toni Albano who'd you
put over the kitchen table?

363
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:25,603
I'd, I'd take Ava.

364
00:15:25,603 --> 00:15:28,745
Because Toni would put you
over the kitchen table.

365
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:31,298
Ava was on surveillance, alright?

366
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,185
And her boyfriend at the
time, she was bitching

367
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:34,692
that he bought her a necklace that

368
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:36,501
only cost 27 fucking grand.

369
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,669
So, she gets rid of the guy,
and she keeps the 27 grand.

370
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:41,327
She's like, the uh, all
the women at Hallowed Beach

371
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:42,934
in Five Towns.

372
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:44,492
By the time they're 31, 32,
they already been married

373
00:15:44,492 --> 00:15:45,927
two or three plastic
surgeons, and they're like

374
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:47,937
multi-millionaires.

375
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:50,854
- [Toni] Take a walk around, Frank.

376
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:55,535
- Don't you even want
to know how I'm doing?

377
00:15:55,535 --> 00:15:56,829
He was my father, too.

378
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:00,769
- No, Ava, I'm not interested
in your feelings right now.

379
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,265
- You like Johnny Pisano's
sausage right, I, I hear you

380
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:04,244
love Johnny Pisano's sausage.

381
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:05,481
You know why it's so good?

382
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:07,452
Because that big fat motherfucker,

383
00:16:07,452 --> 00:16:09,594
Frank-the-butcher-Marcello,

384
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,763
okay, when he kills someone,
he cuts their bodies up,

385
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,441
and it goes into the fucking sausage.

386
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:16,938
You eating like spleen, your
eating decay, and rectum.

387
00:16:16,938 --> 00:16:20,438
(foreign language spoken)

388
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,121
- You've got to make it
a a little more spicy.

389
00:16:25,121 --> 00:16:27,202
- Johnny, how much is that (foreign word)?

390
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:29,708
- Johnny, I just love your sausage.

391
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:32,419
- Well, your husband better not find out.

392
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:33,725
- We take care of that thing?
- Yeah.

393
00:16:33,725 --> 00:16:35,592
I did what you said, it's all good.

394
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:36,425
- Hold on.

395
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:37,258
Hey, Rocko.

396
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:41,607
Make something nice for
my pal, Charlie over here.

397
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:42,664
- Hey, John.

398
00:16:42,664 --> 00:16:43,941
- Hey, movie star.

399
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:45,022
Nice suit.
- Oh, you like what I'm

400
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:46,184
wearing, you want my tailor's number?

401
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:47,520
- How come you smell like Marc Anthony,

402
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,590
and I smell like provolone cheese, huh?

403
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,688
What's with this, you don't shave no more?

404
00:16:51,688 --> 00:16:53,752
- This is the style, what,
you live under a rock?

405
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:56,026
- The style comes and
goes, you know that, right?

406
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:57,268
Come on, I want to talk to you.

407
00:16:57,268 --> 00:17:00,601
You eat yet?
- No, I didn't eat anything.

408
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,639
(knocking)

409
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:08,272
- Yeah?

410
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:09,562
- I want to talk to your boss.

411
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,705
- Why, what do you want?

412
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:13,403
- Just do your job, errand
boy, and get your boss, huh?

413
00:17:13,403 --> 00:17:15,122
- Errand boy?

414
00:17:15,122 --> 00:17:16,059
- That's right.

415
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:17,205
- Is there a problem?

416
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:21,116
- I'd like to speak with
your client, Antonia Albano

417
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:22,891
- In regards to?

418
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:25,338
- In regards to the murder of
her father, Anthony Albano.

419
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:28,071
- Oh, we've already been
questioned down at the precinct.

420
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:29,752
Mrs. Albano was satisfied
that the department is doing

421
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:32,051
all it can to apprehend those responsible

422
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,352
for her father's murder.

423
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,158
Do you have other information on the case?

424
00:17:36,158 --> 00:17:37,878
- No, not this time.

425
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:38,968
- [Man Wearing Tie] Any suspects?

426
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:40,520
- Yeah, a few hundred.

427
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,608
That's not funny, Detective.

428
00:17:42,608 --> 00:17:44,907
- Sorry, Counselor.

429
00:17:44,907 --> 00:17:48,344
- Miss Albano is not available
to speak with you today.

430
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:50,833
I'm going to suggest next time
that you give a call first,

431
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,750
save yourself the trip.

432
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,943
- See you around.
- Alright, tough guy.

433
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:03,850
- [Toni] Well?

434
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,449
- [Counselor] Just a fishing expedition.

435
00:18:06,449 --> 00:18:08,910
- Is he on Nunziatta's payroll?

436
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,353
- This guy?

437
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:12,186
Nah, he's a Boy Scout.

438
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,573
- That's what I'm afraid of.

439
00:18:20,336 --> 00:18:23,135
- [Ava] Did he really
need to die like that?

440
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:24,302
Closed casket?

441
00:18:25,294 --> 00:18:27,475
- Live by the sword, die by the sword.

442
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:28,308
- Please.

443
00:18:30,305 --> 00:18:34,281
- Would you take a look
at the men surrounding us?

444
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,625
These are dangerous men, Ava.

445
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,555
And our father was their boss.

446
00:18:38,555 --> 00:18:39,920
- I don't believe that.

447
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,071
- Oh, okay, well, you just
keep your head up your ass,

448
00:18:42,071 --> 00:18:43,315
that's fine.

449
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:45,791
- Well, Rich is not like that.

450
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,708
- He's a lawyer, they're the worst.

451
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,452
- I'm going to miss Dad.

452
00:18:51,452 --> 00:18:53,039
- Oh, stop.

453
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,543
The only reason you're
here is because you need

454
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:57,126
more money for your nose candy.

455
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:01,254
- I always thought you
were a smart guy, G.

456
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:04,138
But what you did was just plain stupid.

457
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:07,888
- Albano was slowing down,
okay, he was slipping.

458
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:12,092
- We stayed off the
front pages for 25 years.

459
00:19:12,092 --> 00:19:13,096
- It couldn't be helped.

460
00:19:13,096 --> 00:19:14,378
- What'd you say?

461
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:15,613
- We discussed this.

462
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,808
- Don't play me, movie star, please.

463
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:20,022
- John, you and I both
agreed that something

464
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:21,927
had to be done with that old man.

465
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,092
- That old man?

466
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:25,354
You take it upon yourself
to whack him out,

467
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:28,532
without getting a green light
from me, or the commission?

468
00:19:28,532 --> 00:19:32,269
That's plain arrogance and stupidity.

469
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:33,798
- I'm sorry, John.

470
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,486
- Sorry don't cut it.

471
00:19:35,486 --> 00:19:36,803
We're all over the news.

472
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:39,522
Last week, Time magazine
said, "The American Mafia

473
00:19:39,522 --> 00:19:40,355
is dead."

474
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:43,938
And you, at one foolish
act, fucked it up for us.

475
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:45,437
- John,

476
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:47,946
you're like my favorite
uncle, okay, due respect,

477
00:19:47,946 --> 00:19:50,291
but you guys were moving too slow.

478
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,990
Now, I made the right move, okay?

479
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,631
It's on me, I'll take all
the heat from the commission.

480
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:57,834
- Jesus, no man's allowed in our business.

481
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:58,732
You don't get it, do you?

482
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:02,899
I saved your ass, the others
wanted you in the ground.

483
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:08,959
- Well, I appreciate
that, John, thank you.

484
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,823
But they're going to forget, okay?

485
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:12,515
The others are going to
forget once everything else

486
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:14,873
starts up again, it's going
to be business as usual.

487
00:20:14,873 --> 00:20:17,353
- What about the skirt, what about her?

488
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:19,002
- What, she's going to take a walk.

489
00:20:19,002 --> 00:20:21,224
She knows enough to
take the money and run.

490
00:20:21,224 --> 00:20:25,261
- I know Toni Albano,
she's just like her father.

491
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:26,839
- Toni Albano.

492
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:29,238
That girl'd be crazy to come at me now.

493
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:31,347
Come on, besides, I'm going
to have all the Albano

494
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:34,278
capos in my pocket by the end of the week.

495
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:38,234
- Joan of Arc, did you
ever hear of Joan of Arc?

496
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:39,067
- Yeah.

497
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:42,632
She was burned at the stake.

498
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:45,455
- I'm talking to a brick wall here.

499
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:46,737
Let me tell you something.

500
00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:50,062
You keep this up, keep going
against the commission,

501
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:51,600
nobody's ever going to save your life,

502
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,501
I won't have the juice and nobody else.

503
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:55,168
Nobody, you're dead.

504
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:57,689
- John, I'm fine.

505
00:20:58,615 --> 00:21:00,355
And so are you.

506
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:02,105
Don't worry about it.

507
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,990
- That guy Peter is here from Toronto.

508
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,674
He, he wants to see you.

509
00:21:12,674 --> 00:21:14,260
- It's okay.

510
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,510
- I'll get him.

511
00:21:21,934 --> 00:21:25,767
(man speaks foreign language)

512
00:21:27,492 --> 00:21:29,283
- Si, I understand.

513
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:33,116
(man speaks foreign language)

514
00:21:37,277 --> 00:21:39,517
Whatever arrangements
my father had with Mario

515
00:21:39,517 --> 00:21:41,479
will continue.

516
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:45,312
(man speaks foreign language)

517
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:48,889
Si.

518
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:52,722
(man speaks foreign language)

519
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,167
(Toni speaks foreign language)

520
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,127
- Get the license plates, man.

521
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:14,958
Old man, old battle, man.

522
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,883
He banged more women
than Wilt Chamberlain.

523
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:19,065
Ava and Toni, they must have
like 15 fucking brothers

524
00:22:19,065 --> 00:22:21,347
and sisters they don't know about.

525
00:22:21,347 --> 00:22:23,813
And this fucking guy didn't
believe in condoms, you know?

526
00:22:23,813 --> 00:22:26,767
Hey, Tony, put on a fucking
wrapper on your rocket, baby.

527
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:28,224
See if you can get it through
that window over there,

528
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:29,719
there, through the blinds.

529
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:32,505
- It's open, just enough.

530
00:22:32,505 --> 00:22:35,588
- Who exactly was my father, Richard?

531
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:41,012
- Your father was a complicated man.

532
00:22:41,012 --> 00:22:42,443
But he always made sure
that you and your sister

533
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:45,698
were taken care of, and
that's all you need to know.

534
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,615
- Bullshit, that's not good enough.

535
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:55,069
- So when's this boyfriend
of yours showing up?

536
00:22:56,107 --> 00:22:57,336
You know your father
was not happy with you

537
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:59,419
living up in Connecticut.

538
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,403
- I know, I needed to get away.

539
00:23:08,182 --> 00:23:09,476
- Well, we need to sit
down with your sister,

540
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:11,976
and go over your dad's assets.

541
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:14,541
- Mm hm, I know.

542
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:17,845
- Okay.
- Okay.

543
00:23:22,997 --> 00:23:25,218
- Well, check this out,
check it out, man, oh.

544
00:23:25,218 --> 00:23:26,051
(click)

545
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:27,680
Shit, that's got to be one
of old Donald's girlfriends.

546
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,975
Holy shit!
- Oh, that's a wide load, huh?

547
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,849
- Oh, man.
- Well, maybe we should do

548
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:34,132
that, set a later date,
say next week in my office.

549
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:35,636
- Jesus.
- Toni's coming out

550
00:23:35,636 --> 00:23:36,625
of the house.

551
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,261
- Look, sweetie pie, I'm
not leaving here until

552
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:39,380
we see that will.

553
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,552
- Ah, you look well rested.

554
00:23:41,552 --> 00:23:44,782
- Oh, let's cut the bullshit, shall we?

555
00:23:44,782 --> 00:23:46,567
- What are you doing here today?

556
00:23:46,567 --> 00:23:48,571
- I want what's mine, what's owed to me.

557
00:23:48,571 --> 00:23:50,918
- My father took care of you quite well.

558
00:23:50,918 --> 00:23:52,154
- Nice try, honey.

559
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:53,162
Your father loved me.

560
00:23:53,162 --> 00:23:56,145
After your mother died,
I made him very happy.

561
00:23:56,145 --> 00:23:58,286
- My father had needs like any man, and

562
00:23:58,286 --> 00:23:59,649
that was his business.

563
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:02,196
But he gave you cars, he gave
you the clothes on your back,

564
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:04,660
the condo you live in,
and God knows what else.

565
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,673
- He loved me.
- Look, you were just the end

566
00:24:06,673 --> 00:24:09,322
of a long line of sluts
that my father was banging.

567
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,981
- I should kick your teeth
in, you selfish skinny brat!

568
00:24:11,981 --> 00:24:14,547
- Your talk is as cheap as you are.

569
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:16,932
- I don't have an army of
goons to back me up, honey.

570
00:24:16,932 --> 00:24:18,265
- No, you don't.

571
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:22,525
So, whatever's in the
joint account, is yours.

572
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:23,358
You can have it.

573
00:24:23,358 --> 00:24:24,546
- He promised me, he told me.
- You were

574
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,306
fucking my father while
my mother was still alive!

575
00:24:27,306 --> 00:24:31,260
- He said he was very grateful for it.

576
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,158
- Get the fuck out of here.

577
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:35,179
- Don't fuck with me, Toni.

578
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:37,363
- And if you go to the cops,

579
00:24:37,363 --> 00:24:38,788
or the press,

580
00:24:38,788 --> 00:24:41,202
I'll fuck you good.

581
00:24:41,202 --> 00:24:44,369
(click, click, click)

582
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:48,812
- No, I got him, too.

583
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:50,541
- Yeah, good on his mama looks.

584
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:53,124
(click, click)

585
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:57,883
- [Toni] How's business, Norton?

586
00:24:57,883 --> 00:24:59,525
- It's alright.

587
00:24:59,525 --> 00:25:01,843
Did you see the arrangement
me and Carney sent?

588
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:04,497
- [Toni] Yeah, it must've cost you plenty.

589
00:25:04,497 --> 00:25:06,961
- Oh, we figured it was
the least we could do.

590
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:08,234
- You should've put some
of that money towards

591
00:25:08,234 --> 00:25:10,151
what you owe my family.

592
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,376
- Well, I,

593
00:25:13,672 --> 00:25:16,577
we came here today.
- To jerk me off?

594
00:25:16,577 --> 00:25:17,917
- No, not at all.

595
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:20,231
- 165 thousand dollars.

596
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:21,982
That's what you owe.
- What?

597
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:23,977
- Mickey O'mara, he's not here now.

598
00:25:23,977 --> 00:25:24,810
He's gone.

599
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,694
He's not here to run interference

600
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:28,998
for you two degenerates.

601
00:25:28,998 --> 00:25:31,915
I expect you to pay the
money you owe my family

602
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:33,794
by the end of this month.

603
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:35,731
- You can't be serious.

604
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:38,179
- I'm as serious as a heart attack.

605
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:41,854
- Hey, business has been very
good for you two fucking guys.

606
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:43,828
Besides all the money you're
making with the bulls,

607
00:25:43,828 --> 00:25:46,322
and those fucking lap dances.

608
00:25:46,322 --> 00:25:48,475
And don't think we don't know
about those fucking whores

609
00:25:48,475 --> 00:25:52,028
and the coke deals these
guys are doing on the side.

610
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:53,742
We know every fucking thing.

611
00:25:53,742 --> 00:25:55,518
You understand?

612
00:25:55,518 --> 00:25:57,679
- I just.
- Think, before you utter

613
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,762
another word.

614
00:26:02,867 --> 00:26:04,700
I never liked you two.

615
00:26:06,655 --> 00:26:08,214
I want my money,

616
00:26:08,214 --> 00:26:10,634
and I want it by the end of the month.

617
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:12,756
And if you're thinking
about blowing me off,

618
00:26:12,756 --> 00:26:15,797
or running away, Frank
will bring you back,

619
00:26:15,797 --> 00:26:17,274
he will find you,

620
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:19,183
and it will give me great
pleasure to watch him

621
00:26:19,183 --> 00:26:20,766
cut your balls off.

622
00:26:24,258 --> 00:26:25,591
Have a nice day.

623
00:26:30,443 --> 00:26:32,443
By the end of the month.

624
00:26:38,341 --> 00:26:41,508
(dreary, heavy music)

625
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:01,739
(flushing)

626
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,022
- They may let you keep the house.

627
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:18,412
The rest is gone, you're
out of the family business.

628
00:27:18,412 --> 00:27:20,965
- I am the daughter of Anthony Albano,

629
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:22,815
I will not end up like the others.

630
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:25,314
- Toni, you know these
thick, heavy gimmes,

631
00:27:25,314 --> 00:27:26,938
they'll think nothing
about slitting your throat

632
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:28,634
from ear to ear.

633
00:27:28,634 --> 00:27:30,374
Since the feds froze you
and your dad's assets,

634
00:27:30,374 --> 00:27:31,586
you're basically, uh.
- Fucked, yeah.

635
00:27:31,586 --> 00:27:34,198
I know that, listen, we've
got to clean up this mess.

636
00:27:34,198 --> 00:27:35,974
I need a meeting with Gaetano.

637
00:27:35,974 --> 00:27:38,127
- You're just putting off the inevitable.

638
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:40,954
Gaetano's been after your dad's
piece of the pie for years.

639
00:27:40,954 --> 00:27:42,774
You don't have the support
of the other families,

640
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:46,842
your own people'll be jumping ship soon.

641
00:27:46,842 --> 00:27:49,092
(thudding)

642
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:55,812
(grunting)

643
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:56,895
- Yeah, nice.

644
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:03,387
Hey, what's up, Jimmy?

645
00:28:03,387 --> 00:28:04,220
- Hey.

646
00:28:06,176 --> 00:28:07,009
What's going on, Jim?

647
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:08,496
- Hold on with it.

648
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:09,619
- Yeah, I've got to
stay in shape, you know,

649
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:10,646
we've got a lot of shit going on.

650
00:28:10,646 --> 00:28:11,479
- Stay in shape?

651
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:12,312
Looks like you're trying to give yourself

652
00:28:12,312 --> 00:28:13,145
a fucking heart attack.

653
00:28:13,145 --> 00:28:14,358
(laughter)

654
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:18,001
- So, how we doing that
Albanos over there?

655
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:19,344
- Just like we said.

656
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:21,340
They're running like fucking cockroaches.

657
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,226
Like chickens without heads.

658
00:28:23,226 --> 00:28:24,589
- Yeah.

659
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:29,037
Those skeletons are going to
start crawling over here now.

660
00:28:29,037 --> 00:28:31,296
You heard from my brother?

661
00:28:31,296 --> 00:28:32,923
It's inevitable.

662
00:28:32,923 --> 00:28:34,334
If this sells, you're going to get him

663
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:35,398
to do some work around here.

664
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:36,894
- I talk to you, that's your call, Boss.

665
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:38,477
- Free ride's over.

666
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:41,167
Anybody else reach out?
- Yeah, that fucking

667
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:43,253
asshole, Pasqual.

668
00:28:43,253 --> 00:28:46,509
He's already trying to have a sit-down.

669
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:47,763
- We have a lot of his shit.

670
00:28:47,763 --> 00:28:50,054
- Oh, yeah, you have no idea.

671
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:52,851
- Alright, how about a pot of coffee?

672
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:55,581
We're going to get a lot
of sit-downs like this.

673
00:28:55,581 --> 00:28:56,414
- Come on.

674
00:29:02,348 --> 00:29:05,319
(rapid thudding)

675
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,434
- Toni.

676
00:29:06,434 --> 00:29:10,058
Joey Apples and Pasqual
want to see you tonight.

677
00:29:10,058 --> 00:29:13,058
- Tell them not too late, I'm tired.

678
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:16,759
(chime tones)

679
00:29:22,247 --> 00:29:23,920
(knocking)

680
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,420
- Your boyfriend's here, from Connecticut.

681
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,277
- Oh, Michael, thank God.

682
00:29:43,229 --> 00:29:45,109
- That knuckle dragger,
Frank, he wouldn't let me

683
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:49,633
up here till I showed him a
picture of you on my cellphone.

684
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:52,518
- Well, I hope I was decent.

685
00:29:52,518 --> 00:29:54,192
- What do you need, Joey?

686
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,274
- I need to know when you're
moving out of this house.

687
00:29:56,274 --> 00:29:59,047
My moving company could come
in here, pack up your stuff,

688
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,685
and send it anywhere you want.

689
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:02,403
- This ain't no social call, Toni.

690
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:04,473
You and I, we have unfinished business.

691
00:30:04,473 --> 00:30:05,909
I want what's owed to me.

692
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:09,093
- The Albanos have lived
in this house for 40 years.

693
00:30:09,093 --> 00:30:12,598
And on your say so, a
captain, in my family,

694
00:30:12,598 --> 00:30:14,327
you're going to toss
us out onto the street?

695
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:15,648
Oh, I don't think so.

696
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,310
- Before you go handing over
all your assets to Gaetano,

697
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:20,172
you better make sure you
pay me my part of the split

698
00:30:20,172 --> 00:30:21,400
from the airport job.

699
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,361
- What are you talking about?

700
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:23,642
- Don't be cute with me, Toni,

701
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:25,597
and don't play me for no fucking fool.

702
00:30:25,597 --> 00:30:27,732
You and I both know
Gaetano's moving in here.

703
00:30:27,732 --> 00:30:30,555
- This home is the property
of double A Construction.

704
00:30:30,555 --> 00:30:31,388
(Toni laughs)

705
00:30:31,388 --> 00:30:32,781
You and your sister are
a tiny part of that.

706
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:34,774
You're going to sell this fucking joint.

707
00:30:34,774 --> 00:30:36,014
- Well, if you feel
that way, why aren't you

708
00:30:36,014 --> 00:30:37,342
talking to Gaetano?

709
00:30:37,342 --> 00:30:38,974
- Gaetano's no fool.

710
00:30:38,974 --> 00:30:41,278
He knows it's been you
running things around here.

711
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:43,000
He's been looking to take over
the Albano family for years,

712
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,363
but just couldn't do it.

713
00:30:44,363 --> 00:30:46,120
- Joey Apples.

714
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,018
You call yourself a friend of my father's.

715
00:30:49,018 --> 00:30:52,237
If he were here to see this,
he'd, he'd cave in your head

716
00:30:52,237 --> 00:30:53,866
with a brick.

717
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:55,717
- Bottom line, Toni, is you owe me.

718
00:30:55,717 --> 00:30:57,394
This whole family owes me.

719
00:30:57,394 --> 00:30:59,447
Me and my crew, we've
been kicking back party.

720
00:30:59,447 --> 00:31:01,364
I've been a loyal capo
to you and your father,

721
00:31:01,364 --> 00:31:02,367
and you know it.

722
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:05,366
- Listen, your father was my
boss, and he was my friend.

723
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:06,880
Business is business.

724
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,441
One way or the other,
you're going to be out

725
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:09,370
of this fucking house.

726
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,754
So out of respect for
him, pack up your shit.

727
00:31:12,754 --> 00:31:13,992
- I owe you nothing.

728
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:16,466
I'll burn it down to the ground first.

729
00:31:16,466 --> 00:31:19,238
The family's froze me
out, no broad's allowed,

730
00:31:19,238 --> 00:31:20,830
it's a boy's club only, remember?

731
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,663
- You want to run this family?

732
00:31:21,663 --> 00:31:22,965
You want to keep your territories?

733
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:24,143
Back me.

734
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:25,705
You back me, I'll run this family.

735
00:31:25,705 --> 00:31:28,105
Yeah.
- You'll run my family?

736
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:30,487
- I'll run this family, and
we'll make money together.

737
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:31,984
- For years, I stood in
your father's shadow,

738
00:31:31,984 --> 00:31:34,459
listening to your fucking bullshit.

739
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,227
Those days are over, girl.

740
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,006
- I'll survive.
- No, this is where

741
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:38,839
you're wrong.

742
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,085
And you'll see it soon,

743
00:31:40,085 --> 00:31:42,092
and then you'll be crawling back to me.

744
00:31:42,092 --> 00:31:44,675
- Fucking bullets will explode.

745
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:47,383
- You think about it.

746
00:31:53,355 --> 00:31:56,105
(dramatic music)

747
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,224
- [Ralph] Look, Toni, my
brother's in charge now,

748
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:13,609
and nobody's going to get in his way.

749
00:32:13,609 --> 00:32:15,090
- You're just putting off the inevitable.

750
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,527
- [Richard] Gaetano's
been after your dad's

751
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:17,420
piece of the pie for years.

752
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,334
- [Joey] No one's going
to back you now that

753
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:19,307
your old man's in the ground.

754
00:32:19,307 --> 00:32:20,690
- You don't have the support
of the other families,

755
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,496
your own people'll be jumping ship soon.

756
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:24,498
- Your father's way of life,
it's over, time's changed.

757
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:27,157
Out of respect for him, pack up your shit.

758
00:32:27,157 --> 00:32:29,455
- [Pasqual] You owe me,
this whole family owes me.

759
00:32:29,455 --> 00:32:31,085
- He was my father, too.

760
00:32:31,085 --> 00:32:32,688
Don't you even want to know how I'm doing?

761
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:35,289
- I'm not interested in
your feelings right now.

762
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,908
(man speaking foreign language)

763
00:32:36,908 --> 00:32:38,122
- [Joey] One way or the
other, you're going to get out

764
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,238
of this fucking house.

765
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:40,514
- [Toni] I'll burn it to the ground first.

766
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:41,701
- [Richard] It's hard to
believe Anthony's gone.

767
00:32:41,701 --> 00:32:44,451
- Tomorrow is promised to no one.

768
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:53,142
I'll survive.

769
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:56,988
(suspenseful music)

770
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:08,838
- Where is she?
- Sleeping.

771
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,900
- I'm going to wake her up.

772
00:33:16,552 --> 00:33:17,754
Have you lost your mind?

773
00:33:17,754 --> 00:33:19,519
You told Joey Apples you're staying put?

774
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,645
Hm?

775
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:22,435
- Bad news travels fast.

776
00:33:22,435 --> 00:33:23,305
- What the hell's got into you?

777
00:33:23,305 --> 00:33:25,422
I thought we were getting
out of here together.

778
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,486
- You know the U.S. Attorney's
office, they've frozen

779
00:33:27,486 --> 00:33:29,041
all my accounts.

780
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,884
I have no access to anything
overseas, I'm totally fucked.

781
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,790
I'm lucky I have cash in the safe.

782
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,500
- [Ralph] I have enough for
the both of us, you know that.

783
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,820
- Well, that's not good enough.

784
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,918
I'm not leaving like that.

785
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:41,182
- Well, I can't save you if you stay.

786
00:33:41,182 --> 00:33:42,960
What do you want from me, huh?

787
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,110
Let's forget about all
this bullshit, and meet

788
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,469
in London like we planned.

789
00:33:46,469 --> 00:33:48,942
- It's over, I'm not going anywhere.

790
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:50,362
Your brother's going to
try to take everything

791
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,710
from me, and you're not
lifting a finger to stop him.

792
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,232
- You didn't expect me to
cross my own brother, did you?

793
00:33:55,232 --> 00:33:57,565
I did the best that I could.

794
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:00,874
- Well, that's not good enough.

795
00:34:00,874 --> 00:34:03,812
- [Ralph] What are you saying?

796
00:34:03,812 --> 00:34:05,384
- I'm going to have to kill your brother.

797
00:34:05,384 --> 00:34:06,218
- What?

798
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:07,788
That's never going to fucking happen.

799
00:34:07,788 --> 00:34:09,288
- Really?
- Really.

800
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:12,471
You could never get to my brother anyway.

801
00:34:12,471 --> 00:34:14,800
You'd have to go through
Scarpetta, Jeruso, Tommy,

802
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,894
Tat, Junior fucking Almato, Jimmy C.

803
00:34:17,894 --> 00:34:18,727
and me.

804
00:34:22,732 --> 00:34:23,565
- Goodbye.

805
00:34:26,553 --> 00:34:29,303
(dramatic music)

806
00:34:30,576 --> 00:34:32,076
I'm sorry, Ralphy.

807
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:38,683
And just for the record,
you were a lousy lay.

808
00:34:43,952 --> 00:34:46,460
- You know, this wasn't in the plan.

809
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,198
- Things change.

810
00:34:48,198 --> 00:34:50,065
Can you clean this up?

811
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:52,585
- Sure, that's what I do, remember?

812
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:55,788
- Do I have blood on my face?

813
00:34:55,788 --> 00:34:57,455
- No, you look good.

814
00:35:12,805 --> 00:35:13,722
- Hi.
- Hey.

815
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:17,415
- I called St. Vincent's,
and they're going to come

816
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,510
pick up my dad's things tomorrow.

817
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,010
You know, we used to be close.

818
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:27,632
We used to play here all the time.

819
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:32,268
But after Mom died, she changed.

820
00:35:32,268 --> 00:35:36,242
It was like, well, everything changed.

821
00:35:36,242 --> 00:35:37,870
But especially Toni.

822
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,761
She started acting like my mother.

823
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:44,858
She was controlling, she wanted
to know every move I made,

824
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:48,249
I had a mother, I didn't need her.

825
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:49,166
So, I left.

826
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:53,420
And I never regretted it, really.

827
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,253
Till now.

828
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,239
- Clancy?

829
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,072
Fuck him.

830
00:35:59,072 --> 00:36:01,254
The deal died with
Clancy when Anthony died.

831
00:36:01,254 --> 00:36:04,441
- You saw Toni, and I know
because I paid a visit myself.

832
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:06,338
The future of the Albano
family's got one foot

833
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:08,278
on the fucking banana peel.

834
00:36:08,278 --> 00:36:10,243
- This whole fucking thing is upside down.

835
00:36:10,243 --> 00:36:11,439
We're under new management now.

836
00:36:11,439 --> 00:36:12,646
We'll see what we can
get, you know, a little

837
00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:13,951
bit of something.

838
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:16,655
It's better than nothing.

839
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:17,822
- Take a seat.

840
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,021
I'd offer you a cup of
coffee, but you look

841
00:36:21,021 --> 00:36:22,438
like a live wire.

842
00:36:23,886 --> 00:36:25,689
What's on your mind?

843
00:36:25,689 --> 00:36:28,324
- I was thinking maybe we should talk.

844
00:36:28,324 --> 00:36:29,493
- The boss isn't even cold yet, and you're

845
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:31,394
looking out for your future?

846
00:36:31,394 --> 00:36:34,395
- Yeah, I, I got a few
questions I need to ask.

847
00:36:34,395 --> 00:36:36,520
What's going to happen to my crew?

848
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,756
Who's going to run my family?

849
00:36:37,756 --> 00:36:40,613
You know what I'm talking about?

850
00:36:40,613 --> 00:36:42,956
- Your family died with your boss.

851
00:36:42,956 --> 00:36:43,789
Get it?

852
00:36:45,795 --> 00:36:48,260
- I was thinking maybe me and Joey Apples.

853
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,768
We could, uh, make a deal
with you and the other

854
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:51,762
five families.

855
00:36:51,762 --> 00:36:53,622
- What's a five letter word for idiot?

856
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:54,455
- Moron.

857
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,537
- Moron.

858
00:36:59,274 --> 00:37:03,496
You and Joey Apples don't
got the weight to make deals.

859
00:37:03,496 --> 00:37:05,435
Now, me and the other
bosses, we talked about it,

860
00:37:05,435 --> 00:37:09,406
and we think the best thing
is to split up that family.

861
00:37:09,406 --> 00:37:12,661
- Gaetano's a fucking snake,
Toni's a fucking broad,

862
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:14,456
who the fuck would think
a fucking broad, I mean,

863
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:17,045
what the fuck is the world coming to?

864
00:37:17,045 --> 00:37:19,453
- Listen, the two of us, we've
just got to stick together,

865
00:37:19,453 --> 00:37:20,505
and we'll get through this.

866
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:21,338
Agreed?

867
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:22,171
- Alright.

868
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:24,724
- You alright?

869
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:26,000
You want a glass of water or something?

870
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,833
Cosmo.

871
00:37:27,785 --> 00:37:31,535
Get this gentleman a
nice glass of ice water.

872
00:37:34,177 --> 00:37:35,390
You didn't happen to
see my brother, Ralphy

873
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,258
over at Albano's, did you?

874
00:37:37,258 --> 00:37:41,900
- No, I wasn't there that
long, I didn't see nobody.

875
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,817
- You sure?

876
00:37:43,751 --> 00:37:45,270
- 100 percent.

877
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,770
- He's not answering his cell.

878
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,815
- Have you seen Ralph?

879
00:37:49,815 --> 00:37:51,357
I've been trying to get ahold
of him on his cellphone,

880
00:37:51,357 --> 00:37:53,907
and I'm not getting dick.

881
00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:57,323
- Listen, he's upstairs with the boss.

882
00:37:57,323 --> 00:37:59,162
You know what I mean.
- Yeah, but.

883
00:37:59,162 --> 00:38:01,049
- Just leave them alone right now.

884
00:38:01,049 --> 00:38:02,405
It's no big deal.

885
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,816
Don't bother them, alright?

886
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:05,662
We'll go up by the garage,

887
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:07,205
I've got a nice bottle
of bourbon in there.

888
00:38:07,205 --> 00:38:08,958
You, you like cigars?

889
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:10,458
Smoke a cigar too.

890
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:13,436
- I don't get it, Frank

891
00:38:13,436 --> 00:38:15,748
Why are you still here?

892
00:38:15,748 --> 00:38:17,739
- [Frank] I'm a creature of habit.

893
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:20,257
- So the broad, Toni.

894
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,034
- You know I could help you with her.

895
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:24,743
- You're a smart fellow, Pasqual.

896
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:27,380
But don't try to play me.

897
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,332
You saw your boss go in the
ground, you figured you'd be

898
00:38:29,332 --> 00:38:32,005
right after him, right,
so you come over here?

899
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:34,414
Now, I know you and your
crew have been busting

900
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:36,021
those banks up in Queens and Brooklyn.

901
00:38:36,021 --> 00:38:37,193
How many banks, Jimmy?

902
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:38,843
- 23.

903
00:38:38,843 --> 00:38:40,443
- 23.

904
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,111
Holy shit.
- Fucking guy?

905
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:44,892
- That's pretty good.

906
00:38:44,892 --> 00:38:47,471
But I also know that you
didn't kick back Albano's taste

907
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:48,638
on those jobs.

908
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,438
Now if you did that with me,

909
00:38:52,438 --> 00:38:54,178
you'd be fish food.

910
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:56,928
(dramatic music)

911
00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:01,281
That's not going to happen with me.

912
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:03,123
You're going to continue
to be a good earner,

913
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:04,728
you're going to be a real team player.

914
00:39:04,728 --> 00:39:06,356
From now on.

915
00:39:06,356 --> 00:39:07,606
You understand?

916
00:39:08,703 --> 00:39:10,440
- I understand.

917
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,357
(boom)

918
00:39:14,281 --> 00:39:15,691
- Hey.

919
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:17,264
You got promoted to the majors.

920
00:39:17,264 --> 00:39:19,326
You got traded to my team.

921
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:20,363
Look at it that way.

922
00:39:20,363 --> 00:39:22,863
- Hm.
- We're clear now, right?

923
00:39:26,288 --> 00:39:27,833
Now, what did Cavelli want?

924
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:28,666
- Cavelli?

925
00:39:30,153 --> 00:39:30,986
- Boys.

926
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:32,553
So how's things in the smut business?

927
00:39:32,553 --> 00:39:33,922
- How the fuck did you get in here?

928
00:39:33,922 --> 00:39:35,282
- Door was open.

929
00:39:35,282 --> 00:39:37,245
- [Man Seated] You just
can't come waltzing in here.

930
00:39:37,245 --> 00:39:39,240
- You don't like it, call a cop.

931
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,821
- Can I get you something, Detective?

932
00:39:40,821 --> 00:39:42,076
How about a cup of coffee?

933
00:39:42,076 --> 00:39:43,710
- How about a little lawsuit?

934
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,914
(laughter)

935
00:39:44,914 --> 00:39:48,761
- That fucking coat,
that's a good one, Joe.

936
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,515
- Nice fucking cigars you got here.

937
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:51,915
- Yeah, what do you want here, Detective?

938
00:39:51,915 --> 00:39:54,311
- Just here investigating
the Albano homicide.

939
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:55,712
- Let me ask you something.

940
00:39:55,712 --> 00:39:58,501
What are you fucking down
here breaking our balls for?

941
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:01,041
You know we ain't going to
talk to no fucking copper.

942
00:40:01,041 --> 00:40:02,822
- Joey, he ain't that smart.

943
00:40:02,822 --> 00:40:05,352
He thinks me and you
whacked Anthony Albano.

944
00:40:05,352 --> 00:40:07,779
- I just got to take you
pricks off my list, that's all.

945
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:10,612
Now, um, Don Joses, Luis Casillas?

946
00:40:12,101 --> 00:40:13,211
It's a beautiful cigar.

947
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,805
You know, a fucking truckload
of these were lifted

948
00:40:14,805 --> 00:40:16,905
from LaGuardia Airport.

949
00:40:16,905 --> 00:40:18,900
- You don't say.
- Yeah.

950
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,350
But, you two wouldn't know
anything about it anyway.

951
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,314
- What are the odds?

952
00:40:22,314 --> 00:40:23,147
What a fucking

953
00:40:23,147 --> 00:40:24,275
amazing coincidence.
- What's this

954
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:25,862
fucking world coming to, Detective?

955
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:27,680
- Yeah.
- Well, listen boys,

956
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,763
thanks for the cigar, and
uh, try to stay healthy, huh?

957
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:32,787
- He was just fucking with
us, he doesn't know nothing.

958
00:40:32,787 --> 00:40:34,745
- You talk to that scumbag cop again,

959
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:36,822
I'll kill you myself.

960
00:40:36,822 --> 00:40:38,072
- It's alright.

961
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:44,854
You just keep you mouth shut
from here on in, alright?

962
00:40:44,854 --> 00:40:47,187
Does that sound like a plan?

963
00:40:48,278 --> 00:40:49,222
Alright, get the fuck out
of here and do whatever

964
00:40:49,222 --> 00:40:50,305
it is you do.

965
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:58,921
- He ain't going to fuck with me.

966
00:41:02,946 --> 00:41:06,696
- I'm going to need
another word for asshole.

967
00:41:12,618 --> 00:41:14,368
- Everything alright?

968
00:41:15,293 --> 00:41:16,710
- Yeah, I.
- What?

969
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:19,881
- I just needed a quiet
place to make a phone call.

970
00:41:19,881 --> 00:41:21,888
Emergency at work.

971
00:41:21,888 --> 00:41:24,888
(suspenseful music)

972
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:35,390
- Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

973
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:38,598
Why is Sal driving Ralphy boy's car?

974
00:41:38,598 --> 00:41:40,644
Fuck it, come on, let's tail him.

975
00:41:40,644 --> 00:41:43,394
(dramatic music)

976
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:52,526
- Oh, it's a pleasure to finally meet you.

977
00:41:52,526 --> 00:41:53,526
I'm Michael.

978
00:41:54,388 --> 00:41:55,562
- What is it you do?

979
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:56,566
- Travel agent.

980
00:41:56,566 --> 00:41:59,159
I own a small agency in New Haven.

981
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,807
- And my fiance.

982
00:42:00,807 --> 00:42:01,640
- Ah.

983
00:42:04,194 --> 00:42:05,929
Irish, nice curtains.

984
00:42:05,929 --> 00:42:07,513
Mother took good care of you.

985
00:42:07,513 --> 00:42:08,911
Congratulations.

986
00:42:08,911 --> 00:42:10,640
I'm sure you'll both be very happy.

987
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,904
Now, if you could excuse us

988
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:14,096
for a moment.
- He stays with me.

989
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:15,688
- This is family business.
- Yeah, that's for the

990
00:42:15,688 --> 00:42:18,394
best, Ava.
- Stay out of this, Richard.

991
00:42:18,394 --> 00:42:19,731
- It's okay, Ava.

992
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:23,064
I'll be outside the door if you need me.

993
00:42:24,425 --> 00:42:25,758
- Oh, good Lord.

994
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,290
Okay, what do we got?

995
00:42:30,495 --> 00:42:34,328
- Your dad left you each
500 thousand dollars.

996
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:36,384
- And?

997
00:42:37,219 --> 00:42:38,552
- And that's it.

998
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:44,596
- Joey said he expected us to vacate.

999
00:42:44,596 --> 00:42:46,189
- What?
- He said the house was

1000
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:49,449
in the company's name,
now how that could be,

1001
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:50,321
I don't know.

1002
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:52,484
- I assumed you knew.

1003
00:42:52,484 --> 00:42:53,803
The house was under the
company contract, but I

1004
00:42:53,803 --> 00:42:55,854
never dreamed that they
would as you to leave.

1005
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:57,465
- Well, that's not happening.

1006
00:42:57,465 --> 00:43:00,089
I'm not going to bend over
for these motherfuckers.

1007
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:01,922
I'm keeping control over what's mine.

1008
00:43:01,922 --> 00:43:04,150
- You are not in control over anything.

1009
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,015
Legally, it's not yours.

1010
00:43:06,015 --> 00:43:08,074
Everybody knew that you were
running the Albano family,

1011
00:43:08,074 --> 00:43:10,270
your power came from your father.

1012
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,034
- This is the life he gave me.

1013
00:43:12,034 --> 00:43:14,680
This is the only life I know.

1014
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,500
I will keep this family's assets.

1015
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,506
And I will not go down without a fight.

1016
00:43:19,506 --> 00:43:22,028
- You've burned bridges,
you have no allies.

1017
00:43:22,028 --> 00:43:24,354
All the other families knew
that Anthony was slipping.

1018
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:28,064
You running the family kept
him alive another two years.

1019
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,109
You know how these grease balls think, uh,

1020
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:31,917
as long as everybody's
making money, they'll look

1021
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:33,717
the other way.

1022
00:43:33,717 --> 00:43:37,492
- 500 thousand dollars is
not going to last long.

1023
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:38,888
- You must have something stashed away.

1024
00:43:38,888 --> 00:43:41,725
- You know, I've heard enough.

1025
00:43:41,725 --> 00:43:43,424
- You are not going anywhere until

1026
00:43:43,424 --> 00:43:45,697
I tell you.
- You don't have the right to.

1027
00:43:45,697 --> 00:43:48,649
- It is not safe out
there, I can't protect you.

1028
00:43:48,649 --> 00:43:49,844
- Protect me?

1029
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:52,788
- These are associates
of our father, they won't

1030
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:55,024
hesitate to kill you and dump your body,

1031
00:43:55,024 --> 00:43:57,902
do you understand?
- I am not a part of this.

1032
00:43:57,902 --> 00:43:59,492
- You are.
- I am not a part of this.

1033
00:43:59,492 --> 00:44:02,705
- You're an Alabano, by
defacto, you are a part of this.

1034
00:44:02,705 --> 00:44:04,543
They'll try to use you to get to me,

1035
00:44:04,543 --> 00:44:07,960
what aren't you understanding about this?

1036
00:44:09,051 --> 00:44:12,468
- She's right, sweetheart, you're fucked.

1037
00:44:15,144 --> 00:44:16,156
- You're not going anywhere, now,

1038
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:18,807
get out of here.
- Oh, don't even tell me.

1039
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:20,200
- And get me Frank.
- You ladies

1040
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,950
need to make a truce.

1041
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:26,317
- My sister can be such a bitch.

1042
00:44:26,317 --> 00:44:27,659
You know, she can't make me stay.

1043
00:44:27,659 --> 00:44:29,019
- Maybe we should stay a little while,

1044
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:30,563
give her a chance to
get to know me better.

1045
00:44:30,563 --> 00:44:33,090
- You don't know my sister.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1046
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,831
Things change, give it a chance.

1047
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:39,434
Look, we'll get your
finances in order first.

1048
00:44:39,434 --> 00:44:42,086
- I just inherited a
half a million dollars.

1049
00:44:42,086 --> 00:44:43,032
Right?

1050
00:44:43,032 --> 00:44:43,865
- Hm.
- So.

1051
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:46,900
That's going to take care of my debt,

1052
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,032
and then you'll take care of me.

1053
00:44:48,032 --> 00:44:49,223
(cellphone ringing)

1054
00:44:49,223 --> 00:44:50,866
- I, uh, I've got to take this.

1055
00:44:50,866 --> 00:44:51,763
- Really?

1056
00:44:51,763 --> 00:44:53,319
You can't call him back?
- It can't wait.

1057
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:55,319
Emergency at the office.

1058
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,952
You're going to get me
killed, you know that?

1059
00:45:02,952 --> 00:45:04,619
Yeah, I placed them.

1060
00:45:05,784 --> 00:45:09,775
Hey, look, you guys got my back, right?

1061
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:12,525
(dramatic music)

1062
00:45:16,768 --> 00:45:17,986
- What are you doing, my man?

1063
00:45:17,986 --> 00:45:19,894
- Uh, dumping some garbage.

1064
00:45:19,894 --> 00:45:22,838
- Police, show me your hands.

1065
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:23,971
Come on!

1066
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:24,804
- Gun!

1067
00:45:24,804 --> 00:45:27,971
(succession of shots)

1068
00:45:33,788 --> 00:45:37,557
(cellphone ringing)

1069
00:45:37,557 --> 00:45:38,390
- Yeah?

1070
00:45:39,712 --> 00:45:40,545
What?

1071
00:45:41,523 --> 00:45:42,674
No, no, no.

1072
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:44,054
Say that again?

1073
00:45:44,054 --> 00:45:44,986
Where are they?

1074
00:45:44,986 --> 00:45:47,653
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

1075
00:45:47,653 --> 00:45:49,530
Calm the fuck down.

1076
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:50,931
Just tell me what happened.

1077
00:45:50,931 --> 00:45:52,337
Where are the feds?

1078
00:45:52,337 --> 00:45:53,546
Who called them off?

1079
00:45:53,546 --> 00:45:55,307
Who's watching the fucking house?

1080
00:45:55,307 --> 00:45:56,329
What do you mean nobody?

1081
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:57,673
No, I'm not fucking yelling at you.

1082
00:45:57,673 --> 00:45:59,678
Alright, fuck this shit.

1083
00:45:59,678 --> 00:46:00,861
Where, where are the cops?

1084
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:03,146
Listen, tell their
wives, get somebody here

1085
00:46:03,146 --> 00:46:05,721
to pick them up, and I'll
meet you at the hospital, man.

1086
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,554
Fuck.

1087
00:46:10,445 --> 00:46:11,579
- Where's my sister?

1088
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:13,016
- Upstairs.

1089
00:46:13,016 --> 00:46:15,488
Look, I know things
have been tough for you,

1090
00:46:15,488 --> 00:46:18,368
and you haven't exactly been close.

1091
00:46:18,368 --> 00:46:20,194
Maybe you can put aside your differences

1092
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,159
and be a real family.

1093
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:23,637
- Mm.

1094
00:46:23,637 --> 00:46:27,753
Look, Dr. Phil, you don't
know me, and I don't know you,

1095
00:46:27,753 --> 00:46:29,991
and you sure as shit don't
know anything about my family,

1096
00:46:29,991 --> 00:46:32,039
so take some friendly advice,

1097
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,789
and go fuck yourself.

1098
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:40,862
What, are you fleecing the place?

1099
00:46:40,862 --> 00:46:42,457
Your boyfriends not going
to be able to help you

1100
00:46:42,457 --> 00:46:44,382
when the bull dykes
start passing you around

1101
00:46:44,382 --> 00:46:45,956
in some federal penitentiary.

1102
00:46:45,956 --> 00:46:47,738
- They want you, don't dump this on me.

1103
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,996
- Why do you think Daddy
was using your accounts?

1104
00:46:49,996 --> 00:46:52,654
- I don't know, Toni, I don't know shit.

1105
00:46:52,654 --> 00:46:54,723
- Maybe it's because there
were large sums of money

1106
00:46:54,723 --> 00:46:57,688
being passed through them.

1107
00:46:57,688 --> 00:46:59,253
It's a guess.

1108
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:00,939
Listen you were a part
of this whether you want

1109
00:47:00,939 --> 00:47:02,689
to believe it or not.

1110
00:47:03,651 --> 00:47:05,068
- This is insane.

1111
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:10,172
- Ah.

1112
00:47:12,959 --> 00:47:15,459
- Kind of early for that shit.

1113
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:17,490
- Okay, Mom.

1114
00:47:20,293 --> 00:47:21,351
One more.

1115
00:47:21,351 --> 00:47:22,184
One more.

1116
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:34,285
Oh, Gaetano, glad you could make it.

1117
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:35,419
- What am I doing here?

1118
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:38,682
- Hey, you know why they make gold chains?

1119
00:47:38,682 --> 00:47:41,410
To remind you Italians
where to stop shaving.

1120
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,410
(cackling laughter)

1121
00:47:45,314 --> 00:47:46,963
- That's why I drove
all the way down here?

1122
00:47:46,963 --> 00:47:48,154
To listen to this bullshit?

1123
00:47:48,154 --> 00:47:49,466
- No, no, no.

1124
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:50,799
A business deal.

1125
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:53,202
- [Gaetano] Business deal.

1126
00:47:53,202 --> 00:47:56,690
- We want you to come in with us.

1127
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:58,471
- In this joint, like a partner?

1128
00:47:58,471 --> 00:48:01,695
- Oh, uh, this place, and
maybe the Misty Mood, too.

1129
00:48:01,695 --> 00:48:02,528
You know.

1130
00:48:02,528 --> 00:48:03,361
- Oh, yeah.

1131
00:48:03,361 --> 00:48:04,518
You want me to be your partner?

1132
00:48:04,518 --> 00:48:05,424
- Yeah.

1133
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,050
Yeah.
- Well, gee, thanks.

1134
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,383
- Yeah.
- That's really sweet of you.

1135
00:48:08,383 --> 00:48:10,666
- Well, you know, we go back.
- What do you think

1136
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:12,328
I'm fucking stupid?
- What?

1137
00:48:12,328 --> 00:48:14,126
- Toni Albano's got a
piece of this place, no?

1138
00:48:14,126 --> 00:48:17,378
- That was just a loan,
besides, Toni's gone.

1139
00:48:17,378 --> 00:48:19,795
- She's not gone, she's fine.

1140
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,819
- I thought you meant, I
thought you meant her old man.

1141
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,513
- Are you a fucking idiot?

1142
00:48:27,513 --> 00:48:30,169
- Hey, there's a lot of Tonys.

1143
00:48:30,169 --> 00:48:34,167
You, you know why there's
so many Italians named Tony?

1144
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:37,596
Because before they got
on the boat, in Italy,

1145
00:48:37,596 --> 00:48:40,234
their mothers would pin a
little card on their jacket

1146
00:48:40,234 --> 00:48:41,817
that said, "To NY."

1147
00:48:44,813 --> 00:48:45,646
Tony.

1148
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:48,310
Tony.
- That's funny, go ahead,

1149
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:50,279
laugh.
- A fucking comedian.

1150
00:48:50,279 --> 00:48:51,469
(laughter)

1151
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:52,302
(pop)

1152
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:54,104
(thudding)
(groaning)

1153
00:48:54,104 --> 00:48:54,937
Fucking bullshit!

1154
00:48:54,937 --> 00:48:57,948
You fucking disrespect me
again, you motherfucker,

1155
00:48:57,948 --> 00:48:59,036
you disrespect me again,

1156
00:48:59,036 --> 00:49:01,199
you stupid motherfucker.

1157
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:03,261
Piece of fucking shit.

1158
00:49:03,261 --> 00:49:04,839
Shut the fuck up!

1159
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:06,948
You're lucky I don't fucking
kill you, too, you fucking

1160
00:49:06,948 --> 00:49:08,825
piece of shit.

1161
00:49:08,825 --> 00:49:10,501
Bad enough I got to drive
to this shit neighborhood,

1162
00:49:10,501 --> 00:49:12,039
and I've got to listen to your bullshit.

1163
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:13,776
You go to her before me?

1164
00:49:13,776 --> 00:49:17,158
Irish fuck, you disrespect me again,

1165
00:49:17,158 --> 00:49:19,592
I'll fucking kill you.

1166
00:49:19,592 --> 00:49:20,864
And I'll kill you, too,
I'll kill both of you

1167
00:49:20,864 --> 00:49:22,456
motherfuckers, and I'll
put your fucking head

1168
00:49:22,456 --> 00:49:24,723
on my fucking mantels.

1169
00:49:24,723 --> 00:49:26,600
(painful groaning)

1170
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,600
Don't make me come back.

1171
00:49:31,289 --> 00:49:32,122
- I, I.

1172
00:49:34,087 --> 00:49:35,408
Fuck.

1173
00:49:35,408 --> 00:49:36,908
- I'm sorry, Toni.

1174
00:49:38,369 --> 00:49:41,872
You know, being back
here, after all this time,

1175
00:49:41,872 --> 00:49:43,647
is, it's been crazy.

1176
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,814
You know, we haven't fought
like this since mom died.

1177
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:54,576
- You remember when she found that

1178
00:49:54,576 --> 00:49:56,729
pack of butts in my purse?

1179
00:49:56,729 --> 00:50:00,035
- Yeah, I do, and she kicked your ass.

1180
00:50:00,035 --> 00:50:02,618
- I deserved it, I lied to her.

1181
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:04,541
- You did.

1182
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:11,948
You know it's amazing, though,
you look exactly like her.

1183
00:50:16,235 --> 00:50:18,152
Remember that song, um,

1184
00:50:19,069 --> 00:50:21,125
Dad used to sing it to Mom, all the time.

1185
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:23,125
It was like, sweet iris,

1186
00:50:24,035 --> 00:50:26,980
it was Irish.
- My Wild Irish Rose.

1187
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,147
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1188
00:50:31,206 --> 00:50:32,039
- Yeah.

1189
00:50:39,815 --> 00:50:40,648
Toni.

1190
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,170
I've been gone too long.

1191
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:48,074
- Yeah, you have.

1192
00:50:52,553 --> 00:50:54,769
(dramatic music)

1193
00:50:54,769 --> 00:50:57,602
(rumbling engine)

1194
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:09,303
- Hey.

1195
00:51:11,212 --> 00:51:12,252
What are you doing?

1196
00:51:12,252 --> 00:51:13,331
- I'm looking for you.

1197
00:51:13,331 --> 00:51:15,287
They called here twice
looking for Ralph Nunziatta.

1198
00:51:15,287 --> 00:51:16,783
You can't just disappear a guy like that.

1199
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:18,643
- Will you stop your
whining, you work for me now.

1200
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:21,163
He was here, now he's
not here, that's all they

1201
00:51:21,163 --> 00:51:22,246
need to know.

1202
00:51:27,929 --> 00:51:28,762
Ah.

1203
00:51:38,652 --> 00:51:40,819
(pouring)

1204
00:51:46,342 --> 00:51:50,855
- Gaetano's people are
looking for Ralph again.

1205
00:51:50,855 --> 00:51:52,268
I'm not good at this.

1206
00:51:52,268 --> 00:51:53,865
- Bullshit.

1207
00:51:53,865 --> 00:51:55,346
You're a lawyer.

1208
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:59,346
A professional liar, just
do what comes natural.

1209
00:52:01,307 --> 00:52:02,140
- Fuck me.

1210
00:52:03,145 --> 00:52:06,312
(dark, intense music)

1211
00:52:45,761 --> 00:52:46,594
- Michael.

1212
00:52:49,741 --> 00:52:51,074
Where you going?

1213
00:52:54,292 --> 00:52:57,256
Did you, uh, know that
your boyfriend is leaving

1214
00:52:57,256 --> 00:52:58,756
bugs in our house?

1215
00:53:02,169 --> 00:53:04,646
- No, you think that I did that?

1216
00:53:04,646 --> 00:53:07,290
No, I've never seen
that before in my life.

1217
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:10,526
- I watched the home surveillance, stupid.

1218
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:11,979
- So who you working for, Mikey boy?

1219
00:53:11,979 --> 00:53:13,421
Huh?

1220
00:53:13,421 --> 00:53:14,321
Huh?

1221
00:53:14,321 --> 00:53:16,186
The state cops, the feds?

1222
00:53:16,186 --> 00:53:18,686
The attorney general's office?

1223
00:53:19,557 --> 00:53:22,656
- The DEA agents office, they busted me.

1224
00:53:22,656 --> 00:53:24,176
I was moving some stuff for some friends.

1225
00:53:24,176 --> 00:53:25,877
One deal to make lots of money.

1226
00:53:25,877 --> 00:53:26,710
- Stuff?

1227
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:29,812
What kind of fucking stuff,
what are you moving dolls?

1228
00:53:29,812 --> 00:53:31,145
- It was heroin.

1229
00:53:31,997 --> 00:53:34,050
Look, I didn't have a choice.
- Everybody

1230
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,691
has a choice, Michael.

1231
00:53:35,691 --> 00:53:37,833
Did you really think you
were going to waltz in here

1232
00:53:37,833 --> 00:53:40,818
and make us look like fools?

1233
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:42,025
Are you kidding me?

1234
00:53:42,025 --> 00:53:44,582
- All he cares about is his fucking self.

1235
00:53:44,582 --> 00:53:47,156
- I am not like you people.

1236
00:53:47,156 --> 00:53:48,944
I can't go to jail.

1237
00:53:48,944 --> 00:53:50,504
- How long have you been working for them?

1238
00:53:50,504 --> 00:53:52,504
- Yeah, go ahead, tell her.

1239
00:53:52,504 --> 00:53:54,757
- Ah, you fucking prick!

1240
00:53:54,757 --> 00:53:55,590
Heroin?

1241
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:57,851
All this time, pretending you were better

1242
00:53:57,851 --> 00:53:59,684
than me and my family.

1243
00:54:02,225 --> 00:54:04,500
- Fuck you, cheese eating motherfucker.

1244
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,892
- What are you going to do?

1245
00:54:05,892 --> 00:54:07,693
Be sensible.

1246
00:54:07,693 --> 00:54:10,644
The DEA's office knows I'm here.

1247
00:54:10,644 --> 00:54:12,894
You can't kill me.
- Really?

1248
00:54:13,753 --> 00:54:15,170
- Ava, I'm sorry.

1249
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,495
I didn't want this to happen.

1250
00:54:19,495 --> 00:54:20,412
I love you.

1251
00:54:23,003 --> 00:54:25,336
And I'm not like you people.

1252
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:31,455
I'm going to open this door now,

1253
00:54:31,455 --> 00:54:32,788
and I'm leaving.

1254
00:54:38,433 --> 00:54:40,600
(choking)

1255
00:54:44,762 --> 00:54:47,523
(sad music)

1256
00:54:47,523 --> 00:54:49,273
♫ Ah

1257
00:54:51,464 --> 00:54:53,547
♫ Ah, oh

1258
00:54:57,485 --> 00:54:59,235
♫ Ah

1259
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,250
♫ Oh

1260
00:55:24,634 --> 00:55:26,717
- You still need my help?

1261
00:55:27,978 --> 00:55:29,717
- You're free to go.

1262
00:55:29,717 --> 00:55:32,304
But you must go far away.

1263
00:55:32,304 --> 00:55:34,387
I can clean this mess up.

1264
00:55:35,908 --> 00:55:38,519
You should have enough to get started.

1265
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:40,681
And once the smoke clears,
I'll make sure Richard

1266
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:41,931
sends you more.

1267
00:55:44,343 --> 00:55:46,260
- You can come with me.

1268
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,167
- Sorry, I can't.

1269
00:55:50,649 --> 00:55:53,316
(forlorn music)

1270
00:56:19,434 --> 00:56:22,240
- You know, if they're
going to come at us,

1271
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,764
it's going to be real soon.

1272
00:56:24,764 --> 00:56:26,257
We've got to be ready.

1273
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,873
- If you want to leave, I understand.

1274
00:56:28,873 --> 00:56:31,543
If the ship goes down, you
don't have to be on it.

1275
00:56:31,543 --> 00:56:35,624
- Listen, if Gaetano hasn't
restocked all his shit,

1276
00:56:35,624 --> 00:56:37,457
we're as good as dead.

1277
00:56:38,736 --> 00:56:41,069
But I'm not good at running.

1278
00:56:41,992 --> 00:56:44,184
- Me neither, Frankie.

1279
00:56:44,184 --> 00:56:46,684
(rapid thuds)

1280
00:57:20,686 --> 00:57:23,269
(click, click)

1281
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,929
- If you got three guys coming at you,

1282
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:28,937
you aim for the middle one, and all three

1283
00:57:28,937 --> 00:57:30,937
of them go fucking down.

1284
00:57:39,826 --> 00:57:43,222
- Never used to be this complicated.

1285
00:57:43,222 --> 00:57:45,611
Tell somebody to do something, they do it.

1286
00:57:45,611 --> 00:57:49,470
Now a 100 people got to tell
you what they think first.

1287
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,175
Everybody's got an opinion.

1288
00:57:51,175 --> 00:57:53,143
Then the most important voice gets lost,

1289
00:57:53,143 --> 00:57:54,910
and then nothing gets done.

1290
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:56,410
There's no respect

1291
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,170
for the chain of command anymore.

1292
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:07,602
- Frankie.

1293
00:58:07,602 --> 00:58:08,831
- What?
- Did I ever say thank you

1294
00:58:08,831 --> 00:58:09,664
to you?

1295
00:58:09,664 --> 00:58:11,228
Thank you.

1296
00:58:11,228 --> 00:58:13,242
- Toni, you know, you
don't ever have to say

1297
00:58:13,242 --> 00:58:15,126
thank you to me.

1298
00:58:15,126 --> 00:58:17,207
I mean, how many years we been together?

1299
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:18,040
Huh?

1300
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,902
As a family, your father raised me.

1301
00:58:20,902 --> 00:58:24,068
I don't have a mother or a father no more,

1302
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:24,901
it's all you.

1303
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,660
You're my, you're the
only family that I have.

1304
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:28,977
Do you understand?

1305
00:58:28,977 --> 00:58:31,194
You are my sister.

1306
00:58:31,194 --> 00:58:33,010
- My brother, he's MIA anytime he wants,

1307
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,343
and he doesn't call me back.

1308
00:58:36,852 --> 00:58:38,102
And this woman.

1309
00:58:39,792 --> 00:58:42,061
You know, I've got to
type in code and send her

1310
00:58:42,061 --> 00:58:44,511
a little message to setup a face to face

1311
00:58:44,511 --> 00:58:46,502
to straighten out this bullshit.

1312
00:58:46,502 --> 00:58:49,502
I've got to type it in, and send it.

1313
00:58:50,459 --> 00:58:51,924
(cellphone tone)

1314
00:58:51,924 --> 00:58:54,257
- Gaetano's willing to meet.

1315
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:57,583
- That's nice of him.

1316
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:02,372
- 15 years ago, would she be a problem?

1317
00:59:03,323 --> 00:59:05,073
She'd know her place.

1318
00:59:08,126 --> 00:59:09,719
- Remember when we were young?

1319
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:11,747
Where your father used
to say, "Make sure you

1320
00:59:11,747 --> 00:59:13,531
"take care of my daughter.

1321
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:15,137
"Make sure you make sure
nobody goes near her,

1322
00:59:15,137 --> 00:59:16,453
"make sure she's safe."

1323
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:18,570
- You'd always have my back.

1324
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:22,487
- I will protect you till
my dying last breath.

1325
00:59:26,443 --> 00:59:27,938
- It's fucking internet.

1326
00:59:27,938 --> 00:59:29,855
It's a different world.

1327
00:59:32,588 --> 00:59:35,802
That's why I like to have
you around, big fellow.

1328
00:59:35,802 --> 00:59:40,361
You know how to keep your
thoughts to yourself.

1329
00:59:40,361 --> 00:59:41,861
Let's get the car.

1330
00:59:43,675 --> 00:59:46,419
(rumbling hiss of traffic)

1331
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:49,336
(foreboding music)

1332
01:00:01,303 --> 01:00:03,007
Nice spot you picked out here.

1333
01:00:03,007 --> 01:00:05,564
Got two security cameras,
you got some traffic cameras

1334
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:07,116
in the parking lot.

1335
01:00:07,116 --> 01:00:09,605
- And a precinct around the corner.

1336
01:00:09,605 --> 01:00:10,541
- You look good.

1337
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:12,602
I haven't seen you in awhile.

1338
01:00:12,602 --> 01:00:14,185
You know I went to
school with your sister,

1339
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:18,404
but I always had a thing
for you, you know that?

1340
01:00:18,404 --> 01:00:19,659
You see my brother Ralph today?

1341
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:22,823
- Yeah, a few hours ago, he uh,

1342
01:00:22,823 --> 01:00:24,989
he was there with that moron.
- Rizzo.

1343
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:25,870
- Yeah.

1344
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:27,537
Rizzo, big ugly one.

1345
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,857
- So, we're here.

1346
01:00:30,857 --> 01:00:32,475
I just have one question.

1347
01:00:32,475 --> 01:00:34,990
When do you plan on vacating the premises?

1348
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:37,684
- Don Nunziatta I have no
plans to vacate the premises

1349
01:00:37,684 --> 01:00:40,197
until I get some answers.

1350
01:00:40,197 --> 01:00:42,955
- Answers?
- Answers, like, who put

1351
01:00:42,955 --> 01:00:44,705
the hit on my father?

1352
01:00:46,201 --> 01:00:47,451
- I don't know.

1353
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:50,854
- You're such a cocksucker, you know that?

1354
01:00:50,854 --> 01:00:51,936
Of course you know.

1355
01:00:51,936 --> 01:00:52,936
We all know.

1356
01:00:54,398 --> 01:00:59,041
- Sweetheart, why would I
have your father killed?

1357
01:00:59,041 --> 01:01:00,235
I mean, Jesus Christ,
he was the only Albano

1358
01:01:00,235 --> 01:01:02,041
with a sense of humor.

1359
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:06,018
- You couldn't hope to be
half the man my father was.

1360
01:01:06,018 --> 01:01:06,851
- Okay.

1361
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,855
Why don't you ask those
two nitwits that work

1362
01:01:09,855 --> 01:01:13,938
for your family, um,
Pasqual and uh, Joey Apples.

1363
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:17,347
They've been skimming
off you for awhile now.

1364
01:01:17,347 --> 01:01:19,384
Everybody knows it.

1365
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:23,134
In fact, the Albano
family's becoming a joke.

1366
01:01:23,983 --> 01:01:25,516
You're thinking.

1367
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:26,599
Good for you.

1368
01:01:29,556 --> 01:01:32,987
- Between you and me, we both
know who killed my father.

1369
01:01:32,987 --> 01:01:35,317
And you will pay for it.

1370
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:38,503
- You've got some balls,
I'll give you that.

1371
01:01:38,503 --> 01:01:41,362
Unlike your father, I'm not a patient man.

1372
01:01:41,362 --> 01:01:43,937
I don't believe in threats, but,

1373
01:01:43,937 --> 01:01:46,607
I'm going to promise you
that as soon as we're done

1374
01:01:46,607 --> 01:01:48,898
with your beautiful baby sister,

1375
01:01:48,898 --> 01:01:51,231
we're going to start on you.

1376
01:01:53,492 --> 01:01:55,742
- I slit his throat.
- What?

1377
01:01:57,185 --> 01:02:00,574
- I slit your brother's throat.

1378
01:02:00,574 --> 01:02:01,799
- Are you fucking with me right now?

1379
01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:02,632
- Yeah.

1380
01:02:06,249 --> 01:02:08,803
- Get home to your sister.

1381
01:02:08,803 --> 01:02:11,553
She shouldn't be alone right now.

1382
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:18,316
- Bitch.

1383
01:02:18,316 --> 01:02:20,728
- I don't care what she said, find Ralph.

1384
01:02:20,728 --> 01:02:22,972
Jimmy, let's get this done.

1385
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,389
Send it all over.

1386
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:40,711
- Where you going, Mr. Lawyer?

1387
01:02:40,711 --> 01:02:41,927
- Home for a bit.

1388
01:02:41,927 --> 01:02:44,122
Shit, shower, shave, I'll be back.

1389
01:02:44,122 --> 01:02:46,461
- You better watch your ass.

1390
01:02:46,461 --> 01:02:48,197
- I'll be fine.

1391
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:50,614
I'm just a mouthpiece, right?

1392
01:02:56,191 --> 01:02:59,191
(suspenseful music)

1393
01:03:22,957 --> 01:03:26,293
- Why don't you just give them the house?

1394
01:03:26,293 --> 01:03:28,494
- It's not about the house.

1395
01:03:28,494 --> 01:03:32,327
It's about everybody
disrespecting this house.

1396
01:03:33,537 --> 01:03:36,493
- The surveillance has been cut.

1397
01:03:36,493 --> 01:03:39,245
Frankie, take Ava to the boiler room.

1398
01:03:39,245 --> 01:03:43,412
You don't come out of there
unless you hear a knock.

1399
01:03:51,413 --> 01:03:53,597
- Don't move from this room, alright?

1400
01:03:53,597 --> 01:03:55,380
You're going to hear a lot of gunshots,

1401
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,741
it's going to sound like fireworks.

1402
01:03:57,741 --> 01:03:59,566
But don't worry, I'm going
to come back to get you,

1403
01:03:59,566 --> 01:04:01,676
soon as everything stops.

1404
01:04:01,676 --> 01:04:02,781
- Okay.

1405
01:04:02,781 --> 01:04:03,998
- You stay calm.

1406
01:04:03,998 --> 01:04:04,831
Go ahead.

1407
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:09,208
(intense music)

1408
01:04:53,616 --> 01:04:56,533
- Toni, it's been a long time, huh?

1409
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:01,179
(speaks foreign language)

1410
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:07,576
(speaks foreign language)

1411
01:05:07,576 --> 01:05:09,892
I'm sorry about your father.

1412
01:05:09,892 --> 01:05:13,642
(speaks in foreign language)

1413
01:05:22,741 --> 01:05:24,658
(boom)

1414
01:05:28,422 --> 01:05:31,328
(rapid shots)

1415
01:05:31,328 --> 01:05:33,578
(gunshots)

1416
01:05:41,856 --> 01:05:44,023
(gunfire)

1417
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,510
(knocking)

1418
01:06:08,845 --> 01:06:10,762
(boom)

1419
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:15,156
- Hello, little sister.

1420
01:06:16,136 --> 01:06:18,636
(Ava screams)

1421
01:06:37,748 --> 01:06:38,956
Drop that gun, or I kill your sister

1422
01:06:38,956 --> 01:06:40,249
like I killed your father.

1423
01:06:40,249 --> 01:06:41,249
- Not today.

1424
01:06:44,213 --> 01:06:46,130
(shot)

1425
01:06:49,884 --> 01:06:51,801
(boom)

1426
01:06:58,246 --> 01:07:00,413
♫ Ah, ooh

1427
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,384
♫ Ooh

1428
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,877
(Ava cries softly)

1429
01:07:13,486 --> 01:07:14,736
- Listen to me.

1430
01:07:16,619 --> 01:07:19,702
I will settle this mess with Gaetano.

1431
01:07:28,406 --> 01:07:29,239
- Hey, Johnny.

1432
01:07:29,239 --> 01:07:32,223
(speaks foreign language)

1433
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:35,723
(speaks foreign language)

1434
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,672
- Carmine, you're a true cop.

1435
01:07:52,672 --> 01:07:53,608
Always showing up on time

1436
01:07:53,608 --> 01:07:54,873
for dinner.
- Yeah, yeah.

1437
01:07:54,873 --> 01:07:56,794
Well, you know what my
Uncle Eugene always says,

1438
01:07:56,794 --> 01:07:59,878
bad news is easier to swallow with food.

1439
01:07:59,878 --> 01:08:00,711
- Yeah?

1440
01:08:00,711 --> 01:08:01,852
Well, that's good, cause I just ate.

1441
01:08:01,852 --> 01:08:02,685
- Really?

1442
01:08:02,685 --> 01:08:04,569
Well, I'm going to fuck
up your dessert right now.

1443
01:08:04,569 --> 01:08:05,978
Your boy, Larry Rizzo?

1444
01:08:05,978 --> 01:08:07,089
You know Larry Rizzo.

1445
01:08:07,089 --> 01:08:09,574
We found him in the trunk
of your brother's car.

1446
01:08:09,574 --> 01:08:10,762
And somebody shot him
in the back of the head,

1447
01:08:10,762 --> 01:08:12,975
blew off the right side of his face.

1448
01:08:12,975 --> 01:08:13,937
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1449
01:08:13,937 --> 01:08:15,042
- You know DeStephano?

1450
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:17,562
Crazy Horse DeStephano, Sal DeStephano?

1451
01:08:17,562 --> 01:08:19,496
Yeah, well guess what,
he's fucking pushing

1452
01:08:19,496 --> 01:08:21,218
up daisies now, too.

1453
01:08:21,218 --> 01:08:23,304
And I've got two of my
fucking cops in the hospital.

1454
01:08:23,304 --> 01:08:25,291
Two cops with fucking families.

1455
01:08:25,291 --> 01:08:27,495
Homicide wants to talk to your brother.

1456
01:08:27,495 --> 01:08:28,521
- I don't know where he is.

1457
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,354
- You don't know where

1458
01:08:29,354 --> 01:08:30,187
Ralphy boy is?
- I don't know where he is.

1459
01:08:30,187 --> 01:08:31,237
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, listen.

1460
01:08:31,237 --> 01:08:32,794
We're going to find Ralphy boy, see,

1461
01:08:32,794 --> 01:08:34,156
when we find him, we're
going to take care of him,

1462
01:08:34,156 --> 01:08:36,537
and then we're going to take care of you.

1463
01:08:36,537 --> 01:08:38,224
Hey, today's paper?

1464
01:08:38,224 --> 01:08:39,057
You mind?

1465
01:08:40,418 --> 01:08:43,242
My horoscope, I missed my horoscope today.

1466
01:08:43,242 --> 01:08:45,330
"Everything's coming up roses."

1467
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,033
Ain't that fucking beautiful?

1468
01:08:47,033 --> 01:08:48,373
Hey, here you go.

1469
01:08:48,373 --> 01:08:49,602
Have fun with your dessert.

1470
01:08:49,602 --> 01:08:52,185
And have a cannoli for me, huh?

1471
01:08:54,517 --> 01:08:55,593
- Fuck.

1472
01:08:55,593 --> 01:08:56,510
Cocksucker.

1473
01:09:00,552 --> 01:09:01,385
- Oh, oh.

1474
01:09:02,435 --> 01:09:04,352
- Sorry.
- It's alright.

1475
01:09:05,521 --> 01:09:07,287
- We need to talk.

1476
01:09:07,287 --> 01:09:10,484
- What the fuck are you doing here?

1477
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:12,567
- We really need to talk.

1478
01:09:18,389 --> 01:09:20,806
- It's alright, it's alright.

1479
01:09:24,817 --> 01:09:28,961
- The men you sent to
kill the Albanos are dead.

1480
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:30,367
I saw it.

1481
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:31,618
I was there.

1482
01:09:31,618 --> 01:09:32,766
Watched it all from behind the bushes,

1483
01:09:32,766 --> 01:09:34,906
they're all dead.

1484
01:09:34,906 --> 01:09:36,434
- How about those bitches?

1485
01:09:36,434 --> 01:09:37,931
- Maybe you ought to
hear Toni's offer first.

1486
01:09:37,931 --> 01:09:40,101
- Oh, she's got an offer now.

1487
01:09:40,101 --> 01:09:41,678
- Toni killed your brother,

1488
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:42,749
you killed her father,

1489
01:09:42,749 --> 01:09:46,327
that cleans the slate, she wants out.

1490
01:09:46,327 --> 01:09:48,157
One million dollars.

1491
01:09:48,157 --> 01:09:50,817
Call it, uh, an exit tax.

1492
01:09:50,817 --> 01:09:52,527
Toni and Ava walk, leave the country,

1493
01:09:52,527 --> 01:09:54,411
never to be heard from again.

1494
01:09:54,411 --> 01:09:55,763
You get it all, they get your assurance

1495
01:09:55,763 --> 01:09:58,013
that you won't hunt them down.

1496
01:09:58,013 --> 01:10:00,536
- And how do they know
I'm going to keep my word?

1497
01:10:00,536 --> 01:10:02,264
- If something happens to
them, I have instructions

1498
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:06,896
to mail a package to the
attorney general's office.

1499
01:10:06,896 --> 01:10:10,557
500 thousand now, the other half tonight.

1500
01:10:10,557 --> 01:10:12,424
Look me up at Pisano's
restaurant, we meet in public,

1501
01:10:12,424 --> 01:10:13,507
seven thirty.

1502
01:10:18,338 --> 01:10:20,755
You know it's the smart play.

1503
01:10:22,923 --> 01:10:25,173
- Get the fuck out of here.

1504
01:10:30,058 --> 01:10:32,045
- Well, it's all set with the bartender.

1505
01:10:32,045 --> 01:10:33,795
Don't worry about it.

1506
01:10:42,324 --> 01:10:45,157
You know why the cops
call it organized crime?

1507
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:46,834
- [Gaetano] I got fucked up.

1508
01:10:46,834 --> 01:10:48,278
- Again.

1509
01:10:48,278 --> 01:10:51,053
- Again, I got fucked up again.

1510
01:10:51,053 --> 01:10:53,309
- Very sloppy, very messy.

1511
01:10:53,309 --> 01:10:55,551
- Just tell everybody that I
got it under control, okay?

1512
01:10:55,551 --> 01:10:57,202
I've got it handled.
- How?

1513
01:10:57,202 --> 01:11:00,806
You going to let her kill
some more of your boys?

1514
01:11:00,806 --> 01:11:03,251
- I'm going to make a
financial arrangement.

1515
01:11:03,251 --> 01:11:05,297
She's going to walk,
she's going to disappear.

1516
01:11:05,297 --> 01:11:06,736
- Well, you're not going
to walk without kicking

1517
01:11:06,736 --> 01:11:08,319
something in to us.

1518
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:12,705
- What do you want?

1519
01:11:12,705 --> 01:11:14,624
- We're going to take the Albano business,

1520
01:11:14,624 --> 01:11:16,707
and divide it up equally.

1521
01:11:17,584 --> 01:11:18,692
- What do I get?

1522
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:20,297
- What do you get?

1523
01:11:20,297 --> 01:11:23,151
You get to keep breathing,
that's what you get.

1524
01:11:23,151 --> 01:11:25,651
Now, get the fuck out of here.

1525
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:33,738
Fucking punk.

1526
01:11:36,608 --> 01:11:39,358
(hum of traffic)

1527
01:11:41,682 --> 01:11:43,537
- Hey, how you doing, sexy?

1528
01:11:43,537 --> 01:11:44,735
- [Bartender] Hey.

1529
01:11:44,735 --> 01:11:46,179
- Things good?

1530
01:11:46,179 --> 01:11:47,422
- Things are good.

1531
01:11:47,422 --> 01:11:48,881
- Good, good, good.
- How about you?

1532
01:11:48,881 --> 01:11:49,797
You look good.

1533
01:11:49,797 --> 01:11:52,008
- Ah, man, I'm feeling much better now.

1534
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:54,557
Everything seems to have
worked out for the best so far.

1535
01:11:54,557 --> 01:11:56,491
Have uh, you seen my friend Joey around?

1536
01:11:56,491 --> 01:11:57,324
- [Bartender] Yep.

1537
01:11:57,324 --> 01:11:58,157
- [Pasqual] He left me something?

1538
01:11:58,157 --> 01:11:58,990
- Yep.

1539
01:11:58,990 --> 01:11:59,823
This is for you.

1540
01:11:59,823 --> 01:12:00,656
- That's great.

1541
01:12:00,656 --> 01:12:02,366
Thank you, thank you very much.

1542
01:12:02,366 --> 01:12:04,236
How about a kiss?

1543
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:05,397
- [Bartender] Always for you.

1544
01:12:05,397 --> 01:12:07,051
- Am I going to see you
again later tonight?

1545
01:12:07,051 --> 01:12:08,981
- Of course, the usual place.

1546
01:12:08,981 --> 01:12:10,398
- Alright, great.

1547
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:14,704
I've got to run to the
bathroom, I'll be right back.

1548
01:12:14,704 --> 01:12:17,287
- I'll freshen this up for you.

1549
01:12:18,828 --> 01:12:21,411
(dreary music)

1550
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:42,984
(boom)

1551
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:54,026
- Hey, Joey, have a great night, man.

1552
01:12:54,026 --> 01:12:55,804
- Take it easy, I don't like gelato.

1553
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:57,029
How about you girls beat it?

1554
01:12:57,029 --> 01:12:58,731
I got some business to
take care of, but I'll be

1555
01:12:58,731 --> 01:13:00,148
calling you soon.

1556
01:13:14,511 --> 01:13:16,344
(pop)

1557
01:13:22,962 --> 01:13:26,129
(heavy, gloomy music)

1558
01:13:38,755 --> 01:13:41,672
(foreboding music)

1559
01:13:49,851 --> 01:13:51,601
♫ Ah

1560
01:13:56,341 --> 01:13:58,091
♫ Ah

1561
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:03,156
♫ Oh, oh, oh

1562
01:14:03,156 --> 01:14:05,239
♫ Oh, oh

1563
01:14:07,809 --> 01:14:08,642
(shots)

1564
01:14:08,642 --> 01:14:10,667
(shots)

1565
01:14:10,667 --> 01:14:12,972
(rapid shots)

1566
01:14:12,972 --> 01:14:14,221
♫ Oh, ah

1567
01:14:14,221 --> 01:14:16,638
♫ Oh, ah, oh

1568
01:14:18,303 --> 01:14:20,053
♫ Oh

1569
01:14:22,101 --> 01:14:24,184
♫ Ah, oh

1570
01:14:25,479 --> 01:14:27,229
♫ Oh

1571
01:14:28,731 --> 01:14:30,814
♫ Ah, oh

1572
01:14:34,353 --> 01:14:35,908
- This is a fucking waste of time.

1573
01:14:35,908 --> 01:14:38,250
She was on her way back
to the other side by now.

1574
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:39,083
- Maybe?

1575
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:39,916
- It's either that, or
we're going to find them

1576
01:14:39,916 --> 01:14:41,113
floating in Sheep Head's
Bay, you know what

1577
01:14:41,113 --> 01:14:41,946
I'm talking about?

1578
01:14:41,946 --> 01:14:42,779
- I hear you.

1579
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:43,612
At least Christmas is coming,

1580
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:44,445
get a little overtime out

1581
01:14:44,445 --> 01:14:45,566
- of this.
- Oh, a little overtime

1582
01:14:45,566 --> 01:14:46,483
