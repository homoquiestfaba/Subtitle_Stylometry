PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN
English subtitlez by tHe.b0dY

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Drink up me 'earties yo ho!

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,200
We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot.

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,800
Drink up me 'earties yo ho!

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,500
Yo ho yo ho a pirate's life for me.

6
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,900
We extort, we pilfer, we filch and sack.
Drink up 

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,300
Quiet, missy,
cursed pirates sail these waters.

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,900
You dont want to bring them
down on us now, do ya?

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,900
Mr. Gibbs that will do!
- She was singing about pirates.

10
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,400
Bad luck to be singing about pirates with us
mired in this unnatural fog. Mark my words.

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,300
Consider them marked.

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,200
On your way.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,000
Aye, Lieutenant.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,400
Its bad luck to have a woman on board, too,

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,400
even a miniature one.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,800
I think itd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,900
Think again, Miss Swann.

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,900
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of them.

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,900
I intend to see to that any man who sails
under a pirate flag or...

20
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,700
...wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,100
A short drop and a sudden stop. 

22
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,800
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervor.

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,700
But Im…Im concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter.

24
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,900
My apologies, Governor Swann.

25
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,900
- Actually, I find it all fascinating.
- Yes, thats what concerns me.

26
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,200
Look, a boy!
Theres a boy in the water!

27
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,800
Man overboard!

28
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,100
Haul him aboard!

29
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,200
Hes still breathing.

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,100
Mary, Mother of God!

31
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,300
What happened here?

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,200
Its most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,400
A lot of good it did them.

34
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,800
Everyones thinking it.
Im just saying it...

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,700
Piratas!
- Theres no proof of that.

36
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,100
It was probably an accident.

37
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,900
Rouse the Captain immediately! .
- Hay, sir.

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Heave to and take in sail,
launch the boats.

39
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,700
Elizabeth I want you to accompany the boy.
Hell be in your charge.

40
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,600
Take care of him.

41
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,100
Its ok.

42
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,500
My names Elizabeth Swann.

43
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,900
Will Turner.

44
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,300
Im watching over you, Will.

45
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,200
- Youre a pirate!
- Has he said anything?

46
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,000
His name is William Turner,
thats all I found out.

47
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,900
Take him below.

48
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Elizabeth!

49
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,000
Are you alright? 

50
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,300
Are you decent?
- Yes, yes!

51
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,300
Still abed at this hour?
Its a beautiful day.

52
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,800
I have a gift for you.

53
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,600
- Oh, its beautiful!
- Isnt it?.

54
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,900
May I inquire as to the occasion?.

55
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,900
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

56
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,100
Go on.

57
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,500
Actually, I, uh...

58
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,900
I had hoped you might wear
it for the ceremony today.

59
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,900
The ceremony?

60
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,900
Captain Norringtons
promotion ceremony.

61
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,700
I knew it!

62
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,200
Commodore Norrington
hes about to become.

63
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,900
Fine gentleman, dont you think.
He fancies you?

64
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Elizabeth?
Hows it coming?

65
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,600
Its difficult to say.

66
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,300
Im told its the latest
fashion in London.

67
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,900
Well, women in London mustve
learned not to breathe.

68
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,200
My lord, you have a visitor.

69
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,900
Ah, Mr. Turner,
good to see you again.

70
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Good day, sir.

71
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,300
I have your order.

72
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,900
The blade is folded steel, thats gold
filigree laid into the handle.

73
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,300
If I may?

74
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Perfectly balanced. The tang is
nearly the full width of the blade.

75
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Impressive, very impressive.

76
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,600
Ah, now, Commodore Norrington is
going to be very pleased with this.

77
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,900
Do pass my compliments
on to your Master.

78
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,800
I shall. 

79
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,100
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

80
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,900
- Ah, Elizabeth, you look absolutely stunning.
- Will.

81
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,800
So good to see you!

82
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,100
- I had a dream about you last night.
- About me?

83
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,500
Elizabeth, is that entirely
proper for you to...?

84
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,200
About the day we met,
do you remember?

85
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

86
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Will, how many times must 
I ask you to call me Elizabeth?

87
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,600
At least once more,
Miss Swann, as always.

88
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,900
There, see.

89
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,500
At least the boy has
a sense of propriety.

90
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,900
Now, we really must be going.
Farewell.

91
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,700
Good day, Mr. Turner.

92
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,600
Come along.

93
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,900
Good day...

94
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,300
...Elizabeth.

95
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,600
What?

96
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,200
Hold up there, you.

97
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,500
Its a shilling to tie up your
boat at the dock.

98
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
And I shall need to
know your name.

99
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,600
What dye say to three shillings
and we forget the name?

100
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,300
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

101
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,100
Two paces front!

102
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,700
Right about turn!

103
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
Present...

104
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,000
...arms!

105
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,300
This dock is off limits to civilians.

106
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,200
Im terribly sorry, I didnt know.
If I see one...

107
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
...I shall inform you immediately.

108
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,900
Apparently theres some sort of a high toned
and fancy to do up at the fort, eh?

109
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:54,700
How could it be that two upstanding gentlemen
such as yourselves did not merit an invitation?

110
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,100
Someone has to make sure this
dock stays off limits to civilians.

111
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,100
Its a fine goal to be sure but
it seems to me that a...

112
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,400
a ship like that makes this one
here a bit superfluous, really.

113
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,000
Ah, the Dauntless is the power in these waters,
true enough, but theres no ship... 

114
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,900
...that can match the
Interceptor for speed.

115
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,900
Ive heard of one, supposed to be
very fast, nigh un-catchable...

116
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,700
"The Black Pearl"

117
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,000
Well…theres no real ship that
can match the Interceptor.

118
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,300
- The Black Pearl is a real ship.
- No, no its not.

119
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,000
- Yes, it is, Ive seen it.
- Youve seen it?

120
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,200
- Yes.
- You havent seen it.

121
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Yes, I have.

122
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Youve seen a ship with black sails...

123
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,900
...thats crewed by the damned and
captained by a man so evil...

124
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,900
...that Hell itself spat him back?
- Ne.

125
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,300
Ne.

126
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,700
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

127
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,700
Oh, and no ship thats not crewed by
the damned and captained by a man so evil...

128
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
...that Hell itself spat him
back out could possibly...

129
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,900
...have black sails therefore couldnt
possibly be any other ...

130
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,200
...ship than the Black Pearl.
Is that what you're saying?

131
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,900
Ne.

132
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,900
Like I said… theres no real ship
that can match the Interceptor

133
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,200
Hey!

134
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,200
You!

135
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,900
Get away from there!
You dont have permission to be aboard there, mate.

136
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,900
Im sorry, its just its such
a pretty boat  ship!

137
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,600
- Whats your name?
- Smith or...Smithy, if you like.

138
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,200
Whats your purpose in
Port Royal, Mr. Smith?

139
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,900
Yeah, and no lies!

140
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,500
Well, then, I confess, it is my intention
to commandeer one of these ships.

141
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Pick up a crew in Tortuga,  raid, pillage, plunder
and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out.

142
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,100
I said no lies.

143
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,300
I think hes telling the truth.

144
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,900
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldnt have told us.

145
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,900
Unless, of course, he knew you wouldnt
believe the truth even if he told it to you.

146
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
May I have a moment?

147
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,800
You look lovely, Elizabeth.
- Yes?

148
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:31,200
I apologize if I seem forward but I...
must speak my mind

149
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,300
This promotion throws into sharp
relief that which I have... 

150
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,500
...not yet achieved.
A marriage to a fine woman.

151
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,200
You have become a fine
woman, Elizabeth.

152
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,900
I cant breathe.

153
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,100
Yes, Im a bit nervous myself.

154
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,500
...and then they made me their chief.

155
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,900
Elizabeth?

156
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,900
Elizabeth!

157
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,900
The rocks!
Sir, its a miracle she missed them!

158
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,300
- Will you be saving her then?
- I cant swim.

159
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,800
Pearl of the Kings Navy you are.

160
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,300
Do not lose these.

161
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,800
What was that?

162
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
I got her.

163
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,300
- Not breathing.
- Move!

164
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,300
Never would have thought of that.

165
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,800
Clearly youve never been to Singapore.

166
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Where did you get that?

167
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,300
On your feet.

168
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,800
Elizabeth.

169
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,800
- Are you alright?
- Yes, Im fine.

170
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,300
- Shoot him!
- Father!

171
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,800
Commodore, do you really
intend to kill my rescuer?

172
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,800
I believe thanks are in order.

173
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,800
Had a brush with the East India
Trading company, did we?

174
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Pirate?

175
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,800
- Hang him.

176
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

177
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,800
- Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isnt it?
- Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please, sir.

178
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,800
- Well, I dont see your ship...Captain.
- Im in the market as it were.

179
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,300
- He said hed come to commandeer one.
- Told ya he was telling the truth. 

180
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,800
These are his, sir.

181
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,300
No additional shots nor powder...

182
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,300
A compass that doesnt point north...

183
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,300
And I half expected it
to be made of wood.

184
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,800
You are, without doubt, the worst
pirate Ive ever heard of.

185
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,800
But you have heard of me.

186
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Commodore, I really must protest.

187
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Carefully Lieutenant.

188
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,300
Pirate or not this man saved my life.

189
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,100
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness.

190
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,600
Though it seems enough
to condemn him.

191
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,300
Indeed.

192
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,300
Finally.

193
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
No, dont shoot!

194
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I knew youd warm up to me.
Commodore Norrington, my effects, please... 

195
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,600
...and my hat.

196
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,600
Commodore!

197
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,300
- Elizabeth, it is Elizabeth isnt it?
- Its Miss Swann.

198
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,300
Miss Swann, if youd be so kind.
Come, come, dear, we dont have all day.

199
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Now if youd be very kind..

200
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,300
Easy on the goods, darling.

201
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,800
Youre despicable.

202
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Sticks and stones, love. I saved your
life, you saved mine, were square.

203
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,800
Gentlemen, mlady.

204
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,000
you will always remember this as
the day that you almost caught...

205
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,300
...Capitan Jack Sparrow.

206
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,600
- Now, will you shoot him?
- Open fire!

207
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,000
On his heels!

208
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows...

209
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,000
...I would hate for him to miss it.

210
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,300
Right where I left you.

211
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,300
Not where I left you.

212
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
You're the one they're hunting.

213
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,300
The pirate.

214
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,800
Ah. Well, then it would be a shame to
put a black mark on your record.

215
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,300
So, if you'll excuse me...

216
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,500
Do you think this wise, boy... 

217
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,800
...crossing blades with a pirate?

218
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,800
You threatened Miss Swann.

219
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,300
Only a little.

220
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,800
You know what youre doing,
Ill give you that. Excellent form...

221
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,800
...but hows your footwork?

222
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,800
If I step here...
Very good.

223
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,200
Now I step again.

224
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,600
Ta.

225
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,400
That is a wonderful trick.

226
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,800
Except once again you are
between me and my way out.

227
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,200
And now you have no weapon.

228
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,800
Who makes all these?

229
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,800
I do!
And I practice with them...

230
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,800
...three hours a day!

231
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,500
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

232
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,900
Or, perhaps the reason you practice three
hours a day is that you already found one ...

233
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,900
...and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

234
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,200
You're not a eunuch, are you?

235
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,800
I practice three hours a day,
so that when I meet a pirate...

236
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,300
...I can kill it.

237
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,200
You cheated.

238
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,700
Pirate.

239
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
- Move away.
- No.

240
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,800
- Please, move.
- No!

241
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

242
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,200
This shot is not meant for you.

243
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,800
Move in!

244
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,300
Excellent work, Mr. Brown . Youve assisted
in the capture of a dangerous fugitive.

245
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,900
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

246
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,500
Well, I trust youll always remember
this as the day that Captain...

247
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,800
...Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

248
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Take him away!

249
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,500
- Can you smell it.

250
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,600
- Nice juicy bone.
- Come here, boy.

251
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You can keep doing that forever,
the dog is never going to move.

252
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,300
Oh, excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet.

253
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,800
- Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
- No, she hasnt.

254
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,600
Well, she has had a very trying day.

255
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,900
Ghastly weather, dont you think?

256
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,100
Bleak, very bleak.

257
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,800
Whats that?

258
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,100
Cannon fire!

259
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,100
Return fire!

260
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,300
I know those guns.

261
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,700
- Its the Pearl.
- Black Pearl?

262
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Ive heard stories. Shes been preying on
ships and settlements for near ten years.

263
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,100
- Never leaves any survivors.
- No survivors?

264
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,600
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

265
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,000
Goveror.

266
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,700
Barricade yourself in my office.

267
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,000
Thats an order!

268
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,500
Don`t...

269
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,300
Hello, chump.

270
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,600
Girl.

271
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,900
SMiss Swann, theyve come to kidnap you.

272
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,600
- What?
- Youre the Governors daughter.

273
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,400
They havent seen you. Hide and the
first chance you get, run to the fort.

274
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,800
Gotcha!

275
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,800
- Its hot! Its on me!
-Come on.

276
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,100
We know youre here, Poppet.

277
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,400
Poppet.

278
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,200
Come out.

279
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
We promise we wont hurt you.

280
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,300
We will find you, Poppet.

281
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,400
Youve got something of
ours and it calls to us.

282
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
The Gold calls to us...

283
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Gold, gold.

284
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,700
Hello, Poppet.

285
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,500
- Parley
- What?

286
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,000
Parley. I invoke the right of parley.

287
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,900
According to the code of the brethren, set down
by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew...

288
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
...you have to take me to your Captain.

289
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
I know the code.

290
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,800
If an adversary demands parley you
can do them no harm until ...

291
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,000
...the parley is complete.

292
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,500
To blazes with the code.

293
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,600
She wants to be taken to the Captain.

294
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:39,300
And shell go without a fuss.
We must honor the code.

295
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,800
Say goodbye!

296
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,000
Goodbye.

297
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,400
- Come on!
- Elizabeth.

298
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,400
Outta my way, scum!

299
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,500
My sympathies friend, youve
no manner of luck at all.

300
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,100
Come on, doggy.

301
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,300
Its just you and me now.
Its you and ol Jack.

302
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,800
Come on. Come on.

303
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,700
Good boy. Thats it.
Good boy, come on.

304
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,900
Bit closer, bit closer.

305
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Thats it, thats it, doggy.

306
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,600
Come on you filthy, slimy, mangy cad.

307
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,100
No, no, no, no, no,
I didnt mean it. I didnt.

308
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,200
This aint the armory.

309
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,800
Well, well, well,
look what we have here Twigg?

310
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,900
Capitain Jack Sparrow.

311
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,700
Last time I saw you, you were all
alone on a godforsaken island.

312
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Shrinking into the distance.
His fortunes arent improved much.

313
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,000
Worry about your own
fortunes, gentlemen.

314
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,200
The deepest circle of Hell is reserved
for betrayers and mutineers.

315
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,500
So there is a curse.

316
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
That's interestin.

317
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,000
You know nothing of Hell.

318
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,600
Thats very interesting.

319
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,900
I didnt know we were
takin on captives.

320
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,900
Shes invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

321
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,600
- I am here to negotiate...
- You will speak when spoken to.

322
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,900
And yell not lay a hand on those
under the protection of parley.

323
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,400
Aye, sir.

324
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
My apologies, Miss.

325
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Captain Barbossa, I am here to negotiate
the cessation of hostilities l ...

326
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,900
...against Port Royal.

327
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,400
There are a lot of long words in there, Miss,
were naught but humble pirates.

328
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,700
- What is it that you want?
- I want you to leave and never come back.

329
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
Im disinclined to acquiesce to your request...

330
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,300
...means no.

331
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,200
Very well. 

332
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,500
I'll drop it.

333
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,500
Me holds are burstin' with swag and
that bit of shine matters to us?

334
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,300
- Why?
- Its what youve been searching for.

335
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,100
I recognized the ship. I saw it eight years
ago on the crossing from England.

336
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,800
Did ya now?

337
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,500
Fine.

338
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Well, I suppose if it is worthless then
theres no point in me keeping it.

339
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,700
You have a name, Missy?

340
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,200
Elizabeth... Turner

341
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,600
Im a maid in the
Governors household.

342
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
Miss Turner.

343
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,500
Bootstrap.

344
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,500
And how does a maid come to
own a trinket such as that?

345
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,900
Family heirloom, perhaps?

346
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,200
I didnt steal it if thats what you mean.

347
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,200
Very well, you hand it over and well put your
town to our rudder and never return.

348
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,900
Our bargain?

349
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,300
Still the guns and stowem, ...The men.

350
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,100
Wait! You have to take me to shore.
According to the code of the order of the brethren...

351
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:30,000
First, your return to shore was
not part of our negotiations...

352
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,300
...nor our agreement so
I must do nothing.

353
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,300
And secondly, you must be a pirate for
the pirates code to apply and youre not

354
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:41,700
And thirdly, the code is more what you'd
call "guidelines" than actual rules.

355
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,400
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

356
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,500
Theyve taken her.
Theyve taken Elizabeth.

357
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,400
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

358
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,500
We have to hunt them down,
we must save her.

359
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,400
And where do you propose we start?

360
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,000
If you have any information concerning
my daughter, please, share it.

361
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,600
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.

362
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,000
Mentioned it, is more what he did.

363
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,300
Ask him where it is.

364
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,600
Make a deal with him
he could lead us to it.

365
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,400
No...

366
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,500
the pirates who invaded this Fort left
Sparrow locked in his cell ergo....

367
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,700
...they are not his allies.

368
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,500
Governor, we will establish
their most likely course...

369
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,600
Thats not good enough!

370
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Mr. Turner, you are not a military
man, you are not a sailor.

371
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,900
You are a blacksmith and this is
not the moment for rash actions.

372
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,300
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you are the only man here...

373
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,800
...who cares for Elizabeth.

374
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,500
You!

375
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,200
- Sparrow.
- Aye.

376
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,400
You are familiar with that ship,
the Black Pearl?

377
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,800
- Ive heard of it.
- Where does it make berth?

378
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,400
Where does it make berth?
Have you not heard the stories?

379
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,100
Captain Barbossa and his crew of miscreants
sailed from the dreaded Isla de Muerta.

380
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:42,100
Its an island that cannot be found except
by those who already know where it is.

381
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,900
The ships real enough.

382
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,700
Therefore its anchorage must be
a real place. Where is it?

383
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,900
- Why ask me?
- Because youre a pirate.

384
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,500
And you want to turn pirate
yourself, is that it?

385
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,000
Never.

386
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,100
- They took Miss Swann .
- Oh, so it is that youve found a girl.

387
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,300
I see.

388
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:13,000
Well, if youre intending to brave all, hasten
to her rescue and so win fair ladys heart...

389
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
...youll have to do it alone, mate.
I see no profit in it for me.

390
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,300
- I can get you out of here.
- Hows that? The keys run off.

391
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,000
I helped build these cells.
These are half pin-barrel hinges.

392
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,600
With the right leverage and
a proper application of strength...

393
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,500
...the door will lift free.

394
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,300
- Whats your name?
- Will Turner.

395
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
That will be short for William,
I imagine.

396
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,700
Good, strong name. No doubt,
named for your father, aye.

397
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,900
Yes.

398
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,200
Aha. Well, Mr. Turner,
Ive changed me mind.

399
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,800
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear on pain of death...

400
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,800
...I shall take you to the Black
Pearl and your bonny lass?

401
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,800
- Do we have an accord?

402
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,200
- Agreed.
- Agreed, get me out.

403
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,500
Hurry, someone will
have heard that.

404
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,300
Not without my effects.

405
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,400
Were going to steal a ship?

406
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,600
That ship?

407
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Commandeer.
Were going to commandeer that ship.

408
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,900
Nautical term.

409
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,700
 One question about your business boy,
or theres no use going.

410
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,400
This girl, how far are you
willing to go to save her?

411
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,000
- Id die for her.
- Oh, good.

412
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,700
No worries, then.

413
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,000
This is either madness or brilliance.

414
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,100
Its remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

415
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:46,500
Everyone stay calm,
we are taking over the ship.

416
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,700
Aye, avast!

417
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,900
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.

418
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,500
You'll never make it out of the bay.

419
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:58,800
Son.

420
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,600
Im Captain Jack Sparrow, savvy?

421
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,300
Commodore!

422
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:12,300
Sir, theyve taken the Dauntless!

423
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,100
Theyve taken the ship.

424
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,800
Sparrow and Turner,
they've taken the Dauntless!

425
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,700
Rash, Turner, too rash.

426
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,000
He is without doubt the worst
pirate I have ever seen.

427
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,600
Here they come.

428
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,700
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

429
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,900
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

430
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,300
Sailors, back to the Interceptor! Now!

431
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,700
Thank you, Commodore, for
getting us ready to make way.

432
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,400
Wed have a hard time
of it by ourselves.

433
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,800
Set top sails and clear up this mess.

434
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,400
With the wind a quarter astern,
we wont catch them.

435
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,900
We dont need to catch them just
get them in range of the long nines.

436
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,000
Men, come about.
Run out the guns.

437
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,100
We open fire on our own ship, sir?

438
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,100
Id rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

439
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,900
Commodore, hes disabled
the rudder chain, sir.

440
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,200
Abandon ship!

441
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,800
Thats got to be the best
pirate Ive ever seen.

442
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,900
So it would seem.

443
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,700
When I was a lad living in England,
my mother raised me by herself.

444
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:21,900
After she died, I came out here,
looking for my father.

445
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,300
Is that so?

446
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,500
My father, Will Turner.

447
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,200
And in jail it was only after you learned
my name that you agreed to help.

448
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,500
Since thats what I wanted,
I didnt press the matter.

449
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,200
Im not a simpleton, Jack.
You knew my father.

450
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,500
I knew im.

451
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,600
Probably one the few who knew
him as William Turner.

452
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,100
Everyone else just called him
Bootstrap or Bootstrap Bill.

453
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:56,100
- Bootstrap?
- Good man, good pirate.

454
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,900
- I swear you look just like him.
- Its not true.

455
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,900
He was a merchant sailor, a good,
respectable man who obeyed the law.

456
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,700
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

457
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,700
My father was not a pirate.

458
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,400
Put it away, son.

459
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,900
Its not worth you getting beat again.

460
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,300
You didnt beat me.

461
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,300
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight. Id killed you.

462
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,100
And thats no incentive for
me to fight fair, is it?

463
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,200
Now as long as youre just
hanging there, pay attention.

464
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,900
The only rules that really
matter are these:

465
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,600
What a man can do and
what a man cant do.

466
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,400
For instance you can accept that your
father was a pirate and a good man ...

467
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,600
...or you cant.

468
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,800
But pirate is in your blood, boy, so youll
have to square with that someday.

469
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,800
And me, for example,
I can let you drown.

470
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,900
But I cant bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies, savvy?

471
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,700
So...

472
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,300
Can you sail under the
command of a pirate...

473
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,900
...or can you not?

474
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,600
Tortuga?

475
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,600
Tortuga.

476
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,600
...feel unwanted.

477
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,600
Not sure I deserved that.

478
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,000
Giselle!

479
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,400
Who was she?

480
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,200
What?

481
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,800
I may have deserved that.

482
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,300
Curse you for breathing,
you slack jawed idiot!

483
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,300
Mothers love!

484
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,800
Jack!

485
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,500
You should know better then to wake
a man when hes sleeping.

486
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,800
- Is bad luck
- Ah, fortunately I know how to counter it.

487
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,000
The man who did the waking buys,
the man who was sleeping, a drink.

488
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,800
The man who was sleeping drinks it
while listening to a proposition...

489
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
... from the man who did the waking.

490
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,000
Aye, that'll about do it.

491
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,600
Blast! Im already awake!

492
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,900
That was for the smell.

493
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,200
Keep a sharp eye!

494
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,900
Now, whats the nature of
this venture you are in?

495
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,400
Im going after the Black Pearl.

496
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,700
I know where its going to be
and Im going to take it.

497
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,700
Jack, its a fools errand.

498
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,700
Well, you know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl?

499
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,200
Thats why I know what
Barbossa is up to...

500
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,300
...all I need is a crew.

501
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,900
From what I hear tell of Captain Barbossa, hes not
a man to suffer fools nor strike a bargain with one.

502
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,100
Well, then I say its a very good
thing Im not a fool then, aye.

503
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,200
Prove me wrong. What makes ye think
Brabossa will give up his ship to you?

504
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,600
Let’s just say it’s a matter of leverage, aye?

505
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,900
The kid?

506
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,600
That is the child of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

507
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,000
His only child, savvy?

508
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,100
Is he now?

509
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,300
Leverage says you...

510
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:57,300
...I think I feel a change in the wind says I.
I’ll find us a crew...

511
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,300
...there’s bound to be some sailors
on this rock crazy as you.

512
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,400
One can only hope.
Take what you can...

513
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,900
Give nothing back

514
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,800
You'll be dinin' with the captain.
And he requests you wear this.

515
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,600
Well, you may tell the captain that I am
disinclined to acquiesce to his request.

516
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,100
He said you’d say that.

517
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,400
He also said if that be the case...

518
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,300
...you'll be dinin' with the crew...

519
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,300
...and you'll be naked

520
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,200
Fine.

521
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,900
There’s no need to stand on ceremony,
nor call to impress anyone.

522
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,200
You must be hungry.

523
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Try the wine.

524
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,200
And the apples.
One of those next.

525
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,100
It’s poisoned.

526
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,900
There would be no sense to
be killing you Miss Turner. 

527
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,900
Then release me, you have your trinket.
I’m of no further value to you.

528
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:12,300
- You don’t know what this is, do you?
- It’s a pirate medallion.

529
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,300
This is Aztec gold.

530
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:22,100
One of 882 identical pieces they delivered
in a stone chest to Cortés himself.

531
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,700
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

532
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,900
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

533
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,700
So the heathen gods placed upon
the gold…a terrible curse.

534
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:44,300
Any mortal that removes but
a piece from that stone chest...

535
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,300
...shall be punished for eternity.

536
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,800
I hardly believe in ghost stories
anymore, Captain Barbossa.

537
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,800
Aye.

538
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,700
That’s exactly what I thought when
we were first told the tale.

539
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,700
Buried on an island that
cannot be found except...

540
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,300
...for those who know where it is.

541
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,100
Find it, we did.
There be the chest...

542
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:13,100
...inside be the gold.

543
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,100
We took them all!

544
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:17,600
Spent them and traded them.

545
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,800
We frittered them away...on drink
and food and pleasurable company.

546
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:26,700
The more we gave them away,
the more we came to realize...

547
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:35,400
...the drink would not satisfy,
food turned to ash in our mouths...

548
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,400
...and all the pleasurable company in
the world could not slake our lust.

549
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,700
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

550
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:54,300
Compelled by greed we were,
and now we are consumed by it.

551
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,900
There is one way we
can end our curse.

552
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:14,200
All the scattered pieces of the
Aztec gold must be restored...

553
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,900
...and the blood repaid.

554
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,800
Thanks to you we have the final piece.

555
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,100
And the blood to be repaid?

556
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,700
That’s why there’s no sense
to be killing you...

557
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,300
Yet!

558
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Apple?

559
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,900
I’m curious, after killing me what was
it you planning on doing next?

560
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,400
Look!

561
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,800
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

562
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:09,300
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

563
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,200
But neither are we dead.

564
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,800
For too long I’ve been parched with
thirst and unable to quench it.

565
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Too long I’ve been starving
to death and haven’t died.

566
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:27,800
I feel nothing, not the wind on my
face nor the spray of the sea.

567
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,900
Nor the warmth of a woman’s flesh.

568
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,600
You best start believing in
ghost stories Miss Turner...

569
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,900
You’re in one!

570
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,600
What are ye looking at?
Back to work!

571
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,500
Feast your eyes, Captain.

572
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,300
All of them, faithful hands before the mast.

573
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,900
Every man worth his salt.

574
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,400
And crazy to boot.

575
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,900
So this is your able-bodied crew?

576
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,400
- You, sailor! - Cotton, Sir.
- Mr.Cotton!

577
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:34,100
Do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and
stay true in the face of danger and almost certain death?

578
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,800
- Mr. Cotton! Answer me!

579
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,400
He's a mute, sir. Poor devil had his tongue cut
out, so he trained the parrot to talk for him.

580
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,500
No one’s yet figured how.

581
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,200
Mr.Cotton's  parrot!
Same question.

582
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,300
Wind in the sails!
Wind in the sails!

583
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,900
- Mostly, we figure, that means "yes". 
- O’course it does. Satisfied?

584
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,900
Well, you’ve proved them mad.

585
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,300
And what’s the benefit for us?

586
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,200
Ana Maria.

587
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,600
- I suppose you didn’t deserve that one either?
- No, that one I deserved.

588
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,000
You stole my boat!
- Actually...

589
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,400
Borrowed, borrowed without permission.

590
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:35,600
- But with every intention of bringing it back to you.
- But you didn’t!

591
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,500
- You’ll get another one
- I will.

592
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,100
- A better one
- A better one!

593
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,600
- That one!
- What one?

594
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,700
Aye! That one. 

595
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,300
What say you!
Aye!

596
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,600
No, no, no, no, no, it’s frightful bad
luck to bring a woman aboard, sir.

597
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,600
It’d be far worse not to, have her.

598
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:42,100
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find...

599
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,400
With a compass that doesn't work?

600
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,400
Aye, the compass doesn't point north...

601
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,300
...but we're not trying to find north, are we?.

602
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:04,700
- We should drop canvas, sir.
- She can hold a bit longer.

603
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,000
What’s in your head that’s put you
in such a fine mood, Captain?

604
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,100
We’re catching up.

605
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,400
Time to go, Poppet!

606
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,400
Dead men tell no tales.

607
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,400
Puts a chill in the bones how many honest
sailors have been claimed by this passage.

608
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,000
How is it that Jack came by that compass?

609
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,300
Not a lot known about Jack Sparrow
before he showed up in Tortuga...

610
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,900
...with a mind to go after the treasure
of the Isla de Muerta.

611
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
That was before I met him.

612
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,500
Back when he was Captain of the Black Pearl.

613
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,500
What?

614
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,500
He failed to mention that.

615
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,500
Well, he plays things close to the vest now.
And a hard learned lesson it was.

616
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,800
See three days out on the venture the
irst mate comes to him and says...

617
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:22,200
...everything’s an equal share as should
be the location of the treasure too.

618
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,500
So, Jack gives up the bearings.
That night there was a mutiny.

619
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,500
They marooned Jack on an
island and left him to die.

620
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,000
But not before he’d gone
mad with the heat.

621
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,300
Ah. So that's the reason for the...

622
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,300
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

623
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:48,800
Now Will, when a pirate is marooned
he is a given a pistol with a single shot.

624
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,000
Well it won't do much good
hunting or to be rescued.

625
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:57,600
But after three weeks of starving
belly and thirst that pistol...

626
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,600
...starts to look real friendly.

627
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,100
But Jack escaped the island
and he still has that one shot.

628
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:09,500
Oh, but he won't use it though, save for
one man. His mutinous first mate.

629
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,700
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

630
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,800
- How did Jack get off the island?
- Well, I’ll tell you.

631
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:20,300
He waded out into the shallows and there
he waited three days and three nights...

632
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,800
...till all manner of sea creature came
and acclimated to his presence...

633
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,100
And on the fourth morning...

634
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:31,300
He roped himself a couple of sea turtles,
harnessed them together and made a raft!

635
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:37,500
- He roped a couple of sea turtles?
- Aye, sea turtles.

636
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,300
What did he use for rope?

637
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,500
Human hair...

638
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,200
...from my back.

639
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,400
Let go of the anchor!

640
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,800
Let go of the anchor, sir.

641
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,900
Young Mr. Turner and
I are to go ashore.

642
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,300
Captain! What if the worst should happen?

643
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,200
- Keep to the code.
- Aye, the code.

644
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,200
- Ten years of hoarding swag.
- And now we’re finally getting to spend it.

645
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,200
Once we’re quit of the
curse we’ll be rich men.

646
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,900
And you can buy an eye that actually
 fits and is made of glass.

647
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,400
This one does splinter
something terrible.

648
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,400
Stop rubbing it.

649
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,400
- What code is Gibbs to keep to if the worst should happen?
- Pirate’s code. 

650
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Any man that falls behind is left behind.

651
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,500
No heroes amongst thieves, eh.

652
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:33,700
You know for having such a bleak outlook on
pirates you’re well on your way to becoming one.

653
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:40,200
Sprung a man from jail, commandeered
a ship of the Fleet...

654
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:44,200
...sailed with a buccaneer crew out of Tortuga.

655
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,500
And you’re completely
obsessed with treasure.

656
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,100
That’s not true. I’m not
obsessed with treasure.

657
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,900
Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.

658
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:08,700
- Gentlemen, the time has come!
- Aye!

659
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:12,000
- Salvation is nigh!
- Aye!

660
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
- Our torment is near at end!
- Elizabeth?

661
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,800
For ten years we’ve been tested and
tried and each man, jack you here...

662
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:23,800
has proved his mettle
a hundred timesover!

663
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,800
- And a hundred times again!
- Aye!

664
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:30,800
Suffered I have.

665
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:37,700
Punished we were. The lot of us
disproportionate to our crime!

666
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:40,700
Here it is!

667
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,600
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

668
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:54,000
Every last piece that went
astray we have returned...

669
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,900
...save for this.

670
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,400
- Jack.
- Not yet.

671
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,700
We wait for the opportune moment.

672
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:06,900
When’s that?

673
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,600
When it’s of greatest profit to you?

674
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,600
May I ask you something?

675
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,700
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

676
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:20,900
Do us a favor, I know it’s difficult
for you but please stay here.

677
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,700
And try not to do anything stupid.

678
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:31,700
And who among us has paid the blood
sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

679
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,600
- Us!
- And whose blood must yet to be paid?

680
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,000
Hers!

681
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:43,700
You know the first thing I’m goin’
to do after the curse is lifted...

682
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,800
...eat a whole bushel of apples.

683
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,300
Begun by blood, by blood undone.

684
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:08,900
Sorry, Jack, I’m not going
to be your leverage.

685
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,500
That’s it?

686
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,900
Waste not.

687
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,200
Did it work?

688
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I don’t feel no different?

689
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
How do we tell.

690
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,400
You’re not dead

691
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:15,900
No.

692
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,700
- He shot me.
- It didn’t work.

693
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,600
The curse it still upon us.
- Yes!

694
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:31,300
You, maid! Your father, what was his name?
Was your father William Turner?

695
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,900
- No.
- Where’s his child?

696
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,900
The child that sailed from
England eight years ago?

697
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,300
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

698
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:44,300
Where?

699
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:52,100
You two! You brought us the wrong person!

700
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:56,100
- Aye!
- No! She had the medallion...

701
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,000
...she’s the proper age.

702
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
She said her name was
Turner, you heard her

703
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,600
You brought us here for nothing!

704
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:12,600
I won’t take questions and no second guesses,
not from the likes of you, Master Twigg?

705
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Who’s to blame? Every decision you’ve
made has led us from bad to worse.

706
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:23,100
- It was you who sent Bootstrap to the depths!
- Aye!

707
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:29,300
And it’s you who brought us here in the first place!
- Aye!

708
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:33,300
Any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

709
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,800
I say, we cut her throat
and spill all her blood.

710
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,200
Just in case.
- Yeah!

711
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:54,300
The medallion! She’s taken it!
Well, after her!

712
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:58,300
You pack of ingrates!

713
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:08,700
The oars have gone missing.
Find them!

714
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:23,700
- You. You’re supposed to be dead!
- Am I not?

715
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:52,700
- Parley!
- That’s the one. Parley! Parley.

716
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:59,100
Damned to the depths whatever
man had thought of parley?

717
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,700
That would be the French.

718
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,600
- Not more pirates!
- Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

719
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,100
- Mr. Gibbs?
- Hey, boy! Where be Jack?

720
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,700
Jack?
Jack Sparrow?

721
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,800
He fell behind.

722
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,500
Keep to the code!

723
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,200
Raise anchor!

724
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:44,200
Hoist the sails!
Make quickly.

725
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,100
How the blazes did you
get off that island?

726
01:14:54,200 --> 01:15:00,200
When you marooned me on that godforsaken spit
of land, you forgot one very important thing mate...

727
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,400
I’m Captain Jack Sparrow. 

728
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,400
Ah, well, I won't be making
that mistake again.

729
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:12,900
- Gents, you all remember Captain Jack Sparrow?
- Yeah!

730
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,000
Kill him!

731
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
The girl’s blood didn’t work, did it?

732
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,500
Hold your fire!

733
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,200
You know whose blood we need?

734
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,900
I know whose blood ye need.

735
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,500
What sort of a man trades
a man’s life for a ship?

736
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,800
Pirate.

737
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,100
- Here, let me.
- Thank you.

738
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,400
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours. Why?

739
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,200
I don’t know.

740
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:10,500
I’m sorry. Blacksmith’s hands,
I know they’re rough.

741
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,800
No...I mean yes,
they are but...

742
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:18,500
...but don’t stop.

743
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,100
Elizabeth.

744
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,400
It’s yours.

745
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,100
I thought I’d lost it the
day they rescued me.

746
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:57,100
It was a gift from my father,
he sent it to me.

747
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,100
Why did you take it?

748
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:08,600
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

749
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,200
That would’ve been awful.

750
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,000
It wasn’t your blood they needed...

751
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:22,700
it was my father’s blood...

752
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,200
My blood.

753
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,800
The blood of a pirate.

754
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:36,300
I’m so sorry, please forgive me.

755
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,600
So you expect to leave me standing on some
beach with nothing but a name and your word ...

756
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:57,800
...it’s the one I need and watch
you sail away on my ship?

757
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:02,900
No. I expect to leave you standing on
some beach with absolutely no name...

758
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:09,300
...at all, watching me sail away on my ship
and then I’ll shout the name back to you.

759
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,300
Savvy?

760
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,900
 But that still leaves us with the problem
of me standing on some beach with naught 

761
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:17,600
...but a name and your word
it's the one I need.

762
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:23,400
Of the two of us I am the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

763
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Therefore my word is the
one we'll be trusting.

764
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:32,200
Although, I suppose I should be
thanking you because in fact...

765
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,800
...if you hadn’t betrayed
me and left me to die...

766
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,500
...I would have an equal share
in that curse same as you.

767
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,000
Funny old world, innit?

768
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,900
Captain, we’re coming
up on the Interceptor.

769
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I’m having a thought here, Barbossa.
What say we run up a flag of truce?

770
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,700
I scurry over to the Interceptor...

771
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,600
...and I negotiate the return
of your medallion, aye?

772
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,700
What say you to that?

773
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,700
Now you see, Jack , that’s exactly the
attitude that lost you the Pearl.

774
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:15,900
Now you see, Jack , that’s exactly the
attitude that lost you the Pearl. 

775
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,100
People are easy to search
when they’re dead.

776
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,800
Lock him in the brig!

777
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:42,600
- What’s happening?
- The Black Pearl, she’s gaining on us.

778
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,400
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

779
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:52,000
You can tell them that
after they’ve caught us.

780
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,000
We’re shallow on the draft, right?

781
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:57,000
Well, then can't we lose them
amongst those shoals?

782
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,700
We don’t have to outrun them
long, just long enough.

783
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:04,400
- Lighten the ship.
Stem to stern!

784
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,700
Anything that we can afford to lose...
see that it’s lost!

785
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,300
Apparently there’s a leak.

786
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,600
Haul on the main brace.
Make ready the guns.

787
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,900
And run out the sweeps.

788
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:09,500
We’re gonna need that.

789
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:22,200
- It was a good plan up ‘till now.
- Gibbs!

790
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:26,200
- We have to make a stand.
We must fight!

791
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:28,000
- Load the guns!
- With what?

792
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Anything. Everything!
Anything we have left.

793
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,600
Load the guns!

794
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:40,100
Nails and crushed glass!

795
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
With a will.

796
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,800
The pearl is going to lap up on our port quarter.

797
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,500
She’ll rake us without ever presenting a target!

798
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:11,900
Lower the anchor on the right side.

799
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:16,500
- On the starboard side!
- It certainly has the element of surprise.

800
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:20,500
- You’re daft, lady! You both are.
- Daft like Jack.

801
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,800
Lower the starboard anchor!

802
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,600
Do it ye dogs or it’s you we’ll
load into the cannons!

803
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,600
Let go!

804
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:57,300
Hard aport.
Rack the starboard oars!

805
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,300
Keep us steady now!

806
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,700
- Fire!
- Fire!

807
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,500
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

808
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:24,300
We could use a few more ideas, lass!
- Your turn!

809
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,700
We need us a devil’s dowry.

810
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:30,600
- We’ll give them her.
- She’s not what they’re after.

811
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,200
The medallion.

812
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,400
Hands! Grapples, at the ready.
Prepare to board!

813
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,400
!

814
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:46,500
...to the powder magazine! And the 
rest of you bring me the medallion!

815
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,400
Hey! Hey! Below!

816
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,400
Thanks very much.

817
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:53,000
Jack!

818
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,300
Bloody empty.

819
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:12,700
That’s not very nice.

820
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:19,700
Where's the medallion?

821
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:23,700
Wretch!

822
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:27,400
- Ah, where’s dear William ?
- Will.

823
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,300
I can’t move it!

824
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:05,100
- Why thank you, Jack.
- You’re welcome.

825
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:08,800
Not you. We named the monkey Jack. 

826
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:13,100
- Gents, our hope is restored!
- Yeah!

827
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:53,500
If any of you as much as thinks the word parley,
I’ll have your guts for garters.

828
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:05,700
Stop it!

829
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:11,200
Welcome back, Miss. You took
advantage of our hospitality last time.

830
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:15,000
It holds fair now that
you return the favor.

831
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:21,900
Barbossa!

832
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,200
She goes free!

833
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,600
- What’s in your head, boy!
- She goes free!

834
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,900
You’ve only got one shot
and we can’t die.

835
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:39,900
Don’t do anything stupid.

836
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,900
You can’t...I can.

837
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:53,300
- Who are you?
- No one. He’s no one.

838
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:57,300
A distant cousin of my aunt’s
nephew twice removed.

839
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:59,300
Lovely singing voice, though.
Eunuch.

840
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:03,200
My name is Will Turner.
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

841
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:06,300
His blood runs in my veins.

842
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:10,300
He's a spitting image of ol' Bootstrap
Bill come back to haunt us.

843
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:15,200
On my word do as I say or I’ll pull this trigger.

844
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,000
And be lost forever to
Davy Jones’ Locker.

845
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
- Name your terms, Mr. Turner .
- Elizabeth goes free.

846
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:24,400
Yes, we know that one.
Anything else?

847
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:30,300
And the crew, the crew
are not to be harmed.

848
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,600
Agreed.

849
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:59,500
Barbossa, you lying bastard!
You swore she’d go free.

850
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:05,200
Don’t dare impugn me honor, boy.
I agreed she’d go free it was you who failed...

851
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,500
...to specify when or where.

852
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:17,000
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don’t it lads?

853
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:22,200
So I’ll be having that
dress back before you go?

854
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,700
I always liked you.

855
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:32,900
It goes with your black heart.

856
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:36,900
Ooh, it’s still warm.

857
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:41,200
Off you go!

858
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:43,800
Come on!

859
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,200
Too long!

860
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:02,500
I really had rather hoped
we were past all this.

861
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:06,600
Jack, Jack.

862
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:11,000
Did ya not notice? That be the same
little island that we made you Governor.

863
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Of on our last little trip.

864
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,700
I did notice.

865
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:20,700
Perhaps you’ll be able to conjure
up another miraculous escape.

866
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:24,700
But I doubt it.

867
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,100
Off you go.

868
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:30,800
Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.

869
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:35,100
By the powers, you’re right. Were
be Jack ’s pistol? Bring it forward.

870
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:43,700
Seeing as there’s two of us, a gentleman
would give us a pair of pistols.

871
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:47,400
It’ll be one pistol as before
and you can be the gentleman...

872
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:51,200
...and shoot the lady and
starve to death yourself.

873
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:18,500
That’s the second time I’ve had to watch
that man sail away with my ship.

874
01:33:21,300 --> 01:33:25,300
But you were marooned on this island before, weren’t you?
So we can escape in the same way you did then

875
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,800
To what point and purpose, young missy?

876
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,200
The Black Pearl is gone.

877
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:33,900
And unless you have a rudder and
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

878
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:38,400
Unlikely, young Mr.Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

879
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,200
But you’re Captain Jack Sparrow.

880
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:48,400
You vanished from under the eyes of
7 agents of the East India Company.

881
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:51,700
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot.

882
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:53,900
Are you the pirate
I’ve read about or not?

883
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:57,900
How did you escape last time?

884
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,800
Last time...I was here a grand
total of three days, alright?

885
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:11,800
Last time...

886
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,600
...the rumrunners used this island as a cache.

887
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,100
Came by and I was able
to barter a passage off.

888
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:22,800
From the looks of things, they’ve
long been out of business.

889
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:27,600
Probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

890
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:30,300
So that’s it then?

891
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,500
That’s the secret grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow?

892
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:40,200
You spent three days lying
on a beach, drinking rum!

893
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:44,600
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

894
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:57,600
We're devils and black sheep
and really bad eggs.

895
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:04,000
Drink up me 'earties yo ho!
Yo ho yo ho a pirate's life for me!

896
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,700
I love this song!

897
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Really bad eggs!

898
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:20,600
When I get the Pearl back,
I’m gonna teach it to the whole crew.

899
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:22,700
And we'll sing it all the time.

900
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,100
And you’ll be positively the most
fearsome pirate in the Spanish Main.

901
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,300
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

902
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,900
The entire ocean...
the entire world.

903
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:36,100
Wherever we want to go, we'll go.

904
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,500
That’s what a ship is, you know?

905
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:41,800
It’s not just a keel and a hull and a deck
and sails that's what a ship needs...

906
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:44,800
But what a ship is...

907
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:48,700
What the Black Pearl really is...

908
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:51,800
...is freedom.

909
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:55,300
Jack...

910
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:59,800
It must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

911
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,500
Oh, yes.

912
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:07,200
But the company is infinitely
better than last time, I think.

913
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:11,800
And the scenery has definitely improved...

914
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:14,900
Mr. Sparrow, I’m not entirely sure...

915
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:18,200
...that I’ve had enough rum
to allow that kind of talk.

916
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:21,700
I know exactly what you mean, love.

917
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:29,700
To freedom!

918
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:34,800
To the Black Pearl.

919
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:05,800
No! Not good!

920
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:08,800
Stop! Not good!

921
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:12,800
What are you doing? You burned
all the food, the shade, the rum!

922
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,400
Yes, the rum is gone.

923
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:16,100
Why is the rum gone?

924
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:21,400
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the
most respectable men into complete scoundrels.

925
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:22,800
Two, that signal is over a thousand feet high.
 The entire Royal Navy is out looking for me.

926
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,800
Two, that signal is over a thousand feet high.
The entire Royal Navy is out looking for me.

927
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:29,900
Do you really think that there is even the
slightest chance that they won’t see it?

928
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,200
But why is the rum gone?

929
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:35,000
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

930
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:38,100
You give it one hour, maybe two, keep a
weather eye out and then you will see...

931
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,100
...white sails on that horizon.

932
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,400
Must’ve been terrible for you to be trapped here, Jack.

933
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:51,100
Must’ve been terrible for you...

934
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:53,100
Well it bloody is now!

935
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,000
There’ll be no living
with her after this.

936
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:06,000
But we’ve got to save Will!
- No!

937
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:07,400
You’re safe now.

938
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:11,300
We will return to Port Royal immediately
not go gallivanting after pirates.

939
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:13,500
Then we condemn him to death.

940
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:16,700
The boy’s fate is regrettable. 

941
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:20,300
But then so is his decision
to engage in piracy.

942
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:23,700
To rescue me, to prevent anything
from happening to me!

943
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,300
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion.

944
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,700
The Pearl was listing near
to scabbers after the battle.

945
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:33,300
It’s very unlikely she’ll be
able to make good time.

946
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:34,900
Think about it.

947
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:36,900
The Black Pearl.

948
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,900
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

949
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:43,800
How can you pass that up?

950
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:50,100
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr. Sparrow, not only myself.

951
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,500
Commodore, I beg you, please do this.

952
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,800
For me as a wedding gift.

953
01:38:56,700 --> 01:39:00,700
Elizabeth. Are you accepting
the Commodore’s proposal?

954
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,000
I am.

955
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:08,400
A wedding!
I love weddings, drinks all around!

956
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:14,100
I know. Clap him in irons, right

957
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:17,800
Mr.Sparrow.

958
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:20,900
You will accompany these fine
men to the helm and provide us... 

959
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,500
...with the bearing to Isla de Muerta.

960
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:28,000
You will then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings of the phrase...

961
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:30,600
"silent as the grave".

962
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:32,000
Do I make myself clear?

963
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:34,200
Inescapably clear.

964
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:41,300
Shiver me timbers.

965
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:45,300
Cotton ‘ere says you missed a bit.

966
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,300
You knew William Turner?

967
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:54,900
Old Bootstrap Bill ...we knew him.

968
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,600
Never sat well with Bootstrap
what we did to Jack Sparrow.

969
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,900
The mutiny and all.

970
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:04,200
He said it wasn’t right with the code.

971
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:08,600
That’s why he sent off a piece of
the treasure to you as it were.

972
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,900
He said we deserved to be cursed...

973
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,300
...and remain cursed.

974
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,000
- Stupid blighter
- Good man.

975
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,100
But as you can imagine...

976
01:40:21,500 --> 01:40:23,800
That didn’t sit too well
with the Captain.

977
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:28,700
That didn’t sit too well with the Captain,
at all. Tell him what Barbossa did.

978
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:30,800
I’m telling the story!

979
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,600
So...

980
01:40:35,400 --> 01:40:37,000
What the Captain did...

981
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:40,300
He strapped a cannon to
Bootstraps’ bootstraps.

982
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,100
The last we saw of old Bill Turner...

983
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:49,700
He was sinking to the crushing black
oblivion of Davy Jones’ Locker.

984
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:52,900
Course it was only after that...

985
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,600
We learned we needed his
blood to lift the curse.

986
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:58,400
That’s what you call ironic.

987
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:04,500
Bring him!

988
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,000
I don’t care for the situation. 

989
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:17,100
Any attempt to storm the  cave
could turn to an ambush.

990
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:19,700
Not if you’re the one doing the ambushing.

991
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:24,000
I go in to convince Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

992
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,900
You and your mates return to the Dauntless and blast the
bejesus outta them with your little cannons, aye?

993
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:31,800
What do you have to lose?

994
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,300
Nothing I’d lament being rid of.

995
01:41:36,900 --> 01:41:38,900
Now, to be quite honest with you...

996
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:44,000
There’s still a slight risk for those aboard the Dauntless
which includes the future Mrs. Commodore.

997
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:46,900
Sorry, but for your own safety.

998
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:50,600
I don't care what the Commodore
ordered, I must tell him.

999
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:54,800
- The pirates…they cannot be killed!
- Don’t worry, miss, he’s already informed of that.

1000
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:57,700
A little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story.

1001
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:01,400
This is Jack Sparrow’s doing.

1002
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,500
No reason to fret, it’s just a prick of
the finger and a few drops of blood.

1003
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:20,500
No mistakes this time. He’s only
half-Turner. We spill it all.

1004
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:26,200
Guess there is reason to fret.

1005
01:42:40,700 --> 01:42:42,400
Beg your pardon.

1006
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,100
Begun by blood...

1007
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:44,800
Excuse me.

1008
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,000
By blood un...

1009
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Jack.

1010
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:54,600
- It’s not possible.
- Not probable.

1011
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:59,700
- Where’s Elizabeth ?
- She’s safe, just like I promised.

1012
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:03,700
She's all set to marry Norrington,
just like she promised.

1013
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:05,500
And you get to die for her,
just like you promised

1014
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,000
So we're all men of our word really.

1015
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:11,200
Except for Elizabeth who
is, in fact, a woman.

1016
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:13,300
Shut up! You’re next!

1017
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,400
You don’t want to be doing that, mate.

1018
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:21,900
No, I really think I do.

1019
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:24,400
Your funeral.

1020
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:31,300
- Why don’t I want to be doing it?
- Well, because...

1021
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,900
Because the HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy...

1022
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:40,900
Is floating just offshore...

1023
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:43,200
Waiting for you.

1024
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,400
What are we doing here?

1025
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,500
Pirates come out...
unprepared and unawares.

1026
01:43:58,200 --> 01:43:59,700
We catch them in the crossfire...

1027
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:02,700
Send them down to see old Hobb.

1028
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:06,100
I know why we’re here.
I mean...

1029
01:44:06,300 --> 01:44:10,300
Why aren’t we doing what it was what
Mr. Sparrow said we should do...

1030
01:44:10,300 --> 01:44:14,300
With the cannons and all.
Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.

1031
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:19,500
You think he wasn’t telling the truth?

1032
01:44:20,100 --> 01:44:21,700
Just hear me out, mate.

1033
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:25,800
You order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best.

1034
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,500
Robert’s your Uncle Fannie’s your Aunt,
there you are with two ships.

1035
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:34,100
The makings of your very own fleet.

1036
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:37,400
‘Course you’ll take the grandest as
your flagship and who’s to argue?

1037
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,400
But what of the Pearl?

1038
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:42,100
Name me Captain.

1039
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:47,800
I'll sail under your colors, I’ll give you ten percent of
me plunder and you get to introduce yourself as...

1040
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:51,900
...Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?

1041
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:56,100
I supose in exchange you want
me not to kill the whelp.

1042
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:59,100
No, no, not at all by all
means, kill the whelp.

1043
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:00,700
Just not yet...

1044
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:04,000
Wait to lift the curse...

1045
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06,600
Until the opportune moment.

1046
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,700
For instance...

1047
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:15,700
After you’ve killed Norrington’s men...

1048
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,300
every... last... one.

1049
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:33,300
You’ve been planning this
from the beginning. 

1050
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:35,700
Ever since you learned my name.

1051
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:37,300
Yeah.

1052
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,000
I want fifty percent of your plunder.

1053
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:42,300
- 15% - 40%

1054
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,900
- 25%

1055
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,500
And I’ll buy you the hat...

1056
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:48,400
A really big one...

1057
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,300
Commodore.

1058
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:54,400
We have an accord!

1059
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,900
All hand’s to the boats!

1060
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,600
Apologies, you give the orders.

1061
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:04,800
Gents...

1062
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:08,600
- Take a walk!
- Aye!

1063
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:13,600
Not to the boats?

1064
01:47:12,600 --> 01:47:14,100
Hold fire!

1065
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:20,300
This is just like what the
Greeks done at Troy.

1066
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:24,700
Except they was in a
horse instead of dresses.

1067
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:26,000
Wooden horse.

1068
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
A moment, please.

1069
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:53,600
I just want you to know I believe you
made a very good decision today.

1070
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:56,800
Couldn’t be more proud of you.

1071
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:01,900
But you know, even a good decision
if made for the wrong reasons...

1072
01:48:01,900 --> 01:48:03,000
...can be a wrong decision?

1073
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:13,500
Lieutenant?

1074
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:37,700
Are you there?

1075
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:41,300
Elizabeth, are you even listening to me?

1076
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:10,600
Oh, what have you done?

1077
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:15,400
Stop that!
I already feel like a fool.

1078
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:17,300
You look nice, though.

1079
01:50:00,900 --> 01:50:02,800
I must admit, Jack,
I thought I had you figured.

1080
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:06,700
It turns out that you’re
a hard man to predict.

1081
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:10,700
Me? I'm dishonest, and a dishonest
man you can always trust to be...

1082
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:11,900
...dishonest.

1083
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:15,800
Honestly. It's the honest
ones you want to watch out for.

1084
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:19,800
Because you can never predict when they're
going to do something incredibly...

1085
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:22,100
...stupid.

1086
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,400
You’re off the edge of the map, mate.
Here there be monsters.

1087
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:07,700
Roger that!

1088
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:10,900
What would you pick to eat first?
I think we should decide now.

1089
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:14,900
Just so we're ready
when the time comes.

1090
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:40,600
What was that?

1091
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:04,600
It’s Elizabeth!

1092
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:26,600
Make for the ship! Move!

1093
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,400
The ship!

1094
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,600
You can’t beat me Jack!

1095
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:47,500
That’s interesting.

1096
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,000
Couldn’t resist, mate.

1097
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:20,100
So what now, Jack Sparrow? Will
it be it two immortals locked in...

1098
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:24,100
An epic battle until Judgment
Day and trumpets sound?

1099
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,900
Or you could surrender.

1100
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:56,100
All of you with me. Will is in that
cave and we must save him.

1101
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:59,000
Ready? And heave!

1102
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:08,900
Please, I need your help, come on.

1103
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:10,900
Any port in the storm.

1104
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:13,200
Cotton’s right, we’ve got the Pearl.

1105
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:17,200
- What about Jack, you’re just going to leave him?
- Jack owes us a ship.

1106
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:20,000
- There’s the code to consider
- The code?

1107
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:26,300
You’re pirates, hang the
code and hang the rules.

1108
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:29,200
They’re more like guidelines anyway.

1109
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:34,400
Bloody pirates!

1110
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:50,700
- Is it supposed to be doing that?
- They’re stealing our ship.

1111
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:53,100
- Bloody pirates!

1112
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:07,500
Come on!

1113
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,400
I’m gonna teach you
the meaning of pain.

1114
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:57,800
You like pain?

1115
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:00,500
Try wearing a corset.

1116
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:14,700
- Whose side is Jack on?
- At the moment?

1117
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:52,600
No fair.

1118
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:20,100
Ten years you carry that pistol
and now you waste your shot.

1119
01:59:21,500 --> 01:59:22,900
He didn’t waste it.

1120
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:50,500
I feel...

1121
01:59:55,200 --> 01:59:56,600
...cold.

1122
02:00:58,600 --> 02:01:00,000
Parlay?

1123
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:03,200
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

1124
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:53,300
We should return to the Dauntless.

1125
02:01:56,300 --> 02:01:58,700
Your fiancé will be wanting
to know you’re safe.

1126
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:11,800
If you were waiting for the
opportune moment...

1127
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:15,100
...that was it.

1128
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:20,300
Now if you’ll be so kind, I’d be much
obliged if you’d drop me off my ship.

1129
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:28,100
I’m sorry, Jack.

1130
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:34,200
They done what’s right by them.
Can’t expect more than that.

1131
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:50,900
Jack Sparrow...

1132
02:02:52,900 --> 02:02:55,500
Captain.
Captain Jack Sparrow.

1133
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:58,800
For your willful commission
of crimes against the crown.

1134
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:04,600
Said crimes being numerous in
quantity and sinister in nature.

1135
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:08,600
The most grievous of these
to be cited herewith:

1136
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:11,300
Piracy, smuggling...

1137
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:13,200
This is wrong.

1138
02:03:13,200 --> 02:03:18,500
Commodore Norrington is bound
by the law. As are we all.

1139
02:03:19,300 --> 02:03:22,400
...impersonating an officer of
the Spanish Royal Navy...

1140
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:25,300
...impersonating a cleric of
the Church of England...

1141
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:32,400
...sailing under false colors, arson,
kidnapping, looting, poaching...

1142
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:41,000
...pilfering, depravity, depredation
and general lawlessness.

1143
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:46,300
And for these crimes you have been
sentenced to be on this day...

1144
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:48,700
...hung by the neck until dead.

1145
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,900
May God have mercy on your soul.

1146
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:55,700
Governor Swann.
Commodore.

1147
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Elizabeth.

1148
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:03,000
I should have told you every day
from the moment I met you...

1149
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:07,700
I love you.

1150
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:25,100
Marines.

1151
02:04:25,200 --> 02:04:27,400
Can’t breathe.

1152
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:29,800
Elizabeth.

1153
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:33,500
Move!

1154
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:51,400
I thought we might have to endure some
manner of ill conceived escape.

1155
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
...attempt but not from you.

1156
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:56,200
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1157
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:59,000
And this is how you thank me?

1158
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:02,400
By throwing in your lot with him?
He’s a pirate.

1159
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:04,300
And a good man.

1160
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:08,300
If all I have achieved here is that
the hangman will earn two pairs...

1161
02:06:08,300 --> 02:06:11,000
of boots instead of one,
so be it.

1162
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,400
At least my conscience
will be clear.

1163
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:17,400
You forget your place, Turner.

1164
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:21,300
It’s right here,
between you and Jack.

1165
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,200
- As is mine.
- Elizabeth.

1166
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:31,200
Lower your weapons!

1167
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:34,500
For goodness’ sake put them down!

1168
02:06:39,300 --> 02:06:42,200
So this is where your
heart truly lies, then?

1169
02:06:43,600 --> 02:06:45,000
It is.

1170
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:56,900
Well! I’m actually feeling
rather good about this.

1171
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,900
I think we've all arrived at
a very special place, eh?

1172
02:06:59,900 --> 02:07:03,900
Spiritually, ecumenically,
grammatically.

1173
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:09,100
I want you to know that
I was rooting for you, mate.

1174
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:10,800
Know that.

1175
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:16,600
Elizabeth...

1176
02:07:18,700 --> 02:07:20,600
...it would never have worked
between us, darling.

1177
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:25,300
I’m sorry.

1178
02:07:26,600 --> 02:07:28,100
Will.

1179
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:31,700
Nice hat.

1180
02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:34,200
Men!

1181
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:40,700
This is the day that you will always
remember as the day that you...

1182
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:48,300
Idiot.

1183
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:50,700
He has nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

1184
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,100
Sail ho!

1185
02:08:01,600 --> 02:08:03,000
What’s your plan of action?

1186
02:08:04,900 --> 02:08:06,400
Sir?

1187
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:13,900
Perhaps on the rare occasion,
pursuing the right course...

1188
02:08:13,900 --> 02:08:15,600
...demands an act of piracy...

1189
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:20,000
Piracy itself can be
the right course.

1190
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Mr.Turner.

1191
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,800
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1192
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:43,500
This is a beautiful sword.

1193
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:49,200
I would expect the man who made
it to show the same care and...

1194
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:51,100
...devotion in every
aspect of his life.

1195
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:54,000
Thank you.

1196
02:08:58,800 --> 02:08:59,700
Commodore!

1197
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:02,600
What about Sparrow?

1198
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:03,600
Well...

1199
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:07,600
I think we can afford to give
him one day's head start

1200
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:16,000
So, this is the path...

1201
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:20,000
...you've chosen, is it?

1202
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:24,000
After all...he is a blacksmith.

1203
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:26,000
No...

1204
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:31,900
He’s a pirate.

1205
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:11,500
I thought you were supposed
to keep to the code.

1206
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:14,500
We figured they were more
actual...guidelines.

1207
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:21,800
Thank you.

1208
02:10:22,900 --> 02:10:24,900
Captain Sparrow.

1209
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:30,300
...the Black Pearl is yours.

1210
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:48,200
On deck you scabbarous dogs!

1211
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:52,200
Man the braces!

1212
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:57,500
Now...bring me that horizon.

1213
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:07,000
And really bad eggs.

1214
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:14,000
Drink up, me 'arties yo ho...

1215
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:20,000
