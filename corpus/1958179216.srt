1
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,374
HEY, CONCORDE.

2
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,310
COME HERE, CONCORDE.

3
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,915
HAVE YOU GOT A CAT
IN YOUR APARTMENT?

4
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:56,950
A CAT?

5
00:01:56,983 --> 00:02:00,253
YEAH, A CAT.
I HEARD SOME MOANING
THE OTHER NIGHT.

6
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,589
GINO, I KNOW THIS IS
A "NO PETS" BUILDING.

7
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,225
WHAT'S THAT SMELL COMING FROM
UNDER YOUR DOOR, PAL?

8
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,364
- AROMATHERAPY!
- AROMA-WHAT?

9
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:15,268
CANDLES...
ROMANCE...

10
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,336
MOANING.

11
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:18,771
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- SPARE A DOLLAR?

12
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,840
YOU GOT CHANGE FOR A HUNDRED?

13
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,309
NOBODY LIKES A WISEASS.

14
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,645
HEY?

15
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,983
HEY, ROCKEFELLER?

16
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,885
WHAT ARE YOU GIVING
YOUR MONEY AWAY FOR?

17
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,953
YOU'RE A MONTH AND HALF
BEHIND ON THE RENT!

18
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,556
- SATURDAY!
- SATURDAY?

19
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,559
I'LL BE RINGING YOUR BELL
BRIGHT AND EARLY.

20
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,327
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE MONEY.

21
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,997
HEY, YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU
A COUPLE CANDLES?

22
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,266
YEAH, GET ME A COUPLE CANDLES.

23
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,567
IT'S VERY RELAXING.

24
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,701
YEAH, WELL RELAX THIS!

25
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,438
NO, NO,
I DON'T NEED ANY MONEY.

26
00:02:56,809 --> 00:03:01,514
I'VE GOTTA BIG DATE TONIGHT,
I GOTTA GO.

27
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,951
YEAH.

28
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,890
MAKE SURE YOU GIVE MOM
A BIG KISS FOR ME, OKAY?

29
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,759
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

30
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,768
LOOK AT THIS.

31
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,521
THERE YOU GO.

32
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,623
( meows )

33
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,405
LOLITA, I REMEMBER WHEN
THE "ELECTRIC COMPANY"

34
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,673
WAS A FUNNY KIDS' SHOW.

35
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,001
( coughs )

36
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,838
LOLITA! LOLITA!

37
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,355
( fire roars - crackles )

38
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,529
YOU GOT INSURANCE?

39
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,364
NO.

40
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,500
ME NEITHER.

41
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,905
SPARE A DOLLAR?

42
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,145
AROMATHERAPY?
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL IT?

43
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,415
YOU COULDN'T JUST DO 
PSYCHOTHERAPY LIKE THE REST
OF MY TENANTS?

44
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,684
LOOK AT THIS.

45
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,922
YOU'RE A SCHMUCK, KID.

46
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,692
( meowing )

47
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,594
LOLITA!

48
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,467
YOU GOT OUT OKAY!

49
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,406
JACK!

50
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,945
PARKER!

51
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,681
GEE, I DON'T KNOW IF NOW
IS THE BEST TIME.

52
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:52,185
JACK, MY APARTMENT BUILDING
NEARLY BURNED DOWN.

53
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:56,189
I'M SORRY.
I'M KIND OF IN
A SITUATION HERE.

54
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,957
JACK.

55
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,026
ALL RIGHT, COME ON IN.

56
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,461
woman: JACK?

57
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:05,198
IF IT COMES UP,
MY FIANCE DIED IN A TERRIBLE
TRAIN CRASH SIX MONTHS AGO.

58
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,133
THE TENTH FATALITY
THIS YEAR?

59
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,017
( crashing )

60
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,488
THANK YOU FOR CALLING
PSYCHIC PALS HOT LINE.

61
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:06,225
I SEE YOU TAKING A LONG VOYAGE.

62
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,800
AUDREY, I'M GONNA SHUFFLE
THE TAROT DECK HERE...

63
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,637
LET'S SEE WHAT THE CARDS
TELL US, SHALL WE?

64
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:24,977
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE HAVING
A DIFFICULT TIME IN LIFE...

65
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,612
AND...

66
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,150
AUDREY, THERE SEEMS TO BE
SOME KIND OF PROBLEM,

67
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,120
I'M GONNA PUT YOU ON HOLD.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

68
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:38,558
DO YOU REMEMBER THE "THREE S'S"?

69
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:42,962
SLOW, SUSTAIN...

70
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,697
- STATIC.
- STATIC.

71
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,066
OH, HEY--
YOU FORGOT SWINDLE.

72
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,067
( chuckles )

73
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,603
YOU KNOW THE LONGER
YOU KEEP THEM ON THE PHONE,

74
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,039
THE LONGER YOU KEEP YOUR JOB.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

75
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:01,214
THE TROUBLE SEEMS TO BE
GOING AWAY.

76
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,619
YOU'RE IN NEW YORK CITY, MAN.

77
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,322
THERE'S AN AMAZING
DESSERT TRAY OF BEAUTIFUL
WOMEN...

78
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,791
A LITTLE CREME
BRULEE.

79
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,660
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY,
YOU WORK AT A TALENT AGENCY,

80
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,095
SURROUNDED BY
BEAUTIFUL ACTRESSES.

81
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:18,598
DID I TELL YOU TO WORK
AT 1-900-CUCKOO?

82
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,868
IT WAS THE ONLY JOB I COULD GET
AFTER THE MAGAZINE FOLDED.

83
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,003
PARKER,
YOU ALWAYS DO THAT.

84
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:27,273
YOU WERE FIRED.
THE MAGAZINE FOLDED LATER.

85
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,879
IF THAT CONGRESSMAN HAD GIVEN ME
A QUOTE BEFORE HE WENT TO JAIL,

86
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,313
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD
TO MAKE ONE UP.

87
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,816
YOU OUGHT TO WRITE FICTION.
YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT.

88
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,752
HEY. JUST KEEP BREATHING,
ALL RIGHT?

89
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,588
THE WOMAN OF YOUR DREAMS
COULD BE AROUND THE CORNER.

90
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,323
THAT'S THE POWDER ROOM...

91
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,759
YES, BUT IT'S ALSO
THE BOYS' ROOM.

92
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,294
BOYS USE POWDER.

93
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:53,733
SOME, YES. 
THIS IS MATT...
AND TROY.

94
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,202
THEY'VE BEEN HERE THE LONGEST,
WHICH ISN'T SAYING MUCH,

95
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,038
SINCE THE EMPLOYEES HERE
HAVE THE SHELF LIFE OF SUSHI.

96
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,607
THAT YOUNG MAN LOOKS
VERY FOCUSED.

97
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,210
I BET HE'S AN EXCELLENT PSYCHIC.

98
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,078
WELL, IF ANY OF US
WERE REAL,

99
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,180
WE'D BE AT THE BELMONT'S
PICKING TRIFECTAS,

100
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,149
NOT MAKING EIGHT BUCKS AN HOUR.

101
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,719
YOU MEAN NOBODY HERE
IS REALLY A PSYCHIC?

102
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,689
- ARE YOU?
- OF COURSE I AM!

103
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,662
- THIS IS KIM...
- HI, KIM.

104
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,799
WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THE REST
OF OUR LIVES TOGETHER.

105
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,834
- DOES SHE KNOW THAT?
- NOT A CLUE.

106
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,637
- AND THAT'S MY CUBICLE?
- YES, YOU'RE THE LAST ONE.

107
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:35,074
Woman:
I have the coolest one bedroom
on the Upper West Side...

108
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,677
- with a view of the river.
- HOW MUCH?

109
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,414
- It's just $2,000
- A YEAR?

110
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:43,049
( hangs up - dial tone )

111
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,718
Hardwood floors,
high ceilings,

112
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,754
with oodles and oodles
of charm.

113
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,389
HOW MUCH?

114
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,993
Ah, $1,750.

115
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,295
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
WITH LESS "OODLES?"

116
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,664
This is a great place
in the East Village.

117
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,233
It's just three blocks
from Thompkins Square Park.

118
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:06,305
- HOW MUCH?
- For you? Just $1,500.

119
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,776
- YOU GOT ANYTHING CHEAPER?
- Yeah, in Cleveland.

120
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:23,656
(woman screaming
with pleasure)

121
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,282
HEY, PARK.

122
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,920
AREN'T YOU ON
THE EARLY SHIFT TOMORROW?

123
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,722
YEAH.

124
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,728
YOU OUGHT TO GET
SOME SHUT-EYE.

125
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,473
I ALMOST FORGOT.

126
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,909
NEED ICE.

127
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:20,179
JACK, NOTE FOR THE NEXT TIME--

128
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,848
THE ICE GOES IN FIRST
BEFORE YOU DRINK YOUR DRINK.

129
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,151
MAYBE IN YOUR BOOK.

130
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,397
I LUCKED INTO MY LAST APARTMENT.
BEING FROM IOWA CITY,

131
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,767
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT "RENT CONTROL" MEANT.

132
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,136
YOU SHOULD GET
A GOOD CHURCH GIRL

133
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,074
OR A GOOD COLLEGE GIRL,
SHACK UP AND SPLIT THE DUES.

134
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:51,077
YOU DON'T WANT THAT ONE,
THAT GIRL THINKS SHE'S PSYCHIC.

135
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,552
SHARE ADS...
PEOPLE ALWAYS NEED ROOMMATES.

136
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:03,389
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE ALL DEVIL
WORSHIPERS AND FREAKAZOIDS.

137
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,224
YEAH, BUT IT'S HALF
THE DAMAGE, MAN.

138
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:06,358
IT'S WORTH LOOKING INTO.

139
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,996
PARKER, I SEE A WHOLE NEW WORLD
OPENING UP FOR YOU,

140
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,467
AND A WONDERFUL
RELATIONSHIP.
( chuckles )

141
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,936
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.

142
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:19,972
SHE'S CRAZY.

143
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,841
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

144
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,910
THERE'S SOMETHING REAL SEXY
ABOUT HER IN THE RIGHT LIGHT.

145
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,056
YEAH, MAN, THIS IS
A REALLY COOL PAD.

146
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,597
BEER?

147
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,866
SURE.

148
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,103
RUNNING WATER...

149
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,974
PRIVACY...

150
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,811
WINDOW...

151
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,618
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR
LAST ROOMMATE?

152
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,254
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING.

153
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,223
MOVED TO THE BIG HOUSE.

154
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,059
OH, A HIGH RISE?

155
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:16,495
SING-SING.

156
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,898
MAJOR DRUG DEALER.

157
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,266
GUY WAS TENSE.

158
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:27,306
IT'S JUST BEEN SO HARD
TO FIND A ROOMMATE THAT, WELL,

159
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,609
MELDS WITH MY LIFESTYLE.

160
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,646
PEOPLE HAVE SUCH PRECONCEIVED
NOTIONS ABOUT WOMANHOOD

161
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,048
AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEM.

162
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:39,652
AND YOU DON'T MIND
ROOMING WITH A MAN?

163
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,855
NO. I DON'T MIND,

164
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,125
IF YOU DON'T.

165
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,329
"2B OR NOT 2B."

166
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,043
I'M HERE ABOUT THE APARTMENT?

167
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,951
YOU MUST BE PARKER.

168
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,989
WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

169
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:35,941
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT SOME
OF THE FLAKES THAT
ANSWERED MY AD

170
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,943
SAID THEY DID FOR A LIVING...

171
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,413
"PIERCING CONSULTANT,"
"TAROT CARD READER,"

172
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,917
( laughs )
HARDLY SPELLS "RELIABLE" TO ME.

173
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,187
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

174
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,257
UH, I'M IN... SALES.

175
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,692
TELEPHONE SALES.
IT'S JUST TEMPORARY,

176
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,361
UNTIL I GET ANOTHER
WRITING GIG.

177
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,630
I USED TO WORK
FOR "THE NEW YORK MINUTE,"

178
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,064
UNTIL IT FOLDED.

179
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,471
- COFFEE?
- SURE.

180
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,339
SO WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR
OTHER ROOMMATE?

181
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,975
GORDON AND I LIVED TOGETHER
FOR TWO YEARS.

182
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,178
HE JUST DECIDED IT WAS TIME
TO MOVE ON.

183
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,448
WE'RE STILL FRIENDS, THOUGH.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

184
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,385
ME AND JACK HAVE BEEN LIVING
TOGETHER FOR TWO WEEKS,

185
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,688
BUT HE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY. 
ALL HE THINKS ABOUT IS SEX.

186
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,690
I TOLD HIM THERE'S MORE
TO RELATIONSHIPS...

187
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:26,492
BUT HE WON'T LISTEN TO ME.

188
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,231
SO IT'S OVER BETWEEN
THE TWO OF YOU?

189
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:36,068
NAH, JACK AND I WILL ALWAYS BE
CLOSE, WE JUST SHOULDN'T LIVE
TOGETHER.

190
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,375
WELL, PARKER,

191
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,479
THE PLACE IS YOURS
IF YOU WANT IT.

192
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,715
SIX-FIFTY A MONTH
PLUS UTILITIES.

193
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,617
ALL RIGHT!

194
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,119
I HAVE A CAT.

195
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,355
THE BUILDING ALLOWS
PETS, RIGHT?

196
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,123
THE BUILDING DOES,
BUT I DON'T.

197
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:02,494
I MEAN, I CAN'T.
I'M, LIKE, REALLY ALLERGIC.

198
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:05,364
OH, GOD, I KNEW THIS
WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

199
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,234
ME, TOO.

200
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,337
SORRY.

201
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,108
YA' KNOW,

202
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:20,079
I'VE GOT A FRIEND
WHO'S LOOKING FOR A ROOMMATE,

203
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,814
COOL LOFT ON FIRST.

204
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,749
YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.

205
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,087
- I DEFINITELY WILL.
- I'LL PASS ON YOUR NUMBER.

206
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,222
HEY, KITTY.

207
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,659
WHAT'S THAT, HUH?

208
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,127
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

209
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,103
PARK, SAM CALLED
ABOUT THE APARTMENT.

210
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,139
MEET TOMORROW AT FOUR.
FIRST AVENUE.

211
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,041
FIRST AVENUE!
SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.

212
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,814
I READ ABOUT THIS WOMAN
IN ARMENIA

213
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:32,151
WHO ATE YOGURT EVERY SINGLE DAY
OF HER LIFE FOR 104 YEARS.

214
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,820
REALLY?
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

215
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,657
I GUESS SHE DIED.

216
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,230
( cash register beeping )

217
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,132
Cashier:
THAT'LL BE FOUR DOLLARS.

218
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,801
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH THAT?

219
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,305
UH, PUMPKIN PIE.

220
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,840
MY FAVORITE.

221
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,213
DO YOU, AH,
LIVE AROUND HERE?

222
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,651
ARE YOU COMING ON TO ME?

223
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,287
NO, I'M NOT COMING ON TO YOU.

224
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:13,225
I JUST CAME TO BUY A PUMPKIN!

225
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,894
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE,

226
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,263
I'D PREFER YOU JUST CAME OUT
AND SAID IT.

227
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,700
BELIEVE ME,
I'M NOT COMING ON TO YOU.

228
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,870
I BELIEVE YOU.

229
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,312
THAT'S $17.95.

230
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,528
Female voice:
Hello?

231
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,265
HI, IT'S PARKER CONCORDE,
ABOUT THE APARTMENT?

232
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,933
- Come on up.
- OKAY.

233
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,271
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

234
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,774
YES!

235
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,511
I MEAN, NO!

236
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,646
IS SAM HERE?

237
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,348
JUST A MINUTE.

238
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,220
HI, I'M SAM.
YOU MUST BE PARKER.

239
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,192
SMASHING PUMPKIN.

240
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,228
THIS IS BARNEY.
SAY HELLO, BARNEY.

241
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,431
HI, BARNEY.

242
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,803
PARKER, WHY DON'T YOU
AND YOUR PIE FILLING
COME INSIDE?

243
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,710
WOW, THIS IS REALLY NICE.

244
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:42,848
THANKS, I'M IN LOVE WITH IT.
ACTUALLY, IT'S MY COUSIN'S.

245
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,385
I'M JUST SUBLETTING WHILE
SHE'S IN PARIS STUDYING
AT THE SORBONNE.

246
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,890
SO, ARE YOU A PAINTER?

247
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:55,894
YEAH.
BUT I WORK AT THE
HAYDEN PLANETARIUM.

248
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,931
REALLY. WHAT'S THAT LIKE?

249
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,267
IT'S REALLY COOL,
I GET TO RUN SOME OF THE SHOWS,

250
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,003
TEACH THE KIDS,
AND BEING SUCH AN ASTRONOMY BUFF

251
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,438
I REALLY CAN'T BEAT IT.

252
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,340
IS THIS ONE
OF YOUR PAINTINGS?

253
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,274
YEAH.

254
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,714
OH, DO YOU SELL THESE?

255
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:18,283
NO, BUT I'D LIKE TO
ONE DAY,

256
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,853
YOU KNOW, HAVE A SHOWING
AT SOME SOHO GALLERY,

257
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,489
SUPPORT MYSELF WITH MY ART.

258
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,425
NOBLE, HUH?

259
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,893
YEAH.

260
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,033
WOW, THAT'S A DINOSAUR.
LOOK AT THAT.

261
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,836
IT'S MY MOM'S OLD STEREO.
HER ALBUMS, TOO.

262
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,372
"WEST SIDE STORY,"
THAT'S MY FAVORITE!

263
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,773
REALLY?
MINE TOO!

264
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,478
( barks )

265
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:50,682
OH, DON'T MIND HIM.
HE'LL WARM UP ONCE HE
GETS USED TO YOU.

266
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,317
I HOPE HE HAS A CHANCE.

267
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,758
NOW, I KNOW IT'S SMALL,
BUT IT GETS A LOT OF LIGHT.

268
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,696
AND THE BED'S
PRACTICALLY BRAND NEW.

269
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,300
DAVID LEFT IT WHEN HE AND CURT
MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO.

270
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,410
SEE? PRETTY FIRM.

271
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,452
OH, BY THE WAY,

272
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,422
I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT
YOU AND YOUR FRIEND, JACK.

273
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,124
TOM GAVE ME
ALL THE INFO ON YOU--

274
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:35,761
WRITER, PHONE SALES,
CAT, CUTE.

275
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:40,065
SO, YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
ROOMING WITH GUYS?

276
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,937
NO, I MEAN, BEFORE DAVID
IT WAS DEAN,

277
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,442
AND BEFORE DEAN IT WAS PHILIP,
AND BEFORE PHILIP--

278
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,110
WELL, ANYWAY,
YOU GET THE POINT.

279
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,946
I FEEL SAFER LIVING 
WITH A MAN.

280
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,683
PLUS, I MADE SOME GREAT FRIENDS.

281
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,488
SO, YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT
THINGS TURNING ROMANTIC?

282
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,424
ROMANTIC?

283
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,893
I MEAN, YOU'RE VERY--

284
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,395
YOU'RE A VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.

285
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,665
OH, THANK YOU, PARKER.

286
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:17,469
THAT'S WHY I ONLY LIVE
WITH MEN WHO ARE GAY.

287
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,940
YOU KNOW, SAM,
I'D REALLY LIKE TO LIVE HERE.

288
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:26,478
I'D LOVE TO LIVE HERE.
BUT, I'M NOT--

289
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,848
OH GOD,
YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL HANDS!

290
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:33,852
THESE ARE ARTIST'S HANDS,
LARGE AND STRONG,

291
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,555
YET GRACEFUL AND WELL-FORMED.

292
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,491
YOU HAVE A REALLY GOOD
LIFELINE, TOO.

293
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,096
I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS IT
YOU WERE GOING TO TELL ME?

294
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,164
( sighs )

295
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,967
I'M NOT...

296
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:55,207
READY TO MOVE IN IMMEDIATELY.

297
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,410
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.
WHEN CAN YOU MOVE IN?

298
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:02,481
TOMORROW?

299
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,418
GOOD.

300
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,457
IT HAPPENED SO FAST.

301
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:14,760
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY.

302
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,496
THREE LITTLE WORDS,
"I'M NOT GAY."

303
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,197
HOW EASY IS THAT?

304
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,633
YEAH, BUT SHE'D ONLY ROOM
WITH GAY GUYS.

305
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,835
IT MAKES SENSE,
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

306
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,604
WHICH OBVIOUSLY YOU DIDN'T.

307
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,572
SO SHE THINKS I'M GAY.

308
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:30,509
I GET TO LIVE IN A HUGE LOFT
WITH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

309
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,612
FOR AN ASTOUNDING, BY NEW YORK
STANDARDS, $550 A MONTH.

310
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:36,748
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN
YOU WANT TO DO THE FILTHY
NASTY WITH HER

311
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:40,252
AND ALL SHE WANTS FROM YOU
IS AN OPINION ON WHICH EARRINGS
TO WEAR WITH A DRESS?

312
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:44,556
BESIDES, WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT BEING GAY?

313
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,892
WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT
BEING A PSYCHIC?

314
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,827
I'LL FAKE IT.

315
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,502
WORD GETS OUT FAST.

316
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:07,779
WOW. I WISH I COULD
TRAVEL THAT LIGHT.

317
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,849
IF YOU HAVE A FIRE,
GIVES LIGHT A WHOLE NEW MEANING.

318
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,519
I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT.
( laughs )

319
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,994
FLAMES WERE EVERYWHERE.
I RAN OUT ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE,

320
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:25,263
AND FOUND LOLITA ON THE STREET,
THANK GOD.

321
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,732
DID THEY EVER FIND OUT
WHAT STARTED IT?

322
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:31,136
YEAH, SOME GUY WAS PRACTICING
AROMATHERAPY AND FELL ASLEEP.

323
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,940
WHAT A MORON.

324
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,044
WORST PART IS
I LOST MY COMPUTER.

325
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,279
MY PARENTS GAVE IT TO ME
FOR MY TRIP TO NEW YORK,

326
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,815
SORT OF LIKE,
FOR GOOD LUCK.

327
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,552
- OH, EVERYTHING ON IT?
- EVERYTHING--

328
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,821
MY NOTES, STORIES, OUTLINES.

329
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,791
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT WAS
LIKE A SIGN FROM UP ABOVE.

330
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:56,695
"PARKER, DON'T QUIT
YOUR DAY JOB!"

331
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,901
WHAT'S THIS?

332
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,206
ANOTHER SIGN.

333
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:13,912
YOU KNOW, I NEVER ASKED YOU,
WHAT DO YOU SELL, EXACTLY?

334
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:17,115
UH... FUTURES.

335
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:20,986
OH. MY FRIEND FRANK IS
IN COMMODITIES AT GOLDMAN SACHS.

336
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,623
YOU GUYS HAVE TO MEET...
HE IS VERY CUTE.

337
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,692
SO NOW THAT
YOU'RE SINGLE AGAIN,

338
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,895
DO YOU HAVE YOUR EYE
ON ANY CUTE GUYS?

339
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:34,132
NO, NOT A ONE.
YOU?

340
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:39,671
YEAH, HIS NAME'S BEN.
HE'S... WONDERFUL!

341
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,307
WE'VE BEEN DATING
FOR ABOUT A MONTH.

342
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,578
HE'S VERY SWEET AND FUNNY
AND HE'S VERY HANDSOME.

343
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:51,082
- WHAT'S YOUR TYPE?
- MY TYPE?

344

ONE, YOU CAN TELL HER THE TRUTH

IF SHE FINDS OUT

436
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:07,025
I'VE DREAMT OF BEING
LOST IN THE LOUVRE,

438
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:13,164

INTERESTING GUYS?

452
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:04,082

BUT HE PROBABLY WON'T CALL.

460
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:37,482

HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SO MANY
HOT MEN IN ONE PLACE?

514
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,012
I CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE.

515
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,827
THE CROWD'S A LOT
LIKE PIZZA!

516
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,331
YOU KNOW?
EVEN WHEN IT'S BAD,
IT'S GOOD!

517
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:56,774
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU WANTED
TO HOOK UP TONIGHT, PARKER.

518
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:59,610
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
A LOT SINCE WE FIRST MET.

519
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:04,081
I MEAN, THERE'S LOTS
OF ATTRACTIVE GUYS OUT THERE,

520
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,685
BUT IT'S HARD TO FIND ONE
THAT'S ALSO REAL.

521
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:12,056
YOU SEEM VERY REAL
TO ME...

522
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:16,093
AND A LITTLE SHY, TOO.
I LIKE THAT.

523
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,703
HEY, PARKER,
HOW ABOUT THAT BEER
YOU OWE ME!

524
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,938
MATT!

525
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,142
PLEASE, DON'T STOP
ON ACCOUNT OF ME.

526
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:35,980
I GOTTA TELL YOU, DUDE,
I AM SO SURPRISED RIGHT NOW.

527
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,015
I AM SO SURPRISED TOO!

528
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:43,154
BUT, HEY, COOL!
GLAD TO HAVE YOU...

529
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:45,656
ON "THE BUS."

530
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,392
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO DANCE?
- LOVE TO!

531
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,997
I'LL CATCH YOU
BACK AT THE OFFICE!

532
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,965
COUNTING ON IT.

533
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,738
( upbeat music )

534
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,523
( music changes to slow song )

535
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,835
HEY, LET'S GRAB A CAB.

536
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,461
I HAD A BLAST
TONIGHT, PARKER. 

537
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:05,669
YEAH, IT WAS VERY...
DIFFERENT.

538
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,572
IT WAS DIFFERENT
FOR ME, TOO.

539
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,676
THIS IS MY STOP.

540
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,847
MAYBE WE CAN SEE
A MOVIE THIS WEEKEND.

541
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:20,584
OH, THAT'D BE--
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU
ON THAT.

542
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:23,621
THE GAY FILM FESTIVAL'S
PLAYING AT THE ANGELIKA.

543
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,090
THANK YOU
FOR THE FLOWERS.

544
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,049
ALL RIGHT, PARKER...

545
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,718
- SPILL!
- SPILL WHAT?

546
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:57,822
I'M DYING TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT BEN.

547
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:03,561
OH. HE SEEMS... NICE.

548
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,696
OH, COME ON...
COULD YOU BE MORE GENERIC?

549
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:09,567
- DON'T YOU THINK HE'S GORGEOUS?
- HE'S NOT MY TYPE.

550
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,635
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A TYPE.

551
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:15,840
WELL, IF I HAD A TYPE,

552
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,543
HE WOULDN'T BE IT.

553
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,979
THAT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE,
TOM AND MY OTHER GAY FRIENDS

554
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,280
ARE LIKE,
NUTS ABOUT BEN.

555
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,950
I DON'T GET "NUTS"
ABOUT MANY MEN...

556
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,820
BUT THAT'S
JUST MY OPINION.

557
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:34,191
YOU KNOW I TRUST YOUR OPINION.
IF YOU SAID TO ME,

558
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,760
"HEY, SAM, I DON'T THINK
BEN'S RIGHT FOR YOU,"

559
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,830
- I'D LISTEN.
- YOU WOULD?
 ( gargling )

560
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,899
OF COURSE.
I WOULD TELL YOU

561
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:44,602
IF I THOUGHT A GUY
WAS WRONG FOR YOU.

562
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:47,571
I WOULD TELL YOU IF I THOUGHT
SOMEONE WAS RIGHT FOR YOU,

563
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,707
LIKE TOM.

564
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,911
YOU TWO WERE
SO ADORABLE TOGETHER!

565
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,148
SO, DID YOU HAVE FUN
AFTER WE LEFT?

566
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,819
OH, COME ON,
DON'T BE SO SHY.

567
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,787
I KNEW YOU GUYS
WOULD HIT IT OFF.

568
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:07,024
UH--I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE
KISS AND TELL TYPES.

569
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,561
OH, COME ON.
DON'T BE SUCH A PRUDE!

570
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,633
PARKER, CAN YOU
HAND ME THE SHAMPOO?

571
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:27,878
WELL... YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT BROUGHT UP TOM!

572
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,690
HEY, MATT,
ABOUT LAST NIGHT--

573
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:43,093
MAJOR SCENE LAST NIGHT--
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE!

574
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:47,665
- LAST NIGHT WAS A MISTAKE--
- I HAVE A SECRET!

575
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,700
I KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THERE.

576
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,304
LISTEN, PARKER,
YOU'LL COME OUT
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

577
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:59,209
AND WHEN YOU DO,
IT'LL BE THE MOST AWESOME
DAY OF YOUR LIFE.

578
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,644
BUT...

579
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:01,979
BUT-BUT-BUT...

580
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:04,715
UNTIL THEN,
DON'T WORRY, I KNOW.

581
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,283
IT WON'T LEAVE...

582
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:15,092
...THIS ROOM.
IT WILL NOT
LEAVE THIS ROOM!

583
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:27,972
OOH! WATCH YOUR HEAD,
WATCH YOUR HEAD!

584
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,885
BABY, I SMELL SOME GOSSIP.

585
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,855
I SMELL BIG FAT,
STINKY, JUICY GOSSIP.

586
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,358
TROY, MY FRIEND,
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

587
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,409
PARKER, I'M NOT GOING TO PRETEND
TO BE YOUR BOYFRIEND.

588
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:08,712
I HAVE TO CONVINCE SAM
I'M DATING SOMEONE ELSE,

589
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,315
OTHERWISE I WON'T HAVE AN EXCUSE
NOT TO GO OUT WITH TOM.

590
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,851
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
MY BOYFRIEND, JUST ONE DATE.

591
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:15,953
PARKER, I AM NOT GOING
ON A DATE WITH YOU!

592
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,188
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
A REAL DATE!

593
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,790
JUST COME BY,
PICK ME UP,

594
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:22,059
AND WE'LL...
GO TO YOUR PLACE.

595
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,927
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL SAM THE TRUTH?

596
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:28,365
JACK, PLEASE,
I REALLY NEED THIS.

597
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:32,936
- What's wrong with Tom?
- NOTHING! TOM'S A GREAT GUY--

598
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,307
HE SOUNDS LIKE
A HELLUVA CATCH!

599
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:42,746
JACK, I'LL MAKE IT
WORTH YOUR WHILE.

600
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:48,786
- GO, GIRL! OW!
- WHOO-HOO! YES...

601
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:54,258
- JACK?
- PARKER, NO!

602
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,360
NOT ONLY "NO," HELL NO!

603
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:59,430
NOT ONLY, "HELL NO,"
NOT IN A MILLION YEARS, NO!

604
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,075
BORIS! COME IN.

605
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,143
HELLO, TO YOU, PARKER.
I AM BROUGHT YOU

606
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,412
BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS TODAY
AND I HOPE YOU LIKE!

607
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:20,484
WHO THIS WOMAN SO BEAUTIFUL TO
MY EYES WHAT I AM SEEING TODAY?

608
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:23,821
HI, I'M SAM,
PARKER'S ROOMMATE.

609
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:28,025
WHAT A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU
ON THIS VERY WELL-ROUNDED DAY

610
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,060
FOR ME TO SEE YOU!

611
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,901
BORIS, DO YOU MIND
IF I STEAL PARKER AWAY

612
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,437
FOR JUST A MINUTE?

613
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,406
NYET! NO, NO...

614
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:46,043
JUST DON'T STEAL
FROM BORIS! HA HA!

615
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:53,050
- HERE.
- WHAT'S THIS FOR?

616
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,486
I BORROWED SOME CHANGE
FOR LAUNDRY.

617
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,855
YOU DO THE LAUNDRY,
I CAN AT LEAST PAY FOR IT.

618
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:00,524
BUT YOU WALK BARNEY 
FOR ME ALL THE TIME.

619
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:04,928
BARNEY WALKS ME.
GIVE HIM THE TEN BUCKS.

620
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:09,867
SO, ARE YOU NERVOUS?

621
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,441
A LITTLE.

622
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,012
ARE THOSE FAKE?

623
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:37,594
UH... VERY NICE,
UM... PICTURES.

624
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,631
IN OUR COUNTRY,
WE CALL THEM

625
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:42,866
"PAINTINGS."

626
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:48,605
- "PANTIES?"
- NO, PAIN-TINGS.

627
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:53,977
- PAN-TIES.
- PAIN-TINGS.

628
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,516
- PAIN ... TIES...
- WE GOTTA GO.

629
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,654
WHAT IS THE LARGE RUSH?
I AM TALKING WITH SAM
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

630
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:06,857
8:30 RESERVATIONS.
WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE OUR TABLE.

631
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:11,428
YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD DINNER.
IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU, BORIS.

632
00:47:11,461 --> 00:47:14,331
IT'S AN ENORMOUS,
LARGE VERY GOOD
PLEASURE FOR ME

633
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:17,000
AND I'M LOOKING VERY
FORWARD TO THE NEXT
TIME I EAT YOU.

634
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,410
THAT IS WHAT WE CALL
IN MY COUNTRY,

635
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,512
"FROM RUSSIA,
WITH LOVE."

636
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,451
FUCKING FOREIGNERS!

637
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:37,654
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE KISSING ME!

638
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,357
LADIES FIRST,
MY GAY CABALLERO.

639
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:45,696
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN!
- PARKER, SHE IS AMAZING!

640
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,664
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF HER!

641
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,434
I MADE MY BED
AND NOW I'M LYING IN IT.

642
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,170
DID YOU EVER THINK OF MAKING
HER BED AND LYING IN THAT?

643
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:57,040
SHE'S GOT A BOYFRIEND.

644
00:47:57,074 --> 00:48:01,044
SO, PARKER,
EVERYONE IS AVAILABLE!

645
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:03,380
AND I MEAN, EVERYONE!

646
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:04,948
C'MON, I'LL BUY YOU
A PIZZA.

647
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,985
THEN, WE CAN GO SOMEWHERE
AND MAKE OUT.

648
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,691
THIS HAS GOT TO BE
THE MOST ROMANTIC PLACE

649
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,526
IN ALL OF MANHATTAN.

650
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,562
OUT OF ALL THE BOYS
IN THE CITY...

651
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:22,099
- YOU PICKED ME.
- ISN'T THAT SPECIAL?

652
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,969
HEY! CHECK THAT OUT, PARK.

653
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,504
YOU LIKE CARROT CAKE?

654
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:30,073
OH, NEVER MIND,
TAKE A NUMBER.

655
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,976
THAT'S BEN!

656
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,313
- BEN WHO?
- SAM'S BEN!

657
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:41,451
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT GUY I DIDN'T LIKE!

658
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,719
LET'S NOT JUMP 
TO CONCLUSIONS.

659
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,621
MAYBE IT'S HIS SISTER.

660
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,259
MAYBE IT'S
HIS STEP-SISTER...

661
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:54,197
FROM ARKANSAS.

662
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,433
THIS IS GOING TO
BREAK SAM'S HEART.

663
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,036
YOU COULD TELL HER.

664
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,575
- HI.
- HI.

665
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,611
SO, ARE YOU IN LOVE?

666
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:14,084
LET'S JUST SAY,
I FEEL LIKE I'VE KNOWN
BORIS FOR YEARS.

667
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,120
PARKER,
THAT'S WONDERFUL!

668
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:20,490
HE'S SEXY...

669
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:23,160
IN A UNITED NATIONS
KIND OF WAY.

670
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,462
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

671
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:28,598
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY YOU CAN'T
GO OUT WITH BORIS AND TOM.

672
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,535
GIVE THEM BOTH A CHANCE.

673
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:35,372
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
I'M JUST... I'M KIND OF...

674
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:37,107
OLD-FASHIONED.

675
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:47,250
BESIDES, HOW WOULD
YOU FEEL IF, SAY...

676
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:51,121
BEN WAS SEEING YOU...

677
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:54,091
AND SOMEONE ELSE
AT THE SAME TIME?

678
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:58,128
OH, PARKER,
I THINK WE'RE
A LITTLE BEYOND THAT STAGE.

679
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:03,233
- SAM?
- YEAH?

680
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,571
DON'T TAKE THIS
PERSONALLY, BUT, UH...

681
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,412
YOU EVER FINISHED
ONE OF THOSE?

682
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:23,520
PICASSO SAID,
"A PAINTING IS NEVER FINISHED."

683
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:29,092
NO... BUT I WILL.

684
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,133
WHAT EXACTLY
ARE YOU PAINTING?

685
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:41,538
IT'S AN ABSTRACT
OF LOLITA AND BARNEY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

686
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,680
IT'S A LITTLE
TOO ABSTRACT.

687
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:56,887
GOOD! 'CAUSE THAT MEANS
I CAN JUST PAINT RIGHT OVER IT.

688
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,189
THAT'S THE GREAT THING
ABOUT PAINTING,

689
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:02,659
IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING,
JUST PAINT OVER IT
AND START FRESH.

690
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,431
COME HERE,
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

691
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:13,370
TA-DA!

692
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:17,107
I THOUGHT YOU COULD
USE SOME INSPIRATION...

693
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:20,710
THE ARTICLE STILL HAD
THE DATE ON TOP,

694
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:24,214
SO I CALLED YOUR HOMETOWN PAPER
AND REQUESTED ANOTHER COPY.

695
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,149
HERE'S THE REST
OF THE PAPER.

696
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:29,119
THERE WAS SOME REALLY
COOL STUFF THAT WAS
GOING ON HERE---

697
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:44,167
CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE KEPT YOU
FROM PURSUING YOUR DREAM,

698
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:49,172
BUT NOW YOU'RE GOING
TO GET BACK ON TRACK!

699
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:58,248
WHY CAN'T MEN
JUST BE HONEST?

700
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,183
YEAH, IF THEY'RE
INTERESTED,

701
00:52:00,217 --> 00:52:04,254
WHY DON'T THEY JUST COME ON OUT
AND SAY, "HEY, I'M INTERESTED"?

702
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,256
EXACTLY-- AND NOT
CONCOCT SOME BIG LIE...

703
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:09,326
- JUST TO GET OUR PHONE NUMBER.
- YEAH, AND NEVER CALL.

704
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,361
LOSERS.

705
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,966
IT'S NO NEWSFLASH,
BUT REJECTION SUCKS.

706
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,968
YEAH, BUT IF YOU LIE,

707
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:20,303
YOU'RE GONNA GET CAUGHT
SOMETIME,

708
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,506
SO WHAT'S THE POINT?

709
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:25,942
MEN ARE JUST
GIANT ARTICHOKES.

710
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:30,547
THEY'RE PRICKLY
AND HAIRY AND HARD

711
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,583
UNTIL YOU GET
TO THE HEART...

712
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,220
WHICH IS THE BEST PART.

713
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,626
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GAY?

714
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,930
Sam:
HE IS SWEET, ISN'T HE?

715
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,232
YOU EVER HAD
YOUR ASS WAXED?

716
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:55,839
DID I MENTION,
SAM'S FRIEND KATE
SORT OF HIT ON ME THE OTHER DAY?

717
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,408
OH, THAT MAKES SENSE...
"TURN GAY, ATTRACT WOMEN."

718
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:04,281
YOU KNOW, IT'S WEIRD.
EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN "GAY,"

719
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,617
I'VE FELT MORE COMFORTABLE
AROUND WOMEN THAN EVER.

720
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:09,753
OF COURSE, YOU'VE GOT
NOTHING AT STAKE.

721
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:12,422
YOU'RE JUST WAITING FOR SAM
AND HER BOYFRIEND TO BREAK UP.

722
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:15,425
'TIL THEN, NO OTHER WOMAN
IN THE WORLD EXISTS FOR YOU.

723
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,827
THAT IS SO NOT TRUE!

724
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:20,664
OH, YEAH?
WHAT'D YOU THINK OF HER?

725
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:25,335
- WHO?
- I REST MY CASE.

726
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:29,906
WOULD YOU LIGHT SOME
CANDLES FOR AMBIENCE?

727
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,443
- SURE.
-
BEN'S ON HIS WAY OVER.

728
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,312
( knock at door )

729
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:37,280
THAT'S BEN.
WOULD YOU GET THAT,

730
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:39,049
AND TELL HIM I'LL BE
OUT IN A MINUTE?

731
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,384
ONLY IF I CAN
UNLEASH THE ANIMALS.

732
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,620
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP!

733
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,288
I'LL LET HIM IN!

734
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:47,757
WHEN I LET HIM IN,
YOU BITE HIM!

735
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:49,793
RIP HIS HEAD OFF!

736
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:53,830
( whispering )
READY, WHEN I LET HIM IN,
YOU BITE HIM. COME ON!

737
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:56,366
( dog barking )

738
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,468
COME ON, YEAH COME ON!
GET HIM! GO!

739
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:03,840
HEY, PARK.
WHERE YOU GOING?

740
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:06,343
WHERE'S MY GIRL?

741
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:09,746
SHE'S PUTTING THE FINISHING
TOUCHES ON HER MAKE-UP.

742
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:13,450
WOMEN... BUT I GUESS YOU
DON'T HAVE THAT HASSLE, HUH?.

743
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:18,321
SO, DO ALL THE WOMEN
THAT YOU DATE

744
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,490
TAKE A LONG TIME
WITH THEIR MAKE-UP?

745
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:23,593
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I SAW YOU WITH THAT GIRL.

746
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:27,364
- OH, YOU MEAN...
- DON'T EVEN!

747
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:31,434
YOU DIDN'T TELL SAM, DID YOU?

748
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:33,403
NO, THAT'S YOUR JOB.

749
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,338
THIS IS GOING TO HURT HER.

750
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:40,443
NO, YOU ALREADY HURT HER,
SHE JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT YET.

751
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,915
I KNOW, BUT I'VE GOT THIS
THING FOR BLONDES, YOU KNOW.

752
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,851
SHE WAS A REDHEAD.

753
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,993
WAIT A MINUTE...
"MR. INNOCENT."

754
00:54:57,027 --> 00:55:00,764
YOU DON'T THINK I SEE
THE WAY YOU LOOK AT HER?

755
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,600
YOU MAY HAVE HER FOOLED BY THIS
LITTLE CHARADE OF YOURS...

756
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,404
BUT I KNOW!

757
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,442
KNOW WHAT?

758
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:16,046
YOU'RE... BISEXUAL.

759
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:18,982
WHAT!?

760
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:23,453
DON'T YOU EVEN THINK
ABOUT TURNING THIS AROUND

761
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:27,691
WHEN YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW---

762
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:30,994
WHAT ARE YOU TWO GETTING
SO INTENSE ABOUT?

763
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,963
- FOOTBALL.
- BASEBALL.

764
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,799
- BASEBALL.
- FOOTBALL...

765
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,667
SPORTS.

766
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,503
PARKER, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE INTO SPORTS.

767
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,606
OH SURE, I MEAN,
ALL THOSE GUYS TOGETHER

768
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:48,178
WITH THEIR TIGHT, MUSCULAR,
COLORFUL UNIFORMS?

769
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:49,813
WE SHOULD GO.

770
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,449
WHY? I THOUGHT WE'D
HANG OUT HERE FOR AWHILE.

771
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:54,784
YEAH, BUT I'M
REALLY HUNGRY...

772
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,454
YEAH, BEN'S GOT
QUITE THE... "APPETITE."

773
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,690
IT SEEMS I'M NOT
THE ONLY ONE.

774
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,197
PARKER, DO YOU WANT
TO JOIN US?

775
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,532
OH NO, I...

776
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,201
UH... I ATE.

777
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:16,439
BUT I THINK YOU AND BEN HAVE
A LOT TO TALK ABOUT, PROBABLY.

778
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,476
LET'S GO.

779
00:56:21,144 --> 00:56:22,879
- BYE.
- BYE.

780
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,620
BISEXUAL?!

781
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:35,158
( glass breaking )

782
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:38,194
SAM?

783
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,032
SAM?

784
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,603
SHIT!

785
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:48,605
SAM, NO!
YOU'LL CUT YOUR FINGERS!

786
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,707
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET A GLASS OF WINE.

787
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,447
( sighs )

788
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,917
OH, PARKER!

789
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:07,190
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

790
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:10,260
YOU KNEW!
YOU KNEW ALL ALONG!

791
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,162
KNEW WHAT?

792
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:14,030
YOU KNEW BEN WASN'T
RIGHT FOR ME,

793
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:16,599
YOU NEVER SAID SO,
BUT YOU KNEW.

794
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,271
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

795
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,973
PARKER, HE'S BEEN
SEEING OTHER WOMEN!

796
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:27,911
OH, I'M SORRY.

797
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:34,250
GOD, WHAT A WAY
TO FIND OUT.

798
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:38,555
- HOW DID YOU FIND OUT?
- HE TOLD ME!

799
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:47,030
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE SHIT ALSO SAYS HE HAS
TO GO AWAY FOR A YEAR!

800
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:49,132
WHY?

801
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:51,534
FOR BUSINESS.

802
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:54,604
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WORSE?

803
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,106
HE'S GOING TO PARIS!

804
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,847
AND HE'S NOT TAKING ME!

805
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,216
HE DIDN'T EVEN
ASK ME TO GO.

806
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:11,020
HE SAID HE LOVED ME
BUT NOT IN AN EXCLUSIVE WAY.

807
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:13,790
WHAT THE HELL
KIND OF LOVE IS THAT?

808
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:18,661
IT'S A SELFISH
KIND OF LOVE.

809
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,766
PARKER, WHY DO MEN
HAVE TO LIE?

810
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:28,638
OH, I DON'T KNOW...

811
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,573
I THINK
SOMETIMES 'CAUSE...

812
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:34,344
THE TRUTH HURTS.

813
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:38,014
THE TRUTH ONLY HURTS
WHEN IT FOLLOWS A LIE.

814
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:45,188
♪ DRY YOUR EYES, I'M HERE NOW

815
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:49,826

00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,895

NO.

818
00:58:56,065 --> 00:59:00,737
- CAN I ASK YOU A FAVOR?
- YEAH, ANYTHING.

819
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:05,708
CAN I SLEEP WITH YOU?

820
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:13,683
I DON'T MEAN LIKE THAT.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE.

821
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,352
OKAY.

822
00:59:18,254 --> 00:59:20,356
THANKS, YOU'RE THE BEST.

823
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,142
ARE YOU OKAY?

824
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:43,746
I'M OKAY. IT JUST
HURTS A LITTLE BIT.

825
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:52,689
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT
USED TO SLEEPING
WITH GIRLS, HUH?

826
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:57,393
- MY SISTER.
- YOUR SISTER?

827
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:02,265
YEAH, MY PARENTS, THEY USED
TO ARGUE ALL THE TIME.

828
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:06,669
SO I'D RUN DOWN THE HALL
AND JUMP IN BED WITH HER.

829
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:10,273
SHE'D TELL ME
TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOW

830
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:13,876
AND COUNT ALL THE STARS AND THEN
EVERYTHING WOULD BE OKAY.

831
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,647
WAS IT...
OKAY?

832
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:23,753
I'D FALL ASLEEP BEFORE
I COUNTED ALL THE STARS.

833
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:32,295

01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:55,852
YEAH, I DO.

838
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:17,473
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
YOU SLEPT TOGETHER, ALL NIGHT,

839
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:21,844
IN THE SAME BED, SIDE BY SIDE,
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED, RIGHT?

840
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:24,480
NOTHING PHYSICAL,
JUST SPIRITUAL.

841

844
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:38,528
YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE GAY.

845
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:42,231
A BEAUTIFUL, WONDERFUL WOMAN
ACTUALLY TRUSTS ME.

846
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:44,267
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

847
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,336
YEAH, IF YOU'RE A PRIEST.

01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,911
LOOK AT THAT.

849
01:01:57,146 --> 01:02:01,551
OH MY GOD... WHOO,
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

850
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:03,820
PARKER, ARE YOU HOME?

851
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:10,426
- HI!
-
HI.

852
01:02:11,527 --> 01:02:14,530
YOU'RE READING
THAT OLD MAGAZINE AGAIN?

853
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:19,869
I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR LAST NIGHT.

854
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,306
ANYTIME.

855
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:26,509
IT WAS JUST REALLY
SWEET OF YOU TO
PUT UP WITH ME.

856
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:32,915
( laughing and dog barking )

857
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:42,091
- WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA TONIGHT?
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

858
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:44,961
A LITTLE MILES DAVIS
AND A QUART OF BEN & JERRY'S.

859
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:47,830
NO, NO, NO... WE ARE
GOING OUT TONIGHT!

860
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:49,599
OH, NO, NOT TONIGHT.

861
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,901
C'MON,
IT'S HALLOWEEN!

862
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,970
C'MON, WHAT SOUNDS
LIKE FUN?

863
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:57,140
WELL...

864
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:01,844
KATE AND HOLLY ARE GOING
TO TOM'S HALLOWEEN PARTY.

865
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:07,917
SURE! THAT SOUNDS GREAT!
LET'S GO.

866
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,887
( techno music )

867
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:39,482
I LOOK LIKE MY MOTHER!

868
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:42,518
NO, ACTUALLY, YOU LOOK
LIKE YOUR FATHER.

869
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:46,055
ANYBODY GOT A LIGHT?

870
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:49,058
OH MY GOD... TOM?
I ALMOST DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU!

871
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:52,995
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
I DRESS LIKE A GIANT BUTT!

872
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:55,331
HEY, WHERE'S PARKER?

873
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:59,168
YOU'RE LOOKING AT HER.
ISN'T SHE CUTE?

874
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:05,141
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE
A FRUIT SALAD!  RUFF!

875
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,083
HEY, DANCE WITH ME!
EXCUSE US!

876
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:20,456
- I THINK YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.
- THANK YOU!

877
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:23,159
WE'RE GOING TO GO
GET A DRINK...

878
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:27,530
FIRST YOU'RE DATING MEN,
NOW YOU'RE WEARING DRESSES.

879
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:30,066
WHAT'S NEXT,
BREAST IMPLANTS?

880
01:04:31,067 --> 01:04:34,070
WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE,
A VILLAGE PERSON?

881
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:36,706
BORIS LIKE TOOL.

882
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:40,643
NICE PUMPS.
WHERE'D YOU FIND
A SIZE THAT FIT YOU?

883
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:42,478
SAM'S EX-ROOMMATE.

884
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:45,915
I THOUGHT SHE JUST
HAD GUYS AS ROOMMATES.

885
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:49,919
...OH.

886
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:01,397
WOW...
HE CAN DANCE.

887
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:06,102
- HEY, GUYS!
- HELLO, SAM!.

888
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:10,373
BORIS! THIS IS TOM.

889
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:14,610
TOM, THIS IS BORIS.

890
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,716
VILLAGE PEOPLE-- CLEVER.

891
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,985
BORIS, WHY DON'T
YOU GIVE TOM

892
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:25,988
ONE OF YOUR SPECIAL
RUSSIAN GREETINGS?

893
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:27,256
I GO GET A WODKA.

894
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,029
LATER, GIRLS.

895
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,167
I GUESS IT'S JUST
US CROSS-DRESSERS.

896
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,403
I GUESS.

897
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,571
GIVE ME ONE OF THOSE!

898
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,241
( "Hot, Hot, Hot" plays )

899
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:48,110
C'MON YOU GUYS,
JOIN IN THE FUN!

900
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:10,099
I HAVE GOT
TO GET THESE OFF!

901
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:11,801
GOD, TELL ME
ABOUT IT.

902
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:14,103
I'VE GOT TO TAKE
THIS LEASH OFF!

903
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:23,279
YOU KNOW, PARKER, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO WALK ME HOME.

904
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,149
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO STAY WITH BORIS.

905
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:31,620
OH, I THINK BORIS HAD
HIS EYES ON SOMEONE ELSE.

906
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:33,356
I HATE TO
SAY THIS, PARKER,

907
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:35,524
BUT I THINK BORIS
IS A HUGE FLAKE.

908
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,793
YOU COULD DO
A LOT BETTER.

909
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:41,097
( Billy Paul's
"Me and Mrs. Jones" plays )

910
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,164
I KNOW.

911
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,702
SPEAKING OF HUGE FLAKES,

912
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:50,072
HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN
SO WRONG ABOUT BEN?

913
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:57,079
SOMETIMES WITH THE PEOPLE
THAT WE'RE ATTRACTED TO,

914
01:06:57,113 --> 01:07:00,216
WE ONLY SEE
THE GOOD THINGS.

915
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:05,287
I KNOW, JUST WHY DO I ALWAYS
FALL FOR THE "HALF-PEOPLE"?

916
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:08,524
YOU KNOW, THE GUY WHO'S
MARRIED TO HIS WORK;

917
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:11,460
THE GUY WHO'S COMMITTED
TO SOMEONE ELSE;

918
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:15,064
THE GUY WHO JUST NEEDS
TO BE COMMITTED.

919
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:21,203
BLAME IT ON YOUR PARENTS,
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES.

920
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:27,109
WHAT WERE YOUR PARENTS LIKE,
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP?

921
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:38,521
GROWING UP... I WAS DEFINITELY
DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL.

922
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:43,592
ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T KNOW IT.
HE WASN'T AROUND MUCH.

923
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,466
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
WHERE WAS HE?

924
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:56,338
WHEN I WAS 14, HE TOOK OFF
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN,

925
01:07:56,372 --> 01:08:00,543
YOU KNOW, LEFT ME AND MY MOM
FEELING PRETTY UNWANTED.

926
01:08:05,548 --> 01:08:07,116
I COULD IMAGINE...

927
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:13,155
THAT'S GOTTA HURT.

928
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:15,624
YEAH.

929
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:19,161
I JUST REALIZED IF I DIDN'T
INVEST TOO MUCH EMOTION

930
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:22,164
IN ANY ONE THING,
I COULDN'T GET

931
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,433
TOO BADLY HURT IF
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

932
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,471
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
THE DIVORCE

933
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,873
DIDN'T MAKE ME
A GREAT FINISHER.

934
01:08:32,575 --> 01:08:34,710
WELL, YOU'RE GREAT
AT EVERYTHING ELSE.

935
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,214
- C'MON!
- WHAT?

936
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:51,727
YOU LEAD.

937
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,364
I THINK IT'S LIKE THIS.

938
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:08,644
( record skipping )

939
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,950
WHAT IS IT WITH YOU
AND THESE WORN-OUT RECORDS?

940
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,353
WHAT'S WRONG WITH CDs?

941
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:22,391
I DON'T KNOW--
SOMETHING ABOUT THE SOUND.
IT TRANSFORMS ME.

942
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:27,363
SOMETHING ABOUT THE NEEDLE
AGAINST THE VINYL.

943
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:31,834
IT'S ALL THAT... CONTACT.

944
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,445
- WHAT ARE WE DOING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

945
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:50,519
- YOU KNOW, WE SHOULDN'T.
- I KNOW.

946
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,458
PARKER, ARE YOU REALLY
ATTRACTED TO ME?

947
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:58,360
OR IS THIS JUST
TO GET BACK AT BORIS?

948
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:01,263
BORIS IS THE FARTHEST THING
FROM MY MIND.

949
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:11,840
IS THIS TO GET BACK AT BEN?

950
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,376
WHO'S BEN?

951
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,500
SEE SOMETHING UNUSUAL?

952
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:40,669
WHAT, A WOMAN IN MY BED?

953
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:43,739
THIS IS MY BED.

954
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,342
OH, RIGHT.

955
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:54,683
I HAD A FANTASTIC TIME
LAST NIGHT.

956
01:10:56,418 --> 01:11:00,689
ME, TOO. IT WAS JUST
FULL OF SURPRISES.

957
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:03,926
DRESS UP LIKE A MAN AND YOU
NEVER KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN.

958
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:09,431
- HOW DRUNK WERE WE?
- NOT THAT DRUNK.

959
01:11:11,367 --> 01:11:15,070
IS THIS WHAT THEY CALL
A ONE-NIGHT STAND?

960
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,573
THAT ONLY APPLIES
TO STRANGERS.

961
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:20,809
I'M GUESSING YOU FELT
STRANGER THAN I DID.

962
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:25,314
ACTUALLY, IT FELT
PERFECTLY NATURAL.

963
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:31,987
I HOPE THIS
WASN'T A MISTAKE.

964
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:38,794
THERE'S ONLY ONE
SURE WAY TO FIND OUT.

965
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:45,501
( giggles )

966
01:11:50,673 --> 01:11:52,474
WAIT!

967
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:57,413
I CAN'T STAY VERY LONG.
I GOTTA GOT TO WORK TODAY.

968
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:03,085
SO, DID YOU HAVE FUN
LAST NIGHT?

969
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:05,487
YEAH, I GOT HIT ON
ABOUT 20 TIMES,

970
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:10,726
EVEN BY A WOMAN.
AT LEAST I THINK IT WAS A WOMAN.

971
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,462
HOW ABOUT YOU?

972
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:37,019
YOU GOT LAID!

973
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:43,025
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
THEY HEARD YOU IN BROOKLYN.

974
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:48,497
I DIDN'T GET LAID...
I MADE IT UP.

975
01:12:54,503 --> 01:13:00,142
PARKER, YOU KNOW, YOUR AURA
IS SO CLEAR AND SO BRIGHT!

976
01:13:00,175 --> 01:13:03,712
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE FINALLY
REACHING YOUR TRUE GOAL.

977
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:05,414
I DO.

978
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:09,418
- YOU ARE THE BEST!
- ( squeals )

979
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:15,190
HAVE YOU EVER FELT
LIKE YOU'RE INVISIBLE?

980
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,059
ONLY AROUND YOU, KIM!

981
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,797
OKAY, HANDSOME,
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

982
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:25,467
- WHAT'S WHOSE NAME?
- TELL US YOUR BABY DADDY!

983
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:29,571
I HATE TO DISAPPOINT YOU.
FOR ONCE AND FOR ALL,
I AM NOT GAY.

984
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,473
I MET AN AMAZING WOMAN.

985
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:33,242
YOU ARE SUCH
THE QUEEN OF DENIAL!

986
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:36,145
- C'MON, WE'RE UNDERSTANDING...
- NO, WE'LL PLAY ALONG.

987
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,614
WHAT'S "HER" NAME--
STEVE?

988
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:41,583
- OR BILLY?
- OH, BILLY!

989
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:46,522
FOR ONCE AND FOR ALL,
YOU GUYS CAN BELIEVE

990
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:48,590
WHAT YOU WANT,
EVERYONE ELSE DOES.

991
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:51,260
- FUN BOY, HAVE IT YOUR WAY.
- IT'S COOL...

992
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:53,262
WHEN YOU'RE
READY THOUGH...

993
01:13:53,295 --> 01:13:55,597
WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO COME OUT THE CLOSET,

994
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:58,600
WE'RE RIGHT THERE FOR YOU, MAN.
YOU CAN TALK TO US.

995
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:01,136
( telephones ringing )

996
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:02,704
OH, YEAH!

997
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:04,606
Into headset:
PSYCHIC PALS HOTLINE...

998
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:13,215
- HOW'S MY FAVORITE ARTISTE?
- GREAT! HOW ABOUT YOU?

999
01:14:24,026 --> 01:14:27,763
- LOOK!
- OH, WOW! MY FAVORITE.

1000
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,798
I THINK YOU HAVE IT
BACKWARDS THOUGH.

1001
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:33,135
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BUY ME DINNER
BEFORE WE SLEEP TOGETHER.

1002
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:35,838
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'M SEXUALLY DYSLEXIC.

1003
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:48,517
OH MY GOD, "WEST SIDE STORY!"
OH, YOU'RE THE BEST!

1004
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:57,125
NO, NOT THE CART AGAIN.

1005
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:00,562

PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS.

TWO BUCKS AND YOU'RE ON.

1020
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:29,384
OKAY, BUT IT
BETTER BE GOOD.

1021
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,720
IT IS GOOD,
ISN'T IT?

1022
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:35,724
OF COURSE...
MOSTLY.

1023
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:39,328
MOSTLY? OKAY, I THINK
I WANT MY MONEY BACK.

1024
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,865
I DON'T KNOW. I'VE JUST...
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

1025
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:47,703
EVERYTHING'S BEEN SO GREAT
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS,

1026
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:50,772
BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE
THE CLOCK'S TICKING.

1027
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:52,941
OH SWEETHEART,
I KNOW WOMEN WORRY

1028
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:55,777
ABOUT THEIR
BIOLOGICAL CLOCKS, BUT--

1029
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:57,779
NOT MINE, YOURS!

1030
01:16:57,813 --> 01:17:00,816
I'VE SEEN IT WITH A LOT
OF MY GAY FRIENDS.

1031
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:03,685
THEY THINK ITS COOL
TO BE WITH A WOMAN,

1032
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:08,156
SATISFY THEIR CURIOSITY,
PLEASE THEIR PARENTS.

1033
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:13,195
THEN NATURE STEPS IN,
AND THEY'RE BACK AT THE BARS.

1034
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:17,032
AND I CAN'T COMPETE
WITH THAT.

1035

TRUST ME,
I KNOW THIS IS RIGHT.

1036
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:27,409
DON'T SAY THAT--
BEN SAID THAT.

WE'LL JUST KEEP DOING
WHAT WE'RE DOING,

1039
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:36,852
BUT THE MOMENT
THIS DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT,

1040
01:17:36,885 --> 01:17:40,055
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
HONEST WITH ME, OKAY?

1041
01:17:40,088 --> 01:17:42,958
AND YOU WITH ME.

1047
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:04,246
BECAUSE?

1048
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:08,517
BECAUSE SOMEBODY
HAS A NEW HONEY.

1049
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,819
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE...

1050
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:14,256
AND YOU TREATED ME
LIKE I WAS FROM VENUS.

1051
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:18,794
MEN ARE FROM MARS,
WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS.

1052
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:55,530
LOOK, PARKER,
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR WRITERS,

1053
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:59,501
I'M LOOKING FOR IDEAS...
IDEAS WITH HEART.

1054
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:02,337
IF YOU PITCH ME
A GREAT IDEA WITH HEART,

01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,939
YOU GET TO WRITE IT.

1056
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:07,375
THAT'S THE WONDERFUL
WORLD OF FREELANCE.

I DON'T KNOW,
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR.

1060
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:22,424
WELL, YOU CAN'T WRITE IT
IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT ENDS.

1061
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:25,360
JOURNALISM 101.

1062
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:27,896
I GUESS I MISSED
CLASS THAT DAY.

1063
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:32,300
YOU MUST OF MISSED

01:19:37,205 --> 01:19:39,074
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO.

1066
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:41,943
YOU BRING ME AN ENDING,
AND WE'LL TALK.

1067
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,003
IS UNCLE CHARLIE'S
STILL A GAY BAR?

1068
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:10,906
IS THE POPE STILL CATHOLIC?

1069
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:14,342
OKAY, STUPID QUESTION.

1070
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:16,545
I DON'T KNOW.

1071
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:18,647
DID YOU GET TOM'S OPINION
ON ALL OF THIS?

1072
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:23,051
YEAH, AND HE KNOWS LOTS OF GAY
GUYS WHO'VE SLEPT WITH WOMEN.

1073
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:25,887
AND?

1074
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:30,859
AND...A LEOPARD DOESN'T
CHANGE ITS SPOTS.

1075
01:20:31,927 --> 01:20:33,995
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

1076
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:39,367
- HELP ME.
- I WISH I COULD.

1077
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:42,604
CALL A PSYCHIC!

1078
01:20:43,972 --> 01:20:46,007
YEAH, RIGHT...

1079
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:49,678
( congested )
HER NAME IS SUE.

1080
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:52,480
SHE'S HAVING BOYFRIEND PROBLEMS.
YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

1081
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:55,951
ACHOO!

1082
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,986
I'M SORRY.
THANKS, HOLD THAT FOR ME.

1083
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:01,223

1084
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:11,199
Into telephone:
HI, SUE? 
THIS IS... NORMAN.

1085
01:21:11,233 --> 01:21:17,038
I SENSE YOU HAVE
ROMANTIC PROBLEMS...

1086
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:20,008
Female voice:
Yeah, Norman, I do.

1087
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,579
AND YOU'RE AT A CROSSROADS
IN YOUR LIFE.

1088
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:28,250
Well, there was this one guy,
who I really liked

1089
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:30,518
and then I found out
he was seeing other women,

1090
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:33,989
but he moved away, anyway.

1091
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:37,058
Then I started
seeing my friend...

1092
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:41,029
I mean, my roommate--
but there's a problem.

1093
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,298
WHAT'S THAT?

1094
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:46,234
He's gay.

1095
01:21:47,335 --> 01:21:49,404
Well, he was gay.

1096
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:55,110
He's bisexual... I think.

1097
01:21:57,178 --> 01:22:01,650
SUE, WHERE ARE YOU
CALLING FROM?

1098
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:04,753
Well, you tell me.

1099
01:22:04,786 --> 01:22:06,955
NEW YORK CITY?

1100
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:11,459
I'm impressed,
but you might have Caller I.D.

1101
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:16,064
UH, I SENSE ...

1102
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:20,001
A CAT IN YOUR PRESENCE.

1103
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:23,505
- What's her name?
- HER NAME IS ...

1104
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:27,075
IT STARTS WITH
AN...AN "L."

1105
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,144
Close enough.

1106
01:22:29,177 --> 01:22:32,047
TELL ME ABOUT MY BOYFRIEND.

1107
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:35,650
He was never gay.

1108
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:37,686
WHAT?!

1109
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:42,691
WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
HE ALWAYS PRETENDED

1110
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:47,796
TO BE SOMEONE HE WASN'T BECAUSE
HE NEVER FELT COMFORTABLE

1111
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:51,199
WITH WHO HE WAS,
UNTIL YOU CAME INTO HIS LIFE.

1112
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:54,069
You mean I made him straight?

1113
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:56,538
YEAH, YOU COULD SAY
YOU STRAIGHTENED HIM OUT.

1114
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:04,112
WELL, I MEAN,
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER GUY?

1115
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:07,115
WHO AM I SUPPOSED
TO TRULY BE WITH?

1116
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:13,121
THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION
WILL BE RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU,

1117
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:16,624
BUT YOUR HAPPINESS
WILL ONLY COME

1118
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:19,694
WITH YOUR ABILITY
TO FORGIVE.

1119
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:24,099
He's right in front of you.

1120
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:27,068
All you have to do
is open your eyes.

1121
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:39,147
SUE?

1122
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:42,617
SAM? SAM? SAM?!

1123
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:51,493
- COVER FOR ME! WILL YOU?
- YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

1124
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:02,837

1125
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,673
PARKER, IS THAT YOU?

1126
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:21,356

01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:23,258
SURE.

1128
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:27,862
- HOW'S PARIS, BEN?
- FINE, THANKS FOR ASKING.

1129
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,898
WOMEN TREATING YOU WELL?

1130
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:32,100
GUESS I SHOULD
ASK YOU THE SAME.

1131
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:41,142
BEN, I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

1132
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:56,257
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

1133
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:02,797
PARKER, WHO'S "K?"

1134
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:04,933
KEVIN? KYLE?

1135
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:08,269
- KIM.
- KIM.

1136
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:11,840
THAT'S AN ODD NAME FOR A MAN.
IS HE CHINESE?

1137
01:25:11,873 --> 01:25:13,675
KIM'S A WOMAN.

1138
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:17,612
YOU MET A WOMAN
AT UNCLE CHARLIE'S?

1139
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:21,182
I'VE NEVER BEEN
TO UNCLE CHARLIE'S.

1140
01:25:21,216 --> 01:25:24,185
KIM'S A WOMAN FROM WORK.

1141
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:27,255
SHE PROBABLY GOT THE MATCHES
FROM ONE OF THE GUYS--

1142
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:29,324
THE GAY GUYS AT WORK.

1143
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:36,631
SAM...

1144
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:44,839
I HAVE A
CONFESSION TO MAKE.

1145
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:50,645
I'M NOT...

1146
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:55,850
I'M NOT IN TELEPHONE SALES.

1147
01:25:57,685 --> 01:26:00,221
I WORK FOR
THE PSYCHIC PALS NETWORK.

1148
01:26:00,255 --> 01:26:02,590
I'M NORMAN.

1149
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:13,801
BUT I DON'T HAVE
ANY PSYCHIC POWERS.

1150
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:17,272
IT'S A STUPID JOB!

1151
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:21,276
I DIDN'T TELL YOU THE TRUTH
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT YOU

1152
01:26:21,309 --> 01:26:24,612
TO THINK I WAS SOME SORT
OF FLAKE OR SOME SORT OF FREAK.

1153
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:26,681
YOU LIED TO ME?

1154
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:32,754
LOOK, NOTHING EVER
HAPPENED WITH KIM.

1155
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:38,026
I BELIEVE NOTHING
HAPPENED WITH KIM...

1156
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:42,463
FOR THE SAME REASON THAT
I BELIEVE WE HAVE NO FUTURE...

1157
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:46,234
BECAUSE YOU'RE GAY, PARKER!

1158
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:52,373
I'M NOT GAY!

1159
01:26:54,842 --> 01:26:57,445
I'VE NEVER BEEN GAY.

1160
01:26:57,478 --> 01:26:59,948
I ONLY SAID THAT
SO YOU'D RENT ME THE ROOM.

1161
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:03,651
YOU SEE...

1162
01:27:05,887 --> 01:27:07,789
EVER SINCE I BOUGHT
THAT PUMPKIN...

1163
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:12,427
I'VE KNOWN THAT I'VE BEEN
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

1164
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:16,731
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU.

1165
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:22,036
I'VE NEVER KNOWN
HOW TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

1166
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:28,276
BORIS?

1167
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:33,414
JACK.
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

1168
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:44,392
I TRUSTED YOU.
I CARED ABOUT YOU.

1169
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:49,797
I LOVED YOU.

1170
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:54,335
DON'T!

1171
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:57,372
DON'T BE HERE
WHEN I GET BACK!

1172
01:27:57,405 --> 01:27:59,641
LEAVE ME ALONE!

1173
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:10,084
LOOK, WALTER, I CAN'T PREDICT
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA FIND

1174
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:13,788
THE WOMAN OF YOUR DREAMS.
IF I DID, I'D DO IT MYSELF!

1175
01:28:15,823 --> 01:28:17,425
( wrapper crinkling )

1176
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:19,093
UH, THERE SEEMS TO BE
SOME STATIC, WALTER.

1177
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:21,763
I'LL HAVE TO
PUT YOU ON HOLD.

1178
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:22,897
HI.

1179
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:26,734
I'M WATCHING YOU, CONCORDE.

1180
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:37,412
WELL, IT SEEMS TO BE
ALL BETTER NOW.

1181
01:28:38,946 --> 01:28:41,049
YOU KNOW, WALTER?

1182
01:28:43,117 --> 01:28:45,787
I CAN TELL YOU THIS FOR SURE.

1183
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:48,790
IF YOU MEET
THE WOMAN OF YOUR DREAMS,

1184
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,792

WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

1260
01:33:47,154 --> 01:33:50,157
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR HURTING SAM,

1261
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:52,727
AND FOR NOT BEING
STRAIGHT WITH YOU.

1262
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,296
THAT'S JUST IT,
YOU WERE STRAIGHT WITH ME!

1263
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:01,035
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,
YOU WERE THE BEST DATE
I'D HAD IN MONTHS!

1264
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:03,270

1269
01:34:28,062 --> 01:34:31,098
I FOUND A NEW ROOMMATE--
BARNEY.

1270
01:34:31,132 --> 01:34:33,868
- SAM'S DOG?
- YEAH.

1271
01:34:34,835 --> 01:34:36,804

YOU WERE ALLERGIC.
