00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,669
It's a test of life and death ...

00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:05,270
The test of courage,

5
00:01:05,312 --> 00:01:07,872
the will and pain.

6
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,813

Jackson just sent the Hammer
back to the floor.

27
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:22,344
All Jackson has done here
is to exploit hip.

28
00:03:22,382 --> 00:03:24,316
He wants to give him over the head

29
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,751
if this situation is to escape criticism.

30
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,861

32
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:41,866
Hammer hitting him on the ground.

33
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:45,633
What happens?
Jackson gathered his inner strength.

34
00:03:48,642 --> 00:03:50,234
The referee is blocked.

35
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:53,337
Wolf Jackson wins by knockout.

36
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,780
What incredible turn of events.

37
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:59,876

Just put the floor on one
of the best fighters in MMA.

40
00:04:04,524 --> 00:04:07,915
That is, Stan. Wolf Jackson is one
of the most promising fighters

41
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,825

00:04:17,637 --> 00:04:20,538
And that struggle written all over years

46
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:23,202
when talking about Isandro,
talk of a kind

47
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:25,404
whose life story reads
as a script in Hollywood.

48
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:27,413
When he was only 14 years
was already involved

49
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,347
in the streets of his homeland,
Argentina.

50
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:32,943
He became the youngest world champion
mixed martial arts history.

51
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:35,113
We speak of a kind
who do not yet tasted defeat.

52
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:38,056

Wolf, can you tell us your thoughts
struggle?

55
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:47,991
How could such a return
in the fourth round?

56
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:50,502
Hammer is good fighter,
but unfortunately,

57
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:52,505
have fought a good guy tonight ...
with me.

58
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:55,099
Someone has to give a lesson type.

59
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:57,803
Do not worry about it.

60
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:02,338
Tell us what is for you.

61
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:04,646
I tell you what follows.
I want the title.

62
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:06,709

He's way to the ring.

65
00:05:15,395 --> 00:05:17,158
I want to fight with this man ... Isandro.

66
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:20,325
- Isandro, Isandro, Isandro.
- What? I will go down.

67
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:23,131
- Low. Accept the challenge.
- To do it.

68
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,330
You will be challenged.
You will be broken.

69
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:27,602
- S do.
- I agree.

70
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:38,345
You promised me that it was over,
I'll walk away from this shit.

71
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:40,353
Just one more fight.

72
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:42,855
Wolf has long wanted a piece of me.

73
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,254
I will give him a chance.

74
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,282
Why? to come home to me
face torn

75
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:48,851
or head end, or worse?

76
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,920
Look, this deal saved my life, right?

77
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:52,591
He taught me self-esteem.

78
00:05:52,632 --> 00:05:54,600
In fact, if I'm going to retire,

79
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:56,568
to teach the torch in the ring.

80
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:58,571
We still owe a fight.

81
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:01,870
Ray, Ray, hello,

82
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:04,399

00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:06,378
I will make a fortune the next battle.

84
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:08,711
Even if we do lose a fortune.

85
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:11,478
Your confidence is overwhelming.

86
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:15,420
Come on, kid. You only fighter

Sure. It's a pleasure.

108
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,936
Listen, I want to pass on the office
Wednesday.

109
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:08,304
The guys at Nagano Investments
want to make an action movie

110
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:09,865
to be broadcast only on mobile phones

111
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:12,776

Are you interested?

112
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:15,747

114
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:20,513
How about, come Wednesday?

115
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:22,783
You bet.

116
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:25,952
Come home, Ray.

117
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:29,325
Here, May is one thing
you should do.

118
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:31,227
You must arrange things
in order to Wolf.

119
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:33,494
- What, are you crazy?
- Not now.

120
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:35,558
It will take just a moment.

121
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:42,632
Isandro.

122
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:44,370
What?

123
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,643
Good job.

124
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:55,847
And you did a good job, buddy.

125
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,290
Oh, you were both great.
I've almost convinced.

126
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:00,849
You know, become better.

127
00:08:00,894 --> 00:08:03,454
Not already handed Oscars.

128
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:04,929
Approaching a fight.

129
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:06,795
Need to feel hatred.
Hate sells tickets.

130
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,360
No problem. You have to ask you something.

131
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:12,098
I hate to do it.

132
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:14,231
What?

133
00:08:14,274 --> 00:08:16,139
Can I have your autograph
for my boy?

134
00:08:16,176 -> 00:08:18,144
- My autograph?
- Your autograph.

135
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:19,645
She loves you, man.

136
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,169
You have to be hurt.

137
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:24,615
Believe me, I have no idea.

138
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:27,916
Here, lad.

139
00:08:47,207 --> 00:08:49,232
In honor of your love.

140
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:58,642
You think I have beautiful eyes?

141
00:08:58,685 -> 00:09:01,984
If you think you have beautiful eyes?

142
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:06,522
Where did all these questions
crazy?

143
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,620
Just ask.

144
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:13,723
Well?

145
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:15,791
I do not know. I never ever seen.

146
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:17,803
You are such an asshole.

147
00:09:17,837 --> 00:09:20,601
Come here. You gonna learn to dance samba.

148
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,608
Samba? There are tango dancer.

149
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,701
No, no, no, that I learned

150
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:26,712
- Well, look at that.
- Okay.

151
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:29,044
Do so.

152
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:30,549
One, two,

153
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,711
and third, I spin it.

154
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:35,778
So. I can see again?

155
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:37,084
Steps?

156
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:39,318
No, no, that little twist
you made it.

157
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:40,826
- Twist?
- Yes.

158
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,555
So.

159
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:44,426
You want to do that?

160
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:45,954
- Stop.
- No answer.

161
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,830
- Do not answer the phone.
- You must respond.

162
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:50,529
Hello.

163
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,594

164
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:54,539
Gus, what do you want?

165
00:09:54,574 --> 00:09:57,008
I just received a call from someone

166
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:59,978

167
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:03,540

This is fantastic.

170
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:10,753
- Come on.
- Kidding.

171
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,087
No, seriously.

172
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,649

173
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:14,955

How?

178
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:24,200
In this and following my
second fight,

179
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:26,603
not we should be worried about money.

180
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,766
You said you have still a struggle.

181
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:32,300
No, no, no, I said
still struggle with Wolf.

182
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:34,575
- Yes.
- After fighting withdrawal in Vegas.

183
00:10:34,614 --> 00:10:39,278
- No, no, not what you said.
- I owe him that.

184
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:41,844
Look, I think perhaps the two struggles,

185
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:45,324
That's then and I will withdraw

186
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:49,294
and we can do anything you want.

187
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:52,730
We can dance all day if you want.

188
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:57,836
And then this is?

189
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,998
And you leave forever?

190
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,306
Are you the only thing in this world

191
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:07,677
What really counts for me.

192
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,344
So what do you think?

193
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,080
What do I think?

194
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:19,114
Yes, what do you think?

195
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:24,018
Want to know what I think?

196
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:29,364
I ...

197
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:34,499
that trouble you, sir.

198
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:05,450
What is love?

199
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:08,392
I think I saw someone at the window.

200
00:14:08,427 --> 00:14:10,156
On the roof?

201
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,391
Perhaps a child.

202
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:14,956
Should call the police?

203
00:14:19,372 --> 00:14:22,136
- Where are you going?
- In the next room,

204
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:23,506
the phone.

205
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:24,840
Well, I come?

206
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:28,404
No, wrong. Stay here.

207
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:52,861
What the hell is happening?

208
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,071
Honey, where is your phone?

209
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:58,576
It's in the bag, where they always leave.

210
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:37,839
Run, run, run.

211
00:15:37,883 --> 00:15:39,111
- Ray!
- Kira!

212
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:40,880
- Move it, move out.
- Ray.

213
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,785
Let's go.

214
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:44,915
Kira!

215
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:01,463
Ray, help me!

216
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:13,546
Ray.

217
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:18,183
You understand the idea, boxeorule.

218
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:21,551
Do not fight with fists against weapons.

219
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:48,482
If you could see the look on his face.

220
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:53,652
Calm down, calm down.
Nobody gonna hurt,

221
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:55,160
if you cooperate.

222
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:59,861
You know what I mean?

223
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:02,026
Comprende?

224
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:04,901
Want to move than the head

225
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:07,371
to know that you understand

226
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:09,533
fucking English?

227
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:16,347
Bravo.

228
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:18,850
Now I know, communicate.

229
00:17:18,884 --> 00:17:21,546
Lift it.

230
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,318
96 beats per minute ... impressive.

231
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,160
Someone we do not like very much.

232
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:33,597
I am sure you are confused
about this.

233
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:35,600
I will explain.

234
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:38,034
Follow me.

235
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:46,409
Jesus, look at that?

236
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:52,283
You are a very lucky man.

237
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:58,056
You want to see it.

238
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:06,355
Jesus.

239
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:16,907
Lift it.

240
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:33,352
I just injected your wife

241
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:35,485
a small capsule.

242
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:37,496
This capsule contains

243
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,862
a very powerful neuro-toxin,

244
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:41,958
very deadly.

245
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:43,969
In a few days to start

246
00:18:44,003 --> 00:18:46,665
to dissolve in its blood flow

247
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:48,673
and one to be hurt.

248
00:18:48,707 --> 00:18:52,165
And then it will be increasingly worse

249
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,907
and then die.

250
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:57,415
Bastard, why do you want? Money?

251
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,385
Money?

252
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,785
No, no, you do not want money.

253
00:19:02,822 --> 00:19:04,790
You know what I want.

254
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:06,792
Do not suggest

255
00:19:06,826 -> 00:19:09,818
to go to the police.

256
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:11,693
It's only one antidote to this,

257
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,664
so I keep him with us.

258
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,724
What?

259
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:17,633
It will be our little secret.

260
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,297
Good luck.

261
00:19:19,338 --> 00:19:21,704
Bon chance.

262
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:31,676
Take care.

263
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:44,419
Help me!

264
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:02,612
I knew someone would come.
I know that you are you.

265
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:04,809
Wolf, what are you doing here?

266
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,715
Sorry.

267
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:40,911
Wolf, what the hell is wrong with you?
Why do this?

268
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:43,114
They took the boy.
They say it kills.

269
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:45,214
- Who?
- Fight with me.

270
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:47,191
Listen, you find him, I promise.

271
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:50,093
Not one of us must die.

272
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:51,926
We can not kill between us, okay?

273
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:53,090
That's the only chance you have a son.

274
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:55,157
Fight with me. Be.

275
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,830
Are you a better fighter than me.
You should kill me for my boy.

276
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:31,927
No.

277
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:34,439
You should kill me for my boy.

278
00:21:34,473 --> 00:21:36,805
You must kill me.

279
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:53,018
Kill me.

280
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:05,870
Bravo.

281
00:22:05,904 --> 00:22:07,496
I removed his hat.

282
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:10,235
I saw some ugly fighting in my life,

283
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:12,004
but this surpassed them.

284
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:17,174
Easy, easy, easy.

285
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:21,316
I will not be the only one who dies
tonight.

286
00:22:21,353 --> 00:22:24,481
I would remember this, if I were you.

287
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:26,616
Congratulations.

288
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:29,492
You passed the first round.

289
00:22:29,528 --> 00:22:31,519
You know, the next two days

290
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:33,360
you will fight

291
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:36,562
with some of the greatest fighters
martial arts world.

292
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:39,002
The rules are ...

293
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:42,804
Well, I'm not rules.

294
00:22:42,841 --> 00:22:44,809
Each fighter has to fight,

295
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:47,471
and each must fight
until death,

296
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:49,208
without exception.

297
00:22:49,248 --> 00:22:50,806
What happens if I lose?

298
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:53,340
If you lose, you die honorably

299
00:22:53,385 --> 00:22:54,784
and your friends and family

300
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,685
will be arranged for your life.

301
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:58,189
What does that mean?

302
00:22:58,223 --> 00:23:02,683
It means he will receive the sum of 5 million.

303
00:23:02,728 --> 00:23:05,162
So see?
Are not so bad.

304
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:07,097
But if you cheat,

305
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:09,600
or fail to behave honorably,

306
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:11,603
will be killed

307
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:14,071
and they will not receive anything.

308
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:15,539
Who the hell are you?

309
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:18,168
Who the hell are they?

310
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,838
My name ...

311
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:23,541
s Ivan Mikhailov,

312
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:25,209
for you.

313
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,717
What you get from this?

314
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:28,845
These fights are broadcast live

315
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:32,448
to certain privileged individuals
worldwide.

316
00:23:32,491 --> 00:23:34,220
No need to say,

317
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:37,422
make large bets that the gentlemen.

318
00:23:37,463 --> 00:23:39,658
So this is a show for the rich?

319
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:43,156
In a manner of speaking.
But it is much more than that.

320
00:23:43,202 --> 00:23:46,035
It is an opportunity that you did not receive a

321
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:48,062
in 100 lives.

322
00:23:48,107 --> 00:23:50,598
This happens when the world is,

323
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:53,110
the sand Coliseum

324
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:56,546
until today.
And you, my friend ...

325
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:58,880
You were born for this.

326
00:23:58,917 --> 00:24:00,908
I saw anger

327
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:04,320
of you waking up.

328
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:07,848
No one is really alive

329
00:24:07,893 --> 00:24:12,421
until death face to face.

330
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:14,125
You were killing

331
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:18,466
like a duck to water.

332
00:24:18,504 --> 00:24:19,937
Bravo.

333
00:24:19,972 --> 00:24:22,805
Welcome.

334
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:26,743
Now we belong.

335
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:46,397
Kira.

336
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:49,691
Kira.

337
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,100
Kira, darling.

338
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:57,233
Thank God you are alive.
I did not know if they ...

339
00:24:57,276 --> 00:25:00,803
I feel terrible.
Why are they doing this?

340
00:25:00,846 --> 00:25:03,314
I do not know.

341
00:25:03,348 --> 00:25:05,976
Going to die, Ray?

342
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:07,645
No, you die.

343
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:11,178
I will call my coach.
We will go to the hospital.

344
00:25:11,223 --> 00:25:12,884
He knows more about medicine.

345
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:15,860
No.

346
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:23,994
What's this?

347
00:25:24,036 --> 00:25:26,163
Just follow me.

348
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:28,673
I will not I let these people
to hurt you.

349
00:25:28,707 --> 00:25:30,436
I promise you that, baby.

350
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:16,910
Eat this time, kid.

351
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:11,509
What?

352
00:27:11,543 --> 00:27:13,841
Nothing.

353
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:15,904
I'm fine.

354
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:22,776
You must go.

355
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:25,016
You choose.

356
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:29,555
What is this, Rainerio?

357
00:27:29,594 --> 00:27:33,052
I wonder

358
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:35,726
who will have to kill next.

359
00:27:57,889 --> 00:27:59,880
Hello, sir Isandro.

360
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:01,893
My name is Anka.

361
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:03,895
I will look after you

362
00:28:03,929 --> 00:28:05,988
in preparing your match tonight.

363
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:09,091
Can I offer something refreshing?

364
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:11,466
Why am I here?

365
00:28:11,503 --> 00:28:14,438
Mr. Mikhailov me informed

366
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:17,465
that's a very important meeting
this tonight.

367
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:19,841
You will be treated

368
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:23,006
with any pleasure you could want.

369
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:25,346
Hello.

370
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:36,124
I am here to make you feel
comfortable as possible.

371
00:28:39,898 --> 00:28:43,595
I can help you feel great,

372
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:48,072
Turn to your deepest desires
and passions

373
00:28:48,106 --> 00:28:51,906
body and mind.

374
00:28:56,381 --> 00:28:58,178
What about my wife?

375
00:28:58,216 --> 00:29:00,377
You have a chance to start a new life with us.

376
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,046
I love my life as e.

377
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:04,055
Winner of the fight
I will give

378
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:05,852
over 30 million

379
00:29:05,891 --> 00:29:08,416
and could choose to have us all
that company

380
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,825
until enough of us.

381
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:12,125
I do not think you will tire of me, Rainerio.

382
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,791
Believe me, Rain.

383
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:19,929
- I trust everyone.
- It hurts.

384
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:22,201
Why not finish the crap

385
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,640
and tell me what you really?

386
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:26,974
As you wish.

387
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:43,486
You must be very in love

388
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:46,361
to reject you, dear.

389
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:23,093
I can stay with failure,

390
00:30:23,135 --> 00:30:26,627
dredges.

391
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:28,502
Clean garbage.

392
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,565
Prepare it for battle.

393
00:31:20,258 --> 00:31:22,283
I heard that you killed the Wolf.

394
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:27,287
Look, we both
together, OK?

395
00:31:27,332 --> 00:31:29,766
Same and you've told Wolf
before you kill him?

396
00:32:13,245 --> 00:32:16,112
I will kill you, Rain.
They took family.

397
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,821
I will kill you, Ray.

398
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:01,767
All right. You have only dreamed.

399
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:04,502
- I dream?
- Yes, all right.

400
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:09,336
- How ama get here?
- I brought her here.

401
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,248
I thought you were dead.

402
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:16,253
I have to go before I call
to fight again.

403
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:19,450
to find out who is behind
all of them.

404
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:21,459
Ivan can not do this alone.

405
00:36:21,493 --> 00:36:23,256
It must be someone
you all know it.

406
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:26,923
If they return? If you looking for?

407
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,294
We seek at all times.

408
00:36:31,336 --> 00:36:33,201
Follow me on me.

409
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:38,434
I will find a way to protect yourself.

410
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:50,016
Fights Galaxy Incorporated,

411
00:36:50,054 --> 00:36:51,851
struggle to make you,
number one.

412
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,154
Gentlemen, welcome to the family.

413
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:55,887
Welcome to the future of MMA.

414
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:58,122
You will not be disappointed, believe me.

415
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:00,426
Go. Take a look at this.

416
00:37:00,465 --> 00:37:02,228
Look at them.

417
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:04,792
- Rainerio, how are you?
- Not too good.

418
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:07,168
Okay, okay, okay,
why not come on here?

419
00:37:07,205 --> 00:37:08,433
What happens?

420
00:37:08,473 --> 00:37:10,373
We hope to be able to respond
this question.

421
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:11,875
- What do you mean?
- Have you ever heard

422
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,207
a guy named Ivan Mikhailov?

423
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:15,542
- Yes. Why?
- Last night I was wracked house

424
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,105
of a group of trained assassins.
My wife was injected

425
00:37:18,149 --> 00:37:19,741
with a time bomb that will kill.

426
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:21,615
Jesus, who the hell is that?

427
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:23,985
Bring it here. You learn together
who do this, right?

428
00:37:24,022 --> 00:37:26,490
I know what will.
You were the police?

429
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:30,392
I can not. I can go to the police.

430
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:32,760
I need to know who do that.

431
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:36,563
I think that whoever is in power,
has serious ties to the military.

432
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:38,398
I do not know anyone of that kind.

433
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:40,461
Someone trying to get into MMA.

434
00:37:40,505 --> 00:37:43,030
Everyone wants a piece of the Galaxy.
You know that.

435
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:44,905
But, come on, otăviri, right?

436
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:47,275
Blackmail, murder? You know what?

437
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:49,371
We need to calm down.

438
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:51,780
Let's finish this.
You are very angry.

439
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:55,684
The hell that is. And it should be, too.

440
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,120
When did you last talked with Wolf?

441
00:37:58,156 --> 00:37:59,623
Probably there in Vegas.

442
00:37:59,657 --> 00:38:01,955
Well, is dead.

443
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:03,187
What?

444
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:06,128
I was forced to kill
each other.

445
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:16,269
Left, right, strike.
Left, right, strike.

446
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:18,172
That's right, now knees.

447
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:21,645
Left knee, right.
must be seriously hit.

448
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:24,079
Must have a fucking party time.

449
00:38:24,115 --> 00:38:25,480
What the hell are you talking about?

450
00:38:25,516 --> 00:38:27,575
What the hell do you mean speak?

451
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:29,143
You smoking drugs or something?

452
00:38:29,187 --> 00:38:31,417
Biggest battle is coming
Your Career

453
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:32,980
and nobody knows where you were.

454
00:38:33,024 --> 00:38:35,151
You did not answer the phone no.

455
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:37,753
Do not you ever trained
over two weeks.

456
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:39,786
A lot of shit happened.

457
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:41,389
I was worried for you.

458
00:38:41,432 --> 00:38:43,229
You must go hell out of here.
Are you into trouble.

459
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:45,633
- Are you kidding?
- I look a fool?

460
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,195
- Jesus.
- Look, it forces me to fight me.

461
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,207
Kira will kill, if he will.

462
00:38:54,846 --> 00:38:57,440
What do you do? What?

463
00:38:57,482 --> 00:38:58,744
Talk to me.

464
00:38:58,783 --> 00:39:00,751
Well, you know everybody
of town.

465
00:39:00,785 --> 00:39:03,117
You must have heard something.

466
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:05,520
I hear some rumors, you know ...

467
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:07,490
some fighters from Russia, Brazil,

468
00:39:07,525 --> 00:39:10,858
a guy named Chang, Lang, Bang ...

469
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:12,021
Kang Lai?

470
00:39:12,063 --> 00:39:13,826
Yes. You know?

471
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:15,833
It must be a master ninja.

472
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:16,993
S good?

473
00:39:17,035 --> 00:39:18,502
They say it best.

474
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:20,868
Find out who are the others.

475
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:22,668
Try to talk to them.
Warns him.

476
00:39:22,707 --> 00:39:25,301
Do what you know, right?
I gotta go now.

477
00:39:25,343 --> 00:39:27,004
How to keep a link?

478
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:29,912
I keep one. You gonna find me.

479
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:31,744
Keep guard up.

480
00:39:31,783 --> 00:39:33,273
Yes and so do you.

481
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:42,351
I said it was Rainerio.

482
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:48,562
He is behind all this.
He has the most to obtain.

483
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,567
But I can not believe that would do that.

484
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:52,569
I mean, Andre,
always has been our friend.

485
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:12,212
Are you awake.

486
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:34,308
The show must continue.

487
00:41:08,646 --> 00:41:10,637
That car should.

488
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,159
Stay here.

489
00:41:24,195 --> 00:41:26,220
Take care.

490
00:41:58,896 --> 00:42:01,421
Andre, what happens?

491
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:02,864
Why do not you tell me?

492
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:16,975
- We need to talk.
- We have what to talk.

493
00:42:42,073 --> 00:42:44,769
Wait. I do not want to fight with you.

494
00:42:46,777 --> 00:42:49,075
Andre, stop.

495
00:42:49,113 --> 00:42:51,104
Please.

496
00:42:51,148 --> 00:42:53,207
Okay?

497
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:55,845
You know I never would have done worse
your brother. You know that.

498
00:42:58,756 --> 00:43:02,089
Andre, hear it, right?
Hear what he said.

499
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:04,458
Kill us all, Sophia.
You understand that?

500
00:43:04,495 --> 00:43:06,929
If he wanted to kill,
Now you were dead.

501
00:43:06,964 --> 00:43:09,933
Is that true? You have nothing to do with that?

502
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:13,596
They poisoned her on Kira. It's dying.

503
00:43:13,638 --> 00:43:16,300
Sorry, man.
I thought it was your fault.

504
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,776
No, it's a guy who had said
Ivan Mikhailov.

505
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:21,607
Yes, I know.

506
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:23,136
What's around the neck?

507
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,114
It's a bomb.

508
00:43:25,149 --> 00:43:26,673
Tie is called Shanghai.

509
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:29,618
If someone tries to give it out,
will fly head.

510
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:31,485
We must stop this.

511
00:43:31,522 --> 00:43:34,218
- What do we do?
- You can go to my house,

512
00:43:34,258 --> 00:43:36,692
to stay there as you want.
You take care of Kira for me.

513
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:39,958
You have to remove it from the neck before
someone to decide it a blow.

514
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:41,965
Look, I do everything I can

515
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:43,296
as to save her and Kira.

516
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,938
- To catch on nemernicii guys.
- No, Andre.

517
00:43:51,976 --> 00:43:54,467
GPS says it's in the building.
Come on.

518
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,307
You have to leave the hell out of here.

519
00:43:57,348 --> 00:43:59,509
Go to my house.
Leave your car here.

520
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:00,676
Listen to him.

521
00:44:06,724 --> 00:44:08,316
Stop.

522
00:44:10,194 --> 00:44:12,890
- Let go.
- Do not tell me twice.

523
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:15,125
Adunci, go.

524
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:16,997
Move it.

525
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,281
Move it, man. Let's go.

526
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:42,586
As before.

527
00:44:44,495 --> 00:44:46,463
Rainerio,

528
00:44:46,497 --> 00:44:50,524
Welcome to your new opponent.

529
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:53,469
Soon you will meet
a great master ninja.

530
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:55,472
Kang Lai.

531
00:44:55,506 --> 00:44:57,565
Good luck.

532
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:39,249
No weapons will be used

533
00:45:39,283 --> 00:45:42,377
to fight it.
You will be disqualified.

534
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:20,150
I was a grandmaster.

535
00:46:20,191 --> 00:46:23,524
It's one thing.

536
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:30,965
This is not a true fighter.

537
00:46:31,001 --> 00:46:33,799
Cost me a lot of money ...

538
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,807
a fortune for most people.

539
00:46:38,242 --> 00:46:40,142
What a disappointment.

540
00:46:40,177 --> 00:46:42,270
Take him away!

541
00:46:42,313 --> 00:46:45,441
It is over.

542
00:46:45,483 --> 00:46:47,178
May not kill anyone for you.

543
00:46:47,218 --> 00:46:49,584
S over?

544
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,814
No, no, no.

545
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:53,221
It's far from over.

546
00:46:53,257 --> 00:46:55,452
Have you forgotten your wife,

547
00:46:55,493 --> 00:46:57,085
your friends?

548
00:46:57,128 --> 00:46:59,096
Even I do not want to kill them,

549
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,995
but I will if you have,

550
00:47:01,031 --> 00:47:03,363
to regain my money.

551
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,599
Take him away!

552
00:47:07,638 --> 00:47:09,868
Yes, sir. Fasten it to the eye.

553
00:47:09,907 --> 00:47:13,206
Close it.
I want him weak and vulnerable

554
00:47:13,244 --> 00:47:15,804
for most of his life fighting.

555
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:17,871
Let's go.

556
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:54,145
He fled.

557
00:47:54,185 --> 00:47:56,983
Where the hell have you been? It's here.

558
00:47:59,623 --> 00:48:01,181
Where is it?

559
00:48:01,225 --> 00:48:04,058
What the hell?

560
00:48:04,094 --> 00:48:05,959
- It's out.
- Damn.

561
00:48:19,276 --> 00:48:22,973
Security guards are outside?

562
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,238
Here it is.

563
00:49:21,272 --> 00:49:23,797
I went here

564
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:28,141
to see if you are satisfied

565
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:31,170
the quality of those fun days.

566
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:34,048
Fun? That you think we here?

567
00:49:34,084 --> 00:49:35,483
Well, no.

568
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,352
What I meant was
that you do here

569
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:41,085
will bring a new respect for MMA.

570
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:43,753
What about Russian?

571
00:49:43,794 --> 00:49:46,957
What about the fucking Russian?

572
00:49:46,997 --> 00:49:49,192
We have a little problem with it.

573
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:51,201
Negotiation never went too far.

574
00:49:51,235 --> 00:49:54,966
It seems not to care what their relatives do.

575
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:57,496
I suggest you simply make an offer.

576
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,337
You know, Russell?

577
00:50:01,378 --> 00:50:04,347
No amount of money worth
to die for it.

578
00:50:04,381 --> 00:50:08,750
You can order a masterpiece.

579
00:50:08,786 --> 00:50:11,152
You need to inspire.

580
00:50:11,188 --> 00:50:13,656
Try again.
Find and weaknesses.

581
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:15,352
That's your gift, is not it?

582
00:50:15,392 --> 00:50:18,054
Try again.

583
00:50:18,095 --> 00:50:20,393
Yes, of course. Sorry.

584
00:50:24,234 --> 00:50:26,065
What happens, Russ?

585
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:28,071
Afraid to get dirty hands?

586
00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:31,734
I just want to tell me
what you do Kira, Ivan.

587
00:50:31,775 --> 00:50:35,836
You know Rainerio not like others.

588
00:50:35,879 --> 00:50:37,938
It may have awakened a sleeping giant.

589
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:42,418
Allow me to worry
the giant.

590
00:51:15,452 --> 00:51:17,545
- Honey.
- God.

591
00:51:17,588 --> 00:51:19,317
God, you scared me.

592
00:51:19,356 --> 00:51:22,018
What have they done.

593
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:24,550
Nothing. I'm fine.

594
00:51:24,595 --> 00:51:27,530
- I'm okay.
- Okay, let us sit.

595
00:51:27,564 --> 00:51:29,532
- Rest, right?
- Can.

596
00:51:29,566 --> 00:51:33,002
Sophia and Andre are here.
Stay here.

597
00:51:33,036 --> 00:51:34,936
I will go for help.

598
00:51:34,972 --> 00:51:36,633
No, you can.

599
00:51:36,673 --> 00:51:39,301
Look, I have to do something.
It's my fault.

600
00:51:39,343 --> 00:51:41,106
If it was for me,
did you have done that.

601
00:51:41,145 --> 00:51:44,080
No, Kira.

602
00:51:44,114 --> 00:51:46,810
Baby.

603
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:49,444
If you would have loved so much,

604
00:51:49,486 --> 00:51:52,819
I would have had reason to keep me fighting.

605
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:54,414
We will find a way.

606
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:58,019
They put poison in me.

607
00:51:58,061 --> 00:52:00,996
I'm dying.
Are all weaker every day.

608
00:52:01,031 --> 00:52:03,295
- Still have time.
- What?

609
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,665
To be in November

610
00:52:05,702 --> 00:52:08,967
and to love one another.

611
00:52:09,006 --> 00:52:11,031
I love you so much.

612
00:53:13,203 --> 00:53:15,933
Andre never came last night.

613
00:53:15,973 --> 00:53:18,305
I can give it.
I have no news from him.

614
00:53:18,342 --> 00:53:19,570
Please, I need to find him.

615
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:20,872
Any idea where to go?

616
00:53:20,911 --> 00:53:22,435
He said he goes to kill Ivan.

617
00:53:22,479 --> 00:53:24,447
If I go back in two hours,

618
00:53:24,481 --> 00:53:26,779
go to the wharf on the island.

619
00:53:26,817 --> 00:53:29,684
I will find you. O to bring aid.

620
00:53:30,687 --> 00:53:32,712
Come here.

621
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:37,590
Wait, slow down.

622
00:53:37,628 --> 00:53:40,529
What, your secretary is about to do 18 years?
What's the rush?

623
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:42,623
Gus, I would like to talk to you now,

624
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,657
but not, I was late
a very important meeting.

625
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:46,794
You will not believe who I came over yesterday.

626
00:53:46,837 --> 00:53:48,498
- Over what?
- Marty Stillwell.

627
00:53:48,539 --> 00:53:50,029
Wonderful. Who the hell is this?

628
00:53:50,073 --> 00:53:52,735
Marty "Two Guns."
Do not you remember Marty?

629
00:53:52,776 --> 00:53:54,403
Wolf's coach Jackson.

630
00:53:54,444 --> 00:53:56,173
Gus, just be busy.

631
00:53:56,213 --> 00:53:58,807
Well, listen, listen.
Wolf never been seen for about 2 days.

632
00:53:58,849 --> 00:54:01,784
- No one ever heard of him.
- Show the nanny's fucking?

633
00:54:01,818 --> 00:54:04,116
No, just that they are worried.
He and Ray have ...

634
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:06,452
Gus, Gus, what do you say?
He's a fighter, right?

635
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:08,651
I am sure that landed in Shangri La

636
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:10,489
with a couple of girls.
I'm sure that's good.

637
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:13,360
You think? That's a relief
to hear you say that.

638
00:54:13,397 --> 00:54:15,490
Because I heard some strange rumors.

639
00:54:15,532 --> 00:54:16,760
What?

640
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,031
I think someone

641
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:22,197
organizing the illegal fights
in the city.

642
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:24,070
Are involved some way with gravity.

643
00:54:24,107 --> 00:54:26,940
- Where did you hear that?
- Not the one in particular,

644
00:54:26,977 --> 00:54:29,969
but I heard a couple rumors
and developed a theory.

645
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:36,277
Guys I've seen Gus and Andre?

646
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,753
No.

647
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:46,225
How many did you say that?

648
00:54:46,263 --> 00:54:47,457
Only you.

649
00:54:47,497 --> 00:54:49,158
Well.

650
00:54:59,076 --> 00:55:03,035
Not in local, sir.
We have found weapons at the gate.

651
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,843
He will return.

652
00:55:07,484 --> 00:55:09,475
Go and collect them all.

653
00:55:26,136 --> 00:55:28,502
Gus.

654
00:55:31,775 --> 00:55:34,335
Gus.

655
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:40,208
Ray.

656
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:41,842
Gus.

657
00:55:44,121 --> 00:55:48,023
Ray, sorry.

658
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:50,891
Freeze.

659
00:55:50,927 --> 00:55:52,485
What happened?

660
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:55,828
Russell betrayed you you ...

661
00:55:55,866 --> 00:55:59,233
all fighters,

662
00:55:59,269 --> 00:56:01,863
jerk.

663
00:56:01,905 --> 00:56:06,001
Take heart in the chest.

664
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:08,511
I promise ...

665
00:56:20,724 --> 00:56:22,055
Sophia, come, come.

666
00:56:25,962 --> 00:56:28,089
- You got everything?
- Yes, yes, come on.

667
00:56:32,235 --> 00:56:33,998
Ivan wants to see you both now.

668
00:56:34,037 --> 00:56:36,597
Okay, go ahead.

669
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:45,574
You sold.

670
00:56:45,615 --> 00:56:46,946
Ray.

671
00:56:46,983 --> 00:56:48,951
How you got for us?
It was worth it?

672
00:56:48,985 --> 00:56:51,044
- Not sure what you mean.
- You know what?

673
00:56:51,088 --> 00:56:53,056
What are you doing?

674
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:56,617
Don 't even think about,
for being president of Galaxy.

675
00:56:59,062 --> 00:57:01,121
Damn.
I just found out

676
00:57:01,164 --> 00:57:03,860
what happens, right?
I tried to help?

677
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,800
- Help me?
- Yes.

678
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:07,895
You made more money
than all the fighters

679
00:57:07,938 --> 00:57:10,406
helping us, dipshit.

680
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,310
Come on.

681
00:57:15,345 --> 00:57:16,937
Good.

682
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:20,279
I wonder if you know how it
in a real fight.

683
00:57:20,317 --> 00:57:21,909
- Leave me the hell alone.
- Shut up.

684
00:57:21,952 --> 00:57:25,217
It was easy to kill Gus, do you?

685
00:57:25,255 --> 00:57:27,382
Where's Andre?

686
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:28,584
How the hell would I know?

687
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:31,116
What the hell do you know?

688
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:34,619
You know, in a fight, you always hit,

689
00:57:34,664 --> 00:57:36,461
no matter how good you are.

690
00:57:38,969 --> 00:57:43,235
And when you hit are those glimpses
white light.

691
00:57:43,273 --> 00:57:46,731
You lose control of the body.

692
00:57:46,777 --> 00:57:48,745
You can not breathe.

693
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:50,906
The arms and legs do not listen.

694
00:57:50,947 --> 00:57:54,246
You want to throw up, but you can not.

695
00:57:56,186 --> 00:57:57,312
You know why?

696
00:57:59,689 --> 00:58:02,123
Good.
Okay, okay, okay.

697
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:04,127
Listen, I tell you everything, right?

698
00:58:04,161 --> 00:58:06,254
I know of Kira.
I did what I was told.

699
00:58:06,296 --> 00:58:07,923
I fucking nothing to do with it, right?

700
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:09,955
I gave only the fighters, that's all,
I swear.

701
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,127
You only have given fighters?
You gave more than that.

702
00:58:12,169 --> 00:58:14,467
You gave our lives.
Why?

703
00:58:14,504 --> 00:58:16,131
I gave them only information.

704
00:58:16,173 --> 00:58:18,698
Supposed to be my friend.

705
00:58:18,742 --> 00:58:20,471
You have cheated.

706
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:23,707
I had no fucking choice.
Guy is a fucking maniac ...

707
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,211
You know, Gus was my friend.

708
00:58:32,255 --> 00:58:34,223
I had no choice.

709
00:58:34,257 --> 00:58:36,122
We all have a choice.

710
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:39,993
I have made the choice.

711
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:42,692
Please Rain.
I beg hell. Please.

712
00:58:42,732 --> 00:58:45,223
See you in hell, you piece of shit.

713
00:58:59,216 --> 00:59:01,411
Also I have no word from Andre.

714
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:04,113
I hope that has not forgotten responsible ...

715
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:07,123
Wait a minute.

716
00:59:07,157 --> 00:59:09,387
Russell, where were you? I was ...

717
00:59:09,426 --> 00:59:10,723
Russell is not it, today.

718
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,694
Mr Isandro.

719
00:59:12,729 --> 00:59:15,823
I want to meet. I want to talk.

720
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:17,356
Yes, of course.

721
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,494
<i> I would do something on the run.
Once I have your wife </ i>

722
00:59:20,537 --> 00:59:22,630
<i> and sister of Andre. </ i>

723
00:59:22,672 --> 00:59:24,606
I want to talk to my wife.

724
00:59:24,641 --> 00:59:26,734
I will send you instructions

725
00:59:26,776 --> 00:59:28,175
<i> where we meet. </ i>

726
00:59:28,211 --> 00:59:31,271
And to bring her.

727
00:59:35,285 --> 00:59:38,880
Prepare it the Shaman.
Issues in one hours.

728
00:59:40,873 --> 00:59:42,124
<i> NIGHT FIGHT </ i>

729
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:44,835
<i> PARI </ i>

730
00:59:44,895 --> 00:59:47,864
Good evening, everyone,

731
00:59:47,898 --> 00:59:51,595
and welcome to the struggle of life ...

732
00:59:51,635 --> 00:59:55,696
Shaman against Rainerio Isandro.

733
00:59:55,739 --> 00:59:57,866
I'm sure you will not be disappointed

734
00:59:57,908 --> 00:59:59,876
of this great game,

735
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:03,073
of these great fighters.

736
01:00:07,774 --> 01:00:10,486
You are pigs they are sent
slaughter him?

737
01:01:47,717 --> 01:01:49,685
Come on.

738
01:03:10,533 --> 01:03:13,900
Congratulations,

739
01:03:13,937 --> 01:03:16,599
Mr Isandro.

740
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:18,470
It was wonderful,

741
01:03:18,508 --> 01:03:21,272
a great show
My investors,

742
01:03:21,311 --> 01:03:25,407
really equal to one of the great battles

743
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:27,916
of ancient Coloseum.

744
01:03:27,951 --> 01:03:30,146
You promised that we could talk.

745
01:03:30,186 --> 01:03:32,154
Discussions are to diplomats,

746
01:03:32,188 --> 01:03:34,986
not men of action
like you and me.

747
01:03:35,024 --> 01:03:37,151
In a few days, Kira will die.

748
01:03:37,193 --> 01:03:39,627
Then everything will end for me.

749
01:03:39,662 --> 01:03:41,892
I will tell you

750
01:03:41,931 --> 01:03:45,924
when it ends!

751
01:03:47,303 --> 01:03:49,362
Your next fight will be tomorrow morning

752
01:03:49,405 --> 01:03:51,373
very early.

753
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:54,137
And because you were such a great warrior,

754
01:03:54,177 --> 01:03:55,838
give you an opportunity

755
01:03:55,879 --> 01:03:58,439
to see your beloved wife

756
01:03:58,481 --> 01:04:01,314
one last time.

757
01:04:29,312 --> 01:04:31,507
- Rain.
- You okay?

758
01:04:31,548 --> 01:04:33,880
Perfect.

759
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:37,915
It never disappoint me, sir Isandro.

760
01:04:37,954 --> 01:04:41,720
I would hang on chain
if I were you.

761
01:04:41,758 --> 01:04:44,818
But I suspect they already know it, is not it?

762
01:04:46,129 --> 01:04:48,962
A small ingenious construction,
do not you think?

763
01:04:48,998 --> 01:04:51,023
I designed it myself.

764
01:04:51,067 --> 01:04:53,365
That you determine

765
01:04:53,403 --> 01:04:58,238
what kind of man you really are.

766
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:02,173
If I let go of it,

767
01:05:02,212 --> 01:05:05,670
Your precious little

768
01:05:05,715 --> 01:05:07,683
will be sliced

769
01:05:07,717 --> 01:05:09,810
as a ripe grapefruit.

770
01:05:11,721 --> 01:05:15,748
Keep your energy, sir Isandro.

771
01:05:15,792 --> 01:05:18,522
You'll need it.
You fight

772
01:05:18,561 --> 01:05:21,155
the first hours of the morning,
after sunrise.

773
01:05:21,197 --> 01:05:24,064
I

774
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,193
that might be knowing your opponent.

775
01:05:26,236 --> 01:05:29,205
His name is Andre.

776
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:33,141
I think you are old friends.

777
01:05:33,176 --> 01:05:35,906
There are nothing but a coward.

778
01:05:35,945 --> 01:05:40,541
You paid a lot of blood, sir Isandro.

779
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:41,880
I do not judge me.

780
01:05:41,918 --> 01:05:44,216
I do not judge you.

781
01:05:44,254 --> 01:05:47,690
I will rip your heart

782
01:05:47,724 --> 01:05:49,385
I promise.

783
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:54,419
So I want.

784
01:05:56,366 --> 01:06:00,700
We'll see how you feel

785
01:06:00,737 --> 01:06:03,729
tomorrow morning

786
01:06:03,773 --> 01:06:06,173
after sunrise.

787
01:06:08,544 --> 01:06:10,944
Audience increase

788
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,948
every day.

789
01:06:12,982 --> 01:06:16,645
Last night we collected 75 million
with Shaman.

790
01:06:16,686 --> 01:06:18,244
Tomorrow will be even more.

791
01:06:18,288 --> 01:06:20,586
Buenas noches,

792
01:06:20,623 --> 01:06:23,421
Isandro señor.

793
01:06:29,632 --> 01:06:31,964
All right.

794
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:33,229
Go ahead.

795
01:06:33,269 --> 01:06:34,759
- Yes.
- Yes.

796
01:06:34,804 --> 01:06:37,034
I will not let you die.

797
01:06:37,073 --> 01:06:39,564
Stay here with me.

798
01:06:46,516 --> 01:06:49,542
Can I ask a personal question?

799
01:06:49,585 --> 01:06:54,113
How close are you
and your brother?

800
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:57,854
It is doing everything to save
sweet sister?

801
01:06:57,894 --> 01:07:00,658
My brother never cared not
by anyone except him.

802
01:07:00,697 --> 01:07:04,360
I do not care if you find or not.

803
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,994
I think that will pick you seek.

804
01:07:07,036 --> 01:07:09,561
However, if you fail to fulfill

805
01:07:09,605 --> 01:07:12,768
obligations that war ...

806
01:07:16,346 --> 01:07:18,246
Hold it. Keep one foot.

807
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:22,677
Where is it?

808
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:24,243
I do not know.

809
01:07:26,022 --> 01:07:28,513
I thought he would say something.

810
01:07:28,558 --> 01:07:30,492
Where is it? Where is it?
Not remembering yet?

811
01:07:30,526 -> 01:07:32,756
I hope to find me dead

812
01:07:32,795 --> 01:07:36,060
and hope that you will break
that the garbage you are.

813
01:07:36,099 --> 01:07:38,090
It would be great sin

814
01:07:38,134 --> 01:07:41,160
miss the great fight of your life.

815
01:07:41,204 --> 01:07:43,172
You think your brother has a chance

816
01:07:43,206 --> 01:07:45,231
Rainerio before him?

817
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:47,902
Dumb fuck
Rainerio is like his brother.

818
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:49,673
They will fight.

819
01:07:49,712 --> 01:07:51,509
Wrong.

820
01:07:51,547 --> 01:07:53,344
Rainerio will do everything

821
01:07:53,383 --> 01:07:56,079
to and protect
on his precious little girl, Kira.

822
01:07:56,119 --> 01:07:57,677
Bet on it.

823
01:08:07,163 --> 01:08:10,223
Listen carefully, my dear.

824
01:08:10,266 --> 01:08:13,895
The fun has just begun.

825
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:19,339
Do not lose your head.

826
01:08:22,445 --> 01:08:24,470
Andre!

827
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:55,375
Let me die, Rain.

828
01:08:55,411 --> 01:08:57,675
No, never.

829
01:08:58,815 --> 01:09:01,784
I must say
that 's very surprised

830
01:09:01,818 --> 01:09:04,480
to see you here.

831
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,455
Love. He conquers all.

832
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:10,789
Or is hatred? Love-hate,
love-hate, how is it?

833
01:09:10,827 --> 01:09:12,818
Clean it.

834
01:09:12,862 --> 01:09:14,830
Prepare it for battle.

835
01:09:14,864 --> 01:09:16,764
Take him away.

836
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:18,790
Come on.

837
01:09:26,576 --> 01:09:28,476
Start to like you.

838
01:09:28,511 --> 01:09:30,103
You are a survivor.

839
01:09:30,146 --> 01:09:33,240
Very attractive.

840
01:09:33,282 --> 01:09:35,250
Do not worry about it.

841
01:09:35,284 --> 01:09:37,844
It will end soon.

842
01:09:37,887 --> 01:09:40,117
I ...

843
01:09:40,156 --> 01:09:42,647
as one to take care of you,

844
01:09:42,692 --> 01:09:45,320
whether living

845
01:09:45,361 --> 01:09:49,388
or die ...

846
01:09:49,432 --> 01:09:51,730
love.

847
01:09:51,767 --> 01:09:54,565
Clean it and bring a
in my apartment.

848
01:09:54,604 --> 01:09:56,936
Do it presentable.

849
01:10:18,728 --> 01:10:20,355
Rain, you are?

850
01:10:20,396 --> 01:10:23,524
Jackey, are you okay?

851
01:10:23,566 --> 01:10:25,124
Yes.

852
01:10:28,771 --> 01:10:31,604
Me too.

853
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:33,370
Will be fine.

854
01:10:36,045 --> 01:10:39,811
How we feel?

855
01:10:42,285 --> 01:10:46,051
I must say

856
01:10:46,088 --> 01:10:48,955
you look much, much better.

857
01:10:48,991 --> 01:10:52,449
We decided

858
01:10:52,495 --> 01:10:55,362
keep you alive.

859
01:10:55,398 --> 01:10:57,559
Hungry?

860
01:11:00,002 --> 01:11:01,970
Do not worry.

861
01:11:02,004 --> 01:11:04,097
This is the antidote

862
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:07,803
for neuro toxin, right?

863
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,940
Do not feel guilty.

864
01:11:13,983 --> 01:11:17,146
Everyone has the right to stay alive.

865
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:20,688
Thanks. However good.

866
01:11:20,723 --> 01:11:22,691
Everything's better.

867
01:11:22,725 --> 01:11:25,216
I will be okay now.

868
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:27,593
Hungry?

869
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:29,996
Want to eat something?

870
01:11:30,032 --> 01:11:32,899
I know you hate me, but that does not mean

871
01:11:32,935 --> 01:11:35,403
they must hate me food.

872
01:11:35,438 --> 01:11:38,271
In substance, it's just food.

873
01:11:43,913 --> 01:11:47,542
I could not refrain from noticing you.

874
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:50,484
I know that everything will be fine.

875
01:11:50,519 --> 01:11:53,511
I will have staff look after you

876
01:11:53,556 --> 01:11:56,252
after your husband dies.

877
01:11:56,292 --> 01:12:00,126
Please let us go.

878
01:12:00,162 --> 01:12:03,222
Things in life

879
01:12:03,265 --> 01:12:07,861
not necessarily go as you wish.

880
01:12:09,905 --> 01:12:12,897
People live, people die.

881
01:12:12,942 --> 01:12:17,311
Life goes on.

882
01:12:17,346 --> 01:12:18,745
See?

883
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:22,114
I understand that there are only
a strange little crazy.

884
01:12:22,151 --> 01:12:26,815
I look like a guy

885
01:12:26,856 --> 01:12:29,518
giving everyone a chance?

886
01:12:29,558 --> 01:12:31,992
I will fuck you.

887
01:12:32,028 --> 01:12:33,996
And after you shoot one,

888
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:36,828
you sing a different song.

889
01:12:38,668 --> 01:12:41,398
They are more male
than your husband ever will.

890
01:12:47,777 --> 01:12:51,304
Okay, sorry.

891
01:12:51,347 --> 01:12:53,474
Understand,

892
01:12:53,516 --> 01:12:56,144
even understand.

893
01:12:56,185 --> 01:12:58,619
Not bad.

894
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:03,015
I know how to choose a winner ...

895
01:13:08,998 --> 01:13:11,796
not jealous that you a fag.

896
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:14,496
- You ...
- Let me.

897
01:13:14,537 --> 01:13:17,005
You need a lesson in manners.

898
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:21,032
I thought that one should tolerate more,

899
01:13:21,077 --> 01:13:23,272
but you are shy, is not it?

900
01:13:23,312 --> 01:13:25,803
That's good.

901
01:13:25,848 --> 01:13:27,816
It will be fun.

902
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:29,442
Sir, are ready to fight room.

903
01:13:32,521 --> 01:13:34,614
Too bad.

904
01:13:34,657 --> 01:13:37,751
I will finish this later.

905
01:13:41,497 --> 01:13:43,590
I will go to see your husband

906
01:13:43,632 --> 01:13:45,862
As will be killed.

907
01:13:45,901 --> 01:13:48,335
In the few minutes I will send for you

908
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:52,306
and you can see and carnage as well.

909
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:56,744
Keep an eye

910
01:13:56,779 --> 01:13:59,771
the dog that small.

911
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:24,296
Where is Kira?

912
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:26,604
How touching.

913
01:14:26,642 --> 01:14:28,610
Even in death,

914
01:14:28,644 --> 01:14:30,908
My warrior woman to miss her.

915
01:14:30,946 --> 01:14:32,743
How noble.

916
01:14:32,782 --> 01:14:34,977
You did not answer the question.

917
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:36,780
- Where is my wife?
- Your wife?

918
01:14:36,819 --> 01:14:39,083
Do not worry about it. Good.

919
01:14:39,121 --> 01:14:42,420
You know, have a special sympathy for me.

920
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:47,020
I will take care of it after your death.

921
01:14:47,062 --> 01:14:48,654
What did you say?

922
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:51,291
It is a special woman.

923
01:14:57,339 --> 01:15:01,241
Take it to room fighting.
What a shame.

924
01:15:08,784 --> 01:15:12,049
He said that I could taste a little
if I want.

925
01:15:13,989 --> 01:15:16,355
And not referred to the sandwich.

926
01:15:19,328 --> 01:15:24,197
Well, or you or Ivan ... what's the difference?

927
01:15:46,722 --> 01:15:48,656
The other party never arrived yet, sir.

928
01:15:48,691 --> 01:15:53,253
People can be so ungrateful.

929
01:15:53,295 --> 01:15:57,857
I do not think your brother
really loves you.

930
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:05,865
No, no, no.

931
01:16:05,908 --> 01:16:08,536
What a waste precious.

932
01:16:08,577 --> 01:16:10,909
You know what?

933
01:16:10,946 --> 01:16:13,073
May You give him two minutes.

934
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:19,779
If not here in two minutes,

935
01:16:19,822 --> 01:16:22,484
to detonate a machine that

936
01:16:22,524 --> 01:16:25,721
around her neck,

937
01:16:25,761 --> 01:16:27,388
to see if I pull the head.

938
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:29,226
Wait.

939
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:38,468
Ivan, fighting with me.

940
01:16:38,507 --> 01:16:40,600
Come on, coward.

941
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:44,943
We have 10 seconds ...

942
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,948
until the countdown.

943
01:16:46,982 --> 01:16:48,882
That should be somewhat interesting.

944
01:16:48,918 --> 01:16:51,887
10,

945
01:16:51,921 --> 01:16:54,048
9, 8 ...

946
01:16:54,089 --> 01:16:55,647
- Wait.
- Seven ...

947
01:16:55,691 --> 01:16:57,454
- Wait.
- Six,

948
01:16:57,493 --> 01:17:01,156
five,

949
01:17:01,196 --> 01:17:03,323
four,

950
01:17:03,365 --> 01:17:05,890
three,

951
01:17:05,935 --> 01:17:07,334
two ...

952
01:17:07,369 --> 01:17:11,135
I'm here.

953
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:14,301
Sophia, are you okay?

954
01:17:14,343 --> 01:17:15,935
Andre!

955
01:17:16,946 --> 01:17:19,744
You late!

956
01:17:21,283 --> 01:17:22,841
To start the fight.

957
01:17:26,055 --> 01:17:30,151
Broadcast live to start now.

958
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:36,424
Welcome to the broadcast tonight

959
01:17:36,465 --> 01:17:38,695
from around the world.

960
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:40,702
We present two of the largest

961
01:17:40,736 --> 01:17:42,226
MMA fighters,

962
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,239
that will tear the dead.

963
01:17:44,273 --> 01:17:45,831
After tonight,

964
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:48,206
one will be declared champion.

965
01:18:21,276 --> 01:18:23,972
Ladies and gentlemen,

966
01:18:24,013 --> 01:18:26,311
good evening.

967
01:18:32,554 --> 01:18:35,182
Welcome to the last

968
01:18:35,224 --> 01:18:38,387
great fight to the death,

969
01:18:38,427 --> 01:18:41,419
the two largest of our fighters,

970
01:18:41,463 --> 01:18:45,991
Rainerio "The Rain Man" Isandro

971
01:18:46,035 --> 01:18:48,003
against

972
01:18:48,037 --> 01:18:52,701
Andre "Hurricane" Fontaine!

973
01:18:52,741 --> 01:18:54,936
To start the fight!

974
01:21:06,041 --> 01:21:08,100
Cheat. Cheat.

975
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:11,909
Ensure perimeter.
Slaughtered them both.

976
01:21:23,225 --> 01:21:25,090
Where is it? Where's the detonator?

977
01:21:25,127 --> 01:21:27,254
Where's the fucking exploding?

978
01:21:33,235 --> 01:21:36,170
One to keep them away. Open fire.

979
01:21:36,205 --> 01:21:38,002
Are you crazy?

980
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,008
We must go back to save your sister.

981
01:21:40,042 --> 01:21:41,475
Okay.

982
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:30,618
Where's the fucking exploding?

983
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:37,055
Warning.

984
01:22:37,099 --> 01:22:39,590
Andre, no!

985
01:22:39,635 --> 01:22:41,728
Andre, no!

986
01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:44,102
Run, baby!

987
01:22:44,139 --> 01:22:45,629
Run, are good.

988
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:46,971
No!

989
01:23:27,282 --> 01:23:29,307
Jackey.

990
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,983
Jackey.

991
01:23:33,021 -> 01:23:35,819
Hello.

992
01:23:35,857 --> 01:23:38,052
Remember me, is not it?

993
01:23:38,093 --> 01:23:40,891
Okay, I take you out of here.

994
01:23:40,929 --> 01:23:42,863
We must be silent.

995
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:46,356
Well, come on.
Come with me, come on.

996
01:23:55,110 --> 01:23:58,341
Do not compare anything with a maniac

997
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:01,349
with a fucking big sword

998
01:24:01,383 --> 01:24:05,877
to ruin your day.

999
01:24:05,921 --> 01:24:07,889
You were

1000
01:24:07,923 --> 01:24:11,086
a great disappointment to me.

1001
01:24:12,761 --> 01:24:14,661
I will slaughter you

1002
01:24:14,696 --> 01:24:16,721
as a lambkin.

1003
01:26:19,254 --> 01:26:21,313
Baby.

1004
01:26:21,356 --> 01:26:23,483
Kira.

1005
01:26:23,525 --> 01:26:25,857
Try not to talk.

1006
01:26:25,894 --> 01:26:27,259
How do I ...

1007
01:26:27,295 --> 01:26:28,990
Wolf's son was also held here.

1008
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:31,498
I managed to escape and call the police.

1009
01:26:31,533 --> 01:26:33,831
I found his body lying next to Ivan.

1010
01:26:33,869 --> 01:26:37,327
Oh, you're beautiful.

1011
01:26:37,372 --> 01:26:38,862
You okay?

1012
01:26:38,907 --> 01:26:41,398
We have both.

1013
01:26:41,443 --> 01:26:43,104
I promise.

1014
01:26:53,421 --> 01:26:55,753
I love You.

1015
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:57,382
love you too.

1016
01:27:26,121 --> 01:27:31,084
<i> Have fun with Rajpal any time </i>
