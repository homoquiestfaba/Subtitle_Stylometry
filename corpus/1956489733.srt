<i>You've reached the Hugo Pool Company.</i>

2
00:01:09,334 --> 00:01:10,854
<i>This is you-know-who.</i>

3
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:13,254
<i>Leave your message
right after the you-know-what.</i>

4
00:01:15,254 --> 00:01:18,654
<i>Hugo Dugay. It's you-know-who.</i>

5
00:01:18,654 --> 00:01:22,734
<i>You know, I just went out to take a swim,
and my pool was empty.</i>

6
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:24,854
<i>Fill me back up by 6:30 tonight.</i>

7
00:01:24,854 --> 00:01:28,334
<i>Chic, she can't do that
because of the drought.</i>

8
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:32,214
<i>If she puts water in an empty pool
and gets caught, there's a $10,000 fine.</i>

9
00:01:32,214 --> 00:01:33,894
<i>You stay out of this.</i>

10
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,894
<i>And if you water your lawn, it's $8,000,</i>

11
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:38,694
<i>and if you get caught washing your car,
it's $5,000!</i>

12
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:43,194
<i>Don't listen to this lunatic, Hugo.
She's a drinker.</i>

13
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:45,134
<i>Just do what I tell you.</i>

14
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:48,014
<i>If there's a fine, I'll split it with you.</i>

15
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:51,014
<i>Don't trust Chic Chicalini. He's a bozo!</i>

16
00:01:51,014 --> 00:01:55,214
<i>Hey, you leave me alone
or I'll find somebody who will!</i>

17
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:57,054
<i>- Go ahead!
- Shut up!</i>

18
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:58,534
<i>You shut up!</i>

19
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:56,734
<i>You've reached the Hugo Pool Company.</i>

20
00:02:56,734 --> 00:02:58,214

22
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:03,734
<i>Miss Dugay,</i>

23
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:05,614
<i>I can tell by the sound of your voice</i>

24
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:07,174
<i>that we can do business.</i>

25
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:08,734
<i>Good people tell me that you're</i>

26
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:11,134
<i>the prettiest pool person in the Canyon.</i>

27
00:03:11,134 --> 00:03:13,134
<i>My name is Floyd Cayleo.</i>

28
00:03:13,134 --> 00:03:15,934
<i>1739 Catatonic Pass Road.</i>

29
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:20,434
<i>I need your special expertise.
Looking forward. Gracias.</i>

33
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:38,174
<i>Hugo...</i>

34
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:41,454
<i>It's your mother. I can't sleep.</i>

35
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:45,004
<i>Please come see me today.
I'll never ask again.</i>

36
00:05:27,814 --> 00:05:29,964
Good morning!

37
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:34,774
Good morning.

38
00:05:34,774 --> 00:05:36,934
- Hi.
- Hi.

39
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,368
I need chemicals, please.

40
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:41,288
OK.

41
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:47,014
How many pools today?

42
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,854
44. Maybe 45.
I might have a new customer.

43
00:05:49,854 --> 00:05:52,368
- Wow. Good luck.
- Thank you.

44
00:05:54,174 --> 00:05:55,972
OK. Oh...

45
00:05:57,974 --> 00:06:00,174
While I load up...

46
00:06:00,174 --> 00:06:01,854
...get your father.

47
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:04,174
He's in the back.
He's been here all night.

48
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:07,574
Is he stoned? Is he loaded?
Is he blasted out of his mind?

49
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:10,612
I have nothing to compare to.

50
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:21,814
Hi, Dad.

51
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,568
Yo, sister.

52
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:29,094
There's something you gotta know.

53
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:33,594
I'm off the snow, no more blow
and the vodka had to go.

54
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:37,894
There's only one thing left that I still do.

55
00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:40,734
And that's the ring-dang-doo.

56
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:47,494
Don't panic.

57
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:50,964
I'm here to be of service and much love.

58
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:57,314
But first... I need $5,000 to join AA.

59
00:06:57,574 --> 00:07:00,654
- Since when do they charge?
- They don't, sister.

60
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:04,773
Frankly speaking, I need the bread,
so I can get into a serious rehab.

61
00:07:06,574 --> 00:07:08,326
I'm a little shaky today.

62
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:11,968
Will you help me?

63
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:15,450
I need you to help me today, Dad.

64
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:18,694
You got me, sister.

65
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:22,414
I'm not your sister.
You're my father. I'm your daughter.

66
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:24,694
No sister in sight.

67
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,734
You and your brother
are marijuana accidents.

68
00:07:27,734 --> 00:07:30,089
Brother?! What brother?

69
00:07:31,614 --> 00:07:33,252
I thought I had a son.

70
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:36,254
No.

71
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:38,370
Why are you looking so depressed?

72
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:41,731
Got a long day ahead of me, Dad.

73
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:46,014
Where's the quickest place
to get a water truck?

74
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:48,774
Well, I only know of one.

75
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:50,845
It's a beaut, though. Top of the line.

76
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:55,132
- Brendan Cavanagh.
- Great. Thank you!

77
00:07:57,614 --> 00:08:00,447
See you tomorrow.
Come on, Dad. Move it or lose it.

78
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,088
See you tomorrow.

79
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:26,654
Are you the Dugays?

80
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:29,214
That's us, mister. Hugo and Henry.

81
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:30,894
How are you doing?

82
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:34,294
My dad's going to pick up a load
of water, so he needs a set of wheels.

83
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:36,294
Can you handle my baby?

84
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:38,294
Or are you too old?

85
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:41,694
Not as old as I look.

86
00:08:41,694 --> 00:08:44,894
Six gears is nothing to me, man.

87
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:49,294
I can't be too possessive.
Gotta let her out every once in a while.

88
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:51,763
Jealousy is the worst emotion there is.

89
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,334
Where is she?

90
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:58,132
She's in her crib.

91
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:02,174
And have her back by midnight!

92
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,654
Well, where am I going?

93
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:06,174
The Colorado River
is where you're going, fast.

94
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:08,534
It's 89 miles
to where it comes into California.

95
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:10,494
When you get there,
you suck 3,000 gallons

96
00:09:10,494 --> 00:09:12,254
out of the river and into the truck.

97
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:15,414
Then you zip on back
to 2533 Lemaline Lane.

98
00:09:15,414 --> 00:09:19,851
And that's where we fill up
the pool of Chicalini by 6:30 tonight.

99
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:24,574
If I can't pull this off,
I don't deserve rehab.

100
00:09:24,574 --> 00:09:28,094
Hey, I'd advise you to stay away from me
if you don't get this job done.

101
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:29,574
Give me a chance, bro.

102
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:31,214
Chances are taken, not given.

103
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:32,894
I'm on the case.

104
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:34,328
You'd better be, Dad.

105
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:51,414
Hey.

106
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:52,848
Hmm?

107
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:57,654
I like your vehicle.

108
00:09:57,654 --> 00:10:00,612
Well, it's not mine. But it is mine today.

109
00:10:14,694 --> 00:10:19,194
I'm going to go to the Colorado River,
pick up a load and then come right back.

110
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:20,774
What's the cargo?

111
00:10:20,774 --> 00:10:23,254
Can't tell until we get there.

112
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:25,294
That's fine by me.
I've never been to Colorado River.

113
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:26,974
But I have an aunt in Denver.

114
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:28,885
Your shoes are exquisite.

115
00:10:32,774 --> 00:10:35,288
You're a gentleman.
They're few and far between.

116
00:12:10,694 --> 00:12:12,774
You got a name, bro?

117
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,254
No questions, please.

118
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:18,254
Henry Dugay. Give me four.
Five is too jive.

119
00:12:18,254 --> 00:12:20,534
Yeah!

120
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:23,894
My hand's on fire with camaraderie.
My skin burns with bonding.

121
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:25,328
Thank you.

122
00:12:27,134 --> 00:12:30,650
Your shoes are longing and lusting
to be mine.

123
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,894
- How much did you pay for them?
- I'll never tell.

124
00:12:35,894 --> 00:12:39,094
There are only five pairs of these shoes
in the world, and they're all registered.

125
00:12:39,094 --> 00:12:40,164
Ah.

126
00:13:32,654 --> 00:13:34,334
- Mr Mazur?
- Uh-huh.

127
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:36,654
It's Hugo.

128
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:38,734
- What can I do?
- Nothing.

129
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,532
The deed is done, and so am I.

130
00:13:41,734 --> 00:13:44,454
Yesterday, as the sun was setting -
a magic hour -

131
00:13:44,454 --> 00:13:48,054
I began directing the first shot
of my new movie,

132
00:13:48,054 --> 00:13:50,494
entitled Rebel Without a Suitcase.

133
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:52,334
Congratulations.

134
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:55,292
What for? For what? Why?

135
00:13:56,774 --> 00:14:00,214
Because simply, as I start the first scene
with my leading lady,

136
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,614
I say, with enthusiasm, "Action!"

137
00:14:03,614 --> 00:14:06,454
I notice immediately problem.

138
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:10,254
Background extra...
jumping around like kangaroo.

139
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:11,974
Plus, laughing.

140
00:14:11,974 --> 00:14:13,454
"Cut.

141
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:17,614
"Excuse me, Mr Extra.
Hello. Franz Mazur, director.

142
00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:20,014
"Please, next time, consolidate,
bring it down, be still."

143
00:14:20,014 --> 00:14:22,694
But he says,
"I will not be still for nobody.

144
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:25,494
"But especially not for a hack like you."

145
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:27,374
I remove my pistol from my pocket.

146
00:14:27,374 --> 00:14:30,454
I fire three shots
into this pretentious ham!

147
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,894
When he hits the deck,
he is as dead as a dead man can be.

148
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,924
So... Rebel Without a Suitcase
has been shut down.

149
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:43,774
Which is infuriating me, because
it would have been my best effort.

150
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:47,768
I wrote it all by myself
with the charlatan who wrote the novel.

151
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:52,854
Can you give me a lift?

152
00:14:52,854 --> 00:14:54,334
Where to?

153
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:57,934
Uh... half a mile or so.

154
00:14:57,934 --> 00:15:01,534
I'll just go in my house
and do something big-time,

155
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,334
then I'll double-split with you.

156
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:05,014
Hey, how come you're not in jail?

157
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:09,414
I was. For, like, a little while.
Now I'm out on bail.

158
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:11,371
Thank God it's Los Angeles.

159
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:14,974
I'll get over this.

160
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:17,094
Well, you've got to do something
for the environment.

161
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:21,594
Maybe I'll work with
a little community service! Ah, yes.

162
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,734
I'm coming!

163
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:25,454
Franz? Yes?

164
00:15:25,454 --> 00:15:27,374
Can I come in? Of course.

165
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:29,574
I'm coming inside now.

166
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:32,094
Why? I don't know.

167
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:34,974
What's that?
Well, you'll see in a minute.

168
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:36,654
What are you going to do?

169
00:15:36,654 --> 00:15:38,894
Oh, come on, don't be a spoilsport.

170
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:41,204
Just wait. I'll tell you in a minute.

171
00:15:44,774 --> 00:15:46,454
Thank God it's done.

172
00:15:46,454 --> 00:15:48,454
What's done?

173
00:15:48,454 --> 00:15:51,214
My house. I set it on fire.

174
00:15:51,214 --> 00:15:54,054
- Why?
- Insurance.

175
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:57,054
I need the money.
You don't mind, do you?

176
00:15:57,054 --> 00:15:58,692
It's none of my business.

177
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:06,894
The smoke is arousing me.

178
00:16:15,894 --> 00:16:19,853
Right over here by this bush.
That's my bush.

179
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:24,614
You know, the question is,
if I am found not guilty

180
00:16:24,614 --> 00:16:29,114
of murdering this insignificant extra
scum... bucket...

181
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:34,254
... will I then be known about town
as an ex-murderer?

182
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,404
- Not to me, pal.
- Oh, not to you.

183
00:16:38,134 --> 00:16:40,523
How's by you? Fine by me.

184
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:46,645
Well, I'm off like a dirty shirt.

185
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:28,772
I knew you'd come through.

186
00:17:32,254 --> 00:17:34,014
So, what's up?

187
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:35,494
I need you to help me.

188
00:17:35,494 --> 00:17:38,894
And that means you've got to stay
with me all day and do something.

189
00:17:38,894 --> 00:17:41,494
OK. Do you want to know
what's going on in my life?

190
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:42,974
No.

191
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:46,054
And listen up, Ma,
when I get out of the truck, you get out.

192
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:48,054
We do each pool as quick as we can.

193
00:17:48,054 --> 00:17:51,814
You scoop the leaves out.
I put the chemicals in.

194
00:17:51,814 --> 00:17:55,294
There's 39 more pools
and already I'm running late.

195
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:57,214
I'm in a lot of pain.

196
00:17:57,214 --> 00:18:00,614
The usual?
You're so perceptive.

197
00:18:00,614 --> 00:18:03,974
The race was supposed to be fixed,
but of course nobody told my horse.

198
00:18:03,974 --> 00:18:07,294
Finished last. $4,800.

199
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,974
I'm in so much trouble with my bookie,

200
00:18:08,974 --> 00:18:11,574
who says, by the way,
that if I don't pay him off today,

201
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:13,254
I have to have sex with him.

202
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:15,334
Be thankful he thinks
you're worth that much.

203
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:17,610
That hurt me
more than you'll ever know.

204
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:20,174
I'll forgive you.

205
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:23,214
- Let's forget, OK?
- Forgotten.

206
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:26,134
I smell your father's cheap cologne.

207
00:18:26,134 --> 00:18:27,854
What is that? Essence of Goon?

208
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:29,334
Was he in here today?

209
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:31,291
Dad is working with me today.

210
00:19:40,374 --> 00:19:42,934
Ugh. My feet are killing me.
I'm not doing this.

211
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:48,814
How much do you owe your bookie?

212
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:51,454
$4,800.
Ma!

213
00:19:52,614 --> 00:19:54,214
$750.

214
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:56,294
I knew it wasn't $4,800.

215
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:58,494
Great. Now I'm not going to have
anything to bet with.

216
00:19:58,494 --> 00:20:01,894
Forget bets.
You're getting paid to help me.

217
00:20:01,894 --> 00:20:04,014
Really?
Yeah.

218
00:20:04,014 --> 00:20:07,014
Just finish on your feet
and I'll give you the $750.

219
00:20:07,014 --> 00:20:09,574
And then you'll be done with this man.

220
00:20:09,574 --> 00:20:12,134
And then what do I do?
You quit.

221
00:20:13,694 --> 00:20:15,731
Quit what?
Gambling.

222
00:20:16,774 --> 00:20:18,454
Are you out of your mind?!

223
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:21,054
Playing horses is not gambling.

224
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,134
It's the sport of kings.

225
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:25,694
OK, at least grab the chemicals.
Do something!

226
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:48,534
Give me a minute and 30 seconds,

227
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:51,334
then you come in and do the pool,
and don't even talk to me.

228
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,768
It'll be impressive, Ma.

229
00:21:20,294 --> 00:21:22,808
Hi. Mr Gaylen?

230
00:21:27,414 --> 00:21:28,848
Hugo Dugay.

231
00:21:40,774 --> 00:21:43,374
What I have is not contagious.

232
00:21:43,374 --> 00:21:45,374
What is it?

233
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:51,354
ALS - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

234
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:56,894
And he was a great baseball player,
and I wasn't so bad myself.

235
00:21:58,374 --> 00:21:59,808
Where's your pool?

236
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,611
I don't have a pool.

237
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:08,091
Then, pray tell, why am I here?

238
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:14,134
To build me a very special pool,

239
00:22:14,134 --> 00:22:17,134
so that I can be lowered into the water
on a pulley system

240
00:22:17,134 --> 00:22:19,694
and do my range-of-motion exercises.

241
00:22:19,694 --> 00:22:22,334
Well, how about I come back tomorrow
and we make a plan?

242
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:25,612
I'd like that.

243
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:30,934
Andy, say hello to Hugo Dugay.

244
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,572
- Howdy, Hugo.
- Hi.

245
00:22:33,774 --> 00:22:35,734
Andy is my caregiver.

246
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:40,234
Andy feeds me and lifts me
and scratches the top of my head,

247
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:42,373
and anything else I need.

248
00:22:43,414 --> 00:22:46,054
- Which way to the pool?
- No pool, Ma.

249
00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:48,854
Mr Gaylen, this is my mother, Minerva.

250
00:22:48,854 --> 00:22:52,813
Please call me Floyd.
Hello. Excuse me.

251
00:23:08,294 --> 00:23:09,728
Shit.

252
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,691
How long have you been
in that wheelchair?

253
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:21,974
123 days.

254
00:23:21,974 --> 00:23:25,094
Up until then,
I was getting along with a Quirky Gait.

255
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:26,614
- What's that?
- It's a horse!

256
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,854
Quirky Gait is a horse
that's in today's races.

257
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:30,492
OK, just let me see.
Oh, Mom...

258
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:35,134
Oh, man.

259
00:23:35,134 --> 00:23:36,568
OK, let's see.

260
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:41,254
OK, he's never won, but he's recently
been gelded, so he's focused.

261
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:45,754
Quirky Gait, second race.
He's 30 to 1 and he's got a shot.

262
00:23:46,454 --> 00:23:49,614
This is it! This is the one.
Get me down! Get me down!

263
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:52,494
Forget it, Ma.
You're not going to the track today.

264
00:23:52,494 --> 00:23:54,894
It's not today, OK? It's tonight.

265
00:23:54,894 --> 00:23:56,894
Quirky Gait is running
in the second race.

266
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,374
Harness racing.

267
00:23:58,374 --> 00:24:01,774
They're not as fast as thoroughbreds,
but what the hell? A horse is a horse.

268
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:04,414
Oh, get me down!
Get me down on Quirky Gait!

269
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:08,294
Oh, yeah.
I'm about to come off the slide.

270
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:10,974
I mean, this is so powerful

271
00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:14,494
that I can feel it in every fibre.

272
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,725
Oh! Oooh, it's... it's a tingler.

273
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:22,327
- You're drifting, Ma.
- Oh.

274
00:24:24,134 --> 00:24:28,254
No, she's not.
Quirky Gait will definitely win.

275
00:24:28,254 --> 00:24:30,614
Oh. Thank you.

276
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:34,414
But the horse can't win
unless you come with me

277
00:24:34,414 --> 00:24:37,574
while I make my bet at the track - live.

278
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:39,054
- Ma!
- Stay out of this.

279
00:24:39,054 --> 00:24:40,734
Floyd, I'm officially inviting you

280
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:43,134
to spend the rest of the day
with me and my daughter.

281
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:46,254
And then tonight, after we collect
all our winnings, you're free to go.

282
00:24:46,254 --> 00:24:48,614
- That's very good of you.
- Oh. Let's go, kid.

283
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:50,614
- No way.
- Look, he's coming or I'm not going.

284
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,294
- Why?!
- Because it's a sure thing.

285
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:54,294
And you just don't blow a sure thing.
He's coming.

286
00:24:54,294 --> 00:24:56,134
- I cannot believe this!
- Oh, you'll get over it.

287
00:24:56,134 --> 00:24:58,374
Andy, take the day off

288
00:24:58,374 --> 00:25:00,092
OK, boss. I'll get your stuff.

289
00:25:02,094 --> 00:25:03,528
OK.

290
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:07,574
- This is not a good idea.
- You're wrong.

291
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:11,494
I'm running late enough as it is, and
if I'm not done by 6:30, I could be dead.

292
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:12,494
Why?

293
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:14,814
I have an Italian customer who
is a dangerous punk.

294
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:17,974
Who?

295
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,454
Chic Chicalini.

296
00:25:19,454 --> 00:25:20,934
The Chic Chicalini?

297
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:22,934
Yeah, he's one of my customers.
You got the picture?

298
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:26,534
Oh, my God. Alright, listen.
Just let Floyd come with us, OK?

299
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:28,534
And I swear to God,
I'll work twice as hard.

300
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:30,445
- You'd better!
- I will.

301
00:25:31,974 --> 00:25:33,931
Where's that caregiver guy?

302
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,252
How are we going to do this?

303
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:49,334
Y'all have a good one.

304
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:52,294
And, boss, don't go into overdrool.

305
00:25:52,294 --> 00:25:55,254
The little ladies might not think
too kindly of that one.

306
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,688
Fuck you.

307
00:26:11,854 --> 00:26:13,811
I've got a lot of shame.

308
00:26:14,854 --> 00:26:17,254
What are you ashamed of?

309
00:26:17,254 --> 00:26:18,734
Ring-dang-doo.

310
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:20,452
Ring-dang-doo? What is that?

311
00:26:21,494 --> 00:26:23,326
The best of everything.

312
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:29,474
Oh. If it's the best of everything,
why are you ashamed?

313
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:31,494
'Cause it's killing me. I'm dying.

314
00:26:31,494 --> 00:26:33,534
I'm a lying piece of shit.

315
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:36,134
Oh, who says?

316
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:38,334
Says the reigning queen
of the ring-dang-doo.

317
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:41,292
Her Majesty, the bitch of tinfoil.

318
00:26:44,294 --> 00:26:47,412
If words could speak,
I still would have nothing to say.

319
00:26:56,454 --> 00:26:59,054
- Pardon me, kid.
- Oh. You're pardoned.

320
00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:00,814
Have you seen my son?

321
00:27:00,814 --> 00:27:02,814
- Mr Neely?
- Yeah, that's him.

322
00:27:02,814 --> 00:27:05,214
- Have you seen him?
- No, not... not lately.

323
00:27:05,214 --> 00:27:07,894
He brought me out from New York,
you know, for hip surgery.

324
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:09,734
You know, double hip replacement.

325
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:12,134
He dropped me off
and I haven't seen him in a week.

326
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:14,534
He was supposed to set it up.

327
00:27:14,534 --> 00:27:16,894
Well, can I call you a taxi or something?

328
00:27:16,894 --> 00:27:18,894
Well, where would I go?

329
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:20,851
Go back to New York.
Get your hips done there.

330
00:27:22,614 --> 00:27:25,334
Thank you. Thank you very much.

331
00:27:25,334 --> 00:27:26,972
You're welcome.

332
00:27:28,374 --> 00:27:31,974
You know,
I have a terrific retirement annuity.

333
00:27:31,974 --> 00:27:34,974
- Oh. I'm happy for you.
- Yeah.

334
00:27:34,974 --> 00:27:38,968
Er... I'll give you the money
if I could just look down your pants.

335
00:27:40,014 --> 00:27:42,774
You know, just...
just loosen them up, huh,

336
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:44,454
so I could take a peep?

337
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,092
I think not.

338
00:27:47,134 --> 00:27:49,414
Exactly how much money
are we talking about?

339
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:50,848
Ma!

340
00:27:52,614 --> 00:27:55,814
Tell you what -
I'll get your number from my daughter,

341
00:27:55,814 --> 00:27:57,646
and, uh, well, I'll call you later.

342
00:27:59,334 --> 00:28:01,166
I'll give you a reason to live.

343
00:28:04,174 --> 00:28:05,608
Oooh.

344
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,294
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

345
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:52,574
What are you doing?
You going skateboarding today?

346
00:28:52,574 --> 00:28:54,574
Did you eat your breakfast?

347
00:28:54,574 --> 00:28:56,734
Did you kiss your mother?

348
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:59,374
Did you tell your stepfather
he's a piece of shit?

349
00:29:09,774 --> 00:29:12,374
I'm not going to yell at you
like your mother yells at you.

350
00:29:12,374 --> 00:29:15,334
Women are like that. You know
what I mean? They're fucking bitches.

351
00:29:15,334 --> 00:29:17,374
Think women are bitches?

352
00:29:17,374 --> 00:29:19,524
You don't? Wait.

353
00:29:29,854 --> 00:29:31,854
W...watch this. Watch this.

354
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,894
Hey, you girls look lovely over there.

355
00:29:33,894 --> 00:29:37,094
Thank you very much
for cleaning our pool, huh?

356
00:29:37,094 --> 00:29:39,290
I'd love to take
the blonde one and, you know...

357
00:29:42,974 --> 00:29:46,374
Hey, you know, I should tell you
about the birds and the bees.

358
00:29:46,374 --> 00:29:48,134
She's a bird and I'm a bee.

359
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:50,694
See, look at her over there,
bent over like that.

360
00:29:50,694 --> 00:29:53,894
What happens is, I sting the bird.

361
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:58,123
I go over there
and I sting the shit out of her.

362
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:00,654
Hi. How are you?

363
00:30:00,654 --> 00:30:02,134
- How you doing?
- Yeah.

364
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:05,934
You know what the word 'bang' means?
You know, you can do...

365
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:09,134
You can be very friendly
with two people at a time, you know?

366
00:30:09,134 --> 00:30:12,013
And there's the two I'd like right now.
Look at her.

367
00:30:17,054 --> 00:30:18,534
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

368
00:30:18,534 --> 00:30:22,374
Now...tell that blonde...
tell her that she's got a nice ass.

369
00:30:22,374 --> 00:30:24,894
- Go on, go and tell her...
- Shut up, Dad.

370
00:30:24,894 --> 00:30:26,532
I'm going for a dip.

371
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:36,014
Hi. Do you need anything?

372
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:39,774
Please scratch.

373
00:30:39,774 --> 00:30:41,814
Where?

374
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:44,014
- Top of my head.
- OK.

375
00:30:44,014 --> 00:30:46,414
Ohhhh... yes, yes.

376
00:30:46,414 --> 00:30:49,054
Ohhhh... ooooh.

377
00:30:49,054 --> 00:30:51,374
OK.

378
00:30:51,374 --> 00:30:52,808
Thank you.

379
00:30:54,774 --> 00:30:56,208
Don't mention it.

380
00:31:11,854 --> 00:31:14,254
If those shoes were mine,
I'd stretch them.

381
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:16,654
No! No.

382
00:31:16,654 --> 00:31:18,854
I'd mount them as an abstract sculpture.

383
00:31:18,854 --> 00:31:21,054
Well, if something happens to me,
I'll leave them to you,

384
00:31:21,054 --> 00:31:23,534
but only if you promise
to drop the subject.

385
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:24,968
Alright, I promise.

386
00:31:48,414 --> 00:31:51,372
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Chad. New lifeguard.

387
00:31:52,414 --> 00:31:55,614
- I'm Hugo. That's my mom, Minerva.
- Hey.

388
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,294
- Hello.
- How are you?

389
00:31:57,294 --> 00:32:00,814
I'm from Canada. There's not much
lifeguard work up there, eh?

390
00:32:00,814 --> 00:32:03,454
Four months a year at the best.

391
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,843
- Yeah, well, we miss you already.
- 'Bye.

392
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,334
Ooh!

393
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:39,814
Oh!

394
00:32:39,814 --> 00:32:41,248
Oh!

395
00:32:44,294 --> 00:32:46,294
Chad!

396
00:32:46,294 --> 00:32:49,174
- Hey!
- Chad! I can't swim.

397
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:50,694
Oh! Chad!

398
00:32:50,694 --> 00:32:52,332
Chad!

399
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:20,654
I dig the way you walk.

400
00:33:20,654 --> 00:33:22,134
Did you miss me?

401
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:23,568
Yes.

402
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:47,447
Mr Chicalini,
what are you doing way over here?

403
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:51,974
Why aren't you fetching my water?

404
00:33:51,974 --> 00:33:55,014
Your water is being gotten right now.

405
00:33:55,014 --> 00:33:57,814
You sent somebody else?

406
00:33:57,814 --> 00:33:59,814
Yes, I did.

407
00:33:59,814 --> 00:34:02,014
Ho! Who did you send?

408
00:34:02,014 --> 00:34:03,814
My father.

409
00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:06,534
You know, I'm getting an image of you

410
00:34:06,534 --> 00:34:09,734
inside of a baby coffin,

411
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:12,054
but you don't quite fit.

412
00:34:12,054 --> 00:34:13,734
Um...

413
00:34:13,734 --> 00:34:16,814
I'm trying to stuff you back in,
but it's not easy.

414
00:34:16,814 --> 00:34:21,365
So I just, uh... give up.

415
00:34:23,614 --> 00:34:26,254
And they bury you half in and half out.

416
00:34:29,294 --> 00:34:32,605
Whatever it takes... it takes.

417
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:37,934
Just so it doesn't take past 6:30...

418
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:40,403
... or you're going into the next dimension.

419
00:34:41,654 --> 00:34:43,088
Catch you later.

420
00:34:45,614 --> 00:34:47,048
Hmm.

421
00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:49,608
Hmm.

422
00:34:52,974 --> 00:34:55,494
So, my daughter said
you've got this thing wrong with you,

423
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:57,334
something called ALS.

424
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:58,814
So, what's it do to you?

425
00:35:02,454 --> 00:35:05,014
It attacks the nerves until they die.

426
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:11,174
The only parts of the body
that don't get destroyed

427
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:13,614
are the brain and the ability to eliminate.

428
00:35:13,614 --> 00:35:17,130
The ability to make love is also altered
just a little bit.

429
00:36:23,574 --> 00:36:27,169
Ring-dang-doo, ring-dang-doo,
let me touch just one shoe.

430
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:33,734
They're spiritual, bro.
They're giving me hope.

431
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,414
You like them that much, huh?

432
00:36:35,414 --> 00:36:39,014
Sure do.
Even more than the ring-dang-doo.

433
00:36:39,014 --> 00:36:41,014
Do you ever talk about anything else?

434
00:36:41,014 --> 00:36:43,334
No. I got two subjects.

435
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,534
Ring-dang-doo...

436
00:36:45,534 --> 00:36:47,014
... and those shoes.

437
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:48,494
Well, you're simply not getting them.

438
00:36:48,494 --> 00:36:50,451
You have no intention
of keeping your word.

439
00:36:53,974 --> 00:36:56,374
Just give me those shoes...

440
00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:59,412
... which are my shoes,
and stop fucking with me.

441
00:37:01,294 --> 00:37:02,974
Would it be considered as bad form

442
00:37:02,974 --> 00:37:05,124
if I were to throw you
into the Colorado River?

443
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:15,854
Yeah, me too.

444
00:37:15,854 --> 00:37:18,254
- Want a cookie?
- No.

445
00:37:18,254 --> 00:37:21,414
I want to make a substantial bet
on Quirky Gait.

446
00:37:21,414 --> 00:37:24,334
- Will you show me how?
- Of course I will.

447
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:26,734
We should roll, Ma.
OK.

448
00:37:26,734 --> 00:37:28,854
Exactly how substantial?

449
00:37:28,854 --> 00:37:31,254
10 grand.

450
00:37:31,254 --> 00:37:33,086
Now I know we're going to win.

451
00:37:34,974 --> 00:37:39,684
Hugo, I just got a twitch in my right arm.
Can you see it?

452
00:37:42,334 --> 00:37:43,768
Oooh!

453
00:37:46,334 --> 00:37:47,972
No, I can't see it.

454
00:37:50,374 --> 00:37:52,445
Please touch my right elbow.

455
00:37:58,494 --> 00:37:59,928
Yeah, I feel that.

456
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:06,092
That's what happens
just before I lose something.

457
00:38:09,494 --> 00:38:11,132
You're going to beat this.

458
00:38:13,854 --> 00:38:16,414
I like the way you think.

459
00:38:20,574 --> 00:38:22,854
Could I have some of your water, please?

460
00:38:22,854 --> 00:38:24,288
Mm-hm.

461
00:38:42,134 --> 00:38:43,772
Can I get you something to eat?

462
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:47,814
No, thank you. I'm having too much fun.

463
00:38:52,614 --> 00:38:57,094
You know, when I was little,
I was diagnosed with diabetes.

464
00:38:57,094 --> 00:39:00,849
But... sometimes, like now...

465
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:05,134
... I dream about chocolate-chip cookies.

466
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,772
Do you dream about walking?

467
00:39:10,134 --> 00:39:11,852
Every night.

468
00:39:24,174 --> 00:39:27,644
Wow.
I've never seen a leaf this close before.

469
00:39:28,694 --> 00:39:30,128
What do you see?

470
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:34,488
Well...

471
00:39:36,454 --> 00:39:38,374
I see me...

472
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:39,854
... calling my bookie.

473
00:39:39,854 --> 00:39:43,893
Then going to meet him,
paying him his $750.

474
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:47,134
Then... getting back in the truck,

475
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,534
and for the rest of the day,
working twice as hard.

476
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:52,534
I mean, harder than I've ever worked
in my whole adult life.

477
00:39:52,534 --> 00:39:54,534
I mean, those leaves
are just going to fly!

478
00:39:54,534 --> 00:39:58,414
It's going to be the best day ever.
I mean, it already is. Oh, my God!

479
00:39:58,414 --> 00:40:02,574
I just got used to the tattoos
on your ankles, but that...

480
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,008
... well, that's new.

481
00:40:05,374 --> 00:40:07,251
You might as well know about this one.

482
00:40:09,134 --> 00:40:11,134
Why?!

483
00:40:11,134 --> 00:40:14,334
Because I'm afraid to have sex
and I don't do drugs.

484
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:16,574
What else is there?

485
00:40:16,574 --> 00:40:20,374
Actually, there's body piercing,
so I got my navel pierced too.

486
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:23,574
Don't you have enough problems
with the holes you have?

487
00:40:23,574 --> 00:40:25,054
I know I do!

488
00:40:25,054 --> 00:40:26,488
Let's go, Mama.

489
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:44,094
I bet you think
my mother's a little weird, huh?

490
00:40:44,094 --> 00:40:46,694
No. I like her.

491
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,924
She got me out of the house.

492
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,131
Shhh.

493
00:41:11,374 --> 00:41:13,414
Go ahead, call your bookie, Ma.

494
00:41:13,414 --> 00:41:14,848
Thank you.

495
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:22,654
Irwin, hi. Minerva.

496
00:41:24,134 --> 00:41:25,814
Listen, I have the money.

497
00:41:25,814 --> 00:41:28,214
What do you say we hook up
right above the mailboxes,

498
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:30,490
down on the fork of the road
by Lemaline Lane?

499
00:41:31,854 --> 00:41:34,892
OK. See you soon. 'Bye.

500
00:41:36,214 --> 00:41:37,694
Thank you.

501
00:41:37,694 --> 00:41:40,208
- You're a good daughter.
- I know.

502
00:42:01,974 --> 00:42:03,612
Morning.

503
00:42:06,574 --> 00:42:08,054
Ha ha!

504
00:42:08,054 --> 00:42:10,254
- Good morning.
- Good morning' is passé.

505
00:42:10,254 --> 00:42:12,974
It's past noon, Huggo Dugay.

506
00:42:12,974 --> 00:42:15,694
Franz, this is my mother, Minerva -
gambler.

507
00:42:15,694 --> 00:42:17,174
Cutie-pie.

508
00:42:17,174 --> 00:42:19,094
- Mom, this is Franz.
- Hello.

509
00:42:19,094 --> 00:42:20,774
- Murder in the first.
- Ha!

510
00:42:20,774 --> 00:42:22,454
And that's Floyd Gaylen, but...

511
00:42:22,454 --> 00:42:24,454
No guests!

512
00:42:24,454 --> 00:42:27,854
Don't worry, Mother.
Won't touch your daughter's pouch.

513
00:42:27,854 --> 00:42:30,614
It's you I will consume shortly.

514
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,614
How is H-Huggo today, Huggo?

515
00:42:33,614 --> 00:42:36,054
I'd be a lot better
if you paid your pool bill.

516
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,494
With what funds, me darling Dugay?

517
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:41,774
The insurance money you're going to get
from the house you burned down.

518
00:42:41,774 --> 00:42:45,454
Uh...how long has it been
since I paid you? Four years?

519
00:42:45,454 --> 00:42:47,134
Five.
Five years.

520
00:42:47,134 --> 00:42:49,614
- How embarrassing for you.
- Stop the doubletalk.

521
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:54,114
I have carried you for 61 months
and you've been jiving me since day one.

522
00:42:54,254 --> 00:42:56,723
Pay me! Everything else is bullshit!

523
00:43:03,134 --> 00:43:05,454
Don't shut me out
because of the moneys, Huggo.

524
00:43:05,454 --> 00:43:08,854
I don't shut anybody out, especially
someone who owes me $12,400.

525
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:11,654
Oh, again we return
to the subject of moneys.

526
00:43:11,654 --> 00:43:14,168
How pedestrian you can be.

527
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:18,334
Ah... hello.

528
00:43:18,334 --> 00:43:21,254
Oh, I like it that you're including
your mother in your work.

529
00:43:21,254 --> 00:43:23,134
- Is she a gift for me?
- No.

530
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:25,934
- And stop staring at her.
- I'm not staring at nobody.

531
00:43:25,934 --> 00:43:27,614
I was contemplating the following -

532
00:43:27,614 --> 00:43:30,214
perhaps I could pay off my debt
by working for you,

533
00:43:30,214 --> 00:43:33,414
say... mmm, oooh-eee, oooh...
one day a week?

534
00:43:33,414 --> 00:43:35,374
- And that day is today.
- Today?

535
00:43:35,374 --> 00:43:37,374
- Yes.
- Oh! How exciting.

536
00:43:37,374 --> 00:43:38,854
I have 19 more pools.

537
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:41,854
Help me get done and I guarantee
you'll make a big dent in your debt.

538
00:43:41,854 --> 00:43:45,214
I accept the gig.
Wherever you go, I go, Huggo.

539
00:43:45,214 --> 00:43:46,694
In the back with Floyd.

540
00:43:46,694 --> 00:43:49,971
How exciting.
It is... it is my pleasure!

541
00:43:52,294 --> 00:43:55,286
- Hello, gimpy.
- Hello.

542
00:43:58,774 --> 00:44:00,208
Thanks.

543
00:44:09,974 --> 00:44:12,374
If I win tonight,
I'm going to buy you a new truck.

544
00:44:12,374 --> 00:44:14,012
Can you buy me a new dress?

545
00:44:21,814 --> 00:44:25,374
In my last previous life,
I was reborn...

546
00:44:25,374 --> 00:44:27,974
... in... Amsterdam -

547
00:44:27,974 --> 00:44:30,124
right in the middle of the red-light district.

548
00:44:31,374 --> 00:44:34,844
I was raised by a whore, you see?
Before it was hip.

549
00:44:36,334 --> 00:44:39,334
Huggo's mother is a beauty of a whore.

550
00:44:39,334 --> 00:44:43,734
Isn't she? She's like her daughter.
They're both... they're both whores.

551
00:44:43,734 --> 00:44:45,934
Both...

552
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:47,732
- Both of them, they...
- Follow my finger.

553
00:44:56,254 --> 00:45:00,754
Dammit! You freak!

554
00:45:00,814 --> 00:45:03,174
Hey! Don't make me separate you two.

555
00:45:03,174 --> 00:45:05,574
Please, please.

556
00:45:05,574 --> 00:45:08,414
I'm not doing anything unruly.
I'm not making any waves.

557
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,654
It's not my style, Huggo.

558
00:45:12,134 --> 00:45:14,250
Your mama's so lovely.
I wish she were my mama.

559
00:45:15,294 --> 00:45:17,294
What is the matter with you?

560
00:45:17,294 --> 00:45:21,492
Well, you don't... know what it's like
not to have anybody.

561
00:45:23,414 --> 00:45:26,414
I want to be a part of your family.
Is that OK?

562
00:45:26,414 --> 00:45:28,614
Uh, well, we're totally dysfunctional.

563
00:45:28,614 --> 00:45:30,730
Huh. Not to me!

564
00:45:33,454 --> 00:45:37,454
I'm... bewitched by your mama!

565
00:45:37,454 --> 00:45:40,614
Let me lay some pipe in your madre!

566
00:45:46,534 --> 00:45:48,445
- Hi, Irwin.
- Hi. How are you?

567
00:45:50,574 --> 00:45:52,454
- Good.
- How much is in there?

568
00:45:52,454 --> 00:45:55,734
Zip. Nada. Nothing. Zero.
Put it in your pocket.

569
00:45:55,734 --> 00:45:58,734
If there's nothing,
how are we going to settle up?

570
00:45:58,734 --> 00:46:01,094
We saddle up at my place later.

571
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:03,694
But very late.
I've got a tip on a horse running tonight.

572
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,694
Hey, book it with me. Skip the track.

573
00:46:05,694 --> 00:46:08,094
Then we can be together early.

574
00:46:08,094 --> 00:46:10,094
I can't. I've got to be there live.

575
00:46:10,094 --> 00:46:12,694
I've got to get down.
I mean, I've got to get down.

576
00:46:12,694 --> 00:46:16,414
Look, you know I'm no good for
what you want till after the race anyway.

577
00:46:16,414 --> 00:46:18,694
I can control myself till later.

578
00:46:18,694 --> 00:46:21,129
It's not easy, but I can do it.

579
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,614
Hey, wh...what's the horse's name?

580
00:46:24,614 --> 00:46:28,014
I can't tell you that, or anybody else,
because of the jinx factor.

581
00:46:28,014 --> 00:46:32,514
Even when you reject me,
I get gaga in my knees.

582
00:46:33,014 --> 00:46:35,094
Second race, Quirky Gait.

583
00:46:35,094 --> 00:46:36,774
Hey, that race is fixed.

584
00:46:36,774 --> 00:46:39,812
Let me call someone,
find out if the horse has a chance.

585
00:46:40,974 --> 00:46:42,408
Irwin...

586
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:45,692
... don't bore me.

587
00:46:55,054 --> 00:46:58,365
Well, I'll cover you in chemicals
and watch you smoulder.

588
00:46:59,854 --> 00:47:02,368
I'll mash your face.

589
00:47:04,974 --> 00:47:06,408
No.

590
00:47:07,454 --> 00:47:09,454
I love you.

591
00:47:09,454 --> 00:47:12,814
Just another one of God's little victims.

592
00:47:12,814 --> 00:47:14,248
Like me.

593
00:47:23,614 --> 00:47:25,534
You didn't pay your bookie, did you?

594
00:47:25,534 --> 00:47:27,014
You got me.

595
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:29,454
At the last minute,
I decided to sleep with him

596
00:47:29,454 --> 00:47:32,414
and keep the money
to place a serious bet on Quirky Gait,

597
00:47:32,414 --> 00:47:34,254
who's going to take me to heaven.

598
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:36,494
Ooh, I'm a little dizzy.

599
00:47:36,494 --> 00:47:38,494
Did you take your shot of insulin today?

600
00:47:38,494 --> 00:47:40,334
Yeah.

601
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:42,734
Huh. Sweetheart,
I don't think you're dizzy.

602
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,854
I think you're falling in love.

603
00:47:44,854 --> 00:47:47,814
One's a murderer
and the other one can't move.

604
00:47:47,814 --> 00:47:49,854
I've seen worse.

605
00:47:49,854 --> 00:47:52,534
Listen, you can't always be so picky.

606
00:47:52,534 --> 00:47:54,094
Maybe.

607
00:47:54,094 --> 00:47:55,894
The one in the chair's kind of cute.

608
00:47:55,894 --> 00:47:57,612
He is, isn't he? He has nice eyes.

609
00:48:01,374 --> 00:48:03,974
I've got to stop. Excuse, please.

610
00:48:03,974 --> 00:48:05,454
What is it?

611
00:48:05,454 --> 00:48:08,494
I'm craving, man. I've got to help myself.

612
00:48:08,494 --> 00:48:09,928
Whatever.

613
00:48:41,574 --> 00:48:43,294
Oooh.

614
00:48:43,294 --> 00:48:46,174
Oh, boy, am I beat, bro.

615
00:48:46,174 --> 00:48:50,327
I don't feel like getting up today.
Will you do me a solid?

616
00:48:51,374 --> 00:48:53,524
Only if you don't get gloomy on me.

617
00:48:54,694 --> 00:48:58,694
Easy for you to say.
You don't have my Jones.

618
00:48:58,694 --> 00:49:01,413
I've got to score. I've got to cop.

619
00:49:09,174 --> 00:49:10,608
What's in that?

620
00:49:11,654 --> 00:49:14,454
It's... it's OK. It's OK.
Ring-dang-doo.

621
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:16,454
I want it. I need it.

622
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,048
I need the ring-dang-doo!

623
00:49:22,214 --> 00:49:25,254
Alright. Are you sure?

624
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:26,892
Very!

625
00:49:27,934 --> 00:49:29,368
Then say it.

626
00:49:31,494 --> 00:49:36,091
The dope in my life... is me.

627
00:49:49,054 --> 00:49:51,614
You got it all.

628
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:54,214
Oooh. Oooh.

629
00:49:54,214 --> 00:49:56,649
Ooh, man. Thank you, man.

630
00:49:57,694 --> 00:49:59,334
Oooh.

631
00:49:59,334 --> 00:50:01,054
Oooh.

632
00:50:01,054 --> 00:50:03,774
Ooh, man. Oooh.

633
00:50:06,774 --> 00:50:12,213
Tell... no... tell my mother I tried.

634
00:50:27,494 --> 00:50:31,994
Even though you're gone,
you're not as far gone as I am.

635
00:50:32,494 --> 00:50:35,694
Muchas gracias, my friend.

636
00:50:35,694 --> 00:50:39,449
May God rest your soul.
You saved me again.

637
00:50:42,494 --> 00:50:44,531
That's very good.

638
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:55,054
Yeah, it's a new therapy.

639
00:50:55,054 --> 00:50:57,774
More than 100 addicts
are trying this technique.

640
00:50:57,774 --> 00:51:00,374
So far, for me, it works.

641
00:51:00,374 --> 00:51:04,874
What I do is, I help my puppet
shoot up too much ring-dang-doo,

642
00:51:05,374 --> 00:51:08,414
and what he does is overdose,

643
00:51:08,414 --> 00:51:10,052
and I survive.

644
00:51:11,374 --> 00:51:13,490
So, that puppet's like
a metaphor for you?

645
00:51:16,814 --> 00:51:20,214
- Exactly.
- That's beautiful.

646
00:51:20,214 --> 00:51:21,852
Yes, it is!

647
00:51:34,214 --> 00:51:36,414
Franz, grab yourself a skimmer
and follow me.

648
00:51:36,414 --> 00:51:38,614
What did you say?!

649
00:51:38,614 --> 00:51:40,694
How dare you talk to me like that?!

650
00:51:40,694 --> 00:51:43,294
All of your resentment
floating towards me

651
00:51:43,294 --> 00:51:45,694
simply because
I have not paid you for five years

652
00:51:45,694 --> 00:51:49,774
is too much of a temptation
for you not to verbally abuse me.

653
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:52,174
Ssssooo...

654
00:51:52,174 --> 00:51:54,814
... I tender you my resignation!

655
00:51:54,814 --> 00:51:56,771
Get out of my truck!

656
00:51:58,094 --> 00:52:00,694
- Get out!
- "Get out of my truck."

657
00:52:00,694 --> 00:52:02,924
You see what I mean?

658
00:52:05,214 --> 00:52:08,923
It has been a pleasure
not working with you.

659
00:52:13,854 --> 00:52:15,606
Come on, kid. Let's get this one.

660
00:52:19,814 --> 00:52:21,612
Long time no see.

661
00:52:41,014 --> 00:52:43,005
How many times you been in love?

662
00:52:45,814 --> 00:52:47,294
Once.

663
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:49,524
- What was she like?
- Oh, she was very funny.

664
00:52:51,094 --> 00:52:52,528
Where is she now?

665
00:52:53,574 --> 00:52:55,008
No more questions.

666
00:53:01,654 --> 00:53:05,488
My father was a drunk
who somehow managed to get to work.

667
00:53:07,254 --> 00:53:10,565
My mother sold her body for cocktails
in the neighbourhood bar.

668
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:14,168
I'm sorry.

669
00:53:16,774 --> 00:53:18,208
It's nothing.

670
00:54:49,574 --> 00:54:51,008
Whoo!

671
00:55:15,294 --> 00:55:16,728
¡Arriba!

672
00:55:22,854 --> 00:55:24,288
'Bye!

673
00:55:30,334 --> 00:55:31,768
Whoo!

674
00:56:12,014 --> 00:56:15,848
There are those that would say
he was just an extra.

675
00:56:18,014 --> 00:56:20,324
He was more than just an extra.

676
00:56:21,974 --> 00:56:24,974
Every time
he stepped in front of a camera...

677
00:56:24,974 --> 00:56:28,614
... he upgraded the quality
of the background...

678
00:56:28,614 --> 00:56:32,892
... by being serious...
and totally in the moment.

679
00:56:34,134 --> 00:56:37,889
Eugene was the essence of atmosphere.

680
00:56:39,574 --> 00:56:43,533
His background
was everybody's foreground.

681
00:56:45,934 --> 00:56:47,414
He will be missed.

682
00:57:11,934 --> 00:57:16,434
At this point, each of you can take
a shovel, or your hands, if you'd prefer,

683
00:57:17,254 --> 00:57:21,754
and take as much of God's good earth
as you wish...

684
00:57:21,894 --> 00:57:23,694
... and drop it on Eugene,

685
00:57:23,694 --> 00:57:27,688
for it is the last and final good
you can do for him on this earth.

686
00:57:31,734 --> 00:57:33,734
Hello! Hello, peoples.

687
00:57:33,734 --> 00:57:35,854
It is Franz Mazur.

688
00:57:35,854 --> 00:57:38,846
I'm the reason your son is a doornail!

689
00:57:41,974 --> 00:57:43,612
- May I?
- Yes.

690
00:57:52,854 --> 00:57:54,534
It was the least I could do.

691
00:57:54,534 --> 00:57:57,134
As an extra,
your boy was very disciplined,

692
00:57:57,134 --> 00:58:01,634
but as a man, he was so abrasive
that there was no way out for my pistol.

693
00:58:02,054 --> 00:58:04,534
- Mr Mazur.
- Yes, madre?

694
00:58:04,534 --> 00:58:06,334
My husband and I
would like to adopt you.

695
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:08,814
- We're serious, Franz.
- About what?

696
00:58:08,814 --> 00:58:12,454
We're here forever for you, my son.

697
00:58:12,454 --> 00:58:14,134
We love you, Franz.

698
00:58:14,134 --> 00:58:16,134
What did you say, Mother?

699
00:58:16,134 --> 00:58:18,694
You are a part of this family.

700
00:58:22,654 --> 00:58:24,654
I'm happy to be a part of anything.

701
00:58:24,654 --> 00:58:26,134
Oh!

702
00:58:26,134 --> 00:58:28,454
- Is they real, Mommy?
- They're real, darling.

703
00:58:28,454 --> 00:58:30,854
- Oh, you're my mommy!
- Oh!

704
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:33,294
It's OK.

705
00:58:33,294 --> 00:58:35,854
- Oh, yes.
- It's alright now.

706
00:58:38,134 --> 00:58:40,414
Our destination
is right around the corner.

707
00:58:40,414 --> 00:58:42,564
2533 Lemaline Lane.

708
00:58:43,614 --> 00:58:45,294
Get ready for delivery.

709
00:58:45,294 --> 00:58:48,093
You're going to meet my daughter
and Mr Chicalini.

710
00:58:49,214 --> 00:58:50,648
Stop.

711
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,654
Stop. Please stop.

712
00:58:53,654 --> 00:58:55,654
Stop. Stop.

713
00:58:55,654 --> 00:58:57,088
Stop.

714
00:59:06,734 --> 00:59:08,884
I don't want to meet anybody new.

715
01:01:22,494 --> 01:01:24,174
Do you mind?

716
01:01:25,654 --> 01:01:27,134
Grazie.

717
01:01:40,414 --> 01:01:42,214
Mr Chicalini!

718
01:01:42,214 --> 01:01:43,887
This is my mother, Minerva.

719
01:01:45,614 --> 01:01:48,014
I see where you got your bone structure.

720
01:01:48,014 --> 01:01:49,654
Who's the cat in the chair?

721
01:01:49,654 --> 01:01:51,334
Floyd Gaylen, new customer.

722
01:01:51,334 --> 01:01:54,014
- Should I care?
- Don't even think about it.

723
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:56,574
- Where's your father?
- He'll be along.

724
01:02:01,374 --> 01:02:04,494
I'm going to pull a switcheroo.

725
01:02:04,494 --> 01:02:06,132
So, let's party.

726
01:02:14,934 --> 01:02:16,414
No, thank you.

727
01:02:16,414 --> 01:02:19,854
- Oh, take a sip.
- Nah. I don't drink.

728
01:02:19,854 --> 01:02:22,054
- Take a sip.
- No!

729
01:02:22,054 --> 01:02:24,125
Don't show disrespect.

730
01:02:52,774 --> 01:02:55,574
Mr Chicalini, this is my father.

731
01:02:55,574 --> 01:02:58,454
- Hi.
- Hey, your daughter is the best.

732
01:02:58,454 --> 01:03:00,934
Well, it's very nice to meet you,
Mr Chicalini.

733
01:03:00,934 --> 01:03:04,534
Henry Dugay.
I'm ready to put the goods into your pool.

734
01:03:04,534 --> 01:03:07,094
Let's unleash the aqua. Alright.

735
01:03:08,654 --> 01:03:12,414
You know, Hugo,
now, he doesn't remember, but...

736
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:16,614
... one night your father shared
some of his ring-dang-doo with me.

737
01:03:16,614 --> 01:03:19,891
Whoa! What a batch that was. Yo!

738
01:03:22,334 --> 01:03:25,334
Hey, look, Hugo, I'm sorry. I...

739
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:28,294
Listen, I tell you what. Forget the water.

740
01:03:28,294 --> 01:03:32,094
It's not the fine,
but if I get caught, I'm a three-time loser.

741
01:03:32,094 --> 01:03:35,094
Forget it.
Forget the water?

742
01:03:35,094 --> 01:03:39,334
All day I've been uptight
about you and your water,

743
01:03:39,334 --> 01:03:41,694
and now you cancel?

744
01:03:41,694 --> 01:03:43,128
Fuck you.

745
01:03:45,094 --> 01:03:48,094
Oh, no, no, wait. Hugo, here.

746
01:03:48,094 --> 01:03:49,574
- No way.
- Oh, come on.

747
01:03:49,574 --> 01:03:51,774
You did the job. You deserve it. Take it!

748
01:03:51,774 --> 01:03:53,654
Not until the water is in the pool.

749
01:03:53,654 --> 01:03:55,334
Take it!

750
01:03:55,334 --> 01:03:57,374
No.

751
01:04:02,974 --> 01:04:04,612
Hey. No water!

752
01:04:06,094 --> 01:04:07,528
Take it, please.

753
01:04:09,814 --> 01:04:11,814
- I don't want closure.
- Do you ever shut up?

754
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:13,814
Mr Chicalini is right.

755
01:04:13,814 --> 01:04:15,814
Water in his pool is wrong.

756
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:17,294
Who asked you?

757
01:04:17,294 --> 01:04:19,694
A great decision is a great decision.

758
01:04:19,694 --> 01:04:22,174
And no water in the pool is right.

759
01:04:22,174 --> 01:04:23,654
I don't believe this.

760
01:04:23,654 --> 01:04:26,854
Mr Chicaliniis entitled
to change his mind.

761
01:04:26,854 --> 01:04:32,133
That's it. No water. You hear me?
What are you, stupid?

762
01:04:34,174 --> 01:04:36,774
Is that your mother over there?

763
01:04:36,774 --> 01:04:39,766
She looks good. She's lost some weight.

764
01:04:41,534 --> 01:04:44,534
Hey, Min! It's Henry.

765
01:04:44,534 --> 01:04:48,534
If no water's going in, let's split.
Track, now!

766
01:04:48,534 --> 01:04:50,574
Hugo, put the hose away.

767
01:04:50,574 --> 01:04:53,532
I'd like to put you away.

768
01:04:55,614 --> 01:04:56,570
Whoa.

769
01:04:59,534 --> 01:05:01,207
What's your horse, bro?

770
01:05:02,334 --> 01:05:03,814
Quirky Gait.

771
01:05:03,814 --> 01:05:06,294
Quirky Gait.

772
01:05:06,294 --> 01:05:08,134
Feels like a winner to me.

773
01:05:08,134 --> 01:05:09,614
Oh, no.

774
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:13,654
May I join you guys?

775
01:05:13,654 --> 01:05:17,694
Well, you're going to have to now,
Henry, otherwise you're going to jinx me.

776
01:05:17,694 --> 01:05:19,174
Hugo, we're going to be late!

777
01:05:19,174 --> 01:05:21,974
The hell with the real track.
Just get me down to satellite wagering.

778
01:05:21,974 --> 01:05:24,534
I have a problem. I have a problem.

779
01:05:24,534 --> 01:05:27,413
This young man has a problem.

780
01:05:28,894 --> 01:05:30,328
Move, Henry.

781
01:05:33,894 --> 01:05:36,374
- Get me on my feet and hold me up.
- What?

782
01:05:36,374 --> 01:05:38,374
There's a whiz coming.

783
01:05:38,374 --> 01:05:40,574
He has to go to the bathroom.
What's wrong with you?

784
01:05:40,574 --> 01:05:44,533
OK, wait. Oh, for Christ's sake!

785
01:05:46,494 --> 01:05:47,974
OK.
Hang on, hang on.

786
01:05:47,974 --> 01:05:49,654
- Pull him. Pull him up.
- Wait. Wait!

787
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:51,694
- Pull him up!
- Would you fucking help me?!

788
01:05:51,694 --> 01:05:53,174
Right. OK.

789
01:05:53,174 --> 01:05:54,654
OK? Ready?

790
01:05:54,654 --> 01:05:58,094
OK, Hugo, a little help over here!

791
01:05:58,094 --> 01:06:01,254
Henry!

792
01:06:01,254 --> 01:06:03,214
Henry, you got him?

793
01:06:08,334 --> 01:06:09,972
No, it's OK, Hugo. Just do it.

794
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:12,972
OK.

795
01:06:18,014 --> 01:06:20,369
Not only can you pick a horse,
you are a horse.

796
01:06:22,334 --> 01:06:24,414
Hmm. He took his vitamins today.

797
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:25,848
Phew.

798
01:06:28,574 --> 01:06:31,014
Jeez, Floyd, you impress me.

799
01:06:38,214 --> 01:06:40,774
- Shake it. Shake it.
- Oh, Henry!

800
01:06:43,814 --> 01:06:46,124
OK. You alright there, Floyd?

801
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:50,134
Jesus.
He could've filled up my pool.

802
01:06:50,134 --> 01:06:53,854
Enough with the water already!

803
01:06:53,854 --> 01:06:56,494
Hugo, we've got to talk.

804
01:06:56,494 --> 01:06:59,407
It's not about money. This is serious.

805
01:07:00,454 --> 01:07:02,134
What?

806
01:07:02,134 --> 01:07:06,492
Look... Hugo, in a couple of hours,
I'm checking into the...

807
01:07:09,974 --> 01:07:11,408
... Betty Ford Clinic.

808
01:07:22,814 --> 01:07:26,364
<i>The horses for the
second race are coming onto the track.</i>

809
01:07:28,854 --> 01:07:31,448
- 3 don't have a chance.
- Thanks for the tip.

810
01:07:33,094 --> 01:07:36,254
Hey, the fix is in.
Completion Bond is the pick.

811
01:07:36,254 --> 01:07:37,688
Oh, don't jinx me.

812
01:07:53,334 --> 01:07:54,814
Hi, Dad.

813
01:07:54,814 --> 01:07:56,248
- How are you doing, babe?
- Good.

814
01:08:03,134 --> 01:08:06,694
- Min. What are we on here, babe?
- 3.

815
01:08:06,694 --> 01:08:08,924
<i>The horses are lining up.</i>

816
01:08:10,534 --> 01:08:12,534
<i>And they're off</i>

817
01:08:12,534 --> 01:08:14,614
<i>And they're pacing.</i>

818
01:08:14,614 --> 01:08:17,414
<i>Moving out to the front
is Lawrence of Hollywood,</i>

819
01:08:17,414 --> 01:08:20,134
<i>with Failed Marriage an easy second.</i>

820
01:08:20,134 --> 01:08:23,414
<i>Out of Court Jester is coming on strong.</i>

821
01:08:23,414 --> 01:08:26,293
<i>Past him, Quirky Gait,
who stumbles on the inside.</i>

822
01:08:27,334 --> 01:08:30,814
<i>Two lengths back, but moving up,
is Don't Get Involved.</i>

823
01:08:30,814 --> 01:08:33,054
<i>Trying to recover is Quirky Gait...</i>

824
01:08:33,054 --> 01:08:35,054
- Quirky Gait!
- Floyd, I believe in you!

825
01:08:35,054 --> 01:08:36,774
Oh, he's got no chance!

826
01:08:36,774 --> 01:08:38,974
- Quiet!
- <i>Up ahead is Out of Court Jester...</i>

827
01:08:38,974 --> 01:08:40,814
- Don't jinx it!
- <i>... overtaken by Don't Get Involved...</i>

828
01:08:40,814 --> 01:08:43,854
- It's over, Ma.
- <i>... with Failed Marriage a close second.</i>

829
01:08:43,854 --> 01:08:45,654
Go, you stupid horse!

830
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:47,334
- What are you doing?!
- <i>On the far out side...</i>

831
01:08:47,334 --> 01:08:49,894
- He's... he's... he's last!
- Come on, now. Give him a chance.

832
01:08:49,894 --> 01:08:51,374
Give him a chance!

833
01:08:51,374 --> 01:08:54,174
<i>Now Quirky Gait is starting
to make a serious move.</i>

834
01:08:54,174 --> 01:08:56,534
- Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

835
01:08:56,534 --> 01:08:58,374
Come on, you fat bastard! Move!

836
01:08:58,374 --> 01:09:01,294
<i>And Failed Marriage taking out a lead.</i>

837
01:09:01,294 --> 01:09:03,614
Go! Run!

838
01:09:03,614 --> 01:09:05,814
- Dammit! Run your fucking heart out!
- Let's go!

839
01:09:05,814 --> 01:09:07,294
<i>They're starting to bunch up.</i>

840
01:09:07,294 --> 01:09:08,454
Go! Go!

841
01:09:08,454 --> 01:09:11,774
- <i>Quirky Gait is pulling up fast.</i>
- Whip him!

842
01:09:11,774 --> 01:09:15,294
<i>And now Quirky Gait
passes Lawrence of Hollywood.</i>

843
01:09:15,294 --> 01:09:17,494
Here we go! Here we go!

844
01:09:17,494 --> 01:09:19,174
Come on! Come on, Quirky!

845
01:09:19,174 --> 01:09:22,014
<i>Don't Get Involved and Failed Marriage
kicking them back...</i>

846
01:09:22,014 --> 01:09:24,294
Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

847
01:09:24,294 --> 01:09:27,094
Alright, he's got it. He's got it.
Get out of the way, goddammit!

848
01:09:27,094 --> 01:09:28,574
<i>...the final turn.</i>

849
01:09:28,574 --> 01:09:31,934
<i>Here comes Quirky Gait like a cyclone.</i>

850
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:33,414
<i>Down the stretch...</i>

851
01:09:33,414 --> 01:09:35,654
Come on. Come on, Quirky Gait!
Make me rich!

852
01:09:35,654 --> 01:09:38,334
- Take me to heaven!
- You're damn right.

853
01:09:38,334 --> 01:09:40,974
<i>...and now goes by Don't Get Involved.</i>

854
01:09:40,974 --> 01:09:42,654
<i>It's down to these three.</i>

855
01:09:42,654 --> 01:09:44,088
He's coming! Look!

856
01:09:45,134 --> 01:09:47,014
<i>200 yards to go.</i>

857
01:09:47,014 --> 01:09:50,494
<i>And out of nowhere,
here comes Completion Bond</i>

858
01:09:50,494 --> 01:09:52,374
<i>with a powerful late thrust.</i>

859
01:09:52,374 --> 01:09:54,414
Come on, motherfucker!

860
01:09:54,414 --> 01:09:55,894
<i>It's Quirky Gait.</i>

861
01:09:55,894 --> 01:09:57,574
<i>It's Completion Bond.</i>

862
01:09:57,574 --> 01:10:00,294
<i>It's Quirky Gait!
It's Completion Bond!</i>

863
01:10:00,294 --> 01:10:01,974
- Get him!
- <i>It's...</i>

864
01:10:01,974 --> 01:10:04,174
<i>... Quirky Gait!</i>

865
01:10:04,174 --> 01:10:06,134
Quirky Gait! Quirky Gait!

866
01:10:06,134 --> 01:10:09,094
Yes! Yes!

867
01:10:09,094 --> 01:10:11,051
Yes!

868
01:10:12,094 --> 01:10:14,054
Oh! Oh!

869
01:10:14,054 --> 01:10:16,094
We won! We won!

870
01:10:16,094 --> 01:10:18,694
Oh, I love you! I love you!
I love you! I love you!

871
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:20,774
You guys, I love you guys.

872
01:10:20,774 --> 01:10:23,814
I love you! This is great!

873
01:10:32,694 --> 01:10:35,652
Would you like to have a bite
after the last race?

874
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:39,368
No.

875
01:10:42,134 --> 01:10:46,134
I have never felt this much money
in my whole, entire life!

876
01:10:46,134 --> 01:10:49,694
Floyd, do you have any idea
how much money you just won?

877
01:10:51,894 --> 01:10:55,214
It doesn't matter. It's yours.

878
01:10:55,214 --> 01:10:57,214
No, I can't do that.

879
01:10:57,214 --> 01:10:59,214
How about you give me 20?

880
01:10:59,214 --> 01:11:01,414
That I can do. Thank you.

881
01:11:01,414 --> 01:11:02,894
Hugo?
Uh, no.

882
01:11:02,894 --> 01:11:06,046
Give my share to Dad.
For getting the water today.

883
01:11:08,174 --> 01:11:09,812
Thanks, Miss Dugay.

884
01:11:12,254 --> 01:11:13,688
Here you go, Henry.

885
01:11:20,694 --> 01:11:22,332
Am I flush or what?

886
01:11:27,814 --> 01:11:29,894
Since you're going to outlive me,

887
01:11:29,894 --> 01:11:33,294
will you forgive me
for all the drugs and... bad examples

888
01:11:33,294 --> 01:11:34,728
that I'm leaving you?

889
01:11:37,494 --> 01:11:39,292
That's not who you are anymore, Dad.

890
01:11:40,334 --> 01:11:41,972
You came through today.

891
01:11:45,174 --> 01:11:46,608
Thanks.

892
01:11:48,014 --> 01:11:49,652
I like myself today.

893
01:11:51,694 --> 01:11:53,253
I do.

894
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,654
- Hey, Dad, can you take Mom home?
- Where are you going?

895
01:12:01,654 --> 01:12:04,854
I'm not staying here. One horse
is enough. I've got to take Floyd home.

896
01:12:04,854 --> 01:12:07,054
I'm going to stay
and see if I'm hot or not.

897
01:12:07,054 --> 01:12:10,054
But you guys go. Go ahead.
I mean, I'll get home.

898
01:12:10,054 --> 01:12:12,054
- I loved today.
- Me too.

899
01:12:12,054 --> 01:12:13,734
Finally something happened.

900
01:12:13,734 --> 01:12:15,414
What else can I do for you?

901
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,414
How about taking back the business
for two weeks?

902
01:12:17,414 --> 01:12:18,414
How come?

903
01:12:18,414 --> 01:12:20,774
'Cause I haven't had a weekday off
in years.

904
01:12:20,774 --> 01:12:22,254
You don't mind, do you?

905
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:23,688
You got me.

906
01:12:24,814 --> 01:12:27,134
So, I'll talk to you soon, Ma.

907
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:29,734
- Yeah. I... I'd like that.
- Me too.

908
01:12:29,734 --> 01:12:33,614
Uh... listen...
You're sexy when you win.

909
01:12:33,614 --> 01:12:36,527
- Goodbye, Henry.
- 'Bye, Dad.

910
01:12:40,294 --> 01:12:44,094
Listen, if I wanted to get a tattoo
of Quirky Gait on my boob...

911
01:12:44,094 --> 01:12:45,574
... would you come with me?

912
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:47,054
Really?

913
01:12:47,054 --> 01:12:50,054
I want to have something
to remember this day by.

914
01:12:50,054 --> 01:12:52,250
It was, uh...
well, it was pretty special.

915
01:12:54,734 --> 01:12:56,372
Yeah, I could make that happen.

916
01:13:05,774 --> 01:13:07,208
Here he is.

917
01:13:10,974 --> 01:13:13,774
Hmm. I see good things
coming for you.

918
01:13:13,774 --> 01:13:16,774
Quirky Gait.
Do I know my business or what?

919
01:13:16,774 --> 01:13:19,974
I mean, that horse was a gift from God,
through Floyd!

920
01:13:19,974 --> 01:13:22,454
Hey, Ma. The gift from God is Floyd.

921
01:13:22,454 --> 01:13:24,764
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

922
01:13:26,774 --> 01:13:28,254
Goodnight, Floyd.

923
01:13:28,254 --> 01:13:30,974
Goodnight, Minerva.

924
01:13:30,974 --> 01:13:35,491
Oh. Hugo, before I forget - 20 big ones.
Go by yourself a dress.

925
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:42,047
- Mmm. I love you.
- I love you too, kiddo.

926
01:13:43,534 --> 01:13:44,968
Thanks.

927
01:13:46,014 --> 01:13:48,014
You ready? Let's go.

928
01:13:48,014 --> 01:13:49,652
Whee!

929
01:14:29,974 --> 01:14:31,487
It's a beautiful night.

930
01:14:32,814 --> 01:14:34,327
It does happen.

931
01:14:36,974 --> 01:14:39,568
What's the foremost thought
you have in your mind?

932
01:14:45,974 --> 01:14:48,374
Today...

933
01:14:48,374 --> 01:14:51,412
... I had more affection coming
from my parents than ever.

934
01:14:54,294 --> 01:14:56,734
It's great when all the other organisms

935
01:14:56,734 --> 01:14:59,374
are exactly linked up
and behave themselves.

936
01:14:59,374 --> 01:15:00,808
Yeah.

937
01:15:03,694 --> 01:15:06,134
I'm more than enchanted
that my time on the planet

938
01:15:06,134 --> 01:15:08,330
has linked up with Hugo Dugay.

939
01:15:11,254 --> 01:15:12,688
Do you really mean that?

940
01:15:14,734 --> 01:15:17,044
Yes, I do.

941
01:15:21,334 --> 01:15:24,292
My arms don't work,
so how about you hug me?

942
01:15:27,334 --> 01:15:28,768
Yes, sir.

943
01:15:40,214 --> 01:15:41,648
Oh...

944
01:15:42,694 --> 01:15:45,413
... thanks for saving my ass
with the water today.

945
01:15:52,454 --> 01:15:55,765
You're...we-l...

946
01:15:57,014 --> 01:15:58,448
What?

947
01:15:59,494 --> 01:16:01,814
You're... wel-come.

948
01:16:24,054 --> 01:16:25,534
Hi, Andy.

949
01:16:25,534 --> 01:16:29,289
- Andy. Yo, Andy.
- We have a house guest.

950
01:16:32,694 --> 01:16:34,374
- Hugo?
- Yeah.

951
01:16:34,374 --> 01:16:35,808
Get the chair.

952
01:19:22,374 --> 01:19:24,126
You gave it your best shot.

953
01:19:45,534 --> 01:19:47,934
- Hugo?
- Hmm?

954
01:19:47,934 --> 01:19:50,334
I'm fixing to go down
to the all-night wax museum,

955
01:19:50,334 --> 01:19:53,734
and I was wondering
if you'd, uh, keep an eye on the boss.

956
01:19:53,734 --> 01:19:56,534
- How can I not?
- Mmm. Thanks.

957
01:19:56,534 --> 01:19:57,968
Have fun.

958
01:20:08,774 --> 01:20:10,208
Hello.

959
01:20:14,094 --> 01:20:15,732
Whew! It's hot.

960
01:20:19,574 --> 01:20:21,534
Ah!

961
01:20:35,934 --> 01:20:37,814
What's this do?

962
01:20:40,014 --> 01:20:41,448
Uh-oh.

963
01:20:42,494 --> 01:20:43,928
Oh...

964
01:22:35,894 --> 01:22:37,328
Hey, Andy.

965
01:24:17,414 --> 01:24:20,814
Huggo. Hello.

966
01:24:20,814 --> 01:24:25,314
Guess what?
Franz has a surprise for you.

967
01:24:25,974 --> 01:24:28,774
I'm going to pay you that what I owe you.

968
01:24:28,774 --> 01:24:32,054
You see, my fire insurance cheque
just bounced in this morning,

969
01:24:32,054 --> 01:24:36,554
and I'm going to cash it
and repay you fully and finally.

970
01:24:37,014 --> 01:24:39,294
Keep it.

971
01:24:39,294 --> 01:24:40,728
Oh, really?

972
01:24:42,254 --> 01:24:45,934
What does this Floyd have
that I don't have?

973
01:24:45,934 --> 01:24:47,368
Me.

974
01:24:49,014 --> 01:24:50,448
Hey.

975
01:24:52,214 --> 01:24:55,172
I'm too superficial to be hurt...

976
01:24:56,374 --> 01:25:00,572
... by that... shallow attempt at feeling.

977
01:25:01,734 --> 01:25:03,168
I feel nothing!

978
01:25:04,814 --> 01:25:07,693
I feel like leaving this neighbourhood.

979
01:25:11,174 --> 01:25:12,608
This place is dead!
