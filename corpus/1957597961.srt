[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,260
In '61 I was lost.

3
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,200
I was looking for myself.

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,670
It's embarrassing to ask me
 what I was doing in 1961.

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,840
Oh, well I met Mo
 Saltzman of course.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,370
Mo was a compelling guy.

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,830
He was short, heavy,
 stocky, heavy,

8
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,960
strong though, and very agile.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,890
I mean he moved beautifully.

10
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,580
He was this kind of
 intense short little guy

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,620
with big ideas, talked a mile
 a minute, very philosophical,

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,800
a real impresario.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,650
He says well listen,
 I'm having a party today.

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,820
Would you like to come?

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,580
We went up to
 this big old house,

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,320
a big old mansion-type house.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,070
It was big, and it was open,
 and it was so California.

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,090
It was out in Chatsworth.

19
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,420
And we went into the
 backyard, and there are quite

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,830
a few odd things going on.

21
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,100
But you have to remember,
 I went to Hollywood High.

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,530
First I saw a couple of
 nude ladies running around.

23
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,880
Next thing I know, something's
 rubbing up against me, and--

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,960
And then some man ran through
 across just the hallway.

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,550
He didn't have a stitch on.

26
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,460
And he had a bone
 on him like this.

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,360
And--

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,000
Everybody started
 kissing and fucking.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,820
And I got caught up in it.

30
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,420
I just got caught up in it.

31
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,770
Breasts and assholes and balls.

32
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,210
Men on top of men.

33
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,110
There were women
 on top of women.

34
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,110
Sometimes it was two.

35
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,720
Sometimes it was three.

36
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,500
Imagine having six or seven
 people work on you at one time.

37
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,820
There were like 15 couples
 there, all bunched together,

38
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,990
you know, shtupping away.

39
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,620
It was like a plate of calamari.

40
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,100
I open my eyes and there's
 a camera looking at me.

41
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,690
It might have been
 one of the first

42
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,550
recorded organized,
 quasi-not orgy

43
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,240
orgies that came out of Mo.

44
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,870
The things I did that day, that
 I'm not particularly proud of.

45
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,990
But there's nothing
 I wouldn't do

46
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,800
for a good pastrami sandwich.

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I think that was the beginning
 of the Mo Saltzman legend.

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,690
That was the beginning.

49
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,520
I think that afternoon was
 the beginning of everything.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

51
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,260
NARRATOR: Mo Saltzman
 was, without question,

52
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,140
the most influential
 pornographer

53
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,070
of the 20th century.

54
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,880
I mean here's a guy who made
 hundreds of commercially

55
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,600
successful films, from
 fun-loving nudie cuties

56
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,320
to darkly original sexploitation
 films, to his groundbreaking

57
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,960
work in musical pornography.

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,930
But what really separated
 Mo from everyone else

59
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,440
was that he made
 pornos that mattered.

60
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,110
I mean, I remember
 I was 10 years old,

61
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,290
and my Uncle Andy snuck me
 into the Corinthian Theater

62
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,250
there in San Francisco.

63
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,080
I'll never forget it.

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,530
It was a matinee performance
 of a Fistful of Penis.

65
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,670
And it was a revelation.

66
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,680
It was a life
 changing event for me.

67
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,490
I was 10 years old.

68
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,940
I'd seen a lot of porn.

69
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,230
But I had never seen anything
 like a Mo, because no one had.

70
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,120
Mo took the medium
 and he massaged it.

71
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,910
And he was able
 to really address

72
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,410
social and political
 issues of his time.

73
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,100
Now that is Moe.

[HELICOPTER]

75
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,590
We're living the Constitution.

76
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,500
We're-- we're the
 physical and mental

77
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,980
embodiment of our rights, of
 the Bill of Rights, you know?

78
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,800
A kid goes, what does
 these Bill of Rights mean?

79
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,680
You can point them to the
 porn industry and show them,

80
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,250
this is what the
 Bill of Rights are.

81
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,300
These are why our Founding
 Fathers did what they did.

82
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,750
Is so that we could sit
 in our own living rooms

83
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,620
and masturbate to the
 movie of our choice,

84
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,140
whether it be pornography
 or the Sound of Music.

85
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,170
NARRATOR: In 1967,
 Saltzman broke

86
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,730
pornography's color barrier with
 guess who's coming on dinner.

87
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,340
It featured the industry's
 first interracial Dirty Sanchez.

88
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,110
And in 1987, Mo
 buoyed up the spirits

89
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,460
of the entire handicap
 porn community

90
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,010
by directing Pile
 Driving Miss Daisy.

91
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,300
Oh, you're so thick.

92
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,800
NARRATOR: This was the first
 ever for the hearing impaired.

93
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,290
Fuck me!
 Fuck me!

94
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,620
The handicapped porn consumer
 had largely been ignored.

95
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,230
There was a little
 bit of amputee porn,

96
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,720
the Stump Fucker Series.

97
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,620
But if you were
 blind or a retard,

98
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,710
where do you go for your porn?

99
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,300
NARRATOR: In the '70s and
 -80s, Saltzman subtly tweaked

100
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,730
the political establishment
 with his Pap Smears,

101
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,470
political action pornos.

102
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,990
The issues we're trying to
 address, like the environment,

103
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,840
you know, we made a movie about
 the hole in the ozone layer.

104
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,420
The ozone layer is a very
 important layer to have.

105
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,020
And there shouldn't
 be a hole in it.

00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,880
[MUSIC PLAYING]

107
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,740
Sweet.

108
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,700
Yeah, I'll meet you at
 your place later, baby.

109
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,750
That's right.

How could you?

113
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,200
That's an aerosol cooking spray.

114
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,400
What, this?

115
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,890

How do we turn Sheila on?

-Act locally, think globally.
 -Right.

Yes, yes.

121
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,220
When Mo died in
 the spring of 2007,

122
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,720
he left such a gaping
 hole in the porn industry.

123
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,110
Hundreds of porn stars had
 lost a beloved father figure.

124
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,100
And porn fans across
 the world, they

125
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,150
lost the thrill of
 ever seeing a new Mo

126
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,880
Saltzman production again.

127
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,800
Until they found out
 there was one film left.

128
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,180
Well I'd been working in Europe
 for the past couple years.

129
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,860
So I was in Saint
 Tropez, directing

130
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,380
second unit on a car campaign,
 when I heard about Mo's death.

131
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:04,150
The next day a trunk
 arrives at my hotel.

132
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,240
It was a steamer trunk
 of Mo's that the Estate

133
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,450
had delivered to me.

134
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,360
When I opened that trunk
 and saw what was inside,

135
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,540
it was one of those moments
 that you know your life

136
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,260
will never be the same.

137
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,660
It was a script called
 Dial M for Milkjugs,

138
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,550
with storyboards, pages
 and pages of notes.

139
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,600
It had been a project he'd been
 working on for years and years

140
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,930
and years, and wanted
 to make, and never

141
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,530
got the chance to make.

142
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:35,140
And it was in his will
 that if he passed before he

143
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,870
got a chance to do
 it, that he wanted

144
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,360
me to take over the project.

145
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,770
I quit my job the next day,
 flew back to the states,

146
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,930
called everybody on the cast.

147
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,800
They're all on board.

148
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,780
It's going to star a dream
 team of porn superstars

149
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,230
from across the generations.

150
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,520
Everybody in the business
 wanted to be in this picture.

151
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,290
But Mo hand-picked
 the cast himself.

152
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,600
And he picked the best.

153
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,040
NARRATOR: Coming out of
 retirement for this shoot

154
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,910
will be Mo's
 favorite leading lady

155
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,630
of the '70s, Lynette Kelly.

156
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,120
A couple of friends and I went
 to see this Joe Cocker concert,

157
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,260
and Mo Saltzman was there.

158
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,670
And we began talking
 and sort of struck up

159
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,330
an immediate friendship.

160
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,620
And he invited me to
 watch them shoot the film

161
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,040
that he was working
 on at the time,

162
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,010
which was COCK-A-Doodle-DON'T.

163
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,940
I was impressed by how everyone
 was really Mo's family.

164
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,700
I asked Mo right there how
 I could be a part of it.

165
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,580
And so he put me in a
 scene with Bud Hurley.

166
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,480
-Fuck.
 -Yeah.

167
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,000
LYNETTE KELLY: Bud
 Hurley was the master.

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,860
He read your body like a
 blind man reads a novel.

169
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:52,320
He could not only make
 you have an orgasm,

170
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,470
but others watching it would
 have orgasms simultaneously.

171
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:01,020
Most people don't get a
 chance to relive their youth,

172
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,950
you know?

173
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,010
But I'm getting that chance.

174
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,080

That's what she does best.

350
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,240
I've really enjoyed
 working with Gretchen,

351
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,120
because I feel like
 Gretchen understands

352
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,030
what it's like to be a man.
 -Thanks a lot.

353
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,730
Keep it moving.

354
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,570
And I understand what
 it's like to be a woman.

355
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,970
-I'm Carrie.
 -Gretchen.

356
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:53,800
I'm Gretchen.

357
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,280
I got a little flustered.

358
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,920
And so what's gone into this
 strange marriage of a shemale

359
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,010
and a female in business--

360
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,480
Let me put it this way.

361
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,410
I work in business.

362
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,220
I know what it's like
 to be fucked up the ass.

363
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,720
And so does she.

364
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,210
Well it's hard to
 believe, but Mo Saltzman

365
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,050
never won a Peevie Award.

366
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,730
Now it's one of my personal
 goals to get Mo a Peevie.

367
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,230
The deadline for
 submissions is in 10 days.

368
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,220
But that will not be
 a problem, because we

369
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,660
have the best producers in the
 business, the best of the best.

370
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,490
-You're doing great.
 -Just show me again.

371
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,910
Just do it again.
 -Sweetie, look.

372
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,460
NARRATOR: Life partners Ted
 Haynes and Andre Cox will

373
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:41,120
be producing in the 1990s they
 starred in a series of wildly

374
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,890
original homoerotic films.

375
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,610
Titles as varied as The
 Crack of Dawn, Taste of Seth,

376
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,370
and of course, Howard's End.

377
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,750
We decided to have a
 baby about two years ago,

378
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,060
and we did a
 computer progression

379
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,940
of what one could
 look like if we

380
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,290
actually could mix our genes.

381
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,100
Which you can't.

382
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,000
But the computer
 progression is--

383
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,650
it looked strangely
 looked like Charles

384
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,860
Nelson Reilly or Kevin Costner.

385
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,160
It was weird.

386
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,990
I'm pulling for
 Costner, personally.

387
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,990
Yeah, hello.

388
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,580
But with Charles
 Nelson Reilly's talent.

389
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,790
Put that phone down or
 I'll break your leg.

390
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,090
Mac Hollister called us, and
 he said he had the script.

391
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,260
Ted's grandmother luckily
 left him some money,

392
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,900
so getting the money together
 was actually pretty easy.

393
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,730
And it's so exciting.

394
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,380
We're casting our
 bread upon the water,

395
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,190
and it's going to
 come back 100-fold.

396
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,580
And hopefully not come
 back as soggy bread.

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,030
Andre and I just
 saw your last film.

399
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,470
Your clitoris is adorable.
 -Thanks.

No, hi.
 Mac Hollister.

She is the mother
 of my third kid.

Oh, how wonderful.

-Hey.
 -Hi.

00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:07,620
-How about that, our two stars.
 -It's so--

-My hand's in my hair.
 -OK.

How are you?

415
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,840
Good to see you.
 -Hi Gretchen.

Your necklace is so beautiful.
 It's--

Oh, hey.

00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,770
-What's wrong?
 -Oh.

419
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,990
Don't touch it, or
 maybe look at it.

420
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,990
It's a synergy wave pendant.

421
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,930
Synergy.

422
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,710
It is so beautiful.

423
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,420
It was the anal beads
 of the first pope.

424
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,460
-That's what you told.
 -Really?

425
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,900

I do a lot of stuff on the ball.

 have you seen Marty?

Is he coming today?

Oh he's in.

 he's just busy with work.

Well just submit the receipt.

---what they do for that?

00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,740
in the San Fernando Valley,
 which was affectionately

501
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,140
known as the Love Shack.

 the perfect porno house,

this was it.

 hot tubs, three dungeons,

 a Turkish prison, an Afghani

 a douche room, and enema room,

 spirit schmeared all over.

Family's always been very
 important to me, you know?

And I think I've created a
 family here at the Love Shack,

511
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,040
you know?
 I consider us all a family.

512
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,240
It's a different kind of family.

513
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,290
It's a family that has
 sex with each other,

514
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,690
and puts it on film.

 great little script here.

 we can do with it.

00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,340
I just-- well now that
 we're filming together,

700
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,190
I thought we could be
 like sisters or something.

701
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,240
Because we're going
 to get so close.

702
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,190
Oh.
 Yeah.

703
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,980
Maybe we could go for a waxing.

704
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,470
Oh.

705
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,780
Are you Greek?

706
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:18,600
You know, Whitney's a little
 bit different than I expected.

707
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,970
A little bit meaner.

708
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:26,990
And kind of anti-Greek,
 so-- but you know,

709
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,680
I'm not going to
 stoop to her level.

710
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,890
I'm just not.

711
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:32,860
Does it ever hurt your
 feelings that no one, you know,

712
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,830
wants to have sex with
 you from the front?

MO SALTZMAN: My
 great grandfather,

714
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,230
he made a feature in
 the-- it was 1897,

715
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,250
called Cousin
 Myrtle Blows a Kiss.

716
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,270
I was shown this movie
 at a very young age.

717
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,420
And I wanted to
 make my own movies.

718
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,370
And that's how I
 got the bug for it.

719
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,700
I was so inspired I
 hung a production still

720
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,400
from Cousin Myrtle on the
 wall of the Love Shack.

721
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,610
And I look at it for
 inspiration before every shoot.

Pretty girl pictures are stills

725
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,450
It's probably one of my
 favorite parts of the job,

 catch the actresses

Because I'm not
 going to pay for that.

No, I am not going to pay
 you for pink flagstone

00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,480
when I ordered grey flagstone.

750
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,110
Because I specifically
 remember ordering.

Oh, OK, that's the problem.

You don't answer to Doug.

You answer to me, Debbie.

755
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,570
It all started two years ago.

756
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,220
We decided to do an
 addition to the house.

757
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,620
It was going to
 be really simple.

758
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,890
We were going to add
 an office, a home

759
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,930
office so people didn't
 have to go through our house

760
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,810
to consult with.

761
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,480
And then Doug got
 his hands on it.

762
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,470
I wanted to give
 her her own space.

763
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,140
I basically wanted to be
 like Winston Churchill

764
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,450
when he went to India.

765
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,810
I wanted to build
 her a Taj Mahal.

766
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,350
And then he came
 up with more ideas.

767
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,750
And then he came up
 with the idea of well,

768
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:51,180
if we have more clients,
 we need a bigger garage.

769
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,680
And why don't we make
 an octagonal garage?

770
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,860
So I tore it down and
 I put in eight sides.

771
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,410
Which is a bitch.

772
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,770
That was Jose Luis
 just right there.

773
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,570
That was Jose Luis.

774
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,390
He's taking over the job.
 -All right.

775
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:04,290
Wait.
 I have one question for you.

776
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,170
Come on.

777
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,120
And that is, why?

778
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,050
-Because you're inept, OK?
 -I'm adept?

779
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:09,140
That's a good thing.
 I'm adept.

780
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,490
No, inept.
 Not adept.

781
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:14,370
And then I got on
 this thing about not

782
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,590
using gasoline powered
 vehicles to move things.

783
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,940
And I hired some mules.

784
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,870
Then one of the mules
 died, which set me back.

785
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,750
Mules are very
 sensitive to the heat.

786
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,500
And I thought they always
 used them in the desert,

787
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,280
so I thought, you know,
 maybe they were like a camel.

788
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,680
But they're not like a camel.

789
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,410
A camel and a mule are
 entirely different things.

790
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,930
Point is, it became too much.

791
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,520
And I was overwhelmed.

792
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,790
The cost was skyrocketing.

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,230
We started fighting
 all the time,

794
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,830
because we didn't
 have the money.

795
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:48,590
So we're getting a divorce.

 last experience together.

 a resilient muscle.

Or the heart is the
 most resilient muscle.

 resonance throughout society,

876
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,250
that everybody remembers exactly
 where they were when they

877
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,160
first heard about that event.

878
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,320
And I think that
 right up on that list

879
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,690
would be November
 22nd, 1999, on the set

All we really know is that in
 a routine double penetration

882
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:55,720
scene, Jerry and Marty Sphincter
 accidentally touched tips.

883
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,270
This was a maneuver
 that they'd done before.

884
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:01,490
They'd done it 100 times, 1,000
 times, maybe a million times.

885
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,600
Nothing had ever happened.

886
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,780
And that collision
 was later the subject

887
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:14,400

00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,850

But slow the footage
 down, and the images

Frame 75, Jerry and
 Marty begin performing

893
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,980

 with Jerry assuming position

894
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,540
two, of the classic cowgirl
 poses, while Marty punishes

895
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:38,310
La Cienagas anus from behind.

 the signature handshake.

Jerry counters with
 a move that made him

00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:51,970
famous, the bunny ears.

00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,290

 pillows, setting off

901
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,460
a disastrous chain of events.

902
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,700

 45 degrees to his right

903

Help me.

913
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:57,180
It affected me deeply
 because we had just

914
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:01,090
lost a really wonderful presence
 in the adult entertainment

915
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,310
industry, you know?

Lots of people can
 screw on camera.

But very few people
 can make it sing,

00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,760
and really just have a smooth,
 easy flow, it seems natural,

919
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,070
it seems very free.

You know, it's like Yo-Yo

00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,120
I mean these guys were good.

923
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,810
I remember exactly where I was
 when the brothers touched tips.

924
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:24,800
I was doing a karaoke, a
 regional championship round,

925
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,230
in Dickinson, North Dakota.

926
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,210
I was doing a Johnny Cash set.

927
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:33,060
And it threw me off,
 threw me off my game,

928
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,410
when I heard about that.

929
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:38,510
I actually came in sixth
 out of seven contests.

You know, people
 say I'm shallow.

931

I've been through

00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,660
I've been through heavy shit.

933
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,390
When I was eight years
 old I was diagnosed

934
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,260
with a rare immune
 deficiency syndrome, OK?

935
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,920
I spent the next eight
 years in a plastic bubble,

936
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,600
no human contact.

937
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,190
Cut to my 17th birthday,
 turns out I was misdiagnosed.

938
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,140
I was just allergic
 to shellfish.

939
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,930
So that was a pisser.

940
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:04,790
But the only day
 I ever cried was

941
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,430
the day I heard the Sphincter
 brothers touched tips.

942
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:12,630
I don't remember a lot of
 what happened right after.

943
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,600
I think I had some
 sort of break.

944
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,960
Some sort of psychotic episode.
 I floated.

945
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,530
I was in a fugue sort of mist.

946
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:25,380
But finally I found myself in
 a cult, the Order of Pegasus.

947
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,470
And it was very intense for me.

948
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,220
And I found a family
 in those people.

949
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,820
And we had created
 a suicide pact.

950
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,250
And unfortunately that morning
 I had a flat tire on my bike.

951
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,650
So I missed that event.

952
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,160
But it was there
 that I discovered

953
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,670
the six stages of grief.

954
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,840
You know, you start off
 with complete denial.

It never happened.

956
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,800
And then the rage
 comes, number two.

957
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,270
Number three is the
 bargaining, which

958
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,860
I didn't really understand.

959
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,960
It was very confusing to me.

960
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,040
So I went up to four for a
 while, which is depression.

961
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,140
But who wants to be depressed?

962
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,250
So I went back to one for a
 little while and just denied.

963
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,230

 had to hit two again.

 is accepting, which I'm

And of course banjo, the last.

 one, with a little bit of two

 around if he-- I think he's

00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,270
-OK.
 -I'm doing great.

1050
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,220
I found out-- easy there.

1051
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,250
-There you go.
 -Easy Kitty.

1052
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,120
Spread them a little bit.

1053
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,370
I found a buyer for my kidney,
 so I'm working out that deal.

1054
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,070
No mom.

1055
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:04,070
I'm not bringing anyone
 home for Yom Kippur.

1056
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,970
Because it's not a festive
 holiday, that's why.

1057
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:09,630
Ma, people don't even eat.

1058
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,970
You know, well I
 find it depressing.

1059
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:14,400
Can I talk to dad
 about this please?

1060
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,100
You know what?

1061
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,590
I'm sorry, I've got
 to call you back.

1062
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:18,510
-Gretchen, my--
 -What?

1063
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,280
What?
 -My synergy wave pendant.

1064
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,840
My synergy wave pendant's gone.
 -Your pendant?

1065
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,300
It's gone.
 It's gone.

1066
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,100
Where did you leave it?

1067
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,420
Where did you put it?

1068
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,830
The last time I had
 it I was wearing it.

1069
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,040
And that zip-a-dee-doo-dah
 was looking at it.

1070
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,740
And she--

1071
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,790
Wait, wait, wait,
 wait, wait, Hallie?

1072
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,110
-Yes.
 -Oh wait, is she--

1073
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,570
-She had--
 -I can't randomly accuse--

1074
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,670
She stole it.
 ---someone.

1075
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,200
She stole it.
 It's not random.

1076
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,320
It's not random.

1077
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,750
Are you sure, because
 if you're not sure--

1078
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:42,510
Gretchen I'm so sure.

1079
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,790
There are two things
 that I am more

1080
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,330
sure of than anything else.

1081
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,960
OK, what?

1082
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:55,090
One is, you are
 going to find a man.

1083
00:42:55,090 --> 00:43:02,520
And the second thing is,
 Hallie Lujah took my pendant.

1084
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,960
And I need it back.

1085
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,350
I'll take care of it.

1086
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,040
So I'm like, you've got
 your schnitzel in my strudel.

1087
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,530
-I love your accent.
 -Yeah.

1088
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:15,840
-It's fantastic.
 -OK.

1089
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,100
So I'll come in to this.

1090
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,240
So you're down first?

1091
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,720
You come on top of me.

1092
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,220
OK, so I'm in the back, right?

1093
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,640
-This is our specialty.
 -Awesome.

1094
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:22,880
OK.

1095
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,880
And then I'm going like this.

1096
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,580
I get under, right?

1097
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,230
-You come in here somewhere.
 -I've got it.

1098
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,550
Let me just get under.
 -This is great.

1099
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,230
-OK, so--
 -Ow.

1100
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,940
Oh, you know what?
 Hold on.

1101
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,330
One second.
 -Wait just a second.

1102
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,270
-Hold on.
 -Hey.

1103
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:32,970
-Hey.
 -You OK?

1104
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,310
-Yeah.
 -This is going to work well.

1105
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,080
-OK, so then--
 -Can you just give me a minute?

1106
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,170
One second.
 I'll be right back.

1107
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:36,870
No, no.

1108
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,220
All right.

1109
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,910
We're just going to
 stay on sticks for this.

1110
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,340
Hollister, can I talk
 to you for a minute?

1111
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,170
Yeah Marty.
 What is it?

1112
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:48,350
I can't shoot today.

1113
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,250
Well I need you today.

1114
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,180
-Why can't you shoot today?
 -It's Shabbos.

1115
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,870
Shabbos?
 Marty it's Tuesday.

1116
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,870
This whole Marty things
 really freaking me out man.

1117
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:06,170
It's like he's so in
 denial that he can't even

1118
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:07,260
admit the whole thing happened.

1119
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,500
He has no recollection of it.

1120
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,000
It's like OJ Simpson, you know?

1121
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,150
I watched an interview with him.

1122
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,910
And it's like, he
 can't even remember

1123
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,790
he ever even played football.

1124
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,010
What kind of
 toothpaste do you use?

1125
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,730
Crest.

1126
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:23,350
Have you ever shaved
 all your body hair?

1127
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:24,820
Yes, I have.

1128
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:28,020
When I first meet the actor,
 I do like to take a history.

1129
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:28,970
I'll make notes.

1130
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,530
I have questionnaires,
 you know, are

1131
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,900
your parents married, divorced.

1132
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,240
If they were
 spanked as children.

1133
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,740
Great.
 Fantastic.

1134
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,300
Because it makes my
 job so much easier.

1135
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,150
Have you ever played hangman?

1136
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,910
Yes, I have.

1137
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,370
Guess a letter.

1138
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,520
-G.
 -Nope.

1139
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,220
OK.

1140
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,860
This is one of my
 favorite scenes, Whitney.

1141
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,380
This is where we
 establish Ula as this

1142
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,970
really sensuous being through
 her baking the lingonberry pie.

1143
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,770
You've made a pie crust before?

1144
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,640
Ollie, Ollie!

1145
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,790
This is lost!

1146
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,050
Whitney!

1147
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,320
That is outrageous,
 what you've done.

1148
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,600
Hey, hey, what is outrageous?

1149
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,240
You put superglue
 in our mascara.

1150
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,680
I beg your pardon?

1151
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,640
I beg your pardon.

1152
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,110
Why would she put
 superglue in her mascara?

1153
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,280
Whitney, why would you put
 superglue in my mascara?

1154
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,130
I didn't.

1155
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,600
She wouldn't put
 superglue in your mascara.

1156
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,650
But if I did, maybe it
 was to get back at you

1157
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,750
for stealing my
 synergy wave pendant.

1158
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,940
But I didn't put
 superglue in, what is it?

1159
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,550
Listen, we gave you Ula.

1160
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:24,270
That's enough.

1161
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,380
Well maybe you put superglue
 in your own mascara.

1162
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,580
Get the on set medic.

1163
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,590
It's burning, it's burning.

1164
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:31,590
It's OK.

1165
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:32,770
We're going to the
 emergency room.

1166
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,550
Come on.

1167
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:34,580
I'm extremely disappointed.

1168
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,630
And I don't mind telling you.
 -Really?

1169
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,680
I thought it worked great.

1170
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,290
Anyway, back to the scene.

1171
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:42,090
Did you--

1172
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:45,930
The whole pie-- listen-- the
 pie, the pie, the pie baking

1173
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:49,010
thing with the, with the--

NARRATOR: In the 1980's, no porn
 director enjoyed more success

1175
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,550
than Mac Hollister.

1176
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,590
He was the industry's golden
 boy, the Spielberg of smut.

1177
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,210
The Lucas of the lube.

1178
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:02,330
But then he made a
 crucial error in judgment.

1179
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:05,460
In 1988 Hollister
 directed Fondling Fathers,

1180
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,860
a 12 hour gay porn set at the
 Constitutional Convention.

1181
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,330
And outside of a few
 pleasantly surprised

1182
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:14,950
constitutional scholars and
 a closet Federalist, no one

1183
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:15,920
went to see it.

1184
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,720
Fondling Fathers
 collapsed like no movie

1185
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,460
has ever collapsed, OK?

1186
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,200
It cost $500,000 and
 grossed a buck and a half.

1187
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,870
And he went into a
 major depression, OK?

1188
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,690
He did not pass go.

1189
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,080
He did not collect $200.

1190
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,950
He went home and
 he started eating.

1191
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:33,680
After a month he
 gained 10 pounds.

1192
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,380
After a year he was
 up to 563 pounds.

1193
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,410
I mean, who's going
 to hire the guy?

1194
00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:40,860
I don't know what he's
 been doing for work.

1195
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:41,960
Action.

1196
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,900
No one on the Hillside Heaters
 could believe their eyes.

1197
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,780
Spencer, a right handed hitter
 who wore the number six,

1198
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,530
was paralyzed from
 the waist down.

1199
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:53,800
But as he rolled his wheelchair
 into the batter's box--

1200
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,500
Cut!

1201
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,630
That's the worst
 reading I've ever heard.

1202
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:58,150
What the fuck was that?

1203

[CAR ENGINE]

1204
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:11,440
He says he's been directing
 commercials and Europe

1205
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,380
for the last 10 years?

1206
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,920
Yeah, he's been in his mom's
 garage for the last 10 years,

1207
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,620
on an allowance.

1208
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,950
Who the fuck is that?

1209
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:20,530
It's just me, mom.

1210
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:22,270
Where the fuck you been?

1211
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:24,450
I've been working
 mom, go back to bed.

1212
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,730
You get my fucking box out?

1213
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:29,160
I mean, I feel for him.

1214
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,960
You can take a
 guy like that, try

1215
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,770
to marshall that kind of cast,
 with that kind of baggage,

1216
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,640
he doesn't stand a chance.

1217

[MUSIC PLAYING]

1218
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,280
Mo never had
 conflicts on his sets.

1219
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,150
He didn't believe in that.

1220
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:53,200
I mean, Mo's philosophy was, it
 takes a village to make a porn.

1221
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,560
He had people in
 the Love Shack who

1222
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:00,330
had great big hearts, who had
 immense amounts of tolerance.

1223
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,310
And that collaboration worked.

1224
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:05,400
Every important
 innovation in pornography,

1225
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,480
with the exception of the
 delivery boy and the face shot,

1226
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,170
came from Mo Saltzman.

1227
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:11,670
NARRATOR: In the
 late '60s, Mo merged

1228
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:15,350
pornography and poetry
 into an experimental genre

1229
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,580
called pornetry.

1230
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:23,270
I am fear.

1231
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:25,790
I am unwell.

1232
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:26,520
I'm a roasted peanut.

1233
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,060
I am my own orgasm.

1234
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,220
NARRATOR: And in
 1979 he produced

1235
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,710
Phallus in Wonderland,
 the world's first computer

1236
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:37,130
generated porntoon.

1237
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:37,870
What's my name?

1238
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:38,740
Steve.

1239
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,800
Say my name, bitch.

1240
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,700
Steve.

1241
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,910
Louder.

1242
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,030
Steve.

1243
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:45,880
33.

1244
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,470
Didn't we shoot 33 last night?

1245
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:50,340
Oh, yeah, 90% of it.

1246
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,350
There are just a couple hiccups.
 -OK.

1247
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:53,260
Yeah.

1248
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:56,070
And what about 45?

1249
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,690
Pick ups, a couple inserts.

1250
00:48:58,690 --> 00:48:59,470
And 50?

1251
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,280
Inserts.

1252
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,250
Mac, I've got to be honest.

1253
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:03,580
The rest of the sheet
 looks like a xerox

1254
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,510
of yesterday's call sheet.

1255
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:05,860
We didn't get
 everything yesterday.

1256
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,220
We got 90% of it.
 All the exposition and dialogue.

1257
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,200
Well what did we not get?

1258
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,060
Maybe we don't need it.
 -Everything.

1259
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,750
Great.
 Then what are we missing?

1260
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,330
The sex.

1261
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,340
The sex?

1262
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,630
Yeah, just a little of the sex.

1263
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,340
What the fuck are people
 going to be watching?

1264
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,490
People are not coming to a
 porno for its snappy dialogue.

1265
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:22,190
Yeah, no.

1266
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:23,750
That's why Meryl
 Streep doesn't do porno.

1267
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,250
We've got the best
 of the best coming up.

1268
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,710
Whitney and Hallie,
 Spinchter Brothers.

1269
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,730
-Yeah?
 -Jake Storm.

1270
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,220
Are they going to fuck?
 Or are they just going to talk?

1271
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:30,350
Yeah, yeah they're
 going to fuck.

1272
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:32,330
Not fucking talking, fucking.

1273
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:35,910
You're going to hear, you're
 practically going to smell it.

1274
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:36,740
Who's your guy.

1275
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,270
-You're my guy.
 -I'm your guy.

1276
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,820
You guy's not going
 to let you down.

1277
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:42,460
It would be so sad if something
 happened to my guy, right?

1278
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:43,850
Yeah.
 Nothing's going to happen.

1279
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:47,440
-Be my guy.
 -I'm your guy.

1280
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,510
Yeah.

1281
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:51,190
And action.

Ladies it's official.

1283
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,280
Secretary Blomquist
 is officially dead.

1284
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,590
No, not dead.

1285
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,540
Hands down the biggest
 asshole I ever met?

1286
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,570
Jake Storm, OK?

1287
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:04,350
Asshole.

1288
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:09,050
A lot of different porn stars
 are-- they're more oh, or uh,

1289
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:10,960
or darling, it's all about you.

1290
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,270
I'm not like that.

1291
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:13,060
I'm more like huh?
 Yeah?

1292
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,170
You want some?
 Because I've got more.

1293
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:17,670
Are you sure?

1294
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:19,980
I was with him for 90 minutes.

1295
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,740
Did you check your stethoscope?

1296
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:22,720
I did.
 Twice.

1297
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:23,650
You know, it's funny.

1298
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:26,780
They say that the best
 way to get over tragedy

1299
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,160
is to do something
 that makes you happy.

1300
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,520
Oh, I know.

1301
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,820
Let's do something
 that you're in love

1302
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,380
with, something that you want
 to spend the rest of your life

1303
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,240
with.

1304
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,110
Something that you don't--

1305
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,670
What the fuck is
 wrong with you?

1306
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,070
Hey, hey, hey.

Do you know what type of
 underwear your mother wore?

She always wore one size
 above what she needed,

1318
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,720
just to have that little extra.

We've got a lot of the
 dialogue still to shoot.

1341
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,710
You've been coming
 home every night

 everything's great.

Look, I wanted to spare you,
 because I know how emotional--

00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,630
You've got beautiful
 women, you've got guys

1348
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:35,870
who've been doing this forever.

1349

 let them bump vaginas

You are not my fucking guy.

You are not my fucking guy.

1355
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,120
When you're cutting
 a film like this,

1356
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,030
it's like you go to one of
 those all you can eat buffets.

1357
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:51,370
Way to go, Mitch.

1358
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:55,390
And as the editor, you pick
 and choose what looks good.

1359
00:52:55,390 --> 00:53:00,880
And you put it together into
 a potentially beautiful meal.

1360
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,910
And all we've got now is
 like a side of coleslaw.

1361
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,250
You know what?

1362
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,710
We had a rough couple of days.

1363
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,620
So I decided to shake
 things up a little bit.

1364
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:18,230
I called our leads, told
 them to take the morning off,

1365
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,780
and get your shit together.

1366
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:23,030
I'm really glad our scene
 got pushed back, because I'm

1367
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:24,620
still in a lot of pain.

1368
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,620
And my depth
 perception's way off.

1369
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:32,360
So it's really hard to get
 around set and everything.

1370
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,950
Well it took a
 little finessing,

1371
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:35,770
but I moved some things around.

1372
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:40,140
I scheduled a scene with
 Furious George and Carl Munson,

1373
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,270
masters of sado-hygienic cinema.

1374
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:46,060
-I feel waxy.
 -Take it.

1375
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,470
I'm still dirty.

1376
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,050
What do you have?

1377
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:51,020
Gingivitis.

1378
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,730
I can't hear you.

1379
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,400
Gingivitis!

1380
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,580
These guys are total pros.

1381
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,560
We can't mess with these.

1382
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,770
We'll get a couple easy
 scenes under our belt,

1383
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,090
we'll be back in business.

1384
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:05,660
And action.

1385
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:10,300
Did you, or did you not
 bake the lingonberry pie?

1386
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,110
No.

1387
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,950
Liar.

1388
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,500
Did you, or did you not know
 that the Secretary Blomquist

1389
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,750
was allergic to lingonberries.

1390
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,650
-I didn't know.
 -Liar.

1391
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,840
You're a very weak
 little man, are you not?

1392
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,100
Say it.

I'm a weak little man.

1394
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,860
I'm a mouse.

1395
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,460
I'm a mouse.

1396
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,150
Liar!

1397
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,950
I'm sorry, that's not any good.

1398
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:44,080
This fucking sucks.

1399
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:44,900
We're still rolling.

1400
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:45,790
All right, we're going.

1401
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:47,510
From the top.

1402
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:49,590
Jesus, right?

1403
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,990
Liar!

1404
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:51,930
Like that?

1405
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,930
I spoke with one of my
 guys down at the Center

1406
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,510
for Advanced Menopausal studies,
 and here's what he says we can

1407
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:03,120
expect out of Furious Georgia.

1408
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,130
Mood swings,
 irritability, fatigue,

1409
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:12,040
memory loss, depression, hot
 flashes, decreased libido, OK?

1410
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,600
Vaginal dryness,
 and incontinence.

1411
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,780
Now if that doesn't say porn
 star, I don't know what does.

1412
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:25,810
Did you, or did you not,
 bake the lingonberry pie

1413
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,480
that killed the
 Secretary Blomquist?

1414
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:30,610
I did not.

1415
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:33,350
Liar.

1416
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,930
You're almost making me feel
 as badly about myself as you do.

1417
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:41,630
Fuck me.

1418
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,520
I can't do it.

1419
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,180
I mean I'm fucking menopausal.

1420
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,750
I didn't have to do this
 when I was menopausal.

1421
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,240
Do you need some sugar?
 Do you need a diaper?

1422
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,660
I don't need sugar
 Hollister, I need hormones.

1423
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:52,880
It was pretty bad.

1424
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,590
We saw one of the great
 ones go down today.

1425
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:56,280
You know, really.

1426
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,390
Truly one of the great ones.

1427
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,370
It rocks me.

1428
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:00,760
It shakes me.

00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,510
This is the moment I've been
 waiting for for eight years.

1440
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:56,910
Yeah.
 Right.

1441
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:58,550
All right.
 I'll see you out there.

1442
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:02,340
It's finally here, me and
 Marty back in the saddle.

It's beautiful.

 want to take positions?

-Yeah, we do.
 -Marty, in the middle please.

00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,770
Yeah, OK Marty, you take
 your spot in the middle.

 over his right shoulder.

 OK.

 And action.

You!

1453
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,970
You slept with Senator
 Blomquist in the study.

1454
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:24,950
How could you do that to me?

1455
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:26,300
Niels, you need to get over it.

1456
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:30,050
Because you need-- we need
 to focus on getting an alibi.

Regita's right.

1460
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,070
Constable Bjornson's
 forces are coming

1461
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:39,850
at us from the north wing.

1462
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,280
The Swedish National Guard?

1463
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,230
They're coming at
 us from the south.

1464
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,940
It's only a matter of time
 before the tips of those two

1465
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,610
forces touch, and--

1466
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:49,080
All right, hold it.
 Hold it.

1467
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,060
Keep rolling, keep rolling.

1468
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,660
The slow thing's not
 really working for me.

1469
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:55,020
Establish the forces,
 the forces, boom!

1470
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:56,600
And the pounding action.

1471
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,990
They pound down, pounding.

1472
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:59,340
Pound, pound,
 pound, pound, pound.

1473
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,970
It's the violence of the
 smashing of the tips.

1474
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:04,800
We want to see the jackhammer.

1475
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,460
The tension comes
 from the violence.

00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,060
-Collide.
 -Collide, collide!

1477
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:07,760
Yeah.

1478
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,410
But the tips have to--

1479
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:11,540
Smash.

1480
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:14,080
Pound, pound, pound, pound.

00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,540
Oh dear God.

00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,520
Yes, yes, the jackhammer.

00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,640
Marty, Marty wait a minute.

1484
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,660
We're just working the
 scene here a little bit.

1485
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,960
Marty?

1486
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,030
Get the fuck in here.

1487
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:28,050
-What was that out there?
 -What?

1488
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:28,910
We're shooting a scene.

1489
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:30,770
Sometimes things
 get a little hairy.

1490
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:31,520
A little hairy?

1491
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,620
That was like chaos out there.
 -Well--

1492
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:36,120
The deadline for the
 Peevies is in two days.

1493
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,150
That's the whole point of this.

1494
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,760
I can shoot this in one day.
 We got two days?

1495
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,030
Great.
 No problem.

1496
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:41,800
Listen, you don't understand
 how desperate I am, OK?

1497
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,400
Listen.
 -Look, no--

1498
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,010
I'm playing with
 Ted's money here.

1499
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:47,190
And if Ted's money goes away,
 Ted's going to get bitchy.

1500
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,320
And if Ted gets bitchy,
 then I get bitchy.

1501
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,540
And if I get bitchy,
 trouble ensues.

1502
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:54,250
You get me?

1503
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:55,160
I get you, I get you.

1504
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,660
I'll get it, I'll get it Andre.

1505
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,570
You better get it.

1506
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:58,300
Because you know what?

1507
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,190
If I wanted to get fucked
 in the ass, I'd go home.

1508
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:05,660
Well I had a really productive
 meeting with Andre last night.

1509
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:08,850
We addressed some concerns
 that we were both having.

1510
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:10,960
And I've made some calls,
 I've taken some measures.

1511
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,850
Everything's going to be,
 you know, right on track.

1512
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,810
Huh.
 Yeah, that's really good.

1513
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,920
Essentially I'm a diva doctor.

1514
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,680
I am brought in to sets
 to different locations

1515
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,380
all around the world.

1516
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,710
And I help everybody
 solve problems.

1517
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:28,020
So when I leave, people
 can skip hand-in-hand.

1518
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,260
Do you remember when you used
 to fight in grade school,

1519
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,230
and the teacher would make you
 hold hands with your friend,

1520
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:34,000
and say, sing the
 friendship song?

1521
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,180
(SINGING) Make new
 friends, but keep the old,

1522
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:41,080
one is silver and
 the other's gold.

1523
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,970
I can't hit the high note, but
 I think you know what I mean.

1524
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:46,350
That's kind of what I do.

1525
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:47,610
I don't do the song.

1526
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:49,900
But the song's really in here.

1527
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:50,920
Hey everybody.

1528
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,990
My name's Kat Waters.

1529
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,470
I'm thrilled to be here.

1530
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:54,990
I was called upon
 by your director

1531
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:57,390
to be an on set negotiator.

1532
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:58,840
Let's clear the air here.

1533
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,090
I'm going to start a phrase,
 and you're going to complete it.

1534
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:03,650
I feel things went wrong when--

1535
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:08,030
I feel things went wrong
 when Hallie showed up.

1536
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,100
We're not going to
 point fingers yet, OK?

1537
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,180
Because when you
 point one finger,

1538
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,620
there's three
 pointing back at you,

1539
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,030
and a big old thumb
 that's probably

1540
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:18,060
been in someone's tush,
 pointing right back at you.

1541
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:23,010
I felt things went wrong when
 I can't open my eye right now.

1542
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:25,660
We're going to do a little
 thing called leaving the crying

1543
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,010
to the audition room.

1544
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:28,510
You know we're all adults here.

1545
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:31,210
And we just need to talk,
 because little babies cry.

1546
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:33,970
Oh, oh point Kat Water.

1547
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:35,850
We really need
 to be adults here.

1548
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:36,550
She's good.

1549
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,250
She's very good.

1550
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:39,480
Kat Waters?

1551
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,240
I saw myself in her.

1552
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,540
And I saw herself on me.
 You know?

1553
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:47,190
I just saw the two of
 us connecting, you know?

1554
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:51,130
Like two women who know
 exactly what they want.

1555
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:51,930
You know?

1556
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:54,650
Who know how to go at
 it and get it done.

1557
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:55,510
That's right.

1558
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:58,590
Woman to woman, mano a
 mano, womano a womano.

1559
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:02,210
Mano a mano, oh
 ponytail lady in a suit.

1560
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:03,730
I like your style.

1561
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:04,580
I love it.

1562
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:05,980
Cheers to a working
 lady with a ponytail.

1563
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:06,960
Right on.

1564
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,920
I'm done.

1565
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,670
That's my water.

1566
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:10,370
That's my water.

1567
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:11,650
OK.

1568
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:11,840
Gretchen, you want to go ahead
 and start with your demands?

1569
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,180
Yeah, I do.
 OK.

1570
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,140
The specific demands
 that we are making

1571
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:18,320
all pertain to a health
 issue, and a safety

1572
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,830
issue on behalf of my client.

1573
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:22,960
She is allergic to glitter,
 peroxide, the lipstick

1574
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,930
that she uses, pigtails,
 unwashed pubic hair,

1575
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:27,140
and baby powder.

1576
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,640
Not to mention the
 fact that Halle

1577
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,440
has one nipple the
 size of a yarmulke,

1578
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,950
the other one is an acorn cap.

1579
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,280
That's just disorienting.

1580
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,160
We can't work with that.

1581
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,430
That is outrageous.

1582
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:37,700
I will not do with
 that kind of attitude.

1583
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,040
Excuse me.

1584
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,290
These are her demands.

1585
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:43,420
You're not effective
 when you yell, dad.

1586
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:50,510
I'm not comfortable with
 the unwashed pubic hair.

1587
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:56,100
We wash every single pubic
 hair singularly, every day.

1588
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:56,800
OK.

1589
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,140
I've heard this
 happening before.

1590
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,420
When girls have that
 weird unwashed smell,

1591
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,180
it's actually an
 excess of melon.

1592
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:05,020
So if you could stop
 with your honeydew honey,

1593
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,210
I think things will be smelling
 pretty nice down south.

1594
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:08,390
Oh she is good.

1595
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:09,550
She is good.

1596
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:10,530
So we're OK with that?

1597
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:11,950
-I won't eat melon.
 -OK.

1598
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:12,650
She won't eat melon.

1599
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:15,820
As far as the nipples go,
 could we fill in the small one

1600
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:18,340
with a rouge or a blush?
 -Something.

1601
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:20,400
Something that won't come off
 in a hand once it's pinched.

1602
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,330
Because I see it, and
 then I'm like, where I am?

1603
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:23,870
I can't have that.
 She could fall.

1604
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:24,910
I could fall over.

1605
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:28,200
You're sensing that her nipples
 are like the size of an acorn,

1606
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,700
but you want more
 of a bagel bite?

1607
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,400
Yes.

1608
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,360
I think we can work
 this out in make up.

1609
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,770
Are you all right with
 having a little rouge, maybe

1610
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:37,660
a little lip liner, something
 to spread out our areola more

1611
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,800
like a little pizza.

1612
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:39,500
Is that OK?

1613
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,200
Yes.

1614
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:41,140
OK.

1615
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:42,860
I'm hearing that
 we've kind of wrapped

1616
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,050
this up pretty beautifully.

1617
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:48,020
I mean, I think we can
 put a kiss on this stamp

1618
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:50,150
and put it in the mail.

1619
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:52,090
Can we put this
 letter in the mail?

1620
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:54,740
Send it to me.

1621
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,420
Everybody thinks I'm having
 some emotional reaction

1622
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:58,910
to something.
 I'm fine.

1623
01:02:58,910 --> 01:02:59,720
It's this production.

1624
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,620
I mean, this thing
 is not a tight ship.

1625
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,650
It's being run like a
 freaking high school

1626
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,170
production of Pippen.

1627
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:05,870
Excuse me.

1628
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:08,190
Oh, hey Marty, can I
 borrow you for a minute?

1629
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,410
Yeah, sure.

1630
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,380
Cool, thanks.

1631
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:13,980
It's probably another
 wardrobe fitting.

1632
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:14,680
Yeah?

1633
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,060
Come on in, Marty.

1634
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:23,380
My wardrobe's fine.

1635
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,350
Hey Marty.

1636
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:27,160
Hey.

1637
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,950
We love you, you
 know that, right?

1638
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:30,470
Sure.

1639
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:33,480
I have a fondness for you.

1640
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:34,330
What's up?

1641
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:36,220
We care about you.

1642
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:37,840
And we feel that
 you have a problem

1643
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,240
that we need to discuss.

1644
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,300
What are you talking about?

1645
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:42,580
Jerry, what's he talking about?

1646
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:45,730
This is an intervention.

1647
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:47,740
You're having an-- you're
 having an intervention.

1648
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:48,880
Why Jerry?

1649
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,390
Why are we having an
 intervention today?

1650
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:53,350
Marty, I'm your brother.

1651
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:55,260
I love you.

1652
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:59,840
Eight years ago, Rock
 and a Hard Place.

1653
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,390
LaCienaga was there, Hollister.

1654
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:05,620
We were doing a scene.

1655
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:09,590
Something went wrong,
 terribly wrong.

1656
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:12,080
What are you talking about?

1657
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:14,160
You guys touched weiners.

1658
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:14,940
I got it.

1659
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:16,210
Marty, we touched tips.

1660
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:17,810
Let's face it.

1661
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,060
We touched tips.

1662
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:22,780
How-- how do you know-- how
 do you know we touched tips?

1663
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:23,970
I heard it.

1664
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:24,790
You heard it?

1665
01:04:24,790 --> 01:04:25,760
I heard it.

1666
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:26,470
I don't know.

1667
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:27,930
I have no idea what
 you're talking about.

1668
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,100
You can't run from it, Marty.

1669
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,960
Believe me, everyone knows.

1670
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,040
It's on the internet.

1671
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,790
Not helpful.

1672
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:34,660
All right.

1673
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,470
All right, fine.

1674
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:38,540
So what?
 So what?

1675
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,210
So what if we did touch tips?
 So what?

1676
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,010
What's the big deal?

1677
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:42,220
That has to mean something?

1678
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:43,320
I lost my brother over it.

1679
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,330
Well it's not my fault
 that your life is shit,

1680
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:46,730
and mine is fantastic.

1681
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:47,630
It's not your fault.

1682
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:49,200
It's not my fault
 that you're playing

1683
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:52,150
the banjo on Venice
 Boulevard, and I'm making

1684
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:53,690
multimillion dollar deals.

1685
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:54,390
It's not your fault.

1686
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,130
It's not my fault.

1687
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:56,240
Well it's partially his fault.

1688
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,630
It's not his fault.

1689
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:58,940
It's not my fault.

1690
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:00,780
There were two
 penises there that day.

1691
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,840
It's not my fault that we
 don't play catch anymore.

1692
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,440
It's not my fault.
 I'm not responsible

1693
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,010
for this relationship anymore.

1694
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:07,450
It's not my fault.

1695
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:08,850
Talk to me.

1696
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:12,230
It's not my fault.
 It's not my fault.

1697
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:13,970
It's not your fault.

1698
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:15,580
It's not my fault
 that we touched tips.

1699
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,510
We touched tips.

1700
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:19,930
We did it.

1701
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:23,320
We touched tips.

1702
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,320
We touched tips.

1703
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,660
And we enjoyed it.

1704
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,850
OK, well.

1705
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:29,360
What?

1706
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,060
We enjoyed it.

1707
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:32,510
I didn't enjoy it.

1708
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:33,490
That's disgusting.

1709
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:34,610
Marty.

1710
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:36,420
Stay in the room, Marty.

1711
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:39,420
Marty.

1712
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:41,220
Did you really enjoy it?

1713
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,240
Wow.

1714
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,760
They enjoyed it.

1715
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,440
That's a little creepy,
 don't you think?

1716
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:52,210
Well, those Jews.

1717
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:53,840
Why am I in charge of the keys?

1718
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,870
It doesn't seem like I would be
 the guy who would be selected

1719
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,070
to be in charge of the keys.

1720
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:57,940
Because you were driving.

1721
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:59,920
Were you in this room?
 -I don't know.

1722
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,330
I just really want
 to get out of here.

1723
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:02,470
Where did you leave them?

1724
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:04,670
I handed them to you.
 -I know.

1725
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:05,490
You gave them to me.

1726
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:06,860
I had them in my hand.

1727
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:09,310
And then I-- I
 remember I put them--

1728
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:10,420
Put them where?

1729
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,400
I don't think
 they're in this room.

1730
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,100
I don't feel--
 -Feel?

1731
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,190
Have you looked?

1732
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:16,060
No, I don't have to look.

1733
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:16,920
I just feel them.

1734
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:17,820
See if they're in the room.

1735
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:18,810
So let's just--

1736
01:06:18,810 --> 01:06:19,900
Do you remember this room?

1737
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,340
---get another way home.
 No.

1738
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:22,040
I don't.

1739
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,740
It smells like Chinese food.

1740
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,010
This was the room
 we shot Deep Dish.

1741
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:27,020

Do you remember this?

1749
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:44,530
You know, I have to get
 back for water practice.

1750
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:50,740
But I could spare a few minutes.
 -Nice.

1751
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:58,980
You were the one that wanted
 the sausage and pepperoni.

You totally calmed me down.

1766
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,370
Because I was so nervous.

1767
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:36,380
And I was completely
 broken out in hives.

1777
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:05,130
Should we try to find the keys?

1778
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:07,350
I know where the keys are.

1779
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:09,290

 -We don't need her.

We can work with just Whitney.

1915

She's sweaty.

1924
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:08,620
It's not the end
 of the world for me.

1925
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:11,150
But it was a-- it would have
 been nice for these folks

1926
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:16,090
to have one last go around.

1927
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:17,520
I thought this would
 be a great opportunity

1928
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,670
to see the old gang, and
 to pay tribute to Mo.

1929
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:21,630
We came close.

1930
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:22,890
I think we came close.

1931
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:23,650
We were almost there.

1932
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:26,000
I don't know, maybe Mo
 could have pulled it off.

1933
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,840
It didn't work out the
 way we thought it would.

1934
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,180
It didn't come
 together, you know?

1935
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:34,060
But a work of art
 is never finished.

1936
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:35,080
You are so full of shit.

1937
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:36,090
That's two.

1938
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:37,810
That's stage two.

1939
01:13:37,810 --> 01:13:38,610
He's working through it.

1940
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:39,860
You're pathetic.

1941
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:42,200
I thought this would be good
 to kind of rekindle things,

1942
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,670
re-- see each other
 in a different light.

1943
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:48,780
But I guess only
 I saw it that way.

1944
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:54,540
I can't believe they
 let it come to this.

1945
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:55,880
It's so stupid.

1946
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:59,120
I mean, the worst part is,
 if you needed an actor,

1947
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,600
why didn't you just use me?

1948
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,690
I'm right here, dammit.

01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:08,410
Are you blind?

01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,780
You're an idiot.

01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,080

That's four.

01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:17,390
I know it's painful.

01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:18,090
Is it?

01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:25,630
I wanted this experience
 to be something beautiful.

1962
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:28,190
I wanted it to be
 two women, you know,

1963
01:14:28,190 --> 01:14:31,460
having that lesbian experience.

1964
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,400

 going to work.

You know who else doesn't work?

My maid.

She is so fucking lazy.

I'll take a week in

 and get back to it.

 a very powerful thing.

01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:04,170
It transcends time.

01:15:04,170 --> 01:15:07,230
You can always find love again.

It makes, you know,
 the old young again,

and the young wise.

1979
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:14,860
I think people go
 away from love,

1980
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:16,920
and then they come
 back to love, you know?

1981

And that's where
 they're the happiest,

I've never even been to Europe.

Ever since Fondling

living in my mother's garage.

And I've been directing
 books on tape.

But the biggest lie is that
 there isn't a steamer trunk.

01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:24,390
Mo didn't leave a script,
 or a cast list, or anything.

I just wanted to
 make another movie.

 it felt like family again.

 feeling in the world.

But even though it didn't win
 an award or get any recognition,

01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,120
Yeah.
 You want to write on the balls?

2094
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:43,990
I feel like I've been
 blessed this past year.

2095
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:47,830
The film we're working on
 next is titled Special Ned.

2096
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:51,570
And it's about a mentally
 handicapped high school

2097
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:54,720
student who vows to
 lose his virginity

2098
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,220
before the end of the summer.

2099
01:22:56,220 --> 01:23:00,130
And as you know, handicapped
 kids have a hard time

2100
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:02,410
getting laid in real life.

2101
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:06,330
Through this film we hope to
 inspire other handicapped kids

2102
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:08,620
to go out there and try it.

2103
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:12,620
Safe, not rape.

2104
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:13,730
Whose idea was that?

2105
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:14,870
That's gross.

2106
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:17,060
Not to get retarded
 kids out raping people,

2107
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:21,330
but to inspire them
 to live normal lives.

2108
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:23,630
What the fuck is this?

2109
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:26,000
But no one benefited
 more from the experience

2110
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,620
than Kat Waters
 and Gretchen Becky.

2111
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,360
A week after the
 film wrapped, they

2112
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,350
were married at the Love Shack.

2113
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:33,210
-I just came.
 -Too loud.

2114
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:34,400
-Hi.
 -Too loud.

2115
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:35,090
Hey, too loud.

2116
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,190
We don't actually do
 the Ferber method.

2117
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:44,340
We don't them-- we don't
 let her cry it out.

2118
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:47,350
But what we do is, it's
 a shrieking technique.

2119
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:48,790
Watch this.

2120
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:49,750
[SHRIEKING]

2121
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:55,040
Calms them right down.

2122
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:56,650
I don't think that
 you can't overstate

2123
01:23:56,650 --> 01:24:00,290
the importance of the Sphincter
 Brother's reconciliation.

2124
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:03,800
But sadly, the story
 doesn't end there.

2125
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:07,080
During the Dial M orgy,
 Jerry accidentally entered

2126
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,790
Marty's anus for eight seconds.

2127
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:11,290
Oh, whoa whoa.

2128
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:16,290
How would I like
 to be remembered?

2129
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:20,090
I think I've created a
 lot of love, you know?

2130
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:23,010
Through the relationships
 I've created, you know?

2131
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:25,290
I've brought some
 fantastic people

2132
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:28,200
together who have
 fallen in love,

2133
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,770
and created love, and made love.

2134
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:32,030
And they spread their love.

2135
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:37,050
To be the acorn of so much love
 is such a wonderful legacy.

2136
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:40,500
And I think that's a beautiful
 way to be remembered,

2137
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:45,780
as the acorn of love.

2138
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:46,670
Or with a plaque.

2139
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:49,920
