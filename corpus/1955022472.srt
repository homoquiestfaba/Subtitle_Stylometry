172
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,893
How you doin'?
Just fine.

173
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,028
Lavetta, where Dre and Jinx at?
They in the back.

174
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,030
<i>¶¶ Excuse me.</i>

175
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,567
Come on, baby. Chill out.
Take your nap. Hey, little mama.

176
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:52,303
Why you didn't say hi?

177
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:00,378
What up, Cube?
What up?

178
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,283
Ooh.

179
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,785
Whoo!

180
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,888
<i>¶ It's time ¶</i>

181
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,756
Scratch that shit!

182
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,958
Damn, Dre!

183
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,629
<i>¶ It's time ¶
Whoo!</i>

184
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,497
<i>¶ It's time ¶
Damn!</i>

185
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:23,668
<i>¶ It's ti-- It's ti--
It's-- It's-- It's-- ¶</i>

186
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,937
<i>¶ It's time ¶
Whoo! Yeah!</i>

187
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,944
<i>Whoo!</i>

188
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,479
- Fuck that shit up, Dre!
- Yo.

189
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,015
That shit was dope, homey!
What's up, Cube?

190
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:40,185
Man! Had some crazy shit
happen on the bus today.

191
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:43,621
I had a Crenshaw Mafia O.G.
get on the bus,

192
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,523
pulled a gun out on us,

193
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,193
gave a fucking motivational
speech and then bumped out.

194
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:49,794
Shit was crazy.

195
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,300
You must be
stayin' a while.

196
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:57,969
Yup. Mama kicked him out
'cause of that mouth.

197
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,971
Shut your ass up.

198
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:02,106
She didn't kick me out.
I left.

199
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:04,976
Whatever.
That's what they all say, homey.

200
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:06,778
You got them rhymes?

201
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:10,215
Man, I stay
with the rhymes.

202
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:12,784
Man, I'm talkin' about
that hard shit.

203
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,220
All I write
is that hard shit, Dre.

204
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:18,056
So what's up, man?
You ready for Doo-To's?

205
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,225
Is Doo-To's ready for me?
You know that's Compton, right?

206
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,961
They got body bags
at the door.

207
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,864
Okay.

208
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,365
Your ass
better bring it,

209
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,868
'cause if you don't,
you might end up in one for real.

210
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,570
Body bag?
Man, I don't know about that shit.

211
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,540
Ain't nobody fucking with you, Jinx.

212
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,476
You can tell your moms
to fix this fucking AC.

213
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:42,313
Man, what are you doing here, homeless?

214
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,916
Get off of me, nigga!

215
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,719
Well, fuck you!
Fuck you!

216
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,022
Get the fuck off me!

217
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:54,559
Shit! The fuck you holdin' me for?
Get the fuck off me!

218
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,261
Where the fuck you going?

219
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,763
Hey, man, I'm just trying to get home, man.
I'm not even doin' nothin'.

220
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,866
Put your fucking hands on top of your head.
Interlace your fingers.

221
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:03,268
Spread your fucking legs.

222
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,604
Stay the fuck down.
Man, this hood is fuckin' hot!

223
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:09,574
Shut the fuck up!
What the hell is going on out here?

224
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,077
Look, these boys, they all grew up on this block.
Okay? Get back in the house.

225
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,179
That's my son.
O'Shea!

226
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,515
That's my son.
Lady, I'm telling you.

227
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:21,786
Get back inside, or I promise you,
I will ruin your fuckin' night!

228
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:25,623
- Man, you ain't got to talk to my moms like that.
- Shut the fuck up!

229
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,892
- Motherfuckin' nigger.
- Oh, I'm a nigger now?

230
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,628
Wait a minute, my ass,
motherfucker.

231
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,965
- Okay.
- Officer, can you explain why you jackin' us right now?

232
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,967
Man, I ain't
explaining shit to you.

233
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,303
Get the fuck up off the street.
I'm on my property.

234
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:40,872
I can stand right here.
You got that?

235
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,241
Son!
We right here!

236
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,410
Where you got the fuckin' rocks, homeboy?

237
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:48,046
- Not everybody slangin' dope, man.
- I don't give a fuck!

238
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:51,115
This is LAPD.
I'm the only gangster out here.

239
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:55,153
All right. They all check out. Check what?
Y'all are just over here fuckin' with us.

240
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,822
- Get up.
- We got cards on all of 'em anyway.

241
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:01,626
Pick your shit up.
Stay out of trouble, man.

242
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,162
Okay, let's go.
Head home.

243
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:07,332
Stay back.
Ain't doin' shit, man!

244
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,834
Get the fuck outta here.

245
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:12,303
Hey, man--
Take a fuckin' walk.

246
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,239
Hey.

247
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,908
O'Shea!

248
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,083
Get the fuck outta here!
Bullshit!

249
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,095
You really
want to be here?

250
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,331
This club
full of Pirus.

251
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,000
We straight.

252
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,669
Yeah, thanks for the tip, homey.

253
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,039
Jesus.

254
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,851
I look in your eyes
and I see a Capricorn.

255
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,686
You're a Capricorn, right?

256
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:06,958
I mean, I can look at a girl
and I know their sign. You know?

257
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,527
It's just something I do.
Oh. Mm-hmm.

258
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:14,132
Look, I hope I'm not disrespecting you, right?
Uh-uh. Not at all.

259
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,467
Good.
Good. Yella!

260
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,102
Lonzo coming, man.

261
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,079
No, no.
"Weak at the Knees." Huh?

262
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,680
"Weak at the Knees."
Oh.

263
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:33,084
Hey. I'm gonna go outside,
make sure nothing's poppin' off.

264
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:35,586
I want you to keep
these fat asses shakin'.

265
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,655
Don't play none of that
street-ass rap shit.

266
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:41,325
I want these motherfuckers thinkin' about pussy,
not pistols.

267
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,928
Yella!
I saw you talking to my lady, man.

268
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,597
Keep your motherfuckin'
hands to yourself.

269
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,232
All right.

270
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,438
Man, why you always fuckin'
with Lonzo's girl, man?

271
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,273
Why not?

272
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,743
Can't be afraid of a grown man in high heels, Dre.

273
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,913
<i>Cube, you up.</i>

274
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:06,851
<i>Hey, yo, Compton! I got my little homey!</i>

275
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:09,454
He 'bout to come and bust
a little rhyme for y'all.

276
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:13,458
I want y'all to give it up
for Ice-motherfuckin'-Cube!

277
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,860
¶ Here's a little
somethin' 'bout a nigga like me ¶

278
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:18,796
¶ Never shoulda been

282
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,372
¶ Now I'm the muthafucka
that you read about ¶

283
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:30,775
¶ Takin' a life or two
That's what the hell I do ¶

284
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,111
¶ You don't like how I'm livin'?
Well, fuck you ¶

285
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,613
¶ This is a gang

¶ Ice Cube

291
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,494
¶ And then you realize

¶ Yo, what the fuck

301
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:20,424
Fucking right! I told you.
I told you. Yeah, you did. You did.

302
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:27,131
That's what I'm talking about, man.

303
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:30,134
Now, see, I'm this close
to firing your monkey ass.

304
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,703
What, you trying to
start a riot up in here?

305
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,640
Didn't I tell you I don't want that
hard-core shit played in my club?

306
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,309
As soon as I turn my back,
you do that shit anyway.

307
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:41,612
I'm just trying to help your business out, Lonzo.
They went crazy for that shit.

308
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,548
Don't worry about
my business, a'ight?

309
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:48,286
Just remember the only reason you up on that
stage is 'cause I put you up on that stage.

310
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,855
Now, you a badass DJ,
I'll give you that.

311
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,958
But you don't like to listen, Dre,
and I get tired of arguing all the time.

312
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,562
There's a lot of cats that'll come in here
and play exactly what I want 'em to play.

313
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,630
<i>¶¶ Like that shit right there.</i>

314
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,667
Cats that understand that you
don't bite the hand that feeds you.

315
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,136
Now, you take a backseat
to that shit, nigga.

316
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:06,704
These fuckin' marching jackets and shit.

317
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,874
Marching, my ass.
You march your ass and do what the fuck I say.

318
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,609
Hey, Dre.

319
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:15,580
Don't even trip
on him, homey.

320
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,882
Nigga ain't got
no fucking vision, man.

321
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:20,885
That's why I'm-a fuck his bitch right after he leaves.

322
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:24,222
<i>Not with that shit on.</i>

323
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,559
Hey!

324
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,495
Dr. Dre.
What's up, E?

325
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:33,331
It's been
a minute, man.

326
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,100
I love your jacket,
by the way.

327
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:37,501
You baggin' on me.

328
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,338
You know I don't like
wearing this shit.

329
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,274
That's Lonzo's shit, man.
You know it's part of the gig.

330
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,843
You remember the homey,
Ren from Kelly Park, right?

331
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,044
What's up?
What up, Dre?

332
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,779
What up?
What's up, man?

333
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:53,284
Look, I heard you been, um,
spending some time at your auntie house.

334
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,186
How's
the couch life?

335
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,757
It's fucked up.
I'm too tall for that shit.

336
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,727
Plus, I got my woman and baby living there.
It's hard, man.

337
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:05,129
But you know, everybody
can't do what you do.

338
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,298
But what I do gettin'
played out quick, man.

339
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,468
Motherfuckers is gettin' locked up
and laid down out here, you know?

340
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,237
- Gonna make some changes.
- Changes ain't bad.

341
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,973
Thinking about making
a few changes myself.

342
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,608
What you mean?

343
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,413
What you think about dumping
some money into this music shit?

344
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,315
Look, I got some ideas.

345
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:26,751
Let's give it up for Dr.
Dre!

346
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:29,787
- I gotta get back up there.
- That's your calling, man.

347
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,889
Tell Lonzo I said,
"Fuck him."

348
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:34,358
All right.
Hey, E.

349
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,094
Think about it.

350
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:38,729
All right.

351
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,434
What's up?
Do I know you? What?

352
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,935
Get 'em up.
Hell no!

353
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:48,172
Hey, don't be fuckin'
with my little brother, nigga!

354
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:51,676
What the fuck did he do?
Nigga lookin' at me like he know me or somethin'.

355
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:54,412
Man, I told you
about this shit!

356
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:57,081
Clear the parking lot.
I told you to go the fuck home.

357
00:21:57,083 --> 00:22:00,351
The fuck wrong with you, man?
You better chill the fuck out.

358
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:02,253
One time.

359
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,458
Hey! We told everybody
to clear this parking lot!

360
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,160
We just standing here.

361
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,594
Yeah, yeah.
Get outta here!

362
00:22:10,596 --> 00:22:12,963
What's going on? Hey!
Hey! Head home!

363
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,498
I fell.

364
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,767
You fell?
He fell?

365
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,537
That's what he said.

366
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:23,708
I didn't ask you what he said.
Get the fuck home!

367
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,111
<i>I am home.</i>

368
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:29,447
Head home! Go!

369
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,885
If you don't
start walking--

370
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,222
Or what?

371
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,791
Turn around.
Hands on your head.

372
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,293
Come on.
Fuck.

373
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:48,733
You have the right
to remain silent.

374
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:52,303
Stop resisting, boy!

375
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,973
Already know
what it is. Man.

376
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,409
Sucker-punched that dude, man.

377
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:00,578
Hey, man, nah, nah.
That was Tyree.

378
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,480
You know he got
that temper and shit.

379
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:06,484
Always getting me into fucking trouble, man.
What they lock you up for?

380
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:10,421
I was literally just standing there, man.
That's it.

381
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:12,490
As far
as they was concerned.

382
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:14,492
That's the gangsterist shit I heard all week.

383
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:17,061
Man, it's stupid.

384
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,030
Well, I was thinking about what you
was saying last night though, man.

385
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,899
Oh, yeah?

386
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,601
And?

387
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,404
It's interesting.
How long?

388
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,907
Really, like, how long do you think that
shit you doing out there gonna last?

389
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,943
'Cause it ain't no happy endings in that game, man.

390
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:36,714
You saying a lot for a nigga
who just got bailed outta jail.

391
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:39,116
I'm just saying,
if you can slang dope-- Nigga!

392
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:42,853
What, man?
Just tell the whole fuckin' world I sell dope.

393
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:46,557
Yo, yo. You can slang dope,
you can slang records, man. It's easy.

394
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,226
You got a mind
for that shit, E.

395
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:52,463
So what you talkin' about doing?
Li'l homey from last night? Nah, man.

396
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:55,533
He in a group.
You know, they a trip, but--

397
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,469
But that shit,
the reality raps,

398
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:00,738
that's what
I'm talking about, man.

399
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,306
That's it.

400
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:05,910
My boy, D.O.C., he coming in
from Dallas, dope.

401
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:08,579
My little homey, Ren,
rap too. Oh, yeah?

402
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:10,481
Hey, look,
I got these cats--

403
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,716
H.B.O.
Home Boys Only.

404
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:16,220
From New York.
Dope voices, man.

405
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,556
Some wack-ass lyrics
though, man.

406
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:23,727
I'm saying, Cube,
he wrote this shit for 'em. It's crazy.

407
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:26,664
Shit, we could probably
do something with that.

408
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:29,900
That's what I'm saying, man.
Start a label or something, man.

409
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,502
A label?

410
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:33,571
That's pretty fuckin'
farfetched, Dre.

411
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,573
Yeah, but check this out.

412
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:38,576
What would you call
a record label like that?

413
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:46,183
Ruthless.

414
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,085
Ruthless?

415
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,823
Just like these fucking police, nigga. Ruthless.

416
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,758
Let's get the fuck from around here.

417
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
Trying to get me
sent to jail.

418
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,762
Get your simple ass
in the car.

419
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:07,371
What the fuck is "gankin'"?
And what's a "6-4"?

420
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:08,839
Yeah.
It's a car.

421
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,441
A 6-4 Impala.

422
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:13,544
"Gankin'" is when
you jack somebody, man.

423
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:16,480
It's not a big deal.
The shit just sound better.

424
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:19,183
Yo, man, it's too much
cursing for radio play.

425
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:23,554
Besides, who gives a fuck about Compton anyway?
Hey, hold the fuck up.

426
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,725
Hey, y'all got something
to say about Compton?

427
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:30,861
'Cause we might have
a problem up in this bitch.

428
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:35,165
Huh? No?

429
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,569
Then do the lyrics,
'cause I'm really losing my patience.

430
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:40,905
<i>A'ight? Stop fuckin' embarrassing me, man.</i>

431
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:43,741
- Hey, man. I ain't with this shit.
- Yeah, man. Fuck this shit.

432
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:46,410
Fuck this Jheri curl rap bullshit, man.
Fuck you!

433
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:49,213
- Wearing a Kangol don't make you LL Cool J, nigga.
- Fuck you gonna do about it?

434
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,249
- What you gonna do, mark-ass nigga?
- Hey.

435
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:08,265
Let's roll, B.

436
00:26:12,038 --> 00:26:14,872
B-street-lookin' motherfucker.
Fucking Jheri curl-ass.

437
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:17,908
Keep talkin' that bullshit
on your way out the door, nigga.

438
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:28,786
Well, there goes the talent, Dre.
Shut the fuck up, E.

439
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:31,388
I'm just sayin'.
All right.

440
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,425
How the fuck we 'posed to make
a record label and hit records...

441
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,460
and we ain't got no talent?

442
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:41,565
I mean, you said, hold up my side of the deal.
You said, put some money up.

443
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,867
<i>So it's time
for you to deliver.</i>

444
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:51,542
Why don't you
do this shit, E?

445
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:55,446
Nah, for real. Get in there on the mike.
You ain't got shit to lose.

446
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,314
It's your money.
You paying for it.

447
00:26:57,316 --> 00:27:01,285
No, I can't. 'Cause I'm not a rapper.
There's your rapper.

448
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,455
I'm in a group already, man.
Jinx and them would trip on me if I do anything.

449
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,924
I understand that you
wanna keep throwing your life away...

450
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,627
with Jinx and the backyard boogie band or whatever,

451
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,996
but I'm the Berry Gordy
of this shit.

452
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:16,400
So, whenever y'all figure out what y'all wanna do,
just let me know.

453
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:19,803
<i>Come on, man.
Look, the song is about you, E.</i>

454
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:23,007
Eazy-motherfuckin'-E.
I'm telling you.

455
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:26,677
Come on, man.
You the only motherfucker with a 6-4.

456
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,812
You got a 6-4?
I don't have a car.

457
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,448
- You got a 6-4?
- I got a po' Porsche, man.

458
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,684
Nigga, come on, man.

459
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,319
You ain't doing nothing.

460
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,692
But you the businessman,
so, you know, it's on you.

461
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,728
We got a cold-ass song
though.

462
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:48,332
I think you could
hit that shit.

463
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,036
I'm not sold, Dre.

464
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:55,139
What you mean, you not sold?
You just gonna sit there?

465
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,775
You're kinda being
a ho right now, Eric.

466
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,780
Fuck y'all niggas.

467
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:04,715
Berry Gordy
to save the day.

468
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:06,550
I ain't scared.
You ain't scared?

469
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:12,022
- What are you doing?
- E, let me produce. Man.

470
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,827
- Feel like it's getting weird.
- Man, shut up and get comfortable.

471
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,462
Let's go.

472
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:24,234
¶ Cruisin' down the street
in my 6-4 ¶

473
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,570
Shit!
What the fuck?

474
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:31,909
What the fuck is so funny?

475
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:34,378
Nothing. Not--
Oh, E, can you hear me?

476
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,548
Yeah, I can hear you and how
much y'all fuckin' laughing.

477
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,349
No.
Hey, E, you good.

478
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:42,886
Just hit that first beat hard, man.
You gotta come in on beat.

479
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:46,423
<i>Cruisin' down the street.
You cruisin'.</i>

480
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:47,891
You good, Eric.
A'ight? Hey.

481
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:51,161
No, no, no, no. You good,
you good. It's dope.

482
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:52,730
But on beat.

483
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,765
Again. All right?
Let's go.

484
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:57,401
Cruisin'.
All right?

485
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,843
¶ Cruisin' down the street
in my 6-4 ¶

486
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,778
Shit.
That ain't it.

487
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,413
It really ain't.

488
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:12,349
Hey, hey, Dre. He gotta go if we're gonna do this.
Cube, you gotta go.

489
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,619
Get the fuck outta here, Yella.
Now, nigga. Both y'all.

490
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:17,221
- You talking to me?
- Bye!

491
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,556
- Go, Cube! Yella, get the fuck outta here.
- Me too?

492
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:21,425
Yeah, so we can
get this shit done.

493
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,894
"Write the song, Cube.
Shut the fuck up, Cube."

494
00:29:23,896 --> 00:29:25,696
Take these with you, Cube.

495
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:28,065
Yella. Yes, man.
Come on.

496
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:31,135
You know what? Whatever.
Whatever.

497
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:33,303
You motherfucker.
Come on, E.

498
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:36,940
You finished, Dre? You wanna laugh too?
I stay in this bitch by myself.

499
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,809
Hey, just say the words.
A'ight?

500
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:42,212
What does that even mean?
Man, just say the shit with me. All right? Cruisin'.

501
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:44,648
- Cruisin'!
- Yeah, cruisin'. Let's go.

502
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:53,891
¶ Dre, you know this shit
ain't gonna never work ¶

503
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:56,493
A'ight,
you-- you trying to be funny.

504
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:58,962
But you see how you said that shit, right?
Like you believe it.

505
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:02,065
<i>Yeah, I believe that shit.
Then say this shit like you believe it, man.</i>

506
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:06,603
Like it's a motherfuckin' Sunday and you
cruisin' down Crenshaw in a motherfuckin' 6-4.

507
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:09,573
Come on. Say that shit like you believe it, man.
Like it's your words.

508
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:12,910
Feel that shit. Stop playing around.
Loosen the fuck up.

509
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:16,246
<i>There you go.</i>

510
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:22,820
¶ Cruisin' down the street
in my 6-4 ¶

511
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:26,356
Oh, shit.
Hey, that was dope, E.

512
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,959
That shit was dope, man. Yeah!

513
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:31,461
That's what
I'm talking about, man.

514
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:33,664
You feelin' that shit,
right?

515
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:37,467
Now we only got 59 more lines to punch in.
But it's all good. We gonna get through it.

516
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,203
Let's go on
to the next one.

517
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:40,971
<i>¶¶ Jump in!</i>

518
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:43,507
<i>¶ I went to get them out
but there was no bail ¶</i>

519
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,343

Cold cut a fart ¶</i>

523
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,221
<i>¶ On a six-year sentence

524
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,890
<i>¶ Bailiff came over

525
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:02,526
<i>¶ Kilo G looked up
and gave a grin ¶</i>

526
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:05,362

Then came Suzy ¶</i>

527
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,565

<i>¶ Knowing nothing in life

533
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,514
<i>¶ Don't quote me, boy,
'cause I ain't said shit ¶¶</i>

534
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,085
Yes!
All right!

535
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:30,721
Yes!
All right, Eazy.

536
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,356
Hell yes, Dre!

537
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:33,991
Yeah?
Whoo! Yes.

538
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:38,862
Hey, D.O.C. What you think?
You think they gonna feel that shit in Dallas?

539
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:43,267
Man, to be honest, man,
that shit is super dope, nigga. Hell yeah!

540
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,701
For real, nigga.

541
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:47,437
Hey, Lonzo.
What you think?

542
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:51,108
Sound like some
waste-of-time shit to me.

543
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:55,445
Look, this shit ain't gon' work. You ain't gon'
get no radio play with that shit right there.

544
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:57,547
<i>Oh, for real?
Oh, for very real.</i>

545
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:01,184
Wrap this shit up. I need you to get
back on that slow jam we talked about.

546
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:04,755
This whole reality rap shit y'all tryin' to do,
talkin' about low riders and jail,

547
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,757
don't nobody
wanna hear that shit.

548
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:11,028
You need to get back in there and work on
that slow jam that we worked on. I'm serious.

549
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,031
About all you motherfuckers taking up my time,
and that's coming out your pay.

550
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,133
No disrespect, Eazy,
'cause I know you real.

551
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:18,468
But you, motherfucker,
I ain't gonna take that shit from you.

552
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,704
20 years from now,
you gonna fucking thank me. Watch.

553
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:24,808
Twenty years from now, you still gonna be
recording love songs in this dusty-ass garage.

554
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,978
Get the fuck outta here.

555
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,147
Wrap this shit up.
Get your ass out.

556
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:32,282
Yeah, okay.
You got it.

557
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:35,052
<i>No, you got it!</i>

558
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:40,824
- Play that shit again!
- Dre, you a fucking genius.

559
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,993
You a fucking genius.

560
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,594
¶ Went to the park
to get the scoop ¶

561
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:48,065
¶ Knuckleheads out there

<i>¶ A car pulls up Who can it be?</i>

563
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:53,270
<i>¶ A fresh El Camino

564
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:55,939
<i>¶ He rolled down his window
and he started to say ¶</i>

565
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:58,442
<i>¶ It's all about makin'
that G.T.A. ¶</i>

566
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:01,178
<i>¶ 'Cause the boyz 'n the hood

<i>¶ Don't quote me, boys,
'cause I ain't said shit ¶¶</i>

570
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,654
Whoo! These phones are burning up.

571
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,856
This is 1580 KDAY.

572
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:16,526
This is Greg Mack with the Mack Attack,
and I gotta give it up to my boy, Dr. Dre,

573
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:20,297
who's coming with Compton's
very own Eazy-E.

574
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:22,366
And you're listening
to "Boyz-N-The-Hood,"

575
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:26,269
the number-one-requested song
for six weeks and counting.

576
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,175
A'ight.
Guess I'll see you soon.

577
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,511
Excuse me.
Yeah?

578
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,980
I heard your record.

579
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:40,017
I'm Jerry Heller.
Eric Wright.

580
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,053
Real pleasure to meet you, man.
Same here.

581
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:45,455
Uh, would it--

582
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:48,625
Here, let me get those for you.
Let me get those for you.

583
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:52,696
Would it be possible to have a
word with you for a second, Eric?

584
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,631
About what?

585
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,400
About music.

586
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:06,176
So, I thought your album was good, man.
Just good?

587
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:08,045
Mmm.

588
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,416
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No.

589
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,751
I thought
it was exceptional.

590
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,820
Exceptional?
Yes. Fantastic.

591
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:20,157
Please, just sit down.
All right? We'll start this again.

592
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,059
Come on.
All right.

593
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,929
I'm-- I'm gonna
try this again.

594
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:28,665
Okay?
All right.

595
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:33,070
As a music manager,
let me tell you what I can do for you, Eric.

596
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:36,006
I will make you legit.

597
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:40,577
It seems as if I could
do something for you.

598
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,280
I see.

599
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:47,384
You think because I don't have some flashy
office I don't know what I'm talking about?

600
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:50,787
I worked with Elton John.
I worked with Otis Redding.

601
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:55,625
Let me see. I worked with War.
I worked with Styx.

602
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:59,296
Have you worked with
anybody this decade?

603
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:02,499
Let me tell you
what I see here, Eric.

604
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:07,204
A lot of raw talent,
a lot of braggadocio.

605
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,372
Bravado.

606
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:11,408
But if you think anyone's
gonna talk to you,

607
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,944
you think anybody is gonna
let you in the building...

608
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,980
where somebody might listen to you or talk to you,
you think that's gonna happen?

609
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,516
You're crazy, man.
I'm sorry.

610
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:23,086
That is what
I can do for you.

611
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:24,821
I can make you legit.

612
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:28,325
I can get you in that building,
and I will protect you.

613
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:32,395
I will block out all the noise
of this crazy fuckin' business,

614
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,998
and we can build
something big.

615
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,504
But you gotta believe in me the way that I
believe in you, the way that I believe in this.

616
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:44,808
Because you have a unique talent, Eric.
Very special.

617
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,510
Don't fuck around.

618
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:50,247
But you know what?

619
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,483
If you can't handle it,

620
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,386
if it's too much fuckin' pressure for you,
then fine.

621
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:59,523
Get outta here.
Wait.

622
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,759
I'm listening.

623
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:09,366
You got more music
for me?

624
00:36:12,204 --> 00:36:13,803
Absolutely.
Good.

625
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:17,941
'Cause you are gonna have
to follow this up quick.

626
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:19,509
All right?

627
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:23,280
Now, what does N.W.A.
stand for, huh?

628
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:25,448
No Whites Allowed?
Something like that?

629
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,617
Nah.

630
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:31,288
Niggaz With Attitude.

631
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,358
I'll buy that.

632
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:40,864
Good. I like that.
I like that a lot. You better.

633
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,635
Fantastic.

634
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:48,838
Fantastic.

635
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,049
Hey, what up?

636
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:14,397
What's up, fam?
Yeah!

637
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:19,936
Hey.
What's up, baby?

638
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,738
Dre!

639
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,340
How you doin'?

640
00:37:26,445 --> 00:37:31,047
Hey, fellas, y'all got any idea why I
asked y'all to wear all black tonight?

641
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,782
'Cause we a all-star group.

642
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:35,518
And to be a all-star group,
we gotta look like it,

643
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,521
sound like it, dress like it.

644
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,957
You mind tellin' me what the
fuck happened in your situation?

645
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,893
Man, kiss my ass.
This the only clean shit I had left.

646
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:46,963
- That's saying a lot about how you live.
- We getting paid to wear black?

647
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:52,602
Look, I ain't lookin' out for your ass no more, man.
Put this on.

648
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:56,473
- Oh, shit. There go Mr. Drummond.
- Nah, nah.

649
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:59,309
<i>That's Mr. Furley from Three's Company.</i>

650
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:03,713
Hey, that's good, Ren.

651
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,315
Y'all finished?

652
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:08,118
This man been out there
shopping our stuff around,

653
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,253
trying to get money
for Ruthless.

654
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:12,956
He tryin' to get us distribution.
He tryin' to get us on tour.

655
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,959
He could probably bring some real money to the table,
so let's take this shit serious.

656
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,394
Okay.
And then what, E?

657
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:19,663
All he do is
take 20 off the top.

658
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:22,165
We cut 80,

Uh, okay, that was...

729
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,506
one hell of a show.

730
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:50,940

Nice job.
Very, very nice, gentlemen. Outstanding!

00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:03,653
Okay, uh,

Bryan runs
Priority Records,

737
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,562

to sign you.

Yeah, immediately.

739
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,400
Look, fellas, I gotta say,
I loved the show.

740
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:21,571
What you did with that crowd out there,
I mean, I've never seen anything like that.

741
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:24,007
So I think, honestly,
if you all wanted to,

742
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:25,975
you guys would fit perfectly
with our label.

743
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,744
Yes.
That'll work!

744
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:30,647
That'll work. Nah, nah, nah, nah.
No, it w-- Hold on, man.

I've never heard of it.

747
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:38,087

but mostly R & B.

00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:41,424
- Who dat?
- It's, uh, California Raisins.

749
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:43,426
- Who?
- The California Raisins.

750
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:48,765
The raisins from the commercial singing "I
Heard it Through the Grapevine" and shit?

751
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:50,833
Yes, Cube,
the little-ass raisins.

752
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:52,936
That would be the one.

753
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:55,071
Hear it out.
Don't get ahead of yourselves, okay?

754
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,108
I was laughing, too, I promise.
Then I started cashing checks.

755
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:04,047

Excuse me, gentlemen.

They're getting done right now.
Lawyers are drawing 'em up.

00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:55,918
We have a baby, Andre.
You expect me to wait for what you doin' in there?

So sit tight and let us do our job.

849
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:32,715
Officer, I'm sorry. What is going on?
Sir, stay right there, please.

850
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:35,284
We're trying to check these bangers,
make sure they're clean.

851
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:37,720
I'm sorry.
These are not bangers. Okay?

852
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:39,522
These are artists.

853
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,324
Excuse me?
Artists? Yeah.

854
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:42,859
Seriously?
Yeah.

855
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:44,393
What kind of artists?
Rappers.

856
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:46,963
And they're working with me
in the studio right now.

857
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:48,998
Well, see,
rap is not an art.

858
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,633
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm the manager.

859
00:47:50,635 --> 00:47:53,669
- Well, you're wasting your time, Mr. Manager.
- You gotta be kidding me.

860
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:55,371
You're wasting your time.
Really?

861
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:58,908
These clients of yours, these rappers,
they look like gang members.

862
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:02,912
You can't come down here and arrest
people just because of what they look like.

863
00:48:02,914 --> 00:48:05,248
What, are you crazy?
That's police harassment.

864
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,083
You said you're a manager, right? Yeah.

865
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:09,986
Not a fuckin' lawyer.
Does that matter?

866
00:48:09,988 --> 00:48:12,922
You cannot come down here
and harass these guys...

867
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:14,757
because they're black!

868
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:16,759
People have rights!
Step back!

869
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:20,930
I'll step back, you let them up.
Get up, guys. Come on. Eric!

870
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:23,699
You don't tell them to get up.
We will decide that.

871
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:27,270
You have no idea the people I know.
I'm gonna call the mayor's office.

872

You ain't tough now, huh?
Just get to steppin'.

879

889
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:26,595
Get inside, boy.

890
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:28,931
You shut the fuck up!
Hey.

891
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:31,567
Get the fuck back inside.

892
00:49:32,337 --> 00:49:34,136
Get inside, Cube.

893
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:38,574
We're gonna go back and work.
Okay? Leave us alone.

894
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:41,344
- You know? Leave us alone.
- Fuckin' rap music.

Hey, Felicia. You Felicia?
Felicia? Her dude here.

983
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:57,700
All right. So none of y'all
are named Felicia now. Okay.

984
00:53:57,702 --> 00:53:59,602
Yella!

985
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:01,437
Hey, Yella!

986
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:04,106
Your name Felicia?
You forgot my name?

987
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:06,408
No, wait! Valerie.
Your name Valerie.

988
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,377
Whatever.
He forgot her name. Damn!

989
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:10,379
Felicia!
Girl, your nigga's out there.

990
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:13,282
She's suckin' dick though.
He got guns, girl.

991
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:14,783
What?
The nigga is strapped.

992
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:17,419
I'll show this nigga right now.
Talkin' about strapped.

993
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,788
Hey, Ren.
Nigga outside talking about strapped.

994
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,557
Hey!
What's that--

995
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,226
Talkin' 'bout strapped.

996
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:28,130
Let's ride, nigga.
Time to go to work.

997
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,872
Hey.
Y'all looking for Felicia?

998
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:38,474
She in there
or what?

999
00:54:39,543 --> 00:54:42,578
She kinda preoccupied
with some real nigga dick.

1000
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,947
The fuck you say, little nigga?

1001
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:47,449
I said she got a motherfuckin'
dick in her mouth, nigga!

1002
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:50,452
Oh, it ain't fun no more?
The fuck y'all going?

1003
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,589
Nigga, she's trying to compensate.

1004
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:56,825
Wow!
Nigga, them fat niggas was bullshit!

1005
00:54:58,663 --> 00:55:00,996
Punk-ass niggas, man.
Bitch-ass niggas.

1006
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:02,665
Y'all wild.

1007
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:06,168
Nigga runnin' so fast.
That shit was crazy.

1008
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:08,003
Tryin' to get me killed?
Whatever.

1009
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:11,807
Crazy.
Nigga, ain't tryin' to take no bullet for no bitch.

1010
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,475
Bye, Felicia.

1011
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,348
<i>¶ Gangsta, gangsta ¶</i>

1012
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,786

Fuck, man! Hey.
Come on. Put that shit up.

1025
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:57,653
Excuse me!
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

1026
00:55:57,655 --> 00:56:01,323
I don't mean to be the bearer of bad news,
but-- What you got?

1027
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:03,892
Oh, shit.
What's that?

1028
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:07,029
Motherfuckin' FBI.

1029
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:11,300
What the fuck?
I'm supposed to not care about this?

1030
00:56:11,302 --> 00:56:14,236
Wait, the FBI? They comin' after us too?
Kind of.

1031
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:16,305
I mean,
what the letter say, Jerry?

1032
00:56:16,307 --> 00:56:18,474
Uh, basically, uh--

1033
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:20,809
"A song recorded
by the rap group N.W.A....

1034
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:23,312
on their album
'Straight Out Of Compton'...

1035
00:56:23,314 --> 00:56:25,647
encourages violence
against law enforcement.

1036
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:27,916
Advocating violence
and assault is wrong...

1037
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:31,887
and we in the law enforcement
community take exception to such action."

1038
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,389
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

1039
00:56:33,391 --> 00:56:34,923
Fuck the law enforcement
community.

1040
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:37,926
We got freedom of speech.
What the fuck can they do to us?

1041
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:41,530
You wanna provoke 'em and find out?
Because this is a warning, Cube.

1042
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:45,167
And it's about "Fuck Tha Police" in particular, so...

1043
00:56:45,169 --> 00:56:48,937
I think, uh, maybe we should
not play that song right now.

1044
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:51,774
Not play what? Fuck that, Jerry.
That's what the song is about.

1045
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:54,376
Relax, relax.
We're not giving in to anything.

1046
00:56:54,378 --> 00:56:57,179
I just say we retire it for now.
Okay?

1047
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:59,681
It is a reasonably worded
threat.

1048
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:01,417
This isn't,
uh, street bullshit.

1049
00:57:01,419 --> 00:57:04,520
This isn't the Crips and Bloods and crap.
This is the federal government.

1050
00:57:04,522 --> 00:57:07,089
These guys can come after us
a million different ways.

1051
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:09,124
I don't even want to think about it.
Why provoke them?

1052
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:12,461
- The fuck does that mean?
- If it was the LAPD, maybe I'd be a little worried.

1053
00:57:12,463 --> 00:57:14,897
But we can't let them
censor us, Jerry.

1054
00:57:14,899 --> 00:57:16,965
I'm not advocating
for censorship, Cube.

1055
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:21,136
Maybe none of us should be worried.
Maybe we should be happy.

1056
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:22,638
What you mean, E?

1057
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,807
'Cause this right here
is a gift.

1058
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:28,310
It's the FBI, E.
What you talking about? This...

1059
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:31,079
is free publicity
for N.W.A.

1060
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:33,749
We take this to the press
and we show them...

1061
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:36,819
what type of intimidation,
discrimination and harassment...

1062
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:38,821
that we dealing with
from our government.

1063
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:40,589
I like that shit.
I'm with that.

1064
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:42,324
My nigga, I feel you.

1065
00:57:42,326 --> 00:57:45,561
If that's what you wanna do,
then we can-- That's what I wanna do.

1066
00:57:45,563 --> 00:57:48,897
That's what we wanna do, Jerry.
That's it.

1067
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:51,834
That's what we wanna do.

1068
00:57:51,836 --> 00:57:54,002
Okay. Uh--
Yeah?

1069
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:56,171
We good?

1070
00:57:56,173 --> 00:57:58,607
I hate to be the bearer of bad news-- Mm-hmm?

1071
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:00,943
- But 20!
- Twenty, man!

1072
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:04,012
- Wait a minute! That ain't 20!
- Hey, hey, hey!

1073
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:07,416
Shh. Let's not get thrown out
of another fuckin' hotel.

1074
00:58:07,418 --> 00:58:09,017
Good night, Jerry.

1075
00:58:09,019 --> 00:58:12,488
- Compton's crap!
- Go back to Compton!

1076
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:14,790
Ain't that some shit.

1077
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:17,860
Speak a little truth,
and people lose their minds.

1078
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:19,761
This is not music!

1079
00:58:19,763 --> 00:58:23,432
Shit, the truth is,
they can do whatever they want with 'em.

1080
00:58:24,435 --> 00:58:26,101
They bought them
motherfuckers.

1081
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:30,005
¶ I don't drink brass monkey,
Like the beat funky ¶

1082
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,975
¶ Nickname Eazy-E
your eight-ball junkie ¶

1083
00:58:32,977 --> 00:58:35,277
¶ Bass drum kicking
to show my shit ¶

1084
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:37,880
¶ Rapping holding my dick, boy
I don't quit ¶

1085
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:40,949
¶ Crowd-rocking muthafucka
from around the way ¶

1086
00:58:40,951 --> 00:58:43,886
¶ I got a six shooter,
yo' mean hombre ¶

1087
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:46,221
¶ Rolling through the hood
to find the boys ¶

1088
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:48,690
¶ Kick dust and cuss
and crank up some noise ¶

1089
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:51,126
¶ Police on my balls,
I had to pause ¶

1090
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:54,363
¶ 40 ounce in my lap
and it's freezing my balls ¶¶

1091
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:58,333
You gotta slow down.
You can't fuck every broad on the planet.

1092
00:58:58,335 --> 00:59:02,871
- So now pussy a problem?
- It's gonna be a problem if you got 4,000 kids.

1093
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,506
Right?
Yeah.

1094
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:08,076
You make some money, you got all these problems,
you have to take care of 'em.

1095
00:59:08,078 --> 00:59:11,179
It's fine.
I'll help you take care of 'em.

1096
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:14,349
Hey, Cube.
Sorry to interrupt y'all lobster brunch.

1097
00:59:14,351 --> 00:59:17,586
But what's up, E? Where the contracts at, man?
You forgot about me?

1098
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:20,389
Didn't I tell you to-- You know what?
Jerry, you wanna deal with this?

1099
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,925
- I'm not talking to Jerry. I'm talking to you.
- That's Jerry's job.

1100
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:24,760
That is actually--
It's my department.

1101
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:27,062
You're absolutely right
to ask, Cube.

1102
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,064
The contracts are being
finalized as we speak.

1103
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,334
The thing is, with these attorneys,
they'll take forever.

1104
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:35,604
Poring over it, they'll bleed us dry.
But they're gonna get done.

1105
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:38,507
I wish I got paid by the hour
the way they do. You know?

1106
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:40,509
Me too.

1107
00:59:40,511 --> 00:59:44,846
I just want to know what's goin' on,
since I did write a lot of lyrics on this record.

1108
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:49,184
Everybody knows how important you are, Cube.

1109
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:51,520
They do?

1110
00:59:51,522 --> 00:59:53,722
That's what's goin' on.

1111
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:55,824
We just need some time,
that's all.

1112
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:01,196
Everything probably
all right.

1113
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:04,032
I must be trippin'.

1114
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:12,007
Shit tastes pretty good.

1115
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:14,676
Someday, right?

1116
01:00:16,614 --> 01:00:18,981
Y'all enjoy your meal.
Okay.

1117
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:28,557
I'm telling you,
that guy wants to be you very frickin' badly.

1118
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:31,893
As if I ain't got enough fucking problems.
Right? Uh, I've got some problems.

1119
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:34,262
Excuse me.
Can I get another round?

1120
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:37,332
Nah,
I just think you overreacting, man.

1121
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:40,469
Eazy one of us, Cube.
What you thinkin' don't even make sense.

1122
01:00:40,471 --> 01:00:43,405
What don't make sense is Eazy and
Jerry eating steak and lobster...

1123
01:00:43,407 --> 01:00:45,607
and we eating Fatburger.

1124
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:47,275
Shit don't make no sense.

1125
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:51,580
Look, I hear you, but I think
we need to ride this wave.

1126
01:00:51,582 --> 01:00:53,281
For real.

1127
01:00:53,283 --> 01:00:55,851
Don't be jumping to conclusions
until you know for sure.

1128
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:58,220
You know?

1129
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:05,594
It's my moms, man.

1130
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,614
Yo, Dre.

1131
01:01:25,616 --> 01:01:27,516
What's going on?

1132
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:29,184
Um--

1133
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:33,288
Moms just called, man.

1134
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:38,727
It's Tyree.

1135
01:01:39,563 --> 01:01:41,363
He's dead.

1136
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:44,366
- What?
- No.

1137
01:01:44,368 --> 01:01:47,936
He got into a fight.
Some motherfucker broke his neck.

1138
01:01:50,741 --> 01:01:52,974
It's my little brother,
man.

1139
01:01:56,914 --> 01:01:59,114
It's my little baby bro.

1140
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:09,324
Fuckin' Compton, man.

1141
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:12,394
Come on, man, like--

1142
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:14,429
It's my fault, man.

1143
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:16,932
This never would've happened-- Don't talk like that.

1144

It's my fuckin' fault.

1146

If I had just brought him
on tour with me, like he wanted.

1160
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:00,976
Stop this nonsense now.
Stop it.

1161
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,479
Your brother
looked up to you,

1162
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:06,148
and you took
great care of him.

1163
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,383
We both did.

1164
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:11,887
It's time to let someone else take care of him now.

1165
01:03:24,735 --> 01:03:26,735
I'm proud of you.

How do you explain inciting a riot in Detroit?
What do you have to say about that?

1279
01:10:12,242 --> 01:10:15,410
I have to say that, uh,
we didn't incite that shit.

1280
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:18,846
Right. Y'all just got a snapshot
of how Americans really feel.

1281
01:10:18,848 --> 01:10:21,249
We gave the people
a voice.

1282
01:10:21,251 --> 01:10:23,818
We gave
the people truth.

1283
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:28,556
Yeah, but your songs,
they glamorize the lifestyle of gangs, guns, drugs.

1284
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:31,559
Our art is a reflection
of our reality.

1285
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,528
<i>What you see when you go outside your door?</i>

1286
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:35,763
I know what I see.
And it ain't glamorous.

1287
01:10:35,765 --> 01:10:39,567
We get AKs from Russia
and cocaine from Colombia.

1288
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:42,937
- And ain't none of us got a passport, so--
- Yeah.

1289
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:45,240
Might wanna
check the source.

1290
01:10:45,242 --> 01:10:48,776
- Next question. - Will you be more careful
about what you say, how you say it?

1291
01:10:48,778 --> 01:10:50,445
No.
Probably not, no.

1292
01:10:50,447 --> 01:10:54,015
Freedom of speech includes rap music, right?

1293
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:57,685
Well, we exercising our first
amendment as far as I'm concerned.

1294
01:10:57,687 --> 01:11:00,088
And the government wrote that.

1295
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:04,592
So, Cube, what's a guy from Compton do
when he starts making real money like this?

1296
01:11:10,467 --> 01:11:12,300
Cube?

1297
01:11:13,036 --> 01:11:15,270

1298
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:16,804
And curl activator.

1299
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:20,408
Next question.

1300
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:36,991
Good to see you, Cube.

1301
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:39,160
I can barely see you,
Jerry.

1302
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:41,896
<i>What's with all the Godfather shit?</i>

1303
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,333
Okay.

1304
01:11:45,335 --> 01:11:47,735
I know that
you've been very eager...

1305
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:51,239
to sign a contract with Eric's company,
Ruthless Records.

1306
01:11:51,241 --> 01:11:53,474
Eric's company?
Ain't it your company too?

1307
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:57,145
That's incorrect.
It's not my company. I work for you.

1308
01:11:57,147 --> 01:11:58,846
You work for me?
Uh-huh.

1309
01:11:58,848 --> 01:12:01,115
I've made that clear
from the beginning.

1310
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:04,185
All right, cool.
So I could take this to a lawyer or somebody, right?

1311
01:12:04,187 --> 01:12:06,487
Cube, those guys
are paid to make trouble.

1312
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:09,257
They're gonna create problems
where no problems exist.

1313
01:12:09,259 --> 01:12:12,760
Jerry, you know I don't know what
none of this legal shit mean. All right?

1314
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:16,030
None of us do.
We're gonna need a lawyer before we sign anything.

1315
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:18,366
Everybody else
has already signed.

1316
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,502
I thought you knew this.

1317
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,938
You're the only one
who hasn't.

1318
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:30,945
There's also this.

1319
01:12:32,549 --> 01:12:34,449
$75,000.

1320
01:12:37,554 --> 01:12:39,053
Shit.

1321
01:12:39,055 --> 01:12:40,621
Sign the contract...

1322
01:12:40,623 --> 01:12:42,857
and all this money
is yours.

1323
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,827
That's my money anyway, Jerry.
I earned that money.

1324
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:47,995
Now, I wrote a lot of hit songs.
Mm-hmm.

1325
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:50,131
We've been performing
on this tour for months,

1326
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:52,033
sellin' out shows,
sellin' records.

1327
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:55,002
- I know it's plenty of money.
- Really?

1328
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:57,138
Jesus Christ.

1329
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:00,074
Give me my money, Jerry.
How the hell do you think this works?

1330
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:03,811
How the hell do you think
all of this gets paid for?

1331
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:06,714
The hotel rooms,
the tour buses,

1332
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:10,051
security, the parties,
all this shit.

1333
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:13,154
How do you think it gets paid for?
You think it's free? Why are you doing this now?

1334
01:13:13,156 --> 01:13:17,158
If we were so good,
why didn't you give us contracts in the beginning?

1335
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,361
Because nothing
is a sure thing, Cube.

1336
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:24,098
Even a great talent
can crash and burn.

1337
01:13:26,369 --> 01:13:29,270
Too much ego,
too much excess,

1338
01:13:29,272 --> 01:13:31,339
too many expectations.

1339
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,575
It tends to ruin things.

1340
01:13:34,577 --> 01:13:36,811
You ought
to keep that in mind.

1341
01:13:44,454 --> 01:13:46,854
This Eric's company,
right?

1342
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:52,727
Bye, Jerry.

1343
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:54,128
I'm out.

1344
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:22,323
What up, big Suge?

1345
01:14:22,325 --> 01:14:24,325
Here you go.
Thank you, sir.

1346
01:14:24,327 --> 01:14:25,827
Coming up.

1347
01:14:25,829 --> 01:14:28,162
Hey,
what up with D.O.C. and Suge? Hmm?

1348
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:31,566
I guess that dude is
gonna be managing him now.

1349
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:33,835
One day you
Bobby Brown's bodyguard,

1350
01:14:33,837 --> 01:14:36,070
and the next day you
reppin' talent.

1351
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:37,738
Come on, man.

1352
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,908
I guess everybody wanna get into the act, huh?
I guess so.

1353
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,743
All right, man.

1354
01:14:46,616 --> 01:14:48,649
I know, right?

1355
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,852
How you doin'?
You good? Here you go.

1356
01:14:50,854 --> 01:14:53,187
I'm helping you out all I can.
You all right?

1357
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:54,322
Yeah?
Yeah, I'm good.

1358
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:55,890
What's going on?

1359
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,827
You hungry?
Yeah?

1360
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:02,029
I'll be there in a minute.
All right?

1361
01:15:02,031 --> 01:15:03,598
Thanks, man.

1362
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,267
Thanks for everything, bruh.
You bet.

1363
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:10,104
So, Cube, we gonna keep
this momentum going or what?

1364
01:15:10,106 --> 01:15:12,540
Nah, man.
Not like this.

1365
01:15:12,542 --> 01:15:15,042
I'd rather be broke
than to get fucked.

1366
01:15:15,044 --> 01:15:17,044
I told you not
to sign that shit, Dre.

1367
01:15:17,046 --> 01:15:20,281
Nigga, I got bills to pay.
And you know that.

1368
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:23,951
And I gotta put some money in my
mama's hand after Tyree passed, man.

1369
01:15:23,953 --> 01:15:25,453
I feel you.
Right.

1370
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:27,955
We gotta do
what we gotta do.

1371
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:30,224
They're gonna take care of you.
You their bread and butter.

1372
01:15:30,226 --> 01:15:32,393
Cube, we Ruthless.

1373
01:15:32,395 --> 01:15:34,395
We N.W.A.

1374
01:15:34,397 --> 01:15:36,197
They Ruthless.

1375
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:41,202
Cube, you comin'?

1376
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:44,739
I'm about to get out of here.

1377
01:15:45,808 --> 01:15:48,709
Take care of yourself, Dre. Peace.

1378
01:15:57,587 --> 01:16:00,888
- So, you're leaving the group?
- Yeah, I'm through with the bullshit.

1379
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:05,059
Eazy put everything on Jerry.
Jerry put everything on Eazy.

1380
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:07,662
It's a two-man show up there.
Ain't no fuckin' group.

1381
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:10,665
I get that,
but I just want you to understand...

1382
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:14,268
that you are walking away
from a winning situation.

1383
01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:17,271
Now, how do you feel about this, Kim?
Is he making a big mistake?

1384
01:16:17,273 --> 01:16:18,439
A mistake?
Yes.

1385
01:16:18,441 --> 01:16:20,107
I don't think so,
okay?

1386
01:16:20,109 --> 01:16:22,109
After hearing all the stuff that he went through,
I would've left too.

1387
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:25,279
Look, I want you
to express yourself, Cube,

1388
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:27,114
and I am your biggest fan.

1389
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:30,051
I believe in you,
but I just want you to understand...

1390
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:32,453
there's not a lot of money
in this solo play.

1391
01:16:32,455 --> 01:16:33,921
Okay?

1392
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:35,756
But if
the first record hits,

1393
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:38,025
I will make it up to you
on the second one.

1394
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:47,969
Be ready, Bryan.

1395
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:50,071
These records
is comin' in fast.

1396
01:16:50,073 --> 01:16:52,540
¶ I heard payback's
a muthafuckin' nigga ¶

1397
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:55,643
¶ That's why I'm sick of getting
treated like a goddamn stepchild ¶

1398
01:16:55,645 --> 01:16:57,144
¶ Fuck a punk
'cause I ain't him ¶

1399
01:16:57,146 --> 01:16:59,747
¶ You gotta deal with
the nine-double-M ¶

1400
01:16:59,749 --> 01:17:01,248
¶ The damn scum
that you all hate ¶

1401
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,985
¶ Just think if niggas
decide to retaliate ¶

1402
01:17:03,987 --> 01:17:05,720
¶ They try to keep me
from running up ¶

1403
01:17:05,722 --> 01:17:08,656
¶ And never tell you to get
down It's all about coming up ¶

1404
01:17:08,658 --> 01:17:10,658
¶ So what they do?
Go and ban the AK ¶

1405
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:12,927
¶ My shit wasn't registered
any fuckin' way ¶

1406
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:15,296
<i>¶ So you better
duck away Run and hide out ¶</i>

1407
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:17,331
<i>¶ When I'm rolling real slow
and the lights out ¶</i>

1408
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:19,734
<i>¶ 'Cause I'm about
to fuck up the program ¶</i>

1409
01:17:19,736 --> 01:17:22,003
<i>¶ Shooting out the window
of a drop-top Brougham ¶</i>

1410
01:17:22,005 --> 01:17:23,571
<i>¶ When I'm shooting
let's see who drop ¶</i>

1411
01:17:23,573 --> 01:17:26,340
<i>¶ The police, the media,
suckers that went pop ¶</i>

1412
01:17:26,342 --> 01:17:28,476
<i>¶ And muthafuckas
that say they too black ¶</i>

1413
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:30,945
<i>¶ Put 'em overseas They'll be begging to come back ¶</i>

1414
01:17:30,947 --> 01:17:32,680
<i>¶ They say he promote
gangs and drugs ¶</i>

1415
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:35,750
<i>¶ You wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug ¶¶</i>

1416
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:49,296
<i>¶ Now I lay me down
to sleep ¶</i>

1417
01:17:49,298 --> 01:17:52,933
You know Cube's record is in
the Top 20 Billboard right now?

1418
01:17:52,935 --> 01:17:55,369
Our shit never been up there.
He blowin' the fuck up, Jerry.

1419
01:17:55,371 --> 01:17:57,371
It's gonna be fine.
Eric.

1420
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:59,774
It's not just N.W.A. anymore.

1421
01:17:59,776 --> 01:18:01,842
It's our whole
Ruthless roster.

1422
01:18:01,844 --> 01:18:04,845
We got D.O.C. We got Michel'le.
We got Above the Law.

1423
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:07,848
We're moving up
to the next level.

1424
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:09,717
You know what?
Sit down for two seconds.

1425
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:13,354
- Look, we need to keep Dre happy.
- Yeah.

1426
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:16,123
Look at him.
You think he needs any more motivation than that?

1427
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:18,826
I mean, I get it, Jerry.
He drownin' in pussy and shit.

1428
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:21,562
But that don't mean that he-- You-You worry too much.

1429
01:18:21,564 --> 01:18:24,198
Stop, okay?
Yeah, all right.

1430
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,635
Here, sign some checks.
Right now, Jerry?

1431
01:18:27,637 --> 01:18:29,203
Yes, right now.
Oh, come on!

1432
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:31,472
You're gonna be out of your mind later.
Do it now.

1433
01:18:31,474 --> 01:18:34,809
The fact is, Ren is as good a writer as Cube,
maybe even better.

1434
01:18:34,811 --> 01:18:37,878
They got everything covered.
Just the last one.

1435
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,914
Okay?

1436
01:18:39,916 --> 01:18:41,649
Yeah.
We finished here, Jerry?

1437
01:18:41,651 --> 01:18:43,350
We're finished.

1438
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:46,253
Good.
I'm about to go fuck.

1439
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:50,424
All right?
Yeah.

1440
01:18:56,766 --> 01:18:59,667
<i>¶ Most of all
he needs the funk ¶</i>

1441
01:18:59,669 --> 01:19:01,569
<i>¶ Help him find the funk ¶</i>

1442
01:19:01,571 --> 01:19:04,038
<i>¶ Most of all

01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,107

1444
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:08,509
<i>¶ Most of all

1445
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:11,011
<i>- ¶ Help him find the funk ¶
- ¶ Whoa-oh ¶</i>

1446
01:19:11,013 --> 01:19:13,380
<i>¶ Most of all

1447
01:19:13,382 --> 01:19:15,616
<i>¶ Help him find the funk ¶</i>

1448
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:17,918
<i>¶ I know you will ¶</i>

1449
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:20,221
<i>¶ Dance, sucker ¶</i>

1450
01:19:20,223 --> 01:19:22,289
<i>¶ Most of all ¶ ¶ Shine the spotlight on him ¶</i>

1451
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,959
<i>¶ Help him find the funk ¶
¶ Oh, funk me ¶</i>

1452
01:19:24,961 --> 01:19:29,296
<i>¶ Ha da da dee da
hada hada da da ¶¶</i>

1453
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:31,298
Now, I'm only telling you
what you told me.

1454
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,100
<i>If AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted
blew up,</i>

1455
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:35,269
you'd pay me the advance
for the follow-up.

1456
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:37,972
- Now, is that not what the fuck you said?
- That is what I said.

1457
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:40,141
But it is more complicated
than that, Cube.

1458
01:19:40,143 --> 01:19:42,109
All right?
There are metrics-- Come on, Bryan!

1459
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,645
I got a baby on the way
and a house I just paid for...

1460
01:19:44,647 --> 01:19:46,747
off the strength
of what you told me.

1461
01:19:46,749 --> 01:19:48,282
I mean, you gave me
your word.

1462
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:50,484
Cube, would you just calm down?
Calm down?

1463
01:19:50,486 --> 01:19:52,787
- I am just trying to give you what you want.
- You not.

1464
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:56,957
I been did the work. I gave you the product.
Give me my money, Bryan.

1465
01:19:56,959 --> 01:20:00,661
When a man does the job,
he's supposed to get paid,

1466
01:20:00,663 --> 01:20:03,931
and you making it seem like I'm beggin'
for some shit that's technically mine.

1467
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:06,433
Of course
you are not begging.

1468
01:20:06,435 --> 01:20:10,471
And I am not trying to be difficult, man.
I promise you.

1469
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:15,009
But you can't
help me, right?

1470
01:20:15,945 --> 01:20:18,078
That's what

Defamation of character, libel. I don't really care.

01:27:52,201 --> 01:27:53,800
He calls it political?
This is ignorant shit.

1632
01:27:53,802 --> 01:27:56,970
I always knew it.
Now the whole world is gonna know.

1633
01:27:56,972 --> 01:27:58,805
I'm gonna make sure
of that. Okay?

1634
01:27:58,807 --> 01:28:01,642
I don't understand why the fuck
you're not more angry about this.

1635
01:28:01,644 --> 01:28:03,310
- Did you hear what he said?
- I heard what he said!

1636
01:28:03,312 --> 01:28:04,911
Did you hear what he said?
I heard what he said!

1637
01:28:04,913 --> 01:28:06,446
About you? About me?
Come on!

1638
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:09,316
You got your way of dealing with it.
I got mine.

1639
01:28:13,622 --> 01:28:16,890
We could just go to the studio and
just end his fucking career anyway.

1640
01:28:17,893 --> 01:28:20,227
I don't know about all that.

1641
01:28:21,764 --> 01:28:25,666
Fine. You do that. You call Dre,
and you guys go do that.

1642
01:28:25,668 --> 01:28:27,301
Do something.

1643
01:28:31,073 --> 01:28:33,940

1661
01:29:36,572 --> 01:29:40,374
- You know what I'm saying?
- Dre, maybe we should try to get back to work.

1662
01:29:40,376 --> 01:29:42,242
We are working, Jerry.

1663
01:29:42,244 --> 01:29:44,077
I'm having a word

Who's asking?

1675
01:30:43,572 --> 01:30:45,906
It's a nice house.

1676

You're with, uh,

Someone else?
Ice Cube?

1679

Have yourself a good night.

1680
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:03,890
Jerry.

1681
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:16,503

1684
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,687
So, what's up?

1685
01:31:35,023 --> 01:31:36,756
When you talked to me
on the phone, man,

1686
01:31:36,758 --> 01:31:38,892
you sounded
pretty worked up.

1687
01:31:43,031 --> 01:31:45,198
Yeah, I know you don't like hearing this shit.

1688
01:31:46,802 --> 01:31:50,036
It's about Jerry, man.
We gotta get rid of that motherfucker, E.

1689
01:31:51,773 --> 01:31:54,674
That's really
why you came here?

1690
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:57,043
I thought all this shit
was in the past, Dre.

1691
01:32:00,215 --> 01:32:03,383
This some real shit, man.
And the shit been happening since the beginning.

1692
01:32:03,385 --> 01:32:05,385
I had some people
look into this.

1693
01:32:05,387 --> 01:32:06,853
I ain't been gettin'
my fair share.

1694
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:08,688
Do you even know
why you rich though?

1695
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:10,724
Do you know why you
got a big-ass house...

1696
01:32:10,726 --> 01:32:12,792
and you ain't sleepin' on your auntie couch no more?

1697
01:32:12,794 --> 01:32:15,328
Because Jerry made
that possible for us.

1698
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:18,465
He kicked down the door for that shit to happen.
For us.

1699
01:32:18,467 --> 01:32:21,134
And you just gonna turn your back on him?
What, you Cube now?

1700
01:32:21,136 --> 01:32:23,737
Cube was right, fool.

1701
01:32:23,739 --> 01:32:27,741
Eazy, look at the papers, man,
and you'll see what the fuck I'm talkin' about.

1702
01:32:27,743 --> 01:32:31,912
And forget about Jerry, man!
You keep talking about Jerry this, Jerry that.

1703
01:32:31,914 --> 01:32:33,580
We didn't make it
because of Jerry.

1704
01:32:33,582 --> 01:32:35,649
We made it because
our shit is dope.

1705
01:32:37,519 --> 01:32:39,252
And we can keep going, E.

1706
01:32:39,254 --> 01:32:43,723
We can own the goddamn world,
but we just can't be fucking with him no more.

1707
01:32:45,761 --> 01:32:48,662
Man, we started
this N.W.A. shit.

1708
01:32:50,866 --> 01:32:52,666
I just want it
to be right.

1709
01:32:52,668 --> 01:32:55,168
And this
what you think right?

1710
01:32:56,605 --> 01:32:59,339
Turnin' your back on somebody
after all he done for us.

1711
01:32:59,341 --> 01:33:02,075
You mean
all he done for you.

1712
01:33:03,111 --> 01:33:04,678
Right?

1713
01:33:06,114 --> 01:33:07,681
Look at me.

1714
01:33:10,052 --> 01:33:11,685
Look at me.

1715
01:33:15,591 --> 01:33:17,757
When Tyree died...

1716
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:22,929
you said we was always
gonna be brothers.

1717
01:33:23,899 --> 01:33:25,999
But I guess you
forgot about that.

1718
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:32,272
I'm-a start my own company with Suge Knight, E.

1719
01:33:45,721 --> 01:33:47,821

1731
01:34:32,601 --> 01:34:34,768

01:35:07,803 --> 01:35:10,203
You see that little look he gave me?
Yeah.

This what's gonna happen.

1795
01:37:18,533 --> 01:37:20,200
You gonna sign these,

1796
01:37:20,202 --> 01:37:22,902
releasing Dre and D.O.C.
from Ruthless.

1797
01:37:27,542 --> 01:37:29,108
Whatever, homey.

1798
01:37:32,547 --> 01:37:35,548
You think I'm signing that,
you crazier than I thought you was.

1799
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:37,183
I'm out.

1800
01:37:40,889 --> 01:37:43,389
Get your ass up.

1801
01:37:43,391 --> 01:37:46,693
Nah. I think you're
gonna stay here for a while.

1802
01:37:46,695 --> 01:37:48,895
Fuck you, Suge!

1803
01:37:48,897 --> 01:37:50,897
Y'all niggas don't scare me.

1804
01:37:50,899 --> 01:37:53,566
You can talk tough
all you want,

1805
01:37:53,568 --> 01:37:55,735
but this ain't no record.

1806
01:37:55,737 --> 01:37:57,704
Don't make me
change you, Eric.

1807
01:37:57,706 --> 01:37:59,372
Fuck that's
supposed to mean?

1808
01:37:59,374 --> 01:38:01,875
Keep talkin'.
You're gonna fuck around and get smoked.

1809
01:38:01,877 --> 01:38:04,911
Nah, nah.
But you better choose right.

1810
01:38:04,913 --> 01:38:07,347
You know
where the fuck I'm from.

1811
01:38:07,349 --> 01:38:09,482
This Bompton, nigga.

1812
01:38:31,907 --> 01:38:33,907
Oh, my fucking God.

1813
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:36,876
Eric.
Jesus Christ.

1814
01:38:36,878 --> 01:38:38,945
God, what's going on, man?

1815
01:38:38,947 --> 01:38:41,214
Are you okay?

1816
01:38:41,216 --> 01:38:44,851
I gotta kill
this motherfucker Suge Knight.

1817
01:38:46,354 --> 01:38:49,055
I just came here
to let you know, 'cause...

1818
01:38:49,057 --> 01:38:50,690
shit might get
a little thick.

1819
01:38:50,692 --> 01:38:53,026
I need to stay protected.

1820
01:38:53,929 --> 01:38:57,196
No, you're not
gonna do that. No.

1821
01:38:57,198 --> 01:38:59,599
I didn't come here
to ask for permission.

1822
01:38:59,601 --> 01:39:02,402
I came here
to let you know.

1823
01:39:02,404 --> 01:39:06,139
You wanted to be involved with this gangster shit?
Here we go.

1824
01:39:06,141 --> 01:39:10,543
You do that,
and you're gonna ruin everything we've worked for.

1825
01:39:12,147 --> 01:39:14,647
You really think
I got a fucking choice?

1826
01:39:14,649 --> 01:39:16,349
Look at my face!

1827
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:20,887
This the streets.
Motherfuckers came at me!

1828
01:39:20,889 --> 01:39:23,256
Came at us!

1829
01:39:23,258 --> 01:39:25,325
If I don't hit back,
we finished. It's over.

1830
01:39:25,327 --> 01:39:27,160
I'm not saying that we're not gonna hit back.

1831
01:39:27,162 --> 01:39:29,228
But this is
not Compton...

1832
01:39:30,298 --> 01:39:31,998
if you haven't
looked around.

1833
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,634
Drop that shit, okay?

1834
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:38,004
We don't hit back with bullets.
We hit back with lawyers.

1835
01:39:38,006 --> 01:39:41,074
We drain these assholes.
That really takes 'em down.

1836
01:39:41,076 --> 01:39:44,077
It ain't
about the money, Jerry.

1837
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:47,246
I don't care about no money.
Of course it is.

1838
01:39:47,248 --> 01:39:49,415
And you should fucking care about the money.

1839
01:39:50,585 --> 01:39:53,519
You're so much smarter
than these fucking thugs.

1840
01:39:53,521 --> 01:39:57,056
You wanna kill somebody?
You're gonna go to jail forever.

1841
01:40:00,028 --> 01:40:02,695
No more family, no more Ruthless,
no more anything.

1842
01:40:02,697 --> 01:40:04,864
If you kill this man,
his problems will be over...

1843
01:40:04,866 --> 01:40:07,300
and yours will
just be beginning.

1844
01:40:07,302 --> 01:40:09,435
Don't be
a fucking fool.

1845
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:11,938
Hey.

1846
01:40:13,008 --> 01:40:15,942
Why the fuck I gotta be
the bigger man?

1847
01:40:16,978 --> 01:40:19,112
'Cause it's better
than you being a dead man.

1848
01:40:19,114 --> 01:40:21,280
I don't want you
fucking dead.

1849
01:40:47,509 --> 01:40:50,476
Damn, Dre. What the fuck is that?
Feelin' that shit.

1850
01:40:50,478 --> 01:40:52,011
Yeah, you feelin' it?
Yeah!

1851
01:40:52,013 --> 01:40:54,480
Hey, hey, look,
I'm gonna spit a little something. All right.

1852
01:40:54,482 --> 01:40:56,649
You feel me?
You say whatever-- You just jump in, nigga, and just...

1853
01:40:56,651 --> 01:40:58,751
Hold on. Look, I got something.
Here we go.

1854
01:41:00,088 --> 01:41:02,655
¶ One, two, three
and to the four ¶

1855
01:41:02,657 --> 01:41:05,258
¶ Snoop Doggy Dogg
and Dr. Dre is at the door ¶

1856
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:07,427
¶ Ready to make an entrance,
so back on up ¶

1857
01:41:07,429 --> 01:41:09,429
¶ 'Cause you know
we about to rip shit up ¶

1858
01:41:09,431 --> 01:41:12,198
¶ Gimme the microphone first
so I could bust like a bubble ¶

1859
01:41:12,200 --> 01:41:14,600
¶ Compton and Long Beach together
Now you know you in trouble ¶

1860
01:41:14,602 --> 01:41:17,703
Uh-huh.
¶ Ain't nuthin' but a "G" thang, baby ¶

1861
01:41:17,705 --> 01:41:20,339
¶ Two loc'ed out niggas,
so we're crazy ¶ Uh-huh.

1862
01:41:20,341 --> 01:41:22,909
¶ Death Row is the label
that pays me ¶

1863
01:41:22,911 --> 01:41:25,511
¶ Un-fadable,
so please don't try and fade this ¶ Ooh!

1864
01:41:25,513 --> 01:41:28,748
¶ But back
to the lecture at hand ¶

1865
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:31,117
<i>¶¶ I wanna thank you for having us here.</i>

1866
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:33,586
- Of course.
- Very generous for you to give of your time...

1867
01:41:33,588 --> 01:41:36,022
with, uh, everything
that's going on right now.

1868
01:41:36,024 --> 01:41:37,690
Not a problem.

1869
01:41:37,692 --> 01:41:39,358
Now, if I may--

1870
01:41:40,295 --> 01:41:42,862
Are you anti-Semitic?

1871
01:41:42,864 --> 01:41:45,465
Now, I thought this was about the Rodney King trial.

1872
01:41:45,467 --> 01:41:47,800
Well, the JDL
recently got involved,

1873
01:41:47,802 --> 01:41:50,703
citing the lyrics about your former manager,
Jerry Heller.

1874
01:41:50,705 --> 01:41:52,305
I'm not anti-Semitic.

1875
01:41:52,307 --> 01:41:55,441
I'm anti-Jerry Heller.
Let me ask you something.

1876
01:41:55,443 --> 01:41:59,145
Do the JDL condone Jerry's behavior
when it comes to my situation?

1877
01:41:59,147 --> 01:42:02,615
Him trying to get me to sign a
contract without legal representation?

1878
01:42:02,617 --> 01:42:05,451
- I have no idea.
- I didn't think you did.

1879
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:08,154
But when you got that for me,
we can continue on this topic.

1880
01:42:08,156 --> 01:42:09,755
Until then,
I'm here to talk...

1881
01:42:09,757 --> 01:42:13,392
about the beating of an unarmed motorist,
Rodney King,

1882
01:42:13,394 --> 01:42:16,162
and four guilty
LAPD officers...

1883
01:42:16,164 --> 01:42:19,065
who seem to be Daryl Gates's standard issue.

1884
01:42:20,135 --> 01:42:22,401
It's also the LAPD
and the FBI...

1885
01:42:22,403 --> 01:42:25,338
who feel that your negative portrayal
of police condones violence.

1886
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:28,407
"Fuck tha Police" is
just a warning, that's it.

1887
01:42:28,409 --> 01:42:31,978
You can't treat people like that
and expect 'em not to rise up.

1888
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:34,180
I'm a journalist
just like you--

1889
01:42:34,182 --> 01:42:36,015
reporting what's goin' on in the hood.

1890
01:42:36,017 --> 01:42:39,252
The only thing that's different is that I'm brutally honest.

1891
01:42:41,523 --> 01:42:43,723
And what's your relationship
with the Nation of Islam?

1892
01:42:45,026 --> 01:42:46,692
They my brothers.

1893
01:42:46,694 --> 01:42:48,794
You know what?
That question right there proves to me...

1894
01:42:48,796 --> 01:42:51,697
what kind of a unprepared
sandbag reporter you are.

1895
01:42:51,699 --> 01:42:53,933
You talkin' to me like I'm some elected official,

1896
01:42:53,935 --> 01:42:56,002
like I'm running
for office.

1897
01:42:56,004 --> 01:42:57,837
But I get it.
That's your job.

1898
01:42:57,839 --> 01:43:00,439
Bigger the story,
the bigger the check in your field of work.

1899
01:43:00,441 --> 01:43:02,375
It's not your fault.
I shouldn't blame you.

1900
01:43:02,377 --> 01:43:05,444
What's your name, man?
Brian.

1901
01:43:05,446 --> 01:43:08,681
Eat a dick, Brian.
Get the fuck out my house. Y'all done here.

1902
01:43:09,717 --> 01:43:11,984
Can we cut, please?

1903
01:43:11,986 --> 01:43:15,388
<i>¶ So wide can't get around it ¶</i>

1904
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:19,358
<i>¶ So low you can't
get under it ¶</i>

1905
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:22,228
<i>¶ So high
you can't get over it ¶</i>

1906
01:43:22,230 --> 01:43:26,165
<i>¶ So high you can't
get over it ¶</i>

1907
01:43:26,167 --> 01:43:28,134
<i>¶ Da-ah ¶</i>

1908
01:43:28,136 --> 01:43:30,703
<i>¶ This is a chance
This is a chance ¶</i>

1909
01:43:30,705 --> 01:43:33,372
<i>¶ Da-ah ¶
¶ To dance your way ¶</i>

1910
01:43:34,742 --> 01:43:38,544
<i>- ¶ Da-ah ¶
- ¶ Out of your constrictions ¶</i>

1911
01:43:38,546 --> 01:43:40,346
<i>¶ Da-ah ¶</i>

1912
01:43:40,348 --> 01:43:42,148
<i>¶ Da sukum ¶</i>

1913
01:43:43,251 --> 01:43:45,918
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

1914
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,420
You look like
you're ready to go.

1915
01:43:47,422 --> 01:43:50,590
Yeah. I'm just waiting on my friend.
I should've drove.

1916
01:43:50,592 --> 01:43:54,493
You're not havin' a good time?
No, no. No. I had a really good time.

1917
01:43:54,495 --> 01:43:57,430
But now it's starting
to get a little wild.

1918
01:43:57,432 --> 01:44:00,666
Yeah.
We've been known to get crazy from time to time.

1919
01:44:02,437 --> 01:44:05,738
I'm Andre.
I'm Nicole.

1920
01:44:07,542 --> 01:44:08,507
Suge.
Hey.

1921
01:44:08,509 --> 01:44:10,443
How you doin'?
All right.

1922
01:44:10,445 --> 01:44:12,111
Jimmy Iovine,
Interscope Records.

1923
01:44:12,113 --> 01:44:14,080
Nice to meet you.
You too.

1924
01:44:14,082 --> 01:44:17,183
So, what do I call you?
Dre? Dr. Dre? Doc?

1925
01:44:17,185 --> 01:44:18,751
Nah, Dre is cool.

1926
01:44:18,753 --> 01:44:20,786
Go ahead.
Have a seat. All right.

1927
01:44:20,788 --> 01:44:22,355
It's good.
Yeah.

1928
01:44:22,357 --> 01:44:25,291
- So, what do you got today?
- Um--

1929
01:44:25,293 --> 01:44:27,126
Well, you know.

1930
01:44:27,128 --> 01:44:30,396
I heard John McClain
gave you my album.

1931
01:44:30,398 --> 01:44:32,431
What'd you think?

1932
01:44:32,433 --> 01:44:34,133
I don't know anything
about hip-hop,

1933
01:44:34,135 --> 01:44:36,135
but I know
that this is special.

1934
01:44:36,137 --> 01:44:37,837
Seriously.

1935
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:40,873
Thank you.

1936
01:44:40,875 --> 01:44:44,810
Look, we'd love to bring in Interscope,
but there's a little problem.

1937
01:44:44,812 --> 01:44:46,279
What's the problem?

1938
01:44:46,281 --> 01:44:48,814
Ruthless, lawsuits...

1939
01:44:48,816 --> 01:44:51,050
and contracts.

1940
01:44:51,052 --> 01:44:52,985
Well, how about this?

1941
01:44:52,987 --> 01:44:55,755
You give me three weeks,
and I don't wanna hear any bullshit...

1942
01:44:55,757 --> 01:44:57,657
about you shopping this
anywhere around town.

1943
01:44:57,659 --> 01:44:59,992
If you do that,

1944
01:44:59,994 --> 01:45:03,562
I believe I can solve your problem with the contract.

1945
01:45:07,969 --> 01:45:09,735
Lil' nigga,
you in my spot?

1946
01:45:11,172 --> 01:45:12,938
Yo.
Hey, Suge.

1947
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:16,008
Suge. Easy, man,
yo-- Hey, Suge, what the--

1948
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:18,644
Hey, Suge.
You parked in my motherfuckin' spot or what?

1949
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:20,846
- I didn't-- I didn't know, man.
- It's cool.

1950
01:45:20,848 --> 01:45:22,581
You little fuck!

1951
01:45:22,583 --> 01:45:23,716
Suge!

1952
01:45:26,287 --> 01:45:28,688
Suge, it's just a parking spot.
Get off of me!

1953
01:45:28,690 --> 01:45:30,389
Come on!

1954
01:45:33,494 --> 01:45:35,828
Move this piece
of shit.

1955
01:45:37,365 --> 01:45:39,865
And park my car.

1956
01:45:39,867 --> 01:45:42,368
And I better not see one drop
of blood on that motherfucker.

1957
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:44,337
Suge, let's go, man.

1958
01:45:50,311 --> 01:45:53,512
<i>The jury in the Rodney King
case has delivered its verdict,</i>

1959
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:56,349
<i>and not one
of the four police officers...</i>

1960
01:45:56,351 --> 01:45:58,884
<i>seen on videotape
beating Mr. King a year ago...</i>

1961
01:45:58,886 --> 01:46:00,720
<i>is guilty
of using excessive force.</i>

1962
01:46:00,722 --> 01:46:02,388
<i>They've all been found
not guilty.</i>

1963
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:04,390
Oh, for Christ's sake.

1964
01:46:04,392 --> 01:46:06,659
<i>Oh, my God.
Judy, the details.</i>

1965
01:46:06,661 --> 01:46:08,961
<i>Peter, it was a clean sweep
for the defendants.</i>

1966
01:46:08,963 --> 01:46:10,830
<i>Not guilty,
the verdict for all of them.</i>

1967
01:46:10,832 --> 01:46:13,032
<i>Only on one count against Lawrence Powell...
I'm sorry.</i>

1968
01:46:13,034 --> 01:46:15,234
<i>On excessive use of force
under color of authority...</i>

1969
01:46:15,236 --> 01:46:18,070
<i>could the jury not agree.</i>

1970
01:46:19,907 --> 01:46:23,409
<i>It's probably the worst case of
police misconduct that I've ever seen.</i>

1971
01:46:23,411 --> 01:46:24,910
Fuck the police!

1972
01:46:24,912 --> 01:46:27,847
Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!

1973
01:46:27,849 --> 01:46:30,049
<i>...especially to our police department.</i>

1974
01:46:30,051 --> 01:46:33,919
<i>It looks kind of like
we're in a war zone though.</i>

1975
01:46:33,921 --> 01:46:36,389
<i>We've got some
courageous shop owners here, who are armed.</i>

1976
01:46:36,391 --> 01:46:40,860
<i>Anarchy is obviously a
statement of political dissatisfaction.</i>

1977
01:46:40,862 --> 01:46:42,695
<i>Police officers are still back down...</i>

1978
01:46:42,697 --> 01:46:45,431
<i>guarding the area down there
where the Ralph's...</i>

1979
01:46:45,433 --> 01:46:47,533
<i>...the police are using,
eerily reminiscent...</i>

1980
01:46:47,535 --> 01:46:49,101
<i>of military-style
assault weapons.</i>

1981
01:46:49,103 --> 01:46:51,704
<i>You can
hear random gunshots as rioters...</i>

1982
01:46:51,706 --> 01:46:54,974
<i>The cars have been left abandoned,
because their drivers...</i>

1983
01:46:56,344 --> 01:46:58,878
<i>We show you,
and that police presence...</i>

1984
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,680
<i>We have fires burning.</i>

1985
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:04,950
<i>Olympic. Pico.</i>

1986
01:47:04,952 --> 01:47:07,286
No justice, no peace!

1987
01:47:07,288 --> 01:47:08,954
<i>More than 100 injured,</i>

1988
01:47:08,956 --> 01:47:11,824
<i>mostly in the South-Central
section of Los Angeles.</i>

1989
01:47:35,650 --> 01:47:39,218
You know, if we bag all this shit up in ounces,
we should probably be straight.

1990
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:41,053
Looks like we got enough.

1991
01:47:41,055 --> 01:47:43,756
So,
all this weed is for your Ruthless artists?

1992
01:47:43,758 --> 01:47:46,425
I'm tryin' to take care of these
little money problems, man, so--

1993
01:47:46,427 --> 01:47:47,960
They can smoke it,
sell it.

1994
01:47:47,962 --> 01:47:49,929
Fuck, throw a party on it,
for all I give a fuck.

1995
01:47:49,931 --> 01:47:53,966
As long as I just have some time to figure this shit out,
you know?

1996
01:47:55,236 --> 01:47:58,904
Yo, man,
you straight?

1997
01:47:59,841 --> 01:48:01,841
E, you straight?
Yeah, I'm good.

1998
01:48:01,843 --> 01:48:05,077
- No, for real, man. You straight?
- Man, I'm good!

1999
01:48:05,079 --> 01:48:07,947
I'm just fucking tired, man.
I'm fucking downgrading houses.

2000
01:48:07,949 --> 01:48:10,683
How would you feel?
Answer me that.

2001
01:48:10,685 --> 01:48:12,918
Dre rolled out.
Ruthless money low.

2002
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:15,488
Tomica asking me all kind of questions about the house.

2003
01:48:15,490 --> 01:48:18,858
Answer me this.
Would you be all right?

2004
01:48:18,860 --> 01:48:21,494
Would you be all right
moving out your fucking house?

2005
01:48:21,496 --> 01:48:23,362
You all right with it?
E, I'm your boy.

2006
01:48:23,364 --> 01:48:25,798
I'm-- I'm in this shit
with you.

2007
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:27,633
I'm just trying to make sure you good, bruh.

2008
01:48:27,635 --> 01:48:29,535
I'm good!
You good?

2009
01:48:29,537 --> 01:48:31,203
- You good?
- Yeah, man.

2010
01:48:31,205 --> 01:48:32,705
Eric.

2011
01:48:32,707 --> 01:48:34,840
- What, Jerry?
- Take it easy.

2012
01:48:34,842 --> 01:48:36,876
You know what?
Let's get you out of the house.

2013
01:48:36,878 --> 01:48:39,178
I have stuff needs
your autograph, okay?

2014
01:48:40,515 --> 01:48:43,048
I'll come when I have time, Jerry.
Eric, come on.

2015
01:48:45,853 --> 01:48:47,553
We still got
a business to run.

2016
01:48:47,555 --> 01:48:49,288
Don't it look like I'm
running business right now?

2017
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:51,557
No.
It looks like you're fucking cutting up weed.

2018
01:48:51,559 --> 01:48:54,627
I thought that was a job
for fucking jackasses.

2019
01:48:56,664 --> 01:48:58,631
You know what, Jerry?

2020
01:48:59,834 --> 01:49:01,467
You right.

2021
01:49:01,469 --> 01:49:04,403
You absolutely
fuckin' right.

2022
01:49:04,405 --> 01:49:06,805
We got business
to take care of.

2023
01:49:07,575 --> 01:49:09,808
I'll see you in a minute.

2024
01:49:15,483 --> 01:49:19,752
"You got knocked the fuck out."

2025
01:49:22,557 --> 01:49:24,223
That shit is funny.

2026
01:49:24,225 --> 01:49:25,691
Hey, baby.
Hey, baby.

2027
01:49:25,693 --> 01:49:27,326
<i>How's Friday coming?</i>

2028
01:49:27,328 --> 01:49:29,261
This shit is funny.

2029
01:49:29,263 --> 01:49:30,596
I'm feeling it
though.

2030
01:49:30,598 --> 01:49:32,932
Hmm.
What page are you on?

2031
01:49:32,934 --> 01:49:34,533
100.

2032
01:49:34,535 --> 01:49:36,402
I'm not going
too much longer though.

2033
01:49:36,404 --> 01:49:38,270
Baby, come here.
Look!

2034
01:49:38,272 --> 01:49:40,706
<i>¶ Going off on everybody like that ¶</i>

2035
01:49:40,708 --> 01:49:42,408

2040
01:49:51,052 --> 01:49:53,218
<i>What?
¶ With a crime record like Charles Manson ¶</i>

2041
01:49:53,220 --> 01:49:55,721
We left a lot of good records on the table.

2042
01:49:55,723 --> 01:49:57,756
<i>¶ Now you know that
I'm about to act a fool ¶¶</i>

2043
01:50:31,559 --> 01:50:34,393
<i>It's like I don't even
know what I'm doing no more.</i>

2044
01:50:34,395 --> 01:50:36,962
I don't know
where the money going.

2045
01:50:36,964 --> 01:50:38,897
Why you stressin'?

2046
01:50:38,899 --> 01:50:41,000
You know
I know the business.

2047
01:50:41,002 --> 01:50:46,138
Just-- Shit, just lay out all the files, contracts,
whatever it is,

2048
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:48,107
and I'll look into it.

2049
01:50:48,109 --> 01:50:50,809
For real.
Come here.

2050
01:50:53,147 --> 01:50:54,747
Come here.

2051
01:51:00,955 --> 01:51:03,856
You just go
to New York.

2052
01:51:03,858 --> 01:51:08,661
You take care of this big ol'
distribution deal with Sony.

2053
01:51:08,663 --> 01:51:11,296
Bring that shit on in.

2054
01:51:11,298 --> 01:51:13,132
All right?

2055
01:51:13,134 --> 01:51:15,334
And I'll check
into everything else.

2056
01:51:19,607 --> 01:51:21,306
I love you.

2057
01:51:21,308 --> 01:51:23,642
You what?
I love you.

2058
01:51:23,644 --> 01:51:25,878
You what?

01:51:29,183 --> 01:51:30,949
What's up?

2060
01:51:30,951 --> 01:51:34,053
All right.
Good night.

2061
01:51:34,055 --> 01:51:37,623
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Really? Good night?

2062
01:51:37,625 --> 01:51:39,224
You okay
to drive?

2063
01:51:40,561 --> 01:51:43,228
No. Look at you.

2064
01:51:43,230 --> 01:51:45,164
Good night, Andre.
Nah.

2065
01:51:45,166 --> 01:51:46,899
See--

2066
01:51:46,901 --> 01:51:50,402
See, I can't help thinking maybe
you want me to come inside.

2067
01:51:50,404 --> 01:51:51,904
Of course I do.

2068
01:51:51,906 --> 01:51:54,707
So, what's
different now? Huh?

2069
01:51:54,709 --> 01:51:57,476
I got a lot to think about.

2070
01:51:57,478 --> 01:52:02,081
You're asking me to move in with you.
That is a huge step.

2071
01:52:02,083 --> 01:52:06,585
I like you, Andre,
but there's a lot going on around you.

2072
01:52:06,587 --> 01:52:08,287
What you mean?

2073
01:52:09,356 --> 01:52:12,024
I know about the whole
Death Row business,

2074
01:52:12,026 --> 01:52:14,893
the assault charges,
the shooting.

2075
01:52:14,895 --> 01:52:17,362
Just seems dangerous.

2076
01:52:17,364 --> 01:52:20,232
My son is my world.

2077
01:52:24,004 --> 01:52:25,938

01:54:58,726 --> 01:55:01,193
And may the West Coast
reign forever.

2126
01:55:01,195 --> 01:55:03,762
Come on.
Come on.

2127
01:55:03,764 --> 01:55:06,932
And may the West Coast reign forever.
Bitch-ass nigga.

2128
01:55:06,934 --> 01:55:09,501
Now toast
to Dr. Dre.

2129
01:55:09,503 --> 01:55:11,603
That's right.
Put your glass down.

2130
01:55:13,207 --> 01:55:15,240
I said, put the fucking
glasses down!

2131
01:55:15,242 --> 01:55:17,776
Hey, yo, slow your roll, Dre.
Come on.

2132
01:55:17,778 --> 01:55:20,212
This why we got money?

2133
01:55:20,214 --> 01:55:22,281
To act like we ain't
got no goddamn sense?

2134
01:55:22,283 --> 01:55:25,384
We coulda did all this dumb shit back in Compton.

2135
01:55:25,386 --> 01:55:27,953
But this what the fuck
y'all turn into.

2136
01:55:27,955 --> 01:55:31,523
You sittin' up here eatin' fuckin' crab.
Who the fuck are you? Huh?

2137
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:36,862
This my motherfucking name
on the wall, man!

2138
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:41,400
And y'all in here acting like y'all
on motherfucking vacation.

2139
01:55:41,402 --> 01:55:44,569
I got Pac in the next
motherfucking room,

2140
01:55:44,571 --> 01:55:46,805
grindin', man, workin'!

2141
01:55:46,807 --> 01:55:50,242
And y'all niggas
in here partyin'?

2142
01:55:51,779 --> 01:55:53,378
One time?

2143
01:55:55,482 --> 01:55:57,382
You trippin'.
That's right.

2144
01:55:57,384 --> 01:55:59,952
Yeah.
We can do anything we wanna do.

2145
01:55:59,954 --> 01:56:02,654
We started this thing.
This is us.

2146
01:56:02,656 --> 01:56:04,890
Nah, nigga.
Death Row, that's us.

2147
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:08,360
I don't know
what the fuck this shit is.

2148
01:56:09,763 --> 01:56:11,430
Better watch
your mouth, blood.

2149
01:56:11,432 --> 01:56:13,732
And who the fuck
you talking to, huh?

2150
01:56:13,734 --> 01:56:16,902
Nigga, you ain't nothin' but a producer.
Get the fuck out my face!

2151
01:56:16,904 --> 01:56:20,339
- Yo, yo, yo!
- Get him off me, man!

2152
01:56:20,341 --> 01:56:23,175
- Dude!
- Get the fuck off me, man!

2153
01:56:23,177 --> 01:56:27,346
Ah, shit!

2154
01:56:28,515 --> 01:56:30,215
Dre.

2155
01:56:31,418 --> 01:56:33,518
This is bullshit.

2156
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,087
Dre!

2157
01:56:51,205 --> 01:56:53,271
Always fucking with me!

2158
01:57:31,145 --> 01:57:33,412
Drop the keys out of the window!

2159
01:57:33,414 --> 01:57:34,713
Open the door.

2160
01:57:36,884 --> 01:57:38,884
Step out of the vehicle.

2161
01:57:38,886 --> 01:57:41,053
Hands in the air.

2162
01:57:41,055 --> 01:57:43,555
Keep 'em up.
Hold it there.

2163
01:57:45,659 --> 01:57:48,060
Turn around.
Turn around.

2164
01:57:48,062 --> 01:57:50,028
Fingers behind
your head.

2165
01:57:50,030 --> 01:57:52,731
Hold it right there.

2166
01:58:00,707 --> 01:58:02,441
Hey, that's Eazy.

2167
01:58:04,445 --> 01:58:08,246
What's up, E?
I didn't know that was you. All right.

2168
01:58:08,248 --> 01:58:10,482
Hey, what's up?
What's up, homey? Yo, what up?

2169
01:58:12,786 --> 01:58:14,352
Nah. Hold up.
Hold up.

2170
01:58:14,354 --> 01:58:17,022
Hey, hey. Hold up.
Relax, homey. We in a club.

2171
01:58:18,125 --> 01:58:20,358
Cube, I just heard
you was over here.

2172
01:58:30,804 --> 01:58:32,637
Yeah, I'm here.

2173
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:34,339
What you need?

2174
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:40,078
Everybody to calm the fuck down,
from the looks of it.

2175
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:41,980
I mean, I was just
in the neighborhood, man.

2176
01:58:41,982 --> 01:58:45,217
I came here with Bone Thugs.
I was just coming to say what's up.

2177
01:58:46,086 --> 01:58:47,652
What's up?

2178
01:58:48,322 --> 01:58:50,722
<i>I saw Boyz n the Hood.</i>

2179
01:58:50,724 --> 01:58:52,324
It was good.

2180
01:58:52,326 --> 01:58:55,560
You ain't called that shit
a after-school special?

2181
01:58:58,432 --> 01:59:02,067
I like after-school specials, Cube.
You know that.

2182
01:59:09,143 --> 01:59:11,143
What's up, man?

2183
01:59:11,145 --> 01:59:13,278
How you feel?
You good?

2184
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:14,846
Hell, yeah, nigga,
I'm good.

2185
01:59:14,848 --> 01:59:17,249
It's good to see you.
That's what I'm talkin' about, Eric.

2186
01:59:17,251 --> 01:59:20,519
It's good to see you right now.
Look at you!

2187
01:59:20,521 --> 01:59:23,355
Pull your fuckin' homies off me
then if it's good to see me.

2188
01:59:23,357 --> 01:59:26,791
You had niggas jump us.
Goddamn!

2189
01:59:26,793 --> 01:59:29,594
How you go from selling rocks
in the dope house...

2190
01:59:29,596 --> 01:59:32,197
to having dinner in the White House with the president?

2191
01:59:32,199 --> 01:59:34,533
They still trying to figure that shit out.

2192
01:59:36,170 --> 01:59:38,537
But, hey,
all publicity--

2193
01:59:38,539 --> 01:59:40,539
Is good publicity.

2194
01:59:40,541 --> 01:59:42,874
- You know it.
- You know that's right.

2195
01:59:42,876 --> 01:59:44,476
Man.

2196
01:59:44,478 --> 01:59:46,678
Look, man, I--

2197
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:49,781
I wish that dumb shit really would've
never popped off between us.

2198
01:59:49,783 --> 01:59:51,983
We shouldn't have dissed each other in the first place.

2199
01:59:51,985 --> 01:59:55,387
Making the fans choose between us?
That wasn't cool.

2200
01:59:56,490 --> 01:59:57,856
You right.

2201
01:59:59,726 --> 02:00:03,228
You ever think we'd be that big though?
Hell, no.

2202
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:05,130
I was just talking
to my wife about that--

2203
02:00:05,132 --> 02:00:06,998
how it was in the beginning.
Yeah.

2204
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,568
Shit, we just wanted to do music for the neighborhood.

2205
02:00:09,570 --> 02:00:11,503
Be ghetto stars.

2206
02:00:11,505 --> 02:00:15,373
But what if we had
the chance to find out...

2207
02:00:15,375 --> 02:00:17,075
how big we
could really be?

2208
02:00:17,077 --> 02:00:19,377
Come on, man,
you got my mind workin'.

2209
02:00:19,379 --> 02:00:21,980
I be thinking about that shit all the time.

2210
02:00:21,982 --> 02:00:25,183
If we could just take that shit back to '89.
We changed the world.

2211
02:00:25,185 --> 02:00:28,053
I hear you.
It was a simpler time, you know?

2212
02:00:28,055 --> 02:00:30,855
It was hard then.
But I've had days...

2213
02:00:30,857 --> 02:00:33,825
where I almost wish we was
gettin' arrested in Detroit again.

2214
02:00:33,827 --> 02:00:35,427
Shit. You know?

2215
02:00:35,429 --> 02:00:37,829
Shit ain't gotta stop there.

2216
02:00:37,831 --> 02:00:42,000
But if we go do this,
we gotta do it right.

2217
02:00:42,002 --> 02:00:44,703
And if Dre with it,
I'm with it.

2218
02:00:44,705 --> 02:00:47,872
But I don't know your relationship with dude.

2219
02:00:47,874 --> 02:00:51,443
But if you want me, Eric,
Jerry can't be there.

2220
02:00:55,949 --> 02:00:59,017
All right.

2221
02:00:59,019 --> 02:01:02,554
Hey, man.

2222
02:01:02,556 --> 02:01:04,456
Shit.
It's 'cause you ain't got them damn gloves on.

2223
02:01:04,458 --> 02:01:07,058
Man, whatever.

2224
02:01:07,060 --> 02:01:08,893
But I hear you.

2225
02:01:08,895 --> 02:01:10,528
Yeah?

2226
02:01:11,465 --> 02:01:14,299
You said it.
All right.

2227
02:01:14,301 --> 02:01:17,469
These invoices haven't been paid.

2228
02:01:17,471 --> 02:01:19,638
They're two
or three years outdated.

2229
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:22,474
These are canceled checks.
They all bounced.

2230
02:01:22,476 --> 02:01:24,943
And these are past due.

2231
02:01:24,945 --> 02:01:28,480
Jerry took advantage
of you.

2232
02:01:28,482 --> 02:01:33,084
I know it's a lot,
but you had to know the truth sometime.

2233
02:01:33,086 --> 02:01:34,686
Now you do.

2234
02:01:36,590 --> 02:01:40,358
You know, Dre and Cube
tried to warn me about this.

2235
02:01:41,728 --> 02:01:44,663
I've been fuckin' up
for a long time.

2236
02:01:48,835 --> 02:01:50,335
Don't. Don't.

2237
02:01:50,337 --> 02:01:52,470
A really long time.

2238
02:01:55,442 --> 02:01:57,809
Shit.

2239
02:02:15,629 --> 02:02:17,595
Hey, man.

2240
02:02:20,667 --> 02:02:22,600
Where you been?

2241
02:02:22,602 --> 02:02:24,936
I've been
calling you all day.

2242
02:02:26,373 --> 02:02:28,573
Sit down, Jerry.

2243
02:02:32,379 --> 02:02:35,213
What is this all about?
Uh, the groupie?

2244
02:02:35,215 --> 02:02:37,716
The executive assistant?

2245
02:02:39,019 --> 02:02:41,319
She even go
to college?

2246
02:02:41,321 --> 02:02:44,289
Man, you're so much fucking smarter than this.

2247
02:02:44,291 --> 02:02:45,857
Sit down, Jerry.

2248
02:03:06,680 --> 02:03:09,047
This ain't
about Tomica, Jerry.

2249
02:03:10,150 --> 02:03:11,850
This about you.

2250
02:03:11,852 --> 02:03:13,885
And you can stop acting like you
ain't never done nothin' wrong.

2251
02:03:13,887 --> 02:03:16,354
You know what, man?
I know that you're upset.

2252
02:03:16,356 --> 02:03:17,922
I understand.

2253
02:03:19,092 --> 02:03:20,825
But I'm asking you--

2254
02:03:20,827 --> 02:03:22,927
I'm advising you,
take a breath, okay?

2255
02:03:22,929 --> 02:03:24,896
I'm gonna look
at the paperwork, Eric.

2256
02:03:24,898 --> 02:03:28,600
It's fucked up.
You can stop giving me advice as of now.

2257
02:03:29,836 --> 02:03:31,436
Here's what's about to happen.

2258
02:03:31,438 --> 02:03:33,271
I'm gonna get N.W.A.
back together,

2259
02:03:33,273 --> 02:03:36,341
and you ain't gonna have nothin' to do with it this time.

2260
02:03:38,111 --> 02:03:40,412
How the fuck can you even
say something like that?

2261
02:03:40,414 --> 02:03:43,448
What the fuck is
going on with you, man?

2262
02:03:43,450 --> 02:03:45,550
I know
what's good for you.

2263
02:03:45,552 --> 02:03:47,619
I know what's good
for Ruthless.

2264
02:03:47,621 --> 02:03:51,222
And we have worked up a trust after years of hard work,

2265
02:03:51,224 --> 02:03:53,291
and that trust is our foundation, Eric.

2266
02:03:53,293 --> 02:03:55,427
I don't give a shit.
Eric.

2267
02:03:58,865 --> 02:04:02,100
You look lousy, man.
Are you okay?

2268
02:04:02,936 --> 02:04:04,536
Trust?

2269
02:04:05,472 --> 02:04:07,806
Trust is a motherfucker.

2270
02:04:08,975 --> 02:04:10,642
Is it?

2271
02:04:10,644 --> 02:04:13,311
Let me ask you
something.

2272
02:04:13,313 --> 02:04:15,914
Eric, if what I'm doing
is so illegal,

2273
02:04:15,916 --> 02:04:17,982
how come I've never
been sued, hmm?

2274
02:04:17,984 --> 02:04:21,753
If I'm such a fucking thief,
such a liar, such a motherfucker,

2275
02:04:21,755 --> 02:04:23,988
how come nobody's
ever come to collect?

2276
02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:27,792
Because this is business,
and this is how it works.

2277
02:04:27,794 --> 02:04:30,161
And it's not
always pretty. No.

2278
02:04:30,163 --> 02:04:34,232
Do I cover my own ass?
Do I cover my own end? Absolutely.

2279
02:04:34,234 --> 02:04:36,234
But don't you dare
fucking tell me...

2280
02:04:36,236 --> 02:04:38,269
that I have not
taken care of you.

2281
02:04:38,271 --> 02:04:39,838
Don't you
fucking tell me...

2282
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:42,841
that I have not had your back from day one!

2283
02:04:42,843 --> 02:04:44,709
Day one!

2284
02:04:49,015 --> 02:04:51,583
Is this taking care of me?

2285
02:04:51,585 --> 02:04:53,418
Are you fucking
kidding me?

2286
02:04:53,420 --> 02:04:55,286
It's taking care
of the whole fucking thing.

2287
02:04:55,288 --> 02:04:58,189
It's business!
And this is how it works.

2288
02:04:58,191 --> 02:05:01,993
Have I covered my end?
Do I cover my ass? Absolutely.

2289
02:05:01,995 --> 02:05:06,564
But don't you dare fucking tell me
that I have not taken care of you.

2290
02:05:08,034 --> 02:05:09,767
This business too?

2291
02:05:09,769 --> 02:05:11,369
Yes.
This is business.

2292
02:05:11,371 --> 02:05:12,971
This is how fucked up
it can get.

2293
02:05:12,973 --> 02:05:16,174
But I didn't start this.
I didn't fuck it up.

2294
02:05:16,176 --> 02:05:17,775
You did!

2295
02:05:19,212 --> 02:05:20,845
No.

2296
02:05:22,382 --> 02:05:24,182
You did.

2297
02:05:25,652 --> 02:05:27,318
You fired, Jerry.

2298
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:28,853
Oh, for Christ--

2299
02:05:28,855 --> 02:05:30,822
Eric, this isn't
how we do things.

2300
02:05:30,824 --> 02:05:34,792
This is not you.
This is not you. Eric!

2301
02:05:36,196 --> 02:05:37,829
This is
an important company.

2302
02:05:37,831 --> 02:05:40,798
Eric, I'm not gonna
let you fuck this up.

2303
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:42,634
Eric?

2304
02:05:42,636 --> 02:05:45,036
Oh, for Christ's sake, Eric!

2305
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:58,550
<i>Yeah, hello?</i>

2306
02:05:58,552 --> 02:06:00,418
Yeah, what up, Dre?

2307
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:02,353
<i>Who this?
Eric.</i>

2308
02:06:02,355 --> 02:06:05,323
<i>E?
Just felt like calling.</i>

2309
02:06:05,325 --> 02:06:08,259
<i>Yeah. Okay.</i>

2310
02:06:08,261 --> 02:06:09,928
What's up?

2311
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:12,664
<i>I mean, you know me, man.
Doing my thing.</i>

2312
02:06:12,666 --> 02:06:15,099
Killin' all this pussy.

2313
02:06:16,503 --> 02:06:18,102
<i>How about you?
You know, man.</i>

2314
02:06:18,104 --> 02:06:20,939
I'm just making tracks,
doing my thing.

2315
02:06:24,544 --> 02:06:26,344
Look, Dre,
I know you be busy,

2316
02:06:26,346 --> 02:06:31,583
but, um, I talked to Cube,
and we were talking about some--

2317
02:06:31,585 --> 02:06:33,117
some possibilities.

2318
02:06:34,554 --> 02:06:37,021
Possibilities?
Okay.

2319
02:06:37,023 --> 02:06:40,892
Yeah, like,
without Jerry Heller type of fucking possibilities.

2320
02:06:40,894 --> 02:06:43,261
Really?
Well, it's about time.

2321
02:06:43,263 --> 02:06:45,930
Man, I mean,
I know shit kinda went crazy.

2322
02:06:45,932 --> 02:06:47,799
And--

2323
02:06:47,801 --> 02:06:51,569
You know,
the money kinda had everybody divided, man,

2324
02:06:51,571 --> 02:06:55,006
but... I really
wish it didn't.

2325
02:06:59,546 --> 02:07:01,479
It's, uh--

2326
02:07:01,481 --> 02:07:05,550
To be honest, man,
I'm not proud of all the shit I did either.

2327
02:07:10,924 --> 02:07:14,292
So, what you think, man?
You think we could get together or what?

2328
02:07:14,294 --> 02:07:15,860
What you think?

2329
02:07:19,165 --> 02:07:20,999
Yeah, man.

2330
02:07:21,768 --> 02:07:23,735
Yeah, that sound good.

2331
02:07:24,838 --> 02:07:27,005
Let's do it, E.
Let's do it.

2332
02:07:27,007 --> 02:07:30,074
<i>I'm-a let you know when we can
get back into the studio, you know.</i>

2333
02:07:30,076 --> 02:07:33,044
Lay down some tracks,
like the old days.

2334
02:07:35,415 --> 02:07:37,949
<i>Fair enough.
All right.</i>

2335
02:07:37,951 --> 02:07:40,752
It's good to hear
from you, man.

2336
02:07:42,622 --> 02:07:44,222
All right.

2337
02:08:15,055 --> 02:08:17,522
<i>Man, y'all niggas ain't making no music in here.</i>

2338
02:08:17,524 --> 02:08:19,657
Hey!
What's up, E?

2339
02:08:19,659 --> 02:08:21,225
What's up? What up?
What up? What up?

2340
02:08:21,227 --> 02:08:24,362
Yo, hey, when are Dre and Cube
gonna roll up in here, man? I'm ready!

2341
02:08:24,364 --> 02:08:27,131
Yeah, man.
'Cause I'm ready to get this new shit going.

2342
02:08:27,133 --> 02:08:28,566
I'm ready too.

2343
02:08:28,568 --> 02:08:31,969
But long as we stay ready,
we gonna know we gonna be on, man.

2344
02:08:31,971 --> 02:08:34,739
Y'all already know this new
N.W.A. shit about to be crazy.

2345
02:08:34,741 --> 02:08:37,375
Here ya go, baby.
E, I got books of new shit.

2346
02:08:37,377 --> 02:08:40,178
I got libraries of new shit.
That's what I'm talking about, Ren.

2347
02:08:40,180 --> 02:08:41,979
That's what I'm talking about.

2348
02:08:41,981 --> 02:08:44,515
<i>¶¶ I got the tracks.
You like that?</i>

2349
02:08:44,517 --> 02:08:46,484
Mm-hmm.

2350
02:08:46,486 --> 02:08:48,252
Hell, yeah.

2351
02:08:48,254 --> 02:08:50,555
You think you Dre now?

2352
02:08:50,557 --> 02:08:52,423
I'm trying
to murder Dre.

2353
02:08:52,425 --> 02:08:55,727
I'm about to murder both of y'all on the track though.
Check me out.

2354
02:08:55,729 --> 02:08:57,595
Check me out.
What you doing, E?

2355
02:08:57,597 --> 02:08:59,831
You know you don't play
no instruments.

2356
02:09:03,169 --> 02:09:04,936
You gonna play it?

2357
02:09:07,207 --> 02:09:08,906
E, you all right?

2358
02:09:09,709 --> 02:09:11,175
Eric.

2359
02:09:12,278 --> 02:09:14,011
Baby, you good?

2360
02:09:15,115 --> 02:09:16,614
Yeah.

2361
02:09:16,616 --> 02:09:18,182
I'm all right.

2362
02:09:21,454 --> 02:09:23,020
Eric! Eric!

2363
02:09:23,022 --> 02:09:24,756
Call 911.
Eric!

2364
02:09:24,758 --> 02:09:26,891
Eric.
Get up, man. Baby?

2365
02:09:26,893 --> 02:09:28,893
Yo, call 911.
Call 911.

2366
02:09:28,895 --> 02:09:31,462
You all right, E?
Baby? Eric? Eric.

2367
02:09:31,464 --> 02:09:33,631
Eazy, wake up.
Eric, baby!

2368
02:09:33,633 --> 02:09:36,200
Open your eyes. Yes,
we need an ambulance.

2369
02:09:51,484 --> 02:09:55,119
Wait. Ain't you
gonna say something?

2370
02:09:55,121 --> 02:09:58,256
What is it? A respiratory infection?
Pneumonia? What?

2371
02:09:58,258 --> 02:10:02,460
Yes, well, um,
it is those things and more, I'm afraid.

2372
02:10:02,462 --> 02:10:04,495
We ran
a full blood battery.

2373
02:10:04,497 --> 02:10:07,165
And, uh--

2374
02:10:07,167 --> 02:10:11,736
I'm sorry, Mr. Wright, but, uh,
you've tested positive for HIV.

2375
02:10:13,339 --> 02:10:15,673
Get the fuck outta here.
Wha-Wha-What?

2376
02:10:15,675 --> 02:10:19,844
A normal T-cell count is
anywhere between 500 and 1500.

2377
02:10:19,846 --> 02:10:22,079
Right now,
your T-cell count is 14.

2378
02:10:26,820 --> 02:10:28,586
But I ain't no faggot.

2379
02:10:28,588 --> 02:10:32,356
Mr. Wright, actually, um,
the virus can be transmitted in quite a few ways,

2380
02:10:32,358 --> 02:10:35,493
including unprotected
heterosexual sex.

2381
02:10:39,699 --> 02:10:41,532
Uh--
That's wrong.

2382
02:10:41,534 --> 02:10:44,502
You-You gotta test that over.
That's-- Test that again.

2383
02:10:44,504 --> 02:10:47,305
We've run the test five times
with five different samples...

2384
02:10:47,307 --> 02:10:49,173
and the result remains the same.
Shit!

2385
02:10:49,175 --> 02:10:50,174
Tomica.

2386
02:10:52,345 --> 02:10:53,878
Tomica.

2387
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:56,981
But she's pregnant, Doc.
What this mean?

2388
02:10:56,983 --> 02:11:00,218
It doesn't necessarily mean
that she's contracted the virus.

2389
02:11:00,220 --> 02:11:03,154
But, uh, we have
to test her to be sure.

2390
02:11:03,156 --> 02:11:05,823
So, what do we do?
What-- When we start the treatment?

2391
02:11:05,825 --> 02:11:08,559
I mean, what--
I gotta get healthy.

2392
02:11:08,561 --> 02:11:12,063
I got things to do.
I got--

2393
02:11:12,065 --> 02:11:14,198
Wha-What are we supposed to do?

2394
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:15,900
Mr. Wright.

2395
02:11:15,902 --> 02:11:18,970
You need to understand
that you are very, very sick.

2396
02:11:18,972 --> 02:11:21,038
But I don't even feel
that bad, Doc.

2397
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:22,740
Don't tell me that.
Don't tell me that.

2398
02:11:22,742 --> 02:11:24,242
With care
and palliative care,

2399
02:11:24,244 --> 02:11:26,077
we can probably
keep you comfortable...

2400
02:11:26,079 --> 02:11:29,247
for, uh, maybe six months,
at the very most.

2401
02:11:29,249 --> 02:11:32,984
Comfortable?
What do you mean, comfortable?

2402
02:11:36,489 --> 02:11:38,155
It's just
a matter of time.

2403
02:11:40,059 --> 02:11:44,662
I am-- I'm truly,
truly sorry, Mr. Wright.

2404
02:11:44,664 --> 02:11:48,466
I'll-I'll leave you time to, um,
process this.

2405
02:11:50,937 --> 02:11:53,504
Come on, Doc.
Come on, Doc. No.

2406
02:11:53,506 --> 02:11:55,172
Doc.

2407
02:12:06,886 --> 02:12:08,953
Come on!

2408
02:12:13,793 --> 02:12:15,860
<i>And one of the pioneers
of gangster rap,</i>

2409
02:12:15,862 --> 02:12:19,297
<i>as the leader of the group N.W.A.
has revealed he has AIDS.</i>

2410
02:12:19,299 --> 02:12:20,965
<i>We were totally unprepared...</i>

2411
02:12:20,967 --> 02:12:24,135
<i>for the kind of outpouring
of fan calls that we had.</i>

2412
02:12:24,137 --> 02:12:26,938
<i>We had over 7,000 calls.</i>

2413
02:12:28,141 --> 02:12:31,642
It's, uh-- It's Bone Thugs's new LP, man.

2414
02:12:31,644 --> 02:12:35,246
Everybody thinks it's gonna be cool when it drop.

2415
02:12:35,248 --> 02:12:37,982
It's gonna be huge, man.
That's great.

2416
02:12:37,984 --> 02:12:41,752
Do you wanna hear it, man?
You-- You wanna hear it?

2417
02:12:41,754 --> 02:12:45,790
Nah, man. Just leave it here for me.
I'll check it out later.

2418
02:12:47,827 --> 02:12:50,227
This is bullshit,
man.

2419
02:12:56,502 --> 02:12:58,336
Hey, Yella,
why don't you check on him, man?

2420
02:12:58,338 --> 02:13:01,005
See if he all right.
All right?

2421
02:13:01,007 --> 02:13:03,541
I-- I'll call you
when I get out of here.

2422
02:13:06,279 --> 02:13:07,645
All right?

2423
02:13:32,705 --> 02:13:34,705
<i>What's his condition?
His condition--</i>

2424
02:13:34,707 --> 02:13:36,440
<i>He's in intensive care.</i>

2425
02:13:36,442 --> 02:13:39,610
<i>Uh, we're not certain
where-where it's headed.</i>

2426
02:14:08,074 --> 02:14:10,574
What's up, Eric?

2427
02:14:12,545 --> 02:14:14,145
It's Dre.

2428
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:21,419
Man, I've been-- I've been
makin' some dope new tracks.

2429
02:14:22,422 --> 02:14:25,723
This next N.W.A. album,
it's about to be dope.

2430
02:14:25,725 --> 02:14:28,759
It's about to be huge,
you know?

2431
02:14:32,265 --> 02:14:35,199
Hey, you remember
that time when, um,

2432
02:14:35,201 --> 02:14:37,668
when we was making
"Boyz-N-The-Hood"?

2433
02:14:41,574 --> 02:14:43,374
Your non-rappin' ass.

2434
02:14:43,376 --> 02:14:47,244
You was trippin' out, man, 'cause--

2435
02:15:09,469 --> 02:15:11,469
I love you, E.

2436
02:15:13,873 --> 02:15:16,173
You hear me?
I love you, man.

2437
02:15:21,614 --> 02:15:23,280
Dre.

2438
02:15:24,750 --> 02:15:26,350
Yo, Cube.

2439
02:15:29,122 --> 02:15:32,456
How is he doing? Can he--
Can he talk? Can he--

2440
02:15:32,458 --> 02:15:35,693
Nah, man.
He in a fuckin' coma.

2441
02:15:37,497 --> 02:15:40,764
Got the machines breathing for him and shit.

2442
02:15:40,766 --> 02:15:42,566
He ain't even conscious.

2443
02:15:44,971 --> 02:15:47,638
I need to hear
his voice, Dre.

2444
02:15:48,508 --> 02:15:51,375
I can't see him
laid up like that.

2445
02:15:52,678 --> 02:15:54,645
I wanna talk to him.

2446
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:57,815
I want him to talk to me.

2447
02:15:59,485 --> 02:16:01,585
I feel that.

2448
02:16:04,757 --> 02:16:06,557
It's all right, man.

2449
02:16:09,362 --> 02:16:11,762
It's good to see you, man.
You too.

2450
02:16:15,334 --> 02:16:16,734
Peace.

<i>Wright was 31.</i>

2458
02:16:50,236 --> 02:16:52,403
<i>Eazy wrote me a personal letter...</i>

2459
02:16:52,405 --> 02:16:55,839
<i>to read to each and every one
of his fans and loved ones.</i>

2460
02:16:55,841 --> 02:16:59,410
<i>"I just feel that I've got thousands
and thousands of young fans...</i>

2461
02:16:59,412 --> 02:17:02,680
<i>that have to learn about what's
real when it comes to AIDS.</i>

2462
02:17:02,682 --> 02:17:06,317
<i>I would like to turn my own
problem into something good...</i>

2463

2464

<i>Much love to those

2465
02:17:13,926 --> 02:17:16,427
<i>and thanks
for your support."</i>

2466
02:17:28,441 --> 02:17:31,242
Pac is in the studio
writing every day.

2467
02:17:31,244 --> 02:17:34,111
Snoop is doing his thing.
What y'all doing?

2468
02:17:34,113 --> 02:17:35,746
Y'all niggas gettin'
too comfortable.

2469
02:17:35,748 --> 02:17:37,781
Handle this shit.
You know what I'm say-- Suge.

2470
02:17:40,119 --> 02:17:42,019
What's the urgency, Dre?

2471
02:17:42,021 --> 02:17:43,621
Plotz.

2472
02:17:43,623 --> 02:17:46,757
I'm out.
I'm out of Death Row.

2473
02:17:48,294 --> 02:17:50,227
You ain't done.

2474
02:17:50,229 --> 02:17:52,963
Dr. Dre and Death Row are one and the same.
You just can't up and leave.

2475
02:17:52,965 --> 02:17:54,932
I'm doing
my own thing, Suge.

2476
02:17:54,934 --> 02:17:56,634
I'm starting fresh.

2477
02:17:56,636 --> 02:17:59,803
Nobody to answer to
but myself.

2478
02:17:59,805 --> 02:18:02,740
It's time.
You one stupid motherfucker.

2479
02:18:02,742 --> 02:18:04,908
You gonna walk away
from all this money?

2480
02:18:04,910 --> 02:18:08,145
If you leave,
everything we created is mine.

2481
02:18:08,147 --> 02:18:09,913
"We"?

2482
02:18:09,915 --> 02:18:12,249
Okay.
Well, you know what?

2483
02:18:12,251 --> 02:18:14,218
You can have it.

2484
02:18:15,388 --> 02:18:17,421
You ain't taking
nobody with you.

2485
02:18:17,423 --> 02:18:19,590
Death Row stays Death Row.

2486
02:18:19,592 --> 02:18:22,760
And you even think
about touching my money--

2487
02:18:22,762 --> 02:18:25,162
Motherfucker, you know
how I gets down.

2488
02:18:25,164 --> 02:18:26,764
Do what the fuck
you gotta do.

2489
02:18:26,766 --> 02:18:30,434
You can have the artists,
the money, the masters,

2490
02:18:30,436 --> 02:18:32,002
all your
fuckin' bullshit.

2491
02:18:32,004 --> 02:18:33,570
I'm done.

2492
02:18:34,607 --> 02:18:36,774
I'm starting
my own thing.

2493
02:18:36,776 --> 02:18:39,877
You can't put a price
on peace of mind.

2494
02:18:41,747 --> 02:18:43,414
I'm out.

2495
02:18:47,987 --> 02:18:51,488
I got all this nigga's money.
I got everything.

2496
02:18:52,358 --> 02:18:54,692
Get the fuck out. Go.

2497
02:18:58,764 --> 02:19:01,432
So, what you gonna
call that bullshit?

2498
02:19:05,171 --> 02:19:06,737
Aftermath.

2499
02:19:10,976 --> 02:19:14,511
<i>You are now about to witness
the strength of street knowledge.</i>

2500
02:19:19,051 --> 02:19:21,485
It's just, like, they try
to hide what's goin' on,

2501
02:19:21,487 --> 02:19:23,287
and we tell it like
it is, you know?

2502
02:19:23,289 --> 02:19:24,722
<i>¶ Straight outta Compton ¶</i>

2503
02:19:24,724 --> 02:19:26,056

<i>¶ From the gang

2505
02:19:28,361 --> 02:19:30,127
You know
it's gotta be hard.

2506
02:19:30,129 --> 02:19:33,230
<i>'Cause if it ain't hard,
it's weak.</i>

2507
02:19:33,232 --> 02:19:35,666
<i>¶ You too, boy,

2508
02:19:35,668 --> 02:19:37,801
<i>¶ The police are gonna
have to come and get me ¶</i>

2509
02:19:37,803 --> 02:19:39,737
MC Ren in the house.
When you making a record,

2510
02:19:39,739 --> 02:19:41,872
you gotta have some hype lyrics,
and you got that, it's gonna sell.

2511
02:19:41,874 --> 02:19:44,675
<i>¶ Straight outta Compton
Another crazy-ass nigga ¶</i>

2512
02:19:44,677 --> 02:19:47,077
<i>¶ More punks I smoke, yo,
my rep gets bigger ¶</i>

2513
02:19:47,079 --> 02:19:50,247
Eazy-E probably was one of the nicest
people you ever would have known.

2514
02:19:50,249 --> 02:19:51,715
Not as Eazy,
but as Eric Wright.

2515
02:19:51,717 --> 02:19:53,917
<i>¶ But I don't gave a fuck
I'm gonna make my snaps ¶</i>

2516
02:19:53,919 --> 02:19:56,987
<i>¶ If not from the records,
from jackin' the crops Just like burglary ¶</i>

2517
02:19:56,989 --> 02:20:00,758
<i>We make our records based on
stuff that's happening where we live.</i>

2518
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:05,095
And if people out there
that don't like it, fuck 'em.

<i>¶ Is a brother that'll
smother your mother ¶</i>

2521
02:20:08,601 --> 02:20:12,770
Dre and Eazy had already been selling it
as cassette tapes. And they just blew up.

2522
02:20:12,772 --> 02:20:15,439
Eazy and Dr. Dre
Wild & Wet Pool Party.

2523
02:20:15,441 --> 02:20:17,708
This is what
it's all about!

2524
02:20:17,710 --> 02:20:19,710
"We wanted to invite you
to the president's luncheon."

2525
02:20:19,712 --> 02:20:21,879
I said if I go down there,
this'll start some shit.

2526
02:20:21,881 --> 02:20:24,615
<i>¶ To me it's kinda funny The
attitude showin' a nigga drivin' ¶</i>

2527
02:20:24,617 --> 02:20:27,684
<i>When I think of N.W.A.,
they weren't really music to me.</i>

2528
02:20:27,686 --> 02:20:29,620
<i>It was more
like a real lifestyle.</i>

2529
02:20:29,622 --> 02:20:31,388
<i>Brothers from my neighborhood
made it out.</i>

<i>¶ Mix 'em and cook 'em
in a pot like gumbo ¶</i>

02:20:36,529 --> 02:20:38,796
You got the dopest album out this year.
Thanks, man.

2533
02:20:38,798 --> 02:20:41,231
<i>More than happy to get my
career going like I want it to go.</i>

2534
02:20:41,233 --> 02:20:42,933
Damn!

<i>¶ Ain't no tellin' when I'm down for a jack move ¶</i>

<i>¶ AK-47 is the tool ¶</i>

2537
02:20:47,706 --> 02:20:49,907
You do not know how long I waited to get in his booth...

2538
02:20:49,909 --> 02:20:52,643
and to have Dre out there
goin', "You ready?"

2539
02:20:52,645 --> 02:20:54,978
<i>I waited all my life for that,
since Straight Outta Compton.</i>

2540
02:20:54,980 --> 02:20:59,583
Dre's direction was helping me become a strong lyricist,
which I am now.

2541
02:20:59,585 --> 02:21:02,319
<i>¶ That I'm down

<i>but business-wise,
you know what I'm sayin'?</i>

2545
02:21:09,094 --> 02:21:11,962
You'd have to even credit both
Eminem's and my success to Dr. Dre.

2546
02:21:13,499 --> 02:21:18,335
<i>Apple's purchase of Beats will
be the biggest deal in its history.</i>

enemies in the quest of victory ¶</i>

2562

that part of my history ¶</i>

2564

<i>¶ And I'm strong
financially, physically ¶</i>

2565

<i>¶ Mentally I'm
on a whole nother level ¶</i>

2566
02:22:30,209 --> 02:22:32,976
<i>¶ And don't forget
that I came from the ghetto ¶</i>

2567
02:22:32,978 --> 02:22:35,412
