00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:22,761
[Zadie] The impulse to dance
existed long before

3
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:25,329
our primate ancestors
evolved into humans.

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,897
Evolutionary biologists
suggest that dance

5
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,246
was used by early humans

6
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:30,900
to promote
the social cooperation

7
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,945
essential for our survival.

8
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,512
Indeed, studies have found that

9
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:36,340
today's best dancers all share

10
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:38,386
the two specific genes
associated

11
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:40,475
with excellent
interpersonal skills.

12
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:43,521
But despite its power
to save our species,

13
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:45,045
dance could not save

00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,770
Maybe. Do you have music?

177
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:34,731

finish your drink.

182
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:51,618
So, I don't know if you
really know what you bought...

183
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:55,970
But I'm gonna give it
to you anyway.

184
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,668
And at any point I take you
past your comfort zone...

185
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,540
I fucking slap you.

186
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,804
You can slap me.
That's perfect.

187
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:06,328
May I touch you?

188
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,549
I guess.

You don't know what I said.

What are you talking about?
Yeah, I do.

195
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:48,740
What did I say?

196
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,612
You said I move like water.

197
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,836
I didn't mean for you to
understand that.

198
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:59,360
Well, maybe you should be

199
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,927
a little more careful
what you say.

200

was going to be like...

mattered anyway,

I'm not even gonna take
the six grand. [Kisses]

What's in London?

212
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:52,456
My life.

213
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:55,633
Your life's in London?
I thought this was your house.

214
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:59,028
This is a house,
but it's not the house.

215

Max, I can't just go to London.

216

I got, like,
stuff here. I got...

217
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:07,819
Like there's a whole mess.
I got a job.

I can't just go to London.

No, well, I have a job
for you in mind.

It's creative.
And all you have to do

223
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:21,355
is come with me for a month

224
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:24,967
and I will give you
your 60 thousand.

225

Max, I can't just up and leave
my entire life here for you...

Not for a mon... I can't.
Not for a whole month.

228
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:33,976
You should come with me

229
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:36,388
and then if it's out of your
comfort zone then you just...

230

- I get to fucking slap you?
- You can fucking slap me.

231

Thank you.

[Chuckles] I don't really
fuck with vegetables.

235

I don't know. Genetics.

- Genetics, I guess.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah?

239
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:15,713
No, Roger's family is in media.

240
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:18,673
Oh, that's cool.
Is that like TV and shit?

241
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:21,328
It's more like
everything and shit.

242
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,156
Right.

243
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:26,855
So, um, I don't know.
What happened, with that?

244
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,380
Marriage happened.

245
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:32,339
[Mike] Mmm.

246
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:34,167
Are you married?

247
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:38,780
Am I married? Um, would it
be a problem if I was?

248
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,914
No. This is
100 percent business.

249
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:46,135
Right. You keep talking
about this "job."

250
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,485
But you always leave out
what the actual job is.

251
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:51,227
It's what you were meant
to be doing all along.

252
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:55,057
Okay. I've made it
really clear though,

253
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:57,146
I'm not... I don't dance anymore.

254
00:16:57,277 --> 00:17:00,889
Then I can claim that I got
magic Mike's last dance.

[Chuckles]

256
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:06,025
So what else could you
possibly be paying me for?

257
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,377
We are not having sex.

258
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,161
Completely out of the question.

259
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:15,121

00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:17,079
You know, Mike,
I actually think you have...

261
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:21,649
Other talents. And this is
what I'm invested in.

262
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,912
Okay. But just, you know,
hear me out.

263
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:30,527
You've purchased me for
a month, um, let's just say...

264
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:33,008
You say, "jump."
I say, "which bed?"

265
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,141

266
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:40,624
Kind of magical.
It was amazing.

268
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,066
Okay?

269
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,242
Okay.

I'm not, by the way.

in a relationship?

to, uh, work out.

Now, sir, the brown hamper
is for dry cleaning

any dry cleaning and I,
by the way

never allow that, sir.

is through this door here.

even if you did know, would you?

296

if I said I wasn't lying, sir.

to give credit to Victor

305

because he becomes unbearable...

306
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:07,510
But I wouldn't own the place
that we're going to

307
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:09,077

310

was a sand and gravel pit
in high wycombe.

311
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:20,393
And the only value I saw in it
was that my mother-in-law...

312

Didn't want to give it away.

313
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:25,354
But now,
I have found its purpose.

314
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,229
What's my purpose there?
If we're going there.

315

[Chuckles] Okay.

319

As a matter of fact, Victor,

320
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:43,938
I think we should stop
at Liberty's first.

Don't you think?

322
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,854
I would let harj know,

323

341
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,079

opened in 2004,

the owner of the theater

343
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:43,302
fell madly in love with this
horribly insecure actress.

it's going to end.

look the part.

351
00:22:05,236 --> 00:22:08,196
So relax, have fun

352
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,851
and I promise there won't be
any more surprises,

353
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:12,176
but you're gonna like this one.

354
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
You swear?

355
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:14,376
[Footsteps approaching]

356
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:15,812
Deal.

357
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:18,032
Miss mendoza!
Right on time as usual.

358
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:19,860
Stop it, Woody.
I'm half an hour late.

359
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,644
As usual. Is this, uh...

360
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:23,211
Yeah, Mike, meet Woody,

361
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,082
the best stage manager
in all of London.

362
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:27,694
Easy. I'm just here to serve
your vision, gov.

363
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:30,566
My vision?

364
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:34,396
Mm-hmm. Your vision. Let's go.

365
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,312
Oh, fuck.

366
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:38,681
[Director and actors
talking indistinctly]

367
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:39,793
Voilà.

368
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:41,577
Wow.

369
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:42,883
Right on time.

370
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:51,195
[Matthew] Listen, I... Hugh,

371
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:54,373
are we actually going again
because I'm not sure.

372
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:55,872
But if you go back
to the start of the scene

373
00:22:55,896 --> 00:22:57,177
please just go
to the top of the scene

374
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:58,483
and imbue it
with a little more...

375
00:22:58,507 --> 00:22:59,615
[Mike] So what's this
shit about?

376
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:01,031
It's the same old

377
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:03,164
will-she-marry-for-love
or-money bullshit.

378
00:23:03,294 --> 00:23:05,079
Hmm.

379
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:07,081
So, what does she pick?
Love or money?

380
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:08,691
Who cares?

381
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:10,693
The real question is:

382
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:12,521
Why does she feel like
she has to choose?

383
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,107
[Matthew] I think
I've run out of words.

384
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:15,394
Hell yeah.

385
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:16,804
Well, this is your joint, right?

386
00:23:16,917 --> 00:23:18,285
Why don't you just
give them that note?

387
00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:19,374
[Isabel ascendant actor]
Show me,

388
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,703
have you got the script or...

389
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,394
[Matthew] Jessica,
do you have a script?

390
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,728
[Isabel ascendant director]
Oh, this is a jolly good

391
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:26,840
waste of time, isn't it?

392
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,798
Bravo! [Clapping]
Bravo, everybody.

393
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,322
Absolutely flawless, thank you.

394
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,976
Excuse me?
Who the fuck is talking?

395
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:36,153
Oh. Maxandra.
My sincere apologies.

396
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:38,155
I couldn't see you in the light.

397
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:40,157
Nice to see you again, uh...

398
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,204
- Matthew.
- Right.

399
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:45,641
- The director.
- Of course.

400
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:47,382
To what do we owe the pleasure?

401
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:48,905
I'm here to make
an announcement.

402
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:51,604
Oh! Oh. Tell me.

403
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:53,083
Well, if I only told you

404
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:55,303
it wouldn't be
an announcement, would it?

405
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,349
I suppose not.
Um, attention, everyone!

406
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,613
Gang, this is maxandra rattigan.

407
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:02,136
The wife of our owner and...

408
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:05,444
Actually, it's maxandra mendoza

409
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:07,924
and I'm the legal owner
of this theater.

410
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:13,321
I am here to give you all notice

411
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,802
Isabel ascendant is closed...

412
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,326
Effective immediately.

413
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,545
On what fucking grounds?

414
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:21,198
We are at capacity every night!

415
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:25,638
Relax. It's only a four-week
course correction.

416
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:30,120
An evolution. A revelation!

417
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:31,644
[Slight chuckle]

418
00:24:31,774 --> 00:24:34,168
And no one is fired.

419
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:35,561
[Sighs] Christ.

420
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:37,476
Except for, um...

421
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:41,784
- Matthew.
- Matthew. Yes.

422
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:44,221
Matthew will be replaced

423
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:46,920
by a brilliant new choreographer

424
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:50,184
that I recently
discovered in Miami.

425
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:53,274
His artistry made me feel, uh...

426
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:59,193
[Slight chuckle] There are
no words. It's just...

427
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:01,064
Ecstasy.

428
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:04,111
And in exactly one month,

429
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:08,463
I want every woman that
walks into this theater

430
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:11,814
to feel the same kind
of ecstasy that I did.

431
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:16,471
To transcend. To break free.

432
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:18,342
So, without further ado...

433
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:22,259
I give you
the visionary artist...

434
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,133
That inspired me so profoundly

435
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:29,049
and that will take us
to the promised land.

436
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:31,225
Ladies and gentlemen...

437
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:33,706
Michael Jeffrey Lane.

438
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,925
[Applause]

439
00:25:43,063 --> 00:25:44,586
'Sup?

440
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:48,503
[Max] The look on Roger's face
when he sees this!

441
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:51,419
It's worth every pound,
every shilling.

442
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,744
No. Yeah.
You could've given me

443
00:25:52,768 --> 00:25:54,291
just a little heads-up before

444
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:55,822
you threw me
to the wolves in there!

445
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:57,120
You would've been in your head,

446
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:58,469
over-thinking everything.

447
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,795
It was better than not thinking

448
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:00,907
anything at all. Like...

449
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:02,648
And what are you
so excited about?

450
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,234
Like every single person
in there quit!

451
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:07,130
We don't need actors,
we need dancers.

452
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:09,176
Plus, by not firing them,

453
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:11,613
we saved thousands
on labor-union fees.

454
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:13,876
- [Mike laughs]
- More money for you.

455
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:17,488
Yeah, but... okay. I...
Look, no offense...

456
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:18,925
But there's got to be
easier ways

457
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:20,666
to get back
at your husband for...

458
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:23,016
I don't know, whatever,
than putting on a strip show.

459
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:26,802
Oh, I'm not a scorned woman,
and this is not a strip show.

460
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:29,239
We are bringing
the Tsunami to London!

461
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,198
[Chuckles] Okay.
All right. This...

462
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:32,416
And I'm down for that.

463
00:26:32,547 --> 00:26:33,698
I just think that you haven't...

464
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:35,202
Can't you see?
People are numb,

465
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:37,552
disconnected, desensitized.

466
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:39,641
We're going to wake them up

467
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:43,036
with a wave of passion
they've never felt before.

468
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,778
Okay, I just...
There's one little thing

469
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:47,344
that I think you're forgetting

470
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:49,608
is that I don't know shit
about directing theater.

471
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:51,435
- And that's why you have me!
- What?

472
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:53,176
It will be a historical,

473
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:56,702
one-night collaboration
between the stage, and the...

474
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:58,660
- The thongs?
- Eh, I don't know.

475
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,749
- Exactly. That's what...
- Who the hell are you?

476
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,185
I don't know. Who are you?

477
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:04,623
Zadie, what are you doing here?

478
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:06,537
Um, this is my daughter, zadie.

479
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,497
Oh, shit. Hi.
Nice to meet you!

480
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,978
- We had a meeting, maxandra.
- Yeah.

481
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:14,633
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.

482
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:16,765
I completely lost track of time.

483
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,811
Completely. I'm so sorry.

484
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:20,334
I can see that.
I'm more interested

485
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:22,815
in why you lost track of time.

486
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:25,992
Well, um, I've been
handling some business

487
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:28,037
with the new director
of Isabel ascendant.

488
00:27:28,168 --> 00:27:29,711
- [Mike] Mm-hmm.
- Michael Jeffrey Lane.

489
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:32,433
Ah, yeah. That's not my name.
But... it's just...

490
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:33,652
But it's got gravitas.

491
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:35,218
Yeah, it's just...
It's Mike Lane.

492
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:36,509
But you do need a stage name.

493
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,744
- Are you two hooking up?
- Zadie!

494
00:27:38,874 --> 00:27:40,460
Well, I... what's funny
about that is, uh...

495
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:42,530
Your mom actually
is paying me to not hook up.

496
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,359
We are not hooking up.

497
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:48,057
But he will be
staying at the house

498
00:27:48,188 --> 00:27:50,146
just until he gets settled.
Okay?

499
00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:51,844
How convenient.

500
00:27:51,974 --> 00:27:53,909
Tell me, Mike, what do you
plan to do with act three?

501
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:56,762
Yeah, we're gonna have one.

502
00:27:56,892 --> 00:28:00,766
I was pl... I was, uh, planning
on doing act three like a...

503
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,289
Everybody knows

504
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:04,030
Isabel ascendant
has a wildly outdated,

505
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,224
painfully misogynistic climax.

506
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,336
[Mike] Mm-hmm.

507
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,512
Exactly.
And that's why our take

508
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,340
is going to be so exciting

509
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:11,864
because they will be
expecting that

510
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:13,692
and instead, they're gonna see

511
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:15,017
that a woman can have
whatever she wants,

512
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:16,869
- whenever she wants it.
- Mm-hmm.

513
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:19,132
Since when do you believe that?

514
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:21,177
Since Mike and I have
been exploring this theme.

515
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:25,965
Yeah, your m... yeah, we've
been exploring those themes.

516
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:29,011
You're in another one
of your phases, aren't you?

517
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:32,623
Baby, don't you have some
schoolwork to do?

518
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:35,017
Uh, what's the phases thing?

519
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:37,628
Every few years
she starts a big new project.

520
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,935
Sometimes it's a charity,
a documentary,

521
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:41,763
- a new best friend.
- Right.

522
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:44,070
Each time it's like
she's a new person.

523
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,462
So what?

524
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:47,464
Sue me for exploring myself

525
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:50,467
and my contributions
to the world!

526
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:52,687
But your contributions
never see the light of day.

527
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:54,428
There's always some obstacle.

528
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,078
We call her
the queen of the first act.

529
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:58,084
Our therapist,
whom she stood up to be here,

530
00:28:58,214 --> 00:28:59,781
says she tries on these new

531
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:02,032
personas as a way from running
from the guilt about...

532
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:03,611
I already said how sorry I am

533
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,942
about missing that appointment

534
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:07,223
and I am going to reschedule it.

535
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:08,921

536
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,277
[Speaking French]

537
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:23,587
[Speaking French]

538
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:27,896
[Speaking French]

539
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:30,116
Uh, you know, pardon my French,

540
00:29:30,246 --> 00:29:32,858
but, uh, y'all are being
rude as fuck. [Chuckles]

541
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:33,989
Sorry.

542
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,253
[Speaking French]

543
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:40,387
- Pleasure, zadie.
- Zadie, wait, don't go.

544
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:43,129
You want some cake? Baby.

545
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:48,438
What's going on?

546
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,837
[Roger] No, I didn't know
until you sent it.

547
00:29:55,968 --> 00:29:57,708
Well, technically,
she does have the right.

548
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,713
I have no idea.
Maybe zadie will tell me.

549
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,456
Change the agreement how?

550
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,895
Mother... mother, I think

551
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:12,114
you should pursue this
on your own.

552
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:13,899
I can't get dragged
into a fight.

553
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:15,639
Not about this, not right now.

554
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:17,903
[Mike] Yo!

555
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:21,210
[Tito] Holy shit! Naysayers,
we have proof of life!

556
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:22,777
All right.

557
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:25,519
What's up, man?
I know, look, I know. I-I...

558
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:28,043
And I'm sorry, okay, I know
I've been ducking you all.

559
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:29,958
Uh, I apologize. I just...

560
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:32,178
It's a long story,
but I'm in London

561
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:33,588
and I just want you guys to know

562
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:34,934
I'm gonna be able
to pay you back,

563
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:36,443
I just need a few weeks. Okay?

564
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:37,836
Oh, come on, man!

565
00:30:37,966 --> 00:30:39,533
How many times
do we have to tell you

566
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:42,666
you don't need to pay us back!
It was an investment.

567
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:44,016
I know. I know. But i'm...

568
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:45,506
As many times
as you guys say that,

569
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:46,733
I'm not just gonna burn
my friends' money

570
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:48,281
and not care. All right?
I don't...

571
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:51,980
No. Money is water, Mike.
It flows in both directions.

572
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:53,939
That's a good point, but still.

573
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:57,594
You... yeah, hold up.
You buried the lede here.

574
00:30:57,725 --> 00:31:00,032
Why are you in London?

575
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:03,339
I don't know, short story
is that... [chuckles]

576
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:07,256
I was bartending at, uh,
this charity event

577
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:08,736
and then at the end of the night

578
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,825
I ended up giving
this rich lady a lap dance

579
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:12,566
and now I'm living
in her house in London

580
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:14,046
and gonna put on a show

581
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,483
at this famous theater
that she owns. So, yeah.

582
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:18,702
Cool. Hey, sex work

583
00:31:18,833 --> 00:31:20,704
is nothing to be
embarrassed about, Mikey.

584
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:22,924
Especially when
it's the live-in kind.

585
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:25,405
Hey, look, thanks, Tarzan.

586
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:26,773
Look, I basically am just saying

587
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:28,036
though I'm gonna
have your money...

588
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,975
I don't exactly know, uh,

589
00:31:30,105 --> 00:31:32,542
what I said yes to
so I hope it works out.

590
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:35,197
Mikey, Mikey,
this is great news.

591
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:37,330
I was looking
at your chart last night...

592
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,592
You know you're in a once-

593
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:41,769
in-33-year Jupiter cycle, right?

594
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,947
I... no, I didn't, but that
explains a lot I guess. Yeah.

595
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:48,907
Yeah, it does, so whatever
existential confusion

596
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:50,038
you're feeling right now,

597
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:51,822
it's an initiation.

598
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:55,087
It's wiping the slate clean
for you to self-actualize.

599
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:58,742
Uh, I'm just trying
to survive to be honest.

600
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:01,397
Surviving?
Bro, you are a gig worker.

601
00:32:01,528 --> 00:32:03,747
Magic Mike's coming back
to the main stage.

602
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:05,682
I... but that's the thing
I'm not even dancing though.

603
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:06,925
I'm putting on the show.

604
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:08,927
I guess I'm directing
or whatever.

605
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:10,929
I mean, it's...
I'm only here for a month,

606
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,582
it's for one show only,

607
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:15,237
to basically get back
at her ex or something.

608
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:17,631
I don't know. It's totally
bonkers over here.

609
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:19,850
Who gives a shit, man?
She's rich.

610
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:24,377
Trust me. Do not leave
that situation. Okay?

611
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:26,553
Look at me,
I'm basically a freaking

612
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:28,555
glorified dog Walker. Okay?

613
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:31,253
You just need to make sure
she doesn't wake up,

614
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:32,689
and all of a sudden

615
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,300
want you out of the house,

616
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,912
which I have tips on
by the way if you want them.

617
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:40,436
Okay. I-I...
We don't have dogs here

618
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:42,047
so maybe that's a good idea.

619
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:45,746
I feel it. I feel it
in my solar plexus, brother.

620
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:48,009
This is your Dharma.

621
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,403
- Just stay in the flow.
- Victor?

622
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,013
What are you doing there?

623
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:54,668
Oh, you know, waiting
for passing fucking trade.

624
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:56,975
He's on a private call.

625
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:59,151
Since when has that stopped you?

626
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:00,891
Oh, boys, I miss you.

627
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,154
[Mike chuckles]

628
00:33:02,284 --> 00:33:03,938
- Are you decent?
- Yep.

629
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,070
Is that her?

630
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,636
Are we interrupting something?

631
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:09,596
No, I was just, uh,
looking for some ideas.

632
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:12,729
Oh, I've been "scouting" myself.

633
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,341
And come take a look at
what I found.

634
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:16,907
[Mike chuckles]

635
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:18,059
["The journey" by Jack rayner
plays on computer]

636
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,083
Look at that.

637
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,049
Isn't he magnificent?

638
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,180
[Mike] Hmm.

639
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:34,403
He has such an innate
elegance and intelligence

640
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:36,275
to the way he moves.

641
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:37,711
And then at the same time

642
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:40,496
there's this savage thing,
you know...

643
00:33:40,627 --> 00:33:43,499
Like a primal animal.

644
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,025
[Sighs] Just incredible.

645
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,201
I think this is what we need
for the show.

646
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:51,551
Trained dancers, not strippers.

647
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:55,555
Yeah, but, I mean,
as the director,

648
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:57,992
i-i-i promise you...

649
00:33:58,123 --> 00:33:59,994
I know exactly what
we're looking for. Yeah.

650
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:04,868
I love the way
you just did that.

651
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:05,999
[Chuckles] What?

652
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:07,306
"As the director."

653
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:12,006
You're really owning
that place. You know?

654
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:14,356
[Slight chuckle]
It comes to you so naturally.

655
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:15,879
Mm-hmm.

656
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,795
I can tell that you already
have a vision.

657
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:22,669
And I'm sure that you agree
that this would be fantastic.

658
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:24,801
- [Mike] Yeah, he's great.
- For the show, I mean.

659
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:26,214
[Mike] Yeah. Yeah, really.
I mean, he's...

660
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:28,544
[Max] Antonio is what we need.

661
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:30,242
Uh, he's great. Like I said,

662
00:34:30,372 --> 00:34:32,940
he's just...
But he's also in Italy.

663
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,290
- Roma.
- Roma, see, I can't...

664
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:37,336
I don't have time
to go find him in roma

665
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:38,965
and then bring him
all the way back here.

666
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:40,817
Oh, no. That would be
out of the question.

667
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:43,385
But that's why you have
a genius producer!

668
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,736
He's arriving on Thursday.

669
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:49,609
If you approve.
Creatively, I mean.

670
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:57,051
Yeah, look, if you want him,
um, sure. I-I-I approve.

671
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:58,182
Creatively, of course.

672
00:34:58,226 --> 00:34:59,749
I'm so excited!

673
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,361
Are you excited?

674
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:05,015
Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I am.

675
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,453
You don't sound excited.

676
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,411
I'm very, very, very excited.
I promise.

677
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:10,847
Oh, man, me, I don't even think

678
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:12,501
I am gonna be able to sleep.

679
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:14,154
No?

680
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:22,250
Good night.

681
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:26,559
Sweet dreams.

682
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:27,689
Okay.

683
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:31,694
Wait, wait,
where are you going? Hey.

684
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:33,870
To bed?

685
00:35:34,001 --> 00:35:35,916
We got like 10
other dancers to find.

686
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:39,528
And that's why we have Renata.
Good night.

689
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:52,280
I've assembled
the top-tier of talent

690
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:54,978
across multiple
movement disciplines.

691
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:58,765
And they're all
very eager to please...

692
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:02,595
And quite athletic,
as you requested.

693
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:05,554
Excellent work as usual, Renata.

00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,276
some kind of strange rubicon.

700
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:27,626
She was desperate to know

701
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:29,454
more about
why she felt this way,

702
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:33,719
so she purchased a litany of
books on the history of dance.

703
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:37,070
For Mike, the rattigan
had no symbolic weight,

704
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,029
it was simply
where he had to work.

705
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,988
And he reminded himself,

706
00:39:42,118 --> 00:39:45,339
in order to finish something,
you have to make a start.

707
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,951
For maxandra, the rattigan
had been transformed.

708
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:51,954
It went from existing
only in the past

709
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,043
to being a source of renewal.

710
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:56,481
- [Max] Hello, hello, hello.
- Hey! Hey!

711
00:39:56,611 --> 00:39:59,484
Are you ready to transform
theater forever?

712
00:39:59,614 --> 00:40:00,615
[Yells of agreement]

713
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:01,834
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

714
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,447
[Mike] All right.
Calm down, calm down.

715
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:08,101
We ain't done shit yet.

716
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:10,625
All right, you guys have
all the talent in the world.

717
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:12,105
Ain't no questioning that.

718
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:13,628
Each and every
single person here

719
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:15,127
was hand selected
because they bring

720
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:16,326
something unique to the table

721
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:17,737
that we ain't never seen before.

722
00:40:18,198 --> 00:40:19,591
All right?

723
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:21,419
But I have a question for you.

724
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:22,898
Who here, by show of hands

725
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:24,509
has stood in front
of a thousand women

726
00:40:24,552 --> 00:40:25,752
and had to get butt-ass naked?

727
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,733
Exactly.

728
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:33,256
You want to find out how fast

729
00:40:33,387 --> 00:40:35,520
a group of sweet,
nurturing moms can make you

730
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,435
just go running, cowering

731
00:40:37,565 --> 00:40:39,480
into a dark corner,
wishing you were never born?

732
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:41,134
I promise you it can happen.

733
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:42,527
I've seen it.
And it can happen

734
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:43,963
[snaps fingers]
Just like that.

735
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:48,028
Now I can't believe I'm about
to say these words out loud,

736
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:49,316
but we got one month.

737
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,709
[Max] Oh, yeah.

738
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,754
We got one month to turn y'all

739
00:40:52,885 --> 00:40:54,285
into the greatest
group of strippers

740
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:57,193
that has ever been assembled
on planet earth.

741
00:40:57,324 --> 00:40:58,717
And to do that,

742
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:00,303
you boys got to be ready
to get your hands dirty

743
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:02,155
your noses wet, and them
nuts chafed as shit.

744
00:41:02,285 --> 00:41:03,591
[All chuckle]

745
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:06,376
And look, if,
if we do our jobs right...

746
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:09,075
You're gonna have a whole
other problem on your hands.

747
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:10,729
You're gonna have to learn

748
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:13,079
to protect yourself
in a zombie apocalypse

749
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:14,646
of repressed desire.

750
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:16,648
Any questions?

751
00:41:16,778 --> 00:41:17,858
[Hannah] I have a question.

752
00:41:20,086 --> 00:41:22,305
Can you, you know,
fuck a zombie to death?

753
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:24,133
Or is it still a kill shot
to the head?

754
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:25,395
[Mike chuckles]

755
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:27,354
Excuse me,
what are you doing here?

756
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,791
I mean, you didn't
technically fire me,

757
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:35,101
so I'm still drawing out
that salary.

758
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:38,757
Oh, I'm sorry. I should
have been more clear.

759
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:40,062
You're still getting paid,

760
00:41:40,193 --> 00:41:42,108
but we no longer
need your services.

761
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,914
I shouldn't have gotten
my hopes up. [Slight chuckle]

762
00:41:45,938 --> 00:41:49,681
I was just really inspired
by our new director's vision.

763
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:52,727
What... um, what did I say?

764
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:54,512
He didn't say anything.

765
00:41:54,642 --> 00:41:57,732
It's not what you said.
It's who you are.

766
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,040
Do you have any idea of how long

767
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,129
I've been dreaming
of someone to walk through

768
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:05,523
that door with a flame thrower

769
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:09,048
and burn this whole
fucking shit to the ground?

770
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:11,398
I can't stand
playing lady Isabel.

771
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,226
For the last six months,

772
00:42:13,356 --> 00:42:17,099
I've wanted to choke the life
out of that entitled prude.

773
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:20,189
I mean, get a grip, woman.
Jesus Christ.

774
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,061
Like you're rich,

775
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:23,758
send a fucking carriage to town,

776
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:25,934
buy up every able-bodied man...

777
00:42:26,065 --> 00:42:28,371
Soldier, sailor
instead of wasting your time

778
00:42:28,502 --> 00:42:29,982
worrying about
which boring old sod

779
00:42:30,112 --> 00:42:31,525
you're going
to sign your life away to

780
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,767
and have a lovely

781
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:36,554
half-decent shag
with every last one! I...

782
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:46,302
But it's a really good job,
it's so stable, and, um...

783
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,654
So usually
I don't say all of that.

784
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:51,873
Well, that was poetic.

785
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:54,354
You're definitely our audience.

786
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:56,269
Woody, make sure
she gets an invitation.

787
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:58,967
Hey, we're still calling this
Isabel ascendant, right?

788
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:00,273
Yeah, but that's just a trick

789
00:43:00,403 --> 00:43:01,729
to get the audience
into the theater

790
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:02,817
so then we can give them
something else.

791
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:04,320
Right, but if, what if we use

792
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:06,453
the actual old opening
to Isabel ascendant?

793
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,934
I mean, it could be a really
big surprise actually.

794
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:10,544
And if I'm honest...

795
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:11,937
If you want to make a show

796
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:13,503
about women
getting what they want,

797
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:14,959
wouldn't it be
a little fucking chauvinistic

798
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:16,263
to not have a female lead in it?

799
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:17,353
Are you calling me chauvinistic?

800
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:18,508
No.

801
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:19,839
Because I'm the feminist here.

802
00:43:19,901 --> 00:43:20,965
- Right.
- I'm the flame-thrower.

803
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:22,730
This whole thing was my idea.

804
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,994
You heard her.
She's the flame-thrower.

805
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,083
Uh, you're hired as Isabel

806
00:43:28,214 --> 00:43:29,454
because you were already hired.

807
00:43:29,563 --> 00:43:30,627
[Squeals] Oh.
Go... I am thrilled!

808
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:32,000
Thank you both so much.

809
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:37,310
Will you be dancing in it?

810
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,443
Uh, no. Just, uh, directing.
Right?

811
00:43:40,574 --> 00:43:43,708
Aw, shame.

812
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:47,929
Well now that we have
a leading lady again

813
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,844
maybe the director
should walk us

814
00:43:49,975 --> 00:43:52,891
through the beats
of the first act.

815
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:56,590
[Clears throat] Yep.
Uh, first act, coming up.

816
00:43:56,721 --> 00:43:58,287
Enter Jackson,

817
00:43:58,418 --> 00:44:00,420
the low-class but sexy friend
of the husband. Line?

818
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,616
Harold said you didn't want
to go to calais this year.

819
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,858
Is that still settled?

820
00:44:03,989 --> 00:44:05,773
- I'm sick to death of calais.
- Theo?

821
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:07,949
I won't hear of it.
You're going and that's that.

822
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,647
Perfect. Hit it.

823
00:44:09,777 --> 00:44:11,015
["Ferrari" by Jack rayner
plays over speakers]

824
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:12,039
[Hannah giggles]

825
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:14,303
Oh, come on. No. No. No, no.

826
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:15,846
Come on, Mike. Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop!

827
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,524
Hey. All right,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

828
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,221
Stop. What's up?

829
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:21,615
They can't just start dancing
on her out of nowhere.

830
00:44:21,746 --> 00:44:24,313
I mean, I'm down as fuck.

831
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:25,644
Okay. Uh,
isn't that the point?

832
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,750
No, no, no.

833
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:28,361
You cannot interrupt the plot.

834
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:30,102
If you want a strong female lead

835
00:44:30,232 --> 00:44:31,581
she has to have an objective.

836
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:33,232
At least we should know
what she wants.

837
00:44:33,322 --> 00:44:35,803
Okay. [Sighs] What do you
think she wants then?

838
00:44:35,934 --> 00:44:39,807
I don't know. I know she
doesn't want this life.

839
00:44:39,938 --> 00:44:41,504
So she wants to run away?

840
00:44:41,635 --> 00:44:43,593
She can't do that.

841
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:46,161
Why?
She's a free person, right?

842
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:49,556
She has a family.
There would be consequences.

843
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,210
Right.
So it's about the money.

844
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,733
Oh, that's the least of it.

845
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:54,953
She would lose her friends,
opportunities.

846
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:58,696
Her identity. Her whole world
would be torn apart.

847
00:44:58,826 --> 00:45:01,186
I don't know. It sounds to me
that she just needs to let go.

848
00:45:01,263 --> 00:45:03,439
- And some good dick!
- Maybe that as well.

849
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:07,269
This show is not about
getting dick. Only.

850
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:10,359
She needs to solve her dilemma.

851
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,797
It's not like some
magic unicorn is gonna

852
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:15,495
come down and make all her
wildest fantasies come true.

853
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:18,759
Uh, what was that?

854
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:24,504
Could be not the worst idea.

855
00:45:26,288 --> 00:45:27,768
Oh, no way.

856
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:30,902
Hear me out.
Just... what about...

857
00:45:31,032 --> 00:45:33,513
Where the fuck am I
gonna get a horse?

858
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:35,341
What about a caballito?
Like a tiny one.

859
00:45:35,471 --> 00:45:36,821
I don't have caballito budget.

860
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:38,799
Wait. What... how... okay,
what if you don't see it?

861
00:45:38,823 --> 00:45:40,103
What if you don't see the horse?

862
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:44,219
No, that's not right.

863
00:45:46,482 --> 00:45:47,483
No.

864
00:45:47,614 --> 00:45:49,659
[Victor clears his throat]

865
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,590
[Sighs] How long have you
been standing there?

866
00:45:51,661 --> 00:45:54,664
- Long enough. May I?
- Yes.

867
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:00,627
So you've worked with Max

868
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,716
and this Roger dude a long time?

869
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:05,023
All 18 wonderful years.

870
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:06,764
Wow. So you must know
these friends

871
00:46:06,894 --> 00:46:08,132

What are they like?

873
00:46:09,723 --> 00:46:12,204
Hmm. They like things
to stay the same, sir.

874
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,685
All right.

875
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:18,079
How do I look? And don't
give me any bullshit answer.

- You! That suit.

[Zadie] One of the most
primal feelings

884

human beings experience
is the desire to belong

885
00:46:57,989 --> 00:46:59,947
to feel connected
to other beings,

886
00:47:00,078 --> 00:47:01,949
and to be part of a tribe.

887
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,038

891

bring people together.

at him in a tie.

Yeah, but to do that properly...

Uh, Phoebe, but I...

943

You know, the way that I think
we were looking at it is

944
00:49:06,508 --> 00:49:07,659
that it really needed to be
stripped down,

945

oiled, and spanked.

while you can because

and super unavailable.

to litigate.

that at the end of it

- Yeah.

What she needs is to be
able to stay with him,

988

but not actually be with him.

989

Well, I'm the owner of this

1219
01:01:45,136 --> 01:01:46,659
Oh, I would think so.

1220
01:01:53,274 --> 01:01:54,406
Anything else?

1221
01:01:56,756 --> 01:01:58,279
You'll be hearing from us.

1222
01:02:03,371 --> 01:02:04,590

I'm sorry, baby,

1235

What if we just do it anyway?

1236

Even if I pay the fine,

to bend the rules.

1243

- Isn't it, Victor?
- Well, in my opinion...

1245

We have to go
all the way to the top

1246

is an illusion.

1247

Yes, see when you start
with no rights at all...

1248
01:03:02,648 --> 01:03:04,389
So who is this person
we need to seduce

1249

she's most likely single
and lives alone.

This bird's got to have
a heart of stone

1273
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,236

Maybe, but everybody
wants something.

what she wants?

1277
01:04:59,808 --> 01:05:01,419
Well, that never stopped men

with the wrong answer.

Come on, guys,
give me something.

1280
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,946
Victor, don't just sit there.

1281
01:05:07,077 --> 01:05:08,643
I'll murder her
for the right price.

1282
01:05:08,774 --> 01:05:10,210
That might be the best idea.

1283

But, look, this feels like

1284
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,431
a woman's perspective
sort of a thing.

1285
01:05:13,561 --> 01:05:15,781

before Miami?

Someone came along and
gave me this unexpected

magical moment that made
me remember who I really was.

1290
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:35,148
It was like a little treasure.

1291
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:37,934
Okay, so we need to figure out
who edna was before

1292
01:05:38,064 --> 01:05:40,240
she became a bureaucrat
and tap into that then.

- It's a different beat.
- It is great. I agree.

- "Permission," "suits."

1305

I know it by heart.
And you know what's more

1306
01:07:37,836 --> 01:07:39,011

of the whole show.

will dance out into the crowd.

for a reason. I don't...

right now?

I've said yes on every
single part of the show.

different, something personal.

01:10:49,288 --> 01:10:51,421
What are we to make
of the word "love"

1387
01:10:51,551 --> 01:10:53,423
in the context of dancing?

1388
01:10:53,553 --> 01:10:55,903
If you love dancing
with someone,

1389
01:10:56,034 --> 01:10:58,645
does that mean on some level
that you love them?

1390
01:10:58,776 --> 01:11:01,909
What other feelings are
exchanged during a dance?

1391
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,434
Can you dance with someone
you don't trust?

1392
01:11:04,564 --> 01:11:07,524
Should you trust someone
just because they can dance?

1393
01:11:07,654 --> 01:11:10,004
Max and Mike weren't
thinking about this,

1394
01:11:10,135 --> 01:11:11,484
but they should have been.

1395
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,138
[Edna] Stop the music!

1396
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,619
Stop the music!
Stop the music.

1397
01:11:16,837 --> 01:11:18,274
- Edna?
- Edna?

1398
01:11:18,404 --> 01:11:20,145
I am so sorry, Ms. Mendoza.

1399
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,755
I am so deeply sorry

1400
01:11:21,886 --> 01:11:24,323
to each and every one of you
beautiful creatures.

1401
01:11:24,454 --> 01:11:25,672
Sorry for what?

1402
01:11:25,803 --> 01:11:27,413
Height restrictions
for stage risers.

1403
01:11:27,544 --> 01:11:29,110
Apparently, your new stage

1404
01:11:29,241 --> 01:11:30,610
is three quarters of an inch
too high.

1405
01:11:30,634 --> 01:11:32,157
Your exemption has been denied.

1406
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,725
You're to shut down immediately.

1407
01:11:34,855 --> 01:11:36,901
But you had already approved it!

1408
01:11:37,031 --> 01:11:40,861
I got a call from an
mp's office. It's law. [Sighs]

1409
01:11:40,992 --> 01:11:42,298
There's nothing I can do.

1410
01:11:44,561 --> 01:11:47,781
Keep working. I'll take care
of this. I'll be right back.

1411
01:11:47,912 --> 01:11:48,912
Okay.

1412
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:05,886
How fucking dare you?

1413
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:08,672
You're not shutting me
down again. Not this time.

1414
01:12:08,802 --> 01:12:11,631
Max, I sincerely
want to rebuild our trust.

1415
01:12:11,762 --> 01:12:13,024
- [Scoffs]
- In the meantime,

1416
01:12:13,154 --> 01:12:14,982
I'm just trying
to look out for you.

1417
01:12:15,113 --> 01:12:17,245
How is shutting down my show
looking out for me?

1418
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:18,616
I'm not talking about the show.

1419
01:12:18,725 --> 01:12:20,005
Then what are you talking about?

1420
01:12:20,031 --> 01:12:21,946
I'm talking about your judgment.

1421
01:12:22,076 --> 01:12:24,122
I'm talking what I witnessed
in the kitchen

1422
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:25,384
in front of our daughter.

1423
01:12:25,515 --> 01:12:28,039
Roger, I wouldn't
get into a dispute

1424
01:12:28,169 --> 01:12:29,867
about judgment with me
right now.

1425
01:12:29,997 --> 01:12:33,392
You handed my family's theater
over to a fucking stripper.

1426
01:12:35,133 --> 01:12:37,396
You don't know anything
about Mike.

1427
01:12:37,527 --> 01:12:41,008
I know when you're being used.
Don't you see that?

1428
01:12:41,487 --> 01:12:42,488
No.

1429
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:46,884
Darling, I know
we're all getting old,

1430
01:12:47,014 --> 01:12:49,365
but I didn't know
you were so desperate.

1431
01:12:49,495 --> 01:12:52,585
Fuck you!
We care for each other.

1432
01:12:52,716 --> 01:12:55,632
Max, have you even read
our settlement agreement?

1433
01:12:55,762 --> 01:12:59,200
The language about denigrating
or harming the family brand?

1434
01:12:59,331 --> 01:13:01,115
The moment that show goes up,

1435
01:13:01,246 --> 01:13:03,030
mother's barristers
will be clawing back

1436
01:13:03,161 --> 01:13:04,945
every last shilling in court

1437
01:13:05,076 --> 01:13:06,773
and I won't be able to stop her.

1438
01:13:06,904 --> 01:13:10,211
But if you're still too
deluded to help yourself,

1439
01:13:10,342 --> 01:13:12,518
please be mindful of zadie.

1440
01:13:12,649 --> 01:13:15,695
She shouldn't have to pay
the price for your fantasies.

1441
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:22,789
Would you please stop it?

1442
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,704
What?

1443
01:13:24,835 --> 01:13:26,489
I know what you're thinking.

1444
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:28,404
You're thinking,
"what was she thinking?"

1445
01:13:28,534 --> 01:13:30,144
You weren't thinking, were you?

1446
01:13:30,275 --> 01:13:31,407
You were falling in love.

1447
01:13:31,537 --> 01:13:33,104
Oh, shut the fuck up.

1448
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:34,845
You think I don't know that?

1449
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,282
And don't you dare judge me.
You were not there.

1450
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,676
That one fucking dance...

1451
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:42,505
Changed everything in me.

1452
01:13:45,508 --> 01:13:49,642
It feels like it made me
the best version of myself...

1453
01:13:49,773 --> 01:13:51,035
But everybody's laughing at me.

1454
01:13:51,165 --> 01:13:52,863
I'm a joke. An embarrassment.

1455
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,475
[Sighs] Not to him though.

1456
01:13:58,695 --> 01:14:00,523
He believes in me.

1457
01:14:00,653 --> 01:14:02,394
I have to go tell him

1458
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:05,658
that our show about empowering
women is dead...

1459
01:14:05,789 --> 01:14:08,400
Because I'm so
fucking powerless.

1460
01:14:10,315 --> 01:14:12,839
The most frightening part
is that...

1461
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:15,015
I'm about to find out
if that dance

1462
01:14:15,146 --> 01:14:17,975
meant as much to him
as it did to me.

1463
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:23,850
Or if I'm just another
goddamn Tuesday.

1464
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:26,026
No, you're more like
a Thursday, madame.

1465

Have I always
been this adolescent?

1466
01:14:31,336 --> 01:14:34,426
No. Only when it's raining.

Uh, Jack, keep taking
them through.

1471

What the fuck you mean
"we're done"?

1472

I'm sorry. I did my best,
but I failed.

1473
01:14:59,190 --> 01:15:01,150
- Wait. What... all right.
- Victor will come back

1474

and pick you up,

1475
01:15:02,759 --> 01:15:04,258
and he can arrange
a flight for you tomorrow.

No, no, no. What happened?
This isn't you.

You couldn't even come up

isn't fucking special.

You cannot say that.
I know you can't.

have to let it go.

We are very pleased.

We are hoping
to have a son, of course.

1601

That way the legacy of
chuffingham will be secure.

01:34:53,426 --> 01:34:55,211
Oh, yes, yes. So you go.

1729
01:34:55,341 --> 01:34:59,345
And no peeking.
He'll be watching you.

1730

[Hannah] Now folks,
this next dance

1731
01:35:02,522 --> 01:35:05,308
is one that
I'm well-acquainted with.

1732
01:35:05,438 --> 01:35:09,660
Things are about
to get intimate.

1733
01:35:09,791 --> 01:35:12,445
[Audience cheers]

1734
01:35:12,576 --> 01:35:17,102
Now, a real man isn't afraid
to act on his desire...

1735
01:35:17,233 --> 01:35:20,802
But the sexiest act
of submission...

1736
01:35:20,932 --> 01:35:23,892
Is asking for permission.

1737
01:35:24,022 --> 01:35:25,822
["Permission" by ro James

1742
01:37:19,398 --> 01:37:20,573
Aw, bless ya.

1743
01:37:36,067 --> 01:37:38,069
I know. I know.

1744
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:40,637
We all want
a little bit of everything

1745
01:37:40,767 --> 01:37:42,857
all of the time. Don't we?

1746
01:37:42,987 --> 01:37:44,249
But...

1747
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:47,513
Sometimes you just want to be

1748
01:37:47,644 --> 01:37:51,343
everything to someone. Right?

1749
01:37:53,519 --> 01:37:58,046
Sometimes, the greatest
fantasy of them all...

1750
01:37:58,176 --> 01:38:00,265
Is knowing
that you're the only one.

1751

You said to go hard,
and so I did what you said.

1760
01:43:24,894 --> 01:43:25,982
I mean, you know.

1761
01:43:26,112 --> 01:43:27,112
Oh, god.

1762
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:28,201
We showed up.

["Pony" by ginuwine

1764
01:43:34,904 --> 01:43:35,948
That's "pony."

1765
01:43:36,079 --> 01:43:37,254
Mike said after "pony."

1766
01:43:37,385 --> 01:43:39,169
No, he just said "pony."

1767
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:41,040
He definitely said after "pony"

1768
01:43:41,171 --> 01:43:43,173
and they're still
on their ponies. Now sit.

1769

It must be over now.

1773

1778

Wait a minute. Just a second.

1779

Thank you very much, Mr. Mike.

1780

Very nice, my friend.

I love you. Okay?

Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

If you're not gonna leave him,

I don't want this
to be more confusing.

It's done. I'm never, ever,
ever going back to him.

[Zadie] No one can claim

1803
01:46:47,705 --> 01:46:50,578
to fully understand
what exactly dance is...

1804
01:46:50,708 --> 01:46:52,406
But what is abundantly clear

1805
01:46:52,536 --> 01:46:56,105
is that dance seeks
no meaning for its desires.

1806
01:46:56,235 --> 01:47:00,675
It does not value age
or status, logic or reason.

1807
01:47:00,805 --> 01:47:04,113
It is a compass orientated
only to Liberty,

1808
01:47:04,243 --> 01:47:05,984
not unlike the human heart.

1809
01:47:06,115 --> 01:47:07,986
I stumbled upon these wisdoms

1810

named Mike.
