1
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,635
I didn't hear you come in.
We're not quite open yet.

2
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:23,436
Don't mind me, young one.
I just need to rest these tired bones

3
00:03:23,542 --> 00:03:27,137
while I await this evening's festivities.

4
00:03:27,245 --> 00:03:29,770
With all these goblins around,
I'm afraid this place isn't

5
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:31,746
as festive as it used to be.

6
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,045
Maybe you could
distract me with a tale?

7
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:37,916
Very well. I know just the one.

8
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:44,361
Now, how does it start again?
I've never been good with beginnings.

9
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:49,395
Oh, yes. The stars.

10
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,461
Since the dawn of time,

11
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:58,168
<i>the Gods of Light have watched over</i>
<i>the world of Krynn from the heavens.</i>

12
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:01,074
<i>They have given us</i>
<i>many wondrous gifts,</i>

13
00:04:01,213 --> 00:04:04,671
<i>bountiful harvests, moral guidance,</i>

14
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:09,287
<i>and, most amazing of all,</i>
<i>magical healing.</i>

15
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:13,082
I thought the Gods of Light left us
and took their healing with them.

16
00:04:13,358 --> 00:04:14,825
So it is said.

17
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:19,692
<i>But the Gods of Light</i>
<i>have always been opposed</i>

18
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:25,462
<i>by the Queen of Darkness,</i>
<i>Takhisis, and her evil allies.</i>

19
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,300
<i>In the First Age,</i>
<i>she and her dragon armies</i>

20
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:33,276
<i>waged a war to dominate the world,</i>
<i>and she was winning.</i>

21
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:37,040
<i>But the peoples of the world,</i>
<i>men, elves and dwarves,</i>

22
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:41,609
<i>united behind the Gods of Light</i>
<i>and prayed for help.</i>

23
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,315
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>with the help of the Gods of Light,</i>

24
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:50,657
<i>especially the warrior god, Paladine,</i>
<i>the good peoples of Krynn prevailed,</i>

25
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:54,254
<i>saving the world from</i>
<i>the evil reign of Takhisis.</i>

26
00:04:57,235 --> 00:05:01,672
Unfortunately, this victory
made the people arrogant.

27
00:05:01,773 --> 00:05:05,641
Now believing themselves
more powerful than their protectors,

28
00:05:05,744 --> 00:05:09,544
<i>the people began to command</i>
<i>the gods to do their bidding.</i>

29
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:14,881
<i>The gods</i>' <i>response was</i>
<i>swift and devastating.</i>

30
00:05:14,986 --> 00:05:19,013
<i>The</i> C<i>ataclysm changed</i>
<i>the very face of Krynn.</i>

31
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:22,025
<i>The gods were never heard from again,</i>

32
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:25,153
<i>leaving the people of the world</i>
<i>to fight for survival</i>

33
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:29,199
without their help,
without their guidance.

34
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:34,368
<i>Belief in the gods waned,</i>
<i>shattering the unity of the races.</i>

35
00:05:34,473 --> 00:05:39,240
<i>Elves, dwarves and men</i>
<i>grew to distrust and fight one another.</i>

36
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:44,475
<i>And so began the Age of Despair.</i>

37
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:48,451
<i>Three hundred years have</i>
<i>come and gone</i>

38
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:53,115
<i>and still the gods remain silent</i>
<i>in the heavens.</i>

39
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:59,220
DDo you think they'll ever return?
DUnfortunately, one already has.

40
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:05,830
And without the Gods of Light
to protect us, Krynn is surely doomed.

41
00:06:05,937 --> 00:06:09,532
Takhisis, my queen.

42
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:12,838
I return with news
of our impending victory.

43
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:20,340
Rise, Highlord Verminaard.

44
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:23,748
I've destroyed Silvanesti in the east.

45
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:27,347
Now only the northern lands
remain to be taken.

46
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:29,791
But have you located the staff?

47
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:32,420
I've dispatched forces
to scour the lands.

48
00:06:32,531 --> 00:06:35,864
The staff will be found.

49
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:39,164
Do not underestimate
the danger it poses.

50
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:43,731
That staff has the power
to reawaken the Gods of Light.

51
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:46,709
It must not be allowed
to reach Xak Tsaroth.

52
00:06:46,812 --> 00:06:50,543
I will let nothing interfere
with your plans, my queen.

53
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:54,085
I'm sending my greatest warrior
to guard the city.

54
00:06:54,186 --> 00:06:56,677
Even if the staff reaches Xak Tsaroth,

55
00:06:56,788 --> 00:07:00,554
Onyx will make sure the
Disks of Mishakal remain in our hands,

56
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:03,594
so the prophecy can never be fulfilled.

57
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:08,826
Fail me, Verminaard,
and it will be the last thing you ever do.

58
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:17,633
I trust only you to carry out this task.

59
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:23,204
Capture the staff,
and guard the Disks with your life.

60
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:25,579
Yes, my lord.

61
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:42,130
Tanis? Is that you?

62
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,601
DHello, old friend.
DOId?

63
00:07:45,704 --> 00:07:48,366
Well, you've learned no manners
in five years.

64
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:52,304
Hoisting me around
like a sack of potatoes.

65
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:55,274
I hope no one saw us.

66
00:07:57,048 --> 00:08:02,213
DFlint, you haven't changed at all.
DYou have. Why the beard?

67
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,651
Weren't you ugly enough?

68
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:07,953
I've been traveling in lands
dangerous to those with elven blood.

69
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:10,357
The beard helped hide my heritage.

70
00:08:10,462 --> 00:08:14,193
I guess it's the only good thing
my human father ever gave me.

71
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:18,963
What are you doing sitting out here?
It's just a few more miles to Solace.

72
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,234
I'm not too old to make it without
resting, if that's what you're getting at.

73
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:28,812
DI just needed to finish this whittling.
DI see.

74
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,978
Well, we do have friends
waiting for us at the inn.

75
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,244
I wouldn't want to be late.

76
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:37,879
A little overeager for our reunion,
aren't you?

77
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:41,891
Now, who might you be
so anxious to see? Kitiara, maybe?

78
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:47,323
I figured she'd be your choice.
I mean, Laurana's beautiful, sure,

79
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:51,664
but it was complicated,
what with the elves and all.

80
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:54,567
And her father really didn't like you.

81
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:57,369
DYeah, can we just go?
DFine.

82
00:09:00,445 --> 00:09:04,404
So did you find
what you went looking for?

83
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:07,246
Proof the gods have returned? No.

84
00:09:07,652 --> 00:09:12,680
I heard tales of magical healing,
but it was all trickery.

85
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:16,852
I never found any real healing magic,
which means it's true.

86
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:19,692
The gods abandoned Krynn
300 years ago.

87
00:09:19,798 --> 00:09:22,266
I guess my faith in them was misplaced.

88
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:26,064
Sorry, Tanis.
I know how important this was to you.

89
00:09:30,275 --> 00:09:32,175
Horse!

90
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:38,006
And hobgoblin.

91
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:44,680
Halt! No one is allowed to walk
within the limits of Solace after dark.

92
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:50,117
DYou are under arrest.
DBy whose authority?

93
00:09:50,228 --> 00:09:55,598
My own. I am Fewmaster Toede,
leader of the forces

94
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:01,070
keeping Solace safe from
undesirable elements like yourselves.

95
00:10:01,172 --> 00:10:06,007
DSearch them for the staff!
Dlf any of you goblin scum touch me...

96
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:09,271
We've been away from Solace
for many years.

97
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:12,578
We didn't intend to break any laws.
If you'll just let us pass...

98
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:16,313
If they resist, kill them.

99
00:10:17,322 --> 00:10:20,689
I advise you to back off. Now.

100
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:28,292
Only one thing I hate more
than a gully dwarf, and that's a goblin.

101
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:45,410
DWhat are you slime doing in Solace?
DSlime? At least I'm not a halfDbreed.

102
00:11:05,737 --> 00:11:07,136
Tanis!

103
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:12,407
Tasslehoff?

104
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:35,692
Next time, don't get started without me.
I don't want to miss any of the fun.

105
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,995
Like we need a kender's help.

106
00:11:42,407 --> 00:11:46,935
My human side got the best of me.
I shouldn't be so aggressive.

107
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:51,048
They were asking for it.

108
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:54,240
Come on. You know how Caramon eats.

109
00:11:54,352 --> 00:11:57,116
If we don't get to the inn soon,
there won't even be a crumb left,

110
00:11:57,222 --> 00:11:59,281
and I'm starving.

111
00:12:08,766 --> 00:12:11,826
Great. You can never get
that goblin smell out.

112
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:16,100
DThen throw it away.
DI can't do that. It's Flint's.

113
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:19,665
DWhy, you little thief!
DYou dropped it during the fight.

114
00:12:19,777 --> 00:12:22,905
I just picked it up for you.
You should be thanking me.

115
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,458
Look!
Sturm and Caramon are already here!

116
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,998
Tas!

117
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,431
Watch your purse, Caramon.
That little kender has sticky fingers.

118
00:13:25,343 --> 00:13:28,779
Nice beard.
I'm sure it'll look good when it grows in.

119
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:32,147
Very funny.

120
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,678
Dls your brother coming?
DI am already here.

121
00:13:41,893 --> 00:13:44,054
I see my appearance startles you.

122
00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:48,189
A small price to pay for the power
I have achieved, I assure you.

123
00:13:50,868 --> 00:13:53,962
He's been this way since
the test at the Tower of High Sorcery.

124
00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:55,300
What about Kitiara?

125
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:59,137
She'll be here, Tanis.
Our sister never misses a party.

126
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:06,716
DTag, you're it!
DCan't catch me!

127
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:08,683
You're it!

128
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:11,214
Hey, how come you're so short?

129
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:15,520
Well, it makes it easier to sneak away
from goblins or evil wizards.

130
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,959
Evil wizard?
I never met an evil wizard before.

131
00:14:19,063 --> 00:14:22,464
I guess it's their lucky day.
We've got one right here.

132
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:31,000
DI thought you boys would be thirsty.
DLittle Tika Waylan. You grew up fast.

133
00:14:50,962 --> 00:14:55,456
All right, Brinna, Erik. These nice men
have had a long journey home.

134
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:57,033
Let them relax.

135
00:14:57,135 --> 00:14:59,968
But I wanna hear
about their adventures.

136
00:15:00,071 --> 00:15:04,599
Look, Greybeard's about to tell a story.
You don't want to miss it, do you?

137
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:08,279
I'll only go if he does.

138
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:12,509
Now how can I turn down an invitation
from such a cute little girl?

139
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:15,248
Lead the way.

140
00:15:16,154 --> 00:15:19,646
Tika, you still serve
Otik's spiced potatoes?

141
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,218
Coming right up.

142
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:28,291
To old adventuring companions,
reunited.

143
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:36,673
So, Sturm,
did you track down your father?

144
00:15:36,774 --> 00:15:42,007
All I found of him were these,
his armor and his sword.

145
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:44,911
So, you are a knight now, are you?

146
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:51,687
I encountered some trouble with goblins
on my way here.

147
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:57,354
So did we. They wanted to impound
Raistlin's staff for further investigation.

148
00:15:57,462 --> 00:16:00,795
The ones we ran into were looking
for some kind of staff, too.

149
00:16:00,898 --> 00:16:04,959
DI wonder why it's so important.
DThere is talk of war,

150
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:08,630
armies of strange creatures
gathering in the wilderness.

151
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,538
Perhaps these things are related.

152
00:16:11,642 --> 00:16:13,610
You folks need anything?

153
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:22,185
Now, then. Once upon a time,
the great hero Huma Dragonbane...

154
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,988
My parents said he wasn't real.

155
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,120
DWho?
DHuma Dragonbane.

156
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:33,528
Huma? That name sounds familiar.

157
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:38,394
Oh, dear,
now I've lost my train of thought.

158
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:41,472
"Once upon a time,
the great hero Huma Dragonbane..."

159
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:44,105
Oh, yes. Thank you, little boy.

160
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:48,372
Once upon a time,
the great hero Huma Dragonbane

161
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:50,604
led the Knights of Solamnia

162
00:16:50,715 --> 00:16:55,743
against the evil dragons of Takhisis,
the Queen of Darkness.

163
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:06,457
Thanks, Tika.

164
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:11,266
Tanis, this came for you.

165
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:19,636
Well? Who's it from?

166
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:24,545
Kitiara. She says her duties
with her new lord are keeping her busy.

167
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:26,609
She sends her best.

168
00:17:26,717 --> 00:17:31,484
We all took a sacred oath to be here.
Well, that's done it.

169
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:37,858
The circle is broken, the oath denied.
Bad luck. Bad luck.

170
00:17:37,962 --> 00:17:42,592
New lord?
I wonder if it's business or pleasure.

171
00:17:57,215 --> 00:17:59,945
With the mighty dragonlances,

172
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:04,010
Huma and the knights
destroyed the wicked dragons,

173
00:18:04,255 --> 00:18:07,782
and Huma offered his thanks
to Paladine.

174
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:14,124
Blasphemy, heretic!
Corrupting our youth! Call the guards!

175
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:16,497
Leave him alone.

176
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:20,265
That can't be good.

177
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:26,037
How dare you speak to me like that?
I'm the High Theocrat of Solace.

178
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:30,011
This man is not a heretic.
His stories are true.

179
00:18:30,114 --> 00:18:33,345
The ancient gods are real,
and they have returned.

180
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:38,013
She's been deluded by charlatans.
It's amazing what people will believe.

181
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:41,319
Witch! She must be arrested as well.

182
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:45,486
Where are those guards?
I'm confiscating this.

183
00:18:45,596 --> 00:18:46,927
No!

184
00:18:47,098 --> 00:18:49,566
The chieftain's daughter says
you will not take it.

185
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:51,925
I take what I want.

186
00:19:05,116 --> 00:19:08,347
Hurry! Knock him down,
so we can put out the flames.

187
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:24,726
DHealing magic?
DLook at the staff!

188
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:34,935
The goblins said they'd destroy Solace

189
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:36,707
if they caught anyone
harboring the staff.

190
00:19:36,814 --> 00:19:38,679
DYou'd better get out of here.
DI was just trying to help.

191
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:43,152
DTell that to them.
DWell, you've done it again, haven't you?

192
00:19:43,254 --> 00:19:47,247
DWe must leave.
DRun? From this rabble?

193
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:51,624
There's something about that staff.
We can't let it fall into goblin hands.

194
00:19:51,729 --> 00:19:55,187
Then I will stay and face
these foul goblins in mortal combat.

195
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:58,166
Sturm, there's a lady to protect.

196
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,337
DWe have to get her out of here.
DA lady? Right.

197
00:20:06,711 --> 00:20:11,205
DMadam, I am your servant.
DWe don't need your help.

198
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:16,614
Look, you're strangers here.

199
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:19,519
We know our way around.
We can get you to safety.

200
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:23,621
Very well, lead us out of here.

201
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:52,479
Raist, hang onto me.

202
00:20:54,592 --> 00:20:55,889
Raist!

203
00:21:05,636 --> 00:21:07,934
DThere they are!
DCome on!

204
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,378
Look what we've found.
Give me the staff.

205
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:23,713
Kill them!

206
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,408
I'll get reinforcements!

207
00:21:51,415 --> 00:21:55,112
DGoing somewhere?
DGet them! Stop them!

208
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,667
Let's get out of here
before more of them show up!

209
00:22:40,998 --> 00:22:44,934
Great! We're trapped
between the goblins and the water.

210
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:47,134
Now what are we gonna do?

211
00:22:47,238 --> 00:22:49,399
Flint, I'm gonna give this to you straight.

212
00:22:50,441 --> 00:22:52,204
We're taking a boat.

213
00:22:54,645 --> 00:22:56,704
I am not getting in that boat!

214
00:22:56,814 --> 00:23:00,648
That accident was 10 years ago.
Look, I'll make sure Caramon sits still.

215
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:03,811
Absolutely not. I took a vow.

216
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:07,446
DTanis, search parties.
DEveryone in the boat, now!

217
00:23:16,934 --> 00:23:18,902
Flint, get in!

218
00:23:19,003 --> 00:23:22,131
I'd rather take my chances
with the goblins.

219
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:31,012
There they are! Seize them!

220
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:35,451
DThey're getting away!
DWait!

221
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,160
DToede.
DArchers, flame!

222
00:23:54,905 --> 00:23:57,703
Archers, loose!

223
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:02,110
Loose!

224
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:06,249
Put those flames out!

225
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,945
We're sitting ducks!

226
00:24:12,957 --> 00:24:16,120
Hey, sit still!

227
00:24:16,227 --> 00:24:18,627
Raistlin,
you have anything up your sleeve?

228
00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:20,788
More than you'll ever know.

229
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:36,471
DGood work, Brother!
DStop them! They're getting away!

230
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:39,643
Do it again!
Get the big ugly one this time!

231
00:24:41,085 --> 00:24:43,485
I can't. I must rest.

232
00:24:43,721 --> 00:24:47,418
You said you'd achieved
great magical power.

233
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,520
No matter how powerful a wizard is,

234
00:24:50,628 --> 00:24:54,428
he's limited to the number of spells
he can cast each day.

235
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:57,022
I know that, but I've never seen a wizard

236
00:24:57,134 --> 00:25:00,467
get so exhausted
just from casting spells.

237
00:25:00,571 --> 00:25:04,302
The test in the Tower of High Sorcery
almost killed him, that's why.

238
00:25:06,477 --> 00:25:07,671
Interesting.

239
00:25:07,778 --> 00:25:11,009
And why do you talk in that
funny language when you're casting?

240
00:25:11,115 --> 00:25:14,516
I healed that man's burns
without saying anything.

241
00:25:15,986 --> 00:25:18,079
Well, maybe the staff helped a little.

242
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:35,237
Tanis, the constellations of the gods,
Takhisis the Queen of Darkness

243
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:38,934
and Paladine the Valiant Warrior,
they're gone.

244
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:41,170
It's only a bunch of stars, Raist.

245
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:47,710
DWhat do you think this means?
DChaos. War.

246
00:25:47,818 --> 00:25:51,185
Death. That is what I see.

247
00:26:09,073 --> 00:26:10,404
We hid the boat.

248
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:14,102
Thank you for risking your lives for us,
even though we are strangers.

249
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:17,977
I'm Tanis.
The brothers are Caramon and Raistlin.

250
00:26:18,115 --> 00:26:20,083
The knight, Sturm Brightblade.

251
00:26:20,184 --> 00:26:22,152
Flint Fireforge carries our wine,

252
00:26:22,252 --> 00:26:26,712
and Tasslehoff Burrfoot
is our clever little locksmith.

253
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:28,588
And you are?

254
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:32,423
DGoldmoon and Riverwind.
DWe're strangers no longer.

255
00:26:33,998 --> 00:26:35,727
Feeling any better?

256
00:26:39,103 --> 00:26:40,934
DPerhaps my staff will...
DNo.

257
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,235
My body was my sacrifice for my magic.

258
00:26:45,242 --> 00:26:49,702
DThe damage is permanent.
DYour staff healed that man at the inn.

259
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:52,475
DHow?
DI don't know.

260
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,949
DI haven't had it very long.
DWhere'd you get it?

261
00:26:55,052 --> 00:26:58,920
Riverwind discovered it on a quest
to an ancient abandoned city.

262
00:26:59,023 --> 00:27:02,789
He... We believed it was
a gift from the Gods of Light,

263
00:27:02,893 --> 00:27:06,727
but the people of our village called us
heretics and condemned us to death.

264
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:11,597
When they tried to stone us, the staff
magically transported us to safety.

265
00:27:11,702 --> 00:27:14,364
Only the true gods
can grant real healing magic.

266
00:27:14,471 --> 00:27:17,065
Maybe this is proof they've returned.

267
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:19,972
We came west hoping to discover
the truth about the staff.

268
00:27:20,077 --> 00:27:22,705
The Highseekers in Haven might
be able to tell us where it came from,

269
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:25,338
Dwhat its powers are.
DEnough!

270
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:26,711
We never asked for your help.

271
00:27:26,817 --> 00:27:29,047
In the morning,
we go our separate ways.

272
00:27:29,153 --> 00:27:31,986
We can't let this magic
fall into the hands of the goblins.

273
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:34,057
The staff will be safer
with more protectors.

274
00:27:34,158 --> 00:27:37,992
Listen with those big pointy ears.
I don't trust you, halfDbreed.

275
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:41,826
Speak to him like that again,
and I will cut you down where you stand!

276
00:27:41,932 --> 00:27:44,127
If it's a fight you want, you shall have it.

277
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,607
Riverwind!

278
00:27:53,977 --> 00:27:56,571
I'm sorry. Like the rest of my people,

279
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,649
Riverwind doesn't trust those
who aren't human.

280
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,150
And what of you, my lady?

281
00:28:02,252 --> 00:28:06,245
Once I held the same prejudice,
but no longer.

282
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:08,984
We will be honored
to travel with you and your friends.

283
00:28:09,093 --> 00:28:10,685
Tas, you got a map?

284
00:28:10,794 --> 00:28:14,628
I didn't steal anything!
I mean, let me check.

285
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:17,427
Hey! Laurana gave me that ring.

286
00:28:17,534 --> 00:28:20,162
This? You must've dropped it
back at the inn.

287
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,135
You're lucky I picked it up.

288
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,235
So, you think the staff
might lead to the Gods of Light?

289
00:28:27,344 --> 00:28:31,371
Does this mean your faith in them
has been resurrected?

290
00:28:31,482 --> 00:28:34,315
It means I'm open to the possibility.

291
00:28:44,294 --> 00:28:48,230
DHighlord, the Blue Crystal Staff...
Dlt's been found?

292
00:28:48,332 --> 00:28:50,266
No, my lord.

293
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:52,892
It was tracked
to one of the plainsmen tribes.

294
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:56,700
The village was searched thoroughly,
but it wasn't there.

295
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,900
Takhisis will not be pleased.

296
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:05,346
No, wait, my lord. The staff was seen
in a place called Solace.

297
00:29:05,449 --> 00:29:10,409
If the enemy has the staff,
they may also know about the Disks.

298
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:14,355
Warn Onyx, and send my elite troops
north to Solace.

299
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:19,153
One way or the other,
I will have that staff.

300
00:29:27,104 --> 00:29:29,197
You think there might be goblins
living in there?

301
00:29:29,306 --> 00:29:34,073
I wish. I'll fight the living
any day of the week, but not the dead.

302
00:29:34,178 --> 00:29:37,705
DThe dead!
DAII you need to know, kender,

303
00:29:37,814 --> 00:29:41,272
is that none who enter Darken Wood
ever return.

304
00:29:41,385 --> 00:29:44,183
Sounds like an adventure
just waiting to happen.

305
00:29:45,322 --> 00:29:47,552
We're already on an adventure.

306
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:51,225
DWe can stop for a rest, if you want.
DWho, me? I'm fine.

307
00:29:51,328 --> 00:29:54,058
Actually, this is a good place to stop
for a moment

308
00:29:54,164 --> 00:29:55,825
before we round that bend.

309
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:58,697
DFor the record, I could keep going.
DI know.

310
00:29:58,802 --> 00:30:03,398
DTas, can you scout ahead?
DFinally, something fun to do.

311
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:06,237
Now, look. No roaming off the road.

312
00:30:06,343 --> 00:30:08,811
Keep your hands
out of people's belongings.

313
00:30:08,912 --> 00:30:11,881
Unless they're bakers,
or fishmongers, or...

314
00:30:11,982 --> 00:30:14,212
Caramon, you mind?

315
00:30:14,318 --> 00:30:16,286
Don't worry, Tanis. Be right back.

316
00:30:16,386 --> 00:30:20,049
<i>Your one true love</i>'<i>s a sailing ship</i>
<i>that anchors at our pier</i>

317
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,249
<i>We lift her sails, we man her decks</i>
<i>We scrub</i>

318
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,849
Crazy kender.

319
00:30:25,729 --> 00:30:27,026
Can I get you anything, Raist?

320
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:31,157
I am preparing my spells.
All I require is to be left alone.

321
00:30:33,337 --> 00:30:36,795
Well, I'll be right over there
if you need me.

322
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:46,677
No, we can't.

323
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:58,589
Problem?

324
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:01,493
He is a shepherd,
and I am a chieftain's daughter.

325
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:05,159
No matter how I feel about him,
we cannot be together.

326
00:31:06,837 --> 00:31:10,568
Being rejected because of your heritage
isn't an easy thing.

327
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:14,337
Perhaps you and Riverwind
have something in common after all.

328
00:31:14,444 --> 00:31:17,845
Monks! Monks! Monks! Monks!

329
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:22,315
DMonks? We can handle monks.
DI don't like this.

330
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:29,889
Stay calm. Sturm, you do the talking.

331
00:31:29,993 --> 00:31:33,656
If they're really monks,
they should respect a knight.

332
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:35,856
Greetings, brethren.

333
00:31:35,966 --> 00:31:39,766
Hail, Knight of Solamnia.
Tell me, do you come now from Solace?

334
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,665
We traveled through, yes.

335
00:31:41,772 --> 00:31:44,536
We are seeking
a sacred crystal staff of healing,

336
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:46,871
last seen in Solace. Do you know of it?

337
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,941
One of our brothers is ill.
He'll die without its blessed touch.

338
00:31:51,048 --> 00:31:54,074
DI'm afraid we can't help.
DI bear the Blue Crystal Staff.

339
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:57,745
DI can help you.
DWe are grateful for your aid.

340
00:32:10,801 --> 00:32:12,701
By the gods, what are these things?

341
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:31,110
Don't stab them! They'll turn to stone
and trap your sword.

342
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:32,779
Now, Raist!

343
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,290
Sturm!

344
00:33:51,802 --> 00:33:54,566
My father's sword.

345
00:33:55,639 --> 00:33:57,766
Don't worry. I'll get it.

346
00:33:58,241 --> 00:34:01,233
Stay still. You've lost a lot of blood.

347
00:34:03,647 --> 00:34:05,171
He's dying.

348
00:34:15,926 --> 00:34:17,860
I am in your debt, my lady.

349
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:27,631
Did anyone see that?

350
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:32,006
Tanis, look!
More of those lizardy things!

351
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,369
Hurry! Into the forest!

352
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:38,246
But that's Darken Wood!
It's full of undead!

353
00:34:38,348 --> 00:34:39,838
We've got no choice,

354
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:44,284
unless you want to jump off that cliff
or fight more of those things.

355
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:53,720
I think we lost them.

356
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:07,002
What do you sense?

357
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,637
There is a great and powerful magic
laid on this forest.

358
00:35:10,747 --> 00:35:14,080
DEvil?
DOnly to those with evil intent.

359
00:35:14,184 --> 00:35:18,052
Then you are the only one
who need fear this wood, mage.

360
00:35:22,526 --> 00:35:24,016
Listen.

361
00:35:41,478 --> 00:35:45,744
Sheathe your swords.
Trust me, they won't do you any good.

362
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:48,574
Trust you? I think not.

363
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:53,213
When it comes to the ways of magic,
he knows what he's doing. I hope.

364
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:06,361
You who have been long dead,
use my voice to speak with the living.

365
00:36:15,612 --> 00:36:17,842
Who trespasses in the Darken Wood?

366
00:36:17,948 --> 00:36:22,180
Hello, I'm Tasslehoff Burrfoot.
These are my friends.

367
00:36:22,285 --> 00:36:24,981
If you have entered this wood
with evil intentions,

368
00:36:25,088 --> 00:36:27,921
you will not live to see the moons rise.

369
00:36:28,224 --> 00:36:31,159
No, no, no. You've got it all wrong.
We're on a quest.

370
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:33,923
It all started with this Blue Crystal Staff.
And we...

371
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,497
Blue crystal?

372
00:36:37,834 --> 00:36:40,200
Yeah, and... Hey, wait a second!

373
00:36:43,673 --> 00:36:45,265
Leave her alone!

374
00:36:51,681 --> 00:36:53,945
My hand, it's so cold.

375
00:36:58,888 --> 00:37:00,150
Follow me.

376
00:37:04,594 --> 00:37:05,720
Raist!

377
00:37:08,231 --> 00:37:09,823
DLet's go.
DWait.

378
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:13,596
Raistlin's done some shady things
in his quest for power.

379
00:37:13,703 --> 00:37:16,228
What if he's leading us into a trap?

380
00:37:17,907 --> 00:37:20,501
I don't think we have a choice.

381
00:37:35,925 --> 00:37:37,586
Are you all right?

382
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:40,019
I'm fine.

383
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:45,932
Put aside your fears. Safety exists here,
if it exists anywhere on Krynn.

384
00:37:46,036 --> 00:37:49,130
The draconians will not find this place.

385
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:52,333
Draconians.
So that's what they are called.

386
00:37:54,444 --> 00:37:58,175
Food! Drink! Thank the gods!

387
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,320
Please, come to me,
bearer of the Blue Crystal Staff.

388
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,359
DCan you tell us about the staff?
Dlt's intended for good,

389
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:21,126
to combat injury, illness and disease.

390
00:38:21,237 --> 00:38:24,729
But in these times,
it will also become a weapon

391
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:28,675
against the very evil
that seeks to banish it from the world.

392
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:30,405
Did the staff come
from the Gods of Light?

393
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:31,844
Is it a sign they've returned?

394
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:36,544
That I do not know.
If you wish to find such answers,

395
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:39,053
you must travel
beyond the Eastwall Mountains

396
00:38:39,155 --> 00:38:42,181
to an ancient city, Xak Tsaroth.

397
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:44,783
DWhat'll we find there?
DGreat evil.

398
00:38:44,894 --> 00:38:50,230
But if you prove yourselves worthy,
you will receive the Disks of Mishakal.

399
00:38:51,701 --> 00:38:53,066
The Disks of Mishakal?

400
00:38:53,837 --> 00:38:57,796
Sacred texts lost in the Cataclysm.
They contain the truth of the gods.

401
00:38:57,907 --> 00:39:03,174
If that truth remains hidden, the world
will fall under the shadow of evil

402
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:07,375
and untold number of innocents
will suffer and die.

403
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:08,951
Then we must retrieve the Disks.

404
00:39:09,052 --> 00:39:13,455
Tanis, I appreciate everything
that you have done for us,

405
00:39:13,556 --> 00:39:17,151
Dbut I don't expect you to accompany...
DWe don't need the help of a halfDbreed!

406
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:21,219
DWe'll finish this alone.
DThen you'll die alone.

407
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:26,001
Can I speak to you?

408
00:39:28,738 --> 00:39:31,536
With this rise of evil,
I'm getting worried about Kitiara.

409
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:35,133
I was thinking about looking for her,
but maybe this quest is more important.

410
00:39:35,245 --> 00:39:39,375
Dlf you know something, tell me now.
Dln a vision, I saw an army

411
00:39:39,482 --> 00:39:43,441
overrun Haven, Solace
and the elven lands.

412
00:39:43,553 --> 00:39:47,751
The Disks of Mishakal might be the key
to destroying such a force.

413
00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:50,690
So we should go to Xak Tsaroth?

414
00:39:50,794 --> 00:39:53,024
Do you think we were chosen
for this quest?

415
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:55,256
So my vision leads me to believe.

416
00:39:55,365 --> 00:39:58,732
Why? I can't even sort out my own life.
I'm not a hero.

417
00:39:58,835 --> 00:40:02,669
Then you must become one,
or the world is doomed.

418
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:20,486
They will take you as close
to Xak Tsaroth as they dare.

419
00:40:23,726 --> 00:40:26,024
Horses! Just what I need.

420
00:40:32,702 --> 00:40:36,399
Remember, Goldmoon,
present the staff boldly,

421
00:40:36,506 --> 00:40:39,441
never wavering, and you will prevail.

422
00:40:54,557 --> 00:40:57,048
Dwarves were not meant to fly.

423
00:41:11,374 --> 00:41:13,842
They're too frightened to go on.

424
00:41:13,943 --> 00:41:16,309
We'll have to cross the mountains
to Xak Tsaroth on our own.

425
00:41:16,412 --> 00:41:19,006
DWhere are we?
DThe plains of Abanasinia.

426
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:21,675
DOur village lies to the east.
DNo!

427
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:09,662
Tanis, look here.

428
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:11,828
Who is this Verminaard?

429
00:42:11,935 --> 00:42:15,029
Obviously the one responsible
for this atrocity.

430
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:18,434
On my honor,
I will make him pay for this.

431
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:21,977
I found draconian tracks leading away,
toward Xak Tsaroth.

432
00:42:22,111 --> 00:42:24,375
There's nothing we can do here.

433
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,013
We'll have our revenge when
we get to the city and find the Disks.

434
00:42:37,126 --> 00:42:39,390
The tracks go this way.

435
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:54,776
How beautiful.

436
00:42:55,445 --> 00:42:57,640
A temple to the Gods of Light.

437
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:06,787
Gully dwarves!

438
00:43:07,623 --> 00:43:11,684
The stupidest, most vile creatures
that I ever...

439
00:43:11,794 --> 00:43:13,352
Look! Draconians!

440
00:43:15,798 --> 00:43:16,992
Hide!

441
00:43:33,649 --> 00:43:37,050
This is a big city. There could be
hundreds of those things.

442
00:43:37,253 --> 00:43:40,518
How are we gonna search for the Disks
without getting spotted?

443
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:42,591
We need an ally who knows the city,

444
00:43:42,692 --> 00:43:46,093
one who can help us avoid the patrols
and lead us to the Disks.

445
00:43:47,263 --> 00:43:51,256
And where do you propose
we find such an ally, mage?

446
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:54,063
We don't find one. We make one.

447
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,503
Hello, little one.

448
00:44:04,113 --> 00:44:06,104
You make me lose dinner!

449
00:44:13,156 --> 00:44:15,590
It's safe. You can come out now.

450
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:19,492
DWhat did you do to her?
DA spell of friendship.

451
00:44:20,129 --> 00:44:22,859
It looks like you overdid it a little.

452
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:27,229
DMeet our new ally.
DBupu! Good to meet!

453
00:44:36,145 --> 00:44:38,045
All treasure in city here.

454
00:44:38,147 --> 00:44:40,615
And the draconians
don't know about this passage?

455
00:44:40,716 --> 00:44:42,411
No, bosses. Secret.

456
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,245
DHere. Locked.
DAIIow me.

457
00:44:52,762 --> 00:44:57,461
DNo want to wake her.
DBy the gods, a dragon.

458
00:45:02,638 --> 00:45:03,832
Come on.

459
00:45:16,385 --> 00:45:18,876
Look for a book with a dark cover,

460
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:25,553
Dstamped with runes of silver.
DYes. Find for you.

461
00:45:25,661 --> 00:45:28,926
So that's why you wanted to come here.
For a spell book.

462
00:45:29,031 --> 00:45:31,226
It could help us
in our fight against the evil army.

463
00:45:31,334 --> 00:45:34,132
Don't give me that.
You want its power for yourself.

464
00:45:34,237 --> 00:45:36,535
Don't point fingers, Tanis.

465
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,631
You seek the gods for one reason,
because you think

466
00:45:39,742 --> 00:45:42,836
they can resolve the war
between your elven and human halves

467
00:45:42,945 --> 00:45:44,572
before it tears you apart!

468
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,171
I don't need a lecture
from someone who's willing to endanger

469
00:45:47,283 --> 00:45:52,243
the lives of his friends, even
his own brother, to get what he wants.

470
00:45:52,355 --> 00:45:54,118
I think I found them.

471
00:45:59,295 --> 00:46:01,092
The Disks of Mishakal.

472
00:46:14,043 --> 00:46:15,476
Let him go!

473
00:46:23,419 --> 00:46:29,153
DYou destroyed my village.
DOne step closer and the mage dies.

474
00:46:29,258 --> 00:46:33,490
Bring me the Blue Crystal Staff,
lady of the QuéDShu.

475
00:46:33,596 --> 00:46:39,899
Obey me,
or I will kill your friends, one by one,

476
00:46:40,002 --> 00:46:44,803
until you alone
are left begging for mercy.

477
00:46:45,508 --> 00:46:47,169
I know what I must do.

478
00:46:47,276 --> 00:46:50,336
If you believe in the gods,
you must trust them, and me.

479
00:46:50,446 --> 00:46:53,210
Don't let Riverwind stop me.

480
00:46:53,382 --> 00:46:56,044
DGoldmoon!
DShe knows what she's doing.

481
00:46:56,152 --> 00:47:02,819
Good, you know your place.
Now, lay the staff down before me.

482
00:47:03,626 --> 00:47:05,093
As you wish.

483
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:21,706
Go! Save the Disks!

484
00:47:30,786 --> 00:47:33,914
Goldmoon! No!

485
00:47:36,158 --> 00:47:38,251
This is your fault, halfDelf.

486
00:47:38,828 --> 00:47:40,819
I could've stopped her.

487
00:47:41,897 --> 00:47:45,697
We have to get out of here!
Back through the secret passage!

488
00:47:54,243 --> 00:47:57,269
Riverwind, you'll be killed if you stay!

489
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,645
DTanis, come on!
DGo! I'm right behind you.

490
00:48:25,207 --> 00:48:30,645
DTanis went back for Riverwind.
DBy the gods, they're dead.

491
00:48:47,363 --> 00:48:51,129
DWhat happened?
DThe plainsman saved you.

492
00:48:51,233 --> 00:48:53,133
DThe Disks?
DHere.

493
00:48:53,235 --> 00:48:55,533
But there's a problem.
We cannot decipher them.

494
00:48:55,638 --> 00:48:58,198
They're written in a language
I've never seen.

495
00:48:58,307 --> 00:49:01,071
So that's it? Goldmoon died for nothing?

496
00:49:05,881 --> 00:49:09,078
You know,
I'm really getting sick of these guys!

497
00:49:17,727 --> 00:49:21,288
We should leave the city
before we run into more of them.

498
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,368
I go with you, but will miss my tribe.

499
00:49:27,503 --> 00:49:29,698
Bupu, you have been
a good and true friend,

500
00:49:29,805 --> 00:49:32,433
but I have to travel down a dark
and dangerous road.

501
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:36,875
DI can't ask you to go with me.
DBut you be sad without Bupu.

502
00:49:36,979 --> 00:49:39,209
I'll be happy knowing
you're back with your people.

503
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:40,839
DYou sure?
DI'm sure.

504
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:44,579
Then I go. First, take present.

505
00:49:44,954 --> 00:49:48,082
DThe Spellbook of Fistandantilus.
DYou like?

506
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:52,684
Yes, little one. I like. Thank you.

507
00:49:55,064 --> 00:49:56,554
Farewell, Bupu.

508
00:50:04,173 --> 00:50:05,936
It's not your fault, Tanis.

509
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:10,535
DI let her sacrifice herself for nothing.
DShe acted out of faith.

510
00:50:10,646 --> 00:50:12,136
Then I know who's to blame!

511
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:18,011
What kind of gods are you
that you demand a human sacrifice?

512
00:50:19,388 --> 00:50:21,481
I wanted to believe in you!

513
00:50:22,391 --> 00:50:26,487
Well, we don't need you!
I don't need you.

514
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:31,598
Goldmoon?

515
00:50:31,901 --> 00:50:36,338
Tanis, I told you, faith is the answer.

516
00:50:41,577 --> 00:50:44,944
Goldmoon, you're alive.

517
00:50:48,017 --> 00:50:50,315
I never should've doubted.

518
00:50:50,419 --> 00:50:53,149
If you're still alive,
what about the dragon?

519
00:50:53,255 --> 00:50:58,955
The dragon? Destroyed. Only through
my faith in Mishakal have I been reborn,

520
00:50:59,061 --> 00:51:02,588
and she's made me a true cleric
with the gift of healing.

521
00:51:09,104 --> 00:51:13,598
Mishakal, heal this man
who has served you so well.

522
00:51:17,613 --> 00:51:20,912
She can heal without the staff.

523
00:51:21,016 --> 00:51:25,453
That hasn't happened
since the gods left 300 years ago.

524
00:51:25,588 --> 00:51:29,319
The gods didn't leave us.
We turned away from the gods.

525
00:51:29,425 --> 00:51:33,794
And, hey, she cast that spell
without using those funny words.

526
00:51:33,896 --> 00:51:36,922
Why can't you do that,
allDpowerful mage?

527
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:39,927
She's channeling
the power of a god, you dolt.

528
00:51:40,035 --> 00:51:43,095
I'm wresting arcane energies
from the very fabric of the universe.

529
00:51:43,205 --> 00:51:47,665
Dlt's completely different.
DMy lady, the Disks of Mishakal.

530
00:51:47,776 --> 00:51:50,142
Even Raist couldn't read them.
Can you?

531
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:56,142
No, but Mishakal tells me
there is one who can.

532
00:51:56,252 --> 00:51:58,482
One with the strength and wisdom
to unite the world

533
00:51:58,587 --> 00:52:00,885
against the forces of evil.

534
00:52:02,224 --> 00:52:07,753
DThe armies! War has begun.
DWe must return to Solace quickly.

535
00:52:07,897 --> 00:52:11,424
There we will find
the great leader we are seeking.

536
00:52:28,951 --> 00:52:31,146
Seems you found
the proof you've been looking for.

537
00:52:31,253 --> 00:52:34,279
Only a real miracle
could've brought Goldmoon back.

538
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:37,917
I thought I'd feel different somehow,
but I feel the same.

539
00:52:38,227 --> 00:52:41,492
Well, then maybe the problem's
never been up there.

540
00:52:41,697 --> 00:52:44,723
Maybe it's always been in here.

541
00:52:44,934 --> 00:52:48,529
I heard that. I heard people start
to lose their minds when they get old.

542
00:52:48,637 --> 00:52:51,071
Not my head, your head!

543
00:52:52,207 --> 00:52:56,337
I'm just saying that maybe
what you've been really searching for

544
00:52:56,445 --> 00:52:58,436
is faith in yourself.

545
00:53:00,716 --> 00:53:01,842
Solace!

546
00:53:11,527 --> 00:53:17,397
DChaos. War. Death.
DWelcome home!

547
00:53:19,168 --> 00:53:23,468
Move and I'll kill the kender.

548
00:53:23,572 --> 00:53:25,802
Disarm them and take their gear.

549
00:53:35,517 --> 00:53:40,079
We can't let them have the Disks.
If they realize what they are...

550
00:53:40,189 --> 00:53:45,286
It'll be all right.
I have cast a spell upon our belongings.

551
00:53:45,394 --> 00:53:47,919
Any who touch them
faces a hideous death,

552
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:52,729
painfully devoured
by the great worm Catyrpelius!

553
00:53:52,835 --> 00:53:55,269
I've never heard of that spell.

554
00:53:56,405 --> 00:53:58,498
Put them in the wagons.

555
00:54:03,145 --> 00:54:04,737
Where are you taking us?

556
00:54:04,847 --> 00:54:07,577
To Verminaard's slave mines
in Pax Tharkas.

557
00:54:08,283 --> 00:54:14,017
My lord will be pleased
to have slaves of your caliber.

558
00:54:25,934 --> 00:54:27,231
Caramon?

559
00:54:28,671 --> 00:54:30,070
Tanthalas?

560
00:54:30,172 --> 00:54:34,302
I almost didn't recognize you
with that beard. You look human.

561
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,900
DTanthalas?
DMy elven name.

562
00:54:36,011 --> 00:54:38,878
This is Gilthanas, my cousin.

563
00:54:43,952 --> 00:54:45,249
Theros!

564
00:54:45,354 --> 00:54:48,050
He was helping the elves escape
Verminaard's genocide.

565
00:54:48,323 --> 00:54:50,450
He now pays for his loyalty with his life.

566
00:54:51,226 --> 00:54:54,957
DI'm a healer. He needn't die.
DAway!

567
00:54:55,064 --> 00:54:58,158
Let him die in peace
without any of your barbarian rituals.

568
00:54:58,267 --> 00:55:01,964
DGilthanas, she's a true cleric.
DThat's impossible.

569
00:55:02,171 --> 00:55:07,302
Mishakal, grace this man
with your blessing.

570
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:10,606
If his destiny be not yet fulfilled,
heal him,

571
00:55:10,713 --> 00:55:14,376
so he may live
and serve the cause of truth.

572
00:55:19,855 --> 00:55:24,758
DWhoa. We're moving.
DGilthanas, what happened here?

573
00:55:25,127 --> 00:55:27,288
Dragons.

574
00:55:42,678 --> 00:55:45,704
Red dragons? We fought
a black dragon in Xak Tsaroth.

575
00:55:45,814 --> 00:55:47,645
Dragons, you say?

576
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:51,277
Hey, you're that crazy storyteller
from the inn.

577
00:55:51,386 --> 00:55:56,346
Yes, the name's Fla... Forb...
Fizban! That's it.

578
00:55:56,458 --> 00:55:58,050
That's not a name.

579
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,392
It's not? That's too bad.
I was rather fond of it.

580
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:08,634
DYou know something of dragons?
DDragons? Where? Oh, yes, dragons.

581
00:56:08,737 --> 00:56:12,468
Long ago there were countless dragons
in the world.

582
00:56:12,574 --> 00:56:17,068
They were a nightmare to behold
and they dominated the lands.

583
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:18,874
What happened to them?

584
00:56:18,981 --> 00:56:23,748
The Gods of Light bestowed a gift
upon the good people of the world.

585
00:56:23,852 --> 00:56:28,312
The dragonlances.
They had the power to destroy dragons.

586
00:56:28,423 --> 00:56:32,883
But that was long ago,
and the dragonlances have been lost.

587
00:56:32,995 --> 00:56:36,431
Now it seems
the dragons have returned.

588
00:56:38,534 --> 00:56:41,503
I saw you heal that man.
Can you help my daughter?

589
00:56:42,137 --> 00:56:43,468
Brinna!

590
00:56:46,275 --> 00:56:51,008
Mishakal, please heal this child
if it is her destiny.

591
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:55,277
Thank you. It doesn't hurt anymore.

592
00:56:59,254 --> 00:57:01,154
Her injuries were too great.

593
00:57:03,492 --> 00:57:06,928
You couldn't save her. I guess
even Mishakal isn't strong enough.

594
00:57:07,029 --> 00:57:11,261
No, I'm not strong enough.
In the past there were clerics so faithful

595
00:57:11,366 --> 00:57:14,335
that they could channel the magic
of the gods to bring back the dead.

596
00:57:14,436 --> 00:57:17,735
Now only the Disks of Mishakal
can return that power to the world.

597
00:57:38,293 --> 00:57:40,818
Finally, Porthios and his archers!

598
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:50,968
DThis is our chance to escape.
DHow? They took my lock picks.

599
00:57:51,073 --> 00:57:53,667
Where are the gods
when you need them?

600
00:57:53,775 --> 00:57:57,108
Here, let me. Knock!

601
00:57:59,047 --> 00:58:02,642
DMagic? Why didn't you do that before?
DNo one asked me to.

602
00:58:02,751 --> 00:58:05,049
The prisoners are escaping!

603
00:58:05,487 --> 00:58:08,479
DWe need a diversion.
DComing right up.

604
00:58:09,224 --> 00:58:11,920
Now, let's see. What's that called?

605
00:58:13,595 --> 00:58:16,086
Oh, yes. Fireball!

606
00:58:23,505 --> 00:58:26,338
DWe must retrieve the Disks!
DOver there!

607
00:58:26,441 --> 00:58:28,705
Tas, get your lock picks
and free the other prisoners.

608
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:31,904
Everyone else, grab what you can.
Hurry!

609
00:59:03,412 --> 00:59:04,743
Porthios, thank you for...

610
00:59:04,846 --> 00:59:07,314
NonDelves are not allowed here,
Tanthalas.

611
00:59:07,516 --> 00:59:10,508
I suggest you flee from this area
as fast as you can.

612
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:12,143
These people need your help.

613
00:59:13,188 --> 00:59:15,349
It is enough that we have freed them,
human.

614
00:59:15,457 --> 00:59:18,915
DWe elves have our own problems.
DTanis?

615
00:59:19,027 --> 00:59:22,793
You will take everyone into Qualinesti
and provide for the refugees.

616
00:59:22,898 --> 00:59:24,763
We will do nothing of the kind.

617
00:59:24,866 --> 00:59:27,630
Humans caused the gods
to turn their backs on the world.

618
00:59:27,736 --> 00:59:31,001
You're wrong! The gods never left.
I'm one of their clerics.

619
00:59:31,106 --> 00:59:33,768
I saw her heal a man
who should've died.

620
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:36,571
The Speaker of the Suns may wish
to see this for himself.

621
00:59:36,678 --> 00:59:39,943
I saw her come back from the dead
by the power of the Gods of Light.

622
00:59:40,048 --> 00:59:42,016
Perhaps Gilthanas is right.

623
00:59:42,117 --> 00:59:44,813
The Speaker will want to investigate
this claim.

624
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,823
DYou will be our honored guests.
DMore like honored prisoners.

625
00:59:57,733 --> 01:00:01,931
DYou seem to know many of these elves.
DI was born here in Qualinesti.

626
01:00:02,104 --> 01:00:04,072
And you're not welcome
in the land of your birth?

627
01:00:04,172 --> 01:00:06,970
A human killed my mother's husband
and then raped her.

628
01:00:07,075 --> 01:00:10,567
She died in childbirth. A human father
makes me only halfDelven.

629
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:12,647
The elves could never accept me,
so I left.

630
01:00:12,748 --> 01:00:14,978
I understand what it's like
to be an outcast,

631
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:18,314
but no matter what,
you have to believe in yourself.

632
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,412
Of course,
my village stoned me for my beliefs.

633
01:00:46,348 --> 01:00:49,078
Rest here while I report to the Speaker.

634
01:00:49,785 --> 01:00:51,946
Food! Finally!

635
01:01:06,168 --> 01:01:07,658
Tanthalas!

636
01:01:12,707 --> 01:01:14,902
Laurana, someone might see us.

637
01:01:15,243 --> 01:01:20,180
I can't believe you're back. I guess you
heard the elves are leaving Qualinesti.

638
01:01:20,282 --> 01:01:23,513
DThey are? Why?
DLaurana!

639
01:01:23,618 --> 01:01:27,145
I've got a lot to do. I'll see you later.

640
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:39,826
I bid you welcome, Tanthalas,
son of my brother's wife.

641
01:01:39,935 --> 01:01:42,460
Greetings, Speaker.
I'm called Tanis now.

642
01:01:42,571 --> 01:01:46,007
You deny your elven heritage
by taking a human name?

643
01:01:46,108 --> 01:01:48,303
Your mother would be appalled.

644
01:01:49,744 --> 01:01:53,202
It is you, woman of the plains,
who concerns me most.

645
01:01:53,315 --> 01:01:56,580
You claim to have healed this man,
Theros Ironfeld?

646
01:01:57,419 --> 01:01:59,410
Your son Gilthanas saw me heal him.

647
01:01:59,654 --> 01:02:03,420
He was overwrought and may
have mistaken witchcraft for healing.

648
01:02:03,525 --> 01:02:06,551
She is a healer,
a true cleric of the Gods of Light.

649
01:02:06,661 --> 01:02:09,152
DWhy should I believe you?
DLook on this.

650
01:02:10,332 --> 01:02:12,061
Blasphemy!

651
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:22,100
Stop this nonsense!

652
01:02:28,483 --> 01:02:29,882
Who are you?

653
01:02:30,652 --> 01:02:32,517
DWhat was that name?
DFizban.

654
01:02:32,621 --> 01:02:37,718
DBut like I said, it's not really a name.
DSolostaran, call off your guard.

655
01:02:46,101 --> 01:02:49,468
If the Gods of Light have truly returned,

656
01:02:49,571 --> 01:02:53,564
then perhaps there is hope
some of us will survive.

657
01:02:53,675 --> 01:02:57,167
DWhat are you talking about?
DSee for yourselves.

658
01:03:01,049 --> 01:03:02,778
There's Solace!

659
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:08,012
DWhat are those?
DArmies of dragons and draconians

660
01:03:08,123 --> 01:03:11,058
brought to this world
by the evil goddess, Takhisis.

661
01:03:12,327 --> 01:03:16,787
Even now, there at Pax Tharkas,
High Dragonlord Verminaard

662
01:03:16,898 --> 01:03:19,799
gathers his forces
to invade our homeland.

663
01:03:19,901 --> 01:03:23,337
Verminaard.
He murdered everyone in our village.

664
01:03:23,505 --> 01:03:26,099
He has declared his intention
to wipe out the elves, as well.

665
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:28,335
But surely this city is easily defended?

666
01:03:28,443 --> 01:03:31,810
Without the dragonlances,
we cannot withstand armies of dragons.

667
01:03:32,581 --> 01:03:36,142
We must abandon our lands and flee.

668
01:03:37,385 --> 01:03:39,979
Even so, the dragon horde
moves far more swiftly

669
01:03:40,088 --> 01:03:42,249
than we can
with our women and children.

670
01:03:42,357 --> 01:03:45,815
DWe may still be overtaken.
DSo we're too late.

671
01:03:46,127 --> 01:03:47,492
Takhisis has already won.

672
01:03:48,763 --> 01:03:50,890
No, there is a chance.

673
01:03:50,999 --> 01:03:54,457
If you and your companions
can delay Verminaard's forces,

674
01:03:54,569 --> 01:03:57,470
we can reach the sea before they arrive.

675
01:04:00,141 --> 01:04:02,405
How can we stop an entire army?

676
01:04:02,677 --> 01:04:07,478
Infiltrate the mines at Pax Tharkas
and incite a rebellion among the slaves.

677
01:04:07,582 --> 01:04:09,379
That should divert
Verminaard's attention.

678
01:04:09,484 --> 01:04:12,009
Why haven't you already
sent elves on this mission?

679
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:15,556
The slaves are humans.
They will not listen to an elf,

680
01:04:15,657 --> 01:04:18,125
but they may listen to you.

681
01:04:18,226 --> 01:04:22,629
Besides, this will give you a chance
to rescue more of your human brethren.

682
01:04:22,731 --> 01:04:25,325
But Pax Tharkas is a fortified citadel.

683
01:04:25,433 --> 01:04:27,924
We'd never even make it
through the gates.

684
01:04:28,036 --> 01:04:32,439
Gilthanas knows a secret way
into the fortress. He will guide you.

685
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:33,939
I don't know.

686
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:38,638
We're on a quest to find a leader who
will unite the world against Takhisis.

687
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:55,592
Please... Tanis,
my people will be destroyed.

688
01:04:55,697 --> 01:04:58,222
Help me save them.

689
01:04:58,333 --> 01:05:02,269
I know your choice is difficult,
but you must decide quickly.

690
01:05:07,242 --> 01:05:11,008
Almighty Paladine,
if you're listening, I need guidance.

691
01:05:11,112 --> 01:05:14,707
I want to be the hero you wish me to be,
but I'm afraid.

692
01:05:14,816 --> 01:05:17,614
As the world falls underneath
the shadow of Takhisis,

693
01:05:17,786 --> 01:05:21,984
I find myself filled with doubt.
I know what I have to do.

694
01:05:22,223 --> 01:05:25,056
I just don't know if my faith
is strong enough.

695
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:28,960
Tanthalas,
please don't throw your life away.

696
01:05:29,064 --> 01:05:30,929
Come away with us,
where you'll be safe.

697
01:05:31,032 --> 01:05:34,195
There comes a time when you have to
risk your life for what you believe in.

698
01:05:34,302 --> 01:05:36,770
Leave with me,
and we can finally be married.

699
01:05:36,871 --> 01:05:38,736
I'm sure my father would perform the...

700
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,173
Your father once said I was
half of one thing and all of nothing.

701
01:05:42,277 --> 01:05:45,872
DHe'll never agree to our marriage.
DOf course he will.

702
01:05:46,481 --> 01:05:50,144
Gilthanas was my best friend
and even he turned against me

703
01:05:50,251 --> 01:05:53,846
when he found out about us.
The elves have no love for me.

704
01:05:53,955 --> 01:05:56,082
They'll learn to love you
as much as I do.

705
01:05:56,191 --> 01:05:58,557
You're still so naive.

706
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,652
DBut, Tanthalas, I...
DDon't call me that!

707
01:06:02,464 --> 01:06:06,628
And stop trying to convince me
of something that'll never be true.

708
01:06:07,702 --> 01:06:09,226
It's over.

709
01:06:09,337 --> 01:06:11,601
I've fallen in love
with a human woman, Kitiara.

710
01:06:11,706 --> 01:06:14,197
With her, I'm accepted for who I am.

711
01:06:26,821 --> 01:06:30,882
We have just received word that
Onyx was defeated at Xak Tsaroth.

712
01:06:30,992 --> 01:06:33,961
DAnd the Disks?
DTaken.

713
01:06:34,062 --> 01:06:38,499
Then we must finish this
before the Gods of Light can interfere.

714
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:43,196
By nightfall,
I want the elven stronghold destroyed.

715
01:06:44,072 --> 01:06:45,699
Yes, my lord.

716
01:06:51,346 --> 01:06:54,042
The elves are my kin, no matter
how much they try to deny me.

717
01:06:54,315 --> 01:06:57,978
I'm going to Pax Tharkas alone.
Take the Disks and leave with the elves.

718
01:06:58,553 --> 01:07:02,148
The human slaves are
in as much danger as the elves.

719
01:07:02,257 --> 01:07:04,282
It is my duty to rescue them.

720
01:07:04,726 --> 01:07:07,456
I believe the one I seek
may also be among the slaves.

721
01:07:08,363 --> 01:07:11,594
Your quest is mine. I go where you go.

722
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:14,691
Hey, there's no way you're leaving me
with all these elves!

723
01:07:14,803 --> 01:07:21,208
Accept the inevitable, Tanis. For good
or ill, we face this mission together.

724
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:26,206
DDon't forget me.
DNo. You're going with the elves.

725
01:07:26,314 --> 01:07:32,116
I go where I choose, and I choose
to go with you, Tanis HalfDEIven.

726
01:07:33,521 --> 01:07:35,079
Then we leave within the hour.

727
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:38,990
This is gonna be fun!
I've never fought a whole army before.

728
01:08:14,128 --> 01:08:16,756
The SlaDMori. The Secret Way.

729
01:08:26,207 --> 01:08:27,799
All right, everyone know the plan?

730
01:08:27,909 --> 01:08:30,537
Find the slaves and send the women
and children back out this way,

731
01:08:30,678 --> 01:08:32,669
while we and the men
keep the draconians busy.

732
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,908
That should give the elves
enough time to escape.

733
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:40,310
What in the name of the Abyss
are you doing here?

734
01:08:40,421 --> 01:08:44,619
You said you were risking your life for
something you believe in, and so am I.

735
01:08:44,726 --> 01:08:47,286
You're going back to the elves.

736
01:08:50,431 --> 01:08:51,864
You can't let her go alone.

737
01:08:51,966 --> 01:08:56,130
If she's captured, she might alert
the draconians to our plan.

738
01:08:56,237 --> 01:08:58,705
All right, but stay out of the way.

739
01:09:02,243 --> 01:09:04,143
It's dark in there.

740
01:09:04,245 --> 01:09:09,740
I can take care of that. Into the tunnel.

741
01:09:09,851 --> 01:09:14,845
I mean it. Get inside that tunnel now.
Don't make me get your father.

742
01:09:16,491 --> 01:09:19,949
Everyone remember how to get
back here. It's our only way out.

743
01:09:27,669 --> 01:09:30,399
The gate's open.
Why don't they escape?

744
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:35,903
We're here to rescue you.
Hurry, before the draconians...

745
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:37,068
You!

746
01:09:37,178 --> 01:09:40,011
You're the witch
that caused the attack on Solace!

747
01:09:40,114 --> 01:09:42,674
It's because of you that we're all here!

748
01:09:42,784 --> 01:09:46,083
This is your fault!
My wife is dead because of you!

749
01:09:46,187 --> 01:09:48,553
Verminaard is the one
who took your wife from you,

750
01:09:48,656 --> 01:09:53,423
as he took my family from me.
I'm not a witch. I'm a cleric of Mishakal.

751
01:09:53,528 --> 01:09:56,554
DWhy should we believe you?
DThis man is dying.

752
01:09:56,664 --> 01:09:59,132
If you're really a cleric,
you can save him.

753
01:10:08,209 --> 01:10:13,806
Mishakal, if it be your will, cleanse
the disease from this man's body.

754
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:35,626
Thank you.
I'm Elistan, the leader of these people.

755
01:10:35,737 --> 01:10:37,466
We need to get all of you out of here.

756
01:10:37,572 --> 01:10:41,941
No. Verminaard's placed our children
under the guard of a dragon.

757
01:10:42,043 --> 01:10:44,705
If we try to leave, they'll be killed.

758
01:10:44,812 --> 01:10:49,044
That's why they don't try to escape
even though the cell is unlocked.

759
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:51,311
Then we'll have to rescue the children
from the dragon.

760
01:10:51,419 --> 01:10:55,788
No, we can't face a dragon.
You saw what they did to Solace.

761
01:10:55,890 --> 01:11:00,793
Don't worry, Tika. We've faced
a dragon before. We can handle it.

762
01:11:01,462 --> 01:11:04,989
The way to the dragon's lair
is guarded by draconians.

763
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:08,125
If we have to fight the draconians,
the dragon will surely hear us

764
01:11:08,236 --> 01:11:10,704
and slay the children
before we can free them.

765
01:11:10,805 --> 01:11:13,774
There must be a way to get past
the draconians without a fight.

766
01:11:14,575 --> 01:11:18,170
I have an idea,
but you're not gonna like it.

767
01:11:19,981 --> 01:11:23,439
I want to make one thing clear.
This never happened.

768
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:25,815
You're early this morning.

769
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:32,786
DThe children need their exercise.
DI'd love to give you some exercise.

770
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:39,364
Steady.

771
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:46,362
But Verminaard's got us pulling
doubleDduty with the army marching out.

772
01:11:46,474 --> 01:11:48,066
Maybe later.

773
01:12:00,521 --> 01:12:04,719
I've never seen
an uglier woman in my life.

774
01:12:09,697 --> 01:12:12,029
Who is it?

775
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,793
We're here to take the children
for their exercise.

776
01:12:14,902 --> 01:12:19,396
The little ones had a restful night.
Keep an eye on little Erik.

777
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:23,743
I think he's getting a cold.

778
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:27,111
This dragon is halfDblind and insane.

779
01:12:27,215 --> 01:12:28,842
This is going to be easier
than I thought.

780
01:12:28,983 --> 01:12:32,817
We'll watch out for him.
Come along, children. Come on.

781
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,118
Where are you going?
The courtyard is the other way.

782
01:12:37,225 --> 01:12:40,194
They're getting a special treat today,
courtesy of Verminaard.

783
01:12:40,328 --> 01:12:42,819
We're taking them to the roof
to look at the mountains.

784
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:45,956
Well, be careful they don't fall off.

785
01:12:46,067 --> 01:12:49,696
My children's wings
haven't grown in yet.

786
01:12:49,804 --> 01:12:53,763
DShe thinks they're her own offspring.
DWe'll keep them safe.

787
01:13:03,651 --> 01:13:06,347
Is anyone willing to stay and fight?

788
01:13:08,923 --> 01:13:10,720
A good number,
but they want to make sure

789
01:13:10,825 --> 01:13:12,452
the women and children
are out of the fortress

790
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,255
before they turn against Verminaard.

791
01:13:14,362 --> 01:13:18,298
Then we should get back to
the secret tunnel as soon as possible.

792
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:46,722
DDraconians. They found the tunnel.
DBut that's our only way out.

793
01:13:46,828 --> 01:13:48,295
Except for the main gate.

794
01:13:48,396 --> 01:13:53,060
You mean where
the entire draconian army is gathering?

795
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:57,536
They're too busy getting ready for war.
We can sneak right past them.

796
01:13:57,638 --> 01:14:00,072
Dlt's too dangerous.
DWe're trapped like rats.

797
01:14:00,174 --> 01:14:02,233
Tanis, what should we do?

798
01:14:03,845 --> 01:14:07,645
DI don't know.
DNow hold on just one second.

799
01:14:07,748 --> 01:14:08,976
You can't give up now.

800
01:14:09,083 --> 01:14:11,574
But there's no way
we can make it out of here alive.

801
01:14:11,686 --> 01:14:13,620
If the gods did return,
they've abandoned us

802
01:14:13,721 --> 01:14:14,915
when we need them the most.

803
01:14:15,022 --> 01:14:20,153
Wasn't it your faith in each other and in
the Gods of Light that got you this far?

804
01:14:20,528 --> 01:14:23,622
Faith is your greatest weapon
against Takhisis.

805
01:14:23,731 --> 01:14:26,791
Embrace it
and you'll become beacons of light

806
01:14:26,901 --> 01:14:30,803
Dto lead the slaves out of darkness.
DI don't know if I can!

807
01:14:30,905 --> 01:14:34,102
It's because you doubt that you fail.

808
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:37,974
You're the only hope for these people
and for the elves.

809
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:41,742
Hold on to your faith,
even in the moment of death,

810
01:14:41,849 --> 01:14:44,613
and the Gods of Light
will come to your aid.

811
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,951
But if you waver,
the Queen of Darkness will prevail.

812
01:15:23,591 --> 01:15:25,923
This is our chance,
but we have to move fast.

813
01:15:41,876 --> 01:15:46,074
Shut the gate!
The slaves are escaping! Verminaard!

814
01:15:55,022 --> 01:15:56,546
Verminaard.

815
01:16:01,562 --> 01:16:07,091
I offered you a chance to work for
the further glory of my queen,

816
01:16:07,201 --> 01:16:11,968
but you have denied her,
and now you will pay with your lives!

817
01:16:12,073 --> 01:16:13,631
Let the children go!

818
01:16:13,741 --> 01:16:18,678
I will destroy the men,
the women and the children!

819
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:44,771
Excellent, Lord Verminaard.
Kill them all.

820
01:16:44,939 --> 01:16:47,373
Are there any you can still save?

821
01:16:47,475 --> 01:16:50,035
DNo, they're already dead.
DWe can't just stand here!

822
01:16:50,144 --> 01:16:53,705
DBut how can we fight a dragon?
DWith another dragon.

823
01:16:58,352 --> 01:17:01,913
Verminaard's killing your children!
You have to stop him!

824
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:07,821
Destroy them all!

825
01:17:17,571 --> 01:17:18,560
Where are you going?

826
01:17:18,672 --> 01:17:21,038
Stand back.
I'm going to blast open the gate.

827
01:17:21,842 --> 01:17:27,041
Now, what's the name of that spell?
FurDsomething...

828
01:17:27,948 --> 01:17:32,214
Firs, Foof, Fireball. Fireball!

829
01:17:32,553 --> 01:17:35,420
DRight.
DEveryone get down!

830
01:17:35,856 --> 01:17:37,323
Fireball!

831
01:17:46,901 --> 01:17:48,266
Fizban!

832
01:17:51,539 --> 01:17:53,029
Feather!

833
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:14,090
The gate! Goldmoon, Riverwind, Flint,
lead the slaves out.

834
01:18:14,195 --> 01:18:15,890
Take Laurana and Tika with you.

835
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:18,497
DThe rest of us will hold off Verminaard.
DBut, Tanis...

836
01:18:18,599 --> 01:18:21,227
Go! You have to protect the slaves
and the Disks.

837
01:18:21,335 --> 01:18:23,303
Good luck, my friend.

838
01:18:23,571 --> 01:18:26,005
DMay the gods be with you.
DFollow us!

839
01:18:45,292 --> 01:18:47,726
Be careful. He's a cleric of Takhisis.

840
01:18:47,828 --> 01:18:51,764
Just as Goldmoon can call upon
Mishakal for the power of healing,

841
01:18:51,899 --> 01:18:54,993
he can call upon Takhisis
for the power of death.

842
01:18:55,102 --> 01:19:00,062
Surrender your weapons and I will ask
the Dark Queen to spare your lives.

843
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:02,434
Takhisis, destroy!

844
01:19:02,843 --> 01:19:04,105
Die!

845
01:19:07,214 --> 01:19:08,545
No!

846
01:19:09,817 --> 01:19:11,341
Midnight!

847
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:14,476
I can't see!

848
01:19:15,356 --> 01:19:17,187
Tanis, help me!

849
01:19:26,734 --> 01:19:28,031
Hold!

850
01:20:13,414 --> 01:20:18,010
DFools! You'll never escape.
DThe Gods of Light have returned

851
01:20:18,118 --> 01:20:20,882
to destroy you and your queen,
Verminaard.

852
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:24,185
Look around you, halfDelf.
What evidence do you see

853
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:27,522
that the Gods of Light
have come back to the world?

854
01:20:27,628 --> 01:20:30,290
Your gods can't save anyone.

855
01:20:30,731 --> 01:20:35,327
Your faith is misplaced.
And now innocent children will die for it.

856
01:20:35,469 --> 01:20:37,596
No!

857
01:20:46,547 --> 01:20:48,071
Midnight!

858
01:20:52,519 --> 01:20:55,352
I can't fight them off any longer.

859
01:20:55,556 --> 01:20:58,286
Perhaps everyone's right.
You are too old for this.

860
01:20:58,559 --> 01:21:02,552
I am not old!

861
01:21:10,037 --> 01:21:12,005
Slay him, my servant.

862
01:21:13,107 --> 01:21:15,974
You'll never win.
The Gods of Light will...

863
01:21:16,076 --> 01:21:19,603
The prophecy is broken.
Nothing can stop the Dark Queen.

864
01:21:19,713 --> 01:21:24,650
She will rule the world
and all will bow before her.

865
01:21:24,752 --> 01:21:27,585
DNo.
DEven now you know it's true.

866
01:21:27,688 --> 01:21:30,657
I can sense it. You doubt your gods.

867
01:21:32,593 --> 01:21:34,561
Paladine, where are you?

868
01:21:34,728 --> 01:21:38,255
Takhisis is real.
You can see her power for yourself.

869
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,899
Commit yourself fully to her,
and I will spare your life.

870
01:21:43,003 --> 01:21:46,404
DNo. Never!
DThen you will die.

871
01:21:46,507 --> 01:21:49,670
You can kill me, Verminaard,
but that won't change anything.

872
01:21:49,843 --> 01:21:51,811
The Gods of Light have returned.

873
01:21:51,912 --> 01:21:55,712
The people will unite
under their banner to destroy Takhisis!

874
01:22:10,331 --> 01:22:14,961
Paladine? But the prophecy is broken!
How could you have returned?

875
01:22:15,069 --> 01:22:17,299
Unwavering faith.

876
01:22:29,783 --> 01:22:33,241
You thought your victory was inevitable,
but you were wrong.

877
01:22:33,354 --> 01:22:36,551
The world will rise up against you.

878
01:22:51,105 --> 01:22:56,805
You may have interfered with my plans
for the moment, Paladine,

879
01:22:57,044 --> 01:23:03,347
but the world will be mine.
I promise you!

880
01:23:45,325 --> 01:23:49,056
Takhisis, why have you abandoned me?

881
01:23:54,201 --> 01:23:57,796
There was a flash of light, and then
I was freed from Verminaard's spell.

882
01:23:58,071 --> 01:24:02,303
Takhisis severed her link with him.
All his power came from her.

883
01:24:06,346 --> 01:24:08,541
Hey, you all right down there?

884
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:17,748
Verminaard!

885
01:24:19,026 --> 01:24:22,462
My children will live!

886
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:37,343
No! Fizban!

887
01:24:39,847 --> 01:24:42,372
They killed the dragons!

888
01:24:45,219 --> 01:24:46,311
Run away!

889
01:24:48,121 --> 01:24:52,114
Fizban saved my life, but the shaft
collapsed before he could get out.

890
01:24:52,626 --> 01:24:54,457
I couldn't rescue him.

891
01:24:56,730 --> 01:25:01,690
Tanis, what's wrong with me?
I've never felt like this before.

892
01:25:01,802 --> 01:25:07,468
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're gonna miss him. We all are.

893
01:25:10,143 --> 01:25:13,374
DThey're the Disks of Mishakal.
DYou can read it?

894
01:25:13,514 --> 01:25:14,981
Yes. Why?

895
01:25:18,752 --> 01:25:21,152
And so, with Paladine's blessing,

896
01:25:21,255 --> 01:25:25,191
the two who stand before you
have now become one.

897
01:25:25,659 --> 01:25:29,322
Riverwind and I were kept apart
by the traditions of our people.

898
01:25:29,696 --> 01:25:32,722
But if we are all to survive
the rising tide of evil,

899
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:35,267
we must overcome the ways of the past.

900
01:25:35,369 --> 01:25:39,738
Together we will create a new tribe
in the name of the Gods of Light!

901
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:45,576
Thank the gods!

902
01:25:49,316 --> 01:25:53,878
Cheer up! We destroyed
Verminaard's army and saved the elves.

903
01:25:54,421 --> 01:25:55,786
It's a great victory.

904
01:25:55,889 --> 01:26:00,223
We may have won a battle,
but the war has just begun.

905
01:26:00,661 --> 01:26:03,425
If we are going to have
any hope of surviving it,

906
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:08,024
we need to find the dragonlances,
if they still exist.

907
01:26:08,869 --> 01:26:11,963
I thought she was so naive,

908
01:26:12,072 --> 01:26:15,337
but she handled herself well
on the field of battle.

909
01:26:15,442 --> 01:26:19,503
She's more courageous than I thought.
Maybe I made a mistake.

910
01:26:19,613 --> 01:26:21,410
Too late.

911
01:26:21,515 --> 01:26:24,484
She seems to be enjoying
the company of someone else.

912
01:26:24,651 --> 01:26:27,745
Perhaps that's for the best.

913
01:26:27,854 --> 01:26:32,484
I just hope Kitiara has managed
to survive all this, wherever she is.

914
01:26:37,998 --> 01:26:41,092
You summoned me,
Dragon Highlord Kitiara?
