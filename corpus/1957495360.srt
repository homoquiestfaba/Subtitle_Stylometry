[sighs]

12
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,369
[woman] So he takes my design,

13
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:33,675
slaps the company logo on it

14
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:35,372
and submits it anonymously.

15
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:36,982
And I'm supposed to be cool
with that

16
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:38,854
because I'm a team player.

17
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:41,291
Oh, hey, uh, the couple
that bought Harold's house

18
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:42,466
moved in today.

19
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,251
Wow!

20
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,992
Thanks for the emotional support
there, Trev.

21
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:49,081
I am supporting you,
just quietly.

22
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:51,083
By changing the subject?

23
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:52,998
By not disagreeing with you.

24
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:56,263
- Do the new neighbors have kids?
- I don't know, kiddo. Maybe.

25
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:59,831
I'm supposed to just suck it up
is what you're saying?

26
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,355
It kinda seems like you're
putting words in my mouth.

27
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,531
Mom, can I be excused?

28
00:03:03,574 --> 00:03:05,359
- Am I wrong?
- Mom?

29
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:09,058
[clears throat] Look,
everybody knows it's your work.

30
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,060
So just, I don't know,

31
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,715
b-boost the firm,
not the individual.

32
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:16,457
I guess, I-I understand
the mentality is all.

33
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,415
What is it
about being unemployed

34
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,548
that turns everybody
into a communist?

35
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:23,072
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's a joke, Trev.

36
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:26,162
- Lighten up.
- Can I be excused?

37
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:31,776
I'm the one who needs
to lighten up. Copy that.

38
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,561
Yes, honey, you can be excused.

39
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:38,696
[sighs]

40
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,003
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:43,440
I shouldn't take it out on you.

42
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,921
I should just put my head down
and do the work.

43
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:49,751
Anyway, forget it.

44
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:51,883
What about the new neighbors?

45
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:54,190
Nothing. They seemed nice.

46
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,497
I didn't know
the house was for sale.

47
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,282
The old man's
only been dead for two weeks.

48
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:01,545
It's a hot market.
Gotta move fast.

49
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:05,723
[mellow music]

50
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:19,215

-[tires screeching]
- Oh! Oh! [sighs]

52
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:26,004
[chuckles] I don't know
where my head's at this morning.

53
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:27,615
That's what you have me for.

54
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:29,312
Don't forget to pick up Clio
after practice.

55
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,532
I'm on it.

56
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:33,316
Great.

57
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,100
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

58
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,757
Hey, excuse me!

59
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:43,195
I am sure
it's something super simple.

60
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,546
I've just been pressing the same
buttons over and over again

61
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,722
for the last half hour.
[chuckles]

62
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,855
- Oh-oh!
-[laughs] Yeah.

63
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,509
-[woman] Oh, my God. Awesome.
- Yeah.

64
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:54,206
- All right. Okay.
-[woman] Cool.

65
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,645
Well, um, just... Sorry.

66
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,255
- Uh, just...
- Mm-hmm.

67
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,041
Let me know if you need help
with anything else.

68
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:05,043
Um, I noticed you around
during the day.

69
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:06,567
- Do you work from home or...
-[machine whirring]

70
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,656
- Uh... [chuckles] Yeah.
-[laughs]

71
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,963
- Yeah, mostly, um... yeah.
- Doing what?

72
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:15,358
I, uh, do some consulting
and music,

73
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:18,709
but right now
I'm kind of in between gigs.

74
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:21,059
And your wife? Wife, right?

75
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:23,975
Yes. Yeah, wife. Renee.

76
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:25,890
She works
at an architectural firm.

77
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,849
Cool. She's an architect.

78
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:30,199
Architectural designer.

79
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:31,896
Isn't that, like,
kinda the same thing?

80
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,159
[laughs] Uh, apparently no.

81
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:36,423
No, not according to her.

82
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,207
Yeah. [clears throat]

83
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,426
Hey, actually, you know what?

84
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:41,602
Uh, the two of you
should come by

85
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:43,691
sometime this week
for, like, drinks and dinner,

86
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:46,128
and then we can let you in
on the deep, dark secrets

87
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:47,216
of the neighborhood.

88
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:48,652
Cool, I'd love that.

89
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:51,438
- Yes, I'll figure something out.
- Okay. Thanks.

90
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:52,700
[Trevor] Nope!

91
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:56,530
All right, you got this,
slugger. Come on.

92
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:58,401
[Trevor whistling]

00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,058
[crowd cheering]

94
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,581
[Trevor] Make him pay, kiddo.

95
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,673
You got this.

96
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:10,718
-[Trevor] Swing!
-[Clio grunts]

[crowd cheering]

98
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:13,634
Yeah! That's my girl!

[crowd cheering]

100
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:18,508
Let's go! Let's go!

101
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,749
Safe!

102
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,578
Yeah!

103
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:47,145
[Clio grunts] What'd you say...

104
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:49,234
[screaming] Come on, Pat,
dig it!

105
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:50,845
Okay!

106
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,107
-[grunting]
- Ow.

107
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,112
Look, I don't care
what he said to you.

108
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:58,766
Okay? I really don't.

109
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:04,554
Okay, I give up.

110
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:06,643
What did he say?

111
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:08,036
[indistinct whispering]

112
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:11,039
What?

113
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:13,476
Okay. Good job.

114
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,870
We're not gonna tell mom,
but I'm glad you hit him.

115
00:07:15,913 --> 00:07:17,480
-[giggles]
- You did great.

116
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,962
No fights, okay?

117
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:24,356
You mean, like, with Clio
or you mean, like, you and me?

118
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,663
All fights.

119
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:28,752
Well, I'm down.
Well, I don't know about Clio.

120
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:31,276
- That girl's a warrior.
- Yeah.

121
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,497
- Where did she get that from?
- I don't know.

122
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:37,500
Hm. Where could she
get that from?

123
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:40,285
- Xena.
-[chuckles]

124
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:43,071
You know, I think

125
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:45,813
we should have
the neighbors over for dinner.

126
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:49,686
Uh, yeah.

127
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,168
- No?
- No. Ye-yes. Yeah.

128
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,344
Um, I actually, already
mentioned it to Kaylie, so...

129
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,216
- Kaylie?
- Yeah.

130
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,522
I think that's her name.

131
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,307
Great.

132
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:06,094
Did, uh, did you and Kaylie
set a date?

133
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:08,139
No.

134
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:09,619
Just, you know,
mentioned it in passing.

135
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,229
Like, "Hey, you and your husband
should come over

136
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:14,624
for dinner sometime."
Nothing specific.

137
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:18,062
Yeah, o-okay. Yeah, sure.
We should do that.

138
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:20,891
[chuckles] Okay.

139
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,893
What was the husband's name?

140
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:27,115
Uh, it's Ray, I think.

141
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:29,378
[Ray] Then they told me I can
paint the house any color I want

142
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:31,641
as long as it's Boston Brick
or Wedgewood Gray.

143
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:34,122
[Trevor] Oh, welcome
to our homeowner's association.

144
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,602
- Your home is beautiful.
- Mm.

145
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:36,994
Like a museum.

146
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:39,344
My great-grandfather built it.

147
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:40,824
It's been in the family
ever since.

148
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:42,913
- Yeah.
- Ooh, Ray?

149
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,263
Ah, what the hell?

150
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:47,788
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I'm not driving, right?

151
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,790
So Kaylie says
you're in the music business.

152
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:53,837
Yes, yeah, I've, uh, I've done
some session work off and on,

153
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,579
but, ah, with the way
the music business is right now,

154
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:58,189
it's, it's more off than on.

155
00:08:58,233 --> 00:08:59,234
[Renee] He's amazing.

156
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:00,583
If Stevie Ray Vaughan

157
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:03,325
and Andres Segovia
had a love child...

158
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:05,022
You should hear him play.

159
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:07,285
- I wo... I'd like that.
-[Ray] Wait, Andres who?

160
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:12,247
Hey, Clio,
what's your favorite animal?

161
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,596
[virtual assistant] <i>
Boo the Space Hamster.</i>

162
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,598
-[Clio laughs]
- Oh, my God.

163
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,687
You guys have
one of those smart thingies.

164
00:09:17,731 --> 00:09:19,820
Yeah, well, as soon as she
found out that there was one

165
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:22,300
with her name,
she insisted on it.

166
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:25,565
Although, it can get
a little messed up at times.

167
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:28,959
Hey, Clio, do you know
that you're beautiful?

168
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:30,918
[virtual assistant] <i>
Life is beautiful.</i>

169
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,528
No, seriously. I mean it.

170
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,009
You are such a beautiful
little girl.

171
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,619
You're like a princess.

172
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:39,274
Tsk. Oh, she doesn't really do
the princess thing.

173
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:42,756
We don't really believe
in gender stereotypes.

174
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,324
Uh-huh, but every girl wants
to be a princess, don't they?

175
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,630
I guess.

176
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,197

But, hey,
we, we hardly know each other.

350

That's so not, not your problem.

351
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:54,638
Thank you for the beer
and the serenade.

352
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,902
Yeah, it's my pleasure.

-[gasps] Oh, my goodness!

Hi, sweetheart. Why aren't you
inside doing your homework?

355
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:06,389
-'Cause you're here.
- Well...

356
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,130
I was just about to leave,

357
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:10,828
but not before... this.

358
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:13,527
[squeals] Do you like it?

359
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:17,096

Oh, it's just my way of saying
thank you for an amazing dinner.

365
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,371
I hope she likes it.

366
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:32,937
Well, if she doesn't wear it,
I will.

367
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:35,026
[laughs] It will look good
on you.

368

Oh, God. This again?

00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,093
Come on. Not today.

373
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,834
[Kaylie] Get your life together.
[Ray] Get what life together?

374
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:01,052
I don't have anything
to get together!

376
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:07,972
[Trevor] We had fried chicken
because I make what she likes,

377
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:10,758
and what she likes
is fried chicken.

378
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:12,151
Yes, tomorrow I will make

of fresh vegetables.

Mm-hmm.

382
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:22,813

Is, uh, scotch okay?

390
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:47,838
- Sure. Yeah.
- Okay.

391
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:55,803
So what happened?

392
00:19:57,805 --> 00:19:59,372
He's just...

393
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:02,505
He, he loses it over
the tiniest things, you know?

394
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,249
There's a reason
people self-medicate.

395
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,255
Uh, what was it
that got him so upset?

396
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:17,172
You.

397
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:20,262
What?

398
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:23,222
He, he thinks I'm sweet on you.

That's...

00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:28,792
Yeah, I told him he's crazy,
he...

401
00:20:28,836 --> 00:20:31,012
- Mm.
- He didn't really like that.

402
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:34,276
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I don't...

403
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,583
I don't think
crazy people usually

404
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:39,063
like being called crazy, so...

405
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,980
I'm sorry,
am I making you uncomfortable?

406
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:45,156
No, no, just that...

407
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,681
- Uh...
- I should go.

408

No, wait, uh...

so there was no point
in coming to bed.

thinking outside my box.

878
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:05,768
[crickets chirping]

879
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:06,987
[Trevor] Listen, I just,
I felt trapped

880
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:08,249
and I didn't see
another way out.

881
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:10,904
Are you listening to yourself?

882
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,080
Do you know how you sound
to a rational person?

883
00:49:13,124 --> 00:49:16,562
Yeah, I do.
I just, I-I panicked, so...

884
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:18,781
I mean, to-to take a knife...

885
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:20,305
It wasn't a knife,
it was bolt cutters.

886
00:49:20,348 --> 00:49:22,960
- I, I used bolt cutters.
- God!

887
00:49:28,487 --> 00:49:30,010
I couldn't lose you.

888
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:35,668
I know this is gonna sound
horrible, but...

889
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,498
I'm kind of relieved.

890
00:49:41,282 --> 00:49:43,458
At least
I don't have to wonder anymore.

891
00:49:43,502 --> 00:49:46,418
- About Kaylie?
- Not just about Kaylie.

892
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:50,813
It's been going on
a lot longer than Kaylie.

893
00:49:52,076 --> 00:49:54,339
Something changed with us

894
00:49:54,382 --> 00:49:57,646
after Clio was born.

895
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:01,302
I mean, I don't know
if it was... parenthood

896
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:03,043
or work

897
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:06,307
or continental drift.

898
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:08,962
I just think every relationship
has growing pains.

899
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,660
No. It was more than that.

900
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:15,664
I honestly thought
you were gonna leave me.

901
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:21,148
I would never leave you.

902
00:50:21,192 --> 00:50:22,802
Well, I see that now.

903
00:50:24,108 --> 00:50:26,066
[both laughing]

904
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,982
Uh, yeah, I mean...

905
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,028
Maybe I should've done this
a long time ago.

906
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:42,865
I need you to know something.

907
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:49,220
If this is about John,
I really don't wanna hear it.

908
00:50:53,572 --> 00:50:54,660
Great.

909
00:50:56,096 --> 00:50:57,837
How long has that been going on?

910
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:00,709
A couple of months.

911
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:04,713
It was just once.

912
00:51:09,153 --> 00:51:12,069
I don't, I don't know

913
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:15,202
if I was trying to hurt you...

914
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,292
or hurt myself.

915
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,341
I just needed to feel something.

916
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,213
Anything.

917
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:30,696
But afterward,
I just felt empty.

918
00:51:32,741 --> 00:51:34,221
And that was it.

919
00:51:34,265 --> 00:51:37,050
The next day I told him
it was a big mistake

920
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,791
and it would never happen again.

921
00:51:38,834 --> 00:51:41,272
So all those late-nights were...

922
00:51:41,315 --> 00:51:44,275
Because he wasn't there.

923
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:46,581
It was the only time
I could be alone.

924
00:51:49,062 --> 00:51:51,717
And still,
he had his way with me.

925
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,501
He's taken all my designs

926
00:51:53,545 --> 00:51:57,026
and doesn't give me credit
for anything.

927
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,550
I mean,
I guess that's my punishment

928
00:51:58,593 --> 00:52:02,336
for taking what was going to be
a promising affair

929
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,774
and turning it
into a lousy one-night stand.

930
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:08,995
- You could've quit.
- Could I?

931
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:13,130
Yeah, you could've gone
to another firm.

932
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:16,307
With what?

933
00:52:18,004 --> 00:52:20,963
I don't have a portfolio.

934
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:23,966
I don't have my name
on anything.

935
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:26,230
The second
I put myself out there,

936
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:30,147
he's gonna tear me down so fast
that no one would hire me.

937
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:34,499
Hey.

938
00:52:37,023 --> 00:52:38,329
I'm sorry.

939
00:52:40,592 --> 00:52:42,159
I'm sorry for everything.

940
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:44,422
Me, too.

941
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:50,167
[intense music]

942
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,128
[birds chirping]

943
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,999
[man] What do you do?
[Trevor] Musician, mostly.

944
00:52:57,043 --> 00:52:58,914
But that's not gonna be
happening anytime soon.

945
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:01,178
So I figured I'd get off
the couch, make myself useful.

946
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:03,571
So you don't have any real
construction experience?

947
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,269
Ah, I worked
with Habitat For Humanity

948
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:06,705
after college for a little bit.

949
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:08,185
Yeah? How'd that go?

950
00:53:08,228 --> 00:53:11,231
Pay sucked. [chuckles] Yeah.

951
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:13,364
Well, look, I've just got
general labor stuff.

952
00:53:13,407 --> 00:53:15,235
Uh, unloading, cleaning up.

953
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:17,585
- I can start you at 17 bucks.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

954
00:53:17,629 --> 00:53:19,544
I just, I need to be done
in time to get my daughter

955
00:53:19,587 --> 00:53:21,633
after she's off school,
if that's okay.

956
00:53:21,676 --> 00:53:22,938
Yeah.

957
00:53:25,898 --> 00:53:29,206
- Sign here and here.
- Yeah.

958
00:53:29,249 --> 00:53:30,946
So you're good
with power tools, huh?

959
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:32,731
[chuckles] Long story.

960
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:38,954
So I'm thinking
of going back to school.

961
00:53:38,998 --> 00:53:43,002
Maybe take the NCARB exam
this fall.

962
00:53:43,045 --> 00:53:44,917
That's amazing.

963
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,269
Wow, our own board-certified
architect in the house.

964
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:51,880
Well,
I still have to pass the exam.

965
00:53:51,924 --> 00:53:53,839
They say it's even harder
than the bar.

966
00:53:53,882 --> 00:53:56,058
You'll nail it. I have no doubt.

967
00:53:57,146 --> 00:53:59,105
Well, that's one of us.

968
00:54:00,846 --> 00:54:02,978
Well, for what it's worth,
and trust me,

969
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:04,502
it's not worth much,

970
00:54:04,545 --> 00:54:06,286
your husband got a job today.

971
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:09,115
[Renee] What? That's great!

972
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:10,421
Well, tell us about it.

973
00:54:10,464 --> 00:54:12,553
Uh, it's construction.
Entry-level.

974
00:54:12,597 --> 00:54:14,163
But it should count towards
my union days.

975
00:54:14,207 --> 00:54:15,817
And, and who knows?

976
00:54:15,861 --> 00:54:18,037
Maybe one day I will even build

977
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,474
one of those fancy houses
you design.

978
00:54:20,518 --> 00:54:22,476
Well, what do you think
about that?

979
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,306
Your dad and I building a home
for some lucky family like ours.

980
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,134
[eerie music]

981
00:54:29,614 --> 00:54:31,659
[Trevor panting]

982
00:54:31,703 --> 00:54:33,531
[Renee] What's wrong, honey?

983
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:35,881
I hate parsnip.

984
00:54:38,362 --> 00:54:39,624
[Trevor clears throat]

985
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:41,974
Am I ever going to see
Kaylie again?

986
00:54:42,017 --> 00:54:44,368
[Renee] I don't know.

987
00:54:44,411 --> 00:54:45,673
Not right now.

988
00:54:46,805 --> 00:54:48,154
[Clio] Why not?

989
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:51,462
She's not a good person, kiddo.

990
00:54:51,505 --> 00:54:53,638
Because she made you
cut off your finger?

991
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:01,123
Finish your stew.

992
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,955
[Trevor] What else
has she told her?

993
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:11,220
- That-that lying, manipulative...
- Trevor...

994
00:55:11,264 --> 00:55:13,222
She's not gonna stop until she
turns our daughter against us.

995
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:15,660
- You know that, right?
- That's not gonna happen.

996
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:18,924
- Mm...
- Clio's a smart girl.

997
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:21,056
We're not gonna let her
get brainwashed

998
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,146
by some bitter,
has-been trash queen.

999
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:27,802
No, no.
Do not underestimate her, Renee.

1000
00:55:27,846 --> 00:55:29,543
I already
made that mistake once.

1001
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:45,907
I didn't know you use this gym.

1002
00:55:45,951 --> 00:55:48,693
I know! It's crazy, right?

1003
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:50,695
[sighs]

1004
00:55:50,738 --> 00:55:54,481
Well, since we're here,

1005
00:55:54,525 --> 00:55:56,918
I think you and I should have
a little chat.

1006
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:02,097
Argh! My God!

1007
00:56:04,665 --> 00:56:06,537
Ow! What?

1008
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:09,409
Uh, oh, not much.
I'm just being stalked is all.

1009
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:13,370
What? Well, you're hot.

1010
00:56:13,413 --> 00:56:17,635
I'd stalk you, too,
if I wasn't your brother.

1011
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:20,028
She threatened me.
Hey, what are you doing?

1012
00:56:20,072 --> 00:56:21,813
[Ray] Ow!

1013
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:23,858
What is this?

1014
00:56:23,902 --> 00:56:25,512
- Do...
- What are you doing?

1015
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:26,557
[Kaylie] Ugh...
[Ray] Oh, that's...

1016
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,341
[Ray mumbles]

1017
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,169
You're supposed to meet
with your PO this afternoon.

1018
00:56:30,212 --> 00:56:31,562
- Remember?
- Oh, PO.

1019
00:56:31,605 --> 00:56:33,390
I don't care.
I'll go back to prison.

1020
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:35,392
I got friends there.

1021
00:56:35,435 --> 00:56:37,481
The food's good in prison.

1022
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:38,960
They're not your friends,
Ray-Ray.

1023
00:56:39,004 --> 00:56:40,701
What?

1024
00:56:40,745 --> 00:56:43,182
You have no friends, remember?

1025
00:56:43,225 --> 00:56:45,880
- I have friends.
- I'm all you got.

1026
00:56:45,924 --> 00:56:49,014
- Yeah.
- And you're all I got.

1027
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:51,930
We look out for each other.

1028
00:56:51,973 --> 00:56:54,411
Nobody else does that
and nobody ever will.

1029
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:55,847
- Mm.
- Okay?

1030
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:59,807
- Inside prison or out.
- Okay.

1031
00:56:59,851 --> 00:57:02,070
Just keep it together
for a few hours.

1032
00:57:02,114 --> 00:57:03,115
- Yeah.
- That's all I ask.

1033
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:04,508
Okay.

1034
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:06,335
Then I can tell you
all about my crappy day.

1035
00:57:06,379 --> 00:57:09,251
- Can you just don't do that?
-[toilet flushes]

1036
00:57:09,295 --> 00:57:12,211
[engine rumbling]

1037
00:57:23,178 --> 00:57:25,093
-[Renee grunts]
-[Clio chuckles]

1038
00:57:27,052 --> 00:57:29,010
You know you can tell us
anything.

1039
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:31,926
Anything at all.

1040
00:57:33,711 --> 00:57:37,149
- We love you so much.
- Love you, too, mommy.

1041
00:57:40,065 --> 00:57:41,980
Mm...

1042
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:45,200
All right.

1043
00:57:58,213 --> 00:58:02,261
[groans] These bones
weren't made for heavy lifting.

1044
00:58:02,304 --> 00:58:03,741
[groans]

1045
00:58:04,916 --> 00:58:08,746
Well, where does it hurt?

1046
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,138
Everywhere.

1047
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:15,056
Oh. That feels good.

1048
00:58:28,026 --> 00:58:30,942
[mellow music]

1049
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:52,441
I feel better.

1050
00:58:54,705 --> 00:58:56,054
So do I.

1051

[dramatic music]

1053
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,964
[wind howling]

1054
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:41,142
- Trevor, Trevor.
- Hm?

1055
00:59:48,454 --> 00:59:50,369
[knocking on door]

1056
00:59:53,372 --> 00:59:54,547
[knocking on door]

1057
01:00:00,292 --> 01:00:01,554
[Trevor] Hello?

1058
01:00:02,773 --> 01:00:04,992
Hello?

1059
01:00:05,036 --> 01:00:07,560
It's Trevor and Renee.
We're just looking for Clio.

1060
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,257
- Oh, my God!
- What?

1061
01:00:09,301 --> 01:00:12,173
They haven't even unpacked yet.

1062
01:00:12,217 --> 01:00:14,567
Ray, I'm coming upstairs.
Don't do anything crazy.

1063
01:00:27,449 --> 01:00:29,190
The beds are stripped.
They're gone.

1064
01:00:30,322 --> 01:00:33,238
[music continues]

1065
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:39,636
Trevor?

1066
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:42,943
[footsteps approaching]

1067
01:00:47,382 --> 01:00:50,603
- What?
-[panting] The box.

1068
01:01:03,268 --> 01:01:04,835
It's empty.

1069
01:01:12,016 --> 01:01:13,582
They're all empty.

1070
01:01:16,281 --> 01:01:17,804
They don't live here.

1071
01:01:18,936 --> 01:01:20,764
The boxes, the truck...

1072
01:01:23,288 --> 01:01:24,942
It was all for show.

1073
01:01:24,985 --> 01:01:26,465
- No, it's not. It's not...
- They don't live here.

1074
01:01:26,508 --> 01:01:28,380
It's not possible.
They bought the house.

1075
01:01:28,423 --> 01:01:32,036
Did they? How do we know that?

1076
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,212
The house
isn't even on the market yet.

1077
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,131
Oh, my...

1078
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:44,962
Oh, my... [sobbing]

1079
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:46,746
She was here.

1080
01:01:48,095 --> 01:01:50,794
Clio was here.

1081
01:01:50,837 --> 01:01:52,578
[sobbing]

1082
01:01:52,621 --> 01:01:55,712
They left this so we would know.

1083
01:01:57,409 --> 01:02:00,542
[sobbing] No!

1084
01:02:00,586 --> 01:02:01,761
[sobbing]

1085
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:04,677
- Hey, it's okay.
-[sobbing]

1086
01:02:08,986 --> 01:02:10,291
It's okay.

1087
01:02:10,335 --> 01:02:11,379
[indistinct radio chatter]

1088

[dog barking in distance]

[indistinct radio chatter]

1090
01:02:36,665 --> 01:02:38,189
What are they doing
in the backyard?

1091
01:02:38,232 --> 01:02:40,191
It's just procedure, ma'am.

1092
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:42,106
Are they looking for a body?

1093
01:02:42,149 --> 01:02:44,673
- Is that what they're doing?
- Renee, don't.

1094
01:02:44,717 --> 01:02:46,893
I wanna know what they're doing.

1095
01:02:46,937 --> 01:02:48,416
They're looking for anything
that might help

1096
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,723
in the investigation.

1097
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,770
Buried... in the backyard.

1098
01:02:55,946 --> 01:02:57,643
[Trevor] Look,
I-I spoke to Gary.

1099
01:02:57,686 --> 01:02:59,471
He's the president of our HOA,
and he said that the house

1100
01:02:59,514 --> 01:03:02,517
is still in probate, and it has
been ever since Harold Jenkins,

1101
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:04,868
the previous owner died
last November.

1102
01:03:04,911 --> 01:03:07,435
Gary said he just assumed
that they were relatives

1103
01:03:07,479 --> 01:03:10,569
of Harold's or something.

1104
01:03:10,612 --> 01:03:12,571
[man] Nothing on a Kaylie Drake.

1105
01:03:12,614 --> 01:03:13,790
[sighs]

1106
01:03:15,095 --> 01:03:19,143
Try, uh, Kaylie Ann Clevender.

1107
01:03:19,186 --> 01:03:22,320
It was her name back then
in the pageanting days.

1108
01:03:25,149 --> 01:03:26,977
Did you call in an Amber Alert?

1109
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:30,023
Your daughter's information was
entered into the NCIC system,

1110
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:32,852
but we still need an accurate
description of the vehicle.

1111
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:35,463
It was yellow. A compact.

1112
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:37,204
Can you tell me what kind?

1113
01:03:37,248 --> 01:03:41,121
I don't know. I...
I-I didn't look at it closely.

1114
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:44,559
This her?

1115
01:03:44,603 --> 01:03:46,605
Yeah, that's her.

1116
01:03:46,648 --> 01:03:48,563
We got ourselves a looker.

1117
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:53,481
We got an address.

1118
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:56,354
Our girl likes to keep moving.

1119
01:03:56,397 --> 01:03:59,748
Eleven known places of residence
in five states.

1120
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:02,751
Always with her brother
until he upped and moved

1121
01:04:02,795 --> 01:04:04,492
to Washington State Pen.

1122
01:04:04,536 --> 01:04:07,844
Down the hall
from the Hillside Strangler.

1123
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:10,716
Okay. So then, what do we do?
I mean, what's our next move?

1124
01:04:10,759 --> 01:04:12,979
Just sit tight for now,
we'll be in touch

1125
01:04:13,023 --> 01:04:15,416
the second we know anything.

1126
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:16,809
Okay.

1127
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:21,988
[woman] Ninety-seven percent
of all abducted kids

1128
01:04:22,032 --> 01:04:24,904
are found alive and well,
Mrs. Gustafson.

1129
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:27,428
Those are
some pretty decent numbers.

1130
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:32,477

[Renee] <i>I'm trying to speak
to Detective Dobbs.</i>

1133
01:04:39,919 --> 01:04:42,443
Uh, the other person had...

1134
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:45,838
No. No. The other person...

1135
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,666
The other person...

1136
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:50,974
They transferred me to you,
so...

1137
01:04:51,017 --> 01:04:53,237
Hi. Yes. Yes. Yes.

1138
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,152
I'm trying to speak
to Detective Dobbs.

1139
01:04:55,195 --> 01:04:56,980
No, you,
you are not putting me...

1140
01:04:57,023 --> 01:05:00,461
Okay. Yeah, hi. I'm trying
to speak to Detective Dobbs.

1141
01:05:00,505 --> 01:05:03,160
The, the other person
had me on hold.

1142
01:05:03,203 --> 01:05:06,076
No. The other...

1143
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,819

1146
01:05:53,601 --> 01:05:55,386
Hey, Clio?

1147
01:05:55,429 --> 01:05:57,170
[virtual assistant] <i>
Yes, Trevor?</i>

1148
01:05:58,389 --> 01:06:01,392
Tell me about my daughter.

1149
01:06:01,435 --> 01:06:03,350
<i>What would you like to know,
Trevor?</i>

1150
01:06:05,352 --> 01:06:07,789
I don't know. Um...

1151
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:09,617
Tell me what her smile's like.

1152
01:06:10,879 --> 01:06:12,794
<i>I'm sure it's nice.</i>

1153
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,408
Where is she?

1154
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:21,499
Clio, where is my daughter?

1155
01:06:21,542 --> 01:06:23,936
<i>Your daughter
went to live with Kaylie.</i>

1156
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,678
<i>She will miss you and Renee
very much.</i>

1157
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:29,376
How do you know that?

1158
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,638
<i>Clio made a note.</i>

1159
01:06:30,682 --> 01:06:33,598
<i>May 13th, 11:42 p.m.</i>

1160
01:06:34,555 --> 01:06:36,470
Where did they go?

1161
01:06:36,514 --> 01:06:38,516
<i>I don't have
that information, Trevor,</i>

1162
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,909
<i>but I can play the voice note
if you'd like.</i>

1163
01:06:40,953 --> 01:06:43,434
Yeah. Yeah, play it.

1164
01:06:46,741 --> 01:06:49,527
[Clio] <i>Kaylie says
I'll get to go on fun trips</i>

1165
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:52,747
<i>and wear
the prettiest clothes ever.</i>

1166
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:56,360
<i>You'll both understand because
you only want me to be happy.</i>

1167
01:06:59,624 --> 01:07:03,845
<i>Kaylie says someday soon you'll be really, really proud of me.</i>

1168
01:07:03,889 --> 01:07:06,370
<i>And then all the sad stuff
will go away</i>

1169
01:07:06,413 --> 01:07:09,112
<i>and you and mommy
will never argue again.</i>

1170
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,729
[Clio] Daddy?

1171
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:23,213
Come on, we're gonna be late.

1172
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:54,244
[Renee] <i>What do you mean,
"No police?"</i>

1173
01:07:54,287 --> 01:07:55,506
Look, they have this
all figured out,

1174
01:07:55,549 --> 01:07:58,770
and, and whatever it is...

1175
01:07:58,813 --> 01:08:00,467
[sighs] they're the ones
that are in control,

1176
01:08:00,511 --> 01:08:02,817
so we have to do what they say.

1177
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:04,819
But the police are trained
for this kind of thing.

1178
01:08:04,863 --> 01:08:06,647
Baby, the police would need
an entire army

1179
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:08,388
to storm that theater.

1180
01:08:08,432 --> 01:08:09,955
Ray needs a bullet.

1181
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:14,307
Don't talk that way.

1182
01:08:14,351 --> 01:08:16,440
Listen to me.
I know what he's capable of.

1183
01:08:16,483 --> 01:08:18,616
This is wrong.
This is all wrong.

1184
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:24,143
We have to believe that.
Otherwise none of this matters.

1185
01:08:25,492 --> 01:08:28,756
If we do what they say,
she stays safe.

1186
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,715
How do we know that?

1187
01:08:30,758 --> 01:08:34,327
Because she doesn't wanna
hurt Clio.

1188
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:35,894
She wants to hurt me.

1189
01:08:38,462 --> 01:08:41,073
Look, I don't know
what you're planning,

1190
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:43,684
but this is not the way.

1191
01:08:43,728 --> 01:08:45,773
This is not
how we get our daughter back.

1192
01:08:46,992 --> 01:08:48,863
There is no other way.

1193
01:08:48,907 --> 01:08:51,344
This is it.

1194
01:08:51,388 --> 01:08:53,303
I promise you,
I'm gonna get her back.

1195
01:08:54,956 --> 01:08:56,132
I promise.

1196
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,185
I'm coming with you.

1197
01:09:30,253 --> 01:09:31,732
Hey, take a seat.

1198
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:34,082
Oh, can you, uh, shut the door?

1199
01:09:34,126 --> 01:09:35,214
Thanks.

1200
01:09:38,739 --> 01:09:40,350
[sniffles]

1201
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:43,091
Come on, guys.
Show's about to start.

1202
01:09:43,135 --> 01:09:45,529
[Trevor] Where's she?
Where's Clio?

1203
01:09:46,530 --> 01:09:48,009
She's fine.

1204
01:09:48,053 --> 01:09:49,968
So let's keep it that way.

1205
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:52,318
Sit.

1206
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:05,810
Good boy.

1207
01:10:05,853 --> 01:10:09,379
Hey, I think you guys
are really gonna dig this.

1208
01:10:09,422 --> 01:10:11,555
It's gonna be great.

1209
01:10:11,598 --> 01:10:14,514
[instrumental music]

1210
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,573
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1211
01:10:29,616 --> 01:10:33,316
I am your host,
Morris Galinsky.

1212
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:36,232
- That's pronounced Gavinsky.
-[laughing]

1213
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:39,017
[Morris] Is this thing working?
All right.

1214
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:40,453
Morrie and Kaylie go way back.

1215
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:42,325
He's worked, like,
all of her pageants.

1216
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:44,022
I mean, he's a little gone
in the head these days,

1217
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:45,545
but he's a great guy,
he's the best.

1218
01:10:45,589 --> 01:10:47,939
[Morris] I've had bigger houses
in my life,

1219
01:10:47,982 --> 01:10:51,464
but a gig is a gig
and I will work 'em all.

1220
01:10:51,508 --> 01:10:53,988
Okay, everybody!

1221
01:10:54,032 --> 01:10:56,774
Now, you all ready
for a great evening?

1222
01:10:56,817 --> 01:10:58,863
"Our judge tonight

Let's hear it for Trevor!

Come on, everybody.
Stand up there, Trevor.

1229
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:16,315

1231
01:11:17,969 --> 01:11:20,188
[Ray] Here he is.
He's right here.

Hey, you with the musket!

1233
01:11:23,148 --> 01:11:25,585
- Is that real?
- Sure is, Morrie.

1234
01:11:25,629 --> 01:11:29,154
You talk about a tough crowd,
here they come armed already.

1235
01:11:29,197 --> 01:11:30,895
So without further ado

1236
01:11:30,938 --> 01:11:34,072
and until we next say adieu,

Well, hello to you.

Tell us a little bit
about yourself, Clio.

1245
01:11:54,614 --> 01:11:57,051
I'm seven years old,
and I love dancing,

- Uh! Don't do it.
- Trev-Trevor, Trevor, don't.

Come on. Sit down.

But especially, I love my family

1252
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:11,936
and I love my school
and friends.

1253
01:12:11,979 --> 01:12:15,113
[Morris] Maybe you have
a message for us all?

1254
01:12:15,156 --> 01:12:17,507
God gave us
so many incredible blessings,

1255
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:19,509
but also the responsibility

1256
01:12:19,552 --> 01:12:22,642
to look after those
less fortunate than ourselves.

1257
01:12:22,686 --> 01:12:25,384
If we could all love one another
and look past our differences,

1258
01:12:25,428 --> 01:12:27,343
we could end hate
in our lifetimes.

1259
01:12:27,386 --> 01:12:28,605
So true.

1260
01:12:28,648 --> 01:12:31,477
[Morris] That was wonderful,
honey!

Kaylie, I stuck around
like I promised,

1268
01:12:50,801 --> 01:12:52,933
but that was worth a hell
of a lot more than a C-note.

1269

afford you for longer than that.

I will.

unspoiled beauty.

Kinda like getting a do-over,

to our judge.

01:19:09,788 --> 01:19:13,096
You okay, honey?
You're sweating.

1394
01:19:13,139 --> 01:19:16,534
Oh, you must be starving.
I know I am. I'm ravenous.

1395
01:19:16,577 --> 01:19:17,796
Ray, let's stop
for a froggy burger

1396
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,015
and a cookie butter shake, okay?

1397
01:19:19,058 --> 01:19:21,104
Yeah, we can do that
in Bakersfield.

1398
01:19:21,147 --> 01:19:22,496
Sounds good!

1399
01:19:23,933 --> 01:19:25,761
Baby, what's wrong?

1400
01:19:25,804 --> 01:19:27,414
I don't feel well.

1401
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:29,634
I-it's okay, it's just nerves.

1402
01:19:29,677 --> 01:19:32,637
We all get 'em on pageant days.
It's completely normal.

1403
01:19:35,683 --> 01:19:38,382
Okay, Ray, maybe you should
pull over. She's gonna be sick.

1404
01:19:38,425 --> 01:19:39,775
- What?
- Baby, it's okay. Shh!

1405
01:19:39,818 --> 01:19:41,646
She's gonna be sick.
Can you pull over?

1406
01:19:41,689 --> 01:19:43,082
Yeah.

1407
01:19:43,126 --> 01:19:46,085
[Clio groaning]

1408
01:19:46,129 --> 01:19:48,218
Come on. No, no, no.
Not on me, sweetie.

1409
01:19:48,261 --> 01:19:49,567
Take it
from the queen of bulimia.

1410
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:51,264
You'll feel much better
after you...

1411
01:19:51,308 --> 01:19:53,484
Ray!

1412
01:19:53,527 --> 01:19:54,615
I got it.

1413
01:19:57,401 --> 01:19:58,619
[Renee] Trevor!

1414
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:03,624
[intense music]

1415
01:20:13,896 --> 01:20:15,332
Excuse me. Coming through.
Thank you.

1416
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:17,290
Nothing to see here. Thank you.

1417
01:20:22,295 --> 01:20:23,253
[grunts]

1418
01:20:25,646 --> 01:20:27,431
-[panting]
-[woman] Hey!

1419
01:20:27,474 --> 01:20:29,215
What's the rush, Flo-Jo?

1420
01:20:29,259 --> 01:20:32,218
Ah, thank God.
Thank you so much, ma'am.

1421
01:20:32,262 --> 01:20:34,873
Yeah. She's just, uh...
[panting]

1422
01:20:34,917 --> 01:20:36,875
She just gets a bit crazy
sometimes.

1423
01:20:36,919 --> 01:20:37,920
Don't you, sweetheart?

1424
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:39,573
- Yeah?
- He your daddy?

1425
01:20:39,617 --> 01:20:41,575
-[Clio] No.
- Oh, sure, sunshine. Yeah.

1426
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:44,578
-[footsteps approaching]
- That's her mommy back there.

1427
01:20:44,622 --> 01:20:47,451
- It's okay, sweetheart.
-[panting] Hi.

1428
01:20:47,494 --> 01:20:49,975
- Hi.
- Uh...

1429
01:20:50,019 --> 01:20:51,237
I think we might wait for a cop.

1430
01:20:51,281 --> 01:20:53,239
Oh. No. No.

1431
01:20:53,283 --> 01:20:54,893
No, that's, that's really
not necessary.

1432
01:20:54,937 --> 01:20:56,373
- Oh, no. Yeah...
- Uh, Kaylie, why don't you...

1433
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:58,723
No, that's,
that's our daughter. Clio.

1434
01:20:58,766 --> 01:21:00,594
Yeah, the doctors say
she's on the spectrum,

1435
01:21:00,638 --> 01:21:03,728
but, personally, I think she's
just headstrong like her mommy.

1436
01:21:03,771 --> 01:21:04,860
Yeah.

1437
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:09,299
-[Kaylie] Um...
- It's a happy family.

1438
01:21:09,342 --> 01:21:11,214
- Yeah.
- I just wanna be sure is all.

1439
01:21:11,257 --> 01:21:13,216
- Thank you so, so much.
- Yeah, we appreciate that.

1440
01:21:13,259 --> 01:21:15,218
I just know if it was
my daughter, I just... Ow!

1441
01:21:15,261 --> 01:21:17,176
Oh, my God!

1442
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:20,136
[intense music]

1443
01:21:23,661 --> 01:21:24,880
Trevor.

1444
01:21:35,325 --> 01:21:37,022
[grunting]

1445
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:43,289
I don't know what the law says
about killing a defenseless man,

1446
01:21:43,333 --> 01:21:45,161
but truth is, I don't care.

1447
01:21:48,599 --> 01:21:50,470
You stole my daughter.

1448
01:21:50,514 --> 01:21:52,472
Okay. Okay. That...

1449
01:21:52,516 --> 01:21:56,172
Yes, that was bad, but you can
have her back, right?

1450
01:21:56,215 --> 01:21:57,738
That was always the plan.
Sooner or later...

1451
01:21:57,782 --> 01:21:59,915
Not so fast, Miss Thing.

1452
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:00,916
[groans]

1453
01:22:02,874 --> 01:22:04,789
[grunting]

1454
01:22:06,312 --> 01:22:08,967
If you're gonna do it,
do it right.

1455
01:22:29,031 --> 01:22:31,903
[Ray] Where you going? Come on.

1456
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,905
Come on, man.

1457
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:34,906
Hey.

1458
01:22:36,038 --> 01:22:37,430
I'm sorry, daddy.

1459
01:22:37,474 --> 01:22:39,824
I'm sorry, too, kiddo.

1460
01:22:39,867 --> 01:22:41,782
[sobbing]

1461
01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:49,965
[siren wailing]

1462
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:52,924
[indistinct radio chatter]

1463
01:22:54,534 --> 01:22:57,711
[Kaylie] I don't even care
what happens to me.

1464
01:22:57,755 --> 01:23:00,192
I just wanted to help
that poor little girl.

1465
01:23:02,107 --> 01:23:04,196
If only you saw
what her life was like,

1466
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,852
it just... broke my heart.

1467
01:23:10,072 --> 01:23:12,074
And to think
what's gonna happen now...

1468
01:23:14,467 --> 01:23:16,861
what would become
of her hopes and dreams...

1469
01:23:20,778 --> 01:23:23,563
it just hurts so much.

1470
01:23:24,956 --> 01:23:26,479
[sobbing]

1471
01:23:28,786 --> 01:23:30,614
See what I did there?

1472
01:23:30,657 --> 01:23:33,921
I brought you into my world.
I made it real.

1473
01:23:33,965 --> 01:23:37,534
That, gentlemen, is acting.

1474
01:23:37,577 --> 01:23:39,666
When I get out,
I'm gonna be an actress.

1475
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:41,146
You may not know this,
but I've done the whole

1476
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:42,713
beauty-pageant thing
since I was five.

1477
01:23:42,756 --> 01:23:44,193
Do you know
how many former beauty queens

1478
01:23:44,236 --> 01:23:45,759
become A-list stars?

1479
01:23:45,803 --> 01:23:48,936
A lot. Vanessa, Michelle,
Halle, Oprah, Sharon...

1480
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:51,069
It's like a natural transition.

1481
01:23:52,375 --> 01:23:54,377
And the beauty,

1482
01:23:54,420 --> 01:23:57,684
the real beauty of it is...

1483
01:23:57,728 --> 01:23:59,643
when it comes to acting...

1484
01:24:01,688 --> 01:24:03,603
the crazier, the better.

1485
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:06,563

1486
