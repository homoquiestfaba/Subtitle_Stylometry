Andmybabyleavehome
'cause thingsain'tright

43
00:04:58,573 --> 00:05:00,973
Forthose ofyou
who thinkyoucamehere today...

44
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,772
to hear us tell you
like these Negro leaders do...

45
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,473
thatyour times
will just get better...

46
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:11,541
that weshall
overcomesomeday...

47
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:14,679
I say toyou,
you came to the wrong place.

48
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:18,054
Becauseyour times will never
get better unless you make them better.

49
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:22,160
Those ofyou who thinkyou came here
to hear us tell you...

50
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,859
to turn the other cheek
to the brutality ofthe white man...

51
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:29,801
and this system ofinjustice
that's in place right here in America...

52
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,237
you thinkyou're gonna come here
and hear us tell you...

53
00:05:32,306 --> 00:05:36,333
to go out there and beg
for a place at their lunch counter...

54
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:40,308
again, I sayyou came
to the wrong place.

55
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:44,818
We don't teach you
to turn the other cheek in the South.

56
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,650
And we don't teach you
to turn the other cheek in the North.

57
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,522
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches you to obey the law...

58
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:54,390
to carryyourselves
in a respectable way...

59
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:56,987
in a proud
Afro-American way.

60
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,257
But at the same time,
we teach you...

61
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:02,666
that anyone puts
their hand on you...

62
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:09,936
brother, you doyour best to see they
don't put their hand on anybody else...

63
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:11,273
again.

64
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:17,081
Time.

65
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,404
Just like that, Daddy.

66
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:40,531
Neverjump in one place.
Bad for the heart.

67
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,166
Forwards, backwards, sideways.

68
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:44,143
That's the most important thing.

69
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,416
I'm called Bundini.

70
00:06:57,491 --> 00:07:01,018
Rhymes with Houdini.
He was aJew too.

71
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:04,826
Some people call me Fast Black.
Some call me Daddy Mac.

72
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,663
Gave Sugar Ray Robinson
my power for seven years.

73
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:11,204
Myvoodoo. My magic.

74
00:07:11,272 --> 00:07:14,207
Now Shorty done sent me here
to work foryou.

75
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:17,506
- Who's Shorty?
- I call him Shorty.

76
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:19,773
Call him Shorty
'cause he like 'em circumcised.

77
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:24,648
Original people. Like Moses.
And I was a babe in a basket too.

78

Oh!
Rumble, young man, rumble.

128

Y'all wanna losey'all money?
Then you bet it on Sonny.

129
00:10:03,944 --> 00:10:06,811
He know I'm great.
He will fall in eight.

130

Come on, you big, ugly bear.
I'll whupyou right now.

Two-ten and a half.
Two-ten and a half!.

132
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:18,588
The challenger, Cassius Clay,
two hundred and ten and a halfpounds.

133
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,287
- Man, you sure that's right?
- That's what the weight is.

134
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:23,956
Old, ugly bear, come on.
Let's go.

135
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:28,491
You got these folks fooled. I ain't
scared ofya! I ain't scared ofya!

136
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,569
Two hundred and eighteen.
Two hundred and eighteen.

137
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,541
Sonny Liston,
the champion ofthe world.

138
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:37,907
Two hundred and eighteen pounds.

139
00:10:37,978 --> 00:10:40,037
- Pounds ofwhat?
- Pounds ofugly.

140
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:42,639
That man's so ugly,
when he sweat...

141
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:46,516
the sweat run backwards offhis forehand
just to stay away from his face.

142
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,721
Come on, you big, ugly bear!
I'll turn you into a rug!

143
00:10:53,794 --> 00:10:56,262
Keep talkin'.
I'm gonna fuckyou up.

144
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:04,236
Ifyou whup me...

145
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:08,241
I'll crawl out ofthe ring and take
the firstjet airplane out the country.

146
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:11,437
- Is that a promise, Mr. Clay?
- You'll eat his words first.

147
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:15,346
- Cassius, you're a 7-1 underdog.
- Liston says he talks with his fists.

148
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,407
- What doyou say?
- You scared ofhim?

149
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:19,748
I'm gonna give Sonny Liston
talkin' lessons...

150
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,288
boxin' lessons
and fallin' down lessons.

151
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,218
Cassius, areyou a black Muslim?
Pat Putnam says in the MiamiHerald--

152
00:11:26,293 --> 00:11:28,818
A man's religion is his own business.
What kind ofquestion is that?

153
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:34,129
- Angelo, tell me--
- Malcolm Xwas in town, then he left.

154
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:36,362
Was that so
he wouldn't embarrass you?

155
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:38,302
- Yeah, Howard?
- Liston doesn't likeyou.

156
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:41,205
Really can't stand you.
Says he wants to kill you.

157
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:43,368
Howard Cosell, you ain't
nothin' but an instigator.

158
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:47,039
- Man, howyou get that way?
- Cassius, nowyou're being truculent.

159
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:48,547
Ifit's good, I'm that.

160
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:54,714
You next. Soon as I'm done with Sonny
Liston, I'm fightin' Howard Cosell.

161
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:56,722
Y'all write that down right now.

162
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:13,567
That's good?

163
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:16,234
Wanna check that out?

164
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:26,917
Hey, man, when you get back?

I'll be sittin'

167
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:42,928
You should've stayed in the first place.
Nobody gotta hide when they're with me.

168
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:45,335
There's nothing wrong
with being cool, my brother.

169
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:46,338
He's right.

170
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:36,449

00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:43,294
and its dealers
in 37 states and Canada...

173
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,765
known to millions ofmotorists
for Big Gallon gasoline...

174
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:50,600
and by new Wildroot,
totally new Wildroot in a new tube...

175
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:55,768
with a great formula that grooms hair
to look neat and natural, never greasy.

176
00:13:55,843 --> 00:13:58,209
Another boxing milestone
is at hand.

177
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:02,180
Injust a few minutes,
Louisville's Cassius Marcellus Clay...

178
00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:04,376
will be facing
the devastating punching power...

179
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:07,682
ofthe heavyweight champion,
Charles "Sonny" Liston.

180
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:11,919
...for the heavyweight championship
ofthe world.

181
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,386
Introducing, on my right--

182
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:19,356
And now the time has come.

183
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:23,995
Both challenger and champion
are in the ring.

184
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,529
The heavyweight championship
ofthe world is on the line.

185
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:31,408
Ifit goes past the first round,
there will be surprises already.

186
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:35,570
Sonny Liston wrapped in that
terry cloth towel ofhis...

187
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:38,311
wrapped around his head
swami fashion...

188
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:41,218
Iooking as malevolent
and baleful as ever.

189
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:44,655
But this man
is a professional prizefighter.

190
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:46,784
Make no mistake about it.

191
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:51,897
I want a clean fight.

192
00:14:51,965 --> 00:14:54,365
When I say break,
stop punching and step back.

193
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,562
Doyou have
any questions, champ?

194
00:14:56,637 --> 00:14:58,468
Any questions, challenger?

195
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:02,305
We're fine.
Touch gloves, gentlemen. Good luck.

196
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:08,076
Good evening,
sports fans across the nation.

197
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:10,776
Liston in the white trunks
with the black stripes.

198
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:14,981
Clay, an inch and a halftaller, in
the white trunks with the red stripes--

199
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,867
And Cassius Clay
is sidestepping.

200
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,852
There it is, champ.
Stay on your toes now.

201
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,461
And we can see that the champion
is the aggressor.

202
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:03,094
There's a shot under the heart.

203
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:35,535
Cassius Clay slips away.
And now Clay pounds a left.

204
00:16:35,602 --> 00:16:38,594
Another left. A straightjab.

205
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:44,907
It seems to have stunned him.
And that's the bell.

206
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:48,414
And they're fighting after the bell.
And they're still fighting.

207
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:51,076
This round is over.

208
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:52,948
Break it up, ref.

209
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:56,114
There is no love lost between
the two contenders at this time.

210
00:16:56,189 --> 00:17:00,023
Cassius goes back to his corner.
It's been an amazing round.

211
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:01,583
You can beat this guy.

212
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:06,588
I'm still here.

213
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:10,034
And Sonny Liston
is not taking the stool.

214
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:13,129
He's anxious to get back
into the challenger's face.

215
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:16,141
Take it to the body.
Kill the body, the head will follow.

216
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:49,505
This is a totally different fight
than Liston expected...

217
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:51,441
and anyone in this arena
will tell you.

218
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:55,880
There's a long, looping left hand.
Clay's eyes are wide open now.

219
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:08,925
- Come on, Cass! Move!
- Step back.

220
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:13,832
- Come on, Cassius!
- Come on, Chi-Chi!

221
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,531
I'm not prognosticating
anything...

222
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:20,971
but merely his survival
to thisjuncture--

223
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:40,626
Cass, hit him!

224
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:52,737
Break.

225
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:56,072
Let him go.

226
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,201
Sonny Liston is hurt.
He's bleeding from his eye.

227
00:19:31,144 --> 00:19:32,475
He's defying the experts early.

228
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:37,415
We have to take a look at this man and
say he is not in awe ofthe champion.

229
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:09,270
He ain't nothin' to me.
And he know it.

230
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:10,782
This is it now.

231
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:18,691
Let me have that,John.

232
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,357
And now they're ready.

233
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,128
You gonna knock
the ugly offofhim.

234
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:34,469
That's gonna take a long time,
butyou can do it.

235
00:20:38,578 --> 00:20:40,876
There he is. Get him off.
Doyourjob, ref.

236
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:44,014
Shake him.
Doyourjob, ref.

237
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:51,050
There it is.

238
00:20:51,858 --> 00:20:53,450
Come on, ref.

239
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,319
Break.

240
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,871
- There he is.
- Clay slips around and out.

241
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,572
Up against the ropes.
Right above me now.

242
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:19,276
Too tight. Get in there.

243
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:33,729
My eyes. There's something in my eyes.
I can't see nothin'.

244
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,892
Come on.

245
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,733
- What's going on?
- Nothin'.

246
00:21:39,806 --> 00:21:43,367
The guy's punchin' on the breaks.
Just take care ofit. We're fine.

247
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:47,778
I can't see nothin', man.
Just go and cut 'em off, Angie.

248
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,681
No, no. You can't fight
with no gloves on.

249
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,452
Just get up. Get up.
Try and do it. Come on.

250
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,954
I can't see, man.

251
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:58,684
- Come on, Cass!
- Dance!

252
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,356
Liston crouching,
hitting to the body.

253
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:10,403
It's like he's blinking,
like he doesn't see Liston.

254
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,064
Ref, you gotta doyourjob.

255
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:23,806
Hold it.

256
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,220
Stay away from him, Clay.
Stay away from him.

257
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,390
The champion, you can see,
is the aggressor.

258
00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:40,766
- Get him, Cass!
- Come on, Cass!

259
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:44,360
- Knock him up!
- Clay looks all done.

260
00:22:44,437 --> 00:22:46,428
Hold on to him!

261
00:22:50,644 --> 00:22:53,442
- Stop it. Stop. Break.
- Knock him up.

262
00:22:56,816 --> 00:22:59,250
Get on him.
Get on him, man.

263
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:19,372
- You can see him now.
- You go get him, man.

264
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:33,008
Clay lands a left,
but Liston ducked under it...

265
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:35,350
and took it high
on the forehead.

266
00:23:36,323 --> 00:23:38,518
It's Clay coming on.

267
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,159
And Liston backs away.

268
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:35,542
And all the predictions
are going down the drain...

269
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:37,549
as Liston is listless.

270
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,716
And there's the bell.

271
00:24:44,624 --> 00:24:46,558
We're coming up
to round seven.

272
00:25:24,864 --> 00:25:27,230
Wait a minute!

273
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,097
Liston's not coming out.

274
00:25:30,103 --> 00:25:33,402
The winner and new heavyweight
champion ofthe world is Cassius Clay.

275
00:25:33,473 --> 00:25:37,500
Eatyourwords!
Eatyourwords!

276
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:41,343
Les, I'm going up into the ring.
Get back.

277
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,948
I'm the greatest thing
ever happened to boxing.

278
00:25:45,018 --> 00:25:46,849
Cassius. Cassius.

279
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,480
I shook up the world!

280
00:25:49,556 --> 00:25:52,821
It's a scene of
absolute bedlam in the ring!

281
00:25:52,892 --> 00:25:57,158
I am the greatest.
I'm a bad man. I shook up the world!

282
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,959
Did he ever hurtyou?

283
00:25:59,032 --> 00:26:02,024
I'm only 22 years old.
I ain't got a mark on my face.

284
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,036
- I must be the greatest.
- And you're pretty.

285
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,038
I must be the greatest.

286
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,371
Wait. Hold on. Hold on one second.
That's Sam Cooke back there.

287
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,376
- Come on, Sam Cooke.
- Let Sam Cooke in here.

288
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:14,345
The greatest rock-and-roll singer,
and I'm the world's greatest boxer.

289
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:15,938
Hello, Sam.

290
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:27,019
That mummy's
gonna get him, baby.

291
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:30,295
- That mummy ain't gonna get him.
- Yeah, he is.

292
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:34,629
He ain't scared ofthat mummy.
That mummy too slow to catch anybody.

293
00:26:35,568 --> 00:26:38,196
- What's going on, Sam?
- Howyou doing, Cassius?

294
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:42,731
Don't believe that stuffon TV.
Don't listen to him.

295
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,936
- Hey, congratulations, Clay.
- Hey, thankyou,Jim.

296
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:48,003
- Hell ofa fight.
- You next, man. You next.

297
00:26:48,081 --> 00:26:51,380
- Go ahead and get some food, brother.
- Cassius ClayversusJim Brown.

298
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:52,884
Biggest fight in history.

299
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:56,080
- The mummy only has one eye.
- One eye and a limp.

300
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,750
That mummy's 643 years old.

301
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,759
He can't catch nobody.
Look at him.

302
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:04,024
You gotta fall down 'cause that's
the onlyway the mummy could catch you.

303
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:17,009
Way to go, champ!

304
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:23,082
- Yeah, you the greatest.
- Thankyou, brother. Thankyou.

305
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:25,140
- I'll seeyour next fight.
- You'll see the next one?

306
00:27:25,218 --> 00:27:28,051
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, you better get there very early.

307
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:31,113
You better get there very early
'cause that man's going down.

308
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,488
Ifhe talk a littlejive,
he's going down in five.

309
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,333
He talk a little more,
I might drop him in four.

310
00:27:42,468 --> 00:27:44,663
Ifyou wanna have more fun,
do it in round one.

311
00:27:44,737 --> 00:27:46,796
Oh, yeah. Hold on.
I'm doing the rhymin'.

312
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,085
The people really look up toyou. You
plan on being a champ likeJoe Louis?

313
00:28:04,157 --> 00:28:07,126
Well, yeah, I'm gonna be
the people's champ.

314
00:28:07,193 --> 00:28:09,593
Not likeJoe Louis.
Well, you know, not exactly.

315
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,158
My name is not Clay.

316
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,794
Clay is the name ofthe people
that owned my ancestors...

317
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:19,895
and I no longerwanna be called
by that slave name.

318
00:28:19,973 --> 00:28:22,237
- I am Cassius X.
- Minister Malcolm.

319
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:24,572
What about the divisions
in the Nation oflslam?

320
00:28:24,644 --> 00:28:28,637
This is the champ's time. I'm here
as a friend to support his victory...

321
00:28:28,715 --> 00:28:31,183
so I have nothing you want.

322
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,219
I'm definitely gonna be
the people's champion...

323
00:28:33,286 --> 00:28:35,754
but I just ain't gonna be the champ
the wayyou want me to be the champ.

324
00:28:35,822 --> 00:28:38,256
I'm gonna be the champ
the way I wanna be.

325
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:52,030
...fornohomeis immune
to termites...

326
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,233
nomatterhow well
itisbuiltormaintained.

327
00:28:55,308 --> 00:28:57,276
- Hey, brother.
- I was leaving.

328
00:28:57,343 --> 00:29:00,608
I sawyour light on.
Whatyou doing up at this hour, champ?

329
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,446
Oh, man, I'm watching this program
on termites.

330
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:08,783
And them little itsy-bitsy things is
eatin' these people's whole house down.

331
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:11,551
Oh, man, look.

332
00:29:14,694 --> 00:29:19,427
I've been invited to speak
at lbadan University in Nigeria.

333
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:22,195
- You wanna go with me?
- Hey, look, man.

334
00:29:22,268 --> 00:29:26,398
You can have six million termites
in your house and don't even know it...

335
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:29,407
till you going to get something to eat
and you bust through the floor.

336
00:29:31,277 --> 00:29:35,043
- What'd you say? Where?
- Africa. You been?

337
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:37,047
Africa.

338
00:29:37,116 --> 00:29:39,482
All right, come on.
Let's go.

339
00:29:45,058 --> 00:29:46,650
What is it?

340
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,724
You ever thought
you'd lose it?

341
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,564
I mean, really lose it?

342
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:04,172
When I was little, I tore out
this picture of Emmett Till.

343
00:30:04,243 --> 00:30:06,177
They put the barbed wire
around his neck...

344
00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:10,409
and strapped him
to that 75-pound cotton gin fan.

345
00:30:10,483 --> 00:30:14,351
And they cut out one ofhis eyes
'cause he looked at some white lady.

346
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:18,123
Man.

347
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,251
I couldn't take my eyes to it,
couldn't throw it away.

348
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,766
When I heard about those...

349
00:30:28,835 --> 00:30:31,804
four little girls who got bombed
in that Birmingham church...

350
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:37,737
the prohibitions ofthe Honorable
Elijah Muhammad prevented me...

351
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,074
from speaking
my thoughts in action.

352
00:30:42,081 --> 00:30:44,276
Because Birmingham was part
ofthe civil rights struggle.

353
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,582
You know, begging for our place
at the white man's table.

354
00:30:48,654 --> 00:30:51,350
But dead children
are dead children.

355
00:30:51,424 --> 00:30:55,952
So the anger I felt
I had to contain.

356
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,957
I locked it up so tight...

357
00:31:01,033 --> 00:31:02,967
my muscles seized.

358
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:07,072
I lost control
over the right side ofmy body.

359
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,574
My leg gave out.

360
00:31:09,642 --> 00:31:12,372
Right arm gave out.
"I'm having a stroke," I thought.

361
00:31:13,946 --> 00:31:17,074
But I had to hold it in
'cause all I wanted--

362
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:21,610
Brother, all I wanted to do
was find something and break it.

363
00:31:21,687 --> 00:31:24,884
Break a part--
Break any part ofthis system...

364
00:31:24,957 --> 00:31:29,155
becauseyou are so provoked
in your heart...

365
00:31:29,228 --> 00:31:31,355
and your spirit
as a human being...

366
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,233
at dead children.

367
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,995
And I could do...

368
00:31:41,607 --> 00:31:43,336
nothing.

369
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:55,515
Everyone knows
I can't do nothing...

370
00:31:55,588 --> 00:31:57,021
anymore.

371
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:05,054
So Elijah Muhammad has suspended me
as a minister in the Nation oflslam.

372
00:32:13,573 --> 00:32:16,406
Man...

373
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,000
you can fix that.

374
00:32:18,077 --> 00:32:20,944
I don't know.

375
00:32:21,013 --> 00:32:23,311
I'll trywhen we get back.

376
00:32:31,524 --> 00:32:33,549
You get some rest, champ.

377
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:35,560
All right, brother.

378
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,797
Sit.

379
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,806
You know, only after
long service and high merit...

380
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:33,318
in the spiritual and physical rebirth
ofAfro-American people...

381
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,616
is one granted an original name.

382
00:33:35,688 --> 00:33:38,452
Butyou are special.

383
00:33:38,524 --> 00:33:39,991
A world champion.

384
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,156
So there is a gift
I wish to giveyou.

385
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,199
From this day forward...

386
00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:51,760
you will be known
as Muhammad Ali.

387
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:58,308
- What?
- That's right.

388
00:33:58,377 --> 00:34:00,311
You what?

389
00:34:02,815 --> 00:34:06,512
Well, what's wrong with our name?
My name?

390
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,918
We-- We madeyou.

391
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:10,455
Ain't nobody made me.

392
00:34:10,523 --> 00:34:12,650
No bow tie-wearin',
Arab-talkin' nigger gonna change that.

393
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:14,659
Ain't nobody in that ring but me.
I made me.

394
00:34:14,727 --> 00:34:17,252
You don't know whoyou are.

395
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,094
I know who I ain't.
I ain't drinkin'.

396
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:22,464
I ain't going back on mywife
and for sure I ain't prayin'...

397
00:34:22,535 --> 00:34:24,696
to no blond-haired,
blue-eyedJesus.

398
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,729
Paintin' those blue-eyed, blond-haired
Jesuses is what put food in you.

399
00:34:28,808 --> 00:34:31,470
- Steak and vegetables on the table.
- It's dinner!

400
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,017
Go ahead.

401
00:34:40,152 --> 00:34:41,483
Go ahead.

402
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:04,671
Hello?

403
00:35:05,578 --> 00:35:08,138
Hereyou go, Daddy.

404
00:35:08,214 --> 00:35:09,738
Thankyou, baby.

405
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:12,249
- Yeah?
- BrotherMalcolm.

406
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:16,345
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has given
the Muslim name of Muhammad Ali...

407
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:19,186
to Cassius X.

408
00:35:19,258 --> 00:35:22,694
HerbertMuhammadhasbeenput
in charge ofhis training.

409
00:35:22,762 --> 00:35:25,026
He will not be traveling
with you to Africa.

Brother Cassius

413
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,454
Not with me.

414
00:35:53,426 --> 00:35:55,553
Don't put it off.

415
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,734
We'll be fine.

416
00:36:07,873 --> 00:36:09,238
I will.

417
00:36:09,308 --> 00:36:12,471

- What's going on? Anything?
- Nothing.

426
00:36:32,298 --> 00:36:34,425
He's on the phone,
talking to his wife.

427
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,697
She's having a hard time sleeping,
the baby's kicking a lot...

428
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,034
what are they gonna
name the baby.

429
00:36:42,908 --> 00:36:46,935
Ijust wake upa couple oftimes

430
00:36:59,525 --> 00:37:01,891
Would you like to take a seat?

431
00:37:01,961 --> 00:37:03,895
Sure, thankyou.

432
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:09,796
Whaty'all done did
with the real pilot?

433
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:12,736
I am the pilot.
He's the copilot.

434
00:37:12,805 --> 00:37:14,739
Here. Sit down, Mr. Clay.

435
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:17,207
Oh, man.

436
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:21,235
In Louisville, where I growed up,
they barely let black folks drive buses.

437
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:02,275
Muhammad!

438
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:09,517
Hey, brother.
What's going on, man?

439
00:39:13,692 --> 00:39:15,660
- Whatyou doing here?
- I wasjust going to the airport.

440
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,322
Wejust got here now.
So whereyou going?

441
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,329
Liberia.

442
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,834
Say hello to Maya Angelou right here
and Ambassador Huang Hua.

443
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,735
And that is Taher Kaid.
He's the ambassador from Algeria.

444
00:39:25,804 --> 00:39:28,967
Oh, man. Where should I go?
I wanna go all over this place.

445
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:31,202
Go to Algeria.
See Ben Bella.

446
00:39:31,277 --> 00:39:35,577
Then go to see Mecca and Medina.
I just came from there.

447
00:39:35,648 --> 00:39:37,980
Made my seven circuits
around the Kaaba.

448
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:41,178
I prayed at sunrise. Two million people.
Pilgrims from all over, man.

449
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,416
Dressed the same.
High and low, the same.

450
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,324
Blond-haired, blue-eyed Muslims,
Arabs, Africans, lndonesians.

451
00:40:03,142 --> 00:40:06,043
Seeing brothersjust like us,
praying together, it was beautiful.

452
00:40:06,111 --> 00:40:08,136
I drankwater
from the well ofZem Zem.

453
00:40:08,213 --> 00:40:13,276
I prayed in the ancient city of Mena.
I prayed on Mount Arafat.

454
00:40:13,352 --> 00:40:15,786
Youshouldn'thave quarreled
with Eliijah Muhammad.

455
00:40:17,122 --> 00:40:19,317
Walking in their footsteps.

456
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:21,018
All ofus together.

457
00:40:21,093 --> 00:40:23,926
You shouldn't have quarreled
with the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

458
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,424
What?

459
00:40:27,566 --> 00:40:31,002
You shouldn't have quarreled
with Elijah Muhammad.

460
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,561
Hey, Brother Muhammad,
look here.

461
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,844
Brother Muhammad!

462
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:04,058
Listen, I'm sorry
to keepyou waiting.

463
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:19,810
Into each life...

464
00:41:19,885 --> 00:41:21,910
a little rain must fall.

465
00:41:21,987 --> 00:41:24,888
And, you know,
every day cannot be sunny.

466
00:41:24,957 --> 00:41:27,619
Every smile is not
a smile ofhappiness.

467
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,160
And every tear that is shed--

468
00:41:29,228 --> 00:41:31,458
Sonji, Sonji, Sonji.

469
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,261
- Whatyou keep saying my name for?
- 'Cause I love it, girl.

470
00:41:35,334 --> 00:41:37,734
-How long you been working with Herbert?
-About a year.

471
00:41:37,803 --> 00:41:40,704
I sell MuhammadSpeaks
over the phone.

472
00:41:40,773 --> 00:41:44,573
- What kind ofname is that?
- My father named me after Sonja Henie.

473
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:47,645
What's your father do?

474
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:51,843
He was shot in a poker game
when I was two, so he don't do nothing.

475
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:54,317
And my mother died
when I was eleven.

476
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:57,253
- Who raised you?
- My godparents.

477
00:41:57,322 --> 00:42:01,349
But I been offon my own
for a long time.

478
00:42:02,461 --> 00:42:04,429
Whatyou doing tomorrow?
Go for a ride with me.

479
00:42:04,496 --> 00:42:06,964
- Oh, no, no. I gotta work.
- I'm gonna square it with Herbert.

480
00:42:07,032 --> 00:42:09,933
- Herbert said you met the Beatles.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

481
00:42:10,002 --> 00:42:12,994
Only one of'em is smart, though.
The fella with the glasses.

482
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:15,233
Oh, he is my favorite.

483
00:42:15,307 --> 00:42:17,935
Yeah, folks was screaming
and fainting.

484
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,444
I said, "Man, is this how they act
when you get big?"

485
00:42:20,512 --> 00:42:23,140
- What did he say?
- He said, "Champ...

486
00:42:23,215 --> 00:42:27,117
the more real you get,
the more unreal it's gonna get."

487
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,045
Wow.

488
00:42:35,494 --> 00:42:37,428

Let's go.

00:43:32,384 --> 00:43:33,874
Yeah.

505
00:43:33,952 --> 00:43:36,011

I'm gonna takeyou there.

507
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:42,658
And you know I got a man somewhere
out there that I don't mind crawling to.

508
00:43:42,728 --> 00:43:46,061
Sometimes I wake up in the midnight
hour, tears rolling down my face.

509
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:48,065
And ifl look around for my man
and I can't find him...

510
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:50,601
I follow the Lord,
look a little higher.

511
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,398
Kind ofpray to the Lord.

512
00:43:52,471 --> 00:43:55,668
Because I always believed that the Lord
could help me ifnobody else could.

513
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:57,641
But sometime
I think he don't even hear me.

514
00:43:57,709 --> 00:44:00,143
So I have to fall a little lower
on my knees, look a little higher.

515
00:44:00,212 --> 00:44:02,339
Kind ofraise myvoice
a little higher.

516
00:44:02,414 --> 00:44:04,541
And this is what I say
when I call on my man.

517
00:44:04,616 --> 00:44:08,074
I especiallywantyou ladies to listen
to me 'cause maybeyou can try this.

518
00:44:08,153 --> 00:44:10,178
It might helpyou
every once in a while.

519
00:44:10,255 --> 00:44:12,723
This is whatyou say
when you call on your man.

520
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:14,725

537
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,293
Honey, please.

538

Well, you werejust so gone,

00:45:46,485 --> 00:45:49,613
Well, no,
I ain't no virgin.

542
00:45:49,688 --> 00:45:51,155
But I may as well be.

543
00:45:52,024 --> 00:45:54,424
I ain'tjoking.

544
00:45:54,493 --> 00:45:57,257
I always know when I know.

545
00:45:59,331 --> 00:46:01,595
You see this face?

546
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:03,760
You got a pretty face
for a lady's face...

547
00:46:03,835 --> 00:46:06,235
butyou ever seen anything
as pretty as me?

548
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,001
Who wouldn't want
to be with me?

549
00:46:09,074 --> 00:46:11,201
What, you five foot three
or something like that?

550
00:46:11,276 --> 00:46:13,836
That's too small for me,
but I'm gonna make an exception.

551
00:46:13,912 --> 00:46:16,244
- Oh, well, thankyou.
- Because ofyour spirit.

552
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,909
- My spirit?
- Yeah, girl. You too much fun.

553
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,578
- Butyou got to be a Muslim.
- A Muslim?

554
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:25,214
And howyou do that? Youjump over
a broom and, shazam, you're a Muslim?

555
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:28,157
I ain't never been
with nobody likeyou.

556
00:46:28,226 --> 00:46:30,217
And, baby...

557
00:46:30,295 --> 00:46:33,628
baby, you ain't never
gonna be with any other.

558
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:52,316
- What?
- That's right.

559
00:46:54,586 --> 00:46:56,713
I wanna marry her.

560
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:00,323
True love.

561
00:47:00,392 --> 00:47:03,725
You don't marry that girl.
She was a date.

562
00:47:03,795 --> 00:47:05,456
Have some fun.

563
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:09,261
She's notyourwife.
You don't marry this girl.

564
00:47:09,334 --> 00:47:12,792
Here's some management papers.
I need you to sign right there.

565
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,566
My fatherwould kill me.

566
00:47:15,907 --> 00:47:17,568
Watch whatyou're signing, Ali.

567
00:47:17,642 --> 00:47:19,576
This ain't got nothing
to do with you.

568
00:47:19,644 --> 00:47:23,808
Anything's to do with me I say is to do
with me, fat boy. I'm still a Christian.

569
00:47:24,483 --> 00:47:27,975
And get me a kosher cook. I want
that lady over at Malcolm's temple.

570
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,112
- Lana Shabazz.
- And put my brother on payroll.

571
00:47:30,188 --> 00:47:32,748
Fifty G a year
just for drivin' andjivin'.

572
00:47:32,824 --> 00:47:35,759
What doyou say, Howard?
Come on full-time as my photographer?

573
00:47:35,827 --> 00:47:39,627
I'm not gonna be on the payroll.
I'm freelance. Emphasis on "free."

574
00:47:39,698 --> 00:47:42,394
Muhammad, she's not foryou.

575
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:44,492
When I met her,
she worked in a cocktail lounge...

576
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:46,662
with a bunny tail
on her backside.

577
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:49,639
What the hell was you doing
in a bunny tail lounge anyway, Herbert?

578
00:47:49,708 --> 00:47:51,539
Sellin' MuhammadPeeks?

579
00:47:54,379 --> 00:47:58,145
- You been saving it up training, Ali.
- Your ass.

580
00:47:58,216 --> 00:48:00,946
You should spread that stuffaround
a little bit beforeyou settle down.

581
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:04,011
No, man. Marriage is
the cornerstone of Muslim life.

582
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:08,185
- Yeah, well, Sonji Roi is not a Muslim.
- Well, she's gonna be now.

583
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,660
Youjust fix it up, Herbert.

584
00:48:28,013 --> 00:48:30,743
Yeah. Okay.

585
00:48:30,816 --> 00:48:33,683
So, whywe meeting?

586
00:48:33,752 --> 00:48:36,880
I got Malcolm shoulder to shoulder
with Martin Luther King.

587
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,856
And we got Malcolm traveling all over
the world, getting Ben Bella and Nasser.

588
00:48:43,395 --> 00:48:46,330
We were better offbefore
with Malcolm inside the Nation.

589
00:48:48,266 --> 00:48:52,066
So we've decided
we wantyou...

590
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,573
to get Elijah Muhammad
to take Malcolm back.

591
00:49:04,015 --> 00:49:06,040
That's ajoke,Joe.

592
00:49:18,263 --> 00:49:21,460
When am I being reimbursed
for my expenses?

593
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:23,865
Dry-cleaning all these suits
is not free.

594
00:49:25,737 --> 00:49:28,103
We gotta talk about this guy too.

595
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:35,279
Get me receipts, I'll reimburseyou
foryour dry cleaning.

596
00:49:44,956 --> 00:49:46,890
- Whatyou drinking?
- What I'm drinking?

597
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:49,893
Come on, champ. This is water.
You know I'm a natural man.

598
00:49:49,961 --> 00:49:51,394
You know.

599
00:49:51,463 --> 00:49:54,398
- What's going on? We're late.
- I'm changing my damn clothes.

600
00:49:54,466 --> 00:49:57,924
You gave me that look,
so I knowyou don't like what I had on.

601
00:49:59,337 --> 00:50:01,999
- What is this?
- Whatyou wanted, isn't it?

602
00:50:02,073 --> 00:50:04,268
- A water glass with vodka in it.
- No, that was before.

603
00:50:04,342 --> 00:50:07,778
- Before what, sir?
- Beforeyou showed up. Get out ofhere.

604
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,343
I'm fine running around here
in these cute, short things foryou.

605
00:50:12,417 --> 00:50:14,112
I am submissive toyou.

606
00:50:14,185 --> 00:50:17,552
I ain't gonna be submissive to them
BrotherX's and Z's...

607
00:50:17,622 --> 00:50:19,487
about what they think.

608
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,118
They ask me a bunch
ofquestions all the time anyway.

609
00:50:22,193 --> 00:50:24,161
- What questions?
- Aboutyou and us.

610
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,959
- And I ain't telling them shit.
- You tell it like it is, sugar.

611
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:33,702
Took away my boy's name.
What they give him back?

612
00:50:33,772 --> 00:50:35,103
Bad style.

613
00:50:37,809 --> 00:50:42,143
I thinkyou drunk.
Daddy Clay, you're something else.

614
00:50:42,213 --> 00:50:45,705
Now, that's a firecracker right there.
We're gonna have to workwith that.

615
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:47,718
- A scale ofone to ten.
- That's right.

616
00:50:47,786 --> 00:50:49,947
I have one-- I had a ten--
Well, I didn't have a ten.

617
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:52,717
I had a five--
five good twos.

618
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:57,922
I don't drink. I don't smoke.
I converted to lslam foryou.

619
00:50:57,996 --> 00:51:00,863
Okay? l--
All except the dress.

620
00:52:41,633 --> 00:52:44,158
Whatyou doing in my pockets, man?
Getyour hand out ofmy pocket!

621
00:52:44,235 --> 00:52:46,465
- Hold it, my brothers.
- We got a thiefin here!

622
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,665
Just be cool.

623
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,298
Be cool.

624
00:53:42,127 --> 00:53:43,992
Brother, you crazy?

625
00:53:44,062 --> 00:53:47,463
They killed Malcolm!
They shot Malcolm! They shot Malcolm!

626
00:53:47,532 --> 00:53:49,466
They shot Malcolm!

627
00:53:51,302 --> 00:53:55,830
...washitseven times

629
00:53:58,576 --> 00:54:02,171
Apparently, the unknownman...

630
00:54:02,247 --> 00:54:05,774
walkedup
to thespeaker'splatform...

631
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:09,650
at the time
MalcolmXwas speaking...

632
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:14,751
openedfireathim
at veryshortrange.

633
00:55:21,826 --> 00:55:25,057
The arena is surrounded by FBl.

634
00:55:25,129 --> 00:55:27,620
The stands are only halffull.

635
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,726
The promoter has taken out
a million-dollar insurance policy...

636
00:55:31,803 --> 00:55:37,002
due to Cassius Clay's membership in
the militant and radical black Muslims.

637
00:55:37,075 --> 00:55:41,136
And, oh, by the way,
Sonny Liston is here too.

638
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,840
Touch gloves
and come out fighting.

639
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,972
Come on, son.

640
00:56:17,048 --> 00:56:19,778
- Come on, Chi-Chi.
- Put a whupping on him now.

641
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:27,885
Ain't nothing changed.

642
00:56:27,959 --> 00:56:30,325
Whup on him now.
Whup up on him.

643
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,796
Way to go!

644
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,536
- There it is!
- Sock it to him, baby!

645
00:56:48,746 --> 00:56:50,179
Yes!

646
00:56:50,248 --> 00:56:52,910
Get up!
Ain't nobody gonna believe this.

647
00:56:52,984 --> 00:56:55,077
Get up!

648
00:56:55,153 --> 00:56:56,313
Yes!

649
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,401
Confused.
We're confused.

650
00:57:13,037 --> 00:57:15,437
- Check his time.
- Timekeeper's sounding it's over.

651
00:57:15,506 --> 00:57:17,440
Check his time!

652
00:57:19,577 --> 00:57:20,669
It is over!

653
00:57:33,057 --> 00:57:35,491
I think the champ
was in a hurry.

654
00:57:44,135 --> 00:57:45,568
Areyou okay?

655
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:49,731
What's wrong?

656
00:57:49,807 --> 00:57:52,742
Whyyou all done up like that?

657
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:58,004
I'm out there dying foryou
out ofworry.

658
00:57:58,082 --> 00:57:59,572
- Worry?
- Yes.

659
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:02,084
And all you can think about
is ifl look dull enough?

660
00:58:02,887 --> 00:58:06,015
What ifl straightened my hair
and moved into some white suburb?

661
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,115
How I am says something.

662
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:34,616
You want me to go get her?

663
00:58:47,231 --> 00:58:48,391
Not now.

664
00:58:48,466 --> 00:58:50,400
- Not right now, fellas.
- Not now.

665
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,498
- What I got to do?
- About Sonji?

666
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,875
Have no contact with her
for 90 days.

667
00:59:01,946 --> 00:59:04,176
Make a public statement
ofdivorce at the mosque...

668
00:59:04,248 --> 00:59:06,443
and lslamic law
will be satisfied.

669
00:59:06,517 --> 00:59:09,975
Satisfaction is not making it with
the woman who send you to the moon?

670
00:59:10,054 --> 00:59:12,045
I'm the only normal person
left around here.

671
00:59:12,123 --> 00:59:14,683
I'm a blackJew, I can't read
and I'm halfdrunk.

672
00:59:16,861 --> 00:59:18,328
I need to talk toyou.

673
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:22,893
- No, you can stay, Brother Herbert.
- Brother? He ain'tyour brother.

674
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:26,164
Your brother's taking yourwife back
to Chicago. She's crying like a widow.

675
00:59:26,237 --> 00:59:28,933
- Well, I ain't dead.
- Well, you may as well be.

676
00:59:29,006 --> 00:59:31,531
You don't rememberyour name
orwhoyou are.

677
01:00:45,116 --> 01:00:47,710
You gonna try for Germany?

678
01:00:47,785 --> 01:00:49,514
You gonna try to get
stationed in Germany?

679
01:00:49,587 --> 01:00:54,354
- Everybody is trying to avoid Vietnam.
- Whatyou talkin' about, man?

680
01:00:54,425 --> 01:00:57,417
They changed your classification.
It's in the paper.

681
01:00:57,495 --> 01:00:59,292
- What?
- Champ. Eskridge.

682
01:00:59,363 --> 01:01:00,796
You're 1 A.

683
01:01:03,834 --> 01:01:06,302
They tryin' to draft me in the army?
You know about this?

684
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:07,598
Okay, here we go.

685
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:12,766
All right, all right.
Hey, I got to go.

686
01:01:16,681 --> 01:01:18,706
They started runnin'.

687
01:01:20,851 --> 01:01:20,985
You know, so I went down there,
I did everything I was supposed to do...

688
01:01:20,985 --> 01:01:23,545
You know, so I went down there,
I did everything I was supposed to do...

689
01:01:23,621 --> 01:01:25,555
and I flunked
their draft board test.

690
01:01:25,623 --> 01:01:29,719
Then without testing me again,
to see ifl'm anywiser orworser...

691
01:01:29,794 --> 01:01:32,228
they decide
I can go in the army?

692
01:01:32,296 --> 01:01:34,560
- Cassius, in my opinion--
- My name ain't Cassius Clay.

693
01:01:34,632 --> 01:01:37,192
That is a slave name,
and I am a free man.

694
01:01:37,268 --> 01:01:38,860
I am Muhammad Ali.

695
01:01:38,936 --> 01:01:44,203
You know, I apologize.
I apologize toyou on the air.

696
01:01:44,275 --> 01:01:46,470
Your name is Muhammad Ali.

697
01:01:46,544 --> 01:01:48,705
You have a right to be called
whateveryou want.

698
01:01:48,779 --> 01:01:50,713
I apologize toyou.

699
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:54,376
You sure make a lot ofmistakes
for a so-called educated man.

700
01:01:54,452 --> 01:01:56,852
- You reallywent to law school?
- Yes, Muhammad.

701
01:01:56,921 --> 01:02:00,687
And to think I gave up a lucrative
practice for the likes ofyou.

702
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:02,749
I'm the best thing
ever happened toyou, Cosell.

703
01:02:02,827 --> 01:02:06,661
Without me, you'd be a tall white man
with a microphone in his mouth.

704
01:02:06,731 --> 01:02:09,996
And without me,
you'd be a mouth.

705
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:18,841
We'll be right back.

706
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:23,907
- You want some food for that thing?
- How could you do such a thing?

707
01:02:23,981 --> 01:02:26,609
- 'Cause it's funny.
- To someoneyou revere.

708
01:02:26,684 --> 01:02:29,585
- That thing almost bit my finger off.
- Mr. Bundini...

709
01:02:29,654 --> 01:02:33,920
I'm glad you were here
to witness this-- this assault.

710
01:02:36,661 --> 01:02:39,289
Have a little coffee
with your sugar.

711
01:02:43,367 --> 01:02:45,301
They're coming afteryou...

712
01:02:45,369 --> 01:02:48,930
because they're scared of
black militancy in the inner cities.

713
01:02:50,374 --> 01:02:54,777
I ain't no H. Rap Brown.
I ain't no Stokely Carmichael.

714
01:02:54,845 --> 01:02:56,642
All they are is political.

715
01:02:56,714 --> 01:02:59,308
You're the heavyweight
champion ofthe world.

716
01:03:15,099 --> 01:03:17,226
Here's the deal the government offered.
You do six weeks in basic.

717
01:03:17,301 --> 01:03:19,826
You go to the reserves.
You don't go to Vietnam.

718
01:03:19,904 --> 01:03:22,839
Now, the messengerwould not object
ifyoujoined under those terms.

719
01:03:22,907 --> 01:03:24,704
I stay out ofjail and keep boxing.

720
01:03:24,775 --> 01:03:27,073
Ifyou accept the induction,
life goes on.

721
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:37,888
Marvin DeckerAnderson,
US Army.

722
01:03:37,888 --> 01:03:41,619
Marvin DeckerAnderson,
US Army.

723
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:46,922
Juan Raymondo Benitez,
US Army.

724
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:52,198
Pryce Marshall Benson,
US Marines.

725
01:03:56,674 --> 01:04:00,838
Cassius Marcellus Clay,
US Army.

726
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,853
Mr. Clay,
I'm required to inform you...

727
01:04:13,924 --> 01:04:16,893
that refusal to accept
a lawful induction order...

728
01:04:17,661 --> 01:04:19,891
constitutes a felony...

729
01:04:19,964 --> 01:04:23,661
under the Universal Military
Training and Service Act...

730
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:27,795
punishable by
fiveyears imprisonment...

731
01:04:27,872 --> 01:04:30,739
and a $1 0,000 fine.

732
01:04:30,808 --> 01:04:32,400
Doyou understand?

733
01:04:32,977 --> 01:04:35,343
Yes, sir.

734
01:04:55,065 --> 01:04:57,829
Federal Bureau oflnvestigation.

735
01:04:57,902 --> 01:05:00,735
Mr. Clay, you're under arrest
for refusing induction.

736
01:05:38,843 --> 01:05:40,868
Yeah.

737
01:05:40,945 --> 01:05:43,175
Yeah, this is me.

738
01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:46,978
No, you got to ask Chauncey Eskridge.
That's my lawyer. He's in Chicago.

739
01:05:48,786 --> 01:05:50,720
No, I'm out on bail.

740
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:56,190
No, man, I ain't never
shot nothin' in my life.

741
01:05:56,260 --> 01:06:00,196
No ducks, no geese,
no deer, no nothin'.

742
01:06:00,264 --> 01:06:03,893
Yeah, I know where Vietnam is.
It's on TV.

743
01:06:05,436 --> 01:06:09,236
Southeast Asia?
What, it's there too?

744
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,371
What do I think about who?

745
01:06:15,446 --> 01:06:17,004
The Vietcong?

746
01:06:19,316 --> 01:06:22,513
Man, I ain't got no quarrel
with them Vietcong.

747
01:06:24,121 --> 01:06:27,420
Ain't no Vietcong
ever called me nigger.

748
01:06:28,392 --> 01:06:30,417
Yeah, that's right.

749
01:06:35,399 --> 01:06:38,061
You know whatyou're doin', Ali?

750
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,133
You know whatyoujust said?

751
01:06:41,805 --> 01:06:43,864
Everyone, Europe to China,
every home in America...

752
01:06:43,941 --> 01:06:45,966
everyone's gonna know what the
heavyweight champion ofthe world...

753
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:48,170
said about the US war.

754
01:06:49,947 --> 01:06:52,939
So what? So what?
I ain't got to be...

755
01:06:53,017 --> 01:06:54,985
what nobody else
want me to be...

756
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,714
and I ain't afraid to be
what I wanna be...

757
01:06:57,788 --> 01:06:59,779
think how I wanna think.

758
01:07:18,742 --> 01:07:21,734
I got almost nowhere I can
promote a fight foryou.

759
01:07:21,812 --> 01:07:24,246
Plus I think they're gonna
vacateyou from the crown.

760
01:07:24,315 --> 01:07:26,579
- What?
- Yeah, ifyou're convicted.

761
01:07:28,218 --> 01:07:31,449
Oh, so they're gonna take from me
what no fighter in the world can.

762
01:07:31,522 --> 01:07:33,490
And New York may revoke
your boxing license.

763
01:07:33,557 --> 01:07:36,549
You sureyou wanna do this?

764
01:07:36,627 --> 01:07:39,721
The next three to fouryears
are every heavyweight's prime.

765
01:07:39,797 --> 01:07:42,664
There are few ofthoseyears.

766
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:48,530
- What about Terrell?
- We'll know about that this afternoon.

767
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:51,871
I gotta find us some venues fast.
I'll call you later.

768
01:07:56,513 --> 01:08:02,076
You understand the issue is your
license to fight Terrell in Illinois?

769
01:08:02,152 --> 01:08:03,744
Yes.

770
01:08:03,821 --> 01:08:06,085
Then areyou prepared
to apologize...

771
01:08:06,156 --> 01:08:08,852
aboutyour unpatriotic remarks
about the war?

772
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,964
- You sayyou're the people's champion.
- Yes, sir.

773
01:08:21,038 --> 01:08:23,529
Doyou thinkyou're acting
like the people's champion?

774
01:08:23,607 --> 01:08:26,667
Yes, sir.
I'm not gonna apologize toyou.

775
01:08:26,744 --> 01:08:30,305
This is not a courtroom, and I do not
have to answeryour questions.

776
01:08:39,223 --> 01:08:42,090
- What about Terrell?
- We'll fight in another state!

777
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:44,559
- Areyou gonna dodge the draft?
- I ain't draft-dodgin'...

778
01:08:44,628 --> 01:08:47,119
I ain't burnin' no flag,
and I ain't runnin' to Canada.

779
01:08:47,197 --> 01:08:50,166
I'm stayin' right here.
You wanna send me tojail?

780
01:08:50,234 --> 01:08:52,532
Fine. You go right ahead.
I've been injail for 400 years.

781
01:08:52,603 --> 01:08:54,537
I can be there
for four or five more.

782
01:08:54,605 --> 01:08:56,539
But I ain't goin'
no 1 0,000 miles...

783
01:08:56,607 --> 01:08:59,132
to help murder and kill
other poor people.

784
01:08:59,209 --> 01:09:03,509
Ifl wanna die, I'll die right here
right now, fightin' you, ifl wanna die.

785
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:07,516
You my enemy. Not no Chinese,
no Vietcong, noJapanese.

786
01:09:07,584 --> 01:09:09,643
You my opposer
when I want freedom.

787
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:13,417
You my opposerwhen I wantjustice.
You my opposerwhen I want equality.

788
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:15,219
You want me to go somewhere
and fight foryou.

789
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:17,283
You won't even stand up for me
right here in America...

790
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:19,295
for my rights
and my religious beliefs.

791
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:21,695
You won't even stand up for me
right here at home.

792
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:26,260
- Which guyyou want to go first?
- You, sir.

793
01:09:26,336 --> 01:09:29,305
Tell Clay he gettin' on after me.
I'm the champ.

794
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:32,240
- What?
- I said you can get on after me.

795
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:35,005
- No. What'd you call me?
- I called you Clay.

796
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:37,639
You will announce it from right here,
from flat on your back.

797
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:39,740
What's my name?
What's my name?

798
01:09:41,618 --> 01:09:45,645
What's my name? Say my name!
You gonna say my name!

799
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:48,385
Your mama called you Clay!
I'm gonna call you Clay!

800
01:09:48,459 --> 01:09:50,484
I wantyou all to tell
all their aunts...

801
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:52,529
and all their uncles
and cousins and friends...

802
01:09:52,596 --> 01:09:55,087
get toyour television set,
get toyour radio...

803
01:09:55,165 --> 01:09:57,725
'cause I neverwanted
to whup a man so bad!

804
01:10:11,815 --> 01:10:14,613
What's my name?
What's my name?

805
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:14,368
What's my name, motherfucker?
What's my name?

806
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:19,373
What's my name?

807
01:11:39,136 --> 01:11:41,468
Thejury has found you guilty
ofrefusing induction...

808
01:11:41,538 --> 01:11:44,837
into the United States
Armed Forces.

809
01:11:44,908 --> 01:11:46,967
Does the defense have anything
it wants to say?

810
01:11:47,044 --> 01:11:50,445
Yeah, I'd appreciate ifthe court would
just give me my sentence right now...

811
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:53,847
rather than waitin' and stallin'.

812
01:11:53,917 --> 01:11:55,441
Verywell.

813
01:11:58,222 --> 01:12:01,658
I sentenceyou to
the maximum sentence allowable:

814
01:12:01,725 --> 01:12:04,956
fiveyears imprisonment
and a fine of$1 0,000.

815
01:12:06,563 --> 01:12:08,622
Doubtless your lawyer
will lodge an appeal...

816
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,964
so whileyou're free on bond, I order
thatyour passport be surrendered.

817
01:12:12,769 --> 01:12:17,468
I'll not haveyou benefiting yourself
by fighting abroad.

818
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:19,634
This court is adjourned.

819
01:12:59,249 --> 01:12:59,283
Hold on. Watch this.
I've been working on this at home.

820
01:12:59,283 --> 01:13:02,844
Hold on. Watch this.
I've been working on this at home.

821
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,945
Just relax.

822
01:13:05,022 --> 01:13:08,389
See? 'Cause it's spooky and sometimes
people get scared and run.

823
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:10,688
Pay attention.
This is very spooky.

824
01:13:13,363 --> 01:13:15,695
Go ahead.
Blow on that for me.

825
01:13:21,805 --> 01:13:23,705
See, you don't need
to fight no more.

826
01:13:27,511 --> 01:13:30,105
You don't remember me, doyou?

827
01:13:31,982 --> 01:13:36,180
Yeah. I remember somethin'.
What's your name?

828
01:13:36,253 --> 01:13:38,585
- You know my name.
- I knowyour name.

829
01:13:38,655 --> 01:13:42,056
You came to my school
right beforeyou won the title.

830
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:44,787
I interviewed you
for my school paper.

831
01:13:44,861 --> 01:13:47,091
I was eleven.

832
01:13:48,165 --> 01:13:50,565
You had a long braid.

833
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:52,625
Yeah.

834
01:13:52,703 --> 01:13:55,570
- You called me "Little lndian Girl."
- Wow.

835
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:59,101
- Man, that was you.
- That was me.

836
01:14:00,344 --> 01:14:03,643
And I loved you then,
just like all them kids did.

837
01:14:03,714 --> 01:14:05,978
I never stopped.
I still do.

838
01:15:10,847 --> 01:15:13,213
Hey, did you see
that Ellis-Quarry fight?

839
01:15:13,283 --> 01:15:15,148
Yeah.

840
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:20,383
We're gonna be in front of
the US Court ofAppeals next month.

841
01:15:20,457 --> 01:15:21,481
We're gonna lose.

842
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:24,493
- We'll appeal to the Supreme Court.
-Jimmy Ellis, the champ.

843
01:15:24,561 --> 01:15:27,257
Man, I've been whupping on that boy
since I was 1 6.

844
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:29,958
All that's gonna happen,
they gonna give Ellis to Frazier...

845
01:15:30,033 --> 01:15:32,661
Frazier's gonna kill him,
then what?

846
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:35,796
Where's the gate?
Then they got to let me fight.

847
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:41,199
Jimmy Ellis.
Fight that boy in a phone booth.

848
01:15:41,278 --> 01:15:45,271
Fight him in the middle ofTimes Square.
You think that'd draw a crowd?

849
01:15:45,348 --> 01:15:48,909
Champ, draw a crowd
or not draw a crowd...

850
01:15:48,985 --> 01:15:51,681
it's not gonna make a difference
with your boxing licenses.

851
01:15:55,292 --> 01:15:58,056
The ACLU's handling your case
against the New York Boxing Commission.

852
01:15:58,128 --> 01:16:00,858
They've discovered that New York's
got actual ex-murderers...

853
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:03,559
and ex-rapists
currently licensed to fight.

854
01:16:03,633 --> 01:16:06,067
But revokeyours?

855
01:16:06,136 --> 01:16:09,401
They don't wantyou to fight.

856
01:16:09,473 --> 01:16:10,804
- Tijuana.
- No.

857
01:16:10,874 --> 01:16:13,741
State Department refuses permission
for the one-hourvisa.

858
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:16,574
No fight in Tijuana.
Look--

859
01:16:16,646 --> 01:16:20,013
Can't fight here.
Can't fight outside the country.

860
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:22,017
I know people
in the restaurant business.

861
01:16:22,085 --> 01:16:24,610
Theywant to start a chain.
Muhammad Ali Champ Burgers.

862
01:16:24,688 --> 01:16:27,020
Muhammad Malts,
Fistful of Fries.

863
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:28,955
All ofthat.

864
01:16:29,025 --> 01:16:31,050
Why do I wanna be
in the restaurant business?

865
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:32,425
'Causeyou need the money.

866
01:16:32,496 --> 01:16:35,397
- How much all this gonna cost?
- Too much.

867
01:16:37,234 --> 01:16:39,634
They do that toyou too, you know.

868
01:16:39,703 --> 01:16:41,671
They bustyou out.

869
01:16:54,784 --> 01:16:55,808
All right.

870
01:16:59,823 --> 01:17:02,291
Go get me some
Champ Burgers.

871
01:17:12,702 --> 01:17:14,636

That manjust hit me.

872
01:17:14,704 --> 01:17:18,231
Oh, you done messed up now, sucka.
You done messed up--

873
01:17:18,308 --> 01:17:20,606
I don't wanna do nothin'
in front ofyour daughters, though.

874
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:22,838
I can't beatyou up
in front ofyour daughters.

875
01:17:22,913 --> 01:17:26,713
- Hey, champ, good to seeyou.
- All right, ladies. Take care now.

876
01:17:26,783 --> 01:17:28,842
All right now.
All right now.

877
01:17:39,729 --> 01:17:43,358
You called me "Little lndian Girl"
'cause I wore my hair in a braid.

878
01:17:45,735 --> 01:17:47,669
And then I said,
"Man, you scribble.

879
01:17:49,139 --> 01:17:50,766
You can't even write.

880
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,308
Need to go back to school
till you learn how to do it better."

881
01:17:53,376 --> 01:17:56,777
Now, whyyoujust havin'
a fresh mouth talkin' to me.

882
01:17:56,846 --> 01:17:58,837
Soyou think that's funny, huh?

883
01:17:58,915 --> 01:18:01,713
Telling me I can't write,
that I scribble.

884
01:18:02,452 --> 01:18:04,613
Nowyou wanna try
to make up with me.

885
01:18:04,688 --> 01:18:07,851
- This will make everything better.
- Shut up.

886
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:29,204
Mommy and Daddy
moved to Mexico!

887
01:18:47,297 --> 01:18:49,231
Come on, baby.

888
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:52,460
Oh, sweetie, come on.

889
01:19:06,149 --> 01:19:09,710

Whois theheavyweightchampion

891
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:29,161
What's happenin'?

892
01:19:44,087 --> 01:19:46,555
- Hey, man.
- We lost on the appellate level...

893
01:19:46,623 --> 01:19:47,851
in New Orleans.

894
01:19:47,924 --> 01:19:50,757
- We'reheading to theSupreme Court.
- We already got turned down there.

895
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:55,628
I'm petitioning on a conscientious
objection basis. Religious belief.

896
01:19:55,699 --> 01:19:58,862
Ibelieve that they'llhearthat.

897
01:19:58,935 --> 01:20:01,961
Where themoney

898
01:20:02,038 --> 01:20:05,701
Herbertsayl'm runnin'on empty.
Now,justputaside...

899
01:20:05,775 --> 01:20:07,538
"How did that happen?"

900
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:12,479
License all revoked, passport gone,
can't fight here, can't fight nowhere.

901
01:20:12,549 --> 01:20:14,608
Then what happen ifl lose
at the Supreme Court?

902
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,418
Then you go tojail for fiveyears.

903
01:21:35,131 --> 01:21:37,895
Oh, I saw Bundini
when I was in Europe.

904
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:42,404
- Yeah? How is he?
- He's bad. He's in bad shape, man.

905
01:21:42,472 --> 01:21:45,373
You better getyour belt back

906
01:21:49,546 --> 01:21:52,344
Look at this.

907
01:21:52,415 --> 01:21:54,883
Joe Frazier.
He can't up no gate.

908
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:57,977
Can't fill no arena.
They got to let me fight.

909
01:21:58,054 --> 01:21:59,612
Fight.

910
01:22:02,992 --> 01:22:08,328
Ifthat happens, promise meyou'll
put some new people around you.

911
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,000
Whatyou talkin' about?

912
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:16,400
Where Herbert and them
when we need 'em?

913
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:20,807
Gene Kilroy's dropping offgroceries
like charity.

914
01:22:23,012 --> 01:22:26,175
We borrow money from my folks.

915
01:22:26,249 --> 01:22:30,686
They're all overyou when you got it,
and then theyjust drop offyou...

916
01:22:30,753 --> 01:22:32,448
when you don't.

917
01:22:45,902 --> 01:22:48,837
Norton, he's big and strong,
but he ain't nothin'.

918
01:22:48,905 --> 01:22:52,136
Hold on a second,Joe.
They're telling me we have a caller.

919
01:22:52,208 --> 01:22:55,541
- Go ahead, please.
- Cosell, this is MuhammadAli.

920
01:22:55,612 --> 01:22:56,874
It's Muhammad Ali.

921
01:22:56,946 --> 01:22:59,039
Everybody knows
that I am the champ.

922
01:22:59,115 --> 01:23:02,516
The crown is a lie. I know it's a lie.
Joe Frazier knows it's a lie.

923
01:23:02,585 --> 01:23:04,951
And it's time for everybody
to stop lying and tell the truth.

924
01:23:05,021 --> 01:23:08,388
Let's tellitlikeitis.
Withyourcourtandboxingproblems...

925
01:23:08,458 --> 01:23:10,483
canyougeta fightpromoted?

926
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,755
I would fightJoe Frazier for free
in a phone booth...

927
01:23:12,829 --> 01:23:15,229
in the middle ofTimes Square
ifl wasn't broke.

928
01:23:15,298 --> 01:23:17,493
Didyousayyou werebroke?
Howcanyoubebroke?

929
01:23:17,567 --> 01:23:21,003
Youmademoremoney thanallprevious
heavyweights champions combined.

930
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:23,595
Whataboutyourmanagement?
Surely theyhaveprovidedforyou.

931
01:23:23,673 --> 01:23:26,836
AIll'm trying tosayisit's time
foreverybodytostop lyin'.

932
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:28,605
MuhammadAliis the champ.

933
01:23:28,678 --> 01:23:31,738
Get my son Herbert
on the telephone.

934
01:23:31,814 --> 01:23:34,647
Muhammad, thankyou for calling in.
I'll relay that toJoe.

935
01:23:34,717 --> 01:23:38,881
And telIJoe I said
he is very ugly.

936
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:43,521
Muhammadsays thathe will
fightyouanywhere, anytime...

937
01:23:43,593 --> 01:23:48,360
andthat the championship reallyishis
until thatbattle ensues.

938
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:04,979
Mr. Ali has sporting blood.

939
01:24:05,048 --> 01:24:08,142
Mr. Ali wants a place
in this sports world.

940
01:24:08,217 --> 01:24:10,981
He loves it too much.

941
01:24:11,054 --> 01:24:15,548
I am therefore suspending Mr. Ali
from the practice oflslam.

942
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:19,789
He may no longer appear in temple,
pray or teach...

943
01:24:19,862 --> 01:24:24,925
or have any conversation
with any Muslim whatsoever.

944
01:24:28,571 --> 01:24:30,163
Why didn'tyou call
an ambulance or a doctor?

945
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,867
Because he gave meyour number
when he checked in.

946
01:24:32,942 --> 01:24:35,137
Normally, he's up there
making a lot ofnoise.

947
01:24:35,211 --> 01:24:37,702
But now he hasn't answered the door
in three days.

948
01:24:41,150 --> 01:24:42,879
- What's that?
- It's daylight.

949
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:46,388
Get me that short dog.

950
01:24:48,891 --> 01:24:51,257
Give it to me.

951
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:55,056
What's wrong with you?

952
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:57,998
Ain't nothin' wrong with me.
My head ain't bad.

953
01:24:58,067 --> 01:25:00,001
- Leave me alone.
- Leaveyou alone. You called me!

954
01:25:00,069 --> 01:25:02,663
Yes, but that was a week ago.

955
01:25:02,739 --> 01:25:04,969
- Why areyou shamin' yourself?
- Let me go, man.

956
01:25:05,041 --> 01:25:06,804
Whyyou doin' that
toyourself?

957
01:25:06,876 --> 01:25:09,572
- Whyyou shamin' yourself?
- Ain't nobody shamed.

958
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:11,910
Ain't nothin' wrong with me.

959
01:25:11,981 --> 01:25:13,812
I'm flyin'.

960
01:25:13,883 --> 01:25:15,976
The Sky Chieftalk through me.
I know the word.

961
01:25:16,052 --> 01:25:17,417
- You know low.
- Yeah?

962
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:19,717
I know low where the king
is goin' back to his throne!

963
01:25:19,789 --> 01:25:22,587
- From the root to the fruit!
- Them rhymes is old, Bundini.

964
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:24,593
You need to get some new ones.

965
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:32,332
God don't care aboutyou.
Don't care about me.

966
01:25:32,402 --> 01:25:35,633
In all ofeverything, we don't mean
nothin'. He don't owe us.

967
01:25:35,705 --> 01:25:37,400
We be.

968
01:25:37,473 --> 01:25:40,806
And that's the onliest thing He did.

969
01:25:40,877 --> 01:25:43,937
But that's good.
That's whywe free.

970
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:47,847
But free ain't easy. Free is real
and real is a motherfucker.

971
01:25:50,086 --> 01:25:52,850
It eats raw meat.

972
01:25:52,922 --> 01:25:55,482
It walk in its own shoes.

973
01:25:55,558 --> 01:25:58,026
It don't everwaiver.

974
01:25:58,094 --> 01:25:59,561
Yeah.

975
01:26:05,501 --> 01:26:08,402
I-- I sold your belt.

976
01:26:09,772 --> 01:26:12,741
I sold your belt to a barber
for $500 on Lenox Avenue.

977
01:26:12,809 --> 01:26:16,336
That's how low I did you.
I couldn't help it. I got a crazy mind.

978
01:26:18,614 --> 01:26:20,741
That belt sayyou the heavyweight
boxing champion ofthe world...

979
01:26:20,817 --> 01:26:23,752
and I took that $500...

980
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:26,254
and I put it in my arm.

981
01:26:28,091 --> 01:26:30,116
That's what I called to tell you.

982
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,699
I heard about the Nation stuff,
the courtroom.

983
01:26:42,605 --> 01:26:44,539
Whatyou gonna do?

984
01:26:55,551 --> 01:26:57,416
Take me back.

985
01:27:05,828 --> 01:27:08,991
I could go down there and get the belt.
I can go get the belt.

986
01:27:48,838 --> 01:27:50,772
Hey, champ.

987
01:28:24,373 --> 01:28:30,278
$1 ,000 to the man that bring me
Howard Cosell's toupee dead or alive!

988
01:28:30,346 --> 01:28:32,940
Don't bother me.
I'm a world-famous sportscaster...

989
01:28:33,015 --> 01:28:35,313
and you're an ex-champion
with diminished skills.

990
01:28:35,384 --> 01:28:37,113
I can't be seen with you.

991
01:28:40,523 --> 01:28:43,287
- How's it goin', champ?
- Pretty good, man.

992
01:28:49,065 --> 01:28:52,398
Muhammad, I'd do anything foryou.
You know that.

993
01:28:52,468 --> 01:28:57,929
But I've got bosses who only
give a damn about Nielsen ratings.

994
01:28:58,007 --> 01:29:00,669
I guarantee...

995
01:29:00,743 --> 01:29:04,543
it will be a historical
and a momentous night.

996
01:29:10,586 --> 01:29:13,987
Ifthey came to me tomorrow and say,
"We wantyou to fightJoe Frazier.

997
01:29:14,056 --> 01:29:17,025
Madison Square Garden.
Millions and millions ofdollars.

998
01:29:17,093 --> 01:29:19,687
Here's your license back."
I will tell them...

999
01:29:19,762 --> 01:29:21,525
"I will never fight again."

1000
01:29:21,597 --> 01:29:25,033
Frankly, Muhammad, I'm surprised,
because unless you--

1001
01:29:25,101 --> 01:29:27,569
or until you fight Frazier--

1002
01:29:27,637 --> 01:29:31,596
Cosell, areyou losin' your hearing
along with your hair?

1003
01:29:31,674 --> 01:29:34,734
Don't put no question to it, man.
I done told you, I'm through fightin'.

1004
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:37,210
I got a much bigger contender,
a much heavier opponent.

1005
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,180
I'm fightin'
the entire US government.

1006
01:29:40,449 --> 01:29:42,940
Doyou think
you're going tojail?

1007
01:29:43,019 --> 01:29:45,681
I don't know. I don't know.

1008
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:51,352
Joe Frazier told me on this show
that he could knockyou out.

1009
01:29:51,427 --> 01:29:53,691
See, thereyou go agitatin'.

1010
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:57,631
You should've asked Smokin'Joe
what have he been smokin'?

1011
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:01,466
That boy even dream he whupped me,
he betterwake up and apologize.

1012
01:30:01,537 --> 01:30:03,596
Ifl was togetin thering withJoe...

1013
01:30:03,673 --> 01:30:05,607
here's whatyoumightsee.

1014
01:30:05,675 --> 01:30:10,374
Ali comes out to meet Frazier,
but Frazier starts to retreat.

1015
01:30:10,446 --> 01:30:14,678
IfJoe goes back an inch farther,
he'll wind up in a ringside seat.

1016
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:17,913
Ali swings with his left,
Ali swings with his right.

1017
01:30:17,987 --> 01:30:20,148
Just look at the kid
carry the fight.

1018
01:30:20,222 --> 01:30:22,816
Frazier keeps backin',
but there's not enough room.

1019
01:30:22,892 --> 01:30:26,384
It's only a matter oftime
before Ali lowers the boom.

1020
01:30:26,462 --> 01:30:29,260
Aliswings withhis right.
Whatabeautifulswing.

1021
01:30:29,332 --> 01:30:32,233
But thepunch lifts Frazier
clean outofthering.

1022
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:35,099
Frazier's still risin',
and the referee wears a frown...

1023
01:30:35,171 --> 01:30:38,538
'cause he can't start countin'
till Frazier comes down.

1024
01:30:38,607 --> 01:30:41,974
Frazier's disappeared from view.
The crowd is getting frantic.

1025
01:30:42,044 --> 01:30:46,003
But our radar stations picked him up.
He's somewheres over the Atlantic.

1026
01:30:46,082 --> 01:30:48,346
Now, who would've thought
when they came to the fight...

1027
01:30:48,417 --> 01:30:52,376
theywas gonna witness the launchin'
ofa black satellite.

1028
01:30:52,455 --> 01:30:54,980
But don't wait for that fight.

1029
01:30:55,057 --> 01:30:57,218
It ain't never gonna happen.

1030
01:30:57,293 --> 01:30:59,386
Onliest thingyoucoulddo...

1031
01:30:59,462 --> 01:31:02,989
is wonderandimagine.

1032
01:31:03,566 --> 01:31:09,402
This has been another
sports exclusive from ABC.

1033
01:31:09,472 --> 01:31:11,497
- Two. Go two.
- OvertoJim McKay...

1034
01:31:11,574 --> 01:31:13,838

1035
01:31:13,909 --> 01:31:16,104
- Howyou gonna go from me toJim McKay?
- Listen, uh--

1036
01:31:17,346 --> 01:31:21,009
- Did yourwife leaveyou yet?
- No, she hasn't left meyet.

1037
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:23,415
She's going to, 'cause I
told yourwife when I seen her...

1038
01:31:23,486 --> 01:31:26,751
I said, "Listen, whyyou
doin' this toyourself?"

1039
01:31:35,898 --> 01:31:39,493
Oh, man,Joe.
Who dresses you?

1040
01:31:39,568 --> 01:31:42,435
You look like the heavyweight
champion ofpimps.

1041
01:31:42,505 --> 01:31:44,564
Hey, shut up and get in.

1042
01:31:45,841 --> 01:31:47,399
Thatjacket's a mess, man.

1043
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,205
Whatyou in Philly for?
Philly's my town.

1044
01:31:54,283 --> 01:31:57,275
Well, I just wanted to get
a little closer toyou, honey.

1045
01:31:57,353 --> 01:31:58,377
Man, fuckyou.

1046
01:32:00,723 --> 01:32:04,159
There'll be two undefeated heavyweight
champions, and they ain't fightin'.

1047
01:32:04,226 --> 01:32:06,922
- What aboutyour license?
- I can fight in Atlanta.

1048
01:32:06,996 --> 01:32:09,658
There ain't no state boxing commission
in Georgia.

1049
01:32:09,732 --> 01:32:12,997
It's all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta
againstJerry Quarry...

1050
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:15,663
but we got to get this
steamroller movin' right now.

1051
01:32:15,738 --> 01:32:17,330
So what do I have to do?

1052
01:32:17,406 --> 01:32:20,807
All you got to do is announce
that after I whupJerry Quarry...

1053
01:32:20,876 --> 01:32:23,401
you gonna give me a title shot.

1054
01:32:23,479 --> 01:32:26,107
Come on, man.
Say it! Say it!

1055
01:32:34,857 --> 01:32:38,384
What I got and all I got,
I got with these right here.

1056
01:32:38,461 --> 01:32:40,725
Hell, man, I already got the title.

1057
01:32:40,796 --> 01:32:45,324
So I ain't got nothin' to win,
but I got everythin' to lose.

1058
01:32:46,902 --> 01:32:49,302
Yeah, butyou know
you ain't the real champyet.

1059
01:32:58,447 --> 01:33:00,540
You beat Quarry...

1060
01:33:00,616 --> 01:33:03,710
I'm gonna getyou in the ring.
I'm gonna kickyour ass.

1061
01:33:14,663 --> 01:33:17,029
By the way...

1062
01:33:17,099 --> 01:33:21,502
you need any money
or anything to tideyou by?

1063
01:33:22,905 --> 01:33:24,839
No, I'm fine.

1064
01:33:39,755 --> 01:33:42,223
Time!

1065
01:33:49,765 --> 01:33:52,393
Whatyou want?

1066
01:33:54,937 --> 01:33:56,905
Take me back, boss.

1067
01:33:58,641 --> 01:34:00,575
I'm clean.

1068
01:34:00,643 --> 01:34:05,046
This is a resurrection.
This is God's act.

1069
01:34:05,114 --> 01:34:08,311
And the prophet is goin' home.

1070
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:10,716
Take me with you, boss.

1071
01:34:11,754 --> 01:34:13,847
I'll do anything.

1072
01:34:24,333 --> 01:34:28,235
Your hands can't hit
whatyour eyes can't see.

1073
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:35,074
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

1074
01:34:35,144 --> 01:34:37,578
Rumble, young man, rumble.

1075
01:34:55,965 --> 01:34:56,131
God ain't watchin'!
Ain't nobody but us!

1076
01:34:56,131 --> 01:34:59,692
God ain't watchin'!
Ain't nobody but us!

1077
01:35:06,809 --> 01:35:09,642
There it is!
Stay in his face!

1078
01:35:13,515 --> 01:35:15,380
Go, Muhammad!

1079
01:35:26,862 --> 01:35:28,193
There it is!

1080
01:35:34,436 --> 01:35:36,028
Now for the right. Boom!

1081
01:35:42,378 --> 01:35:44,369
Prophet is goin' home
to the throne.

1082
01:36:01,163 --> 01:36:03,358
That's howyou do it, Ali.

1083
01:36:03,432 --> 01:36:05,696
That's howyou do it.

1084
01:36:12,808 --> 01:36:15,368
You okay?
You're a goddamn Superman.

1085
01:36:15,444 --> 01:36:17,708
Ain't no kryptonite
in this ring tonight.

1086
01:37:02,091 --> 01:37:04,321
- We wantJoe Frazier!
- We want him!

1087
01:37:04,393 --> 01:37:08,921
- We wantJoe Frazier!
- And you deserve it. You deserve it.

1088
01:37:12,634 --> 01:37:15,694
This prophet is comin' home,
goin' from the darkness to the light.

1089
01:37:18,474 --> 01:37:20,738
Soak it in this
for about 20 minutes.

1090
01:37:22,845 --> 01:37:25,712
We don't need their management.

1091
01:37:26,648 --> 01:37:30,049
Hey, Herbert, we did good.
Doin' good tonight.

1092
01:37:41,697 --> 01:37:43,460
All praise to Allah.

1093

The messenger has lifted
your suspension.

1094
01:37:49,638 --> 01:37:51,572
Congratulations.

1095
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:53,665
Soyou're sayin'
I can be a Muslim again.

1096
01:37:53,742 --> 01:37:55,334
- Yes.
- I ain't never stopped.

1097
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:57,345
Just like I ain't never stopped
bein' the champ.

1098
01:37:59,548 --> 01:38:01,243
I begged my father
to reinstateyou.

1099
01:38:01,316 --> 01:38:04,114
When? When you do that, Herbert?

1100
01:38:04,186 --> 01:38:06,620
After I promoted this Quarry fight
or after I won it?

1101
01:38:07,556 --> 01:38:09,615
- We can get Frazier.
- Man, I done already got Frazier.

1102
01:38:09,691 --> 01:38:12,182
We can get $5 million for Frazier.

1103
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:15,355
We talkin' management,
talkin' money or talkin' religion?

1104
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:18,423
When I got leery
and talked up why I'm broke...

1105
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,058
then come the suspension.

1106
01:38:20,135 --> 01:38:23,662
Nowyou explain that one to me,
my brother.

1107
01:38:23,739 --> 01:38:25,934
That was my father.

1108
01:38:28,477 --> 01:38:30,411
Your father.

1109
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:34,609
I loveyour father, Herbert.
I swear, man. I love the Nation.

1110
01:38:34,683 --> 01:38:37,151
But it don't own me.

1111
01:38:46,295 --> 01:38:49,025
You go on out there
and you make that Frazier deal.

1112
01:38:54,303 --> 01:38:56,203
My brother.
Yeah, your brother Herbert.

1113
01:38:56,271 --> 01:38:58,171
Go on somewhere,
make that deal.

1114
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:12,049
And he accepts me.
I'mJewish, butyet he's Muslim...

1115
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,610
and we still get along.

1116
01:39:13,689 --> 01:39:17,181
He understands me. He understands me
and he still allows me to hang with him.

1117
01:39:17,259 --> 01:39:20,717
He knows I like pork and white women,
but still allows me to be here with him.

1118
01:39:20,796 --> 01:39:22,764
Now, I can give up pork...

1119
01:39:22,831 --> 01:39:25,629

1134
01:40:49,351 --> 01:40:51,819
What areyou talkin' about?

1135

Now the power's comin' to the truth.
That's what it is.

1143
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,314
And the truth tastes good

Muhammad, you said
you were gonna win the fight.

1167
01:45:26,928 --> 01:45:28,953
How doyou account
for the beating you've taken?

1168
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:31,726
- Did he hurtyou?
-Joe said you don't wanna fight again.

1169
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:34,360
Oh, how wrong he is.

1170
01:45:34,436 --> 01:45:35,994
- Whywould it be different?
- Muhammad, wait!

1171
01:45:41,076 --> 01:45:44,375
- But I wanna ask him something!
- We all wanna ask him something.

1172
01:45:44,446 --> 01:45:47,040
- Sons ofbitches! Get outta here!
- When areyou gonna get a hairpiece?

1173
01:45:47,115 --> 01:45:49,106
Don't worry about it.
You lost all ofyours.

1174
01:45:49,184 --> 01:45:51,152
You cue ball head motherfucker.
Get outta here!

1175
01:45:51,219 --> 01:45:53,585
-Just one more question.
- Let me talk to him.

1176
01:45:53,655 --> 01:45:55,919
We're close to thestart
ofroundone.

1177
01:45:55,991 --> 01:45:57,856
Now that Smokin'Joe
done run outta tomato cans...

1178
01:45:57,926 --> 01:46:01,487
I got Yank to commit to a rematch
with you in about six months.

1179
01:46:01,563 --> 01:46:03,758
Frazier said he'd be happy
with three mil.

1180
01:46:03,832 --> 01:46:08,269
I'll fly toJamaica, get Yank to sign
right afterJoe beats this big stiff.

1181
01:46:09,738 --> 01:46:12,263
I thinkhehurtJoe Frazier.

1182
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:15,002
I thinkJoeishurt.

1183
01:46:15,076 --> 01:46:18,637
Downgoes Frazier!
Downgoes Frazier!

1184
01:46:18,713 --> 01:46:20,510
- Downgoes Frazier!
- Get up,Joe.

1185
01:46:20,582 --> 01:46:24,143
Theheavyweightchampionis

AndFrazieris down again!

1189
01:46:34,062 --> 01:46:36,622
Hemaybe--
No, he's rising.

1190
01:46:38,533 --> 01:46:39,864
It's over!ltis over!

1191
01:46:39,935 --> 01:46:43,268
It'd be easy to get a fight
with Frazier now.

1192
01:46:43,338 --> 01:46:47,604
Only thing he's champion of
is gettin' knocked down.

1193
01:46:47,676 --> 01:46:51,635
George Foremanis
theheavyweightchampion ofthe world.

1194
01:46:53,448 --> 01:46:57,407
The Rumble in theJungle.
That is the name that I've given it.

1195
01:46:57,485 --> 01:47:02,013
Muhammad Ali and George Foreman
in Kinshasa, Zaire.

1196
01:47:02,090 --> 01:47:04,115
- Don, Zaire?
- Yeah, Don.

1197
01:47:04,192 --> 01:47:06,592
I mean, why not Antarctica,
somethin' like that?

1198
01:47:06,661 --> 01:47:08,754
What's wrong with New York City?

1199
01:47:10,598 --> 01:47:12,657
Becauseyou miss the significance.

1200
01:47:12,734 --> 01:47:16,966
See, I dream ofovercoming
400 years ofracial depression...

1201
01:47:17,038 --> 01:47:21,270
to the dawn ofa new day ofliberation,
financial and otherwise.

1202
01:47:21,343 --> 01:47:24,471
It will raise up the spirits
ofour inner cities.

1203
01:47:24,546 --> 01:47:27,037
It will rise up and fill with hope,
the souls...

1204
01:47:27,115 --> 01:47:29,709
the unrequited needs
ofthe black proletariat.

1205
01:47:29,784 --> 01:47:32,651
That is, the discouraged, dispirited,
denigrated denizens...

1206
01:47:32,721 --> 01:47:35,713
ofthe demimonde
that is called the ghetto.

1207
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:38,588
Man, Don, you crazy.

1208
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:42,596
You must've studied the whole
"D" section ofthe dictionary.

1209
01:48:07,222 --> 01:48:09,156
Good morning, sister.

1210
01:48:11,593 --> 01:48:13,254
Hi, brother.

1211
01:48:15,263 --> 01:48:17,128
Howyou doin', champ?

1212
01:48:44,325 --> 01:48:46,418
Why they saying that?
What they sayin'?

1213
01:48:50,765 --> 01:48:52,858
What that mean?
I don't understand.

1214
01:48:52,934 --> 01:48:54,492
- It means--
- What?

1215
01:48:54,569 --> 01:48:57,970
It mean, "Ali, kill him.
Ali, kill him."

1216
01:49:44,552 --> 01:49:47,316
The champ is here!

1217
01:49:47,388 --> 01:49:51,188
Ladies and gentlemen, the heavyweight
champion ofthe world has arrived!

1218
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:54,819
The champ is here!

1219
01:50:00,301 --> 01:50:02,030
Hey, man.

1220
01:50:02,103 --> 01:50:04,264
He's quiteyounger than you.
Howyou feeling about that?

1221
01:50:04,339 --> 01:50:07,001
He's quiteyounger than me?
Well, we quiteyounger than you.

1222
01:50:07,075 --> 01:50:11,535
Whatyou talkin' about? Thirty-two
years old. Best shape ofmy life.

1223
01:51:08,970 --> 01:51:11,598
Hey, stop!
All right, back up.

1224
01:51:18,413 --> 01:51:21,644
Did you see Muhammad Ali?

1225
01:55:41,843 --> 01:55:45,370
- Here's yourwater.
- Oh, thankyou, hon.

1226
01:55:45,446 --> 01:55:48,904
Bottled water.
Frozen steaks.

1227
01:55:48,983 --> 01:55:51,611
Brought all that stuffin
like Africa's ain't got no steaks.

1228
01:55:51,686 --> 01:55:55,588
- You could pick up parasites.
- Mobutu eats it.

1229
01:55:55,656 --> 01:55:58,250
Mobutu's takin' care of Mobutu.

1230
01:55:58,326 --> 01:56:00,920
He steals all the wealth
and sends it to Switzerland.

1231
01:56:02,296 --> 01:56:04,696
What that got to do
with any ofwhywe here?

1232
01:56:04,765 --> 01:56:10,169
We are here 'cause Don King
got Mobutu to put up $1 0 million.

1233
01:56:10,238 --> 01:56:14,038
Don King don't care about Africa.
He's worse than Herbert.

1234
01:56:14,742 --> 01:56:17,142
Here come Herbert.

1235
01:56:17,211 --> 01:56:19,907
And Don King fit right in too.

1236
01:56:19,981 --> 01:56:22,313
Now he's a dashiki-wearin' rip-off.

1237
01:56:22,383 --> 01:56:24,374
Don King delivered the first-ever...

1238
01:56:24,452 --> 01:56:26,716
black-promoted
championship fight in Africa.

1239
01:56:26,787 --> 01:56:30,723
Don King talks black,
lives white and thinks green.

1240
01:56:30,791 --> 01:56:33,123
And you're defending him
and Brother Herbert?

1241
01:56:33,194 --> 01:56:36,129
'Cause clean-cut Muslims in a parade
on the South Side ofChicago...

1242
01:56:36,197 --> 01:56:39,291
ain't gonna get this done!

1243
01:56:40,134 --> 01:56:43,035
I got to put honkies with connections
and bad-ass niggas to it.

1244
01:56:43,104 --> 01:56:45,038
And now they matched you up
against George Foreman.

1245
01:56:45,106 --> 01:56:48,075
Doyou think they give a damn
ifyou get killed?

1246
01:56:54,415 --> 01:56:56,440
So that's whatyou think?

1247
01:57:05,693 --> 01:57:08,719
I just wanna know why
my Muslim husband...

1248
01:57:08,796 --> 01:57:11,856
is allowing himself
to get strung up on a cross.

1249
01:57:11,933 --> 01:57:13,924
Just tell me why.

1250
01:57:22,276 --> 01:57:23,937
Maryum's sick.

1251
01:57:29,383 --> 01:57:32,284
Maybe I ought to go back
to Chicago and look after her?

1252
01:57:35,189 --> 01:57:36,656
Sure.

1253
01:57:43,464 --> 01:57:46,092
Well, then I guess
I'll be back before the fight.

1254
01:57:47,635 --> 01:57:50,001
Ifthat's all right, my husband.

1255
01:58:16,097 --> 01:58:18,088
This fight is no contest!

1256
01:58:18,165 --> 01:58:20,133
He is entirely too slow to fight me.

1257
01:58:20,201 --> 01:58:22,726
I say that George Foreman
is a mummy.

1258
01:58:22,803 --> 01:58:25,670
He's too slow.
You know I name all my fighters.

1259
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:27,901
I'm gonna call George Foreman
"The Mummy."

1260
01:58:27,975 --> 01:58:30,205
He fight like a mummy.

1261
01:58:34,048 --> 01:58:36,881
And when I see George throwin' punches,
this is what I hear:

1262
01:58:36,951 --> 01:58:39,351
Here come the left.

1263
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:41,684
Here come the right.

1264
01:58:41,756 --> 01:58:44,452
But the mummy can't hit
what the mummy can't see...

1265
01:58:44,525 --> 01:58:46,390
'cause I'm too fast for him.

1266
01:58:47,962 --> 01:58:50,795
I'm too fast.

1267
01:58:50,865 --> 01:58:54,824
I'm too fast. I'm too fast.
I move too good for him.

1268
01:58:54,902 --> 01:58:57,928
I'll hit George Foreman so many times,
he'll think he's surrounded.

1269
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:02,598
He gonna say, "Call the police!
It's five of'em in here!"

1270
01:59:04,245 --> 01:59:06,440
I'm bad, man. I'm bad!

1271
01:59:06,514 --> 01:59:10,382
Muhammad, I'm sorry.
I have to ask.

1272
01:59:11,052 --> 01:59:13,111
Areyou really
fast enough anymore...

1273
01:59:13,187 --> 01:59:15,417
to beat George Foreman?

1274
01:59:15,489 --> 01:59:20,290
Ifhe gets you against the ropes,
he can knockyou out with either hand.

1275
01:59:20,361 --> 01:59:24,957
Many people believeyou're not the man
you used to be ten years ago.

1276
01:59:28,035 --> 01:59:29,730
See, now, Howard...

1277
01:59:29,804 --> 01:59:33,137
I didn't even want to talk
about this, man.

1278
01:59:34,675 --> 01:59:38,441
Especially not out here
in front ofall these people.

1279
01:59:38,512 --> 01:59:41,174
But I talked toyourwife...

1280
01:59:41,248 --> 01:59:45,480
and she said you not the man
you used to be twoyears ago!

1281
02:00:07,975 --> 02:00:09,943
Champ.

1282
02:00:14,014 --> 02:00:16,949
- Champ, George had an accident.
- He-- He had what?

1283
02:00:17,017 --> 02:00:19,815
- What areyou talking about?
- He got cut right above his right eye.

1284
02:00:19,887 --> 02:00:22,412
His sparring partner's elbow
split it open.

1285
02:00:22,490 --> 02:00:25,015
- Can he fight?
- Not for six weeks.

1286
02:00:26,961 --> 02:00:29,054
This is not a humorous situation,
my champ.

1287
02:00:29,130 --> 02:00:32,759
This postponement could be long,
especially ifGeorge leaves.

1288
02:00:32,833 --> 02:00:35,063
You trying to
pull something here, Don?

1289
02:00:35,136 --> 02:00:37,798
IfGeorge leaves, he ain't comin' back.
George don't like it here.

1290
02:00:38,873 --> 02:00:42,502
How rightyou are, my suspicious
and short ltalian brother.

1291
02:00:42,576 --> 02:00:45,306
Look here, man,
my fiduciary responsibility...

1292
02:00:45,379 --> 02:00:47,813
to this first all-black promotion...

1293
02:00:47,882 --> 02:00:51,409
is analogous to a garden in the African
sun-- it must grow, it must bloom.

1294
02:00:51,485 --> 02:00:55,888
Cannot flower in the gloom and shade
ofpostponement to the Astrodome...

1295
02:00:55,956 --> 02:00:58,720
or any dome out ofZaire where it be
deprivileged oflight and bled ofwater.

1296
02:00:58,793 --> 02:01:02,456
'Cause what gonna be bleedin' out of
there is money-- a hemorrhage ofcash.

1297
02:01:02,530 --> 02:01:04,464
I'm talkin' about blood on the floor.

1298
02:01:04,532 --> 02:01:08,024
Double hotel costs, airplane,
travel costs, food and beverage.

1299
02:01:08,102 --> 02:01:12,004
- So what doyou want us to do?
- Muhammad Ali. The people's champion.

1300
02:01:12,072 --> 02:01:13,334
My black brother.

1301
02:01:13,407 --> 02:01:16,205
I need you.
I need your strength.

1302
02:01:16,277 --> 02:01:19,542
I need you to find a way
to get George to stay.

1303
02:01:19,613 --> 02:01:22,013
Be Moses in reverse.

1304
02:01:22,082 --> 02:01:26,178
Do not let my people go.
Keep them the fuck right here in Egypt.

1305
02:01:26,253 --> 02:01:28,517
- Ifyou'll pardon my Swahili.
- Lingala.

1306
02:01:28,589 --> 02:01:30,887
- Saywhat?
- They speak Lingala.

1307
02:01:31,959 --> 02:01:35,360
Ali wants his title,
and he wants it in Zaire.

1308
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:42,030
Okay, all right, okay.
Let's take it back.

1309
02:01:42,102 --> 02:01:45,299
George go, George go.
Hell, I can getyouJoe Frazier.

1310
02:01:45,372 --> 02:01:48,466
Ali-Frazier 3.
That's the fight everybodywant to see.

1311
02:01:48,542 --> 02:01:52,478
- We don't want Frazier, we want George.
- Hell, I don't control George Foreman.

1312
02:02:35,489 --> 02:02:39,653
There's been an accidental injury
to George Foreman in training.

1313
02:02:39,727 --> 02:02:41,524
The truth is...

1314
02:02:41,595 --> 02:02:43,324
George knocked hisselfout.

1315
02:02:44,398 --> 02:02:45,831
That's right.

1316
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:48,960
He did three rounds, realized
he was gonna lose to Muhammad Ali...

1317
02:02:49,036 --> 02:02:50,469
and knocked hisselfout.

1318
02:02:51,472 --> 02:02:54,236
I predict that when the fight is set,
he might not show.

1319
02:02:54,308 --> 02:02:55,434
Oh, you bad.

1320
02:02:55,509 --> 02:02:58,501
- That's right, I'm a bad man.
- Ain't no doubt about that.

1321
02:02:58,579 --> 02:03:00,877
Yeah, butyou tell George
the same thing.

1322
02:03:00,948 --> 02:03:02,882
I heard you.
I been watching you.

1323
02:03:02,950 --> 02:03:06,943
I know he's your man, I knowyou got
him picked, but the man is in trouble.

1324
02:03:07,021 --> 02:03:10,081
The whole world was gonna know,
but now he ain't gonna show.

1325
02:03:10,858 --> 02:03:14,021
In order to ensure that George is ready,
we are thinking ofpostponing...

1326
02:03:14,094 --> 02:03:17,063
from September 24 to October 30.

1327
02:03:17,131 --> 02:03:19,099
What about the concert?

1328
02:03:19,166 --> 02:03:23,626
The concert will go on as planned.
Those dates are September 20, 21 --

1329
02:03:23,704 --> 02:03:28,004
I want all the helicopters guarded,
all the private planes, private boats.

1330
02:03:28,075 --> 02:03:30,009
I'm serious.
I want the airports--

1331
02:03:30,077 --> 02:03:32,272
I want President Mobutu
and all his paratroopers--

1332
02:03:32,346 --> 02:03:35,110
All you Zaireans,
y'all be on guard too.

1333
02:03:35,182 --> 02:03:38,811
Any strange boats creeping away,
they might be taking him out.

1334
02:03:38,886 --> 02:03:40,285
Bus stations.

1335
02:03:40,354 --> 02:03:41,844
And bus stations!

1336
02:03:41,922 --> 02:03:43,856
Right.
Watch the bus stations.

1337
02:03:43,924 --> 02:03:47,382
The elephant caravans-- They might be
trying to take him out on an elephant.

1338
02:03:47,461 --> 02:03:49,861
- What'd you say?
- Hell, I ain't talking toyou.

1339
02:03:49,930 --> 02:03:51,522
Hey. Hey, man.

1340
02:03:52,633 --> 02:03:54,794
Don'tyou never talk
to Angelo like that.

1341
02:03:54,868 --> 02:03:58,531
Don'tyou never talk to Angie
like that again.

1342
02:03:58,605 --> 02:04:00,436
Something wrong with you, man?

1343
02:04:02,042 --> 02:04:05,478
Thinkyou callin' some shots here?
You ain't callin' nothin'.

1344
02:04:07,448 --> 02:04:09,848
They all know.

1345
02:04:09,917 --> 02:04:12,886
All them ladies out there,
they know I'm ready.

1346
02:04:12,953 --> 02:04:16,150
I see fear in the eyes
ofhis followers.

1347
02:04:16,223 --> 02:04:19,852
This was supposed to be the fight
that Muhammad Ali was ended.

1348
02:04:19,927 --> 02:04:24,660
Supposed to be Muhammad was gonna fall.
Supposed to be my destruction.

1349
02:04:24,732 --> 02:04:27,223
Well, they miscalculated.
They misjudged.

1350
02:04:27,301 --> 02:04:28,962
They got it wrong.

1351
02:04:51,992 --> 02:04:53,721
Hold on a second.

1352
02:04:54,995 --> 02:04:56,087
What's your name?

1353
02:04:57,598 --> 02:04:58,758
Veronica Porche.

1354
02:04:58,832 --> 02:05:00,766
Porche. Like the sports car.

1355
02:05:00,834 --> 02:05:03,769
- Yes.

1356
02:05:03,837 --> 02:05:05,327
Hey, you with Don?

1357
02:05:06,407 --> 02:05:10,207
Don brought me here,
but I'm not with anybody, no.

1358
02:05:10,277 --> 02:05:12,677
- Whereyou come from?
- LA.

1359
02:05:12,746 --> 02:05:15,078
- LA?
- But my people are from Louisiana.

1360
02:05:15,149 --> 02:05:16,514
Louisiana.

1361
02:05:16,583 --> 02:05:18,551
What, you Creole?

1362
02:05:18,619 --> 02:05:23,682
We're Creole,
so I'm African, French and Spanish.

1363
02:05:23,757 --> 02:05:25,782
My mother's grandfatherwasJewish.

1364
02:05:26,493 --> 02:05:29,792
Well, they mixed all that stuffup
in there real nice.

1365
02:05:29,863 --> 02:05:32,730
I'm the onlywitch doctor here.
Bundini Brown.

1366
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:35,030
Bundini Brown
is an authentic witch doctor.

1367
02:05:35,102 --> 02:05:38,037
- You tell 'em.
- The only one in the United States.

1368
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:43,007
I'm real glad
you said whatyou did.

1369
02:05:43,077 --> 02:05:46,342
You made sure the fight stays here.

1370
02:05:49,516 --> 02:05:52,610
You know all them reporters
and writers in there...

1371
02:05:53,921 --> 02:05:56,355
they say George
is gonna kill me.

1372
02:05:57,458 --> 02:05:58,823
Whatyou think?

1373
02:06:02,896 --> 02:06:04,887

1374
02:06:04,965 --> 02:06:07,058
- We want thankyou.

1375
02:06:07,134 --> 02:06:08,999

1376

Y'all gonna thank me?

1377
02:06:15,409 --> 02:06:17,900
They thanking me for something.

1378
02:06:17,978 --> 02:06:22,244
Hey, you ever been down to Hong Kong?
Thailand? Taiwan?

1379
02:06:22,316 --> 02:06:25,251
- No.
- No? I can't go there.

1380
02:06:25,886 --> 02:06:29,344
- Hi, Ruthie. How areyou?
- Hi, champ.

1381
02:06:32,025 --> 02:06:33,993
What's going on?
I'm great. Howyou feeling?

1382
02:06:34,061 --> 02:06:36,427
When I go to sleep,
this closes up.

1383
02:06:37,498 --> 02:06:40,934
That's what happens. When I go
to sleep, all this rests together.

1384
02:06:41,001 --> 02:06:43,299
During the day, I got to think.

1385
02:06:43,370 --> 02:06:46,771
Get me out ofthis country.
All the women so pretty.

1386
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:52,107
All of'em, they got hair come all
the way down to the back oftheir knees.

1387
02:06:52,179 --> 02:06:55,774
All of'em-- All of'em
about Veronica's complexion.

1388
02:06:55,849 --> 02:06:58,215
Every single one of'em.
Bad, man.

1389
02:06:59,887 --> 02:07:02,151
But ain't nothing like the sisters.

1390
02:07:03,323 --> 02:07:06,121
Ain't nothing like the sisters.

1391
02:07:09,963 --> 02:07:13,228
Come on. Why don't we go
take a ride or something?

1392
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:14,858
Wanna come with me?

1393
02:07:24,711 --> 02:07:28,238
Ruth, tell us the truth.

1394
02:07:28,982 --> 02:07:30,643
More cushion for the pushin'.

1395
02:07:33,921 --> 02:07:35,149

1396
02:07:36,456 --> 02:07:38,481
So whyyou so glad

1397
02:07:42,229 --> 02:07:45,665
Making the fight stay here
in Africa--

1398
02:07:47,301 --> 02:07:50,964

Well, that's onejob.

1400

Islamic faith helpyou do that?

1402
02:08:12,926 --> 02:08:16,657
Listen, girl, as a Muslim
I am failed in the eyes ofGod.

1403
02:08:16,730 --> 02:08:20,996
I should've discovered lslam at 50,
'cause I'm weak on women.

1404
02:08:22,269 --> 02:08:24,430
First they take my eyes.

1405
02:08:24,504 --> 02:08:26,972

02:08:29,276 --> 02:08:32,211
and the most terriblest husband
at the same time.

02:08:34,815 --> 02:08:36,510
Look atyou.

1409
02:08:36,583 --> 02:08:38,949
Green eyes.

1410
02:08:39,019 --> 02:08:40,816
Cocoa skin.

1411
02:08:41,922 --> 02:08:44,186
Okay, rest ofme, let's go.

1412
02:08:52,165 --> 02:08:53,257
Rumble, Ali.

1413
02:09:37,044 --> 02:09:39,376
- Mrs. Ali.
- Hello, Muhammad, Mr. Cosell.

1414
02:09:39,446 --> 02:09:42,279
- Hey, when you get in?

1415
02:09:42,349 --> 02:09:45,785
And I learned we now have this suite

1416
02:09:47,287 --> 02:09:49,653

02:09:49,723 --> 02:09:51,156

1421
02:10:06,440 --> 02:10:10,035
Do I have to read about it? Do people
have to call me on the phone to tell me?

1422
02:10:10,110 --> 02:10:12,044
I didn't mean for that
to come out.

1423
02:10:12,112 --> 02:10:15,878
And I live with the casual ones.
I live with 'em.

1424
02:10:15,949 --> 02:10:18,816
So why doyou
disrespect me like this?

1434
02:15:11,244 --> 02:15:12,506
There it is.

1435
02:15:26,493 --> 02:15:28,859
Hey, Zack, where's George?

1436
02:15:28,928 --> 02:15:30,395
