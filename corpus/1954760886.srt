1
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:07,592
Good morning, Mr Fredricksen.
You're ready to go?

2
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:09,969
I'll meet you at the van. Just a minute.

3
00:00:10,345 --> 00:00:14,265
I wanna say
one last goodbye to the old place.

4
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:17,102
Sure. Take all the time you need, sir.

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,314
Typical!

6
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:23,566
He's probably going to the bathroom
for the 80th time.

7
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:27,612
You'd think
he'd take better care of his house.

8
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:45,296
So long, boys!

9
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:14,993
I'm standing adjacent to the location
where yesterday,

10
00:01:15,076 --> 00:01:17,829
onlookers witnessed a liftoff
by what some are calling,

11
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,164
"A flying house."

12
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,540
Tell us what you saw.

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,880
Construction workers in the area say
the flying house belongs to this man,

14
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:30,341
recently convicted public menace,
Carl Fredricksen.

15
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,802
City officials say
the search will continue,

16
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:34,304
but after yesterday's storm,

17
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:35,847
<i>there may be no clues as to where</i>

18
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,892
<i>Carl Fredricksen</i>
<i>and his house have gone.</i>

19
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:42,020
<i>It appears as if elderly public menace</i>
<i>Carl Fredricksen</i>

20
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,980
<i>has indeed escaped.</i>

21
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:46,858
Attaboy, Carl!

22
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:55,867
Okay. Here we go.

23
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:57,660
Are you ready?

24
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:59,037
Yeah. Okay.

25
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,625
Good morning, Mrs Peterson.

26
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:05,543
You ready to go...

27
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:45,917
Oh, no!

28
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,587
So long, suckers!

29
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:17,782
Afternoon, boys!

30
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,459
Mr Fredricksen?

31
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:33,047
That was so cool!
Let's do that again, Mr Fredricksen.

32
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:35,341
But next time, I wanna steer.

33
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:39,095
That was the craziest thing
I've ever seen!

34
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,474
Hi, there.
