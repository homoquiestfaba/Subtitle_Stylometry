1
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Get Charlie.

2
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,900
Doctor Holloway!

3
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,300
Charlie!

4
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,300
What?!
- Come quick!

5
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,500
Did you date it?
- 35.000 years, maybe older.

6
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,000
You got to be kidding me.

7
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,100
It's the same configuration.

8
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,100
Only it's got to predate the
others, by a millennium.

9
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,600
I think they want us
to come and find them.

10
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,300
<i>What happened to that man?
- He died.</i>

11
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:52,600
<i>Why aren't you helping him?</i>

12
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:57,000
<i>They don't want my help.
Their God is different than ours.</i>

13
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,000
<i>Why did he die?</i>

14
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:05,000
<i>Sooner or later everyone does.
- Like mommy?</i>

15
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,600
<i>Like mommy.</i>

16
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,030
<i>Where do they go?</i>

17
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:14,400
<i>Everyone has their own word.</i>

18
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:18,800
<i>Heaven, Paradise...</i>

19
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:21,600
<i>Whatever it's called,
it's someplace beautiful.</i>

20
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:25,200
<i>How do you know it's beautiful?</i>

21
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:29,201
<i>Cos that's what I choose to
believe. What do you believe darling?</i>

22
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,700
<i>Good morning, David.</i>

23
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,100
<i>Transmitting message.</i>

24
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,900
<i>No response.</i>

25
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Whilst this manner of articulation
is attested indeed in the

26
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:28,700
Indo-European descendants as
a purely paralinguistic form,

27
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:34,200
it is phonemic in the ancestral form
dating back five millennium or more.

28
00:07:34,201 --> 00:07:36,700
Now let's attempt Schleicher's Fable.

29
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:38,900
Repeat after me:

30
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,600
Perfect.

31
00:07:52,601 --> 00:07:56,800
<i>Mr. Lawrence? - Yes?
- Flimsy, sir. - Thank you.</i>

32
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,500
<i>You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.</i>

33
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:10,600
<i>Michael George Hartley,
you're a philosopher.</i>

34
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:13,200
<i>And you're balmy!</i>

35
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,500
<i>Ow! It damn well hurts.
- Certainly, it hurts!</i>

36
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,600
<i>Well, what's the trick then?</i>

37
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:26,600
<i>The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.</i>

38
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:33,600
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

39
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:06,500
<i>Attention! Destination threshold.</i>

40
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,000
<i>Attention! Destination threshold.</i>

41
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,300
Robe.

42
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
How long?

43
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,700
2 years, 4 months, 18 days,
36 hours, 15 minutes...

44
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:32,600
Any casualties?
- Casualties, ma'am?

45
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:37,000
Has anyone died?
- No ma'am, everyone's fine.

46
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,700
Well, then wake them up.

47
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,400
Try to relax Dr. Shaw.

48
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:57,200
My name is David.

49
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:59,900
Your mind and body are
in the state of shock,

50
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:04,400
as a result of stasis.
All that is perfectly normal.

51
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:08,700
Ellie, we're here baby.

52
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,400
<i>Drink plenty of water,
drink plenty of fluids.</i>

53
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:21,000
<i>Hydration aids muscle mass.</i>

54
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,400
What the hell is that?

55
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,000
It's Christmas, need a holiday
to show time is still moving.

56
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:46,000
Mission briefing is about to start captain.

57
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:48,200
You might want to make your way down.

58
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:50,600
I haven't had breakfast yet.

59
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:56,300
Is this seat taken? I'm Millburn,
biology, nice to meet you.

60
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,700
No offence, but, I've
been asleep two years.

61
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:08,600
I isn’t here to be your friend.

62
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:12,900
I'm here to make money, you got that?

63
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,700
OK.

64
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:19,800
I bet a hundred credits
it's a terraforming survey.

65
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:22,700
If it's a survey, they would just tell us.
- This is a corporate run,

66
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:27,000
they're not telling us shit, come on.
- A hundred, alright, you're on.

67
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,800
You look nervous, Ellie.
- Trying to keep my feet on the ground.

68
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:38,400
I know you are.
- Good morning.

69
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:41,800
For those of you I hired personally,

70
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:44,200
it's nice to see you again.

71
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:49,000
For the rest of you, I am Meredith Vickers
and it's my job to make sure you do yours.

72
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,800
OK then, on with the show.

73
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,500
<i>Weyland Corporation,
building better worlds.</i>

74
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,300
Hello friends.

75
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,100
My name is Peter Weyland.

76
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,100
I am your employer.

77
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:16,000
I am recording this 22, June, 2091.

78
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:20,500
If you're watching it, you
have reached your destination.

79
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:23,300
And I am long dead.

80
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,900
May I rest in peace.

81
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:29,700
There's a man sitting with
you today, his name is David.

82
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:32,800
He is the closest thing
to a son I will ever have.

83
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:39,100
Unfortunately he is not human, he will
never grow old, and he will never die.

84
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,600
Yet he is unable to appreciate
these remarkable gifts,

85
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:48,300
for that would require the one
thing that David will never have.

86
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:50,500
A soul.

87
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:54,900
I have spent my entire lifetime
contemplating these questions.

88
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:58,800
Where do we come from?
What is our purpose?

89
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:00,900
What happens when you die?

90
00:14:00,901 --> 00:14:03,000
And I have finally found two
people who have convinced me

91
00:14:03,001 --> 00:14:05,100
they are on the verge of answering them.

92
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,600
Doctors Holloway and Shaw,
if you would please stand.

93
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,900
As far as you're concerned
they are both in charge.

94
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:18,600
The Titan, Prometheus, wanted to give
mankind equal footing with the gods,

95
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:22,700
for that he was cast from Olympus.

96
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,400
Well, my friends, the time has
finally come for his return.

97
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,600
Doctors, please.

98
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,400
Floor is yours.

99
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,700
Ok...

100
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,100
Never had to follow a ghost before.

101
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:53,000
OK, let me show why you guys are here.

102
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,200
These are images of archaeological
digs, from all over the Earth.

103
00:15:05,201 --> 00:15:09,700
That's Egyptian, Mayan,
Sumerian, Babylonian,

104
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:12,800
that's Hawaiian there at
the end, and Mesopotamian.

105
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:15,100
This one here is our
most recent discovery.

106
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:20,200
It's a 35.000 year old cave painting
from the Isle of Skye in Scotland.

107
00:15:20,201 --> 00:15:24,600
These are ancient civilizations,
that were separated by centuries,

108
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:29,000
they shared no contact
with one another, and yet...

109
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,100
The same pictogram showing
men worshiping giant beings

110
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:40,000
pointing to the stars was
discovered at every last one of them.

111
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,700
The only galactic system that matched,

112
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:47,300
was so far from earth that
there's no way that these primitive

113
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:50,900
ancient civilizations could
have possibly known about.

114
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:54,200
But it just so happens,

115
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:56,900
that that system,

116
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:59,200
has a sun.

117
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:01,600
A lot like ours.

118
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:06,600
And based on our long range
scans, there seems to be a planet.

119
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Just one planet with a moon
capable of sustaining life.

120
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,000
And we arrived there this morning.

121
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,900
So, you say we're here because of a map,
you two kids found in a cave, is that right?

122
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,000
No.
- Yes.

123
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,900
No, not a map, an invitation.
- From whom?

124
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,600
We called them engineers.
- Engineers?

125
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:41,700
Do you mind telling us
what they engineered?

126
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,600
They engineered us.

127
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,800
Bullshit.

128
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,500
Do you have anything to back that up?

129
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:59,900
I mean, look if you're willing to
discount 3 centuries of Darwinism that's...

130
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,500
But how do you know?
- I don't.

131
00:17:05,501 --> 00:17:09,300
But it's what I choose to believe.

132
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,600
Doctors?

133
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:42,600
Miss Vickers would like to have a
quick word, before the adventure begins.

134
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,100
Nice place.
- It's actually a separate module,

135
00:17:52,101 --> 00:17:55,000
with its own self-contained life support.

136
00:17:55,001 --> 00:18:00,800
Air, food, anything miss Vickers would
need to survive hostile environment.

137
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:07,400
OK, so she lives on a life boat.
- Yes, I do, I like to minimize risk.

138
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:11,600
David, why don't you
make the doctors a drink?

139
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:14,800
I'll take a vodka, up.

140
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:18,800
Charlie look, it's a Pauling med-pod.

141
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,600
They only made a dozen of these.
- Miss Shaw!

142
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,600
<i>Please verbally state the
nature of your injury.</i>

143
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:29,900
Please don't touch that. It's a
very expensive piece of machinery.

144
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:33,700
It does bypass surgeries,
what do you need it for?

145
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,900
I think there might be some
confusion about our relationship.

146
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:40,500
Weyland found you impressive
enough to fund this mission,

147
00:18:40,501 --> 00:18:43,750
but I'm fairly certain your
"engineers" are nothing but scribbling

148
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:47,000
of savages living in dirty little caves.

149
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:51,100
But let's say I'm wrong, and you
do find these beings down there.

150
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:53,700
You won't engage them.

151
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:59,000
You won't talk to them, you will
do nothing but report it back to me.

152
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,200
Miss Vickers, is there an agenda
that you're not telling us about?

153
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:09,700
My company paid a trillion dollars to
find this place and to bring you here.

154
00:19:09,701 --> 00:19:12,800
Had you raised the money
yourself Mr. Holloway,

155
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:15,900
we'd happily be pursuing your, agenda.

156
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
But you didn't.

157
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:21,800
And that makes you an employee.

158
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,000
If we can't make contact, why
did you even bring us here?

159
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:30,300
Weyland was a superstitious man.

160
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,300
He wanted a true believer on board.

161
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,000
Cheers.

162
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,200
So no response?
- I am sorry, no.

163
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:46,600
Maybe they didn't understand it.

164
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:49,900
How are your lessons going, David?

165
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:55,300
I spent two years deconstructing dozens
of ancient languages, to their roots.

166
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:57,600
I'm confident I can
communicate with them,

167
00:19:57,601 --> 00:20:01,100
provided your thesis is correct.

168
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:03,200
Provided it's correct, that's good.

169
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:07,100
That's why they call
it a thesis, doctor.

170
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,300
What are you smiling about?
- Alright, Mr. Ravel, Mr. Chance,

171
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:15,300
let's take her down.
- Roger that. - Yes captain.

172
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,300
How are we doing?
- Great.

173
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Alright boss.
- All personnel, this is the captain.

174
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:27,600
Brace for entry.
- Yes captain.

175
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,000
That means you too Vickers.

176
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What is the atmosphere?

177
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:46,200
Atmosphere is 71% Nitrogen,
21% Oxygen, traces of unknown gas.

178
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:49,300
Whoa, now that's weather.
- Just like home.

179
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:51,900
Only if you're breathing
through an exhaust pipe.

180
00:20:51,901 --> 00:20:57,400
CO2 is over 3%. Two minutes
without a suite, you're dead.

181
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,300
Peak, port side, 52.000. Makes
Everest look like a baby brother.

182
00:21:05,301 --> 00:21:07,800
Alright, take us round.

183
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:11,000
We will use that as our point of entry.

184
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,000
Terrain data rising up. We've got a
couple of hard spots. Could be metal.

185
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,500
No radio, no heat source.
- Nobody's home.

186
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:47,300
There's nothing in the
desert. No man needs nothing.

187
00:21:47,301 --> 00:21:52,100
What was that?
- Just something from a film I like.

188
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,100
Let's go through that gateway.
Reduce air speed by 100 knots.

189
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,200
Going through, nice and slow.

190
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,700
Keep her steady boys.
- There.

191
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,800
What are you doing?

192
00:22:17,801 --> 00:22:20,700
Doctor Holloway why
don't you take a seat?!

193
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Right there. God does not
build in straight lines.

194
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:28,900
Starboard side, this valley! Captain,
do you think you can put us down there?

195
00:22:28,901 --> 00:22:34,900
I wouldn't be any good if I couldn't do
that, Mr. Ravel, starboard 90 degrees.

196
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,000
One mile, port bow.
- One mile, port bow.

197
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:45,600
Engage landing sequence.
Switch to manual.

198
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:50,500
Easy does it. Yeah baby, yeah.

199
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,800
Putting her down in 5, 4...

200
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,900
2, easy does it.

201
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,000
Captain, would you please tell
the survey team to suit up?

202
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,400
And meet us in the air lock.
- There's only 6 hours left of daylight.

203
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:46,500
Why don't you leave it 'till the morning?
- No, no, it's Christmas captain,

204
00:23:46,501 --> 00:23:48,800
and I want to open my presents.

205
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:53,500
You, boy, you're coming with us.
- I'd be delighted.

206
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,500
Hey Jackson, what's that for?

207
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,000
Expedition security. My job is to
make sure everybody's nice and safe.

208
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,000
This is a scientific
expedition, no weapons.

209
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:19,500
Alright then. Good luck with that.

210
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,900
David, why are wearing a suite?

211
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:28,800
I beg your pardon?
- You don't breathe, remember?

212
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,900
So, why wear a suit?

213
00:24:30,901 --> 00:24:34,500
I was designed like this
because you people are

214
00:24:34,501 --> 00:24:38,100
more comfortable interacting
with your own kind.

215
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,800
If I didn't wear a suite,
it would defeat the purpose.

216
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:47,700
Making you guys pretty close?
- Not to close I hope.

217
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,000
This is just one small step for mankind.

218
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:35,600
Seriously?

219
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,200
Come on! You ready to
do this?! I know you are.

220
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,999
Fifield, I want a
spectrograph on that structure,

221
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,400
I want to know if it's natural or
somebody put it there, alright?

222
00:25:57,401 --> 00:26:03,200
I can't tell you if it's natural or not,
but what I can tell you is, it's hollow.

223
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:30,600
Prometheus, are you seeing this?

224
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:33,900
Affirmative, we see you.

225
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,000
Are you ready?
- Yeah. - Let's do it.

226
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,500
After you.
- After you.

227
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,700
Careful.
- Prometheus, we're going in.

228
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:25,701
Copy that.

229
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,500
Pause back here, some
kind of a corridor.

230
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:07,600
Mr. Fifield, let's get a grid of the
structure, I want the whole interior.

231
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:10,000
If there's anything in
here worth looking at,

232
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:14,800
these pups will find them.
- Pups? - Yeah, my pups.

233
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,800
Prometheus, we are now mapping.

234
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,700
Copy that.

235
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,800
I'll be damned.

236
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,600
Fifield, you got a reading?
- Yeah.

237
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:10,800
Pups are saying, this way.

238
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,800
Look at this.

239
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,000
Oh Charlie...

240
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,200
Jesus, sunlight's heating the water.

241
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:50,100
Check out the humidity.
- Yeah, look at the CO2 levels.

242
00:29:50,101 --> 00:29:55,000
Outside it's completely toxic,
and in here there's nothing.

243
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,600
It's breathable.

244
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
What are you doing?
Charlie, don't be an idiot.

245
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:06,100
Don't be a sceptic. There's something
generating an atmosphere, David?

246
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:09,300
Dr. Holloway is correct.
- Cleaner than ours, actually.

247
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:12,300
They were terraforming here.
- Please, don't do...

248
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:15,000
Ellie, I'm not wearing this thing anymore.

249
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:19,600
<i>Wish me luck babe. - Do you copy,
do not remove your head gear.</i>

250
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,100
You crazy bastard.

251
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,749
Prometheus connect our suit cameras if you
want to continue watching this freak show,

252
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,100
we are taking our helmets off.

253
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:52,000
<i>Copy that, switching feeds.</i>

254
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,800
Well come on, pay up.

255
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:58,700
Pay what?
- What do you mean "pay what"?

256
00:30:58,701 --> 00:31:01,100
Something's manufacturing
breathable air down there.

257
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:05,100
That means it's terraforming. - No, no,
the bet was why we came here.

258
00:31:05,101 --> 00:31:08,500
If you said that that old man wanted
to talk to Martians, then I'd pay

259
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:11,000
Oh come on, a hundred
credits, put it towards

260
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:13,500
a lap dance of miss
Vickers, how about that?

261
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,300
It's minus 12 in here.

262
00:31:17,301 --> 00:31:21,600
So why is this water not frozen?

263
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:24,300
Maybe it's Martian piss.

264
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:30,500
That's your, scientific
theory? Is it, Mr. Biology?

265
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,500
Well, whatever it is it sure is clean.

266
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,300
Impressive.

267
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,700
What was that?
- David?

268
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:26,300
David?!

269
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,600
David?!

270
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Ellie!

271
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,500
What the hell was that? - Aren't
you glad we didn't bring any weapons?

272
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:53,200
Whose idea was that?!
- Keep up!

273
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,000
Where did he go?

274
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,500
There it is.

275
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:25,200
Oh my God, Charlie we found them.
- What do you mean "them"?

276
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,300
It is them Ellie.

277
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:34,500
Looks like a door, and
he's been decapitated by it.

278
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,700
Son of a bitch.

279
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:41,600
They were right.

280
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,600
Did you want them to be wrong?

281
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,600
David, please tell me you can read that.

282
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:56,100
Perhaps.

283
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,600
I'm out of here.

284
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:04,000
Fifield, where are you going?

285
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:07,000
What?

286
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:12,600
Look, I'm just a geologist,
I like rocks, I love rocks.

287
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:15,400
It's clear you two don't
give a shit about rocks,

288
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:18,900
but what you do seem to care
about is gigantic dead bodies

289
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:24,800
I don't really have anything to
contribute in the gigantic dead body arena!

290
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:29,900
I'm going to go back to the
ship, if you don't mind.

291
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,300
Anyone want to join me? You staying?

292
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,900
No, ship's good.
- Yeah, ship very good.

293
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:47,100
Congratulations on meeting your maker.
- Thank you.

294
00:34:47,101 --> 00:34:50,900
Pull yourself together man.

295
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,100
I thought you were the crazy one.

296
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,900
Do you have the carbon reader?

297
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,400
Thank you.

298
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,800
How long has it been dead?

299
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,300
Two thousand years, give or take.

300
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,000
What are you doing David?

301
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:29,800
I'm attempting to open the door.

302
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:32,600
Wait, we don't know
what's on the other side.

303
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,900
Ups, sorry.

304
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,100
Look Ford, it's the head.

305
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,900
An amazing state of preservation.

306
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:58,600
We'll take it in.

307
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,300
Remarkably human.

308
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Beautiful painting.

309
00:36:23,001 --> 00:36:26,300
It's a mural.

310
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,700
Stop, stop, don't touch it.
- Sorry.

311
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,000
Please, don't touch anything.

312
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,301
It's sweating.

313
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,500
Organic.

314
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,500
Oh no, Charlie the murals are changing.

315
00:37:35,501 --> 00:37:38,000
I think we've averted the
atmosphere in the room.

316
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:40,900
<i>Charlie, do you copy?</i>

317
00:37:40,901 --> 00:37:45,900
Overhead, Ford quick,
help me bag the head.

318
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,500
<i>Boss?
- What you got?</i>

319
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:01,900
We got an incoming
storm front, silica and

320
00:38:01,901 --> 00:38:06,300
<i>lots of static, this is not good.
- I see it.</i>

321
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,800
<i>Ground crew this is Janet.</i>

322
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:13,300
<i>Need you to hustle back right now.</i>

323
00:38:13,301 --> 00:38:15,499
<i>Ground crew, do
you copy? I got 200 km</i>

324
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,700
<i>winds of airborne silica and
enough static to fry your suit.</i>

325
00:38:19,701 --> 00:38:23,100
Copy that sir, but we
need more time here.

326
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:26,000
I'll be closing the
outer doors in 15 minutes.

327
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:29,100
<i>I sincerely hope you can make it.</i>

328
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,600
Charlie, David, we must leave now!

329
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,500
This is just another tomb.

330
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,400
David?

331
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,700
Let's go!

332
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,100
David, we are leaving!

333
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,900
Come on! Damn it,
they've already taken off.

334
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:13,300
Come on, let's go.

335
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:16,800
<i>Prometheus to ground crew,
you're running out of time.</i>

336
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:19,300
Come on.

337
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,400
Drive faster!

338
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,300
Charlie, the head!

339
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:04,200
Ellie stop! What are you doing?!

340
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Shit

341
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:17,300
Ellie hold on!

342
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,300
<i>Goddamn it.
- Close it!</i>

343
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,800
Got it.

344
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
<i>Decontamination at level 3.</i>

345
00:41:35,401 --> 00:41:37,500
What was that Ellie?

346
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:39,650
You could have compromised
the entire mission,

347
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:41,800
not to mention almost killing yourself!

348
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:46,500
Are you alright?
- Yes, thank you David.

349
00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:48,600
My pleasure.

350
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:52,800
Alright doctors, it's real good to have
you back, but where is Millburn and Fifield?

351
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:56,000
<i>Aren't they back yet?</i>

352
00:41:56,001 --> 00:41:58,500
Kick them up for me.

353
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,900
We've been here before Fifield.
- I know, it all looks the same to me.

354
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:08,600
<i>Boys this is the captain, listen up.</i>

355
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:12,200
Between the static
electricity and the wind speed,

356
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:15,100
there isn’t no safe way to come get you.

357
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:19,500
<i>Temperature is dropping rapidly, so
get your helmets on and stay warm.</i>

358
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:22,700
Till the storm passes.

359
00:42:22,701 --> 00:42:27,200
Captain, can you get a message to the
scientist and that zealot girlfriend of his?

360
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:30,800
<i>Know what they’re paying me by?
- No. I think we got it.</i>

361
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:34,100
<i>Tell them I said... themselves.</i>

362
00:42:34,101 --> 00:42:36,400
<i>Copy?
- Copy that.</i>

363
00:42:36,401 --> 00:42:41,100
Alright boys, keep your heads down
and we'll come get you in the morning.

364
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:04,300
Sample is sterile, no contagion present.
- David.

365
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,400
So are they all dead?

366
00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:13,900
What? Who?
- Your engineers.

367
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:19,000
Are they all dead or aren't they?
- I don't know, we just got here.

368
00:43:19,001 --> 00:43:21,201
Scan.

369
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,500
Do you even care if they're all dead?
- Weyland cared.

370
00:43:26,501 --> 00:43:30,300
Dr. Shaw, have a look at this.

371
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:38,400
That's not an exoskeleton.
- No. - I think it's a helmet.

372
00:43:38,401 --> 00:43:43,000
Let's see if we can lift it up.
- Should be able to pry this open.

373
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:47,100
It's too heavy for us, David.

374
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,300
Careful.
- Like so.

375
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:14,400
What is that on its head?
- It looks like neo cells.

376
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:18,000
In a state of...
- Change. - Yes.

377
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:20,001
Changing into what?

378
00:44:20,002 --> 00:44:22,500
Can you run a stim line
into Locus Coeruleus?

379
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:26,600
I think we can trick the nervous
system into thinking it's still alive.

380
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,900
30 amps.
- OK. - No more.

381
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,500
Let me make an incision.
- OK.

382
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,600
Go up, 40.

383
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,500
OK, 40 up.

384
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:49,400
Did you see that?

385
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,500
See? Go up another 10.

386
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:55,900
OK, up 10.

387
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,500
Too much, go down 10.
- OK, down 10.

388
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:05,500
Down another 20.
- I'm trying. - Ford, down.

389
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,900
Ford, stop it!

390
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:14,000
David, contain it now!
- Contain it, turn it off, now!

391
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,100
Mortal after all.

392
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,100
Ford take a sample.

393
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:49,200
Let's have a look.

394
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,100
No sir, I will take care of it.

395
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:59,500
Yes sir I understand, I’m sorry.

396
00:45:59,501 --> 00:46:03,700
Unfortunately, slightly premature.

397
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,100
Of course sir.

398
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Miss Vickers?

399
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,400
What did he say David? - I don't
think he'd want me to tell you.

400
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,200
What did he say?
- I'm sorry, that's confidential.

401
00:46:58,201 --> 00:47:04,900
So help me God, I will find the cord
that makes you run and I will cut it.

402
00:47:04,901 --> 00:47:08,200
What did he say?

403
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:14,500
He said: "Try harder".

404
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,700
Cup of tea, ma'am?

405
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:39,500
Genetic view. - OK.
- Let's have a look at its DNA.

406
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,800
Isolate the strand.

407
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,200
Compare it to the gene sample.

408
00:47:56,201 --> 00:48:00,500
<i>Overlay.
- Processing.</i>

409
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,600
<i>Processing.</i>

410
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,500
<i>DNA match.</i>

411
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,800
Oh my God...

412
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,400
It's us, it's everything.

413
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,000
What killed them?

414
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:59,800
Big things have small beginnings.

415
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,500
Am I interrupting? Thought
you might be running low.

416
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:21,300
Pour yourself a glass pal. - Thank you,
but I'm afraid it would be wasted on me.

417
00:49:21,301 --> 00:49:25,300
Right, I almost forgot
you're not a real boy.

418
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,800
I'm very sorry that your engineers
are all gone, Dr. Holloway.

419
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:39,100
You think we wasted our
time coming here, don't you?

420
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:43,500
Your question depends on the understanding
what you hope to achieve by coming here.

421
00:49:43,501 --> 00:49:48,500
What we hoped to achieve, was to
meet our makers, to get answers.

422
00:49:48,501 --> 00:49:53,300
Why they even made
us in the first place.

423
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,400
Why do you think your people made me?

424
00:49:58,401 --> 00:50:01,400
We made you cos we could.

425
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,900
Can you imagine how
disappointing would be for you,

426
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:08,500
to hear the same thing
from your creator?

427
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,200
I guess it's a good thing
you can't be disappointed.

428
00:50:15,201 --> 00:50:21,000
Yes. It's wonderful actually.
May I ask you something?

429
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,600
Please do.
- How far would you go,

430
00:50:24,601 --> 00:50:29,600
to get what you came all
this way for? Your answers?

431
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,600
What would you be willing to do?
- Anything and everything.

432
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:36,901
That's worth drinking to, I'd imagine.

433
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,500
Here's mud in your eye, pal.

434
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,800
Good health.

435
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,200
It's those things.

436
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,500
Are they real?

437
00:51:08,501 --> 00:51:10,900
Of course they're real.

438
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:17,500
Jesus Christ, look at the pile,
look how up they are.

439
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,000
Looks like they were
running from something.

440
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:24,200
Don't touch, OK?

441
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:28,700
This thing is, opened
up from the inside,

442
00:51:28,701 --> 00:51:31,200
almost like its exploded.

443
00:51:31,201 --> 00:51:35,900
It's like a scene out of some
sort of holocaust painting.

444
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,900
Whatever killed them
is long gone, right?

445
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,300
Where is your position?
- Prometheus, this is Millburn.

446
00:52:05,301 --> 00:52:11,300
We are at 7401477, why?
- I just got a ping.

447
00:52:11,301 --> 00:52:15,700
About one click west of you.
- What do you mean, a ping?

448
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,700
Whatever that probe is
picking up, it's not dead.

449
00:52:20,701 --> 00:52:23,600
It's reading life form.

450
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:28,000
What do you mean a "life form"?
- Is it moving?

451
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:31,600
No, I don't think so.

452
00:52:31,601 --> 00:52:34,500
Captain, you're obviously not
seeing what we're seeing down here,

453
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:37,200
<i>but if you were, you wouldn't
be talking about bloody ping.</i>

454
00:52:37,201 --> 00:52:42,600
Boys, the signal's been coming
in sporadically since the storm hit.

455
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,500
<i>That's not good to us down here captain!</i>

456
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,700
<i>Is it moving? Are these things moving?</i>

457
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,800
No, it just disappeared actually.

458
00:52:56,801 --> 00:53:00,900
<i>Must be a glitch.
- What do you mean, "a glitch"?</i>

459
00:53:00,901 --> 00:53:04,800
Alright boys, sleep tight.

460
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:09,200
<i>Try not to bother each other.
- Captain, what do you mean "a glitch"?</i>

461
00:53:09,201 --> 00:53:12,200
Millburn wait!

462
00:53:12,201 --> 00:53:17,700
<i>He said, one click west?</i>

463
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,900
We don't want to go check
that out, do we? - Shit no.

464
00:53:22,901 --> 00:53:27,000
Where are we going to go?
- East.

465
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:33,000
Yeah east. - Glitch man,
glitches life form, what the fuck?!

466
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:37,300
Based on the behaviour of the subject
in these holographic recordings,

467
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:40,800
we're still attempting to identify
what caused the head to combust.

468
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:45,500
I can't help but wonder,
was there an outbreak here?

469
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,600
You rang, ma'am?
- I have something important to tell you.

470
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:58,800
What is that?
- This is a rose

471
00:53:58,801 --> 00:54:02,000
that I had frozen with the
champagne. I was going to give it to you

472
00:54:02,001 --> 00:54:04,800
when we found what we came for.

473
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:08,500
We did find what we came for.
They were here, this is...

474
00:54:08,501 --> 00:54:14,600
The most significant discovery
in the history of mankind.

475
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,700
I know.

476
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,800
It's incredible, it really is, but...

477
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:24,500
I wanted to talk to them.

478
00:54:24,501 --> 00:54:28,600
Don't you want to know why they came?

479
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:32,300
Why they abandoned us?
I just want answers baby.

480
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:37,600
We were right Charlie. I have proof.

481
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,500
Look.

482
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,600
Their genetic material predates ours.

483
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:54,100
We come from them.
- Are you kidding me? - No.

484
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,100
OK.

485
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,600
I guess you can take your
father's cross off now.

486
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:07,900
Why would I want to do that?

487
00:55:07,901 --> 00:55:11,600
Because they made us.
- And who made them?

488
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:16,400
Exactly, we'll never know.
But here's what we do know.

489
00:55:16,401 --> 00:55:20,500
There is nothing special
about the creation of life.

490
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:26,700
Anybody can do it, all you need is a
dash of DNA and half a brain, right?

491
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:33,800
I can't. I can't create life.

492
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,900
What does that say about me?

493
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:43,500
Ellie, that's not, I didn't mean...
I wasn't talking about...

494
00:55:43,501 --> 00:55:47,300
Children?
- Us.

495
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:01,600
Elizabeth Shaw, you are the most special
person I have ever met in my life.

496
00:56:01,601 --> 00:56:04,700
And I love you.

497
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,100
No.

498
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,600
How much longer is this going to take?

499
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:03,000
I don't know, I'm just the captain.

500
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,200
That thing sounds like
a dying cat, by the way.

501
00:57:13,201 --> 00:57:18,000
I'll have you know that this "thing"
once belonged to Steven Stills.

502
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,700
Am I supposed to know who that is?

503
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,900
You know...

504
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:30,200
If you want to get laid,
you really don't have

505
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:33,500
to pretend to be interested
in the pyramid scanner.

506
00:57:33,501 --> 00:57:37,200
I mean you could just say:
"Hey, I'm trying to get laid".

507
00:57:37,201 --> 00:57:40,300
I could say that, right?

508
00:57:40,301 --> 00:57:44,400
But then, it wouldn't make sense why
I'd find myself half a billion miles from

509
00:57:44,401 --> 00:57:49,700
every man on Earth, if I
wanted to get laid, would it?

510
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,200
Hey Vickers!

511
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,900
I was wondering...

512
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,600
Are you a robot?

513
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:15,400
My room, ten minutes.

514
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:37,600
Millburn, what's with this black stuff?

515
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,800
Gazpacho.

516
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,600
Is that tobacco? Is that
tobacco in your respirator?

517
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:51,900
Yeah, sure.

518
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,200
Tobacco.

519
00:58:57,201 --> 00:59:00,150
On behalf of scientists everywhere I am

520
00:59:00,151 --> 00:59:03,100
ashamed to count you
amongst us Fifield, really.

521
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,100
Millburn? - Yeah?
- Do you see this thing?

522
00:59:09,101 --> 00:59:12,900
What do you think this thing
was? Some kind of a god?

523
00:59:12,901 --> 00:59:16,200
Something they worshiped?

524
00:59:16,201 --> 00:59:20,900
What's that?!
- OK, just stay calm.

525
00:59:20,901 --> 00:59:24,900
Stay quiet, it is OK, I can handle this.

526
00:59:24,901 --> 00:59:28,400
Hey baby.

527
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:33,700
Come in Prometheus, we have a
elongated reptile type creature.

528
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:38,200
Maybe 30-40 inches,
with transparent skin.

529
00:59:38,201 --> 00:59:41,000
It's beautiful.

530
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:49,900
Prometheus, we have 2!
Look at you. Look at you baby.

531
00:59:49,901 --> 00:59:52,400
Jesus, look at the size
of that, what is it?

532
00:59:52,401 --> 00:59:54,700
You need to stay calm, OK?
- What's there to be calm about?

533
00:59:54,701 --> 00:59:57,500
You need to stay calm, she is beautiful.

534
00:59:57,501 --> 01:00:00,000
She? What the hell makes
you think that's female?

535
01:00:00,001 --> 01:00:02,600
She's a lady, look.

536
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:14,300
She's mesmerized. Come here.

537
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:18,300
It's OK, it's OK.

538
01:00:18,301 --> 01:00:21,600
Hey baby.

539
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,600
You're strong!
Maybe you should help me now, OK?!

540
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:28,600
Get it off man! OK?!

541
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:33,100
I isn’t touching that!

542
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,000
It's getting tighter. - I isn’t touching
that! Don't want to touch it!

543
01:00:37,001 --> 01:00:39,700
Touch the thing man! For God's sake...

544
01:00:39,701 --> 01:00:43,400
God! You're making it
worse! It's tightening!

545
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,800
It's breaking my arm!

546
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:52,600
Cut it off! Cut if off!

547
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,800
Oh my God!

548
01:01:01,801 --> 01:01:04,400
It's in my suit!

549
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:07,600
<i>Shaw, you up?</i>

550
01:02:07,601 --> 01:02:09,700
Yeah, what's up?

551
01:02:09,701 --> 01:02:12,400
<i>Storm's passed, but can't reach
Millburn and Fifield on the comm.,</i>

552
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:15,100
<i>Taking a few men down, to
see if we can rustle them up.</i>

553
01:02:15,101 --> 01:02:18,600
OK, any idea where they are?

554
01:02:18,601 --> 01:02:22,900
Last time they radioed in they were
just outside where you found your head.

555
01:02:22,901 --> 01:02:25,800
<i>OK, we're coming.</i>

556
01:02:25,801 --> 01:02:28,900
Chance, you're coming with me, come on.

557
01:02:28,901 --> 01:02:30,901
Alright boss.

558
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,949
Ravel, did you fix that glitch?

559
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,100
<i>No captain, it's got
to be in the hardware.</i>

560
01:02:36,101 --> 01:02:38,800
What glitch, captain?
- One of them probes

561
01:02:38,801 --> 01:02:44,900
picked up a life form, pops up every hour or
so for couple of seconds and then it's gone.

562
01:02:44,901 --> 01:02:47,100
I can find the probe and fix
it for you, if you'd like.

563
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:49,600
Knock yourself out.

564
01:02:49,601 --> 01:02:52,400
Be careful, doctor.

565
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,300
Fifield?!

566
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,700
Millburn?!

567
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,800
Right, come on down.

568
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,400
<i>David, are you alone?</i>

569
01:03:48,401 --> 01:03:52,500
<i>Yes miss Vickers.
- Up link your feed to my room.</i>

570
01:03:52,501 --> 01:03:55,000
Copy.

571
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,500
You son of a bitch.

572
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,700
He cut me off.

573
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,600
What is this?

574
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,100
Charlie?
- I just tripped.

575
01:06:10,101 --> 01:06:13,000
Oh my God, you're sick.
- I'm OK baby.

576
01:06:13,001 --> 01:06:18,200
Fifield? Millburn?

577
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:26,500
Hey Chance, I wouldn't
touch that if I were you.

578
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,600
Doctor Shaw?
- Yes?

579
01:06:31,601 --> 01:06:35,200
Do you have any idea
oozing out of these vases?

580
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:39,600
No, they weren't like this
last time we were here.

581
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:45,700
Captain!
- What?

582
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:49,000
Who is that? Which one?
- Who is it? - It's Millburn.

583
01:06:49,001 --> 01:06:52,400
Ellie. - Don't touch him!
- Ellie, honey?

584
01:06:52,401 --> 01:06:54,900
Charlie what's wrong?

585
01:06:54,901 --> 01:06:57,100
I need you to look at me, OK?

586
01:06:57,101 --> 01:06:59,700
You know infections so, what do you see?

587
01:06:59,701 --> 01:07:03,400
This is not good baby. - Ellie,
look at me and tell me what you see.

588
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:10,700
Oh my God.
Ford, get over here.

589
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,400
Janet! We have to go now!
- What do you see baby?

590
01:07:15,401 --> 01:07:19,800
Honey what do you see?
- Holloway's sick, he's not good!

591
01:07:19,801 --> 01:07:23,000
I see a movement in his oesophagus.

592
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,600
I'm OK.
- Janet, come over and help me!

593
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,800
Ford get over here! What's
happening over there?!

594
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,800
Help me with him!
- I'm ok...

595
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,801
I got you, I'm going to
get you out of here.

596
01:07:37,802 --> 01:07:41,300
Prometheus come in!
- I'm OK.

597
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,900
Get him up!

598
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:47,100
<i>Prometheus, come in! Is anyone there?</i>

599
01:07:47,101 --> 01:07:51,500
This is Vickers. - I need a medical
team standing by the air lock.

600
01:07:51,501 --> 01:07:55,200
<i>Full quarantine failsafe.
Holloway is sick.</i>

601
01:07:55,201 --> 01:07:58,500
Sick with what?
- Just do it.

602
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,700
No sitting out.

603
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,299
He don't look too good.
- Did he catch

604
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:12,600
something in there? We
had our helmets off...

605
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:16,900
I don't know. Prometheus this is
Janet, make sure that back door is open.

606
01:12:16,901 --> 01:12:18,901
<i>Aye, aye captain.</i>

607
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,000
I'm so sorry.

608
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,300
Please!

609
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:33,100
Vickers, why is that door not open?!

610
01:12:33,101 --> 01:12:37,300
Vickers, that is an order!
Get that goddamn door open!

611
01:12:37,301 --> 01:12:42,100
Look at me OK? It's too late, I'm sick.
- No it's not, come on!

612
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,300
Ford help me! - Airlock crew
if you can hear me, this is Janet

613
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:48,700
<i>open that back door right now!
- Hold that door!</i>

614
01:12:48,701 --> 01:12:52,800
<i>Do you copy? Goddamn it open
that door that is an order!</i>

615
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:56,100
Open it!

616
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,000
What the hell is this?
- He's not coming on board.

617
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:06,650
Vickers, this is a sick man!
- I can see that,

618
01:13:06,651 --> 01:13:09,300
that's why he's not coming on my ship!

619
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,600
Don't kill him!

620
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,900
Please, we can still help him!

621
01:13:17,901 --> 01:13:20,900
Help yourself. Everybody but
Holloway back on the ship, now!

622
01:13:20,901 --> 01:13:23,400
I won't leave him!
- Then stay!

623
01:13:23,401 --> 01:13:26,600
Wait a minute! We can contain
him, put him on a med-pod!

624
01:13:26,601 --> 01:13:30,700
Please don't do this!
- It's OK, Ellie. - Vickers!

625
01:13:30,701 --> 01:13:34,600
What are you doing?
- I love you baby. - No!

626
01:13:34,601 --> 01:13:38,600
I'm telling you, stay back!
- Do it. - Stay back!

627
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,400
Do it.

628
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:17,600
My deepest condolences.

629
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,200
I'm going to have to take
this, it may be contaminated.

630
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:27,400
If there's a contagion,
we were all exposed.

631
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:33,000
We need to run blood work on
everyone who set foot in the pyramid.

632
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:36,200
Yes of course.

633
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:47,800
I understand how inappropriate this is.

634
01:14:47,801 --> 01:14:50,400
Given the circumstances.

635
01:14:50,401 --> 01:14:55,100
But, as you ordered quarantine fail safes

636
01:14:55,101 --> 01:14:58,600
it's my responsibility to ask.

637
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:04,000
Have you and Dr. Holloway had
any intimate contact recently?

638
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:07,600
Since you and he were so, close,

639
01:15:07,601 --> 01:15:11,200
I just want to be as
thorough as possible.

640
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,100
My, my...

641
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,600
You're pregnant.

642
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:23,100
What?

643
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:28,600
From the look of it, three months.
- Well that's impossible.

644
01:15:28,601 --> 01:15:35,100
I can't be pregnant. - Did you
have intercourse with Dr. Holloway?

645
01:15:35,101 --> 01:15:39,600
Yes, but ten hours ago.

646
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:43,700
There's no bloody way
I'm three months pregnant.

647
01:15:43,701 --> 01:15:49,200
Well doctor, it's not
exactly a traditional fetus.

648
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:54,900
I want to see it.
- Don't think that's a good idea.

649
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,100
David, I want to see it.

650
01:15:59,101 --> 01:16:02,100
Now doctor...

651
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,300
I want to see it.

652
01:16:05,301 --> 01:16:08,300
I want it out of me.
- I'm afraid we don't have

653
01:16:08,301 --> 01:16:11,600
personnel to perform
the procedure like that.

654
01:16:11,601 --> 01:16:13,601
Our best option...
- I want it out.

655
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:18,000
To put you back into cryostasis...
- David, get it out of me.

656
01:16:18,001 --> 01:16:20,600
Get it out of me! Please...

657
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,000
Must be very painful.

658
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:30,900
Here, let me give you something.

659
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,300
That's it

660
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:48,100
Someone will be along shortly,
to bring you back to cryo-deck.

661
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,000
Must feel like your God abandoned you.
- What?

662
01:16:56,001 --> 01:17:02,200
To lose Dr. Holloway, after your father
died under such similar circumstances.

663
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:05,100
What was it that killed him?

664
01:17:05,101 --> 01:17:08,600
Ebola?

665
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,800
How do you know that?

666
01:17:14,801 --> 01:17:17,900
I watched your dreams.

667
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,400
Dr. Shaw?

668
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,600
We're here to put you in
an anti-contamination suit.

669
01:12:43,601 --> 01:12:47,600
Take you back to
cryo-deck, go to bed-e-byes.

670
01:12:47,601 --> 01:12:50,000
Dr. Shaw?

671
01:12:50,001 --> 01:12:53,100
She's totally doped, prepare her.

672
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,500
<i>Emergency procedure initiated.</i>

673
01:13:25,501 --> 01:13:28,100
<i>Please verbally state the
nature of your injury.</i>

674
01:13:28,101 --> 01:13:30,600
I need caesarean!

675
01:13:30,601 --> 01:13:33,800
<i>Error, this med-pod is
calibrated for male patients only.</i>

676
01:13:33,801 --> 01:13:36,100
<i>It does not have the
procedure you have requested.</i>

677
01:13:36,101 --> 01:13:39,400
<i>Please seek medical assistance...</i>

678
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:44,400
Surgery, abdominal...

679
01:13:44,401 --> 01:13:48,700
Penetrating injuries, foreign body...

680
01:13:48,701 --> 01:13:51,300
Initiate.

681
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,900
<i>Surgical procedure beginning.</i>

682
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,900
<i>Running diagnostics.</i>

683
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,700
Oh come on!

684
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,300
Get it out! Come on!

685
01:14:46,301 --> 01:14:48,400
Please!

686
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,500
Oh God!

687
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,200
<i>Initiating anaesthetics.</i>

688
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:07,500
<i>Commence surgical procedure.</i>

689
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,700
Oh God, oh my God!

690
01:16:31,100 --> 01:16:34,100
Come on!

691
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:02,700
<i>Bridge to hangar, this is the captain.
- Yes captain?</i>

692
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:06,400
Can you see what I'm seeing?
Fifield's monitor just popped up.

693
01:17:06,401 --> 01:17:08,700
What? Where?

694
01:17:08,701 --> 01:17:12,600
According to what I'm looking at,
it's right outside the goddamn ship.

695
01:17:12,601 --> 01:17:16,900
Barnes open the door!
- Fifield, do you copy me, come on in.

696
01:17:16,901 --> 01:17:19,000
Fifield?

697
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:32,300
Wait a second...

698
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:43,700
Hey Wallace, take a look at this.

699
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,800
Fifield?

700
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:54,900
What the hell is going on down there?!

701
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,000
I'm coming out. Chance,
we're suiting up, come on!

702
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,200
Take him out!

703
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,900
You ready Chance?!
- Yes.

704
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,900
You've been asleep...

705
01:20:03,901 --> 01:20:08,000
You were on the ship all this time, why?

706
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:12,700
I have a few days of life left in me.

707
01:20:12,701 --> 01:20:17,200
Don't want to waste them, till I was sure
that you could deliver what you promised.

708
01:20:17,201 --> 01:20:22,000
Meet my maker.
- Here we are sir, nice and clean.

709
01:20:22,001 --> 01:20:25,000
Haven't you told him they're all gone?

710
01:20:25,001 --> 01:20:28,300
But they're not all gone, Dr. Shaw.

711
01:20:28,301 --> 01:20:33,200
One of them is still alive.
We're on our way to see him now.

712
01:20:33,201 --> 01:20:36,400
What?
- Turn me round.

713
01:20:36,401 --> 01:20:41,600
You convinced me...

714
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:46,300
If these things made us...

715
01:20:46,301 --> 01:20:49,500
Then surely they could save us.

716
01:20:49,501 --> 01:20:52,200
My stick.

717
01:20:55,100 --> 01:21:00,500
Save me, anyway.
- Save you? From what?

718
01:21:00,501 --> 01:21:04,100
Death of course, stand me up.

719
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:19,200
You don't understand, you don't know,
this place isn't what we thought it was...

720
01:21:19,201 --> 01:21:21,500
They aren't what we thought they were.

721
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:24,900
I was wrong, we were so wrong.

722
01:21:24,901 --> 01:21:30,100
Charlie, Dr. Holloway is dead.

723
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:37,000
We must leave.
- And what would Charlie do, now?

724
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:42,400
We're so close to answering the most

725
01:21:42,401 --> 01:21:46,900
meaningful questions
ever asked by mankind.

726
01:21:46,901 --> 01:21:51,700
How can you leave without
knowing what they are?

727
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,900
Or have you lost your faith, Shaw?

728
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,100
Ok...

729
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,100
Come in.

730
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:08,100
Where the hell are you going doc?
You know what this place is?

731
01:23:08,101 --> 01:23:12,800
Those "engineers",
this isn’t their home.

732
01:23:12,801 --> 01:23:16,300
It's an installation, maybe even military.

733
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:19,300
They put it out here in the middle of
nowhere because they're not stupid enough

734
01:23:19,301 --> 01:23:23,000
to make weapons of mass
destruction on their own doorstep.

735
01:23:23,001 --> 01:23:27,000
That's what all that
shit is in those vases.

736
01:23:27,001 --> 01:23:33,300
They made it here, it got out,
it turned on them, the end.

737
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:37,100
It's time for us to go home.

738
01:23:37,101 --> 01:23:40,200
One of them is still alive.

739
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,100
Don't you want to know
what they have to say?

740
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,400
I don't care.

741
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:57,300
Right, all you do is fly this ship.

742
01:23:57,301 --> 01:24:00,200
That's right.

743
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:04,100
You must care about something, captain.

744
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:08,700
If you didn't, why are you here?

745
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:13,500
How about this.

746
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,400
No matter what happens down there,

747
01:24:17,401 --> 01:24:22,600
I can't bring none of that shit back
home with us, can't let it happen.

748
01:24:22,601 --> 01:24:26,800
And I'll do whatever I have
to, to see that it doesn't.

749
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:31,300
Make sure you do, captain.

750
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:49,300
You came after all.
- Thought you wanted me to.

751
01:24:49,301 --> 01:24:51,800
After all your vigorous
attempts to stop me

752
01:24:51,801 --> 01:24:54,300
from coming here, I'm
just surprised to see you.

753
01:24:54,301 --> 01:24:58,600
Alright David, leave us alone.
- Yes sir.

754
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:13,300
If you're really going down
there, you're going to die.

755
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:19,100
Very negative way of looking at things.

756
01:25:19,101 --> 01:25:21,900
Exactly why you should
have stayed at home.

757
01:25:21,901 --> 01:25:25,100
Did you really think I was going to
sit in a board room for years,

758
01:25:25,101 --> 01:25:30,500
arguing over who is in charge while
you go look for some miracle on some

759
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:35,500
godforsaken rock in the middle of space?

760
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:42,400
A king has his reign and then he dies.

761
01:25:42,401 --> 01:25:44,600
It's inevitable.

762
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:51,800
That is a natural order of things.

763
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:06,000
Anything else?

764
01:26:06,001 --> 01:26:08,900
No.

765
01:26:08,901 --> 01:26:12,100
Father.

766
01:26:12,101 --> 01:26:15,100
That's it.

767
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:28,600
I didn't think you had it in you.

768
01:26:28,601 --> 01:26:32,300
Sorry, poor choice of words.

769
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:37,600
Extraordinary survival
instincts, Elizabeth.

770
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:45,600
What happens when Weyland is not
around to program you anymore?

771
01:26:45,601 --> 01:26:49,400
I suppose I'll be free.
- You want that?

772
01:26:49,401 --> 01:26:53,300
What? Not a concept I'm familiar with.

773
01:26:53,301 --> 01:26:55,900
That being said,

774
01:26:55,901 --> 01:26:59,800
doesn't everyone want
their parents dead?

775
01:26:59,801 --> 01:27:02,200
I didn't.

776
01:27:02,201 --> 01:27:07,100
Dr. Shaw, I'm pleased you could join us.

777
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:24,000
You can take your helmet
off if you'd like sir. - Why?

778
01:27:24,001 --> 01:27:29,500
The air is perfectly breathable.
- You sure? - Positive.

779
01:27:29,501 --> 01:27:33,600
Wait, we still don't know
how Holloway got infected.

780
01:27:33,601 --> 01:27:36,500
If it's in the air...
- It's not.

781
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:41,700
How do you know that?
- Smells fine to me.

782
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:45,000
Shall we?
- Please.

783
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:52,900
The bridge is just up ahead.
- What is this?

784
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,100
It's a cargo hold.

785
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:08,200
<i>Janet, are you seeing this?</i>

786
01:28:08,201 --> 01:28:11,800
<i>How many is there Shaw?
- Thousands.</i>

787
01:28:11,801 --> 01:28:14,100
What the hell?

788
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:21,500
Ravel, give me those schematics.

789
01:28:21,501 --> 01:28:24,300
Putting it on the table now.

790
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:29,900
Strip away the dome, isolate
that area, bring it up.

791
01:28:29,901 --> 01:28:32,900
Bringing it up captain.

792
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:37,900
Enlarge that.

793
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:40,800
Rotate it.

794
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,100
That is a ship.

795
01:28:46,101 --> 01:28:49,100
Jesus Christ.

796
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,700
It's a goddamn ship.

797
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:58,500
A superior species, no doubt.

798
01:28:59,900 --> 01:29:05,500
Their hyper-sleep chambers,
would impress I trust.

799
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,699
So they were travelling somewhere?

800
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:19,200
I have managed to work
out the broad strokes.

801
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:23,100
It's fairly evident they were
in the process of leaving.

802
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,300
Before things went apart.

803
01:29:26,301 --> 01:29:29,500
Leaving to go where?

804
01:29:29,501 --> 01:29:33,500
Earth.
- Why?

805
01:29:33,501 --> 01:29:39,100
Sometimes to create,
one must first destroy.

806
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:44,000
Where is he, David?
- This way sir.

807
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:52,600
Sure he's alive?

808
01:29:52,601 --> 01:29:55,400
Absolutely.

809
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:02,900
<i>And you can speak to him?
- I believe I can.</i>

810
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:41,100
I'm alright!

811
01:30:41,101 --> 01:30:44,100
Speak to him David.

812
01:30:44,101 --> 01:30:47,700
Tell him we're here, just like he asked.
- Ask him where they're from.

813
01:30:47,701 --> 01:30:50,600
What are you doing?
- Ask him what's in his cargo,

814
01:30:50,601 --> 01:30:53,100
it killed his people.
- Shaw, enough.

815
01:30:53,101 --> 01:30:58,100
David... - You made it here, and
it was meant for us, why?

816
01:30:58,101 --> 01:31:01,600
Shaw enough! For God's sake shut her up.

817
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:04,800
I need to know why,
what did we do wrong?!

818
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:08,300
Why do you hate us?!

819
01:31:08,301 --> 01:31:10,800
<i>David continue, tell him why I came.</i>

820
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,600
No!

821
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:02,900
There's nothing...

822
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:09,400
I know.

823
01:32:09,401 --> 01:32:13,800
Have a good journey, Mr. Weyland.

824
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,600
Time to go home.

825
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:37,700
Mr. Chance, take us home.

826
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:02,800
Hey captain...
- What in the hell was that?

827
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:48,500
Prometheus, come in!

828
01:34:48,501 --> 01:34:53,600
<i>Shaw, is that you, copy?
- Janet, listen to me!</i>

829
01:34:53,601 --> 01:34:56,900
This ship is taking off! - What?
- What the hell is she talking about?

830
01:34:56,901 --> 01:35:00,100
You can't let it leave!
You have to stop it!

831
01:35:00,101 --> 01:35:03,100
We're not stopping anything
Shaw, we're going home.

832
01:35:03,101 --> 01:35:08,300
Janet if you don't stop it, there
won't be any home to go back to.

833
01:35:08,301 --> 01:35:12,000
It's carrying death, it's headed for Earth.

834
01:35:12,001 --> 01:35:16,700
Shaw, this is not a warship.
- I know, I know that.

835
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:21,600
But you must do it.
- Captain, let's go!

836
01:35:21,601 --> 01:35:25,100
Janet please believe me, please.

837
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,100
I told you to get the ship going.

838
01:35:42,101 --> 01:35:46,100
Mr. Ravel, warm up the ion propulsion.
- What the hell are you talking about?

839
01:35:46,101 --> 01:35:48,050
Sir, burning the ion in
the inner atmosphere...

840
01:35:48,051 --> 01:35:50,000
Turns us into a bullet,
that is exactly the point.

841
01:35:50,001 --> 01:35:54,400
What the hell are you doing? Janet this
is my ship, I'm telling you to take us home!

842
01:35:54,401 --> 01:35:56,500
Vickers I'm going to
eject your life support

843
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:58,600
module onto that surface,
that's 2 years of life.

844
01:35:58,601 --> 01:36:01,500
You want it or do you want to stay with me?

845
01:36:01,501 --> 01:36:04,300
You have 40 seconds to
get to the escape pod.

846
01:36:04,301 --> 01:36:08,800
You're crazy.
- Gentlemen, I can handle this myself.

847
01:36:08,801 --> 01:36:11,400
Feel free to join miss Vickers.

848
01:36:11,401 --> 01:36:14,350
With all due respect
captain, you're a shit pilot

849
01:36:14,351 --> 01:36:17,300
and you're going to need
all the help you can get.

850
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:40,300
If you think this means the bet's off,

851
01:36:40,301 --> 01:36:43,100
you're wrong.

852
01:36:43,101 --> 01:36:45,900
Why don't you pay me on the other side?

853
01:36:45,901 --> 01:36:50,200
Get us as close as we can,
only got one shot at this.

854
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:06,000
Life boat's away.

855
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:11,900
<i>20 seconds to evacuate.</i>

856
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:22,200
Countdown initiated.
- Lon propulsion is online.

857
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:26,200
Come on!

858
01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:40,500
Alright gentlemen, let's do it!

859
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,300
<i>Impact imminent!
- Hands on!</i>

860
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,800
No!

861
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:32,300
Oh God...

862
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:51,600
<i>Warning, you have 2 minutes
of oxygen remaining.</i>

863
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:44,100
<i>Warning, you have 30 seconds
of oxygen remaining.</i>

864
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,600
<i>Airlock sealed.</i>

865
01:40:59,601 --> 01:41:03,100
<i>Oxygen levels now stabilizing.</i>

866
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:22,600
<i>Elizabeth, are you there?</i>

867
01:42:22,601 --> 01:42:25,100
<i>This is David.</i>

868
01:42:25,101 --> 01:42:27,400
Yeah, I'm here.

869
01:42:27,800 --> 01:42:30,600
You need to get out, immediately.

870
01:42:30,601 --> 01:42:33,400
<i>He's coming for you.
- Who's coming?</i>

871
01:42:33,401 --> 01:42:36,000
<i>Airlock breach!</i>

872
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:47,000
Die!

873
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:13,700
I am so sorry...

874
01:44:13,701 --> 01:44:16,100
Oh God...

875
01:44:16,101 --> 01:44:21,600
I am so sorry, I'm sorry
Charlie, I can't do it.

876
01:44:21,601 --> 01:44:26,100
I can't do it anymore.

877
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:33,300
<i>Elizabeth? Are you there?</i>

878
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:41,700
<i>Dr. Shaw, can you hear me?</i>

879
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:44,000
Yes.

880
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:47,400
<i>Yes I can hear you.</i>

881
01:44:47,401 --> 01:44:50,800
I was afraid you were dead.

882
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:54,800
You have no idea what afraid is.

883
01:44:54,801 --> 01:44:58,800
I know we've had our differences.

884
01:44:58,801 --> 01:45:03,600
But please, I need to
ask you for your help.

885
01:45:03,601 --> 01:45:07,400
<i>Why in hell would I help you?</i>

886
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:12,600
Because without me, you
will never leave this place.

887
01:45:12,601 --> 01:45:16,200
Neither one of us is leaving this place.

888
01:45:16,201 --> 01:45:19,700
It's not the only ship.

889
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:22,900
<i>There are many others.</i>

890
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:26,600
I can operate them.

891
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:36,800
Dr. Shaw?

892
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,700
Dr. Shaw!

893
01:45:50,701 --> 01:45:53,600
Over here!

894
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:00,200
Where's my cross?

895
01:46:00,201 --> 01:46:03,300
The pouch in my utility belt.

896
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:25,100
Even after all this, you
still believe, don't you?

897
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:29,300
You said you could
understand the navigation.

898
01:46:29,301 --> 01:46:32,400
Use their maps.

899
01:46:32,401 --> 01:46:34,500
Yes of course.

900
01:46:34,501 --> 01:46:37,000
Once we get to one of their other ships,

901
01:46:37,001 --> 01:46:40,600
finding a path to Earth should
be relatively straightforward.

902
01:46:40,601 --> 01:46:45,000
I don't want to go back
to where we came from.

903
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:49,200
I want to go where they came from.

904
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:53,100
You think you can do that David?

905
01:46:55,900 --> 01:46:59,600
Yes, I believe I can.

906
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:12,300
May I ask what you hope
to achieve by going there?

907
01:47:12,301 --> 01:47:16,600
They created us, then
they tried to kill us.

908
01:47:16,601 --> 01:47:20,000
They changed their minds.

909
01:47:20,001 --> 01:47:23,300
I deserve to know why.

910
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:26,700
The answer is irrelevant.

911
01:47:26,701 --> 01:47:29,700
Does it matter why they
changed their minds?

912
01:47:29,701 --> 01:47:33,800
Yes, yes it does.

913
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:39,000
I don't understand.
- Well...

914
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:43,800
I guess that's because I am human being.

915
01:47:43,801 --> 01:47:47,900
And you are a robot.

916
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:58,600
I'm sorry.
- It's quite alright.

917
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:15,600
<i>Final report of the vessel Prometheus.</i>

918
01:48:15,601 --> 01:48:19,000
<i>The ship and her entire crew are gone.</i>

919
01:48:19,001 --> 01:48:24,600
<i>If you're receiving this transmission, make
no attempt to come to its point of origin.</i>

920
01:48:24,601 --> 01:48:29,600
<i>There's only death here now,
and I'm leaving it behind.</i>

921
01:48:29,601 --> 01:48:35,600
<i>It is new year's day, a
year of our Lord, 2094.</i>

922
01:48:35,601 --> 01:48:42,000
<i>My name is Elizabeth Shaw,
last survivor of the Prometheus.</i>

923
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:45,800
<i>And I am still searching.</i>

924
01:49:45,801 --> 01:49:55,801
