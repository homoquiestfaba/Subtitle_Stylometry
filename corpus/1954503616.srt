1
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:48,714
<i>Dr. Behar.</i>

2
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,816
<i>Dr. Behar.</i>

3
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:54,108
<i>We're running out of
light, so if we're going</i>

4
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:56,947
<i>to do this we should
probably do it now.</i>

5
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,794
<i>Ready when you are.</i>

6
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:06,298
<i>We are now standing in front</i>
<i>of what I'm almost certain</i>

7
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,436
<i>to be the tomb of the lost
brother of King Siptah</i>

8
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:14,540
<i>who once ruled over the upper</i>
<i>and lower Egyptian valley</i>

9
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:15,941
<i>more than 2,000 years ago.</i>

10
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:21,580
<i>Everyone, including my peers, believed his
existence to be nothing more than a myth.</i>

11
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:25,350
<i>Well, we are now</i>
<i>about to prove them wrong.</i>

12
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,785
<i>For what you are seeing</i>
<i>behind me now</i>

13
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:33,358
<i>is the entrance to the tomb of what the
ancient Hebrews called the Cursed King.</i>

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,527
<i>Just the mere</i>
<i>mention of his name</i>

15
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:40,199
<i>was so utterly terrifying</i>
<i>to the ancient Egyptians</i>

16
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:43,202
<i>that even the symbol</i>
<i>for his name, the cat,</i>

17
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:47,539
<i>could not so much as be written
or pronounced by anyone.</i>

18
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:51,176
<i>Now won't you please</i>
<i>follow me, uh, Steven?</i>

19
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:58,317
<i>You see, Neferu,</i>
<i>the son of Harcoptis</i>

20
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,220
<i>was in succession</i>
<i>to be the king</i>

21
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,922
<i>when his younger brother Siptah</i>

22
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:08,694
<i>had him captured and mummified</i>
<i>while still alive.</i>

23
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:15,801
<i>And right down these tunnels</i>

24
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:16,902
<i>is where he was buried.</i>

25
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:19,438
<i>And this is where</i>
<i>we believe we will find him,</i>

26
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,408
<i>the king who cannot be named.</i>

27
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,129
<i>What was that, Steven?</i>

28
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,064
<i>What was that?</i>

29
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,502
<i>Jesus, what is that?</i>

30
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,672
<i>No. No! Jesus Christ!</i>

31
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,390
<i>I am a collector.</i>

32
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,525
<i>Treasures is what I seek.</i>

33
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:19,031
<i>I have possessed the most precious
riches the world has ever known.</i>

34
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:23,635
<i>The rarest,</i>
<i>the most magnificent.</i>

35
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:27,573
<i>But one has eluded me</i>
<i>for all these years.</i>

36
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:31,743
<i>A precious jewel,</i>
<i>shrouded in mystery,</i>

37
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:33,579
<i>wrought with danger.</i>

38
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:38,050
<i>It belonged</i>
<i>to a cursed king, Neferu,</i>

39
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:44,356
<i>a pharaoh, who some say still
haunts his final resting place,</i>

40
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,058
<i>seeking new victims.</i>

41
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:53,232
<i>A pharaoh who was buried
alongside a most precious stone.</i>

42
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,401
<i>A jewel of immense worth</i>

43
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,937
<i>and incredible power.</i>

44
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,506
<i>They call it,</i>

45
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,910
<i>the Kodek stone.</i>

46
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,579
<i>Only one man</i>

47
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,548
<i>can get it for me.</i>

48
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,019
<i>And his name is, Jack Wells.</i>

49
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:46,952
Hey, sexy.

50
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,699
<i>Like the presents?</i>

51
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,966
Carl?

52
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:37,636
What have you gone
and joined the NSA?

53
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:42,874
<i>- You do live an exciting life</i>
<i>for an archeology professor.</i>

54
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,043
I do what I can, Carl.

55
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,913
We're gonna be in the hot tub.

56
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,985
I suppose I have to thank you
for this package.

57
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,821
<i>Don't mention it.</i>

58
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:07,866
<i>It suits you.</i>

59
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,668
My birthday is still
a few months away,

60
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,472
so I suspect an ulterior motive

61
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:16,341
for this little
surprise of yours.

62
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,176
<i>Look closer.</i>

63
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,846
<i>That's right,</i>

64
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,948
<i>the camera's in the glasses.</i>

65
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,949
So you can see all this?

66
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,685
<i>I'm watching</i>
<i>everything that you are.</i>

67
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:31,523
<i>You're new glasses are transmitting
via a satellite uplink</i>

68
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,925
<i>to the comfort of my home.</i>

69
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,695
<i>You're eyes belong to me, Jack.</i>

70
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:37,929
I'll be a son of a bitch.

71
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,866
And how the hell did you get
your hands on these?

72
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,868
<i>I called in a favor</i>
<i>from a friend.</i>

73
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,002
You must have
some important friends,

74
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:46,671
this is not your standard
over-the-counter technology.

75
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:49,074
<i>I have my sources,</i>
<i>like you have yours.</i>

76
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,643
<i>There's something else</i>
<i>in the box.</i>

77
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,545
What's this?

78
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,248
<i>Something to make life easier.</i>

79
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,082
I hope it's sanitary.

80
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,952
<i>Stop fucking around, Jack,</i>
<i>time is of essence.</i>

81
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,487
<i>You hear me?</i>

82
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,189
Yeah, like you're
living in my head.

83
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,259
<i>Should keep us in contact</i>
<i>at all times.</i>

84
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:10,328
Okay, Santa, I got the gifts.

85
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,863
Now what do you want from me?

86
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,932
<i>I believe you know,</i>
<i>Jeremy Cooper.</i>

87
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:18,003
Yep, he is the biggest asshole
in the world of archeology.

88
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:23,175
<i>Indeed, but the asshole</i>
<i>is putting together a team</i>

89
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:24,142
<i>and I want you on it.</i>

90
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:27,245
What makes you think,
he'd want me to tag along?

91
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:28,079
He's not my biggest fan.

92
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,615
<i>You're still the best</i>
<i>Egyptologist he knows</i>

93
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,585
<i>and you can decipher</i>
<i>hieroglyphics</i>

94
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,454
<i>like you were born</i>
<i>speaking that gibberish.</i>

95
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:39,858
<i>Where he's going, he's gonna
need someone like you.</i>

96
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,428
<i>Strike that,</i>
<i>he's gonna need you.</i>

97
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,831
Hmm. Where's he going?

98
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:49,434
<i>His team is flying to Hijaza</i>
<i>in three days.</i>

99
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:52,003
Hijaza? What the hell
are they doing there?

100
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,271
<i>Neferu.</i>

101
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:56,041
Neferu, the cursed king?
Come on.

102
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:56,942
Carl, that's a myth.

103
00:07:56,944 --> 00:08:00,445
<i>Not anymore,</i>
<i>according to Professor Behar.</i>

104
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:01,613
<i>He's very much real.</i>

105
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:05,116
Behar? Hey, didn't he drop out of sight
two months ago while he was in Egypt?

106
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:09,621
<i>He did, but some Bedouins found his
camera out in the middle of nowhere.</i>

107
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,957
<i>Egyptian officials</i>
<i>got a hold of it.</i>

108
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:17,462
<i>The footage showed a tomb he
uncovered in the desert near Hijaza.</i>

109
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,431
<i>Cooper wants to find it.</i>

110
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,234
Now, Carl why do you care
so much about a tomb?

111
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:26,404
I never figured you to be interested
in anything other than money.

112
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,106
<i>That I am.</i>

113
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,809
<i>You ever hear of</i>
<i>the Kodek stone?</i>

114
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,177
Yeah, the diamond.

115
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,178
<i>Yes, the diamond.</i>

116
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,414
<i>Story goes that it was buried</i>
<i>with the cursed king,</i>

117
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,950
<i>a very precious gift</i>
<i>from his brother Siptah,</i>

118
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:42,220
<i>to keep, Neferu's soul</i>
<i>from coming back.</i>

119
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:48,059
<i>Cursed kings had a bad habit of
rising from the dead back then</i>

120
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:52,364
<i>and doing all sorts of</i>
<i>bad stuff to the living.</i>

121
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,533
So, you're after
the Kodek stone.

122
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,835
What, you're too lazy
to do your own dirty work?

123
00:08:56,837 --> 00:09:00,372
<i>I rather you get out there and
break your neck, it's much easier.</i>

124
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,340
Very altruistic Carl,
as always.

125
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:07,679
<i>You get me the stone and you
and me will call it even.</i>

126
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,648
<i>Wipe the slate clean.</i>

127
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,850
What if I tell you
to go fuck yourself?

128
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:12,517
<i>Well...</i>

129
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,887
<i>Then the Egyptian authorities</i>
<i>will receive a file</i>

130
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,857
<i>proving that</i>
<i>the Howard Carter artifacts</i>

131
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,792
<i>aren't as genuine</i>
<i>as they think.</i>

132
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:26,064
<i>And the details of your
involvement in their replacement.</i>

133
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,734
Guess I better go
grab my toothbrush, Carl.

134
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:30,095
I'm not that surprised the Behar
was searching the cursed earth.

135
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:34,666
He always insisted that Neferu's
tomb had to be out here somewhere.

136
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,102
It would have been
a great insult to his brother.

137
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,105
And it would have prevented his soul
from crossing over to the afterlife.

138
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:44,009
What do you think, Dr. Wells, are
we looking in the right place?

139
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,978
<i>Dr. Wells?</i>

140
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:49,948
What was the question?

141
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,252
We were wondering, if you think
we're looking in the right place.

142
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:58,256
The Bedouins claim they found
Behar's camera out there

143
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,291
chances are he was with it.

144
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,960
<i>Well, they could have stolen it</i>

145
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:06,698
stumbled across Behar and his assistant,
killed them and raided their equipment.

146
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,565
<i>Keep your mind</i>
<i>on the job, Jack,</i>

147
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:12,303
<i>you're not there to add another
notch to your bedpost.</i>

148
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,207
They only had
the camera with them.

149
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,844
Behar would have had thousands of
dollars of equipment with him.

150
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:20,945
Isn't that right, Dr. Cooper?

151
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:23,248
<i>He had access</i>
<i>to the latest equipment,</i>

152
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,218
geo-physical, thermo and
access to full GPS systems.

153
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,889
No self-respecting university would
have signed off on the search.

154
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,323
Yet, we've all seen the footage

155
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:35,060
and we're all here
following in his footsteps.

156
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,462
<i>Someone at Brown's</i>
<i>might have signed the check.</i>

157
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:41,332
I may not agree with many,
if any, of Behar's theories,

158
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,334
but he had clearly
found a tomb.

159
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:46,604
We owe it to him to prove
that he was right or not.

160
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,739
Talking like he's already dead.

161
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:51,309
Well, there's been no contact
with him for over three months.

162
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,278
If he's not dead,
he's as good as.

163
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,446
And nobody's concerned why?

164
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,948
Well, that's why
you brought me along.

165
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,017
What do you do, Kate?

166
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,619
I work for
a private security firm.

167
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:04,456
Oh, let me stop you before
you make a fool of yourself

168
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:08,860
by making some crass
chauvinistic remark, Dr. Wells.

169
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,096
I know I'm a woman.

170
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:13,498
And why are you here,
Dr. Wells?

171
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,867
What use do we have
of your talents?

172
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,336
Dr. Wells is an Egyptologist.

173
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:19,671
One of the best.

174
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,740
He specializes
in regional dialects.

175
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,608
Oh, I've heard differently.

176
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,343
If you're talking
about the little scrape I had

177
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,178
with the Egyptian authorities
last year,

178
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,514
regarding the
tomb of Kaumudi's artifacts.

179
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:32,550
And I can absolutely guarantee you,
it was just a miscommunication.

180
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:36,121
There's no need to explain
yourself to me, Dr. Wells.

181
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,356
<i>Sounds like your</i>
<i>reputation precedes you.</i>

182
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:42,093
Sounds like your
reputation precedes you.

183
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,798
What about the Kodek stone?
Do you believe that's real?

184
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,600
Kodek stone is a myth.

185
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:51,803
Behar believed it was real.
Based his entire career on it.

186
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:53,037
Yeah, look where it got him.

187
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,541
Anyone who believes the Kodek
stone is real is a fool.

188
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:59,477
<i>- You talking to me?</i>
- Anyone.

189
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,921
- What do they want?
- It'll be nothing.

190
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:11,356
Probably want to see
our papers.

191
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:15,193
And if they're a problem, I'm
sure they can be persuaded.

192
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,575
Papers, please.

193
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,884
- Don't...
- What?

194
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,153
Cause any trouble.

195
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,356
Leave that to me.

196
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,567
They want to see
all of our papers.

197
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,705
Passport. Passport.
Where's my passport?

198
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:03,474
- Calm down, bookworm.
- What?

199
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:06,377
And try to breathe
every once in a while.

200
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,347
Passport, Dr. Wells.

201
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,120
I trust everything is in order.

202
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,560
On your way, be careful.

203
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,628
People have been
known to go missing.

204
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,399
Although it would be very bad for such
a pretty lady never to be seen again.

205
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:15,079
What's got you
looking so worried?

206
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,115
I always look worried.

207
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,383
Probably because
I'm always worried.

208
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:23,955
You shouldn't be. I might not like
Cooper, but he knows what he's doing.

209
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,959
You've seen Behar's
footage, right?

210
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:28,760
Yeah.

211
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,729
-I think he was onto something.
-Yeah.

212
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,865
Just got me so worried.

213
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,868
Let's get back on the road.

214
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,832
Everyone out.

215
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,604
Ladies first.

216
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:17,575
Never claimed I was a lady,
but I appreciate the offer.

217
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:21,145
<i>Eyes on the prize, Jack,</i>
<i>not the ass.</i>

218
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,449
Look like a prize to me.
Who's the Egyptian?

219
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:25,483
<i>He's your guide, Rashid Hassan</i>

220
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:30,421
<i>and he comes highly recommended,
so try not to insult him.</i>

221
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:30,989
Do my best.

222
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:35,293
<i>He was a leading figure with the
rebels who overthrew Hosni Mubarak.</i>

223
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,261
What's he doing here
in the ass end of nowhere?

224
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:41,032
<i>Some of his views were
considered by many as extreme.</i>

225
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:44,402
<i>Let's say he just needed</i>
<i>a change of air.</i>

226
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:45,169
Can we trust him?

227
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:49,807
<i>I don't know about that, but he knows this
cursed earth better than any man alive.</i>

228
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,610
I'd like you in the lead
with Hassan.

229
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,947
I think I'll join in.

230
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,695
Jack Wells, Egyptologist.

231
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,964
Hassan.

232
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,770
Dr. Behar was very
passionate man.

233
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:23,808
What he didn't know about Siptah,
Neferu wasn't worth knowing.

234
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,110
You knew him well, then?

235
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:29,047
Yes, ever since
I was young boy.

236
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:31,849
My father was his guide,
and I took over.

237
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,452
So, you took him
into the cursed earth?

238
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,587
Yes, many time.

239
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:40,024
He was constantly
searching for the tomb.

240
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,860
And when he went missing?

241
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:47,265
On that instance, the good
doctor ventured out alone.

242
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,268
He didn't want anyone
to know his location.

243
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,503
With age he grew paranoid.

244
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:56,574
He believed everyone was out
to steal the find from him.

245
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,576
Take the glory.

246
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,612
What do you think
happened to him, Hassan?

247
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:05,516
The cursed earth is not the
safest place for a man to walk.

248
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:08,486
He could have easily been
turned around in a sand storm,

249
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,254
died of exposure.

250
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,423
You believe that?

251
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,427
Sand is very hungry, Dr. Wells.

252
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,130
If you don't tread carefully,

253
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,166
it will bite.

254
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,876
<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>the cursed earth, Jack.</i>

255
00:18:31,878 --> 00:18:34,745
I can think of places,
I'd rather be.

256
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,614
We all could.

257
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,620
Maybe when we're done here.

258
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,956
Is that a come on, Dr. Wells?

259
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,925
Jack, call me Jack.

260
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,062
I hate all that
"Doctor" bullshit.

261
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,964
Okay, Jack.

262
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,902
Maybe when we're done.

263
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,372
<i>I don't believe this.</i>

264
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,309
Come,

265
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:09,614
once you've unpacked and set up
camp I've arranged for food.

266
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,015
And then we sleep.

267
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,417
We have much traveling
to do tomorrow.

268
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:22,426
<i>What the hell's going on, Jack?</i>

269
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:24,195
We're about to find out.

270
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:39,577
<i>Seems like Hassan hasn't been
greasing the right palms.</i>

271
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,013
It's just what we need.

272
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:47,585
Put the gun down, you all, now.

273
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,789
Let go of me!

274
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,926
Your man touched me first!

275
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,835
What seems to be
the problem here?

276
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:08,272
This is a restricted area,
you must not be here.

277
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:11,776
I can assure I've been granted
full access to this area

278
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:13,945
for myself and my team.

279
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,813
You show me.

280
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,824
<i>It's time for you to take over.</i>

281
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:27,825
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

282
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:32,363
<i>Exactly what I tell you, now get
over there and sound authoritative.</i>

283
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:36,534
These are not valid. That's
impossible, check them again.

284
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:41,372
I'll deal with this. Not valid.
You must go.

285
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,473
Who are you?

286
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,675
<i>-Who I am is of no concern...
</i> Who I am is of no concern,

287
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,410
<i>- ...who I know is.</i>
- Who I know is.

288
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,178
And who do you know?

289
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,248
<i>- Naseem Abubakar.</i>
- Naseem Abubakar.

290
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:54,485
I see you know the name.

291
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:58,389
Well, if you continue to fuck
with me and my colleagues

292
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:01,392
Naseem will fuck with you,
understand?

293
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,293
<i>Don't, don't push it, Jack.</i>

294
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:07,231
On your way, but you may
regret the decision later.

295
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,989
From here, we will
have to travel by foot.

296
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,525
Why can't we just
take the cars?

297
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,761
Look for yourself.

298
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,331
Beyond the horizon

299
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,833
lies a cursed earth.

300
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,202
The cursed earth.

301
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,139
Yes, Dr. Wells.

302
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:33,017
<i>Behar's last GPS signal puts him within
a day's travel of you current location.</i>

303
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:38,089
You're quite sure this is
where Dr. Behar was heading?

304
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:41,258
This is what he told me, yes.

305
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,433
What made him think, he'd
find Neferu's tomb out here?

306
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,236
He did not say.

307
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,639
But he knew,

308
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,876
you could see it in his eyes.

309
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,854
You okay there, Marty?

310
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,289
Oh, I'm fine,

311
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:48,626
this body was built
for the great outdoors.

312
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,468
I don't get you, Jack Wells.

313
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,603
What's there to get?

314
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,440
- I read about you.
- And?

315
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,277
Definitely makes
for an interesting read.

316
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,279
You studied at Harvard,

317
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,980
you graduated
the top of your class,

318
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,383
and then you stepped
straight into a job

319
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:14,485
at the Archeological
Institute of America...

320
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,353
Oh, God!

321
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,022
Thanks.

322
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,127
Then you spent
six years in Egypt,

323
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,763
mostly working in Abu Rawash

324
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,698
and that's when things got
a little shady.

325
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:33,571
It seems you were accused of
falsifying King Tafari's seal?

326
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,140
Accused, never convicted.

327
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,142
Is there a difference?

328
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,644
About eight to 15.

329
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,547
Well, from
what I've seen so far,

330
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,916
you don't seem
like that guy at all.

331
00:24:45,918 --> 00:24:48,185
Maybe I'll surprise you.

332
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,021
Maybe.

333
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,656
<i>-I want you to look at something.
</i> What?

334
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:07,224
<i>- Something you've missed.</i>
- Where?

335
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,894
<i>-Over to the left.</i> Okay,
what am I looking at?

336
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,030
<i>You don't see it, do you?</i>

337
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,100
<i>The rock formation.</i>

338
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,801
<i>Look at the shape</i>
<i>of that rock formation,</i>

339
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:21,505
<i>they're the same as the one</i>
<i>on Behar's video.</i>

340
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:25,409
<i>We're close,</i>
<i>so close I can taste it.</i>

341
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,654
The history books are vague.

342
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:39,757
Most stating that Neferu was
the worst of the two brothers.

343
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:45,029
But there are many writings that purport
to Siptah having been far more nasty.

344
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,798
The writings are true.

345
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,000
Both brothers were corrupt.

346
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,568
But, no brother could do

347
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,806
what Siptah did to Neferu without
having evil in their veins.

348
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,710
If what I've read
about Neferu is true

349
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:01,712
he deserved what he got.

350
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:06,550
His army rode through Egypt,
slaughtering everyone in its path.

351
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:09,386
Power corrupts, my friend.

352
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:14,658
And the brothers held more power in their
hands than any man should ever hold.

353
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,228
But Siptah,
wasn't satisfied with sharing,

354
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,964
he wanted it all to himself.

355
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,234
So, he had his brother killed.

356
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,270
That's not uncommon
for the time though.

357
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:29,540
Many pharaohs acquired
their power through murder.

358
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,875
There is murder

359
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,279
and there is torture.

360
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:40,050
Siptah ordered that Neferu

361
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,552
be nailed to the ground

362
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:47,191
and his chest be cut open
while he was still breathing

363
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:51,795
and then had salt poured onto
his still beating heart.

364
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:55,499
He was screaming for mercy,

365
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:59,136
as they cut away
his nose with a chisel

366
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:05,175
and forced a barbed hook
all the way up into his skull.

367
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:09,179
Lady here needs a drink.

368
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,926
Cooper.

369
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:42,780
<i>- We're getting close, Jack.</i>
- Over and out, Carl.

370
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:46,083
I think it's time I turned off
that little voice in my head.

371
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,720
- Hey.
- Hey.

372
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,789
- You forgot this.
- Oh...

373
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,690
Who were you
just talking to by the way?

374
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:56,260
Oh, just a little
voice in my head.

375
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:59,663
You're not going to let me
finish this by myself are you?

376
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:03,267
I think there's something else
I'd like to finish.

377
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,503
Keeping your eyes
on the prize, huh, Jack?

378
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,106
Kind of hard not to.

379
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,648
Ooh.

380
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:22,486
-You're not getting shy on me now are you?
-Get over here.

381
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,758
I guess there could be
worst places we could be.

382
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,129
-Really? I can't think of any
place I'd rather be. -Me, too.

383
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,404
<i>She's something else, Jack,</i>

384
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,440
<i>isn't, she?</i>

385
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,342
- What the hell?
- What?

386
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:49,580
It's just the little
voice in my head again.

387
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,290
Sorry, three's a crowd.

388
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,712
Hey,

389
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,281
about last night.

390
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:26,917
You don't have
to say anything, Kate.

391
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,785
I get it,

392
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:30,354
it was what it was.

393
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:33,557
You needed me and I needed you.

394
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,926
Nothing more, nothing less.

395
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:40,197
<i>You really know</i>
<i>how to treat a woman.</i>

396
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:44,501
Quit playing with the hired
help, Wells, and get over here.

397
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,070
Asshole.

398
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,505
Me or him? - Both.

399
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:50,073
<i>She's growing on me.</i>

400
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:52,676
Piss off, Carl.

401
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:55,979
Take a look at this,
tell me what you think.

402
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,180
What am I looking for?

403
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,116
I just want your opinion.

404
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:02,386
Dr. Cooper! Dr. Cooper!

405
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,454
You're gonna want to see this.

406
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,957
What it is, Baptiste?

407
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,293
I was taking a leak

408
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:10,427
and I think I found it.

409
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,597
What you find, Greg, your cock?

410
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,901
No, asshole,
the entrance to the tomb.

411
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,170
I found it.

412
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,942
That's great!

413
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:43,260
This is it people,
this is the tomb of Neferu.

414
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:44,695
I shall get camp ready.

415
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:47,297
Good man, Hassan, good man.

416
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:51,835
But this is clearly the same
place as on Behar's video.

417
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,638
Dr. Wells is right.

418
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,474
This may be where Behar
filmed his last footage.

419
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,443
No proof this is the
final resting place of Neferu.

420
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:04,681
No proof yet, but there will
be as soon as we get inside.

421
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,276
If any of you
still needed proof.

422
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,245
What is it, Dr. Cooper?

423
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,514
Hieroglyphics.

424
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,051
And this right here,

425
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,920
this is the katak,
the eye of the jackal,

426
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:46,423
it's the symbol of King Neferu.

427
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:47,858
Oh, it's magnificent.

428
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,825
This is the final
resting place...

429
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:51,595
Think about it, we could be the
first eyes cast upon his name

430
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:53,930
in over 2,000 years.

431
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:57,601
Unless Behar saw it before us.

432
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,404
I've got to record this.

433
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:01,972
Kate,

434
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,307
- are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

435
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:08,011
Wells, I need...
We need your assistance.

436
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,680
You'll be okay?

437
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,315
I'm a big girl, Jack.
Go do your job.

438
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:16,319
<i>You heard the lady,</i>
<i>show me something exciting.</i>

439
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,792
- What does it say?
- Enlighten us.

440
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:26,329
This is rough. It's a dialect
I've not seen before.

441
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,666
But you can read it,
right, Jack?

442
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:32,936
Yeah, just give me a minute.

443
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:37,140
I hope I haven't wasted
funds, bringing you along.

444
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:38,742
You really don't like me
do you, Cooper?

445
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,945
This has nothing to do with my
personal feelings towards you.

446
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:45,015
Can you decipher
the glyphs or not?

447
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,755
Here lies the cursed king

448
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,825
under the heel of Anubis

449
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,861
and body on Aken's ferry,

450
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,568
the soul in between.

451
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:08,371
It's amazing,
it's simply amazing.

452
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:11,308
Is that the exact
translation, Wells?

453
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:13,710
Words to that effect.

454
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,279
There's more over here.

455
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:33,997
The <i> tilasm</i> will keep him

456
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,133
in the tomb.

457
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,136
A tealsman?

458
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,939
That's Arabic,
for the talisman.

459
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:47,010
Is it talking about
the Kodek stone?

460
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:48,111
Siptah buried
his brother with that.

461
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:51,014
He had to keep Neferu's soul from
coming back and avenging himself.

462
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:54,284
This is where the Kodek stone
enters the history books.

463
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:56,453
This is all getting to be
a bit unreal.

464
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:59,523
Not for the ancient
Egyptians, it wasn't.

465
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:02,058
The Kodek stone
was very real to them.

466
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,495
It meant to hold great power,

467
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,663
mystical power.

468
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,765
And you believe that crap?

469
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,901
Not at all.

470
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:12,702
But, I do believe
this is the tomb

471
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,105
Behar spent
his life looking for.

472
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,441
Let's get moving, people.

473
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,024
Okay, I'm starting
to feel that we're lost.

474
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,426
We're not lost, Greg.

475
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,495
We're discovering.

476
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,271
Greg. - Yeah?

477
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,874
Keep an eye on Wells.

478
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:52,976
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

479
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:54,498
- Okay.
- Good.

480
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,595
Carl?

481
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:12,762
Are you there?

482
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:13,096
<i>Always.</i>

483
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:16,066
<i>Until you get that stone,</i>
<i>you're stuck with me.</i>

484
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,934
I wanna show you something.

485
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,470
Something I didn't
share with the others.

486
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,006
<i>I saved all the images</i>
<i>from earlier.</i>

487
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:25,508
<i>I had a few experts</i>
<i>look them over</i>

488
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,477
<i>and they all agree with you.</i>

489
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:31,715
<i>About the talisman keeping</i>
<i>Neferu in the tomb.</i>

490
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:35,885
Yeah, well you didn't get
to see everything earlier.

491
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,354
<i>Are you keeping secrets</i>
<i>from me, Jack?</i>

492
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:41,324
I didn't think you'd want me sharing
this with the rest of the group.

493
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,765
<i>I, I don't see anything.</i>

494
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,401
'Cause you're not
looking close enough.

495
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:54,037
The others missed it
in their excitement.

496
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:54,871
<i>What does it say, Jack?</i>

497
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:58,942
Talks about a passageway
in the heart of the tomb.

498
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:02,145
And, and it's unclear.

499
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:03,880
Can't make it out.

500
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,317
<i>Is it about the Kodek stone?</i>

501
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,552
Yes.

502
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:11,354
"The talisman,

503
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:16,293
"placed in the heart cavity
of the cursed king

504
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,530
"to keep him in
perpetual torment."

505
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,132
<i>And, that means...</i>

506
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:23,900
That means,
we find Neferu's mummy,

507
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:26,236
we find your goddamn stone.

508
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,806
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

509
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,375
Your guess is good as mine.

510
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,913
Son of a bitch.

511
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:40,216
They're taking my laptop, Jack.

512
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:42,419
Tell them to go.
- That equipment is...

513
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:43,053
Hey!

514
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:45,322
She will come with us!

515
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,157
Not so fast, asshole.

516
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,292
Jack! -We need that
equipment, Wells.

517
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:51,628
Fuck your equipment, Cooper.

518
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,967
So much for mentioning
Naseem's name.

519
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:58,668
I thought you knew him!

520
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,073
<i>I do and I can assure you</i>
<i>that we'll be having words.</i>

521
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:03,807
Words?

522
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:05,942
You better have
more than words, Carl.

523
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,711
<i>If I didn't</i>
<i>know you better, Jack,</i>

524
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:10,146
<i>I'd think you had feelings</i>
<i>for the girl.</i>

525
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:12,782
Shit! Your little bitch
is quite a handful.

526
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,584
I told you to let her go.

527
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:15,552
She shot my man!

528
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:17,354
Can't say I blame her.

529
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,155
Jack, just shoot him.

530
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,558
- Shut up.

531
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,018
So, are we gonna tell someone?

532
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,577
What are you doing?

533
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,713
I think it would be wise
if we left camp.

534
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:19,048
What are you
talking about, Coop?

535
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,317
It's Cooper. Dr. Cooper.

536
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:23,520
Oh, okay. I'll ask again.

537
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:25,989
What the fuck do you mean,
Cooper?

538
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:27,991
Decided we're leaving
and we will return

539
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:29,426
when things around here
are safer for us

540
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:30,560
to continue our work.

541
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:32,128
- Unacceptable.
- Safer?

542
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:32,996
Cooper, this is the
Middle East.

543
00:40:32,998 --> 00:40:35,565
When exactly do you think things are
ever gonna be safer around here?

544
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:37,600
We all discussed it.
It's for the best.

545
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,202
Well, nobody
discussed it with me.

546
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:43,072
I didn't think it was necessary
to discuss it with you, Wells.

547
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:44,941
Tell me you are not
okay with this.

548
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,010
Hey, I'm just the hired help.

549
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:47,644
I follow the money.

550
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:50,547
Load the rest of the gear
up on the jeep.

551
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:51,347
Shit.

552
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:52,916
We're not going anywhere.

553
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:54,918
Some son of a bitch
just cut the...

554
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,587
What was that?

555
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,355
Hassan!

556
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,492
Wait for us, Wells.

557
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:03,893
Radio for help.

558
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,129
We don't have time to wait.

559
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,499
<i>Jack, talk to me.</i>

560
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,935
<i>What the hell is</i>
<i>going on there?</i>

561
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,513
Shit!

562
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,420
Kate!

563
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,332
It's not deep.
It looks worse than it is.

564
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,000
Can you stand?

565
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,170
Yeah, I'll be all right.

566
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,874
Dr. Cooper?

567
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:54,177
Dr. Cooper.

568
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:57,046
The radios, they...

569
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,048
Slow down, kid.

570
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,884
Try and breathe.

571
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,519
You okay?

572
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:06,089
The radios and satellite
phones are trashed.

573
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:08,992
So,

574
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:09,993
we're fucked.

575
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:11,995
- Shit.

576
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,663
Jack!

577
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,834
- What was that?

578
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:27,243
Oh, my God, get in here!

579
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,847
Oh, my God, Wells!

580
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,591
Dr. Cooper.

581
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:42,425
<i>Jack.</i>

582
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:45,795
Dr. Wells.
<i>- Jack... You still there?</i>

583
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,865
Where's Marty?

584
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:50,466
<i>Jack?</i>

585
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,803
He's over here.

586
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,139
He's trapped.

587
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,941
His hand is stuck.

588
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,475
Looks bad.

589
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:02,812
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- We gotta get him out.

590
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,750
<i>I can have a rescue team</i>
<i>to you in 12 hours.</i>

591
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,919
<i>Just get the stone first.</i>

592
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:16,960
Let me take a look.

593
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:18,895
So now you're a medical doctor?

594
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:20,063
I'm just trying to help.

595
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:22,398
You know, it's okay to pull
that stick out of your ass

596
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,567
every once in a while, Cooper.

597
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,336
Fine.

598
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,607
This does not look good.

599
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:34,177
What are we gonna do?

600
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:37,780
We're gonna get him free,
then we're gonna find Kate.

601
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:38,214
Kate?

602
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:41,684
Seems like we have more pressing
issues than finding Kate.

603
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:42,552
Stop. - What?

604
00:43:42,554 --> 00:43:45,955
You're gonna bring the whole
place down on our heads.

605
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,124
We can't leave Marty.

606
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,993
We're not leaving anyone.

607
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,198
What are you doing?

608
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,333
I'm gonna try to pull him free.

609
00:43:57,534 --> 00:43:58,401
Are you insane?

610
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:01,871
This whole place is gonna
come down any moment now.

611
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:06,542
We gotta get you out of here.

612
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,745
Don't.

613
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,214
I'm not gonna lie to you,
it's gonna hurt.

614
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:13,516
A hell lot of a worse before
it gets any better.

615
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:15,018
Shit. How bad?

616
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,454
Bad, kid. Pretty fucking bad.

617
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,156
Give me your wallet, Coop.

618
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,659
My wallet? What do you
want with my wallet?

619
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:24,694
Just give him your
fucking wallet!

620
00:44:24,696 --> 00:44:26,396
I don't give a shit
if he wants a tip.

621
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:28,865
Just get me
the fuck out of here.

622
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:33,403
You might wanna
bite down on this.

623
00:44:33,405 --> 00:44:34,437
Why?

624
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:37,040
It's better than
biting your tongue off.

625
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,345
This is not gonna be fun, kid.

626
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:45,982
Don't, don't tell me
about it, just do it.

627
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,720
Greg, on three.

628
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:52,655
You got that, Coop?

629
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,291
One,

630
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:56,626
two,

631
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:57,660
three!

632
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:09,072
Any news on that rescue team?

633
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:09,672
<i>Any news on my stone?</i>

634
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:12,642
You'll get your fucking stone
as soon as I know Kate is safe.

635
00:45:12,644 --> 00:45:14,577
But, I wanna know
that team is on its way.

636
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:15,244
<i>I'll make the call.</i>

637
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:18,381
<i>Think of it as a</i>
<i>gesture of goodwill.</i>

638
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,083
One of these days, Carl,

639
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:21,050
I'm gonna kill you.

640
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,953
<i>Join the line, Jack,</i>
<i>join the line.</i>

641
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:25,855
Is he ready to move?

642
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:27,924
He's lost a lot of blood.

643
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,559
I know.

644
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:31,294
But, is he ready?

645
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,663
I'm ready.

646
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:34,897
Can you stand up?

647
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,200
- Yeah.
- Okay.

648
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:39,035
Let's get you up.

649
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,010
What now?

650
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:49,278
Our options are pretty limited,

651
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,314
but I suggest we get moving.

652
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,719
You know, I said we should
have left.

653
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:32,355
If we had, we wouldn't
be in this situation.

654
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:35,458
Yeah, and Marty would still
have two arms.

655
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,527
We can't change that either.

656
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:41,130
I told them we should've
hired someone else.

657
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:44,700
Don't try putting this shit
on me, Cooper.

658
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:48,938
It's okay, buddy, we're
gonna get you out of here.

659
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:53,009
Your act doesn't fool anyone,
Wells.

660
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:54,143
What fucking act?

661
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:57,680
We all know about your past.
Me better than most.

662
00:46:57,682 --> 00:46:59,782
Or have you forgotten about
Abu Rawash?

663
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:03,419
That has nothing to do
with what's happening here.

664
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:05,121
You sure about that?

665
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:08,958
I'm sure the Kodek stone is
a huge temptation for you.

666
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,060
We'll finish this later,
Cooper.

667
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:13,930
But, right now,
Kate is the priority.

668
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:17,667
<i>And the stone, Jack.</i>
<i>Don't forget the stone.</i>

669
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:20,603
Fuck you and fuck your stone.

670
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,925
It all looks the same.

671
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:47,296
Is there water in that canteen?

672
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:48,631
Some.

673
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:49,465
Give it to me.

674
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:52,001
Stop complaining, Cooper.

675
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,739
Wells, Wells, wait.

676
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:59,542
We need to rest.

677
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,845
Marty doesn't look very good.

678
00:48:10,187 --> 00:48:11,587
Marty?

679
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,460
So thirsty.

680
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:19,762
Can't breathe.

681
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:23,032
How much water you got left?

682
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:24,267
Why?

683
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:25,001
It's my water.

684
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:27,737
Whatever you got,
you give half to Marty.

685
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:29,805
Get him comfortable.

686
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:32,308
And, if Cooper holds out
on the water,

687
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:33,809
you punch him in the face.

688
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:38,080
I'm gonna scout ahead and see if I
can get some bearings on a way out.

689
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:41,350
Wait. Hey, wait!

690
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:43,252
You'll be back, right?

691
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,254
Half an hour, tops.

692
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,909
<i>I was wondering when you</i>
<i>were going to dump</i>

693
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:08,477
<i>that dead weight.</i>

694
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,946
Well, I might be lying to them,

695
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:12,181
but I have no intention
of dumping them.

696
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:13,316
<i>So what's the plan?</i>

697
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:14,717
I've been walking
them in a circle

698
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:16,585
for the last 15 minutes.

699
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:17,753
<i>Why?</i>

700
00:49:17,755 --> 00:49:21,891
Because I saw something that I
wanted to take a closer look at.

701
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:28,297
<i>What is it, Jack?</i>

702
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,467
It's interesting.

703
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,269
<i>Talk to me, Jack.</i>

704
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:34,937
It's a coded map.

705
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:36,005
<i>On where?</i>

706
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:38,374
<i>- To find the stone?</i>
- Yeah.

707
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:41,243
And how to get the fuck
out of here.

708
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:43,879
Looks like

709
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:46,449
you have to go through the
burial chamber

710
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:48,351
before we'll find

711
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,186
the exit.

712
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:53,622
Shit.

713
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,520
- Shit!

714
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,555
Thank God, it's you.

715
00:50:33,797 --> 00:50:35,197
He's back.

716
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:37,867
Wells?

717
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,301
Yeah, it's me.

718
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:41,070
And I brought a friend.

719
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,506
- Hey.
- Hey.

720
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,808
Tell me you found a way out.

721
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,942
I might've.

722
00:50:46,944 --> 00:50:49,578
You might have?
What the hell does that mean?

723
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,647
I found more writing.

724
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:55,418
It looks like the slaves planned
an escape at some point.

725
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,087
And they mapped
the structure out in code.

726
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:01,557
It tells how we must go
through the heart of the tomb,

727
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:02,892
to reach salvation.

728
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:03,459
The heart?

729
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,795
I think it's talking about
the burial chamber.

730
00:51:05,797 --> 00:51:08,264
I know what it means, Wells.

731
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:10,166
Christ, that means we have to
go deeper.

732
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:11,667
It's the best chance
we've got right now.

733
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:13,936
Unless you wanna wander
around here aimlessly

734
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:15,905
until we run out of water.

735
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,774
Shit.

736
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,913
How you doing, kid?

737
00:51:23,915 --> 00:51:26,182
Stopped wanting to vomit.

738
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:27,550
That's a plus.

739
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,588
You ready to make a move?

740
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:34,757
Kate has something to show us.

741
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:37,159
Shortcut to the exit, I hope.

742
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:39,728
No, but I think I found Behar.

743
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,545
Or at least what's left of him.

744
00:51:56,547 --> 00:51:58,180
Oh, my God.

745
00:51:58,182 --> 00:51:59,815
What happened to him?

746
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:01,650
Poor guy.

747
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:04,720
Had to guess, I'd say
Hassan happened to him.

748
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:06,989
You'll be okay for a minute?

749
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:08,257
Yeah.

750
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,392
His heart's gone.

751
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:11,127
Yeah.

752
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:14,563
Whatever took his heart had
his brain at the same time.

753
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:18,667
<i>What if he explored the tomb</i>
<i>before he made the video?</i>

754
00:52:18,669 --> 00:52:20,636
<i>He may have the stone.</i>

755
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:23,239
If this was Hassan's handiwork,

756
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:25,508
he is one sick bastard.

757
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:29,645
What are you looking for?

758
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,748
I'm looking for anything
that might help us.

759
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,251
Now, this is more like it.

760
00:52:35,253 --> 00:52:37,620
<i>- The stone?</i>
- Dynamite.

761
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,523
What if Behar did enter
the tomb?

762
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:51,460
What if he had,
it changed nothing.

763
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:54,463
He'd still be dead,
we'd still be trapped.

764
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,365
What if he found the stone?

765
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:59,435
What, and Neferu wants it back?

766
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:04,673
Just listen for a minute,
will you?

767
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:06,542
What if he found the stone

768
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:08,811
and Hassan killed him for it?

769
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,781
For a man who has no interest
in the Kodek stone,

770
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:14,984
you talk about it quite a lot.

771
00:54:14,986 --> 00:54:17,953
That's because our lives
might depend on it.

772
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,994
Canopic jars.

773
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:26,729
We must be close.

774
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:28,597
It's an antechamber.

775
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:36,171
<i>What's going on, Jack?</i>
<i>I'm still blind on this end.</i>

776
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:39,675
<i>And you haven't spoken</i>
<i>for over an hour.</i>

777
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,321
Careful!

778
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,029
It's empty.

779
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:03,232
Supposedly, Siptah had
Neferu's organs destroyed,

780
00:55:03,234 --> 00:55:05,434
so he couldn't
take them to the afterlife.

781
00:55:05,436 --> 00:55:09,004
The jars that you are
about to drop...

782
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,941
Were left as a further insult.

783
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:15,411
Can you feel that?

784
00:55:15,413 --> 00:55:17,046
Feel what?

785
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:18,981
It's fresh air.

786
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:21,450
It's faint, but I can feel it.

787
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,291
I feel it.

788
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,894
Fresh air means
a way out, right?

789
00:55:31,896 --> 00:55:33,295
Maybe.

790
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:36,165
Hey, guys.

791
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,400
Over here.

792
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:45,641
There's an opening.

793
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,250
There's another chamber
on the far side,

794
00:55:55,252 --> 00:55:56,785
larger than this one.

795
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:58,487
What about the air?

796
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,690
It's definitely breezy.

797
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:43,298
Looks safe enough.

798
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,738
- It's in and out, Kate.
- All you gotta do is breathe.

799
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,508
And you'll be waiting
for me on the other side?

800
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:54,943
You want me to go first?

801
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:57,045
You promise to follow?

802
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,448
I'll make sure she does.

803
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:02,851
And you're okay
bringing up the rear?

804
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:05,154
It's better I go last.

805
00:57:05,156 --> 00:57:07,356
You don't want me collapsing
halfway through

806
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:08,590
and blocking up the passage.

807
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:11,427
Don't even joke
about it, Marty.

808
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:13,929
Come on, guys!

809
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:17,866
Just remember, breathe.

810
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,702
Come on, Doc. It's easy.

811
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:23,038
No more than 30 feet, Kate.

812
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,406
Just keep moving.

813
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:25,073
<i>What's going on, Jack?</i>

814
00:57:25,075 --> 00:57:27,943
I'm trying to
get out of this mess alive.

815
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:30,179
<i>What are you doing, Jack?</i>

816
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:35,551
<i>I mean it, Jack.</i>
<i>No stone, no rescue team.</i>

817
00:57:35,553 --> 00:57:36,351
If I get out of here,

818
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:39,488
you're gonna need a rescue
team after I hunt you down.

819
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:44,293
<i>I'm harder to find</i>
<i>than you think.</i>

820
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,462
Rochester Hotel, 336.

821
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:49,097
You're not the only one
with resources, Carl.

822
00:57:49,099 --> 00:57:51,033
We're almost there, Doc.

823
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:52,401
Come on!

824
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:55,304
- Okay, Kate.
- Just close your eyes.

825
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:57,272
Feel your way along.
Nothing to it.

826
00:57:57,274 --> 00:58:00,209
That's easy for you to say.

827
00:58:02,446 --> 00:58:05,180
I'm going as fast as I can.

828
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:06,915
Almost there.

829
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,852
You're full of shit, Jack.

830
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,289
Shit!

831
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,059
Jack?

832
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:19,161
- Come on, Kate, 6 feet!

833
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:21,997
I can't.

834
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,334
- Wells.
- Fuck off, Coop.

835
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,069
Kate?

836
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:28,203
I can't.

837
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:30,105
Fucking look at me!

838
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:32,040
Now, follow me.

839
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,521
You still there, Marty?

840
00:58:45,523 --> 00:58:48,290
Get me out of here, Dr. Wells!

841
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:51,026
Now, I need you to
hold on there, Marty.

842
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,961
I don't wanna be left
down here,

843
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:54,463
not alone,

844
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:54,963
not to die.

845
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:56,832
Don't you even think
about that, Marty.

846
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:57,533
I'm getting you out of here,

847
00:58:57,535 --> 00:59:00,736
and we're gonna get you
a new arm, you hear me?

848
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:03,972
I've got a friend whose gonna get
you the best arm money can buy.

849
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:06,742
- His name's Carl.
<i>- Not funny, Jack.</i>

850
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,411
I don't like it down here,
Dr. Wells.

851
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:10,078
I'm scared.

852
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,447
You call me Dr. Wells again
and I'll stop digging.

853
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:13,815
The name is Jack.

854
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:15,384
You call me Jack.

855
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,686
Just get me out of here!

856
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:22,157
You guys, quiet a minute.

857
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:23,091
What is it?

858
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:25,727
I don't know,
didn't you hear it?

859
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:31,466
Marty? - Did you hear that?

860
00:59:31,468 --> 00:59:33,135
Yeah, we heard it.

861
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:37,839
I need you to try to get to us,

862
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:39,041
can you do that, Marty?

863
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:41,109
Yeah, I'll do my best.

864
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:45,380
I just wanna go home.

865
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:47,282
You and me both.

866
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,384
I don't wanna die!

867
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:50,185
Marty!

868
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:54,156
Marty!

869
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,600
You see anything?

870
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,371
This fucking coward.

871
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:14,343
Hassan, you son of a bitch.

872
01:00:14,345 --> 01:00:16,244
I'm not so sure
that was Hassan.

873
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:17,980
Who else could it have been?

874
01:00:17,982 --> 01:00:19,247
I mean, I lost him in the cave

875
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:21,984
and we all saw what
he was about to do to Marty.

876
01:00:21,986 --> 01:00:24,052
Yeah, but that doesn't
convince me

877
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:26,254
that it was Hassan
with Marty this time.

878
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:28,223
Who was it then, Wells?

879
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,459
Neferu?

880
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,029
Oh, no, go on, tell us.

881
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:36,131
If it wasn't Hassan,
who was it?

882
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:37,933
I don't know.

883
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:39,635
I didn't see it clearly.

884
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:41,770
But it moved too fast to be...

885
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:43,572
To be what?

886
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,741
To be human.

887
01:00:47,611 --> 01:00:49,378
That's ridiculous.

888
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,980
Do you see that light?

889
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,382
Oh, shit.

890
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,184
What is it?

891
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,154
I think we just found...

892
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:34,389
The burial chamber.

893
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:19,067
It's definitely
not what I expected.

894
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,370
Neferu wasn't treated
as a king.

895
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:25,373
His brother wanted
death to be an insult.

896
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,322
What are you doing, Wells?

897
01:02:40,324 --> 01:02:43,091
What you brought
me along to do, Coop.

898
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,860
Decipher.

899
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:48,730
What does it say?

900
01:02:48,732 --> 01:02:53,168
"Neferu's soul
is held within the stone,

901
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:55,437
"and the stone within,

902
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:57,005
"Neferu."

903
01:02:57,673 --> 01:02:59,775
What the hell does it mean?

904
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:01,309
I don't know.

905
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:04,412
Shh.

906
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:06,348
Do you guys hear that?

907
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:19,127
I'll keep my eye out.

908
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:26,268
So,

909
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:29,004
you wanna open it?

910
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:32,741
You ready?

911
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,610
Yeah.

912
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:36,978
Yeah.

913
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,480
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

914
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:39,848
Okay.

915
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,354
Lift.

916
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:00,035
Oh, fuck.

917
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,142
Where the hell is Neferu?

918
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,912
<i>Did you find the stone?</i>

919
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:11,746
It's not here.

920
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:13,481
What's not in here?

921
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:15,116
The diamond?

922
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,855
I know you're only here
for that stone.

923
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:23,158
You've been lying to us
the whole time.

924
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,794
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

925
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:27,429
Jack?

926
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:28,597
Is that true?

927
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:30,298
We're all getting paid
to do a job.

928
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,234
I'm just getting paid twice.

929
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:33,768
You son of a bitch.

930
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,805
I knew I never should
have brought you along.

931
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:38,740
If we're gonna get out
of this mess,

932
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:40,822
we're gonna have to
do it together.

933
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:17,879
No! Help!

934
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,171
Are you okay?

935
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:17,472
<i>What the hell is going on,</i>
<i>Jack?</i>

936
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:20,342
Yeah, good news is,
I found your stone.

937
01:06:20,344 --> 01:06:21,977
Bad news is,
it just walked away.

938
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:23,845
We gotta get out of here.

939
01:06:23,847 --> 01:06:25,180
You will.

940
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:27,916
Jack?

941
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:28,984
Find a way out.

942
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:31,286
There's rescue team on the way.

943
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,823
What about you?

944
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:36,358
I'm going back for Cooper.

945
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,959
<i>What about my stone?</i>

946
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:39,828
I'm coming with you.

947
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:42,931
Just find the exit.
I'll be right behind you.

948
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,073
- Now go.

949
01:06:57,913 --> 01:06:58,713
Go!

950
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:03,084
<i>What's your plan, Jack?</i>

951
01:07:03,086 --> 01:07:04,919
I haven't got one.

952
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:44,786
<i>Jack?</i>

953
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:47,555
<i>What's going on?</i>

954
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:50,992
<i>Talk to me, Jack.</i>

955
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,861
Please don't do this.

956
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:29,864
I am sorry.

957
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,667
It is his will.

958
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,645
No!

959
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:53,087
It is done, My King.

960
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,324
<i>Jack, wake up,</i>
<i>you son of a bitch...</i>

961
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,274
Oh, Jesus Christ.

962
01:10:46,276 --> 01:10:49,577
<i>Shit, Jack,</i>
<i>I'm glad to hear your voice.</i>

963
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,679
You might change your mind,

964
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:53,781
when I tell you
my fee just went up.

965
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:57,452
<i>Well, it's a bit late in
the game for negotiating.</i>

966
01:10:57,454 --> 01:10:58,486
Oh, yeah?

967
01:10:58,488 --> 01:11:04,492
Well, I charge extra when
a cursed mummy is involved.

968
01:11:04,494 --> 01:11:05,226
<i>Jack?</i>

969
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:08,529
- <i> Jack?</i>

970
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,599
Dr. Wells,

971
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,702
you should've left
when you had the chance.

972
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:15,837
Untie me

973
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:18,139
- and I'll leave right now.
- No!

974
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:21,009
It's too late for that.

975
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:24,646
Neferu must take
what was taken from him.

976
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:28,283
You help him kill?

977
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:30,518
His hold on me is too strong.

978
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,855
And with each victim,
he grows stronger.

979
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:36,491
How many, Hassan?

980
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:37,692
How many before us?

981
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:41,262
Not enough to quench
the King's hunger.

982
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:44,899
Maybe, one day,

983
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,567
he will sleep again.

984
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:50,071
- Until that day comes...

985
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,073
I must serve him.

986
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:56,377
I wish you safe travels
into the next life.

987
01:11:56,379 --> 01:11:57,879
Doctor...

988
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:14,228
Kate.

989
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:15,730
I told you to get out of here.

990
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:18,232
I bet you're glad
I didn't listen.

991
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,811
We have to get
the fuck out of here

992
01:12:29,813 --> 01:12:31,512
before Neferu comes back.

993
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:32,647
It must be a trick,

994
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:34,749
being alive defies any logic.

995
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:35,750
He's not alive, Kate,

996
01:12:35,752 --> 01:12:37,518
- he's hungry.
- Shit!

997
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:52,900
Oh, fuck.

998
01:12:54,269 --> 01:12:55,503
Run!

999
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:05,213
Shh.

1000
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:28,503
So, where's this way out
you were talking about?

1001
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:30,271
This way.

1002
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:56,998
There it is.

1003
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:12,580
<i>The rescue team should be with
you in the next two hours.</i>

1004
01:14:12,582 --> 01:14:15,183
They better be here
in two minutes.

1005
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:25,259
Down, Jack! Duck!

1006
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:28,830
Keep digging.

1007
01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:31,432
Whatever happens,
just keep digging.

1008
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:55,890
Time to go nighty night,
asshole.

1009
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,877
Jack?

1010
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:18,346
- Jack!

1011
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:27,522
The Kodek stone.

1012
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:29,257
Beautiful isn't it?

1013
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:30,758
It's amazing.

1014
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:31,726
Isn't it?

1015
01:15:31,728 --> 01:15:33,094
<i>Yes, it's stunning.</i>

1016
01:15:33,096 --> 01:15:35,563
Neferu. Do you think
he's still around?

1017
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:38,466
I'm not gonna stick around
to find out.

1018
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:42,103
But, just in case he is...

1019
01:15:42,105 --> 01:15:43,905
<i>- What are you doing, Jack?</i>
- What are you doing?

1020
01:15:43,907 --> 01:15:46,240
Keep it! <i> -You can't do that.</i>

1021
01:15:46,242 --> 01:15:48,342
<i>You, you son of a bitch.</i>

1022
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:49,777
<i>You're ruined,</i>

1023
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:53,080
<i>I'm gonna see to it,</i>
<i>Jack Wells.</i>

1024
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:55,049
Fuck you, Carl.

1025
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,181
Name.

1026
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:03,985
Carl Rosencane.

1027
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:05,519
Profession.

1028
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:08,723
A little this, a little that.

1029
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:11,792
Do you own ItraCorp Intel,
Mr. Rosencane?

1030
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:15,796
Oh, that's among many
of the things that I own.

1031
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:17,298
I'll take that as a yes.

1032
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,833
Take it as you will.

1033
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:21,902
But make this as quick
as possible.

1034
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:24,071
Have you had any dealings
with the Egyptian government

1035
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:25,940
as of late, Mr. Rosencane?

1036
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:28,442
I have many dealings
with many governments.

1037
01:17:28,444 --> 01:17:30,745
Would you care to elaborate?

1038
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:31,846
Are you aware of the
disappearance

1039
01:17:31,848 --> 01:17:34,315
of an archeological team
outside of Hijaza?

1040
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:38,853
Dr. Jeremy Cooper,

1041
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:40,021
Dr. Jack Wells,

1042
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:42,390
Kate Alvarez, Marty Timor,

1043
01:17:42,392 --> 01:17:43,758
Greg Baptiste.

1044
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:44,892
We've been informed that

1045
01:17:44,894 --> 01:17:47,762
you may have participated
in their disappearance.

1046
01:17:47,764 --> 01:17:50,865
I'd love to know where
you get your information.

1047
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:54,101
Our sources are none of your
concern, Mr. Rosencane.

1048
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:58,539
What is of our concern is the
disappearance of five American citizens

1049
01:17:58,541 --> 01:18:01,142
and the involvement
that ItraCorp Intel

1050
01:18:01,144 --> 01:18:03,544
might have played
in said disappearance.

1051
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:07,014
ItraCorp Intel is a
legitimate company.

1052
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:10,551
I have nothing to do
with anybody's disappearance.

1053
01:18:10,553 --> 01:18:15,156
To believe otherwise
would be absolutely ludicrous.

1054
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:17,458
