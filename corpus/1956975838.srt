[From Car] Hey nice coconuts.

175
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:31,848
Oh, thank you sir, thank you.
Oh my goodness.

176
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:36,244
Hello, it's my money time.
Hello.

177
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,208
AAAHHH! AAAHHH! OHHHH NOOOOO!

178
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:48,822
Ugh, who knew this
would be so hard?

179
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:50,824
That costume stunk, too.

180
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:53,827
I can't believe you got fired.

181
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,221
I know.
How was I supposed to know that the sprinklers were going to go off

182
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:59,876
and that the suit couldn't get
wet. I didn't know.

183
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,488
Well that's why it smelled.
It's never been washed.

184
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:05,752
[Sigh] Can it get any worse?

185
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:10,670
I don't think so.
I just got fired from a job where I wore a gigantic gorilla costume

186
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:14,543
and waved a banana at
cars passing by.

187
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:20,027
I... [laughing]

188
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:28,165
Just wait here a moment

189
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:29,601
Okay.

190
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,955
I don't think she's for us.

191
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:36,434
Why not?

192
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,175
Recognize her?

193
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:44,486
Uh, so. She's cleaning. How
hard is that?

194
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:51,014
I don't want the customers to be uncomfortable
thinking that she might steal from them.

195
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:59,066
She'll be out of sight and she's got to be pretty desperate.

196
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:04,332
Alright. We'll give her a chance,
but you keep your eye on her.

197
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:08,728
Hi.

198
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,468
Hi. Any luck?

199
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:13,689
I don't know if you call it
luck but I got a job.

200
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:18,389
I am now the new custodial technician at the spa on Main Street.

201
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,217
Custodial Technician?

202
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:21,479
[Clears throat] Janitor.

203
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:23,394
Sounds lovely.

204
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:26,223
Yeah, but I think it's going to be enough to cover our expenses.

205
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,573
I'm just worried about
Margarett's medicine.

206
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:34,666
Well, my options were fast food, which pays nothing,
or a grocery bagger that pays even less.

207
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:39,236
I was really starting to give up,
but I checked the internet one more time

208
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,456
and you are now looking at the new copy assistant to a marketing firm.

209
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:45,068
You're kidding! That's
amazing. How did you do that?

210
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:50,465
Well, I think you'd
do great here.

211
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:53,729
Can you start Monday, Ms. Webb?

212
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,472
I think he thought I was cute.

213
00:12:57,515 --> 00:13:00,040
Wait, so are there any other
jobs available?

214
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:03,391
No, but um, I should be
bringing in enough to cover us.

215
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:06,437
Okay, well, we still
need to be frugal.

216
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:09,179
Yeah, how am I going
to get to work?

217
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:14,097
Ugh, the bus is stinky and always running late.
We need a car.

218
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:18,145
Well, I could actually walk to the spa from here,
but a car would come in handy.

219
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:19,537
I'll start looking for
something cheap.

220
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:22,062
Something nice.

221
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,715
Of course.

222
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:26,457
Alright, well, I gotta get ready
I'm going to dinner with John.

223
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:28,459
John? I haven't heard
about him in a while.

224
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,722
I think he was worried about
the job that dad got him,

225
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:33,116
but he sounded happy so it must
still be going through.

226
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,335
Good. Have fun.

227
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:35,771
Thanks!

228
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:43,213
Ai yie yie. How are we going to
be able to afford a car?

229
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,133
Have you heard from
your dad recently?

230
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:54,485
Um, my mom's talked to him.
She fills us in.

231
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:55,617
Hmm.

232
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,706
It's been really hard
on everybody.

233
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:02,015
I mean my poor mom she just
didn't see that coming at all.

234
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:05,496
She could really use some good
news right about now.

235
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,716
Well, I have some.

236
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,456
Really?

237
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:10,197
The Switzerland job.

238
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:12,895
I thought they were going to dump me after your dad was arrested,

239
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,202
but they're flying me out
to start the job.

240
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:17,595
That's great!

241
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,644
Yeah, I'm going out there to get trained,
start workin', and I will get to explore Switzerland.

242
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:25,168
So, when do you leave?

243
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:26,735
This week.

244
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:30,434
Ohh, and any idea on when
you're going to return?

245
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:35,352
I don't know. I mean, no exact dates yet,
but the plan is to get started,

246
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:38,834
and then transfer me to one
of the offices here in the US.

247
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,662
Oh, good.

248
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:45,580
Hey, I'll miss you.

249
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,451
I'll miss you, too.

250
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,453
I'll call you every day.

251
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,542
[Sigh]

252
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:03,903
Guess what? I got us a car,
actually it's a truck.

253
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,730
What happened to our TV?

254
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:08,690
Yes, I had to pay for the
truck, somehow.

255
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:12,694
Listen, it's not what we're used to, but,
it's going to get us from a to b.

256
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:18,091
Come look, come. You're gonna
love this. Come on.

257
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:24,488
Well, it can get us from point a to point b,
but can it get us back to point a?

258
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:28,536
My friend gave me a great deal 'cause her dad doesn't need it anymore.

259
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:30,886
[Sigh] I already miss
the flat screen.

260
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,238
No, need. I got us a
replacement.

261
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:36,718
This keeps getting
better and better.

262
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:41,375
Doesn't it? So what happened on
your date last night?

263
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:44,856
Nothing. Well, something. The
job came through in Switzerland.

264
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,770
Oh good.

265
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:46,946
He leaves right away.

266
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:49,122
Oh bad.

267
00:15:50,253 --> 00:15:54,475
Well, do you wanna take
it for a spin?

268
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:58,261
Honestly, no.

269
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:00,307
Yeah.

270
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,659
All right so here's where we
keep all of the fresh linens.

271
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:07,705
We have sheets here, towels here.
Everything's organized by size

272
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:09,838
so it's face, hand, and body.

273
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:12,058
Got it.

274
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:15,191
Um so, each customer's going to get a set in
their locker when they come in and so you

275
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,715
need to refill the lockers
as each customer leaves.

276
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,676
Also, put extra towels
in each treatment room.

277
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,808
Okay, I think I can handle that.

278
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:27,856
Okay good, ummm and
your uniform.

279
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:29,466
Uniform?

280
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,294
Yeah.

281
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:33,905
Great.

282
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,176
How's the work going?

283
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:45,569
Oh, it's fine.

284
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:49,269
Uh, the bathrooms need a deep cleaning so you
can stay late one night this week and do that.

285
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:50,313
No problem.

286
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:09,637
I'm Hannah the office manager.
I'm not going to sugar coat it.

287
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,247
You've got a lot of work ahead
of you.

288
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:13,945
We come up with marketing campaigns for tons of accounts.

289
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:17,471
People will come to you throughout the day with presentations, contracts,

290
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:20,691
whatever to copy. And this will
be your domain.

291
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:23,825
Good luck with the machines,
but don't sweat it if you go through a few reams of paper

292
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:29,613
trying to figure it out.
Just be sure to log in the copy job with what client it goes for.

293
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:31,224
That way we can bill them.

294
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:31,963
Okay.

295
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,530
Big talker aren't ya?

296
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:34,836
Well, I was just wondering...

297
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:38,318
I'm at extension 377 if
you get in a panic.

298
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:53,768
Hi!

299
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,291
Oh, you're new here aren't you?

300
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:56,031
Yes.

301
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:01,515
I hope you can do this. I need 50 copies collated,
3 whole punched and bound.

302
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,040
Okay, don't use those coil things.
Brads or brackets will be fine. I will be back in a half an hour.

303
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,302
Okay.

304
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,479
Brads, brackets.

305
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:13,614
Okay.

306
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:15,398
[Sigh]

307
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,795
This goes there.

308
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,672
Uh, yeah, well that was easy.

309
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:35,940
Ugh, Come on. What did I do?
What is with you?

310
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:39,466
Don't stress. It's just a jam.

311
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:41,076
Thank you.

312
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,426
I'm Brandon. You must be the
new copy girl.

313
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,037
Yes, Marianne Da--,
Marianne um Webb.

314
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:47,865
I just need a copy

315
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:49,693
Okay, um.

316
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:50,607
I got it.

317
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:53,871
Wow, that was... easy.

318
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:59,312
I think the user manual's
on that shelf.

319
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,705
Really? Thank you!

320
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:03,316
Good luck.

321
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:13,891
Hey.

322
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,980
My hands are killing me.

323
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:17,939
Mmm, I'm sorry.

324
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:19,027
Mmm hmm.

325
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,984
Oh, you wanna use some of my
lotion?

326
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:22,552
Yeah, thanks.

327
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,641
Mmmm, I forgot how good this
one smells.

328
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:26,339
Hey I've come a long way.

329
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,645
Remember when I used to make those concoctions out of clovers?

330
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:31,735
[Laughing] Oh yeah, how could I
forget that?

331
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:33,998
Wow this already makes my hands
feel better.

332
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,391
Really?

333
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:36,827
Yeah, I'm not even just sayin'
that to be nice.

334
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:37,785
Can I keep this bottle?

335
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,526
Yeah, go for it.

336
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,789
How was your day?

337
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:44,531
It was stressful.
I mean who would have thought making copies could be so difficult?

338
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:46,141
What are you watching?

339
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,013
I have no idea. The reception
on this thing is terrible.

340
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:52,930
Well with all that tinfoil on the antenna I bet
you we could pick up a talk show from Mars.

341
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,671
[LAUGHTER]

342
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:59,198
We good? Okay.

343
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,677
Hey. I was just looking for you.

344
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:02,462
Oh.

345
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:04,507
Um, can you put together five packets from the file on this drive?

346
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:06,509
Oh. Uh, okay, when do you
need it by?

347
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:08,555
Um, after lunch. Is that
enough time?

348
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:09,425
Sure.

349
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:10,426
Great.

350
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:20,871
Be careful dear.
My arthritis is acting up so my feet are awfully tender.

351
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:22,525
Oh, ok.

352
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:26,442
Uh, excuse me. Sorry I couldn't
help but overhear. Try this.

353
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:27,356
What is it?

354
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,140
It's a lotion my sister makes.

355
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:30,577
Okay.

356
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,756
Ohhh that scent. What
is that ambrosia?

357
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:39,455
Uh, I don't know. It's fruit,
flowers, I'm not sure.

358
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:43,067
Mmm. Very refreshing. Thank you.

359
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,112
You're welcome.

360
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:50,510
Okay. Let's see.

00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:54,035
Alright. Okay.

Okay, bye.

00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:39,080
Hey, Hannah, um, I noticed a
type-o on one of the copies.

368
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:40,777
Print it anyway.

369
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:42,779
Are you sure? It's
pretty obvious.

370
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:46,696
Our people know what they are doing.
It might be a play on words.

371
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,003
Yeah, I'm just going to ask
Brandon. Double check.

372
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:53,094
It's for Brandon? Definitely.
Just print it. He's senior management.

your job is simple:

00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:01,189
copy, staple, hole punch.
Don't overstep.

376
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,597
Ooohhh, my feet.

377
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,033
Was there something wrong
with your pedicure?

378
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:21,905
Oh no. I feel like
I'm 20 again.

379
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:25,822
This dear girl gave me some lotion.
It's really easing the pain.

Oh? Well, that's good.

381
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:33,003
Do you know where I could find her?
The girl who was gathering the towels.

382
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:34,004
That girl?

383
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:35,658
Oh miss, miss.

00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:37,573
Oh hi. How are your feet?

385
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:39,880
Oh, they feel better then
they have in years.

386
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:42,839
I'm wondering if you have any
more of that magic lotion?

387
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:46,669
Oh and Betty,
she has terrible backaches because of her mattress

388
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:49,106
and her husband's too
cheap to replace it.

389
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,197
He always says what's not broke don't fix it,
but he's just a tight wad.

390
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:56,113
I think this lotion is just
what she needs.

391
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:59,203
But I, I don't make it my
sister does but-

Oh honey to feel like this,
I am willing to pay for her time and ingredients.

You talk to your sister and let
me know next week.

with your work.

She's been better. She is gonna
send Margarett to visit us.

Is everything okay?

411
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:42,856
Yeah, I think so.
I think she's just having a hard time at school, just kids.

412
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:45,380
Poor thing. Like she doesn't
have enough to worry about.

00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:51,342
Oh, I'm gonna go back to the spa.
I'm gonna pick up some extra hours, so don't wait up.

416
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:52,996
I won't.

Oh hey, uh, can I get a couple
more bottles of that lotion?

418
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,827
I just gave you a full bottle.

419
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:01,135
I know but there's this customer there who loves it.
She wants to buy some.

420
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:02,919
Really? Okay.

How, how does the fact that you are a lawyer make me feel better?

I just stopped by to pick up
some stuff from Fran's office.

Oh.

00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:23,260
And you are?

438
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:27,700
Yeah, I'm the uh new custodian.
I didn't think there was anyone here.

439
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:30,485
It's okay. It's not everyday I
get a live concert.

440
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:35,838
Yes, yes well you know I was just trying to prepare for my,
my career in reality television.

441
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:37,971
Mmm hmm.

442
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:39,712
Yeah, I thought I would start with uh
singing and then I would move onto dance

443
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:43,324
and then you know the survival
one I wanted to try and and

444
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:46,762
maybe the one where I can choose
my own husband would be good.

445
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:51,027
I'd vote for ya. Elinor?

446
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:52,376
Uh yeah.

447
00:25:54,204 --> 00:26:00,384
Um I should go back to work here.
I'm trying to impress my boss.

448
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:02,169
I could put in a good
word for ya.

449
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:07,043
Oh no no that's okay.
I'm, I need to earn my reputation.

450
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:16,966
Um, hey maybe we could keep the
singing thing between just you and me.

451
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:25,192
Yeah, of course.
Um but only until you're on TV 'cause after that I make no promises.

452
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,805

What do you think?

458
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,301
I think you have to make
some decisions.

459
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:52,959
The spa can only bring in so
much. You owe a lot of money.

460
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:57,572
Yes, thank you for stating
the obvious.

461
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:01,010
I don't suppose anybody
owes you money?

462
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,449
I did loan Lucy a twenty.

463
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:11,281
How did you get into
so much debt?

464
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:16,852
Oh you know start up costs,
bills, blaahh.

465
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:20,073
Maybe it's time to give it up.

466
00:27:20,116 --> 00:27:22,336
Shut down the spa? No.

467
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:26,645
You could move. Maybe some place cheaper.
Change your lifestyle.

468
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,472
Not an option.

470
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:33,434
You're losing more money
every month.

Getting second, third,
fourth notices of default on your loans.

472
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:41,224
What if I got another loan to
float the others?

473
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:43,313
That's just gonna
make it worse.

474
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:47,013
I mean how long before they threaten to take everything away?

475
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:51,539
[Sigh] Have they already
threatened that?

476
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:55,021
I'll figure something out.

477
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,198
Fine.

478
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:04,726
Oh, hey I was surprised to find someone working so late at the spa.

479
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,380
She was cleaning the
locker room.

480
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:09,165
Oh, that's Elinor. She didn't
give you any trouble did she?

481
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:12,560
No, not at all. She been
working for you long?

482
00:28:12,603 --> 00:28:16,477
No, our janitor just quit. Why
all the interest?

483
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,350
Not interest, curiosity.

484
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:24,093
Her father is that fraud,
Dashwood.

485
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:30,447
Ugh, I mean she's just a janitor so I
agreed to let her work for me but, woo.

486
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:32,972
How gracious of you.

487
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:42,459

nine hours ahead.

00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:07,354
Yeah, uh, I must have set
my watch wrong.

[Sigh] You poor thing.
So, how's it going?

00:29:11,314 --> 00:29:16,058
Good. It's good.
Everything's very Swiss.

How so?

00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:22,151
Uh, there's holey cheese
everywhere and, uh, yeah

499
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:24,937
it tastes a lot better than
the stuff we have here, there.

500
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,156
And, um, how's work going?

501
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,334
It's great.
It's great but it uh would be a lot better if we were together.

502
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:34,337
Well, you better hurry up and impress them so you can come home.

five million dollars to this company.

00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:19,252
Typical. Just do the bare minimum, right?
Just enough to get by. Never thinking.

515
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:23,691
I saw the mistake. I took it to my boss and she
told me that you would know what you're doing.

516
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,606
Wait, you saw this and
you let it go?

517
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:27,216
Well, why didn't you see it.

518
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,610
Had I seen it, I would
have fixed it!

519
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:32,439
Don't blame me because you
don't take pride in your work.

520
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:38,358
You know this is what I get.
This is what I get for expecting a copy girl to understand.

521
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:41,143
[Sigh]

522
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:48,150
Just go ahead and have a seat,
your pedicurist will be right with you.

523
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:49,325
Oh thank you.

524
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,677
Oh Elinor, uh, wash the bowl
first and then the step.

525
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:54,635
Thank you.

526
00:30:54,678 --> 00:30:57,333
Anything to make you go faster.

527
00:30:58,204 --> 00:30:58,682
Excuse me.

528
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:00,336
Yes, ma'am?

529
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,166
No, I meant her. Are you the one
that makes that special lotion?

530
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,734
Oh yeah, that's me. Well, it's
actually my sister.

531
00:31:06,777 --> 00:31:10,085
Oh, Mrs. Jennings could not
stop talking about it.

532
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:14,481
She's the biggest gossip,
but when I heard I figured I need to try some.

533
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:16,004
Do you have a bottle I can buy?

534
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:20,095
I do. I do, you know it's
actually for Mrs. Jennings,

535
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:22,706
but I don't think she comes in
until the end of this week.

536
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,056
Oh, I'd love it.

537
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,753
Okay, I'll go get you one.

538
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:27,842
Thank you.

539
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:34,327
Anything wrong?

540
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,720
Elinor's selling lotion.

541
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:39,723
Yeah, a customer came in
earlier asking about that today.

542
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:42,683
Let me know if any other
people are looking for it?

543
00:31:42,726 --> 00:31:45,599
Are you going to stop
her from selling it?

544
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:48,863
No. Not yet.

545
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:01,789
Well if it isn't
the midnight idol.

546
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:06,185
Oh yes, just one of my
many secret identities.

547
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:06,837
Mind if I sit?

548
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:08,448
No, please.

549
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:11,886
You on a break from work?

550
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,672
Yeah, the brownies
here are amazing.

551
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:18,371
[Laugh] I've never tried 'em.

552
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:20,547
We weren't properly introduced
the other night, Edward Farris.

553
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,420
Elinor Dashwood. Farris? You're
not by any chance related to-

554
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:26,422
Yeah, Fran is my sister.

555
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:27,336
Oohh.

556
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,469
Yeah, don't fault me for that.

557
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:33,560
Well, I won't hold your relatives against
you if you don't hold mine against me.

558
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:36,215
Oh, that's right. The
investment guy.

559
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:37,825
Yeah.

560
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,611
So, what're you doing?

561
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:45,267
I'm, um, I'm actually trying to
make ends meet.

562
00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:46,877
Looks intense.

563
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:50,229
Yeah, it's amazing the things
you just can't do without.

564
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:51,491
Like that brownie.

565
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:55,451
And groceries, and medicine.

566
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,279
Medicine?

567
00:32:57,323 --> 00:33:00,152
Um, not for me, for
my little sister.

568
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:02,371
Oh, what's wrong with her?

569
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:06,941
Um, she has a type of leukemia.
It's treatable but the medicine is really expensive.

570
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,249
Yeah, money's heartless that
way. You know take us lawyers.

571
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:12,599
Without a good one your life
could be destroyed.

572
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:15,819
Lawyers and doctors. What kind
of law do you practice?

573
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:18,648
Patent law, mostly with
corporations and stuff.

574
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:20,128
Ahh.

575
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:21,956
Yeah, that doesn't make me any
more likeable does it?

576
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,655
Well, I'll see if I can maybe
overlook it.

577
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:27,309
Good.

578
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:30,791
Hey.

579
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:32,619
Hey, dinner's almost ready.

580
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:34,490
Macaroni and cheese?

581
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:35,665
It's a budget meal.

582
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:38,581
Elinor, you and your
budget meals.

583
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:39,800
Are you okay?

584
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:43,369
Yeah I just, uh, I had a bad
day at work.

585
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:44,848
Already?

586
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:47,286
Mmm hmm. I don't really want to
talk about it though.

587
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:48,983
Are you sure?

588
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,681
Yeah, I just left John this whole long voicemail about it so.

589
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:54,597
Okay, so I've been going over
our budget...

590
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:56,947
Ugh.

591
00:33:56,991 --> 00:34:00,603
No, it's good news and bad news,
but the good news is we have enough to cover our expenses.

592
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:02,518
The bad news is we're way short
on Margarett's.

593
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:04,390
Do we really need to talk about
this right now?

594
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:06,218
I have an idea.

595
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:07,480
[Sigh] Okay what?

596
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,351
Your lotion.

597
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:10,831
What about it?

598
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:14,356
It does something to people and
the smell is amazing.

599
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,229
So, I don't know if it's the scent that just
makes people feel better or if there's

600
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:20,754
actually something in the lotion,
but those bottles you gave me the other day,

601
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:23,322
they're gone and not to the
people they were intended for.

602
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:24,279
Really?

603
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:25,759
Do you think we can make more?

604
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:32,505
Yeah, sure. I, um, just gonna
need some extra ingredients.

605
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:36,857
Let's see calendula, and
passion flowers, cream, fruit.

606
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,554
You should buy it in bulk.

607
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:39,990
Are you feeling okay?

608
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:41,470
Yes.

609
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:42,906
[Laugh] Okay, are you sure that
we can make this back?

610
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,779
I mean, I'm gonna raise the
price so yeah.

611
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:46,823
I get to go shopping!

612
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:47,911
Just for the ingredients.

613
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:49,913
Okay, all right. I'm on it.

614
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:51,132
Kay!

615
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:53,091
You can have the mac and
cheese without me.

616
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,267
Thanks.

617
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:26,341
Hi.

618
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:27,864
Hi.

619
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:32,913
Um, I came by to apologize.

620
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:36,090
I was upset yesterday,
obviously,

621
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:42,488
but even without the typo my proposal wasn't what the client wanted.

622
00:35:42,531 --> 00:35:49,886
But, what you said about me not taking pride in my work,
you're wrong.

623
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,542
I do take pride in my work, I
take too much actually.

624
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:58,634
That's why, uh,
that's why this is a little hard for me to swallow.

625
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,030
Okay.

626
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:08,340
Hmm. Thanks for your
understanding.

627
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:16,696
[Sigh]

628
00:36:18,437 --> 00:36:19,873
Here you go.

629
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:21,483
Ooh, I can't tell you how
excited I am about this.

630
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:22,919
Well, good. I hope you enjoy it.

631
00:36:22,963 --> 00:36:25,095
Oh I will and I've been telling
everybody about it.

632
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:27,620
I'd buy them all a bottle but
nobody ever pays me back.

633
00:36:27,663 --> 00:36:28,882
Oohh.

634
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:31,145
Uh, it's wonderful. Have you
smelled this?

635
00:36:32,886 --> 00:36:35,018
That is good. What is that?
Lilac?

636
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:38,674
Uh, I don't know flowers, and
this and that.

637
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:40,023
Well, I am off ladies. Goodbye.

638
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:41,547
Goodnight.

639
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:44,898
I have never seen
her that happy.

640
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:49,032
Good. So listen I am taking off.
There's a bunch of towels in the dryer.

641
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:51,861
They're going to be done in like 45 minutes
and I'm gonna fold them tomorrow morning.

642
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:53,472
Okay, great.

643
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:03,003
Edward!

644
00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:04,570
Hey.

645
00:37:04,613 --> 00:37:05,701
How are you?

646
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,181
Starving. Have you eaten?

647
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,835
No.

648
00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:11,446
Of course not you just got off
work. Do you want to join me?

649
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,795
Yeah, that'd be great.

650
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,232
Awesome.

651
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:18,061
Thanks.

652
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:19,193
Of course.

653
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:28,550
I am not ignoring the letters.
I understand that you can take everything.

654
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:31,771
[Creditor on phone] That's what will happen if you
don't make a payment by the end of the month.

655
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:33,686
I-

656
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:37,080
Thank you.

657
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:41,563
Edward didn't come inside?

658
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:45,611
Apparently not. He just
picked up Elinor.

659
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,745
I need you to get something
out of Elinor's locker.

660
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:50,833
What?

661
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:53,445
A bottle of that lotion.

662
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:55,534
You want me to break
into her locker?

663
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:58,928
Yes, is that a problem?

664
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:04,760
No, [sigh] she just sold some today, though,
so I don't think she has any left.

665
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:07,154
Well, then you wait until
she brings some more in

666
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:10,984
and then she won't notice
there's any missing.

667
00:38:11,027 --> 00:38:15,989
Okay, but you have to set
me up with Edward.

668
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:19,471
Done.

669
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:31,570
Yeah, this probably isn't what you had in mind when I mentioned dinner.

670
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:33,746
No, this is perfect. Thank you.

671
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:35,182
My pleasure.

672
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:37,271
I didn't think a place like
this was your style.

673
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:41,841
Well, I wasn't always a lawyer. This is, uh,
kind of reminds me of growing up.

674
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:44,060
Growing up I went to garden
parties and golf tournaments,

675
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:47,020
but this feels more real.
I like it.

676
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:51,329
Good, 'cause ladies first.

677
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:52,155
Uh-oh.

678
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,418
Yeah.

679
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:54,767
I don't think this is going
to go very well.

680
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:55,985
Well, we'll see.

681
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:59,032
Kay, uh uh uh.

682
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,295
Mmm hmm., interesting.

683
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:10,043
Oohh, that wasn't-

684
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:10,870
All right.

685
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:11,610

00:48:40,482 --> 00:48:41,440
Mmm hmm.

867
00:48:41,483 --> 00:48:42,484
Yeah, I can't.

868
00:48:42,528 --> 00:48:43,224
No you can't.

869
00:48:43,268 --> 00:48:43,921
I can't.

870
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:44,660
Exactly. It's hard.

871
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:46,445
How did you know that?

872
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:49,100
Flowers are my thing.

873
00:48:49,578 --> 00:48:51,624
So, what brought you to the
copy room and not a greenhouse?

874
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:54,583
I mean a girl like you seems like she could get a job anywhere.

875
00:48:54,627 --> 00:49:01,416
I tried, but I don't really
have much work experience.

876
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,724
Now my sister, she could run
circles around me.

877
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,552
What does she do?

878
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:10,773
Um, she recently got downsized
so she works at a spa.

879
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:15,953
Well, if you like I could, you know, ask around HR,
see if there's any positions opened up.

880
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:19,957
That's okay. I think she's
warming up to it.

881
00:49:21,915 --> 00:49:25,136
Edward, wow, um, what
brings you here?

882
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:26,441
Just visiting Elinor.

883
00:49:26,485 --> 00:49:27,442
Really?

884
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:28,487
Yeah.

885
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,619
She's working.

886
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:32,491
Didn't you guys just close?

887
00:49:32,534 --> 00:49:34,841
She does all the behind
the scenes things.

888
00:49:34,884 --> 00:49:38,801
Besides, I think you could
do a lot better...

889
00:49:38,845 --> 00:49:40,629
Edward?

890
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:42,762
Hey! Are you done working?

891
00:49:42,805 --> 00:49:44,416
Yes.

892
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:46,592
Excellent. How does
Indian food sound?

893
00:49:46,635 --> 00:49:51,249
Indian food how delicious. I'm
getting hungry myself. Lucy?

894
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:53,991
That sounds delicious. Yes.

895
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:58,299
'Kay, well I should probably get
going. It's been a long day.

896
00:49:58,343 --> 00:49:59,953
Do, do you wanna ride?

897
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,216
No, I'm okay thanks.

898
00:50:03,304 --> 00:50:05,524
Well, shall we?

899
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:06,525
Yeah.

900
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:11,399
What happened?

901
00:50:11,443 --> 00:50:15,490
I don't know. It just died. It
barely made it home.

902
00:50:18,711 --> 00:50:19,886
Now it won't start.

903
00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:22,193
Okay, pop the hood.
Let me take a look.

904
00:50:22,236 --> 00:50:23,411
Okay.

905
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:25,674
Is that it?

906
00:50:25,718 --> 00:50:27,328
Yeah. I think so.

907
00:50:28,938 --> 00:50:30,723
So, how was your day?

908
00:50:30,766 --> 00:50:34,509
Ugh.
I don't know how much longer I can stay working at the spa.

909
00:50:34,553 --> 00:50:36,859
Any jobs opened up at
your office?

910
00:50:36,903 --> 00:50:41,908
No, not really. Hey I had lunch
with a coworker today.

911
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:43,344
Guy or girl?

912
00:50:43,388 --> 00:50:44,650
Guy.

913
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:47,566
Oh, naturally my next
question is, is he cute?

914
00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:50,873
Uh, I don't know I
mean, I guess.

915
00:50:50,917 --> 00:50:52,875
Is he like John cute?

916
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:55,878
Huh, I don't know. Besides it
doesn't matter.

917
00:50:55,922 --> 00:51:00,709
John and I are together and Brandon he's just like way too serious.

918
00:51:00,753 --> 00:51:03,234
Oh, and the mature thing isn't
really for you.

919
00:51:03,277 --> 00:51:04,626
Hey!

920
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:05,845
Ha ha ha [laughing] Okay try it
again. Let's see.

921
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:06,976
All right.

922
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:07,934
[CAR WON'T START]

923
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:16,029
Yep, no. I'm officially calling
it, time of death 6:13 p.m.

924
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,337
No, no. You know what, it just
needs maintenance.

925
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,469
We don't know the first thing
about repair.

926
00:51:21,513 --> 00:51:25,647
Well then we're gonna learn...
and tomorrow we're gonna walk.

927
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:26,953
Mmm [groaning]

928
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:33,090
Ahh, isn't this cool crisp air
invigorating?

929
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:35,048
Yeah, it feels like a
glacial lake.

930
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,268
You know we wouldn't have to walk if you would've gotten a better car.

931
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:39,574
Hey, you know what?
Cars break down.

932
00:51:39,618 --> 00:51:43,056
Yeah but sometimes when you spend less
money upfront it costs you more in the long run.

933
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,927
Wow, that's like the smartest
thing you've ever said.

934
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:48,844
Rude. So, uh how much lotion
have you sold?

935
00:51:49,497 --> 00:51:49,845
Shhhh.

936
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:50,933
What?

937
00:51:50,977 --> 00:51:51,934
You got a place...

938
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:53,458
In the Hamptons.

939
00:51:53,501 --> 00:51:54,328
In the Hamptons.

940
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:55,112
Yeah.

941
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:56,461
Oh, oh.

942
00:52:00,813 --> 00:52:02,162
Is that John?

943
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:04,425
I didn't tell you but you look
beautiful today.

944
00:52:04,947 --> 00:52:06,645
He's back?

945
00:52:08,647 --> 00:52:11,476
I can't believe he did that to
you. He lied.

946
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:13,826
You know there was always something about him that bothered me.

947
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:16,611
Okay, Elinor I really don't want to talk about this right now.
Let's just go to our work.

948
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:18,352
He lied about Switzerland.

949
00:52:18,396 --> 00:52:19,440
We don't know that.

950
00:52:19,484 --> 00:52:21,355
Are you kidding?

951
00:52:21,399 --> 00:52:24,097
It could be a misunderstanding.
That could be his cousin or something.

952
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,100
They looked really chummy
to be cousins.

953
00:52:29,624 --> 00:52:32,018
You know this never would have happened if dad hadn't stolen money.

954
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:33,715
Please, don't make
this about dad.

955
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:36,805
It made John very uncomfortable.
It's been hard on him.

956
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:39,330
This has been really hard
on all of us.

957
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:42,681
When times get tough you see people's
true colors and now we've seen his.

958
00:52:42,724 --> 00:52:44,030
You don't know that.

959
00:52:44,073 --> 00:52:46,467
Stop defending him.

960
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:50,906
Are my copies ready?

961
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:54,649
Oh, yep. There you go.

962
00:52:57,435 --> 00:52:58,392
Hey.

963
00:52:59,872 --> 00:53:00,829
You okay?

964
00:53:00,873 --> 00:53:03,397
Yeah, tough morning.

965
00:53:05,007 --> 00:53:09,011
Um, I wanted to show you
something. Maybe after work?

966
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:10,796
What is it?

967
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:13,755
I can't tell you. I want to but I can't.
It's sort of a surprise.

968
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:15,931
Uh, okay.

969
00:53:15,975 --> 00:53:17,106
Yeah?

970
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:18,673
Sure.

971
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:07,505
Done.

972
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:09,768
Good.

973
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,945
I will have this analyzed.
Figure out what's in it.

974
00:54:12,988 --> 00:54:15,426
Why?

975
00:54:15,469 --> 00:54:18,037
Mmm. I know somebody who would
be interested in buying this.

976
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:22,911
Something that heals would be worth tons and you keep quiet about it.

977
00:54:22,955 --> 00:54:26,915
This could save you your job,
could save the spa.

978
00:54:32,181 --> 00:54:33,574
You ready?

979
00:54:33,618 --> 00:54:35,184
Still not gonna tell me where
we're going?

980
00:54:35,228 --> 00:54:36,664
Nope.

981
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:44,193
So, um, how long have you been
with the company?

982
00:54:44,237 --> 00:54:47,284
Five years? Yeah, five years.

983
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:50,112
Hmm, and family?

984
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:52,245
Out of state.

985
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,073
Pets?

986
00:54:54,116 --> 00:54:58,207
None, but I did have a
goldfish when I was a kid.

987
00:54:58,251 --> 00:54:59,644
[Giggle]

988
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:02,473
Girlfriend?

989
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:07,478
Uh, no. I was engaged
once years ago.

990
00:55:07,521 --> 00:55:10,785
We were probably too young,
but it felt right.

991
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:12,134
What happened?

992
00:55:16,182 --> 00:55:21,709
Her family really wasn't into it.
Mine either come to think about it.

993
00:55:21,753 --> 00:55:26,018
They sort of persuaded us
to, uh, call it off.

994
00:55:26,061 --> 00:55:27,628
Oh.

995
00:55:27,672 --> 00:55:31,023
I think she went on to marry
some oil tycoon or something.

996
00:55:31,066 --> 00:55:35,636
And what about you?
Did you move on?

997
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,074
Took me a while, but yes.

998
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:43,209
And here we are.

999
00:55:43,252 --> 00:55:47,561
Wow, this is amazing.

1000
00:55:49,389 --> 00:55:52,697
So, can you tell me how many
flowers are in this park?

1001
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,786
[Laughing] No.

1002
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:58,224
Come on.
I'll show you my favorite and you can tell me what it actually is.

1003
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:03,316
Hey!

1004
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,144
Hi. Looks like you're in
a good mood?

1005
00:56:05,187 --> 00:56:06,972
Yeah, I had a really
good day today.

1006
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:08,582
What about John?

1007
00:56:08,626 --> 00:56:12,238
Oh well I have found someone to
distract me, Brandon.

1008
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:16,111
Oh, man I just bought all this ice cream thinking
you would be wallowing tonight over John.

1009
00:56:16,155 --> 00:56:18,723
He took me to the most
amazing garden.

1010
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:21,160
Oh, a garden. Good thing I got
a flavor I like.

1011
00:56:21,203 --> 00:56:23,858
I mean he must like me right?

1012
00:56:23,902 --> 00:56:25,599
And John?

1013
00:56:25,643 --> 00:56:26,948
Jerk.

1014
00:56:26,992 --> 00:56:28,210
Huh.

1015
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:34,042
Marianne.

1016
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:34,826
Hey.

1017
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:36,828
Hey.

1018
00:56:36,871 --> 00:56:39,570
Thank you so much for taking me to the garden.
I had a really good time.

1019
00:56:39,613 --> 00:56:42,616
So did I. I was actually looking for you.
Do you wanna get some, uh, lunch?

1020
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:45,053
I'm actually gonna get lunch
with my sister.

1021
00:56:45,097 --> 00:56:46,838
Hey, I thought we were
meeting at the cafe.

1022
00:56:46,881 --> 00:56:49,231
I was early, so, I thought
I'd come by.

1023
00:56:49,275 --> 00:56:50,232
Hi. Brandon Hurst.

1024
00:56:50,276 --> 00:56:51,538
Elinor Dashwood.

1025
00:56:51,582 --> 00:56:55,150
Dashwood? I thought your last
name was Webb?

1026
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:59,720
Um. It's my uh mother's
maiden name.

1027
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:03,071
No jobs open, either, huh?

1028
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:06,379
Elinor! [Sigh]

1029
00:57:12,951 --> 00:57:14,126
Hey.

1030
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:21,612
Must be so nice. Having a good job with people
around you who don't care what your name is.

1031
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:23,875
I didn't want all the questions.

1032
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:26,268
Uh, I probably wouldn't have
gotten the job if I hadn't-

1033
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:31,926
Lied to them. To Brandon,
to me.

1034
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:36,714
I just, I just had no idea how
selfish you are.

1035
00:57:36,757 --> 00:57:38,890
Selfish?

1036
00:57:38,933 --> 00:57:45,462
I have been doing pretty well considering we don't have,
I don't know, a TV, a car.

1037
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:47,507
I haven't complained once!

1038
00:57:47,551 --> 00:57:52,469
All you do is complain and while you've
been wallowing in your own self pity

1039
00:57:52,512 --> 00:57:55,297
I have been trying to
make this work!

1040
00:57:55,341 --> 00:57:57,735
Do you think it was easy going around from interview to interview

1041
00:57:57,778 --> 00:58:00,041
with each person judging me and
laughing me out the door?

1042
00:58:00,085 --> 00:58:03,392
Okay so that's why I did what I did so
the same thing wouldn't happen to me.

1043
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:10,008
No, what you did was worse.
You told me there were no jobs available at your office.

1044
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:15,230
I have been scrubbing toilets
and cleaning out clogged drains

1045
00:58:15,274 --> 00:58:18,190
with Fran watching over my
shoulder.

1046
00:58:18,233 --> 00:58:21,802
Do you know how much more money we
could have made if I had a better job?

1047
00:58:24,544 --> 00:58:27,329
You're assuming they'd even
hire you.

1048
00:58:28,766 --> 00:58:31,464
Uh, yeah I am.

1049
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:36,121
Then again I also assumed that
you cared about Margarett.

1050
00:58:44,346 --> 00:58:46,131
[Doorbell rings]

1051
00:58:53,878 --> 00:58:54,269
Hey.

1052
00:58:54,313 --> 00:58:56,054
Hey.

1053
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:57,534
You okay?

1054
00:59:01,015 --> 00:59:02,713
Dashwood?

1055
00:59:02,756 --> 00:59:04,192
Yep.

1056
00:59:06,412 --> 00:59:08,196
It fits you better.

1057
00:59:09,023 --> 00:59:10,372
So you're not upset?

1058
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:13,898
I know you. Your name doesn't
change anything.

1059
00:59:14,246 --> 00:59:15,987
Well it does to a lot of
people.

1060
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:17,815
Well not me.

1061
00:59:18,598 --> 00:59:20,948
Are you and Elinor going to be
okay?

1062
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:23,429
I hope so.

1063
00:59:30,784 --> 00:59:32,394
Gotta make you feel better.

1064
00:59:32,438 --> 00:59:34,396
Sweet, thank you.

1065
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:38,052
All right, I have to ask.

1066
00:59:38,096 --> 00:59:39,488
What is all this?

1067
00:59:39,532 --> 00:59:41,055
Well, you know my obsession
with flowers?

1068
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:41,969
Mmhm.

1069
00:59:42,013 --> 00:59:43,275
This is what I do with them.

1070
00:59:45,407 --> 00:59:46,757
You destroy them?

1071
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,021
No, I make scented lotion.

1072
00:59:50,064 --> 00:59:51,413
Here do you want to try?

1073
00:59:51,457 --> 00:59:52,501
Sure.

1074
00:59:54,547 --> 00:59:59,421
Put some petals right there and just go
ahead and start mixing them around.

1075
00:59:59,465 --> 01:00:02,599
One more for you. But in a
circular motion.

1076
01:00:02,642 --> 01:00:05,166
Really?

1077
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:10,868
And you'll start to see some oils and then you
just keep on going until all the pieces are gone.

1078
01:00:11,912 --> 01:00:13,261
Smells planty.

1079
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:15,960
You need to mix some more
things in it.

1080
01:00:18,092 --> 01:00:18,832
Ow!

1081
01:00:18,876 --> 01:00:19,441
Oh.

1082
01:00:19,485 --> 01:00:20,573
Ow.

1083
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,443
Are you okay?

1084
01:00:21,487 --> 01:00:22,314
Yeah, yeah.

1085
01:00:22,357 --> 01:00:23,402
Oohh.

1086
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:25,447
I'm fine. I'm fine. Yeah.

1087
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:27,536
Well, that is not going to
help, here.

1088
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:28,929
Let's try this.

1089
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:31,453
Right there?

1090
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:32,933
Yeah.

1091
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:39,244
How's that feel?

1092
01:00:39,287 --> 01:00:40,898
Better.

1093
01:00:53,475 --> 01:00:57,044
What do you mean it doesn't
work? I tried the lotion myself.

1094
01:00:57,088 --> 01:00:59,438
[From Phone] It causes an itchy
rash

1095
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:03,529
An itchy rash? Well then, you got the ingredients wrong.
Did you double check the analysis?

1096
01:01:03,572 --> 01:01:05,836
[From Phone] Yes we did. We
triple checked it.

1097
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:12,451
Well then, then there's got to be something in the process.
Uh, uh try some variations.

1098
01:01:12,494 --> 01:01:13,974
[From Phone] Okay extra costs
will be incurred.

1099
01:01:14,018 --> 01:01:17,064
I am paying you plenty for
this.

1100
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:18,587
[From Phone] The time and
resources cost money.

1101
01:01:18,631 --> 01:01:20,198
Okay, okay.

1102
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:20,677
[From Phone] Good.

1103
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,373
Fine

1104
01:01:21,416 --> 01:01:21,982
[From Phone] Good.

1105
01:01:22,026 --> 01:01:23,027
Fine!

1106
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:43,525
It's Fran Farris.

1107
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:47,616
Well, that wasn't a very nice
thing to say John.

1108
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:50,141
I need you to do
something for me.

1109
01:01:51,011 --> 01:01:53,057
I don't care what you're
in the middle of.

1110
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:58,192
You do this for me and I will conveniently forget about Eliza Williams.

1111
01:01:58,236 --> 01:02:02,893
Rumor has it that if your family were to find
out about her that you would be disinherited.

1112
01:02:02,936 --> 01:02:04,242
You understand?

1113
01:02:06,374 --> 01:02:07,506
Good.

1114
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:13,338
You need any help?

1115
01:02:15,296 --> 01:02:16,515
[Sigh]

1116
01:02:16,558 --> 01:02:20,998
I'm really sorry. I shouldn't
have lied.

1117
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:23,609
You hand me that pan?

1118
01:02:27,395 --> 01:02:28,962
All right.

1119
01:02:29,006 --> 01:02:31,312
Okay, just put it under the
engine.

1120
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:35,708
Do you want me to climb under
there? Okay, okay!

1121
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,362
I've been through worse things
at the spa.

1122
01:02:37,405 --> 01:02:38,319
I'm going.

1123
01:02:38,363 --> 01:02:39,233
Okay.

1124
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:44,978
All right, pan's in place.

1125
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,241
All right, here we go.

1126
01:02:49,635 --> 01:02:50,288
Aahh!

1127
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:51,463
What happened?

1128
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:58,252
Oohh. Oh no. Oh no.

1129
01:02:58,296 --> 01:02:59,166
Don't laugh.

1130
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,081
[Laughing] Oh no!

1131
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:01,952
It's not funny.

1132
01:03:01,995 --> 01:03:03,301
Yes, it's very funny.

1133
01:03:03,344 --> 01:03:04,476
Hand me that towel

1134
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:05,390
A clean towel.

1135
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:07,522
Okay a clean towel. [Laughing]

1136
01:03:09,655 --> 01:03:10,787
Ughhhh.

1137
01:03:11,483 --> 01:03:12,484
Everything okay?

1138
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:14,007
Yeah, it's peachy.

1139
01:03:17,489 --> 01:03:19,578
What's wrong with the truck?

1140
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:24,191
Um, I don't know.
It won't start so I tried changing the oil but it didn't work.

1141
01:03:24,235 --> 01:03:25,323
Do you mind if I take a look?

1142
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:27,978
No, oh please yes.

1143
01:03:28,456 --> 01:03:29,980
So, how's work going
by the way.

1144
01:03:30,023 --> 01:03:32,156
Work is fine, most days.

1145
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:35,115
I did have to scrub a pair of
sheets by hand the other day.

1146
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:36,377
Ew, you're kidding me.

1147
01:03:36,421 --> 01:03:37,335
I wish.

1148
01:03:38,075 --> 01:03:39,641
And, uh, my sister?

1149
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:41,295
Your sister's good. She's fine.

1150
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:43,297
Huh, you're holding back.

1151
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:49,477
Um, I uh,
I get the feeling that she doesn't approve of me or something.

1152
01:03:49,521 --> 01:03:51,218
I don't know how much longer
I'm gonna be working there.

1153
01:03:51,262 --> 01:03:53,655
Yeah my sister can be a little
judgmental sometimes.

1154
01:03:53,699 --> 01:03:54,700
Sometimes?

1155
01:03:56,093 --> 01:03:57,746
Okay, give it a shot.

1156
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:58,530
Okay.

[Car Starts]

1158
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:04,188
How'd you do that?

1159
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:05,842
Hm, it wasn't the oil.

1160
01:04:07,452 --> 01:04:09,628
I watch a lot of car shows.

1161
01:04:12,326 --> 01:04:16,156
Trust me Dillan, once we get the bugs worked out
this is going to be very lucrative for both of us.

1162
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,290
I think your company's going to
be blown away by the potential.

1163
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:22,249
[From Phone] You realize that going to bat for this puts me at risk, Fran.

1164
01:04:22,293 --> 01:04:25,078
You mess this up my reputation
suffers.

1165
01:04:25,122 --> 01:04:28,603
Oh, you won't be disappointed.
Neither will your company.

1166
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:32,564
[From Phone] When can I expect this to be fixed?
My people are asking about it.

1167
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:37,699
I have my entire team working
on it as we speak.

1168
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:52,758
Surprise, I'm back! What are
you not excited to see me?

1169
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:57,197
Oh oh are you talking to me or the blonde
girl you were holding hands with in the park

1170
01:04:57,241 --> 01:04:59,199
while you were supposed to be
in Switzerland?

1171
01:04:59,243 --> 01:05:01,985
Uh, look it's not what you
think. She's just a friend.

1172
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:05,379
Oh, that looked like more than a friendship and that
still doesn't explain what you're even doing here.

1173
01:05:05,423 --> 01:05:08,556
I know it looks bad,
but after your dad was arrested I was tainted.

1174
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,602
The job in Switzerland fell
through.

1175
01:05:11,342 --> 01:05:12,734
You said it was still going.

1176
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:14,606
I know. I didn't know what
else to do.

1177
01:05:14,649 --> 01:05:16,347
Maybe not lie.

1178
01:05:18,305 --> 01:05:19,785
And I was afraid that being with you would make it even harder for me.

1179
01:05:21,787 --> 01:05:23,397
Because I'm a Dashwood?

1180
01:05:25,443 --> 01:05:26,835
Stupid, I know.

1181
01:05:30,622 --> 01:05:31,797
Who is she?

1182
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:36,758
Crystal? It's just someone to talk to.
It meant nothing, honestly.

1183
01:05:36,802 --> 01:05:41,111
Look I made a mistake. Can't we
just start over?

1184
01:05:43,635 --> 01:05:46,725
I don't think I'm every going
to be able to trust you again.

1185
01:05:46,768 --> 01:05:49,206
Let me make it up to you.

1186
01:05:53,253 --> 01:05:55,952
By the way, how's the uh hobby
going?

1187
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:57,605
It's good.

1188
01:05:59,433 --> 01:06:01,392
Well you should show me how you do it.
I love to watch you work.

1189
01:06:02,523 --> 01:06:04,873
You've never cared before.

1190
01:06:05,483 --> 01:06:07,267
I do now.

1191
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:11,837
Maybe some other time, not
tonight.

1192
01:06:13,317 --> 01:06:14,492
Later then.

1193
01:06:15,667 --> 01:06:19,671

flowers.

1195
01:06:57,665 --> 01:07:01,495
Hey John. Yes, I got them.

1196
01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:02,714
They're beautiful.

1197
01:07:04,411 --> 01:07:06,326
Yeah, I miss you too.

Um, hmm, well what time?

1201
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:19,861
You know I'm actually still at work so do
do you mind if I just call you when I leave?

Okay, bye.

Hey Lucy, um, listen I just noticed that there was
a little bit of damage to the lock on my locker.

1204
01:07:34,441 --> 01:07:36,617
I was wondering if you knew
what happened?

1205
01:07:36,661 --> 01:07:38,793
Why would I know that?

1206
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:41,187
Oh no, I don't know.
I mean I...

1207
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:45,539
You know what I wouldn't worry about it it's just that, um,
I think I'm missing something.

You think?

1209
01:07:47,585 --> 01:07:51,719
I'm pretty sure.

They did steal it.

Fran's been drowning in debt.
She must have seen this as her way out.

1392
01:18:07,726 --> 01:18:09,641
So, what are you going to do?

1393
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,512
I mean you can't let them get away with it.
Can't you call the police.

1394
01:18:11,556 --> 01:18:13,384
No, that won't amount to
anything.

We can beat Fran to it.

1399

All right this pitch has to be perfect.
It's a long shot, but I'm hoping they'll listen to me.

all the facts for your company's sake.

Facts?

1425

This man is obviously in the
wrong room.

1426
01:19:38,338 --> 01:19:41,080
The formula Ms. Farris is
trying to sell you is stolen.

1427
01:19:41,124 --> 01:19:44,649
Which we can prove quite easily with Ms.
Dashwood's documentation.

1428
01:19:46,694 --> 01:19:48,609
How do we know this is
legitimate?

1429
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:50,698
The proof is all there but in the meantime we've filed an injunction

1430
01:19:50,742 --> 01:19:53,136
against Ms. Farris that
prohibits this sale.

1431
01:19:54,137 --> 01:19:56,400
Edward are you sure this is
the right time to be...

1432
01:19:56,443 --> 01:19:57,140
Yes.

1433
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,576
Definitely.

1434
01:19:58,619 --> 01:20:01,144
We'll need our team to get to
the bottom of this.

1435
01:20:01,187 --> 01:20:03,668
That's understandable.
We wouldn't want you to become victims of Ms. Farris' actions as well.

1436
01:20:03,711 --> 01:20:06,236
However we've presented this
lotion to another company

1437
01:20:06,279 --> 01:20:08,064
that has agreed to purchase the
formula.

1438
01:20:08,107 --> 01:20:11,284

1439
01:20:11,328 --> 01:20:17,421
I don't know where these people came from,
but there's clearly been some sort of mistake.

1441

to Elinor thinking she was going to steal from you,

1453
01:21:12,563 --> 01:21:15,218
then you stole from her.

1454
01:21:17,611 --> 01:21:22,268

it wrong.
