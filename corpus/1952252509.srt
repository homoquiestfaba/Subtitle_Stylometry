'cause I've done it before,
a ton of times.

510
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:49,491
- Do it.
- All right, hotshot.
I will.

511
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,112
Why don't you
settle down for a second.
Let me get my bearings here.

512
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,764
Whoo!

513
00:33:57,767 --> 00:33:59,935
Oh, she is not normal.

00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:01,270
Shit.

It's awesome!
[ Digger Clucking ]

523
00:34:25,612 --> 00:34:27,563
I'm comin' right down.
[ Lucy ] Whoo!

524
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:31,800
[ Digger ]
Uh-oh. Looks like someone
needs to borrow a pair.

¶ I love you ¶

531
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:58,544
I figured out
how to stop the casino.

532
00:34:59,696 --> 00:35:02,164
I wrote a letter to the mayor.
Did I tell you that?

533
00:35:02,232 --> 00:35:05,200
Mm-mmm. You know what you need?
A petition.

534
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:08,337
Otherwise known as
"Why would you do that?"

535
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:11,273
A petition.

536
00:35:11,341 --> 00:35:14,310
I did it in school to
get rid of a vice principal.

537
00:35:14,377 --> 00:35:16,812
He was creeping me out.

538
00:35:17,914 --> 00:35:21,650
Oh, yeah.
How'd that go?
Got expelled.

539
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:23,902
That's genius.

540
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:28,039
A-- A petition.
A petition to put the casino
to a town vote.

541
00:35:28,107 --> 00:35:31,943
Don't you guys get it?
Everybody wants this casino.

542
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:33,962
<i>Who would vote on that?
I'd sign.</i>

543
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:36,165
Yeah. I'd sign.

544
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:38,049
That's-That's one--

545
00:35:41,854 --> 00:35:44,523
Oh, so just--
Oh, it's just you two
against the entire town.

546
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:46,558
No, man.
Others would join.
Are you kidding?

547
00:35:46,626 --> 00:35:49,728
There'd be a lot of people.
It's called democracy. That's
what democracy is all about.

548
00:35:49,795 --> 00:35:52,097
Dude, it's called
"What is your deal--
with this thing?"

549
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:54,299
Just let it go.

550
00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:56,819
Stupid easy money
is still stupid,
even if it's easy.

551
00:35:56,886 --> 00:36:00,522
But, dude, stupid easy money--
You make "stupid easy money"
sound like it's a problem,

552
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,475
not a solution.

553
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,794
I'm sorry. You trying
to impress somebody?

554
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:07,763
Wow. Okay.

00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:10,833

Mmm.

There doesn't seem to be
as many-- many people
here as last year.

560
00:36:23,129 --> 00:36:25,264
Yeah. That's, uh,
stating the obvious.

561
00:36:25,331 --> 00:36:27,999
You think it's 'cause of
the downturn in the local
business affairs?

562
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:31,903
Do-- [ Chuckles ]
That's only
a newspaper headline.

563
00:36:31,971 --> 00:36:34,306
You haven't been reading
a newspaper, have you?

564
00:36:34,374 --> 00:36:39,211
- What do you mean?
- Nothin'. I just, you know,
got worried for a second.

565
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:41,213
Stop it.
What?

566
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:43,665
You're being mean.

567
00:36:44,968 --> 00:36:47,536
What are those Indian fellas
doing here in town?

568
00:36:47,687 --> 00:36:50,388
They are, uh,
you know, previously...

569
00:36:50,456 --> 00:36:53,775
oppressed peoples of America,
so be nice to 'em--
you and all the girls.

Is something going on?
No.

571
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:57,813
And don't ask questions.

572
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:00,999
I made a casserole tonight.
No.

573
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:04,019
For dinner. No?
No. And I might sleep
at the office.

574
00:37:04,087 --> 00:37:06,155
I can bring the casserole--
Just go to bed.

575
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:08,541
Oh, you got a girlfriend
or something?

00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:11,327

Yeah. I do.

00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:16,549
Oh, this is weird.
Uh, her name is
"official town business."

578
00:37:16,616 --> 00:37:18,984
Sorry. I love you.

579
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:21,403
Love you too.
Okay. Come here.

00:37:22,672 --> 00:37:25,074
Okay.

581
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,143
Bye.

582
00:37:41,474 --> 00:37:44,326
Where'd that come from?

583
00:37:44,394 --> 00:37:47,062
<i>It's amazing how much
happened here.</i>

584
00:37:47,129 --> 00:37:49,097
I mean,
it would blow your mind,

585
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:52,601
the history that was here--
that is here.

586
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,453
In 1776,

587
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,689
these, uh, American soldiers
coming home for Christmas...

588
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:58,691
were ambushed by 50 British.

589
00:37:58,758 --> 00:38:02,294
They were severely
outnumbered. Right here.

590
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:04,996
You see, the Americans
got clobbered,
and they surrendered fast,

591
00:38:05,064 --> 00:38:09,301
but, um, it was so cold out,
everyone was freezing--

592
00:38:09,368 --> 00:38:11,670
captor and captive.

593
00:38:11,738 --> 00:38:13,739
So they cut a deal.

594
00:38:13,806 --> 00:38:17,309
The Americans let
the British pretend to hold
the entire town.

595
00:38:17,376 --> 00:38:21,730
That way, no one got hurt, and
they were able to get regular
supplies from the British army.

596
00:38:21,797 --> 00:38:25,951
And then, when the war was over,
they gave each British guy,
like, a little piece of land.

597
00:38:26,018 --> 00:38:28,253
Sneaky.
[ Chuckles ]

598
00:38:28,321 --> 00:38:31,006

Oh.

603
00:38:47,206 --> 00:38:51,043
I thought, in towns like this,
the mayor usually has a day job
to go along with the...

604
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:54,146
great honor of the mayorship.

I'm the first man
on the scene, as they say.

610
00:39:08,278 --> 00:39:10,646
My job is to keep things
clean in the beginning,

611
00:39:10,714 --> 00:39:14,550
when things can be
their most... unruly.

612
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,385
Okay, I've seen
all the tricks.

613
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:22,324
Every single one of them.
The Indians have something
the white man wants-- again--

614
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:25,727
and the white man
will do anything to get it.

615
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:28,397
[ Clears Throat ]

616
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:30,532
You're white.

617
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,268
You're observant.
I like that.

618
00:39:35,071 --> 00:39:38,406
It's obvious
why you're the mayor here.
Very smart man.

619
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:40,142
Thank you.
Anyway,

620
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:43,045
I'm just here until the tribe
settles on a location...

621
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:47,449
and the official
locating agreement is signed
by all necessary parties.

622
00:39:47,516 --> 00:39:49,768
Then somebody
has themselves a casino.

623
00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:53,155
And that, of course,
is when the real bureaucracy
takes over.

624
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:57,475
That is a real kettle
of old fish heads,
if you know what I mean.

625
00:39:57,627 --> 00:39:59,694
But before that,

626
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,715
it's my apples on the line.

627
00:40:02,782 --> 00:40:05,617
So, to get down to
brass tacks,

628
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:08,536
if anything messes
with my apples,

629
00:40:08,605 --> 00:40:10,872
that means
no locating agreement.

630
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,475
And that means...

631
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:15,477
no casino.

632
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:20,315
I have your apples
in my capable hands.

<i>- Mayor, all due respect--
- We know the casino is coming.
We know--</i>

- How would you know about that?
- Oh, his dad--

653
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:14,386
No, no, no.
Dad-- His dad--

654
00:41:14,453 --> 00:41:17,672
Great. So, moving on.
The town needs money.
We're in dire straits.

History can't happen again
without progress.
Ah?

656
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,927
Right?
So let's progress.

657
00:41:22,995 --> 00:41:26,465
Let's allow
the red man to come in
and build a casino--

658
00:41:26,532 --> 00:41:28,600
I think "red man"
is disresp--
And let's all get rich.

659
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:31,019
- No, that's an actual term.
- We're gonna get
a casino in here.

660
00:41:31,087 --> 00:41:32,838
We're gonna put it
on your battlefield.

661
00:41:32,905 --> 00:41:35,474
And we're gonna make
enough money to fix
the water system,

662
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:37,542
and you'll get
new school uniforms.

663
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,629
<i>- And what else would bring in
tourists? Nothing.
- [ Chase ] Oh, I don't know.</i>

664
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:43,565
Maybe our beautiful
history that we have,
that we want to preserve here.

665
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:46,785
The fact that an amazing battle
took place right here
on our own hallowed ground.

666
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:48,687
<i>Maybe that would bring in
some tourists.</i>

667
00:41:48,754 --> 00:41:52,408
It's not about glamorous,
sleazy casinos,
which any town could have.

668
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:55,194
We have a real place
in history, and that's how
we have to attract--

669
00:41:55,261 --> 00:41:57,579
Can I tell you something?
And this might disappoint you.

670
00:41:57,647 --> 00:41:59,715
That whole battle
is an urban myth.

671
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,884
