1
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:35,180
<i>Jesus, that is loud.</i>

2
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,018
I'd call and complain, too.

3
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,525
Neighbors also said
there was screaming.

4
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,821
It's the police!

5
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,286
Hey, shouldn't we
wait for backup?

6
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,292
<i>You wait.</i>

7
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,102
Are you
checkin' this out?

8
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:55,967
Now!

9
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,428
- Police!
- Freeze!

10
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,474
Ma'am?

11
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,270
You all right?

12
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:09,748
Is she alone in here?

13
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,010
Ma'am?

14
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,248
Oh, my God.

15
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,587
What the f...

16
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:20,887
Blaine!

17
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,253
Officer...

18
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,489
Officer down.

19
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,678
Move it back, people!

20
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,416
Please. Step back.
Move back.

21
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,719
Ready to go live
in three...

22
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,725
two...

23
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:28,726
And one.

24
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,456
It's... it's
indescribable.

25
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,361
This... This horrific
crime scene

26
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,400
where a rookie officer
has been savagely

27
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,628
hacked to death at this
dilapidated residence.

28
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,295
<i>..in what
authorities have described</i>

29
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,100
<i>as a gruesome crime scene,</i>

30
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,175
<i>two officers entered
this abandoned building</i>

31
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,367
<i>earlier this afternoon.</i>

32
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,775
<i>What they found inside
is simply too grisly...</i>

33
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,642
<i>The young officer
who lost his life</i>

34
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,545
<i>in this attack
has not been identified</i>

35
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,276
<i>pending notification
of next of kin.</i>

36
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,646
<i>Williams risked his own life</i>

37
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,653
<i>to rescue the young woman
being held hostage</i>

38
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,484
<i>on the premises.
So far, the remains...</i>

39
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,649
<i>So far, seven human
remains have been unearthed,</i>

40
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,818
<i>all with the eyes
grotesquely removed</i>

41
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,191
<i>in what police are saying
is one of the most diabolical...</i>

42
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,264
<i>The only possible clue
to the horrendous acts</i>

43
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,230
<i>which occurred here today
lay in the hands</i>

44
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,029
<i>of two very shaken
survivors.</i>

45
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:10,967
<i>14-year police veteran
Frank Williams</i>

46
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,868
<i>is the only surviving officer.</i>

47
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,237
<i>He's being taken from the scene
with severe injuries,</i>

48
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,400
<i>and at this point,</i>

49
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,909
<i>his condition
is listed as critical.</i>

50
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:20,104
<i>..for any clues
they can provide.</i>

51
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,411
<i>..female victim,</i>

52
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,077
<i>who was brutally blinded.</i>

53
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:28,415
<i>..will be consulted</i>

54
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,183
<i>as numerous unsolved mysteries
may be laid to rest</i>

55
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,416
<i>with these tragic...</i>

56
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,550
<i>Investigators
are anxious to question</i>

57
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,423
<i>Sergeant Williams
and the female...</i>

58
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,928
<i>For now, both will be rushed</i>

59
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,657
<i>to Overland General
for psychiatric evaluation</i>

60
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,255
<i>and trauma care.</i>

61
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,835
<i>Stay tuned
to this developing story as...</i>

62
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,291
- Hey, Russell.
- What, dude?

63
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,061
Check this out, bro.

64
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,294
I don't need to.

65
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,495
Help a white boy out.

66
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,469
Sweet.

67
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,062
Keep it down back there.

68
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,675
Gentlemen,
can we move it?

69
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,677
How many more miles?

70
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,746
Richie, please.

71
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,639
Shut up, man.

72
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,056
I found these condoms.

73
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:14,689
Why are you
looking at me? God.

74
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,193
Busted.

75
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,495
We need to be able
to trust you guys.

76
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,160
This is the first coed
program of its kind.

77
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,329
So, again...

78
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,837
no fraternizing.

79
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,843
Melissa?

80
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,605
Melissa!

81
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,638
Ma'am?

82
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,115
She's the last person

83
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,776
you've got to worry about.

84
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,787
You bitch.

85
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,879
Oh, my God.
The mute spoke.

86
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,753
Watch your ass, slut.

87
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,955
What, like the way
you watch Kira's?

88
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,859
Dyke.

89
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:51,862
Ladies.

90
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,828
They're here.

91
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,973
Bunch of losers.

92
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,738
Hope they had their shots.

93
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,078
Zo, pass me
my bag, please.

94
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:13,641
Sure.

95
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,458
Thanks.

96
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,188
Dude, you better
back up off me.

97
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,766
I just about had
enough of your shit.

98
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:29,857
Oh, my God.

99
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,437
Move me, boy.

100
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,028
- What?
- Son of a bitch.

101
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,697
I got your boy.
I'm'a show...

102
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:35,740
Let's go, shithead.

103
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:36,866
- Hey!
- "Boy," huh?

104
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,002
You two knock it off.

105
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,511
I said knock it off!

106
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,511
Fuckface.

107
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,104
You'd rather stay here?

108
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,480
Go back inside?

109
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,552
Now, get goin'.

110
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,782
Hey, Frank.

111
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:53,882
<i>I thought my group
was animals.</i>

112
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,121
Those two gonna make it?

113
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,491
We'll see.

114
00:09:58,732 --> 00:09:59,630
Hello, ladies.

115
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,132
Don't sit next to me.

116
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,633
<i>What are you lookin' at?</i>

117
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:18,150
Hello, everyone.
I'm Hannah Anders.

118
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,116
This is Frank Williams.

119
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,188
You guys know that
your hard work this weekend

120
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,153
will pay off
in shorter sentences.

121
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:27,192
I hope you can prove to us
that we made the right decision

122
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,885
in choosing you
for this program.

123
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:31,526
What's up,
squeaky tweaker?

124
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,030
Fuck you, Mike.

125
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,630
Been there.
Done that.

126
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,171
I used to hit that shit.

127
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,797
Is that what you call it?

128
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:43,102
What, I say somethin'?

129
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,673
Dumb-ass.

130
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,076
You talkin' to me, Rufus?

131
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,477
- Yeah.
- You know what?

132
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,139
You might want to move.

133
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,480
Hey!

134
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,453
- Oh my God.
- Hey!

135
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:59,252
Break it up back there!

136
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,986
I said break it up.

137
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,688
What? I didn't do shit.

138
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,198
I don't care. Act up again,

139
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:08,199
we turn around.

140
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,030
That goes for all of you.

141
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,601
God, his hand.
What happened to him?

142
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,198
You mean the claw?

143
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,277
Leprosy.

144
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,675
I heard Chihuahua attack.

145
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,486
Hey, you're, like, the dog
pound liberator, huh?

146
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,490
Dog pound liberator?

147
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:35,186
Yeah. They were
gonna gas 'em.

148
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,051
Nice move, though.

149
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,197
I respect that.

150
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,502
I'm gonna need drugs.

151
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,337
I heard that.

152
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,967
Where the fuck
are they taking us?

153
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,477
Yo, Tye.

154
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,918
- Tye.
- Come on, man.

155
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,423
Can't a brother
get some rest?

156
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:08,323
Look, I might had
a proposition for you.

157
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:10,924
For me.

158
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,997
Yeah.

159
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,426
I'm listenin'.

160
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,171
Okay, everyone, this is it.

161
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,373
Damn.

162
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,042
<i>What is this? Hotel Ghetto?</i>

163
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,018
<i>Like you'd know.</i>

164
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,715
<i>I thought my 'hood was bad.</i>

165
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,758
Mr. Williams.

166
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,093
I'm so glad this worked out.

167
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,131
Me, too, Margaret.

168
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,632
Thanks for the opportunity.

169
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,965
How's our first group?

170
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,128
Not so good.

171
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,536
Some a little worse than others.

172
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,810
<i>We left County for this?</i>

173
00:12:58,912 --> 00:12:59,879
'Scuse me.

174
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,643
Let's go.

175
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,740
Slave labor bullshit.

176
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:16,554
Oh my God.

177
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,324
What a dump.

178
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,458
Damn!

179
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,401
Smelled better on the bus.

180
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,801
I wonder if there's cable.

181
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:26,803
Knock it off.

182
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,999
Good afternoon, everyone.

183
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,508
I'm Margaret Gaine.

184
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,010
I'm involved in the renovation

185
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,410
of historical landmarks.
This property

186
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,006
was donated to us
a few years ago.

187
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,177
We toyed with the idea
of reopening the hotel,

188
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,448
but honestly,
what this part of town

189
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,423
really needs is a shelter
for the homeless.

190
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:49,154
That's where
you guys come in.

191
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,160
What, homeless?

192
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,594
No, dear.

193
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:52,824
Volunteers.

194
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:53,830
We didn't volunteer.

195
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:54,797
Dude.

196
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,425
Can't you ever
fuckin' shut up?

197
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:57,468
Eat me.

198
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,333
Oh, yeah.
Good comeback.

199
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,701
Fuck you.

200
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,707
Uh, what museum...

201
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,606
did you say you
work for, granny?

202
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,804
Guys. You know the tradeoff

203
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,177
for three days' work
is a month off your sentence.

204
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,306
That's not a bad deal.

205
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,055
Let me tell you somethin'.

206
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,090
Hannah and I are
here on a weekend

207
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,626
because we believe
in second chances.

208
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,025
Don't prove us wrong.

209
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,063
For the next three days,
if Margaret asks you

210
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,064
to do somethin',
you better do it.

211
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,190
You got it?

212
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,201
Who wants a tour?

213
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,298
- Mr. Blackwell built the hotel
- I can't believe this.

214
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,742
As a playground for
himself and his friends.

215
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:42,076
Rumor has it that there
are hidden passageways

216
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,443
and two-way mirrors all over,

217
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,380
although I've never found them.

218
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,476
We've almost finished
renovating the suites

219
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,554
on the second floor.

220
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,247
That's where
you'll all be staying.

221
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,415
Penthouse floors, however,
on eight and nine

222
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,925
are off-limits.
It's too dangerous for guests.

223
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:55,926
Why? What happened?

224
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,223
There was a fire in '71.

225
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,262
It gutted them.

226
00:14:58,364 --> 00:14:59,831
It killed Mr. Blackwell,
his wife,

227
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,160
and a few others.

228
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,327
And since the hotel was

229
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,904
more of a hobby
than a business,

230
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,599
it's never been repaired.

231
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,471
Besides, we don't
want your parents

232
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,544
suing us if you
get hurt, now, do we?

233
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,706
Oh. Before I forget.
During mealtimes,

234
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:18,943
you all can eat
in the atrium.

235
00:15:19,052 --> 00:15:21,714
However, the doors must
remain locked at night.

236
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,518
So. Ladies...

237
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:25,716
grab a trash bag.

238
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:27,918
Gentlemen, brooms.

239
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,460
Michael, is it?

240
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,757
Yeah. You want me
to be shot caller?

241
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,492
No. No, we want you to mop.

242
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,033
The lavatory's over there.

243
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,965
Your heard her, Mike.
Get the mop.

244
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,067
Hey, I'm tryin'
to clean here!

245
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,341
Cut it out!

246
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:49,873
Oh, sh...

247
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,438
Hello?

248
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:05,958
Hello?

249
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,690
- Shh!
- You scared me!

250
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,731
Keep your voice down.

251
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,735
Did you open that?

252
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,305
Yeah. I'm gettin'
the fuck outta here.

253
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,010
What?

254
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:34,244
This only leads out
to the atrium.

255
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,821
You'd still be
inside the hotel.

256
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,157
Jesus!

257
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,524
Nice try, though.

258
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,430
Come on, don't let
Michael get to your head.

259
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,230
You don't understand.

260
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,365
Where'd you get those?

261
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,409
What's-her-name.
She lifted 'em off Hannah.

262
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,671
Oh. Zoe.

263
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,280
Yeah. Zoe.

264
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,309
I just can't believe
the same asshole

265
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,545
that got me locked up

266
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,086
is gonna be sleepin'
down the hall.

267
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,780
You know?

268
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,857
I know.

269
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,589
Can I have one?

270
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:21,325
Shit.

271
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:24,703
We were just...

272
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,787
Thanks, girls.

273
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,092
Try not to burn
the place down.

274
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,925
Yes, sir.

275
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,393
Okay.

276
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,670
You think he whacks off
with that thing?

277
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:04,674
Definitely.

278
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,187
Tye.

279
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,848
What's up?

280
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,482
All that, uh,
all that stuff

281
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,491
about the hidden rooms,

282
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:23,858
the passages,
the stairwells?

283
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,624
All true.

284
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,063
This is what I was
talkin' about on the bus.

285
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,868
So what?

286
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,603
Okay. This is
where you come in.

287
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,939
Can you crack a safe?

288
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,445
Please. Open 'em
like I open

289
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,139
your mama's legs.

290
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:45,217
<i>Good, 'cause
there is a safe.</i>

291
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:46,376
Here.

292
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,975
Blackwell's private stash.

293
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,349
Never been recovered.

294
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,387
Why not?

295
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,252
No one knows about it.

296
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,918
I mean, this place
is a goddamn maze, but...

297
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,153
I got the blueprints.

298
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,287
Look, man, I'm not tryin'
to get no more time.

299
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,489
You won't.
You won't. Look,

300
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,396
if we get caught wandering,
you know, we just say...

301
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,229
we got lost.

302
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,894
It's simple.

303
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,232
And this shit is current.

304
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,569
'Course it is. I mean,
why wouldn't it be?

305
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,574
You tellin' me
after 35 years

306
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,906
no one's found
this so-called safe?

307
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,480
Have you got anything else
better to do?

308
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,114
All right, Richie-Rich.
I'm down.

309
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,942
What?

310
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:49,946
I'm working.

311
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,516
I didn't say anything.

312
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,884
I'm glad you were cleared
for this project, Christine.

313
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,320
Out of everyone here,

314
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,449
I think you've got
the most potential.

315
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,787
Do you, now?

316
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:04,021
I've seen everyone's file.

317
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,927
I know your story.

318
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,398
Why you attacked
your stepfather...

319
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,968
what happened
to your sister.

320
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:12,864
You got a shitty deal.

321
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,536
Yeah.

322
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:22,809
Actually, speaking
of shitty deals...

323
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,940
whose bright idea was it
to put Kira and Michael

324
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,643
on this project together?

325
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:27,912
What are you talkin' about?

326
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,080
What I'm talking about

327
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,157
is Kira used
to work for that prick

328
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,158
- out on the streets.
- What?

329
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,058
Yeah... when he wasn't
beating her ass.

330
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:41,494
She rolled over on him,
and now because of you guys,

331
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,727
he's here, and he's been
fuckin' stalking her

332
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:44,996
- the whole time.
- Okay.

333
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:47,231
Okay. We didn't know.

334
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,298
I'll deal with it.

335
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:54,913
Yeah. You deal with it.

336
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,846
You'd get with her?

337
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,251
Absolutely.

338
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,690
What, you wouldn't?

339
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,760
Man, your standards
are too high.

340
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,363
What's up, bitch?

341
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:15,298
- I mean, uh... Rich.
- Come on.

342
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:16,595
You didn't stick your tongue
in this, did you?

343
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,169
Yes, as a matter of fact.

344
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:24,234
I specifically asked
for no meat.

345
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:28,938
The granola girl's
on a rampage.

346
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:31,778
Shoulda left her tofu-munching
ass back in County.

347
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,220
Hey, uh, you want
my potato salad?

348
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,687
Oh, that's sweet.
Thanks.

349
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,020
"That's sweet. Thanks."

350
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:44,891
Ass.

351
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,166
Oh, the poor thing.

352
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,599
Here. Come here, puppy.
Want some food?

353
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,674
Here you go.

354
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,573
Fucking moron!

355
00:22:58,677 --> 00:22:59,735
What?

356
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:02,814
- He's starving!
- What?

357
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,746
It's a fucking stray dog.
Who gives as shit?

358
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:15,494
She wasn't that fat.

359
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,993
You got that shit?

360
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:23,291
Hey. How about
a peace offering?

361
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,097
You can pimp it up
in the penthouse.

362
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,431
Home-grown aspirin?

363
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,270
Hell, yeah.

364
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,202
How about it, granola girl?

365
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:35,610
It's organic.

366
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:38,310
Bring it on.

367
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:50,553
Hey.

368
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,392
Do you think,

369
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:55,558
veggie girl...
you know...

370
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:57,533
likes tube steak?

371
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:58,603
Dude.

372
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:00,296
You'll never know,
will you?

373
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,874
But I'll let you smell
my fingers later.

374
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,572
You two
aren't partying?

375
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,841
Pussies.

376
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:21,317
Rich pussies.

377
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:27,065
This better work,
Richie-Rich.

378
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,584
Michael?

379
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,625
You asshole.

380
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,003
How the fuck did
you get in here?

381
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,199
You should be
used to me comin'

382
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,571
through the back door.

383
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,770
Get out!
Get the fuck outta here!

384
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:47,971
Jesus Christ, bitch...

385
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,411
No! Get out now!

386
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,209
Hey! Let her go!

387
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,786
And what if I don't?

388
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,218
I said...

389
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:58,847
fucking let her go. Now.

390
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:08,065
You bitches.

391
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:12,600
Fucking asshole.

392
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:13,672
You okay?

393
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,597
Are you okay?
Did he hurt you?

394
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:22,514
I'm sorry.

395
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:36,695
This one.

396
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,362
Damn. It's locked.

397
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,965
Nice.

398
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,154
Wow. All this for Russell?

399
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,559
He's interested in my views.

400
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,890
<i>Is that why he keeps
lookin' at your ass?</i>

401
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,256
My girl even shaved
her furry legs for this guy.

402
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:18,794
Yeah, well, I was
getting a little sick

403
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,394
of the natural look anyway.

404
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:23,236
If lookin' like a Hobbit is natural.

405
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,078
So, you guys coming?

406
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:34,281
Come on. Let's go.

407
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:46,459
Thanks.

408
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:48,924
Nice rock.

409
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,101
Thank you.

410
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,272
Why is it on your right hand?

411
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:58,800
I'm, test-driving it.

412
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:02,776
I haven't given him
an answer yet.

413
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,381
Why?

414
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:07,679
He's decent, right?

415
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,286
Yeah.

416
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:12,186
Got all his own teeth?

417
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:14,054
Yeah.

418
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:17,489
What are you waiting for?

419
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,866
Man! You... you smell that?

420
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,404
Bet no one's been up here
since the fire.

421
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:30,168
I think you're wrong, dawg.

422
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,800
Yeah. Yeah,
maybe I'm wrong.

423
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,410
Why would they leave
all this here?

424
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,851
Maybe they found
the safe,

425
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:45,150
got rich, and didn't
need this shit no more.

426
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,756
Check him out.

427
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,458
Yeah.

428
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,261
He's dead.

429
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:57,335
No shit.

430
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:58,869
Probably from the fire.

431
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,666
The fire was 30 years ago.

432
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,172
This guy's fresh.
He wasn't killed in the fuckin' fire.

433
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:04,902
Stop freakin' out
on me. All right?

434
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,446
Maybe he's got
some money on him.

435
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:09,878
You never know.

436
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,578
Where the fuck are his eyes?

437
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:24,289
Richie! Where
you goin'? Richie!

438
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,263
Richie!

439
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,009
What the h...

440
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:46,050
Richie! Where
the hell are you?

441
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,718
Richie!

442
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:07,799
Help!

443
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,302
Help!

444
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:13,778
No!

445
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,972
Help me! Please!

446
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:31,960
There's someone
in the elevator.

447
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:33,588
They must've
left their rooms.

448
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:35,964
I'll get this one.

449
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:11,297
I guess I'm not
waiting on anything.

450
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:22,905
Come on.

451
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,791
Hello?

452
00:31:34,826 --> 00:31:35,793
Anybody here?

453
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,009
So, why didn't
Christina come?

454
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,982
I don't know. She probably
wanted to make out with Kira.

455
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,986
Why do homeless people
live here? It's disgusting.

456
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,915
What's that?

457
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:41,390
Opportunity knocking.

458
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,122
Or granny and her vibrator.

459
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:45,821
That was pathetic.

460
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:52,070
He's only gonna get worse.

461
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,567
I gotta get outta here.

462
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:03,706
The windows
in the kitchen

463
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,009
face out toward
the atrium.

464
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,175
Yeah, but don't they have...

465
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,081
No. No bars.

466
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,088
There's an opening
in the wall.

467
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,088
It's gotta lead
somewhere, right?

468
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:20,098
Dog got out.

469
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,437
Okay. I'll stay out here.

470
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:36,912
The hole's
on the far wall

471
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,209
in the atrium.

472
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,841
If you stay low,
you should make it.

473
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,510
I wish you'd
come with me.

474
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:43,588
Just go.

475
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,451
- Okay.
- Okay?

476
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,119
Be careful.

477
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,498
Okay, go.

478
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,391
The kitchen.

479
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:05,526
What happened?

480
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:08,936
I'm okay.
Just keep Williams out.

481
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,268
Right.

482
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,870
Michael?

483
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:17,448
Why can't you
just leave me al...

484
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,449
Shit.

485
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:47,443
- Damn it.
- Kira!

486
00:35:51,216 --> 00:35:52,183
Help!

487
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,784
Where does this lead to?

488
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,014
It goes to every floor.

489
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,522
Who else is in the hotel?

490
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:02,149
Nobody. We cleared the homeless
out before you got here.

491
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,558
Go make sure everybody else
is still in their rooms.

492
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:07,188
Wait! Everyone else
went to the penthouses.

493
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:08,766
- That's off limits!
- Damn it!

494
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:20,476
Shit.

495
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:23,639
Call 911. Anyone comes down,
get 'em out of the building fast.

496
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,272
I'm coming with you.

497
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,544
Forget it. You wait
here for Hannah.

498
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,383
What are you doin'?

499
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:35,857
I said I'm coming with you.

500
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,792
Come on, hurry up!

501
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,400
What happened to you?

502
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,468
What?

503
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:49,004
Nothing. That...
that's not even my...

504
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,574
What the fuck is going on?

505
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:02,850
Anyone for some
interior redecorating?

506
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:04,251
Oh, shit!

507
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:06,756
You're gonna get us
caught, asshole!

508
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,189
Fuck.

509
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:12,690
By who? Captain Hook?

510
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,837
Hey!

511
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:27,504
Who needs therapy?

512
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:28,704
Fuck.

513
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:33,882
How many people
died up here?

514
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:42,352
Stay close.

515
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,531
Damn. Damn.

516
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:56,438
Damn. Where in the hell
are stairs?

517
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,138
Oh... shit!

518
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:11,019
Come on, baby.
Open up.

519
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,784
Come on.

520
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:21,224
He took Richie.

521
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,299
Calm down.

522
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,799
He took Richie!

523
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:24,869
What'd this guy look like?

524
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,561
Man, he's huge, man.

525
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:27,899
He has a long, long chain,

526
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,667
and a damn hole
in his head.

527
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:32,771
What?

528
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:35,436
No. It's not right.

529
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,508
It can't be him.
I shot him in the head.

530
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:42,347
Holy shit.

531
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,513
Wait a minute.
You shot that freak

532
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:46,749
that plucked all
those people's eyes out.

533
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:50,419
Whoa. Wait. What the hell
does he want with Kira?

534
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:51,586
I'm not sure.

535
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,794
The last time,
he killed all of his victims except one.

536
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,959
I think he was keepin' her

537
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,559
because she had tattoos.

538
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:03,198
Stuff like crosses...
religious markings.

539
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,935
Kira has religious tattoos

540
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,010
Ohhh... damn.

541
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,976
You think he killed
everybody else?

542
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,740
Didn't Margaret
call the police?

543
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,475
I don't know that she could.

544
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:13,945
We gotta move.

545
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:17,455
He let the other woman live.

546
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,149
Take this.
Take the stairs.

547
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:21,225
Whatever you guys gotta do,

548
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:23,351
just get the fuck outta here.

549
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,621
I'm goin' after Kira.

550
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,726
Wait a minute!

551
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:30,232
Wait! You can't
do this alone!

552
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,360
You guys gotta go!

553
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,903
Williams!

554
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,608
Williams! Shit!

555
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,408
Williams!

556
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,013
Oh, my God!

557
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,641
Williams!

558
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,418
You think he got him?

559
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:54,355
Williams!

560
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:03,024
Shit!

561
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:06,467
Come on!
Christine, Come on!

562
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,538
We gotta go!

563
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,233
No! Come on!

564
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,177
Leave him alone!
Come on!

565
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,351
What the hell
are you doin'?

566
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,249
Sorry.

567
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:27,490
Come on!

568
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:31,788
Here. Take the Taser.

569
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:41,531
Far sweet.

570
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:52,975
Nice.

571
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:55,644
Could you imagine
cleaning up in here?

572
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,084
This could've been
a classy joint

573
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,489
back in the day.

574
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:03,891
What do you know
about class?

575
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,089
Oh my God.

576
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:09,360
This place is disgusting.

577
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:20,140
At least we got
the sacred herb.

578
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:21,576
Spark that shit.

579
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,483
Let's go.

580
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,489
And one for me.

581
00:41:35,193 --> 00:41:36,785
Try not to suck it all down.

582
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:43,129
So, you and Kira used
to be a thing, huh?

583
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,815
You know, you could do better.

584
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,350
Here you go.

585
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:22,729
I keep seeing things.

586
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,102
I told you
this shit is gold.

587
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,535
Let's find someplace private.

588
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,175
Oh, shit, you go girl!

589
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:36,185
Hey, wanna come?

590
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,154
Oh, my God.

591
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:57,574
Oh, God,
where are we going?

592
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:58,801
Seventh floor.

593
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,002
Why?

594
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,579
Lucky number?

595
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,704
The maid's quarters?

596
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,337
Romantic.

597
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,847
You know what they say.

598
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,043
Beggars can't be choosers.

599
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:43,279
Who's begging?

600
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,463
Richie? Richie?

601
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,614
Help!

602
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,887
Somebody...

603
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,807
What do you want?

604
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,284
What do you want?

605
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,895
Richie!

606
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,098
Richie!

607
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:45,604
No!

608
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:49,936
No!

609
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:53,175
Please... please.

610
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:05,587
Did you say something?

611
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,630
You know...

612
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,624
We're all alone up here.

613
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:23,044
You remember when I said
that you could do better than Kira?

614
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:30,386
Well, I didn't mean
this much better.

615
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,159
Oh, my God.
That's so pathetic.

616
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:39,821
My phone!

617
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:41,831
I'm having my sister up.

618
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:44,367
Where did you get a cell?

619
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,901
Duh, I took
it from Hannah.

620
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:47,868
Hey, bitch, what's up?

621
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:51,237
No, yeah, save
this number tonight.

622
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,207
This is the cell
that I'm using, okay?

623
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:56,280
Fuck this.

624
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:01,283
Oh my God, no, it's just this
total bonehead called Michael.

625
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:03,353
He thinks he's
such a badass.

626
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,387
<i>Do you see the sin?</i>

627
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,302
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

628
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:58,398
<i>Open your eyes and
wash the sins out.</i>

629
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,672
What ya got in here?

630
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,073
Russell, hold up.

631
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,546
What?

632
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,581
You're kidding, right?

633
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:48,652
No, wait.

634
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:51,244
There's something weird
about that mirror.

635
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:53,915
Let me up.

636
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:57,255
Mirror... I'll check it out.

637
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:04,861
Damn. You know what?

638
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:05,958
This is a two-way mirror.

639
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,367
What?

640
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:13,366
Get out! Go!

641
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,306
What the fuck was that?

642
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:55,950
No bars.

643
00:50:57,822 --> 00:50:59,881
We can get down to
the atrium from here.

644
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,617
Okay.

645
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,703
It's not tight enough.

646
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,710
It'll get tighter
when you hang on it.

647
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,404
I'll get stuck
on the glass roof.

648
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:25,948
Just kick it out.
You'll be fine.

649
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,642
Okay? You'll be fine.

650
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:36,789
Oh, God, I can't do this.

651
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:38,293
You have to.

652
00:51:41,632 --> 00:51:43,793
God.

653
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,583
Oh, God!
Russell, go slow.

654
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,483
Okay.

655
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:08,825
It's all right.

656
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:17,260
Russell, stop.

657
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,263
Russell? Russell!

658
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:28,877
Russell, what was that?

659
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,709
Russell, where are you?

660
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,840
Russell. Why are you
pulling me up?

661
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:35,878
Russell, stop.

662
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,654
No!

663
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:50,299
Stop! Let go!

664
00:52:50,401 --> 00:52:52,426
Let go of me!

665
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,295
Stop! Let me go!

666
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,878
Let me go.
Let me down.

667
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:13,286
Please let me down!

668
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:16,751
Let me go.

669
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:24,262
Let me go!

670
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:27,528
No!

671
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,432
Oh, God.

672
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:30,193
Tease.

673
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,428
Tease? Michael,
do you even have a car?

674
00:54:33,537 --> 00:54:35,471
You skank.

675
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:36,834
What the fuck?

676
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,043
It's stuck.

677
00:54:41,145 --> 00:54:42,271
Move.

678
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:47,446
It's stuck.

679
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,449
No shit.

680
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,213
God damn it.

681
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:55,083
Yeah, hang on a sec,
will you, just give me a second.

682
00:54:55,192 --> 00:54:57,956
So. Where's the
elevator, Columbus?

683
00:54:58,062 --> 00:54:59,962
Get off the phone.

684
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:01,122
No!

685
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:04,428
I'm not Kira, Mike.

686
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:08,869
Yeah, I don't know,
some really stupid hotel with a retard.

687
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:21,381
Oh, gross.
Where the hell are they coming from?

688
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:24,045
Oh, my God, shit.

689
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,626
Oh my God.

690
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:34,990
Shit. Fuck.

691
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:43,220
No!

692
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:44,555
Oh my God!

693
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:47,027
Oh, please, no!

694
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:51,964
Michael! Michael, please!

695
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:55,200
Help me!

696
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,801
Please, God!
Please help me!

697
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:03,977
<i>It's annoying...the sin.</i>

698
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:06,276
<i>Do you see the sin?</i>

699
00:58:12,256 --> 00:58:14,087
<i>Did you look at them?</i>

700
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,284
<i>Did you see the sin?</i>

701
00:58:16,393 --> 00:58:18,156
<i>Do you see their sin?</i>

702
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:20,457
<i>Look into their eyes.</i>

703
00:58:20,564 --> 00:58:22,191
Oh my God!

704
00:58:22,299 --> 00:58:25,132
<i>The eyes are
the window of the soul.</i>

705
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,133
Michael!

706
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:14,406
Come on, shit!

707
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:16,486
It won't fuckin' open!

708
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:21,515
What the fuck, man?

709
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:23,525
It doesn't matter, we're
going after Kira anyway.

710
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:26,523
He's coming.

711
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,325
We're trapped!

712
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:29,660
We're gonna fucking die!

713
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:30,994
Shoot him!

714
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:33,194
Fuck!

715
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,041
Michael?

716
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:42,703
Jesus Christ!

717
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:44,178
What's wrong with you idiots?

718
01:00:05,002 --> 01:00:06,435
What the hell is this?

719
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,663
Looks like some
kind of trip wire.

720
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:21,207
He took Richie
into the elevator.

721
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:38,595
All right, motherfucker.

722
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:51,708
Christine, come on!

723
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:55,074
Let's go, we gotta
get out of here!

724
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:00,013
- Michael!
- Come on!

725
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:08,325
Damn, he broke it!

726
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:12,133
Oh, shit!

727
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:14,066
What the fuck
are we gonna do now?

728
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,763
We gotta go up.

729
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:17,430
Hurry up!

730
01:01:21,578 --> 01:01:22,636
Shit!

731
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:25,738
Help me up!
Pull me up, come on!

732
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,612
Quick, grab my hand.

733
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,832
Go, come on, go.

734
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:48,029
Come on, go, go.

735
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,335
Come on, let's go this way.

736
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,536
Kira!

737
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:59,080
God.

738
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,649
Kira!

739
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,082
Shit, the other elevator.

740
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:04,118
Kira!

741
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,153
Help!

742
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:06,722
Come on.

743
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:07,812
Help me.

744
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:10,552
She's in here.

745
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:11,854
Shit.

746
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:15,958
Come on, Tye!

747
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:24,235
Holy shit.

748
01:02:24,341 --> 01:02:27,208
Look at all this money.

749
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,005
I'll be damn, Richie Rich.

750
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:31,478
It really was a safe.

751
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,548
Look at all this damn money.

752
01:02:34,551 --> 01:02:35,882
Oh my God.

753
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:37,817
Are these human eyes?

754
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:43,456
Help!

755
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,993
Kira?

756
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:48,763
Kira?

757
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,025
Help, please!

758
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:52,931
Tye, she's in here,
come on!

759
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:55,561
Come on, Tye.

760
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,573
Kira... are you in here?

761
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:03,703
Hurry!

762
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,288
Oh God, Christine,
get me out of here.

763
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:19,121
Move quick!

764
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:23,330
How?

765
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:24,331
The keys.

766
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:25,833
They're over there
on the table.

767
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:27,699
Richie.

768
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,431
He's coming, come on!

769
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,201
I gotta go.
I'm gonna come back, okay?

770
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,571
Don't leave me.

771
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,762
I wish you'd just kill me.

772
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,862
We gotta draw him out.

773
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:04,065
What do you mean
we gotta draw him out?

774
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:06,165
We gotta get his attention.
Make some noise or something.

775
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,805
Come on, Tye, this
is our only chance.

776
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:30,965
Oh, you pig!

777
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,638
You're sick.
You're fucking sick!

778
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,815
<i>You filthy little pig.</i>

779
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:49,680
<i>You enjoy this, don't you?</i>

780
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:51,515
<i>Oh, I can tell you do.</i>

781
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:53,282
<i>I see that.</i>

782
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,618
<i>I see what you're doing.</i>

783
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:55,554
<i>Stop it.</i>

784
01:05:04,768 --> 01:05:05,598
No.

785
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:13,832
Oh, no.

786
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:50,945
Okay, Kira.

787
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:54,377
Where are the keys?

788
01:05:54,484 --> 01:05:55,746
He took them.

789
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:00,756
Shit.

790
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:43,365
This'll work.

791
01:06:44,768 --> 01:06:46,292
Come on.

792
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:50,371
Hurry.

793
01:07:02,786 --> 01:07:04,651
Tye.

794
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:07,984
Hurry.

795
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,935
Open the cage!

796
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:24,899
Christine!

797
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:27,905
Shit.

798
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:37,177
Oh, Margaret, Margaret.
Thank God.

799
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:43,115
What are you
doing in there?

800
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:44,887
There's this guy,
and he's just...

801
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:46,518
Oh, shit.

802
01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:57,271
I'd like you to tell me.

803
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,898
Why is that whore still alive?

804
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:03,575
What? No.

805
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:07,376
Why is she still alive?

806
01:08:07,484 --> 01:08:08,075
You know him?

807
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:12,177
Know him?
He's my son.

808
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:15,849
He's the hand of God.

809
01:08:15,959 --> 01:08:17,017
You got us here
to help you.

810
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,658
Help me?

811
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:21,525
No. Williams was
the one I wanted.

812
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,189
Found him.

813
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,697
He hurt my boy.

814
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:31,535
You were a bonus.

815
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:32,801
Why here?

816
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:35,878
What better place
to do God's work?

817
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:38,812
<i>The hotel caters deviants, sinners,</i>

818
01:08:38,915 --> 01:08:40,610
<i>and the ones
that hear voices.</i>

819
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:43,550
There's only one
voice to hear.

820
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:45,450
And that's the voice of God.

821
01:08:45,555 --> 01:08:47,989
And He's told you what to do!

822
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:55,954
Are you fucking insane!

823
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:58,431
This is not what God wants!

824
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:00,366
Don't you see... the tattoos.

825
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,870
Don't you see the sin?
The tattoos are blasphemy.

826
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:03,904
Don't you see it?

827
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:10,410
She doesn't know God.
Don't you see it?

828
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:11,741
Don't you see the sin?

829
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:13,748
You understand, don't you?

830
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,784
That's why you killed the others.
Now it's her turn.

831
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:17,216
Judge her.

832
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,048
No.

833
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,382
Judge her.

834
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:20,888
- No.
- Judge her.

835
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,151
Open your eyes.
Judge her.

836
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,625
And wash the sins out.
Judge her.

837
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:26,990
Once your soul's clean,

838
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,496
you'll be the hand of God.

839
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:30,497
- No.
- Judge her.

840
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,761
No!

841
01:09:36,806 --> 01:09:38,034
Fine.

842
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,199
I'll do it for you.

843
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:43,175
Oh, shit!

844
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,540
Because I can see.

845
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:49,010
Oh, please, no!

846
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,847
Please, God, help!

847
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:52,581
No!

848
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,054
And I...

849
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,054
will not fail God.

850
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,020
Jacob!

851
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:00,755
What are you doing?
Let me go!

852
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,330
Let go!

853
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:04,525
You ungrateful bastard!

854
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:05,965
You hear me?

855
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:07,730
Don't you see the sin?

856
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,615
I want my mama.

857
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:30,849
- Please!
- You brought this home?

858
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:31,858
Don't you see
what she is?

859
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:33,053
Look at her.
Look at her.

860
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:34,629
Look at her!

861
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,358
Damn you!

862
01:10:36,466 --> 01:10:37,831
Let go!

863
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:39,026
You ungrateful bastard!

864
01:10:39,135 --> 01:10:40,363
Haven't you learned anything?

865
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:43,260
Bastard, you hear me?

866
01:10:43,373 --> 01:10:45,807
Don't you see the evil
in her eyes?

867
01:10:53,516 --> 01:10:54,107
No, no!

868
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:56,578
You don't see it?

869
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:59,120
Maybe you just need to take
a closer look at them.

870
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:06,595
Look! Look at it.

871
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:07,628
See that?

872
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,357
Have a good look at it.

873
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:11,126
Look.

874
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:30,250
I see it.

875
01:11:30,353 --> 01:11:31,285
What?

876
01:11:55,378 --> 01:11:57,039
Please, no!

877
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,444
You don't have to do this.

878
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:10,316
No! No!

879
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:15,561
No!

880
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:45,487
Christine?

881
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:46,782
He's out of it.

882
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,117
Can you move?

883
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:58,132
Okay.

884
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:22,488
Come on, Christine.

885
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:24,082
Do it!

886
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:25,490
Shoot him!

887
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,097
Michael!

888
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:07,965
Come on, let's go!

889
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:15,644
Run!

890
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:27,823
In here!

891
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,309
Christine!

892
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:55,179
Michael. Michael.

893
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,189
Michael!

894
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:37,486
Watch out!

895
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:52,968
You okay?

896
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,043
Yeah.

897
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,383
No!

898
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:07,620
No!

899
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:09,088
Fall, you prick!

900
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:10,283
No!

901
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:13,753
No!

902
01:17:23,339 --> 01:17:24,966
Fuck you!

903
01:18:34,176 --> 01:18:35,973
Let's go.

904
01:18:57,032 --> 01:19:01,492
Michael, you didn't have
to come back for us.

905
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:06,704
I didn't want to walk
out of here alone.
