1
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,088
(Peter Arnett)
You may hear the bombs now.

2
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,091
if you're still with us,
you can hear the bombs now.

3
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,377
They are hitting the centre of the city.

4
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,779
(second reporter)
Now we can hear explosions...

5
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,138
..off in the distance
to the west of central Baghdad.

6
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,336
Clearly l've never been there,...

7
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,208
..but this feels like
we're in the centre of hell.

8
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,933
(radio chatter)

9
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,813
(President Bush) The 28 countries...

10
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,333
..with forces in the Gulf area...

11
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,173
..have exhausted all reasonable efforts...

12
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,569
..to reach a peaceful resolution,...

13
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,979
..have no choice...

14
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,211
..but to drive Saddam
from Kuwait by force.

15
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,729
(lraqi spokesman)
A great battle has been initiated.

16
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,015
The mother of all battles.

17
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,374
(Bush) Our objectives...

18
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,735
..in the Persian Gulf are clear,...

19
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,970
..our goals defined.

20
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,018
lraq must withdraw from Kuwait...

21
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,375
..completely, immediately,...

22
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,291
..and without condition.

23
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,895
(Bush) The liberation of Kuwait...

24
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,777
..has now entered a final phase.

25
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,648
l have therefore directed
to use all forces available,...

26
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,571
..including ground forces,...

27
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,538
..to eject the lraqi army from Kuwait.

28
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,697
(Peter Arnett)
At this point it seems inevitable...

29
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,248
..that the ground war is only hours away.

30
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,649
Peter Arnett, Baghdad.

31
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,569
Don't ever for one minute
underestimate the enemy,...

32
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,537
..but remember, we're better soldiers.

33
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,057
We're fighting with better equipment,
we're better trained and a lot smarter.

34
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,689
Sleep deprivation.
Our soldiers been up 46, 48 hours,...

35
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,169
..so stay on top of 'em.
Maintain your intervals.

36
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,136
Any questions?

37
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,377
Let's have a little prayer.

38
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,530
Dear God, protect us...

39
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,657
..as we protect our country
we so dearly love.

40
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,699
Keep us safe that we'll all get home
to see our families and our children.

41
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:08,656
Amen.

42
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,048
Amen.

43
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,094
- Let's kill 'em all.
- (all) Hu-ah!

44
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:26,970
You all right, Boylar?

45
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,617
Hell, yeah.

46
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,414
- Let's heat 'em up, Nat.
- See you in Baghdad.

47
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,292
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,291
(engines starting)

49
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,853
Battle-carry Sabot.

50
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,377
Sabot bullet coming up, sir.

51
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,659

52

- Driver ready.
- Loader ready.

54
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,529
Gunner ready to give Saddam
a new way to hurt.

55
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,496
- Hu-ah!
- Hu-ah!

56
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,490
Hu-ah.

57
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,094
All right, Boylar?

58
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,249
Roger that.

59
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,252
All Cougar elements, this is Cougar-6.
Report Red Con 1. Over.

60
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,976

Move out.

62
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,177
(radio chatter)

63
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,336
Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.

64
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,773
No joy over here.

65
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,976
Permission to try an alternate route. Over.

66
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,177
Roger that, Cougar-6.
Work your way to phase line hammer.

67
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,728

70
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,894
- All right.
- Hold on. They got no range.

71
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,254
2,500 metres and closing, sir.

72
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,853
Ready to lase and blaze.

73
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,539
Contact, sir. He's in range.

74
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,929
- Come on, let me kill his ass.
- Fire!

75
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,215
On the way!

76
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,329
Yeah! Yeah!

77
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,012
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

78
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,694

(Patella) Got him! We got him!

82
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,859
Sabre-6, Liberty-6.

83
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,896
We got enemy tangos retreating...

84
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,289
..vicinity grid 2-4-9er-8.

85
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,611
Your pursuit should intercept
their retreat, grid 7-6-5.

86
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,258
Roger that, Liberty-6.

87
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,331
- Troops!
- Troops!

88
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,778
Cease fire! Cease fire!

89
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,813
(shouting in Arabic)

90
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,299
Come on! Come on!

91
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,739
Sabre-6, this is Cougar-6.

92
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,969
Go ahead, Cougar-6.

93
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,335
l have got mines. Repeat, mines.

94
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,058
l gotta get the fuck out of here.

95
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,495
(Nat) Work your way to grid line Charlie.

96
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,334
Cougar-6 to all Cougar elements.
Let's get the hell out of here.

97
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,576
(shouting in Arabic)

98
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,453
Whoa! What the...

99
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,252
Oh, shit!

100
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,410
All Sabre units, this is Sabre-6.

101
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,219
We just lost a tank.
Anybody see the shooter?

102
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,814
- l didn't see anything.
- Where they coming from?

103
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,692
Who the hell is shooting at us?

104
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,213
Liberty-6, we got enemy tanks...

105
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,052
..retreating grid 7-6...

106
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,210
- Patella, that one of our tanks?
- Hard to tell.

107
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,528
Make it out, and fast!

108
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,500
Oh, shit! We're almost browning out.

109
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,059
Nat, what's happening?

110
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,018
Liberty-6, we got enemy tanks on our flank.
We have contact.

111
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,055
This is Cougar-6.

112
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,813
Enemy tangos at phase line delta. Over.

113
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,936
- Patella, find me a target.
- l think l got one, sir.

114
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,738
Do you or do you not have a target?

115
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,616
l think so!

116
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,769
Gunner, Sabot, tank.

117
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,815
ldentify! Up!

118
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,889
Fire!

119
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,453
He just fired, sir.

120
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,575
They're firing at us!

121
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,969
- Loader!
- Up, sir!

122
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,970
Fire!

123
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,454
Yeah! That's the one!

124
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,495
All right.

125
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,969
(radio) Sabre-6, we just lost Cougar-6.

126
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,051
- We got him.
- Sabre, you just lit up a friendly!

127
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,459
l heard you! We... what?

128
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,939
Oh, my God.

129
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,215
You just lit up Boylar, goddamn it!

130
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,894
(radio) Sabre-6, Nat, what's happening?

131
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,379
Patella, was that one of our tanks?

132
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,530
He fired, sir.

133
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,451
At us or at the T-72s?

134
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,450
l don't know.

135
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,770
At us or at the T-72s?

136
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,975
l don't know!

137
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,016
(Patella) Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

138
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,375
(radio) Colonel Serling, report status now.

139
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,859
(explosion)

140
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,498
They have range on us, sir.

141
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,571
Sir!

142
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,892
Oh, Christ, Colonel...

143
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,574
l gave the order to fire.

144
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,698
So with your thermal equipment,...

145
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,534
..confused by burning tanks
and smoke obscuring your visual lD,...

146
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,977
..you couldn't tell the difference
between the T-54 and the Abrams.

147
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,891
l believe that, uh, we...

148
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,369
l should have known the difference,...

149
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,657
..even with the night scope.

150
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,776
lf we weren't under attack,...

151
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,729
But, under the circumstances,
there was no way to tell the difference.

152
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,973
Under the circumstances,...

153
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,369
..l suppose there was
no way to tell the difference, but...

154
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,178
There was no way to tell the difference.

155
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,454
Thank you, Colonel.

156
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,619
That's all we need.

157
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,931
(Patella) We're almost browning out!

158
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,172
(Boylar) We got enemy tanks on our flank.
We have contact.

159
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,488
Aah!

160
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,172
We just lost Cougar-6!

161
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,410
You just lit up a friendly!

162
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,489
(knock on door)

163
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,569
Colonel Serling?

164
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,570
Yes.

165
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,015
You OK? Can l get you something?

166
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,374
Yes, l'm fine. Fine.

167
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,418
Uh, yes, you can get me a cup of coffee.

168
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,728
You got it.

169
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,857
We missed you and Meredith
at Banacek's party last night.

170
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,374
l'm too old to dance with you youngsters.

171
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,133
Meredith's not,
so tell her to come without you next time.

172
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,211
Oh, OK. l will do just that...

173
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,210
..next time.

174
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,178
(telephone rings)

175
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,249
Colonel Serling.

176
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,332
- Hershberg in five. Coffee's coming.
- Thanks.

177
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,409
Yes.

178
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,173
Washington Post?

179
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,175
About?

180
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,573
Yes, l was there.

181
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,935
That's a matter of public record.

182
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,293
Well, thank you very much, Mr...

183
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,532
Gartner. Thank you, Mr Gartner,
but l have nothing to say.

184
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,609
No, sir.

185
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,929
No, sir!

186
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,615
Well, l'll do just that.

187
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,815
Right.

188
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,289
Colonel Serling's here, sir.

189
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,335
Ban.

190
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,095
l'm not talking to you.
Won't even come to my anniversary party?

191
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,614
You and Sylvia have been together,
what, a month?

192
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,136
The way she danced with that marine,
it won't last another week.

193
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,131
lt may be my last anniversary party.

194
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,853
Were you there for me?

195
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,578
What's up?

196
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,295
Hey, Nat.

197
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,132
l've got to talk to you.

198
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,335
How we holding, Ban?

199
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,648
Running late, sir.

200
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,935
- May l run a few things by you, sir?
- Quickly.

201
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,055
Lieutenant Boylar's parents...

202
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,050
Boylar?

203
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,052
Tom Boylar. He died in Al Bathra.

204
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,619
He'd been with me a long time.

205
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,498
- From Virginia, right?
- Roger that, sir.

206
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,730
His parents have written to me.
They're hearing rumours.

207
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,732
You know we can't discuss it.
You have to put them off.

208
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,050
- Yes, sir, but...
- Tell them he died in action.

209
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,735
- He's a hero. That's all they want to know.
- Roger, but it's notjust his parents.

210
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,935
We got a call...

211
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,931
..from the Washington Post.

212
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,248
A reporter named Gartner.

213
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,773
A reporter called you about Al Bathra?

214
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,975
You didn't talk?

215
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,970
Of course not.

216
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,779
Nobody'll hang you out to dry.
l won't let 'em.

217
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,088
Did you listen to the tape, sir?

218
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,619
Colonel, the war's over.

219
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,613
You and l have been given
the great responsibility and privilege...

220
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,533
..of investigating combat medals
for our army.

221
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,770
ln other words, we've been passed over.

222
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,778
l prefer to think of it
as a second chance, Nat.

223
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,816
We understand each other?

224
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,855
Yes, sir.

225
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,339
OK.

226
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:46,777
The White House heard we're considering
the Medal of Honour for a chopper pilot...

227
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,373
..who saved some guys
on a downed Blackhawk.

228
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,338
- Naturally they want it for Veterans Day.
- Naturally.

229
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,332
Which is why
you're taking over the inquiry.

230
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,015
We've got the rescued soldiers
in there for debriefing.

231
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,339
Attention.

232
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,371
Morning. Take your seats.

233
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,575
Everything in order?

234
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,097
- Just going over the sequence of events.
- Bring Colonel Serling up to speed.

235
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,090
Morning, sir.

236
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,454
Good to see you again.

237
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,815
Could we get a picture
of you and the survivors?

238
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,379
No, thank you.

239
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,735
- Keep me in the loop.
- Thank you, sir.

240
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,971
- Morning.
- Morning.

241
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,848
Doug Bruno, White House.
Do everything my way and we'll be fine.

242
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,814
Nat Serling.

243
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,368
l'll, uh, get out of your way.

244
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,575
- Major.
- Sir.

245
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,857
25 February,
these men were part of a refuelling convoy.

246
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,296
Their Blackhawk was shot down
by an SA-7 west of Al Kufan.

247
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,452
Five seconds after it locked on,
we were down.

248
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,215
- We didn't know what hit us.
- Our lines were surrounding them so fast,...

249
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,530
..we got caught in a pocket of resistance.

250
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,694
lraqi ground troops on the ridge above
kept them completely pinned down.

251
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,532
Did you discuss surrendering?

252
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,937
Yes, sir, we did.

253
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,215
We were all wounded one way or another.

254
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,337
We weren't trained
for that kind of situation, sir.

255
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,411
Don't have to make excuses to me.

256
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,899
Go on, Sam.

257
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,857
That's all we got so far, sir.

258
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,498
OK.

259
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,730
- Lieutenant Chelli.
- Yes, sir.

260
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,893
Well,
as if things weren't bad enough already,...

261
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,936
..one of their T-54s...

262
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,615
..joins the ragheads up on the ridge.

263
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,418
(tank engine)

264
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,174
lncoming! Get down!

265
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,011
That round
kills the medic, Relleno, Gerspach,...

266
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,773
..and, uh, Egan here lost his leg.

267
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,090
So we figure that's it. We're dead.

268
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,818
But then we hear it.

269
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,016
Nothing like the sound of an inbound Huey.

270
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,249
(helicopter)

271
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,534
Yeah!

272
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,496
Yeah!

273
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,211
(Serling) This Huey, did it take any fire?

274
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,335
Right off the bat.

275
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,254
But this time
when the Huey comes back, it returns fire.

276
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,978
Ground troops go for cover.

277
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,370
Then the Huey circles back over the tank...

278
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,577
That's when
they threw something overboard.

279
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,415
- Threw something, or something fell off?
- l couldn't tell, but the tank blew.

280
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,894
Oh!

281
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,208
Yeah!

282
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,858
Man, did it ever blow!

283
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,372
We, uh, we never did see
what knocked the Huey down.

284
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,098
(explosion)

285
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,171
We couldn't see the crash.

286
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,010
That night we caught sporadic ground fire.

287
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,456
The Huey was down below,
between us and the enemy,...

288
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,576
..so they caught most of it.

289
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,094
Any communications
between you and them?

290
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,489
No, sir. As l said, our radio was wasted.

291
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,889
Shouting just draws enemy fire.

292
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,815
So the lraqis,
they start to close in on the Huey...

293
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,333
..under cover fire,...

294
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,809
..and the Huey returns fire.

295
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,688
We figure it's all over,
and that's when we hear the rescue team.

296
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,213
Cobras, Hueys...

297
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,370
And a big-ass A-10 Thunderbolt.

298
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,136
l swear l never heard such a sweet sound.

299
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,176
But now the fuckers are...

300
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,819
l'm sorry, sir.

301
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,414
The lraqis are letting loose with all they got.

302
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,253
- You were right the first time.
- (laughter)

303
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,572
Plus the Huey crew is still banging away.

304
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,413
We load our wounded aboard,...

305
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,697
..and that's when
somebody decided to leave the dead.

306
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,771
l guess it was the commander of the rescue.

307
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,770
Mm-hmm.

308
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,452
And this... Huey crew,...

309
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,419
.they, uh, they returned fire
all through the final rescue?

310
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,297
Yes, sir. l... l think so.

311
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,769
l couldn't see much, though.

312
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,770
l heard it.

313
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,330
Nothing else sounds like an M-16.
Not no A-K or M-60.

314
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,695
l heard it, too.

315
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,808
The last thing we see is the Thunderbolt
dropping napalm on the downed choppers.

316
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,937
l don't know if it was Captain Walden...

317
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,409
..but that Huey...

318
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,819
..saved our lives.

319
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,939
lt sure sounds like it.

320
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,131
OK.

321
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,090
Thank you for your help.
l'll look over your statements.

322
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,329
Thank you, sir.

323
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,012
Thank you, Colonel.

324
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,169
That'll be all.

325
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,171
- Got something for me?
- l do, sir.

326
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,013
Walden's 201 file. Evaluation reports.

327
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,853
You know l'm going to need
background on these guys.

328
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,933
Make sure we don't have a wife-beater
or an illegal alien or gays.

329
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,339
That'll blow it.

330
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,570
About this Congressional Medal of Honour.

331
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,778
lt's not the Congressional Medal of Honour.
lt's just the Medal of Honour.

332
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,975
Tell that to Congress.

333
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,096
lf Captain Walden wins this medal...

334
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,489
You don't win it. You, uh, receive it.

335
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,093
lt's not a contest.

336
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,740
But that is perfect. That is why l'm here.

337
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,857
l'm not here
to get down your throat, make you crazy,...

338
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,896
..take these facts and twist them.

339
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,768
l just want to get these nuances out
of your head and to get it straight from you.

340
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,215
- lt's a woman.
- You didn't know?

341
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,212
What did you think the hoopla was about?

342
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,098
Banacek's got information
on three of Walden's men.

343
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,378
- The crew chief we're still tracking.
- This is Captain Karen Emma Walden.

344
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,898
She's the first woman ever to be nominated
for a Medal of Honour for combat.

345
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,299
l mean, this is gold.

346
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,733
lt's gold.

347
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,170
Unfortunately it's posthumous,...

348
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,455
..but l've got her little daughter.

349
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,974
l got the President of the United States.

350
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,255
lt's all set in the Rose Garden.

351
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,618
The President's going to lean down and
hang that ribbon round that pretty face.

352
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,818
There is not going to be
a dry eye from Nashua to Sacramento.

353
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,936
Excuse us.

354
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,577
OK, it was 5 to 1,...

355
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,412
..hook shot.

356
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,650
Me and her are cheerleaders.

357
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,016
- More mashed potatoes.
- (woman) Sorry, no more potatoes,...

358
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,739
..but how about some bread?

359
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,539
Aah!

360
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,258
(Boylar) Aah!

361
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,900
Daddy, can l have your mashed potatoes?

362
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,574
Daddy?

363
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,616
Sir?

364
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,537
Can l have your mashed potatoes?

365
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,491
M... Yeah. Sure.

366
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,013
Yeah,...

367
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,579
..soldier.

368
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,775
You want 'em all?

369
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,771
(telephone rings)

370
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,009
That enough?

371
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,490
More?

372
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,930
Hello?

373
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,897
Yes.

374
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,175
Uh, who is calling, please?

375
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,579
Just a minute.

376
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,335
lt's for you.

377
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,330
Who is it?

378
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,853
Somebody Gartner.

379
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,210
Want some more peas?

380
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,495
Excuse me.

381
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,537
Where are you going?

382
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,735
Fort Hood.

383
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,859
General Hershberg's got me investigating
a Medal of Honour.

384
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,817
lt's a woman.

385
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,413
Good for her.

386
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,569
Posthumous.

387
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,810
Too bad, but still good for her.

388
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,016
Mmm. Too bad.

389
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,736
You talk to the investigators today?

390
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,809
Right.

391
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,011
lt's all right, isn't it, Nat?

392
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,779
Yeah. Fine.

393
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,058
How long are you gone for?

394
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,573
Couple of days.

395
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,336
Then why are you emptying
your sock drawer?

396
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,496
l may be gone more than a couple of days.

397
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,289
Nat.

398
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,495
Yes.

399
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,096
l don't know what's happening.

400
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,772
Everything's fine.

401
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,373
l'm handling it.

402
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,576
(Nat) Mr Rady,
you were Captain Walden's copilot.

403
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,536
That's right.

404
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,374
(Nat) Can you tell me
what you remember about Al Kufan?

405
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,539
l remember the earth.

406
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,457
l remember... llario's face.

407
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,017
l wish...

408
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,369
- She hadn't needed to be a hero so bad.
- That's not fair.

409
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,690
We were just doing ourjob.

410
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,772
lt's not Ren's fault l got hit.

411
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,614
She sure as hell saved the lives
of those guys on the Blackhawk.

412
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,657
- You always defend her.
- Why didn't you like her?

413
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,332
She was so butch.

414
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,773
Honey, shut up.

415
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,452
She was, you know.

416
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,692
One of those women
who want to be officers...

417
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,611
Annie, shut up.

418
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,495
She gave her life for those men.

419
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,059
She was a soldier.

420
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,015
There she blows.

421
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,613
(gunfire)

422
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,490
- We're taking fire!
- Holy shit!

423
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,135
- Kill that motherfucker, Monfriez!
- l may as well be pissing on him.

424
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,212
- We need a fucking air strike!
- We got no fucking bomb!

425
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,130
- Making another pass, Ren?
- Yep.

426
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,417
No! We should go for altitude,
and call for support.

427
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,979
After we slow down that tank!

428
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,538
- How we gonna do that?
- Shut up and listen, soldier!

429
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,771
Altameyer,
unhook the aux fuel bladder port side.

430
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,578
Get ready to push it overboard.

431
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,979
Push it overboard, ma'am?

432
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,016
llario, unhook the flare gun!

433
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,135
What the fuck...

434
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,778
Do it!

435
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,816
lt's a bomb, asshole!

436
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,539
Target coming up!

437
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,009
Gimme more!

438
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,294
Ready here!

439
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,415
- Got it?
- l got it!

440
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,735
- Tell us when you're there! He'll kick it!
- Allow for the speed of the craft!

441
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,653
- The pod will drop at the same velocity!
- He knows.

442
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,054
Pick your moment!

443
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,936
Now!

444
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,413
(cheering)

445
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,811
Oh, my God!

446
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,375
Oh!

447
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,008
Whoa! Shit!

448
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,091
Whoa! Oh, God!

449
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,296
Hang on, llario! Grab ahold of me!

450
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,779
Don't let go of me! Pull me in!

451
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,977
Hang on.
Come on, llario! Pull yourself up!

452
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,698
Do something!

453
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,056
No! No! Rady, call in a Mayday!

454
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,654
llario,... call it in!

455
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,098
(lario)
Mayday! Dustoff-3... we are going down!

456
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,454
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!

457
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,735
We're going down! Mayday! Mayday!

458
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,889
This is Dustoff-3!

459
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,891
We're going down! We're going down!

460
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,777
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!

461
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,770
We are going down!

462
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,250
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!
We're going down! We're going down!

463
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,137
We're going down! Oh, my God...

464
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,569
That's it.

465
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,816
l woke up three days later
on a hospital ship.

466
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,492
Nearly bought it, that's sure.

467
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,979
(Larry King) When did you decide
the type of career in the Army you wanted?

468
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,372
(Schwarzkopf) That happened about
my third year at West Point when l was...

469
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,849
l could have gone in the Air Force.

470
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,817
l stood high enough in my class.

471
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,654
You can't get away from that guy.
He's everywhere.

472
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,413
- Hell of a soldier, though.
- You think so?

473
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,899
l know so.

474
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,413
Really. How?

475
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,855
l was with him in the Gulf.

476
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,850
No shit.

477
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,898
- Doing what?
- Armoured cavalry.

478
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,208
Hu-ah.

479
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,938
Hu-ah.

480
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,693
Once upon a time,
l was humping in the delta.

481
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,736
- With who?
- The 9th.

482
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,459
- You kicked some serious butt.
- That's right.

483
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,100
- One for my friend...
- Colonel Nat Serling.

484
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,968
Make it a double for Colonel Serling.
Tony Gartner, Washington Post.

485
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,529
They won't find any criminal culpability
in the Al Bathra incident.

486
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,133
You got nothing to worry about.

487
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,619
Those were my men.

488
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,850
l put that badly. l'm sorry.

489
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,569
Look, l went to Virginia
and spoke with Mr and Mrs Boylar.

490
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,014
You what?

491
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,059
l'm sorry, but they got a right
to know what happened to their son.

492
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,689
l'll take that.

493
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,811
(steam hissing)

494
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,493
(Serling) And this Huey crew, they, uh,
returned fire all through the final rescue?

495
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,013
(Chelli) Yes, sir. l think so.

496
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,328
l couldn't see much.

497
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,059
(Thompson) l heard it.
Nothing else sounds like an M-16.

498
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,209
Not no A-K or M-60.

499
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,733
(Egan) l heard it, too.

500
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,335
(Chelli) Last thing we see
is the Thunderbolt dropping napalm...

501
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,251
..on the two downed choppers.

502
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,976
(screaming)

503
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,849
Oh!

504
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,250
Sir!

505
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,373
All right, this is antifungal cream,...

506
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,339
..but to kill the athlete's foot when
you're in the shower, just piss on your feet.

507
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,489
That's disgusting.

508
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,616
What've you got for me today?

509
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,820
You want to get rid of the allergies to
bee pollen, then no caffeine, no chocolate.

510
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,460
Jesus. l give up coffee,
you can bury me now.

511
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,337
(chuckles)

512
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,890
- Morning, Colonel.
- Morning. You got some aspirins?

513
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,129
How many do you want?

514
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,619
l take eight every day.

515
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,576
Four's good.

516
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,618
- l need to talk to you, Specialist.
- Sir?

517
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,296
l'm investigating the recommendation to
award a Medal of Honour to Captain Walden.

518
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,770
Rowtero?

519
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,770
Yeah?

520
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,213
Can you cover for me?

521
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,734
l'm going to go feed the cancer genes.

522
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,175
Do you really need to, uh, l mean...

523
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,733
lt's fine.

524
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,492
Uh, what do you want to know?

525
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,895
How long were you with Captain Walden?

526
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,096
Um... over... over two years.

527
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,533
Quite a long time.

528
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,689
Yeah.

529
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,815
You were her medic.

530
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,379
Yes, sir.

531
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,453
l don't fly any more though.

532
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,258
Well, don't miss it, do you?

533
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,250
Never.

534
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,819
Never again.

535
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,458
That's quite a habit you got.

536
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,258
Yeah, it's, uh...

537
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,854
..one of the few things l can call my own.

538
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,817
(laughs)

539
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,209
So...

540
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,609
..tell me what happened at Al Kufan.

541
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,931
See, l'd, uh...

542
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,933
..l'd never been in... in combat.

543
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,938
(tapping)

544
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,772
(helicopter)

545
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,536
Mayday! Mayday! This is Dustoff-3!

546
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,697
We're going down!
Mayday! This is Dustoff-3...

547
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,331
(groaning)

548
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,134
(moaning)

549
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,890
llario?

550
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,413
Yeah, l'm OK.

551
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,616
Rady's hurt.

552
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,133
Monfriez?

553
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,376
(crackling)

554
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,290
Altameyer?

555
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,819
Functioning.

556
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,333
Fire in the hold!

557
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,812
(lario) Come here, buddy.

558
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,649
This is Dustoff-3.

559
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,536
Acknowledge.

560
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,417
This is Dustoff-3.

561
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,410
Here. Come on.

562
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,899
This is Dustoff-3.

563
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,049
Come on.

564
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,859
Dustoff-3. Acknowledge.
Altameyer, how's that fire?

565
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,215
Under control. Fuel tank's intact.

566
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,653
(gunfire)

567
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,650
Enemy at the back door!

568
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,695
Come on! Come on!

569
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,338
Monfriez, get that saw working!

570
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,409
Come on! Get down!

571
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,452
l've got the M-16!

572
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,859
(gunfire)

573
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,929
llario?

574
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,214
He's bad. lt's the lung.

575
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,131
We gotta get him out of here.

576
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:55,773
- Head wound?
- Superficial. How's the radio?

577
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,657
Dead. So's the ADT.

578
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,777
Monfriez, easy on the ammo!

579
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,293
We might be here a while!

580
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,409
Captain!

581
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,458
You've seen me do this a million times.
You'll be fine.

582
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,735
Ammo?

583
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,175
l got this belt and three more boxes.

584
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,929
OK, Altameyer,
rip out everything you can from the inside.

585
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,578
We're gonna make a perimeter.

586
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,855
Monfriez, cover us!

587
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,895
Go!

588
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,931
Where's our Kevlar?

589
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,009
l got one!

590
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,569
Well, put it on!

591
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,333
Unh. How's he doing?

592
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,694
He's the same.

593
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,133
l need a hook.

594
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,818
As soon as it gets dark, we dig in.

595
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,969
Then we wait.

596
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,049
For what?

597
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,619
For the good guys.

598
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,449
(laughing and shouting in Arabic)

599
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,651
You won't think it's so funny
when l nail your fucking ass!

600
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,816
Yeah, they were laughing.

601
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,935
You about, uh... You done?

602
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,813
So tell me what happened...

603
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,970
..during the night.

604
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,330
You were there. You saw the nights.

605
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,012
You know, just... it was black.

606
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,249
Just... black.

607
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,296
Tell me what happened that night.

608
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,976
Well, she put us on two-hour watches.

609
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:39,817
Um... it's not like
any of us were going to sleep anyway.

610
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,053
(Monfriez)
Head down, Altameyer. You might lose it.

611
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,815
You OK, Captain?

612
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,811
Shit in my eye.

613
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,652
Will our guys come tonight?

614
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,099
They'll be here.

615
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,693
Dust is blowing pretty bad.

616
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,055
l don't know
how much longer Rady can hang on.

617
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,449
l can hear the ragheads
when you're not gabbing.

618
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,417
Then l'd suggest everybody just...

619
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,013
They're going away.

620
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,613
lt was just a probe.

621
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,735
llario?

622
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,730
l'm OK.

623
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,730
Altameyer?

624
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,570
My ear!

625
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,615
Monfriez?

626
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,258
l... l took one.

627
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:36,130
- Rady?
- Hanging in. How about you, Cap?

628
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,495
Unh...

629
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,377
Oh, shit.

630
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,098
Stay with Rady.

631
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,652
l like to come here.

632
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,653
lt's notjust the bikinis,
although they ain't bad.

633
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,254
lt's these kids.

634
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,092
l like to watch them, you know?

635
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,058
My folks had this place
out on Calaveras Lake.

636
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,098
l still go there sometimes, watch 'em dive.

637
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,659
They do the damnedest things.

638
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,095
They never think about the consequences.

639
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,379
lmagine that.

640
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,497
lmagine not thinking
about the consequences?

641
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,252
lmagine that.

642
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,051
Are... are we done?

643
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,095
After the attack...

644
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,977
..during the night...

645
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,937
What?

646
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,453
l mean, we waited.

647
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,893
l... l still don't...

648
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,531
- l... l don't know what you...
- Just go on with what happened.

649
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:46,737
Well, Karen,...
the captain,... uh, was hurt pretty bad.

650
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,168
Ohh...

651
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,297
Unh...

652
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,257
Unh!

653
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,579
How many rounds left?

654
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,888
Just a sec.

655
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,333
How many rounds?

656
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,251
l just opened my last can of ammo.

657
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,331
Five mags for the M-16,...

658
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,455
..9-mil's full.

659
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,536
Mine's empty.

660
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,818
Fire a couple of rounds off.

661
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,812
- Let 'em know we're still alive.
- Roger that, Captain.

662
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:17,090
Now save your ammo
for something you can see.

663
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:23,418
During the course of the incident,
did she display any doubt, any fear...

664
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,810
..when she had to make
these life-and-death decisions?

665
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,652
No.

666
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,014
No. Never.

667
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,249
She just made 'em.

668
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,217
Just like that?

669
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,733
Just like that.

670
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,573
Karen,... the captain... she had this quality.

671
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,174
The heavier the pressure,
the calmer she got.

672
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,012
We knew they were out there,...

673
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,692
..sneaking up on us.

674
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,295
But we also knew
at first light they were going to attack.

675
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,214
l don't know why people think only
good things happen when the sun rises.

676
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,529
lncoming!

677
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,495
How many?

678
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,808
100. Maybe more.

679
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,379
Any good at hand-to-hand?

680
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,655
Wait till they get closer.

681
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,254
Make every round count!

682
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,739
- Shit!
- Quiet!

683
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,299
What in Christ for?

684
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,813
They know we're here!

685
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,777
Quiet! l hear something!

686
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,849
(helicopter)

687
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,931
Choppers!

688
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,570
Hey!

689
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,379
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

690
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,052
Go! Go!

691
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,368
Yeah! (laughs)

692
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,539
Let's get out of here!

693
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,609
llario, get the captain!

694
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,053
There's the rescue!

695
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,570
Help Rady!

696
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,218
Pick him up!

697
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,972
Go! Let's go! Let go! Let's go!

698
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,895
Come on! Let's move! Move it!

699
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,379
Gotta go! We gotta go!

700
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,496
Come back for me with a stretcher!

701
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,615
Go!

702
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,530
llario, let's get the fuck outta here!

703
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,011
Get the fuck outta here!

704
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,253
Aah!

705
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,819
Aah!

706
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,169
Medic!

707
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,972
Come on! Get him up!

708
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,816
Move! Come on! Let's go!

709
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,535
Where's Walden?

710
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,333
Captain Walden is dead.

711
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,374
Strike leader, this is Dustoff-6.

712
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,418
We have all the friendlies.
You're clear and hot.

713
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,060
Roger, Dustoff-6. Going on down.

714
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,731
So...

715
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,175
ls she gonna get it?
ls she gonna get the medal?

716
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,616
Well, l sincerely hope so.

717
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,056
l just... l don't want to tell that story again.

718
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,256
Not one more time.

719
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,932
Yeah, l understand.

720
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,059
May l be excused?

721
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,176
Yes, you can.

722
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,093
Oh, one more thing l'm confused about.

723
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,053
This M-16...

724
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,250
What?

725
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,137
Did it run out of ammo?

726
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,697
Uh, what did l say?

727
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,653
l don't remember. That's why l'm asking.

728
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,778
l guess, uh...

729
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,694
l guess it ran out of ammo
some time during the morning.

730
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,532
Um...

731
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,212
Or, no, some time during the night...

732
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,619
l don't know.

733
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,897
See, the Blackhawk crew
said they heard M-16 fire...

734
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,131
..during the rescue that morning.

735
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,092
Did they?

736
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,569
That's right.

737
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,252
Must've been wrong, then.

738
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,250
Them or you?

739
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,739
Who, them or you?

740
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,048
Oh, them. Them, yeah.

741
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,698
No, they must have been wrong.

742
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,658
OK.

743
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,729
OK.

744
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,853
What about the letter?

745
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,170
A what?

746
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:55,174
You and Walden traded letters to send home
in case anything happened to you.

747
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,329
Oh, yeah. Yes, sir.

748
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,694
So, who was hers to?

749
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,690
Her folks.

750
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,169
- So you sent it?
- Yeah.

751
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,898
Her folks, they're good people.

752
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,811
They got a farm out in Abilene.

753
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,734
They'd come to Hood, look after her kid
while we went out on exercises.

754
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,095
Yeah... Yeah.

755
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:13,770
OK.

756
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,578
Thank you, Specialist.

757
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,059
Thank you very much, sir.

758
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,657
l read somewhere...

759
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,857
..that if a child doesn't see a person die,...

760
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,898
..or dead, like in a casket,...

761
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,972
..that the person isn't really dead for them.

762
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,858
That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

763
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,129
Yes, ma'am.

764
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:44,257
lt was, uh... unusual, wasn't it,...

765
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,900
..for Karen to want to be a helicopter pilot?

766
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,096
l guess that's my fault.

767
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,410
l took her to the fair when she was 11.

768
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,651
12 - 7th grade.

769
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,413
Anyway, there was a helicopter there.

770
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,491
Small one with a bubble up front.

771
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:02,048
The fella... the pilot was selling rides.

772
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,734
l bought Karen a ticket.

773
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,856
lt was a short ride.

774
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,500
But when she came down...

775
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,378
Well, l don't think
she ever came down, actually.

776
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:17,691
She showed up
at the dinner table one day,...

777
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,613
..just after she finished TCU.

778
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,531
She's joined the Army.

779
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,372
She wants to fly helicopters.

780
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,973
She's real stubborn about it, too.

781
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,016
That's our Karen, you know, stubborn.

782
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,897
So's Anne Marie here.

783
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,291
Come here, honey.

784
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,335
Excuse me.

785
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,499
Uh, the young men,...

786
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,289
..the ones that came to tell us about Karen...

787
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,848
..they were dressed just like you.

788
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,613
Oh, l see.

789
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,769
Major Teegarden,...

790
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:58,251
..her commanding officer, he came, too,
when he came back from the Gulf.

791
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,891
Brought this photo back for Anne Marie.

792
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,171
Meant a lot to us...

793
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,137
..him coming to see us,...

794
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,893
..telling us in person how Karen died.

795
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,858
l lost men over there, too.

796
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,373
l spoke to the major.

797
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:19,329
Everybody thought the world
of your daughter. So did Specialist llario.

798
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:23,055
lt would sure help if l could see her letter.

799
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,971
l mean, if it's not too private.

800
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,015
Letter?

801
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,250
From llario?

802
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,698
l'll check my notes. Must be my mistake.

803
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,452
This her husband here?

804
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:37,373
No. That's Karen's older brother Billy.

805
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,928
Her husband's up in Michigan.

806
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,457
He and Karen divorced
after only a year or so.

807
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:49,409
He never... well,... it was no picnic.

808
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,411
Karen raised Anne Marie on her own.

809
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,129
We'd have been thrilled
to have Anne Marie with us all the time,...

810
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,496
..what with the Army and all.

811
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,491
But Karen was a real good mom.

812
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,249
Never asked for help
unless she really needed it.

813
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,093
You can't imagine how hard it was for her...

814
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,490
..to go off and leave that little girl
to fight in a war,...

815
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,777
..but it was important to Karen
to do her duty.

816
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:16,418
So she went.

817
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,091
(children's voices)

818
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,772
You've been out here 20 minutes
since l spotted you.

819
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:46,420
- How much longer before that?
- 15.

820
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:52,288
l see you, uh...

821
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,132
..got the new refrigerator.

822
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:58,611
Do you think the kids will understand
why their daddy is out here in a Chevy...

823
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,692
..instead of playing with them
in the front yard?

824
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,374
Or at Fort Hood,
like you told me you were?

825
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,614
Are you back?

826
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,099
l'm in transit.

827
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,049
You know, Nat, it took me a long time...

828
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,815
..to figure out how to be an Army wife
without obliterating myself.

829
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,777
lt wasn't easy, but l did it.

830
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,851
l know you did, Mer.

831
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,896
So it wouldn't be a hardship for me...

832
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,369
..to learn how not to be an Army wife...

833
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,655
..if my husband wasn't in the Army any more.

834
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,015
The Army's my life, Mer.

835
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,732
And so are we.

836
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,895
You don't have to figure it all out, Nat.

837
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,336
You just have to admit that you can't.

838
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,454
You have to want to be here with us,...

839
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,529
..that's all.

840
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,172
We'll be here.

841
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,579
For a while.

842
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,049
Now go away.

843
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:21,937
lf you're not going to stay,
l don't want the kids to see you.

844
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,900
- (tape) This M-16, did it run out of ammo?
- (buzzer)

845
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,811
(woman) Yes, sir?

846
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,813
- Colonel Serling, you can go in now.
- l don't remember...

847
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,813
Hey, Nat, what's up?

848
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,253
General.

849
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,776
lt's the Walden file, sir.
One or two discrepancies.

850
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,815
Discrepancies?

851
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,969
Yes, sir.

852
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,938
l knew those White House clowns
were up to something.

853
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,251
- lf she doesn't deserve it, she won't get it.
- lt's not Captain Walden, sir.

854
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,889
lt's some of the details of the stories
l'm getting from her crew.

855
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,336
- l don't know how significant...
- l'm drowning in paper here.

856
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,218
They're crawling all over my ass
for combat assessments,...

857
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:12,328
Sir, l just wanted to let you know this is
not a rubber-stamp situation, that's all.

858
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:16,777
Now, this specialist, uh, llario,
there's something funny about his story.

859
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:20,250
We're not giving the medal to llario.
We're giving it to Walden.

860
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,295
Roger.

861
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,733
Splendid. Move forward.

862
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:26,813
OK. The discrepancies specifically
relate to... use of an M-16 rifle...

863
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,415
Come on, Nat! No two eyewitnesses
ever agree on every detail.

864
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,411
You know that as well as l do.

865
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,172
When do we get that report?

866
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,091
l want the White House off my back.

867
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,499
A few days, sir.

868
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:42,210
You agree that this report should be
as detailed and accurate as possible?

869
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,536
Which means exactly what, Colonel?

870
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,930
Which means exactly what l said, sir.

871
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:48,975
(knock on door)

872
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:54,531
Sorry, sir. This is the second copy
of Colonel Serling's Al Bathra deposition.

873
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,930
The investigator seemed to have
misplaced the last one.

874
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,419
Rise above.

875
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,058
This will all be over soon.

876
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:05,373
Will there be
a public statement of the facts...

877
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,257
..when the investigation is over, sir?

878
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:11,538
There's been a decision not to release
any findings until every case...

879
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,451
..has been thoroughly reviewed.

880
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:16,452
Well, how long do you imagine
that will be, sir?

881
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:22,251
l mean, next time l see Lieutenant Boylar's
parents, l'd like to tell them the whole truth.

882
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,697
You know how many grieving parents
l had to deal with during Vietnam?

883
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:27,769
This is not Vietnam.

884
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,977
Lieutenant Boylar's tank
was hit by uranium-depleted shells.

885
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,370
We're the only country
in the world that uses them.

886
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:38,339
We got reporters from the Washington Post
looking for the truth,...

887
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,854
..and the only person that knows it
can't say it...

888
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:44,774
..because these investigators
are dragging their backsides!

889
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:48,933
Someone has got to be
accountable for this,... sir.

890
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,099
Take a seat.

891
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:15,255
Nat, l'm going to give you
all the rope in the world.

892
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,490
First you imply l'm not interested...

893
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,775
..in an accurate report on Captain Walden.

894
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:23,933
Now you're suggesting there must be
some cover-up going on about Al Bathra.

895
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,851
So how do you want me to respond?

896
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,817
As your commanding officer,...

897
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,734
..or as your friend
who nursed you, pushed promotions,...

898
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,051
..and fucking burped your kids
at their baptisms?

899
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,416
Just how should l respond?

900
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,299
l'm sorry, sir.

901
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,570
l should hope by God you would be.

902
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,092
Now,...

903
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,855
..losing a man like your friend Boylar,...

904
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,294
..l've been there.

905
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,769
Well, this...

906
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,691
..whole mess...

907
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,859
lt's my ass on the line
right there beside yours.

908
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:05,376
l can feel the chill in the air
as well as you can.

909
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,257
Yes, sir.

910
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,774
And l know about the drinking.

911
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,818
And if l have to write you up,...

912
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,368
..it'll just be one more bite out of your record.

913
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:16,609
Clean it up.

914
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,089
Get yourself in a programme.

915
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,977
l'll be looking for that report.

916
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,539
Soon.

917
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,289
- (Nat) Yes, this is the Serling residence.
- (Mer) We're not in right now...

918
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:45,090
- But at the tone, leave a message and...
- (kids) We'll call you when we get home.

919
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,659
(laughter)

920
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,139
(beep)

921
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,736
(gunfire)

922
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,458
You better get your head into this!

923
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:13,215
l'm going to drop you
from this programme like a hot rock!

924
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,779
You better hurry up!

925
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,412
Morning, sir. Monfriez is over there.
l'll get him for you.

926
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,410
Thank you.

927
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,731
What the fuck are you doing, soldier?
Where are your men?

928
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,095
- There, sir.
- Yeah? What do you call that?

929
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,772
You see that man?

930
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,250
You and he are brothers.
He depends on you. You depend on him.

931
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,649
You never leave a man behind.

932
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,937
- Yes, Drill Sergeant!
- Now get the fuck out of here.

933
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
(Nat) You were in Panama?

934
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,000
Yes, sir.

935
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,500
Were you there, sir?
