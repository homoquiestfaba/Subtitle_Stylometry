1
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:43,074
Well, all right. Look at all that
beautiful, white stuff come down.

2
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,368
Christmas is right around the corner...

3
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,705
...and chanukah starts tonight.

4
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:49,381
Ain't a better time of year.

5
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:54,212
You got no school, you can eat
like a pig and people give you stuff.

6
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,117
Just makes you feel tingly all over.

7
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,215
But you know what?

8
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,260
There are some buffoons out there who
actually can't stand the holiday season.

9
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,862
And seeing other people
enjoy the festivities...

10
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,590
...gets them even more disgusted.

11
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,129
In fact, the head honcho of holiday
humbug...

12
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:15,034
...lives right here in little old dukesberry.
His name's davey stone.

13
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,539
That fool's in the china dragon...

14
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,237
...coming up with his own way
of feeling tingly all over.

15
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:27,444
Four scorpion bowl in five minute?
That's got to be a restaurant record.

16
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:32,722
Well, right now i'm going to go for
another restaurant record: Longest burp.

17
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,630
Congratulations. Now, please excuse me
while i go take shower.

18
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:52,473
At one time, davey was a super student,
super athlete...

19
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:56,476
...super sweet, super kid and the apple
of his parents' eye.

20
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,486
Now, he's just a 33-year-old,
crazy jewish guy...

21
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,147
...who lives for making this town
as miserable as he is...

22
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,758
...especially on the first night
of chanukah.

23
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,760
How'd he end up this way?
Let's save that for later...

24
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:16,698
...because right now, davey's about to
get himself into some serious trouble.

25
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,976
Hope you're not planning on driving
tonight, stone.

26
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,943
No, officer. I'm just going to say
good night to my car...

27
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:31,982
...then walk home and enjoy
the holiday decorations.

28
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:36,120
Listen, sweetheart. I have to leave you
here alone tonight...

29
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:40,157
...but don't you worry, i'll be back
first thing in the morning.

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,319
Now, behave yourself,
and don't stay up too late.

31
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,965
Nighty-night.

32
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,964
All right, baby. But let's make this quick.

33
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,970
Oh, mama!

34
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,369
You like it when i hold you like this?

35
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,636
Because i'll do it all night long.

36
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,204
So sweet.

37
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:06,842
Yes, so precious.

38
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,819
I love you, car.

39
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,518
He dine and dash me! He chew and
screw me! He sip and skip me!

40
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,663
- What?
- He no pay for his four scorpion bowl.

41
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,093
Oh, boy.

42
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,161
Get him.

43
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,171
Come back here, you jerk!

44
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,504
Somebody stop that guy!

45
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,883
I'm the kind of guy who can't stand
a holiday

46
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:42,043
so i drink them all away, that's me

47
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,554
i don't decorate no trees

48
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,216
and i won't eat no potato latkes

49
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:54,025
but i'll give this old lady's melons
a squeeze

50
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,896
that's just who i am

51
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,072
well, i'll never spin a dreidel,
but i'll always throw an egg

52
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:10,375
and i'll charley horse your leg for laughs

53
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:14,077
while you're singing your holiday tunes

54
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,882
i'm acting like the town buffoon

55
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:21,925
whipping out my big, white, scary moon

56
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,564
and blowing a beef your way

57
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,224
i hate folks who think reindeer are cute

58
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,461
to me they're just something to shoot

59
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,766
i hate love

60
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,737
i hate you

61
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,808
i hate me

62
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,612
well, i'm a snowmobile-stealing

63
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:47,650
no 'tis-the-season-feeling kind of guy

64
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:52,117
this time of year sucks
so i take my nunchaks

65
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:56,284
and make sure every snowman dies

66
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,795
believing in santa's all wrong

67
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,767
and chanukah's eight nights too long

68
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,263
i hate love

69
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,996
i hate you

70
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,104
i hate me

71
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,433
coming through.

72
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,769
I hate love

73
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,605
i hate you

74
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,940
i hate me

75
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,208
davey stone, you're nothing
but a delinquent!

76
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:22,014
Stone, what the heck are we
going to do with you?

77
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:26,783
I've sent you to reform school, the drunk
tank, the local psychiatric ward.

78
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,486
Not one of those places has made you
change an ounce for the better.

79
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,324
You used to be a good kid...

80
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:37,469
...playing ball for the jewish community
center, with the best shot ever seen.

81
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,470
Your honor, i still got a pretty good
jump shot. Let me show you.

82
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,345
I'd hit a 3-pointer, but i'd
have to drop my pants...

83
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,640
...and pop a thumb up my boo-boo.

84
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:54,343
You leave me no choice. I'll really
have to crack down hard this time.

85
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:59,685
Your honor, if it pleases the court,
i'd like to interject for a moment.

86
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:04,056
What the hell was that? Did anybody
hear a parakeet, or am i going crazy?

87
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,721
No, mr. Chang. It's me, whitey duvall.

88
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:10,903
And a happy first night of chanukah
to you.

89
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,661
I'm not jewish.

90
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:17,275
Neither am i, but that don't stop me
from enjoying a holiday.

91
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,838
Whitey, we went over this
two months ago.

92
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,346
It's your last year of reffing
the youth league basketball.

93
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,040
You're turning 70 years old...

94
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:29,710
...and our insurance company says
they won't cover you anymore.

95
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,913
No, no, no.

96
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:35,924
My interjection pertains to the case
currently under adjudication.

97
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,687
You see, i knew this young man
years ago...

98
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,698
...when his moral fiber was still intact.

99
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,391
What are you getting at?

100
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:48,097
Why not sentence him to be a
referee-in-training for youth basketball?

101
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:52,071
I've seen some pretty rowdy kids
turn into perfect gentlemen...

102
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,712
...after spending time on my court.

103
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,439
If that happened with stone,
it would be a miracle.

104
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:02,279
It's the holidays. Things like that have
been known to happen this time of year.

105
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,214
Whitey, if you want to work with
this punk, then god bless you.

106
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,396
But mr. Stone, what whitey says goes.

107
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,461
And if i hear that you break one law...

108
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:17,194
...l'll send you to the state
penitentiary for no less than 10 years.

109
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,233
Happy holidays.

110
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,236
Oh, god.

111
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,071
The short man who's kind
and the donkey's behind.

112
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:30,306
What a bizarre matchup.
Good luck, whitey. You'll need it.

113
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,584
Okay, let's give the little guy
some support.

114
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,783
Did i just see two persian cats
on your ass?

115
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:45,327
I think i'm going to barf.

116
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,366
Your horn works, try the lights.

117
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,599
Okay.

118
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,003
One. Two.

119
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,336
Good to see you still got circus feet.

120
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:03,675
Men's 11 right foot, children's
9 left foot...

121
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,282
...at your service.

122
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:06,809
Yuck.

123
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,778
Now, i assume you've done
your pre-game stretching.

124
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,651
No, let me do it right now.

125
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,191
One. Two. Three.

126
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,453
Four. Five. Six.

127
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,531
Okay. That's good, but don't forget
your hammies.

128
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,965
Of course whitey wouldn't understand
what getting flipped off means.

129
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,128
He's so behind the times,
he thinks viagra's a big waterfall.

130
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,132
But there is one thing he knows.

131
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,767
The voting has begun for the highest
honor anyone in town could receive.

132
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,779
I think it's gonna be your year, whitey.
I really do.

133
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,179
Whoa. Don't even think of coming
on this floor with those hard soles, pally.

134
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,359
Fine, i'll just ref in my socks.

135
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,321
Must be game time.

136
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,659
Don't let him push your buttons, whitey.

137
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,189
What are you waiting for?

138
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:24,352
- Come on. Dribble!
- Hurry up!

139
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,132
What, no whistle on that one, ref?

140
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,599
Okay.

141
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,203
Foul on this kid for eating
everything in sight.

142
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:42,878
Jelly jugs, next time you come on
my court, you better wear a bra. Okay?

143
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,882
He was just kidding, son.
You've got very nice boobs.

144
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,613
- Jerk!
- Idiot!

145
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:54,724
You don't like that? How about you
throw something at me. I dare you.

146
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,759
With pleasure!

147
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:01,893
They're scratching up my floor.
Here comes a seizure.

148
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:06,769
This will pass in a second, kids.

149
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,440
Don't be scared.

150
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,131
Is he break dancing?

151
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:16,078
Okay, that's it. Game over.
Nobody wants to see an old man die.

152
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,410
Fatty's team loses because
i want to see him cry again.

153
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,985
I want to talk to you in my office.

154
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,825
Why the hell are we at the mall?

155
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,122
You need to clean your brain out.

156
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,664
And to me, the mall is the best place
to do that.

157
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,425
What's good about this place?

158
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,596
What's good about it? Everything.
You want a pair of socks?

159
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,971
My buddy, mr. Foot locker,
will warm your feet.

160
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,838
You need a fancy doodad?

161
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:52,313
Hello, sharper lmage. Thanks for the
combination pogo sticklclock radio.

162
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,112
I mean, the body shop, the tie rack...

163
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,118
...gnc, radioshack...

164
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,783
...petland for a cat or two,
spencer's gifts for some fake dog doo...

165
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,690
...sbarro's, dunkin' donuts,
they're simply the best.

166
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,865
And don't forget the orange
chicken at panda express.

167
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,501
But if you're short of cash
like little old me...

168
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,467
...the window shopping's always free.

169
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,543
Did you prepare that or did you rhyme
that many times in a row by accident?

170
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,441
Yeah, that was weird, wasn't it?

171
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,137
Maybe you are a leprechaun.

172
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,045
Let's just get some snacks and chat.
Okay?

173
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,750
Aren't you a boy?

174
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,486
Now, i'd like to make this work out.

175
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,823
But in order to do so, you're
going to have to learn...

176
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:43,697
...that youth basketball ain't about you
and your lack of respect for others.

177
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:49,170
It's about the kids and teaching them
responsibility and teamwork.

178
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,504
I've been doing my part for 35 years.

179
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,681
Are you ready to join me, big guy?

180
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,923
Joke's on you, tough guy. I can't read.

181
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,856
Special delivery for whitey duvall,
sugar-free doughnuts.

182
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:13,759
Every day she does this for me.
Jennifer, you're too much.

183
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,866
My fraternal twin sister's a diabetic...

184
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,631
...and out of respect for her and her
disease, i don't eat sugar products.

185
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,536
There's a surprise in there you'll like.

186
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,441
Don't tell me it's bavarian cream-filled.

187
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,406
It is bavarian cream-filled!

188
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:32,914
Hubba-bubba!

189
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:38,455
These babies make my taste buds
do double daffies, for gosh sakes.

190
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,759
Why are you hiding over there?

191
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,053
It's okay, sweetheart. Talk to whitey.

192
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:46,096
Hi, whitey. I got another chanukah
present tonight.

193
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:50,234
Wow, benjamin, an etch a sketch.
Not too shabby.

194
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,131
That's a game boy, you idiot.

195
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:55,239
Sorry, i'm not up
on modern technology.

196
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,901
But i guess my friend davey is.
Why don't you tell him what else you got.

197
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,570
First night, i got a basketball
and some dreidels.

198
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,580
Night two, i got a pup tent for camping
in the backyard.

199
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,480
And tonight, i got this.

200
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:12,623
Wow. Maybe on night four the chanukah
monster will take a big crap on your bed.

201
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,258
Thanks for sharing the holiday spirit,
psycho.

202
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,987
Come and help me
clean the muffin trays.

203
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,065
- Bye, whitey.
- See you at the game tomorrow.

204
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:27,271
Your girlfriend's backyard
isn't sugar-free. That baby looks sweet.

205
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,101
Technical foul! Technical foul!

206
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,507
That's a lady, and you will not
speak about her that way!

207
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:34,770
Easy.

208
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,438
She's going through a tough time now.

209
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,450
Last spring, her husband of 13 years
ups and leaves her...

210
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,282
...for a woman he met on the computer.

211
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:49,792
She had the courage to move back a
month ago to try and raise her boy alone.

212
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,519
So she's available?

213
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,530
You wish, mac. You blew your shot
with her 20 years ago.

214
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,031
Twenty years?

215
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,033
Was that jennifer friedman?

216
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,900
I'm surprised you have enough
brain cells left to remember.

217
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:09,307
Hey, jennifer, you still coming over to
watch dukes of hazzard after the game?

218
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,846
That's a big 10-4, davey.

219
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,040
Hey, davey.

220
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,651
Smile! Your mom wants to take a picture.

221
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:16,880
Thanks, honey.

222
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:19,886
If my parents fall asleep early,
i'll show you my basement.

223
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,626
Keep dreaming.

224
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,423
They make a nice couple
boogie-oogie-oogies.

225
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,166
I don't know when you were goofier,
then or now.

226
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,703
Good evening, mayor stuey duhy.
Out for some late-night shopping?

227
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:39,003
Yeah. Then i have to figure out how to
rebuild our giant menorah and santa.

228
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,578
Thanks for ruining the ice pageant again,
stone.

229
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,271
I didn't do it for you.
I did it for the ladies.

230
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,508
Yeah, right.

231
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:51,850
Has there been talk about who the lucky
patch recipient may be this year or...?

232
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,755
That's up to who the town votes for.
Could be you or me or anybody.

233
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,394
All right, i'm going to get going now.

234
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,758
Happy holidays, your excellence.

235
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,527
Good night, mayor! And the answer
to your question is spencer's gifts.

236
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,229
They definitely have furry underwear.

237
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,369
You're gross.

238
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:16,105
Is it just me, or did you notice
when he said, "it could be you"...

239
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,249
...there was a certain sincerity
in his voice, or...?

240
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,079
You actually give a crap
about winning a patch?

241
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:27,123
It's only the most prestigious award
given out at the all-star banquet.

242
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,260
Can you imagine?

243
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,223
Won't you dance with me

244
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,096
at the annual all-star banquet?

245
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:41,737
We'll be so fancy-free

246
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:46,003
at the annual all-star banquet

247
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:50,605
everyone in town will be looking
their best

248
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:54,411
even mrs. Selman with her one
extra breast

249
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,579
it's the kind of a night when your
feet match

250
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:03,421
when you feel nearly 5-foot-3!

251
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:07,655
They'll laugh and they'll dance
and they'll pee in their pants

252
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:12,963
'cause there's a patch at the
all-star banquet waiting for me

253
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,936
can you take me home now?

254
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:22,939
Well, that was nice of davey to snap
whitey out of his little dream.

255
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:26,948
All that song was saying was
the patch means the world to whitey.

256
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,519
He'd rather be remembered
for his hard work...

257
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:33,054
...not for the fact that he had the
hairiest buns in the locker room.

258
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,623
Can you blame him?

259
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,061
How's that peanut brittle?

260
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,962
Crunchy and delicious.

261
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:50,700
Funny, i don't remember denise
or janice ringing up a purchase for you.

262
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:53,309
I guess that means i stole it.

263
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,813
Easy, seizure-boy!

264
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,719
That's it. I'm calling the judge.

265
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:06,981
Go ahead. I'll be on the first bus out.
I ain't spending 10 years in prison.

266
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,024
Maybe i'll just take you in myself.

267
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,664
Don't think you can intimidate me
just because of my size.

268
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:16,164
Why? You're smaller than me?
I didn't notice that.

269
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,000
Put me down! Put me down!

270
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,331
And get out of my car right now!

271
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,603
Oh, no. You're going to make me walk
10 feet? That's where i live, idiot!

272
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,571
Thanks for the ride, patchy.

273
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,045
It was great patching with you.

274
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,742
And i guess i'll patch you later.

275
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,589
I'm letting this one go, stone.

276
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:43,624
But next screwup, it's slammer time.

277
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,068
Got any sand or rock salt in there?

278
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,108
I need to get some traction.

279
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:04,440
"Got any sand or rock salt in there?
'Cause i need to get some..."

280
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,877
oh, shut up!

281
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,453
He could've at least given me a push
or something.

282
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,510
- Closing, channel 36 would
like to wish all of its jewish viewers...

283
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,145
...the very happiest of chanukahs.

284
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,281
Boo!

285
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,630
Hey!

286
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,606
A little help, fellas?

287
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:17,513
One. Two. Three!

288
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,648
Have a holly, jolly one, guys.

289
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,487
Doesn't it make you feel good...

290
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,993
...when you see a group of deer
helping a motorist in need?

291
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,497
But i bet whitey wishes they showed up
earlier...

292
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,931
...because his sister, eleanore,
gets a little edgy when he's late.

293
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,935
Whitey, where were you?

294
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:38,805
You're an hour and 51 minutes late.
I already called the morgue.

295
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,344
They said you weren't there,
but to try back later.

296
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:45,649
I had an interesting talk
with the mayor tonight.

297
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:51,187
The mayor? Was it about the ruffians
who stole my liz taylor wig?

298
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,082
Eleanore, that was 45 years ago.

299
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,658
I'm still shaking from it.

300
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,157
Anyways, the mayor seems to think
there's a chance...

301
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,595
...i might receive the patch this year.

302
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:06,600
Oh, boy. Let's just soak our feet, brother.

303
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,167
First position. Second position.

304
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,840
See you later, smell.

305
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,346
Just don't get your hopes up too high
about the patch.

306
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,883
I can handle myself,
eleanore. Trust me.

307
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:47,877
When you have enough lights to make
your house look like the vegas strip...

308
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,446
...you'll have a big electric bill.

309
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,016
And being a volunteer referee
for the youth basketball league...

310
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:56,643
...doesn't exactly get you
in the fortune 500.

311
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:01,592
So old whitey's up early every day,
searching the town for odd jobs...

312
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,591
...to help make ends meet
for him and eleanore.

313
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,054
How's that, fellas?!

314
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,734
It's crooked, shorty. Move it to the right.

315
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:10,925
You got it.

316
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,029
Whoops.

317
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:25,173
Well, will you look at that.
It's a jackass-in-the-box.

318
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,278
Let's go get some coffee.

319
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,582
Anything else i can do for you guys?

320
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,919
If you clean out the crappers,
i'll give you a buck.

321
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,419
Consider it done.
Nice doing business with you.

322
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,478
That's what happens
when you hit the bottle.

323
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:05,646
You go to sleep in dukesberry,
you wake up in pukesberry.

324
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,222
Pukesberry.

325
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,485
Hey. What are you do...? No!

326
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:27,235
The worst has happened.
I'm covered in human feces.

327
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:32,614
That's a good look for you. But for
health reasons, i should spray you off.

328
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,655
Smell you later, poopsicle.

329
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,357
You're a fricking degenerate.

330
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,193
I know i am.

331
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,447
A little help, please.

332
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,060
Your tongues tickle.

333
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,956
They tickle.

334
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,697
You are right. That was gross.

335
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,662
Thumbelina, there's no kids playing.
Why'd you tell me to come?

336
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:31,435
I thought you could use a refresher
course on b-ball rules and regulations.

337
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:35,806
- You're nuts. I'm going to pound a few.
- First of all, you booze, you lose.

338
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,538
And secondly, if you don't turn around...

339
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:44,086
...officer sherman over there'll know of
the infamous peanut brittle incident.

340
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,785
What's with the dunkin' munchkin?

341
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:51,486
His mom had to do a double shift so i'm
watching him till she can get here.

342
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,632
Now, both of you cop a squat
next to me and let's observe.

343
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,136
Take it! Take it!

344
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,805
Charging! Our ball.

345
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:06,205
See, that wasn't a charge.
It was actually blocking.

346
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,972
The defender didn't have both feet
planted in time.

347
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,242
Oh, really? Because i thought
that was high-sticking.

348
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,913
Don't encourage him, benjamin. He's
upset because he can't play no more.

349
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:23,594
Twenty years of drinking destroyed
the basketball lobe of his brain.

350
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:27,265
I can whup any of those clowns
out there even with you as my partner.

351
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,990
I'd like to see that.

352
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,859
I'd like to see that right now.

353
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:34,333
He was just kidding, fellas.
Whole lot of jibber jabber.

354
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,168
We got no beef with you guys.

355
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:42,005
Because if a midget and a drunk
can beat us, i'd eat my own jockstrap.

356
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,512
No, he don't play ball anymore.

357
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:48,551
I'll play. But if we win, you got
to eat that guy's jockstrap.

358
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,891
First to five wins. We're shirts.

359
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,123
Oh, boy. Does that mean we're skins?

360
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,900
I don't see any skin, monkey-man.

361
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,034
Just pass me the ball.

362
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,898
All right, fuzzy wuzzy.

363
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:12,371
All right, simmer down, whitey.
Don't travel. Don't double dribble.

364
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,172
I want a good, clean game
and no back talk.

365
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,712
Orangutan, you're playing, not reffing.

366
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:22,051
He's right. Look for your opening
and take it.

367
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,546
There it is!

368
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,725
Now set yourself and shoot.

369
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:35,832
Oh, no.

370
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:39,836
Are you finally dead, old man?

371
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:45,441
I'll be over to feed the cats
in the morning...

372
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,043
...mrs. Addison.

373
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:51,305
Okay, he's useless.

374
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,576
One more thing.

375
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,319
Good kitty. Nice kitty.

376
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:03,927
Muffin boy, what's your real name?

377
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,119
Benjamin.

378
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,955
You're in. Let's go.

379
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:09,923
You're trading in the midget for a spaz?

380
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,131
This is going to be even sadder.

381
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,207
We'll see. Your ball.

382
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,432
Oops.

383
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,769
I'm not very good.

384
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:22,936
That's all right. Just try to stay
confident, and if i say shoot it, shoot it.

385
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,911
Game on.

386
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:29,951
He may be big, but he's ugly, benny.

387
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,480
Good luck, chump.

388
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,258
- I'll take that.
- Hey!

389
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:37,958
Put it up.

390
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,292
Coming through!

391
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:45,492
That's all right, just keep your
elbow in. Now stick it, kid.

392
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,132
Yeah!

393
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,740
Looks like you better start
showing the spaz some respect.

394
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:53,638
Just keep playing.

395
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:04,649
Where am i going, baby?
Where am i going? Oh, snap. Oh, snap.

396
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,686
- Trap him.
- I'm on it.

397
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,885
It's all you, buddy.

398
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:13,321
I hope you all like your
jockstraps extra sweaty.

399
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,897
One. Two.

400
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:17,895
Three.

401
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,199
- You wanna win this or not?
- Yeah.

402
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,339
Well, then cover the nerd.

403
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:25,840
The saga continues.

404
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,112
Not this time, little man.

405
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,353
Hey, look what i still got.

406
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,225
Yeah, good coverage.

407
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,826
What a shot.

408
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,830
I call that the
top-of-the-key-eat-the-jockstrap shot.

409
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,009
Hold it now. Hold it now.

410
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,440
Where's it going now?

411
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,844
How's he doing that?

412
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,011
Oh, boy.

413
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:08,949
Put it up, ben.

414
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:11,579
Got a piece!

415
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,054
Bam! Got a piece of my ass.

416
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,220
Shut up!

417
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:19,225
One more basket and it's chow time,
boys.

418
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:29,567
Let's bring it home.

419
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,372
You're my boy, benny.

420
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,082
Whoa, little lverson.

421
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,021
- Double up on stone!
- You got it!

422
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,722
Put it up, benny.

423
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,053
What's happening?

424
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,395
- No!
- Oh, benny!

425
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,065
You gotta be kidding me!

426
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,257
Yeah!

427
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,363
Now say what i told you to say.

428
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:02,868
Eat that nut-strap, bitch!

429
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,500
Benjamin!

430
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:10,775
Don't ever use that kind of language
again. Do you hear me?

431
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,277
I'm sorry.

432
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,109
He's just having some fun.

433
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:19,151
Cursing and acting like a jerk may be
your idea of fun, but it won't be his.

434
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,824
One davey stone
around here is enough.

435
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,387
My finger's in your mouth, kitty...

436
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:30,829
...but i don't feel no teeth.

437
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,661
Let's go, benjamin.

438
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,401
Why are you eating that?

439
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,912
You know, my mother doesn't
like you very much.

440
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:47,243
You know, i don't like me
very much either.

441
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,682
Nice playing with you, mini-shaq.

442
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,288
Why was she looking at me like that?

443
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,960
How could they let that guy
work with kids?

444
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:06,296
Giving me those nasty eyes.

445
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,462
I was being nice to her kid.

446
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,001
They should have locked
him up for good.

447
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,074
At least she was looking at me.
That felt all right.

448
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,671
Why can't he just be like he used to be?

449
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,844
It all seems so long ago

450
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:26,181
young and happy don't you know

451
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,849
down by the creek i would show

452
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:33,029
fireflies to that girl

453
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,634
but that was back when he was nice

454
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:40,201
before my warm heart turned to ice

455
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,863
my sister's wig once had lice

456
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,307
but that was long ago

457
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:51,140
the schoolyard's where we were

458
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,874
the first time i kissed her

459
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,712
he thought he got some tongue

460
00:30:56,921 --> 00:31:00,254
but it was only retainer

461
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,119
eleanore's bra is a trainer

462
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:06,556
well, over there's my family home

463
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,224
and the woods we used to roam

464
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:13,836
the only time i had
sex was on the phone

465
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,528
but that was long ago

466
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,566
i carved our names upon that tree

467
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:23,372
i loved him and he loved me

468
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:27,142
my darling wife was once a he

469
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:30,378
but that was long ago

470
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,556
he'd always whisper in my ear

471
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:37,091
but then i started drinking beer

472
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:42,598
my jewels got licked by six frisky deer

473
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:48,530
now he's just a loner and a liar

474
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,538
and my trailer's caught on fire

475
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:52,733
fire?!

476
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,208
Oh, my god!

477
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,748
Be careful!

478
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,298
Maybe it's some kind of sign.

479
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:21,996
After all, chanukah is
the festival of lights.

480
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,208
I should stick you on
a twig and roast you.

481
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,471
Just get back in my car. You'll stay
with me and my sister for a while.

482
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:31,341
I ain't living with you buffoons.

483
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:35,143
What other options do you got, mr.
Rockefeller?

484
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,494
- Hello?
- Hi, is ophelia there?

485
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:52,225
- Ophelia who?
- Ophelia hiney.

486
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,099
Oh, feel my hiney?

487
00:32:55,606 --> 00:33:00,771
You hoodlums better bring my
wig back! I know it was you!

488
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,691
It's a home-invasion robbery!

489
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:20,956
Take whatever you want, but please
don't chop my legs off!

490
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,395
It's okay, eleanore, it's okay.

491
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:28,071
Whitey, thank god you're here. We're
being robbed by a lunatic.

492
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,537
Mister, if you're going to kill us, take
off your wet shoes.

493
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,075
They're soaking the carpet.

494
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:38,137
Eleanore, that's davey stone, my new
partner.

495
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:43,411
The criminal?! Did he force you to
bring him here so he could molest you?

496
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:50,051
His home just went up in flames. So i
invited him to stay with us for a while.

497
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,563
Okay, but i'm making an inventory...

498
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:00,568
...of every single item in this house.

499
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:01,829
Fascinating.

500
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:07,103
Look! He already stole something.
He's hiding it in his jacket.

501
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,836
I didn't steal this.
It's a card my parents gave me.

502
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,812
So why don't you go stay with them?

503
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,008
They died.

504
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,742
My bad.

505
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,951
Here's to you guys for letting me
crash over.

506
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:25,059
Alcohol in our house?
This is never going to work.

507
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:30,198
It will. We just need to set some rules
so davey knows how we do things here.

508
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,130
I'm scared.

509
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:36,705
Look. You gotta understand it's just
been me and eleanore for 67 years...

510
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,240
...so she gets nervous around
strangers.

511
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,435
I wouldn't show that picture to anyone...

512
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,376
...or they may try to take you two back
to the laboratory.

513
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,842
Listen. We got rules in this house...

514
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:50,487
...and you better follow them or you'll
find yourself out of here.

515
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,750
This might be harder than i thought.

516
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:59,861
If you're coming from the street
with dirty shoes on your feet

517
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,895
that's a technical foul

518
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,933
if you switch the radio to some
"modern" music show

519
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,436
that's a technical foul

520
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,577
if you don't shut the door

521
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,010
after using the 'frigerator

522
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:21,151
that's a technical foul

523
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:24,821
a technical foul

524
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,453
if you touch the thermostat

525
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,023
you'll get hit with a bat

526
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,024
'cause that's a technical foul

527
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,923
you will feel my wrath

528
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:36,464
- lf your hair clogs the drain
- you'll know the meaning of pain

529
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,430
'cause that's a technical foul

530
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,763
i'll show you no mercy

531
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,532
ho! This is such bullshit

532
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,473
in this house we say "bullspit"

533
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:50,647
or it's a technical foul

534
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:52,415
a technical foul

535
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:56,417
let me get this straight. You expect me
to change my lifestyle in one night...

536
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,523
...because you guys are a couple of
psychotic control freaks?

537
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,215
- You got it, bub.
- Or you can go rot in the gutter.

538
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,224
- It's up to you, yankee doodle.
- I don't want to do that...

539
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,956
...but let me run a few questions by you
so i don't screw up accidentally.

540
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:13,670
If i don't spray lysol
after moving a bowel?

541
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,736
That's a technical foul

542
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:21,143
if i decide to wash my ass
with your monogrammed towel?

543
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,246
- That's a technical foul
- please, say "hiney."

544
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:28,574
If i make fun of your crazy feeties

545
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:31,754
or give sugar cookies to miss diabetes

546
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,083
that's not only a technical foul

547
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,988
but possibly a homicide

548
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,165
can i sleep past 3?

549
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,096
If you do, you'll get a t

550
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:48,670
- take a whiz in those flowers?
- I'll say, "hit the showers"

551
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,104
- use this horn as a bong?
- Adios, tommy chong

552
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,971
make some long-distance calls?

553
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:56,874
You'll get a kick in the balls
oops!

554
00:36:57,081 --> 00:37:00,175
Can i walk around with
my morning erection?

555
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,478
If you want an automatic ejection

556
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,350
'cause that's a technical foul

557
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,526
but i'd like to see it anyway

558
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,253
just kidding.

559
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,522
There are certain rules
which apply in one's life

560
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:20,397
with your sister, friends
or imaginary wife

561
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:24,199
i can't believe i haven't killed myself

562
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:28,401
here with wigs mcgee and the furry elf

563
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,741
they took my wig

564
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:36,077
i remember the look in their eyes

565
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,415
i guess i'll have to deal
with your demands

566
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:43,559
but please don't touch me
with your alien hands

567
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:47,390
i got no right to growl

568
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,158
the whistle, she's on the prowl

569
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,898
without my wig, i look like an owl
hoo! Hoo!

570
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,835
- Oh, my god.
- Don't laugh at her.

571
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:00,943
Or it's a technical foul

572
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:04,546
a technical foul

573
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:05,910
a technical foul

574
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,753
davey will have to make the best of this.

575
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:21,498
- I guess i got to make the best of this.
- See. I told you.

576
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:26,797
But that shouldn't be too hard for him.
Even loners need company sometimes.

577
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,571
Shaving the chest.

578
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,939
Nobody needs a uni-brow.

579
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,871
This is going to scare her silly.

580
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,276
Yeah, it is.

581
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,850
Peanuts for me?

582
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:56,726
- Wish we were taller, eleanore?
- I can't reach the cobwebs.

583
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,229
- Thank you, davey.
- No problem, eleanore.

584
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,248
Good one, eleanore.

585
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:17,182
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Have a good day.

586
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,423
Good luck, old man.

587
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:31,326
Now i can understand wrapping
the cornmeal around the hot dog...

588
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,368
...but why the heck would they shove
this stick in here?

589
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,871
I'm getting exhausted
trying to cut around it.

590
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:41,669
You're supposed to hold the stick
and just eat the corn dog off of it.

591
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:45,010
How futuristic.

592
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,649
Oh, my god.

593
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:50,685
Zip up or you'll catch a throat cold.

594
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,651
Thank you.

595
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,023
Hey, benny!

596
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:59,526
Nice game against saint catherine's
today. How many buckets you score?

597
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:00,721
Fourteen.

598
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,025
You're gonna be league-high scorer, kid.

599
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,666
You just got to keep your elbows in.

600
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,531
That's my man.

601
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:19,305
Hey, you two, just doing circles.

602
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:23,719
Oopsy-doodle!

603
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,418
Yeah!

604
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,216
I haven't done that in a while.

605
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:35,092
Maybe i'm so excited about the banquet
tonight, it's giving me extra oomph.

606
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:40,326
You'll extra-oomph yourself right into
another seizure if you don't calm down.

607
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:43,802
He'll be all right. How'd you get
so good on the ice, anyways?

608
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:47,637
In the '50s i reffed youth hockey
for a couple of seasons.

609
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:51,337
Until a wrist shot caught him in the
back of the skull.

610
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,483
Nothing a little metal plate couldn't fix.

611
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,845
He was in a coma for three months.

612
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,282
I needed the rest anyway.

613
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,626
Could i get a lift from you, partner?

614
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,820
Sure.

615
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:14,131
So, davey, did you play the hockey
when you were a child?

616
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:16,363
No, hockey players get up too early.

617
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:20,668
This guy's sport always was and
always will be basketball.

618
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,243
Back in '81...

619
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,847
...he was the star of what is still
known to this very day...

620
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,678
...as the jcc miracle game.

621
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:29,977
Oh, my.

622
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,782
The jcc was down by 24 points.

623
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:35,890
The bad news is we stand no chance
of winning this game.

624
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:40,187
The good news is it's chanukah, so
you'll all get presents tonight anyway.

625
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,956
Speaking of presents...

626
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,533
...our parents come to all our games
even though we always lose.

627
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,031
So i was thinking...

628
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:51,197
...maybe tonight we could try to win one
for them. You know, as a gift.

629
00:41:51,375 --> 00:41:54,776
The only way that'll happen is if you
take all the shots.

630
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,775
Well, if you guys don't mind...

631
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,381
- it's okay with us.
- Go for it. You got it.

632
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,140
Let's win!

633
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,080
Where are your parents, anyways?

634
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:08,183
I don't know. Hopefully, out
getting me an atari.

635
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,364
All right, davey!

636
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,542
- Come on!
- Let's go!

637
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,449
We'll take that.

638
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,388
Not today.

639
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:56,032
That kind of shooting makes me
want to do the robot dance.

640
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,748
Nice story. You can stop now.

641
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:11,444
No, no, go on. Whitey, i'm mesmerized.

642
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,351
Can we just go? I'm cold.

643
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:17,459
I want to hear what happens next.
It's like a fairy tale.

644
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:22,588
Unfortunately, this fairy tale
doesn't have a happy ending.

645
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,972
Davey was wondering
where his parents were.

646
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:42,016
Turns out they were on their way
to the ball game...

647
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:47,519
...when a truck hit a patch of black ice
and swerved into oncoming traffic.

648
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:52,525
Mr. And mrs. Stone tragically
couldn't get out of the way in time.

649
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,521
I couldn't believe something
that horrible...

650
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,031
...could happen to a kid that nice.

651
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:03,330
He walked right through that door
and into foster home after foster home...

652
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:06,271
...until his 18th birthday.

653
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:13,715
Oh, my. You poor, poor boy.
What in heaven's name did you do?

654
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,213
Let's just get off of this.

655
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:18,012
He didn't know how to handle it.

656
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:22,283
What 12-year-old kid would?
He basically shut down.

657
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:38,931
Davey, i'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.

658
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:41,577
There's nothing to say.
My parents are dead.

659
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:44,679
Happy chanukah.
Now, leave me alone.

660
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:51,085
That's the saddest story i've ever heard.

661
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,499
I'm out of here.
I don't need this sympathy crap.

662
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:06,897
Maybe it's time you stop running
from your emotions.

663
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,262
I'm not. I'm running from two crybabies...

664
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:12,465
...who won't shut up about something
that isn't their business.

665
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:15,668
You know, i read recently
in reader's digest...

666
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:19,747
...that people who let themselves cry
when they're hurting...

667
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:22,247
...are often stronger than the people...

668
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:25,786
...who try to hold all their pain inside.

669
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:29,390
Did you read about a deformed referee
who spends 35 years...

670
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,425
...trying to win some stupid patch...

671
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:34,587
...so he can pretend people
actually like him?!

672
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:37,062
Which month was that in?

673
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:39,265
Take that back.

674
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:42,700
If they have an award for the
freakiest looking fraternal twins...

675
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:46,365
...who no one even gives a crap about,
you two are definitely winning.

676
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,444
But that patch thing ain't ever
gonna happen for you...

677
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:53,777
...because the truth is, nobody
in this town even knows you exist!

678
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,746
You're an animal.

679
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,080
And you're bald!

680
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,621
Not again!

681
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:04,922
You're not welcome in my house.

682
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,926
Good, your house sucks!

683
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,328
Do you have to be nasty to everyone
who tries to help you?

684
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:11,726
That's my problem.

685
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,435
He just a no-goodnik.

686
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:19,472
And i am the real kristi yamaguchi.

687
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:27,277
Wow. Just when you started to really
like davey, he has a butthole relapse.

688
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:30,850
Hey, fellas.

689
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,648
You know, eleanore really does
look like an owl.

690
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:35,982
Sorry.

691
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,924
Cheer up, eleanore.
Let's just get ready for the banquet.

692
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,798
It doesn't hurt to smell nice. Does it,
fellas?

693
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,666
You're a good deer.

694
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:56,142
Let's try the red wig. And please,
don't crap on my carpet.

695
00:46:57,381 --> 00:47:01,215
Well, while whitey and eleanore
are getting ready for the banquet...

696
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:04,377
...the moron is having
a party of his own.

697
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:07,212
And when people get in the state
that davey's in...

698
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:09,586
...they do really stupid things...

699
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:12,160
...like go to a mall that's obviously
closed...

700
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:15,854
...to yell at a woman who's obviously
not there.

701
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:19,493
Shut up!

702
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:25,238
Jennifer!

703
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:27,676
Jennifer!

704
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:31,312
What's the matter with the way i live
my life? Huh, jennifer?!

705
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,246
Where are you?! Home reading
your baby boy a bedtime story...

706
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:39,182
...while he sucks his thumb
and goes pee-pee on his blanket?!

707
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:40,981
Horseshit!

708
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:45,525
Look who finally showed up.
We've been waiting for you all night.

709
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:46,990
Who said that?

710
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,529
I said that. Everybody wake up!

711
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,256
This is not a rehearsal.

712
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:52,832
Numb-nuts is here.

713
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,160
Roger on that. Over.

714
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,272
Let's do this, people.

715
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,271
Just let me put my teeth in.

716
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,843
How do you like your java?

717
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,639
With a shot of whiskey.

718
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,409
Let's try it black instead.

719
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,551
That burns!

720
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:13,587
Wake up, kids.
Our hot and sour friend is here.

721
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:16,654
We're coming!

722
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,260
It's about time you got here.

723
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,193
I've been tossing and turning.

724
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:24,799
I know. I was watching you.

725
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:27,460
I mean, me too.

726
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,763
What the heck is happening right now?

727
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,306
Something that should have happened
20 years ago.

728
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:33,975
Time to cry, davey. Over.

729
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,372
What? Get out of here. I'm leaving.

730
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,946
You can run from whitey,
but you ain't gonna run from us.

731
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:45,615
We all heard what happened
at the skating rink today

732
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:50,692
when whitey brought up your sad past
you snapped and walked away

733
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:56,227
well, maybe they're onto something
that you should give a try

734
00:48:56,466 --> 00:49:01,062
go ahead and let it out
and have yourself a cry

735
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,466
let it out, davey

736
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:06,141
shut your wooden mugs

737
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:08,834
let it out, davey

738
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,707
would you check out her bezugs

739
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:16,147
you want me to deal with pain
well, "cheers" is what i say

740
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,516
this here stuff just numbs the pain
it don't make it go away

741
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,851
you try to act so tough

742
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,528
but you just live a lie

743
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:31,723
why don't you show your feminine side
and have yourself a cry

744
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,495
let it out, davey

745
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:36,603
i'll pour you down the sink

746
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,741
you gotta do it, davey

747
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:42,377
y'all can bite my dink

748
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:49,479
you labels and logos are wasting
your time making me sit here

749
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:54,680
'cause nothing you can say or do
will make me shed a tear

750
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:57,349
he possesses a strong spirit

751
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,358
and won't let down his guard

752
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:02,191
so now we'll bring in the big gun

753
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:05,660
his beautiful chanukah card

754
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:09,364
take it, davey. It might have money in it.
Over.

755
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:21,716
Happy chanukah to our wonderful son

756
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,780
you fill our lives

757
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,157
with joy

758
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:31,319
don't ever change

759
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:34,724
the way you are

760
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,233
you beautiful

761
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,733
twelve-year-old

762
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:45,874
boy

763
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,909
breaking and entering.

764
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,749
I knew you'd screw
up eventually, stone.

765
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:03,915
- I'm sorry.
- Save your sorries for the judge.

766
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,629
This is embarrassing.

767
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,976
- Come on, guys.
- Okay, sweetheart.

768
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,343
Don't be sad, mom. I can be your date.

769
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:32,118
You should let me be your date.

770
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:38,122
I may be dirty and smelly,
but in the dark, i'm just smelly.

771
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:42,288
Well, thank you, but he asked first.

772
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:46,124
Oh, my god. Slow down.
Come on. I'm scared.

773
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,864
Hey, why are we stopped now?
What are you doing? What's going on?

774
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:52,405
Who's out there?
Do we need to call the police?

775
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:55,907
Don't worry, eleanore. I promise
you'll have a good time.

776
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,674
All right, brother. Let's go win this thing.

777
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:11,093
You look like audrey hepburn if she was
four feet and weighed 300 pounds.

778
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,886
Thank you.

779
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,591
Watch the ice, eleanore. Don't slip.

780
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,892
It's all good, whitey.

781
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:22,836
Eleanore duvall? Is that you?

782
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,530
Why do you want to know?

783
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:26,264
What can we do you for, bub?

784
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,411
I've been waiting to see your sister
for many years.

785
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:32,409
Are you the kid who stole my wig?

786
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:35,107
Yes, i'm eli wolstan...

787
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:38,913
...and i've always felt bad about being
so thoughtless when i was young.

788
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:41,056
So i wanted to return this to you.

789
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:42,719
Thank you.

790
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:46,420
Feel better?

791
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,854
One more thing.

792
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,061
Now i feel better.

793
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:00,203
At least this one make me look pretty.

794
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:06,510
Attention all officers. Davey stone is
on the loose.

795
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:16,755
Last bus to new york
city now boarding.

796
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:29,866
Whitey, they were giving out lobster
bibs in the bathroom.

797
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:34,772
That's not a lobster bib, eleanore.
That's a germ protector for your tushy.

798
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,344
Okay. Well, i'll use it here.

799
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:43,582
My hiney is germfree and i love it.

800
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:48,017
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm mayor stuey duhy.

801
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,557
I'd like to welcome you to the
35th annual...

802
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,593
...youth league basketball
all-star banquet.

803
00:53:56,933 --> 00:54:00,869
For those of you celebrating christmas
tomorrow, merry christmas.

804
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,732
Merry christmas.

805
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,898
For those of you celebrating
the eighth night of chanukah...

806
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,737
...happy chanukah.

807
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,909
Happy chanukah.

808
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,438
Going to the big apple, son?

809
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,412
Yeah.

810
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,779
Business or pleasure?

811
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:18,645
Freedom.

812
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:22,085
I see. You're one of them
hippie-dippy fellas.

813
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,455
Everyone knows i like to start
these events with a joke.

814
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:28,460
But i've been so busy at the hardware
store this year...

815
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:33,534
...l've had no time to think of a great
one. But i thought of this driving here:

816
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,930
Knock, knock.

817
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,605
Who's there?

818
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,435
- Don't you.
- Don't you, who?

819
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,635
Don't you wish i hadn't been so busy
at the hardware store...

820
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:45,144
...and had more time to think
of a great one?

821
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:15,177
Mom, i didn't get that one.

822
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:18,836
I don't think anybody did.
People just try to be nice to the mayor.

823
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:22,010
It's gonna be a good night.
Let's get to it.

824
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:26,484
The award for most impressive growth
goes to a kid who began at 4-foot-2.

825
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:31,491
He is now about to take the stage
at his current height of 6-foot-5.

826
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,185
Donald hardy!

827
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:34,658
Get up here, you beanpole.

828
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:39,331
Saint ignatius is number one!

829
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:42,528
Hopefully that young man's getting
a weed whacker for christmas.

830
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,201
The mayor is very funny.

831
00:55:56,119 --> 00:56:00,215
Look at davey, inches
from a clean getaway.

832
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:03,654
But there's some things you
just aren't meant to get away from.

833
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,018
What the hey?

834
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:11,232
Whoa! Whoa! Hang in there, betsy!
We'll make it! Whoa!

835
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,169
Nice driving skills, pal.

836
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,034
That's the strangest thing
i've ever seen.

837
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,905
One thumbtack popped all eight
of my back tires.

838
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:29,717
Okay. I see what you're doing.

839
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,247
Who you talking to? Having one of them
hippie-dippy mushroom flashbacks?

840
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:37,392
I need to go apologize to someone
before i leave.

841
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:41,223
I know you hippies don't wear watches,
but it should be fixed in 30 minutes.

842
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:42,726
I'll see you then.

843
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,094
Run, hippie! Run!

844
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,765
I'm just here to say i'm sorry
to the little guy. I swear.

845
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,073
If i give myself a wedgie
will you believe me then?

846
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,782
Okay?

847
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,922
Glad we could work that out.

848
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,929
I can't believe i'm in the same room
as the mayor.

849
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,433
I can't believe how many rolls
you put in your purse.

850
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,265
It'll be a nice snack for february.

851
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,432
Ladies and gentlemen, this next award,
the dukesberry all-star patch...

852
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:31,808
...was created 35 years ago to recognize
people for their tireless work ethic...

853
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,778
...their unparalleled generosity...

854
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,784
...and their passion and dedication to
both the league and our fine community.

855
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:42,447
Your hands are sopping wet.
Don't be so nervous, whitey.

856
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,650
I'm not nervous. I'm excited.

857
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:48,661
I've been waiting 35 years
for this night.

858
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,510
- You see something?
- Just some deer doing a pyramid.

859
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:05,680
Okay, well, let's keep looking.

860
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,485
Good job, fellas.

861
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:14,346
Hand-picked by you,
the people of our fine town...

862
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:17,685
...i now present the 35th annual...

863
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:21,352
...dukesberry all-star patch award...

864
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:22,656
...to...

865
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,829
please let there be a miracle.

866
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,397
...tom baltezor.

867
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,334
Tom, come up here and get this sucker.

868
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:37,639
Attaboy, tommy!

869
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,934
We love you, tommy!

870
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:13,749
Nobody in this town even knows
you exist!

871
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:23,083
All you people can bite
my germfree booty!

872
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:29,593
Looks like i better do a lot more than
apologize. See you in 10 years, fellas.

873
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:35,832
When i was a kid playing youth
league ball for palmer episcopal...

874
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:37,769
...i dreamed of two things:

875
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:42,775
Learning to make a lay-up with my left
hand and becoming a multi-billionaire.

876
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:46,278
I think you all know which dream
came true.

877
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,413
Wow!

878
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:52,248
Sorry! That one caught me by surprise.

879
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:58,926
And even though i don't recall scoring a
point during my four seasons of play...

880
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,421
...the memories of the fun times
i did have...

881
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:06,261
...made it very easy for me to purchase
the new digital scoreboard...

882
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,928
...for the community center
earlier this year.

883
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,606
Thanks for the recognition.

884
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,470
- Thanks for the scoreboard!
- Thank you, tommy!

885
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:18,637
Excuse me! Can i just say something?

886
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:21,145
- There he is!
- Stone, what are you doing here?

887
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:24,444
Getting himself arrested, mayor duhy.
He broke into the mall.

888
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:27,145
I love it! Your ass busted!

889
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:30,018
Now you go to jail
and marry big, smelly man.

890
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,318
Stone, you screwed up for the last time.

891
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:35,656
That 10-year sentence i promised you
starts tonight.

892
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:41,503
Please, just let me speak for one second.

893
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,461
Are those tears in his eyes?

894
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:45,106
Finally.

895
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,332
Let the guy talk!

896
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,504
After all, it is the holidays.

897
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:57,007
She's right. And then we'll
send him up the river.

898
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:03,356
Okay, mrs. Triple nipple...
i mean, mrs. Selman.

899
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:06,653
Go ahead, mr. Stone. Let's hear
your parting words of wisdom.

900
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:11,357
I know you people don't like me or
care about my opinion, but here goes.

901
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:16,027
Tommy, nothing personal, but whitey
should have won the patch tonight.

902
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:18,833
You're all crazy for not realizing that.

903
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:23,342
Why would we give whitey duvall the
patch? So he could use it as a blanket?

904
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:34,549
That's the reaction i thought i'd get.

905
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:38,022
Everyone in this room has been
associated with whitey

906
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,752
through basketball or the mall

907
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:45,365
or various odd jobs he does around
town for free or at most a dollar

908
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,600
and i'm guessing 99% of you have
either laughed in whitey's face

909
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:53,205
or ruthlessly made fun of his feet or
voice or sister or shortness

910
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:57,210
when he wasn't looking

911
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:01,247
but the next time you'd see him, he'd go
out of his way to smile and wave at you

912
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:03,577
and ask about your mother's operation

913
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:08,246
because he, unlike us, cares
about someone other than himself

914
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:13,223
the reason i bring this up to you

915
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:18,390
is because i was the worst offender

916
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,866
of all

917
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,566
my life was simply going nowhere

918
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:30,579
then a tiny, little man
rushed to my side

919
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:35,083
he should've gotten a big thank-you

920
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:39,249
instead he got a port-a-potty ride

921
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:43,085
i was such a shithead

922
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,820
but he never quit on me

923
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:51,795
till i told him he was useless

924
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:55,333
and his sister was freaky

925
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:59,097
once when we were watching
sunday football

926
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:04,103
a fuzzy screen was all that
we could see

927
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,477
whitey came over with a hanger

928
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:11,176
and spent the game on top of our tv

929
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:14,855
and when the lightning struck him

930
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,953
he let out a wicked-loud yell

931
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:23,455
but we just turned up the volume

932
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:25,959
and ignored the burning smell

933
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,968
we should all rot in hell

934
01:03:29,872 --> 01:03:32,841
i went to high school with whitey

935
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:37,342
as a joke i told him to meet me
at the prom

936
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:42,146
when he got there i said, "i can't
believe you thought i was serious"

937
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:45,514
so he ran home crying and
slow-danced with his mom

938
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:50,021
what a crushing blow to whitey

939
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:53,320
i bet you wish you could take it back

940
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,855
how could you all be
so mean to whitey?

941
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,858
Sound to me like you are all on crack

942
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:02,161
huh?

943
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:06,364
Tonight whitey was
counting on this town

944
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:10,375
to show that we care

945
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:14,105
but the first time he really needed us

946
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,410
we weren't there

947
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:21,214
and on christmas eve
and the last night of chanukah

948
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:25,687
it's just not fair

949
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,377
i wonder if that guy

950
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:48,914
ever wiped his ass with
the wrong hand

951
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:50,544
yes.

952
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:15,169
I'm so sorry they hurt you, whitey.

953
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,903
We should go to the mall.

954
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:21,277
That place always makes me feel better.

955
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,247
But it's closed.

956
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:27,889
Maybe the night guard
forgot to lock the door again.

957
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,991
Well, if he didn't, we can at
least sit in front of it.

958
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,627
These are desperate times.

959
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:43,237
Let the door be open.
Please, just give me that.

960
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:45,969
Thank god.

961
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:50,601
This is the most beautiful place
i've ever seen.

962
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,647
It's like a sanctuary.

963
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:59,116
Eleanore, could you just give me a
second to say a few words in private?

964
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:03,122
Take as much time as you need, whitey.

965
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,498
Hey, mall, long time no see.

966
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:15,033
Fourteen hours to be exact.

967
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,465
If you haven't heard by now...

968
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,839
...i didn't get that patch i've been
telling you about for all these years.

969
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:26,537
In fact, i've been
kind of kidding myself...

970
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:29,876
...to even think i was in the running.

971
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:31,978
You see...

972
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:34,480
...the people of dukesberry...

973
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:38,457
...think i'm nothing but a joke.

974
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:42,525
So i was kind of thinking...

975
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:48,067
...maybe i should move to a town
where nobody knows who i am.

976
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:53,640
At least then they'd have a
reason not to acknowledge me.

977
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:57,507
I think eleanore might like florida...

978
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:02,811
...and i hear they got some pretty
amazing malls there.

979
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,483
You're not going anywhere.

980
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:10,853
Holy shit, did the mall
just say something?

981
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:14,060
No, it was me.

982
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:17,056
What do you want, stone?

983
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,529
I came to apologize, whitey.

984
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:24,201
Well, there's nothing to apologize for,
stone, because you were right.

985
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:26,875
Nobody does care about me.

986
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:30,672
I don't think that's true.
Do you, mr. Mayor?

987
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:36,714
Whitey, tonight for the first time
in years...

988
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:41,084
...your partner, davey stone, actually
did a good thing for this community.

989
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:43,917
What he do, steal beer for everyone?

990
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:49,228
No. He made me see how great whitey
is and how neglectful we've all been.

991
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:53,594
That's why i'm here, whitey.
I'm here to fix a big mistake.

992
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:58,933
It's your moment, whitey

993
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:03,601
you've waited oh, so long

994
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:09,148
it's your moment, whitey

995
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:13,351
we're here to right our wrong

996
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:18,117
for service to the league and this
community, i proudly present to you...

997
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:23,388
...the 35th annual dukesberry
all-star patch.

998
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:26,258
But this is tom's.

999
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:31,932
Mr. Duvall, the 35th all-star
patch is now where it belongs.

1000
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:36,804
I can't believe this is happening.

1001
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:38,771
And the 34th!

1002
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,814
And the 33rd!

1003
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:46,377
And the 32nd,
and the 31 st, and the 30th!

1004
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:47,782
- 29th!
- And the 16th!

1005
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,390
- And the 28th!
- And the 23rd!

1006
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:50,616
And the 27th!

1007
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:53,193
- Oh, whitey.
- And the 11 th!

1008
01:08:53,395 --> 01:08:55,124
- And the 25th!
- And the 18th!

1009
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:57,957
We love you, whitey!

1010
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:02,797
You stepped up for me, stone.
I don't know if i could ever repay you.

1011
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,339
Well, you can help me with my dream.

1012
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,633
You got a dream? What is it?

1013
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:11,141
To have someone wish me
a happy chanukah...

1014
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:14,510
...and feel as good as i used to
when my dad would say it to me.

1015
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,975
Happy chanukah, stone.

1016
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,809
Merry christmas, whitey.

1017
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:25,152
You know, stone, if my imaginary wife
and i ever have a son...

1018
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,829
...i hope you consider him a brother.

1019
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:31,489
Thanks, whitey. And i'll pretend
i never heard you say that.

1020
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:32,991
Appreciate it.

1021
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:38,333
It's your moment, whitey

1022
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:43,171
- enjoy, our tiny friend
- thank you. Thank you.

1023
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:46,246
Like the bavarian cream-filled donut

1024
01:09:46,515 --> 01:09:49,678
you ate last week

1025
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:52,218
thank you. Thank you.

1026
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:54,679
Would you three show whitey and i...

1027
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:58,384
...how to light the chanukah candles
at our house tonight?

1028
01:09:58,594 --> 01:09:59,720
You up for that, pal?

1029
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:01,759
And when benjamin falls asleep...

1030
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:05,228
...the both of you can play
spin the dreidel for tongue kisses.

1031
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:06,459
Sounds good to me.

1032
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:11,571
Now, go live happily ever after or i'll
dropkick the teeth out of your mouth.

1033
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:13,901
That won't be necessary.

1034
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:17,169
They make a nice couple.

1035
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,704
I never

1036
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:25,251
want this to end

1037
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,616
don't worry, folks. Whitey's okay.

1038
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:33,885
This is the happiest seizure of my life.

1039
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,087
See, i told you.
