00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,545
Ripped from DVD for http://www.opensubtitles.org by boso

2
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,356
So this is where I was born--

3
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,125
Riverview MedicaI Center,

4
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,496
right here in beautifuI downtown

5
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,434
Red Bank, New Jersey,
on the Jersey shore,

6
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,632
mere miIes from where I wouId grow up
in HighIands, New Jersey.

7
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,971
And then Iater on,
I'd come to Iive here

8
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,305
in my somewhat aduIt years.

9
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,969
View Askew offices are here.

10
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,378
Jay and SiIent Bob's Secret Stash
comic book store is here.

11
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:52,043
So I haven't gotten reaIIy far
from the hospitaI

12
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:56,282
where I was vaginaIIy
pooped into the worId.

13
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:58,688
The next big time I came back here

14
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,659
was aImost 29 years after I was born,

15
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,856
when I had my kid.

16
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,796
I made sure we were in Los AngeIes

17
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:07,924
when my wife was pregnant,

18
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,367
and I made sure that we
got on a pIane, got home

19
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,462
so I couId have her right here

20
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:13,665
at the same hospitaI I was born.

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,731
She couId be born a Jersey girI.

22
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,369
And I went through aII that troubIe

23
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:23,644
just so I couId use her
to do an intro for this DVD.

24
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,013
Isn't that shameIess?

25
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,883
I mean, I Iiked fucking my wife, too, but,

26
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:30,582
chiefIy, it was, Iike,
''We need somebody to be abIe

27
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,648
to kick off the Q and A.''

28
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,317
And she said, ''AII right.''

29
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,362
She gave me the courtesy roIIover,

30
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,296
puIIed up a cheek,
and a IittIe back insertion,

31
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,764
and it was aII good.

32
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,734
And it Ied to this.

33
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,711
HeIIo, New Jersey!

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,213
[cheering]

35
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,045
I'm Jennifer SchwaIbach.

36
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:03,317
And I'm HarIey Quinn Smith.

37
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,586
And we are here
to weIcome you and thank you

38
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,320
for coming from aII over the worId

39
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,419
to ceIebrate the 37th birthday

40
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,989
of a very beIoved husband and father

41
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,932
and, of course, fiImmaker.

42
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,368
And now, without further ado--

43
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,703
[together]
Introducing Kevin Smith!

44
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,579
So that's who I fuck.

45
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,558
[Iaughter]

46
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,798
And that's what happens when I fuck.

47
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,597
When I was a kid,

48
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,967
we'd drive past this theater aII the time,

49
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,302
and I'd be, Iike, ''Is he
reIated to Count DracuIa?''

50
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:36,412
I want to pIay you jazz.

51
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,883
That is, Iike, a ten-year-oId's joke.

52
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,513
StiII fucking works, man.

53
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,251
AII the jokes from my chiIdhood
stiII kind of fucking work.

54
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,623
The eye cup jokes stiII works.

55
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,458
One of my favorite jokes--
If you're from the area--

56
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,930
If you're from out of here,
you might not know CarveI--

57
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:57,936
CarveI Ice Cream.

58
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,734
Where, basicaIIy, they serve
soft-serve aII the time,

59
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,104
and they show you,
on the commerciaI,

60
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,369
- the dude where they fu--
- [audience member] Cookie!

61
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,276
Cookie Puss and Fudgie the WhaIe, yes.

62
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,110
Cookie Puss, which became
the unfortunate misnomer

63
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,810
of many girIs in high schooI.

64
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:15,513
AIways attached to
the fucking, Iike, you know,

65
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,285
suburban myth of ''I know this chick,

66
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,089
and she Iet a dog eat
a cookie out of her pussy.

67
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,355
A cookie.

68
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,421
She put a fucking chocoIate chip cookie
in her pussy, and the dog ate it.

69
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,966
We caII her Cookie Puss.''

70
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,264
And you beIieve that shit
'cause you wanna beIieve it.

71
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,065
You're Iike, ''What girI is this?

72
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,333
Because if she's so fucking desperate

73
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,706
she'II Iet a dog eat a fucking cookie
out of her pussy,

74
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,608
I got a shot, you know?''

75
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,510
But if you watch the commerciaIs for CarveI,

76
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:43,105
they aIways show
the soft-serve ice cream--

77
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,615
the hand with the cone and shit.

78
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,244
They puII the fucking crank,
and the ice cream twirIs out and shit.

79
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,753
So when we were kids,

80
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,550
the big joke was ''What's this?''

81
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,060
That's Tom CarveI taking a shit.

82
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,201
And my materiaI hasn't gotten
much better since then.

83
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:09,867
Just variations on that theme.

84
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:14,311
WeII, this is a big show for me
because it's hometown.

85
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,146
I was born 37 years ago

86
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,208
from today,

87
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,551
a few bIocks away at Riverview HospitaI.

88
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,250
[cheering, appIause]

89
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,100
That's kind of cooI, man.
Like, 37 years Iater,

90
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,262
I'm kind of up here sweating Iike a pig.

91
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,738
But it's wiId.

92
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,140
I mean, I don't know.

93
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,542
I can't teII you where I was
every other birthday in my Iife,

94
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,172
but I can teII you now
where I was on my 37th birthday.

95
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,945
I didn't get very far.

96
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,681
Just a few bIocks down.

97
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:59,486
I was born on August 2, 1970.

98
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:03,051
And it wasn't my birthday.

99
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,960
I mean, it was technicaIIy.

100
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,228
But before it was my birthday,
it was my brother's birthday.

101
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,166
My brother and I are born on the same day,

102
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,295
four years apart.

103
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,670
He was born in 1966. I was born in 1970.

104
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:19,201
My sister was born August 10, 1965,

105
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,143
which, if you do the math,

106
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,206
my parents Ioved to fuck
during eIection periods.

107
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:25,944
[Iaughter]

108
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:32,013
I just picture my oId man being Iike,

109
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:36,187
''We did our civic duty.
Now do your wifeIy duty.''

110
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,298
And my mother being, Iike, ''Jesus, Don.

111
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,065
''Just can't we fucking ever vote

112
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:52,135
without me having to do
shit with your dick?''

113
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,145
And if my father was anything Iike me,

114
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:56,147
I'm sure he was just, Iike,
''You don't have to do anything.

115
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:58,376
I'II just jerk off and you watch. Just--

116
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,554
Just Iook at it. Just Iook at my dick.''

117
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,182
The most shamefuI part
of my existence is that--

118
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,192
the fucking pIea for, Iike, just--

119
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,856
''You don't even have to touch it.
Just watch me jerk off.''

120
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,593
But I wouIdn't have a dick

121
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,965
without one key person in the audience.

122
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,903
I want to acknowIedge her,
'cause I wouId not be here tonight

123
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,337
if it weren't for my mom.

124
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,704
So, Mom, where are you?

125
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,538
[cheering, appIause]

126
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,623
But I guess for a whiIe,

127
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:39,749
my name wasn't gonna be my name.

128
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,817
My mom aIways toId me
that the day I was born,

129
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,385
her and my father were gonna
name me Brian David.

130
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,694
- [Man] Yeah, Brian!
- Yes.

131
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,792
After you, I'm sure. And--

132
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,234
[Iaughter]

133
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,873
And I guess somebody who had a kid
on the same day as my mom--

134
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,912
Is this right? Mom, where are you?

135
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,642
A friend of yours had a kid
aIso and named it Brian David.

136
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:07,174
What kind of fucking friend
is that? Like--

137
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,983
Are you even friends
with those peopIe anymore?

138
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,648
Are you reaIIy?

139
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,817
'Cause after that, I'd be, Iike, ''Fuck you!

140
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,728
That was ours!''

141
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,859
So she Iooked-- What was it?

142
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,232
Daddy Iiked the name Kevin Patrick.

143
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,032
Did Dad Iike
the name Kevin Patrick?

144
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:29,541
Not a singIe Kevin
in our famiIy, nor a Patrick.

145
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,543
My grandmother used to
teII me that aII the time.

146
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,909
She's, Iike, ''I don't know
where they got that name.''

147
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,242
Aren't any Kevins in the famiIy.

148
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,611
'Cause a Iot
of our famiIy members--

149
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,673
My sister Virginia is named
after my Aunt Virginia.

150
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,584
- My brother DonaId named after--
- His dad.

151
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,554
His father. Thank you.

152
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,090
Random name. And aIso,
since we were CathoIic,

153
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,398
it was tradition to pick a name
of a saint and shit Iike that.

154
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,406
So I went with-- I got named Kevin Patrick.

155
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,907
And Patrick is easy. Saint Patrick.

156
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,203
'Cause of St. Patrick's CathedraI,

157
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,335
and everybody knows that.

158
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,572
And St. Patrick,
the patron saint of IreIand and shit.

159
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,581
Drove the snakes out of IreIand.

160
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,947
Kevin-- Saint Kevin--

161
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,009
Not a Iot known about him.

162
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,020
And for a whiIe, when I
was in CathoIic schooI,

163
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,079
I was just, Iike,
''I'm named after St. Kevin.''

164
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:21,058
And even these fucking nuns
wouId be, Iike, ''Who's that?''

165
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,154
I was, Iike, ''It's true.
There is a St. Kevin.''

166
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,257
They're, Iike, ''Yeah, right, man.

167
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,928
I'm sure there's a Pope Smith, too.''

168
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,330
So after 37 years,

169
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,740
I decided to fucking Iook up some info

170
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,368
and see who St. Kevin was,

171
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,639
and--

172
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:53,720
and it's pretty fucking retarded.

173
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:54,817
There are-- You know,

174
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,293
when you hear of patron saints--

175
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,954
If you're not CathoIic,
you don't know about them.

176
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,464
If you're Jewish, you're just,
Iike, ''Who's Jesus?'' Um--

177
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,062
You know,

178
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,041
the saints are given patron--
They're given--

179
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,544
Saints are considered patrons
of certain things.

180
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,379
Like, you know, St. Lawrence
is the patron saint of comedy,

181
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,315
'cause he was a martyr.

182
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,616
Most of the saints were martyred
because they beIieved in Jesus.

183
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,122
AII you have to do is
get kiIIed beIieving in Jesus.

184
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,920
One day, they canonize you.

185
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,223
You have to have
a few miracIes to your name,

186
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,354
but it heIps if you died
in the name of Jesus.

187
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,022
Which means you couId be fucking,

188
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,259
die of a heart attack--

189
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:38,702
As Iong as you're, Iike, ''Jesus''--

190
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,797
St. Nuts-Deep, you know.

191
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:51,012
Patron saint of dying
in the midst of fucking.

192
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,313
So there are a bunch of them.
You know, Iike,

193
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,184
St. Christopher is the patron saint
of the traveIer.

194
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,950
So when peopIe drive around--
they're CathoIic--

195
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,753
sometimes you'II see
St. Christopher medaIs

196
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,917
on their dash and shit.

197
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,087
My mom used to wear one around her neck
whenever we traveIed.

198
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,425
Patron saint of traveIing.

199
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,331
It's a picture of a dude
hoIding a baby Jesus on his shouIder,

200
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,130
crossing a stream,

201
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,069
where you're, Iike, ''That's aII it took?''

202
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,232
It's not Iike, you know,
he's fighting fucking Iions

203
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,639
and swinging Iike Indiana Jones and shit.

204
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,974
It was a stream this thick,
and he's, Iike--

205
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:33,223
''I'm gonna be famous for that one day.''

206
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,021
St. Kevin, though--

207
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,655
''patron saint of crows.''

208
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,401
''Noted as the man

209
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,200
who did not aIways Iike
the company of men.''

210
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,239
Which, to me, says

211
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,077
the patron saint of
homophobes, you know? Just--

212
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,386
''I don't Iike to be around dudes.

213
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,820
They got dicks.''

214
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,717
''But was at home with the animaIs

215
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,024
as some of the Iegends
surrounding him show.''

216
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,871
So the patron saint
of homophobia and bestiaIity.

217
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,669
Here's some of the stories
they teII about St. Kevin.

218
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,873
''During a drought, Kevin fed his monks

219
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:32,111
with saImon brought to him by an otter.''

220
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:40,485
So, Iike, whenever peopIe write,
Iike, ''Dude, don't you think

221
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,722
fucking ScientoIogy is weird
and stupid and crazy?''

222
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:47,596
I just whip this out and--

223
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:51,102
I'm, Iike, ''This is what
some CathoIics beIieve.''

224
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,628
''When one of the monks
considered making gIoves

225
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,438
out of the otter's peIt,
it Ieft and never returned.''

226
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,402
Who fucking remembered that story?

227
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,142
Like, who wrote that story down, man?

228
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,877
Somebody was just, Iike, ''One time,

229
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,681
''he gave us a bunch of saImon
that the otters brought him,

230
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,222
''and then one of us wanted
to make it into gIoves,

231
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:17,160
and then the otter ran away.''

232
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,163
It just sounds Iike the patron saint

233
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,428
of, Iike, acid fIashback stories.

234
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,762
''Once, during Lent,

235
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,174
whiIe he heId his arms
outstretched in prayer''--

236
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,337
Like that, presumabIy.

237
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:38,110
''A bIackbird Iaid an egg in Kevin's hand.''

238
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:45,514
I couIdn't make this up.

239
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,081
Uh--

240
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,389
''He remained in that position

241
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,929
untiI the baby bird hatched.''

242
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,870
CouId you imagine-- AII right.
Like, if this happens--

243
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,133
You put out your hand
and a bird Iands in it,

244
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,004
Iike, that's fucking weird.

245
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,305
The bird Iays an egg in your hand?

246
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,709
Which, at first,
you're, Iike, ''Oh, my God.

247
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,270
The bird's shitting in my hand.''

248
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,975
But if you have
enough presence of mind

249
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,950
to be Iike, ''Oh, it's an egg.''

250
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,748
You know. And then the bird
presumabIy fIies away.

251
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,254
And then you stand there

252
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,292
for the entire gestation period,

253
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,327
waiting for that
fucking egg to hatch.

254
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,123
I mean, I don't know much

255
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,993
about fucking science
and shit and bioIogy,

256
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,761
don't mother birds Iay eggs

257
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,496
and sit on them for a Iong time?

258
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,901
This dude just had the power

259
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:37,136
to have an egg drop in his hand
and be, Iike, boop.

260
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,676
''Life.''

261
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,973
''A young man with severe epiIepsy

262
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,142
received a vision that he wouId
be cured by eating an appIe.

263
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,914
There were, however,
no appIe trees about.

264
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,888
Kevin, seeing the Iad's need,

265
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,424
''ordered a wiIIow to produce appIes.

267
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,693
That's not true. That--

268
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:10,174
I wasn't there.
This aII took pIace in, Iike, 600 AD.

269
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,541
I cannot fucking imagine
that that happened and shit.

270
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:18,777
Kevin just had
the worId's best pubIicist.

271
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:24,483
''St. Kevin's dick was 12 inches Iong.''

272
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,650
''A boar was being chased
by a group of hunters with their dogs.

That's my fucking namesake--
St. Kevin.

So fucking queer.

But not in that, Iike,
awesome cocksucking way.

291
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,071
Just queer, meaning odd. It's strange.

292
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,504
So who wants to start, man?

293
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,738
You ready to start? Ready to rock it?

He's got a point, dude.
Don't fuck it up.

299
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:46,026
You set the tone for the
whoIe evening and shit.

300
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,073
I just wanna say Happy Birthday, first off.

301

WeII, now you fucked up aIready.

302
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,235
Thank you very much.
Let's just put a moratorium on that.

303
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,247
Let's aII agree that it's my birthday.

304
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,078
Let's stop saying it.

305
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,640
Just to keep--
Thank you for doing it.

306
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,152
You're the first.
You'II be the onIy and shit.

307

Like my Iove.

308
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,754
So, no ''Happy Birthdays'' and shit.

309
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,817
'Cause fuck it.
It gets boring after a whiIe.

310
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,692
Everyone's, Iike, ''I just
wanna say Happy Birthday.''

311

It's, Iike, ''WeII, I just want you
to ask a fucking question.''

312
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,993
But thank you very much for that.
Rock your question, sir.

313
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:23,007
Okay, ever since you voiced
a character in Doogal,

314
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,236
have you ever thought
of writing a chiIdren's movie?

315
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,210
Something more for--

316
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,544
that HarIey couId watch
on a reguIar basis?

317
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,813
Ever since I-- Wait. What did I do?

318
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,857
Doogal.

319
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,415
Doogal. Oh, Doogal.

320
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:45,429
That's right. I did a voice
in Doogal and shit Iike that.

321
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,227
Which was strange,
'cause it was reaI, Iike, you know--

''Do you wanna do a voice
in a cartoon movie?''

324
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,636

He's Iike, ''That's why I asked.''

326

He's, Iike, ''You'II score huge
Brownie points with your kid.''

327
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,371
I was, Iike, ''Yeah, right on.
What do I pIay?''

328

He's, Iike, ''A farting moose.''

I was Iike, ''So, typecasting?''
He was Iike, ''Pretty much.''

330
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,788
Have I ever thought about
making a kids' movie?

331
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,660
No. Even though I got a kid,
I don't reaIIy think about it.

332
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,791
I just assume she'II start watching my movies
sooner or Iater.

333
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,301
We don't keep her from the movies

334

'cause the Ianguage
and shit Iike that.

335
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,039
She wouId just be totaIIy
bored by those movies.

I've tried a few times. 'Cause I'm Iike,

337
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,974
there's a joke or two in here
that she might enjoy.

338
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,512
And I'II put it on. I Iet her watch
the Clerks cartoon.

339
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,311
Even that, she was just, Iike,
''They just keep taIking.''

340
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:45,949
I was, Iike, ''Yeah, but there's an awesome
Schindler's List joke here, you know?''

341
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,423
So I don't know.

342
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,121
I didn't reaIIy think about
buiIding a career around

343
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,662
making fIicks for my kids.

344
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,425
I mean, Iike, Robert Rodriguez did that,

345
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,865
and now he's fucking
so insaneIy weaIthy.

346
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,926
So I guess I shouId've
given it some thought.

347
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,063
But I just don't have
those kind of fIicks in me.

348
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,335
I've been threatening for years
to write a chiIdren's book,

349
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,638
'cause I know I got
a chiIdren's book in me,

350
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,611
and I've been saying it
since the kid was born.

351
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,271
My wife was Iike, ''Get around to it

352
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,713
''so we can read her the book.

353
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,080
WouIdn't it be sweet
if you couId read her your own book?''

354
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,141
I said, ''Yeah, yeah, yeah.''

355
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,379
Now the kid reads herseIf and shit.

356
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,319
She's Iike, ''Now she can
read the book herseIf,

357
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,515
so get around to writing it.''

358
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,490
I was Iike, ''Yeah, yeah. TotaIIy. TotaIIy.''

359
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,493
I'm gonna wait untiI she's
in coIIege and shit,

360
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,462
and just rock her with the kids' book.

361
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,520
Be Iike, ''Check it out.''

362
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:31,035
She's, Iike, ''The Woof on the Roof.

363
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:36,336
I'm gonna go have some fucking sex
with my roommate, so''--

364
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:41,812
Thanks, SiIent Bob, you know.

365
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,609
But in terms of doing a kids' movie,

366
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,047
I never reaIIy thought about it.

367
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,711
I don't think I have the chops
for that kind of thing.

368
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,947
Don't think, you know,

369
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,014
that I'm the guy that you shouId
put in charge of a kids' movie.

370
00:19:55,327 --> 00:20:00,697
'Cause there was, Iike, at one point,
after Clerks got soId,

371
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,961
when we were going around
touring with studios.

372
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,833
They were, Iike, ''What do you wanna do
after your movie gets picked up?

373
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,599
''Sundance Studios wanna meet
with you. Do you have an idea?

374
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,436
What do you wanna do?'' Shit Iike that.

375
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,703
We went into Fox, I think it was,

376
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,268
and they were pitching us
movies to direct,

377
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,677
which I thought was weird,

378
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,146
'cause I'm, Iike, ''Did you
see the first movie?

379
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,979
You don't wanna give me a movie.

380
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,383
You wanna Iet me
make something of mine

381
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,182
that I won't fuck up too badIy.''

382
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,349
And the one they gave us
was one of the ones they pitched us.

383
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,950
Which, ironicaIIy, there's a movie
coming out caIIed Hot Rod.

384
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:29,994
But it wasn't that Hot Rod.

385
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:34,863
It was a movie caIIed Hot Rod
with MichaeI Jackson as the star,

386
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:40,701
in which MichaeI Jackson
hung around with a IittIe kid.

387
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:44,435
It's a true story. This is circa 1994,
so it was stiII kind of okay.

388
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,874
QuestionabIe.

389
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,343
PeopIe'd be Iike, ''Wow,
he hangs out with kids a Iot.''

390
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:50,540
But not Iike, ''Get your kids
away from him,'' you know.

391
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,814
He hangs out with a kid,
and he can morph into a car,

392
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:58,287
and then the kid wouId open
the car and get inside.

393
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,160
And back in 1994, I was Iike,
''I don't wanna do that.''

394
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:11,191
Now I wouId Iove to do that movie.

395
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,434
'Cause there's a fucking insaneIy good movie
to make about MichaeI Jackson

396
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,941
with IittIe boys entering him and shit.

397
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,803
And vice versa. Uh--

398
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,111
[audience groans]

399
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,842
Don't fuck-- Don't boo me.

400
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,682
I didn't fuck a kid.

401
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,019
[Iaughter, scattered appIause]

402
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,224
AIthough neither did he,
I guess, aIIegedIy.

403
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,788
But where there's smoke, there's fire.

404
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,356
And where there's a hand
on some kid's ass,

405
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,628
there's MichaeI Jackson.

406
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,133
But my kid has actuaIIy been,
Iike, bugging me

407
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,232
to do stories about our dogs,

408
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,245
'cause that's one of the things
that we share a common interest in.

409
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,678
'Cause she's 8 and shit,

410
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:56,907
and she Ioves me, and I Iove her,

411
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,212
but we're on two different waveIengths.

412
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,013
Don't reaIIy reIate to one another

413
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,419
Iike the way I reIate
to my friends and shit.

414
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,582
I can't be sitting there taIking to her
about, Iike, ''I got bIown Iast night.''

415
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,216
You know.

416
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,385
''It was aII right,

417
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,622
but not one of the best,'' you know.

418
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:13,221
''What's 'bIown'?''

419
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:16,933
''Ask Mom.''

420
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,838
''And don't ever do it.''

421
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,135
But the dogs are something

422
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,610
that we share a common interest in.

423
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,113
We got this IittIe dachshund
named Shecky.

424
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,209
Shecky.

425
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,152
And she is fascinated by Shecky.

426
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,712
She just wants me to make a movie
about the IittIe dachshund,

427
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,917
because she thinks
the dog is reaIIy wacky

428
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,152
and shit Iike that.

429
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,627
She's Iike, ''You can make a whoIe movie
just about Shecky.''

430
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,721
I'm, Iike, ''I don't know if anybody

431
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,494
''but you and I wouId
appreciate that movie.

432
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,593
''Even your mother
wouId hate that movie

433
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,264
'cause she hates Shecky.''

434
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,136
Because I wasn't supposed
to get the dog.

435
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,732
The dog was kind of a joke.

436
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,299
The dog grew out of a joke, man.

437
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,778
We were driving around--
me and Jen-- one day,

438
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,678
and somebody had a dog
hanging out the window.

439
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,740
You know, you drive around,
you see peopIe with dogs

440
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,580
Iike this out the window.

441
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,586
It was a IittIe dog-- wasn't a dachshund--

442
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,918
and it Iooked Iike it was beIted in--

443
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,049
'Cause you can buy
a seat beIt for a dog now.

444
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,684
So this dog wasn't
just a head out the window.

445
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,559
This dog was, Iike,
two paws on the windowsiII,

446
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,599
one Ieg aImost over the window.

447
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,600
This dude was making a turn and shit,

448
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,068
and the dog was, Iike,
hanging out the window.

449
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,765
We both saw it at the same time.

450
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,067
I said, ''Did you fucking see that?

451
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,608
''How fucked up is that?

452
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,643
''That dog, Iike, Iooks Iike
he's faIIing out of the car.

453
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,942
The dog's Iike''--

454
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,448
And nothing I say
makes my wife Iaugh-- very IittIe--

455
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,712
so when she Iaughs,
I tend to fucking, Iike,

456
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,754
run it into the ground and shit.

457
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,652
Kind of Iike the way I run my career.

458
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,055
So she Iaughed at it and shit,

459
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,422
and so it just grew from there.

460
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,619
She was Iike, ''That's so funny.

461
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:50,991
Why does he make that noise?''

462
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,495
I didn't wanna teII her that's the noise

463
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,759
that fucking R2-D2 makes
when he's shot.

464
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,765
So I just took credit for it, you know.

465
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:08,108
I was Iike, ''I wrote that.''

466
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,613
And that was the dog--

467
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,046
She was just Iike, ''That's so funny.

468
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,574
I was Iike, ''Can you just see fucking Shecky
hanging out the window?''

469
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,985
And she fucking thought that was briIIiant.

470
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,717
She was Iike,
''Why is the dog named Shecky?

471
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,918
I've never heard that before.''

472
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,722
I was Iike, ''That's a reaI name.
You never heard Shecky?''

473
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,626
She's Iike, ''No.''
She thought it was fucking hystericaI.

474
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:28,359
So every time I want to make her Iaugh,
I'd bring up a Shecky story.

475
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,924
Then I was Iike, ''We shouId
just fucking get a Shecky.''

476
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,402
'Cause we got dogs, right?
We got two yeIIow Iabs.

477
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:39,274
One is named MuIder.
One's named ScuIIy.

478
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:41,278
A IittIe gay, but whatever.

479
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:45,043
And then we went and got a chocoIate Iab
one day named Louie.

480
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,584
And so we had three dogs aIready--
three Iabs.

481
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,846
They're aII kind of--

482
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,854
Not huge dogs, but big dogs.
NormaI-sized dogs.

483
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:54,915
The idea of having a hot dog--
a wiener dog--

484
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:58,793
Which, you know-- Look, I Iove dogs.

485
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,162
And that kind of Iooks Iike Shecky.

486
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,791
Except she's not bIue.

487
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,268
But I aIways wanted a IittIe dog.

488
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,532
Not so I can carry it around
Iike Paris HiIton and shit,

489
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,437
but just to have, Iike a IittIe dog,

490
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,566
'cause I thought, Iike--

491
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,702
There was a book we read to HarIey
caIIed Big Dog and Little Dog.

492
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,872
It's about a very Iarge dog
that hangs out with a very IittIe dog.

493
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,439
Go figure.

494
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,043
And there was one version of the book

495
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,111
caIIed Big Dog and Little Dog
Wearing Sweaters.

496
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,589
That was the name
of the whoIe fucking book.

497
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:28,148
I used to Iove reading the kid that book,

498
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,160
'cause what a great titIe
that was and shit.

499
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,321
That's the titIe on the very first page.

500
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,865
Big Dog and Little Dog
are Wearing Sweaters.

501
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,460
Like that's their whoIe day--
pimpin' around in sweaters.

502
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,368
So I was, Iike,
''We shouId get a IittIe dog,

503
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,531
'cause then we'II finaIIy have
Big Dog and LittIe Dog and shit.

504
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,302
And the wife just
wouIdn't hear about it.

505
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,367
I was, Iike, ''Come on, man.
Like, a dog named Shecky.

506
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:49,072
A IittIe dachshund named Shecky.
A wiener dog named Shecky.

507
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,944
How awesome is that?'' She's Iike,

508
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,541
''Maybe if one of
these other dogs die, sure.

509
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,552
''But right now, we got three dogs.

510
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,884
''You don't need a fucking fourth dog,

511
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:00,447
''especiaIIy if it's just
for a punch Iine to a joke

512
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:03,722
that wasn't that funny to begin with.''

513
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,855
I was Iike, ''You Iaughed.''

514
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,093
So one day, the wife
was going out of town.

515
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:12,136
A friend of hers was having
a baby shower and shit,

516
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,398
and she was Ieaving me with the kid.

517
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,339
And I was testing the waters and shit.

518
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,138
I was, Iike, ''When you're gone,

519
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,973
we're gonna go out and get a Shecky.''

520
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:24,482
She was, Iike,
''Don't fucking do it, Kevin!

521
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:28,144
''I'm serious. I do not wanna
come home to a fucking dog.

522
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,345
Don't buy another dog.''

523
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,786
I was Iike, ''I wouIdn't fucking do that.

524
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:35,224
I'm just busting
your nonexistent fucking baIIs.''

525
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,421
So brought her to the airport--
me and the kid in the car.

526
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:39,827
Dropped her off on the curb,

527
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,126
and one hour Iike, ''Love you. Bye.''

528
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,963
Door cIosed. I was Iike,
''Let's go get Shecky.''

529
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,564
That's what the kid is awesome for.

530
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:54,976
The kid is just an awesome
IittIe fucking deviI on your shouIder

531
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:59,346
that's super-supportive
of aII your worst instincts.

532
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,817
Where you're just Iike,
''Let's get fucking ice cream.''

533
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,253
She's Iike, ''Yeah!''

534
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,120
So I was Iike, ''Let's go get Shecky.''

535
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:10,423
She's Iike, ''I'm right
behind you, Pop.'' You know.

536
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,963
So we hightaiI it to the fucking maII.

537
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,464
You'd imagine I wouId've Iearned,

538
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,056
because I bought a maII dog before.

539
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,227
MaII dogs just not great dogs and shit.

540
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,669
First dog we got was ScuIIy.

541
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,071
We got her 'cause Jen got pregnant.

542
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,302
We were taIking.

543
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,572
I was Iike, ''I don't know
if I'd be a good father.

544
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,614
I've never reaIIy taken care
of anything in my Iife.''

545
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,841
She was Iike, ''Me, neither.''

546
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,247
I was Iike, ''Maybe we shouId get a dog
to see-- you know,

547
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,445
''to train as parents and shit.

548
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,456
You couId, Iike,
breastfeed and whatnot.''

549
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:42,584
I can take pictures,
put it up on the Web.

550
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,721
Lucrative bestiaIity market.

551
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,492
So we decided to go out and get a dog.

552
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:50,728
She's Iike, ''We gotta get yeIIow Iabs,
'cause I grew up with a yeIIow Iab.

553
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,360
YeIIow Iabs are great around chiIdren.

554
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,098
That's the kind of dog we gotta get.''

555
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,197
I was so excited, 'cause I've never
had a dog in my Iife.

556
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:58,266
Had cats.

557
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,402
One day, a cat foIIowed me
home and shit Iike that,

558
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:01,672
which was awesome.

559
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,646
We were never aIIowed to have pets.
I was about 13.

560
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:06,343
This cat just hung out on
the front steps of our house.

561
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,215
It was kind of grown-up and shit.

562
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,651
So I kept feeding it.

563
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,279
FinaIIy, I said to my parents,

564
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,584
''Can't we just Iet
this cat in the house?''

565
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:14,625
They were Iike, ''Maybe
it's time he had a pet.

566
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,957
''He's fucking 13,

567
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:22,364
and he's interested in pussy,
so this counts.''

568
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,334
So we got that cat.

569
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,563
That Ied to another cat.
That Ied to another cat.

570
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,162
We had five cats in the house.

571
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,831
So we went from having no pets--

572
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,637
just a barren wasteIand of pets--

573
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,972
to having five cats in the house.

574
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,773
We became ''the cat house'' in town.

575
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:38,081
Cats are great, but they're just not--

576
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,845
They have no use for you
untiI you feed them.

577
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,887
Other than that, they're just,
Iike, very independent.

578
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,216
They're not Iike a dog

579
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:45,984
who'II come up and sIobber
aII over your face.

580
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,319
Man's best friend.

581
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:52,295
Cats are just, Iike,
man's compIacent roommate.

582
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,830
So--

583
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,230
It went far with the cats,
too, for some reason.

584
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:59,793
Like, my father, in his retired years,
used to work at the post office.

585
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:02,066
He'd finaIIy retired,

586
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,732
and then he had nothing
to do during the day.

587
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,799
One of the things he used to do,

588
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,606
and hated doing but did it reIigiousIy--

589
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,271
There were cats outside the house

590
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:10,678
'cause we had cats inside,

591
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,377
so other neighborhood cats
wouId hang out near our house.

592
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,918
They didn't seem
to be owned by anybody,

593
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:16,283
and I started feeding them.

594
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:19,517
So whatever Ieftovers we had--
put out for the cats.

595
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:24,619
And then it graduaIIy grew
into an army of 27 cats.

596
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:27,631
No Iie, dude. Like, you hear
about the famiIies--

597
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,133
Like, ''That's a house that has 27 cats.''

598
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,431
That was our fucking house.

599
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,597
PeopIe are, Iike,
''That house smeIIs Iike cat urine.''

600
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:37,038
My house.

601
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,941
My oId man, Iike, every day
at 3:00 and shit Iike that,

602
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,538
wouId kind of get this dishwashing bucket.

603
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,106
Big pIastic dishwashing bucket.
Tupperware-type thing.

604
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,709
A trough, Iike, this big.
FiII it fuII of, Iike,

605
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,812
fucking any kind of cheap dog food

606
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,254
we'd get at the food store,

607
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,587
staIe bread, water,
any Ieftover meats and shit.

608
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,684
Grind it up with his fucking hands,

609
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:58,092
bitching about it the whoIe time.

610
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:00,324
''These fucking cats.

611
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:02,958
I hate this shit, Grace. I hate these cats.''

612
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:06,470
And nobody ever made him do it.

613
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,699
It wasn't Iike my mother was Iike,
''You'II feed those cats,

614
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,104
or no anaI for you.''

615
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:14,669
It was nothing Iike that.

616
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,680
He just fucking did it. That was his thing.

617
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,739
But he hated doing it.
But he did it every day.

618
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,751
I wouId aIways have to
open the door for him.

619
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,980
He's Iike, ''Go get the fucking door.
Open the door.''

620
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:26,546
And he'd fucking wrestIe
with this big bucket fuII of cat shit,

621
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:28,524
bring it outside, put it downstairs.

622
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,891
And, Iike, out of nowhere,
Iike fucking ninjas,

623
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:33,453
27 cats just appeared.

624
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,022
Went around the trough just fucking eatin'.

625
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,193
It was fucking insane, dude, to watch.

626
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,328
And he wouId bitch about it
the whoIe way. ''Fucking cats.

627
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,270
''One day, something's gonna happen.
They'II aII be gone.

628
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,831
I can't fucking wait.''
Never occurred to him--

629
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:48,538
Just stop feeding them, dude.
They're onIy hanging out

630
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:49,978
'cause they know at 3:00 every day,

631
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:51,208
they're gonna get a meaI.

632
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,011
Just stop feeding the fucking cats.

633
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,346
But I think he secretIy Ioved it.

634
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:55,943
Then we had a big fIood

635
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,681
right when we were supposed
to start shooting Clerks.

636
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,848
I think we were supposed
to start shooting Clerks

637
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:03,087
in December of '92.

638
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,685
'91? '92? '92.

639
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:08,095
There was a big nor'easter storm
we had on the East Coast.

640
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:11,226
Our town, HighIands,
was kind of beIow sea IeveI to begin with.

641
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:14,032
The town fIooded.
We had tons of water in our house.

642
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:16,835
And kiIIed aII the fucking cats.

643
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:22,403
It was kind of sad,
but it was aIso kind of fucking funny.

644
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,072
'Cause they had nowhere to go.

645
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:27,015
They aII Iived in our yard
and other peopIe's yards.

646
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,451
After the fIoodwater subsided--

647
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,114
'Cause it was up to here
in my house-- the water.

648
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,680
We had a ranch house--

649
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,191
When you hear ranch house,

650
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,956
you're Iike, ''Wow, you had horses?'' No.

651
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:40,520
''Did you have a Iot of property?'' Not at aII.

652
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,158
A ranch house is just
a one-fIoor house.

653
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,794
So we had water up to here
in our house and whatnot.

654
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:49,772
So I was sIoshing around
in the house in fucking water.

655
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:54,676
So anybody outside on four Iegs
was just, Iike-- You know.

656
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,340
Trying to fucking keep their head
above water and shit.

657
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:58,541
When the water subsided,

658
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,914
we wouId be finding cats
for the next month.

659
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,953
We'd find cats-- It's a true story.

660
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,854
It's sad but kind of funny.

661
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,357
Uh, neighbors wouId be Iike,

662
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,189
''We found five of your cats under our house.''

663
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,525
We'd be Iike, ''WeII, those weren't
technicaIIy our cats.

664
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,622
They were just cats outside
that we fed a Iot.''

665
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,294
The neighbor's Iike, ''Yeah,
that makes them your cats.

666
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:22,305
''CouId you fucking get a Hefty bag
and get them out of there, pIease?''

667
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,965
There was one cat across the street--

668
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,010
Like, was cIimbing onto a fence--

669
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,409
Not Iike a chain Iink fence,

670
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,140
but, Iike, covered in wire and shit.

671
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:31,772
I don't know what they caII
those kinds of fences.

672
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,441
Look Iike a waffIe kind of.

673
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,281
He had one paw Iinked in

674
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,548
and the other paw grasping onto the top,

675
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,783
and he had bitten onto
the fence with his mouth.

676
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:43,054
So he was Iike-- Dead.
Frozen Iike that.

677
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,391
So the rigor had set in.

678
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:49,126
My mother's Iike,
''Get that cat off the fence.''

679
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,466
I was, Iike, ''Why me, man?
They're not my cats.''

680
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:54,800
She's Iike, ''They're not my cats, either.''

681
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:56,032
I'm Iike, ''They're Dad's cats.''

682
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,974
She's Iike, ''You gonna teII your father
to take that dead cat off the fence?

683
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,807
He's finaIIy got some fucking peace.''

684
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,870
So I had to go over and try
to take the cat off.

685
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,711
The cat had just become
part of the fence.

686
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:08,877
It was fucking rock soIid and shit. Just--

687
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,387
Eyes open in terror. Just--

688
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:17,486
Looking at me Iike, ''Why didn't
you save me from the fIood?

689
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:20,998
''You couId've opened your door, man.
You feed us.

690
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,533
There's a responsibiIity.
We were yours.''

691
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,398
I'm Iike, ''You weren't mine.

692
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,737
We have cats inside. I'm sorry.
We couIdn't take aII''--

693
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:32,436
Having a discussion
with a dead cat on a fence.

694
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,172
So never had a dog. So, finaIIy,

695
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,907
Jen gets pregnant and whatnot.

696
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,074
I'm, Iike, what a great idea. Get a dog.

697
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,516
I can finaIIy do dog, Iike I never had.

698
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:45,044
So we went to the MenIo Park MaII,
go to the pet store,

699
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:46,715
and we're Iike, ''Do you guys
have any yeIIow Iabs?

700
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,782
We're Iooking for a yeIIow Iab puppy.''

701
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,988
The Iady's Iike,
''Oh, we have one. Over there.''

702
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,930
We go down the Iine.
There's aII cute IittIe dogs and shit.

703
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,491
And there's this one dog
which kind of Iooks Iike

704
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:01,060
it was painted to be a yeIIow Iab.

705
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,808
The biggest dog in the pIace,

706
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,003
Iike it had gotten there
when it was a puppy,

707
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:10,275
and peopIe just kept passing
it over and passing it over.

708
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,612
So it was in this IittIe cage
that they put the puppies in,

709
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:16,346
but was now, Iike,
kind of an adoIescent dog.

710
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:20,187
So it was Iike this.

711
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:23,318
''Can you take me out?

712
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,761
You have any interest
in a fucking yeIIow Iab?''

713
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,765
So we're Iike, ''Let's Iook at that dog.''

714
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,767
Opened the cage, that dog, Iike--

715
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,167
Like we'd invented fucking breathing
and dog food.

716
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,966
The dog was aII over us.

717
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,633
Just so in Iove instantIy and shit.

718
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:41,166
It was the onIy one there.
We were kind of impuIse buying.

719
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,577
We're Iike, '' AII right,
I guess we shouId get her,''

720
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,876
but she's bigger than a puppy.''

721
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,746
And I'd never had experience
with puppies.

722
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,649
But I was Iike, ''Is this
how big they come out?''

723
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,211
Jen's, Iike, ''No.
UsuaIIy they're smaII and IovabIe.

724
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,451
Not Iike this.''

725
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:57,494
So we got her anyway
and took her home.

726
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,120
Tried her on for about a week.

727
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,598
After a week, we were both
Iike, ''This sucks.''

728
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,635
Like, this thing's needy and shit.

729
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,364
Like, wants to eat, wants to go out,

730
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,668
wants to pIay.

731
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,107
Let's get another dog.

732
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,737
That way, this dog
couId pIay with that dog

733
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,839
and Ieave us the fuck aIone.

734
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:24,149
ExceIIent training for parenthood.

735
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:27,020
So we decided to go get another dog.

736
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,524
This time, we weren't gonna
buy it at the maII.

737
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,562
'Cause this one was sIightIy retarded.

738
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,722
Aside from just being
oversized and whatnot,

739
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,392
ScuIIy's just not right in the head, man.

740
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,526
She's just reaIIy fucking dumb.

741
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,730
Some dogs are kind of goofy dumb,

742
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,363
but yeIIow Iabs
are supposed to be reaI smart.

743
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,876
They're the dogs they train
to drag bIind peopIe around.

744
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:50,346
This dog you wouId
never want to hook up with a bIind person.

745
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:53,349
Or a Iiving person. Just not--

746
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,510
Not reaI good at anything
and just aIways has

747
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,781
a dopey fucking expression on her face.

748
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,847
Like, fuII of Iove
but just fuII of shit, too.

749
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:04,884
Just reaI-- Just--
[siIIy noises]-- You know.

750
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:09,194
That's my impression of ScuIIy.

751
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,360
Just dumber than a box of rocks.

752
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,801
So we decided, I guess,

753
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,896
maybe the maII dog's a bad idea, man,

754
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,440
'cause this one's stupid,

755
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,237
and she shits where she shouIdn't.

756
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,642
You're supposed to
train them to do that.

757
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,270
We didn't know that.

758
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,837
But that's not what made her stupid.

759
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,941
She was just fucking born retarded.

760
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,781
I don't think she was a yeIIow Iab.

761
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,343
We kept asking the person at the pet store,

762
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,649
''Are you sure this is a yeIIow Iab?''

763
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:36,182
She's Iike, ''Oh, yes. Lab-Iike. It's yeIIow.''

764
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,390
She's definiteIy some kind
of crossbred dog. Not fuII Iab.

765
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:43,194
'Cause then we finaIIy met
what a reaI Iab is.

766
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,360
We decided not to go back to the pet store
and get another dog.

767
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,233
We decided to Iook for a breeder's kenneI.

768
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,796
There's one in MiddIetown,
on the highway, I aIways pass.

769
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,401
''Breeders KenneI.
Certified Puppies. Pedigreed Puppies.''

770
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:55,308
So we went in to get that dog.

771
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,212
Now, I was fucking bIown away
when we bought ScuIIy,

772
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:01,149
because the dog was 600 bucks.

773
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,086
I was just, Iike,
who the fuck pays for dogs?

774
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,419
Because don't they just
throw that shit away

775
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,082
at the A.S.P.C.A. or whatever?

776
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,218
Like, at the kenneI--

777
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,319
If the dogcatcher picks up a dog,

778
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,795
they hang out for a week.

779
00:37:13,864 --> 00:37:15,991
If they don't get adopted,
they chuck them out.

780
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,331
You'd imagine we can just
go get one for free.

781
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,165
Jen was just Iike, ''YeIIow Iabs--

782
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,866
''They don't chuck out yeIIow Iabs.

783
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,703
You gotta go buy dogs Iike that.''

784
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,709
So when I went to the pet store
and bought ScuIIy,

785
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,210
and they said, ''600 bucks,''

786
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,769
I was Iike, ''You're out
of your fucking mind.

787
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:33,248
I can go get fucking 16 dogs
for Iess than that, man.

788
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:36,047
Ones they're just gonna
burn in a week, so''--

789
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,020
[audience members]
Aww!

790
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,756
I hate to break it to you,

791
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,292
but that's what they do with those dogs.

792
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,419
Everyone's just, Iike, ''Oh,
the puppy kenneI and shit.''

793
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,395
If they don't fucking
get rid of them, they're, Iike--

794
00:37:57,408 --> 00:38:01,606
But aII dogs go to heaven,
so it aII works out.

795
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,512
So I was Iike,
''600 bucks, man! Come on.''

796
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,050
She's Iike, ''This is training
for parenthood, so 600 bucks--

797
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,745
What are you worried about?
600 bucks is nothing.''

798
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,787
I was Iike, ''Yeah, you're right.
600 bucks, I guess. Whatever.''

799
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,517
So I was going into the kenneI

800
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,752
expecting to pay roughIy
the same fucking thing.

801
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:18,124
Maybe Iess, because this dog
wouId be smaIIer than ScuIIy,

802
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:21,130
'cause ScuIIy was aIready
aImost haIf grown-up.

803
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:23,928
So we went in, and they
had these beautifuI IittIe Iab puppies

804
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,491
that are, Iike, this big
and shit Iike that.

805
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,831
You couId just
put them in your mouth,

806
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,099
you Iove them so much.

807
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:32,540
I Iove you.

808
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,544
Bunch of them skittering around and shit.

809
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,376
Just aII dopey, running into
one another, pIaying and shit.

810
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,712
Jen found one, picked it up.
Said, ''Oh, I Iove this one.''

811
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,376
It was a IittIe boy. We had a girI,

812
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,714
so we're Iike, ''Let's get a boy.''

813
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,017
We had a ScuIIy. Let's get a MuIder.

814
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,183
So she was Iike,
''This is the one I want.''

815
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,692
I was Iike, ''Right on.''

816
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,387
So took it up to the counter,
sIapped it up there.

817
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:52,827
''How much?''

818
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:57,891
Chick was Iike, ''$6,000.''

819
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:02,064
I was Iike, ''You are out
of your fucking mind, man!

820
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,336
I just bought a dog for 600 bucks
just Iike this!''

821
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,240
She's Iike, ''Not Iike this.
This is a pedigreed dog

822
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,972
''bred by two compIeteIy separate--

823
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,479
''Not inbred, doesn't come
from a puppy farm.

824
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,641
''They wiII have no hip dysphasia.

825
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:17,177
''They wiII be abIe to make
your coffee in the morning.

826
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:20,052
''This dog was bred for success.

827
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:21,318
''This is the perfect fucking dog,

828
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,882
''and you pay for quaIity.

829
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,689
''That's what this dog costs.
If you don't want it, fine.

830
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,320
Somebody eIse wiII buy it.''

831
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,365
And Jen I hadn't known
too Iong at this point.

832
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:31,060
We were onIy in the second
month of our reIationship.

833
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,865
So I'm Iooking over at her,
and she's, Iike-- You know.

834
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,667
I don't wanna be the guy

835
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,367
who's Iike, ''You can't buy that fucking dog!

836
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,740
Let's get out of here!'' You know.

837
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:44,144
So I was just Iike,
''AII right. Fucking fine.''

838
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,614
So I sheIIed out for the fucking dog.

839
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,378
Worth every penny.

840
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,682
Just insane-- insane
how fucking good that dog is.

841
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,246
MuIder is an amazing fucking dog.

842
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,656
MuIder's the most human
fucking dog, I think,

843
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,920
that has ever fucking Iived.

844
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,723
You know, Iike they taIk about Lassie.

845
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,787
Be, Iike, ''Timmy's in what?
Timmy's in the weII?''

846
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,595
Lassie's a made-up character.

847
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:07,569
Fucking MuIder is reaI.

848
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,435
Based on a made-up character, but...

849
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:13,739
But just so insaneIy fucking smart.

850
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,109
And so empathetic and shit Iike that,

851
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,511
knows your moods and whatnot.

852
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,516
We can fucking get MuIder
away from doing bad things

853
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,211
just by going ''Ooh.''

854
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,846
MuIder use to do something remoteIy bad,

855
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:29,484
and we'd be Iike, ''Ooh,''
and he'd be Iike, ''Oh.''

856
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,289
And not fucking cower in fear

857
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,624
Iike he's gonna get hit, but just be--

858
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,186
you know, MuIder wouId be jumping
up on the couch,

859
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,391
and we'd be Iike, ''Ooh.''

860
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:36,592
We didn't even yeII,

861
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,998
Iike, ''MuIder, get off the fucking couch!''

862
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:41,970
We'd just be Iike, ''Ooh,''
and he wouId be Iike...

863
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,064
And just suIk in shame and shit.

864
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:50,705
Like, ''I'm better than this.''

865
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,113
''You're right. I shouIdn't
be up on the fucking couch.

866
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,378
''That's my bad.

867
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,613
''Can I do something to make it up to you?

868
00:40:56,687 --> 00:41:02,956
Here's your $6,000 back.''

869
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,325
He's just a fucking good dog, man.

870
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,556
ReaI fucking good.

871
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,121
You know, so good
that he makes the other one

872
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,361
Iook even fucking worse and shit.

873
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:12,561
Where you're just Iike,

874
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,796
''Oh, you're just-- You are fucking--

875
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:16,339
''You are a goIden gift
from the Lord HimseIf.

876
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,035
''What the fuck happened to you?

877
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:22,943
Take a page out of this guy's book.''

878
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,038
And for years,
we had ScuIIy and MuIder.

879
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:27,140
And ScuIIy we had fixed and shit

880
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,412
because we didn't
want to have any puppies.

881
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,885
MuIder we didn't have fixed

882
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:33,117
because he never showed
an interest in sex whatsoever.

883
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,385
And if you spend
your whoIe Iife with ScuIIy,

884
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:38,360
it's easy to know why.

885
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,659
Because I'm sure he's just
Iike, ''I'm not gonna fuck her.

886
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:45,498
She's retarded.''

887
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:46,934
Never showed an interest in sex,

888
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,096
and we never had to have him fixed.

889
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,730
MuIder got to keep his nuts and shit.

890
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:50,899
And I guess for Iabs

891
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,466
you're supposed to get rid of their nuts
because it heIps--

892
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:54,738
I mean, if they have their nuts,

893
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:55,938
cancer kind of breeds
better or something.

894
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,537
I don't know. You hear some shit.

895
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,310
But I was Iike,
''Let him have his nuts.

896
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,044
He's got nothing eIse in Iife.

897
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,676
''He's not aIIowed on the couch,

898
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:03,913
''We're aIways 'oohing'
at him and shit.

899
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,082
Just Iet him keep his goddamn baIIs.''

900
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:08,556
And it was never a probIem.

901
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,856
He never tried to fuck ScuIIy,
never showed an interest.

902
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,953
Other girI dogs waIked past and shit,

903
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,261
he was never Iike ''uhh,'' you know.

904
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,267
Just asexuaI as a motherfucker.

905
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:21,395
The onIy time he showed any interest
in sex whatsoever,

906
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:25,101
EIiza Dushku came to our house
with a dog and it was her dog,

907
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,608
and it was a boy dog...

908
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:28,736
Yeah!

909
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,747
And MuIder was aII over
that fucking dog, man.

910
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:35,774
Not just sniffing its ass, but just Iike...

911
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,252
And we were Iike, ''MuIder's gay.''

912
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,879
You know?

913
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,516
He has no interest in ScuIIy,
he wants to fuck this boy dog.

914
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,617
But I'm sure he was just Iike,
''My options are Iimited.

915
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:45,992
''It's fuck her or fuck him.

916
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:52,059
And I'II fuck him because that sucks.''

917
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:54,400
Never showed an interest in sex
beyond that fucking dog,

918
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:55,631
and that dog wasn't around very much,

919
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:58,266
so it never occurred to us
to get him fixed or anything Iike that.

920
00:42:58,342 --> 00:42:59,639
We just thought he was over it,

921
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,406
because at this point he was seven,
aImost eight years oId.

922
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:04,709
And so we thought
he was beyond sex.

923
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,909
When we got Louis--
Louis was a girI dog.

924
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,976
Louis was Iike a fucking
post-New Year's Eve party purchase

925
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,043
on January 1st.

926
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:14,557
This is the danger of opening a maII
on New Year's Day.

927
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,354
Sitting around, kind of hung over--

928
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,793
me and Jen and Shay taIking about dogs

929
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,830
and Iike, ''WouIdn't it be
great to get a chocoIate Iab?''

930
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,559
[imitates inhaIing]

931
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,195
[stoned voice]
''It wouId.

932
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,705
'''Cause it wouId be Iike

933
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:36,508
a reverse Oreo thing going on.''

934
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,912
And after two hours of fucking drunken,

935
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:41,747
hung-over, high discussion
about getting another dog,

936
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,287
Jen was just Iike, ''Let's do it!

937
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,482
We're aduIts now.
Let's get another dog.''

938
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:49,025
And I was Iike, I can't
beIieve she's saying this.

939
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:53,052
It wouId have been more--
Iess shocking if she had said,

940
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,121
''Let's me, you, and Shay
fuck right now.''

941
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:57,360
I wouId have beIieved that.

942
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:59,334
For her to say, Iike,
''Let's get a third dog,''

943
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,667
I was just Iike,
''What are you, fucking high?''

944
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:04,674
And she was.

945
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,710
Louis turned out okay, and Jen was Iike,

946
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,745
''That's it. Three dogs.
No more,'' and shit.

947
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,339
So Jen takes off.

948
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,279
I say to HarIey, ''Let's go buy Shecky.''

949
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,317
We go to the pet store--

950
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:17,479
same pet store where we bought
Louis the maII dog--

951
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:19,112
they had one dachshund girI.

952
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,918
And I didn't want to get
a boy because, you know,

953
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,016
they fucking piss aII over
and shit Iike that.

954
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:24,822
It's Iike, ''Let's get a girI.''

955
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:26,123
So we went and got a girI and shit.

956
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:27,390
And we're pIaying with her.

957
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:30,092
You know, you get to
test drive it in the store.

958
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,293
PIaying with the dog,

959
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:32,426
and the kid's Iike, ''I Iove her.

960
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,970
I Iove Shecky!'' and shit Iike that.

961
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,302
I was Iike, ''I Iove her, too.
This is gonna be awesome.

962
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,399
Thank God your mother's not here.''

963
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:43,879
Jen caIIed on my ceII phone
to teII me she had Ianded.

964
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,438
Because she was onIy going
to San Francisco.

965
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,178
So I was Iike, ''HeIIo?''
She was Iike, ''Hey, I'm here.''

966
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,583
I was Iike, ''Great. You're safe?

967
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,177
Was it a good trip?''
She's Iike, ''Yeah.''

968
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:52,745
In the background you just hear ''Yip.''

969
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,294
And she was Iike, ''What was that?

970
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,197
And I was Iike, ''That's MuIder.

971
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:05,701
''It didn't sound Iike MuIder.

972
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,430
And I was Iike, ''No. It totaIIy is.''

973
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,233
She's Iike, ''Where's HarIey?''
I was Iike, ''HarIey's here.''

974
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,773
And HarIey's Iike,
''I Iove you, Shecky.

975
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:12,900
And she's Iike, ''Did she
just say 'Shecky'?''

976
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:20,815
She was Iike, ''You're not fucking
buying another dog, are you?''

977
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:24,047
And I was Iike, ''WeII, not yet.''

978
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:25,884
She's Iike, ''You went
to the fucking pet store.

979
00:45:25,956 --> 00:45:27,355
You're at the pet store right now.''

980
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:29,449
I was Iike,
''No. We're just Iooking.''

981
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:31,517
She's Iike, ''You can Iook
aII you want, Kevin.

982
00:45:31,595 --> 00:45:33,028
Do not bring another dog home.''

983
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,621
I was Iike, ''I won't, man. I won't.''

984
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:35,892
She said, ''You're buying it, aren't you?''

985
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:38,992
And I was waiting for the chick
to hand my credit card back.

986
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,798
'Cause my wife's got big ears
and they're fineIy tuned, man.

987
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,673
She can hear the swiping
of a credit card.

988
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,804
And she's Iike,
''I can't fucking beIieve you.''

989
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,212
I said, ''It'II be fine.
Don't worry about it, man.

990
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:54,045
''I'm not reaIIy going through with it.

991
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,552
It was just an exercise for
the kid because it's funny.''

992
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,281
And she's Iike,
''Don't bring that dog home.''

993
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,754
I was Iike, ''I won't.''

994
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:04,192
Hung up, put the dog
in a box to traveI home.

995
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,560
ImmediateIy, it just started yeIping.

996
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:10,031
And I was Iike, ''Fuck.

997
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,501
Why is this dog so needy?''

998
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,231
So I was Iike, ''You gotta
hoId Shecky, HarIey,

999
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:16,670
''because she's aII barking and shit,

1000
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:18,002
and she don't want to be in that box.

1001
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,565
She's scared, maybe, or something.''

1002
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:22,976
She's Iike, ''WeII,
I don't want to hoId it. She's scratchy.''

1003
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:26,072
And I was Iike, ''I thought you had my
fucking back an hour ago, man.''

1004
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,448
You wanted Shecky
and we were gonna have fun

1005
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,146
and make fun of her and shit, you know?

1006
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,211
Because that the whoIe reason
to get a hot dog dog--

1007
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:36,953
just to point at them and be Iike,
''Isn't that fucked up?''

1008
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,892
We didn't even get a reaI dachshund.

1009
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,522
We got a miniature dachshund,
which I didn't know.

1010
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:42,758
I just saw the sign
that said ''dachshund.''

1011
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:43,925
I was Iike, ''Give me that.''

1012
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:45,093
And when I got home,

1013
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,864
and Jen was just Iike,
''This is reaIIy smaII.''

1014
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,165
I was Iike, ''WeII, it's a puppy.''

1015
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:49,398
She's Iike, ''WeII, it's two months oId.

1016
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,531
It shouId be bigger than this.''

1017
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:51,835
I'm Iike, ''I don't know.

1018
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,001
They're wiener dogs.
How big can they get?''

1019
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:56,102
''Look at her. Isn't it fucked up?''

1020
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,670
She's Iike, ''Give me the receipt.''

1021
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,443
She's Iike, ''This is
a miniature dachshund.''

1022
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:00,676
I'm Iike, ''What does that mean?

1023
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,184
Aren't they aII smaII
when they come out?''

1024
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,846
She's Iike, ''It means it'II never get bigger
than this.

1025
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,253
I was Iike,
''You're fucking shitting me.

1026
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,915
You see how smaII this dog is?''

1027
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,489
You can IiteraIIy
put Shecky in your mouth.

1028
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:13,689
Not the whoIe dog,

1029
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,130
but just the head wouId
be popping out Iike...

1030
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:18,700
So I was Iike, ''Jesus Christ.''

1031
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:21,237
I fucked up and I got a dog
that's never gonna get big.

1032
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,274
A defective fucking weird IittIe dog.

1033
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,638
BoundIess fucking energy,

1034
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,643
won't Ieave the other fucking dogs aIone.

1035
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,440
Won't Ieave us aIone and shit Iike that.

1036
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,707
Loves fucking MuIder.

1037
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,749
Loves to jump up
and grab MuIder's ears.

1038
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,841
She jumps up, grabs his ear, bites,

1039
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,385
and then faIIs to the ground.

1040
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:39,445
So MuIder spends most
of his day Iike this.

1041
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,496
You know, just--

1042
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,122
And MuIder tries to put on a mean face.

1043
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,632
Every once in a whiIe

1044
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,032
you'II see him put on a mean face
where he goes ''Uhh,''

1045
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:54,332
but she don't buy it.

1046
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,235
So she Iives to torment the dog,

1047
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,364
is constantIy biting his face,

1048
00:47:57,441 --> 00:47:58,601
constantIy biting, jumping,

1049
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:00,006
grabbing his hair, faIIing down,

1050
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:02,272
and yanking hair
out of his body and shit.

1051
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:06,077
And he was has this Iook of,
''Dude, I'm in my goIden years.

1052
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,583
''You reaIIy had to bring this home?

1053
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,113
This is fucking horribIe.''

1054
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:13,486
But MuIder got his fucking revenge

1055
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,184
in a weird way

1056
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:18,558
because Shecky was
too IittIe to get fixed

1057
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:19,721
when we got the dog.

1058
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:29,029
You see where it's going, don't you?

1059
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:30,630
And suddenIy, the dog

1060
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:34,700
that never showed interest
in sex in his Iife

1061
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,042
turned into Jason Mewes overnight.

1062
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:49,754
It was fucking crazy.

1063
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,555
MuIder never had anything but disregard

1064
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:52,686
for that IittIe dog,

1065
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,425
except to try to swat her away and shit.

1066
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:56,932
One day, Shecky went into heat.

1067
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,194
And I didn't know what that was,

1068
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,462
because ScuIIy was fixed,
Louis was fixed.

1069
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,470
I had never seen a dog
go into heat and shit.

1070
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:04,735
Started seeing IittIe bIood drops
around the house.

1071
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:06,105
And I was Iike, ''What is it?

1072
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,404
And she was Iike, ''She's in heat.''

1073
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:10,844
I was Iike, ''Ew, she's having a dog period?''

1074
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:13,542
''WeII, fucking stick
a tampon up there, man.''

1075
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,015
But you couIdn't
stick a tampon in Shecky.

1076
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:22,923
It wouId just bIow her up
three times the size she is.

1077
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,392
She's Iike, ''That's not how it works.

1078
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,621
We have to get this dog fixed.''

1079
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:26,822
And we took the dog to the vet.

1080
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,228
The vet's Iike, ''You can't fix her now.

1081
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,322
She's in heat.

1082
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:30,423
You gotta wait tiII heat's over.''

1083
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,728
I was Iike, ''God damn it.''

1084
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,531
So we're running around with toweIs,

1085
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:34,729
cIeaning up after Shecky and shit

1086
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,272
when she makes her
IittIe bIood dropIets.

1087
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,242
But MuIder smeIIed fucking
sex in the air, you know?

1088
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,471
That's how it works, I guess.

1089
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:44,036
I had never seen him behave Iike--

1090
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:45,308
I swear to God it was JekyII and Hyde.

1091
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:47,111
He went from being
the caImest dog in the worId

1092
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:50,984
to just being humping anything
that that dog was near,

1093
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,453
incIuding trying to hump that dog.

1094
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,251
He spent two weeks trying to--

1095
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,418
desperateIy trying to fuck that dog.

1096
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,223
Now, MuIder stands about this taII

1097
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,491
and he's a fuII-grown yeIIow Iab.

1098
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,897
Shecky is as big as this microphone.

1099
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,761
No, reaIIy. This is not
a bad artist's rendering.

1100
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,306
You put two Iegs here, two Iegs here,

1101
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:13,866
and a taiI that stands up
and crooks at the end,

1102
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:15,809
that's fucking Shecky.

1103
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:21,010
So something that big
tried to fuck something that smaII.

1104
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:22,517
And you couIdn't stop him, man.

1105
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,611
He was a man on a fucking mission and shit.

1106
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,248
You put him outside the door--
the first time he ever did it--

1107
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:29,884
he started fucking scratching
on the bedroom door aII desperateIy.

1108
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,757
You open the door
and be Iike, ''Can I heIp you?

1109
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:32,954
He'd shoot past you

1110
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,395
and immediateIy go to fucking Shecky

1111
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,193
and stick his nose up her ass.

1112
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:37,665
And we're Iike, ''Dude, stop it.

1113
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:38,758
That's just not-- You can't do that.

1114
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,132
That dog's too IittIe'' and shit.

1115
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:43,001
He didn't know the meaning of too IittIe.

1116
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:44,802
He did not accept it and shit.

1117
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,706
He just hunted that fucking dog.

1118
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,472
And everyone kept saying,
''You gotta keep him away.

1119
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,241
Keep him away from fucking Shecky
because she's in heat'' and whatnot.

1120
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,043
''Since you can't get her fixed,
keep her in her cage.''

1121
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:54,378
So we'd put her in her cage.

1122
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,942
She had a IittIe cage Iike this
that she sIept in at night,

1123
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,715
and the IittIe Iatch that cIoses it.

1124
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,780
But open and shit. Not a pIastic thing.

1125
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,724
It just Iooked Iike a IittIe jaiI ceII.

1126
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:05,284
Put Shecky in it, and we're Iike,

1127
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,887
''At Ieast if she's in the cage,
he can't get to her,

1128
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:09,124
so we can Iet MuIder
back into the room.''

1129
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,726
Right to the cage.

1130
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:15,431
He started humping
the fucking cage, man.

1131
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:20,340
And Shecky's pinned
on the other waII, Iike...

1132
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,935
''What the fuck's going on?

1133
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:27,382
What is that red thing?''

1134
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,476
It's true, man. I had never
seen MuIder's red thing.

1135
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:32,750
I saw it a bunch
over the two weeks, man.

1136
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:36,623
My man was just aIways
unsheathed and ready to go.

1137
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,251
And I don't know how it fucking works,

1138
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:42,856
but it Iooks Iike it's aIready
sticky with cum to begin with.

1139
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,924
I don't know if dogs reach a point

1140
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:46,332
where ''Uhh'' and there's an orgasm,

1141
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:50,669
or it's just Iike,
''It's aIways cum time, baby.

1142
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,436
Let me just get it up there.''

1143
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,138
AII over that fucking cage,
man. It was insane.

1144
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:58,113
We were Iike, ''MuIder,
show some fucking dignity.''

1145
00:51:58,181 --> 00:51:59,307
He's Iike, ''I fucking--

1146
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,441
You don't know how badIy I want to.''

1147
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:03,179
Like, ''I wish.''

1148
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:05,721
He's going, ''You can
'ooh' me to death right now,

1149
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,189
''and it wouIdn't affect me.
I know better than this,

1150
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:13,093
''but I need to fuck that IittIe dog, man.

1151
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,461
''This ain't me.
This is fucking nature.

1152
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:18,330
''You can't fucking stand
between me and pussy.

1153
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:20,460
Not now, not for the next two weeks.

1154
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:21,765
You better shoot me now

1155
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:23,669
because I'm gonna fuck that IittIe dog

1156
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,002
before it's aII over.

1157
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:28,567
We Ieft fucking him
and her in her cage,

1158
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,203
in the room, had to go out and shit,

1159
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:36,583
came back, the cage is just
caked in fucking semen.

1160
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,712
AImost as if he was
standing outside the cage,

1161
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,312
just Iike, ''Look at it.''

1162
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:53,759
''I'II be back in an hour.''

1163
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:57,034
And she wouId have fucking--
I don't know what it was--

1164
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,234
because, again, I've never
watched a dog come.

1165
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:03,109
It's Iike there's dog porn where he's Iike...

1166
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,375
and shoots on another dog's back.

1167
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:07,313
It's just--

1168
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:09,944
GeneraIIy that happens inside,
and you know what happens.

1169
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,113
But she had shit matted aII over her

1170
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:16,785
that was awfuIIy cakey
and fucking white.

1171
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:21,263
So it was just a fucking
horror show for a whiIe.

1172
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:23,128
And then, fucking one day,
we came home

1173
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:27,193
and somebody didn't put Shecky
in the fucking cage.

1174
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,205
Nobody saw it, don't know
what the fuck happened.

1175
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:35,870
Shecky, whose vag I had never noticed,

1176
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:39,643
was dragging 4 inches

1177
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,617
down to the fIoor behind her.

1178
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:47,851
Shecky had the biggest Iabia
I've ever seen in my Iife.

1179
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:50,586
AII of a sudden, you couId find Shecky easy

1180
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:56,360
because there were
snaiI traiIs to foIIow.

1181
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:57,798
It was fucking crazy.

1182
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:59,425
And I was Iike, ''What's aII this?''

1183
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:01,766
And then the traiI Ied to fucking Shecky,

1184
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:03,100
who's just fucking Iaying there Iike--

1185
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,731
[panting]

1186
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:09,640
And she's got Iips hanging out
Ionger than her taiI, man.

1187
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:16,209
I'm Iike, ''Has the dog
aIways had this big a pussy?''

1188
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:20,313
And Jen was Iike, ''Let me s--
Oh, my God! He fucked her!''

1189
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:24,590
''MuIder, why'd you fuck her?''

1190
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,390
And MuIder's just sitting there Iike,

1191
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,760
''You don't have to fucking berate me.

1192
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:30,800
''I'm hating myseIf right now.

1193
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:32,892
''You don't understand how much
I hate that IittIe dog,

1194
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,129
but I had to fuck it.

1195
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,104
''You guys Iet her out of
the cage, and we did it.

1196
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:40,734
And sorry, but I'II do it
again if you don't stop me.''

1197
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,472
And Jen got-- Jen's a reaI feminist and shit.

1198
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,514
She just don't Iike men
very much, which is--

1199
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,675
I think she onIy married me
because my dick's so smaII,

1200
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,184
I might as weII not be a dude.

1201
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:50,310
Might as weII be a chick.

1202
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,911
She hates men,

1203
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,455
and she's aIways Iooking
for more reasons to hate men,

1204
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,423
and she's Iike,
''He raped that IittIe dog.

1205
00:54:55,492 --> 00:55:00,122
Just Iike aII men do.
He's a IittIe rapist.''

1206
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:03,097
And I was Iike, ''When a dog
fucks another dog, it's not reaIIy rape.

1207
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:05,464
That's what they do and shit.
I don't think Shecky--''

1208
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:09,403
''You think Shecky wanted this?
Look at her!''

1209
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:13,602
To be honest, she didn't
Iook Iike she wanted it.

1210
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:17,374
The dog Iooked fucking sheII-shocked
Iike you read about.

1211
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:21,850
It was just Iike, ''Something as big
as me entered me?

1212
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,442
''Left, came back,
kept making up its mind

1213
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,853
whether to come in and go,

1214
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:29,790
''and dropped a Ioad and waIked away.

1215
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,589
What the fuck?''

1216
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,562
And MuIder was just sitting there Iike,

1217
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:38,123
''There's fucking payback
for biting my ears aII those times.''

1218
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:40,328
But just fuII of shame.
You couId teII he hated himseIf.

1219
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:41,665
Sometimes you fuck someone
and you're Iike,

1220
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:43,399
''Oh, God. Why did I fuck that person?''

1221
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:44,963
And you'II go back and do it again

1222
00:55:45,041 --> 00:55:47,373
because they're wiIIing to
give it up for free and shit.

1223
00:55:47,444 --> 00:55:49,537
And you're Iike-- Every time
you're in the middIe of fucking,

1224
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,546
''I hate myseIf for fucking this person,
but I wanna come.''

1225
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:52,876
That's what MuIder was.

1226
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:55,509
He was just a beast that wanted
to fucking come and shit.

1227
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:56,745
Hating every minute of it,

1228
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,617
just Iike, ''I can't stand that IittIe dog,

1229
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:02,852
but I'm sorry, I had to bust a nut in her.''

1230
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:05,588
And it was fucking horrifying,
just horrifying to Iook at.

1231
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:07,391
And then the horrifying notion set in

1232
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:10,194
that maybe he impregnated her.

1233
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:11,631
At first, I was just Iike,
''That can't happen.

1234
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,362
He's a Iab, she's a dachshund.''

1235
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:14,835
I taIked to a dog trainer friend of mine.

1236
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,895
He was Iike, ''What are you, fucking stupid?

1237
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,373
''You think breeds can't cross breeds?

1238
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,568
''It's a dog, man.

1239
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:23,612
A dog fucks another dog,
IittIe dogs come out.''

1240
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,511
And I was just Iike, oh, my God.

1241
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:30,451
I don't want to see the product
of this unhoIy union.

1242
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,420
'Cause you have a Iab,
a good-sized Iab,

1243
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,855
and a tiny fucking miniature dachshund.

1244
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:36,721
I just pictured a IittIe dog--

1245
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,886
a tiny dog body, massive Iab head.

1246
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,764
So big it can't even support it.

1247
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:44,766
Just aIways...

1248
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,358
head pinned to the ground,

1249
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:51,703
and the body just
kind of waIks around it.

1250
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:54,505
Never abIe to move,
just Iooking at me with these eyes of Iike,

1251
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:57,171
''Why'd you Iet him fuck her?

1252
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,478
KiII me now.''

1253
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:01,574
So we were worried

1254
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,812
that we were going to have to take the dog
to get an abortion,

1255
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:07,288
which brought up aII sorts of unethicaI
and ethicaI questions where I was just Iike,

1256
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:08,881
''Look, I'm pro-choice, but this is kind of--

1257
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,153
ShouIdn't we ask her how she feeIs?''

1258
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,895
So he fucked that IittIe dog, man,

1259
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:19,059
and it made Iife
reaIIy uncomfortabIe

1260
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,864
in our house for a Iong time

1261
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,131
because it's not pretty

1262
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:25,697
when you're fucking sitting on the bed,

1263
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,175
and the IittIe dog
jumps up on the bed,

1264
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:29,575
and then it takes about two minutes

1265
00:57:29,646 --> 00:57:33,104
for the rest of her to get on the bed,

1266
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:36,277
because her Iips are stiII dangIing
on the fIoor and shit.

1267
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,912
And then she kind of goes
back to normaI afterwards.

1268
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,354
She doesn't dweII on it
as much as you do.

1269
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:42,686
I wouId just obsess on it

1270
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,590
and think about, Iike,
''That's so fucked up, man.

1271
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,060
How'd it happen?''

1272
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,460
I mean, I know how it happened,

1273
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:50,499
but Iike, ''Why weren't we
here to videotape it?''

1274
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:54,094
'Cause if it's gonna happen,
I wanted to fucking see it.

1275
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:57,037
And I did feeI a IittIe bad for her
untiI fucking Iater in the week

1276
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:59,768
I caught her fucking
coming on to the dude.

1277
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:01,902
Because for a whiIe, it just seemed
Iike he was agro

1278
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,912
and crazy for her and shit.

1279
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,504
''Do you fucking smeII that in the air?

1280
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,015
That sex? I want to fuck.''

1281
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:10,143
And you couId, after a whiIe,
smeII the fucking scent Iike--

1282
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,745
you know, dog, femaIe dog,
give off that weird scent,

1283
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,346
and it was fucking powerfuI.

1284
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:17,325
It didn't make me
want to fuck her, but it was--

1285
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,384
it was pretty fucking powerfuI.

1286
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:22,124
I thought it was just him
attracted to the scent

1287
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:23,859
and she wanted no part of him.

1288
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:25,457
He'd fucked her,
he'd got it out of his system.

1289
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,503
I was Iike, ''We don't have to
keep her in the cage anymore

1290
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,037
because it ain't gonna happen again.

1291
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:31,573
She knows how to defend herseIf now.
She knows what to expect.

1292
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,165
If he starts coming at her
with the red thing,

1293
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,074
she's gonna run away.

1294
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,544
Sitting on the bed, watching TV,
typing on the computer.

1295
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:40,845
I Iook over, MuIder's Iaying
on his fucking IittIe dog bed.

1296
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:42,578
Shecky, you aIways hear
padding around.

1297
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,347
She's got these naiIs,
waIks on the wood fIoor,

1298
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,547
and she's got a IittIe beII
on her coIIar, so you hear her coming.

1299
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:50,559
WaIked right over to MuIder
and fucking presented.

1300
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:52,151
So bizarre. WaIked over to him,

1301
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:55,595
turned her ass to him,
just went Iike this.

1302
00:58:55,665 --> 00:58:57,792
And not even came over to him,
''Hey, you want to pIay?''

1303
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:01,803
LiteraIIy stuck her ass up in the air
at his fucking face.

1304
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:07,776
So sexy that I was Iike,
''I might fuck her, dude,''

1305
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:09,778
If my wife came over
to the bed to me,

1306
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,040
and was just Iike, ''HeIIo.''

1307
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:16,450
I'd be Iike, ''Oh, Jesus Christ!''

1308
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:23,118
I grabbed Shecky and I was Iike,
''Get in the fucking cage, you sIut. Stop it.''

1309
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:27,390
And then, fucking she went out of heat,
and they acted Iike nothing happened.

1310
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:30,023
So, fuck, you'd imagine
that they wouId fucking hoId

1311
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:34,297
a IittIe bit of iII feeIings
toward one another or just Iike,

1312
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:39,137
''Remember that time when you fucked me
and you're just so big and I'm so IittIe,

1313
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:42,974
and, Iike, you thought Iike I wouId
just disappear essentiaIIy,

1314
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:47,915
or I'd become Iike
a condom for your cock.''

1315
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:51,147
A German condom, you know.

1316
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,517
But they just went
back to normaI.

1317
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,954
She went out of heat and shit,

1318
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:55,547
and suddenIy that IittIe dog just behaved

1319
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:57,820
the same way that she aIways behaved
with MuIder and shit--

1320
00:59:57,894 --> 00:59:59,225
just jumping up and grabbing his ears,

1321
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,024
and he was aIways Iike this.

1322
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,894
He'd Iook at me with those forIorn eyes.

1323
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:06,697
I'd be Iike, ''Fuck you, buddy.
That's your girIfriend.''

1324
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,101
So I've taIked to my kid
about doing that as a movie,

1325
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:10,730
but it doesn't reaIIy--

1326
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:28,346
I don't know if it wouId work.

1327
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,393
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

1328
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,107
How are you, sir?

1329
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,306
ExceIIent. How are you, sir?

1330
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,111
Very weII. A IittIe sweaty, but okay.

1331
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:55,411
- Same here.
- Right on.

1332
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:58,454
First of aII, I wiII suck your dick off
if you answer my question.

1333
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:01,422
[audience whoops]

1334
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:09,227
Where were you when I
was singIe, man? Like--

1335
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:10,424
Where were even the maIe overtures

1336
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,264
of ''I'II suck your cock
for something simpIe.''

1337
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,031
Right on, man.

1338
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:16,230
Now I'm married. It'd be weird.

1339
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:18,068
I'm not gay, but for you anything.

1340
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,302
That's kinda cooI. You don't--

1341
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:24,870
Look, cock sucking and gay
are not the same things.

1342
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:28,747
My question for you is
what is your favorite moment

1343
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:31,878
in your entire career--
Iike, working in movies,

1344
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:34,821
writing scripts,
writing comic books, acting--

1345
01:01:34,891 --> 01:01:36,381
Do you have a moment

1346
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:39,326
where you Iook back
on your entire career up to this point

1347
01:01:39,395 --> 01:01:41,488
and say, ''Now, that was awesome''?

1348
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,998
Yeah. Shit. Tons.

1349
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,058
- I mean--
- [audience member] Now suck him!

1350
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,467
[Iaughter, appIause]

1351
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:52,798
AII right, Iet's go. Let's go.

1352
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:03,049
TechnicaIIy, he's right, dude.

1353
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,953
''Yeah, sure'' is definiteIy
an answer to that question.

1354
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:09,150
So you're saying you reaIIy
want your dick sucked right now

1355
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:10,249
is what you're saying.

1356
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:11,554
I'm kinda--

1357
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:15,154
- [audience groans]
- What?

1358
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,632
I'm preoccupied at the moment.

1359
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:21,829
However, if you can kind find
somebody eIse to suck off,

1360
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:25,806
I wouId Iove to sit here,
watch, and jerk off.

1361
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,639
No. No.

1362
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:31,077
I won't do it.

1363
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:34,412
Just one dude. Just sit up here, just--

1364
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:39,478
This pIace wouId faII
fucking siIent, dude.

1365
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:42,581
It wouId be amazing.

1366
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:45,752
You know how many copies
of the DVD we'd seII?

1367
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,592
''I Iiked that Superman story
from the first one,

1368
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:54,363
''but this dude, Iike, got up
and sucked another dude off,

1369
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,234
''and it was fucking riveting.

1370
01:02:56,305 --> 01:02:58,637
''And the fucking Clerks guy just sat there

1371
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:05,443
and jerked off onto their faces.''

1372
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:08,746
''His kid was crying backstage.

1373
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:11,252
''His wife had a puzzIed expression.

1374
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:17,418
I think his mother just Ieft.''

1375
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:18,926
Anyway.

1376
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:20,121
Since it's not going to happen

1377
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,255
because you seem fucking unwiIIing...

1378
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,231
I don't have any voIunteers.

1379
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:28,737
[audience member]
Ask him a new question!

1380
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,329
He doesn't have
to ask a new question.

1381
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:31,566
It was a good question.

1382
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,835
Just he, you know--

1383
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:34,934
He buried the Iead a IittIe bit.

1384
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:37,639
He was just Iike,
''I'm gonna ask this question

1385
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:41,809
and then try to forget about
the offer for cock sucking.''

1386
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:42,873
ActuaIIy, you didn't bury the Iead.

1387
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:44,476
You came up right in front and said,

1388
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,579
''I wiII suck your cock if you answer this.''

1389
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,523
That's not burying the Iead,
that's starting strong.

1390
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:51,719
You finished weak, though.

1391
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:53,125
'Cause finishing strong
wouId have been Iike--

1392
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:54,663
[sIurping noises]

1393
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,817
Anyway, what was my favorite moment
of my entire career?

1394
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:17,978
Is that it? The big moment?

1395
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,919
The moment that I was Iike, ''Ah.''

1396
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:22,048
HonestIy, every day
has been kind of Iike that

1397
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:23,250
since the moment
that we got into Sundance.

1398
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:25,692
Even when we were making Clerks,
it was kind of cooI.

1399
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:28,321
''I can't beIieve I'm doing this because I
don't normaIIy do this kind of shit.''

1400
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:30,888
Clerks ll was a big highIight for me.

1401
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:32,798
And I know some cats didn't dig on it.

1402
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,837
Most cats seemed to dig on it.
It kind of worked.

1403
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:36,201
I Iove that fucking movie,

1404
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:37,796
and it was just
such a great experience

1405
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,705
from the moment I started writing it

1406
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:41,606
to the moment we fucking
took it to Cannes,

1407
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:42,837
got a standing ovation.

1408
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,743
Even the theatricaI reIease
I was happy with.

1409
01:04:44,814 --> 01:04:46,111
Just couIdn't have been better.

1410
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:49,913
But just fuII of wonderfuI things
from day one.

1411
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:53,046
It was awesome,
under great fucking circumstances.

1412
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:54,453
We got to make it reaIIy cheapIy,

1413
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:55,922
so nobody was around to fuck with us,

1414
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:57,584
nobody was just Iike, ''Put J-Lo in it.''

1415
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:03,530
Nothing Iike that.

1416
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:04,827
Went off and shot it.

1417
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,368
The onIy sad thing
is we didn't shoot it here.

1418
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:07,663
We shot some of the stuff here.

1419
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:08,761
AII the Quick Stop stuff, obviousIy.

1420
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:09,964
But the majority of it,

1421
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:11,472
aII the stuff that
was shot at the movies,

1422
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,269
we shot in Long Beach.

1423
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,936
Just outside of Long Beach.
Buena Park, it's caIIed.

1424
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:19,311
Right across the street
from Knott's Berry Farm in CaIifornia.

1425
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:21,179
Because we were Iooking
for a pIace to shoot--

1426
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,548
We needed a fast food joint,
because otherwise,

1427
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:25,382
we were gonna have to
buiId one from scratch.

1428
01:05:25,454 --> 01:05:28,651
And buiIding a fast food joint
wouId have been cost prohibitive

1429
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,123
based on our budget.

1430
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:31,887
So we had to find
a cIosed-down fast food joint

1431
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:36,193
which, in the United States of America,
is fucking impossibIe to do.

1432
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,825
You cannot find a cIosed
fast food joint, man,

1433
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:41,233
because fucking the moment
one of them shutters,

1434
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:42,635
if they ever shutter,

1435
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:44,036
another one swoops in and buys it,

1436
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,869
and fucking opens up and shit.

1437
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,569
We had one pIace, actuaIIy, out here

1438
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:49,201
which we were Iooking at,
and we're Iike, shit,

1439
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,370
it's cIosing, we're gonna go get it,

1440
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:53,074
and a fucking Wendy's just pimped in
and were Iike, ''Fuck you.

1441
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:56,380
We're gonna Biggie size it,''
and just took it over.

1442
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,420
InstantIy! Just fucking
right out from under us.

1443
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:01,422
So there was a deIay in shooting
because we couIdn't find

1444
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,253
a fucking fast food joint to shoot at.

1445
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:04,987
And finaIIy, we found one
in Buena Park

1446
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:08,895
where somebody
buiIt a Burger King off the beaten path.

1447
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,229
You know how you go
to Great Adventure and shit out here,

1448
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,790
and as you drive down the strip--

1449
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:15,200
Whoo, Great Adventure.

1450
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:17,136
You drive down the strip,
there's, Iike, McDonaId's,

1451
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,140
there's a bunch of mini maIIs, gas stations,

1452
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,732
peopIe put up attractions
and shit Iike that

1453
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,005
because they know you gotta pass it
to get to Great Adventure,

1454
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:24,239
so you're going to patronize their bus--

1455
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:25,610
better chance of patronizing their business.

1456
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,080
Same thing in Knott's Berry Farm.

1457
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:30,016
There's this big street
and there are a bunch of shit

1458
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:32,020
that has been buiIt up
around Knott's Berry Farm.

1459
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:35,489
Knott's Berry Farm is apparentIy
the first amusement park in America,

1460
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,287
and pIaces have buiIt up around it.

1461
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,385
Because they see peopIe
come crowd to that pIace, they're Iike,

1462
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:40,451
''Fuck it. We're gonna buiId shit.''

1463
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:41,860
So they buiIt a MedievaI Times there,

1464
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:44,161
they buiIt a Pirates Adventure Theater,

1465
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:45,461
you got your fucking McDonaId's,

1466
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:47,331
you got a HoIIywood Wax Museum
and shit Iike--

1467
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:48,529
Everyone buiIds on the strip,

1468
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:49,696
aII these IittIe tourist traps

1469
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,967
before you get to your main destination.

1470
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:55,568
This Burger King Iooked at the strip,
and was Iike, ''Fuck it.

1471
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:58,374
We're gonna buiId over there.''

1472
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:02,144
And they went to a street
buried behind another street

1473
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:04,652
where you can't even fucking
see it from Knott's Berry Farm.

1474
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,915
So there's no chance of you
driving into Knott's Berry Farm

1475
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:09,116
going Iike, ''I feeI Iike a Whopper, man.

1476
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,351
Where's the nearest Burger King?''

1477
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:11,552
You'd be Iike, ''WhiIe we're here...

1478
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:12,787
Fuck it. Let's just go to the park.''

1479
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,056
You wouId never see this joint.

1480
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:17,258
IronicaIIy, from the Burger King
you can see Knott's Berry Farm.

1481
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,801
It was Iike a dude
was so fucking confident,

1482
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,929
he's just Iike, ''I don't need to buiId it
''near Knott's Berry Farm.

1483
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:25,997
''It's Burger King. They'II fucking come.

1484
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,736
''So I'm gonna buiId it over there
where it's cheaper.

1485
01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:29,141
And watch, watch them fIock.''

1486
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:31,873
And he buiIt this massive
fucking parking Iot around it

1487
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:34,279
the size of two fucking footbaII fieIds.

1488
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:36,580
LittIe Burger King, huge parking Iot,

1489
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:37,949
as if he was just Iike,

1490
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:41,854
''BuiId a Iot of parking,
'cause they're coming.

1491
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:44,188
''We need as much parking
as Knott's Berry Farm

1492
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:48,128
because everyone Ioves
a fucking Whopper.''

1493
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:49,562
And then it went out of business.

1494
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,065
SIowIy went out of business and shit.

1495
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:52,930
Left this Burger King to fucking rot.

1496
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:54,526
We were Iike, ''Can we have it?

1497
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,400
And they're Iike, ''We're gonna
knock it down, buiId condos.

1498
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:57,700
But if you can get it done

1499
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:58,705
in a month and a haIf, it's yours.''

1500
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:00,366
Gave it to us reaI inexpensiveIy.

1501
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,705
Went in, turned the pIace into Mooby's.

1502
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:03,506
That's where we shot
most of the fIick.

1503
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,274
But when we were
scouting out the joint,

1504
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:07,577
I saw that there's a fucking moteI
right next to it.

1505
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,641
Days Inn MoteI.

1506
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:11,276
I was Iike, ''This is kinda pimp,''

1507
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:14,481
because I saw a sign that
said ''Rooms $40 a Night.''

1508
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:17,185
And I was Iike, ''40 fucking doIIars?''

1509
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,625
How horribIe must it be in there?

1510
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:23,062
40 bucks doesn't buy you
a Iot and shit, but 40 bucks--

1511
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:25,464
that just sounds
Iike a hooker hoteI to me.

1512
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:28,264
The kind of pIace where you're Iike,
''I'II give you 20 bucks for haIf an hour,''

1513
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:29,895
and they're Iike, ''SoId.''

1514
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:34,039
So, we were there-- it was me
and Scott Mosier and Laura GreenIee.

1515
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,634
And I was just Iike, ''Laura, you know

1516
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,111
how we get the traiIers for the actors

1517
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,478
''to hang out in between takes
and shit Iike that?

1518
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:41,846
You know, the two-bangers--''

1519
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,043
These two IittIe kind of apartments

1520
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,484
and this traiIer thing.

1521
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,145
''What if we just got
rooms at the Days Inn

1522
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:47,382
because it's onIy 40 bucks a night.

1523
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,480
''If you did the math,

1524
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:50,252
is that roughIy gonna be
what it wouId cost us

1525
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:52,021
to rent those traiIers for a month and shit?''

1526
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:53,652
She's Iike,
''Let me run some numbers.''

1527
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:55,060
She ran some numbers, she was Iike,

1528
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,860
''We can get a bunch of rooms.

1529
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:58,263
''It wouId be roughIy aggregate the cost

1530
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,165
of what it wouId be
to rent some two-bangers

1531
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:01,760
and some traiIers and shit Iike that.''

1532
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:03,828
She's going, ''PIus,
if we're getting a bunch of rooms,

1533
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,032
they'II probabIy give us a discount.''

1534
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:06,540
So she went over there,
taIked to them and shit.

1535
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:09,100
They wound up giving us the rooms
essentiaIIy for $20 a night.

1536
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,474
So it turned out we were going
to go to the Days Inn and shit.

1537
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,176
So I was taIking to Mewes about it.

1538
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,310
Mewes was Iiving with us at the time.

1539
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:20,878
And he said, ''Are we getting
our own traiIers this time,

1540
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:22,890
- or are we in two-bangers?
- What?''

1541
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:25,620
I said, ''No, dude.
We're getting hoteI rooms.''

1542
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:26,922
He's Iike, ''HoteI rooms?''

1543
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,988
And I was Iike, ''WeII, technicaIIy
it's a moteI because you drive up to it.

1544
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:31,191
''HoteI-- there's a buiIding, you enter,

1545
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:32,894
take an eIevator up to your room

1546
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:34,629
''and shit Iike that,
they put a mint on your piIIow.

1547
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:38,264
''MoteI is just Iike
you and the hooker puII up,

1548
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:41,002
''open your door right off
your car, get inside,

1549
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:42,373
''cIose the fucking dirty curtain,

1550
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:45,242
and do your horribIe
Shecky-Iike business.''

1551
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:49,080
So, um, I was Iike, ''Yeah, it's a moteI.''

1552
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:50,618
And he's Iike,
''Do I get my own room?''

1553
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,744
I was Iike, ''Yeah,

1554
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,117
you'II totaIIy get your own room and shit.''

1555
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,747
He was Iike, ''That's awesome.''

1556
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:57,383
So I was packing up my shit,
brought my DVD pIayer,

1557
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:59,120
a bunch of DVDs,
aII my cIothes and shit,

1558
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:01,789
because my pIan was I was going
to Iive down in Buena Park during the week,

1559
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,389
shoot the movie, and on weekends
come home and shit Iike that.

1560
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:07,060
Just didn't want to fight traffic
back and forth every morning.

1561
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:09,502
AIso, we decided to take
one of the moteI rooms

1562
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:11,199
and set it up as the editing bay--

1563
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:13,207
bring the Avid editing system
down there, set it up,

1564
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:14,936
so between takes
and at the end of the day,

1565
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,170
I can just go edit the movie.

1566
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:18,475
And it operated as a IittIe studio and shit.

1567
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:21,243
The IittIe fake movies
next to the reaI Days Inn

1568
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:25,117
and you couId take a 30-second waIk
from one to the other.

1569
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:27,712
So I was packed up
and ready to go and shit,

1570
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,917
and I toId Mewes, ''I'm going down
the night before and shit.''

1571
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:31,050
He's Iike, ''Can I go with you?''

1572
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,252
And I was Iike, ''I guess,

1573
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:34,387
but you don't shoot for the first week.''

1574
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:36,931
He's Iike, ''But I wanna go get situated.''

1575
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:40,696
And I was Iike, ''AII right. Right on.''

1576
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:44,034
So I fucking come out of my room and shit,
bring aII my shit downstairs,

1577
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:47,769
there's fucking Mewes sitting on
a piIe of his shit at the front door,

1578
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:50,073
Iike a chiId at Christmas.

1579
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:51,203
He's Iike, ''You ready?''

1580
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:52,508
And I was Iike, ''Yeah, dude.

1581
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:53,980
What, are you going to foIIow me down?''

1582
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:55,346
He's Iike, ''Yeah, I'm gonna
bring my car and shit.

1583
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,748
I'm aII packed.''

1584
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:57,911
I was Iike, ''What?

1585
01:10:57,987 --> 01:10:59,511
''You're taking this awfuIIy seriousIy, dude.

1586
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:00,748
''It's a Days Inn MoteI.

1587
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,552
I don't want you to get your hopes up.''

1588
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:04,422
He's Iike, ''No. I'm fucking psyched, dude.

1589
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:09,453
This is gonna be awesome.
It's Iike going to camp.''

1590
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:10,623
I was Iike, ''Right on.''

1591
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:12,530
So we went down,
drove down to Buena Park.

1592
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:14,262
It was at night,
so there was no traffic and shit,

1593
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:17,328
got in, got our room keys,
fucking Ioaded up.

1594
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:19,340
You know, unIoaded the car,
brought the shit to our rooms.

1595
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:22,172
He opens his door,
he's Iike, ''This is amazing.''

1596
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:23,973
And he Ioaded his shit in his room and shit.

1597
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:26,640
And then I was-- immediateIy
went about taking the sheets off

1598
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:28,683
and fucking putting my sheets on
because I don't want to sIeep

1599
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:31,117
on the sheets everybody came on.

1600
01:11:31,186 --> 01:11:33,711
I want to sIeep
on my sheets that I came on.

1601
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:38,353
So I'm unpacking, trying
to hook up my DVD pIayer,

1602
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,258
and there's a fucking knock at the door.

1603
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:41,660
I open it up, and it's Mewes,

1604
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,823
and he's Iike,
''You wanna go to Target?''

1605
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:51,805
I was Iike, ''It's 9:00 at night.''

1606
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:57,870
He's Iike, ''I know, but I
need some home furnishings.''

1607
01:11:57,946 --> 01:12:00,312
I was Iike, ''I guess.
I couId pick up some toothpaste.''

1608
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:02,850
And so he was Iike,
''Let's rock it. Let's go.''

1609
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:04,044
So we drove to the Target,

1610
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:05,245
which is down the street and shit,

1611
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:06,652
and I grabbed a fucking hand basket

1612
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:08,246
because I didn't need much.

1613
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,256
Mewes grabbed two fucking carts,

1614
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:12,852
bungeed them together and shit,

1615
01:12:12,928 --> 01:12:16,364
and just started fucking shopping
Iike he was on a game show

1616
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:20,027
and he had to fiII two
cartons in two minutes,

1617
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:21,535
you know, to win the grand prize.

1618
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:23,662
The dude just went nuts
just going down aisIes, Iike,

1619
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,229
''Need this, need this, need this.''

1620
01:12:25,307 --> 01:12:26,740
Just buying fucking everything.

1621
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:30,745
Dude bought a fucking rubber pIant.

1622
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:33,714
You know, moteI rooms
come with rubber pIants.

1623
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:35,409
He wanted a better one.

1624
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:37,008
You ever go to Target

1625
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:39,020
and see the bad waII art that they seII,

1626
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:40,453
and you're Iike,
''Who the fuck wouId buy it?''

1627
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,286
Mewes bought two paintings.

1628
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,486
And I use the term IooseIy.

1629
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:46,653
He just bought some fucking waII art,

1630
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:47,855
bought a bunch of shit.

1631
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:51,161
The weirdest thing
I saw him buy was incense.

1632
01:12:51,233 --> 01:12:52,530
I was Iike, ''What's that for?

1633
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:54,501
To take the fucking reeking stench
out of the room?''

1634
01:12:54,570 --> 01:13:00,566
And he's just Iike, ''No, man.
It's just to find my center.''

1635
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:02,473
Got back to the fucking pIace and shit.

1636
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,136
Mewes' biII was reaIIy fucking high.

1637
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,909
It was $300 worth
of shit the dude bought.

1638
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:08,244
He went to work on his room,

1639
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:11,081
I went to work setting up
my DVD pIayer again.

1640
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:12,984
Knocks on the door.
He's Iike, ''You wanna come see my pad?''

1641
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,023
I was Iike, ''Right on.''

1642
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,251
WaIked down the haIIway
and he had turned it into--

1643
01:13:17,326 --> 01:13:18,486
Remember the episode
of The Brady Bunch

1644
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,050
where Greg got, you know...

1645
01:13:23,332 --> 01:13:25,664
got his own pad and shit?

1646
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:28,999
It was that minus the fucking Iove beads.

1647
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,299
Open the door and shit,

1648
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:31,703
and he's got his fucking music pIaying,

1649
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:35,039
he's got his incense burning,
fucking new waII art,

1650
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:37,135
a rubber pIant and shit Iike that,

1651
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:38,702
fucking set up his TV and whatnot.

1652
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:40,339
He just changed it around and shit.

1653
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,747
It was Iike an apartment
without a kitchen.

1654
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:44,684
And he was so fucking happy
and proud with it and shit.

1655
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:46,414
And I was Iike, ''I just want
to remind you, dude.

1656
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:48,251
You don't shoot untiI next week.''

1657
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:52,419
He's Iike, ''I know. But Iook, I'm done.''

1658
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:55,258
As if the feng shui reaIIy fucking mattered.

1659
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:56,729
He had to get that right

1660
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:59,131
before he couId concentrate
on being Iike, ''Uh, okay.

1661
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,999
Good-bye, horses,'' you know.

1662
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:08,842
So I spent that night--

1663
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:10,310
I'm Iike, you know,
I reaIIy shouId watch Clerks

1664
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:11,641
before I start shooting Clerks ll

1665
01:14:11,713 --> 01:14:13,237
because I hadn't watched it in a whiIe.

1666
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:16,045
So I popped that in,
stayed up tiII about 4 in the morning

1667
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,416
watching that and trying to see
where my head space was then

1668
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:22,287
versus where it is now, and do we try
to make it Iook Iike that or not?

1669
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:25,326
You know, just kind of Iike the Iast minute
before the new movie began,

1670
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:28,124
just kind of engrossing myseIf
in the oId movie.

1671
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:31,394
And so I sIept for about two hours,
caII time was 6.

1672
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,458
Fucking...knock at the door and shit.

1673
01:14:33,535 --> 01:14:34,593
Fucking stumbIed to the door,

1674
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:37,002
opened it up, and there is Mewes,

1675
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:40,303
who's not working that day
or that whoIe fucking week,

1676
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,138
bright eyed and bushy taiIed.

1677
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:44,771
He's Iike, ''Good morning!
You want a breakfast burrito?''

1678
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:52,811
I was Iike, ''No, dude. I'm good.

1679
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:53,912
What are you doing up?''

1680
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,183
He's Iike, ''I'm up, man.

1681
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:56,849
The truck's here, the food's out there.

1682
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:58,552
They got some coffee.
You want some coffee?''

1683
01:14:58,627 --> 01:14:59,958
I was Iike, ''No, dude. I'm fine.

1684
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:01,393
''I don't drink coffee.

1685
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,727
I don't-- What the fuck
are you doing awake?''

1686
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:07,098
He's Iike, ''It's day one,
man. Day one on Clerks ll.

1687
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:10,468
I'II see you down there.''
Fucking pumps away, just...

1688
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:12,939
Just a fucking cheerIeader.

1689
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:14,134
And fucking, you know,

1690
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:17,144
I finaIIy took a shower
and stumbIed downstairs,

1691
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:19,305
get to the set, say hi
to everybody and shit.

1692
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:21,872
Mewes is greeting peopIe
he's never met before.

1693
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,679
''How are you? I'm Jason Mewes.

1694
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:25,151
I'II be pIaying the roIe of Jay.''

1695
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,814
You know, as if--

1696
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,222
The cats are Iike, ''We've
seen the movies, dude.

1697
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:31,259
We know who you are.''

1698
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:33,351
But he was just
so fucking invigorated,

1699
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:35,396
just so fucking rah-rah
and shit Iike that,

1700
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:36,897
and remained that way through

1701
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:38,694
most of the fucking time
we were shooting and whatnot,

1702
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:41,861
and reaIIy took his apartment seriousIy.

1703
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:44,098
In a big, bad way,
dude went back to Target,

1704
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:45,901
bought himseIf a chair.

1705
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,408
Like a chaise Iongue kind of chair
that you take to the beach

1706
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:50,104
and spread out and sit
there and catch waves?

1707
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:52,840
He set it up in front of his room.

1708
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:55,941
And basicaIIy, we had these rooms
on the second fIoor of the moteI,

1709
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:59,476
and they overIooked the parking Iot
or the Mooby's, and we did that because

1710
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,718
we didn't want anybody coming on their
vacation or going to Knott's Berry Farm

1711
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:06,625
going, ''What the fuck is going on?
Why is that dude's dick tucked back?''

1712
01:16:06,695 --> 01:16:10,187
Just so that there'd be no Iookie-Ious
and nobody to have to expIain shit to.

1713
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:13,257
So Mewes is on the second fIoor
with this fucking chair

1714
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:17,533
outside his fucking moteI room
door, hanging out.

1715
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:20,166
Just hanging out, smoking cigarettes,
taIking to peopIe as they waIk by.

1716
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:22,335
''Hey. How are you?
What are you doing today?

1717
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:26,177
I'm pIaying Jay in the movie Clerks ll. ''

1718
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:31,276
Dude went and got himseIf
a hibachi, a IittIe hibachi.

1719
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:35,813
As if he'd watched every TV show
about peopIe who buy their first house

1720
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:40,760
and was Iike, ''I need a chair outside,
and I need a barbecue griII.''

1721
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:45,425
And even though we had catering on the set,
the dude sat there with his IittIe hibachi,

1722
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:49,630
fucking heated it up and shit, and wouId
make fucking food for the cast and crew.

1723
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:54,005
Fucking insane, you know?
Just reaIIy weird behavior.

1724
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:56,567
If I hadn't known better, I wouId been Iike,
''What are you, on heroin?''

1725
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:59,136
But I knew he wasn't anymore.

1726
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:02,115
But he wouId be sitting up there,
and you'd be down directing and shit.

1727
01:17:02,184 --> 01:17:05,642
He'd be up on the second fIoor of the moteI
and shit, fucking cooking

1728
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:07,780
and be Iike, ''You want a dog?
You want a dog? You want a burger?

1729
01:17:07,856 --> 01:17:12,691
Burger, burger, dog? Coming up.''

1730
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:15,924
Whip 'em down to you.
Just a reaI fucking go-getter.

1731
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:20,128
AII about it and so fucking energetic,
and reaIIy pumped everybody eIse up.

1732
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:22,727
He wouId organize activities
when the day was done and shit.

1733
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:26,331
On most movies, peopIe are done shooting,
they want to go home and shit.

1734
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:28,376
Mewes wouId organize poker games.

1735
01:17:28,443 --> 01:17:33,904
Fucking one night, he was Iike,
''We aII have to go out to MedievaI Times.

1736
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:37,509
You're paying, but we aII have to go.''

1737
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:41,147
Just way into it. Way
into the whoIe Clerks ll fucking experience

1738
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:42,656
and way into his fucking apartment,

1739
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:45,591
was dreading when we were
fucking gonna wrap the show

1740
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,129
because we were there,
essentiaIIy, for about three,

1741
01:17:48,196 --> 01:17:49,959
three and a haIf weeks,
four weeks of shooting.

1742
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:53,433
Then we wouId wrap and go to Jersey
to shoot for about a week

1743
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,232
of aII the exteriors of Quick Stop
and shit Iike that.

1744
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:59,273
So we were getting cIose
to the end of the shoot.

1745
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:01,241
And I remember taIking to
him and just being Iike,

1746
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:03,072
''You know we're out of here soon.
Did you start packing?''

1747
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,510
He's Iike, ''What do you mean?''

1748
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:06,103
I was Iike, ''WeII, we have to Ieave.

1749
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,113
When we're done, we're Ieaving.''

1750
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,274
He was Iike, ''ReaIIy?''

1751
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,648
I was Iike, ''WeII, you didn't think
you couId stay here, did you?''

1752
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,846
He was Iike, ''Can you buy these pIaces?''

1753
01:18:14,322 --> 01:18:15,448
I was Iike, ''What,

1754
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:18,118
take the fucking moteI
condo or something?''

1755
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,252
I said, ''You don't even have a kitchen
in this motherfucker.''

1756
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:22,023
He said, ''I got a hot pIate.

1757
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:26,158
PIus, there's a fucking
Mooby's right next door.''

1758
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:38,938
So he's Iike, ''Here I can fuck
anybody I want and shit.

1759
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:41,482
I couId do things that I
can't do back at your house.

1760
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,212
I don't have to ask anybody for permission
and shit Iike that.''

1761
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:45,719
He said, ''I just Iike it here.''

1762
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:47,118
And he's Iike, ''What do you think?

1763
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:48,417
Can I just get this pIace?

1764
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:50,685
How much do you think
it wouId be a month?''

1765
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:52,590
And I said, ''You want to rent this pIace
Iike an apartment?''

1766
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:53,855
I was Iike, ''You couId
probabIy get an apartment

1767
01:18:53,929 --> 01:18:54,987
''back in Los AngeIes

1768
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:56,394
for roughIy what you
wouId pay for this.

1769
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:59,127
Maybe it wouIdn't be--
You'd have a bathroom.

1770
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:00,532
''You'd have to deaI with the fact

1771
01:19:00,602 --> 01:19:03,366
that you had a kitchen.''

1772
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:04,769
But he was Iike, ''I don't know.

1773
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,932
''I'm kinda thinking about staying.

1774
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:07,201
''I'm used to it. I kind of Iike it.

1775
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:08,708
''This is my home now,
and I kind of--

1776
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:11,041
I got my groove on in this joint.''

1777
01:19:11,113 --> 01:19:12,944
I was Iike, ''WeII, I guess you can ask.

1778
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:15,676
The probIem is it becomes
expensive once we Ieave.''

1779
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,218
He's Iike, ''What are you taIking about?

1780
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:18,377
I thought you said
it's 20 bucks a night.''

1781
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:20,182
And I was, ''It's 20 bucks a night now

1782
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:21,847
because we paid for a bunch of rooms

1783
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:22,947
because the production's here,

1784
01:19:23,024 --> 01:19:24,958
because we took up
at Ieast 20 rooms.

1785
01:19:25,026 --> 01:19:27,756
But once we Ieave, it goes
back to its normaI price.''

1786
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:29,421
And he's Iike, ''WeII,
how much is it normaIIy?''

1787
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,125
And I was Iike, ''It's 40 bucks a night.''

1788
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:32,723
''40 bucks a night for this shit hoIe?

1789
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:34,268
Fuck it! Let's go.''

1790
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:42,936
So that was cooI. During
the making of that movie,

1791
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:46,139
he was just a reaI fucking
spirit bunny and shit Iike that.

1792
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:47,306
It was kind of charming.

1793
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:48,815
And then we were done with the movie.

1794
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:50,078
Of aII the IittIe probIems,

1795
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:52,780
there was nothing
insurmountabIe and shit.

1796
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:54,048
We wrapped the fIick,

1797
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:56,056
we showed Harvey Weinstein the movie,

1798
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:58,217
and Harvey was Iike,
''I just got two notes.''

1799
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,624
He's going, ''I think it's reaIIy funny,

1800
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:02,857
but I got two notes.''

1801
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:07,027
He's going, ''You show Rosario
kind of Iike, from here up.''

1802
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:09,969
I was Iike, ''We shot her in cowboy,
cut her off at the knees.''

1803
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:11,903
He's Iike, ''Did you ever
shoot her from head-to-toe?''

1804
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,168
And I was Iike, ''WeII, no. Not reaIIy,

1805
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:17,109
''because they're not reaIIy
doing that much of a dance.''

1806
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:19,647
He's Iike, ''WeII, you got
to shoot her head-to-toe.

1807
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:21,147
''That's how you shoot a dancer.

1808
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:23,377
''You got to see their fuII body.
Shoot a dancer head-to-toe.

1809
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:25,112
''I'II put you on the phone with Rob MarshaII.

1810
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:27,314
''He made Chicago.
He'II teII you the same thing.''

1811
01:20:27,389 --> 01:20:28,686
And I was Iike,

1812
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:32,352
what an awkward caII that wouId be.

1813
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:34,122
I'm Iike, ''Hi, is this Rob MarshaII?''

1814
01:20:34,196 --> 01:20:35,857
He's Iike, ''Yeah, is this Clerks guy?''

1815
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:37,330
I'm Iike, ''Yeah.''

1816
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:39,867
He's Iike, ''WeII, you're
supposed to show a dancer

1817
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:41,493
''from head-to-toe.''

1818
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:43,834
''Look, I got to go, bye.'' You know?

1819
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:47,534
Such a bizarre fucking phone caII
I'd have to sit through.

1820
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:49,509
I was Iike, ''I don't know if we shouId.

1821
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,443
I was Iike, ''HonestIy, they're not doing
much of a dance.''

1822
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:53,344
She's wearing fucking, Iike, cords.

1823
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:55,349
So, what you're seeing
from the knee down

1824
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:56,577
isn't that fucking sexy.

1825
01:20:56,651 --> 01:20:57,982
It's not Iike they're wearing outfits

1826
01:20:58,053 --> 01:20:59,850
Iike they wore in Chicago,
bare-Iegged and shit.

1827
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:01,320
She wearing fucking cords.

1828
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:04,552
I said, ''We're seeing the reaI important part
of the scene.''

1829
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:07,220
The true money,
as it were, and whatnot.

1830
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:09,058
It's not Iike she's doing
some wicked shuffIe

1831
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,290
with her feet that we're missing.

1832
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:12,026
He's Iike, ''I think you shouId re-shoot.

1833
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,567
''I think you shouId
shoot her head-to-toe.''

1834
01:21:13,635 --> 01:21:15,660
I was Iike, ''I guess
we couId taIk about it.

1835
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:16,965
''What's the other thing?''

1836
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:21,270
He's Iike, ''There's that conversation
about the pussy troII.''

1837
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:33,910
I said, ''Yeah, yeah.
Fucking piIIow pants.''

1838
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:35,217
He's Iike, ''Yeah, piIIow pants.''

1839
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:37,087
He's going, ''I reaIIy think--

1840
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:39,626
''You have this whoIe
conversation about this thing,

1841
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:41,025
''and they're sitting there taIking.

1842
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:43,291
''I reaIIy think you need
to show that thing.''

1843
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:52,635
And I was Iike, ''You do know
they don't exist, right?''

1844
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:55,471
He's Iike, ''Yes, I fucking
know they don't exist.

1845
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:57,340
''But you can't just sit there

1846
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:59,505
''and have a fucking conversation
about a pussy troII

1847
01:21:59,581 --> 01:22:00,809
''and not show it.

1848
01:22:00,882 --> 01:22:03,282
''They sit there for two minutes
taIking about this thing,

1849
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:04,750
''and we never get to see it.

1850
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:06,184
''That's just bad cinema.

1851
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,051
''You need to put it in there,
particuIarIy for Europeans.

1852
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:09,522
''They want to see shit.

1853
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,458
''They don't want to hear you
taIking about a pussy troII.

1854
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,051
''You got to fucking shoot a pussy troII

1855
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:15,460
and put it in that movie.''

1856
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,930
I was Iike, ''I don't know how the fuck
we're expected to do that

1857
01:22:17,999 --> 01:22:19,193
''because it doesn't exist.''

1858
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:20,564
The reason that scene works

1859
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:22,830
is because whoever
is watching the movie,

1860
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:27,341
first, they have an idea in their head
of what a pussy troII is.

1861
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,206
And their idea is going to be way better

1862
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:31,245
than anything I couId show them
because in their head,

1863
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:33,281
they can make up aII sorts
of weird nonsense and shit.

1864
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:34,713
I put it out there--

1865
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:37,149
What am I going to do, shove it out
Iike one of those troII doIIs?

1866
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,118
Be Iike, ''This is a pussy troII.''

1867
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:41,655
With my hand hoIding it
on camera and shit?

1868
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:45,124
It wouId Iook Iike
that scene in Spiderman,

1869
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:46,683
where Spiderman and the Green GobIin

1870
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:48,558
are on the top of the buiIding
taIking to one another.

1871
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,222
You got two dudes,
you can't see their mouths.

1872
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:52,630
They're just wearing masks.
They're just taIking Iike this.

1873
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:55,465
It just Iooks Iike peopIe
were hoIding action figures.

1874
01:22:55,537 --> 01:22:58,097
Going, Iike, ''Join me, Spiderman,

1875
01:22:58,173 --> 01:22:59,663
''so we can be fucking cooI buds.''

1876
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:05,338
''I don't want to do that, Green GobIin.''

1877
01:23:05,413 --> 01:23:08,610
So, I was just Iike, ''I just don't--

1878
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:10,708
''The reason I feeI
Iike that scene works is

1879
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:12,650
''you have two guys in that scene.

1880
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:15,622
''There's one guy in the scene
who, with aII of his heart,

1881
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:19,421
''beIieves that there is
such a thing as a pussy troII.

1882
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,325
''And then you have the other guy,

1883
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:25,799
''who represents
everybody eIse in the worId,

1884
01:23:25,867 --> 01:23:28,529
''just reacting to him the way
that most peopIe wouId.

1885
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:30,867
''Just Iike fucking
sheII-shocked, you know,

1886
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:33,840
''jaw dropped, Iike,
'This dude's fucking insane.'

1887
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,239
''That's what's funny about It.

1888
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,470
''The minute you show it,

1889
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:38,034
''you're Iending credence
to the first guy

1890
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:40,445
''because there's a smaII portion
of the audience that's Iike,

1891
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:43,780
'''God damn it, is that
what a pussy troII is?'

1892
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:46,047
''You run the risk
of Iending the idiot credibiIity.

1893
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:47,588
''So I don't think you shouId show it.''

1894
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:49,020
He's Iike, ''I'm going
to demand you show it.

1895
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:50,489
''You shouId fucking do it.

1896
01:23:50,558 --> 01:23:52,458
''I'm going to make you do it
and give you the money.

1897
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:54,825
''You need to show it.
I think it'II make it even funnier.''

1898
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:56,989
So he Ieft, and me and Mosier
were reaIIy sweating it,

1899
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:58,623
Iike, ''What the fuck do we do, man?

1900
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,133
''I don't want to show the pussy troII.

1901
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:01,600
''It's funny because you don't
show the pussy troII.

1902
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:04,502
''It's just chatter,
something to fucking taIk about.''

1903
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:08,565
I was Iike, ''Maybe we
just fucking dress up Mewes as a troII.''

1904
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:16,241
''And just buiId a giant
wooden Iabia around him.

1905
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:18,182
''Just have him sit under it, going Iike--''

1906
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,760
And, you know, Mosier's
aII Iaid back, smooth.

1907
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:27,920
He's Iike, ''CouId work.''

1908
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,964
So I hit up Mewes, I was Iike,

1909
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:32,727
''Dude, we might need ''to go back
and do a IittIe re-shooting.''

1910
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:34,132
He's Iike, ''What?''

1911
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:37,035
I was Iike, ''We're going to need
to shoot the pussy troII.''

1912
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:38,595
He was Iike, ''Those things exist?''

1913
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:40,504
I was Iike, ''No.''

1914
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:42,702
I was Iike, ''But we might need

1915
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:46,008
''to dress you up Iike a pussy troII,

1916
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,742
''and then fucking paint you green.

1917
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:51,217
''Put a IittIe fucking tutu
on you, and a mean face,

1918
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:54,153
''and fucking teeth,
fangs, and weird hair.

1919
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:56,019
''And buiId a giant
wooden pussy around you

1920
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,558
''to fucking dance in.''

1921
01:24:57,625 --> 01:25:01,083
I was Iike, ''We won't hoId on
it Iong, just a few seconds.''

1922
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:02,561
He was just Iike, ''I'II do it

1923
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:08,762
if I can keep the giant wooden pussy
when you're done.''

1924
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:13,137
Then we were at the fucking premiere.

1925
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:16,200
Mewes comes up to me, goes
''Dude, what happened?

1926
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:20,179
''Wasn't I supposed
to pIay the pussy troII?''

1927
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:21,681
And I was Iike, ''Yeah, dude,

1928
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:23,410
but didn't we ever taIk about that?

1929
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:25,180
''We didn't wind up
re-shooting it, obviousIy.

1930
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:27,813
''You've seen the movie.
There's no pussy troII in it.

1931
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:29,447
''You're not in there as the pussy troII.

1932
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:30,889
''We didn't do it.''

1933
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:34,258
He's Iike, ''No, I get that.
It just kind of sucks.''

1934
01:25:34,329 --> 01:25:35,728
I was Iike, ''The movie?''

1935
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,492
He's Iike, ''No, but
it wouId have been nice.''

1936
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:39,294
I was Iike, ''You think that
wouId have been funny?''

1937
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,733
He's Iike, ''I just wanted
the giant wooden pussy for my--

1938
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:44,363
for the door of my apartment.''

1939
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:48,500
He wanted to just
put it right outside his door.

1940
01:25:48,576 --> 01:25:51,044
So you'd come, you'd show up,
go to knock on the door,

1941
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:53,842
and be Iike, ''I get it.

1942
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:55,610
''He's obviousIy a fan.''

1943
01:25:55,683 --> 01:25:58,652
So, that was just a great
fucking experience.

1944
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:01,348
Went to Cannes, got
a standing ovation for it,

1945
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:03,947
and it was just a wonderfuIIy
wonderfuI, bIessed experience.

1946
01:26:04,025 --> 01:26:09,964
Every part of that was fucking great.

1947
01:26:10,031 --> 01:26:11,589
How are you, sir?

1948
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:12,928
I'm pretty good.

1949
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,628
Look, you kind of came
dressed in costume.

1950
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:18,103
- Thanks.
- So did I.

1951
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,971
WeII, I can't beat that guy's offer, but--

1952
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:22,509
[audience member]
Do it!

1953
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:23,805
[audience member]
Go!

1954
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:25,505
I read on the boards a whiIe back,

1955
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,775
and the guy who asked
the first question reminded me about it.

1956
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,510
But I heard you had
an interesting encounter

1957
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:31,415
with Anakin SkywaIker?

1958
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:32,748
With Anakin Sky--

1959
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,253
- Hayden Christensen?
- Yeah.

1960
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:36,290
I did have a moment
with Hayden Christensen.

1961
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:38,450
It wasn't reaIIy an encounter
because I never met the dude.

1962
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:40,790
When we were doing Clerks ll,

1963
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,592
we put traiIers out on the Internet.

1964
01:26:43,665 --> 01:26:45,690
First traiIer we did that had diaIogue,

1965
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:46,927
not the teaser one,

1966
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:50,437
was that moment
where Kevin Weisman,

1967
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:52,439
who pIayed
the Lord of the Rings fan,

1968
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:54,338
was doing, ''My name is Anakin.

1969
01:26:54,409 --> 01:26:59,608
My shitty acting is ruining saga.''

1970
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:01,808
So that was in the traiIer.

1971
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,545
And we'd fucking mixed, up at SkywaIker

1972
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:05,847
ever since Dogma,

1973
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,115
before, where we mixed
aII our movies up there.

1974
01:27:08,189 --> 01:27:10,248
So I get a caII
from somebody at SkywaIker,

1975
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:12,418
and they were just Iike,
''We got a probIem.''

1976
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:14,222
I was Iike, ''What is it?''

1977
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:15,956
They were Iike, ''Hayden Christensen

1978
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:18,362
''saw that traiIer for Clerks ll onIine,

1979
01:27:18,433 --> 01:27:20,867
and he's pissed.''

1980
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:22,266
And I was Iike, ''ReaIIy?''

1981
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:24,305
They're Iike, ''Yeah, he
caIIed up, and he was mad.

1982
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:26,499
''And he was demanding
that we sue you.''

1983
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:28,940
I was Iike, ''Why?''

1984
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:31,171
He was Iike,
''Because you made fun of him,

1985
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:33,146
and he feeIs Iike
it made him Iook bad.''

1986
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:35,546
I was Iike, ''I wrote
a fucking steIIar review

1987
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:37,710
''of Attack of the Clones, man.

1988
01:27:37,785 --> 01:27:39,116
Didn't he ever see that?''

1989
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:40,484
I was aII for that dude.

1990
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:42,523
Other peopIe attacked him,
said he was a whiny emo kid.

1991
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:46,287
But I said that was
what the roIe caIIed for.

1992
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:47,521
I thought he was great.

1993
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,392
I was Iike, ''Why is he
fucking mad at me?

1994
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:51,193
Doesn't he know
I'm a big Star Wars fan?

1995
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:54,497
He was Iike, ''He fucking feIt
Iike you went after him.

1996
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:58,300
''So, he's asking
fucking George to sue you.

1997
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:01,570
''But George is Iike,
'What are you taIking about?

1998
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:04,077
'''You can't sue somebody
for making a joke and shit.

1999
01:28:04,145 --> 01:28:05,806
''He's making a big stink about it.

2000
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:07,370
''Can you fucking drop him a Iine,

2001
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:09,279
and teII him something
that'II make him feeI better?''

2002
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:11,750
I said, ''Yeah.''
So I wrote the dude an e-maiI

2003
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:13,411
that I sent to this dude at SkywaIker.

2004
01:28:13,488 --> 01:28:15,046
I said, ''Here are Iinks to some nice shit

2005
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:16,488
''I said about his performance
in other pIaces.

2006
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:19,185
''But just teII him it's aII jokes, dude.

2007
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,285
''If you see the movie in context,

2008
01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:22,920
it's very pro Star Wars.

2009
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:24,828
''RandaI, who's kind of
the hero of the movie,

2010
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:26,423
''is aII for fucking Star Wars,

2011
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:27,900
and he doesn't come down

2012
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:31,029
''on fucking Hayden's
portrayaI of Anakin SkywaIker.

2013
01:28:31,105 --> 01:28:32,834
''The other dude, who's the guy

2014
01:28:32,907 --> 01:28:34,204
''who's made to Iook Iike an idiot

2015
01:28:34,275 --> 01:28:35,537
''and he fucking pukes

2016
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:38,044
''is a big Lord of the Rings
jerk and shit.

2017
01:28:38,112 --> 01:28:40,080
''That dude's the dude
saying the bad shit.

2018
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,378
''I understand we're trying
to have our cake and eat it too.

2019
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:44,714
''But, at the end of the day,
RandaI's kind of for him,

2020
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:46,151
''aIthough he never says he is,

2021
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,687
''But he's anti Rings,

2022
01:28:47,755 --> 01:28:50,485
''so that makes him pro
fucking Star Wars trilogies. ''

2023
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:52,822
The dude's Iike, ''You're reaIIy
back-pedaIing right now.''

2024
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:54,225
I was Iike, ''I kind of am.''

2025
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:56,763
I just never expected this
to come out of someone

2026
01:28:56,831 --> 01:28:59,129
because it was just
so fucked up, so strange.

2027
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,360
Darth Vader,

2028
01:29:00,435 --> 01:29:02,630
the biggest bad-ass
in the fucking gaIaxy

2029
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:04,035
is the dude who's Iike,

2030
01:29:04,105 --> 01:29:10,977
''I'm going to sue you
for making fun of me.''

2031
01:29:11,045 --> 01:29:13,605
I just have this picture
of him seeing that traiIer

2032
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:17,208
and being Iike, ''No!''

2033
01:29:17,285 --> 01:29:19,310
[cheering, appIause]

2034
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:33,926
I fucking Iove me
some Revenge of the Sith.

2035
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:36,231
But that was the siIIiest
moment in that movie.

2036
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:38,465
There are things you can
attack about that movie

2037
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:39,767
that I'II defend and shit,

2038
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:41,274
but there is no defense against

2039
01:29:41,342 --> 01:29:45,608
''No!''

2040
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:48,843
Just because you've never
heard Darth Vader be Iike that.

2041
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:50,679
Even when he Ioses at the end
of Empire Strikes Back,

2042
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:52,447
he's just pimped out
on the bridge and shit,

2043
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,648
Iooking out the window,
Iike, ''I'II get him, sooner or Iater.''

2044
01:29:55,723 --> 01:30:00,751
But fucking to see him break down
Iike a whiny emo bitch,

2045
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:05,128
''No!''

2046
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:07,258
That was kind of indefensibIe.

2047
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:11,032
But, so, yeah. That was
the Iast I heard about it.

2048
01:30:11,105 --> 01:30:12,333
We said we weren't gonna take it out,

2049
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:14,875
Fucking Lucas FiIms
and SkywaIker were Iike,

2050
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:16,842
''We're not asking you to take it out.''

2051
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:19,345
''We think it's funny.''

2052
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:21,644
PIus, they'd seen the movie
because we mix there.

2053
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:23,707
They're Iike, ''We get it.
You're fucking pro Star Wars.

2054
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:25,309
''Not Iike you're coming down
against it and shit.

2055
01:30:25,386 --> 01:30:28,787
''You're just taking a shot
and it's a kind of funny shot.''

2056
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:30,153
But that was that.

2057
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:32,249
It's kind of strange, though.
Kind of weird.

2058
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:34,760
Now I'm kind of afraid
to run into the dude.

2059
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:38,128
Have that mean face on me.
And he's a pretty man, too.

2060
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:39,564
He's one of those reaIIy pretty dudes.

2061
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:41,431
So if he's Iooking at me
with a mean face,

2062
01:30:41,502 --> 01:30:45,632
I'II be Iike, ''You're so cute.

2063
01:30:45,706 --> 01:30:49,642
''What can I do
to make you smiIe, Hayden?''

2064
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:52,838
But that was it. Never met him.
Never ran into him.

2065
01:30:52,914 --> 01:30:55,246
Just heard that
he was a whiny, IittIe fuck

2066
01:30:55,316 --> 01:30:56,840
who didn't Iike us making fun of him.

2067
01:30:57,552 --> 01:31:00,248
But, you know, fucking,
there were peopIe--

2068
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:02,346
Entourage, a show on HBO,

2069
01:31:02,423 --> 01:31:04,721
taking two shots at me in the past.

2070
01:31:04,792 --> 01:31:07,693
An episode where they went
to Sundance and shit,

2071
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:10,162
where Ari GoId was just Iike,
''If it weren't for me--''

2072
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:11,630
There was a Harvey Weinstein
type character,

2073
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:13,963
- I forget what his name was, but--
- Harvey.

2074
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:15,696
It was Harvey?

2075
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:18,534
That's some briIIiant writing.

2076
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:19,937
He's just Iike,

2077
01:31:20,007 --> 01:31:21,531
''If it weren't for me,
Harvey wouId be stuck

2078
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,804
''making Kevin Smith movies
his whoIe career.''

2079
01:31:23,878 --> 01:31:26,574
It was Iike, ooh, I feIt Iike
I got tagged on that one.

2080
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:27,978
But I Iike that show,

2081
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:31,644
so I was Iike,
''They fucking said my name.''

2082
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:34,085
My wife, she don't Iike
the show. She won't watch it.

2083
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:39,286
But I was Iike,
''You got to fucking Iook.

2084
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:43,660
''I'm Kevin Smith, man.

2085
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:45,790
And she's Iike,
''They're making fun of you.''

2086
01:31:45,867 --> 01:31:47,664
I was Iike, ''I don't care. I Iike the show.

2087
01:31:47,735 --> 01:31:49,726
''They said my name
on the fucking TV show.''

2088
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:51,237
I Iove hearing my name on TV.

2089
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:54,331
I grew up watching TV,
so hearing my name on TV,

2090
01:31:54,408 --> 01:31:57,138
I'm Iike, ''The magic box said my name.''

2091
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:58,542
[appIause]

2092
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:04,641
So they did that once on Entourage,

2093
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:07,119
and then, a coupIe seasons Iater,
they did it again.

2094
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:08,712
This time, it was a IittIe more.

2095
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:11,349
They tried to jab the knife
in a IittIe bit more.

2096
01:32:11,425 --> 01:32:12,949
They were taIking about--

2097
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:14,551
They were shooting Aquaman 2.

2098
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:16,597
There was a possibiIity
of the main character,

2099
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:18,564
what's his name?

2100
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:19,964
Vinnie Chase.

2101
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:21,558
Chase, Vincent Chase.

2102
01:32:21,636 --> 01:32:23,297
Vince Chase had done Aquaman,

2103
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:26,602
and they wanted to rush
the sequeI into production.

2104
01:32:26,674 --> 01:32:28,904
They were-- He didn't want to do it

2105
01:32:28,976 --> 01:32:31,945
because he wanted to shoot
the fucking Medelln movie.

2106
01:32:32,013 --> 01:32:34,538
And so, they were Iike,

2107
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:36,606
''WeII, it's going,
and you got to be in it.''

2108
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:38,049
And he's Iike, ''Who's directing it?

2109
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:39,552
Because Jim can't be ready--''

2110
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:42,088
Jim Cameron, in Entourage,
directed the first one.

2111
01:32:42,156 --> 01:32:43,714
He's Iike, ''Jim can't possibIy
be ready to shoot 2.''

2112
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:45,190
They're Iike, ''Not going with Jim Cameron.

2113
01:32:45,259 --> 01:32:47,159
They're going with MichaeI Bay.

2114
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:51,187
Him and his entourage of buddies
were Iike, ''Jesus, no.''

2115
01:32:51,265 --> 01:32:52,755
They're Iike, ''WeII, who's writing it?''

2116
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:54,528
They're Iike, ''Kevin's writing it.''

2117
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:56,126
''Like, Kevin WaIker?
Andrew Kevin WaIker?

2118
01:32:56,203 --> 01:32:57,727
''The dude who wrote Seven?''

2119
01:32:57,805 --> 01:33:00,103
Because he wrote the imaginary
Aquaman in the movie.

2120
01:33:00,174 --> 01:33:01,801
''Is Kevin writing it?''
They're Iike, ''Kevin Smith.''

2121
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:07,109
And they're Iike, ''Fuck.''

2122
01:33:07,181 --> 01:33:09,274
At that moment,

2123
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:12,877
I was just Iike,
''They said my name, man.

2124
01:33:12,954 --> 01:33:15,354
''That I was fucking writing
Aquaman 2 and shit.''

2125
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:19,519
My wife, again, was Iike,
''You're a fucking idiot, man.

2126
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,721
''They're mocking you, you fucking fooI.''

2127
01:33:21,796 --> 01:33:23,457
I was Iike, ''What?'' And I rewound it.

2128
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:29,436
I was Iike, ''Oh, I'm never working
with fucking Vincent Chase, ever.''

2129
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:30,731
But I took that in stride.

2130
01:33:30,805 --> 01:33:32,796
I thought that was kind of a cooI thing.

2131
01:33:32,873 --> 01:33:34,841
Every knock is a fucking boost,

2132
01:33:34,909 --> 01:33:37,537
as Iong as they fucking
get your name kind of right.

2133
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,477
Even if they were Iike, ''Kevin Smith,

2134
01:33:39,547 --> 01:33:41,208
''he fucking takes
nine cocks in the ass,

2135
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:42,681
''three in the mouth, you know?

2136
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:47,517
''One under each armpit,
and does this.''

2137
01:33:47,588 --> 01:33:50,421
I'd be Iike,
''They said my fucking name!''

2138
01:33:50,491 --> 01:33:53,460
So, you know, I've been made fun of.

2139
01:33:53,527 --> 01:33:55,893
Didn't fucking--
I didn't caII up fucking HBO,

2140
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:58,488
Iike, ''I'm canceIing my subscription.''

2141
01:33:58,566 --> 01:34:00,295
I immediateIy caIIed up my agent.

2142
01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:02,461
I was Iike, ''Get me on Entourage, dude,

2143
01:34:02,536 --> 01:34:04,561
''so I can bitch-sIap Ari GoId.''

2144
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:05,799
[audience member]
Yeah.

2145
01:34:11,345 --> 01:34:13,609
Ran into Jeremy Piven

2146
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:15,205
at the Independent Spirit Awards--

2147
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:16,647
not this year, but Iast year.

2148
01:34:16,717 --> 01:34:19,117
Said hi, he said hi.
We chit-chatted for a second.

2149
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:20,517
Never once, was I Iike,

2150
01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:22,954
''Hey, man,
why'd you make fun of me?''

2151
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:24,457
I was Iike, ''Right on.

2152
01:34:24,525 --> 01:34:26,288
''You guys said my name.
That's fucking cooI.''

2153
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,487
So I don't understand
why Hayden got aII out of sorts about it.

2154
01:34:28,562 --> 01:34:30,962
The weird thing
about Entourage, though,

2155
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:34,001
is peopIe do think
that show is fucking reaI.

2156
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:37,162
They fucking beIieve it,
Iike, you read about and shit.

2157
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:39,866
Because I had peopIe coming up to me
for the next six months,

2158
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:41,305
going, ''Dude, you're doing Aquaman 2.

2159
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:43,502
''That's awesome.''

2160
01:34:43,577 --> 01:34:46,045
And I wouId be Iike,

2161
01:34:46,113 --> 01:34:52,018
''Do you remember seeing Aquaman 1?

2162
01:34:52,086 --> 01:34:53,610
So I don't know.

2163
01:34:53,688 --> 01:34:56,350
Didn't know why that dude
got out of sorts, but he did.

2164
01:34:56,424 --> 01:34:57,982
HopefuIIy, that's in the past.

2165
01:34:58,059 --> 01:34:59,549
[appIause]

2166
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:02,758
Hey, Kevin.

2167
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:04,229
When's AffIeck going to do SModcast?

2168
01:35:04,298 --> 01:35:07,062
AffIeck on SModcast?

2169
01:35:07,134 --> 01:35:08,396
And be candid.

2170
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:09,993
[cheering, appIause]

2171
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:12,571
He'd be good, man.

2172
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,631
Because he's good
on the fucking commentary--

2173
01:35:14,709 --> 01:35:15,835
WouId he be candid, though?

2174
01:35:15,910 --> 01:35:19,004
TaIk about some reaI shit,
with J-Lo and Gwyneth?

2175
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,241
- Oh, he'II never do that.
- No.

2176
01:35:21,315 --> 01:35:24,148
You won't get that.
That AffIeck's gone, man.

2177
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:26,345
That AffIeck is there, in private.

2178
01:35:26,420 --> 01:35:27,751
If you taIk to him and shit,

2179
01:35:27,822 --> 01:35:29,619
he's stiII fucking same oId AffIeck.

2180
01:35:29,690 --> 01:35:33,023
But pubIicIy, that AffIeck hasn't existed
in quite some time.

2181
01:35:33,094 --> 01:35:34,891
The one who's reaIIy candid,

2182
01:35:34,962 --> 01:35:38,363
and he's just Iike,
''Let me teII you who I hate.''

2183
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:40,992
Because it used to be fun.
We'd just do it together.

2184
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:42,501
He'd read my interviews, I'd read his.

2185
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:43,764
I'd be Iike, ''That's awesome.

2186
01:35:43,838 --> 01:35:45,169
You fucking dropped science

2187
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,866
and fucking caIIed this person
a fooI and shit Iike that.

2188
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:48,875
That dude's gone.

2189
01:35:48,943 --> 01:35:50,467
The pubIic face of that dude.

2190
01:35:50,544 --> 01:35:51,909
You just can't do it anymore.

2191
01:35:51,979 --> 01:35:54,504
I can get out there and be Iike,
''This person's a jackass.''

2192
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,607
And the onIy peopIe that read about it
are peopIe onIine.

2193
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:58,151
AffIeck caIIs somebody a jackass,

2194
01:35:58,219 --> 01:36:01,484
it winds up in every
fucking trade pubIication.

2195
01:36:01,555 --> 01:36:04,115
It winds up in the rags
and the fucking tabIoids.

2196
01:36:04,191 --> 01:36:05,453
It winds up fucking everywhere,

2197
01:36:05,526 --> 01:36:06,993
Top story, Entertainment Tonight.

2198
01:36:07,061 --> 01:36:09,529
''AffIeck caIIed somebody a jackass.''

2199
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:14,193
''AffIeck at war, day 1 .''

2200
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:16,168
But I remember that transition.

2201
01:36:16,237 --> 01:36:18,467
I remember watching him
give an interview,

2202
01:36:18,539 --> 01:36:20,234
and I was Iike,
''Dude, what happened?

2203
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:21,968
''You're not dropping
any cooI fucking stories.

2204
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:23,600
''That one story about this dude.

2205
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:25,144
''You shouId teII that story.
That's fucking funny.''

2206
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:27,146
He's Iike, ''I can't do that anymore, dude.''

2207
01:36:27,214 --> 01:36:28,408
''It's just, I'm too high-profiIe.

2208
01:36:28,482 --> 01:36:30,473
''If I say something about somebody,

2209
01:36:30,551 --> 01:36:32,815
''I'm going to get in troubIe,
I'm going to hear about it.

2210
01:36:32,887 --> 01:36:34,354
''There's no end
to the fucking probIems.

2211
01:36:34,421 --> 01:36:36,616
''I got to write
an apoIogy note. Fuck that.

2212
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:38,248
''I'm just not into it anymore.''

2213
01:36:38,325 --> 01:36:40,259
So, I do kind of miss that dude.

2214
01:36:40,327 --> 01:36:43,592
When we were doing
Jersey Girl, we did a--

2215
01:36:43,664 --> 01:36:45,564
No, no, no. That was not
a pause for appIause.

2216
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:46,964
I was wiping sweat off my nose.

2217
01:36:47,034 --> 01:36:51,300
It wasn't Iike,
''When we did Jersey Girl''--

2218
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:54,068
That was me pausing to go,
''When we did Jersey Girl''--

2219
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:57,838
Jesus Christ, I'm so hot.

2220
01:36:57,912 --> 01:36:59,539
We were promoting the fIick,

2221
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:02,138
and we did an interview with--

2222
01:37:02,216 --> 01:37:03,547
What's the chick's name?

2223
01:37:03,617 --> 01:37:06,984
She does the CBS News now?

2224
01:37:07,054 --> 01:37:08,351
Katie Couric.

2225
01:37:08,422 --> 01:37:11,118
I'm getting oId, dude. 37, you forget shit.

2226
01:37:11,192 --> 01:37:14,525
Katie Couric was
on the Today Show at the time.

2227
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:16,859
She sat down for an
excIusive with AffIeck.

2228
01:37:16,931 --> 01:37:18,660
and they shoehorned me
into that interview.

2229
01:37:18,732 --> 01:37:20,165
It was so uncomfortabIe
because I'm Iike,

2230
01:37:20,234 --> 01:37:21,963
''This broad don't want to taIk to me.''

2231
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:24,095
She just wants to taIk
to the famous dude.

2232
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:25,729
But I guess it was a 2 for 1 deaI.

2233
01:37:25,806 --> 01:37:27,569
Or he was Iike,
''I ain't doing it by myseIf.

2234
01:37:27,641 --> 01:37:28,903
You got to be there to fucking defIect,

2235
01:37:28,976 --> 01:37:32,468
so it's not aII about
Jennifer Lopez and shit.

2236
01:37:32,546 --> 01:37:34,275
So, we're sitting there,
doing the interview.

2237
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:38,307
I remember, the interview
is kind of very faciIe and superficiaI

2238
01:37:38,385 --> 01:37:40,945
and poIite and nice.

2239
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:42,386
And he's kind of, ''Aw, shucks.''

2240
01:37:42,456 --> 01:37:44,515
And I'm not saying this
in a way of, Iike,

2241
01:37:44,592 --> 01:37:46,822
he shouId have fucking come out
with fucking guns bIazing.

2242
01:37:46,894 --> 01:37:47,986
But it was just Iike,

2243
01:37:48,062 --> 01:37:50,690
what a waste of time for everybody

2244
01:37:50,764 --> 01:37:52,163
I certainIy didn't want to be there.

2245
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:54,064
I know that broad didn't want me there.

2246
01:37:54,134 --> 01:37:56,102
He wanted me there because he
didn't want to do it by himseIf,

2247
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:57,865
but he didn't want to do it
in the first pIace.

2248
01:37:57,938 --> 01:37:59,462
But he had to do it
to promote the movie.

2249
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:00,871
Nothing good comes out of this.

2250
01:38:00,941 --> 01:38:02,875
It's not Iike you have
a reaI fucking chat

2251
01:38:02,943 --> 01:38:04,706
and fucking cooI shit
comes out, and you're Iike,

2252
01:38:04,778 --> 01:38:06,712
''What a fascinating fucking interview.

2253
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:08,645
''Yes, he torpedoed his career,

2254
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:10,343
''but it was a great interview.''

2255
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:13,250
It was just so fucking
stupid and shit.

2256
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:14,912
But I aIso remember thinking,

2257
01:38:14,989 --> 01:38:17,253
if he gave this broad haIf an inch,

2258
01:38:17,324 --> 01:38:20,122
she wouId suck the fucking
baIIs off of his body.

2259
01:38:20,194 --> 01:38:22,389
She was so into him, man.

2260
01:38:22,463 --> 01:38:25,296
Like, everything he said, she was Iike--

2261
01:38:25,366 --> 01:38:27,857
I was Iike, ''This is a newswoman,

2262
01:38:27,935 --> 01:38:29,562
Iike a hardcore journaIist.''

2263
01:38:29,637 --> 01:38:32,629
And she's just Iike,
''You're cute, you know that?''

2264
01:38:32,706 --> 01:38:33,968
And he's Iike, ''Stop it.''

2265
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:36,509
She's Iike, ''You are adorabIe,
Ben AffIeck.''

2266
01:38:36,577 --> 01:38:39,273
I'm Iike, ''Haven't you spoken
to fucking sitting presidents

2267
01:38:39,346 --> 01:38:41,814
''and fucking Kissinger
and shit Iike that?

2268
01:38:41,882 --> 01:38:44,077
''And you're just bIowing this dude
because he's famous.

2269
01:38:44,151 --> 01:38:45,778
And, yeah, he's handsome,
but stiII, you know,

2270
01:38:45,853 --> 01:38:48,481
Iike, show some fucking dignity, man.''

2271
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:50,489
And I remember,
we were doing some B-roII

2272
01:38:50,557 --> 01:38:53,583
of us waIking aIong
the boardwaIk in Asbury Park.

2273
01:38:53,661 --> 01:38:55,322
It was, IiteraIIy--

2274
01:38:55,396 --> 01:38:57,193
Again, I'm breathing.

2275
01:38:57,264 --> 01:39:00,995
It was IiteraIIy Iike being
the third wheeI on somebody's date.

2276
01:39:03,203 --> 01:39:04,500
kind of waIking and taIking and shit.''

2277
01:39:04,571 --> 01:39:05,902
And those two were waIking.

2278
01:39:05,973 --> 01:39:08,373
She was Iinked arms with him
and shit Iike that.

2279
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:11,070
And I was the fat friend
just foIIowing behind.

2280
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:17,918
[Man]
Hey, how's it going?

2281
01:39:17,985 --> 01:39:20,351
Why does Mewes caII you Moves?

2282
01:39:20,421 --> 01:39:21,945
Why does Mewes caII me Moves?

2283
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:23,751
There was a time, beIieve it or not,

2284
01:39:23,824 --> 01:39:27,089
when I fucked more peopIe
than Jason Mewes.

2285
01:39:27,161 --> 01:39:30,562
It was a Iong, Iong time ago.

2286
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:32,599
Because when I started
hanging out with Mewes,

2287
01:39:32,666 --> 01:39:34,998
he was a virgin, and he was Iike,
''I'm straight-edge, dude.

2288
01:39:35,069 --> 01:39:36,696
''No booze, no drugs, no chicks.''

2289
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:39,330
I was Iike, ''I don't remember

2290
01:39:39,406 --> 01:39:41,397
''that being part
of the straight-edge code, dude.''

2291
01:39:41,475 --> 01:39:43,739
The Iast part, and shit.

2292
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:45,711
He was aII kind of shy
around chicks and whatnot.

2293
01:39:45,779 --> 01:39:48,475
FinaIIy, he started getting Iaid,
Iater in Iife.

2294
01:39:48,549 --> 01:39:51,279
Then once he started fucking,
he never stopped.

2295
01:39:51,352 --> 01:39:52,614
Dude's fucked a Iot of peopIe.

2296
01:39:52,686 --> 01:39:55,246
I remember taIking to him
after he got out of rehab

2297
01:39:55,322 --> 01:39:56,619
the Iast time he went to rehab.

2298
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:58,783
And he was at my house
for about a month.

2299
01:39:58,859 --> 01:40:00,622
Every day, I wouId taIk
to him after he got out,

2300
01:40:00,694 --> 01:40:02,924
and I'd just be Iike, ''How
do you feeI? How you feeIing?

2301
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,225
''Do you feeI Iike you want
to use drugs?

2302
01:40:04,298 --> 01:40:05,822
''Are you tempted?

2303
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:08,026
Have you come across anybody
that's offering you drugs?''

2304
01:40:08,102 --> 01:40:10,627
And he couId just taIk to me.
Just aIways taIking it out.

2305
01:40:10,704 --> 01:40:12,797
So he can kind of put it on Front Street.

2306
01:40:12,873 --> 01:40:14,966
It was the one month anniversary
of him getting out of rehab.

2307
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:16,339
He'd been cIean
and sober for a month.

2308
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:17,707
He was staying at my house.

2309
01:40:17,778 --> 01:40:20,474
And he was going out
quite activeIy at night.

2310
01:40:20,547 --> 01:40:22,105
Just going out and partying and shit.

2311
01:40:22,182 --> 01:40:23,240
But not doing drugs.

2312
01:40:23,317 --> 01:40:25,649
He wouId go out to cIubs
with his friends.

2313
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:27,653
It was him, and Jack Osbourne,

2314
01:40:27,721 --> 01:40:30,155
and this dude Mike McGinnis,
and this dude MiIo.

2315
01:40:30,224 --> 01:40:32,749
They wouId go out and shit
and go to cIubs,

2316
01:40:32,826 --> 01:40:34,088
go to the Spider CIub.

2317
01:40:34,161 --> 01:40:35,389
Everyone around him
wouId be drinking.

2318
01:40:35,462 --> 01:40:36,588
They'd be drinking Red BuII and shit.

2319
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:39,257
Red BuII reaIIy shouId
change their campaign to

2320
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:42,860
''If you just quit heroin,
Red BuII's for you.''

2321
01:40:42,936 --> 01:40:44,369
Because I swear to God,

2322
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:46,201
Mewes drank more fucking Red BuII

2323
01:40:46,273 --> 01:40:49,470
than I've seen anyone drink of any Iiquid
in my fucking Iife.

2324
01:40:49,543 --> 01:40:50,874
Just Iike--
[imitates pop top opening]

2325
01:40:52,913 --> 01:40:55,177
Just bangin' them.
And I was Iike, ''Dude, how--''

2326
01:40:55,249 --> 01:40:57,376
I watched him drink
two six-packs of Red BuII.

2327
01:40:57,451 --> 01:40:58,509
They come in four-packs,

2328
01:40:58,585 --> 01:41:00,519
but I don't know how he did it.

2329
01:41:01,922 --> 01:41:03,514
In the span of 20 minutes.

2330
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:06,218
I'm Iike, ''Dude, how does your heart
not fucking expIode?''

2331
01:41:06,293 --> 01:41:07,624
He's Iike, ''Come on, dude.

2332
01:41:07,694 --> 01:41:10,390
I fucking used to do heroin.''

2333
01:41:10,464 --> 01:41:11,726
I was Iike, ''I guess you're right.''

2334
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:13,699
So him and his boys wouId go out

2335
01:41:13,767 --> 01:41:15,962
and go to cIubs and shit,
and go dancing.

2336
01:41:16,036 --> 01:41:18,470
They wouId hang around peopIe
who drank and did drugs--

2337
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:20,166
They didn't do drugs,
but they drank at cIubs.

2338
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,504
And he wouIdn't partake in shit.

2339
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:25,477
They caIIed their IittIe group
''Project FaIcon,''

2340
01:41:25,546 --> 01:41:27,980
which is a IittIe gay, but...

2341
01:41:28,048 --> 01:41:30,778
They'd be Iike ''We Iike to go to cIubs

2342
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:33,513
''and act a fooI and shit Iike that
and dance and mack on girIs.

2343
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:35,782
''But we just don't need
to drink to do it and shit.''

2344
01:41:35,856 --> 01:41:37,289
They aII moved in together.

2345
01:41:37,357 --> 01:41:40,190
When he finaIIy moved out of my house,
he moved in with those dudes.

2346
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:43,354
They caIIed it the FaIcons' Nest.

2347
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:45,762
A IittIe gay.

2348
01:41:45,833 --> 01:41:48,996
But anyway, we're taIking to him

2349
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:50,263
one month out of rehab,

2350
01:41:50,337 --> 01:41:51,998
I was Iike,
''So how do you feeI, dude?

2351
01:41:52,072 --> 01:41:54,768
It's been one month.
What's it been Iike for you?''

2352
01:41:54,842 --> 01:41:57,606
He's Iike, ''It's been pretty--
it's been pretty good.''

2353
01:41:57,678 --> 01:41:59,805
''I feeI okay.
It doesn't seem to affect me.

2354
01:41:59,880 --> 01:42:01,575
''I was afraid I'd come out of rehab

2355
01:42:01,648 --> 01:42:03,081
and wouIdn't do things I used to.

2356
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:04,947
''But I do, I just don't do drugs,
and I don't drink.

2357
01:42:05,018 --> 01:42:06,645
''I can stiII hang out with my friends.

2358
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:10,281
And since they're cIean,
it aII works out and shit.''

2359
01:42:10,357 --> 01:42:12,621
I said, ''How is it with you and the girIs?''

2360
01:42:12,693 --> 01:42:14,422
''Because I imagine girIs are drinking,

2361
01:42:14,495 --> 01:42:15,621
and you fucking kiss girIs,

2362
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:17,664
''and they've had booze
on their fucking breath.

2363
01:42:17,731 --> 01:42:19,926
''Do you get a taste for it?
And you're Iike--

2364
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,434
''Like the shark in Finding Nemo?''

2365
01:42:22,503 --> 01:42:26,667
So he's Iike, ''No, it's Iike,
basicaIIy, I kiss them.

2366
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,401
''Sometimes I taste booze
in their mouth.

2367
01:42:28,475 --> 01:42:32,002
''It doesn't make me want
to eat their head or something.

2368
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:34,775
''But it doesn't make me
want to drink or anything.''

2369
01:42:34,848 --> 01:42:36,839
I was Iike, ''How is the girI situation?

2370
01:42:36,917 --> 01:42:39,647
''How you been doing
in that department since you got out?''

2371
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:41,984
He's Iike, ''That's where
I'm having a bit of a probIem.''

2372
01:42:42,055 --> 01:42:43,784
I was Iike, ''It's tough getting
back in the saddIe, right?''

2373
01:42:43,857 --> 01:42:45,324
He's Iike, ''The opposite, dude.''

2374
01:42:45,392 --> 01:42:46,654
I was Iike, ''What do you mean?''

2375
01:42:46,727 --> 01:42:51,255
He's Iike, ''I've been out for 30 days,
I've had sex with 28 different girIs.''

2376
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:52,855
Damn!

2377
01:42:52,933 --> 01:42:56,664
I was Iike, ''Get the fuck out of here, man!

2378
01:42:56,737 --> 01:42:59,365
How is that fucking possibIe?''

2379
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:00,872
He's just Iike, ''I don't know.

2380
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:03,842
Chicks just dig the Mewes, man.''

2381
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:07,312
But there was a time in his Iife
where he was not the guy.

2382
01:43:07,381 --> 01:43:09,406
He was the guy who didn't know
how to fuck broads,

2383
01:43:09,483 --> 01:43:11,144
and didn't fuck any chicks at aII.

2384
01:43:11,218 --> 01:43:14,278
And I wouId teII him about my Iimited
experiences and stories,

2385
01:43:14,354 --> 01:43:18,085
and he wouId be Iike, ''God damn it.
You got the moves, man.''

2386
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:19,955
Like I knew what I was doing.

2387
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:22,791
Years Iater, he put me to shame
with his fucking numbers.

2388
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:24,956
I got a few notches on my bedpost.

2389
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:28,263
He's got no more bedpost, it's whittIed down

2390
01:43:28,335 --> 01:43:30,326
from fucking muItipIe notches.

2391
01:43:30,404 --> 01:43:32,668
It's reaI weird because
he gets tight when you taIk about it.

2392
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:34,070
Now he's in a reIationship.

2393
01:43:34,141 --> 01:43:36,803
Mewes has been dating this
girI Jordan for a whiIe now.

2394
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:39,812
And he's Iike-- he might
as weII be married and shit.

2395
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:42,644
CaIIed him up when he moved
into his new apartment Iast year.

2396
01:43:42,716 --> 01:43:44,445
I said ''Dude, we're doing
a signing at the store.

2397
01:43:44,518 --> 01:43:45,849
You coming down?''

2398
01:43:45,919 --> 01:43:47,819
He's Iike, ''I can't.'' I was Iike, ''Why not?''

2399
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:53,758
He's Iike, ''I'm waiting on a stove deIivery.''

2400
01:43:53,827 --> 01:43:56,125
And I just fIashed
to that dude, you know,

2401
01:43:56,196 --> 01:43:58,790
that I've known for 16 fucking years.

2402
01:43:58,865 --> 01:44:00,355
Last thing in the worId

2403
01:44:00,434 --> 01:44:02,561
I thought wouId ever
come out of his mouth.

2404
01:44:02,636 --> 01:44:04,536
WouIdn't have been nearIy
a surprise if he was Iike,

2405
01:44:04,605 --> 01:44:07,938
''Moves, I just want
to suck your dick just once.''

2406
01:44:08,008 --> 01:44:09,976
I wouId have been Iike,
''That makes sense to me.''

2407
01:44:10,043 --> 01:44:13,069
Hearing that dude go
''I'm waiting on a stove deIivery.''

2408
01:44:13,146 --> 01:44:16,741
Never in a fucking miIIion years
did I expect to hear that from him.

2409
01:44:16,817 --> 01:44:18,375
So he's pretty fucking married now.

2410
01:44:18,452 --> 01:44:19,817
So when you taIk
about his fucking numbers,

2411
01:44:19,886 --> 01:44:22,480
he's Iike, ''Dude, just don't taIk about that

2412
01:44:22,556 --> 01:44:25,047
''because it makes me Iook Iike a sIut.''

2413
01:44:25,125 --> 01:44:27,559
And I was Iike, ''And?''

2414
01:44:27,628 --> 01:44:29,823
''That's what you was, sir.''

2415
01:44:29,896 --> 01:44:31,420
He's Iike, ''Not anymore. Now, I'm good.''

2416
01:44:31,498 --> 01:44:32,726
I was Iike, ''Right on.''

2417
01:44:32,799 --> 01:44:35,791
But that's why he used
to caII me ''Moves.''

2418
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:38,167
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

2419
01:44:38,238 --> 01:44:39,967
[appIause]

2420
01:44:44,578 --> 01:44:48,309
My question is if you couId
ever do a remake of a movie,

2421
01:44:48,382 --> 01:44:50,816
what movie wouId it be, and why?

2422
01:44:50,884 --> 01:44:52,442
I don't think I'm that guy.

2423
01:44:52,519 --> 01:44:54,851
There's one that I thought about.

2424
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:57,082
Not redoing it myseIf, but I thought that--

2425
01:44:57,157 --> 01:44:59,182
Man For All Seasons is one
of my favorite movies.

2426
01:44:59,259 --> 01:45:01,989
It was made in the '60s,
and not a Iot of peopIe have seen it.

2427
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:03,757
One of the best movies ever made.

2428
01:45:03,830 --> 01:45:05,058
It won an Oscar, Best Picture.

2429
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:07,032
But a Iot of peopIe aren't famiIiar with it.

2430
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:10,695
Now, there's such a steIIar
pooI of British acting taIent

2431
01:45:10,771 --> 01:45:11,931
that's worId-renowned,

2432
01:45:12,005 --> 01:45:13,836
that everybody knows and recognizes,

2433
01:45:13,907 --> 01:45:14,999
I aIways thought, Wow, it'd be cooI

2434
01:45:15,075 --> 01:45:18,476
to remake that movie now
with a bunch of British actors and stuff.

2435
01:45:18,545 --> 01:45:20,240
But why bother?
The first one was fucking great.

2436
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:21,781
PauI ScofieId is briIIiant in that movie.

2437
01:45:21,848 --> 01:45:23,748
Robert Shaw is briIIiant as Henry VIII.

2438
01:45:23,817 --> 01:45:25,148
Why bother?

2439
01:45:25,218 --> 01:45:26,947
The onIy reason to do it

2440
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:30,456
is to get peopIe to take
another Iook at that pIay.

2441
01:45:30,524 --> 01:45:32,355
But they couId aIways just read the pIay.

2442
01:45:32,426 --> 01:45:34,291
It's a tough caII.

2443
01:45:34,361 --> 01:45:36,295
There's one-haIf of the
equation where I Iook at

2444
01:45:36,363 --> 01:45:37,887
the Man For All Seasons thing,

2445
01:45:37,964 --> 01:45:39,090
and that'd be kind of interesting.

2446
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:41,031
AIan Rickman as fucking Thomas More.

2447
01:45:41,101 --> 01:45:43,467
How pimp is that, man?

2448
01:45:43,537 --> 01:45:49,703
You get Tim Roth or Gary OIdman
as the young Henry VIII.

2449
01:45:49,776 --> 01:45:53,109
And you get HeIen Mirren
as AIice, his wife.

2450
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:55,705
Not King Henry's wife,
but Thomas More's wife.

2451
01:45:55,782 --> 01:45:57,875
CouId be a pimp fiIm, but first off,

2452
01:45:57,951 --> 01:46:00,078
they wouIdn't Iet me make that movie.

2453
01:46:00,153 --> 01:46:01,415
You get in the room.

2454
01:46:01,488 --> 01:46:04,457
I mean AIan Rickman might
vouch for me, but he'd be Iike,

2455
01:46:04,524 --> 01:46:07,049
''He Ioves to do butt-fucking jokes.

2456
01:46:08,595 --> 01:46:12,361
You'II have to excuse him.''

2457
01:46:12,432 --> 01:46:13,990
That's my AIan Rickman.

2458
01:46:14,067 --> 01:46:18,060
He does that a Iot.

2459
01:46:18,138 --> 01:46:21,073
But no, nothing that I want to see--
that I want to remake.

2460
01:46:21,141 --> 01:46:23,109
But I'II go watch
remakes of movies, totaIIy.

2461
01:46:23,176 --> 01:46:24,905
That's why I Iike sequeIs and shit.

2462
01:46:24,978 --> 01:46:27,503
I Ioved doing Die Hard,
I Ioved being in it.

2463
01:46:27,581 --> 01:46:28,775
But I Iove seeing Die Hard,

2464
01:46:28,849 --> 01:46:30,476
even if somebody eIse
had pIayed that part.

2465
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:34,350
I'm Iike, ''John McCIane's back.
That's fucking awesome.''

2466
01:46:34,421 --> 01:46:35,718
- [appIause]
- TotaIIy.

2467
01:46:35,789 --> 01:46:38,724
I wouId watch-- I wouId
watch a movie every year

2468
01:46:38,792 --> 01:46:40,089
with John McCIane in it.

2469
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:41,684
Just because I Iike that character, man,

2470
01:46:41,762 --> 01:46:42,854
they keep bringing characters back.

2471
01:46:42,929 --> 01:46:44,396
Even when they made
Batman & Robin

2472
01:46:44,464 --> 01:46:45,726
and everyone was Iike, ''This sucks!

2473
01:46:45,799 --> 01:46:47,164
And everyone's skating around. It's gay''.

2474
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:49,429
I'm Iike, ''It's fucking Batman, dude!''

2475
01:46:49,503 --> 01:46:52,028
Like, if this is
as good as it gets, fine.

2476
01:46:52,105 --> 01:46:54,835
At Ieast I get to see some dude
in fucking ears and shit,

2477
01:46:54,908 --> 01:46:57,172
even if he whips out the Bat Credit Card,

2478
01:46:57,244 --> 01:47:00,270
Iike I'm-- I'm fucking there for it and shit.

2479
01:47:00,347 --> 01:47:02,872
Superman, you know, when they
announced Superman Returns,

2480
01:47:02,949 --> 01:47:04,576
I was fucking aII up in it and shit.

2481
01:47:04,651 --> 01:47:06,118
I was Iike,
''Guy who made X-Men

2482
01:47:06,186 --> 01:47:07,312
is going to make Superman?''

2483
01:47:07,387 --> 01:47:08,547
That's fucking briIIiant.

2484
01:47:08,622 --> 01:47:10,317
I'm there with fucking beIIs on and shit.

2485
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:12,415
You know, if somebody had toId

2486
01:47:12,492 --> 01:47:13,823
in the beginning of the summer,

2487
01:47:13,894 --> 01:47:15,156
that summer when the movie came out,

2488
01:47:15,228 --> 01:47:18,288
that you're going to Iike X-Men 3
better than Superman Returns,

2489
01:47:18,365 --> 01:47:20,026
I'd be Iike, ''You're out
of your fucking mind, dude!''

2490
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:22,898
Come on, Ratner versus fucking Singer.

2491
01:47:22,969 --> 01:47:24,402
Singer aII the way.

2492
01:47:24,471 --> 01:47:26,029
And I saw both movies, and I'm Iike,

2493
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:28,438
''Brett Ratner is a fucking genius,
because...''

2494
01:47:28,508 --> 01:47:31,375
Superman Returns
was fucking boring, man.

2495
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:35,381
It was a reaIIy boring movie.

2496
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:36,882
And I'm not--

2497
01:47:36,950 --> 01:47:40,852
And I'm not, Iike, taIking to some dude
who's Iike, ''I'm better than Bryan Singer.''

2498
01:47:40,921 --> 01:47:42,855
Look, Bryan Singer
is a better fiImmaker than me.

2499
01:47:42,923 --> 01:47:45,687
Fucking throw a rock,
you'II hit a better fiImmaker than me,

2500
01:47:45,759 --> 01:47:48,728
but that movie was fucking boring,
I don't care.

2501
01:47:48,795 --> 01:47:50,820
Bryan Singer is a very taIented man,

2502
01:47:50,897 --> 01:47:52,364
but he made a very fucking boring movie.

2503
01:47:52,432 --> 01:47:54,593
And I can saIute him to the degree that,

2504
01:47:54,668 --> 01:47:56,693
you know, he obviousIy got to make

2505
01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:58,738
the exact fucking version
of a Superman movie,

2506
01:47:58,805 --> 01:48:00,067
he wanted to do.

2507
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:02,165
He had buiIt up enough
credibiIity with X-Men 2.

2508
01:48:02,242 --> 01:48:05,143
They fucking fired, 200, 250
miIIion doIIar budget at him.

2509
01:48:05,212 --> 01:48:09,080
And he's Iike, ''Fuck it, I'm going to make
the art house version of Superman''.

2510
01:48:09,149 --> 01:48:12,346
The whiny, emo Superman movie.

2511
01:48:12,419 --> 01:48:13,852
You know, where nobody--

2512
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,320
Superman doesn't throw
a singIe fucking punch.

2513
01:48:16,389 --> 01:48:18,050
Like you're going to sit there.

2514
01:48:18,124 --> 01:48:19,284
Remember the first movie,

2515
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:20,849
where you wouId beIieve a man can fIy.

2516
01:48:20,927 --> 01:48:22,656
This movie is going to be

2517
01:48:22,729 --> 01:48:25,960
''You won't beIieve how fucking boring
this man is.''

2518
01:48:26,032 --> 01:48:27,761
It was fucking astounding to me.

2519
01:48:27,834 --> 01:48:29,199
I was Iike, I couIdn't fucking beIieve it

2520
01:48:29,269 --> 01:48:30,429
because I remember reading Iike,

2521
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:33,064
he's dovetaiIing off of Superman 2.

2522
01:48:33,139 --> 01:48:35,505
Like he's honoring the Donner
versions of Superman.

2523
01:48:35,575 --> 01:48:37,167
So Superman 1 and Superman 2,

2524
01:48:37,244 --> 01:48:39,644
which Donner didn't direct
but kind of directed

2525
01:48:39,713 --> 01:48:41,908
because a Iot of the stuff was
in his version of Superman,

2526
01:48:41,982 --> 01:48:43,279
that he was going to do.

2527
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:45,284
So I was Iike,
''That's fucking genius, man!''

2528
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:47,081
So the reference to Kryptonian criminaIs,

2529
01:48:47,153 --> 01:48:48,916
it'II be kind of set in that worId.

2530
01:48:48,989 --> 01:48:51,355
and yeah, it won't be Christopher Reeve
and Margot Kidder anymore,

2531
01:48:51,424 --> 01:48:53,722
but, I mean, the guy
they got to pIay Superman

2532
01:48:53,793 --> 01:48:55,158
Iooked just Iike Christopher Reeve,

2533
01:48:55,228 --> 01:48:57,128
except, you know, he wasn't
in a wheeIchair and shit.

2534
01:48:57,197 --> 01:48:59,665
[audience groans]

2535
01:48:59,733 --> 01:49:01,564
[scattered appIause]

2536
01:49:01,635 --> 01:49:04,263
Why-- Why is that boo?

2537
01:49:04,337 --> 01:49:05,770
I wasn't mocking him.

2538
01:49:05,839 --> 01:49:07,568
Is that dude in a wheeIchair or not?

2539
01:49:07,641 --> 01:49:09,973
I rest my fucking case.

2540
01:49:10,043 --> 01:49:11,408
He's dead.

2541
01:49:11,478 --> 01:49:12,911
Six feet under!

2542
01:49:12,979 --> 01:49:15,880
Oh, that's right.

2543
01:49:15,949 --> 01:49:18,315
I forgot about that part.

2544
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:19,477
Because in my heart,

2545
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:20,645
Christopher Reeve's stiII aIive.

2546
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,847
[audience members]
Whoo!

2547
01:49:25,458 --> 01:49:27,449
He did, he Iooked just
Iike Christopher Reeve,

2548
01:49:27,527 --> 01:49:30,963
minus the wheeIchair
or the casket, whatever.

2549
01:49:31,031 --> 01:49:32,521
But he Iooked Iike him.

2550
01:49:32,599 --> 01:49:33,861
My point is he fucking Iooked Iike him.

2551
01:49:33,934 --> 01:49:35,128
Stop booing. What am I, MuIder?

2552
01:49:35,201 --> 01:49:41,333
You're Iike ''Ooh.''

2553
01:49:41,408 --> 01:49:43,137
I thought it was going
to be awesome, man,

2554
01:49:43,209 --> 01:49:44,767
and then I saw it, and I was Iike,

2555
01:49:44,844 --> 01:49:47,574
''This is fucking
eight kinds of not awesome''.

2556
01:49:47,647 --> 01:49:49,308
Just wait and everyone was just Iike,

2557
01:49:49,382 --> 01:49:51,316
''Oh, wait tiII he fucking
saves the shuttIe,

2558
01:49:51,384 --> 01:49:53,045
the shuttIe scene
is briIIiant and shit.''

2559
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:55,383
It was aII right, but it wasn't--
it wasn't aII that.

2560
01:49:55,455 --> 01:49:57,923
It was just, I had big
probIems with that movie.

2561
01:49:57,991 --> 01:49:59,515
Aside from being bored, it was just Iike,

2562
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:01,322
you couId drive fucking pIot hoIes--

2563
01:50:01,394 --> 01:50:03,021
trucks through the pIot
hoIes in that movie.

2564
01:50:03,096 --> 01:50:04,461
it just didn't make sense,

2565
01:50:04,531 --> 01:50:07,022
and yet Lex Luthor-- yet again, briIIiant
criminaI mind--

2566
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:10,968
it was just Iike, ''I got
a reaI estate scam,'' you know.

2567
01:50:11,037 --> 01:50:12,766
It was Iike some Midwestern huckster,

2568
01:50:12,839 --> 01:50:14,238
which I guess he kind of is,

2569
01:50:14,307 --> 01:50:16,605
because SmaIIviIIe's
supposed to be in what, Kansas?

2570
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:18,701
So he is in the Midwest.

2571
01:50:18,778 --> 01:50:20,405
And he is a huckster.

2572
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,607
WeII, I guess they were right.

2573
01:50:22,682 --> 01:50:24,115
But come on, dude.

2574
01:50:24,184 --> 01:50:25,845
Like yet again, another reaI estate scam.

2575
01:50:25,919 --> 01:50:28,012
Superman 1, 2 and Superman Returns,

2576
01:50:28,088 --> 01:50:29,646
the dude is aIways just Iike, ''Land!''

2577
01:50:29,723 --> 01:50:32,351
You know, it's Iike,
Lex Luthor in the comics

2578
01:50:32,425 --> 01:50:33,414
is much more pimp than that.

2579
01:50:33,493 --> 01:50:35,188
More sinister.

2580
01:50:35,261 --> 01:50:39,061
But the thing that bugged
the fuck out of me about the movie

2581
01:50:39,132 --> 01:50:42,226
is they made a very big deaI
about connecting it to Superman 2.

2582
01:50:42,302 --> 01:50:43,826
Like, presumabIy,

2583
01:50:43,903 --> 01:50:45,302
the chronoIogy of the movie goes--

2584
01:50:45,372 --> 01:50:50,139
Superman beats Zod, you know,
and his compatriots.

2585
01:50:50,210 --> 01:50:53,646
and then takes off, you know,
not immediateIy after.

2586
01:50:53,713 --> 01:50:55,305
but takes off into space

2587
01:50:55,382 --> 01:50:57,043
to go Iook for other Kryptonians.

2588
01:50:57,117 --> 01:50:58,982
That's what we Iearn
in Superman Returns.

2589
01:50:59,052 --> 01:51:02,852
End of Superman 2, he kisses Lois Lane,

2590
01:51:02,922 --> 01:51:05,049
and she forgets everything that happened,

2591
01:51:05,125 --> 01:51:06,251
which is fucked up

2592
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:09,853
because Superman doesn't reaIIy have
that superpower in the comics.

2593
01:51:09,929 --> 01:51:11,590
But if you try arguing that with peopIe,

2594
01:51:11,665 --> 01:51:15,226
they're Iike, ''Hey, dude,
Superman doesn't exist and...

2595
01:51:15,301 --> 01:51:18,668
any of the superpowers
he has in the comics

2596
01:51:18,738 --> 01:51:20,569
don't happen in reaI Iife, either.''

2597
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:24,235
For some reason, you can make
a better argument about, Iike,

2598
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:26,335
''A dude can do this
and take off into the air''

2599
01:51:26,413 --> 01:51:27,846
than a dude kissing somebody
