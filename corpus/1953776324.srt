1
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:06,109
Whoa! Daddy, this is awesome,
the way you made Fafnir...

2
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:08,121
You can tell it's him.

3
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:12,160
You can see how he didn't
used to be a dragon here,

4
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:14,927
and how he's turning into a dragon.

5
00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:19,967
Like this part of him.
And he has a big arm just like in the story, Daddy.

6
00:01:20,002 --> 00:01:21,935
And he has his... his what?

7
00:01:22,236 --> 00:01:23,936
His what?

8
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:28,976
You know his helmet thing again.
What do you call his helmet thing again?

9
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:32,707
Uh, wasn't it the helmet...

10
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:37,752
Helmet of Terror or something like that?

11
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:39,886
No, the funny word.

12
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:40,922
Oh, the funny word, huh?

13
00:01:40,957 --> 00:01:42,014
Pa, what was it?

14
00:01:42,256 --> 00:01:43,689
A Egishj疝mr.

15
00:01:44,926 --> 00:01:46,990
Well there you go.

16
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:49,055
A Egishj疝mr...

17
00:01:50,098 --> 00:01:53,067
And this thing, what's this thing?

18
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:54,301
This thing?

19
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:55,202
Yeah.

20
00:01:55,837 --> 00:01:56,895
What's this thing?

21
00:01:57,705 --> 00:01:58,805
Yes. Tell me.

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,867
You want me to tell you what this thing is?

23
00:02:02,944 --> 00:02:04,912
Yes, tell him what it is.

24
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:10,785
You already forget the best part of the story?
What happened to his heart...

25
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,789
Oh yeah oh yeah, when
he's lying on the ground like in the ditch,

26
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:17,893
and then, boom! Right through his heart!

27
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:20,962
It's his heart, okay, it's his heart.

28
00:02:20,997 --> 00:02:22,224
Something like that.

29
00:02:22,864 --> 00:02:26,664
Boom! You did good with Fafnir,
Daddy. You did good.

30
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:33,673
You did good, Daddy.

31
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:37,667
Uh, why do we know so much about dragons?

32
00:03:23,124 --> 00:03:24,826
But he can't do anything.

33
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:25,658
Chip.

34
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:29,697
Well, he can't. Mr. Murrow is fat. Really.

35
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:34,657
He's fat and he talks really slow.

36
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:43,711
What? He needs another job.
Even Mrs. Adams would be a better P.E. teacher.

37
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:44,939
Now, Chip, come on.

38
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:47,671
What? She said so.

39
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:51,784
Wait a minute. Mrs. Adams said that?

40
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:57,007
Yeah. She used to play volleyball, she said.
So she can teach us something.

41
00:03:57,042 --> 00:04:02,196
She says Mr. Murrow just teaches kids
to get fat and he's doing a good job.

42
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:05,199
Chip. Mrs. Adams really said that?

43
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:06,032
Yeah.

44
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,133
At the store.

45
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:12,128
Yes, at the store, but Mrs. Adams said it.

46
00:04:13,174 --> 00:04:16,177
Mrs. Adams really said that
Mr. Murrow's teaching the kids to be fat?

47
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:19,271
No. She used the other word. It means fat too.

48
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:21,315
Overweight?

49
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,617
No.

50
00:04:22,652 --> 00:04:23,850
Obese?

51
00:04:23,885 --> 00:04:28,845
Yeah. She said, ''He's teaching them
to be obese and he's doing a good job...

52
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:35,828
at it, John.'' I don't know who John is,
but Mrs. Adams said it.

53
00:04:35,863 --> 00:04:40,067
Well, I don't want you going around repeating
what Mrs. Adams didn't mean for you to hear.

54
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:42,035
Okay, okay.

55
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,923
Why don't you give us reports
about Mr. Murrow every day?

56
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,776
Maybe we're forgetting some
of the good things he does.

57
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:50,038
He can't do anything.

58
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:58,019
I think I remember a couple of good days in there.
Some good kickball days, tee ball days.

59
00:04:58,054 --> 00:04:59,685
He can't do anything days.

60
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,689
Well, if he痴 really all that bad,
we'll do something about it.

61
00:05:03,724 --> 00:05:06,894
We've got connections to a
very powerful member of the PTA.

62
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:08,062
You mean that guy?

63
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:09,161
That guy right there.

64
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:11,213
He doesn't look very powerful.

65
00:05:11,248 --> 00:05:13,230
Oh but my hearing is powerful.

66
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:17,238
You got it, Mr. PTA?

67
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:18,205
On it.

68
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:21,941
I'm driving today!

69
00:05:21,976 --> 00:05:23,978
Better check out the first grade today.

70
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:25,897
Oh. Don't get too obese now.

71
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:27,781
Come on. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

72
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:33,786
Morning Betsy.

73
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:34,956
Good morning, Mr. Joey.

74
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:35,923
Yeah, Ed!

75
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,926
Yeah, I got his message, but I went ahead
and told Rick to come in anyway.

76
00:05:43,731 --> 00:05:46,097
Yeah. I figure it'll give you an extra man
and a little less traffic today, yeah?

77
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:51,102
So forgive me for last week?

78
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:56,639
No, today it's just the great room architecturals.

79
00:05:57,812 --> 00:05:58,801
You got it.

80
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:03,984
Betsy, have you seen...

81
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:05,286
He's right behind you Miss.

82
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:06,687
Morning Marge.

83
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:07,653
Oh, Joey.

84
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:08,888
Everything okay?

85
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:10,990
I知 not so sure about these.

86
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:16,228
Okay. Now these are the shutters.
Do you have the other page?

87
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:20,267
There we go. Yeah, it probably makes sense
to look at these two at the same time.

88
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:25,237
Okay. Well, this morning
I woke up and I was in a panic.

89
00:06:25,272 --> 00:06:29,231
This looks nothing like last week.
These aren't new, are they?

90
00:06:30,277 --> 00:06:33,246
No, these are from last week.

91
00:06:33,948 --> 00:06:38,918
Am I crazy? I知 not crazy.
Joey, there's something wrong.

92
00:06:38,953 --> 00:06:42,156
Well, it's not a problem.
We've still got a little time before they do all the cutting.

93
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:44,025
So we'll make sure they
cut you something you like, okay?

94
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,595
Joey. This is Sharon. The glazier.

95
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,095
Right. Sharon, good to meet you.

96
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,132
Now you only got till noon today, right?

97
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:52,098
That's right.

98
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:53,901
Great. Marge, if you don't mind,
I知 gonna get Sharon...

99
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:55,134
I didn't know Ed was here.

100
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:57,136
Yeah, we're letting them
play out in the sun today.

101
00:06:57,171 --> 00:07:01,175
So, Marge, if you'll excuse me for about 15 minutes,
I知 going to get Sharon started here and...

102
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,142
Oh! But you know what?

103
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:08,114
What would be really helpful is if you could look at these,
which we know you don't like. And you've got that book.

104
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:11,217
Hold on a sec. Sorry Sharon, I'll be right back.

105
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:16,857
I知 sorry Sharon, what is it you do?

106
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:18,791
I知 the glass cutter, ma'am.

107
00:07:19,593 --> 00:07:23,831
Oh. You cut glass.

108
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:25,128
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:30,803
So you've got this book that
should be good for some ideas.

110
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:34,842
So, look through the book and write down
any page numbers that look interesting.

111
00:07:34,877 --> 00:07:36,944
That you like better than the drawings,
then we'll take it from there.

112
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:37,910
Sound good?

113
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:39,912
Okay, but what about Sam?

114
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:42,581
Don't worry, we're not about to do
anything without Sam knowing.

115
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:46,120
This is just to get us started, see if we can
figure out what exactly isn't working for you.

116
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:47,955
Then we'll get Sam in here to help us along.

117
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,599
Alright?

118
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:48,921
Alright.

119
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:51,458
Great. Thanks Marge.
Uh, so Sharon, let's go this way.

120
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:53,961
Now you know Bob from
that Leighton House job, right?

121
00:07:53,996 --> 00:07:55,223
Yeah. That was great.

122
00:07:56,263 --> 00:07:59,755
Brent, would you put up our next problem,
please? Julie, you're on deck.

123
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:19,253
Class, we see a problem like this,
and our job is to...

124
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:20,786
Simplify.

125
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:21,787
Very good. Thank you, Brent.

126
00:08:21,822 --> 00:08:25,826
Julie, would you draw an arrow
to where we should start to simplify.

127
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:27,225
Dennis, you're on deck.

128
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:37,004
Great. So, it looks like Julie
started inside the absolute values.

129
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,274
Inside the absolute values
there are how many operations? Tim?

130
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,240
Two operations.

131
00:08:41,275 --> 00:08:42,742
Very good. Two operations.

132
00:08:42,943 --> 00:08:46,080
And Julie started with which operation? Erin?

133
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:47,165
Multiplication.

134
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,215
Multiplication.

135
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,253
So Julie started inside the absolute values
where there are two operations,

136
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:55,222
and she started with the multiplication operation.
Class, do we agree?

137
00:08:55,823 --> 00:08:57,222
Great. Thank you.

138
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,621
Dennis, would you use Julie's work to show me
how we can simplify yet again?

139
00:09:02,663 --> 00:09:03,925
Cet, you're on deck.

140
00:09:21,115 --> 00:09:26,883
Hey. Aren't you forgetting something?
About today?

141
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:34,195
Blake. Get in here. We forgot about Jamie's...

142
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,162
Oh yeah, oh yeah!

143
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:40,701
Hey, Uncle Cody.

144
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:41,668
Hey, Blake.

145
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:46,164
Alright. Go.

146
00:10:02,189 --> 00:10:04,180
Pa, can we get this one?

147
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:24,743
Jamie!

148
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:25,676
Happy Birthday!

149
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,648
Hey there. Double duty today, huh?

150
00:10:29,683 --> 00:10:32,816
Yeah, Dave and Eileen'll be
by later to pick up Blake.

151
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:35,949
Carol! Come on in, come in.
Jamie, look who's here.

152
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:37,957
But, is Joey coming?

153
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:39,960
Yeah, he should be here in a bit.

154
00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:41,962
Hold on, hold on...

155
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:46,065
Scratch that. No, he's not going to make it.

156
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:52,100
Come on now, Joey, you are not
leaving me alone with all these kids now.

157
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:56,042
Chip, where are you? Come here.

158
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:58,512
Daddy's stuck at work again.

159
00:10:58,547 --> 00:11:00,145
Stuck with the Hawk Lady.

160
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,950
Yeah, stuck with the Hawk Lady.
Want to go by there after this?

161
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:04,952
Yeah. And we'll bring him some cake.

162
00:11:04,987 --> 00:11:05,918
Alright, I値l let him know.

163
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:08,689
No, not about the cake. It'll be a surprise.

164
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:09,656
Alright.

165
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:37,073
That one.

166
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:39,909
Which one? That one?

167
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:41,676
Yeah.

168
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:42,950
Okay. Can you read the name on it?

169
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:44,085
Paiste. Paiste.

170
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,153
That's pretty good.

171
00:12:45,188 --> 00:12:46,454
And that one too.

172
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:47,686
Okay that one too.

173
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:49,890
You want to print them both out or just the one?

174
00:12:49,925 --> 00:12:50,892
Both.

175
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:51,824
Okay.

176
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:52,976
And can we find the stories?

177
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,059
No, let's do that tomorrow.

178
00:12:54,094 --> 00:12:57,965
It痴 getting late. Yes, it's getting late.
We've got all week to find the stories.

179
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,932
Yessir. Sounds like you're getting tired.

180
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:04,972
No? So it's not time for bed?
I believe it's time for bed.

181
00:13:05,007 --> 00:13:06,407
Time for bed, Chipmunk.

182
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:07,773
No. Don't call me that!

183
00:13:07,808 --> 00:13:11,209
What, Chipmunk? You're telling me you don't
like being called Chipmunk, Chipmunk?

184
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:14,007
And Daddy keeps calling me...

185
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:20,054
That's 'cause he knows you love it.
You know, I know what else you love.

186
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:22,784
Are you trying to get away from me? Huh?

187
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:28,128
You love when I do this.
It痴 time for bed, Chipmunk.

188
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:31,765
It痴 time for bed!
Nothing you can do about it.

189
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,867
I don't need two of you.

190
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:33,934
You've got two of us.

191
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:35,901
Someone help me!

192
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:37,237
No one can help you. It痴 too late for you.

193
00:13:37,272 --> 00:13:39,637
You're done! You're done!

194
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:07,660
Hey.

195
00:15:08,095 --> 00:15:11,064
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

196
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:15,201
Long day, huh?

197
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:18,071
Looong day.

198
00:15:21,108 --> 00:15:24,077
Anne's pretending to be mad
at you for missing her party.

199
00:15:25,746 --> 00:15:27,077
Anne.

200
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:33,080
Chip's pretending to be
mad at me for acting like you.

201
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:35,088
Chip.

202
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:41,060
You remember who has
training early tomorrow?

203
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:44,062
You do.

204
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:46,065
So who has to take Chip to school?

205
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,067
I do.

206
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:54,107
You forgot, didn't you?

207
00:15:54,142 --> 00:15:55,574
I did.

208
00:15:57,611 --> 00:16:00,580
Any wonder I fell for such a smooth talker?

209
00:16:26,607 --> 00:16:31,567
Hello? Hey Eileen. You're where?

210
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:34,581
What...?

211
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:36,776
But what...?

212
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:40,787
Is he... Eileen, is he...?

213
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:48,784
Okay, yeah, I got it. I値l be right there.
Yeah, we'll be right there.

214
00:16:50,964 --> 00:16:52,165
Hey, buddy, we got to go.

215
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,098
But I知 not done.

216
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:54,701
Sorry, we got to go now.

217
00:16:54,736 --> 00:16:55,901
But my shoes...

218
00:16:55,936 --> 00:16:58,905
I got 'em. You can put them on in the car.
Let's go. Let's go.

219
00:17:04,711 --> 00:17:06,845
Dave, what's going on? Is he okay?

220
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,218
Yeah. They started the surgery a little while ago and
they said they'd let us know if anything happens, so...

221
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:13,620
What happened, Dave?
Do you know what happened to him?

222
00:17:13,655 --> 00:17:15,940
I don't know. They talked mostly to Eileen.

223
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:18,225
She just told me the part about the surgery.

224
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,791
Okay. Who did Eileen talk with?

225
00:17:19,826 --> 00:17:22,195
Nurse's name was Rachel
something. I知 not sure...

226
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,795
Are they talking now?

227
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,832
But Eileen also talked to the
doctor for a few minutes.

228
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:26,798
Okay, are they talking now? They're...

229
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,836
No, no, doctor's in surgery now.
And Eileen actually had to go home.

230
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:31,929
Okay. Is that the nurse you were talking to?

231
00:17:32,072 --> 00:17:36,942
No. I知 sorry. I don't see her, Joey, I知 sorry.

232
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:41,148
No, that's fine. I値l figure out where she is,
what's going on. Do you remember the doctor's name?

233
00:17:41,183 --> 00:17:43,250
It was doctor... yeah, it was Doctor Sills.

234
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:46,885
Okay, great. I知 just gonna go...

235
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,050
Chip, Daddy's going to go talk to that nurse over there,
okay? You want to come with me or stay here with Uncle Dave?

236
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:52,891
Come with you.

237
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:55,895
Alright, let's go, buddy. Let's go.

238
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:05,671
Can I help you?

239
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:07,639
Yes. I知 Joey Williams.

240
00:18:07,674 --> 00:18:09,943
I知 waiting here with Dave, and...

241
00:18:09,978 --> 00:18:10,910
I知 sorry Dave...?

242
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:15,015
Yeah, Dave Robey over there. We're family of Cody Hines.

243
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,642
He, he was in a car accident.

244
00:18:16,883 --> 00:18:17,907
Yesss...

245
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:21,687
And another nurse, a Rachel someone,
I think, said he was in surgery.

246
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:25,692
Yes, now I have an Eileen Robey and David Robey
listed as sister and brother-in-law.

247
00:18:25,727 --> 00:18:26,658
Right.

248
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:27,926
Okay. And I知 sorry, you are...?

249
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:31,965
Joey Williams. We live together.
This is our kid Chip, Chip Hines.

250
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,931
Okay.

251
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:36,935
Joey's still doing okay-
Cody's still doing okay, right? Stable?

252
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,641
Eileen told me he was stable, but that was a
little while ago. Do you know what's happening now?

253
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:43,643
Nurse Edwards will talk to you about that.

254
00:18:43,678 --> 00:18:47,647
Okay. Okay, I haven't met her yet.

255
00:18:47,682 --> 00:18:48,648
Is that Rachel Edwards?

256
00:18:48,683 --> 00:18:49,614
Yes.

257
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:51,785
Okay, can you tell me where I can find her?

258
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,047
I値l let her know to talk to you.

259
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:57,657
Okay. Alright, I値l be right over there with Dave.

260
00:18:57,692 --> 00:18:58,624
I値l let her know.

261
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:02,627
And she knows what's going on with Cody, right?

262
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,698
Because I don't really know anything.

263
00:19:05,966 --> 00:19:08,901
I don't know how bad it was or
what they're trying to fix now, or anything.

264
00:19:10,837 --> 00:19:12,099
Nurse Edwards will talk to you about all that.

265
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:15,635
Or the doctor, can I talk to him now?

266
00:19:15,842 --> 00:19:17,070
Not right now.

267
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:21,945
Right. Okay. Thanks.

268
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:33,957
And, sorry, if you need me
for anything, let me know.

269
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:37,122
Could you tell Nurse Edwards that?
That if she needs anything I知 over there.

270
00:19:38,832 --> 00:19:40,700
Like if she has questions about Cody or something.

271
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:41,826
Okay.

272
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:44,137
Alright. And she'll be back soon?

273
00:19:44,172 --> 00:19:44,967
Any minute.

274
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:47,273
Okay.

275
00:19:58,285 --> 00:19:59,877
You okay, buddy?

276
00:20:01,955 --> 00:20:05,083
Good. We're going to be okay.

277
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:12,460
They didn't tell you what happened?
What they're trying to do?

278
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:16,091
No, they talked to Eileen about that,
I didn't get much of it.

279
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,208
Hey, Chip, Daddy's going to make a call, okay?

280
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:48,235
Hey Eileen, it's Joey. It痴 about 9:30 now.

281
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,669
I知 here at the hospital with Dave.

282
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:53,673
I was hoping you knew what happened exactly.

283
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,768
I guess the nurse, Nurse Edwards is supposed
to come talk to us, but I haven't seen her yet.

284
00:20:58,812 --> 00:21:00,803
Hey, Dave, Sally knows right?

285
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:03,817
Yeah, I知 going to go pick her up at noon.

286
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:04,784
Okay.

287
00:21:05,252 --> 00:21:09,689
Yeah, so call me back when you get this
and I値l let you know what's going on.

288
00:21:10,123 --> 00:21:13,615
Or you can let me know what's going on. Bye.

289
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:18,688
Did you call your work?

290
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:21,257
Oh, no no. I should.

291
00:21:22,936 --> 00:21:25,121
Mr. Robey, we called this
number that your wife gave us...

292
00:21:25,156 --> 00:21:27,307
Hi, are you Nurse Edwards?
You are. Great. Is he okay?

293
00:21:27,342 --> 00:21:28,273
Is he doing okay now?

294
00:21:28,308 --> 00:21:30,075
Wait, are you also here for Mr. Hines?

295
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,204
Yes, I知 Joey Williams. I live with him.
This is our kid Chip, Chip Hines.

296
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:36,249
Is he still in surgery?
Is he with the doctor in surgery?

297
00:21:36,284 --> 00:21:38,650
No no no. He hasn't gone into surgery yet.

298
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:44,157
Mr. Robey, your wife gave us this doctor's information, but when we
contacted his office, they didn't have any records for Mr. Hines.

299
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:45,476
No, that's not his doctor.

300
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:46,725
Do you have any idea...

301
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,988
That hasn't been his doctor for years.

302
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:56,969
This is his doctor now.

303
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:02,408
Are you sure?

304
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:04,110
Yeah. Definitely.

305
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,648
Okay. Okay, good.

306
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:10,982
Is there something else you need to know?

307
00:22:11,017 --> 00:22:16,022
About his medical history? He's allergic to penicillin
and he needs... do you want to write that down?

308
00:22:16,057 --> 00:22:17,990
Chip, your Dad'll be right back.

309
00:22:31,037 --> 00:22:32,138
Hi...

310
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:33,204
Hey baby.

311
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:38,578
So they finished the surgery about an hour ago.
They got started really late.

312
00:22:38,613 --> 00:22:41,846
I was here for hours before they started.

313
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:47,587
And it was harder than they thought.
The doctor explained a little bit more what happened.

314
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:49,555
It痴 awful, Eileen.

315
00:22:51,891 --> 00:22:55,850
It looks like, it looks like
Cody got pretty roughed up.

316
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:59,599
But they did a lot, so he's resting now.

317
00:22:59,634 --> 00:23:01,566
They said that they would...

318
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:05,560
they'd learn a lot from
how he does tonight. Okay?

319
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,802
Okay.

320
00:23:12,846 --> 00:23:13,847
I値l be right back.

321
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:14,814
Okay.

322
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,883
Hey Joey.

323
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:20,579
Oh, Eileen. Hey.

324
00:23:23,623 --> 00:23:24,889
I brought your stuff.

325
00:23:24,924 --> 00:23:27,893
Oh good. Thanks for picking it up.

326
00:23:28,928 --> 00:23:30,662
Are you sure you don't want
to go home and get some rest?

327
00:23:30,697 --> 00:23:33,894
No, tonight's important, they said.
So I知 gonna stick around.

328
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:38,270
Do you want Chip come home stay with us?

329
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:40,906
No, that's fine. He, he wants to stay.

330
00:23:44,644 --> 00:23:48,913
Mr. Robey, Mrs. Hines. If you'd like,
you can see Mr. Hines now.

331
00:23:48,948 --> 00:23:52,786
He's not conscious, but you can
sit with him for a few minutes if you like.

332
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:54,955
Yes. I'd like that, yes.

333
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,089
Good. This way, Mrs. Hines.

334
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:11,069
Oh, I知 sorry, Mr. Williams, only family members
allowed to visit at this time.

335
00:24:11,938 --> 00:24:16,943
Oh. So you mean I can't see him?
I mean, we are family, we...

336
00:24:16,978 --> 00:24:18,812
I知 sorry, Mr. Williams.

337
00:24:18,847 --> 00:24:20,045
No, Joey, is...

338
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,650
No, it's okay. Chip, go with Grandma Sally, okay?

339
00:24:23,685 --> 00:24:24,776
I don't want to go.

340
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:26,218
Chip!

341
00:24:28,254 --> 00:24:30,222
Hold on a sec.

342
00:24:37,297 --> 00:24:39,629
Hey Chipmunk.

343
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:42,635
Hey!

344
00:24:45,271 --> 00:24:49,640
I知 sorry. I didn't even ask.

345
00:24:50,677 --> 00:24:53,009
Yeah, I didn't even ask what you wanted to do.

346
00:24:55,048 --> 00:24:58,609
You don't have to go in there if you
don't want to, you know that, right?

347
00:24:59,052 --> 00:25:03,113
It痴 okay. It痴 okay.

348
00:25:11,664 --> 00:25:16,829
Pa got hurt, and it'll be hard
to see him like that, I know.

349
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:20,969
But you know what?

350
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:27,202
If it was me back there,
now I知 just trying to think like Pa now.

351
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:31,879
I think I壇 really like to have my Chip with me.

352
00:25:33,186 --> 00:25:36,121
Yeah? Yeah...

353
00:25:37,857 --> 00:25:40,155
That'd probably be more
important than just about anything else.

354
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:47,155
And my eyes may be closed,
and maybe I don't say a thing,

355
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:50,669
but I would know you were there.

356
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:54,673
And I壇 feel a whole lot better.

357
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:59,672
Even if I couldn't move a bit of me to show you,
I would feel a whole lot better.

358
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:02,647
I would know you were there.

359
00:26:02,949 --> 00:26:07,818
Everyone knows when
you're in the room, Chip. Yeah?

360
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:14,823
Now, Uncle Dave, you're
never sure if he痴 really all there.

361
00:26:15,862 --> 00:26:19,093
And I知 not sure Pa ever really
liked Auntie Eileen all that much.

362
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:22,969
So you gonna go save Pa
from Auntie Eileen? Yeah? Yeah?

363
00:26:23,004 --> 00:26:23,936
Okay, I値l go.

364
00:26:25,138 --> 00:26:26,671
Come on, Chip.

365
00:26:26,706 --> 00:26:27,934
Come on, Chip.
Why don't you go with your Grandma?

366
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,939
So we'll be right back, okay?

367
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:54,096
Hey, where'd you get that?

368
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:59,239
Since I知 in my PJs, everyone thinks I知 sick.
They'll give me anything.

369
00:26:59,274 --> 00:27:03,198
You want some? I値l give you one.
They'll give me anything.

370
00:27:03,676 --> 00:27:06,941
No, Chip. Chip.

371
00:27:10,116 --> 00:27:11,684
Did something happen?

372
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,651
No. No change.

373
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,788
Mr. Williams, I wanted to give you this.

374
00:27:16,823 --> 00:27:21,783
Please don't tell anyone I gave you this.
This is a Hospital Visitation Authorization.

375
00:27:21,995 --> 00:27:24,964
If you fill it out, in the
future you'll be able to visit him.

376
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:27,762
And he'll be able to visit you. Just in case.

377
00:27:30,103 --> 00:27:33,766
Wow. Thank you.

378
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:40,768
Yeah, I知 kind of a moron
when it comes to this stuff, so thank you.

379
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:42,814
I really appreciate it.

380
00:27:42,849 --> 00:27:43,815
Hopefully, you won't need it.

381
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,651
Like I said, just in case.
Please don't tell anybody, I could...

382
00:28:56,689 --> 00:28:59,658
Oh a song

383
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:04,931
came to the valley

384
00:29:04,966 --> 00:29:10,136
The valley of plenty

385
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:13,671
And you stayed

386
00:29:13,706 --> 00:29:18,676
And I learned every word

387
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:24,711
And now you are leaving the valley

388
00:29:24,752 --> 00:29:30,723
The valley so empty

389
00:29:30,758 --> 00:29:32,857
You are

390
00:29:32,892 --> 00:29:36,851
crossing the river

391
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,192
now

392
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:25,095
This is Gloria.

393
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:30,090
We never met, but I worked with Cody.

394
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,694
Hey Chipmunk. How was school?

395
00:39:03,729 --> 00:39:07,900
Who are you talking to, Daddy?
Is there a chipmunk back there?

396
00:39:07,935 --> 00:39:11,837
Is there a chipmunk in the car?
No, just a Chip, Daddy.

397
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,997
Alright. Settle down.

398
00:39:23,682 --> 00:39:25,781
I知 6, you know.

399
00:39:25,816 --> 00:39:27,881
Oh, don't I know it.

400
00:39:29,088 --> 00:39:30,077
Chip.

401
00:39:31,724 --> 00:39:34,887
School was looong.

402
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:39,064
Where are we going?

403
00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:40,899
Back to school.

404
00:40:09,662 --> 00:40:11,892
Gloria. Hey, I知 Joey.

405
00:40:12,931 --> 00:40:15,413
What do you know.
Finally get to meet face to face.

406
00:40:15,448 --> 00:40:17,895
Cody said a lot of really great things about you.

407
00:40:18,937 --> 00:40:23,067
Not like he needed to. It痴 like our
stomachs have known you for years.

408
00:40:23,909 --> 00:40:29,074
Oh, uh, here you go. Really sorry
it took so long to get these back to you.

409
00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:32,083
I have some lasagna.

410
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:35,209
Oh, you don't have to do that.

411
00:40:36,822 --> 00:40:39,814
Gloria, I didn't come by for a refill.

412
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:48,026
Gloria, you're too much.
Really, we can't just keep taking your food.

413
00:40:49,134 --> 00:40:54,171
Cody was a good one.
But he wasn't too good to eat my food,

414
00:40:54,206 --> 00:40:57,642
so don't you go thinking you're too good
to eat my food. You take the lasagna.

415
00:40:59,712 --> 00:41:02,112
Gloria, you're too much.

416
00:41:02,681 --> 00:41:06,117
And I値l take the lasagna.

417
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:08,978
Hey, have you met Chip?

418
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:12,189
Hey, Chip! Come here!

419
00:41:12,224 --> 00:41:14,055
Come say hello to Miss Gloria.

420
00:42:18,724 --> 00:42:20,191
Oh hey! Sorry about that.

421
00:42:21,226 --> 00:42:23,228
Hold on, sorry. I didn't see you there.

422
00:42:23,263 --> 00:42:24,229
Joey, this is my husband, Cody.

423
00:42:24,264 --> 00:42:25,164
Hey, how you doing?

424
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:26,130
Hey.

425
00:42:26,165 --> 00:42:29,168
With Gus gone,
Joey's going to finish the renovations.

426
00:42:29,203 --> 00:42:30,134
Okay, good.

427
00:42:30,169 --> 00:42:31,735
I知 just here till the end of the month.

428
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:34,807
Be nice to him. I知 trying
to convince him to stick around.

429
00:42:34,842 --> 00:42:36,774
Yeah, how's she doing? She convinced you?

430
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:40,779
Three contractors in three months,
and you're the best.

431
00:42:40,814 --> 00:42:43,714
Please, Joey, please stay!

432
00:42:45,184 --> 00:42:47,653
This seemed like a better idea from up there.

433
00:42:47,688 --> 00:42:49,655
We're not usually like this.

434
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:51,623
You're alright, yeah?

435
00:43:12,044 --> 00:43:13,909
Hey, Eileen, it's Joey.

436
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,918
Chip Hines, please come to the upstairs.

437
00:43:25,624 --> 00:43:26,675
Hi Joey.

438
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,691
Hey Dave.

439
00:43:27,726 --> 00:43:28,727
Eileen's in the kitchen.

440
00:43:28,762 --> 00:43:29,694
Okay.

441
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:32,664
Hey Eileen.

442
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:33,631
Joey.

443
00:43:35,734 --> 00:43:36,668
You want a drink or something?

444
00:43:36,703 --> 00:43:38,863
No, I知 okay. Thanks.

445
00:43:39,972 --> 00:43:43,100
I am just a little out of my league
with all these papers.

446
00:43:44,142 --> 00:43:48,203
I appreciate you letting me come over.
This was pretty much all Cody's department before.

447
00:43:50,249 --> 00:43:52,950
So, I知 pretty sure everything's getting paid.

448
00:43:52,985 --> 00:43:55,652
Definitely the big stuff like the mortgage.

449
00:43:56,255 --> 00:44:01,659
There's some smaller bills I don't get,
like this one from the bank, but I keep paying 'em.

450
00:44:04,696 --> 00:44:06,129
These are all his accounts with money.

451
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,068
This is from the teacher's credit union.

452
00:44:12,237 --> 00:44:15,798
So uh, you're not going to believe this.

453
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:17,804
I didn't find a will.

454
00:44:18,844 --> 00:44:22,007
Instead, there is this...

455
00:44:22,915 --> 00:44:25,008
this sort of fill-in-the-blank deal.

456
00:44:26,051 --> 00:44:27,143
Look at that.

457
00:44:28,186 --> 00:44:32,646
He got as far as his name. Isn't that hysterical?

458
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:38,023
I guess the mortgage must be tough
with just your money coming in.

459
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:43,089
Naw, it's not so bad. I make enough, you know.

460
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:48,103
Chip and I wouldn't even know how to live it up,
so we're doing fine.

461
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:55,070
I mean, I was scared at first too,
but it helped when...

462
00:44:59,051 --> 00:45:01,713
Oh, okay, look at this.

463
00:45:03,221 --> 00:45:07,055
So I found this budget Cody made.
It痴 a little old and all.

464
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,220
Hell, we probably talked about it
at some point, but I don't remember.

465
00:45:11,964 --> 00:45:17,231
I probably wasn't listening.
Well, I am listening now.

466
00:45:18,236 --> 00:45:20,227
We're happy to help with Chip.

467
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:27,679
Don't let him hear that. No, we're good, Eileen.
We're good. And we've got some money sa-

468
00:45:27,714 --> 00:45:28,805
Cody had a will.

469
00:45:29,815 --> 00:45:30,907
What?

470
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:36,144
This bill from the bank is for the box where
he kept his will and some other papers.

471
00:45:40,258 --> 00:45:41,927
How'd you figure that out, I couldn't-

472
00:45:41,962 --> 00:45:44,896
Cody told me. Years ago.

473
00:45:46,098 --> 00:45:49,800
Eileen. Why didn't you say something?

474
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:54,795
I thought you knew.
Joey, I知 sorry, I thought you knew.

475
00:45:55,107 --> 00:45:58,235
I didn't realize until you called that you didn't...

476
00:45:59,277 --> 00:46:05,238
Uh Cody... he named me the executor in his will.

477
00:46:09,688 --> 00:46:12,622
A friend of mine, she's been through this before,

478
00:46:12,657 --> 00:46:17,662
helped walk me through all the people to talk to
and how to get the accounts transferred.

479
00:46:17,697 --> 00:46:19,131
What? You transferred his accounts?

480
00:46:19,166 --> 00:46:20,621
I thought you knew, Joey.

481
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:26,905
I didn't say anything because I didn't want you
to have to think about all this,

482
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,873
not when you were dealing with everything else.

483
00:46:35,213 --> 00:46:39,818
What does this mean? Uh... do I need to
get that mortgage check back?

484
00:46:39,853 --> 00:46:41,019
Is it supposed to go somewhere else now?

485
00:46:41,054 --> 00:46:42,179
Yeah, you should get that back.

486
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:44,786
I値l take care of the mortgage now.

487
00:46:45,824 --> 00:46:47,657
Really, Eileen, I can afford it.

488
00:46:47,692 --> 00:46:50,293
Well Joey, the, the house is in my name now.

489
00:46:50,328 --> 00:46:54,025
So that means that there's
a mortgage in my name now too.

490
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,034
Cody left all his assets in my name,

491
00:46:57,069 --> 00:47:01,872
so that he could see that
Chip was taken care of... by me.

492
00:47:01,907 --> 00:47:04,740
But I知 telling you, I can take care of Chip.
There's no problem.

493
00:47:07,779 --> 00:47:09,948
You don't think I can take care of Chip?

494
00:47:09,983 --> 00:47:12,082
Joey, no. It痴 just, it's what Cody wanted.

495
00:47:12,117 --> 00:47:15,086
Oh and you can't be telling me Cody
thought I couldn't take care of Chip.

496
00:47:16,888 --> 00:47:22,087
Eileen, this is from 2002. Chip was just a baby.

497
00:47:23,028 --> 00:47:25,931
It痴 his will, Joey. I知 sorry, he never changed it.

498
00:47:25,966 --> 00:47:26,897
You can't think that he...

499
00:47:26,932 --> 00:47:29,264
He had 6 years to change it, and he didn't.

500
00:47:30,902 --> 00:47:36,902
It says ''Last Will And Testament.''
It痴, it's not fill-in-the-blank.

501
00:47:37,642 --> 00:47:39,075
He knew what he wanted.

502
00:47:40,979 --> 00:47:45,177
So you don't need to worry about the mortgage.
You can stay as long as you need.

503
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,552
And... you don't have to worry about Chip.

504
00:47:48,587 --> 00:47:50,722
Of course I need to worry about Chip, I知 his father.

505
00:47:50,757 --> 00:47:52,849
Joey, Chip is our responsibility now.

506
00:47:54,726 --> 00:47:56,853
Our legal responsibility.

507
00:47:57,896 --> 00:47:59,314
Cody named us as...

508
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:00,697
Stop pointing to 2002!

509
00:48:00,732 --> 00:48:02,063
It痴 what my brother wanted, Joey.

510
00:48:03,235 --> 00:48:08,070
Could you have a little respect for that?
Just a little respect?

511
00:48:08,607 --> 00:48:11,109
What is going on here, Eileen?
I don't get what's going on here.

512
00:48:11,144 --> 00:48:12,075
Cody wanted to make sure...

513
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:14,112
What is changing here? What is going on?

514
00:48:14,147 --> 00:48:15,113
We are his family and-

515
00:48:15,148 --> 00:48:16,808
I am Chip's dad!

516
00:48:18,984 --> 00:48:20,884
Since when did that need explaining?

517
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:29,560
Chip!

518
00:48:29,594 --> 00:48:30,827
Joey, please...

519
00:48:30,862 --> 00:48:31,930
Chip, come on, we're going!

520
00:48:31,965 --> 00:48:32,897
Joey!

521
00:48:36,935 --> 00:48:39,062
So...

522
00:48:40,872 --> 00:48:44,899
So, this is a really lovely moresque.

523
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:49,948
You see how it has elements
like the wood detailing in the library.

524
00:48:49,983 --> 00:48:51,745
It痴 like a leaf. You see that?

525
00:48:53,652 --> 00:48:55,779
Except that it's a soft medium, it's a fabric.

526
00:48:56,188 --> 00:48:58,688
So it will converse well with its neighbor.

527
00:48:58,723 --> 00:49:02,627
You know, you won't feel like
you're jumping around room to room,

528
00:49:02,662 --> 00:49:05,118
but it will still allow this
room to have its own identity.

529
00:49:05,197 --> 00:49:09,031
You don't think it's too dark?
It looks like Paul's room.

530
00:49:11,036 --> 00:49:14,639
Well, the ivories in the
pattern keep it lighter, but

531
00:49:14,674 --> 00:49:17,607
you're right, it's not colorful.

532
00:49:17,642 --> 00:49:20,912
But also remember that we're talking
about fixed background elements.

533
00:49:20,947 --> 00:49:24,182
And you may not want a lot of color in
your fixed background elements.

534
00:49:24,217 --> 00:49:28,920
You can use color on the chairs, or in pillows,

535
00:49:28,955 --> 00:49:31,184
something like that. Something...

536
00:49:33,925 --> 00:49:36,894
like this azul.

537
00:49:39,764 --> 00:49:41,066
This burgundy fleur pattern.

538
00:49:41,101 --> 00:49:42,556
Oh my!

539
00:49:43,602 --> 00:49:45,570
And this is period?

540
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:50,139
Well, it's not contemporary with
when the house was built, but it's old.

541
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:55,180
So, so it would have, it would have
been available then. That's the nice thing.

542
00:49:55,215 --> 00:49:58,582
Old things keep popping up overtime.

543
00:49:58,617 --> 00:50:01,882
I mean the moresques were really popular
in Europe around the 16th century.

544
00:50:02,187 --> 00:50:06,886
But you saw them in places, like Venice,
earlier by the 15th century.

545
00:50:07,259 --> 00:50:10,888
And of course Muslim artists
used them far before that.

546
00:50:11,062 --> 00:50:12,028
Oh my.

547
00:50:12,063 --> 00:50:13,163
Oh, let me help you with those.

548
00:50:13,198 --> 00:50:18,602
Oh Paul! That's Joey. And this is...

549
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:20,772
I知 sorry dear, what's your name?

550
00:50:20,807 --> 00:50:21,905
Helen.

551
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:26,900
Helen is here. That was my husband Paul. Sorry.

552
00:50:27,245 --> 00:50:31,579
Now this is a library. Are you responsible for this?

553
00:50:31,916 --> 00:50:33,076
No way.

554
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:38,023
Your house, everything's so particular,
there's an expert for just about everything.

555
00:50:38,058 --> 00:50:41,059
No, I just make sure they get here
on time and have what they need.

556
00:50:41,094 --> 00:50:42,125
That's no small feat.

557
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,828
Pleasure to meet you, I知 Paul.

558
00:50:43,863 --> 00:50:44,795
Joey.

559
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,230
Hope you don't have too many more of these.

560
00:50:47,265 --> 00:50:51,224
We built you a little room to grow, but we
went off the collection the movers had.

561
00:50:51,936 --> 00:50:57,806
Damn movers packed everything.
These are new. Well, new acquisitions.

562
00:50:58,843 --> 00:51:00,811
Grandpa was kind of rough with them.

563
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,012
Yeah? Pages are strong though.

564
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:06,917
1799?

565
00:51:06,952 --> 00:51:08,185
Sure. Ha.

566
00:51:10,221 --> 00:51:14,180
You should get these rebound, you know?
Kind of sad to see them like this.

567
00:51:15,226 --> 00:51:17,194
A couple can probably just be restored.

568
00:51:18,663 --> 00:51:21,188
You sound like someone
who knows what he's talking about.

569
00:51:22,233 --> 00:51:27,193
Just something I picked up at one point, from someone
who really knew what they were doing.

570
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:30,036
That someone looking for work?

571
00:51:30,809 --> 00:51:35,644
Not right now.
But, I learned enough I can handle these.

572
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:37,648
Really?

573
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:38,816
Sure.

574
00:51:41,152 --> 00:51:44,178
Does this mean you go on the
payroll with the other experts?

575
00:51:46,191 --> 00:51:52,027
Naw, don't worry. I've got so much down time
these days, it'll help me earn my keep.

576
00:51:52,831 --> 00:51:56,028
Helen's pretty much in charge now,
and she knows what she's doing.

577
00:51:56,801 --> 00:51:59,634
No this will be good, you know.
Give me something to do between this and that.

578
00:52:00,205 --> 00:52:01,866
That'll be great, Joey

579
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,768
We should probably go over which ones you want done.
I noticed a couple over here that could use some work.

580
00:52:16,688 --> 00:52:17,788
Hey Chipmunk.

581
00:52:17,823 --> 00:52:18,889
Hey Daddy.

582
00:52:21,126 --> 00:52:24,220
Hey Blake. Dave.

583
00:52:28,633 --> 00:52:32,270
So, how was the big game there?

584
00:52:32,305 --> 00:52:33,488
We won!

585
00:52:33,523 --> 00:52:34,637
You won?

586
00:52:34,672 --> 00:52:36,774
It was 18 to 0.

587
00:52:36,809 --> 00:52:38,842
What? Nooo...

588
00:52:38,877 --> 00:52:43,940
Nooo... I don't believe you. Come on. 18 to 0?

589
00:52:48,787 --> 00:52:50,687
Hey Sally, it's Joey.

590
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:55,886
Good, good. So I wanted to check and
see what we can bring for Thanksgiving.

591
00:52:57,662 --> 00:52:58,890
Yeah, for Thanksgiving.

592
00:53:01,733 --> 00:53:04,702
I mean when we come for Thanksgiving,
you want us to bring anything?

593
00:53:06,805 --> 00:53:07,772
Sally, is every-

594
00:53:11,109 --> 00:53:15,603
Yeah, yeah... we kind of did. I-

595
00:53:17,649 --> 00:53:18,349
Sally, she-

596
00:53:20,185 --> 00:53:21,948
Yeah I know, but-

597
00:53:24,856 --> 00:53:28,053
Sally, when did I become
the bad guy all of a sudden?

598
00:53:29,861 --> 00:53:31,055
No I get it, but-

599
00:53:32,096 --> 00:53:34,064
Sure, I知 not asking you-

600
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:39,370
Sure.

601
00:53:42,307 --> 00:53:43,069
Okay.

602
00:53:45,677 --> 00:53:47,838
Yeah, yeah, keep the peace,
Sally, keep the peace.

603
00:53:51,649 --> 00:53:53,082
You're at least going to let Chip come, right?

604
00:53:57,655 --> 00:53:58,355
Alright.

605
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,158
Yeah.

606
00:54:04,195 --> 00:54:05,958
Okay, I値l drop him off then.

607
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:30,115
Hey, Chipmunk. Come here a sec.

608
00:54:46,671 --> 00:54:50,072
So, uh... here's an idea.

609
00:54:51,876 --> 00:54:55,835
How would you like to have
two Thanksgivings this year?

610
00:54:58,016 --> 00:55:03,588
You know, one day can be Thanksgiving.
Next day can be Thanksgiving too.

611
00:55:03,623 --> 00:55:04,722
Did you make this up?

612
00:55:04,757 --> 00:55:05,889
I kind of did.

613
00:55:05,924 --> 00:55:07,892
Can we have two Christmases too?

614
00:55:08,092 --> 00:55:09,910
Okay, let's not get-

615
00:55:09,945 --> 00:55:11,694
Okay. You said okay.

616
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:12,824
Alright, Mr. Smarty pants, we-

617
00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:13,920
Alright! You said alright!

618
00:55:16,568 --> 00:55:17,535
What?

619
00:55:19,203 --> 00:55:21,535
I知 afraid to say anything now.

620
00:55:21,773 --> 00:55:25,539
Fine. Don't be afraid. Say your things.

621
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,543
So uh,

622
00:55:27,912 --> 00:55:33,748
I thought Wednesday you and me, you know,
we could have our Thanksgiving.

623
00:55:34,218 --> 00:55:38,882
And then Thursday you can go to Grandma's,
have Thanksgiving there too.

624
00:55:39,157 --> 00:55:42,024
Is this because you and
Auntie Eileen are fighting?

625
00:55:43,628 --> 00:55:47,894
Yeah. Auntie Eileen's
not too happy with me right now.

626
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:53,897
And to tell you the truth,
I知 not so happy with her.

627
00:55:55,773 --> 00:55:58,139
So it's probably better
we a little time to cool off.

628
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:02,869
It'd probably be weird to be in a room with us
when we're both unhappy like that, yeah?

629
00:56:03,014 --> 00:56:06,609
It痴 just weird being in a room with you, Daddy.

630
00:56:07,018 --> 00:56:08,885
You don't say.

631
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,114
Weird, weird, weird.

632
00:56:11,623 --> 00:56:14,624
I知 not weird, Chipmunk.

633
00:56:14,659 --> 00:56:16,626
And you call everyone Chipmunk.

634
00:56:16,661 --> 00:56:18,895
Only those who deserve it, Chipmunk.

635
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,666
Okay, okay! We can have our weird Thanksgiving.

636
00:56:21,701 --> 00:56:22,632
Thank you, Chipmunk.

637
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:24,669
Do we have to have turkey though?

638
00:56:24,704 --> 00:56:25,636
Are you kidding?

639
00:56:26,671 --> 00:56:30,903
It is our Thanksgiving,
we can have whatever we want.

640
00:56:31,643 --> 00:56:32,609
Rice krispie treats?

641
00:56:32,644 --> 00:56:34,908
Okay, rice krispie treats.

642
00:56:35,279 --> 00:56:38,840
But uh, we should probably
have something else too.

643
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,117
Yeah.

644
00:56:40,152 --> 00:56:41,085
Yeah.

645
00:56:43,154 --> 00:56:44,121
Chili mac.

646
00:56:44,889 --> 00:56:49,690
Hey, that we can do. What is that?

647
00:56:50,628 --> 00:56:51,329
Rice krispie treats.

648
00:56:51,364 --> 00:56:52,064
Rice krispie treats...

649
00:56:52,065 --> 00:56:53,031
And chili mac.

650
00:56:53,066 --> 00:56:53,998
Chili mac...

651
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:58,036
And we should probably
have some veggies too, no?

652
00:56:58,071 --> 00:56:59,104
Nah.

653
00:56:59,139 --> 00:57:00,137
No?

654
00:57:00,738 --> 00:57:01,839
Some greens, yeah?

655
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:02,931
Green jello.

656
00:57:04,142 --> 00:57:05,803
I don't think that's a vegetable.

657
00:57:06,244 --> 00:57:08,878
Green M&Ms.

658
00:57:08,913 --> 00:57:11,683
Nope. I don't think that's a vegetable either.

659
00:57:11,718 --> 00:57:12,707
Green cake.

660
00:57:13,685 --> 00:57:15,710
You're not very good at this, are you?

661
00:57:16,654 --> 00:57:17,405
Nope.

662
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,140
Nope.

663
00:57:18,156 --> 00:57:19,657
Not a veggie guy.

664
00:57:19,692 --> 00:57:20,624
No, I知 not.

665
00:57:30,835 --> 00:57:34,896
You ready? Yeah?

666
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:39,034
Alright, go on. I値l pick you up tomorrow afternoon.

667
00:57:51,689 --> 00:57:52,656
You got it.

668
00:58:08,773 --> 00:58:12,643
Can I just say I知 sorry right now? Get it over with.

669
00:58:12,678 --> 00:58:13,610
It痴 okay.

670
00:58:13,778 --> 00:58:14,777
Cody!

671
00:58:14,812 --> 00:58:18,116
Hey Dave, how you doing? Good to see you.
This is Joey. Joey, Dave. Dave, Joey.

672
00:58:18,151 --> 00:58:20,607
You don't have to worry about
Dave so much, he's okay.

673
00:58:21,085 --> 00:58:22,609
Hey Eileen, how you doing?

674
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,656
Hey Joey, I want you to meet my sister Eileen.

675
00:58:25,691 --> 00:58:27,658
Eileen, this is Joey. Joey, Eileen.

676
00:58:27,693 --> 00:58:28,676
Hey Eileen.

677
00:58:28,711 --> 00:58:29,686
Is that them?

678
00:58:29,721 --> 00:58:30,674
That's us.

679
00:58:30,709 --> 00:58:31,628
Is that Cody?

680
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:32,830
That's me.

681
00:58:32,964 --> 00:58:34,063
This is Joey.

682
00:58:34,098 --> 00:58:38,768
Joey! Oh, you must be Joey.

683
00:58:38,803 --> 00:58:42,723
Welcome. Welcome to, welcome to Thanksgiving.

684
00:58:42,758 --> 00:58:46,644
Yeah Mama, Mama he knows what Thanksgiving is.

685
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:49,145
Welcome to our Thanksgiving.

686
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:52,149
Yes, let's all thank Joey for coming
down from outer space for Thanksgiving.

687
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:56,086
It痴 okay. Thanks for having me ma'am.

688
00:58:57,188 --> 00:58:59,857
Mr. Hines? It痴 good to meet you.

689
00:58:59,892 --> 00:59:01,343
It痴 really good to see you.

690
00:59:01,378 --> 00:59:02,759
Oh what a polite young man.

691
00:59:02,794 --> 00:59:06,763
I didn't know they made
them like that in outer space.

692
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:11,758
Do you, do you, would you like a drink?
You know, a wine cooler?

693
00:59:13,704 --> 00:59:15,838
What? I don't know what he drinks.

694
00:59:15,873 --> 00:59:17,208
It痴 okay. No, of course you don't. It痴 okay.

695
00:59:17,243 --> 00:59:19,904
How am I supposed to know what he drinks?

696
00:59:21,212 --> 00:59:26,884
Joey, could you come in here? There's this uh,
shelf in the pantry that I would...

697
00:59:26,919 --> 00:59:28,786
Mama! You're not going to put him to work now.

698
00:59:28,821 --> 00:59:29,952
Well, you said he was good at that.

699
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:34,058
Well Mama, if it痴 a shelf, Dave can
take care of it! Dave, take care of it.

700
00:59:34,093 --> 00:59:36,060
Well Dave is too tall.

701
00:59:36,095 --> 00:59:37,160
Mama!

702
00:59:37,195 --> 00:59:39,864
I知 sorry, I値l be right back. You're too tall.

703
00:59:39,899 --> 00:59:41,161
What? What did I do?

704
00:59:41,666 --> 00:59:42,900
It痴 a low shelf, so...

705
00:59:42,935 --> 00:59:43,867
Ah, it happens.

706
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:30,847
Surprise!

707
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:32,216
Happy Thanksgiving, Joey!

708
01:00:32,251 --> 01:00:34,081
Hey! Yeah, surprise.

709
01:00:34,685 --> 01:00:37,121
You didn't think we'd let you spend
Thanksgiving alone now, did you?

710
01:00:37,156 --> 01:00:39,089
Sometimes alone ain't so bad.

711
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:41,553
Well, come in, come in.

712
01:00:41,926 --> 01:00:44,986
Hell, I may start a sneaking
out Thanksgiving tradition.

713
01:00:47,965 --> 01:00:51,924
Oh no. Joey, no.

714
01:00:53,971 --> 01:00:55,706
We are here for, what do they call that?

715
01:00:55,741 --> 01:00:56,873
An intervention.

716
01:00:56,908 --> 01:01:01,913
That's right, an intervention. We are here
to save you from your own cooking.

717
01:01:01,948 --> 01:01:04,882
Hey... now that was made with love.

718
01:01:06,651 --> 01:01:07,919
Okay, it was made with Chip, but...

719
01:01:07,954 --> 01:01:09,887
Aaah. We may be too late.

720
01:02:08,145 --> 01:02:11,012
Hello, you've reached the Hines' home.

721
01:02:39,677 --> 01:02:40,735
Hello?

722
01:02:40,911 --> 01:02:42,742
Oh, hello Sally?

723
01:02:43,614 --> 01:02:45,047
Oh. Yes.

724
01:02:46,684 --> 01:02:47,878
Sally, it's Joey.

725
01:02:48,753 --> 01:02:50,186
Yes. Joey.

726
01:02:51,922 --> 01:02:54,584
Turkey must have really knocked you out,
I致e been out here ringing your bell.

727
01:02:55,726 --> 01:02:57,023
Yes, I know.

728
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:02,155
Sally, what's going on?
Why didn't you come to the door?

729
01:03:07,138 --> 01:03:08,696
Sally, is something wrong? Are you okay?

730
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:14,700
Sally, are you there? Sally do-

731
01:03:14,779 --> 01:03:16,007
Chip isn't here, Joey.

732
01:03:17,915 --> 01:03:23,012
What do you mean he isn't here? I told you
I was coming by to pick him up. Sally, where is he?

733
01:03:25,923 --> 01:03:28,892
I知 sorry, Joey, I知 sorry.

734
01:03:30,061 --> 01:03:34,555
But, it's okay. Chip is with his family.

735
01:03:34,899 --> 01:03:36,560
Sally, what's going on?

736
01:03:37,601 --> 01:03:42,173
Eileen. You see, Eileen is the legal guardian.

737
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:44,266
She said the judge said so.

738
01:03:45,009 --> 01:03:49,013
And she and Dave, they'll take really good care of Chip.

739
01:03:49,048 --> 01:03:49,980
Sally!

740
01:03:50,347 --> 01:03:55,148
You've looked after him really well, Joey.
We all know that.

741
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,153
And we hope...

742
01:03:57,188 --> 01:03:58,320
Sally, I am Chip's dad!

743
01:03:58,355 --> 01:04:04,089
Joey, you were so good for Cody.

744
01:04:05,129 --> 01:04:07,097
Cody after Rebecca.

745
01:04:07,798 --> 01:04:12,599
And Joey, it was so nice...

746
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:16,135
my Cody and Rebecca, the two of them.

747
01:04:17,274 --> 01:04:19,944
And Chip looks just like Rebecca...

748
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:21,070
Sally!

749
01:04:23,114 --> 01:04:24,581
Why are you doing this?

750
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:34,980
Where are they? Where did they take Chip?

751
01:04:36,026 --> 01:04:38,324
Sally, where did they take Chip?

752
01:04:43,701 --> 01:04:47,603
No, Joey. It'll just make it harder.

753
01:04:48,806 --> 01:04:50,831
It値l just make it harder.

754
01:04:53,878 --> 01:04:54,845
Thank you.

755
01:04:59,917 --> 01:05:02,886
Come on, Eileen, I know
you're in there. Open up!

756
01:05:04,922 --> 01:05:08,881
Chip! Hey, Chipmunk, can you hear me?

757
01:05:09,894 --> 01:05:12,658
It痴 going to be okay.
We're going to go home soon.

758
01:05:13,097 --> 01:05:16,157
Eileen! Eileen!

759
01:06:34,612 --> 01:06:36,273
You can bring them back now.

760
01:09:33,123 --> 01:09:34,283
Hey, you okay?

761
01:09:39,696 --> 01:09:43,033
Whoa! Careful, I don't think you want
to be swimming around in this mess.

762
01:09:43,068 --> 01:09:44,535
This is Rebecca's...

763
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:46,002
It痴 okay, alright?

764
01:09:47,337 --> 01:09:48,964
She loved... I...

765
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:53,999
Sit back. It痴 okay, Cody.
Sit back. Okay? Sit back.

766
01:09:56,046 --> 01:09:58,913
You know, this is nothing.

767
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:01,051
Yeah, we'll put this back together again.

768
01:10:01,086 --> 01:10:02,143
I didn't mean to.

769
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:03,911
We'll put it back together again, no problem.

770
01:10:06,356 --> 01:10:09,086
Yeah, just sit back. Here we go, here we go.

771
01:10:10,661 --> 01:10:11,753
Okay.

772
01:10:18,335 --> 01:10:19,859
Good, um...

773
01:10:27,978 --> 01:10:29,775
Can't put her back together again.

774
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:34,776
Cody, I...

775
01:10:37,921 --> 01:10:38,888
She's gone.

776
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:45,893
Yeah. I know.

777
01:10:52,369 --> 01:10:53,859
She's gone...

778
01:11:06,116 --> 01:11:08,084
She was something else, wasn't she?

779
01:11:08,185 --> 01:11:09,345
Wasn't she?

780
01:11:09,853 --> 01:11:11,343
Yeah.

781
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,325
Hold on.

782
01:11:21,398 --> 01:11:23,923
What is it? You need something?

783
01:11:44,655 --> 01:11:45,952
Sorry about that.

784
01:11:54,097 --> 01:11:57,968
Yeah, that was a good one.

785
01:11:58,003 --> 01:11:59,060
I didn't mean to.

786
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:08,176
Well, let me...

787
01:12:08,211 --> 01:12:11,180
No, no, no. It痴 okay. Just leave it.

788
01:12:13,817 --> 01:12:18,186
It痴 okay. I値l be right back. Okay?

789
01:12:32,336 --> 01:12:34,031
Sorry about the mess.

790
01:12:35,372 --> 01:12:39,001
Hey, it's Tennessee. It happens.

791
01:13:38,802 --> 01:13:41,032
Hey. Cody, where's Chip?

792
01:13:45,409 --> 01:13:50,608
Oh. Chip's... Chip's at his grandparents now.

793
01:13:54,084 --> 01:13:56,920
That's where he is...
at his grandparents... not here...

794
01:13:56,955 --> 01:13:58,683
Okay. Okay good. Good good good.

795
01:14:02,225 --> 01:14:04,693
Then we only got one baby to take care of.

796
01:14:06,396 --> 01:14:09,733
Let's uh, let's get you cleaned up,
you've got some stuff...

797
01:14:09,768 --> 01:14:10,766
No, you don't have to do that.

798
01:14:10,801 --> 01:14:13,929
Yeah, yeah, you just sit back and shut up.

799
01:14:17,307 --> 01:14:18,706
What'd you say?

800
01:14:20,811 --> 01:14:23,939
Shut up. Is that how you talk to a baby?

801
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:55,941
Yeah, come on, you need some rest.

802
01:14:57,214 --> 01:15:01,947
This you don't need. Rest you need. Come on.

803
01:15:09,326 --> 01:15:10,623
I don't know what to do.

804
01:15:18,335 --> 01:15:19,700
I don't know what to do.

805
01:15:31,882 --> 01:15:33,008
I don't know what to do.

806
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:40,619
Sure you don't. I mean, that's natural.

807
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,050
What am I supposed to do?

808
01:15:46,096 --> 01:15:48,064
Cody, you'll figure it out.

809
01:15:49,099 --> 01:15:50,100
Don't you tell me to figure it out!

810
01:15:50,135 --> 01:15:51,067
Hey!

811
01:16:05,115 --> 01:16:06,514
I just need to know what to do.

812
01:16:16,293 --> 01:16:19,057
I知 so- I知 sorry, I just...

813
01:16:21,097 --> 01:16:23,099
No, it's okay, I知...

814
01:16:23,134 --> 01:16:24,862
You're terrible at this.

815
01:16:24,897 --> 01:16:26,591
Yeah, yeah I kind of am.

816
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,941
Yeah nothing makes sense.

817
01:16:44,287 --> 01:16:48,917
Yeah uh... I致e been there.

818
01:16:51,561 --> 01:16:52,261
No.

819
01:16:54,831 --> 01:16:56,833
You don't know what it's like now.

820
01:16:56,868 --> 01:16:59,233
Yup, shut up, I have.

821
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:02,438
Yeah?

822
01:17:03,273 --> 01:17:04,240
Yeah.

823
01:17:05,609 --> 01:17:06,598
Yeah, who died?

824
01:17:09,012 --> 01:17:10,877
Uh, sister.

825
01:17:12,616 --> 01:17:16,108
Mother... father...

826
01:17:17,621 --> 01:17:21,113
Foster father... foster mother.

827
01:17:24,027 --> 01:17:25,295
Seriously?

828
01:17:25,330 --> 01:17:26,262
Yup.

829
01:17:29,266 --> 01:17:31,063
All those people?

830
01:17:32,102 --> 01:17:33,069
Yup.

831
01:17:56,126 --> 01:17:58,094
See what we got here.

832
01:18:04,134 --> 01:18:07,297
I think maybe I壇 be a good contractor.
I think I壇 be a good...

833
01:18:08,638 --> 01:18:12,130
carpenter. Think maybe I ought to try it.

834
01:18:14,844 --> 01:18:18,610
Okay! I think you need to sleep on it.

835
01:18:23,086 --> 01:18:23,852
Yeah.

836
01:18:23,887 --> 01:18:25,047
Yeah, come on.

837
01:18:26,089 --> 01:18:27,655
Yeah? Yeah.

01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:29,222
Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah I値l do it...

841
01:18:57,253 --> 01:18:59,153
These are kind of tough.

842
01:19:07,864 --> 01:19:08,728
Good?

843
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:14,832
Uh... don't you want to brush
your teeth or something?

844
01:19:18,775 --> 01:19:21,073
Man, you're going to regret that, um...

845
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:24,480
Here.

846
01:19:29,386 --> 01:19:31,581
Come on, you'll feel a little
less nasty in the morning.

847
01:21:03,646 --> 01:21:04,844
Oh Betsy, have you seen...

848
01:21:04,879 --> 01:21:06,042
They're in the hallway, Miss.

849
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:09,586
So when I went to go look for him at Eileen's...

850
01:21:09,621 --> 01:21:12,589
Good morning. Sorry, I,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

851
01:21:12,624 --> 01:21:15,258
No problem. Did you need me or Helen?

852
01:21:15,293 --> 01:21:16,224
Helen.

853
01:21:16,259 --> 01:21:18,695

What the hell.

856
01:23:51,681 --> 01:23:53,706
Joey, I知 so sorry...

857
01:23:55,585 --> 01:23:57,644
Oh, this is wrong!

858
01:23:59,756 --> 01:24:00,989
Helen, this is wrong!

859
01:24:01,024 --> 01:24:02,890
Yeah, you don't have to convince me.

860
01:24:02,925 --> 01:24:07,259
Joey, what kind of beer you got?
Never mind. I can get it. You sit down, Joey.

861
01:24:08,031 --> 01:24:11,262
You just... sit down.

862
01:24:29,085 --> 01:24:30,712
Gloria, hey.

863
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:33,255
Chicken pot pie.

864
01:24:34,757 --> 01:24:39,295
You're an angel, Gloria.
Just thoughtful beyond belief. Thank you.

865
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:40,592
Got it. And do you have...

866
01:24:40,663 --> 01:24:42,597
Yeah, I have his number here.

867
01:24:42,665 --> 01:24:44,767
Well, I値l let you get back to your guests.

868
01:24:44,802 --> 01:24:46,735
Gloria, there's just a couple of us.

869
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:51,732
Can you come in for a bit?
More company tonight would be nice.

870
01:24:53,943 --> 01:24:55,137
Yeah? Wonderful

871
01:24:56,679 --> 01:25:01,639
Hey everyone, this is Gloria. She teaches at
Cody's school. Gloria this is Helen and Anne.

872
01:25:02,652 --> 01:25:06,884
And sorry, it's been a while since we've had
company. Can I get you something to drink, Gloria?

873
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:08,291
Do you have tea?

874
01:25:08,326 --> 01:25:09,026
Sure, sure.

875
01:25:10,093 --> 01:25:12,254
Joey, how many women you got feeding you?

876
01:25:13,296 --> 01:25:17,289
Can you believe what Eileen did? Seriously,
the police? As if Joey would hurt anyone.

877
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,892
Who's Eileen?

878
01:25:19,936 --> 01:25:24,941
Joey, you got to let your people know what's going on.
We're good for more than just cooking.

879
01:25:24,976 --> 01:25:27,110
Yeah, I know. I知 sorry, Gloria.

880
01:25:27,145 --> 01:25:28,178
Who's Eileen?

881
01:25:28,213 --> 01:25:29,177
Cody's sister.

882
01:25:29,212 --> 01:25:30,179
She took Chip away.

883
01:25:30,380 --> 01:25:32,848
Wouldn't let Joey see him,
not a word of discussion.

884
01:25:33,116 --> 01:25:34,615
Joey goes to pick him up one day...

885
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:37,987
And sorry. No. You know what? He's our kid now.

886
01:25:38,022 --> 01:25:39,072
We don't need you.

887
01:25:39,107 --> 01:25:40,123
Can you believe that?

888
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:41,089
And stay away.

889
01:25:41,124 --> 01:25:42,091
Then this happened today.

890
01:25:43,726 --> 01:25:45,091
A restraining order.

891
01:25:47,063 --> 01:25:51,033
Okay, I have known Eileen for a while. And you
know our kids have grown up together.

892
01:25:51,068 --> 01:25:55,304
But she should have gotten
the restraining order on me,

893
01:25:55,339 --> 01:25:57,974
because I am going to kill her!

894
01:25:58,009 --> 01:25:58,840
Do it.

895
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:00,843
I mean what is she thinking? I mean seriously!

896
01:26:01,644 --> 01:26:04,846
Trying to keep Joey away from Chip?

897
01:26:04,881 --> 01:26:08,840
I mean, why do you want to spend your
time on that? Why? Why that?

898
01:26:09,051 --> 01:26:10,952
We've been coming up with a list of names,

899
01:26:10,987 --> 01:26:14,946
people who have gone through
some sort of child custody case or...

900
01:26:28,404 --> 01:26:30,065
Charles, it's Gloria.

901
01:26:30,606 --> 01:26:35,669
Yeah. Be in your office tomorrow at four,
I知 sending a friend over. Treat him right.

902
01:26:36,712 --> 01:26:38,881
Yeah, his name is Joey Hines.

903
01:26:38,916 --> 01:26:40,081
It痴 Williams.

904
01:26:40,116 --> 01:26:43,574
Williams. Sorry. Joey Williams. Yeah.

905
01:26:50,293 --> 01:26:55,754
Charles did my divorces and my
custody case. Talk to him tomorrow.

906
01:26:56,632 --> 01:26:58,901
How come I haven't met Gloria before?

907
01:26:58,936 --> 01:26:59,868
Here you go, Gloria.

908
01:27:00,903 --> 01:27:04,202
Ah! She gets things done.

909
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,198
We like Gloria.

910
01:27:07,143 --> 01:27:11,512
Thanks. Yeah, it'll be good to talk to your friend.

911
01:27:12,548 --> 01:27:15,073
I致e talked to some lawyers
over the phone, and uh...

912
01:27:15,785 --> 01:27:17,753
they pretty much can't
get off the phone fast enough.

913
01:27:18,287 --> 01:27:21,756
Well you got Charles tomorrow.
And all these people, Joey.

914
01:27:21,791 --> 01:27:26,922
And these are friends, not just some stranger on
the phone. They're going to help you figure something out.

915
01:27:29,298 --> 01:27:34,930
Trying to keep Chip away from his dad, I swear... Eileen...

916
01:27:36,105 --> 01:27:36,973
Get you another, Joey?

917
01:27:37,008 --> 01:27:38,531
Uh, yeah.

918
01:27:38,841 --> 01:27:39,705
Helen?

919
01:27:40,309 --> 01:27:41,708
Please.

920
01:27:49,318 --> 01:27:50,980
What's a Paiste?

921
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:52,643
What's a who?

922
01:27:53,689 --> 01:27:57,090
Paiste. Irish dragon.

923
01:28:00,096 --> 01:28:02,792
She's a teacher. They know things.

924
01:28:03,866 --> 01:28:07,666
Chip, he's kind of going through a dragon phase right now.

925
01:28:09,005 --> 01:28:12,668
We used to look up a dragon a week.
You know, look up all the stories about him.

926
01:28:13,609 --> 01:28:15,839
Well that was Cody and Chip's job,
to do all this research.

927
01:28:16,612 --> 01:28:20,883
They'd give me these pictures and I壇
make Chip a little block with the dragon on it.

928
01:28:20,918 --> 01:28:24,518
He calls them blocks. They're art.
Have you seen these things?

929
01:28:24,553 --> 01:28:28,118
Well he can definitely spell
some really strange words now.

930
01:28:29,892 --> 01:28:33,828
You know, since Chip started school,
he wasn't so thrilled about Mondays.

931
01:28:34,564 --> 01:28:39,524
So, Monday morning he'd get a new block, you
know, give him something to look forward to.

932
01:28:41,003 --> 01:28:43,573
I guess I just kinda forgot since Cody...

933
01:28:43,608 --> 01:28:45,200
I mean look at this.

934
01:28:45,575 --> 01:28:47,543
Oh yeah, that's Fafnir.

935
01:28:48,878 --> 01:28:52,974
Aaah... Norse. Helmet and heart.

936
01:28:53,316 --> 01:28:56,185
I went through a dragon phase myself.

937
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:59,054
Oh Gloria, you are full of surprises.

938
01:28:59,188 --> 01:29:04,093
This was Chip's thing.
Man, of all the things to forget.

939
01:29:04,128 --> 01:29:05,151
So make it.

940
01:29:05,661 --> 01:29:09,198
Make him his P-, Pie-, Paste, Pasta...

941
01:29:09,233 --> 01:29:10,722
Paiste.

942
01:29:12,268 --> 01:29:13,235
I値l give it to him.

943
01:29:14,103 --> 01:29:15,570
No, I can't ask you to-

944
01:29:15,605 --> 01:29:18,574
You're not. I知 telling you, do it.

945
01:29:23,012 --> 01:29:25,572
I知 telling you,
she should have gotten one for me.

946
01:29:49,639 --> 01:29:50,606
Okay.

947
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,838
Okay? Okay, good.

948
01:29:57,647 --> 01:29:58,648
Would you mind also uh...

949
01:29:58,683 --> 01:29:59,615
Yeah.

950
01:32:12,348 --> 01:32:17,820
Hey. Chip's not feeling so well today.
Let's let him rest a little, okay?

951
01:32:17,855 --> 01:32:19,048
Okay. Come on, Blake.

952
01:32:28,097 --> 01:32:31,066
Hey Chipmunk. So...

953
01:32:32,168 --> 01:32:35,729
I know it's been a while, but guess what?

954
01:32:36,272 --> 01:32:39,571
Daddy's got another dragon story for you. Yeah?

955
01:32:40,709 --> 01:32:43,337
This is a story about a dragon named Paiste.

956
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:48,709
And the dragon was old, really old.

957
01:32:48,984 --> 01:32:53,045
You know, they say Paiste was left
over from the beginning of time.

958
01:32:53,923 --> 01:32:59,054
And the beginning of time must have been a pretty
scary place if everyone looked like him. Yeah?

959
01:32:59,995 --> 01:33:05,956
He had these horns shooting out from his head,
and each year they got stronger and sharper.

960
01:33:06,302 --> 01:33:09,738
His body was long and huge.

961
01:33:10,005 --> 01:33:15,739
His scales were like an armor he never took off.
He always lived with all his horrible parts.

962
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:20,740
And he was the original fire-breathing dragon.

963
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:26,117
In a single afternoon your whole village
could disappear. Yeah, just gone to ashes.

964
01:33:26,889 --> 01:33:29,858
Well, there was this one village,

965
01:33:30,292 --> 01:33:34,023
a village with a funny name
Daddy can't pronounce, so...

966
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:36,264
we're just going to call it the East Village.

967
01:33:37,066 --> 01:33:39,034
And the people of the East Village,

968
01:33:39,635 --> 01:33:44,605
they saw how every year the fires were getting
closer and closer, and so they thought,

969
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:49,600
Man, we better do something about this dragon,
or the East Village is going to be burned to ashes.

970
01:33:50,346 --> 01:33:54,715
Now, there happened to live
up in the mountains near the East Village...

971
01:33:55,084 --> 01:33:56,608
an old Saint.

972
01:33:57,753 --> 01:33:58,845
The people thought,

973
01:33:59,188 --> 01:34:02,157
Well, if anyone will know
what to do, it'll be this guy.

974
01:34:02,892 --> 01:34:06,561
So they went up the mountain and
they begged the Saint and said,

975
01:34:06,596 --> 01:34:10,230
Please help us, or the East Village
is going to be burned to ashes.

976
01:34:11,066 --> 01:34:14,229
And the Saint, well he said,

977
01:34:14,904 --> 01:34:17,236
Sure. Why not?

978
01:34:17,873 --> 01:34:21,001
So, you know, the Saint goes to see Paiste.

979
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:25,046
And, the dragon sees him coming, and he thought,

980
01:34:25,681 --> 01:34:29,583
Great, the food's coming to me now. This is the life.

981
01:34:30,219 --> 01:34:31,652
The dragon says to the Saint,

982
01:34:32,087 --> 01:34:35,648
Are you a sacrifice? May I eat you now?

983
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:39,025
Dragons can be polite when
they're pleased, you know.

984
01:34:39,628 --> 01:34:42,358
And the Saint lied and said, 'Yes.''

985
01:34:43,232 --> 01:34:45,801
Well the dragon opened its mouth to
eat the Saint and the Saint shouted,

986
01:34:45,836 --> 01:34:50,568
Wait! Your sacrifice needs to be properly prepared.

987
01:34:51,774 --> 01:34:54,572
And the Saint started to do a dance.

988
01:34:55,644 --> 01:34:57,839
Oh it wasn't a very good dance, but

989
01:34:58,781 --> 01:35:01,750
the dragon waited, patiently.

990
01:35:02,384 --> 01:35:05,012
The Saint then started shaking some sticks in the air,

991
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:08,690
and the dragon waited, you know, patiently.

992
01:35:09,124 --> 01:35:14,585
The Saint then, he dropped
the sticks along the dragon's back.

993
01:35:15,631 --> 01:35:17,599
And the dragon waited patiently.

994
01:35:18,233 --> 01:35:21,464
The Saint then started to sing
and finally the dragon said,

995
01:35:21,499 --> 01:35:24,695
Are you done yet?
And the Saint cried, 'Yes!'' you know.

996
01:35:25,074 --> 01:35:26,939
He clapped his hands,

997
01:35:27,743 --> 01:35:30,041
and those sticks he dropped
along the dragon's back,

998
01:35:30,946 --> 01:35:34,143
they turned into huge ropes that twisted
around the dragon and trapped him.

999
01:35:35,184 --> 01:35:38,312
Oh Paiste struggled, but he couldn't break free.

1000
01:35:39,621 --> 01:35:42,920
The Saint then yelled, ''To the sea!''

1001
01:35:43,692 --> 01:35:47,822
And the ropes carried the
dragon to the bottom of the sea.

1002
01:35:48,964 --> 01:35:52,161
And there he is, even today.

1003
01:35:53,302 --> 01:35:55,770
Yeah, still alive at the bottom of the sea.

1004
01:35:56,872 --> 01:35:59,932
They say he's going to
live there until Judgement Day,

1005
01:36:01,543 --> 01:36:07,543
when they decide whether he was
really evil or just a misunderstood dragon.

1006
01:36:11,153 --> 01:36:15,590
And uh, even though he's really old, and
even though the ropes are really tight,

1007
01:36:16,525 --> 01:36:18,652
Paiste will still try to break free sometimes.

1008
01:36:19,528 --> 01:36:25,528
Oh yeah, he struggles and struggles and
splashes around at the bottom of the sea.

1009
01:36:27,636 --> 01:36:31,595
That's why sometimes, when you go to the beach,

1010
01:36:32,808 --> 01:36:34,274
after a lot of little waves,

1011
01:36:34,309 --> 01:36:37,176
you'll get that one really big one.

1012
01:36:38,547 --> 01:36:42,108
Hey that's Paiste, trying to break free.

1013
01:37:00,269 --> 01:37:01,896
Hey Chipmunk.

1014
01:37:06,275 --> 01:37:08,038
Hey Chipmunk.

1015
01:37:14,716 --> 01:37:15,916
Mr. Williams?

1016
01:37:15,951 --> 01:37:17,816
Yes, I知 Joey Williams.

1017
01:37:18,087 --> 01:37:19,577
It痴 good to meet you.

1018
01:37:20,622 --> 01:37:22,681
Okay. Come in.

1019
01:37:25,561 --> 01:37:27,825
Yeah, Gloria had a lot of good things to say about you.

1020
01:37:27,896 --> 01:37:32,526
Well, they don't make 'em like Gloria anymore.
We've been through some times.

1021
01:37:34,103 --> 01:37:35,832
You from around here, Joey?

1022
01:37:35,867 --> 01:37:37,562
Yeah, I grew up here in Martin.

1023
01:37:37,706 --> 01:37:40,197
Huh. You don't say.

1024
01:37:41,877 --> 01:37:47,877
So, I知 sorry about the formality,
we get so many folks in here,

1025
01:37:48,018 --> 01:37:49,885
it just helps to keep things straight.

1026
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:50,852
Sure, sure.

1027
01:37:51,887 --> 01:37:53,855
So it says here this is a child custody case?

1028
01:37:54,823 --> 01:37:57,690
Well you want to tell me a little
about what's going on, Joey?

1029
01:37:58,127 --> 01:38:01,688
Yeah, sure um... so my kid Chip,

1030
01:38:02,631 --> 01:38:05,862
he's six now. His mom died when he was born,

1031
01:38:06,268 --> 01:38:08,303
and Cody and I raised him together all this time.

1032
01:38:08,338 --> 01:38:09,069
And we did-

1033
01:38:09,104 --> 01:38:10,594
I知 sorry, who's Cody?

1034
01:38:10,906 --> 01:38:12,567
Cody is Chip's dad.

1035
01:38:12,841 --> 01:38:14,240
I thought you were Chip's dad.

1036
01:38:15,110 --> 01:38:19,103
Yeah, what is it they say, Chip has two daddies.

1037
01:38:20,749 --> 01:38:25,550
So when Cody died, um,
things were fine for a while.

1038
01:38:25,821 --> 01:38:28,585
I mean, they weren't fine, but

1039
01:38:30,259 --> 01:38:33,820
there weren't any problems with Chip.
You know, we kept on the way we'd been doing.

1040
01:38:34,763 --> 01:38:37,596
And then, Eileen, now that's Cody's sister,

1041
01:38:38,267 --> 01:38:41,600
tells me weeks later that Cody's
will made her Chip's guardian.

1042
01:38:42,271 --> 01:38:44,739
They took him away,
you know didn't let me see him.

1043
01:38:45,274 --> 01:38:47,643
A couple of days later I get this
restraining order that tells me-

1044
01:38:47,678 --> 01:38:49,076
Now let me stop you there, Mr. Williams.

1045
01:38:54,616 --> 01:38:58,848
Now, Mr. Williams, you wrote on this
sheet that this is a child custody case.

1046
01:38:59,555 --> 01:39:03,685
But I will tell you frankly,
you do not have a child custody case.

1047
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:07,028
Let me guess, I知 not the
first lawyer you've talked to.

1048
01:39:07,329 --> 01:39:08,529
No, sir.

1049
01:39:08,564 --> 01:39:13,297
And my guess is they pretty much all stop
you at this point and with good reason.

1050
01:39:14,236 --> 01:39:17,205
Mr. Williams, you do not have a child custody case.

1051
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:22,642
Now, you may be able to dig and find some crackpot

1052
01:39:22,677 --> 01:39:26,544
who will throw around some hallelujah phrases like

1053
01:39:26,682 --> 01:39:31,142
psychological parent or
''presumed parent'' or shit like that.

1054
01:39:32,254 --> 01:39:35,985
And he'll feed you these words
while happily cashing your checks.

1055
01:39:36,592 --> 01:39:40,221
But uh, I知 a moral man, Mr. Williams.

1056
01:39:40,896 --> 01:39:46,198
I cannot take your money to say to the
world that you are really this kid's father.

1057
01:39:50,005 --> 01:39:54,203
Now, because you're Gloria's friend,
let me give you this advice.

1058
01:39:55,344 --> 01:39:57,642
Even if you find your lawyer,

1059
01:39:58,013 --> 01:40:02,313
you will never find a judge around here
who will legitimize that kind of stuff.

1060
01:40:04,886 --> 01:40:05,716
Alright?

1061
01:40:07,589 --> 01:40:09,147
It痴 the truth.

1062
01:40:10,592 --> 01:40:13,322
I知 sorry you had to come
all the way down here to hear it.

1063
01:40:15,764 --> 01:40:19,165
You uh, you give my best to Gloria now.

1064
01:40:38,587 --> 01:40:40,721
Joey? Are you still here?

1065
01:40:40,756 --> 01:40:43,589
Yeah, uh, wanted to finish
up a couple little things.

1066
01:40:44,059 --> 01:40:45,617
Is Ed still here?

1067
01:40:46,094 --> 01:40:47,721
No, he went home for the day.

1068
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:49,330
Just you?

1069
01:40:50,165 --> 01:40:51,132
Yeah.

1070
01:40:52,301 --> 01:40:54,030
Did you need something?

1071
01:40:54,936 --> 01:40:57,734
No. No.

1072
01:40:58,340 --> 01:40:59,864
Good night, Joey.

1073
01:40:59,941 --> 01:41:00,908
Good night, Marge.

1074
01:41:23,298 --> 01:41:25,766
Yeah, no I understand.

1075
01:41:27,803 --> 01:41:29,293
I appreciate you taking the time.

1076
01:41:31,206 --> 01:41:33,766
Yeah, uh, I definitely will.

1077
01:42:30,198 --> 01:42:31,222
Hey Joey?

1078
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:32,567
Yeah Ed.

1079
01:42:32,868 --> 01:42:34,028
Ready for you.

1080
01:42:34,302 --> 01:42:35,269
Alright.

1081
01:42:39,775 --> 01:42:40,639
I知 sorry.

1082
01:44:18,974 --> 01:44:19,674
Hello?

1083
01:44:20,876 --> 01:44:23,003
Gloria, hey, this is Anne!

1084
01:44:24,079 --> 01:44:27,082
Hey Anne, it's Joey. I think you dialed
the wrong number or something.

1085
01:44:27,117 --> 01:44:29,175
I know, Gloria, I know.

1086
01:44:30,986 --> 01:44:32,317
Anne, is everything okay?

1087
01:44:32,654 --> 01:44:37,824
Oh yeah, absolutely. Look, Gloria,
please don't say anything.

1088
01:44:37,859 --> 01:44:43,859
I feel bad enough already. I know, I owe you. Just
please, not another word about this. You understand?

1089
01:44:44,933 --> 01:44:45,900
Not really.

1090
01:44:46,868 --> 01:44:48,995
Not another word, okay?

1091
01:44:49,704 --> 01:44:50,830
Okay.

1092
01:44:52,274 --> 01:44:54,834
Great. I owe you big time Gloria.

1093
01:45:03,051 --> 01:45:05,246
Sorry about that Eileen.

1094
01:45:05,887 --> 01:45:10,892
Some people, there's an expiration
date on forgiveness you know,

1095
01:45:10,927 --> 01:45:13,026
so I had to call when I remembered.

1096
01:45:13,061 --> 01:45:17,198
No Blake, it's just this time.
Jamie's gonna be first mate just this time.

1097
01:45:17,233 --> 01:45:18,767
How come you're always the captain?

1098
01:45:18,802 --> 01:45:19,868
Do you want to be captain?

1099
01:45:19,903 --> 01:45:20,567
Yeah!

1100
01:45:20,602 --> 01:45:22,570
Okay, then what's this part of the ship?

1101
01:45:22,871 --> 01:45:24,004
What do you mean?

1102
01:45:24,039 --> 01:45:26,541
I mean what do you call this part of the ship?

1103
01:45:26,576 --> 01:45:27,508
I don't know.

1104
01:45:28,710 --> 01:45:30,779
How can you be captain if you don't know?

1105
01:45:30,814 --> 01:45:31,745
I don't know.

1106
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:35,739
A captain has to know, Blake.
But don't feel bad, okay?

1107
01:45:35,884 --> 01:45:38,512
I値l teach you, and then you'll know next time.

1108
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:40,555
This is the bow.

1109
01:45:40,590 --> 01:45:41,922
Okay bow.

1110
01:45:41,957 --> 01:45:46,962
The back is the stern. This side is port.
And this side is starboard, got it?

1111
01:45:46,997 --> 01:45:48,797
Okay. Can I try now?

1112
01:45:48,832 --> 01:45:49,764
Okay, go.

1113
01:45:50,231 --> 01:45:52,483
Bow. And what's the back again?

1114
01:45:52,518 --> 01:45:54,701
Stern, Blake. Chip just told you!

1115
01:45:54,736 --> 01:45:57,637
Port. And starboard. Okay, I知 captain now!

1116
01:47:25,593 --> 01:47:26,787
This about your kid?

1117
01:47:31,266 --> 01:47:32,790
Marge told me.

1118
01:47:36,838 --> 01:47:38,237
You going to be okay?

1119
01:47:46,614 --> 01:47:48,047
Found a lawyer yet?

1120
01:47:49,084 --> 01:47:49,914
No.

1121
01:47:54,956 --> 01:47:59,518
Can I see your list?
Marge said you had a list of folks.

1122
01:48:35,730 --> 01:48:38,790
Doesn't this just read like
the Book of Revelation?

1123
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:52,569
Alright Joey, you got yourself a lawyer.

1124
01:48:54,816 --> 01:48:55,578
You?

1125
01:48:55,984 --> 01:48:56,780
Me.

1126
01:48:58,286 --> 01:48:59,583
I thought you were retired.

1127
01:49:00,121 --> 01:49:02,783
Hell, you're only retired till you're not.

1128
01:49:08,596 --> 01:49:09,864
You want a lawyer or not?

1129
01:49:09,899 --> 01:49:10,830
Yeah.

1130
01:49:10,865 --> 01:49:12,594
Alright, you got one.

1131
01:49:23,311 --> 01:49:28,616
I don't know Paul, there's a lot
of smart people on that list...

1132
01:49:28,651 --> 01:49:30,584
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

1133
01:49:33,555 --> 01:49:36,115
Well, uh, there's a lot of people on that list,

1134
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:40,585
and they seem to be telling the same story.

1135
01:49:42,297 --> 01:49:46,529
I don't know much about law,
but when I try to read up on stuff,

1136
01:49:47,569 --> 01:49:49,264
it also sounds like the same story.

1137
01:49:51,639 --> 01:49:54,972
Seems like I can make a big huff
and cause some trouble, but uh,

1138
01:49:56,578 --> 01:49:58,705
none of it leads to Chip coming home.

1139
01:50:06,821 --> 01:50:09,187
Joey Williams, can I say something?

1140
01:50:12,227 --> 01:50:18,188
Let me just say how glad
I am that I致e taken you on as a client.

1141
01:50:20,568 --> 01:50:22,559
You are, in fact, my favorite kind of client.

1142
01:50:24,572 --> 01:50:28,565
I have a feeling you'll actually listen to me.

1143
01:50:30,078 --> 01:50:33,707
You are the kind of client who will actually
listen to what I知 about to tell you

1144
01:50:36,017 --> 01:50:39,214
and take it to heart. You ready for this?

1145
01:50:39,921 --> 01:50:41,582
Yeah, you got my attention.

1146
01:50:46,261 --> 01:50:47,751
Joey, I am old,

1147
01:50:49,297 --> 01:50:52,755
and I have spent most of my life
doing the same damn thing,

1148
01:50:53,801 --> 01:50:57,862
which is too bad for me, but it's good for you.

1149
01:50:58,573 --> 01:51:02,873
Because I致e learned a little something
about legal affairs that you should know.

1150
01:51:04,979 --> 01:51:05,877
Alright?

1151
01:51:10,151 --> 01:51:14,110
First, just because the law has limits,

1152
01:51:15,590 --> 01:51:20,289
it does not mean that it is our job to
push up against and test those limits.

1153
01:51:21,596 --> 01:51:23,291
Those limits can be distracting.

1154
01:51:24,332 --> 01:51:27,062
So don't head straight for them.

1155
01:51:28,903 --> 01:51:33,033
Keep an open mind about where you're
going to put your energy, okay?

1156
01:51:34,309 --> 01:51:35,276
Okay.

1157
01:51:36,311 --> 01:51:38,541
And number two,

1158
01:51:40,148 --> 01:51:46,148
just because the law has limits, does not
mean our lives have those same limits.

1159
01:51:47,655 --> 01:51:49,953
Lawyers live in courtrooms, you don't have to.

1160
01:51:51,159 --> 01:51:53,821
The limits of the law apply in court.

1161
01:51:55,596 --> 01:51:56,961
But when you're out of court,

1162
01:51:57,765 --> 01:52:01,257
when the person across the
table is no longer an adversary,

1163
01:52:02,337 --> 01:52:04,134
a lot more is possible.

1164
01:52:09,177 --> 01:52:10,838
That's uh...

1165
01:52:12,847 --> 01:52:14,940
that's a different way of thinking about all this.

1166
01:52:18,886 --> 01:52:19,978
I just...

1167
01:52:21,856 --> 01:52:25,019
I can't see how me and the family get to
talking again after all this.

1168
01:52:27,628 --> 01:52:28,686
Well...

1169
01:52:30,331 --> 01:52:34,095
there may be a way for the
law to help you get to that point

1170
01:52:34,130 --> 01:52:37,860
when the person across the
table is no longer an adversary.

1171
01:52:41,676 --> 01:52:43,701
That I haven't heard before.

1172
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:47,272
Maybe I should put this down.

1173
01:52:51,352 --> 01:52:52,979
I値l write it down for you.

1174
01:52:57,258 --> 01:52:59,226
And I値l write down your homework.

1175
01:53:03,664 --> 01:53:05,291
So here's what you need, Joey.

1176
01:53:06,868 --> 01:53:10,304
You are not going to read case history.

1177
01:53:11,773 --> 01:53:16,039
You've got to figure out what's
important here, regardless of the law.

1178
01:53:17,045 --> 01:53:18,740
Forget the law.

1179
01:53:20,882 --> 01:53:22,315
What's really important

1180
01:53:24,318 --> 01:53:28,277
to change in your life,

1181
01:53:29,924 --> 01:53:32,324
what don't you want to

1182
01:53:33,995 --> 01:53:34,893
disturb,

1183
01:53:38,766 --> 01:53:42,133
and what you're ready to give up.

1184
01:53:49,944 --> 01:53:54,745
And once you've got that sorted out,
really think about

1185
01:53:55,016 --> 01:53:57,917
who or what is in your way.

1186
01:54:00,855 --> 01:54:03,050
Live with these questions a while.

1187
01:54:04,659 --> 01:54:09,596
They sound easy, but they'll stir up a big mess.

1188
01:54:10,865 --> 01:54:13,993
And you値l just have to go
over them again and again

1189
01:54:15,303 --> 01:54:16,964
until you've mastered the mess.

1190
01:54:19,607 --> 01:54:21,575
Then we talk, okay?

1191
01:54:21,843 --> 01:54:22,810
Okay.

1192
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:27,078
And then

1193
01:54:28,116 --> 01:54:33,076
I get to figure out how the law fits
into all these things you've figured out.

1194
01:54:33,855 --> 01:54:35,083
Okay.

1195
01:54:36,290 --> 01:54:39,088
So, no answers today.

1196
01:54:40,128 --> 01:54:41,095
Yeah.

1197
01:54:43,631 --> 01:54:47,761
And it may take a while, just us figuring it all out,

1198
01:54:49,036 --> 01:54:51,766
before we file a single piece of paper.

1199
01:54:52,140 --> 01:54:52,840
Yeah.

1200
01:54:52,874 --> 01:54:53,975
You're alright with that?

1201
01:54:54,010 --> 01:54:54,942
Yeah.

1202
01:54:55,543 --> 01:54:56,475
Alright.

1203
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:26,824
Hey!

1204
01:57:28,863 --> 01:57:30,455
So I guess this is it, huh?

1205
01:57:32,867 --> 01:57:35,165
We better have a beer or
something to celebrate, yeah?

1206
01:57:36,070 --> 01:57:36,770
Yeah?

1207
01:58:13,874 --> 01:58:17,537
Who would have thought George
the mailman would be the one to miss me?

1208
01:58:18,279 --> 01:58:23,478
That man sure knows how to say goodbye,
over and over again.

1209
01:58:24,118 --> 01:58:26,518
Oh thanks. And uh, here you go.

1210
01:58:26,687 --> 01:58:29,850
Sorry, I知 probably breaking
all kinds of laws, but here you go.

1211
01:58:41,302 --> 01:58:42,929
Oh. Thanks.

1212
01:58:51,779 --> 01:58:52,871
Well,

1213
01:58:55,416 --> 01:58:56,508
place looks great.

1214
01:59:00,421 --> 01:59:01,589
I can hardly get over it.

1215
01:59:01,624 --> 01:59:02,556
Yeah.

1216
01:59:03,124 --> 01:59:04,386
Turned out pretty nice.

1217
01:59:04,558 --> 01:59:06,427
Oh and Chip loves his crib by the way.

1218
01:59:06,462 --> 01:59:07,429
Yeah?

1219
01:59:07,464 --> 01:59:08,413
Oh yeah.

1220
01:59:08,448 --> 01:59:09,363
Good.

1221
01:59:10,765 --> 01:59:14,132
Yeah, I can go a little stir crazy...

1222
01:59:14,969 --> 01:59:17,130
when everyone else around
me is doing something, and I知 not.

1223
01:59:19,507 --> 01:59:23,677
You know, the crib was all left
over pieces from Casey's project too.

1224
01:59:23,712 --> 01:59:24,678
Oh no kidding?

1225
01:59:24,713 --> 01:59:25,645
Yeah.

1226
01:59:28,315 --> 01:59:30,476
He would have thrown away
a crib and not even known.

1227
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:38,490
So, is Chip uh...

1228
01:59:39,527 --> 01:59:41,154
No, he's not here now.

1229
01:59:42,029 --> 01:59:47,160
He's with my folks, which helps,
you know, having a day off now and then.

1230
01:59:51,605 --> 01:59:52,673
He's a good kid.

1231
01:59:52,708 --> 01:59:53,765
Yeah.

1232
01:59:56,510 --> 01:59:59,213
He's got lots of personality
for a little thing, don't he?

1233
01:59:59,248 --> 02:00:00,180
Oh yeah.

1234
02:00:08,522 --> 02:00:09,420
Well...

1235
02:00:11,325 --> 02:00:12,986
I wanna thank you, Joey.

1236
02:00:14,628 --> 02:00:20,628
I really do. For the crib, of course, and...

1237
02:00:22,536 --> 02:00:24,436
Well, but for more than that, for...

1238
02:00:28,843 --> 02:00:30,640
for helping hold it all together here.

1239
02:00:34,515 --> 02:00:38,042
'Cause uh... you know, Chip and I...

1240
02:00:47,695 --> 02:00:50,493
It痴 just that your being here it's, it's been uh...

1241
02:00:57,037 --> 02:01:02,407
I don't know what the hell I知 trying to say. I guess
I知 trying to say thank you. You've done a good job.

1242
02:01:04,044 --> 02:01:05,568
Well you're welcome. Yeah?

1243
02:01:09,350 --> 02:01:12,649
Alright George, what'd you bring me?
No thank you.

1244
02:01:17,091 --> 02:01:18,371
I know what this is.

1245
02:01:18,406 --> 02:01:19,652
Yeah? What is it?

1246
02:01:20,027 --> 02:01:21,392
You ever hear of Chip Taylor?

1247
02:01:22,229 --> 02:01:23,491
Sounds kind of familiar.

1248
02:01:23,697 --> 02:01:24,497
He's the guy that wrote...

1249
02:01:24,532 --> 02:01:25,933
Oh, the guy who wrote ''Wild Thing.''

1250
02:01:25,968 --> 02:01:27,452
You know Chip Taylor?

1251
02:01:27,487 --> 02:01:28,901
Just that one song.

1252
02:01:28,936 --> 02:01:32,940
Oh well, this man has written so much stuff,
so much great stuff.

1253
02:01:32,975 --> 02:01:34,999
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1254
02:01:37,244 --> 02:01:40,047
He did this album, right, with like this
girl on the cover holding a fiddle.

1255
02:01:40,082 --> 02:01:41,014
Carrie Rodriguez.

1256
02:01:41,815 --> 02:01:43,116
Yeah, I think that's it.

1257
02:01:43,151 --> 02:01:44,417
Oh that's definitely it.

1258
02:01:45,252 --> 02:01:46,412
Absolutely.

1259
02:01:47,454 --> 02:01:50,912
So, uh, during the time they'd
been making all those albums,

1260
02:01:51,258 --> 02:01:53,749
he and Carrie, they were duet albums.

1261
02:01:54,228 --> 02:01:57,527
And this is his first solo record after that.

1262
02:01:58,566 --> 02:02:04,300
And because he'd written so many songs during the time that
they were a duo that really didn't make sense for them as duets,

1263
02:02:04,605 --> 02:02:08,405
they had to make this into
a double CD. And it's just

1264
02:02:09,443 --> 02:02:13,147
brilliant, man, just so much
great stuff, like he'll...

1265
02:02:13,182 --> 02:02:15,449
Wait. You know the songs already?

1266
02:02:15,484 --> 02:02:16,416
Oh yeah.

1267
02:02:16,750 --> 02:02:18,411
On the CD you just got in the mail?

1268
02:02:18,586 --> 02:02:21,555
Well I needed a new copy.
I gave the other one to my mom.

1269
02:02:24,959 --> 02:02:25,721
What's so funny about that?

1270
02:02:28,662 --> 02:02:29,924
No. I...

1271
02:02:32,499 --> 02:02:35,900
Okay then, you're gonna
have to listen to this. C'mon.

1272
02:02:36,503 --> 02:02:38,095
You're gonna want one for yourself.

1273
02:02:38,939 --> 02:02:42,670
And since you laughed at me,
I ain't gonna special order it for you.

1274
02:02:45,279 --> 02:02:48,908
No one laughs at Chip Taylor in my house.
I don't care how much of the house you built.

1275
02:02:51,285 --> 02:02:53,954
Oh God. I hate this stuff.

1276
02:02:53,989 --> 02:02:54,620
Uh...

1277
02:02:54,655 --> 02:02:55,917
No, I got it, I got it.

1278
02:02:59,526 --> 02:03:00,458
Alright...

1279
02:03:01,495 --> 02:03:03,224
So many great songs on this.

1280
02:03:09,536 --> 02:03:11,697
That's not one of'em. Hold on.

1281
02:03:13,273 --> 02:03:14,331
There you go.

1282
02:03:18,512 --> 02:03:22,312
You just throw little darts

1283
02:03:23,150 --> 02:03:27,211
They keep on hurting me

1284
02:03:27,855 --> 02:03:31,689
All that pain and still it's free

1285
02:03:32,860 --> 02:03:35,226
What a lucky guy

1286
02:03:36,864 --> 02:03:41,426
You just say little things

1287
02:03:42,670 --> 02:03:46,231
Mixed with lies of wanderings

1288
02:03:47,074 --> 02:03:51,238
I know they're just little things

1289
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:55,331
But they hurt me big time

1290
02:03:55,366 --> 02:03:58,584
And then I watch you walk

1291
02:04:00,454 --> 02:04:04,788
And I like the way you walk

1292
02:04:05,259 --> 02:04:08,126
And I want something

1293
02:04:09,463 --> 02:04:12,432
I want it all the time

1294
02:04:29,850 --> 02:04:32,614
I知 sorry about that. I didn't mean to. I didn't know...

1295
02:04:36,657 --> 02:04:38,454
Wasn't expecting that.

1296
02:04:43,464 --> 02:04:45,489
Yeah, I don't quite know what happened there.

1297
02:04:47,468 --> 02:04:49,993
This Chip Taylor really gets a hold of you, huh?

1298
02:04:50,771 --> 02:04:51,931
I guess so.

1299
02:04:55,776 --> 02:05:00,941
Yeah. We actually named Chip after him.
I mean, my Chip's named after this one

1300
02:05:04,184 --> 02:05:05,242
Yup.

1301
02:05:05,986 --> 02:05:10,252
I remember Rebecca didn't even put up
a fight about it. She knew better.

1302
02:05:16,797 --> 02:05:18,565
I知 sorry about that, I didn't...

1303
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:19,532
Hey...

1304
02:05:23,737 --> 02:05:25,204
I知 not complaining.

1305
02:05:28,842 --> 02:05:30,503
No complaints here, Cody.

1306
02:05:41,989 --> 02:05:44,514
Hold on a second, Cody. Yeah?

1307
02:05:44,658 --> 02:05:46,956
Just what kind of cheap date you take me for?

1308
02:05:48,195 --> 02:05:50,823
Yeah don't think this is
gonna be another one of your...

1309
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:55,668
your one beer, two track romances.

1310
02:06:02,709 --> 02:06:05,644
C'mon. You gottta take me out on
the town, spin me around a little.

1311
02:06:12,085 --> 02:06:14,053
Yeah, you might want a...

1312
02:06:14,288 --> 02:06:15,721
Smart ass.

1313
02:06:21,528 --> 02:06:24,497
Okay, let's go. I just don't know
what I知 getting myself into here.

1314
02:07:12,779 --> 02:07:13,479
Morning, Joey.

1315
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:14,644
Morning.

1316
02:07:15,515 --> 02:07:16,641
You ready for this?

1317
02:07:17,317 --> 02:07:18,147
Yeah.

1318
02:07:19,186 --> 02:07:20,551
Now remember,

1319
02:07:21,688 --> 02:07:23,952
they'll say whatever.

1320
02:07:24,324 --> 02:07:27,919
Awful things. But none of that matters.

1321
02:07:28,662 --> 02:07:32,621
What matters is at the end of it all,
you get your turn to talk.

1322
02:07:33,166 --> 02:07:34,133
And they'll be there?

1323
02:07:34,668 --> 02:07:35,930
They'll be there.

1324
02:07:41,375 --> 02:07:46,472
Uh, Paul Hawks for Lee Simons at Myers.

1325
02:08:05,699 --> 02:08:06,666
He know you're coming?

1326
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,629
He knows. Lee Simons.

1327
02:08:19,680 --> 02:08:20,840
People here to see you.

1328
02:08:23,550 --> 02:08:24,642
Alright.

1329
02:08:27,587 --> 02:08:29,145

1330
02:08:30,891 --> 02:08:32,188

Morning Cheryl.

1332
02:08:34,428 --> 02:08:37,295
Paul! Where have you been hiding yourself?.

1333
02:08:38,332 --> 02:08:41,435
Oh, ya'll be in Conference Room B today.

1334

Jack doing well?

1336
02:08:45,238 --> 02:08:46,473
Much better. Thanks.

1337
02:08:46,508 --> 02:08:47,673
Tell him I say hello.

1338
02:08:47,708 --> 02:08:49,676
I will. He'll be happy to hear it.

1339
02:08:53,413 --> 02:08:54,175
Jefferson.

1340
02:08:54,514 --> 02:08:55,214
Paul.

1341
02:08:55,682 --> 02:08:57,650
Mr. Williams, Jefferson Robinson.

1342
02:08:58,218 --> 02:09:00,220
Joey, good to meet you.

1343
02:09:00,255 --> 02:09:01,186
Paul Hawks.

1344
02:09:01,221 --> 02:09:03,189
Mr. Williams, why don't you
take a seat right up here?

1345
02:09:05,692 --> 02:09:08,228
Here you go. Paul Hawks. Pleasure.

1346
02:09:08,263 --> 02:09:09,661
You alright, Mr. Williams?

1347
02:09:10,030 --> 02:09:13,600
If you'd like something to drink,
there's water and soda over there.

1348
02:09:13,635 --> 02:09:14,862
Uh no, I知 okay. Thanks.

1349
02:09:14,935 --> 02:09:16,402
Sure? Alright.

1350
02:09:16,803 --> 02:09:20,705
Any time you need a minute, you want
to take a break, just let me know.

1351
02:09:20,941 --> 02:09:22,101
Okay. Thanks.

1352
02:09:22,376 --> 02:09:25,573
Now I知 just going to wait until I get the okay
from our court reporter over there.

1353
02:09:25,946 --> 02:09:26,912
I知 ready.

1354
02:09:26,947 --> 02:09:28,915
Alright, do you want to go
ahead and swear him in?

1355
02:09:29,583 --> 02:09:31,881
Mr. Williams, could you
please raise your right hand?

1356
02:09:32,719 --> 02:09:37,679
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1357
02:09:37,991 --> 02:09:39,185
Yes, I do.

1358
02:09:39,793 --> 02:09:41,886
Great, let's go on record.

1359
02:09:42,429 --> 02:09:45,197
Mr. Williams, my name is Jefferson Robinson,

1360
02:09:45,232 --> 02:09:49,803
and I am attorney for Mrs. Eileen Robey, and I知
going to be asking you a couple questions today.

1361
02:09:49,838 --> 02:09:50,704
Alright?

1362
02:09:50,739 --> 02:09:51,536
Okay.

1363
02:09:51,571 --> 02:09:55,974
Now the first one is going to be really easy.
Could you state your full name for the record please?

1364
02:09:56,343 --> 02:09:57,776
Joey Williams.

1365
02:09:58,245 --> 02:10:01,248
Alright, Mr. Williams, now uh, have you
ever been deposed before?

1366
02:10:01,283 --> 02:10:02,650
Is this your first time?

1367
02:10:02,685 --> 02:10:03,982
Yes, this is my first time.

1368
02:10:04,017 --> 02:10:07,976
Alright, let me start off then by explaining a couple
of things that'll make today go a little smoother.

1369
02:10:08,355 --> 02:10:13,452
This is for the record, which means our court reporter will
be making a transcript of what we say here today.

1370
02:10:13,827 --> 02:10:17,409
To make sure we try and keep, um,
misunderstandings to a minimum,

1371
02:10:17,444 --> 02:10:20,991
please speak clearly so that
the court reporter can hear you.

1372
02:10:21,501 --> 02:10:24,002
Also, please let me finish
my question before you speak.

1373
02:10:24,037 --> 02:10:27,005
The reporter has a hard time
dealing with two voices at once.

1374
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:31,344
And the reporter cannot record gestures,
so please make sure you speak all your answers.

1375
02:10:31,379 --> 02:10:32,345
That all make sense?

1376
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:33,311
Yes, sir.

1377
02:10:33,346 --> 02:10:38,051
And anytime you need to confer with your lawyer,
you just let us know, and we'll go off the record.

1378
02:10:38,086 --> 02:10:39,169
Alright?

1379
02:10:39,204 --> 02:10:40,253
Okay.

1380
02:10:40,854 --> 02:10:44,813
Now, Mr. Williams, this may
be your first deposition, but...

1381
02:10:44,958 --> 02:10:50,363
I have to admit to you that this is
also my first deposition of this sort.

1382
02:10:50,398 --> 02:10:55,467
It痴 a unique set of circumstances
that's led us to this point.

1383
02:10:55,502 --> 02:11:01,502
I知 going to place before you a document
that was signed by you as well as my client.

1384
02:11:01,543 --> 02:11:03,874
Do you recognize that document, Mr. Williams?

1385
02:11:04,478 --> 02:11:06,207
You can take as long as you need to look it over.

1386
02:11:16,056 --> 02:11:18,058
Yes, I recognize it.

1387
02:11:18,093 --> 02:11:18,623
Good.

1388
02:11:18,658 --> 02:11:23,118
Now, if you don't mind, I壇 like to take just a little
time to review what's been stipulated.

1389
02:11:23,196 --> 02:11:27,496
And I mean I know the document has been executed, but
just to be clear about it all since we're all here.

1390
02:11:27,567 --> 02:11:28,768
That alright, Mr. Williams?

1391
02:11:28,803 --> 02:11:29,786
Sure.

1392
02:11:29,821 --> 02:11:30,796
Paul?

1393
02:11:30,831 --> 02:11:31,736
Go ahead.

1394
02:11:31,771 --> 02:11:34,973
Alright, so as part of this stipulation, Mr. Williams,

1395
02:11:35,008 --> 02:11:40,380
you've requested this on the record deposition
to be attended by David and Eileen Robey

1396
02:11:40,415 --> 02:11:42,382
who are both in the room now, is that correct?

1397
02:11:42,417 --> 02:11:43,713
Yes, that's right.

1398
02:11:43,850 --> 02:11:48,353
So, the agreed format for today
is that I値l ask some questions,

1399
02:11:48,388 --> 02:11:52,259
and I really don't have that many,
and then Mr. Hawks will ask some questions.

1400
02:11:52,294 --> 02:11:54,461
And then there'll be some cross
if there are any more questions.

1401
02:11:54,496 --> 02:11:55,462
Is that your understanding?

1402
02:11:55,497 --> 02:11:56,429
Yes, it is.

1403
02:11:56,763 --> 02:12:02,434
So, the requests are a little unusual,
but my client has agreed to it.

1404
02:12:02,469 --> 02:12:07,874
For your part, Mr. Williams, you've agreed
to release any claims you may have,

1405
02:12:07,909 --> 02:12:11,173
underscore may have, uh, on the home at...

1406
02:12:13,647 --> 02:12:17,139
161 Woodland Street,
the address at which you now reside.

1407
02:12:17,651 --> 02:12:18,583
Yes.

1408
02:12:18,618 --> 02:12:22,389
In addition, you release an
potential claims on bank accounts

1409
02:12:22,424 --> 02:12:25,357
or other assets that were
held by Mr. Cody Hines

1410
02:12:25,392 --> 02:12:28,495
or jointly by yourself and
Mr. Cody Hines, is that correct?

1411
02:12:28,530 --> 02:12:29,127
Yes.

1412
02:12:29,162 --> 02:12:30,462
Now, Mr. Williams,

1413
02:12:30,497 --> 02:12:34,668
you understand that the releases
you provide in this stipulation

1414
02:12:34,703 --> 02:12:37,103
go beyond this case before us

1415
02:12:37,138 --> 02:12:38,069
Yes.

1416
02:12:38,104 --> 02:12:39,264
Ah. Sorry, just a little more to the question.

1417
02:12:39,673 --> 02:12:44,276
No matter what happens in this custody case,
no matter the outcome,

1418
02:12:44,311 --> 02:12:48,873
you are releasing those claims. Now this means you
cannot claim those assets in a separate lawsuit.

1419
02:12:51,184 --> 02:12:52,751
You understand and agree with that?

1420
02:12:52,786 --> 02:12:54,953
Oh yes. Sorry,
I didn't know if you were finished.

1421
02:12:54,988 --> 02:12:59,192
No problem, and I appreciate you going
through those preliminaries with me.

1422
02:12:59,227 --> 02:13:02,494
Now, um, you answered that...

1423
02:13:02,529 --> 02:13:06,465
sorry, could the reporter read back
the statement of full name please?

1424
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:08,624
Joey Williams.

1425
02:13:09,669 --> 02:13:12,072
No middle name, Mr. Williams?

1426
02:13:12,107 --> 02:13:13,071
No, sir.

1427
02:13:13,106 --> 02:13:14,174
And you're not a Joseph?

1428
02:13:14,209 --> 02:13:16,141
No, just Joey.

1429
02:13:16,176 --> 02:13:18,406
Hm. That's a little unusual,
isn't it? How'd that happen?

1430
02:13:18,678 --> 02:13:22,414
My foster Mom and Dad called me Joey.

1431
02:13:22,449 --> 02:13:25,685
Their last name was Williams. When they
passed, I had my name changed.

1432
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:28,688
Oh, so uh Joey Williams is not your real name.

1433
02:13:28,723 --> 02:13:29,854
It is my real name.

1434
02:13:29,889 --> 02:13:32,826
Oh, sorry, it is your current legal name.

1435
02:13:32,861 --> 02:13:35,056
What was your name before?

1436
02:13:35,528 --> 02:13:37,062
Chin Mae Lang.

1437
02:13:37,097 --> 02:13:38,797
Sorry, could you spell that for me?

1438
02:13:38,832 --> 02:13:43,166
Sure. C-H-I-N. Then M-A-E. Then I-A-N-G.

1439
02:13:44,204 --> 02:13:45,470
Now um,

1440
02:13:45,505 --> 02:13:51,077
I have records of a Chin Mae Lang
in the Martin foster care system.

1441
02:13:51,112 --> 02:13:52,044
Is that you?

1442
02:13:53,413 --> 02:13:56,416
I doubt there was another. I never met another.

1443
02:13:56,451 --> 02:13:59,419
Now, are you sure? Because from what I can see,

1444
02:13:59,454 --> 02:14:02,388
this Chin Mae Lang seems to have a violent record.

1445
02:14:03,023 --> 02:14:04,489
Not sure what you mean by a violent record-

1446
02:14:04,524 --> 02:14:07,789
These records seem to show you got
into a lot of fights in foster care.

1447
02:14:09,229 --> 02:14:12,756
Mr. Williams, do you mind taking a look at this,
if it痴 okay with your counsel?

1448
02:14:14,434 --> 02:14:18,495
Take a look. If you can understand
what he's talking about, you can respond.

1449
02:14:35,488 --> 02:14:38,792
Mr. Williams, do you understand the
fights I referred to previously?

1450
02:14:38,827 --> 02:14:39,758
Yes, sir.

1451
02:14:39,793 --> 02:14:41,385
Great, so I値l ask you again.

1452
02:14:41,795 --> 02:14:45,932
Did you have a violent record
while you were in the foster care system?

1453
02:14:45,967 --> 02:14:46,899
No, sir.

1454
02:14:48,335 --> 02:14:51,571
I知 sorry Mr. Williams,
that file refers to you, yes?

1455
02:14:51,606 --> 02:14:52,203
Yes.

1456
02:14:52,238 --> 02:14:54,007
And it describes fights, yes?

1457
02:14:54,042 --> 02:14:54,974
Yes.

1458
02:14:55,809 --> 02:14:58,910
Could the court reporter please
read back the original question?

1459
02:14:58,945 --> 02:15:04,945
So, I値l ask you again, did you have a violent record
while you were in the foster care system.

1460
02:15:06,519 --> 02:15:08,188
Mr. Williams, is your answer still no?

1461
02:15:08,223 --> 02:15:09,155
It痴 still no.

1462
02:15:10,523 --> 02:15:13,291
Okay, maybe I知 not being clear. I-

1463
02:15:13,326 --> 02:15:16,161
This is about fights I had when I was 12 and 13,

1464
02:15:16,196 --> 02:15:19,764
in the orphan home. You know, after
that they moved me into foster care.

1465
02:15:19,799 --> 02:15:23,758
I didn't have any fights when I was
in foster care, or living with the Williams, or after.

1466
02:15:25,605 --> 02:15:26,765
But you did change your name?

1467
02:15:27,207 --> 02:15:28,106
Yes.

1468
02:15:28,141 --> 02:15:31,110
To separate yourself from this history of violence.

1469
02:15:34,514 --> 02:15:37,108
Mr. Robinson, I was 16.

1470
02:15:38,151 --> 02:15:40,618
I don't remember all that much from then, but

1471
02:15:40,653 --> 02:15:44,612
I知 pretty sure I wasn't spending a whole lot of time
regretting punches I threw when I was 12,

1472
02:15:45,525 --> 02:15:47,288
or thinking about the future, you know.

1473
02:15:48,128 --> 02:15:51,331
I知 pretty sure changing my name had
something to do with my mom and dad just dying.

1474
02:15:51,366 --> 02:15:53,229
Your foster mother and father.

1475
02:15:53,264 --> 02:15:55,093
My foster mother and father.

1476
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:03,721
A lot of people seem to die around you,
don't they Mr. Williams?

1477
02:16:03,756 --> 02:16:07,202
And a lot of people seem to puke around you,
don't they Jefferson?

1478
02:16:07,647 --> 02:16:09,013
Can we move on?

1479
02:16:09,048 --> 02:16:11,107
I知 just trying to understand some history.

1480
02:16:11,518 --> 02:16:14,885
Alright. Let's keep it to that.

1481
02:16:16,489 --> 02:16:19,709
Mr. Williams, you entered
the orphan home when your

1482
02:16:19,744 --> 02:16:22,929
biological family, your father,
mother and sister died.

1483
02:16:22,964 --> 02:16:23,930
Is that correct?

1484
02:16:23,965 --> 02:16:24,896
Yes.

1485
02:16:24,931 --> 02:16:27,934
And then your foster mother
and foster father died too. Yes?

1486
02:16:27,969 --> 02:16:28,866
Yes.

1487
02:16:29,335 --> 02:16:30,461
And did you know Rebecca Hines?

1488
02:16:30,703 --> 02:16:31,803
Yes.

1489
02:16:31,838 --> 02:16:35,742
So Rebecca and Cody Hines too
have died since you've known them.

1490
02:16:35,777 --> 02:16:36,709
Yes.

1491
02:16:38,745 --> 02:16:40,747
That's a lot of people to die in someone's life.

1492
02:16:40,782 --> 02:16:41,805
Yes.

1493
02:16:42,949 --> 02:16:45,852
And you think Chip would be safe with you?

1494
02:16:45,887 --> 02:16:46,819
Yes.

1495
02:16:49,556 --> 02:16:53,822
Mr. Williams, how long were
you at the Williams' home?

1496
02:16:54,627 --> 02:16:57,063
Uh... two and a half years.

1497
02:16:57,098 --> 02:16:58,064
That's it?

1498
02:16:58,099 --> 02:16:59,031
Yes.

1499
02:16:59,466 --> 02:17:01,768
Seems like they made quite
an impression in two and a half years.

1500
02:17:01,803 --> 02:17:03,030
Yes, they did.

1501
02:17:03,403 --> 02:17:06,372
And how old were you when
your biological family died?

1502
02:17:06,639 --> 02:17:07,731
Three.

1503
02:17:08,475 --> 02:17:14,475
So, other than about 5 years of your life,
you've not had a father and a mother.

1504
02:17:14,582 --> 02:17:15,914
That's right.

1505
02:17:15,949 --> 02:17:19,619
And you in fact did not have
any family outside those 5 years.

1506
02:17:19,654 --> 02:17:20,620
Well that's not right.

1507
02:17:20,655 --> 02:17:21,586
No?

1508
02:17:21,621 --> 02:17:22,588
There's Cody and Chip.

1509
02:17:22,655 --> 02:17:23,621
Okay.

1510
02:17:23,656 --> 02:17:25,492
And Dave and Eileen and Blake...

1511
02:17:25,527 --> 02:17:25,924
Ah, sure.

1512
02:17:25,959 --> 02:17:26,926
Sally and Darryl.

1513
02:17:28,294 --> 02:17:31,923
Let's talk for a minute about Cody Hines.

1514
02:17:34,968 --> 02:17:37,937
How exactly did you seduce him?

1515
02:17:38,505 --> 02:17:39,871
Excuse me?

1516
02:17:39,906 --> 02:17:41,533
How did you seduce Cody Hines?

1517
02:17:42,675 --> 02:17:45,371
I did not seduce Cody Hines.

1518
02:17:45,778 --> 02:17:50,583
Cody Hines did not engage in any deviant
sexual behavior before he met you, did he?

1519
02:17:50,618 --> 02:17:54,485
I object. On behalf of the civilized world.

1520
02:17:55,288 --> 02:17:58,917
Can we keep away from conjecture
and compound questions?

1521
02:17:59,526 --> 02:18:04,463
Mr. Williams, as far as you knew, did
Cody Hines sleep with men before he met you?

1522
02:18:04,864 --> 02:18:06,265
As far as I know, no.

1523
02:18:06,300 --> 02:18:07,667
But he slept with you?

1524
02:18:07,702 --> 02:18:08,633
Yes.

1525
02:18:08,668 --> 02:18:11,304
And this started when
Rebecca was pregnant with Chip?

1526
02:18:11,339 --> 02:18:12,270
No.

1527
02:18:12,305 --> 02:18:13,306
Oh this happened after Chip was born?

1528
02:18:13,341 --> 02:18:14,273
Yes.

1529
02:18:14,674 --> 02:18:15,875
After Rebecca died?

1530
02:18:15,910 --> 02:18:16,574
Yes.

1531
02:18:16,609 --> 02:18:17,610
Right after?

1532
02:18:17,645 --> 02:18:18,076
No.

1533
02:18:18,111 --> 02:18:19,169
How long after?

1534
02:18:19,812 --> 02:18:22,576
Uh... about seven months.

1535
02:18:25,018 --> 02:18:30,581
Mr. Williams, is it possible to get over the death
of a loved one in seven months?

1536
02:18:31,691 --> 02:18:32,487
I guess.

1537
02:18:33,793 --> 02:18:35,158
Have you gotten over the death of Cody?

1538
02:18:37,397 --> 02:18:38,625
No.

1539
02:18:39,198 --> 02:18:41,359
Been about seven months, right?

1540
02:18:42,201 --> 02:18:43,167
Yes.

1541
02:18:43,202 --> 02:18:45,170
And you, you're not over him yet?

1542
02:18:45,505 --> 02:18:46,371
No.

1543
02:18:46,406 --> 02:18:47,634
You don't have another boyfriend?

1544
02:18:48,074 --> 02:18:48,836
Nope.

1545
02:18:51,811 --> 02:18:52,971
Mr. Williams,

1546
02:18:53,580 --> 02:18:58,643
Cody Hines had never been with a man
before you. Why did he choose you?

1547
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:01,980
I don't know.

1548
02:19:03,323 --> 02:19:04,691
How did you seduce him?

1549
02:19:04,726 --> 02:19:05,658
I didn't.

1550
02:19:05,725 --> 02:19:10,730
You didn't take advantage of his, his confusion of his
mourning his recently deceased bride.

1551
02:19:10,765 --> 02:19:13,790
No. I listened to him was all,

1552
02:19:14,834 --> 02:19:16,734
when he needed it. I talked to him.

1553
02:19:18,538 --> 02:19:19,772
And I didn't ask him for anything.

1554
02:19:19,807 --> 02:19:21,908
Oh, except a paycheck.

1555
02:19:21,943 --> 02:19:22,507
No.

1556
02:19:22,542 --> 02:19:24,043
No? You were working for him, right?

1557
02:19:24,078 --> 02:19:25,544
Yes, but I didn't get a paycheck.

1558
02:19:28,114 --> 02:19:32,551
You know, when Rebecca died,
I just felt awful for Cody.

1559
02:19:33,419 --> 02:19:36,688
And I really liked Rebecca too, you know. And

1560
02:19:36,723 --> 02:19:42,428
I had these other jobs at the time that were paying me fine,
so I, I just billed through other folks' costs on Cody's project.

1561
02:19:42,463 --> 02:19:44,760
I didn't take any money
from him during that time.

1562
02:19:45,031 --> 02:19:46,331
And did he know this?

1563
02:19:46,366 --> 02:19:48,199
I don't know. I can't speak for him.

1564
02:19:48,234 --> 02:19:50,401
And you don't seem to be
able to speak of him either.

1565
02:19:50,436 --> 02:19:53,573
You didn't say anything at Cody Hines'
service did you, Mr. Williams?

1566
02:19:53,608 --> 02:19:54,105
No, I-

1567
02:19:54,140 --> 02:19:57,166
Now Mr. Williams, you...
you're not a pedophile, are you?

1568
02:19:57,910 --> 02:19:59,172
No.

1569
02:19:59,579 --> 02:20:02,915
If I were to look through your criminal history,
I wouldn't find any charges?

1570
02:20:02,950 --> 02:20:05,884
Under your name or any
other name you've assumed?

1571
02:20:07,253 --> 02:20:08,777
No.

1572
02:20:12,625 --> 02:20:15,890
Well thank you, Mr. Williams.
That's all the questions I have.

1573
02:20:54,333 --> 02:20:58,235
Joey, you may only have had a mother and father
for a couple of years, but

1574
02:20:59,038 --> 02:21:02,906
it looks like they at least taught
you some manners in that time.

1575
02:21:03,276 --> 02:21:04,470
Yes, they did.

1576
02:21:06,512 --> 02:21:11,006
Now Joey, I知 going to back us up a little bit

1577
02:21:11,651 --> 02:21:13,118
to where Mr...

1578
02:21:15,488 --> 02:21:18,821
Robinson started the deposition.

1579
02:21:19,959 --> 02:21:25,031
Do you remember him talking about a document
you signed and about you giving up the house?

1580
02:21:25,066 --> 02:21:26,197
Yes, I do.

1581
02:21:26,232 --> 02:21:27,859
And it seems like

1582
02:21:28,901 --> 02:21:32,203
you gave up your claims to the house

1583
02:21:32,238 --> 02:21:38,199
and to your accounts with
Cody in exchange for a deposition.

1584
02:21:39,045 --> 02:21:39,807
Now,

1585
02:21:41,347 --> 02:21:44,612
I love a good deposition
as much as the next lawyer,

1586
02:21:45,518 --> 02:21:49,614
but this is a surprising trade. And it sounds like

1587
02:21:51,257 --> 02:21:53,691
Mr. Robinson was surprised too.

1588
02:21:55,161 --> 02:21:58,688
Could you tell us why you decided to do this?

1589
02:22:00,933 --> 02:22:01,699
Okay.

1590
02:22:01,734 --> 02:22:02,735
It痴 a big question.

1591
02:22:02,770 --> 02:22:03,736
Yeah.

1592
02:22:03,771 --> 02:22:04,703
But

1593
02:22:05,438 --> 02:22:10,705
I think it'll help Jefferson and Eileen
and Dave understand why they're here.

1594
02:22:13,179 --> 02:22:15,807
Okay. Yeah, okay.

1595
02:22:19,552 --> 02:22:23,010
So uh... I致e been thinking.

1596
02:22:24,190 --> 02:22:28,718
You know, being on my own now. With
the house so quiet. With, with all this time.

1597
02:22:30,763 --> 02:22:35,029
I致e been thinking, how'd we ever get here.

1598
02:22:36,469 --> 02:22:40,530
You know, how'd things
ever get to the point they did.

1599
02:22:42,642 --> 02:22:48,012
And how'd they happen so fast, you know. It seems
like one day I was Chip's dad, Blake's Uncle Joey.

1600
02:22:48,748 --> 02:22:51,410
Then all of a sudden I知 Mr. Joey Williams on a police form.

1601
02:22:51,951 --> 02:22:54,419
I致e been trying to think what exactly happened.

1602
02:22:55,454 --> 02:22:58,218
Sorry, it'll probably take me a while to get at your question.

1603
02:22:58,558 --> 02:23:02,517
That's fine, Joey. That's fine,
you take all the time you need.

1604
02:23:04,564 --> 02:23:05,724
Well at the beginning,

1605
02:23:07,567 --> 02:23:09,728
all I wanted was to get Chip back.

1606
02:23:11,771 --> 02:23:15,434
And I was angry, so I wasn't one to think straight.

1607
02:23:16,576 --> 02:23:21,280
Now I look back, and all the times I tried
to get through to Dave, Eileen or Sally...

1608
02:23:21,315 --> 02:23:24,374
I was pretty much screaming my head off.

1609
02:23:26,152 --> 02:23:31,112
Even that first night Eileen told me
about Cody's will, I got a little hotheaded.

1610
02:23:31,357 --> 02:23:35,259
And that night I took Chip away.

1611
02:23:36,963 --> 02:23:42,924
Right or wrong, it didn't help things. It didn't exactly
make me someone they wanted to come up and talk to.

1612
02:23:44,070 --> 02:23:48,837
So I guess the first thing I wanted to do
is tell Dave and tell Eileen I know I had my part

1613
02:23:49,175 --> 02:23:54,511
in the way things went bad so fast.
I知 not just mad at you, I know I had my part.

1614
02:24:00,553 --> 02:24:04,148
Okay, I think they heard you, Joey.

1615
02:24:05,691 --> 02:24:09,729
Okay, now about why
I traded all the stuff for a deposition.

1616
02:24:09,764 --> 02:24:10,696
Good.

1617
02:24:11,297 --> 02:24:12,732
You're right, it's not for love of the thing.

1618
02:24:12,767 --> 02:24:14,632
I get that feeling.

1619
02:24:15,167 --> 02:24:16,464
Am I doing that bad?

1620
02:24:17,370 --> 02:24:21,238
You're doing just fine, Joey. You're doing just fine.

1621
02:24:22,675 --> 02:24:24,336
Okay, well uh...

1622
02:24:25,077 --> 02:24:28,638
when you first said you'd be my lawyer,
you asked me a question.

1623
02:24:29,081 --> 02:24:33,916
You asked me what was really important
and what would I give up to get there.

1624
02:24:35,554 --> 02:24:36,854
And you figured it out.

1625
02:24:36,889 --> 02:24:39,357
Yeah, I figured it. It took me
a while, but I figured it out.

1626
02:24:41,527 --> 02:24:45,520
Cody kind of helped me figure it out.
Thinking about me and Cody.

1627
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:52,428
You know, we had a good life.
A really good life.

1628
02:24:53,506 --> 02:24:55,440
He knew it, I knew it, but...

1629
02:24:58,744 --> 02:25:02,441
but I guess the thing we didn't
do was talk about the big stuff.

1630
02:25:04,517 --> 02:25:10,251
Each day kind of crept up on us
and we never said big stuff.

1631
02:25:11,490 --> 02:25:13,617
Like I don't think I ever
told him how happy I was.

1632
02:25:15,661 --> 02:25:17,253
It壇 be nice if I did.

1633
02:25:18,097 --> 02:25:22,501
It壇 be nice if we talked about big
things like a life together and like wills,

1634
02:25:22,536 --> 02:25:26,270
so bad on us, you know.

1635
02:25:26,305 --> 02:25:28,637
We didn't talk about it,
so the other guy didn't know.

1636
02:25:30,776 --> 02:25:34,542
So I decided I am not going
to make the same mistake twice.

1637
02:25:35,181 --> 02:25:38,742
I am going to talk about the big stuff
in front of Dave and in front of Eileen.

1638
02:25:39,585 --> 02:25:43,612
I知 not going to assume they know what
Chip means to me. What Cody means to me.

1639
02:25:45,424 --> 02:25:46,618
So I want to tell them.

1640
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:59,438
And this is important enough,
you'll give up all that other stuff.

1641
02:25:59,473 --> 02:26:02,640
Oh, yeah. I致e uh...

1642
02:26:02,675 --> 02:26:05,405
I致e started from zero a couple times in my life.

1643
02:26:06,112 --> 02:26:08,580
Giving up these things, I知 hardly at zero.

1644
02:26:09,882 --> 02:26:12,942
But Chip is family.

1645
02:26:14,787 --> 02:26:16,448
Dave and Eileen are family.

1646
02:26:18,858 --> 02:26:22,954
I think it's more important they get
me than some judge gets me.

1647
02:26:24,497 --> 02:26:27,955
I don't know if it痴 going to happen,
but I want to give them a chance to get me.

1648
02:26:31,203 --> 02:26:35,639
So, why don't I ask a couple questions

1649
02:26:35,674 --> 02:26:38,643
about some of the stuff Jefferson mentioned?

1650
02:26:38,711 --> 02:26:41,111
Good. You're going to help me out with questions.

1651
02:26:41,146 --> 02:26:43,511
I知 going to help you out with questions, Joey.

1652
02:26:44,150 --> 02:26:45,174
Now,

1653
02:26:46,552 --> 02:26:52,224
Jefferson mentioned you didn't speak
at Cody's memorial service? Is that right?

1654
02:26:52,259 --> 02:26:55,159
No. I mean yes, that's right, I didn't speak.

1655
02:26:55,528 --> 02:26:57,519
Is there a reason why?

1656
02:26:59,398 --> 02:27:01,491
I had no idea what to say.

1657
02:27:02,902 --> 02:27:07,498
But I knew I should at least
try and say something, right?

1658
02:27:08,107 --> 02:27:10,507
I planned on talking.

1659
02:27:12,111 --> 02:27:15,393
I sort of helped Chip up to the podium,
and he went first.

1660
02:27:15,428 --> 02:27:18,676
I kind of stood with him
while he talked about his pa.

1661
02:27:20,219 --> 02:27:23,677
And Chip,

1662
02:27:23,923 --> 02:27:28,519
he was just up there telling everyone
this story and that about his pa.

1663
02:27:29,562 --> 02:27:32,087
Had everyone cracking up and bawling all at once.

1664
02:27:34,567 --> 02:27:40,062
And you know, it was the first time
all day it felt like Cody was close by.

1665
02:27:40,906 --> 02:27:44,672
When everyone else talked, it was like he
was slipping away, but Chip brought him back.

1666
02:27:46,112 --> 02:27:50,742
And I just thought it was the
right way to end things, you know.

1667
02:27:51,984 --> 02:27:53,747
Let his kid have the last word.

1668
02:27:55,788 --> 02:27:59,280
Yeah, Chip did us all a big favor that
day and I wasn't about to undo it.

1669
02:28:04,263 --> 02:28:04,963
Joey,

1670
02:28:06,332 --> 02:28:11,235
do you think you can share with
us a few words about Cody now?

1671
02:28:11,737 --> 02:28:15,229
Maybe some of the things you were
thinking about saying that day.

1672
02:28:16,342 --> 02:28:21,211
Okay. Uh...

1673
02:28:22,481 --> 02:28:25,416
I don't really remember what
I was going to say that day...

1674
02:28:26,619 --> 02:28:31,283
Why don't you just tell
us a little bit about you and Cody.

1675
02:28:31,924 --> 02:28:32,891
Okay.

1676
02:28:35,327 --> 02:28:37,887
Well uh...

1677
02:28:39,331 --> 02:28:42,596
me and Cody was pretty
much a surprise to both of us.

1678
02:28:43,702 --> 02:28:46,227
It wasn't just you guys, we were surprised too.

1679
02:28:47,506 --> 02:28:49,804
I mean, I never expected we'd get together.

1680
02:28:50,476 --> 02:28:53,809
He was just this nice guy I sort of knew, you know.

1681
02:28:54,280 --> 02:28:58,307
We got along and all. And uh...

1682
02:28:58,484 --> 02:29:03,421
I guess he had the idea first and one night he...

1683
02:29:03,822 --> 02:29:07,986
out of the blue, sort of kissed me.

1684
02:29:09,628 --> 02:29:11,186
And uh...

1685
02:29:13,699 --> 02:29:16,998
it just set something off. You know?

1686
02:29:18,470 --> 02:29:20,438
Suddenly everything was really fun.

1687
02:29:21,507 --> 02:29:26,103
And I just wanted him in every minute of my life.

1688
02:29:28,514 --> 02:29:33,816
The more I got to know him, the more I couldn't
believe I never saw all the good stuff before, you know?

1689
02:29:34,353 --> 02:29:35,877
Like um,

1690
02:29:38,257 --> 02:29:39,986
I have these musician friends,

1691
02:29:40,593 --> 02:29:45,997
but I learned more about music just
watching Cody listen to some Chip Taylor song.

1692
02:29:47,166 --> 02:29:49,191
Man, he loved his Chip Taylor.

1693
02:29:50,603 --> 02:29:54,198
Yeah, he loved his Chip Taylor, you make sure
you get that in there. He'll want that written down.

1694
02:29:56,609 --> 02:29:59,203
Oh Cody loved a lot of stuff.

1695
02:29:59,745 --> 02:30:03,511
It was kind of contagious, you know.
He saw good things in people.

1696
02:30:04,450 --> 02:30:09,410
Sometimes I don't know where he was looking,
but he convinced us it was there.

1697
02:30:12,758 --> 02:30:17,218
I think it's a little harder for us to
see some of the good stuff now.

1698
02:30:18,631 --> 02:30:20,223
Without him, I mean.

1699
02:30:24,737 --> 02:30:28,002
Yeah Cody was the guy I wanted to grow old with.

1700
02:30:30,376 --> 02:30:32,003
But uh...

1701
02:30:32,745 --> 02:30:37,205
he's also the kind of guy you
have in your life a little while,

1702
02:30:37,750 --> 02:30:40,218
and you know you're a lucky bastard.

1703
02:30:47,459 --> 02:30:48,221
Now Joey,

1704
02:30:49,962 --> 02:30:54,524
you talked a little bit about
your foster parents earlier.

1705
02:30:55,567 --> 02:30:57,432
Can you tell me more about them?

1706
02:30:58,470 --> 02:30:59,236
Sure.

1707
02:30:59,271 --> 02:31:05,271
Um... my mom, her name was Irene Williams.
My dad was Joseph Williams.

1708
02:31:05,646 --> 02:31:07,346
And that's where the Joey came from?

1709
02:31:07,381 --> 02:31:08,313
Yeah.

1710
02:31:09,748 --> 02:31:11,443
What did they do?

1711
02:31:11,750 --> 02:31:15,654
My dad, when he was younger,
he used to build boats.

1712
02:31:15,689 --> 02:31:17,622
He's originally from Louisiana.

1713
02:31:18,490 --> 02:31:22,324
As he got older, the things
he built kind of got smaller.

1714
02:31:23,095 --> 02:31:25,723
In the end he was mostly building guitars.

1715
02:31:26,965 --> 02:31:31,265
Also had a shop where he bound books.
Really good with the leather bound.

1716
02:31:32,304 --> 02:31:35,307
And he taught you how to do some of that stuff?.

1717
02:31:35,342 --> 02:31:36,473
Yeah.

1718
02:31:36,508 --> 02:31:39,272
We were kind of dangerous together.

1719
02:31:40,112 --> 02:31:42,548
You had a man who could teach you
how to make anything in the world

1720
02:31:42,583 --> 02:31:47,247
and a kid who just couldn't
get enough. It was just too cool.

1721
02:31:47,853 --> 02:31:51,290
Did you ever build a boat with your dad?

1722
02:31:51,325 --> 02:31:52,257
Yeah.

1723
02:31:53,959 --> 02:31:55,927
Not many people can say that.

1724
02:31:56,528 --> 02:32:00,328
I tell you it doesn't even begin to describe the guy.

1725
02:32:01,500 --> 02:32:06,938
He told me to call him Dad
from day one, and he lived up to it.

1726
02:32:08,674 --> 02:32:11,939
You know, growing up without a family,

1727
02:32:12,678 --> 02:32:15,145
you kind of get used to this look from grown-ups.

1728
02:32:15,180 --> 02:32:20,516
Yeah. They kind of look at you like,
what-am-I-gonna-do-with-you.

1729
02:32:22,187 --> 02:32:26,283
Dad never had that look.
He knew what he was gonna do.

1730
02:32:27,192 --> 02:32:30,218
He was going to be my dad, that was that.

1731
02:32:30,763 --> 02:32:33,231
And it was the most natural
thing in the world to him.

1732
02:32:37,569 --> 02:32:39,230
And what did your mom do?

1733
02:32:40,272 --> 02:32:46,272
Oh... she was full-time crazy.

1734
02:32:47,513 --> 02:32:52,177
But just about the most beautiful
kind of crazy you can imagine.

1735
02:32:53,018 --> 02:32:57,182
Yeah? Dad made the guitars,
and Mom had the friends to play them.

1736
02:32:57,790 --> 02:33:01,191
She loved like mountain music and dancing.

1737
02:33:01,527 --> 02:33:04,758
And with Mom, every week it was something new.

1738
02:33:05,297 --> 02:33:11,297
Yeah, you didn't know if it was going to be
Mom the writer, or Mom the archeologist, or...

1739
02:33:13,205 --> 02:33:17,938
I swear, there were a couple of months there where

1740
02:33:18,210 --> 02:33:21,611
all she did was make personalized urns.

1741
02:33:22,414 --> 02:33:27,943
Seriously, she did all this research into people's lives
after they died to make the perfect urn to fit their personality.

1742
02:33:28,654 --> 02:33:30,952
Just out of her gourd.

1743
02:33:32,424 --> 02:33:38,260
It痴 uh, it's funny, her life was all noise
and adventure and stuff, but um...

1744
02:33:39,998 --> 02:33:45,265
when it was just the two of us,
it was usually just quiet.

1745
02:33:45,604 --> 02:33:50,234
You know I, I guess everyone has to come
down a little at some point. But uh,

1746
02:33:51,643 --> 02:33:56,239
us around the house, not really doing anything.

1747
02:33:59,284 --> 02:34:02,253
I don't know why,
but that's what I think about a lot.

1748
02:34:04,490 --> 02:34:06,754
People like the crazy stories, but uh,

1749
02:34:07,793 --> 02:34:13,527
that nothing around the house stuff, um,
that's what I miss about Mom.

1750
02:34:16,602 --> 02:34:21,562
It sounds like they set a pretty
good example for you as parents.

1751
02:34:22,007 --> 02:34:23,167
They did.

1752
02:34:25,410 --> 02:34:29,540
Now. Can you tell me, Joey,

1753
02:34:32,150 --> 02:34:35,517
why you think you'll be a good father to Chip?

1754
02:34:37,556 --> 02:34:39,285
Well, uh...

1755
02:34:41,326 --> 02:34:44,295
I guess I never really had to
think about that question before.

1756
02:34:44,696 --> 02:34:47,290
Sure, I thought about how to be a good dad,

1757
02:34:47,900 --> 02:34:51,666
but I didn't spend a whole lot of time
trying to convince people I was up for it.

1758
02:34:52,571 --> 02:34:55,665
You know, I just did it. And tried to do it better.

1759
02:34:57,109 --> 02:35:01,678
Now it's like I知 interviewing

1760
02:35:01,713 --> 02:35:03,681
for the same job I had for the last six years.

1761
02:35:05,350 --> 02:35:08,376
But I致e tried to think about the question.

1762
02:35:08,587 --> 02:35:11,385
You know, take myself out of it,
and think about it seriously.

1763
02:35:12,724 --> 02:35:15,056
And I知 not about to say
I知 the world's best dad.

1764
02:35:15,761 --> 02:35:18,662
But this is what I got.

1765
02:35:20,966 --> 02:35:22,661
I got a Mom and Dad

1766
02:35:23,201 --> 02:35:27,729
who taught me how to love like a reflex. Yeah?

1767
02:35:28,307 --> 02:35:30,502
If you do it all the time, it gets easy.

1768
02:35:31,410 --> 02:35:35,506
It gets into every little thing you do,
and your kid's going to have the important stuff.

1769
02:35:37,249 --> 02:35:39,274
Cody, he taught me a lot.

1770
02:35:41,119 --> 02:35:42,586
Cody was really smart.

1771
02:35:43,055 --> 02:35:48,460
People sometimes forgot that about him 'cause he had all
this other stuff going for him, but he was crazy smart.

1772
02:35:48,495 --> 02:35:52,692
Chip's the same way. Yeah? They are
both way out of my league there, but

1773
02:35:54,333 --> 02:35:56,767
I saw how Cody taught Chip.

1774
02:35:57,436 --> 02:36:01,065
How he taught him to be creative,
find out more about stuff he liked.

1775
02:36:02,107 --> 02:36:05,770
Yeah, you live with a real
teacher like Cody and um,

1776
02:36:06,678 --> 02:36:10,409
you learn how to help people get better.
Much better than you.

1777
02:36:11,917 --> 02:36:16,980
So, I know Chip will grow up to be smarter than me,
and he'll go on to do important things.

1778
02:36:17,923 --> 02:36:21,290
But I can help him get there.
I know that's my job.

1779
02:36:23,261 --> 02:36:27,297
And uh, Chip is such a good kid,

1780
02:36:27,332 --> 02:36:31,336
there's gonna be all sorts of people
lining up to help him in his life.

1781
02:36:31,371 --> 02:36:35,295
But I知 gonna be at the
front of that line. All the time.

1782
02:36:39,311 --> 02:36:41,279
I know Dave and Eileen are in that line too.

1783
02:36:44,016 --> 02:36:45,779
They're like me, I think.

1784
02:36:47,619 --> 02:36:52,079
They really miss Cody, and they want
to make sure Chip gets the best.

1785
02:36:57,029 --> 02:37:03,029
Mr. Robinson, you're right.
I致e lost a lot of people in my life.

1786
02:37:04,703 --> 02:37:07,103
But I won't lose someone
I love if I don't have to.

1787
02:37:08,340 --> 02:37:13,107
Yeah, I won't let Chip think I stopped
loving him before I知 cold in the ground.

1788
02:37:14,913 --> 02:37:16,881
My life is all about that kid.

1789
02:37:18,717 --> 02:37:21,185
Every thing I think, he comes into the picture.

1790
02:37:22,921 --> 02:37:28,188
I致e got his college fund going. And I am going to
teach him to throw that perfect spiral.

1791
02:37:30,529 --> 02:37:34,197
He is really into dragons right now.

1792
02:37:34,232 --> 02:37:39,202
I致e got the next five lined up.
Or whatever he's into, I値l line it up.

1793
02:37:39,237 --> 02:37:44,574
And I値l make sure he gets every
Chip Taylor album, just like his pa wanted.

1794
02:37:44,609 --> 02:37:48,912
He'll do his homework, eat vegetables, all of that.
Hell, we might even build a boat together.

1795
02:37:48,947 --> 02:37:54,351
But it won't be so he can build boats all his life.
Yeah, he's going to learn to captain the boat and all.

1796
02:37:58,457 --> 02:38:01,483
I swear to you, I値l give Chip everything.

1797
02:38:03,528 --> 02:38:09,489
I will be a good dad to him.
I know how, and I will do it.

1798
02:38:12,804 --> 02:38:15,500
I raised my hand today and
swore to you I wasn't going to lie.

1799
02:38:17,542 --> 02:38:19,908
I will swear to be a good dad to him.

1800
02:38:21,546 --> 02:38:24,106
As many times as you need me to swear it.

1801
02:38:30,388 --> 02:38:33,585
Thank you, Joey. No more questions.

1802
02:38:40,632 --> 02:38:41,963
Alright.

1803
02:38:44,002 --> 02:38:48,564
Why don't we take a quick break and we'll come back
and see if we can wrap this up before long?

1804
02:38:49,608 --> 02:38:52,975
Alright, going off the record.

1805
02:38:57,749 --> 02:39:01,019
Want some coffee?
There's a kitchen around the corner.

1806
02:39:01,054 --> 02:39:03,988
Yeah, that'd be great.

1807
02:39:06,625 --> 02:39:07,959
Mind if I follow you?

1808
02:39:07,994 --> 02:39:08,925
Sure.

1809
02:39:08,960 --> 02:39:10,325
Heard about, something about coffee.

1810
02:40:05,083 --> 02:40:11,083
Um. We don't have anything else Paul,
so we're done for the day.

1811
02:40:13,258 --> 02:40:14,316
Mr. Williams.

1812
02:41:27,098 --> 02:41:28,224
Joey.

1813
02:41:28,733 --> 02:41:30,223
Hey, Dave.

1814
02:41:35,273 --> 02:41:37,475
You guys left in a hurry today.

1815
02:41:37,510 --> 02:41:38,908
Oh yeah.

1816
02:41:40,946 --> 02:41:43,608
Sorry Joey. Eileen she...

1817
02:41:47,652 --> 02:41:48,619
You know,

1818
02:41:51,489 --> 02:41:54,617
I致e been sorry about this since the start, I...

1819
02:41:59,664 --> 02:42:01,632
It was good to hear you talk.

1820
02:42:04,102 --> 02:42:05,626
We did hear you.

1821
02:42:14,479 --> 02:42:17,607
It痴 nice to be, to be talking again.

1822
02:42:24,055 --> 02:42:28,617
Yeah, we're just talking up
a storm here, aren't we Dave?

1823
02:42:32,731 --> 02:42:36,929
Yeah. Yeah.

1824
02:42:38,670 --> 02:42:43,937
I didn't know the lawyer
was going to say those things.

1825
02:42:44,175 --> 02:42:46,268
They, they were awful.

1826
02:42:49,314 --> 02:42:54,152
Eileen and me both,
we couldn't believe what he said.

1827
02:42:54,187 --> 02:42:55,119
Eileen okay?

1828
02:42:56,154 --> 02:42:58,884
Um, not really, no.

1829
02:43:00,725 --> 02:43:03,661
You all could have just talked to me
before talking to the police, Dave.

1830
02:43:03,696 --> 02:43:05,997
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know. I know.

1831
02:43:06,032 --> 02:43:11,162
And I, I think Eileen knows that too.

1832
02:43:14,205 --> 02:43:16,036
You were right,

1833
02:43:17,776 --> 02:43:20,040
what you said, we have all been...

1834
02:43:21,780 --> 02:43:24,044
we've been confused since Cody.

1835
02:43:26,084 --> 02:43:26,846
But she's,

1836
02:43:29,220 --> 02:43:31,388
she's really been working hard to figure this out.

1837
02:43:31,423 --> 02:43:35,393
She's trying real hard. Now I don't
know if you believe it, but she is.

1838
02:43:35,428 --> 02:43:36,359
I believe you, Dave.

1839
02:43:36,394 --> 02:43:38,362
She, she's just trying to figure it out.

1840
02:43:41,199 --> 02:43:42,359
She know you're here?

1841
02:43:43,468 --> 02:43:44,594
Yeah, she's in the car.

1842
02:43:55,480 --> 02:43:57,380
She's not going to come out and talk to me?

1843
02:43:59,184 --> 02:44:04,383
I don't know. She don't know.

1844
02:44:06,424 --> 02:44:10,383
But she, she wanted to let you know, uh,

1845
02:44:11,096 --> 02:44:15,590
this is from her now, you don't have to move.

1846
02:44:18,970 --> 02:44:22,974
I know we signed whatever, but this is your place.

1847
02:44:23,009 --> 02:44:25,340
She's got that much figured out.

1848
02:44:28,580 --> 02:44:30,445
Still don't know what to do about uh...

1849
02:44:31,182 --> 02:44:32,945
about everything else, but uh,

1850
02:44:34,519 --> 02:44:36,077
you'll give her some time, yeah?

1851
02:44:38,123 --> 02:44:40,090
She's not like she was where she's saying,

1852
02:44:40,125 --> 02:44:46,125
This is how it is. She, uh, she really doesn't know.

1853
02:44:46,432 --> 02:44:47,915
Yeah?

1854
02:44:47,950 --> 02:44:49,398
Yeah.

1855
02:44:53,004 --> 02:44:55,707
Dave, you can tell her, tell her I-

1856
02:44:55,742 --> 02:44:57,640
Oh hell, this is ridiculous.

1857
02:44:57,675 --> 02:45:02,703
Eileen! Eileen, get out here and talk to Joey!

1858
02:45:18,696 --> 02:45:20,765
Daddy! Surprise!

1859
02:45:20,800 --> 02:45:22,165
Chip!

1860
02:45:22,200 --> 02:45:24,168
Hope you don't mind a guest tonight.
