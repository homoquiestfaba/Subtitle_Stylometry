00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,500
- How beautiful!
- Too!

3
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,700
Linda!

4
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,800
... and little tighter.
Very, very good.

5
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,200
Congratulations.

6
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
- Your shoes are beautiful.
- Thanks.

7
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
- Thank you.
- The pleasure is mine.

8
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,500
I... leaving out, Dad.

9
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,600
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Is George?

10
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,100
Always is.

11
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,500
My love! How are you?
It would be nice to see you!

12
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,900
- Are you happy with your mom?
- Of course I am!

13
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,800
- She is incredible.
- I know.

14
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,900
- Thanks for coming.
- I imagined.

15
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,900
Tell George that I regret
that has not come.

16
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,700
I will tell you.

17
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,800
How are you?

18
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,500
How was it?

19
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,100
The shoes were beautiful,
of course.

20
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,700
The paper appeared dressed.
The models were like sticks.

21
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,700
Is it not tempting, no?

22
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
Come on.

23
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,100
Should give you a shelter of those.

24
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,800
Not what you want.
You 're going to adore him!

25
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,700
- Not going to retire.
- 24 hours per day...

26
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,800
Hi, Vera.

27
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,200
Hello.

28
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,100
Eleanor, how are you?

29
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,600
- Do you know Ralph?
- Yes, I know Ralph.

30
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,400
- Lisa, a picture can get you out...
- I'm going to get a table.

31
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,200
- Finally!
- Hello.

32
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,100
I'm hungry.

33
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,200
- Was it good, no?
- It was great!

34
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,100
Be honest!

35
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,100
Okay, so I will be.

36
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,500
- Abigail went flying by.
- Honestly...

37
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,500
-... You two...
- What?

38
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,400
I have a daughter who "goes flying '
a husband who mocked...

39
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
Lisa, come on.

40
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,400
I jest. I like your shoes.
Those who can not stand the fit.

41
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,800
Well... fish fritters.
You will not find this in Milan.

42
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,100
- Is Milan, no?
- Gianni, Gianni.

43
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,600
Which of them still live with your mother?

44
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,100
Gianni, of course.

45
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,800
Indeed, both live.

46
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,700
A lady in black
protecting farming.

47
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,400
They make great shoes.

48
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,300
You make wonderful shoes.

49
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,700
Do you think two people can
live together throughout their lives?

50
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,800
We accomplish this by more
one half of ours.

51
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,500
- Do we have problems?
- Of course we have no problems.

52
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,100
Is that wrong?

53
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,000
Why that question?

54
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,200
I'm thinking.

55
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,700
Abigail... George...

56
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,600
- Is it going to marry?
- Abigail...

57
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,200
What?

58
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,900
Well, you know.

59
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,600
- Are you jealous?
- What George?

60
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,100
- I think I like George.
- You have a strange taste in men.

61
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,400
- Not yet chosen.
- Come back later.

62
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,000
Ever wanted to have the opportunity
sleeping with a person?

63
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,400
Lisa, will you tell me?

64
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,700
I am asking.

65
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
So?

66
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,000
- Peter?
- No!

67
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,200
I mean, no!
I do not want to sleep with another.

68
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,600
Maybe not yet found
the right person.

69
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,600
- No, never. I swear.
- It is a choice. Not an oath.

70
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Meet someone, fall in love,
have the opportunity...

71
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,900
... and you make a choice.

72
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,400
I'll choose you.

73
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,800
I love you, you know?

74
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Know that, right?

75
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,600
If you do not love, I would go.

76
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,800
- You would go?
- Yes, I would go. Not to take anything.

77
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,700
Sola. To restart.

78
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,300
Be good, then.

79
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,800
I need to tell you something.

80
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Do not move.

81
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,800
Do not move.

82
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,700
I do not want to worry about.

83
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,700
And why would they?

84
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,500
What happens, Lees?

85
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,300
Nothing.

86
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,800
- None. I'm fine.
- You sure?

87
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,100
Sure. I'm fine.

88
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,300
- Milan?
- The Gianni, I told you.

89
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,900
Seriously, you call.

90
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,400
- Dad?
- I'm up.

91
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,900
Stay with it.

92
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
- Why?
- Do not want to.

93
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,800
- I do not want things from her.
- I do not want this here. Stay with it.

94
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I know that we are of the same size y...

95
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,800
Is... would be strange.

96
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,000
Whatever.

97
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,300
I feel happy
taking their things.

98
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,600
The cells of your mother.

99
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,900
- Is not it Mom?
- How funny.

100
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,400
You were always so.
Like when I was little.

101
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,300
I remember a story I wrote
for you. It was about a bear.

102
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,000
I surrender, catch y...

103
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,000
... and you first turn to
what we were doing.

104
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I am speaking, and even finger
you're not listening...

105
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,200
... and I'm just talking to
not having to listen to your silence...

106
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,100
... and not because they think you care
what I'm saying.

107
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,500
Mom asked me to leave this
for you.

108
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,900
What is it?

109
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,900

Dad?

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,900
Was that why she went?
zEntered into orbit?

113
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,200
Has a new message.

114
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,800
I just wanted to hear your voice.
Just that. He spent so much time.

115
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,400
I know I should not
call, but...

116
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,800
... I wanted to hear your voice.

117
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:08,000
I just wanted to hear your voice.
Just that. He spent so much time.

118
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,100
I know I should not
call, but...

119
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,400

Hello, Mr. Ryman.

136
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,900
Peter!
How are you, darling?

137
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,500
- You know Eleanor.
- Hello, Peter.

138
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,000
- Did you know?
- What?

139
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,700
- Did you know about them?
- Peter?

140
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,800
Ralph, yes.

141
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,900
- How long have happened?
- Peter, are you okay?

142
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,800
What I should put your computer
shit in your fucking head!

143
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,800
- What are you talking about?
- Lisa.

144
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,800
- Whenever you liked?
- Of course!

145
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,100
- And she like it?
- I think so.

146
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,100
But not like that.

147
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,600
You can not believe we had
an adventure! Peter!

148
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,100
That's absurd!

149
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,200
And if she...

150
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,500
- I do not blame.
- Ralph!

151
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,900
Honestly, I never understood
what he saw in you.

152
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,200
I do not see why I should be insulted.
I do not see why.

153
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,900
Peter...

154
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,300
... there is one person...

155
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,800
... she really had a friend.

156
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,900
- We know nothing more. Really, Peter.
- Who is he?

157
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,500
Why should it be
else?

158
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,900
Why do people love?

159
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,400
- Abi...
- No!

160
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,700
You should be ashamed to ask
these things about Mom.

161
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,300
¡Ashamed!

162
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,000
Is everything okay?

163
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,300
See you in a minute.

164
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,700
Agreed.

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,100
We were just two of us
in Italy, Dad.

166
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,300
And we went to Lake Como
We went to Venice.

167
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,200
Here.

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,200
After I wash the face,
You can use the bathroom.

169
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,500
6:30 because we agreed to leave George
his early work, and I too.

170
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
- See you for breakfast.
- Abi...

171
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,600
Good night.

172
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,300
Dad?

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,600
"Your message came."

174
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,800
"But not for women
who wrote. "

175
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,900

Lisa loved that the "...

00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,400
Peter.

181
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,400
Peter?

182
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,900
Ralph...

183
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,800
I'm Guy.

184
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Ralph...

185
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,500
Me?

186
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,700
No, I was thinking
you, Guy.

187
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,800
Good to see you back.

188
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,400
I need not hide
or anything like that.

189
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,400
Who said that?

190
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,700
If you'd rather stay home, Peter...

191
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,400
... you're the boss.
We drive.

192
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,100
Having problems with pests
in the garden, Guy?

193
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,500
Not stand it.
Kill the unfortunate.

194
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,300
Can you call Joy, please?

195
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,000
We have two Joy.
The Security and Systems.

196
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,900
- Security.
- Peter...

197
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,100
I do not want to be rude, Guy, but...

198
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,500
- If you need me...
- Thanks.

199
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,700
Sit down, Joy.

200
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,100
Sorry for the contract of LD.

201
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,500
I was excited about the fact
that I have offered...

202
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,200
I got an e-mail
and I want an identity.

203
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,300
- Pardon?
- I know who he is, where you live...

204
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
That is not legal, Peter.

205
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,600
So do not do it.

206
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,500
I will not.

207
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,000
I've never done this.

208
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,400
No, but...
know what they do.

209
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,900
Trying to intercept an e-mail,
get the number of LP...

210
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,200
... try to get the SMTP
server...

211
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,500
... and ask to receive e-mails
in that direction...

212
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,700
... using the EXPN and VRFY options.

213
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,200
Could work.

214
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,200
Depends if the server is
misconfigured, but it is not always so.

215
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,500
What do we know?

216
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
He says that is called 'Ralph'.

217
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,700
Yes

218
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,300
I know.

219
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,000
I want to kill him.

220
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,200
- Who pays for the software?
- I, not the company.

221
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,200
That's good.

222
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,900
No need to know
you're behind him.

223
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,500
I want it to be a big surprise.

224
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,200
"What nonsense is this...
which ended on our love? "

225
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,800
"It's easy to say,
but do not "...

226
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,200
... "because the past still
is very much alive for us. "

227
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,200
"Your message"...

228
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,000
... "I was very happy."

229
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,800
Ralph.

230
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,800
It's easy to say,
but do not...

231
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,400
... because the past still
is very much alive for us.

232
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,300
Your message left me
very happy. Ralph.

233
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,400
It's easy to say,
but do not...

234
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,800
... very much alive...

235
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,900
-... Your message...
- You okay, Peter?

236
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,900
Fuiste police, Eric.
Where do I get a gun?

237
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,400
- A gun?
- Yes

238
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,600
You will not.
You should not think about that.

239
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,400
Want to get a gun.

240
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,800
Do not be silly, Eric.

241
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,000
LAKE COMO

242
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,600
Milan Restaurant

243
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,100
Wonderful

244
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,000
Old shoes

245
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,900
Spring Lake Como

246
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,200
The address you want is

248
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,000
¡Gail!

249
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,900
Would you book a flight
for tonight at Milan?

250
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,300
Lisa will go to hotel.
I do not remember the name.

251
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,700
Peter...

252
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,400
- Eric said...
- Reservalo.

253
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,700
Please, Gail.

254
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,200
Good evening, sir.

255
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,000
- Mom!
- Come on, sweetie.

256
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,600

257
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
... please, talk later
of the signal.

258
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,400
Dad...

259
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,300
... Are you there?

260
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,800
Dad?

261
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,300
Call me.

262
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,600
I do not know what you're doing.

263
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,300
- Is it good?
- Yes, it's good.

264
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,100

I know.

267
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,500
- Champion of the world, huh?
- You will see!

268
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,000
- Okay, okay.
- Thanks.

269
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,700
- Excuse me, sir.
- Sorry.

270
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,000
Thank you.

271
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,000
I could never leave.

272
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,200
Why let me?

273
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,900
- Good morning, sir.
- How are you?

274
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
Does this table is yours?

275
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,100
zEnglish?

276
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,500
No, no, please.

277
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,400
Sorry.

278
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,200
That India is the defense of the Queen
Right?

279
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,500
Yes it is.

280
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,600
I love it.

281
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,800
Blacks have
sacrificing to the Queen.

282
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,700
But, what happens if you use
India to defend the Queen.

283
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,700
There he goes.

284
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,900
Peter.

285
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,800
- Rafe.
- Rafe?

286
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,100
Another fan of chess.

287
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,300
- Will the game?
- Please.

288
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,300
Well. Thank you.

289
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,500
Okay.

290
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,100
Here we go.

291
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:21,800
zRafe?
Is R-A-L-P-H, right?

292
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,400
Of course, sir.

293
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,300
Spanish father, mother English.

294
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,100
So I was not Rafe,
but Ralph.

295
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,200
Is spelled A-L-R-P-H,
of course.

296
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,600
She likes things
thoroughly correct.

297
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,800
My mother.

298
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,400
She had qualities
and defects.

299
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,200
Especially...

300
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,800
... defects.

301
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,900
Why did you choose Milan?

302
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,800
I am a cosmopolitan.

303
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,700
I am not staying in the same place,
doing the same thing, day after day.

304
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:08,800
- Who is it? Do you?
- No...

305
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,000
... no.

306
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,800
I travel occasionally.

307
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,100
I like London...

308
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,200
... New York...

309
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,300
- "Please, Daddy, tell me where YOU"
- I never had much time...

310
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,900
Australia...... to know

311
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,900
... but it circulates through all
civilized places.

312
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,800
England z?

313
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,400
Oxford?
zCambridge, perhaps?

314
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,500
Cambridge.

315
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,700
I had a lover here
She lived in Cambridge.

316
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,600
When I was in the business
of fashion.

317
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,900
She made shoes.

318
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,100
Shoes.

319
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,500
When I say 'shoes' that I seem
saying that Baryshnikov is a dancer.

320
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,800
Yes..

321
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,700
... was here.

322
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,500
In Milan.

323
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,500
I saw those...

324
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,300
high red shoes... vermell.

325
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,900
And I saw that...

326
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,800
... women.

327
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,500
She was walking
in my direction...

328
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,700
... and, for a moment,
seems incredible, but...

329
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:32,900
... all I saw...
were his shoes.

330
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,100
I make shoes.

331
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,100
And you?

332
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,200
I am interested in poetry...

333
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,200
... and thus the feet.

334
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,200
- Was it long ago?
- Yes

335
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,800
Ten... no, 12... 12 years.

336
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,200
Y...

337
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,800
... When was the last time
you seen that?

338
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,500
Actually...

339
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,300
... 9 months ago.

340
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:21,400
But I have good reason to believe
that will see you again soon.

341
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,900
Check.

342
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,400
Dad?

343
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,400
Peter?

344
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,900
Peter?

345
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,700
Hello?

346
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,400
Has a new message.

347
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,600
Lisa...

348
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,500
... please let me hear
your voice again.

349
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,600
I know you swore to not call, but...

350
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,100
... your e-mails let me desperate
to hear your voice.

351
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,200
Call me. Please.
Bye.

352
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,900
What do you do in Milan
Giannis these?

353
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,000
You scared me.

354
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Fair.
One hell!

355
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,900
Expecting to feel sorry for you?

356
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:13,700
Are you desperate to do that?

357
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,100
- Your friend always come to Milan?
- Yes

358
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,800
You'll readily provide things
but no doubt my love!

359
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,300
She was trying to avoid.

360
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,500
- I would like everything was different.
- I know.

361
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,400
I was very persistent.

362
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,600
You know.
If we could be together...

363
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,900
... live to each other,
without knocking anyone else, but...

364
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,700
-... Our world is not so.
- No, I know.

365
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,000
- Do not keep saying 'I know'.
- I know.

366
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,900
- I know, I know...
- I know.

367
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,300
I know, I know, I know...

368
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,300
- I know.
- I know, I know, I know...

369
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,300
Thanks!

370
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,400
- You scared me.
- I heard you had arrived.

371
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,800
- How was Milan?
- Funny. Well.

372
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,800
- Is everything okay?
- Of course.

373
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,700
I am so happy to see you.

374
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,900
Meet someone, fall in love,
have the opportunity...

375
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,200
... and you make a choice.

376
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,900
¡Lisa!

377
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:29,200
Have you met any women
you want to live?

378
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,500
Several desperate to live with me,
but do not live with any.

379
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,000
I go with them, yes. Often
for a long time, but do not live with them.

380
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,900
- Are you married?
- We have a daughter.

381
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,600
I have a son.

382
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,000
- Are you married long?
- Almost 25 years.

383
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,700
We had separate careers,
with everything that means.

384
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,500
We had a good marriage. Always
trust each other, never doubt.

385
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,300
That's good, very good.

386
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,800
Excellent, but not for me.
No.

387
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,300
There is always doubt, my friend.

388
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,300
Marriage is a hell,
I'm sure you discovered it.

389
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,000
Prefer hotels and paradise.

390
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,100
Come and see.

391
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,800
We booked for you.

392
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,800
Your bishop is wrong.

393
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,700
And mine is fine.

394
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,800
You are a scoundrel, Rafe!

395
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,200
Sorry. Forgive me.

396
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,800
We, the Spaniards,
We are passionate people..

397
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,900
Your bishop is fine, but...

398
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,900
... Check!

399
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,600
Unless they get stolen.

400
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,600
- Cheating.
- It is not my game.

401
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,400
I am not a person cheats.

402
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,100
Excuse me.

403
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:42,200
zLisa?

404
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,400
zLisa?

405
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,200
I know that you...

406
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,600
I know you're there, Lisa.

00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,100

Answer.
I know you're there, Lisa!

410
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,500
Talk to me.
Let me hear your voice.

411
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,900
Honey, please, talk to me.

412
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,000

413
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,500

I know you're there!

415
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,800
zLisa?

416
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,100
Honey, talk to me!

417
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,800
¡Lisa!

418
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,900
My love...

419
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,100
... the passion that I feel...

420
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:46,100
I can not be without you,
like you can not be without me.

421
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,700
If I leave,
I will be devastated.

422
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,800
I am scared.

423
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,800
Well.

424
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,700
Do not let me get to that.

425
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,500
What else can I do?

426
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,600
Who are you happiest?

427
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,600
- Now?
- In this moment.

428
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:15,900
Contigo.

429
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,800
Then I will be happy with another.

430
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,500
- With him?
- Of course, with him.

431
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:45,200
Excuse me.
Where do you think they are?

432
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,100
I got a call yesterday.

433
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,100
A call by designer
of shoes.

434
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,300
I can only describe as a woman
more beautiful world.

435
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,300
Now I know...

436
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,900
... she is the only woman
who could love.

437
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,000
Check.

438
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,200
So she called you?

439
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,500
Called.

440
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,500
Did you talk to her?

441
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,100
She received my call.

442
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,100
Can you ride?

443
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:50,200
You know, the horses...
and women...

444
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,100
... of course, you know that...

445
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,400
... good hands...

446
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,800
... is crucial.

447
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,500
... Checkmate! mate!

448
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,800
Bastard!
How dare you?

449
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,900
Just a shit game
chess, man!

450
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,400
Oh, the 15hs!
Gotta go.

451
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,400
Is not gonna pay?

452
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,000
If I talk to her,
what did she say?

453
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,600
- Do you pay?
- Here it is.

454
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,300
What did she?

455
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,400
- Dad!
- Oh, Abigail!

456
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,900
- I knew where I was.
- George wine?

457
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,300
- No.
- Come on.

458
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,000
- Where are we going?
- How can I tell?

459
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,500
- Talk to him.
- What?

460
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,300
- With her lover.
- What?

461
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,100
Not told the truth.
Not told anything.

462
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,900
- The mother cell. Called back.
- He?

463
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,600
Of course he did!

464
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,000
Talk to him every day.
We played chess together.

465
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,700
- What?
- He does not know who I am.

466
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,100
It's monstrous! Your hands
particularly disgust me!

467
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,700
- Hands roses!
- I want to know.

468
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,900
It is not the same for you!

469
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,500
He has no hands horrible.

470
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,700
Read e-mails from him.

471
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,000
- Dad...
- Listen!

472
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,800
Do not touch...

473
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,100
... until you put your hands around
my neck the first night.

474
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,800
Do not you remember?

475
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,300
We never pass
days and nights together in bed!

476
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,400
It was cold. So cold
you do not want to leave.

477
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,200
So I sat,
I passed up yours...

478
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,600
... and turned on the light in your hand.

479
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,500
And then finally get
arms under the covers...

480
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,000
... and I was thrust on you.

481
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,300
I dare not ask
see you again...

482
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,100
... but you should know that I would
that very much. Rafe.

483
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,400
Calls' Rafe '.

484
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,600
He says things like... 'the most beautiful woman
the world ', with their jeans out of fashion...

485
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,600
... yellow middle, Gucci moccasins...
Fucking crazy!

486
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,800
¡Gucci moccasins!

487
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,200
- Do you answer it?
- Cree who she is.

488
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,900
No!

489
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,100
Dad, please, forget this.

490
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,700
He says things like,
'I pushed you'.

491
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,900
What about her? What kind of woman
cree in that nonsense?

492
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,800
How can she?
Do not cry.

493
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,800
- I'm not crying!
- I was not enough for her.

494
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,900
I'm so angry
that could kill him!

495
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,300
I was always faithful.

496
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,500
I thought we were friends,
contábamos us all.

497
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:10,800
But it was a different person.
Should have been.

498
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,600
And what is worse? That the person
you love, be it another person...

499
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,000
- With another man, or they are equal?
- Dad, please. Please for.

500
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,300
- It's so offensive!
- Do not stand more!

501
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,500
¡Forget this!

502
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,300
So I sat,
I passed up yours...

503
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,700
... and turned on the light in your hand.

504
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:36,900
And then finally get
arms under the covers...

505
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,900
... and I pushed you.

506
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,500
My God, you scared me!

507
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,300
I guess.

508
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:42,300
I was...
you'll love...

509
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,000
... this is...

510
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,000
... I'm just here...

511
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,400
... to take care of the 'turtle'...

512
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,500
How do you say in English?
Tartaruga...

513
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,600
- Turtle?
- Turtle! Do you like turtles?

514
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,800
Do not touch me, please.

515
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,500
Do not blame them.
It is not the clothing business!

516
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,600
Come here.

517
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,100
Enter.

518
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:12,200
When my mother began to dig
land near the bushes...

519
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,100
... imagine anything less...

520
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,400
... that was burying eggs.

521
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,000
But it was that.
Three eggs!

522
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,500
Then I put it here...

523
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,400
... and 2 of them
born turtles.

524
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,900
You okay?

525
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,200
"Tartaruga"
as called in Italy.

526
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,700
Two were born, but I lost one.

527
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:13,000
And I regret to say,
It was with downloading the bathroom.

528
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,200
Sentimental You bastard!

529
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Bastard!

530
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,800
- It's nothing.
- How dare you?

531
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,900
Okay, I pay.

532
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,900
- I pay! I will pay!
- What are you doing?

533
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,500
I only have little time to take my flight.
Nothing they're doing okay, Dad.

534
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,900
You are enfermandote
and in conviertiéndote hateful.

535
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,300
Still not good.
It's over!

536
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:52,300
- Forget. Sigue adelante. She left.
- No, Abi. Sorry.

537
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,400
Walk, walk.
Airport.

538
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,500
"We're going to find us
this weekend. "

539
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:44,700
Our Lake Como Hotel.
Dinner at 20 pm on Friday. Lisa.

540
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,900
Hello?

541
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,900
Peter, I have a small problem...

542
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,300
Let me pay for lunch tomorrow.

543
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:13,500
Are we
in my apartment?

544
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:27,800
Good evening.

545
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:38,500
Peter!
Upload.

546
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,100
In my apartment.

547
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,900
- Is your apartment?
- Get.

548
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,600
- This is...
- When I'm in town, yes.

549
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,200
I have great news.

550
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:01,100
Although it is a secret
to avoid publicity.

551
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:06,600
Want to be passing
the weekend with her.

552
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,600
In Lake Como
Always in our hotel.

553
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,900
My friend...

554
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,900
... the famous,
designer shoes.

555
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,300
- Good.
- You know...

556
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,900
... I was thinking...
You know me...

557
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,900
... on a second honeymoon
in Lake Como

558
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,400
Something.

559
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,500
Then going to London.

560
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:34,800
To be honest, things are
be somewhat difficult for me here.

561
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,200
Temporary problems
Cash Flow...

562
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:43,000
I was thinking about giving
a surprise party for her.

563
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,400
To 'join rags' and mark
the beginning of our life together.

564
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,700
London z?

565
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:51,000
- A party, but...
- No 'buts'. Not economic.

566
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,800
- 'Separate rags. With style.
- It is' uniting '.

567
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,700
Do you think that?

568
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,700
I pay the bill.
No, no...

569
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,600
Is the bare minimum to help a friend
that is temporarily below.

570
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,500
'Below'...

571
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,400
How much?

572
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,100
Cash, of course.

573
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:14,200
I hope to be invited to this event
in London.

574
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,100
- Yes
- What do you have in mind?

575
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,900
Friends of her cosmopolitan as I...

576
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,500
More?

577
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,600
- People of the world of fashion...
- More?

578
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:25,500
Why not?

579
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,300
Good night.

580
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,900
Booking name
of 'Carentis.

581
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,000
The person is here, sir.

582
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,700
I regret disappointing.

583
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,700
She did not come.

584
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,200
Lisa.

585
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,000
zLisa?

586
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,200
She died.

587
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,500
Lisa.

588
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:43,200
My wife. Died.

589
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,500
I...

590
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,900
I did, okay?

591
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,400
zAppetizers, gentlemen?

592
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,000
- How did she die?
- Cancer.

593
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,300
Did you suffer?

594
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,100
Suffer?

595
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:30,300
I was so thin that it could
load with only one arm.

596
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,600
They say they can cope
pain today.

597
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,700
True, they know.

598
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,700
Peter?

599
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,600
Want to join?

600
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,000
Wished that she had yelled,
sometimes.

601
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,900
Be fine.

602
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:01,900
She told me he was sick
when it was too late.

603
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,900
Because they did not know that.
It was so... stupid!

604
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,800
- It was suggested that Dr...
- By vanity.

605
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,400
Shut up.

606
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,800
Of course it was not for vanity. She knew
I do not mind their appearance.

607
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,100
I knew that she refused
to surgery.

608
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,900
I know now.

609
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,600
zLisa was proud of his appearance?

610
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,800
Not talking about it.

611
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,500
I think she...

612
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,900
... she did not want...

613
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,000
She never complained!

614
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,200
She...

615
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,000
... you want to be beautiful.

616
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:27,000
It is not a crime.

617
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,600
- What is it not?
- The look that matters.

618
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,800
- It was not vanity.
- How dare you?

619
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,800
She was merely waiting
that everything will happen.

620
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,900
- Pasara?
- Yeah, pass.

621
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:39,900
She was perfect.

622
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:45,600
- Everything you did was perfect.
- Do not be silly. It was exactly the opposite.

623
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,700
- She lived in the perfection of the moment.
- It was not perfect. He was blind!

624
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,500
And the future?
Does not matter?

625
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:02,900
You know...

626
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,800
... I was very happy with you.

627
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,100
Where?

628
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,800
Where were you happiest?

629
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,800
- Peter, I...
- Write.

630
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,000
Here.

631
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,900
Come on. Take the pen.

632
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,300
Come on.

633
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,200
Writes.

634
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,500
zI bet that will equal, right?

635
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,100
Cursed believed.

636
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:59,300
I have a better idea.
Enter the place where we were never.

637
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:02,100
Where you can take.

638
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,800
You can take me anywhere.

639
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,600
How did you hear about me?

640
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:23,400
You were in a folder
called 'Love'.

641
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,600
In my wife's computer.

642
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,700
Did you read my e-mails?

643
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,900
All of them.

644
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:41,500
I pretend that everything is better
what it is.

645
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,700
What's money where it is not.

646
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,400
Makes things
more beautiful than they are.

647
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,900
I can do that, I'm good at that.

648
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:57,700
The losers are bright for
make things more beautiful.

649
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,200
And I have to convert the world
more beautiful when I can...

650
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:07,200
... leave the center,
heart of things...

651
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,300
... those things, and your...

652
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,500
... you only see the surface.

653
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,900
George is not the man
appropriate for him.

654
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:19,400
But it is for me.

655
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,800
I know.

656
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,200
Do not have to be either, right?

657
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:30,100
We can love two people
at the same time. I think so.

658
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:32,200
It's true.

659
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,300
Honey, you know you always
I loved your father.

660
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,700
Mom...

661
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,800
... I know.

662
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:42,100
It is a simple reality.

663
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:47,000
I am only just.
We are George and me.

664
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,500
Dad finds this confusing y...

665
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,000
... he likes everything in its place...

666
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:55,000
... and probably would change all this,
but you can not change.

667
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:59,100
Sometimes I want to say
to fall into reality.

668
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,200
No.

669
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,100
- Call your father.
- No, Mom, I'll do that.

670
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,300
Call your father.

671
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,300
So... it is.
Completed.

672
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,200
You can still give the party for her.
I will not be there, of course.

673
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,800
Of course.

674
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,600
You revenge, right?

675
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,900
I am a phony...

676
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:34,900
... it's doorman, and would accept
any job, whatever.

677
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,000
Which boasts of the past
like a catalog of triumphs...

678
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:42,600
... and do not take no pay,
bankruptcy and imprisonment.

679
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,300
I am sure of that.

680
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,700
I should have noticed.

681
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:51,700
¡Those e-mails were so...
bastards like you!

682
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,300
I felt pretty, of course.

683
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,300
LAKE

684
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,400
Can you do something for me?

685
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,600
Put it in the red shoes
in my room.

686
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,600
This is for dad.

687
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,700
How will he find?

688
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,200
You will find it.

689
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,500
But do you know?

690
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:10,200
She knew everything about me
and paid my debts.

691
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,800
And she loved me...

692
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,700
... despite that.

693
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,200
Thanks for the suit.

694
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,500
And in the room.

695
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,500
I can not offer to pay,
but how I would do it.

696
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,100
You can feel free
to enjoy dinner.

697
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,800
Okay.
Okay.

698
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,900
Let me go, Peter.

699
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:09,700
I can not.

700
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,900
Necessary.

701
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,600
Where is dinner?

702
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:34,700
It's mine.

703
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:40,100
Excuse me.

704
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,400
MOM

705
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,700
- Hello?
- Abi? Are you at work?

706
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,700
Dad?

707
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,500
- Okay.
- Can I talk to?

708
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:05,300
Yes, talk, Dad. Is what
people do on the phone.

709
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,400
Abi, you can go to London?

710
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,600
I know it's about time
but if George can take a few days...

711
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,300
Where?

712
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,300
Then I told Berlusconi,
'Silvio...

713
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,900
you can manage... more
that a football team.

714
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,700
'You can manage the country. "
And he followed my advice.

715
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:27,300
Then he said,
'Want to be my assistant particular? "

716
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:31,900
I said, 'I have several commitments
I do not know if I will have time '.

717
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,900
¡Rafe! You look great.

718
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:38,300
Good. It's wonderful
you've come.

719
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:43,800
Do you know Peter Ryman?
Systems engineer...

720
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,200
... and a friend of Bill Gates.

721
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,500
Reverend Tim Brookes.

722
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:54,500
- We met the other day in the hospital.
- Yes, now I work there.

723
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,100
Lisa was...

724
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,800
... a woman happy...

725
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,100
... besides being a great
designer shoes...

726
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,400
... and a great artist.

727
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,000
I can still see it...

728
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,300
... taking the pencil...

729
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,100
... I never left the paper.

730
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,100
Lines up underneath
to the top...

731
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,600
... along the line above...

732
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,900
... through the front,
draw the line...

733
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,000
... plunge into direction
of the fingers...

734
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,900
petted for top......

735
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,200
... as a caress in address
top-down...

736
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:48,000
-... To the top.
- That sort of thing.

737
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,200
By Lisa.

738
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,500
By Lisa!

739
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,500
Well, Rafe.

740
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,700
Look at him.

741
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,400
There he is.

742
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,600
Rafe.

743
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,800
Here is Rafe.

744
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,100
Dad...

745
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,100
Our host.

746
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:24,600
God bless you.

747
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:32,500
And now, my toast.
For Lisa, my wife...

748
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:36,700
... your friend...

749
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,600
... my...

750
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:48,600
love.

751
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,800
By Lisa.

752
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,600
And our daughter, Abigail.

753
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,500
By Abigail!

754
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,800
All this talk about shoes.

755
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,200
Rafe.

756
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,100
¡Rafe!

757
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,600
How disgusting and horrible man!

758
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:38,500
But...

759
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,500
What?

760
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,500
He was also wonderful.

761
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,400
And she too.

762
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,000
She really knew me, no?

763
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:09,200
A us.

764
01:22:12,700 --> 01:22:13,900
To him.

765
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,300
The train is
on the platform 7...

766
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:06,700
... 1226 will be making connections
between London and Cambridge.

767
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:12,300
For in Letchworth Garden City,
Royston and Cambridge.

768
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,400
Platform 7 at 12.26...

769
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:19,400
... that makes connections between
London and Cambridge.

770
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,900
For security reasons,
do not leave your luggage...

771
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:49,700
... and other elements in any
part of the terminal.

772
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:54,300
Any items left
shall be withdrawn by the police.
