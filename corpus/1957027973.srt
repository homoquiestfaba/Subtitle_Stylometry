is... is a marvelous example.

255
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:25,813
That is, we allow the spirits

to take kind of a temporary
control of our body,

how can one open
an interdimensional portal?

00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,934
In theory,

261
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:51,238
any reflective surface

262
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,942
can be a door to another dimension.

00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,044
In theory.

264
00:12:57,077 --> 00:13:00,780

265
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,249
Correct.

266
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:06,786
If you place two mirrors face to face

267

so that there is the endless tunnel,

268
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:17,330
it is said that it is a way
for some things to come through.

What sorts of things?

270
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,068
Well, once a, uh...

271

Once a portal to another
dimension is opened up,

272
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:27,740

to escape the afterlife, demons.

00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,878
Most people like to use
what's called an emf to detect

703
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:15,914
electromagnetic phenomena or anomalies.

704
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,584
This little guy...
A hell of a lot cheaper,

705
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,019

706
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,721
But why a compass?

707
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,156
I mean, there's the obvious.

708
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,492
You get lost,
it helps you find your way out.

709
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:30,296
But when you're around an anomaly,

710
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:31,797
the electromagnetism in it

711
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,000
causes the needle
to start spinning like a top.

712
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:38,437
So, no anomalies in this room?

713
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,838
No.

As of right now, there are not,

715
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:45,411
but would you mind if we
did a full sweep at this point?

716

-The compass isn't moving.
There's nothing down here yet.

726

Um... it's 15 past midnight.

730
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:39,030
on the possible apparitions?

731

I can, yeah.

732
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:47,639
Isn't midnight supposed to be
the hour of ghosts and ghouls?

733
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,908
Spirits of the dead were once human,

734
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:53,312
and sometimes after they pass,

735
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:56,081
the spirits can stay attached
to certain times

736
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:59,184
that meant something to them
when they were alive.

of... another exit.

But it's probably closed.

746
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:24,576
It's just probably bad wiring.

to run experiments

But why not?

767

Well, I mean, there's inherited
risk involved, obviously,

a portal is even possible.
