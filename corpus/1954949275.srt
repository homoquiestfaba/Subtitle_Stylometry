And how'd you get here?

212
00:17:06,457 --> 00:17:08,423
I went to San José,

for my wisdom tooth
to be removed.

214
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:13,445
I was visiting

and they didn't want
to go out one night,

216

where you were before?

Yeah, I was,
was in a Mexican prison.

220
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:30,345
It was just an ounce.

They, uh,
searched my car.

It wasn't hidden very well,

224

225
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:40,956
Somebody must have slipped
something in my drink,

seeing spots.

Berto was in Mexico.

You'll get tossed about.

The raft'll get broken apart to
a million different pieces.

00:38:29,071 --> 00:38:30,355
I got you.

You're okay.

You were choking me.

555
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:41,683
Yes, but I need you
not to be afraid of it.

How does your mom
feel about all that?

557

She didn't feel anything.

558

She was already dead.

I'm sorry.

What happened to her?

00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:58,983
It was a robbery.

00:38:59,051 --> 00:39:00,718
It went bad.

563
00:39:02,738 --> 00:39:05,372
That's why it was
so important for our father

564
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,408
that his daughters learn
how to fight.

565

Well, Rina rebelled
after our mother was killed.

609
00:40:27,673 --> 00:40:30,174
She moved to New York

610
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:32,577
and got deep into heroin.

611
00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:35,496
Dad cut her off,
but she just blamed him

612
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:37,732
for not being there for our mother.

613
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:40,051
I got so angry with her.

614
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:43,988
I told her I wished
she would just disappear,

615
00:40:44,056 --> 00:40:46,057
and she did.

616
00:40:46,158 --> 00:40:48,709
She was arrested in Juarez
six years ago

617
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:51,095
for possession
of heroin and cocaine.

618
00:40:51,163 --> 00:40:55,116
I guess you could say
she has a bit of a problem.

619
00:40:56,718 --> 00:40:59,020
She has a good heart, though.

is not connected, then I've got

of this call?

Is it an emergency?
You tell me.

somebody else in, right?

It was supposed to last a month,

not a permanent thing!

Are you crazy?

No, I want off the island.

It's as simple as that.

And you'll get off
the island as promised,

661
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:35,416
and you'll be rich
as promised, all right?

662
00:42:35,484 --> 00:42:37,935
Just give me
a little bit more time.

with Mao

my way,

They don't know about
this place.

It's got
fresh running water.

As long as you don't mind
the bats, it's all good.
