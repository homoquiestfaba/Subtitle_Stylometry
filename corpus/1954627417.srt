1
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,600
"She had an incredibly beautiful
doll as a gift."

2
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,480
"Oh, what a fantastic doll.
So beautiful and nice."

3
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,520
"She seemed not created
for this world's sorrows."

4
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
Mom.

5
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,280
Mom.

6
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,640
IRELAND 1890
MIDSUMMER NIGHT

7
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,920
Diana!

8
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,520
I followed the baron to the train.
Strange that Miss Julie is not traveling.

9
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,800
All friends celebrate midsummer
together. Big event.

10
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,160
He gave me the boots to polish
and switched to something grander.

11
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,720
His SUPERCILIOUSNESS.
His most divine gentility.

12
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,760
His vanity, most stylish supremacy.
Sir Boots, I think.

13
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,200
Baron went into the station
and asked me to wait.

14
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,360
When he came out
la have something in a folder.

15
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,720
Guess what was in the folder.
A stack of travel brochures.

16
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,480
As if people like me traveled so.

17
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,440
But no money.
They do not think so, the people.

18
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,280
No, they do not think so.

19
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,200
At the barn, I asked the stableboy
bring home the horses and I went Check

20
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,440
and saw Miss Julie cite dance
with the gamekeeper. Skogkvaktaren!

21
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,040
When she sees me she comes rushing
and command me to dance with her.

22
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,280
She thinks he can control all.

23
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,120
Who am I?
I can not control anything.

24
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Oh, Kathleen, come and see the pictures.

25
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,640
Paris. Rome.

26
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,360
This is Lake Como.
I know that area.

27
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,400
Jeez, what beautiful it is.

28
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,840
I'm hungry!

29
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,840
- It's kidney, your favorite foods.
- Lovely.

30
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,680
<i>Yes, this is my big délice.
You would have warmed my plate.</i>

31
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,600
You are harder to please than the Baron.

32
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,640
Give me a glass.

33
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,960
<i>A real glass. A nicely.
When you drink wine nests.</i>

34
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,560
That's right.
It's a bit too cold.

35
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,480
- What are you cooking like stink so?
- Something bastard nity to the lady's dog.

36
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,120
Miss Julie
believe that it is pregnant again.

37
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,320
Because she has been closely
Forester's dog.

38
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,760
Miss Julie said she saw them
and it made her nauseous.

39
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:16,240
She'd rather risk that the dog dies
than get a mixed breed. God help her.

40
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,440
You should have seen her
come to the dance.

41
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,640
She looked as if had been
on the ground and took a nap.

42
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,200
We had not behaved so.

43
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,600
But still - she is elegant,
Miss Julie.

44
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,760
Magnificent.

45
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,480
- Oh, her waist. Her neck.
- Stop.

46
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,600
I have heard Clara talk.

47
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,800
She has seen her naked
often as she bathes her.

48
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,280
Clara for squint
to see something right.

49
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,080
You women always envied each other.

50
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,240
I've ridden with her
and know her.

51
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,960
How she sits on the horse.
Her legs.

52
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,720
And how she dances.

53
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
Well?

54
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,400
Is that clear?
My fetuses driving married?

55
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,280
Is it a WITCH BROTH the ladies
concocts on Midsummer Eve?

56
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,680
Listen.

57
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,560
Come on, dance with me again.

58
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,120
No offense, but I have promised
to dance with Kathleen.

59
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,200
Let me borrow him, Kathleen.
You can go and rest.

60
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,520
If Miss Julie is so friendly
he can not say no.

61
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,200
Go you, John.
Be grateful for the honor.

62
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,800
Frankly, without
wanting to offend somehow...

63
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,240
Miss Julie should perhaps not dance
twice with the same partner.

64
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,720
What are you talking about?
I, house härskarinna-

65
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,520
- honors the people dancing in the barn
with my presence.

66
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,240
But I have to dance with the one that
, the steps so I do not look ridiculous.

67
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
As you command, Miss Julie.

68
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,600
I am at your service.

69
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,040
I have chosen to put away all rank
and it must also do.

70
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,320
Come on, give me your arm.

71
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,000
Thank you, John. I do not want
treat you like a child.

72
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,640
We walk through the entrance hall.
It had you thought about, right?

73
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,560
Do not be afraid, Kathleen.
I do not hold with your fiance.

74
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,960
That's what he is?

75
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,480
You are a man of the future, is not it?

76
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,840
Diana, come here.

77
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,280
Come here.

78
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,720
Poor little thing. I know.

79
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,640
I lay not so much in your food.

80
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,960
Most of it was fine meat.
You will recover.

81
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Listen.

82
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,200
Do you like it?

83
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
Stay here.

84
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,160
I left her.

85
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,680
She is weird, Kathleen.

86
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,920
She's always weird.

87
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,080
- Are you mad at me?
- Why?

88
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,160
For small items that you two went away?

89
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,440
You're a clever girl, Kathleen.

90
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,120
You become a good wife.

91
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,960
Can you imagine what the Baron had
say if he saw her behavior?

92
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,320
- Did you see her?
- If I saw her?

93
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,640
Is it possible?

94
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,720
Are you flattered?

95
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,840
But do not act like a blackguard.

96
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,240
You are just a charming cavalier
running away from a lady.

97
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,720
As you can see
so I hurried blowing

98
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,640
to be with the lady
that I had abandoned.

99
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,240
Why do you wear your livery on
Midsummer Night? Promptly remove it.

100
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,760
Then I get to go to my room.
My black coat hanging there.

101
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,320
Go to your room then.

102
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,089
I'm going with and look to
that you are not running away from me again.

103
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:14,914
Miss Julie! With your permission -
I can go get it?

104
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,240
Kathleen, are you and John got engaged?

105
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,880
Engaged?

106
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,160
You seem so intimate.

107
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,600
In a way.
We call it that.

108
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,760
- Do you call it?
- Is not Miss also engaged?

109
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Miss Julie, I'm tired.
Can I go to my room and...?

110
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,040
<i>Très gentil, Monsieur John.
Très gentil.</i>

111
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,360
<i>Vous voulez plaisanter, madame.</i>

112
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,800
<i>Et vous voulez parler francais.</i>

113
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,520
- Where did you learn to speak French?
- In Switzerland.

114
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,480
I was sommeliers
at a hotel in Lucerne.

115
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,400
<i>You look like a perfect gentleman.
Charmant.</i>

116
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,320
- You flatter me.
- Why would I flatter you?

117
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,080
My modesty forbids me to faithfully

118
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,920
that you would give to me
so honest compliments.

119
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:13,080
So I guess you flattered me
or worse, was condescending.

120
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,440
Where did you learn to speak so?

121
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,800
You had been surprised
all the places I have visited.

122
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:27,880
- But you are born in this neighborhood, huh?
- My father worked the land over there.

123
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,120
I visited your garden
long before I started working for the Baron.

124
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,920
I saw you when you were a little girl.

125
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,160
But you, Miss Julie, did not see me.

126
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,280
Who gave you permission
to walk in our garden?

127
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,400
I remember once...

128
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,760
No. I will not tell it.

129
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,880
- Is it offensive?
- No.

130
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,760
But Kathleen can hear me.

131
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,360
From his room?

132
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,400
I think she snores.

133
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,680
She does not.
But she talks in her sleep.

134
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,240
How do you know?

135
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,080
Why do not you sit?

136
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,480
It would not be fitting
before Miss Julie.

137
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,240
- If I command you to do it then?
- Then I'll obey.

138
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,360
Give me something to drink.

139
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,880
I do not know what we have in the icebox.
I think it's just beer.

140
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,800
My tastes are simple.

141
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,480
I want beer.

142
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,760
- Miss Julie.
- Thank you. Will not you drink?

143
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,600
I do not like beer,
but if you command me...

144
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,440
A gallant should be well
keep his lady companion?

145
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,000
It's true.

146
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,680
Drink my bowl.

147
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,440
Are you shy?

148
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,200
For your health, Miss Julie.

149
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,760
Bravo.

150
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,200
Kiss now my shoe,
for it to be just right.

151
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,880
Excellent.

152
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,040
You would have become actor.

153
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,960
This is not acceptable.

154
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,000
Miss Julie. Someone might see us.

155
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,280
- What would it do?
- They had begun to talk.

156
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,400
You should have heard them when we danced.

157
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,240
What did they say? Put yourself.

158
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,440
- Tell.
- You're not a child.

159
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,240
When you see a lady drinking alone
with a valet at night...

160
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,080
We are not alone. Kathleen is here.
We pick her.

161
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,760
Let her be!

162
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,840
- Huh?
- Do not disturb the sleeper.

163
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,920
She has stood by the stove all day and
even prepared food for your dog.

164
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,240
She deserves his rest.

165
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,600
What kind you are.

166
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,560
Shall we go and pick lilacs?

167
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,920
I can not do it.
Absolutely not.

168
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,320
I command you.

169
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,560
Go.

170
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,120
Excuse me, Miss Julie.

171
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,280
She got sick of soup
as you asked me to give her.

172
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,440
And I gave her barely anything.
It could have killed her.

173
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,600
I like to take her out in the sun.

174
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,560
She loves to run around
in circles in the grass.

175
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,320
Then she lies on the hot
stone staircase with the sun on your back.

176
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
I understand.

177
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,400
You can keep her.

178
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,520
The Johns. Take the rest.

179
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,080
I sent him out
to pick flowers for me.

180
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,000
Syrener.

181
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,320
Miss Julie, I'm tired.

182
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,080
And if you do not need me more,
can I get to sleep?

183
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,720
Why did not you go out
in the garden with me?

184
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,400
I do not understand what you are afraid of.

185
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,680
My father is not even at home
and the other people...

186
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,120
They are hired to work here,
you.

187
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,640
Do you think they would believe
I'm in love with a bejänt?

188
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,200
These things happen.

189
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,240
- It's possible.
- Which imagination.

190
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,280
I can come down.

191
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,320
Not step down, Miss Julie.
When they say that you fell.

192
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,920
You guys are weird.

193
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,680
So are you. Life is strange.

194
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,160
People - everything.

195
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,680
We are just foam that floats
water until we drop.

196
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,360
Sometimes I dream that I'm up
on a pillar and can not come down.

197
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,040
I almost faint when I look down,
but I must come down.

198
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm so afraid of falling.

199
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:59,440
I can not keep myself longing
after the fall, but I do not fall.

200
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,240
No peace, no rest
until I come down.

201
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,800
I had stepped down, I had fallen.

202
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,600
And if I hit the ground
I want to get further down.

203
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,440
Deep in the ground itself.

204
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,080
Have you ever felt this way?

205
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,120
No...

206
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:39,280
I dream that I below
a tall tree in a dark forest.

207
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,000
I want to climb the top-

208
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,080
- and look out over the bright landscape
where the sun skiner-

209
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,680
- so that I can raid the nest
where the golden eggs is.

210
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,120
And I climb and climb,
but the trunk is so thick and health

211
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,080
and that's as far
to the first branch.

212
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,440
But I know that if I
can reach the first grenen-

213
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,800
-so I would easily reach the top.

214
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,480
I have not reached it yet...

215
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,440
That first branch,
but I will do it.

216
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,560
If it just gets in my dreams.

217
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,440
Are you ever afraid to hear
that you are no longer required?

218
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,440
That you do not belong?

219
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,400
I shared a bed with my little brother
and one morning when I was eight.

220
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,400
I woke up and found him dead
beside me.

221
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:08,040
I saw death for the first time
and was scared, but not as you think.

222
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,040
My little brother in his open coffin.

223
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,800
The chill crept into my spine then.

224
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,720
It is always there. It is in me.

225
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,520
I never go back
to the one I was born into.

226
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,400
Where I belonged.

227
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,120
We pick nine midsummer flowers
and put them under our pillows-

228
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,480
- so go all our dreams
true.

229
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,585
- What do you have in your eye?
- A little soil, it will disappear soon.

230
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,610
Sit down.

231
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,480
Sit still.

232
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,360
Cross. I think you shake.

233
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,760
<i>Careful.
Je ne suis qu'un homme.</i>

234
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,280
Sit still.

235
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
Yes.

236
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,360
Now it's gone.

237
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,720
Kiss my hand and say thank you.

238
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,280
Kathleen is near. Listen to me.

239
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,320
- Kiss my hand first.
- Listen to me.

240
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,920
- Blame yourself then.
- For what?

241
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,440
Are you a child?

242
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,200
- You are playing with fire.
- No, I'm dreaming.

243
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,920
It makes you not.

244
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,760
Ashamed.
I said ashamed, John!

245
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,120
- Did you know?
- Yes.

246
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,240
I'm tired of this game
and want to go and work.

247
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,960
Baron comes home tomorrow
and want to have their boots polished.

248
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,240
Stop!

249
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,600
- I forbid it. Set them down.
- No, it is my duty.

250
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,280
He is a good master
and I'm not your playmate.

251
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,600
Polish my shoes first.

252
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,720
- Jeez, what you are proud.
- In some ways and not in others.

253
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,040
Pour a drink for us.
A strong - a midsommarnattssup.

254
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,320
I'll empty the glass in one gulp.

255
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,560
Thank you, John. IT'S SO KIND OF YOU.

256
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,320
Have you ever been in love?

257
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,800
We do not use that word,
but I have enjoyed many girls.

258
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,960
One time when I did not get a girl
I wanted, I became ill.

259
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,040
Seriously ill, as a prince in a Fairy tale

260
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,760
who can not eat or drink
because of love.

261
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,320
Who was it?

262
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,640
It was you.

263
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,000
Do you know what the world looks
from my site? No, you do not.

264
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,440
You are like hawks and falcons
hovering high in the sky.

265
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,680
Their backs are seldom seen,
for just hovers there.

266
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,320
Come.

267
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,240
Come with me.

268
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,760
Do you see?

269
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,360
It's like
to have their own secret world.

270
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,600
Tell me about your home.

271
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,800
There must be a limitless accident
to be poor.

272
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,160
Oh, Miss Julie...

273
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,080
A dog can lie
in a countess sofa.

274
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,800
A horse can get cloudy caressed
of a young lady's hand

275
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,280
but A farmhand...

276
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,120
Yes, yes...

277
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,680
My home...

278
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,320
There is a koja-

279
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,880
- far out there in the gray wasteland
where there is growing a single tree.

280
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,080
You can not see it from here,
not even from the top. It is hidden.

281
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,240
Sometimes that boy
I was drawn to ensure your castle.

282
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,800
Era gardens.

283
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,920
When I got close enough
I saw the wall around your park.

284
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,400
In the evenings I climbed
on the wall to see your home.

285
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,000
It was much more beautiful than the church.

286
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,120
I had never been inside it-

287
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,440
- But my thoughts than was later
in life so they returned always there.

288
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,560
I'm sitting on the wall,
shaded by trees and covered with kaprifol-

289
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,320
- I saw people come and go
as if they were kings and emperors.

290
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,920
And I knew that the world
would never be mine.

291
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,200
And then one day...

292
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,240
I saw a pink dress
and a pair of white socks.

293
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,640
I saw you - go around among the lilies.

294
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:09,320
Yes... I fell in love.

295
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,440
I wanted to talk to you. I wanted...

296
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,960
touch you.

297
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,040
And I tänkte-

298
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,280
- That if a thief can now enter
in heaven and be with änglarna-

299
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,920
- why can not a country boy
I be in the Baron's garden-

300
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,520
-and playing with his daughter?

301
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,080
Next Sunday I washed myself
with soap and hot water

302
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,760
put on my best clothes and went
to the church, where I got to see you again.

303
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,480
I saw you.
Yes, Miss Julie, I saw you.

304
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,120
And I went home
determined to die.

305
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,080
But I wanted to die beautifully
and peaceful, but someone pain.

306
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,400
Then I remembered that it is dangerous
sleeping under an elderberry bush.

307
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,520
And I knew if a large,
in full bloom.

308
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,280
I picked all the flowers
and prepared a bed of oat coffin.

309
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,160
I lay down
and pulled the cover over me...

310
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,280
and closed my eyes.

311
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,600
I fell asleep on the toxic fläderblommorna-

312
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,840
- and woke
as a very sick boy.

313
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,840
But I did not die, as you see.

314
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,080
And I knew
I never could get you.

315
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,560
You're all that I can never get.

316
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,720
You speak as...

317
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,080
that I read in my books.

318
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,320
- Have you gone to school?
- Not much.

319
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,920
But I have read a lot
and gone on theater

320
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,600
and I have listened
at finer folks call.

321
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,320
I try even
to speak like them.

322
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,120
- Do you listen to what we say?
- Yes, and I've heard a lot.

323
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,480
When I drove the cart for you or
rowed the boat to you and your friend.

324
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,440
- What? Tell us.
- It would not be easy to repeat.

325
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,400
I was surprised. I did not understand
where you could have taught you such words.

326
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,520
Maybe it's not such a big difference
on people who you think.

327
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,560
- May I go to bed now?
- Go to bed at midsummer night?

328
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,280
Dancing with the mob out there
attracts me.

329
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,640
Good night, Miss Julie. Sleep well.

330
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,640
Download boat and row me out on the lake.
I want to look at the sun.

331
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,040
- Would it be wise?
- Do you fear for your reputation?

332
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,280
I do not want to be ridiculed
and discharged without recommendation.

333
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,885
- Maybe I owe Kathleen something.
- Are you afraid of Kathleen?

334
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:31,280
- Go to bed.
- You command me now?

335
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,240
Yes, for once
and for your own sake.

336
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,920
The night is far screed. You have
drunk and do not know what you do.

337
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,240
They come to look for me.
I may not be found here with you.

338
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,720
I love them and they love me.
Let them come, you'll see.

339
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,000
No, Miss Julie,
they do not like you.

340
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,160
They take your food and your money
and spits after you.

341
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:06,800
- Why? I have never hurt them.
- The mob is always a coward.

342
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,560
They are falskhjärtade.

343
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,120
In these kinds of situations,
one can only flee. We flees.

344
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,160
- Where to? To my room?
- No, to my.

345
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,560
We are safe there.
I'll take care of you.

346
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,000
- If they're there?
- I joists door.

347
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,080
- If they hit it then?
- I shoot.

348
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,960
Come. Come on!

349
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,680
- Do you promise to...
- I promise!

350
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,200
I do not know who I am.

351
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,280
I do not know who you are.

352
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,880
It does not know me either.

353
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:48,400
Do not you know who I am?
Did you say that?

354
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,440
No.

355
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,680
No, what?

356
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,560
Come away.

357
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,960
Your hand in mine.

358
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,920
That I did not tell you.

359
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,240
Then when I saw you in the garden.

360
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,720
I sat for hours on the wall and
looked at the house until the sun went down.

361
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,240
And then...
You may despise me now-

362
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,160
- but I did it
I had never dared to do.

363
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,680
I jumped down the other side.

364
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:25,120
In the hope that you would come out again
so I got to talk to you.

365
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,880
I do not know what I was thinking, but
knew I did not belong there.

366
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,560
I was very afraid, Miss Julie.

367
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:36,520
I knew who I was.

368
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,600
A boy who found his brother
starved in sängen-

369
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,320
- And my father told me
never to tease his grace.

370
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,680
What kind baron had been against us.

371
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,960
I must leave you garden. The
was forbidden and father would be angry.

372
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,480
Then I saw someone coming.

373
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,320
It was the Baron.

374
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,320
My heart was pounding.

375
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,360
I rushed through the raspberry thicket.

376
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,880
Thorns tore me
and the thorns stuck in my feet.

377
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,920
A week later I saw you again.

378
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:33,680
You went round among the roses.
In such deep thoughts.

379
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,240
You looked so lonely, even unhappy.

380
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,320
You did not see me.

381
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,840
I wish that you had done it.

382
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,080
Please do. I beg you.

383
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,080
Forgive me. Forgive me.

384
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,960
You do not understand.

385
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,040
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

386
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,240
I can not stay here anymore.

387
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:42,040
Stay in the room until I've
ensured that Kathleen did not see you.

388
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,320
Kathleen, please.

389
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,680
Please Kathleen.

390
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,840
Please, stay here.

391
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,760
Just a little while. Stop here.

392
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,720
There are things
I have no control now.

393
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,280
I can not control the Miss Julie.

394
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,480
No, do not talk.
Wait. I'll talk.

395
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,280
I come back, I promise.

396
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,280
Stay in here now, Kathleen.
For me.

397
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,840
And for us.

398
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:09,320
Try to sleep.

399
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,640
Please, you need to sleep.

400
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,000
Kathleen might have heard us.

401
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,560
I think she knows.

402
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:41,840
What should we do?
John, what should we do?

403
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,520
We?

404
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,240
We...

405
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:10,560
We have done what everyone is doing.
It's midsummer night, Miss Julie.

406
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,320
Between midnight and dawn may
loving open hearts and countries.

407
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:21,400
Listen, we... we can accommodate.
Travel - far from here.

408
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,680
- Travel?
- Far away. To Switzerland.

409
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:31,440
For the Italian lakes. Lake Como.
I have been there. There I said before.

410
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,680
Life has given us an answer. It is
a miracle. I have a picture here.

411
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,240
That's life.
Always new faces.

412
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,640
Never a moment of worry, no need
wondering what to get to.

413
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,160
People dancing day and night,
trains visslar-

414
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,840
- and all the time guldmynts jingles.
That's life, Julie.

415
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,400
Eternal summer. Orange trees. Laurel tree.

416
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:03,120
I open a first class hotel with first class
guests.

417
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,560
- A hotel?
- Yes, it will be our life.

418
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:12,160
You will be the hotel's decoration. With
your appearance and your style is given.

419
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:17,600
You will never be alone again.
I'll take care of you.

420
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,960
I promise. Freedom.
No more walls or gardens.

421
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:26,720
You will sit there like a queen
and control the slaves with a clock.

422
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,440
Guests defilerar beyond your belief
and leave their offerings.

423
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,000
People will tremble
when they hold out a bills

424
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,320
and you humor them
with your beautiful smile.

425
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,480
One day I'm as rich as your father.
I might even buy him out.

426
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:52,560
Say that you love me.
Otherwise, I am nothing.

427
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:57,520
Not now, not here. Absolutely no
feelings, because then all is lost.

428
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,160
Cold Blood, clear heads,
adults.

429
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,480
We sit at the table. You there.

430
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,360
I'm sitting here and we'll talk
as if nothing had happened between us.

431
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:21,120
- Have you no feelings at all?
- No one is more emotional than I am.

432
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,840
For a little while ago, you held me.
I lay in your bed...

433
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,480
- Now we have other things to think about.
- Do not speak unkindly to me!

434
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:36,200
We have made a mistake, a big one.
It would be foolish to do another one.

435
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:42,200
Before the Baron will
I need to know: do you believe in me?

436
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,640
How do we do all this?
We have no money.

437
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,320
It's true.

438
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,400
I want you to become my partner.
I need your money.

439
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,800
I have no money.
I own nothing himself.

440
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,360
That settles it.

441
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:15,080
Do you think I'll stay in this house
which your woman?

442
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:21,640
Do you think I let people touch
finger at me and laugh at me?

443
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,560
That I can see my father in the eye?
What have I done?

444
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:29,880
Do not bother with it.
Turn off the fountain!

445
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:34,440
- Do you even know what love is?
- I?! That God knows.

446
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,040
- Do you think it's my first time?
- Now you despise me.

447
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:42,240
Do not pretend to be nervous
and does not pretend to be special.

448
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:46,040
We are equals now.

449
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,920
Look here, my little friend.

450
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:06,080
Let me invite you
in a glass with something extra nice.

451
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,680
- Where did you find this?
- In the basement.

452
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:22,040
My father's wine?

453
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,280
Is not good enough for his son in law?

454
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:31,240
- Thief.
- Are you going to tell on me? Yes, bowl.

455
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,440
- I am so unhappy.
- Why?

456
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:41,840
Think of Kathleen. I got
forbid her to go to the kitchen.

457
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,500
- Do not you think she has feelings?
- Downstairs is downstairs.

458
01:02:45,525 --> 01:02:47,120
And a whore is a whore!

459
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,840
Oh my god, I'm so scared!

460
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,720
I'm in a dark hole
and it feels like I'm falling.

461
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,200
You're sick, young lady.

462
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,160
I really feel sorry for you.

463
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,760
When I was a little boy and surreptitiously
looked at you in trädgården-

464
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:20,400
- and saw you walking around amongst the roses
with your narrow white ankles...

465
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,880
I had the same dirty thoughts
like all young boys.

466
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:28,120
You said you wanted to die for me.
It was a lie.

467
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:32,120
It's nice talk that gets women
to spread your legs!

468
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,080
- Wretch!
- You may carry one.

469
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,852
- Now you have seen Hökens back.
- Not its back.

470
01:03:37,877 --> 01:03:40,360
- How can a soul be so dirty?
- Wash it then!

471
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:43,360
Your lackey!
Stand up when I speak with you!

472
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,560
- Stand up when I speak with you!
- Lackey? Tig, Miss whore!

473
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,440
Shut up and get out of here!
You have no right to be here!

474
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,480
Kathleen do not like
when your kind visit her kitchen.

475
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:02,120
Had she been as vulgar as you
throwing you over a man?

476
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:06,040
Where do you think you are? In a zoo?
In a horhus?

477
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,040
Yes, I'm crap - I am nothing.
I do not belong here, I know.

478
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,240
But please, help me, John.

479
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,400
I have to find a way out of this.

480
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:25,480
Please help me
to find a way out of this.

481
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:29,080
I could be part of the debt,
but do you think that I-

482
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:33,040
- would even dare to look at as you
if you had not begged for it?

483
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,800
- Please.
- I'm still taken aback.

484
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,360
Though the victory was too easy res
to be exciting.

485
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,480
Stop.

486
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:46,480
I'm sorry I said it.
I do not want to turn on an unarmed.

487
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:54,240
I can not deny
that I was delighted to upptäcka-

488
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:59,280
- that what has dazzled us
subdue it just was gaudiness.

489
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,240
That you have powder on your sore cheek.

490
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,440
And the dirt under your nails smustiga.

491
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:10,760
That your perfumed handkerchief
is dirty, Julie.

492
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,920
But it hurts me to realize
that I longed since

493
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:19,400
is so far from true.
It's nothing, it's worthless.

494
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,000
Sad that you have sunk so low,
Julie, much lower than you cook.

495
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:38,320
It makes as much pain
like to see autumn's last flowers-

496
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:44,800
- keep up with your head, wilted or
ragged by rain and made of dirt.

497
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:51,040
You speak as if you are
already standing over me.

498
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,920
I conceived of a baron.
You can never achieve it.

499
01:05:54,080 --> 01:06:00,200
It's true. But I can
beget a baron - with your help.

500
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:06,360
- You are a thief - that's not me.
- There are much worse things.

501
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,040
Anyway, I serve in an RV

502
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:14,280
and look like one of the family,
as a child in the house.

503
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:19,200
It's not theft if a child
taking a berry from a large cluster.

504
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:30,920
Miss Julie.

505
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,160
Miss Julie?

506
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,760
You are a wonderful woman
and too fine for one like me.

507
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,643
You've been drinking and lost his head
and try to hide your mistake,

508
01:06:46,668 --> 01:06:49,400
by to tell you
that you love me.

509
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:54,520
If my outer attracted you
so is your love is not better than mine.

510
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,903
I can be like your dog that you
show love when it suits re-

511
01:06:58,063 --> 01:07:01,341
- but it's not enough for me.
I will make you never love me.

512
01:07:01,366 --> 01:07:03,583
Are you so sure?

513
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,880
Do you mean that it can be possible?

514
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And I can fall in love with you?

515
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:37,600
Yes, I can.

516
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:46,880
You are beautiful. You are elegant.
I love that in a woman.

517
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:50,720
Ni is formed.
We could read together.

518
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:55,120
All the great writers.
We could discuss them.

519
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,880
The fire that you teeth in a man
does not go out.

520
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:04,080
- Your kisses are as strong spices.
- Leave me alone!

521
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,840
You are disgusting - like a rat.

522
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:21,040
I hate you.

523
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,520
Hold me then.

524
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,400
Yes, we can accommodate.

525
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:15,400
- Are you my friend?
- I am sometimes.

526
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,360
But do not trust me.

527
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,600
I need you to understand me, look at me.

528
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,600
Do not give me your life's secrets.

529
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,560
You will regret it.

530
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,120
You sound like my mother.

531
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,600
She was so beautiful.

532
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,840
Look at this picture of her.

533
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,400
She would not be a mother.

534
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,440
She smiled at me,
but did not mean it.

535
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,880
Sometimes when I think of her smile
so my mouth.

536
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,440
But I do not smile inside.

537
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,200
Do not drink more.

538
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:32,840
It's as if I was cut off
from all that is life.

539
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,960
Inside Me...

540
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,040
inside me - nothing.

541
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,760
A black hole.

542
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,720
She taught me...

543
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:59,440
to distrust and hate all men.

544
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:05,640
And I promised her
as ten-year GIRLS

545
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,440
-that I never ever-

546
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:14,000
- Could be a slave to a man.

547
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,360
I did not even understand what it meant.

548
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:29,320
- When do you hate me too.
- Yes.

549
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,120
I'd like to shoot you
like a dog.

550
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,360
Without doubts?

551
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,560
Without scruples.

552
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:54,200
But you have nothing to shoot me with.

553
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,600
And I'm no dog.

554
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,920
I'll bring you up to my room.

555
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:05,440
Then I put you in my birdcage.

556
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,960
Most of all, I would die.

557
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:21,000
Die? It's stupid.

558
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:30,600
Shore of Lake Como.
You said that the sun always shines.

559
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,880
Look at the wall out there.

560
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,320
It's the only thing you see from here.

561
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,240
You can just feel the sunlight.

562
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,560
And one can only hear the wind.

563
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:09,240
On the other side of the wall
I have a place.

564
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,680
A secret garden.

565
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,840
It blows no wind there.

566
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:27,600
I go there when I'm anxious.

567
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:33,680
I'm anxious all the time.

568
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,240
I always long
to another location.

569
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:46,640
You can not imagine how different
I wished that my life would be.

570
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:55,040
When I was little,
just after Mom died...

571
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:01,920
I was hoping
that my whole garden...

572
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,360
would be full of animals.

573
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,960
They would come from...

574
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,320
I do not know where they'd come from.

575
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,960
They would be there...

576
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,960
to watch over me.

577
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,120
I have a hole in my stomach.

578
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:38,400
I do not know
was my sadness comes from.

579
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,080
And now you...

580
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,760
You and me.

581
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,120
Yes, we have to travel.

582
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:57,360
To make each other's lives
hell?

583
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,320
No... to be happy.

584
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:05,160
And smile inwardly.

585
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:11,280
Entertain us for a few years,
as long as we can.

586
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,600
And then...

587
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,240
die.

588
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,920
Do you want to die with me?

589
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,240
I do not want to die.
I enjoy life.

590
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:34,360
- Do you refuse to die with me?
- I'm sorry, Miss Julie.

591
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,000
Say no more.
I go to bed.

592
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:40,640
You disgraced me.
You owe me anything.

593
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:54,720
Here... Thank you.

594
01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:00,000
Is this my reward for opening my
heart and donate my Atts honor?

595
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,400
- I warned you.
- You forced me.

596
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,440
You were seductress.

597
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,920
We can get married
and then we can separate us.

598
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:14,240
- I humiliate me.
- Demeans?

599
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:19,960
I so wish that it was undone.
And if you only loved me!

600
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:24,800
I told you not to drink,
for when you speak. You shall not speak.

601
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,520
A butterfly die during lovemaking.
I wish I did.

602
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:33,240
What do you want?
Should I cry with you again?

603
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:36,600
Should I kiss your feet again? What?

604
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,640
I've had enough, Miss Julie.

605
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:46,520
This hurts.

606
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:54,080
Miss Julie,
I see that you are unhappy.

607
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,880
Yes, you suffer, but...

608
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:03,080
I do not understand what you are saying.

609
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:06,000
My Kind behave not like you.

610
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:10,520
We hate and destroy not one another.
We love for fun.

611
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:15,440
It's a game we play
when we are off from work.

612
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:20,200
But we have not got all day
and the night that your kind have.

613
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,640
You know what?

614
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:46,560
I think you're sick.
Yes, I'm sure you're sick.

615
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:53,520
Be kind to me, John.
Speak to me as a human being.

616
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:58,000
Each time a man himself.

617
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:02,120
You spit on me, but will not let me
wipe it on you.

618
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:05,920
Help me then.
Tell me what to do.

619
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:10,920
- If I only knew it yourself!
- I know.

620
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:17,760
I have behaved dissolute
like I'm crazy. I know.

621
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:23,480
But now... What do I do?

622
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:29,320
Stay here and keep quiet.
No one knows.

623
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:37,040
- I can not stay here. Everyone knows.
- They do not know and never think about it.

624
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:43,360
But suppose that there are consequences.

625
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:49,200
Consequences?

626
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:55,080
Since there is only one thing to do.
You must disappear, travel immediately.

627
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,840
And you must travel alone.

628
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,920
- Alone? Where to? I can not.
- You must!

629
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,760
Before the Baron will.
If you stay, you know what happens.

630
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:11,198
Write late to your father about your accident.
He loves you and will help you.

631
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:14,840
He never guess it was me.
He may not want to know.

632
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,720
- I travel if you follow through.
- Are you crazy?!

633
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,080
Miss Julie elope with a valet?

634
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:29,720
It had been in the papers
and the baron never survive.

635
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:32,440
I'm so tired.

636
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:37,440
I'm so... incredibly tired.

637
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,960
Commit me.

638
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,960
I have to be told.

639
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:03,680
I can no longer imagine.
I can not move.

640
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,920
Do you now-

641
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,520
-who helpless creatures your kind are?

642
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:16,240
Why you strutting around
with his nose in luften-

643
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,600
- As if you were lords of creation?

644
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:24,920
I'll tell you what to do.

645
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,480
I shall command you.

646
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,880
Go to your father's library.

647
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:38,400
In his desk drawer, there is money.
Take the money.

648
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:48,160
Come with me up.

649
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:51,840
Go!

650
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:01,120
Go up there!

651
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:08,280
- Speak kindly to me.
- Commandments always sounds unfriendly.

652
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:12,520
Now you know how it feels. Go.

653
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:48,080
Can I leave my room now?

654
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,800
You look terrible.

655
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:02,440
May God forgive you.
What have you done?

656
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,520
You are my woman.

657
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:18,520
But the night is long, Kathleen.

658
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,680
All wines...

659
01:22:21,680 --> 01:22:24,680
My head was not with me,
I was dizzy.

660
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:28,640
I asked what you have done.

661
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:35,120
I have so much pain, Kathleen.
Let us hold each other.

662
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,320
No. No!

663
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:55,680
I have this clear to you.

664
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,320
To the Church.

665
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,960
You always have my things.

666
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,400
Thank you. Thank you.

667
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:29,680
You promised to accompany me today.

668
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,480
That's right, I remember now.

669
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:40,760
And here you are with my Sunday best.

670
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,360
Take me them then.

671
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:08,040
- What is today's text?
- John the Baptist's beheading.

672
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,080
You strangles me!

673
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:17,800
God, I'm so tired. So tired.

674
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:22,520
I'm exhausted.

675
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:27,600
Why did you stay up all night
then?

676
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:34,040
Have you seen your face?

677
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:39,520
Miss Julie...
She did not leave me.

678
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:44,080
Stop. And she does not know what
to suit themselves, she does not.

679
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:47,640
She talked.
She needed to talk.

680
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,040
You know how I am.

681
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,760
I always put a veil over people.

682
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,320
I glorify them.

683
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:03,160
So I never see
who they really are.

684
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:06,960
I did it with Miss Julie-

685
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:10,160
- and I had
to be disappointed.

686
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:16,080
We forced all see ourselves
less than we had hoped.

687
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:21,640
Is not it strange
when you think about it? Hon.

688
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:24,240
What is strange?

689
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,760
Everything.

690
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,600
Look me straight in the eye.

691
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,640
Yes.

692
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,360
Is it possible?

693
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,960
Is it possible?

694
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:04,880
Yes... that's it.

695
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:09,960
It's horrible!
I can tear your eyes out!

696
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:14,760
Yes, I feel for it!
It's filthy, absolutely disgusting!

697
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:18,080
- Are you mad at her?
- No, I'm mad at you!

698
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:22,320
It really was shoddily done!
Poor young woman.

699
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,280
I have to respect my mistress.

700
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:29,280
- Are you jealous of her?
- No, not at her.

701
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:33,480
If it had been Clara or Sophie
I would have been jealous.

702
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:38,440
I do not work in a house where people
can not behave decently.

703
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:42,640
Had you done that? You pulled down
yourself in the dirt by doing it.

704
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,880
Get out of here! Out!

705
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,680
- Get out of here!
- Why should you respect them?

706
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,920
Do not you know that?
If you think you're so clever.

707
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,120
It shows that they are not better than us.

708
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:02,600
Then nothing can inspire us to
themselves to get better.

709
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:07,160
Did you think about the Baron?
Think of all the sorrows he had in life.

710
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:11,680
I'm not staying here longer
and forced to look him in the eyes.

711
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,000
And with you.
Why did she do it with you?

712
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:21,600
If at least it had been with
a man of her kind, a better man.

713
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:26,840
She wanted to give the dog poison to
it ran after the Forester's rubbish.

714
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:33,800
You are good to be who you are,
but there is a difference. Class is class.

715
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,880
I'm not staying here any longer.

716
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:42,400
On October 14 we travel.
You should also be included.

717
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:46,480
You can find work as a porter
or bid at eachother authority.

718
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:51,200
The pay is lower, but it is safe. Your
widow and your children receive a pension.

719
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:55,600
Should I plan my death
so you can get a pension?

720
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:59,320
I have better prospects than
them in mind.

721
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,840
Who goes around up there?

722
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:12,760
Could it be the baron?
Already?

723
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,360
Listen.

724
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:26,080
If I travel, I never
a job like this.

725
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,920
Why should you go?

726
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:32,840
You have not seen much of the world.
Why should you go?

727
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:38,480
When the baron traveling 14 October
so will we.

728
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:48,320
We have known each other for a few years.
Do not forget your obligations.

729
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:53,800
Let's hope
to the Baron never know-

730
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:58,120
- what happened here in his betjänts
place this midsummer night.

731
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:06,760
Go straight to you. He should not
come home and see you like this.

732
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:11,040
I go out with the dog
and when I come back-

733
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:15,280
- can you and I to church
and you ask God to forgive you.

734
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:19,520
And I ask Him to help us.
All of us.

735
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:53,160
Oh my God. As you look.

736
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,920
What? How do I look?

737
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,640
You are deathly pale.

738
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:04,600
- The sun is coming up.
- And the trolls dancing.

739
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:08,120
Yes, they have danced all night.

740
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:14,560
I have the money.

741
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:18,000
- How much?
- I took the whole thing.

742
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:35,840
Please, come with me.
I can not travel alone.

743
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:42,280
Not today.
On Midsummer Day trains are overcrowded.

744
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:45,320
I can not travel exclusive.

745
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:50,680
Amid all the black
and gray on the train.

746
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:54,480
When people look at me as if they knew.

747
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:03,000
It's so beautiful out there.

748
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:06,960
Garden.

749
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,520
I showed you never
my little brook, huh?

750
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:14,920
I know you had loved it.
All my flowers.

751
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:17,280
Miss Julie.

752
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:22,320
I'm coming with you,
but it must become at once.

753
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,960
What is that?

754
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:35,320
What is it?

755
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:39,160
- It's my canary.
- Do you take with you a cage?

756
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:43,480
- I'm leaving her.
- Release the cage!

757
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:45,960
It's the only thing that I take.

758
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:49,040
Release the cage, I say!

759
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:52,120
Kathleen will at any time.

760
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:56,160
Listen.
You go out through the main entrance.

761
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:00,160
I take the servants' door.
See you out there at the gate.

762
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:05,920
Release the bird. Now!
Kathleen takes care of it.

763
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:09,960
No, my little bird,
he takes you.

764
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:13,080
- No.
- The bird, the bird!

765
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,040
Give me that!

766
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:20,880
My little bird, he takes you.

767
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:24,080
For God's sake. Quiet! Quiet!

768
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:58,240
Kill me too. Kill me.

769
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:02,680
You kill an innocent animal
without blinking.

770
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:06,680
I hate and despise you.

771
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:09,640
There is blood between us.

772
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,960
I curse the moment when I saw you.

773
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:18,440
I curse the day I was born.

774
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,080
Kill me too.

775
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,880
Do you think I can not bear to see blood?

776
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:31,040
Do you think I'm weak?

777
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:35,240
I would like to see your blood,
your brain lying there on the table!

778
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:39,360
See all your sex swimming in blood
as my little bird!

779
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,520
You think I'm weak!

780
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:45,440
You think I love you
my womb longed for your seed.

781
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,760
Do you think I want to wear
your brood over my heart

782
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,840
close it with my blood
and give it your name?

783
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,440
What is your name really?

784
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:57,720
John - and then?
What is your surname?

785
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:02,000
You may not have anything.
I am wife riding instructor, wife dung-heap.

786
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:07,200
You dog wearing my necklace!
You laborer wearing my owner's mark.

787
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:10,920
Share yourself with Kathleen,
my own kokerska-

788
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:14,120
- and all other needy women
working here.

789
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:16,880
You think I'm a coward and wants to escape.

790
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:21,280
No, I'll stay
and allows the flash knock down.

791
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:24,280
My father comes home.

792
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:28,960
He finds his desk fractured
and his money away.

793
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:37,000
When he rings the bell twice
on his man and summons polisen-

794
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:40,520
, and I tell them everything.

795
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:44,280
It'll be nice
to put an end to it.

796
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:48,040
Then get my father a stroke
and doors

797
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:51,160
and it will be the end of us all.

798
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:54,880
And everything becomes quiet,
peaceful, eternal rest.

799
01:36:55,040 --> 01:37:01,200
Baron's family goes out and Butler
dynasty continues in an orphanage.

800
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,600
Now speak royal blood.

801
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,840
Ports in the gutter
and die in prison.

802
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,760
Bravo, Miss Julie.
Ensure that the valet knows its location.

803
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:31,520
What is happening?

804
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,080
What a mess you have caused.

805
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:44,200
You are a woman, Kathleen.

806
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,800
You are my friend.

807
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:51,160
You have to understand me.

808
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:54,120
You must listen to me.

809
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:58,160
I want to know nothing of you,
Miss Julie. What is happening?

810
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:03,560
What? What?

811
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:09,360
- Kathleen, you have to understand me.
- I do not understand.

812
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:11,800
You must listen to me.

813
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:18,680
If you wish that John will go away
with you, I have to stop you both.

814
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:24,080
Tig, Kathleen, and listen to me.
I can not stay here.

815
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:31,200
John can not stay here.
We must leave here.

816
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:35,880
- Huh?
- Wait! I have an idea.

817
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:38,520
We can all three...

818
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,680
travel together abroad
and start a hotel.

819
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,560
I have money - look.

820
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,840
John and I can stand for increasingly

821
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:57,440
and you can take care of the kitchen.
Would not it be good?

822
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:03,200
Please tell me yes, Kathleen.
Come with us.

823
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,880
You must see the world.

824
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:11,400
You can not imagine
how fun it is to ride on the train.

825
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:15,080
We just talked about it.
You will love it.

826
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:19,120
Train whistles, vehicles stop.

827
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:23,480
Watches Rings - upstairs,
downstairs.

828
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:30,560
You should stand... no, you should sit
in the kitchen like a queen.

829
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:36,520
Course, you should not
stand at the stove itself.

830
01:39:36,680 --> 01:39:41,960
With all the nice clothes that you wear
to greet the guests.

831
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:46,240
You are so beautiful, Kathleen.
I flatter you.

832
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:52,040
You'll find a husband. A rich Englishman.
They are so easy to catch.

833
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:59,720
And we become rich.
We build a villa on Lake Como.

834
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,200
It's raining there.

835
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:08,080
A little... a little.

836
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,240
Sometimes.

837
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:16,640
But the sun will shine at times.

838
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:22,240
Although it looks dark.

839
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:31,320
And...

840
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:35,320
then...

841
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:43,320
Or we can go home again.

842
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:49,440
Come back here or...

843
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:55,640
elsewhere.

844
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:54,320
Think Miss Julie herself on this?

845
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,600
- If I believe in it yourself?
- Yes.

846
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:12,080
I do not know.

847
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:16,080
I do not know anything anymore.

848
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,960
Nothing. Nothing at all.

849
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,440
So you thought accommodate?

850
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,240
Escaping? It is too much to say.

851
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:37,920
You heard the lady. Maybe she's tired
after having been up all night-

852
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:41,720
But it's a plan that can engage.

853
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:50,280
You mean I should become a cook,
for her? Her?

854
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:55,960
Talk more gracefully when you speak
before your mistress. Do you understand?

855
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:59,240
Oh my God, listen to you.

856
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:06,360
It would be better for you to listen
bit more and talk less.

857
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:11,440
She's your mistress.

858
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:17,520
If you despise her for what she has done
, you despise yourself.

859
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:24,280
- I always thought I myself.
- And looked down on others.

860
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:27,960
I have never done anything
in my position.

861
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:33,080
The Baron's cook has never been
with renowned author and swine farm hand.

862
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:37,520
That's right, you had me.
It was very lucky for you.

863
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,920
Lucky? A man who steals from the baron?

864
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:46,040
Are you going to say.

865
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:49,800
You who can not even respect
your own mistress anymore.

866
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:56,120
John.

867
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:01,880
Are you coming to church with me?
You would need a good sermon.

868
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:06,080
No.

869
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,760
I'm not going to church today.

870
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:14,360
Walk alone and confess your sins.

871
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:21,280
Yes. I'll do that.

872
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:26,320
And come home with forgiveness
so it is enough for you too.

873
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:30,200
Jesus suffered and died on the cross
for us.

874
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:37,160
If we go to him with open heart
so he takes upon himself our sins.

875
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:44,440
Do you really think about it, Kathleen?

876
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:50,360
I have believed in it all my life.

877
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:54,640
Why I stand here now
with my childhood faith.

878
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:06,240
"Where sin abounds,
which abounds grace more."

879
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:12,600
Oh, if only I had your faith.

880
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:27,760
It is not given to everyone
without God's special grace.

881
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:31,720
Everyone deserves not.

882
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:34,880
Who provided it then?

883
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:41,600
Only God knows that.

884
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,160
It is a nådaverk, Miss Julie.

885
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:52,200
God has no partiality Personen-

886
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:56,440
- but where will they last
to be the main.

887
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:06,440
As he helps the outermost then?

888
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:11,840
And it is easier for a camel
to go through a nålsöga-

889
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,640
- than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven.

890
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:22,000
So it's just, Miss Julie.

891
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,280
Well then...

892
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:39,040
I go - alone.

893
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:45,320
When I go past the stableboy
should I say to him-

894
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:48,120
-that does not emit hästarna-

895
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:52,680
- If anyone would like to travel
before the baron comes home.

896
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:02,560
Goodbye.

897
01:47:23,080 --> 01:47:27,680
- What would you do in my place?
- In your place?

898
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,520
Let me see...

899
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:35,800
As välboren, as a woman...

900
01:47:35,960 --> 01:47:41,400
After such a mistake,
as one who has fallen...

901
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:47,280
I do not know.

902
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:03,600
Jo.

903
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:24,640
I know.

904
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:52,280
- This?
- Yes.

905
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:00,480
But I would not do it.

906
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,520
I would not.

907
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:08,960
Do you understand?

908
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:14,520
There is a difference between us.

909
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:25,120
There is the same difference
as between man and woman.

910
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:36,160
That's about a rich person
not going to heaven is a lie, huh?

911
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:54,520
Baron is back.
God, what if Kathleen...

912
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:57,360
He has seen his desk.

913
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,200
Yes, John, your grace.

914
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,800
Yes, Your Honor.

915
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:06,960
Instantly.

916
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:10,000
About half an hour, your grace.

917
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:12,560
Yes, yes, about half an hour.

918
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:32,520
He called for his boots.
He wants to have coffee for half an hour.

919
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:36,200
Half an hour.

920
01:50:44,040 --> 01:50:48,480
I'm exhausted.
I do not know what to do.

921
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:52,680
Fly, stay, live...

922
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:55,440
die.

923
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:02,040
You know what I want to do, but
I do not know how I'll do it.

924
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:05,920
Force me.

925
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:13,760
Commit me.
I obey you like a dog.

926
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:16,320
I can not.

927
01:51:19,120 --> 01:51:22,080
I do not know why.

928
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:26,080
It's like the
I wear this coat.

929
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:30,360
I can not command you.

930
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:34,840
I heard the Baron's voice just now.

931
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:40,000
I can not explain it.

932
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:48,160
God, it's the damn farmhand
sitting on my back.

933
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:55,400
I do as I'm told.

934
01:51:55,560 --> 01:52:00,040
If the Baron came down here now and
told me to cut my throat...

935
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:04,520
I would have done it in place.

936
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:08,080
Pretend when you are he.

937
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:12,680
And pretend I'm you.

938
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:19,120
Have you seen a magician at the theater?

939
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:24,440
The Wizard says:
"Do everything I tell you."

940
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:27,120
And she does as she is told.

941
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:31,440
He says... "take the broom."

942
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:35,280
And she takes it.

943
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:40,600
He says "sweep" and she sweeps.

944
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:49,320
I see silver and gold
and all the stars.

945
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:54,280
Like when I went to sleep as a child.

946
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:57,240
I float out the window
and up to the sky.

947
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:02,280
Such freedom,
surrounded by sparkling crystals.

948
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:09,000
And the darkness is no longer dark.

949
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:15,560
The entire room is warm and safe
as an open fire.

950
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:18,720
It's you.

951
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:21,760
And I'm close to the fire.

952
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:26,920
So nice and warm it is.

953
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:33,080
And it's so quiet.

954
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:36,560
And so brightly.

955
01:53:56,200 --> 01:53:58,800
Here is the broom.

956
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:03,480
Go to the barn.

957
01:54:03,640 --> 01:54:05,840
Use.

958
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,320
Go now while it is bright.

959
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:12,280
Go through the tunnel
lest you meet your father.

960
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,240
Thank you.

961
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:26,360
Say that the main
also can receive the gift of grace.

962
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:33,800
- Say it, even if you do not believe it.
- The premier?

963
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:37,120
No, I can not do it.

964
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:43,000
But wait...

965
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:47,440
Miss Julie, now I know.

966
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:52,720
You're no longer
among the best.

967
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:56,920
You are among the most extreme.

968
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:02,280
I am one of the ultimate.

969
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:33,400
And the main
school can be the ultimate.

970
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:40,600
Do not speak, do not think. Do not think.

971
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:48,200
Go, Miss Julie.
There is no other way.

972
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:51,120
Go.

973
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,320
Wait!

974
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:57,960
<i>I'm sending you out in the world.</i>

975
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:06,200
<i>Watch.
You're like colorful stars.</i>

976
01:59:07,480 --> 01:59:10,360
<i>The water is your heaven.</i>

977
01:59:12,120 --> 01:59:15,360
<i>Do you know it, my flowers?</i>

978
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:19,000
<i>Yes.</i>

979
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:24,400
<i>Everything is so much greater than
the small portions.</i>

980
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:29,360
<i>Do you know that?</i>
