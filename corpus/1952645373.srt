it appears that he was
the better man, no?

Kaitan was not actually working
against his will

is such a dangerous place.

in the raid.

for Abu Sayyaf.

You know, this whole situation
with Oaptain Fierson

690
00:48:11,135 --> 00:48:12,466

744
00:51:42,212 --> 00:51:44,544
l'll speak to them.

745
00:51:44,581 --> 00:51:46,572
Everyone hide in the galley.

746
00:51:46,617 --> 00:51:48,448
l can take care of this.

747
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:56,657
Good day, boys.

748
00:51:56,693 --> 00:51:58,160
- You the only one here?

749
00:51:58,195 --> 00:51:59,184
- Right.

750
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:02,687
Just me, myself, and l.

751
00:52:02,733 --> 00:52:04,360
What's the big deal?

752
00:52:12,976 --> 00:52:15,206
- Kaitan told me you'd fight.

753
00:52:15,245 --> 00:52:17,213
- Why should l trust you?

754
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:19,238
- Haven't you seen the news?

755
00:52:19,283 --> 00:52:21,148
They're calling me a traitor.

756
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:24,018
They're framing me
just like they're framing you.

757
00:52:24,054 --> 00:52:27,148
They want us dead.

758
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:32,458
Now l need you and l need
that chip to clear my name,

759
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:35,021
to clear both our names.

760
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:46,406
- Shit, they're coming.

761
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,479
thud!

762
00:52:58,522 --> 00:53:00,353
- Oh!

763
00:53:03,093 --> 00:53:05,186
[thudding]

764
00:53:14,438 --> 00:53:15,496
- See?

765
00:53:15,539 --> 00:53:17,871
Nothing here.

766
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:19,739
Beautiful day.

767
00:53:19,776 --> 00:53:21,869
- What's in there?

768
00:53:23,413 --> 00:53:24,778
[gunshot]

769
00:53:24,815 --> 00:53:27,045
[punching sounds]

770
00:53:27,084 --> 00:53:28,381
[man grunts]

771
00:53:31,455 --> 00:53:32,649
- Ooh!

772
00:53:32,689 --> 00:53:35,089
[splashing]

773
00:53:40,264 --> 00:53:43,062
- Oan you guys untie me now?

774
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:46,398
[rain hissing]

775
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:55,742
- We'll take that boat.

776
00:53:55,779 --> 00:53:58,043
There's an island not far
from here

777
00:53:58,081 --> 00:54:00,379
where we can hide out
the rest of night,

778
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:04,979
maybe head to Mindoro
tomorrow morning.

779
00:54:05,022 --> 00:54:06,717
Got a cousin there
who can help us.

780
00:54:06,757 --> 00:54:08,952
- Jesus, what's the plan?

781
00:54:08,992 --> 00:54:10,687
Are we island hopping?

782
00:54:10,727 --> 00:54:11,887
We got to get back
to Oebu.

783
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:12,987
- No.

784
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:15,089
Everyone's looking for us
in Oebu.

785
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:17,657
- Yeah, and there's only one
road in and out of this town.

786
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:21,432
Bet Abu Sayyaf are following me.

787
00:54:21,471 --> 00:54:22,904
We'll take that boat.

788
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:25,534
[engine starts up]

789
00:54:29,713 --> 00:54:32,147
She's all yours, Oaptain.

790
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,615
- l don't feel good
about this.

791
00:54:35,652 --> 00:54:38,621
We can't just
leave civilization.

792
00:54:38,655 --> 00:54:41,749
- The newscast got you
all crazy, huh,

793
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:44,488
thinking about
that big cash reward?

794
00:54:44,528 --> 00:54:45,756
- Hey, are you loco?

795
00:54:45,796 --> 00:54:49,459
l don't know
what you're talking about.

796
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:51,364
- Let me ask you something.

797
00:54:51,401 --> 00:54:54,666
Were you gonna turn us in
to Abu Sayyaf or the Americans?

798
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:57,003
- What? No, man.

799
00:54:58,141 --> 00:54:59,836
[splashing]

800
00:55:03,146 --> 00:55:05,512
- l hope he can swim.

801
00:55:08,485 --> 00:55:10,180
- That's my cousin.

802
00:55:19,363 --> 00:55:22,025
- So l've been meaning
to ask you,

803
00:55:22,065 --> 00:55:24,693
how did you get out of there,

804
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:26,293
off that island?

805
00:55:26,336 --> 00:55:30,238
- Well, it wasn't so hard
after you killed everyone.

806
00:55:34,711 --> 00:55:36,736
Plus l'm pretty sure
l blend in with the locals

807
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,042
a little bit better than you do.

808
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:41,573
- You still
don't fucking get it, do you?

809
00:55:41,618 --> 00:55:43,813
l was doing my job.

810
00:55:43,854 --> 00:55:45,481
- Then why didn't you save
the doctor,

811
00:55:45,522 --> 00:55:47,717
an American?

812
00:55:49,459 --> 00:55:51,552
Wasn't our primary objective.

813
00:55:54,064 --> 00:55:57,556
- ''Primary objective.''

814
00:56:07,778 --> 00:56:09,302
[knife clacking]

815
00:56:09,346 --> 00:56:12,281
l'm sorry l dragged you
into this.

816
00:56:12,315 --> 00:56:13,805
l made you an accomplice.

817
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,341
- Don't say that, Nita.

818
00:56:16,386 --> 00:56:19,321
l am a willing accomplice.

819
00:56:19,356 --> 00:56:25,386
And you are
my brilliant daughter.

820
00:56:25,429 --> 00:56:29,195
l couldn't be more proud of you.

821
00:56:29,232 --> 00:56:31,462
Everything will be fine.

822
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:33,696
We'll fix this, okay?

823
00:56:46,049 --> 00:56:48,279
- My objective hasn't changed.

824
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:51,310
l still need that chip
before we can finish this.

825
00:56:52,923 --> 00:56:54,720
l know you have it, Nita.

826
00:56:54,758 --> 00:56:56,020
- So what?

827
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:58,152
Oan you hold onto the chip?

828
00:56:58,195 --> 00:57:00,493
Do you think
you're that indestructible?

829
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:02,964
- lt's safer with me.

830
00:57:02,999 --> 00:57:04,762
You know that.

831
00:57:28,225 --> 00:57:30,659
Thank you.

832
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,747
- Relax with the gun.

833
00:57:51,782 --> 00:57:52,840
We got a deal here.

834
00:57:52,883 --> 00:57:55,351
- Where'd they go?

835
00:57:55,385 --> 00:57:57,478
Unless you're a complete fool,

836
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:59,148
you'll tell me everything
you know.

837
00:57:59,189 --> 00:58:01,248
- The money.

838
00:58:08,732 --> 00:58:10,199
Oh, yeah.

839
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:12,360
Said something about Mindoro.

840
00:58:17,274 --> 00:58:19,640
[computer beeping]

841
00:58:33,089 --> 00:58:35,284
[birds chirping]

842
00:58:38,028 --> 00:58:40,929
- Start collecting some wood
for a fire.

843
00:58:40,964 --> 00:58:43,899
- What do we need a fire for?

844
00:58:43,934 --> 00:58:46,664
- You look hungry.

845
00:58:48,738 --> 00:58:50,137
[birds calling]

846
00:58:50,173 --> 00:58:52,607
- Mmm, mmm.

847
00:58:52,642 --> 00:58:54,439
l needed this.

848
00:58:54,477 --> 00:58:56,445
l finally feel

849
00:58:56,479 --> 00:58:59,073
like my brain's working again.

850
00:58:59,115 --> 00:59:02,050
- What does that mean,
more questions?

851
00:59:02,085 --> 00:59:06,419
- Actually, yes.

852
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:08,549
Who are these mercenaries?

853
00:59:08,592 --> 00:59:10,617
Where do they come from?

854
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,560
- Military contractors.

855
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:15,793
Private armies hired
by big corporations.

856
00:59:15,832 --> 00:59:18,232
- Why do they want
to kill their own men?

857
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:20,202
- They're not my men.

858
00:59:20,237 --> 00:59:21,670
They don't answer
to our government.

859
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:24,572
They don't adhere
to our military code.

860
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:27,543
- [sighs]

861
00:59:27,577 --> 00:59:31,980
- Nita, are you okay?

862
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:34,711
- The device that we created

863
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:37,948
is just a prototype.

864
00:59:37,988 --> 00:59:41,424
The chip is literally
the first and the only one.

865
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:45,224
They knew our research could
be used for nuclear weapons.

866
00:59:45,262 --> 00:59:48,891
But Dr. Kaitan refused.

867
00:59:48,932 --> 00:59:51,059
That's why he contacted Yates
in the first place.

868
00:59:51,101 --> 00:59:52,295
- Yates?

869
00:59:52,335 --> 00:59:53,825
- Peter Yates,

870
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:55,497
his old college friend,

871
00:59:55,538 --> 00:59:57,802
the British journalist
who flew over to Hong Kong

872
00:59:57,841 --> 01:00:02,608
to interview him
the day all of this began.

873
01:00:07,951 --> 01:00:09,782
- lt's late.

874
01:00:09,819 --> 01:00:10,911
You should get some sleep.

875
01:00:10,954 --> 01:00:13,821
We got an early morning.

876
01:00:13,857 --> 01:00:16,052
l'm gonna go check
this place out,

877
01:00:16,092 --> 01:00:19,528
see if it's not safe enough
for us to get some shut-eye.

878
01:00:38,615 --> 01:00:40,674
- [snoring]

879
01:00:44,654 --> 01:00:48,181
- His whole life has been
all about taking care of me.

880
01:00:48,224 --> 01:00:50,454
l'm all he's got.

881
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:53,587
- What about your mom?

882
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:58,624
- l only know her through
his stories and memories.

883
01:00:58,668 --> 01:01:01,728
She died when l was born.

884
01:01:01,771 --> 01:01:03,830
Take the trip to Manila
once a month,

885
01:01:03,873 --> 01:01:07,309
visit her grave
and bring her fresh flowers.

886
01:01:07,344 --> 01:01:09,904
l do it now too.

887
01:01:09,946 --> 01:01:12,972
Tell her my problems.

888
01:01:13,016 --> 01:01:14,313
[sniffs]

889
01:01:14,351 --> 01:01:17,081
Swear l could feel a presence.

890
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,681
- Well, it sounds to me
like you had a good family.

891
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:24,353
[fire crackling]

892
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,227
[computer beeps]

893
01:01:35,238 --> 01:01:37,331
[door opens]

894
01:01:39,242 --> 01:01:40,436
- Let me guess.

895
01:01:40,477 --> 01:01:43,207
You're back again,
empty-handed.

896
01:01:43,246 --> 01:01:46,113
- Look, we know
where he's going.

897
01:01:46,149 --> 01:01:49,448
- Yeah, yeah, we know
where he's going, uh-huh.

898
01:01:49,486 --> 01:01:50,646
Let's just finish it, okay?

899
01:01:50,687 --> 01:01:53,121
lt's bad enough already.

900
01:01:54,257 --> 01:01:57,249
[insects chirping]

901
01:01:58,895 --> 01:02:01,693
- Oan't you sleep, soldier?

902
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:04,359
- lt's Yates.

903
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:08,667
Kaitan ever get
to talk to him?

904
01:02:08,705 --> 01:02:09,899
- No.

905
01:02:09,939 --> 01:02:13,636
He was kidnapped
after his interview.

906
01:02:13,676 --> 01:02:15,439
- Well, that's it, then.

907
01:02:15,478 --> 01:02:18,276
We get the chip to Yates,
he could write our story.

908
01:02:18,314 --> 01:02:21,215
- He's all the way back
in London.

909
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:22,775
We need to get to him.

910
01:02:22,819 --> 01:02:25,413
- But you're getting ahead
of yourself there, Nita.

911
01:02:27,157 --> 01:02:30,354
We have to get the chip before
we get it to Yates, don't we?

912
01:02:30,393 --> 01:02:32,156
- l gave it to you already.

913
01:02:32,195 --> 01:02:35,187
- You mixed it with a decoy.

914
01:02:35,231 --> 01:02:37,699
- What are you talking about?

915
01:02:37,734 --> 01:02:39,964
What makes you think
that's a decoy?

916
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,974
What the hell
did you do that for?

917
01:02:46,009 --> 01:02:47,977
- Don't play games, Nita.

918
01:02:48,011 --> 01:02:50,241
- [sighs]

919
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:58,714
- Sorry about Dr. Kaitan.

920
01:02:58,755 --> 01:03:01,849
Sounds like he was a good man.

921
01:03:05,328 --> 01:03:06,920
- He was.

922
01:03:32,055 --> 01:03:33,317
- All right.

923
01:03:35,892 --> 01:03:38,861
