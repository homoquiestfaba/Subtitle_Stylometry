00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:08,348
about the young lady coming for
the photography retreat.

177
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,942
No. Did you get mine
about the young man?

178
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,853
There seems to have been
a slight mix-up.

179
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:15,355
We'll be right over.

180
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:17,932
- Oh, no.
- I don't...

181
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,784
Hung up. Great

182
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:24,105
since I was here first,

183
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:26,273
I'm sure they can help you
get settled somewhere else.

184
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,853
Or... and this is
just a thought here...

185
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:31,463
Um, you could go
somewhere else.

186
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,857
Yeah, see,
I'm here from New York.

187
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,616
I'm a fashion photographer.

188
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,045
Yeah, I'm actually here visiting
for a photography retreat.

189
00:10:39,197 --> 00:10:40,138
As am I.

190
00:10:40,365 --> 00:10:42,623
No kidding.

191
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:46,536
Sean Daniels.
<i> Wildlife weekly.</i>

192
00:10:46,554 --> 00:10:48,480
Gaby Jones.

193
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,299
Wildlife photography.
Interesting.

194
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:54,060
Fashion photography.

195
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,320
Less interesting.

196
00:10:59,308 --> 00:11:01,308
- Hot chocolate?
- [Water running]

197
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:05,146
I was just about to make some
before you broke in.

198
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,740
I had the code.

199
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:10,410
No, thanks, all right? I'll just
wait for them to get here.

200
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,670
Suit yourself.

201
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,341
[Sighs]

202
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:24,590
So have you been
to this retreat before?

203
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,426
No. First time.

204
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,762
I see. You know,
I've wanted to come for years,

205
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:32,098
but somehow I'm always
out on assignment.

206
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,601
Last year at this time,
I believe it was...

207
00:11:35,754 --> 00:11:38,012
Ah. The Siberian tigers.

208
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,439
Oh, exciting.

209
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,449
Oh, very.

210
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,872
Mm-mm-mm. Are you sure
you don't want any?

211
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:50,099
I mean, it's absolutely
delicious.

212
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:51,601
I got the cocoa
from when I was in Ghana,

213
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:54,195
shooting the patas monkeys.

214
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:57,290
- It's too sweet for me.
- Mmm.

215
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,801
- [Vehicle approaches]
- Oh, good, they're here.

216
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,887
Settle this once and for all.

217
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:06,891
We brought you guys
some groceries.

218
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:08,393
Thought it was the least
we could do.

219
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:10,303
Oh, that's so nice of you.

220
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:12,472
Extremely nice,
but I think the issue here

221
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:14,974
is that we rented the cabin
at the same time.

222
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:16,960
Correct that does seem to be
what happened.

223
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:18,644
Yeah. Watch out for the mud.

224
00:12:18,797 --> 00:12:21,297
We haven't had any snow yet
this winter,

225
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,741
but we've had plenty of rain.

226
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:24,409
[Door opens]

227
00:12:26,638 --> 00:12:27,746
Wait.

228
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,497
We are so sorry about
this whole thing.

229
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,832
I'm Fran, by the way.

230
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:41,426
- This is my husband Robert,
- Gaby: Hello.

231
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:44,988
Who is the one most at fault
for this mix-up.

232
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,931
- Gaby.
- See, look,

233
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,342
this is the first year
that we've rented the cabin

234
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,160
using an online website.

235
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:52,771
I don't know if you know this,

236
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:54,514
but sometimes those things
can be really confusing.

237
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,350
I thought Robert had it handled,
but clearly...

238
00:12:57,502 --> 00:13:00,853
You know, these mistakes
can easily happen.

239
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:04,507
Um, my only concern
is what happens now?

240
00:13:04,526 --> 00:13:08,361
I think we should just go with
who reserved the cabin first.

241
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:10,437
I know I made the reservation
months ago.

242
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:13,533
Now, unfortunately, there really
isn't any record of that.

243
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,461
I didn't know if you liked
the low-fat yogurt,

244
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:18,704
- so I went with the regular.
- Oh.

245
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,965
[Sniffs]

246
00:13:21,117 --> 00:13:22,708
- Oh!
- Mm-hmm.

247
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:25,136
This hot chocolate looks good.

248
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:26,712
Please, help yourself.

249
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:28,956
Robert: You know, the bathroom,

250
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,810
well, there's really only enough
hot water for one person.

251
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,538
So what you're saying is

252
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:38,966
really just one person
should be staying here.

253
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,969
Or you could both stay here.

254
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,896
- The couch is very comfortable.
- Yes, yes.

255
00:13:44,049 --> 00:13:45,898
- Oh, no, I don't think so.
- No, mm-mm.

256
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,718
Look, I know some people
who work at the inn.

257
00:13:48,736 --> 00:13:50,553
I'll ask around tomorrow.

258
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:53,890
But the town is pretty full.

259
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:57,001
Can you two make it one night?
It will be fun.

260
00:13:57,228 --> 00:13:59,228
- You can make a new friend.
- Yeah.

261
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:00,321
[Fran chuckles]

262
00:14:00,415 --> 00:14:01,989
You know, I checked,

263
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,343
and there isn't any availability
within a 20-mile radius.

264
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,919
I don't really think
we have a choice.

265
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:08,571
Well, then it's settled.

266
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:10,756
Yeah, you guys both stay here,

267
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:12,925
and if something
opens up, great.

268
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,761
And if not, we'll...
We'll give you a discount.

269
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:17,430
And...

270
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:19,840
No more computers for us.

271
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,342
[Laughs]

272
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:24,011
- Well, we'll leave you to it.
- Yeah.

273
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,363
Okay.

274
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,036
Yeah.

275
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,039
Both: Dibs on the bed.

276
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:38,877
Gaby: Heads.

277
00:14:40,772 --> 00:14:42,105
What?

278
00:14:42,123 --> 00:14:45,108
- Best out of three.
- No. No, no, no.

279
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:47,385
That couch looks great though.

280
00:14:47,536 --> 00:14:50,037
Fine, fine.

281
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:51,723
Oh, I call the basement though.

282
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:54,375
You'd rather sleep
in the basement?

283
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:57,120
No. No, it's for
a makeshift darkroom.

284
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:59,622
I'll just clear
some of the boxes out of there.

285
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:00,973
Wait, you shooting on film?

286
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,309
Oh, I always shoot on film
whenever possible.

287
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,738
I thought you said you're
a professional photographer.

288
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:08,131
I am.

289
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:09,908
Are you also
a time traveler from 1985?

290
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:11,467
Okay, take it easy.

291
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:14,728
It's the most authentic version
of our art form.

292
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,822
Yeah, but there's a reason
our art form

293
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,399
transitioned to digital.

294
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,159
Well, not everyone sees it
that way.

295
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:24,422
It's why we went from web plates
to Kodachrome to instamatics

296
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:26,925
to ektar and now
to digital sensors, right?

297
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:29,168
'Cause the the point
of photography

298
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,411
is quality and speed.

299
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:31,930
Are you kidding me?

300
00:15:32,157 --> 00:15:35,749
Film provides a way higher
dynamic range.

301
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:37,418
I get more accurate skin tones,

302
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,846
not to mention I pick up
way more details

303
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:42,682
that are missed
on digital photography.

304
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:45,259
I can take an infinite
amount of pictures

305
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:46,927
on a lighter-weight camera.

306
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:50,173
Well, I have to put more thought
and purpose into my shots

307
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:52,450
because they actually matter.

308
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:54,619
I can edit
directly on my camera.

309
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,622
I have complete control with my
chemical process in my darkroom.

310
00:15:57,773 --> 00:15:59,457
I have modern lenses.

311
00:15:59,608 --> 00:16:01,942
I don't have to rely on
a digital representation

312
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:03,703
of my environment.

313
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:06,372
A digital representation
of your environment?

314
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,692
Art is supposed to
connect you to your senses.

315
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:12,786
Oh, okay, I don't even know why
I'm having this debate with you

316
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,474
because clearly digital is what
makes sense in this day and age.

317
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,201
Agree to disagree.

318
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:20,812
Okay, I'm going to bed.

319
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,464
Well, you enjoy
that giant cozy bed.

320
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,483
Enjoy that couch.

321
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:27,043
- I will.
- Good.

322
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:29,988
And I've endured way worse,
by the way.

323
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:32,139
You know, one time I had
to sleep on a rock ledge

324
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,900
just to get the perfect shot
of a mountain goat, so...

325
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,661
Of course you did.

326
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:41,332
Mm-hmm.
[Humming merrily]

327
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:43,001
Oh, it's cute up here!

328
00:16:45,897 --> 00:16:49,507
[Sean humming "jingle bells"]

329
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:51,509
[Humming continues]

330
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,572
[Clattering]

331
00:16:56,591 --> 00:16:58,257
[Drawer closes]

332
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:02,520
[Clattering continues]

333
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:07,859
[Humming continues]

334
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:13,197
[Humming continues]

335
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:21,355
What are you doing?

336
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,541
Oh, good morning!
Did you sleep well?

337
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:26,544
I didn't wake you, did I?

338
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:29,380
Actually, you kinda did.

339
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:31,774
What is all this?

340
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:33,109
I was cleaning out the basement,

341
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:35,127
you know, for my dark room,

342
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,371
and I found all these
Christmas decorations.

343
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,799
And you just decided
to help yourself.

344
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,894
Mm-hmm. I figured
we're at a Christmas retreat,

345
00:17:43,045 --> 00:17:45,137
maybe it'll help put us
in the right mindset.

346
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,715
Hmm. That explains the outfit.

347
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:52,403
Aha, so you noticed
my Santa Claus print pajamas.

348
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:54,797
Super cozy.

349
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,650
Is that a child's
extra-extra-extra large?

350
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,151
For your information,

351
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,579
they make Christmas pajamas
in adult sizes.

352
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,247
And you might wanna
look into it

353
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:08,419
because for someone in fashion,
your robe is kinda blah.

354
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,424
I need coffee.

355
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:24,936
Oh, come on, you sure you don't
wanna help decorate, hmm?

356
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:26,437
[Chuckles]

357
00:18:26,664 --> 00:18:30,424
Um, I'm not a super big fan
of Christmas.

358
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,685
You do realize we're about
to meet a bunch of people

359
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,354
who are here for
a Christmas photography retreat.

360
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:37,448
Key word here being
"Christmas."

361
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:41,935
Yeah, well,
um, if you must know,

362
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,622
I actually signed up
because I'm trying to get a job

363
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:47,683
as a staff photographer
at<i> style source magazine.</i>

364
00:18:47,702 --> 00:18:49,869
So, wait, you're not
just here for fun?

365
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:51,612
No.

366
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:55,282
And being awoken by a stranger
I'm cohabitating with

367
00:18:55,376 --> 00:18:56,968
in a cabin I rented

368
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,696
because he feels the need
to decorate at 7 A.M.

369
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:02,789
Is not exactly
my idea of fun.

370
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:04,717
Okay, fair enough.

371
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,218
Why are you here?

372
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,646
I mean, are you just
doing this for fun?

373
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:10,964
Of course.
I love photography.

374
00:19:11,058 --> 00:19:12,875
I love Christmas.

375
00:19:12,894 --> 00:19:14,819
You know, I finally got
some free time,

376
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,970
and before I head to my sisters
for the holidays,

377
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,823
this retreat
was a gift to myself.

378
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,399
Oh.

379
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:22,660
All right, I get it.

380
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:24,495
You're super big
into Christmas.

381
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:26,164
Look at me.

382
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,501
Uh, well,
I'm gonna get dressed.

383
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:36,174
I, uh, I don't wanna be late
for our first day.

384
00:19:57,605 --> 00:20:00,923
Gaby, we should leave now!

385
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:03,517
I know.
I'll be right there.

386
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,852
Sort of blah.

387
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,371
What does he know?

388
00:20:12,787 --> 00:20:13,711
Coming!

389
00:20:29,303 --> 00:20:30,895
[Bell rings]

390
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:34,732
Oh, donuts! You want one?

391
00:20:34,883 --> 00:20:36,901
Uh, no, thanks.
I don't eat breakfast.

392
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,074
Gaby?

393
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,393
Dani? Hi! Oh, my gosh!

394
00:20:46,487 --> 00:20:48,395
It's been way too long.

395
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,974
I know! I-I can't believe
you're here.

396
00:20:51,993 --> 00:20:54,418
Same. Um, are you doing
the retreat?

397
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:56,069
I am.

398
00:20:56,163 --> 00:20:57,496
- Really.
- Yeah.

399
00:20:57,648 --> 00:20:58,756
I didn't think
it was your thing.

400
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,591
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

401
00:21:00,818 --> 00:21:01,759
Gaby, this is
my girlfriend, Amelia.

402
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,594
Amelia, this is Gaby.

403
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:05,838
We went to nyu together.
Photography majors.

404
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,323
Oh, that's so cool.

405
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,249
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

406
00:21:09,343 --> 00:21:11,435
Is that your person?

407
00:21:11,662 --> 00:21:15,014
No, no, not at all.
I met him yesterday

408
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:17,108
when it turned out
my rental was double-booked.

409
00:21:18,594 --> 00:21:22,429
My name is Sean.
So nice to meet you both.

410
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,448
Uh, you two wouldn't
happen to know

411
00:21:24,675 --> 00:21:26,266
of a spare hotel room
in town, would you?

412
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,934
I'm sorry. We drove.

413
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,288
Last year, we converted
a school bus into a tiny home.

414
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:32,272
Yeah, we drive around
the country now,

415
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,867
taking photographs
for our postcard website.

416
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,794
Wow, that's adventurous.

417
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:38,779
It's a far cry
from our model shoot days

418
00:21:38,873 --> 00:21:40,205
when we interned together.

419
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,043
Yeah, um, that...
That wasn't my scene, you know?

420
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:45,636
Are you still in
the fashion world?

421
00:21:45,788 --> 00:21:47,196
Very much so.

422
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:49,365
It's all I've done
since we graduated.

423
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:51,700
I'm trying to get staffed
at<i> style source magazine.</i>

424
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:53,202
Oh, I love that magazine.

425
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,537
Me too.

426
00:21:54,555 --> 00:21:56,463
Welcome! Welcome!

427
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,224
Please, everyone grab
another donut, some more coffee

428
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,634
and take a seat.

429
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,636
It's time to get
this retreat started!

430
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,046
Yeah!

431
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:05,898
- It's so good to see you.
- You too.

432
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,825
- Do you wanna sit with us?
- We'd love to.

433
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:20,563
My name is bill Peters.

434
00:22:20,581 --> 00:22:23,415
Some of you might know my work.

435
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:26,326
I was pretty busy in
the New York photography scene

436
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,179
for most of my life.

437
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:30,497
Worked for the<i> times,</i>
the<i> journal,</i>

438
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:34,076
traveling all over, covering
almost anything and everything

439
00:22:34,095 --> 00:22:37,930
and missing
every single Christmas.

440
00:22:38,082 --> 00:22:40,691
Finally, one day it hit me.

441
00:22:40,918 --> 00:22:42,935
Taking pictures
wasn't fun anymore.

442
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:46,847
I lost my passion,
and that broke my heart.

443
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,533
So I quit and moved out here.

444
00:22:49,685 --> 00:22:53,429
I opened this gallery,

445
00:22:53,522 --> 00:22:55,206
so I could help
people like you

446
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:58,042
reconnect with
the magic of photography

447
00:22:58,193 --> 00:23:00,711
through the beauty of Christmas
in pine falls.

448
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:07,443
Each day, I'll give you
a Christmas assignment,

449
00:23:07,461 --> 00:23:09,035
some specific, some general,

450
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:12,448
and I'll be here for guidance,
tips and questions,

451
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,800
but I want you to go out there

452
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,377
and explore what Christmas
really means to you.

453
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:20,547
Every night, I want you to look
over your photos from the day

454
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,474
and pick your favorites
to submit.

455
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:27,220
On the last day of the retreat
is our big showcase

456
00:23:27,314 --> 00:23:28,964
right here in the studio,

457
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:31,800
where we can all
comment, critique

458
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:33,744
and appreciate
each other's work.

459
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:37,415
Sounds like it's designed around
shooting digital.

460
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:40,567
- Uh, question.
- Yes.

461
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:42,995
There are no rules for what
we have to shoot on, right?

462
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:46,257
Personally, I feel as though
film is the best medium

463
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:47,591
for Christmas photography.

464
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:50,428
Go for it!
Film, digital, pin boxes,

465
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:53,431
whatever you feel
best captures Christmas.

466
00:23:53,658 --> 00:23:56,008
Oh, and I've learned
over the years

467
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,936
that it's best to split up
into smaller groups

468
00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:01,105
as you go out
on each assignment.

469
00:24:01,256 --> 00:24:05,425
The chairs are arranged in rows
for a reason.

470
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,836
Where you are sitting
is your group

471
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:09,338
for the rest of the retreat.

472
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:11,932
Nice! We're gonna be together.

473
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:13,342
Would you look at that.

474
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:15,119
Good thing I sat down
next to you guys.

475
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,862
That's great.

476
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,790
We're kicking things off today
with the assignment

477
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:21,700
"Christmas in nature."

478
00:24:21,852 --> 00:24:24,128
Christmas in nature.

479
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,463
What is that?

480
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,705
Shh.

481
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:28,281
Bill: Some lighting tips
and tricks

482
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,633
for shooting outside.

483
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,713
It's so good to see you.

484
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:37,457
This whole thing
is not my forte.

485
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:40,369
I really just want to show Leila
that I've got what it takes.

486
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:42,721
Leila was our teacher at nyu,

487
00:24:42,873 --> 00:24:45,131
and she's the photo editor
at<i> style source.</i>

488
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,558
With her recommendation,

489
00:24:46,711 --> 00:24:48,877
I'd be a real shoo-in
for that staff job.

490
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,987
Hmm.

491
00:24:50,138 --> 00:24:54,325
All right,
one peppermint mocha,

492
00:24:54,552 --> 00:24:58,311
one Santa's
vanilla spiced latte,

493
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,906
one Christmas caramel
macchiato...

494
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,907
Thank you.

495
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,317
And a regular coffee,

496
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:06,003
nothing else in it.

497
00:25:06,154 --> 00:25:07,579
I don't know how
you drink it like that.

498
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,232
It's way bitter.

499
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:12,176
I just don't like
all the floof.

500
00:25:12,327 --> 00:25:14,086
That's the best part!

501
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,496
Agreed! She has no idea
what she's missing out on.

502
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:19,499
I don't like toppings
on my pizza either.

503
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,668
Who hurt you?

504
00:25:21,762 --> 00:25:25,523
Okay, let me know if you guys
need anything else, all right?

505
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,691
I like him.

506
00:25:27,918 --> 00:25:29,193
So...

507
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,437
Let's get started.

508
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:36,182
Um, Christmas in nature.
Any ideas?

509
00:25:36,277 --> 00:25:39,778
Well, we could see if there's
some pear trees around,

510
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,373
throw a couple partridges
in there, and boom!

511
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,359
You got yourself
Christmas in nature.

512
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:48,120
How about you, Gaby?

513
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,940
What's your favorite thing
to do outside during Christmas?

514
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:54,943
Go inside and get warm.

515
00:25:55,037 --> 00:25:56,720
Gaby doesn't like Christmas.

516
00:25:56,947 --> 00:25:59,873
I didn't say I didn't like
Christmas, okay?

517
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,893
I said I'm not
a Christmas person.

518
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,729
Well, that's funny
because you got mad at me

519
00:26:05,956 --> 00:26:09,233
for decorating our cabin
for Christmas.

520
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,235
First of all,
it's not our cabin,

521
00:26:11,386 --> 00:26:14,963
and secondly,
he started decorating at 7 A.M.

522
00:26:14,982 --> 00:26:16,481
While I was still sleeping.

523
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:18,817
Okay, well, excuse me
for being a morning guy.

524
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:22,471
What if we just hike around
and see what we find?

525
00:26:22,489 --> 00:26:27,567

Just in case you need it.

702
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,483
Today's assignment is
"Christmas past."

703
00:36:10,577 --> 00:36:13,319
One of the reasons why
I fell in love with pine falls

704
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:17,156
was its history of making
Christmas a town priority.

705
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,176
In fact, in 1870,

706
00:36:19,403 --> 00:36:22,345
Charles Shepard,
the mayor of pine falls,

707
00:36:22,572 --> 00:36:24,756
wrote into law that
the entire month of December

708
00:36:24,908 --> 00:36:27,017
was to be made a town holiday.

709
00:36:27,168 --> 00:36:31,855
No school, no work,
only Christmas celebration.

710
00:36:32,082 --> 00:36:36,584
In fact, the Shepard house
is now a museum.

711
00:36:36,603 --> 00:36:41,256
Every December, they decorate it
exactly the way it used to be.

712
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:44,951
I highly recommend stopping by
as you explore the town today.

713
00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:50,189
This is impressive.

714
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,267
It feels like
we went through a time warp.

715
00:36:52,285 --> 00:36:55,194
Now, this is Christmas.

716
00:36:55,288 --> 00:36:57,439
Is that Robert?

717
00:36:57,457 --> 00:36:59,290
Hey, folks!

718
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,701
Robert! Looking good!

719
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,886
[Laughs]

720
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:04,963
- You work here too?
- Volunteer.

721
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,948
Yes, I'm a descendant
of Charles Shepard.

722
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:09,117
Oh.

723
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,727
Hey, you guys wanna
go for a ride?

724
00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:12,062
Ooh!

725
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:16,124
Um, Dani and Amelia
should go first.

726
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:18,217
- How about it?
- Sounds lovely.

727
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:19,736
Perfect. Follow me.

728
00:37:21,982 --> 00:37:25,158
[Chuckles]
Those two.

729
00:37:27,304 --> 00:37:29,821
Okay, let's start clicking.

730
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,414
Oh, yeah.

731
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,483
[Sean chuckles]

732
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:42,817
[Gasps]

733
00:37:42,836 --> 00:37:44,761
Look at these decorations.

734
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:46,821
They're so fragile.

735
00:37:46,914 --> 00:37:49,991
Says they were made in 1848.

736
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:52,010
Wow.

737
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:55,772
So, um, what was the deal
with the carriage?

738
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:57,774
Well, I'm not supposed
to say anything,

739
00:37:57,925 --> 00:38:01,444
but I think I know what's gonna
happen on that carriage ride.

740
00:38:01,596 --> 00:38:04,689
Same. How do you know?

741
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,524
Well, don't tell Dani,

742
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:11,937
but Amelia is planning
to propose on this trip.

743
00:38:12,032 --> 00:38:16,200
No, Dani is planning to propose
to Amelia on this trip.

744
00:38:16,353 --> 00:38:19,020
Oh, that's so sweet.

745
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:21,280
I wonder who's gonna
do it first?

746
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,191
Gaby: Oh, hello.

747
00:38:23,209 --> 00:38:25,527
Well, I think Dani's
overthinking it, you know?

748
00:38:25,545 --> 00:38:27,637
She just wants everything
to be so perfect.

749
00:38:27,789 --> 00:38:30,790
Ah, someone who wants
everything to be perfect.

750
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:33,718
I wonder why
that sounds familiar.

751
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:35,386
What?

752
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:37,647
You with your pictures.

753
00:38:37,874 --> 00:38:40,650
Right, but I work for
a magazine, you know?

754
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:43,135
Things, they have
to be perfect.

755
00:38:43,229 --> 00:38:46,230
When you take pictures for
yourself, that doesn't matter.

756
00:38:46,383 --> 00:38:48,158
Perfection doesn't even exist.

757
00:38:56,651 --> 00:39:01,153
Look at how the candlelight
is shining off of the garland.

758
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,914
Very nicely done.

759
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:06,084
- I wasn't even going for that.
- You see?

760
00:39:06,236 --> 00:39:08,094
That's the best part.

761
00:39:09,497 --> 00:39:11,514
So let me see some of yours.

762
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:12,924
Oh, I have...

763
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,000
That's right, I can't.

764
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,170
Hey, guys,
you have to go on a ride.

765
00:39:18,264 --> 00:39:19,764
The views are great!

766
00:39:19,916 --> 00:39:21,082
Huh.

767
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:23,008
- And?
- How'd it go?

768
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:25,195
Well, head's up.
Robert's a bit chatty.

769
00:39:25,422 --> 00:39:27,364
Yeah, I couldn't even
get a word in.

770
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:29,607
Gaby, Sean?

771
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,275
Your turn.

772
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,927
Was it worth it?

773
00:39:32,946 --> 00:39:34,596
Yes. The ride's beautiful.

774
00:39:34,614 --> 00:39:35,538
Oh.

775
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,208
Have fun.

776
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:42,379
They're so cute.

[Cameras clicking]

778
00:39:51,448 --> 00:39:53,556
It wasn't till
after the civil war

779
00:39:53,783 --> 00:39:56,059
that Charles Shepard
even came out this far west.

780
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,894
[Horse whinnies]

781
00:39:58,121 --> 00:39:59,879
It was love at first sight
though.

782
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,233
He moved his wife and kids out
and built that house.

783
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:06,461
Hey, Robert, you know, it's
kinda hard to hear back here,

784
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:08,796
what with the the wind
and the horses.

785
00:40:08,815 --> 00:40:10,723
Oh, of course, of course.

786
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:13,392
Just enjoy the ride!

787
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:14,411
[Horse whinnies]

788
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,473
How about you?

789
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:21,567
Anyone planning to
propose to you anytime soon?

790
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,736
Are you asking me
if I'm single?

791
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:27,757
Uh, no, I'm just...
Just making conversation.

792
00:40:29,653 --> 00:40:31,911
Well...

793
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,322
No, actually.

794
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,841
The last few years have been
about trying to get hired

795
00:40:36,993 --> 00:40:38,601
as a staff photographer.

796
00:40:38,753 --> 00:40:40,770
All work and no play.
Got it.

797
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,666
What about you?

798
00:40:44,684 --> 00:40:46,776
Gaby, are you asking me
if I am single?

799
00:40:47,003 --> 00:40:49,112
Oh, my gosh.

800
00:40:52,008 --> 00:40:54,025
Ah, I travel too much.

801
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,787
Never in one place long enough
to make something last.

802
00:41:01,201 --> 00:41:03,376
Well, I guess
we're married to these.

803
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:09,382
I think we just found something
we have in common.

804

[Whinnies]

- No.

Hey, Sean, can I get your
thoughts on some of these?

808
00:41:27,544 --> 00:41:30,153
Of course.
I'll just... okay.

809
00:41:32,215 --> 00:41:33,156

810
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:35,733
Come here.

811
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,243
Oh, yeah.

812
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,739
Yeah?

813
00:41:41,891 --> 00:41:43,725
So? What's the story?

814
00:41:43,818 --> 00:41:45,985
Um, the carriage
had amazing views.

815
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,670
No, come on. You and Sean.

816
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,342
There is no story.
I barely know him.

817
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:57,405
Okay, so being stuck in a cabin
with a sweet, single, hot guy

818
00:41:57,498 --> 00:41:58,923
hasn't caused any thoughts?

819

I don't know.
I'm not thinking about all that.

820

I mean, I'm here to show
that I have depth.

821
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:07,915
Okay, yeah, I'll drop it.

822
00:42:07,934 --> 00:42:10,527
What about you?

823
00:42:10,678 --> 00:42:13,421
You haven't proposed at the lake
during the sunset

00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:15,273
or now at the carriage drive?

825

Yeah, uh, it just hasn't been
the right moment.

00:42:18,778 --> 00:42:20,703
Just...

827
00:42:20,855 --> 00:42:23,039
Don't overthink it.

I took of Sean?

- Yeah.
- It came out pretty good.

I didn't overthink.

of architecture like that

all of the energy

I was little, I really did.

and, you know,

906
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,336
Christmas became a battle.

907
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,338
Which house would I be at
on Christmas morning?

908
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,433

inevitably disappoint?

for the best present?

double the guilt

917
00:46:34,608 --> 00:46:35,792
and double the expectations.

918
00:46:38,204 --> 00:46:41,214
Well, makes sense why you're not
the biggest fan of the holiday.

00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:37,028
without looking through
the viewfinder.

1054
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:38,605
But look at how you captured
the fur texture.

1055
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:42,718
I mean, the tone,
only film could do that.

1056
00:53:42,945 --> 00:53:46,705
There is a sentimentality to it,
isn't there?

1057
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:49,850
Not even one of your filters
could've pulled that off.

1058
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,519
Thank you.

1059
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,856
For making me do this.

1060
00:53:57,977 --> 00:54:00,903
You know, always happy
to spread the gospel of film.

1061
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,407
[Phone chimes]

1062
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:09,394
Oh, it's Dani.

1063
00:54:09,488 --> 00:54:12,306
"Couldn't find
a good spot to do it.

1064
00:54:12,399 --> 00:54:14,399
Amelia seemed distracted
all day too.

1065
00:54:14,493 --> 00:54:16,310
Not the right time, maybe."

1066
00:54:16,403 --> 00:54:18,328
If only they knew
the other one's thinking

1067
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,422
the exact same thing.

1068
00:54:35,831 --> 00:54:37,439
Smells good.

1069
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:39,775
You want me
to make you some eggs?

1070
00:54:40,002 --> 00:54:42,185
You're gonna make me
say it again, aren't you?

1071
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,171
I don't eat breakfast.

1072
00:54:44,264 --> 00:54:47,449
Which I still take
personal offense to.

1073
00:54:47,601 --> 00:54:49,510
But every Christmas Eve,
my sister and I

1074
00:54:49,603 --> 00:54:52,029
make the biggest breakfast
spread known to man.

1075
00:54:52,181 --> 00:54:56,517
I'm talking eggs, bacon,
pancakes, waffles.

1076
00:54:56,535 --> 00:54:58,443
Well, today's the 22nd.

1077
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,187
What happened
to your usual donut?

1078
00:55:00,205 --> 00:55:02,947
- We got the day off, remember?
- Yeah.

1079
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:04,633
Our last assignment is
"Christmas lights,"

1080
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,468
so everyone is meeting
in the town square,

1081
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:08,119
so we can
see everything lit up.

1082
00:55:08,213 --> 00:55:10,030
Okay. That'll give me time

1083
00:55:10,123 --> 00:55:11,807
to develop some more
of my photos.

1084
00:55:12,034 --> 00:55:14,368
Well, lucky for me,
everything I shot yesterday

1085
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:17,479
is already uploaded
and ready to go.

1086
00:55:17,631 --> 00:55:21,058
Oh, is your mind opening up
to the perks of digital?

1087
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:24,320
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

1088
00:55:24,547 --> 00:55:29,733
But, yes, I can't tell you
how nice it was to see

1089
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:32,310
everything that I shot right
there in the blink of an eye.

1090
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:35,405
Mm-mmm. Not bad.

1091
00:55:35,558 --> 00:55:37,666
Can I make you a plate?

1092
00:55:37,893 --> 00:55:39,335
No.

1093
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,839
No, no, no, I'm good.

1094
00:55:54,927 --> 00:55:57,686
This is the one
you should send to Leila.

1095
00:55:59,506 --> 00:56:00,856
Good idea.

1096
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,252
So with all of your traveling,

1097
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,696
do you always bring your
developing equipment with you?

1098
00:56:07,848 --> 00:56:12,350
Yep. I've turned some
pretty interesting places

1099
00:56:12,444 --> 00:56:13,927
into makeshift darkrooms.

1100
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,872
The cave in Peru
would probably be the craziest.

1101
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:20,601
And you don't have
a home base.

1102
00:56:20,694 --> 00:56:22,878
My sister's got
a guesthouse that I use.

1103
00:56:23,029 --> 00:56:24,880
Isn't that hard,

1104
00:56:25,107 --> 00:56:28,366
like not having a place
to call your own?

1105
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,294
It's just easier that way.

1106
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:33,463
What do you mean?

1107
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,966
Look, when you...

1108
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,136
When you plant roots somewhere,
you connect to people,

1109
00:56:39,288 --> 00:56:42,789
and sometimes
those connections don't last.

1110
00:56:42,808 --> 00:56:45,317
That can be hard.

1111
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:50,239
Yeah, yeah,
I guess you're right.

1112
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:53,650
My father left us
when I was four.

1113
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:58,989
Just up and left one day.
He was done with it all.

1114
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:02,567
You know, I think that's why
part of me feels like

1115
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:07,739
if I just keep moving,
you know,

1116
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:09,758
I can't ever be left again.

1117
00:57:14,748 --> 00:57:16,598
I'm sorry
that happened to you.

1118
00:57:19,995 --> 00:57:21,995
That's okay.

1119
00:57:22,014 --> 00:57:24,181
The only good thing is
my mom made sure

1120
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:29,019
that every single Christmas
was the best time of the year,

1121
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:31,280
extra special after he left.

1122
00:57:31,431 --> 00:57:34,783
I think that's why it brings me
so much joy, so much comfort.

1123
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,679
It's also why it's so important
to my sister and I

1124
00:57:38,772 --> 00:57:41,014
that we...

1125
00:57:41,107 --> 00:57:42,458
That we continue
our traditions.

1126
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,703
Now you get to share
your love of Christmas

1127
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,214
with grinches like me.

1128
00:57:52,027 --> 00:57:53,886
You said it, not me.

1129
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:05,872
Whoo!

1130
00:58:05,966 --> 00:58:08,208
Thank you all for coming out.

1131
00:58:08,301 --> 00:58:10,377
I know it's very chilly tonight,

1132
00:58:10,395 --> 00:58:12,654
and a storm
is supposed to roll in,

1133
00:58:12,806 --> 00:58:14,990
but I promise
tonight will be worth it.

1134
00:58:15,217 --> 00:58:17,826
Always like to do a shoot
where we're all together,

1135
00:58:17,978 --> 00:58:20,387
focused on
the same subject matter.

1136
00:58:20,405 --> 00:58:21,997
Tonight it is photographing

1137
00:58:22,224 --> 00:58:24,500
the amazing Christmas lights
in pine falls.

1138
00:58:24,727 --> 00:58:28,562
Before you all fan out,
I want to encourage you

1139
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:31,248
to experiment with
your exposure triangle

1140
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,826
to bring energy to your photos.

1141
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:39,848
Look for ways to tell a story
using your environment.

1142
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,518
Go! Play! Capture!

1143
00:58:55,424 --> 00:58:58,091
So no luck with
the proposal yesterday?

1144
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,701
How did you know?

1145
00:58:59,928 --> 00:59:01,537
Well, neither one of you
are wearing rings.

1146
00:59:01,764 --> 00:59:04,931
Yeah, I just couldn't find
the right moment.

1147
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:07,100
Every time, I was like,
"maybe this is the spot,"

1148
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,785
she just wanted to move on
to the next place.

1149
00:59:08,937 --> 00:59:11,863
I'm sure the right moment
will present itself soon.

1150
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,791
And... how was your day,

1151
00:59:14,943 --> 00:59:17,794
just the two of you
all alone in the cabin?

1152
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why did
your inflection just go up

1153
00:59:20,299 --> 00:59:21,706
at the end of that sentence?

1154
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,042
Oh, come on. Your whole...

1155
00:59:24,136 --> 00:59:26,953
"We don't like each other but
secretly we do" vibe? Please.

1156
00:59:26,972 --> 00:59:29,881
Actually...

1157
00:59:29,975 --> 00:59:32,142
We had a really good day.

1158
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:36,146
And Gaby is a lot of fun
to just hang out with.

1159
00:59:36,298 --> 00:59:37,297
Uh-huh.

1160
00:59:37,316 --> 00:59:38,632
Look, she lives in New York,

1161
00:59:38,725 --> 00:59:40,242
I live wherever
the magazine takes me,

1162
00:59:40,393 --> 00:59:42,302
and that's that.

1163
00:59:42,395 --> 00:59:44,304
So you thought about it then.

1164
00:59:44,397 --> 00:59:48,141
Perhaps.
You know, here and there.

1165
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,901
Only as much as anyone would

1166
00:59:49,995 --> 00:59:52,737
who enjoys spending time with
someone who's intelligent.

1167
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:53,922
Sure.

1168
00:59:54,074 --> 00:59:55,740
- Attractive.
- Yeah.

1169
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,168
- Charming.
- Right.

1170
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:01,004
But that's it. It's just
a fleeting thought, okay?

1171
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,433
She's had this one-track mind
ever since she got here.

1172
01:00:04,584 --> 01:00:09,012
Well, tomorrow's
the last day, so...

1173
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:11,014
So that's it.

1174
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:14,092
Nothing's gonna happen.

1175
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,277
If you say so.

1176
01:00:20,175 --> 01:00:21,074
[Click]

1177
01:00:22,435 --> 01:00:25,621
I know she'll say yes though.

1178
01:00:25,772 --> 01:00:28,290
Got you this.

1179
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:30,792
I already know you're gonna say
it's too sugary.

1180
01:00:30,944 --> 01:00:32,035
I'll take it.

1181
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:34,204
It's hot.

1182
01:00:34,356 --> 01:00:37,190
That's kind of why
it's part of the name.

1183
01:00:37,209 --> 01:00:39,635
Does this mean you're gonna try
mine with the cocoa from Ghana?

1184
01:00:39,862 --> 01:00:43,805
Yeah, I'll try some
when we get home.

1185
01:00:46,051 --> 01:00:49,811
You know, I think we should
go that way

1186
01:00:49,963 --> 01:00:52,814
because we'll get
a great wide shot.

1187
01:00:52,966 --> 01:00:54,391
Uh, it's probably...

1188
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:55,484
You should come.

1189
01:00:57,546 --> 01:00:58,561
Come.

1190
01:00:58,714 --> 01:01:00,489
Uh, yeah, that's a great idea.

1191
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,491
- And I will join you.
- Oh, great.

1192
01:01:05,311 --> 01:01:06,995
- She would like this.
- Yeah.

1193
01:01:09,725 --> 01:01:13,151
Back there,
you called the cabin "home."

1194
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,411
I did?

1195
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:17,080
Yeah, and I liked it.

1196
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:21,009
Technically, it is our home
until at least tomorrow.

1197
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:25,681
What are you getting at?

1198
01:01:25,832 --> 01:01:28,758
I know it was a mistake
that we even crossed paths

1199
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:30,001
in the first place.

1200
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:33,355
I just, I wanted to say that...

1201
01:01:33,582 --> 01:01:35,357
Oh, my gosh.

1202
01:01:35,584 --> 01:01:37,767
I know.
There's something here and...

1203
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,861
Yeah, look at that!

1204
01:01:42,274 --> 01:01:44,366
Uh, okay, uh...

1205
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:47,035
Gaby: Wow.

1206
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,207
Sean: This...

1207
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:00,865
This is definitely making
my Christmas wonder folder.

1208
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:03,626
No picture can
do this place justice.

1209
01:02:03,779 --> 01:02:04,553
Oh, I agree.

1210
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,706
When I was little,

1211
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:11,727
I used to go through
my grandma's scrapbooks,

1212
01:02:11,878 --> 01:02:14,304
and I would have
this overwhelming feeling

1213
01:02:14,456 --> 01:02:17,899
of wanting to crawl inside them
and live there forever.

1214
01:02:20,887 --> 01:02:22,738
This place gives me
that feeling.

1215
01:02:22,889 --> 01:02:26,908
Yeah, I mean, there's Christmas
and then there's this.

1216
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:30,537
You know, this warmth
and magic...

1217
01:02:33,158 --> 01:02:35,809
Inexplicable beauty.

1218
01:02:35,827 --> 01:02:38,920
- This is it
- what is?

1219
01:02:39,072 --> 01:02:41,572
Where Dani should
propose to Amelia.

1220
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:45,076
Or Amelia to Dani.

1221
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:47,929
Yeah, it's perfect.

1222
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:17,292
So?

1223
01:03:17,443 --> 01:03:20,203
You're right.
This is really good.

1224
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:23,465
You see, it's how they
harvest the cocoa bean.

1225
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,527
I wonder how long
it's gonna snow like this.

1226
01:03:27,546 --> 01:03:29,529
You know, I have a flight out
tomorrow night.

1227
01:03:29,548 --> 01:03:31,622
Yeah, same.

1228
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:33,624
I really hope I can be
with my sister and her family

1229
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:35,051
for Christmas Eve.

1230
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:38,814
- How long are you staying for?
- A few days.

1231
01:03:38,965 --> 01:03:40,631
And then it's on
to your next adventure.

1232
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:42,818
You know how it is.
There's always some place to be

1233
01:03:43,045 --> 01:03:44,945
and something
to take a picture of.

1234
01:03:46,973 --> 01:03:50,717
Yeah, but there is nothing like
going home to your own apartment

1235
01:03:50,735 --> 01:03:52,143
after a long day.

1236
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,812
Don't you ever wish
you had a bed

1237
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:57,073
or just some of your own walls

1238
01:03:57,225 --> 01:03:59,909
where you could hang up
your favorite pictures?

1239
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:01,503
Sometimes.

1240
01:04:05,325 --> 01:04:07,342
Oh, look.
It's so beautiful.

1241
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:21,581
So all the roads are closed.

1242
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,600
And they're expecting
more snow tonight.

1243
01:04:23,694 --> 01:04:25,919
I've decided to move
the showcase to the 25th

1244
01:04:26,012 --> 01:04:28,088
<i> and make it</i>
<i> a Christmas celebration.</i>

1245
01:04:28,106 --> 01:04:30,699
I was supposed to be on
a flight out tonight.

1246
01:04:30,926 --> 01:04:32,775
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

1247
01:04:32,928 --> 01:04:34,944
If the roads don't reopen,
I'll be here too.

1248
01:04:35,097 --> 01:04:36,371
<i> I'll keep everyone updated.</i>

1249
01:04:36,598 --> 01:04:39,541
In the meantime,
stay safe and warm.

1250
01:04:39,692 --> 01:04:41,784
Thanks. You too.

1251
01:04:41,937 --> 01:04:43,795
So what do we do now?

1252
01:04:47,776 --> 01:04:51,202
Looks like we have ourselves
a snow day.

01:05:03,049 --> 01:05:06,126
I want you to give me

1257
01:05:06,219 --> 01:05:07,977

My weather app says there's
more snow in a few hours.

1263
01:05:23,478 --> 01:05:25,478
I already called my sister
and told her,

1264
01:05:25,497 --> 01:05:28,256
let her know I probably won't
make it until after Christmas.

1265
01:05:28,408 --> 01:05:29,424
I'm sorry.

1266
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,169
All things considered,

1267
01:05:33,321 --> 01:05:35,680
this isn't the worst place
to get stuck.

1268
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:39,325
And the company
isn't half-bad either.

1269
01:05:39,344 --> 01:05:40,518
Indeed.

1270
01:05:42,847 --> 01:05:44,013
- Sean...
- Gaby...

1271
01:05:44,166 --> 01:05:46,015

1272
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:47,183
Sorry, go ahead.

1273
01:05:47,335 --> 01:05:50,019
Um...

1274
01:05:50,172 --> 01:05:52,505
I just wanted to say...

1275
01:05:52,598 --> 01:05:54,449
I'm glad we're stuck together.

1276
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,954
What'd you wanna say?

1277
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,040
Exact same thing.

1278
01:06:10,542 --> 01:06:12,116
[Phone ringing]

1279
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,469
I'm so sorry.

1280
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,545
[Ringing continues]

1281
01:06:15,697 --> 01:06:17,547
- Um, let me...
- Yeah.

01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,140

1283
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:22,477
- It's Leila.
- Yeah.

1284
01:06:25,223 --> 01:06:26,372
Hi, Leila.

1285
01:06:26,391 --> 01:06:28,316
I have some exciting news.

1286
01:06:28,543 --> 01:06:30,819
An early Christmas gift,
if you will.

1287
01:06:31,046 --> 01:06:33,213
- Really?
<i> - I have been so impressed</i>

1288
01:06:33,306 --> 01:06:34,990
<i> with your progress lately</i>

1289
01:06:35,217 --> 01:06:38,809
<i> that today I spoke to Iris</i>

1292
01:06:43,725 --> 01:06:46,409
Oh, my gosh!

1293
01:06:46,561 --> 01:06:49,245
Thank you, thank you!

1294
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,231
<i> That's not even the best part.</i>
<i> Get this.</i>

1295
01:06:51,324 --> 01:06:53,824
She asked me to bring you to her
Christmas party as my plus-one.

1296
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:55,752
You are kidding.

1297
01:06:55,904 --> 01:06:57,679
I would not joke about
something like this.

1298
01:07:01,259 --> 01:07:06,913
<i> Um, well, that's the day</i>
<i> after tomorrow, right?</i>

1299
01:07:06,931 --> 01:07:09,858
<i> I'm stuck in pine falls.</i>

1300
01:07:10,009 --> 01:07:12,176
What do you mean?
I thought you fly back tonight.

1301
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:16,105
Yeah, there was a snowstorm,
the roads are closed,

1302
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:18,591
and they're also saying
it's gonna snow tonight.

1303
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,035
Oh, no.

1304
01:07:20,262 --> 01:07:23,279
<i> Well, um, what time is</i>
<i> Iris' Christmas party?</i>

1305
01:07:23,431 --> 01:07:25,281
7 P.M.

1306
01:07:25,433 --> 01:07:29,693
And do you think it would hurt
my chances if I didn't come?

1307
01:07:29,788 --> 01:07:31,938
<i> Yes! Yes, unfortunately, I do.</i>

1308
01:07:32,031 --> 01:07:34,865
<i> But I talked you up</i>
<i> so much today,</i>

1309
01:07:34,885 --> 01:07:37,777
<i> and Iris is eager to see</i>
<i> if you vibe</i>

1310
01:07:37,796 --> 01:07:39,870
<i> with the inner circle</i>
<i> that's gonna be there.</i>

1311
01:07:39,964 --> 01:07:42,390
<i> Those were her words.</i>

1312
01:07:42,542 --> 01:07:46,210
Um, okay,
well, you know, um...

1313
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,563
Maybe it won't snow tomorrow,

1314
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:51,566
and I'll be able
to get on a redeye?

1315
01:07:51,717 --> 01:07:54,977
Do whatever you can.
This is big.

1316
01:07:55,072 --> 01:07:56,629
I will.

1317
01:07:56,722 --> 01:07:58,490
<i> All right. Keep me posted.</i>

1318
01:07:59,651 --> 01:08:01,968
Did you hear that?

1319
01:08:01,986 --> 01:08:03,912
Uh, yeah.

1320
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:08,157
Iris Holmes wants to meet me.

1321
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:10,734
You know, I hate to say it,

1322
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:13,496
but the chances of you
getting out of here by then,

1323
01:08:13,648 --> 01:08:15,256
they don't look so good.

1324
01:08:15,408 --> 01:08:20,428
Well, I mean, maybe it won't
snow as much tonight, right?

1325
01:08:20,655 --> 01:08:23,598
Or maybe they'll
plow the roads early.

1326
01:08:23,825 --> 01:08:25,767
Yeah, maybe.

1327
01:08:28,087 --> 01:08:29,104
Hey, look, either way,

1328
01:08:29,255 --> 01:08:31,180
tomorrow morning
is Christmas Eve,

1329
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:34,517
and since we'll be stuck
together until further notice,

1330
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:36,277
we're gonna celebrate.

1331
01:08:36,429 --> 01:08:37,928
- Just us?
- Yeah.

1332
01:08:38,022 --> 01:08:40,523
It'll keep you from
obsessing over road conditions.

1333
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:43,618
You're right.
It's out of our hands anyway.

1334
01:08:43,845 --> 01:08:45,603
We might as well
make the best of it.

1335
01:08:45,697 --> 01:08:47,271
Now, see, that's the spirit.

1336
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:51,200
Listen, um, tonight,
if you want the bed, it's yours.

1337
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,852
Don't be silly.

1338
01:08:52,945 --> 01:08:54,445
I'm starting to get
used to the couch.

1339
01:08:54,539 --> 01:08:56,189
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1340
01:08:56,282 --> 01:08:58,282
Besides someone has
to wake up early

1341
01:08:58,376 --> 01:09:01,043
to make you the best breakfast
spread you've ever seen.

1342
01:09:01,138 --> 01:09:04,714
- I don't eat...
- Oh, you will on Christmas Eve.

1343
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:06,307
I promise.

1344
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:17,968
Nonstop snow last night.
The roads are still closed.

1345
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:19,970
Looks like I'm gonna have
to start accepting the fact

1346
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:22,048
that I'm gonna miss this party.

1347
01:09:22,066 --> 01:09:23,158
[Gasps]

1348
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,406
Merry Christmas Eve.

01:09:30,558 --> 01:09:34,227
Wow. You weren't joking.

1350
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,504
And everything is red and green.

1351
01:09:36,731 --> 01:09:37,988
Yeah, just like mom
used to make it.

1352
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:41,825
Bacon or sausage,
pancakes or waffles.

1353
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,069
Red or green eggs.

1354
01:09:43,162 --> 01:09:45,405
Or you could just have it all.

1355
01:09:45,423 --> 01:09:47,590
It does smell really good.

1356
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:52,336
Oh, by the way,
have you seen the dishtowel?

1357
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:53,671
Oh, yeah, I set...

1358
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,523
[Gasps]
Oh!

1359
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:57,600
Yeah, I thought I'd try it
just for you.

1360
01:09:57,752 --> 01:10:01,512
Now since neither one of us
is going anywhere anytime soon,

1361
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,531
I thought that we'd
just enjoy today.

1362
01:10:03,683 --> 01:10:05,091

Okay, so the key
to making reindeer food

1373
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:40,235
is to spread it all out evenly.

1374
01:10:40,386 --> 01:10:42,070
Mm-hmm, yes.

1375
01:10:42,221 --> 01:10:46,741
So reindeer food is really
rice krispie treats.

1376
01:10:46,892 --> 01:10:49,560
What? No, not at all.

1377
01:10:49,654 --> 01:10:51,746
Come on, it's reindeer food.

1378
01:10:53,308 --> 01:10:55,750
That just look like
rice krispie treats.

1379
01:10:57,754 --> 01:11:00,070
Okay, what kind of
rice krispie treats do you know

1380
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:01,664
that have chocolate bars
on them?

1381
01:11:01,816 --> 01:11:03,591
Oh, yeah, that's right!

1382
01:11:03,818 --> 01:11:05,668
Oh, yeah, that makes it
totally different.

1383
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,337
See? Well, I think we're
ready for the chocolate.

1384
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:10,748
Right, because we haven't had
enough sugar today.

1385
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,767
Ah, come on, it's Christmas Eve.
That doesn't count.

1386
01:11:12,918 --> 01:11:14,660
Everyone knows that.

1387
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:17,105
- [Phone chimes]
- Oh.

1388
01:11:17,256 --> 01:11:19,590
- The road's open?
- No, it's Dani.

1389
01:11:19,684 --> 01:11:21,258
"Can't wait anymore.

1390
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:24,020
Gonna go ahead
and propose tonight."

1391
01:11:24,114 --> 01:11:26,096
They should just do it together
at the bridge.

1392
01:11:26,116 --> 01:11:29,117
Oh, I wish we could
make that happen.

1393
01:11:30,845 --> 01:11:31,786
Aww.

1394
01:11:34,774 --> 01:11:36,457
You know...

1395
01:11:38,703 --> 01:11:40,536
The roads might not be open,

1396
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:43,381
but I'm pretty sure we could
get to the bridge on foot.

1397
01:11:45,026 --> 01:11:46,950
Tell Dani you got
the perfect place

1398
01:11:47,045 --> 01:11:51,472
and to tell Amelia that
they're going to meet up with us

1399
01:11:51,699 --> 01:11:53,975
to take more pictures
around town.

1400
01:11:55,553 --> 01:11:58,888
We should get flower petals.
You know, just...

1401
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,540
Candles.

1402
01:12:00,558 --> 01:12:02,650
Oh! Definitely candles.

1403
01:12:02,877 --> 01:12:04,319
Yeah.

1404
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:19,334
Dani: This is gorgeous.

1405
01:12:19,561 --> 01:12:22,253
Amelia: It's like something
out of a fairy tale

1406
01:12:29,404 --> 01:12:30,511
Dani...

1407
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:35,165
You are...

1408
01:12:35,259 --> 01:12:39,002
The closest thing to perfection
that I've ever found.

1409
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:43,006
I've just been waiting
my entire life

1410
01:12:43,101 --> 01:12:45,943
to find someone like you.

1411
01:12:49,757 --> 01:12:51,107
[Laughs]

1412
01:12:51,259 --> 01:12:52,516
What?

1413
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:54,110
I got you one too.

1414
01:12:54,262 --> 01:12:56,120
[Laughs]
Oh, my god.

1415
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,546
Sean: Mm-hmm.

1416
01:13:05,773 --> 01:13:06,964
Boom.

1417
01:13:10,628 --> 01:13:12,720
I'm really sorry you won't
be able to make Iris' party.

1418
01:13:14,206 --> 01:13:16,465
I've made peace with it.

1419
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:19,477
You know, I'll just have to
talk to Iris some other time.

1420
01:13:20,955 --> 01:13:23,139
But...

1421
01:13:23,291 --> 01:13:26,401
I had the best day ever today.

1422
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:30,405
I love you!

1423
01:13:34,469 --> 01:13:37,803
At least you'll make
the showcase tomorrow.

1424
01:13:37,822 --> 01:13:40,748
I am so looking forward
to critiquing your work.

1425
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:44,669
[Laughs]

1426
01:13:55,657 --> 01:13:57,339
I have something special
for you.

1427
01:13:57,434 --> 01:13:58,324
Really?

1428
01:13:58,417 --> 01:14:00,493
You kinda sort of mentioned

1429
01:14:00,511 --> 01:14:02,328
that you have
a Christmas Eve tradition

1430
01:14:02,421 --> 01:14:05,606
of opening up one gift, so...

1431
01:14:08,761 --> 01:14:11,003
- Here you go.
- What?

1432
01:14:11,022 --> 01:14:13,764
Oh, you didn't have to.

1433
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:17,343
Trust me, it's not a big deal.
Just...

1434
01:14:17,361 --> 01:14:18,678
Wait, what is...

1435
01:14:18,771 --> 01:14:20,196
Yeah, right behind the tree.
Is that...

1436
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:22,031
[Gasps]

1437
01:14:22,183 --> 01:14:24,441
- You didn't.
- I did.

1438
01:14:24,535 --> 01:14:26,627
What? Oh, my gosh!

1439
01:14:26,854 --> 01:14:27,628
Yeah.

1440
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,280
Come on, you first.

1441
01:14:30,374 --> 01:14:31,549
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1442
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:36,471
[Gasps]

1443
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:40,533
My own Christmas robe.

1444
01:14:40,551 --> 01:14:41,717
Mm-hmm.

1445
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:43,385
Not blah at all.

1446
01:14:43,538 --> 01:14:45,037
Nope.

1447
01:14:45,056 --> 01:14:47,039
Thank you.

1448
01:14:47,058 --> 01:14:49,317
- Okay, my turn.
- Yeah.

1449
01:14:58,661 --> 01:14:59,744
It's perfect.

1450
01:15:01,647 --> 01:15:04,832
But when did you have time
to frame it and wrap it?

1451
01:15:04,984 --> 01:15:07,651
When you were making
our dinner.

1452
01:15:07,745 --> 01:15:10,896
One day,
when you're settled down

1453
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:12,748
and you find your home base,

1454
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:14,675
you can hang this up
on the wall

1455
01:15:14,827 --> 01:15:17,178
and remember the Christmas
photography retreat.

1456
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:23,000
I won't need a picture
to remind me, but...

1457
01:15:23,094 --> 01:15:24,435
This will be great.

1458
01:15:33,363 --> 01:15:34,436
Thank you.

1459
01:15:34,531 --> 01:15:37,031
Thank you.

1460
01:15:37,258 --> 01:15:40,276
You showed me a Christmas
I forgot long ago.

1461
01:15:40,428 --> 01:15:44,521
And the best part
about this Christmas...

1462
01:15:44,615 --> 01:15:47,041
Was being with you, Gaby.

1463
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,128
[Horn honking]

1464
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,055
[Car door opens, closes]

1465
01:16:08,639 --> 01:16:11,457
[Laughter]

1466
01:16:11,475 --> 01:16:12,549
Fran: Merry Christmas Eve!

1467
01:16:12,643 --> 01:16:14,235
Merry Christmas Eve.

1468
01:16:14,386 --> 01:16:17,296
We just wanted to come check on
you both after all that snow.

1469
01:16:17,315 --> 01:16:19,131
- Yeah.
- You drove?

1470
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:21,391
You drove!

1471
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:24,078
Yeah. Roads opened back up.
You're our first stop.

1472
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,974
They did.

1473
01:16:29,068 --> 01:16:31,068
Oh, my gosh.
That is fantastic.

1474
01:16:31,162 --> 01:16:32,587
It's a Christmas miracle!

1475
01:16:32,814 --> 01:16:34,480
Fran: Or just
hard-working plows.

1476
01:16:34,573 --> 01:16:36,591
Yeah. Maybe a little of both.

1477
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:40,428
You know what? I might be able
to make that redeye.

1478
01:16:40,579 --> 01:16:43,489
Excuse me, what is that?

1479
01:16:43,507 --> 01:16:45,582
Gaby's trying to make it
back to New York

1480
01:16:45,676 --> 01:16:49,678
in time to make this big
Christmas party tomorrow night.

1481
01:16:49,831 --> 01:16:52,014
What about the showcase?

1482
01:16:52,166 --> 01:16:57,427
Oh, well, this is basically
an interview for my dream job.

1483
01:16:57,521 --> 01:17:00,339
Oh, well, then good luck.

1484
01:17:00,358 --> 01:17:02,341
Do you want to come in?

1485
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:05,344
No, no. We're just on our way
to midnight mass.

1486
01:17:05,363 --> 01:17:07,513
We just wanted to stop by
and check on you both.

1487
01:17:07,531 --> 01:17:09,457
Glad you're all right
and good luck tomorrow.

1488
01:17:09,684 --> 01:17:10,458
Yeah.

1489
01:17:10,609 --> 01:17:11,709
Gaby: Thank you.

1490
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:19,358
[Car door opens, closes]

1491
01:17:19,377 --> 01:17:21,135
[Engine starts]

1492
01:17:22,472 --> 01:17:25,640
[Car departs]

1493
01:17:33,132 --> 01:17:34,982
There are no flights left
tonight,

1494
01:17:35,134 --> 01:17:38,635
but there are definitely a few
tomorrow morning.

1495
01:17:38,655 --> 01:17:41,213
I better pack.

1496
01:17:41,232 --> 01:17:43,473
Yeah, you should...
You should do that.

1497
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:46,827
Um, good night. Thank you
for dinner and everything.

1498
01:18:14,506 --> 01:18:15,915
What time is it?

1499
01:18:15,933 --> 01:18:20,085
Uh, it's early.
But I have good news.

1500
01:18:20,104 --> 01:18:22,345
I was able to book a flight
for 10 A.M.

1501
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,773
- That is good news.
- Yeah.

1502
01:18:24,926 --> 01:18:26,425
I'm gonna be cutting it close,

1503
01:18:26,444 --> 01:18:28,944
but I think I might be able
to make the party.

1504
01:18:29,096 --> 01:18:31,613
Well, what do you know?

1505
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:33,124
Reindeer food's gone.

1506
01:18:34,435 --> 01:18:35,876
Huh.

1507
01:18:36,028 --> 01:18:39,213
I guess Santa and his crew
came by at some point.

1508
01:18:42,293 --> 01:18:44,552
You know, it's a shame
you'll miss the showcase.

1509
01:18:44,703 --> 01:18:48,371
Yeah, well, I mean, it's either
interviewing for my dream job

1510
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:51,617
at the most prestigious party
of the year,

1511
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:53,953
or go into a retreat
photo viewing

1512
01:18:54,046 --> 01:18:55,712
at the pine falls gallery.

1513
01:18:55,732 --> 01:18:57,231
Yeah.

1514
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:02,052
Uh, about last night,

1515
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:04,572
you know, I feel like
one of us should address it.

1516
01:19:04,723 --> 01:19:08,409
It's kind of the reindeer
in the room, if you will.

1517
01:19:09,804 --> 01:19:11,487
Yeah, that was some kiss.

1518
01:19:11,639 --> 01:19:13,655
Yeah.

1519
01:19:13,808 --> 01:19:15,583
I think you're wonderful.

1520
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:19,478
At first,
I thought you were annoying,

1521
01:19:19,497 --> 01:19:21,404
a little crazy, a bit odd.

1522
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:23,499
Well, thanks.

1523
01:19:23,651 --> 01:19:26,927
But I wanted you to know I...

1524
01:19:27,154 --> 01:19:29,079
I ended up having
the best time with you.

1525
01:19:29,173 --> 01:19:30,848
- And...
- Look...

1526
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:36,920
You know how hard I've worked
for this opportunity.

1527
01:19:37,014 --> 01:19:40,441
And I know she'll see how
amazing you are. It's just...

1528
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:44,520
I hate to see you go.

1529
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:48,449
We both knew we would go our
separate ways eventually, right?

1530
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,176
I live in New York, and...

1531
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:54,371
You live nowhere
and everywhere.

1532
01:19:58,869 --> 01:20:00,702
Oh, I gotta go.

1533
01:20:00,855 --> 01:20:03,705
By the time I drop off the
rental car and everything else,

1534
01:20:03,858 --> 01:20:05,800
- go.
- I'm cutting it so close.

1535
01:20:08,287 --> 01:20:09,711
Get that job.

1536
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:12,381
And you show Iris Holmes

1537
01:20:12,533 --> 01:20:15,701
that not only are you
a great photographer

1538
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:19,313
but a newfound
Christmas enthusiast.

1539
01:20:22,893 --> 01:20:25,152
Tell everybody
I said goodbye, okay?

1540
01:20:25,304 --> 01:20:27,321
Yeah, of course.

1541
01:20:29,492 --> 01:20:30,407
Merry Christmas.

1542
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:33,327
Merry Christmas.

1543
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:46,090
Okay.

1545
01:20:59,171 --> 01:21:02,598
I'm headed to the airport now.
I should make it.

1546
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,024
Ah!

1547
01:21:04,176 --> 01:21:06,026
Good. I can breathe again.

1548
01:21:06,178 --> 01:21:08,754
I was gonna feel responsible
if you didn't make it

1549
01:21:08,847 --> 01:21:11,940
because I was the one that sent
you there in the first place.

1550
01:21:12,093 --> 01:21:13,442
Didn't factor in a storm.

1551
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:15,870
It's all good.

1552
01:21:16,021 --> 01:21:19,540
You know, everything's happening
the way it's supposed to.

1553
01:21:19,767 --> 01:21:21,542
Oh, you know what?
That reminds me.

1554
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:26,772
Can I use this photo
for our<i> style source</i> Instagram?

1555
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:29,625
It's the one of the guy
smiling by the lake.

Great. He's a cutie,
whoever he is.

1558
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:40,452
Yeah. He's really funny,
you know,

1559
01:21:40,471 --> 01:21:43,022
and kind.

1560
01:21:44,959 --> 01:21:46,475
And he's a really good cook.

1561
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:47,902
Sounds like a unicorn.

<i> All right,</i>
<i> I'll see you tonight.</i>

1563
01:21:55,302 --> 01:21:57,819
I have no doubt
that once Iris meets you,

1564
01:21:57,972 --> 01:21:59,747
she will agree
you're perfect for the job.

01:22:14,838 --> 01:22:18,340
It's so good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

1569
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:20,676
Ah, lovely work.

1570
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:22,436
Yeah, so nice.

1571
01:22:22,587 --> 01:22:23,920
[Door opens, bell rings]

1572
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:26,423
Laurie, I wanna chat with you.

1573
01:22:26,517 --> 01:22:28,167
[Door closes, bell rings]

1574
01:22:28,185 --> 01:22:30,611
Let me know if you guys need
anything else, all right?

1575
01:22:30,762 --> 01:22:32,404
- Yup.
- Okay.

1576
01:22:33,691 --> 01:22:34,573
Amelia: Hey.

1577
01:22:35,693 --> 01:22:37,117
Hey, I got a text from Gaby.

1578
01:22:37,344 --> 01:22:39,286
- It's great about the job.
- So exciting.

1579
01:22:39,513 --> 01:22:41,013
Yeah, yeah.

1580
01:22:41,031 --> 01:22:42,197
Hey, are you all right?

1581
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,516
I'll be fine.

1582
01:22:44,535 --> 01:22:47,035
You never know
what the future holds.

1583
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:48,445
Maybe.

1584
01:22:48,539 --> 01:22:50,113
Hello. Merry Christmas.

1585
01:22:50,132 --> 01:22:52,115
Oh, here come Fran and Robert.

1586
01:22:52,209 --> 01:22:54,359
We haven't told them yet.

1587
01:22:54,378 --> 01:22:56,361
Sean, you better come
to our wedding.

1588
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:59,139
We're thinking next Christmas,
maybe Alaska.

1589
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:01,392
Oh, I am so there.

1590
01:23:07,817 --> 01:23:09,233
Just a second.

1591
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,303
Merry Christmas.

1592
01:23:13,322 --> 01:23:14,655
Merry Christmas.

1593
01:23:14,806 --> 01:23:16,639
You did some great work
this week.

1594
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:18,900
Thanks. You don't have to say

1595
01:23:19,053 --> 01:23:22,237
most of my favorites
are when I went digital.

1596
01:23:22,389 --> 01:23:24,556
I may have to consider
doing it more often.

1597
01:23:24,649 --> 01:23:26,166
All thanks to Gaby,
of course.

1598
01:23:26,393 --> 01:23:28,651
Did you look
at your display yet?

1599
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:31,821
Nah, I looked at those prints
all week.

1600
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:33,899
There were some
you hadn't marked to hang,

1601
01:23:33,917 --> 01:23:36,760
but I thought they should be
displayed anyway.

1602
01:23:43,502 --> 01:23:46,578
I've been doing this
a long time.

1603
01:23:46,597 --> 01:23:49,356
I haven't found very many people
able to do this.

1604
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:51,266
Do what?

1605
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:53,193
Capture love.

1606
01:23:55,514 --> 01:23:58,181
I just...
I met her a week ago.

1607
01:23:58,275 --> 01:24:00,609
The camera doesn't lie.

1608
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:06,206
Yeah, well, unlike a photograph,
people come and go.

1609
01:24:06,433 --> 01:24:08,542
No one ever stays in frame
for too long.

1610
01:24:08,693 --> 01:24:10,044
[Door opens, bell rings]

1611
01:24:10,195 --> 01:24:11,545
You sure about that?

1612
01:24:30,974 --> 01:24:32,191
You came.

1613
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:37,321
You wanna go for a walk
with me?

1614
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:41,909
I know this really cool place
nearby.

1615
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:54,313
You know, I...
I can't believe you came.

1616
01:24:54,331 --> 01:24:59,668
I mean, what about New York,
the Christmas party?

1617
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:03,246
I got to the airport, and...

1618
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:06,082
Then it hit me.

1619
01:25:06,102 --> 01:25:09,511
I don't want to give up being
a freelance photographer.

1620
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:12,940
And if I get the staff job,
that'll be my whole life.

1621
01:25:14,184 --> 01:25:15,684
I love fashion,

1622
01:25:15,778 --> 01:25:19,596
but I want to explore
all elements of photography,

1623
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:22,783
all subjects, all themes.

1624
01:25:22,934 --> 01:25:24,618
[Sighs]
So...

1625
01:25:27,105 --> 01:25:30,182
I told Leila
I wanted to be free,

1626
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,774
to have it all.

1627
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:33,627
[Sean chuckles]

1628
01:25:33,778 --> 01:25:36,613
You could even dip your toe
into wildlife photography.

1629
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:38,090
Exactly.

1630
01:25:41,303 --> 01:25:43,695
Leila didn't feel warmth
and emotions in my pictures

1631
01:25:43,714 --> 01:25:45,547
because...

1632
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:48,867
I didn't feel them
when I was taking them.

1633
01:25:48,886 --> 01:25:52,128
Being a good photographer
means living life...

1634
01:25:52,148 --> 01:25:55,107
And sharing life.

1635
01:25:56,894 --> 01:26:00,988
And I didn't know that
until I got here.

1636
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:11,223
After you went to bed
last night,

1637
01:26:11,316 --> 01:26:14,242
I started to look for apartments
in New York City.

1638
01:26:14,395 --> 01:26:16,170
You did?

1639
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:20,749
And you were right.

1640
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:22,676
You know, I need a...

1641
01:26:22,827 --> 01:26:25,070
I need a home base.

1642
01:26:25,088 --> 01:26:27,330
A place to hang my pictures.

1643
01:26:27,424 --> 01:26:30,684
A place to make new Christmas
traditions with someone?

1644
01:26:32,837 --> 01:26:34,313
My thoughts exactly.
