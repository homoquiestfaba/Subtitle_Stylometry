00:17:10,812 --> 00:17:11,813
It's beautiful.

190
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,351
-What are you doing? -Oops!

191
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:17,986
I dropped it.

192
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:19,154
Peter.

193
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:20,388
It's all right.

194
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:22,958
I'll find it.

195
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:24,593
[giggling]

196
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:31,366
[Danitra] Ow!

197
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:36,471
[grunts]

198
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:40,976
Okay, Charlie, let's make this quick.

199
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:43,445
It's been a long night and my feet are killing me!

200
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:47,582
So what's up? What you gotta tell me?

201
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:54,356
Oh, Charlie, I thought you were straight, man.

202
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:17,512
[grunts]

203
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:32,861
[gunshot]

204
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,901
[indistinct chatter]

205
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:05,827
[Captain] Security guard found them around 5:30 this morning.

206
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,229
She was shot once in the back of the head,

207
00:19:08,296 --> 00:19:09,364
point-blank.

208
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:14,102
Approximately 15 to 20 grams of heroin

209
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:15,637
were found in her purse.

210
00:19:16,371 --> 00:19:17,672
She was clean.

211
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:20,041
I know.

212
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:22,644
But there will still have to be an investigation.

213
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:27,916
The overdose worked for Kent Construction.

214
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:31,286
Name's Charles Vasquez.

215
00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:32,654
Did you know him?

216
00:19:34,055 --> 00:19:35,757
He called Danny to set up the meeting.

217
00:19:36,324 --> 00:19:37,525
Why?

218
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:41,896
If I knew why, she wouldn't be dead.

219
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:54,309
They killed...

220
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,510
They killed my baby.

221
00:19:57,412 --> 00:19:59,614
I'll get him man, I'll get him.

222
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:01,182
[Albers] The two most important things are--

223
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:03,718
Get the bullet over to Ballistics immediately,

224
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,521
and I'd like to see a copy of that blood panel.

225
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:09,190
Who knows? Maybe she was dirty.

226
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:14,729
[grunts in pain]

227
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,069
[music plays on videotape]

228
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:37,919
[turns off tape]

229
00:20:40,221 --> 00:20:43,691
Apparently, there's been a breach in security, Ellis.

230
00:20:43,758 --> 00:20:45,860
Now who do you suppose it was?

231
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:48,329
It must've been Donald.

232
00:20:48,396 --> 00:20:50,031
Yes.

233
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:51,699
Must've been Donald.

234
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:53,668
Tucked away there, safely in prison,

235
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:55,837
lifting his weights,

236
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:57,772
and discussing my security system

237
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,909
with every convict he takes a long shower with.

238
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:04,846
We could get somebody inside.

239
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:07,081
It's a little late for that now, don't you think?

240
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:09,083
Ellis?

241
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:13,655
And since you're head of security,

242
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:15,623
I'm afraid I have to hold you accountable.

243
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:18,059
Bob.

244
00:21:22,463 --> 00:21:23,898
Tito...

245
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:25,700
You're new head of security.

246
00:21:27,368 --> 00:21:29,871
Jeremy, I'll need to have lunch with Mr. Kent.

247
00:21:29,938 --> 00:21:32,540
And let's make sure he doesn't have anymore nervous employees

248
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:36,511
like Mr. Vasquez, who need to make calls to the police department.

249
00:21:37,445 --> 00:21:38,780
Tito,

250
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:41,482
I know I don't have to tell you what to do.

251
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:43,852
[chuckling] Yeah, but I will.

252
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:46,721
I want you to track down our little intruder.

253
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:51,226
And get that fucking card back!

254
00:21:58,466 --> 00:21:59,500
[woman] Police Department.

255
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,069
Good evening.

256
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:02,570
I'd like to report a burglary.

257
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:03,571
Address?

258
00:22:03,638 --> 00:22:05,240
California Jewelry Mart.

259
00:22:05,306 --> 00:22:07,242
-California Jewelry Mart. -That's right.

260
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:08,376
Your name, sir?

261
00:22:08,443 --> 00:22:09,811
Oh.

262
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:12,547
And could you please send that nice detective Jade?

263
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:14,716
-Who is this? -Thank you!

264
00:22:14,782 --> 00:22:17,252
Who is this? Sir? Hello--

265
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:50,818
[chuckling]

266
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:53,054
Teach you to shoot at me.

267
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,255
[crackling]

268
00:22:55,456 --> 00:22:57,158
[grunts] Whoa!

269
00:22:58,226 --> 00:22:59,360
[siren]

270
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:06,200
I didn't do it.

271
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:16,945
You have the right to remain silent.

272
00:23:17,011 --> 00:23:19,213
As a matter of fact, I insist on it.

273
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,320
Come on, man. This isn't funny!

274
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:26,821
It is where I'm standin'.

275
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:29,891
David, I said I was sorry!

276
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:34,195
All right, all right. Wait a minute. Come here.

277
00:23:37,765 --> 00:23:40,501
Okay. How much do you want?

278
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:42,704
-You tryin' to bribe me? -Naturally.

279
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,706
Forget it, asswipe.

280
00:23:44,772 --> 00:23:46,941
You got all the bad chromosomes, not me.

281
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,978
I'll see you in 20 years.

282
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:51,980
David! You better let me out of here

283
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:53,681
Or I swear I'll get you for this.

284
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:56,050
Oh, oh! You'll get me?

285
00:23:56,117 --> 00:23:59,287
Take a look around you. You see all these guys?

286
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,990
They don't like me very much. You know why?

287
00:24:02,056 --> 00:24:05,093
'Cause I put every one of their asses in here.

288
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,327
[whistles]

289
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:08,129
Yo, hey, everybody!

290
00:24:08,863 --> 00:24:11,165
This is my brother.

291
00:24:14,402 --> 00:24:15,370
David!

292
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,372
David!

293
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:18,873
David!

294
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:21,876
[siren wails]

295
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:29,017
[Sinclair] Detective Jade.

296
00:24:31,252 --> 00:24:32,420
Detective Jade.

297
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,389
Yeah.

298
00:24:34,455 --> 00:24:35,757
What's this?

299
00:24:35,823 --> 00:24:37,458
The financial report on Charles Vasquez.

300
00:24:38,126 --> 00:24:39,127
Right.

301
00:24:39,193 --> 00:24:40,928
He was pulling down some serious cash

302
00:24:40,995 --> 00:24:42,497
for a construction worker.

303
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:44,332
It looks like he was doing some moonlighting.

304
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:46,534
Thanks, Sinclair.

305
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:47,835
No problem.

306
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:51,105
How about buying some cookies from my kid?

307
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,143
Jade, Chief's Office.

308
00:24:55,209 --> 00:24:56,010
Wait a sec.

309
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,745
No "just a sec." Now.

310
00:24:58,713 --> 00:24:59,981
Sorry.

311
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,627
Detective Jade,

312
00:25:12,694 --> 00:25:14,095
this is Steven Tarlow

313
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:15,897
from the District Attorney's office

314
00:25:15,963 --> 00:25:17,932
and Agent Regan from the FBI.

315
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:20,868
Hi. Nice to meet you.

316
00:25:20,935 --> 00:25:22,437
You'll have to excuse my voice.

317
00:25:22,503 --> 00:25:25,073
I've been screaming at assholes all morning.

318
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:27,508
But before we get into this,

319
00:25:27,575 --> 00:25:29,477
I just wanted to say

320
00:25:29,544 --> 00:25:32,313
that I was sorry to hear about your partner.

321
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,284
The entire department grieves for her husband and family.

322
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:40,421
But Detective Jade, you assaulted a fellow officer

323
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:43,858
and put Lieutenant Albers in the hospital.

324
00:25:43,925 --> 00:25:45,860
Now, what do you have to say about that?

325
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:48,563
I should've put him in the morgue.

326
00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:52,366
You know damn well that that shit doesn't go very far with me!

327
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:56,571
You're a good cop, Jade, but you've got to learn to control your temper!

328
00:25:56,637 --> 00:26:00,475
This is the last episode I want to hear about you.

329
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:03,277
Am I making myself clear?

330
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:04,946
Yes, sir.

331
00:26:05,012 --> 00:26:06,881
Chief, may we please?

332
00:26:06,948 --> 00:26:09,050
All right.

333
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:10,785
I knew this wasn't going to be easy for you,

334
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:14,188
so I wanted to be here to introduce you to your new partner.

335
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,902
What's he doin' here?

336
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:30,438
This is your new partner.

337
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:32,640
No way!

338
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:34,242
Yes way!

339
00:26:34,308 --> 00:26:36,777
Suspect's legal counsel has convinced the DA's office

340
00:26:36,844 --> 00:26:39,480
that your brother may have evidence which will assist us

341
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:40,781
in a federal prosecution.

342
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:42,583
-No way! -Yes way!

343
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,086
The suspect's been given immunity for the burglaries

344
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:47,522
providing he can produce the evidence

345
00:26:47,588 --> 00:26:50,725
which will aid in the conviction of an alleged money-launderer.

346
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:51,826
No way!

347
00:26:51,893 --> 00:26:53,227
Yes way!

348
00:26:53,294 --> 00:26:55,163
You are to accompany the suspect

349
00:26:55,229 --> 00:26:56,531
and retrieve the evidence in question.

350
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:58,833
Gotcha.

351
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,936
Wait a second. I can't believe you guys bought this bullshit.

352
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:03,337
Can't you see he's lying?

353
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:05,740
He'll say anything to keep from going to jail.

354
00:27:05,806 --> 00:27:07,875
Um, objection, Your Honor.

355
00:27:07,942 --> 00:27:09,510
I know this guy!

356
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:11,512
You can't trust him. He'll try to get away.

357
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:14,882
That's why we're sending Agent Regan along with you.

358
00:27:14,949 --> 00:27:16,984
Look forward to workin' with you, Dave.

359
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:20,288
Oh, forget it. Get yourself a new boy.

360
00:27:20,354 --> 00:27:21,422
I ain't doin' it.

361
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:23,824
Jade, this is not an elective assignment.

362
00:27:23,891 --> 00:27:25,026
Why me?

363
00:27:25,092 --> 00:27:26,427
Yeah, why him?

364
00:27:26,494 --> 00:27:29,330
Believe me, you were not my first choice.

365
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,099
You put my first choice in the hospital.

366
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:34,068
I'm sorry, but I ain't doin' it.

367
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:36,771
Detective, need I remind you?

368
00:27:36,837 --> 00:27:38,439
You work for me.

369
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:40,741
Not anymore.

370
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:42,310
I quit.

371
00:27:45,813 --> 00:27:48,316
See, I told you he was a quitter.

372
00:27:57,658 --> 00:27:58,726
After you,

373
00:27:58,793 --> 00:27:59,994
partner.

374
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,975
Hey, how're you doing? I'm Peter.

375
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,376
Oh, I'm Whitney.

376
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,911
-Whitney. Like Whitney Houston? -Yeah.

377
00:28:16,978 --> 00:28:18,579
Oh, what a geek!

378
00:28:18,646 --> 00:28:20,047
Hey, I gotta pee.

379
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:21,949
Whitney, go with him.

380
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:23,884
Hey, I'm just goin' to the bathroom.

381
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:25,486
Whitney, go with him.

382
00:28:33,527 --> 00:28:34,662
Don't mind if I do.

383
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:39,467
[zipper zips]

384
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:42,003
Excuse me, Whitney, but I'm kinda pee-shy.

385
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,982
Come on, little fella.

386
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,657
Yep, I really gotta pee like a race horse.

387
00:29:04,592 --> 00:29:05,993
Ahh...

388
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:17,071
So, Whitney where ya from?

389
00:29:18,372 --> 00:29:20,541
Uh, originally from Philadelphia.

390
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:24,278
We moved to Connecticut after dad retired from banking.

391
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,681
Oh, yeah. Tell me a little bit about your family.

392
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,884
Well, uh...

393
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,552
I'm English on my mom's side.

394
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,855
Irish on my dad's side.

395
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:36,457
Which makes me, uh...

396
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:39,560
English-Irish.

397
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,239
Goin' somewhere?

398
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:54,141
Just, uh, testing the waters.

399
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:56,143
They're cold and deep.

400
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,978
Do you want to drown?

401
00:29:58,045 --> 00:29:59,547
Get back up there.

402
00:30:03,684 --> 00:30:06,354
And then there's Trisha, that's my youngest sister.

403
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,289
She just had her debutante's ball.

404
00:30:08,356 --> 00:30:11,192
And then there's my older sister, Elaine.

405
00:30:11,258 --> 00:30:14,128
I tell ya, she is one hell of a tennis player.

406
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:16,764
You'd never know that one of her legs is shorter than the other.

407
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,268
Ah, shit.

408
00:30:21,335 --> 00:30:23,037
My folks got her these specially made tennis shoes

409
00:30:23,104 --> 00:30:25,840
with the sole about an inch thicker on the left side...

410
00:30:25,906 --> 00:30:27,208
[toilet flushing]

411
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:28,509
Or was it the right side?

412
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:31,412
You all set?

413
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:36,117
No matter how much you shake it,

414
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:37,651
the last drop always goes down your leg.

415
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:56,170
So who is this money-launderer, anyway?

416
00:30:56,237 --> 00:30:58,239
His name is Philip Chamberlain.

417
00:30:58,305 --> 00:30:59,607
He owns the diamond company

418
00:30:59,673 --> 00:31:01,976
your brother inadvertently broke into.

419
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:03,444
Inadvertently?

420
00:31:03,511 --> 00:31:05,780
Yeah, it means "unintentionally."

421
00:31:05,846 --> 00:31:08,549
We believe Chamberlain is using the diamond company

422
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,785
to transfer drug money out of the country.

423
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:13,220
So why don't you just go bust his ass?

424
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:14,455
It's not that easy.

425
00:31:16,056 --> 00:31:17,291
He's got a shining public image,

426
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:18,692
he's politically well-connected,

427
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:19,960
heavy contributor,

428
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:22,430
Board of Directors for the children's hospital,

429
00:31:22,496 --> 00:31:24,498
I tell you, until your brother decided to cooperate,

430
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:26,267
we really didn't have much to go on.

431
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,536
Well, I thought it was my civic duty.

432
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:32,873
Okay, George Washington, where's the evidence?

433
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,608
Chill, bro, we'll get to it.

434
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:37,311
But first I gotta stop off at my house and change clothes.

435
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:39,947
I smell like a jail cell.

436
00:31:40,014 --> 00:31:41,382
Might as well get used to it.

437
00:31:42,716 --> 00:31:46,554
You know, you two really do look alike.

438
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,255
-Shut up, Whitney! -Shut up, Whitney!

439
00:32:06,307 --> 00:32:07,775
[girls] Hi, Peter!

440
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,810
Hi, ladies.

441
00:32:09,877 --> 00:32:12,146
Oh. Uh, this is my brother,

442
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:14,582
and, um, my sister.

443
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:16,784
[girls laugh]

444
00:32:22,123 --> 00:32:24,225
[Whitney] Wow, you live here?

445
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:26,293
[Peter] Only during bikini season.

446
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:29,797
I guess crime does pay.

447
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,799
Come over to the dark side, Luke.

448
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,734
Why don't you stick it in your dark side.

449
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,441
Oh, just a sec.

450
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,725
Maid's day off?

451
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:02,496
What a shame.

452
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,832
This was a museum-quality piece.

453
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,734
I ought to know, I stole it from a museum.

454
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:08,602
[vase breaks]

455
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:10,237
Whatever you took from these guys

456
00:33:10,304 --> 00:33:12,106
they want back awful bad.

457
00:33:12,172 --> 00:33:15,176
All this over a couple of lousy diamonds. Can you believe it?

458
00:33:15,242 --> 00:33:18,279
No, I can't. So you wanna tell me what's goin' on?

459
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:20,447
[Whitney] The rest of the premises are secure.

460
00:33:21,415 --> 00:33:22,683
Thanks, Whitney.

461
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,485
I feel safer knowing that you're here.

462
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:26,687
So, uh...

463
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:27,821
You guys hungry?

464
00:33:27,888 --> 00:33:30,524
Can I fix you some coffee and donuts?

465
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,626
Get dressed.

466
00:33:45,105 --> 00:33:48,342
[Whitney] Whoa! You've got more machines here than my gym.

467
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:50,210
[Peter] Want 'em? I don't use 'em anymore.

468
00:33:50,277 --> 00:33:52,446
Too much work. I use this thing now.

469
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:59,486
-Check it out... -[spits]

470
00:33:59,553 --> 00:34:01,689
It's called "passive muscle stimulation."

471
00:34:01,755 --> 00:34:04,625
The machine sends an electrical impulse to the muscle tissue,

472
00:34:04,692 --> 00:34:07,294
causing an involuntary reflex.

473
00:34:07,361 --> 00:34:08,762
-[crackles] -Ow!

474
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:09,730
That hurt!

475
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,532
I had it amped up a little bit.

476
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,902
Always lookin' for a way to get out of doing any work.

477
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,471
That's what separates us humans from the rest of you

478
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:19,406
in the animal kingdom.

479
00:34:20,207 --> 00:34:21,241
Let's go.

480
00:34:21,308 --> 00:34:22,476
I need my shoes!

481
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:23,611
Whitney, get his shoes.

482
00:34:23,677 --> 00:34:25,045
I wanna pick 'em out!

483
00:34:25,112 --> 00:34:26,146
Whitney, get his shoes.

484
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:27,548
But I don't trust his taste.

485
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:29,583
Brown Italian loafers with double tassels.

486
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,651
Okay.

487
00:34:31,685 --> 00:34:32,686
[grunts]

488
00:34:41,228 --> 00:34:43,163
Start talkin' or start bleedin'.

489
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,498
And do what he says.

490
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:46,467
Those steroids make him unpredictable.

491
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:51,038
See what I mean?

492
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:52,373
I don't take any steroids,

493
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:53,674
and I don't take any shit!

494
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:55,976
Are you always this macho?

495
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:57,478
Let's hear it.

496
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:01,882
I said let's hear it!

497
00:35:04,218 --> 00:35:07,655
Hey, Dave, why not let the machine do the work for you?

498
00:35:16,463 --> 00:35:17,698
Who sent you?

499
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:21,301
[crackling]

500
00:35:21,368 --> 00:35:22,903
[screaming]

501
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,039
[screaming]

502
00:35:25,105 --> 00:35:26,040
Tito.

503
00:35:26,807 --> 00:35:28,275
Tito?

504
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:29,610
Know anyone named Tito?

505
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:32,079
[crackling]

506
00:35:32,146 --> 00:35:35,182
[screaming]

507
00:35:35,249 --> 00:35:37,284
I don't know his last name!

508
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:39,453
Where can I find Tito?

509
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,921
[crackling intensifies]

510
00:35:40,988 --> 00:35:43,090
[screaming]

511
00:35:43,157 --> 00:35:45,459
Grand Promenade. He's up at the penthouse.

512
00:35:49,129 --> 00:35:50,130
[grunts in pain]

513
00:35:54,768 --> 00:35:57,671
Better not be lyin' to me, 'cause I'm comin' back!

514
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:02,910
[groaning]

515
00:36:02,976 --> 00:36:03,877
What about Whitney?

516
00:36:05,646 --> 00:36:06,747
What about him?

517
00:36:08,882 --> 00:36:10,517
[door closes]

518
00:36:17,558 --> 00:36:21,495
Stop! The g-forces are killing me!

519
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:25,432
Well, they'll never hear us coming in

520
00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:27,534
the stealth car!

521
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:30,504
What have you got in this thing, a tractor engine or something?

522
00:36:30,571 --> 00:36:31,739
Why don't we take my car?

523
00:36:31,805 --> 00:36:33,407
Because you probably stole it.

524
00:36:33,474 --> 00:36:35,142
I did not steal it.

525
00:36:35,209 --> 00:36:38,145
I paid for it with some hard-earned money that I stole.

526
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:41,048
So, after all that time in prison, you didn't learn nothin'?

527
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,117
I learned where those diamonds were, didn't I?

528
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,495
Dave, you just passed it.

529
00:36:54,561 --> 00:36:56,563
Grab the wheel a second, will ya?

530
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,502
[tires squealing]

531
00:37:05,572 --> 00:37:06,673
Hey, what is this?

532
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,208
You're stayin' here.

533
00:37:08,275 --> 00:37:10,744
Come on, man, I thought we were partners.

534
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,679
Let's get one thing straight.

535
00:37:12,746 --> 00:37:15,215
You are not my partner.

536
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,125
[sighs]

537
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:08,202
[desk clerk] Hello, Mrs. Larson.

538
00:38:08,268 --> 00:38:09,136
Good day.

539
00:38:10,971 --> 00:38:12,139
Hi.

540
00:38:21,381 --> 00:38:22,549
Press "P," please.

541
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:24,618
The penthouse is locked.

542
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:26,420
You'll have to go back downstairs

543
00:38:26,486 --> 00:38:28,522
and ask the guard to call the tenant.

544
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:29,957
After you've been announced,

545
00:38:30,023 --> 00:38:32,259
the guard will open the floor with the pass key.

546
00:38:33,126 --> 00:38:34,528
[sighs loudly]

547
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:35,963
Thank you.

548
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,028
[grunts]

549
00:39:11,398 --> 00:39:13,400
You stole my steering wheel?

550
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:14,868
Here. You can have it back.

551
00:39:18,505 --> 00:39:20,240
Still mad?

552
00:39:20,307 --> 00:39:22,509
How'd you get the pass key?

553
00:39:22,576 --> 00:39:23,744
From the guard.

554
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:39,660
[knocking on door]

555
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,712
It's the guard from downstairs.

556
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:00,647
Give him a hundred bucks and get rid of him.

557
00:40:07,554 --> 00:40:08,755
Knock-knock.

558
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:11,792
Freeze!

559
00:40:20,434 --> 00:40:21,735
Bring the car around!

560
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,377
David!

561
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,417
You're welcome.

562
00:41:41,214 --> 00:41:42,382
[screaming]

563
00:41:44,317 --> 00:41:46,953
Dave, the suspects are getting away.

564
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,956
[yelling]

565
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:56,363
Get the money!

566
00:41:58,832 --> 00:41:59,733
[screaming]

567
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,934
[grunts]

568
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:16,783
Cool!

569
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,419
[screaming]

570
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:27,961
Who is that!

571
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,483
Come on, come on! Let's go, let's go!

572
00:42:58,925 --> 00:43:00,460
[whistling]

573
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:02,929
[tires squealing]

574
00:43:20,714 --> 00:43:23,183
Aw, come on Dave, cheer up.

575
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:25,552
There'll be other bad guys.

576
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,554
Shut up. It's all your fault.

577
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:29,022
Why is it my fault?

578
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:30,423
'Cause if you hadn't taken the steering wheel,

579
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,526
they wouldn't have gotten away.

580
00:43:32,592 --> 00:43:34,995
Hey, it's 411... If I hadn't clubbed that guy with the steering wheel,

581
00:43:35,061 --> 00:43:36,763
you'd be in the ghost police.

582
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:38,265
Yeah. But I wouldn't have been there in the first place,

583
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:40,100
if you hadn't stolen those diamonds!

584
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:42,369
I wouldn't have never stolen anything in the first place,

585
00:43:42,435 --> 00:43:44,371
if you hadn't been such a goody two-shoes!

586
00:43:44,437 --> 00:43:46,373
What the hell are you talking about?

587
00:43:46,439 --> 00:43:49,576
Oh. "David did his homework, and David made his bed.

588
00:43:49,643 --> 00:43:51,278
Isn't David a darling?

589
00:43:51,344 --> 00:43:53,146
Peter, why can't you be more like your brother David?

590
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,815
David, David, David, David!"

591
00:43:54,881 --> 00:43:58,552
I'm talkin' about you, the boy scout of the decade!

592
00:43:58,618 --> 00:44:00,954
So you're sayin' it's my fault you're a criminal?

593
00:44:01,021 --> 00:44:02,589
Well, that's one theory I have.

594
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:04,391
The other one has to do with the breastfeeding.

595
00:44:06,193 --> 00:44:07,794
Hey, check it out.

596
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:09,796
Souvenir from Tito's place.

597
00:44:09,863 --> 00:44:10,797
What is it?

598
00:44:10,864 --> 00:44:12,332
A blasting cap,

599
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,234
A detonating device used by construction workers.

600
00:44:16,002 --> 00:44:17,904
Construction worker.

601
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:20,040
Yeah, or some criminal element

602
00:44:20,106 --> 00:44:22,342
that wanted to set off a larger explosion.

603
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,077
They're pretty harmless by themselves.

604
00:44:28,882 --> 00:44:30,884
[whistling]

605
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,592
[Peter] okay, buddy,

606
00:44:38,658 --> 00:44:41,328
now it's time to play round two of "shock the monkey."

607
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:47,234
You know, I've always been afraid to try this thing on myself.

608
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,602
But I'm curious to find out

609
00:44:48,668 --> 00:44:51,037
if it can make your dick muscles bigger.

610
00:45:01,514 --> 00:45:02,382
Shit!

611
00:45:03,016 --> 00:45:04,284
He's alive.

612
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:10,290
I better call the police.

613
00:45:10,357 --> 00:45:11,858
You're not calling anybody.

614
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:13,960
You're going to tell me what these people are after,

615
00:45:14,027 --> 00:45:16,529
and I don't want to hear anymore bullshit about diamonds either.

616
00:45:16,596 --> 00:45:19,332
Dave, I swear to you, man, that's all I took.

617
00:45:19,399 --> 00:45:21,501
Hey, you were right all along.

618
00:45:21,568 --> 00:45:23,169
I made up all that junk about evidence

619
00:45:23,236 --> 00:45:25,071
just so I could stay out of jail.

620
00:45:25,138 --> 00:45:27,507
You are a hell of a cop.

621
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,343
And you're a hell of a liar.

622
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:33,446
You're gonna tell me the truth or I'm gonna kick your ass.

623
00:45:33,513 --> 00:45:35,582
Did you say you're gonna kick my ass?

624
00:45:36,549 --> 00:45:38,118
Sorry, can't touch this.

625
00:45:40,787 --> 00:45:42,122
[grunts in pain]

626
00:45:43,256 --> 00:45:45,158
Sorry, little brother, but I warned ya.

627
00:45:49,629 --> 00:45:51,998
[screaming]

628
00:46:13,053 --> 00:46:14,621
[tires squeal]

629
00:46:31,504 --> 00:46:34,941
Slow down! There's two huge men wrestling in the back seat

630
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:36,743
of our car!

631
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,111
Ah, shut up.

632
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:48,221
[woman] Hey, Peter.

633
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:49,456
Hi, how you doin'?

634
00:46:52,058 --> 00:46:54,361
[both growling]

635
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,699
-[woman screaming] -[glass breaking]

636
00:47:37,237 --> 00:47:38,705
[laughing]

637
00:47:42,108 --> 00:47:43,510
You hungry?

638
00:47:43,576 --> 00:47:45,311
Starved.

639
00:47:45,378 --> 00:47:46,813
Let's get somethin' to eat.

640
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,095
Don't you ever swallow?

641
00:48:03,663 --> 00:48:07,300
So, uh, whatever became of the straight-A student?

642
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:08,768
Why'd you drop out?

643
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:11,871
Someone had to work.

644
00:48:11,938 --> 00:48:13,706
Dad couldn't, and you were in jail.

645
00:48:16,075 --> 00:48:19,045
That's all right. He wouldn't have remembered you anyway.

646
00:48:19,112 --> 00:48:22,348
What's the name of that thing he had? "Old-timers?"

647
00:48:23,149 --> 00:48:24,818
Alzheimer's.

648
00:48:24,884 --> 00:48:26,886
Yeah, yeah. He turned into, like, Ronald Reagan, you know.

649
00:48:29,155 --> 00:48:30,757
He couldn't remember anything.

650
00:48:33,092 --> 00:48:35,328
Then one day, I guess, uh...

651
00:48:35,395 --> 00:48:37,197
He couldn't remember to wake up.

652
00:48:41,034 --> 00:48:43,403
Why aren't you eating? I thought you were hungry.

653
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:45,305
Are you kidding? I can't eat that junk!

654
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:47,507
It's full of carcinogens.

655
00:48:47,574 --> 00:48:49,309
You should ask for them on the side.

656
00:48:50,743 --> 00:48:51,978
Come on!

657
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:53,480
Let's hose you down and go get something edible.

658
00:48:53,546 --> 00:48:55,782
Wait a minute. I'm not finished yet.

659
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,350
I'm not finished yet!

660
00:49:08,828 --> 00:49:09,829
Come on, will ya?

661
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:20,073
-I hate this. -What's your problem?

662
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,876
It reminds me of kindergarten. I hated wearing the same clothes.

663
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,678
They're not the same.

664
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:27,480
There's a very fine pinstripe going through it.

665
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,282
Oh, yeah, they're much different.

666
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:31,217
Look, when we get outside, you can roll around in the mud,

667
00:49:31,284 --> 00:49:32,552
and you'll feel better.

668
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:35,388
Now, will you shut up? You look great.

669
00:49:35,455 --> 00:49:38,258
No, I don't. I look like you.

670
00:49:38,324 --> 00:49:40,360
-[kissing] -Gentlemen, this way, please.

671
00:49:51,804 --> 00:49:52,672
There you go.

672
00:49:53,873 --> 00:49:54,807
Enjoy.

673
00:49:58,778 --> 00:50:00,413
Pick up your menu.

674
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,315
It's in French. I'm not impressed.

675
00:50:02,382 --> 00:50:04,384
Pick up your menu.

676
00:50:08,354 --> 00:50:09,923
Now, look across the room.

677
00:50:11,691 --> 00:50:13,526
See the guy over there in the gray suit?

678
00:50:15,028 --> 00:50:16,663
That's your boy.

679
00:50:16,729 --> 00:50:18,398
Chamberlain?

680
00:50:18,464 --> 00:50:20,166
How'd you know he'd be here?

681
00:50:20,233 --> 00:50:21,768
Because he eats here every day.

682
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:23,670
You don't think I just break into people's safes

683
00:50:23,736 --> 00:50:26,072
without finding out who owns them first, do you?

684
00:50:26,139 --> 00:50:27,273
Who's the guy he's with?

685
00:50:33,913 --> 00:50:36,549
Looks like those Patty Duke pills just kicked in.

686
00:50:37,116 --> 00:50:38,551
Okay, I give up.

687
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,753
Which one of you adores a minuet?

688
00:50:43,222 --> 00:50:44,857
Son of a bitch!

689
00:50:44,924 --> 00:50:46,259
What are we gonna do?

690
00:50:46,326 --> 00:50:47,694
First place...

691
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,029
[chuckling]

692
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:53,866
We are not going to panic.

693
00:50:54,334 --> 00:50:55,868
Second,

694
00:50:55,935 --> 00:50:59,706
I want your men ready to engage at any moment.

695
00:50:59,772 --> 00:51:03,009
It's a 31-hour plane trip between Los Angeles and Johannesburg,

696
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:06,145
including a four-hour layover in Geneva.

697
00:51:06,212 --> 00:51:08,314
This means that Mr. Roselyn

698
00:51:08,381 --> 00:51:11,784
will not be officially reported missing for another eight hours

699
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:14,954
when his plane lands in South Africa without him.

700
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:19,759
Now, barring the miracle of a plane crash,

701
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:23,363
this leaves us eight hours in which to retrieve the card

702
00:51:23,429 --> 00:51:25,798
and execute the operation.

703
00:51:25,865 --> 00:51:28,935
If, however, at the end of the seventh hour,

704
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,937
the card is still absent,

705
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:33,606
you and your men will proceed without it.

706
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:36,709
It's too dangerous.

707
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:41,214
Life is dangerous, Mr. Kent.

708
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,816
You could walk out onto this street this very afternoon

709
00:51:43,883 --> 00:51:46,786
and, suddenly, be struck by a speeding car.

710
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,554
I don't like it.

711
00:51:49,756 --> 00:51:52,191
Stewart's not gonna like it either.

712
00:51:52,258 --> 00:51:55,261
Mr. Kent, I've spent several years

713
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:56,663
and several millions

714
00:51:56,729 --> 00:51:58,297
planning this venture,

715
00:51:58,364 --> 00:52:00,933
and I'm not about to let anything

716
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,669
or anyone impair it.

717
00:52:03,269 --> 00:52:04,937
So I suggest,

718
00:52:05,004 --> 00:52:07,540
that you have a little talk with Mr. Stewart,

719
00:52:08,508 --> 00:52:09,876
before I do.

720
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,181
It would be, too, tragic

721
00:52:15,248 --> 00:52:18,117
if you were both struck by the same speeding car.

722
00:52:42,842 --> 00:52:44,277
[Peter] Okay, so now we know

723
00:52:44,343 --> 00:52:45,812
where Tito gets his blasting caps,

724
00:52:45,878 --> 00:52:48,481
but, uh, shouldn't we be following Chamberlain?

725
00:52:48,548 --> 00:52:51,951
-No. -May I ask you why?

726
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:53,886
A construction worker named Vasquez

727
00:52:53,953 --> 00:52:55,621
set up a meeting with my partner to tell her something

728
00:52:55,688 --> 00:52:57,523
got them both killed.

729
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,525
Vasquez worked for Kent.

730
00:52:59,592 --> 00:53:01,627
So you think Kent had something to do with it?

731
00:53:02,462 --> 00:53:04,230
Shit rolls downhill.

732
00:53:04,297 --> 00:53:05,865
Let's see where it rolls next.

733
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:20,947
Good afternoon, Mr. Kent.

734
00:53:28,654 --> 00:53:30,957
Excuse me, sir. This is a private club.

735
00:53:31,023 --> 00:53:32,024
Police.

736
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:40,466
Excuse me, did I just go in there?

737
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:41,801
Thanks.

738
00:54:01,654 --> 00:54:03,055
We've got trouble.

739
00:54:12,098 --> 00:54:14,000
[inaudible conversation]

740
00:54:16,702 --> 00:54:18,070
Son of a bitch!

741
00:54:18,137 --> 00:54:20,640
-You know him? -Yeah, I voted for him.

742
00:54:20,706 --> 00:54:23,743
North district City Councilman, Leonard Stewart.

743
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:27,313
Oh, I see you voted the scumbag party.

744
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,582
Yeah, politicians are nice people.

745
00:54:29,649 --> 00:54:31,117
Everybody should own one.

746
00:54:33,352 --> 00:54:35,855
Looks like your councilman's close to the edge.

747
00:54:36,889 --> 00:54:39,158
Yeah. Let's push him over.

748
00:54:48,234 --> 00:54:49,168
Hey!

749
00:54:50,102 --> 00:54:51,204
What's goin' on?

750
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:56,209
Let me outta here.

751
00:54:56,275 --> 00:54:58,010
Relax, councilman.

752
00:54:58,077 --> 00:54:59,946
You've still got some skin left.

753
00:55:00,012 --> 00:55:03,449
Who is it? What do you want?

754
00:55:03,516 --> 00:55:05,751
This is a warning, councilman.

755
00:55:05,818 --> 00:55:08,988
I know you're dirty, and I'm on to you.

756
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,857
You lunatic, let me outta here.

757
00:55:10,923 --> 00:55:15,261
We know all about you and Kent and Chamberlain.

758
00:55:17,263 --> 00:55:19,565
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

759
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:22,835
No? Well you better get used to the heat, councilman,

760
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:25,204
'cause your ass is gonna fry.

761
00:55:25,271 --> 00:55:26,405
Ah!

762
00:55:26,472 --> 00:55:28,608
[maniacal laughter]

763
00:55:28,674 --> 00:55:30,076
Help!

764
00:55:30,142 --> 00:55:31,143
Help!

765
00:55:32,211 --> 00:55:33,145
Help!

766
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,248
Help!

767
00:55:36,282 --> 00:55:37,450
Help!

768
00:55:37,516 --> 00:55:39,919
-Think that did it? -Not quite.

769
00:55:39,986 --> 00:55:41,254
Help!

770
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,488
Help!

771
00:55:42,555 --> 00:55:43,656
Help!

772
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:46,325
[indistinct chatter]

773
00:56:00,139 --> 00:56:01,340
Think that did it?

774
00:56:03,509 --> 00:56:04,810
Not quite.

775
00:56:10,516 --> 00:56:11,851
Got a possible bomb threat.

776
00:56:11,918 --> 00:56:14,387
Which one is Councilman Stewart's car?

777
00:56:14,453 --> 00:56:15,922
[keys clacking]

778
00:56:15,988 --> 00:56:20,026
It's a BMW, license number 2SAM564.

779
00:56:25,064 --> 00:56:26,666
Excuse me, which way did I go?

780
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,268
Thanks.

781
00:57:01,634 --> 00:57:02,702
That did it.

782
00:57:02,768 --> 00:57:04,904
Always does.

783
00:57:04,971 --> 00:57:07,740
I don't know who they are, and I don't care!

784
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:10,142
I said I want out!

785
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:12,378
Just a moment, Leonard.

786
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:14,380
Tito.

787
00:57:14,447 --> 00:57:15,548
You're fired.

788
00:57:15,614 --> 00:57:16,682
[gunshot]

789
00:57:16,749 --> 00:57:18,351
I'm sorry, you were saying?

790
00:57:18,417 --> 00:57:20,886
I said I want out. I want my goddamn money,

791
00:57:20,953 --> 00:57:22,822
and I want out!

792
00:57:22,888 --> 00:57:24,957
Calm down, Leonard.

793
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:28,194
No, I'm not gonna fucking calm down, Leonard!

794
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,329
You asked me to get Kent the goddamn contract,

795
00:57:30,396 --> 00:57:32,932
and I got him the goddamn contract.

796
00:57:32,999 --> 00:57:36,068
Now, I want my money, and I want out!

797
00:57:37,136 --> 00:57:38,471
All right, Leonard, all right.

798
00:57:38,537 --> 00:57:40,272
Anything you say.

799
00:57:40,339 --> 00:57:41,841
We'll come and get you.

800
00:57:44,343 --> 00:57:47,813
There's nothing worse than a crooked politician.

801
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,049
Bob, the councilman needs a ride.

802
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:03,863
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm.

803
00:58:03,929 --> 00:58:06,966
Couldn't wait to get that raggedy old sweatshirt back on, could you?

804
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,001
Nope.

805
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,741
Know something?

806
00:58:15,808 --> 00:58:18,110
I'm really beginning to enjoy police work.

807
00:58:18,844 --> 00:58:20,713
No, no, really.

808
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,715
I really think I could get into this as an alternative occupation.

809
00:58:23,516 --> 00:58:25,217
It's sorta fun.

810
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:27,820
So, uh, what kind of money you guys make?

811
00:58:27,887 --> 00:58:30,256
Starting pay around $23,000.

812
00:58:30,823 --> 00:58:32,124
A week?

813
00:58:32,658 --> 00:58:34,326
A year.

814
00:58:34,393 --> 00:58:36,295
You let people shoot you for that kind of money?

815
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:38,931
That's right.

816
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:43,903
What kind of money does a brain surgeon make?

817
00:58:51,877 --> 00:58:53,245
Or maybe a gynecologist.

818
00:58:53,312 --> 00:58:55,081
Now, that wouldn't be such a bad job, would it?

819
00:58:55,147 --> 00:58:57,116
Have your nose buried in your work.

820
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:01,854
[tires squealing]

821
00:59:04,423 --> 00:59:05,458
Hey! Hey!

822
00:59:16,769 --> 00:59:17,937
Shit!

823
00:59:18,003 --> 00:59:19,271
[engine revving]

824
00:59:27,012 --> 00:59:28,547
[screaming]

825
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:41,293
Get an ambulance to Hope and Figueroa.

826
00:59:43,262 --> 00:59:43,963
Now!

827
00:59:44,029 --> 00:59:45,397
Hey, look out!

828
00:59:45,464 --> 00:59:46,799
[screaming]

829
00:59:48,534 --> 00:59:50,970
[sirens wailing]

830
00:59:58,911 --> 01:00:00,446
[policeman] Move it, move it! Let's go!

831
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,581
Pull back, please, ma'am.

832
01:00:02,648 --> 01:00:04,016
Please.

833
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:06,285
That's the guy. That's the guy.

834
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,321
He's the one that said there was a bomb threat.

835
01:00:13,259 --> 01:00:15,427
[man] All right. Let's talk to him.

836
01:00:17,163 --> 01:00:19,098
Okay, what's going on?

837
01:00:19,165 --> 01:00:21,600
That's the guy, and there was another one just like him.

838
01:00:26,872 --> 01:00:27,907
Here you are, Peter.

839
01:00:27,973 --> 01:00:29,241
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

840
01:00:40,352 --> 01:00:42,454
What do you mean he got away?

841
01:00:42,521 --> 01:00:44,223
I came back to the car, he was gone.

842
01:00:47,259 --> 01:00:49,261
And where were you when all this was going on?

843
01:00:51,797 --> 01:00:54,867
I was, uh...I...

844
01:00:54,934 --> 01:00:56,802
He was guarding a possible suspect.

845
01:00:56,869 --> 01:01:00,372
The guy with his throat slit. Nice work.

846
01:01:00,439 --> 01:01:02,007
Agent Regan,

847
01:01:02,074 --> 01:01:04,143
you're off the case!

848
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:06,812
Yeah, I kinda figured that.

849
01:01:06,879 --> 01:01:09,381
Put out an APB On Peter Jade.

850
01:01:09,448 --> 01:01:12,151
This was a stupid idea in the first place.

851
01:01:12,685 --> 01:01:13,919
No shit!

852
01:01:15,287 --> 01:01:17,790
Geez, I'm really sorry, Dave.

853
01:01:17,856 --> 01:01:20,392
Don't worry about it, Whitney. There'll be other bad guys.

854
01:01:20,459 --> 01:01:21,961
Come on, I'll give you a ride home.

855
01:01:22,027 --> 01:01:23,729
[Sinclair] Detective Jade!

856
01:01:23,796 --> 01:01:26,599
Here's that report you wanted. You were right.

857
01:01:26,665 --> 01:01:30,736
Chamberlain made some heavy-duty contributions to Stewart's campaign.

858
01:01:30,803 --> 01:01:33,906
I still don't get how Kent Construction ties into this.

859
01:01:35,007 --> 01:01:36,308
Good question.

860
01:01:37,409 --> 01:01:39,245
Thanks, Sinclair, I owe you one.

861
01:01:39,311 --> 01:01:41,247
Then how 'bout buying some cookies?

862
01:01:41,313 --> 01:01:43,882
Oh, yeah! You got any of those mint ones!

863
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:46,051
Sure do!

864
01:01:46,118 --> 01:01:48,187
Son of a bitch stole my wallet!

865
01:01:50,489 --> 01:01:51,757
Detective Jade.

866
01:01:51,824 --> 01:01:53,626
David Jade, here to question one of the prisoners.

867
01:01:55,828 --> 01:01:57,997
Thank you for your cooperation.

868
01:02:03,869 --> 01:02:05,304
[prisoner] Yo, nice sport suit.

869
01:02:34,466 --> 01:02:36,302
Hey, Mr. C, how you doin'?

870
01:02:36,368 --> 01:02:38,103
I'm doing fine, Peter.

871
01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:40,239
Good to see you.

872
01:02:40,306 --> 01:02:43,676
So, what, you miss prison that bad?

873
01:02:43,742 --> 01:02:47,880
No way. I just came to pay homage to the master.

874
01:02:47,946 --> 01:02:51,317
If it wasn't for you, I'd still be boostin' car radios.

875
01:02:51,383 --> 01:02:53,252
You taught me everything I know.

876
01:02:53,319 --> 01:02:55,187
Except how to bullshit.

877
01:02:55,254 --> 01:02:57,589
And you, Peter, are the master of that.

878
01:02:59,091 --> 01:03:00,426
So what's goin' on?

879
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:08,500
Where'd you get that?

880
01:03:08,567 --> 01:03:10,469
Uh, I found it.

881
01:03:11,503 --> 01:03:13,339
Now can you tell me what I found?

882
01:03:13,939 --> 01:03:16,275
Depository card.

883
01:03:16,342 --> 01:03:18,777
It accesses a Hymrick polycast vault.

884
01:03:21,213 --> 01:03:24,083
A beautiful, beautiful tomb.

885
01:03:24,149 --> 01:03:26,251
Only three of them ever made.

886
01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:28,354
One for the French Consulate in Washington,

887
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,689
and one for the late, great Shah of Iran.

888
01:03:30,756 --> 01:03:34,693
And the last, right here, in sunny Southern California

889
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,462
at the IDE.

890
01:03:36,528 --> 01:03:38,664
International Diamond Exchange.

891
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:39,865
Yep.

892
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:41,900
On any given day,

893
01:03:41,967 --> 01:03:44,403
that little card will get you,

894
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:48,040
maybe $5 billion in diamonds.

895
01:03:48,107 --> 01:03:49,742
Billion, with a "B"!

896
01:03:52,044 --> 01:03:53,479
[chuckling] Hang on, Peter.

897
01:03:54,313 --> 01:03:56,181
Don't come too quick.

898
01:03:56,248 --> 01:03:58,150
It's not gonna do you any good.

899
01:03:58,550 --> 01:03:59,685
Why not?

900
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,353
Well, think about it,

901
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,822
Diamonds are an international currency.

902
01:04:03,889 --> 01:04:07,126
So in that exchange you got fellas from

903
01:04:07,192 --> 01:04:10,629
Japan, India, South Africa.

904
01:04:10,696 --> 01:04:13,232
Thirty-five board members from all over the world.

905
01:04:13,298 --> 01:04:15,768
Each one of them's got a card like that.

906
01:04:15,834 --> 01:04:19,338
Now, just suppose that some muscle-bound idiot

907
01:04:19,405 --> 01:04:22,374
happens to find one of those cards?

908
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,778
What's to prevent him from just walking in there and cleaning the place out?

909
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:28,313
Another vault.

910
01:04:30,315 --> 01:04:32,351
You always were my best student.

911
01:04:32,418 --> 01:04:35,220
Yeah, Hyler is sittin' pretty

912
01:04:35,287 --> 01:04:37,623
behind 16 feet of concrete and steel

913
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,392
with a magnetic time lock

914
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:42,194
set to open only during business hours

915
01:04:42,261 --> 01:04:44,897
with plenty of armed guards around.

916
01:04:44,963 --> 01:04:46,598
Keep the undesirables away.

917
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,701
Like you and me.

918
01:04:50,602 --> 01:04:51,870
No way.

919
01:04:51,937 --> 01:04:54,473
If you were accidentally locked inside,

920
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:57,176
it would take a construction crew half the night

921
01:04:57,242 --> 01:04:58,877
to blast you out.

922
01:04:58,944 --> 01:05:01,747
You might as well try to break into Fort Knox.

923
01:05:04,116 --> 01:05:05,517
Did you say a construction crew?

924
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:19,264
Miller time!

925
01:05:53,398 --> 01:05:54,633
[Chamberlain] Thank you.

926
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,302
You've made my life so much easier.

927
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:04,343
[cracking]

928
01:06:07,112 --> 01:06:08,480
If you'll give me the card back,

929
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:10,516
I'll let you keep all the diamonds,

930
01:06:10,582 --> 01:06:12,584
which you also stole from me.

931
01:06:15,087 --> 01:06:16,655
You got the wrong guy.

932
01:06:20,359 --> 01:06:21,560
Isn't this you?

933
01:06:23,328 --> 01:06:24,897
That's my twin brother.

934
01:06:24,963 --> 01:06:26,798
[chuckling]

935
01:06:26,865 --> 01:06:30,736
I like that. [chuckles] Humor in the face of adversity.

936
01:06:30,802 --> 01:06:31,703
I like that.

937
01:06:32,538 --> 01:06:33,639
Bob.

938
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:39,611
Ever since I was a child,

939
01:06:39,678 --> 01:06:42,147
I've always gotten exactly what I wanted.

940
01:06:42,214 --> 01:06:43,715
Yet one way or another,

941
01:06:43,782 --> 01:06:46,518
things always seem to end up in my favor.

942
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:49,855
At this point,

943
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:52,858
I do not know how I would react to being disappointed.

944
01:06:55,894 --> 01:06:56,795
Bob.

945
01:07:00,032 --> 01:07:01,500
Either you are going to run out of blood,

946
01:07:01,567 --> 01:07:03,802
Or I am going to run out of patience.

947
01:07:04,503 --> 01:07:06,438
Or maybe both.

948
01:07:06,505 --> 01:07:09,474
I don't know. Where's the card?

949
01:07:12,244 --> 01:07:13,979
You got the wrong guy.

950
01:07:14,813 --> 01:07:16,214
Oh, fuck it.

951
01:07:16,281 --> 01:07:18,750
This is becoming a bore.

952
01:07:20,152 --> 01:07:21,386
[Peter] Freeze.

953
01:07:22,688 --> 01:07:23,622
Drop it.

954
01:07:28,527 --> 01:07:31,163
It looks like I owe you an apology.

955
01:07:31,229 --> 01:07:33,098
I said drop it.

956
01:07:33,165 --> 01:07:34,733
No.

957
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,335
[gun cocks]

958
01:07:36,401 --> 01:07:37,703
You drop it.

959
01:07:41,406 --> 01:07:42,908
Kill him.

960
01:07:55,687 --> 01:07:56,955
Got it.

961
01:07:57,022 --> 01:07:57,990
Good.

962
01:07:59,925 --> 01:08:01,326
Now I'm happy again.

963
01:08:16,475 --> 01:08:18,644
What about the rest of the money?

964
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:21,179
Oh, leave it. It's still traceable.

965
01:08:21,246 --> 01:08:24,416
Besides, we don't need it anymore.

966
01:08:24,483 --> 01:08:27,219
Getting out of the money-laundering business?

967
01:08:27,285 --> 01:08:29,087
It's served its purpose.

968
01:08:29,154 --> 01:08:31,657
Like financing a hit on the diamond exchange?

969
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:33,825
Ooh...

970
01:08:33,892 --> 01:08:36,428
And who said bodybuilders were big and dumb?

971
01:08:37,162 --> 01:08:38,296
[door slams]

972
01:08:38,363 --> 01:08:39,531
We're ready.

973
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:41,733
Ah.

974
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,235
Mr. Kent.

975
01:08:43,301 --> 01:08:44,403
[chuckles]

976
01:08:44,469 --> 01:08:45,904
Here is the card.

977
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:48,006
Please.

978
01:08:48,073 --> 01:08:48,940
Don't lose it.

979
01:08:51,743 --> 01:08:53,879
Jeremy? Get the plane ready.

980
01:08:53,945 --> 01:08:57,382
Gentlemen, I want to thank you for making this

981
01:08:57,449 --> 01:08:59,584
a most memorable day.

982
01:09:00,986 --> 01:09:01,987
Bob.

983
01:09:03,522 --> 01:09:06,358
Let's... go for a ride.

984
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:13,298
I can tell you're mad at me.

985
01:09:13,365 --> 01:09:16,435
Come on, Dave, I don't wanna die knowing you're mad at me.

986
01:09:16,501 --> 01:09:18,136
Why'd you run away?

987
01:09:18,203 --> 01:09:19,971
They were after me. I didn't want to get you killed.

988
01:09:20,038 --> 01:09:22,240
Thanks a lot. That was very considerate of you.

989
01:09:22,307 --> 01:09:25,210
Okay. Well, then, maybe I was just getting sick and tired of saving your ass!

990
01:09:25,277 --> 01:09:26,978
Do me a favor, shoot me first,

991
01:09:27,045 --> 01:09:29,214
so I don't have to listen to this idiot anymore.

992
01:09:29,281 --> 01:09:30,549
Unbelievable.

993
01:09:30,615 --> 01:09:31,983
-Who you callin' an idiot? -Don't shove me.

994
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:33,685
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do about it?

995
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:35,087
I'll show you, what I'm gonna do about it.

996
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:18,029
Ooh!

997
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:26,938
[grunts in pain]

998
01:10:40,352 --> 01:10:41,520
Love my job.

999
01:10:41,586 --> 01:10:42,921
[gun cocks]

1000
01:10:43,622 --> 01:10:46,091
[screams] No!

1001
01:10:51,563 --> 01:10:52,631
Whitney!

1002
01:10:58,470 --> 01:11:00,539
You all right? I got tired of waiting in the car.

1003
01:11:00,605 --> 01:11:02,941
Yeah, I'm all right. Thanks.

1004
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:05,143
Whitney, you are awesome, man!

1005
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:06,378
Thanks, Peter.

1006
01:11:06,444 --> 01:11:08,313
Listen, you better call the feds.

1007
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:09,815
Tell them to get their asses down to the diamond exchange, pronto.

1008
01:11:10,382 --> 01:11:11,750
Right on!

1009
01:11:19,291 --> 01:11:20,392
What a dick.

1010
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:21,726
Really.

1011
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,109
[siren wailing]

1012
01:12:03,101 --> 01:12:05,670
This is unit 4. We are in place at the rear of the building.

1013
01:12:09,107 --> 01:12:11,009
[man over radio] Unit 2, the roof is secure.

1014
01:12:14,613 --> 01:12:17,215
This is unit 1. We've got it tied up out front.

1015
01:12:17,282 --> 01:12:19,784
There's no way they're gonna get in here.

1016
01:12:19,851 --> 01:12:21,319
I own this building.

1017
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:27,259
[tires squealing]

1018
01:12:28,894 --> 01:12:30,795
Come on, man. Take it easy, will ya?

1019
01:12:30,862 --> 01:12:32,931
I wanna be alive when they pin the medal on me.

1020
01:12:37,535 --> 01:12:38,803
Check it out.

1021
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:40,105
Approved, metro rail committee chairman

1022
01:12:40,171 --> 01:12:42,040
fourth district city councilman,

1023
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:44,142
Leonard Stewart.

1024
01:12:44,209 --> 01:12:46,278
He was in on the take from Chamberlain, too.

1025
01:12:47,546 --> 01:12:48,914
Oh, my God. Kent Construction's

1026
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:51,216
building the downtown section of the metro rail.

1027
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:53,018
Remind me not to ride it.

1028
01:12:53,084 --> 01:12:56,121
Dave, the metro rail runs right under the diamond exchange.

1029
01:12:57,756 --> 01:12:59,624
[tires squealing]

1030
01:13:52,077 --> 01:13:53,778
Media's here. They want a statement.

1031
01:13:53,845 --> 01:13:55,847
-Which media? -Local TV and papers.

1032
01:13:55,914 --> 01:13:57,816
-Anybody from the networks? -No.

1033
01:13:58,650 --> 01:13:59,884
Make 'em wait.

1034
01:14:49,534 --> 01:14:50,802
Jones!

1035
01:14:52,437 --> 01:14:53,471
Bring me some decaf.

1036
01:15:36,614 --> 01:15:38,049
[beeping]

1037
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:54,232
We're in.

1038
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,801
[man] Copy that.

1039
01:15:56,868 --> 01:15:58,002
All clear top side.

1040
01:16:51,489 --> 01:16:52,957
That's it. Comin' out.

1041
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:55,927
Top side, do you copy?

1042
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:11,576
Go!

1043
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:57,522
[cork pops]

1044
01:18:00,658 --> 01:18:01,960
There...

1045
01:18:06,397 --> 01:18:07,365
Gentlemen...

1046
01:18:08,066 --> 01:18:09,434
May I propose a toast?

1047
01:18:10,568 --> 01:18:11,936
First of all,

1048
01:18:12,003 --> 01:18:15,673
to those of us who were unable to make the party tonight,

1049
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:18,009
to Bob and the others who...

1050
01:18:19,911 --> 01:18:21,512
I don't give a shit about anyway.

1051
01:18:21,579 --> 01:18:22,947
[chuckling]

1052
01:18:23,014 --> 01:18:25,883
[laughing]

1053
01:18:25,950 --> 01:18:27,986
The less the merrier, huh?

1054
01:18:28,853 --> 01:18:30,255
Yeah. And, secondly,

1055
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:31,522
and most importantly,

1056
01:18:31,589 --> 01:18:34,225
to the most brilliantly conceived

1057
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:36,427
and successful rip-off

1058
01:18:36,494 --> 01:18:38,997
since the invention of junk bonds.

1059
01:18:39,897 --> 01:18:42,634
Gentlemen, I thank you.

1060
01:18:51,542 --> 01:18:53,044
[coughing]

1061
01:18:53,111 --> 01:18:54,646
[glasses shattering]

1062
01:18:57,582 --> 01:18:58,950
Ooh.

1063
01:19:01,619 --> 01:19:04,656
Oh, golly, of course, Mr. Kent, I forgot.

1064
01:19:04,722 --> 01:19:05,957
You don't drink.

1065
01:19:40,291 --> 01:19:42,527
[Dave] Your flight's been canceled.

1066
01:19:42,593 --> 01:19:43,695
[gun cocks]

1067
01:19:46,664 --> 01:19:48,433
Gentlemen!

1068
01:19:48,499 --> 01:19:50,902
Ha! There's enough here to make everyone

1069
01:19:50,968 --> 01:19:52,770
forgive and forget.

1070
01:19:52,837 --> 01:19:55,239
Enough to forgive you for killing my partner?

1071
01:20:01,746 --> 01:20:03,114
Forget it.

1072
01:20:05,283 --> 01:20:08,152
You certainly should be able to appreciate my offer.

1073
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,221
Look at them...

1074
01:20:12,123 --> 01:20:13,291
Breathe...

1075
01:20:14,659 --> 01:20:15,793
It's like they're alive.

1076
01:20:17,695 --> 01:20:20,531
They don't really reflect light...

1077
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:24,702
It seems to emanate from them.

1078
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:28,206
They sparkle...

1079
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:33,111
With dreams... With power.

1080
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:41,786
You forgot to say, "you're getting drowsy."

1081
01:20:44,255 --> 01:20:46,824
You know what? You're as dumb as I look.

1082
01:20:49,227 --> 01:20:50,728
Book 'em, Davo.

1083
01:21:00,872 --> 01:21:02,640
Peter, you all right?

1084
01:21:02,707 --> 01:21:05,143
No, I'm not all right. I'm shot!

1085
01:21:05,209 --> 01:21:06,511
He shot me!

1086
01:21:08,046 --> 01:21:09,380
Hey, Peter...

1087
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:11,449
What?

1088
01:21:11,516 --> 01:21:13,184
I'm not mad at you anymore.

1089
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:18,222
Dave, go kick some butt.

1090
01:22:47,345 --> 01:22:49,180
[sighs]

1091
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,535
Peter?

1092
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:21,712
Peter!

1093
01:23:23,181 --> 01:23:24,715
Peter!

1094
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:30,655
Peter!

1095
01:23:32,023 --> 01:23:32,990
Peter!
