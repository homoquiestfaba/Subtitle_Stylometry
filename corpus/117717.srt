1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:00,042
23.976

2
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:45,420
All forgotten... yesterdays

3
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:50,300
School days remind me of

4
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:55,430
When I was a boy

5
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,058
All my life

6
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:02,604
I've been this lonely boy

7
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,065
Doo doo

8
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,549
- The gate!

9
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,037
What do you want?

10
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:09,082
- Can I use the bathroom here?
- I can't let you back in here.

11
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,293
This is the discharge gate.

12
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,837
Hey, there's the last bus
into town tonight.

13
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,839
You better get on it.

14
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,558
Excuse me. You know where
the bathroom is?

15
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,560
Yeah, it's down there.

16
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:01,695
The bathroom's closed, sir.
It's closed! Thanks.

17
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,159
Excuse me, miss?

18
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,912
- Do you know where there's a bathroom?
- It's back there.

19
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,914
That's closed.
Do you know another bathroom?

20
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,916
There's one in the restaurant,
up there.

21
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,168
- Okay, thanks. Thank you.
- Down there.

22
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,010
Fuck, man.

23
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,836
Restaurant is closed.

24
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,338
- Restaurant is closed.
- Can I use the bathroom?

25
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,466
Bathroom is closed, too.
I said, the restaurant is closed.

26
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,193
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

27
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,862
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

28
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,157
And-a-one, two, three, four,
stand-up-straight, seven, eight.

29
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,619
Stamp down, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

30
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:16,872
Stamp-don't-bend-over, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

31
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:20,042
Stamp-and-smile, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

32
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,420
Stamp-toe-heel, and one, two,
three and four.

33
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:25,964
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

34
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,383
Again, two, three,
five, six, seven, eight.

35
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,094
Repeat, two, two, two,
five, six, seven, eight.

36
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,181
And stamp, and-a-one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

37
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:37,142
And stamp, then smile, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

38
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:40,854
Stamp, then-a-one, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, and doubles!

39
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:44,149
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

40
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,946
- What the fuck you lookin' at?
- Nothin'.

41
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,157
- Get your fuckin' face outta my pants.
- Relax!

42
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,910
Don't tell me to relax.
Don't tell me to fuckin' relax!

43
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:57,454
Just keep your face
outta my pants.

44
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,456
- Just so big!
- What the fuck did you say?

45
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,001
What the fuck did you say?
What did you say to me, you faggot?

46
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,420
Get the fuck
outta the bathroom.

47
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,422
Get the fuck
outta the bathroom, faggot!

48
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,424
Damn it!

49
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:13,679
I can't piss. That fuck, fag.

50
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,681
Fuck!
I'll kill that fucker!

51
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,184
Fuckin' faggot!
Faggots!

52
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,272
- Watch your mouth.
- What? What?

53
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,732
Why don't you watch
your mouth?

54
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,776
Smart-ass!

55
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,947
- Hey, miss. Miss!
- What?

56
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,991
- You got a quarter I can borrow?
- Yes.

57
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,993
- Can I borrow it?
- Yeah.

58
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,121
Can I borrow it now?

59
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,922
- Don't you say, "Thanks"?
- What?

60
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,008
- Don't you say, "Thank you"?
- What?

61
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,650
Hello, Ma?

62
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:13,655
It's me.
It's Billy.

63
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,657
Billy.

64
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,368
Billy, your son!
Turn down the TV, Ma.

65
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,370
Turn down the television!

66
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,372
It's Billy.

67
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,044
I told you we were gonna be
in town for one day, right?

68
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,046
Well, we're in town.
We just flew in.

69
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,635
We're at
the fancy hotel, Ma.

70
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,137
I told you we were
staying downtown. Yes.

71
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,515
The big hotel. Right.

72
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:46,021
Yeah, I have a big room.
Yes, it's beautiful here.

73
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,358
Yes, it's clean, Ma.

74
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,402
It's a very expensive hotel,
okay?

75
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,241
No, don't come here, Ma.
Don't come here.

76
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,243
I told you
I wanna go there.

77
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:02,287
I wanna see
the old neighborhood.

78
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,541
I wanna come now.

79
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,252
What time is the game over, Ma?

80
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,254
Fine.

81
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:13,215
I'll come at 5:00.

82
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,217
No, Ma. She's not coming.
She's sick.

83
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,219
I don't know, Ma.

84
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,221
People get sick.
I don't know why she's sick.

85
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:23,225
She's sick. Every time we fly
on planes, she gets sick.

86
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,227
I don't know why.

87
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,688
She doesn't like flying.
Plus, we sit in first class.

88
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,815
They bring you a lot of food,
and she always gets stomach cramps.

89
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,484
I don't know.

90
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,737
I ca...
She's sleeping, Ma.

91
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,990
I'm in the lobby
of the hotel.

92
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,409
She's sleeping upstairs.
I'm not gonna wake her up.

93
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,746
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear what I said?

94
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:49,001
What did I say?
What did I say? She's sick!

95
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:52,004
Fine, Ma.
You want me to wake her up?

96
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:56,008
You want me to go upstairs and wake
her up? You know, you're unbelievable.

97
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,802
Then how you gonna feel
when she comes over sick?

98
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:02,806
How you gonna feel then,
when you see how sick she is?

99
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,808
No, I'm gonna bring her.

100
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,810
I'm gonna drag her outta bed,
and I'm gonna bring her.

101
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:10,230
So you can see her.
Fine. We're coming over.

102
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,232
We're coming over.

103
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:16,195
I said I'm bringing her.
Yes. Fine.

104
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,197
Okay? Good-bye.

105
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,958
Excuse me, miss?

106
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:37,549
- Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!

107
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:39,343
Shut up, shut up.

108
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,428
Don't you scream,
or I'll take a bite outta your face.

109
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:45,390
All right?
Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth.

110
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,102
Shut your mouth.
Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth.

111
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,648
Come on.
Come on.

112
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,775
Two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

113
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,153
And again. One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

114
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:01,990
Shut your mouth,
and you'll be okay.

115
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,203
Point your car out.

116
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:11,375
Give me your fuckin' purse.

117
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,212
Just shut up.
Shut up!

118
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:20,425
- Ow. You're hurting me.
- Yeah? Shut your mouth, or I'll really hurt you.

119
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,803
Wanna really get hurt?
Get in the car.

120
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,805
Get in. Hurry up!

121
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,807
Get in the car.

122
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,809
How do I get
this thing back?

123
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:32,187
- Point to the thing!
- It's right there.

124
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,189
All right.

125
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,693
I can't see
out the window.

126
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,695
Give me something
to wipe the window with.

127
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,738
Give me something
to wipe the window with!

128
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,241
Okay, no, you go out.
You clean it.

129
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,702
Get outta the car
and clean this window.

130
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,996
Don't you ever clean
your window?

131
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,998
Do you ever think
about cleaning your car?

132
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,166
I don't got all day.
Hurry up!

133
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,502
See how you wash
your car?

134
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,504
You see how nice,
when a car's clean?

135
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:01,216
Come here. Is that how
your house is, filthy like that?

136
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,218
You see how nice the car is
when it's clean?

137
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,220
Now you can see.
That's good.

138
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:08,390
That's good. Get in your car.
Come on. Hurry up.

139
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,392
- Hurry up!
- Stop!

140
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,394
You shut your mouth!
Shut your mouth.

141
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,688
Filthy.
Filthy.

142
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,612
All right.
Where's the thing on this car?

143
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,906
- How do you put it in gear? Where's the thing?
- It's right here.

144
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,242
What is this?
Is this a shifter car?

145
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,244
I cannot drive
a shifter car.

146
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:31,288
So we got
a situation here.

147
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,374
I can't drive these kinda cars.
What the fuck is goin' on?

148
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,377
You think that's funny?
Would you like to know, smart-ass?

149
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,255
Would you like to know why
I can't drive this kinda car?

150
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,257
I'm used to luxury cars.

151
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,593
Have you ever heard
of a luxury car?

152
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:48,430
Ever heard of Cadillac, Cadillac
Eldorado? That's what I drive.

153
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,766
I drive cars
that shift themselves.

154
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,353
My cars shift themselves.
The luxury cars, they shift themselves.

155
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,813
So when I say, "Three",
you follow my count.

156
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,815
You come around to my door,
got me?

157
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:03,153
One, two, three.

158
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:06,198
What'd I just say?
One, two, three.

159
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,367
Get outta the car.
Get outta the car.

160
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,912
I'm watching you.
I'm watching you.

161
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:15,958
I'm watching you, and don't make
that face. Don't make that face.

162
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,960
Hurry up!

163
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,675
Now, pull away.

164
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,681
Go this way. Hey, go this way!
This way!

165
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,321
- I want you to pull over up there.
- Where?

166
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:49,825
Pull over here!
Right here. That's it.

167
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,827
That's good. That's it.
Beautiful.

168
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,373
Put the car in park,
all right?

169
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,003
I'm gonna step outta
the car for one minute.

170
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,005
Put your hands
on the dashboard.

171
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,007
Hold them like that.

172
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,134
Don't let me see
you move one finger.

173
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,887
Not one twitch or I'll come back.
I'll choke you to death.

174
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:13,223
I'll take a bite outta your cheek,
and I'll shit you out.

175
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:15,225
So just hold your hands
like that.

176
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,352
You understand me?
Nod your head if you understand.

177
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:19,813
You understand?
Yes. Yes. You understand.

178
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,357
All right.
Stay right there.

179
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:47,633
Oh.

180
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,887
Don't look.

181
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,098
Oh.

182
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,900
Who told you to look?

183
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,658
Oh. Oh!

184
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,409
Oh!

185
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:17,663
Take your hands
off the dash.

186
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,665
You're makin' me nervous.

187
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,262
First thing.
Right off the bat.

188
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,264
I'd like to apologize.

189
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,474
All right?
I'm gonna apologize.

190
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,894
I've had to go to the bathroom
for hours. I've been backed up.

191
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,772
Totally backed up.

192
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,483
Anyway, I swear to God,
I didn't mean to scare you.

193
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,194
I'm sorry if I pulled your hair,
all right?

194
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:53,282
You okay, huh?
Good.

195
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:57,744
All right. Now don't talk,
all right? Please.

196
00:17:57,828 --> 00:18:00,330
I need to ask you
a favor.

197
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,333
I haven't seen my parents
in a long time, right?

198
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,919
'Cause I just got out
of jail.

199
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:09,006
I was innocent.

200
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:13,093
Okay. Before I went away,
I made up a few lies.

201
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:17,431
I said I was married. I also told them
I worked for the government...

202
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,350
and that I would be away
for a long time.

203
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:23,020
Now, what I need you to do,
is I need you to come...

204
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,189
to my parent's house
with me, all right?

205
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,191
And pretend
to be my wife.

206
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:30,652
Acting, all right?
Today's your big debut. Your big break.

207
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,654
This is acting, all right?
You're my wife.

208
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:37,117
So, that means you adore me,
you love me, you cherish me.

209
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,037
Jesus Christ,
you can't live without me.

210
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:43,332
Now, the story will go
like this.

211
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,376
We met in high school,
and, uh,

212
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,378
we were sweethearts,
whatever.

213
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:51,965
You loved me. You've been
in love with me your whole life.

214
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,551
Your new name would be
Wendy Balsam.

215
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,553
All right?
Don't worry about the details.

216
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,555
I'll take over.
Just be nice.

217
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:03,060
When you get there,
be a decent girl. Be nice.

218
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:06,355
Um, what's your name?
What's your real name?

219
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:11,777
- Layla.
- Layla. No. That's no good.

220
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,071
We'll stick with Wendy Balsam,
okay? You're Wendy Balsam.

221
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,448
So, basically,
what I'm asking you to do,

222
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:18,450
is I'm asking you
to come there...

223
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,452
and make me look good,
all right?

224
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:22,496
If you make
a fool outta me,

225
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,499
I swear to God,
I'll kill you right there.

226
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:29,378
Boom. Right in front
of Mommy and Daddy.

227
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,797
I'll tell you something else.
If you make me look bad,

228
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,509
I will never, ever,
talk to you again.

229
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:37,511
Ever.

230
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:40,681
But if you do a good job,
well, then you could be my best friend.

231
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,225
My best friend
that I've ever had.

232
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,769
Hear me?

233
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,689
All right.
Let's keep driving.

234
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,066
All right? We're gonna go.
Keep driving.

235
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,110
What's your name?

236
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,237
My name is Billy.

237
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,614
Billy Brown.

238
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:06,248
Just remember
why you're there.

239
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,711
You're there to make me look good.
You hear me?

240
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:14,631
You can eat all the food you want,
but just make me look good.

241
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:17,926
- Okay? Why are you there?
- To make you look good.

242
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:20,095
That's right.
To make me look good.

243
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,639
- Then you can go home.
- Okay.

244
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,641
Are your parents
vegetarians?

245
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,436
I hope so, 'cause
I don't eat meat.

246
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,438
Ever.

247
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,375
Come on.
Come on.

248
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,144
- Which house is it?
- It's there.

249
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,701
All right, all right!

250
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:28,455
Ohh! Ohh!
Oh, goddamn it. Ohh!

251
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:32,459
Oh, honey, did you see that?
- Oh. Oh, man.

252
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,461
Did you see that?

253
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,463
Oh, I can't believe it.

254
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:38,382
Are you okay?

255
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,384
What'd I tell you?
All right?

256
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,719
Just make sure
you behave right.

257
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,268
Come on.
Come on!

258
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,395
What'd I tell you?
Come on.

259
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,397
- Don't start.
- All right. Just come on.

260
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,399
- Do me this favor, all right?
- I will.

261
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,402
This is not,
uh, nice, okay?

262
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,989
Just be nice, okay?
Be nice.

263
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:05,284
Say hello,
really nice hellos.

264
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,286
- My father likes when people say hello.
- Okay.

265
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,080
Okay. Hello, Mr. Brown.
Okay, please.

266
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,165
Okay.

267
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,881
Are you sure you're okay?

268
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,885
I feel sick.

269
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,306
I feel like throwing up.

270
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:36,064
- Would you hold me a second?
- Tackle him!

271
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:38,025
- Tackle him!
- Would you hold me?

272
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:40,027
- Tackle him!
- Don't touch me.

273
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,572
- I can't believe you!
- Don't touch me.

274
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:45,616
- You're so pathetic!
- Come on. Come on.

275
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,827
- Get off the street. Get off the street!
- Come on.

276
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:53,832
All right, all right!

277
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,834
Get him! Run, run!

278
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:58,420
- Hello!

279
00:22:58,504 --> 00:23:02,174
You, you, you, you, you! Whew!

280
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:07,429
Hey, Dad.

281
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,517
Jan, it's your son.

282
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:13,519
Who?

283
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,521
I said, it's your son.

284
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:19,691
Oh, honey.

285
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:23,445
It's Billy.
Billy's here.

286
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,678
- So, we're so happy to meet you, honey.

287
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,680
Billy's told us
so much about you.

288
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:53,183
Oh, well, I've heard so much
about both of you.

289
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:56,061
He's very proud
of you two.

290
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,063
Do you think I could use
your bathroom?

291
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:01,692
Sure, honey. Billy, go show her
where the bathroom is.

292
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:06,154
It's down the hall.
Don't take a long time.

293
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:08,198
I have to go
to the bathroom.

294
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,200
Just hurry up.

295
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:19,626
So, honey. You look tired.
Are you sick?

296
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,129
No, I'm not sick, Ma.

297
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,341
Why?

298
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:30,429
Well, you just...
look so tired.

299
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:34,016
I am a little tired.
I just flew on a plane. Okay?

300
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,560
All right, honey.
Don't get upset.

301
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,938
- I'm not upset.
- All right.

302
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:45,027
- You want something to drink?
- Yeah.

303
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:48,030
All right. What do you want
to drink, honey?

304
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,324
I'd like a glass
of water, please.

305
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:54,161
Honey, you don't want
some pop?

306
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:56,246
You know
I don't drink pop, Ma.

307
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,957
The bubbles bother
my stomach.

308
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:01,960
Would you like some ginger ale, honey?
I got some ginger ale.

309
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:04,213
- That's good for the stomach.
- Yeah.

310
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:06,632
Ginger ale is pop, Ma.

311
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:09,635
Ginger ale is pop.
I just said I don't want pop.

312
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,553
Can I please have
a glass of water?

313
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:13,555
Oh, how about
I make you the juice?

314
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,766
I got the frozen juice.

315
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,560
I just want a glass
of water, please. Okay?

316
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:20,562
Just a glass of water.
That's all I want.

317
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:23,273
- All right.
- Okay? Thank you.

318
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:31,573
Oh, honey, I got those
chocolate doughnuts you like.

319
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:33,575
You want one now?

320
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,953
You think it'll spoil
your appetite?

321
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:38,747
It won't spoil my appetite, Ma.
I don't eat chocolate.

322
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,791
I'm allergic to it,
remember?

323
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,213
Honey, what are you talking about,
you don't eat chocolate?

324
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,215
You always ate chocolate.

325
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,217
That's great, Ma.
That's great.

326
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,219
You don't remember
your own son. Great.

327
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:55,222
- Ma, my face is itchy.
- I'm allergic to chocolate.

328
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:57,224
When I eat chocolate,
my face blows up.

329
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,226
Honey, what happened
to your face?

330
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:02,896
It's all swollen.
You better put some ice on that.

331
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,898
When I ate chocolate as a kid,

332
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:08,902
you had to take me to the emergency
room, because my face swelled up.

333
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,322
Honey, I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

334
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,324
You always ate chocolate.

335
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:16,326
I didn't eat chocolate, Ma.

336
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,288
I did not always eat chocolate, okay?
I didn't eat chocolate!

337
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:21,290
Can we talk about
something else?

338
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,834
- All right. Just calm down.
- Fine.

339
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,713
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

340
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:30,799
Wood can still go.

341
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:34,428
That has come on in the last few years.
He's one of the best.

342
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:37,055
First and ten, Buffalo.

343
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,228
Why don't you get her
something to drink, Ma?

344
00:26:43,312 --> 00:26:47,316
Ooh! All right.
You want something to drink, honey?

345
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,318
Yeah, could you make me
a rum and Coke?

346
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:51,320
What, honey?

347
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,322
I meant, could I have
a ginger ale?

348
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:56,116
Oh, sure, we got
a ginger ale. Hold on.

349
00:26:57,492 --> 00:27:01,455
Come here, honey.
Let me hug my new little daughter.

350
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:04,416
Daddy loves you, you know that?
Daddy really loves you.

351
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:07,085
His new, little,
sweet, young daughter.

352
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:09,087
Sit down, honey.

353
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,261
I'm 28.

354
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:18,263
Oh, honey.
You look like a baby.

355
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:22,476
- You look so young and pretty.
- Thank you.

356
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,521
My son used to be
a beautiful baby.

357
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:29,233
Oh, you should have seen him.
He was so beautiful.

358
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:34,446
Look at him now.

359
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,199
Oh, no.

360
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:40,244
I think Billy is the most handsome guy
in the whole world.

361
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:42,955
- Who, honey?
- Billy.

362
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,041
I think he's the most handsome man
I've ever seen.

363
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:50,212
- Billy, who?
- This Billy.

364
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,381
Oh? Aah.

365
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:55,551
I can't stand it
when he grows his hair long.

366
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,182
Mrs. Brown, could I see some pictures
of Billy from when he was little?

367
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:04,309
You wanna see pictures?
Sure.

368
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:06,436
Honey, where's
the Billy picture?

369
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,439
- I don't know.
- You know.

370
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,441
The picture of Billy, honey.

371
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:13,610
I don't know where it is.
Uh, wait a minute.

372
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:16,738
We got some pictures, here.

373
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,742
You don't want to forget
how tough it was for Buffalo.

374
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,120
Here's a picture
of me with Jack Kemp.

375
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:28,292
Here's O.J. Simpson.

376
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,004
Here's me with
the Buffalo Bills' caterer.

377
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,718
Oh, here's my husband.

378
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,554
Here's our wedding.

379
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:43,140
Honey, did you find it?

380
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:47,352
Yeah, I found it.

381
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:51,607
Oh, look at Billy.

382
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,651
Oh, he's so cute.

383
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:58,947
Oh, and the puppy. That puppy's
adorable. Whose puppy is that?

384
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:01,909
That was Billy's.
Bingo.

385
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:03,911
What happened to him?

386
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:05,913
I don't know
what happened to him.

387
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:08,707
Um, he ran away.
Yeah, he ran away.

388
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,835
Such a cute puppy.

389
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,962
Billy!

390
00:29:14,046 --> 00:29:16,048
What did I tell you
about this thing?

391
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,342
Didn't I warn you
about this dog?

392
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:21,261
Didn't I tell you if it peed
in the house again, what I'd do?

393
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:23,722
- No, Daddy, please, no!
- Didn't I tell you what I'd do?

394
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,766
- No, Daddy, please!

395
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:32,022
That's enough with the pictures.
I'm hungry.

396
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:34,399
Jan, would you
hurry it up, please?

397
00:29:34,483 --> 00:29:37,402
Oh, who's this handsome guy
in this picture?

398
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:40,405
Oh.
That's me. I was a singer.

399
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:44,493
That's me in a downtown nightclub
with this band.

400
00:29:44,535 --> 00:29:46,495
You know,
Sinatra sang in that club.

401
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:48,497
He sang
in that actual club.

402
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,499
Wow, you're a singer?

403
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:55,003
Well, I was a singer.
Yeah.

404
00:29:55,087 --> 00:29:57,047
Did you ever make
any records?

405
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:59,967
- I mean, do you have any tapes?
- No, no, no.

406
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,386
Well, a few tapes, yeah.

407
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:05,389
- Can I hear one?
- You wanna hear one of my tapes?

408
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:09,184
All right. As soon as we eat,
I'll play you a tape.

409
00:30:09,268 --> 00:30:12,437
Honey, it's gonna be 20 minutes
before I'm done with dinner.

410
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,606
Why don't you play her
the tapes now?

411
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:20,320
- You really want to hear this?
- Yes.

412
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:22,322
Okay. Follow me.

413
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:32,749
Wood's kick is up,
and, of course, it's good.

414
00:30:41,884 --> 00:30:45,846
Now, these are some arrangements
Nelson Riddle made...

415
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:48,223
for Frank, you know,
without Frank's voice, of course,

416
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:51,059
so he could listen to them, see what
he liked, what he didn't like.

417
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:55,230
I like to sing to them.

418
00:30:55,314 --> 00:30:58,150
So, let me find
the hole here.

419
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:03,363
- I hope I can still get up there.

420
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:06,366
Hut, hut.

421
00:31:11,622 --> 00:31:15,709
Fools rush in!

422
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:21,507
Where angels fear
to tread!

423
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:27,429
And so I come to you
my love!

424
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:31,266
My heart
above my head!

425
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,732
Though I see!

426
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:42,736
The danger there!

427
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:50,244
If there's
a chance for me!

428
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:55,582
Then I don't care!

429
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:02,214
Fools rush in!

430
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:07,052
Where wise men
never go!

431
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:14,142
But wise men
never fall in love!

432
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:18,313
So how are they
to know!

433
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:26,029
When we met!

434
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:31,994
I felt
my life begin!

435
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:37,833
So open up
your heart and let!

436
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:43,422
This fool rush in!

437
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:59,229
So, we have Buffalo take the fall...

438
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:04,193
after being stuck by a 58-yard
touchdown pass from Hassle to Navarro.

439
00:33:13,243 --> 00:33:18,498
I felt
my life begin!

440
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:24,379
So, open up your heart
and let!

441
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:31,261
This fool rush in!

442
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:45,275
Well, that's enough
of that shit.

443
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:47,277
Your voice
is so beautiful.

444
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,655
Yeah, well.
Let's go and eat.

445
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:52,449
- Can I hear one more?
- No, I'm hungry.

446
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,451
I'm shaking without dinner.
Let's go.

447
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:58,163
- Please, just one more song.
- No more! Okay?

448
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:06,964
I'm sorry, honey.
Jesus Christ.

449
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:10,050
Hey, listen,
when we finish eating,

450
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:12,928
I'll look around,
find a tape for you.

451
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:15,472
You take it home,
play it anytime you want, okay?

452
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:17,975
- Okay.
- 'Cause Daddy loves you, you know that.

453
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:21,436
I love you.
Let's go.

454
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,496
They have four linebackers,
and the rest are defensive backs.

455
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,915
It'll make Buffalo think about
keeping the ball in the air.

456
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:44,084
It's a challenge.

457
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:46,128
They're trying to say,
if you're going to go anywhere,

458
00:34:46,211 --> 00:34:48,172
you're gonna have
to throw it in the air.

459
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,132
Billy, you're right.

460
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:53,844
Your father does have
the most beautiful voice.

461
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:58,432
Careful, everybody. It's very hot.

462
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:00,434
Hope you like tripe.

463
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:02,436
Oh, actually,
I don't know what that is.

464
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,438
Well, the Italians
call it trippa.

465
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:08,150
It's the intestines of the cow,
and it's very good for you.

466
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:13,655
It's terrific. Isn't that what
you said was your favorite food?

467
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:15,657
- Go ahead, honey.
- Go ahead.

468
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:18,952
- Tell me what you think.
- Go ahead, Wendy. Take a big bite.

469
00:35:19,036 --> 00:35:22,331
Go ahead. Take a big,
bigger bite. Mmm.

470
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:24,333
- That a girl.
- There you go. Bring more, Ma.

471
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,919
She's going to eat a lot.
I sense it.

472
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:30,881
Well, everybody
gets the same.

473
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:37,804
Turn that knife away from me, please.

474
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:40,557
Why are you pointing that knife at me?
That why you came,

475
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:43,060
to stab me with
that knife, huh?

476
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:45,062
Will you turn it away
from me, please?

477
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:47,272
- Honey, calm down.
- Turn it away, please!

478
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:50,067
What, what?
The knife is not pointed at you!

479
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,069
- It's pointed at me!
- Honey!

480
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:54,071
- Don't tell me you didn't point the knife at me.
- I did not.

481
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:56,073
Don't point a knife at a person
unless you wanna use it!

482
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:58,534
I didn't point the knife at you!
It was here!

483
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,536
- On the table, like that!
- It was not here!

484
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:03,038
- Point it over here. Over here.
- Fine. Fine.

485
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,040
Honey, calm down,
all right?

486
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:07,042
- I am calm.
- All right. She's talking, all right?

487
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:09,336
- Did you see what your son did?
- I didn't do nothin'.

488
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:11,755
- He pointed a knife at his father.
- Yeah, yeah.

489
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,050
- I pointed it at you. It's always at you, Dad.
- Honey, honey.

490
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:17,845
- You want some more tripe, honey?
- No, I don't want tripe.

491
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,847
You want to get me tripe?
Get me tripe.

492
00:36:19,972 --> 00:36:22,891
No, listen, let him fill up
on the bread. Enough tripe.

493
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:27,020
- Let me eat bread. That's what he wants me to eat.
- That's your son.

494
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:29,064
Bread all the time,
right?

495
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:32,192
God forbid I should
have a piece of meat, right, Dad?

496
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:35,320
So, um, Wendy, honey.
You were saying?

497
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:40,284
I was just, um,
I was gonna say how Billy's the...

498
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:42,786
the nicest husband
in the whole world.

499
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,788
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'm sure he's terrific.

500
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:47,791
No, really.
I'm the luckiest girl...

501
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,793
to have found
such a wonderful husband.

502
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:52,546
I fell in love with him
the first time I met him.

503
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:55,924
Long-lasting Energizer
batteries keep going...

504
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:59,303
Honey, can you pass me
the remote control, there?

505
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:01,054
It's right behind you.

506
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:04,183
Still going. Long-lasting Energizer...

507
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:06,185
Did Billy ever tell you
how we met?

508
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,522
Oh, um, no, honey.
How did you two meet?

509
00:37:10,606 --> 00:37:13,901
Billy, you didn't
tell your mom how we met?

510
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:17,487
You tell her.

511
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:23,118
Well. I was working
as a typist for the C.I.A.,

512
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,245
which is a special part
of the government.

513
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:28,081
And Billy is a top agent
with the C.I.A.

514
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:31,084
I'm sure you know that.
You're probably so proud of him.

515
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:34,087
Anyway, he has hundreds
of people working for him.

516
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:37,090
All the girls in the office
were always telling me...

517
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:39,218
how much they were
in love with their boss.

518
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:41,345
I had never seen him,
because I worked way down...

519
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,347
on the other side
of the building.

520
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,934
But one day, he comes
into the office, and I see him,

521
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:51,438
and I fell in love...
madly in love... with him.

522
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:56,401
But, you know, I couldn't talk to him,
because I was just a typist, and...

523
00:37:56,485 --> 00:38:01,365
He's the kindest, smartest,
most handsome guy there.

524
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:05,744
I mean, even the guys loved him.
They idolized him.

525
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:08,330
So, I just,
I just couldn't.

526
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:11,500
I didn't think he'd ever like me.
I was just a typist girl.

527
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:14,086
And, you know,
he was like, the king.

528
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:18,131
I mean, even the president
is so proud of him.

529
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:20,133
So, one day...

530
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:22,135
I walk into my office,

531
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:25,848
and there's this giant
bouquet of roses.

532
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:29,017
I was just like, my God,
what are those flowers on my desk?

533
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:31,687
I thought maybe they had gotten
the wrong desk or something.

534
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:33,689
So, I go over
and I open the card.

535
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,691
There was
a little note attached.

536
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:38,819
And it said:
"Dear Wendy, I have been in love...

537
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:41,613
"with you for a year,
but I'm very shy.

538
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:44,199
"I didn't know how
to tell you before this.

539
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:46,994
"But I want you to know
that I really love you,

540
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:49,288
and I'd love to take you out
to dinner sometime. "

541
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:52,583
- And guess who it was signed by?
- Who?

542
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:56,545
- Honey, honey, hold on. Watch this play, all right?
- Billy.

543
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:59,840
It was signed by Billy.
It said, "Love, Billy. "

544
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:03,302
Uh-huh. Watch this play,
all right? Just watch this.

545
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:05,304
Linder will snap.

546
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:12,352
Wood tries
to kick his longest ever on grass.

547
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:15,397
No good!

548
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:20,360
Aah, goddamn it.
Goddamn it!

549
00:39:22,446 --> 00:39:26,116
Thirty years,
I haven't missed a game.

550
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,162
They haven't won
the championship since 1966.

551
00:39:30,245 --> 00:39:34,041
I missed that game,
'cause that's the day I had Billy.

552
00:39:34,082 --> 00:39:38,837
Oh, I wish
I never had him.

553
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:42,257
I wouldn't have
missed that game.

554
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:44,259
Wow.

555
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,638
Did you like
Buffalo too?

556
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,979
Um, it's Billy Brown calling.

557
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:58,982
I'd like to bet
on the Super Bowl.

558
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:05,989
On Buffalo.

559
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:08,283
To win.

560
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:11,954
Right.

561
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:13,956
Um.

562
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,630
I'd like to put
10,000 on it.

563
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:23,632
- Oh, $10,000!
- Hold on one second.

564
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:25,676
That's too much, Billy!
You're gonna get in trouble!

565
00:40:25,717 --> 00:40:27,719
Shut up.
I'm talking on the phone!

566
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:29,763
Come on, Scott.
Come on, Scott.

567
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:33,267
Wood tries
to kick his longest ever on grass.

568
00:40:35,853 --> 00:40:38,730
No good! Wide right.
- Oh, no. Fuck!

569
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:40,732
Told you. You're gonna be in trouble.

570
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:42,734
- Shut up!
- I told you.

571
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:44,736
I'm fucked.

572
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,574
- You're dead.
- I am fuckin' dead.

573
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,702
Okay, the story goes like this.

574
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:55,622
One day,
this big asshole comes in,

575
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:57,624
he calls up a bet.

576
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:00,794
$10,000 bet on Buffalo
to win the Super Bowl.

577
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:02,838
That's to win, okay?

578
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,340
Now, I know what
you're thinking.

579
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:08,677
The story's hard
to believe, right?

580
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,015
I mean, what kind
of an idiot would bet...

581
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:15,017
on Buffalo to win
a big game like that?

582
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:19,646
It's true,
I swear to God it happened.

583
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,690
I mean, this guy
was so out of touch...

584
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:25,152
he didn't even have the ten large
to cover his bet.

585
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:31,116
Hey, tell somebody
to turn up the heat.

586
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,243
So, Billy.

587
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:37,039
What happened was this bookie
got so sick...

588
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,499
of hearing everybody's excuses.

589
00:41:39,625 --> 00:41:41,502
I mean, they're all the same,
you know?

590
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:43,545
Everybody's got an excuse.

591
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:48,550
Anyway, this bookie got so sick
that he just had to throw up.

592
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:55,349
The only way he could make himself feel
better was to... to do bad things.

593
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:03,565
To do very,
very bad things to the excuse maker.

594
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:08,695
And very, very bad things to the
excuse maker's mother and father.

595
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:11,240
So, what do you say?

596
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:15,744
Why don't we give this story
a happy ending?

597
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:19,748
I got an acquaintance,
a friend,

598
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:23,335
a very good friend of ours,
and he just got arrested.

599
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:27,256
Of course, he's innocent.

600
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:31,552
His arrest is
a goddamn injustice, a tragedy.

601
00:42:31,593 --> 00:42:34,179
So, you, the asshole,

602
00:42:34,263 --> 00:42:37,099
will confess to the crime
of which he is accused,

603
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:40,686
so as to free
the innocent man.

604
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:43,897
Now, if you fail...

605
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:45,941
to convince the court,

606
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:50,070
or if you refuse
to try to,

607
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:54,992
then very evil and very bad things
are gonna happen.

608
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:58,287
Very evil
and very bad things.

609
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:00,831
Oh, and, Billy.

610
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:03,792
If Buffalo ever makes it back
to the Super Bowl,

611
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:06,712
bet against them.

612
00:43:06,795 --> 00:43:09,381
Now, get the fuck
out of my sight.

613
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:16,471
All rise.

614
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:22,060
Mr. Brown,
based on your confession,

615
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:24,396
you are found guilty
as charged.

616
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,398
Therefore, it is the judgment
of this court...

617
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:28,942
that you are sentenced
to the maximum term.

618
00:43:29,026 --> 00:43:32,321
Five years. No parole.

619
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:40,746
This one is going to go in June.

620
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:42,748
See how I've
been doing it?

621
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:44,750
I write on every envelope.
You don't have to think, Goon.

622
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,793
This goes in June.

623
00:43:46,835 --> 00:43:49,796
Any day in June.

624
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,634
Any day in June.
All you have to look at...

625
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:55,636
is the thing,
like all the other ones.

626
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:59,139
You look at the month.
Goon, Goon, pay attention.

627
00:43:59,223 --> 00:44:01,183
We're almost done.
We're almost done.

628
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:03,644
This one says June.
They all have a month marked.

629
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:07,648
This one goes June. June comes
before July, and after May.

630
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:10,400
So anytime you hear
that it's June,

631
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:13,403
just put this in the mailbox,
all right?

632
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:15,656
Can I trust you on these?
Are we done with these?

633
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:18,784
Got it?
They all got their own month.

634
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,036
Any day of the month, you could send it.
You know the month,

635
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,038
because it's written
on the back.

636
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:25,791
This one goes
at Christmastime.

637
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:28,794
Please, please, don't pick
your nose in front of me.

638
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:31,296
Please don't do that,
all right?

639
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,298
This goes at Christmastime.

640
00:44:34,758 --> 00:44:36,718
Christmas.
Do you know when Christmas is?

641
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,720
- I know when Christmas is, Billy.
- You do?

642
00:44:38,762 --> 00:44:41,181
- You know Rudolph is on TV?
- You think I'm dumb?

643
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:44,893
Yeah, I think you're
a little dumb sometimes.

644
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,563
Cut it out, Billy,
or I'm not going to do it.

645
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:49,565
Yeah, right.
Just listen to me.

646
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,401
You wanna know
what I heard in here?

647
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:54,403
You know Scott Wood?

648
00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:58,407
I heard from guys in here
who know for a fact, okay.

649
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:03,036
They know for a fact that he missed
that fuckin' field goal on purpose.

650
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,790
That he got paid money
and he missed it on purpose, okay?

651
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:10,294
That motherfuck. That motherfuck.
I wonder how much.

652
00:45:10,377 --> 00:45:14,590
I wonder how much that motherfuck
got paid to ruin my fuckin' life.

653
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:16,592
Okay?
I'll tell you what.

654
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:19,303
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do. Listen.

655
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:23,182
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

656
00:45:23,307 --> 00:45:26,393
I swear to God,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.

657
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:29,313
That motherfuckin',
ten-cent field goal kicker.

658
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:31,607
I'm gonna kill him.
I'll tell you something.

659
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,026
I'll kill myself too,
'cause I don't give a fuck,

660
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:36,403
'cause I'm not coming
back here, understand?

661
00:45:36,445 --> 00:45:39,656
You understand?
So just remember what I told you.

662
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:42,910
What are you lookin' at?

663
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:45,454
What are you lookin' at?

664
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,418
You got this, right?
You got this, and this.

665
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,922
When is this one going?
This one is going in January.

666
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:58,342
This is for my mother's birthday.
All right? January.

667
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:00,886
Let me write it down
on every package, okay?

668
00:46:00,969 --> 00:46:05,265
January. Goon, please, please,
please, don't fuck me here.

669
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:07,351
Please, be a person
this time.

670
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:12,814
Could I use the phone
in the bedroom?

671
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,776
- Sure, honey.
- Where are you calling, a local call?

672
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:17,778
- Yes, a local call.
- Okay.

673
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:48,433
Hey, Goon. It's me, Billy.
What are you doing?

674
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:53,397
Billy, I don't want people
to call me that no more.

675
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,358
Even you.

676
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,486
Hello to you too.
Uh, why, what?

677
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,530
What do they
call you now?

678
00:47:01,572 --> 00:47:03,532
What do you want them
to call you?

679
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:05,492
Um, my new name
is Rocky.

680
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:10,038
Um, your name is Rocky,
huh?

681
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:12,040
My new name is Rocky!

682
00:47:12,124 --> 00:47:14,543
Rocky, I go away
for two seconds,

683
00:47:14,585 --> 00:47:18,547
and you change your name
from Goon to Rocky, huh?

684
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:21,550
Whatever, all right. Whatever you want.

685
00:47:21,592 --> 00:47:23,552
Whatever you want.
Listen.

686
00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:28,015
Um, I just got out
of jail, and, uh,

687
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:30,767
you remember
that guy, Wood?

688
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:34,062
I'd really like
to find him.

689
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:37,524
Billy, you going, you still going
to do that bad thing...

690
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:39,693
you said you were
going to do?

691
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:44,198
Don't, don't you think
that's not a good thing to do?

692
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:46,325
What if the policeman
catches you?

693
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:48,785
Yeah, well, I'm not going
to get caught, okay?

694
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:50,871
I'm not going
to get caught.

695
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:53,874
You want to help me or
you don't want to help me, huh?

696
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:58,712
Well, he's got the TV commercial
and he's got that club...

697
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:01,340
where the girls
take off their clothes.

698
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:04,927
What? The guy opens up
a strip joint in Buffalo?

699
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,179
Billy, you wanna come
over to my house?

700
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:09,181
You wanna come over
for dinner?

701
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:11,183
My mom's makin'...
she's cookin' dinner.

702
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:14,811
What's... What's the name
of the club? Hey, Goon.

703
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:18,357
- Huh?
- What's the name of the joint?

704
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:21,944
Oh, it's this...
It's the name of his name.

705
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:25,405
It's got his name.
It's named, yeah.

706
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:27,533
You know a street?
You know anything? Can you help me?

707
00:48:27,658 --> 00:48:29,576
Could you give me
a street name?

708
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,578
You're confusing me.
I don't know.

709
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:34,164
I don't remember.
You shouldn't go down there.

710
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:36,166
Don't go down there.

711
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,585
I have a little surprise
that, um,

712
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:40,879
- I haven't told Billy yet.
- Oh, yeah?

713
00:48:40,963 --> 00:48:43,507
- I'm pregnant. We're gonna have a baby.
- Oh!

714
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,677
Wendy, honey,
you're gonna have a baby!

715
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,304
- You're gonna have a baby!
- Don't tell Billy.

716
00:48:49,388 --> 00:48:51,306
I want to
surprise him later.

717
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,308
- We won't say nothin'.
- That's terrific.

718
00:48:53,392 --> 00:48:56,812
Come here and give me
a hug! Yeah!

719
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:00,983
I won't say nothin'.

720
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:05,821
See, Goon,
I'm just kidding. All right?

721
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:07,823
I'm just kidding.

722
00:49:07,906 --> 00:49:09,825
I just want to go
and say hello to him.

723
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:11,827
Can you help me find him,
yes or no?

724
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,329
I know how you get.

725
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:16,331
Don't, you're going
to go back to jail.

726
00:49:16,415 --> 00:49:18,333
What'd I say?
I said I was kidding.

727
00:49:18,417 --> 00:49:20,419
You got a phone book
in the house?

728
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:22,296
Don't do bad things.

729
00:49:22,337 --> 00:49:24,298
Just don't do
any bad things.

730
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:26,633
Did you get
the raisins I sent you?

731
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:29,303
Yeah, Goon,
I got the raisins. Thanks.

732
00:49:29,344 --> 00:49:31,346
Do you have a phone book?
Can you help me out?

733
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,348
Can you
help me out here?

734
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:35,851
Don't call me that.
I don't like that name no more.

735
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:39,605
All right. All right. Rocky, Rocky,
Rocky! Okay, I'll call you Rocky.

736
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:42,316
You happy, big shot?
You happy, Rocky?

737
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:44,318
What's the difference
what your name is?

738
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:46,320
Would you do me a favor,
and get a phone book?

739
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:48,322
Billy, I got to go.
My mom's calling me.

740
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:50,324
She's mad that I'm
on the phone too long.

741
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:53,535
You know something, Goon?
You know what you are?

742
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:55,621
You know your problem?
Your problem is your mother.

743
00:49:55,662 --> 00:49:57,623
Because you know what?
That's all you do.

744
00:49:57,664 --> 00:50:00,626
You run when your mom calls you
all the time.

745
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:03,420
Can you just get
a phone book?

746
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:07,216
- No, I gotta go. My mom said I gotta go.
- I need you for one second.

747
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:12,012
- Get a phone book.
- Don't be sore at me like that, Billy.

748
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,014
I just need you
to get a phone book!

749
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:16,266
Every time your mother says
something, that's how you...

750
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,268
That's why people
call you Goon.

751
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:20,270
Do you know why
they call you Goon?

752
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:23,857
Because you're retarded.
And you're ugly. You're an ugly retard.

753
00:50:23,941 --> 00:50:25,943
And they call you Goon because
you're ugly and retarded.

754
00:50:25,984 --> 00:50:27,903
And you'll always
be Goon.

755
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:31,114
Goon, Goon, Goon. And that's
what I'm going to call you...

756
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:33,116
for the rest of your life,
is Goon.

757
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,120
Goon, Goon, Goon, Goon. Okay?
So fuck you.

758
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:42,584
Fuck.

759
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:59,184
Oh, honey.
You're gonna have a baby!

760
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:03,272
Well, it's really been
a pleasure having you here.

761
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:05,274
And when you have
a little one,

762
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:07,693
I want you to call it
little Jimmy!

763
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:11,613
Honey, we love you
so much, honey.

764
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:13,574
You come back soon,
all right?

765
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:16,285
You guys have to come visit us too.
The house is so beautiful.

766
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:19,746
Billy's so handy.
He's built so many amazing things.

767
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,832
Yeah, well, now you have
another house, huh?

768
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:24,877
And I want you to give your daddy
a big kiss. Come on.

769
00:51:27,004 --> 00:51:29,756
Oh, honey,
we love you so much.

770
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,758
- You come back and visit soon, all right?
- We will.

771
00:51:31,842 --> 00:51:33,802
- All right?
- We will. Bye.

772
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:35,762
Bye, honey.

773
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:47,608
Ho, ho, ho, go! Come on!

774
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:50,652
Can't believe them!

775
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:54,031
No, Billy, it's good.
It's good if they like me.

776
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:56,033
Then, they'll be proud of you.

777
00:51:56,074 --> 00:51:58,452
Bullshit! My life is shit.

778
00:51:58,535 --> 00:52:01,622
If you were my son, I'd be proud of you.

779
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:04,875
Did you see them
kiss your ass? You made it happen.

780
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:07,836
You made them do that.

781
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,632
You kidnapped me.
You pulled my hair. You threatened me.

782
00:52:11,673 --> 00:52:14,468
I just went in there
and did you a favor.

783
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:17,387
- I thought I did a good job...
What was that shit about the C.I.A.?

784
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:20,057
I asked you nice. I said nice.

785
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,351
Make me look good!

786
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:24,353
What, C.I.A.?
You think my father believed that?

787
00:52:24,436 --> 00:52:26,522
Do you think he believed that
for one second?

788
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:28,815
"Your son works with the C.I.A.
All the girls love him.

789
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:32,069
He's smart.
He's smart!"

790
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:45,666
Let's go.

791
00:53:09,398 --> 00:53:11,358
Hey!

792
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,360
Hey, look, everybody.
The king is back!

793
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:16,363
Oh, that's right.
The king is here.

794
00:53:16,405 --> 00:53:18,365
- Billy Brown!
- What's up?

795
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:20,742
- Nice to see you, man.
- Good to see you.

796
00:53:20,826 --> 00:53:24,413
You look really good.
Really good. Really good.

797
00:53:24,496 --> 00:53:27,040
So, you guys keep
my ball and stuff?

798
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:30,335
Did we keep your ball?

799
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:32,421
We got your ball,
your locker.

800
00:53:32,504 --> 00:53:34,423
All right.
You better have kept it.

801
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:37,426
- Just like you left it.
- All right.

802
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:43,182
What?
You pay my membership?

803
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:45,392
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

804
00:53:45,434 --> 00:53:47,394
You weren't here
to pay it,

805
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:49,396
so I paid it for you,
because I'm your friend, right?

806
00:53:49,438 --> 00:53:51,648
All right.
You used your own money?

807
00:53:51,732 --> 00:53:53,650
- Yeah.
- All right. I owe you for that.

808
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:56,653
- Sure, you're my friend.
- All right. You're my friend too.

809
00:53:56,737 --> 00:54:00,532
So, any good bowlers around
these days? Anybody good?

810
00:54:01,617 --> 00:54:03,535
- Just you, Billy.
- All right.

811
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,538
Um, who's the girl?

812
00:54:06,622 --> 00:54:09,374
- I'm his wife.
- She's not my wife.

813
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:11,418
I picked her up hitchhiking.

814
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,755
Five years in the joint,
you don't waste any time, huh?

815
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:16,757
You know me, right?

816
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:20,802
I'm going to go get my things
out of the locker.

817
00:54:20,886 --> 00:54:23,555
I'll give you 13.
That's the one you like, right?

818
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:26,016
Yeah, that's my lane.
All right, I'll see you in a minute.
