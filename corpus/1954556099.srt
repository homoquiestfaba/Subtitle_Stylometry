   get this tie?

No cop on earth
would wear a tie like this.

it's perfect

and I thought it was
a very bad idea. Seriously.

   Excuse me?

  He's in the bushes,

What are you talking about?
Have you gone
completely nuts?

 All right, all right,
 look, I warned you,
 he's very, very small.

361
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,635
 Go ahead,
 real small.

362
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,305
   This is ridiculous.
   There's nobody in there.

363
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,540
 And extremely fast.

 He's right behind you.

365
00:25:44,942 --> 00:25:46,144
Turn around,
he's right behind you.
Turn around.

 Look, I don't know what
 the hell kind of game
 you're trying to play here,

373
00:25:58,322 --> 00:25:59,591

  too tired for this.

   You say talk.

 No, I want you
 to listen.

00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,981
 Listen, okay?

382
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:24,148
 You see this stone right here?

00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:25,750
  You see this stone?

384
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:27,986
 Look, this blind,
 screaming giant
 is a killer.

385
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,087
   He is a killer.

386
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,788
   And I need to nail him.

387
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:32,957
  And unless you help
  me track him down,

388
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,859
  you're never gonna
  see this again.
  You understand me?

 What's shava?

393
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:50,908
 Okay, so this giant here,
 what are we talking about,

394
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:52,410
six, seven, eight feet?
What is it?

395
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:53,745
  Giant.

   Oh, I'm a giant?

403
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:11,062
  Yeah.

404
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:12,430
  Okay, if I'm a giant,
  what does that make you?

Good size.

406
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:13,798

00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:44,062
  So, let me get this straight.
  The perpetrator was a
  guy wearing sunglasses?

417
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,230
Right.

00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:47,432

 Somebody gets blown to bits,
 that seems perfectly
 reasonable to me.

 But then all those cops
 show up and I say to myself,

 "This little creep,
 he must be a cop."

so what?

 to die for it?

Bad, your breath.

1207
01:18:23,531 --> 01:18:24,900
CASEY: What's this?

1208
01:18:25,466 --> 01:18:27,502
 The bullet.

1209
01:18:27,535 --> 01:18:28,837
 A very flat bullet.

1210
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,005
 Thick-skinned
 little runt.

1211
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:33,842
  Hold him.

1212
01:18:37,011 --> 01:18:38,747
 (GROANS)

1213
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:40,082
 Had to do it.

1214
01:19:09,443 --> 01:19:11,412
 The lumen's in the bag.
 Why don't you hang out
 for a while, Gnorm?

1215
01:19:11,445 --> 01:19:14,415
 Hmm, my people need lumen.

1216
01:19:14,448 --> 01:19:16,518
 Well, you're people
 need lumen, huh?

1217
01:19:17,985 --> 01:19:20,555
 So you're in
 a big rush, huh?

1218
01:19:20,588 --> 01:19:23,191
 You know, I'm smelling
 a Rena thing, Gnorm.

1219
01:19:23,224 --> 01:19:25,493
 You just can't wait to wrap
 those horny little gnome lips
 around Rena's.

1220
01:19:25,526 --> 01:19:26,427
 That's what it is, isn't it?

1221
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,329
   Gnorm warrior now.

1222
01:19:28,362 --> 01:19:30,999
 Rena likes warriors, huh?

1223
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:32,467
 You take good care
 of yourself, okay?

1224
01:19:42,143 --> 01:19:43,311
  Enough, enough, enough...

1225
01:19:43,344 --> 01:19:44,880
 (LAUGHING) Enough!

1226
01:19:51,152 --> 01:19:53,888
  Now you take it easy.
  Okay, pal?

1227
01:19:53,921 --> 01:19:56,158
  And, uh, don't
  be afraid to call
  your old buddy sometime.

1228
01:19:57,391 --> 01:19:58,260
 Drop me a postcard.

1229
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:04,232
  Hell, how do say goodbye
  to a gnome?

1230
01:20:04,265 --> 01:20:05,867
  You say goodbye!

1231
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:08,236
   Ah, shava.

1232
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:11,540
 Pooka Sam, hot ticket.

1233
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:17,445
 Hey, just get out of here,
 you thick-skinned little runt.

1234
01:20:22,383 --> 01:20:23,485
   (RUMBLING)

1235
01:20:30,658 --> 01:20:32,060
 Well, he's gone.

1236
01:20:33,294 --> 01:20:36,231
   Yeah, he's gone.

1237
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:41,536
 Well, ah,
 just us then, huh?

1238
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:45,140
  Yep. Just you and me.

1239
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:48,210
Just two of us.

1240
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,150
Uh... (CLEARING THROAT)

1241
01:20:57,184 --> 01:21:00,155
   Hey, slug lips.
   Something wrong with you?

1242
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:03,124
