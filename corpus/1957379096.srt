00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
HALLMARK HOME ENTERTAINMENT

2
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
AHH!

3
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
THIS IS GOING
TO BE SO MUCH FUN,

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
SEEING SERENA AGAIN.

5
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I WONDER IF SHE'S
AS EXCITED AS I AM.

6
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
IT'S HER HUSBAND'S
FUNERAL, MAGGIE.

7
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
OH, IRA, WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO BE SO NEGATIVE
ABOUT EVERYTHING?

8
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT.

9
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
YOU BETTER HURRY UP.

10
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
WE GOT A LONG DRIVE.

11
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
MAX DIES ON WEDNESDAY.

12
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
SHE WAITS
TILL THE LAST THING
FRIDAY NIGHT TO CALL.

13
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
NO TIME TO CHECK ROUTES,
NOTIFY CUSTOMERS.

14
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
MONDAY'S THE DAY I
SHOULD CLOSE THE SHOP.

15
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
WELL, I'M SURE MAX WOULD
HAVE HELD ON LONGER

16
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
IF HE'D JUST KNOWN.

17
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I HOPE SERENA
DOESN'T EXPECT ME

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
TO BE A PALL BEARER.

19
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
SHE DIDN'T MENTION THAT.

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
SHE JUST SAID
SHE NEEDED OUR HELP.

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
WELL, I THINK SHE MEANT,
YOU KNOW, MORAL SUPPORT.

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
MAYBE PALL BEARING
IS MORAL SUPPORT.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
WOULDN'T THAT BE
PHYSICAL SUPPORT?

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
MMM. MAYBE.

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
OH.

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
ONE SLICE MEDIUM BROWN,
NO BUTTER.

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
OH, THANK YOU, HONEY.

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
OH.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
AHH!

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
DAISY, YOU
ARE SO ORGANIZED.

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT.

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
SELF PRESERVATION.

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE ALL PACKED.

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'VE BEEN ALL PACKED
FOR A WEEK.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
YOU DIDN'T PACK
YOUR TEDDY BEAR.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
MOM, I'M
GOING TO COLLEGE,

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
NOT SOME
SLUMBER PARTY.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'LL BET YOU WOULDN'T
BE THE ONLY ONE.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
MOTHER, PLEASE.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
IT JUST SEEMS SO SAD,
YOU KNOW?

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I MEAN, DAVE STOOD
BY YOU ALL THESE YEARS

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
THROUGH THICK AND THIN.

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS DRESS?

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
IT'S O.K.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
SWEETIE, I AM SO SORRY

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
THAT WE'RE
GOING TO GO OFF

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
AND LEAVE YOU
BY YOURSELF

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
ON YOUR
LAST FULL DAY HOME.

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
THAT WAS WHEN I WAS 13.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
AT LEAST WE'LL HAVE YOU
ALL BY OURSELVES TOMORROW

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
ON THE DRIVE TO COLLEGE.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
MMM.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000

DAISY...

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
WOULD YOU CALL JESSE
AND SAY GOOD-BYE?

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
WHY CAN'T HE COME OUT
OF HIS WAY FOR A CHANGE

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO ME?

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
OH, WELL,
YOU KNOW JESSE.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
BARELY.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
WHOO! WHOO
WHOO WHOO!

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
OH, HI, JESSE.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OUT HERE
ALL GUSSIED UP?

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
YOU RUNNING AWAY
FROM HOME?

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'M LATE. I'M
GOING TO A FUNERAL,

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
MAX GILL'S,
SERENA GILL'S HUSBAND.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
YOU KNOW THEM.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I DO?

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
YEAH, YEAH.
DEERLICK, PENNSYLVANIA.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
YOU'RE WALKING ALL
THE WAY TO DEERLICK,
PENNSYLVANIA?

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
NO. I'M GOING
TO THE BODY SHOP
FOR THE CAR.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'D DRIVE YOU,

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
BUT THESE PIPES WOULD
KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
CAN I BORROW THAT
TV FROM MY OLD ROOM?

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
OH, WELL,
IT--IT'S BROKEN.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
OH, MAN. JUST MY LUCK.

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
THAT'S THE WAY
YOU RETURNED IT.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
YEAH. OH, OH, JESSE.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
IF WE DO HAVE TIME,
WE MIGHT GO BY CARTWHEEL

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
AND SEE FIONA
AND LEROY.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU
WANT ME TO TELL THEM?

86
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
THE TEMPERATURE TODAY
IN BALTIMORE

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
IS A WARM 89.

A DOUBLE-HEADER WITH
THE CALIFORNIA ANGELS.

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
MORNING, DAD.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
DARN EARLY FOR YOU
TO BE PLOWING AROUND
DOWN THERE.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I ALMOST CALLED THE COPS.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
WELL, I'M CLOSING UP
SHOP TODAY.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I WAS PUTTING A SIGN
IN THE WINDOW.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
HER HIGHNESS
FIND SOMETHING BETTER
FOR YOU TO DO

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
THAN EARNING A LIVING?

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
WE'RE GOING
TO A FUNERAL.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A FUNERAL
DON'T TAKE ALL DAY.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I DON'T EXPECT YOU

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
TO CLOSE UP SHOP
THE WHOLE DAY
WHEN I GO.

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
YEAH. WE HAVE
TO DRIVE TO DEERLICK,
PENNSYLVANIA.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
MORANS HAVE GOT NO KIN
IN DEERLICK, PENNSYLVANIA.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
MAX GILL, UH,

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
HUSBAND OF
MAGGIE'S BEST FRIEND.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
AHH, FIGURES.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
SO YOU PROBABLY
NEVER HEARD OF HIM,

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
BUT YOU GOT TO CLOSE UP
SHOP ON SATURDAY

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
AND GO THERE,

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
AND YOU PROBABLY NEVER
HEARD OF HIM.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
WE SANG AT
THEIR WEDDING, DAD.

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
DON'T LET ME KEEP YOU.

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
DON'T KEEP
THE PRINCESS WAITING.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
JUST DON'T EXPECT ME TO
TRAIPSE UP AND DOWN STAIRS

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
IF THE PHONE RINGS.

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
JUST LET IT RING, AND
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000

SHOP ON SATURDAYS,

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
YOU'LL BE PUTTING
A "FOR SALE" SIGN
IN THE WINDOW,

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
AND THEN WHERE
WILL YOU BE?

125
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
HELLO.

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. MORAN.

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
UHH!

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
THANK YOU.

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
HEH HEH HEH. OOH!

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
SORRY. I HAD
TO SLIDE IT BACK.

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
THAT'S O.K. I LIKE IT
ON THE SECOND NOTCH.

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
PERFECT MATCH.

133
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
FOUND THE ORIGINAL
COLOR TRIM.

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
WHAT'S THAT?

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
THE PAINT.

136
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
OH, IT'S LOVELY.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
IT SMELLS JUST LIKE
FRESH NAIL POLISH.

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
THIS IS MEL SPRUCE.
WELCOME BACK.

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
LOVE AND MARRIAGE.

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
SO YOU'VE OUTGROWN
THE LOVE THING,
IS THAT RIGHT?

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
NO. I SAID
THE FIRST TIME
I GOT MARRIED,

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
IT WAS FOR LOVE...

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
FIONA?

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
THIS TIME,
I'M GOING FOR SECURITY.

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'VE GOT A 7-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER TO SUPPORT.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
FIONA.

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
LOOK OUT!
[HONK]

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
MRS. MORAN,
ARE YOU O.K.?

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
CERTAINLY.
WHY DO YOU ASK?

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
AREN'T YOU
GOING TO ASK ME
ABOUT THE FENDER?

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
OH, YOU
NOTICED THAT, TOO.

153
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
THAT'S JUST LIKE YOU,
IRA MORAN.

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
OH, LOOK,
WAIT A MINUTE.

155
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
IT'S YOUR DENT,
BUT IT'S MY FAULT,
RIGHT?

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
OH, THAT'S WHAT
EVERYBODY EXPECTS OF ME.

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
MAGGIE ALWAYS
DOES THINGS SO DUMB.

159
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
NO. I WAS JUST
LOOKING FORWARD

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
TO THAT
MAGICAL FIVE MINUTES,

161
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
THAT FRESH
OUT-OF-THE-PAINT-SHOP
SPARKLE

162
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
WHEN THE OLD GIRL
LOOKS LIKE NEW AGAIN.

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
IRA, I'M SO SORRY.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I WAS JUST DRIVING
OUT OF THE SHOP.

166
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
SUDDENLY, FIONA
CAME ON THE RADIO

167
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
SAYING SHE WAS
GETTING MARRIED AGAIN.

168
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
MY FOOT HIT THE GAS
INSTEAD OF THE BRAKE.

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
HOW COULD THAT HAPPEN?

170
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
FIONA CAME ON THE RADIO.
I WAS STARTLED.

171
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
THE BRAKE
ISN'T SOMETHING

172
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
YOU HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT.

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
YOU'VE BEEN DRIVING

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
SINCE YOU WERE
16 YEARS OLD, MAGGIE!

175
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
HOW CAN YOU MIX THE GAS
WITH THE BRAKE PEDAL?

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I WAS STARTLED,
AND I JUST DID.

177
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
DROP IT.

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
THE BRAKE
IS A REFLEX.

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'LL PAY FOR IT
OUT OF MY SALARY.

180
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
WELL, THAT WILL TAKE
A LITTLE WHILE...

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
WITH WHAT THEY PAY
AT THE NURSING HOME.

182
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I SUPPOSE I
SHOULD HAVE STOPPED,

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO
LEAVE YOU STANDING HERE

184
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
WONDERING
WHAT BECAME OF ME.

185
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
YOU WERE INVOLVED
IN A HIT-AND-RUN
ACCIDENT?

186
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
WELL, HE HIT ME,
AND I RAN.

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
WHAT DOES THAT MAKE IT?

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
OH, WELL,
NO NEED TO WORRY.

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
THE BODY SHOP HAS
OUR NAME AND ADDRESS.

190
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
THE COPS WILL
BE AT THE HOUSE

191
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
WHEN WE GET BACK
FROM THE FUNERAL.

192
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
YOU CAN INVITE THEM
ALL IN FOR SUPPER.

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT
THEIR WIVES AND KIDS
BY DARK.

194
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
WELL, I DON'T
SEE ANYTHING WRONG
WITH BEING FRIENDLY.

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU
FORGOT TO BRING THE MAP.

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I DIDN'T FORGET
TO BRING IT.

197
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I REMEMBERED
NOT TO BRING IT.

198
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
WHEN WE GET LOST,
REMEMBER THAT.

199
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
WELL, WE WON'T GET LOST.

200
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
SERENA SAID YOU TAKE
HIGHWAY 10 TURNOFF,

201
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
AND THAT TAKES YOU
PRACTICALLY THERE.

202
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I SEEM TO REMEMBER
A TURNOFF FARTHER NORTH.

203
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
NO. JUST
TAKE HIGHWAY 10.

204
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
DARN, I MEANT
TO CALL MRS. STOLTZ
FROM THE SHOP.

205
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
SHE WAS BRINGING IN
ALL HER LATEST
WATERCOLORS TODAY.

206
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
THAT'S O.K.
WE'LL CALL JESSE.

207
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
HE'LL GO BY THE SHOP,
LOOK UP HER NUMBER,

208
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
AND GIVE HER A CALL.

209
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
JESSE TOOK THE BELL
OFF HIS TELEPHONE.

210
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
THE WHOLE
CIVILIZED WORLD

211
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
MOVING
TOWARD TELEPHONES
WITH PICTURES,

212
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
AND YOUR SON DOESN'T
HAVE ONE WITH A BELL.

213
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
THE THING
I LOVE ABOUT JESSE

214
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
IS HE IS SO CAREFREE.

215
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
CAREFREE.

216
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
ONE OF THE WORLD'S
GREAT ROCK MUSICIANS

217
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
SELLING MOTORCYCLES
FOR A LIVING,

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
THIS WEEK, AT LEAST.

219
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
THAT IS JUST
A SOMETIME THING.

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
LOOK, EVERYTHING WITH
JESSE IS SOMETIMES--

221
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
JOBS, MARRIAGE,
FATHERHOOD.

222
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
YOU KNOW, IRA,
I WAS THINKING.

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
WE COULD STOP BY CARTWHEEL
AFTER THE FUNERAL TODAY

224
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
AND JUST SAY HELLO TO--
TO FIONA AND LEROY.

225
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU HEARD ON THE RADIO

226
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
FIONA WAS
GETTING MARRIED.

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
GETTING, NOT GOT.

228
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
THERE'S STILL TIME.

229
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

230
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
LOOK, WHAT
IN THE SAM HILL

231
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
WAS FIONA DOING
ON THE RADIO

232
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
ANNOUNCING
SHE WAS GETTING MARRIED?

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
SHE WAS ON A.M. BALTIMORE,

234
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
YOU KNOW,
THE MEL SPRUCE SHOW?

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
PEOPLE WERE CALLING IN
TALKING ABOUT WHAT
MAKES A GOOD MARRIAGE.

236
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
FIONA STUCKEY MORAN
SURE QUALIFIES
AS AN EXPERT.

237
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
WELL, I KNOW...

238
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
BUT WE SHOULD STILL
KEEP AN EYE ON LEROY.

239
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
YOU NAME A GIRL
"LEROY,"

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
SHE BETTER DEVELOP
A SENSE OF TAKING
CARE OF HERSELF.

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
JUST DROP BY
FOR A LITTLE VISIT.

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
ANN LANDERS
SAYS DROP-IN VISITS
ARE INCONSIDERATE.

243
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
IF YOU'D
MARRIED ANN LANDERS,

244
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
YOU COULD
HAVE LIVED A LIFE
OF UTTER CORRECTNESS.

245
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
"NELL'S CAFE, 1 MILE."

246
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
THEY'LL
HAVE A MAP THERE.

247
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'M STARVED.

248
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
YOU CAN GET
SOMETHING TO EAT

249
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
WHILE I
LOOK AT THE MAP.

250
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I DON'T WANT
SOMETHING TO EAT.

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
YOU SAID
YOU WERE STARVING.

252
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'M ON A DIET.
I JUST WANT A SNACK.

253
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I HATE HOW YOU TRY
TO UNDERMINE MY DIETS.

254
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
YOU DON'T NEED TO DIET.

255
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
LOOK JUST RIGHT TO ME.

256
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
YOU MEAN,
JUST RIGHT CONSIDERING.

257
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
UH-OH. HMM.

258
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
DO YOU HAVE
ANY KIND OF SALADS?

259
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
OH, WE DON'T SERVE
NO SALADS, HON.

260
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
ALL'S I CAN OFFER YOU

261
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
IS THE LETTUCE AND
TOMATO OFF THE BLTs.

262
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
NO. THIS IS FINE.
COFFEE'S FINE.

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
MMM. YOU KNOW I MIGHT
JUST HAVE A PACKAGE

264
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
OF THE TACO CHIPS
ON THE RACK OVER THERE.

265
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
OF COURSE
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T.

266
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
MAGGIE...

267
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
THAT'S SHORT FOR
MARGARET, RIGHT?

268
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
YES.

269
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
JUST PLAIN OLD MABEL.

270
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
WHAT YOU SEE
IS WHAT YOU GET.

271
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
IT WAS
MY THIRD GRADE TEACHER

272
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
STARTED
CALLING ME MAGGIE

273
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
'CAUSE SHE DIDN'T CARE
TOO MUCH FOR THE IRISH.

274
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
THEN WHEN SHE FOUND OUT
THAT I LIKED IT,

275
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
IT REALLY TORE HER UP.

276
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOU NEED TO LOSE A POUND,

277
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
HONEST, MAGGIE.

278
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
OH, THAT'S WHAT IRA SAYS.

279
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
HE LIKES ME
THE WAY I AM NOW.

280
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
MY DOCTOR MADE
ME LOSE 20 POUNDS,

281
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
ELSE HE SAID MY FEET
AND MY ANKLES
WOULDN'T HOLD UP.

282
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I WEAR THE BEST
NURSE'S SHOES
I CAN GET,

283
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
BUT COME
QUITTING TIME,

284
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I AM NUMB
FROM THE KNEES DOWN.

285
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
THAT IS THE HARDEST
WORK THERE IS.

286
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
YEAH.

287
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
OUR DAUGHTER DAISY
DOES WAITRESSING.

288
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
COURSE IT WAS
JUST SUMMER WORK.

289
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
SHE'S GOING OFF
TO COLLEGE TOMORROW.

290
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
COLLEGE?

291
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
A SMARTY, HUH?

292
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
WELL, I DON'T KNOW,

293
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
BUT SHE DID
GET A FULL SCHOLARSHIP.

294
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
WANT SOME OF THESE?

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
OH, THANK YOU.

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
ALL'S I HAD IS BOYS.

297
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
THEY WAS DUMB AS SHRUBS.

298
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
OH, WHAT I WOULDN'T
GIVE FOR A DAUGHTER.

299
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
DAUGHTERS CAN HAVE
THEIR DRAWBACKS, TOO.

300
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
MINE HAS JUST CHANGED
OUT OF ALL RECOGNITION.

301
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
IRA SAYS IT'S JUST
BECAUSE SHE'S GROWING UP,

302
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
BUT SEEMS LIKE THAT NOW

303
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
EVERY SINGLE THING
THAT WE DO IS WRONG.

304
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE
SAID THE OTHER DAY?

305
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I WAS TESTING OUT THIS--
THIS TUNA CASSEROLE,

306
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
SO I SERVED IT
FOR SUPPER,

307
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
AND I SAID TO HER,
"ISN'T THIS DELICIOUS?

308
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
NOW, TELL ME HONESTLY
WHAT YOU THINK."

309
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
YEAH?

310
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
SO DAISY SAID,

311
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
"MOM, WAS THERE
A CERTAIN CONSCIOUS POINT
IN YOUR LIFE

312
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
WHEN YOU DECIDED TO SETTLE
FOR BEING ORDINARY?"

313
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
OH!

314
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
FOR GOD'S SAKES,
MAGGIE.

315
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
WELL, I'M SORRY.
IT JUST GOT TO ME

316
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
BECAUSE TO ME
I AM NOT ORDINARY.

317
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
YOU AREN'T.
YOU TELL HER, HONEY.

318
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I SAID TO BOBBY,
OUR OLDEST?

319
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
IT WAS OVER A TUNA DISH,
COME TO THINK OF IT.

320
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
AIN'T THAT A COINCIDENCE?

321
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
WELL, HE ANNOUNCES,
"I AM SICK TO DEATH
OF FOODS

322
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
THAT'S MINGLED TOGETHER."

323
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I SAID, "YOU
JUST LEAVE THIS TABLE.

324
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
YOU JUST
LEAVE THIS HOUSE."

325
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
HE THOUGHT I
WAS RUNNING MY MOUTH.

326
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
HE KNEW I WAS SERIOUS

327
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
WHEN I PUT HIS CLOTHES
ON HIS CAR'S HOOD.

328
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
MMM.

329
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
[DOORBELL JINGLES]

330
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I DON'T KNOW.

331
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
THINGS JUST--JUST...

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
CLOSED IN ON ME TODAY.

333
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO A FUNERAL.

334
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
SOMEBODY YOU THOUGHT
WOULD LIVE FOREVER.

335
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
OH, MAGGIE.

336
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
WELL, YOU ARE HOLDING UP
VERY WELL, I'D SAY.

337
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
THEN I HEARD THAT
MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW

338
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
IS GOING
TO GET REMARRIED.

339
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
WELL, HOW
CAN SHE DO THAT?

340
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
AHH, IS IT YOUR SON
THAT PASSED ON?

341
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
OH, NO, NO, NO.

342
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
MY EX-DAUGHTER-IN-LAW,
I SHOULD HAVE SAID.

343
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
YOU SEE,
JESSE NEVER, NEVER

344
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
WOULD HAVE DROPPED
OUT OF SCHOOL

345
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
IF IT HADN'T BEEN

869
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I'M GOING
TO GET HIS LICENSE.

870
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
MM-HMM. I GOT IT.

871
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
YOU PULLED YOUR LAST
FAST ONE, MISTER.

872
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
MAGGIE.

873
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
WELL, PASS HIM.

874
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
PASS HIM.

875
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
IT'S DANGEROUS
TO FOLLOW BEHIND

876
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
A CRAZY MAN LIKE THAT.

877
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
WATCH THIS.

878
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
YOUR WHEEL.

879
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
YOUR FRONT WHEEL
IS FALLING OFF.

880
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
WELL, NOW WHY
DID YOU GO AND DO THAT?

881
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
WELL, NOW WHAT?

882
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
OH, IRA.

883
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
HE DIDN'T MEAN TO
RUN US OFF THE ROAD.

884
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
HE PROBABLY
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

885
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
DID YOU SEE HIM?

886
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
HE HAD THIS KIND
OLD FACE,

887
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
AND WHEN I YELLED AT HIM
ABOUT THE WHEEL,

888
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
HE LOOKED SCARED.

889
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
HE TIPPED HIS HAT,

890
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
JUST LIKE
MY GRANDFATHER USED TO.

891
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

892
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
HE THINKS
WE'RE PLAYING A TRICK,

893
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
THAT WE'RE RACIST,

894
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
AND WE LIED TO HIM.

895
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
WE HAVE TO
GO TELL HIM.

896
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
THAT NICE FACE
WILL HAUNT ME
IF WE DON'T.

897
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
JUST THINK.

898
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
ALL UP AND DOWN
THIS HIGHWAY,

899
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
OTHER COUPLES ARE OUT
FOR A WEEKEND DRIVE,

900
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
TRAVELING FROM
POINT "A" TO POINT "B,"

901
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
NO DETOURS,

902
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
STOPPING AT SOME
NICE INN FOR LUNCH.

903
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
OH, I KNEW
YOU COULDN'T
BE HEARTLESS.

904
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
YOU NEED SOME HELP?

905
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
IT'S MY WHEEL.

906
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
LADY UP THE ROAD
A WAYS POINTED OUT

907
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
MY WHEEL
IS FALLING OFF.

908
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
OH, THAT WAS ME.

909
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I'M MAGGIE MORAN.

910
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
THIS IS MY HUSBAND IRA.

911
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
YES. MY...

912
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
MY NAME IS
MR. DANIEL OTIS,
MA'AM,

913
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
AND I CERTAINLY
WANT TO THANK YOU.

914
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I COULD'VE DROVE
TO MY DEATH.

915
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
OH, WELL...

916
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I--I THINK
I MIGHT'VE BEEN MISTAKEN.

917
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
IT SEEMS SOLID TO ME.

918
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I THINK IT'S O.K.

919
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
OH, WELL,
IT SURELY SEEMS FINE

920
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
WHEN THE CAR'S
SITTING STOCK STILL
LIKE IT IS.

921
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I MEAN WHEN YOU WERE
BACK ON THE ROAD.

922
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
OH, NO.

923
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
NO, I COULD
FEEL IT WOBBLE
ALL RIGHT,

924
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
ONCE YOU CALLED
MY ATTENTION TO IT.

925
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
YOU COULD?

926
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
UH, LOOK.

927
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
WHY DON'T I JUST GET IN,

928
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
DRIVE IT AHEAD
A FEW FEET

929
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
AND YOU TWO
KEEP AN EYE ON IT, HUH?

930
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
YOU'LL SEE IT'S O.K.

931
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
OH, NO. I DON'T
WANT TO PUT YOU
IN MORTAL DANGER.

932
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
UH, NO DANGER.

933
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
BELIEVE ME.

934
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
YOU SEE,

935
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I HAD THIS KIND OF...

936
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
LIKE A...

937
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
A MIRAGE...

938
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
WHEN WE DROVE
PAST YOUR CAR.

939
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
[ENGINE STARTS]

940
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
AND I THOUGHT THAT
I SAW YOUR WHEEL WOBBLE

941
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
A LITTLE BIT.

942
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
BUT THEN
IN THE NEXT INSTANT,

943
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I SAID, "NO,

944
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I THINK
I MUST'VE IMAGINED THAT."

945
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
DIDN'T I, IRA?

946
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
UH-HUH.

947
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
JUST ASK IRA.

948
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
THERE'S ALL KINDS
OF EXPLANATIONS

949
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
WHY YOU MIGHT'VE
SEEN IT WOBBLE.

950
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
OH, YEAH.

951
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
OH, YES, CERTAINLY.
CERTAINLY.

952
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
THE HEAT...

953
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
HEAT WAVES RIPPLING UP
FROM THE PAVEMENT.

954
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
UH...

955
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

956
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
MIGHT'VE BEEN
A SIGN, TOO.

957
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
A SIGN?

958
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
MIGHT'VE BEEN THE LORD

959
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
TRYING TO WARN ME.

960
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
SOUND AS A DOLLAR TO ME.

961
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
WELL, THAT'S...

962
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
THAT'S WHAT
I WOULD'VE SWORE
DRIVING HER,

963
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
BUT, NOW,
THE LADY'S
RIGHT.

964
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I COULD SEE IT
WOBBLE ALL RIGHT
ENOUGH.

965
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I THINK I SAW IT
WOBBLE A LITTLE BIT,
TOO.

966
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
EXCUSE ME?

967
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I CAN'T HELP IT, IRA.

968
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I DID SEE IT WOBBLE.

969
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
IT LOOKED
KIND OF SQUASHY, TOO.

970
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
NOW, LOOK HERE, MAGGIE--

971
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
FOLKS, UH...

972
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I DON'T DESERVE
PROPERTIES

973
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
LOOKING OVER ME
LIKE THIS.

974
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
YOU PEOPLE

975
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
ARE A GODSEND.

976
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I MEAN,
ANYBODY ELSE

977
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
WOULD LET ME
JUST DRIVE ON
TO MY DEATH.

978
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
PROVIDENCE
AND A GOOD LUG WRENCH

979
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
IS ALL WE NEED
IN A CASE LIKE THIS.

980
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
WE'LL JUST TIGHTEN UP
THOSE LUG NUTS,

981
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
AND YOU'D BE
ON YOUR WAY,
SAFE AND SOUND.

982
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
OH, SHOOT.

983
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I...

984
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I JUST REMEMBERED.

985
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
SOMEBODY STOLE
THAT LUG WRENCH

986
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
OUT OF MY TRUNK
A WHILE BACK.

987
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
HOW DID
THEY FIND IT?

988
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

989
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I SURE ADMIRE A LADY

990
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
WHO COULD JEST
IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY.

991
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
DON'T YOU?

992
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
OH, YEAH.

993
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
YEAH.

994
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
WELL, I'LL JUST, UH...

995
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
GET THE LUG WRENCH
OUT OF OUR CAR.

996
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
OH, IRA,
I DON'T THINK SO.

997
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
WHAT?

998
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
YOU REMEMBER WHEN
I HAD THAT FLAT
LAST MONTH,

999
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
AND THAT YOUNG FELLA
WAS NICE ENOUGH
TO CHANGE THE--

1000
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
BUT HE WASN'T
NICE ENOUGH

1001
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
TO PUT THE JACK
AND THE LUG WRENCH BACK?

1002
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I DROVE RIGHT BACK
THE NEXT MORNING,

1003
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
BUT THEY WERE GONE.

1004
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
YOU CAN'T LEAVE VALUABLES
BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

1005
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
WHAT IF I WERE
TO TELL YOU THAT, UH...

1006
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
WE LIED TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR WHEEL
BACK THERE,

1007
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
THAT WE WERE
JUST MAD AT YOU
BECAUSE YOU...

1008
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
WERE DRIVING
ERRATICALLY?

1009
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
OH.

1010
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I UNDERSTAND.

1011
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
YOU'VE BEEN KIND ENOUGH

1012
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
TO COME BACK
AND WARN ME,

1013
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
BUT, UH, WHY DON'T
Y'ALL JUST GO ON NOW,

1014
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
AND I'LL HITCH A RIDE
TO BUFORD?

1015
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I GOT A NEPHEW WHO WORKS
IN A GAS STATION.

1016
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
HE CAN COME BACK
AND FIX ME UP.

1017
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
GO HOME.

1018
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I'LL CATCH ME A RIDE.

1019
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
YOU'LL DO
NO SUCH THING.

1020
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
WE'LL--WE'LL
GIVE YOU A RIDE.

1021
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
WHERE IS BUFORD?

1022
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
THERE'S ONE IN CANADA,
I THINK.

1023
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
YOU FOLKS
DON'T HAVE TO WAIT.

1024
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
HE SAID
LeMONT IS DUE BACK
WITH THE WRECKER

1025
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
ANY TIME NOW.

1026
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
A FEW MINUTES
WON'T CHANGE OUR LIVES,

1027
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
WILL IT, IRA?

1028
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
WE'LL WAIT WITH YOU.

1029
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
DO THEY HAVE
A SNACK MACHINE
INSIDE?

1030
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
YOU MEAN CHIPS
AND THINGS LIKE THAT?

1031
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
YEAH.

1032
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
OH, YEAH.

1033
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
I THINK I'D LIKE
SOME PRETZELS.

1034
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
WHAT CAN I GET
YOU TWO?

1035
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
WHAT, ON MY DIET?

1036
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
MR. OTIS,
WOULD YOU LIKE SOMETHING?

1037
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,000
YOU KNOW,

1038
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I--I WAS
THINKING PRETZELS,

1039
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
EVEN WHEN I WAS DRIVING.

1040
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
AIN'T THAT A COINCIDENCE,
THOUGH?

1041
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
UH, PRETZELS IT IS.

1042
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
HA HA.

1043
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
WELL...

1044
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
SO...

1045
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
HOW ABOUT WE GO
SET A SPELL?

1046
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
WERE YOU
ON YOUR WAY HOME

1047
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
WHEN YOU
HAD THE TROUBLE
WITH THE WHEEL?

1048
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
NO.

1049
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
WELL, YOU KNOW,
LIKE I SAID.

1050
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I'VE BEEN STAYING
WITH MY SISTER LORENE
THE LAST FEW DAYS.

1051
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
ME AND MY WIFE DELUTH...

1052
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
HAD A BIG FALLING OUT.

1053
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
OHH.

1054
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
OH, THAT'S A SHAME,
MR. OTIS...

1055
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
DANIEL.

1056
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
DANIEL.

1057
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
YOU KNOW...

1058
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
SHE GOT MAD AT ME

1059
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
FOR SOMETHING
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE DONE

1060
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
IN HER DREAM.

1061
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
OH, WELL,
I KNOW HOW THAT IS.

1062
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,000
YOU KNOW,
YOU WAKE UP
IN THE MORNING,

1063
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
AND IT SEEMS
SO REAL.

1064
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
YEAH, WELL, I GUESS.

1065
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
SHE WAS MAD ENOUGH
TO KILL ME WHEN I WOKE UP.

1066
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
SH-SHE SAID
SHE CAUGHT ME

1067
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,000
WALKING ON HER
NEEDLEPOINT.

1068
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
NO.

1069
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
SHE SAID,
"YOU'RE THE MOST
STUBBORN OLD MAN

1070
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I EVER KNEW,
DANIEL OTIS."

1071
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
50 YEARS MARRIED,

1072
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
AND THAT WAS
THE MADDEST

1073
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I HAVE EVER SEEN HER.

1074
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
50 YEARS.

1075
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
CONGRATULATIONS.

1076
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
MMM.

1077
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
THANK YOU.

1078
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
LeMONT...

1079
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
YOU KNOW,
WHO WE'RE WAITING FOR?

1080
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
HE'S DIVORCED.

1081
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
MY SISTER FLORENCE'S
GIRL SALLY,

1082
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
SHE'S DIVORCED.

1083
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I DON'T KNOW
WHY THEY EVEN BOTHER
GETTING MARRIED ANYMORE.

1084
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
MY SON JESSE'S DIVORCED.

1085
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
OHH.

1086
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
MAKES YOU SO SAD,
DON'T IT?

1087
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
OH, IRA...

1088
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
MR. OTIS' WIFE
IS MAD AT HIM

1089
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
FOR SOMETHING HE DID
IN HER DREAM.

1090
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
HE WALKED
ON HER NEEDLEPOINT.

1091
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
YOU DON'T SAY?

1092
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
WELL, I THINK
I'M GOING TO GO

1093
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
AND GET US
ALL A DRINK.

1094
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
THEY HAVE DIET DRINKS
IN THERE?

1095
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
BIG OLD REACH-IN COOLER
OUT THERE.

1096
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
OH.

1097
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
THANK YOU.

1098
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
THE MISSIS
WAS TELLING ME
ABOUT YOUR SON.

1099
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
SAD,
THE YOUNG ONES
TODAY.

1100
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
YES, IT IS.

1101
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
MMM.

1102
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
MUSICIAN...

1103
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
HMM HMM HMM.

1104
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
SHE SAID.

1105
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
MUSICIAN WHO CAN'T
CARRY A TUNE.

1106
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
OH, MY.

1107
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
NOW, THAT IS
TOO BAD.

1108
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
OH, I GUESS
I'VE HEARD WORSE
THAN JESSE

1109
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
WHO GOT PAID
A LOT MORE.

1110
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
ISN'T THAT A FACT?

1111
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
YOU KNOW, I HATE TO
TURN ON MY RADIO.

1112
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
OH, THEY JUST
DON'T MAKE THEM

1113
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
LIKE NAT KING COLE
NOWADAYS.

1114
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
NO, THEY SURELY DON'T.

1115
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
YOU KNOW,

1116
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I SHOULD STAY AWAY
FROM THIS SALT,

1117
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
BUT I GUESS
IT'S KIND OF
AN OCCASION,

1118
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
AIN'T IT?

1119
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU DO, IRA?

1120
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I MEAN,
IF I CAN ASK.

1121
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I'M A FRAMER.

1122
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
OH...
HOUSES AND SUCH.

1123
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
NO.
PICTURES AND SUCH--

1124
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
PAINTINGS,

1125
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
DOCUMENTS.

1126
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
MMM.

1127
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
EVEN NEEDLEPOINT.

1128
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
WHAT IN SAM HILL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1129
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
WHERE'S YOUR CAR?

1130
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
WOBBLY WHEEL.

1131
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
THESE KIND FOLKS
BROUGHT ME HERE FOR HELP.

1132
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
WE JUST HAPPENED
TO BE PASSING BY.

1133
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
IT WAS THE MISSIS
WHO CAUGHT ON TO IT.

1134
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
SHE LEANED OUT HER WINDOW
AND CALLED,

1135
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
"YOUR WHEEL
IS FALLING OFF."

1136
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I'D OFFER YOU
MY HAND,

1137
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
BUT THIS SODA
JUST FIZZED
ALL OVER IT.

1138
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
IT WAS HER WHO
FIRST SAW IT WAS LOOSE.

1139
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
WELL, IT WASN'T
REALLY LOOSE.

1140
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I JUST
MADE THAT UP.

1141
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
SAY WHAT?

1142
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I FIBBED.

1143
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
YOU MEAN
YOU LIED TO HIM?

1144
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
LeMONT,
I'LL TELL YOU
THE TRUTH.

1145
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I DO BELIEVE,
NOW THAT I
THINK BACK ON IT,

1146
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
THAT WHEEL HASN'T
BEEN ACTING RIGHT

1147
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
FOR SOME DAYS NOW.

1148
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
DIDN'T I SAY
YOU OUGHT TO
GIVE UP DRIVING?

1149
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
DIDN'T FLORENCE BEG YOU
TO TURN IN YOUR LICENSE?

1150
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
SEE, NOW,
IF YOU STAYED HOME
WITH AUNT DELUTH,

1151
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
NONE OF THIS
WOULD BE HAPPENING.

1152
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I--I DON'T WANT
TO BE ANY TROUBLE--

1153
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
MAN, SEE,
YOU BEEN MARRIED
50-SOME YEARS,

1154
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
AND HALF THE TIME,

1155
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
YOU BOTH FUSSING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

1156
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
ONE OF YOU
ALWAYS MOVING OUT.

1157
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
SHOOT, MAN,
THE LAST TIME
YOU BOTH MOVED OUT

1158
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
AND LEFT THAT
PERFECTLY GOOD HOUSE
STANDING EMPTY.

1159
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
WELL, AT LEAST
I'M STILL MARRIED,

1160
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
UNLIKE CERTAIN OTHERS
I COULD NAME.

1161
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
DRIVING ALL OVER
THE COUNTRY

1162
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
LIKE SOME OLD HIPPIE
IN THAT OLD CAR.

1163
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
IF THERE'S ANY EXPENSE--

1164
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
NO, THERE AIN'T
GOING TO BE
NO EXPENSE.

1165
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
NOW, LeMONT
IS FAMILY.

1166
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
AIN'T THAT RIGHT,
LeMONT?

1167
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
YES, SIR.

1168
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
COME ON
AND GET IN THE TRUCK.

1169
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
AS IF I AIN'T GOT
NOTHING ELSE BETTER TO DO
WITH MY TIME.

1170
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
BOY SURE IS
CRANKY.

1171
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I DON'T KNOW
WHO HE TAKE AFTER.

1172
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
BUT DON'T Y'ALL
PAY HIM NO NEVERMIND.

1173
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
HE JUST WANTS TO
RANT AND CARRY ON.

1174
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I WANT TO THANK
BOTH OF YOU.

1175
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
WELL...

1176
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
AND I HOPE
THINGS WORK OUT
WITH DELUTH.

1177
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
OH, THEY ALWAYS DO...

1178
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
SOONER OR LATER.

1179
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
BYE-BYE.

1180
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
BYE-BYE, NOW.

1181
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
[SIGHS]

1182
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
WELL...

1183
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
SO ANYHOW...

1184
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
MAGGIE.

1185
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY IT.

1186
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
SPRUCE GUM.

1187
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
WHAT?

1188
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
SPRUCE GUM.

1189
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
THAT'S THE TURNOFF
TO CARTWHEEL...

1190
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
ACCORDING TO
DANIEL THERE.

1191
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
THAT IS, IF YOU
STILL WANT TO SEE
FIONA AND LEROY.

1192
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
THAT'S IT.

1193
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
YOU SEE?
THIS WAS MEANT
TO HAPPEN.

1194
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
OH, IRA.

1195
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
OH, WAIT.

1196
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I GOT LIPSTICK ON YOU.
I BETTER GET IT OFF.

1197
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
JUST LEAVE IT THERE.

1198
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
WOULDN'T HURT FIONA
TO SEE THAT
YOU DON'T GET PETRIFIED

1199
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
JUST BECAUSE
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR 30 YEARS.

1200
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
29.

1201
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
IT JUST
SEEMS LONGER.

1202
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
WHAT?

1203
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
IT WAS A JOKE,
MY DOVE.

1204
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
THEY HAVE THE NERVE
TO CALL THIS
A BOULEVARD.

1205
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
WE'RE JUST DROPPING BY
TO SAY HELLO, ALL RIGHT?

1206
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
NO RAKING OVER THE PAST.

1207
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
PROMISE ME,
OR I DRIVE RIGHT BY.

1208
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
THIS WHOLE THING
IS A MISTAKE.

1209
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
DON'T DRAG IT OUT.

1210
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
DO I LOOK OLD, IRA?

1211
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
DO I?
TELL ME.

1212
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

1213
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
THANKS A WHOLE HEAP.

1214
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
WHOA, THERE!

1215
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
OHH...

1216
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
LEROY.

1217
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
OH, THAT SWEET
DEAR LITTLE THING.

1218
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
IRA, SHE LOOKS
SO UNDERNOURISHED.

1219
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
SHE LOOKS
PART DOBERMAN TO ME.

1220
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
OHH.

1221
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
AHH.

1222
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
WELL...

1223
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU REMEMBER ME.

1224
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
WELL, I'M YOUR GRANDMA.

1225
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
MY GRANDMA
IS AT THE STORE SHOPPING
THIS VERY MINUTE.

1226
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
WELL, I'M
YOUR OTHER GRANDMA.

1227
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
GRANDMA MORAN...

1228
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
UH, FROM YOUR FATHER'S
SIDE OF THE FAMILY.

1229
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
AND THIS IS
YOUR GRANDPA.

1230
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
OH.

1231
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
OH.

1232
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
YOU DON'T
RECOGNIZE ME, HMM?

1233
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
WELL...

1234
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I WAS STANDING BY
WHEN YOU WERE BORN.

1235
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
AND YOU SPENT
THE FIRST EIGHT
OR NINE MONTHS

1236
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
OF YOUR LIFE
WITH US.

1237
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
WHY?

1238
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
WELL, BECAUSE YOUR MOMMY
AND YOUR DADDY

1239
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
WERE STAYING WITH US THEN.

1240
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
AND WE BROUGHT YOU
A KITTEN...

1241
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY
WHEN YOU WERE 1...

1242
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
THIS LITTLE
STRIPED KITTEN.

1243
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I DON'T REMEMBER.

1244
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

1245
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
YOU WERE SO ALLERGIC,
WE HAD TO TAKE IT BACK.

1246
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
WE TOOK IT TO BALTIMORE.

1247
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
DO YOU STILL HAVE IT?

1248
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
I'M NOT
SO ALLERGIC ANYMORE.

1249
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
NO.

1250
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
UNFORTUNATELY,

1251
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
THE POOR
SWEET LITTLE THING
WAS RUN OVER

1252
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
VERY SHORTLY
THEREAFTER.

1253
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
THAT'S WHY
I DON'T LIKE
BALTIMORE.

1254
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
TOO MUCH TRAFFIC.

1255
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

1256
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
IS YOUR MOMMY HOME?

1257
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
MA!

1258
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
UH...

1259
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
WELL...

1260
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
HI.

1261
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
SURPRISE.

1262
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I HEARD YOU
ON THE RADIO
THIS MORNING,

1263
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
SO WE--

1264
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
WE THOUGHT
WE'D STOP BY

1265
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
AND WISH YOU WELL.

1266
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
WELL...

1267
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
WELL, ACTUALLY,

1268
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
WE WERE IN
THIS NECK OF THE WOODS,

1269
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
UH, FOR
MAX GILL'S FUNERAL.

1270
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
YOU REMEMBER MAX GILL.

1271
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
MY FRIEND SERENA'S
HUSBAND MAX.

1272
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
WELL, ANYWAY,

1273
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
HE--HE DIED OF CANCER,

1274
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
SO I SAID
WHY DON'T WE STOP BY
AND VISIT FIONA?

1275
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
UH, THE RADIO?

1276
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
UH, A.M. BALTIMORE.

1277
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
IT FEELS FUNNY
TO SEE YOU.

1278
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
FUNNY?

1279
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I--I MEAN...

1280
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
UH, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME INSIDE?

1281
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
OH, YEAH.

1282
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
WELL, JUST FOR A MINUTE.

1283
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
WE'VE GOT A MINUTE,
HAVEN'T WE?

1284
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
UH, YEAH,
JUST ABOUT.

1285
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
WELL...

1286
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
WE WERE SO SURPRISED
TO HEAR ABOUT
YOUR WEDDING PLANS.

1287
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE A JOKE?

1288
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
WELL, I...

1289
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I--I COULD'VE SWORN
I HEARD YOU SAY THAT

1290
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
THIS MORNING
ON THE RADIO.

1291
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
WPED.

1292
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,000
YOU KNOW,

1293
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
THE MEL SPRUCE
CALL-IN SHOW.

1294
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
THEY WERE DISCUSSING
WHAT IT TAKES

1295
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
FOR AN IDEAL MARRIAGE.

1296
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
WELL, IT SURE
WASN'T ME.

1297
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
THE ONLY STATION
I LISTEN TO

1298
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
IS WZBN.

1299
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
WELL, CAN YOU
IMAGINE THAT?

1300
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
WELL...

1301
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I--I--I
COULD'VE SWORN
IT WAS YOU.

1302
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I ALWAYS
THOUGHT YOU HAD
SUCH A NICE VOICE.

1303
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I'D HARDLY
SAY THAT.

1304
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
WELL, SO, UH...

1305
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
HOW'S LITTLE DAISY?

1306
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
OH, SHE'S NOT
SO LITTLE ANYMORE.

1307
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
SHE'S HEADING OFF
TO COLLEGE TOMORROW.

1308
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,000
WELL, I'M IN
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOL MYSELF

1309
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
RIGHT NOW.

1310
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
OH,
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

1311
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
WHAT KIND OF SCHOOL?

1312
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
ELECTROLYSIS.

1313
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
OH, I THINK
THAT'S LOVELY.

1314
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
THE BEAUTY PARLOR
WHERE I WORK

1315
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
AS A SHAMPOO TECHNICIAN
IS PAYING FOR THE COURSE--

1316
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
TUITION AND SUPPLIES.

1317
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
THEY WANT THEIR OWN
LICENSED OPERATOR.

1318
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
OH, IRA,

1319
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL?

1320
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
I COULD HARDLY
BELIEVE IT.

1321
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
SHOW THEM
YOUR PRACTICE KIT, MA.

1322
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
OH, OH, YES.

1323
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
SHOW ME.

1324
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
SHOW US.

1325
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE THAT.

1326
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
WE DO.

1327
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,000
ABSOLUTELY.

1328
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
WELL, THEN,
WAIT A SEC.

1329
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
THEY'RE GOING
TO HANG A SIGN
IN THE WINDOW,

1330
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
PROFESSIONALLY PAINTED
WITH MA'S NAME ON IT.

1331
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?

1332
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
IT'S GENUINE SCIENCE
MA SAYS.

1333
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
TRAINED EXPERTS

1334
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
TO TEACH YOU
HOW IT'S DONE.

1335
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,000
UH, FIRST WE PRACTICE
WITH A DUMMY INSTRUMENT.

1336
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
AHEM.

1337
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
WE HAVE TO WORK ON
GETTING THE ANGLE

1338
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
EXACTLY RIGHT.

1339
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
AHEM.

1340
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
SEE, UH...

1341
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
YOU TRAVEL

1342
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
INTO THE FOLLICLE...

1343
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
EASY.

1344
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
EASY.

1345
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
OH!

1346
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
IF THIS WERE
A REAL PERSON,

1347
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I WOULD'VE BEEN
LEANING ON HER EYEBALL.

1348
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SMUSH YOU.

1349
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
DOES THE SCHOOL
SUPPLY THE SPONGES?

1350
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
YES, IT'S INCLUDED
IN THE TUITION.

1351
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
TELL HIM
ABOUT THE SIGN, MA,

1352
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
WITH YOUR NAME
PROFESSIONALLY
PAINTED ON IT.

1353
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
WELL...

1354
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
WHEN I GRADUATE,

1355
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I'LL HAVE A SIGN READING,

1356
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
"FIONA MORAN,

1357
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
"LICENSED ELECTROLOGIST,

1358
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
PAINLESS REMOVAL
OF SUPERFLUOUS HAIR."

1359
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
FIONA MORAN.

1360
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I LIKE THAT.

1361
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THERE WAS SO MUCH
SUPERFLUOUS HAIR AROUND.

1362
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
OH, THERE'S A BIG FUTURE
IN THE BUSINESS

1363
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
THE WAY FASHIONS
ARE GOING TO THE SKIMPY.

1364
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
THERE'S A SMALL FORTUNE
IN UNWANTED HAIR.

1365
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
YOU GOT A BALL
TO GO WITH THAT GLOVE?

1366
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
WHAT DO YOU SAY
LET'S GO OUTSIDE?

1367
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
I'LL THROW YOU A FEW.

1368
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I'LL CHECK
YOUR STUFF OUT.

1369
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
ISN'T THAT SWEET?

1370
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
SHE'LL WEAR HIM OUT
AND LEAVE HIM FOR DEAD.

1371
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
DOES SHE EVER
MENTION HER DADDY?

1372
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
NO MORE THAN
HE MENTIONS HER,
I'LL BET.

1373
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
WELL, TELL ME.

1374
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
DO YOU HAVE
ANYBODY IN PARTICULAR
THESE DAYS, FIONA?

1375
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
OH, SHOOT.

1376
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I JUST BARELY
GET TO DATE AT ALL.

1377
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
THERE WAS
THIS ONE GUY--
MARK DERBY.

1378
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I GAVE HIM UP
LIKE LIGHTNING

1379
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
WHEN HE GOT SO NASTY

1380
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
JUST 'CAUSE
I BASHED IN HIS CAR.

1381
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
YOU WERE VERY WISE.

1382
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I MEAN,
JUST A LITTLE BASH.

1383
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I TOTALED IT.

1384
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
JESSE DOESN'T HAVE
ANYBODY IN PARTICULAR
EITHER, YOU MIGHT SAY.

1385
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D SAY

1386
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
HE EVER HAD ANYONE
IN PARTICULAR.

1387
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
HEY, HOW ABOUT A BEER?

1388
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
OH, I'D LOVE A BEER.

1389
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
ONLY THING WE GOT
IS LIGHT.

1390
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
IS THAT O.K.?

1391
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
OH, THAT'S PERFECT.

1392
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
I'M ON A DIET.

1393
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
OHH.

1394
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I WONDER IF
CLAUDINE AND PETER
EVER GOT MARRIED.

1395
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
WHO?

1396
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
YOU REMEMBER.

1397
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
THE--THE SOAP OPERA
WE USED TO WATCH.

1398
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
HIS SISTER...

1399
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
NATASHA...

1400
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
WAS ALWAYS TRYING
TO SPLIT THEM UP.

1401
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
OH, LORD. NATASHA.

1402
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
SHE WAS ONE MEAN LADY.

1403
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
THEN YOU LEFT US.

1404
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,000
YOU KNOW, AT FIRST
I COULD NOT BELIEVE

1405
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,000
YOU WERE GONE
FOR GOOD.

1406
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I'D COME HOME FROM WORK
AT THE NURSING HOME,

1407
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
AND I'D SWITCH ON THE TV

1408
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING
TO CLAUDINE AND PETER

1409
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
SO I COULD FILL YOU IN
WHEN YOU GOT BACK.

1410
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
ARE YOU STILL WORKING
AT THAT, UH...

1411
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
SOMETHING WILLOW...

1412
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
MM-HMM.

1413
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
BUT I--I WORK
SHORT HOURS,

1414
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
SO, UH, IN...
JUST IN CASE, UH...

1415
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
LEROY EVER WANTED
TO COME AND STAY,

1416
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I'M ALWAYS HOME
BY THE TIME
SCHOOL IS OUT.

1417
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.

1418
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
LOW, INSIDE.

1419
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
ARE YOU REALLY
MY GRANDFATHER?

1420
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
YEP.

1421
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
MY OTHER
GRANDFATHER'S DEAD.

1422
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
WELL, THIS ONE AIN'T.

1423
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
AIN'T NO SUCH WORD
AS AIN'T.

1424
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
THERE AIN'T?

1425
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
HOW COME I DON'T LOOK
ANYTHING LIKE YOU?

1426
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
AH, TAKES A LONG TIME
TO GET THIS UGLY.

1427
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I SPENT HOURS
IN THE BEAUTY PARLOR

1428
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
GETTING READY
FOR THAT DAY

1429
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
BECAUSE YOU PROMISED
HE WAS COMING.

1430
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
TO THIS DAY,
IT MAKES ME JUST BOIL.

1431
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
WELL, DON'T THINK
I DIDN'T TELL HIM

1432
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
WHEN WE GOT BACK HOME.

1433
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
OH, SURE.

1434
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
HE CALLED ME
BECAUSE HE FELT
SORRY FOR ME

1435
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
BECAUSE LIKE A FOOL,

1436
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I'D GONE TO
SO MUCH TROUBLE

1437
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,000
THINKING
I WOULD SEE HIM.

1438
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
THAT IS THE TROUBLE
WITH THE TWO OF YOU.

1439
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
YOU BOTH HAVE SUCH
WARM FEELINGS
FOR EACH OTHER,

1440
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
BUT THEY DON'T
GET TURNED ON
AT THE SAME TIME.

1441
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
JESSE MORAN?

1442
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
FEELINGS?

1443
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I WISH
YOU COULD'VE SEEN HIM

1444
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
THE WAY I DID
THAT DAY,

1445
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
LIKE HE'D LOST THE WORLD.

1446
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
GOOD.

1447
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
OH, JESSE IS...

1448
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
IS DIFFERENT.

1449
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
SURE.

1450
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
WELL, HE REMEMBERS.

1451
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
FIONA...

1452
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
DO YOU KNOW

1453
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
THAT HIS MOST
CHERISHED BELONGING

1454
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
IS THAT LITTLE...

1455
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
LITTLE TORTOISE-SHELL
SOAP DISH OF YOURS?

1456
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
MY WHAT?

1457
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
WELL, YOU KNOW
HOW PEOPLE SAY THAT--
THAT CERTAIN SMELLS

1458
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
SEEM TO STIR UP
OLD MEMORIES.

1459
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS
WITH THAT PRETTY
LITTLE SOAP BOX

1460
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
BECAUSE HE HAS KEPT IT
ALL THIS TIME.

1461
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
AND SOMETIMES
I WOULD GO IN
TO MAKE UP HIS BED,

1462
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
AND I WOULD FIND IT
UNDERNEATH HIS PILLOW...

1463
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
LIKE HAVING YOU NEARBY,
I GUESS.

1464
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
WHEN YOU FRAME
THOSE THINGS,

1465
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
CAN YOU TAKE OUT
THE THUMBTACK HOLES?

1466
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
YEAH, SURE.

1467
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
WHY?

1468
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
WELL,

1469
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I DREW THIS CRAYON PICTURE
OF A BOAT ON A LAKE,

1470
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
AND IT WON FIRST PRIZE
IN THE SECOND GRADE
SCHOOL FAIR.

1471
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
THEN MA WENT AHEAD
AND PINNED IT UP
IN MY ROOM.

1472
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I MEAN, SOMEDAY I WANT
TO PUT IT IN A FRAME,

1473
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
BUT I DON'T WANT
THE HOLES TO SHOW,

1474
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
LIKE IT WAS JUST
TORE OUT OF A MAGAZINE.

1475
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
AN ARTIST
IN THE FAMILY, HUH?

1476
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
IS MY DAD
AS TALL AS YOU?

1477
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
NOT QUITE, I GUESS.

1478
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
DO I LOOK LIKE HIM?

1479
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
MMM.

1480
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
YES.

1481
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
UNFORTUNATELY.

1482
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
HEH HEH HEH.

1483
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
I'LL NEVER FORGET
ALL THOSE CLASSES

1484
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
YOU TRAIPSED ME TO.

1485
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
SQUAT EXERCISES.

1486
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
BREATHING LESSONS.

1487
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
LISTEN,

1488
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
JUST BE GLAD
YOU HAD THEM.

1489
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
THE FIRST TIME
I WAS PREGNANT,

1490
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF THING.

1491
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I WAS SO SCARED.

1492
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
I REMEMBER
LEAVING THE HOSPITAL
WITH JESSE--

1493
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
AND I STOPPED AND I SAID,
"WAIT A MINUTE,

1494
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
"ARE THEY GOING TO LET ME
WALK OUT OF HERE WITH HIM?

1495
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I DON'T HAVE
A LICENSE TO DO THIS."

1496
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
IF YOU WANT TO
DRIVE A CAR,

1497
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
YOU NEED A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

1498
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,000
IT'S A LOT EASIER
TO DRIVE A CAR

1499
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
THAN IT IS TO LIVE
DAY AFTER DAY

1500
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
WITH A HUSBAND

1501
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
AND TRY TO RAISE
A BRAND-NEW BABY.

1502
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE

1503
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
HE STILL KEEPS
THAT DUMB OLD
SOAPBOX.

1504
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
IF YOU WANT TO
THROW A CURVE BALL,

1505
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
GET YOUR FINGERS
RIGHT ACROSS
THOSE SEAMS.

1506
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
WHEN YOU THROW IT,

1507
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
IT COMES OUT
LIKE THAT.

1508
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
YOU DON'T WANT
TO THROW A CURVE

1509
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
BECAUSE
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.

1510
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
THEY TAKE IT
AND SNAP IT
LIKE THAT.

1511
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
DOES HE STILL
LOOK THE SAME?

1512
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
YEAH. PRETTY MUCH.

1513
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
'COURSE, HE'S--

1514
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,000
HE'S...KIND OF MORE
GROWN-UP HANDSOME,

1515
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
YOU MIGHT SAY.

1516
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
SOMETIMES I THINK
I SHOULD'VE JUST

1517
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
FIRED OFF
ANOTHER TELEGRAM.

1518
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
ANOTHER TELEGRAM?

1519
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
OH, YEAH.

1520
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I DON'T SUPPOSE HE TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE TELEGRAM.

1521
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
NO.

1522
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
WELL,

1523
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
WHEN HE DIDN'T
NOTICE ME AT FIRST--

1524
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
HE WAS JUST THIS BOY
I WAS CRAZY ABOUT

1525
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
AND HE WAS GETTING
THIS BAND TOGETHER--

1526
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I SENT HIM A TELEGRAM.

1527
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
"FIONA STUCKEY WOULD
LIKE TO GO WITH YOU

1528
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
TO DEEP CREEK LAKE."

1529
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I KNEW HE WAS GOING THERE
WITH SOME FRIENDS.

1530
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
GOSH, CAN YOU BELIEVE
HOW CORNY?

1531
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
IS THAT HOW
THAT HAPPENED?

1532
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
WELL, IT
CERTAINLY MADE JESSE

1533
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE.

1534
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
I DON'T THINK
IT WAS CORNY AT ALL.

1535
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
IT GOT RESULTS.

1536
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
SHOOT, THERE HAVE
BEEN TIMES

1537
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
WHEN I THINK I'LL JUST
FIRE OFF ANOTHER TELEGRAM.

1538
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
"JESSE," I'D SAY,

1539
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
"I LOVE YOU STILL...

1540
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
AND IT BEGINS TO SEEM
I ALWAYS WILL."

1541
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
OH...

1542
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
FIONA...

1543
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I THINK THAT IS
SIMPLY LOVELY.

1544
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
MAYBE I SHOULD
RIDE BACK DOWN
WITH YOU.

1545
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
YES!

1546
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA!

1547
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
THEN, UH...
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T.

1548
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
OH, NO. GO WITH
YOUR FIRST IMPULSE.

1549
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I SHOULDN'T DRINK
IN THE DAYTIME.

1550
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
IT MAKES MY HEAD
SO MUZZY.

1551
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
NO, IT IS
A LOVELY IDEA.

1552
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
WELL...

1553
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
MOSTLY FOR LEROY,
OF COURSE.

1554
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
WE COULD...

1555
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
TAKE THE BUS BACK
TOMORROW.

1556
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
SHE'S GOT TO
BE IN SCHOOL MONDAY.

1557
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
JESSE WOULDN'T
HAVE TO KNOW.

1558
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
NOT REALLY.

1559
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I MEAN...

1560
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
YOU'RE LEROY'S
GRANDPARENTS.

1561
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
THAT'S THE POINT.

1562
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
OH!

1563
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I AM SO PLEASED.

1564
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
OH, WHAT
A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.

1565
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
WE HAD NO IDEA.

1566
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
WE WERE JUST

01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
ONE THING I DESPISE

1587
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
IS THESE NEW-STYLE
PLASTIC GROCERY BAGS

1588
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000

THAT CUT YOUR
FINGERS IN HALF.

INTO COMING HOME WITH US
FOR A LITTLE VISIT.

1598
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
FAT CHANCE OF THAT.

1599
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
WELL, SHE THINKS
SHE MIGHT DO IT.

1600
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
ME AND LEROY
MIGHT GO.

1601

YOU'D PULL SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

1632
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK
MY ONLY SON

1633

TO COME TO SUPPER
TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO HIS SISTER

THE FIRST ONE,

WHICH I DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT
UNTIL TODAY.

1643

"JESSE,
I LOVE YOU STILL,

I ALWAYS WILL."

GET OUR STUFF
OUT OF THE TRUNK.

1739
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
NO.
WE'LL CATCH THAT BUS.

1740
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
HEY, HOLD UP.

1741
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
TWO MORE FOR CARTWHEEL.

1742
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
YOU HAD TO DO IT,
DIDN'T YOU?

1743
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
ALL I DID
WAS MENTION REALITY.

1744
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
YOU AND REALITY
OUGHT TO GO STEADY.

1745
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
FIONA, I DIDN'T MEAN
YOU WEREN'T WELCOME.

1746
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
COME ON, IRA.
HURRY UP.

1747
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
LEROY, GET YOUR
BASEBALL MITT
OFF THE BACKSEAT.

1748
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
ALL I DID WAS
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

1749
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
OH, OF COURSE,
HONEY.

1750
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
LISTEN, FIONA,

1751
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I'VE GOT TO
CONFESS SOMETHING.

1752
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WOULD COME
FOR A VISIT,

1753
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I WENT UPSTAIRS
AND MADE A SNEAK
PHONE CALL TO JESSE

1754
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,000
ON YOUR
BEDROOM PHONE.

1755
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,000
YOU WHAT?

1756
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,000
I KNOW IT WAS WRONG.

1757
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I'M SORRY,
AND I'LL PAY FOR IT,

1758
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,000
BUT HE PROMISED
HE'D COME TO SUPPER.

1759
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
BUT THAT ROOM'S
SUCH A MESS.

1760
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I DON'T RECALL
IF I MADE MY BED.

1761
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
IT WAS NEAT
AS A PIN.

1762
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
WELL, WHAT DID
HIS MAJESTY SAY?

1763
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
HE SAID, UH...

1764
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
HE SAID HE WOULDN'T
MISS IT FOR ALL THE...

1765
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
RICE IN TIMBUKTU.

1766
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
WELL, THAT
SOUNDS LIKE HIM.

1767
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,000
HEY, LADY.

1768
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I'M DRIVING
THIS BUS NORTH.

1769
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
YOU WITH ME OR AGIN ME?

1770
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I DON'T THINK
I LIKE YOUR TONE.

1771
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
THEN YOU SURE AIN'T
GONNA LIKE MY DRIVING.

1772
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I DON'T LIKE
HIS TONE EITHER,
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW.

1773
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
[IRA]
WELL, THAT MAKES
FOUR OF US.

1774
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
AND IT'S NOT
A BASEBALL MITT.

1775
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
IT'S A GLOVE.

1776
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU WERE LISTENING.

1777
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,000
MY DAD ISN'T GOING
TO BE OFF DOING
A CONCERT, IS HE?

1778
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
LEROY,

1779
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING--

1780
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
IRA, LISTEN!

1781
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GO ON

1782
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
AND HOP
IN THE CAR

1783
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
AND DRIVE,
ALL RIGHT?

1784
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
WE'RE LATE,
ALL RIGHT?

1785
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
WE HAVE TO GO
TO THE MARKET.

1786
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
ME AND MA
LIKE DRUMSTICKS,

1787
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
AND SOMETIMES
ME AND MA EAT THIGHS,

1788
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
BUT WE DON'T THINK WINGS
ARE WORTH THE BOTHER.

1789
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
IT'S NOT "ME AND MA."

1790
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU.

1791
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
IT'S "MA AND ME."

1792
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
[MAGGIE]
LOOKS LIKE DAISY
ISN'T HOME YET.

1793
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
LEROY, THE TV SET
IS BROKEN,

1794
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
BUT WE HAVE A LOT
OF YOUR DAD'S OLD
RECORD COLLECTION.

1795
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
O.K.

1796
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
LOOKS LIKE HE
AIN'T COMING, HUH?

1797
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
IT'S EARLY.

1798
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
YOUR FATHER DOESN'T
KNOW THE MEANING
OF THE WORD "EARLY"

1799
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
IF I REMEMBER.

1800
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
IF HE PROMISED
HE'LL BE HERE,
HE'LL BE HERE.

1801
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
GRANDPA?

1802
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
OH, YOU CAN
COUNT ON IT.

1803
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,000
LIKE MONEY IN THE BANK.

1804
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I KNEW HE WASN'T COMING.

1805
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT
BEFORE WE LEFT.

1806
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,000
IT'S ONLY A FEW MINUTES
AFTER 7:30.

1807
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
YOU KNOW HOW JESSE IS
ABOUT CLOCKS.

1808
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
IT'S FUNNY HOW MUCH
YOU FORGET.

1809
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
WELL, HE ALWAYS OPENS
THAT FRONT DOOR

1810
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
WITH A BANG.

1811
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
THAT I REMEMBER.

1812
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
YOU SEE? AHA!

1813
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:26,000
LEROY ASKED ME
WHAT KIND OF MUSIC
HER FATHER PLAYS--

1814
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
NEW WAVE, PUNK,
OR HEAVY METAL.

1815
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
I THINK SHE WANTED
TO IMPRESS HER FRIENDS.

1816
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I TOLD HER I HAVEN'T
THE SLIGHTEST IDEA.

1817
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
BY NOW IT COULD BE
ANYTHING.

[MUSIC PLAYS]

1819
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
WELL, I THINK
SHE JUST FOUND OUT.

1820
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
IRA, DID YOU FORGET
WHAT IT WAS LIKE

1821
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
TO HAVE A KID
IN THE HOUSE?

1822
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
YEAH. I THOUGHT A PLANE
CRASHED INTO THE ROOF.

1823
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
STILL MUSIC
TO MY EARS.

1824
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I'LL TAKE YOUR BAGS
UPSTAIRS.

1825
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
OH, NO.

1826
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I'LL DO IT.

1827
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I SHOULD FRESHEN UP
A LITTLE ANYWAY.

1828
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
IS THE OLD ROOM
WHERE IT ALWAYS WAS?

1829
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,000
OH, YEAH.

1830
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000

HOME SWEET HOME.

I'M YOUR DAD.

POSING FOR A JEANS AD

SOME BETTER MUSIC
THAN THAT.

WAY TOO POPULAR

YOU CAN SEE THROUGH.

1875
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000

YOU KEPT IT.

IN THAT OLD
TREASURE DRAWER

REMINDED YOU OF ME.

SHE SAID YOU
CLOSED YOUR EYES

1880
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
AND HELD IT
TO YOUR NOSE.

1882
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
YOU SAID I SNIFFED

01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
WELL, I--NO--
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

TAKE ME FOR,

1885
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
DO YOU THINK I'D COME
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE

1886
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,000
LIKE AN ORDINARY GROUPIE

1887
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
IF YOUR MOTHER
HADN'T TOLD ME THAT?

1888
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
SHE SAID YOU WOULDN'T
LET CRYSTAL PACK IT.

1889
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I JUST--
MOM!

1890
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
HOLD IT!
HOLD IT!

1891
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,000
JUST WAIT A MINUTE.

1892
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
LET'S GET
SOMETHING STRAIGHT.

1893
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
JUST LEAVE MAGGIE
OUT OF THIS.

1894
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
MAGGIE ONLY WANTS THE BEST
FOR BOTH OF YOU.

1895
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
SO SHE MADE UP SOME STORY
ABOUT A SOAPBOX.

1896
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
SO WHAT.

1897
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I THOUGHT IT WAS CLEVER.

1898
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
TROUBLE IS,
IT'S JUST WASTED

01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
ON THE TWO OF YOU.

1900
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,000

BELIEVES THAT...

1901
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,000
THE PEOPLE SHE LOVES
ARE BETTER THAN THEY ARE,

1902
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
AND IF THAT'S A FAULT,
IT'S YOURS,

1903
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
NOT HERS.

1904
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
THE TRUTH IS,

1905
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
JESSE HAS
HIS OWN APARTMENT NOW.

1906
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000

HE'S SLEEPING WITH,

1907
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
BUT I'M SURE IT ISN'T
ANY SOAPBOX.

1908
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
YOU HAD TO
SPOIL THINGS.

1909
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
OH, MAGGIE,
IT'S THE SIMPLE TRUTH

1910
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
THAT SPOILED THINGS.

1911
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,000
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

1912
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
AM I WRONG, JESSE?

1913
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,000
IF I AM, TELL ME.

1914
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
YOU JUST DUCKED IN HERE
OUT OF CURIOSITY.

1915
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
AFTER SUPPER,
YOU'LL DUCK OUT
JUST AS FAST

1916
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
BEFORE YOUR MOTORCYCLE
EVEN COOLS OFF.

1917
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
YOU DON'T
KEEP GIRLFRIENDS

1918
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
ANY LONGER
THAN YOU KEEP JOBS.

1919
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
YOUR GIRL TURNS OUT
TO BE A BIMBO

1920
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
AND YOUR BOSSES,
BY SOME MAGICAL COINCIDENCE,

1921
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,000
TURN OUT TO BE JERKS.

1922
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I WON'T BE A PARTY

1923
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
TO YOUR BRINGING
YOUR EX-WIFE AND
DAUGHTER DOWN HERE

1924
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

1925
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME
I WISHED I WAS WRONG...

1926
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
IF I'M WRONG, JESSE,
TELL ME.

1927
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT.
WE'D ALL LOVE TO HEAR IT.

1928
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,000
OH, YOU, JE--

1929
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
JE--

1930
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
OH.

1931
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
JESSE'S JUST
UPSET, HONEY.

1932
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
OH, JUST STOP IT!

1933
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
BOTH OF YOU.

1934
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I'M TIRED TO DEATH
OF JESSE MORAN,

1935
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
AND I'M TIRED
OF THE TWO OF YOU.

1936
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
THE SAME
DUMB ARGUMENTS
AND BICKERING.

1937
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,000
IRA ALWAYS
SO RIGHTEOUS

1938
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
AND MAGGIE ALWAYS
TRYING TO PATCH,
PATCH, PATCH

1939
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
SOMETHING THAT'S
BEYOND FIXING.

1940
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG?

1941
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
WE'RE ALL JUST
TIRED AND HUNGRY.

1942
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
WE'LL ALL FEEL BETTER

1943
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
AFTER WE'VE HAD
SOMETHING TO EAT.

1944
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
JESSE WILL BE BACK.

1945
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I PROMISE.

1946
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,000
YOU'LL SEE.

1947
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
EVERYTHING'S READY
BACK THERE.

1948
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I'LL JUST GO
AND MAKE SURE
IT ISN'T BURNING.

1949
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
LEROY!

1950
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
HONEY, WHAT KIND
OF VEGETABLES DO YOU WANT,

1951
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
PEAS OR BEANS?

1952
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
LEROY?

1953
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
YOO-HOO!

1954
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
LEROY?

1955
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,000
FIONA?

1956
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
FIONA, LEROY,
ARE YOU UP THERE?

1957
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
WHAT KIND OF VEGETABLES
DO YOU WANT?

1958
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
ARE THEY THERE?

1959
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
THERE'S NOBODY
UP HERE.

1960
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
LOOK OUT
ON THE PORCH.

1961
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
OH.

1962
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,000
YOU TWO,

1963
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
YOU OUT HERE?

1964
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
THEY'VE GONE,
MAGGIE.

1965
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
THEY CAN'T BE.

1966
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
THEIR LUGGAGE
IS STILL HERE.

1967
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
NO, HONEY,
THEY'RE ON FOOT.

1968
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
IT WAS TOO HEAVY
TO CARRY.

1969
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
BUT--NO...
ON FOOT.

1970
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
FIONA'S SISTER LIVES
OVER NEAR BROADWAY.

1971
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
MAGGIE, NO.

1972
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
YES, I BET--

1973
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
FIONA!

1974
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
LEROY!

1975
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
FIONA!

1976
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,000
LEROY!

1977
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
LEROY!

1978
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
MAGGIE, HONEY.

1979
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,000
AH...

1980
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
AH...

1981
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
LET'S GO HOME.

1982
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
WHAT?

1983
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
LET'S GO HOME
IN CASE THEY COME BACK.

1984
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
THEY WON'T COME BACK.

1985
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
HONEY, YOU WANT
SOME FROZEN YOGURT?

1986
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
NO, THANKS.

1987
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
ALL YOU HAD FOR DINNER
WAS JUST A DRUMSTICK.

1988
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

1989
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
WHERE ARE ALL
YOUR TEDDY BEARS?

1990
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:14,000
IN THE BIG SUITCASE.

1991
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO TAKE THEM WITH YOU.

1992
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I CHANGED MY MIND.

1993
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
WELL, IF YOU NEED
ANY HELP, LET ME KNOW.

1994
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
THANKS, MOM.

1995
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
CARE FOR SOME
FROZEN YOGURT?

1996
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
MMM, NO, THANKS.

1997
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:56,000
GUESS I SHOULDN'T
EITHER.

1998
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
BUT...

1999
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
TRAVEL IS
SUCH A STRAIN.

2000
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,000
I FEEL AS THOUGH
I'VE BURNED OFF

2001
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
ABOUT
A MILLION CALORIES

2002
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
JUST SITTING
IN THAT CAR.

2003
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
LEROY REALLY
TOOK TO YOU,
DIDN'T SHE?

2004
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I PROMISED I'D FRAME
HER SECOND GRADE

2005
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,000
PRIZE-WINNING
CRAYON DRAWING

2006
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,000
AND TAKE THE THUMBTACK HOLES
OUT OF THE CORNERS.

2007
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
CAN YOU DO THAT?

2008
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I'M FAMOUS FOR IT.

2009
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I DON'T KNOW
THAT SHE'LL BE

2010
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
ALL THAT GLAD
TO SEE US AGAIN.

2011
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
OH, I THINK
SHE'LL BE EXPECTING US.

2012
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
SHE FORGOT
HER BASEBALL GLOVE.

2013
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
NOT REALLY.

2014
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
SHE LEFT IT ON
THE STEERING WHEEL
OF THE CAR

2015
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
SO WE COULDN'T MISS IT.

2016
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
OH.

2017
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
THAT LITTLE DEVIL.

2018
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
DON'T YOU JUST
LOVE HER?

2019
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
NOW BE HONEST.

2020
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I LOVE HER GRANDMA.

2021
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
DOES THAT COUNT?

2022
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
WASN'T CARTWHEEL DINKY?

2023
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,000
HMM.

2024
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I FORGOT HOW DINKY.

2025
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I'LL BET THEIR SCHOOL
IS DINKY, TOO.

2026
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
DO YOU SUPPOSE
THE CARTWHEEL SCHOOL

2027
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
OFFERS
A GOOD EDUCATION?

2028
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
I REALLY COULDN'T SAY.

2029
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
WELL, I CAN. I BET
IT'S AT LEAST A YEAR

2030
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
BEHIND THE
BALTIMORE SCHOOLS.
MAYBE TWO.

2031
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
THE BALTIMORE SCHOOLS
ARE REALLY SUPERB.

2032
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
WELL, THEY'RE
CERTAINLY BETTER
THAN CARTWHEEL'S.

2033
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
YOU KNOW
WHAT WE COULD DO?

2034
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,000
WE COULD WRITE TO FIONA

2035
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
AND ASK HER IF SHE'S
GIVEN ANY THOUGHT

2036
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
TO LEROY'S EDUCATION.

2037
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
THEN WE COULD SUGGEST

2038
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
THAT WE ENROLL HER INTO
THE BALTIMORE SCHOOLS

2039
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,000
AND SHE COULD COME
AND STAY WITH US.

2040
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
NO.

2041
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
NO.

2042
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
SOMETIMES I WONDER
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO

2043
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
WITH THE REST
OF OUR LIVES.

2044
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
WE'VE MANAGED
FOR 29 YEARS.

2045
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

2046
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
HMM.

2047
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,000
OH.

2048
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,000
OH.

2049
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
AH, WHAT--
OH, HERE.

2050
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,000
HA HA.

2051
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
RIGHT?

2052
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
MM-HMM.

2053
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
THIS IS PRETTY GOOD.

2054
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
MMM.

2055
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
