1
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:31,160
This place looks like a maze.

2
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:33,626
Look over there.

3
00:00:45,744 --> 00:00:47,143
We found them, down there

4
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,442
Let's get them,
I'm right behind you Anne

5
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,718
Hold on man!

6
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,062
Very deep.

7
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,118
Walk along there.

8
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,788
Four days ago,
a fire fell from the sky.

9
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,805
And it brought a man,
who would change my life forever.

10
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,803
But also came a pack
of dinosaur-like creatures,

11
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,378
in various ages, shapes, sizes,

12
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,740
and its' masters.

13
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,300
For all the questions I had
about the heavens,

14
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,204
All it brought was hell on earth.

15
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,578
Come, come, come!

16
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,121
Hurry, hurry!

17
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,573
Shit!

18
00:03:42,704 --> 00:03:43,820
Let's go!

19
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,500
From the future traveled a
master race of Cyborgs

20
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:02,400
They made abductions
from Earth's past.

21
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,850
The dinosaurs were
trained as trackers

22
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,400
The humans were
bred as slaves

23
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,800
Now a runaway slave escapes to
a place his people call heaven...

24
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,367
we know it as earth

25
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,318
Future War

26
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:40,753
Four days earlier

27
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:42,715
God he is alive,
Somebody help me!

28
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,732
Please, somebody help me!

29
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,250
In the car.

30
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,150
A man.

31
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,890
What's going on?

32
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,930
There's an injured man in the car.

33
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,668
He needs our help.

34
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,613
Hey, Oscar,
we need your help outside

35
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,950
Anne, sometimes it is good.

36
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,767
What do we've got?

37
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:32,601
Homeless guy with his throat
ripped out.

38
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,054
By what?

39
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,090
Figure mountain lion, grizzlies come
out of the hills in search of food.

40
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,050
Found this poor bastard
instead.

41
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,332
Just great, has anybody called
the Humane Society, the Zoo?

42
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,450
They're sending some people out.

43
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,960
Captain.

44
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,950
We've got something here.

45
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,650
We found this.

46
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,270
What the hell made that?

47
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,710
Jesus, I think I should be wearing a tie.

48
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,497
Don't give me a hard time, okay?

49
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,107
- I think you broke a bone.
- I mean, what is this bullshit?

50
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,033
I mean, no special favors.

51
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,031
Okay, anything you say,
Jesus Christ!

52
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,730
And watch that language, God damn it.

53
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,010
Okay, okay.

54
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,120
So now you don't like
my cooking, Sister?

55
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,914
No, I'm just not hungry.
Thanks for cooking.

56
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,850
Hey, I have some nice chocolate cakes,
some mocha almond ice cream.

57
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,042
- Hey, I'll have some.
- No, thanks, I think I'll pass.

58
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,430
This is worse than I thought.

59
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,440
You're at home now.

60
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,270
So what's going on?

61
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,690
Maybe I'm not meant for this.

62
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,810
Maybe I'm meant for something else.

63
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,420
Maybe.

64
00:21:17,984 --> 00:21:23,093
Sister Superior says
that I'm having a crisis of faith.

65
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,230
Maybe?

66
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,270
Well, what do you think?

67
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,926
Maybe.

68
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,792
Come on, I'm looking
for some counseling here Fred.

69
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,478
Hey, I cut meat you know?
Personally,

70
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,410
I think you're getting a little stupid
about that kid that bought the farm.

71
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,490
Remember Jimmy Ho?

72
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,170
Remember Lena Melter?

73
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,010
I heard about Terry.
Sorry.

74
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,410
- How is our guest?
- Unconscious.

75
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,670
Look what I found.

76
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,170
Maybe he's into some
kind of bondage thing.

77
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,610
Smart guy.

78
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,410
I patched up what I could without X rays.

79
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,490
I'll know more tomorrow.

80
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,251
Why don't you have a seat, nurse?

81
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,930
No, no time I got to get back
to the clinic.

82
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,990
Terrible habits, girl.

83
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,810
It's good to have you back, Anne.
Thanks.

84
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,810
I'll stop by after my shift is okay.

85
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,890
Bye.

86
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,170
You want something, Max?

87
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,210
Uncle Fred says you don't have a husband.

88
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,650
Uncle Fred says you're going
to shave your head and turn to a penguin.

89
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,570
- A penguin?
- Can I watch?

90
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,440
It was a metaphor.

91
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,700
He says you don't know
what you're doing, he says...

92
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,730
...time to go to bed now.

93
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,530
Go brush your teeth.
Go on.

94
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,690
- Say good night.
- Good night.

95
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,465
You're right you know...

96
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,490
Come on Annie, I was just talking.

97
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,409
Two days ago, I was so sure.

98
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:45,711
And what today
you don't know nothing?

99
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,440
Look, when we met,
you were hiding from a pimp.

100
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,410
You just did a month in the joint.

101
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,570
You were suicidal and addicted.

102
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,370
Keeping you in here was hard.

103
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,706
Garina was killed by some guy,

104
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,766
wired up on the drugs
he bought from me.

105
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,423
Come on now Annie

106
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:11,890
- Sure looks like I pulled the trigger.
- But you didn't, he did.

107
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,810
You came here and got clean.

108
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,410
You helped other girls off
the junk and off the street.

109
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,270
That means something, Annie.

110
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,450
I'm going to go up north
and visit an aunt.

111
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,503
You take care of that guy.

112
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:42,610
Listen kid. Everything's going
to work out just fine.

113
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,630
You'll see.

114
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,910
Hope so.

115
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,210
- Guess he is awake.
- Yeah.

116
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,130
- How's he doing?
- Okay.

117
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,450
I try to talk to him.

118
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,410
English, spanish.

119
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,930
He doesn't talk, but I
think he understands.

120
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,850
I left him in the daycare room.

121
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,430
Let's go have a look.

122
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,330
Maybe he can tell us
what this thing is for.

123
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,450
Where are you going?

124
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,370
I'm going to go to my room and pack.

125
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,444
I want to be on the road by twelve.

126
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,412
Aren't you going to stay
help us with this guy, he is yours.

127
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:23,368
Yes, sister come on.
You're good at this kind of thing.

128
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,130
Hi there.
I'm Fred.

129
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,430
That's Romero and that Sister Anne.

130
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,310
Hey, man, what's your story?

131
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,230
You understand English?

132
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,000
Leave me alone with him.

133
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,730
Bullshit, this guy might
be a psycho.

134
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,090
And what do you think?

135
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,978
He's going to open up ot you in there?

136
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,190
Why not? I'm a likable guy.

137
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,210
Fred, his collar.

138
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,270
You just say the word,
I'll be right outside the door.

139
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:12,450
German dots, huh?
Hey, you like that?

140
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,910
The pictures in the magazines.

141
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,450
USA.
Sounds like a great place.

142
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,510
It's Fishers.

143
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:36,070
You can hear us and I
think you understand us.

144
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,150
You want to give us a break?

145
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:48,670
If not, well, enjoy.

146
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:03,928
Well, thank you for
not killing me.

147
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:23,370
There's something wrong with your throat.
Yeah.

148
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:26,570
You can understand us,
but you can't talk, right?

149
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,290
Is that it?
Is that it?

150
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,651
When I nod my head like this,
I mean yes. Is that it, Yes?

151
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,410
And when I shake my head no,
I mean no, right?

152
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,190
Yes.

153
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,870
Where are you from?

154
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,690
Hey, maybe you can write.

155
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,470
Okay.

156
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,990
Not a clue.

157
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:14,870
Hey, the map.
Let's see here.

158
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,550
No.
Okay.

159
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,190
Here.

160
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:34,990
I'm sorry, I...
Oh up here.

161
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:53,325
Hi, my name is Max

162
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,985
Hi, my name is Max

163
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,912
Where are you going?

164
00:29:04,095 --> 00:29:06,277
I'm gonna go visit an aunt
I have up north.

165
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,344
I just came to say goodbye.

166
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,596
So, goodbye.

167
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,972
Hey, don't worry,
they're gonna take good care of...

168
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,674
Well, maybe now you can tell me
where you come from.

169
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:24,791
You. Here. I. Come.

170
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:29,648
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I'm sorry.

171
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:39,145
Okay.

172
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:45,901
Yeah. Max, did you show him
any space videos?

173
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah

174
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:27,649
- No! They're my friends!
- Run! Must run!

175
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,078
God. Thank you.
I think we've outrun them.

176
00:30:53,582 --> 00:30:56,865
You are a penguin?

177
00:30:58,945 --> 00:31:03,025
No. I'm a sister, not a penguin.

178
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:11,295
You know, how is it you know English today?

179
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,611
when you didn't know English yesterday?

180
00:31:14,325 --> 00:31:16,684
It was hard for me to understand him.

181
00:31:17,153 --> 00:31:20,471
For all the problems I had,
maybe I just didn't want to be a part of his.

182
00:31:21,234 --> 00:31:23,716
He explained to me how quickly
he could learn,

183
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:27,054
how his vocal chords needed
to adjust to speak our tongue,

184
00:31:27,323 --> 00:31:29,416
and how he had heard our words before.

185
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:32,122
His eyes were so honest but,

186
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:34,800
still there was a part of him
that I didn't trust.

187
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,871
- And who are you?
- A tool.

188
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:43,042
And you come from?
Never mind.

189
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:16,775
You're human.

190
00:32:18,042 --> 00:32:20,039
I am a tool.

191
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:23,999
And you're from up there?

192
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:25,650
The Palgaon,

193
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:32,700
the first were harvested
from this world like trackers long ago.

194
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,626
We are used to build because
we have these.

195
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:47,138
The Masters do not have these.

196
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:51,797
They can make their own thumbs,
but they just don't want to?

197
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:54,993
They want us to do the work.

198
00:32:55,192 --> 00:32:58,188
Yeah, I knew a few pimps in my time.

199
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,185
Pimps?

200
00:33:00,984 --> 00:33:02,567
You wouldn't understand.

201
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:07,336
Like the Bible says,
my thoughts are not your thoughts.

202
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:12,668
Neither are your ways,
my ways, says the Lord.

203
00:33:14,967 --> 00:33:16,930
This is a con.

204
00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:20,959
No, no. No trick. No lie.

205
00:33:21,158 --> 00:33:25,153
How does an alien bred human
know quotes from the Bible?

206
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:28,624
In the world where I am from,

207
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:35,190
in the place where the tools are kept
are unscheduled words.

208
00:33:35,842 --> 00:33:41,722
A phrase told in darkness.
I have heard your language before.

209
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:46,925
Well, explain this so I can understand it.

210
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:51,242
This place was the most important story.

211
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,778
Our dream.

212
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:55,826
Our heaven.

213
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,358
And now I'm free.

214
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:04,167
He was so honest.
I explained to him about the heavens.

215
00:34:04,902 --> 00:34:09,914
I was studying to become a nun.
but now I'm having second thoughts.

216
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:16,925
When I was younger I ran away
and I have a past that I'm not proud of.

217
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:22,878
I found the church and they helped me.

218
00:34:23,877 --> 00:34:28,836
But just recently a friend of mine
died of a drug overdose.

219
00:34:28,871 --> 00:34:30,997
I blame myself for her death.

220
00:34:31,796 --> 00:34:36,049
I don't know.
I feel somehow responsible.

221
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:55,100
Sister Anne, are you alright?

222
00:34:57,335 --> 00:35:01,618
Ever since yesterday at the burial,
I've been asking myself...

223
00:35:02,337 --> 00:35:04,200
what I missed.

224
00:35:04,423 --> 00:35:08,154
You didn't miss anything my dear.
It wasn't your fault.

225
00:35:08,318 --> 00:35:09,317
How come I wasn't taken?

226
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,313
Because you weren't. And that's that.

227
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:19,804
I don't know if I'm going
to take my final vows next week.

228
00:35:20,803 --> 00:35:23,799
Because of Terry Joe?
That's what this is?

229
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:26,795
You knew what I was before I came here.

230
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:30,790
Well you had a record.
So did Mary Magdalene.

231
00:35:31,288 --> 00:35:34,990
I was a whore doing tricks
in back alleys, I sold drugs.

232
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:37,328
Sister Anne, that was then.

233
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,777
I'm very proud of you now.

234
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:43,773
I'm not.

235
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:48,766
Well then, we have a problem here don't we?

236
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:56,457
She was smart sister
good, tough.

237
00:35:57,756 --> 00:35:58,718
Sister.

238
00:35:58,753 --> 00:36:01,311
- I should have been there for her.
- Sister Anne

239
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,390
why don't you take the weekend?

240
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:05,744
Visit your friends and family?

241
00:36:06,743 --> 00:36:09,739
Perfection is not one
of the requirements. Faith is.

242
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:12,735
Sister, do you believe in signs?

243
00:36:14,732 --> 00:36:16,730
I guess I do.

244
00:36:20,724 --> 00:36:25,718
Keep your eyes open.
God always answers prayers.

245
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:36,668
What about the tracker?
What happens now?

246
00:36:37,742 --> 00:36:41,176
The tracker will rest, then go back,

247
00:36:43,748 --> 00:36:46,124
to where it first found us.

248
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,688
I don't believe this.

249
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,676
Are you going back? Yes.

250
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,671
But the tracker has her scent now. Tough.

251
00:37:01,706 --> 00:37:05,666
If I go with you, it will find me.

252
00:37:06,664 --> 00:37:09,660
Well then you better get back on the train.

253
00:37:12,656 --> 00:37:13,655
I do not understand.

254
00:37:14,654 --> 00:37:16,651
This is something I have to do.

255
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,647
I'd like to give you some
big words of wisdom.

256
00:37:20,646 --> 00:37:22,643
But I just don't have any. My mind is blank.

257
00:37:22,678 --> 00:37:27,062
You do what you have to do.
Goodbye.

258
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,628
What are you doing?

259
00:37:35,626 --> 00:37:37,624
Doing what I believe to.

260
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:40,620
And what's that?

261
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,388
I'm going with you.

262
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,576
Look, let's get this straight.
I work alone.

263
00:37:48,714 --> 00:37:53,636
Alone by myself. I want to be alone.

264
00:37:54,096 --> 00:37:59,595
Better is a neighbor that is near
than a brother far off.

265
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:03,974
I don't want to talk about this.

266
00:38:14,885 --> 00:38:18,247
The number you have reached
is not in service.

267
00:38:21,546 --> 00:38:25,810
- Heaven is a mess, isn't it?
- I don't know, I like it.

268
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,484
How many people got murdered today?

269
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,237
Or raped, Beaten, Oh missing?

270
00:38:36,122 --> 00:38:39,182
- You're upset.
- Yeah, I'm upset.

271
00:38:39,543 --> 00:38:43,656
- But you want to help your friends.
- That's different. I know them.

272
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:46,838
You don't know me.
You help me.

273
00:38:47,532 --> 00:38:50,852
Greater love has no man than this.

274
00:38:51,548 --> 00:38:55,522
Than a man lay down his life for his friend.

275
00:38:56,521 --> 00:38:58,518
I gotta get out of here.

276
00:39:01,514 --> 00:39:04,342
That is what I want to be.

277
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,468
- What?
- A man.

278
00:39:07,506 --> 00:39:08,505
You are a man.

279
00:39:08,782 --> 00:39:14,120
No. I mean greater love. That kind of man.

280
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:19,491
You better be careful what you wish for.

281
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:56,825
We're going on the assumption
that some animal,

282
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:59,380
out of the hills has gone on a rampage.

283
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:03,844
The body found here at Third Street
makes four deaths in six hours.

284
00:40:04,442 --> 00:40:09,436
This creature knows where it's going.
I want cars posted all along this route.

285
00:40:10,835 --> 00:40:14,829
Stay in close radio contact at all times.
Let's go.

286
00:40:17,364 --> 00:40:23,016
- Is God out there?
- God of Gods. King of Kings.

287
00:40:23,815 --> 00:40:27,810
You don't even know what you're saying,
do you? You don't.

288
00:40:28,808 --> 00:40:31,804
What's out there? Is Heaven out there?

289
00:40:32,803 --> 00:40:33,767
Earth is Heaven.

290
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:40,060
And the supreme being is what?

291
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:43,796
Handlers, masters.

292
00:40:44,131 --> 00:40:46,602
Not them. Greater than them.

293
00:40:57,698 --> 00:40:59,876
Help!

294
00:41:02,255 --> 00:41:04,252
Western Division, Officer Fry speaking.
How may I help you?

295
00:41:05,851 --> 00:41:11,808
Help. Officer. Anybody.
Help us, please.

296
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:28,565
10-4, Unit 41-K. 905-V in progress.
Fifth Street Warehouse. Code 3. Over.

297
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,942
This is WCNG reporter C.N. McGill,

298
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,015
reporting to you live
from the Fifth Street Warehouse

299
00:41:44,366 --> 00:41:48,093
where there has been
a reported animal attack.

300
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Shit!

301
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
More updates as they occur.

302
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,244
Captain, there are employees
still in the plant in the back of a storeroom.

303
00:42:10,235 --> 00:42:15,608
Joey, lead in the tactical team.
You take the point.

304
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,785
Hey, Joey. Captain wants to know
if you've spotted that bear yet.

305
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,765
No, sir.

306
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,350
Try a picnic basket, boo-boo.

307
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,100
I just found blood staines surface
right here...

308
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,800
You sure it's not ketchup?

309
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,300
No, sir. It's real.

310
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:24,998
Focus on Polaris.

311
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,800
What happened?

312
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,800
You two, follow me.

313
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,071
Joey! Joey, where are you, man?

314
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,146
Maybe I should let him go in by himself.

315
00:44:09,335 --> 00:44:10,977
- Otis, we got something here.
- What is it?

316
00:44:11,746 --> 00:44:14,800
It's Joey. What's left of it?

317
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,800
All patrols, northeast corner.

318
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
Jesus.

319
00:44:37,364 --> 00:44:38,800
Leo.

320
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,500
Sometimes tools will run.

321
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,562
When the trackers catch them,
it's like this.

322
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,703
Hey, it's coming back.

323
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,458
Don't shoot, boys. Behind him.
We might hit each other.

324
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,500
- Can you kill it with that?
- Yeah, here. Cut here.

325
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,404
It's the softest place.

326
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:21,547
Just a moment.

327
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,765
Don't miss.

328
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,702
Where are you going?

329
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,468
Get down!

330
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,300
Captain Polaris.

331
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,300
Captain Polaris? Are you there?
Captain Polaris?

332
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,800
We got the bastard, Sergeant.

333
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,765
We've got a situation here.

334
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,800
What do you mean, you've got a situation?

335
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,800
I mean we've got more
monster sightings in the city.

336
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,800
More? How could there be more?

337
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:33,254
They come in packs. They're after me.

338
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,442
They will continue to hurt people,

339
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:39,905
until they find me.
Bring me to them.

340
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,000
Otis Smitty, place this man under arrest.

341
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:45,557
He just saved you and everybody
in the building from that thing.

342
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,965
He's not a criminal.

343
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:49,155
He won't run away this time.

344
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,894
Now if you'll excuse us, Sister Anne,
your friend's got some questions to answer.

345
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
How did you know who I was?

346
00:46:55,515 --> 00:46:57,900
Fred Burroughs told us
how he got you to give him a ride,

347
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,524
- but don't worry, you're free to go.
- What?

348
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,535
An information blackout out
has fallen on the city.

349
00:47:26,784 --> 00:47:29,100
Highly placed sources
have noted a freak accident

350
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,400
has cost enough for oil animals
to escape from the zoo.

351
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,498
They are extremely dangerous.

352
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:51,778
They don't care about us, Annie.
They just cut us loose.

353
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,800
Is Terry Joe's brother still running
with the 12th Street gang?

354
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,800
Yeah.

355
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,800
Can you set up a meeting with me?

356
00:48:02,835 --> 00:48:03,765
What for?

357
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,195
So he can shoot me.

358
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,460
You got something to say to me?

359
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:15,540
Sorry about Terry, Joe.

360
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,300
I'm sorry.

361
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,513
She had deep thoughts, you know?

362
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,260
I need your help.

363
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,700
For what?

364
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,820
Monsters in the hood?

365
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,808
So, Dr. Tanaga,

366
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,800
what's your honest opinion?

367
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:01,480
What's there not to believe?

368
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:05,040
A race of transplanted humans
bred on another planet.

369
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,760
One of them escapes,
returns to his ancestral world.

370
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:13,510
And these dinosaurs and their
masters are here to bring him back.

371
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,894
Personally, I think he's nuts.

372
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:19,950
I've seen these dinosaurs, doctor.

373
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,120
They're real.

374
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:24,522
Maybe his story is real too.

375
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,040
- Captain.
- Federal agents.

376
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:29,492
We're taking over this
case as of right now.

377
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,037
- Under whose authority?
- National security Captain,

378
00:51:34,152 --> 00:51:36,400
You hereby relieved of this
case and ordered to leave the room now.

379
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,790
I'm taking this to the commissioner.

380
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,080
I don't believe this.

381
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:47,060
Can you explain this?

382
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,280
I said, can you explain this?

383
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,120
They're trackers.

384
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,480
When the tracker was killed,
what happened to his body?

385
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:57,820
Self destruct.

386
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,180
So they leave no trace.

387
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,820
Like this.

388
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,720
You look so human.

389
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,900
I'm a man.

390
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,780
So you say.

391
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,247
Bring the doctor back in,
we can do the testing in here.

392
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,470
Well...

393
00:52:34,073 --> 00:52:36,945
it appears to be
a transmitter of some kind.

394
00:52:37,624 --> 00:52:39,520
I'm taking it to the lab.

395
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:43,140
Can you all leave the room, please?

396
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,760
I apologize for this humiliation.

397
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,600
It's my job.

398
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:51,120
I have a job too.

399
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,140
I'm a tool.

400
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,200
My life is my job.

401
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,460
Mine too.

402
00:53:01,993 --> 00:53:03,900
Barbara here, take a look at this.

403
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,672
and send the results
to my office, please.

404
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,183
Barbara I heard a noise that...

405
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:35,996
Willis, Dexter
we're taking him to Lane today

406
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,000
What is it?
You know?

407
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,820
Don't you

408
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,724
Freeze damn it!

409
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,040
Can't count on the police.

410
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:37,280
Can't count on anybody.

411
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,520
What do you want us to do?

412
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,720
We can stop these things together.

413
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,840
Yeah, right.
Together.

414
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,832
Together means
we do all the work, right? 

415
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,400
No! we're out of here.

416
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,906
Get your ass down.
Sister's right.

417
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,640
Nobody's going to help us with that.

418
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:53,000
They got the neighborhood
by the balls, man.

419
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,000
Don't scare us.

420
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,560
Don't be out of the street either.

421
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,360
That's enough.

422
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:59,640
Let them go.

423
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:02,245
They don't have to help
us if they don't want to.

424
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,720
You saying we're afraid?

425
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,960
No, but there's going to be a fight.

426
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:09,360
And it's going to be bad.

427
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,760
And it's going to be bloody.

428
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:12,755
So where do we find these things?

429
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,137
They're always near water.

430
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,500
That could be a lot of places.

431
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:21,811
Then we do it the hard way,
and we look.

432
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,280
Come here.

433
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,020
Fresh tracks.

434
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:08,420
Very deep.

435
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:14,091
Run!

436
00:58:16,616 --> 00:58:18,022
Let's get on the truck!

437
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,060
Roger.

438
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,760
God, we're going to be massacred.

439
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,616
We're going to have to take
a stand tonight.

440
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,000
You will attack the trackers?

441
00:58:57,030 --> 00:59:00,794
- You got something better?
- Listen, they're after me.

442
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,759
- I will give myself to them.
- That's no plan.

443
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:06,080
But they are after him.

444
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,268
Can these things die?

445
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,198
Yeah.

446
00:59:11,656 --> 00:59:13,560
Come on, man
you're talking heavy artillery,

447
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,602
We can't get anything like that.

448
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:19,500
Yes, we can.

449
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:41,240
Conroy, I need some weapons.

450
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:44,140
Some real heavy stuff.

451
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,840
Hey, Annie.

452
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,820
Hello, Chadwick.

453
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,520
We go back, don't we?

454
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:55,640
We go way back.

455
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:58,100
I'm not here to talk about that.
Hold it.

456
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,160
Okay, I'm sorry.

457
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:00,480
I didn't mean nothing.

458
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:02,000
I've come to contribute.

459
01:00:02,030 --> 01:00:03,660
Here.

460
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,220
What's this?

461
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,088
- Found a high-grade white.
- Killing dose?

462
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,570
Should have killed a whole city block.

463
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,258
And there's this.

464
01:00:15,054 --> 01:00:17,533
Everyone needs some finance, babe.

465
01:00:18,154 --> 01:00:21,108
- Who is that?
- None of your business.

466
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,674
Guess you gotta take the bad
with the good, huh?

467
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,162
Good night, sister.

468
01:00:35,755 --> 01:00:36,685
Conroy!

469
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,120
I got the money.

470
01:00:38,155 --> 01:00:39,120
Now can you help?

471
01:00:39,155 --> 01:00:40,120
Sure, Annie.

472
01:00:40,455 --> 01:00:42,394
Fine, get in.

473
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,731
Wait, this is it.

474
01:02:09,048 --> 01:02:10,742
Let's go.

475
01:03:50,936 --> 01:03:56,595
Go, go in here, go
come on, go.

476
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:00,488
Go, go.

477
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,378
Look over there?

478
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,192
It seems to be all clear.

479
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,845
We found him, down there.

480
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,806
We have to draw them out of there.

481
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,356
I know.

482
01:07:47,906 --> 01:07:49,992
Are you scared?

483
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,308
Yeah.

484
01:07:54,366 --> 01:07:57,632
Greater love hath no man, remember?

485
01:07:59,000 --> 01:07:59,906
I do.

486
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:16,432
Let's do this thing.

487
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,308
Come on, Over here.

488
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,860
Come on,
come on let's go!

489
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:48,800
Take them! Take them!

490
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,410
Four days ago, a fire fell from the sky,

491
01:14:07,036 --> 01:14:10,594
and I thought everything it brought
would just extinguish and burn away.

492
01:14:11,255 --> 01:14:13,697
Now for all the questions
and doubts I had,

493
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,550
everything seemed so clear.

494
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,794
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

495
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:28,426
Dear sister,

496
01:14:28,876 --> 01:14:33,755
do you now want to commit
to this bond of perpetual devotion?

497
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,430
Yes, I will.

498
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,512
Do you want to strive
for the perfect love of God

499
01:14:38,768 --> 01:14:42,002
and of your neighbor following
the Spirit of the Gospel?

500
01:14:45,255 --> 01:14:47,185
Yes, I will.

501
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,914
By the grace of the Holy Spirit,

502
01:14:49,182 --> 01:14:51,412
do you want to generously
spend your whole life

503
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,136
in the service of God's people?

504
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,726
By the grace of the Holy Spirit,

505
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,500
do you want to spend
your whole life

506
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,652
in the service of God's people?

507
01:15:17,078 --> 01:15:18,869
Yes, I will.

508
01:17:36,047 --> 01:17:37,919
The ambulance is here.

509
01:17:38,941 --> 01:17:41,871
So much to learn. So much.

510
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:44,066
You're going to be alright, okay?

511
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:48,740
I learned from you. I once.

512
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,696
Greater love has no man than this.

513
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,218
I want to be that man.

514
01:17:59,255 --> 01:18:01,973
You are. You are.

515
01:18:02,189 --> 01:18:06,604
You ask me
if there's a heaven out there.

516
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,294
I know.

517
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,396
Four days ago a fire fell from the sky.

518
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,768
Everything he wanted
was everything I needed.

519
01:18:21,955 --> 01:18:26,544
- Hellstreet Rehab, how can I help you?
- Hello, I'm a runaway, I'm all alone.

520
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,488
Can you help me, please?

521
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,620
I'd like to share a quote
from the Bible with you.

522
01:18:31,065 --> 01:18:33,700
Now that passion for living and giving life,

523
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:37,091
runs deeply and forever in my heart
