1
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,782
Dr. cruler:
<i> Intruder alert!</i>
<i> Intruder alert!</i>

2
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:19,284
<i> Attention all hydra</i>
<i> defense units!</i>

3
00:00:19,286 --> 00:00:20,919
<i> Proceed to the</i>
<i> South platform.</i>

4
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,254
<i> Lethal force</i>
<i> is authorized.</i>

5
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:26,025
<i> I repeat.</i>
<i> Lethal force is authorized.</i>

6
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,693
(Grunts)

7
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,261
(Laser firing)

8
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,964
Red skull:
<i> Captain America.</i>

9
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:37,269
<i> Super soldier.</i>

10
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,771
(Grunts)

11
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:46,378
<i> One of the greatest leaders,</i>
<i> combatants and tacticians</i>

12
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,447
<i> who ever lived.</i>

13
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:53,719
The only thing I hate
more than hydra soldiers
are hydra robots.

14
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:56,355
(Groans)

15
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,957
(Grunts)

16
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,327
<i> He was once a normal man.</i>

17
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,904
Did we get him?
Where is he?

18
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,039
(Groans)

19
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:14,540
Fire!

20
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:18,343
<i> A weakling,</i>
<i> who took the experimental</i>
<i> super soldier serum.</i>

21
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:21,647
<i> That man</i>
<i> became unstoppable.</i>

22
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:25,417
<i> Coupled with his</i>
<i> unbreakable shield.</i>

23
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,319
(All groan)

24
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,824
<i> Trained in dozens</i>
<i> of fighting styles.</i>

25
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:34,893
<i> He is the pinnacle</i>
<i> of human potential.</i>

26
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:39,731
<i> One of the toughest</i>
<i> warriors of the modern age.</i>

27
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,334
<i> An allied hero</i>
<i> in world war ii,</i>

28
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:46,605
<i> he'd battled the forces</i>
<i> of hydra with some success,</i>

29
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,173
<i> until he fought</i>
<i> his superior.</i>

30
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:52,578
<i> With the fate of the globe</i>
<i> hanging in the balance,</i>

31
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,347
<i> their battle ended</i>
<i> in a draw.</i>

32
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,950
Captain America: Hey!
(Grunts)

33
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:03,589
<i> When their plane</i>
<i> went down in the ice,</i>
<i> they were frozen.</i>

34
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:06,625
<i> Revived only recently.</i>

35
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,327
Well?

36
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,596
His skills
are extraordinary.

37
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,266
Difficult to copy,
but not impossible.

38
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,569
So says the taskmaster.

39
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,904
Don't worry,
red skull.

40
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:23,609
My photographic
reflexes can mimic
anyone, even him.

41
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,878
Mimicking him and
defeating him

42
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,447
are two very different things.

43
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,883
I believe a test
is in order.

44
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:32,618
(Weapons firing)

45
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,701
That was a test?

46
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,337
Well done, taskmaster.

47
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,207
But captain America
is more than skill.

48
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,678
It is his focus, will,
and mind that make
him who he is.

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,782
Sounds like somebody's
got a little man-crush
there, red...

50
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:04,283
(Chocking)

51
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:09,555
The captain and I are
two sides of the same coin.

52
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:12,624
Do not underestimate him,

53
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,693
or me.

54
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:18,597
You've seen my skill.

55
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,264
You know what I can do.

56
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:24,703
Emulating captain America
isn't enough
for my final goal.

57
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,573
I need the
super soldier himself.

58
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:29,575
Taskmaster:
Leave it to me.

59
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:30,642
Red skull:
That's not all.

60
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:35,180
Another avenger
possesses something
I require.

61
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,382
Iron man.

62
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,685
Stark?
Tony stark?

63
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,854
What do you want
with that rich fame ball?

64
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:45,290
I don't want the man.

65
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,658
I want his weapons.

66
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,429
I've been preparing
for iron man as well.

67
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:51,964
I know all
his weaknesses.

68
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:56,301
I am not convinced
you can take on
two avengers alone.

69
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:59,404
So I've prepared
reinforcements.

70
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,175
All: (Chanting)
Hail hydra!
Hail the red skull!

71
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:05,410
Hail hydra!
Hail the red skull!

72
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:11,416
Soon you will see
what sets me apart
from captain America,

73
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,386
when I rule this world!

74
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:20,952
Iron man:
You sure about this, cap?

75
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,689
I mean, I've got
the world's most
highly advanced

76
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,224
repulsor-powered armor
and you've got...

77
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,528
No offense, a glorified
trash can lid.

78
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,363
Look, I don't wanna
hurt you.

79
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,231
Did you say trash can lid?

80
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,766
(Grunts)

81
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,069
Ah!

82
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,204
Wait a second,
I didn't say go!

83
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,840
In combat, you can't
always be the one
who says go!

84
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,110
That's your problem,
stark, you never strategize.

85
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,345
You just wing it.
(Firing)

86
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,847
It's called thinking
on your feet.

87
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,349
Or in my case,
boot jets.

88
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:55,520
I adapt to the
unexpected by being
unpredictable.

89
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,923
You, on the other hand,

90
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,094
are super predictable.

91
00:06:02,096 --> 00:06:06,765
You used that same move
on the wrecking crew
last week.

92
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,767
(Grunts)

93
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:12,871
Whoa!

94
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,273
Ouch!

95
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,309
Worked both times,
didn't it?

96
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:21,113
Yeah, but do you
got anything new?
(Laser firing)

97
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,283
I'm pretty sure you
haven't seen this one.

98
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,386
Pretty sure I have.

99
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:28,653
(Grunts)

100
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,655
Well, then stop it!

101
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,025
Okay, you got me.

102
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:38,196
But if I had really
cut loose, you'd be
toast by now.

103
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:39,097
Well, then don't
hold back.

104
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,068
Your suit's a great weapon,
stark, but trust me,
it can be a crutch.

105
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,271
A crutch? This time,
I won't hold back.

106
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,407
And to make it
interesting, how about
a little bet?

107
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:52,878
When I win, you have
to wear my armor
for a month.

108
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,980
And don't worry,
I got one in your colors.

109
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:57,582
Well, I don't need
a stuffy sardine can,
but okay.

110
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:02,187
However, when I win,
you go to boot camp
training with me.

111
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,755
And I hope you like
push-ups, Tony.

112
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,856
I see a lot of 'em
in your future.

113
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:10,896
I usually hire someone
to do push-ups for me, but
you know what, you're on!

114
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:11,463
All right, Jarvis.

115
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,498
Let's turn old red, white
and blue

116
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,834
into plain old black and blue.

117
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,702
Jarvis: <i> If you say so.</i>

118
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,939
Captain America:
You wanna say go
this time, stark?

119
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,142
Iron man: Very funny.
On your mark,
get-set-go!

120
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,344
(Laser firing)
(Grunts)

121
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,383
Nice one. Block this!

122
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,785
You're making it easy!

123
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,786
(Shield clanks)

124
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,954
So are you!

125
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,489
Oh, really?

126
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:42,627
Give up?

127
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,164
Jarvis: <i> Captain America</i>
<i> has damaged several</i>
<i> quantum dot nanocircuits.</i>

128
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,567
<i> Power is down by 15%.</i>

129
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,768
No sweat.

130
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,369
Watch this.

131
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,004
(Shield clanking)

132
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,841
See? This is what
I'm talking about.

133
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,509
All armor,
no skill.

134
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:02,881
Don't need your skill
when my weapons
can do this!

135
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,449
(Explosion)

136
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,990
Captain America:
You need to use your
most important weapon,

137
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,325
your brain, more often.

138
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,493
Hey bucko, you're
talking to the guy

139
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:20,665
who can divide quintic
polynomials in his head
while trimming his nose hairs!

140
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,000
(Grunts)

141
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:22,834
Ah!

142
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,838
So keep your left up
and guard those
pretty nose hairs.

143
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,539
You've made your point.

144
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,976
So, now I'm gonna
make mine and win this!

145
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,544
(Grunts)

146
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,960
(Clanks)

147
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,331
Captain America: Fine.
We'll call it a draw.

148
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,766
Iron man: For now.

149
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,903
Just another little
tweak and...

150
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,206
Jarvis: <i> Repulsors are</i>
<i> at 100%, sir.</i>

151
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,808
How's the repair going
on your fancy suit?

152
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,277
It's just
minor adjustments.

153
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,347
I'm ready any time!
My armor can go all day.

154
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,849
The best shouldn't have to.

155
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,918
That was the
whole point, huh?

156
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,988
You didn't want to spar.
You wanted to train me.

157
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,857
You're my friend, Tony.

158
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,225
And I want
to keep you alive.

159
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,160
Having repulsor-powered
armor is one thing.

160
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:26,431
Being an undisciplined
wild man in battle will
get you killed.

161
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:28,934
Believe me,
I've seen it before.

162
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,702
I get it.
And thanks, Steve.

163
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:35,006
But my ability to fly
by the seat of my
pants is who I am.

164
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,208
There'd be no iron man
without it.

165
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:37,876
(Explosion)

166
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,611
Whoa! What?
Jarvis: <i> Sir.</i>

167
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,647
(Alarm ringing)
We're under attack!

168
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,648
Jarvis, a little help here?

169
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,453
Jarvis: <i> Intruders, sir.</i>
<i> They have infiltrated</i>
<i> our defense grid.</i>

170
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,688
Who are they?

171
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,191
<i> Jarvis system</i>
<i> shutting down.</i>

172
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,393
(Explosion)
Huh?

173
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,731
Captain America:
What are they after?

174
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,067
They're headed
for my weapons vault!

175
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,635
Let's move!

176
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,170
Right behind, ya!

177
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:07,372
Iron man: Try to keep up.

178
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,411
How'd you get
ahead of me?
Quiet.

179
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:16,915
Hydra trooper:
Prep these weapons
for transport immediately!

180
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:17,282
Hydra.

181
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,385
Okay, here's what
we'll do. Wait!

182
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:21,886
Hey!

183
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:27,325
Do you have any idea
how much I hate it when
people touch my stuff?

184
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,628
(Weapons firing)
Blast him!

185
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,865
The nerve of these guys!

186
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,500
(All groan)

187
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,637
How's that for an entrance?

188
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,871
(Weapons firing)

189
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:40,438
I had an idea.

190
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,675
We could have
taken them all out
in 10 seconds flat!

191
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,911
Did you not see them
ransacking my toy chest?

192
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,813
(Captain America grunts)

193
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,085
Behind you!

194
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,754
Got it!

195
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,723
These guys are
no problem, cap!

196
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,927
Captain America:
Unless they get
a hold of a giant gun!

197
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:03,795
Die, heroes!

198
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,797
Iron man:
I'll handle it.

199
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,067
Eventually.

200
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,438
(Weapons firing)

201
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,283
(All groan)

202
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,586
(Grunts)

203
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,423
(Grunts)

204
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,861
Hurry, Dr. cruler.
Haste makes waste.

205
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,231
I'm hacking as fast
as I can, Dr. fump.

206
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,101
Almost. Got it.

207
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:43,768
There!

208
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,937
We've breached
the magnetic seal,
we're in.

209
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,239
Help me with
the transport case!

210
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,342
Oh, no.
Not in there!

211
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,677
Cap!

212
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,149
Thanks.

213
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,187
They're in the vault.
We gotta stop 'em!

214
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:03,755
(Weapons firing)

215
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,728
Dr. fump: There it is.

216
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,362
The stark repulsor Cannon.

217
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,833
Powered by
its very own arc reactor.

218
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,138
Still a prototype,

219
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,341
but incredibly valuable.

220
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,446
(Beeping)

221
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,615
<i> Report.</i>
<i> What is your status?</i>

222
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,451
We've got
the repulsor Cannon.

223
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,119
Where are you, sir?

224
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:37,756
You were supposed
to be helping against
iron man and captain America.

225
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:38,389
Give me that!

226
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:41,359
Our hydra troopers
are facing two avengers!

227
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,093
We need your help!

228
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,230
<i> I gave you the tools</i>
<i> to aid in your escape.</i>

229
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,098
<i> Now, return to base!</i>

230
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,467
I don't think I like him.

231
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,202
(Both grunt)

232
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,374
Wait. Was this part
of the plan?

233
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,209
(Both scream)

234
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:06,684
(Chuckles)

235
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:12,257
Those hydra fools
don't even realize
they're simply a diversion

236
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,592
for a bigger prize.

237
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,197
(Grunts)

238
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,734
(Weapons firing)

239
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,141
So how about
that bet?

240
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,912
By my count I took down
one more than you did.

241
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:34,612
(Clanks)

242
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,047
And by my count
we're even.

243
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,049
And we've got a lot
of cleaning up to do.

244
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:42,253
Iron man: We'll get 'em
to the brig after we've
accounted for all my weapons,

245
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,956
including the ones
in the vault.

246
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,959
Oh, no.

247
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,294
No!

248
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,130
I should've known.

249
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,398
What is it?

250
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,835
The stark repulsor Cannon,
my latest invention,

251
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:57,402
it's gone!

252
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:01,472
That Cannon is
just as powerful as
my hand-repulsors.

253
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,006
Which means?

254
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,777
Hydra's in possession of
one of my deadliest weapons.

255
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,145
I'm going after it.

256
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:09,647
Let's not be hasty, Tony.
We need a plan.

257
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,816
Iron man:
I don't have time
for a plan!

258
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:16,221
And I don't have
flying boots to
chase after you with.

259
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,457
Uh...

260
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,159
Wake up.

261
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:22,026
I want answers.

262
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,696
Where are you taking
that repulsor Cannon?

263
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,465
Where?
Forget it, hero.

264
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,600
I'll never talk.

265
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:31,402
Hail hydra.
Hail the red...

266
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,171
(Screaming)

267
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,240
(All screaming)

268
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,677
What?

269
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,446
What's going on?

270
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,081
Where am I?

271
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,482
Who am I?

272
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:45,483
Oh, good grief.

273
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,785
What is this place?
I'm freaking out, man!

274
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:50,622
Iron man, come in.
Iron man!

275
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:53,825
Let's get out of here.
Com's jammed. Great.

276
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:58,229
Let's hope there's
a way off this tub.

277
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:08,139
I don't think stark
will mind if I borrow one
of his expensive jets.

278
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,344
That one doesn't
belong to stark.

279
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,856
You've got some
of hawkeye's skill,
but you're not him.

280
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:25,757
Hawkeye doesn't miss.

281
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,227
If I wanted to hit you,
I would have.

282
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:32,230
I've studied all of
the avengers' skills.

283
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,899
Especially yours, captain.

284
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:35,500
Taskmaster.

285
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:38,970
I've read your file.
I know all about
your talents.

286
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,673
Let's see you
imitate this!

287
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:46,311
Okay, you're a little
better than I expected.

288
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,313
(Both grunting)

289
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:49,747
Give it up, captain.

290
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:53,151
I possess the techniques
of the greatest
fighters in the world.

291
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,552
(Groans)

292
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,788
Like iron fist!

293
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,561
My improv catch you
off guard, taskmaster?

294
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,063
Oh, great.
Now I sound like stark!

295
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,831
Hold still, avenger!

296
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,466
(Grunts)

297
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,171
So predictable.

298
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,172
Oh, yeah?

299
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,740
(Grunts)

300
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:21,980
Okay, nice.

301
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:25,350
Kenpo, tae Kwon do
and jujitsu.

302
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,085
My turn!

303
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,658
How'd you like my judo?

304
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,193
I don't!

305
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,834
It's him!
It's iron man!
Do something!

306
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,036
Ugh.
Take the controls!

307
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,572
Eat this!

308
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,980
Iron man: Now this is
the part where I escort
you to the ground.

309
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,548
(Weapon firing)

310
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,786
You hydra goon!

311
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,621
That's my weapon!

312
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,759
And I'm coming
to take it back!

313
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:08,526
Note to self.

314
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,630
Next time I create
a weapon that can
penetrate my force field,

315
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,099
upgrade my force field!

316
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:19,404
Ah! Even through
my armor, this hurts.

317
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,041
(Grunts)

318
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,786
Hydra has big
plans for you, hero,

319
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:38,156
but to me, you're just
a paycheck.

320
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:41,292
Well, it's not gonna
be easy money.

321
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,927
(Groans)

322
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,229
Taskmaster: Not bad.

323
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,904
Wait a sec,
the weight's off!

324
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,506
What did you...
(Screaming)

325
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,714
I'm faster than
you think, captain.

326
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,316
Not only do I know
your fighting style,

327
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:08,753
I know exactly when
you're going
to throw your shield.

328
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,923
And that you
always catch it.

329
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,595
Iron man: Come on.
Don't poop out on me now.

330
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,032
Whoa!

331
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,101
(Iron man groans)

332
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,768
(Clanking)

333
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,004
At least today
can't get any worse.

334
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,040
Iron man:
Cap, you there?

335
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,042
Hydra got away with...

336
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:32,110
Cap?

337
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,144
He's offline.

338
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,812
Jarvis, are you
back on or what?

339
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,647
Jarvis:
<i> Back online, sir!</i>

340
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,950
Get me a trace
on cap, asap.

341
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,685
Jarvis: <i> No GPS location, sir.</i>

342
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:42,920
<i> All of captain Roger's</i>
<i> com devices are offline,</i>

343
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:46,057
<i> and his bio-signs</i>
<i> are not present</i>
<i> on the ship.</i>

344
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,359
Iron man:
Well, then where is he?
You check the hangar?

345
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,760
<i> None of your aircraft</i>
<i> are missing.</i>

346
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:53,331
So if cap didn't leave,
that means he was taken.

347
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,534
The question is, where?

348
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,342
Easy, troops.

349
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,044
Don't want to harm
our prize.

350
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:07,712
He's worth a lot to me.

351
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:10,815
Take him to the
neurotransducer room
for processing.

352
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,519
Keep a guard on
him at all times.
Both: Yes, sir!

353
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:16,854
Make that five guards.

354
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,694
Oh, today is turning out
to be an excellent day indeed.

355
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,297
Now for my own prize.

356
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,934
Iron man's stealth suit.

357
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,636
Ah!

358
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:37,008
I've studied all of
hydra's manuals on
the iron man armor.

359
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,110
With this suit and my skills,

360
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:42,780
I won't have to work for jerks
like the skull anymore.

361
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:46,551
Yeah, once I get rid
of old red and crusty,

362
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,319
I'll take over hydra

363
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,288
and rule this weak world.

364
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,956
(Screaming)

365
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,092
Booby trapped.

366
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,295
I should've known.

367
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,563
Ah.

368
00:19:58,565 --> 00:19:59,096
(Alarm sounding)

369
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:02,200
Automated voice:
<i> Perimeter breach,</i>
<i> incoming vessel.</i>

370
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,203
Ah, speak of the devil.

371
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,391
Taskmaster.

372
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,527
Where is he?

373
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,096
Taskmaster:
That's right, red skull.

374
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:35,933
I did what you've
dreamed of all of these years.

375
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:39,637
I give you
captain America.

376
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:40,271
(Groans)

377
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:43,174
Red skull:
Impressive, taskmaster.

378
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,709
You've executed
your mission

379
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:49,347
and brought me
all I need to create
a new army.

380
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:51,916
(Panting)

381
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,751
New army?

382
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,553
What, you two skull heads

383
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:56,787
can't take over
the world alone?

384
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:02,460
Our soldiers will be superior
to any this world has known.

385
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:05,963
And you are vital
to their creation.

386
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,431
I've finally synthesized

387
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:13,437
and even improved
upon the super soldier
serum that created you.

388
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,208
Your blood is the last
ingredient I needed.

389
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,077
I could've got his blood.
Plenty of it.

390
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,612
Bringing him
here was a mistake.

391
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,180
You just got lucky,
taskmaster.

392
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:25,216
Luck had nothing
to do with it.

393
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:28,319
My mimicry power
is unmatched.

394
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:29,153
True.

395
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:30,655
That is why
we have utilized

396
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:36,327
your unique ability in the
functioning of our new device.

397
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:36,694
What?

398
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:39,930
You made a machine
that can copy people's
skills like I do?

399
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:42,933
Red skull:
The neurotransducer
will replicate

400
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:46,103
not only
the captain's skills,

401
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:49,073
but his tactics
and combat strategies,

402
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:52,977
and then be programed
into my new army.

403
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,545
(Grunts)

404
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,048
Save your strength.
(Clanks)

405
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,884
The restraints
are solid adamantium.

406
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:03,187
Even the hulk
could not break them.

407
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,690
I'd take that bet any day.

408
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:10,294
Captain, in the name
of hydra,

409
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:13,664
I thank you for
your contribution.

410
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,802
(Screaming)

411
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,016
(Thunder rumbling)

412
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:34,251
Iron man:
Gotta be here somewhere.

413
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,354
Come on, come on.

414
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,223
Where's that
security footage?

415
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,027
Yes!

416
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:43,961
Taskmaster?

417
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,664
What was that
creep doing here?

418
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:47,898
Jarvis:
<i> Damage report, sir.</i>

419
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,836
<i> Minimal damage to the hull,</i>
<i> loss of power 22%.</i>

420
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:52,636
<i> Inventory report.</i>

421
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:56,941
<i> The prototype</i>
<i> repulsor Cannon</i>
<i> is missing, and...</i>

422
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:58,075
<i> Oh, dear.</i>

423
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,243
Oh, dear, what?

424
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:04,715
<i> Your iron man mark vi</i>
<i> stealth armor seems</i>
<i> to be missing as well.</i>

425
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,984
Seems to be?
What else can go wrong?

426
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:08,786
<i> I'll try to find</i>
<i> something, sir.</i>

427
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:10,554
I'm not in the mood, Jarvis.

428
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,957
<i> My apologies, sir.</i>

429
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,460
Hmm.
Cap sure went
down easy.

430
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,696
Let's take
a closer look.

431
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,867
You've gotta
be kidding me.

432
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,902
He was faking it
the whole time?

433
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,804
Of all the
reckless plans!

434
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:29,640
<i> Perhaps captain Rogers</i>
<i> has adopted your quote,</i>

435
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:32,009
<i> "fly by the seat</i>
<i> of your pants," methods, sir?</i>

436
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:36,680
Well, cap obviously
is giving me the heads-up
to come after him,

437
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:37,681
and that's what
I'm gonna do.

438
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:40,651
<i> The captain's homing</i>
<i> beacon was destroyed.</i>

439
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:41,385
<i> How will you find him?</i>

440
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:44,054
Actually I was gonna
ask for your help
on that one, Jarvis.

441
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,724
Did taskmaster leave
anything behind?

442
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:48,959
<i> Scanning now, sir.</i>

443
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,662
<i> I've located something.</i>

444
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,998
<i> This a small amount</i>
<i> of mud left in the hangar</i>

445
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,101
<i> that is not from you</i>
<i> or captain Rogers.</i>

446
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,637
Run a full spectrum analysis.

447
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:00,771
<i> Test complete.</i>

448
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:05,943
<i> The composition is made up</i>
<i> of minerals and rare Clay</i>
<i> found in the baltic highlands.</i>

449
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,979
Well, that narrows
it down a little.

450
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,581
Cross-reference
with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s list

451
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,850
of taskmaster's
suspected hideouts.

452
00:24:12,852 --> 00:24:14,018
<i> Right away, sir.</i>

453
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,586
(Scanning)

454
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,656
<i> I have one suspected location.</i>

455
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:21,792
<i> An abandoned military bunker</i>
<i> in Southern Estonia.</i>

456
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,295
That's it.
Hold the fort, Jarvis.

457
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,830
<i> Very good, sir.</i>

458
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,801
(Groaning)

459
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:43,914
Impressive.

460
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,884
A lesser man would
have been obliterated.

461
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:48,919
(Beeping)
Great leader, we did it!

462
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:52,756
We have successfully
recorded captain America's
fighting skills.

463
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:55,759
They are incredibly
clean and organized.

464
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:58,829
This man is truly
a remarkable specimen.

465
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:03,033
The captain's skills
are ready for your use.

466
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:07,238
Excellent.

467
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,607
Your service will
be greatly rewarded.

468
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,409
You could've just paid
to copy my skills.

469
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,913
I'm a better fighter
than that patriot any day.

470
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,047
Doubtful.

471
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,316
You are a mercenary,

472
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:23,354
sorely lacking what
captain America possesses.

473
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:27,525
Courage, resolve and
dedication to an ideal.

474
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:31,395
Qualities perfect
for my new army.

475
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,230
So what happens
to him now?

476
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:37,167
Now I employ the second
function of this device.

477
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:40,070
Not only can it
copy brainwaves,

478
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:44,408
it can write them,
like data onto a hard drive.

479
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,709
(Machine sounding)

480
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,413
Initiating hydra
indoctrination sequence.

481
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:52,249
Your world is about
to change, soldier.

482
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:58,088
Soon you will know
nothing but absolute
obedience to hydra.

483
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,458
And you will answer
only to me!

484
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,160
I wish you had lips, skully,

485
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,763
so you could kiss my
star-spangled...

486
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:07,464
(Screaming)

487
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:14,672
No!

488
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:17,041
No! No!

489
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,178
Hydra troopers:
<i> Hail hydra!</i>
<i> Hail the red skull!</i>

490
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,381
<i> Hail hydra!</i>
<i> Hail the red skull!</i>

491
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:27,117
<i> Hail hydra!</i>
<i> Hail the red skull!</i>

492
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,154
<i> Hail hydra!</i>
<i> Hail the red skull!</i>

493
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:33,324
<i> Hail hydra!</i>
<i> Hail the red skull!</i>

494
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:36,827
<i> Hail hydra!</i>
<i> Hail the red skull!</i>

495
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:38,696
(Chanting continues)

496
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,883
(Red skull laughing)

497
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,326
(Groans)

498
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,765
(Straining)
Get out of my head!

499
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,900
(Groaning)

500
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,505
Resistance is useless.

501
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:26,176
Great leader, your volunteers
have been prepared
for the serum.

502
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:30,214
And here I wanted to watch
captain America's will

503
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:33,984
bend like a weed
beneath my boot.

504
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:34,852
No matter.

505
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:40,090
Taskmaster, stay here
and make sure the captain's
conversion is complete.

506
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:44,128
Do not turn your
back on him for a second.

507
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,964
Whatever you wish.

508
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,966
And his shield.

509
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:50,467
(Grunts)

510
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,870
Very well, great leader.

511
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:57,174
I would curb that sharp tongue
of yours, taskmaster.

512
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,743
Lest it cuts your throat.

513
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:04,748
Hmm.

514
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,284
(Captain America groans)

515
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,957
Jarvis: <i> Atmospheric</i>
<i> re-entry complete.</i>

516
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:17,127
<i> I recommend</i>
<i> initiating deceleration.</i>

517
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,433
<i> Sir? You can slow down</i>
<i> any time.</i>

518
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:23,767
Shouldn't have flown off
without cap.

519
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:27,104
<i> Captain Rogers clearly</i>
<i> allowed himself</i>
<i> to be captured.</i>

520
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:30,274
He was reckless.
That's not how
cap does things.

521
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:31,942
He got himself
in trouble. I know it.

522
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:36,914
<i> Sir, we are approaching</i>
<i> the target coordinates</i>
<i> at an unsafe speed.</i>

523
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,884
Knock, knock.

524
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:43,987
Automated voice:
<i> Intruder alert!</i>

525
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:47,491
Hello, I'm looking
for a friend of mine.

526
00:28:47,493 --> 00:28:50,094
Tall, broad-shouldered,

527
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,361
dressed like a flag.

528
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,330
(Weapons firing)

529
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,698
Destroy him!

530
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,701
You know, you try
and be a nice guy...

531
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,104
(All groan)

532
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:06,276
I'll tell you what,
you fellas take your
10-minute coffee break.

533
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:08,345
I'll go find
my friend.

534
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:09,980
I don't get taskmaster.

535
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:14,151
I mean, he's an accomplished
bad guy, he could build
a lair anywhere.

536
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,920
Why some dingy
cold war bunker?

537
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,422
Jarvis:
<i> Location is everything.</i>

538
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,792
<i> I scan life forms</i>
<i> five meters ahead.</i>

539
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,531
Iron man:
I don't think that's cap.

540
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,632
Ready?
Ready.

541
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,901
Open fire!
(Weapons firing)

542
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,705
Well, you gotta admire
their persistence.

543
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,142
Activate the
sonic disruptors.

544
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:40,811
Jarvis:
<i> Charging now, sir.</i>

545
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,249
(All groan)

546
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:50,988
Sheesh, can we just get
to the boss fight already?

547
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,429
Figures cap'd end up
in the gym.

548
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:05,235
I don't think I wanna work out
on this thing though.

549
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,304
We gotta find him, Jarvis.

550
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,010
Iron man:
Cap! You in here?

551
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,179
Nice pool.

552
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:16,547
Or should I say hot tub.

553
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:22,052
Jarvis: <i> This is an extremely</i>
<i> concentrated form</i>
<i> of hydrochloric acid.</i>

554
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:22,619
<i> Lethal.</i>

555
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,822
I wasn't planning
on taking a dip.

556
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:27,024
Captain America: Stark!
Huh?

557
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,365
Whoa, hey cap!
Same team here!

558
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:40,737
Death to all who
oppose hydra!

559
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:42,105
Oh, great.

560
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:49,112
Aw, no, cap.
What've they done
to you?

561
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,747
They showed me the truth.

562
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:55,385
The strength that will be
our new world order!

563
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:57,588
Whoa!

564
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,427
Jarvis: <i> Biometric scans</i>
<i> indicate the captain's</i>
<i> brain waves</i>

565
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:08,432
<i> have been radically altered</i>
<i> to those of a completely</i>
<i> different person.</i>

566
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,467
Different person? Who?

567
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,336
<i> Greetings, stark.</i>

568
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,304
Oh, him.

569
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:14,938
Terrific.

570
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,809
<i> Allow me introduce you</i>
<i> to my latest agent.</i>

571
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:23,981
Sure, he's wearing less
festive colors, but I think
we've met.

572
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:24,548
<i> No.</i>

573
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,986
<i> This captain America</i>
<i> shares my vision</i>
<i> of the future!</i>

574
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:33,590
Yeah, speaking of vision,
this is strictly pay per view,

575
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:35,359
so get lost!

576
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:36,460
(Grunts)

577
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:39,963
For hydra!
For the red skull!

578
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:44,668
Cap, I thought we decided
you were gonna be like me.

579
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,235
This ain't me.

580
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,472
Everything always has
to be about you, stark.

581
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:51,208
You're selfish and conceited.

582
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,345
Okay. That's it!

583
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:59,249
I don't know what
the skull did to you, buddy,

584
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,184
but you gotta
snap out of it!

585
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,920
(Chuckles)

586
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,354
Ah!

587
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,491
Now stop shooting!
Don't make me hurt you.

588
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:09,026
(Weapon firing)

589
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,928
Don't make me laugh.

590
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:19,436
Okay.
This is your last chance!

591
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,805
I warned you!

592
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,907
Now it gets real!

593
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,879
(Grunts)

594
00:32:28,881 --> 00:32:30,614
Wait. What is that?

595
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,349
Ah!

596
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,720
Laugh that off, stark.

597
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:38,388
Jarvis: <i> Sir, the armor's</i>
<i> been compromised.</i>

598
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,091
<i> We've lost power</i>
<i> to the thrusters.</i>

599
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:42,793
Really, Jarvis?

600
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:43,360
I hadn't noticed.

601
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:47,831
Remind me to remove
stating the obvious
from your programing.

602
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:51,201
Now how do we get
this stupid thing off?

603
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,970
Ah!

604
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,573
Can't reach it...

605
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,912
Automated voice:
<i> Stark armor</i>
<i> security codes, accessed.</i>

606
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:02,813
Bingo.

607
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:07,384
Now you will learn
why hydra shall
reign supreme!

608
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:09,987
Gotcha!

609
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,055
Ah!

610
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,995
(Groans)

611
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:24,534
Nice one, stark,
but you're too late.

612
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:25,268
How's he doing, Jarvis?

613
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,837
Jarvis:
<i> His brainwaves</i>
<i> are normalizing.</i>

614
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:30,874
<i> My scans indicate</i>
<i> captain Rogers is stuck</i>
<i> in a rem-like dream state.</i>

615
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,743
Time to wake up, buddy.

616
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,379
(Groans)

617
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,449
Sorry about that, cap.
You okay?

618
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:39,816
Uh...

619
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:43,587
I just had the worst
nightmare a soldier
could have.

620
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:44,354
Where am I?

621
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,023
Well, you're back
where you belong.

622
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,792
Hydra hijacked
your brain.

623
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,460
Hydra?

624
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,063
You really had me
worried there.

625
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:55,098
Here, lemme give
ya a hand.

626
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,967
(Grunts)
Ah!

627
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:02,172
Automated voice:
<i> Stark encryption decoded.</i>
Verify.

628
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:03,540
<i> Verification complete.</i>

629
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,009
I have you now, iron man.

630
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:08,512
I thought I fixed you!

631
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,147
(Grunts)

632
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:13,984
You did. Don't you know
a spontaneous plan
when you see one?

633
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:16,620
I guess this means
I have to lose?

634
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:18,488
Just make it look good.

635
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:22,192
You are no match
for hydra, fool!

636
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,228
Says you, traitor!

637
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:26,930
Ah!

638
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:30,700
Jarvis:
<i> Sir, system reboot</i>
<i> has begun!</i>

639
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,169
Great news.

640
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:40,710
(Screams) Oh, it hurts!

641
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:46,683
Skull's programing
must be strong for you
to finish your own friend.

642
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:50,754
By the red skull's command,
take me to our great leader.

643
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:54,357
Yeah, well, he's not
gonna be the boss forever.

644
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:58,428
What do you think about
the skull bowing down to us?

645
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,866
Old red and gruesome
would keep you a slave,
I'll make you a partner.

646
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:09,339
Join me and we'll
turn hydra into a twin-headed
dragon and rule it all!

647
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,341
To a new hydra?

648
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,377
To a new hydra!

649
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,013
So when do we
take out the skull?

650
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:19,749
We leave
for Antarctica soon.

651
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,318
Antarctica, eh?

652
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
That's all I needed to hear.

653
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:24,721
(Grunts)

654
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:25,489
Ha!

655
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:27,991
Hmph, so you broke
skull's programing.

656
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,793
He brainwashed
the wrong guy.

657
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,728
You're the one
who wants to be him.

658
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,064
Red skull is nothing to me.

659
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:36,099
Let's see him do this!

660
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:43,640
You gonna hold
your breath forever?

661
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:51,281
I didn't want to interrupt
your terrific acting.

662
00:35:51,283 --> 00:35:54,651
How about you make it easy
on yourself and give up?

663
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,286
I've studied you both!

664
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,053
I know how you fight!

665
00:35:57,055 --> 00:36:00,090
Yeah, but I'm guessing
you don't know how
we fight together.

666
00:36:00,092 --> 00:36:02,292
You know,
I don't think he does.

667
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:04,194
This is gonna be fun.

668
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,164
(Grunts)

669
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:13,336
Really?

670
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,173
You let yourself get
captured and turned
into a psycho?

671
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:18,475
It seemed like
a good idea at the time.

672
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:19,342
Isn't that what you
always say?

673
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:22,746
Oh, I get it. You used
my spontaneous style...
(Groans)

674
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:24,781
...to sneak in and get
brainwashed so you

675
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,884
could find out
where the red skull is.

676
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,352
Stay!

677
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,720
So, I win the bet!

678
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:35,258
No, it was all part of
"the plan," so I won the bet.

679
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,359
Let's just say we're even.

680
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,862
By the way,
what's hydra up to?

681
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,730
You don't wanna know.

682
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:43,767
You sure we shouldn't bring
him along, just in case?

683
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:47,804
He's too dangerous.
We'll have S.H.I.E.L.D.
come and get him.

684
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,876
Just in case.

685
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,446
Don't go anywhere
now, copycat.

686
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:09,559
Iron man:
So, you're not gonna change?

687
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,563
This outfit tricked
taskmaster, it might work
on the skull, too.

688
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:16,266
Stop stealing
my crazy idea schtick!

689
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:17,200
Jarvis:
<i> Sir, I've got something.</i>

690
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:23,440
<i> The missing mark vi's beacon</i>
<i> is nearby but weak,</i>
<i> as if it were shielded.</i>

691
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:25,775
What are you doing?

692
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:29,713
Scanning for the suit of armor
that taskmaster stole from me.

693
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,314
Wow, he really played you.

694
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,216
Were you planning
on telling me?
What?

695
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,418
I mean, I meant
to let him steal it.

696
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,754
Yeah, so we could
trace him.

697
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,055
Right.

698
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,859
All right, fine! Let's just
go bust some skulls.

699
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,972
(Clanking)

700
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,046
Automated voice:
<i> Iron man armor</i>
<i> access granted.</i>

701
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:03,680
Hmm.

702
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:06,349
I think a name change
is in order.

703
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:10,387
I kinda like
the iron master.

704
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:12,222
(Chuckles) Catchy.

705
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,400
So, not a word
about my flying?

706
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:26,069
Your flying is the least
of my worries.

707
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:28,605
Oh, what?
You don't like my plan?

708
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:31,808
It's just a little too "me".

709
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,776
Come on,
it's well thought out.

710
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:35,078
And it's the last thing
red skull would expect.

711
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,548
I figured the wild man
in you would love it.

712
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,484
This is the quietest
you've ever been.

713
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,886
What're you up
to back there?

714
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:43,553
I'm not saying,

715
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:46,990
just in case skull still has
some control over your brain.

716
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,958
You really think
I'd turn on you?

717
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,427
Probably not,
but I like surprises,

718
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:54,464
so I'm working on
a back-up plan just in case
yours doesn't work.

719
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,366
Wow, strategy
from iron man?

720
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:58,735
What I can say,
you're rubbing off on me.

721
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:01,705
Maybe I'll earn
a merit badge.

722
00:39:09,246 --> 00:39:12,449
Got an incoming transmission,
better get outta sight.

723
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:13,883
Right.

724
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:18,154
Automated voice:
<i> Approaching vessel,</i>
<i> identify.</i>

725
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:21,591
This is taskmaster's ship,
vessel 6769.

726
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:25,061
Captain hydra
requesting permission to land.

727
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,831
<i> 6769, maintain your course.</i>

728
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:32,168
Red skull: <i> Captain,</i>
<i> what have you to say?</i>

729
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,636
Hail hydra!

730
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:36,573
<i> Ah. Good.</i>

731
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,408
<i> Where is the taskmaster?</i>

732
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,745
He tried to convince me
to betray you, sir.

733
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:42,379
He failed.

734
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:45,181
<i> His turning</i>
<i> on me was inevitable,</i>

735
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:47,417
<i> but I did not</i>
<i> expect it so soon.</i>

736
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:50,420
I took the liberty
of destroying the traitor.

737
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:52,655
<i> You'll make</i>
<i> a worthy replacement.</i>

738
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:56,960
<i> Perhaps even my</i>
<i> second in command.</i>

739
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:58,862
Iron man: Nice.

740
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:01,231
Hydra has a great
benefit package, man.

741
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,366
Medical, dental,
free mind control.

742
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:06,302
And you're already
wearing one of their
snazzy matching outfits.

743
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:09,639
Hey, how about
you work on that
backup plan?

744
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:17,113
Hydra tech: (Over pa)
<i> Hydra troopers,</i>
<i> mobilize to 031.</i>

745
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:20,316
<i> All flight crews report</i>
<i> to mission briefing.</i>

746
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,919
(Loud whirring)

747
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,257
I don't like this.
They're prepping for
a large scale attack.

748
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:31,795
Well, then it's
a good thing we showed
up for the party.

749
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,632
I can pretend to be a bad guy.
What are you gonna do?

750
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:37,333
I've got something
up my sleeve.

751
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:40,670
I pretty much invented
stealth tech so...

752
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:44,374
That's surprising,
considering how much
you like to be seen.

753
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:46,176
Captain America
cracking jokes.

754
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:50,680
I like it! Now you just have
to work on being funny.

755
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,852
Sir. We're to
escort you to
the great leader.

756
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:57,687
Carry on.

757
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,268
Hey, we've
got an intruder!

758
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,437
Actually, you've got two.

759
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,239
(Grunting)

760
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:19,309
(Chuckling) I knew
you couldn't stay
out of sight long.

761
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:23,446
No, no, it's just you
being a hydra goon
is creeping me out.

762
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:27,784
Yeah, I'm gonna need
a long shower when we're
done with this mission.

763
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,393
Of course, there's a giant
hydra rocket down here.

764
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:40,396
Why can't these guys
just rob jewelry stores?

765
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,100
That doesn't
look any better.

766
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,236
What is it anyway?

767
00:41:46,238 --> 00:41:51,674
Captain America:
It's red skull's new army,
compliments of my blood.

768
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,711
(Loud whirring)

769
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,614
(Grunting)

770
00:41:59,016 --> 00:41:59,716
(Loud shriek)

771
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:02,819
'Cause the world needs more
captain America mutations,

772
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:06,089
freaks and weirdos?
Seriously, hydra.

773
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,334
Iron man: Did you notice
how I didn't just run
out there this time?

774
00:42:18,336 --> 00:42:21,704
Captain America:
Yes, and I was
surprised.

775
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,940
Iron man: You were supposed
to say, "impressed".

776
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:25,508
So, what are they
doing down here?

777
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,411
I don't know,
but that
looks familiar.

778
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,980
Isn't that
one of yours?

779
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,818
Iron man: They're
mass producing my
repulsor Cannon!

780
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,120
I'm gonna sue 'em.

781
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:40,456
Right after I beat 'em
into next Sunday.

782
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,495
That's not the only
thing they've ripped off.

783
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,165
(Loud thud)

784
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,403
(Hissing)

785
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:03,446
Iron man: Is that
a copy of your shield?

786
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:05,214
It's huge.

787
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,827
All right, so what's
our big strategy?

788
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,829
We destroy everything.

789
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:21,664
Now you're talking.

790
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,133
(Grunts)

791
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,374
(Grunting)

792
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,243
This design is ingenious.

793
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:35,878
These weapons will make
hydra unstoppable.

794
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,984
You know, the wattage
settings on these arc
capacitors are all wrong.

795
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:42,418
(Gasps)

796
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,787
Sound the alarm! (Grunts)

797
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,124
No, don't.

798
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,826
(Alarm buzzing)
Argh!

799
00:43:49,828 --> 00:43:51,928
Stark! What the heck
are you doing?

800
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,631
What? I'm blowing stuff up!

801
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:57,867
(Grunts)

802
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,769
Sorry, slowpoke.

803
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,318
(Grunting)

804
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,673
(Loud explosion)

805
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:43,813
Come on, guys. You're
making this too easy!

806
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:48,618
(Beeping)

807
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,854
Know what happens
when you pirate my tech?

808
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:53,623
This.

809
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,858
(Loud explosions)

810
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,995
(Indistinct shouting)

811
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:05,501
You know, I'm kind
of liking this whole
strategy thing.

812
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:06,602
Time for phase two.

813
00:45:06,604 --> 00:45:09,338
Let's take a peek
at what's behind that.

814
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,644
Incoming!

815
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:23,720
(Grunting)

816
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:27,490
(Weapons firing)

817
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,869
I'm disappointed your
programing failed, captain.

818
00:45:39,871 --> 00:45:43,239
You made an excellent
hydra agent.

819
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:48,144
Sorry, there's
no future in it.

820
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,349
(Groaning)

821
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:55,351
Iron man: Or in you, skull.

822
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:57,053
(Sighs)

823
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,858
You will beg me
to spare you,

824
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,494
when I control
the world.

825
00:46:04,496 --> 00:46:07,630
Taskmaster:
Is that so, red skull?

826
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,141
Well, look who put some
iron in their diet.

827
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:21,010
Got to admit, the new
paint job is cool.

828
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:22,178
Excellent, taskmaster.

829
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,314
Now that you've
acquired stark's
ultimate weapon,

830
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:27,617
you will put
it to my use.

831
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:30,586
I'm done taking
orders from you, skull.

832
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:34,791
The iron master is
taking control of hydra!

833
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:37,360
Fool, you work for me!

834
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:39,295
I love it when the
bad guys bicker.

835
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,797
Captain America:
Makes our job easier.

836
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:44,867
Consider this
a hostile takeover.

837
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:50,506
What? (Straining)

838
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:52,241
Can't be. Ugh...

839
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:55,845
I'm unable
attack you. Why?

840
00:46:55,847 --> 00:46:58,915
Because you are
my slave.

841
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,850
Now bow!

842
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:03,119
(Groaning)

843
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:10,493
You thought taking
iron man's stealth armor
was your idea?

844
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:11,661
No.

845
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:15,097
I programed
you to steal it.

846
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:16,532
The memory
was erased,

847
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:20,770
but you also spent time
in my neurotransducer

848
00:47:20,772 --> 00:47:23,673
and were conditioned
to think as I do.

849
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:27,677
Your recent ambition
to take over hydra?

850
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,879
It came from me!

851
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,849
You are no more
than a hired gun

852
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:36,919
and you will obey
my every command.

853
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:37,987
(Groans)

854
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:42,625
Hey, skull, you're kind
of a control freak,
you know that?

855
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,694
For your
first directive,

856
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:49,599
destroy iron man
and captain America!

857
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:53,870
(Grunting)

858
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,242
No more
playing army, skull.

859
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:02,845
You have yet
to see my army.

860
00:48:02,847 --> 00:48:07,416
Or should I say
"our" army?

861
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,586
(Loud footsteps approaching)

862
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:19,662
So, do we do this
your way or my way?

863
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:21,931
Not sure it's
gonna matter.

864
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,102
Crush them!

865
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,174
Only chance is
to keep moving!

866
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:34,877
Clear a path,
I'll cover you!

867
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:38,014
(Loud explosion)
Oh!

868
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:40,483
(Groaning)

869
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,362
Come on.

870
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,632
I'm okay.
Let's run for it!

871
00:48:56,634 --> 00:49:00,903
What are you gawking
at, idiots? Finish them!

872
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,707
(Loud explosion)

873
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,744
How many of these
things are there?

874
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:11,147
Got to get past 'em.
Come on!

875
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,562
Let's see you block this.

876
00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:28,230
(Growling)

877
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:37,506
Oh, no.

878
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,111
This way!

879
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:46,015
You know, I really could
use some boot jets.

880
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:48,050
(Panting)

881
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,457
Bad enough these
things are strong!

882
00:49:54,459 --> 00:49:55,558
But they
can fight, too!

883
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,226
Worse than that,

884
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,962
they fight smart.

885
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,932
(Grunting)

886
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:04,567
(Gasps)

887
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,904
You don't recognize
their style?

888
00:50:08,906 --> 00:50:11,507
Besides being armed
with your Cannon,

889
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:16,612
my ubermen have
been enhanced with
my super soldier serum

890
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:20,916
and programed
with the captain's
superior combat skills.

891
00:50:20,918 --> 00:50:25,788
All of his years of training
are going to pay off

892
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:27,223
for hydra!

893
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:30,292
Come on, Tony,
I think it's
time to go.

894
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,961
Whoa!

895
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:39,301
Huh?

896
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:40,703
Okay. My turn, cap.

897
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:43,639
I'll clear us a path
out of here!

898
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:47,176
(Loud explosion)

899
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,216
(Grunts)

900
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,953
(Grunting)

901
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,556
(Groaning)

902
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:04,060
In a way, it will be
captain America's army

903
00:51:04,062 --> 00:51:06,328
that will sweep
across the globe,

904
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:12,134
led by my
unquestioningly loyal
field commander,

905
00:51:12,136 --> 00:51:14,336
the iron master!

906
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,840
How are you
coming with that plan?

907
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:20,409
Plan? Oh, it's
incoming now.

908
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:23,279
And it's more
like a bomb.
Bomb?

909
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:25,147
(Low rumbling)

910
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:27,883
(All gasps)

911
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,488
(Screaming)

912
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,424
A gamma bomb.

913
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,026
Somebody call
for back-up?

914
00:51:37,028 --> 00:51:38,928
Late for the
party, big guy.

915
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:43,232
No, you're
just in time.
Hulk. Smash.

916
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,801
(Roaring)

917
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,775
(Weapons firing)

918
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:55,644
(Growling)

919
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,482
Captain America:
Got to admit, nice plan.

920
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,686
I hadn't counted
on the monster.

921
00:52:03,688 --> 00:52:06,288
Delay them as
long as you can.

922
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,358
I will initiate
the final phase.

923
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:11,560
By your command.

924
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,663
I'm going after red skull.

925
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:18,200
I got a score
to settle, too!

926
00:52:27,744 --> 00:52:29,411
What am I supposed to do?

927
00:52:29,413 --> 00:52:30,513
You're doing it!

928
00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:32,648
Hoping you'd say that!

929
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,517
Now where's...

930
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,318
Found him!

931
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,325
(Glass cracking)

932
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:45,294
(Hulk roaring)

933
00:52:47,063 --> 00:52:49,198
First you rip off
cap, now me?

934
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,667
There's not an original
bone in your body.

935
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:55,704
There's no such thing as
an original idea, stark.

936
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:59,909
Iron man: So let's go
with the classics.

937
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,549
Jarvis! Initiate
the remote!

938
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:07,349
Shut down his armor!

939
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:11,921
Jarvis: <i> Taskmaster has</i>
<i> installed a hydra encryption</i>
<i> device to prevent such action.</i>

940
00:53:11,923 --> 00:53:14,089
<i> It will take</i>
<i> minutes to override.</i>

941
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:15,524
(Loud buzzing)

942
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,359
We don't have minutes.

943
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,901
Computer:
<i> Rocket fueling is complete.</i>

944
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:28,971
Initiate the
launch sequence.

945
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,473
<i> Pre-launch protocol</i>
<i> has begun.</i>

946
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:33,209
(Rapid beeping)

947
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:41,383
Captain America:
Hydra cap reporting for duty.

948
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,153
You can't win, skull!

949
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:47,890
Oh, I've learned how
to beat you, captain.

950
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:50,259
Don't play
by the rules.

951
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,931
And yet you keep losing!

952
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:57,967
Red skull: Not this time!

953
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:04,673
And through my
defeats, I've learned
something else from you,

954
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:07,710
always have
a final plan.

955
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:14,083
The rocket is filled
with the super soldier serum
I used on my troops,

956
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:17,419
complete with
your blood sample.

957
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,256
Millions will soon
be transformed

958
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:23,692
into ultra-powered
soldiers under my control.

959
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:26,562
The planet will
be reshaped

960
00:54:26,564 --> 00:54:29,431
into the image of hydra.

961
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,568
(Grunting)

962
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,207
Get off of me!

963
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,410
Give me that!

964
00:54:41,412 --> 00:54:42,778
(Snarling)

965
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,053
How do you like it?

966
00:54:51,055 --> 00:54:52,554
(Groaning)

967
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,157
Okay! I'm offended.

968
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:59,228
You wanna fight?
I'm right here.

969
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,696
Come out, taskmaster.

970
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:02,698
Show me
what you got.

971
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,432
Taskmaster: Over here.

972
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:05,634
(Loud explosion)
(Iron man grunts)

973
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,437
I know all
your tricks, stark.

974
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:11,807
You're looking at
the new iron man!

975
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,742
Jarvis, get me
into that suit!

976
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:16,011
Jarvis: <i> Your decryption</i>
<i> hacks are working,</i>

977
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:17,313
<i> but very slowly, sir.</i>

978
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:18,881
Keep trying.
In the meantime,

979
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:21,383
maybe I can hack taskmaster!

980
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,653
(Energy pulsating)
(Groaning)

981
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:28,123
That...
That won't stop me!

982
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:28,891
Wasn't meant to.

983
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:31,760
I freed you from
the skull's programing.

984
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:34,563
You don't have to
serve him anymore.

985
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:35,831
Really?

986
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,133
Appreciate it, stark!

987
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:41,303
Hey, you owe me!

988
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:45,007
I'll show you
what I owe you!

989
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:46,809
Jarvis! It's now or never!

990
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:51,613
Jarvis: <i> Sir, I was able</i>
<i> to access and deactivate</i>
<i> his armor's energy shields.</i>

991
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:54,650
That's all I need!
Charge up the hull.

992
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:56,752
Let's give him a shock!

993
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,154
(Screaming)

994
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:04,626
I can't move!

995
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:05,961
What have you done?

996
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:07,796
Ha! Taught you a lesson.

997
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:10,966
Your fist is no
match for my brain.

998
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:14,336
(Groans)

999
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:16,238
So much for
the iron copycat.

1000
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,375
Jarvis, pinpoint
cap for me.

1001
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:25,914
Hydra is making hulk mad!

1002
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:28,684
Hydra won't like hulk mad!

1003
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,860
Hulk smash!

1004
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,096
Why, you...

1005
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:43,966
Come here, ugly!

1006
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,805
(Roaring)

1007
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,047
(Beeping)

1008
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,103
Your plan
ends now, skull.

1009
00:57:24,007 --> 00:57:26,041
Does it, captain?

1010
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:36,985
I have decided
it is better you are
not with hydra, captain.

1011
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:40,088
Your compassion
is a weakness.

1012
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,725
Tell it to my shield!

1013
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:48,697
Ha! The great
captain America
has missed.

1014
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:49,798
It was bound
to happen.

1015
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,403
Without your
precious shield,
you're finished.

1016
00:57:54,405 --> 00:57:56,305
I guess you're right.

1017
00:57:56,307 --> 00:57:58,807
Computer:
<i> Launch sequence</i>
<i> will commence in...</i>

1018
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:03,412
<i> 30, 29, 28,</i>
<i> 27, 26, 25...</i>

1019
00:58:03,414 --> 00:58:04,413
Red skull:
You've lost your mind!

1020
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:11,119
My rocket will spread
hydra's destiny all over
your beloved homeland.

1021
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:14,223
Captain America: If your
rocket makes it that far.

1022
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,592
Computer:
<i> 14, 13, 12...</i>

1023
00:58:16,594 --> 00:58:18,060
Guess I didn't
miss after all.

1024
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:21,129
Once in a while, you
got to do what you said,

1025
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:22,431
"not play by the rules."

1026
00:58:22,433 --> 00:58:26,535
Computer:
<i> Five, four, three, two...</i>

1027
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:29,938
<i> One, ignition.</i>
(Loud explosion)

1028
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,712
Captain!

1029
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,516
Captain America:
Stark! Where are you?

1030
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:16,818
We have to get
out of here, now!

1031
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,187
Stark, do you read? Over!

1032
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:28,964
Hulk? This is cap.
Can you hear me?

1033
00:59:47,784 --> 00:59:49,518
(Grunting)

1034
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:55,057
Stark! Where are you?

1035
00:59:57,694 --> 00:59:59,895
Hello!
Ah, you're
early this time.

1036
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:02,164
All according
to my plan.

1037
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:03,732
After you.

1038
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,719
Hulk, get out, now!

1039
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:31,026
Working on it.

1040
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,450
Hulk tired
of hydra.

1041
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:00,689
Hulk smash!

1042
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:10,666
Oh, come on!

1043
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:19,207
(Beeping)

1044
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:28,617
Iron man: That was
closer than usual.

1045
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,086
I hope hulk made
it out of there.

1046
01:01:31,088 --> 01:01:32,354
See if you
can reach him.

1047
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:34,723
Big green,
do you copy?

1048
01:01:34,725 --> 01:01:36,825
Jarvis: <i> Hulk's com</i>
<i> is unresponsive, sir.</i>

1049
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:40,696
<i> Also, the arc reactor</i>
<i> suffered critical</i>
<i> damage in the escape</i>

1050
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:43,532
<i> and will be</i>
<i> shutting down now.</i>

1051
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:45,400
Are you kidding me?

1052
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:48,070
Uh, stark?

1053
01:01:48,072 --> 01:01:49,037
What's happening?

1054
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:52,574
Iron man: Experiencing some
technical difficulties.

1055
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,310
So, this isn't
part of the ride?

1056
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:56,545
Apparently, it is today.

1057
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:58,814
You gonna do
something about this?

1058
01:01:58,816 --> 01:02:01,883
Jarvis! Reroute power
from the emergency reserve.

1059
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,251
Jarvis: <i> As I informed</i>
<i> you earlier, sir,</i>

1060
01:02:03,253 --> 01:02:06,722
<i> the reserve was</i>
<i> damaged in your battle</i>
<i> with captain America.</i>

1061
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:09,925
Iron man:
Don't tell me that!
Options! I need options!

1062
01:02:09,927 --> 01:02:12,160
<i> Dreadfully sorry, sir,</i>
<i> there are none.</i>

1063
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:13,462
Captain America:
So are you fixing this?

1064
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:17,733
Iron man: As luck would
have it, not this time!

1065
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:18,500
Stark!
This is gonna hurt!

1066
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:21,670
Yeah, well, you're
the one who's always
supposed to be prepared!

1067
01:02:21,672 --> 01:02:25,507
Pull a parachute
out of your
shield or something!

1068
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,309
Stark!

1069
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:31,246
(Hulk shouting)

1070
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:40,822
Oh, so that's
what that feels like.

1071
01:02:40,824 --> 01:02:41,256
Yeah.

1072
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,059
That's two
you owe me.

1073
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,328
(Loud explosion)

1074
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:49,631
Iron man: So much for
hydra's big scheme.

1075
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:55,070
See? Not all plans
work out, cap.

1076
01:02:55,072 --> 01:02:57,672
Mine did.
(Sighs)

1077
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,477
(Red skull grunting)

1078
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,152
Perimeter secure, sir.

1079
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:14,823
You failed, skull.

1080
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:18,226
Your need to control
captain America doomed us.

1081
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,597
It was your treachery
that doomed us.

1082
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:26,668
And for that you
will be eliminated.

1083
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:28,737
Oh!

1084
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:37,712
Oh, stark, you're
a piece of work.

1085
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:41,716
(Grunts)

1086
01:03:41,718 --> 01:03:44,653
Huh?
S.H.I.E.L.D. agent:
<i> Attention, hydra!</i>

1087
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:45,420
<i> This is S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

1088
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:49,291
<i> Drop your weapons,</i>
<i> or you will be fired upon!</i>

1089
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,394
(Taskmaster laughing)

1090
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:05,207
Come on out, cap.

1091
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:10,011
For better or worse.
I do like the colors.

1092
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:15,183
And the boot jets,
of course.

1093
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:18,086
Both: Ready? Avengers attack!

1094
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:20,589
(Screaming)

1095
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:26,695
I'm going in.

1096
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:29,364
Roger that, cap.
I'm on your wing.

1097
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:31,833
Whoa...

1098
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,935
Iron man: I'll get him.

1099
01:04:36,272 --> 01:04:37,873
(Grunts)

1100
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:40,642
Wow. You both missed me.

1101
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:41,710
I don't see how.

1102
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:44,512
You're so big,
green and ugly.

1103
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,451
Hulk: Wow! You really
can't hit me.

1104
01:04:49,453 --> 01:04:51,353
Come on, stark.

1105
01:04:51,355 --> 01:04:53,688
Iron patriot, incoming.

1106
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:02,464
Now you're
getting it, cap.

1107
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,201
That tickles. Stop it.

1108
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,974
Yeah, you two are lame.

1109
01:05:12,976 --> 01:05:15,176
What's this
about, anyway?

1110
01:05:15,178 --> 01:05:17,779
I bet cap if he
fought more like me,

1111
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:19,881
spontaneous
and unpredictable,
he'd do better.

1112
01:05:19,883 --> 01:05:24,686
And I bet Tony if he was
little more tactical and
strategic in mind like me,

1113
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:26,688
he'd do better.

1114
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,063
Oh, no.

1115
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,933
Cap, those are
heat seekers!

1116
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:38,867
And they've locked onto me.

1117
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:42,103
Captain America:
Sorry, Tony. I was just
winging it, like you do.

1118
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,506
Iron man:
Don't worry, I got this.

1119
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:46,174
Just need some
room to maneuver.

1120
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:48,710
Captain America:
You're running out of
room to maneuver.

1121
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:51,579
Then it's time for
some strategy.

1122
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:57,285
Hmm...

1123
01:05:57,287 --> 01:06:00,422
Captain America:
They're closing in!

1124
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:01,389
I see!

1125
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,591
Captain America:
There's one on your six!

1126
01:06:03,593 --> 01:06:05,293
Got it!

1127
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,896
Captain America:
Only one left, I'll get it!

1128
01:06:07,898 --> 01:06:09,698
Iron man: Wait, no!
(Grunts)

1129
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,900
(Both screaming)

1130
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:14,169
(Hulk laughing)

1131
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:15,971
(Both groaning)

1132
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:18,106
So, you both lost?

1133
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:19,908
We both won!
We both won!

1134
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:22,210
You're both good
at what you do.

1135
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:23,912
Why don't you just
stick to that?

1136
01:06:23,914 --> 01:06:28,750
You know, he's right.
You're pretty good at
all that plotty planny stuff.

1137
01:06:28,752 --> 01:06:32,253
And you're fairly decent
at shooting from the hip.

1138
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,596
We never talked
about what I'm good at.

1139
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:43,365
Smashing.

1140
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:46,201
Now, let's go eat.

1141
01:06:46,203 --> 01:06:50,739
I could go for some
raw menu macrobiotic
organic tofu.

1142
01:06:50,741 --> 01:06:52,941
I have no idea
what you just said.

1143
01:06:52,943 --> 01:06:55,043
I'm a meat
and potatoes
kind of guy.

1144
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:59,114
Hulk saved you
and hulk wants pie.

1145
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,288
Yeah, okay.
I could go for pie.

1146
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,057
Pie it is.

1147
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:11,860
(Hulk roaring)
