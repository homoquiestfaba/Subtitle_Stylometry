at the beginning of the third.

656
00:53:46,703 --> 00:53:50,764
It's, uh, a kit from RadioShack.

657
00:53:50,841 --> 00:53:52,775
Oh.

658
00:53:53,844 --> 00:53:57,871
Seven, eight, nine.

659
00:53:57,948 --> 00:53:59,916
Ten for ten.
They were all assigned.

660
00:53:59,983 --> 00:54:02,543
Assigned to what?
Melting down police issues.

661
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:04,746
There must have been
over 8,000 handguns.

662
00:54:04,821 --> 00:54:07,756
Maybe they did some kind of swap,
fake ones for the real thing.

663
00:54:07,824 --> 00:54:09,655
<i>We're talking serious money here.</i>

664
00:54:09,726 --> 00:54:12,126
Who was in charge
of destroying the guns?

665
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:14,129
- Commissioner Daniels.
- Big surprise.

666
00:54:14,197 --> 00:54:16,256
<i>[ Devon ]
Doesn't mean she
knew anything about it.</i>

667
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,665
They may have acted entirely on their own.

668
00:54:18,735 --> 00:54:21,568
You don't know the system like I do.
They would have needed help higher up.

669
00:54:24,308 --> 00:54:26,242
Thank you, Karen.

670
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:33,409
KITT has just completed
a workup off Shawn's memory.

671
00:54:33,483 --> 00:54:36,680
Looks like he
matched that face to a file.

672
00:54:36,753 --> 00:54:39,847
- So what's this guy's real name?
- Watts.

673
00:54:39,923 --> 00:54:41,857
Tommy Watts.

674
00:54:41,925 --> 00:54:43,859
Former homicide detective.

675
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:47,192
Explains why he didn't show up
in current personnel files.

676
00:54:47,264 --> 00:54:50,700
He served in the Philippine War in '93,
before he joined the P.D.

677
00:54:50,767 --> 00:54:52,928
Yeah. A weapon specialist.

678
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:55,471
Says here
he worked directly under Daniels.

679
00:54:55,539 --> 00:54:58,269
Not bad.
At least KITT goes out with a bang.

680
00:55:00,844 --> 00:55:04,837
The 4000 will be fully operational
tomorrow morning,
just ahead of our deadline.

681
00:55:04,915 --> 00:55:07,475
I'd say the bang is premature.

682

<i>KITTstill has plenty left to do.</i>

683
00:55:10,454 --> 00:55:13,514
Do we have an address for Mr. Watts?

684
00:55:15,225 --> 00:55:19,662
Hey, Charlie, you should've seen
the car I gave a jump to today.

685
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:24,190
The whole dash was decked out with
TV screens and a computer console.

686
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:26,394
Must have been that
new 'Vette I've been reading about.

687
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:29,962
No. This was an old '57 Chevy,
cherried out all the way.

688
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,565
The damn thing had
artificial intelligence too.

689
00:55:32,643 --> 00:55:35,373
It was transferring
some kind of data...

690
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:39,142
<i>when it switches over to the ball game
and gives me the score.</i>

691
00:55:43,887 --> 00:55:48,153
You're telling me they tapped
into the police mainframe?

692
00:55:48,225 --> 00:55:51,956
The log showed a global download
of the personnel files.

693
00:55:52,029 --> 00:55:55,521
It's only a matter of time
before they put it together.

694
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,695
A complete loss of memory, huh?

695
00:56:21,558 --> 00:56:24,891
I don't enjoy being tense.

696
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,121
I'm sure there's a solution.

697
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:32,464
Yes, sir, there is.

698
00:56:40,477 --> 00:56:45,938
Sir, would you like me to engage
my virtual reality mode?
Why not?

699
00:56:51,321 --> 00:56:54,222
It's very impressive, but I really think
we ought to slow down.

700
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:56,225
There is no need for concern.

701
00:56:56,293 --> 00:56:58,761
I'm programmed to cruise

703
00:57:01,031 --> 00:57:06,094

calculates at 243 kilometers per hour.

704
00:57:13,243 --> 00:57:15,302
Look out!

705
00:57:17,814 --> 00:57:20,146
I assume you have an explanation.

706
00:57:20,217 --> 00:57:24,085
We would've sustained no damage
whatsoever by striking that animal.

707
00:57:26,823 --> 00:57:28,814
It's a small fix.

708
00:57:46,576 --> 00:57:50,603
Overall, what do you think?
I'm not looking for praise, Devon.

709
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,945
I want your honest opinion.
It means a lot to me.

710
00:57:54,017 --> 00:57:56,076
You've done a remarkable job.

711
00:57:56,153 --> 00:58:00,055
It meets and, in most cases, exceeds
all our technical criteria.

712
00:58:00,123 --> 00:58:03,024
I know we do things
very differently,

713
00:58:03,093 --> 00:58:06,062
but believe it or not,
our goal is the same.

714
00:58:06,129 --> 00:58:10,190
KITT was an exceptional car
for his time, no question about it.

715
00:58:10,267 --> 00:58:12,667
It's just that the time has come
to pass the baton.

716
00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:17,605
I agree that the Knight 4000
is superior in every way.

717
00:58:17,674 --> 00:58:20,541
Except one:
It lacks KITT's humanity.

738
01:00:29,673 --> 01:00:32,767

There was no alternative.
They'll assume you drowned
