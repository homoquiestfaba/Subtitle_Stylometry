1
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,913
<i>I grew up slowly, beside the tides</i>
<i>and marshes... </i>

2
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,236
<i>... of a Carolina sea island. </i>

3
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,668
<i>We lived in a small, white house... </i>

4
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,394
<i>... won by my</i>
<i>great-great-grandfather... </i>

5
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,552
<i>... Winston Shadrach Wingo... </i>

6
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,916
<i>... in a horseshoe game. </i>

7
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,874
Last one around the tree is a ninny!

8
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,233
Joop, Joop! Come here.

9
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,032
Boys, boys! Careful, now.

10
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,390
- I'll race you, Tom.
- Wait up, Luke.

11
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,915
<i>There are families</i>
<i>who live their entire lives... </i>

12
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,076
<i>... without a single thing of interest</i>
<i>happening to them. </i>

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,952
Don't run so fast, Tom!

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,798
<i>I've always envied those families. </i>

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,036
Luke, mind you,
don't torment that dog.

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,753
It's my dog!

17
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,474
Tom, you're gonna step on him.
He's only a pup!

18
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,948
Here, Joop. Come here!

19
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,354
Mom, did you see me run?

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,312
Savannah, you want a bean?

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,558
Boys, you want a bean?

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,031
Quit squealing, Savannah.

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,798
You're next, Tom.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,629
<i>The child of a beautiful woman,</i>
<i>I was also a shrimper's son... </i>

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,558
<i>... in love with the shape of boats. </i>

26
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,034
Luke, he's pushing me.

27
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,958
I'm not pushing her!

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,997
<i>As a small boy, I loved to navigate</i>
<i>my father's shrimp boat... </i>

29
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,760
<i>... between the sandbars. </i>

30
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,674
<i>I suppose Henry Wingo would have</i>
<i>made a pretty good father... </i>

31
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,440
<i>... if he hadn't been</i>
<i>such a violent man. </i>

32
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,628
<i>From my mother, I inherited</i>
<i>a love of language... </i>

33
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,070
<i>... and an appreciation of nature. </i>

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,470
<i>She could turn a walk</i>
<i>around the island... </i>

35
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,797
<i>... into a voyage of purest discovery. </i>

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,472
<i>As a child, I thought she was</i>
<i>the most extraordinary woman on earth. </i>

37
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,236
<i>I wasn't the first son to be wrong</i>
<i>about his mother. </i>

38
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,112
I am sick and tired...

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,676
...of you never showing me
any respect in my own house.

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,071
<i>I don't know when my parents began</i>
<i>their war against each other. </i>

41
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,310
<i>But I do know the only prisoners they</i>
<i>took were their children. </i>

42
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,795
Wait, you guys.
My shoes are falling off!

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,989
Keep up, Savannah.

44
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,352
<i>When my brother, sister and I needed</i>
<i>to escape, we developed a ritual. </i>

45
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,152
<i>We found a silent, soothing world</i>
<i>where there was no pain. </i>

46
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,113
<i>A world without mothers or fathers. </i>

47
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,554
<i>We would make a circle</i>
<i>bound by flesh... </i>

48
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,392
<i>... and blood... </i>

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,039
<i>... and water. </i>

50
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,599
<i>And only when we felt our lungs betray</i>
<i>us, would we rise toward the light... </i>

51
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,351
<i>... and the fear of what lay in wait</i>
<i>for us above the surface. </i>

52
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,839
<i>All this was a long time ago... </i>

53
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,474
<i>... before I chose not</i>
<i>to have a memory. </i>

54
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,159
Daddy!

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,435
I think something bit me!

56
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,399
Mr. Brighton, are you selling dope
to my girls again?

57
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,278
Stop bugging us, Dad.

58
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,994
- Bye, Mr. Brighton.
- Come on in. It's getting late!

59
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,428
It's a conch.

60
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,557
Bring him home.
I'll send him to college!

61
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,239
How do you know it's a boy?

62
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,032
Well, let's examine him.

63
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,748
Girls, have I ever told you
the facts of life?

64
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,951
Oh, no. Not this again.

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,476
Stay away from boys because
they're disgusting beasts...

66
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,678
...that pee on bushes
and pick their noses.

67
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,474
- Gross, Dad!
- That's completely gross.

68
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,915
Anyway, I'm not gonna stay
away from boys.

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,588
That's the spirit. Never do
what parents tell you.

70
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,916
Hey, Mom, look what I found!

71
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,795
If you don't quit smoking, you'll die.
That's what they told me at school.

72
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,479
Well, no more school for you.

73
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,398
Mom, Dad's smoking again.

74
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,950
Oh, no. Well, you know what to do
with that. Put it in the sink.

75
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,513
Give me a kiss.

76
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,559
I wanna play.

77
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,196
You look tired, doctor.
I'll fix you a drink.

78
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,870
That would be so nice.
It's been one of those days.

79
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,719
Hey, honey, it's tough work
being a saint.

80
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,509
Sal, can you get it?

81
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,875
Something smells good.

82
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,878
- Hey, Dad. Come and play with us.
- Later.

83
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,719
- Your mother, from her car.
- I'm not here.

84
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,592
Okay, Lila. She's coming over.

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,709
Why didn't you tell her we were
under quarantine?

86
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,990
She said she had to see you.

87
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,999
- Dad, they won't share.
- Work it out, girls.

88
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,589
She said it was urgent.
She was crying.

89
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,075
I can't remember a day
when Lila wasn't crying.

90
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,271
Be nice to her, Tom.

91
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,550
I hate my mother, Sally.
I enjoy hating her.

92
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,910
Don't kill one of the few
pleasures in my life.

93
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,439
Can we talk about
something else?

94
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,829
- Sure, what?
- Us.

95
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,830
I need a stiff drink
for that conversation.

96
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,269
Girls?

97
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,028
- Girls!
- What?

98
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,629
- Anyone want to sit on Daddy's lap?
- No!

99
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,758
- There's money involved.
- Okay!

100
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,837
I'm gonna ask you
a serious question.

101
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,713
- I want you to answer honestly.
- I know the question.

102
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,354
Who's the greatest human being
on this earth?

103
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,875
Mama? I've gotta develop
some new routines.

104
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,752
Come on, everybody. Pick up, now.

105
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,518
Come on, wash. It's bath time.

106
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,188
Gotta pass inspection.
Lila's coming over.

107
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,437
Lila, Lila, Lila.
Why can't we call her Grandma?

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,631
- You'll know when you're a grandma.
- I will?

109
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,432
Pick up and get into that tub.

110
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,278
How does bouillabaisse
sound to you?

111
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,675
Yuck! Can't we ever have normal food?

112
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,155
Do you think we could talk seriously?

113
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,839
Not now, Sally.
My mother's close.

114
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,036
Can't you tell?
The air stopped moving.

115
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,239
Sometimes I think what you need is
a good smack across your mouth.

116
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,159
Here she is. Sally, tie
this garlic around my neck.

117
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,237
Do we have to invite her for dinner?

118
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,510
She won't stay. You know that.

119
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,988
Then let's invite her.

120
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,949
Lila.

121
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,792
Hello, Sally, dear.

122
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,557
Those shrubs need watering.

123
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,671
Yeah. I have to do that.

124
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,595
- You're looking well, Lila.
- Don't be glib, Tom.

125
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,553
- Will you have dinner with us?
- No. I can't stay long.

126
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,159
What a shame.

127
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,270
- Where are the children?
- They're taking baths. Why?

128
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,799
I have some bad news.

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,195
They cancelled
your American Express card?

130
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,994
Your sister tried to
kill herself again.

131
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,397
You wanna make another joke?

132
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,873
- Oh, my God, Lila. When?
- I'm not sure.

133
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,475
She was in a coma when they found her.

134
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,713
How is she now?

135
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,990
She's alive, thank God.

136
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,033
I spoke to her psychiatrist.

137
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,356
Some Jewish woman in New York.

138
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,277
She wants one of us to go up there
now. I told her you'd go.

139
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,994
If she's a shrink and a Jew,
you can't go?

140
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,671
I didn't say that. I'm just not
entirely sure I'd be welcome.

141
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,431
Savannah will probably blame me.
My children blame me for everything.

142
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,432
Do I detect a note
of guilt, Mama?

143
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,319
Don't give me that
psychological horseshit.

144
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,559
Why don't you just say it? I'm
responsible for all your problems...

145
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,239
...including you not having a job.

146
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,634
Let's hit way below the belt!

147
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,195
Don't pretend you didn't start this.

148
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,995
I just can't go right now. It's your
stepfather's birthday this weekend.

149
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,431
I can't go either. I gotta
wash out Sally's pantyhose.

150
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,874
I'm going to the cleaners.

151
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,674
Why don't you get a job
as a standup comedian?

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,359
It pays better than teaching did.

153
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,318
Which was far beneath me. Right?

154
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,919
Beneath your abilities, yes.

155
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,998
What do you know about my
abilities, for chrissake?

156
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,948
Just stop it, now, the both of you!

157
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,750
I'm sorry you're hurting.

158
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,992
You wanted to talk?

159
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,792
It can wait.

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,399
Let's walk.

161
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,636
Tell me what you're thinking.

162
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,273
I'm trying to calculate the exact
moment everything got so fucked up.

163
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,152
I'm also worried the Braves
are gonna finish last.

164
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,952
I don't feel like laughing.

165
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,152
Oh, come on, Sally. Come on.

166
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,072
Do you know that this is the first
time you have touched me in weeks?

167
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,275
My life's a mess, Sally.

168
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,040
Our life's a mess, Tom.

169
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,588
Look, there's the Big Dipper.

170
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,118
I don't give a shit about
the Big Dipper!

171
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,155
Damn it, I care about us.

172
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,358
I care about why you keep
pushing me away.

173
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,511
I thought you said this could wait.

174
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,230
I've been waiting for two
years, Tom. Ever since Luke died.

175
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,431
I know how you feel about him.

176
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,473
I just don't know how you feel
about me anymore.

177
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,838
Don't take it personally. I don't
know how I feel about anything anymore.

178
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,390
God, you're pathetic.

179
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,678
Don't blame it on us.
Blame it on Con Ed!

180
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,356
Get this truck out of here.

181
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,716
Come on, I'm in a hurry!

182
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,399
I've got a doctor's appointment.

183
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,200
Hey, lady! What are you
honking at me for?

184
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,155
<i>It was only my sister who could force</i>
<i>me to come to this God-awful city. </i>

185
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,637
<i>This city that roars down on you. </i>

186
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,234
<i>She loved it all. </i>
<i>The muggers, the winos... </i>

187
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,989
<i>... the bag ladies,</i>
<i>the wall-to-wall noise. </i>

188
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,352
<i>She loved it because it had nothing</i>
<i>to do with our childhood. </i>

189
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,878
<i>Luke and I hated it for</i>
<i>exactly the same reason. </i>

190
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,794
You're...

191
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,269
Hello.

192
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,830
I'm Dr. Lowenstein.
You must be Tom.

193
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,714
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,718
Why don't you come in?

195
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,712
You can leave your things there.

196
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,718
Am I supposed to lie down on the couch,
or are we gonna make polite chitchat?

197
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,990
How about a cup of coffee?

198
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,191
Oh, we're gonna make
polite chitchat first.

199
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,072
Was that yes or no to the coffee?

200
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,793
It's a yes, ma'am.

201
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,678
Cream and sugar?
And you don't have to call me ma'am.

202
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,872
That's my good home-training,
and I'm a little nervous.

203
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,433
Cream, no sugar.

204
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,675
Why do you think you're nervous?

205
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,759
I get nervous every time my sister
tries to kill herself. It's a quirk.

206
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,313
A quirk?

207
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,398
I'm sorry. I was being cynical.
It's a family trait.

208
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,318
Oh, I don't think Savannah's cynical.

209
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,671
No? She's suicidal.

210
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,950
I wish she was cynical.

211
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,354
How is my sister?

212
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,318
She's out of physical danger, but...

213
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,953
When can I see her?

214
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,639
You have to wait until tomorrow.

215
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,909
Why can't I go now?

216
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,032
She's very agitated today.
We're trying to quiet her down.

217
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,878
I think it would be too upsetting.

218
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,593
Wouldn't upset me.

219
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,870
No, but it might upset her.

220
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,150
How's your coffee?
Is it hot enough?

221
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,273
It'll do.

222
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,871
In Savannah's poems...

223
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,628
...are you the shrimper or the coach?

224
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,230
The coach.
Luke's the shrimper, or was.

225
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,676
Savannah's last suicide attempt
was right after his death, correct?

226
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,509
Yeah, she had a few bad days over it.

227
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,792
Were there other times?

228
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,033
I don't know.

229
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,438
There might have been another time
when we were young, but I'm not sure.

230
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,875
How are you getting paid?

231
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,115
Why change the subject?

232
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,198
Because I don't like it much.
Is it okay if I smoke?

233
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,719
I'd prefer it if you didn't.

234
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,916
How well do you know
your sister's poetry?

235
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,113
I said I was a coach, Lowenstein,
not an orangutan.

236
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,790
I was also an English teacher.
I know her poetry. She's my twin.

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,753
I know it a hell of a lot better
than you do.

238
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,792
You don't like
psychiatrists, do you?

239
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,958
What good do you people do?
You ask a lot of questions.

240
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,957
I'm sick of this whole damn routine.

241
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,720
I'm sick of my sister's
attraction to razorblades.

242
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,957
And I'm sick of shrinks who can't
do a fucking thing to help her.

243
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,230
I don't know if I can
help her either.

244
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,192
But I do know I'm not
gonna give up trying.

245
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,756
Why not? Maybe she just wants
to die too damn much.

246
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,269
And that's okay?
You sound resigned to losing her.

247
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,199
Hell no, it's not okay with me.

248
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,951
Yeah, but I am resigned.

249
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,309
Then I don't think you can
help me with Savannah.

250
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,954
I'm sorry you had
to come all this way.

251
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,518
What do you want from me?

252
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,872
Information.

253
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,359
You see, I've only been Savannah's
doctor for a few months.

254
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,670
There's so much more
I need to know about her.

255
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,838
I need her childhood stories,
and she can't tell me...

256
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,397
...because she's blocked portions of
her life out. Blotted out.

257
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,749
So I need you to be her memory,
in a sense...

258
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,315
...and fill in the missing details.

259
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,195
I've spent my life trying
to forget those missing details.

260
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,391
- I beg your pardon?
- I...

261
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,354
God, she's a pain in the ass.

262
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,959
What time tomorrow?

263
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,676
I'll meet you at the hospital at noon.

264
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,639
Do you have a headache?

265
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,150
A doozy. You wouldn't have any
morphine handy, would you?

266
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,713
Morphine?

267
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,036
That's a joke, Lowenstein.

268
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,077
Come on, get out of the way, kid.
You're gonna get hurt.

269
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,838
Screw you, man.

270
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,319
You gonna help me with the bags?

271
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,637
You out of your mind?
I ain't helping you with no bags.

272
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,877
Come on, move!
Get out of the way, huh?

273
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,593
Yo, taxi!

274
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,079
Shit! Shit!

275
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,153
Move your ass an inch...

276
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,952
...and you can kiss it goodbye.

277
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,113
Hi, Eddie. Go ahead and shoot,
I've had a rotten day.

278
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,471
Tom! You should have told me
you were coming.

279
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,709
The gun, Eddie, the gun.

280
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,992
I'm sorry. Savannah and I have
been robbed twice this year.

281
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,317
They're leaping from fire escapes.
One landed on my air conditioner.

282
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,511
I greased my windowsills.
That didn't help.

283
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,153
I love New York.

284
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,349
Tell me about it.

285
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,278
- How's Andrew?
- Gone.

286
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,359
Said he needed space, so he found
a younger man with a duplex.

287
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,999
It's his loss, Eddie.

288
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,349
Bless you.

289
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,637
Savannah was an angel.
I practically lived over here.

290
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,156
So you're alone now, huh?

291
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,877
Unless I can tempt you into
crossing the line while you're here.

292
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,116
I got enough troubles, Eddie.

293
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,995
Actually, you look terrible, Tom.
You're not even cute anymore.

294
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,794
If that's your idea of seduction,
no wonder you're alone.

295
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,399
Well, it isn't easy.

296
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,029
Did you know Savannah was seeing
a psychiatrist?

297
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,392
Of course. I recommended her.
She's a friend of mine.

298
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,477
It was a bitch washing it out.

299
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,674
You found her?

300
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,509
We've been giving her 50 mgs
three times a day.

301
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,876
I'd bring it down to 25.

302
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,276
Don't expect too much.

303
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,149
Dr. Lowenstein, I need to see you.

304
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,512
Hey, Savannah. Hey, darling.

305
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,472
It's me. Tom.

306
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,716
I have a cancellation,
so why don't you meet me...

307
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,309
...here at the hospital
in 45 minutes, okay?

308
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,272
I'm on the third floor.

309
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,153
What the hell is going on here?
Why is she strapped down?

310
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,749
Her team felt she had to
be restrained...

311
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,190
Why? She has enough drugs
to anaesthetize a whale!

312
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,153
- Her team decides...
- Quit calling them her team!

313
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,396
Sounds like she's trying out
for the Giants.

314
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,995
What should I call them?

315
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,111
Let's be creative.
Call them assholes.

316
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,350
Let me tell you something
about those assholes.

317
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,989
I'm grateful because they
saved your sister's life.

318
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,235
I don't like...

319
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,319
I don't care.
She's still a threat to herself.

320
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,199
There's no point to this
unless we keep Savannah alive.

321
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,710
And I don't care if it takes drugs
or voodoo or reading tarot cards...

322
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,071
...I want her alive.
Do you understand me?

323
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,870
When I'm not picking straw out
of my teeth, I'm a very smart man.

324
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,038
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to sound condescending.

325
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,996
You're tough, Lowenstein...

326
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,357
...and I'm starving.

327
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,359
Any interest in lunch?

328
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,512
Only if you let me pay.

329
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,637
Oh, I insist.

330
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,314
I wouldn't have objected to
Lutèce or Le Cirque.

331
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,158
Their chili isn't as good.
Thank you.

332
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,759
Thank you.

333
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,433
Tell me something.

334
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,114
Why didn't your father
answer my telegram?

335
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,790
Dad only likes good news.
Besides, the shrimp are running good.

336
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,709
And your mother? Why didn't she come?
She was the one I spoke to.

337
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,514
Priorities. My mother's too busy
hiring a caterer...

338
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,756
...for my stepfather's birthday.

339
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,639
Do you always make jokes
in place of conversation?

340
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,876
It's the Southern way, ma'am.

341
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,398
The "Southern way"?

342
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,113
My mother's immortal phrase:

343
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,029
"When things get too painful,
we either avoid them or we laugh. "

344
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,508
When do you cry,
according to the Southern way?

345
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,633
We don't.

346
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,913
Jesus, even Sally makes
better chili than this.

347
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,953
- I have a good recipe. Interested?
- No, thanks. I never cook.

348
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,833
What the hell is it with you doctors?

349
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,830
Does " Callanwolde"
mean anything to you?

350
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,669
No. Why?

351
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,475
Savannah kept repeating it
when she first came out of the coma.

352
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,757
" Callanwolde, Callanwolde. " No?

353
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,188
I don't know.

354
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,077
I have to get back to the hospital.

355
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,633
It's late.

356
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,753
I can't see you tomorrow
till about 7:30. Okay?

357
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,714
Lowenstein!

358
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,034
What's your first name?

359
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,148
- Why?
- Why not?

360
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,793
It's just that my patients
call me Dr. Lowenstein.

361
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,191
But I'm not your patient.

362
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,993
Susan.

363
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,389
Thank you, doctor. I won't use your
name. I just wanted to know it.

364
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,273
Be on time.

365
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,151
- Eight bucks a pound.
- Eight bucks a pound? For shrimp?

366
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,795
- Are they fresh?
- Yeah!

367
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,195
They're today's. They're gorgeous.

368
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,789
- I'll take a pound.
- Let me at the scale.

369
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,038
<i>Shrimp Newburg? For chrissakes,</i>
<i>Lila, it's got wine in it!</i>

370
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,274
It's garbage!

371
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,718
It's elegant food, Henry. And it's
gonna get me into Colleton League.

372
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,514
That's a joke. Why do you think
they got a Colleton League?

373
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,751
To keep people like you out.
Joop!

374
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,958
Why do you want to join anyway, Mama,
if they don't want you?

375
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,674
Of course they want me.
They just don't know it yet.

376
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,313
Even the dog won't eat it.

377
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,957
Goddamn it! I work hard all day long
to come home and eat this shit?

378
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,149
I think it's good.

379
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,831
- Who asked you?
- Nobody.

380
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,679
Nobody.

381
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,473
Tip your head up, boy.
You ain't gonna cry, are you?

382
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,438
What did I tell you about crying?

383
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,955
What did I tell you about
crying in this house?

384
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,913
Put the hands in your lap.
Sit up straight!

385
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,395
Come on, sit up straight.
You gonna cry now?

386
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,108
Savannah, get this little girl
one of your dresses.

387
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,234
Why are you so mean?

388
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,476
Henry, why don't I get you
another supper?

389
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,474
There's leftover hash and rice.
I'll heat it up.

390
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,629
Give me a hand, Tom.

391
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,593
You go out in the kitchen
with the rest of the girls.

392
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,671
Bully on somebody your own size.

393
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,670
Can't anyone take a joke around here?

394
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,029
<i>I'll help, Mama. </i>

395
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,711
I want you to melt
this butter, Savannah.

396
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,356
Heat up this rice. You chop that
onion into fine little pieces, Tom.

397
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,195
<i>And the Yankees are back out in front. </i>

398
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,469
<i>I'm sorry, Mama. </i>

399
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,790
There's nothing to be sorry for.

400
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,036
Marry into nothing, you get nothing.

401
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,037
Add some pepper, Tom.

402
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,637
Hand me that Worcestershire sauce.

403
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,029
Your mouth is hanging open, child.

404
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,350
Nice and spicy.

405
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,472
All I want is a good,
plain American meal!

406
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,591
Here you go, darling.

407
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,476
Now, this is food, Lila.

408
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,679
Eat up, children.

409
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,310
So your mother fed him dog food, huh?

410
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,080
He even asked for a second helping.

411
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,153
Maybe you got your sense
of humor from your mother.

412
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,509
Very funny.

413
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,955
She called today, very concerned
about Savannah.

414
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,355
Don't believe a word she says.
She's a liar.

415
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,191
That's interesting. She said
you'd tell lies about her.

416
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,719
That figures.

417
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,152
I saw Herbert Woodruff come out of your
office. He sure can play the fiddle.

418
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,759
You're changing the subject.

419
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,314
What's wrong with him?

420
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,279
Just kidding.

421
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,439
I can't believe anybody
with that kind of money has troubles.

422
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,639
- Are you really that provincial?
- Oh, hell, yes. So is Savannah.

423
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,991
When we were kids, the only way
to get off our island was by boat.

424
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,713
We grew up on a tidal plain.

425
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,634
A tidal plain? What does that mean?

426
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,239
Tides mean everything, Lowenstein.
They measure everything.

427
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,591
Moods, seasons,
the time to plant...

428
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,633
...to fish, to mate.

429
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,628
It's primitive. Biological clocks
ticking all over the place.

430
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,355
Sounds like a nice way to live.

431
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,991
What else did she say, my mother?

432
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,110
She said that she was the one who
encouraged Savannah to become a poet.

433
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,435
Is that true?

434
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,958
Jesus Christ!

435
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,878
That woman has no shame.

436
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,957
Wanna know how
she encouraged Savannah?

437
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,072
- By burning her childhood journals.
- Why'd she burn them?

438
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,273
Because Savannah was being disloyal,
writing about our hideous family.

439
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,948
What's hideous about your family?

440
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,833
Are you asking me to be disloyal?

441
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,235
If that's what it takes
to help Savannah, yes.

442
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,111
Aren't we about done?
What time is it?

443
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,517
We still have a few more minutes.

444
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,672
What did Savannah do after your
mother burned her journals?

445
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,996
She took her fingers, and she
wrote in the sand.

446
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,553
And then she wrote in the air.

447
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,069
She wrote poetry so mother
wouldn't understand it.

448
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,635
Your mother helped to create a poet.

449
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,195
Bullshit, Lowenstein.
She created a schizophrenic.

450
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,119
My mother should've raised cobras,
not children.

451
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,310
Can you tell me anything good
about your parents?

452
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,035
No.

453
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,074
Try.

454
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,474
They did two really good things:

455
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,238
Luke and Savannah.

456
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,032
Incredible people.

457
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,313
Passionate, defiant, not for sale.

458
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,315
What about you?

459
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,559
Oh, I was a courteous Southern boy
that did what he was told.

460
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,354
I was responsible and normal and dull.

461
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,431
I don't know what normal is,
and you're anything but dull.

462
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,398
Compared to them, I was.

463
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,791
Your sister's in the hospital,
and your brother's dead.

464
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,716
You must be doing something right.

465
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,751
You can go now.

466
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,039
Time's up.

467
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,589
Good night.

468
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,272
"Women and men
Both little and small

469
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,914
Cared for anyone not at all

470
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,793
They sowed their isn't
They reaped their same

471
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,833
Sun, moon, stars, rain

472
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,998
Children guessed
But only a few

473
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,998
And down they forgot
As up they grew. "

474
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,998
<i>So this began a series</i>
<i>of confessional days... </i>

475
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,192
<i>... when I spun out the history</i>
<i>of Savannah's past... </i>

476
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,879
<i>... in order to keep her alive. </i>

477
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,993
<i>By the second week,</i>
<i>I'd developed the New York willies. </i>

478
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,676
<i>The guilt that every</i>
<i>out-of-towner feels... </i>

479
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,190
<i>... if he's not improving his mind</i>
<i>every goddamn second. </i>

480
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,436
<i>I made a list of things I should do. </i>

481
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,036
<i>Museums, plays, run six miles</i>
<i>in under 50 minutes. </i>

482
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,959
<i>See three foreign films</i>
<i>all at the same time. </i>

483
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,798
<i>Anything not to feel guilty. </i>

484
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,873
<i>Tom, how old was Savannah when you</i>
<i>first realized... </i>

485
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,638
<i>... something was wrong with her?</i>

486
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,637
<i>About seven or eight. </i>

487
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,030
<i>Anything specific happen?</i>

488
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,354
My mother had a baby at home.

489
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,238
It was stillborn.

490
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,957
She told us it died
because we were bad.

491
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,515
Anyway, we were gonna bury it
the next day...

492
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,030
...so Dad wrapped it in some towels
and put it in the freezer.

493
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,110
That night, I got up
to get a drink of water...

494
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,949
...and I saw Savannah sitting
in the rocking chair...

495
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,230
...with the dead baby in her arms.

496
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,230
She was saying...

497
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,831
..."You're the lucky one because you
don't have to live with us. "

498
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,839
Did you say anything to her?

499
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,308
The next day I did, but she didn't
remember anything about it.

500
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,238
When I told her, she said...

501
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,193
..."Why would anyone do a crazy thing
like that?"

502
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,156
So you were her memory even then?

503
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,158
I guess so.

504
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,035
Goddamn locks!

505
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,629
I'm coming! I'm coming!

506
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,752
<i>What was that again?</i>

507
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,396
I'm learning to speak the language
of the natives here. Hi, Sally.

508
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,868
How's it going down there?

509
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,514
It's just sort of blowing up a storm.

510
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,512
I got the girls' drawings.

511
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,194
- Did they get my letters?
<i>- Yes, and they loved them. </i>

512
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,960
Good! Did you get my letter?

513
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,079
Tom?

514
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,158
It's not a good idea for you
to come home this weekend.

515
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,234
Why not?

516
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,509
I'm just not sure that I want
to see you right now.

517
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,631
I have a lot to figure out.

518
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,398
<i>What's the point, Tom?</i>

519
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,517
<i>I mean, let's face it... </i>

520
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,714
<i>... we don't make each other</i>
<i>feel good anymore. </i>

521
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,795
Right.

522
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,108
<i>Look... </i>

523
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,868
...I didn't want to tell you this
on the telephone.

524
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,675
I wanted to tell you before you left.
But the way you left...

525
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,715
...there wasn't any time.

526
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,077
What did you want to tell me, Sally?

527
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,913
What's his name?

528
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,199
What's his name, Sally?
The man must have a name.

529
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,628
Jack Cleveland.

530
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,431
Oh, no. Oh, no!
Oh, Jesus, Sally!

531
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,079
Jack Cleveland?

532
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,034
That aging, pompous hippie from the
hospital who still rides a motorcycle?

533
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,754
Oh, for chrissakes, Sally!
Why him?

534
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,433
<i>Why him?</i>

535
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,113
Because he knows how he
feels about me.

536
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,792
Oh, Sally.

537
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,072
This is too difficult to talk
about over the phone.

538
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,232
Just think about it carefully, okay?

539
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,194
I hardly think about anything else.

540
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,472
Good night, Tom.

541
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,994
What?

542
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,590
Are you really in love?

543
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,638
I'm not sure.

544
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,508
I might even be doing this to hurt you.

545
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,439
I gotta go.

546
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,679
Dear Sally:

547
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,678
<i>I wish the words,</i>
<i>"I love you"... </i>

548
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,791
<i>... weren't so</i>
<i>difficult for me. </i>

549
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,871
<i>I've missed you. </i>
<i>I miss touching you. </i>

550
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,637
<i>I don't know what keeps me</i>
<i>at such a distance. </i>

551
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,349
<i>I'm sorry I disappoint you, Sally... </i>

552
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,194
<i>... but you're right to feel that way. </i>

553
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,392
<i>How else could you react</i>
<i>to half a man?</i>

554
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,988
<i>How could you not be disappointed?</i>

555
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,759
<i>Hell, I seem to disappoint anyone who</i>
<i>tries to find the best in me. </i>

556
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,829
<i>Tom?</i>

557
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,309
Ma'am?

558
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,318
Come on in here.

559
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,639
Come on, lie beside me. Come on.

560
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,312
You're the only Wingo
who's gonna amount to something.

561
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,113
Luke can't do it,
because he isn't smart.

562
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,911
Savannah can't,
because she's just a girl.

563
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,918
- But Luke's smart, Mama.
- Not like you.

564
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,599
Or me.

565
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,831
Nobody knows this yet...

566
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,915
...but I'm an amazing woman.

567
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,352
Do you believe that?

568
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,313
Yes, ma'am.

569
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,313
I'm not gonna die in a house
like this. I promise you that.

570
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,118
Something else, Tom.

571
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,511
I love you
more than I love any of them.

572
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,756
- But, Mama!
- I do.

573
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,837
I can't help it.

574
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,837
You're my favorite.

575
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,393
That's gonna be our little secret.

576
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,278
You keep a secret?

577
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,879
Yes, ma'am.

578
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,877
Can I go now?

579
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,871
Not till you tell me you love me.

580
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,596
I love you, Mama.

581
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,158
It took me 20 years to tell Luke
and Savannah about my secret.

582
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,477
And when I did, they just fell
on the floor, howling.

583
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,075
My mother took each of them
into that room...

584
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,669
...and told them exactly
the same thing.

585
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,031
Why did you tell me that story?

586
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,669
To prove that Lila Wingo would...

587
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,272
Just to show why Savannah
could never trust her.

588
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,831
You mean why you could
never trust her.

589
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,638
I'm sorry. That's the wrong story.
Let's just skip it...

590
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,229
...and I'll try
to think of a better one.

591
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,912
What's bothering you?

592
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,990
Global warming, acid rain,
the national debt...

593
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,478
And my wife's having an affair with
a heart surgeon in South Carolina.

594
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,754
Jesus! I feel like such an idiot.

595
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,671
I never even knew it was going on.

596
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,600
- Maybe you weren't paying attention.
- Bullshit!

597
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,475
Let's face it, Lowenstein.
Women are more devious than men.

598
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,912
You're great at hiding things. You
keep secrets. You smile when you lie.

599
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,634
You expect a man to be
a tower of strength.

600
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,838
When he's got a few weaknesses
and insecurities...

601
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,794
...what do you do? You turn around,
and goddamn it, you betray him!

602
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,517
You feel that your mother
betrayed you?

603
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,399
I was talking about my wife!

604
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,271
Oh, God, I hate this Freudian crap.

605
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,756
It's not your job to listen
to my problems. I'd like to go.

606
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,479
You're free to leave anytime.

607
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,789
Good!

608
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,710
<i>Goddamn shrink. </i>

609
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,797
<i>Who was I kidding?</i>

610
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,276
<i>I was a champion at keeping secrets. </i>

611
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,959
<i>Better than any woman. </i>

612
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,037
<i>Until Susan Lowenstein came along. </i>

613
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,990
<i>A man who never talked... </i>

614
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,760
<i>... now is doing nothing else. </i>

615
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,589
<i>Her questions making me</i>
<i>as dizzy as her perfume. </i>

616
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,313
Excuse me.

617
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,398
Would you like to dance?

618
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,798
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

619
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,159
Come on.

620
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,198
Come on, just loosen up!

621
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,109
Hands to yourself!
He's spoken for.

622
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,996
How's Savannah?
When can I see her?

623
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,953
I don't know, Eddie.
It's like talking to a fern.

624
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,958
I'm glad she's improving.
Come on, let's dance.

625
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,958
Give me a break, Eddie.
I'm a lousy dancer.

626
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,754
Walk on the wild side.
You're in the big city.

627
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,034
Oh, hell. All right...

628
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,394
God, you are a lousy dancer!
Go mingle.

629
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,198
Get in here.
Get into the party.

630
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,789
Where are my chairs?

631
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,753
I found four of them,
and I have a lead on another two.

632
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,951
Roberta, have I got a settee for you!

633
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,029
Don't laugh.

634
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,633
- You're laughing!
- I'm sorry.

635
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,753
I'm surprised to see you here.

636
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,757
Why? I like Eddie.

637
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,713
You know, I...

638
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,794
You really pissed me off today.

639
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,991
But you made me think
about some things.

640
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,668
Don't make it a habit,
or I'll charge you.

641
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,836
Oh, we do have a sense of humor!

642
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,350
I thought you had it
surgically removed.

643
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,758
You look mighty pretty tonight.

644
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,114
Thank you.

645
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,749
Are you all right?

646
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,155
Oh, God, I'm great. I'm just great.

647
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,674
Now that I finished lying,
can I ask you to dance?

648
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,909
No?

649
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,914
You'd be the first woman
I've danced with in New York.

650
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,668
I'd rather not.

651
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,509
Come on, Lowenstein.
Walk on the wild side.

652
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,428
It's a party. Come on.

653
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,360
Don't worry, I can't dance and make a
pass at the same time. I lose count.

654
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,473
You came alone?

655
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,157
Yeah, it's funny. I never went
anywhere alone until I got married.

656
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,237
Well, that speaks well
for matrimony.

657
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,271
No, it's just that...

658
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,911
...my husband travels a lot.

659
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,593
What does he do?

660
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,516
You know, it's late.
I really should go.

661
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,511
- I'll take you home.
- No, it's okay. I'm fine.

662
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,672
I'm a Southerner, ma'am.
We take our ladies home.

663
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,519
How do you do it?

664
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,753
How do you listen to people's sob
stories? Doesn't it depress you?

665
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,520
No, not if I think I can help them.

666
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,436
Anyway, you learn to separate your
patients' problems from your own.

667
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,910
Now yours, I think I could handle.

668
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,031
Oh, yeah? Don't be so sure.

669
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,919
Tell me something.

670
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,073
Did you ever want to write
like Savannah?

671
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,190
You're changing the subject,
Lowenstein.

672
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,389
Am I?

673
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,313
It's a technique
I'm learning from you.

674
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,513
There he is again. You see him?
That guy is following me.

675
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,913
So you're a shrink to the stars, huh?

676
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,350
He's not my patient.
He's my husband.

677
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,152
Really? Herbert-fucking-Woodruff
is your husband?

678
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,920
Herbert Woodruff is my husband, yes.

679
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,519
How'd you meet him?

680
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,159
I saw him perform at...

681
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,079
...Carnegie Hall. I was 22 years old.

682
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,229
I had never heard anything like it.
I mean, that kind of...

683
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,598
...passion, artistry, whatever
you call it. It's like Savannah's.

684
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,189
They have that gift
to make people feel.

685
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,195
I fell in love with him instantly.

686
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,835
So you married him, and then
you lived happily ever after, huh?

687
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,473
I married him.

688
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,712
Are you saying mine isn't
the only screwed up union?

689
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,833
- I'm not telling you anything more.
- Wait. No fair. I spill my guts.

690
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,828
I tell you my marriage is full
of holes. But you got nothing to say?

691
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,235
I think it's your turn
to give a little.

692
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,830
Come on, Lowenstein, be human.
Talk to me.

693
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,877
- Tell me about yourself.
- I can't.

694
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,952
Why are there never any cabs?

695
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,948
I'll ask you a few simple questions,
and you just answer.

696
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,673
- Simple?
- Very simple.

697
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,030
- What's your father's name?
- Douglas.

698
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,878
What's your favorite car?

699
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,754
I like old Ford Woodies.

700
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,633
Good! Who's the first boy
you ever kissed?

701
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,638
Dick Berkowitz. He was very cute.

702
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,276
Do you have any idea how beautiful
you look in that suit?

703
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,270
Is this " Make Lowenstein
Feel Better Day"?

704
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,233
And you got a great smile.
You should smile more.

705
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,510
- Stop.
- You don't believe me, do you?

706
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,876
Come here. Let me show you something.

707
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,877
Come here. Let me show you.

708
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,235
- A painting?
- No, you. Look at you.

709
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,749
You. Your face,
your smile, your suit.

710
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,873
- Great stuff here. Beautiful.
- Okay, you convinced me.

711
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,514
Now, would you please get me a cab?

712
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,879
<i>Come up for a minute. </i>
<i>I'd like you to meet my son. </i>

713
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,274
<i>Sure. Okay. </i>

714
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,999
Come on in.

715
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,639
Bernard?

716
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,072
I'd like you to meet a friend.

717
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,713
How do you do?

718
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,912
- Mind stepping out of the way?
- Oh, excuse me.

719
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,634
Mr. Wingo is
a football coach, Bernard.

720
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,875
Oh, yeah?

721
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,591
Dad called from Vienna today.
Said to say hi to you when I saw you.

722
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,677
Did you practice this afternoon?

723
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,113
No, I've been too busy watching TV.

724
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,958
You're being rude, Bernard.

725
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,310
No, he's being a teenager.

726
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,670
I used to be one myself.

727
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,154
No kidding?

728
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,911
Where are you from?
Your accent's weird.

729
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,951
South Carolina.

730
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,913
- Is this TV or...?
- I'm trying to watch this movie.

731
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,792
All right, it's late. Come on.

732
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,718
It's time for bed, Bernard.
Let's go.

733
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,071
- Turn down the TV and go to bed.
- I'll see you, Bernard.

734
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,793
I'm sorry that he was so rude to you.

735
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,991
You don't have to apologize,
Lowenstein.

736
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,237
Teenagers, by definition,
are not fit for society.

737
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,998
That's true.

738
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,354
Bernard wants to play football.
That's why I brought you to meet him.

739
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,278
I thought that maybe you could
coach him a couple of days a week.

740
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:08,110
You see, he never gets a chance
to play while his father's around.

741
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,878
Herbert's on tour.
I thought maybe...

742
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,354
Is this a job offer?

743
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,195
Yes, and I would insist on paying you.

744
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,635
What would you consider
a reasonable rate?

745
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,792
What are your rates?

746
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,950
I charge $150 an hour.

747
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,798
Fine, I'll take it.

748
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,515
You must be a very good coach.

749
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,358
Forget it, Lowenstein.
I'm not a charity case yet.

750
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,919
Tell Bernard we'll start Monday.

751
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,634
Good. Good night.

752
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,596
First rule of thumb, Bernard.
Never be late.

753
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,392
I didn't want to come anyway, okay?

754
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,279
Your mother thinks you want to play.
Is that true?

755
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,277
Maybe, maybe not.

756
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,188
Where do you coach, Mr. Wingo?
Hillbilly country?

757
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,349
We're a little
class-conscious, are we?

758
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,033
Do you go to Miss Porter's?

759
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,271
Phillips Exeter, smart-ass.

760
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,196
You didn't get to play last year,
did you?

761
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,755
How'd you know?

762
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,109
Because any snot-nosed punk that
would dare call his coach a smart-ass...

763
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,754
...wouldn't get to haul water,
let alone play.

764
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,993
With your attitude, you belong
in the bleachers, kid.

765
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,276
When you want to play football,
get my number from your mother.

766
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,469
Catch.

767
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,992
You need help.

768
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,194
This is not an attractive look
for a middle-aged man.

769
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,234
You can take me shopping. Did you
ever hear of Renata Halpern?

770
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,429
No, who is she?

771
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,990
I don't know, but she writes poems
about growing up Jewish in Brooklyn.

772
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,111
Was she staying
with Savannah recently?

773
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,198
Not that I know of. Of course,
I've been out of town a lot.

774
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,710
- Bloomingdale's on Saturday, big boy.
- Okay.

775
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,313
Coach Wingo?

776
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,116
You know, yesterday, I...

777
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,038
You know, I...

778
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,348
I accept your apology, Bernard.

779
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,114
I didn't play last year,
because I never made the team.

780
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,878
They made fun of me.

781
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,674
If I coach you, I promise
they won't make fun of you.

782
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,393
But you gotta promise something.

783
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,110
You gotta shut up, Bernard.
Your mouth pisses me off.

784
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,118
"Yes, sir" is the way
to address me.

785
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,788
First thing we'll do
is follow certain courtesies.

786
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,878
You'll do whatever I tell you
and do it with enthusiasm.

787
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,469
I'm gonna teach you
to play football well.

788
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,433
- I'll run your ass off every day.
- I have my violin lessons.

789
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,073
- Shut up, Bernard.
- Yes, sir.

790
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,874
After I run you till you drop,
make you lift weights...

791
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,433
...tackle till your arms cramp...

792
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,911
...something will happen to you
that's never happened in your life.

793
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,519
What's that, sir?

794
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,398
You're gonna be happy, kid.

795
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,631
Keep moving. Move them.
Hit it!

796
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,718
Come on! Get up.

797
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,873
Drop that leg. Roll.
Drop this leg. Roll.

798
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,469
That's it. All right,
let's see that smile.

799
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,517
Do it again with a smile.

800
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,751
Cross. Back. Cross.

801
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,315
That's it. Cross them over. Cross!

802
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,715
Bring this shoulder out.
This shoulder.

803
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,871
Keep your eyes on the ball.
Concentrate!

804
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,832
Come on, Bernard.
Get your hands up.

805
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,393
Get it. Look behind!

806
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,790
Turn around and run!

807
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,198
<i>You're the greatest person</i>
<i>in the whole world, Daddy. </i>

808
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,870
What? I don't even get the pleasure
of asking the questions anymore?

809
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,991
- When you coming home, Daddy?
<i>- Soon. </i>

810
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,953
Well, if you miss my birthday,
I'm gonna kill you.

811
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,037
Chandler, how could I miss
your birthday?

812
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,959
I was there the day you pushed
your way into the world.

813
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,559
I want an alligator!

814
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,637
<i>You go down to the marsh</i>
<i>and you get one. </i>

815
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,877
I want a stuffed alligator
to sleep in bed with me.

816
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,356
That's a dangerous habit to get
into, kiddo. Is Mama there?

817
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,588
Daddy wants to talk to you.

818
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,035
<i>Oh, hi, Sal. </i>

819
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,470
I want to come home
for Chandler's birthday.

820
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,835
<i>It would only be... </i>

821
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,514
We'd all be upset if you
didn't come, Tom.

822
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,990
Oh, good. Well, thanks, Sally.

823
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,997
Okay. I'll talk to you. Bye.

824
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,838
All right. Bye-bye.

825
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,273
Hustle. Hustle. Hustle!

826
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,912
- You got a broken cigarette.
- You gonna take it away?

827
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,908
<i>So this became my routine. </i>
<i>Coaching Bernard in the morning... </i>

828
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,432
<i>... and in the afternoon, telling the</i>
<i>Wingo family secrets to his mother. </i>

829
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,593
<i>And looking forward to telling them. </i>
<i>Or looking forward to seeing her. </i>

830
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,270
It's as if Savannah has
some kind of a splinter...

831
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,029
...that she's neglected. It festers.

832
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,674
It festers inside you until you...

833
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,270
...you get it out.
You know what I mean?

834
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:58,313
The stories you're telling me
are helping her remember...

835
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,115
...and I'm very proud
of the work we're doing.

836
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,709
Know what I mean?

837
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,672
Time's up. Out.

838
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,389
Lowenstein.

839
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,870
- Here. Catch.
- My nails!

840
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,674
- Throw me the ball.
- Throw you the ball?

841
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,436
Coach, are you trying to kill yourself?

842
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,355
- I'm not quitting, Bernard. You hear?
- Then I'll smoke.

843
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,034
No, you're not smoking.
You're not smoking.

844
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,275
Then throw them out.

845
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,835
- All right. I will.
- All of them.

846
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,951
All right. All right!

847
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,197
- Congratulations. How do you feel?
- I feel better already.

848
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,832
You know, it's an art form
to hate New York properly.

849
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,996
No, it's not. It's a cliché.

850
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,749
You're not such a dumb kid after all.
Let's go to the bookstore.

851
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,599
It's my daughter's birthday.
She wants an alligator.

852
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,792
There's a crocodile in <i>Peter Pan. </i>
Think she'll buy it?

853
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,558
It's my mom's birthday next week.

854
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,194
I bet you got her exactly nothing.

855
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,834
Come on, we'll see if we can
find her something.

856
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,480
Shit! Shit.

857
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:08,198
Who's Renata Halpern?
What's she to do with my sister?

858
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,628
Sit down and cool off.

859
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,432
You knew about this, didn't you?

860
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,710
It's difficult to conduct a session...

861
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,229
It's not a session!
I'm asking you a question.

862
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,512
You're doing a shitty job
of evading it. Who wrote this?

863
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,709
What's so disturbing?

864
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,115
That's not the issue.
Why didn't you tell me?

865
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,673
It wasn't my place to...

866
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,918
You're a piece of work.

867
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,396
I tell you everything, and you
withhold important information!

868
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,835
- Maybe you're withholding.
- It's not about me!

869
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,268
Why are you so upset?

870
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,278
I don't like being lied to.
I don't like secrets.

871
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,074
I could report you.
Have your license suspended.

872
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,271
Stop acting like a petulant child.

873
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,789
You haven't answered me.
Who wrote this book?

874
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,155
You tell me.

875
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,596
I will. My sister wrote it.
It's all about my goddamn family.

876
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,598
If my mother read it,
she'd rip out Savannah's pancreas.

877
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:55,070
Why? Why would she do that?
What are you hiding?

878
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,319
I don't answer any more questions
till you answer mine.

879
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,198
Then sit down and listen.

880
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,995
That is, if you're not too exhausted
by your temper tantrum.

881
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,233
Shit!

882
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,628
When Savannah came to see me, she
told me her name was Renata Halpern.

883
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,515
- She's even crazier than I thought.
- Shut up, or I won't continue.

884
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,751
She said her father was a furrier and
both parents were Holocaust survivors.

885
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,077
She couldn't fool me about being
Jewish, but what fascinated me...

886
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,510
...was why she was
the child of survivors.

887
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,188
What was, or is
she trying to survive?

888
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,913
- How would I know?
- I think you do.

889
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,391
You're supposed to be answering me.
Why'd she do it?

890
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,716
Writing made her want
to be someone else.

891
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,797
- That was okay with you?
- It wasn't okay.

892
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,310
I said she had to resolve her
problems, or she'd have no chance.

893
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,478
People pay you for this?
To turn them into someone else?

894
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,755
You're not listening!

895
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,916
What do you think I do every day?

896
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,475
- Complaining! Avoiding!
- Fuck you, Lowenstein!

897
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,349
Fuck you, Sigmund Freud and
Renata Halpern. It makes me sick!

898
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:03,919
Your reaction makes me sick!

899
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,430
What do you expect?
What if I'd done this to your son?

900
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,358
It's not the same thing!

901
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,636
I'll make him
a Presbyterian quarterback!

902
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,877
It's quite different.
My son didn't try to kill himself.

903
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,150
Give him time, Lowenstein.
Give him time!

904
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,351
You son of a bitch!

905
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,036
My God, I'll go get you some ice.

906
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,799
I see a malpractice suit coming
out of this, doctor.

907
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,150
I am so embarrassed.

908
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,793
What a day.

909
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,433
I get dropped by a dictionary...

910
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,194
...and I find out my sister's
become a Brooklyn Jew.

911
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,389
Here. Here.

912
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,869
I don't need that.
I'd rather bleed to death.

913
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,832
Just be quiet and take it.

914
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,793
After you've stopped bleeding,
I'll take you to dinner.

915
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,719
No chili today.
This time it's gonna cost you.

916
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,951
This is therapy, huh?

917
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,071
Yeah, pretty bloody, isn't it?

918
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,191
I still can't believe
I did that to you.

919
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,073
Face it.
I bring out the animal in you.

920
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,830
- I owe you an apology.
- I accept.

921
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,076
- That was a terrible thing to say.
- Yes.

922
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,919
I know it. Jesus.
Thank you for accepting.

923
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,553
Would you like to order now?

924
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,557
We would like to order now.

925
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,957
Do you want me to order for you?
I eat here all the time.

926
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,794
How can I trust a woman
who can't even cook?

927
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,679
Just because I can't cook
doesn't mean I can't eat.

928
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,872
Go ahead. I'll do anything
to make you happy tonight.

929
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,032
I think...

930
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,434
...we'll start with the <i>artichaut</i>
<i>garni de champignons au safran. </i>

931
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,710
And <i>pour monsieur... </i>

932
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,516
<i>La mousse de canard</i>
<i>aux baies sauvages. </i>

933
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,675
And then we'll have the <i>soupe de</i>
<i>poisson au crabe. </i> Delicious.

934
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,474
And for our main course,
<i>râble de lapin. </i>

935
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,272
The rabbit is superb.

936
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,279
God, there's nothing sexier than
a beautiful woman...

937
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,391
...ordering food in French.

938
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,193
Read me the whole menu.

939
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,152
- Are you flirting with me?
- Yeah, I think I am.

940
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:07,750
I'd like you to find me attractive,
bloody nose and all.

941
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,877
I'd like to ask you about Savannah.

942
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,836
- Don't you ever take a night off?
- No.

943
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,197
You said you'd do anything to
make me happy. Just one thing.

944
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,637
Savannah told me her children's book
came out of a dream.

945
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,989
More like a nightmare.

946
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,431
Images in it terrorized her,
but she didn't know why.

947
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:28,389
Like the three stray dogs.
What do you think it means?

948
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,952
Lowenstein, you're incorrigible.

949
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,878
We're at a wonderful restaurant...

950
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,753
...and you want me to interpret
my sister's dreams?

951
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,349
You wanna interpret dreams?
Do mine.

952
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,398
I had a great one about you
last night.

953
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,837
You had a dream about me?

954
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,116
- You wanna hear?
- I'm not sure.

955
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,717
Don't worry.
This one's G-rated.

956
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,713
This one?

957
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,668
Tell me.

958
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,596
There was a blinding snowstorm
right here in New York City.

959
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,473
I went out for a walk,
and I ran into you.

960
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,590
We decided to go to the Rainbow Room.

961
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,034
No one was there.

962
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,629
So we started to slow dance.

963
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,752
What do you think it means?

964
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,310
You said it was a snowstorm?

965
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,831
Blinding snowstorm?

966
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,635
Maybe there's something
you're afraid to see.

967
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,116
Maybe I wanna get to know you better.

968
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,116
Maybe you're trying to snow me.

969
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,911
Maybe I have cold feet.

970
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,036
Maybe you just miss winter.

971
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,398
Move those legs. Move them!

972
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,039
That's it. Get in position.

973
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,719
Keep your head up. Come!

974
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,034
Is that my son?

975
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,357
Is that you in there, Bernard?

976
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,711
I don't think this was
such a good idea.

977
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,239
Stop being a Jewish mother.

978
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,590
I am a Jewish mother.
I brought sandwiches.

979
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,358
Oh, good. I'm starving.

980
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,318
I got delicious ones here.

981
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,589
Take a break.

982
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,636
Great. I got one for you.

983
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,479
Slave away in the kitchen all day
making those?

984
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,188
I bought them as usual.
Would you like one?

985
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,399
No, I'm not hungry.

986
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,396
So can I watch you play?

987
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,670
I promise I won't be overprotective.

988
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,877
I don't feel like playing anymore.

989
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,039
Let's toss the ball around
for a few minutes.

990
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,950
Am I a trained seal?
I gotta do what she wants?

991
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,991
Oh, you got it tough, kid!

992
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,034
Let's lie in the grass and cry for all
the terrible misfortune in your life.
