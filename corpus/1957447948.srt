<i>This is a story</i>
<i>about four brothers.</i>

15
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,103
<i>It's a love story, kinda.</i>

16
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,857
<i>It's their quest to get it,</i>
<i>keep it, and maintain it.</i>

17
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,318
<i>You know, that white picket fence thing.</i>

18
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:16,279
<i>Or, in this case, brown bamboo fence?</i>

19
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,614
-Hey. Babe.
-You're so late.

20
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,033
-I'm so sorry.
-That's okay, everybody's waiting.

21
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,285
Okay, thank you. Thank you so much.

22
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,537
-Pop!
-Hello. Hey, you're late.

23
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,914
I know, I know, I know, I know.

24
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,333
There's just been,
I have so much going on.

25
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,252
<i> If you didn't get it</i>
<i>by now, they're Filipino.</i>

26
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,296
<i>Specifically, Filipino-American.</i>

27
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,839
<i>In some ways, it's the same,</i>

28
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,508
<i>and in other ways, very different.</i>

29
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:41,012
<i>Generous by nature, Filipinos adapt</i>
<i>to their surroundings more than most.</i>

30
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,764
<i>I mean… I mean, it makes sense.</i>

31
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,308
<i>They've been occupied by</i>
<i>the Americans, the Japanese…</i>

32
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,729
<i>Heck, the country is named after</i>
<i>King Philip II of Spain.</i>

33
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:50,980
Hey!

34
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,566
<i>It's probably why</i>
<i>we say</i> <i>"bahala na"</i> <i>so much.</i>

35
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,984
<i>Come what may.</i>

36
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,447
<i>Anyway, point being,</i>
<i>Filipinos are a weird mix.</i>

37
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,866
<i>Like, they're Asians,</i>
<i>but, like, the other Asians.</i>

38
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,204
<i>Which is kind of fitting,</i>
<i>since this story takes place in Pittsburg.</i>

39
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,957
<i>The other Pittsburg, without the "H."</i>

40
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,334
<i>Pittsburg, California.</i>

41
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,420
I know, I know, but I'm right on time.

42
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,010
-You have your brothers waiting.
-I know, I know.

43
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:27,141
<i>And this tale begins at</i>
<i>a classic Filipino tradition, a wedding.</i>

44
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,185
All right, here we go.

45
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,104
-Let's go, it's a big day.
-Cheers. Big day.

46
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,607
Ah!

47
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,150
-Whoa.
-Amazing.

48
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,403
<i>Brothers have</i>
<i>a unique relationship.</i>

49
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,655
<i>Longest relationship</i>
<i>most have in their lives.</i>

50
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,283
<i>They know each other</i>
<i>better than anyone else,</i>

51
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,451
<i>but they couldn't be more different.</i>

52
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,039
<i>Look, don't get me wrong.</i>

53
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,709
<i>They're thick as thieves</i>
<i>and they love each other immensely.</i>

54
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,420
<i>But there are unspoken agreements</i>

55
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:59,007
<i>that deprive them from fully developing</i>
<i>that keeps them in their lanes.</i>

56
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,884
<i>The reliable one,</i>

57
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,928
<i>the lucky one,</i>

58
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,555
<i>the funny one,</i>

59
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,307
<i>the dark one.</i>

60
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,475
Hey, Pop.

61
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,477
Good morning, everyone.

62
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,523
You can't speak, fool.

63
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,735
Where are you guys coming from?

64
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,653
-From church.
-It's Friday.

65
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,030
They go to church on Friday now.

66
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,449
But I thought she went to church
on Sundays and Wednesdays.

67
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,952
-Yeah, well, she goes on Fridays now too.
-Man, they be going almost every day.

68
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,620
I think she thinks she's gonna die soon,

69
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,914
and I think she thinks this is
her ticket to get into heaven.

70
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,667
-That's not how it works.
-Oh, I know, I tried to tell her.

71
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,835
Hey, guys.

72
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,212
Somebody has to take Lola
to her dialysis later.

73
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,716
I got her on the way to work,
but somebody's got to pick her up.

74
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,760
-David, pick up grandma.
-What? I um...

75
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,845
You ain't doing shit, so you pick up Lola.

76
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,805
Let me check my schedule.

77
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,474
Pass the Ensenada.

78
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,851
-What'd you say?
-Pass the Ensenada.

79
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,686
What are you talking about, man?
This is called pandesal.

80
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,646
-Same thing.
-Uh, no it ain't.

81
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,190
-They're bread.
-Huh?

82
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,941
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

83
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,234
Okay, okay stop it. Look.

84
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,654
One is bread that's kind of sweet
and has cheese on top.

85
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,240
The other one is regular bread,
all right? You take it,

86
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,535
you open it in half like that,
you put the longganisa inside, see?

87
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,913
Okay, yeah, okay that's cool,
but I want the Ensenada.

88
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:12,872
Pass the Ensenada.

89
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,374
Ensaymada. Ensenada is in Mexico.

90
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,462
-That's what I said.
-No you didn't, fool.

91
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,798
Hey, boys,
I just talked to Tita Flor,

92
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,051
and they're looking for a new president
for the Fil-American Association.

93
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,344
Oh, Ma, work's been crazy.

94
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,596
Yeah, Ma,
the kids are doing a lot of sports.

95
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,306
Hey, Ma, David would be good.

96
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,309
-You think I could win?
-David? No, no, no, David.

97
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,312
This is our community.

98
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:38,606
You practically grew up there
singing and dancing.

99
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,151
A representative from our family
would be good as a way to give back.

100
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,238
As it is, you guys don't even Tagalog.

101
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,241
I know, it's partly our fault.

102
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,952
It's not our fault.
They didn't wanna learn.

103
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,580
You know, I just
don't want you guys to lose touch. Okay?

104
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,751
Hey, you will have to order the lechon.

105
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,047
Hey, Mom and Dad
can't afford to pay for all this.

106
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,173
It's gonna be expensive.

107
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,300
You know, I ain't got much, man,
but I'm gonna be there.

108
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,302
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I'm gonna help out and whatnot.

109
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,930
Hey, look, it's not that big a deal.
It's just a little party.

110
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,933
-It's a wedding, people have to eat.
-Oh, and drink.

111
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,935
-How many people we talking?
-God, who knows?

112
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,438
-I don't know who mom invited.
-Um, everyone.

113
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,731
-For sure.
-Whoa, whoa, wait, so then that's like…

114
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,443
-Uncle Jake, Uncle Dom, Uncle Boy.
-And their wives.

115
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,527
And kids.

116
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,029
Then you got Auntie Dulce,
Auntie Pinky, Auntie Barbara.

117
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,698
-And their husbands.
-And kids.

118
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,116
That's Dad's side. Mom's side?

119
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,578
Oh, then you got Auntie Bernie,
Auntie Nita, Auntie Elsie, and Uncle Chet.

120
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,620
And?

121
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,622
And their husbands
and wives and kids, yeah.

122
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,833
Well then, damn, that's,
like, over 100 people already.

123
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,252
And don't forget about
her friends and family.

124
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,837
Fuck, that's a lot of people.

125
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,338
David, you gonna bring someone?

126
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,007
You better not be bringing any hoes.

127
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,425
Guess not.

128
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,427
Okay, so we're going to need
a lot of food.

129
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,887
We're going to need two lechons.

130
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,016
-Yo, let's just make this a potluck.
-It's a wedding.

131
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,018
We can't have people just
bringing their own stuff.

132
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,228
You don't know what the hell
they're gonna bring.

133
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,940
You know what? I got the food.

134
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,777
-What?
-No, no, no, no, we're all gonna chip in.

135
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,904
Right? Right?

136
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:08,905
Huh?

137
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,324
No, no, no, bro. I said I'ma
take care of it I'll take, I got you.

138
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,409
No, I mean, it's gonna be expensive.
I can help pay up for the food.

139
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,329
- That's over 100 people.
- It's gonna be a lot of money...

140
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,414
No, look, I said I was gonna
take care of the food.

141
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,249
I'ma take care of it, all right? Period.

142
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,834
That's it, I'ma do it.

143
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,672
I mean, that's hella food, man.

144
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,050
Dammit, David, I said I'ma
take care of the food, okay?

145
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,511
<i>Filipinos call</i>
<i>the eldest brother "kuya."</i>

146
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,388
<i>This is Dayo. You know,</i>
<i>like the Harry Belafonte song.</i>

147
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,057
<i>Filipinos have nicknames.</i>

148
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,350
<i>His real name is Darius,</i>

149
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,727
<i>although a White guy at work</i>
<i>calls him Dale,</i>

150
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,229
<i>like Chip and Dale.</i>

151
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,147
<i>Dayo has always wanted to be the protector</i>

152
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,524
<i>and in many ways he is,</i>

153
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,025
<i>but the struggle is real,</i>

154
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,153
<i>and his wife, Emily,</i>
<i>isn't always the softest woman.</i>

155
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,239
Dayo, what the fuck?

156
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,406
Why would you say that?

157
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,950
We can't afford that.

158
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,035
-I know.
-Why would you volunteer us to pay?

159
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,828
I didn't agree to that.

160
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,914
Duke said he would help. He has the money.

161
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:03,960
He doesn't have any kids or a mortgage
or mouths to feed on a daily basis.

162
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,127
I know, I know, all right?

163
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,588
But Duke doesn't have to pay
for everything all the time.

164
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,591
Pay for everything?
He doesn't pay for shit.

165
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,927
I just need to do this myself.

166
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,054
But it's not just yourself, Dayo.

167
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,931
It's me and the kids too.

168
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,975
Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know.

169
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,143
I just have to pay for this, babe.

170
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,395
No, you don't.

171
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,522
I have to. I owe him.

172
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:25,898
Who?

173
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,402
All of 'em. But Danny boy definitely.

174
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,820
Why?

175
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,698
Look, not that
I am complaining about this,

176
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:37,660
but we are already letting him stay
in the kid's playroom.

177
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,578
I know.

178
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,539
-For two years.
-Goddammit, I know, okay?

179
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,000
I'll talk to him, I'll talk to him.

180
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,253
But we're not like you. We're not Chinese.

181
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,880
We're Asian too, yeah,
but we're jungle Asian.

182
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,550
-You know what I'm saying?
-No. What are you saying?

183
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,969
We're tribal. We live together.

184
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,680
You know, growing up
we never lived in the house by ourselves,

185
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,723
just parents and kids.

186
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,517
-We always lived with my grandparents.
-Yeah, we still do.

187
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,020
I mean, you know, at one time, I think
we had like 21 people in the house.

188
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,855
Three bedroom house, one bathroom.

189
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,565
While you're taking a shower,
someone's taking a shit.

190
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,275
And what is your point, Dayo?

191
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,235
Jungle Asians!

192
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,362
But you know what?

193
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,865
It was always a blast, it was.

194
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,283
We always had a good time.

195
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,827
You know, everyone was singing
and dancing all the time...

196
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,246
-Yelling at each other all the time.
-Yeah, we're loud.

197
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,625
But you know what? My mom and dad,
they never turned anyone away,

198
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,710
but they just made sure
everyone was happy.

199
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,462
I'm not talking about happiness.

200
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,048
-That's not what this is about.
-I know, but I'm just saying.

201
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,467
I'm just saying it's a tribal thing, babe.

202
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,013
I'm the oldest, my dad's getting older,
and who am I to disrupt tradition?

203
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,059
I don't want you to worry about it,
but I have to do this.

204
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,231
Remember when we first met,

205
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,778
and you said that you'd always
come through no matter what?

206
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,114
That we'd never go without or hungry.

207
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,199
Yeah.

208
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,285
Go all in for us, babe.

209
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,793
I'll get you the cookie jar money.

210
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,547
Tell Fatso I said hi.

211
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,804

coming around here, man.

257
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,108
You ain't from here.

258
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,110
We ain't got no food for you, man.
This ain't McDonald's.

259
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,113
-Hey man, I'm just looking for my boy.
-Your boy ain't here.

260
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,699
- Dayo.
- Berto.

261
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,537
Hey, man, let him through.
Get to work, fools.

262
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,871
- Yeah.
- My bad, my bad.

263
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,541
Get to work, all right? Damn.

Yo, man.

266
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,633
You hugged me too long,
gave that <i>bakla </i>slow dance.

267
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,303

00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,347
-What's up, man? How you been?
-Good, man.

00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,895
So what's good with you, man,
how's the brothers?

Oh yeah, you know, I mean the wedding.

273

The wedding?

274
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,943
Let me go, man, let me go.

275
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:21,861
I got an outfit too.

276
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,363
You know the one from
<i>Chess King,</i> that blazer.

277
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,115
Let me come through.

278
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,659
Yeah, yeah, of course, man.

279
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,786
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, of course. You're my boy.

280
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,997
I know, man, it's not the same
'cause, you know,

281
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,165
the shit went down with your sister, man.

282
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,043
Man, I told you it was a bad idea
to date my sister.

283
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,546
Man, I got mad love for her
but she, ah…

284
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:42,840
No, I know man, I feel bad, man.

285
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:46,051
I didn't want to mess with her, man,
but she smells so good.

286
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,137
Like, tortillas and cool water...

287
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,724
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Take care of that, man! Don't drop that.

288
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,518
Keep loading.
I want all that outta here, man.

289
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:58,439
Sell all them TVs, and do not come back
unless you sell everything.

290
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,817
I want cashola. I don't care if you sell
it to Manny Pacquiao's auntie,

291
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,360
the cousin, Johnson Enriques.

292
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,820
I want all of it sold.

293
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:10,117
Anyways, man,
I got a job for you, that's right.

you'd be doing me a big favor.

295
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,122
Thank you,
I really appreciate this. Thanks.

296
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,374

-There's some instructions in there.
-Wait, what instructions?

315
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,465
Yeah, there's instructions there.

Yo, you got to pick up grams

No, no, no, no, no,

<i>No, you said I was picking her up.</i>

343
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,225
You know, my car is
hella fucked up right now.

344
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,726
Gotta take that shit to the shop.

00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,363
Fucker, I'm in the middle

349
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,703
Hello? Yo, are you getting high right now?

350
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,580
<i>Well, what'd you want me to do, man?</i>

351
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,749
I had to walk all the way to the Marina.

352
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,043
I ain't got no car man, I'm stuck.

Lola, stay in the car.

355
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,834
Berto sent me.

356
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:40,554
Well, well, well. Look who arrived
with a cock in hand.

357
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,680
You Nicky?

358
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,724
That's me.

359
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,728
Berto called. Told me the cock whisperer
on the way. You him?

360
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,063
Yeah, you know, that's me.

361
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,984
Good, good.

362
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,236
Well, good, you know, um.

363
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,822
I'm gonna need somewhere to
get them ready, you know?

364
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,532
Okay, that's right.

365
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,035
We're gonna make a lot of money
tonight, motherfucker.

366
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,413
-Well, that's why I'm here.
-Yeah, that package right there.

367
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,790
You have the special delivery, huh?

368
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,543
-Oh yeah?
-That's right, motherfucker.

369
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,504
This cock right here
come all the way from the Filipino.

370
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,883
When all those motherfuckers see me,
they're gonna be so surprised.

371
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,386
We got a lot riding on
this motherfucker, yeah?

372
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,723
Yeah, I got you.

373
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,184
Yes, you do, cock whisperer.

374
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:32,105
Oh, I don't want to be the hypocrite

375
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,900
but just one thing, okay?

376
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,443
Okay.

377
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,862
I hate dogfighting.

378
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,698
I hate... I hate it.

379
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,952
Every time I see the puppy, I say,

380
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:48,538
"Who the fuck do the animal
abuse like this, huh?"

381
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,665
Not me.

382
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,252
I just love chicken, and I kill them
because I get hungry,

383
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,211
but the dog?

384
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,797
Who the fuck eat the dog? Not me.

385
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,965
You eat the dog?

386
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,426
What the fuck you waiting for?

387
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,805
-Go over there, he has to go right now.
-All right.

388
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,390
You up next, man.

"When alone, inject five minutes

399
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,479

Okay, I come back in a few minute.

Okay, okay.

Yeah, one more minute.

408

00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:11,431
Come, come, come inside.
Come, come, hurry.

This is not a good place.

412
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,435
I said wait in the car.

413
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,563

-Yeah, I know.

474
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:08,043
and we could have extended,
but... this crazy wedding.

475
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,587
Speaking of which, my mom's been
trying to call you about…

476
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,922
-There's a dinner tomorrow.
-Yeah, I gotta call her.

477
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,967
I can't make it tomorrow. I have that
appointment with the specialist.

478
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,428
I'll never make it
from Vallejo to Pittsburg.

479
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:21,222
But I got you something.

480
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,515
What?

481
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,392
Just a little something for your trip.

482
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,186
Babe, what did you get me?

483
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,187
Open it.

484
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,943
Oh, wow.

485
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,363
-Do you like 'em?
-I love 'em, this is amazing.

486
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,449
Oh, thank you.

487
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,201
You're welcome.

488
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:45,538
Listen, try to maybe move
those things around tomorrow?

489
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,041
Because the girls,
they wanna talk about wedding stuff...

490
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,918
-I know, okay I will call them.
-Okay.

491
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,129
And listen, I know that it's crazy,

492
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:57,175
but I think that this could be good
for him, and for her too.

493
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,052
He seems different, stronger.

494
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,137
Like he's got a purpose now.

495
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,348
And I think it's kinda romantic.

496
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,600
You remember romance, right?

497
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,978
-I'm Mr. Romance.
-Mr. Romance?

498
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,398
-How do you think I got you?
-Okay, Mr. Romance?

499
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:14,401
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

500
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,989
-I gotta go.
-I know.

501
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,366
-I gotta go.
-All right, go.

502
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,867
It's getting... I'm running late.

503
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:23,952
-Go.
-Bye.

504
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,161

Cheers.

522
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,186
Hey, listen, so rumor has it,
there's this island.

523
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,689
Okay, it's untouched by corporations
and tourists and all that.

524
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,026
They say it's like a, like a fantasy land.

525
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,111
Like a Never-Never Land.

526
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,739
-It's kind of like the movie <i>The Beach...</i>
-Congratulations.

527
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,158
For real.

528
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:48,119
-And?
-And let's get into some shit.

529
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,454
What kind of shit?

530
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:55,293
Folklore has it that it's the home
of a secret, orgy sex cult.

531
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,461
What the fuck?

532
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:59,255
Yes, it's, that's
what the fuck I'm talking about.

533
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,590
I know you.

534
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:04,093
I mean, we've been working our asses off.
It's time to unwind, baby.

535
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,220
Slow down, DiCaprio.

536
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,640
No, no, no, no, no, you need this.
Shit, I need this.

537
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,309
Look, there's a lot of things I need.
That is not one of them.

538
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:15,104
Mm, I'm telling you,
these babes are fine, man.

539
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,773
Hold on, I gotta check something out.

540
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,650
No, no, no, no.

541
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,029
Oh, whew, that's hot.

542
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,990
All right, I'm just gonna
hit a cockfight, then.

543
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,952

561
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,625
- All right.
- Thank you.

562
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,626
Excuse me.

563
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,005
Duke?

564
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,506
I thought that was you.

565
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,593
Gosh, I mean, this is, this is crazy.

566
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:12,180
How long has it been? Like, 15 years?

567
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,974
Ms. Hernadez?

568
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,897
Okay, follow me.

569
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,898
Hungry?

570
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:25,777
Well, I'm supposed to have dinner
with some coworkers, but yeah.

571
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,320
-Yes.
-Yes?

572
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,994
So, what brings you to Manila?

573
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,204
I'm just here on business.

574
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,332
Um, can you believe this is
my first time in the Philippines?

575
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,292
Well, what about you?

576
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,586
-Why are you here?
-What do you mean?

577
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,296
I live here.

578
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,507
This whole time? Since senior year?

579
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,302
I mean, Dad got a job
and my mom wanted to move back, so.

580
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,553
I was devastated.

581
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,186
Um, I'm married.

582
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:03,231
Oh, yeah, no, me too, me too.

583
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,732
You're a family man now?

584
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,944
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
My wife is barren.

585
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,196
Sorry, what?

586
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:14,242
I mean, no I, we tried having kids
several times, actually.

587
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,868
Just, no.

588
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,370
You?

589
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,748
I have a son, and he's my world.

590
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,005
I looked for you over the years.

591
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,299
Not that I'm looking for you.

592
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,301
I just…

593
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,512
Did you get into Law?

594
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,140
I know how, it was always
important for you,

595
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,058
like, justice for the people.

596
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,893
Yeah, well I did.

597
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:44,313
I went to UP,
passed the bar and everything.

598
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,314
Wow.

599
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,775
And then as soon as I was
about to start at the firm,

600
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,862
I got pregnant, so.

601
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,656
Oh, I'm sorry you had to give that up.

602
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,159
I mean, I know how important
that was to you.

603
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,619
Well, I didn't give anything up.

604
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,289
I mean, I chose my son, so.

605
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,709
Forgot how strong you are.

606
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,970
How's the fam?

607
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,931
Oh, great, just there's more of us now.

608
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,975
You know, loud and crazy.

609
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,311
Just nieces and nephews running around.

610
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,688
My parents are good.

611
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,608
They think I'm disconnected.

612
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,650
How so?

613
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,862
I don't know. Too American?

614
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,239
Lost touch with being Filipino?

615
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,076
You came to the right place
to get in touch.

616
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,453
- Right.
- For sure.

617
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,246
-Um, let's eat.
-Start?

618
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,664
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

619
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,630
Do you need help with that?

620
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,547
Yeah.

621
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,133
Right.

622
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,678

Hernandez.

630
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,116
Yep, Anna Cara Hernandez, right.

631
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,992
Doesn't have the same ring to it,
but yeah.

632
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,661
Yeah.

633
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,414
Halfway around the world, huh?

634
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,668
What are the chances of us
bumping into each other?

635
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,504
I don't believe in coincidences.

636
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,463
That's right.

637
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:35,091
You always used to say, for everything…

638
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,092
A reason.

639
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,805
I don't know.
I figured we'd see each other again.

640
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:52,233
You know, whenever I would think of you,

641
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,945
I'd always see you in that red convertible
with the white roof.

642
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,197
The Rabbit, yeah.

643
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,282
-Yes.
-Yeah, yeah.

644
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,492
The Rabbit. That Rabbit.

645
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,911
You rolling around, just classic Anna.

646
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,164
Top down, hair blowing, blasting The Cure.

647
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:10,251
Oh, I miss that Rabbit. My first car.

648
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,379
And you?

649
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,672
And me what?

650
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,425
-You almost killed my car.
-I didn't almost kill your car.

651
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,928
Yeah, when we went through the city,
and I was teaching you how to drive stick.

652
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,931
Yes. Yes!

653
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,851
Yes, and at the top of every hill,
you were just peeing in your pants

654
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,145
and praying, "Please,
don't let the light be red."

655
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,772
-No. That's your bad.
-"Please, don't let the light be red."

656
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,775
Taking me to San Francisco,
driving on those steep-ass one-ways?

657
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,613
Uh, you remember why we were there, right?

658
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,034
Because you said
if I could drive those streets,

659
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,410
I could drive anywhere.

660
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:48,080
Uh, yeah, and you could not miss that

661
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:50,666
Hyro and De La Soul show at the Fillmore.

662
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,168
-Yes.
-Yes.

663
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,504
That's right, that show was incredible.

664
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,885
You, my little fish,
at a hip hop concert.

665
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:08,142
We were so young and free.
It felt like anything was possible.

666
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,773
No one here knows me like that.

667
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,483
What?

668
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:19,820
I mean, nobody here knows me like that.

669
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,992
It's beautiful here.

670
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,955
I mean, everything's so new,
at least to me.

671
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,501
People and scents in the air,

672
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,795
the air itself, the way it touches you.

673
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,090
But then again, it's not.

674
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,133
It's like something I've always known.

675
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,010
It's like coming home.

676
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,847
Well, welcome home, Duke Abasta.

677
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,516
Come on.

678
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,774
Hey, we should check out this church.

679
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,777
Church? I haven't been at a church
in like ten years.

680
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,487
I'll probably burst into flames.

681
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,907
What? No, come on,
it's beautiful inside.

682
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,993
And if you wanna get to know
the Philippines,

683
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:10,204
there's nothing more Filipino
than a church.

684
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,125
It's a funeral.

685
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,086
What are we doing?

686
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,817
What's going on?

687
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,445
I'm not sure.

688
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,841
What's he saying?

689
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,887
The girl on the left is his wife.

690
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,516
And the one on the right, his true love.

691
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:17,521
The man who died was
a good friend of mine all my life.

692
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:22,401
Actually, he was more like
a brother than a friend.

693
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:27,156
You may think he's
some kind of ladies' man,

694
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:32,453
but I'd like to think of him as someone
who just had too much love in his heart

695
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,039
to share it with just one woman.

696
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,666
He loved his wife and his family fiercely

697
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,169
and they loved him too.

698
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:43,923
The wife never really did anything wrong.

699
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:47,510
And yet he still loved another as well.

700
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:52,306
You see, she is his childhood sweetheart.

701
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,811
Though they never really got together
until later in life.

702
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,815
As they say, unrequited love never dies.

703
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,403
You know the problem
with loving two women?

704
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,741
You can never be there fully for either.

705
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:14,495
Yep, I'm just an old man.

706
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,164
But if I could give you advice?

707
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,961
Don't ever cheat on each other.

708
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:26,006
If ever you fall in love
for another, end it.

709
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,594
And then you can go to the next
and love her all you've got.

710
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,681
But as I see it,

711
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,518
I won't have to worry about you two.

712
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:43,732
You know if my friend
only looked at his wife

713
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,485
the same way you look at each other…

714
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,449
…he would have never had an affair

715
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,409
with my sister.

716
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,042
Excuse me.

717
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,299
<i>♪ I'm crazy about you ♪</i>

718
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:13,053
<i>♪ I'm crazy about you, my baby ♪</i>

719
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,431
<i>♪ I'm crazy about you… ♪</i>

720
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:19,268
Well, here you are.

721
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,020
Yeah, here we are.

722
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,689
Wanna come up for a nightcap?

723
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,067
-No, no, no, no, no, no.
-No.

724
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,320
-No, I know because, I mean-
-No, I know because,

725
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:31,739
-I mean you should know that...
-We both feel something.

726
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,200
No, shh, don't say it.

727
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,619
Don't even say it,
'cause if you say it, it makes it real,

728
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,747
and I can't, you can't, we can't,
this isn't real, right?

729
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,541
This is just some alternate universe
in the Philippines

730
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,711
where high school sweethearts can
reconnect and live happily ever after

731
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,379
like an episode of <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

732
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:51,383
I was going to say that you
should know that adultery is illegal here.

733
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,094
And there's that too.

734
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,431
For everything a reason.

735
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,686
Look, I should go.

736
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,982
Yeah, I'll just… Just gonna
take myself to room 235

737
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,609
and put myself to sleep now.

738
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,403
You always had
a way to make me laugh.

739
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,280
Okay.

740
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,925
Oh, Anna.

741
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,474
No, thank you.

742
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,643
No.

743
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:46,313
What? Who is it?

744
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:08,168
<i>♪ Just start it slow, it's a marathon ♪</i>

745
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:12,423
<i>♪ Get some pain, get a plan</i>
<i>Get some medical ♪</i>

746
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:16,218

00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:20,848

754
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,015
Anna Cara Lopez.

755
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,225
Hernandez.

756
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,354
Abasta.

757
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,573
You gave away your name a while back.

758
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,745
Oh God, are we bad people?

759
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,039
This is crazy.

760
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,251
This is beautiful.

761
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,382
I didn't expect any of this to happen.

762
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:40,386
It felt right, right?

763
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,013
Right, right.

764
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,895
It's like,

765
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:55,442
Like something new but familiar.

766
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,196
Like opening a box of old photos

767
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,657
and just reliving those memories.

768
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:08,288
Although it's not reliving it
because we're living it.

769
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,541
Am I making sense, I mean it's,

770
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:11,458
it's living.

771
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,793
-Living, it's living.
-Yeah.

772
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,211
It's living.

773
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,841
My little fish.

774
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,804
It's so funny how I used to call you that.

775
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:29,560
You know salmon,
they swim from all over the world,

776
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:32,312
just oceans away
to just wind up in the very rivers

777
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,522
in where they were born.

778
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,983
These salmon, they go through

779
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:40,821
a labyrinth of raging rapids
and waterfalls.

780
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,365
They just take a leap of faith.

781
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,827
Sometimes they just jump into
the ravenous jaws or bears…

782
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:51,665
…or they're just casually
swimming in calm waters

783
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:55,252
and then all of a sudden
an eagle swoops down

784
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,629
and snatches 'em up,

785
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:01,592
just digging in their razor-sharp claws
into their flesh.

786
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,303
These salmon, they risk everything
just to spawn

787
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,638
in the very spot in which they were born.

788
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,350
I'm leaving my wife.

789
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:15,063
You're what?

790
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:18,484
Yeah, yeah, I'm leaving my wife.

791
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,319
Duke, that's not what I meant.

792
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,529
No, no, you're right.

793
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,407
You said it,
we're living, baby, this is it.

794
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,077
You're, you're crazy.

795
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,038
And this is right, this feels so right.

796
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:34,208
This is like the most right
I've ever felt.

797
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:38,170
I mean, I came home back to my home
when I touched you, I saw you.

798
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,509
It's like my whole world
came back into focus.

799
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,515
-We can't do this.
-Yes, we can. Yes, we can.

800
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,974
Wait, what are you doing?

801
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,101
What are you... What are you doing?

802
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,102
-No.
-Duke, stop it.

803
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,562
No, no, yes, we can.

804
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,022
No, no, hold on. Hold on.

805
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,190
Shit.

806
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,525
-Hang up.
-No, it's ringing.

807
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,026
-Hang up. You're not...
-Should I?

808
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,819
-Yeah, you're not... Hang up.
-Should we?

809
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,322
<i>This is Sammy. Couldn't get to the phone.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

810
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:08,742
Hello, it's me. Yes, call me back.

811
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,786
I need to talk to you as soon as…

812
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:13,830
I have very important information
to tell you.

813
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,040
Thank you, bye.

814
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,015
You're unbelievable, Duke Abasta.

815
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,434
I made the call.

816
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,853
Yeah, I know. I know, I know you did.

817
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,773
I mean, are you sure you wanna do this?

818
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:42,985
Where are you?

819
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,450
I'm here.

820
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,577
You're here?

821
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:54,955
You're here?

822
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,542
Yeah.

823
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,002
You're really here?

824
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:01,920
Yeah.

825
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,338
You're really here?

826
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,886
You're gonna stay?

827
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,889
How could I not?

828
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,238
I got to go.

829
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,281
What?

830
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,286
I need to go across town
and tell my husband I'm leaving him.

831
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,705
Oh, okay, yeah, no, yeah, right.

832
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,832
You, um, right, of course. Uh…

833
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,170
Now what are we supposed to do?

834
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,053
Figure it out tonight.

835
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,015

909
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,135
Let's go.

910
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,399
<i> The second oldest son</i>
<i>is Danton,</i>

911
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,568
<i>but he's always been called Danny boy.</i>

912
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,820
<i>He's hard-headed.</i>

913
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,280
<i>On top of that, he's brokenhearted.</i>

914
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:54,077
<i>And for hardheaded folks,</i>
<i>broken hearts are hard to mend.</i>

915
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,500
Doesn't he have any headphones?

916
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,001
I've seen the headphones.

917
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,671
Well, if we hear the music,
at least we know he's alive, right?

918
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,172
David, shut up.

919
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,507
I'm just saying.

920
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,009
- Guys I got to go, you got Lola?
- I got her.

921
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,554
It's been like two years. How long does it
take you to get over something like that?

922
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:14,472
Apparently, at least two years.

923
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,058
It's true. I mean,
she did leave him for another guy.

924
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,144
Yeah, but they were
kind of broken up already.

925
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,146
-Yeah, but the kid.
-The kid.

926
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,273
I know. Leaves town,
can't even be in his life?

927
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,482
-Fucked up.
-Fucked up.

928
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,944
Okay, okay, geez, I know all this,

929
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,737
but why do you have to agree
to all of that?

930
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,573
I don't know, she left him for your boy.

931
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,907
Shut up.

932
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:34,993
I think they're, like, in Michigan.

933
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,496
I don't know what to do, man.

934
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,664
You know?

935
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,876
Try to leave him alone in his room
where he doesn't bother anyone.

936
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,878
But then, you know, he goes over there.

937
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,338
Nobody sees him for days,
and he's making music.

938
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,841
Music, by the way, nobody understands.

939
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,759
It's called electronic music.

940
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:54,512
Yeah, well, it sounds like
he's talking to the aliens.

941
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,848
I know. Can we just...
We have to find something.

942
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,349
Maybe snap him out of it.

943
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,517
I feel you.

944
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,977
I think he's broken.

945
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,480
I think he just has PTSD.

946
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:08,067
What? Seriously, you know
mental health is a big-ass issue.

947
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,028
-Come on, David.
-It's trauma.

948
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,530
-David.
-He's traumatized.

949
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,491
Hey, you know what? He did it to himself.

950
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,700
Sometimes things happen.

951
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,577
Yeah, but he "happened" it.

952
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,249
-I invited him to Burning Man.
-David, I swear.

953
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,376
-What?
-Dumbass.

954
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,754
He might be able to find himself
on the Playa.

955
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,923
I just don't know what to do
to help him anymore.

956
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,843
Kids, come eat some quesadillas
before you got to Kajukenbo.

957
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,722
-Uncle Willy still teaching?
-Yeah, he's still teaching.

958
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,390
He taught you. He taught me.

959
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,648
Hey, bro, can you turn it down
just a little bit?

960
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,400
Hey, you good?

961
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,820
Are you hungry?

962
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,493
Hey, man, I lost my phone.

963
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,537
Can I borrow your phone to call my phone?

964
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,746
Fell out of my pocket.

965
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,500
Thanks, bro.

966
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:23,434
What are you doing?

967
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:24,769
What are you doing?

968
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:27,981
This.

969
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:31,317
Hey, man, you are just listening
to the same thing over and over again.

970
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,654
Uh-huh. That's what I'm doing.

971
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:36,990
Okay, cool.

972
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,285
How's it going?

973
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,620
Ah…

974
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,330
You know I dig this shit, right?

975
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,291
This is my kind of music, man.

976
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:50,086
I can take some acid, I'll be out
on the Playa. You know what I mean?

977
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:54,048
All night long, but you, bro, you just…

978
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,176
You are just in here.

979
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,138
See, see here? Here, here, here, here.

980
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:02,015
I'm just… If I could…

981
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,933
See, there's all these things.

982
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,060
All these things that I can…

983
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:12,358
beat and time signature
to fit with the n...

984
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,944
If I can make it all sound…

985
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,488
If I could make it sound
the way it's supposed to sound,

986
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:21,242
the way that it's meant to sound,
then maybe I got a shot

987
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:25,622
about understanding these things,
these, man, I don't, I don't know.

988
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,499
You are just going deeper and deeper
into the abyss, man.

989
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,586
Yes. Yeah, yeah 'cause…

990
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:35,214
'Cause t-that's where the answers
might be, you know?

991
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,009
Look,
don't take it from me, okay?

992
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,553
I mean, I ain't in here reading Nietzsche

993
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,640
or playing with these computers,
or, I don't know, meditating

994
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,183
or whatever the fuck you do in here.

995
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,310
But I gotta tell you something, bro.

996
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,812
The answers ain't in here.

997
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:53,566
I got you.
I don't expect you to understand.

998
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,068
It's cool, man.

999
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,653
Fuck off, bro.

1000
01:00:56,736 --> 01:01:01,074
Look, I do understand.
But I just don't take shit so seriously.

1001
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:03,159
You know what I'm saying?

1002
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:07,246
I mean 'cause I looked for answers
too, and I find it or I don't.

1003
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,123
You think I go to Burning Man

1004
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,834
just to be, like, partying all night
and take hella drugs,

1005
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,003
but I'm finding myself, man.

1006
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,590
I'm finding myself.

1007
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,926
I'm out there, man.
I'm out there doing shit.

1008
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,386
Seeing shit.

1009
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:25,098
Fucking shit up for sure sometimes,
but I am living.

1010
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,308
I know, I lost... I lost that.

1011
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:30,395
I-I don't have that. I…

1012
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,522
I'm not like you guys.

1013
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:35,149
Okay? I'm not... I don't have your heart

1014
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,903
or Dayo's strength or Duke's…

1015
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,073
What does that guy have again?

1016
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,992
Money.

1017
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:48,246
Shit just works out
for that fucking guy, man.

1018
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,081
I lost my heart.

1019
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,584
What do you mean,
you don't have a heart, bro?

1020
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,421
You have the heart of a beast, man.

1021
01:01:57,088 --> 01:02:00,466
Okay, you lost it. So fucking what, man?

1022
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,844
Go out there and get it back.

1023
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:04,637
Go assume the position

1024
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,640
or howl at the moon if you have to.

1025
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,894
Come on, man, do something.

1026
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,813
You gotta get out of this room and just...

1027
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,690
You know what? Say yes.

1028
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:17,483
Yes changes everything.

1029
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,820
It opens up possibilities
that you wouldn't believe, man.

1030
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,866
Look, man, you're just…

1031
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,951
You're just a little down
and confused, man,

1032
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,119
like your music.

1033
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,454
But you know what?

1034
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,955
You gonna get through it, man.

1035
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:35,042
I guess you're getting through it
the only way you know how, bro.

1036
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,461
I respect that.

1037
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,677
I haven't lost faith in your heart.

1038
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,243
<i>As crazy as</i>
<i>it may sound, Dave's weird</i>

1039
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,205
<i>could actually be the light</i>
<i>at the end of that dark tunnel.</i>

1040
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,960
What the fuck?

1041
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,026
David, motherfucker.

1042
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,165
Oh shit.

1043
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:12,849
Good.

1044
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:34,221
Yo, good morning. What's up?

1045
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,641
Just stopping by.
Meeting Sammy at the mall in a bit.

1046
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,976
-You hungry?
-Morning, man.

1047
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,895
What'd you say? Where are you guys going?

1048
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:42,688
-Maybe I'll meet you later.
-Oh yeah.

1049
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,023
-Yeah.
-Shopping.

1050
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,442
-Not me, her.
-Yeah, I'm sure.

1051
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:49,320
Morning. What's up?

1052
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:52,323
Hey, is anybody going to
the Fil-Am dance tonight?

1053
01:05:52,406 --> 01:05:54,742
-Oh, Mama, that's your thing.
-Can't do it.

1054
01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,702
Tell the titos and titas
that I send my love.

1055
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:00,623
-Yeah, Ma, Deucy has a game at 7:30.
-Yeah, he does, where?

1056
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:03,250
You guys need to start
supporting the Fil-Am.

1057
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:06,754
-Hey, Ma, I already sent a check in.
-Yeah, for all of us, right?

1058
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:08,923
Look, it's not enough
to donate money, okay?

1059
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:12,635
My generation is older now
and the models are passing away.

1060
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,595
It's up to you guys to keep this going.

1061
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:18,224
I'm sorry, Mama, I got to…
I can't make it I got a date.

1062
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:19,392
Oh, a date?

1063
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:23,354
Oh, I wanna know about that date.
Tell us about it.

1064
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:24,689
-What'd he say?
-I don't know.

1065
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:27,400
-Did he say he has a date?
-I think he has a date.

1066
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,443
-Wow.
-Yeah, wow.

1067
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:32,071
-This is good.
-Yeah, it's good, but how?

1068
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,740
-I have no clue.
-It's all good, baby.

1069
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,742
I found some more milk.

1070
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,370
Yeah, so, a date, huh?

1071
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:41,080
Yeah, she was… she…

1072
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:44,959
This girl, she wanted to meet up
and she's really insistent.

1073
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:46,794
Oh yeah.

1074
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:49,922
-Yeah.
-Hey, how'd you meet her?

1075
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,466
-Yeah, where did you meet this girl?
-On my phone.

1076
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,635
-Your phone?
-Yeah, it's an app.

1077
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,555
What, you're on a dating app? All right.

1078
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,765
How does that work?

1079
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,934
You know it's kind of like a… like a bar.

1080
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:03,811
Wait, a bar?

1081
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:06,022
-Virtually.
-Yeah, virtually.

1082
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,690
Dude, it's like a bar, like, on your...

1083
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:10,109
You know how, like,
a bar is like a watering hole, right?

1084
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:12,570
You go there, you meet people?
Except it's on your phone.

1085
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:14,697
-Okay, a bar on my phone.
-Is she cute?

1086
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,407
-That's good, right?
-She's cute.

1087
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,534
Great, man, because
you don't have to buy girls drinks.

1088
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,911
You just swipe, you connect, you know,

1089
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,830
you chat, you talk, you smash.

1090
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,373
I'm just going to go meet her.

1091
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:27,084
She wanted to meet? We're gonna meet.

1092
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:30,004
Okay, that's good. That's good, Danny boy.

1093
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:31,839
Getting out there, huh?

1094
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:33,549
Yo, David, you did this?

1095
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:35,926
It's cool, right?

1096
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,888
-It's hella cool.
-Yeah, okay, yeah.

1097
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,556
I mean, it can't hurt.

1098
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:43,559
Help. That's what I do, man, help.

1099
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:47,063
Okay Mr. Helper, why don't you
go help Lola wipe her butt?

1100
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,191
-What?
-He's coming, Lola.

1107
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:23,808
Hello?

1108
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:27,269
Hi. You came.

1109
01:08:27,353 --> 01:08:28,687
I wasn't sure you'd make it.

1110
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:35,778
No, I, I said I'd come,
so here I am and there you are.

1111
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,323
Good. I think it's important.

1112
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,700
-What?
-That we're honest.

1113
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:42,618
Yeah.

1114
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:46,413
I know it's kind of out of fashion
right now, honesty, truth.

1115
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:50,126
And you're looking at me right now,
and you're probably thinking

1116
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:53,045
that I lied to you in some way,
but I didn't.

1117
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:57,007
I mean I didn't tell you everything, yeah,
okay, but it's just those fucking apps.

1118
01:08:57,091 --> 01:08:59,718
I feel like they lend themselves to lying.

1119
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:03,264
Everybody's putting out their best selves
or what they think are their best selves

1120
01:09:03,347 --> 01:09:05,641
which doesn't have to do with
anything that matters.

1121
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,768
But you didn't do that.

1122
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:09,103
And I don't want to lie to you,

1123
01:09:09,186 --> 01:09:11,188
which is why I didn't say it all
on the app.

1124
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:14,567
I wanted you to get the full picture.

1125
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,238
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1126
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,073
Okay, I see you.

1127
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:22,533
Yeah?

1128
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:24,869
You're beautiful.

1129
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:31,959
We should grab a booth.

1130
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:34,295
Suddenly I'm very hungry, are you hungry?

1131
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:35,880
-I'm starving.
-Good.

1132
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:37,631
-Okay.
-Good.

1133
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:40,593
Okay, this one? Okay.

1134
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:45,139
Okay.

1135
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:47,099
Gosh, I love this place.

1136
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:51,061
It reminds me of this spot
me and my mom used to go to in Queens.

1137
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,229
Yeah, me too, I love it.

1138
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:55,524
I mean, my family and I
have been coming here for years.

1139
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:59,862
It's partially why I agreed to come.
I don't get out much.

1140
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,908
Gracias.

1141
01:10:06,118 --> 01:10:08,078
No, you, you. I want to watch you eat.

1142
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,096
Mm!

1143
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:31,060
-It's so good.
-Yeah, it's my favorite.

1144
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:34,897
So, why not?

1145
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:37,566
Why not what?

1146
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:40,903
You said you don't get out much.
Why is that?

1147
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:45,991
I don't know.
I haven't had the desire, I guess.

1148
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:46,951
Why?

1149
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:50,788
I don't know, to tell you the truth.

1150
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:52,915
You're depressed?

1151
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:58,379
Probably, yeah. Yes, I'm depressed.

1152
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:02,299
I'm… I don't even know
what that means, exactly,

1153
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:05,970
but, yeah, I have been down for sure.

1154
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,723
Look, I don't mean
to come at you, it's just…

1155
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:11,058
Fuck the small talk, you know?

1156
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:12,768
I'm trying to get to know you.

1157
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,728
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

1158
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:19,441
For some reason,
with you it's all right, talking.

1159
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,278
I don't go for small talk either.

1160
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:26,490
Yeah, I could see that.

1161
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:34,957
So what happened?

1162
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:41,213
I don't know. I got lost somewhere

1163
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:43,882
or just lost period,

1164
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,511
and I haven't found my way back yet.

1165
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:52,474
No, no, that sounds stupid.

1166
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:59,898
My girl fell in love with another man
and she left me.

1167
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:04,486
She moved away to Michigan
with our baby, Brandon.

1168
01:12:06,196 --> 01:12:10,826
Made me promise to let her raise
the new kid with a new man.

1169
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:13,329
He was one of
my older brother Dayo's best friends,

1170
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:18,417
and he said he's a good guy,
so at least there's that, right?

1171
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,212
Are you ready to order?

1172
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:24,131
Could you just give us
a minute? Thank you.

1173
01:12:28,886 --> 01:12:32,014
I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible.

1174
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,727
I mean, you must be heartbroken.

1175
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:37,644
Broken?

1176
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,814
My heart is gone. I…

1177
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,610
Fuck my heart. I mean, I…

1178
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:47,237
I mean,

1179
01:12:47,946 --> 01:12:50,115
I'd be fine, you know?

1180
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,786
If my mind and the rest of my body
would just move on.

1181
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,120
I don't believe that.

1182
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:58,123
You're not the type to walk around
in this world without a heart.

1183
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,960
Of course you have a heart,
it's just hiding.

1184
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:04,254
-You don't know me.
-You know what?

1185
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:05,214
I don't know you.

1186
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:08,300
But I'm sitting at this table
looking right at you, and I see you.

1187
01:13:15,682 --> 01:13:16,725
Who are you?

1188
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:22,189
I'm just me.

1189
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,988
Look, I know what it looks like, okay?

1190
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,698
But it was love,

1191
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:35,077
and sometimes love
isn't supposed to last forever.

1192
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,996
Sometimes love exists
just to create other things.

1193
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,249
Like life. Like new chapters.

1194
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:44,795
And, yeah, people can say
what they want about me,

1195
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:46,130
but they don't know me.

1196
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,591
They don't know how it broke.

1197
01:13:49,675 --> 01:13:51,552
How promises were…

1198
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,972
And lies.

1199
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:59,268
And, yeah, okay, there's… It's "my fault,"
like, there's "my part," of course.

1200
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:04,231
But people, they don't know
what really happened.

1201
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:08,777
And that's not what this date
is about. Anyway, so.

1202
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:16,160
Hey, will you take me dancing?

1203
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:18,871
-Dancing?
-Mm-hmm.

1204
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:23,375
-You wanna go to a club, now?
-No, no, I don't, not really.

1205
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,334
I just…

1206
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:26,879
I…

1207
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,380
We're on this date,

1208
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:32,217
and I wanna do date stuff.

1209
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,179
I wanna go dancing.

1210
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:36,805
I can't drink, so I just wanna…

1211
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:40,017
Right. You want me to take you dancing?

1212
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:42,978
Yeah.

1213
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:48,066
Okay.

1214
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:50,736
Yeah?

1215
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,905
Cool, okay.

1216
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:28,357
I'm sorry.

1217
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,441
Are you kidding?

1218
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,068

01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:27,499

Theresa hold on.

1249
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:20,320
What's the matter?

1250
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:21,905
Nothing. Leave me alone.

1251
01:18:21,988 --> 01:18:24,199
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine, leave me alone.

1252
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:26,618
-Where are you going?
-I don't know. It doesn't matter.

1253
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:29,079
-What are you talking about?
-What are you doing?

1254
01:18:29,913 --> 01:18:31,373
Who the fuck are you, man?

1255
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:34,209
Leave me alone. Go home.

1256
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:37,629
I'm not gonna leave you here.

1257
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,673
You asked me to come and meet you.

1258
01:18:39,756 --> 01:18:42,134
Yeah, but I didn't ask for that.

1259
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:44,761
You said you wanted to go dancing,
so I took you dancing.

1260
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,763
I didn't ask for this. It's too much.

1261
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:52,519
I'm just starting
to get my feet on the ground,

1262
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:56,106
and I've done this already,
I have been here before.

1263
01:18:56,189 --> 01:18:57,899
And I'm not gonna let you do this to me.

1264
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,317
I can't afford it. I'm too weak.

1265
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:02,904
Plus I'm not even thinking about
just me anymore,

1266
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,115
and this is not your responsibility.

1267
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:07,951
We are not your responsibility.

1268
01:19:08,493 --> 01:19:10,287
Not like you can do anything
about it anyway.

1269
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:12,038
You can't even locate your fucking heart.

1270
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,500
I'm sorry.

1271
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:19,629
Just, this was a mistake.

1272
01:19:20,213 --> 01:19:22,758
-All right, I'm going home.
-Don't do that.

1273
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:23,884
Do what? Do what?

1274
01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:26,011
You said before
honesty was important to you.

1275
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:28,305
It is, and I am being honest.

1276
01:19:28,388 --> 01:19:30,515
With me, maybe, but not with yourself.

1277
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:33,393
You talk about yourself
like you're some kind of weak little thing

1278
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:36,062
that everything just happens to,
but that ain't true.

1279
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,648
You made all this happen,

1280
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,525
and not because you're weak

1281
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:42,277
but because you're strong.

1282
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,489
You're like the sun.

1283
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:47,407
The big, beautiful sun

1284
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:52,078
that comes out and shines after
every storm no matter what.

1285
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:54,998
You have the heart of a beast

1286
01:19:55,081 --> 01:19:56,416
and I feel it so strong

1287
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,085
because I haven't even felt
my own heart in so long.

1288
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:02,923
God, I am so sorry.

1289
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,265
Look, when all this happened,

1290
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:15,560
when I found out I was pregnant and he

1291
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:17,437
left,

1292
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:20,816
I thought that I was gonna die.

1293
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:25,821
And it sounds stupid,
but I prayed on three wishes

1294
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:27,864
like that was gonna
make everything better.

1295
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,199
It was like a hope of a new life.

1296
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:33,578
I'm good.

1297
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:39,251
Anyway, my mom, she likes to shop,

1298
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:42,087
and I guess this piece didn't suit her

1299
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:45,006
because today she left it on my bed for me

1300
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,299
and I love yellow.

1301
01:20:48,426 --> 01:20:50,095
I wished for a new dress.

1302
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:54,432
I wished for someone to take me dancing.

1303
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:58,812
And I wanted a guy to sing in my ear.

1304
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:01,523
-Teresa…
-And…

1305
01:21:02,649 --> 01:21:04,150
Come to my place.

1306
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:07,654
Danny.

1307
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:10,198
I want you to listen to my music.

1308
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:13,243
It's all I've been able
to do all this time,

1309
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:15,537
and I want you to hear it.

1310
01:21:23,169 --> 01:21:24,004
Okay.

1311
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:27,632
You ready?

1312
01:21:28,758 --> 01:21:29,885
Okay, good.

1313
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,136
We gotta put these on.

1314
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:33,013
Sorry, everybody's asleep.

1315
01:21:33,096 --> 01:21:34,598
-It's no problem.
-Okay.

1316
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:35,682
Okay.

1317
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,688
Okay, here we go.

1318
01:21:58,538 --> 01:21:59,873
It's bad, huh?

1319
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:03,209
I mean, I told you I've been down.

1320
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:04,753
It's cluttered.

1321
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:07,297
There's a lot of dissonance in there.

1322
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,924
Yeah, it's super dark.

1323
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,384
But there's something there.

1324
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:12,928
Yeah?

1325
01:22:13,511 --> 01:22:15,764
-Yeah, my cousin.
-Mm-hmm?

1326
01:22:15,847 --> 01:22:18,099
Uh, he had one of these.

1327
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:24,606
I heard this podcast about this nurse

1328
01:22:24,689 --> 01:22:31,404
who got all the dissonant sounds
in the hospital room in tune,

1329
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,740
and it helped heal the patient.

1330
01:22:34,574 --> 01:22:35,951
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1331
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:39,579
Just… just little tweaks

1332
01:22:41,164 --> 01:22:42,791
can make a big difference.

1333
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,298
Beauty in the chaos.

1334
01:22:54,094 --> 01:22:55,053
Who are you?

1335
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:59,307
I told you, I'm just me.

1336
01:23:10,026 --> 01:23:12,654
This is crazy.

1337
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:14,948
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1338
01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:16,366
All this is…

1339
01:23:17,033 --> 01:23:19,661
It's happening so fast, and, like,

1340
01:23:19,744 --> 01:23:23,081
I have all these feelings that
I haven't felt in so long.

1341
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:24,541
I wanted to, I wanna say...

1342
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:27,919
Danny, you know what? It's late.

1343
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:32,841
Why don't we just not talk, and listen?

1344
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:36,094
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay?

1345
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:37,762
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1346
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,015
-Okay.
-Okay.

1347
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:49,399
Yo, morning. You're cooking longganisa?

1348
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:50,734
Yeah, come sit down.

1349
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:53,611
-Good morning. Where's Sammy?
-She had an appointment.

1350
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:55,905
Ma, I gotta take care of the kids.

1351
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:58,908
So, how'd it go?

1352
01:23:58,992 --> 01:24:00,910
-What?
-The date?

1353
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:04,205
-Oh yeah, the date.
-Yeah, I don't know, man.

1354
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:06,458
He got in late, so he's still sleeping.

1355
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:07,917
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

1356
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,045
-How late?
-I don't know, bro. Late.

1357
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:12,047
Like, I was up,
but yeah, I think it was late.

1358
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:14,716
-Well, that's good news, right?
-Yeah, it's progress.

1359
01:24:14,799 --> 01:24:18,219
I mean, it's been a few years since he's
been out of the house, you know?

1360
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,013
So, it's good.

1361
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,222
Good.

1362
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:22,474
Good, right?

1363
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,310
Yes, David, you did a good job, okay?

1364
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:28,438
I'm just saying, man. Just give me
some credit where credit's due, okay?

1365
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:30,231
'Cause there are some things
I don't know about,

1366
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:32,650
but then there are some things
that I kind of know about.

1367
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,569
Yeah, well, what do you know
about this fried rice right here?

1368
01:24:34,652 --> 01:24:37,113
-It's SPAM.
-Oh, yo, yo, good morning.

1369
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:40,700
-Morning, son.
-Pop.

1370
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,453
So?

1371
01:24:43,536 --> 01:24:44,496
"So"?

1372
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:46,498
How was your date?

1373
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:48,666
Hey, can you just let
the guy have his coffee?

1374
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:49,626
I'm just asking.

1375
01:24:49,709 --> 01:24:51,628
What? He's not wrong.
Let the man have his coffee.

1376
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:54,089
- I just wanna know what's happening.
- Good.

1377
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:55,048
What?

1378
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:56,216
Good. The date.

1379
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:58,468
It actually went kind of good.

1380
01:24:58,551 --> 01:25:01,012
Well, see, there you go, man,
shit went good.

1381
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,973
-I mean good like how good?
-Yeah, I mean who is she?

1382
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:05,183
Is she a nice girl?

1383
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:06,810
Well, she's here.

1384
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:07,769
-What?
-She's here?

1385
01:25:07,852 --> 01:25:10,313
-You brought her home last night?
-Well, yeah, I'm sorry.

1386
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:12,941
I would have let you know,
but I was late, you know, so.

1387
01:25:13,024 --> 01:25:15,276
No, it's okay, we're just surprised,
right, guys?

1388
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,528
Good surprised.

1389
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:19,197
Hey, did you guys fuck last night?

1390
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,698
David!

1391
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,534
-What?
-The fucking kids, man.

1392
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:23,576
- Dayo.
- David.

1393
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:26,621
What? I'm just saying
what everyone's thinking.

1394
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:29,082
You calm down, you guys,
she's sleeping up there.

1395
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:31,209
- Oh no, she's up.
- She's awake?

1396
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,670
- What?
- She's… I was just getting her some tea.

1397
01:25:33,753 --> 01:25:36,673
-Well, if she's up, bringing her down.
-Yeah, we have breakfast, man.

1398
01:25:36,756 --> 01:25:38,967
- Come and eat.
- Tea ain't breakfast.

1399
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:41,678
- Some Filipino breakfast.
- …brother, man.

1400
01:25:41,761 --> 01:25:44,347
-Let her know how us Filipinos roll.
-Okay, I'll go get her.

1401
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:46,683
All right, go… Yeah, man.

1402
01:25:46,766 --> 01:25:47,809
-Wow.
-Damn.

1403
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:49,644
I didn't know he was gonna bring her home.

1404
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:52,272
I can't believe
he brought her home last night. Yo!

1405
01:25:52,355 --> 01:25:53,773
I wasn't ready to meet…

1406
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:56,109
I will, okay.

1407
01:25:56,192 --> 01:25:58,069
- Hi.
- Looks good, guys, looks good.

1408
01:26:07,579 --> 01:26:10,415
So this is Duke.

1409
01:26:10,957 --> 01:26:12,959
- Hi.
- Pleasure.

1410
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,879
-Hey, I'm David.
-Hello.

1411
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:18,506
-Yeah, you're welcome.
-He's the youngest brother.

1412
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,009
-Oh, you're the one who did the app.
-Gotcha.

1413
01:26:21,092 --> 01:26:22,302
Okay.

1414
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:24,762
And this is my oldest brother, Dayo.

1415
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:27,515
Dayo, hi. Teresa.

1416
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,684
-Yo, what the fuck is going on here?
-Dayo, man!

1417
01:26:29,767 --> 01:26:32,562
What is this?
Is this some kind of joke or something?

1418
01:26:32,645 --> 01:26:36,191
-David, you're the one who set them up.
-What?

1419
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,318
Hey, I'm so sorry, my family...

1420
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:39,861
You seem really cool. Are you okay?

1421
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:42,405
-Oh, yeah, yeah, it's just Braxton-Hicks.
-Braxton what?

1422
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:45,116
-It's contractions. Fake contractions.
-Oh. Hey!

1423
01:26:48,244 --> 01:26:51,039
-You put your brother...
-Dayo, no, he did a good thing!

1424
01:26:51,122 --> 01:26:54,209
Okay, listen, everybody.
Everybody, listen.

1425
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,252
Listen. This…

1426
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:58,713
This is Teresa, okay.

1427
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:01,758
She's pregnant yeah, very, very pregnant.

1428
01:27:01,841 --> 01:27:06,054
But she's also resilient a-and beautiful

1429
01:27:06,137 --> 01:27:09,182
and so alive and strong, and…

1430
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:12,101
I don't even know how we met.
Okay? It's crazy.

1431
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:15,438
I can't even understand it,
but she sees me,

1432
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:18,858
and I her, okay?

1433
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:20,151
I know…

1434
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,737
I know I've been, I've been
messed up in the head

1435
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:25,323
for a long time now, but, but…

1436
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:29,661
Dayo, you've been,
you've been very kind to me,

1437
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:31,204
and I appreciate that,

1438
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:33,581
but I'm asking you,

1439
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:36,793
please, please be kind to her too, okay?

1440
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:38,044
Because…

1441
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:41,923
I fell in love with her.

1442
01:27:45,843 --> 01:27:47,178
Wow.

1443
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,888
- Okay.
- That's sweet.

1444
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:51,266
This is awesome.

1445
01:27:52,725 --> 01:27:55,395
You motherfucker!

1446
01:27:55,478 --> 01:27:56,854
Hey!

1447
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:00,149
- Wait!
- Damn it! Goddamn it!

1448
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:01,484
What are you...?

1449
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:04,529
You guys are making fools of yourselves
in front of this woman.

1450
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:06,990
That's okay, Mr. Abasta.

1451
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:10,952
When are you guys gonna grow up?
Show some responsibility?

1452
01:28:13,705 --> 01:28:15,164
I've had it with you guys.

1453
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:18,751
You boys think you rule everything.

1454
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:21,004
All I see is you running away.

1455
01:28:21,087 --> 01:28:23,339
From your culture. From yourself.

1456
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:25,925
Do you think you have control over love?

1457
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:28,219
When it happens? Who it happens to?

1458
01:28:28,761 --> 01:28:30,555
As if you have a say.

1459
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:33,016
But we know better, don't we?

1460
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:38,479
Thank you.

1461
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:39,897
He's a good man.

1462
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:43,151
A bit bruised,
but he comes from good roots.

1463
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:46,154
You can't tell by all the commotion
between his brothers,

1464
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:49,741
but if you can love him,
who are we to judge?

1465
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:52,785
Yeah, bro, don't judge.

1466
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:58,958
I think my water just broke.

1467
01:28:59,042 --> 01:29:00,668
What?

1468
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:02,587
It's in my mouth.

1469
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,714
She said she had
Toni Braxton cramps!

1470
01:29:04,797 --> 01:29:08,509
-Oh man, what are we going to do now?
-Get Doris, she's a nurse.

1471
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:15,975
These brothers,
these fabulous Filipino brothers,

1472
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:17,852
are my brothers.

1473
01:29:17,935 --> 01:29:20,772
Yeah, I'm the youngest, the sister.

1474
01:29:20,855 --> 01:29:23,608
To which you say,
"I didn't know they had a sister."

1475
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:26,944
And that's when I say,
"Yes, story of my life."

1476
01:29:27,987 --> 01:29:31,574
For a lot of families,
especially Filipino families,

1477
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:32,742
it's all about the boys.

1478
01:29:32,825 --> 01:29:36,204
And I admit, yes, in my life,
it's been all about these boys.

1479
01:29:36,287 --> 01:29:39,791
But while they're running around
making a mess,

1480
01:29:39,874 --> 01:29:41,000
make no mistake,

1481
01:29:41,584 --> 01:29:44,462
it's the women in the family
who hold it down.

1482
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:48,382
How far apart are the contractions?

1483
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:50,593
I don't know, I haven't been
timing them. Ow! Ow!

1484
01:29:50,676 --> 01:29:53,346
It's okay. You're gonna be okay,
you just gotta breathe.

1485
01:29:53,429 --> 01:29:55,056
-Okay, okay.
-This is Teresa.

1486
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:56,849
I am Doris, I am the sister.

1487
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,059
Good one, David.

1488
01:29:58,142 --> 01:30:00,770
Let's get her in the hospital. Get her up.
Get her purse, David.

1489
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:02,939
Why me?
Why do I have to get the purse?

1490
01:30:03,022 --> 01:30:05,983
-I'm not going to make it.
-Stop, everybody. Turn it around.

1491
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:07,902
-On the table.
-Clear the food.

1492
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:11,697
Dayo, get the gloves!
Danny boy, get some pillows!

1493
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:14,158
-Let's go. It's okay, I got you.
-There's food here.

1494
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:16,285
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

1495
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:18,287
There we go. There we go.

1496
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:20,164
- Towels!
- I got the purse!

1497
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:22,542
-Here are the gloves.
-You're late!

1498
01:30:23,417 --> 01:30:26,087
- Then you're gonna push.
- Okay.

1499
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:27,588
-Here it comes.
-Here it comes.

1500
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,465
- And, push!
- Push!

1501
01:30:39,183 --> 01:30:41,060
Good job, Felix.

1502
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:43,855
Cheese.

1503
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:45,815
Okay, let's go, one crazy.

1504
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:06,127
-Seven iron all day, I'll beat you.
-David.

1505
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:07,503
-David.
-What?

1506
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:10,173
-I'd like you to meet your cousin.
-Cousin?

1507
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:14,552
Cousin's wife's sister
on Tita Beverly's side.

1508
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:17,972
And she's recently divorced.

1509
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:21,100
What's up, cuz?

1510
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:26,606
<i>♪ Do you want to make it better… ♪</i>

1511
01:31:26,689 --> 01:31:29,942
Where is my princess,
my foxy princess?

1512
01:31:31,694 --> 01:31:35,948
There she is, oh, looking like
a Burmese Beyoncé, hey.

1513
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:38,242
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-What do you mean?

1514
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:41,245
Is that the way you greet me?

1515
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:44,415
That's what I'm saying.

1516
01:31:44,498 --> 01:31:48,628
-I don't speak Manny Pacquiao.
-Okay, Bert, come on, man.

1517
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:51,964
Excuse me, Bert!

1518
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:55,259
You said you weren't
gonna be crazy.

1519
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:58,095
-Your breath smells like dolphin feet!
-Shh! Grandma will hear!

1520
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,848
Dayo, you didn't ask your sister
