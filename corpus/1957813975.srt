You're early.

41
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,110
I was still getting ready.

42
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:58,322
(sighs) I know... I know this is weird.

43
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,282
I-I wanted to...

44
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,994
I did try and call ahead of time
to explain things, but...

45
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,748
Um... anyway, it doesn't matter.

46
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,416
You're here now.

47
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:13,295
And look at you.

48
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,005
So grown up.

49
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,049
You're gaining on me.

50
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,679
Believe me, I...

51
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,722
I hate that you have to see me like this,

52
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:26,350
but it's nothing to be afraid of.

53
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,352
It's still me under here.

54
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,065
Mommy just had a...

55
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,442
a little procedure.

56
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:36,860
A surgery.

57
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,862
Are you sick?

58
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,823
No, no, I'm not sick. I promise.

59
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,658
Everything's fine.

60
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,035
It's just...

61
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:48,122
I don't know, I needed a...

62
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,290
change, fresh start.

63
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,294
You know, like, when a car gets older

64
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:57,214
and you have to take it in for repairs?

65
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,758
People can be like that, too.

66
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:02,469

Sometimes you just need a little tune-up.

67
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,472
Dad didn't say anything.

68
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,979
Well, I was hoping

69
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,815
this could be our little secret.

70
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,693

she looks like under there?

75
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,625
Remember when we saw
that raccoon that got run over

76
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,709
and there was all that,
like, blood and white stuff

77
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,963
- all over the road? (retches)
- Ew. Stop. Stop it.

78
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,607
- Gross. Stop it. That's Mom!
- Probably like that

79
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,109
but all over Mom's face, like... (groans)

80
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,733
- Like, oozing blood...
- I said stop it!

81
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,428
MOTHER:
Is there something wrong?

82
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,099
- Nope.
- No, Mommy.

83
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,517
Okay, good.

84
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,479
I just wanted everything to be perfect.

85
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,774
Anyway, I, um... I got you something,

86
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,027
but you got here
before I had a chance to wrap it.

87
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,781
What is it?

88
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:05,949
An F-18 Super Hornet.

89
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,330
So you like it?

90
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,123
- So much. Thank you, Mommy.
- Yeah.

91
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,291
Oh, good.

92
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,877
Now, if I can get you to help me

93
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,172
with a few little house rules.

94
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:22,091
Just while Mommy's healing.

95
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:24,510
Rules?

96
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,095
Like what?

97
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,180
Easy things.

98
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,682
Like no running or shouting in the house,

99
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,685
and no visitors or play dates.

100
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,355
Just for a while,
just for some peace and quiet.

101
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,857
And the sun,
it's not good for Mommy's skin,

102
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,652
so let's keep the blinds closed.

103
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:46,657
And my office and my bedroom: off-limits.

104
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,325
So's the barn.

105
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,161
Uh, but what about if...

106
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,080

107
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,582
What Mommy says goes.

108
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,751

109
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,587
