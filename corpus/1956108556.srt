HE'S REALLY GOOD, AND...

1559
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:58,810
I'LL PAY FOR EVERYTHING.

1560
01:09:58,912 --> 01:10:00,044
DON'T WORRY.

1561
01:10:00,146 --> 01:10:02,180
IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT.

1562
01:10:02,282 --> 01:10:04,282
IT'LL ALL WORK OUT.

1563
01:10:04,384 --> 01:10:05,684
HE'S MY LAWYER.

1564
01:10:05,786 --> 01:10:07,819
HE LOVES STICKIN' IT
TO PEOPLE.

1565
01:10:07,921 --> 01:10:09,554
OH, AND-- AND THE GIFTS.

1566
01:10:09,656 --> 01:10:11,590
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
DELIVERING THE GIFTS.

1567
01:10:11,692 --> 01:10:12,557
THEY'RE JUNK.

1568
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:13,792
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

1569
01:10:13,894 --> 01:10:16,060
I HAVE SOMETHING BETTER
PLANNED FOR THE CREW.

1570
01:10:16,162 --> 01:10:17,496
BESIDES,

1571
01:10:17,598 --> 01:10:19,898
YOU SHOULD SPEND TONIGHT
WITH LILY.

1572
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,601
AND WHOEVER ELSE YOU MIGHT
WANNA SPEND IT WITH.

1573
01:10:22,703 --> 01:10:24,002
I GOTTA GO TO MAKEUP.

1574
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:29,474
MMM!

1575
01:10:29,576 --> 01:10:30,475
HEY, YOU!

1576
01:10:30,577 --> 01:10:32,711
[MOANS]
COME OVER HERE.

1577
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:34,980
P.A.: JIMMY
TO THE GREENROOM.

1578
01:10:35,081 --> 01:10:37,482
JIMMY, PLEASE GO
TO THE GREENROOM.

1579
01:10:37,584 --> 01:10:39,718
I'M SORRY, MS. CARTMAN.

1580
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,019
I KNOW YOU SAID
THAT I WASN'T--

1581
01:10:41,121 --> 01:10:42,153
WHAT DO YOU
HAVE THERE?

1582
01:10:42,255 --> 01:10:43,722
JIMMY SAID
TO GET THE TOYS

1583
01:10:43,824 --> 01:10:45,690
AND THE STUFF
FOR THE FOSTER KIDS

1584
01:10:45,792 --> 01:10:46,992
AND MAKE SURE
THEY GET THEM

1585
01:10:47,093 --> 01:10:49,093
SINCE YOU WOULDN'T LET THEM
ON THE SHOW TODAY.

1586
01:10:49,195 --> 01:10:50,194
REALLY.

1587
01:10:50,296 --> 01:10:51,663
YES, MA'AM.

1588
01:10:51,765 --> 01:10:53,965
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

1589
01:10:54,067 --> 01:10:56,568
YOU TAKE THOSE TOYS
BACK TO THE STUDIO,

1590
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:57,802
BECAUSE TODAY...

1591
01:10:57,905 --> 01:11:00,138
WE'RE GONNA GIVE THEM
TO THE FOSTER KIDS.

1592
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,773
WE ARE?
YES, WE ARE,

1593
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:04,242
AND THEN I WANT YOU TO GO
TO THE PRODUCTION ACCOUNTANT

1594
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:06,678
AND HAVE HIM GIVE YOU
AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU NEED

1595
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:08,647
TO DOUBLE WHAT WE HAVE.

1596
01:11:08,749 --> 01:11:10,015
WHAT?

1597
01:11:13,153 --> 01:11:15,253
NOW, YOU GET MOVIN',

1598
01:11:15,355 --> 01:11:16,788
BEFORE I DECIDE
NOT TO GIVE YOU

1599
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:19,190
THAT NICE
CHRISTMAS BONUS.

1600
01:11:19,993 --> 01:11:21,993
YES, MA'AM.

1601
01:11:22,095 --> 01:11:23,261
[LAUGHS]

1602
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:25,463
JOY TO THE WORLD.

1603
01:11:30,582 --> 01:11:33,450
MORGAN, WE ARE SO EXCITED
TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW.

1604
01:11:33,552 --> 01:11:34,718
I CAN'T WAIT
TO TALK TO YOU

1605
01:11:34,819 --> 01:11:37,086
ABOUT ALL THE WONDERFUL
CHARITY WORK YOU DO.

1606
01:11:37,188 --> 01:11:40,089
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S
TRULY BROUGHT ME HAPPINESS.

1607
01:11:40,191 --> 01:11:41,691
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS
REALLY REWARDING,

1608
01:11:41,793 --> 01:11:45,061
BUT AROUND THE HOLIDAYS, IT JUST
MAKES IT EXTRA SPECIAL, YOU KNOW?

1609
01:11:45,163 --> 01:11:47,230
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU'RE DOING,

1610
01:11:47,332 --> 01:11:48,498
HELPING PEOPLE.

1611
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,467
THANK YOU.

1612
01:11:50,569 --> 01:11:52,435
NOW, DON'T BE SURPRISED
IF FROM NOW ON

1613
01:11:52,537 --> 01:11:55,204
YOU SEE ME DOWN THERE
JUST LENDING A HELPING HAND,

1614
01:11:55,307 --> 01:11:56,573
HEY, I'M GONNA
HOLD YOU TO THAT.

1615
01:11:56,675 --> 01:11:57,574
OK.

1616
01:11:57,676 --> 01:11:58,642
EXCUSE ME, MS. MADDOX.

1617
01:11:58,744 --> 01:12:00,009
CAROL, WE NEED YOU
IN WARDROBE.

1618
01:12:00,111 --> 01:12:01,077
WE'RE LIVE IN 30.

1619
01:12:01,179 --> 01:12:02,145
JIMMY, TELL THEM
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

1620
01:12:02,247 --> 01:12:04,147
I DON'T WANT ANYONE
WAITING FOR ME.

1621
01:12:04,249 --> 01:12:06,516
OH, SORRY. ONE SECOND.

1622
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:08,151
JIMMY, NOW, I DON'T WANT

1623
01:12:08,253 --> 01:12:10,654
TO SOUND CONTROLLING
OR ANYTHING,

1624
01:12:10,756 --> 01:12:12,455
BUT I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD USE THAT SANTA.

1625
01:12:12,557 --> 01:12:13,490
WHY NOT?

1626
01:12:13,592 --> 01:12:15,725
'CAUSE IT'S NOT RIGHT.

1627
01:12:15,827 --> 01:12:17,193
IT'S NOT RIGHT
TO MAKE FUN OF HIM...

1628
01:12:17,296 --> 01:12:18,695
OR THIS HOLIDAY.

1629
01:12:18,797 --> 01:12:20,697
WELL, HAL'S NOT GONNA BE
TOO HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

1630
01:12:20,799 --> 01:12:22,299
YOU GO TELL HAL

1631
01:12:22,401 --> 01:12:25,435
THAT WE ARE GONNA GIVE
HIM A FABULOUS SHOW,

1632
01:12:25,537 --> 01:12:27,671
AND WE WON'T HAVE TO
LOWER OURSELVES.

1633
01:12:27,773 --> 01:12:29,038
OK.

1634
01:12:31,876 --> 01:12:33,176
THANK YOU.

1635
01:12:33,278 --> 01:12:35,712
MORGAN, I'D LOVE TO TALK
TO YOU MORE LATER ABOUT THIS.

1636
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:38,047
YEAH.
SEE YA OUT THERE. OK.

1637
01:12:39,718 --> 01:12:43,553
Jimmy: AND WE ARE BACK
IN 5...4...

1638
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:45,021
3...

1639
01:12:45,123 --> 01:12:46,122
2...

1640
01:12:46,224 --> 01:12:47,390
[APPLAUSE]

1641
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:48,358
Announcer: WELCOME BACK

1642
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:52,629
TO CAROL'S LIVE
CHRISTMAS EVE SPECIAL.

1643
01:12:52,731 --> 01:12:53,763
I GOTTA TELL YOU,

1644
01:12:53,865 --> 01:12:55,665
UP UNTIL
A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

1645
01:12:55,767 --> 01:12:56,833
I DIDN'T WANNA
DO THIS SHOW,

1646
01:12:56,935 --> 01:12:59,469
BUT I HAVE
BEEN GIVEN A GIFT.

1647
01:12:59,571 --> 01:13:03,340
I HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE BEST
CHRISTMAS GIFT EVER.

1648
01:13:03,442 --> 01:13:05,274
I HAVE BEEN GIVEN
THE OPPORTUNITY

1649
01:13:05,377 --> 01:13:07,977
TO HOLD THE SPIRIT
OF CHRISTMAS IN MY HEART

1650
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:09,412
NOT JUST THIS TIME OF YEAR,

1651
01:13:09,514 --> 01:13:11,348
BUT ALL YEAR LONG.

1652
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:13,316
I HAVE ALSO BEEN GIVEN
THE OPPORTUNITY

1653
01:13:13,418 --> 01:13:15,117
TO THANK SOME PEOPLE,

1654
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:17,186
AND I WANNA THANK THE PEOPLE

1655
01:13:17,288 --> 01:13:20,757
THAT HAVE MADE THIS SHOW
SO SUCCESSFUL.

1656
01:13:24,996 --> 01:13:27,497
MY WONDERFUL,
WONDERFUL CREW.

1657
01:13:27,599 --> 01:13:29,999
[APPLAUSE]

1658
01:13:35,106 --> 01:13:37,407
AND TO THANK THEM PROPERLY,

1659
01:13:37,509 --> 01:13:39,709
I WANNA SHARE MY SUCCESS
WITH THEM.

1660
01:13:39,811 --> 01:13:43,513
SO NO SOAP AND SHAMPOO
THIS YEAR.

1661
01:13:43,615 --> 01:13:45,548
AS SOON AS WE GET
OUR NEXT BREAK,

1662
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:50,119
I AM TAKING MY ENTIRE CREW
AND STAFF

1663
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:51,521
AND THEIR FAMILIES--

1664
01:13:51,623 --> 01:13:52,689
TO HAWAII.

1665
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:54,858
[CROWD GASPS AND MURMURS]

1666
01:13:54,959 --> 01:13:57,960
[APPLAUSE]
OH, MY GOD!

1667
01:14:00,932 --> 01:14:04,166
THIS IS WHAT THIS HOLIDAY
IS ALL ABOUT.

1668
01:14:04,269 --> 01:14:05,502
IT'S A TIME TO HELP PEOPLE

1669
01:14:05,604 --> 01:14:08,037
WHO MIGHT BE LESS FORTUNATE
THAN YOU.

1670
01:14:08,139 --> 01:14:09,171
IT'S A TIME TO CELEBRATE

1671
01:14:09,274 --> 01:14:12,341
ALL THE GOOD THINGS
THAT YOU HAVE,

1672
01:14:12,444 --> 01:14:13,910
AND IT'S A TIME
TO BE THANKFUL

1673
01:14:14,012 --> 01:14:15,578
FOR YOUR BLESSINGS.

1674
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,416
THIS FEELING SHOULDN'T
JUST BE THIS TIME OF YEAR.

1675
01:14:19,518 --> 01:14:20,784
IT SHOULD BE ALL YEAR LONG,

1676
01:14:20,886 --> 01:14:25,054
SO I HAVE A VERY SPECIAL
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

1677
01:14:25,156 --> 01:14:26,556
I HAVE BEEN HOUNDED
FOR YEARS

1678
01:14:26,658 --> 01:14:28,892
FROM DIFFERENT COMPANIES
WANTING TO PUT MY NAME

1679
01:14:28,993 --> 01:14:31,795
ON BEAUTY PRODUCTS
AND CLOTHING LINES,

1680
01:14:31,897 --> 01:14:33,362
EVEN KITCHENWARE,

1681
01:14:33,465 --> 01:14:34,697
WHICH IS PRETTY RIDICULOUS

1682
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,999
SINCE I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE
THE KITCHEN IS IN MY HOUSE.

1683
01:14:37,101 --> 01:14:39,135
[LAUGHTER]

1684
01:14:39,237 --> 01:14:43,039
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS...

1685
01:14:43,141 --> 01:14:46,208
I DIDN'T WANNA DO IT
UNTIL NOW.

1686
01:14:46,311 --> 01:14:49,412
SO I'VE DECIDED I'M GONNA
LET THEM USE MY NAME,

1687
01:14:49,514 --> 01:14:53,115
AND I'VE ALSO DECIDED
THAT I WANT ALL THE PROFITS

1688
01:14:53,217 --> 01:14:54,918
TO BE USED TO HELP PEOPLE.

1689
01:14:55,019 --> 01:14:57,286
AND I CAN'T THINK
OF A BETTER WAY

1690
01:14:57,388 --> 01:14:59,622
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN
THAN FOR THE PROFITS

1691
01:14:59,724 --> 01:15:04,928
TO GO TO ALL THE HOMELESS
SHELTERS AROUND THE CITY...

1692
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:07,697
THAT MY OLD FRIEND,

1693
01:15:07,799 --> 01:15:09,666
GOOD GUY OF THE YEAR,

1694
01:15:09,768 --> 01:15:11,400
JOHN JOYCE HAS OPENED.

1695
01:15:11,503 --> 01:15:14,504
[APPLAUSE]

1696
01:15:17,442 --> 01:15:19,742
SO...

1697
01:15:19,845 --> 01:15:22,745
HAVE A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS!

1698
01:15:22,848 --> 01:15:25,982
AND BE NICE TO EACH OTHER.

1699
01:15:26,084 --> 01:15:27,517
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

1700
01:15:27,619 --> 01:15:30,052
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

1701
01:15:34,258 --> 01:15:37,159
Director: AND WE'RE OUT.
THAT'S A WRAP, PEOPLE.

1702
01:15:37,261 --> 01:15:38,260
NICE JOB, KID.

1703
01:15:38,363 --> 01:15:39,896
GREAT JOB, CAROL.

1704
01:15:40,632 --> 01:15:42,431
NICE GOIN', BOSS.

1705
01:15:44,769 --> 01:15:46,035
BEAUTIFUL.

1706
01:15:46,137 --> 01:15:47,704
BEAUTIFUL.

1707
01:15:49,908 --> 01:15:51,440
I THINK THAT WAS
AN OK SHOW.

1708
01:15:51,543 --> 01:15:54,377
THAT WAS THE BEST CAROL
CARTMAN SHOW EVER.

1709
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:56,012
MMM. THE BEST
IS YET TO COME.

1710
01:15:56,114 --> 01:15:57,446
Hal, laughing:
OH, CAROL!

1711
01:15:57,549 --> 01:15:59,516
THAT WAS FABULOUS!

1712
01:15:59,618 --> 01:16:01,150
BOY, YOU KEEP
DOING SHOWS LIKE THIS,

1713
01:16:01,252 --> 01:16:03,319
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE ON
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

1714
01:16:03,421 --> 01:16:04,854
HAL, I PLAN ON IT.

1715
01:16:04,956 --> 01:16:06,055
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE SANTA.

1716
01:16:06,157 --> 01:16:07,089
NAH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

1717
01:16:07,191 --> 01:16:08,457
YOU WERE RIGHT.
I WAS WRONG.

1718
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,928
THAT KIND OF THING IS NOT
CAROL CARTMAN SHOW MATERIAL.

1719
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,396
NICE JOB!

1720
01:16:14,198 --> 01:16:15,231
MOMMY, CAN CAROL
COME OVER

1721
01:16:15,333 --> 01:16:17,000
FOR CHRISTMAS
TONIGHT?

1722
01:16:17,101 --> 01:16:18,501
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK I, UH--

1723
01:16:18,603 --> 01:16:19,969
I'LL TAKE A RAIN CHECK.

1724
01:16:20,071 --> 01:16:22,572
THERE'S SOMEWHERE ELSE
I REALLY NEED TO BE TONIGHT.

1725
01:16:25,777 --> 01:16:27,844
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

1726
01:16:27,946 --> 01:16:30,079
All: MERRY CHRISTMAS!

1727
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,433
COME ON, DAD, PLEASE?

1728
01:16:50,535 --> 01:16:52,234
CAN'T WE OPEN ALL
OUR PRESENTS TONIGHT?

1729
01:16:52,336 --> 01:16:53,603
YOU KNOW OUR TRADITION:

1730
01:16:53,705 --> 01:16:54,671
