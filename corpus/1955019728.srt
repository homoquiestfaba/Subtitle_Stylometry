(suspenseful music)

5
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:17,519
[James] I got nothing.

6
00:01:18,552 --> 00:01:20,654
Just rocks.

7
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:23,990
Some sand and more fucking rocks.

8
00:01:24,124 --> 00:01:26,861
Thank you, Sergeant
Hunter, AKA Captain Obvious,

9
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:28,995
for the most impressive Sit-Rep.

10
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:30,364
I'd completely failed to notice

11
00:01:30,498 --> 00:01:33,067
the extensive rock population, myself.

12
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,105
[James] An outcropping to the right.

13
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,674
You see what I'm seeing?

14
00:01:41,374 --> 00:01:42,977
[Tim] Holy shit.

15
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,645
Up 200 meters.

16
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:50,350
Well, well, well, the boy
came out to play after all.

17
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:56,189
(gunshots)

18
00:01:56,323 --> 00:01:57,325
Are we compromised?

19
00:01:57,457 --> 00:01:58,626
Negative.

20
00:02:00,627 --> 00:02:02,096
(crying)

21
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:09,269
The fuck are they doing down there?

22
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:24,184
(gunshots)

23
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:25,151
Shit.

24
00:02:25,285 --> 00:02:26,853
[James] Ease up. Keep eyes on.

25
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:33,193
(child crying)

26
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:38,266
[Tim] He's on the move.

27
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,867
Can you get a head shot from here?

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,536
We need to take this fucker
out and avoid hitting the kid.

29
00:02:42,568 --> 00:02:44,037
I don't have a clear shot.

30
00:02:44,171 --> 00:02:45,739
[Tim] He's got a kid with a bomb,

31
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:47,340
that could sneak into any market place,

32
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:48,775
from here to Kandahar.

33
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,544
Take the shot.

34
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:54,715
You wanted the pink mist, it's yours.

35
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,451
Take the shot.

36
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:01,456
Control your breathing.

37
00:03:03,156 --> 00:03:04,190
Take the shot.

38
00:03:04,325 --> 00:03:09,329
(suspenseful music)

39
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:13,667
(gunshot)

40
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:24,679
(mysterious music)

41
00:05:02,842 --> 00:05:07,849
(gunfire) (chattering)

42
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:17,091
(upbeat music)

43
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:22,163
[James] We there yet?

44
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:25,565
This doesn't look like the ocean.

45
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:27,300
There's too many trees.

46
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:29,936
[Tim] Just hang on, we're making good time.

47
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,137
[Martha] Is this really you guys?

48
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:32,706
[Tim] Yep, semper fi.

49
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,374
Yeah, okay, seriously though.

50
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:35,709
Do you understand how many

51
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:37,411
likes you could get on footage like this?

52
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,979
[Tim] Hear that, James?

53
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:41,114
My girl thinks we're heroes.

54
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:45,786
[Martha] Baghdraneva...

55
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,322
I love the way it rolls off the tongue.

56
00:05:48,454 --> 00:05:49,957
[James] Just please don't call him that.

57
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,258
Those beads don't make him Hindu.

58
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:53,693
They just make him more likely

59
00:05:53,827 --> 00:05:55,262
to make out with men at raves.

60
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:58,498
[Tim] Hey, hey, keep your
panties on, both of you.

61
00:05:58,632 --> 00:05:59,833
[Martha] Who's wearing panties?

62
00:05:59,966 --> 00:06:00,635
I am.

63
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:02,202
(laughing)

64
00:06:02,336 --> 00:06:07,240
(upbeat music)

65
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:12,445
[Tim] Lost in your phone again.

66
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:13,947
I'm just checking some work emails.

67
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,648
Babe, you work at a
drive-through espresso stand

68
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:17,050
in your bikini all day.

69
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:19,085
How many important work emails do you get?

70
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:21,488
[Martha] I'm the manager, Baby. Tons.

71
00:06:21,622 --> 00:06:22,823
[Tim] Come on, baby, seriously.

72
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:24,158
Put the phone away.

73
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,159
[Martha] I'm just checking some things.

74
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:28,262
[Tim] Oh, babe, come on.

75
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:30,198
Not the Twilight tours again.

76
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:33,300
Tim thinks that I look just like

77
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:35,001
the chick from the movie.

78
00:06:35,135 --> 00:06:37,070
I'm not doing a Twilight tour.

79
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:40,406
You know, actually, did
anybody ever tell you

80
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:42,142
that you look kind of like that Jacob...

81
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:45,078
Oh, yes, I was just thinking that, yes!

82
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:46,046
Totally.

83
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:47,914
[Tim] The native werewolf guy.

84
00:06:48,048 --> 00:06:49,382
It's because of the jaw line.

85
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:50,951
[Tim] The jaw, the nose too though.

86
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:52,319
[James] Enough.

87
00:06:52,452 --> 00:06:54,354
I go away for a couple
tours and I come back,

88
00:06:54,488 --> 00:06:56,423
and not only did he change his name

89
00:06:56,557 --> 00:06:58,225
to Moon Nectar of the fucking gods,

90
00:06:58,358 --> 00:06:59,993
or whatever the shit he calls himself.

91
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:02,230
Now you got him watching
tween flicks as well?

92
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:05,065
What happened to you, man?

93
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,201
[Tim] It's called an awakening, Jimbo.

94
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:09,969
The whole planet's waking up.

95
00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:11,271
[James] Yeah? Waking up to what?

96
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:12,672
A fucking dick in their mouth?

97
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:14,173
Courtesy of the power-elite?

98
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,843
Jesus fucking Christ!

99
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:18,779
Man, the shit you say is just wrong.

100
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:21,649
However, there is one stop
that we do need to make.

101
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:23,383
[James] Another pit stop?

102
00:07:23,517 --> 00:07:25,418
Dude, this is horse's shit, man.

103
00:07:25,553 --> 00:07:27,620
It's gonna be too damned late to even surf,

104
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:30,156
by the time we get to La Push.

105
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:32,358
[Martha] Whatever. Can we get some Cheetos?

106
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:34,560
[Tim] You used to be fat.
You remember that right?

107
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:36,863
You guys are faggots. Shut the fuck up.

108
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:42,002
(upbeat music)

109
00:08:00,553 --> 00:08:02,522
So, this is where your meth guy lives?

110
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:04,792
No, brother, it's not meth we're here for.

111
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:07,061
Believe it or not, in
that white-trash Mecca,

112
00:08:07,194 --> 00:08:09,529
is the key to the sweet-leaf holy grail.

113
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,398
God, you're so random.

114
00:08:11,531 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, and speaking of random,

115
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:15,935
you know that I get surprise
UA's pretty much all the time.

116
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,639
No way I'm smoking up
with you fucking assholes.

117
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:22,175
[Tim] Dude, this ganja
is some next level shit.

118
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:23,810
It's not worth the risk, okay?

119
00:08:23,944 --> 00:08:25,612
You're out of the Corps
now, it's different for you.

120
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:29,350
Those pills you're
taking, are not the answer.

121
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:31,485
Cannabis has medicinal properties, alright?

122
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:33,620
It's not just some
recreational time-waster.

123
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:34,988
Science has my back on this.

124
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:36,457
Yeah, science, bitch.

125
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:40,194
Look, this is a once in
a lifetime opportunity.

126
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:42,128
You go in there, you
get a map that leads you

127
00:08:42,262 --> 00:08:44,131
to a secret grove in the mountains.

128
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:47,033
It'll be a badass
mission, just like before!

129
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,802
I'm not going in.

130
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:51,939
Dude, this ganja is out of this world.

131
00:08:53,373 --> 00:08:56,709
It is not of this earth! Comprende?

132
00:08:56,843 --> 00:08:58,411
Dude, hand me the box, let's go.

133
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:03,416
Thank you.

134
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:06,320
Oh, my god.

135
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:13,259
(crashing)

136
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:20,133
(calypso music)

137
00:09:27,873 --> 00:09:29,375
Sweet-leaf holy grail, huh?

138
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:31,645
Yeah, told you, come on.

139
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:41,821
(ominous music)

140
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:01,142
(knocking)

141
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:08,082
(knocking)

142
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:17,023
Yeah, this is the right place.

143
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:19,825
Namaste.

144
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:24,098
I'm looking for Seth
Guardrail Slaughter, is he in?

145
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,000
- Seth Guardrail Slaughter?
- He's a biker.

146
00:10:36,943 --> 00:10:41,949
(tranquil music)

147
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,235
Dude, what the fuck.

148
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:05,638
Young man, want a little advice?

149
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:06,772
No, man, fuck you.

150
00:11:06,906 --> 00:11:08,007
Jesus...

151
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:14,514
(clapping)

152
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:19,585
What's happening.

153
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:21,387
You must be here about the star leaf.

154
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:23,523
Well, come on up.

155
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:25,959
Always happy to have some close encounters.

156
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:37,537
Glad you could make it.

157
00:11:38,338 --> 00:11:39,139
(laughing)

158
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:40,541
Meet my girls.

159
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:43,009
Aren't they beauties?

160
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:45,377
Speaking of beauty, what in the world

161
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:47,580
do they put in the
water, where you're from?

162
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:48,782
(laughing)

163
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:53,486
What's up man.

164
00:11:55,254 --> 00:11:56,955
Alright, hey, have a seat here.

165
00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:58,291
These pillows ain't just for show.

166
00:11:58,425 --> 00:11:59,593
Take a load off.

167
00:12:00,661 --> 00:12:01,896
My queen.

168
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:07,367
Well, what can I do for you?

169
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,269
Well, we came here for the star leaf map.

170
00:12:10,402 --> 00:12:12,071
[Seth] Of course you did.

171
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:15,008
[Tim] Oh, right, right, of course.

172
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,244
My bad.

173
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:23,317
Total human optimization, gotta love that.

174
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,151
And that's the point, really, isn't it?

175
00:12:25,285 --> 00:12:26,920
Coming back, time and time again,

176
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:29,888
this reality, that reality,

177
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:33,859
perfecting ourselves, slowly
over the course of infinity.

178
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:37,998
It's like, somewhere out
there, is a giant disco-ball,

179
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,800
casting countless reflections.

180
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,969
And each one of us,

181
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:46,406
is a tiny piece of that infinite light.

182
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,141
(chuckling)

183
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:49,642
Dude, shut up.

184
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:52,912
Oh, sorry.

185
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:56,215
Yeah, the brain isn't what
it used to be, since the fall.

186
00:12:56,349 --> 00:12:57,816
That's why I need these babies.

187
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,418
You fell and hurt your head?

188
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:03,022
Well, cosmologically speaking, yes.

189
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:06,126
But not all those that fall, are fallen.

190
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:16,871
What? Did I forget something?

191
00:13:18,238 --> 00:13:20,205
The gummy snacks.

192
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:21,740
Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.

193
00:13:21,874 --> 00:13:23,308
I forgot the gummy snacks.

194
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:25,279
See, this is what happens
when you don't write shit down.

195
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:27,714
The Queen loves the gummy snacks.

196
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,517
That's your favorite. Right, Darling?

197
00:13:30,651 --> 00:13:32,752
You like that watermelon flavor, don't you?

198
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,321
We'll get it next time.

199
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:36,290
Does that mean that we...

200
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:37,825
[Seth] No worries. No worries.

201
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,060
Now, I assume whoever told
you about the star leaf,

202
00:13:40,193 --> 00:13:42,195
clued you into the code of conduct?

203
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:43,497
[Tim] Yes...

204
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:47,299
No photos. No video. No GPS.

205
00:13:47,432 --> 00:13:50,269
You can't take any seeds
or clippings from the site,

206
00:13:50,403 --> 00:13:51,437
although you can smoke as much

207
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,571
as you want, while you're there.

208
00:13:52,705 --> 00:13:53,973
And you gotta destroy the map.

209
00:13:54,107 --> 00:13:55,709
Yeah, and you cannot leave a trace.

210
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:56,877
[Tim] Right, right.

211
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:57,945
- [Seth] Capisce?
- Affirmative.

212
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:00,179
[James] I've seen that before.

213
00:14:00,313 --> 00:14:03,249
(mysterious music)

214
00:14:03,382 --> 00:14:04,817
You can read that?

215
00:14:06,653 --> 00:14:09,355
[James] No, but I saw it when
I was high up in the Kush.

216
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,627
I didn't take you for an O.G. Kush fan.

217
00:14:14,761 --> 00:14:16,296
[James] I'm talking about the Hindu Kush.

218
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,832
The mountain range where we
were fighting for our country.

219
00:14:18,964 --> 00:14:20,834
Not sitting on a fucking puff-pad,

220
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:22,602
getting stoned all fucking day.

221
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,704
[Tim] Okay, okay, you're
gonna have to excuse my friend.

222
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:27,406
He's still decompressing
from his last tour,

223
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,075
and he'll need some time.

224
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:30,243
It took me a while too.

225
00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:31,544
(whispering) Come on, man.

226
00:14:31,677 --> 00:14:32,945
Why is it on your wall?

227
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:34,848
The real question is,

228
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:37,117
why is it still in your head?

229
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:39,619
He got you.

230
00:14:40,652 --> 00:14:41,620
Fuck you guys.

231
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:43,355
(mystical music)

232
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:46,625
All right, who's ready to get weird?

233
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,361
The actual star leaf...

234
00:14:48,494 --> 00:14:49,863
[Seth] Now hold up, Moon-dog.

235
00:14:49,996 --> 00:14:52,132
This is isn't the actual star leaf.

236
00:14:52,265 --> 00:14:54,167
It's just a distant cousin.

237
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,670
Put it in your mouth, baby.

238
00:14:56,802 --> 00:14:58,638
And suck it.

239
00:14:59,906 --> 00:15:04,945
(electronica)

240
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:07,814
You mean to tell me that this star leaf,

241
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,250
is actually from outer space?

242
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:12,618
We are outer space.

243
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:15,522
[Tim] Macrocosms, microcosms...

244
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:17,291
Yeah, that. What he said.

245
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:30,337
The actual star leaf map.

246
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:35,140
[Queen] The map's free.

247
00:15:35,273 --> 00:15:37,710
The journey isn't.

248
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:44,418
(grinding)

249
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,819
Well, I hope you all have a blast.

250
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:49,189
Right out of this world.

251
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:50,190
(poofing)

252
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,757
[Tim] Thank you. Thank you.

253
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:54,094
Thank you both for your hospitality.

254
00:15:55,695 --> 00:15:56,863
Thanks.

255
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,300
[Seth] From the halls of Montezuma,

256
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:05,405
to the shores of Tripoli.

257
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:08,775
We fight our country's battles

258
00:16:08,908 --> 00:16:11,978
In the air, on land, and sea.

259
00:16:12,112 --> 00:16:15,382
First to fight for right and freedom

260
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:18,919
And to keep our honor clean.

261
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:21,887
We are proud to claim the title

262
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,025
of United States Marines.

263
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:31,130
(ominous music)

264
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:52,919
[Martha] Whoa! It is sexy as fuck out here.

265
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:55,620
Yeah. It beats dirty-ass hippy drug dens.

266
00:16:55,754 --> 00:16:56,856
Yeah.

267
00:16:56,989 --> 00:16:59,392
How far away is La Push from here?

268
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:01,060
Dude, the beach ain't going anywhere.

269
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:03,630
We've got an adventure in
these woods here, first.

270
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:08,035
I mean, are you sure we're
even in the right place?

271
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:09,902
Yeah, dude.

272
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:11,403
Look at the marking right there.

273
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:13,574
There's tons of them, all down this road.

274
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:15,609
Dude, check your bag.

275
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:17,009
Make sure you've got all your stuff there.

276
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:18,644
It's a long walk, we
might have to setup camp.

277
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,581
Quick pit stop, my ass, nectar boy.

278
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:22,781
Wait a second.

279
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:24,517
Wait, you said we're camping here?

280
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:26,018
I thought we were camping on the beach.

281
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:28,455
Babe, we can do all that
Twilight tour stuff later.

282
00:17:28,588 --> 00:17:30,155
Come on, this is really important for me.

283
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:32,558
No, no, no, no way, now way.

284
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:35,461
Bella's Sunset tour is
on, bitch. You promised.

285
00:17:35,594 --> 00:17:36,929
He promised.

286
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:39,632
[Tim] Hey, you know Edward
is like 400 years old,

287
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:42,002
and still tries to fuck high school kids.

288
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:44,171
Whatevs.

289
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:45,671
We're just gonna hump all this gear along,

290
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:47,740
in case we camp tonight?

291
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,009
Yeah.

292
00:17:50,142 --> 00:17:51,376
Dude, why don't you
just admit it to yourself

293
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,944
that your whole entire
plan for being up here

294
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:54,580
is to smoke yourself into oblivion.

295
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:56,815
What are you talking about? (laughing)

296
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,219
Just drop the fucking act already, man.

297
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:01,853
No, no, no, I mean, we're
going to find star leaf.

298
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:03,289
And if we find some,

299
00:18:03,422 --> 00:18:05,291
I just think it'd be prudent
of us to smoke a little.

300
00:18:05,424 --> 00:18:07,192
Dude said no photos.

301
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:09,095
Why do you care?

302
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:10,596
[Tim] Come on, babe.

303
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:12,332
Your online fan-base has enough

304
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:14,034
pouty-face selfies for one day.

305
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:15,669
Put it away, come on.

306
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:17,236
What about his stupid camera?

307
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,939
This thing's off, okay?

308
00:18:19,072 --> 00:18:20,440
I just didn't wanna leave it in the car.

309
00:18:20,573 --> 00:18:21,874
I didn't feel like it was safe.

310
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:23,142
Yeah, well, I actually don't safe

311
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:24,811
leaving my iPhone in the car, so...

312
00:18:24,943 --> 00:18:27,813
Babe, Martha, sweetie, come on.

313
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:29,416
- Don't give me that shit.
- I just need you,

314
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:31,550
to play by the rules, this one time.

315
00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:34,787
Promise me you'll turn
it off and keep it off.

316
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:36,555
Why? You know?

317
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:37,990
I mean what's the big deal?

318
00:18:38,123 --> 00:18:40,459
The big deal is that the phone's GPS data

319
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:42,528
will give away the location of the weed.

320
00:18:43,697 --> 00:18:44,998
Fine.

321
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:46,565
I can't believe they
trust us at all, out here.

322
00:18:46,699 --> 00:18:47,534
I wouldn't.

323
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,436
[Tim] Come on, let's giddy-up!

324
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,404
Man sure likes his weed.

325
00:18:52,537 --> 00:18:55,208
He likes a lot of things.

326
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,477
And he isn't afraid to
go after them, either.

327
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:11,191
(upbeat music)

328
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:50,830
(insects chirping)

329
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,535
[Martha] Hey, here, swing back on me.

330
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:01,173
[Tim] Hey, time for chow.

331
00:20:01,307 --> 00:20:02,842
[Martha] Yes, please, I'm so hungry.

332
00:20:02,976 --> 00:20:04,511
Put something in my mouth.

333
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:06,612
Anything.

334
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:07,613
[Tim] Girl, you crazy.

335
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:08,715
(Martha laughing)

336
00:20:08,847 --> 00:20:09,782
[Tim] Take a piece.

337
00:20:15,822 --> 00:20:17,757
Oh, fuck. It tastes like shit.

338
00:20:17,891 --> 00:20:19,793
What's in it? Shit?

339
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:21,127
[Tim] It's my new edible recipe.

340
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,528
Ganesha's groovy granola.

341
00:20:22,662 --> 00:20:23,896
I mean, it could use some more agave.

342
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:25,464
But it's pretty good for homemade.

343
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:26,932
Edible, as in weed edible?

344
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:28,500
[Tim] Yeah.

345
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,402
[James] (spitting) What the
fuck is your problem, man?

346
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:32,772
Two problems. Hungry and sober.

347
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,373
Eat some granola, bam!

348
00:20:34,507 --> 00:20:37,677
Two birds, one stoner.

349
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:40,113
[Martha] What? Oh, whoa my dude's crafty.

350
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:41,180
- Give it up
- [Tim] Yep.

351
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:42,248
[Martha] You got it, baby.

352
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:46,085
(mysterious music)

353
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:47,553
What the F?

354
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:48,889
[Tim] Whoa.

355
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:56,963
Those branches look like alien fingers.

356
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:58,998
Just some random branch configuration.

357
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,299
Nothing to bust a nut on.

358
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:01,600
[Martha] Yeah? Then why is it pointing

359
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:03,236
in the exact direction of the star leaf?

360
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:05,372
Just a random coincidence.

361
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:07,172
James doesn't believe in aliens.

362
00:21:07,306 --> 00:21:08,708
Where's the proof?

363
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:10,009
Ahh...

364
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:11,444
Exactly.

365
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:13,546
[Tim] Come on, man.

366
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,215
Don't tell me you never
even entertained the idea.

367
00:21:15,347 --> 00:21:18,750
Some people say they are the jinn of Islam.

368
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:21,087
Wait, what are the jinn?

369
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,390
Demons.

370
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:26,026
(gunshots)

371
00:21:27,427 --> 00:21:32,466
(upbeat music)

372
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:44,143
(inaudible)

373
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:56,623
Tim?

374
00:21:56,756 --> 00:21:59,559
I have never seen trees like this before.

375
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:04,663
(birds chirping)

376
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,968
[James] Is this on the map?

377
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:09,469
I mean, I think so.

378
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:12,372
I think it's these outlines, right here.

379
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:14,507
I had no idea what those
meant until right now.

380
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,842
That's weird.

381
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:21,982
[Tim] The grove should just be up this way.

382
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,127
Wait, what's with all these bulges?

383
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:36,161
Tree tumors, maybe?

384
00:22:36,295 --> 00:22:38,296
You never complained
about bulging wood before.

385
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,332
Honey, if your wood was bulging like this,

386
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:41,968
I'd take you to a doctor.

387
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:47,540
[Tim] Dude, what if
these are all filled with

388
00:22:47,673 --> 00:22:49,975
the sweetest fucking resin you ever had?

389
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:51,511
We should tap these babies and get some

390
00:22:51,643 --> 00:22:53,445
sweet-ass, star leaf syrup.

391
00:22:53,578 --> 00:22:54,913
[Martha] Woo!

392
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:57,316
Sip, sippin' on some sizzurp.

393
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,617
Help me up.

394
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,555
Sippin' on some sizzurp.
Sippin' on some sizzurp.

395
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:05,158
These branches look sharp enough to kill.

396
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:08,094
Yeah, I guess mother nature
don't take no prisoners, huh?

397
00:23:08,227 --> 00:23:09,396
I mean, either that or she wanted

398
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:12,198
to keep this place a secret for a reason.

399
00:23:12,331 --> 00:23:13,632
Ugh! Ugh!

400
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:16,069
[Tim] Babe, that's not
actually star leaf syrup.

401
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:17,938
[Martha] Well, it's still gross.

402
00:23:32,985 --> 00:23:37,991
(dramatic music)

403
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:45,798
- [Tim] James!
- [Martha] James!

404
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,435
[Tim] James!

405
00:23:55,507 --> 00:23:56,910
(clapping)

406
00:23:57,543 --> 00:23:59,245
Oh, my god!

407
00:23:59,378 --> 00:24:02,716
Welcome to the garden
of Weeden, motherfucker!

408
00:24:02,848 --> 00:24:07,185
- Ta da!
- We found it! I told you!

409
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:10,556
I think I've seen bigger
plants than this in Afghanistan.

410
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,725
Dude, you see all these other plants?

411
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:15,228
Fuck them. It's about this one, right here.

412
00:24:15,361 --> 00:24:16,929
This is the queen bee,

413
00:24:17,062 --> 00:24:20,833
the mother of all marijuana
plants on planet Earth.

414
00:24:20,967 --> 00:24:22,669
They say she was seeded from outer space,

415
00:24:22,802 --> 00:24:25,171
and sent to us by some
extraterrestrial intelligence,

416
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:27,105
to help us find our way back.

417
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:29,174
Wow, man. Back from what?

418
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:32,812
Well, fuck if I know! I
just came to smoke this shit!

419
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:34,748
Oh, my god!

420
00:24:37,016 --> 00:24:39,985
Whoa, brother. Jesus, chill out, man.

421
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,454
What?

422
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:43,256
You're being an asshole
to that plant right now.

423
00:24:44,723 --> 00:24:46,091
You know what? You're right.

424
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:48,127
- Chill.
- [Tim] Alright.

425
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,396
You're right. I'm being kind
of an asshole to this plant.

426
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,264
I need to step aside for a minute,

427
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:55,834
center myself, come back,

428
00:24:55,969 --> 00:25:00,273
snip some buds, and proceed
to get fucking baked.

429
00:25:01,574 --> 00:25:03,709
(whispering) Awesome.

430
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:05,545
[Martha] You don't think
he's addicted, do you?

431
00:25:05,678 --> 00:25:06,746
Him?

432
00:25:08,146 --> 00:25:10,282
No, he's always been like that.

433
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:14,788
First guy in high school to
tap a keg, unsnap a bra...

434
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:16,655
(laughing)

435
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:18,458
Dude's a legend.

436
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:20,893
Well, speaking of legends,

437
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:22,694
I've heard a lot about you, James.

438
00:25:22,827 --> 00:25:24,129
[James] Yeah?

439
00:25:24,263 --> 00:25:25,898
Yeah, I wasn't sure if
we'd hit it off at first.

440
00:25:26,032 --> 00:25:28,301
But you know, so far so good.

441
00:25:31,304 --> 00:25:35,374
(laughs awkwardly) Look, Tim's my bro.

442
00:25:35,507 --> 00:25:36,741
[Martha] Yeah.

443
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:40,613
I just wanted to thank
you for your services.

444
00:25:41,948 --> 00:25:42,815
Okay.

445
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,471
(cracking)

446
00:26:06,604 --> 00:26:11,611
(ominous music)

447
00:26:16,915 --> 00:26:17,816
(crunching)

448
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:21,488
Tim?

449
00:26:29,327 --> 00:26:31,062
[Tim] Alright, this is ready.

450
00:26:31,197 --> 00:26:33,332
Who's ready to blast off?

451
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,867
[Martha] Oh, me, me, me.

452
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,336
[Tim] Oh, you know, before
we commence this ceremony,

453
00:26:37,469 --> 00:26:38,836
we should say like a
little prayer, you know?

454
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,838
Kind of get into it.

455
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:41,206
[Martha] Out loud, or what?

456
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,676
[Tim] Whatever you feel comfortable with.

457
00:26:45,678 --> 00:26:46,911
(Tim chanting)

458
00:26:47,046 --> 00:26:48,213
Roll, roll, roll the joint.

459
00:26:48,346 --> 00:26:51,016
Twist it at the ends.

460
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,686
Take a puff and that's enough,

461
00:26:53,818 --> 00:26:57,022
now pass it to your friends.

462
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:01,560
Man, what kind of eastern
bullshit you been studying?

463
00:27:01,693 --> 00:27:03,495
Well, have you ever heard of Tantra?

464
00:27:05,197 --> 00:27:06,866
No.

465
00:27:06,998 --> 00:27:08,735
Cause he has, and it's divine.

466
00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:11,636
It's an ancient Vedic
sexual ecstasy practice.

467
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:12,805
No big deal.

468
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:14,006
No big deal?

469
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,641
I'd say marathon love-making sessions,

470
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:17,442
ending in multiple female ejaculation,

471
00:27:17,576 --> 00:27:19,844
(choking) is kind of a big deal.

472
00:27:19,978 --> 00:27:22,114
Jesus, fuck, calm down.

473
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:31,557
[Tim] That's it.

474
00:27:33,057 --> 00:27:34,861
[James] I can't.

475
00:27:34,994 --> 00:27:37,297
[Tim] Dude, this leaves
no trace in your system.

476
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,502
[James] Okay.

477
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:01,521
(coughing)

478
00:28:01,653 --> 00:28:03,489
(laughing)

479
00:28:04,856 --> 00:28:06,258
[Martha] Oh, my god.

480
00:28:07,293 --> 00:28:12,364
(electronica)

481
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,248
[James] Guys, I can't move.

482
00:28:30,516 --> 00:28:32,885
I can't move, guys.

483
00:28:33,018 --> 00:28:33,920
Did I ever tell you that I used to be

484
00:28:34,053 --> 00:28:35,854
Jim Morrison in a past life?

485
00:28:49,035 --> 00:28:50,637
I'm so hot.

486
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,305
I make fire jealous.

487
00:28:54,506 --> 00:28:55,374
Right?

488
00:28:58,209 --> 00:28:59,245
[Tim] Baby, look at me.

489
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:00,947
I haven't danced like this since 69.

490
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,415
You look like you're
having a fucking seizure.

491
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:04,950
You're not Jim Morrison.

492
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:16,763
Tim, you're gonna fall in the fire.

493
00:29:18,064 --> 00:29:19,098
[Tim] What'd you say?

494
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,933
You want me to light your fire?

495
00:29:23,201 --> 00:29:26,905
(explosions)

496
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:30,776
Do you think I'm pretty?

497
00:29:35,748 --> 00:29:36,915
Yo...

498
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:40,086
Your...

499
00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:47,192
(speaking gibberish)

500
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:51,796
That is the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

501
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,233
Tim's too busy jerking
off, to Asian fairy porn,

502
00:29:54,365 --> 00:29:56,235
to notice me anymore.

503
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:58,937
Do you like Asian fairy porn?

504
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:08,046
(electronica)

505
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,449
Of course you do.

506
00:30:18,289 --> 00:30:19,491
All men do.

507
00:30:38,376 --> 00:30:39,578
Tim...

508
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:42,414
Tim, you're gonna fall in the fire.

509
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,055
(thudding)

510
00:30:51,556 --> 00:30:54,661
What in the fuck just happened?

511
00:30:54,794 --> 00:30:55,928
Threw some sticks on the fire, homie.

512
00:30:56,061 --> 00:30:57,330
You feeling it?

513
00:30:59,797 --> 00:31:00,666
[James] What?

514
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:03,201
Here, hit this.

515
00:31:03,334 --> 00:31:04,870
[James] No, fuck no.

516
00:31:05,004 --> 00:31:06,439
[Tim] All right, suit yourself.

517
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:12,978
Did you guys kill anyone
when you were in Afghanistan?

518
00:31:13,112 --> 00:31:15,014
[Tim] Why you gotta go bringing
everyone down like that?

519
00:31:15,146 --> 00:31:16,480
You're on a crazy train right now,

520
00:31:16,614 --> 00:31:17,450
and it's time to get off.

521
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:18,650
I'm sorry.

522
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,584
[Tim] I know you're high right now,

523
00:31:19,718 --> 00:31:20,620
but you need to stop.

524
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,588
I'm sorry, war makes me laugh.

525
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:26,526
Maybe this is enough for one night.

526
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:30,696
Did you see that?

527
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,797
[Tim] The shooting star?

528
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,032
[James] Yeah.

529
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:35,834
(zapping)

530
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:37,569
[Tim] Whoa! What the hell?

531
00:31:37,702 --> 00:31:38,269
Jesus.

532
00:31:38,402 --> 00:31:40,639
Oh, dude!

533
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:42,374
They don't call this star leaf for nothing.

534
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:44,876
Full-on visuals!

535
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:47,378
Wait, where do stars come from, anyway?

536
00:31:47,513 --> 00:31:48,647
Same place we do.

537
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,415
Everything's star dust, baby.

538
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:52,651
(laughing)

539
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,151
(man yelling) (suspenseful music)

540
00:31:54,286 --> 00:31:55,921
Fuck. Do you hear that?

541
00:31:59,525 --> 00:32:01,127
This weed is getting trippy.

542
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:02,460
Maybe we should all just get up,

543
00:32:02,594 --> 00:32:04,028
and like walk around.

544
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:05,930
[James] No, dude. I fucking
heard something out there.

545
00:32:06,064 --> 00:32:07,200
[Tim] Really?

546
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:10,135
(snapping)

547
00:32:10,268 --> 00:32:11,170
Shit, there's movement out there!

548
00:32:11,303 --> 00:32:13,406
Dude, sit down.

549
00:32:13,538 --> 00:32:15,173
It's just voices in your head, alright?

550
00:32:15,306 --> 00:32:16,508
I'm fucking telling you, man.

551
00:32:16,642 --> 00:32:18,643
I heard somebody talking
out there, in Pashto.

552
00:32:18,777 --> 00:32:19,812
What the hell is Pashto?

553
00:32:19,944 --> 00:32:21,146
[James] It's an Afghan dialect.

554
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,480
It's just voices in your head, alright?

555
00:32:22,613 --> 00:32:23,815
They get louder when there's no

556
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,217
city noise to drown them out.

557
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:26,118
He's right.

558
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:27,818
(dramatic music)

559
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:29,187
[James] What the hell?

560
00:32:30,622 --> 00:32:32,925
City noise does tend to drown out a lot.

561
00:32:33,057 --> 00:32:34,227
Doesn't it?

562
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:39,832
Unfortunately, city people,

563
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:41,734
such as yourselves, make so much noise,

564
00:32:41,866 --> 00:32:44,435
you can hear them miles
away, in the dead of night.

565
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:47,539
Talking about the secrets of the universe,

566
00:32:47,672 --> 00:32:49,342
and all kinds of interesting stuff,

567
00:32:49,475 --> 00:32:53,346
people like to talk
about when they're high.

568
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,547
Hmm?

569
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:59,519
Oh, look at that.

570
00:33:10,296 --> 00:33:11,497
Mmm.

571
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:17,869
It is legal now.

572
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:19,971
No prescription necessary.

573
00:33:21,573 --> 00:33:24,043
I'm sorry, old habits die hard.

574
00:33:25,477 --> 00:33:26,945
[Tim] Officer?

575
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:28,746
[Ranger] Forrest ranger.

576
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,718
I'm just out making my rounds.

577
00:33:32,851 --> 00:33:36,122
Walking the trails with
the snakes and the snails.

578
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:39,592
Checking the pines for
those evergreen crimes.

579
00:33:40,325 --> 00:33:42,094
Hmm?

580
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,629
We found some evergreen, alright.

581
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:46,131
(whispering)

582
00:33:46,265 --> 00:33:47,833
[Ranger] That you did, honey.

583
00:33:47,967 --> 00:33:49,569
That you did.

584
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:52,605
Here you go.

585
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:54,707
- Thank you.
- [Ranger] Yeah.

586
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,276
You folks mind if I take a knee?

587
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,644
[Tim] Please.

588
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:04,183
Have a seat, son.

589
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:06,651
Fire's getting cold.

590
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:10,422
Well, look at that.

591
00:34:10,555 --> 00:34:12,390
Marshmallows and everything.

592
00:34:14,058 --> 00:34:18,964
Wow, you kids sure know how
to enjoy the great outdoors.

593
00:34:19,832 --> 00:34:21,366
I'll give you that.

594
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,668
[James] So, is this place something that

595
00:34:22,801 --> 00:34:26,138
you and the other forest
rangers know about?

596
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,674
[Ranger] We've been coming
here a long time, son.

597
00:34:28,806 --> 00:34:31,710
Oh, you mean like the
indigenous first peoples?

598
00:34:32,678 --> 00:34:34,080
I'm talking about everyone.

599
00:34:35,147 --> 00:34:36,282
From everywhere.

600
00:34:37,482 --> 00:34:42,488
(mysterious music)

601
00:34:48,093 --> 00:34:50,696
Do you see a lot of wildlife?

602
00:34:54,966 --> 00:34:56,701
I saw a moose fucking a bear once.

603
00:34:56,835 --> 00:34:57,870
(laughing)

604
00:34:58,004 --> 00:35:00,404
[Martha] Wait, you saw what?

605
00:35:00,538 --> 00:35:03,142
Moose, fucking a bear.

606
00:35:03,274 --> 00:35:04,308
(laughter)

607
00:35:04,442 --> 00:35:05,945
[James] No, man.

608
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,947
What, are you telling me you've never

609
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,948
seen something strange before?

610
00:35:11,082 --> 00:35:12,850
(suspenseful music)

611
00:35:12,984 --> 00:35:15,621
Something only you, and
no one else could see?

612
00:35:16,488 --> 00:35:17,390
Hmm?

613
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:21,326
You folks wanna get high?

614
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,861
- Yeah.
- [Tim] Yeah.

615
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:27,065
Well, you can certainly get high, right?

616
00:35:32,002 --> 00:35:36,975
(inhaling deeply)

617
00:35:51,056 --> 00:35:52,558
Whoa.

618
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,227
It's not how high you go that matters.

619
00:35:55,259 --> 00:35:57,062
It's where you go.

620
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,964
Ah, I like the way you think, officer.

621
00:35:59,096 --> 00:36:00,232
- [Ranger] Ranger.
- Ranger...

622
00:36:00,364 --> 00:36:01,033
[Ranger] Ranger.

623
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:01,866
Ranger.

624
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,069
[Ranger] Ranger Dave.

625
00:36:04,169 --> 00:36:05,071
All right, well...

626
00:36:06,171 --> 00:36:08,040
You folks have a good night.

627
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:11,009
And enjoy the great outdoors.

628
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:19,518
(laughing) What the fuck was that?

629
00:36:19,652 --> 00:36:21,453
Did that really just happen?

630
00:36:21,587 --> 00:36:24,323
[Tim] I have no idea what
the dude was talking about.

631
00:36:24,457 --> 00:36:25,591
[Martha] Do you think he was

632
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,460
lying about a moose fucking a bear?

633
00:36:27,593 --> 00:36:29,428
I don't know, with the
weed we've been smoking,

634
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,328
I'd kinda believe him. (laughing)

635
00:36:31,462 --> 00:36:32,797
[Martha] Oh, man.

636
00:36:32,931 --> 00:36:35,767
Man, I don't even think
he was real, though.

637
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:37,536
Yeah, man, he was real.

638
00:36:39,738 --> 00:36:42,207
[Martha] Okay, I'm going to bed.

639
00:36:42,341 --> 00:36:43,842
[Tim] You know what? I'm gonna follow you.

640
00:36:43,975 --> 00:36:46,411
I don't want any close
encounters of the moose-rape kind.

641
00:36:46,544 --> 00:36:48,379
[Martha] Ooh, I actually
wouldn't mind seeing that.

642
00:36:48,513 --> 00:36:49,714
Well, get in that tent,

643
00:36:49,848 --> 00:36:51,217
and I'll show you what
a moose dick looks like.

644
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,752
(laughing)

645
00:36:53,718 --> 00:36:54,585
[Martha] Let me in first.

646
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,087
[Tim] No! (laughing)

647
00:37:07,665 --> 00:37:12,738
(ominous music)

648
00:38:17,703 --> 00:38:20,038
They'll be coming for you, James.

649
00:38:21,372 --> 00:38:23,475
They've have their eye on you a long time.

650
00:38:24,776 --> 00:38:26,145
Long time...

651
00:38:27,645 --> 00:38:29,080
But you already knew that.

652
00:38:31,382 --> 00:38:33,785
Didn't you? Hmm?

653
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,977
Careful where you're going, now.

654
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:00,745
You never know what you might find.

655
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:02,114
Who the fuck are you?

656
00:39:02,247 --> 00:39:04,315
Stay the fuck away from my friends!

657
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:09,454
(dramatic music)

658
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,533
Get up, goddamn it! We've got hostiles!

659
00:39:24,703 --> 00:39:25,603
Shit.

660
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,539
[Martha] James!

661
00:39:37,948 --> 00:39:38,850
[James] Martha?

662
00:39:40,317 --> 00:39:42,153
What are you doing out here?

663
00:39:42,288 --> 00:39:44,490
Waiting for you to find me.

664
00:39:44,622 --> 00:39:47,892
We have to go back to the camp.

665
00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:49,560
Where's Tim?

666
00:39:49,694 --> 00:39:51,396
The plant can help you, James.

667
00:39:51,529 --> 00:39:52,830
What?

668
00:39:52,964 --> 00:39:54,333
It's a portal, don't you see?

669
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,435
To the stars.

670
00:39:58,036 --> 00:39:59,404
What are you talking about?

671
00:40:00,906 --> 00:40:02,208
Where are your clothes?

672
00:40:04,509 --> 00:40:06,011
These can't help you.

673
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:10,548
Share your pain with me, James.

674
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:13,951
No, I don't need saving.

675
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:15,120
Come here.

676
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:32,238
(suspenseful music)

677
00:40:37,207 --> 00:40:37,910
Fuck!

678
00:40:41,812 --> 00:40:46,818
(slow music)

679
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,165
(birds chirping)

680
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,279
[Martha] Tim?

681
00:41:14,413 --> 00:41:15,781
Tim?

682
00:41:19,984 --> 00:41:23,087
[Tim] What? How the
hell did we get out here?

683
00:41:24,388 --> 00:41:26,490
[Martha] I don't know.

684
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:27,660
We must've been higher than we thought.

685
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:29,426
(laughing)

686
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,828
Yeah.

687
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:35,100
Where's James?

688
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:39,772
Probably smart enough to
sleep in his own tent. I guess.

689
00:41:39,904 --> 00:41:41,272
(laughing)

690
00:41:42,207 --> 00:41:44,609
[Tim] Well, we better check.

691
00:41:48,614 --> 00:41:50,015
Wait a sec.

692
00:41:55,085 --> 00:41:58,689
Ooh, now this is the
bulging wood I came to see.

693
00:41:58,823 --> 00:42:01,125
[Tim] Top of the morning to you, too.

694
00:42:01,259 --> 00:42:03,429
Morning glory, or whatever it is.

695
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,408
Tim? Martha?

696
00:42:34,024 --> 00:42:35,059
(screaming)

697
00:42:36,395 --> 00:42:37,862
- [Martha] Shit!
- What?

698
00:42:37,995 --> 00:42:39,096
[Martha] Get down. Get down.

699
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,299
[James] What the hell is going on?

700
00:42:40,431 --> 00:42:41,700
What are you guys doing out here?

701
00:42:41,832 --> 00:42:42,533
[Martha] There's
something behind that tree.

702
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:43,701
It was watching us.

703
00:42:43,835 --> 00:42:45,304
What the fuck you talking about?

704
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:46,603
[Martha] The fucking tree,
right there, was watching us.

705
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:48,006
Please go check it out.

706
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:50,542
No, to your left!

707
00:42:50,674 --> 00:42:51,408
[James] Here?

708
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:52,443
[Martha] The big one!

709
00:42:56,381 --> 00:42:57,482
[Tim] Do you see anything?

710
00:42:58,884 --> 00:43:00,352
Nothing!

711
00:43:00,486 --> 00:43:01,620
Maybe it was just that moose fucking.

712
00:43:01,754 --> 00:43:03,755
[Martha] It wasn't a fucking moose.

713
00:43:03,888 --> 00:43:05,923
It wasn't a fucking moose.

714
00:43:07,357 --> 00:43:08,626
Fuck this, man.

715
00:43:08,761 --> 00:43:11,697
Okay, give me my shirt, I'm leaving.

716
00:43:17,368 --> 00:43:19,071
(dramatic music)

717
00:43:27,145 --> 00:43:30,882
(eerie hissing)

718
00:43:33,484 --> 00:43:35,386
(dramatic music)

719
00:43:43,828 --> 00:43:45,330
[James] Hurry up! We gotta go!

720
00:43:45,462 --> 00:43:46,330
[Tim] What, did you see something?

721
00:43:46,464 --> 00:43:47,265
[James] I said we gotta go!

722
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:48,767
Leave the fucking tents!

723
00:43:49,901 --> 00:43:51,036
I said leave them, come on!

724
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:52,603
- [Martha] Coming.
- [Tim] All right!

725
00:44:21,366 --> 00:44:23,936
I don't know. We're
probably all just still high.

726
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:25,170
[Martha] No, I know what I saw.

727
00:44:25,303 --> 00:44:26,738
You saw the lights last night too?

728
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,738
- No.
- [Tim] Yeah, dude.

729
00:44:27,872 --> 00:44:29,006
We all saw the shooting star.

730
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,675
I'm not talking about the shooting star.

731
00:44:30,808 --> 00:44:32,009
[Tim] What the hell are
you talking about then?

732
00:44:32,143 --> 00:44:33,345
[James] That blinding light that...

733
00:44:33,477 --> 00:44:35,346
[Tim] Fuck! Whoa! What the fuck is that?

734
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,615
- Jesus!
- Just go man!

735
00:44:36,748 --> 00:44:37,882
- [Martha] Go!
- [James] Just go!

736
00:44:38,982 --> 00:44:41,051
Holy fucking shit!

737
00:44:41,185 --> 00:44:42,721
What the fuck is that, man?

738
00:44:42,853 --> 00:44:43,622
(Martha yelling)

739
00:44:44,756 --> 00:44:45,790
[Tim] Calm down.

740
00:44:45,924 --> 00:44:48,393
[Martha] Get off! Run her over!

741
00:44:48,527 --> 00:44:49,461
Honk the horn!

742
00:44:49,593 --> 00:44:50,728
(screaming) (honking horn)

743
00:44:50,863 --> 00:44:52,330
It's some kind of animal or something!

744
00:44:52,462 --> 00:44:53,131
- [James] Go, motherfucker go!
- [Martha] Just run it over!

745
00:44:53,263 --> 00:44:53,964
[James] Just go!

746
00:44:54,098 --> 00:44:58,903
(suspenseful music)

747
00:45:00,872 --> 00:45:01,772
[Martha] Just go around.

748
00:45:01,906 --> 00:45:03,007
Babe, we're in a Prius.

749
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,475
It's not built for off-road activity.

750
00:45:07,846 --> 00:45:09,080
What are you doing?

751
00:45:09,214 --> 00:45:10,949
We must've missed an
off-road or something.

752
00:45:12,283 --> 00:45:13,484
- Shit!
- [Tim] Holy shit.

753
00:45:16,486 --> 00:45:17,788
It's an ambush.

754
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:19,357
What the fuck are you
talking about, an ambush?

755
00:45:19,491 --> 00:45:20,592
We're in a kill-zone.

756
00:45:20,725 --> 00:45:21,491
A what zone?

757
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:22,761
A kill-zone!

758
00:45:27,966 --> 00:45:29,668
Grab your packs, hurry!

759
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:33,671
- (knocking)
- [Martha] Fuck.

760
00:45:33,805 --> 00:45:34,839
- Shit...
- Come on, let's go!

761
00:45:34,971 --> 00:45:36,575
Come on! Come on!

762
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:39,276
[Martha] What the hell is going on?

763
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:40,578
[Tim] Some kind of ambush.

764
00:45:40,712 --> 00:45:41,913
Who would be ambushing us?

765
00:45:42,046 --> 00:45:43,214
[Tim] Just get your shit.

766
00:45:43,348 --> 00:45:45,049
[James] What the fuck is the holdup, man?

767
00:45:45,183 --> 00:45:46,351
Come on!

768
00:45:47,352 --> 00:45:48,987
What the hell is that?

769
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,489
[Tim] Grab that shit and let's go!

770
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:51,855
[Martha] What the hell is that?

771
00:45:51,989 --> 00:45:53,024
Is that fucking star leaf?

772
00:45:53,158 --> 00:45:54,359
You have fucking star leaf clippings?

773
00:45:54,493 --> 00:45:56,060
He fucking has star leaf clippings.

774
00:45:56,194 --> 00:45:58,029
You're fucking us over, you realize that?

775
00:45:58,163 --> 00:45:59,364
[James] You guys. You guys.

776
00:45:59,497 --> 00:46:00,297
- Are you serious?
- [Martha] He fucked us over.

777
00:46:00,431 --> 00:46:01,232
[James] Are you serious?

778
00:46:01,366 --> 00:46:02,500
Man, get rid of that shit!

779
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,368
[Tim] Dude, it's not that much, okay?

780
00:46:03,502 --> 00:46:04,670
I just needed a little,

781
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,170
to make some clones
when I got home, alright?

782
00:46:06,303 --> 00:46:08,439
Look, you guys are
freaking out way too much.

783
00:46:08,573 --> 00:46:09,507
We all just need to calm...

784
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,875
- (Tim screaming)
- Whoa, dude!

785
00:46:11,009 --> 00:46:11,876
[Martha] What the fuck?

786
00:46:12,009 --> 00:46:13,377
Tim? Baby? Baby?

787
00:46:13,511 --> 00:46:15,147
[Tim] What the fuck just grabbed me?

788
00:46:16,881 --> 00:46:18,416
[Martha] Baby, are you okay?

789
00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:20,651
Look at me. Let me see. Let me see.

790
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,966
(ominous music)

791
00:46:35,966 --> 00:46:37,802
Tim? Martha?

792
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,781
Okay...

793
00:46:49,913 --> 00:46:52,618
James Hunter, Sergeant,
United States Marine Corps.

794
00:46:53,585 --> 00:46:55,553
I'm here, in Washington state,

795
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:58,123
in the Olympic National Rainforest.

796
00:46:58,256 --> 00:46:59,656
I know this is gonna sound crazy.

797
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,993
But something really, fucked
up is happening right now.

798
00:47:02,127 --> 00:47:04,029
And to be honest, I have no idea what.

799
00:47:06,397 --> 00:47:07,431
Fuck.

800
00:47:07,564 --> 00:47:08,767
I know this looks cheesy as hell,

801
00:47:08,899 --> 00:47:10,167
staring down into a camera,

802
00:47:10,301 --> 00:47:12,337
like some bullshit scene
from some horror film.

803
00:47:12,471 --> 00:47:14,907
But I promise you, this is real, okay?

804
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:17,976
In case something happens,

805
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:20,645
hopefully somebody will find this footage,

806
00:47:20,777 --> 00:47:22,647
and try to make some sense out of all this.

807
00:47:28,051 --> 00:47:29,320
It's been an hour.

808
00:47:30,855 --> 00:47:32,557
Still no sign of my friends.

809
00:47:34,259 --> 00:47:36,061
Think I'm gonna head west,

810
00:47:36,194 --> 00:47:39,264
towards the Pacific
ocean, away from the peaks.

811
00:47:39,397 --> 00:47:40,699
Hopefully I'll run into some kind of

812
00:47:40,832 --> 00:47:42,267
fucking civilization out there.

813
00:47:42,399 --> 00:47:44,801
I just have no idea what
the hell I'm doing, still.

814
00:47:44,935 --> 00:47:46,971
But, I don't know, I'm...

815
00:47:47,105 --> 00:47:48,006
(cracking)

816
00:47:48,138 --> 00:47:53,178
(ominous music)

817
00:48:03,955 --> 00:48:08,960
(gunshots)

818
00:48:14,866 --> 00:48:18,070
(gunshots)

819
00:48:21,172 --> 00:48:21,974
Fuck.

820
00:48:25,576 --> 00:48:27,779
(gunshots)

821
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:39,424
(gunshots)

822
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,165
(crunching)

823
00:48:48,299 --> 00:48:50,736
(gunshots)

824
00:49:07,752 --> 00:49:09,121
Lower your weapon.

825
00:49:10,488 --> 00:49:11,723
Lower your weapon.

826
00:49:17,127 --> 00:49:18,462
Now this, my friend...

827
00:49:19,864 --> 00:49:21,499
This is one hell of a violation,

828
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:23,335
of park regulations.

829
00:49:25,335 --> 00:49:28,105
Look, I can put in a good word,

830
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:29,908
about you using this thing here,

831
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,876
considering your current
state of mind and all.

832
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:35,078
But as for them...

833
00:49:35,212 --> 00:49:37,515
They chose to break the
rules, of their own free will.

834
00:49:37,649 --> 00:49:38,783
[James] My friends are dead and you're

835
00:49:38,917 --> 00:49:40,884
talking to me about the fucking rules?

836
00:49:41,018 --> 00:49:43,321
I'll show you some fucking rules!

837
00:49:46,623 --> 00:49:48,091
[Ranger] If you can't
follow a few simple rules,

838
00:49:48,225 --> 00:49:50,027
like not taking photos...

839
00:49:50,995 --> 00:49:52,197
Or as in his case,

840
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:53,799
stealing himself some
souvenirs to take home.

841
00:49:53,931 --> 00:49:55,466
How are we supposed to trust all of you,

842
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,035
with the secrets to the universe, huh?

843
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:59,136
You tell me that.

844
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:00,305
[James] I can't believe I killed them.

845
00:50:00,437 --> 00:50:02,706
Well, let's go check, make sure.

846
00:50:10,348 --> 00:50:12,750
Yeah, they're dead.

847
00:50:14,919 --> 00:50:16,221
You got a permit for this?

848
00:50:18,522 --> 00:50:19,457
I found it.

849
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:21,558
[Ranger] Wow.

850
00:50:21,692 --> 00:50:23,762
I guess it's your lucky day then.

851
00:50:24,928 --> 00:50:26,564
You sure as hell know how to shoot it.

852
00:50:28,065 --> 00:50:29,334
Don't you?

853
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:31,335
Yes.

854
00:50:32,303 --> 00:50:33,105
Louder.

855
00:50:34,372 --> 00:50:36,007
Yes, sir.

856
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,007
(gunshots)

857
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,876
I can't hear you, maggot!

858
00:50:39,009 --> 00:50:40,078
Sir, yes sir!

859
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,111
Sound off like you've got a pair!

860
00:50:41,245 --> 00:50:42,647
Sir, yes sir!

861
00:50:42,779 --> 00:50:44,082
(gunshot)

862
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:56,693
[Tim] James?

863
00:50:56,828 --> 00:50:57,996
Oh, my god. We found you.

864
00:50:58,129 --> 00:51:00,531
[Martha] Who are you yelling at?

865
00:51:00,665 --> 00:51:02,334
What are you doing with that?

866
00:51:08,672 --> 00:51:09,707
I don't believe this.

867
00:51:09,841 --> 00:51:10,842
What?

868
00:51:12,143 --> 00:51:13,177
You're dead.

869
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:14,844
What are you talking about?

870
00:51:14,978 --> 00:51:17,582
I killed you guys.

871
00:51:17,716 --> 00:51:19,584
Dude, that star leaf really messed with us.

872
00:51:19,716 --> 00:51:22,153
We need to just calm down,
find a place to chill.

873
00:51:25,089 --> 00:51:26,357
I'm sorry.

874
00:51:28,692 --> 00:51:29,526
[Tim] About what?

875
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,895
What's he talking about, baby?

876
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,632
We didn't know that there would be a kid.

877
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,203
[Tim] Dude, you're in
Washington state now, okay?

878
00:51:39,335 --> 00:51:41,339
You're safe.

879
00:51:41,471 --> 00:51:43,774
You wanted me to take the
shot so bad, didn't you?

880
00:51:45,576 --> 00:51:46,778
The pink mist...

881
00:51:47,578 --> 00:51:48,680
It's yours.

882
00:51:49,513 --> 00:51:50,781
Take the shot.

883
00:51:53,651 --> 00:51:54,819
Take the shot.

884
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,156
Take the shot!

885
00:51:58,288 --> 00:52:00,091
[Martha] Honey, honey, it's okay.

886
00:52:00,223 --> 00:52:01,926
[James] No! No!

887
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,195
[Tim] James!

888
00:52:11,368 --> 00:52:13,837
My boy's lost it, completely.

889
00:52:13,971 --> 00:52:15,406
[Martha] They told you
not to touch their stuff.

890
00:52:15,538 --> 00:52:16,607
Why'd you do it?

891
00:52:16,741 --> 00:52:18,009
Had I known it would get this crazy,

892
00:52:18,142 --> 00:52:20,145
I never would've looked
for it in the first place.

893
00:52:20,277 --> 00:52:21,846
Hey, when we get back to the car,

894
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,516
don't let me forget to
pick up the clippings.

895
00:52:26,384 --> 00:52:28,719
So I can take them back to the grove.

896
00:52:30,754 --> 00:52:32,089
Look, you're right. This whole thing is...

897
00:52:32,223 --> 00:52:33,791
No, you know what? This
is fucking bullshit.

898
00:52:33,924 --> 00:52:35,292
[Tim] Babe, calm down.

899
00:52:35,426 --> 00:52:36,759
You're just having a bad trip.

900
00:52:36,893 --> 00:52:38,462
Take the beads, they'll give you some

901
00:52:38,596 --> 00:52:40,465
- peace and calm.
- No, fuck your hippy beads!

902
00:52:40,598 --> 00:52:42,533
What's your problem?

903
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:44,669
Look, I'm not the only one
who broke the fucking rules.

904
00:52:44,803 --> 00:52:45,870
[Martha] No, get off me! Get off me!

905
00:52:46,002 --> 00:52:47,071
- Yeah.
- [Martha] Give me that.

906
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,439
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh
- [Martha] No, no, no.

907
00:52:48,573 --> 00:52:50,775
- Give me that!
- Yeah, yeah, I'm the asshole.

908
00:52:50,908 --> 00:52:53,076
I've seen the way you look at James.

909
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,946
I'm not a slut.

910
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,514
Fuck him. Who gives a shit anyway?

911
00:52:56,647 --> 00:52:59,150
What the fuck was he talking
about back there, huh?

912
00:52:59,283 --> 00:53:00,984
The pink mist?

913
00:53:01,118 --> 00:53:04,622
What's the big fucking
secret, huh? Tell me.

914
00:53:05,189 --> 00:53:06,223
Tell me.

915
00:53:06,357 --> 00:53:07,658
What'd you fucking do back there?

916
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:09,459
What did you do back there?

917
00:53:09,593 --> 00:53:12,096
You fucking killed someone?

918
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,033
You fucking killed someone,
is that what you did?

919
00:53:15,165 --> 00:53:16,801
You're a fucking coward,
hiding behind a plant.

920
00:53:16,933 --> 00:53:18,435
Yeah, who the fuck do you think you are?

921
00:53:18,569 --> 00:53:20,036
Ugh! God!

922
00:53:20,171 --> 00:53:22,073
When we were out, risking
our lives for our country,

923
00:53:22,205 --> 00:53:24,209
you were here fucking every guy in town.

924
00:53:25,009 --> 00:53:26,277
(Martha gasping)

925
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,312
[Martha] Ah, shit!

926
00:53:29,879 --> 00:53:31,682
We are friends.

927
00:53:32,884 --> 00:53:34,352
We're friends.

928
00:53:38,756 --> 00:53:40,125
Oh, yeah? You like my beads?

929
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:43,527
Maybe she can help us
find a way out of here.

930
00:53:45,663 --> 00:53:46,965
Hey...

931
00:53:47,765 --> 00:53:49,067
We need some help, yo.

932
00:53:58,875 --> 00:54:01,645
(Martha crying)

933
00:54:17,094 --> 00:54:17,995
[Tim] Fuck!

934
00:54:18,596 --> 00:54:19,196
[Martha] Tim!

935
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:20,331
Fuck! Oh, god.

936
00:54:20,464 --> 00:54:22,198
Oh, my god. No, no, no.

937
00:54:22,332 --> 00:54:23,434
Tim!

938
00:54:27,772 --> 00:54:29,107
[Seth] Forget something?

939
00:54:29,774 --> 00:54:30,875
[Tim] Shit.

940
00:54:32,243 --> 00:54:33,744
You disappoint me, man.

941
00:54:33,877 --> 00:54:35,546
[Tim] No, no, no. You're not real.

942
00:54:35,678 --> 00:54:37,748
[Seth] Oh, I'm real.

943
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:40,249
And it's about to get really real.

944
00:54:40,384 --> 00:54:42,753
No, no. You don't exist.

945
00:54:42,886 --> 00:54:45,189
You're not real. This is my brain on drugs.

946
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,825
[Seth] Yeah, you're tripping,
man. You're tripping.

947
00:54:47,957 --> 00:54:50,794
And it's a trip straight to hell.

948
00:54:50,928 --> 00:54:52,296
You're just a figment of our imagination,

949
00:54:52,428 --> 00:54:53,897
our collective imagination.

950
00:54:54,031 --> 00:54:54,732
You don't exist.

951
00:54:54,866 --> 00:54:56,201
You disappoint me.

952
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,301
Go away!

953
00:54:59,136 --> 00:55:00,171
Boo.

954
00:55:01,872 --> 00:55:03,140
Boo.

955
00:55:11,582 --> 00:55:13,084
[Martha] What the fuck?

956
00:55:26,129 --> 00:55:27,864
What is this place?

957
00:55:27,997 --> 00:55:29,166
Where the fuck are we?

958
00:55:44,114 --> 00:55:45,750
Did you write that?

959
00:55:48,785 --> 00:55:50,587
(snapping)

960
00:55:57,761 --> 00:56:00,597
This is my stuff. Where'd
you get this stuff, huh?

961
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,067
This is my fucking sunglasses, my phone...

962
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,701
Where'd you get this?

963
00:56:10,473 --> 00:56:11,975
Oh, my god!

964
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:20,418
(suspenseful music)

965
00:56:25,756 --> 00:56:26,991
(screaming)

966
00:56:28,524 --> 00:56:29,827
(screaming)

967
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:34,966
(screaming)

968
00:56:47,511 --> 00:56:49,547
(dramatic music)

969
00:56:54,884 --> 00:56:58,122
(screaming)

970
00:57:04,227 --> 00:57:05,195
Thank god.

971
00:57:07,564 --> 00:57:08,332
Fuck.

972
00:57:12,169 --> 00:57:13,203
Yes...

973
00:57:17,006 --> 00:57:22,012
(ominous music)

974
00:57:41,198 --> 00:57:44,067
(yelling) (screaming)

975
00:57:47,703 --> 00:57:52,709
(peaceful music)

976
00:58:55,739 --> 00:58:57,108
What the fuck are you doing here?

977
00:58:57,241 --> 00:58:59,977
Oh, just checking things out.

978
00:59:00,111 --> 00:59:02,647
I hear you got yourself in a bit of a jam.

979
00:59:04,181 --> 00:59:05,583
Nice to see you're working it out.

980
00:59:05,716 --> 00:59:08,618
I'm telling you, my friend
is a fucking idiot, okay?

981
00:59:08,752 --> 00:59:09,887
He didn't mean to take anything...

982
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,821
Oh, he took it. He took it, alright.

983
00:59:11,955 --> 00:59:13,357
And I'm afraid he meant to.

984
00:59:13,491 --> 00:59:14,625
I'm telling you, man.

985
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:15,626
He didn't mean to do any...

986
00:59:15,759 --> 00:59:17,694
You see this leaf?

987
00:59:17,828 --> 00:59:19,096
Most people think it's only job

988
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:21,498
is to make them feel good.

989
00:59:21,631 --> 00:59:23,867
But feeling good really
isn't what they want.

990
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,437
What they want, this plant can't give them.

991
00:59:27,571 --> 00:59:28,906
Well, what's that?

992
00:59:29,038 --> 00:59:31,741
(ominous music)

993
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:33,311
What's troubling you, man?

994
00:59:34,611 --> 00:59:36,080
Excuse me?

995
00:59:37,381 --> 00:59:39,783
What happened to you,
over there in Afghanistan?

996
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:50,127
(gunshots)

997
00:59:51,761 --> 00:59:53,830
You saw something else
over there, didn't you?

998
00:59:54,931 --> 00:59:56,901
Same thing you saw at my place.

999
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:01,372
(grinding)

1000
01:00:03,006 --> 01:00:04,441
Do you know what it means?

1001
01:00:07,643 --> 01:00:09,879
It's a doorway.

1002
01:00:10,013 --> 01:00:12,149
Closed on one side, open on the other.

1003
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,753
But our plant friends, you see...

1004
01:00:18,055 --> 01:00:18,922
They can only show you the door.

1005
01:00:19,056 --> 01:00:20,524
They can't walk you through it.

1006
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,926
So what about those things we keep seeing?

1007
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:23,994
Well, they're no friends of mine.

1008
01:00:24,127 --> 01:00:26,029
I'll tell you that.

1009
01:00:26,163 --> 01:00:28,598
They're more of a nuisance, really.

1010
01:00:28,732 --> 01:00:30,434
Well, what do they want?

1011
01:00:30,567 --> 01:00:34,137
Man, your karma is like a magnet.

1012
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,705
They're drawn to it.

1013
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,343
Like vultures, in the night, waiting.

1014
01:00:40,343 --> 01:00:41,644
Waiting for what?

1015
01:00:41,777 --> 01:00:43,580
To feed of your conflict.

1016
01:00:43,714 --> 01:00:45,750
They use you to form these

1017
01:00:46,716 --> 01:00:48,785
charged emotional patterns,

1018
01:00:48,919 --> 01:00:51,087
so they can share in a kind
of awareness fulfillment,

1019
01:00:51,221 --> 01:00:53,091
that they're otherwise denied.

1020
01:00:55,426 --> 01:00:58,629
What? What the fuck are you talking about?

1021
01:01:00,529 --> 01:01:02,198
(dramatic music)

1022
01:01:02,332 --> 01:01:03,600
No...

1023
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:05,602
Go on! Get out of here!

1024
01:01:05,736 --> 01:01:06,569
(dramatic music)

1025
01:01:06,703 --> 01:01:08,005
Go back to where you came from!

1026
01:01:08,138 --> 01:01:09,539
There ain't nothing here for you!

1027
01:01:09,672 --> 01:01:10,707
Go on!

1028
01:01:13,143 --> 01:01:14,011
(growling)

1029
01:01:15,712 --> 01:01:20,718
(speaking unknown language)

1030
01:01:23,252 --> 01:01:24,654
(explosion)

1031
01:01:25,689 --> 01:01:26,957
(speaking unknown language)

1032
01:01:27,089 --> 01:01:28,325
(explosion)

1033
01:01:29,426 --> 01:01:31,161
(speaking unknown language)

1034
01:01:31,294 --> 01:01:32,763
(explosion)

1035
01:01:34,431 --> 01:01:35,699
(speaking unknown language)

1036
01:01:35,832 --> 01:01:37,100
(explosion)

1037
01:01:39,335 --> 01:01:44,040
(speaking unknown language)

1038
01:01:44,174 --> 01:01:47,111
(explosion)

1039
01:01:47,243 --> 01:01:49,913
[Seth] (laughing) Did you see that, man?

1040
01:01:50,047 --> 01:01:51,915
What the fuck did you just say?

1041
01:01:52,049 --> 01:01:54,252
Oh, it's just an old Jewish
nursery rhyme for kids.

1042
01:01:55,285 --> 01:01:56,420
[James] What?

1043
01:01:56,553 --> 01:01:57,587
Yeah, you know, it works in a pinch.

1044
01:01:57,721 --> 01:01:59,189
But it ain't gonna work for long.

1045
01:01:59,323 --> 01:02:00,123
You better get back to your friends.

1046
01:02:00,256 --> 01:02:01,191
They're gonna need you.

1047
01:02:01,325 --> 01:02:02,527
Go on.

1048
01:02:08,364 --> 01:02:09,299
Hell yeah.

1049
01:02:10,968 --> 01:02:12,402
[James] Tim? Martha?

1050
01:02:12,535 --> 01:02:13,903
- [Martha] James?
- [James] What the fuck?

1051
01:02:14,036 --> 01:02:15,439
- [Martha] James, please.
- [Tim] Help us get down.

1052
01:02:15,573 --> 01:02:16,272
- [Martha] Please help us.
- [Tim] Please, before he...

1053
01:02:16,406 --> 01:02:17,408
[Ranger] There he is!

1054
01:02:19,076 --> 01:02:19,977
Been waiting for you.

1055
01:02:20,109 --> 01:02:21,444
Who the hell are you, man?

1056
01:02:21,578 --> 01:02:22,812
What the fuck do you want?

1057
01:02:22,946 --> 01:02:24,382
[Ranger] I tried to warn you.

1058
01:02:24,515 --> 01:02:26,217
Others tried as well.

1059
01:02:27,183 --> 01:02:28,819
The star leaf...

1060
01:02:34,924 --> 01:02:38,763
Well, that's a special leaf, as you know.

1061
01:02:38,895 --> 01:02:40,997
Yeah? What's so special about it, huh?

1062
01:02:41,832 --> 01:02:43,034
It's a star gate.

1063
01:02:44,433 --> 01:02:46,836
It opens up a door to great healing.

1064
01:02:46,969 --> 01:02:50,440
Also great chaos, if
not navigated skillfully.

1065
01:02:50,573 --> 01:02:54,244
Through this door, all
kinds of beings emerge.

1066
01:02:54,377 --> 01:02:56,580
Some good, some not so good.

1067
01:02:56,712 --> 01:02:57,848
(dramatic music)

1068
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,348
[James] Shit.

1069
01:02:59,482 --> 01:03:02,085
(suspenseful music)

1070
01:03:02,218 --> 01:03:05,187
You ever ask yourself if you
really had a choice or not?

1071
01:03:05,321 --> 01:03:07,957
Pulling that trigger? Huh?

1072
01:03:08,091 --> 01:03:09,293
I mean, who's to say?

1073
01:03:09,426 --> 01:03:10,694
I'm just being theoretical.

1074
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:13,631
But who's to say you
happened to save the lives

1075
01:03:13,763 --> 01:03:16,800
of 13 innocent Afghan civilians.

1076
01:03:19,203 --> 01:03:21,005
(honking horn)

1077
01:03:21,138 --> 01:03:21,971
(explosion)

1078
01:03:22,105 --> 01:03:23,241
Just saying.

1079
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,843
(laughing nervously)

1080
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:29,614
(gunshots)

1081
01:03:33,183 --> 01:03:35,518
God, I don't fucking deserve this, okay?

1082
01:03:35,652 --> 01:03:37,788
I don't deserve this! This is bullshit!

1083
01:03:37,921 --> 01:03:39,656
You can save them the
fate of what awaits them.

1084
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:42,192
Put them out of their
misery right now, hmm?

1085
01:03:42,325 --> 01:03:44,895
Untie me, now!

1086
01:03:45,027 --> 01:03:47,497
I just wanted to get a
little high, I'm so sorry.

1087
01:03:47,631 --> 01:03:49,232
[Ranger] Will you just
please shoot his ass already?

1088
01:03:49,366 --> 01:03:50,868
[James] Fuck you.

1089
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,435
Fuck all of you.

1090
01:03:53,402 --> 01:03:55,805
I'm not gonna shoot my friends.

1091
01:03:55,939 --> 01:03:58,109
I'm not shooting my friends! You hear that?

1092
01:03:59,542 --> 01:04:00,576
I really wouldn't test them like that.

1093
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:01,913
And you...

1094
01:04:03,846 --> 01:04:06,750
I've had enough of your fucking bullshit.

1095
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,618
Easy now.

1096
01:04:08,752 --> 01:04:11,054
Fuck easy.

1097
01:04:11,187 --> 01:04:14,624
Why shouldn't I blow your
fucking head off, right now?

1098
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:16,627
Because you're not a murderer, James.

1099
01:04:16,759 --> 01:04:19,062
A killer, maybe.

1100
01:04:20,096 --> 01:04:21,299
But not a murderer.

1101
01:04:22,665 --> 01:04:23,533
What?

1102
01:04:24,835 --> 01:04:26,137
Bad things happen.

1103
01:04:27,136 --> 01:04:29,339
But you're forgiven.

1104
01:04:29,473 --> 01:04:31,342
That's all the plant is trying to tell you.

1105
01:04:32,808 --> 01:04:34,678
It wants to help you, James.

1106
01:04:34,812 --> 01:04:37,314
It does. It really does.

1107
01:04:37,446 --> 01:04:39,749
Help? It wants to help me?

1108
01:04:39,882 --> 01:04:42,151
Is that what it wants? Huh? Huh?

1109
01:04:42,285 --> 01:04:43,886
Is this what you think
is gonna help me? Huh?

1110
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:44,888
[Martha] What the fuck! Seriously?

1111
01:04:45,022 --> 01:04:47,058
[James] How about this? Huh?

1112
01:04:49,225 --> 01:04:50,727
Or maybe this.

1113
01:04:53,029 --> 01:04:55,732
You might wanna think this one through.

1114
01:04:55,866 --> 01:04:57,468
You're making a terrible choice.

1115
01:04:58,468 --> 01:05:00,103
You wanna see it, don't you.

1116
01:05:00,236 --> 01:05:01,372
See what?

1117
01:05:03,506 --> 01:05:05,108
The pink mist.

1118
01:05:05,241 --> 01:05:06,042
(clicking)

1119
01:05:06,176 --> 01:05:07,811
James, no!

1120
01:05:07,944 --> 01:05:09,880
Careful what you wish for.

1121
01:05:10,013 --> 01:05:11,114
You just might find it.

1122
01:05:12,982 --> 01:05:13,783
[Martha] No, James.

1123
01:05:13,917 --> 01:05:14,750
(gunshots)

1124
01:05:14,884 --> 01:05:15,585
[Martha] No!

1125
01:05:15,718 --> 01:05:17,954
(explosion)

1126
01:05:18,087 --> 01:05:23,093
(mysterious music)

1127
01:05:27,931 --> 01:05:31,168
(explosion)

1128
01:05:33,603 --> 01:05:35,004
(Tim laughing)

1129
01:05:35,138 --> 01:05:35,971
[Tim] Dude...

1130
01:05:36,105 --> 01:05:37,341
[James] Where are we?

1131
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:41,578
[Tim] That place I was telling you about.

1132
01:05:45,482 --> 01:05:46,784
Martha?

1133
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:51,788
Tim?

1134
01:05:52,589 --> 01:05:53,857
Yeah?

1135
01:05:58,261 --> 01:05:59,263
You're okay?

1136
01:05:59,395 --> 01:06:00,696
Yeah, are you okay, dude?

1137
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:02,498
We haven't even smoked any weed yet,

1138
01:06:02,631 --> 01:06:04,334
and you're acting like a freak.

1139
01:06:05,402 --> 01:06:07,071
Anyway, dude, like I was saying.

1140
01:06:07,203 --> 01:06:08,504
In this house, there's a
dude that's gonna give us

1141
01:06:08,638 --> 01:06:10,940
a map to the secret grove,
here in the Olympics.

1142
01:06:11,075 --> 01:06:12,609
The stuff is called star leaf.

1143
01:06:12,743 --> 01:06:14,811
It opens a lot of doors
to the supernatural.

1144
01:06:14,944 --> 01:06:16,412
Are you ready? Let's go.

1145
01:06:16,546 --> 01:06:17,515
[James] Wait.

1146
01:06:19,149 --> 01:06:20,750
Dude, how about the kid?

1147
01:06:25,055 --> 01:06:26,556
What? (clearing throat)

1148
01:06:26,689 --> 01:06:28,325
What kid? What are you talking about?

1149
01:06:28,457 --> 01:06:29,926
I know this sounds crazy.

1150
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:31,962
But, you made the right choice that day.

1151
01:06:32,096 --> 01:06:34,197
You made the right call.

1152
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:35,966
Wait, what kid?

1153
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:37,801
Listen, man, I know you're suffering

1154
01:06:37,935 --> 01:06:39,069
from some P.T.S.D. from then.

1155
01:06:39,201 --> 01:06:40,370
But that's why I brought you here.

1156
01:06:40,504 --> 01:06:41,404
We're gonna fix all that.

1157
01:06:41,538 --> 01:06:42,772
[James] Bullshit, man.

1158
01:06:42,906 --> 01:06:45,208
You don't wanna put in
the real fucking work.

1159
01:06:45,341 --> 01:06:46,843
What fucking work?

1160
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:49,279
You saw him too.

1161
01:06:50,379 --> 01:06:51,414
In the spotter's scope.

1162
01:06:51,547 --> 01:06:53,350
It ain't even like that for me.

1163
01:06:53,484 --> 01:06:54,551
[James] I'm not mad at you.

1164
01:06:54,683 --> 01:06:57,020
And I don't blame you for shit.

1165
01:06:57,754 --> 01:06:59,290
I promise.

1166
01:07:08,631 --> 01:07:11,668
You have no idea how badly I
needed to hear that from you.

1167
01:07:12,803 --> 01:07:13,837
[James] Come on, man.

1168
01:07:20,676 --> 01:07:21,611
Shit.

1169
01:07:21,745 --> 01:07:22,880
Oh, god, the federales.

1170
01:07:23,013 --> 01:07:24,181
Let's get in. Come on!

1171
01:07:24,314 --> 01:07:25,147
[Tim] All right, these dudes mess with

1172
01:07:25,281 --> 01:07:26,417
Black people all the time.

1173
01:07:26,549 --> 01:07:28,618
I have a fucking thing that I do.

1174
01:07:28,752 --> 01:07:30,421
Just shut up and listen.

1175
01:07:34,658 --> 01:07:35,526
It's him.

1176
01:07:35,658 --> 01:07:37,660
Who?

1177
01:07:37,794 --> 01:07:39,863
[Ranger] What brings you
fine folks out to these parts?

1178
01:07:39,995 --> 01:07:42,465
[Tim] Oh, I just think
we made a wrong turn.

1179
01:07:42,598 --> 01:07:45,201
[Ranger] You did not make a wrong turn.

1180
01:07:45,335 --> 01:07:47,136
You're exactly where you need to be.

1181
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:48,839
The question is,

1182
01:07:48,971 --> 01:07:51,240
did you or did you not

1183
01:07:51,373 --> 01:07:53,343
come here to purchase marijuana?

1184
01:07:53,477 --> 01:07:54,678
[Martha] Depends.

1185
01:07:54,812 --> 01:07:56,913
You got the sticky icky?

1186
01:07:58,549 --> 01:08:00,483
Well, if the sticky icky
is what you're looking for,

1187
01:08:00,616 --> 01:08:02,819
my friend here, Seth,
would love to help you out.

1188
01:08:05,321 --> 01:08:09,225
Thanks, man, but we're heading out.

1189
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:10,927
Dude.

1190
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:11,894
Let's pull out of here,

1191
01:08:12,027 --> 01:08:13,129
and stick to the original plan,

1192
01:08:13,263 --> 01:08:15,732
hanging out and surfing at the beach.

1193
01:08:16,331 --> 01:08:17,933
The beach?

1194
01:08:18,068 --> 01:08:19,136
You folks heading to La Push?

1195
01:08:19,269 --> 01:08:20,270
[Tim] Yeah, but we've gotta make

1196
01:08:20,403 --> 01:08:21,939
one little stop in Forks first.

1197
01:08:22,072 --> 01:08:24,041
You folks must be Twilight fans then.

1198
01:08:24,174 --> 01:08:26,042
Yeah, well, she thinks people will ask her

1199
01:08:26,175 --> 01:08:27,943
for her autograph cause she kinda looks

1200
01:08:28,077 --> 01:08:29,979
like the chick from the movie.

1201
01:08:30,112 --> 01:08:31,814
Yeah, do you see the resemblance?

1202
01:08:34,517 --> 01:08:37,421
No, not really.

1203
01:08:37,554 --> 01:08:41,056
Then again, I ain't got
much time to watch movies.

1204
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:44,760
Too busy walking the trails
with the snakes and snails.

1205
01:08:44,894 --> 01:08:48,599
Checking the pines for
those evergreen crimes.

1206
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,102
You folks happen to see a wondering moose?

1207
01:08:52,236 --> 01:08:53,671
Looking a little lonely?

1208
01:08:54,837 --> 01:08:56,005
No.

1209
01:08:56,139 --> 01:08:57,574
[Ranger] Well, let me know if you see him.

1210
01:08:57,707 --> 01:09:00,009
[Tim] Gotta go now. It's
nice talking to you, officer.

1211
01:09:02,412 --> 01:09:03,847
Forest ranger...

1212
01:09:04,747 --> 01:09:06,582
Maybe next time, man.

1213
01:09:06,715 --> 01:09:09,319
No worries, bro. All is forgiven.

1214
01:09:12,654 --> 01:09:13,991
All is forgiven.

1215
01:09:16,626 --> 01:09:17,895
Get the fuck out of here, man.

1216
01:09:20,295 --> 01:09:25,268
(slow music)

1217
01:09:37,546 --> 01:09:38,982
Little souvenir for you.

1218
01:09:40,282 --> 01:09:42,752
The kid got his head right, after all.

1219
01:09:43,687 --> 01:09:44,622
That he did.

1220
01:09:45,854 --> 01:09:46,991
That he did.

1221
01:09:52,295 --> 01:09:55,331
(upbeat music)

1222
01:09:55,465 --> 01:09:58,166
[James] God damn, I came all the way back,

1223
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,502
to hang out with you guys,

1224
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:02,673
for shit waves and no sun.

1225
01:10:02,805 --> 01:10:05,776
[Martha] What? It's beautiful!

1226
01:10:05,908 --> 01:10:07,611
This is the high that I came for.

1227
01:10:10,913 --> 01:10:14,084
You telling me that you
didn't already get high today?

1228
01:10:14,218 --> 01:10:15,585
Oh, no, I totally got high today.

1229
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:17,453
But this is the one that I came for.

1230
01:10:17,587 --> 01:10:18,788
[James] You're a fucking idiot, man.

1231
01:10:18,921 --> 01:10:20,556
[Tim] Let's fucking do this, man!

1232
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:21,957
[Martha] Don't go so fast! (laughter)

1233
01:10:22,091 --> 01:10:27,096
(electronica)

1234
01:15:01,104 --> 01:15:04,407
Nice. Yeah that's holding up really well.

1235
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,609
I see you got your 108 little beads there,

1236
01:15:06,742 --> 01:15:08,978
to keep you occupied
while we sort this out.

1237
01:15:09,745 --> 01:15:10,881
One for the one.

1238
01:15:11,014 --> 01:15:12,415
Zero for the nothing.

1239
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:15,085
Eight for infinity.

1240
01:15:15,218 --> 01:15:17,955
Yeah, I guess it feels like
infinity sometimes, don't it?

1241
01:15:18,955 --> 01:15:20,090
Yeah, it's silly. I know.

1242
01:15:20,223 --> 01:15:23,359
But, you know, rules are rules.

1243
01:15:23,492 --> 01:15:25,261
But, I got a good feeling
about that friend of yours.

1244
01:15:26,062 --> 01:15:27,363
Yeah, a good feeling.

1245
01:15:28,497 --> 01:15:32,201
All right, well, shalom, shalom, baby.

1246
