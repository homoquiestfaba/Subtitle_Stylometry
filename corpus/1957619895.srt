01:12:55,772 --> 01:13:00,510
Now, assuming that
we get the authorization act,
I suggest...

1057
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:03,713
a sea based attack
outside the territorial
waters of Syria,

1058
01:13:03,747 --> 01:13:06,650

backed up with
helicopter support.

was caught off guard when
I told him the Achille Lauro 

1068

for his coast.

concrete basis
for thinking

are not acting
in good faith?

1071
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:47,156
We picked up
a radio message
from a Syrian base

1072
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,926
ordering the ship
to head for Tartus.

1073
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:52,962
I told them
they better drop
any such idea.

01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:56,733
Syria cannot go
granting asylum
to those bandits.

1075
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:58,101
Or even allow
the ship to dock.

1076

I'm with
you there.

1077
01:13:59,803 --> 01:14:03,106

be shown toward an action
against the innocent civilians.

we are ready to take
military action

the US citizens
held hostage.

1080
01:14:10,514 --> 01:14:12,549
I hope Italy's position
is equally firm.

I want you
to know,

1082
01:14:14,217 --> 01:14:17,220
if it is decided
that military action
is unavoidable,

1083
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:19,088
the ship is Italian,
remember.

1084
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:21,925
So any action
will be undertaken
by Italy.

1085
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,493
And no one
but Italy.

1086
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:30,133
I want you to be clear
that Italy's first concern

1087
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:32,969
is to avoid the shedding
innocent blood.

from your American colleague.

1101
01:15:10,306 --> 01:15:13,943
Maybe they are hoping
to receive some kind
of assistance or support?

Exactly what is it
you are trying to say?

The hijackers
claim to be
PLO guerrillas.

1104

that some of the more extreme

Their leader?
Abbas. Abu Abbas.

He's on that plane.

2433
02:53:04,575 --> 02:53:06,043
The others simply
followed his plan.

2434
02:53:06,076 --> 02:53:08,011
He was the architect
behind the whole thing.

2435
02:53:08,045 --> 02:53:09,513
He's right there.

Excuse me, General,
but you have sufficient proof
of what your saying?

No, they're building
a file in Washington.

the conversations recorded.

something concrete,

I have no legal justification
foe refusing.

I have no legal grounds
for holding that aircraft,
General.

it has permission to leave.
