4

<i>But with a visual like this,</i>

5

<i>some of it could be</i>
<i>from Walter's pals.</i>

It's been 10 years since I left

<i>But I'm so very tired</i>

72
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:46,510
<i>Maybe it's best</i>
<i>to just sleep on it.</i>

73
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,249
<i>The only problem is...</i>

74
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,419
<i>when I sleep, I remember.</i>

75
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,990
<i>And nothing hurts</i>
<i>quite like that.</i>

76
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,631
<i>When I was a child,</i>

77
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:10,601
<i>the fairy tale</i>
<i>was a wondrous thing,</i>

78
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:13,471
<i>full of magic and hope.</i>

79
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:17,641
<i>But when you grow older,</i>

80
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:20,378
<i>fairy tales are no longer</i>
<i>so wonderful.</i>

81
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,880
<i>They represent foolish dreams,</i>

82
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:24,983
<i>the unreachable.</i>

83
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,020
<i>Like many fairy tales,</i>
<i>our story begins with a king,</i>

84
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,955
<i>a man named Nikolai.</i>

85
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:36,527
<i>There was a girl Nikolai loved</i>
<i>more than life itself:</i>

86
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:38,396
<i>Tatiana.</i>

87
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:42,533
<i>But Nikolai knew there was a darkness
inside that would corrupt her,</i>

88
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:46,937
<i>so he had to leave Tatiana</i>
<i>and his heart behind.</i>

89
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,108
<i>We would not know how</i>
<i>Nikolai became king.</i>

90
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:52,210
<i>We just know he was a king.</i>

91
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:53,677
<i>A ruthless king</i>

92
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:57,615
<i>with his best friend,</i>
<i>the Maharajah, by his side.</i>

93
00:06:57,682 --> 00:07:01,519
<i>The Maharajah had a son he
treasured more than anything,</i>

94
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:03,154
<i>The Rajah.</i>

95
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:07,325
<i>And there was also Sergei,</i>
<i>Nikolai's willful brother.</i>

96
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,959
<i>Reckless and charming,</i>

97
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:11,996
<i>Sergei had desire</i>
<i>and passion aplenty</i>

98
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,333
<i>and a daughter he loved</i>
<i>so very dearly:</i>

99
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,668
<i>Porphyria.</i>

100
00:07:17,736 --> 00:07:20,638
<i>My beautiful princess.</i>

101
00:07:20,705 --> 00:07:24,208
<i>But Sergei also had</i>
<i>envy for his brother,</i>

102
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:26,310
<i>for he had no kingdom.</i>

103
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:29,747
<i>Eventually, this pushed</i>
<i>Nikolai too far.</i>

104
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:31,882
You will leave, Sergei.

105
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:35,153
How dare you.

106
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,723
Breathing or not,
you will leave.

107
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,826
This I will not forgive.

108
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:45,496
<i>A year later...</i>

109

<i>Sergei returned.</i>

111
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:55,039
Of course you remember
Tatiana.

112
00:07:57,943 --> 00:08:01,712
<i>Tatiana could not realize</i>
<i>the storm she was entering.</i>

113
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:08,252
<i>Of course, Nikolai had</i>
<i>never stopped loving her.</i>

114
00:08:09,854 --> 00:08:11,789
<i>She grew troubled.</i>

115
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:16,260
It's never easy loving one man,
let alone two brothers.

116
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:19,029
<i>She went to the Maharaja</i>
<i>for advice.</i>

117
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:22,600
<i>Crazed by her emotions,</i>

118
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:26,036
<i>Tatiana turned to medicines</i>
<i>the Maharaja gave her,</i>

119
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,139
<i>medicines meant to relax.</i>

120
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,141
<i>But instead,</i>
<i>they disoriented her,</i>

121
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,009
<i>allowing other</i>
<i>unscrupulous men</i>

122
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,645
<i>to take advantage</i>
<i>of her confusion.</i>

123
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:39,317
<i>One day, Tatiana discovered</i>
<i>she was pregnant.</i>

124
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,586
It could be yours.

125
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:45,756
It could be Sergei's.
It could be another's.

Another's?

127
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:00,771

<i>When Tatiana, my mother,</i>

133

<i>The ecstasy of the unlikely.</i>

00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:30,788
[chuckles]

177
00:11:30,855 --> 00:11:33,123
Hello, Vassily.

178
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,759
You shouldn't have
come back.

179
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:36,694
You and your boys
brought me back.

180
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,429
He brought me back.

181
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:42,466
Yes, he did,
but something tells me...

182
00:11:42,534 --> 00:11:45,202
you've been asking
to be back, hmm?

183
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,607
Didn't you ever hear the nursery rhyme
about the little boy with the big mouth...

184
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:53,311
and a gun in his chest
and a bullet for every orifice?

185
00:11:53,378 --> 00:11:55,446
Forgive me.

186
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,182
I'm not too good
with the classics.

187
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:06,424
Maybe you were waiting for that
beautiful girl with the dark hair, huh?

188
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:08,091
Tread lightly, Vassily.

189
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,461
The Rajah's
going to kill you,

190
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:15,899
and then I hope I'll be here
for his next trick...

191
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:17,335
when he kills her.

192
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:19,837
<i>I know so many ways</i>
<i>to kill this guy,</i>

193
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:22,005
<i>some of them painless.</i>

194
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:24,041
<i>Unfortunately for him...</i>

195
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:26,844
- [thuds]
- [Vassily screams]

196
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:39,990
Oops.

197
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:46,163
You never should have
mentioned her.

198
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,744
<i>Some of you clever-types might</i>
<i>think this is the kinda story</i>

199
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:02,480
<i>where it all kinda</i>
<i>makes sense in the end.</i>

200
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:04,715
- [explosion]
- [glass shatters]

201
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,484
<i>Wrong.</i>

202
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,694
<i>When Nikolai found</i>
<i>his beloved Tatiana,</i>

203
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,296
<i>he was overcome by</i>
<i>the darkness inside him.</i>

204
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:34,211
<i>Nikolai lost</i>
<i>the love of his life</i>

205
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,748
<i>and his best friend</i>
<i>and brother.</i>

206
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,784
<i>Porphyria would never</i>
<i>see her father again.</i>

207
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:42,019
Why did he leave me?

208
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:44,755
<i>I would never see my mother.</i>

209
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:48,492
<i>Ours was a bond</i>
<i>forged by grief.</i>

210
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,130
<i>Like a good uncle, Nikolai</i>
<i>took the three orphans in,</i>

211
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:57,501
<i>and in his way, grew to love</i>
<i>this boy who was not his own,</i>

212
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:59,637
<i>I think.</i>

213
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:02,606
<i>I was treated differently</i>
<i>because of who I was</i>

214
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:04,207
<i>and who I could be.</i>

215
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:08,479
<i>The Rajah has always blamed me</i>
<i>for the death of his father.</i>

216
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,615
<i>As a boy, he worshipped</i>
<i>the Maharajah.</i>

217
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:12,950
[thud]

218
00:14:13,017 --> 00:14:15,352
<i>And that made it</i>
<i>so very hard to understand</i>

219
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,623
<i>why a man he could not recognize
would kill the Maharajah,</i>

220
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:22,860
<i>especially for who watched</i>
<i>his father bleed to death.</i>

221
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,897
<i>Fortunately, there were</i>
<i>those who cared for me,</i>

222
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:29,633
<i>including men I called</i>
<i>my cousins.</i>

223
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:33,437
<i>Cousin Rogozhin,</i>
<i>the best man.</i>

224
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,173
<i>He taught me about heart</i>
<i>and nobility.</i>

225
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:40,077
<i>The other, Ganya,</i>

226
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:42,947
was a different kind of mentor.

227
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:46,617
<i>A man named Ivan was</i>
<i>a friend to me as well.</i>

228
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,252
You must play for years
before you even realize

229
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,023
what a truly clumsy player
you are.

230
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:54,692
Don't you think, my dear?

231
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:57,495
<i>Ivan also cared for Porphyria.</i>

232
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:04,835
<i>My princess.</i>

233
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:09,373
<i>I loved her.</i>

234
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:13,811
<i>I lived for her.</i>

235
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,616
<i>I always shall.</i>

236
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,689
We have a problem.

237
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:29,660
And that is?

238
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:33,330
As expected, the Rajah
has made his next big move,

239
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:36,199
and it was a stupid one.

240
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:40,303
For some idiotic reason, he had his
men track down your avenging angel.

241
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:42,339
But instead of
killing him then and there,

242
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:45,075
they brought him back so the
Rajah could kill him this time.

243
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,712
And he wasn't too successful.

244
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,517
You'll hate me
for saying this, but...

245
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,587
might be a pity he survived.

246
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,489
The Rajah would have made
his point, had his revenge.

247
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,158
We could negotiate.

248
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:05,930
Now with him back, a catastrophic
situation only gets worse.

249
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,232
Worse?

250
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,268
No.

251
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:15,039
I do believe his return
signals a change for the better.

252
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,842
My dear Porphyria...

253
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,911
must you always take things
with a grain of sugar?

254
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:24,715
With what the Rajah did to us,
our hands are completely tied.

255
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,984
One man, even this man,
won't change that.

256
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,119
He already has, Ivan.

257
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:31,354
We'll see.

258
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:50,574
Area's clear.

259
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,476
Fire's under control.

260
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:56,513
Any signs of him?

261
00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:58,315
A few.

262
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,652
And what of my other men?

263
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,857
Luckily all dead from bullet
wounds before the campfire started.

264
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,259
Except for poor Vassily.

265
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:14,898
He didn't waste any time except
on poor well-done Vassily.

266
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:16,867
An unloaded gun in one hand

267
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:22,039
and a rather disturbing grimace
on what was left of his face.

268
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:25,609
Seems he got a bit emotional
with Vassily.

269
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,077
How disappointing.

270
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,915
You're making a mistake if you
think this is going to be cute.

271
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:33,617
He studied the Good Book.

272
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:37,454
He's learned a few lessons from
the angry Old Testament god.

273
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:40,223
This is a man who's
put away childish things.

274
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:45,195
You should've killed him
when you had the chance.

275
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,337
<i>We grew up...</i>

276
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,609
<i>too quickly.</i>

277
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:04,181
<i>One fateful day,</i>

278
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:07,084
<i>we learned some fairy tales</i>
<i>were written in blood.</i>

279
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:12,690
Porphyria, there is
something I must tell you.

280
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:15,325
I was there when
Nikolai killed your father.

281
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:23,133
<i>This is the world</i>
<i>we were born into.</i>

282
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,573
<i>Nothing would ever</i>
<i>be the same again.</i>

283
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,978
<i>He left Nikolai's house</i>
<i>with Ganya,</i>

284
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:36,947
<i>never to return.</i>

285
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,185
<i>Nobody understood my choice.</i>

286
00:18:41,252 --> 00:18:44,088
<i>Rogozhin felt he had</i>
<i>to stay with Nikolai.</i>

287
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:46,323
<i>He was my hero.</i>

288
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,058
<i>He still is.</i>

289
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:54,598
<i>Like a father,</i>
<i>Nikolai had raised me.</i>

290
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:58,168
<i>And now he would</i>
<i>never forgive me.</i>

291
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,106
I hate
to tell you this...

292
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:03,874
<i>Never one to sit back,</i>

293
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,444
<i>Nikolai told the Rajah</i>
<i>Sergei killed his father</i>

294
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:09,213
<i>with Ganya's help.</i>

295
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:17,320
<i>Insane with anger,</i>
<i>the Rajah condemned us all.</i>

296
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:20,257
[stab]

297
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,830
<i>The Rajah has always bee consumed with
the idea his father would never have died</i>

298
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:29,199
<i>if I never existed.</i>

299
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:30,734
<i>He may be right.</i>

300
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:37,074
<i>My relationship</i>
<i>with Porphyria changed</i>

301
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:40,878
<i>when we were infected</i>
<i>with awareness.</i>

302
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:43,814
<i>There is no greater loss</i>
<i>than innocence.</i>

303
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,154
<i>I dedicated myself to ensuring</i>
<i>nobody threatened her.</i>

304
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:52,289
<i>Then one day...</i>

305
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:55,092
Let there be peace
between us, Porphyria.

306
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,563
<i>...my protection of her</i>
<i>was no longer necessary.</i>

307
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:08,038
<i>Oh, I almost forgot.</i>

308
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,340
<i>Ivan also left Porphyria.</i>

309
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:15,879
<i>And so...</i>

310
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:17,981
<i>I was no longer necessary.</i>

311
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,130
<i>You would think this is the first
time I've seen her in 10 years.</i>

312
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,865
<i>Not true.</i>

313
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,767
<i>I see her every day.</i>

314
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:41,238
<i>Every time I close my eyes.</i>

315
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:45,375
<i>You see, in my own way,</i>

316
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,377
<i>I love this woman</i>
<i>they call Porphyria</i>

317
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:51,381
<i>more than words or images</i>
<i>could ever suggest.</i>

318
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:55,986
<i>As much as I love her,</i>
<i>and I truly do love her,</i>

319
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,455
<i>I hate myself even more.</i>

320
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,302
Gregor, please.

321
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,603
Not the face.

322
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:16,840
As much as I would like
to take the credit,

323
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,708
that's not all my work.

324
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:20,677
Walter's boys
set the table for you.

325
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:25,249
And you relieved Walter and the
boys of the burden of breathing.

326
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:28,418
Something like that.

327
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:32,655
So, 10 years later,
the Tokyo drifter returns.

328
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:35,725
I thought you would've
come back sooner.

329
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:38,962
You know how it is.

330
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:42,332
Yeah, I know.

331
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,471
Come on. There are those
who've been waiting to see you.

332
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,340
- You can walk, right?
- Sure.

333
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:02,085
Special delivery.
Where should I put him?

334
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:03,486
Here.

335
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:06,489
Where did you
find him?

336
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:08,058
Outside that window.

337
00:22:09,193 --> 00:22:11,295
How did he pass
your security?

338
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:18,368
Ivan, get the first-aid kit.

339
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:34,684
You've finally
come back to me.

340
00:22:39,223 --> 00:22:42,092
<i>And after seeing me</i>
<i>somewhat regularly,</i>

341
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,594
<i>a wind generator repairman</i>
<i>once asked...</i>

342
00:22:44,662 --> 00:22:48,665
What particular narcotic did
your mother ingest while pregnant

343
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:51,768
to inspire you
to keep coming out here?

344
00:22:51,836 --> 00:22:54,271
Don't know.

345
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,840
What brought you here?

346
00:22:56,907 --> 00:22:59,876
[coughs]
My health.

347
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:01,811
- Asthma?
- Nah.

348
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:05,415
My wallet and my past
ain't healthy.

349
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:09,652
Desert's cheap and hides
skeletons rather well.

350
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,855
<i>He couldn't see</i>
<i>why I kept returning.</i>

351
00:23:11,922 --> 00:23:13,590
You must be one of those...

352
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:19,896
"find myself through solitude and
adversity in the wilderness" types.

353
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:22,332
Well, that's fuckin' great.

354
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,768
But the only thing you're gonna
find yourself here, Diogenes,

355
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:29,539
is a mean case of heatstroke
and couple of burnt lungs.

356
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,276
The only thing left
is to kill yourself

357
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:36,279
to get out of this
sick, sick heat.

358
00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:40,984
Maybe that's why
I come out here.

359
00:23:51,862 --> 00:23:53,563
[Ivan]
Welcome home.

360
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:01,171
Your legend has grown
quite a bit in your absence.

361
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:06,443
You know that the younger men
refer to you as the Mad Monk?

362
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,248
I believe it
to be an apt choice.

363
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,890
Not so much because of your stubborn
resistance to death and injuries,

364
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:24,961
but because of the unusual, painful methods
you have chosen to express your worship.

365
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:49,386
I see at least two wounds
need stitches.

366
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,254
You're losing
a lot of blood.

367
00:24:52,723 --> 00:24:55,158
I've heard that's
a rather pleasant way to die.

368
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:56,326
Really?

369
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,162
What dead person
told you that?

370
00:25:00,664 --> 00:25:01,931
I'll call our doctor.

371
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:04,267
No.

372
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:06,369
I'll rest now.

373
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:11,708
The bandages don't help,
I'll use duct tape.

374
00:25:11,775 --> 00:25:15,245
You are so ridiculous,
and you need to sleep.

375
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,214
But I don't even want
to let you do that.

376
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:19,983
Do you need me
to go to work now?

377
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,352
No, of course not.

378
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,221
I'm worried about
your head injuries.

379
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:28,358
God has never been
that kind to me.

380
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:30,160
You would like that,
wouldn't you?

381
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:33,597
Slipping away in your sleep,
beating me to the punch?

382
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:38,735
Of killing you
for driving me so insane.

383
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:41,538
You haven't changed a bit.

384
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:47,010
Nothing's changed.

385
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,723
<i>Please...</i>

386
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:02,725
<i>don't.</i>

387
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:24,147
Enough.
Ivan Fyodo, enough!

388
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:27,450
Do you know what we gain
if he gets to the Rajah?

389
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:31,087
I'm talking about not standing
in the way of the inevitable.

390
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:34,457
Can you not see we are literally
a half-second from doom?

391
00:26:34,525 --> 00:26:36,626
Literally, no.
There's another way.

392
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:38,428
The way of the idiot?

393
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:41,298
We'll all be buried
if we don't play this right.

394
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:48,238
I have nothing against him.
I know what he can do.

395
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,641
But we cannot
make a mistake.

396
00:26:51,709 --> 00:26:53,876
The Rajah has
planned this for ages.

397
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:56,580
And I will not lose
my daughter!

398
00:26:57,748 --> 00:27:00,317
<i>Perhaps I forgot to tell you.</i>

399
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:06,856
<i>In time, Ivan and Porphyria were blessed
with their own princess, Nadya.</i>

400
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:11,027
<i>While Nikolai lives in</i>
<i>the past, his empire decays.</i>

401
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:14,698
<i>Distracted, he lets another</i>
<i>run his kingdom.</i>

402
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:17,334
<i>A man still bent on revenge.</i>

403
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:19,902
- [radio playing]
- # ...way to Tipperary #

404
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,538
# To the sweet-- #

405
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:28,945
- [crack]
- [groans]

406
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:32,782
[radio playing]

407
00:27:34,218 --> 00:27:35,218
Mommy?

408
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,756
Not quite.

409
00:27:39,823 --> 00:27:42,892
<i>Doesn't get much lower</i>
<i>than kidnapping a child.</i>

410
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,265
<i>But the Rajah wouldn't go this far if there wasn't
something else he wanted so very badly:</i>

411
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:50,867
<i>The one that got away.</i>

412
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:53,936
<i>For a long time, the Rajah's</i>
<i>been looking to find me,</i>

413
00:27:54,004 --> 00:27:56,005
<i>looking to kill me.</i>

414
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:58,608
<i>And because of all</i>
<i>that has happened,</i>

415
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:02,512
<i>I have done what I swore</i>
<i>that I would never do:</i>

416
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,147
<i>Go home.</i>

417
00:28:28,539 --> 00:28:32,275
You have come
about the lost one.

418
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:35,445
The one so intimate
with death,

419
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:38,515
but never with dying.

420
00:28:38,582 --> 00:28:42,285
Father, I had to find him.

421
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:48,157
And...
in all that we do, I...

422
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:50,593
I wonder if you are right.

423
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:52,796
- Yet, I feel that--
- My son...

424
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:56,633
you know how often
I had read Othello.

425
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,769
Yet each and every time
I read it,

426
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:02,505
I hope and yearn
and even believe

427
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:06,075
that she, Desdemona,

428
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:10,780
might just live this time.

429
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:12,081
If only...

430
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:14,016
If only...

431
00:29:14,084 --> 00:29:17,754
- Is there no way to fight it?
- One thing I have learned:

432
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,056
You cannot feel
other than how you feel,

433
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:24,661
no matter how much
you long for different,

434
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,831
better emotions.

435
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:31,267
We are but slaves
to ourselves

436
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:35,171
and the blood
that feeds us.

437
00:29:37,908 --> 00:29:41,578
Porphyria, you pit him against the
Rajah, and it will be death of us all.

438
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:45,314
Consider what they
have stolen from me.

439
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,750
From us.

440
00:29:46,817 --> 00:29:50,387
He kidnapped my Nadya.

441
00:29:50,454 --> 00:29:52,054
When do we fight back?

442
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:55,024
Are you as mad
and suicidal as he is?

443
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:58,027
His return here
has sealed his fate.

444
00:29:58,095 --> 00:29:59,829
<i>- Hopefully.</i>
<i>-</i> But only his.

445
00:29:59,897 --> 00:30:01,464
I refuse to believe that.

446
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:04,601
Well, then maybe it's time
you protected him from himself.

447
00:30:04,668 --> 00:30:06,102
Give me that.

448
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:12,241
Send him away, please.

449
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:15,879
Before the inevitable happens.

450
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:21,384
<i>I've waited too long.</i>

451
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:24,421
<i>Like a famous man</i>
<i>once told me,</i>

452
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:27,323
<i>"Less talk, more action."</i>

453
00:30:27,391 --> 00:30:32,595
So, you gonna read me
my rights, Officer?

454
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:34,030
Sure.

455
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:37,033
You have the right to remove
your right strap first.

456
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,204
Slowly.

457
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,817
Are we safe at this speed?

458
00:30:55,218 --> 00:30:56,786
Not for long.

459
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,692
Now the rest.

460
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:09,732
[phone ringing]

461
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,900
Ah, hell.

462
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:13,436
This won't take long.

463
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:16,906
If you move an inch, baby,
I'll kill ya.

464
00:31:16,974 --> 00:31:18,040
[scoffs]

465
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,478
This is Pavlovitch.
This better be good.

466
00:31:23,647 --> 00:31:25,014
Uh--

467
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:29,786
Holy Jeff Markham in tights.
You're alive after all.

468
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:33,255
I got your letter.

469
00:31:33,323 --> 00:31:35,658
Just didn't think you were
crazy enough to return,

470
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:39,762
but then I remembered
who I was dealing with.

471
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:43,199
Look, I got your plans,
I got your information,

472
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:46,102
got your little murder toys.

473
00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:49,171
Just give me a few.
I'm in the midst of, uh...

474
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:51,941
upholding the law.

475
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:54,310
<i># Oh, baby #</i>

476
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:57,146
<i># She can't help it</i>
<i>She was born to be wicked #</i>

477
00:31:57,214 --> 00:31:58,247
Yeah.

478
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:01,350
<i># Baby, oh, baby #</i>

479
00:32:01,418 --> 00:32:05,321
<i># She can't help it</i>
<i>She was born to be wicked #</i>

480
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:09,893
<i># She can't help it</i>
<i>She was born #</i>

481
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:23,806
[yells]

482
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:50,433
You move well for a big man.

483
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,872
[yells]

484
00:32:57,007 --> 00:33:00,342
But nobody moves like me.

485
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:13,856
[yells]

486
00:33:35,245 --> 00:33:38,280
Every now and then,
I put on a jacket

487
00:33:38,348 --> 00:33:41,417
and some trousers
I haven't worn in a while,

488
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:45,287
and every now and then, inside
a pocket, I find a 10-spot.

489
00:33:45,355 --> 00:33:48,324
Maybe a 20
if I'm really lucky.

490
00:33:48,391 --> 00:33:52,729
There's nothing quite like that
feeling of a pleasant little surprise.

491
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:56,232
You? You're not like that.

492
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:58,234
Why would you come back?

493
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,642
I didn't come back.

494
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:08,344
They brought me back.

495
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:12,314
Probably because your pal
Ivan-- or "Ee-van"--

496
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:14,350
maneuvered them into it.

497
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:16,919
You don't look like
any chess piece I know.

498
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:19,288
Certainly not a pawn.

499
00:34:19,356 --> 00:34:22,491
No. I'm just
unfinished business.

500
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,629
Since you're still alive, that
means the Rajah must be slipping.

501
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,531
Or else you've been
planning this all along.

502
00:34:28,598 --> 00:34:31,934
Sitting out
wherever you were.

503
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:34,503
Waiting, thinking.

504
00:34:34,571 --> 00:34:36,039
Clickety clickety click.

505
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:37,740
[groans]

506
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:40,043
You know what I don't like
about you?

507
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:43,079
Aside from the fact that I can
never get a word in edgewise?

508
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:49,251
Every now and then I like to thing that
this is a random world with no consequences,

509
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:50,619
no hand of fate,

510
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,488
and if a beam falls
on my head right now,

511
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:56,592
it's just be a matter
of time and circumstance.

512
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,796
Whenever I look at you,

513
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:03,900
I start to think
that might not be the case.

514
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:05,234
You know what that means?

515
00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:06,669
No.

516
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:11,074
Means we're all
fucked, man.

517
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:14,677
Thanks for the assist.

518
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,545
The old rules apply.

519
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:19,048
Keep things quiet...

520
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:21,483
and in-house...

521
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:23,052
or I'll crush you.

522
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:34,563
All I want from you
is to bring him to us,

523
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:38,267
and everything will
go back to the way it was.

524
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:40,870
You and I know
that's not true.

525
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,706
I know the Rajah's methods.

526
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,675
The poison's already
in my bloodstream.

527
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,212
No. But even if it was,

528
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:51,280
there are many ways to die,
my friend.

529
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:57,653
You know his methods
aren't the nicest ones.

530
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:02,125
So why don't you make it easy
on all of us and bring him here?

531
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:04,827
Never.

532
00:36:07,564 --> 00:36:10,332
You want me to bring in
the little girl

533
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,002
and cut off pieces of her
in front of you?

534
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,937
Keller.

535
00:36:16,273 --> 00:36:17,774
He'll be
on the move now.

536
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:19,976
No time for talking.

537
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,022
Any last words?

538
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,690
Yeah.

539
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:39,328
There's a special providence
when you follow a sparrow.

540
00:36:39,396 --> 00:36:43,099
And this sparrow will
see you both in hell.

541
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,167
[scoffs]

542
00:36:45,335 --> 00:36:48,971
- [stab]
- [screams]

543
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,209
<i>Observation and anticipation.</i>

544
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,878
<i>Lessons I learned long ago.</i>

545
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:58,714
<i>But it's easy for me.</i>

546
00:36:58,782 --> 00:37:01,417
<i>If you don't like</i>
<i>to focus on yourself,</i>

547
00:37:01,484 --> 00:37:03,585
<i>a rare quality,</i>

548
00:37:03,653 --> 00:37:05,321
<i>you might listen to others.</i>

549
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:07,723
<i>An even rarer quality,</i>

550
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:11,727
<i>if you observe</i>
<i>and anticipate,</i>

551
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:14,396
<i>you might just get</i>
<i>something accomplished.</i>

552
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:19,135
<i>To these eyes,</i>
<i>a boring scene.</i>

553
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:22,438
<i>A well-heeled private clinic</i>
<i>hidden in the country,</i>

554
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:25,208
<i>seemingly devoid of life.</i>

555
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:27,376
<i>But through these eyes,</i>

556
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:30,012
<i>the whole world comes alive.</i>

557
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:37,619
<i>And there he is:</i>

558
00:37:37,687 --> 00:37:41,858
<i>the Rajah's prized possession,</i>
<i>Captain Keller.</i>

559
00:37:41,925 --> 00:37:45,394
<i>He's killed more people</i>
<i>than you've met.</i>

560
00:37:45,462 --> 00:37:48,297
<i>A good man to avoid.</i>

561
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,789
<i>Oops.</i>

562
00:38:13,857 --> 00:38:16,158
<i>So much for avoiding him.</i>

563
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:21,630
I trust you're unarmed.

564
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:24,033
I never enter with a gun.

565
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,002
I've heard that about you.

566
00:38:27,737 --> 00:38:29,638
The Monk.

567
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:31,640
The Mad Monk.

568
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:39,548
I've been waiting a long time
for this moment.

569
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,686
Shall we begin?

570
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:47,957
[yells]

571
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:52,828
<i>He's so much more</i>
<i>skilled than me</i>

572
00:38:52,896 --> 00:38:54,830
<i>and very quick.</i>

573
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:56,966
<i>But how's his power?</i>

574
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,837
<i>Power's quite good.</i>

575
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:15,184
<i>In this case,</i>
<i>observation and anticipation</i>

576
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,386
<i>don't appear to have</i>
<i>done me much good.</i>

577
00:39:25,095 --> 00:39:27,396
<i>I could have used rest.</i>

578
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:28,564
[yells]

579
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:30,433
<i>Or training.</i>

580
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:35,904
<i>A mistake, I'll grant you.</i>

581
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:39,675
<i>I have some other techniques,</i>

582
00:39:39,742 --> 00:39:43,079
but they don't seem to be
helping me as much as I'd like.

583
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:12,341
<i>But there's one quality that always
sees me through this kind of thing.</i>

584
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:29,125
No matter how many times I seem
to try and get myself killed...

585
00:40:31,728 --> 00:40:33,629
like Winston Churchill told me,

586
00:40:33,696 --> 00:40:39,402
I never, never, never, never...

587
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:47,843
<i>in nothing, great or small,</i>
<i>large or petty,</i>

588
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:49,811
<i>never give in.</i>

589
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:53,682
[screams]

590
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:58,720
<i>All right.</i>

591
00:40:58,788 --> 00:41:01,490
<i>So maybe anticipation wasn't</i>
<i>a total failure after all.</i>

592
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:03,792
For God's sakes,
what is this?

593
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,627
[panting]

594
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:07,296
This isn't your M.O.

595
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:10,166
You work alone.

596
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:13,469
Except on special occasions.

597
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:17,940
Captain Keller,
meet Dr. Sebastian,

598
00:41:18,007 --> 00:41:20,209
an old acquaintance.

599
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,610
Hello.

600
00:41:23,513 --> 00:41:29,452
As we near the half minute mark,
I'll limit my usual, drawn-out anatomy lesson.

601
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:31,653
The strange sensation
you now experience

602
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:35,224
comes from the laceration
of your femoral artery.

603
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:36,825
If it were a partial tear,

604
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:39,695
and you had access to
qualified medical personnel,

605
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:42,064
you might have a chance.

606
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:46,668
But I'm afraid my incision has
seen to a complete severing.

607
00:41:49,973 --> 00:41:55,111
Funny, the eccentricities
of human existence.

608
00:41:55,178 --> 00:41:57,980
Despite years
of martial artistry

609
00:41:58,047 --> 00:41:59,848
and a triathlete's endurance,

610
00:41:59,916 --> 00:42:07,055
one little slice defies
this lifetime of training.

611
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,158
The importance of
this avenue of blood flow

612
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:14,430
robs you of your formidable
strength each passing second.

613
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:18,800
Even now you are but a mere
infant, mewling and bleeding,

614
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:24,006
in your nurse's arms,
crawling to oblivion.

615
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:25,874
You won't find
what you've come for.

616
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:27,309
The Rajah will get you.

617
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:29,311
Shh.

618
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:31,913
As I've opened the floodgates
of your very mortality,

619
00:42:31,981 --> 00:42:35,351
may I suggest you quickly
choose one subject to dwell on

620
00:42:35,418 --> 00:42:37,253
instead of many?

621
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,223
I certainly wouldn't recommend
you worry about work at this point.

622
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:51,367
Already, you're
experiencing the onset.

623
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:54,002
The clamminess.

624
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,038
The narrowing.

625
00:42:57,507 --> 00:43:01,210
The finality of your life
approaches.

626
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:05,847
Seize that which
you cherish most

627
00:43:05,915 --> 00:43:08,217
and hold onto it.

628
00:43:18,061 --> 00:43:22,731
Good night, sweet prince.

629
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:32,174
Nice of you to share
this procedure with me.

630
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,176
I hope you won't think me
the blushing virgin

631
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:38,380
if I reveal that I have been
anxiously awaiting this day.

632
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:42,318
Shall we?

633
00:43:52,962 --> 00:43:55,464
That Keller
was quite skilled.

634
00:43:55,532 --> 00:44:00,469
I almost felt like watching to see
if even you could have outlasted him.

635
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,504
It might have been close.

636
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:04,072
Indeed.

637
00:44:06,476 --> 00:44:10,246
May I suggest you consider
working on your defense a bit?

638
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:13,616
You concentrate entirely
too much on attack.

639
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,453
Your coat, sir.

640
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,558
And your card.

641
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:26,061
Oh, dear.

642
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:28,464
Let's straighten up
that collar.

643
00:44:28,531 --> 00:44:32,501
It's too bad about the blood,
but it is a clinic.

644
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,303
There. That's better.

645
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:38,907
Everything is set.
I shall see you shortly.

646
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:41,577
<i>As talented as Sebastian is,</i>

647
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,845
<i>I have to say I hesitated</i>
<i>to ask for his help.</i>

648
00:44:43,913 --> 00:44:46,181
- [whistling]
- Hey! How you been, Doc?

649
00:44:46,249 --> 00:44:48,250
Couldn't be better,
Alberto.

650
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,018
Couldn't be better.

651
00:44:50,086 --> 00:44:53,021
<i>Maybe it's just because,</i>
<i>unlike me,</i>

652
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:55,691
he enjoys what he does so much.

653
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:58,427
<i>Despite what you might think,</i>

654
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,596
<i>I have never taken joy</i>
<i>in killing.</i>

655
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:05,334
In fact, I hate what I do.
I just happen to be good at it.

656
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,375
Head's up.
We got company.

657
00:45:13,443 --> 00:45:16,111
What are you doing
down here, sir?

658
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:18,514
Lung therapy.

659
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:20,148
- [stab]
- [groans]

660
00:45:21,918 --> 00:45:22,851
[groaning]

661
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:27,923
The pneumothorax is most
unpleasant, isn't it?

662
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,358
[gasping]

663
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:32,461
My scalpels punctured
one of each of your lungs.

664
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:35,331
Even now, your lung collapses.

665
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:39,568
Hardly fatal,
but, oh, so painful.

666
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:41,937
Yet, I know
what you're thinking.

667
00:45:42,004 --> 00:45:45,941
What if both lungs
are pierced?

668
00:45:46,008 --> 00:45:47,710
I can assure you

669
00:45:47,777 --> 00:45:50,446
the resulting death takes
far longer than it should

670
00:45:50,513 --> 00:45:53,415
under the watchful eye
of a merciful God.

671
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:55,818
But as with all things,

672
00:45:55,885 --> 00:45:59,087
our very biological
structure promise us

673
00:45:59,155 --> 00:46:02,758
that if it be now,
'tis not to come.

674
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,961
If it be not to come,
it will be now.

675
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:10,332
If it be not now,
yet it will come.

676
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,201
Good sirs,

677
00:46:13,269 --> 00:46:16,538
the readiness is all.

678
00:46:17,807 --> 00:46:19,375
- [stabs]
- [groans]

679
00:46:25,448 --> 00:46:29,885
<i>Sebastian will see</i>
<i>to the generator in three...</i>

680
00:46:29,952 --> 00:46:32,554
- Eyes!
<i>- two...</i>

681
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:33,756
<i>one.</i>

682
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:40,429
<i>I can handle the rest.</i>

683
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,625
She looks so very much
like her mother.

684
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:12,795
Don't you think?

685
00:47:18,167 --> 00:47:20,135
She looks like you, too.

686
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:22,938
"Dr. Myshkin"?

687
00:47:23,005 --> 00:47:24,339
No.

688
00:47:25,975 --> 00:47:27,643
She does not.

689
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:37,385
It's been such a long time
since we've seen each other.

690
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:39,254
So very long.

691
00:47:41,223 --> 00:47:42,524
[sighs]

692
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:44,927
There was a time we greeted
each other differently.

693
00:47:49,732 --> 00:47:51,967
There was a time
we greeted each other.

694
00:47:55,204 --> 00:47:57,138
Has Nikolai been
treating you well?

695
00:47:57,206 --> 00:47:59,908
Up till now.

696
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:03,879
I'm sorry
it's come to this.

697
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:06,114
I will not follow.

698
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,520
You be gentle with her.

699
00:48:11,588 --> 00:48:14,790
Tell her mother
I allowed this peaceably.

700
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,825
Don't hurt
any more of my men...

701
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:21,797
or I will find you.

702
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:24,933
Understood.

703
00:48:27,837 --> 00:48:30,238
Good-bye, cousin.

704
00:48:30,306 --> 00:48:32,040
Thank you.

705
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:38,179
<i>Since I was a boy,</i>
<i>he took care of me.</i>

706
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:41,182
<i>And this is how I repay him.</i>

707
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,718
<i>I hate myself.</i>

708
00:48:42,785 --> 00:48:45,587
Forgive me,
cousin.

709
00:48:47,957 --> 00:48:49,725
North quad is clear.

710
00:48:53,195 --> 00:48:56,231
Shh. As you go to sleep,

711
00:48:56,298 --> 00:49:01,236
let me explain the effects of
strangulation on your laryngeal muscles.

712
00:49:05,808 --> 00:49:06,842
Stay right there!

713
00:49:09,378 --> 00:49:11,046
[yelps]

714
00:49:13,616 --> 00:49:16,284
Jugular, carotid, jugular.

715
00:49:16,352 --> 00:49:18,153
Carotid, jugular.

716
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,721
Sebastian!

717
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:23,224
No more. Please.

718
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:25,961
Do you only kill now
in her name?

719
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:28,363
No.

720
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:30,666
Only if necessary.

721
00:49:34,003 --> 00:49:37,072
- Or when it's deserved.
- Deserved?

722
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:39,007
Why, if that were the case,
comrade,

723
00:49:39,075 --> 00:49:41,843
you could never stop to rest.

724
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:45,047
Still, I must admit,

725
00:49:45,114 --> 00:49:47,415
you disappoint me.

726
00:49:47,483 --> 00:49:49,851
How fitting.

727
00:49:49,919 --> 00:49:53,021
Not a day in my life passes
that I don't disappoint myself.

728
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:55,791
Ah, there's the rub.

729
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:57,826
Still, despite
certain fixations,

730
00:49:57,894 --> 00:50:01,697
I never thought you'd succumb to the
notion of the preciousness of life.

731
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:08,770
Does it seems so ludicrous
when you look upon her?

732
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:16,344
She is magnificent.

733
00:50:16,412 --> 00:50:22,450
As beautiful
as she is sweet.

734
00:50:22,518 --> 00:50:25,887
And yet, an organism
not so different

735
00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:31,059
from yonder snail that streaks
across the outer wall.

736
00:50:31,127 --> 00:50:35,864
Do the snail's parents want nothing
but the best for their child?

737
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:40,736
Do they grieve at the child's
passing if it goes before them?

738
00:50:40,803 --> 00:50:42,771
No, my friend.

739
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:47,175
Not even such an angelic face
would have me believe.

740
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:51,613
Yes, I know.

741
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:55,450
I must go.
Thank you, old friend.

742
00:50:55,518 --> 00:50:57,753
Anytime, tovarich.

743
00:51:02,324 --> 00:51:04,526
I await your next call.

744
00:51:04,593 --> 00:51:06,695
[guard groans]

745
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:07,763
Ah!

746
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,098
Ivan!

747
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:11,833
Ivan!

748
00:51:11,901 --> 00:51:12,934
Coming!

749
00:51:13,002 --> 00:51:14,936
We need to talk.

750
00:51:16,105 --> 00:51:17,973
- Nadya!
- When did she leave?

751
00:51:18,041 --> 00:51:22,010
Doctor, quickly!
Nadya's back!

752
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:24,746
Give her to me.
I'll take care of her.

753
00:51:24,814 --> 00:51:26,815
Ivan, this is
what I'm here for.

754
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:28,750
I need to make sure
she's all right.

755
00:51:28,818 --> 00:51:30,285
Please hurry.

756
00:51:30,352 --> 00:51:32,253
Come on, Nadya.

757
00:51:34,123 --> 00:51:35,724
When?

758
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:38,593
I don't know.
I thought she was with you.

759
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:40,729
No.

760
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,630
He knew.

761
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,867
<i>It seems I'm not</i>
<i>as clever as I thought</i>

762
00:51:45,935 --> 00:51:49,171
<i>Nikolai knew</i>
<i>I would go for Nadya.</i>

763
00:51:49,238 --> 00:51:51,573
<i>He always told me to have</i>
<i>a contingency plan.</i>

764
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,608
Hello, my niece.

765
00:51:56,278 --> 00:51:59,314
You've lost the right
to call me that

766
00:51:59,381 --> 00:52:01,583
the day you killed
my father.

767
00:52:03,352 --> 00:52:08,090
That, like so much else,
was an unfortunate necessity.

768
00:52:08,157 --> 00:52:09,991
How can you say that?

769
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:16,965
You forget that Sergei
brought her here to spite me.

770
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:20,501
And that is nothing
compared to the fact

771
00:52:20,569 --> 00:52:23,872
that he abandoned her just
like he abandoned your mother.

772
00:52:27,309 --> 00:52:29,010
He was your brother,
Nikolai

773
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,580
You cannot
understand.

774
00:52:32,648 --> 00:52:37,619
Tatiana was an angel,
utterly pure,

775
00:52:37,686 --> 00:52:40,989
and Sergei brought her
into my world.

776
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:44,459
And she--

777
00:52:44,526 --> 00:52:46,694
love of my life--

778
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:49,965
killed herself...

779
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:53,869
because of Sergei.

780
00:52:56,672 --> 00:52:58,606
That was unforgivable.

781
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:02,210
Then you should have
killed yourself,

782
00:53:02,278 --> 00:53:05,847
and none of this
would have happened.

783
00:53:05,915 --> 00:53:10,518
I have thought about it
once or twice.

784
00:53:10,586 --> 00:53:14,455
If I had,

785
00:53:14,523 --> 00:53:18,459
Porphyria's lover
might not exist,

786
00:53:18,527 --> 00:53:20,228
and I don't mean Ivan.

787
00:53:20,296 --> 00:53:21,329
How dare you.

788
00:53:21,397 --> 00:53:22,998
[chuckles]

789
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:27,302
Yes.

790
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:29,171
How dare I.

791
00:53:30,773 --> 00:53:35,177
Meanwhile, in spite
of all my efforts,

792
00:53:35,244 --> 00:53:39,380
the Rajah will not stop
until he has his vengeance.

793
00:53:39,448 --> 00:53:41,649
Will you tell him the truth?

794
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:44,519
That you killed his father.

795
00:53:44,586 --> 00:53:46,855
Or just kill the Rajah?

796
00:53:50,693 --> 00:53:54,896
Don't both of us know
that I cannot do that?

797
00:53:54,964 --> 00:53:59,134
It pains me
to tell you this.

798
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:02,370
The Rajah has him.

799
00:54:02,438 --> 00:54:08,676
He went to the clinic to try
and rescue your beautiful Nadya,

800
00:54:08,744 --> 00:54:11,479
and together
they very nearly escaped.

801
00:54:11,547 --> 00:54:13,614
I don't--
I don't believe you.

802
00:54:17,186 --> 00:54:21,723
I have managed to hold
the Rajah at bay, Porphyria.

803
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:27,295
But now I need your help
to save <i>him.</i>

804
00:54:27,363 --> 00:54:30,098
Why would you do that?

805
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:34,135
You think that
I who raised him

806
00:54:34,203 --> 00:54:36,938
wish to see him suffer?

807
00:54:37,006 --> 00:54:39,007
You took Nadya.
I don't trust you.

808
00:54:42,945 --> 00:54:44,412
Perhaps you shouldn't.

809
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,050
[speaking Russian]

810
00:54:52,488 --> 00:54:54,289
You bastard.

811
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:57,926
You will thank me,
eventually.

812
00:54:57,994 --> 00:55:01,997
When all this
is brought to an end

813
00:55:02,064 --> 00:55:04,599
and your daughter
is returned to you,

814
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:06,734
the truce is restored,

815
00:55:06,802 --> 00:55:10,105
you can live in peace.

816
00:55:10,172 --> 00:55:13,574
And as for my wayward
prodigal son,

817
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:16,544
God have mercy upon him.

818
00:55:20,682 --> 00:55:26,321
He will die in peace
so all this can happen.

819
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:28,056
He's not your son.

820
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:34,695
Perhaps not, but trust me
when I tell you this.

821
00:55:34,763 --> 00:55:39,867
I will put an end
to his suffering.

822
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:42,370
That much he will know.

823
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:43,905
I swear.

824
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:55,483
<i>The center of the city is the
downtown metropolis portion.</i>

825

- [line ringing]
- <i>To me, the center of the city</i>

826
00:55:58,921 --> 00:56:02,490
<i>is that point which allows you
to get you where you need to be</i>

<i>- as quickly as possible.</i>
<i>-</i> [phone picked up]

828

<i>- Hello, Ivan.</i>

829
00:56:06,762 --> 00:56:09,164
<i>Nice night for a drive,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

830
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:12,067
If you ever want to see
Porphyria alive again,

831
00:56:12,134 --> 00:56:14,302
be at the bunkers
in two hours...

832
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,405
<i>with him. Only one car</i>
<i>will be allowed in.</i>

833
00:56:17,473 --> 00:56:20,108
<i>[Ivan on phone] For God's sake, be reasonable.
I can't get there that fast.</i>

834
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:23,811
<i>All right. You have</i>
<i>two hours and one minute.</i>

835
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:31,252
<i>[narrator]</i>
<i>The bunkers.</i>

836
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,754
<i>The Rajah couldn't resist.</i>

837
00:56:33,822 --> 00:56:35,957
<i>I see his point.</i>

838
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:38,393
<i>His father died here.</i>

839
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,362
<i>We were trained here.</i>

840
00:56:40,429 --> 00:56:43,764
<i>Differences were always</i>
<i>settled here.</i>

841
00:56:43,832 --> 00:56:47,702
<i>And now the blood spilled on this
concrete must be getting lonely.</i>

842
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:57,479

<i>his men in place.</i>

843
00:56:57,546 --> 00:57:00,948
<i>He can arrive shortly</i>

<i>The renowned samurai</i>

<i>Sometimes, Musashi</i>

<i>Practical, yes,</i>

00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,160
None of my actions
are his fault.

873
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:26,827
He's opposed me
in all of this.

874
00:59:26,895 --> 00:59:31,366
My time is done here.
See you later, my boy.

875
00:59:34,836 --> 00:59:37,472
Lovely lady...

876
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,007
I've waited for you
my whole life.

877
00:59:40,075 --> 00:59:42,410
<i>[Young Porphyria]</i>
<i>Daddy, where's mommy?</i>

878
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:43,878
[gunshot]

879
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:48,550
<i>[narrator]</i>
<i>She is magnificent.</i>

880
00:59:48,617 --> 00:59:51,319
<i>But this is no longer</i>
<i>her fight.</i>

881
00:59:57,092 --> 00:59:58,793
[gunshot]

882
01:00:02,665 --> 01:00:04,499
<i>For what he has done</i>
<i>this night,</i>

883
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:07,101
<i>I could have</i>
<i>killed him already.</i>

884
01:00:07,169 --> 01:00:12,207
<i>But the Rajah's earned</i>
<i>the right to see my face</i>

885
01:00:12,274 --> 01:00:14,209
<i>at the time of reckoning.</i>

886
01:00:14,276 --> 01:00:15,443
Go.

887
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:16,744
No.

888
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:18,313
- Please.
- No.

889
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,047
You must leave now.

890
01:00:20,115 --> 01:00:23,418
Take their car.
Call Ivan.

891
01:00:23,485 --> 01:00:25,587
He's already on his way.

892
01:00:25,654 --> 01:00:29,457
I share as much history
with him as you do.

893
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:32,694
I deserve vengeance
as much as you.

894
01:00:32,761 --> 01:00:34,429
Perhaps even more so.
I'm not leaving.

895
01:00:34,496 --> 01:00:38,366
Perhaps you will still
get that chance.

896
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:41,001
But this is no longer
your concern.

897
01:00:41,069 --> 01:00:44,672
There's a little angel
waiting for you.

898
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:48,843
She's unharmed
and oh so beautiful.

899
01:00:51,113 --> 01:00:53,281
Please go to her.

900
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:54,515
Please.

901
01:01:25,547 --> 01:01:29,817
<i>Was it my father who killed</i>
<i>the Rajah's father?</i>

902
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:33,087
<i>The Rajah killed</i>
<i>my cousin Ganya.</i>

903
01:01:33,155 --> 01:01:37,224
<i>Who's to say more of his
ancestors did not kill more of mine?</i>

904
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:39,360
<i>How must this all look</i>
<i>from his point of view?</i>

905
01:01:39,428 --> 01:01:42,997
[Rajah] What fate imprisons
us that we must now do this?

906
01:01:43,064 --> 01:01:44,632
What have we become?

907
01:02:10,726 --> 01:02:12,760
<i>So fast.</i>

908
01:02:12,828 --> 01:02:16,597
<i>I could die here.</i>
<i>Maybe I should die here.</i>

909
01:02:25,407 --> 01:02:30,845
<i>Pithing, the art of severing</i>
<i>the spinal cord at the neck.</i>

910
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:32,714
<i>It's the Rajah's specialty.</i>

911
01:02:32,781 --> 01:02:36,718
How does it feel to die
at my hands...

912
01:02:36,785 --> 01:02:40,388
as you kiss life goodbye,
knowing she will soon follow?

913
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:41,456
Tell me.

914
01:02:41,523 --> 01:02:43,591
How does it feel?

915
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:45,393
<i>Or it was.</i>

916
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:56,070
<i>I will show my true form.</i>

917
01:02:56,137 --> 01:02:58,339
<i>I will baptize myself</i>
<i>with hate.</i>

918
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,875
I wanted you
to taste victory,

919
01:03:00,942 --> 01:03:03,578
to think that you
would go unpunished.

920
01:03:03,645 --> 01:03:06,581
I wanted you
to consider tomorrow

921
01:03:06,648 --> 01:03:10,351
as you fight for breath
that will not come.

922
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:15,089
I want you to think of life
and all that you cherish

923
01:03:15,156 --> 01:03:20,027
and to ache with every fiber of
your being for what you cannot have!

924
01:03:20,095 --> 01:03:22,329
[groans]

925
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:26,601
I want you to do
what I do every day.

926
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:34,609
I want you to suffer.

927
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:41,883
<i>I believe</i>
<i>I already told you.</i>

928
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:46,454
<i>Anticipation is</i>
<i>one of my specialties.</i>

929
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:50,591
<i>If brain hypoxia sets in,</i>
<i>he'll die,</i>

930
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:52,593
<i>and I just can't</i>
<i>let that happen.</i>

931
01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:54,695
<i>Not to him.</i>

932
01:03:54,763 --> 01:03:56,664
<i>No.</i>

933
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:59,734
<i>That would be too easy.</i>

934
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:01,636
<i>I'll revive him.</i>

935
01:04:01,703 --> 01:04:04,305
<i>But first,</i>
<i>a little surgery.</i>

936
01:04:05,574 --> 01:04:08,242
Never again
will you touch her.

937
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:10,311
Never will you hurt her.

938
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:15,249
You shall be like me,
my brother.

939
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,155
A prisoner
of your own flesh.

940
01:04:31,299 --> 01:04:33,835
<i>Special delivery, Nikolai.</i>

941
01:04:33,902 --> 01:04:35,870
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

942
01:04:37,673 --> 01:04:39,474
[Porphyria]
Nadya!

943
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:42,643
Nadya! Nadya!

944
01:04:42,711 --> 01:04:45,045
Oh, my baby!

945
01:04:50,418 --> 01:04:53,588
I've been expecting you,
my pale Tetsuya.

946
01:04:53,655 --> 01:04:56,023
[coughs]

947
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:57,324
I can see that.

948
01:04:57,392 --> 01:04:59,660
Oh, this?

949
01:04:59,728 --> 01:05:02,363
Just my usual
narcotic nightcap.

950
01:05:06,134 --> 01:05:07,902
[exhales]

951
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,971
There.

952
01:05:10,038 --> 01:05:11,806
[inhales]

953
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,674
I'm cured.

954
01:05:13,742 --> 01:05:15,676
Let's get a look at you.

955
01:05:24,486 --> 01:05:26,253
Well...

956
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:29,690
Added a few to
the tapestry of pain, I see.

957
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:36,697
So what's your story,
genius?

958
01:05:36,765 --> 01:05:39,767
Come back into town
on your big white horse,

959
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:41,602
kill a bunch of killers

960
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:45,472
so you can save a beautiful little
girl and her beautiful little mother

961
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:48,943
that you can never really
tell how you feel?

962
01:05:54,082 --> 01:05:56,684
Interesting.

963
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:58,352
Your tooth?

964
01:06:00,121 --> 01:06:01,221
Hmm.

965
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:04,759
Where was I?

966
01:06:04,826 --> 01:06:10,297
Still trying to preserve some
fantasy of purpose and nobility

967
01:06:10,365 --> 01:06:12,667
in a world that has none?

968
01:06:13,735 --> 01:06:15,369
[groans]

969
01:06:15,437 --> 01:06:18,973
Got a few ribs
broken?

970
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,642
Something like that.

971
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:23,678
So what do you need?

972
01:06:26,114 --> 01:06:28,348
I need to finish
my work tonight.

973
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:30,384
[scoffs]
That's a good one.

974
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:33,153
And if I thought you were
a total fucking idiot,

975
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:37,357
I'd think you were actually talking
about going to Nikolai's place.

976
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:44,031
Let me get
my painkillers, idiot.

977
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:49,670
I'm going to keep you as lucid
and functional as possible.

978
01:06:49,738 --> 01:06:51,538
You'll be in intense
and debilitating pain,

979
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:55,710
which I imagine will come as
somewhat of a relief for you.

980
01:06:55,777 --> 01:06:57,377
Sunday afternoon stuff.

981
01:06:57,445 --> 01:06:59,546
You know, you did the world
a great disservice by,

982
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,849
well, whatever the hell it
was you did to the Rajah.

983
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:04,118
He had such a bright
medical future.

984
01:07:04,185 --> 01:07:07,354
It's funny how things
conspire to derail a life,

985
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:09,556
to ensure that
what was meant to be...

986
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:10,725
[cracks]

987
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:12,226
[groans]

988
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:18,032
never happens.

989
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,300
[chuckles]

990
01:07:20,368 --> 01:07:22,302
Yeah, funny.

991
01:07:22,370 --> 01:07:25,773
Now, I would love to get into
your medical history one day.

992
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:28,175
What do you know
about your father?

993
01:07:29,778 --> 01:07:35,683
I know I never knew
who my father is...

994
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,819
or was...

995
01:07:38,887 --> 01:07:41,355
out of the men
that he could be.

996
01:07:42,457 --> 01:07:44,659
Well, that clears that up.

997
01:07:44,726 --> 01:07:46,627
But I have my own theories
on that end.

998
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:50,698
And the great wildcard,
Mommy Dearest?

999
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:54,035
Long story.

1000
01:07:54,102 --> 01:07:55,903
[chuckles]
Yeah, I know.

1001
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,404
My mother was
very generous.

1002
01:07:57,472 --> 01:08:01,642
She passed on a certain
predilection for addiction

1003
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:05,212
that not even a lifetime of
medical education has overcome.

1004
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,614
[chuckles]

1005
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,050
Score one for heredity.

1006
01:08:09,117 --> 01:08:11,418
Is that was this is?

1007
01:08:11,486 --> 01:08:14,855
Resigned finality?

1008
01:08:14,923 --> 01:08:17,291
Bowing to the hand of fate?

1009
01:08:17,358 --> 01:08:20,194
Just remember the story
of Flitcraft, my friend.

1010
01:08:20,261 --> 01:08:24,431
He vanished and left his old
life behind for a new one.

1011
01:08:24,499 --> 01:08:27,634
Flitcraft never wanted to
go back to his old life.

1012
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:30,237
That was
kind of the point.

1013
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:35,542
Thank you, Grand Inquisitor.

1014
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:38,278
I'll try to remember that.

1015
01:08:38,346 --> 01:08:41,648
[beeping]

1016
01:08:47,422 --> 01:08:50,991
Hmm. Where do you want me
to move the queen?

1017
01:08:51,059 --> 01:08:52,793
Should I?

1018
01:08:58,466 --> 01:09:01,102
Are you all right?

1019
01:09:01,169 --> 01:09:03,237
What happened?

1020
01:09:03,304 --> 01:09:06,040
I...

1021
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:08,142
negotiated
with the Rajah.

1022
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:13,948
How did you know
where to find her?

1023
01:09:14,015 --> 01:09:15,983
I have my ways.

1024
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:19,253
God, you really do.

1025
01:09:21,923 --> 01:09:23,124
[Porphyria]
Let's continue.

1026
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:28,129
It's your turn?

1027
01:09:37,405 --> 01:09:39,273
You can't go.

1028
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:42,442
Oh, please.
Don't even say it.

1029
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:44,378
Neither one of us
is going to convince him.

1030
01:09:44,445 --> 01:09:47,547
I'm going to see Nikolai.

1031
01:09:47,615 --> 01:09:50,151
You absolutely are not.

1032
01:09:50,218 --> 01:09:54,354
This-- All of this
ends tonight.

1033
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:01,495
- You owe me nothing.
- That's not true.

1034
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:06,834
Go to him.

1035
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:08,803
- How can you keep doing this to me?
- To you?

1036
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:11,806
- I'm doing this <i>for</i> you.
- They'll kill you.

1037
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:14,175
Maybe not.
I could get unlucky.

1038
01:10:14,242 --> 01:10:18,078
- [church bell tolling]
- Please, listen.

1039
01:10:18,146 --> 01:10:20,815
Listen to me.
Please don't leave.

1040
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:24,151
Don't leave me again.

1041
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:28,322
Porphyria, don't do this.
Not now.

1042
01:10:28,389 --> 01:10:30,424
It doesn't have
to be like this.

1043
01:10:30,491 --> 01:10:33,393
If the Rajah's really dead,
then Nikolai's gonna leave us alone.

1044
01:10:33,461 --> 01:10:35,662
- He will!
- Please.

1045
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:38,398
Even if by some miracle
that was true,

1046
01:10:38,466 --> 01:10:40,500
I need to see him...

1047
01:10:41,903 --> 01:10:43,503
one last time.

1048
01:10:43,571 --> 01:10:47,474
You don't have to be
so invulnerable, you know?

1049
01:10:47,542 --> 01:10:50,144
Whatever happened to
the beautiful boy that I knew,

1050
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:54,414
the boy that saved me,
the boy that I loved?

1051
01:10:54,482 --> 01:10:56,217
Please.

1052
01:11:07,462 --> 01:11:09,796
What happened?

1053
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:14,235
That boy,
the one you loved,

1054
01:11:14,302 --> 01:11:19,073
that little boy
who loved you so,

1055
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,809
his mother
killed herself.

1056
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:25,145
He never knew
his father.

1057
01:11:25,213 --> 01:11:26,780
No.

1058
01:11:26,848 --> 01:11:30,617
He only ever wanted...

1059
01:11:30,685 --> 01:11:33,687
the one thing
he could never have.

1060
01:11:36,491 --> 01:11:39,093
Over the years,

1061
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,661
I have murdered
many, many people.

1062
01:11:41,729 --> 01:11:44,365
[sobs]

1063
01:11:44,432 --> 01:11:48,335
The first one I killed was
that innocent little boy.

1064
01:11:48,403 --> 01:11:51,372
I'll do anything.
I'll do anything.

1065
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:54,141
No.

1066
01:11:58,246 --> 01:12:00,214
Oh, my God.

1067
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:04,118
Oh, my...

1068
01:12:13,428 --> 01:12:16,530
<i>You see before you</i>
<i>Nikolai's place.</i>

1069
01:12:16,597 --> 01:12:21,135
<i>A millionaire built it at the turn
of the century as his lasting legacy.</i>

1070
01:12:21,202 --> 01:12:25,072
<i>Strangely enough, he fired the
architect he first brought on</i>

1071
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,842
<i>and hired a young $5.00 a
week draftsman named George.</i>

1072
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:32,079
- [door buzzer]
- <i>Nobody really knows why.</i>

1073
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:34,415
<i>I hope George was getting</i>
<i>more than $5.00 a week</i>

1074
01:12:34,482 --> 01:12:36,283
<i>when he delivered</i>
<i>these blueprints.</i>

1075
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,618
Slowly.
Hands raised.

1076
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:42,022
<i>My old friend Kolya.</i>

1077
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:43,390
You know the way.

1078
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:47,627
<i>Ever loyal, ever dangerous.</i>

1079
01:12:47,695 --> 01:12:51,231
It is pointless
to ask you to leave, yes?

1080
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,269
Of course.

1081
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:57,604
You ever find
a gun you like?

1082
01:12:57,672 --> 01:12:59,974
Sure.

1083
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:01,708
The other guy's.

1084
01:13:01,776 --> 01:13:03,743
[chuckles]

1085
01:13:03,811 --> 01:13:07,547
Still so much gallows humor
for such a young man,

1086
01:13:07,615 --> 01:13:10,817
especially one
so reluctant to die.

1087
01:13:10,885 --> 01:13:13,220
Not reluctant.

1088
01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:15,322
Just resilient.

1089
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:17,091
Like you taught me to be.

1090
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:19,426
Yes.

1091
01:13:19,494 --> 01:13:21,228
Resilient.

1092
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:25,332
Come.

1093
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,635
Do you remember the story of
the man who designed this place?

1094
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:31,372
Tell me again, please.

1095
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:34,174
Untrained as an architect,

1096
01:13:34,242 --> 01:13:39,480
he only agreed to design this place
after he consulted his brother,

1097
01:13:39,547 --> 01:13:42,516
his dead brother,
using a Ouija board.

1098
01:13:43,885 --> 01:13:47,287
Oh, that kooky
George.

1099
01:13:47,355 --> 01:13:50,690
Yes. Kooky.

1100
01:13:50,758 --> 01:13:56,296
<i>Sadly, this place was George's</i>
<i>one moment of brilliance.</i>

1101
01:13:56,364 --> 01:13:59,533
<i>He actually became</i>
<i>a full-fledged architect,</i>

1102
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,136
<i>but an undistinguished one.</i>

1103
01:14:02,203 --> 01:14:05,672
<i>It seems either school</i>
<i>or this building</i>

1104
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:09,643
<i>conspired to suck all the</i>
<i>creative genius out of George.</i>

1105
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:16,450
<i>Still, if you had to have one instance
of divine inspiration and achievement,</i>

1106
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:17,684
<i>not bad.</i>

1107
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:21,188
Wait here,
please.

1108
01:14:25,026 --> 01:14:29,629
<i>Soon, Nikolai's men</i>
<i>will enter this room,</i>

1109
01:14:29,697 --> 01:14:31,565
<i>ready to kill me.</i>

1110
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:36,537
<i>Seems like a good time</i>
<i>to catch up on my sleep.</i>

1111
01:14:46,914 --> 01:14:48,815
[Kolya]
It's time.

1112
01:14:48,883 --> 01:14:50,884
[guns cocking]

1113
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:03,063
[elevator whirring]

1114
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:04,398
[gates opening]

1115
01:15:10,938 --> 01:15:13,940
<i>And there he is,</i>
<i>the man himself.</i>

1116
01:15:20,748 --> 01:15:22,649
<i>Thank God.</i>

1117
01:15:22,717 --> 01:15:25,285
<i>He still doesn't miss a beat.</i>

1118
01:15:27,989 --> 01:15:31,725
<i>These B-movie mongrels</i>
<i>still belong to him.</i>

1119
01:15:31,792 --> 01:15:33,627
Gentlemen?

1120
01:15:33,694 --> 01:15:35,996
<i>They don't know the history</i>
<i>between all of us.</i>

1121
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,365
Is he clean?

1122
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:39,733
As ever.

1123
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,602
[Nikolai]
Very well.

1124
01:15:41,669 --> 01:15:43,504
[speaking Russian]

1125
01:15:48,376 --> 01:15:51,145
You know, in this light,
I can almost see your cousin.

1126
01:15:51,212 --> 01:15:54,781
But it is the resemblance to
your father that stops the mind.

1127
01:15:54,849 --> 01:15:57,017
You agree, Kolya?

1128
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:03,257
Wow.

1129
01:16:03,324 --> 01:16:04,991
Something wrong?

1130
01:16:05,059 --> 01:16:06,926
No.

1131
01:16:06,994 --> 01:16:10,063
This is just a very,
very big basement.

1132
01:16:10,131 --> 01:16:12,832
Has it been so long
since you last saw it?

1133
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:14,368
I think not.

1134
01:16:16,904 --> 01:16:21,308
Still, I was hoping to be
spared all this pain.

1135
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:25,712
Once, seeing you
was like a benediction.

1136
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:27,381
And now?

1137
01:16:28,816 --> 01:16:31,385
Now, why do this
to my adopted son?

1138
01:16:31,452 --> 01:16:32,919
<i>Rats.</i>

1139
01:16:32,987 --> 01:16:35,622
<i>There goes all the small talk</i>
<i>I was looking forward to.</i>

1140
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:37,991
It's been so long
since I've seen Porphyria.

1141
01:16:38,059 --> 01:16:39,025
<i>Liar.</i>

1142
01:16:39,093 --> 01:16:41,861
Her daughter, of course,
is a revelation.

1143
01:16:41,929 --> 01:16:45,365
Alas, I would regret the way
things have turned out

1144
01:16:45,433 --> 01:16:51,171
if I thought we, each of us,
could do anything about it.

1145
01:17:14,028 --> 01:17:15,295
[coughing]

1146
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:21,268
Next?

1147
01:17:27,675 --> 01:17:31,411
Not bad, Little Boy Blue,
but your kick lacks power.

1148
01:17:32,947 --> 01:17:36,082
You need to bring the force
up through your leg,

1149
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:38,051
into your hips,

1150
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:40,454
chamber your kick
and then explode.

1151
01:17:44,392 --> 01:17:46,526
<i>Much better.</i>

1152
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:53,099
[Rogozhin]
Rise and shine, mate.

1153
01:17:56,937 --> 01:17:59,673
No. No.

1154
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:01,941
Nikolai.

1155
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:08,715
- Cousin...
- Don't you dare do this.

1156
01:18:08,783 --> 01:18:09,949
Don't you dare!

1157
01:18:11,218 --> 01:18:14,220
Stop this!

1158
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:16,122
Not him!

1159
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:19,393
Cousin.

1160
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:21,395
What are you waiting for?
Pull the bloody trigger.

1161
01:18:21,462 --> 01:18:23,363
No!

1162
01:18:24,965 --> 01:18:28,101
It's better you
than these bastards.

1163
01:18:28,169 --> 01:18:31,371
Please. I can't.

1164
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:34,240
Now pull
that bloody trigger.

1165
01:18:36,076 --> 01:18:38,812
Pull that trigger!

1166
01:18:38,879 --> 01:18:40,146
Nikolai!

1167
01:18:40,214 --> 01:18:41,981
[Rogozhin]
Pull the trigger!

1168
01:18:42,049 --> 01:18:45,352
You can't do this!

1169
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:48,922
I'll see you
on the other side.

1170
01:18:48,989 --> 01:18:50,890
Cousin.

1171
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:53,026
Forgive me.

1172
01:19:00,901 --> 01:19:02,736
[gunshot]

1173
01:19:18,919 --> 01:19:20,787
<i>[groans]</i>

1174
01:19:20,855 --> 01:19:22,656
<i>Not so bad.</i>

1175
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:26,226
<i>Only one candidate</i>
<i>for the tooth fairy.</i>

1176
01:19:26,293 --> 01:19:28,462
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1177
01:19:28,529 --> 01:19:32,065
<i>I almost forgot</i>
<i>what they did, what I did.</i>

1178
01:19:32,132 --> 01:19:34,901
[Nikolai]
Radiant dawn, my son.

1179
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:49,750
I used to have a watch
just like that.

1180
01:19:52,553 --> 01:19:56,757
It was given to me
many years ago.

1181
01:19:59,894 --> 01:20:01,995
I'm sorry about your cousin.

1182
01:20:02,062 --> 01:20:04,765
You did not deserve
his loyalty.

1183
01:20:10,471 --> 01:20:13,206
Neither did I.

1184
01:20:13,274 --> 01:20:17,577
Will it truly be
a relief to die?

1185
01:20:17,645 --> 01:20:20,213
Not sure.

1186
01:20:20,281 --> 01:20:22,716
Never been dead yet.

1187
01:20:24,051 --> 01:20:26,052
Your situation,

1188
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:29,088
our situation,

1189
01:20:29,156 --> 01:20:36,029
reminds me of the books I
enjoyed when I was a younger man.

1190
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:39,999
I suppose there was no choice,

1191
01:20:40,067 --> 01:20:42,736
considering
who your parents are.

1192
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:47,541
Do you want to know the truth
about your father?

1193
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:52,779
I guess the answer
depends on who he was.

1194
01:20:55,015 --> 01:20:56,182
Or is.

1195
01:20:59,153 --> 01:21:02,255
Before you die,
I will tell you.

1196
01:21:02,323 --> 01:21:05,124
But first,
I have a question.

1197
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:11,230
Why not kill him
with dignity?

1198
01:21:11,298 --> 01:21:14,000
This grotesque thing
you have done,

1199
01:21:14,068 --> 01:21:19,639
trapping him in his body
to die a slow, terrible death.

1200
01:21:19,707 --> 01:21:21,875
Why?

1201
01:21:24,144 --> 01:21:27,280
I suppose I was
feeling metaphorical.

1202
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:32,986
Not good enough.

1203
01:21:33,053 --> 01:21:36,490
Why then surface here?

1204
01:21:36,557 --> 01:21:38,057
You won't like
the answer.

1205
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:40,627
How do you know?

1206
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:42,295
It's not very romantic.

1207
01:21:42,363 --> 01:21:43,730
Doesn't need to be.

1208
01:21:46,433 --> 01:21:49,870
A part of me knew you would
choose to face me alone.

1209
01:21:52,172 --> 01:21:54,374
You're right.

1210
01:21:54,441 --> 01:21:56,843
Not very romantic.

1211
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:06,052
Why then the sadness
when victory is imminent?

1212
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,723
There was a time
when I thought--

1213
01:22:09,790 --> 01:22:11,925
maybe even hoped--

1214
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:14,794
that you truly
were the one.

1215
01:22:16,864 --> 01:22:18,665
You don't think I am?

1216
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:21,100
You think
that two-faced fate

1217
01:22:21,168 --> 01:22:25,505
has destined you
to take my life?

1218
01:22:25,573 --> 01:22:28,274
You know that's not
what I'm talking about.

1219
01:22:30,878 --> 01:22:33,780
Then what are
we talking about?

1220
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:36,516
Why this intimate
face-to-face

1221
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:39,118
when you could have
killed so long ago?

1222
01:22:39,186 --> 01:22:42,622
You had so many
opportunities over the years.

1223
01:22:48,462 --> 01:22:51,965
Do you truly need to
see me die by your hand?

1224
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:58,872
What makes you sure that I will
be the one who dies this night?

1225
01:23:01,008 --> 01:23:04,177
I who taught the Rajah
the ways of the knife.

1226
01:23:04,244 --> 01:23:10,349
I who taught maybe even your
father the ways of the knife.

1227
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:13,519
I who taught you...

1228
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:15,589
the ways of the knife.

1229
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:21,895
That was a very,
very long time ago.

1230
01:23:21,963 --> 01:23:27,166
There are those who say
that amongst the masters,

1231
01:23:27,234 --> 01:23:34,040
the fight is won and lost
in the minds of the combatants

1232
01:23:34,108 --> 01:23:37,210
before either one
makes a move.

1233
01:23:40,147 --> 01:23:44,484
Are you now
one such master, my son?

1234
01:23:46,353 --> 01:23:51,557
How do you expect to survive
against all these men in these halls?

1235
01:23:55,395 --> 01:24:00,700
How do you expect to survive against
your bastardized, unfulfilled life?

1236
01:24:03,303 --> 01:24:05,839
How do you expect
to survive against me?

1237
01:24:05,906 --> 01:24:08,274
Because...

1238
01:24:11,245 --> 01:24:14,313
I want to kill you
more than you want to live.

1239
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:21,054
<i>Nikolai always</i>
<i>goes for the heart.</i>

1240
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:30,096
<i>He never missed...</i>

1241
01:24:30,164 --> 01:24:31,397
<i>- until now.</i>
<i>-</i> Your father--

1242
01:24:31,465 --> 01:24:33,266
Shh.

1243
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:41,675
<i>For want of a tooth,</i>
<i>a kingdom was lost.</i>

1244
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:48,414
<i>Like I always say,</i>

1245
01:24:48,482 --> 01:24:50,684
<i>some things are</i>
<i>better left in the dark.</i>

1246
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:58,624
<i>One bullet out of ten</i>
<i>in the clip.</i>

1247
01:25:06,233 --> 01:25:08,634
<i>Rounds two and three.</i>

1248
01:25:11,371 --> 01:25:12,806
<i>Four.</i>

1249
01:25:12,873 --> 01:25:14,874
Das vadanya, <i>Nikolai.</i>

1250
01:25:14,942 --> 01:25:16,710
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

1251
01:25:19,379 --> 01:25:21,647
<i>Damn. Five was low.</i>

1252
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:24,350
<i>Try six on for size.</i>

1253
01:25:28,555 --> 01:25:30,623
<i>Here comes seven and eight.</i>

1254
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:52,645
<i>Just as I thought,</i>
<i>as rotten as Denmark.</i>

1255
01:26:05,926 --> 01:26:08,762
<i>Nine, ten.</i>

1256
01:26:45,933 --> 01:26:47,133
[shouts]

1257
01:27:01,081 --> 01:27:02,481
[gunshot]

1258
01:27:16,663 --> 01:27:19,232
Always sleeping on the job.

1259
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:20,399
Wake up.

1260
01:27:20,467 --> 01:27:21,701
[coughs]

1261
01:27:21,768 --> 01:27:24,170
- Come on, wake up.
- What are you doing here?

1262
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:25,571
You know how it is.

1263
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:29,008
Weekend, out cruising with
the boys, looking for a party.

1264
01:27:30,311 --> 01:27:32,178
You look better than usual.

1265
01:27:34,048 --> 01:27:36,749
I imagine you slept through
all this mayhem

1266
01:27:36,817 --> 01:27:39,452
and really had nothing
to do with any of it.

1267
01:27:39,519 --> 01:27:41,921
You know
I never carry a gun.

1268
01:27:41,989 --> 01:27:44,523
How are you still alive?

1269
01:27:48,495 --> 01:27:50,529
Now, you tell her
this is the last time.

1270
01:27:50,597 --> 01:27:54,367
I don't owe her any more
favors, thank God.

1271
01:27:54,434 --> 01:27:57,603
You, I owe a couple more,

1272
01:27:57,671 --> 01:28:00,907
but somehow I don't think
you're ever gonna collect.

1273
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:03,409
<i>I hope you're right,</i>
<i>good Pavlovitch.</i>

1274
01:28:03,477 --> 01:28:05,678
<i>I seem to be experiencing</i>
<i>a bit of an epiphany.</i>

1275
01:28:05,746 --> 01:28:07,480
So long, brother.

1276
01:28:07,547 --> 01:28:09,448
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>in my life,</i>

1277
01:28:09,516 --> 01:28:12,218
<i>I feel like I've been</i>
<i>part of a job well done.</i>

1278
01:28:12,286 --> 01:28:15,922
The operative word
being "done."

1279
01:28:17,657 --> 01:28:19,725
<i>Can you hear me, Mother?</i>

1280
01:28:21,395 --> 01:28:24,830
<i>I could really use</i>
<i>some help right now.</i>

1281
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:28,134
[groaning]

1282
01:28:32,472 --> 01:28:35,341
[loud groaning]

1283
01:28:35,409 --> 01:28:38,778
<i>I wonder when George</i>
<i>realized this place was it,</i>

1284
01:28:38,845 --> 01:28:41,114
<i>that he would never achieve</i>
<i>such heights again.</i>

1285
01:28:44,785 --> 01:28:47,853
<i>Did George know his father?</i>

1286
01:28:47,922 --> 01:28:50,256
<i>Did George kill his father?</i>

1287
01:29:09,443 --> 01:29:13,146
<i>If can just do what you did,</i>
<i>dear Mother,</i>

1288
01:29:13,213 --> 01:29:15,881
<i>and make a leap of faith.</i>

1289
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:21,220
<i>But so far, just enough for</i>
<i>Mr. Newton's messy lesson.</i>

1290
01:29:21,288 --> 01:29:24,457
<i>Just enough for 32 feet per</i>
<i>second squared to take over.</i>

1291
01:29:27,461 --> 01:29:29,762
<i>Almost there, Mother.</i>

1292
01:29:31,798 --> 01:29:34,300
<i>Oh, fuck!</i>

1293
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:39,605
<i>I guess there's goes plan B.</i>

1294
01:29:41,008 --> 01:29:42,275
<i>Damn.</i>

1295
01:29:42,343 --> 01:29:44,143
[panting]

1296
01:29:44,211 --> 01:29:47,080
<i>Body's broken...</i>

1297
01:29:47,147 --> 01:29:49,282
<i>and I'm losing blood fast...</i>

1298
01:29:50,951 --> 01:29:53,052
<i>but not fast enough.</i>

1299
01:29:56,457 --> 01:29:58,824
[screams]

1300
01:30:03,263 --> 01:30:05,031

1301
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:08,001
[panting]

1302
01:30:29,123 --> 01:30:34,193
[screams]

1303
01:30:35,729 --> 01:30:37,830
[grunts]

1304
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:53,112
Lyovshka.

1305
01:31:04,158 --> 01:31:05,358
Why?

1306
01:31:05,426 --> 01:31:07,460
[sobbing]

1307
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:09,228
Why?

1308
01:31:11,432 --> 01:31:13,799
Tell me why.

1309
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:19,272
They would have killed you.

1310
01:31:19,339 --> 01:31:23,709
And yet you would kill
yourself in the process?

1311
01:31:23,777 --> 01:31:27,046
If necessary.

1312
01:31:27,114 --> 01:31:30,716
Necessary?

1313
01:31:30,784 --> 01:31:35,588
Did you ever stop and think for
a second what that would do to me?

1314
01:31:37,691 --> 01:31:40,226
Please don't.

1315
01:31:40,294 --> 01:31:42,395
Look at me.

1316
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:45,398
Look at me.

1317
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:49,435
No...

1318
01:31:49,503 --> 01:31:51,471
What's that?

1319
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:55,074
What's this?

1320
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:59,579
After all your silly posturing,
you want to do this?

1321
01:32:02,082 --> 01:32:04,283
Please go away!

1322
01:32:04,351 --> 01:32:06,319
Please stop!

1323
01:32:06,386 --> 01:32:07,453
Just go.

1324
01:32:07,521 --> 01:32:10,256
You come into my life,

1325
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:13,659
you come into my daughter's
life for what? For this?

1326
01:32:13,727 --> 01:32:15,294
Go away!

1327
01:32:17,464 --> 01:32:19,198
Why?

1328
01:32:19,266 --> 01:32:20,566
Why? Why?

1329
01:32:20,634 --> 01:32:23,068
Why? It's not fair!

1330
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:28,508
Why? Why?
Look at me! Look at me!

1331
01:32:28,575 --> 01:32:29,808
Why?

1332
01:32:34,281 --> 01:32:38,351
[sobs]

1333
01:32:38,418 --> 01:32:41,654
It will do more damage
this way.

1334
01:33:09,749 --> 01:33:12,951
No, no.

1335
01:33:13,019 --> 01:33:16,055
No. We cannot!

1336
01:33:19,893 --> 01:33:22,061
You sent me away!

1337
01:33:22,128 --> 01:33:24,063
You never asked me
to return!

1338
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:27,233
I did.
Every single day, I did.

1339
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:29,235
I just never used words.

1340
01:33:29,303 --> 01:33:31,136
[crying]

1341
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:33,906
Please. Please stop.
Stop thinking.

1342
01:33:33,973 --> 01:33:37,776
Stop listening to yourself
and listen to me.

1343
01:33:37,844 --> 01:33:39,512
Listen to me.

1344
01:33:41,481 --> 01:33:45,117
I have always loved you.

1345
01:33:45,185 --> 01:33:48,754
Always so much.

1346
01:33:48,822 --> 01:33:52,425
- I always shall, I promise.
- Oh, God.

1347
01:33:52,492 --> 01:33:55,861
[speaking Russian]

1348
01:33:55,929 --> 01:33:59,532
You're lying.
You love me.

1349
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:04,803
Nothing about me...
is honest.

1350
01:34:04,871 --> 01:34:08,574
Nothing about us...
is honest.

1351
01:34:08,642 --> 01:34:10,175
Don't lie. Don't.

1352
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:12,044
[sobs]

1353
01:34:12,112 --> 01:34:13,446
Go.

1354
01:34:16,082 --> 01:34:18,150
Oh, God.

1355
01:34:18,218 --> 01:34:21,287
[crying]
I love you!

1356
01:34:21,355 --> 01:34:22,722
[Ivan]
Porphyria!

1357
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:26,692
Mommy?

1358
01:34:27,761 --> 01:34:30,028
No! No!

1359
01:34:30,096 --> 01:34:32,164
- No.
- Why?

1360
01:34:32,232 --> 01:34:34,800
- You must go back to him.
- Why?

1361
01:34:34,868 --> 01:34:38,036
You must go back to her.
You're her mother.

1362
01:34:39,473 --> 01:34:41,607
Please... don't.

1363
01:34:41,675 --> 01:34:44,510
Don't leave me now.
Not now.

1364
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:47,980
Please...

1365
01:34:53,887 --> 01:34:55,254
Please...

1366
01:35:08,868 --> 01:35:10,068
Porphyria!

1367
01:35:12,406 --> 01:35:14,139
Oh, my God.

1368
01:35:23,383 --> 01:35:25,150
After this last time...

1369
01:35:26,986 --> 01:35:29,221
I will never
leave you again.

1370
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:40,933
[Ivan]
Porphyria!

1371
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,035
What's wrong?

1372
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:53,312
Nothing, Ivan.

1373
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:55,047
Nothing.

1374
01:35:56,249 --> 01:35:59,352
Everything is finally perfect.

1375
01:36:26,847 --> 01:36:28,681
What is it?

1376
01:36:35,121 --> 01:36:38,491
There are certain things
we shall never know.

1377
01:36:42,996 --> 01:36:46,832
I have never allowed myself
to be happy, Ivan.

1378
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:48,768
I'm going to try it
for a change.

1379
01:36:51,438 --> 01:36:52,838
And where is he?

1380
01:36:56,476 --> 01:36:59,311
Are you certain
he didn't bleed to death?

1381
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,616
You want me
to go and find him?

1382
01:37:07,788 --> 01:37:08,987
No.

1383
01:37:09,055 --> 01:37:14,760
This world is not kind
to those like him.

1384
01:37:14,828 --> 01:37:18,864
Might have been better
if he... if he died.

1385
01:37:20,366 --> 01:37:24,737
What can he do now?
He has no cause to fight.

1386
01:37:27,541 --> 01:37:31,209
He has only a dream
that will drive him mad.

1387
01:37:31,277 --> 01:37:33,979
Ivan, you promised.

1388
01:37:42,889 --> 01:37:44,857
Insanity is hereditary,
you know.

1389
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:51,163
He has too much
of his mother in him.

1390
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:53,999
Thank God.

1391
01:37:54,067 --> 01:37:55,868
That's his best part.

1392
01:38:02,008 --> 01:38:05,778
But like you, my dear,

1393
01:38:05,846 --> 01:38:08,280
he is his
father's child, too.

1394
01:38:10,316 --> 01:38:12,351
Whoever that truly was.

1395
01:38:14,855 --> 01:38:16,856
Between brothers...

1396
01:38:19,092 --> 01:38:21,393
especially
those brothers...

1397
01:38:25,565 --> 01:38:28,300
the bloodline is
too much the same.

1398
01:38:31,471 --> 01:38:33,071
I know.

1399
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:53,125
<i>I told you it would not end</i>
<i>like it began.</i>

1400
01:38:53,192 --> 01:38:55,193
<i>Not really.</i>

1401
01:38:55,261 --> 01:38:57,997
<i>This is a happy ending,</i>
<i>after all.</i>

1402
01:38:58,064 --> 01:38:59,965
<i>And the kind of story</i>
<i>we've been thinking of</i>

1403
01:39:00,033 --> 01:39:03,201
<i>isn't supposed to have</i>
<i>a happy ending.</i>

1404
01:39:03,269 --> 01:39:07,139
But this is the happiest ending
for all of us.

1405
01:39:07,206 --> 01:39:13,278
<i>You see, in our own way,</i>
<i>she is mine and I am hers.</i>

1406
01:39:13,346 --> 01:39:17,349
<i>Perfection and imperfection.</i>

1407
01:39:17,417 --> 01:39:20,352
<i>That is why</i>
<i>I close my eyes now.</i>

1408
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:24,289
<i>I realize what</i>
<i>she has taught me.</i>

1409
01:39:24,357 --> 01:39:29,061
<i>An imperfect sleep can be</i>
<i>the most perfect one of all.</i>

1410
01:39:29,128 --> 01:39:32,097
<i>And now that I have had</i>
<i>a perfect sleep,</i>

1411
01:39:32,165 --> 01:39:35,434
<i>I will finally have</i>
<i>a different kind of sleep,</i>

1412
01:39:35,501 --> 01:39:38,503
<i>a sleep from which</i>
<i>I will never awaken again.</i>

1413
01:40:08,234 --> 01:40:11,837
<i># He's just a ghost #</i>

1414
01:40:11,905 --> 01:40:16,008
<i># A ghost of the past #</i>

1415
01:40:16,076 --> 01:40:19,712
<i># He was brought back #</i>

1416
01:40:19,779 --> 01:40:23,782
<i># For some foolish dream #</i>

1417
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:27,753
<i># Bereft and betwixt #</i>

1418
01:40:27,821 --> 01:40:32,057
<i># A world yet unknown #</i>

1419
01:40:32,125 --> 01:40:36,028
<i># Out of the past #</i>

1420
01:40:36,096 --> 01:40:39,798
<i># He walks on #</i>

1421
01:40:39,866 --> 01:40:42,768
<i># The heat of his love #</i>

1422
01:40:42,836 --> 01:40:47,840
<i># Has made him cold #</i>

1423
01:40:47,907 --> 01:40:52,344
<i># The blood will run deep</i>
<i>with the gun you can't keep #</i>

1424
01:40:52,411 --> 01:40:56,849
<i># Before the perfect sleep #</i>

1425
01:40:56,916 --> 01:41:00,953
<i># The perfect sleep #</i>

1426
01:41:01,021 --> 01:41:04,823
